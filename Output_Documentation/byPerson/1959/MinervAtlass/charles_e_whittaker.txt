justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
is
this
material
to
our
question
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
know
whether
there
is
uniformity
among
these
rules?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
hasn't
that
always
been
true,
i
couldn't
agree
with
you
more
so
let
me
say
first,
now
then
hasn't
that
always
been
the
case
so
in
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
admiralty
litigation
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
i'm
talking
about
the
desirability
of
it
from
the
reasons
you've
just
been
arguing.
that's
all
--
those
--
those
reasons
have
always
existed.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
whole
basis
of
this
last
question
of
mine
was
of
what
can
you
tell
us
was
the
reason
why
rule
26,
the
federal
rules
or
something
like
it
hasn't
always
existed
alongside
in
admiralty
--
alongside
law
in
equity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
mr.
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
liebenson.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
it
true
that
we
cross
this
bridge
of
whether
this
type
of
investigation
is
worthy
years
ago
with
the
passage
of
rule
26
under
the
civil
rules.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
know.
now
then,
your
problem
is
it
seems
to
me,
number
two,
one,
if
it's
good
there,
would
it
not
feel
the
same
beneficent
office
in
admiralty.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
now
next,
has
the
supreme
court
given
the
power
to
take
discovery
depositions
in
admiralty
cases.
isn't
that
your
whole
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
you
say
that
in
discovery
depositions,
you
may
not
use
them
at
the
trial.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
but
commonly
they
are.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
let's
take
on
the
rule
26.
you
served
unnoticed
to
take
depositions
under
rule
26
in
the
civil
case.
you
can
do
some
fishing
in
it,
alright,
but
that
testimony
is
still
usable
before
the
jury,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
law.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
rule
26.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
but
this
--
well
now
but
this
court
has
--
the
district
judges
said
it
under
rule
44,
the
local
courts
could
adopt
the
local
rules.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
the
local
rules
then
adopt
rule
26.
so
you
do
have
it
that
way,
don't
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
court
of
appeals
did.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
all
i
mean
to
indicate
was
it
seems
to
me
your
problem
is
not
to
argue
whether
taking
of
this
depositions
is
good
or
bad,
but
rather
it
is
whether
the
power
exists.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
think
they
should.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
however,
it
substitutes
the
discoveries
but
they
are
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
could
you
say
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
to
a
point
(inaudible)
if
he
wants
to.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
except
for
these
(inaudible
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
that's
a
matter
of
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
and
this
matter
subsequent
to
that
and
the

found
the
(inaudible)

charles
e.
whittaker
they
have
not
followed
the
rules.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
hayes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
could
you
please
â€“
might
i
ask
you
please
sir,
would
it
be
my
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
it
be
more
--
would
it
be
more
rough
to
use
the
word
in
an
admiralty
case
than
it
would
be
in
a
civil
case
in
a
law
side?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that
sir?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
whether
this
court
found,
is
it
a
good
idea
or
not
has
this
court
authorized
the
--
such
rule?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker

interrogatories.
justice
charles
