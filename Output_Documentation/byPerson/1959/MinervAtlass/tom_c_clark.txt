justice
tom
c.
clark
from
what
place?
i
haven't
yet
understood.
do
you
derive
--
you
think
the
local
court
derives
authority
to
promulgate
the
rule
of
this
connection?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
maybe
wrong
but
i
have
a
recollection
of
the
time
that
this
matter
was
presented
to
this
court
by
a
number
of
the
--
members
of
the
admiralty
bar
and
it
was
passed.
we
take
up
rules
permitting
to
a
point
and
finally
decided
not
to
do
so.
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
you
know
anything
about
that?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
you
have
the
problem
there
of
whether
or
not
it's
in
conflict.
justice
tom
c.
clark
either
by
the
--
either
by
the
rules
that
have
been
adopted
here,
the
rules
that
have
not
been
adopted
but
it
have
been
presented,
i
should
think.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
can't.
i
don't
quite
understand,
never
had
pretty
understood
the
difference
between
what's
substantive
and
what's
procedural?
justice
tom
c.
clark
this
is
a
pretty
important
thing?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'm
not
saying
yes
to
this.
i
mean
the
point
i
gave
you.
justice
tom
c.
clark
it's
particularly
important,
i
should
think
if
(voice
overlap)
to
give
it
a
name
that
was
intended
to
review
such
importance
to
the
litigants.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i've
always
thought
of
it
is
having
a
very
important
effect
on
the
trial
and
being
very
closely
related
to
it.
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
a
trial?
justice
tom
c.
clark
how
many
have
--
have
many
of
them
there.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
it's
very
important
to
get
affected
by
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
are
you
asking
the
improvement
of
a
rule
which
simply
permits
questions
to
be
asked
and
not
litigate,
they
have
no
benefit
from
it
at
all?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
accept
that.
you
couldn't
use
it
to
contradict
or
you
couldn't
use
it
for
anything
else?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
they're
not
uniform,
are
they,
in
the
way
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
said
you
can
make
out
of
them
in
the
manner
in
which
you
can
take
them
and
so
forth.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
don't
see
how
that
will
come
before
us.
i
don't
state
my
view
about
it,
but
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
i
don't
state
my
view
about
it
now.
i
don't
understand
fully
your
argument
there.
i
don't
see
how
you
would
be
justified
according
to
our
rule
which
gives
all
this
power
and
it
is
a
lot
and
a
deposition
is
a
big
thing
when
you
run
all
across
the
country
to
getting
it
and
then
to
say
that
they
couldn't
be
used
on
both
sides,
like
they
do
in
the
civil
rules
which
seem
to
me
to
be
of
great
draw
instead
of
an
advantage.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
i
--
i
could
not
say
that
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
construe
a
statute
as
authorizing
any
institution
of
local
rule
to
make
that
limited
use
of
it
and
then
say
they
couldn't
--
it
didn't
have
authority
if
they
use
it
fully
except
the
fact
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
was
that
at
the
time
that
the
court
sent
inquiry
with
the
different
circuits
as
to
the
--
as
admiralty
business
asking
them
to
sound
out
the
views
of
the
bar.
do
you
know?
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
that
the
association
committee
or
--?
justice
tom
c.
clark
title
28,
you
say?
justice
tom
c.
clark
report
of
committee
on
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
how
is
it
done
now?
could
you
tell
me
in
just
--
would
it
interrupt
you
to
tell
me
and
very
briefly
just
how
you
do
get
your
information
now?
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes.
justice
tom
c.
clark
can
he
file
--
can
he
file
the
interrogatory?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
can
you
file
an
interrogatory?
justice
tom
c.
clark
are
they
verified
--
do
they
have
to
be
verified?
justice
tom
c.
clark
if
he
does
not
answer.
justice
tom
c.
clark
mr.
hayes,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
hadn't
been
discussed
the
practical
part
of
it,
i
assume.
are
you
an
active
practitioner
now?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'm
trying
to
find
out
how
this
works.
suppose
now
you
had
this
rule
that
the
deposition
that
you
are
talking
about,
you
were
in
chicago,
the
other
side
notifies
you
that
they
have
a
witness
in
california.
do
you
have
to
go
there
or
have
somebody
there
to
represent
you
to
take
the
evidence
of
that
witness?
is
--
what's
the
provision
with
reference
to
call?
