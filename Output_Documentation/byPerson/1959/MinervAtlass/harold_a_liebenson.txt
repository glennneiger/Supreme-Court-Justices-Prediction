mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
this
is
a
case
in
admiralty.
it
arose
out
of
an
occurrence
in
october
26,
1956,
where
two
men
were
drowned
in
the
detroit
harbor
basin,
who
were
alleged
as
crewmen
of
a
yacht
known
as
sis,
while
returning
from
their
shore
leave.
each
men
left
a
wife
and
three
children,
and
the
only
persons
present
at
the
scene
of
this
occurrence
were
members
of
the
crew
or
members
who
were
employees
of
the
owner
of
the
yacht.
in
an
effort
to
get
information,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
filed
a
motion
for
to
--
for
discovery
depositions
as
to
one
of
the
parties
and
two
or
three
of
the
employees.
the
lower
court
granted
said
motion
and
i
must
point
out
that
there
was
a
local
admiralty
rule
in
this
court
and
the
respondent
then
took
--
sought
a
mandamus
and
prohibition
writ
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
prevent
the
taking
of
said
depositions,
oral
and
pretrial
for
discovery
purposes
only
and
judge
lynn
parkinson
wrote
a
--
an
opinion,
holding
that
the
writ
of
prohibition
and
mandamus
should
issue,
which
was
issued,
preventing
the
taking
of
the
oral
discovery
depositions
and
further
held
that
the
local
admiralty
rule
for
this
district,
rule
32
was
void
in
that
it
exceeded
the
power
of
the
local
court.
this
court
granted
certiorari.
i
--
i
might
point
out
one
other
thing.
this
is
an
admiralty
because
of
a
limitation
action.
previous
to
the
limitation
action
being
filed,
a
jones
act
suit
was
filed
by
one
of
the
deceased
--
decedent's
representatives
and
the
--
then
the
limitation
action
was
filed
and
an
injunction
was
issued
preventing
the
proceeding
under
the
jones
act.
so
that
the
question
we
have
is
whether
or
not,
oral
pretrial
discovery
depositions
are
permissible
in
an
admiralty
case.
the
question
is
only
--
is
one
of
procedure
but
it
affects
the
whole
of
the
admiralty
bar
because
it
would
--
if
the
court
so
holds
in
accordance
with
the
seventh
circuit,
it
will
mean
that
it's
going
to
change
the
practice
and
procedure
of
the
admiralty
lawyers
throughout
the
country.
i
say
this
because
the
following
district
courts
in
the
following
states
have
similar
admiralty
rule
--
local
admiralty
rules
pertaining
to
depositions,
pretrial
depositions,
as
similar
to
the
one
we
have
in
our
state,
new
york,
pennsylvania
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
both
the
southern
and
eastern
districts
of
new
york
have
rule
32
sir
as
to
dep
--
oral
pretrial
deposition.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
and
the
eastern.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
in
the
mercado
case?
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no,
sir.
he
mentioned
that
it
wasn't
discussed.
this
all
came
after
the
--
the
new
york
rules,
sir,
came
into
effect
after
the
kelleher
case
when
judge
kaufman
was
appointed
to
the
committee
to
formulate
a
rule
and
--
and
then
the
rule
and
the
practice
followed
thereafter.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
so
was
the
kelleher
if
i
remember
correctly.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
if
it
was,
sir,
it
is
mentioned
in
the
mercado,
but
not
discussed
or
taken
as
part
of
the
--
as
taken
as
part
of
the
case.
we
have
--
i
have
it
outlined
in
here
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
is
not
based
on
that,
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir,
and
it
is
the
uniform
and
universal
practice
of
all
lawyers
in
new
york
to
follow
such
rule.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
right,
sir,
but
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no.
the
--
the
--
the
--
what
i
have
meant
to
say
was
that
the
--
in
the
mercado
case
is
not
the
law
today.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no,
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
by
the
--
by
the
local
court
rule.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
because
sir
it
is
a
question
--
in
the
first
place,
sir,
the
mercado
case
passed
on
the
proposition
of
whether
or
not,
the
court
had
the
right
to
accept
a
--
evidence
deposition
as
evidence
and
not
as
to
the
taking
of
evidence.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i'm
trying
to
help
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
what
is
the
point
of
the
case?
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
because
one
is
--
one
is
a
pretrial
discovery
deposition
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
--
for
the
purpose
of
discovery
and
the
other
is
for
the
using
of
the
--
of
evidence
--
of
the
deposition
as
evidence
in
a
trial
and
there
is
a
great
distinction
between
the
two.
in
a
pretrial
discovery
deposition,
all
you're
trying
to
seek
is
information.
in
taking
an
evidence
deposition
or
when
you
try
to
utilize
evidence
from
a
pretrial
deposition,
you
need
a
substantive
law
or
substantive
right
to
give
you
this.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i'd
love
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
we're
after
a
deposition
so
we
can
find
out
what
happened
because
we
have
two
men
who
have
died
and
all
the
people
who
were
around
the
scene
belong
to
the
boat
who
are
employees
and
we
can't
get
any
information
unless
we
ask
them
about
it.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir.
it's
not
for
the
trial.
it's
only
for
discovery
purposes
to
give
us
a
basis
to
proceed.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
unless
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir,
unless
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
for
impeachment
purposes
and
second
in
order
to
use
it
for
--
for
evidence
you
have
to
have
a
specific
statute
granting
you
the
right
to
do
so.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i'd
say,
yes
sir
because
anything
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i
don't
consider
the
mercado
decision
the
law
sir,
because
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
--
because
there
has
been
so
much.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes.
that's
my
point,
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
since
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i
--
i
thought
i
made
the
statement
too,
your
honor
that
the
practice
in
new
york
is
that
there
is
universal
taking
of
discovery
depositions
in
admiralty
cases
based
upon
the
local
rule.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
the
question
that
i
say
is
my
--
this
is
my
opinion.
the
answer
is
yes
because
you
are
not
using
it.
when
you
use
something
for
impeachment,
you
are
not
using
it
as
direct
evidence.
you
are
using
it
to
refute
a
story
that
someone
is
telling
from
the
witness
stand
whereas
if
you
took
evidence,
a
deposition,
then
you
would
read
all
the
evidence
into
the
case
as
though
it
were
a
witness
testifying
on
the
stand.
in
this
other
situation
that
you
ask
me,
all
you
are
saying
to
the
person,
did
you
not
say
under
oath
or
at
this
and
this
time
and
then
you
only
ask
one
question
if
it
applies
and
only
it
has
to
be
material
when
applied.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i
think
so
and
i
tell
you
why
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
because
right
within
six
weeks
after
he
wrote
the
decision
in
the
mercado
case,
the
republic
of
france
versus
belships
case
came
up
which
--
where
it
was
decided
in
that
case
and
that
--
the
citation
on
that
is
district
court
1950
and
the
citation
184,
f
2d
119.
in
that
case,
the
court,
the
lower
court,
decided
that
as
long
as
there
was
a
rule,
a
local
rule,
then
you
are
entitled
to
pretrial
discovery
deposition.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
yes
sir
and
then
the
same
--
at
that
time,
the
attorney
did
as
the
attorney
in
our
case
did,
sought
a
mandamus
and
prohibition
--
no,
just
a
mandamus
action
into
the
court
of
appeals
asking
that
this
be
prevented.
and
in
the
--
in
the
republic
of
france
versus
belships
case,
the
judge
clark
who
sat
--
who
wrote
the
mercado
case
and
also
said
on
the
--
in
the
decision
of
that
case
held
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
mandamus
and
in
effect
held
that
the
lower
court
ruling
was
correct.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i'd
said
so
yes
on
a
different
basis
but
i'd
say
that
they
are
--
they
are
in
contradiction.
we
cite
the
dowling
case
as
a
basis
in
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
for
permitting
oral
discovery
depositions.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir.
but
not
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
the
law
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
is
the
--
is
the
law
that
has
been
cited
in
the
--
in
the
cases
which
i
would
be
glad
to
--
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
but
which
hold
that
where
there
has
been
where
there
is
a
local
rule
in
force,
then
you
have
the
right
to
take
an
oral
discovery
deposition
and
that
came
up
in
the
ludina
case.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i
--
if
i
--
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
if
the
court
please,
we
presented
letters
and
i
have
many
more
from
all
the
leading
practitioners
in
admiralty.
these
are
the
largest
firms
in
new
york.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
and
they
have
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
and
they
--
there
isn't
one
who
has
followed
that
since.
now
with
regard
to
the
practice
of
the
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
local
rule
exists.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
new
york
and
then
there
is
pennsylvania,
maryland,
north
carolina,
if
your
honor
would
want
the
rule
numbers,
i
can
give
it
to
you,
south
carolina,
virginia,
canal
zone,
florida,
louisiana,
texas,
ohio,
missouri,
alaska,
california,
washington
and
oregon.
i'd
like
to
point
out
also
that
some
of
these
rules,
for
instance,
in
texas
and
in
ohio
have
been
existence
for
28
and
30
years.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir
we
have
a
notice
to
the
statistics
here.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir,
but
i
have
them
all
here.
this
has
been
some
research
since.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
because
sir,
it's
material
in
that
if
this
rule,
if
the
court
holds
that
pretrial
oral
discovery
depositions
are
not
permissible
in
admiralty
cases,
that
means
that
everyone
of
these
states
which
have
local
rules
and
which
are
the
coastal
states
and
which
are
the
great
lake
states
that
handle
all
the
admiralty
cases
are
going
to
have
change
their
whole
practice
and
their
whole
procedures.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
practically
every
rule,
there
is
uniformity.
there
is
a
difference
of
wording.
some
say
that
it
will
follow
the
frcp
26.
others
say
that
they
are
permissible
in
the
use,
in
the
taking
and
then
they
list
this
to
the
use
but
they
all
say
the
same
thing
in
effect.
and
--
and
it's
--
it's
been
very
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
i'd
de
glad
to.
the
--
this
oral
deposition
is
such
a
vital
and
important
factor
because
of
--
of
very
many
things.
first,
they
have
become
--
it's
become
the
established
admiralty
practice
throughout
the
country,
throughout
this
--
the
coastal
states
and
all
the
states
with
the
rules.
it's
given
lawyers
the
chance
--
a
tool
to
better
represent
their
clients
and
that's
on
both
sides
no
matter
which
side
your
honor.
it
gives
the
lawyers
the
chance
to
go
out
and
obtain
and
determine
the
facts.
it
eliminates
the
element
of
surprise
that
has
been
so
much
a
part
of
cases
in
the
past
and
that
has
--
they
have
tried
to
eliminate
at
the
present
time.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
in
what
sir?
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir.
they've
never
--
the
--
the
question
of
the
oral
deposition
for
discovery
was
never
gelled
until
the
rules
came
into
effect.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
excepting
that
as
we
get
to
use
a
tool
more
and
more,
if
you
learn
more
about
it
and
today,
for
instance,
we
spend
three
and
four
times
more
on
per
case
and
the
more
we
put
into
a
case,
the
more
we're
going
to
get
out
it
and
more
we're
going
to
realize
the
significance
of
our
work
when
it
is
finished.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
because
sir
there
was
never
an
adoption,
the
supreme
court
never
adopted
the
frcp
26
and
that
they
did
adopt
32
(c)
which
infers
the
right
and
then
all
the
speculation
arises
among
the
writers,
among
the
judges
and
everybody
as
to
what
--
what
--
why
did
--
why
did
they.
we
don't
know
that.
however,
in
going
through
my
cases
sir,
i
think
that
i
will
be
able
to
answer
some
of
that
for
you,
sir.
now
as
to
these
depositions,
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
outside
of
the
advantages
of
it
that
they
help
promote
--
they
help
dispose
the
cases
by
settlement
because
what
has
happened
in
the
past
and
i
speak
as
a
--
as
a
lawyer
who
comes
from
the
state
where
--
where
in
our
state
court
we're
waiting
six
and
a
half
years
now
for
a
trial
and
it's
very
important
to
us,
when
we're
--
when
we
get
to
the
deposition
definition
and
we're
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
our
federal
courts
have
done
quite
well.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
twenty
six,
in
the
record
it's
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
twenty
six-fifteen,
do
you
want
me
to
read
it,
sir?
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
page
15.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
now
when
--
when
attorney
--an
attorney
has
an
opportunity
to
face
the
witnesses
to
see
the
witnesses,
to
talk
to
them,
he's
got
a
right
to
come
back
to
his
plan
and
tell
them
that
what
his
feeling
is
with
reference
to
settlement,
with
reference
to
trial
and
so
forth.
we
have
been
utilizing
that
to
great
assistance,
because
take
this
case.
we're
not
permitted,
if
we're
not
permitted
to
go
ahead
and
take
oral
debt
--
discovery
depositions,
the
only
alternative
would
be
written
interrogatories.
now
for
written
interrogatories,
these
are
--
these
are
made
up
at
the
attorney's
office.
questions
are
in
advance,
the
attorney
can
ask
the
person
a
question,
then
write
it
down,
but
you
don't
get
the
opportunity
to
know
exactly
what
the
person
who
is
giving
the
information
knows.
whether
its
hearsay,
whether
this
person
is
going
to
make
a
good
witnessing
court,
whether
it's
a
personal
takes
a
very,
makes
a
believable
statement
and
whether
or
not
the
questions
that
are
so
important
to
determine
all
the
facts
can
be
answered
by
this
witness.
so,
how
can
an
attorney
on
their
faces
say
to
his
client,
“well
i
know
everything
about
this
case
and
this
is
what
i
recommend,
because
we're
--
we're
just
held
in
the
dark
and
yet
it's
pretty
difficult
to
make
a
recommendation
until
you
see
all
of
this
from
the
witness
stand.”
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no,
sir.
the
question
in
mercado,
they
tried
to
use
evidence.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
evidence,
yes
sir.
i
--
i
think
that
the
court
is
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir,
because
our
local
rule
is
divided
into
two
parts.
it's
divided
first
in
the
undertaking
and
then
as
to
the
use.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
we're
only
asking
about
the
taking.
we
only
want
the
taking.
we're
not
interested
in
the
use
because
we've
got
to
prepare
a
case
to
represent
these
people.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
we're
not
implying
anything
from
the
use.
sir,
the
whole
purpose
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
--
of
your
discovery
practice
is
to
obtain
information.
now,
how
are
we
going
to
know
what
these
people
saw.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
we
don't
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
if
a
person
comes
into
a
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
lying,
then
this
is
one
thing.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
it's
got
to
be
something,
sir,
material
for
instance,
if
a
--
if
you
ask
a
witness
on
a
deposition
of
what
day,
whether
it
was
a
monday,
or
tuesday,
or
wednesday,
that
--
that
isn't
important.
he
may
make
a
mistake,
but
what
if
it
goes
to
the
very
significant
thing
that
as
in
this
case,
that
there
was
no
board
so
these
man
could
get
on
or
off
this
boat
present
and
one
witness
says,
“this
witness
who
maybe
an
employer
or
someone
comes
in
and
tells
under
oath
that
this
is
so,
there
was
a
board
and
you
have
10
witnesses
who
will
say
there
is
no
board.
isn't
this
significant
for
you
to
know
so
you
can
tell
your
client
that
they
have
one
witness
who
says
it?
it's
an
evaluation
of
evidence.
we're
not
trying,
in
a
discovery
practice
you're
not
trying
to
get
people
to
lie
or
to
say
things
wrong.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
he
has
number
one,
he
has
the
transcript
with
which
to
read
as
to
what
his
testimony
was.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
fine
i'll
skip
that
part.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
it's
valuable
for
that.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
except
it
didn't
apply
to
admirality.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
that
is
a
point
of
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i
didn't
say
that,
sir.
i
said
the
mercado
said
that,
but
they
may
not
be
used
as
evidence
at
the
trial.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no,
sir.
it
cannot
be.
the
law
--
the
--
the
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
in
--
in
law.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
in
law.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
but
because
there
is
a
statute
and
a
rule
in
law
in
which
to
base
it.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
in
admiralty,
they
don't
have
it.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
right,
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
except
they
held
it
void
in
our
decision.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir
and
there
is
no
supreme
court
case
on
it.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
and
this
is
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
and
the
point,
the
point,
the
whole
point,
i
think,
is
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
basis
of
some
of
these
decisions
and
one
is
rule
46,
the
supreme
court
rule
46,
and
the
de
bene
esse
statute
and
the
interpretation
of
carpenter
--
carpenter
versus
winn
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
trial.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
alright
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well,
i
wouldn't
say
its
force,
i
just
say
it
doesn't
--
it
didn't
apply
in
our
particular
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
and
i'd
say
with
the
exception
of
the
cases
where
many
of
the
courts
have
said
that
section
32
(c)
infers
the
right
and
now
i'll
give
those
in
our
analysis
of
the
four
sets
of
cases.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no,
no.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no,
sir.
there
was
some
–
in
one
of
the
other
briefs
that
we
read,
there
was
some
discussion
about
the
maritime
law
association
had
some
discussion
about
it
and
then
we
don't
--
there
was
no
information
that
we've
been
able
to
obtain.
someone
else
may
have
it
and
we
tried
to
get
it
and
we
couldn't.
now,
the
significance
as
to
whether
or
not,
rule
44
applies
--
or
whether
rule
46
applies
and
the
de
bene
esse
applies,
i
think
should
be
taken
into
considerations.
in
the
first
place,
in
rule
46
to
the
supreme
court,
talks
about
in
all
trials
testimony
of
witnesses
shall
be
taken
orally
in
open
court
unless
otherwise
provided.
now,
counsel
in
his
brief
has
made
much
of
this
and
this
is
why
i
bring
it
up.
rule
46
applies
to
trials.
de
bene
esse
also
applies
to
taking
evidence
for
trial
purposes.
in
the
carpenter
versus
winn
case,
this
court
held
that
trial
does
not
include
the
pretrial
matters
or
matters
preliminary
to
trial.
the
purpose
i
bring
this
up
is
this.
if
we
were
trying
to
take
a
deposition
rule
for
evidence,
rule
46
and
the
de
bene
esse
statute
would
apply.
however,
where
we
take
a
pretrial
oral
discovery
deposition,
which
is
not
used
as
evidence
but
is
a
matter
preliminary
to
trial,
we
are
in
no
way
talking
about
a
trial
or
we
are
talking
about
evidence
for
a
trial.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
discovery
procedure
which
does
not
affect
any
substantive
right.
and
as
long
as
it
doesn't
affect
any
substantive
right,
then
we
know
that
we
do
not
need
a
special
statute
or
a
special
power
and
the
court
then
has
the
right
to
take
it
under
rule
44
in
2071
and
2073.
now,
of
all
the
cases
that
have
been
decided,
we
have
categorized
them
into
four
branches.
the
first,
the
cases
decided
prior
to
there
being
the
local
rule
are
where
a
local
rule
was
not
taken
into
consideration.
in
those
cases,
counsel
cites
three
cases;
one
the
mulligan
case,
two
the
mercado
case
and
three
the
kelleher
case.
now,
on
the
kelleher
case
which
was
in
1950
and
after
the
others,
the
judge
who
wrote
the
decision
in
that
case
denying
the
right
for
an
oral
deposition
became
the
judge
who
wrote
--
headed
the
committee
for
rule
46
which
is
now
their
local
rule
and
which
is
followed
to
this
day
in
the
practice.
all
these
have
been
southern
district
new
york
cases
that
counsel
has
cited.
in
the
second
category,
decisions
basing
the
right
to
take
the
pretrial
oral
discovery
depositions
because
of
admiralty
rule
32
(c),
we
cite
the
brown
versus
isthmian,
the
bunge,
the
ballantrae,
and
the
galperin
cases
which
appear
in
our
brief.
in
this
case
--
in
this
situation,
the
judges
took
the
attitude
that
section
32
(c)
written
as
it
was
has
sufficient
basis
to
infer
the
right
to
take
oral
pretrial
depositions.
in
the
first
group
of
cases,
there
was
no
local
rule
involved.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
that
was
the
first
case
in
which
he
held
that
if
the
court
did
not
have
a
rule
and
did
not
have
the
right
--
if
the
court
did
not
have
a
rule,
it
did
not
have
the
right
to
order
oral
pretrial
discovery
depositions.
that
was
the
first
one.
then
the
mercado
came
right
after
that.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
under
2071,
which
congress
gives
the
right
to
the
supreme
court
and
the
local
courts
to
make
the
rules
and
2073
which
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
statutes
or
the
supreme
court
rules
--
the
supreme
court
has
made
rule
44,
which
says
in
effect
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes,
sir,
the
admiralty
rule
44.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no,
sir.
i
know
that
there
was
a
meeting
some
time
ago
and
i
heard
that
there
was
an
appointment
or
possible
appointment
of
committees
to
revise
the
admiralty
rules
but
as
to
why
they
did
it,
i
don't
know
sir.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
do
know
that
under
rule
44,
you
have
the
--
the
local
courts
have
the
right
to
do
it
and
the
basis
that
i
have
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
in
conflict
with
what
sir
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
this
--
the
reason
i
say
it
is
not
in
conflict
and
not
inconsistent
is
because
in
the
making
of
the
local
admiralty
pretrial
discovery
rule,
the
court
is
not
involving
any
substantive
right.
all
the
court
is
doing
is
trying
to
regulate
their
practice
because
this
occurs
before
the
trial
and
is
preliminary
to
the
trial.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no,
i
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
in
decisions
--
in
the
decisions,
they
hold
that
you
cannot
enlarge
a
right
that
isn't
given
to
you
by
congress
or
by
the
legislature.
and
if
it
applies
to
the
trial,
the
courts
have
held
that
the
trial
--
the
fact
that
it
applies
to
trial
means
that
it
is
a
substantive
right
and
it
should
--
there
should
be
a
statute
or
a
provision
made
to
give
the
court
the
right
to
make
the
rule
where
you
have
the
situation
of
a
--
if
only
applying
to
the
regulating
of
the
practice.
in
other
words,
where
it
happened
before
the
trial,
a
matter
preliminary
to
the
trial,
then
it
is
a
procedural
aspect
of
a
case
because
it
doesn't
affect
the
trial.
it
doesn't
affect
their
rights
at
the
trial.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well,
evidence
deposition
--
if
you
take
an
evidence
deposition,
you
are
taking
it
would
--
you
would
need
a
requirement
because
you're
taking
evidence
deposition
for
a
trial
that's
in
substitute
of
a
witness
taking
the
stand.
that
is
not
our
situation.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
except
sir,
assume
--
assume
that
the
party
left
the
country
or
assume
that
the
party
died,
you
could
not
utilize
that
as
evidence
in
the
admiralty
cases
because
you
have
no
power
to
do
so.
if
the
party
--
if
the
party
lived
and
made
an
inconsistent
statement,
you
may
use
one
part
of
it
for
impeachment
purposes
and
that
isn't
the
evidence.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no,
sir.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
feel
that
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
it
de
--
doesn't
it
--
doesn't
it
depend,
sir,
upon
what
is
affected.
you
could
have
25
inconsistencies
in
a
trial
and
not
have
it
effecting
outcome
of
the
trial.
you
could
have
only
one.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i
know
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
right,
sir,
and
you
can
have
one
inconsistency
and
that
could
--
that
can
affect
your
whole
trial.
for
instance,
one
of
your
clients
doesn't
tell
you,
let's
say,
about
a
past
criminal
record
or
something
and
they
testify
they
didn't
have
it.
well,
this
has
affected
many
trials.
there
are
many,
many
--
but
it
depends
on
the
inconsistency
and
as
to
the
effect
it
has
on
the
trial.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i
think,
sir,
that
if
you're
getting
information,
the
litigants
are
getting
benefit
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
you
can
use
it
to
contradict
because
then
you're
not
--
this
is
not
evidence
but
you
could
not
use
it
as
evidence
in
a
case.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes,
sir.
it's
just
like
they
wrote
something
else
out
and
you
could
just
pick
up
any
statement
against
them.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
right,
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
right,
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes,
sir.
yes
sir,
we
do
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes,
sir
that's
all
(inaudible)
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well,
that
happens
too,
very
often.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
except
that
you
also
have
the
rule
that
if
you
don't
use
it,
they
can
use
it.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i
think
so,
sir.
i
think
so.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
except
that
i
still
say
that
the
local
courts
have
the
power
to
do
so.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
but
the
--
all
the
--
every
district
that
i
read
is
the
90
or
more
presented
above
the
admiralty
practice
in
many
districts
like
in
nebraska
and
that,
and
though
they
have
there,
nebraska
may
be,
there
are
no
admiralty
rules.
it
all
depends
upon
it.
it
--
it
is
the
rule
--
the
local
rules
that
arose
from
the
--
because
of
the
necessity
of
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
most
of
them.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
most
of
them
are
uniform
except
they're
not
verbatim.
the
effects
are
the
same.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well,
i
think
that
some
district
courts
have
followed
local
rules
in
addition
to
26.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well
this
is
--
none
of
this
is
in
conflict
with
it.
i
mean
at
no
time
this
is
in
conflict
because
you're
taking
oral
depositions,
there
is
not
--
it's
not
in
conflict
with
any
supreme
court
rule.
it's
not
in
conflict
with
any
statute
unless
you
did
it
by
--
if
you
did
it
as
a
deposition
for
evidence,
then
you'd
be
in
conflict
with
the
de
bene
esse
and
we
say
you
can't
do
it
for
that.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no,
sir.
in
the
dowling
case
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
--
he
said
--
judge
fee
says
that
you
have
the
right
to
take
as
a
matter
of
right.
ours
--
i
say
--
i
say,
it
says
under
rule
44
that
the
local
courts
have
the
power
as
well
as
the
right.
this
is
an
addition
to
it,
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
no
sir,
not
a
bit.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes,
sir.
i
was
trying
to
point
out
three
or
four
bases
that
you
could
use,
rule
that
the
deposition
is
good.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
inherit
right,
yes.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
under
44.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
i
think
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well
because,
i've
thought
i
explained
because
in
evidence,
you
would
need
a
statute
as
you
have
in
the
de
bene
esse
statute
to
permit
you
to
do
it,
but
this
you
wouldn't
need
it.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
because
it's
when
you're
using
it
at
a
trial
and
the
other
you're
using
it
prior
to
it
for
information.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
sir.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
except
sir
that
--
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
well
i
think
that's
because
of
the
cases
that
put
that
limitation
on
it.
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
sir?
mr.
harold
a.
liebenson
yes,
