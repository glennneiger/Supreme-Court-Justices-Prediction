honorable

robson,
petitioners,
versus
h.
leslie
atlass.
mr.
liebenson,
you
may
now
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
the
state
courts
exist?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
us
not
i
should
state
what
my
brother
whittaker
said
to
you,
a
little
differently.
he
said
the
correction
is
whether
this
court
has
given
the
district
court
the
power
to
order
a
pretrial
discovery.
i
should
defer
to
put
in
not
whether
it
has
given
it
because
plainly
it
hasn't
given
it,
but
whether
it
has
left
it
to
them.
and
the
argument
from
my
point
of
view
that
you
have
to
meet
is
that
this
court
in
1939
in
revising
the
admiralty
rules
explicitly
took
over
a
number
of
the
civil
procedure
rules,
but
as
the
second
circuit
found,
significantly
didn't
take
this
one
over.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hayes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
enlightens
me
a
little
bit
on
what
â€“
on
what
the
distinction
that
judge
fee
made
without
passing
on
it
between
the
requirements
of
a
party
as
against
the
witness.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hayes,
what
do
you
to
say
about
counsel's
statement
that
this
rule
does
exist
in
all
these
important
ports
like
new
york,
pennsylvania,
and
the
gulf
coast
though,
and
out
in
the
pacific
ocean?
do
they
or
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
just
going
to
say
by
not
being
uniform,
you
mean
not
uniform
in
express
verbiage
or
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
substance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
substance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
just
--
just
make
this
one
suggestion.
counsel
is
going
to
furnish
us
with
the
list
of
the
--
of
the
rules
in
these
various
jurisdictions
together
with
the
numbers
of
the
rules.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
going
to
say,
mr.
hayes,
if
you
disagree
with
the
--
with
the
statement
in
that
regard,
will
you
--
will
you
file
just
a
brief
memorandum
on
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
yes,
that's
alright
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
western
that
would
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
we'll
adjourn
now.
