justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
interrupt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
southern
district
of
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
the
southern
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
the
--
was
that
rule
before
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
in
judge
clark's
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
the
mercado
case
was
decided
in
1950.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
was
there
a
rule
in
existence
promulgated
by
the
southern
district
court
of
the
southern
district
prior
to
the
adjudication
in
mercado?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
but
the
decision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
based
on
that,
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
was
such
a
rule
then
the
decision
must
be
nullified.
let
me
ask
this
for
short,
is
that
the
rule
today?
can
you
say
that
today
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
there
is
such
a
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
would
you
clear
up
my
--
i
don't
understand.
i
understand
the
mercado
decision
to
say
that
that
is
beyond
the
power
of
courts,
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
how
can
it
be
still
persisting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
has
that
been
overruled
by
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
could
the
district
court
overrule
the
court
of
appeals
even
in
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
--
i
get
darker
and
darker
on
this
subject.
what
is
the
point
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
if
we
can't
use
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
point
of
authorizing
the
taking
of
their
position
if
it's
inadmissible
as
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
it
be
used
for
trial
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
take
your
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
what
are
you
after
here,
the
deposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the
information
that
was
authorized
by
judge
miner
and
judge
--
well
judge
miner
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
that
be
useful
to
get
about
the
decision?
would
that
be
utilized
here
by
you
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
basis
--
the
basis
on
which
subsequently,
but
you
can't
use
it.
is
it
a
general
rule
that
you
can't
use
what
you
get
in
a
pre
--
pretrial
discovery?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
can
you
use
it
--
at
miner
of
course.
can
you
use
it?
could
we
use
it
for
impeachment
purposes
if
you
are
going
to
prevail
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
under
the
mercado
decision
of
judge
clark?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
if
it
isn't
the
law.
what
i
want
to
know
is
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
and
i
want
to
know
whether
that
governed
litigation
of
southern
district
of
new
york.
and
the
reason
i
persist
about
the
southern
district
of
new
york
is
because
that
of
course
is
the
most
important
admiralty
centre
in
the
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so,
it's
important
for
me
to
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
the
practice,
the
allowable
practice
in
new
york
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
my
question
is
whether
with
mercado
on
the
books,
could
a
proctor
in
new
york
impeach,
use
the
pretrial
discovery
materials
for
impeachment
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
this
case
--
if
this
question,
the
use
a
free
trial
discovery
material
for
impeachment
purposes
came
up
before
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit,
judge
clark
sitting,
he
would
say
that
the
mercado
case
doesn't
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
decision
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
--
am
i
wrong
or
right
in
finding
judge
clark's
opinion
in
mercado
and
judge
fee's
opinion
in
dowling
in
contradiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
basis
for
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
not
citing
mercado?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
not
saying
that
the
law
of
the
dist
--
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
is
the
dowling
law,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
sorry
to
break-in
on
your
argument,
but
when
you
said
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
that
naturally
raised
a
very
important
question
in
my
mind
because
if
you're
right
about
that
then
i
must
reread
mercado
and
get
a
different
understanding
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
remember
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
mercado.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
were
stating
when
i
interrupted
perhaps
very
unwisely,
you
were
giving
the
list
of
districts
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
which
the
--
the
use
of
them
rule
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
local
rule
prevails
and
i
stopped
you,
i'm
sorry.
you
began
with
new
york
and
naturally
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
affirming
to
the
order
that
was
--
that
is
under
challenge
here,
what
is
that
exactly
that
was
ordered
and
that
was
stricken
down
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
twenty
six?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
i
just
want
to
–
what
page
reference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
15,
fifteen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
--
and
you
say
we
can
--
are
you
asking
us
merely
to
decide
whether
they
can
be
required
to
appear
before
whomever
--
to
appear
before
to
be
asked
these
questions
and
that
--
that
wouldn't
imply
anything
as
to
the
use
to
be
made
thereafter,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
you're
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
say
i
(inaudible)
the
extensive
had
set
me
much
more
recent
experience.
it
does
strike
me
as
--
i
merely
have
to
say
that
deciding
this
case
can
we
have
this
fellow
put
through
all
this
testimony
and
i'm
not
to
imply
anything,
anything
that
used
to
be
made
of
it.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
rather
mutilated
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you
are
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
one
of
the
positions,
you
want
to
name
them
down
so
that
you
can
rely
in
the
courtroom,
you
can
say
--
didn't
you
say
that
and
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
one
of
the
most
important
things
about
pretrial
discovery.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
forgetting
his
memory,
all
sorts
of
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
it
is
more
important
that
in
two
years
later,
he
testified
to
the
contrary
or
is
uncertain,
that
you
want
to
refresh
his
recollection,
bring
him
back
to
what
he
testified
two
years
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
you
--
all
i'm
saying,
like
justice
whittaker,
i'm
entirely
--
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
and
i
don't
suppose
any
other
man
in
this
court
wants
to
be
convinced
that
pretrial
discovery
is
important
in
litigation.
you
don't
have
to
argue
that
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
do
say
that
--
that
it's
an
important
tool
also
to
keep
a
lie
contemporaneous
memory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
need
anything
to
be
against
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
that
here
is
judge
clark,
who
wrote
an
opinion
even
though
it
doesn't
go
as
far
as
one
that
assumes
from
reading,
he
does
go
at
great
length
and
with
great
particularly
to
his
great
regret
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
great
significance
that
this
rule
of
the
civil
procedure,
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
was
significantly
omitted
when
it
did
deal
with
cognitive
rules
which
it
included.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
use
it
as
part
of
your
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
you
can
destroy
the
other
fellow
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
--
the
other
fellow
offers
then
as
a
witness.
don't
you
take
a
lot
of
depositions
of
people
who
never
appear
at
trial
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
claim
here
is
really
for
a
decision
like
judge
fee
in
the
dowling
case,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
dowling
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
they
have
a
rule
in
pennsylvania?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
any
of
it,
what
you
want
is
what
he
directed,
the
witness
there
said
if
used
to
be
sworn.
if
there
is
to
be
sworn
because
he
said,
“you
have
no
power
to
direct
or
to
secure
pretrial
testimonies”,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
derived
it
from
the
body
of
admiralty
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
must
be
so
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
it
depends
on
the
local
--
has
power
to
make
local
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you
have
--
in
order
to
prevail
on
that,
you
have
to
meet
the
question
that
justice
whittaker
put,
namely,
that
since
this
court
issued
rules
of
continental
relevance,
the
continental
--
the
continental
uniformity
and
dealt
with
some
aspects
of
the
civil
rules
of
procedure
and
let
this
out,
it
didn't
mean
that
district
courts
have
a
jacobs
pattern
under
rule
in
one
state
and
another
and
another.
the
fact
that
now
it
so
happened
that
several
are
very
much
alike,
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
because
as
justice
black
pointed
out
they
bear
in
the
issue
they
make
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you're
right
about
this.
i
don't
see
why
you
haven't
--
you
wouldn't
be
right
when
you
come
here
next
time
and
say
you
can
use
it
as
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
my
mind
is
so
confident
that
i
wouldn't
have
to
jump
very
far
from
saying
i
don't
need
a
statute
for
the
second
any
more
than
for
the
first.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
those
are
lower
court
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
lower
court
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
are
lower
court
cases
against
your
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
admiralty
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
in
recalling
that
the
admiralty
bar
in
its
organized
form
was
divided
on
this
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
date,
the
date.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suspect
the
documents
are
in
the
possession
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
isn't
whether
we've
done
it.
it
is
a
quite
question
is
whether
it
is
forbidden
to
the
district
courts
to
do
it,
in
lieu
of
this
court
having
explicitly
authorizing
it,
a
manifest
statement
of
the
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
there
--
you
said
you
would
agree
that
there
are
rules
which
district
courts
may
promulgate
for
the
conduct
of
admiralty
litigation
that
clearly
would
not
be
in
conflict
with
the
promulgated
admiralty
rules
of
this
country
of
1939.
and
then
the
question
is,
is
this
one
of
those
or
is
it
--
i
didn't
mean
to
imply,
if
i
said
anything
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
(inaudible)
question
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
up
to
1913
that
was
substantially
the
course
of
procedure
in
equity
suits
until
oral
testimony
was
introduced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
couldn't
get
the
text
of
the
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
couldn't
get
the
text
of
the
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
effect
now,
mr.
hayes?
you
got
it
back?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
said
louisiana
and
you
explicitly
said
it's
not
the
rule
in
new
orleans.
justice
felix
frankfurter
louisiana
that
excludes
louis
--
new
orleans
is
rather
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
court
is
that,
mr.
hayes?
