i
don't
want
to
delay
it,
but
who
conducted
the
grand
jury?
justice
hugo

black
and
you.
were
you
there
when
the
evidence
was
taken
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
during
the
entire
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice

then
who
--
was
--
was
the
stenographer,
the
regular
court's
stenographer
or
grand
jury
stenographer?
justice

why
did
he
sit
in
the
grand

room
with
reference
to
your

across
the
table,
did
you
have
a
table?
justice

black
you
have
--
justice

black
like
a
grand
jury
room,
usually
as
there
was
a
table,
the
grand
jurors
were
on
both
side
of
the

justice

black
did
you
sit
at
the
end
or
on
the
side
of
the
--
justice
hugo

black
but
the
other
man
sat
right
across

justice

black
court
reporter?
justice

black
mr.
wilkey,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
disturb
you
but
that
fact
that
disturb
me
most
frankly,
is
the
fact
that
if
all
had
occurred
you
knew
you
had
these
statements
and
that
was
the
reason
you
did
not
have
the
reporter.
you
should
have
forgotten
it,
so
that
you
would
have
made
the
statement
later,
as
you
did
several
times
that
you
had
his
evidence.
well,
if
you
were
sitting
there
in
the
grand
jury
when
he
testified
and
knew
that
you
didn't
take
his
testimony
because
you
had
the
statements.
but
that
--
that's
i
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
under
those
circumstances.
it's
--
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
do
you
now
remember
definitely
that
you
did
not
take
it
that
much
because
you
already
had
the
statement
or
is
that
--
do
you
remember
that
definitely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
--
i
can
understand
that.
how
long
was
it
after
the
time
the
--
this
gentleman
testified
before
the
grand
jury,
until
you
made
the
statement
in
court
that
you
had
the
transcript
of
his
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
man
have
the
kind
reputation
that
has
been
asserted
here
if
he
had
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
volume
are
those
statements,
does
the
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
someone
else
could
get
it
while
you
proceed.
i
don't
want
you
to
take
your
time
for
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
somewhat
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
why
was
the
grand
jury
not
entitled
of
no
--
connection
with
the
charge
against
people?
one
of
the
witnesses,
chief
witnesses
against
them,
had
previously
sworn
falsely
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
against
that
witness
--
against
that
defendant.
why
do
you
say
that
was
not
relevant?
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
was
an
alibi,
but
the
jury
considered
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
believe
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
he
an
important
witness?
how
much
evidence
--
how
many
pages
of
the
testimony
did
he
give?
i
understand
to
say
some
tremendous
number.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
did
that
take?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
was
a
very
important
witness,
i
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
--
i'm
asking
that
question
for
this
reason.
i
had
suppose
that
it
was
as
much
the
duty
of
a
prosecuting
attorney
to
protect
the
defendant
against
bad
evidence,
as
it
was
to
bring
out
evidence
against
him.
do
you
agree
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
the
grand
jury
not
entitled
to
that
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
man
was
this
person
that
--
drawn
personally
against
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
was
not
relevant.
and
the
standpoint
maybe
to
this
particular
stand,
but
i
was
just
thinking
about
the
--
i've
always
hold,
that
this
much
a
duty
of
a
prosecuting
attorney
to
protect
the
innocent
as
was
to
convict
the
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
mean
to
say
by
that
innocent
here,
but
i
--
i
mean
introducing
evidence
that
--
against
a
man
from
an
important
witness
and
that
was
known
to
be
would
--
would
reflect
on
his
credibility
for
this
severeness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
i
just
understood
you
--
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
say,
you
knew
at
the
time
you
brought
it
before
the
grand
jury
that
he
had
made
these
false
statements
against
one
of
these
defendants.
and
if
you
did
not
think
that
was
relevant
for
you
to
put
in
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
does
that
make
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

covers
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
if
they
had
not
sent
out
bill
for
the
taxes
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
you
based
wholly
on
the
fact
that
they
used
the
mail
to
send
out
legitimate
tax
bill?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
--
is
there
any
evidence
that
--
or
charge
they
were
illegitimate
tax
bill?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
that
evidence
in
that
regard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
count
is
that
and
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
to
be
sure
that
i
understand.
i'm
not
sure
that
yet
i
do
understand.
are
you
saying
that
a
county's
tax
collector,
who
sends
out
bills
for
taxes
each
year
and
who
for
five
years,
after
that
money
comes
in
and
steals
it
systematically,
or
embezzled
it,
can
be
tried
for
violating
the
mail
fraud
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'm
talking
about
--
the
only
part
of
it
is
operated
through
the
mails,
as
i
asked
you.
is
that
the
tax
collector
sends
out
bills
i'd
get
them
and
i
suppose
you
do,
for
taxes
that
are
due?
that's
all
he
does,
that's
the
only
way
he
uses
the
mail,
but
for
five
years
he
--
he
continuously
pilfers
money
that
should
be
--
go
--
go
to
the
governing
bodies,
are
you
saying
that
under
those
circumstances,
that's
a
violation
of
the
mail
fraud
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
--
i
am
conceiving
that
the
man
has
the
right
to
mail
tax
bills.
tax
collector
has,
he
does
it
all
the
time
and
nothing
wrong
about
it.
the
bills
are
all
100%
right.
they
hold
the
money.
they
send
it
in.
that's
the
only
you
see
--
you'd
make
of
the
mail.
but
for
a
period
of
years,
he's
just
a
little
--
he's
thief
that
steals
--
in
along
--
during
that
time.
i
can
understand
how
he'd
be
guilty
of
theft,
of
course,
embezzlement.
if
your
claim
as
i
understand
it
and
you
have
to
depend
on
that
that
would
also
make
him
liable
for
violating
the
mail
fraud
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
a
bookkeeper,
one
of
the
big
department
stores
here,
sends
out
bills
constantly
for
the
store,
send
them
out
each
month.
they'll
--
they'll
pay
legitimate,
honest
bills
and
that
bookkeeper,
during
that
time,
is
stealing
from
the
employer,
the
department
store.
under
your
statement,
he
would
be
guilty
of
not
merely
of
theft
and
embezzlement
locally,
but
would
also
be
guilty
of
violating
the
mail
fraud
statutes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why,
he
does
it
five
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
the
time,
he's
sending
out
the
bill.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
well,
suppose
it
was
the
manager
of
the
store?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
the
manager,
who
sends
out
the
bill
is
perfectly
ligitimate,
and
--
through
the
mail
--
and
stealing
from
his
company,
would
be
guilty
of
violating
a
mail
fraud
statute,
in
addition
to
theft
and
embezzlement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
your
case
depends
on
here,
isn't
it?
or
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
any
mail
--
does
there
any
mail
fraud
--
any
--
any
use
of
the
mail
here
for
any
purpose
except
to
collect
bills,
any
of
that,
or
anything
else,
except
to
collect
bills?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
--
are
there
any
bill
--
are
you
claiming
that
there
any
of
those
bills
were
illegitimate
bills?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
--
in
what
respect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
they
send
them
bill?
justice
hugo
l.
black
through
the
mail?
justice
hugo
l.
black
through
the
mail?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
are
depending
on
--
you
say
now,
as
i
understand
it
that
introduces
to
the
fact
although
i
haven't
--
hadn't
understood
you
rely
--
you
say
that
they
sent
out
bills
to
people
that
didn't
know
them?
justice
hugo

black
they
owed
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
understand
that.
that
you
did,
goes
on
the
idea
that
they
sent
out
legitimate
bill
and
they
intended
at
that
time
hoped

hoped
to
and
did
succeed
in
stealing
money

it

in.

part?
justice

black
now,
mr.
wilkey,
you
presented
the
--
the
last
two,
three
minutes,
you
presented
the
case
which
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
is
entirely
different
to
the
case
you
heretofore
presented.
where
did
the
court
charged
the
jury
along
the
line
that
you
have
suggested
and
why
is
it
not
in
your
brief?
justice

is
it?

where

where
was

justice
hugo

black
well,
if
that's
the
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
quite
a
different
thing
from
what
you
argued
a
while
ago,
the
assessment
goes
up,
the
assessment
goes
up
frequently.
the
tax
collector
raises
the
assessment
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
tax
assessor
raises
the
assessment.
i
understood
you
that
the
last
to
be
said,
that
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
percentage
of
legitimate
tax
that
these
people
owed.
and
that
the
bills
were
sent
out
for
that
plus
something
over
the
tax
as
fixed
by
law.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
challenging
the
law
of
texas
as
unconstitutional
or
the
way
they
fix
the
taxes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
now,
as
i
gather,
and
maybe
that's
the
cost
of
this.
as
i
understand
it,
what
you're
saying
is
these
people
are
charged
with
the
duty
of
setting
assessments.
and
that
they
set
it
too
high
in
order
that
they
can
collect
more.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
set
it
contrary
to
the
law
of
texas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
send
out
a
single
bill
that
was
more
than
the
law
of
texas
made
legal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
who
had
control.
the
tax
assessor
and
tax
collector
have
control.
are
you
charging
that
they
used
their
power
to
tax
in
a
way
that
you
can
take
it
here
collaborative
to
show
that
they
raised
the
tax
too
high
in
order
to
collect
money
fraudulently?
justice

you're
--

collaterally
attacking

you're
collaterally

the
tax
assessment.

you
can.
justice

black
when
we
get
through,
when
you
have
time,
would
you
send
us
references

the

it
show
us,

that
we
can
see
that
the

was

were
submitted

that

higher
than
they

they
get
money
for
themselves.
