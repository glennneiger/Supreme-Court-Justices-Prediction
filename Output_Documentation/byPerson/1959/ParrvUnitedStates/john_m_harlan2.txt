i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question.
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question
out
of
curiosity,
for
having
you
here
or
a
wide
territory.
i
notice
in
the
record
that
you
were
called
to
the
witness
stand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
issue
do
you
call
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
don't
be,
is
it
printed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
put
a
question
to
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
haven't
read
this
record
so
this
is
highly
hypothetical.
supposing
there
have
been
direct
proof
in
the
case
that
one
of
these
defendants,
the
first
meeting
with
the
school
district
board
and
said;
gentlemen
we
got
an
easy
way
of
making
$40,000
a
year,
we
have
these
tax
receipts
coming
in,
regularly
by
mail
each
month
and
the
procedure
are
to
be
agree
to,
thus
and
so,
and
in
the
outlining
of
this
scheme
which
described
by
mr.
fortas
had
followed.
would
that
be
indictable
offense
under
the
mail
fraud
statute
in
your
view?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
before
or
after
the
main
difference.
beginning
of
the
school
year
that
the
chairman
of
the
board
calls
the
group
together
and
he
said,
â€œwe're
going
to
find
way
of
making
$40,000
a
year
a
piece.
the
assessments
go
out
by
mail,
checks
come
in
by
mail,
regular
source
of
income.
we'll
cash
$40,000
of
these
fictitious
checks
as
they
come
in
each
year
--
each
--
each
year.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that.
and
my
purpose
--
what
i
had
to
say
by
saying
that
this
is
purely
hypothetical,
but
i
want
to
get
your
theory
of
what
this
mail
--
mail
fraud
statute
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
now,
isn't
--
what
it
doesn't.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
do?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
that
isn't
part
of
my
question.
justice
john
m.
