mr.
fortas,
may
i
ask
you
please.
i'm
intrigued
by
your
hypothetical
about
the
doctor's
secretary
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
who
takes
money
from
the
till.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
she
there
sent
out
bills
that
were
regular
and
honest
bills.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
view,
if
with
design
to
appropriate
the
fund
--
if
the
money
came
back,
she
added
on
10%?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
the
court
of
appeals
proceed,
in
your
view,
on
the
basis
that
the
evidence
here
established
an
increase
in
assessed
valuations
for
the
purposes
of
the
bringing
in
an
amount
in
excess
of
need
in
order
to
supply
appeal
for
loot?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
no
evidence
and
no
charge
on
that.

can
i
ask

please,
had
both

statements
been
made
before

justice
charles

and
you
did
testify
before
the
grand
jury
in
1954?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
both
the
statements
were
maybe
prior
to
that
time
and
then
exist
as
to
that
