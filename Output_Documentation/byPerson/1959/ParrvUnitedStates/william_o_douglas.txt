justice
william
o.
douglas
are
you
the
wilkey
at
the
trial?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
--
i've
been
greatly
puzzled.
i'm
greatly
disturbed
i
might
say
that
to
read
it
over
it
again,
statements
that
i
have
these
in
my
possession.
and
then
to
have
government
from
the
case
get
serious
say
well,
that
was
as
an
error.
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
--
how
can
that
be
explained?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
you
did
--
you
did.
you're
the
one
that
did
say
over
again
that
i
have
them
in
my
possession,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
were
--
were
those
at
any
time
in
existence?
justice
william
o.
douglas
were
they
--
were
they
in
--
in
existence,
but
destroyed
or
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
do
you
happen
to
take
the
testimony
of
some
witnesses
not
testimony
of
other
witnesses
before
a
grand
jury?
i
do
not
understand
not
taking
any
witness'
testimony,
but
i
don't
--
i
never
heard
of
it
on
a
selective
basis.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
there
nothing
in
there
about
bloating
the
--
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
assessments,
so
that,
you
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
you
said
that
was
just
in
the
cases.
