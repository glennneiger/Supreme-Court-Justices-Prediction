states.
mr.
fortas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
district
court
told
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr
wilkey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
wilkey,
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask
if
the
time
that
he
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
in
this
case,
had
he
made
those
two
conflicting
affidavits
one
of
which
was
admittedly
false?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
going
to
--
i
was
going
to
ask
you
this,
if
you
had
a
--
have
a
witness
that
you're
going
to
rely
on
at
a
trial
and
you
find
that
that
witness
in
the
same
proceeding
or
collateral
proceedings
has
made
two
affidavits,
so
the
facts
one
of
which
is
admittedly
false,
is
it
not
common
prudence
to
--
to
have
his
testimony
at
the
grand
jury
recorded
so
you
will
--
you
will
have
something,
at
least,
for
yourself
to
rely
on,
if
you
have
to
impeach
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no.
not
in
that
in
that
proceeding.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
this
--
this
you're
indicting
--
you're
indicting
some
people
in
this
proceeding
and
you
are
taking
the
testimony
of
an
important
witness
and
you
know
that
in
the
same
subject
matter,
he
has
made
two
affidavits,
one
which,
he
admits
to
be
false.
do
you
not
think
for
the
protection
of
the
government,
they
are
leaving
the
defendants
aside
that
it
is
prudence
to
record
the
testimony
of
that
man
so
you'll
know,
have
something
that
you
can
impeach
him
on
in
that
particular
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
wilkey,
when
he
was
on
the
stand
then,
he
didn't
stand
on
his
second
affidavit.
he
repudiated
the
second
affidavit
and
went
back
to
the
first
affidavit
and
reaffirmed
the
truth
of
that,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
testify
that
way
for
a
grand
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
he
twice
repudiated
his
testimony
though,
in
his
second
affidavit,
he
repudiated
the
first
affidavit
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
--
and
on
the
--
on
his
testimony
at
the
trial,
he
repudiated
the
second
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
t
a
repudiation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
all
i
ask.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wilkey,
at
the
time
that
he
testified
before
the
grand
jury,
did
you
have
any
understanding
with
him
that
if
he
did
testify,
he
would
not
be
prosecuted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
--
then
was
there
any
explanation
to
the
grand
jury
or
any
suggestion
to
the
grand
jury
that
he
be
not
indicted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
grand
jury
declined
to
indict
heras,
is
that
what
you
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
did
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
did
the
grand
jury
know
--
did
the
grand
jury
know
that
he
had
made
these
false
affidavits
before
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
two
we've
been
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
now,
when
he
testified
in
the
grand
jury,
you
say
he
testified
the
same
as
he
testified
in
court.
now,
if
that
--
if
that
is
true,
why
wouldn't
you
call
the
attention
of
the
grand
jury
to
the
fact
that
he
was
repudiated
--
he
had
first
repudiated
one
affidavit
and
was
at
that
particular
time
repudiating
the
second,
if
you
wanted
the
grand
jury
to
rely
on
--
on
his
testimony
to
indict
these
other
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
see
any
reason
why
he
should
not
be
indicted
when
the
others
were?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
was
the
reason?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
everything
he
had
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
did
name
him
in
the
indictment
as
one
of
the
conspirators.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
--
did
you
distinguish
between
the
time
he
was
in
and
--
and
the
time
his
is
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
indictment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
mean
in
the
indictment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
you
alleged
that
he
was
a
conspirator
between
such
and
such
dates,
the
same
dates
that
you
--
that
you
--
you
alleged
the
defendants
were
in
a
conspiracy,
did
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
that
he
was
member
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
a
few
moments
ago
that
you
prepared
the
indictment
with
heras
in
it,
but
the
grand
jury
did
not
indict
and
they
--
they
returned
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
i'm
wrong
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
used
him
as
a
witness.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
heras
adjure
the
conspiracy
or
did
--
or
did
you
just
not
have
enough
--
have
recent
acts
on
his
part?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
may
--
they
held
that
on
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wilkey
would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
the
distinction
is
between
this
case
and
the
hypothetical
case
that
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
fortas
--
mr.
fortas
made.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
it's
important
that
we
get
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
that
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
--
suppose
i
--
i
change
his
hypothetical
case
just
a
little
and
suppose
there
were
two
girls
in
that
doctor's
office
and
they
said,
“well,
we'll
induce
more
people
to
--
to
pay
money
into
the
cash
by
cash
than
by
--
than
by
check.
so
we'll
have
more
money,
a
--
a
larger
fund
to
steal
from
and
we'll
steal
from
--
from
that.”
so
they
induced
people
to
--
to
pay
in
--
in
cash
rather
by
--
rather
than
by
check.
and
then
the
two
of
them
exploit
that
--
that
fund,
would
that
change
the
situation
in
any?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
now,
would
that
be
mail
fraud?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
just
changed
his
--
his
case
by
saying
that
they
induced
people
to
put
more
money
into
the
--
into
the
cash
funds
instead
of
paying
it
by
check,
it
came
through
the
mails.
and
--
but
some
of
the
checks
did
come
through
the
mails
and
they
--
those
they
turned
into
the
--
into
the
doctor.
but
--
but
the
rest
of
it,
they
kept
for
them
--
kept
them
for
themselves,
so
this
fraudulent
scheme
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
will
that
--
will
that
be
a
mail
fraud?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
don't
need
the
whole
brief
and
others.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
don't
need
the
whole
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
mr.
sharpe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
mr.
sharpe,
you
may
--
you
may
respond
if
you
wish
to
the
memorandum
that
counsel
is
going
to
--
to
furnish
for
justices
black
and
frankfurter.
