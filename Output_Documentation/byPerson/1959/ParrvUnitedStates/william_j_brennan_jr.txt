well,
mr.
fortas,
is
there
anything
that
the
budget
for
the
school
district
was
bloated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
the
taxes
are
raised
against
annual
requirements
for
school
purposes
on
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
well
is
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
the
kind
of
system
where
the
rate
is
determined
by
dividing
requirements
by
rateables?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
change
to
see
its
established
requirements.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
fixed
rate
by
state
laws?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
what
determine
it,
whether
they
--
whether
they
assessed
the
maximum
or
at
some
lower
rate
requirements?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
i
take
it
as
there
where
any
evidence
and
requirements
would
inflate
it,
for
the
purpose
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
applying
the
maximum
rate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
circumstance,
would
you
say
that
the
mails
then
had
been
used?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
trouble
for
the
volume
in
which
the
indictment
is
set
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
subject
matter,
mr.
wikey,
of
the
conflict
--
and
that
you
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wel,
mr.
wilkey,
you
said
--
we
said
that
we
had
here
something
like
the
doctor's
secretary
adding
$5
to
everyone
of
the
bills,
getting
a
check
$5
more
than
the
patient
owed
and
then
cashing
the
checks
and
then
taking
the
$5
do
--
is
that
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
that?
there
have
to
be
bloat
in
every
tax
bills
that
went
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
telling
us
this
that
when
they
manipulated
the
tax
bill,
they
immediately
divided
it
without
regard
the
requirements
except
to
be
sure
that
they
got
something
above
requirements
in
the
way
of
tax
receipts.
if
$2.50
would've
raise
requirements,
they
fix
the
rate
of
$3,
so
that
they
get
more
than
the
requirement,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
i
just
want
to
get
clearly
what
the
government's
theory
was
that
they
didn't
need
the
raise
if
the
rate
--
the
additional
25
cents
for
the
purpose
of
covering
requirements
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
they
didn't
raise
it
for
the
purpose
of
giving
in
the
surplus
which
they
could
steal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
instead
(inaudible)
mr.
wilkey,
we
don't
have
anything
here
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
thousand
pages
do
we
have?
