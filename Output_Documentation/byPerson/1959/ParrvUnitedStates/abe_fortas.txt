mr.
abe
fortas
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
these
convictions
of
the
petitioners
on
the
various
counts
of
an
indictment,
19
counts
of
which,
charged
violations
of
the
federal
mail
fraud
statute
and
the
20th
count
of
which
charged
the
violation
of
the
conspiracy
statute.
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
two
questions,
first,
whether
the
mail
fraud
statute
is
applicable
in
--
to
this
indictment
and
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
second,
whether
the
defendants
should
have
been
granted
access
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
one
of
the
witnesses
at
the
trial,
diego
heras.
in
addition,
due
to
impart
to
developments
after
petitioners
have
filed
their
petition
for
a
certiorari
with
this
court
and
after
the
solicitor
general
had
filed
his
brief
in
our
position
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
manner
had
been
submitted
to
this
court
because
of
events
happening
thereafter,
to
which
i
shall
elude.
in
our
brief,
we
have
suggested
that
the
court
considered
whether
this
case
is
suitable
for
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
power
and
whether
the
case
calls
for
the
exercise
by
this
court
of
its
supervisory
power
over
the
administration
of
the
federal
criminal
process.
now,
with
the
court's
kind
indulgence,
i
shall
commence
with
a
discussion
of
the
mail
fraud
point,
which
in
our
submission
will
dispose
of
the
case
and
in
our
submission
should
result
in
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
before
doing
that,
i
should
like
very
briefly
to
give
the
court,
if
i
may,
an
idea
of
our
point
with
respect
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
question
and
a
very
brief
idea
of
the
reason
why
we
have
respectfully
suggested
consideration
of
the
invocation
and
use
in
this
case
of
this
court's
supervisory
power.
i
shall
then
go
to
the
mail
fraud
point
and
shall
then
return
to
the
grand
jury
and
the
supervisory
power
points.
on
the
grand
jury
point,
the
witness,
diego
heras,
was
in
our
submission,
the
government's
principal
witness,
the
government
disputes
that.
his
testimony
occupied
23%
of
the
record
below
about
1000
pages
out
of
about
6000
pages.
the
court
instructed
the
jury
below
that
they
might
convict
on
the
testimony
--
on
the
unsupported
testimony
of
an
accomplice.
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
diego
heras
was
an
accomplice.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
diego
heras'
testimony
contained
many
inconsistencies
and
contradictions
and
it's
said
that
the
jury
might
have
considered
him
far
from
trust
--
trustworthy,
as
we
argue
in
our
briefs,
those
are
mild
and
gentle
words.
mr.
abe
fortas
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
your
honor.
now,
subsequent
as
i
said,
after
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
government's
brief
had
been
submitted
to
this
court,
the
solicitor
general
filed
a
memorandum
in
this
court
saying
in
fact,
“oops,
we're
very
sorry.
there
is
no
transcript
of
diego
heras'
testimony
before
the
grand
jury.
his
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
was
never
recorded.”
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
distinguished
prosecuting
attorney,
in
the
case
in
the
district
court,
mr.
wilkey
who
was
then
united
states
attorney
in
houston.
mr.
wilkey
had
stated
trice
in
the
trial
court,
in
response
to
inquiry
that
there
was
a
transcript
of
mr.
heras'
testimony
and
there
are
yards
of
words
that
were
spelled
in
the
district
court
and
miles
of
words
that
were
debated
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
assumption
and
the
case
was
litigated
by
the
--
by
the
defense
on
that
basis.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
he
said,
“i
have
the
transcript
and
it
is
in
my
office.”
mr.
abe
fortas
your
honor,
there
is
no
doubt
i
believe.
perhaps
mr.
wilkey
will
agree.
i
believe
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
court
was
asking
him,
“do
you
have
a
transcript
of
mr.
heras'
testimony
before
this
grand
jury?”
and
that
mr.
wilkey
said,
“i
do.”
when
he
was
asked
that
question
on
two
additional
times,
mr.
wilkey
said
he
has
it
in
his
office.
now,
we
as
--
say
as
i
hope
to
show
in
a
few
minutes
that
this
is
a
case
that
falls
within
the
--
this
court's
doctrine
as
laid
down
in
procter
&
gamble
and
pittsburgh
plate
glass,
that
this
was
a
case
of
ultimate
and
absolute
need
because
of
the
critical
nature
of
heras'
testimony
and
because
of
his
demonstrated
unreliability
and
because
he
was
a
witness
beholding
to
the
government.
now,
i
feel
it
necessary
again
as
i
profess
here
to
state
why
we
have
suggested
that
this
court
consider
whether
this
case
is
appropriate
for
invocation
of
its
supervisory
power.
in
the
first
place,
if
the
solicitor
general's
statement
is
accepted
that
mr.
heras
was
examined
before
the
grand
jury
in
this
case
and
his
testimony
was
not
reported,
we
believe
that
that
calls
for
an
exercise
of
this
court's
supervisory
power.
we
do
not
contend
that
under
the
rules,
it
is
necessary
as
a
matter
of
law
for
the
testimony
of
every
witness
before
a
federal
grand
jury
in
texas
to
be
reported.
we
do
contend
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
it
was
an
abuse
not
to
record
the
testimony
of
heras
as
an
example
and
now
come
to
others.
the
government
knew
at
the
time
that
heras
was
put
on
the
--
on
the
stand
before
the
grand
jury
that
he
had
given
an
affidavit,
sworn
affidavit
to
the
fbi
concerning
the
petition
of
parr,
that
he
had
subsequently,
given
a
contradictory
affidavit
to
the
fbi
on
the
same
matter
in
which
he
had
said
that
he
had
not
told
the
truth
in
his
first
affidavit.
the
government
knew
and
mr.
heras
had
not
been
prosecuted
as
part
of
this
great
kettle
of
fish
involved
in
this
part
of
texas.
the
government
knew
that
mr.
heras
was
dependent
upon
the
government's
mercy.
every
other
important
witness
called
before
the
grand
jury,
i
think
there
were
over
75,
the
testimony
of
all
except
four
of
the
witnesses
called
before
that
grand
jury
was
reported.
of
the
other
--
of
this
four,
one
was
heras,
then
the
--
there
was
another
one
who
was
the
--
a
postal
inspector
and
there
were
two
people
who
were
not
witnesses
at
the
trial.
all
the
others
were
transcribed.
the
grand
jury
proceedings
took
place
over
a
long
period
of
time.
mr.
abe
fortas
your
honor,
i
--
can
i
--
mr.
abe
fortas
your
honor,
all
i
--
i
know
about
this
is
what
is
in
the
papers
as
to
the
reasons
for
it.
and
the
government's
brief
says
that
the
reason
that
mr.
heras'
testimony
was
not
recorded,
was
first
that
it
was
well
known
to
the
government
so
they
did
not
mean
a
recommendation
of
it
for
their
own
use
at
the
trial.
and
second,
that
he
was
brought
in
at
the
last
day
when
the
case
was
fully
developed.
now,
that
second
reason,
i
find
singularly
unpersuasive,
because
heras
was
such
an
important
and
a
key
witness
and
to
his
suspicious
mind
and
i
suspect
that
i,
as
an
advocate,
must
have
one
and
who
have
one,
then
maybe
other
reasons
for
the
government's
having
delayed
and
delayed
in
bringing
heras
in
as
a
witness
before
that
grand
jury
and
then
finally
bringing
him
in
on
the
last
day.
but
i
am
not
--
i
can't
suggest
any
--
what
--
what
the
--
what
was
in
the
government's
mind
beyond
what
in
its
papers,
i
do
submit,
mr.
justice.
mr.
abe
fortas
it
may
your
honor.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes.
mr.
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
mr.
abe
fortas
yes.
i
should
not
--
mr.
abe
fortas
well,
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
make
two
points
to
that,
mr.
justice.
first,
i
want
to
say
that
this
grand
jury
proceeding
was
prior
to
the
jencks
case
and
prior
to
the
rush
of
interest
that
has
since
developed
in
a
--
by
--
on
a
private
defendant
in
obtaining
grand
jury
transcripts,
i
think
that
is
an
important
point
for
the
prosecuting
attorney
on
his
side.
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor,
my
point
is
that
regardless
of
whether
there
were
or
were
not
sharp
motives,
that
responsible
prosecution
in
the
particular
circumstances
of
mr.
heras,
would
certainly
have
caused
the
prosecuting
attorney
to
see
that
his
testimony
was
recorded,
the
testimony
of
over
70
witnesses
before
that
grand
jury
on
this
same
manner
were
reported.
heras
was
a
self-confessed
liar,
thief,
embezzler,
who
had
given
the
government
a
false
affidavit.
certainly,
the
minimum
of
prudence,
the
minimum
of
proper
procedure,
in
my
submission,
your
honor,
would
have
meant
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
would
say
in
the
case
of
this
witness,
“above
all,
we
will
have
a
record
because
it
is
my
duty
to
see
that
this
man
who
has
perjured,
who
has
falsely
testified
before
does
not
perjure
himself
before
the
grand
jury.
and
it
is
my
duty
to
see
that
the
innovations
that
are
necessarily
attended
upon
the
presence
of
a
report
and
the
taking
down
of
a
witness'
testimony
are
operative
in
this
--
in
this
situation.”
mr.
abe
fortas
i
certainly
am
your
honor,
which
is
different
from
motive.
i
may
have
misunderstood
you,
but
i
--
i'm
not
suggesting
sharp
practice
or
anything
about
the
prosecuting
attorney's
motive,
but
i
certainly
am
suggesting
that
dereliction
of
duty
as
--
mr.
abe
fortas
yes.
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
while
the
trial
was
going
on,
this
court's
decision
in
jencks
came
down
and
then
the
defendants
were
furnished
with
a
large
batch
of
statements
by
heras
and
other
witnesses
and
we
have
the
affidavits
--
mr.
abe
fortas
--
now
in
the
record,
here.
mr.
abe
fortas
upon
request,
as
i
--
yes,
that
is
correct,
upon
request.
well
now,
i
should
like
to
get
to
the
mail
fraud
point
here.
the
government
agrees
that
the
mail
fraud
situation
here
presents
a
“unique
situation,”
that
is
in
quote.
they
say
that
there
is
no
case
exactly
like
this.
it
is
our
submission
to
your
honors
that
the
attempt
to
use
the
mail
fraud
statute
in
this
case
is
not
only
unprecedented,
but
it's
contrary
to
the
law
and
that
the
result
of
the
use
of
the
mail
fraud
statute
in
this
case,
if
it
is
sustained,
would
be
to
expand
federal
jurisdiction
over
whether
are
in
substance
local
crimes,
to
an
extent
which
would
leave
very
little
outside
of
the
scope
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
terms
of
the
--
the
heretofore
local
crimes
of
embezzlement.
now,
i'll
have
to
just
lay
the
facts
out
as
briefly
as
i
can,
your
honors.
the
event
in
this
case
involved
the
benavides
independent
school
district,
which
is
located
on
the
corpus
christi
division
of
the
southern
district
of
texas.
this
school
district
had
to
duty,
under
the
law,
to
operate
two
schools
and
had
the
power
and
the
duty
to
levy
and
collect
taxes
on
property
located
in
the
district
for
the
purpose
of
raising
funds
for
school
operations.
now,
there
are
11
petitioners
here,
and
six
of
them
were
officially
connected
with
the
school
district.
one
of
them
was
the
tax
collector
of
the
school
district.
three
of
them
were
on
the
board
of
trustees
and
one
of
them,
for
a
short
period
of
time,
was
the
attorney
for
the
school
district
and
another
was
for
part
of
the
times,
secretary
of
the
school
district,
that's
six
of
them.
the
other
five
were
connected
with
the
fiscal
affairs
of
the
bank
of
the
school
district
in
this
sense.
two
of
the
other
petitioners
are
banks,
one
being
the
official
depository
for
the
school
district,
and
then
the
remaining
three
persons
who
are
the
petitioners
here
including
george
parr,
were
officials
of
the
banks
and
it's
also
alleged
that
mr.
parr
dominated
the
affairs
of
the
school
district
and
there
is
evidence
from
which
a
jury
might
have
drawn
that
conclusion.
now,
the
indictment
herein
and
the
evidence
viewed
most
favorably
to
the
government,
showed
that
some
of
the
petitioners
misappropriated
and
embezzled
funds
of
the
school
district
over
a
period
of
years.
they
--
overpaid
of
approximately
five
years,
there's
some
doubt
as
to
when
the
embezzlement
stood.
now,
the
technique
by
which
the
scheme
to
defraud
the
school
operated
was
this,
checks
were
issued
to
fictitious
persons,
nonexistent
persons
and
checks
were
issued
to
real
persons
for
a
work
that
they
did
not
do
and
the
proceeds
of
those
checks,
the
jury
might
have
found,
were
turned
over
to
the
petitioner,
parr.
now,
this
was
the
scheme,
the
scheme
to
which
attention
was
directing.
these
practices,
as
i
said,
were
indulgent
from
a
period
of
about
five,
perhaps
six
years,
the
indictment
come
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
covers
at
period
september
1,
1951
to
december
1954.
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
magnitude
of
--
of
the
embezzlement
pursuant
to
the
scheme,
a
government
--
the
government
estimates
that
the
fraudulent
checks
which
i've
just
described
in
the
five-year
period
amounted
to
about
$190,000.
now,
because
it
maybe
relevant
later
on,
i'm
going
to
divide
that
by
the
period
of
the
embezzlements
and
suggest
that
mathematically,
the
embezzlements
amounted
to
a
little
over
$40,000
a
year.
because
i
want
you
to
consider
that
if
you
will,
as
against
the
annual
receipt
from
school
tax
assessments
which
--
or
the
annual
school
tax
assessments
in
which
run
from
the
amount
of
$400,000
in
1949
to
$650,000
in
1952.
now,
in
other
words,
this
was
just
a
small
part
of
the
school
tax
assessments
although,
it
was
a
lot
of
money.
mr.
abe
fortas
less
than
that,
i
think,
sir.
in
the
later
--
in
the
years
--
mr.
abe
fortas
--
covered
by
the
indictment,
it
was
substantially
lesser
than
10%.
now,
most
of
these
petitioners
have
been
indicted
in
the
state
courts
for
embezzlement
and
for
these
transactions
that
had
same
transactions
that
it
covered
in
this
indictment.
to
the
present
time,
they
have
all
either
been
acquitted
or
after
conviction,
their
convictions
have
been
reversed
in
the
appellate
courts
of
the
state
of
texas.
there
are
a
number
of
state
criminal
proceedings
still
pending,
however.
now,
i've
just
described
to
you
the
central
scheme.
in
addition
to
this
scheme,
there
is
some
evidence
that
there
were
individuals
among
these
petitioners
and
perhaps
other
persons,
who
engaged
in
sort
of
folics
of
their
own,
petty
grafts,
thievery,
embezzlements.
there
are
--
the
only
ones
that
are
involved
in
this
case
in
that
category
of
this
sort
of
individual
frauds.
the
--
the
only
instances
involved
the
individuals
chapa,
garza
and
oscar
carrillo.
those
are
the
only
individual
cases
in
which
a
mail
fraud
is
alleged,
as
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment,
in
addition
to
the
general
and
pervasive
scheme.
the
government
says
that
chapa,
who
was
the
tax
collector,
took
for
himself
some
of
the
tax
money
belonging
to
the
district,
instead
of
this
operating
as
part
of
the
scheme,
chapa
took
it
for
himself.
the
procedure
which
chapa
used
to
get
this
grant
for
himself
was
different
from
the
scheme
itself.
but
the
net
effect
was
the
same
except
that
chapa
got
the
money.
in
the
general
scheme,
you
will
recall
the
checks,
fictitious
checks,
were
drawn
against
the
general
funds
of
the
district.
in
chapa's
case,
he
being
the
tax
collector,
into
the
two
instances
that
are
involved
in
the
indictment,
he
received
checks
by
mail.
he
then
cashed
the
checks,
as
he
had
a
right
to
do
under
texas
law.
under
texas
law,
it
is
not
the
checks,
but
the
proceeds
of
the
checks
that
belong
to
the
district.
we've
got
that
brief
and
i
shall
pause
course
to
elaborate,
that
is
the
fact.
and
chapa,
instead
of
turning
over
the
cash
proceeds
of
these
checks
to
the
district,
appropriated
them
for
himself.
that's
very
bad.
it
is
not
a
mail
fraud
as
we
show
in
our
brief
and
as
i
think,
i'll
--
as
i
hope
come
too
in
a
moment.
the
other
individual
frolic,
if
it
maybe
called
that,
involves
an
item
that
the
government
itself
in
its
brief
says
is
quite
small
and
that
is
that
two
of
the
people
here,
garza
and
oscar
carrillo
got
--
bought
some
gasoline
for
their
personal
use
instead
of
paying
for
that
of
their
pockets,
they
charged
it
to
the
district.
again,
this
is
no
mail
fraud
violation
as
we
show
in
our
brief,
but
i
want
to
come
in
the
little
time
that
i
have
to
the
central
school,
because
i
am
confident
that
the
case
turns
on
that.
now,
the
essential
point,
your
honors,
is
that
this
indictment
does
not
charge.
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
that
anyone
of
the
fraudulent
checks
drawn
on
the
funds
of
the
district
was
sent
through
the
mails
at
anytime.
it
is
not
those
fraudulent
checks
that
are
claimed
to
be
violations
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
actually,
what
happened
is
that
all
these
people
lived
in
and
around
this
little
town
and
the
fraudulent
checks
were
made
out,
they
were
then
passed
from
hand
to
hand,
passed
over
to
the
bank
and
then
the
proceeds
were
taken
over
by
hand
allegedly,
to
mr.
parr.
so,
the
fraudulent
checks
are
not
charged
as
a
mail
fraud.
well,
held
us,
where
does
the
government
get
a
mail
fraud
in
this
case?
now,
and
here
we
are
right
at
the
nub
of
point.
the
government
says
that
some
of
these
and
some
of
these
petitioners,
the
three
members
of
the
board
and
the
secretary
of
the
board
operating
they
say
under
the
domination
on
this
property,
were
in
charged
of
the
school
district
and
had
functions
with
respect
to
the
collection
of
taxes
for
the
school
district,
you
say.
and
since
some
of
those
taxes
came
in
by
a
mail,
they
say
that
is
a
use
of
the
mails.
now,
i
quote
the
statute
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
fraudulent
scheme.
now,
they
say
that
since
one
of
the
taxes
were
collected
by
mail
since
the
proceeds
of
those
taxes
went
into
the
general
funds
of
the
school,
since
persons
stole
from
the
general
funds
of
the
school,
that
therefore,
the
collection
of
taxes
was
a
use
of
the
mails
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
embezzlements
from
the
fund.
now,
every
time
i
say
that,
it
sounds
a
little
complicated,
but
we
have
suggested
and
i
believe
what
an
important
qualification
the
government
has
been
impressed
by
this.
we
have
suggested
that
the
government's
proposition
here,
as
just
--
is
--
it
is
like
to
follow.
let
us
suppose
that
a
doctor
got
a
secretary
and
the
secretary
sends
bills
out
to
all
the
doctor's
patients
through
the
mail
and
some
of
the
bills
are
paid
by
use
of
the
mails
and
then
the
payments
go
into
the
doctor's
account
and
the
girl
--
the
secretary
has
a
petty
cash
fund,
and
let
us
say
every
week
she
dips
into
the
petty
cash
fund
and
takes
50
cents
or
$5
or
$10.
now,
in
the
government's
theory,
in
this
case,
on
the
theory
of
this
indictment,
most
embezzlements
are
a
violation
of
the
federal
mail
fraud
statute.
mr.
abe
fortas
there
is
--
the
fraud
is
her
--
nothing,
but
her
embezzlement.
i
mean
to
say,
in
the
case
that
i
put
to
you,
she
embezzles
and
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
abe
fortas
not
in
my
opinion.
mr.
abe
fortas
not
--
not
--
mr.
abe
fortas
--
in
connection
with
the
use
of
the
mails.
mr.
abe
fortas
there
were
many
frauds
here,
your
honor.
mr.
abe
fortas
but
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
use
of
the
mails.
mr.
abe
fortas
there
--
well,
there
is
a
fraud,
your
honor
in
the
sense
that
--
mr.
abe
fortas
that's
correct.
mr.
abe
fortas
well,
if
your
honor
please,
it
is
our
--
mr.
abe
fortas
yes.
mr.
abe
fortas
that's
right.
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
i
want
to
make
this
clear,
but
perhaps,
i
--
and
i
say
we
should
have.
there
were
lots
of
frauds
here.
one
of
the
frauds
that
the
government
talks
about
in
great
deal
is
that
reports
were
submitted
to
the
school
board
in
austin,
texas
by
these
petitioners
and
there
were
fraudulent
representations
in
their
report
to
that
school
board,
but
the
report
to
the
school
board
is
not
a
use
of
the
mails.
that
is
relied
on
in
this
case,
it
couldn't
be.
one
of
the
interesting
and
important
things
about
this
case,
one
of
the
things
that
we
call
to
the
court's
attention
in
connection
with
our
supervisory
power
point
is
this,
the
venue
of
this
case,
this
indictment
was
brought
in
houston,
texas
which
is
250
miles
northeast
of
the
benavides
school
district
and
of
the
area
in
which
these
--
the
defendants,
these
petitioners
live.
although
everything
involved
here,
all
the
fraud
involved
here
relates
to
the
benavides
school
district.
it
was
brought
in
houston,
venue
was
placed
in
houston
by
the
device
of
saying
that
the
mailings
had
(inaudible)
in
houston.
what
mailings?
the
mailings
of
--
of
taxes
--
of
checks
and
payment
of
taxes
by
the
humble
oil
company,
the
texas
oil
company
and
so
on,
those
are
the
counts
in
this
indictment
that
i
alleged
to
be
the
mail
frauds.
humble
oil
company
sends
in
a
check
in
payment
of
its
taxes,
that
appears
as
a
mail
fraud
and
the
--
and
the
petitioners
are
alleged
to
have
committed
the
crime
in
houston,
how?
by
causing
humble
oil
company
to
send
in
a
check
in
payment
of
taxes,
how
do
petitioners
cause
him
to
do
it?
petitioners
cause
him
to
do
it
by
assessing
the
taxes
as
they
have
to
do
it
according
to
law.
there
is
not
a
word
in
this
indictment,
if
the
court
please.
there
is
not
a
word
of
evidence,
if
the
court
please.
there
is
nothing
in
trial
court's
charge,
if
the
court
please.
to
the
effect
that
any
of
these
tax
notices
or
that
if
any
of
these
tax
payments
was
itself
tainted
with
fraud,
or
that
the
taxes
where
inflated
or
that
there
was
any
kind
of
monkey
work
in
connection
with
the
taxes.
and
government,
in
it's
final
--
in
it's
brief
here,
as
rather
to
my
mind,
rather
extraordinary
arguments
trying
desperately
at
this
last
moment
to
rewrite
the
indictment
by
suggesting
that
now,
that
there
were,
that
the
taxes
might
have
been
less,
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
scheme
to
defraud.
the
trial
court,
their
position
was
not
that
the
taxes
might've
been
less,
but
that
the
schools
might've
been
better
and
i
suspect
they
might've.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
government
has
taken
--
government
--
so
i
--
i
understand,
did
not
advance
that
field
in
the
courts
below.
the
court
of
appeals
has
--
divides
the
--
and
developed
the
theory
and
the
government
here
elaborates
it
and
we
answer
it
in
our
reply
brief
to
which
i
respectfully
call
the
court's
attention.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
mr.
abe
fortas
the
court
of
appeals
indicates
something
to
that
general
effect
and
the
government
here
elaborates
on
it,
but
more
cautiously.
the
government
here
says
more
cautiously
than
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
taxes
might
well
have
been
lowered,
if
it
had
not
been
forfeits.
our
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
it
is
very
claimed,
if
only
maybe
so
bold
as
to
say
so,
there's
nothing
to
--
to
that
effect
in
the
indictment.
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect.
there
is
nothing
in
the
charge.
that's
not
the
theory
of
this
case.
that
is
no
the
theory
of
this
indictment
or
the
theory
on
which
this
case
was
tried.
the
theory
very
plainly
was
this.
remember,
venue
in
houston,
the
theory
very
plainly
was
that
taxpayers
in
houston
send
in
checks
in
payment
of
taxes
and
the
board
in
benavides
sent
out
a
few
notices
to
people
in
--
in
houston
that
this
tax
collection
process
resulted
in
part,
in
the
creation
of
a
fund,
which
belonged
to
the
school
district.
i
say
in
part,
because
there
were
funds
from
other
sources
too.
and
these
people
embezzled
and
stole
money
from
this
fund.
it's
exactly
like
the
doctor's
case.
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
indictment
to
the
effect
that
the
taxes
that
either
--
that
tax
is
whether
in
the
aggregate
or
in
individual
cases
were
affected
by
this
fraud.
mr.
abe
fortas
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
abe
fortas
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
recall
anything
about
a
budget
here
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
--
mr.
abe
fortas
and
the
fact
of
the
matters
is
that
the
tax
assessing
process
is
composed
of
two
parts.
one
is
the
valuation
of
property,
of
course,
and
the
other
is
fixing
of
the
rates.
so
far
as
the
valuation
process
here
is
concerned,
that
was
done
by
a
board
of
equalization
in
the
--
with
respect
to
government
estimate
75%
to
85%
of
the
property
as
a
matter
of
value
here.
that
was
done.
the
valuation
was
fixed
on
recommendations
of
concededly
independent
engineers.
most
of
the
important
property
in
this
district
is
oil
property
and
humble
oil
and
texas
oil
company
only
and
there
was
a
firm
of
independent
engineers
and
appraisers
who
made
the
valuations
and
turned
it
over
to
the
board
of
equalization,
which
was
separate
from
--
that
is
composed
of
different
people
although
they
may
have
been
nominated
by
the
school
district,
but
they
weren't
the
same
people.
and
there
were
sorts
of
procedural
rights.
the
usual
kind,
taxpayer
didn't
like
it
he
could
apply
for
a
hearing
at
the
board
of
equalization
and
go
--
go
to
the
courts.
so
there's
no
--
no
question
about
the
--
the
valuation
and
no
--
no
such
charge
is
made.
the
second
thing
is
the
level
of
the
rates.
the
rates
here
were
fixed,
the
--
the
maximum
that
could
be
assessed
was
fixed
by
the
--
by
a
state
law
and
of
course,
one
might
argue
that
the
--
the
board
might
have
fixed
the
rates
at
anything
lower
than
that.
at
something
lower
than
the
maximum,
that
would've
been
rather
--
that
would
have
been
--
mr.
abe
fortas
--
precedents
--
mr.
abe
fortas
your
honor,
that's
not
the
way
it
has
worked.
it
is
worked
on
the
basis
of
a
maximum
rate
prescribed
by
the
state
applied
to
the
valuation
of
the
property.
now,
the
record
is
replete
with
evidence.
as
we
construe
it,
that
even
that
systems
did
not
bring
in
what
would've
been
an
adequate
amount
of
money
for
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abe
fortas
i
would
--
mr.
abe
fortas
i
--
it
must've
been
--
it
must've
been
the
school
district,
your
honor.
but
the
tax
--
but
that
is
not
rate
that
the
taxes
were
assessed
here.
they
were
assessed
on
the
basis
of
the
valuation
of
the
length
and
the
rate
was
applied
to
it.
mr.
abe
fortas
it
was
fixed
at
the
maximum.
they
could
go
lower
than
that,
but
they
never
have.
and
they
--
and
so
far
as
the
record
shows
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abe
fortas
i
suppose
so,
your
honor.
mr.
abe
fortas
exactly.
mr.
abe
fortas
exactly.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
would
indeed,
but
the
evidence
is
to
the
precise
contract.
the
evidence
is
replete
and
mr.
wilkey
put
a
lot
of
it
in,
in
the
court.
and
he
argued
it
very
stirringly
to
the
jury
that
this
school
district,
its
facilities,
its
teachers,
its
children
were
in
dire
need
of
additional
revenues.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
either
an
inflation
of
--
of
the
rates,
because
of
the
scheme
or
that
the
total
amount
collected
was
in
excess
of
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
district.
there's
nothing
like
that
in
this
case
which,
your
honor,
in
order
for
it
to
be
a
federal
crime,
of
course,
that
theory
would
have
had
to
be
alleged
in
the
indictment,
too.
you
say
so
that
the
defendants
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
meet
it.
i
point
out
two
things
to
you,
one
that
it
is
not
in
the
indictment
and
two
that
it
is
not
in
the
evidence.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes.
it's
in
the
first
volume,
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
abe
fortas
it's
at
page
--
begins
at
page
10.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
should
like
the
court's
permission
to
reserve
the
remaining
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
and
the
rebuttal
will
be
handled
by
mr.
sharpe,
who
is
on
trial
counsel
of
the
case.
before
sitting
down,
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
reply
brief,
which
we
have
filed,
as
the
appendix
b,
which
we
have
set
forth
in
fact,
similarly
the
specific
mailings,
which
are
charged
as
the
price
in
these
indictment
and
a
glance
that
those,
well,
i
believe
clearly
demonstrate
the
remoteness
of
those
mailings
from
the
frauds.
thank
you.
