mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
should
like
to
say
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
indeed.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
justice
douglas
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
intend
to
explain
that
fully
and
if
you
say
that
you
were
stirred
to
read
that
over
and
to
find
out
that
they
did
not
exist,
that
is
a
mild
statement
as
to
how
i
felt
when
i
found
out
that
the
grand
jury
statement
in
the
court
--
in
the
--
before
the
grand
jury
the
mail
fraud
case
did
not
exist.
i
will
go
into
that
immediately,
first,
but
i
would
like
to
ask
the
chief
justice
to
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
stated
three
times
that
i
had
the
grand
jury
transcript
on
mr.
heras'
testimony
in
my
possession
and
--
in
my
office,
not
in
the
courtroom,
and
i
meant
the
mail
fraud
grand
jury
and
on
the
third
time,
i
specified
that
it
was
the
mail
fraud
grand
jury.
i
was
flatly
in
error
and
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
no,
sir,
never.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
oh,
no.
never
--
never.
and
we
are
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
let
me
assure
you
that
the
selective
basis
was
not
intentional
in
regard
to
not
having
a
transcript
of
the
witness,
heras',
testimony.
let
me
outline,
if
i
may,
the
circumstances
at
the
time
and
the
reasons
why
we
did
not
take
a
transcript
of
the
testimony
before
the
mail
fraud
grand
jury.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
bottler,
my
assistant,
who
is
at
the
table
here
and
i.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
i
was.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
before
the
grand
jury?
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
no.
i
don't
think
before
the
entire
evidence.
we
shared
the
responsibility,
but
i
was
there.
i'm
satisfied
during
the
entire
interrogation
of
heras.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
stenographer
was
one
of
the
regular
court
stenographers,
who
was
either
habitually
or
occasionally
employed
before
the
courts
here
in
the
united
states
courthouse.
whether
he
had
an
appointment
as
official
court
reporter,
i
do
not
know,
but
he
had
that
status
and
we
have
used
him
in
one
of
the
grand
jury,
i
think.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
think,
we
generally
put
the
court
reporter
right
beside
the
witness
where
he
could
hear
the
witness'
testimony
clearly.
and
as
to
where
i
customarily
set
an
interrogation,
i
--
frequently,
i
would
sit
on
the
other
sides
of
the
witness.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
we
have
a
table.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
across
the
table.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
they
were
on
the
both
sides
of
the
table
and
siting
around
the
room.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
--
i
forgot,
sir.
i
could
not
say
exactly
where
i
sat.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
court
reporter,
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that
is
correct.
now,
let
me
explain
and
i
want
to
do
it
at
the
outset
and
i
can
see,
i
know
mr.
justice
douglas'
concern,
but
i
know
that
the
rest
of
the
court
is
concerned.
that's
why
we
made
no
transcript
here
of
the
witness
errors.
we
had
either
12
or
14
statements
of
heras
taken
by
various
investigating
agencies
during
the
past
two
years
of
1950
--
during
1953
and
1954.
we
had
12
or
14
at
that
time
and
we
subsequently
acquired
two
or
three
more.
17
statements
of
heras
were
turned
over
to
the
defense
at
the
trial.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
i
have
the
grand
jury
transcript
recorded
on
mr.
heras,
before
a
grand
jury
which
met
in
october
1954,
concerning
the
affairs
of
mr
george
b.
parr
and
concerning,
in
part
at
least,
these
matters
made
the
subject
to
this
mail
fraud
indictment.
when
the
last
day
came
up
and
there
was
no
particular
reason
why
heras
would
--
there
on
the
last
day,
he
could've
been
earlier.
heras
lived
in
houston
at
that
time
and
--
and
was
available
anytime
that
we
needed
to
call
him.
when
the
last
day
came
up,
we
had
only
two
witnesses
left,
mr.
heras
and
postal
inspector,
mane
(ph).
we
did
not
need
a
court
reporter
and
we
told
the
court
reporter,
his
services
were
not
needed
that
day.
and
there
was
no
transcript
made
of
either
heras
or
inspector
mane.
now,
we
hadn't
made
a
transcript
of
inspector
mane
when
he
appeared
on
the
first
day
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
reason
was
as
in
the
case
of
heras,
mane
was
there
in
houston,
we
had
reports
of
mane,
if
we
wanted
to
ask
any
questions
of
inspector
mane
we
could
have
call
him
up
on
the
telephone
and
ask
him
to
come
down
to
the
federal
building.
we
had
as
i
say
12
or
14
statements
for
heras,
taken
on
these
matters
and
there
was
simply
no
need
to
make
a
transcript.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
you
mean,
i
--
you
--
you
don't
understand
how
i
failed
to
recall?
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
justice
black,
i,
myself,
have
no
independent
recollection,
of
course,
as
to
why
i
made
the
error
in
the
courtroom.
i
assure
you
it
was
a
flat
misstatement,
unintentionally
made
and
i
was
not
aware
that
this
did
not
exist
until
we
ascertained
it
later
on.
and
in
reconstructing
it,
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
must
have
been
thinking
of
the
tax
grand
jury
transcript,
which
i
hold
here
in
my
hand
and
which
we
did
have,
a
record
on
mr.
heras'
testimony
back
in
1954.
now
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
can't
remember
that
definitely
but
by
going
back
as
to
what
happen
in
the
circumstances,
i'm
satisfied
that
that
is
true
and
there
--
that
was
the
reason
we
did
not
record
them.
we
could
have
had
no
other
reason
than
the
fact,
we
simply
didn't
mean
it
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
in
my
two
years
as
united
states
attorney
there,
in
march
1956,
i
had
never
had
a
demand
for
a
grand
jury
transcript
except
in
this
case.
the
jencks
decisions
did
not
come
until
a
year
and
a
quarter
after
this
mail
fraud
grand
jury.
and
it
never
occur
to
--
to
us
--
to
me
that
there
was
any
obligation
on
us
to
make
a
grand
jury
transcript
for
the
benefit
of
the
defendants.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
he
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
on
march
the
6th,
1956.
i
made
the
statement,
i
suppose
the
first
time,
thinking
i
had
the
transcript
on
june
the
5th,
1957,
a
year
and
three
months
later.
and
i
will
call
your
attention
further
that
the
case
has
been
tried
once
before
in
november
and
december
and
that
i
did
not
have
in
the
courtroom,
the
transcripts
and
it
had
been,
i'm
satisfied,
prior
to
the
first
trial
that
i
have
had
occasion
even
to
refer
to
the
grand
jury
transcripts.
by
the
time
of
the
second
trial,
in
trial
preparation,
as
counsel
at
the
table,
i
had
all
of
the
information
on
all
of
the
witnesses,
pretty
well
reduced
to
notes
that
i
could
hold
in
my
hand
and
use
for
examination.
in
some
instances,
in
this
second
case,
i
used
a
transcript
made
from
the
first
trial.
but
in
most
instances,
i
had
(inaudible)
the
thing
down
to
the
very
essentials
that
we
needed
to
present
our
case,
and
since
we
were
doing
it
for
the
second
time,
we
pretty
well
new
what
that
was.
and
so,
i
did
not
refer
to
the
grand
jury
transcript
of
errors
or
any
government
witnesses
and
i
don't
think
i
had
any
occasion
to
do
so,
at
any
time
during
the
trial.
i
have
no
recollection,
but
i
don't
think
there
was
any
reason
for
it.
they
were
all
back
in
the
files
in
the
office.
now,
in
the
files
was
a
grand
jury
transcript
of
heras
and
that
i'm
satisfied
in
--
looking
back
on
it
now,
was
both
what
i
had
in
my
mind
when
i
say
i
had
a
grand
jury
transcript
and
secondly,
it,
along
with
the
12
or
14
statements
that
we
have
of
heras,
was
the
reason
that
we
made
no
transcript
of
this
witness'
testimony.
this,
i
assure
the
court,
was
not
a
selective
effort
to
avoid
making
a
transcript
of
mr.
heras
for
any
purpose
whatever.
we
simply
didn't
need
it.
and
we
knew
of
no
obligation
toward
the
defense.
we
never
thought
of
it
that
would've
required
us
to
make
a
transcript.
now,
the
petitioner
says
and
admits
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
united
states
attorney
make
a
transcript.
but
they
say,
the
extraordinary
cases,
they
actually
--
that
this
is
an
extraordinary
case
and
therefore,
under
these
circumstances,
it
was
an
abuse
of
prosecutorial
discretion,
not
to
make
a
transcript.
now,
if
we
had
a
discretion,
then
the
question
is,
whether
or
not,
i
exercise
that
discretion
properly.
and
the
reasons
that
i
have
given
are
the
reasons
on
which
i
acted.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
only
in
part
and
on
a
small
part.
and
i
want
to
get
to
that
because
i
think
what
--
what
we
knew
about
mr.
heras'
reputation,
bears
on
whether
or
not,
it
was
proper
not
to
make
a
transcript.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
and
that
is
the
part
that
we
knew
about.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
and
that
i
want
to
mention
that
along
with
the
others.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
we
did
it
once.
we
simply
didn't
do
it
twice.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
certainly
would,
if
his
previous,
erroneous
or
false
statements
had
been
concerned
with
the
subject
matter
that
we
were
inquiring
about.
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
want
to
emphasize
this
and
a
--
you
--
of
these
two
statements
are
in
the
record
and
you
have
not
only
my
opinion
on
it,
but
also
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court.
the
two
--
the
only
two
really
contradictory
statements,
the
only
two
were
some
defense
brought
were
sufficiently
contradictory
put
in
the
evidence.
they
didn't
put
these
others
in
evidence.
the
only
two
were
on
a
matter
not
related
to
this
indictment.
the
judge
--
the
trial
judge
examined
that
and
look
at
both
of
these
statements.
they
did
not
concern
the
subject
matter
of
this
mail
fraud
indictment
in
any
fashion.
now,
they
did
show
that
this
man
had
made
a
false
statement
and
he
gave
us
the
explanation
of
that
and
he
gave
the
explanation
on
the
stand
under
cross-examination.
but
on
the
subject
matter
of
the
mail
fraud
--
all
of
the
matters
related
to
this
case,
the
witness,
heras,
not
only
was
accurate
and
truthful
from
the
stand,
but
he
was
accurate
and
truthful
in
the
preceding
statements
which
we
have.
now,
we
have
lodged
of
this
statement,
which
we
had
at
the
time
of
the
grand
jury
and
all
the
other
statements
of
heras
which
were
tendered
to
the
defense.
we
have
lodged
those
with
this
court,
where
they
are
available
for
inspection.
they
were
not
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
lodged
them
on
the
basis
and
in
relation
to
whether
or
not,
we
properly
exercised
a
discretion
in
not
recording
mr.
heras'
testimony.
i
have
read
those
three
grand
jury
statements
yesterday
and
today.
i
say,
i
reread
them,
because
it
was
on
the
basis
of
those
that
we
interrogated
to
heras
before
the
two
grand
juries.
i
have
reread
them
yesterday
and
today
and
i
think
that
any
fair
minded
man
with
the
facts
that
just
the
basic
facts
of
heras'
testimony
in
the
--
a
trial
court
in
his
mind,
could
read
those
statements
and
see
that
heras
was
a
consistent
witness.
he
was
not
a
misleading
or
evasive
witness.
his
story
was
straightforward
and
consistent
and
it
was
that
on
which
we
had
to
rely
when
we
put
him
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
subject
matter
of
the
two
statements
which
are
exhibits
--
defendant's
exhibit
213
and
214
and
are
printed
on
the
record.
the
subject
matter
involved
an
alligation
that
george
parr
had
heras
transport
a
sealed
envelope
to
corpus
christi
for
eventual
--
$5,000
for
eventual
payment
to
an
fbi
agent.
that
story
was
false
and
heras
said
it
was
false.
in
both
affidavits
--
in
both
affidavits,
there's
no
question
about
preoperative
facts.
in
the
first
affidavit,
he
said
the
story
is
false
and
i
never
told
any
such
story.
all
i
said
was,
i
told
the
facts
and
i
related
this
--
a
phone
call
that
mr.
parr
got
at
the
same
time
from
this
fbi
agent.
and
all
i
told
was
the
--
we're
trying
to
fix
a
date
and
a
time
of
--
and
things
that
occurred.
and
somebody
else
may
--
must've
put
the
things
together
and
got
this
rumor
started.
now,
in
the
second
affidavit,
mr.
--
mr.
heras
said,
the
--
it
is
not
true
that
any
such
money
was
conveyed
to
the
fbi
agent,
which
he'd
said
in
the
first
affidavit.
but
in
the
second
affidavit,
he
said,
“yes,
i
did
put
out
that
false
rumor.”
now,
let
me
give
you
the
circumstances
of
that
which
were
known
to
us
before
this
grand
jury
and
which
he
testified
to
on
trial.
heras,
on
trial
said,
“the
first
affidavit
is
true.
i
just
recited
the
--
the
facts
in
fixing
the
time
and
i've
never
spread
and
originated
this
rumor,
but
putting
two
and
two
together
to
make
four
here,
which
was
false.”
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
those
two
statements
are
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
had
it
here
just
a
moment,
mr.
(inaudible)
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
well,
they
are
in
the
record
and
i'll
get
first
to
you
later.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
exactly,
which
he
had
told
us
and
which
we
knew
or
believed
to
be
true
by
facts
not
known
to
other
people
at
the
time
for
those
affidavits.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
he
was
not
asked
about
that
i
believe.
i
don't
know
why
it
would've
been
because
this,
you
see,
did
not
relate
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
to
any
allegation
in
this
indictment.
it
was
--
no
relation
whatever
to
this
indictment.
the
only
connection
with
this
indictment
was
it
mentioned
the
name
of
the
petitioner,
parr,
and
that's
all.
and
the
trial
judge
examined
these
two
and
said
that
there
was
no
relevancy
to
the
diego
heras'
trial
testimony,
whatever
in
these
two.
but
he
did
admit
it
for
the
consideration
of
the
jury
as
bearing
on
his
credibility
and
that
was
all
for
impeachment
purposes
and
it
was
before
the
jury.
now
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
he
--
he
repudiated
part
of
the
first.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
he
went
back
to
the
first,
mr.
justice.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
it
is.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
he
said
that
was
the
truth
of
the
matter.
now,
let
me
give
you
the
circumstances
which
are
in
the
record
under
--
under
which
he
made
these
affidavits,
each
of
them,
they
are
made
two
days
apart.
the
one
on
april
the
9th,
1953,
was
made
while
he
was
in
the
hospital
at
galveston,
being
treated
for
nervous
disorder,
upset
stomach,
et
cetera.
he
was
treated
with
--
he
testified
with
injections
of
something
to
calm
his
nerves
and
to
--
he
was
fed
liquids
and
he
was
in
a
state
of
a
virtual
nervous
breakdown
and
nervous
exhaustion.
he
then
--
that
was
when
the
first
time
affidavit
was
taken.
he
then
was
transported,
accompanied
by
either
his
father
and
a
nurse
or
maybe
only
his
father,
to
275
miles
to
his
house
in
benavides,
where
he
was
in
bed
and
had
called
the
doctor
and
then
received
another
injection
to
quiet
him
at
the
time
the
second
statement
was
taken.
now,
it
was
under
those
circumstances
that
the
contradictory
statements
were
made,
all
of
which
was
brought
out
in
the
record
to
the
jury.
and
we
knew
the
facts
of
that
beforehand
and
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
your
honor.
they
both
had
been
made,
they
were
made
in
april
of
1953,
both
statements.
that
was
a
year
prior
to
the
time
i
took
office
incidentally.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that
is
correct.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that's
right.
and
i
knew
about
the
statements.
i
was
informed
of
them
and
i
reported
his
testimony
in
1954.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
well,
it
is
relevant
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
to
his
credibility.
but
let
me
put
this,
mr.
justice
black,
we
don't
agree
with
the
petitioners'
contention
that
heras
was
the
vital
witness
to
this
prosecution,
nor
we'd
agree,
is
the
most
important
witness.
in
fact,
we
say
that
this
case
could've
been
tried
without
heras.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
and
i
want
to
get
to
that.(inaudible)
mr.
heras
gave
about
--
they
say
about
1000
pages
of
testimony.
my
direct
examination
of
mr.
heras
was
only
107
pages,
i
think
--
100
--
my
direct
examination
was
107
pages.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
and
that
took
less
than
a
day.
he
came
on
the
stand
in
the
middle
of
an
afternoon
and
i
had
three
pages
after
lunch
the
following
day.
and
during
that
time,
there
was
about
46
pages
of
colloquy
on
the
meaning
and
import
of
the
jencks
decision.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
he
was
one
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
certainly
do.
and
we
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
well
mr.
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
don't
know
that
the
grand
jury
was
not
entitled
to
it.
i
only
feel
that
was
not
relevant.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
absolutely.
and
there
was
no
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
we
did
not
conceal
anything
about
heras'
culpability
in
this
--
that
from
the
grand
jury
or
from
the
trial
jury
either.
when
we
present
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
could've
put
it
in.
i
could've
told
the
grand
jury
about
that.
that
--
but
the
things
i
--
i
suppose
that
i
have
no
independent
recollection
now,
the
exact
questions
that
were
asked
and
so
on.
but
the
things
that
we
presented
to
the
grand
jury
were
concerning
this
case
and
we
also
presented
the
derogatory
information
on
the
witness,
diego
heras.
now,
i
want
to
make
that
clear
that
we
did
not
paint
this
witness
as
being
in
himself
of
unimpeachable
veracity
and
i
so
stated
in
the
record
on
the
stand
when
the
opposing
counsel
put
me
on
the
stand
and
asked
me
about
vouching
for
the
witnesses
and
so
on.
and
i
said,
in
effect,
that
we
had
to
take
them
as
they
were
and
that
i
told
the
jury
an
argument
that
we
had
labelled
this
man
as
a
coconspirator.
he
is
labelled
in
the
indictment
as
a
coconspirator.
he
is
labelled
as
a
participant
in
these
offenses
up
until
july
of
1951,
which
he
was.
and
the
--
no
item
or
material
proof
that
we
offer
before
the
grand
jury
or
before
the
trial
court
was
not
completely
supported
by
other
witnesses,
other
testimony,
and
best
of
all
the
documentary
proof
with
the
proven
signatures
of
most
of
the
defendants
thereon.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
absolutely
not.
at
no
time
and
if
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
indictment
which
we
eventually
drew
and
presented
to
the
grand
jury
labelled
heras
and
the
witness
--
not
a
witness,
she
wasn't
called
as
witness,
before
this
trial,
she
may
have
been
the
jury.
a
jury
may
feel
as
coconspirators.
that
was
submitted
for
the
grand
jury's
consideration
and
was
returned.
now
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
if
they
had
--
if
they
had
said
they
wanted
to
indict
heras,
we
would
have
done
so.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
only
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
these
two
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
their
fbi
statements?
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
don't
think
they
did.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i
can
only
say
in
reconstructing,
while
i
think
was
my
conduct
there
that
i
simply
did
not
go
into
these
two
statements
because
they
weren't
relevant
to
any
of
the
matters
there
being
concerned.
we
did
go
into
the
fact
and
spread
on
the
books
fully
that
heras
had
signed
these
fictitious
checks
that
he
taken
them
to
the
bank
that
he
had
participated
returning
the
proceeds
to
parr.
he
had
signed
other
fictitious
checks.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
jury
knew
all
about
heras'
conduct
here.
and
that
if
the
matters
of
these
two
conflicting
statements
were
not
something
that
was
before
the
jury
for
consideration
for
an
indictment.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
for
a
good
reason.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
if
you'll
--
our
testimony
of
--
the
testimony
of
heras
is
set
forth
in
the
record.heras'
participation
in
the
fraudulent
scheme
ended
july
12th,
1951,
when
the
books
and
all
were
moved
from
parr's
office
back
to
benavides.
every
check
in
evidence
and
we've
gotten
--
we've
got
a
huge
batch
of
checks
from
the
microfilm
of
another
bank,
besides
the
parr
banks,
which
shows
who
signed
all
of
the
checks.
and
heras
testified
he
never
signed
a
check
after
july
and
all
these
checks
in
evidence
bear
him
out.
he
didn't
sign
any
of
these
fictitious
checks
after
july.
he
was
cut
off
from
the
confidence
of
the
participants
in
this
scheme.
the
direction
and
control
of
it
was
taken
over
in
benavides
by
the
two
people,
chapa
and
carrillo.
the
bank
--
we
don't
have
to
rely
on
just
heras
and
the
checks
for
that
either.
we
have
the
eyeball
testimony
of
four
bank
tellers
in
parr's
own
bank,
as
to
what
went
on
there.
their
testimony
is
that
heras
did
not
come
in
with
these
checks.
we
have
able
to
fix
the
date
as
being
definitely
november
the
1st,
1951,
and
there
is
no
check
after
june,
so
we
have
no
proof
and
all
the
evidence
is
he
had
no
participation
in
the
scheme
after
july
12,
1951.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that's
right,
for
the
period
of
time
he
was
in
the
conspiracy.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
we
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
we
certainly
did,
before
the
jury
in
the
(voice
overlap)
---
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
how
we
would've
done
that.
the
various
compensators
were
--
not
all
of
them
were
in
the
conspiracy
for
the
entire
time.
it
would
--
but
that
was
a
matter
a
proof
at
the
trial,
we
didn't
distinguish
any
of
them
at
the
indict
--
in
the
indictment,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
we
alleged
that
the
conspiracy
existed
from
a
certain
date
until
february
1954.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
and
we
--
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
and
we've
alleged
that
various
people
were
members
of
that
conspiracy.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
the
testimony
of
errors,
as
the
fraudulent
scheme,
was
admitted
only
to
show
the
origin
of
the
scheme.
and
the
jury
was
so
instructed
and
the
testimony
was
so
limited
at
the
trial.
now,
of
course,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
he
was
barred
in
the
statute
of
limitation
on
march
the
6th,
1956,
when
the
indictment
was
returned,
in
any
conspiracy,
you
have
to
take
--
frequently
have
to
some
of
the
witnesses,
some
of
the
conspirators
and
use
them
of
--
as
witnesses,
if
they
are
willing.
now,
heras
was
willing
to
tell
all
he
knew
about
this,
and
he
did,
he
testified
freely
before
two
grand
juries.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
oh,
no
--
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
chief
justice,
you
misunderstood
me
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
and
i
wouldn't
mislead
you
for
the
world.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
you
asked
me
if
i
made
any
suggestion
to
the
grand
jury
that
they
not
indict
heras.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
said
in
answer
to
--
to
that,
that
we
prepared
the
indictment
which
named
him
a
coconspirator,
but
did
not
name
him
as
a
defendant.
that
is
only
suggestion
that
i
can
recall
and
that
was
my
answer
to
your
question.
and
that
was
an
indication,
of
course,
to
the
grand
jury
that
we
wanted
to
use
heras
as
a
witness,
which
we
did.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
oh,
yes.
oh,
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
now,
i
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
no,
mr
justice
frankfurter.
it's
not,
but
i
have
no
hesitancy
in
saying
that
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
oh,
yes.
i
have
no
hesitancy
in
saying
that
after
we
had
heard
all
of
the
evidence
and
i
will
point
out
that
while
mr.
fortas
wants
to
draw
some
adverse
conclusion
from
our
reserving
heras,
he's
appearing
on
the
last
day,
my
conclusion
would
be
that
the
jury
had
all
of
the
evidence
about
heras
as
well
the
other
conspirators
before
they
heard
him
and
we're
thus
free
to
ask
him
any
questions
they
want
with
all
the
facts
before
them.
i
have
no
hesitancy
in
saying
that
after
all
of
the
evidence
have
been
brought
before
this
investigative
grand
jury,
we,
attorneys
--
they
hadn't
analyze
it
and
decided
which
in
our
judgement
a
--
a
prosecutable
case
was
there
to
be
made.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
have
no
recollection,
sir.
in
some
cases,
it's
--
i'm
--
i'm
speaking
generally
not
of
this
case.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
in
some
cases,
i
--
i
know
i've
have
done
that
in
other
cases,
the
matter
is
clear,
the
indictment
is
laid
before
them
and
that's
it.
now,
in
--
in
this
case,
we
might
have.
i
have
no
recollection,
nowhere
one
or
another,
or
if
anything
like
that
was
said,
what
was
said.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
no,
i
don't
recall
it
ever
being
done
and
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
well,
in
all
frankness,
i
don't
think
that
heras
have
adjured
the
conspiracy.i
think
in
july
1951,
the
conspirators
adjured
him.
and
in
december
1952
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
they
--
they
cut
him
out
of
anything
to
do
with
it
entirely.
and
in
december
1952,
they
discharged
him
from
employment
with
the
school
district,
although
for,
later
on,
for
three
--
three
months
period,
they
asked
--
asked
him
to
do
some
specialized
work
in
concerning
city
lots
of
benavides,
in
his
own
office
and
paid
him
for
that.
i
--
but
the
evidence
is
very
clear
that
in
july
of
1951,
the
books
in
records
were
moved,
heras
was
--
meant
he
no
longer
had
any
part
--
and
in
his
responsible
part,
he
had
it
no
longer,
any
part
in
the
basic
elements
of
this
scheme
here.
i
want
to
say
also
that
making
a
grand
jury
transcript
is
unusual
in
our
district.
in
fact,
in
most
districts
and
the
only
reason
that
we
made
a
transcript
(inaudible)
was
that
this
was
a
investigative
grand
jury,
in
which
we
were
seeking
information
from
witness
which
we
did
not
have
in
full
and
therefore,
we
made
records
of
it.
in
the
case
of
heras,
we
had
12
or
14
statements
and
this
grand
jury
transcript
and
we
saw
no
reason
to
make
another
record
of
heras.
and
at
that
time,
we
had
no
idea
that
the
jencks
decision
was
a
year
and
a
quarter
away,
or
that
any
demand
would
be
made
for
his
transcript.
whether
we
had
any
obligation
to
at
all,
that
simply
was
not
in
my
mind
or
to
mind
of
any
my
assistants,
or
in
fact,
within
the
knowledge
of
our
experience.
now,
i
--
i
want
to
--
i
want
to
go
over
some
of
the
things
which
heras
testified
about
and
which
were
confirmed
absolutely
by
the
testimony
of
all
the
other
witness
called.
these
are
matters
that
we
knew
about
when
we
put
him
before
the
jury.
as
far
as
--
with
the
exception
of
those
two,
contradictory
fbi
statements,
as
far
as
we
knew,
he
was
reliable.
he
had
told
the
truth
that
we
have
checked
out,
about
this
case.
now,
let's
see
that,
heras
was
the
one
who
first
in
--
early
in
1953,
after
he
was
discharged
from
the
school
district,
he
made
statements
to
state
and
federal
investigators
in
--
in
regard
to
the
fictitious
names
on
the
report.
we
checked
that
out
with
the
postal
investigators
and
the
others,
interviews
with
postmasters
in
this
county.
and
at
trial,
we
put
on
eight
post
masters
and
three
or
four
other
witnesses
who
testified
that
these
names
were
indeed
fictitious.
and
this
we
knew,
as
to
the
practice
of
cashing
these
checks
at
the
bank,
we
didn't
rely
entirely
on
heras
for
that.
we
had
carl
williams,
edna
fitch,
cristine
ray
and
reed
nunnally
(ph)
who
had
either
dealt
with
heras
three
of
them
had
dealt
with
him
and
--
correction,
two
of
them
had
dealt
with
him,
the
other
one
that
seen
him
in
there,
and
mrs.
cristine
ray,
who
went
to
work
november
the
1st,
1951
taking
carl
williams'
place,
testified
that
she
had
never
dealt
with
heras
and
had
never
seen
him
in
connection
with
this,
but
the
fictitious
checks
kept
coming
in.
and
reed
nunnally
testified
that
oscar
carrillo's
visits
to
the
bank
increased
noticeably
and
--
number
at
that
time
and
he
went
to
see
donald.
now,
the
scheme
at
the
bank
as
revealed
by
this
eyeball
testimony
of
this
witness
was
that
heras
normally
went
to
donald
and
donald
went
the
individual
teller
and
picked
up
the
bundles
of
cash.
so
that
was
confirmed
in
every
way,
even
the
incident
about
heras
being
shortchanged
$1000
in
which
he
had,
one
time,
dealt
with
mrs.
fitch.
she
made
a
mistake.
she
was
interrupted
by
a
telephone
call
and
she
put
only
$3000
instead
of
$4000
in
the
envelope.
and
when
he
saw
that,
he
had
only
three
packs,
he
came
back
and
she
found
she
was
$1000
over
and
he
got
the
extra
thousand.
that
was
remembered
by
the
other
people,
he
took
her
a
box
of
candy
in
gratitude,
and
as
carl
williams
testified,
he
ate
some
of
the
candy,
the
whole
bank
knew
of
this.
this
was
no
secret
going
on
in
the
parr
bank
desk.
now
then,
as
to
benson,
and
benson
who
was
a
much
more
jolting
witness
to
the
defendants
then
was
heras.
benson
was
the
auditor.
he
had
handled
some
of
these
packages
of
money
in
one
case.
he
had
gone
to
the
bank
for
parr.
in
another
case,
he
had
conveyed
a
package
from
heras
to
parr,
which
heras
told
us
about.
and
furthermore,
benson
had
made
out
the
income
tax
returns,
not
only
at
parr,
but
at
chapa
and
carrillo.
and
he
knew
about
this
extra
funds
coming
in.
and
in
1953,
long
after,
heras
have
severed
any
connection
with
the
school
district,
benson
testified
as
to
the
$19,667
of
unidentified
income
in
chapa's
return
and
a
$10,200
unidentified
on
carrillo's
return.
and
there
were
others
years
prior
to
that
in
which
you
see
the
thing
just
building
up.
now,
as
to
obtain
your
signs,
mr
heras
told
us
that
signs
and
i
think
this
was
after
the
grand
jury,
but
it
confirmed
the
whole
thing.
then
mr.
saenz
had
an
account
with
the
hebbronville
bank
and
we
went
down
there
and
we
found
there
the
microfilm
and
you
see
the
microfilm
had
disappeared
for
this
five
years
from
the
two
parr
banks.
we
went
down
to
the
hebbronville
and
we
got
this
photostats
of
checks,
which
cover
from
1949
to
1953.
and
they
showed
that
benson
signed
--
countersigned
the
checks
until
1950.
that
george
parr
countersigned
thereafter,
with
exception
of
the
last
month
or
two
when
milligan
signed.
they
show
that
heras
signed
as
makers,
until
june
of
1951,
that's
the
last
check,
june
1951
and
thereafter,
the
factitious
checks
to
the
petitioners
signs,
which
were
in
eight
different
names
deposited
to
his
account,
were
signed
as
maker
by
oscar
carrillo
and
octavio
saenz,
which
confirmed,
what
heras
said
--
told
us
as
to
the
practice
in
the
office
of
who
signed
the
checks
and
who
prepared
them.
now
then,
in
addition
to
these
checks,
we
had
literary
hundreds
of
documents,
tax
notices,
receipts,
deposit
slips,
annual
reports
and
a
great
number
this
had
the
signatures
of
parr,
chapa,
saenz,
oscar
carrillo,
i
think
those
four
principally
on
them.
there
are
any
others
i
don't
recall.
the
fbi
handwriting
expert
analyzing
this
for
us
and
we
knew
that
the
signatures
of
the
petitioners
here
on
this
fraudulent
instruments
were
authentic.
there
--
the
petitioners
had
actually
participated
with
there
own
hand.
in
every
respect,
as
to
what
had
gone
on,
as
to
the
origin
of
the
scheme,
heras
was
confirmed
and
furthermore,
by
all
this
evidence,
we
carried
the
scheme
on
during
the
period
of
--
where
limitations
had
not
run.
as
i
say
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
oh,
the
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
--
i'm
glad
you
reminded
me
of
that.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
it
--
it
is.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
on
the
--
on
the
mail
fraud.
i'm
interested
in
the
--
doctor's
secretary
about
which
you
and
mr.
justice
whittaker
inquired.
it's
cited
about
three
times
at
each
brief
of
petitioner
and
i
think
one
of
the
justices
in
questioning,
pointed
out
the
fundamental,
fallacy
in
it.
and
it's
simply
is
that
there
is
no
use
of
the
mails
in
the
execution
of
any
fraudulent
scheme.
now
here,
we
have
a
fraudulent
scheme
of
a
giant
(inaudible).
in
doctor's
secretary
case,
we
don't
have
any
scheme
at
all
and
we
don't
have
any
use
of
the
mails
to
carry
it
out,
all
we
have
there
is
a
simple
embezzlement
case.
but
and
i
--
if
you
add
to
it,
as
i
think
was
suggested
by
mr.
justice
whittaker,
if
you
add
to
it,
the
element
of
the
secretary
increasing
the
bill
to
the
patient
fraudulently
and
procreating
the
extra
proceeds
and
then
remitting
to
the
doctor
the
legitimate
one,
you
have
a
mail
fraud
scheme.
i
think
mr.
fortas
admitted
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
now,
we
have
not
only
that.
but
we
have
a
case
where
the
secretary
controls
the
legitimate
expenditures
of
the
office.
the
secretary
controls
all
of
the
depositing
in
the
banks.
the
doctor's
secretary
controls
both
banks
where
the
money
goes
and
then
as
in
the
case
of
chapa,
fraudulent
tax
receipts
which
never
appear
on
the
tax
rolls
as
in
the
year
1953,
are
set
out
in
the
proceeds
appropriate.
we
have
a
classic
mail
fraud
scheme
here.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
it
would.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
as
i
understand
your
example,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
it
--
if
they
--
it
would
be
that
the
patient
comes
in
the
office
and
pays
by
cash.
i
don't
think
the
use
of
the
mail
is
--
is
there,
if
i
beg
your
example
right.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
think
i
have
your
example
now.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
you
have
posed
the
situation
in
which
there
is
a
fraudulent
scheme.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
with
no
use
of
the
mails
to
execute
it.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
so
there'll
not
be
mail
fraud.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
because
the
--
the
money
coming
in,
it
brought
in
the
checks
and
the
mail
is
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
appropriate.
it's
the
cash
that's
appropriate.
now,
if
you
mix
the
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
two
together,
you
mix
the
two
together
in
someway
and
you
posit
the
--
all
these
principles
of
control
here,
which
we
have
in
this
case,
then
you
have
different
situation
and
perhaps,
the
mails
would
be
used
there.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
--
i
don't
think
that
that
has
in
it
the
elements
of
a
mail
fraud
scheme.
but
in
our
case
here,
we
have
the
complete
control
of
the
operative
process
of
the
--
all
of
the
collections
and
disbursements
and
the
distribution
of
the
dividends
to
the
participants
in
the
fraudulent
scheme.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
no.
it
--
it
was
and
--
and
i
won't
get
to
that.
in
the
--
in
the
first
place,
i'll
point
out
very
quickly
that
counts
15
and
16
of
the
indictment
to
substantive
counts,
involved
under
anybody's
theory,
a
classic
case
of
mail
fraud
because
here
are
the
proceeds
of
the
checks
coming
in
through
the
mails,
which
are
misappropriated
by
one
of
the
conspirators
and
this
one
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
it
is.
in
this
respect,
we
have
two
--
where
we
have
two
instances
or
--
or
two
ways
to
--
to
look
at
that,
which
says
that
this
is,
in
effect,
this
case.
in
the
first
place
and
this
is
the
--
you
must
appreciate
this
to
the
size
of
the
scheme
and
the
continuous
nature
of
it.
we
have
here
a
five-year
continuous
scheme.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that
means
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that
means
that
it
would've
come
to
a
grinding
halt,
if
the
mails
had
not
been
used.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
absolutely.
mr.
justice,
what
the
petition
--
mr.

well,
they
were
(voice

--
mr.
malcolm

some
of

yes.
mr.

in

year
1953.
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
(voice

--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
the
legitimate
tax
bills
support
the
conspiracy
count,
count
20,
on
which
all
of
the
petitioners
were
convicted.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
don't
know.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
oh,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
spelled
out
as
an
overt
acting,
which
proved
there's
an
overt
act
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard

we
did.
and
additional
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
we
proved
the
over
acts
which
we
alleged
and
we
proved
others
in
addition.
and
they're
always
clearly
admissible
and
the
--
the
fraudulent
fictitious
tax
notices
set
out
by
chapa
in
1953,
were
admitted
on
the
conspiracy
count
to
support
it
and
also
as
part
of
the
general
scheme
on
the
substantive
counts.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
if
his
business
is
operated
essentially
through
the
mails,
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
if
the
man
who
pilfers
some
money,
has
control
of
the
use
of
the
mails
and
the
mails
are
used
to
get
in
the
money
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
over
a
period
of
time,
which
he
pilfers.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
if
it
was
a
continuous
scheme,
which,
i
think,
your
example
poses.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
don't
think
so
in
that
(voice

--
mr.
malcolm
richard

because
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
because
the
bookkeeper
is

of
the

what
happened
here
is
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
well
do
you
have
a
different
case.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
if
he
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
(voice

no,
not
that
entirely,
by
no
means.
we
have
this
situation
and
i
want
to
argue
this
case
and
i
perfectly
--
i
don't
want
to
be

i
don't
want
to
be
pinned
down
to
a
narrower
proof
or
--
or
far
list
evidence
of
mail
fraud
than
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.

that
was
what
(voice

--
mr.
malcolm
richard

yes,
the
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
evidence
shows
uncontradicted,
that
in
1953,
a
whole
string
of
taxpayers
were
left
off
the
tax
rolls.
and
that
a
special
(voice

mr.
malcolm
richard

they
certainly
did.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
we
have
the
receipts
and
evidence.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
through
the
mail.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
oh,
they
owed
them.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
but
they
decidedly,
have
planned
in
advance
to
appropriate
the
proceed
(voice

--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that
is
correct,
for
the
--
for
the
major
portion
of
the
scheme
here,
over
the
five-year
period.
but
let
me
go
--
let
me
explain
what
we
have
here,
we
don't
have
that
simple
scheme.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
money
was
at
all
times
in
no
manner
was
cash
or
taxpayer's
checks,
or
on
deposit,
in
the
control
of
the
conspirators
whether
it
was
in
the
--
the
tax
collector's
office,
which
was
mr.
chapa
and
carrillo,
parr's
banks
which
is
parr
and
donald
and
it
was
a
design,
intent
and
premeditation,
as
shown
to
this
evidence,
to
appropriate
and
split
the
proceeds
of
this
over
the
period
of
five
years.
and
the
petitioners
have
never
answered,
i
point
about
this
being
a
continuous
--
continuous
scheme
and
the
point
about
control,
which
makes
it
different.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
some
of
them
have
--
some
of
them
have.
i
don't
know.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
convictions
that
i
know
about.
they
were
convictions
of
parr,
donald
and
chapa
and
they
were
reversed.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
don't
know.
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
--
i
don't
know
where
they
--
those
--
those
people
have
not
been
retried.
i
don't
know
about
any
others
that
maybe
involved.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
not
been
retried
in
the
state.
and
those
reversals
took
place
long
after
this
indictment.
i
want
that
made
clear
because
the
petitioners'
brief
doesn't.
but
i
want
to
make
clear
that's
there's
not
10%
of
the
proceeds
involved
here,
as
was
suggested
by
--
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
counsel.
the
evidence
shows,
for
example,
in
1953,
that
the
receipts
from
the
state
and
taxes
amounted
to
$790,000,
that
the
budget
of
the
two
schools
was
a
little
over
$400,000
plus
six
employees
in
that
claim
office
at
benavides,
which
left
an
enormous
amount
of
money
for
the
conspirators
to
appropriate.
what
we
prove
specifically,
check
by
check,
was
only
a
small
part
and
it
is
that
the
operation
of
a
public
mail
order
business
which
made
it
over
a
period
of
five
years,
which
made
this
a
scheme
to
defraud
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
the
mail
fraud
statute.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
evidence
on
budgetary
figures
showed
that
between
benavides
and
freer,
the
revenues
were
split
exactly
equal
and
the
budget
in
each
case
was
almost
exactly
$200,000
for
the
two
schools
that
made
$400,000.
in
addition
to
that,
the
school
had
to
maintain
the
small
office
at
benavides
which
employed
about
six
people.
now
then,
in
the
same
year,
1953,
the
evidence
showed
that
the
tax
revenues
were
$650,000.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
plus
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
we
say,
because
the
petitioners'
plan
and
did
appropriate
it
to
their
uses
and
that
they
were
operating
this
public
business
for
their
own
benefit.
not
on
school
(voice

--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
to
provide
the
(inaudible)
for
the
conspirators
to
enjoy.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
it
isn't,
your
honor,
because
they
have
the
option
to
put
the
rate
anywhere
they
want
it.
in
1951,
they
raised
the
rate
to
the
legal
maximum.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
exactly
and
there's
had
to
be
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
proof
of
that
of
every
tax
bill
that
went
out.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
right.
that
is
why
we
say
that
all
of
these
mailings
were
necessarily
an
execution
of
the
scheme
and
were
in
themselves,
carried
fraudulent
misrepresentation.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
exactly,
only
if
you'll
look
on
government
exhibit
1
on
page
137
to
138,
you'll
see
that
your
exact
figures
are
that
the
tax
rate
was
raised
from
$1.50
for
the
year
ending
august
1950
and
on
government
exhibit
--
well
that's
the
rate
in
--
in
august
1950
and
on
government
exhibit
4
and
about
page
132,
the
tax
rate
is
now
$1.75
which
was
the
legal
maximum.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
absolutely.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
absolutely.
and
as
proof
of
that
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
the
following
year
after
these
people
were
kicked
out
of
the
school
district,
in
freer,
the
school
kids
instead
of
having
a
budget
of
$200,000
as
they'd
had
approximately
the
past
few
years,
had
a
budget
of
$278,000
spent
on
them,
without
any
change
in
the
tax
rate.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
and
they
had
no
way
of
being
caught
up
with
because
all
of
the
facets
of
the
scheme
were
within
their
power
and
as
mr.
parr
said
to
mr.
benson,
it
won't
happen
here.
i
have
got
control.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
that
it
is
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
in
our
brief.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
giving
the
indictment,
if
you
will,
if
you
will
refer
to
--
at
page
12
of
the
record
and
13,
you
--
you
will
see
that
the
charge
of
the
indictment
in
the
first
count
in
paragraph
14
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
oh
(inaudible)
a
charge
of
the
indictment
was
that
the
defendants
devised
and
intended
to
devise
a
scheme,
an
artifice
to
defraud
one
--
but
i'm
putting
in
these
numbers,
to
defraud
one
that
benavides
independent
school
district,
bisd.
two,
persons
obligated
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
texas
to
pay
taxes
to
the
bsid
herein
called
the
taxpayers.
that's
your
bloat
in
every
bill
that
went
out.
three,
the
state
of
texas,
that's
the
140,000
a
year,
in
addition
to
the
650,000
that
they
got
by
filing
the
fraudulent
annual
reports
with
the
state,
which
contained
all
these
fraudulent
checks
(inaudible).
that's
the
only
way
they
found
out
about
the
checks.
four,
and
the
persons
obligated
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
texas
to
pay
taxes
to
the
state
of
texas
and
to
obtain
the
money
and
property
of
the
bisd
and
the
taxpayers
for
themselves,
their
relatives,
associates
and
supporters.
now,
those
are
the
people
who
were
defrauding
those
four
categories.
now,
then
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
no.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
no.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
it
was
the
--
it's
a
--
it
was
our
proof
at
the
trial
that
as
i've
referred
to
the
record
that
the
assessment
did
go
upnd
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
the
money
was
appropriate.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
there
are
two
things
said.
not
over
the
tax
is
fixed
by
law
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
by
an
oath.
they
operated
within
the
legal
limit
fixed
of
the
--
rate
of
175
--
$1.75.
now,
within
that
limit,
they
fixed
the
budget
for
the
school
kids
and
kept
it
at
such
and
they
fixed
their
receipts
at
such
to
allow
this
(inaudible)
for
themselves.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
they
set
it
--
we
are
--
we
are
not
explaining.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
no.
no,
no
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
no,
because
they
were
out
of
control
of
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
our
--
we
do
not
presume
to
say
whether
the
tax
rate
should
have
been
lower
or
the
school
budget
should
have
been
higher,
because
that
would
be
at
matter
of
judgment,
if
the
judgment
were
harnessed.
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
--
the
rate
was
fixed
at
the
maximum
permitted
by
law
and
that
the
budgetary
expenditure
for
the
school
children
was
kept
at
a
figure,
which
in
1953,
allowed
a
--
a
visible
gap
of
the
margin
between
a
little
over
$400,000
and
$790,000.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that's
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
we're
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
absolutely,
and
that's
our
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
fraudulent.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
justice
black,
i
can
tell
you
that
we
didn't
request
any
such
charge
on
that.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
and
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
not
in
--
in
that
--
in
that
language,
but
we
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
will
not
--
not
on
that
--
not
the
way
you
put
it
there,
but
the
fact
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
we'll
be
glad
to
send
you
those
references,
but
i
want
to
say
now
that
we
didn't
take
in
position
here
or
at
the
trial
that
the
rate
had
to
be
so
and
so
or
that
the
budget
for
the
school
had
to
be
so
and
so.
we
simply
proved
that
so
much
went
for
legitimate
purposes
and
there
was
a
huge
amount
that
was
left
over
and
we
proved
they've
paid
them
by
item
on
checks
--
totally
got
$190,000
on
the
items
plus
others.
and
many
others
on
the
taxpayer's
check,
that
it
went
to
the
conspirators.
now,
that
was
--
that
was
our
--
our
proof
for
the
trail,
but
we
will
send
you
this,
you
must
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
it's
in
the
records.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
it
will
be
found
--
in
the
volumes
14
and
15
of
the
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
of
the
printed
record.
it
will
be
the
(inaudible)
counsel.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
it
comes
to
about
5800
and
something
that's
where
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
printed.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
was
asked
about
several
different
things.
one,
i
recalled,
being
asked
about
how
we
happened
to
get
a
copy
of
the
state
grand
jury
transcript
which
we
turned
over
to
the
defense.
the
answer
to
that
was
that
the
grand
jury
had
been
held
to
be
invalid
with
just
a
body
of
men
having
no
significance
in
law
and
after
that,
the
prosecutor
furnished
to
exist
as
a
statement.
and
we
turned
those
over
in
the
part
of
witnesses.
as
to
the
rest
of
my
testimony,
i
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
it's
--
it's
printed,
it's
there,
yes
it's
there.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
started
out
to
ask
you.
i'm
going
to
file
something
in
regard
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
in
the
questions
of
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
we
were
served
with
a
reply
brief
here
that
in
(inaudible)
31
pages
plus
41
of
the
exhibits.
i
haven't
had
the
chance
to
look
at
all
of
the
exhibits,
although
i've
read
the
brief.
i
would
appreciate
leave
to
file
of
whatever
an
answer
seems
to
be
called
for
there
and
no
questions
they
suggest,
we
should've
filed
an
affidavit
of
the
grand
jury
secretary.
we
have
that
affidavit.
we
would
like
to
print
that.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
i
understand.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
thank
you.
