mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes,
your
honor,
i
was
a
trial
counsel.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
i
was
preparing
to
do
that,
your
honor.
the
government's
theory
that
you
have
just
--
just
heard
here
was
not
its
theory
in
the
trial
court.
there
is
not
a
line
in
the
indictment
which
alleges
that
the
tax
bill,
since
the
taxpayers
were
inflated
or
were
excessive
or
illegal.
and
there
is
not
a
line
of
evidence
in
the
record
that
would
support
that
theory
even
if
had
been
alleged.
that
theory
--
i've
lived
to
this
case
four
years
and
the
first
time
i
heard
of
it
was
when
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
handed
down
last
year.
it
was
not
even
urged
by
the
government
at
the
trial
court.
we
--
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
no,
your
honor.
none
whatsoever.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes,
sir.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
i
understand
that
to
be
in
mr.
wilkey's
contention
--
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes,
sir.
we
say
that
that
was
not
their
contention
in
the
lower
court
if
the
record
would
bear
us
out.
the
contention
of
the
government
in
the
lower
court
was
that
money
came
in
sufficient
for
the
school
needs,
but
was
not
spent
for
proper
purposes.
and
i
can
give
you
a
record
reference
the
argument
of
counsel
is
printed
to
volume
14
of
the
record
at
pages
5006,
5007,
were
government
counsel
and
his
submission,
points
out
that
very
theory
that
the
money
came
in,
but
was
used
for
wrong
purposes.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
let
me
answer
you
this
way,
if
the
indictment
alleged
what
you
have
just
said
and
the
evidence
supported
it
and
showed
that
the
amount
of
money
raised
in
each
fiscal
school
year,
was
so
clearly
excessive
and
beyond
--
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes,
sir.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
well,
sir,
i
--
i'm
trying
to
answer
it.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
that
--
i
don't
--
i
wouldn't
be
with
that
position.
and
read
--
and
then
say
so,
as
that
we
have
cited
the
court
a
case
in
our
reply
brief,
madely
versus
the
trustees
of
the
conroe
school
district,
decided
in
1939,
by
court
of
civil
appeals
of
texas,
130
s.w.
2d
929,
which
clearly
holds
that
it
is
not
improper
for
a
board
of
trustee
to
accumulate
moneys
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
that
case,
they
accumulated
some
$150
--
$200,000
of
maintenance
tax
money,
which
the
district
used
for
construction
of
buildings
which
ordinary
will
be
supplied
by
a
bond
issue.
so,
it
is
not
illegal
for
a
school
district
to
set
a
budget
which
has
a
number
of
variable
factors
and
that
one
would
be
the
percentages
of
collections,
the
others
would
be
expenditures,
i
serve
as
a
school
board
trustee
for
six
years,
in
the
brownsville
district.
and
i
know
what
any
school
board
trustee
knows
that
you
can't
set
a
budget
with
accuracy,
you
have
some
variables
on
it.
but
under
the
government's
theory,
if
the
school
board
trustee
fixes
a
budget
of
lets
say,
were
an
expenditure
of
$10,000
is
required
for
utilities,
gas
and
electricity
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
the
tax
bills
are
sent
out
and
the
money
comes
in,
and
only
$5000
are
used
for
that
purpose,
the
other
$5,000
in
--
is
embezzled,
that
would
be
mail
fraud
case.
now,
justice
--
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
the
question
--
asked
us
a
question
a
while
ago
that
i
want
to
address
myself
to.
under
texas
law,
each
year
a
board
of
trustee
is
required
to
fix
a
budget
and
the
collections,
that
is
tax
collections,
are
based
upon,
one
valuations
fixed
by
a
separate
board
of
equalization
to
the
rate
which
is
fixed
by
the
school
board.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes,
sir.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
either
the
tax
rate
has
to
be
adjusted
or
the
valuations
and
usually
---
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes,
sir.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes,
sir.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
in
sometimes,
but
in
exceptional
cases
arrived
at
that
way.
usually,
the
board
takes
the
evaluation
submitted
to
it
by
the
board
of
equalization.
the
needs,
in
most
instances,
exceed
the
amount
of
money
the
board
is
going
to
get
anyway
and
applies
the
maximum
rate
to
it.
that
is
the
usual
procedure.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes,
your
honor.
but
it
is
not
illegal
in
texas
to
raise
money
in
excess
of
actual
needs
as
is
shown
by
the
budget.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
that
--
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes,
sir.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
it
could
be.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
my
position
is
one,
if
that
was
--
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
--
alleged,
and
secondly,
the
government
shall
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes,
sir.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
it
--
it
could
be
--
it
could
be
your
honor.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
this.
we
have
texas
statute
which
requires
a
budget
of
every
school
district
to
be
found
annually,
with
the
county
clerk.
all
of
the
government
had
to
do,
in
this
case,
was
to
go
to
the
county
clerk
and
get
the
school
budget
for
each
one
of
these
years
1951,
1952,
and
1953
and
offered
in
evidence,
and
that
it
failed
to
do
and
did
not
explain
its
failure
to
do
so.
in
other
words,
there
was
not
only
a
failure
of
allegation
in
this
case,
as
to
the
budgetary
need
in
the
requirement,
but
there
was
a
failure
of
proof
and
a
failure
to
explain
the
reason
to
supply
that
budget.
the
budget
that
mr.
wilkey
talks
about
is
an
oral
reconstruction
to
number
of
witness.
it
is
not
the
written
budget
that
a
school
district
in
texas
is
required
to
make
out
each
year.
and
i
would
like
to
say
this
further.
that
we
have
printed
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
appendix
--
our
reply
brief
filed
today.
appendix
b
which
shows
every
single
one
of
the
essential
mailings
that
form
this
basis
of
the
19
substantive
counts
in
this
case.
every
single
letter
involved
in
the
appendix
and
in
the
indictment
involved
a
use
of
the
mail
at
houston,
texas.
either
the
taking
or
the
placing
of
a
letter
there
was
a
theory
on
government's
part
to
the
taking
and
placing
was
caused
over
in
benavides,
by
the
petitioners,
250
miles
away.
each
one
of
the
exhibits
there
will
show
other
the
purpose.
everyone
of
them
was
for
the
legitimate
purpose,
either
of
the
taxpayer
sending
a
check
with
a
letter
of
transmittal,
or
this
oil
company
sending
its
bill.
now,
i
would
like
to
challenge
mr
wilkey's
statement
that
the
statutes
of
limitation
had
ran
against
diego
heras,
as
to
any
offense.
and
if
the
court
has
before,
if
the
members
the
of
the
court
have
before
them,
the
appendix
to
our
brief
on
page
13
(a),
you
will
see
a
letter
which
is
the
basis
for
the
first
count
of
the
indictment,
signed
by
diego
heras
dated
september
the
26th,
1952.
the
petitioner
(inaudible)
convicted
on
that
count
and
the
statue
of
limitation
did
not
run
on
that
count
until
september
of
1957,
after
this
case
was
tried,
the
last
time.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
that
is
on
page
13
(a).
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
the
indictment
was
returned
in
march
of
1956,
your
honor.
mr.
heras
could've
been
indicted
on
that
one
count
that
the
other
petitioners
were
convicted
on
up
until
september
the
26th,
1957.
the
same
thing
is
true
count
7,
which
appears
at
page
22
(a)
of
the
appendix.
there
is
a
letter,
dated
december
the
3rd,
1952,
signed
by
mr.
diego
heras,
on
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
with
two
exceptions,
were
convicted
on
that
letter
and
mr.
heras
could
have
been
indicted
on
that
letter,
until
december
the
3rd,
1957.
your
honor,
my
time
is
about
out
here
and
i
would
just
like
to
say
this,
the
government
has
switched
its
theory
in
this
case,
from
reliance
from
the
letters
which
are
described
in
the
last
numbered
paragraph
of
each
count
of
the
indictment
which
was
simply
a
legitimate
use
of
the
mails
of
houston
for
the
purpose
of
paying
and
collecting
taxes
to
one,
in
which
they
mentioned
receipts,
notices,
letters,
properties
left
of
the
rolls
and
not
in
single
count
in
this
indictment,
not
one
involves
a
piece
of
property
which
was
not
on
the
rolls.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes,
sir.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
i'm
not
certainly
--
certain
that
i
followed
your
example
completely,
mr.
justice
harlan.
would
that
be
before
preparation
on
the
school
district
budget?
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
well,
sir,
my
answer
first,
of
course,
is
that's
not
their
scheme.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
i
think
--
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
that
could
be
an
indictable
offense
under
mail
fraud
statute
provided
--
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
--
the
school
district
budget
showed
that
an
amount
clearly
in
excess
of
the
district
needs
--
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
yes,
sir.
mr.
t.
gilbert
sharpe
in
standing
alone,
my
answer
would
be,
no,
sir.
i
would
like
to
say
this
in
conclusion,
that
if
the
court
and
the
members
of
the
court
will
look
carefully
at
the
exhibits,
in
appendix
b,
of
our
reply
brief
and
considered
carefully
the
nature
and
purpose
of
each
one
who
those
essential
exhibits
that
i
believe
the
conclusion
would
inevitably
follow
that
the
purpose
of
the
use
of
the
mails
in
this
case
was
not
to
defraud
and
that
all
that
the
government
had
shown
here
is
a
series
of
embezzlement
disconnect
with
any
proper
use
of
the
mail.
