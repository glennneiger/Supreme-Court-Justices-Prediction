this
is
no
new
idea
here.
this
is
--
this
was
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals,
wasn't
it?but
no
file
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
have
the
--
i
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
why
we
have
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
and
had
any
of
it
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
what
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
still
don't
quite
under
--
understand
about
your
texas
law,
don't
you
strike
a
tax
rate?
justice
potter
stewart
as
the
consequence
of
dividing
the
rateables
into
the
requirements?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
it
as
a
maximum
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
tax
rate
of
$1.75.
justice
potter
stewart
but
assume
you
had
rateables
with
requirements
which
dividing
the
latter
by
the
former,
would
give
you
a
tax
rate
of
$1.25,
well
within
the
statutory
--
the
statutory
limit,
is
that
the
way
you
arrive
in
a
tax
rate
in
texas?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
is
--
this
is
because
in
order
to
raise
as
--
an
amount
this
close
as
possible
to
the
needs,
you
then
apply
the
maximum
tax
rate?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
this
--
this
i
appreciate.
in
other
words,
you
might
have
a
--
a
provision
in
a
budget
which
you
--
everyone
knows
is
going
to
--
to
result
in
a
surplus.
justice
potter
stewart
over
actual
expenditures
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
that
year.
nevertheless,
if
you
have
such
a
provision
in
the
budget,
and
were
not
now
dealing
with
a
--
a
budget
and
valuation
which
will
realize
more
than
--
would
require
a
rate
higher
than
the
maximum.
if
you
still
have
this
provision
in
the
budget
for
the
surplus,
that's
reflected
in
the
rate
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
in
that
--
in
that
circumstance
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
suppose,
they
fixed
the
provisions
in
the
budget
with
the
intention
before
they
fixed
it
of
stealing
the
surplus
when
the
proceeds
were
--
tax
proceeds
were
collected,
is
it
your
position
that
still
would
not
be
tax
fraud?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
parting
from
--
apart
from
what
was
alleged?
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
or
would
it
not
in
your
judgment
to
the
mail
fraud.
