if
the
court
had
--
i
happened
to
be
very
sensitive
to
show
practices
by
a
prosecutor.
is
there
any
suggestion
that
this
was
a
purposeful
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

purposefully
not
to
have
minute
for
this
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
makes
a
lot
of
difference
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

an
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
district
attorney
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps,
because
i
was
brought
up
when
there
were
no
stenographers
before
a
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
indeed,
it
wasn't
allowed
to
have
them
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that
colors
my
interest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
knowing
why
this
was
done
and
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
there's
a
slightest
basis
for
inferring
shop
practice,
as
i
call
it
my
link,
or
whether
it
was
something
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
are
then
--
you
are
then
urging
dereliction
of
duty.
justice

upon

justice

upon
request
or
volunteered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
fraud
in
the
doctor-secretary
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
fraud
at
all,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
fraud
here,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
mail
fraud.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
there
was
a
fraud.
justice
felix
frankfurter
many
--
and
the
problem
here
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
the
question
is
whether
there's
any
relation
of
the
mails
to
this
fraud?
in
your
doctor's
case,
there
was
no
fraud.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
secretary
stoles
the
money
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
was
no
antecedent
fraud,
so
there
couldn't
be
any
connection
between
a
fraud
and
subsequent
conduct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
this
is
a
mail
fraud
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
there's
a
distinction
between
a
fraud
and
--
and
subsequent
events
and
no
fraud.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
arguing
volume
1
of
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
your
initial
date
--
would
your
initial
date
antedate
the
statute
of
limitation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
part
of
the
grand
--
mr.
wilkey,
is
that
part
of
grand
jury
for
this
--
for
as
your
statement
that
i
might
call
your
adviser
instruction,
your
legal
statement
to
the
grand
jury
as
to
who
is
indicted
and
who
is
not
for
their
--
for
their
consideration.
is
that
transcribed?
is
that
in
the
minutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
touching
the
word
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
the
privacy
of
your
office
you
analyzed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
then
make
some
kind
of
analysis
or
summary
of
what
the
evidence
--
what
prosecutable
offenses
were
made
out
by
the
evidence,
what
were
not
to
the
grand
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
happen
to
know
what
--
what
was
your
practice,
if
you
had
a
practice
of
having
youre
statements
to
the
grand
jury
in
summary
or
explanation
of
what
the
evidence
disclosed
or
manifest,
was
that
taken
down
by
a
stenographer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
comingle
--
if
you
comingle
the
two
funds
that
the
chief
justice
question's
possible,
you
comingle
the
two
funds
namely,
they
get
a
lot
of
patients
to
leave
their
x
dollar
behind,
but
some
patients
they
--
they
bill
and
they
get
a
--
an
amplified
fund
and
the
funds
go
--
and
the
money
that
comes
in
through
the
--
through
the
checks
in
the
mail,
they
have
a
full
control
of
depositing
the
checks
and
getting
them
cashed
on
the
bank.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
every
--
but
every
piece
of
--
of
every
document
that
is
deposited
in
a
mail
chute
or
a
mailbox
or
a
drop
in
the
--
in
the
post
office
substation,
would
everyone
of
those
documents
innocent
--
i
mean
such
that
--
the
bills
that
was
sent
out
for
the
taxes
and
what
the
taxpayer
returned,
the
humble
oil
company
and
the
others,
but
each
one
of
those
in
and
of
itself,
in
isolation,
innocent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
it
has
been
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
late
as
in
know
where
it
happens,
mr.
wilkey?
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
it
have
to
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
over
the
acts
conceded
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
require
overt
act,
the
conspiracy
statute
does,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
overt
act.
now,
do
you
not
have
to
prove
the
overt
act
was
lame?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
that?
and
so
i
ask,
whether
one
of
the
overt
acts
that
you
laid,
was
this
1953
illegal
or
bloated
tax
claims.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

can
you
by
evidence,
to
state
in
your
conspiracy
charge
as
being
effectuated
by
an
overt
act,
unless
you
laid
the
overt
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
relation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
relation
between
the
$700,000
part
and
the
$400,000
that
you've
just
mentioned?
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
the
$400,000,
what
was
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
tax
revenue,
you
mean,
the
money
they
got
in
from
sending
out
bills?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
know
why
--
why
was
more
money
received
in
the
$400,000
amounting
to
the
budget
of
the
two
towns?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
how
--
why
was
$700,000,
why
were
tax
bills
for
$700,000
sent
out?
it
must've
been
sent
out
in
order
to
come
in,
if
the
budgetary
requirements
were
only
$400,000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then,
it
isn't
a
case
of
sending
out
compulsory
legally
required
taxes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
they
meant
--
they
manipulated
the
tax
system
in
order
to
have
revenues
out
of
which
to
spoon
out
or
to
--
to
spoon
out
moneys
for
their
own
feeding,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
when
mr.
black
and
i
get
our
tax
bills,
we
get
bills
that
are
fixed
by
law.
these
people
were
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fixing
the
amount
of
tax
bill
that
they
sent
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
just
saying
--
are
you
saying
that
having
power
to
fix
a
rate
within
a
statutory
limit,
they
fixed
it
not
from
the
point
of
view
of
procuring
taxes,
to
serve
the
public,
they
fixed
it
with
a
deliberate
scheme
to
get
money,
go
for
chance
within
the
legal
limits
in
order
to
funnel
it
into
their
pocket.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
heard
what
--
you've
heard
what
justice
black
wants.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
keep
in
mind
what
i
like
to
your
testimony.
as
i
understand
your
case
that
these
people
having
legal
machinery
in
their
hands,
designed
a
scheme
to
use
that
legal
machinery
so
as
to
produce
funds
out
of
which
they
could
scoop
illicit
profits
for
their
pocket.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
it
--
it
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
rephrase
what
i
understand
to
be
the
claim
of
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
the
rate
was
excessive
or
bloated,
but
it
was
so
fixed
at
such
a
rate
that
money
would
be
forthcoming
out
of
which,
they
could
take
what
they
schemed
from
the
beginning
to
take.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
that's
a
very
different
thing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
things
that
bloated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
regard
--
and
if
there
was
such
a
scheme
to
do
that,
if
there
was
a
designed
scheme
to
fix
the
rate,
held
be
it,
it
might
be
a
legal
rate
to
fix
a
rate
to
the
end,
that
the
school
purposes
maybe
satisfied
thereby,
but
also
some
cream
maybe
skimmed
off
and
then
the
mail
was
used.
the
mails
were
used
the
way
they
were
used
here,
would
you
say
that
was
or
was
not
within
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
not
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
not
in
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
