are
you
going
to
draw
anything
out
of
them
on
this
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
spend
much
of
your
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
can
you
give
me
--
you
carefully
limit
yourself
with
what
the
opinion
had
limited
to
itself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
where,
to
take
up
sides
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
essence
of
your
position
that
in
view
of
specific
severability
provisions
a
segment
is
given
to
an
applicable
severability
unless
the
court
can
say
that
that
which
fell
is
so
indispensable
or
indispensably
chose
inexplicably
in
this
crime
is
that
claimed
to
remain
that
you
can't
separate
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
go
a
long
way
to
say
that
congress
has
decided
it
to
be
opposite?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
be
--
are
you
trying
to
(inaudible)
arguments
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
the
selection
of
cases
been
according
to
types
of
offenses
or
what?
what
have
been
the
determinants
with
respect
to
these?
justice
felix
frankfurter
local
commander
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
put
it
non-conclusive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
we
know
that?
how
can
we
tell?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
there
are
more
--
there're
capital
offenses
and
there
are
all
the
rest
of
the
offenses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
instance
--
the
incident
of
capital
offenses
and
each
of
them
divided
by
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
still
don't
understand
though
why
that's
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
i
understand
that,
but
why
--
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
the
important
thing
is
how
many
capital
offenses
are
committed
as
against
noncapital
offenses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
even
assuming
there're
so
many
worldwide
electricians,
there
are
fewer
crimes
--
potentially
less
than
crimes,
why
commit
--
after
all
the
(inaudible)
which
is
not
a
common
profession
worldwide,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
different
bases
of
the
united
states
throughout
the
--
throughout
the
world,
are
there
bases
where
the
government
has
housing
facilities
for
its
civilian
employees
attached
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
make
the
picture
turn
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wasn't
--
insofar
as
this
argument
is
relevant
on
either
side,
wasn't
there
a
very
strong,
a
powerful
feeling
in
congress
against
trial
that
the
americans
could
be
tried
by
--
by
our
tribunals
against
their
being
tried
under
what
was
rather,
i
thought
a
rather
chauvinistic
attitude
on
the
part
of
many
congressmen
that
you
can't
get
their
trials
in
--
in
the
various
host
countries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
--
having
the
source
of
the
state
of
the
court
for
agreement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
they
were
very
unwilling
to
give
permissive
jurisdiction
of
the
host
countries.
wasn't
there
a
very
strong
feeling
that's
been
involved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
make
it
less
congressional
because
it's
chauvinistic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you're
taking
a
lot
of
territory
where
you
take
it
very
easily.
that
involves
a
lot
of
other
factors
that
under
our
present
consideration
about
the
whole
--
the
whole
problem
with
capitulation
that
there's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
suggest
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
power
--
if
the
power
had
been
exercised,
avowedly
as
an
exercise
of
the
war
power
would
the
charges
of
designated
different
article?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
by
that
if
this
were
under
the
war
power,
the
charges
against
him
would
nevertheless
under
article
134
and
125?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
introductory
recital?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
virtue
of
article
18,
we
charge
him
under
134
and
125.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
the
punishment,
the
allowable
punishment
be
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
other
consequences
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
piece
of
paper
which
alleges
the
charges
because
it
has
on
the
back
where
indictments
have
a
clause,
whether
it
would
be
article
1
under
which
charges
are
brought,
you
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
as
you
--
as
i
understood
you,
you
said
either
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
war,
the
charges
would
nevertheless
be
particularized
as
under
125
and
134,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
elucidated
--
enlighten
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
article
18
would
have
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
one,
the
big
one
or
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
wilson
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
as
i
understand
that,
that
incorporates
though
with
the
specific
crime
against
which
the
court-martials
--
for
which
the
court-martials
sit
all
the
enumerated
provisions
of
the
articles
of
war,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
there
is
the
penal
code
with
specific
offenses
punishable
under
the
--
as
a
matter
of
war
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
supposing
--
and
so
then
as
i
understand,
you
correct
me,
it
had
been
an
introduction
by
virtue
of
article
18,
we
charge
the
following
offenses
specified
in
the
articles
of
war,
(inaudible)
234
and
235,
does
that
admit
the
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
in
controversy
between
you
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that's
the
position,
the
part
of
united
states
has
been
taking
quite
internationally
all
these
months
that
the
original
--
the
original
legal
doctrine,
the
arrangement
by
which
we
are
now
in
berlin
is
not
a
big
difference
than
it
was
when
it
was
officially
signed,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
again
ask
you,
does
mr.
weiner
deny
all
these?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
ask
whether
it's
binding,
i
just
wanted
to
know
whether
he's
consented
or
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
second
point
and
the
controversy
is
that
may
--
in
the
fact
to
which
i'm
going
to
align
but
i
don't
know
what
to
do,
but
i
inferred
that
he
isn't
driving
whatever
it
is
other
than
20
pages
on
the
single
question
that
the
court-martial
charges
didn't
specifically
state
they
were
under
article
18.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
going
to
the
whole
merit,
isn't
he,
that
this
was
not
that
--
that
as
a
matter
of
military
law,
article
of
war
or
not,
18
or
not,
this
was
not
in
the
field,
isn't
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
procedural
--
from
the
procedural
point
isn't
decisive
of
this
case,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
he
admit
that
that
it
could
be
if
it
had
been
properly
laid?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this
if
you
clearly
answer,
could
it
have
been
broad
under
article
18?
justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
part
of
those,
there
would
have
been
--
there
was
follow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
offering
me
that
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
like
williams
against
the
united
states
of
procedure
meant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
wrong
designation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
tribunal
itself
was
not
constituted
according
to
the
jurisdiction
on
which
it
is
now
sought
to
sustain
the
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
been
going
on,
on
this
piece
of
paper
to
set
forth
whereas
united
states
was
non-occupying
power
in
berlin,
et
cetera.
this
tribunal
is
constituted
in
the
exercise
of
the
power
--
but
the
authorities
going
from
the
power
of
occupation.
does
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
are
this,
may
i
ask
this,
if
they
had
charged
him
as
one
subject
to
the
laws
of
war,
would
the
substantive
offenses
for
which
he
would
then
be
prosecuted
as
under
the
laws
of
war
had
been
articles
225
and
234.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
what
could
he
have
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
constituted
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
this
would
be
the
laws
--
violating
the
laws
of
war
is
an
offense
and
not
these
offenses
particularized
would
be
as
it
were
bill
of
particulars?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wasn't
complaining,
i'm
just
noting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
attorney
general
should
come
in
and
say
an
act
of
congress
is
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wiener,
does
this
matter
come
up
at
all
during
the
regime
of
the
general
crowder?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
local
meaning?
justice
felix
frankfurter
regulation
meaning
the
article
(inaudible)
also?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
telling
us
that
--
do
you
tell
us
that
the
soldiers
maybe
would
--
would
out
of
his
(inaudible),
a
soldier
maybe
charge
as
for
a
violation
of
the
law
of
war
in
that
he
violated
any
particular
section
of
the
articles
of
war?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
are
--
there
are
laws
of
war
that
are
not
particularized
in
the
articles
of
war
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
the
articles
of
the
laws
of
war
violates
or
obedient
to
the
laws
of
war
means,
the
obedience
to
the
special
aspects
of
conduct
that
pertain
to
war
and
also
obedient
to
the
articles
of
war
unrelated
to
the
actual
conduct
of
war?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
--
what
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
either
cognizable
because
it's
one
of
the
articles
of
war?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
do
you
know
which
to
pick
and
which
not
pick?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
condemned
by
a
civilize
nation
as
a
matter
of
civil
law
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
if
anything
that
it's
so-called
civilized
nations
of
world
condemn
as
criminal
conduct
would
that
be
prosecuted
for
--
as
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
war?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
contained
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
--
is
this
amorphous
body
of
a
prohibition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
winthrop
say
what
you
said
that
laws
of
war
include
not
merely
conduct
related
to
the
conduct
of
war
and
in
relation
to
war
such
as
the
offences
for
which
the
nurnberg
trial
which
tried
the
nazi
members
but
also
that
which
in
the
acceptance
of
the
civilized
war
of
this
criminal
act.
they're
unrelated
having
those
special
relationships
with
or
significance
toward
to
the
war.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
because
congress
has
made
it
an
offence,
it
had
given
court-martial
jurisdiction,
which
one
is
it,
18?
justice
felix
frankfurter
eighteen
as
--
as
proscribed
any
person
by
law
are
subject
to
trial
to
by
law
of
war.
in
other
words
law
of
war
absorbs
all
this
undefined
and
on
particularized
misconduct.
