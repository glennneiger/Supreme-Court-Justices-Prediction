mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
colombia
circuit,
is
the
first
of
four
cases
now
before
the
court,
involving
once
again
article
2
(11)
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
which
was
before
the
court
two
years
ago
in
the
covert
case
and
which
--
in
which
congress
sought
to
empower
courts-martial
with
jurisdiction
over
dependants
and
employees,
accompanying
and
serving
with
the
armed
forces
overseas.
of
the
four
cases
before
the
court,
the
first,
third
and
fourth
involve
employees
and
the
second
case,
immediately
succeeding
case,
involves
a
dependant.
of
the
four
cases,
all
involved
noncapital
crimes
except
the
last
which
is
a
case
of
a
civilian
charged
with
a
capital
crime.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
sir,
a
person
who
is
not
enlisted
or
commissioned
in
the
armed
forces
in
that
sense.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
is
an
employee
of
the
department
of
the
air
force.
respondent
is
an
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
sir
the
respondent
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
that
is
our
position.
respondent
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
sir
i
will
try
to
--
limit
our
--
our
position
to
people
serving
the
armed
forces
overseas.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
were
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
they
were
all
civil
service
employees
of
the
particular
armed
service
involved.
they
were
non-employees
of
contractors
or
anybody
else.
that
is
they
were
directly
employed
by
the
federal
government
and
each
of
the
three
employee
cases
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
were
all
civil
service
employees
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
i
say
civil
service
generally.
the
respondent
here
was
once
called
a
wage
board
employee
as
so
many
are
in
the
united
states.
he
was
paid
on
an
hourly
basis,
but
he
was
in
the
--
he
was
in
the
same
situation
as
comparable
employees
in
the
united
states
would
be
at
air
force
installations
or
air
force
posts
here
in
this
country.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
the
third
case
wilson
was
also
a
civil
service
employee
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
he
was
a
regular
civil
service
employee
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
he
had
i
think
a
gs
and
that
--
whatever
it
is
and
then
--
and
then
the
fourth
case,
the
grisham
case,
he
was
an
auditor
with
the
corps
of
engineers
stationed
ordinarily
at
nashville.
he
was
on
six
months
temporary
duty
with
the
corps
of
engineers
in
orleans,
france.
he
also
had
a
gs
number.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
for
the
three,
sir?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
well
no
there
--
except
the
one
factor
that
in
the
wilson
case
which
is
the
third
case,
he
was
stationed
in
berlin
and
we
make
a
separate
argument
as
to
the
status
of
berlin
as
being
a
place
where
the
law
of
war
applies
and
so
that
he
could
have
been,
he
could
be
court-martialed
under
that
basis
of
jurisdiction.
otherwise
there
is
no
difference
as
to
the
three
employees.
guagliardo,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
journeyed
to
morocco
and
he
there
became
an
employee
of
the
air
force
department
at
nouasseur
air
base
which
is
near
casa
blanca
in
rabat,
in
morocco.
he
was
an
electrical
lineman
charged
with
maintaining
and
keeping
the
lighting
on
the
airfield
there
and
of
course
since
this
was
an
airfield
that
was
an
important
and
significant
post.
he
had
a
--
a
--
all
the
status
and
privileges
and
benefits
of
persons
accompanying
the
armed
forces
overseas.
that
is,
although
he
himself
lived
in
casa
blanca
in
an
apartment,
he
had
a
quarters'
allowance
just
like
many
officers
do,
many
higher-grade
non-commissioned
officers
who
don't
live
on
the
post,
but
live
in
a
nearby
town.
he
had
commissary
privileges,
exchange
privileges,
officer
club
privileges,
medical
and
mail
privileges.
the
offense
of
which
he
was
charged,
kept
together
with
two
enlisted
airmen,
was
the
--
was
the
offense
of
larceny
and
conspiracy,
to
commit
larceny
of
government-owned
goods.
there
were
some
leatherette
goods
and
olive
drab
fabric
material
owned
by
the
government,
the
air
force,
on
this
base,
the
nouasseur
air
base
depot
in
morocco
and
he
was
charged
together
with
these
enlisted
men
with
at
least
two
counts
of
larceny
and
conspiracy
to
commit
larceny.
under
the
manual
for
courts-martial
the
maximum
penalty
is
five
years
for
this
--
these
offenses
and
there
was
a
trial
held.
he
did
object
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court-martial
over
him.
he
was
found
guilty
on
both
counts
together
with
the
airmen.
he
was
sentenced
to
three
years
confinement
and
a
$1000
fine.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
local
civilians,
not
americans
were
involved.
they
were
not
tried
mr.
justice
by
the
court-martial.
there
was
some
suggestion
that
they
were
tried,
but
i
cannot
actually
say
whether
it
was
true,
by
the
local
moroccan
courts.
there
was
apparently
from
the
court-martial
record,
arraigned,
and
which
involved
these
three,
the
two
airmen
and
this
employee
and
some
local
civilians.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
were
both,
substantive
offence
of
larceny
and
conspiracy
to
commit
larceny.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
on
review,
his
sentence
was
cut
down
to
two
years
and
the
fine
was
eliminated
and
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals
denied
petition
for
review.
he
brought
habeas
corpus
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
meanwhile
i
should
say
he
was
brought
from
confinement
in
morocco
here
to
the
united
states
pending
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
the
district
court
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
five
years
sir,
five
years.
he
was
not
discharged
by
the
district
court
and
he
took
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
pending
his
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
granted
him
bail
since
the
spring
of
1958
and
he
has
been
on
bail
since
that
time.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
ordered
that
habeas
corpus
should
issue.
it
did
not
do
so
on
the
constitutional
grounds
which
were
mooted
so
much
before
the
court
in
the
covert
case.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
statute,
article
2
(11)
was
inseparable
and
therefore
that
–
it's
application
in
the
covert
case,
having
been
shown
to
be
invalid,
the
whole
of
the
article's
fell
and
the
court
did
not
have
to
decide
for
itself
whether
it
was
invalid
as
applied
to
this
employee
charged
with
a
noncapital
offense.
i
shall
of
course
argue
that
was
error.
as
the
court
recalls,
in
the
covert
case
the
court
that
this
court
had
before
it,
two
dependants
not
employees
charged
capitally
and
by
virtue
of
the
division
of
the
court,
the
only
decision
of
the
court
in
the
covert
case
was
that
those
two
dependants,
servicemen's
wives
charged
capitally
could
not
be
constitutionally
tried
by
court-martial.
as
the
court
will
recall
there
was
no
opinion
for
the
court.
mr.
justice
black
rendered
an
opinion
which
three
other
justices
joined
and
i
mention
to
the
court
that
in
at
that
opinion,
mr.
justice
black
reserved
the
question
of
whether
there
might
be
other
people
not
in
uniform
and
not
enrolled
or
unlisted
who
would
be
subject
to
court-martial
jurisdiction.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
justice
harlan
very
specifically
limited
their
concurrences
to
the
subject
of
dependant
wives
charged
capitally.
so
we
think
that
the
covert
case
leaves
open
for
this
court
the
question
of
the
coverage
to
court-martial
jurisdiction
of
all
employees,
those
charged
noncapitally
as
in
this
case
or
capitally
as
in
the
fourth
case
to
be
heard
tomorrow.
and
it
also
leaves
open
we
believe
the
question
of
dependants
charged
noncapitally
as
will
be
the
situation
and
the
case
to
be
heard
immediately
after
this
one.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
certainly
think
that
that
is
certainly
true.
yes
i
will
turn
–
i
will
turn
immediately
to
the
question
of
separability
which
is
the
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
went
and
as
the
--
as
the
court
knows,
this
court
has
frequently
stated
that
a
statute
is
separable
if
the
invalid
parts
are
not
so
intertwined
with
the
other
parts
that
they
bring
the
whole
thing
crashing
down
like
samson
brought
the
temple
down
in
the
bible.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
problem
of
separability,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
none
of
them
get,
that's
right
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
on
the
subject
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
a
certain
inference
could
be
drawn
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
that
both
you
and
mr.
justice
harlan
carefully
limiting
your
concurrences
to
the
situation
then
before
the
court
gave
certain
rise
to
the
--
the
very
great
possibility
that
the
statute
might
be
valid
as
applied
in
other
circumstances
not
then
before
the
court.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
taking
that
advice
mr.
justice
i
go
on
to
the
[laughter]
--
to
the
provisions
of
article
2
(11)
itself.
the
court
in
its
discussion
of
separability
has
indicated
that
light
can
be
drawn
from
the
wording
of
the
particular
statute
and
also
from
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
separability
clause
and
the
explicitness
of
the
separability
clause.
we
have
both
factors
here.
we
have
a
statute
on
page
three
of
article
2
(11)
of
the
government's
brief
which
is
not
a
general
statute
which
says
all
persons
abroad,
all
american
nationals
abroad
shall
be
subject
to
court-martial
but
as
a
specific
statute
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
page
three
of
the
government's
brief,
“a
specific
statute
which
covers
three
classes
of
persons,
persons
serving
with,
employed
by
or
accompanying,
the
armed
forces
overseas.”
in
covert
the
court
was
dealing
only
with
persons
accompanying
the
armed
forces
overseas.
it
was
not
dealing
with
persons
serving
with,
or
persons
employed
by.
immediately
under
that
in
the
government's
brief
there
is
the
separability
clause
which
as
the
court
will
see
is
a
very
explicit
one.
it
has
two
parts.
it
provides
that
if
a
part
of
the
act
is
invalid
other
parts
that
are
severable
shall
remain
in
effect
and
then
it
provides
that
if
a
part
of
the
act
is
invalid
in
one
or
more
applications,
the
remaining
applications
if
severable
shall
be
held
to
be
valid.
so
that
we
think
you
have
the
very
strong
direction
and
guidance
from
congress
in
this
very
explicit
separability
clause
and
you
will
also
have
the
very,
the
carefully
delimited
or
the
carefully
separated
phrasing
of
article
2
(11)
itself
into
different
categories
of
persons.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
it
clearly
applies
because
all
the
events
took
place
in
1957
after
the
act
went
into
effect.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
1954
is
when
he
went
to
--
to
a
--
to
serve
the
air
force
but
the
offense
took
place
in
june
1957
and
he
was
court-martialed
in
august
and
september
of
1957.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
grisham
case,
the
last
one
and
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
maybe
the
early
one,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
and
we
would
say
that
you
cannot
say
that
here
because
the
categories
of
the
people
are
different,
the
history
of
the
relationship
of
those
categories
to
military
jurisdiction
is
different.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
mr.
justice
and
i
am
here
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
doing
that.
one
further
thing
i
do
have
to
say
on
severability
is
that
there
is
a
long
and
different
history
of
those
serving
with
or
employed
by
the
armed
forces
from
those
accompanying
the
armed
forces
as
i
shall
try
to
set
forth
the
categories
of
serving
with
and
employed
by,
have
really
been
in
effect
for
over
two
centuries
in
explicit
terms.
and
they
were
in
effect
long
before
the
court
martial
law
revision
of
1916
or
the
court
martial
revision
of
1950,
but
it
was
only
in
1950
that
congress
explicitly
put
in
the
category
of
“accompany.”
so
you
would
have
to
say
that
congress,
in
putting
in
the
category
of
“accompanying,”
which
--
with
which
the
court
dealt
in
covert
wanted
also
if
that
turned
out
to
be
invalid
on
a
certain
application,
to
bring
down
also
the
old
jurisdiction
which
had
been
exercised
we
believe,
for
over
two
centuries
before
the
word
“accompanying”
was
inserted
in
the
court
martial
article
in
1916.
for
these
reasons,
we
don't
think
that
there's
really
any
substance
to
the
position
that
the
statute
is
so
inseparable
that
the
court
can
fail
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case.
and
there
is
no
other
issue
aside
from
severability
other
than
the
constitutional
issue.
our
general
position
on
constitutionality
is
that
this
statute
as
applied
in
this
and
the
succeeding
cases
stands
on
article
1,
section
8,
clause
14
of
the
constitution.
there
is
a
provision
for
congress
to
make
rules
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
i
shall
try
to
develop
that,
but
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
court
has
consistently
recognized
not
only
in
the
recent
cases
of
toth
and
then
mr.
justice
black's
opinion
in
the
covert
case,
but
in
the
earlier
hawaiian
court-martial
case
of
duncan
against
kahanamoku,
that
persons
who
are
not
members
of
the
armed
forces,
not
enlisted
or
commissioned,
do
not
wear
a
uniform,
can
be
covered
in
appropriate
circumstances
under
court-martial
jurisdictions.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it's
both,
mr.
justice.
people
who
are
employed
by
are
also
serving
with
but
the
reverse
is
not
true.
that
is
a
contractor-employee
would
be
serving
with
the
armed
forces
but
he
would
not
be
employed
by
the
armed
forces.
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
each
of
those
two
categories.
we
think
that
clause
14
is
sufficient
to
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
article
2
(11)
as
applied
in
this
case.
we
think
that
in
the
light
of
its
history
and
its
purposes,
it
is
unnecessary
to
invoke
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
but
we
would
invoke
it
if
it
were
necessary
to
do
so,
because
we
think
that
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
does
apply
to
the
court-martial
clause,
to
clause
14.
we,
of
course,
believe
as
the
court
indicated
in
covert
that
consideration
has
to
be
given
to
the
matter
of
jury
trial
and
to
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
and
that
the
constitution
has
to
be
considered
as
a
whole
in
determining
whether
article
2
(11)
is
valid
as
applied
in
this
and
the
other
cases.
and
we
have
three
bases
of
our
argument
that
the
constitution
does
permit
what
was
done
here.
and
the
first
is
the
historical
basis
with
which
i
shall
try
mainly
to
deal.
and
the
second
is
to
show
that
there
is
a
need
for
this
type
of
military
jurisdiction
in
the
world
today
with
american
bases
and
--
and
posts
overseas.
and
that
it
is
appropriate
to
subject
the
persons
in
these
cases
to
such
type
of
jurisdiction.
and
the
third
half
of
our
argument,
the
third
half
is
that
there
are
no
acceptable
alternative
methods
for
dealing
with
derelictions
and
crimes
committed
by
these
people.
on
the
matter
of
the
history
and
we
think
the
matter
of
history
is
significant
because
it
gives
content
to
the
constitutional
phrase
“land
and
naval
forces”.
we
think
you
determine
how,
what
land
and
naval
forces
meant
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted
and
what
it
means
today
by
seeing
the
history
as
it's
developed
since
the
17th
century.
and
i
should
like
at
the
beginning,
if
i
may,
to
give
a
general
picture
or
survey
of
what
we
think
the
history
shows.
i
have
four
points
to
make.
i'm
not
certain
i
will
be
able
to
develop
each
of
them
as
i
go
along,
but
i
would
like
at
least
to
put
before
the
court
the
four
general
points
that
i
think
are
important
in
this
case.
and
the
first
is,
that
from
at
least
the
middle
of
the
18th
century,
at
least
the
middle
of
the
18th
century,
there
has
been
what
i
think
is
a
consistent
legislation
practice
covering
court-martial
jurisdiction
of
a
service
connected
personnel,
service
connected
personnel
particularly
employees
of
the
type
involved
in
three
of
these
cases
but
not
solely
over
those
employees.
there's
been
legislation,
we
think,
for
two
centuries.
there's
been
consistent
practice,
not
every
year
but
over
the
period
of
time.
and
the
second
general
proposition
i'd
like
to
put
before
your
honors
is
that
there
was
no
general
hostility
at
the
time
before
the
constitution
was
adopted
and
at
the
time
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
and
after
the
constitution
was
adopted
to
this
type
of
court-martial
jurisdiction,
that
is
jurisdiction
over
service
connected
personnel.
there
was
hostility,
and
this
is
the
hostility
upon
which
our
opponents
rely
almost
exclusively.
there
was
hostility
to
the
notion
of
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
inhabitants
generally,
not
service
connected
personnel,
people
who
were
living
in
the
area
of
a
fort
or
a
garrison
or
around
hostilities.
there
was
hostility
to
that
kind
of
court-martial
jurisdiction,
but
there
was
no
hostility,
we
believe,
to
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
service
connected
personnel.
and
further,
there
was
actually
so
much
legislation
and
so
much
actual
practice
of
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
civilians
as
a
whole,
including
service
connected
personnel
witnesses
before
court-martial
and
even
inhabitants
generally,
particularly
in
times
of
hostilities
that
we
think
it
cannot
be
said
that
there
was
a
--
a
repugnance
or
a
rejection
at
the
time
of
the
constitution's
adoption
to
the
notion
of
civilians
being
subjected
to
court-martial
jurisdiction.
we
think
that
that
general
proposition
does
not
withstand
historical
analysis.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
do
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
a
plea
of
these
cases
do
involve
employees
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
but
we
do
not
draw
a
distinction.
we
think
that
there
are
much
--
many
more
of
greater
instances
of
actual
court-martial
jurisdiction
exercised
over
employees
and
there
are
many
more.
but
we
think
that
the
exercise
of
this
jurisdiction
also
goes
to
show
that
today,
jurisdiction
can
be
exercised
over
dependent
personnel
in
non-capital
cases
abroad
because
of
the
need
to
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
i
do.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
do
not,
mr.
justice.
again,
i
say
that
the
cases
we
have
here
are
those
employed
by
the
services.
but
we
think
the
history
does
not
draw
a
distinction
between
those
two
types
of
people,
but
again,
there
are
more
instances
of
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
personnel
actually
employed
by
the
services
than
by
over
other
people.
so
there
are
instances
of
many
instances,
i
think,
of
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
employees
of
settlers
and
other
people
who
are
not
directly
employed
by
the
government.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
nondependent
service
connected
personnel.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
was
coming
to
that.
yes.
that
--
that
--
if
i
may
say
that's
my
fourth
point
and
i
will
deal
with
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
my
third
point
is
--
if
--
i
would
like
to
stress
this
because
i
think
that
the
briefs
filed
on
the
other
side
particularly
the
colonel
weiner's
impressive
research
in
the
next
two
cases
may
obscure
the
fact
that
the
opponents
have
not
been
able
to
bring
forth,
we
believe,
one
single
affirmative
statement
of
the
18th
century
at
the
time
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
or
before
or
immediately
after
contrary
to
the
position
we
advocate
in
this
case
with
respect
to
service
connected
personnel.
i
repeat
that.
there
is
no
single
solitary
statement
that
we
know
of
that
withstands
scrutiny,
which
says
that
employees
and
service
connected
dependents
could
not
be
court-martialed
at
the
time
that
the
constitution
was
adopted.
there
are
general
statements
of
hostility
to
--
to
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
inhabitants
generally.
oh
yes,
there
are
many
of
those,
but
none
relating
to
the
particular
type
of
personnel
involved
in
this
case.
the
only
two
that
the
opponents
have
brought
forth
are
a
statement
by
lord
mansfield
reminiscing
about
a
matter
in
gibraltar
in
1738.
we
deal
with
that
in
our
reply
brief
which
has
been
filed
with
the
court.
and
we
think
we
show
that
in
addition
to
all
the
other
defects
at
the
time
lord
mansfield
was
talking
about,
the
british
parliament
had
not
given
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
the
--
over
that
kind
of
treatment
at
places
overseas,
but
it
did
some
years
later.
it
did
in
the
1750s
and
1765
and
since
that
time.
and
the
last
general
point
that
i
come
to
is
the
one
that
the
chief
justice
mentioned.
we
think
that
history
does
not
make
a
distinction
between
wartime
or
hostilities
and
peace
time.
we
think
that
what
the
history
shows
is
that
the
important
thing,
important
factors
were
two
-
the
direct
connection
of
the
person
with
the
armed
forces,
and
two,
the
need
for
exercising
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
him,
particularly
the
absence
of
civil
jurisdiction
at
that
place.
the
absence
of
civil
jurisdiction
runs
like
the
golden
thread
for
two
centuries
through
this
--
through
this
entire
history,
and
if
i
have
time
perhaps
tomorrow
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
there
was
no
civil
jurisdiction
there,
i
mean
if
civil
jurisdiction
was
present.
at
the
same
time,
they
had
the
statute
of
1765
which
provides
that
that
statute
to
which
your
honor
refers
did
not
apply
in
gibraltar
and
malta
and
other
places
beyond
the
seas
where
our
form
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
any
such
a
statute.
i
think
that
the
general
statute
of
1765
applied
that
is
where
our
form
of
civil
--
civil
judicatures
did
not
extend
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
all
times,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
all.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
there
was
no
form
of
civil
judicature
enforced.
that
is
if
there
were
british
magistrates
around
they
were
not
triable,
but
if
--
if
british
magistrates
had
not
gone
to
--
were
not
in
a
certain
section
of
the
region
they
were
not
triable,
they
were
triable
by
court-martial.
we
believe
that
that
is
the
--
the
real,
the
historical
antecedent
of
article
2
(11)
as
applied
to
situations
overseas
were,
of
course,
our
form
of
civil
judicature
does
not
extend.
going
back
to
the
question
that
chief
justice
asked
me,
we
think
that
it's
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
it's
on
page
33
--
page
33
and
53
of
--
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
of
our
opening
brief
in
number
21,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
am
not
arguing
--
i
am
not
arguing
the
next
two
cases,
mr.
justice.
mr.
green
is.
i
will
return
for
the
fourth
case.
and
perhaps
in
view
of
the
light
i
had
better
conclude
at
this
point
with
just
one
or
two
more
words
on
the
subject
of
wartime,
or
peace
time,
which
is
an
important
factor
in
this
case,
as
the
chief
justice
has
recognized.
and
that
is,
though
in
the
later
19th
century,
some
writers
and
even
some
of
the
judge
advocate
generals
themselves
interpreted
this
exception
for
which
i
am
arguing
as
relating
to
wartime
or
hostilities.
we
think
that
that's
a
mistake
in
nomenclature,
that
the
real
exception
is
the
need
for
exercising
the
jurisdiction
because
there's
no
civil
jurisdiction
present
at
the
time.
and
of
course
in
the
later
19th
century
when
these
writers
wrote
civil
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
extended
throughout
the
continental
united
states.
colonel
winthrop
and
the
others
did
not
envisage
what
would
happen
after
the
spanish-american
war
of
1898.
they
thought
that
since
american
civil
jurisdiction
covered
the
entire
continental
united
states,
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
exercising
this
in
the
field
type
of
jurisdiction
within
the
continental
united
states
because
there
were
courts
and
magistrates
everywhere.
i
wouldn't
--
i
do
not
believe
that
they
intended
to
foreclose
the
congress
from
adopting
the
historical
concepts
of
the
new
situation
which
they
didn't
foresee
but
which
arose
after
the
spanish-american
war,
and
particularly
after
world
war
ii
when
we
had
large
numbers
of
forces
stationed
in
technical
peace
time
overseas
that
didn't
exist
in
the
19th
century
in
any
extent.
and
i
think
that
the
--
those
decisions
and
those
writings
--
those
--
those
declarations
upon
which
the
other
side
relies
should
be
limited
to
the
situation
of
which
they
were
dealing
at
that
time.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
answer
to
that
is
this,
mr.
justice.
they
have
tried
many
noncapital
offenses.
they
had
not
tried
anywhere
near
the
number
of
trials
that
they
had
before
reading
and
(inaudible).
let
me
say
this.
the
number
of
offenses
has
continued.
they
have
not
decreased,
offenses
rather
than
trials
the
number
of
offenses
that
have
been
committed,
but
the
number
of
trials
has
decreased
because
the
armed
forces
have
exhibited
a
great
deal
of
restraint
in
the
--
in
the
bringing
of
these
cases
to
courts.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
in
most
cases
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
nothing
has
happened.
in
a
few
cases
they
may
have
been
tried
by
the
foreign
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
there's
been
no
policy
directive
within
the
department
of
defense.
when
this
case
came
up
it
was
decided
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
under
certain
guidance
from
washington
not
only
by
the
local
commander.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
have
decreased
considerably,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
it's
two
years,
a
little
over
two
years
since
the
covert
case
was
decided.
we
have
the
figures
from
1957
and
1958.
unfortunately
we
don't
have
figures
for
1959.
in
1957,
the
total
court-martial
prosecutions
were
76.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
of
civilians,
including
both
dependents
and
others.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
in
1958,
they
were
34.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
in
1956,
there
were
121.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
i
want
to
stress
--
i
want
to
stress,
mr.
justice
that
the
number
of
offenses
has
continued,
it
hasn't
even
increased.
we've
received
the
figures
on
the
number
of
offenses.
the
number
of
court-martials
has
decreased
but
not
the
number
of
offenses.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
would
say
generally
no,
sir.
some
of
them
may
have
been,
but
on
the
whole
they
were
not.
they
were
not
tried
at
all,
in
other
words.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
on
the
whole
they
were
less
serious
offenses.
there
was
one
homicide
in
which
we
waived
jurisdiction
to
the
german
governor.
they
may
have
included
larcenies,
mr.
justice.
when
i
say
--
less
serious
offenses,
i
can't
--
i
don't
mean
just
reckless
driving
or
exceeding
the
traffic
limit.
they
may
have
included
some
minor
larcenies
or
other
things
of
that
type,
but
there
were
no
--
certainly
no
capital
cases
and
no
homicides.
i
believe
i
did
let
--
let
go
unpunished.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
--
the
matter
was
under
serious
consideration.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
believe
not.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
believe
the
statutes
have
changed
at
all,
mr.
justice
since
the
covert
decision.
if
i
may
elaborate
a
bit
just
on
what
you
said,
they
did
--
consideration
was
given
to
these
subjects
within
the
department
of
defense.
as
i
understand
it,
the
solution
arrived
at
was
that
there
was
really
from
their
point
of
view
no
acceptable
alternative,
the
court-martial
jurisdiction
of
this
type.
and
that,
they
might
be
compelled
by
any
constitution
of
adjudication
to
seek
much
less
satisfactory
alternatives,
but
they
did
not
think
that
any
other
alternative
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
were
no
increases
in
--
in
military
jurisdiction
relating
to
civilians
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
know
of
no
effort
--
other
efforts,
mr.
justice,
unless
perhaps
you
referred
to
our
increased
efforts
to
do
historical
research
spurred
on
by
colonel
wiener's
on
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
would
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
have
just
one
point,
if
it
please
court.
colonel
wiener
stated
that
the
offense
itself,
the
substantive
offences
would
be
or
might
be
different
if
charged
under
the
law
of
war
than
charged
under
the
uniform
code.
i
don't
think
that's
quite
true.
the
law
of
war
recognizes
as
offences
all
those
acts
which
are
condemned
as
criminal
by
all
--
by
civilized
nations
generally.
now,
these
particular
offences
fall
in
that
category
because
all
50
states
of
the
union
and
about
15
or
20
countries
that
--
that
we
have
researched
condemn
this
type
of
conduct.
so,
it's
clear
the
offence
is
one
under
the
law
of
war.
now
how
the
offence
would
be
charged
is
--
is
a
procedural
question.
it
can
be
charged
in
one
or
three
ways
under
the
law
of
nations.
it
can
be
charged
either
particularized
in
terms
of
the
local
criminal
code
or
it
can
be
particularized
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
german
criminal
code
in
this
case
or
it
can
be
particularized
in
terms
of
the
common
law
of
war
as
such
by
taking
the
conglomeration
of
all
the
--
all
the
offences
and
all
of
the
civilized
nations
or
it
can
be
particularized
in
terms
of
the
regulation
of
the
occupying
power.
and
that
was
done
in
this
case
and
that
was
certainly
proper
since
the
person
who
was
involved
was
with
the
occupying
power.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
correct.
the
articles
would
be
applicable
there
too,
but
i
think
beyond
that,
the
offence
will
be
the
same
whether
they
would
be
charged
under
the
uniform
code
or
under
the
german
criminal
code
or
under
the
law
of
war
generally.
the
offence,
is
the
type
of
offence
where
the
--
where
the
code
has
very
little
room
for
particularization
beyond
what
was
done
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
that's
--
that's
what
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
say.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
now,
i'm
trying
to
say
is
you
have
to
establish
first
that
the
offence
is
one
which
is
cognizable
under
the
law
of
war.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
it's
not
cognizable
because
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
has
to
be
established
independently
depending
on
what
is
condemned
under
the
criminal
codes
of
civilized
nations
generally
and
once
that
is
determined
then
it
becomes
merely
a
matter
under
which
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
would
--
i
would
say
not,
because
it
would
not.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
article
18
is
the
one
we
depend
on.
it
states
that
a
court
martial
should
have
jurisdiction
to
prosecute
offence
under
the
law
of
war.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
what
is
contained
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
law
of
war
is
--
is
like
the
common
law
and
the
court
was
dealing
with
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it
is
like
the
common
law
used
to
be.
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
--
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
have
a
written
code.
it
is
--
it
is
a
common
law
which
has
grown
out
of
experience
and
out
of
the
practices
of
the
nation
of
the
civilizations.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that's
--
that's
incorrect.
all
those
--
all
those
places
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
that
is
all
50
states
of
the
union,
the
district
of
columbia,
puerto
rico
the
virgin
islands,
many
of
the
nations
of
the
world,
italy,
german,
france,
england,
canada,
india,
and
republic
of
china,
all
of
them
treat
this
as
a
criminal.
now,
it's
true
in
the
district
of
columbia
they
have
a
sexual
psychopath
act
and
persons
can
be
put
in
the
mental
--
at
the
hospital
under
the
sexual
psychopath
act,
but
that
is
not
in
lieu
of
criminal
punishment
for
these
types
of
offences.
the
charges
for
those
offences
remain
pending
and
technically,
the
person
can
be
prosecuted
after
his
--
if
--
if
--
after
he
is
cured
in
the
mental
hospital,
but
all
of
the
states
and
all
of
the
countries,
we
have
been
able
to
find
condemn
these
practices
as
a
violation
of
their
criminal
laws
and
punish
accordingly.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
--
it
definitely
says
--
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
has
traditionally
been
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
that's
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
article
18.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
what
this
court
said
in
the
quirin
case.
the
court
said
in
the
quirin
case
that
that
congress
could
crystalize
all
these
offences
by
cognizance
of
under
law
of
war
or
it
could
simply
adopt
the
law
of
war
as
it
exists
and
that's
what
they
have
done
then
and
that's
what
--
has
done
by
virtue
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
as
i
understand
it
by
the
adapting
the
law
of
war
as
such,
congress
has
in
effect
adapted
all
of
--
all
of
the
offences
which
are
properly
cognizable
under
the
law
of
war
as
offences
against
the
united
states.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
which
are
not?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
which
are
not
codified
