mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis
is
there
anything
in
the
nature
of
the
employment
or
in
the
duties
in
these
three
employees
that
would
cause
you
to
make
any
distinction
between
the
two
insofar
as
the
legal
principles
in
this
case
are
involved?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
three
employees.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
does
the
history
of
the
situation
make
any
distinction
between
the
type
of
hostility
up
to
this
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
extent,
mr.
davis,
have
the
prosecutions
decreased
since
covert?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
civilians.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
were
they
before
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
is
not
to
be
given
by
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
schuchat.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
schuchat
i
am
at
--
in
that
situation
all
you
have
is
a
statute
that
enumerated
certain
classes
of
people
who
were
subject
to
it
and
there's
no
question
as
to
those
people
that
was
--
the
statute
was
alright.
then
they
amended
the
statute
and
added
another
classification.
and
the
courts
held
that
that
additional
classification
was
bad.
would
that
--
would
that
negate
the
rest
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
we
not
stop
that
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
includes
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
and
i
don't
suppose
we
held
that
to
accompanying
him,
people
accompanying
him
were
not
--
not
included
in
the
statute
or
could
not
be
included
constitutionally.
did
that
necessarily
mean
that
the
others
could
not
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
reid
versus
covert
didn't
--
didn't
say
that
it
could
not
--
that
they
could
try
people
who
are
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
capital
offenses.
it's
fairly
limited
to
the
facts
we
have
there,
namely,
a
capital
offense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
there's
no
change
in
the
law
and
the
regulations,
but
there
was
a
change
in
the
situation
and
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
demanded
that
the
security
of
most
of
everybody
working
that
would
--
would
have
to
be
under
--
under
discipline.
would
the
army
have
the
right
to
discipline
him
under
those
circumstances
and
--
and
compel
him
to
come
and
go
only
when
they
said
so,
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
put
many
hours
as
the
--
as
the
government
of
the
army
required
or
do
a
lot
of
other
things
that
--
that
would
put
him
in
the
same
category
as
a
--
as
a
serviceman?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
is
it
likely
to
arise
anytime,
isn't
that
why
they
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
think
if
he
was
over
there
and
that
command
was
attacked
and
he
was
the
only
lineman
that
they
had
that
he
could
say,
â€œwell,
i'm
not
going
to
do
anymore
duty
as
a
lineman
and
leave
for
home?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
it
might
not
be
war.
it
might
race,
or
something
of
that
kind
to
fall
short
of
war,
but
it
might
--
it
might
call
for
a
very
tight
discipline
and
very
tight
security
for
all
who
are
connected
with
the
post.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
over
in
that
part
of
the
world,
they're
not
having
war,
but
they
are
having
race
on
the
time
which
i
read
in
the
newspapers
and
people
are
getting
injured
and
killed.
i
imagine
that
sometimes,
it
calls
for
a
very,
very
strict
discipline
on
the
part
of
the
personnel,
wouldn't
this
man
be
--
could
this
man
be
subject
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
discipline
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
before
the
--
working
for
the
army?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
he
be
telling
they
have
to
live
on
the
base?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that's
the
only
controlling
of
just
saying
either
--
either
you
live
on
the
base
or
you
quit
regardless
of
the
exigency
of
the
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
i
thought
--
that's
what
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
was
one
of
your
positions.

chief

finish

finish
your
statement.
