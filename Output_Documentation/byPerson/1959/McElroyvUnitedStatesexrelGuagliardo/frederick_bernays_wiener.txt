mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
deal
briefly
with
the
berlin
matter
and
then
take
up
most
of
my
time
on
the
2
(11)
argument.
the
petitioner
has
no
desire
whatever
to
involve
your
honors
in
the
berlin
crisis.
i
think
that
we're
bound
by
the
determination
of
the
political
department
that
berlin
is
occupied
territory
and
i
don't
question
for
a
minute
that
military
courts
can
function
in
occupied
territory.
in
madsen
versus
kinsella
teaches
that
the
president
acts
by
virtue
of
his
position
as
commander-in-chief
and
even
acts
through
military
agencies
or
civilian
agencies
as
he
deems
best.
i
don't
question
that.
our
position
is
that
this
wasn't
a
military
government
trial.
this
--
when
we
gave
up
the
occupation
in
west
germany,
we
gave
up
the
incidence
of
occupation
in
berlin.
there
are
no
occupation
courts
functioning.
they
have
never
functioned
since
may
5,
1955.
the
only
civilians
who
have
been
tried
have
been
the
accompanying
2
(11)
civilians
and
they
have
been
tried
under
2
(11).
now,
what
have
we
here?
we
have
here
a
collateral
attack
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribunal
of
limited
jurisdiction.
the
jurisdiction
of
that
tribunal
must
appear
on
the
proceedings.
it
is
not
necessary
to
prove
all
of
the
proceedings.
let
us
say
we
have
the
normal
court-martial
gusik
against
schilder.
if
on
court-martial
gusik
says
that
he
isn't
soldier,
you
say
i
am
private
company
a
of
the
29th
infantry,
you
haven't
proved
i
am.
you
didn't
prove
it
in
the
court-martial
record
then
on
collateral
attack
you
can
show
his
enlistment
papers.
in
other
words,
you
can
establish
on
collateral
attack
the
truth
of
the
necessary
jurisdictional
allegations
in
the
challenged
proceedings,
but
what
you
can't
do
is
to
change
the
record.
in
givens
v.
zerbst
in
the
255
united
states
it
was
very
plainly
said,
“nothing
being
done
here
changes
the
record.”
now,
what
the
government
is
attempting
to
do
here
is
to
sustain
the
jurisdiction
over
this
petitioner
on
a
ground
that
was
not
set
forth
in
the
proceedings
and
on
the
ground
that
wasn't
taken
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
represents
the
ultimate
views
of
the
military
judicial
system.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
think
it
could,
but
for
one
--
but
for
one
fact
i
think
it
would
be
discriminatory.
if
you
show,
if
you
show,
in
other
words
that
the
only
people
tried
under
article
18
is
limited
2
(11)
then
i
think
that'd
be
a
ground
for
saying
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
apart
from
that
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
think
there
was
because
it
was
occupied
territory.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
not
at
all.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
not
at
all.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
would
say
that
the
accused
wasn't
designated
because
it's
not
a
question
of
the
wrong
designation
because
the
military
law
is
the
same
if
you
alleged
the
wrong
article
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
the
question
is,
do
you
allege
facts?
and
it
isn't
whether
you
say
this
is
under
article
18
or
anything.
the
question
is
what
facts
do
you
alleged?
well
the
only
facts
alleged
were
that
this
accused
a
person
serving
with
employed
by
and
accompanying
the
armed
forces
without
the
continental
limits
of
the
us.
well,
that
was
article
2
(11)
in
its
earlier
pre-1957.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
think
you
would
have
had
to
say
a
person
subject
to
the
laws
of
war,
alright
and
that's
what
they
didn't
say.
and
you
can't,
you
can't
do
a
switch
when
you're
on
collateral
attack.
you're
bound
by
the
record
that
was
made
and
sustained.
also
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
what
about
the
allegations?
well,
now
there
are
normally
two
heads
of
jurisdiction
for
a
military
government
court,
three
heads.
one
is
the
laws
of
war.
let
us
say
spying
or
maltreating
the
occupying,
interfering
with
the
functions
of
the
occupying
body.
and
then
there
is
--
the
laws
of
war
of
the
local
laws
which
are
being
violated.
and
then,
there
would
be
any
local
ordinances
of
the
occupying
power
as
in
--
what's
that
case
from
puerto
rico,
neely
versus
henkel.
neely
violated
an
order
of
the
american
commander
in
puerto
rico,
but
here
the
allegation
is
that
he
violated
certain
provisions
of
the
uniform
code,
which
by
those
terms
are
limited
to,
that
is
they
make
punishable
conduct
by
a
person
subject
to
this
code.
so
that
you
just
don't
find
within
the
four
quarters
of
the
document
anything
to
establish
the
jurisdictional
basis
requisite
on
collateral
attack.
in
other
words,
they
haven't
--
it
was
only
when
they've
got
up
here
that
they
made
the
big
drive
to
try
to
see
if
they
could
sustain
it
as
something
which
it
never
was
from
the
beginning.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no.
they
would
not.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
he
would
have
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
he
would
have
to
be
charge
with
the
(inaudible)
for
berlin
or
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
war.
now
these
somewhat
pathological
offenses
with
which
he
was
charged
won't
be
found
in
groceries
or
bad
tailor
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
yes.
in
other
words,
there
are
three
headings
of
possible
jurisdiction.
one
violation
of
the
common
law
of
war
shooting
prisoners,
sniping
at
the
troops,
any
interference
with
the
occupation,
second
violation
of
the
municipal
law,
murder,
any
of
the
more
conventional
offenses,
and
third,
violation
of
the
occupying
commander's
orders,
curfew
for
instance,
that's
all.
but
when
you
particularized
it
by
saying
that
this
is
a
violation
of
an
article
of
a
code
which
in
terms
makes
punishable
only
conduct
by
persons
subject
to
the
code,
you
have
what
this
started
out
to
be
and
what
it
finished
out
pass
in
the
military
system
a
prosecution
under
the
uniform
code
for
someone
under
2
(11)
and
that
brings
us
to
2
(11).
now,
i
want
to
take
up
as
i've
indicated
in
the
previous
argument
the
government
said
in
1957
there
is
no
difference
between
civilian
employees
and
civilian
dependents.
it's
a
question
of
state.
in
time
of
peace
--
in
time
of
war
and
in
the
field
there
is
no
question,
but
not
in
time
of
peace.
and
i
would
like
to
go
into
that
much
of
views
field
of
history
and
i
propose
to
cover
all
of
it.
there
maybe
some
dispute
whether
the
sampling
technique
helps
the
posters
arrive
at
accurate
predictions.
that
is
disputed,
but
there's
no
dispute.
there
can
be
no
dispute,
but
the
sampling
technique
is
not
adapted
to
historical
generalizations.
and
i
will
try
to
touch
all
the
points.
now
i
think
and
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
what
makes
this
so
long.
it's
mostly
history.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
but
there
is
no
consistent
practice
in
what
was
subjectively
regarded
as
time
of
piece
of
trying
accompanying
civilians,
but
apart
from
a
number
of
essentially
episodic
instances
many
of
which
were
flagrantly
and
palpably
illegal
on
their
face.
now
in
the
continental
army,
yes,
civilian
employees
were
tried.
well,
there
is
a
classic
example
of
--
in
time
of
war
in
the
field
then
there
were
other
civilians
tried
by
the
army
for
what
appeared
to
be
war
offenses.
the
government
cited
one.
i
found
about
34
additional
and
also
found
that
as
washington's
writing
shows
these
people
were
not
tried
on
the
articles
of
war
but
on
the
results
of
congress.
and
then
the
government
says,
“well
those
are
all
irrelevant.”
well,
considering
that
they
started
with
the
first
one,
i
think
that's
a
little
unfair.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
unkind
because
here,
i
did
their
homework
for
them
but
at
any
rate,
this
was
a
war
time
jurisdiction.
it
was
not
time
of
peace.
now,
do
we
have
any
expressions,
contemporaneous
expressions
of
what
the
policy
and
the
thinking
was
around
that
time?
and
the
answer
is
yes.
in
1765,
the
british
parliament
passed
an
act
and
this
was
the
infamous
parliament
that
passed
the
stamp
act,
they
passed
the
mutiny
act
for
north
america
in
which
they
said
that
anybody
found
in
this
vast
western
wilderness
which
was
just
been
conquered
from
the
french
who
commits
offenses
shall
be
apprehended
by
the
officer
commanding
his
majesty's
troops
and
forthwith
taken
into
the
nearest
settled
province
or
colony
there
to
be
dealt
with
according
to
the
law
of
that
colony
as
though
his
offense
have
been
committed
there
and
the
only
right
the
misgrant
laws
was
the
right
of
venue
in
a
place
where
there
weren't
many
people.
all
right,
1787,
the
11
of
july,
two
proposals
come
before
the
continental
congress.
one
is
the
first
draft
of
the
northwest
ordinance
and
the
second
is
the
report
by
the
secretary
at
war,
general
knox
saying,
“there
are
a
lot
of
people
here
in
the
northwest
territory
who
were
committing
depredations
against
indians
and
that
starts
indian
wars.
i
suggest
that
we
try
and
punish
these
people.
i
have
the
military
officer,
the
commander
of
the
troops
try
and
punish
these
people.”
two
days
later,
the
northwest
ordinance
was
passed.
the
knox
report
went
to
a
committee
and
the
committee
said,
“well,
let
us
have
these
offenders
against
the
indians
tried
by
court-martials
subject
to
the
law
of
martial
as
though
they
were
enlisted
soldiers.
well,
that
was
passed
to
another
committee
and
the
other
committee
came
back
and
said,
well,
ordinarily,
yes,
civil
offenses
should
be
dealt
with
by
the
civil
magistrate
but
until
a
civil
government
is
established
and
crimes
are
punished
by
anybody
who
injures
the
indians
should
be
tried
by
court-martial
as
though
he
were
an
enlisted
soldier.
and
that
rested
in
the
file
and
no
action
was
taken.
in
other
words,
even
though
there
was
to
be
a
hiatus
of
14
months
because
the
first
governor
didn't
take
over
for
a
year
and
no
crimes
act
was
passed
in
the
northwest
territory
for
another
two
months.
in
preference
to
military
jurisdiction
over
civilians,
congress
preferred
a
hiatus
of
law
and
order.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
was
a
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
was
a
generalized
military
jurisdiction,
yes.
now,
mr.
davis
said
yesterday,
there
is
no
affirmative
statement
in
the
debates
and
in
the
ratifying
conventions
to
the
effect
that
land
and
naval
forces
doesn't
include
military
trials
of
the
accompanying
civilians.
well,
i
think
the
notion
that
land
and
naval
forces
meant
trying
civilians
in
time
of
peace
was
just
too
fantastic
to
have
occurred
to
anyone
as
little
bit
like
they
all
saw
the
boy
who
complains
to
his
mother.
“but
mommy,
you
didn't
tell
me
i
shouldn't
put
beans
in
my
ears.”
nobody
could
think
of
anything
so
fantastic.
and
if
they
had
looked
in
number
83
of
the
federal
list,
hamilton
said
trial
by
jury
remains
unimpaired.
well,
that
brings
us
to
the
1790s
and
i
found
in
the
manuscripts
in
my
appendix
d
a
number
of
trials
of
civilians
under
the
aegis
of
general
wayne
and
general
wilkins,
most
of
them
under
general
wayne.
well,
now
of
course,
the
1790s
and
terms
of
our
concepts
were
a
time
of
peace.
in
terms
of
the
concepts
of
the
mid
19th
century,
they
were
a
time
of
peace
except
where
the
indians
were
actually
being
shot
at
out
in
the
northwest
territory.
but
then
in
studying
the
military
cases
in
the
1790s,
i
came
across
something
that
puzzled
me
because
under
aw
2
of
1786,
any
death
sentence
in
time
of
piece
had
to
be
referred
to
congress
until
1796.
and
yet,
in
these
records
manuscript
and
otherwise,
i
find
that
general
wayne
ordered
death
sentences
into
execution
in
the
1790s
before
the
transfer
of
power
came.
and
i
thought,
how
can
he
do
that?
was
he
disregarding
the
articles
of
war?
when
they
reported
it
to
knox,
the
secretary
of
war
incidentally,
well,
i'll
come
to
that
later
and
knox
was
a
man
who
went
strictly
according
to
the
book
in
military
matters.
and
then
i
went
through
the
statutes
at
large
and
the
journals
of
the
continental
congress
and
the
state
paper,
is
there
anything
that
transferred
the
power
from
the
congress
to
the
commanding
general
to
execute
these
death
sentences
in
the
field?
and
i
didn't
find
anything
and
the
only
way
that
those
executions
would
have
been
legal
would
have
been
in
time
of
war
and
then
the
light
dawned.
they
thought
it
was
a
time
of
war
and
secretary
of
war
pickering
who
succeeded
knox
said
in
1795,
since
the
commencement
of
the
indian
war,
the
united
states
have
been
in
a
situation
that
excluded
the
idea
of
its
being
a
time
of
peace.
in
other
words,
putting
ourselves
into
the
minds
of
the
people
of
the
1790s,
they
thought
--
they
thought
it
was
a
time
of
war.
so
that
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
most
of
them
beforehand,
most
of
them
beforehand.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
after
greenville,
after
greenville,
there's
no
question
it
was
time
of
peace
and
after
that,
you
get
only
episodic
cases.
and
you
get
the
sort
of
lawlessness
that
wilkinson
perpetrated
at
detroit
where
a
man
committed
an
offense
that
was
denounced
by
an
act
of
congress
and
wilkinson
issued
an
order
against
him
and
he
was
just
a
citizen
unconnected
with
the
military.
and
he
tried
him
by
court-martial
and
had
him
lashed
with
a
wired
cat
of
nine
tails.
now
those
things
are
just
plainly
illegal.
you
have
anthony
wayne
in
setting
up
a
military
opa
in
pittsburgh
because
the
market
is
forestalled.
and
this,
at
a
time,
at
a
time
when
washington
was
enjoining
on
the
military,
their
narrow
functions,
and
the
government
says,
“oh
well,
but
wayne
was
the
superior
military
authority.
he
was
the
highest
officer
there
was.”
yes,
he
was
the
highest
military
officer
but
there
was
a
secretary
of
war
and
there
was
the
president
and
what
wayne
did
in
many
of
these
instances
was
just
palpably
illegal.
many
times,
where
the
civil
courts
were
functioning,
certainly
nothing
--
certainly
nothing
from
which
you
can
derive
the
threat
that
the
government
seeks
to
find
that
it's
alright
when
the
civil
courts
aren't
functioning.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
that
the
1790s
or
perhaps
referred
top
those
cases,
the
persons
tried
were
not
shown
to
have
any
kind
of
connection
with
the
military.
and
of
course
these
instances
make
understandable
what
is
recorded
in
the
chronicles
of
the
times,
the
state
of
endemic
conflict
between
the
civil
authorities
and
the
military.
then
between
1798
and
1858,
we
get
from
that
60-year
mountain,
mouse
of
seven
trials
of
civilians.
in
five
of
those
seven
instances,
the
civil
courts
were
open
in
the
vicinity
so
that
i
say
that
was
flagrant
disregard
of
proper
boundaries
and
his
history,
not
the
kind
of
history
infused
in
the
constitution,
but
the
kind
of
history
which
consists
of
the
recital
of
past
abuses.
we
then
come
to
the
civil
war.
judge
advocate
general
holt,
whose
peculiarly
genius
gave
us
the
military
commission
for
political
opponents
which
was
disposed
of
in
the
milligan
case
and
also
that
sad
monument
to
passion
the
trial
of
the
lincoln
conspirators
which
nobody
really
likes
to
mention.
and
then
with
the
war
over
and
holt
retired,
the
question
arose
in
1877
and
then
when
the
attorney
general
momentarily
lapsed
and
said
“civilian
employees
could
be
trailed
by
court
martial,”
it
was
the
judge
advocate
general
who
rushed
into
the
breach
and
reminded
the
civil
power
of
the
limitations
on
military
authority.
all
those
opinions
are
set
forth
in
appendix
c
and
that
same
paradox,
if
the
court
please,
continues
today.
the
strongest
statement
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
military
trials
of
civilians
in
time
of
peace
is
in
the
pages
of
winthrop,
a
man
for
--
who
always
a
mature
life
was
a
professional
soldier.
and
the
most
vehement
arguments
in
favor
of
that
jurisdiction
are
presented
here
in
this
court
(inaudible)
cases
are
the
civil
rights,
division
of
the
department
of
justice.
in
other
words,
the
military
man
is
anti-militarist
and
the
civil
rights
division
is
anti-civil
rights.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
these
briefs
and
these
cases
were
prepared
by
and
signed
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
and
the
acting
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
civil
rights
division.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
they
were
assigned
to
that
division.
what
i
think
is
the
--
i
--
i
--
well,
they
got
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
he's
got
the
--
of
course
he's
got
to
defend
it,
but
it's
--
it's
a
funny
--
it's
a
funny
kind
of
civil
rights
that
instead
of
giving
substance
and
content
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
starts
hacking
away
at
the
sixth.
now,
these
discussions
in
1877
are
most
interesting
because
they
are
really
the
most
--
the
first
articulated
and
reasoned
discussion
of
the
constitutional
problem
and
really
they
lasted
for
some
time
and
they
were
followed
shortly
thereafter
by
the
case
of
the
post
trader.
now,
the
post
trader
was
the
successor
to
the
supplement.
winthrop
who
lived
contemporaneously
with
both
said
so.
the
statutes
providing
for
the
post
trader
purported
to
make
him
subject
to
the
articles
of
war.
and
so
the
question
was
asked
if
the
judge
advocate
general,
“can
the
post
trader
be
trailed
by
court
martial?”
and
he
held
in
an
opinion
that
was
published
in
three
successive
additions,
”no,
there
is
no
military
jurisdiction
over
the
post
trader
except
in
time
of
war
on
the
actual
theatre
of
the
indian
war.”
now
that
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
no
more
than
was
the
sutler.
he
was
an
independent
contractor
who
made
his
living
selling
goods
to
the
soldiers.
in
other
words,
he
is
the
--
he
is
the
direct
successor
of
the
sutler
who
was
mentioned
in
the
articles
way
back.
now,
that
ruling
was
first
mentioned
three-and-a-half
years
ago
and
finally
--
finally
three
--
now,
in
the
reply
brief,
the
government
admits
its
acceptance
and
then
you
can
see
why
it
took
him
three-and-a-half
years
to
formulate
an
answer.
there
isn't
any
answer
and
even
what
they
say
is
directed
not
to
what
was
published
for
three
successive
additions
in
print,
but
to
an
abstract
in
the
archives.
and
that
is
why
basically
i
have
said
that
i
cannot
take
too
seriously
as
an
historical
text
they
rather
selective
presentation
made
by
my
brother.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
judge
advocate
general
crowder
went
to
congress
in
1916,
and
asked
for
the
2d
jurisdiction
and
it's
one
of
the
great
mysteries
of
that
1916
revision
why
he
never
mentioned
winthrop's
opinion
which
had
been
on
the
books
for
20
years
saying
it
was
on
unconstitutional.
why
he
never
mentioned
the
opinions
in
the
1912
digest
of
opinions
that
it
just
been
issued
under
his
own
supervision.
that
to
me
is
the
great
mystery.
now,
looking
at,
he
apparently
proceeded
on
one
articulated
premise,
namely
this
thieving
quarter
master
clerk
who
got
away
on
the
second
occupation
of
kilburn.
that's
what
he
had
on
his
mind.
insofar
as
i
tried
to
extract
these
legal
premises,
he
thought
first
that
the
constitution
stopped
at
the
water's
edge,
that
there
were
no
constitutional
protections
overseas,
which
of
course
is
law.
he
also
thought
that
the
fifth
amendment
cases
arising
in
the
land
of
naval
forces
was
a
source
of
military
jurisdiction
and
while
that
did
had
judicial
support
at
that
time,
it
was
of
course
exploded
by
talk.
and
the
--
the
mystery
of
the
sixteenth
revision
is
why
didn't
--
if
crowder
had
said,
“well,
i've
looked
into
this
gentlemen.
i
think
that
my
distinguished
predecessor
colonel
winthrop
was
wrong,
i
think
this
is
alright
for
such
and
such
reasons”
then
we'd
be
in
a
different
situation,
but
it
was
never
discussed.
so
then
we
come
back
to
our
starting
point,
namely
that
military
jurisdiction
is
a
question
of
status.
without
military
status,
there
is
no
military
jurisdiction
in
time
of
peace.
without
military
status,
there
is
jurisdiction
in
time
of
war
only
in
areas
in
the
field.
now,
on
practical
necessities,
here
again
i
think
the
government's
arguments
would
carry
more
weight
if
there
were
fewer
omissions.
i
think
it's
pretty
well
admitted
that
there
hasn't
been
any
attempt
to
restudy
this
problem
beyond
--
well,
let's
see
if
we
can't
get
read
the
covert
limited
and
future
litigations.
they
haven't
even
plugged
the
very
obvious
gap
which
is
that
the
espionage
chapter
of
title
18
of
the
code
would
not
apply
to
a
civilian
employee
in
an
overseas
military
headquarters
committing
espionage
violations,
that
very
obvious
gap
for
which
it
could
be
thrown
back
and
tried
in
a
district
court
in
the
first
district
in
which
he
was
found
or
brought,
the
espionage
act
would
not
cover,
an
act
of
espionage
by
an
american
civilian
in
an
overseas
military
headquarters.
they
haven't
even
plugged
that
yet
and
they
haven't
explained
why
it
is
that
these
civilians
haven't
been
militarized.
well,
the
court
of
hearing
show
and
the
appropriation
here
is
a
budgetary
reason
and
then
take
--
take
this
petitioner
and
his
connection
and
the
connection
of
his
offences
with
the
military.
he
was
found
guilty
he
was
charged
with.
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
substance
of
seven
sex
offences.
if
they'd
been
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
only
area
where
congress
legislates
the
order
of
--
had
a
hearing
under
the
sexual
psychopath
act,
he
would
be
placed
in
saint
elizabeth.
instead
of
which,
he
is
trailed
by
court
martial.
he
is
sentenced
to
five
years
confinement.
it
isn't
going
to
cure
him
and
it
isn't
going
to
protect
society
and
here
was
an
employee
who
are
--
an
auditor
who
offered
to
resign.
now,
what
is
an
auditor
so
significantly
got
to
do
with
our
military
mission?
again,
the
gerard
case,
if
it
was
proper
to
turn
gerard
over
to
the
japanese,
why
isn't
so
improper
to
turn
this
person
over
to
the
german
courts
in
berlin?
we
certainly
trust
the
german
courts
and
we
could
have
authorized
them
to
handle
this.
now,
i
don't
have
to
spend
time
on
the
proposition
that
necessity
is
not
a
constitutional
argument,
but
here
they
haven't
even
made
a
showing
of
necessity.
it
is
expediency
and
it's
the
expediency
of
doing
things
on
the
cheap,
because
it
would
cost
less
money
to
have
these
persons
as
civilians
when
they
have
them
in
the
service.
and
i
submit
that
is
not
a
sound
ground
for
cutting
down
constitutional
protections
or
for
watering
down
the
scope
the
sixth
amendment.
and
from
this
it
follows,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
judgment
below
refusing
to
release
this
petitioner
to
be
reversed.
