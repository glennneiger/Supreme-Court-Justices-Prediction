were
any
local
civilians
involved?
justice
william

douglas
didn't
england
at
the
time
or
about
the
time
of
the
american
revolution,
i'm
a
little
hazy
on
this,
but
didn't
they
have
a
statute
that
forbade
the
british
law
jury
from
trying
in
military
courts,
civilians
in
the
british
army
who
were
stationed
in
this
country?
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
america,
purely
american
precedents
i
remember
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
times
of
peace.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
all
times.
justice
william
o.
douglas
civil
employees
of
the
british
army
in
america
were
not
tried
--
triable
by
the
military,
british
military,
isn't
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
known
that
british
statute
where
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
--
i
understood
your
brief
saying
occupation
courts
in
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
where's
that
article
18?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
i
found
it.
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
thing
is
about
peace
time
trial
like
court-martial?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
for
that
purposes
doctrine
of
madsen
applies
in
1956.
justice
william
o.

relief.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i
read
your
footnote
13,
the
berlin
is
not
--
is
not
an
occupied
territory.
it's
--
it's
by
the
--
your
executive
order
--
i
haven't
read
the
executive
order
but
the
one
you
cite
there
seems
to
take
berlin
out
of
the
occupied
zone.
so
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
responsibilities
were
vested
by
the
president
and
the
chief
of
united
states
diplomatic
mission.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
that
--
that's
an
end
to
military
government
and
i
thought
that
madsen
was
based
upon
military
government.
maybe
i
haven't
read
it
recently
but
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
was
--
it
was
our
military.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
troops
are
here
at
fort
mcnair,
they're
everywhere
to
this
country
but
that
doesn't
make
us
a
--
under
the
military
government.
i
don't
get
this
--
you
shock
me
as
to
what
i
apparently
agreed
to
in
madsen.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
didn't
know
we
had
a
question
for
the
policy
here.
this
--
this
involves
the
rights
of
american
citizen
to
be
tried
by
one
tribunal
over
another
and
i
thought
(inaudible)
in
madsen
was
that
this
was
a
military
government
in
control
and
i
thought
the
military
government
had
ended.
may
--
maybe
i'm
wrong?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
haven't
read
mr.
weiner's
brief.
i
just
looked.
he
does
say
(inaudible)
petitioner's
trial
by
court-martial
cannot
be
sustained
as
an
exercise
in
military
government
jurisdiction
over
him,
of
course,
he
can
speak
for
himself,
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
he
realized
that
we
had
a
military
government
still
in
berlin
and
i
thought
it
was
a
shock
to
me.
