mr.
harold
h.
greene
may
it
please
the
court.
although
the
government
is
respondent
in
this
case,
under
stipulation
that
was
approved
by
the
court,
we
will
argue
first.
this
case
arises
out
of
denial
by
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado
of
a
habeas
corpus
petition
filed
by
this
petitioner.
this
court
granted
certiorari
prior
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
in
1956,
this
petitioner
was
working
in
berlin
as
a
civilian
employee,
as
an
auditor
for
the
comptroller
division
of
the
berlin
command.
he
was
then
living
in
american
government's
quarters
built
with
occupational
funds.
on
june
22nd,
1956,
he
was
arrested
and
served
with
three
charges
for
the
total
of
seven
specifications.
first
charge
of
two
specifications
of
indecent
act
with
children
under
16
years
of
age,
the
second
charge
is
three
specifications
of
sodomy,
and
the
third
charge
had
two
specifications
of
display
of
obscene
pictures
to
children
under
the
age
of
16.
he
was
tried
on
these
charges
and
at
the
trial,
he
objected
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
on
the
ground
that
he
was
a
civilian
and
therefore
not
amenable
to
the
court-martial
jurisdiction
and
his
objection
was
overruled.
he
pleaded
guilty
and
was
found
guilty
accordingly.
he
was
given
a
sentence
of
10
years
imprisonment
which
was
subsequently
reduced
to
five
years.
the
judgment
and
the
sentence
were
approved
by
the
convening
authority
by
the
board
of
review
and
by
the
court
of
military
appeals.
now
while
the
petitioner
was
serving
a
sentence
at
fitzsimons
army
hospital
near
denver,
he
brought
this
habeas
corpus
action
and
the
district
court
denied
the
petition
on
the
ground
that
article
2
(11)
was
constitutional
as
applied
in
this
case.
this
case
is
largely
like
the
first
case,
the
guagliardo
case
that
was
argued
by
mr.
davis,
first
in
the
series
since
this
petitioner
like
guagliardo
was
a
civilian
employee
accused
of
a
noncapital
offense,
but
in
this
case,
and
we
--
of
course
we
rely
on
all
the
arguments
made
in
that
connection,
but
here,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court-martial
can
be
sustained
and
yet
the
different
and
alternative
ground.
and
that
is
that
the
court-martial,
the
trial,
constituted
an
exercise
of
the
war
powers
of
the
congress
as
expressed
in
article
18
of
the
uniform
code.
that
article
provides
in
substance
that
a
general
court-martial
should
have
jurisdiction
to
try
any
person
who
by
the
law
of
war
is
subject
to
trial
by
military
tribunal.
as
madsen
against
kinsella
shows
under
the
law
of
war
any
person
living
in
territory
occupied
by
the
united
states,
including
american
civilians
is
triable
by
a
military
court.
now
petitioner
in
this
case
concedes
and
--
one
that
berlin
is
presently
under
military
occupation
for
all
purposes
and
secondly
of
military
trials
may
validly
be
held
in
that
type
of
territory,
and
the
question
that
he
raises
is
that
this
petitioner
was
not
tried
on
the
theory
that
he
was
subject
to
the
war
powers,
but
he
was
tried
on
the
theory
that
he
was
a
person
employed
by
in
the
armed
forces
under
article
2
(11)
and
that
therefore
the
government
cannot,
said,
change
it
to
jurisdictional
theory
at
this
point
in
the
case.
you
might
say
it
was
raised
previously
before
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
before
the
district
court.
now
it
must
be
clearly
understood
that
there
is
no
dispute
here
about
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
power.
the
petitioner
as
i
understand
the
concession
agrees
that
the
court-martial
had
power
to
try
him
under
article
18
that
is
under
the
will
powers
of
the
congress.
the
only
question
is
whether
procedurally,
that
power
was
exercised
in
this
case
by
the
drawing
of
the
charges.
now
initially,
since
the
--
since
power
has
deemed
to
exist
and
has
been
conceded
to
exist,
it's
our
position
that
this
is
not
really
a
matter
for
the
civil
courts
of
law.
the
civil
courts
will
review
military
judgments
only
to
determine
whether
they
were
totally
void
for
one
of
power
not
whether
procedural
irregularities
might
have
existed
in
the
cause
of
the
--
in
the
cause
of
the
exercises
of
the
power.
procedural
questions
are
for
the
military
courts
and
for
military
law.
and
the
fact
that
the
proposition
that
only
procedural
questions
and
military
questions
are
involved,
i
think
it's
shown
by
the
fact
that
petitioner
in
his
brief
relies
wholly
on
military
law
and
military
decisions
to
show
that
the
exercise
power
he
was
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
your
honor,
the
--
what
the
man
--
what
the
court-martial
manual
provides
is
this.
that
where
a
charge
is
brought
in
the
article
18
under
the
war
power,
the
charge,
the
specification
alleging
the
acts
would
be
the
same,
the
acts
which
constituted
the
offense.
now
the
charge
part
of
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes.
that
--
that
--
that
charge
is
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
the
introductory
recital
would
be
different.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well
what
the
manual
specifically
provides
is
that
if
the
charge
is
brought
under
article
18,
the
charging
party
introductory
clause
should
state
that
this
offense
is
a
violation
of
the
law
of
war
or
that
the
offense
is
a
violation
of
the
law
of
war
be
--
and
that
it
is
an
offense
under
the
local
criminal
code.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
the
allowable
punishment
would
not
be
different.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
we
can
see
of
no
consequences
that
would
be
different
in
any
way.
one
of
our
points
is
that
petitioner
could
not
be
prejudiced
in
any
way,
whatever
by
this
change
in
the
introductory
designation
or
the
charges.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i
don't
know
but
of
course
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
introductory
clause
did
provide
that
this
was
a
violation
of
article
--
of
the
article
125
and
134,
whatever
the
article
happen
to
be
rather
than
the
--
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
law
of
war.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
the
--
it's
little
more
complicated
than
that
i
think.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
the
manual
provides
that
what
should
be
charged
if
an
article
18
jurisdictional
statement
is
made,
it's
a
violation
of
the
law
of
war.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
article
18,
i
believe
is
at
page
4
of
our
brief
in
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no,
the
singleton
brief
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
the
wilson
brief
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
page
4,
i
believe.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it's
the
last
--
last
clause
on
--
in
that
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it
enumerates
all
the
offenses
which
are
properly
cognizable
under
the
law
of
war
and
if
--
if
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
war
power
is
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
as
i
understand,
that
will
admit
the
argument,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
there
are
no
occupation
courts
as
such,
no
courts
that
which
--
which
are
designated
occupation
courts
in
which
do
nothing
but
try
that
type
of
--
it
has
that
type
of
jurisdiction.
but
of
course,
under
article
18,
a
court-martial
is
permitted
to
exercise
the
role
of
an
occupational
court
of
military
commission
on
occupation
court
would
be
the
same
thing.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
article
18
is
at
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it's
the
last
sentence
where
it
is
--
it
is
relevant
here.
now
i
might
say
this
too
that
under
the
manual
while
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no.
it
has
to
do
with
--
the
law
of
war
as
the
madsen
case
i
think
shows
applies
not
just
in
war
time,
but
applies
in
occupied
territory.
and
in
the
madsen
case,
it
was
stated
specifically
that
the
power
to
punish
offenses
arising
under
the
law
of
war
does
not
expire
with
the
cessation
of
hostilities
but
continues
during
the
occupation.
mrs.
madsen
was
tried
in
germany
during
the
occupation
long
after
the
war
had
--
the
germany
had
finished.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well
the
doctrine
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
the
doctrine
of
madsen
applies
in
berlin
because
berlin
is
--
as
occupied
today
as
germany
--
as
west
germany
was
when
mrs.
madsen
was
tried.
and
as
i
say
the
--
there
is
no
dispute
about
that
fact
so
far
as
petitioner
is
concerned.
now,
i
want
to
say
this
to
--
if
we
have
any
misunderstanding.
while
the
manual
provides
that
the
introductory
clause
of
the
charges
should
charge
that
a
violation
of
the
law
of
war
had
occurred,
the
manual
also
provided
if
instead
of
charging
a
violation
of
the
law
of
war
a
specific
article
is
alleged
to
have
been
violated
as
here
article
134
and
125,
this
would
not
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court-martial.
so
under
military
law
itself,
the
manual
of
court-martial
has
provided
that
this
type
of
pleading
that
was
--
that
was
filed
in
this
case
would
be
perfectly
sufficient
to
charge
an
offense
--
to
charge
a
jurisdictional
basis
for
the
trial
of
the
offenses
both
under
the
2
(11)
clause
and
under
article
18.
now,
i
might
say
too
that
the
military
law
has
been
authoritatively
stated
by
the
case
of
united
states
against
schultz
in
which
the
court
of
military
appeals
was
confronted
with
precisely
this
same
situation.
there
a
--
an
employee
of
an
officer's
club
in
japan
was
tried
on
the
theory
that
he
was,
of
course,
employed
by
the
armed
forces
and
therefore
amenable
to
court-martial
jurisdiction
under
article
2
(11).
it
was
--
the
court
held,
the
court
of
military
appeals
held
that
this
jurisdiction
could
not
be
sustained
under
article
2
(11)
because
he
was
not
in
fact
employed
by
the
armed
forces.
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
japan
was
occupied
territory,
the
court
said
that
jurisdictional
although
specifically
laid
under
article
2
(11)
could
be
sustained
under
the
war
powers
of
the
congress
the
same
as
we're
contending
here.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
the
mere
fact
that
the
agent
of
the
occupation
is
the
ambassador
doesn't
alter
the
fact
of
occupation.
we
had
the
same
situation
in
germany
where
the
--
where
the
powers,
the
occupying
powers
were
exercised,
not
by
a
general
of
the
army
but
by
high
--
by
a
civilian
high
commissioner
and
still
germany
was
held
to
be
occupied
territory.
in
other
words,
territory
maybe
occupied
by
the
american
forces
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
senior
official
who
exercises
the
power
of
occupation
is
a
civilian
rather
than
a
military
person.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no.
i
don't
think
madsen
was
rested
specifically
on
military
government.
it
rested
on
the
fact
of
occupation.
in
other
words,
it
depends
on
who
has
sovereignty
in
that
area.
the
sovereignty
in
west
germany
at
the
time
of
the
occupation
was
not
that
of
the
german
federal
republic,
it
was
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it
was
our
--
it
was
the
united
states,
whether
it
was
military
or
civilian,
the
united
states
was
exercising
full
powers
in
germany
just
as
the
united
states
is
exercising
powers
at
the
present
time
in
berlin
rather
than
the
german
city
government.
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
the
allied
kommandantura
is
composed
of
the
three
powers,
but
the
three
powers
have
the
ultimate
sovereignty
since
they
have
the
power
at
anytime
the
countermand
the
veto
and
to
change
any
of
the
regulations
that
may
be
passed
by
the
berlin
city
government
and
they
have
the
ultimate
authority
in
berlin
to
prescribe
regulations
of
their
own
and
they
would
supersede
and
to
that
extent
void
anything
that
might
be
passed
by
the
local
government.
efforts
were
made
at
the
time
when
the
bonn
constitution
was
adapted
in
west
germany
to
make
that
constitution
applicable
to
berlin.
but
at
that
time,
the
three
western
powers
made
a
reservation
to
the
bonn
constitution
making
it
quite
clear
that
the
bonn
constitution
could
not
apply
in
berlin
because
the
three
powers
wanted
to
preserve
in
berlin
their
rights
of
occupation
which,
of
course,
they
assert
now
in
international
negotiations
all
over
the
world
as
united
states
is
contending
now,
that
we
are
in
fact
occupying
berlin
as
a
legal
proposition.
and
it's
true
that
they're
not
only
occupying
its
legal
proposition,
the
troops
are
there.
there
is
a
general
who
is
in
charge
of
the
occupying
troops
in
berlin
although
the
technical
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
the
--
i
don't
think
the
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
the
--
it
cannot
be
based
on
the
fact
as
to
who
the
senior
official
happens
to
be.
the
mere
fact
that
the
senior
official
happens
to
be
at
the
same
time
the
ambassador
of
the
united
states
and
bonn
and
also
the
--
the
senior
official
so
far
as
the
berlin
government
is
concerned,
that
can't
--
i
don't
think
that
can
be
the
test
of
whether
berlin
is
an
occupied
territory
or
not.
berlin
is
occupied
by
the
united
states
by
virtue
of
the
fact
the
united
states
exercised
ultimate
power
there.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it
is
not
in
controversy
as
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
as
i
understand,
that
the
petitioner
concedes
that
berlin
is
occupied
territory
for
all
purposes.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
the
position
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
as
i
say.
as
i
--
as
i
interpret
the
cases
not
just
madsen
of
course
and
the
other
cases,
the
fact
which
gives
rise
to
an
application
of
the
law
of
war
is
the
fact
of
occupation
where
the
government
is
military
government
or
civilian
government
in
the
sense
that
the
ultimate,
the
highest
official
is
a
high
commissioner
or
an
ambassador
rather
than
an
army
general,
doesn't
alter
the
fact
of
occupation.
if
the
fact
of
occupation,
the
fact
as
to
--
as
to
the
sovereignty
which
is
being
exercise
by
the
united
states
there
in
berlin
as
occupied
territory
which
really
determines
the
applicability
of
the
law
of
war.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
he
does
not
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no,
i
--
but
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
now,
i'd
like
to
say
this
too
that
aside
from
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
as
i
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i
don't
want
to
interpret
what
his
brief
means
but
as
i
understand
that
he
does
not
contest
the
fact
of
occupation
or
the
fact
of
military
trials
could
be
had
there.
his
point
--
his
point
simply
is
that
that's
not
what
was
done
in
this
case,
that
we
didn't
try
this
petitioner
under
the
law
of
war.
we
tried
him
under
article
2
(11)
as
a
person
employed
by
the
armed
forces
and
that
is
according
to
the
petitioner
the
vice
and
the
defect
in
this
proceeding.
now,
a
second
point
is
made
by
the
petitioner
and
that
is
that
the
fact
that
only
connected
civilians,
persons
connected
with
the
armed
forces
--
with
the
occupation
forces
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no
your
honor,
in
most
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no,
your
honor.
he
is
most
of
that
brief
is
devoted
to
the
problem
of
where
this
was
a
proper
exercise
of
jurisdiction
under
article
2
(11)
whether
this
person
was
an
employee
of
the
armed
forces.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
if
we
can,
we
can,
if
we
can
sustain
the
jurisdiction
under
either
of
the
two
theories,
in
other
words,
assuming
that
we
are
correct
that
on
this
procedural
point,
he
could
be
tried
under
article
18
then
it
doesn't
really
make
any
difference
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
is
my
understanding,
yes
your
honor.
now
if
we
are
correct
in
that,
then
we
need
never
to
determine
whether
he
is
also
correct
or
incorrect
on
the
basis
of
article
2
(11).
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
is
correct.
this
is
an
alternative
argument
that
this
could
be
sustained
as,
jurisdiction
here
it
could
be
sustained
in
either
on
the
article
2
(11)
if
guagliardo
is
decided
in
the
government's
favor
or
if
guagliardo
was
decided
against
the
government
then
we
say
that
the
jurisdiction
can
be
sustained
under
article
18
in
any
event.
now,
the
subsidiary
point
that's
being
made
in
connection
with
the
article
18
argument
with
the
argument
that
he
was
being
tried
here
under
the
law
of
war
is
that
to
try
him
in
that
fashion
was
denial
of
due
process
in
that,
not
all
persons
in
berlin
are
presently
being
tried
by
military
courts.
the
only
persons
admittedly
who
are
being
tried
by
military
courts
--
well,
are
persons
who
are
actually
in
uniform
and
persons
who
are
connected
with
the
armed
forces
as
employees
or
dependents.
and
the
allied
kommandatura
law
number
seven
which
is
here
involved,
this
is
a
third
category
of
persons
who
might
commit
offenses
against
the
allies
or
against
the
military
authorities
there.
so
it
is
said
that
this
is
an
unlawful,
unjust
discrimination
to
single
out
this
category
of
service
connected
civilians
of
civilians,
of
employees
and
dependents
who
are
there
with
there
with
the
american
armed
forces
single
them
out
for
a
trial
under
this
war
power
under
article
18
and
not
to
try
all
of
the
civilian
population
of
west
berlin,
including
american
tourists
and
any
other
persons
who
might
come
there.
it
seems
to
us
that
even
if
the
due
process
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
read
into
the
due
process
clause,
if
it
could
be
applied
in
that
type
of
situation
as
broadly
as
it
would
here
and
i
think
the
quirin
case
and
the
yamashita
case
goes
undoubtedly
in
that
proposition.
even
in
that
event,
a
case
of
unlawful
discrimination
has
not
been
made
out
historically
and
throughout
the
ages.
persons
who
were
actually
with
the
occupying
force
either
as
soldiers
or
persons
employed
by
the
occupying
force
have
been
exempt
from
local
criminal
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
the
occupied
country.
winthrop
recognizes
this.
other
text
writers
have
recognized
this.
this
has
been
the
practice
throughout
the
ages
and
therefore
this
type
of
discrimination,
this
kind
of
distinction
that's
being
made
with
the
persons
connected
with
the
occupation
who
were
tried
in
the
courts
of
the
occupying
power
and
other
persons
who
were
not
connected
with
the
occupation
who
were
being
tried
in
the
local
courts
seems
to
us
is
--
cannot
be
construed
as
unlawful
discrimination
in
violation
of
due
process
even
--
given
that
concept
the
very
broader
scope
that
could
be
imagined.
