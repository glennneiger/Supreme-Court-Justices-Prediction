justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
everybody
who
works
for
the
army
in
the
united
states
and
elsewhere?
justice
hugo
l.
black
original
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wonder
if
--
may
i
ask
this
question?
i
assume
that
there
are
121
cases
that
should
have
been
tried
each
of
these
years
of
1957
and
1958,
were
the
difference
between
121
and
34
kinds
in
the
courts
of
the
jurisdiction
in
which
these
people
were
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
army
made
a
recommendation
to
congress
that
it
has
authorized
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
made
any
recommendation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
in
the
meantime
broadly
increased
the
laws
that
they
have
and
the
arguments
in
favor
of
military
trials
as
opposed
to
civilians?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
aren't
there
if
there
was
(inaudible)
as
i
understand
it
in
the
direction
not
try
evidence
of
crime
by
civilian
code
but
to
increase
the
arguments
and
improve
the
opportunities
when
expanding
the
military
forces
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
tells
that
increase
in
jurisdiction
that
they
have
not,
but
you
say
they
considered
it
and
they
reached
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
alternative
except
the
trial
by
the
army.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference?
is
he
subject
to
military
court-martial
in
violations
of
the
military
law
yet
that
they
do
not
now
have
a
law
that
allows
the
army
to
try
the
persons
(inaudible)
could
not
do
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
were
saying
is
that
he
has
the
right
now,
in
the
law
(inaudible)
can
go
fishing
if
he
wants
to
and
he
could
also
not
work,
but
if
the
army
has
the
right
as
court
martial
subject
to
military
law,
that
wouldn't
make
him
subject
to
same
kind
of
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
the
offense
--
the
day
it
happened
that
--
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
should
be
considered
as
to
whether
he
should
be
--
whether
he
can
be
considered
and
subject
to
court-martial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
amended
the
regulations
and
provided
that
--
that
he
is
subject
to
the
punishment
and
we
have
two
words
as
we
have
it
(inaudible)
and
that
he
has
to
be
there
in
a
certain
hour,
if
he
doesn't
come
within
time
then
he
is
court-martialed.
would
that
change
his
present
status
from
the
arguments
you've
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
fact
you
would
say
--
you
would
say
then
that
he'd
be
the
same
as
an
enlisted
man
and
everything
but
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
he
have
a
written
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
not
in
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
far
as
the
record
shows
if
he
sends
the
employee
at
will
now
--
now
or
immediately
he
starts
working
(inaudible)
working
months?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
is
that
the
status
he
appears
to
be
in
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
because
of
civil
service?
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
he
be
under
civil
service?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
(inaudible)
as
long
as
you
can
provide
but
you
can't
(inaudible)
provided
the
soldiers
are
these
for
three
years.
if
they
are
in
the
civilian
realm
i
don't
think
that
--
that
the
time
will
be
(inaudible)
is
drawing
the
distinction
here
if
that
should
be
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
sovereignty
exercise
in
there
by
the
united
states
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
binding
on
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
suppose
the
war
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
brief
--
special
brief
by
the
civil
rights
division
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
an
article
of
war
that
says
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
doesn't
quite
say
that.
the
difficulty
at
a
rather
early
date
it
was
held
that
common
law
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
argument
--
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
understand
your
argument
on
this
point
is
based
on
the
fact
that
there
is
no
prohibition
written
by
congress
in
the
articles
of
war.
no
statute
against
this
saying
as
a
crime,
but
that
you
say
that
the
court
you
should
look
to
the
civilized
nations
of
the
world
in
order
to
sustain
a
conviction
to
this
man
for
a
crime
which
congress
have
not
described.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
that
the
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
that
the
court
has
held
that
both
admiralty
and
as
to
the
common
law
of
crime
while
there
is
an
admiralty,
a
body
of
law,
i
have
understood
it
to
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
an
intimation
of
body
of
law,
could
not
--
could
not
be
enforced
in
this
country
unless
it
had
been
adapted
in
this
country
as
a
statute,
as
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
say
that.
that
just
means
to
say
that
that
is
a
law,
either
by
the
court
under
the
definition
of
the
rule
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
are
not
codified
in
the
words.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
codified
anyway.
