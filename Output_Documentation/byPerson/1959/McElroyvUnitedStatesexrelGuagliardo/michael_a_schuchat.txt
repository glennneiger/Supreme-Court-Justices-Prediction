mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
in
this
case
because
it
is
not
possible
to
separate
the
unconstitutional
portion
of
the
statute
from
what
remains.
now
in
--
at
page
1
of
our
brief
is
set
forth
article
2
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
i
say
that
because
it's
not
set
forth
at
any
place
else
in
full.
and
on
page
2
of
the
brief
is
subparagraph
(11)
which
is
the
provision
involved
in
this
case.
subparagraph
(11)
is
plain
and
unambiguous
and
in
order
to
retain
it,
in
view
of
the
covert
decision
it
is
necessary
to
insert
word
for
the
word
“attention”
into
the
language.
it
is
necessary
to
insert
after
the
words
“accompanying”
a
phrase
saying
“except
in
capital
offenses.”
you
cannot
severe
the
--
the
statutory
provision
by
construing
a
word
in
the
certain
way
or
by
deleting
words.
now
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
versus
reese
and
numerous
other
cases
holds
that
inserting
words
in
the
statute
is
prohibited
since
this
is
legislation.
it's
not
a
matter
of
enforcing
the
old
law,
but
you
would
be
writing
a
new
law.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
yes
sir.
the
--
further,
when
you
consider
the
congressional
intent,
we
feel
that
the
--
it
would
seem
clear
to
us
that
congress
would
not
want
the
remaining
portion
of
subparagraph
(11)
enforced.
as
the
court
of
appeals
put
it,
the
legislature
would
not
be
satisfied
with
what
remains.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
well,
concededly,
it's
only
through
inference,
but
i'd
like
to
say
first
of
all
the
covert
decision
numerically
removed
95%
of
the
people
made
subject
to
subparagraph
(11)
when
they
were
charged
with
the
most
serious
offenses.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
no
your
honor,
there
are
more,
there
are
455,000
dependents
but
only
25,000
civilian
employees.
so
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
well
i
--
i'm
sure
there
are.
the
--
there
is
--
i've
never
seen
the
specific
breakdown
but
of
course
the
--
the
capital
cases
are
fewer,
but
the
number
of
people
which
were
removed
when
they
were
charged
with
the
capital
offense,
95%
of
those
have
been
removed
by
the
covert
decision
and
it
would
seem
--
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
would
not
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
because
they
are
civilian
dependents.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
no
your
honor,
you're
not
wrong
there,
but
i'm
--
there
are
two
points,
the
people
who
are
subject
to
the
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
no,
your
honor.
now
in
addition,
if
there
is
a
congressional
intent
shown
through
the
statute
in
the
legislative
history
then
all
of
the
people
covered
by
subparagraph
(11)
should
be
treated
uniformly.
and
this,
as
a
result
of
the
covert
case,
you
cannot
do.
and
further,
the
government's
argument
in
large
part
of
these
cases
is
based
upon
the
practical
necessity
for
having
court-martial
jurisdiction.
now
the
practical
necessity,
it
seems
to
me,
varies
from
place
to
place
and
depending
upon
the
crime
involved.
it
is
one
thing
to
say
it's
necessary
to
have
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
a
wife
or
an
employee
in
england,
let
us
say,
and
it's
quite
a
different
thing
there
than
it
would
be
say
in
antarctica.
similarly,
the
government's
arguments
for
having
court-martial
jurisdiction
to
try
a
civilian
dependent
or
employee
for
traffic
violation
are
quite
different
if
a
security
violation
were
involved.
these
reasons
--
these
policy
considerations
in
how
you
would
redraft
subparagraph
(11)
are
of
course
appropriately
left
to
congress.
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
this
case,
congress
has
furnished
no
guide
and
no
criteria
as
to
how
the
statute
should
be
broken
down.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
an
appropriate
case
for
the
following
the
rule
never
to
decide
a
constitutional
question
unless
absolutely
necessary.
such
a
decision
by
this
court
would
leave
the
congress
free
to
rewrite
the
legislation
and
include
criteria
which
were
related
more
definitely
to
the
security
and
discipline
and
effectiveness
of
the
armed
forces.
but
turning
now
to
the
--
however
to
the
constitutional
question,
the
government
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
would
but
i'
rather
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
no.
no
we
don't
because
the
provision
where
congress
has
said
who
was
subject
to
the
code
are
some
12
categories
and
it's
--
it's
simply
one
subparagraph
that's
involved
here.
and
the
--
by
coding
what's
not
severable,
you
don't
do
anything
to
the
remaining
categories
in
article
2
or
anything
else
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
it's
simply
this
subparagraph
(11)
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
persons
serving
with,
employed
by,
or
accompanying
the
armed
forces.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
no,
your
honor
but
that
is
not
the
effect
of
reid
versus
covert
because
reid
versus
covert
doesn't
strike
out
the
word
accompanying.
reid
versus
covert
adds
to
a
--
that
is
how
you
have
to
read
it.
you
have
to
insert
after
accompanying
except
in
capital
cases.
you
see,
you've
--
you
have
to
insert
the
words
of
limitation
in
subparagraph
(11)
to
confirm
it
to
reid
versus
covert.
if
reid
versus
covert
had
said,
“you
couldn't
try
persons
accompanying”,
then
you
are
--
your
honor's
question
is
quite
true.
you
would
just
be
striking
the
word
“accompanying”,
but
that
isn't
the
situation.
you
have
to
insert
words
of
limitation
into
subparagraph
(11)
to
retain
it.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
yes,
your
honor
i
--
i
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
well
i'm
taking
the
--
reid,
that's
quite
true
and
of
course
my
position
on
this,
that
you
can't
deprive
the
others
either,
but
on
limiting
reid
versus
covert
to
the
narrowest
ground
did
not
show
that
there
were
six
justices
concurring
in.
now
turning
now
to
the
--
to
the
constitutional
issue,
the
government
refers
in
its
briefs
to
the
uniformed
personnel
and
seems
to
imply
that
the
distinction
between
guagliardo
and
a
member
of
these
services
is
that
he
doesn't
wear
a
uniform.
at
the
outset,
let
me
say
this
is
but
a
small
facet
of
the
distinction
and
probably
the
least
significant
is
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
wear
a
uniform.
in
almost
all
of
his
relationship
to
the
air
force,
guagliardo
was
different
from
airman.
from
the
very
beginning
as
a
civilian,
when
he
is
employed
by
the
air
force,
he
takes
an
oath
to
discharge
the
duties
of
the
office
of
--
on
which
he
is
about
to
enter.
but
airman
that
enlists
in
the
air
force,
he
takes
an
oath
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
president
and
officers
appointed
over
him
according
to
regulations
under
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
now
guagliardo
was
in
morocco
because
he
wanted
to
go
to
morocco.
he
went
there
on
his
own
private
transportation
with
an
ordinary
passport.
an
airman
in
morocco
was
in
morocco
because
the
air
force
sent
him
to
morocco
and
he
came,
of
course,
by
government
transportation
without
a
passport.
in
morocco,
guagliardo
lived
in
the
city
of
casablanca
in
a
private
apartment
just
the
same
as
any
other
civilian
in
casablanca.
the
airman
lived
on
the
base.
i
should
point
out
that
casablanca
is
by
no
means
analogous
or
comparable
to
the
frontier
or
the
wilderness
cited
in
much
of
the
government's
argument
of
the
early
--
these
early
cases.
casablanca
is
a
modern
city.
it
has
courts,
policemen,
it's
a
--
and
the
nouasseur
air
depot
is
in
proximity
to
casablanca
very
much
as
the
washington
national
airport
is
to
the
city
of
washington.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
i
--
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
--
i
imagine
at
some
places
there
are
though.
i'm
sure
that
some
places
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
no.
the
--
i
think
the
--
you
have
to
examine
the
whole
relationship.
now
of
course
the
airman
is
paid
a
monthly
salary
and
the
salary
is
uniform
throughout
the
world.
guagliardo
was
paid
an
hourly
rate.
he
got
overtime
and
actually
his
wage
rate
varies
from
place
to
place
throughout
the
world.
the
government
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
the
--
guagliardo's
duties
were
the
same
as
an
enlisted
man
in
the
air
force.
now
i,
of
course,
concede
that
the
air
force
has
electricians,
has
enlisted
men
who
are
electricians
that
would
do
the
same
sort
of
thing
as
guagliardo,
but
these
enlisted
men
had
considerably
other
duties
to
perform.
besides
being
an
electrician,
they
are
military
people.
they
march
and
they
drill
and
they
prepare
to
fight
as
the
--
as
the
commander-in-chief,
the
president
has
promulgated
the
code
of
conduct
which
says
that
they
are
american
fighting
men,
ready
to
give
their
life
in
defense
of
their
country.
now
you
can't
say
that
about
guagliardo.
guagliardo
was
over
there
to
work
as
an
electrician.
it's
quite
a
different
relationship.
probably
the
most
significant
part,
distinction
between
guagliardo
and
an
enlisted
man
is
that
an
enlisted
man
or
anyone
in
the
service
is
constantly
under
restraint.
he
cannot
come
and
go
as
he
pleases.
if
he
wants
to
leave
the
base,
he
has
to
get
permission.
guagliardo
on
the
other
hand
has
a
job.
he
comes
to
work
from
shall
we
say
9
to
5.
outside
of
that,
his
life
is
his
own.
he
isn't
regulated
by
the
air
force
whereas,
contrasted
to
that
the
airman
in
the
air
force
is
regulated.
continually
he
is
regulated
and
he's
continually
under
restraint.
he
has
to
have
permission.
if
guagliardo
decided
he
wanted
to
go
fishing,
he
goes
fishing.
there's
no
civil
or
criminal
liability
attached
to
it,
he
simply
takes
--
takes
off
and
loses
a
day's
pay.
if
an
enlisted
man
decides
he
wants
to
go
fishing
for
one
day,
he's
absent
without
leave
or
he's
possibly
guilty
of
desertion.
and
of
course,
guagliardo
could,
at
any
time,
quit.
an
enlisted
man
cannot
quit.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
well
i
don't
know
how
he
could
desert
--
he
doesn't
have
that
relationship
that
--
that
he
could
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
well
possibly,
they
could
but
they
would
be
--
he
would
no
longer
be
--
he
would
have
the
same
status
that
he
--
that
he
has
now.
he
would
no
longer
simply
be
working
for
the
--
for
the
air
force.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
probably.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
no.
i'm
saying
this
shows
that
he
doesn't
have
the
relationship
to
the
air
force
such
that
he
should
be
considered
the
same
as
though
he
were
an
enlisted
man.
the
government's
argument
is
that
although
he's
not
a
member
of
the
air
force,
he's
so
intimately
connected
and
his
relationship
with
them
is
such
that
he
should
be
constitutionally
in
the
same
position
as
though
he
were
an
enlisted
man
in
the
air
force.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
what
it
would
seem
to
me
it
would.
it
would
--
it
would
change
him
into
an
enlisted
man.
i
--
probably
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
well
if
--
if
you
add
a
few
more
things
to
that,
you
are
making
him
into
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
but
he
isn't.
he
--
he
doesn't--
he
doesn't
agree
that
he
will
abide
by
the
orders
and
the
regulations.
all
he
says
he's
going
to
do
what
he
--
joins
what
he
--
when
he
goes
to
work
is
that
he's
going
to
work
as
an
electrician.
he
doesn't
agree
to
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
i
--
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
believe
there
is
a
civil
service
form
which
he
signs
when
he
starts
work.
this
--
it's
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
he
--
it's
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
that's
the
same
form
signed
by
all
civil
service
employees
everywhere
not
simply
abroad.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
yes,
sir,
except
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
except
that
as
he
may
have
certain
rights
of
--
under
civil
service,
but
that
is
he
might
have
certain
reemployment
rights.
the
air
force,
i
believe,
could
fire
him
at
anytime
but
he
--
because
of
a
reduction
in
force
in
morocco,
but
i
--
he
may
have
certain
rights
to
get
reemployed
elsewhere
if
there
were
a
--
there
were
a
position
open.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
that's
because
of
civil
service.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
yes
sir.
he
has
a
wage
board
classification
and
he's
a
--
has
permanent
civil
service
status.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
well
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
well
that
--
they
--
such
a
situation
might
arise
and
the
government
might
say
that,
but
he
could
quit
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
no
i
don't
think
so.
if
those
situations
arose,
he
would
be
still
be,
as
a
civilian
he
can
quit.
he
can
--
the
army
or
the
air
force
could
say,
“now
if
you're
going
to
work
here
as
an
electrician,
you
have
to
do
one,
two,
three,
four.
and
if
he
was
going
to
continue,
he
might
have
to
do
those
things,
but
he
could
quit.
he
could
say
well
in
that
case,
i
don't
want
to
be
an
electrician
here.
i
want
to
go
some
place
else
and
there
is
nothing
that
air
force
could
do
to
him
and
that's
the
big
distinction
between
guagliardo
and
an
enlisted
man.
an
enlisted
man
can't
say,
“i
don't
want
to
do
it.”
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
no
sir,
because
that
would
be
time
of
war.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
well
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
time
of
war
category,
for
instance
at
pearl
harbor,
it
didn't
wait
until
congress
declared
war
the
next
day.
the
civilians
were
subject
to
court-martial
right
away
and
i
think
the
same
situation
will
be
true
in
the
--
the
same
would
be
true
in
the
situation
you
pose.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
well
that
now
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
now
i
think
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
i
think
that
the
answer
is
this.
there's
one
thing,
of
course,
the
base
commander
has
authority
to
regulate
things
on
the
base.
the
base
commander
could
say,
“if
you
can't
--
we're
going
to
have
a
blackout
here”
where
he's
going
to
turn
their
lights
out
or
something
like
that.
that's
one
thing,
but
it's
quite
a
different
thing
to
say
that
the
civilian
employee
can
be
tried
by
court-martial
for
not
obeying
it.
the
--
i
--
the
base
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
well
--
he
could
make
it
a
condition
of
his
employment.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
right.
so
long
as
the
exigencies
did
not
amount
to
war.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
because
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
--
because
you're
transforming
him
into
what
i
conceive
to
be
a
civilian.
that
that's
of
the
essence
of
being
a
civilian
is
that
he
can
quit
and
if
you're
--
you're
--
you're
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
recess
yesterday,
i
was
pointing
out
the
fact
that
a
soldier
cannot
quit
whereas
a
civilian
employees
such
guagliardo
has
the
privilege
of
quitting
his
employment.
and
mr.
justice
black
in
part
what
the
situation
would
be
if
there
were
enlistment
at
will
rather
than
enlistment
for
a
fixed
term.
now
the
--
of
course
as
the
hypothetical
question
changes
the
facts,
but
even
in
that
situation,
a
soldier
would
be
subject
to
discipline
and
would
have
--
have
to
obey
orders
whereas
his
situation
would
be
different
from
guagliardo
who
was
simply
an
employee.
the
relationship
of
guagliardo
to
the
service
is
simply
an
employer-employee
relationship.
in
fact
until
after
world
war
ii,
it
was
never
thought
that
the
relationship
was
such
that
it
should
subject
him
to
court-martial
jurisdiction.
illustrative
of
that
is
the
decision
of
this
court
in
duncan
versus
kahanamoku.
in
that
case
which
involved
the
military's
power
to
court-martial
in
hawaii
in
time
of
war,
that
petitioner
duncan
was
a
civilian
employee
of
the
navy
who
was
a
ship
bidder
at
the
navy
yard
at
pearl
harbor.
he
was
--
and
precisely
--
had
precisely
the
same
status
as
guagliardo.
the
other
petitioner
was
a
civilian
stockbroker,
named
white.
now
white's
crime
was
embezzling
some
stock
belonging
to
another
civilian.
duncan's
crime
was
engaging
with
--
in
a
brawl
with
the
marine
sentry
at
the
gate
of
pearl
harbor
navy
yard.
this
court
said
that
they
were
both
civilians
not
connected
with
the
service
and
entitled
to
the
rights
of
civilians.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
navy
could
not
court-martial
duncan
in
time
of
war
in
hawaii
then
certainly
the
air
force
cannot
court-martial
guagliardo
and
morocco
in
time
of
peace.
now
i
will
pass
over
the
historical
problem
because
i
think
it's
necessary
to
read
the
historical
material
cited
in
the
briefs.
i
don't
have
a
time
here,
but
if
--
i
think
that
when
read
the
materials,
you
will
be
convince
that
there
is
no
historical
precedent
for
this
type
of
jurisdiction,
but
essentially
the
government's
case
is
predicated
on
necessity.
they
say
that
the
practical
necessity
overrides
everything
else
and
justifies
the
jurisdiction.
our
position
is
that
the
necessity
is
irrelevant,
but
assuming
that
the
necessity
is
considered,
the
government
has
not
made
out
a
case
of
necessity
such
as
would
justify
this
extraordinary
jurisdiction.
the
government's
case
for
necessity
is
based
primarily
on
the
replies
which
it
received
from
various
military
commanders
throughout
the
world
which
were
reprinted
in
one
of
its
briefs
in
the
covert
case.
and
this
--
these
replies
are
adopted
again
in
this
case.
now
if
you
examine
the
replies
of
the
various
military
commanders
whose
--
which
are
printed
in
those
briefs,
you
will
see
that
the
primary
problem
which
they
have
consists
of
black
market
offenses
and
traffic
offenses.
this
is
--
this
is
over
80%
of
the
number
of
crimes.
now
it's
obvious
that
a
traffic
offense
is
a
problem
of
the
host
country.
it's
a
violation
of
a
host
country's
laws
and
will
be
prosecuted
by
the
host
country.
similarly,
black
market
offenses
are
violations
of
the
host
country's
laws.
they're
probably
not
even
a
violation
of
the
united
states
law
and
they
will
be
prosecuted
by
the
host
country.
of
course,
the
united
states
is
concerned
that
our
people,
any
american
abroad
not
violate
the
law
and
that
we
are
concerned
with
the
economic
condition
of
our
allies
where
we
have
troop
stationed,
but
this
is
not
primarily
the
concern
of
the
defense
department
and
it
certainly
should
not
give
rise
to
court-martial
jurisdiction.
now
the
government
then
points
to
cases
such
as
security
cases,
involving
classified
information.
these
cases
are
obviously
extremely
rare.
they
can
very
easily
be
prosecuted
in
the
united
states.
i
say
that
they're
rare
not
because
i
have
the
figures,
because
the
figures
have
never
been
made
known,
but
if
they
were
of
any
real
concern
to
the
defense
department,
the
defense
department
after
the
covert
decision
would
have
gone
to
congress
and
would
have
had
the
slight
change
in
the
statute
which
was
probably
necessary
to
make
them
triable
in
the
united
states.
and
in
addition,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
offense
involving
disclosure
of
classified
information
abroad
is
so
serious
that
it
should
be
tried
in
an
article
3
court.
now,
the
government
also
contends
that
cases
involving
only
united
states
citizens
or
only
property
of
the
united
states
will
not
be
tried
by
the
host
country.
they
say
that
the
host
country
won't
be
interested
in
it.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
is
this
is
proven
in
the
very
cases
which
were
before
this
court
now.
in
guagliardo,
the
crime
involved
stealing
property
of
the
united
states.
the
morocco
nationals
who
were
charged
with
the
conspiracy
were
tried
by
the
moroccan
government.
certainly,
disapproving
the
thought
that
they're
allies
are
not
interested
in
people
who
steal
from
the
united
states.
so
far
as
crimes
involving
only
americans,
the
--
the
facts
in
the
grisham
case,
which
is
the
fourth
case
before
your
honors,
will
show
that
the
french
government
was
--
was
quite
reluctant
to
let
the
american
military
try
them
and
had
grisham
not
been
court-martial,
he
would
have
certainly
been
tried
by
the
french
government.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
there
--
there
was
--
such
sentiment
of
course
was
voiced
in
congress
not
at
the
time
that
uniformed
code
of
military
justice
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
--
was
passed.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
there
was
and
i
agree
that
it's
quite
chauvinistic
in
the
--
i
will
point
out
in
this
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
no
sir.
i
would
point
out
to
your
honor
that
so
far
as
morocco
was
concerned,
in
1956,
the
united
states
government
with
congressional
approval
gave
up
its
consulate
court
in
morocco
subjecting
all
for
the
first
time.
subjecting
americans
to
moroccan
courts
and
it
would
seem
to
me
this
happened
in
1956.
it
would
seem
to
me
the
government
cannot
now
come
in
and
somehow
say
that
the
moroccans
dispense
an
inferior
brand
of
justice,
and
it's
wrong
to
subject
the
americans
to
moroccan
courts
because
we
could
very
easily
have
retained
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
yes
your
honor,
but
--
but
it's
indicative
that
the
moroccan
justice
was
not
so
inferior
as
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
that
is
not
in
the
record,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
the
--
the
government
also
has
no
explanation
for
why
employees
of
the
defense
department
abroad
should
be
treated
differently
from
other
employees
of
the
united
states
abroad.
foreign
nationals
who
were
employed
by
the
defense
department
abroad
and
there
are
a
very
large
number,
the
government
disputes
to
figure
of
a
188,000
which
i
found
in
the
congressional
record,
but
in
any
event,
it's
a
very
substantial
number.
these
people
do
precisely
the
same
work
as
many
--
as
guagliardo
and
many
others.
they
have
the
same
access
to
our
basis
as
guagliardo
does
and
the
government
has
no
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
them.
and
the
government
--
the
armed
forces
abroad
are
able
to
carry
out
their
function
and
carry
out
their
mission
without
this
court-martial
jurisdiction.
similarly
there
are
large
numbers
of
americans
employed
by
other
agencies
of
the
united
states.
the
--
the
figure
from
the
congressional
record
is
60,000
which
the
government
says
is
inflative,
but
in
any
event
it's
a
very
large
number.
these
other
departments
of
the
government
do
not
have
court-martial
jurisdiction.
they've
never
had
court-martial
jurisdiction.
they're
able
to
carry
out
their
functions
without
court-martial
jurisdiction.
in
addition
--
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
in
addition,
of
course,
there
are
--
there
are
also
americans
who
are
abroad
as
tourists
and
americans
abroad
employed
by
private
concerns
who
are
as
always
subject
to
the
foreign
country's
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
a.
schuchat
that
--
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
--
the
figure
i
had
was
188,000.
