where
is
that
--
government's
--
is
printed
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
definition
of
what
you
mean
by
charitable,
benevolent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
describe
what
profit
to
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
if
you
mean
by
that
and
justified
by
the
fact
that
they
might
have
to
pay
a
tax
if
you
could
get
the
facts
that
you
allege
if
you
want?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
justification?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
all
the
ordinances
--
are
all
the
taxable
activities
under
ordinance
set
out
on
pages
10
and
11
of
the
petitioners'
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
wondering
if
you
would
look
at
it
and
see
which
one
you
think
they
might
possibly
come
under
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
even
--
even
if
they
would
answer
all
of
your
questions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
very
careful
--
they're
very
careful
to
name
them
especially
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
find
them
for
photographers,
cobblers,
blowers
and
mattress
manufacturers
and
vending
machines.
justice
hugo
l.
black
various
things?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
wondering
if
you
can
think
of
any
ordinance
you
have,
and
would
it
all
fit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
said
these
people
might
be
engaged
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
which
you
know
they
engaged
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
have
an
investigatory
authority
to
find
out
what
you
have
said
is
trying
to
--
is
already
provided
for
licensing,
did
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
understand
your
justification
would
be
that
they
might
come
under
one
of
your
--
one
of
your
licensing
provisions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
understand
that
you
were
doing
this
in
order
to
find
out
something
which
would
enable
you
to
write
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
you're
doing
it
in
order
to
collect
the
tax,
it
says
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
ordinance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think,
you
might
reveal
--
bring
out
the
fact
that
james
in
the
sale
of
mercantile
is
business,
you
could
levy
more
taxes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
abstract.
i'm
talking
about,
is
that
what
you
say
is
your
reason
why
you
think
this
is
justified.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
might
prove
he
engaged
in
the
mercantile
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
if
you
have
any
catch-all
ordinance
as
well
as
in
a
--
impose
a
license
tax,
in
any
group
or
association
which
is
engaged
in
the
dissemination
of
news
and
views
for
profit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
our
policy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
our
policy
as
news,
dues
or
policy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
arguments
on
public
questions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
tax
radio
stations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
it's
your
idea
that
the
ordinance
you
have
would
cover
that,
if
they
make
them.
at
the
end
of
the
year,
they
have
not
spend
as
much
as
they
made
in
doing
what
they
say
they
do,
on
page
26
on
the
subdivision
d.
do
you
remember
what
that
is?
voluntarily,
promoting
equality
of
rights
and
eradicate
as
the
rates.
that's
interested
colored
citizens,
scope
of
their
impartial
separates
and
to
increase
their
opportunities
to
securing
justice
into
court,
education
and
so
forth,
accepting
that
as
correct.
is
it
your
idea
that
your
ordinance
covers
that?
i
don't
quite
understand
your
idea
of
profit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
do
make
a
profit
in
doing
that
or
whatever
you
call
the
profit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
assume
that's
the
hold
up
right
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
they've
collected
$2400
which
they
paid
out
in
salaries
for
their
people
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
officials.
is
it
your
idea
that
they
would
go
anything
under
your
ordinance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
would
have
to
be
engaged
in
something
like
selling
goods
or
some
business
or
anything.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
and
suppose
they
make
a
--
what
you
call
a
profit
out
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
questions
you
asked,
did
it
ask
anything
about
what
they've
been
doing
in
addition
to
this?
i'm
not
talking
about,
i
know
it
asked
for
the
contributors,
the
names
of
their
members
but
did
it
ask
in
what
--
try
to
prove
the
kind
of
activity
in
which
they
have
been
engaged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
well,
that
has
been
given
here.
after
this
was
given,
did
you
ask
anymore?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
give
you
everything
in
this
regard
as
to
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
in
contributors?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
number?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
probably,
do
you
know
that
that's
used
in
catch-all
in
some
dues.
do
you
have
the
ordinance
before
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
last
one
part
of
it.
that's
ordinarily
what
a
catch-all
provision
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
last
of
the
list
of
the
taxable
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
it?
i
just
sort
of
any
what
--
