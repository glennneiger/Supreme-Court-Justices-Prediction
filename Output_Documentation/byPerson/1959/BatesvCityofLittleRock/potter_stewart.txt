justice
potter
stewart
mr.
carter,
i
don't
like
to
interrupt
you
so
early
in
your
argument
but
there
is
something
that
is
not
at
all
clear
to
me.
you
told
us
i
think
that
the
ordinances
are
identical.
justice
potter
stewart
the
little
rock
and
the
north
little
rock
ordinances
and
yet
in
the
--
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
respondent,
city
of
little
rock,
which
is
the
only
respondent's
brief
have,
north
little
rock
not
having
filed
one
as
i
understand
it,
a
statement
is
made
on
page
4
that
there
are
significant
differences
in
the
facts
of
the
little
rock
and
north
little
rock
cases.
could
you
tell
us
what
you
think
they
mean
by
that?
justice
potter
stewart
do
it
in
your
time?
justice
potter
stewart
something
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
to
me
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
--
it
so
construed
it
in
this
very
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
have
in
mind
where
in
the
record
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
construction
appears?
justice
potter
stewart
that
stipulation
was
made
in
the
little
rock
case
not
in
the
north
little
rock?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
contributors
considered
as
taxpayers
themselves,
possible
deductions
that
they
made
--
made
but
that's
of
no
concern,
you
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
the
ordinance
proscribes
a
minimum
fine
of
$50,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
petitioner
was
fined
$25?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
reference
to
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
may
16
of
the
petitioners
brief,
ordinance
number
7809
relieved
charitable
organization
engaging
in
the
occupations
affected
from
the
payment
of
the
privilege
tax
and
the
reference
there
to
the
transcript
at
page
132.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kemp,
the
way
the
word
organization
is,
to
apply
it
in
the
ordinance,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
probably
would
be
several
thousand.
it
says
organization
as
used
herein
means
any
group
of
individuals,
whether
incorporated
or
unincorporated.
that
would
include
a
sunday
night
supper
club,
wouldn't
it
or
thursday
night
bridge
club.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
isn't
charitable
organization,
this
is
organization
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
that's
what
the
ordinance
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
where
did
you
say
that
admission
appears?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
letter,
i
think
of
all
descriptions
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
--
you
thought
you
can
agree
with
your
--
with
your
brother
that
--
that
the
city
of
little
rock
or
the
city
of
north
little
rock
doesn't
have
power
to
impose
an
income
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
now
about
the
individual
contributors?
justice
potter
stewart
general
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
duty
is
imposed
on
the
organization.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kemp.
justice
potter
stewart
based
on
your
analysis
of
the
--
of
the
cases
you
talked
us
about,
n.a.a.c.p.
against
alabama,
and
uphaus
and
the
others,
when
a
constitutional
plan
is
made
in
opposing
a
claim
of
governmental
authority
for
--
for
information,
on
the
basis
of
your
analysis
of
--
of
those
cases
and
--
and
on
the
basis
of
what
you've
said,
don't
you
think
its
incumbent
upon
the
governmental
authority
to
justify
its
request
for
what
otherwise
might
be
constitutionally
protected
information
with
some
specificity.
don't
those
cases
go
that
way?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
isn't
it
true
that
these
little
rock
privilege
occupation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
ordinances
and
there
are
many,
many
of
them.
they
license
tree
surgeons
and
mattress
manufacturers
and
plumbers
and
vending
machine
operators
and
so
on
but
they
--
in
other
words,
the
measure
of
taxability
depends
in
the
first
instance
on
the
activity
of
the
organization,
has
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
only
if
you'll
find
that
that
activity
would
be
taxable,
then
and
only
then
do
you
look
to
see
whether
or
not
it's
a,
whether
or
not
it's
a
charitable
organization
to
see
--
to
determine
whether
the
organization
would
then
be
exempt
from
a
tax
of
what
otherwise
be
payable,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kemp,
one
more
question.
going
back
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
basic
question
as
to
the
--
perhaps
the
basic
issue
in
the
case
as
to
the
--
as
to
relevance
of
this
information.
now,
the
ordinance
in
section
d
requires
that
upon
request,
an
organizations
reveal
the
purpose
or
purposes
of
such
organization.
and
this
organization,
the
organization
represented
by
the
petitioner
did
fully
answer
the
information
requested
under
section
b,
didn't
it?
appearing
on
page
40
and
41
of
the
record.
now,
is
--
has
any
claim
been
made
or
are
you
making
any
claim
now,
that
the
activities
there
described
are
subjects
to
what
--
that
--
that
an
organization
that
carries
on
the
activities
there
described
whether
for
profit
of
not
for
profit
is
subject
to
any
license
tax
imposed
by
little
rock
or
north
little
rock?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
if
--
and
if
you
didn't
accept
their
statement
or
if
you
wanted
them
in
more
particularized
statement,
the
--
you
or
this
--
or
the
appropriate
officials
in
the
municipality
could
ask
for
it,
couldn't
it?
as
to
a
more
detailed
statement
of
how
they
carry
on
these
activities?
justice
potter
stewart
under
this
ordinance,
under
d
of
this
ordinance.
and
no
--
no
such
effort
was
made
by
the
city
was
it,
to
get
--
to
get
a
more
particularized
statement
of
the
purpose
under
d
of
the
ordinance?
and
as
--
as
the
statement
now
appears,
you're
telling
us
that
even
catch-all
part
of
the
ordinance,
the
catch-all
ordinance,
wouldn't
cover
these
activities
even
if
conducted
for
a
profit,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
assuming
a
profit.
let's
assume
that
--
that
these
activities
are
carried
on
for
a
profit?
justice
potter
stewart
but
under
what
ordinance
would
the
tax
be
due,
even
assuming
the
profit
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
carrying
on
these
activities.
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
tell
us
the
citation
of
that
catch-all
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
that
--
is
that
original
ordinance
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
outside
the
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
that's
the
basic
--
justice
potter
stewart
7444?
