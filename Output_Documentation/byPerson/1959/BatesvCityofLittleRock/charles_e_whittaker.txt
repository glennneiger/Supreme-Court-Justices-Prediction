justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
mr.
carter
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
carter,
before
you
do
that,
isn't
there
a
more
direct
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question?
does
not
subsection
e
of
this
ordinance
provide
for
financial
statement
of
dues
and
by
whom
paid?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
would
not
that
include
all
members?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
maybe
this
isn't
the
time
to
raise
the
question
that
is
in
my
mind.
how
do
we
get
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
constitutional
right
to
require
the
deduction
of
that
material,
when,
as
i
read
this
ordinance
there
is
no
duty
placed
by
it
upon
individuals
to
furnish
information?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
section
2
makes
the
duty
to
develop
solely
upon
the
organizations,
doesn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
for
breach
of
duty,
it
would
be
the
organizations'
breach.
is
there
anything
in
this
ordinance
that
makes
the
--
that
imposes
the
duty
upon
the
individuals?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
does
that
raise
a
due
process
question
in
your
view
or
are
you
simply
relying
upon
the
terms
of
the
ordinance
in
contending
that
it
violates
first
amendment
rights?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
whether
that
might
be
contested
or
not,
you
make
no
point
of
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
carter
before
you
go
on,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
could
we
validly
sustain
a
conviction
even
though
no
objections
be
made,
under
a
statute
which
does
not
purport
to
impose
a
criminal
liability
upon
individuals?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
wasn't
it
inherent?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
thinking
of
an
action
with
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
am
thinking
of
a
matter
that
was
before
me
on
the
court
of
appeals.
under
a
2255
motion
for
one
that
pleaded
guilty
to
a
charge
in
an
information
or
indictment
and
had
been
sentenced,
then
sought
relief
under
a
2255
motion
upon
the
ground
that
the
indictment
affirmatively
showed
on
its
face
that
it
was
barred
by
limitations
and
didn't
constitute
an
offense
and
was
therefore
confronted
with
the
question
whether
the
defense
was
raised
or
not.
can
there
be
a
conviction
when
under
the
law,
no
offense
is
charged
and
that
was
i
am
thinking
about
here.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
kemp.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please,
had
there
been
any
claim
of
tax
exception
on
this
occupation,
under
this
occupation
tax
ordinance
by
in
n.a.a.c.p.
in
advance
of
these
steps?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
has
been
my
–
(inaudible)
your
city
prior
to
the
adoption
of
this
ordinance
to
anticipate
possible
claims
of
exemption
or
a
weight
there
being
made?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
do
you
know
as
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
whether
this
ordinance
under
which
this
occupation
ordinance,
74
something
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
contains
penalties
for
failure
to
file
the
required
returns
and
pay
the
occupation
license
fees?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
criminal
penal
clause.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
kemp.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
in
supplementation
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
what
relevance
you
claim
for
the
language
in
section
e
of
this
ordinance,
“dues
by
whom
and
by
whom
paid,
the
dues
and
by
whom
paid?”
what
relevance
does
that
have
to
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
a
certain
tax
payer,
if
he
claimed
exemption,
was
not
entitled
to
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
phrase
“dues
and
by
whom
paid”
would
reveal
of
course
the
entire
membership,
wouldn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
it
would
at
least
--
would
include
the
dues-paying
members?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
have
you
to
say
about
the
question
that
if
one
who
doesn't
raise
a
defense
that
a
certain
statute
doesn't
charge
a
crime,
nevertheless,
is
convicted
of
the
crime
and
whether
or
not
we
can
sustain
such
a
conviction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
--
may
--
maybe
you
don't
agree,
maybe
you
take
the
position
that
this
ordinance
does
impose
a
duty
on
individuals?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
except
for
the
affidavit
that
the
president
must
file
under
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
some
section
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
if
--
aside
from
that,
is
there
any?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
the
president
must
file
an
affidavit?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
duty
is
on
the
organization,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
by
--
by
fine?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
is
it
your
idea
of
the
law,
maybe
this
is
right.
it's
not
been
my
notion
that
a
criminal
statute
which
with
imposes
some
kind
of
a
liability
in
criminal
in
character
for
the
corporation,
may
nevertheless
be
imposed
upon
its
agents,
the
crime
may
--
the
penalty
upon
its
agents
for
the
corporate
failure,
is
that
right?
can
that
be
done?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
a
newspaper
reporter
be
an
interested
person?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
kemp.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
little
rock
claims
that
any
business
owes
but
hasn't
paid
an
occupation
license.
as
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier
in
answer
to
a
question,
that
i
asked
you,
they
could
simply
assess
it
under
the
existing
ordinance
7444,
together
with
any
penalties
for
failure
to
promptly
apply
and
pay.
that's
been
the
normal
remedy
until
the
enactment
of
this
new
section
in
that,
this
new
ordinance.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
the
old
one
still
exist,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
doesn't
that
then
allow
you
to
collect
any
back
occupational
taxes,
that
are
--
do
you?
you
assess
them
at
whatever
figure
you
think
is
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
after
the
list
of
the
thing
--
