mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
the
court
please,
the
question
involved
in
this
litigation
concerns
the
constitutional
validity
of
two
ordinances
and
petitioners'
conviction
there
under.
the
ordinances
were
enacted
by
the
city
of
little
rock,
and
by
the
city
of
north
little
rock,
as
amendments
to
what
is
known
as
their
occupation
license
ordinance
and
they're
set
out
--
we've
set
out
the
little
rock
ordinance
on
page
6
and
7
of
the
brief
for
petitioner
but
the
ordinance
of
north
little
rock
is
identical.
this
ordinance
or
these
ordinances
require
that
any
organization
operating
within
the
confines
of
the
municipality
give
on
demand
information
concerning
the
organization
to
the
city
council
and
on
page
7
is
a
list
of
the
things
that
the
ordinance
demands,
the
name
of
the
organization,
the
official
place
of
business,
the
name
of
the
officers,
the
purpose,
or
purposes
of
the
organization
and
section
e,
the
financial
statement
of
the
organization
with
fees
and
assessments
and
to
whom
such
(inaudible)
paid
in
an
affidavit
from
the
president
of
the
organization
if
it
is
an
--
an
affiliate
of
a
national
group
of
what
that
group
is.
pursuant
to
these
ordinances,
demands
were
made
on
petitioners
here
for
the
information.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
there
are
--
there
are
significant
differences.
what
was
meant
was
that
in
the
reply
to
the
ordinance,
in
reply
in
terms
of
the
information,
i
gather
that
the
mrs.
williams
in
--
in
north
little
rock
gave
what
the
--
mr.
kemp,
and
this
city
of
little
rock
is
contending,
complied
more
fully
with
the
statute.
now
i
will
--
if
you
--
if
you'll
give
me
time,
i
will
meet
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
argument
in
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
in
one
moment
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
as
soon
as
i
get
the
facts
of
problems,
your
honor.
the
--
pursuant
to
--
to
these
ordinances,
demands
were
made
on
these
petitioners
and
they
complied
with
the
ordinances
by
sending
out
information
as
requested.
mrs.
williams
sent
a
letter
to
the
little
rock,
the
north
little
rock
city
council
which
is
set
out
on
page
40
of
the
record
in
which
she
gave
the
names
of
the
officers,
the
official
place
of
business,
indicated
that
the
purpose
of
the
organization
by
quoting
from
the
articles
of
incorporation
of
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people,
a
financial
statement
with
regard
to
it,
but
refused
to
give
the
names
of
members
and
contributors
on
the
grounds
that
these
people
might
be
subjected
to
various
kinds
of
reprisals
and
that
therefore,
she
could
not
afford
to
give
the
--
the
names
up
and
secondly,
that
the
city
had
no
authority
to
demand
this
information
because
it
was
an
invasion
of
the
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
in
section
e
and
this
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
--
the
city
--
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
has
construed
the
statute
as
requiring
the
names
of
members
and
contributors.
the
--
the
--
respondent
here
contends
that
section
e
can
be
construed
or
could
be
construed
as
merely
requiring
a
list
of
financial
contributors.
now,
insofar
as
we're
concerned,
this
makes
no
difference
since
financial
contributors
includes
the
entire
membership
list.
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
--
the
respondent
can
make
this
kind
of
contention
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
has
construed
the
statute
as
reaching
membership
and
--
and
contributions
and
in
--
my
understanding
is
that
we
are
bound
by
that
interpretation
as
this
court
in
the
analysis
of
these
problems.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
in
the
opinion
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
court
speaks
--
the
court
speaks
on
page
44,
the
courts
and
throughout
--
on
page
74
of
the
record,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
74
of
the
record
in
the
second
sentence
of
the
second
paragraph.
the
court
says,
"furnishing
of
membership
list
of
nonprofit
organizations
in
arkansas
as
the
basis
of
being
deter
--
determined
a
nonprofit
has
been
the
rule
in
arkansans
since
1875."
and
it
goes
--
goes
on
to
indicate
that
further
in
the
--
in
the
opinion
that
the
requirement
that
members
and
contributors
be
furnished,
is
not
an
invasion
of
any
constitutional
rights
which
have
been
asserted
by
the
petitioner
here.
so
that
--
and
it
--
and
analyzes
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
it
indicates
gives
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
we
--
we
argued
--
this
case
was
--
was
briefed
and
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
and
at
the
--
at
the
trial
of
this
case
throughout
the
trial,
as
a
requirement
that
the
names
and
addresses
of
members
and
contributors
be
furnished.
we
raised
this
issue
in
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
contending
that
if
the
statutes
that
required
this,
it
was
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
rights.
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
indicates,
deals
with
this
question
that
we've
raised
and
indicates
that
this
is
no
infirmity
in
the
statute
even
though
--
in
the
ordinance
even
though
this
is
required.
so
that,
as
far
as
our
understanding
of
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
it
is
that
the
--
the
this
--
this
--
the
ordinance
reaches
membership
list
and
contributions,
but
that
--
in
reaching
it,
it
is
--
it
is
being
done
as
the
--
the
exercise
of
a
valid
taxing
authority
of
the
state
--
of
the
city
of
north
little
rock
and
little
rock
and
therefore,
the
breach
of
first
amendment
rights
is
mere
incidence
of
this
and
it
has
to
be
sustained.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
we
--
i'm
--
i'm
merely
give
--
giving
the
--
we
took
the
position
that
the
--
that
the
ordinance
required
the
listing
of
members
and
contributors.
as
you
will
note
in
the
letter
which
i've
just
indicated
on
page
--
which
--
on
--
on
page
40
and
41
which
mrs.
--
and
42
which
mrs.
williams
signed.
the
--
we
cannot
give
you
any
information
with
respect
to
the
names
and
addresses
of
our
members
and
contributors
or
any
information
which
may
lead
to
the
ascertainment
of
such
information,
setting
forth
the
reasons
why
this
was
being
refused.
we
were
--
we
--
and
when
we
went
to
--
into
court
and
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
this
was
the
--
this
was
the
issue
which
was
put
was
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
was
dissented.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
the
--
the
--
it's
a
mere
recital
that
we
were
tried
for
the
violation
of
this
ordinance.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
will
--
i
have
one
more
thing.
i
think
if
--
if
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
i
may
refer
your
attention
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
the
--
the
--
i
think
that
the
confusion
which
is
--
had
come
is
because
of
--
that
the
respondent
has
contributed,
is
--
is
saying
that
this
section
could
be
interpreted
as
to
not
to
include
a
membership
list.
our
view
of
this
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
has
construed
the
statute
as
reaching
members
and
contributors.
and
it
was
so
treated
and
therefore,
insofar
as
this,
as
our
problem
before
the
court
is
concerned,
we
are
bound
by
that
construction
and
the
ordinance
must
be
read
as
reaching
that
problem
that
there
is
no
--
so
that,
the
difference
between
members
and
contributors
is
not
really
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
what
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
duty
which
the
--
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
treated
the
duty
on
the
petitioners
as
custodians
of
the
records
of
the
members
--
membership
list
and
the
contributors
list
of
the
organization
and
assumed
that
the
petitioners
were
being
called
upon
to
supply
this
information
for
the
organization
and
that
therefore,
their
failure
to
do
so
that
the
ordinance
--
that
they
had
violated
the
ordinance.
this
is
how
--
this
--
this
is
how
the
case
was
tried
and
this
how
the
case
was
--
was
decided
both
in
--
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
--
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
--
our
--
our
feeling
on
this
is
that
insofar
as
the
custodian
of
the
membership
list
of
an
organization
is
concerned
that
the
custodian
is
the
person,
since
these
--
these
are
penal
--
is
the
penal
statute
that
the
custodian
of
the
membership
list
on
refusal
to
give
up
the
membership
list
is
--
if
it
is
required
that
the
custodian
could
be
reached.
and
we
did
not
and
the
court
raised
any
issue
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
whether
they
could
reach
the
organization
or
the
custodian
of
the
membership
list.
we
took
--
we
--
we
based
the
assumption
on
the
fact
that
they
--
that
the
custodian
could
be
reached
because
having
the
membership
list
and
refusing
it
that
they
could
be
reached
by
the
statute
and
this
is
how
--
this
probably
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
we
made
no
point
of
it
below
and
we
don't
think
we're
in
the
position
to
make
any
point
of
it
here.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
this
was
the
--
this
was
the
issue.
i
might
add,
if
the
court
please,
one
other
issue
which
i
think
that
the
respondents
make
which
they
cannot
make
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
on
that
--
that
particular
point.
they
seek
to
argue
that
insofar
as
mrs.
bates
is
concerned
that
her
conviction
can
be
sustained
aside
from
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
demand
for
the
membership
list
because
they
contend
that
section
e,
that
she
did
not
comply
with
section
e
by
making
a
full
statement
to
the
--
to
the
--
which
they
say
is
demanded
through
the
city
council.
this
stipulation
on
--
on
page
6,
it
seems
to
us
forecloses
that
because
the
stipulation
was
that
the
only
manner
in
which
there
had
been
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
ordinance
was
--
was
the
failure
to
give
the
membership
list.
this
is
how
the
case
was
argued,
briefed,
tried
and
treated
in
the
supreme
court
of
--
of
arkansas.
and
we
do
not
think
that
the
defendant
respondents
can
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation
say
that
there
is
anything
else
in
the
case.
so,
our
contention
is
that
the
only
issue
in
the
case
in
terms
of
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
ordinance
is
whether
petitioners
were
required
to
supply
to
the
--
to
the
city
the
names
and
addresses
of
their
members
since
they
complied
in
all
respects
according
to
the
stipulation
at
trial
with
every
other
phase
of
this
--
of
the
ordinance
which
is
now
before
the
court.
we
make
two
contentions
in
--
in
respect
to
this
problem.
i
might
--
i
might
say
if
i
will
to
complete
the
facts
that
both
mrs.
bates
and
mrs.
williams
were
tried
separately,
that
they
were
convicted
and
fined.
they
--
appeals
were
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
where
the
cases,
although
separate,
were
consolidated
because
of
the
fact
that
they
raised
the
same
issue.
and
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
held
that
our
contentions
that
these
statutes
are
unconstitutional
were
without
merit,
with
two
justices
dissented
but
with
no
opinion
and
the
case
is
here.
i
am
advised
the
city
of
north
little
rock
has
not
trialed
in
affirmance
here,
but
mr.
kemp,
in
representing
the
city
of
little
rock
since
the
statutes
--
the
ordinances
are
the
same,
i
--
i
think
that
the
issues
which
are
involved
here
can
--
will
be
presented.
now
to
--
back
to
the
first
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
me
about
the
differences,
i
think
that
what
was
a
alluded
to
here
was
that
the
--
the
arguments
that
i've
just
referred
to
that
mr.
kemp
believes
he
can
make
and
which
i
don't
believe
he
could
make
here,
and
that
is
that
there
was
compliance
with
the
statute
insofar
as
mrs.
williams
was
concerned
because
she
gave
a
more
detailed
statement
in
respect
to
her
--
her
financial
statement
which
he
indicates
is
required
by
section
e
of
the
ordinance.
but
our
contention
is
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
--
has
been
has
a
stipulation
that
the
only
failure
to
comply
with
the
ordinance
was
the
failure
to
give
a
membership
list
that
this
contention
can't
be
made
and
therefore,
there
is
--
there
--
there
are
no
differences
in
the
facts,
the
essential
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir,
made
in
little
rock.
now,
we
make
briefly
three
contentions.
we
contend
first
that
if
this
is
not
tax
ordinance,
that
it
is
unconstitutional
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
the
demand
for
the
names
and
addresses
of
members
and
contributors
and
therefore,
that
n.a.a.c.p.
versus
alabama
is
controlling.
we
contend
that
if
it
is
tax
ordinance
as
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
has
--
had
held
that
it
is
a
tax
ordinance,
that
in
the
application
of
this
ordinance
to
us
that
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
has
failed
to
meet
the
standards
which
this
court
held
must
be
met
in
this
kind
of
situation
in
speiser
versus
randall.
we
contend
further
that
if
the
court
disagrees
with
our
--
our
--
with
us
and
that
this
is
a
valid
tax
ordinance
and
that
it
has
been
applied
without
due
process
arguments
--
without
a
due
process
argument
being
--
without
being
able
to
make
a
due
process
argument
as
to
its
application
that
nonetheless,
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
in
that,
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship
between
the
objective
of
the
ordinance
which
is
to
determine
tax
status
and
the
demand
that
the
disclosure
of
names
and
addresses
of
members
and
contributors
be
given.
now,
the
--
the
first
question
that
that
is
--
that
this
is
which
we
--
it
is
our
view
that
realistically,
that
this
is
not
really
a
tax
ordinance,
the
purpose
of
this
act
--
the
purpose
of
this
--
of
this
ordinance
in
both
the
little
rock
and
north
little
rock
was
an
effort
to
curb
the
activities
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.
branches
in
those
areas
because
it
has
been
found
that
the
--
the
most
effective
way
to
curb
the
activities
of
the
association
in
areas
in
the
south
is
by
the
publication,
public
disclosure
of
the
names
of
the
members
and
contributors
because
this
has,
as
the
record
in
this
case
discloses,
fact
is
frightening
things
for
people.
and
what
will
happen
is
the
people
become
afraid
to
participate
in
the
organizational
activities.
they
are
often
as
the
record
also
discloses
when
they
are
so
identified
as
mrs.
williams
and
so
forth,
they
are
subject
to
various
pressures.
so
that,
our
view
it
is
that
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
want
to
--
i
will
come
to
this.
i
think
that
--
i'm
--
i'm
talk
--
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
this
is
realistically
what
we
regard
as
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
ordinance.
we
went
--
we
attempted
to
indicate
in
the
record
to
--
to
obtain
testimony
from
the
--
from
those
who
were
the
authors
of
the
ordinance
as
to
what
its
purpose
was.
and
in
this,
to
attempt
to
show
that
in
--
insofar
as
the
purpose
of
the
ordinance
was
concerned
and
that,
that
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
by
the
sponsors
of
the
two
ordinances,
that
what
was
desired
was
to
--
in
one
instance
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
in
the
organization
and
secondly,
to
find
out
whether
there
were
violations
of
gambling
ordinance
and
so
forth.
we
believe,
we
don't
to
--
in
order
to
show
this,
we
think
of
course
that
from
the
--
from
the
stand
point
of
the
legal
position,
in
which
we
are
at
the
present
time,
we
maybe
required
to
accept
and
the
--
the
court
may
not
want
to
go
behind
the
analysis
of
the
ordinance
which
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
has
made
up,
and
that
is
the
--
the
tax
ordinance.
but
our
--
my
argument
was
addressed
to
the
fact
that
what
i
considered
to
be
the
realistic
purpose
of
this
ordinance
that
we
call
the
"bennet
ordinance"
which
is
the
--
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
arkansas
and
there
has
been
no
reasons,
we
think,
to
support
the
ordinance
on
any
tax
for
a
tax
purpose
shown
in
this
record
or
by
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
record
does
not
show
how
many
organizations
are
potentially
subject
to
the
ordinance.
the
indications
are,
the
argument
of
the
respondent
is
that
all
organizations
are
subject
--
all
organizations
are
subject.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
i,
and
i
do
not
know.
i
think
that
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
or
in
the
brief
of
the
respondents
that
some
six
organizations,
some
five
or
six
other
organizations
have
complied
with
the
--
with
the
requirements
of
this
particular
statute.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
think
that,
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no.
i
don't
think
that
i
would
be
in
a
position
to
make
that
kind
of
argument.
we
did
not
make
an
equal
protection
presentation
in
the
court
below
because
we
were
in
no
position
to
get
the
information
in
respect
to
how
it
had
been
applied.
as
i've
indicated,
our
feeling
is
that
this
is
--
this
is
--
that
the
ordinance
is
directed
against
us
and
that
we
are
the
only
organization
which
had
--
which
they
have
sought
to
seek
to
comply
with
the
statute.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
the
--
i
suppose
that
the
most
serious
contention
which
has
been
made
with
respect
to
this
ordinance
is
the
--
the
analysis
of
it
by
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas.
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
construes
this
ordinance
as
being
an
exercise
of
a
valid
taxing
authority
of
the
state.
now,
if
i
may
bring
the
court's
attention
to
page
5
of
our
brief?
state
of
arkansas,
in
1947,
enacted
section
19-4601,
the
pertinent
portions
of
which
we've
set
out
on
page
5
and
top
of
page
6.
this
was
a
grant
to
municipalities
in
the
--
in
the
state
of
arkansas
of
authority
to
secure
from
persons,
firms
and
corporations
engaged
in
various
kinds
of
businesses
and
professions
and
callings
in
their
respective
communities,
a
privilege
or
a
license
tax
for
the
--
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business,
of
doing
this
kind
of
business
within
the
confines
of
the
city,
an
annual
license
tax.
the
statute
sets
out
that
the
--
this
--
the
municipalities
are
empowered
to
--
to
levy
the
tax
on
the
trade,
on
the
--
on
the
character
of
the
--
to
differentiate
of
--
with
respect
to
the
character
of
the
calling
and
they
can
levy
it
on
the
goods
and
stocks,
but
they
cannot
make
a
levy
on
--
on
income
or
earnings.
pursuant
to
this
grant
of
authority,
and
i'm
only
going
to
discuss
little
rock
because
--
little
rock
of
the
ordinance
because
of
the
facts
that
as
i've
indicated,
they
are
identical.
little
rock
enacted
an
ordinance,
7444
and
this
ordinance
may
set
a
various
classifications
of
persons
who
were
at
trades,
businesses
and
callings
within
the
city.
this
ordinance,
a
copy
of
which
in
the
record
in
the
clerk's
office,
we
did
not
print
it,
levies
a
tax
either
a
flat
tax
on
it
--
on
a
profession.
it
levies
a
tax
based
upon
the
character
of
the
business
for
example,
a
tax
is
graded
in
the
on
with
respect
to
parking
lot,
the
tax
might
be
graded
based
upon
the
number
of
cars
that
are
parked
each
day.
the
tax
on
mechanic
shops,
the
tax
may
be
levied
based
upon
the
number
of
--
of
persons
who
are
employed.
there
are
--
in
this
particular
statute,
there
are
about
a
thousand
classifications
which
are
subject
to
tax.
in
order
to
engage
in
the
occupation
listed,
before
you
can
engage
in
this
occupation,
you
are
required
to
pay
this
particular
fee
and
to
pay
it
annually.
the
city
collector
then
issues
you
a
license
in
your
name,
indicated
for
what
period
it
is
supposed
to
operate
and
you
are
required
that
have
this
license
on
public
display
in
your
place
of
business
and
--
and
if
you
are
an
attorney,
you'll
--
the
license
is
supposed
to
be
in
your
office.
now
this
ordinance,
7444,
was
amended
several
times
when
various
other
businesses
came
into
the
city
and
added
classifications
where
to
--
were
taxed.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
refers
to
a
section
7809
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
on
page
15
and
16
of
petitioners'
brief,
we
have
listed
the
various
amendments
and
where
they
will
be
found
in
the
unprinted
record.
17809,
which
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
refers
to,
granted
to
charitable
institutions,
who
engage
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
or
selling,
an
exemption
from
the
payment
of
the
license
tax.
then
the
present
ordinance
with
which
we
are
now
dealing
was
enacted,
last
year.
you
will
note
that
this
ordinance
recites
that
the
--
and
it's
whereas
clauses,
that
whereas
many
organizations
claiming
exception
from
7444,
the
original
occupation
license
tax,
are
that
their
claim
of
exemption
is
a
mere
subterfuge
and
that
they
are
really
operating
for
profit
and
therefore,
this
ordinance
was
passed
in
order
to
determine
tax
there.
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
construes
our
position
in
this
particular
litigation
as
being
that
the
n.a.a.c.p.,
one,
is
subject
to
--
to
7444
and
its
amendments.
in
other
words,
that
we
are
either
engaged
in
an
occupation
or
some
kind
of
occupation
which
is
subject
to
tax,
and
two,
that
we
have
claimed
an
exemption
from
the
occupation.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
establish
by
the
city
that;
one,
that
the
association
has
engaged
in
any
occupation
which
is
subject
to
license
under
this
statute
--
under
these
ordinances.
two,
there
is
no
evidences
in
the
record
that
we
have
claimed
any
exemption
because
of
the
fact
that
not
being
engaged
in
the
occupation
which
was
subject
to
license,
we
had
no
occasion
to
claim
any
exemption
at
all.
nonetheless,
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
in
its
opinion
presumes
that
we
are
seeking
tax
immunity
and
therefore
that
we
are
subject
to
the
--
to
this
ordinance
and
therefore
holds
that
we
could
be
required
to
give
up
our
membership
list
and
therefore
be
required
to
comply
with
the
ordinance.
we
think
that
under
this
construction
of
the
law
and
of
the
ordinance
that
this
is
clearly
within
the
area
which
this
court
condemns
in
speiser
versus
randall.
our
position
is
that
if
the
city
of
little
rock
is
to
bring
the
association
within
the
confines
of
this
particular
ordinance,
it
would
have
to
show
that
we
are
engaged
in
some
occupation
which
is
subject
to
license.
and
that
we
have
either
not
paid
it
for
the
demand
for
--
for
payment
of
a
fee
has
been
made
upon
the
--
the
n.a.a.c.p.
that
they
have
failed
to
do
so
and
that
they
are
claiming
tax
exemption
and
tax
exemption
from
the
payment
of
business.
we
contend
that
this
would
have
to
be
shown
or
else
the
application
of
the
ordinance
to
us
is
a
violation
of
due
process.
it's
clearly
a
violation
of
the
standards
which
this
court
said
have
to
be
met
in
the
area
of
--
where
free
speech
is
involved
as
it
was
indicated
in
speiser
versus
randall.
now,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
we
think
that
this
was
the
construction
placed
on
it,
it
was
now
placed
within
the
ordinance,
and
the
--
the
ordinance
has
been
invalidly
applied
to
us
for
this
reason.
but
to
--
to
end
on
my
final
point,
if
the
court,
and
this
we
say
that
if
the
court
is
persuaded,
this
court
is
persuaded
that
the
supreme
court
of
--
of
arkansas
in
assuming
that
we,
that
the
--
the
organization
was
subject
to
the
ordinance
and
in
assuming
that
the
organization
was
seeking
a
tax
exemption
without
having
any
facts
in
the
record
upon
which
to
base
that
assumption,
if
it
could
do
that
and
not
raise
serious
due
process
questions,
then
our
contention
is
that
the
ordinance
is
still
bad
because
7444
which
is
an
occupation
license
tax,
as
i
had
attempted
to
indicate
applies
to
the
character
and
kind
of
business
or
to
the
amount
of
stock
and
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
an
organization
is
invalidly
seeking
tax
exemption
from
its
application
in
our
judgment,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
who
the
members
are
or
anything
of
that
kind.
it
has
to
do
with
the
activity
of
the
organization
and
we
say
therefore
that
insofar
as
the
ordinance
seeks
the
disclosure
of
the
names
of
our
members
and
contributors
that
this
does
not
further,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
ordinance
and
therefore
at
best,
there
can
be
no
--
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship
between
the
two
and
the
statute
must
fall.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir
because
our
--
our
as
i've
indicated,
i
think
that
the
--
that
under
the
grant
of
authority
from
the
state,
there
can
be
no
tax
on
income
and
therefore
the
--
the
tax
has
to
be
on
the
occupation
on
what
is
being
done.
and
is
now
--
our
--
our
view
is
that
the
city
of
little
rock
under
this
grant
of
authority
could
levy
a
tax
on
--
on
activity,
on
what
is
being
done
and
that
--
and
that
these
--
these
circumstances,
if
it
made
that
kind
of
classification,
this,
under
this
grant
of
authority
would
be
proper.
but
since
it
cannot
tax
income,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
there
can
be
no
possible
relationship
between
the
disclosure
question
which
we
think
the
raises
the
first
amendment
questions
and
the
objective
which
state
seeks.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
this
is
--
it
--
the
--
the
municipality
has
to
get
its
authority
for
the
validity
of
this
ordinance.
we
--
we
contend
from
this
--
the
grant
of
authority
from
the
state.
it
has
no
right
under
--
and
since
it
is
seeking
to
derive
it
from
the
state,
it
has
no
power
to
--
to
do
anything
else.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
please,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
would
think,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
this
question
would
raise
--
it's
the
first
time,
to
be
frank
with
you,
that
it
--
it
had
occurred
to
--
to
me,
this
question
might
raise
some
due
process
--
a
due
process
argument.
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
but
our
understanding
of
the
--
i
think
that
actually,
in
the
municipal
court
which
is
the
record
is
not
here,
we,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
we
made
or
attempted
to
make
such
a
defense,
but
we
were
convinced
that
the
law
of
arkansas
reached
the
individual
custodian
of
the
record
in
order
to
reach
the
organization.
and
since
our
basic
problem
was
the
question
of
the
free
speech
issue
which
we
thought
was
the
basic
issue
here,
we
do
not
pursue
that
at
all.
so
that,
i'm
in
no
--
frankly,
i'm
in
no
position
to
argue
that
question
here
because
i
am
reasonably
certain
that
is
the
stage
of
the
proceedings
that
if
--
if
the
question
is
present.
the
question
is
present
that
as
far
as
the
petitioner
is
concerned,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
that
we
have
waived
it
in
the
court
below
and
i
don't
think
we're
in
a
position
to
make
that
kind
of
argument
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
this
--
the
ordinance
under
the
--
the
statutes
of
arkansas,
statutory
authority
that
the
fine
could
only
be
$25.
in
fact,
the
matter
is,
mrs.
bates
was
fined
$100
but
the
grant
of
authority
is
only
$25
and
the
--
the
--
there
--
there
is
no
power
in
the
municipality
to
fine
any
--
any
more
than
this
and
this
was
brought
out
on
--
in
the
circuit
of
court
of
appeals
in
the
--
and
the
city
conceded
error
and
indicated
that
the
fine
would
have
to
be
$25.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
well,
i
--
i
think
--
pardon,
which
i
think
that
this
question
that
--
that
you
have
raised,
certainly
raises
a
due
process
question
which
goes
to
the
--
to
the
question
of
the
reach
of
the
ordinance
as
to
whether
or
not
it
can
validly
--
validly
reach
individuals
rather
than
organizations,
but
as
i
indicated
to
the
court,
we
were
concerned
and
our
primary
concern
was
in
terms
of
the
--
of
the
raising
the
issue
of
the
unconstitutional
effect
of
the
statute
in
--
insofar
as
it
attempted
to
reach
on
membership
list.
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
we've
taken
the
position
insofar
as
we
could
in
an
attempt
to
comply
as
nearly
as
we
could
with
these
various
regulations
even
though
we
might
have
a
--
a
constitutional
claim
except
insofar
as
the
question
of
our
membership
list
was
concerned.
we
could
have,
we
think
take
--
taken
the
position
in
this
case
that
the
ordinance
had
no
application
to
us
and
that
we
would
not
give
up
any
of
the
information
which
the
ordinance
demanded,
but
our
view
was
that
we
should
do
as
much
as
we
could
in
compliance
with
this,
except
with
the
--
the
basic
issue
which
affects
the
freedom
of
association
of
our
members
and
the
--
the
effective
activity
of
the
organization
itself.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
the
court
please.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that
mr.
kemp
has
mislead
the
court
in
--
at
least
in
my
understanding
in
--
in
answer
to
his
question
about
the
public,
a
publication
of
this
information.
my
understanding
of
arkansas
law
is
that
a
pubic
record
is
--
is
--
that
there
is
an
entitlement
on
the
--
the
public
access
to
it
and
this
was
set
out
in
a
decision,
collins
versus
state
which
is
at
143
southwest
second
1,
in
which
the
supreme
court
has
--
has
determined
what
is
a
public
record.
so,
that
i
--
i
think
that
the
interested
party,
information
that
he
is
dealing
with
concerns
a
definition
of
what
is
an
interested
party
and
litigation
and
not
with
the
kind
of
problem
that
we
have
here.
one
other
thing,
i
would
like
to
bring
the
court's
attention
to
and
that
is,
the
question
was
asked,
i
mean
i
was
trying
to
find
it.
where
did
it
appear
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
the
--
this
ordinance
was
interpreted
as
applying
only
to
members
as
of
--
as
reaching
membership
in
contributions.
i
might
refer
the
court
to
the
top
of
page
71
where
the
--
of
the
record
on
the
case
where
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
where
it
says
that
--
about
the
third
sentence
that
each
in
prosecuting
her
appealed
to
this
court
raises
this
federal
question.
the
ordinance
involved
insofar
as
it
requires
the
names
and
addresses
of
their
member
of
and
contributors
to
the
local
branch
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.
is
an
invasion
of
rights
etcetera
in
all
questions
merge
into
this.
and
i
might
also
refer
the
court
to
page
76
further
on
in
the
discussion
of
the
opinion,
at
the
top
of
the
page
about,
mid
the
--
the
paragraph
when
the
--
there's
a
--
the
--
the
court
seeks
to
distinguish
n.a.a.c.p.
versus
alabama.
that
says
that
the
ultimate
aim
in
n.a.a.c.p.
versus
alabama
was
to
stop
the
activities
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.
but
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
disclosure
of
n.a.a.c.p.
list
of
members
and
contributors
is
a
mere
incident
to
see
if
legal
taxation
is
being
evaded.
so,
i
think
that
the
--
this
has
been
the
--
this
--
the
--
this
ordinance
has
been
interpreted
to
reach
members
and
contributors.
finally,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
7444
as
i
indicated
before,
list
various
occupation
under
which
there
is
this
--
this
occupation
tax
with
the
listing
of
what
the
amount
of
the
tax
is
and
the
taxes
on
the
business
on
the
--
on
the
activity
is
not
--
is
indicated
on
any
organization
itself.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
--
i
don't
know
of
any
--
i
haven't
seen
any
tax
of
catch-all
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
i
have
a
--
section
1
reads
that
the
carrying
on
of
any
business,
profession,
occupation
of
whatever
kind
or
nature
within
the
city
little
rock,
arkansas
is
hereby
declared
to
be
a
privilege.
and
from
here
on
after
the
effective
date
of
this
ordinance,
any
person,
firm
or
corporation
engaged
in
any
business,
occupation
or
profession
of
whatever
kind
or
nature
within
the
city
of
little
rock,
shall
pay
various
tax.
but
then,
there
is
a
list,
there
is
a
listing
of
the
various
occupations
that
are
subject
to
the
tax
with
the
gradation
of
what
the
tax
is.
and
my
feeling
is
that
this
limits
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
i
don't
know.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
i
have
the
copy
of
it
of
--
of--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
last
section
14
repeals
all
the
other
ordinances
as
being
inequitable.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
alright.
i'll
look
at
--
i
look
for
that.
section
2,
after
listing
the
ordinance,
says
that
any
person
from
a
corporation
selling
any
in
all
kinds
of
goods,
where
as
in
merchandise
unless
otherwise
provided
in
section
1
above
shall
pay
on
the
1st
of
january,
an
annual
privilege
tax
based
upon
one
half
of
1%
of
the
gross
value
of
the
average
stock
inventory
for
the
preceding
year.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
any
person,
firm
or
cooperation
within
the
city
of
little
rock
engaging
in
the
business
of
selling
any
in
all
kinds
of
goods,
wares
and
merchandise
whether
raw
material
or
finished
products
or
both
from
a
regularly
established
place
of
business
maintained
within
the
city
little
rock,
unless
otherwise
provided
in
section
1
above,
shall
pay
on
the
1st
of
january
of
each
year,
an
annual
privilege
tax
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business
within
the
city,
in
an
amount
equal
to
one
half
of
1%
of
the
gross
value
of
the
average
stock
inventory
for
the
preceding
year.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
think
i'm
--
well,
if
the
court
please,
we
--
we
contend
that
this
--
that
--
that
the
ordinance
insofar
as
it
has
been
applied
to
us
as
unconstitutional
and
that
insofar
as
it
seeks
to
get
out
membership
list
for
some
constitutionality
of
the
convictions
hereunder
cannot
stand.
