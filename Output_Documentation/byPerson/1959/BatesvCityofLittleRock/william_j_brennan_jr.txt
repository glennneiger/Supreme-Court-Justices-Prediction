justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
there
any
requirement
for
the
names
of
the
members
of
the
party?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
requirements
for
the
names
of
members?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
--
where
does
that
appear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
does
that
appear
in
the
ordinance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
the
names
of
members?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
suggesting
mr.
carter
that's
an
interpretation
of
--
of
e
of
the
ordinance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
in
the
record
what
you
just
told
us,
namely
that
there's
an
identity
of
contributors
and
members?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
notice
also,
mr.
carter
that
the
trial,
it
opened
with
the
stipulation,
i'm
looking
at
page
5
and
6
between
mr.
kemp,
apparently,
attorney
for
the
city
and
the
attorney
for
mrs.
bates
which
includes
that
the
violation
of
the
ordinance
was
--
and
that
it
failed
to
supply
the
names
of
the
membership
of
that
organization.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
stipulated
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
this
will
constitute
all
requirements
by
any
of
the
petitions
except
on
direct
effect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
directed
purpose
is
made
only
to
comply
with
him
or
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
reach
the
bar
associations,
the
medical
associations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
the
ordinance
has
had
--
they
had
to
go
up
the
ordinance.
so,
there's
--
there
is
a
catch
to
all
your
service
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
imposes
the
license
fee
on
every
businessman
not
otherwise
classified?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
--
if
it
is
a
business
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
is
that
still
--
does
that
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
question?
it
still,
would
you
not
or
don't
you
not
still
have
a
burden
of
establishing
if
there
was
a
business
that
was
engaged
in?
because
that's
the
first
step
before
anytime
is
whether
or
not
as
an
exemption
to
which
it
might
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how
would
you
be
any
better
off
if
you
got
the
names
of
ten
contributors
and
their
addresses
on
the
--
and
i
could
get
$252
and
it
just
tell
you
would
be
a
contribution,
total
receipts
for
the
calendar
year.
could
you
then
make
a
better
determination
than
that's
of
justice
stewart
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
about
--
what
is
it
about
the
names
of
ten
people
with
$2
or
$3
or
$10
along
side
each
that
makes
that
easier
for.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
that
makes
sense.
still,
i
don't
understand
how
you
get
all
of
this
out
of
a
list
of
ten
names
for
the
$2
along
side
each
aggregating
$252?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
what
--
this
is
what
they
reported
to
you.
they
reported
to
you
that
the
total
receipts
of
$252
for
membership
of
its
contributors
for
the
calendar
year,
1957.
they'll
get
it
--
they
spent
$191.60.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
set
the
national
offer
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i'm
sorry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
reading
north
little
rock?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
$1791
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
then
you
get
a
hundred
names
instead
of
ten.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
they
show
us
--
they
show
a
balance
on
hand
of
$300
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
expenditures
under
receipts.
so
they
have
$300
balance
on
hand
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
be
a
profit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
assuming
that
is
a
profit
based
on
what
they
have
told
you
on
the
things
that
they
do
and
the
kind
of
things
their
engaged
in.
is
there
anything
in
your
ordinance
that
will
subject
that
profit,
what
are
--
and
subject
the
organization
by
reason
of
that
profit
to
any
of
these
license
fees
under
the
ordinance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
under
the
ordinance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
catch-all
clause,
have
adverted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
if
there's
a
conclusory
provision
that
this
is
kind
of
a
virtue
that
--
that
the
tax
at
all
events,
any
business,
profession
or
occupation,
not
listed
to
a
$25
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
--
that
was
affected
to
a
merchandise,
yes.
it
would
not
reach
this
ordinance.
