chief

mr.
kemp,
may
i
ask
the
question
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
of
mr.
carter.
how
many
people
have
complied
with
this
ordinance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
between
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
between
five
and
10?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
whole
community
of
little
rock?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
all
the
fraternal
organizations,
the
lodges?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think
there
are
more
than
five
or
six
of
those
in
--
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
little
rock?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
reason
i
--
i
thought
it
was
someone
important
in
this
language
of
this
--
of
the
supreme
court
where
it
said
the
ordinance
here
under
attack
does
not
single
out
the
n.a.a.c.p.
and
require
information
of
it
only.
rather,
the
ordinance
requires
information
of
all
organizations
seeking
exemption
from
privilege
tax.
other
organizations
have
complied.
why
should
this
one
have
immunity
as
though
it
were
a
favorite
child?
now,
they
must
have
had
something
in
the
--
in
the
record
there
or
told
something
to
indicate
that
--
that
this
was
not
discriminatory
as
another
--
all
other
people
in
the
same
position
had
complied.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
--
may
i
interrupt
you
just
a
moment,
mr.
carter
and
ask
mr.
kemp.
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
provision
you
spoke
of?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
you
--
you
may
correct
and
if
you'll
excuse,
mr.
carter
just
a
moment,
to
please
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
merchandise.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
you
may,
mr.
carter
you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
proceed
again.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
