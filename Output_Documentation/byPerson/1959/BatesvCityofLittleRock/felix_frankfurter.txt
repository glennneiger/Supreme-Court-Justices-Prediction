justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
show,
mr.
carter,
how
many
organizations
are
potentially
subject
for
this
ordinance,
and
number
two,
how
many
organizations
in
fact
comply
with
its
requirements?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
wondering
in
number,
is
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
nothing
to
indicate
how
many
are
subject
to
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
it
is
indiscriminatingly
enforced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
or
is
it
part
of
your
argument,
although
sufficient
here
that
in
fact,
this
is,
though
generally
helped
direct
to
begin
and
enforce
against
the
n.a.a.c.p.
and
against
other
amenable
organizations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
to
say
that
what
might
be
--
what's
in
the
back
of
their
heads
within
actual
enforcement
and
operation
of
the
statute?
is
there
anything
in
this
case
to
indicate
the
n.a.a.c.p.
was
singled
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
in
--
would
in
compliance
or
non-compliant
be
a
matter
of
public
record
in
the
little
rock?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
one
could
easily
find
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
in
the
briefs
or
in
the
record,
the
taxing
statute
where
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
--
would
you
mind
sketching
quickly
what
the
tax
amenability
would
be
if
a
non-charitable
and
what
the
statute
says
as
to
immunity
from
such
normal--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
shows
--
which
gives
us
the
fiscal
picture
of
this
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
what
the
source
of
revenue
of
little
rock
is?
how
many
charitable
organizations,
what
it
means
if
they'd
all
refuse
to
obey,
anything
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
tell
us
how
much
the
privilege
tax
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
tell
us
what
the
privilege
tax
for
non-charitable
organizations
is?
that
depends
on
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
know
what
the
financial
responsibility
of
an
organization
into
--
in
little
--
doing
business
or
engage
in
activities
in
little
rock
is
or
what
schedule
of
rate
there
--
there
is
that
does
not
apply
to
these
charitable
organizations
as
you
define
them,
administering
to
the
needy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
said
if
it
doesn't.
well,
i
thought
that's
what
all
this
is
about,
that
you
want
to
make
sure
that
somebody
who
doesn't
pay
a
privilege
tax
is
entitled
not
to
pay
it.
isn't
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
the
ordinance
is
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
want
to
know
what
the
privilege
tax
would
be
if
they're
not
entitled
to
immunity
from
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
according
to
the
functioning
of
the
organization?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
their
profit
or
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can't
tell
how
much
of
little
rock's
revenue
derives
from
that
source?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
guess
how
many
--
how
many
charitable
organizations
if
you
define
them
down
there
--
there
are
operating
in
little
rock?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
would
it
be
of
what
magnitude
would
it
be
200
or
2000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
--
200?
justice
felix
frankfurter
30
charitable
organizations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
a
network
of
occupation
taxes
in
little
rock?
i
mean
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
license
commerce
act
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
license
(inaudible)
--
justice

frankfurter
--
directors.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
subject
to
a
tax
that
he
could
--
a
tax
to
cover
the
administrative
expenses
of
licenses.
justice

the
occupational

taxes
are

sources

yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
radio
stations
--
justice

--
the
t.v.
stations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
state
has
have
a
direct
interest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
how
would
they
be
directly
affected
except
that
they
would
make
the
appropriate
speech
that
their
duty
is
to
redeem
as
a
matter
of
the
public
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
want
asking
it.
this
is
not
what
i
think

frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix

pardon
me?
justice

is
an
interested
party
except
the
city's
fiscal
of

city
political
officers.

i
think
a
contributor
or
a
non-contributor
would
be
interested.
to
see
whether
there,
come
down
as
a
contributor
on
the
absence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
fact.
what
do
you
say
to
my
suggestion,
there
are
non-contributors.
somebody
is
curious
to
see
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
an
alleged
charitable
organization
as
having
its
role
by
including
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
(voice

--
justice

but
the
city
--
what
are
the
--
what
if
they
may
have
the
officially
news
keeping
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
what
the
--
that
office
title.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
city
clerk?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
city
clerk,
out
of
broadmindedness
or
generous
view
of
what
the
public
is
entitled
that
would
make
it
publicly,
he
or
she
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
through
the
city
clerk
and
elected
officials?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
city
men
--
justice
felix

the
dollar
(inaudible)
justice

for
the
little
