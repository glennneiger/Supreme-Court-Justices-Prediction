mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
made
reference
to
the
distinction
between
the
cases
here
and
i'd
like
to
make
one
reference
to
that
as
a
city
attorney
for
the
city
of
little
rock,
i
can
speak
only
for
that
city
and
do
not
propose
to
--
at
all
refer
to
the
trial
and
the
matter
involved
in
the
city
of
north
little
rock.
i
do
however
have
limited
knowledge
of
certain
--
certain
testimony
and
matters
of
record
in
the
north
little
rock
case
and
that
it
is
combined
with
our
transcript.
we
referred
to
a
distinction
between
the
two
because
specifically,
one
of
the
defender,
rather
the
defendant
in
north
little
rock
case
as
i
remember,
it
has
--
was
privileged
without
the
objection
of
the
city
to
make
statements
regarding
the
adverse
effect
which
the
revealing
of
this
information
would
have
on
the
n.a.a.c.p.
and
her
city,
that
is
the
new
membership
dried
and
possibly
the
loss
of
old
members.
those
questions
were
not
--
no
testimony
was
made
in
the
little
rock
case
that
was
admissible.
it
was
read
into
the
record
that
certain
witnesses
would
have
testified
to
facts
concluding
that
this
information
if
revealed
would
and
possibly
had
affected
their
membership,
but
those
are
some
of
the
distinguishing
features
which
we
think
make
the
cases
entirely
different
and
therefore,
we
would
confine
ourselves
to
the
little
rock
case
only.
mr.
carter
confines
his
argument
and
i'm
very
surprised
that
he
has,
to
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
tax
ordinance.
we
wonder
what
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arkansas
or
how
it
could
have
made
it
more
clear
that
this
was
an
ordinance
designed
to
aid
the
city
of
little
rock
in
determining
whether
or
not
taxes
were
proper
against
alleged
charitable
and
nonprofit
organization.
certainly,
if
in
this
case
the
n.a.a.c.p.
were
privileged
to
make
a
self-serving
declaration
and
have
it
go
by
the
board
without
contest
and
without
being
able
to
pierce
the
veil
and
determine
if
the
facts
alleged
therein
were
in
fact
true,
if
that
were
the
case,
then
it
is
entirely
possible
that
no
revenue
at
all
would
be
forthcoming.
they
feel
that
its
--
it
is
possible
further
that
if
they're
unable
to
go
behind
this
statement,
a
self-serving
statement,
that
not
only
this
organization,
and
i
don't
refer
to
the
n.a.a.c.p.
as
--
i
refer
to
it
only
because
it's
a
petitioner
in
this
case,
because
there
were
other
organizations
that
did
furnish
information
required
by
this
ordinance
and
it's
reflected
in
the
statement
in
the
letter
of
dr.
crenshaw
who
originally
contacted
the
city,
relative
to
this
thing
for
the
n.a.a.c.p.
he,
in
that
letter
admitted
that
various
–
several
--
various
under
organizations
had
been
readdressed
to
the
plaintiff.
now,
if
those
organizations
who
claim
immunity
and
i
inject
here
that
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
that
a
claim
be
made
from
immunity
in
order
to
have
this
ordinance
in
effect,
but
if
those
organizations
claiming
immunity
from
the
previous
tax
laws,
are
privileged
to
continue
to
be
active
in
--
in
any
community,
in
any
state,
without
revealing
factors
upon
which
the
governmental
agencies
or
bodies
could
in
fact
determine
if
they
really
were
non
profit.
they
could
be
engaged
in
activities
that
produce
revenues
far
in
excess
of
the
imagination
of
most
of
us.
they
could
be
engages
--
engaged
in
a
profit
venture,
only
by
being
able
to
determine
these
factors
from
our
own
investigation
or
from
the
city's
investigations
can
we
be
assured
that
the
taxes
which
are
justly
due
are
received
by
the
city.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
have
no
knowledge
of
a
claim
of
--
as
such,
your
honor,
except
that
there
had
been
no
taxes
paid.
and
as
the
ordinance
reflected,
was
designed
to
determine
in
an
investigatory
manner
whether
or
not
organizations
allegedly
charitable
and
benevolent
and
nonprofit
were
in
fact
nonprofit
or
were
in
fact
profit
making
organizations.
and
thus,
we,
that
is
the
city
through
its
selected
officials
would
go
out
and
make
an
assessment
if
they
found
that
the
tax
was
proper,
under
other
terms
of
the
occupational
privilege
tax.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i'd
rather
assume,
your
honor,
that
it
had
been
the
latter.
i
have
no
knowledge
of
specific
claims
for
immunity
having
been
made.
the
ordinance
in
question
which
granted
the
immunities,
and
that's
7809,
as
i
remember
by
number,
made
specific
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
is
sundry
charitable
organizations
throughout
the
city
had
been
known
to
be
rendering
a
service
to
needy
in
the
city
and
in
the
community.
and
that
they
were
entitled
by
reason
of
that
service
otherwise
the
city
would
have
to
finance
it
or
the
governmental
body
assembly
that
they
went
at
some
consideration
and
thus,
from
enacted
the
passage
of
this
ordinance,
such
organizations
if
in
fact
true,
nonprofit
and
benevolent.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
is
in
the
original
but
i
have
not
seen
the
original,
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
--
i
just
don't
have
that
knowledge
or
it
depend
on
the
information
we
weigh
was
determined
by
investigation.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp

mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
it
does
have
to
think
penal
clause
--
the
criminal
penal
clauses.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
it
is
not
in
this
record,
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
original
the
plaintiff
provided.
the
clerk
office
has
it.
it
is
not
transcribed
at
this
time.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that
ordinance
which
i
referred
to
as
being
number
7809,
i
--
i
believe,
sir,
made
reference
to
it
in
this
way
that
our
organizations
in
the
city,
benevolent
to
the
extent
they
are
performing
the
services
for
the
needy
and
no
profit
is
derived
there
from.
those
organizations,
i
think,
that
in
itself
is
the
definition
of
what
the
city
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
no
--
no
profit
to
the
organization.
they
are
performing
a
service
--
a
public
service
to
the
needy
in
the
community.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
i'm
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
it's
(voice
overlap)
--
it's
in
the
original
(inaudible)
filed
with
the
clerk.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
there
is
one
--
there
is
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
don't
know
why
it
doesn't
apply
to
them
except
that
they
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
--
i
--
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that
amount
is
set
specifically
by
the
ordinance
and
it
would
depend
of
what
particular
activity
that
organization
was
engaged
in.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that's
right.
it
is
not
a
profit
matter.
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
no,
you
cannot
at
this
time.
that
--
but
--
that
information
would
be
available
but
it
was
not
put
in
this
record.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
your
honor,
i
would
not
attempt
to
say
specifically
but
some
between
five
and
10
as
i
remembered.
i
--
i
would
not
hazard
a
guess
as
to
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
--
specific.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes
organizations,
different
organizations
and
that
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that
is
my
recollection
of
it,
sir.
i
don't
have
the
figures
specifically
and
it
is
not
in
the
record
(voice
overlap)
except
that
an
admission
is
in
this
record
on
the
part
of
petitioners
to
the
effect
that
several
organizations
have
been
requested
to
furnish
–
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
no,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
oh,
certainly
not.
i
would
think
that
will
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that
would
far
exceed
it.
i
would
say
if
there
were
20,
i'd
be
surprised.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
well,
i
think
it
was
intended
if
they
were
charitable
organizations.
they
--
they
don't
all
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
it's
possible.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
if
requested,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
if
--
if
request
is
made.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
well,
i
would
assume
that
they
would
be
hard
to
dispose
of.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
said
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
--
five
or
six
had
been
--
had
been
served,
sir.
i
didn't
say
that
only
five
or
six
of
the
district.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
as
i've
stated
earlier,
the
admission
is
in
here
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
that
other
organizations
had
complied.
therefore,
it
was
not
made
in
--
we
made
no
attempt
to
get
into
the
record
other
than
that.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
on
the
transcript
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
page
25,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
at
the
bottom
--
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
letter
addressed
to
mr.
jack
murphy,
acting
city
clerk
of
little
rock,
arkansas
is
--
since
the
passage
of
little
rock
ordinance
number
10638
and
pursuant
to
provisions
of
said
ordinance
various
city
officials
have
requested
information
from
several
organizations.
the
matter
of
the
relationship,
just
briefly
and
i'll
close
on
that
particular
subject
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
from
contributions
to
the
organization?
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
well,
i
think
certainly,
would
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
names
of
contributors.
these
are
ideas
of
my
own,
they're
not
in
the
record.
certainly,
there
is
no
authority
in
the
case
law
for
this
particular
(inaudible),
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
we
could
assume
that
contributors
conceivably
might
be
paying
money
into
the
organization
and
--
and
claiming
immunity
from
taxes
on
--
on
an
activity
which
he
was
engaged
in
which
was
in
effect
of
profit.
he
might
have
been
claiming
a
nonprofit
exemption.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
did
not
--
i
didn't
attempt,
your
honor,
to
infer
that
it
would
be
on
the
income.
suppose
he
was
engaged
in
an
activity,
in
an
enterprise
and
was
claiming
immunity,
when
in
fact
he
was
making
profit
on
it.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
well,
what
--
what
we
could
find
from
where
he's
getting
his
money.
i
mean,
supposed
he's
engaged
in
the
business
of
--
of
selling
shoe
laces
on
the
corner
in
the
name
of
john
doe
but
in
fact,
he's
a
representative
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.
out
there
actually
making
this
company
--
these
sales
and
is
buying
the
shoe
laces
for
one
cent
a
pair
and
sold
them
for
10
cents
a
pair.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
--
i
would
like
to
draw
a
distinction
if
i
may,
your
honor,
between
the
license
tax
and
the
occupational
privilege
tax.
they
are
different.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
the
other
is
a
regulatory
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
--
type.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
it
is
a
very
big
source
in
the
city's
revenue.
yes,
sir.
the
exact
amount,
i
don't
have.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
specifically
on
the
matter
of
the
dues,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
one
of
the
officials
of
the
organization
for
example
could
very
well
be
paying
in
dues
to
the
organization
in
the
form
of
a
salary
and
--
and
have
the
organization
paying
him
the
salary
the
back
and
even
he
or
she
could
conceivably
be
the
organization
itself.
they'd
be
making
the
profit
from
them.
these
are
suppositions
and
i
--
i
don't
have
the
clear
answers
which
i
know
that
your
honors
are
entitled
to.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
--
that
would
be
another
matter,
that
remains
to
be
seen.
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
membership
pays
dues.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
it
would
include
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
your
honor,
the
record
reflects,
i'm
almost
certain
that
stipulation
was
made
so
that
we
could
proceed
with
the
case
but
it
was
made
because
of
the
fact
that
originally,
the
writ
was
served
on
someone
other
than
the
defender
or
rather
the
petitioner
in
this
case
and
i
stand
corrected
if
mr.
carter
doesn't
agree
with
that.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
think
it's
expressly
that,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
section
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
--
section
at
the
top
of
the
page
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
wouldn't
think
so,
no,
sir.
other
than
that,
i
think
that's
rather
clear,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
no,
sir.
section
6
--
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
you,
top
of
the
page
eight,
petitioner's
brief,
“any
person
or
organization
who
shall
violate
the
provisions
of
this
ordinance
shall
be
deemed
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.”
does
that
clear
the
matter
for
you,
sir?
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
well,
certainly,
i
think
that
we
didn't
penalize
the
corporation,
(inaudible)
of
the
organization.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
no.
i'm
talking
about
--
you
--
you
could
but
there
--
who
would
you
penalize,
where
would
you
get
the
money?
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
in
some
instances
that
can
be
done
--
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor.
we,
in
--
in
this
case
had
attempted
to
get
this
case
tried
and
the
issues
resolved
in
(inaudible)
and
--
and
before
the
court
and
for
that
reason
the
stipulation
was
made
that
petitioner
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
ordinance
and
that
she
was
(inaudible)
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
now,
if
i
may
just
briefly
and
in
conclusion,
touch
on
the
matter
of,
what
i
thought
was
the
petitioner's
point
in
his
lawsuits
and
that
is
that
this
case
is
--
is
to
be
determined
by
the
case
of
alabama,
the
n.a.a.c.p.
versus
alabama,
recently
decided
by
this
court
wherein
this
court
held
that
the
requirement
by
court
order
for
the
revealing
of
membership
list
was
a
depravation
of
the
rights
of
the
first
amendment
and
that
as
such
would
be
void.
but
that
court
in
--
in
the
alabama
--
this
court
in
the
alabama
case
also
identified
an
exception,
namely
if
there
is
a
controlling
justification
for
an
alleged
deterrent
effect,
a
controlling
justification
barred
the
deterrent
effect
which
the
revealing
of
this
information
might
have,
then
the
court
here
will
balance
the
interest
of
the
individual.
the
constitution
gives
that
balance
between
the
individual
and
the
government
so
that
it
is
not
always
a
--
a
paramount
right
which
can
never
be
subjected
to
--
to
some
sort
of
governmental
investigatory
power
or
authority.
further,
this
court,
in
the
matter
of
a
recent
decision,
uphaus
versus
wyman,
360
u.s.,
a
1959
decision,
again
confirmed
the
holding
in
the
alabama
case
by
stating
that
and
i
quote,
"whether
there
was
justification
for
the
production,”
they
were
producing
a
list
of
the
guest
at
a
summer
camp
and
the
--
and
the
defendant
denied
that
this
was
a
proper
being
in
view
of
the
holdings
of
the
alabama
case
and
the
court
says,
"whether
there
were
justification
for
the
production
timed
on
the
substantial
question
of
the
state's
interest
in
obtaining
the
identity
of
a
guest
when
weighed
against
the
individual's
interest
asserted
by
the
fellow.
the
court
found
certainly
that
the
--
the
state
was
privileged
or
should
be
privileged
to
investigate
and
determine
whether
or
not,
there
were
communists
in
the
--
in
their
state.
i
think
unless
this
court
can
agree
that
the
state
or
the
city
of
--
whatever
political
subdivision
we
have
in
--
has
the
authority
and
the
power
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
tax
is
due,
then
that
government
will
deteriorate
without
taxation,
without
revenues,
it
just
can't
function
and
perform
and
render
the
services
which
the
public
are
entitled
to
and
demand.
therefore,
there
is
a
justification,
a
controlling
justification
for
whatever
aspect,
the
revealing
of
this
information
may
have
had
or
may
in
the
future
have.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
no.
that
is
a
point
however
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
no.
the
justification
which
i
(voice
overlap)
--
yes,
that
--
that
is
correct,
i
didn't
understand
it.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i'm
not
sure
whether
they
are
all
contained
there
in
or
not,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
would
have
no
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i'm
unable
--
by
looking
at
this,
your
honor,
to
determine
that
even
if
these
ordinances
were
identified
by
title
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
privilege
tax
ordinance
names
the
particular
activity
which
is
taxed
and
assigns
a
tax
--
lump
sum
tax.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
they
are
very
careful.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
it
depends
on
the
activity
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
--
i
could
not,
sir.
i
would
not
have
this
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
would
not
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
(attempt
to
laughter)
without
the
investigatory
authority
which
this
ordinance
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
either
that
or
they
may
very
well
want
to
levy
a
tax
on
them,
create
a
new
statute.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that
is
not
the
intent
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
if
the
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
if
it
in
fact
is
shown
by
the
information
revealed
the
city
can
conclude
that
the
n.a.a.c.p.
or
any
organization
is
in
fact
selling
merchandise,
then
they
are
charged
a
privilege
tax
in
that
instance
on
the
inventory.
i
think
that's
the
way
the
privilege
tax
ordinance
sets
it
up.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
if
the
facts
reveal
it,
then
they
would
be
taxed.
yes,
sir,
if
they
in
--
in
fact
selling
merchandise.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
not
specifically
that,
sir.
i
have
not
--
i
was
using
that
as
a
supposition.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
any
business.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
have
no
knowledge.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
--
i
would
agree
with
that
wholeheartedly,
your
honor
and
i
think
very
well
that
the
ordinance
expressed
and
made
the
justification
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that's
true.
now,
i
further
point
out,
your
honor,
that
this
--
this
privilege
tax
ordinance
we
are
referring
to
in
hereby
amendments
and
etcetera.
also
has
a
catch-all
provision
therein
wherein
it's
provided
that
in
the
event,
some
organization
for
profit
is
not
listed
herein,
that
in
no
instance
shall
be
--
be
privileged
to
conduct
that
but
that
but
it's
out
of
less
in
front
of
my
door
and
(inaudible)
so
at
least
they
could
get
$25
if
they
couldn't
identify
its
particular
activity.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
if
it
is
in
fact
a
profitable
business,
yes,
sir.
a
business
more
profitable.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
we
--
we
were
concerned
with
that
particular
question
in
view
of
the
holdings
in
the
speiser
case
under
the
first
unitarian
case
in
california,
both
of
those
cases.
we
think
that
those
cases
are
distinguishable
and
that
they
are
--
the
defendant
was
requested
in
the
speiser
case
and
that
was
reversed
to
give
an
affidavit
of
his
non-communist
for
some
expatiation
in
order
to
have
the
immunity
from
a
particular
tax.
and
the
court
--
this
court
held
as
i
recall
that
he
would
not
be
required
or
could
not
be
required
to
furnish
these
information
against
him,
that
was
to
be
used
against
him.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
or
here,
there,
the
--
the
city
is
not
attempting
to
--
to
deprive
this
man
or
the
n.a.a.c.p.
or
any
organization
of
any
right
which
is
his
or
its.
we
are
attempting
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
tax
is
proper
or
one
is
due
or
one
is
being
evaded.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
have
no
knowledge
regarding
a
section
or
a
--
a
license
ordinance,
not
in
our
city,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
pardon?
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
have
no
knowledge
of
any,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
there
are
privilege
tax
ordinances
there.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
privilege
tax
ordinance.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that,
your
honor
has
mentioned
that.
i
could
state
that
this
ordinance
does
not
provide
as
has
been
alleged
that
the
record
will
become
a
public
record
to
the
extent
that
the
curious
may
go
in
and
view
it.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
its
says
it
is
a
public
record
for
the
interested
to
view
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
arkansas
has
construed
that
term
to
mean
those
who
have
a
direct
interest,
not
something
that
someone
who
has
only
a
curious
idea
of
what
it
contain.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
of
course,
that
is
rather
abstract.
and
i
--
i
would
pay
(inaudible).
i
--
i
doubt
insistently
that
they
would
be
privileged
to
go
in
and
see
it.
and
that
they
are
not
directly
affected
by.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
duty
does
not
engage
and
it
is
not
privilege
and
to
come
and
see
it.
they
--
i
don't
--
think
it
is
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
think
they
are
not
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
--
an
interested
party.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
think
they
are
not
an
interested
party
under
the
case
of
board
versus
the
white
county
bridge
commission.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
well,
certainly,
the
contributor
would
be
of
an
interested
person.
certainly,
creditors
of
the
organization
would
--
would
be
interested
in
determining
whether
or
not
funds
were
--
were
actually
in
the
trade
business.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
he
would
like
--
might
as
well
to
see
if
his
funds
were
being
spent
as
he
had
been
told
they
would
bring
it
back.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
doubt
that
he
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
i
don't
believe
would
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
--
distinct
that
to
be
an
interested
party.
they
did
not
in
this
case
and
that
is
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
they're
on
file
with
the
city
clerk's
office,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
he
probably
wouldn't
be
able
to
see
them
unless
he
could
justify
to
the
extent
that
he
is
definitely
an
interested
person.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
don't
know
such
instance.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
--
i'd
rather
think
that
they
have
been
privileged
to
see
the
record
in
as
much
as
i've
read
it
in
the
press.
i
don't
know
and
i
answered
mr.
justice
frankfurter
here
a
moment
ago
to
say
that
i
don't
believe
that
legally,
they
would
be
an
interested
party.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
in
these
instances,
there's
a
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
the
city
clerk,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
oh,
i'm
sure
that
it's
a
discretionary
manner.
i
would
hate
to
see
it
abused,
however.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
no,
not
in
the
city
of
little
rock
since
it
now
has
the
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
--
(inaudible)
form
of
government.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
don't
think
that
i
would
be
qualified
to
make
that
determination
until
i've
been
able
to
view
the
information
furnished
under
section
e.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
because
that
is
a
self-served
declaration.
and
it's
just
going
to
state
what
the
petitioners
made
that
--
that
he's
engaged
in
the
activities
or
are
promoted
in
the
responsible
cause
of
--
advanced
in
the
statement
(inaudible)
that
we
can
all
appreciate.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
it's
entirely
possible.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
it
seems
to
me
--
would
seem
a
little
remote
with,
your
honor.
i
(inaudible)
a
moment
ago
and
was
clear
under
it
so
that
supposed
the
officers
of
the
organization
are
in
fact
the
only
contributors
to
it
and
not,
upon
their
coming
in,
reference
is
only
newspapers,
wouldn't
they?
and
upon
their
coming
from
forces
outside
the
organization
and
incidentally,
most
charitable
organizations
do
lay
as
most
of
them
might,
sources
outside
membership.
and
then,
the
funds
are
paid
out
that
are
taken
in
but
you
don't
know
to
whom
it
is
paid.
the
organization
itself,
that
is
the
(inaudible)
officers
may
very
well
be
just
taking
that
money
as
a
commission
for
a
solicitation
which
does
require
the
payment
of
previous
tax
in
little
rock.
solicitant
and
for
the
clients.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
well,
in
your
situation,
$252
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
which
one
is
it?
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
you're
reading
from
north
little
rock.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that
is
appreciable
larger
sum.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
i
suppose
i
can't
answer
the
question.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
well,
i'm
sure
that
is
(inaudible)
suggest.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
not
under
our
order,
your
honor.
no,
sir.
we
have
that
--
that
privilege
under
this
ordinance.
i
think
that
the
intent
of
this
particular
ordinance
under
consideration
here
that's
in
the
--
that
or
the
ordinance,
was
to
aid
in
assessing
the
tax
if
in
fact
one
is
due
but
not
to
assess
it
unless
they
determine
that
one
was
really
due
and
was
--
and
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
avoid
to
paying
that.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
--
i
did
not
say
that.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
well,
i
--
i
think
that
we're
referring
to
monetary
profit,
your
honor,
when
we
talked
about
the
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
assuming
that
is
the
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
would
assume
not
if
that
picture
right
there
were
in
fact
true
--
true
picture.
i
would
assume
there
would
be
not
tax.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
they
would
not
be
indeed
in
a
profit
venture.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
well,
i
don't
concern
that
--
i
would
not
do
that
to
be
a
profit
and
that
--
and
that
it's
paid
out
in
salaries.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
it
very
well
maybe.
i
--
i
could
not
say.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
if
i
accept
their
statement,
what
they
do
as
being
final
then
i'll
agree
with
you
that
there
is
probably
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
came
under
this
ordinance
otherwise
not.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i'm
saying
that
that's
the
information
they
revealed
here
as
to
be
their
activity.
it
--
it's
taken
on
its
face
value.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
cannot
say
that
there
is
a
profit
made
in
view
of
the
brief.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
well,
then
if
it
is
in
fact
carried
on
for
the
benefit
of
a
profit
or
someone
to
--
to
make
a
profit,
then
in
fact,
there
is
tax
due,
yes.
but
this
is
an
organizational
figure
here,
it
doesn't
show
that
--
that
anyone
in
particular
has
received
it.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
would
assume
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
i
would
assume
under
the
catch-all
ordinance.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
it's
in
the
ordinance
itself,
7444,
the
original
ordinance.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
it's
in
the
original
transcript
at
the
clerk's
office.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
7437.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes,
sir.
that's
the
basic
ordinance.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
it
required
that
that
information
be
given,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
and
that
information
was
given.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
oh,
no.
it
was
not
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
they
--
they
have
given
--
i'm
assuming
that
the
person
or
persons
who
made
the
request
were
satisfied
with
the
information
furnished
accepting
as
to
itself
section
e.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
may
i
--
i
was
going
to
ask
if
i
could
correct
the
statement
on
this,
your
honor
but
i
--
i
do
not
--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
in
reference
to
that
catch-all
clause
it
is
specific
with
--
in
reference
to
organizations
engaging
in
the
business
of
selling
of
goods,
wares
and
merchandise,
whether
raw
materials
or
finished
product
or
both,
says
that
in
no
instance
shall
any
such
activity
being
privileged
to
do
business
more
or
less
than
$25
of
the
tax.
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that's
(voice

--
mr.
joseph
c.
kemp
that
--
that
catch-all
and
i
would
--
i
just
--
just
doesn't
--
i
wanted
to
--
