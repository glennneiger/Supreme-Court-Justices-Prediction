mr.
samuel
lang
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
was
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
jones
and
lachman
case
upholding
the
wagner
act.
that
it
was
said
that
it
would
be
to
ignore
the
plainest
facts
of
our
industrial
life
to
hold
that
manufacturing
was
not
an
interstate
commerce
affecting
interstate
commerce
or
something
to
that
effect.
and
i
would
like
to
borrow
that
language
to
point
to
the
situation
in
which
the
company
found
itself
in
this
case,
the
plainest
facts
of
our
industrial
life
in
the
negotiation
of
labor
agreements,
or
that
a
union
is
striving
to
take
and
a
company
is
striving
to
hold.
it's
important
to
recognize
that
in
the
situation
which
we
have
before
the
court
today.
what
was
the
company
striving
to
hold
here?
for
18
years
from
its
inception
in
1940,
it
had
exercised
the
practice
of
contracting
out
work.
during
the
last
six
years
of
that
period
up
to
the
time
of
this
controversy
in
1958,
it
had
contracts
at
least
two,
possibly
several,
record
shows
only
two
with
this
union.
in
the
course
of
which,
it
had
continued
this
practice
of
contracting
out
work
against
the
vigorous
opposition
of
the
union
during
the
negotiation
of
those
contracts
and
against
the
vigorous
silence
of
the
union
during
the
operation
of
those
contracts.
now,
the
fact
that
the
naked
contract
does
not
give
us
the
right
to
contract
our
this
work,
only
means
that
in
the
plainest
facts
of
our
industrial
life,
it
is
rare
that
a
company
can
afford
to
take
the
years
of
shutdown
due
to
strikes
in
order
to
obtain
the
negative
provisions
of
a
contract
which
be
--
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
change
the
language
of
this
agreement.
the
union
asked
for
affirmative
provisions
and
for
negative
provisions
negatively.
the
company
tries
to
keep
out
of
the
contract,
things
which
will
change
its
practices
which
have
been
accepted.
everything
that
the
union
and
the
company
did,
all
of
its
objective
conduct
throughout
the
period
involved
here
and
in
connection
with
the
handling
and
administration
of
this
arbitration
agreement
which
is
all
we're
talking
about
here,
this
arbitration
agreement,
pointed
to
a
pronounced
acceptance
by
both
sides
of
the
fact
that
so
far
as
contracting
out
work
was
concerned,
it
was
an
untouchable.
the
union
couldn't
touch
it
and
the
arbitrator
couldn't
touch
it.
now,
this
is
not
a
shipyard,
about
which
we
are
talking
here.
this
is
a
transportation
company.
the
maintenance
and
repair
of
its
vessels
and
barges
is
and
always
has
been
only
incidental
to
its
business
up
until
the
time
that
world
war
ii
took
away
its
equipment
and
made
it
necessary
that
it
reequip
its
operations.
it
had
the
same
type
of
skeleton
force
which
it
now
has
and
to
which
it
reverted
after
it
had
completed
a
special
period
of
operations
which
due
to
the
nature
of
the
vessels
which
had
been
built
under
its
own
direction
and
engineering.
and
due
to
the
mistakes
which
had
been
made,
calling
for
repowering
and
important
changes,
had
called
for
a
larger
work
force.
the
record
makes
it
clear
that
at
no
time
during
the
18
years
including
the
six
years
in
which
the
company
and
the
union
had
these
contracts
has
there
been
any
deviation
from
the
practice.
the
company
laid
off
employees
before
it
had
the
contracts
with
the
union
while
contracting
out
work.
mr.
samuel
lang
the
unit
is
the
--
the
maintenance
employees,
mechanics
and
helpers
and
also
certain
harbor
tug
employees.
it's
not
confined
to
maintenance
employees.
mr.
samuel
lang
some
are
aboard
harbor
tugs.
there
are
five
contracts
all
told,
three
of
them
with
the
petitioner
here.
this
particular
contract
discovered
the
shop
employees,
the
maintenance
employees
plus
some
fringe
employees
who
are
aboard
tugs.
mr.
samuel
lang
relatively
small,
sir.
i
think
that
at
this
time,
probably
in
the
neighborhood
of
40
to
50
but
that's
not
in
the
record.
now,
in
the
execution
of
this
maintenance
work,
as
i
said,
it
always
has
--
and
contracted
out
this
work.
mr.
samuel
lang
i
beg
you
pardon,
sir?
mr.
samuel
lang
it's
contracted
out
to
ship
repair
yards
in
the
immediate
vicinity.
mr.
samuel
lang
they
are
expressly
joining.
they
are
--
they
are
shipyards
exclusively,
equipped
to
perform
at
a
moment's
notice
any
and
all
types
of
ship
repair
work.
this
yard
was
a
small
yard
with
very
limited
facilities
and
it
had
to
give
a
certain
amount
of
its
business
to
the
shipyards
for
the
very
practical
reason
in
addition
to
the
economy
of
not
having
to
buy
all
its
equipment
for
itself
for
the
very
practical
reason
that
if
it
didn't
give
a
steady
flow
of
work
in
his
other
shipyards,
they
wouldn't
do
the
work
which
they
alone
could
do
when
the
time
came
and
there
when
needed.
now,
the
practice
as
i
say
of
contracting
out
continued
unbroken
and
--
and
that
the
record
shows
conclusively
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
as
it
always
had
been
done.
moreover,
both
before
and
after
the
contracts
with
the
union,
the
company
laid
off
the
employees
while
continuing
to
contract
out
work
without
complaint
by
the
union.
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
almost
two
years
after
the
grieving
employees
had
been
laid
off,
and
after
the
last
contract
had
been
signed
before
the
union
or
the
employees
filed
its
grievance.
so
when
the
matter
was
presented
to
the
court,
and
the
court
conceived
as
it
did
that
it
had
the
responsibility
under
section
301
to
determine
whether
this
was
an
arbitrable
issue.
whether
the
parties
had
contracted
to
submit
this
issue
to
arbitration,
and
in
that
respect,
i
disagree
with
mr.
feller
in
response
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
when
the
court
was
asked
to
decide
whether
this
issue
violated
the
promise
to
arbitrate
and
it
conceived
its
duty
to
decide
that
under
section
301,
it
decided
it
in
the
purest
form
of
contract
interpretation,
one
which
has
been
recognized
and
accepted
by
our
courts
to
this
day
and
on
a
very
broad
and
uniform
basis.
now,
as
this
court
has
had
occasion
from
time
to
time
to
point
out,
and
as
professor
cox
on
whom
we
all
seem
to
be
relying
in
this
case.
mr.
samuel
lang
well,
in
this
case,
sir,
he
supports
us
almost
right
down
to
the
last
teeth.
mr.
samuel
lang
[laughs]
mr.
samuel
lang
but
this
court
and
professor
cox
both
have
said
on
occasion
that
the
mere
fact
that
this
is
a
labor
agreement,
which
we're
interpreting
here,
doesn't
mean
that
we
have
to
abandon
all
the
principles
which
we
have
followed
in
all
these
years
in
the
interpretation
of
labor
agreements.
mr.
samuel
lang
yes,
sir.
now
frankly,
the
--
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
overwhelming.
it's
overwhelming
because
--
and
i
may
be
wrong
again.
up
until
a
few
month
--
a
few
minutes
ago,
i
don't
think
that
mr.
feller
acknowledged
what
he
did
acknowledge
at
that
time
that
it
was
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide
arbitrability.
now,
nowhere
in
the
record
does
it
appear,
or
rather
that
be
--
it
was
for
the
court
to
determine
arbitrability,
i'm
sorry.
nowhere
does
it
appear
explicitly
in
the
record
that
the
union
took
the
position
that
it
was
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide
arbitrability
but
i
challenge
anyone
to
read
the
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
the
petitioner
without
reaching
the
conclusion
that
his
argument
is
that
only
the
arbitrator
may
determine
arbitrability.
and
the
reason
that
that
is
clearly
shown,
the
proof
in
the
pudding
is
the
fact
that
the
union
walked
into
the
district
court,
moved
for
summary
judgment,
sat
down
and
did
not
make
any
attempt
in
this
record,
not
one
iota
of
attempt
to
prove
what
the
parties
had
agreed
to
but
instead
tried
to
throw
the
smokescreen
of
the
merit
idea
into
the
case
by
itself
going
into
the
merits.
now,
it
is
important
that
i
distinguish
at
this
point
between
the
merits
in
the
merits.
the
merits
that
we
are
talking
about
and
to
which
we
address
ourselves
and
on
which
the
court
made
its
finding
are
these.
number
one,
there's
nothing
in
the
contact
that
prohibits
subcontracting.
that's
an
indication
of
something
why,
why
isn't
there
anything
in
the
contract
that
doesn't
refer
to
contracting
out.
number
two,
because
the
parties
have
talked
about
it
and
decided
and
agreed
that
they
shall
not
interfere
with
the
company's
right
to
contract
out.
number
four,
because
there
is
great
silence
throughout
the
administration
of
these
contracts
when
the
company
exercises
this
practice
of
contracting
out.
and
number
five,
because
management
rights
mean
something
here
and
i
want
to
speak
to
that
subject
for
a
while
too.
in
other
words,
what
we
wanted
to
do
when
we
went
into
the
merits
of
the
issue
of
the
controversy
was
to
show
what
the
parties
by
their
objective
conduct
had
done
and
said,
and
themselves
said
they
understood
the
contract
to
mean.
but
when
the
union
put
on
its
case,
it
didn't
want
to
go
into
all
that
because
it
contended
as
it
clearly
does
in
its
brief
here
that
any
claim
makes
the
matter
arbitrable.
therefore,
we
don't
have
to
go
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
party
has
exhibited
their
intentions
or
understanding
as
to
the
contract.
they
--
instead
of
assuming
the
burden
which
i
think
i
heard
mr.
feller
admit
that
he
had.
instead
of
assuming
the
burden
of
proving
to
the
court's
satisfaction
that
this
issue
was
arbitrable,
it
went
into
the
merits
of
the
grievance,
the
second
kind
of
merits.
now,
what
are
those
merits?
those
merits
are,
and
here
is
all
the
testimony
--
oh
exclusively
the
testimony
of
the
--
of
the
union
that
joe
smith
had
done
work
on
the
bottoms
at
warrior
&
gulf's
yard
and
he
also
had
done
work
on
the
bottoms
at
the
harrison
brothers
yard,
the
company
to
which
the
company
had
contracted
out
some
work.
and
he
could
do
work
at
the
warrior
&
gulf
yard
which
he
also
did
at
the
harrison
brothers
yard,
and
that
a
foreman
who
came
around
and
--
and
laid
out
their
work
in
the
warrior
&
gulf
yard
also
went
around
and
marked
with
the
yellow
chalk
the
work
to
be
done
at
the
harrison
brothers
yard.
therefore,
what
we
were
doing
was,
we
were
giving
to
harrison
brothers
work
which
these
laid-off
employees
could
do
in
our
own
yard.
now,
that
is
a
horse
of
an
entirely
different
color.
those
are
the
merits
of
the
grievance.
those
are
the
things
which
the
arbitrator
will
decide
if
your
honors
decide
that
this
case
shall
go
to
arbitration.
we
say
the
management
rights
clause
means
something.
mr.
feller
says
it
means
nothing.
mr
feller
says
you
could
leave
that
out
of
the
contract
and
on
this
--
and
to
this
extent
we
agree
with
him
because
management
always
has
the
right
to
exercise
management
rights.
he
interprets
that
to
mean
that
management
has
the
right
to
fire
a
man.
and
the
union
has
the
right
to
grieve
about
the
firing
of
that
man.
management
has
the
right
to
cut
the
hours
of
work
and
the
union
has
the
right
to
file
a
grievance
about
it.
but
there's
one
thing
wrong
with
that
idea.
this
management
rights
clause
contain
the
express
provision
that
management's
rights
shall
be
not
arbitrable,
not
subject
to
arbitration.
now,
that
must
mean
something.
that
can't
merely
mean
that
management
having
the
right
to
fire
a
man,
the
union
having
a
right
to
grieve
that
the
fact
of
firing
shall
not
be
arbitrable
but
the
justification
for
the
firing
shall
not
be
--
shall
--
shall
be
arbitrable
where
the
fact
of
firing
shall
not
be
arbitrable
but
the
justification
for
the
firing
shall
be
arbitrable.
you
can't
mean
that,
it
would
be
a
waste
of
language.
and
incidentally,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
did
not
negotiate
this
contract
either
and
--
mr.
samuel
lang
[laughs]
mr.
samuel
lang
i
came
to
the
case
long
after
the
contract
was
negotiated.
so
we
say
that
--
that
that
language
means
something
and
that
the
court
had
the
right
to
construe
it
along
with
the
rest
of
the
language
of
the
arbitration
agreement.
we
also
think
it
is
quite
important
to
note
the
order
in
which
these
provisions
appear
in
the
contract.
the
first
thing
that
it
said
is,
“management
rights
shall
not
be
arbitrable.”
and
then
it
says
“differences
and
as
to
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
contract
shall
be
arbitrable.”
now,
what
does
this
mean?
what
does
this
“management
right
shall
not
be
arbitrable”
mean?
i
don't
think
anyone
will
disagree
that
there
has
been
a
lot
of
confusion
about
the
meaning
of
the
term
management
rights.
that
there
has
been
a
lot
of
difference
of
opinion
between
management
people
as
to
whether
they
ought
to
put
a
management
rights
provision
into
a
contract
or
not
to
put
one
in
a
contract
and
the
main
area
of
disagreement
is
over
whether
the
failure
to
cover
everything
means
that
they
have
thereby
given
up
some
things
which
they
really
had.
but
uniformly,
students,
management
and
labor
people
agree
that
the
management
rights
clause
is
there
for
the
purpose
of
holding
--
holding
on
to
the
practices
which
they
have.
we
are
reserving,
retaining
our
rights
in
our
practices.
and
that
is
so
well
accepted
in
the
philosophy
of
management
people
in
any
rate
and
we
have
cited
the
(inaudible)
in
our
brief
to
that
effect
and
also
some
management
--
american
management
association
and
so
on
authorities
to
that
respect.
that
in
seeking
to
put
in
language
which
again
is
inartistic,
the
reservation
from
arbitration
of
those
practices
in
which
they
have
been
engaged,
they
sometimes
get
this
provision
which
we
report
doesn't
have
to
get
in
our
contract
that
those
management
rights
shall
not
be
arbitrable.
so
--
mr.
samuel
lang
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
lang
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
lang
sir,
i
would
not
give
10
cents
--
mr.
samuel
lang
i
would
not
give
10
cents
for
my
chances
in
a
case
of
that
kind.
i
--
we
--
all
we
have
to
rely
in
this
case
upon
the
conduct,
the
objective
conduct
of
the
parties.we
have
to.
i
think
that
if
--
that
if
our
situation
were
--
had
absent
the
conditions
which
have
been
described
and
we
have
the
naked
contract
here
and
nothing
more
that
we
wouldn't
have
a
chance
before
your
honors.
mr.
samuel
lang
no,
sir,
not
necessarily
because
i
think
in
that
case,
you
would
have
something
more
closer
to
the
u.s.
(inaudible)
case
which
is
pending
before
your
honors
on
application
for
certiorari
where
there
was
not
any
negotiation
history
and
where
there
was
actually
a
grievance
filed
in
--
in
the
prior
history.
where
--
where
you
have
the
naked
contract
in
the
management
rights
clause,
i
don't
think
that
we
could
rely
upon
the
management
rights
clause
to
say
that
this
is
a
reserved
right
of
management
which
we
have
here
if
we
did
not
have
the
history
of
the
parties'
conduct
because
--
mr.
samuel
lang
well,
i
think
--
mr.
samuel
lang
--
that
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
lang
i
think
that's
correct
but
for
this
reason
--
mr.
samuel
lang
no,
sir.
i
understand.
i
think
that's
correct
and
i
think
that
in
even
in
our
case
that
he's
deciding
the
merits
of
the
case
as
a
matter
of
--
of
effect.
i
mean
that
the
end
result
is
that
he's
disposing
of
the
case.
mr.
samuel
lang
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
lang
that
he
had
nothing
more
in
the
contract
or
nothing
more
before
him
except
--
mr.
samuel
lang
--
which
would
be
exactly
like
ours.
mr.
samuel
lang
then
--
and
he
decides
it
was
not
arbitrable,
he
would
have
to
pass
upon
the
management
rights
clause
if
he
relied
up
on
that
--
mr.
samuel
lang
--
purely
and
simply
in
his
interpretation
of
that
provision
without
reference
to
anything
the
parties
had
indicated
to
be
their
intent.
and
i
think
that
he
would
be
on
dangerous
grounds.
and
that
brings
me
to
this
question
and
mr.
feller
has
suggested
that
this
case
is
more
difficult.
i
will
go
a
bit
further,
it's
a
difficult
case.
and
i
say
that
with
full
awareness
of
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
said
during
the
course
of
this
argument
that
we
have
an
institution
of
arbitration
which
is
highly
desirable.
and
it's
highly
desirable
that
we
not
injure
the
process.
at
the
same
time,
it's
highly
desirable
that
it
not
be
injured
by
discrediting
it
by
making
management
feel,
to
have
a
feeling
of
frustration,
by
making
it
take
long
strikes
and
battle
over
getting
this
negative
language
into
the
contracts
which
further
cripples
the
arbitration
process.
now,
if
the
management
knows,
and
this
addresses
itself
to
the
question
of
public
policy
because
we
very
strongly
feel
that
it
will
advance
the
cause
of
arbitration
if
the
court
decides
to
affirm
the
circuit
court.
for
this
reason,
management
is
very
touchy
and
sensitive.
professor
cox
has
pointed
that
out
about
arbitration.
there
is
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
management
is
wary
and
distrustful
of
arbitration
and
the
reasons
are
--
are
evident.
the
fact
is
that
if
management
is
told
in
a
situation
of
this
kind,
you
--
the
only
way
to
protect
yourself,
and
we
say
that
management
did
everything
it
possible
could
to
get
this
interpretation
into
the
agreement
and
into
the
life
of
the
parties.
that
if
--
if
the
management
has
told
that
in
this
type
of
case
it
has
no
protection
that
an
arbitrator
can
come
along
and
decide
on
the
basis
of
an
interpretation
of
seniority
clause
that
it
had
no
right
to
contract
out
this
work
or
any
part
of
it
and
management
is
going
to
be
told
that
it
has
got
to
get
into
the
contract,
something
to
further
limit
arbitration.
it's
got
to
perhaps
be
conservative
and
go
so
far
as
to
have
no
arbitration
in
the
agreement.
and
that
certainly
is
not
a
healthy
condition.
what
we
are
contending
for
here
is
and
this,
i
think,
is
awfully
important
to
the
court.
what
we
are
contending
for
here
is
that
the
federal
district
courts
be
allowed
to
look
at
the
question
of
arbitrability
in
the
light
of
the
real
situation
existing
between
the
parties
and
where
that
court
finds
that
the
party
is
clearly
exhibited
as
they
did
here,
an
intent
not
to
put
contracting
out
in
the
area
of
arbitration,
then
not
let
someone
come
in
the
backdoor
and
yes,
through
an
arbitrator
of
what
he
couldn't
get
in
bargaining
and
what
he
didn't
object
to
all
the
while
it
was
going
on
in
the
practice.
mr.
samuel
lang
i
think
that
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
sir.
i
--
i
see
a
difference.
it
is
a
--
it's
a
difference
on
paper
only
though
as
i
see
it.
what
it
is
saying
is
now,
we
don't
--
we
don't
say
that
we
will
object
to
all
of
the
contracting
out
of
work.
we
only
want
the
right
to
veto
that
which
we
don't
like.
but
that
language
in
a
contract
to
an
employer
can
only
have
one
meaning.
it
means
he
can't
ever
contract
out
work
without
getting
the
permission
of
the
union
in
advance.
mr.
samuel
lang
well
--
mr.
samuel
lang
you'll
have
to
ask
--
you
have
ask
me
a
double
question,
sir
and
i'd
have
to
answer
in
two
parts.first
of
all,
i
have
never
heard
anyone
say
anything
but
the
kindest
and
most
praiseworthy
things
of
the
dean
shulman,
mr.
cole
and
--
and
some
of
the
others
who
had
national
statute.
mr.
samuel
lang
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
lang
yes
sir,
i
--
and
i
--
mr.
samuel
lang
and
--
and
i
know
that's
true,
that
--
that
to
be
true,
a
good
many
other
arbitrators
too.
but
unfortunately,
there
are
so
many
thousands
of
these
cases
that
those
who
have
this
national
statute
and
in
this
fine
reputation
are
not
available
in
all
of
them.
and
--
and
a
great
many
of
them,
you
asked
an
opinion,
i
will
give
it
for
whatever
its
worth
and
a
great
many
of
them,
employers
and
some
unions
feel
that
they
are
merely
trading
cases.
that
they
want
to
be
appointed
in
each
of
the
cases
so
they'll
decide
one
for
the
union
one
day
and
one
for
the
employer
the
next
day.
life
--
fortune
magazine
had
an
article
to
that
affect
a
year
or
two
ago.
moreover,
some
employers
feel
that
some
arbitrators
are
influenced
by
the
fact
that
they
can't
gain
continued
employ
--
appointments
unless
they
decide
cases
a
certain
way.
they
get
reputations
for
deciding
discharge
cases
in
certain
way
and
seniority
cases
in
certain
way
and
so
on.
nonetheless,
the
fact
remains
that
employers
are
distrustful
as
a
general
rule
of
arbitrators
and
that
they
have
known
of
some
unions
to
be
distrustful
of
arbitrators
and
to
want
to
avoid
arbitration.
mr.
samuel
lang
that's
right,
sir.
[laughs]
mr.
samuel
lang
it's
not
bad
if
the
right
one
is
decided
for
me.
[laughter]
the
--
the
question
of
the
quid
pro
quo.
it
deserves
some
comment
also.
the
union
seems
to
feel
here
that
it's
helpless
if
--
with
this
no-strike
clause,
if
it
doesn't
have
the
right
to
arbitrate
this
grievance.
that
--
that
phrase
in
the
lincoln
mills
case
doesn't
mean
what
mr.
feller
says
it
means
at
all.
obviously,
it
doesn't.
mr.
justine
who
is
also
a
national
arbitrator
and
who
is
a
professor
at
new
york
university,
has
written
an
article,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
he
has
very
clearly
shown
that
the
quid
pro
quo
is
the
absolute
no-strike
clause
and
the
wide-open,
all-inclusive
arbitration
clause
which
is
very
common.
the
--
the
use
of
the
term
“conventional
clause
and
standard
clause”
is
not
to
be
taken
to
mean
that
that
clause
appears
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
union
contract.
that's
not
at
all
true.
in
fact,
a
great
many
employers
as
well
as
a
great
many
unions
want
the
wide-open
clause
because
they
want
to
be
sure
that
they're
not
even
any
wildcat
strikes.
they
want
to
be
sure
that
everything
is
arbitrable.
larger
companies
particularly,
they
want
to
be
sure
that
there's
no
contention
of
arbitrability
by
the
union
or
by
the
employer.
so
the
wide-open
clause
is
a
very
popular
clause,
it
has
a
lot
of
reason
and
merit
to
it.
this
conventional
clause
as
professor
cox
has
said
and
i
would
like
to
take
the
time
to
read
to
the
court
what
he
has
said
about
it.
“it
is
a
clause
of
very
limited
jurisdiction
on
the
arbitrator.”
it
means
that
--
it
says
what
the
arbitrator
may
not
do.
it
has
implications
of
holding
that
arbitrator
to
the
specific
provisions
of
the
contract.
professor
cox
has
said
and
we
quote
him
on
page
32
in
footnote
37
in
the
latter
half
of
the
footnote.
"i
am
persuaded
that
the
conventional
arbitration
clause
is
not
an
agreement
to
allow
an
arbitrator
to
interpret
its
meaning
thereby
determining
its
own
jurisdiction.
the
contrast
between
the
wide-open
clause
and
a
conventional
phraseology
is
too
plain
to
be
put
down
to
in
inadvertence.”
apparently,
the
parties
choose
it
because
one
party,
usually
the
employer,
discuss
arbitration
at
least
to
the
point
of
insisting
upon
the
inclusion
of
some
safeguard
against
the
arbitrators
imposing
significant
obligations
not
contemplated
by
the
agreement
and
beyond
its
scope.
this
clause
tells
what
the
arbitrator
cannot
do.
the
protection
sought
by
the
employer
would
be
drastically
reduced
by
construction
which
give
the
arbitrator
unlimited
jurisdiction
and
merely
won
against
this
exercise.
now
here,
the
rest
of
the
clause
goes
on
to
make
a
distinction
which
i
started
to
make
a
moment
ago.
we're
asking
the
court
to
let
the
federal
district
court
subject
to
the
review
of
the
circuit
courts
and
this
court
to
let
the
district
courts
look
at
what
the
parties
have
done
and
what
they
have
intended
to
determine
arbitrability.
in
cases
of
substance
i
might
add,
in
other
words,
to
let
the
--
to
let
the
federal
district
courts
and
we
suggest
that
congress
so
intended,
look
at
substantial
cases
of
this
kind
and
make
the
decision
as
to
arbitrability.
and
once
the
question
is
fairly
clear
that
it
is
arbitrable,
then
the
general
power
of
the
arbitrator
and
this
i
submit
is
the
difference
between
mr.
feller
and
myself.
the
general
power
of
the
arbitrator
then
comes
into
place.
and
he
may
roll
all
over
the
ballpark
with
all
the
provisions
in
it.
he
may
say
that
something
which
appears
to
be
ridiculously
related
to
some
provision,
nonetheless,
is
governed
by
it.
that's
his
province
and
we
can't
complain
because
we've
given
him
the
power
to
do
so.
but
to
the
point
of
giving
him
power,
we
think
the
district
courts
have
got
to
have
the
authority
to
make
the
determination.
that
since
301
alone
is
responsible
for
that
authority,
we
have
to
look
at
what
3
--
how
301
was
adopted
and
what
it
stands
for.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
the
legislative
history
of
301
puts
in
the
federal
district
court
the
power
to
do
the
things
which
it
did
here.
i
--
i
well
understand
and
well
appreciate
the
super
--
superimposition
upon
that
of
our
acceptance
of
arbitrary
--
of
arbitration
and
the
importance
of
arbitration
in
this
field.but
nonetheless,
if
we
don't
have
the
judicial
protection
of
what
we
think
we
have
negotiated
and
in
the
way
of
arbitrability.
and
i'm
delimiting
my
argument
entirely
to
that
in
the
way
of
what
we
--
what
power
we
have
given
to
the
arbitrator.
if
we
don't
have
judicial
protection
for
that,
then
we
are
going
to
have
to
go
in
our
negotiation
to
a
provision
which
outlaws
arbitration
in
either
in
absolute
form
or
in
limited
form.
and
that
would
be
a
highly
undesirable
result.
mr.
feller's
premise
is
that
we
don't
have
and
can't
have
this
judicial
protection.
that
anytime
in
the
complaint,
and
i
don't
care
how
he
close
it
and
how
he
seeks
to
get
around
it.
he
is
nonetheless
making
this
statement
in
his
brief.
he's
making
it
in
his
argument
and
it
is
inescapable
that
his
position
is,
that
anytime
a
claim
is
made
however
ridiculous,
it's
arbitrable.
now,
we
--
we
can't
conceive,
of
a
holding
which
would
deprive
us
of
what
we
have
negotiated
with
this
union
and
what
we
have,
how
we
have
lived
with
this
union
on
the
question
of
the
extent
of
the
power
to
be
given
to
the
arbitrator.
that's
very
important.
without
it,
we
have
not
negotiated
a
contract.
all
the
no-strike
clauses
in
the
world
won't
do
us
any
good
if
the
arbitrator
may
arbitrate
any
and
every
claim.
we
have
no
protection
whatsoever.
all
of
our
efforts
to
--
to
limit
this
rolling
all
over
the
ballpark
have
gone
for
naught.
so
much
of
what
is
in
our
brief
and
what
i
prepared
for
argument
is
concerned
with
the
power
of
the
court
which
counsel
has
acknowledged
is
there
that
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
go
into
the
legislative
history,
into
the
national
policy
as
reflected
by
the
railway
labor
act
and
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
as
shown
by
the
jacobs
manufacturing
company
case
and
--
and
in
it's
other
interpretation
of
that
act
going
to
show
that
this
a
voluntary
consensual
agreement,
that
is
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
i
repeatedly
--
and
i
repeatedly
emphasized
the
difference
between
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
the
other
provisions
of
the
contract
and
that
the
interpretation
which
has
always
been
given
to
these
agreements
to
arbitrate.
in
the
railway
labor
act,
under
the
administration
of
the
railroad
adjustment
board
and
the
national
mediation
board
and
--
and
elsewhere
in
our
national
policy
dealing
with
arbitration
has
been
to
give
a
wide
scope
to
the
district
courts
in
their
construction
of
what
the
parties
have
agreed
to
arbitrate.
the
attempt
--
the
attempt
by
counsel
to
merge
the
warrior
&
gulf
case
into
the
american
and
enterprise
(inaudible)
cases,
must
be
rejected.
now,
our
case
is
not
only
a
more
difficult
one,
it's
an
entirely
different
case.
here,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out,
we
are
striking
at
the
threshold
of
the
arbitrator's
jurisdiction,
of
the
arbitrator's
authority.
in
those
other
cases,
we
are
dealing
with
matters
which
are
not
concerned
with
the
power
of
the
district
court
as
such.
that
is
the
power
conferred
by
section
301
as
i
conceive
it.
we're
dealing
with
the
power
of
the
district
court
in
both
of
these
cases
to
interfere
when
the
functions
of
the
arbitrator.
that's
my
conception
of
the
basic
difference
between
our
case
and
the
other
cases.
so
we
have
here
an
entirely
unrelated
case
except
to
the
extent
that
you
may
say
that
it
all
involves
arbitration
and
such
arbitration
is
a
very
salutary
institution,
we
should
treat
all
these
cases
as
the
same
as
one
and
--
one
and
the
same
involving
the
same
principles.
but
there
is
--
there
is
such
a
vast
difference
particularly
when
we
have
the
--
the
admission
that
the
union
had
the
burden
of
proving
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
that
we
could
and
should
take
the
warrior
&
gulf
case
entirely
out
of
the
realm
of
consideration
of
the
other
two
cases.
i
don't
think
it
necessary
and
our
brief
treats
this
in
some
detail
to
point
out
that
although
arbitrators
have
relied
upon
the
recognition
clause
and
the
lock-out
clause,
and
the
seniority
clause
and
the
discrimination
clause
and
so
forth
and
so
on
in
making
decisions
on
--
on
apparently
unrelated
subjects.
i
don't
think
it
necessary
to
point
out
that
that
subject
is
a
apart
and
aside
from
what
we're
talking
about
here
because
of
the
conduct
of
the
parties.
if
we
didn't
have
the
objective
conduct
of
the
parties
here
in
which
they
paid
no
attention
to
these
provisions
in
sustaining
and
agreeing
to
in
acquiescing
in
the
company's
right
to
contract
out
work,
then
i
would
i
admit
that
these
provisions
--
these
other
provisions
of
the
contract,
could
be
examined
and
inquired
into.
as
a
part
from
the
fact
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief
that
their
origins,
there
genesis
are
in
different
situations
entirely.
the
court
has
dealt
with
labor
problems
from
many
more
years
than
i
have
and
is
much
more
familiar
than
i
am
with
the
origins,
the
provisions
of
this
kind.
these
provisions
don't
have
any
direct
connection
with
contracting
out
work.
each
one
them
has
in
argument,
a
different
situation.
lock-out
for
example,
the
court
treated
with
in
the
buffalo
linen
case.
if
that's
a
pure
type,
that's
a
lock-out
situation
where
an
employer
shuts
down
to
bring
economic
pressure
upon
employees
in
order
to
get
them
to
do
or
not
do
something
in
connection
with
their
union
activity
or
negotiations.
we
don't
have
a
situation
here
of
discrimination.
we
don't
have
a
situation
here
of
depriving
certain
people
of
seniority
in
preference
to
others.
we
don't
have
a
lack
of
recognition
of
the
union
here.
we
had
all
union
employees,
all
of
these
--
all
of
these
employees,
all
of
our
wage
earners
are
covered
by
union
contracts,
five
of
them.
and
our,
union
our
members
are
prone
in
number,
the
record
shows
from
the
inception
of
our
relations
with
the
union.
we
didn't
have
a
condition
here
which
--
which
should
be
related
to
any
of
these
provisions.
mr.
samuel
lang
and
subsequent
to
it.
mr.
samuel
lang
the
proposal?
mr.
samuel
lang
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
lang
i
do
draw
the
distinction
for
this
reason.
the
proposal
that
is
made
is
an
attempt
to
change
and
accept
the
practice.
now,
that
is
objective
conduct
stated
at
a
time
when
the
party
making
the
proposal
recognizes
that
he
has
accepted
the
practice.
and
when
that
proposal
is
rejected
and
he
continues
to
accept
the
practice
without
filing
a
grievance,
it
confirms
his
understanding
of
what
he
and
the
employer
have
agreed
to.
mr.
samuel
lang
well,
i
don't
--
no,
sir.
i
don't
make
any
distinction.
i
misunderstood
you,
sir,
between
a
verbal
proposal
and
a
(voice
overlap)
clauses.
mr.
samuel
lang
no,
sir.
i
don't.
mr.
samuel
lang
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
lang
yes,
sir.
we
emphasize
in
closing
two
basic
points.
number
one,
the
court
here
construed
this
contract
as
it
not
only
had
the
right
to
do,
but
as
it
had
the
duty
to
do
under
section
301.
it
couldn't
have
avoided
construing
this
contract
in
any
other
way.
that
its
--
its
conclusion,
its
findings
are
based
upon
the
finest
traditions
of
our
law
in
contract
interpretation.
and
incidentally,
the
finest
traditions
of
our
arbitration
law,
and
i've
cited
to
speak
of
nationally
known
arbitrators.
i
cited
the
case
which
mr.
--
mr.
peter
(inaudible),
who
is
equally
as
well
accepted
nationally
as
the
other
gentleman
in
which
he
said
he
found
no
case
in
which
they
had
done
a
decision
contrary
to
that,
similar
to
the
decision
of
the
court
in
our
case
and
the
facts
weren't
all
for
us
in
that
case.
i've
cited
the
case
in
our
brief.
the
principles
which
arbitrators
rely
upon
to
a
very
large
extent
are
all
those
which
this
court
relied
upon.
professor
cox
emphasized
past
practice,
emphasized
the
conduct
to
the
parties.
the
court
emphasized
those
things
here.
the
second
basic
point
on
which
we
rely
is
that,
this
decision
is
good
for
arbitration,
that
this
decision
is
good,
for
our
industrial
relations.
that
if
we
have
a
decision
which
rejects
the
theory
of
our
case,
that
it
is
going
to
hurt.
the
union
may
have
won
the
war,
but
it
will
have
lost
the
case.
thank
you,
sir.
