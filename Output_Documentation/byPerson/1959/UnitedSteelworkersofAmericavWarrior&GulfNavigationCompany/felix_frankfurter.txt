justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
may
i
ask
you
before
you
state
the
defense.
what,
if
you
read
the
exact
scope
of
the
arbitration
undertaking,
what
it
is
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
remitted
the
arbitration
or
commented
the
arbitration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it?
is
it
too
long
to
read?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
subject
matter
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is,
the
arbitration
with
--
that
the
agreement
would
force
an
arbitration,
matters
which
are
strictly
a
function
of
management
help.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
needless
to
say
grievance,
a
difference
of
opinion
may
arise
as
to
what
are
matters
strictly
for
the
--
for
the
management.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
not
covered
by
any
other
provision
of
the
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
involved
is
a
conflict
of
view
unless
it's
ludicrous
--
what
it
involves
is
a
conflict
of
view
whether
there
are
provisions
in
the
agreement
that
has
been
--
that
limit
the
strict
view
or
confinement
because
it's
dealt
within
the
come
provisions
explicitly
or
implicitly
in
the
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
was
it
arbitrable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
--
i
should
think
of
large
percentages
of
the
controversies
for
which
there
is
a
procedure
to
peaceful
settlement,
arises
precisely
on
the
question
whether
or
not
it's
a
matter
of
exclusive
concern
to
the
management
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
suppose
those
are
almost
the
majority.
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
is
a
good
many
large
percentages
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
settle
for
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
be
good
--
will
you
be
good
enough
to
read
if
you
can
the
terms
in
which
the
grievance
was
formulated
which
was
asked
to
go
to
arbitration
in
this
case
and
then
read
the
terms
of
the
proposal
which
you
made
or
a
provision
in
the
contract
which
--
which
failed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wait
a
minute.
104?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
lockout
explicitly
prohibited
in
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
read
--
now
if
you
will
read
what
was
proposed
to
the
company
to
be
incorporated
in
the
agreement
and
rejected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
transcript
in
the
--
below?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
that's
here
and
you
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
down
--
the
stenographic
or
this
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
justice
brennan's
question
would
arise
more
--
more
concretely
if
the
grievance
to
which
you
call
our
attention
on
page
104
had
been
explicitly
opened
to
be
inserted
in
the
agreement
and
reject
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
i
don't
mean
that.
i
mean
if
instead
of
what
you
--
evidence
to
which
you
refer
that
there
was
a
general
desire
or
desire
for
a
general
clause
against
contracting
out
for
the
period
or
by
mutual
agreement.
you
said
that
that
is
different
from
what
is
claimed
here.
you
make
no
such
claim
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
make
a
claim
here
that
to
the
extent
that
they
exercise
this
contracting
out
in
this
case
is
a
way
of
violating
the
no
lock-out
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i'm
saying
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
some
other
--
any
from
--
you
referred
to
explicit
provision
and
say
this
is
a
way
of
defeating
those
explicit
provisions
and
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
don't
affect
with
their
lock
out.
now,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
is
i'm
saying
is,
suppose
there
had
been
an
explicit
--
the
question
that
my
brother
brennan
put
would
arise.
i'm
not
saying
what
its
relevance
but
it
would
arise
if
--
if
there
had
been
a
proposal
for
a
provision
exactly
in
those
terms.
the
company
shall
not
contract
out
with
a
view
to
--
thereby
indirectly
violating
any
provisions
of
this
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
my
question.
my
question
was,
well
if
that
wouldn't
concretely
raise
the
question,
here
you
say
that
the
proposal
doesn't
square
with
your
grievance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
that's
a
different
case
from
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
saying
the
antecedent
torts
of
proposal
in
a
collective
bargaining
negotiation
in
with
each
side,
is
making
proposals
for
this,
that
and
the
other
reasons.
but
for
so
reasons
for
the
assertion
of
power
reasons
that
satisfied
respective
constituents
etcetera,
etcetera,
though
they're
not
irrelevant
to
determining
what
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
agreement
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
isn't
before
us.
that's
for
the
arbitrators.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
it's
incompetent,
is
the
argument
you
have
to
make
before
the
arbitrator
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
not
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
know,
i
always
bristle
or
--
and
(inaudible)
when
people
talk
about
the
intent
of
the
parties
unless
they
mean
that
which
has
been
compounded
and
formulated
into
the
words
of
the
doctrine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
talk
about
intention
let's
loose
a
lot
of
hairs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
think
also
you
ought
to
have
been,
what
shall
i
say,
should
have
agreed
to
a
considerable
extent
to
adjust
the
import
of
justice
whittaker's
question
as
to
how
much
under
your
claim
is
necessarily
left
to
the
arbitrator
not
to
determine
his
jurisdiction,
that's
another
mischievous
word
in
this
connection,
but
how
much
of
the
wording
of
the
system
is
dependent
upon
the
arbitral
skilled
worker.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
judge
magruder
has
had
an
experience
as
he
--
on
those
which
is
not
on
private
knowledge
because
he
has
referred
to
it
in
an
article.
he
has
had
experience
in
which
this
court
has
overruled
him
on
what
he
thought
was
a
perfectly
untenable
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
a
fact
about
it?
and
--
but
he
said
it's
conceivable
that
this
court
could
have
been
right
and
he's
wrong
in
that
particular
situation.
and
he's
a
very
modest
man.
and
so
as
judge
magruder
in
effect
as
i
find
that
his
opinion
is
that
he
ruled
out
that
the
arbitrator
might
find
significance
with
an
agreement
that
he
has
not
discovered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
--
this
court
has
had
members
--
has
members
who
are
--
who
are
constantly
learning
that
things
they
didn't
see
seemed
to
be
as
clear
as
possible
to
a
majority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
size
of
the
personnel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
we
can
all
agree
on
that.
i
hope
we
can
all
agree
on
that
that
it
must
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lang,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
at
this
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
put
to
one
side
for
the
moment
the
case
that
you
have,
namely
where
you
place
reliance
on
what
were
preexisting
conditions
determining
or
--
or
indicating
what
management
rights
are
at
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
had
no
such
antecedent
arrangements,
antecedent
efforts
to
put
something
in
on
the
part
of
union,
resisted
by
the
management
and
now
--
and
in
drawing
the
inference
you
do.
and
the
question
comes
up
whether
the
claim
of
grievance
of
the
union
is
arbitrable,
if
you
resist
on
the
ground
that
it
was
strictly
a
management
right.
it
comes
before
the
court,
how
does
the
district
judge,
on
what
basis
in
a
situation
where
you
haven't
got
raw
materials
--
on
what
basis
will
he
decide
whether
it
is
within
or
without
strictly
management
rights?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
cover
the
universe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
reason
being
that
in
order
to
determine
what
i
might
call
a
threshold
jurisdictional
question,
he
would
have
to
decide
the
merits
of
what
is
or
what
is
not
strictly
management,
wouldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
its
--
my
question
was
that
if
you
had
that
naked
situation
and
if
he
did
not
allow
it
to
go
to
arbitration,
he
would
in
effect,
in
fact,
deciding
the
merits
of
what
is
a
management,
wouldn't
he?
what
are
management
rights?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
this
case.
all
i'm
saying
is--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
--
but
if
there
is
a
threshold
question
to
jurisdiction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
goes
to
you
that
much
of
used
terms?
and
you
say
that
where
there
isn't
a
specific
negotiation
history
fencing
in
what
is
and
what
is
not.
the
whole
thing
has
withdrawn
it
on
bona
fide
claim
that
is
made
where
you
can't
take
it
as
just
a
sham
for
the
usual
exception
to
everything
in
this
world.
you
say
in
order
not
to
let
it
go
to
arbitration,
he
would
in
fact
have
to
adjudicate
that
question,
wouldn't
he?
in
that
place
where
there's
no
negotiation
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
the
contract
in
all
its
details.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say,
mr.
lang,
to
mr.
feller's
contention
that
what
the
union
tried
to
get
into
the
argument
was
to
put
it
a
mildly,
a
much
broader
provision
than
they
claim
they
now
make
for
submission
to
arbitration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
brings
me
to
remarks
you
made
a
minute
ago
--
the
comments
made
a
minute
ago
about
the
sensitiveness
to
management
--
of
management
against
the
arbitration.
would
you
care
to
say
what
--
on
what
basis
of
experience,
i
don't
mean
the
general
attitude
to
which
i'm
--
i
think
not
wholly
unfamiliar,
but
what
in
the
basis
of
experience
with
arbitrators
such
those
had
been
named,
the
late
dean
shulman
or
mr.
david
cole
of
jersey,
what
--
on
the
basis
of
what
experience
do
they
feel
that
arbitration
is
the
kind
of
a
loaded
dice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
care
to
say
something
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
know
that
for
years,
he
tried
to
be
released
from
the
umpiring,
the
arbitration
under
the
arbitration
scheme,
has
been
fought
for
years.
and
ford
simply
wouldn't.
i
don't
mean
the
union
but
ford
wouldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
union
approached
this
but
--.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
happen
to
know
that
experience
in
detail.
justice
felix
frankfurter
litigants
don't
like
to
lose,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lang,
may
i
ask
this
question.
you
speak
of
your
reliance
is
on
what
you
call
the
objective
conduct
of
the
parties
prior
to
the
formulation
of
the
agreement,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case,
the
clause
in
controversy
or
the
claim
in
controversy
was
reduced
in
writing,
there
was
a
document
which
adds
for
the
inclusion
of
a
particular
clause,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
proposal,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
rejected.
am
i
right
in
assuming
that
you
wouldn't
draw
a
distinction
between
objective
conduct
evidence
by
a
piece
of
paper
and
objective
conduct
that
comes
out
to
the
mouth
of
witnesses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
might
not
--
might
not
the
proposal
be
made
by
the
chief
negotiator
for
the
union
by
way
of
mouth.
that
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
written
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
an
--
an
--
it
would
be
consonant
with
your
argument
that
evidence
by
witnesses
as
to
what
was
proposed
and
what
they
rejected
and
so
on,
without
any
documentary
proofs
would,
come
within
your
adoption,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what
he
--
what
he
said
in
effect
is,
the
course
of
the
negotiation,
legally
amounted
to
writing
in
to
the
contract,
rejection
of
your
claim
that
that
farming
out
stuff
gives
rise
to
grievance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
if
--
if
that
were
--
if
that
were
in
the
contract
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
contract
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
because
the
contract
says
that
farming
out,
or
what
do
you
call
this
--
contracting
out,
is
a
strictly
managerial
function.
then
you
couldn't
--
then
even
you
would
agree
that
you
couldn't
come
in
and
say,
“despite
that,
you're
wanting
to
--
to
go
to
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
you
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
it
said
specifically
that
there's
a
clause
now
saying
strictly
--
strict
functions
of
management
or
whatever
it
is.
and
then
it
says,
“this
is
a
strict
function
of
management”,
could
you
still
come
in
get
arbitration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
his
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
man
has
a
chance
to
going
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
before
you
sit
down?
why
did
you
--
why
did
you
--
did
you
not
ask
for
--
for
some
rejections?
why
did
you
go
to
trial?
why
did
you
just
file
your
complaint
and
next
the
agreement
and
the
rest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
to
you,
all
that
is
irrelevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
just
want
to
know
why
you
didn't
ask
summary
judgment,
nevertheless.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
your,
theory
you
could
stood
that
on
your
complaint
and
not
offer
any
evidence
until
mr.
lang
offered
his
memory
book,
is
that
right?
