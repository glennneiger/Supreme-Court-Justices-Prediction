do
you

(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
without
violating
this
contract?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
this
true,
mr.
feller,
that
this
district
judge
is
confronted
with
a
necessity
to
determine
what
is
arbitrable
or
whether
this
claim
is
arbitrable?
and
that
is
a
matter
if
intention
of
the
parties,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.

the
--
it
and
the
employer
bargained
about
including
in
the

no
work
would
be
contracted
out
but
that
this
covenant
was
rejected,
shed
light
upon
the
intention
of
the
parties
as
to
whether
they
intended
such
to
be
arbitrated?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
now
isn't
that
what
this
is?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
foreman's
own
jurisdiction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
that
means
i
take
it
in
your
view
that
every
dispute
is
arbitrable
under
this
contract.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
maybe
that
system
is
precisely
ones
for
views
in
connection
with
some
(inaudible)
bad
essence.
