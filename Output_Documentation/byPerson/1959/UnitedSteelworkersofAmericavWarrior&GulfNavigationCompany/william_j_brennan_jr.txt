justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
may
i
ask
mr.
feller.
i
gather
under
what
you
said
to
us
earlier,
namely
that
the
determination
whether
a
submission
is
an
arbitrable
submission,
is
something
that
the
court
under
301
may
inquire
into
and
decide.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
first
paragraph,
the
introductory
paragraph
was
properly
before
--
was
properly
before
the
district
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
with
the
interpretation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
it
true
that
the
position
that
in
this
instance
in
taking
the
testimony
that
what
you
did
in
considering
the
factors
that
he
did
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
judge
overstepped?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
did
this
history
of
the
contracting
out
clause,
was
that
relevant
to
an
interpretation
on
the
first
paragraph
of
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
it's
not
relevant
to
a
determination
whether
the
grievance
submitted
involves
strictly
a
function
of
any.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
suppose
however,
the
--
or
what
would
your
position
be
had
the
history
of
the
contracting
out
clause
been
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
that
the
parties
expressly
considered
strictly
a
function
of
management,
that
language
of
the
arbitration
clause
when
they
were
debating
the
contracting
out
clause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
relation
specifically
to
contracting
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
way
it
came
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
way,
as
i
understand
your
position
then,
the
evidence
dealing
with
contracting
out
was
submitted
and
relied
upon
here.
it
was
not
offered
for
that
limited
purpose
of
the
interpretation
in
the
arbitration
clause.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
let
me
see
if
i
get
--
if
i
get
your
position
correctly,
mr.
feller.
in
effect
what
you're
saying
is
this,
that
the
extent
of
which
under
301,
it
sought
to
have
arbitration
order.
the
extent
to
which
the
court
may
make
any
inquiry
is
to
determine
the
meaning
of
the
arbitration
clause
only.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
any
evidence
the
court
may
receive,
extrinsic
evidence
that
bears
upon
the
meaning
to
be
given
the
arbitration
clause
may
be
received.
but
necessarily,
it
has
to
be
evidence
which
the
parties,
evidence
of
what
the
parties
said
and
did
and
the
exchanges
they
may
have
made
and
so
forth
in
relation
to
that
clause
alone.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
here
when
get
into
the
evidence
dealing
with
contracting
out
practices,
they
--
that
was
not
evidence
which
bore
upon
what
the
parties
meant
when
they
wrote
this
arbitration
clause.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
in
the
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
subject
to
the
three
or
four
steps
as
to
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
up
to
arbitration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
feller,
i'm
sure
that
the
--
this
is
relevant
here
but
as
--
an
instance
to
the
clarity
in
expression
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
its
issues
which
conflict
with
any
federal
statute
in
its
applications
established
by
purposes

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
irrelevant
here.
i
just

it
was
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

it
was
the
lobster
shift.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
unit
here,
mr.

this
