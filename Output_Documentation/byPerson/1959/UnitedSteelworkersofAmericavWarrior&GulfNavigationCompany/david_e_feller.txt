mr.
david
e.
feller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
little
more
difficult
case
than
the
one
which
we
have
just
been
through,
a
little
more
difficult.
and
the
difficulty
is
two-fold.
one
is
in
the
nature
of
the
grievance.
now,
this
is
the
kind
of
grievance
which
--
that
seems
to
raise
hackles
among
management
people,
arbitrators,
creates
more
confusion
than
i
think
any
other
single
type
of
grievance.
and
also
the
--
there
is
some
language
in
the
arbitration
agreement
which
does
not
appear
in
the
usual
or
standard
form
of
arbitration.
we
think
that
for
the
same
reasons
which
we
set
forward
in
the
first
case,
the
american
manufacturing,
the
court
should
come
to
the
result
here.
but
it
will
take
us
a
little
more
time
i
think
to
dispose
of
these
difficulties.
now,
to
the
facts,
in
this
case,
there
was
a
contract,
again,
executed
in
1956.
the
company
is
the
warrior
&
gulf
navigation
company
which
operates
a
barge
line.
it's
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
united
states
steel.
it
has
a
terminal
at
chickasaw,
alabama.
the
unit
involved
and
this
is
important
as
it
bears
on
the
grievance,
the
nature
of
the
grievance,
was
not
a
production
unit
in
the
usual
manufacturing
established
but
a
maintenance
unit.
this
was
a
unit
and
the
contract
covered
people
whose
job
was
to
repair
these
barges
as
they
came
into
the
terminal
from
time
to
time.
in
1958,
the
union
filed
a
grievance
essentially
claiming
that
what
the
company
was
doing
was
having
its
repair
work
done
instead
of
at
its
own
terminal.
at
other
terminals
nearby,
contracting
out,
it's
the
word
it
used,
to
work
to
other
employers.
and
that
this
violated
the
agreement
constituted,
they
said
“a
partial
lockout,”
it
was
the
word
of
the
grievance,
because
there
were
people
who
were
laid
off
by
warrior
&
gulf
who
did
this
kind
of
work,
who
could
do
this
kind
of
work
and
who
had
in
fact
done
this
kind
of
work
until
the
company
selected
to
have
someone
else
do
the
work
instead
of
--
of
the
employees
of
the
collective
bargaining
unit.
the
employer
of
the
company
refused
to
arbitrate
the
grievance
and
a
lawsuit
was
filed
asking
that
the
grievance
be
arbitrated.
let
me
say
a
word
about
the
grievance
because
this
applies
to
both
cases
and
indeed
in
all
cases.
i
will
not
treat
the
grievance
the
actual
language
of
grievance
as
defining
the
scope
of
the
contract
claim.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
even
the
dissenting
judge
treated
it
that
way.
grievances
in
the
nature
as
being
appalled
by
a
workman
not
by
staff
representative
the
union
usually,
that
work.
they're
certainly
aren't
to
be
construed
with
the
strictness
which
under
the
federal
rules
even
the
complaints
drafted
by
lawyers
no
longer
are
treated.
and
there's
no
provision
for
amendment.
and
grievance
really
is
just
the
starting
paper
which
starts
it
off,
the
claims
are
defined
and
refined
as
the
grievance
procedure
goes
along.
in
any
case
they
filed
a
grievance
saying
that
the
company
had
violated
the
agreement
by
contracting
out
this
work.
the
company
refused
to
arbitrate
and
it
went
to
the
court.
in
it's
defense,
in
the
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
it's
a
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
all
right.
i
will
give
you
--
in
the
--
in
the
contract,
i
suppose
the
best
place
to
find
it
--
well,
on
page
12
of
our
combined
brief,
it
set
out
the
essential
part
it
set
out.
the
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i'll
read
it.
mr.
david
e.
feller
(voice
overlap)
it
--
it
kind
of
reads
backwards
and
i
--
i
will
invert
the
--
the
order
in
which
it
appears
and
we'll
start
at
the
beginning
in
attempt
--
point
of
time
and
it's
the
second
quoted
paragraph.
“should
differences
arise
between
the
company
and
the
union
or
its
members
employed
by
the
company
as
to
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
provisions
of
this
agreement,
or
should
any
local
trouble
of
any
kind
arise,
there
shall
be
no
suspension
of
work
on
account
of
such
differences
but
an
earnest
effort
shall
be
made
to
settle
such
differences
immediately
in
the
following
manner.”
and
then
you
go
through
the
grievance
procedure
with
the
ascending
steps,
all
arbitration
at
the
end.
but
before
all
that
is
the
following
introductory
paragraph
which
is
one
of
the
two
difficulties
in
the
case.
“issues
which
conflict
with
any
federal
statute
in
its
application
as
established
by
court
procedure
or
matters
which
are
strictly
a
function
of
management
shall
not
be
subject
to
arbitration
under
this
section.”
and
what
we
have
in
these
contract
is
a
larger
than
usual
grievance
and
arbitration
specification
which
covers
both
questions
of
meaning
and
application
and
any
local
trouble
of
any
kind
in
addition
plus
a
limitation
saying
in
the
words
which
i've
quoted
which
at
least
insofar
as
relevant
here,
appears,
at
least
in
our
view
and
all
i
anticipate
by
argument,
to
limit
the
arbitrator
to
questions
of
what
we
think
are
questions
of
meaning
and
application
of
the
agreement.
but
this
is
one
of
the
issues
in
the
case
as
the
proper
construction
of
that
language.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
there
are
--
obviously,
there
are
such
differences
and
the
question
is
under
this
language,
“who
resolves
those
differences?”
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
more
importantly
--
now
i
think
we
would
say,
and
again
i'm
anticipating
here,
that
i
might
as
well
get
this
clearly
out
as
really
the
essential
part
of
this
argument.
every
grievance
and
i
think
it
is
most
important
to
recognize,
every
grievance
claimed
against
action
which
is
taken
by
management
as
a
matter
of
a
function
of
management.
management
under
this
contract
as
a
management
rights
clause,
some
contracts
do,
some
contracts
don't,
it
doesn't
make
really
much
difference.
management
hires,
fires,
pays
the
people,
directs
the
working
force
and
schedules
the
workers.
that's
the
management's
function.
it's
not
only
its
rights,
its
--
its
obligation,
it's
its
duty.
a
management
obviously
has
the
right
lay
off
employees.
the
only
question
in
every
grievance
is
whether
a
management
which
should
always
be
active
in
exercising
its
function
of
directing
the
working
forces,
scheduling
the
employees,
paying
them
has
in
doing
that
violated
some
provision
expressed
or
implied
in
the
agreement.
if
it
lays
off
a
instead
of
b,
the
argument
which
a
grievant
--
a
says,
“i
shouldn't
have
been
laid
off,
b
should
have
been
laid
off.”
obviously,
management
is
exercising
its
function
of
managing
in
laying
off
a
man.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
picking
the
one
to
be
laid
off
in
first
place,
that's
management's
job.
it
makes
the
determination.
it
reads
the
contract.
it
determines
what
it's
going
to
do.
in
the
nature
of
the
grievance
procedure,
this
consultative
system
ending
up
in
arbitration
is
that
you
then
determine
whether
a
management
which
acted
the
first
place,
acted
in
accordance
with
the
other
provisions
of
the
agreement
in
exercising
management's
function.
now,
we
read
this
provision
which
says
that
you
don't
arbitrate
things
which
are
strictly
a
function
of
management
as
meaning
strictly,
i.e.
purely
a
function
of
management.
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
which
there
is
no
claim
that
there
is
anything
covered
in
the
other
provision
of
the
agreement.
it
comes
down
to
in
the
end
very
much
at
--
and
it's
necessary
because
you
have
a
broader
grievance
procedure
which
allows
grievances
on
any
local
trouble
whether
or
not
related
to
the
agreement
to
be
handled
in
the
grievance
procedure.
this
is
not
a
limited
grievance
procedure.
you
can
file
a
grievance
which
says,
“we
don't
think
the
company
ought
to
install
this
new
machinery.”
and
under
this
grievance
procedure
that
must
be
processed
if
there's
trouble
about
that.
we
don't
claim
that
you
don't
have
any
contract
right
to
do
it
but
we'll
just
then
will
think
you
ought
to.
or
we
think
that
joe
jones
is
the
foreman.
he's
a
mean
and
nasty
man.
we
think
the
company
ought
to
fire
joe
jones
as
the
foreman.
and
there's
problem
about
joe
jones.
under
this
agreement,
that
is
the
local
trouble
and
you
go
through
the
grievance
procedure.
this
is
the
finding
of
fact
in
the
united
states
steel
contract
which
i
gave
your
honor.
we
permit
that
up
to
a
certain
stage
of
the
grievance,
any
complaint.
we
defined
there
grievance
as
a
--
a
complaint
of
violation
in
the
agreement
but
complaints
are
much
broader
than
that.
now,
having
given
that
broader
scope
to
the
grievance
procedure,
covering
matters
which
relate
to
the
agreement,
right
of
claims
of
violation
in
the
agreement,
the
parties
had
to,
we
assume
in
the
hypothetical
intent
which
we
always
do
here
as
you
do
when
you
interpret
legislation,
find
out
what
they
meant
in
this
first
paragraph.
and
when
they
say
that
a
matter
which
strictly
a
function
of
management
is
a
matter
in
which
management
--
there's
no
claim
that
management's
rights
are
limited
by
the
agreement.
in
the
joe
jones
case,
i
don't
claim
that
management
has
got
a
--
employ
a
foreman
who's
pleasant
to
the
workers.
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
i
talked
about
in
the
previous
case.
there
are
lots
of
grievances
like
that
and
they
say,
“now,
those
matters
are
strictly
a
function
of
management.”
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
precisely
our
position
is
that
this
arbitration
provision
just
like
the
one
in
american
manufacturing,
though
differently
phrased,
intends
to
limit
the
arbitrator
to
the
determination
of
questions
of
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement,
whether
or
not
the
company
has
violated
the
agreement.
and
when
you
raise
a
question
like
that,
you
are
not
in
the
areas
which
are
strictly
a
function
of
management.
you
are
in
the
areas
in
which
there
is
dispute
as
to
whether
management's
rights
are
not
limited
--
whether
management
rights
are
limited.
now,
it
could
be
argued
abstractly
as
a
matter
of
language
that
when
you
say
with
this
kind
of
a
clause,
the
court
before
it
orders
arbitration
has
to
decide
whether
management's
rights
are
limited
or
are
not
limited
in
the
way
he
claimed.
the
court
needs
to
decide
that.
the
fellow
that
is
it
proves
too
much
because
then
every
grievance
must
be
decided
by
the
court.
because
then
every
grievance
involves
--
every
grievance
involves
a
management
function
and
a
claim
that
management
has
violated
some
rules
expressly
or
impliedly
contained
in
the
agreement
limiting
the
way
in
which
it
performs
its
functions
or
prescribing
a
particular
way
in
which
it
shall
perform
its
functions.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
what
--
that's
what
every
grievance
says.
a
--
a
question
of
whether
management's
right
in
this
area
or
to
do
what
he
did
management
always
does.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no.
those,
i
--
i
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
when
i
--
i
say
every
grievance
i
mean
grievance
and
i
should
--
i've
--
accustomed
to
speaking
in
u.s.
--
to
your
language.
i'm
talking
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
of
grievance
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
as
the
complaint
of
violation
of
the
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
it's
not
true
in
every
complaint
where
the
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
no.
that's
right.
it's
not
true
of
that.
and
the
purpose
of
this
paragraph,
we
believe,
was
to
inartistically
and
unfortunately
labor
agreements
are
often
drawn
inartistically
to
limit
the
effect
of
the
following
language,
the
prior
language.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
a
very
curious
thing
and
i'll
advert
to
it
right
here.
well,
i
plan
to
do
it
later.
there
is
a
case,
timken
roller
bearing
company
versus
n.l.r.b
in
the
sixth
circuit
involving
the
contracting
out
of
work
among
some
other
things.
it
was
decided
in
1947.
in
which
that
case
arose
in
this
fashion
and
this
is
how
arbitrability
can
be
decided
the
other
way
around.
the
company
contracted
out
some
work
and
the
union
called
a
strike.
while
the
strike
was
in
progress,
the
company
refused
to
meet
with
the
union
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
issued
unfair
labor
practice
charges
and
found
the
company
guilty
of
a
violation
of
the
duty
to
bargain.
and
the
question
came
up
to
the
sixth
circuit
on
the
question
of
enforcement
of
that
order.
and
the
court
held
that
the
question
of
contracting
out
was
arbitrable.
and
since
it
was
arbitrable,
the
companies
had
no
duty
to
bargain
on
that
question
with
the
union
because
it
had
channeled
the
bargaining
as
it
were
into
the
grievance
procedure.
there,
the
employer
was
arguing
the
contracting
out
was
arbitrable
but
the
peculiar
thing
is
that
that
contract
--
and
if
your
honor
will
look
at
page
12
in
the
sense
beginning,
“should
differences
arise
between
the
company
and
the
union.”
and
i
will
read
from
the
--
the
grievance
procedure
in
the
timken
roller
bearing
case
which
said,
“should
differences
arise
between
the
company
and
the
union”,
and
i'm
reading
from
161
f.2d
951,
“as
to
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
provisions
of
this
agreement
or
should
any
local
trouble
of
any
kind
arise
in
the
plant,
there
shall
be
no
suspension
of
work
on
account
of
such
differences
but
an
earnest
effort
shall
be
made
to
--
to
the
settle
such
differences
properly
in
the
matter
here
and
after
outlined.”
and
that
agreement
said
and
that's
the
broad
thing
that
covers
what
i
call
grievances
technically,
claims
of
that
and
complaints.
the
agreement
also
provided,
though
the
court
doesn't
quote
it,
“limited
arbitration
to
grievances
or
disputes
involving
the
interpretation
or
application
of
the
contract.”
and
that
contract
in
our
belief
is
substantially
the
same
as
this.
the
sixth
circuit
held
there
it
was
arbitrable,
not
in
the
claim
of
the
union
to
arbitrate
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
timpken
roller
bearing
company
v.
n.l.r.b,
161
f.2d
949
we
cited
it
in
our
brief
though.
mr.
david
e.
feller
because
it
involved,
i
said,
the
court
a
question
of
the
scope
of
management's
rights
as
compared
with
the
rights
of
the
employees.
that's
a
very
general
language
to
that.
and
this
is
something
which
was
committed
to
the
arbitration
procedure.
the
board
argued
it
was
not
arbitrable.
the
national
labor
relations
board
argument
was
not
arbitrable,
therefore,
the
company
had
a
duty
to
bargain
with
the
union.
mr.
david
e.
feller
mr.
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
they're
about
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
this
is
correct
that
a
large
percentage
of
grievances
involved
areas
in
which
management
says,
“well,
we're
not
restricted
by
the
contract
at
all.”
and
the
union
argues
that
there
is
an
obligation
implicit
in
the
agreement.
now,
this
is
that
kind
of
a
grievance.
there
is
nothing
in
language
in
this
agreement,
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
about
contracting
out
of
work.
nothing
which
expressly
limits
the
company's
right
to
do
it
or
in
fact
expressly
gives
the
company
the
right
to
do
it.
mr.
david
e.
feller
we
had
sought
and
i
want
to
get
to
that
and
that's
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
all
right.
i
will
--
i
will
do
it
right
here.
in
1956
negotiations,
before
this
contract
was
executed,
the
union
and
the
contracting
out
problem
has
been
a
problem
with
the
steel
workers
union
for
years,
sought
a
clause
which
would
have
forbidden
the
company
to
contract
out
any
work
unless
the
union
agreed.
they
sought
that
cause
and
united
states
steel
didn't
get
it
and
they
sought
it
here
and
didn't
get
it.
now,
the
fact
that
the
company's
--
the
union
sought
such
a
clause
was
relied
on
both
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
argue
that
the
grievance
here
was
not
arbitrable.
i
want
to
make
several
points
in
connection
with
that.
first
of
all,
i
think
unlike
contract
interpretation
where
proposals
which
parties
make
to
each
other
commercial
contracts
may
be
relevant
and
there's
no
damage
done
to
the
process
by
bringing
in
proposals.
actually,
many
arbitrators
will
refuse
to
hear
proposals
which
the
parties
have
made
with
others
for
a
very
good
reason.
if
parties
know
that
when
they
make
a
proposal
to
deal
explicitly
with
the
subject
which
they
think
or
may
have
an
argument
has
already
dealt
with
the
contract.
and
that
was
a
proposal
--
will
be
used
in
the
arbitration
process
thereafter.
you
place
a
large
rulebook
in
the
--
in
the
conduct
of
successful
collective
bargaining.
each
party
is
playing
it
very
close
to
the
bets,
it
can't
be
frank
and
say
what
it
wants
because
if
it
is
frank,
it's
going
to
get
cut
in
an
arbitration
proceeding.
for
that
reason,
most
arbitrators,
many
arbitrators
will
take
with
great
deal
of
reluctance
evidence
as
to
proposals.
as
a
matter
fact,
in
the
agreement,
for
the
first
time
in
the
agreement
just
concluded
in
the
basic
steel
industry
because
there
were
such
a
public
cure
about
the
local
working
conditions
issue,
the
work
rules
dispute
this,
specifically
provided
what
we
have
always
done
in
practice
that
neither
party
shall
make
any
reference
to
any
proposals
which
the
other
party
had
made
during
the
course
of
the
negotiations.
but
that's
an
arbitrator
not
a
court.
now,
if
we
assume
that
the
court
is
in
the
position
of
an
arbitrator,
an
assumption
which
i'm
willing
to
make.
but
if
you
assume
it
is
and
as
--
because
i
think
the
course
of
negotiations,
if
it
does
come
in
before
the
arbitrator,
bears
on
the
question
of
the
proper
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement.
you
would
construe
the
agreement
in
the
light
of
the
proposals
which
the
parties
had
made
to
each
other.
if
you
want
to
construe
it
in
those
terms
and
if
you
want
to
get
in
on
that
basis,
my
answer
to
the
district
court's
and
the
court
of
appeals'
reliance
on
the
1956
proposals
of
this
--
what
the
union
proposed
in
1956
was
a
bar
on
all
contracting
out
of
work.
in
this
grievance,
i
think
it
ought
to
be
made
perfectly
clear
in
this
case.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
contracting
out
of
work
is
not
a
management
function.
we
do
not
contend
that
management
does
not
have
the
right
to
contract
out
of
work.
as
soon
as
they
get
confused
with
absolutes,
we
say
management
has
a
right
to
contract
out
work.
mr.
david
e.
feller
without
violating
this
contract
so
long
as
it
uses
that
right
in
a
way
which
doesn't
violate
some
other
provision
in
the
agreement
just
as
it
has
the
right
to
lay
off
people.
of
course
it
has
the
right
to
lay
off
people
but
it
has
an
obligation
to
use
its
right
to
lay
off,
to
schedule,
to
assign
and
to
contract
out
work
in
a
way
--
has
an
obligation
to
do
it
or
not
to
do
it
in
a
way
which
impinges
on
some
other
obligations
which
it
has
assumed
in
the
contract.
there
are
some
very
good
arbitration
decisions
involving
just
this
question
and
of
course
people
get
in
their
absolutes.
the
company
says,
“the
union
is
trying
to
stop
us
from
contracting
out
all
work.”
the
union
says
--
i
know
in
one
--
are
contracting
out
case
in
basic
steel
has
said,
“what
if
they
can
contract
this
work
out,
they
contract
out
the
operation
of
a
blast
furnace.”
i
mean
let's
take
a
hypothetical
which
factually
used
in
the
steel
arbitration
case.
the
union
said,
well,
if
they
do
this,
you
what
they
can
do?
we've
got
a
contract
covering
the
open
heart
of
a
blast
furnace.
they
can
just
get
some
contractor
and
say,
“now,
you
come
in
and
operate
our
blast
furnace
for
us
and
do
it
for
us
for
a
price,”
and
the
contractor
come
in
a
wage
where
it's
half
of
those
of
the
people
who
had
been
working.
and
essentially,
what
they
have
done
is
destroyed
the
collective
bargaining
unit
and
actually
destroyed
the
contract
by
simply
hiring
somebody
to
come
in
and
supply
labor
at
lower
rates.
and
we
said,
“well,
therefore,
no
contracting
out
can
be
permitted
going
from
extreme
to
extreme.
the
company
said
on
the
other
hand
obviously,
sometimes
we
make
--
miss
materials,
sometimes
we
--
in
our
own
plant
sometimes
for
reasons
of
economies,
it's
desirable
as
first
to
buy
materials.
that's
contracting
out,
sometimes
we
have
certain
work
done
in
the
plant
for
reasons,
practical
business
reasons,
it's
important
for
us
for
having
done
off
the
plant.
therefore,
we
must
have
the
right
to
contract
out
in
all
circumstances.
well,
what
the
arbitrator
said
in
a
really
very
careful
decision
is,
and
let
me
use
the
words
of
ralph
seward
who
was
one
of
the
most
distinguished
labor
arbitrators.
“the
company
has
and
always
has
had
a
broad
general
right
to
contact
with
other
companies
for
the
furnishing
of
goods
and
services.”
this
is
quoted
on
page
64
of
our
brief.
“there
is
also
no
question
that
it
may
not
properly
abuse
that
right,
that
it
may
not
exercise
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
frustrate
the
basic
purposes
of
the
agreement
or
make
the
agreement
impossible
to
perform.”
the
implied
obligations
issued
as
it
posed
in
this
case,
is
not
whether
the
company
may
contract
all
of
its
work
or
none
of
its
work.
it
is
whether
there
was
any
implied
contractual
bar
to
the
contracting
out
of
this
particular
work
at
this
particular
plant
and
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case.
now,
when
you
claim
as
we
claimed
here
that
the
company
violated
the
agreement,
we
are
claiming
that
by
contracting
out
this
work
at
this
particular
plant
or
terminal
and
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
company
violated
its
implied
obligations
under
the
contract.
(voice

--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
the
grievance
is
found
on
page
104
of
the
record.
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes.
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
paragraph
3
of
the
court's
--
district
court's
findings.
“we
are
hereby
protesting
the
company's
actions
arbitrarily
and
unreasonably
contracting
out
work
to
other
concern
that
could
and
previously
has
been
performed
by
company
employees.
this
practice
becomes
unreasonable
and
unjust
and
be
discriminatory
in
lieu
of
the
fact,
but
i
say
these
are
not
drawn
by
lawyers
--
in
lieu
of
the
fact
--
i
think
it
means
in
light
of
it
of
the
fact
that
at
present,
there
are
a
number
of
employees
who
have
been
laid
off
for
about
one
and
one-half
years
or
more
for
alledgedly
lack
of
work.
confronted
with
these
facts,
we
charge
the
company
is
in
violation
of
the
contract
by
inducing
a
partial
lockout
of
a
number
the
employees
who
would
otherwise
be
working
were
it
not
for
this
unfair
practice.”
mr.
david
e.
feller
if
lockout
is
explicitly
prohibited
by
the
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that
unfortunately
does
not
appear
on
the
record,
your
honor
but
i
can
direct
your
honor's
attention
to
the
place
within
the
transcript
to
which
it's
referred
to
and
described.
mr.
david
e.
feller
of
--
of
the
transcript
to
the
hearing
in
the
district
court.
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes.
well,
i
will
on
page
83
of
the
record.
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
this
one.
mr.
david
e.
feller
the
hearing
before
the
district
court.
this
was
--
case,
i
never
got
around
to
saying
this
case
had
a
full
hearing.
mr.
david
e.
feller
the
company
in
its
defense
offered
really
defenses
which
went
to
the
merits
of
the
grievance
which
we
regard
this
whole
question
of
the
1956
negotiation
as
going
to
the
merits
of
the
grievance.
the
district
court
refused
to
strike
an
answer
so
we
have
to
go
and
put
our
case
here.
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
now,
the
witness
in
this
case
is
mr.
mcelroy
who
was
a
witness
for
the
--
for
the
employer,
mr.
lang
and
i
think
can
tell
you
who
is
--
what
his
function
is.
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
83,
the
answer
to
the
long
thick
paragraph
right
below
the
last
question.
“i
don't
recall
that
these
specific
words
were
read
or
said
at
the
negotiation.
i
do
recall
that
the
issue
of
contracting
out
work
was
brought
up.
i
don't
recall
that
it
had
anything
to
do
with
any
mutual
agreement.
i
think
that
the
request
was
that
the
company
quit
contracting
out
work
period.
then
if
you
turn
--
if
your
honor
will
turn
over
to
page
96
of
the
record,
and
here,
we
have
a
union
representative
testifying.
and
at
the
beginning
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
was
the
company
representative
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
in
the
negotiation,
and
this
is
now
a
union
representative.
and
in
answer
to
the
judge's
question
beginning
at
folio,
where
it's
marked
folio
141
about
one-third
down.
“let's
get
down
to
the
question
of
what
happened
in
this
instance.
well,
we
take
the
proposal
of
the
united
steel
workers
and
proposed
to
the
company
in
trying
to
protect
these
employees
that
we
try
to
limit
this
contracting
out
of
work
to
the
extent
that
we
mutually
again
agree
on
contracting
out.
was
that
the
general
proposal
made
by
the
united
steel
workers
to
the
united
states
steel
corporation
and
to
all
other
major
steel
companies?”
“yes,
sir.”
now,
this
is
all
there
is
from
the
record.
i
can
assure
you,
the
court,
because
i
participated
in
drafting
that
proposal
in
1956.
that
what
it
said
is,
“the
company
shall
not
contract
out
any
work
previously
performed
by
bargaining
unit
employees
except
by
mutual
agreement.”
there
was
flat
ban
on
contracting
out.
the
difference
in
the
testimony
here
is
the
company
said
it
was
a
flat
ban
and
the
union
said,
“well,
if
it
was
by
a
mutual
agreement,
you
could
contract
work
out.”
mr.
david
e.
feller
now,
the
testimony
follows
in
explanation
and
is
asked,
“did
we
agree
with
the
company
that
the
company
had
the
unrestricted
right
to
contract
out
work
in
those
negotiations?”
“never.”
“did
we
ever
claim
that
the
contract
restricted
the
company
from
contracting
out
emergency
repair
work?”
“no.”
the
contract
out
work
--
it
could
not
have
been
done.
actually,
the
proposal
on
1956
was
as
usual
proposal
made
for
bargaining
purposes,
was
far
beyond
anything
in
--
i've
so
many
reasonable
employer
would
undertake.
we
finally
settle
in
saying
we'll
have
to
live
with
the
kind
of
arrangement
we
have
under
which
under
the
arbitration
decisions
in
u.s.
steel,
and
this
just
was
a
carbon
copy,
the
arbitrators
have
held
as
i've
said
that
the
question
is,
the
company
has
the
right
to
contract
out
the
question
as
whether
it
exercises
that
right
in
a
way
which
involves
the
violation
of
some
other
provisions
of
the
agreement
abusing
its
right
to
contract
out.
now,
that
i've
already
dealt
with
the
number
one
difficulty
which
is
the
contracting
out
and
i
feel
that
i've
dealt
also
with
the
number
two
difficulty
that
is,
the
clause
in
this
contract.
let
me
say
what
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
did.
the
district
court
tried
the
grievance
as
i
said
and
it
found
that
on
this
contract,
it
interpreted
this
contract
as
giving
the
company
the
unrestricted
right
to
contract
out
work.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
e.
feller
we
--
we
believe
this
paragraph,
not
the
--
not
the
question
of
the
management
clause
as
to
contracting
out.
and
that
question
is
before
the
district
court
for
interpretation
as
we
view
it.
now,
i
will
say
that,
we
are
taking
a
much
more
modified
position
than
some
people
who
say
that.
since
you
commit
all
questions
of
interpretation
to
the
arbitrator,
he
should
also
be
given
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
the
right
to
construe
the
provisions
governing
arbitration.
we
take
the
position
that
as
i
think
we
must
in
all
candors
that
we
have
to
come
in
and
prove
there's
a
violation
of
a
promise.
and
in
order
for
a
court
to
determine
there's
a
violation
of
promise,
we
have
to
say
the
promise
was
to
arbitrate,
the
promise
has
not
been
complied
with.
mr.
david
e.
feller
we
are
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
oh,
he
--
he
went
into
the
question
of
contracting
out.
when
i
say
there's
a
question
for
the
court,
the
question
for
the
court
is
not
contracting
out
in
this
case
or
whether
mr.
sparks
was
able
to
work
in
the
american
manufacturing
case.
he
can
take
testimony
if
testimony
is
relevant
as
to
what
the
parties
meant
by
the
arbitration
clause.
that's
what
he's
interpreting
not
the
management's
rights
clause,
not
the
clause
having
to
do
with
seniority
or
discharges
or
any
other
clause.
he
is
construing
the
arbitration
provision.
this
distinction
we
were
not
able
to
persuade
the
district
court,
existed
because
he
said,
and
i
think
this
is
--
this
bears
directly
on
your
question,
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
pointed
out
to
him
that
should
any
local
trouble
of
any
kind
arise.
and
he
said,
and
he
saw
that.
he
says
i
don't
see
how
that
prevents
the
company
from
contracting
out
work.
well,
of
course,
it
doesn't
prevent
the
company
from
contracting
out
work.
but
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
we
do
not
think
so.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no.
the
--
as
we
read
that
clause,
that
determination
is
to
be
made
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
--
the
union
is
claiming
to
interfere
with
something
which
it
says
is
a
strictly
a
function
of
management,
the
joe
jones
case,
or
is
claiming
that
the
--
the
company
has
violated
some
other
provisions,
other
than
the
management
rights
clause.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that's
a
--
in
other
words,
if
the
evidence
were
introduced
as
evidence
going
to
the
proper
meaning
of
strictly
a
function
of
management.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that
you
might
argue
then
that
that
evidence
would
be
relevant
as
an
aid
in
the
construction
of
the
terms
“strictly
a
function
of
management.”
well,
of
course
this
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
clause
has
been
in
here
all
the
time.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
at
least,
it
was
not
made
the
findings
which
i'd
direct
your
honor's
attention
to
which
appear
at
particularly
on
page
105
on
the
record.
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
the
arbitration
clause,
we've
said
that
all
questions
of
contracting
out
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no
lock-out
provision
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
won't
--
i
don't
limit
myself
to
the
no
lock-out
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
would
say
that
that
agreement
was
not
admissible
that
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
that
this
would
not
be
admissible
and
irrelevant.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right,
your
honor.
that
would
be
admissible
evidence
subject
in
the
--
in
the
arbitration
proceeding.
mr.
david
e.
feller
oh,
this.
that
is
a
different
case
from
this.
but
even
in
that
case,
it's
none
of
the
district
court's
business
because
the
district
court
is
not
construing
the
management
rights
clause,
it's
construing
the
grievance
and
arbitration
clause.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i'd
go
further.
i
say
those
ought
not
to
be
irrelevant
in
determining
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
contract.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
for
the
arbitrators.
(voice
overlap)
and
a
fortiori,
they
are
not
irrelevant
even
if
they
were
good
evidence.
what
you've
argued
--
the
items
your
honor
mentioned
go
to
its
competency
really.
i
say
it's
incompetent
and
further,
i
say
here,
it's
irrelevant
because
you
have
to
decide
in
this
substance.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
here,
we
say
it's
irrelevant
because
nobody
has
asked
this
judge
to
find
what
he
did,
i.e.
the
contracting
out
as
an
inherent
right
of
management
which
the
union
cannot
claim,
is
limited
by
the
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
somewhat
hypothetically
but
still
a
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
your
honor.
they
intended
it
--
said,
shed
light
on
what
the
parties
intended
the
substantive
rule
should
be.
this
is
like
the
legislative
history
of
a
statute,
your
honor.
when
you
have
a
question
as
to
whether
a
federal
question
is
raised
in
a
case,
the
evidences
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
federal
statute
sought
to
be
construed
is
not
relevant
on
the
question
of
whether
there's
jurisdiction.
the
question
is
if
you
weigh
a
claim
and
you
say;
i
claim
a
right
under
this
statute.
now,
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
legislative
history
will
show
that
your
claim
is
very
bad,
that
the
proposed
right
that
you
think
the
statute
gives
you,
congress
fairly
considered
and
rejected
and
didn't
include
in
the
statute.
and
you
might
say
--
and
therefore,
really
on
the
merits
and
if
the
statute
is
going
to
be
construed
against
you
when
all
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute
is
relevant
there,
but
you
don't
make
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
there's
no
federal
question
before
the
court
on
the
basis
of
the
result
you
expect
the
court
to
come
out
to
on
the
substantive
question.
and
that's
precisely
the
question
--
the
kind
of
question
here.
if
you're
construing
an
--
paragraph
in
the
judicial
code,
if
could
find
out
where
the
court
has
contended
to
be
--
give
jurisdiction,
then
the
legislative
history
of
the
judicial
code
is
relevant.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
this
is
not
legislative
history
of
the
judicial
code,
this
is
legislative
history
on
the
substantive
issue
of
whether
management
should
contract
out
and
how
much
and
under
what
circumstances.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
--
that
is
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
--
the
distinction
we
want
to
make
is
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
they
have
just
concluded
another
collective
bargaining
agreement
down
here
which
the
subject
of
contracting
out
was
again
raised.
and
what
do
you
think?
the
company
proposed
that
the
contract
provide
the
company
shall
have
the
right
to
contract
out
work.
and
that
didn't
get
in
the
contract
either.
now,
the
arbitration
clause
means
the
same
thing
irrespective
of
that
evidence
as
to
what
they
proposed
in
1959
or
1960
negotiations
of
what
we
proposed
is
1956
negotiation.
that
evidence
we
can
argue
about
the
meaning
of
that
proposal.
when
we
get
before
the
arbitrator,
we
argue
the
extent
to
which
the
company
is
bound
or
is
not
bound
not
to
contract
out
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that
was
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
–-
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
should
think
not.
and
i
think
not
because
of
the
virtue.
i
think
that
is
the
intention
of
the
language
matters
which
are
strictly
a
function
of
management,
shall
not
be
subjected
to
arbitration.
i
think
that's
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
now.
that's
--
is
the
critical
point
in
the
case,
your
honor.
we
said
that
it
is
not
strictly
a
function
of
management.
the
only
way
you
construe
that
to
make
sense
is
that
the
court
has
to
look.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
says,
if
this
grievance
says,
“we
don't
like
joe
jones,
the
shift
foreman
and
there
is
no
claim
that
the
employment
of
joe
jones,
it
violates
any
obligation
under
the
contract,
then
that
case
is
one
which
involves
strictly
a
function
of
management
and
is
not
arbitrable.
mr.
david
e.
feller
now,
if
the
union
claims
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
up
to
arbitration.
mr.
david
e.
feller
but
if
the
union
claims
that
there
is
any
obligation
under
the
agreement
for
some
reason
not
to
have
joe
jones
as
the
foreman
or
not
the
contract
out,
then
that
claim
does
not
present
a
question
which
is
strictly
a
function
of
management
and
that
claim
can
go
to
the
arbitrator,
and
the
arbitrator
is
not
to
be
at
large.
he
is
to
decide
only
the
extent
to
which
management
rights
are
limited
in
this
circumstance.
that
is
the
only
way
which
i
think
this
clause
can
be
construed
without
making
every
grievance
a
subject
to
the
court
thing
and
i
think
it's
clearly
wasn't
intended
that
that
be
done.
no
more
than
i
think
that
it
was
intended
here
because
it
would
--
that
that's
an
unusual
kind
of
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
your
honor.
it
makes
the
--
the
arbitrator
the
final
authority
on
whatever
management
rights
are
restricted
with
respect
to
contracting
out
if
that's
the
issue
or
scheduling
of
work
or
anything
else
and
that
is
what
the
agreement
intends
him
to
be.
and
that's
the
only
thing,
he's
the
final
decision.
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
if
you
will
note
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
am
puzzled
over
that,
your
honor.
i
did
not
participate
in
these
negotiations.
i
don't
think
any
lawyer
did
for
the
union.
i
suggest
that
you
ask
mr.
lang
who
i
think
did
participate.
i
haven't
the
slightest
idea
what
that
means.
i've
been
prepared
to
make
that
guess
when
it
becomes
relevant
in
the
case.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
i
don't
think
anybody
relies
on
that
language.
it's
as
we've
said,
the
law
--
well,
it's
hardly
a
matter
of
--
of
draftsmanship
but
i
think
it
does
serve
to
illustrate
the
point
that
you
can't
read
these
things
as
if
they
were
corporate
trust
or
deeds.
these
things
are
--
are
collective
bargaining
instruments
and
you
have
to
look
to
the
institution,
the
nature
of
the
instrument
in
construing
this
to
give
effect
to
the
intent
of
the
parties.
and
i
think
that
the
--
this
construction
which
we
made
of
this
is
strictly
a
function
of
management
clause,
is
one
which
make
sense
in
terms
of
the
context
to
this
contract
and
the
only
one
that
make
sense.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
precisely
what
i
mean.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
and
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
oh,
i
--
i've
misunderstood
the
question
if
--
if
you
thought
i
must
answer.
i
have
no
doubt,
this
i
would
state
as
an
article
of
faith
on
the
question
of
the
whole
process
as
because
i
participated
in
the
process.
that
this
process
works
best
when
there
are
no
judges
around.
and
i
say
that
with
all
due
respect
to
the
--
to
the
courts.
it
is
important
and
essential
to
this
process
that
the
matters
which
the
parties
agree
should
be
left
to
arbitration
--
should
be
left
to
arbitration.
and
in
the
guise
of
deciding
the
arbitrator's
jurisdiction,
the
court
should
not
as
they
did
here
actually
decide
what
are
--
what
management's
rights
to
contract
out,
how
are
those
limited?
what
is
the
law
of
contracting
out
in
the
law
of
the
collective
bargaining?
the
incredible
thing
is
and
i
think
this
is
out.
there
is
a
very
good
decision
by
g.
allan
dash,
who
was
just
recently,
the
president
of
the
national
academy
of
arbitrators,
just
this
last
term.
he
wrote
a
decision
in
some
of
these
corporations
and
it's
cited
in
our
brief
which
reviews
every
reported
contracting
out
grievance
or
almost
everyone
at
least.
it's
--
it's
cited
on
our
briefs
at
pages
58
to
59.
and
he
reviewed
them,
i
think
as
an
arbitrator,
he
did
not
charge
the
parties
for
all
the
time
he
spent
in
research
on
that
decision,
at
least
i
hope
he
did.
but
he
analyzed
64
cases
classified
in
one
way
or
the
other.
most
of
them
held
no
violation
to
the
agreement
but
not
one
arbitrator
found
that
the
question
was
not
arbitrable,
though
in
10
cases,
it
was
argued.
they
found
the
questions
are
arbitrable
and
they
decided
against
the
grievance.
and
i
think
that
it's
easy
to
say,
“well,
arbitrators
always
want
business.”
but
i
don't
think
that
in
connection
with
people
like
dash
and
--
and
garrett
and
seward
and
the
people
who've
decided
this
cases.
their
problem
isn't
that
they
want
business,
they
have
too
much
business.
there
--
it
is
completely
far,
the
nature
of
the
grievance
procedure
of
this
administrative
machinery,
that
the
courts
in
the
lieu
of
--
in
--
in
lieu,
i'm
using
the
language
of
the
grievance.
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
the
guise
of
deciding
questions
of
arbitrability,
consider
evidence
and
decide
the
questions
on
the
merits.
and
let
me
add
one
word
that
is
important.
this
kind
of
question
of
which
--
incidentally,
the
first
circuit
of
judge
magruder,
i
think
has
gone
off
base.
judge
magruder
says
that
you
have
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
--
it
would
go
along
with
the
--
all
the
way
except
he
says
it
is
up
to
the
court
to
determine
whether
there
is
any
provision,
substantive
provision
in
the
contract
which
deals
with
this
matter.
and
professor
cox
in
his
recent
article
of
harvard
law
review
says
that
he
agrees
with
their
view
of
it
except
judge
magruder
always
comes
to
the
wrong
result
in
every
case.
i
think
that
when
you
understand,
and
this
is
a
distinction
which
judge
magruder
has
not
made,
which
professor
cox
has
not
made.
when
you
have
a
contract
with
an
absolute
no-strike
clause,
an
absolute
no-strike
clause,
then
it
is
not
fair
to
say
there
is
an
area
which
is
governed
by
the
contract
and
there
is
an
area
which
is
ungoverned
by
the
contract.
and
when
you
say
questions
of
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement,
the
court
has
to
determine
whether
this
is
an
area
governed
by
the
contract
or
ungoverned
by
the
contract
because
it's
possible
to
do
that
in
a
limited
arbitration
clause
which
incidentally,
most
of
judge
magruder's
cases
were.
well,
he
doesn't
advert
to
the
fact
if
you
read
it
very
carefully,
if
a
grievance
was
not
arbitrable,
it
was
strikable.
mr.
david
e.
feller
strikable.
in
other
words,
if
in
one
case,
the
question
whether
there's
seniority
clause,
they
transfer
a
man
to
the
night
shift.
he
says
under
the
seniority
clause,
i'm
entitled
to
stand
to
day
shift.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that
was
the
boston
herald
traveler.
that
was
the
--
the
lobster
shift.
i
don't
know
what's
the
lobster
shift
is
[laughs]
but
the
local
201
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
(voice
overlap)
case,
it
was
the
night
shift.
he
says,
“i
have
to
construe
this
contract
to
see
if
there
is
any
provision
governing
the
transfer
of
shift,
i.e.
whether
the
seniority
clause
governs.”
our
view
--
and
that's
a
question
for
the
arbitrator,
of
that
itself
is
a
question
of
interpretation
and
application.
but
his
cases
are
easy
for
him
because
if
he
says,
“no,
nothing
in
this
contract
governs
changes
in
shift,”
then
the
union
say,
“well,
very
well,
we'll
strike
you
on
this,
that's
reserved
to
you
and
we
reserve
our
rights
too,
we
strike.”
a
very
different
case
as
in
this
case.
well,
the
contract
says
there's
--
it's
an
absolute
no-strike
clause,
not
limited
to
an
arbitrable
grievance.
now,
when
you
hold
the
grievance
isn't
arbitrable,
you
don't
say
it's
not
governed
by
this
contract.
it's
governed
by
this
contract
alright.
it's
governed
by
this
contract
because
this
contract,
you
then
read
as
giving
management
the
right
to
do
what
it
does
without
later
hindrance
by
the
--
the
union
without
the
right
to
strike,
without
the
right
to
complain,
without
the
right
to
be
consulted.
all
of
rights
it
would
have,
absent
this
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
your
honor.
again,
every
dispute
which
makes
a
claim
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
that
it
is
--
that
there
is
a
question
arising
under
the
agreement.
there
are
disputes
when
you
say,
“look,
the
wages
in
here,
only
3$
an
hour
and
none
of
the
$3.50,
and
i
file
a
complaint.
that's
not
arbitrable
because
i'm
not
claiming
under
the
agreement.
i'm
claiming
something
in
fairness,
injustice,
and
equity.”
and
i
will
say
that
in
that
sense,
the
--
the
employers
come
in
agreement
that
says
$3
and
that's
it.
if
i
claim
that
under
the
agreement
we
have
under
this
thing,
its
express
terms
and
its
implicit
terms
and
there's
much
that
has
to
be
implied
in
this
kind
of
--
much,
much
that
has
to
be
implied.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
he's
got
a
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
he's
got
a
non-arbitrable
grievance.
mr.
david
e.
feller
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
e.
feller
he's
got
an
arbitrable
grievance
if
he's
going
to
lose.
now,
the
arbitrator
can't
say,
“well,
really
the
contract
says
$3
and
it
means
$3
but
you
want
to
have
$3.5.
i
think
he'd
be
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
exceeding
his
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
--
that's
my
--
my
--
reporting
out
pay
case
since
morning
where
the
contract
said
he
gets
four
hours
and
he
says
“well,
i
think
four
means
six.”
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
--
and
judge
magruder
would
agree
on
that.
the
first
circuit
would
agree.
he
says
once
in
a
--
out
of
vacation
case,
the
new
bedford
defense
products
case
which
i
think
the
question
was,
the
contract
says
you
have
to
be
on
the
payroll
in
june
to
be
at
vacation.
this
goes
that
i
was
in
the
contact
in
march.
and
he
said
that
was
arbitrable
because
he
could
find
whether
there
was
a
contract,
a
time
specified
in
the
contract,
therefore,
the
contract
governed
it
and
it
wasn't
his
concern,
not
whether
the
grievance
was
a
good
one
or
not.
mr.
david
e.
feller
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
comments,
when
you
refer
to
the
publication
are
not
in
--
in
a
periodic
one.
they're
in
the
decisions
on
arbitrability
from
which
he
expresses
his
own
view
in
reversing
judge
wyzanski
on
the
arbitrability
question.
it
was
inconceivable
to
him
that
this
court
could
have
sustained
judge
wyzanski's
position
on
whether
you
could
bring
suit
under
301.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
will
take,
the
court's
permission
only
a
minute.
now,
there
is
a
case
which
i
wanted
to
--
when
you
directed
the
citations,
i
i
would
like
you
and
your
honors
as
an
illustration
of
the
reverse
twist
on
this
matter
which
i
referred
to
in
the
timken
roller
bearing
case.
this
case
is
structural
steel
association,
the
shopmen's
local
union,
as
a
district
court
case.
mr.
david
e.
feller
it's
not
are
in
our
brief,
your
honor
its
in
172
f.
supp.
354.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
employer
contended
that
the
grievance
was
arbitrable
and
the
union
contended
it
was
not,
because
what
happened
there
was,
the
union
said
you
have
to
put
a
help
around
and
the
employer
said
we
don't,
and
the
union
struck.
and
the
question
was
whether
the
grievance
was
arbitrable.
the
courts
always
find
grievances
arbitrable,
i
should
say,
those
kinds
of
situations
and
i
think
all
really,
we
want
as
the
same
rule
when
it
goes
both
ways.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
it's
not
explicit,
but
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
decision
came
about
and
this
is
not
uncommon.
i
do
want
to
comment
on
mr.
lang's
taken
about
the
wide-open
clause,
to
have
done
and
our
contracts
with
the
in
the
aluminum
company
has.
any
grievance
which
is
not
arbitrable
is
strikable.
mr.
david
e.
feller
strikable.
where
you
have
that,
i'm
quite
sure
that
mr.
lang
is
quite
candid,
saying
that
if
he
wins
this
that
it's
not
arbitrable,
then
he
wins
it
all
the
way.
well,
this
contact,
you
can't
argue
that
because
the
whole
grievance
procedure
says
that
should
these
things
arise,
there
shall
be
no
work
stoppage,
but
the
following
procedure
shall
be
used.
now,
he
would
like
to
have,
and
of
course,
he
has
also
a
independent
no-strike
clause.
he
wants
to
have
it.
the
no-strike
clause
applies
but
it's
not
arbitrable.
well,
in
other
words
the
court,
and
he
said
he
was
going
distinguish
the
merits
from
the
merits,
i
don't
think
he
was
able
to
distinguish
the
merits
from
the
merits
because
what
he
regards
as
the
merits
of
arbitrability
is
the
merits
of
the
question
of
there
is
any
contractual
limitation
on
the
employer's
action,
and
that's
merits
of
the
grievance.
i
don't
understand
the
difference.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that's
--
it
goes
to
the
merits,
gives
rise
to
a
grievance.
well
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
if
the
contract
said
that
there
is
no
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
grievance
shall
be
processed.
mr.
david
e.
feller
oh,
yes,
sir.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
david
e.
feller
we
would
come
in
--
on
that
case,
we
would
--
that
would
be
a
very
telling
contractual
provision
on
the
merits
of
whether
there
was
a
limitation
on
the
management
function.
mr.
david
e.
feller
is
this
on
the
arbitration
clause,
(voice
overlap)
the
famous
machinery
clause?
oh,
there.
if
it
says
no
grievance
shall
be
processed
under
this
agreement
which
alleges
contracting
out,
which
is,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
make
that
history
here.
mr.
david
e.
feller
we
--
i
know
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
or
dealing
--
it's
not
very
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
that
there'll
be
no
question,
but
--
on
--
on
the
record
here
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
oh,
oh,
they
have
clear
this,
is
not
to
be
arbitrable.
mr.
david
e.
feller
because
it
says
it
isn't
arbitrable.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
then
--
but
that
is
not
what
--
that's
his
argument
here.
it's
not
--
was
not
his
argument
below.
it
was
not
the
findings
of
the
court
below.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
so,
your
honor.
we've
thrown
according
to
mr.
lang's
in
--
in
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
my
argument
here.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
claim
--
i'll
admit
to
having
grown
or
confessed
to
having
grown
but
we
have
never
contended
in
this
court,
in
our
original
brief
or
in
our
reply
brief
that
the
arbitrator
in
this
kind
of
cases
has
jurisdiction
to
interpret
the
arbitration
clause.
we
said
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
for
such
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
it's
more
explicit.
we
thought
it
was
implicit
in
our
original
brief.
i
would
want
to
comment,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
for
one
minute.
mr.
david
e.
feller
on
this
--
mr.
lang
said
that
the
wide-open
clause,
so-called,
as
the
common
--
as
a
common
clause
industry.i
have
no
--
practically
no
agreement.
i've
been
told
that
the
western
union
agreement
with
the
commercial
telegraphers
union
is
probably
on
the
agreement
but
then
large
units,
which
has
what
he
what
he
calls,
the
wide-open
clause.
the
clause
which
everybody
has
in
american
industry
is
the
clause
in
american
manufactures,
which
we
think
this
clause
is
the
same.
the
so-called
wide-open
clause
in
which
you
can
arbitrate
anything,
whether
it
relates
to
the
contract
or
not
is
the
most
atypical
clause.
and
let
me
--
again,
to
show
the
court
that
at
least
as
far
i
know,
management's
attitude
toward
arbitration,
some
of
the
justices
asked
that
of
mr.
lang.
in
the
big
industries,
in
a
responsible
place
where
there
is
responsible
labor
relations
history
and
a
blown-off
arbitration
practice,
what
is
shocking
both
to
management
and
to
the
union
eyes,
is
the
notion
that
arbitrators
don't
decide
this
kind
of
question
without
--
without
doubt,
because
they
decide
them
all
the
time,
and
without
argument.
this
kind
of
case,
a
contract
new
york
case,
we've
--
said
mr.
(inaudible)
decisions
by
mr.
(inaudible)
on
the
merits
of
--
of
contracting
out.
there
are
decisions
by
mr.
garrett,
mr
seward,
and
david
cole,
there
are
decisions
by
all
of
them,
but
they
--
none
of
them
would
dream
of
saying
that
under
a
clause,
other
than
one
which
specifically
exempted
that
kind
of
thing,
a
contracting
out
grievance
was
not
arbitrable.
mr.
david
e.
feller
we
did,
but
the
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
if
your
honor
please,
when
i
started
my
argument,
i
said
the
answer,
if
you
remember?
the
answer
has
set
up
all
these
practices,
and
as
all
these
notions
which
went
to
the
merits
of
the
grievance.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
and
so
we
moved
to
strike
that.
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
the
district
court
overruled
our
motion
to
strike.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
we
moved
for
preliminary
injunction
which
was
the
same
thing.
but
we
were
at
a
hearing
on
their
motion
to
dismiss,
and
our
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
the
judge
said,
“let's
hear
it
all.”
we
said,
“okay,
let's
strike
that
--
that
defense.”
because
that
goes
to
the
merits.
i
believe
that
was
argued.
i
--
didn't
participate.
and
that
was
argued
to
the
court.
and
we
said,
“this
is
not
relevant
here.”
and
the
court
says,
“it
is
relevant.
now,
i
overrule
motion
to
strike.”
well,
under
those
circumstances,
counsel
said,
“that
being
so,
we
introduce
this
evidence
under
protest
and
the
transcript
is
clear.
every
time
counsel,
mr.
lang
said,
“you
get
to
the
merits”,
mr.
black
who
tried
the
case,
said,
well,
that,
your
--
your
honor
has
overruled
my
motion
to
strike
and
i
feel
i'm
compelled
to
go
through
to
protect
myself
to
introduce
this
evidence.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
so.
