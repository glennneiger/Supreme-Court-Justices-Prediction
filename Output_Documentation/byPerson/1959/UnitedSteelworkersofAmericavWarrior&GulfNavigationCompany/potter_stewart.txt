well,
that's

that's
true
of
every
grievance
as
to
the
application
of
the
contract.
it's
not
purely
the
kind
of
grievance
that

of

you've
bee
talking
about

it's

mr.
feller,
you
told
us
that
--
that
what
is
crucial
as
the
meaning
of
the
arbitration
clause.
justice

and
if
this
is
a
matter
under
which
the
district
court
can
and
must
rightfully
go.
i'm
--
perhaps
you've
explained
it
but
it's
not
clear
to
me
what
--
what
the
--
what
this
arbitration
clause
means
in
this
case.
and
i'm
thinking
now
of
the
case
of

of
the
local
trouble
of
any
kind.
the

that's
something
clearly
not
covered

has
an
unpleasant
personality.
now
--
justice

is
that
arbitrable
or
not?

would
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
in
your
wage
case
that
if
--
if
an
employee
says
“this
$3
really
means
$3.50,”
and
that
would
be

-
arbitrable?
justice

that
is

that

would
be
arbitrable
if

i'm
not
talking
about

and
the
court
therefore
would
be
without
power
to
the
decline
to
specifically
enforce
an
arbitration.
justice

or
that
not
that
it's
inconceivable.
justice

is
it
in
your
brief?
justice

what
kind
of
a
no-strike
clause
was
there,
if
any?
