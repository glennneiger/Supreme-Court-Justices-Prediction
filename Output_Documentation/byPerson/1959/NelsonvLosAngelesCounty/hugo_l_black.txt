what
difference
does

that
they
did.

are
you
then
--

black
well,
did
the

find
it?
justice

l.
black
was
there
any
ground
on
which
he
refused

answer
except
for
the
fifth

justice

black
well,
now,
you
make
--
you
state
that
in
a
way
it
causes
distinction
without
any
supposed
(inaudible)
i
thought
you
said
that
the
only
thing
they
--
the
questions
they
asked
him
and
he
refused
to
answer
was
based
on

due
process,
what
do
you
press?
justice

l.
black
what
you're
talking
about?
fourteenth
amendment
or
federal
immunity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice

black
(voice

stated,
i
am
not
expert
about

justice

black
definite
--
definite
way
in
which
you
have
to
raise
the
constitutional

justice
hugo
l.
black
--
ground
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

objection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
was
your
objection
in
court
order?
justice

l.
black
(voice

--
justice

l.
black
do
you
have
--
do
you
have
other
(inaudible)
in
the
first
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
want
to
know
what
you
raise
because
i'm
interested
in
your
point
that
whether
or
not
if
this
is
solely
a
discharge
(inaudible)
the
constitutional
privilege.
i
want
to
know
if
i'm
barred
from
considering
it
by
your
failure
to
object
on
the
right
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
far
as
i'm
concern,
the
constitution
doesn't
say
anything
about
arbitrary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
you
have
--
one
of
your
grounds
for
objection
is
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment
in
that
it
bridges
its
right
to
be
free
from
being
a
witness
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
one
of
your
grounds.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
abandoning
this
ground?
the
discharge
violates
the
rights
of
the
petitioner
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
that
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment
in
that
it
abridges
his
right
to
be
free
from
being
witness
against
each
other?
are
you
abandoning
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
he
discharged
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
getting
away
--
getting
away
from
the
definition
of
it,
the
legal
definition,
what
would
he
be
discharged
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
he
had
claimed
the
privilege
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
other
reason
that
the
order
shows
on
which
his
discharge
was
based?
justice
hugo
l.
black
none
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
--
what
was
his
occupation?
what's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
position
was
he
occupied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
medical
social
worker.
justice
hugo
l.
black
evidently
a
very
sensitive
position.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
then
for
quiet
feeling
to
answer
questions
before
the
committee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

the
committee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

insubordination
to
the
federal
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
sole
basis
are
that
--
is
when
he
is
called
upon
the
congressional
committee
he
said,
“i
claimed
the
benefit
of
constitutional
privilege
not
to
testify.”
the
california
then
discharged
him
by
having
claimed
his
privilege.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
for
not
having
answered.
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
fail
to
answer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
fail
to
answer
the
other
questions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
discharged
for
failing
to
answer
any
other
questions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
congressional
committee
questions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
possible
in
it
for
you
to
make
it
involve
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
that
is
--
if
he
has
been
discharged
on
that
ground,
your
order
would've
said
so,
wouldn't
it?
your
order
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
speaks
the
true
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
had
been
discharged
for
failing
to
give
a
testimony
in
anyway
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
before
the
civil
service
board,
what
was
he
discharged
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
able
to
see
from
this
record
as
a
representative
of
california
or
the
city
of
whatever
it
is
that
he
was
discharged
for
failing
to
give
any
information
under
any
circumstances
to
your
civil
service
board.
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
voluntarily
or
involuntarily.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
he
refuse?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
that
the
reason
they
discharge
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
not,
certainly
not,
the
board
shows
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
must
--
must
we
in
order
to
find
this
man
right
for
the
discharge,
find
the
ground
[laughter]
that
your
order
didn't
rely.
are
you
defending
it
on
any
ground
except
that
he
failed
to
testify
before
the
congressional
committee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
only
reason
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
california
depends
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice

presume
that
might
