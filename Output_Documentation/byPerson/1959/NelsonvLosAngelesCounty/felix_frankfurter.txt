excuse
me
--
forgive
me
for
interrupting
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
started
up
by
saying
--
by
dealing
it's
relevant
to
give
the
--
what
you
call
in
capsule
from
the
situation
of
the
fact
--
the
fact
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
now
arguing
as
though
we
had
nothing
before
us
except
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
enlightened
me.
but
i
would
get
more
--
i
would
get
--
i
could
easily
--
more
easily
in
my
mind
apply
the
statute
before
i
knew
the
fact
for
having
the
abstract
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
the
lawyer
not
i.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
say
you're
the
lawyer
who
is
arguing
this
case
and
not
i.
so
go
ahead
your
own
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
do
i
gather
from
what
you
said
that
if
california
had
to
declare
your
judgment
procedures,
i
assume
it
has
under
which
you
could
have
gone
before
the
california
court,
assuming
you're
outstanding
there,
to
get
declaration
is
for
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
they
had
to
stay
there,
if
i
understand
you,
you
would
not
be
coming
here
finding
any
difficulty
which
the
stating
the
statute
in
abstract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
take
judicial
notice
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
it
was
adjudicated
that
although
the
truthful
statement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
mere
fact
that
a
man
and
a
questionnaire
doesn't
need
for
the
answers
of
the
suit,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
precludes
the
county
from
reexamining
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
--
i'd
like
to
echo
some
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
relevance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
there
--
is
that
the
record
solely
pure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
justice
whittaker
put
a
question
to
you
to
which
you
say
give
some
label.
and
to
which
you
said
he
was
more
accurately
in
stating
what
the
record
discloses
than
you
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
the
sequence
of
events.
he
--
he
was
asked
questions,
he
was
put
through
this
so-called
loyalty
procedure
(inaudible)
and
he
made
discloses
to
satisfy
the
inquiring
officer
at
the
time
subsequent
even
before
--
before
a
congressional
committee.
he
refused
to
answer
questions.
thereupon,
the
county
took
another
look
at
his
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
but
it
said
a
new
situation
was
created
by
his
refusal
to
answer
questions.
and
then
it
put
him
to
explaining
or
justifying
that
before
the
civil
service
commission.
is
that
an
accurate
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
read
correctly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
the
implication
of
that
answer
of
yours
wherein
he
--that
the
county
--
that
was
res
judicata
and
they
could
make
further
inquiries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
couldn't
make
further
inquiries,
to
your
phrase,
the
--
the
challenge
could
be
taken
up
by
him
to
explain
why,
although
he
made
full
disclosure
according
to
his
--
your
view,
would
satisfy
the
inquiring
of
parties
when
he
came
down
here,
he
--
he
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
those
--
are
those
the
facts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
difference
between
you
and
me
your
correction
is
merely
saying
the
county
should
have
done
something
which,
all
i
know,
i
might
agree
with
you,
would
be
a
more
rational
method.
what
the
county
did
do
to
--
to
act
without
serving
inquiry
upon
the
stated
answer
before
the
congressional
committee
and
then
put
him
to
an
explanation
for
doing
so,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
made
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
will
put
to
you
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
claim
then
is
that
that
res
judicata
and
the
county
couldn't
go
about
it
in
the
frank
movement,
namely,
you
go
before
the
civil
service
commission
and
satisfied
them
that
you
have
good
reason
for
withholding
answers
before
the
congressional
committee.
isn't
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
using
the
word
but
you're
claiming
it
in
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
summarily
discharged.
that's
my
point.
he
was
not
summarily
discharged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

in
the
first
instance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
was
not
summarily
discharged
without
having
been
given
the
opportunity
to
explain
why
he
didn't
answer
before
the
house
committee
what
you're
saying
he
so
abundantly
answered
to
the
lady
who
inquired
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
wirin.
you
make
no
distinction
between
nelson
and
globe,
do
you
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
briefs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
--
where
is
the
distinction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

status
of
the
distinction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
--
did
the
court
address
itself
to
the
problem
and
say
there
are
no
distinction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
point
taken
into
consideration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
court
address
itself
to
the
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
merely
take
out
that
fact
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
--
that
is
all
there
is
to
this
case.
that
seems
to
be.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
--
can
a
person
like
this
employed
by
the
county
to
discharge
except
on
some
statutory
authority
for
discharge?
it
must
--
in
other
words
whoever
is
the
functionary
of
--
purview
of
discharge
must
he
have
some
statutory
authorization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
source
of
authority
for
discharge?
is
it
a
statute
or
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
civil
service
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
--
if
a
person
who
has
tenure
as
well
as
protected
by
the
civil
service
law
of
your
state,
if
he's
fired
for
a
reason
not
sanctioned
by
the
civil
service
law
of
the
state,
could
he
bring
a
proceeding
for
illegal
discharge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
don't
like
the
cut
of
your
hair.
i
don't
like
the
crewcut.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
date
for
justification
must
be
in
the
rules
or
legislation.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
you
must
go
back
to
some
california
law
to
justify
the
charge,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
my
law,
i
mean,
civil
service
rule
that
had
defined
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
he
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
--
he
wouldn't
give
the
--
he
wouldn't
give
the
authorization
of
such
rule
so
and
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
does
the
man
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
know
when
he
fired
within
the
authority
of
the
rule
or
he
is
fired
capriciously?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
object
to
the
word
arbitrarily
so
i'll
use
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
when,
what's
the
name,
nelson
was
fired,
was
there
any
authorization
covering
his
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
and
that's
the
reason
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--why
he
was
fired?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
to
an
answer
to
justice
black's
question,
he
was
fired
because
he
didn't
answer
congressman
miller
or
some
congressman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
correct
only
if
that
comes
within
the
provision
of
failure
to
answer
insubordination.
you
said
--
two
minutes
ago,
you
said
he
can
be
fired
for
insubordination
in
not
answering
questions,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that's
your
justification,
then
he
was
quiet
for
not
answering
questions
which
constitute
insubordination
under
california
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
--
that
is
all
as
the
california
law
which
says
that
isn't
subordination,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
ask
you
a
few
questions
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
be
accurate
about
these
things.
when
he
was
before
the
civil
service
commission,
if
the
mass
case
is
the
ruling
law
of
california,
as
i
suppose
it
is,
would
he
have
been
allowed
to
explain
the
commission
why
he
refused
to
answer
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
he
give
explanation
and
certified
answer
to
these
questions,
these
and
these
and
these
unfair
consequences
would
follow.
could
he
have
done
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
he
explain
that
in
detail
if
he
choses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can
give
them
any
relevant
reasons
for
not
answering
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
which
that
court
would
have
had
to
respect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
was
given
an
opportunity,
was
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
refused
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
didn't
it?
and
he
refused,
didn't
it?

frankfurter

justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
part
of
the
record
(inaudible)
read?
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
we
--
must
we
give
him
aid
of
the
record
and
that
--
read
the
whole
of
it
and
get
the
order
of
a
commission
in
the
same
way
which
you
get
the
meaning
of
a
judgment
in
the
light
of
the
record.
