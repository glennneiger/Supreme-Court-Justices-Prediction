mr.
fred
okrand
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
first
with
reference
to
the
globe
discharge
which
was
the
discharge
that
mr.
lamoreaux
concluded
on.
our
position
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
mr.
globe
was
a
temporary
employee,
it
doesn't
dispose
of
this
case.
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
if
he
could
be
discharged
for
any
reason
because
he
was
temporary
employees
and
mr.
lamoreaux
answered
yes.
we
suggest
that
the
constitution
doesn't
go
that
far.
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
record
that
he
was
discharged
for
refusal
to
answer
before
the
house
committee,
no
dispute
at
all.
mr.
fred
okrand
now
--
mr.
fred
okrand
no.
mr.
fred
okrand
we
say
not.
and
we
say
we
have
authority
for
that
in
the
wieman
case
where
this
court
repeated
what
it
had
been
said
in
the
mitchell
case
that
congress
could
not
pass
a
law
which
says
that
no
jew,
republican
or
negro
could
be
employed.
now,
congress
can't
do
that.
the
county
of
los
angeles
couldn't
do
it
nor
could
the
county
of
los
angeles
have
discharge
a
temporary
employee
for
being
a
jew,
a
republican
or
negro.
and
we
say
that
the
county
of
los
angeles
cannot
discharge
a
temporary
employee
for
merely
refusing
to
answer
on
proper
constitutional
ground
before
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fred
okrand
they
are
not.
mr.
fred
okrand
we
think
there
may
be
a
difference
in
a
case
where
no
reason
may
be
given
and
a
case
where
it's
clearer
that
the
reason
that
is
given
is
an
unconstitutional
reason.
mr.
fred
okrand
right.
if
you
discharge
a
person
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
you
can't
do
that.
that's
the
--
as
we
read
wieman
and
that's
as
we
read
slochower.
we
just
--
we
think
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
protects
the
citizen
from
arbitrary
conduct
by
his
government.
and
it
--
to
go
a
little
further,
it
protects
an
applicant
to
a
job
from
arbitrary
conduct
by
his
government
and
in
this
case,
it
protects
an
employee
from
arbitrary
discharge
by
his
government.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
if
--
if
they
--
if
we
--
if
they
didn't
give
a
reason
but
even
if
we
could
prove,
if
we
could
prove
that
it
was
unconstitutional
reason,
we
would
go
that
far
and
say
that
the
due
process
clause
would
protect
him.
usually,
it
can't
prove
--
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
as
mr.
wirin
--
mr.
fred
okrand
--
said
this
is
embarrassing,
we
can
raise
that.
we
raise
it
in
our
petition.
it's
clear
there.
it's
very
clear
as
clear
as
any
lawyer
ought
to
make
it,
but,
your
honor,
we
did
not
press
it
in
the
appellate
courts.
mr.
fred
okrand
so
it's
in
the
record
in
the
sense
that
we
raised
it
but
we
did
not
press
it
in
the
appellate
courts.
mr.
fred
okrand
it's
there.
mr.
fred
okrand
we
hope
so,
we
think
so.
we
think
so.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
it's
--
it's
there
in
black
and
white
in
this
record
raised
by
us.
but
we
--
we
can't
tell
this
court
that
we
urged
upon
the
district
court
of
appeal
or
even
upon
the
supreme
court
on
petition
for
hearing.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
we
are
present.
we're
permitted
to
press
it,
we
do
press
it.
i
see
i'm
through
just
one
more
thing
on
this
record
7.
let
me
just
say
this,
your
honor.
in
context,
well,
mr.
pillsbury
said,
the
employee
does
not
care
to
offer
any
evidence
or
testimony
as
this
time.
what
he
said
was
and
what
he
meant
was
the
employee
does
not
care
to
offer
any
more
evidence
at
this
time.
he
had
already
offered
evidence
showing
his
fitness
for
employment.
so
that's
the
way
this
sentence
should
be
read.
mr.
fred
okrand
i
don't
know.
mr.
fred
okrand
we
have
no
construction
of
that
face
of
the
case.
mr.
fred
okrand
the
statute
--
mr.
fred
okrand
--
the
statute
would
say
he
had
to
be
filed.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
mr.
fred
okrand
the
mass
case
puts
that
kind
of
a
gloss
on.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
mr.
fred
okrand
that's
right.
mr.
fred
okrand
i
agree
with
that.
we
say
however
that
the
speiser
case
says
that
they
can't
put
that
burden
on
us
within
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
fred
okrand
that's
--
mr.
fred
okrand
--
first
to
a
temporary
employee,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
the
--
the
permanent
employee
has
a
right
to
a
full
hearing.
that's
the
distinct
--
that
--
they
only
cite
that
to
show
that
a
temporary
employee
has
no
right
to
a
hearing.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes.
he's
entitled
to,
he
didn't
though.
