mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
if
the
court
please.
i
want
to
make
one
correction
with
reference
to
globe.
counsel
stated
and
i
think
inadvertently
that
he
was
a
probationary
employee.
he
was
not
--
he
was
merely
a
temporary
employee.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
and
the
difference
is
that
a
temporary
employee
was
setup
in
the
rules
to
take
the
place
of
somebody
who
maybe
absent
for
temporary
spasmatic
work.
a
probationer
is
afforded
to
a
regular
position
and
during
a
six-month
period,
he
has
--
doing
which
he
proves
himself
then
he
becomes
permanent.
and
globe
was
--
what
they
call
a
temporary
eligible
employee
and
day
to
day
employee
might
have
been
let
go
on
any
afternoon
at
5
o'clock
work
thus
won't
let
him
go.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
yes.
it
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
--
whether
in
the
record
the
rules
on
temporary
employees,
i
have
certified
copies
in
here.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
yes.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
right.
these
are
temporary
employees
and
could
be
let
go
at
anytime
and
if
they
were
not
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
the
civil
service
commission.
one
statement
with
respect
to
the
hearing
which
mr.
nelson
had
before
the
civil
service
commission,
we
thought
we
were
complying
with
slochower
in
that
kind
of
a
hearing
and
that
the
purpose
of
it
was
for
mr.
nelson
if
he
wished
to
explain
why
he
had
taken
the
stand
he
did
take
before
the
house
un-american
activities
committee.
at
the
close
of
the
civil
service
hearing,
nobody
had
put
on
any
testimony
however
it
was
--
had
been
these
various
exhibits
which
mr.
wirin
has
referred
to.
at
the
close
of
the
hearing,
the
chairman
asked
mr.
pillsbury
who
is
mr.
nelson's
attorney
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
witnesses.
and
he
said
at
one
place,
“perhaps,
mr.
nelson
may
wish
to
testify.”
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
page
5
in
the
record,
he
said
--
mr.
pillsbury
says
“there
would
be
no
other
witnesses.”
and
again
on
page
7,
mr.
pillsbury
says
“the
employee
does
not
carried
or
offered
any
evidence
or
testimony
at
this
time.
he
merely
wishes
to
make
a
statement
through
counsel
as
to
his
position
in
regard
to
his
discharge.”
and
then
the
--
those
sides
rested
and
the
counsel
win
their
arguments.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
he
was
discharged
for
insubordination
and
refusing
to
obey
section
1028.1
of
the
government
code.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
charged
for
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
--
certain
questions
before
the
house
un-american
activities
committee.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
correct.
he
claimed
that.
he
claimed
the
privilege
of
first
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
none
of
it.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
no,
they
--
they
can
for
cause.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
he
was
a
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
medical
social
worker.
what
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
now,
what
--
what
that
is,
i
don't
know
but
that
was
the
title
of
his
--
his
position.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
yes.
[laughs]
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
yes,
sir.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
no,
your
honor.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
no,
he
does
not.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
no,
after
he
become
a
permanent
tenure,
he
can
still
be
discharged
for
--
for
cause.
the
--
the
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
(inaudible)
have
it
but
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
civil
service
rules.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
of
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
yes.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
yes.
they're
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
they
are
authorized
by
the
charter
of
the
county,
the
charter
set
for
the
civil
service
system
and
says
that
the
service
--
the
commission
shall
make
rules
and
the
rules
shall
provide
for
this
and
this
and
this
and
this.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
well,
he
first
--
justice
frankfurter,
the
--
the
(inaudible).
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
true.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
then
he
--
within
10
days,
he
asked
for
hearing
and
go
before
the
civil
service
commission.
and
then
the
civil
service
commission
decides
whether
or
not
my
boss
justified
and
fired
me
because
of
the
cut
my
hair.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
correct.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
no.
it
will
be
just
in
the
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
correct.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
but
he
wouldn't
have
to
necessarily
go
there
to
find
a
particular
reason.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
right.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
no.
there
--
there's
no
--
no
such
thing
as
that
to
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
he
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
the
--
that's
tested
up
before
the
civil
service
commission.
if
that
--
they
will
(inaudible)
and
still
feels
aggrieved
then
he
tries
by
mandate.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
now,
there
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
the
authorization
covering
nelson's
case
was
section
1028.1
of
the
government
code
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
--
the
state
law.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
because
it
says
in
there
makes
the
duty
of
him
to
answer
questions
so
that
if
you
don't
answer
you're
insubordinate
and
subject
to
discharge
the
matter
provided
by
law.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that
is
correct.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
correct.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
because
it
would
bring
to
section
1028
of
the
government
code.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
right.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
correct.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
before
the
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
right.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
correct.
the
--
the
--
under
the
california
law
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
--
he
was
insubordinate
for
not
having
answered
the
questions
and
that's
why
he
was
fired.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
the
discharge
for
not
having
answered.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
the
questions
give
--
or
it
didn't
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
yes,
he
refused
to
fail
--
answer
the
questions
which
were
given
by,
i
think,
mr.
taverner
for
the
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
subcommittee
of
the
house
un-american
activities.
yes,
he
did.
others
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
no,
just
the
ones
that
--
which
we
referred
--
which
where
i
referred
to
when
i
--
in
--
in
the
record.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
yes.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
yes,
sir.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
of
course,
he
would,
your
honor.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
he
could
have
done
that.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
he
could
have
done,
sir.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
right.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
right.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
on
what
ground?
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
on
--
on
what
ground
your
honor?
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
he
was
discharged
for
refusing
to
testify
before
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
--
the
house
un-american
activities
subcommittee.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
no,
he
wasn't
discharged
for
--
for
any
failure
to
give
certain
information.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
right.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
he
was
given
his
opportunity
to
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
--
to
explain.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
and
he
refused.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
page
7
of
the
record.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
no.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
this
is
--
this
is
part
of
the
record.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
the
only
reason
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that's
the
reason.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
and
because
he
comes
squarely
within
the
barenblatt
case.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
that
--
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
and
that
there's
nothing
in
watkins,
there
is
nothing
in
any
other
cases
which
my
mind
go
against
the
way
he
was
handled.
now,
we
come
to
globe
and
our
position
there
is
that
both
mass
and
slochower
referred
to
permanent
employees.
and
as
to
those,
they
--
both
cases
are
very
firm
and
properly
so
that
they
should
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
cannot
be
summarily
discharged.
when
it
comes
to
your
temporary
employee,
the
case
did
not
cover
that
situation,
that's
what
globe
was
and
our
position
there
is
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
therefore
his
discharge
was
also
proper.
mr.
wm.
e.
lamoreaux
oh,
yes.
that's
right.
as
far
as
globe
goes,
he
didn't
like
the
way
he
dress,
the
spirit
of
letting
go.
