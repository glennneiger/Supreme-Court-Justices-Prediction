justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
it
be
legally
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
right
this?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
at
that
hearing,
was
mr.
nelson
re-asked
by
his
employer
with
the
county
three
questions
he
had
declined
to
answer
before
the
congressional
committee?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
--
one
--
one
more
question.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
tap
then
a
defense
to
this
discharge
proceeding
if
he
had
answered
--
been
asked
and
answered
those
questions
at
that
place?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
thought
that
the
statute
said
he
--
it
wouldn't
be
a
defense,
really,
that
he
must
only
explain
why
he
answered
as
he
did
to
the
congressional
committee
and
that
in
fact
to
answer
fully
to
this
civil
service
commission
the
very
questions
he
had
refused
to
answer
to
the
house
committee
would
not
be
a
defense.
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
going
in
circle
on
the
district
court
decisions?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
notice
meager
of
the
cited
decision
which
is
by
mean
in
the
case
of
davis
against
the
university
of
kansas
city
in
127
f.supp.,
it
has
a
good
deal
to
do
with
this
question
129
f.supp.716.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
no.
i
didn't
mean
--
not
at
all.

itself
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you're
making
an
argument
then,
as
i
understand
it,
which
a
little
bit
anticipatory
of
what
your
adversary
may
have
to
say.
your
point
really
is,
as
i
understand
it,
if
i
don't
understand
it
i
want
to
understand
it,
that
this
man
was
discharged
as
the
order
says,
that's
nelson
now,
the
order
at
116
says,
namely,
for
a
refusal
to
answer
these
questions
to
the
house
committee
under
the
ordinance
in
question
and
the
question
presented
to
us
is,
is
that
result
justified
by
that
law
on
those
facts?
isn't
that
our
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
we
(inaudible)
are
we?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
really?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
is
it
one
thing
in
your
view
to
refuse
to
answer
a
congressional
committee
under
an
objection
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
another
thing
to
refuse
to
answer
to
your
employer
who
says
now
you
tell
me
what
facts
are?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
better
read
davis
against
the
university
of
kansas.

now
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
are
the
constitutional
grounds
(inaudible)
what
prohibits
one
from
discharging
another
when
no
reason
at
all
admittedly
need
be
given.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words,
though
you
didn't
have
to
give
it
all,
it'd
be
given
bad
when
you

i
may.
one
last
question

would
the
(inaudible)
have
said
nelson
at
this
hearing
that
would
have
been
a
defense?
justice

been
a
defense
to
have
answered
categorically
the
questions
which
he
has
said
to
have
refused
to
answer
to
the
house
committee?
