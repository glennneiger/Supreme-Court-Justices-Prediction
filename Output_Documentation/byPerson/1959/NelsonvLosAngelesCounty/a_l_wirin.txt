mr.
a.
l.
wirin
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petition
here
involves
the
validity
of
a
discharge
by
los
angeles
county
of
two
of
its
employees
and
initially
very
broadly
stated
the
question
as
whether
or
not
the
discharge
was
that
these
employees
were
so
arbitrary
as
to
violate
the
due
process
guarantee
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
think
perhaps
it
maybe
helpful
if
i
would
state
to
your
honors
in
capsule
form
and
very
summarily
the
factual
situation
or
the
basis
upon
which
the
discharges
were
made.
it
is
our
position
that
the
discharge
--
the
discharge
of
both
petitioners
by
the
county
was
solely
because
of
their
appearance
under
subpoena
before
a
committee
of
congress,
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities
upon
which
appearance
both
defendants
refused
to
answer
certain
questions
pertaining
to
affiliation,
pertaining
to
a
communist
affiliation
upon
--
based
upon
the
fifth
amendment
as
well
as
the
first.
it
is
our
further
contention
that
the
inquiry
conducted
by
the
federal
agency,
house
committee
on
un-american
activities
was
wholly
unrelated
to
fitness
for
employment
to
loyalty
in
connection
with
fitness
for
employment
by
the
county.
and
our
further
contention
that
both
the
petitioners
showed
the
utmost
candor
and
cooperation
so
far
as
their
employer
was
concerned
by
answering
all
questions
pertaining
to
their
opinion
and
affiliation
when
propounded
to
them
by
the
employer.
and
that
therefore,
the
rationale
if
not
the
decision
in
slochower
against
the
board
accompanied
by
the
gloss
in
beilan
against
the
board
and
in
lerner
versus
casey.
results
in
a
conclusion,
this
is
our
plain
that
the
discharges
here
were
arbitrary.
let
me
put
the
problem
a
little
bit
differently.
in
terms
of
a
statute
of
california,
the
validity
of
which
as
applied
we
are
challenging
here.
that
statute
appears
in
the
petitioners
--
in
the
brief
of
petitioners,
the
white
brief,
on
pages
2
and
3.
these
petitioners
were
discharged
by
the
county
under
this
statute.
and
as
i
say,
as
enforced
against
these
petitioners,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
statute
violates
due
process.
the
statute
appears,
as
i
see
on
pages
2
and
3.
i
shall,
in
a
moment,
refer
particular
to
page
3
of
the
last
paragraph
of
the
statute
about
the
middle
of
the
page.
but
let
me
tell
your
honors
what
the
statute
provides.
it
is
a
--
it
is
divisible
in
two
parts,
and
i
make
the
distinction
and
the
division
because
we
think
it’s
important
to
our
case.
this
statute
imposes
an
obligation
upon
all
public
employees
in
california
to
answer
certain
questions
pertaining
to
affiliation
and
requires
their
dismissal
if
they
do
not
comply
with
that
mandate.
it
requires
such
employees
to
answer
such
questions
when
asked
by
the
governing
agency,
governing
body
that
appears
on
page
2.
that
portion
of
the
statute
is
not
an
issue
here
because
as
i
have
already
said,
these
petitioners
answered
all
questions
asked
by
the
governing
agency
and
fulfilled
every
requirement
of
any
kind
imposed
upon
them
by
the
governing
agency.
but
the
statute
goes
one
step
further
and
it
is
in
that
regard
that
we
are
here.
the
statute
additionally
imposes
an
obligation
upon
all
public
employees
in
--
by
any
governmental
agency
in
california.
when
appearing
was
subpoenaed
before
a
committee
--
a
committee
or
subcommittee
of
congress
that
appears,
your
honors,
at
page
2
where
the
government
code
is
being
quoted
at
about
the
sixth
to
seventh
line
of
the
quotation
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
indeed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
sir.
i
intend
to
develop
the
facts
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
no,
your
honor.
i
merely
now
calling
your
honors'
attention
to
the
text
of
the
statute
and
then
i
would
like
and
i
maybe
want
to
take
some
time,
if
i
may,
to
discuss
the
factual
situation
and
then
apply
the
statute
to
the
factual
situation
in
this
case.
and
i
am
not
--
we
are
not
challenging
the
statute
on
its
face.
we
are
challenging
the
statute
as
applied.
in
a
moment,
i
shall
discuss
the
application
to
these
cases.
at
the
moment,
i
am
merely
just
tell
--
telling
you
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
what
the
statute
provides
so
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about
as
i
move
along.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
will
you
--
will
you
forgive
me
then.
let
me
just
call
your
attention
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
pardon
me.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
all
i
want
to
say
at
this
moment
is
that
the
statute
in
addition
to
requiring
a
person
to
answer
before
the
governmental
agency
of
a
state
also
require
an
answer
--
require
the
employees
to
answer
questions
propounded
by
congressional
committee.
and
then
and
--
and
after
that,
i
should
be
done
with
the
stays
of
it.
your
honors
will
note
on
page
3
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
please,
i
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
your
honor
understand
me
correctly
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
completely.
i
am
attacking
the
statute
only
as
applied
to
these
petitioners
and
what
i
want
to
say
now,
i'm
--
think
--
i
must
say
now
is
that
this
statute
provides
that
refusal
to
answer
questions
before
a
committee
of
the
congress
on
any
ground
whatsoever
and
that
--
that's
in
--
now
on
page
3
in
the
middle
paragraph
shall
constitute
ground
toward
dismissal.
now,
of
course,
the
california
courts
and
--
and
the
respondent
read
the
phrase
on
any
ground
whatsoever
as
we
also
are
compelled
to
read
it,
it
includes
refusal
to
answer
before
a
congressional
committee
based
upon
the
fifth
amendment,
that's
a
ground.
and
--
and
therefore,
the
courts
below
have
held
that
the
refusal
of
the
petitioners
to
answer
questions
falls
within
the
statute
even
though
there
isn't
any
question
of
what
the
refusal
of
the
petitioners
to
answer
questions
was
based
upon
their
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
committee.
now,
let
me
turn
to
some
of
the
facts.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
substantially
correct.
of
course,
the
slochower
statute,
if
i
may
recall
your
--
didn't
talk
about
the
fifth
amendment,
it
was
a
state
statute.
and
it
talked
about
the
invocation
of
the
privilege
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
but
your
honors
substantially
correct.
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
our
statute,
i
was
going
to
say,
is
worst
in
a
way
than
the
statute
of
slochower
because
of
the
comprehensive
basis
upon
which
an
employee
must
be
dismissed
on
any
ground
whatsoever,
but
in
any
event
that
we're
mistaken
about
that.
we
say
that
as
applied
in
this
case,
this
statute
has
the
same
effect
as
the
application
of
the
statute
in
slochower
because
it's
applied
in
this
case.
the
sole
reason
for
the
dismissal
of
these
employees
is
the
fact
of
their
invocation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
when
appearing
before
a
federal
agency
invoking
a
federal
privilege
before
such
federal
agency
in
an
inquiry
by
that
agency
totally
unrelated
to
fitness
for
employment
by
the
county
of
los
angeles.
now,
then,
it
is
conceded
and
there
is
no
dispute
but
what
these
petitioners
upon
their
appearance
before
this
committee
properly
invoked
the
fifth
amendment.
the
committee
finally
acknowledged
that
the
amendment
was
property
invoked
and
the
county
here
concedes
that
the
amendment
was
properly
invoked
by
these
petitioners.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
i
will
accept
that
settling.
i
think
properly
it
goes
a
little
--
includes
legally
and
goes
a
step
further,
suggest
kind
of
a
moral
propriety
but
this
case
doesn't
involve
moral
so
i'll
--
i'll
talk
about
this
case
and
not
the
formal
one
that
my
partner's
argued.
now,
a
brief
word
as
to
the
course
of
these
cases
through
the
california
courts
and
then
i
must
go
down
to
discussing
the
factual
showing
made
by
the
petitioners
from
which
we
ask
this
court
to
draw
a
conclusion
of
that,
the
action
of
the
county
was
arbitrary.
petitions
for
writ
of
mandate
were
filed
in
the
los
angeles
superior
court
in
behalf
of
the
petitioners
except
for
petitions.
the
los
angeles
superior
court
ordered
the
writ
of
mandate
to
issue
in
behalf
of
one
of
the
petitioner,
the
petitioner
globe.
the
petitioner
globe
under
the
classified
system
in
california
and
by
the
county
was
a
probationary
employee.
he
was
summarily
dismissed
because
of
his
having
refused
to
answer
questions
on
the
grounds
i've
indicated
by
the
county.
he
was
afforded
no
hearing
of
any
kind.
and
the
superior
court
took
the
position
that
that
violated
the
--
the
mandate
of
the
rule
in
the
slochower
case
to
summarily
discharge
a
person
for
having
invoked
a
privilege
before
a
federal
agency
and
ordered
the
writ
of
mandate
to
issue.
and
after
the
petitioner
nelson,
the
petitioner
was
a
--
is
a
permanent
employee
in
the
classified
system
of
the
county
and
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
he
received
it.
in
a
moment,
i
shall
tell
your
honors
about
that
hearing
but
the
superior
court
ruled
adversely
to
him.
and
then
at
each
losing
side,
petitioner
nelson
on
the
one
hand,
the
county
of
los
angeles
in
the
globe
case
took
appeals
and
the
district
court
of
appeal
upheld
the
discharges
as
to
both
petitioners.
we
then
filed
a
petition
for
hearing
in
the
supreme
court
of
california,
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
it
precedes
somewhat
analogous
to
the
--
to
certiorari
proceedings
here,
the
supreme
court
of
california
granting
a
review
in
its
discretion.
the
california
supreme
court
divided
narrowly
the
seven-judge
court,
four
justices
voted
against
the
hearing,
three
justices,
chief
justice
gibson
and
justice
traynor
and
carter
voted
in
favor
of
a
hearing
but
it
wasn't
enough
and
so
a
hearing
was
denied
and
now
we're
here.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
justice
clark
--
i
don't
quite
i
say
--
justice
carter,
jesse
carter
who
is
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
carter
who
has
passed
--
no
passed
away.
justice
jesse
carter
and
justice
--
justice
traynor
and
the
chief
justice,
chief
justice
gibson
voted
for
hearing.
now,
i
think
also
we
will
not
be
questioned
but
that
the
sole
reason
given
by
the
employer
that
the
county
of
los
angeles
for
the
discharge
was
the
appearance
of
the
petitioners
before
the
house
committee.
i
think
it
can
--
it
will
not
be
disputed
but
what
the
civil
service
commission
of
los
angeles
county
which
accorded
a
hearing
to
mr.
nelson
in
its
findings
ultimately
against
him
made
a
finding
that
he
was
discharged
because
of
his
having
invoked
the
privilege
of
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
at
that
hearing,
he
was
not
re-asked
the
questions
or
any
question
pertaining
to
or
in
anyway
in
--
in
--
connected
with
the
question.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
yes.
and
it
is
our
claim,
and
i
shall
get
to
--
i've
cited
quite
immediately,
as
to
the
showing
which
he
affirmatively
made
at
that
hearing
pertaining
to
his
loyalty.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
think
your
honor
is
more
right
than
i.
and
i
think
the
statute
certainly
on
its
face
and
we
have
no
construction
of
any
--
by
the
--
by
the
courts
of
california
to
the
contrary.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
no.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
it's
just
how
ignorance
not
to
our
--
it's
responsible
for
him.
not
that
i
disrespect
for
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
for
decisions
of
any
court.
and
we
shall
read
it
by
tomorrow
morning
and
may
have
something
to
say
tomorrow
morning
about
that
if
it's
--
if
it's
helpful
to
it,
well,
i
hope
it
is.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
i'll
discuss
it
right
--
i
haven't
been
--
i
know
by
now.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
certainly.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
yes.
i
--
i
see
some
problems
as
follows.
the
mass
case
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
when
we
had
our
appeal
before
that
court.
and
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
our
case
refused
to
read
the
mass
case.
as
--
as
your
honor
has
just
--
just
suggested
and
has
refused
to
consider
the
mass
case
as
even
requiring
any
kind
of
a
hearing
for
--
for
globe.
he
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
for
globe
is
temporary.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
--
and
the
district
court
of
appeal
ruled
that
the
hearing
accorded
to
the
petitioner
nelson
was
in
accordance
with
the
--
with
the
mass
case.
now,
we
disagreed
with
that
and
expressed
our
disagreement
to
the
supreme
court
of
california.
and
all
we
could
get
out
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
on
that
issue
was
--
was
three
votes.
so
that
we
do
have
a
situation
where
the
california
courts,
first,
the
district
court
of
appeal
and
then
the
supreme
court
itself
by
a
majority
vote
seems
to
take
the
view
that
the
requirements
which
the
supreme
court
of
california
suggest
that
are
imposed
in
mass
have
been
met
here.
and
therefore,
i
think,
were
properly
here
and
i
think
that
this
matter
should
be
resolved
having
--
having
exhausted
all
of
our
avenues
and
courts
in
california
should
now
be
resolved
by
this
court.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
we
think
the
district
court
of
appeal
was
in
error
in
two
respects.
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
--
that's
one
distinction.
on
the
other
hand,
the
district
court
of
appeal
does
not
read
the
--
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
mass
case
as
permitting
us
to
make,
including
nelson,
to
make
a
complete
showing
at
this
hearing
with
respect
to
his
loyalty
and
as
showing
to
the
effect
that
the
same
questions
which
had
been
asked
of
him
by
the
house
committee
had
been
asked
by
the
employer
and
that
he
had
answered
these
questions
with
utmost
candor
completely
and
fully
and
had
completely
demonstrated
his
loyalty
at
the
hearing
which
he
was
accorded
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
before
the
court.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
and
therefore,
let
me
then
come
to
the
factual
showing
which
was
made
by
the
petitioner
nelson
at
the
hearing
which
he
was
accorded
under
california
law,
a
showing
which
we
say
discloses
complete
condor
to
the
employer.
submitting
full
information
concerning
his
opinions
and
his
associations
to
the
employer
followed
by
the
acceptance
of
his
--
of
that
information
by
the
employer,
and
we
think
a
recognition
by
the
employer
that
nelson
was
a
fit
employee.
and
when
i
say
fit,
i
mean
fitness
including
loyalty
in
any
--
in
any
meaning
that
that
word
passed
or
has
been
given
by
this
court.
now,
here
is
what
happened
before
the
commission
and
here
is
the
evidence
that
he
offered
to
the
civil
service
commission
urging
that
his
discharge
should
not
be
made
final.
he
became
a
temporary
employee
according
to
the
record
in
1949.
the
moment
he
became
an
employee
of
the
county,
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
begin
to
comply
with
an
elaborate
investigatory
and
check
loyalty
system
which
the
county
of
los
angeles
had
been
in
effect
a
system
which
this
court
passed
upon
in
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
parker
against
the
county
of
los
angeles,
a
system
which
this
court
upheld.
and
he
took
then
a
--
what
i
would
call
colloquially
because
it's
a
shorthand
phrase,
a
--
a
loyalty
ought
but
a
particular
kind
of
loyalty
oath
imposed
and
acquired
by
the
county
of
los
angeles.
that
loyalty
oath
was
not
only
an
--
the
conventional
oath
of
support
of
the
constitution.
it
had
affidavits
and
it
contained
an
affidavit
to
the
effect
that
he
did
not
advocate
the
destruction
or
govern
by
violence
and
that
he
had
not
done
so,
that
he
did
not
belong
to
any
organization
that
so
advocates,
and
that
he
had
not
done
so,
and
he
was
required
to
list
such
organizations
as
he
belong
to
the
did
and
this
--
this
of
course
he
did
not
do
because
he
was
not
a
member
of
any
such
organization.
in
addition
to
that,
that
list
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
the
entire
oath
attached
as
an
appendix
to
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
parker
case
which
we
referred
to
in
our
brief.
in
addition
to
that,
he
was
required
to
state
whether
or
not
he
was
a
member
of
or
had
directly
or
indirectly
supported
any
of
the
following
organizations.
and
then
there
--
there
was
a
list
of
142
organizations
consisting
of
some
of
the
organizations
that
had
appeared
on
the
attorney
general's
list
of
the
interstates
and
a
large
number
about
this
that
a
special
committee
set
up
by
the
los
angeles
county
board
of
supervisors
had
considered
sufficiently
suspect
so
as
to
make
inquiry
as
to
membership.
and
he
signed
that
oath
and
that
affidavit
and
in
--
and
checked
one
of
those
142
organizations
indicating
that
he
was
--
had
been
a
member
of
it,
namely,
the
united
public
--
the
united
federal
workers.
now,
upon
his
employment,
he
was
expressly
questioned
pertaining
to
his
loyalty,
pertaining
to
his
affiliation,
pertaining
to
his
membership
in
this
organization.
and
your
honors
will
find
if
your
honors
would
look
at
--
for
instance,
page
58
of
the
record.
it
isn't
the
most
--
it
--
it
is
a
long
--
it
is
a
statement
in
longhand
made
by
dorothy
e.white
as
you
will
see
on
page
58
if
you'll
turn
the
page
around.
well,
it
is
an
interview
by
a
representative
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
with
the
petitioner
nelson.
in
the
course
of
which
he
asked
him
about
his
membership
in
the
united
public
--
united
federal
workers
and
he,
with
complete
candor,
stated
he
had
been
a
member
for
two
years
from
1942
to
1944.
and
your
honors
will
note
particularly
the
less
legible
portions
of
this
document
on
page
59
in
which
he
concludes
with
the
statement
in
--
and
this
is
in
her
handwriting
and
her
statement
that
nelson
had
said
that
he
was
definitely
democratic
and
uphold
and
against
all
communistic
principles
the
inter
lineation
of
is
by
the
representative
of
the
county
not
by
the
petitioner.
and
so
having
--
having
told
the
county
about
that
affiliation
and
satisfied
the
county
with
respect
to
his
loyalty,
he
was
employed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
this
was
--
this
was
in
1949,
un-american
activity
is
--
is
1956,
this
is
years
before.
now,
your
honor,
this
is
--
if
you'll
excuse
me,
this
is
just
the
beginning
of
it
as
to
what
i'm
going
to
say
in
connection
with
the
showing
he
made.
this
was
in
1949.
it
was
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
first
got
the
job
in
19
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
he
--
he
first
was
hired
in
1949.
and
that
appears
in
the
record
44
--
at
--
at
40
--
44
and
45.
but,
your
honor,
he
then
resigned
for
personal
reasons
without
any
relationship
to
loyalty
and
reapplied
again
in
april
1952.
and
when
he
reapplied,
and
i
think
i
--
i
--
it
wasn't
clear
in
my
explanation.
when
he
reapplied,
he
then
had
to
take
another
loyalty
oath,
the
same
one.
and
he
then
indicated
again
that
he
would
have
been
a
member
of
this
organization
and
he
was
at
that
time
in
1952
that
he
was
interviewed
and
questioned
and
he
made
an
explanation.
and
this
statement
by
ms.
or
mrs.
white
indicates
that
he
had
made
the
same
statement
about
membership
in
this
organization
in
1949
when
he
was
first
employed.
and
so,
he
was
employed
in
1952
after
having
passed
this
test.
and
the
record
shows
that
at
or
about
the
time,
he
--
he
filled
out
a
questionnaire,
an
elaborate
questionnaire
in
the
course
of
which
he
was
asked
with
respect
to
former
employments.
and
he
indicated,
for
instance
--
pardon
me.
for
instance
in
the
record
at
57,
he
indicated
that
he
had
been
employed
in
a
civilian
capacity
by
the
united
states
army
and
he
indicated
on
--
at
57
concerning
that
employment.
and
at
63,
page
63
at
the
same
time
in
april
1952,
perhaps
this
is
a
little
better
than
the
former
one.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
page
63.
he
had
to
indicate
who
all
his
employers
were
or
whether
he
was
dismissed
or
resigned
and
the
reasons
for
dismissal.
and
your
honors
will
find,
for
instance,
in
the
--
towards
the
bottom
right
hand
column
with
respect
to
the
army
that
he
was
dismissed.
and
then
in
the
extreme
bottom
left
hand,
he
indicates
that
he
was
dismissed
from
united
states
army
giving
--
giving
the
date.
and
a
little
bit
later,
in
a
questionnaire
which
he
had
filled
out,
he
indicated
that
he
had
been
dismissed
from
the
united
states
army
because,
as
he
put
it,
this
appears
in
the
record
at
74,
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page
of
74
towards
the
left
--
left
side
of
the
page,
he
indicates
that
he
was
dismissed
by
the
united
states
army
for
alleged
--
as
the
alleged
violation
of
public
law
808.
and
later
on,
he
was
asked
about
that
and
he
indicated
that
it
was
public
law
808
of
the
77th
congress.
and
that's
the
statute
which
provides
for
discharge
of
persons
in
the
employee
of
--
the
agencies
of
the
government
for
security
reasons
and
--
and
provides
for
--
for
summary
dismissal.
so
he
told
these
things
to
the
county,
the
county
knew
these
things,
and
the
county
thereafter
gave
him
promotions,
gave
him
increase
in
compensation,
gave
him
ratings,
for
instance,
of
--
of
excellent.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
the
relevancy
to
the
legal
question
is
this.
it
is
our
contention
that
under
the
comprehensive
loyalty
check
system
invoked
and
used
by
the
county
as
to
all
of
its
employees
including
this
--
this
petitioner,
the
county
knew
all
about
him,
made
various
inquiries
from
him,
pertaining
to
his
loyalty,
pertaining
to
his
affiliation,
all
of
which
with
respect
to
none
of
which
he
disclosed
any
information,
with
respect
to
all
of
which
he
showed
complete
candor.
and
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
it's
in
--
this
is
in
the
record.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
no,
not
at
all.
this
is
a
matter
which
is
in
the
record.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
but
we
think
that
--
for
instance,
the
statement
which
ms.
or
mrs.
white
represented
the
county
made
as
a
result
of
an
interview
from
him
is
some
evidence
from
which
an
inference
can
be
drawn
that
the
employer
at
least
in
that
situation
was
satisfied
with
his
fitness.
but
now
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
but
now
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
not
at
all.
and
if
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
the
relevance
of
the
matter
is
this.
we
fit
--
we
say
that
we
assume
that
under
beilan
and
lerner,
the
county
was
entitled
to
have
answers
to
the
very
questions
which
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer
before
this
house
committee.
that
the
county
was
entitled
to
had
answers
to
those
questions.
and
that
we
say
the
county
had
received
answers
to
those
questions.
and
that
when
the
county
therefore,
summarily
and
discharged
the
petitioners
solely
because
of
their
appearance
before
the
committee
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
precisely
the
record,
your
honors.
there
is
--
there
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
have
said
that
it
is
probable,
that
a
fair
construction
of
the
california
statute
is
to
the
effect
that
even
though
an
employee
answered
all
questions
of
the
employer.
he
nonetheless
is
subject
to
discharge
if
he
doesn't
answer
such
questions
put
by
the
house
committee
and
--
and
i
would
--
i
would
agree
with
that.
and
this
is
what
i
--
i'm
agreeing
with.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
this
is
where
we
defer.
we
--
we
do
not
say
the
county
took
another
look
in
that
it
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
made
inquiry
of
him
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
no.
i
wouldn't
say
it
was
inaccurate.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
isn't,
i
would
say
this.
this
being
so
when
he
appeared
before
the
civil
service
commission,
he
then,
as
we
claim,
took
on
the
challenge
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
fit
and
loyal
by
offering
evidence
pertaining
to
his
fitness
and
loyalty
by
offering
his
personnel
file
which
showed
not
only
these
matters
which
i
have
adverted
to,
but
which
showed
that
as
of
late
--
as
late
as
january
1956,
that's
three
months
prior
to
his
appearance
before
the
committee.
at
that
time,
there
had
been
an
inquiry
made
in
connection
with
his
affiliation
and
his
loyalty
and
that
he
had
been
checked
as
--
as
satisfactory.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
not
at
all.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
let
me
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
let
me
answer,
your
honor
--
i
--
i
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
--
i
think
not
quite
for
this
--
with
this
--
because
of
this
exception.
had
the
county,
after
these
employees
had
appeared
before
the
committee
and
refused
to
answer,
called
in
these
employees
and
said,
“now,
look,
you
have
not
answered
certain
questions
of
the
house
committee.
we,
in
order
to
determine
your
fitness,
now
want
to
ask
you
some
questions.”
and
had
the
county
asked
the
same
questions
which
the
employees
had
refused
to
answer
before
the
congressional
committee
and
had
the
employees
refused
to
answer
those
questions
to
the
county.
in
other
words,
had
the
county
really
taken
a
new
--
a
new
look
in
the
light
of
what
had
transpired
before
the
committee,
that
would
not
be
our
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
we
say
that
he
made
the
explanation
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
by
--
by
offering
evidence
with
respect
to
his
loyalty
to
the
county
by
offering
his
personnel
record
which
showed
that
he
had
answered
all
these
questions
to
the
county
before
at
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
not
quite
for
this
reason.
the
first
--
first
place
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
in
the
first
place,
i'm
not
claiming
that
--
i'm
not
claiming
the
doctrine
or
of
any
concept
of
res
judicata.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
am
claiming
that
this
case
is
like
slochower
because
i
am
claiming
that
where
an
employer
has
information
concerning
an
employee
and
has
it
as
--
as
recently
as
january
prior
to
the
april
when
he's
discharged.
and
then
the
employees
called
before
a
federal
inquiry,
conducting
an
inquiry
not
related
to
offense.
and
then
the
employer
summarily
discharges
the
employee
solely
for
that
reason.
i
am
claiming
that
that's
a
violation
of
the
principle
which
was
laid
down
in
slochower
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
that
--
may
i
just
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
that
an
--
that
an
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
well,
he
was
summarily
discharged
in
the
first
instance
and
then
he
was
given
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
in
the
second
instance.
now,
as
to
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
my
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
sure.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
is.
i'll
give
it
to
you.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'll
give
it
to
you
in
a
moment.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
let's
look
at
115.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
115.
yes.
the
order
of
discharge
in
the
first
instance
appears
at
the
bottom
of
page
115.
and
contained
in
that
order
are
merely
recitals
of
their
refusal
of
the
employee
to
answer
questions
before
the
house
committee
and
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
115.
it's
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
reads
exhibit
a
to
respondent's
return.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
dated
may
2nd.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
--
and
if
your
honor
will
look
at
page
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
if
your
honor
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
if
your
honor
will
look
at
page
116
at
the
bottom,
you
will
see
that
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
at
the
bottom,
you
will
see
the
recital
which
is
made
by
the
employer
constituting
the
factual
basis,
basis
for
the
discharge.
but
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
quite
right
that
after
nelson
received
this
notice,
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
he
received
a
hearing.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now,
that
hearing
appears
--
begins
at
page
1.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
hearing
after
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
this
order
with
--
as
to
whether
or
not
the
discharge
should
be
made
final.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
yes.
he
re
--
he
requested
a
hearing
and
he
received
a
hearing.
and
as
a
result
of
the
hearing,
the
commission
positive
its
--
its
ruling
in
supporting
the
discharge
on
the
ground
that
nelson
had
refused
to
answer
questions
invoking
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
103.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.103,
104,
105,
perhaps
one
--
beginning
with
104,
indeed
what
the
--
what
the
commission
does
is
to
quote
what
happened
--
the
quote
of
the
exact
transcript
of
the
proceeding
before
house
committee
and
you'll
note,
for
instance,
on
page
104
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
paragraph
7
that
the
--
that
it
says
that
the
employee
refused
to
answer
these
questions
on
the
basis
of
the
first
amendment
supplemented
by
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
and
then
the
board
continues
to
find
that
that
--
that
this
--
this
action
by
this
employee
before
this
committee
under
these
circumstances
constituted
insubordination
under
the
california
statute
and
was
ground
for
and
constituted
the
basis
for
the
discharge.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
precisely.
no
--
no
reason
for
his
dismissal
of
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
these
are
all
the
orders
which
were
made
in
connection
with
his
discharge
by
any
administrative
agency.
the
los
angeles
superior
court
ruled
that
the
sole
reason
for
the
discharge
was
the
appearance
before
the
committee
and
unification
of
the
privilege.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
all
right.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
discharge.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
this
is
the
order.
then
there
was
a
review
of
the
order
before
the
--
before
the
commission
and
the
commission
confirmed
the
order.
now,
at
the
--
the
record
at
123,
your
honor
will
find
the
ruling
by
the
superior
court.
but
--
but
your
honor
--
excuse
me
for
a
moment.
the
los
angeles
superior
court
so
construed
the
matter.
if
your
honors
will
look
at
record
118.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
and
the
beginning
of
119.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
for
instance
the
court
said
in
the
--
in
the
last
paragraph
were
in
the
record
118,
in
each
of
the
cases
before
the
court,
the
petitioner
was
discharged
from
county
employment
upon
the
ground.
what
ground?
only
one
ground.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
ground
--
this
is
the
last
paragraph
on
page
118.
the
ground
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
insubordination
and
the
violation
of
this
section
which
we
are
challenging
as
applied.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
was
trying
to
give
your
honor
a
few
--
an
--
a
facetious
remark,
a
--
a
good
opinion
by
this
--
by
a
superior
court
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
judgement
order.
now,
then,
i
--
i
do
want
to
say
one
further
word
about
--
about
the
record
of
the
hearing
before
the
committee
and
that
is,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
will
bear
with
me,
if
your
honors
would
--
would
look
at
page
96
of
the
record,
you
will
find
a
document
which
we
think
has
a
special
significance.
your
honors
will
note
that
this
document
on
96
purports
to
represent
that
mr.
nelson's
file
was
taken
by
the
sheriff's
office
of
los
angeles
county
on
january
11,
1956
on
the
upper
right
hand
column
and
was
examined
a
file
which
disclosed
this
matter
of
the
employment
by
the
petitioner
by
the
army
as
well
as
the
interview
by
dorothy
e.
white
which
i've
already
called
to
your
attention.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
it's
only
relevant
because
of
our
--
our
insistence,
if
you'll
forgive
me,
upon
our
position
that
the
county
was
at
all
times
completely
satisfied
with
the
loyalty
of
this
employee
and
that
the
--
and
--
and
we're
trying
to
demonstrate
beyond
any
peradventure
of
the
doubt
that
the
sole
--
and
perhaps
we've
already
done
it
and
now
just
bringing
calls
to
--
to
an
unnecessary
place
that
the
sole
reason
for
the
discharge
was
because
of
the
conduct
of
the
petitioners
before
the
committee
and
not
because
of
any
relationship
to
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
but,
you
see,
the
respondent
takes
the
position
that
somehow
or
rather
the
conduct
of
these
petitioners
before
the
committee
is
related
to
their
loyalty
to
the
county
and
to
their
fitness
for
employment.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
we
are
trying
to
negate
that.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no
board
and
no
court
upon
the
discharge
of
either
of
the
petitioners
on
the
ground
of
lack
of
loyalty
to
the
county,
but
solely
on
the
ground
that
i've
indicated.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
precisely.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
he
also
said
the
first
amendment,
but
he
always
said
the
fifth
when
he
said
the
first.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
think
perhaps
so
for
the
following
reason.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
perhaps
so
for
the
following
reason,
may
i
state
the
reason?
this
leads
me
to
my
--
to
my
next
argument.
it
seems
to
us
that
where
a
discharge
of
a
county
employee
would
demonstrate
this
fitness
is
based
because
of
his
refusal
to
answer
for
federal
agency
upon
invoking
the
fifth
amendment.
but
certain
constitutional
considerations
and
broad
policy
considerations
come
into
play
which
might
not
come
into
play
if
the
refusal
was
merely
obstinate
and
adamant
and
without
the
use
of
the
privilege
for
these
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
the
use
of
the
privilege
before
a
federal
agency
is,
of
course,
a
right
guaranteed
by
the
constitution.
this
court
has
said
recently
and
for
many
years,
it's
one
of
the
great
privileges
and
treasures
of
our
--
in
our
constitutional
system.
it
is
said
that
no
inference
of
guilt
shall
--
shall
fall
as
a
result
of
the
use
of
the
privilege.
and
it
is
said
it
is
available
to
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty.
now,
then,
had
these
petitioners
merely
stubbornly
refused
to
answer
a
congressional
committee?
you
would
not
have
come
into
play
the
--
what
we
think
is
an
important
and
ultimately
over
balancing
consideration
in
favor
of
these
petitioners
that
all
they
did
is
what
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
told
them
they
could
do
at
a
place
where
they
had
a
full
right
to
do
it.
and
that
therefore
a
discharge
under
such
circumstances,
whether
intended
by
the
county
or
not,
has
the
inevitable
respect
of
diluting
or
negating
or
seriously
abridging
the
force
and
effect
of
this
great
constitutional
privilege.
and
of
course,
i
could
have
answered
your
question
by
saying
we
needn't
come
to
that
because
that's
not
this
case.
but
i
do
say
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
--
i
think
not.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
i
think
that
the
--
the
clear
absolute
unequivocal
position
which
the
county
was
taken
was
that
the
refusal
to
answer
questions
of
the
federal
committee
on
any
ground
whatsoever
constituted
a
ground
for
--
not
constituted
but
made
a
--
it
was
a
mandatory
ground
for
dismissal
under
the
statute
and
that
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
the
statute
under
which
the
county
function
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
the
statute
said
on
any
ground
whatsoever
as
applied
here,
the
only
ground
upon
which
the
defendants
--
the
petitioners
now
saying
they
relied
is
the
--
and
--
and
it
is
considered
by
the
county
is
the
fifth
amendment
so
that
this
statute
broad
on
its
face
as
narrowly
applied
to
this
case
involved
a
discharge
of
county
employees
for
having
invoked
the
privilege
before
a
federal
agency
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
it's
essentially
a
due
process
argument.
we'd
like
to
make
also
a
privileges
and
immunities
argument
out
of
it
but
counsel
has
called
our
attention
to
the
fact
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
we
didn't
make
that
in
the
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
state
court.
we
raised
it
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
and
this
is
embarrassing
and
so
we
don't
press
--
press
the
matter.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
it's
one
of
my
arguments.
i
think
the
--
the
broader
argument
which
i
make
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
--
the
due
process
which
this
court
talked
about
in
the
slochower
case
that
a
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
of
course.
well,
i
am
not
saying
due
process,
i
mean
fourteenth.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
--
i
mean
that
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
our
--
our
claim
is
that
an
arbitrary
dismissal
by
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
this
was
our
--
this
is
our
objection
and
throughout
the
california
court.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
yes,
we
have
it
in
the
record.
well,
let's
take
the
petition
for
rehearing.
our
complaint
is
in
--
is
at
page
106,
a
complaint
--
the
petition
filed
in
los
angeles
superior
court
and
you'll
find
our
federal
constitutional
grounds
listed
on
page
109
and
they
are
that
the
discharge
was
arbitrary
and
violated
due
process.
now,
we
say
that,
we
say,
it
violates
due
process
and
constitutes
arbitrariness
for
an
employer
to
be
charge
an
employee
for
having
refused
to
answer
before
a
federal
agency
invoking
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
now,
one
--
one
further
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
yes.
but
--
distilling
our
various
points
and
reducing
them
in
this
court
to
--
to
--
as
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
--
let
me
just
say
this
to
your
honor.
there's
no
question
but
what
--
this
is
our
position
that's
county
counsel
can
help
us
out,
there
is
no
question
about
what
--
throughout
the
california
courts.
we
took
the
position
that
a
discharge
of
this
petitioners
for
having
refused
to
answer
before
this
committee,
whereas
the
refusal
was
based
on
the
fifth
amendment
was
arbitrary
and
hence,
was
a
denial
of
due
process
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
the
slochower
does.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
slochower
does.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
we
think
that's
the
umbrella
which
--
which
covers
us.
and
we
think
it's
the
umbrella
which
covers
us
for
still
--
for
still
another
reason.
because
in
slochower,
this
court
took
the
view
that
a
person
subpoenaed
before
a
committee
may
sometimes
find
himself
in
--
in
an
ambiguous
position
as
a
result
of
which
it
is
appropriate
that
he
--
that
he
invoked
the
fifth
amendment.
and
mr.
justice,
of
course,
i'm
referring
to
the
language
of
mr.
justice
clark
in
that
decision.
i'm
referring
to
similar
language
used
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
--
in
the
grunewald
case
as
well
as
i
think
in
--
in
lerner
versus
casey.
and
i'm
referring
to
somewhat
similar
language,
and
then
i
shall
sit
down
by
dean
griswold
in
his
talks
on
the
fifth
amendment
in
which
he
said
that
often
a
--
a
witness
appearing
before
a
--
a
congressional
committee
find
himself
under
such
circumstances
where
he
may
seek
the
fifth
amendment
as
a
sanctuary
from
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
is
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
one
of
our
grounds,
yes.
and
what
i'm
developing
now
is
that
under
these
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
petitioners'
appearance
before
this
committee
was
an
appearance
which
justified
him
in
using
the
fifth
amendment
because
at
one
point,
the
chairman
questioned
whether
he
was
properly
invoking
the
fifth
amendment
where
they
hadn't
waived
it
and
at
another
point,
remarks
completely
unflattering
to
the
witness
were
made
while
photographers
were
present.
and
so
we
think
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
a
case
where
the
use
of
a
fifth
amendment
by
a
witness
before
a
committee,
when
that
committee
was
not
investigating
his
fitness
for
employment
cannot
be
used
as
the
sole
reason
for
discharging
him
from
county
employment.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
--
we
do
in
our
briefs.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
our
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
if
i
--
of
course.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
time
of
that
(inaudible).
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
because
tremendous
distinction
of
course.
globe
was
given
no
hearing,
no
opportunity
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
to
explain
of
any
kind.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
we
think
the
status
of
globe
that
should
not
disqualify
him
from
relief
in
this
court
because
we
think
wieman
versus
updegraff
and
slochower
against
the
board
drew
no
distinction
between
temporary
employees
and
permanent
employees.
the
employees
in
slochower
included
both
permanent
employees.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
no,
the
courts
below
took
the
position
that
there
is
a
distinction.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
slochower
was
permanent.
in
wieman,
some
of
the
employees
were
not.
and
in
(inaudible),
of
course,
he
was
just
an
applicant
for
--
for
a
license
and
you
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
pardon
me.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
we
--
we
dug
--
we
dug
it
out
from
the
--
both
the
record
and
the
opinion.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
of
course.
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
where
the
committee
is
not
investigating
fitness
for
employment
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
which
should
be
the
only
consideration
that
--
that
should
prompt
the
employer.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it's
very
--
very
strongly
putting
here
but
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
all
right.
my
--
my
partner
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
is
going
to
follow
me.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
we
--
we
are
not
abandoning
that.
we
are
relying
upon
it
and
we
are
claiming
that
the
discharge
by
the
employer
had
the
effect
which
your
honor
called
my
attention.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
precisely
and
exactly
and
completely
our
position.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
we
certainly
will
and
(inaudible).
it
could
be
against
us
[laughter].
