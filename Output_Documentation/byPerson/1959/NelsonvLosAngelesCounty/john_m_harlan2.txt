justice

and
the
difference
between
the
statute
and
the
slochower
statute,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
slochower
statute
in
terms
referred
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
this
one
doesn't
on
its
face.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
substantial
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
correct.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
interject
one
of
the
remarks
you
made.
you
say
the
statute
has
never
been
construed.
do
you
ever
discussed
the
mass
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'll
tell
you
exactly
to
save
your
trouble.
let
me
tell
you
what's
in
my
mind.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
mass
case
came
down
after
slochower
and
it
came
down
after
this
client
of
yours
who
was
discharged
under
this
procedure.
and
as
i
read
the
hearing
that
he
was
given
before
the
civil
service
commission,
it
was
not
the
kind
of
a
hearing
that
the
mass
case
with
its
gloss
on
the
statute
would
have
required.
and
my
question
is
whether
in
light
of
that
later
procedure
required
by
the
mass
case
why
this
case
shouldn't
go
back
for
a
further
hearing
in
light
of
the
requirements
of
the
mass
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
why
we
have
to
reach
the
question
that
you're
imposing
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
globe
is
the
temporary.

well,
if

justice
john

harlan
wait
a
minute.
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
indicates
that
they
were
drawing
an
inference
of
communist
activities,
inference
of
guilt
from
his
claim
of
privilege
before
the
house
american
--
un-american
activities
committee?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
think
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
your
argument
a
due
process
argument
or
is
it
abridging
immunity
--
federal
immunity?
which
in
--
justice
john
m.

--
your
argument?
justice
john

it
isn't
raised.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
your
--
your
due
process
argument
then
which
you
have
to
stand
on
is
this.
that
although
if
he
had
claimed
no
federal
rights
at
all
but
simply
it
refused
to
answer,
california
could've
fire
him
without
more.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
since
he
claimed
his
federal
rights,
they
can't
fire
him
as
a
matter
of
due
process
--
due
process
even
though
the
record
does
not
show
and
there
is
an
expressed
disclaimer
in
the
record
that
they
were
drawing
any
unfavorable
of
--
inference
of
guilt
or
anything
else
from
his
claim
of
privilege,
is
the
your
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
really,
the
essence
of
your
position
lies
in
that
statute?
there's
no
rational
connection
between
the
claim
of
privilege
before
a
federal
committee
and
a
finding
of
insubordination
as
here,
is
--
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that

that's
the
essence
of
your

justice
john
m.

due
process
(voice

--
justice
john
m.

you
didn't
raise
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they've
fired
provided
that
they
didn't
give
any
reason.
justice
john
m.
harlan
tell
me,
did
you
raise
or
didn't
you
the
privileges
immunities
point?
i
understood

your
partner

justice
john

all
right.
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
at
large
incidence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
a
strong
implication
or
intimation
or
whatever
you
chose
to
call
for
the
mass
case
that
despite
the
statute
on
its
face
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
an
explanation
might
be
a
defense.
justice
john

you
--
you
agree
with
that.
