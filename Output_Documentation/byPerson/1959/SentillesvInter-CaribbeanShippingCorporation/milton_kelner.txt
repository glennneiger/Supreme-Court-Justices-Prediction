mr.
milton
kelner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
plaintiff
in
the
trial
court.
the
seaman
was
injured
abroad
ship.
after
a
verdict
before
jury
and
the
district
court
under
the
jones
act,
the
verdict
was
affirmed
on
post
trial
motions
by
the
united
states
district
court
judge.
on
appeal
by
the
defendant,
this
verdict
was
reversed
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
by
a
2-to-1
decision
and
opinion.
there
is
a
dissenting
opinion
written
by
that
court.
the
issue
presented
to
that
court
and
presented
to
this
court
is,
did
the
plaintiff
present
at
the
trial
sufficient
evidence
that
his
fall
aboard
ship
contributed
to
activate
or
aggravate
this
pre-existing
dormant
tuberculosis.
the
facts
basically
were
these.
this
man
was
aboard
ship
as
an
engineer,
the
weather
was
rough,
and
the
emergency
arose
whereby
he
had
to
attend
to
refrigeration
engine
in
the
forward
portion
of
the
vessel.
safety
lines
had
not
been
strong
on
his
way
back
after
having
taken
care
of
the
fire.
the
vessel
suddenly
fell
away
from
under
him,
the
--
the
20-foot
wave
at
vessel
is
toasting
at
a
15
to
20
degree
angle.
when
he
fell,
he
fell
on
his
left
side
injuring
his
side,
his
hip,
his
head,
his
shoulder,
his
leg.
a
wave
swept
over
him,
washing
him
at
distance
of
approximately
24
feet,
and
unfortunately,
his
legs
were
spreadly
--
was
caught
on
the
chain
at
the
edge
of
the
vessel.
in
the
process,
he
inhaled
water.
before
this
accident,
he
had
felt
well
and
knew
nothing
whatsoever
about
any
chest
difficulties,
chest
complaints
or
tuberculosis.
immediately
after
this
accident,
he
felt
badly,
he
had
a
cough,
a
heavy
cold,
he
felt
as
tough
he
had
the
flu.
the
ship
was
tree
days
out
of
port,
the
port
of
miami,
and
in
those
three
days,
the
capital
of
the
vessel
treated
him
with
pills,
penicillin,
treated
him
for
this
heavy
cough,
heavy
cold.
when
he
hit
the
port
of
miami,
he
thought
all
he
had
was
a
cold
from
being
washed
by
the
water
and
the
blow
to
the
side
which
restricted
his
breathing
and
so
on.
and
he
went
up
to
new
york.
he
was
at
the
hotel
new
york
and
couldn't
shake
the
colds
and
went
to
see
the
hotel
doctor
up
there.
the
doctor
examined
him
so
that
he
had
a
flu
at
level
in
his
lungs
and
said
that
he
needed
hospitalization
immediately.
the
plaintiff
returned
to
his
home
in
new
orleans,
went
to
see
his
family
doctor.
now,
his
family
doctor
had
examined
him
regularly,
no
less
than
five
or
six
times
in
the
year
before
the
accident.
x-rays
of
this
man's
chest
take
him
as
recently
as
too
much
before
he
fell,
had
fail
to
disclose
any
tuberculosis.
on
re-examination
of
this
x-rays,
however,
there
was
found
to
be
a
small
infiltration,
a
small
healed
tubercular
lesion
that
was
missed
on
the
initial
examination.
now,
it
is
to
be
noticed
that
in
this
factual
situation,
the
healed
tubercular
lesion,
small
one,
was
on
the
left
side
and
the
left
lung.
this
man
found,
received
those
(inaudible)
on
the
left
side,
left
side
of
his
lung.
the
tuberculosis,
when
it
developed,
full-blown
tuberculosis
was
in
his
left
lung.
the
medical
testimony
was
that
a
blow
to
the
chest
can
caused
an
inactive
tuberculosis
to
become
active
full-blown
and
progress
rapidly.
now,
what
test
then
is
to
be
applied
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
blow
to
the
chest
plus
this
other
factual
background
that
i've
given
to
you,
aggravated
or
activated
his
preexisting
dormant
tuberculosis.
the
cases
are
uniform,
and
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
law.
the
test
is
that
probability
is
the
chest,
namely,
did
the
blow
to
the
chest
probably
aggravate
his
preexisting
condition?
now,
there
are
three
possible
test
that
might
be
applied.
we
might
use
the
test
of
absolute
certainty.
the
plaintiff
is
not
required
and
no
plaintiff
has
ever
been
required
to
prove
any
such
thing
with
absolute
certainty.
the
test
might
be
possibility
and
possibility
is
not
a
sufficient
test,
so
the
test
is
probability.
now,
then,
what
proof
do
we
have
that
meets
this
test
of
probability?
we
have
two
doctors.
one
of
which,
eminently,
well-qualified
tuberculosis
specialist
who
stated,
he
was
one
of
the
treating
positions.
he
stated,
and
we've
quoted
his
testimony
in
our
reply
brief.
he
stated
that
this
blow
in
his
opinion
probably
aggravated
the
preexisting
condition.
another
doctor
stated
not
--
not
less
than
three
times,
and
we've
quoted
that
in
our
reply
brief,
that
the
blow
probably
aggravated
his
preexisting
condition.
now,
i
suggest
that
the
proof
presented
to
the
trial
court
meets
the
test
of
probability
and
that
the
jury
was
entitled
to
--
to
believe
the
proof.
mr.
milton
kelner
no
sir.
mr.
milton
kelner
the
only
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
fifth
circuit
was
the
issue
of
medical
causation,
it
was
--
this
was
the
sole
issue.
i
suggest
that
this
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
is
self-contradictory
and
is
a
most
unusual
opinion.
i
suggest
that
the
fifth
circuit
court
ignored
the
testimony
of
both
these
two
doctors.
and
i
suggest
that
this
fifth
circuit
opinion
require
the
plaintiff
to
prove,
not
probability
but
certainty,
because
in
reading
the
opinion,
you'll
see
that
the
court
said,
“dr.
jacobs
did
not
eliminate
all
other
causes,
but
we
are
not
required
to
do
that.”
now,
i
suggest
that
this
opinion
says
the
test
is
probability.
in
the
opinion,
it
says,
“dr.
jacobs
testified
probability.”
yet,
we
say
that
that
does
not
meet
the
test.
now,
there
is
one
other
matter
that
should
be
mentioned.
the
plaintiff,
when
he
felt,
sustained
certain
admitted
injuries
even
a
part
from
his
tuberculosis,
namely,
the
headache
that
he
had
for
a
while
that
a
blow
to
the
chest,
the
scrape
marks,
the
bruises
that
he
had,
the
injuries
to
the
leg,
to
the
hip.
how
can
the
fifth
circuit
court
disregard
the
admitted
proof
of
positive
injuries?
in
the
defendant's
brief,
they
don't
even
bother
to
try
to
meet
this
because
it
can
not
be
met.
they
--
the
fifth
circuit
court,
by
this
opinion,
has,
in
effect,
attempted
to
reevaluate
the
evidence
and
supplant
its
evaluation
of
the
evidence
for
that
of
the
jury.
and
i
suggest
to
that
appellate
courts
have
enough
to
do
without
reevaluating
and
acting
as
a
jury.
if
i
have
not
proven
probability
by
four
statements
in
the
record
by
doctor
stating
probability,
then
how
many
times
must
i
get
it
into
the
record
that
we
have
probability?
i
suggest
that
the
plaintiff
--
now,
there
--
i
should
mention
that
at
the
trial
level,
this
matter
from
beginning
to
end
was
bitterly
contested
right
down
to
the
wire
on
every
witness
on
practically
every
question.
and
it
is
true
that
the
jury
could
have
reached
the
same
result
that
the
fifth
circuit
reached.
but
fortunately,
for
the
plaintiff,
it
did
not.
on
appeal,
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
all
of
the
favorable
testimony
and
inferences
in
its
favor,
and
counsel
for
the
defendant
cannot
state
that
any
of
the
facts
i've
stated
are
not
supported
by
the
record.
now,
the
fifth
circuit,
in
its
opinion,
has
failed
to
follow
even
its
own
opinions.
under
the
--
the
test
under
the
jones
act,
for
example,
as
they
have
stated
it
in
the
liberty
mutual
company
case,
171
f.2d
723,
is
the
same
that
i
have
enunciated,
namely,
a
question
whether
the
disability
was
approximately
caused
or
materially
contributed
to
by
his
accidental
injury.
now,
in
that
case,
as
in
this
case,
the
witnesses'
statements
on
cross-examination
are
somewhat
inconsistent
but
said
the
fifth
circuit.
in
the
liberty
mutual
case,
the
witnesses'
inconsistent
statements
present
a
question
for
jury,
it
is
the
function
of
the
jury
to
reconcile
or
believe
or
disbelieve.
the
opinion
itself,
hence
the
most
unusual,
the
opinion
itself,
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion
cites
the
case
of
chicago
great
western
railway
company
versus
smith,
228
f.2d
180.
if
you
read
the
opinion,
you'll
see
that
we
have
the
same
basic
problem.
the
doctor
on
direct
examination
stated
his
opinion
that
the
acts,
and
it
caused
the
plaintiff's
injuries.
so
on
cross-examination,
the
doctor
said,
“the
injury
could
have
been
caused
by
the
accident
or
lifting,”
and
he
could
not
tell
which
had
precipitated
the
plaintiff's
injuries,
nevertheless,
said
the
eight
circuit
in
that
case
but
again
re-affirm
by
the
fifth
circuit
by
citing
it.
that
was
sufficient
to
support
the
jury's
verdict.
now,
under
the
ferguson
case,
decided
by
this
court,
352
u.s.
521,
the
test
under
the
jones
act
whether
the
proofs
justify
with
reason
the
conclusion
that
the
employer's
negligence
played
any
part
even
the
slightest
in
producing
the
injuries.
we
respectfully
submit
that
we
have
more
than
met
this
proof.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
denied
this
man
by
its
verdict,
has
deny
this
man
his
right
to
a
trial
by
jury,
has
taken
away
his
jury
verdict,
has
attempt
to
the
act
as
a
jury,
has
usurp
the
functions
of
the
jury.
we
ask
that
the
verdict
to
reinstate
it.
mr.
milton
kelner
i
have
only
one
comment
to
make,
mr.
beckham,
and
i
tried
this
case
in
the
trial
court.
his
argument
today
is
the
same
summation
he
gave
to
the
jury.
it
was
a
very
final
event.
it's
a
--
very
final
now.
but
i
still
think
it's
a
question
for
the
jury
to
decide.
the
question
was
raised
as
to
the
judge's
dissenting
opinion.
you'll
notice
that
in
my
briefs,
i
did
not
mention
the
judge's
dissenting
opinion
because
i
could
find
no
case
to
sustain
that
dissenting
opinion.
in
fairness
to
this
court,
i
should
mention
that
i
checked
this
carefully
as
i
could
for
limit
of
my
limited
ability
and
found
no
case.
did
this
dissenting
opinion
present
a
very
interesting
problem?
is
this
question
so
different
from
every
other
question
that
we
require
special
rules?
or
is
this
a
matter
of
proof
like
any
other
item
of
proof?
that's
again
an
assuming
thing.
