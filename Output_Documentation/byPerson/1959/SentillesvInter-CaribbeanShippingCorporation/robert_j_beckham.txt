mr.
robert
j.
beckham
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
most
strikingly
impressed
by
the
admission
of
my
adversary
that
there
is
no
issue
here
as
to
negligence
that
the
only
issue
here
is
involving
a
factual
situation,
and
that
his
complaint
is
that
an
appellate
court
sat
in
reevaluation
of
the
facts.
and
i
think
it's
obvious
that
the
only
reason
we
are
here
today
is
because
the
petitioner
now
seeks
to
have
this
court
sit
a
reevaluation
of
the
facts.
the
very
thing
he
decries
has
having
occurred
in
the
fifth
circuit.
i
would
like
to
make
these
comments
about
the
--
the
argument
of
the
petitioner.
i
think
the
court
will
find
several
factual
inconsistencies
in
that
argument
by
reference
to
the
record
here.
this
gentleman
was
about
40
years
old.
he
was
hired
by
the
inter-caribbean
shipping
corporation
as
a
general
manager
and
the
overseer
of
the
company
operations
in
conjunction
with
the
management
of
a
banana
boat
running
from
florida
and
from
the
gulf
coast
down
into
central
and
south
america.
mr.
sentilles
was
and
is
a
refrigeration
engineer,
he
is
not
a
seaman.
mr.
sentilles,
on
this
occasion,
as
the
manager
of
the
vessel,
signed
himself
on
and
placed
himself
on
the
ship
as
a
member
of
the
crew.
this,
of
course,
was
done
without
any
opportunity
for
the
company
to
have
a
physical
examination
of
the
man
or
to
go
through
the
ordinary
and
customary
pre-sign
on
investigations
and
examinations
that
often
occur
when
seaman
first
go
to
sea
for
a
shipping
company.
mr.
sentilles
is
being
in
charged
of
the
vessel,
in
charged
the
operations'
bypass
such
a
procedure
with
himself.
now,
after
this
accident,
it
became
apparent
for
the
first
time
through
the
histories
that
he
gave
to
positions
both
prior
practice
and
in
the
hospital
that
he
had
a
most
remarkable
history,
remarkable
in
that
it
was
right
down
the
line
consistent
with
a
slowly
developing
progressive
tubercular
condition
in
the
very
area
that
he
seeks
to
him
liability
upon
this
defendant
for.
it
is
shown
by
the
record
that
for
a
period
of
at
least
six
to
eight
months,
mr.
sentilles
had
persistent
nights
which
--
persistent
at
a
recurring
colds
that
he
was
unable
to
shake
off,
a
deep
and
persistent
hoarseness,
a
general
tired
feeling
which
the
doctors
refer
to
his
malice
and
most
significantly
for
some
eight
years
prior
mr.
sentilles
had
been
a
--
a
confirmed
diabetic.
and
i
might
a
diabetic
whose
condition
was
not
adequately
kept
under
control
by
mr.
sentilles
and
the
words
and
then
the
testimony
of
his
family
doctor.
and
i
think
that
the
court
will
find
also
in
a
reference
to
the
record
that
upon
retrospect
and
upon
examination
by
qualified
tubercular
man,
the
x-ray's
in
1950
and
in
1952,
before
this
alleged
incident
in
1953,
showed
a
developing
progressing
tubercular
condition
in
the
lung.
now,
it's
true
that
the
family
position,
an
admitted
general
practitioner
without
much
experience
and
diagnostic
procedures
for
tuberculosis
did
not
read
these
films
in
1950
and
1952
as
reflecting
tuberculosis.
but
it
is
highly
significant
that
the
experts
and
the
merchant
marine
hospitals
in
new
orleans,
the
tuberculosis
men,
the
chest
men
when
they
saw
these
films
and
examined
the
x-rays
in
conjunction
with
the
man's
history
and
statement
and
with
the
entire
record
before
them,
found
an
enlargement
and
a
constantly
progressive
development
being
reflected
in
these
films.
it
is
highly
significant
also
that
one
of
the
own
--
one
of
the
plaintiffs
and
the
petitioners
own
witnesses,
and
i
might
interject
here
that
the
defendant
and
respondent
was
at
the
trial
and
still
is
content
to
rest
its
case
on
this
issue
with
the
plaintiff's
own
testimony.
there
is
no
medical
testimony
was
adduced
at
the
trial
by
the
defendant.
so
that
everything
before
your
honors
today
was
brought
and
injected
into
the
record
by
the
plaintiff-petitioner.
but
it
is
highly
significant
that
one
of
the
doctors
stated
that
he
himself
tb
man
had
made
an
extensive
survey
and
had
found
that
diabetics
such
as
mr.
sentilles
or
in
his
own
words
inordinately
susceptible
to
tuberculosis,
perhaps,
five
times
as
great
as
a
non-diabetic.
and
so,
we
now
go
into
the
medical
evidence
to
see
just
what
was
developed
by
the
plaintiff
at
this
trial.
we
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
most
aptly
and
correctly
characterizes
this
testimony
for
if
there
was
ever
a
case
where
a
failure
existed,
with
reference
to
prove,
we
believe
this
is
it.
dr.
sherbenie,
the
family
position
the
man
who
they
say
had
seen
him
over
and
over
again
for
years
without
ever
suspecting
this.
dr.
sherbenie's
words,
“i
do
not
honestly
know
of
any
case
that
was
aggravated
by
trauma
or
a
blow”.
dr.
lerdo
(ph),
no
record,
no
showing,
no
finding
that
this
man
had
any
rapid
acceleration
of
symptomatology,
no
finding
of
anything
that
have
happened.
and
he
saw
the
man
within
a
week
or
two
after
this
incident.
diagnose
the
case
as
far
advanced
active
one
year,
active
one
year.
and
this
diagnosis
was
made
within,
as
i
say,
two
weeks
following
this
incident
in
1953.
and
then
dr.
jacobs,
unable
to
say
“whether
or
not
the
diabetes
or
the
trauma
would
be
more
likely
or
would
probably
have
anything
to
do
with
an
aggravation
of
this
man's
condition”.
and
finally
dr.
london,
dr.
london
never
saw
the
plaintiff.
he
was
brought
to
testify
and
answer
to
hypothetical
questions.
and
in
dr.
london's
own
words,
on
several
occasions,
he
was
unable
to
say
whether
it
would
be
malnutrition,
infection
or
trauma.
and
i
think
that
this
is
perhaps
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
entire
record
that
the
trial
judge
on
about
three
or
four
different
occasions
characterized
that
this
witness'
testimony,
this
witness
whose
testimony
and
whose
testimony
alone
really
is
being
urged
by
the
petitioner
as
sustaining
his
position,
dr.
london.
and
if
the
court
will
refer
to
the
record
or
to
the
briefs
where
we
cite
the
record,
as
to
pages
87
and
88
and
89,
you
will
find
on
three
or
four
separate
occasions,
the
words
of
the
trial
judge
in
effect
saying
the
doctor
says
he
can't
tell.
the
doctor
says
that
it
could
be
one
of
the
three.
and
this
was
his
--
counsel
has
stated
a
bitterly
contested
proceeding
and
objections
were
made
and
--
at
this
point,
in
the
record,
an
attempt
was
being
made
to
say,
“well,
the
doctors
already
said
this,
we've
been
through
this.
your
honor,
lets
don't
let
him
be
harassed.”
and
on
each
of
these
occasions,
the
court
says
on
page
87,
i
think
he
has
answered
it,
he
said,
he
couldn't
tell.
that's
on
page
88.
he
said
he
can't
tell
whether
all
three
of
these
or
one
of
them
or
two
of
them
or
even
other
factors
might
have
precipitated
the
condition.
and
on
page
89,
i
think
he
said,
“could
have”.
well,
that
is
why
we're
here.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
i
think
that
there
is
some
different
language,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
i
think
he
did
he
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
yes,
sir,
i
think
he
did.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
yes,
sir,
he
did
testify
that.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
i
--
i
think
that
if
you
will
examine
the
record
immediately
after
the
doctor
makes
his
statement
why
its
apparent
that
this
is
a
complete
contradiction
of
what
he
said
before,
and
the
issue
has
gone
into
again
in
an
effort
to
--
to
get
the
doctor
to
say
what
is
his
testimony.
and
i
think
that
the
final
testimony
of
the
doctor.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
and
then
my
point
--
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
now,
your
honor,
the
last
statement
that
you've
read
was
not
made
by
this
particular
doctor
but
another
doctor
--
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
--
on
--
on
deposition.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
i
think
it
certainly
was
for
the
trial
judge.
i
think
it
was
for
the
trial
judge.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
i
think
however
that
you
cannot,
i
don't
think
that
one
isolative
statement
in
a
record,
one
isolated
statement
when
viewed
in
the
entire
contents,
i
don't
think
that
one
isolative
statement
is
sufficient
when
you're
dealing
with
the
term
of
medical
probabilities
which,
by
its
very
nature,
is
something
a
jury
cannot,
as
it
cannot,
so
many
commonplace
everyday
things
draw
the
same
degree
of
inferences
from
medical
testimony
as
it
can
from,
say,
causation
between
negligence
and
the
injury.
i
don't
think
that
a
single
and
isolative
statement
which
is
immediately
withdrawn
and
retracted
from
--
on
cross-examination.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
sufficient
for
a
jury
to
infer
from
because,
as
i
say,
these
things
are
peculiarly
within
analogy
of
the
position
except
to
the
extent
that
i
think
this
court
could
take
judicial
knowledge
that
tuberculosis
is
a
slowly
developing
process.
it's
not
a
disease
that
comes
upon
a
person
with
a
snap
of
a
finger.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
galloping
consumption,
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
is
before
my
time.
i
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
phraseology.
but
i
do
think
and
it
has
been
done
in
other
cases
that
the
courts
have
taken
judicial
knowledge
of
this
fact.
and
i
believe
you
will
find
cited
in
our
briefs,
authorities
to
that
effect.
and
we
say
that
--
that
the
characterization
of
the
testimony
by
the
trial
judge,
i
think,
he,
being
there
on
the
scene,
he
is
knowing
--
frankly,
it
was
quite
a
shock
to
us
when
he
did
not.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
well,
as
i
recall
judge
reeves'
position,
it
was
that
he
felt
there
was
enough
there
and
that
the
jury
could
infer.
and
as
--
that
goes,
i
think,
to
my
point,
mr.
justice,
that
a
jury
cannot
be
and
should
not
be
given
the
same
latitude
when
--
when
dealing
with
a
technical
and
complicated
medical
question
which
is
wholly
be
--
wholly
formed
to
the
commonplace
knowledge
of
--
of
a
layman.
i
don't
think
that
a
jury
should
be
or
is
entitled
to
be
accorded
the
same
degree
of
latitude.
i
think
that
if
we're
going
to
find
any
bounds
at
all
and
we
have
certainly
have
them
up
to
this
point
by
the
excepted
criteria
of
proving
by
medical
probabilities,
they
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
--
any
conflict
as
to
the
law,
and
that's
why
we
feel
that
the
case
perhaps
is
a
strange
one
to
the
--
before
this
very
court.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
no,
sir,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
don't
think
they
had
any
special
competence.
but
i
think
they
were
certainly
competent
enough
in
the
law
to
see
whether
or
not
a
burden
had
been
met
that
was
required
under
the
law.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
i
did
not
hear
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
no,
i
don't
think
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
the
court
attempted
to
resolve
a
conflict
in
the
evidence.
i
think
that
the
court
attempted
to
make
commonsense
--
to
make
sense
out
of
the
record,
same
as
the
trial
judge
did.
and
that's
why
i
say
it's
most
--
to
me,
most
striking
that
the
trial
judge
on
the
occasions
said
he
did,
i
think,
four
different
times,
who
was
there
and
listing
and
--
and
watching
as
this
trial
proceeded.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
in
each
case,
and
he
said
the
--
the
doctor
has
stated.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
well,
that
--
that's
he
--
he
disagreed
with
us.
and
that
was
certainly
a
shock.
now,
i
tell
you
that
[laughs]
because
--
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
judge
choate.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
emett
choate.
and
--
ordering
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
judge
on
the
testimony
characterizes
it
as
being
could
have
possibility.
he
said
he
--
he
can't
make
a
statement
as
to
which
of
the
three.
and
yet,
when
we
present
him
with
our
post
trial
motions,
he
did
not
agree.
but
upon
appeal,
the
record
had
been
tried
to
--
prepared,
it
was
not
available
for
the
trial
judge
at
the
time
we
had
our
post
trial
motions.
and
when
the
record
was
presented
to
the
duly
constituted
court
and
upon
examination
in
argument
of
the
record,
they
found
that
our
position
was
correct.
and
it's
our
feeling
that
this
case
--
as
a
case
on
the
books,
certainly,
is
not
inconsistent
with
any
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
it
doesn't
circumvent
any
established
policy
of
this
court.
we
can
see
no
reason
why
the
matter
should
be
reversed
on
the
law
on
the
facts.
adn
we
therefore
suggest
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
writ
either
should
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted
or
that
the
judgment
and
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
affirmed
