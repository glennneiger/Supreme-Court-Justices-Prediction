mr.

chief

there
is
some
conflicting
testimony
with
that,
isn't
there
some
different
language
by
the
same
doctor
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
didn't
he
say
this
on
one
occasion,
“i
would
assume
that
this
exposure
such
as
it
was
to
the
inclement
weather
and
the
trauma
to
the
chest
probably
played
a
rule
in
making
petitioner
feel
worse
at
this
time
and
probably
aggravated
this
condition.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
well,
he
did,
then
the
--
it
was
in
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
didn't
he
also
say
this
when
--
when
the
doctor
said
or
when
the
judge
said,
i
think
it
was
the
judge,
“i'm
asking
you,
isn't
it
your
testimony
that
you
cannot
tell
us
which
on
of
those
was
the
cause
with
any
reasonable
probability
knowing
the
background
that
the
man
had.”
answer,
“i
have
already
testified
what
i
thought
or
that
i
thought,
that
the
trauma
to
the
chest
was
the
precipitating
factor.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
couldn't
the
jury
--
couldn't
the
jury
reconcile
those
statements
if
it
wanted
to
do
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
following
that
very,
very
thing
the
question
was
“restrict
yourselves
to
what
we
know
here.
to
what
we
know,
what
would
you
say
are
the
three
possibilities
on
this
man?
would
they
be
the
three
already
told
us
about?”
answer,
“from
the
information
i
have
gathered
from
the
testimony
from
the
previous
positions
that
examined
the
patient
and
from
the
other
information,
i
would
feel
that
this
man
had
an
aggravation
of
his
condition
following
this
incident,
whatever
it
was
that
he
injured
his
chest
and
the
trauma
produced
an
aggravation.”
that's
on
page
88
of
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
--
then
later
for
this
he
was
asked,
“you
have
stated
that
the
blow
of
the
chest
and
diabetes
in
your
opinion
in
this
case
were
both
contributing
causes
to
the
aggravation
of
the
--
of
the
preexisting
dormant
condition,
is
that
correct?”
“yes
sir.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
another
doctor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
as
to
the
other,
well
do
or
didn't
that
raise
a
conflict
that
the
jury
could
resolve
and
that
the
trial
judge
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
for
the
--
determine.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
