mr.
howard
a.
heffron
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
here
two
creditors
of
a
general
contractor.
the
creditors
are
competing
for
something.
they're
competing
for
the
proceeds
of
the
construction
contract.
one
creditor,
the
united
states,
asserts
that
its
tax
lien
which
here
arose
prior
to
the
proceeds
of
the
construction
contract
becoming
due,
gives
it
prior
rights
to
this
fund.
the
other
group
of
creditors,
subcontractors,
asserts
that
the
trust
fund
provisions
of
new
york
state
law
give
them
a
prior
right.
now,
the
chronology,
we
submit,
is
important.
the
tax
lien
arose
first.
it
was
followed
by
the
taxpayer
entering
into
a
contract
to
do
some
construction
work.
he
proceeded
to
complete
that
contract
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
owner.
shows
in
action
arose
at
that
time.
this
was
property
of
the
taxpayer,
and
it
was
this
shows
an
action
to
which
the
tax
lien
attached.
a
new
york
law
provides
that
the
funds
which
a
contractor
has
due
to
him
on
a
construction
contract
shall,
to
the
extent
that
any
subcontractors
are
unpaid
at
that
time,
be
held
in
trust
for
their
benefit.
and
that
is
where
the
basis
for
the
competing
claims
of
the
subcontractors
derived
from.
now,
what
is
it
that
we're
dealing
with?
the
new
york
state
statute
provides
that
the
subcontractors
have
this
trust
right
only
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
debt
owing
from
the
owner
of
the
property
to
the
general
contractor
taxpayer.
the
effect
of
the
decision
below
in
which
the
owner
turned
into
court
the
funds
which
was
still
owing
to
the
contractor,
was
to
discharge
the
owner
from
any
further
liability
to
the
contractor.
the
basis
for
the
subcontractors'
claims
here
is
that
there
was
money
due
and
owing
to
the
contractor
which
is
held
in
trust.
this
is
the
basis,
the
foundations
with
the
trust
under
new
york
state
law.
the
trust
does
not
arise
unless
moneys
are
owing
to
the
contractor.
the
complaint
here,
which
was
filed
by
each
of
these
subcontractors
in
the
lower
court,
alleges
that
as
a
necessary
allegation
of
their
cause
of
action.
moneys
were
due
to
the
contractor.
the
contractor
earned
these
moneys.
there
is
no
defense
to
the
contractors
claim
by
the
owner.
therefore,
under
new
york
law,
we
have
prior
rights.
now,
we
submit
that
in
that
context
while
the
subcontractors
here
may
choose
to
use
a
verbal
variant
of
the
contentions
which
have
presented
--
have
been
presented
to
this
court
in
previous
cases
that
this
is
precisely
the
same
kind
of
issue
which
this
court
has
had
before,
many
times
in
the
past.
in
essence,
the
subcontractors
are
arguing
here
that
because
under
the
provisions
of
new
york
law,
their
rights
are
impregnable
to
those
of
any
other
creditors
of
the
taxpayer.
for
that
reason,
they
must
also
come
prior
to
the
reach
of
the
federal
tax
lien.
now,
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
argument
which
this
court
has
rejected
in
the
past.
it
rejected
it
through
in
situations
where
the
security
which
the
subcontractor
was
asserting
with
a
lien
on
real
estate.
here,
the
security
which
the
subcontractor
asserts
is,
in
essence,
a
lien
on
a
chose
in
action.
under
new
york
law,
he
has
the
right
to
reach
this
chose
in
action
and
apply
it
in
satisfaction
of
his
claim.
the
government
submits
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
property
of
the
taxpayer
be
real
estate
or
whether
it
be
a
chose
in
action.
the
principle
which
this
court
has
defined
in
the
past
are
equally
applicable
here.
now,
this
court
has
reached
the
issue
of
the
rights
of
mechanic's
liens
as
against
those
of
the
united
states
in
many
situations.
it
has
reached
that,
for
example,
in
the
white
bear
case,
where
the
mechanic's
lien
preceded
was
antecedent
to
the
federal
tax
lien
and
where
everything
had
been
done
under
state
law,
which
would
render
the
mechanics'
rights
impregnable
to
attack.
nevertheless,
this
court
held
that
the
federal
tax
lien
was
superior.
it
had
reached
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
we
would.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
--
we
would
--
we
would
submit
this
in
answer
to
that
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
question,
sir.
that
new
york
cannot
adopt
a
statute
which,
in
effect,
is
a
priority
statute
and
which
gives
a
creditor
of
the
taxpayer
a
preferred
position.
and
then
under
the
guise
of
saying,
“well,
since
no
other
creditor
under
new
york
law
can
reach
this
property,
the
taxpayer
has
no
property.
therefore,
the
government
can't
reach
it.”
we
submit
to
characterize
it
in
term,
what
is,
in
essence,
a
preference
statute
in
terms
of
property
doesn't
--
doesn't
solve
the
question.
the
realities
of
the
situation
would
govern
here
and
in
terms
of
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
the
parties,
we
have
here
a
situation
where
the
subcontractors
are
seeking
to
reach
a
debt
owed
to
the
taxpayer.
now,
we
would
say
that
if
new
york
law
characterized
the
rights
of
the
subcontractors
as
--
as
so
concrete
and
fixed
that
the
taxpayer
had
no
property
interest,
that
that
would
not
bind
this
court
because,
in
essence,
the
new
york
court
would
be
saying
that
the
security
device
which
we've
created
to
benefit
the
subcontractors
is
sufficient
to
defeat
the
federal
tax
lien.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
your
honor.
we
--
we
do
not
concede
that.
we
distinguish
the
case
in
our
brief
which
had
arisen
in
the
second
circuit,
which
involved
a
contract
provision
under
which
it
was
provided
that
if
the
contractor
failed
to
comply
with
certain
conditions,
he
would
have
no
right
to
the
balance
due.
and
we
distinguish
that
case.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
your
honor.
we
say
that
would
be
a
harder
case
and
the
question
would
then
arise
whether
this
court
would
characterize
that
device
which
would
again
be
an
essence
of
method
for
preferring
a
creditor
of
the
taxpayer
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
government
did
lose
in
that
case,
but
that
case,
mr.
justice
brennan,
involved
a
surety
who
held.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
we
did
not.
now,
that
case
involved
a
complicated
contract
with
the
city
of
new
york.
a
surety
who
had
--
had
an
agreement
with
the
contractor,
performance
bonds
and
payment
bonds
and
complicated
contractual
provisions
which
were
designed
to
protect
the
city
of
new
york
from
litigation
which
might
ensue
over
public
housing
project.
and
in
that
case,
the
contractor
couldn't
complete
his
contract
and
the
surety
took
over
for
him
and
on
the
facts
of
that
case,
the
government
did
not
feel
that
the
result
was
wrong.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
sir.
i
was
going
to
point
out
that
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
in
--
in
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
is
right.
there
is
a
case
in
the
second
circuit
which
involves
precisely
this
issue.
in
fact,
it
involves
a
better
case
for
the
subcontractors
because
in
the
kings
county
case,
the
trust
fund
arose
prior
to
the
federal
tax
lien
coming
into
existence.
surely,
if
they
were
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
it
is.
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
well
aware
of
the
subsequent
decision
in
the
surety
case,
which
your
honor
has
alluded
to.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
none
that
i
am
aware
of,
sir.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
it
may
be
that
the
--
the
word
“device”
was
inappropriate.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
what
is
in
the
back
of
my
mind,
sir,
is
that
--
that
semantics
should
not
govern
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
--
i
--
i
would
answer
to
that,
sir,
that
precisely
that
kind
of
social
interest
was
embodied
in
the
various
lien
statutes
of
mississippi,
colorado
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
it
probably
would
not
be
in
the
ordinary
case.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
--
i
would
have
--
i
would
have
two
answers
for
that,
sir.
first,
i
think
the
question
would
be
whether
after
the
federal
tax
lien
has
arisen
and
a
chose
of
action
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer
has
come
into
existence,
a
state
may,
at
that
time,
by
a
statute,
provide
that
that
cause
of
action
shall
be
held
in
trust
for
a
creditor
of
the
taxpayer
other
than
the
united
states.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
of
course,
we
--
we
would
not
conceive
that
the
relationship
created
by
new
york
law
here
is
a
conventional
trust
relationship.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
--
we
read
judge
fuld's
opinion
as
holding
that
the
trust
fund
is,
in
essence,
another
method
for
assuring
security
to
the
subcontractors
and
that
as
a
method
which
assures
security,
it
must
be
tested
by
the
rules
which
this
court
has
laid
down
in
determining
the
validity
of
other
state
methods
for
assuring
security
to
subcontractors.
and
i've
tried
to
point
out
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
certainly
could
be
done,
if
--
if
the
statute
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
is
precisely
our
position,
sir.
if
we
examined
the
nature
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
would
say
that
under
the
new
york
statutes
as
they
presently
exist
that
judge
fuld
had
decided
that
this
was
not
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute
that
he
would
have
erred
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
would
be
our
fist
position,
the
argument
which
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
agree
with
the
petitioners
here
that
new
york
law
defines
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
the
parties.
from
there,
we
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
--
we
would
submit
that
whether
the
rights
and
liabilities
which
exist
under
state
law
is
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute,
is
the
federal
question
which
is
before
this
court.
and
we
say
that
judge
fuld
examined
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
the
parties
under
new
york
law,
as
he
had
the
right
to
do.
he
observed
that
the
trust
which
new
york
law
creates
is
predicated
upon
the
existence
of
a
debt
to
the
taxpayer
and
that
is
his
word
in
his
opinion,
“there
is
a
debt
to
the
taxpayer,”
he
said
in
the
opinion,
examining
the
nature
of
the
rights
and
liabilities
which
are
created
under
new
york
law
and
finding
as
he
have
to
that
there
was
a
debt
owing
to
the
taxpayer,
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
trust
fund
provisions
of
new
york
law
just
as
the
mechanic's
lien
provisions
of
new
york
law
and
the
laws
of
the
other
states,
was
simply
another
way
of
preferring
a
class
of
creditors
to
the
detriment
of
the
federal
government.
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
he
could
not
give
effect
to
the
trust
fund
--
fund
provisions
where
the
federal
tax
lien
had
already
attached
to
this
debt,
which
was
owing
to
the
contractor,
taxpayer
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
that
would
be
our
position,
sir.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
think
it
--
it's
a
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
state
--
we
--
we
set
in
our
brief
and
we
intended
to
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
determine
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
the
party.
but
whether
or
not
to
characterize
the
resulting
conglomeration
of
rights
and
liabilities
as
property
or
not
is
the
federal
question
which
is
before
this
court.
if
we
examine
the
trust
fund
provisions
of
new
york
law,
we
--
we
find
that
what
we
have
here
is
an
animal
which
is
very
far
from
being
related
to
a
conventional
trust.
the
trust
fund
provisions
of
new
york
law
provide,
for
example,
that
the
trust
shall
arise
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
i
did
not
mean
to
detract
from
the
force
of
that
argument,
sir.
i
was
really
addressing
myself
now
to
an
additional
position
which
we
have
here
and
that
is
that
even
under
new
york
law,
the
rights
of
the
subcontractors
are
not
fixed
within
the
requirements
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
so
that
this
is
an
additional
reason
why
they
could
not
supersede
the
federal
tax
lien
here.
now,
i
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
it
does
not.
i
--
that
was
inappropriate
use
of
language.
i
simply
meant
to
suggest
that
--
that
if
an
argument
could
prevail
here
to
the
effect
that
a
security
interest
under
state
law
had
become
so
perfected
and
so
fixed
that
the
taxpayer
no
longer
had
any
property
to
which
the
federal
lien
could
reach,
whether
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
could
be
undone
in
precisely
the
same
situations
where
this
court
has
upheld
the
reach
of
the
federal
tax
lien.
that
is
essentially
what
the
argument
of
the
petitioners
comes
down
to.
this
is
a
security
provision
of
new
york
law.
some
of
the
courts
have
said
the
subcontractors
in
new
york
have
a
double
security.
they
have
the
lien
on
the
real
estate
of
the
owner
and
they
have
the
trust
right
to
the
debt
owing
to
the
contractor.
but
in
essence,
these
are
both
security
methods
by
which
the
subcontractors
can
be
assured
of
payment.
and
what
is
he
assured
of
payment
from?
he
is
assured
of
payment
from
the
chose
in
action
which
he
holds
against
the
owner.
the
owner
is
discharged
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
would
say
to
that
where
the
federal
tax
lien
has
attached
to
a
debt
which
admittedly
is
owing
to
the
taxpayer,
that
the
state
could
not
thereafter
require
that
that
fund
be
held
in
trust
for
another
creditor
of
the
taxpayer.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
of
course,
that
is
an
equitable
consideration
which
is
involved.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
we're
here
dealing
with
withholding
and
social
security
taxes
which
were
withheld
from
the
wages
of
employees
of
the
taxpayer.
and
we
know
in
the
enforcement
of
the
revenue
laws,
the
great
delinquency
is
over
$200
million
which
now
exist
in
withholding
and
social
security
taxes
and
we
know
that
the
pattern
in
the
construction
industry
is
for
contractors
to
take
this
withheld
taxes,
which
themselves
are
trust
funds
under
federal
law
and
use
them
to
operate
there
business.
now,
we
can't
trace
these
taxes
into
the
hands
of
any
particular
subcontractors,
but
i
don't
think
we're
--
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
were
the
federal
government
doesn't
have
some
right
to
pursue
tax
dollars
which
the
contractor
withheld
from
his
employees
and
to
take
them.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
that
is
the
result
of
this
court's
decisions
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
in
a
great
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
line
of
cases.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
--
the
first
case
in
which
the
secret
lien
which
we're
allegedly
dealing
with
here
arose
with
the
snyder
case
in
149
u.s.,
where
a
bona
fide
purchaser
of
the
property
without
notice,
was
held
to
have
rights
inferior
to
the
federal
tax
lien
which
was
not
recorded
and
which
under
state
law
as
an
unrecorded
lien
could
have
no
effect.
nevertheless,
this
court
held
that
the
federal
tax
lien
was
superior.
now,
this
prompted
congress
to
grant
relief
and
congress
has
provided
that
federal
tax
liens
must
be
--
must
be
filed,
if
they
are
to
be
valid
against
four
categories
of
claimants,
judgment
creditors,
purchasers,
mortgagees
and
pledgees.
and
this
court
has
noted
in
the
prior
decisions
that
mechanic's
lienors
are
not
within
the
class
of
persons
protected
by
the
filing
requirements
of
federal
law.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
of
course,
in
this
other
cases,
justice
brennan,
the
mechanics
were,
in
essence,
claiming
that
lien
had
so
fixed
upon
the
property
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
the
tax
lien
to
reach.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
that
is
the
issue
as
formulated
by
the
petitioners.
we
submit
that
there
clearly
is
property
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
it
is
the
debt
owing
to
the
contractor.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
but
just
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
of
course
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
in
the
other
cases
which
this
court
has
passed
on.
there
was
much
language
in
the
lower
state
court
opinions
which
said,
"under
our
law,
the
mechanic's
lien
has
divested
the
taxpayer
of
his
interest.
therefore,
the
federal
tax
lien
can't
attach."
so,
this
argument
has
worked
in
the
record
of
these
cases,
and
it
could've
been
pulled
out
at
any
time
as
the
grounds
for
invalidating
the
federal
tax
lien.
it
never
was.
it
lurked
in
the
record
in
the
kings
county
case
in
the
second
circuit.
and
the
court
there
went
on
to
say
that
although
your
--
the
trust
fund
provisions
of
new
york
law
apply
first
in
time
here,
the
trust
had
arisen
first.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
think
those
were
the
first
cases
in
the
lien
field
which
have
held
that
property
must
be
taken
to
refer
to
interest
created
and
defined
by
provisions
of
state
law.
now,
of
course,
the
--
the
thrust
of
petitioner's
argument
here
is
to
place
him
in
a
position,
theoretically,
which
is
even
more
favorable
than
the
position
which
congress
has
placed
judgment
creditors,
mortgagees,
pledgees
and
purchasers.
because
if
his
argument
should
be
accepted
at
anytime
that
the
trust
fund
may
arise
even
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
tax
lien,
a
time
when
all
the
cases
have
assumed
that
at
anytime
the
government's
rights
were
set,
it
was
when
the
tax
lien
was
recorded
and
filed.
if
this
argument
is
accepted,
even
those
provisions
will
not
support
the
reach
of
the
tax
lien,
because
the
argument
will
be
--
well,
under
federal
--
under
state
law,
you
taxpayer
have
no
property
because
your
--
your
creditor
who
is
subsequent
to
the
tax
assessment
and
who
is
subsequent
to
the
recording
of
the
tax
lien,
has
taken
the
property.
now,
we
--
we
submit
that
that
result
is
foreclosed
by
the
provisions
of
the
statute
itself,
which
indicate
those
classes
of
persons
who
are
protected
from
unfiled
federal
tax
lien.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
think
that
under
the
logic
of
the
decided
cases,
the
court
could've
come
to
know
other
conclusion
in
the
mechanic's
lien
cases.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
we
submit
that
it
can
come
to
know
other
conclusion
in
this
case.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i'd
like
to
point
out,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
criticism
which
has
been
levied
against
the
federal
tax
lien
as
usually
been
--
been
brought
to
bear
in
a
situation
where
the
lien
under
state
law
comes
first.
and
then
the
persons
who've
developed
the
expectancy
are
divested
by
a
--
by
a
subsequently
accruing
lien.
we
have
here
a
case
where
the
federal
lien
is
antecedent
to
all
the
interests,
which
have
been
created
under
state
law.
so
that
even
the
--
those
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
they
don't
necessarily
have
to
equal
the
other.
but
when
one
is
used
to
secure
creditors
of
a
taxpayer,
the
payment
of
his
debt
to
them
in
addition
to
the
lien
it
--
it
--
in
substance,
reaches
the
same
result.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
but
this
court
has
pointed
out
that
it
will
look
at
the
realities
of
the
situation
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
in
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
in
the
gilbert
associates
case
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
of
course
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
we
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
have
--
i
--
i
hope
that
i
have
reached
that
point
and
if
i
may
answer
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
if
i
may
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
terms
of
the
realities
of
interest
under
state
law
and
the
gilbert
associates
case,
which
dealt
with
the
question
of
who
was
a
judgment
creditor
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute.
your
opinion
says
that
we
must
not
look
to
the
label
which
is
placed
by
state
law
in
this
interest.
we
must
look
to
the
actual
rights
and
liabilities
as
defined.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
would
accept
that
statement
because
it's
our
position
that
this
is
not
a
bona
fide
trust.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
thank
you.
