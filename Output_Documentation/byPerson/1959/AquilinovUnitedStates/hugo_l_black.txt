justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
taking
--
this
is
your
view
that
if
this
new
york
statute
should
be
held
sufficient,
it
defies
the
government
of
its
lien?
every
state
could
adopt
the
same
kind
of
law
which
would
--
and
substituted
for
that
lien
law
for
the
same
purposes
and
thereby,
rendered
the
statute
in
effect,
the
federal
statute
in
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
view
--
your
view
is
that
this
is
--
whatever
it
is,
it's
a
method
of
trying
to
give
security
some
credit,
which
defies
the
government
of
the
security
which
the
federal
statute
has
shared
or
given
it
when
the
states
used
the
term
“liens”
instead
of
“trust”.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
assume
your
fist
argument
is
that
he
--
he
assumed
to
decide
--
interpret
the
state
statute,
we
ought
to
follow
it
like
you
do
in
other
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
would
that
make?
that's
not
a
conventional
trust.
i
thought
you're
arguing
for
is
that
they
can't
do
this
under
the
name
of
the
lien,
although
a
lien
has
a
very
high
stakes
in
the
law,
mechanic,
laborers
and
so
forth.
since
they
can't
do
it
in
the
lien
rather
preference
speaks
now
by
the
federal
statute,
if
they
do
it
on
the
name
of
the
trust.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
if
it's
a
very
bad
thing
if
we've
decided
and
probably
this
much
argument
on
that
side.
why
shouldn't
we
overrule
it,
rather
than
to
leave
a
system
in
existence,
were
some
states
can
protect
their
mechanics
and
some
cannot,
until
they
changed
their
laws
with
reference
to
lien?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
to
the
--
do
you
think
the
court's
opinions
are
right
that
have
held
that
this
secret
right
lien
for
the
government
can
be
enforceable
against
a
mechanic
for
his
--
rather
than
to
have
a
preference
over
mechanic's
lien?
do
you
think
they're
sound?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
logical.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
--
you're
talking
about
the
(inaudible)
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
argue
that
the
court
can't
just
wipe
out
all
the
decisions
it
did
accept
--
it
made
which
is
declined
to
give
mechanics
preference
over
the
government,
under
the
government
statute.
