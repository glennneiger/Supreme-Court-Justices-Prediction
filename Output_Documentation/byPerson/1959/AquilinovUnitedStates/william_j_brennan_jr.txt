justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
your
point
is
that
they,
suppose
if
you
have
appreciated
that
this
was
the
decision
of
the
--
made
on
state
law,
whether
the
property
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
result
(inaudible)
difficult.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
friedman,
may
i
ask
what
do
you
say
about
the
state
(inaudible)
if
federal
lien
by
a
government
inserted
against
factual
obligation
that
is
conformed
with
(inaudible)
i
gather
that
some
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
it
isn't.
what
i
meant
here
is
whether
(inaudible)
translation
on
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
(inaudible)
new
york
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
has
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
(inaudible)
what
they
are
opposing
from
is
--
it's
not
the
new
york
statute,
possibly
(inaudible)
section
3670
of
the
united
states
code.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
the
government
(inaudible)
the
general
contractor
by
agreement,
a
provision
of
their
contract
might
have
accomplished
precisely
this
--
that
the
claim
of
the
subcontractors
would
be
honored
as
against
something
which
the
taxpayer
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
that
--
in
that
--
under
such
provision,
you're
saying
that
the
federal
government
that
brings
out
the
subcontractors?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
didn't
held.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
government
didn't
held.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
did
lose
out
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
the
second
circuit
is
that
on
this
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
those
cases
were
usually
a
mechanic's
lien
holders
(inaudible)
were
they
not
only
cases
which
there's
any
doubt
taxpayer
had
property
in
the
thing
they
thought
--
which
they
thought
to
have
liens?
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
there
was
any
property
in
the
taxpayer
with
which
the
lien
was
taxed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
fact
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
fact
is,
however,
no
issue.
i
impose
there
are
a
great
number,
but
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
which
was
not
in
fact
--
that
there
was
property
of
the
taxpayer
and
the
thing
in
which
the
lien
attached
and
the
conflict
then
arose
between
other
lien
claimants
and
the
federal
claim.
here,
the
basic
question,
as
i
understand
it,
is
whether
in
fact
there
was
any
property
at
all
of
this
taxpayer
to
which
any
lien
could
tax,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
happens
(inaudible)
property
of
course,
that
the
issue
is
for
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
had
finally
decided.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
is
that
(inaudible)
where
we
have
(inaudible)
tax
lien
on
the
state
law,
the
property
of
the
taxpayer?
