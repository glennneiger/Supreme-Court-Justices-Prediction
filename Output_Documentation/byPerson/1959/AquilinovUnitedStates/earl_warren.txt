chief

is
there
any
difference
of
opinion
between
the
parties
on
that
score?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
what's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heffron.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heffron,
may
i
ask
you
this.
if
suppose
the
new
york
court
had
held
against
you,
held
that
the
taxpayer
had
no
right
in
this
property
under
this
statute,
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
you
feel
that
new
york
cannot
--
does
not
have
the
constitutional
right
to
so
find.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
--
then
it
is
your
--
it
is
your
position,
i
--
i
take
it,
that
--
that
the
states
cannot
determine
who
has
property
in
this
--
in
these
bonds.
that
it
must
leave
them
with
the
contractor
and
that
if
judge
fuld
had
decided
otherwise,
he
would
have
been
--
he
would
have
been
wrong
and
you'd
be
entitled
to
be
here
anyway
then
reverse.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought,
mr.
heffron,
that
--
that
counsel
said
that
you
agree
that
the
state
did
have
the
right
to
declare
the
property
rights
and
i
thought
you
cited
bess
and
other
cases
in
your
--
in
your
opinion
or
in
your
brief
to
that
effect.
but
i
thought
that
you
relied
on
--
on
judge
fuld's
opinion
to
the
effect
that
new
york
law
did
not
confer
this
property
right
on
the
subcontractors
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
therefore,
we
should
affirm
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
does
that
mean
property
rights
on
the
parties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it's
your
position
that
he
could
arrived
no
other
conclusion
that
if
he
had,
you
would
have
been
wrong
and
should
have
been
reversed
by
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
does
--
does
your
brief
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
your
--
i
thought
your
brief
said
in
several
places
here
which
you
call
bess
case
and
other
cases
that
the
state
had
the
right
to
determine
in
whom
the
property
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heffron,
i
understand
that
the
government
made
this
assessment
against
the
taxpayer
--
against
the
contractor
before
he
entered
into
this
contract
with
mrs.
bottone.
but
that
--
that
fact
was
not
known
to
anyone,
but
the
government.
and
there
was
no
way
that
materialmen
or
laborers
could
--
could
determine
whether
that
assessment
had
been
made
and
that
thereafter,
this
contractor
entered
into
the
contract
for
this
improvement
and
these
materialmen
and
laborers,
put
there
materials
and
their
labor
into
this
job.
now,
if
the
federal
assessment
against
this
taxpayer
was
more
than
he
had
coming
from
the
--
from
the
owner
of
the
property
or
the
judge.
do
you
say
is
a
practical
matter
that
the
state
could
not
protect
those
workmen
and
those
materialmen
to
such
an
extent
that
they
could
get
that
from
that
transaction,
the
value
of
the
property
and
the
value
of
the
labor
that
they
put
into
it
that
they'd
be
entirely
wiped
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
believe
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
believe
the
state
is
deprived
to
that
power
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
