justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
--
the
utmost
thing
that
you
could
ask
from
this
court
or
is
it
the
utmost
thing
that
--
which
indicates
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
them
ascertain,
it's
a
little
presumptuous
to
tell,
for
us,
to
tell
them
they
should
have
statements
to
new
york
law
and
so
judge
fuld
and
company
wouldn't
have
pursued
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
another
one
is
that
we
should
decide
what
new
york
law
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
require
for
us
to
decide
new
york
law
which,
for
some
reason
or
other,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
in
your
point
of
view,
it
wouldn't
do,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
couldn't
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
what
justice
fuld
said
the
(inaudible)
means
that
the
kind
of
--
of
interest
that
the
subcontractor
has
or
the
kind
of
obligations
which
the
contractor
holds
under
the
new
york
law
is
not
competent
or
rather
is
proper
that
the
--
that
that
(inaudible)
contractor
had,
although
he
may
hold
them
in
trust,
as
you
say
to
the
subcontractor
in
the
--
into
the
labor
and
so
on,
is
not
called
property
under
3670.
and
therefore,
they're
construing
not
the
new
york
law,
but
they're
construing
the
federal
law
as
to
what
constitutes
profit
and
they
exclude
therefrom
ownership,
title
ownership
though
is
subject
to
a
trust,
is
not
--
is
nevertheless
property
in
that
sense,
in
the
federal
sense.
is
that
what
they
are
doing?
and
thereby,
construing
a
federal
statute
which
is
open
to
(inaudible)
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
unlikely.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
it's
wrong
or
not,
it
is
not
a
determination
which
forecloses
us
from
reconsidering
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wouldn't
help
you,
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
unambiguously
had
disagreed
with.
but
my
reading
of
it,
they
do
not
unambiguously
disagree
with
you,
but
they
say
this
kind
of
interest
is
not
property
within
the
federal
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
said
some
time
that
a
device
for
avoiding
the
power
to
the
federal
government.
does
one
have
to
characterize
the
protection
of
--
of
the
interest
of
people
like
subcontractors
and
laborers
and
devices
may
they
not
be
--
didn't
the
question
really
whether,
if
a
state
court
works
how
to
scheme
of
fiduciary
relations
of
a
trust,
thereon
social
interest
which
the
state
may
protect,
although
in
consequence,
the
government
priority
maybe
secondary.
why
do
you
call
it
a
device?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
that's
in
the
back
of
your
mind
as
to
what
these
things
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
semantics
either.
i'm
taking
about
the
real
social
policy
by
a
state
to
fix
the
dedicate
trust
interest
upon
funds
like
this
in
order
to
protect
people,
in
the
opinion
of
the
legislature
of
a
state,
may
need
protection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
lien
statute.
doesn't
--
that
may
be
the
purpose
of
the
lien
statute,
but
the
question
is,
a
construction
whether
on
words,
property,
preclude
honest
to
god,
trustees
that
he
could
trust
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
in
an
ordinary
trust,
does
it?
i
mean,
as
i
know
of
their
trust,
i
mean
a
conventional
trust.
is
the
--
is
the
trustee's
property
of
pure
trust
or
naked
trust,
if
you
will?
is
that
the
trustee's
property
for
--
for
3670
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
so
we
start
from
there
and
then
the
question
is
whether
the
--
a
state
like
new
york
cannot
create
--
cannot
impose
all
the
interest
and
incidence
of
a
trust
relationship
of
moneys
going
through
of
--
of
person
like
a
contractor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
interested
in
that
particular
question.
that's
--
that's
a
--
a
minor
question
is
referred
to
make
a
redraft
of
arrangements
whether
it
creates
retroacted
community.
but
suppose
you
have
an
outstanding
state
statute
which
governs
by
which
even
just
the
creating.
and
if
one
couldn't
say
that
either
a
device
is
by
the
state,
but
at
least
they're
honest
to
god,
need
of
creating
an
--
a
conventional
trust
relationship.
would
that
be
--
the
question
would
be
where
this
property
under
3670.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
either
to
conceive,
i
don't
know
what
--
i
don't
quite
understand
that
close
opinion.
that's
my
difficulty
or
in
the
language
of
the
minnesota
tax
case,
it's
obscure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
can
get
a
unanimous
court
on
that.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
state
law
preceded
the
lien,
then
the
interest
is
not
antecedent.
and
the
lien
is
not
antecedent
as
the
practical
proposition.
if
the
state
has
fabulous
statute
providing
that
all
these
moneys
should
go
to
the
farmers'
loan
and
trust
company
that
--
or
some
other
trust
company,
would
you
then
say
it
was
just
like
a
lien?
actually,
there
is
a
difference
between
creating
a
lien
and
creating
a
trust.
and
you
don't
have
to
say
that
one
equals
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
the
law
of
property
is
full
of
different
regards
being
reached
for
the
same
result
than
outward
being
reached
by
different
method
that
condemn
even
assignments
and
creation
of
interest.
you
can't
just
wipe
out
and
say
wherever
a
result
is
the
same,
therefore,
all
legal
instrumentalities
are
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
reality
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
a
big
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
of
the
realities
--
these
are
--
the
trust
is
a
very
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
different
thing
from
a
lien.
that's
one
of
the
great
realities
in
which
the
law
has
been
doing
business
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
hundreds
of
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
gilbert
went
that
way,
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
say
there's
no
difference,
i
repeat,
that
there's
no
difference
between
the
creation
of
a
lien
and
the
creation
of
a
bona
fide
trust.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
i
understand
that
too.
