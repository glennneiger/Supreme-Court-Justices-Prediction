mr.
charles
s.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
--
may
it
please
the
court.
for
some
three
days,
this
court
which
have
listened
to
a
contest
between
giants
here,
that
it
listened
to
the
united
states
government
has
one
contest
with
five
different
states
over
property
that
amounts
--
will
eventually
amount
to
billions
of
dollars.
we're
engaged
in
a
contest
here
between
that
--
one
of
those
giants
to
wit,
the
united
states
and
two
small
subcontractors
from
the
state
of
new
york.
the
amount
of
money
involved
is
small.
it's
only
$2200.
the
government
tax
reached
that
far.
it
has
been
awarded
to
them
and
they
claimed
of
it's
--
and
it's
been
awarded
to
them
upon
the
basis
that
it
was
property
of
the
taxpayer
under
3670
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
we
claim
that
the
property
belongs
to
these
subcontractors
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
some
brief
reference
of
the
facts
is
essential.
in
19
--
in
december
1951,
and
again
in
march
of
1952,
the
government
filed
two
assessment
liens
for
small
amounts
with
the
collector
of
internal
revenue
in
albany,
new
york.
that
lien
may
be
--
what
has
been
very
amply
described
as
the
secret
pernicious
lien
of
the
united
states
government
to
wit,
it's
one
of
those
liens
that
nobody,
except
the
united
states
government
and
the
collector
knows
about
it.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
that
may
be
so,
your
honor.
sometime
thereafter,
totally
unaware
of
this
lien
and
totally
unconnected
with
the
tax
--
delinquent
taxpayer,
a
mrs.
bottone
bought
some
rail
property
in
westchester
county.
she
bought
this
property
in
july
of
1942.
some
seven
months
after
the
government
filed
its
first
lien.
she
intended
to
conduct
a
business
thereon
and
have
some
remodeling
work
and
intended
to
have
some
remodeling
work
done.
she
employed
the
delinquent
taxpayer
here,
fleetwood
paving
company,
to
do
that
work.
prior
to
that,
fleetwood
paving
have
no
real
business
relationship
with
her,
nor
with
the
subcontractors,
who
i
represent
the
petitioners
herein.
fleetwood
paving
corporation
thereupon,
entered
into
contracts
with
the
two
petitioners
herein
as
subcontractors,
to
wit,
aquilino
and
colonial
sand
company.
both
these
subcontractors
very
promptly
and
quickly
performed
their
subcontracts
and
completed
their
work.
they
remain
unpaid
to
this
date.
now,
i
mentioned
these
dates
despite
the
fact
that
in
our
opinion,
these
dates
are
unimportant,
unimportant
for
this
reason.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
is
property
of
this
--
of
the
delinquent
taxpayer,
the
general
contractor.
we
say
that
that
isn't.
and
therefore,
the
time
of
filing
by
anybody
is
unimportant.
now,
we
say
it
isn't
because
whether
or
not
this
is
property
of
the
taxpayer
and
therefore,
reachable
by
the
government's
lien,
is
a
matter
purely
of
state
law.
and
this
court
has
so
set
in
the
decision
last
june,
united
states
versus
bess
357
u.s.
51.
therein
--
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
i'd
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
no.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
no.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
i'm
just
getting
to
that.
[laughter]
the
point
is
that
the
government
agrees
as
they've
stated
in
their
brief
on
pages
13
and
7.
petitioner
recognized
as
indeed
they
must
and
then
they
cite
u.s.
versus
bess
that
whether
fleetwood
had
any
property
interest
in
the
sum
due
from
bottone
is
a
question
of
law.
and
on
page
7,
they
set
forth
the
same
recognition
of
that
being
the
question.
now,
it's
regrettable
that
this
bess
case
wasn't
decided
before
the
aquilino
case,
on
which
we
are
here
now.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
your
honor,
we
do
not
consider
that
this
is
a
question
of
competing
liens.
we
only
give
in
to
the
question
of
competing
liens,
if
and
when
you're
discussing
the
question
of
property
that's
admittedly
the
tax
--
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
no.
we
say
there
is
no
question
of
competition.
we
say
that
this
property
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
belongs
to
these
subcontractors.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
i
don't
say
that
we
limit
ourselves
to
that.
i
say
that
all
moneys
due
to
the
general
contractor
including
his
cause
of
action
against
the
owner
for
the
moneys
that
either,
are
due
or
are
to
be
become
due,
are
part
of
the
trust
under
the
new
york
law.
and
as
long
as
they
are
part
of
the
trust
and
these
sub
--
subcontractors
are
the
sole
beneficiaries
of
that
trust,
that
is
not
property
of
the
--
of
the
general
contractor
and
is
not
reachable
by
the
tax
lien.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
that's
right.
it's
just
--
it's
just
as
simple
as
that.
and
we
say
that
it
is
not
the
property
of
the
trustee.
the
--
most
that
could
ever
be
said
with
respect
to
the
trustee
is
that
he
held
bare
legal
title.
he
had
no
beneficial
interest
whatsoever.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
no.
not
the
--
not
the
general
contractor
--
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
well,
the
trustee
--
the
general
contractor
would
be
the
trustee.
but
such
title
as
he
had
would
be
solely
a
bare
legal
title
as
trustee
for
the
benefit
of
the
subcontractors
or
the
beneficiaries
as
set
forth
in
the
statute
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
no.
i
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
that
and
that's
why
the
issue
is
here.we
say
that
the
court
of
appeal
avoided
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not,
this
was
property
of
the
--
of
the
delinquent
taxpayer,
the
general
contractor
herein.
and
we
say
--
and
we
think
it's
crystal
clear
that
they
avoided
it
for
this
reason.
and
i'd
like
to
read
you
a
part
of
their
decision.
it's
in
the
record
on
page
68,
“it
is
by
now
exceedingly
well
settled
that
no
state-created
rule
may
defeat
the
paramount
right
of
the
united
states
to
levy
and
collect
taxes,
uniformly
throughout
the
land.”
with
which
we
agree.
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
“that
being
so,
if
powers
of
the
provisions
on
this
state's
lien
law
to
which
the
responded
points
that
funds
received
by
a
contractor
from
the
owner
for
the
improvement
of
real
property
shall
be
deemed
“trust
funds”
for
the
payment
of
the
subcontractors,
and
then
here's
the
key
line,
“may
not
be
construed
to
affect
the
rights
of
the
government
or
the
priority
of
its
tax
lien.”
now,
i
don't
think
with
that
phraseology,
there
can
be
any
question
that
they
were
deferring
to
the
federal
--
to
federal
decisions,
which
they
cite
as
--
as
precluding
them
from
determining
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
whether
or
not
this
was
property
of
the
general
tax
of
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
that's
exactly
what
we
say
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
our
contention
that
the
court's
own
footnote
to
that
statement
in
their
opinion,
eliminates
and
accentuates
that
very
question
because
in
their
footnote
to
that
statement,
they
say,
“to
the
extent
that
cranford-leopold,
which
was
a
court
of
appeals'
decision
earlier,
just
contrary
to
what
it's
contented
they
held
here,
to
the
extent
that
cranford-leopold
suggest
the
contrary,
it
must
give
way
to
more
recent
federal
decisions.
now,
we
think
that
its
--
that
makes
it
very
clear
that
they
did
not
pass
on
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
this
was
property
of
the
general
--
of
the
general
contractor
under
new
york
state
law.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
that
would
--
that
would
be
an
alternative
disposition,
justice
frankfurter,
but
--
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
well,
we
think
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
decide
what
new
york
law
and
--
is
and
could
therefore,
reverse
it
rather
than
remand
for
--
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
that
may
be
so.
of
course,
we
contend
--
we
contend
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
--
we
contend
exactly
as
was
stated
in
the
opinion
in
the
durham
case,
which
is
to
be
heard
immediately
following
us.
in
the
durham
case
there,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
--
fourth
circuit
there,
i
don't
have
that
phraseology
immediately
at
hand,
but
they
--
but
they
said,
“that
had
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
aquilino
case,
given
further
consideration
or
given
proper
consideration
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
they
probably
would've
disposed
of
it
definitely.”
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
justice
harlan,
i'm
very
--
i'm
very
happy
that
you
--
that
you've
drawn
attention
of
that
for
this
reason.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
this
is
the
reference
that
the
government
makes
to
the
fact
that
--
they
--
they
claim
that
the
government's
lien
attached
to
the
contractual
obligation
of
the
owner
to
the
general
contractor
and
not
for
the
real
property.
and
i
think
that
that's
immaterial,
but
in
order
to
--
let's
see
how
the
government
gets
away
from
that
--
supports
that
question.
they
say
--
they
say
that
two
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
wit,
a
so-called
raymond
case,
288
n.y.
452
and
a
sulphur
case,
290
n.y.
903
held
that
the
contractual
obligation
of
an
owner
to
a
general
contractor
was
--
was
property
of
the
general
contractor
was
that
and
could
therefore,
be
reached
by
judgment
creditors
or
federal
government
lien
or
whatnot.
the
fact
remains
that
those
decisions
may
have,
despite
the
fact
that
i
disagree
with
it,
they
may
have
been
good
law
because
--
but
they
were
based
and
founded
on
a
--
upon
a
construction
of
the
law
prior
to
the
1942
amendment,
which
amendment
--
which
amendment
included
the
contractual
obligation
as
part
of
the
trust.
so
that
--
i
--
i'm
quite
surprised
that
those
two
cases
have
been
cited
by
the
government
here,
because
they
have
attention
withdrawn
to
them.
they
were
criticized
and
they
were
explained
in
a
dissenting
opinion
in
the
gramatan-koslow
case
just
the
year,
1957.
and
it's
very
obvious
that
they
don't
apply
at
all.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
no,
i
--
i
don't
see
it
that
way,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
appreciated
that
they
had
the
right
to
dispose
of
this
on
a
basis
of
what
the
state
law
was.
they
were
under
the
impression
that
they
were
precluded
from
determining
that.
and
the
--
the
strange
part
of
it
is
that
another
case
in
which
this
court
has
just
granted
cert
in
a
--
the
so-called
coblentz
case.
they
decided
on
the
basis
of
this
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
an
attorney's
lien
under
the
judiciary
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
did
constitute
property
of
coblentz,
the
attorney
and
wasn't
--
and
was
superior
to
the
lien
of
the
government.
so,
now,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
property
of
the
--
whose
property
this
is
against
which
the
government
has
filed
the
lien
or
claim
the
lien?
let's
look
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
both
the
legislative
and
judicial
history
of
that
law.
i
happen
to
have
been
practicing
prior
to
--
in
new
york
prior
to
the
time
that
this
law
was
passed
in
1929.
prior
to
that
time,
there
was
nothing
to
stop
a
general
contractor
from
performing
a
contract
with
an
owner,
collecting
all
the
money
that
was
due
and
then
absconding,
leaving
the
subcontractors
and
the
materialmen
high
and
dry.
we
finally
got
pretty
fed
up
with
that
situation
and
amend
the
lien
law
so
as
to
provide
that
a
contractor
who
collected
money
from
an
owner
or
an
owner
who
collected
money
from
a
mortgagee
--
from
a
mortgagee
and
who
did
not
use
the
moneys
for
the
purpose
of
paying
subcontractors
and
materialmen,
was
guilty
of
a
diversion
and
guilty
of
a
crime.
i'll
put
a
stop
to
a
great
deal
of
it,
but
then
as
usual,
they
found
ways
and
means
of
avoiding
that
and
so
we
have
continuously
amended
the
law
right
down
to
date,
so
that
we
believe
that
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
there
was
a
complete
valid
trust
for
the
benefit
of
subcontractors,
materialmen
and
the
few
others
mentioned
of
the
statute.
now,
with
respect
to
the
elements
of
this
trust,
first
of
all,
it
identifies
the
trust
assets,
and
i'm
reading
from
the
statute
now.
it
says
that
the
funds
received
by
a
contractor
from
an
owner,
from
an
owner
for
the
improvement
of
real
property.
so
we
have
no
question
as
to
the
identification
of
the
corpus
of
the
trust.
then
it
designates
a
place
of
beneficiaries
and
it
specifically
says
subcontractors,
laborers,
materialmen
and
it
list
others.
then
it
designates
the
trustee
and
it
says,
“that
the
funds
constituting
this
trust
shall
--
are
hereby
declared
to
be
trust
funds
in
the
hands
of
such
contractor.”
so
we
now
have
a
trustee.
other
sections
of
the
statute
which
we
inadvertently
did
not
have
pointed,
specifically
requires
them
to
keep
books
and
records
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statute
very
elaborately
says
why
he
shall
keep
in
the
books
and
records
and
how
he
shall
keep
that.
it
requires
him
to
furnish
an
accounting
to
anyone
of
the
beneficiaries
of
this
trust
anytime
upon
10
days
notice.
now,
it
has
--
it
--
it
also
authorizes
any
beneficiary
to
examine
the
books
and
records,
to
examine
checkbooks,
any
of
the
ledger
accounts,
specifically
set
forth
in
the
statute.
so
that
we
have
every
single
essential
element
of
a
vital
trust
in
this
situation.
now
--
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
i
say
that
that,
your
honor,
at
the
misconstruction
of
the
new
york
statute
because
the
new
york
statute
specifically
says
that
that
property
is
part
of
the
trust
here.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
whether
it
is
personal
property
or
not,
it's
still
part
of
the
corpus
of
this
trust
for
the
benefit
--
benefit
of
these
beneficiaries
and
it's
therefore,
not
reachable
by
the
government,
if
it
isn't
the
taxpayer's
property,
if
it
isn't
the
delinquent
taxpayer's
property,
whether
it's
personal
property,
whether
real
property,
whether
it's
a
hybrid.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
no.
but
then
we
come
to
the
1942
amendment,
your
honor.
and
that
1942
amendment
specifically
says
that
for
the
purposes
of
any
action,
“the
trust
fund
shall
include
the
right
of
action
upon
an
obligation
for
moneys
due
or
to
become
due
to
a
contractor,
as
well
as
money
actually
received
by
him.”
so
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
so-called
contractual
obligation
referred
to
in
--
in
what
you
have
just
read,
is
part
and
partial
of
the
trust
for
the
benefit
of
these
beneficiaries.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
frankly.
frankly
--
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
--
your
honor,
we're
--
we're
somewhat
puzzled
as
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
are
trying
to
say.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
somewhat
puzzled
and
we're
--
we're
more
convinced
to
that
in
reading
two
subsequent
decisions
of
theirs
in
which
they
have
circumvented
this
very
--
this
very
question.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
yes.
they're
trying
to
define
--
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
--
they're
trying
to
define
property
not
according
to
the
state
law,
but
according
to
the
--
according
to
federal
law
which
we
say
is
wrong.
we
say
that
this
property,
this
--
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
that's
right.
now
--
now,
there
is
one
single
decision
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
which
this
trust
has
been
denied
full
force
and
effect
as
a
good
and
valid
trust.
there
was
also
--
i
also
direct
your
attention
to
the
--
to
some
of
the
federal
cases
involved
here,
particularly,
those
in
bankruptcy,
one
case
to
which
boiler
versus
godfrey
121
f.
--
f.2d
415
in
which
this
court
314
u.s.
denied
cert.
the
question
arose
there
as
to
where
or
not
the
property
of
a
--
whether
or
not
funds
receivable
by
a
bankrupt
in
connection
with
work
performed
under
this
same
lien
law,
whether
or
not
they
were
reachable
by
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
for
the
benefit
of
general
creditors
and
the
court
held
that
they
were
not.
they
were
not
reachable
under
--
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
trustee
had
no
title
to
them
they
had
no
right
to
them.
so
that
we
have
a
good
and
valid
trustee
here
and
we
have
the
court
of
appeals
not
determining
what
the
subcontractors'
rights
were
hereunder.
thus,
the
legislature
of
the
--
of
the
state
of
new
york
by
statute
and
the
judiciary
of
the
state
of
new
york
have
held
by
their
decisions
that
--
and
are
not
accepting
aquilino
that
this
is
a
good
and
valid
trust.
and
that
the
only
persons
that
have
any
right
title
or
interest
are
the
beneficiaries
set
forth
in
the
statute.
now,
this
brings
us
to
one
unusual
situation.
the
government,
in
its
brief,
accedes
to
the
fact
that
private
individuals
can
avoid
the
consequences
of
this
act.
on
page
22
in
their
brief,
in
commenting
upon
the
decision
of
(inaudible)
in
the
second
circuit
which
this
court
cited
with
approval
in
u.s.-bess,
they
said
that
for
assuming
the
correctness
of
(inaudible)
it
is
not
unusual
that
parties
by
contract
may
change
their
respective
rights.
now,
would
be
anomalous
to
say
the
least,
that
parties
to
a
contract
could
--
could
prevent
the
united
states
government
from
collecting
taxes
against
to
delinquent
taxpayer
by
putting
the
proper
clause
in
a
contract,
but
that
the
state
of
new
york
with
its
sovereign
power
and
through
his
judiciary,
cannot
protect
the
subcontractor
from
the
government
coming
in
and
taking
its
moneys
as
they
have
here.
i
say
that
this
is
not
property
of
the
delinquent
taxpayer.
it's
solely
the
property
of
the
subcontractors
here
not
reachable
by
the
federal
government's
lien
under
3670
and
that
there
should
be
either
a
reversal
or
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
further
consideration
on
the
basis
of
new
york
state
law.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
i
say
that
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
yes.
i
say
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
do
that
within
certain
limitation.
it
cannot,
of
course,
be
obvious
that
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
defeat
the
united
states
government
in
any
respect.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
no.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
i
--
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it's
a
--
it's
a
question
of
the
label
that
you
put
on
it.
i
say
that
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
it's
very
clear
that
this
is
a
good
and
valid
trust.
they
have
gone
to
extreme
lengths
to
define
the
trust,
the
nature
of
it,
the
trust
assets,
the
beneficiary,
they've
imposed
criminal
sanctions,
civil
sanctions.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
that's
right.
that's
exactly
what
we
contend
and
that
this
--
and
that
this
general
contractor
has
no
right
title
or
interest
there
except
there
legal
title
for
the
benefit
of
the
beneficiaries,
if
and
when,
the
money
comes
into
his
hands.
mr.
charles
s.
friedman
that's
right.
they
say,
“we
have
no
right
to
consider
whether
or
not
as
property
of
the
general
contractor.”
thank
you,
your
honor.
