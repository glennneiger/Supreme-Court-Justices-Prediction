it
involves
some
appraisal
about
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
the
--
if
the
court
thought
that
the
claim
--
which
are
not
suggesting
for
a
moment,
was
a
flimflam
claim,
it
would
a
bearing
and
whether
you
got
issue
in
a
temporary
injunction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
the
kind
of
weighing
that
would
influence
the
determination
of
the
adjustment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that's
your
--
that's
your
point.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
present
situation,
mr.
heiss?
did
this
court
of
appeals
give
you
a
stay
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
of
this
mandate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
happened
as
a
practical
matter,
is
your
people
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
staying
at
their
locations?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
the
case
moot?
that's
what
i'm
getting
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
understand
it,
reached
only
the
question
of
power
and
they
didn't
reach
the
question
of
whether
this
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
assuming
there
was
power,
is
that
right?
