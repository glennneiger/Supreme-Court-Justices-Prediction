mr.
harold
c.
heiss
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
if
the
court
please.
the
petitioners
here
are
four
railway
labor
organizations
in
the
operating
group.
the
respondents,
plaintiffs
in
the
district
court,
are
two
railroad
companies
which
sought
and
obtained
an
injunction
against
the
strike
by
the
operating
employees
of
the
two
railroad
companies.
the
cause
is
before
your
honors
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
through
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit.
and
review
by
this
court
is
limited
to
a
single
question
which
is
spelled
out
on
the
second
page
of
petitioners'
brief
on
the
merits,
the
blue-covered
document
on
the
bench.
the
cause
involves
a
decision
of
this
court
rendered
about
three
years
ago,
known
in
railroad
parlance
as
the
chicago
river
case.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
the
cause
involves
--
the
cause
involves
a
decision
of
this
court
rendered
about
three
years
ago,
known
as
the
chicago
river
case,
wherein
this
court
held
that
an
injunction
may
lie
against
railroad
employees
who
seek
to
promote
a
strike
to
enforce
payment
of
demands
of
some
character
which
may
be
pending
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
a
tribunal
established
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
having
the
authority
and
power
to
interpret
agreements
made
under
the
act
between
employees
and
railroad
companies.
in
granting
the
strike
injunction
in
this
cause,
the
district
judge
imposed
certain
conditions
upon
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
which
were
protective
of
the
interest
of
the
employees,
the
defendants,
and
protective
of
the
interest
of
the
public.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
strike
injunction,
but
excised
from
the
order
of
the
district
court,
the
conditions
deemed
to
be
protective
of
the
interest
of
the
other
litigants
and
the
public.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
no,
your
honor.
the
injunction
was
issued
in
only
one
form,
on
--
on
december
18,
but
later
on,
to
wit,
on
january
5,
1959,
in
denying
a
motion
for
a
stay
as
by
the
railroad
company,
the
district
judge
in
that
order
denying
the
stay
explained
what
he
meant
in
some
detail
when
he
issued
the
original
order
to
wit,
that
he
intended
that
the
conditions
imposed
upon
the
railroad
company,
protective
of
the
interest
of
the
employees
were
conditions
upon
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
and
were
not
a
mandatory
order
directed
against
the
railroad
company.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes.
i
think
it
would
be
susceptible
of
that
interpretation,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes.
yes,
precisely
so,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
don't
think
it's
any
different,
take
--
except
that
i
think
this,
your
honor,
that
i
--
i
don't
mean
it's
any
different
to
this
extent.
i
think
there
is
only
a
conditioning
of
the
issuance
of
the
injunction.
but
i
--
i
think
we
might
get
into
some
other
ancillary
legal
propositions
if
we
were
to
regard
this
as
a
--
as
a
mandatory
injunction
of
a
preliminary
nature
in
which
event,
we
might
get
into
the
area
of
determining
whether
a
bond
should
be
required,
for
example.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
insofar
as
the
practical
consequences
are
pictured.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
think
you're
right,
your
honor,
in
that
respect.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
it
couldn't
possibly,
in
this
case,
have
involved
the
condition
a
--
a
decision
on
the
merits,
your
honor.
the
--
the
--
i
think
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
little
bit,
but
the
district
court
expressly
disclaimed
any
intention
of
deciding
on
a
--
deciding
the
matter
on
the
merits
and
a
study
of
this
record
will
reveal
that
there
was
no
decision
on
the
merits
and
you
can't
possibly
read
into
any
of
the
orders
of
the
district
court,
a
view
either
way
on
the
merits.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes,
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
now,
to
us,
this
review
involves
the
somewhat
startling
proposition
which
was
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
a
court
of
equity,
while
issuing
an
injunction
against
the
strike
of
railroad
employees,
is
without
power
to
further
exercise
its
equitable
jurisdiction,
to
impose
conditions
protective
of
the
interest
of
the
employees
against
whom
the
injunction
was
issued
and
the
public
which
has
an
interest
in
the
settlement
of
labor
disputes.
now,
i
think,
your
honors
can
best
appraise
and
understand
the
question
involved
in
the
cause,
in
the
context
of
the
facts,
which
i
think
i
can
state
to
you
in
brief
compass.
for
25
years,
there
were
in
effect,
on
the
respondent
railroads,
intradivisional
runs
between
the
points
of
wichita
falls,
texas,
and
forgan,
oklahoma.
there
were
five
terminals
which
are
illustrated
by
the
fingers
on
my
hand.
two
runs
ran
from
wichita
falls
to
a
place
named
altus,
one
run
from
altus
to
elk
city,
one
from
elk
city
to
woodward
and
one
from
woodward
to
forgan.
those
runs
had
been
established
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
entered
in
--
into
by
the
employees,
which
provided
also
that
the
runs
that
had
been
established
and
the
terminals
through
which
they
ran
could
not
be
changed
without
notice
given
under
the
agreements
and
without
notice
or
without
notice
given
under
the
railway
labor
act.
these
agreements
were
--
were
negotiated
by
the
employees
to
prevent
an
arbitrary
and
unilateral
action
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
companies
to
change
these
--
just
these
runs.
now,
in
violation
of
the
agreements,
on
october
2nd,
1958,
the
carriers
issued
two
general
orders
that
new
interdivisional
runs
would
be
established
and
that
certain
home
and
away-from-home
terminals
would
be
abolished.
the
employees
asked
that
the
orders
be
cancelled.
they
asserted
that
the
action
of
the
respondents
was
contrary
to
the
railway
labor
act
and
contrary
to
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
when
the
carriers
refused
to
cancel
their
notices,
the
employees
invoked
the
services
of
the
national
mediation
board
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
national
mediation
board
took
jurisdiction
of
the
dispute,
the
respondents
put
the
general
orders
into
effect
on
october
19,
1958,
approximately
two
weeks
and
a
half
after
the
orders
were
issued.
now,
the
orders
have
this
effect
upon
the
employees
whom
i
represent
here.
two
terminals
were
abolished
this
one
and
this
one.home
and
away-from-home
terminals.
the
runs
were
made
to
run
from
wichita
falls
to
elk
city
and
from
elk
city
to
forgan,
oklahoma.
the
man
who
lived
here
and
the
man
who
lived
here,
were
obliged
either
to
travel
to
this
point
or
this
point,
to
perform
their
work
or
to
move
their
homes
from
the
same
places
to
distant
points.
an
uprooting
of
their
homes,
a
dissolution
of
family,
social
and
religious
ties
were
entailed
by
the
--
by
the
general
orders
issued
by
these
railroad
companies.
in
addition,
the
employees
who
have
these
two
places,
as
away-from-home
terminals,
had
their
way
from
home
terminals
changed
and
modified
and
they
were
obliged
to
solicit
and
seek
new
porters
living
away-from-home
for
their
turnaround
runs
and
finding
new
places
to
eat
and
all
of
the
dislocations
would
go
to
a
traveling
man,
when
he
finds
that
his
place
of
--
of
performing
his
work
has
been
changed
to
another
location.
in
addition
to
that,
10
employees
were
immediately
furloughed
by
the
action
of
the
carrier
in
issuing
these
general
orders.
the
number
of
crews
that
had
been
operating
between
these
points
was
reduced
from
five
to
three.
now,
their
submissions
made
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
which
had
not
been
made
at
this
time,
but
which
come
into
the
case
at
a
later
point,
do
not
involve
anything
other
than
a
--
a
request
for
disposition
by
the
adjustment
board
of
the
question
of
whether
the
agreements
have
been
violated.
they
do
not
involve
the
question
of
whether
these
employees
are
entitled
to
any
compensation
or
paid
for
time
lost.
now,
obviously,
no
payment
in
money,
whatever
compensate
these
men
for
the
time
that
they
must
spend
in
travelling
from
their
home
terminals
to
new
places
to
report
for
work,
for
seeking
for
the
hardships
and
the
burdens
that
they
endure
in
moving
their
homes,
severing
their
social
and
family
and
religious
ties,
and
in
seeking
new
places
to
sleep
and
new
places
to
eat
at
newly
established
way
from
--
away-from-home
terminals.
i
emphasized
to
you,
if
your
honors
please,
that
nothing
that
the
adjustment
board
can
do
--
can
possibly
compensate
my
clients
for
the
hardships
imposed
upon
them
by
the
general
orders
of
the
railroad
companies.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
the
--
the
adjustment
board
has
just
one
thing
that
the
railroad
company
its
--
and
its
--
in
its
submission
has
asked
the
board
to
decide.
and
that
is
whether
the
terms
of
the
collective
agreements,
prohibit
the
railroad
company
from
issuing
these
general
orders
and
making
changes
in
the
interdivisional
runs
and
of
the
terminals.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
that
the
railroad
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
the
practical
consequences
are
that
the
general
orders
would
remain
in
effect
as
they
are
now
and
these
runs
would
be
changed
as
the
general
orders
contemplate.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes.all
of
the
dislocations
that
are
presently
taken
place
would
be
--
would
be
continued
if
the
decision
of
the
adjustment
board
should
be
in
favor
of
the
railroad
companies
and
against
us.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
that's
it.
that's
it,
your
honor.
to
ward
off
the
hardships
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
--
i'm
coming
to
that
and
i'd
just
as
soon
answered,
no.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
just
hope
that
i
will
have
an
opportunity
to
get
to
it
and
i'm
going
to
make
every
effort
to
do
it.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
oh,
it
is
crucial
and
i
must
get
to
it,
your
honor.
now,
when
the
--
when
the
employees
went
on
strike
on
november
6,
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued.
on
a
hearing
on
the
preliminary
injunction
which
took
place
in
december
of
1958,
judge
davidson,
the
--
district
judge
as
i've
told
the
court
before,
issued
the
strike
injunction,
but
imposed
upon
it
the
conditions
that
the
status
quo
ante,
the
status
quo
which
existed
so
far
as
working
conditions
were
concerned
which,
as
i
say,
existed
before
the
issuance
of
the
general
orders
should
be
restored
or
in
lieu
thereof
or
an
alternative,
if
the
railroad
company
elected.
the
carrier
might
choose
to
pay
the
employees
for
their
losses.
now,
on
december
10,
which
was
just
about
a
week
before
the
hearing
on
the
preliminary
injunction,
the
carrier
had
elected
to
submit
this
matter
to
the
adjustment
board
and
to
another
--
a
number
of
other
disputes,
committees,
and
national
committees,
which
submissions
are
not
involved
in
this
case
inasmuch
as
the
review
is
limited
only
to
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
as
a
result
of
the
chicago
river
decision.
now,
the
district
judge
apparently
regarded
the
chicago
river
case
as
requiring
the
issuance
of
this
preliminary
injunction
despite
the
belated
recourse
to
the
board,
but
he
did
not
regard
the
case
as
prohibiting
his
exercising
the
traditional
powers
of
a
chancellor
to
protect
all
the
litigants
as
well
as
the
public
in
the
injunction
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
regarded
the
chicago
river
case
apparently
as
requiring
the
issuance
of
the
--
in
strike
injunction
and
as
prohibiting
the
imposition
of
any
protective
conditions.
because
it
said
that
such
conditions
would
involve
and
i
quote,
“passing
a
preliminary
judgment
upon
the
merits
of
the
--
of
the
disputes
committed
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
board.”
now,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
imposition
of
the
condition
does
not
involved
passing
upon
the
merits
of
the
contentions
between
the
parties.
certainly
it
doesn't
involve
passing
upon
merits
of
the
contention
between
the
parties
in
this
case,
any
more
than
it
does
in
any
other
case
where
a
preliminary
injunction
or
a
temporary
restraining
order
is
under
consideration
by
the
court.
and
this
court
has
frequently
in
cases
in
the
past
not
--
not
those
arising
under
the
railway
labor
act,
but
in
other
causes
coming
before
the
court
held
that
it
is
proper
in
issuing
an
injunction
to
establish
and
attach
certain
other
conditions
which
would
be
protective
of
the
defendants
against
whom
the
injunction
ran.
and
i
--
i
say
that
that
is
just
a
normal
exercise
of
the
equitable
powers
of
the
chancellor
and
it
has
been
frequently
held
by
according
to
my
understanding
that
the
rulings
upon
temporary
restraining
orders
are
not
--
and
preliminary
injunctions
do
not
involve
a
--
a
--
an
indication
necessarily
of
the
ultimate
disposition
to
--
to
evade
by
the
court
of
the
controversy.
and
the
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
it
necessarily
involves
some
appraisal
somewhere
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
--
i
can
see
it,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
it
does
allow
some
weighing.
one
must
necessarily
in
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
that's
precisely
it.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
that's
precisely
it.
and
the
district
judge
plainly
and
clearly
stopped
short
of
entering
such
an
order
as
would
influence
the
adjustment
board
or
which
would
be
binding
upon
the
adjustment
for
it.
but
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
but
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes,
that's
precisely
it.
that's
a
much
better
statement
than
i
could
have
made
of
it,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
and
i
appreciate
the
statement
of
it
in
that
fashion.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
but
i
--
i
--
whether
that
is
what
he
meant
or
not,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
--
it's
the
practical
effect
of
--
of
what
--
of
what
judge
reeves
said.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
the
procedure
that
we
--
that
--
that
was
adopted
by
judge
davidson,
the
district
court,
in
this
case,
permits
the
work
of
the
adjustment
board
to
have
full
play.
but
it
didn't
--
in
the
meantime,
it
protects
the
employees
against
arbitrary
and
unilateral
rapacious
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
carriers
which
may
sweep
aside
the
--
all
the
rights
of
the
employees
in
the
meantime
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes,
yes.
this
contract
maybe
held
good
and
by
the
time
the
adjustment
board
gets
around
to
decide
this
dispute,
four,
five,
six
or
seven
years
from
now,
they
may
have
well
have
worn
down
these
employees
to
the
point
where
they
have
no
longer
any
voice
in
the
situation.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
well,
may
i
suggest,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
--
the
justice
delayed
is
often
not
justice
at
all.
and
we're
dealing
here
with
working
men
who
would
depend
upon
the
--
results
of
their
daily
labors
to
eat
and
to
maintain
their
families
and
may
not
--
may
not
the
chancellor
take
that
into
account
among
other
factors
in
--
in
weighing
what
his
decision
is.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
judge
davidson
did
so.
because
there
are
no
findings
and
there
are
no
preference
to
it
in
the
order.
but
may
i
suggest
to
it
that
if
i
see
a
problem?
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
don't
think
they
can
do
anything
else.
their
powers
are
limited
to
the
interpretation
of
the
agreement
which
would
amount
to
a
declaration
or
declaratory
judgment
and
that
would
end
the
matter
so
far
as
the
adjustment
board
is
concerned.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
what?
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
what
relief,
have
the
employees?
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
if
they
are
sustained,
they
probably
could
--
could
sue
for
back
pay
or
to
institute
another
proceeding
for
the
adjustment
board.
we
--
and
i
suppose
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
for
claims,
yes.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
because
it's
not
--
it
was
not
submitted
by
the
railroad
--
by
the
railroads
to
the
adjustment
board
as
an
issue.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
the
men
haven't
made
a
counter
claim
and
i
don't
know
whether
they
can.
but
let
--
let
us
not
forget
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
--
i
am
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
they
could,
provided
that
they
--
that
a
time
limit
on
claims
provision
is
not
in
the
contracts
of
the
missouri-kansas-texas
railroad,
in
which
the
circumstances
he
claims
could
not
be
filed
at
the
present
time,
because
at
the
time
that
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
that's
right.
i
was
about
to
suggest
that
again,
mr.
justice
whitaker,
that
the
uprooting
of
these,
before
the
requirement
to
move
their
homes
to
travel
longer
distances
and
all
of
these
things
cannot
possibly
be
compensated
for,
in
terms
of
money,
or
by
any
proceeding
before
the
adjustment
board
or
by
any
order
that
that
board
could
make.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
--
i
think
there
is
entailed
in
practically
every
order
that
is
issued
by
way
of
an
injunction.
some
hardships
upon
the
other
side
and
we
are
enjoined
from
striking
which
is
a
hardship
against
us
and
the
railroad
company
according
to
judge
davidson
--
davidson's
order,
he's
ordered
to
--
to
restore
the
status
quo
ante
which
--
for
all
the
time
that
the
injunction
is
in
effect,
maybe
some
sort
of
a
burden
upon
the
railroad
company.
but
they
are
the
folks
who
were
elected
to
draw
to
the
adjustment
board
and
submit
the
case
to
that
tribunal
and
they
didn't
have
to
do
it.
they
could've
settled
the
matter
with
us
in
conference.
there
was
a
remedy
available
to
them.
but
they
elected
to
go
to
the
adjustment
board
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
must
take
the
consequences
of
that.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
they
were
not
even
initiated
by
the
railroad
companies,
your
honor.
the
--
these
contracts
provide
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
no,
but
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
understand,
your
honor.
the
contracts
provide
that
a
railroad
company
desiring
to
establish
interdivisional
runs
in
order
to
--
to
change
these
terminals
must
give
notice
to
the
employees
of
the
--
their
intention
to
do
so.
they
didn't
give
that
notice.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
it
did
not.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
it
did
not.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
some
are
living
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
--
at
the
abolished
terminals
and
going
to
the
new
terminals
to
go
to
work.
others
have
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
oh,
it
is
not.
it
is
not.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
no,
your
honor.
there
is
a
case
which
--
pending
before
this
court
on
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
is
number
535
and
comes
from
this
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
which
involved
the
imposition
by
the
district
judge
of
a
--
of
a
condition
that
while
the
strike
injunction
was
in
effect,
that
certain
operators
of
tugs
in
new
york
harbor
be
retained
in
--
in
service.
on
appeal,
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
by
a
2
to
1
decision,
sustained
the
injunction,
but
set
aside
the
conditions
on
--
when
advised
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes,
it's
in
accord
with
the
fifth
circuit
and
just
one
further
statement
in
answer
to
--
to
your
question.
while
the
matter
is
here
on
the
petition
for
a
certiorari
and
the
united
rail
--
railroad
workers
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
has
stayed
its
mandate.
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
tugboat
workers
in
new
york
are
presently
on
the
job
as
the
result
of
the
district
court's
order.
i
am
grateful
to
the
court
for
the
privilege
of
having
appeared
before
you
today.
