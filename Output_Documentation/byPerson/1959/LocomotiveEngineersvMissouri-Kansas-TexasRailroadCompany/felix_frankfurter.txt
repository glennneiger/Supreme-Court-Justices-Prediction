the
fifth
congress
of
the

has
been
a
constitutional

having
before

and
one
has
a
brief
study
and
would
say
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
awkwardness
in
(inaudible)
in
that
situation.but
after
that,
i
don't
know
if
we
could
take

into
account
in
determining
whether
the

that
maybe

suppose
the

decides
in
your

and
it
deploys
that
decision,
it

so
why

justice

and
that

is
contrary
to
your
license?
justice

(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice

but
they
could
start
in

they
could
initiate
a
proceeding
for
the
adjustment
board
for
monetary
claims
which
is
granted
and
then
bring
forth
from
a
judgment
by
the
adjustment
board,
isn't
that
right?
justice

and
not
many
of
them.

board,
what
about
(inaudible)
justice

(voice

what
the

(inaudible)
justice

do
you
think
committees
are
between

are
constituted
by
representatives
of
the
railroad
companies?
justice

and
you
say
they
dismissed
these
claims?
justice

wouldn't
that
be
four
years?
justice
felix

(inaudible)
justice
felix

that
--
let's
if
i
understand
you.
as
i
understood
you,
you
suggested
judge

examined
it,
judge
davidson.
did
he
enjoin

didn't
he
provided
the
statute
(inaudible)
i
am
making
or
having
reduced
these
men
in
their
old
position
pending
the
determination,
by
rejection
of
the
board
but
it
merely
wanted
to
procure
the
payment
for
them,
the
wages
they
would
have
had,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
understand
why
turning
the
money
in
escrow
was
just
(inaudible)
who
i
finally,
i'd
ask
them,
did
you
take
of
the
problem?
justice

frankfurter
what
page
you're
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
where
do
this
indicate
that
they
thought
it
wasn't?
justice
felix

i
suppose
that

some
kind
of
a

there's
some
kind
of
a

there's
some
kind
of
the
view
about

merits.
justice
felix

mr.
clinton,
what
is
then
--
what
is
meant
at
the
court,
the
statement
had
only
10
mailer
involved
and
basically
(inaudible)
drawing
that
order
and
while
they're
protesting
it,
this
agreement
rather,
there
was
the
3000
men
will
be
great
to
resist
the
motive
by
what
is
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
clinton,
may
i
ask
you
whether
you
think
that
any

has
discretion
(inaudible)
granting
of

injunction
that
you
--
unless
you're

you're
indictable
in
the
district
court.
