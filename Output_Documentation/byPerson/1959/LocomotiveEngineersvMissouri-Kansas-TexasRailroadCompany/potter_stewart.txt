how
many
in
the
crew?
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
mr.
clinton,
this
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
issue
now
before
the
adjustment
board.
justice
potter
stewart
each
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
must
say
--
mr.
clinton,
the
record
though
indicates,
doesn't
it,
that
the
district
judge
had
a
--
had
an
inaccurate
idea
of
how
fast
these
matters
are
processed
by
the
adjustment
board,
because
as
i
read
it
here,
didn't
he
say
that
if
the
railroad
adjustment
board
cannot
act
in
30
days,
you
can
come
back
with
a
further
motion.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
did
you
go
back
within
30
days
or
--
or
i
not
exactly
30
days?
justice
potter
stewart
one
thing
of
course,
to
--
(inaudible)
injunction,
if
the
matter
is
going
to
be
resolved
in
a
few
days
or
weeks
in
quote
another,
perhaps,
not
only
in
agreement
in
kind,
the
condition
on
injunction,
that's
the
ultimate
resolution,
isn't
going
to
occur
for
five
or
six
years.
justice
potter
stewart
no
idead
and
i
misread
the
--
this
record
or
is
there
something
i
don't
see,
didn't
the
district
judge
indicate
he
had
an
idea
that
this
matter
would
be
resolved
in
30
days
