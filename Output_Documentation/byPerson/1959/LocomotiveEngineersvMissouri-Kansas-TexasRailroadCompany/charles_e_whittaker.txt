in
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
other
words,
all
the
district
court
would
determine
here
with
--
with
whether
a
claim
was
not
colorable
merely.
if
--
if
it
were
not,
then
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
somewhere
else.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
okay.
and
as
i
understand
it,
what
he
did
here,
if
you
still
listen,
was
merely
to
assume
that
the
contract
he
brought,
but
he
couldn't
assume
to
be
bad
and
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
say
what
they've
meant
was
in
the
railway
--
railway
adjustment
board
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
and
therefore,
to
put
the
--
this,
the
old
machinery,
in
status
quo
ante
to
determine
and
let
the
board
determine
and
give
a
fact
to
whatever
its
conclusion
really
was.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
if
not
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
under
a
contract
that
maybe
held
good.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
--
and
i
suggest
perhaps
possibly
if,
but
only
if
full
redress
of
he
contract
was
remediable
at
law.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
as
i
understand
in
this
(inaudible)
that
consists
of
the
elimination
of
two
of
the
five
crews
that
we
bargained
in
this
texas
thing.
