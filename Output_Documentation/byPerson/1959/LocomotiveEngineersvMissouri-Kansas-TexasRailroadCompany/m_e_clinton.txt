mr.
m.
e.
clinton
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
i
would
first
like
to
clear
up
some
erroneous
statements
of
fact,
but
before
getting
to
that,
i
want
to
state
that
a
strike
actually
occurred
on
a
railroad,
without
warning
to
us
at
6
o'clock
on
november
the
6th
--
6
a.m.,
on
november
the
6th,
1958.
our
train
--
and
your
--
the
service
employees
actually
went
on
strike.
it
tied
up
our
railroad
from
st.louis
and
kansas
city
on
the
north
through
oklahoma
city,
dallas
and
fort
worth,
to
houston
and
san
antonio
on
the
south.
it
completely
stopped
all
of
our
line
movements
except
for
a
few
trains
who
--
which
were
permitted
to
go
to
some
sidetrack.
it
stopped
every
bit
of
our
service
to
some
3600
industries
that
we've
served
along.
stopped
our
service
to
about
1300
other
industries
which
we
served
jointly
with
other
people,
1100
of
our
train
service
employees
ran
out
of
service,
so
although
there
were
only
10
people
involved
in
this
particular
matter,
we
were
completely
paralyzed
until
we
filed
our
suit
for
an
injunction
and
got
a
temporary
restraining
order
on
that
day.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
10
people,
your
honor,
the
--
this
draft
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
no,
sir.there
is
only
10
people
involved
in
this
particular
controversy,
10.
if
this
strike
had
not
been
stopped,
we
would've
been
compelled
to
layoff
some
2100
other
people
who
were
not
directly
in
incidentally.
about
83%
of
all
of
our
revenues
are
derived
from
interstate
commerce
and
handling
the
united
states
mail.
i
mentioned
that
to
show
the
interstate
character
of
our
service.
the
organizations
filed
an
answer
to
our
complaint
and
they
set
out
in
this
answer
that
we
had
violated
specific
agreements.
they
alleged
that
we
had
violated
what
is
termed
"schedule
agreements"
which
are
the
agreements
under
which
we
actually
operate.
while
they
set
out
article
10
and
article
11
and
article
59
and
article
60,
they
finally
wind
up
in
this
court.
they're
claiming
only
that
we
violated
subdivisions
(a)
and
(f)
of
article
10
and
article
59.
they
also
alleged
that
we
had
violated
four
so-called
mediation
agreements,
which
were
agreements
negotiated
nationally
and
then
adopted
by
the
different
railroads
on
the
various
properties.
and
they
alleged
that
we
had
violated
the
three
so-called
national
agreements.
one
of
which,
they
now
admit,
is
not
in
existence.
so
they're
here
now
before
you
with
two.
the
so-called
national
agreements
are
the
agreements
which
mr.
heiss
referred
to
as
interdivisional
run
agreements.
i
will
get
to
those
a
little
bit
later.
after
this
answer
was
filed,
we
prepared
submission,
a
submission
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
we
referred
to
that
board
every
claim
to
the
agreement
violation
which
the
organizations
had
alleged
in
their
answer.
and
we
also
are
subject
to
jurisdictional
objections
which
are
set
out
in
each
submission,
made
submissions
to
a
committee
which
was
established
by
the
so-called
national
agreement
committees
which
were
established
by
the
so-called
mediation
agreements
and
to
the
national
mediation
board.
we
wanted
to
be
absolute
--
certain
that
we
had
followed
every
possible
recourse
administratively.
the
national
mediation
board,
as
you
will
find
in
appendix
to
our
brief,
has
said,
"that
in
effect,
that
the
case
is
properly
sent
to
the
adjustment
board
and
to
these
other
committees."
and
therefore,
they
have
sort
of
washed
their
hands
of
it.
you'll
also
find
that
three
of
these
so-called
disputes
committees
which
grew
out
of
mediation
agreements,
have
dismissed
the
cases,
as
we
thought
they
should
do.
two
of
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
yes,
sir.
they
are.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
three
of
them
did
--
dismissed
the
claims.
two
of
them
set
outright
that
they
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
the
other
one
said
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
because
it
had
been
submitted
to
one
of
these
national
committees
which
of
course
is
an
error
because
we
couldn't
submit
that
issue
to
that
particular
committee.
now,
the
--
the
organizations
have
filed
their
answer
before
the
adjustment
board
and
we
have
filed
our
reply
to
that
answer
before
the
adjustment
board.
so,
the
matter
is
pending
there
whenever
the
board
gets
around
to
it.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
i
don't
know,
sir.
if
it
is
four
years
and
we
have
to
comply
with
this
order,
we
will
have
paid
out
$140,000
for
which
we
have
no
--
no
bond
or
anything
else.
it's
$35,000
a
year
according
to
our
testimony
which
you
find
on
page
302
of
the
record
at
the
top
of
the
page.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
yes,
sir.
and
i'm
not
surprised
this
--
not
more.
i
was
really
surprised
this
morning
when
i
looked
it
over,
because
i
think
it
runs
higher
than
that,
but
that's
what
the
record
shows.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
yes,
sir.
that's
what
it
is.
and
if
i
may,
i'll
get
to
the
facts
a
little
bit
later,
or
i'll
stop
and
now
and
get
to
the
facts.
if
you
wish
to
look
at
the
map,
you'll
find
it
at
page
79
of
the
record
and
you'll
find
that
this
area
we're
talking
about
is
from
wichita
falls,
texas
and
the
parallel
in
green
line,
i
believe,
is
beside
the
red
line,
wichita
falls,
texas
up
to
forgan,
oklahoma,
a
distance
of
302
miles.
we
have
five
crews
in
there
and
they
run
an
average
distance
of
75
to
80
miles
a
day.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
five
men,
conductor,
two,
brakemen,
engineer
and
a
fireman.
for
many,
many
years,
we
operated
out
there
with
steam
engines.
and
as
you
may
know,
you
have
to
have
more
terminals
when
you
have
steam
engines.
they
gave
(inaudible)
for
them.
and
it
can't
have
as
many
cars.
at
any
rate,
some
25
years,
we
had
this
intra
--
so
called
divisional
service.
it's
not
an
interdivisional
service
at
all,
because
the
entire
area
as
one,
seniority
district.
the
board,
so
called,
is
maintained
in
wichita
falls.
there's
no
break
over
those
intermediate
cause
of
altus
and
elk
city
and
woodward.
i
drew
a
freight
crew.
it
operates
anywhere
within
that
whole
area.
he's
called
off
of
the
board
in
wichita
falls.
and
it's
because
of
those
peculiar
facts,
one
of
the
reasons
we
say,
that
this
so-called
intradivisional
rule
that
mr.
heiss
talks
about,
has
no
application.
we
say
it
was
never
intended
that
that
rule
apply
where
you
had
one
single
sort
of
seniority
district
and
anybody
working
on
that
district
could
run
anywhere.
furthermore,
that
rule
specifically
says
that
where
a
carrier
desires
to
establish
an
intradivisional
service,
that
service
that
we
had
had
been
established
25
years.
it
was
never
intended
to
apply
to
the
situation
other
than
where
you
wanted
to
create
an
intradivisional
service,
where
you
never
had
it
before.
furthermore,
that
rule
was
never
intended
to
be
retroactive.
i
knew
it
became
effective
on
august
1,
1952.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
yes,
sir.
it
really
does,
i've
mentioned,
because
it's
touched
upon
by
the
others.
excuse
me.
so,
we
say
that
this
intradivisional
rule
that
he
talks
about
doesn't
have
any
application
in
the
first
place.
now,
they
only
know
this
provision
that
you
here
are
going
to
find
these
rules
is
in
that
intradivisional
rule,
if
that
rule
applies.
and
for
example,
we
have
a
service.
i'll
illustrate
it
this
way.
we
have
crews
that
operate
from
dallas,
in
texas
to
fort
worth.
and
we
have
crews
that
operate
from
fort
worth
on
to
bellmead
or
waco.
now,
that's
one
seniority
district
from
dallas
and
to
waco.
but
we
have
an
agreement
with
them,
a
special
agreement
which
makes
us
change
crews
at
fort
worth.
now,
we
if
wanted
to
establish
a
run
from
dallas
into
waco,
through
fort
worth,
that
would
be
an
intradivional
service
and
we
would
have
to
comply
with
article
4,
because
it's
something
that
we
don't
have
now
and
are
prohibitive
now
by
agreement
from
him.
but
for
now
this
preliminary
--
here
injunction
was
issued,
at
the
hearing
on
december
the
18th.
a
contrary
to
our
opponent,
this
preliminary
injunction
is
not
a
condition.
there
is
not
one
single
word
in
this
injunction
which
even
indicates
that
the
court
intended
the
injunction
against
the
strike
to
be
conditioned
by
us
maintaining
or
is
doing
some
status
quo.
it's
a
straight
out,
mandatory
--
preliminary
mandatory
injunction
against
us.
but
it
doesn't
say
that
you
have
to
restore
the
status
quo.
it
says
that
if
you
elect
or
prefer,
you
can
leave
the
situation
as
it
is,
just
so
long
as
you
pay
these
people.
well
now,
the
district
court
was
not
attempting
to
protect
these
men
against
moving
or
against
disrupting
their
homes.
otherwise,
we
would
recommend
him
there.
all
he
was
concerned
about
was
that
these
men
be
paid,
one
way
or
the
other.
and
all
this
talk
about
disrupting
their
homes
and
all,
is
decided
before
the
court,
the
district
court
didn't
even
--
didn't
even
attempt
to
protect
it.
they
say
they
are
satisfied
with
the
district
court's
order.
well,
if
you're
satisfied
with
it,
they
are
satisfied
only
when
they
want
a
provision
of.
now,
we
appealed
from
this
preliminary
mandatory
injunction
on
december
the
29th.
and
we
applied
to
the
district
court
as
we
had
to,
for
a
motion
to
stay
the
operation
of
this
preliminary
injunction
against
us
until
we
could
appeal.
now,
we
say
that
when
we
appealed
from
that
on
december
the
29th,
the
district
court
was
ousted
of
any
jurisdiction
until
the
mandate
was
returned.
and
he
couldn't
modify
his
order
if
he
wanted
to.
and
we
say
that
he
can't
come
along
after
an
appeal
was
made
and
then
undertake
to
say
that
i
intended
thus
and
so,
when
he
didn't
say
it
the
first
instance.
but
he
denied
the
stay
order
and
we
went
from
the
fifth
circuit
and
they
granted
it.
and
i'd
like
to
mention
that
there
are
no
pleadings
of
any
character
to
support
this
preliminary
or
mandatory
injunction
against
us.
i
never
heard
of
a
situation
where
a
mandatory
injunction
was
issued
out,
somebody
asking
for
it.
these
people
didn't
ask
for
it.
it
was
gratuity,
apparently.
there's
no
evidence
of
any
kind
in
this
record
to
support
this
mandatory
injunction.
in
fact
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
by
these
people
at
all.
you
won't
find
any
evidence
to
support
anything
that
mr.
heiss
has
said
that
they
put
it
and
is
certainly
not
in
what
we
put.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
that's
correct.
there
was
no
security
required
at
all,
although
rule
65
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
says
that
"no
preliminary
injunction
shall
issue,
without
security,
being
required
in
whatever
amount
the
court
sees
fit
to
protect
the
people
against
whom
the
injunction
is
issued."
so,
we
say
that
even
for
those
reasons,
that
this
so-called
condition
which
is
not
a
condition,
but
a
preliminary
injunction
is
void
and
should
--
and
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
should
be
sustained.
but
now
getting
down
to
this
invasion
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
adjustment
board,
one,
i
believe,
justice
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
with
something
about
what
would
happen
if
the
--
if
the
board
sustained
this.
suppose
we
go
along
and
we
have
to
pay
out
$140,000
and
then
the
board
comes
along
and
says,
“well,
you're
right
in
the
first
place.
how
can
we
go
and
get
our
$140,000
back?”
apart
from
that,
to
the
extent
that
the
board
has
found
and
we
had
a
right
to
do
what
we
did,
there
is
a
direct
conflict
between
what
the
board
holds
and
what
this
court
requires.
the
court
says
“pay
them,
we
pay
them."
the
board
says,
“don't
pay
them,
you
don't
at
all.”
it
was
a
direct
conflict
and
to
that
extent
there's
bound
to
be
an
invasion.
you
can't
get
away
from
it.
i
don't
say
the
district
court
said,
“the
contract
requires
it.”
he
didn't
say
that.
but
he
puts
a
salient
position
where
there
can
be
and,
i
think,
will
be
a
direct
conflict
between
the
decision
of
the
board
and
this
preliminary
injunctions.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
i'm
glad
that
you
mentioned
that.
it's
true
that
we
submitted
to
the
adjustment
board
the
claim
to
violations
of
these
agreements.
but
it's
also
true
that
these
people
can
submit
to
us
time
claims.
they
can
say,
“you
had
no
right
to
deprive
these
10
men
to
work
and
you
owe
us
for
everyday
that
you
didn't
use
them.”
if
we
deny
those
time
claims,
they
can
go
to
the
adjustment
board
on
those
time
claims.
and
that
time
claim
demands
can
be
consolidated
with
this
thing
that
we
have
here
now.
and
if
the
board
holds
it
against
us,
they
can
award
payment
of
every
dollar
that
they
would've
been
paid
if
this
change
had
never
been
made.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
sir?
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
under
the
--
now,
under
the
statute,
as
i
understand
it,
a
money
award
is
not
binding
(inaudible)
binding
here
until
the
court
award
them
--
a
court
orders
the
payment
on
them.
we
could
pay
it.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
we
could
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
we
would
not
be
required
to,
but
in
that
suit
they
get
their
highest
fees.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
yes,
sir.
we
--
we
made
that
suggestion
in
the
district
court
ourselves.
we
said
to
judge
davidson
were
adjudged,
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
put
the
money
in
escrow.
so,
we'll
have
some
protection.
and
he
said,
“i'm
not
interested
in
your
escrow.
and
he
took
it
as
an
offense.
you'll
find
that
in
the
record.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
that
would
have
protected
both
sides,
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
and
that
distinguishes
the
inland
steel
company
case
that
they
cite.
in
that
case
the
court
did
take
the
money
and
put
in
on
a
fund.
and
furthermore,
in
that
case,
which
they
rely
upon,
the
attorney,
for
the
party
opposing
in,
agreed
to
it,
which
is
not
--
those
two
things
distinguishing
the
steel
case.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
that's
what
it
amounted
to.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
we
were
willing
to
do
it.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
the
record's
--
the
record
--
it
contains
and
i
think
--
about
page
300
and
--
let
me
see.
302,
is
where
mr.
touchstone,
one
of
our
attorneys,
brought
the
subject
up.
let's
see.
last
line
on
302,
the
court
i
don't
think
any
stock
in
your
indemnity
(inaudible)
or
escrow
agreement.
and
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
it's
page
302
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
where
that
statement
appeared,
302.
and
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
it
might
have
been
and
i'm
not
sure
but
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
that
--
that's
probably
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
i
know,
but
it
--
that's
true.
but
at
least,
would
have
in
part,
satisfied
the
requirement
of
law
that
we
be
given
some
protection.
all
the
way
through,
apparently,
the
judge
rather
assumed
that
there
had
been
some
violations
to
these
agreements.
well,
there
hasn't
been,
as
i
will
try
to
show
you
and
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
the
very
fact
that
he
ordered
us
to
either
restore
the
status
quo
or
to
take
care,
but
in
the
meantime,
rather
indicates
certainly,
and
i
can't
point
out
the
other
places,
but
all
the
way
through
that's
import
evidence
i
get.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
probably
there's
some.
[laughs]
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
well,
that
i
--
i
think
that's
probably
true.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
the
only
--
the
--
the
thing
that's
most
important
is,
is
what
he
did.
actually
--
regardless
of
what
he
said,
the
fact
that
remains
that
this
is
what
he
did
and
if
as
a
matter
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
yes.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
no,
i
didn't
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
i
didn't
mean
to
say
if
i
did,
that
it
indicated
that
he
was
deciding
the
merits.
what
i
had
in
mind
was
it
indicated
that
he
had
thought
perhaps,
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
that's
what
i
meant
to
say.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
well,
if
he
thought
there's
a
violation
of
the
agreement,
it
might
influence
him
in
attaching
a
--
putting
this
mandatory
injunction
on
us.
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
yes,
he
did
have
a
misunderstanding
about
that.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
no,
we
didn't
go
back,
as
we
appealed,
but
following
the
preliminary
mandatory
injunction.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
was
in
the
district
court
or
the
circuit
court,
but
in
one
of
them,
i
was
asked
my
best
guess
on
it,
and
that
my
best
guess
was
probably
more
than
four
years,
but
i'm
not
sure
it
was
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
he
did
have
that
idea
at
that
particular
point.
i
don't
know
right
now
whether
it
was
cleared
up
more
elsewhere
or
not.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
i
think
he
had
in
mind
that
if
the
strike
were
to
continue
and
the
matter
were
not
disposed
of,
that
there'd
be
that
many
or
more
involved.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
no.
they
were
five
crews,
originally,
with
five
men
on
each.
that's
25
men.
in
linking
in
these
runs,
we
took
off
two
crews
or
10
men
and
left
all
the
men
who
were
involved
in
this
litigation.
of
course,
as
mr.
heiss
says,
the
chicago
river
case
holds
that
you
may
enjoin
a
strike
while
the
matter
is
pending
before
the
adjustment
board.
but
we
think
that
the
decision
and
certainly
the
reasoning
in
pitney
case,
sustains
us
in
this
particular
matter.
as
mr.
justice
black
probably
remembers,
he
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
case
in
the
order
of
railway
conductors,
brought
a
suit
to
--
among
other
things,
enjoin
the
trustees
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
from
--
assigning
certain
jobs
to
men
who
belong
to
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
and
i
have
to
get
some
of
this
from
a
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
rutledge
but
it
appear
--
appears
from
what
what
the
majority
opinion
says
and
what
the
dissenting
opinion
says
that
for
a
while,
until
there
was
a
hearing
in
the
case,
there
was
a
temporary
order
issued
which
prevented
that
transfer
of
work
from
the
o.r.c
to
the
b.r.t
men.
the
decision
in
this
case
was
that
no
court
could
invade
the
jurisdiction
of
the
adjustment
board,
that
the
thing
for
the
o.r.c.
is
due,
would
be
two
of
the
adjustment
board
and
find
out
and
let
the
board
see,
whether
its
contract
gave
it
the
right
to
these
jobs
or
not.
and
if
they
did
have
the
right,
then
maybe
the
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
equity
power,
to
protect
what
the
sum
in
substance
or
it
was
that
until
and
unless
they
went
to
the
board
and
got
a
decision
of
the
board
that,
they
were
entitled
to
the
work,
rather
than
the
b.r.t.,
that
no
court,
including
a
court
of
equity,
give
--
to
give
them
relief.
justice
rutledge,
in
a
long
dissent,
expressed
the
thought
that
these
men
ought
to
be
protected
until
the
decision
of
the
board.
but
apparently,
the
other
members
of
the
court
thought
otherwise,
because
he
was
the
only
one
that
raised
that
particular
issue.
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
which
reaffirmed
in
the
pitney
case,
also
written
by
mr.
justice
black.
the
--
and
not
only
reaffirmed
that,
pitney
case,
but
they
said
no
court,
state
or
federal,
can
invade
the
jurisdiction
of
the
adjustment
board.
now,
we
understand
that
that
simply
means
that
this
adjustment
board
has
been
set
up
to
decide
these
questions
and
that
the
no
court
can
interfere
in
anyway
with
respect
to
any
part
evidence,
you'd
have
to
take
it
then,
that's
been
decided.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
it's
my
opinion,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
he
felt
like
when
he
was
required
to
do
it
on
the
chicago
river
case,
and
he
did
it
because
of
that.
and
i'm
not
so
sure
that
we
would
have
gotten
it,
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
chicago
river
case.
but
i
don't
know
anything
else,
(inaudible)
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
i
think
he
felt
that
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
i
think
he
felt
that
on
the
chicago
junction
case,
where
this
--
their
submission
haven't
been
made
with
the
adjustment
board
as
he
knew
and
their
copies
of
their
submissions
were
attached
to
an
amended
pleading
of
ours,
that
he
had
no
discretion
about
it
and
was
required
the
issue
the
injunction
against
the
strike.
not
only
do
we
think
the
pitney
case
sustains
us,
but
there
is
in
--
other
decisions
of
this
court
have
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
that
maybe
true,
but
that
occurred
on
january
the
5th,
1959.
the
injunction
was
issued
on
december
18th,
an
appeal
on
december
29th.
so,
if
it
was
an
afterthought
on
his
part.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
in
the
--
in
the
central
kentucky
gas
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
which
itself,
was
cited
in
the
inland
steel
case.
there
--
the
court
there
recognized
that
the
right
to
attach
conditions
was
not
unlimited,
and
in
that
case
they
struck
down
conditions,
because
the
court
found
that
the
--
the
lower
court
had
no
constitutional
right
to
impose
the
condition
involving
gas
rate.
and
also
in
another
case
which
is
cited,
magniac
versus
thompson,
i
believe,
an
old
case,
this
court
recognized
that
--
aware
that
the
--
the
court
of
equity,
notwithstanding,
his
equity
powers,
was
required
to
follow
the
law.
we
feel
like
that
the
chicago
river
case
and
the
pitney
case
and
the
(inaudible)
case
has
charted
the
course
for
both
parties
in
this
case
and
therefore,
a
court
of
equity
does
not
have
a
power
in
the
exercise
of
equity
powers
to
vary
from
those
decisions
and
that
route
that's
been
prescribed
for
us.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
well
then,
thank
you
very
much.
