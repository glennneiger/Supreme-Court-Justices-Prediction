well,
that
--
would
that
statement
of
the
judge
--
a
couple
paragraphs
earlier,
mr.
clinton,
indicate
that
it
is
also
influenced
by
the
fact
that
even
an
escrow
arrangement
would
have
meant
that
these
men
would
have
been
out
of
work
for
a
while?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
says
--
we
know
they
are
risking
everything,
three
months
wages
knocked
out,
would
put
the
wolf
at
their
door.

in
the
escrow,
that's
where
wouldn't
have
paid
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse,
mr.
clinton,
i'm
not
--
i
noticed
within
the
record
at
318,
though
he
said;
"i
am
a
little
uncertain.
of
course,
i
could
just
wash
my
hands
and
live
to
say,
go
on
with
your
strike,
but
don't
think
i
will."
that's
at
page
318
of
the
record."
i
will
withhold
my
decision
until
i
can
read
this
over,
but
i
feel
that
this
strike
should
not
occur,
if
justice
can
be
made
to
prevail
without
it."
in
that
--
that
suggestion
of
some
taking
that
he
had
some
discretion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
