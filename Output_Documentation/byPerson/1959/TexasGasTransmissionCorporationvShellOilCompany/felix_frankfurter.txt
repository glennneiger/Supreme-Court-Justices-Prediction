justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
doesn't
--
doesn't
justice
harlan's
question
rather
suggest
the
decisive
test
about
this
part
of
--
of
problems
of
the
case,
namely,
for
declaration
for
declaratory
judgment,
it
has
to
be
dismissed
or
at
least
held
unless
the
ruling
is
held
from
the
federal
power
commission,
that's
one
thing,
if
the
district
court
could,
on
its
own,
construe
the
contract
without
further
ado,
that
present
another
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
reach
a
different
conclusion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
well
be
like
in
the
(inaudible)
case
that
when
--
when
--
if
there
is
a
reference
to
the
agency,
the
federal
power
commission
here,
as
to
meaning,
and
it
goes
back
and
doesn't
have
to
say
that
they
would
be
controlled
by
it
but
if
it's
--
if
it's
a
problem,
puts
a
question
as
to
which,
in
any
event,
there
should
be
a
preliminary,
even
if
not
a
final
ruling
by
the
federal
power
commission,
one
starts
with
a
different
premise
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
--
take
the
cases
that
i
think
to
get
least
mystery
by
this
court's
decisions
are
concerned,
at
least
to
me
the
construction
of
tariffs
in
relation
of
courts
to
the
icc.
now,
is
this
a
case
that
would
--
would
be
like
the
great
northern
where
justice
brandeis,
through
the
court,
held
no,
this
isn't.
it
doesn't
require
any
kind
of
knowledge.
this
is
just
--
any
judge
can
decide
this
at
least
presumably,
at
all
event,
the
court
problem
and
without
any
light
to
be
shed
rather
than
whether
it's
an
ambiguous
thing
as
to
which
will
send
it
on
to
the
commission
and
they
may
say,
â€œwell,
this
is
not
a
technical
thing
at
all.
it
has
no
technical
meaning
in
the
trade
and
we
send
it
back
without
any
--
i
mean
it
maybe
ambiguous
to
that
extent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
in
answer
to
another
question
of
justice
harlan,
whether
this
is
a
typical
escalation
contract
or
terms,
you
--
you
said
you
thought
it
was,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
same
kind
of
thing.
well,
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
this
were
a
unique
one,
then
there
couldn't
be
any
trade
meaning
for
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
any
--
or
any
commission
construction.
on
the
other
hand,
if
this
is
a
--
if
this
is
a
type
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
this
represents
a
class,
then
you
might
draw
some
other
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
that
issue
of
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
can
you
--
how
can
you
be
sure
can
a
man
with
limited
experience
in
this
field,
like
myself,
be
sure
that
by
reading
words,
the
english
meaning
of
which
he
understand
that
entrusted
upon
those
--
those
seemingly
ordinary
english
words,
there
isn't
a
lot
of
back
history
in
the
trade?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
commission
construction,
mr.
stone.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
stone,
may
i
--
may
i
make
this
comment
on
your
quite
natural
and
proper
claim,
if
i
may
so,
with
reference
of
how
courts
go
about
construing
an
ordinary
commercial
contract.
i
believe
they
do
the
best
they
can
and
get
testimony
and
so
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
let
me
recall
the
way
lord
mansfield
did
it.
he
had
dinner
with
merchants
in
london
to
find
out
what
the
understanding
of
the
business
community
was.
but
there
is
a
difference
--
isn't
there
a
difference
when
you
deal
with
an
industry
for
which
congress
has
set
up
a
regulatory
scheme
and
has
set
up
a
regulatory
body
as
it
were
to
provide
a
regime
in
the
first
instance
for
problem
that
arise
within
that
industry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
can't
do
anything
in
an
ordinary
commercial
contract
that
the
case
comes
before
any
of
the
judges,
judge
winfield
or
judge
murphy
or
whoever
it
is
in
the
southern
district.
all
he
can
do
is
to
do
the
best
that
he
can
and
hear
witnesses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
other
way
of
--
of
enlightening
him
except
through
books
and
witnesses
and
his
own
good
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
come
--
to
the
federal
power
commission,
the
icc
and
all
the
rest
of
them,
then
you've
got
an
intervening
body
whose
job
it
is
to
inform
itself
about
those
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
interrupt
you?
has
the
commission
construed
these
words?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
of
more
--
i
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
know
lower
courts
are
very
sensitive
about
not
wanting
to
be
rubber
stamps
but
as
judge
learned
hand
with
characteristic
of
candor
said
to
a
large
extent
that
that's
what
they
want
to
call
it,
that's
what
they
want
to
call
it
in
the
distribution
of
power
between
the
agencies
and
courts
is
a
limit
to
the
extent
that
they
can
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
must
respect
a
determination
if
it's
within
the
power
of
the
commission
to
make
the
determination
and
not
set
even
their
own
superior
with
them
against
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
--
if
you're
right
that
this
is
--
has
no
specialized
meaning,
but
i
like
to
add
one
more
word
of
our
interchange,
i
think
to
talk
about
the
construction
of
a
contact
being
a
question
of
law
is,
itself,
a
very
unfortunate
way
of
putting
a
simple
fact
that
it's
for
courts
and
not
for
jurists
construed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
there
is
to
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
call
it
--
to
call
it
a
question
of
law
is
just
giving
a
nice
big
evasive
term
to
--
to
a
very
different
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
say
--
would
you
say
that
the
--
that
the
construction
of
the
commission
for
(inaudible)
wasn't
allowable
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
you
are
in
quiet
in
the
clear
if
that's
what
--
if
you're
right
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
better
inconsistent
here,
i
guess.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
your
argument,
mr.
stone.
it
is
this,
that
the
power
commission
necessarily
had
to
construe
the
contract
no
matter
what
--
what
--
into
what
pigeonhole
of
--
of
authority
as
the
commission
in
court
on
the
place
of
it.
it
necessarily
had
to
construe
the
contract,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
did
give
a
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
the
construction
that
it
gave
was
not
to
a
technical
specialized
use
of
english
words
but
ordinary
use
of
english
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
been
technical
or
if
they
had
established
that
the
practice
in
the
trade
was
that
it
mean
--
meant
thus
and
so,
then
it
would
be
withdrawn
from
judicial
scrutiny
and
revision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
here
that
this
is
not
an
--
an
adjudication
binding
on
the
court
because
one
was
made
by
the
commission
but
merely
that
it
--
in
order
to
do
its
job,
it
has
to
construe
the
contract
but
that
did
not
foreclose
the
court
of
appeals
from
getting
its
construction
any
more
than
the
construction
of
a
district
court
who
foreclosed
the
court
of
appeals
from
saying
that
was
a
wrong
construction,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
the
sum
of
your
argument?
