mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
ask
for
the
privilege
of
opening
the
argument
in
this
case
because
to
us,
it
presents
more
than
merely
a
dispute
between
two
private
litigants.
it
concerns
a
matter
of
regulatory
control
which
we
regard
as
rather
vital.
in
these
cases,
the
court
is
asked
to
decide
whether
or
not
a
favored-nation
escalation
clause
in
a
contract
of
shell
oil
company
and
the
texas
gas
transmission
company
was
triggered,
that
is
made
effective
by
a
higher
rate
paid
by
texas
gas
under
another
contract
with
another
producer,
atlantic
refining
company.
the
answer
to
this
question
is
required
in
order
to
determine
the
effective
rates
to
be
charged
by
shell
under
the
natural
gas
act
as
of
june
7,
1954.
the
date
used
by
the
federal
power
commission
to
start
the
regulatory
controls
under
that
act
as
applied
to
independent
producers
of
natural
gas.
the
court
well
remembers
that
the
phillips
petroleum
company
case
was
decided
on
june
7,
1954,
holding
independent
producers
to
be
subject
to
the
natural
gas
act.
as
shell
entered
into
its
contract
in
1951
with
louisiana
natural
gas
company,
a
subsidiary
of
texas
gas
and
then
the
subsidiary
was
later
merged
into
texas
gas
and
we
will
refer
to
this
1951
contract
as
the
shell
contract
because
it
is
the
first
one
that
needs
attention.
the
favored-nation
escalation
clause
in
this
shell
contract
provide
that
if
anytime
the
buyer
enters
into
a
contract
providing
for
the
purchase
of
gas
produced
by
a
field
within
50
miles
of
the
shell
field
and
the
price
payable
by
the
buyer
is
higher
than
the
price
under
the
1951
shell
contract,
the
buyer
has
to
pay
shell
the
same
higher
price.
the
1951
shell
contract
calls
for
a
price
of
8.997
a
thousand
cubic
feet
for
all
gas
purchased
after
january
1,
1952
through
december
1956,
thus,
higher
price
is
called
for
under
the
escalation
clause.
on
june
7,
1954,
texas
gas
was
the
buyer
and
this
8.97
--
997-cent
rate
would,
if
it
--
the
rate
fixed
in
the
contract
applied,
the
either
rate
which
would
be
the
initial
rate
used
by
the
commission
and
by
the
companies
as
the
start
of
their
service
under
the
natural
gas
act.
now,
the
contract
which
is
said
that
triggered
the
shell
contract
was
entered
into
in
1943
by
atlantic
refining
company
as
a
seller
and
the
united
states
government
as
the
--
as
the
buyer,
and
then
the
united
states
government
has
transferred
and
finally,
texas
gas
gets
it
as
buyer
and
--
and
texas
gas
was
the
buyer
under
both
contracts
on
june
7,
1954.
the
gas
was
sold
under
this
atlantic
contract
originally
at
2.2
cents
per
mcf
and
the
contract
was
to
continue
for
the
producing
life
of
the
field
but
not
longer
than
25
years.
there's
a
slight
error
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
where
it
refers
to
a
20-year
contract
whereas
it
actually
is
a
25.
the
seller
agreed
to
sell
and
the
buyer
agreed
to
buy
under
this
atlantic
contract
specified
daily
quantities
of
gas,
and
that's
important.
under
the
atlantic
contract,
no
price
was
fixed
after
the
first
five
years,
started
off
and
said
that
during
the
first
five
years
of
the
2.2
cents
and
then
after
that,
the
buyer
and
the
seller
were
to
reach
an
agreement
as
to
the
price
for
the
second
five
year
period.
and
after
--
in
doing
that,
they
would
consider
the
prevailing
market
price
for
gas
sold
in
that
area,
southeast
and
southwestern
louisiana.
and
then
the
price
for
each
succeeding
five-year
period
would
be
similarly
determined
or
agreed
upon
by
the
parties.
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
there
was
a
provision
for
arbitration
and
that's
the
most
important
because
to
us,
the
arbitration
agreement
means
that
this
1943
contract
continues
for
25
years
and
that
the
mere
incident
of
a
price
adjustment
or
a
price
determination
could
be
by
the
parties
if
they
were
able
to
do
so
or
under
arbitration,
so
that
to
us,
it
was
not
a
new
contract
entered
into
in
1953
when
the
third
five-year
period
started.
now,
there
was
an
agreement
for
the
second
five-year
period.
they
had
a
letter
agreement
and
then
it
went
up,
and
for
a
few
months
from
september,
they
had
a
six
months
period
where
they
did
agree.
on
september
of
1953,
they
did
agree.
and
then
they
come
up
to
this
period
which
really
affects
what
we're
talking
about
here.
under
the
atlantic
contract,
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
just
how
much
the
third
period
should
cover,
what
price
should
be
determined.
and
it
was
not
until
february
of
1954,
and
i
mentioned
that
because
you
see
that
is
after
september
1st,
1953
when
the
third
period
started.
not
until
february
1954
that
they
decided
that
they
would
pay,
that
texas
gas
would
pay
and
as
far
as
atlantic
was
concerned,
it
was
satisfactory.
they
would
pay
12.5
cents.
so
that
from
september
1953
on,
for
the
balance
of
the
five-year
term,
the
rate
was
12.5
cents.
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
yes,
sir.
and
we
call
that
the
1953
agreement
although
it
was
entered
into
in
february.
it's
the
1953
agreement
because
that's
in
the
third
period.
now,
when
shell,
a
month
later,
that
is
monday
after
this
february
17th
later
--
letter,
found
that
there
had
been
an
--
an
escalation
under
the
atlantic
contract.
shell
told
the
--
the
buyer,
texas
gas,
in
19
--
march
1954
that
its
price
had
gone
up
automatically
with
the
increase
in
the
price
paid
to
atlantic
and
therefore,
under
the
shell
contract,
instead
of
an
8.9
cent
price,
there
was
a
12-cent
--
12.5-cent
price
which
should
be
paid
by
texas
gas.
and
then
as
i
said,
this
court
decided
in
june
of
1954
right
after
this,
decided
that
the
independent
producer
was
subject
to
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
commission
started
to
impose
the
controls
called
for
by
that
act.
one
of
the
controls
of
course
was
the
filing
of
rate
schedules.
now,
independent
producers
don't
have
rate
schedules
and
tariff,
one
where
they
agree
to
sell
the
whole,
those
who
may
apply
such
as
an
interstate
pipeline
may
do
but
they
have
individual
contracts.
and
we
were
--
we
thought
we
were
faced
with
a
prospect
of
having
a
great
many
thousand
individual
contracts
filed.
well,
we
didn't
estimate
that
there'll
be
46,000
by
april
1960
but
that's
what
has
happened,
and
then
some
10,000
--
over
10,000
basic
contracts
that
have
been
filed
with
us
and
with
no
increase
in
staff
and
the
tremendous
burden
which
we
anticipated,
the
commission
did
the
best
thing
it
could
and
tried
to
see
that
the
filing
requirements
were
met
properly
and
rather
than
they
require,
all
of
these
producers
to
place
their
individual
contracts
into
a
tariff
form,
they
said,
“file
your
contracts.”
but
by
way
of
assisting
in
an
understanding
of
what
rate
would
be
involved,
they
ask
that
they
file
also
with
the
contract,
but
really
not
a
rate
schedule,
they
filed
a
billing
statement.
at
the
end
of
each
month,
the
company
that
buys
submits
a
statement
to
the
producer
and
says,
“we
have
taken
so
many
cubic
feet
of
gas
and
under
our
contract,
the
rate
for
that
month
is
--
8
cents,”
or
whatever
it
might
be.
and
those
billing
statements
assist
us
and
assist
those
who
come
before
us
in
understanding
what
exactly
is
the
agreement
stated
in
these
very
confusing
individual
contracts
that
the
producers
have.
they
are
long,
they
are
complex.
you
will
find
two
contracts
involved
here
taking
up
some
14
printed
pages
with
very
intricate
provisions
as
to
temperatures
and
impurities
and
there
is
the
pressure
and
place
of
taking
and
so
on.
and
--
and
then
also,
on
page
65
of
the
record,
the
shell
contract
list,
the
--
the
rates
which
would
obtain
during
certain
periods,
absent
the
escalation
clause
and
then
goes
on
and
has
the
escalation
clause
set
up
very
clearly.
now,
we
have
printed
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
the
escalation
clauses
that
are
involved
here.
the
first,
the
shell
is
on
page
--
starts
on
page
four
of
our
brief.
and
--
and
i
think
the
--
just
a
brief
reading
of
that,
hasty
reading
of
that
may
assist
if
at
any
time
after
december
31,
1951,
the
buyer
that
is
texas
gas
at
this
time,
shall
enter
into
a
contract
providing
for
the
purchase
by
it
of
gas
produced
from
the
field
or
fields
located
and
delivered
to
buyer
within
a
radius
of
50
miles,
then
buyers
to
notify
seller
of
that
fact
in
the
price.
if
the
price
per
thousand
cubic
feet
is
more
under
the
other
contract,
then
it
was
another
shell
contract,
then
the
shell
contract
price
goes
up.
now,
what
was
it
that
triggered
it?
well,
shell
says
that
this
contract
under
which
texas
gas
on
june
4,
19
--
june
7,
1954
was
buying
gas
from
atlantic
refining,
another
producer
that
that
was
a
new
contract.
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
a
new
contract.
that's
what
shell
says
and
that's
what
the
third
circuit
said.
and
that
--
the
escalation
clause
is
printed
on
page
--
starting
on
page
five.
at
the
end
of
the
first
five-year
period,
buyer
and
seller
are
to
reach
an
agreement
as
to
the
price
for
gas
sold
and
delivered
under
this
contract
during
the
second
five-year
period.
the
price
to
be
paid
during
each
second
five-year
period
is
to
be
agreed
upon
at
the
beginning
of
such
period
after
a
survey
of
prevailing
prices
for
gas
sold
in
similar
quantities
in
the
southwestern
part
of
louisiana
and
so,
during
each
succeeding
part
and
then
arbitration
if
they
are
unable
to
agree.
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
well,
the
25
year
--
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
--
contract
is
with
atlantic.
and
--
and
--
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
--
we
think
--
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
--
we
think
there
is
no
question.
but
what
the
producer,
atlantic
refining
was
committed
for
the
full
25-year
period.
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
irrespective.
yes,
sir.
the
third
circuit,
however,
said
that
is
a
continuing
contract
for
the
delivery
of
gas.
but
obviously,
gas
is
to
be
paid
for
if
it
is
delivered.
and
that
there
would
not
be
a
final
contract
as
to
the
second
and
third
and
fourth,
five-year
period
until
there
was
an
agreement
upon
the
price.
and
therefore,
under
this
atlantic
contract,
the
third
circuit
says,
“there
was
an
agreement
only
in
february
--
in
the
february
17
letter,"
1954
extending
back
to
september
1,
1953.
there
was
only
an
agreement
at
that
time
upon
the
price.
and
therefore,
that
was
the
entering
of
a
new
contract.
and
in
our
opinion,
they
disregard
the
language
in
the
shell
contract
that
the
escalation
was
to
occur
when
there
was
a
new
contract
for
the
purchase
of
gas.
we
think
that
it's
most
important
that
that
be
born
in
mind.
now
--
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
yes,
sir.
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
think
there's
no
question
on
that.
it
--
they
are
not
a
contract
for
the
purchase
of
gas.
they
are
merely
carrying
out
a
provision
that
was
set
out
in
this
atlantic
contract
of
1943,
namely
an
agreement
upon
the
price.
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
there
would
have
been,
not
only
for
shell
--
not
--
not
for
atlantic,
for
atlantic
to
deliver
and
texas
to
buy.
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
now,
there,
had
the
parties
not
agreed,
they
would
of
course
have
to
go
to
arbitration
to
determine
the
price.
but
the
--
the
contract
and
the
important
thing
for
this
pipeline
companies
is
the
supply.
the
supply
would
have
been
available
during
the
whole
25-year
period
at
the
place
of
delivery
called
for.
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
no,
you
honor,
mr.
justice
whitaker,
i
think
really,
this
letter
of
february
17th
demonstrates
what
happens.
they
continue
to
pay
the
prior
price.
but
on
february
17,
1954,
they
agreed
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
third
period,
september
01,
1953.
agreed
to
go
back
and
just
pay
12.5
cents
from
that
september
1st
on.
an
absence
--
absent
that
february
17's
letter,
i
would
think
that
the
parties
would
have
continued
to
go
under
the
prior
rate.
but
always,
there
would
be
an
obligation
upon
the
pipeline
purchaser
that
is
texas
gas,
to
make
up
any
difference,
ultimately,
determined
either
by
agreement
among
the
parties
or
by
arbitration
between
the
price
for
the
second
or
third
or
fourth
year
five-year
period
over
what
have
be
--
previously
been
collected.
i
think
that
letter
of
february
17th
is
most
significant
in
that
aspect
of
it.
now,
i
--
i
will
deal
in
my
presentation
with
what
we
regard
as
the
limited
scope
of
judicial
review
under
the
facts
which
i
had
given
so
far.
the
--
we
think
the
third
circuit,
reading
this
as
a
strictly
legal
document,
the
contract
which
could
be
interpreted
by
the
court.
but
that
was
all
that
there
was
to
it
and
that
therefore,
since
the
contract,
the
third
circuit
called
for
a
new
agreement
every
five
years.
that
new
agreement
under
the
atlantic
contract
became
a
new
agreement
under
the
shell
and
automatically
triggered
the
escalation.
if
it
did
trigger
the
escalation
of
the
shell
contract,
then
on
june
7,
1954,
the
rate
was
12.5
cents
as
claimed
by
shell
and
not
8.997
as
found
by
the
federal
power
commission.
now,
the
--
when
the
commission
examined
the
billing
statement
that
was
filed
with
this
shell
contract,
i
noticed
the
discrepancy.
it
said,
“well,
we
will
not
receive
nor
reject.
we'll
not
accept
nor
reject
the
contract,
but
we
will
ask
for
an
explanation.”
and
we
--
we
set
that
letter
to
them
in
january
of
1955.
it
was
not
until
february
of
1957
that
the
explanation
was
given
and
it
was
then
given
not
because
there
was
a
continuing
situation,
but
because
they
had
applied
in
february
of
1957.
two
years
later,
they
applied
for
an
increase
in
the
shell
rate
to
16
and
--
and
34
cents.
we
have
--
we
had
suspended
that
and
--
and
set
it
down
for
hearing,
then
it
was
placed
into
effect
as
it
could
be
at
the
end
of
the
suspension
period.
and
we
have
not
yet
gotten
around
to
a
determination
as
to
whether
that
is
a
just
and
reasonable
rate,
but
it
is
being
collected
at
16
cents.
but
that
means
that
from
september
1,
1953
up
to
february
1957,
there
is
a
rate
in
dispute
between
these
parties
which
amounts
to
some
$10,497
every
month
on
the
average,
going
on
all
of
this
time,
because
texas
has
paid
the
8.997
rate
right
along.
and
shell
for
some
reason
which
escaped
me
didn't
press
its
claim,
either
with
the
company
or
before
the
commission,
didn't
press
its
claim
during
this
interval.
now,
the
reason
these
escalation
clauses
to
us
are
a
little
more
than
merely
just
concerning
two
companies
which
are
before
the
court
is
this.
many
--
many
of
these
contracts
originally
with
the
producers
had
to
be
for
a
long
periods.
it
cost
a
lot
of
money
to
put
in
the
pipe
and
compressor
stations
and
other
facilities
to
get
gas
from
this
producing
fields
up
to
the
markets
where
they
--
where
the
gas
can
be
sold
most
profitably.
and
the
pipeline
companies
cannot
afford
to
undertake
those
--
that
expensive
investment
nor
will
the
financial
houses
underwrite
them
and
issue
these
securities
until
there
is
a
--
an
assurance
of
a
supply
for
a
reasonable
period.
most
of
them
as
the
shell
contract
are
for
20
years,
but
some
of
them
as
the
atlantic
contract,
are
for
25
years.
and
--
and
the
producers
in
wanting
to
protect
themselves
economically
against
the
inflation
that
has
gone
on
in
--
in
the
oil
field
of
steadily
rising
prices
have
used
these
escalation
clauses.
originally,
they
were
fixed
escalations.
every
two
years
or
five
years
or
whatever
the
period
might
be
would
--
the
price
would
go
up
one
cent,
two
cents,
or
three
cents.
and
under
a
contract
like
that,
you
could
look
at
it
and
say
at
the
beginning
exactly
what
would
be
paid
and
that
the
pipeline
purchaser
would
be
able
to
tell
its
customers
exactly
what
they
would
have
to
pay
because
all
of
the
rates
could
be
determined.
but
they
found
that
those
fixed
periodic
escalations
did
not
give
enough
return
to
the
producers
and
so
they
resorted
to
these
indefinite
pricing
agreements
which
we
call
escalation
clauses,
where
price
might
go
up
by
reason
or
the
buyer
under
this
particular
contract
paying
more
to
another
buyer
or
because
he
enters
into
a
new
contract
to
another
producer
or
where
he
enters
into
a
new
contract
with
some
other
producer
or
because
there's
a
rise
in
the
field
prices
or
a
commodity
index
or
--
or
some
other
fixed
--
some
other
indefinite
provision
whereby
at
some
time,
in
some
manner,
there
would
be
an
additional
price
paid.
now,
the
two
kinds
with
which
we
are
concerned
right
here
are
very,
very
simply
stated.
one,
which
we
think
the
court
mistakenly
attributed
to
the
atlantic
contract
is
where
a
producer
--
where
a
pipeline
company
enters
into
a
new
contract
for
a
new
supply
of
gas
and
pays
more
than
he
is
playing
--
paying
to
his
old
supplier.
and
we
don't
think
that
was
this
situation
at
all.
we
think
that
this
situation
was
where
the
pipeline
company
has
an
agreement
that
could
go
out
and
say,
“if
we
pay
anything
more
than
--
to
anybody
else,
then
we
will
pay
you.”
now,
we
think
that
under
the
texas
agreement,
texas
gas
company
agreement
with
atlantic,
they
were
not
obligated.
they
were
not
obligated
to
pay
shell
by
reason
to
the
fact
that
shell
had
put
into
its
contract
this
escalation
clause
which
i
--
which
i
read
to
you
on
page
five
of
our
brief
that
only
if
there
was
a
new
contract.
when
it
came
before
the
commission
after
the
hearing
had
been
held
and
that
all
of
the
testimony
taken
they
had
any
--
that
anyone
offered,
the
trial
examiner,
hearing
examiner
said,
"why,
this
obviously
is
a
contract
that
texas
has
now
entered
into
calling
for
a
12-cent
price
and
therefore,
the
shell
price
automatically
went
up
to
12.5
cents.
and
he
allowed
them
12.5
cents.
the
federal
power
commission
on
the
other
hand
said
this
is
not
a
new
contract
and
it
said
three
things
have
--
would
control.
first,
the
rate
actually
being
paid
on
june
7,
1954
was
8.997
cents
and
therefore,
that
is
the
rate
which
we
will
recognize.
now,
that
ground
as
subject
had
only
been
dropped
because
of
some
cases
which
have
come
up
since
then.
but
the
commission
also
said,
"the
contract
that
shell
has
with
texas
gas
calls
for
a
new
agreement
to
be
entered
into
for
the
purchase
of
gas
from
some
other
producer.
and
this
obviously
is
not
a
new
agreement
with
--
between
atlantic
and
texas
gas
and
therefore,
the
rate
has
not
been
escalated
to
12.5
cents.
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
oh
--
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
well,
i
have
been
reading
it
in
because
as
i
read
and
i've
--
i'm
starting
at
the
bottom
of
page
three,
mr.
justice
whitaker,
in
paragraph
--
page
four
of
our
other
commission's
brief.
yes,
sir.
the
bottom
of
page
4,
the
commission's
brief,
i'm
reading
paragraph
3.
"if
at
any
time
after
december
31,
1951,
buyer
of
texas
gas
shall
enter
into
a
contract."
now,
i
can't
read
that
any
other
way
if
it's
a
renewal
of
a
contract.
well,
that
is
a
simple
thing
to
state.
and
shell
has
many
contracts
which
it
says
--
in
which
it
says
that
if
a
rate
is
paid
under
an
existing
contract
that
is
higher
than
this
one,
then
this
one
will
be
escalated.
but
this
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
"it
shall
enter
into
a
contract"
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
enter
into
a
contract
unless
it
is
a
new
contract.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
axiomatic
that
you
either
do
or
do
not
have
a
contract.
and
if
you
have
to
enter
into
one,
they
know
how
to
use
language
and
they
have
many,
many
contracts.
the
shell
company
has
--
has
been
doing
this
for
a
great
many
years
and
they
--
this
is
a
matter
of
negotiation
between
the
companies
where
the
pipeline
is
trying
to
protect
itself.
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
well,
i
--
your
honor
--
mr.
willard
w.
gatchell
well,
i
think
--
i
think,
your
honor,
the
answer
to
both
of
those
question
is
--
is
a
very
simple
statement.
if
a
company
knows
that
by
entering
into
a
contract
with
another
producer,
the
pipeline
will
have
to
pay
more
for
a
gas,
which
it
is
purchasing
in
this
case
from
shell.
and
if
its
facilities
for
taking
gas,
for
transporting
gas
in
interstate
commerce,
are
pretty
well
filled
up
anyhow,
it
will
not
go
into
that
field
to
get
a
new
supply
of
gas,
to
get
an
additional
supply
of
gas.
and
therefore,
the
pipeline
company
does
retain
some
major
of
control
over
what
happens.
now,
when
the
contract
provides
that
the
pipeline
company
has
to
pay
the
producer
more
whenever
it
pays
anybody
else
more
for
its
gas,
then
it
makes
no
difference
whether
there
is
a
new
contract
or
not.
when
the
--
the
second
contract
calls
for
a
higher
price,
then
the
first
contract
automatically
is
raised
or
escalated
up.
and
the
pipeline
company
knows
that
it
is
inevitable
that
it
will
have
to
pay
more
for
gas
because
that
has
been
the
steady
consistent
history
in
the
producing
field
all
this
time
that
the
prices
are
going
up.
and
therefore,
the
pipeline
can
--
can
count
on
having
to
pay
more
and
you
are
taking
away
from
the
pipeline
the
control
which
it
would
have
and
some
of
them
exercise
it,
have
to
stay
out
of
a
field
where
an
escalation
in
it
and
the
price
of
gas
which
it
is
already
purchasing
at
one
rate
would
increase
it
--
its
cost
as
producing
cost
so
much
that
it
cannot
afford
to
do
that.
and
they
need
this
language
in
order
to
protect
them,
the
companies
that
are
buying,
the
pipeline
companies
that
are
buying.
i
--
i
think
myself
as
when
this
court
had
the
memphis
case
before
it
that
this
court
very
definitely
took
the
only
view
which
would
be
reasonable.
you
remember
that
was
whether
--
whether
they
had
a
service
agreement,
where
they
had
a
service
agreement.
the
question
was
whether
that
came
under
the
mobile
doctrine
that
there
could
not
be
a
unilateral
change
just
on
the
part
of
the
pipeline
that
the
customers
--
the
pipeline
had
to
agree.
and
--
and
this
court
said
that
the
service
agreement
differs
from
a
contract.
but
it
went
on
and
--
and
on
page
114
of
358
u.s.,
the
court
says,
"there
remains
the
question
whether
united's
service
agreements
reserved
to
it
the
power
to
make
rate
changes
in
this
manner.
the
commission
found
that
the
agreements
so
intended,
but
on
it's
view
of
the
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
unnecessary
to
decide
the
question.
we
think
it
would
be
both
unnecessary
and
dilatory
for
us
to
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
consideration
of
that
issue,
which
involves
matters
peculiarly
within
the
area
of
the
commission's
special
competence
and
as
to
which
we
could
hardly
be
aided
by
further
examination
of
the
record
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
that
is
putting
to
the
commission
the
responsibility
for
making
the
determination
initially
had
the
third
circuit
then
of
the
opinion
that
the
commission
did
not
make
the
requisite
findings
that
it
should
have
made
and
that
its
expertise
had
not
been
applied,
then
it
should
have
remanded
the
case
to
the
commission
for
a
further
examination
either
on
that
record
or
on
a
--
on
an
additional
record.
but
the
third
circuit
goes
out
and
the
examine
this
merely
on
the
law
of
contracts
and
in
its
analysis,
it
reads
this
language
that
i
read
to
you
from
the
shell
escalation
in
paragraph
3,
and
reads
that
merely
as
saying
that
it
was
a
contract
where
there's
a
new
weren't
old,
that
calls
for
a
higher
price.
then
the
shell
price
automatically
goes
up
and
we
don't
think
the
words
"enter
into
a
contract
for
the
purchase
of
gas"
can
be
so
construed.
there's
--
there's
another
case
which
is
--
is
really
just
as
--
as
significant
as
that
memphis
case
and
--
and
might
refer
to
that
and
that's
the
western
pacific
case
in
352
u.s.
because
in
there,
the
--
the
--
this
court
very
definitely
held
that
the
--
it
was
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
first,
that
they
first
pass
on
a
construction
of
the
tariff.
in
another
case
which
is
somewhat
like
that,
the
far
eastern
conference
case
and
we
refer
the
both
of
these
in
our
--
our
brief,
this
court
referred
to
the
fact
that
in
the
development
of
administrative
law,
chief
justice
white,
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
applied
the
accommodating
complimentary
roles
of
the
court
in
the
--
and
the
administrative
agencies
in
the
enforcement
of
law
to
a
situation
where
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
concurrent
jurisdiction
was
conferred
both
on
the
courts
and
on
the
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
if
the
court
goes
on
and
refer
us
to
the
pioneer
workers
that
chief
justice
white
had
given
in
the
texas
and
pacific
railroad
company
and
then
says
this,
“court
and
agency
are
not
to
be
regarded
as
wholly
independent
and
unrelated
instrumentalities
of
justice,
each
acting
in
the
performance
of
it's
proscribed
statutory
duty
without
regard
to
the
appropriate
function
of
the
other
in
securing
the
plainly
indicated
objects
of
the
statute.”
what
we're
suggesting
to
the
court
is
--
is
simple
--
simply
this,
that
this
court
has
placed
restraints
upon
judicial
review
of
administrative
actions
which
we
think
have
not
been
followed
in
this
present
case
and
we
think
that
they
should
be.
we
think
that
this
case,
by
reason
of
the
large
number
of
escalation
clauses
which
the
commission
must
consider
that
this
case
should
have
a
uniform
and
consistent
application
with
the
other
escalation
clauses
which
are
before
the
court.
thank
you.
