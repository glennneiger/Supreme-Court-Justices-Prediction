is

yes.

it
would
have.

the

reached

conclusion

they
thought

clear
in

justice

but
it
seems
to
me
these
three
tribunals,
the
examiner
and
the
commission
and
the
court,
all
reaching
different
results
or
some
--
or
at
least
two
of
them
reaching
the

result,
somewhat
different
reasons
it
seems
to
me
one
has
to
recognize
this
is
a
debatable
question.
justice

well,
if
it's
a
debatable
question
then,
what
--
where
do
you
think
the
--
where
do
you
think
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
talking
about
the
substantive
issue
as
it
relates
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
commission
here
was
--
the
court
was
entitled
to
override
the
commission.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
claim
that
the
commission
made
any
errors
of
law
other
than
reaching
a
wrong
conclusion
or
did
it
reach
--
reach
the
wrong
conclusion
or
reach
a
conclusion
it
did
by
virtue
of
applying
errors
--
applying
principles
that
you
claimed
were
inadmissible
principles?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
you
one
more
question?
mr.
correa
said
there
were
some
500
of
these
contracts
that
had
clauses
comparable
to
this.
if
i
understood
him
correctly,
does
the
commission
construe
any
of
these
contracts
before?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
regulatory
body,
you
--
my
point
of
my
question
is
uniformity
has
some
--
has
some
factor
in
this
business.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
state
in
two
sentences
what
your
position
would
be
on
this
very
difficult
question,
namely,
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
limits
of
the
court's
powers
in
reviewing
the
limit
--
the
area
within
which
a
court,
as
you
constricted,
in
reviewing
a
determination
of
the
commission
on
an
interpretation
of
a
contract?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
question
of
whether
there
are
particular
matters
in
a
particular
contract
that
calls
for
expertise
in
a
substantial
sense
is
irrelevant
on
your
point
of
view?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
that
if
the
court's
