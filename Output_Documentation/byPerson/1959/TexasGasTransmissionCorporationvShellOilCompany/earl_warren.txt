didn't
the
court
--
didn't
the
court
below
rely
on
the
practice
in
the
trade?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
it
say?
chief

didn't
--
chief

--
didn't
it
say
a
little
more?
chief

didn't
it
say
a
little
more
than
that?
didn't
it
say
that
--
chief

--
than
the
practice
in
the
trade?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
now,
what
did
it
base
that
on?
what
--
chief
justice

warren
--
what
(voice

--
chief
justice

--
in
the
record
--
chief
justice

(voice

--
chief

but
does
--
do
the
words,
do
the
words
show
what
is
the
practice
in
the
trade?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
when
--
so
far
as
the
matter
--
i
thought
they
assume
to
say
what
the
practice
in
the
trade
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'll
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i'll
read
it
again
but
i
--
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
maybe
it's
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
have
--
you
don't
have
to
do
that
for
me.
i
--
i'm
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
familiar
with
that
rule.
i
was
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
was
just
talking
about
the
language
of
the
court
insofar
as
the
practice
of
the
trade
was
concerned
and
whether
or
not
you
rely
it
on
that
and
if
you
did,
what
--
what
evidence
there
was
in
--
in
the
record
that
you
rely
upon
for
that
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
it
wanted
to
accomplish
the
opposite,
why
wouldn't
they
just
say
buyer
agrees
that
if
during
the
term
of
this
--
of
this
contract,
it
purchases
from
producers
in
this
area
any
gas
at
--
at
a
price
exceeding
that
provided
for
in
this
contract
that
the
--
that
the
buyers
would
have
a
benefit
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't
use
that
word.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
said
if
they
--
if
they
purchase
at
a
higher
price
from
any
--
anyone
during
the
life
of
that
contract
in
that
area,
then
--
then
the
purchaser
is
entitled
to
the
--
to
the
benefit
at
a
higher
price.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
were
--
you
were
just
saying
if
they
meant
to
do
the
other,
they
would
have
--
they
would
have
done
what
--
what
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
prescribed.
i
say
why
isn't
just
as
reasonable
to
say
if
they
intended
what
--
what
you
say
that
they
would
have
put
it
in
--
in
this
clear
language
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
that
present
result?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
--
this
is
not
two
people
who
--
who
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
person
and
another
one
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
rather
important
to
the
shell
too,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask
this?
what
--
what
limitations
do
you
concede
this
clause
carries
--
carries
with
it
other
than
one
--
geographical
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
just
--
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
get
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
