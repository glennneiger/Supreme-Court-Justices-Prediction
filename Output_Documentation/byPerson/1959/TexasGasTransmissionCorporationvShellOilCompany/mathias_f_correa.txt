mr.
mathias
f.
correa
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
both
petitioners
in
167,
texas
gas
transmission
co.,
which
is
the
pipeline
involved
in
this
matter,
and
the
louisville
gas
and
electric
company,
which
is
also
a
petitioner
and
which
is
vitally
interested
in
--
in
this
matter
as
a
customer
of
texas
gas
and
as
the
supplier
of
158,000
consumers
of
gas
in
the
louisville
area.
now,
as
mr.
gatchell
very
promptly
pointed
out
yesterday,
the
economics
of
the
natural
gas
industry
demand
long-term
commitments
between
pipeline
companies
on
the
one
hand,
producers
of
gas
on
the
other
for
the
supply
of
gas
primarily
so
that
the
pipeline
companies
may
finance
the
construction,
otherwise,
in
this
case
the
purchase
from
the
government
of
the
pipelines.
now,
because
these
contracts
are
long-term,
and
by
long-term,
i
mean
20
to
25
years,
the
atlantic
contract
here
involved,
for
example,
is
25-year
term,
because
they
are
long-term,
they
usually
contain,
almost
invariably,
one
might
say,
some
form
of
predetermined
redetermination
of
price,
redetermination
in
order
to
take
care
of
economic
change
over
the
long-term
which
regrettably
has
been
mostly
in
a
upward
direction.
predetermined
redetermine
of
price
so
the
parties
are
bound
to
it
either
to
an
absolute
price
increase
or
to
a
standard
from
the
times
when
they
enter
into
the
contracts.
now,
if
the
court
please,
this
--
the
long-term
character
of
these
contracts
accounts
as
well
for
the
presence
in
them
of
what
is
called
loosely
in
the
trade
as
most
“favored-nation”
clauses.
this
term
could
be
misleading
because
it
does
not,
in
the
natural
gas
industry,
mean
necessarily
as
it
might
in,
for
example,
of
the
patent
licensing
field
or
some
other
field
that
the
pipeline
company
will
pay
the
producer
in
whose
contract
that
term
appears,
the
highest
price
that
it
is
paying
or
does
pay
to
any
other
producer.
rather,
the
term
is
more
properly
or
the
clause
is
more
properly
called
as
the
commission
called
it
here
a
price
escalation
provision
which
provides
for
the
increase
in
price
upon
the
occurrence
of
a
specified
event.
and
the
specified
event
is
the
subject
of
bargaining
in
contract
between
the
parties.
now,
there
are
two
such
clauses
which
have
been
referred
to
in
this
record.
the
first
is
the
clause
that
appears
in
the
atlantic
contract.
and
that
--
there,
the
event
which
triggers,
as
they
put
it,
the
escalation
into
the
shell
contract
rather
it's
the
--
it's
the
clause
that
appears
in
the
shell
contract,
i
misspoke
myself.
and
there,
the
event
which
triggers
the
escalation
in
price
is
entry
into
a
new
contract
for
the
purchase
of
gas.
now,
i
am
aware
that
mr.
justice
whittaker
quite
correctly
pointed
out
yesterday
that
the
word
“new”
does
not
appear
in
the
clause.
and
that
is
right.
but
if
we
turn
to
the
record
where
the
full
clause
in
question
appears
at
pages
66
to
67
is
clause
3.
at
the
bottom
of
66,
we
will
see
immediately
what
--
why
we
call
it
“new”
contract
for
the
purchase
of
gas
at
a
higher
price
because
our
clause
begins,
bottom
of
66,
if,
at
anytime
after
december
31,
1951,
buyer
shall
enter,
that's
the
pipeline,
into
a
contract
providing
for
the
purchase
of
it
by
gas
produced
in
a
certain
place
etcetera
at
a
higher
price,
then
the
price
under
this
contract
is
increased
accordingly.
and
you
will
note
the
further
provision,
in
the
last
sentence
of
this
clause
which
says
that
in
determining
whether
the
price
payable
under
such
other,
i
would
say,
new
contract
but
post
1951
contract
in
my
--
would
satisfy
the
argument
just
as
well,
this
such
other
post
1951
contract,
due
consideration
shall
be
given
to
the
provisions
of
the
contract
--
of
this
contract
as
compared
with
the
other
as
to
quality,
delivery
pressures,
gathering
and
compressing
arrangements,
quantity
and
other
pertinent
factors.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
i
believe
it
is,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
there
are
several
forms
actually.
and
as
the
record
here
reflects
and
also
as
is
reflected
in
the
--
in
the
petitions
for
rehearing
--
for
certiorari
and
particularly
our
reply
petition,
there
are
quite
a
few
different
forms
in
use
in
--
in
the
trade.
and
i
may
say,
if
your
honor
please,
that
where
the
party
is
meant,
the
escalation
to
be
triggered
by
a
payment
simply
of
a
higher
price
under
an
existing
contract,
they
said
so.
and
this
is
the
point
which
the
commission
made
in
denying
rehearing.
in
the
proceeding
before
the
commission,
the
commission
said
why
shell
when
they
mean
that,
say
it
and
cited
and
quoted
two
or
three
shell
escalation
clauses
of
that
kind.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
i
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
that
is
so,
if
your
honor
please,
nor
--
nor
do
i
believe
the
record
discloses
that
one
way
or
the
other.
now,
if
the
court
please.
now,
let
me
against
that
brief
background
turn
to
this
question
of
expertise
upon
which
mr.
justice
harlan
commented
yesterday.
now,
we
submit,
let
me
put
it
that
way,
that
the
error
of
the
court
below
were
consistent
not
simply
in
failing
to
give
weight
to
the
commission's
expertise
because
the
court
below
went
further
and
made
its
own
finding
as
to
the
usual
objective,
and
i'm
using
their
words,
“in
the
trade”,
their
words
again,
“of
these
clauses”.
most
“favored-nation”
clauses
had
gone
on
rating
all
types
of
most
“favored-nation”
clauses.
in
these,
the
court
found
that
this
usual
objective
in
the
trade
was
to
assure
the
seller
a
top
price
for
its
gas.
now,
on
the
basis
of
this
finding,
the
court
went
on
to
conclude
that
the
redetermination
of
price
by
the
parties
to
the
atlantic
contract
under
that
contract
would
constitute
entry
into
a
contract
for
the
purchase
of
gas,
and
now
i
quote
significant
words
because
the
court
qualified
their
finding
this
way,
“at
least,
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
the
favored-nation
clause”.
and
the
court
emphasizes
by
finding
that
this
would
be
so
whether
the
price
redetermination
was
determined
by
agreement
of
the
parties
as
to
controlling
facts
upon
which
price
depended,
which
is
what
happened
here
under
the
atlantic
contract,
all
by
arbitration
to
which
the
parties
had
bound
themselves
when
they
originally
entered
the
contract.
now,
the
court,
we
submit,
does
not
only
ignored
the
commission's
expertise
but
indeed
assumed
to
itself
expertise
in
a
field
in
which
the
commission's
statutory
duties,
responsibilities
and
functions
served
by
all
rights
make
them
better
qualified.
now,
this
highlights,
if
the
court
please,
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
query,
which,
in
substance,
i
may
not
have
the
words
exactly
right,
i
--
i
remember
as
being,
if
the
contract
is
clear
on
its
face
is
to
be
construed
according
to
its
plain
language,
why
is
there
a
necessity
for
resort
to
expertise?
and
the
answer
precisely
is
that
the
commission
at
least
had
the
expertise
which
enabled
it
to
know
that
there
wasn't
any
usual
objective
of
escalation
clauses
“in
the
trade”
which
required
that
construction
in
this
manner,
at
least
for
purposes
of
most
“favored-nation”
clause.
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
feel
that
the
learned
court
below
also
erred
in
basing
its
decision
upon
a
finding
of
fact
made
by
the
court
independently
of
the
commission
as
to
the
intention
of
the
parties
to
the
shell
contract
in
the
negotiation
of
that
contract.
now,
as
i
replied
brief
points
out
at
pages
5
to
6,
the
court's
finding
was
in
fact
based
on
testimony
which
was
in
any
event,
incompetent
under
the
parole
evidence
rules
because
it
was
the
testimony
of
the
unilateral
understanding
of
one
party
as
to
what
the
clause
meant
not
communicated
to
the
other.
but
more
important
than
that
point
is
it
that
if
the
court
below
felt
that
the
shell
contract
needed
parole
evidence
for
its
construction,
the
court
should,
under
the
unbroken
line
of
authorities,
have
set
the
case
back
to
the
commission
with
the
direction
to
take
evidence
and
make
findings
on
that
subject.
now,
we
don't
suggest
that
the
contract
needs
parole
evidence.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
understand
--
and
--
and
if
your
honor
would
turn
to
page
163
of
the
record,
you
can
see
right
there
exactly
what
they
did.
and
i
reply
to
the
part
of
the
last
paragraph
ending
on
the
page
following
the
folio
178
notation,
and
--
and
just
before
that,
“because
of
the
difficulty
in
establishing
price
for
so
long
a
period,
the
clause
in
question
was
agreed
upon.
it
appears
that
at
the
time
of
contracting
shell,
louisiana
was
purchasing
from
atlantic
but
not
familiar
with
the
specific
term.”
these
facts
stand
strongly.
now,
those
facts
are
based
on
testimony
on
the
record.
and
as
i
say,
it's
incompetent
testimony
at
best.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
that's
finding.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
i
--
i
believe
it
would
fall
under
the
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine,
although
i
don't
believe
we
need
to
wrestle
with
the
problems
of
those
authorities
in
---
in
this
connection
but
i
do
believe
it
falls
under
those
authorities,
yes,
under
your
--
the
western
pacific
case,
for
example,
as
the
authority
that
comes
from
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
we
cite
them
in
support
of
the
proposition
of
--
of
limited
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
--
judicial
review
which
i
do
believe
they
--
they
hand
a
support.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
i
--
i
think
it's
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
right,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
may
i
say
that
if
we
take
the
word
of
the
third
circuit
point,
this
is
a
case
which
requires
reference
to
the
usual
objectors
of
these
clauses
in
the
trade.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
that
is
correct,
sir.
and
may
i
--
may
i
clear
what
--
what
i'm
saying
which
is
almost
a
form
of
negative
expertise,
if
you
will,
that's
a
poor
description,
i'm
afraid,
but
the
--
the
commission
is
in
a
position
to
know
whether
there
is
a
--
understanding
or
practice
in
the
trade
which
controls
interpretations
of
these
clauses
or
whether
there
isn't.
and
if
the
commission
finds
there
isn't,
well,
then
--
then
the
clauses
are
--
are
construed
according
to
their
plain
language
but
may
be
a
need
to
go
the
commission
to
find
that
out
in
the
first
instance
because
that's
where
their
expertise
precisely
comes
into
play.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
that's
--
that's
my
point
exactly,
if
your
honor
please.
and
i
think
if
this
is
a
case
rather
like
the
memphis
case
where
you
are
dealing
with
a
contract
and
the
rate
schedule
or
contract
operating
as
a
rate
schedule.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
no,
sir.
i
said
that
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
--
it
certainly
is
one
used
by
the
--
by
the
commission
and
that
i
--
i
thought
that
the
--
precisely
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
did
show,
and
i'm
not
sure
it's
otherwise
in
the
record,
that
the
--
this
type
of
limitation
is
limitation
to
a
future
contract
now
appears
in
580
other
rate
schedules.
now,
i
take
that
the
court
can
judicially
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
now,
it
is
to
that
extent,
typical.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
i
thought
that
is
--
i
think
that's
best
so
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
500
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
the
--
the
answer
is
580
because
that's
based
on
the
records
of
the
commission
which
i
take
it
out
at
least
in
theory
before
this
court.
now,
if
the
court
please,
may
i
turn
to
this
question
of
price
under
the
atlantic
contract
and
what
the
parties
did
in
february
1954.
the
court
below
in
regarding
that
failed
to
differentiate,
we
submit,
into
the
difference
or
differentiate
between
entry
into
a
new
contract
that
is
opposed
1951
contract
and
a
redetermination
of
price
under
a
preexisting
i.e.pre
1951
contract
pursuant
to
a
predetermined
standard
contained
in
such
preexisting
contract.
now,
i
shall
here
concedes
implicitly
to
be
sure
but
unmistakably
that
the
letter
would
not
trigger
the
escalation
clause
of
the
shell
contract
but
it
argues
strenuously
that
that
the
price
provisions
of
the
atlantic
contract
were
not
a
true
price
redetermination
clause.
in
fact,
shell
goes
so
far
to
say
--
as
--
to
say
that
the
commission
did
not
so
hold
despite
the
clear
holding
of
the
commission
and
shell's
own
specific
exception
to
that
holding.
nevertheless,
the
contract,
in
fact,
did
contain
a
specific
standard
which
was
prevailing
prices
in
southwestern
louisiana.
now,
most
importantly
than
the
contract
provision,
the
parties
themselves,
and
this
is
shown
by
undisputed
testimony
in
the
record,
the
parties
themselves
regarded
the
contract
as
containing
a
standard
which
was
binding
on
them.
this
came
out
in
the
testimony
of
the
atlantic
man
who
negotiated
the
agreement
of
--
of
february
1954
and
who
said
that
in
reaching
that
letter
agreement,
the
parties
both
understood
that
all
they
were
doing
was
trying
to
agree
on
a
fact,
which
was
controlling
as
the
price,
the
fact
being
prevailing
prices
in
southwestern
louisiana,
and
he
said,
“once
we
agreed
on
prevailing
price,
that
was
it.”
that's
what
the
contract
said.
now,
further
than
that,
the
contemporaneous
written
record
shows
that
during
the
period
between
august
1953
and
february
1954,
the
parties
were
exchanging
elaborate
computations
and
tabulations
of
prices
in
southwestern
louisiana
aimed
at
being
evidentiary
of
the
controlling
fact
which
control
--
which
was
the
standard
of
the
contract.
and
your
honors
can
find
those
at
38
to
45
of
the
record.
now,
as
judge
learned
hand
pointed
out
(inaudible)
v.
clark
which
we've
cited
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
8,
a
standard
--
a
contract
is
not
invalid
because
it
contains
or
even
depends
upon
the
application
of
a
standard
which
is
difficult
to
apply
provided
there
is,
as
there
was
here,
judge
learned
hand
says
a
standard
which
is
quote
“independent
of
the
will,
wish
or
want
of
the
parties”.
now,
actually,
prevailing
prices
in
a
particular
area
is
not
an
unusual
standard
in
the
natural
gas
industry
and
has
been
recognized
and
validated
as
a
valid
standard
of
price
redetermination
by
at
least
one
court,
the
tenth
circuit.
further,
and
this
is
very
important,
this
standard
was
backed
up
by
an
arbitration
provision
so
that
if
the
parties
couldn't
agree
on
the
fact
on
the
application
of
this
standard,
it
was
nevertheless
to
be
fixed
by
arbitration.now,
if
the
court
please,
let
me
come
to
one
last
point.
mr.
justice
whittaker
asked
yesterday,
was
the
letter
of
february
1954
a
contract
or
perhaps,
was
it
a
contract
for
the
purchase
of
gas?
because
those
are
significantly
different.
even
if
it
was
a
contract,
was
it
a
contract
for
the
purchase
of
gas,
and
we
submit
it
was
not
because
a
contract
for
the
purchase
of
gas
and
shell's
own
escalation
clause
shows,
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
must
contained
provisions
as
to
quantity
quite
as
important
term
in
this
contract's
price,
quality,
delivery
arrangements
and
a
host
of
other
as
the
clause
says
pertinent
fact.
these
are
none
of
these
aren't
contained
in
that
letter
of
february
1954
nor
does
it
purport
to
contain
them
or
incorporate
them
by
reference
rather
it
says
we
have
agreed
on
price
for
the
next
five
years
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
condition
3
or
article
iii
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
--
of
our
conduct.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
from
shell
or
atlantic,
sir?
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
if
we
impose
1951?
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
certainly.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
it
just
has
to
be
a
new
contract.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
that's
--
that's
the
(inaudible)
now,
if
the
court
please.
finally,
may
i
say
this
last
point
is
important
because
it
highlights
what
the
court
below,
paying
with
great
respect
to
the
atlantic
court,
only
lip
service,
call
the
realities
of
the
situation
because
the
realities
of
this
situation
whether
the
parties
to
the
atlantic
contract
had
and
understood
they
had
a
binding
contract
for
the
purchase
and
sale
of
gas
over
a
25-year
period
in
specified
quantities
of
a
specified
quality
with
specified
arrangements
for
delivery
etcetera
and
that
neither
party
to
that
contract
by
failing
or
refusing
to
agree
on
the
application
of
the
price
standard
it
contain,
“evade”
or
“frustrates”
the
obligations
of
the
contract.
and
in
closing,
may
i
submit
that
i
suggest
shell
understood
it
that
way
too
and
that
accounts
for
the
abundance
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
which
i
shall
have
not
time
to
rebuff
that
shell
didn't
take
this
claim
very
seriously.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
if
your
honors
please
--
if
your
honors
please.
two
points
very
briefly.
number
one,
despite
all
the
argument
that
has
been,
it
now
emerges
that
there
is
no
substantial
dispute
between
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
as
to
the
clause
of
the
shell
contract.
both
agree
that
he
calls
for
a
post
1951
contract.
both
agree
that
it
calls
for
a
contract
for
the
purchase
of
gas.
both
agree
that
it
calls
for
a
contract
containing
--
containing
terms
as
to
quantity,
quality,
etc.
so
the
real
question
here
is
as
to
what
was
done
under
the
atlantic
contract
as
to
which
(inaudible)
has
been
addressed
except
by
myself?
and
i
note
that
the
one
thing
that
the
counsel
did
say
is
he
said,
“well,
they
haggled
back
and
forth
and
agreed
on
a
price
and
this
is
what
the
witness
testified
to.”
and
that
is
precisely
not
what
he
testified
to
with
great
respect.
he
testified
that
“we
haggled
back
and
forth
and
agreed
on
what
prevailing
prices
were,”
the
--
i.e.the
standard
of
the
contract.
and
once
we
had
agreed
on
that,
that
was
it.
and
further,
the
contract
as
the
commission
points
up,
the
commission
dealt
with
this
and
the
commission
said,
“well,
whether
the
--
the
standard
in
the
contract
was
definite
enough
or
not,
we
need
not
consider
because
it
was
backed
up
by
an
arbitration
clause,”
which
meant
that
the
standard
--
the
applicability
of
the
standard
was
assured
in
any
event
whether
the
parties
agreed
on
its
applicability
or
didn't.
now,
we
submit
the
authority's
allegiant
for
such
a
contract
as
our
binding
contract
on
both
parties
and
binding
not
from
the
time
when
they
applied
their
standard
as
called
for
by
the
contract
that
binding
ab
initio
from
the
--
to
the
original
entry
into
the
contract.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
if
it
is
a
reasonable
interpretation,
the
court,
as
i
understand
the
rules
of
judicial
review
in
--
in
this
situation,
is
bound
to
affirm
it.
it
does
not
have
to
be
the
reasonable
interpretation
in
the
sense
that
the
court
would
say,
“if
we
were
considering
the
matter
de
novo,
this
is
the
interpretation
we
would
put
up.”
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
no,
sir.
i
--
i
believe
that
that
goes
to
the
question
of
reasonableness
which
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
--
might
exposes.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
--
it's
--
it
--
no,
it's
a
question
of
perfectly
practical
matter.
the
commissioner
who's
been
sitting
--
or
this
commission
which
has
been
dealing
with
these
contracts
for
20
years
can't
take
all
of
its
expertise
when
it
has
a
particular
one
before
it
like
a
man
would
shed
his
coat,
their
expertise
necessarily
as
part
of
their
equipment.
they've
seen
these
contracts
over
the
years.
they've
been
dealing
with
them.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
yes,
if
your
honor
please.
actually,
it's
smaller.
i
believe
it's
38,
it
goes
back.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
have
one
--
only
one
other
point,
which
i
think
my
other
client,
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
louisville
gas
and
electric
company
would
like
me
to
make.
there
has
been
much
said
about
how
the
limitation
of
these
clauses
benefits
pipeline
companies.
well,
that's
true,
but
my
client
--
my
other
client
would
like
me
also
to
point
out
the
benefits
to
the
consuming
public.
thank
you.
