justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
the
letter
of
february
17,
1954
fixing
the
price
of
september
1
preceding.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
new?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
gatchell
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please,
sir?
were
the
provisions
at
that
letter
of
february
17,
1954,
in
your
judgement
a
contract
for
the
purchase
of
gas?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
in
the
absence
of
that
letter,
suppose
it
had
not
been
made,
would
there
then
have
been
an
existing
contract
for
the
purchase
of
gas
by
texas
from
shell?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
noticed
here
there
is
--
doesn't
appear
to
be
any
provision
saying
that
the
price
in
existence
and
the
--
during
the
preceding
five-year
term
shall
continue
until
a
new
one
is
arranged.
there
just
isn't
any
price
after
the
end
of
the
five-year
period,
until
one
is
made.
is
that
not
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
that
word
"new"
in
here
anywhere
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
in
there,
in
this
contract?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
it
maybe
be
convenient
to
add,
answer
in
the
same
time,
why
is
it
necessary
to
add
words?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
--
do
you
understand
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
did
or
that
they
gave
heed
to
parole
evidence
or
that
they
merely
construed
the
terms
of
the
contract?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
did
they
do
anymore?
isn't
that
all
they
did?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then,
if
they
did
it,
couldn't
there
be
a
review
of
their
judgment
on
that
question
of
law
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
is
the
court
of
appeals
rubber-stamped?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
at
all
events,
congress
has
provided
for
judicial
review
of
commission
orders.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
if
there's
anything
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
review,
it's
the
correctness
of
determinations
not
involving
facts
but
those
subject
to
decision
only
as
once
of
law
or
by
the
court.
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
in
this
case,
can
you
tell
us
with
assurance,
did
the
commission
contend
that
there
was
some
special
significance
to
be
given
to
these
words
in
the
trade
or
did
it
just
interpret
these
contracts
on
their
plain
ordinary
meaning
of
the
words?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
the
--
isn't
that
the
only
way
we
have
to
determine
what
it
give
consideration
to,
that
is
from
what
it
said?
