mr.
oliver
l.
stone
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
judicial
review
issue,
we
believe
this
case
resolves
itself
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
federal
power
commission
was
better
qualified
than
the
court
of
appeals
to
read
the
everyday
language
appearing
in
a
privately
negotiated
contract.
the
considerations
of
which
the
petitioners
now
urge
in
support
of
the
commission's
order
were
not
the
considerations,
were
not
the
factors
upon
which
the
commission
itself
based
that
order.
what
was
the
issue
in
this
case
and
how
did
it
arrives
and
how
did
the
commission
treat
it?
the
issue
in
this
case
was
what
contract
price
had
the
parties
fixed
for
themselves
as
of
the
critical
date,
june
7,
1954.
that
was
the
question.
that
was
the
issue.
the
issue
in
this
case
in
no
way
involved
the
lawfulness
of
that
price.
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
price
was
not
involved
as
it
would
have
been
had
this
been
a
rate
proceeding
under
either
section
4
(e)
or
section
5
(a)
of
the
gas
act.
the
federal
power
commission,
unlike
in
the
memphis
case,
had
no
part
in
the
formulation
of
the
contract
which
it
construed.
this
was
not
a
case
in
which
the
producer
was
seeking
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
hence,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
price
was
in
the
public
convenience
of
necessity
was
not
at
issue.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
had
issued
a
certificate
to
shell
in
1946,
which
was
the
year
before
this
proceeding
--
this
hearing
was
held
before
the
commission.
the
question
which
the
commission
set
for
itself
in
our
view
was
in
no
way
intermixed
with
any
question
that
was
peculiarly
administrative.
any
question
as
to
which
the
commission
had
a
unique
expertise
or
know-how
to
bring
into
play
that
were
not
possessed
by
courts.
the
shell
clause,
we
claimed,
your
honors,
is
clear.
the
words
are
implied
in
their
ordinary
sense.
there
are
no
technical
words
used.
there
are
no
words
of
art.
furthermore,
in
the
resolution
of
this
issue,
the
federal
power
commission
did
not
draw
upon
its
undrstanding
of
any
industry
usage
or
any
industry
practice.
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
that
effect.
since,
as
we
contend,
the
words
in
this
privately
negotiated
contract
were
used
in
their
normal
ordinary
non-technical
sense,
we
submit
that
the
issue
before
the
commission
was
one
purely
of
law.
that's
all
the
issue
called
for.
that's
all
it
received.
and
furthermore
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
mean,
your
honor,
and
i
was
just
going
to
cite
that
under
the
decision
in
the
merchants'
elevator
and
other
cases
following
that,
when
words
used
in
a
tariff
or
used
in
their
ordinary
sense,
as
justice
brandeis
said
in
that
case.
he
said
their
construction
presents
solely
a
question
of
law.
now,
it's
true
that
the
court
then
went
on
to
say
that
there
are
cases
in
these
railroad
tariffs
where
words
may
be
used
in
a
peculiar
sense.
and
when
that
isn't
issued
or
when
words
are
so
used,
then
it
is
proper
for
the
court
to
refer
that
matter
to
the
administrative
agency
under
the
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine.
i
would
concede
that
perhaps
literally,
what
words
mean
might
be
a
question
of
fact.
but
i
am
content,
we
are,
in
this
case,
to
rest
our
position
upon
what
this
court
has
said
that
when
the
construction
involves
only
words
used
in
their
ordinary
sense,
then
the
question
presented
is
one
solely
of
law
for
the
court
just
as
the
construction
of
any
other
written
document.
now,
that
case
dealt
with
the
railroad
tariff.
so
the
more
so,
we
say,
should
that
doctrine
apply
in
this
case
where
you
had
a
privately
negotiated
contract
entered
into
even
prior
to
the
time
that
the
commission
began
exercising
jurisdiction
over
producers.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
your
honor,
in
this
case,
had
there
been
back
history
in
the
trade,
i
feel
rather
confident,
there
would
have
been
something
either
in
the
record
to
show
it
or
that
the
commission
somewhere
in
its
order
would
have
mentioned
that.
i
say
that
because
if
the
commission
were
in
effect
taking
official
notice
of
a
given
industry
practice,
then
i,
the
other
party
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
or
commission
construction,
yes,
your
honor.
i
should
have
the
opportunity
to
show
that
the
commission
that
that
practice
is
not
so.
and
i
think
section
7
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
afford
me
that
right.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
your
honor,
i
think
my
answer
to
that
question
is
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
think
the
court
below
did
say
that
the
usual
objective,
the
usual
objective
of
these
clauses
is
to
give
the
seller
a
top
price.
it
also
referred
to
the
circumstances
and
the
situation
of
the
parties
surrounding
the
execution
of
the
contract.
it
showed
that
the
pipeline
wanted
a
long-term
contract
and
the
court
did
say,
your
honor,
that
these
facts
would
tend
to
indicate
that
the
intention
of
the
parties
to
the
shell
contract
was
that
shell's
price
would
increase
every
time
the
pipeline
paid
a
higher
price
except
possibly,
the
court
said,
in
the
event
one
of
these
fixed
step
up
clauses.
our
position
in
that
regard
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
your
honor
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
sir?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
it
went
on
later
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
it
--
it
said,
your
honor,
in
the
trade,
this
--
these
clauses,
the
usual
objective
of
these
clauses
is
to
give
the
seller
a
top
price.
that's
on
page
163
of
the
record.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
they
based
that
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
your
honor
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
of
--
well,
there
was
testimony
by
the
shell
witness
who
negotiated
this
contract
showing
what
--
at
least
what
he
wanted.
now,
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
here
was
applying
the
usual
rules
of
construction
of
the
written
word.
the
court
here
was
not
going
outside
of
the
written
word.
the
court
of
--
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
the
federal
power
commission
nor
the
examiner
found
that
the
words
in
the
shell
contract
were
ambiguous.
and
that,
i
believe,
is
the
crux
of
the
problem
that
the
counsel
was
just
speaking
about.
you
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
no,
your
honor,
but
it
is
an
established
rule
of
construction
even
where
words
are
not
ambiguous
that
the
court
can
place
itself
in
the
position
of
the
parties
and
it
can
look
at
the
surrounding
circumstances
and
it
can
look
at
the
object
and
the
purpose
of
it.
that's
all
the
court
of
appeals
was
doing.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
no,
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
was
saying
there
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
certainly.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
and
i
wish
your
honor
would
read
it
with
--
with
that
in
mind
that
a
court
even
in
any
case,
evidence
is
admissible
and
the
court
is
entitled
to
consider
any
evidence
in
the
record,
showing
the
surrounding
circumstances
and
the
object
which
the
parties
meant
to
attain.
now,
professor
williston,
i
think,
mentions
that
and
--
and
points
out
the
--
the
distinction
that
he
--
he
says
it's
quite
often
overlook,
and
i
think
it's
rather
important
in
this
case.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
all
right,
sir.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
showing
the
usual
objective
of
these
clauses
as
a
general
proposition.
there
is
evidence
in
this
record
showing
the
objective
which
shell
attempted
to
attain
by
this
clause.
now,
your
honor,
we
--
there
is
evidence
that
this
court
can
take
judicial
knowledge
of,
that
is
before
the
congressional
committees
where
they
point
out
the
--
they
don't
point
out
what
the
usual
objective
of
these
clauses
is
but
they
point
out
what
the
usual
clauses
are.
now,
i
further
submit,
your
honor,
that
there
is
nothing
inherently
wrong
or
wrong
in
any
way.
what
a
court
mentioning
in
passing
what
it
considers
to
be
the
usual
objective
of
a
price
escalation
clause.
i
submit
it
can
have
no
other
purpose
than
to
give
the
seller
a
higher
price.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
your
honor
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
that's
correct.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
right.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
correct,
your
honor.
might
i
say
about
three
things
in
connection
with
that.
first
of
all,
this
case
went
first
to
the
federal
power
commission.
this
is
not
a
case
of
primary
jurisdiction
where
the
suit
was
first
filed
in
court
and
then
the
question
arose
as
to
jurisdiction.
this
question
was
here
before
the
commission.
it
construed
by
trying
to
interpret
the
language
of
these
words
on
the
face
of
the
words.
it's
been
through
the
commission
but
more
important,
speaking
of
this
being
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
certainly.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
that's
all
they
did.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
think
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
i
think
it
presents
purely
a
question
of
law.
the
court
of
appeals
could
review
it
as
a
question
of
law.
and
when
so
doing,
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
would
apply
the
usual
rules
of
construction
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
now,
but
i
--
i'd
like
to
finish
answering
your
question,
your
honor.
speaking
about
the
policy
here,
the
policy
of
the
natural
gas
act
is
that
parties
still
have
the
right
to
make
private
contracts.
now,
your
honor,
tariffs
were
on
file
with
the
--
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
years
and
years.
when,
in
1922,
this
case
--
this
court
decided
merchants'
elevator
and
it
said
“even
though
this
is
a
tariff,
yet,
since
the
words
are
used
only
in
their
normal
ordinary
sense,
we,
the
court,
can
read
them
just
as
well
as
anyone
else.”
and
in
1937,
they
said
the
same
thing
in
the
brown
&
sons
lumber
company
case
which
actually,
your
honor,
was
a
judicial
review
case.
now,
merchants'
elevator
in
1922
was
a
case
of
primary
jurisdiction.
but
the
brown
&
sons
lumber
case,
and
these
cases
are
cited
and
discussed
in
our
brief.
it
was
actually
a
--
a
judicial
review
case.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
that's
absolute
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
your
honor,
that
is
true
in
some
cases.
and
maybe,
i
can
partly
answer
your
question
by
saying
what
we
do
not
contend
for
in
this
case.
we
do
not
contend
that
every
time
a
federal
administrative
agency
resolves
a
question
which
might
be
classified
as
one
of
law,
that
its
conclusion
is
fully
judicially
reviewable.
we
do
not
contend
that.
and
i
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
western
pacific
case
probably
indicates
that
you
can.
our
position
is
this.
when
a
matter
goes
first
to
the
federal
power
commission
or
any
other
administrative
agency,
and
when
that
matter
involves
a
question
of
law
and
when
the
federal
agency
views
it
as
such
and
decides
it
as
it
thought
a
court
would
have
decided
it
and
bases
its
conclusion
upon
court
decisions
and
does
not
bring
into
play
and
not
does
the
issue
permit
the
bringing
into
play
of
specialized
issues,
then
we
believe
the
agency's
finding
is
fully
and
completely
reviewable
by
the
court.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
there
isn't
any
question
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
traditionally
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
unquestionably,
that
--
that's
true,
your
honor.
for
years,
it's
been
a
question
for
the
court
and
not
to
the
jury
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
yes.
but
the
fact
remains
no
matter
what
you
call
it.
this
was
a
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
determine.
i
--
i'm
not
set
on
calling
it
law
of
fact
or
anything
else
but
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
think
it's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
in
fact,
one
of
our
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
---
points
in
here
is
not
reasonable.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
hope
i'm
consistent.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
[laughs]
with
reference
to
the
memphis
case
that
this
court
decided
1958,
your
honors,
i
shall
not
presume
to
persuade
this
court
what
it
meant
when
it
so
recently
decided
that
case.
if
what
this
court
held
in
the
memphis
case
controls
this
case,
then
just
so
be
it.
there's
nothing
i
can
do
about
that.
all
i
can
give
is
my
understanding
of
it.
now,
i'd
give
it
very
briefly.
in
the
memphis
case,
as
i
read
it
and
as
i
read
the
briefs,
it
seems
to
me
that
there,
the
federal
power
commission
construed
language
which
in
effect
it
had
written
itself.
this
court
then
said
that
was
a
matter
within
the
special
competence
of
the
commission.
but
even
then,
this
court
went
on
to
say
that
we
have
scrutinized
the
record
and
we
find
the
commission's
conclusion
to
be
aptly
supported
both
factually
and
legally.
that's
all
i
can
say
about
memphis.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
he
did,
yes,
your
honor.
the
examiner
held
that
the
atlantic
pipeline
agreement
of
february
1954
did
activate
the
shell
clause.
in
fact,
he
said
that
the
words
are
just
so
clear.
to
miss
their
meaning
is
just
to
disregard
the
--
the
words
of
the
english
language.
he
held
for
shell
in
effect.
the
federal
power
commission
reversed
his
holding.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
but
now,
you
see
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
--
i
want
to
come
to
that
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
but
--
but
this
is
a
good
time.
it
is
the
question
of
their
saying
the
words
were
so
clear.
they
--
as
i
see
the
commission's
order,
they
read
into
this
shell
clause
the
word
“new”
and
that
was
bad
enough.
but
then,
when
they
got
to
looking
at
this
other
contract,
the
contract
between
atlantic
and
the
pipeline
that
was
made
in
1954,
then
they
said
that
was
not
a
new
contract.
it
was
merely
action
taken
pursuant
to
a
preexisting
contract.
hence,
it
did
not
activate
the
shell
clause.
well,
i
--
i'll
show
in
a
moment,
i
hope.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
there
isn't
any
question
about
it.
certainly
it's
debatable.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
you're
speaking
now
in
the
judicial
review
issue
of
the
substantive
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
it
is
a
debatable
issue,
your
honor.
it's
not
the
resolution
of
every
debatable
issue
that
gives
finality
to
the
administrative
finding.if
that
were
the
case,
to
me,
judicial
review
wouldn't
mean
very
much.
now,
i
grant
you
that
where
the
commission
under
section
19
(b)
of
the
gas
act,
where
the
commission
makes
a
finding
of
fact
that
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
that
may
be
conclusive.
but
if
we
are
correct
in
our
major
premise
that
this
was
a
question,
a
judicial
question,
let
us
put
it
that
way
instead
of
a
question
of
law,
that
--
it's
a
judicial
question.
the
--
the
examiner
who
was
a
lawyer
construed
it
one
way.
the
federal
power
commission
looked
at
it.
it
construed
it
in
another
way.
the
court
of
appeals
read
it
and
it
construed
it
another
way.
but
it
was
a
question
of
law
and
the
way
the
administrative
agency
conclude
--
construed
it
was
reviewable
by
the
court.
and
it
--
as
i
started
out,
it
comes
down
to
a
question
of
who
is
better
qualified
to
read
these
things.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
certainly
admit
that
to
reasonable
men
or
reasonable
minds
might
read
it
different
way..
i
--
i
can't
read
it
that
way.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
they
misconceive
the
law,
your
honor.
i
think,
first
of
all,
they
misread
the
shell
contract.
but
primarily,
they
said
this
other
contract
in
effect
was
not
a
new
contract
as
they
put
it
but
was
merely
action
taken
pursuant
to
an
old
contract.
now,
on
the
substantive
issue
here,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
under
the
shell
clause
as
we
read
it.
how
the
other
contract
comes
about
whether
it
results
from
an
old
contract
or
a
new
contract
or
anything
else,
the
clause
provides
that
if,
after
this
given
date,
the
buyer
shall
enter
into
a
contract
providing
for
the
purchase
by
if
--
of
gas
within
a
given
field
at
a
--
and
if
the
price
thereunder
is
higher,
she
is
entitled
to
it.
i
believe,
your
honors,
that
atlantic
and
the
pipeline
could
have
had
a
firm
contract
over
here
for
20
years,
let's
say,
and
had
a
fixed
price
for
20
years.
and
in
1954,
atlantic
may
have
written
to
the
pipeline
for
reasons
of
their
own.
they
said,
“well,
this
fixed
price
isn't
right.
let's
sit
down
and
see
if
we
can
negotiate
a
new
price.”
and
they
got
together
and
they
negotiated
a
new
price.
that,
to
me,
would
be
entry
into
a
contract
providing
for
the
purchase
of
gas
at
a
higher
price.
and
we
submit
that
is
what
the
shell
clause
means.
and
if
it's
not
so
construed,
one
of
its
principal
purposes
is
defeated.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
it
did.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
precisely.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
think
in
that
case,
we
might
have
a
different
situation,
your
honor.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
precisely.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
precisely.
if
i
might
pass
now
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
excuse
me.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
do
not
know
of
any
order
or
decision
by
the
commission
construing
a
clause
like
this.
there
are
two
cases
that
went
to
the
tenth
circuit
dealing
with
escalation
clauses
but
they
dealt
with
something
else.
your
honor,
i
--
i
hesitate
to
say
they
have
never
done
it.
they
may
well
have.
as
far
as
i
know,
they
have
not
construed
this
clause.
now,
there
may
be
some
clauses
in
the
general
arena
of
this
that
they've
dealt
with,
but
sorry,
i
--
i
just
don't
know.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
uniformity
is
unquestionably
a
factor.
but,
your
honor,
as
to
uniformity,
when
it's
a
question
of
law,
and
here,
again,
i
refer
and
--
and
think
our
case
is
within
the
principle
of
the
merchants'
elevator
case,
uniformity,
when
your
concerned
with
--
with
questions
of
law
is
a
matter
that
can
be
fixed
by
this
court
because
that
question
can
come
here.
so
there
may
be
any
(inaudible).
i
know
there
are
thousands
upon
thousands
of
contracts
with
the
federal
power
commission.
but
actually
on,
as
i
view
it,
it's
just
as
important
to
have
the
--
the
courts
review
the
commission's
conclusion
and
it
might
be
more
so
when
there
are
all
of
these
clauses
than
if
there
were
not
any.
well,
maybe
one
or
two.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
certainly.
it
seems
that
way
to
me,
your
honor.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
your
honor,
i
am
positive
in
my
mind.
and
if
i'm
in
error,
the
petitioners
can
correct
me.
the
commission
gave
no
weight,
no
consideration
whatsoever
to
the
peculiarities
of
the
words
used
in
the
shell
contract.
it
is
true
there
were
other
contracts
in
evidence
by
shell.
and
the
commission
said,
“well,
the
way
those
contracts
will
work
--
you
see
in
these
other
contracts,
they
had
“favored-nation”
clauses
that
would
apply
whenever
the
pipeline
paid
any
higher
price.
so
the
commission
said,
“shell,
if
it
wanted
its
clause
here
to
cover
every
higher
price,
could
have
used
that
language,”
but
that
overlooks
one
of
the
fundamental
significant
points
that
we
have
always
made.
we
do
not
contend
that
our
clause
is
all
inclusive
and
that
it
covers
every
increase.
we
content
it
only
covers
higher
prices
resulting
from
entry
in
to
a
contract
by
the
pipeline.
we
admit
it's
a
limited
clause.
so
saying
that
here
are
some
clauses
that
are
all
inclusive,
to
me,
does
not
mean
that
every
other
clause
is
all
exclusive
but
one.
now,
to
get
back
to
your
question,
your
honor,
i
am
firmly
convinced
the
commission
did
not
base
it's
conclusion
upon
peculiar
words
because
you
can
look
at
--
actually
what
the
commission
itself
did
in
the
commission's
original
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
that's
the
only
way
i
could
do
it,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case,
the
staff
counsel
before
they
examine
even
contended
that
the
commission
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
resolve
this
interpretation
question
because
it
was
one
of
law
for
the
courts.
but
let
us
look
at
how
the
commission
treated.
if
your
honors
would
like
to
see
it,
on
page
132
of
the
record
appears
--
that's
a
part
of
the
commission's
original
order.
in
about
one-third
of
the
way
down,
the
commission
says
“the
question
before
us.”
this
is
in
the
record,
i
--
i
--
not
the
brief,
the
record,
page
132.
they
say,
“the
question
before
us
is
whether
the
letter
agreement
constitutes
a
new
contract
for
the
purchase
of
gas
or
whether
it
merely
represents
action
taken
pursuant
to
the
preexisting
1943
agreement.”
then
they
say,
“we
believe
the
latter
is
the
correct
view.”
then
skipping
down
about
six
or
seven
lines,
the
commission
says
“the
cases
show,
the
cases
show
that
a
contract
will
not
fail
for
want
of
certainty
where
a
future
price
is
to
be
fixed
by
arbitrators.”
then
the
commission
goes
on
to
discuss
the
question
not
of
the
shell
clause.
they
apparently
assumed.
as
far
as
i
can
read
the
commission's
order,
they
assume
or
interpolate
the
word
“new”
into
the
shell
clause.
and
then
they
say
this
other
agreement
in
1954
between
the
pipeline
and
the
atlantic
was
not
new
because
it
was
action
taken
under
a
preexisting
contract.
and
the
reason
for
that
they
say
is
that
the
old
atlantic
contract
first
made
back
in
1943
continued
through
out
because
it
contained
an
arbitration
clause.
and
they
said
the
arbitration
clause
made
everything
all
right.
now,
your
honors,
under
the
shell
clause,
i
repeat,
first
of
all,
the
facts
remains,
these
parties
did
not
arbitrate.
they
entered
after
extensive
negotiations
that
extended
over
five
and
a
half
--
a
period
of
five
and
a
half
months.
as
the
witness
testified,
they
haggled
back
and
forth
and
they
finally
reached
an
agreement
on
price.
one
side
said
this
is
as
high
as
we
are
going
and
the
other
side
said,
“well,
we
will
see
if
we
can
get
that
agreed
too.”
and
then
they
entered
into
their
agreement.
we
believe,
your
honors,
that
the
federal
power
commission's
construction
of
the
shell
clause
and
the
legal
conclusion
that
it
reaches
with
respect
to
this
contract
made
between
atlantic
and
the
pipeline
would
largely
defeat
one
of
the
principle
purposes
of
the
shell
clause.
this
shell
contract
contains
a
rather
comprehensive
pricing
arrangement.
the
contract
has
one
of
the
so-called
fixed
step-up
clauses
under
which
the
price
will
go
up
in
definite
amounts
at
definite
dates.
it
also
has
one
of
the
so-called
price
redetermination
clauses
but
that
doesn't
come
into
effect
until
after
the
first
10
years.
then
it
has
this
“favored-nation”
clause.
now,
that
“favored-nation”
clause
appears
at
page
66
of
the
record.
and
it
says
that
if,
after
the
given
date,
the
buyer
shall
enter
into
a
contract.
now,
your
honors,
the
petitioners
give
a
lot
of
emphasis
not
--
to
the
next
phrase
providing
for
the
purchase
by
it
of
gas
produced
within
a
given
fee.
what
that
language
means,
we
believe,
what
the
draftsman
did,
that
language
is
merely
descriptive
of
the
commodity
that
the
other
contract
had
to
govern.
a
man
preparing
this
clause
said,
“well,
you
have
to
run
into
another
contract.”
it
would
have
to
be
a
contract
dealing
with
something.
it
couldn't
be
crude
oil
or
something
else.
it
had
to
be
a
contract
providing
for
the
purchase
of
what?
of
gas.
had
they
there
intended
to
describe
the
type
of
contract?
i
submit
they
would
have
said,
“had
they
entered
into
a
new
gas
supply
contract?”
but
they
didn't
do
that.
now,
we
go
on
down
a
little
further.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
sir?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
enter
into
a
contract?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
--
i
think
they
mean,
your
honors,
whenever
after
the
result
of
a
negotiated
agreement,
the
pipeline
comes
up
with
a
higher
price
to
another
producer
within
the
50-mile
radius.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
now,
you
can
have
entry
into
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
i
think,
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
they
must
do
that.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
it
would
be
new
in
the
sense
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
of
time.
it
would
be
new
in
the
sense
of
time
in
that
it
would
be
subsequent
but
it
would
not
be
new
or
it
need
not
be
new
in
the
sense
that
the
federal
power
commission
construed
it.
now,
the
federal
power
commission
said,
“everything
would
have
--
let
me
go
back
a
moment.
as
i
understand
the
federal
power
commission's
order,
if
the
old
atlantic
contract
had
not
contained
an
arbitration
clause
but
had
contained
merely
an
agreement
to
agree
clause
and
then
these
parties
had
agreed
and
carried
out
the
agreement
to
agree,
i
think
under
the
commission's
reasoning,
they
would
have
said,
“that
meets
our
new
contract
because
there
wasn't
an
enforceable
binding
relationship
between
the
parties
and
you
supplied
it
when
you
made
the
agreement.”
now,
i
fully
agreed
that
it
has
to
be
new
but
in
the
sense
of
time
subsequent
to
a
given
day.
it
does
not
have
to
be
new
in
the
sense
of
covering
a
new
supply
of
gas.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
it
might
be
a
new
contract.
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
would
satisfy
this
clause.
your
honors,
let's
--
let
me
see
if
i
can
answer
that
by
an
example.
suppose
--
and
i
--
and
i
give
one
i
--
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago.
suppose
in
the
atlantic
contract,
that's
the
other
contract,
these
parties
had
a
fixed
contract
for
25
years
at
a
fixed
price,
no
escalation
clause,
no
agreement
to
agree
clause,
nothing
like
that
in
it,
just
a
straight
fixed
price.
and
in
1954,
the
seller
went
to
atlantic
and
said,
“look,
i
think
this
price
is
too
low.
let's
see
if
we
can
do
something
about
it.
let's
see
if
we
can
agree
upon
a
new
price
for
it.”
so
they
negotiated
and
they
haggled
back
and
fourth
and
they
finally
agreed
upon
a
new
price,
and
they
entered
into
a
letter
agreement.
now,
that,
your
honor,
i
submit,
would
be
entry
into
a
contract
dealing
with
natural
gas
within
the
prescribed
area
at
a
higher
price,
and
i
think
that
would
have
activated
our
clause.
let
me
try
to
give
another
example
that
might
demonstrate
what
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
say,
and
i
think
in
part
may
answer
what
petitioner
said
with
reference
to
this
other
contract
covering
these
various
elements
of
quality
and
quantity.
now,
let
us
suppose
that
in
1954,
when
the
pipeline
and
atlantic
made
this
letter
of
agreement,
suppose
after
they
have
agreed
upon
that
new
price
of
12.5
cents,
instead
of
merely
writing
a
letter
and
saying
--
and
signing
the
letter,
supposed
they
had
said,
“well,
this
whole
agreement
is
--
is
dirty
or
torn
up.”
but
for
reasons
of
their
own
they
said,
“let's
just
reproduce
the
old
contract
word
for
word
for
word
except
this
new
price
we've
agreed
upon.”
now,
that
would
have
contained
each
and
every
one
of
those
elements.
and
if
you
will
then
concede
that
that
meets
the
shell
clause,
and
unless
you
are
going
to
permit
form
to
govern
over
substance,
that's
precisely
what
they
did
in
1954
when
the
pipeline
and
the
atlantic,
after
these
extensive
negotiations,
just
entered
into
a
letter
confirming
their
contract.
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
when
the
petitioner
say
there
are
only
two
types
of
these
escalation
clauses,
if
--
if
i
understand
their
position
correctly,
they
say
the
shell
clause
is
a
so-called
“new”
or
“future
type”
of
clause,
and
it
can
only
be
activated
when
the
pipeline
goes
out
and
enters
into
a
new
contract
covering
a
new
supply
of
gas.
as
i
understand
that,
they
say
every
one
of
these
clauses
is
either
one
extreme,
that
is
it
applies
to
every
higher
price
or
it's
the
other
extreme
where
it
applies
only
when
the
pipeline
goes
out
and
buys
a
new
supply
of
gas.
that,
your
honors,
would
leave
no
middle
ground,
no
in-between
ground.
suppose
parties
want
to
make
another
agreement
like
the
shell
clause,
here,
shell
was
not
interested
in
its
price
increasing
when
the
price
increased
to
the
pipeline
under
these
fixed
step-up
clauses
in
a
preexisting
contract.
shell
and
the
pipeline
had
made
their
own
bargain
in
that
regard.
but
certainly,
parties
are
to
be
able
to
make
other
contracts.
we
submit
the
commission's
conclusion
and
the
petitioners'
position
here
would
leave
no
middle
ground
on
that.
one
other
thing
in
connection
with
those
clauses,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
record
shows
that
at
the
time
of
the
shell
contract
in
1951,
the
pipeline
was
also
the
purchaser
under
the
neighboring
atlantic
contract.
now,
as
the
purchaser
under
that
contract,
that
pipeline
certainly
knew
of
this
clause
in
the
atlantic
contract
which
was
an
agreement
to
agree
clause.
and
certainly,
it
was
not
a
price
redetermination
clause
as
the
petitioners
indicated.
the
party
said
they
would
agree
upon
price.
all
price
would
be
fixed
by
arbitration.
but
at
any
rate,
the
pipeline
certainly
knew
of
that
clause
at
the
time
it,
the
pipeline,
prepared
the
shell
clause.
under
those
circumstances,
isn't
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
if
the
pipeline
did
not
want
its
price
to
increase
when
the
atlantic
price
went
up
under
that
agreement
to
agree
clause,
it
would
have
said
so.
another
fact
that
we
think
of
extreme
significance
in
this
case
is
this.
it's
stated
in
the
briefs
of
the
government
and
of
the
pipeline
that
it's
very
strongly
to
the
benefit
of
the
pipeline
to
limit
these
“favored-nation”
clauses
as
much
as
they
possibly
can.
and
i
can't
again
say
that.
maybe
it
is.
it's
also
shown
in
this
record
that
the
pipeline
prepared
this
clause.
it
is
further
shown
in
this
record
at
the
time
the
pipeline
prepared
this
clause,
it
was
the
purchaser
under
the
atlantic
agreement.
now,
if
it
had
been
the
intention
of
the
parties
at
that
time
in
1951
to
limit
this
shell
clause,
and
if
the
limitation
of
the
shell
clause
in
that
regard
was
so
all
important
to
that
pipeline,
and
since
that
pipeline
prepared
that
clause,
isn't
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
it
would
have
done
what
some
other
pipelines
have
done
and
made
it
clear
that
the
shell
price
would
not
increase
except
when
the
pipeline
bought
new
gas
under
a
new
supply
contract.
now,
your
honors,
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
a
typical
contract
at
page
33,
near
the
bottom
of
page
33
of
the
shell
brief
and
some
hearings
on
the
harris
bill
which
was
to
amend
the
natural
gas
act
in
1955.
there
is
shown
there
a
“favored-nation”
clause.
and
i
would
just
like
to
read
two
or
three
lines
from
that.
your
honors
can
--
can
follow
it
because
it
shown
as
3a
down
at
the
bottom
of
that
page.
“buyer
agrees
that
if
during
the
term
of
this
contract,
it
purchases
from
producers
new
gas
from
new
sources
of
supply,”
and
then
it
goes
on,
“in
a
given
area
that
it
will
give
the
same
price
to
the
seller”.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
had
that
been
the
intention
of
the
parties
when
the
pipeline
prepared
the
clause,
it
certainly
would
have
used
language
along
that
line,
perhaps
not
that
specific
language.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
think
that's
substantially
what
our
clause
says
when
you
say
if
it
purchases
in
this
area.
now,
suppose
you
put
that
in
that
clause,
and
i
come
along
to
construe
it
and
i
read
into
it,
makes
a
new
purchase
in
this
area,
the
very
word
you
used,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
i
--
sir?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
yes.
well,
even
then,
someone
could
say
--
when
you
use
the
words
“if
they
purchase
at
a
higher
price”
would
mean,
if
they
go
out
and
make
a
contract
under
which
they
purchase,
i
would
agree
that
that
would
not
be
the
interpretation
to
me.
your
honor,
let
me
say
this.
hindsight
would
certainly
dictate,
if
you
told
me
today,
“go
out
here
and
prepare
a
clause
now,”
that
you
will
be
positive
will
cover
that
situation.
i
am
not
now
saying
that
someone
could
not
have
written
it
differently
so
that
you
would
eliminate
all
doubt.
i
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
right.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
for
two
reasons,
i
believe,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
they
prepared
the
clause.
and
secondly
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
our
grant
is
not
an
insurance
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
policy.
all
right.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
but
the
fact
remains,
your
honor,
that
still
i'm
writing
the
clause
but
the
more
important
thing
is
this.
i
believe
it's
only
reasonable
if
it's
so
highly
important
to
me
as
the
pipeline
now
says
it
is
that
i
get
only
one
of
these
highly
restrictive
clauses,
then
i
believe
that
when
i
drafted
the
clause,
i
would
have
made
that
position
clear.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
--
is
if
the
parties
had
so
intended,
and
since
that
is
so
important
to
the
pipeline,
it's
only
reasonable
that
a
man
is
going
to
do
something
to
benefit
himself
when
he
thinks
it's
so
all
important,
at
least
i
believe
that.
and
i
believe
the
pipeline
would
have
done
that.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
it's
rather
important
to
us.
we
concede
it,
your
honor,
and
here
was
a
difficulty
in
the
clause.
it
was
not
our
agreement
that
our
price
go
up
in
every
situation.
we
had
negotiated
out
on
our
own
fixed
step-up
clause.
so
our
bargain
with
the
pipeline
was
that
there
would
be
some
limitation
in
this
clause.
we
fully
concede
that,
your
honor.
but
we
say
the
fact
that
the
parties
intended
some
limitation
does
not
mean
that
you
have
to
construe
it
as
though
it's
fully
limited
and
applies
only
when
the
pipeline
goes
out
and
buys
a
new
supply
of
gas
for
this
reason.
it
seems
to
me
only
reasonable
that
when
you
put
these
escalation
clauses
in
these
contracts,
the
parties,
of
course,
thinking
about
price,
and
the
testimony
--
the
shell
testimony,
i
believe,
are
fair
and
reasonable
reading
of
it,
leads
me
to
believe
that
shell
was
seeking
some
equality
of
price
when
the
pipeline
went
out
and
made
a
negotiated
agreement.
now,
your
honor
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
yes.
it
would
certainly
not
apply
in
the
case
where
the
pipeline
already
had
a
contract
but
had
one
of
these
fixed
step-up
clauses
in
it
and
the
price
automatically
went
up
under
that
pre-fixed
clause.
am
i
making
that
clear?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
i
can
--
i
can
give
you
a
demonstration
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
if
you
like.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
the
second
thing.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
in
any
case
where
the
pipelines
price
under
an
existing
contract
would
be
increased
without
the
parties
having
to
come
to
a
new
meeting
of
minds,
i
do
not
believe
our
clause
would
apply.
for
instance,
if
they
had
something
that
was
just
presented
a
mathematical
problem,
if
you
had
to
add
up
three
things
and
divide
it
by
three,
i
would
not
contend
here
or
elsewhere
that
that
constituted
entry
into
a
contract
providing
for
gas
with
a
higher
price
because
they
already
had
their
contract.
now,
those
two
situations
and
the
general
one,
i've
tried
to
mention
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
mr.
chief
justice.
but
what
i
was
just
about
to
say
was
shell
would
be
just
as
intractably
deprived
of
this
equality
of
price
in
the
general
area
by
virtue
of
this
1954
agreement
which
was
a
negotiated
agreement
under
an
existing
contract
as
we
would
be
deprived
of
equality
of
price
if
the
pipeline
went
out
and
bought
a
new
supply
of
gas
from
an
entirely
new
purchaser.
isn't
that
sort
of
overlooking
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
this
clause?
your
honor
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
the
record
shows,
your
honor,
that
the
pipeline,
the
purchaser
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
well,
the
record
doesn't
show,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry
i
don't
know
who
drew
it.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
if
you
want
me
to
guess,
i
can.
i
[laughter]
--
but
the
record
doesn't
show,
and
i'm
sorry
i
don't
know
the
answer,
your
honor.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
sorry?
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
you
see,
normally,
the
pipeline
has
prepared
these
contracts.
i
know
--
mr.
justice,
i
know
of
no
other
shell
contract
that
has
this
specific
language
in
it.
there
maybe
one
or
two
but
i'm
familiar
with
quite
a
number.
i
know
of
none
that
has
that
specific
language
in
it.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
oh,
there
isn't
any
question.
they
wanted
to
place
a
limitation
upon.
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
well,
now,
i'm
talking
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
--
about
shell.
now,
the
pipeline
may
have
many
others.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
know
they
got
at
least
one
other
like
this
but
they
may
have
any
number
of
other
contract
like
this.
your
honors,
the
point
about
this
matter,
as
i
see
it,
certainly,
there
is
in
the
industry
but
general
understanding
that
you
have
“favored-nation”
clauses
and
various
types
of
other
price
escalation
clauses.
but
there
is
no
set,
fixed
industry
understanding
that
every
“favored-nation”
clause
is
either
an
all
inclusive
clause
or
an
all
exclusive
clause
but
the
one.
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
such
understanding.
i
think
everyone
of
these
clauses
depends
upon
its
own
wording.
that's
what
our
clause
depends
upon.
that's
all
we
are
contending
for.
we
only
want
what
it
gives
us
and
nothing
more.
and
we
believe
that's
the
way
the
--
the
commission
looked
at
it,
and
that's
also
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
it.
your
honors,
there
are
other
points
covered
in
our
brief.
the
petitioners
make
a
point
of
the
fact
that
shell
was
delayed
somewhat
in
bringing
to
the
attention
of
the
pipeline
our
claim
for
it.
there
are
only
two
things
important
in
that
connection.
the
clause
calls
for
the
pipeline
to
give
shell
notice
and
that
notices
was
never
given.
secondly
--
mr.
oliver
l.
stone
we
filed
out
about
the
atlantic
contract
in
march,
your
honor.
we
did
not
write
to
the
pipeline
until
october
of
that
year
which
was
about
seven
months.
now,
the
record
will
show,
however,
that
we
--
shell
accidentally
learned
of
the
entry
into
the
other
contract.
we
didn't
know
about
it.
we
accidentally
learned
of
it.
and
then
we
had
to
scout
around
and
get
a
copy
of
the
other
contract
between
the
pipeline
and
atlantic.
and
then
it
was
seven
months
--
between
seven
months,
between
the
time
we
learned
until
we
wrote
them.
now,
thereafter,
there
was
another
delay
after
the
federal
power
commission
wrote
back
to
us
and
said,
“explain
why
you're
claiming
12.5
cents.”
but
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
you
honor,
negotiations
were
going
during
a
quite
a
period
of
that
time.
and
also,
you
might
recall
the
harris
bill
was
up
before
congress.
and
we
were
hoping
maybe
we
wouldn't
have
filed
anything
but
that
didn't
turn
out.
therefore,
your
honors,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
