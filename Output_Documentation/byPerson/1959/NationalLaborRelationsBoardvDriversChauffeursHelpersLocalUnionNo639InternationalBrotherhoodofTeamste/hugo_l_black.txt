it
been
asked
to

black
(voice

opinion
brought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
would
have
been
any
case,
before
this
one
or
indicates
as
the
board
upheld
this
decision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
this
one
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
when
was
the
act
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
there
had
been
efforts
to
get
the
board
to
pass
this
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
board
in
perry
novell
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
(inaudible)
what
efforts
have
been
made
through
the
years
to
get
this
done,
either
the
attorney
for
the
board
or
anyone
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
they
said,
what
did
they
hold?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
they
held.
justice
hugo
l.
black
never
thought
an
illegal
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
for
an
illegal
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
for
the
illegal
purpose,
what
you
call
the
illegal
purpose
of
--
it's
by
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
recognition
when
they
didn't
have
a
minority
or
majority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
practice
was
over
through
the
years
whether
both
--
where
the
counsel
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
such
would
not
violate
this
section.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
was
the
practice
is?
how
do
you
bring
them?
i
thought
the
counsel
had
a
lot
to
do
with
it,
maybe
i'm
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
even
those
years,
that
he,
that's
the
position
he
took?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
--
that
was
in
practice,
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
during
those
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
he
on
the
civil
service?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
he
on
the
civil
service?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
the
--
how
do
you
get
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
don't
understand
the
great
significance
of
it
but
i
don't
see
how
you
quite
read
it
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
this
report
criticize
this
statement,
criticized
this
action
or
this
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who'd
it
report
it
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
and
who
was
this
watchdog
committee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
said
who
was
this
watchdog
committee?
it
made
this
report.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
got
the
list
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
just
been
quoting
to
us
senators
taft
and
ball's
report
now,
as
to
--
to
show
the
meaning
of
the
bill.
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
on
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wanted
to
supplement
it,
why
didn't
it
say
so,
why
didn't
it
include
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
--
does
it
cover
this,
what
they
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
cover?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
pass?
does
it
cover?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
didn't
pass.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
it
cover
it
then
now
for
a
new
situation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
will
be
a
certain
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
manoli,
i
was
just
about
to
ask
you
a
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
you
say
and
maybe
your
advisory,
the
statute
as
now
enacted
would
make
what
has
been
done
--
what
was
done
here
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
have
an
order
against
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
happen
that
if
you
did
there
under
court
of
appeals,
what
is
the
result,
what
are
the
consequences
to
the
government
in
this
--
is
this
â€“
is
this
the
only
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
number
of
cases
where
the
judgments
have
already
been
rendered
in
cases
of
this
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
board
had
issued
orders?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
have
the
statutes
--
the
statute
now
that
covers
it.
what
i
was
interested
in
is
what
is
the
very
importance
of
keeping
those
orders,
it
--
it
may
be
very
important
keeping
those
orders
out,
when
you
have
a
statute
with
that
law
is
the
same
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
--
if
they
are
the
same
as
i
understood
you
to
say,
just
what
difference
does
that
make?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
what
is
the
circumstance
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
although
we
decide
that
in
this
case
--
those
cases
in
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
decide
those
cases
in
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
well
would
the
government
--
does
the
government
get
any
advantage
for
as
consequences
are
concerned,
can
it
find
unfair
labor
practice
under
circumstances,
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
if
you
should
be
sustained?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
cannot
find
unfair
labor
practice
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
under
the
law
as
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
so,
the
result
--
what
you
are
asking
is
they
are
not
the
equivalent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
asking
is
that
this
be
decided
on
the
basis
that
would
--
would
give
you
right
to
find
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
circumstances
which
congress
did
not
include
and
exempt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
doesn't
necessary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
thatcher
would
it
--
this
range
of
kind
of
argument
to
state
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
congress
in
1959
was
asked
to
and
rejected
or
accepted
in
any
way
broader
powers
of
the
board
than
the
amended
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
has
been
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
have
covered
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
might
--
that
might
be
the
reason
that
sometimes
to
say
that
in
any
other
things
which
we
don't
have
something
else
of
that
specific
plan.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
act
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
mean
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
act
that
--
the
act
of
this
(inaudible),
is
that
the
one
with
those
too
much
controversy
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'm
talking
about
the
1959.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
act
was
that?
was
that
the
landrum-griffin
bill?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
care
about
legislative
history,
i'm
interested
to
know
if
that's
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
name
of
the
--
