justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
board
mistaken
this
however
that
they're
not
relevant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
just
want
to
be
clear
to
the
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
determining
immediately
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
board
concedes
that
we'll
have
to
take
into
account
the
1959
amendments.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
is
not
to
standing
to
be
arguable
as
to
the
amendments,
in
terms
would
cover
the
very
picketing
under
the
terms.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me,
mr.
manoli,
do
you
think
that
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
is
ambiguous
to
be
brought
about
to
cover
section
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
covers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
(c)
necessary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
get
the
(c)
situation
as
the
board
applies
on
the
property
charged
him
and
that
also
involving
8
(b)
(1)
(a)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
we
might
have
a
situation
where
you
have
to
certify
it
and
yet
in
fact,
another
union
who
is
representative
of
the
--
that
charges
the
employees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
that's
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
they
discussed
in
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
manoli.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
very
picketing
that
we're
concern
with
here
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
were
this
be
repeated
by
this
very
union
for
30
days
starting
march
would
be
reached
by
subsection
(c),
isn't
it
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
my
point
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
--
if
it
the
very
the
very
congress
which
(inaudible)
if
it
started
to
act
and
duplicate
it
starting
march,
it
could
be
reached
under
this
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
appreciate
--
as
i
say,
the
(inaudible)
30
days?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
why
--
why
should
we
decide
this
question
which
admittedly
is
reached
by
the
amended
facts?
why
should
we
wait
until
the
other
situation
can
come
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
what
i'm
suggesting
though.
i'm
suggesting
of
the
fact
situation
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
next
time
the
board
confronted
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
has
explicit
statutory
authority
to
deal
with
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
results
then
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
the
board,
it
can
be
reached
under
the
statute
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
supplemental
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
there
any
(inaudible)
to
that
effect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
that
(inaudible)
and
this
is
from
the
house
report
as
i
understand
it,
the
statement
of
the
managers
on
the
part
of
the
house,
section
8
(b)
(7)
overruled
the
curtis
and
alloy
cases
to
the
extent
that
these
decisions
were
inconsistent
to
sections
of
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
okay.
