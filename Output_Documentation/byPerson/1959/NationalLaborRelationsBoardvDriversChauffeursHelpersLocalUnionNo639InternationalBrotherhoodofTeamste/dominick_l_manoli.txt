mr.

may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
in
general,
the
case
deals
with
the
legality
of
picketing
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
force
an
employer
to
recognize
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
these
employees,
a
union
which
represents
either
none
of
them
or
only
a
minority
of
these
employees.
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
act
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
or
its
agents
to
restrain
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
under
section
7
of
the
act.
included
among
these
rights
is
the
right
of
employees
to
bargain
collectively
through
a
representative
of
their
own
choosing
or
to
have
none
at
all.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
union
which
pickets
to
force
the
employer
to
recognize
it
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
its
employees,
even
though
it
represents
none
or
only
a
minority
the
employees,
constitutes
restraint
and
coercion
of
the
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
statutory
rights
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
now,
let
me
briefly
summarize
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
this
question.
in
1953,
the
board
certified
the
respondent
union
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
some
21
employees
of
the
curtis
company
who
worked
as
warehousemen,
truck
drivers
and
furniture
finishers.
the
company
is
engaged
in
the
retail
furniture
business.
shortly
after
the
union
was
certified
by
the
board,
it
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
company
with
the
view
to
working
out
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
but
they
were
unable
to
arrive
with
an
agreement.
the
union
went
out
on
--
called
a
strike,
in
which
nine
of
the
21
employees
joined.
the
union
established
picket
lines
around
the
company's
stores,
its
retail
store
and
the
adjoining
warehouse
where
the
employees
who
were
involved
in
this
matter
worked.
the
company
replaced
the
nine
strikers
and
continued
its
operations
and
the
union
meanwhile,
continued
its
picketing.
some
15
months
or
so
later,
in
1955,
the
company
filed
a
petition
with
the
board,
asking
the
board
to
hold
an
election
to
determine
whether
the
employees
wished
to
be
represented
by
the
respondent
union.
the
board
held
that
election
and
of
the
29
votes
that
were
cast
in
that
election,
28
of
the
votes
were
against
the
union
and
only
one
for
the
union.
the
--
despite
its
overwhelming
defeat
at
the
polls,
the
union,
nevertheless,
continued
to
picket,
this
time,
only
in
front
of
the
company
store.
the
board
found
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
union
in
continuing
to
picket
and
i
might
say
that
there
is
really
no
question
about
this
finding
here,
the
board
found
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
union
in
continuing
to
picket
after
the
election
was
to
compel
the
employer
to
recognize
it
as
the
representative
of
the
employees,
despite
the
fact,
despite
the
fact
that
these
employees
had
decisively
rejected
this
union
as
their
--
as
their
bargaining
representative.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
no.
the
banners
which
they
said
were
two
kinds,
your
honor.
before
the
election,
the
banner
proclaimed
that
the
company
was
on
strike
and
it
was
unfair
to
organize
labor.
after
the
election,
the
banners
were
changed.
one
of
them
read,
as
i
recall
it,
that
the
company
was
unfair.
it
employed
nonunion
--
nonunion
men,
working
men
and
the
other
banner
was
to
the
effect
that
--
that
they
wanted
--
the
union
wanted
employees
to
join
the
union,
so
that
they
could
enjoy,
enjoy
union
working
conditions.
but
the
board
found,
and
as
i
said,
there's
really
no
challenge
here,
the
board
found
that
despite
whatever
the
signs
may
have
said
or
despite
the
claim
of
the
union
that
it
was
not
seeking
immediate
recognition
from
the
employer
that
the
union
was
in
fact,
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
requiring
the
employer
to
recognize
it,
notwithstanding,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
these
employees
had
decisively
rejected
this
union
as
their
bargaining
representative.
now,
the
board
further
found
that
picketing
by
a
union,
which
represents
either
none
or
only
a
minority
of
the
employees,
to
force
the
employees
to
accept
it
as
their
bargaining
representative,
constitutes
an
invasion
of
the
employees'
rights
under
the
statute
and
constitutes
restraint
and
coercion
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
the
board
accordingly
entered
an
order
directing
the
union
to
refrain
from
this
conduct.
the
court
below
disagreed
with
the
board.the
court
below
took
the
position
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
statute
was
not
intended
--
was
not
intended
by
congress
to
reach
this
kind
of
picketing.
and
that
accordingly,
the
board
below
set
aside
the
board's
order.
i
may
add
in
passing,
that
of
the
three
circuit
courts
that
have
dealt
with
this
issue,
they
have
split
out.
two
of
them
including
the
court
below
in
the
second
circuit
had
disagreed
with
the
board.
the
--
and
the
third
one
which
the
fourth
circuit
has
upheld
the
board's
views
in
this
respect.
now,
before
i
go
on
to
discuss
the
considerations
which
underlie
this
controversy,
i
should
like
to
say,
a
preliminary
word
concerning
the
order
of
my
remarks.
this
case
arose
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended
in
1947.
and
the
question
as
i've
been
to
--
as
i've
indicated,
is
whether
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
statute
reaches
this
kind
of
picketing.
now,
following
the
board
decision,
as
well
as
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
this
case,
congress
passed
it.
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware.
congress
passed
the
1959
amendments
to
the
statute
and
included
--
included
in
these
amendments
is
a
provision
which
i'll
merely
say
in
general
to
state
it
again.
the
general
regulates
--
regulates
organizational
and
recognition
picketing
whether
it's
by
a
majority
or
minority
union.
now,
the
board
believes
--
the
board
believes
that
these
amendments
do
not
affect
--
do
not
affect
its
conclusions
that
it
reached
in
this
case
and
further
that
they
do
not
affect
its
order.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
no,
not
at
all.
we
are
--
i
was
going
to
say.
we
did
--
we
do
take
the
position
that
they
do
not
affect
the
conclusions
which
the
board
reached
in
this
case
and
do
not
affect
its
order.
and
that
if
the
board's
views
prevail
as
to
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
then
its
order
is
entitled
to
stand.
now,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
first.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
it's
inescapable.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
i
may
just
briefly
summarize
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
one,
we
will
say
that
the
amendments
--
our
position
is
that
the
amendments
do
not
impute
the
board's
authority
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
picketing
under
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
that
congress
has
not
resolved
that
problem,
determine
where
the
board
has
that
power
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
or
not,
by
passing
the
subsequent
legislation.
and
our
second
point
with
respect
to
those
amendments
is
that
these
amendments
do
not
displace
the
board's
power
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
picketing
under
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
they
supplement
it
and
i'll
come
to
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
would.
that's
right,
notwithstanding
that.
now,
as
i
said,
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
first
address
myself
to
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
in
the
context
of
the
1947
amendments.
obviously,
the
board
did
not
have
the
power
to
deal
with
this
thing
here
under
1947.
we
never
reached
the
issue
of
what,
the
subsequent
amendments
do.
and
secondly
then,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
significance
and
the
impact
of
the
--
of
the
1959
amendments
along
the
lines
that
i've
just
suggested
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
now,
one
of
the
fundamental
policies
of
the
statute
is
to
afford
to
employees
full
freedom
in
the
selection
of
a
bargaining
representative
of
their
own
choosing.
section
7
implements
this
policy
and
guarantees
to
employees
the
right
to
select
a
bargaining
representative
for
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
or
to
have
none
at
all.
the
picketing
in
this
case
was
in
defiance
of
that
statutory
guarantee
for
it
sought
to
force
upon
the
employees,
a
union
which
it
did
--
did
not
want.
indeed,
one
which
they
had
decisively
rejected
in
a
board
election.
if
the
employer
had
recognized
this
union
and
assisted
in
forcing
it
upon
the
unwilling
employees,
he
would
have
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice.
his
action
in
that
respect
would
have
constituted
restraint
and
coercion
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
statute.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
what
i
mean.
now,
is
it
in
the
less
restraint
or
coercion,
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
on
the
part
of
a
union
to
resort
to
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
the
employees
to
surrender
their
right
of
self-determination
and
to
conscript
the
assistance
of
the
employer
in
shaping
this
illegal
objective.
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
as
i
have
said,
makes
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
labor
organization
to
restrain
or
coerce
the
employees
in
the
exercise
of
section
7
rights,
including
their
right
of
self-determination.
the
two
elements
--
the
two
elements
of
the
offense
are,
one,
that
the
union's
action
constitutes
restraint
and
coercion
and
secondly,
that
such
restraint
or
coercion
cuts
in
--
cuts
into
to
the
employees'
right
of
self-determination.
now,
i
think
there
can
be
no
question.
indeed,
i
don't
believe
that
the
other
side
seriously
challenges
this,
that
taking
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
literally
at
least,
literally,
it
can
be
read
--
it
can
be
read
to
encompass
this
kind
of
picketing,
where
its
purpose
is
as
i
have
said,
to
override
the
employees'
self-determination
in
these
questions
of
representation.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
was
for
the
union
to
force
itself
upon
these
unwilling
employees
and
the
union
sought
to
achieve
that
objective.
it
sought
to
achieve
that
objective
by
threatening
the
livelihood
of
the
workers.
one
of
the
purposes,
an
obvious
purpose
of
the
picketing,
of
course,
was
to
turn
away
both
customers
and
suppliers
of
the
company
and
to
work
economic
loss
upon
the
company.
and
of
course,
such
economic
duress
--
such
economic
duress,
not
only
--
not
only
tends
to
force
the
employer's
hand
and
to
recognize
the
union
which
as
an
--
not
entitled
to
recognition,
but
it
also
tends
--
it
also
tends
to
force
the
employees
however
unwillingly,
to
forgo
their
statutory
rights
and
to
acquiesce
in
representation
through
a
union
which
they
do
not
want.
now,
it
seems
to
us,
your
honors,
there
can't
be
--
that
there
can't
be
a
more
unequivocal
way
of
restraining
or
coercing
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
than
to
cause
them
to
fear
the
disappearance
of
their
jobs.
now,
nothing
in
the
statutory
policy
that
seems
to
us
justifies
--
justifies
removing
this
kind
of
picketing,
this
kind
of
economic
duress
from
the
reach
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
one
of
the
foundations
of
collective
bargaining
which
the
statute
has
adopted
is
a
national
policy,
either
the
employees
shall
be
free
to
select
or
reject
a
bargaining
representative
without
employer
restraint
or
union
coercion.
now,
it
seems
to
us,
your
honors,
that
this
kind
of
picketing,
the
economic
duress,
that
was
behind
this
kind
of
picketing,
abridges
that
right
of
the
employees,
their
right
of
self-determination
and
subverts
that
national
policy.
indeed,
where
as
here,
you
have
a
board
election
and
the
employees
have
turned
the
union
down
and
the
union
seeks
to
override
the
--
the
subversion
--
the
subversion
of
the
--
of
the
national
policies
even
more
flagrant.
as
even
far
more
flagrant,
because
the
union
is
seeking
to
override
by
means
of
economic
pressure,
the
employees'
deliberate
and
solemn
choice
which
they
have
made
in
the
board
election.
now,
no
policy
of
the
statute
is
--
moreover,
i
might
add,
as
i've
said
before
that
if
the
employer
were
to
recognize
the
union
in
these
circumstances,
he
too
would
become
--
he
too
would
be
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice.
no
policy
of
the
statute
seems
to
what
is
served,
by
permitting
picketing
which
has
these
consequences.
it
seems
to
us
that
in
the
absence
of
any
legitimate
interest,
any
legitimate
competing
interest
of
the
contrary
and
we
submit,
there
is
none,
there
is
no
reason
why
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
should
not
be
given
unqualified
effect
to
reach
this
kind
of
picketing.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
statutory
policy
is
almost
required.
now,
let
me
turn,
i've
spoken
about
the
literal
language
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and,
of
course,
i'm
fully
aware
that
we
don't
stop
there.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
legislative
history
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
this
history
has
been
set
out
in
full
in
our
brief
and
i
will
not
attempt
to
retrace
it
step
by
step.
i'm
sure
that
each
side
will
be
able
to
quote
some
scripture
to
its
purposes.
indeed,
one
court
has
recently
said
that
perhaps
the
legislative
history
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
is
inconclusive.
but
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
there
are
three
hard
and
meaningful
facts
that
do
emerge
--
that
do
emerge
from
this
legislative
background
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
which,
i
think,
are
significant
for
our
purposes.
the
first
of
these
is
that
the
sponsors
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
intended
to
impose
upon
unions,
insofar
as
it
was
practical,
the
same
kind
of
restrictions
which
section
8
(a)
(1)
already
imposed
upon
employers,
with
respect
to
employer-intrusion
upon
protected
employee
interest
or
rights.
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
intended
to
vest
in
the
board
the
same
broad
power
that
deal
with
union
restraint
or
coercion
that
the
board
already
possessed
with
respect
to
employer
restraint
or
coercion
which
trenched
upon
the
employees'
rights.
now,
this
--
the
parallel
purpose
--
the
parallel
purpose
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
section
8
(a)
(1),
i
think,
is
significant
for
our
purposes.
an
employer
who
forces
upon
his
employees
a
union
which
they
do
not
want,
an
employer
who
exerts
economic
pressure
to
force
the
employees
to
accept
an
--
an
unwanted
union,
he
commits
an
unfair
labor
practice.
such
recognition
--
such
or
a
--
such
economic
duress
from
the
part
of
the
employers
is
a
classic
example
of
restraint
and
coercion
in
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
--
of
the
section
8
(a)
(1)
provisions.
now,
the
union's
action
in
this
case
is
the
counterpart
of
that
employer
action.
for
both
types
of
actions
involved,
they
involve
economic
pressure
for
the
purpose
of
achieving
the
same
illegal
objective,
the
denial
of
the
employees
of
their
right
of
self-determination
in
these
matters.
now,
it
seems
to
us,
that
if
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
is
to
--
and
8
(a)
(1)
are
to
be
given
the
intended
evenhanded
application
that
the
sponsors
or
the
--
of
the
sponsors
of
the
--
of
this
--
of
this
provision
intended,
then
there's
no
reason
for
differentiating
between
economic
pressure
by
a
union
or
economic
pressure
by
an
employer,
where
the
purpose
of
that
kind
of
pressure
is
to
settle
the
employees,
the
unwilling
employees
with
a
union
that
they
do
not
want.
in
either
case,
well,
it
seems
to
us,
you
have
restraint
or
coercion
in
violation
of
the
statute.
now,
secondly,
the
second
major
--
the
second
fact
that
i
think
does
emerge
form
the
legislative
history
which
is
of
some
significance
is
that
senator
taft
and
senator
ball,
who
among
the
principal
sponsors
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
made
it
clear
that
they
intended
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
to
reach,
both
stranger
and
minority
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
an
employer
to
grant
them
recognition.
they
illustrated
the
reach
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
during
the
debates
as
follows,
senator
taft
said
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
now
--
i'm
now
reading
from
page
29
of
our
brief,
your
honor,
where
it's
quoted.
as
the
union
went
to
a
plant
in
california
and
said,
“we
want
to
organize
your
employees,
call
them
in
and
tell
them
to
join
our
union."
the
employer
said,
"we
have
not
any
control
over
our
employees.
we
cannot
tell
them
under
the
act,
under
national
labor
relations
act
--
we
cannot
tell
them
under
the
national
labor
relations
act."
they
said,
"if
you
don't,
we
will
picket
your
plant,"
and
they
did
picket
it
and
closed
it
down
for
a
couple
of
months.
and
then
we
go
on
to
say,
he
concluded
with
a
statement
that
there
are
plenty
of
methods
of
coercion,
short
of
actual
physical
violence.
and
again
senator
ball,
who
was
as
i
say
one
of
the
principal
sponsors
of
this
legislation,
he
illustrated
the
reach
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
with
this
example,
and
again,
the
same
page,
your
honors,
of
our
brief.
he
said
that,
“that
was
intended
to
reach
the
case
where
the
teamsters
local
86
had
been
picketing
an
establishment,
although
no
members
of
the
union
were
employed
there
in
an
effort
to
coerce
those
who
were
employed
there
into
joining
a
union,
which
they
did
not
want
to
join.”
now
finally,
the
third
fact
--
the
third
fact
that
i
think
has
significance
for
us
does
emerge
from
this
legislative
background
is
this,
when
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
being
debated
on
the
senate
floor,
some
misgivings
work
expressed
that
perhaps
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
might
be
read
to
cover
peaceful
persuasion
or
peaceful
picketing
for
--
peaceful
picketing
for
legitimate
purposes.
senator
taft
assured
these
--
assured
these
senators,
assured
these
senators
that
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
not
intended
to
reach
that
kind
of
conduct.
but
nevertheless,
the
sponsors
of
the
bill,
they
never
wavered
--
they
never
wavered
from
their
view
--
from
their
view
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
intended
to
reach
--
was
intended
to
be
given
as
broad,
a
meaning,
as
broad
as
interpretation
as
section
8
(a)
(1)
had
received
in
protecting
employers
against
intrusion
with
respect
to
their
rights
through
employer
coercion
or
through
union
restraint.
now,
i
think
finally,
it
is
instructed,
it
is
instructed
to
look
to
the
circumstances
which
gave
birth
to
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
the
house
bill,
though
which
had
passed
the
house,
contained
some
very
broad
provisions
concerning
organizational
and
--
and
recognition
of
picketing.
the
house
bill
prohibited
picketing,
where
there
was
no
dispute
between
the
employer
and
his
employees.
it
prohibited
picketing
to
compel
an
employer
to
recognize
the
union,
which
had
not
been
certified
by
the
board
and
finally,
it
prohibited
picketing
to
compel
an
employer
to
violate
any
law.
the
senate
bill,
the
bill
which
had
been
reported
of
the
senate
committee,
contained
no
similar
provisions.
the
only
provision
that
the
senate
bill
contained
in
this
area
was
the
provision
which
subsequently
--
eventually
became
section
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
of
the
statute.
and
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
makes
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
engage
in
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
displacing,
for
the
purpose
of
displacing
a
union
which
has
been
certified
by
the
board.
now,
when
the
senate
bill
was
reported
out
of
the
committee,
five
members
of
the
committee
expressed
concern
that
the
senate
bill
didn't
--
has
against
the
--
as
reported
out
the
committee,
did
not
go
far
enough
--
did
not
go
far
enough
in
regulating
union
organizational
activity
and
particularly
as
the
sponsor
stated,
did
not
go
far
enough
in
regulating
minority
or
stranger
picketing
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
recognition.
now,
it
was
to
remedy
that
deficiency,
it
was
to
remedy
that
deficiency
that
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
that
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
proposed
and
in
part,
the
intention
was
to
bring
into
the
senate
bill,
to
bring
into
the
senate
bill
albeit
in
a
somewhat
modified
form,
some
of
the
restrictions
of
the
house
bill
contained
with
respect
to
picketing.
and
it
was
with
this
understanding,
it
was
with
this
understanding
that
the
conference
committee,
the
conference
adopted
the
bill
--
approved
the
bill
and
of
course,
then
the
bill
was
passed.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
you
will
find
--
i
will
answer
that
--
i
will
answer
in
just
a
few
moments,
if
i
may
finish
at
this
point
because
i
was
just
coming
to
it.
now,
to
conclude
the
legislative
history,
we
think,
we
think
that
taking
the
legislative
history
as
a
whole,
that
it
supports
and
then
a
strong
support
to
the
board's
interpretation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
now,
in
essence,
this
is
our
affirmative
case,
so
i
will
now
turn
to
the
case
on
the
other
side.
the
other
side
contends
that
there
are
specific
provisions,
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
among
them,
in
the
statute
which
evidenced
a
congressional
intention
not
to
reach
this
kind
of
picketing
under
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
and,
of
course,
the
principal
source
of
this
argument
is
section
8
(b)
(4)
(c),
which,
as
i
have
stated,
section
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
makes
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
picket
for
the
purpose
of
displacing
a
certified
union.
now,
the
argument
is
that
the
inference
to
be
drawn,
the
inference
from
--
to
be
drawn
from
the
specific
regulation
of
recognition
picketing
is
that
congress,
as
a
matter
of
deliberate
choice,
refrained
from
imposing
any
further
restrictions
upon
other
types
of
recognition
picketing.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no.
we
think
that
there,
doesn't
make
them
redundant.
and
we
think
there's
room
for
both
of
them
to
play.
and
if
i
may
finish
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
will
come
to
that
next.
the
--
now,
as
i
said,
the
argument
is
that
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
evidence
as
a
--
delivered
in
purpose
on
the
part
of
congress
to
have
only
this
restriction
upon
recognitional
picketing.
now,
it
seems
to
us,
your
honor,
that
in
view
of
the
circumstances
which
i
have
stated
that
gave
birth
to
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
that
this
inference
is
not
a
proper
one.
and
as
i've
already
indicated,
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
inserted
in
the
statute
because
of
misgivings
or
concern
expressed
by
the
committee
members
that
the
bill
which
already
included
section
8
(b)
(4)
(c),
did
not
go
far
enough
in
--
in
the
regulation,
in
the
regulation
of
organizational
activities
on
the
part
of
the
union.
now,
in
view
of
those
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
--
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
was
intending
to
add
to
supplement
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
and
to
include
within
the
--
with
--
within
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
minority
or
stranger
picketing
for
personal
recognition
where
there
was
no
certification
in
the
picture.
now,
the
argument
is
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
came
in,
in
the
--
in
the
senate
bill,
your
honor.
in
the
senate
bill
which
was
the
bill
which
was
reported
out
of
the
senate
committee.
after
the
senate
bill
committee
containing
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
was
reported,
then
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
the
five
committee
members
proposed
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
were
early
in
--
they
--
the
early
stages
of
the
discussion
on
8
(b)
--
on
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
but
as
i
indicated,
your
honor,
while
there
were
some
concern
expressed
as
the
reach
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
that
it
might
reach
peaceful
persuasion
or
peaceful
picketing
for
legitimate
purposes
to
sponsor
this
bill,
never
waiver
--
never
waivered
from
their
view
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
to
have
the
same
broad
interpretation
that
8
(a)
(1)
had
had
to
reach
economic
duress,
that
cut
into
the
employees'
rights.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
no,
no.
these
utterances
were
in
connection
with
the
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
proposal.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
now,
turning
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
that
doesn't
--
this
interpretation
to
make
8
(b)
in
effect,
i
think
what
your
honor
is
saying
as
the
court
below
did.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
doesn't
make
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
redundant,
if
we
had
this.
we
don't
think
it
does.
there
maybe
some
minimal
overlapping,
i
think,
but
we
think
that
there
is
room.
the
board's
interpretation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
gives
both
sections
the
room
to
play.
section
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
applies
only
--
only
where
you
have
a
board
certification
of
the
union
and
in
it
applies
even
though
the
union
that
is
seeking
recognition
is
a
majority
union
as
long
as
that
--
that
certification,
picketing
by
a
union
whether
it'd
be
minority
or
majority,
is
a
violation
of
that
--
of
that
section.
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
as
interpreted
by
the
board
applies
where
there
is
no
certification,
where
there
is
no
certification
and
it
reaches
minority
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
the
employers
to
have
a
union
which
they
don't
want.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
the
interpretation
which
the
board
has
placed
upon
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
does
not
displace
8
(b)
(4)
(c),
but
there
is
room
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
recall
any
case
where
we
have
concerned
ours
--
the
board
is
concerned
for
ourselves
--
itself
with
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
an
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
situation.
i
don't
know
of
any.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
a
certified
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
were
--
there
is
no
--
where
there
is
no
certified
union
in
the
picture.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
and
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
would
cover
that
kind
of
picketing.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
might
be
a
rival
union.
that
--
that's
right.
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
would
--
does
not
permit
picketing
by
another
union,
minority
or
majority,
where
there
is
a
board
certification.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
that's
right.
now,
the
further
argument
is
made,
your
honors,
that
section
13,
section
13
of
the
statute
also
militates
against
the
board's
reading
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
section
13
of
the
statute
provides
that
the
right
to
strike
shall
not
be
impaired
or
diminished
except
as
specifically
provided
in
the
statute.
now,
the
argument
is
made
on
this
phase
of
the
case
is
that
picketing
is
a
base
of
strike
action,
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
does
not
specifically
cover
picketing
and
that
therefore,
the
immunity
that
section
13
gives
to
strike
and
by
hypothesis
to
picketing,
cannot
be,
cannot
be
denied
under
--
under
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
it
seems
to
us
that
this
argument
is,
first,
question-begging
and
in
any
event,
unsound.
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
is
a
specific
provision
of
this
statute
and
if
this
kind
of
picketing
can
fairly,
can
fairly
be
read
into
section
--
into
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
then
it
is
a
specific
impairment
of
the
right
to
picket.
and
section
13
does
not
serve
to
protect
it
against
that
specific
impairment.
now,
i
can
illustrate
this
by
other
sections
of
the
statute.
section
8
(b)
(2),
for
example,
makes
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
cause
or
to
attempt
to
cause
an
employer
to
discriminate
against
his
employees
in
violation
of
the
statute.
it
says
nothing.
there's
nothing
about
a
strike
action
or
picketing
and
yet
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
8
(b)
(2)
would
not
reach
a
strike
or
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
an
employer
to
discriminate
against
his
employees.
or
take
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
itself,
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
itself
doesn't
say
any
at
all
about
mass
picketing
or
mass
strikes
or
violent
strikes
and
yet,
here
again,
no
one
has
suggested
that
section
13
would
protect
that
kind
of
a
thing
because
there
was
no
specific
provision
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
covering
that
sort
of
--
that
sort
of
activity.
now,
finally
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
exactly.
and
then
i
might
add
that
the
kind
of
strikes
that
congress
sought
to
protect
were
strikes
for
legitimate
purposes,
not
strikes
for
illegal
objects
so
that
section
13
wouldn't
apply
this
kind
of
thing
anyway.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
now
--
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
[laughs]
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
was
the
first
case,
your
honor,
in
which
the
board
has
dealt
specifically
--
has
dealt
specifically
with
record
with
--
with
--
shall
i
call
it
for
shorthand
for
minority
or
a
stranger
union
picketing
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
recognition.
now,
it
is
true
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
is
true,
your
honor,
that
in
1948,
the
board
had
the
so-called
perry
norvell
case.
now,
the
perry
norvell
case
did
not,
did
not
present
this
question
of
a
minority
union
or
a
stranger
union
seeking
to
compel
an
employer
to
recognize
it
as
a
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees,
however,
however,
the
board
did
say
in
that
case
and,
of
course,
this
is
heavily
relied
on
by
the
other
side,
the
board
did
say
in
that
case
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
intended
to
reach
union
conduct
such
as,
violence,
mass
picketing
or
union
with
threats
of
reprisal
--
of
direct
economic
harm
and
that
it
was
not
intended
necessarily,
not
intended
necessarily
to
reach,
to
reach
union
conduct
which
was
peaceful
and
--
and
coercive
even
though
such
conduct
had
an
illegal
purpose,
an
illegal
object.
now,
as
i've
said
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
was,
i
don't
recall.
i
--
i
was
checking
the
case
a
few
days
ago,
but
i
don't
recall
it
as
unanimous
or
not.
my
recollection
is
there
was
one
dissent,
but
i'm
not
certain
at
the
moment.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
have
none,
your
honor.
we
have
this
language.
the
board
has
had
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
1957
--
1957.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
1947.
perry
norvell
came
a
year
--
approximately
a
year
and
a
half
or
so
after
the
1947
amendments
were
passed.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
may
have
been
charges
filed,
your
honor.
charges
filed
with
the
general
counsel,
but
none
of
these
cases
came
to
the
board.
apparently,
i
think
it
must
be
said
in
all
candor,
in
all
candor
that
the
general
counsel,
apparently
between
perry
norvell
and
this
case,
that
the
general
counsel
has
read
the
perry
norvell
case
to
mean,
to
mean
that
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
did
not
reach
this
type
of
conduct.
so,
the
board
never
had
occasion,
never
had
occasion
to
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
there
was
the
n.m.u
case,
but
that,
your
honor,
while
the
board
dealt
with
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
that
involved
a
strike
on
the
part
of
a
union
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
perry
norvell
case
is
the
--
was
the
--
or
the
one,
the
first
cases
that
came,
that
came
to
the
board,
dealing
with
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
whether
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
reached,
reached
peaceful
union
conduct
which
was
coercive
and
had
an,
and
had
an
illegal
objective.
that
was
one
of
the
first
cases
to
reach
the
board,
after
the
1947
amendments
were
passed.
and
in
that
case,
as
i
have
said,
the
board
said
that,
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
did
not
reach
union
conduct
which
was
coercive
and
peaceful,
even
though,
even
though
it
had
an
illegal
object.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
what
they
held.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
what
they
held.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
it
did
not
present
this
case.
there
was
a
case
where
a
group
of
workers
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
when
i
say
the
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
with
my
--
with
a
--
a
demand
for
recognition
by
a
minority
union?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
is
the
first
case,
your
honor,
in
which
they
have
specifically
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
dealt
with
that
issue.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
rephrase
just
a
bit.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sorry
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
and
make
--
make
myself
clear.
in
the
perry
norvell
case,
the
board
--
there
was
a
situation
there
where
the
employees
were
striking,
were
striking
to
displace
a
union
which
was
being
recognized
by
the
employer.
and
during
the
life
of
the
contract,
they'd
simply
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
--
they
wanted
to
take
over
and
presumably
in
seeking
to
take
over,
whether
minority
or
majority
doesn't
appear
in
that
case,
your
honor.
well,
even
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
for
an
illegal
purpose.
that's
right.
now,
the
board
addressed
itself
to
the
meaning
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
in
that
case
and
it
said,
"it
doesn't
reach
this
kind
of
conduct."
but
the
board
there
was
not
faced,
was
not
faced
with
the
specific
issue
of
this
case
until
this
case
came
along.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
kind
of
illegal
purpose.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
issue
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
specific
issue
was
not
brought
to
the
board
and
it
was
not
until
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
way
its
done,
your
honor,
is
someone
comes
in
and
files
a
charge
with
the
general
counsel.
then
the
general
counsel
determines
whether
he
will
issue
a
complaint.
if
he
decides
not
to
issue
a
complaint
on
it,
the
matter
never
gets
to
the
board,
the
matter
never
gets
to
the
board.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
was
his
reading
of
perry
norvell
that
it
didn't
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
it
--
some
--
some
matches
of
the
general
counsel
where
he
didn't
refuse
to
issue
a
complaint
in
some
cases,
is
officially
noted.
they
are
aware
of
it,
but
the
board
can't
do
anything
about
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
exactly.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
and
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
is
the
presidential
appointee,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
is
the
situation,
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
general
counsel
has
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
yes.
yes,
couldn't
quite
debate
on
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
taft-hartley?
prior
to
taft-hartley,
your
honor.
there
was
not
a
division
between
the
general
counsel
and
the
board.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
was
one
agent
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
since
taft-hartley
--
one
about
four
--
four
--
four
with
the
present
incumbent.
and
if
i
may
illustrate
this
just
a
little
bit,
i
don't
want
to
use
up
my
time,
but
for
example,
in
the
“hot
cargo”
cases
which
this
court
decided.
now,
the
board
at
one
time
held
it
doesn't
show,
then,
of
course,
the
matter
could
have
rested
there.
the
general
counsel
is
seen
fit
and
never
issued
another
complaint.
but
yet,
the
whole
--
because
of
the
nature
of
the
problem,
the
general
counsel
felt
that
it
was
appropriate
to
bring
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
--
of
the
board
and
issued
the
complaints
in
order
to
that.
and
that's
happened
here.
and
it
seems
to
us,
your
honor,
that
where
you
have
a
statute,
where
you
have
a
statute
which
is
phrased
in
such
a
broad
and
general
terms
as
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
is,
with
restrain
or
coercion,
that
the
board
is
entitled,
is
entitled
to
reexamine
the
statute
of
this
kind
of
general
language
and
its
legislative
origin
in
the
light
of
its
experience
and
the
insights
that
it
gains
from
that
experience.
now,
i've
already
touched
upon
the
perry
norvell
case
in
which
they
say
the
other
side
and
places
a
great
deal
of
reliance
and
i
want
to
finish
this
and
then
i'll
get
to
the
1959
amendments.
i
want
to
finish
this
by
calling
--
by
saying
a
word
about
the
so
called
--
with
the
report
of
the
so
called,
"watchdog
committee.”
the
watchdog
committee,
as
is
colloquially
known,
was
set
up
by
the
19
--
by
congress
to
oversee
--
oversee
the
operation
of
the
1947
amendments
to
the
statute.
now,
the
watchdog
committee's
report
after
citing
the
board's
decision
in
perry
norvell
--
after
citing
the
board's
decision
in
perry
norvell
said
this
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
page
51
of
our
brief,
your
honor.
this
is
a
quotation
from
the
--
from
the
report
of
the
watchdog
committee.
they
said,
"present
law,
in
no
way,
limits
the
primary
strike
for
recognition
except
in
the
face
of
another
union
certification.
a
labor
organization
may
lose
an
election
and
which
it
was
the
only
union
on
the
ballot
and
the
next
day
call
a
legal
strike
to
force
the
employer
to
recognize
it
as
a
bargaining
agent
for
the
--
those
employees
who
have
just
rejected
it."
i
don't
know,
what
this
sentence
means,
your
honor.
it
may
mean
on
the
one
hand
that
this
was
the
committee's
understanding
of
what
congress
intended,
of
what
congress
intended
with
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
us,
it
seems
to
us
more
likely
that
this
is
merely
a
restatement,
a
restatement
of
what
the
committee
thought
that
the
board
had
held
as
to
the
meaning
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
because,
your
honor,
i
don't
have
the
full
quotation
here.
but
in
the
full
quotation,
it's
preceded
by
a
reference
to
the
perry
norvell
case
and
as
i
say
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
didn't
say
anything
at
all.
it
just
has
this
full
statement
after,
quoting
or
after
citing
perry
norvell.
and
as
i
say,
it
is
hard
to
tell
whether
this
is
merely
the
committee's
understanding
of
what
congress
intended
or
whether
this
is
merely
the
committee's
restatement.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
was
reported
to
congress.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
committee,
your
honor,
was
set
up,
was
set
up
to
oversee
the
operation
of
the
1947
amendments
and
to
report
back
to
congress
to
see
how
it
was
working
and
on
the
basis
of
which,
congress
might
or
might
not
want
to
make
some
adjustments
or
amendments
in
the
law.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
first
year,
your
honor,
the
first
year,
no.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
now,
but
whatever
this
statement
means
--
whatever
the
statement
means,
it
seems
to
us
that
we
cannot
place
a
great
deal
of
reliance
upon
it
as
an
index,
as
an
index
to
the
intent
of
the
1947
congress
when
it
passed
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
because
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
were
composed
of
various
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
member
of
both
houses,
i've
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
senator
ball
and
taft
were
on
--
were
on
the
committee,
that's
right.
now,
whatever
the
meaning
of
this
sentence
is,
it
seems
to
us
that
we
can't
rely
upon
it
too
heavily
because
this
report,
this
report
did
not
issue
until
18
months
after
congress
passed
the
1947
amendments.
and
indeed,
this
court
has
set,
that
this
report
is
no
part
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
amendments.
now,
this
brings
me
to
the
1959
amendments.
the
section
8
(b)
(7)
of
these
amendments
adds
a
new
unfair
labor
practice
to
the
statute.
it
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union,
for
in
a
none,
a
none
certified
union,
a
none
certified
union,
whether
it's
a
majority
union
or
a
minority
union
to
pick
--
to
force
the
--
or
to
force
or
require
the
employer
to
recognize
it
as
a
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees
or
to
force
or
require
the
employees,
force
or
require
the
employees
to
join
it.
one,
where
the
employer
is
already
recognizing
legally,
legally
recognizing
another
union.
two,
within
12
months
of
a
board
election
and
three,
where
it
needed
these
two
situations
prevail
from
a
period
not
to
exceed
--
for
a
period
not
to
exceed
30
days
unless
--
unless
within
that
period,
a
representation
petition
for
an
election
has
been
filed
with
the
board.
now,
this
provision,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
earlier,
this
provision
would've
covered
the
picketing
in
this
case.
now,
i
think
that
this
new
amendments
suggest
for
several
lines
of
thinking.
the
first
is
that
they
evidence
the
congressional
notion
that
the
board
did
not
have
the
power
under
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
to
deal
with
minority
picketing
as
it
has
in
this
case.
and
that
congress
now,
for
the
first
time,
has
supplied
that
deficiency.
a
second
line
of
thought
is
that
congress
has
not
attempted
to
determine
whether
or
not,
the
board
had
this
power
to
regulate
minority
picketing
for
recognition
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
but
now,
has
sought
to
--
has
displaced
whatever
power
the
board
may
have
had
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
has
displaced
it
and
for
--
now
has
--
and
section
8
(b)
(1)
--
8
(b)
(7)
provides
the
sole
and
exclusive
method
for
regulating
this
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
were
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
three
altogether.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and,
of
course,
there
are
--
or
--
either
were
three
rather,
but
in
one
of
them,
in
the
ninth
circuit
case,
in
the
alloy
case
which
is
presently
pending
before
this
court,
the
court
did
not
deal
with
the
picketing
aspect
of
the
case,
it
dealt
with
some
other
aspect
of
the
case
involving
black
listed,
but
those
were
the
three
cases
when
8
(b)
(7)
was
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
was
adopted.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
curtis
in
the
court
below
or
sullivan
or
the
rubber
workers
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
alloy
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
that's
the
point
that
i
was
bringing
up.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
they
were.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
have
it
here
somewhere.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
alling
--
alling
&
cory
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
the
name
of
the
company,
but
i
would
say
union.
i
have
not
forgotten
the
name
of
the
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
teamsters.
that
--
that's
right.
now,
i
said
there
were
several
lines
of
--
thinking
about
the
effect
of
8
(b)
(7)
and
i
wanted
to
finish
the
third
one
which
is
ours.
[laughs]
and
that
is
that
again,
congress
has
not
attempted
--
it
did
not
attempt
to
impugn
the
board's
power
to
deal
with
this
thing
here
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
but
that
it
has
passed
8
(b)
(7)
--
8
(b)
(7)
for
the
purpose
of
supplementing,
supplementing
the
board's
power,
supplementing
and
enlarging.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
they've
supplemented,
your
honor,
but
--
for
this
reason
that
8
(b)
(7)
covers
more
than
minority
picketing
for
recognition.
it
covers
picketing
by
either
a
majority
or
minority
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
would
have
covered
this
situation,
that's
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
would've
covered
this
situation
as
it
passed
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
yes.
they
passed
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
--
yes.
if
the
--
if
the
--
the
union
here
was
picketing
within
12
months
of
the
board
election
which
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
if
their
charge
had
been
filed
then
under
8
(b)
(7),
this
would
have
covered
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
no,
no.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
your
honor
of
this
kind.
there
are
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
where
the
board
had
issued
orders.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
some
of
these
cases
are
pending
in
the
various
courts
of
appeals
and
some
of
them
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
has
enforced
the
board's
order.
we
have
the
sullivan
case
from
the
fourth
circuit
is
(inaudible)
and
in
others
like
this
one
here
or
the
second
circuit
case
that
i
referred
to
the
court
of
appeals
has
set
aside,
has
set
aside
those
orders.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
important
to
determine
the
reach
of
the
board's
power
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
because
the
board
believes
that
--
that
the
--
the
new
--
the
new
statute
--
the
new
amendments
do
not
displace
its
powers
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
to
reach
picketing
of
this
kind.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
this
particular
case,
it
would
have
made
not,
but
there
are
cases
where
it
can
make
a
considerable
difference.
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
let
me
explain
if
i
may.
the
--
this
question
here
is
part
of
a
broader
play
and
that
is
whether
the
union
may
use
coercive
economic
weapons
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
recognition,
of
obtaining
recognition
when
it's
a
minority
or
a
stranger
union.
now,
though
these
other
coercive
devices
maybe
such
things
as
the
blacklisting
of
the
employer
appeals
to
consumers
to
boycott
him.
now,
the
board
has
held
in
the
cases
pending
before
this
court
on
petition
for
certiorari,
the
board
has
held
that
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
reaches
that
kind
of
course.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
case
will
go
very
far
towards
deciding
those
cases.
the
decision
of
this
case
will
go
very
far
in
deciding
--
in
deciding
those
cases.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
it
can.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no.
not
--
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
or
would
--
either
that
8
(b)
(7)
would
not
be
practical
to
apply
to
a
situation
where
it
wouldn't
be
practical
to
apply
to
it
or
situations
where
it
didn't
apply
at
all.
let
me
explain
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
explain
that
if
i
may,
your
honor.
now,
as
i've
said,
section
8
(b)
(7)
makes
it
illegal
to
picket,
to
force
or
require
recognition
of
the
employers
to
join
in
three
situations.
one,
where
the
employer
is
lawfully
recognizing
another
union,
there
of
course,
the
picketing
would
be
bad
from
its
inception.
it
would
be
legal.
we
could
move
in
with
an
injunction
against
that
sort
of
picketing.
the
second
situation
is
where
the
--
within
12
months
of
the
board
election
if
there
is
a
picketing
or
recognition
or
you
get
the
employers
to
join
within
12
months,
there
too
we
can
move
in.
but
if
the
last
section,
section
8
(b)
(7)
(c)
i
believe
it
is,
which
says
that
a
--
when
--where
either
of
these
two
situations
that
i've
just
described
obtains
--
obtains,
that
the
union
may
not
picket
for
a
period
to
exceed
30
days
unless
within
those
30
days,
there
is
a
representation
petition
has
been
filed.
now,
con
--
it
--
it
is
possible
that
under
that
section,
picketing
may
go
on
for
30
days
or
more
whether
it's
there's
a
representation
petition
has
been
filed,
but
there
maybe
situations
where
the
special
circumstances
of
the
situation
may
make
it
desirable
and
appropriate
for
the
purpose
of
effectuating
the
statutory
policies
to
move
against
picketing
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
from
its
very
inception.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
could
go
on
and
picket
for
30
days
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
provided
that
in
those
30
days,
there
was
a
representation
petition
filed.
now,
under
8
(b)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
within
--
it
would
have
here
--
it
would
have
30
days
within
which
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
here,
they
were
within
12
months
of
the
election.
they
would
have
been
reached
under
the
second
--
under
the
second
provision
of
7
--
section
8
(b)
(7).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
if
this
statute,
if
section
8
(b)
(7)
as
the
board
believes,
merely
supplement
--
well,
if
you're
suggesting
that
8
(b)
(7)
displaces
--
displaces
the
board's
power
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
your
honor,
this
union
had
violated
the
law,
if
we
are
correct
in
our
reading
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
it
violates
the
law
and
we're
sustained
in
that
view,
then,
we're
entitled
to
have
this
order
enforced
and
that's
been
set
aside
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
are
other
cases
that
are
pending.
there
are
at
least
--
the
board
itself
has
a
dozen
or
more
cases
and
there
are
number
of
cases
pending
in
various
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
not
unless,
no.
those
charges
were
filed
those
under
the
old
law.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
"well,
there
would
have
to
be
new
charges
under
the
new
act
and
of
course,
the
picketing
would
have
to
be
continuing
in
order
to
avoid
the
six
months
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right,
sir.
that's
right.
now,
as
i
was
--
when
the
court
arose,
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
whether
congress
by
passing
this
new
legislation
has
indicated
at
the
board
did
not
have
this
power
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
to
reach
this
kind
of
picketing.
i
don't
believe
--
we
don't
believe
that
congress
made
that
judgment
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
were
a
number
of
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
were
a
number
of
amendments
and
i'm
not
--
not
sufficient
familiar
your
honor
to
answer
that
specific
--
that
--
that
specific
question.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
perhaps
he
can.
but
i
am
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
there
had
been
others
offered
over
a
number
of
years
but
they
have
been
very
extensive
kind
amendments
reaching
both
organizational
and
the
so-called
recognition
picketing.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
no.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no.
as
a
matter
fact,
it
didn't
go
any
far
enough.
the
senate
--
the
senate
had
no
provision
in
--
in
its
bill
--
in
the
kennedy-ervin
bill
had
no
provision
governing
this
sort
of
thing.
then,
the
house
committee
--
the
house
committee
had
a
bill
and
it
was
criticized
by
--
it
was
criticized
as
not
going
far
enough
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
--
not
going
far
enough
in
--
in
dealing
with
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
criticism
was
put
in
those
terms,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
have
matter
--
i
don't
know.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
now,
the
--
i
have
said
that
--
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
suggested
that
at
the
time
that
these
amendments
were
passed,
there
was
no
--
the
court
--
i
have
suggested
that
there
was
no
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
judge
the
board's
power
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
and
the
situation
was
this
that
two
courts
of
appeals,
the
fourth
circuit,
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
--
court
of
appeals
below
have
reached
in
50
answers
on
this
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
stated,
he's
wrong
with
the
very
words
of
one
of
the
dissenters.
the
law
was
uncertain.
this
court
had
granted
certiorari
in
--
in
this
case
and
congress
did
not
attempt
--
was
not
attempting
to
determine
this
issue
but
is
simply
wanted
to
make
sure
that
whatever
the
outcome
of
this
litigation,
the
board
would
have
some
power
to
deal
with
both
organization
and
recognition
picketing.
now,
further,
the
board
believes
that
section
8
(b)
(7)
does
not
displace
whatever
authority
--
the
authority
which
we
claim
that
we
have
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
but
that
its
supplements
and
adds
to
it
because
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
as
we
read
it,
reaches
only
minority
picketing.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
--
i
won't
know
as
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
supplements
in
this
sense,
your
honor,
that
8
(b)
(7)
(d)
is
not
only
with
in
picketing
by
a
minority
union
for
purposes
of
recognition,
it
deals
with
picketing
by
any
kind
of
a
union
for
purposes
of
either
organization
organizing
the
employers
or
for
purposes
of
obtaining
recognition.
now,
and
the
board
believes,
the
board
believes
that
this
statute
sought
to
preserve
the
board's
power
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
to
reach
this
kind
of
minority
picketing
and
that
this
purpose
is
evidenced
by
the
--
by
the
savings
clause
of
8
(b)
(7).
and
the
savings
clause
provides
that
this
is
on
page
67
of
our
brief
at
the
very
bottom,
nothing
in
this
paragraph
shall
be
construed
to
permit
any
act
which
would
otherwise
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
this
section
8
(b).
now,
the
board
reads
that
certain
sentence
as
ordered
to
mean
that
--
that
whatever
power
the
board
have,
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
to
deal
with
minority
picketing
is
not
displaced
by
this
statute.
now,
finally,
i
want
to
turn
to
a
statement
that
appears
in
the
conference
report
on
the
1959
amendments.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
there
isn't
and
i'm
coming
to
the
conference
report
your
honor
which
is
perhaps
the
only
bit
of
history
that
we've
got
on
this
and
that
is
the
conference
report
on
these
amendments
--
this
is
as
quoted
at
page
59
of
our
brief
at
the
bottom.
the
conference
report
had
this
sentence.
section
8
(b)
(7)
overruled
the
curtis
and
alloy
cases
to
the
extent
that
those
decisions
are
inconsistent
with
section
8
(b)
(7).
but
if
the
court
please,
the
statute
has
itself
as
many
ambiguities
and
i'm
afraid
this
sentence
is
as
much
if
not
more
ambiguous
in
the
state
--
in
the
statute
itself.
but,
as
we
read
this
--
this
sentence
and
i'm
not
so
sure
if
there
is
any
other
legislative
history
that
you
--
that
(inaudible)
or
reading
of
it.
i
will
finish
in
just
one
moment
your
honor,
as
we
read
this
--
this
statement,
congress
--
the
conference
report
or
congress
was
simply
saying
the
credit
--
the
force
of
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
accordance
to
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
alloy
case
have
indicated
the
board
doesn't
have
the
power
to
deal
with
minority
picketing
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
for
purposes
of
recognition.
we
are
overruling
those
cases
and
i
am
now
--
and
they're
supplying
and
they're
supplying
whatever
deficiencies
they
may
have
been
but
we're
not
determining,
we're
not
determining
whether
or
not
the
board
did
or
did
not
have
the
power
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
picketing
under
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
thank
you.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
thank
you.
