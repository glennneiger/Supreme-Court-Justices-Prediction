mr.
thatcher,
i
wonder
if
i
heard
correctly,
i
understood
mr.
manoli
to
say
that
the
perry-norville
case
was
the
only
case
in
--
in
which
the
board
maintained
--
sustained
the
position
that
you
now
advocate
here
and
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there
were
some
six
cases
following
the
perry-norville
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl

yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren

is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
those
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
--
would
you?
and
of
course
mr.
manoli
if
you
have
any
counter
opinions,
you
may
cite
those.
