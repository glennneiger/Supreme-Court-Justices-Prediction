mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
the
position
of
the
labor
board
here
but
not
of
the
solicitor
general
as
i
understand
his
position
from
his
plight
of
petitions
of
--
to
the
petitions
for
certiorari
in
the
rubber
workers
case,
he
believes
that
the
new
law,
8
(b)
(7)
or
the
new
law
disposes
of
this
case
and
disposes
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
the
rubber
workers
case
or
sullivan
hill,
the
number
of
which
set
forth
in
our
--
in
our
brief
here
i
can
get
it
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
you
would
held
up
on
that
i
think,
no
action
in
that
case
or
in
alloy.
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
that
the
new
law
dispose
of
all
these
cases,
but
it's
the
position
of
the
board
at
least
here
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
he
specifically
indicated
that
in
court
that
authority
before
a
new
law
has
passed
which
disposes
of
an
issue
pending
before
the
court
that
--
and
in
a
particular
order
before
a
court
that
the
court
had
power
or
the
board
would
have
power
to
so
modify
its
order
and
to
conform
to
--
to
the
new
law
and
then
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
pardon?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
he
wanted
the
cases
sent
as
that,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
there
were
legislative
proposals
in
both
the
house
and
senate
which
would
have
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
at
--
in
1959
during
the
discussions
and
during
the
proposals
for
a
law
dealing
with
recognition
and
organizational
picketing
by
minority
unions,
the
subject
we
have
here,
there
were
proposals
and
they're
set
forth
in
our
brief
which
would've
gone
farther
--
further
than
8
(b)
(7)
now
goes
which
would've
been
included
for
instance
all
picketing
for
recognition
or
for
organizational
purposes
by
any
union,
any
union
which
represented
less
than
30%
of
an
employer's
employees.
that,
a
particular
additional
restriction
i
remember
was
included
in
several
bills.
now,
they
made
--
may
have
been
more.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
but
that
was
proposed
and
rejected.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
would've
covered
it
this
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
would've
covered
the
situation
here
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
--
your
honor,
it
would
have
if
that
union
as
here
represented
less
than
30%
of
the
employer's
employees.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
picketing
the
sort
of
proposal,
proposal
which
exceeded
what
8
(b)
(7)
did,
yes.
this
act
--
this
act
which
was
passed
would
have
precluded
or
prohibited
the
picketing
here
had
to
go
on
for
one
hour
because
the
picketing
followed
an
election
which
the
union
had
lost
and
this
law
proscribes
picketing
to
secure
recognition
in
the
face
of
that
circumstance.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
7
does,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
b
is
set
forth
in
the
board's
brief
page
67,
subsection
(b)
where
it
was
in
appreciating
12
months
the
ballot
election
under
9
(c)
had
been
conducted.
reading
that
was
--
was
the
substantive
language
in
7
where
it
means
unlawful
to
picket
specifically
for
purposes
of
recognition.
so,
clearly,
the
picketing
here
would've
been
--
could've
been
enjoined
within
one
hour
after
it
commenced.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no.
it's
--
it's
prohibited
in
three
specific
areas
and
they're
rather
broad
areas.
the
first
is
where
the
--
the
employer
is
recognizing
or
dealing
with
the
union
whether
it
is
certified
or
not
that
it
has
a
right
to
deal
with,
but
it
already
had
a
contract
for
instance
even
though
that
union
hasn't
been
certified.
in
that
case,
picketing
is
instantly
enjoinable.
then
the
second
instance
is
where
there
has
been
an
election
within
the
previous
12
months.
there
picketing
can
be
instantly
enjoined.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
(b)
and
third,
(c),
in
where
those
two
situations
don't
exist
which
often
happen,
then,
picketing
can
go
on
for
a
reasonable
period
not
to
exceed
30
days.
the
case
was
decided
three
--
three
or
four
days
ago
in
the
district
court
up
in
connecticut
where
picketing
was
enjoined
after,
it's
been
12
or
15
days
of
the
--
and
no
petition
had
even
filed.
so,
the
courts
already
are
reading
this
to
perhaps
prohibit
picketing
within
a
period
much
less
than
30
days,
even
(c).
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no.
the
--
the
injunction
could've
been
obtained
within
an
hour
after
picketing
started,
that's
what
i
meant
to
say.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes.
under
(a)
and
(b)
of
the
present
statute
no
matter
how
short
the
picketing
may
have
been
carried
on,
one
hour
is
sufficient
time
for
the
picketing
to
have
been
carried
on,
and
then
the
board
can
go
into
court
and
get
an
injunction.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
that
was
one
of
the
proposals.
there
was
a
further
proposal
from
that
which
would
instantly
have
prohibited
picketing.
and
then,
in
any
situation
where
the
union
did
not
represent
more
than
30%,
is
that
what
your
honor
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
is
this
meant
to
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
board
is
required
or
the
general
counsel
for
the
board
is
required
to
go
onto
court
to
seek
an
injunction
and
he
can
do
that
within
minutes
after
the
picketing
has
started.
so,
that
that
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
now.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
now,
under
8
(c).
under
7
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
oh.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
or
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
would've
been
discretionary
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
would've
been.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
it
would've
not
been.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
there's
that
difference?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
they
do
have
that.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
maybe
correct
your
honor.
there
is
this
an
interesting
better
informal
post
legislative
history
in
the
form
of
an
address
by
professor
cox
who
was
the
adviser
to
senator
kennedy
through
out
this
at
the
university
of
minnesota
i
think
it
is
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
in
which
he
states
that
there
had
been
a
statement
prepared
but
was
distributed
too
late
which
indicated
the
precise
meaning
of
this
last
proviso
which
you
just
read
as
meaning
that
it
--
that
it
protects
only
the
8
(b)
(4)
sections
of
the
act
from
possible
misconstruction
by
virtue
of
the
enactment
of
many
words
in
8
(b)
(7)
and
in
which
it
was
expressly
stated
that
it
was
meant
by
8
(b)
(7)
to
dispose
completely
of
the
litigation
in
curtis,
alloy
and
other
cases.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
--
i
set
that
part
from
the
brief
your
honor
only
to
indicate
the
reasonableness
of
--
of
our
argument
and
position
that
in
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
right.
we
suggest
that
the
same
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
--
it
--
it
certainly
is
not
formal
legislative
history.
it's
not
part
of
the
congressional
--
it's
informal
legislative
history.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
in
the
first
place,
it
doesn't
indicate
whether
they
mean
the
board's
position
and
the
board's
position
is
being
overruled
or
the
court's
decision
in
those
cases
which
is
contrary
to
the
board's
position
which
is
overruled.
what
i
think
they've
meant
is
that,
regardless
of
what
it
--the
board
have
held
--
what
the
court
have
held,
those
decisions
were
overruled
and
this
is
now
the
law
that
curtis
and
alloy
are
now
things
of
the
past
and
that
we
now
have
before
us
8
(b)
(7)
and
that
is
determinative,
that's
our
position
here.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
proceeding,
just
to
restate
now
the
board's
position,
so
the
real
extent
to
which
it
does
go
that
notwithstanding
section
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
of
the
act
which
deals
specifically
with
recognition
picketing,
but
in
a
very
limited
way
and
notwithstanding,
10
solid
years
of
legislative
effort
every
year
in
congress
to
enlarge
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
to
include
the
type
of
picketing
we
have
in
this
case
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
in
1959
after
discussing
the
same
up
and
down
and
back
and
forth
for
months
in
congress
last
summer,
last
spring,
congress
did
finally
draw
the
line
that
seems
--
thought
should
be
drawn,
the
board
states
not
that
it
had
this
authority
all
along.
in
fact,
all
of
these
that
it
had,
this
authority
but
it
had
even
broader
authority.
i
think
the
error
of
the
board's
position
is
implicit
in
its
own
very
statement
and
can
be
shown
within
the
four
corners
of
the
act
itself
about
resorting
to
much
legislative
history.
first,
section
13
had
to
be
paid
a
great
deal
of
attention
to.
this
state
strikes
and
picketing
which
is
equated
with
strikes
by
this
court
in
the
rice
milling
case
and
specifically
by
other
circuits
under
13.
it
states
that
picketing
or
strikes
can
be
proscribed
only
if
it
specifically
provided
for
another
sections
of
the
act.
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
certainly
does
not
by
its
terms
specifically
proscribe
any
concerted
activity
such
as
those
for
instance
section
8
(b)
(4)
which
can
be
said
to
be
a
specific
prohibition
of
picketing
or
striking,
because
it
deals
specifically
with
striking
and
picketing
as
such.
the
section
merely
states
in
a
general
way
that
it's
an
unfair
practice
to
restrain
or
coerce
--
restrain
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
rights
set
forth
in
section
7.
now,
for
nine
solid
years,
the
board
held
that
the
reach
and
the
scope
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
not
to
interdict
or
--
or
condemn
within
the
phrase
coerce
any
aspects
of
peaceful
striking
or
picketing.
perry-norville,
the
nmuk
decided
before
perry-norville
and
six
cases
decided
after
that
time
between
the
time
of
that
first
decision
and
now,
all
held
specifically
that
regardless
of
how
illegal
the
object
might
be,
the
object
of
union's
activities
to
get
a
closed
shop
for
instance
although
a
closed
shop
was
proscribed
by
the
act
or
other
directly
admittedly
illegal
objectives,
nevertheless,
picketing
to
secure
those
objectives
could
not
be
indicted
or
proscribed
under
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
because
peaceful
picketing
could
not
be
deemed
and
was
never
thought
to
be
included
within
the
term
coercion.
now,
for
the
first
time,
the
board
argues
--
argues
flatly
that
because
picketing
has
--
which
we
all
admit,
picketing
has
the
effect
of
attempting
to
reach
an
employer
economically
and
the
board
then
says
that
that
may
reach
the
employees
indirectly
in
their
economic
position
that
the
employer
loses
business.
they
might
suffer
--
in
their
employment
conditions
that
by
that
indirect
means,
there
has
been
a
accomplished
a
coercion
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
coerce
as
set
forth
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
well,
that
was
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i'll
dwell
on
that
at
--
at
a
little
more
length
later.
i'll
answer
you
very
briefly
now
though
your
honor.
a
readymade
and
a
very
traditional
objective
of
union
--
unions
generally
is
reached
by
attempt
by
minority
unions
to
achieve
recognition
and
indeed,
a
contract
with
unorganized
employers
namely,
extending
the
scope
of
organization
beyond
the
single
shop
or
extending
the
scope
of
organizations
--
of
organizations
and
try
to
bargaining
to
reach
all
the
shops
within
an
industry
or
within
an
area
as
a
means
of
eliminating
the
competition
from
the
--
the
wage
--
capital
--
wage
competition
from
the
unorganized
shops.
since
the
beginning
of
trade
union
history,
that's
been
an
objective,
there
has
been
picketing
carried
on
to
that
end
by
minority
unions
since
the
beginning
of
trade
union
history,
this
court
has
protected
it,
the
norris-laguardia
act
has
protected
it,
the
wagner
act
protected
it,
this
act
protects
it
as
i
will
show
later
and
that
is
the
objective
and
the
--
the
matter
which
unions
seek
to
achieve
when
they
engage
in
this
minority
picketing.
that
is
--
is
what
--
that
is
the
portion
of
the
section
7
rights.
section
7
goes
both
to
union
people
and
nonunion
people.
that
is
of
course
in
the
section
7
rights
which
is
we
think
protected
or
preserved
in
the
act
for
unions.
there
maybe
other
matters
in
the
--
in
section
7
of
--
of
--
for
the
nonunion
employers
such
as
the
right
to
engage
in
strike
making
such
activities,
but
they
are
certainly
at
least
are
correlative
rights
and
we
think
if
congress
wanted
to
outlaw
that
traditional
right,
they
would've
not
done
so
by
a
vague,
ambiguous,
broad
sweep
of
an
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
they
would've
gone
after
it
directly
as
they
finally
have
an
8
(b)
(7).
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
your
honor.
in
addition
to
the
general
objective
that
i
just
stated
which
i
think
is
an
extremely
important
one,
there
was
this
further
objective.
the
union
had
won
an
election
in
that
plant
and
it
wanted
rather
substantially
to
engage
in
bargaining.
bargaining
collapsed
on
certain
issues.
a
strike
was
engaged
in.
the
strikers
were
replaced
by
nonstrikers.
the
nonstrikers
or
the
employer,
not
that
the
nonstrikers,
the
employer
at
that
time
called
for
an
election
when
the
people
rather
on
strike
as
it
had
the
right
to
do
on
a
much
criticized
section
of
this
act.
that
election
obviously
was
lost.
does
the
union
thereby
lose
its
right
to
protest
or
to
seek
to
achieve
what
it
thinks
necessary
to
preserve
conditions
in
the
city?
we
think
not.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
there
are
some
six
cases
and
we
can
supply
them
which
held
this
principle.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
and
it
went
all
the
way
up
to
just
before
the
decision
in
this
case
which
upheld
the
principle
that
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
does
not
reach
peaceful
picketing
no
matter
what
the
objective
of
the
picketing
might
be,
whether
admittedly
or
in
the
illegal
objective
including
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
in
some
cases
picketing
by
a
minority
unions
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
minority
union
is
present
in
perry-norville
and
i
think
in
one
or
two
or
the
other.
i'm
not
--
i
can
assure
that,
but
the
basic
principle
at
least
upon
which
the
board
relies
here
namely
that
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
can
include
peaceful
picketing
as
coercive
when
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
is
to
achieve
an
unlawful
objective,
that
principle,
that's
the
basic
principle
here,
that
has
been
flatly
denied
in
at
least
state
board
decisions
running
all
up
to
the
time
of
the
decision
here.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no.
they
--
actually
your
honor,
i'll
be
glad
to
supply
them
following
that.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
now,
as
mr.
manoli
indicated
the
legislative
history
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
is
the
--
you
can
point
the
statements
either
way,
we
think
the
later
legislative
history
following
the
statements
by
mr.
--
by
senator
taft
has
reported
here
which
occurred
prior
to
the
time
that
the
words
interfere
with
were
taken
out
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
is
originally
proposed
and
it
was
only
in
the
senate
that
it
was
debated
and
prepared
in
the
house.
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
as
it
originally
arose
said
that
there
is
an
awful
interfere
with
restrain
or
coerce.
and
senator
taft
was
speaking
about
this
--
what
he
was
speaking
there
at
that
time
then
interfered
with
--
the
word
“interfere”
was
taken
out
and
after
that,
you'll
find
the
debates
much
more
limited
and
the
fact
that
senator
taft
itself
speaks
about
people
can
now
--
can
patrol
carrying
signs
and
it
can
now
seek
to
organize
by
any
peaceful
means.
he
makes
that
by
statement
too.
but,
the
legislative
history
as
set
forth
at
length
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
think
any
thing
that
will
be
gained
by
discussing
it
here
further.
i
--
i
think
so
that
we
take
8
(b)
(a)
--
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
read
with
the
prohibition
in
section
13
that
the
act
can't
--
that
broad
phases
in
the
act
can't
be
read
to
proscribe
picketing
that
proscriptions
have
to
be
flatly
stated
or
specifically
set
forth
in
the
act.
if
you
read
those
two
together,
i
think
there
alone,
we
have
an
answer
to
the
board's
entire
argument
here
but
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
you're
--
you're
right
your
honor.
the
section
13
speaks
only
of
strikes
--
striking.
but
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
right,
your
honor,
but
this
court
had
a
case
at
length
to
consider
section
13
on
its
application
in
the
rice
milling
case,
that's
set
forth
in
our
brief
here.
that
case
involved
a
--
a
situation
were
picketing
alone
was
involved,
picketing
of
a
plant
which
was
not
organized
or
where
--
where
none
of
the
employees
were
on
strike,
not
a
single
one
was
on
strike
and
this
court
protected
that
picketing
within
using
section
13
as
the
means
of
protecting
that
picketing.
there
are
other
circuit
court
decisions
set
forth
in
our
brief
here,
in
which
the
courts
have
held
one
is
the
campbell
(inaudible)
in
the
court
of
appeals
law
here
in
which
the
court
have
held
that
picketing
as
such
is
directly
embraced
within
section
13
of
the
act.
the
board
was
held
so
within
the
term
“striking”
in
section
13
of
the
act.
the
board
was
held
so
in
many
decisions
and
i
don't
--
and
they
haven't
controverted
that
proposition
in
the
brief
here
and
i
don't
understand
until
now.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
when
the
trouble
first
arose,
they
represented
all
of
them.
nine
went
out
on
strike
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
there
is
a
continuing
strike.
there
was
a
--
the
strike
which
gave
rise
to
this
whole
trouble
and
which
resulted
in
the
replacement
of
the
strikers
and
then
the
following
election,
that
was
the
continuing
strike.
they
never
stop
picketing
pursuant
to
that
strike.
we
have
the
strike
here
at
all
times.
even
if
we
have
only
one
--
one
man
still
left,
there's
still
a
strike
and
they
still
were
seeking
to
--
to
get
their
contracts
which
they
never
did
get
following
the
certification.
so
we
have
a
strike,
but
it's
--
it's
clear
that
picketing
is
--
can
be
equated
with
striking
under
section
13
and
the
board
doesn't
controvert
that
here.
but
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
think
that
the
--
the
key
to
this
whole
litigation
and
the
key
to
this
case
is
section
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
and
then
even
more
strongly
section
8
(b)
(7).
in
8
(b)
(4)
(c),
congress
have
before
it
the
specific
subject
of
picketing
by
minorities
or
by
unions
for
recognition.
and
at
--
at
the
first
proposal
broadly
prohibited
all
picketing
for
recognition
unless
the
union
had
a
certification
and
the
debate
from
the
proposal
ran
the
whole
gamut
up
and
down
from
the
most
extreme
and
finally,
after
much
debate,
congress
came
out
with
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
which
restricted
recognition
picketing
only
in
a
very
narrow
area.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
that's
set
forth
in
our
--
our
brief.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
proposal
of
which
sought
to
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
was
the
original
taft-hartley
act
in
1947
in
which
there
was
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
--
that
8
(b)
(7)
that
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
i'm
coming
to
that
later.
i'll
give
you
a
legislative
history
on
that
shortly.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
the
act.
the
landrum-griffin
bill
was
the
bill
in
the
house
and
there
were
various
versions
in
this
senate
starting
with
the
kennedy-erwin
bill
and
then
we
finally
came
up
with
8
(b)
(7),
there.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
there
were,
after
8
(b)
(c)
was
enacted,
there
were
nine
solid
years,
each
year
of
which
there
were
attempts
in
congress
to
expand
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
to
include
all
types
of
minority
picketing,
each
time
these
proposals
were
rejected.
we
have
a
joint
committee
report
a
portion
of
which
--
in
which
senator
taft
was
a
member
of
that
committee.
senator
ball,
other
senators
who
took
leading
part
in
the
debates
were
members
of
that
joint
committee
and
that
joint
committee
flatly
stated
that
that
is
in
addition
to
what
mr.
manoli
read,
finally
stated
this
the
taft-hartley
laws,
i
reading
at
page
36
of
my
brief,
the
taft-hartley
law's
only
limitation
upon
minority
of
such
strikes,
minority
strikes
they
were
talking
about
is
that
provided
by
section
8
(b)
(4)
(c).
the
right
to
strike
of
recognition
is
only
foreclosed
when
another
union
has
been
certified.
and
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
union
can
strike
recognition
the
day
after
it
loses
an
election.
that's
the
joint
committee
that
senator
taft,
that
senator
ball's
view,
the
people
that
proposed
and
got
passed
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
and
they
didn't
put
it
on
the
basis
of
board's
decision.
that
is
what
they
regarded
the
law
as
standing
for
it.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
then
--
then
we
come
now
--
then
in
1958,
there
was
a
--
an
even
more
strenuous
effort
to
get
the
legislation
and
appeal
of
recognition
picketing
and
we
set
that
forth
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
but
all
of
those
proposals
were
rejected
finally
in
1958,
including
the
very
8
(b)
--
the
section
8
(b)
(7)
which
finally
was
enacted
in
1959
and
efforts
were
continued
to
1959
and
again,
the
proposals
run
a
whole
gamut
of
prohibition
and
after
a
long
debate,
much
controversy,
and
much
discussion,
congress
finally
came
out
with
section
8
(b)
(4)
with
--
with
section
8
(b)
(7)
which
--
that
means,
anything
that
needed
the
congress
to
take
in
the
matter
in
hand
after
much
study
as
set
what
it
thinks
are
the
proper
boundaries.
it
thinks
now
that
after
there
has
been
an
election,
union
should
not
take
a
bet
now
to
the
law.
but
congress
did
so
by
direct
language
of
proscription.
it
regarded
section
13,
it
--
it
took
a
counter
section
13
and
in
proscribing
recognition
picketing
did
so
by
very
precise
language
and
it
did
so
in
the
very
areas
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
we
think
that's
determinative
of
this
litigation.
there
is
a
very
recent
--
there
is
only
one
decision
since
the
passage
of
the
1959
law
which
takes
up
--
which
discusses
the
effect
of
the
1959
law
on
the
board's
position
in
this
case
namely
that
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
also
can
be
used
to
--
to
enjoin
minority
picketing.
and
the
second
circuit's,
it's
the
board
versus
teamsters
local
182,
case
is
decided
november
27,
not
reported
yet
except
in
l.r.r.m.
and
we've
got
the
citation
in
our
brief,
the
court
unanimously
rejected
the
board's
reasoning
here
and
said,
of
course,
congress
has
taken
this
matter
in
hand
and
--
but
it
--
it
is
now
enacted
and
this
is
the
law
and
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
cannot
be
used
to
permit
the
board
to
have
a
(inaudible)
commission
to
--
to
deal
with
other
unregulated
areas
of
recognition
picketing.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
pardon?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it's
in
our

i
have
in

it's

it's

it's

it's

mr.

mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
45
l.r.r.m.
2205,
set
forth
on
page
54
in
filing
of
our
brief.
now
--
now,
coming
out
of
the
answer
to
some
of
the
board's
contentions
here
on
the
policy
--
in
the
policy
area
namely
that
we're
seeking
to
interfere
with
employees'
rights
not
to
join
unions
and
we're
seeking
to
reply
our
employers
to
commit
unfair
practices.
but
to
answer
that,
we've
got
to
go
back
a
little
--
a
little
--
to
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
and
to
other
enactments
in
the
field
of
federal
legislation
in
the
field
of
labor
relations,
bearing
in
mind
the
administrative
court
in
u.s.
versus
hutchinson.
perhaps,
we
have
to
consider
all
of
these
federal
laws
in
the
labor
field
of
the
comprehensive
code
to
see
this
what
--
how
the
congress
considers
and
regards
the
various
rights
that
are
asserted
from
time
to
time.
as
i
indicated
in
an
answer
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
whittaker,
it
is
traditionally
since
the
beginning
of
trade
union
history
than
the
customer
practice
of
unions
to
seek
to
extend
organization
beyond
the
single
shot.
to
seek
to
get
all
within
an
all
industries,
all
trades,
all
shops,
within
an
area
organized
to
prevent
the
–
the
wage
competition
from
the
nonunion
shop,
the
wage
competition
for
the
nonunion
shop.
that
principle
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
american
steel
foundries
case
chief
justice
when
mr.
taft
was
chief
justice.
in
the
apex
case,
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice
roberts
both
dealing
with
antitrust,
sherman
act
and
clayton
act
attempts
to
--
to
prevent
unions
from
picketing
by
--
in
--
in
--
the
minority
situations
that
we
have
here
and
the
court
--
this
court
expressed
its
understanding
of
the
principle
of
attempting
to
spread
organization
by
minority
picketing.
in
a
swing
case,
this
court
expressed
similar
views
in
connection
by
the
free
speech
considerations.
the
norris-laguardia
act,
section
104
and
section
113
(e)
specifically
protects
minority
picketing
for
recognition
from
the
injunction
process
at
least.
and
in
this
connection,
we
refer
the
court
to
the
fur
workers
case,
we
have
it
cited
in
our
brief,
affirmed
here
where
there
was
minority
picketing
and
on
that
premise
alone,
an
injunction
was
sought
and
no
minority
picketing
for
recognition
and
the
court
denied
it.
and
then
in
these
same
sections
to
the
norris-laguardia
act
which
protected
as
against
injunctions,
the
past
picketing
we
had
--
we
had
here
before
the
1959
amendments
were
carried
on
to
the
both
the
wagner
act
and
to
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
right.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
i'm
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
the
argument
is
that
the
board
was
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
but
--
that's
right.
but
these
rights
which
are
recognized
by
the
congress,
have
been
recognized
by
this
court.
and
i
think
of
congress
before
1959
and
1947,
congress
wanted
to
--
also
that
right
or
restrict
it
in
any
way
would
done
so
by
direct
language.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
what
i
--
but
of
course
we
(inaudible)
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
--
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
needed
to
deny
that
for
a
minute.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
of
course,
i
think
it
was
to
get
recognition
and
a
contract.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
depends
on
whether
coercion,
the
term
coercion
as
used
in
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
can
be
said
or
read
to
include
peaceful
picketing.
up
to
this
case,
it
never
has
been
--
congress
never
--
up
until
1959,
never
considered
peaceful
picketing
as
being
coercive
or
admittedly
has
--
it
brings
economic
pressure
on
employer
and
then
maybe
on
employees
and
the
board
for
nine
solid
years
specifically
held
that
picketing
cannot
--
peaceful
picketing
cannot
be
held
to
the
coercion.
that
all
of
it
was
embraced
within
the
term
“coercion”
was
physical
violence,
mass
picketing,
beating,
things
like
that.
and
the
legislative
history
is
replete
--
is
very
illuminating
on
that
aspect
also
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
argue
this
your
honor
that
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
“coerced”
as
used
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
that
takes
violence
in
fact
or
threat
of
violence
in
the
fact
or
some
means
of
direct
retaliation
against
an
employer
--
against
union
--
against
nonunion
people
or
employees
something
other
and
in
addition
and
involving
some
more
element
of
intimidation
than
peaceful
picketing.
peaceful
picketing
has
never
in
the
long
history
of
litigation
on
this
subject
and
been
considered
per
se
coercive
and
that
in
the
intimidatory
sense.
it
has
been
recognized
as
having
consequences,
economic
consequences
in
bringing
pressures,
yes.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
right.
but
if
--
again,
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
not
concerned
with
purposes.
it
was
concerned
with
means,
not
purposes.
it
was
concern
primarily
with
-
-with
means
of
interference
and
purposes
of
strikes
and
so
on
were
directly
on
8
(b)
(4)
where
objectives
were
spelled
out
as
being
unlawful
and
where
striking
was
spelled
out.
picketing
was
spelled
out
as
being
dealt
with
unlike
the
situation
on
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
now,
the
--
the
only
reason
i
am
reciting
all
this
norris-laguardia
act
in
the
history
and
to
carry
on
of
those
protection
during
the
wagner
act
and
taft-hartley
is
to
show
that
congress
did
consider
minority
picketing
a
protected
activity
and
certainly,
at
the
very
least,
if
it
up
until
that
time,
up
to
the
time
of
taft-hartley,
the
very
least
it
would've
done
if
it
didn't
want
to
consider
protected
anymore
would
be
to
out
--
outlaw
it
specifically
and
that
it
did
not
do.
and
it
did
not
do
that
until
1959
when
it
did
it
at
great
length
in
section
8
(b)
(7).
there
are
two
other
factors
in
conclusion
which
would
acquire
any
court
to
go
slow
and
broadly
extending
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
in
addition
to
section
13,
we
had
section
8
(c)
of
the
act
which
protects
the
right
of
peaceful
picketing
under
the
act
unless
specifically
proscribed.
again
picketing
which
is
an
aspect
to
free
speech
is
not
specifically
proscribed
under
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
finally,
we
have
the
overall
considerations
stressed
so
strongly
by
this
court
in
the
hot
cargo
case
that
the
(inaudible)
american
iron
cases
which
is
that
since
taft-hartley
is
the
product
of
better
compromise,
better
argument
in
which
strongly
contending
forces
were
pressing
for
their
various
positions,
the
court
should
go
extremely
slow
and
should
be
extremely
reluctant
to
extend
the
scope
of
the
act
merely
by
construction
and
were
not
clearly
commanded
by
expressed
language.
we
have
no
such
express
language
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
thank
you,
your
honor.
