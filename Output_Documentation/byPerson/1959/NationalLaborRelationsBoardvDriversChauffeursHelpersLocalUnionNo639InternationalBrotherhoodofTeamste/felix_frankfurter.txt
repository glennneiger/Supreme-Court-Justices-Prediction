have
to
give
me
a
--
a
preview
of

argue

the
statement.
are
you
saying
that
the
amendments
have
left
the
matter
wholly
unchanged?
are
you
saying
the
amendments
are
neutral
or
are
you
saying
is
anything
that
points
your
way
or
against
your
way?

get
rid
of
these
pickets
and
therefore,
i
would
recognize
the
union,
that's
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
(c)
come
into
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
you
happen
to
know
as
a
matter
of
chronology
whether
the
quotations
that
you
gave
us
from

to
the

in
after
(c),
was
later
than
the
(c)
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
later
--
and
these
utterances
by
senator
taft?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
i
misconveyed
my
question.
justice

these
utterances
were
made
by
senator

after
(c)
was
already
in
the
proposed
bill.
justice

(voice

--
justice

justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
a
certified
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whereas
the
--
what
you
are
arguing
is
in
relation
to
a
desire
to
become
--
of
majority
to
become
a
recognized
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
might
the
--
both
as
justice
brennan
suggests
or
might
be
a
rival
union?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
raised
that
already
a
legal
voice
for
the
men.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

you
say
specifically
provided
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
section
13
doesn't
mean
as
much
as
you
spelled
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought,
you
said
the
question
was
--
i
thought
you
indicated
that
the
case
that
you
present
this
situation
that
they
talked
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
justice
black's
further
questioning
of
you
to
lead
you
to
say
that
the
board
held
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
i
believe
--
i
just
want
to
know
whether
there
was
any.
has
there
been
a
decision
of
the
board,
apart
from
what
you
said
that
they
say
in
which
they
dealt
with
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
black's
question.
the
matter
had
or
as
i
did
not
understand
your
answer.
did
it
or
did
it
not
come
before
the
court
--
the
board
and
then
the
board
take
action?
or
did
you
indicate
as
i
heard
you
that
in
view
of
the
ruling
of
the
general
counsel
has
never
came
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
didn't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
board
initiate
--
suppose
the
board
--
did
the
board
know
about
the
rulings
of
general
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
board
legally
can't
do
anything
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
is
the
initiating
prosecutorial
or
--
or
a
complaining
body?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
doesn't
issue
a
complaint?
he
can't
get
before
--
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
purpose
--
that
continues
to
be
the
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
has
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

about
as
whether
he
should
be
an
independent
problem
in
that
way,
hasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
this
annually,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
this
annually,
doesn't
it,
or
more
or
less?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
out
of
the
commission?
justice
felix

members
of
both
houses
(voice

--
justice
felix

what's
the
name
of
the
second
circuit
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
name
of
the
second
circuit
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
bother
--
don't
bother.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
teamsters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
the
situation
that
if
your
claim
and
the
new
--
the
provision
of
the
new
act
that
you
read
on
the
generality
of
condemnation
of
unfair
labor
practice
by
invoking
the
purposes
of
the
act
regarding
the
free
bargaining
and
the
provision
that
the
new
act
makes
is
a
specific
dealing
with
the
segment
of
their
thought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
wanted
it
sent
back?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
wanted
the
case
is
sent
back
to
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
thatcher,
the
amendment
which
you
say
was
proposed
and
rejected
it
would've
allowed
what
you
call
an
injunction
and
order
if
it
lasted
only
an
hour
or
a
day,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh!
no
matter
how
short
the
period
of
picketing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
the
statute
as
i
understand
you,
the
statute
would've
made
no
limitation
such
as
it
now
makes,
is
that
right,
such
is
made
on
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
--
if
it
lasted
only
a
few
minutes,
you
could've
rush
before
the
board
under
the
mandate
of
the
statute
it
didn't
put
any
conduit,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is
whether
now,
the
complaint
under
--
under
what
the
board
now
is
urging,
the
--
a
written
discretion
regarding
the
length
and
nature
of
the
picketing
that
was
(inaudible)
the
counsel
to
take
notice
of
and
bring
by
way
of
complaint
for
the
board,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
statute
is
mandatory
because
it
doesn't
say
--
i
mean,
unfair
labor
practice
and
they
have
to
decide
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean,
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
8
(b)
(7)
contention?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
7
(c).
i'm
talking
about
--
forget
7
(c).
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
--
under
the
legal
view
of
the
board
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
the
general
counsel
has
discretion
what
complaint
he
will
file
before
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would've.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
the
amendment
which
was
rejected
as
such,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you
got
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
also
a
provision
that
nothing
in
paragraph
(c)
shall
be
construed
to
permit
any
act
which
would
otherwise
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
so,
that
might
imply,
at
least
my
reading
of
it
implies
that
there
must
be
act
which
is
otherwise
be
an
unfair
labor
practices,
although,
this
had
--
the
order
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
we
not
going
to
include
among
legislative
history
the
speech
by
somebody
whom
i
respect
gratefully
apart
from
the
fact
that
he
is
been
student
of
mine,
are
we
going
to
include
among
legislative
practice
or
the
speech
made
by
professor
cox
months
later
including
the
statement
of
(inaudible)
need
an
ample
time
i
think
on
the
floor
and
ask
some
of
these
statements
made
by
senator
walsh
which
he
did
argue
senatorial
sponsor
to
reply
to
it.
are
we
going
to
include
that
on
the
legislative
history?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
wondering
whether
that's
part
of
the
legislative
history
and
you
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
great
reporting
of
the
--
report
of
the
legislative
adviser
(inaudible)
attempt.
are
we
going
that
far
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
statute
in
this
argument
that
i'm
about
to
sustain
comment
on
it
bears
directly
on
our
problem,
but
there
is
no
contradiction
between
things
that
the
effort
is
suggesting
to
organize
the
whole
(inaudible)
and
this
unit
of
it
in
order
to
--
you
have
to
get
this
unit
also
here
in
order
accomplish
what
you
say
is
one
of
the
purposes
and
that
by
doing
that
you
also
get
recognition
if
you
can
get
to
organize
that
shop
or
that
factory,
then,
there
will
be
majority
in
the
strike
and
they
also
have
increase
the
range
of
the
union's
domain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
explain
two
things
up
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
use
together.
i
mean,
just
to
the
matter
of
investigative
fact,
i
don't
see
what's
the
--
what
would
be
the
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
the
argument
is
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
relevance
here.
i'm
saying
of
course,
it
has
two
purpose
namely
to
--
to
organize
that
shop
and
thereby,
you
increase
the
rate
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
answer
of
that
is
part
of
the
argument.
i
just
don't
see
why
you
don't
say
why
a
court
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
you're
arguing
either
