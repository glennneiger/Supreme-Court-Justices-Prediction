justice

what
became
of
judge
wyzanski,
talk
about
this
having
been
the
complain
of
condition,
having
been
brought
about
by
our
joint-venturer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
on
page
51
to
52,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
--
that's
why
it
sought
it
should
have
been
a
directive
verdict
based
on
the
joint-venturer
ground,
wasn't
it?
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
what
he
meant
was
that
[laughs]
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
directed
verdict
if
he
didn't
direct
because
of
this
joint
venture
argument
of
his.
and
my
curiosity
is
aroused
by
--
i
wonder
what
--
what
happens
--
what
basis
for
that
is
and
what
happened
to
that
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
mean
argued
here
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
basis
for
--
that
basis
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
had
some
cases,
have
we
not,
mr.
katz,
come
into
this
court
involving
this
joint
venture
acquisition
or
interpretation
of
the
relation
of
the
crew
to
the
earnings
of
the
trip
or
the
per.
in
other
connection,
not
in
this
connection,
determine
all
these
and
so
on,
does
not
have
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

everything
was
taking
[laughs]
judicial
notice
of
what
the
custom
of
--
of
this
kind
of
a
fishing
enterprise
is
in
your
waters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i
asked
you
of
sheer
curiosity
because
i
didn't
find
any
--
any
other
reference
except
the
first
ground
of
the
--
the
answer
to
the
argument
that
might
be
made
at
this
day.
and
i
was
wondering
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
and
what
happens
to
it,
and
you've
explained
its
sense
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
serve
at
the
--
simply
become
a
seaman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
must
not
get
into
the
servitude,
free
not
to
get
into
the
service
of
the
vessel,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose,
i
must
said
if
i
become
a
judge
of
this
court.
i
suppose
you
must
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
serve
as
a
lawyer
to
become
a
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
disagree
with
judge
magruder
that
while
there's
in
language
in
these
cases,
the
cases
on
the
fact,
plenty
of
language,
the
cases
on
the
fact,
did
not
have
to
face
issues
that
he
thought
he
had
to
face
in
this
case,
what
is
to
do
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
magruder
recognizes
that
all
the
--
recognizes
the
language,
that
there
was
language
in
terms
of
absolute
liability
in
the
cases
which
--
to
which
you
refer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
his
analysis
of
the
cases
is
this,
that
in
none
of
the
cases
was
the
issue
faced
was
--
did
the
facts
require
an
examination
of
the
basis
of
the
liability
regarding
the
differentiation
that
he
makes
between
the
vessel
being
seaworthy,
when
it
sets
out
and
conditions
arising
subsequently
which
could
not
be
--
which
--
which
it
could
not
be
dealt
with
except
on
notice
or
opportunity
to
deal
with
it.
you
deny
that
--
i'm
not
now
saying
that
--
that
he
himself
recognized
it
in
his
phrase
you
can't
brush
off
or
talk
like
that,
but
you
deny
that
on
the
examination
of
the
--
of
the
facts
in
each
of
the
cases
which
he
discusses
and
to
which
you
refer
the
fact,
one
of
these
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
not
be
so,
what
i'm
asking
you
is
whether
it
wasn't
so
whether
the
decisions
in
those
cases
deal
--
did
deal
with
supervening
occurrences
after
the
vessels
that
are
underway.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
he
did
and
i'm
asking
you
whether
you
think
he
unfairly
dealt
with
them
on
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
maybe
so.
you
may
--
you
may
agree
with
everything
he
says
and
yet
reach
the
opposite
conclusion
but
this
opinion
of
his
challenges
inquiry
into
the
basis
of
this
talk
about
absolute
liability.
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
saying
he's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
he
is
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
is
important
intellectually
to
find
out
whether
his
discussion
has
a
foundational
sense,
doesn't
it?
the
foundation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
say
that,
he
says
that
is
dictum
which
is
a
different
thing.
there
are
lots
of
talk
in
cases
which
do
--
are
not
necessitated
by
the
facts
in
the
case,
not
maybe
that
the
dictum
has
become
law
or
should
become
law.
what
i'm
trying
to
pursue
with
you,
the
validity
of
his
inquiry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
gilmore
and
black
also
a
question.
what
was
said
in
osceola
as
against
what
was
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
you're
denying
you're
about
to
begin
doing
what
judge
magruder
suggest
one
does,
namely,
examine
the
basis
of
liability
and
on
the
basis
of
such
an
examination
reach
a
conclusion,
it
is
founded
on
reason
and
policy
rather
than
the
repetition
of
what
he
conceives
to
be
a
mere
dictum.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
know
the
case
of
dixon
against
the
united
states
where
the
second
circuit
examine
the
pros
and
cons
of
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it
didn't
reach
a
conclusion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
give
--
you
only
give
him
one
half
of
the
consideration
besides
talking
about
the
seaman
side,
there
is
another
side,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
other
side
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
whole
liability
without
fault
is
--
is
against
the
general
principle
of
liability
in
anglo-american
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
problem.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
opinion
poses
to
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that's
what
absolute
liability
means?
insurer
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
expound
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
is
--
is
that
different
--
is
that
a
different
way
of
saying,
was
there
a
cause
in
connection
between
the
condition
complained
of
and
the
resulting
injury?
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
judge
can
charge
to
the
jury
in
the
view
of
this
slippery
stuff,
and
it
wasn't
removed,
it
was
removable,
had
no
business
to
be
there,
it
was
the
result
of
the
injury
but
you
may
find
gentlemen
of
the
jury
that
nevertheless
that
didn't
make
the
vessel
unseaworthy,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
think
judge
wyzanski,
if
you
go
back
to
him
on
your
theory,
could
easily
charge
you
out
of
court
on
your
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
desirable
to
have
a
rule
of
law
that
can
be
evaded
that
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
if
you
qualify
to
that
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
it
means
that
is
an
unseaworthy
condition
because
slippery
stuff
on
which
a
seaman
is
running
or
hastily
walking
to
his
post
to
watch
can
naturally
--
were
naturally
fall
but
you
gentlemen
of
the
jury
didn't
find
it
was
unseaworthy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
it
isn't
in
the
case.
you
--
you
say
it
isn't
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
that
he
filed
it
two
weeks
later,
i
should
think
a
judge
can
try
in
two
weeks,
can
write
a
memorandum
spelling
out
the
basis
of
his
ruling
provided
he
doesn't
change
the
basis
of
his
ruling
on
which
the
judgment
was
based.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
be
no
objections
to
his
filing
of
memorandum
in
explication
of
something
that
he
ruled
and
spelling
it
out.
that's
when
we
postpone
sometimes
the
filing
of
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
really
for
you
entirely,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
difficulty
is
not
that
its
two
weeks
late
but
it's
unrelated
to
the
case
as
made
out
at
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
petterson
case
is
a
very
different
case.
that
involves
the
question
whether
or
not
in
the
loading
of
the
ship
by
a
stevedoring
company,
the
so-called
independent
--
that
the
owner
of
the
ship
is
liable
to
the
--
in
so-called
independent
stevedoring
company
employees,
the
stevedore,
in
--
for
loading
the
ship
in
port,
whether
the
doctrine
of
the
owner's
responsibility,
unseaworthiness
is
limited.
he
asked
stevedoring
company
from
the
load
in
port,
that's
a
very
different
question
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
is,
without
going
to
all
the
cases,
he
is
--
was
loading
the
ship
in
port
and
the
question
they
raised
is
the
one
that
this
court
decided
that
the
stevedoring
employees
are
in
fact,
for
purpose
of
seaworthy
liability
or
responsibility,
seaman
at
the
essence
of
that
holding,
at
the
essence
of
the
law
of
this
court
as
to
those
cases.
it
was
a
different
thing
from
the
problem
that
you
rightly
indicated
now,
namely,
whether
the
vessel
a
wholly
seaworthy
vessel
underway
out
in
the
ocean
is
something
happening
transitory
or
something
that
couldn't
possibly
have
been
foreseen
or
mended
whether
the
doctrine
apply
to
that
situation.
i'm
not
suggesting
remotely
that
that
is
all
i'm
suggesting
is
different
cases
should
not
be
accumulated
to
be
the
same
way
because
the
whole
question
is
whether
this
doctrine
should
be
extended
to
a
vessel
that
left
forth
and
is
on
its
own.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
owner
brings
aboard
something
which
isn't
part
of
the
permanent
gear
of
the
ship,
that
wouldn't
leave
him
of
unseaworthiness
responsibility,
would
it?
the
owner
didn't
bring
it
on
the
board
but
the
issue
was
not
the
character
of
the
object
that
should
be
offending
--
brought
about
the
injury
but
who
is
responsible
for
the
injury.
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
issue
--
that's
the
issue
on
which
it
came
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
didn't
come
here
on
this
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
december
1st,
mr.
whipple?
justice
felix
frankfurter
time
may
give
--
time
may
imply
notice
as
to
work?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
afraid
i
am
responsible
for
discussion
of
what
is
an
irrelevant
point
but
i
was
just
curious
how
you
came
to
make
that
memorandum
is
that
what
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
and
if
you
please
irrelevant
because
neither
side
relied
on
that.
that's
not
in
the
case
and
that's
why
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
so
surprised
that
he
should
later
on
say
he
has
the
right
to
be
dependent
on
that
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
when
the
case
came
here,
it
was
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
say
it's
my
fault
for
having
tried
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
on
how
judge
wyzanski
to
use
the
right
of
the
memorandum.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
makes
up
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
makes
up
the
record
in
the
first
circuit?
how
is
it
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
there's
--
if
--
if
--
do
they
have
--
do
they
--
do
their
wishes
control
if
there's
conflict,
goes
before
the
trial
judge,
i
take
it,
to
settle
these.
at
least
that
is
what
we
used
to
do
in
the
second
circuit.
