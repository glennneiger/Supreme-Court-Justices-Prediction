justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
katz,
was
that
a
slip
on
the
rail?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
rail
was
--
was
covered
in
slime?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
might
i
ask
you
in
that
connection.
was
the
rail
designed
for
such
a
use?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
is
no
open
through
the
rail
that
they
may
use?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
they
have
to
get
up
on
the
rail,
engulfed
through
the
rails?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
so
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
would
be
an
intended
use?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
any
doubt
about
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
any
doubt
about
that?
that
the
safe
place
to
work
is
a
negligence
concept?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
thus,
to
exercise
due
character
by
the
safe
place
to
work.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
it
was
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
actually
told
us
in
the
tungus
case
that
it
called
for
a
man
to
come
to
repair
asking
(inaudible)
wasn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
do
we
actually
--
i
have
to
reach
this
question
before.
can
the
action
reach,
if
judge
magruder
is
right,
i
mean,
judge
wyzanski
is
correct,
the
second
--
we
do
a
matter
of
proposition
poses
on
page
52
of
this
record,
namely,
that
the
plaintiff
here
was
injured
by
the
negligence
or
by
the
conduct
whether
or
not
there's
negligence
of
his
agent
then
he
could
recover
only
against
his
agent
for
then
he
has
injured
himself
under
doctrines
of
the
respondeat
superior
and
would
have
no
claim
against
the
owner
of
the
ship.
now,
that's
the
theory
under
which
judge
wyzanski
says,
he
should
have
directed
a
verdict
for
the
shipowner.
point
two,
that
he
is
right
about
that,
then
there
was
nothing
to
submit
to
a
jury.
he
should
have
directed
the
verdict
for
the
shipowner,
was
that
not
followed
if
he's
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
was
he
stating
this?
he
says
that
(inaudible)
whether
the
deposit
was
made
by
a
person
who
regardless
of
his
former
employment
was
at
the
time
of
deposit
the
agent
for
and
only
for
the
plaintiff,
notice
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
don't
understand
then
that
this
memorandum
is
filed
in
explanation
of
his
action
as
his
hearing
by
the
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
still
maintain
that
that
was
so
if,
as
a
matter
of
law,
on
the
record
made
at
the
trial,
the
court
is
right
in
concluding
he
had
erred
in
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury
and
should
have
informed
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
perhaps
not.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
the
motion
for
judgment,
notwithstanding
the
brief,
the
motion
to
be
filed
by
that
in
the
brief?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
this
is
his
opportunity
and
only
opportunity
to
retroact
was
it,
in
the
--
on
his
own
after
the
verdict
of
the
jury.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
even
so.
at
anytime,
the
court
could
point
out,
could
it
not,
i've
made
a
mistake
in
--
for
giving
this
case
to
the
jury,
i
should
have
taken
a
common
jury,
therefore,
if
i
did
make
some
errors
into
my
charge,
they
cannot
hurt
you
because
i
shouldn't
have
let
it
go
to
the
jury
at
all.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
his
--
the
question
of
when
that
his
question
is
right,
if
he
--
if
he
right
in
saying
that
on
this
--
on
this
record,
as
a
matter
of
law,
no
case
has
made
when
you
could
say
at
any
time
(inaudible)
of
the
argument
to
say
it
too
if
it
is
true.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
would
think
so.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
would
think
so.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
i
did
commit
error
in
my
charge
to
the
jury.
in
fact
--
i
am
not
letting
(inaudible)
i
should
not
have
submitted
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
mean
absolute
liability
or
absolute
duty
that
provides
reasonably
a
safe
place?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
what
measures
concept
of
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
lyons
is
a
person?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
does
that
do,
if
i
may
ask,
mr.
whipple,
to
the
concept
of
contract?
do
you
have
any
views
on
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
that
the
duty
is,
of
the
shipowner,
to
exercise
reasonable
care
to
make
and
keep
the
facility
reasonably
safe,
is
that
correct?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then
if
the
duty
is
absolute,
then
would
scienter
be
essential
notice?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
it
was
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine
that
wake
into
life
this
duty.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
seems
to
me
that
takes
us
around
in
a
circle.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
not
saying
you're
wrong.
[laughs]
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
not
saying
that
you
are
wrong.
i
just
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
is
that
correct?
i
understood
that
unseaworthiness
was
an
absolute
duty
to
maintain
a
reasonably
safe
condition
but
not
that
of
an
insurer,
is
that
wrong?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
mr.
whipple,
if
it's
true
that
there
is
no
absolute
duty
to
make
and
keep
it
safe
but
there
is
an
absolute
duty
to
make
it
reasonably
safe,
then
how
could
notice
be
a
factor
if
there's
an
absolute
duty
to
make
and
keep
the
appliances
reasonably
safe,
then
doesn't
that
exclude
scienter?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
no,
but
by
the
use
of
the
word
“absolute
duty”.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
never
been
decided.
