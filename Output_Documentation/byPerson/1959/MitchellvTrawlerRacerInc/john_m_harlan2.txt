justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
dispute
between
you
gentlemen
as
to
whether
this
condition
was
in
--
did
result
as
a
matter
of
law
and
unseaworthiness?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
this
author
of
dixon?
do
you
have
any
case
up
to
now
where
the
indictment
that
you're
contending
for
has
been
applied
in
the
so-called
transitory
unseaworthiness
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
i
made
the
statement
in
that
opinion,
“it
has
never
been
decided.”
well,
that
was
a
number
of
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
was
a
number
of
years
ago,
and
i
was
wondering
what
the
situation
had
been
since.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
judge
hincks'
decision.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wonder
if
you
get
anywhere
with
this
problem
approaching
it
a
little
differently.
do
you
regard
unseaworthiness
is
the
equivalent
of
an
unsafe
place
to
work
concept
and
negligence
and
so
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
it
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
his
problem.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
this
problem
as
you
say.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
i
was
thinking
of
is
this.
is
there
a
difference
in
the
point
of
view
of
seaworthiness
leave
out
the
time
element
for
a
moment
whether
it's
the
inception
of
the
voyage
or
something
that
occurs
after
the
voyage
starts,
is
there
a
difference
in
your
view
between
a
deck
that
has
a
hole
in
it
and
a
deck
that
has
some
fine
line?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
there
is
no
difference?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean
as
--
it
may
be
that
there
isn't
any
difference
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
point
is
you
didn't
have
a
chance
to
litigate
that
issue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
those
both
cases,
mr.
whipple,
where
the
ship
was
at
--
in
her
home
port?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
all
independent,
i
take
it,
whether
the
point
of
time
at
which
the
condition
arose.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
put
a
question
to
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
the
issue
that
you're
putting.
let
me
take
something
that
nobody
dispute
--
dispute
as
an
unseaworthy
condition,
the
last
vessel
and
probably
both
the
(inaudible),
i
take
it
that
if
that
last
fellow
is
a
seaman,
while
the
ship
is
in
their
home
port,
you
would
not
question
the
absolute
liability
problem
of
unseaworthiness,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
if
the
ship
(inaudible)
and
a
good
ship
--
a
good
ship
sailed
on
and
the
ship
sets
out,
ship
goes
out
in
the
ocean,
big
storm
comes
along
and
as
a
result,
the
boat
is
(inaudible)
two
minutes
after
the
wind
stops
blowing
on
somebody
on
a
heading.
i
understood
your
position
would
be
within
the
absence
--
that
no
circumstances,
the
question
would
not
be
one
of
absolute
liability
but
it
is
a
question
of
notice
at
reasonable
time
to
render
the
(inaudible)
the
picture,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
the
--
isn't
that
the
issue
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
all
we
are
talking
about,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
i
was
trying
to
take
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
question
where
the
issue
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
as
to
whether
the
position
of
an
unseaworthiness
condition
couldn't
be
disputed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
was
suggesting
what
the
answer
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
putting
the
issue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
unseaworthiness
(inaudible)
