how
did
this
memorandum
get
in
here
if
it
was
written
in
the
absence
of
(inaudible)
appeal?
why
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
--
how
did
it
get
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
couldn't
we
get
a
memorandum
from
--
in
there
if
he
changed
his
mind
but
you
can
get
it
after
the
appeal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
couldn't
he
file
six
months
after
the
appeal
at
the
court
of
appeals
supposing
the
record
has
any
relevance
to
it?
does
it
have
any
relevance
in
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
a
relevance
in
that
court
based
on
the
record
that's
used.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
second
name?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
see
where
that
would
be
--
those
two
concepts
would
--
would
conflict.
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
since
you
said
that,
an
absolute
duty
to
keep
it
in
reasonably
safe
condition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
negligence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
limit
that
argument
to
transitory
condition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'd
beg
in
saying
it
should
never
--
vessel
should
never
be
considered
unseaworthy,
as
i
understand
it,
if
--
even
though
there's
--
some
place
is
not
reasonably
good
unless
the
company
had
reason
to
know
that
this
transitory
thing
had
brought
this
about.
