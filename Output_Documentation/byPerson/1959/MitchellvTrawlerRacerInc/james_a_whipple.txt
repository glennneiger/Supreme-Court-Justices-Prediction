mr.
james
a.
whipple
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
intended
to
speak
from
an
outline
but
in
view
of
the
questions
of
your
honors,
i
should
like
to
take
up
several
of
those
of
matters
first.
at
first,
there
was
a
question
as
to
the
decisional
analysis
of
the
cases
in
this
court.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
and
to
this
honorable
court
that
all
of
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
may
be
distinguished
on
this
unseaworthiness
case
by
the
fact
that
the
defect
of
the
unseaworthiness
itself
was
a
latent
or
open
or
defect
in
the
equipments
itself.
for
instance,
in
the
mahnich
case,
there
was
a
piece
of
rope
which
was
defective
and
that
it
was
rotted
by
reason
of
having
been
installed
aboard
the
ship
for
sometime,
negligently
picked
up
by
the
mate.
and
i
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
dissented
on
that
case
on
the
ground
that
he
believed
that
was
--
that
negligence
was
the
cause
of
the
injury.
in
the
petterson
case,
even
though
it
is
involved
with
the
question
of
longshoreman
and
control,
the
defect
was
a
defect
in
the
block
itself
which
broke.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
that
is
true.
it's
--
in
that
respect
--
it
is
like
the
(inaudible)
case
in
which
it
had
been
on
there
long
enough
to
become
part
of
the
ship.
the
(inaudible)
case,
i
believe
was
hatch
board
which
the
court
said
was
a
part
of
the
ship.
and
i
do
not
quarrel
with
the
petterson
case
on
that
ground
such
--
there
was
some
other
--
mr.
james
a.
whipple
yes.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
but
it
did
have
a
defect
in
it,
sir.
it
--
mr.
james
a.
whipple
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
it
was
being
used
and
--
mr.
james
a.
whipple
no,
sir.
but
it
had
been
so
attached
to
the
ship
that
it
was
being
used
to
unload
the
cargo.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
well,
i
presume
that
the
longshoreman
company
was
going
to
take
it
back
after
they
were
through
using
it.
that's
suggest,
mr.
justice
stewart,
also
the
problem
of
time
involved
in
these
matters
whether
a
negligent
act
which
may
produce
unseaworthiness
gives
rise
to
an
action
for
both
at
the
same
time
without
a
lapse
of
time.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
well,
that
was
the
issue
in
the
petterson
case.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
yes.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
well,
referring
to
some
further
cases
of
inherent
defect,
as
i
spoke,
the
(inaudible)
case.
the
--
the
ross
and
(inaudible)
case,
i
believe,
had
--
were
--
no,
that
was
--
yes,
that
was
a
case
in
which
eight
hours
had
elapsed.
so
that
--
i
would
contend,
your
honors,
that
this
--
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
present
case
and
those
cases
are
already
decided
in
this
court
in
that
the
temporary
--
temporary
presence,
transient
presence
of
a
slime
on
the
rail
in
this
vessel
cannot
be
compared
with
the
cases
in
which
there
is
an
inherent
defect
in
the
rail
itself.
this
rail
was
perfectly
strong,
it
was
--
it
was
wide
enough
for
a
man's
foot
to
step
on
if
that
was
the
practice
in
custom,
it
was
high
enough
to
prevent
a
man
from
being
washed
over
board
even
with
the
slime
on
it,
i
would
contend
to
your
honors
that
it
is
reasonably
fit
and
adequate
for
its
purpose.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
you
see,
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine
provides
for
absolute
liability
but
also
says
that
the
--
pertinences
may
--
must
be
only
reasonably
fit
for
their
purposes.
now,
reasonably
is
a
word
which
is
important
--
imported
from
the
negligence
side
and
is
what
really
raises
the
confusion
in
this
matter.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
no,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
liability
is
what
i
mean
because
this
court
has
already
held
in
the
west
case
before
referred
to
that
there
is
no
absolute
duty
to
provide
a
safe
place
to
work.
and
there
is
some
confusion,
may
i
suggest
also,
in
whether
this
comes
under
that
doctrine
or
under
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
that
is
true,
your
honor.
and
you
see,
if
we
hold
this
to
be
an
unseaworthy
problem,
it
raises
in,
may
i
suggest,
two
problems
in
addition.
first,
is
at
reasonably
fit,
is
there
an
inherent
defect
in
it?
is
it
by
its
very
nature
not
fit
or
--
and
if
it
is
held
to
be
unseaworthiness,
it
then
raises
the
problem
of
the
safe
place
to
work
doctrine,
the
negligent
side.
may
i
suggest
that
--
that
west
case
has
--
has
some
repercussions
already.
in
the
second
circuit,
i
would
--
it
is
not
in
my
brief
and
i
would
refer
you
to
it,
is
the
case
of
john
lyons
versus
empresa
hondurena
de
vapores
decided
december
18th,
1959.
john
lyons
versus
empresa
--
mr.
james
a.
whipple
lyons,
l-y-o-n-s,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
that's
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
empresa,
e-m-p-r-e-s-s-a,
hondurena,
h-o-n-d-u-r-e-n-a,
de
vapores,
v-a-p-o-r-e-s.december
what?
mr.
james
a.
whipple
december
18th.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
yes,
sir.
in
the
second
circuit.
judge
--
judges
clark,
hincks
and
waterman.
and
judge
clark,
circuit
judge
clark
wrote
the
decision.
now,
in
this
case,
which
i
am
referring
to,
the
lyons
case.
the
ship
had
a
tank
which
had
to
be
cleaned
and
it
was
an
open
tank
and
a
12-inch
board
was
laid
across
the
tank.
and
temporary
lights
were
installed
to
light
the
area.
the
men
injured
across
this
plank,
went
into
an
opening
on
the
other
end
of
it
and
was
working
in
there
and
said
that
when
he
came
out,
the
lights
were
out
causing
him
to
fall
into
the
tank.
there
was
evidence
that
another
man
had
crossed
this
plank
several
--
two
minutes
before
this
occurrence,
the
lights
were
on
and
he
had
returned
two
or
three
minutes
after
the
occurrence
and
the
lights
were
on
so
that
the
lights
were
off
at
the
most
two
or
three
or
four
minutes
here.
now,
the
court
referred
to
the
west
case
in
this
decision
and
it
said
that
it
is
clear
that
the
shipowner's
only
duty
was
that
of
exercising
reasonable
care
under
the
circumstances
citing
west
versus
united
states
in
the
supreme
court
on
december
7th
and
also
citing
the
halecki
case.
indeed,
plaintiff
seems
to
have
recognized
this
principle
when
he
withdrew
a
claim
of
unseaworthiness
at
the
trial.
so
that
if
the
second
circuit
ever
did
hold
that
transitory
conditions
created
unseaworthiness,
it
now
appears
to
be
in
some
doubt,
he's
--
he's
certainly
a
transitory
condition
which
lasted
only
three
or
four
minutes
and
they
didn't
even
consider
it
under
the
unseaworthiness
side.
now,
in
the
second
circuit
also,
on
december
1st,
1959,
another
case
which
i
did
not
cite
in
my
brief,
santa
maria,
this
is
the
steamship
othem,
o-t-h-e-m
decided
december
1st
in
which
the
second
circuit
and
the
same
judges
said
that
the
presence
of
--
so
that
a
deck
made
slippery
by
rain
water
does
not
constitute
an
unseaworthy
condition.
now
--
mr.
james
a.
whipple
december
1st,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
let
me
see,
the
--
yes.
the
--
this
last
one
i
cited,
the
santa
maria
case
was
decided
it
was
a
longshoremen
while
unloading
the
vessel
and
the
other
case
--
yes,
because
it
was
bethlehem
steel
employee
injured
while
work
and
the
power
in
that
case
came
from
bethlehem
steel,
their
installation
on
shore
i
presume.
well,
if
we
hold
that
a
transitory
condition
equates
unseaworthiness,
then
we
meet
this
problem
--
further
problem
of
--
when
does
the
--
what
kind
of
a
condition,
what
kind
of
a
transitory
condition.
rainwater
on
a
deck
is
not
making
the
deck
slippery,
doesn't
make
the
deck
not
fit
for
its
purposes
according
to
the
second
circuit.grain
dust
on
deck
as
in
the
pope
--
hawn
versus
pope
&
talbot
oil
on
an
oil
tanker,
coal
dust
on
the
carrier,
slime
on
a
fishing
vessel,
these
problems
then
arise
if
we
hold
this
to
be
unseaworthy.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
well,
mr.
justice
harlan.
may
i
say
that
i
would
grant
that
unseaworthiness
could
exist
if
time
has
elapsed
and
if
it's
noticed.
if
it
becomes
such
a
part
of
the
vessel
by
the
time
elapsed
and
noticed
that
it
is
then
a
part
of
the
vessel
and
not
just
a
transitory,
of
course,
then,
it's
no
longer
a
transitory
substance.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
well,
this
may
be
a
concept
of
--
of
contract,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
but
when
the
court
says
that
it
must
be
reasonably
fit,
it
is
bringing
in
also
concepts
of
negligence.
contract
action,
i
--
i
submit,
maybe
for
carelessly
performing
a
contract
so
that
there
is
that
element
in
it.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
is
the
question
what,
sir?
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
i
have
been
addressing
myself
to
the
problem.
first,
that
it
is
not
there
is
not
unseaworthiness,
secondly,
if
it
is
in
this
sort
of
unseaworthiness
case
notice
or
and
opportunity
to
correct
definition
should
be
made
a
requisite,
perhaps
we
can
get
around
the
difficulty
by
saying
that
it
doesn't
become
unseaworthiness
until
there
is
time
and
notice.
there
are
certain
other
aspects
of
the
absolute
duty
to
provide
a
seaworthy
ship.
for
instance,
the
--
the
latest,
newest
most
reasonable
--
as
the
newest
and
latest
and
most
modern
appurtenances
don't
have
to
be
supplied
but
only
reasonably
fit.
it's
like
the
question
of
the
--
of
the
snowflake.
the
owner
doesn't
have
a
duty
to
catch
the
first
--
every
snowflake
but
accumulation
and
time
affect
his
duty,
and
these
suggest
notice.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
no,
sir.
no,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i
do
not
quarrel
with
the
concept
of
absolute
duty
to
provide
a
seaworthy
ship.
i
do
say
that
a
seaworthy
ship
involves
only
reasonably
necessary
appurtenances
to
take
one
and
so
forth.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
not
if
it
constitutes
unseaworthiness.
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court,
they
have
already
decided
that
the
duty
is
absolute
which
means
knowledge
and
notice
isn't
necessary
on
unseaworthiness.
i
do
not
attempt
to
change
the
court's
decision
on
that
respect.
i
do
say
that
when
we
have
a
further
problem
of
what
is
unseaworthiness
and
that
in
certain
respects
unseaworthiness
does
not
occur
unless
there
is
knowledge
and
opportunity.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
true,
that
if
unseaworthiness
is
granted,
then
we
have
the
duty.
but
before
we
find
unseaworthiness,
we
must
inquire
into
this
preliminary
question.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
[laughs]
i
can
only
say
that
the
cases
suggest
that
the
--
that
we
do
go
around
in
a
circle.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
sir?
mr.
james
a.
whipple
going
back
to
several
other
questions
for
the
moment.
on
the
fact
of
this
case,
this
seaman
did
not
have
any
expressed
agreement
with
the
owner
as
to
keeping
this
for
in
for
their
own
account.
they
were,
by
custom,
allowed
to
do
so,
and
i
suppose
you
could
call
it
an
--
an
implied
agreement.
they
didn't
have
to
do
it
if
they
didn't
want
to
if
they
wanted
to
make
the
extra
money
by
doing
it,
they
could
do
so
and
the
owner
would
not
impede
them.
the
only
requirement,
i
believe
it
shows
on
the
evidence
in
the
record,
was
that
they
so
stole
the
spawn
that
it
could
be
unloaded
first
so
as
not
to
impede
the
unloading
of
the
catch
of
the
vessel.
the
--
the
record
further
shows
in
the
evidence
that
the
mate
nor
the
captain
assigned
any
jobs
nor
have
the
authority
even
the
same
--
assign
the
jobs
to
these
12
crew
members
amongst
themselves
in
unloading
the
spawn.
one
of
them
voluntarily
went
on
deck,
one
voluntarily
went
on
the
hull,
one
went
up
(inaudible)
to
catch
the
baskets
as
they
were
swung
ashore.
and
they
did
that
amongst
themselves
and
decided
amongst
themselves
and
indeed
denied
the
authority
of
the
captain
to
--
to
assign
the
specific
task
necessary.
and
furthermore,
they
sole
respond
themselves.
the
money
and
the
accounting
did
not
go
through
the
owner's
books
at
all
but
was
sold
on
the
fish
exchange
by
one
of
the
crew
members
for
the
12
members.
that
was
the
basis
really
for
judge
wyzanski's
memorandum,
i
think.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
yes,
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
that's
the
only
thing
i
could
say.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
rely
upon
that
on
the
court.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
which
should
you
be
governed
by?
mr.
james
a.
whipple
the
charge
i
should
say,
your
honor.
it's
up
here
on
that
issue
and
that
issue
alone.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
and
i
think
that's
the
issue
that
really
requires
your
decision.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
i
--
mr.
james
a.
whipple
well
--
mr.
james
a.
whipple
i
was
relying
upon
it,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
up
to
the
point
were
he
ruled
that
he
was
a
seaman.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
but
further
beyond
that,
i
did
not.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
no.
i
have
not
relied
on
it.
i
do
not
now
rely
upon
it.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
well,
i
did
in
the
court
of
appeals,
intend
to,
and
i
--
i
didn't
know
whether
i
wanted
to.
i
had
to
print
all
the
record
i've
--
in
advance
so
that
i
--
mr.
james
a.
whipple
well,
if
that
was
--
mr.
james
a.
whipple
yes.
that
--
that
was
an
over
cite,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
we
merely
took
the
record
out
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
put
it
up
here
and
i've
--
by
over
cite
left
that
in.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
the
--
the
appealing
party
designates
the
portions
of
the
record
that
he
once
printed
and
the
respondent
may
file
a
counter
designation
filing
such
other
parts
as
he
may
wish
that
were
left
out.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
i've
always
considered
that
i
had
the
right
to
print
the
whole
record
if
i
wish
to.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
yes.
justice
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
in
view
of
the
many
expressions
of
this
court
that
it
is
an
absolute
duty,
i
could
not
contest
that.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
i
would
say
that
that
would
not
be
unseaworthiness
--
mr.
james
a.
whipple
yes,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
yes.
in
--
one
more
point,
mr.
justice
harlan.
you
ask
if
a
hull
in
the
deck
were
of
the
same
caliber
or
slime
on
the
deck,
i
would
say
no
in
answer
to
that.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
yes.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
yes.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
it's
the
only
position
i
can
logically
take,
your
honor.
and
i
think,
it's
the
only
position
that
should
be
logically
followed
too,
unless
we
say
that
--
mr.
james
a.
whipple
surely.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
may
i
suggest
that
it
--
it
is
the
logical
answer
because
--
unless
we
do
hold
flatly
that
the
vessel
owner
is
an
insurer.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
that's
right.
he
--
he
has
an
absolute
duty
to
maintain
a
reasonably
safe
vessel
but
he
does
not
insure
that
the
co-members
will
be
not
be
negligent
or
he
does
not
insure
that
accidents
will
not
happen
as
your
--
as
this
court
has
held.
he
does
not
insure
things
of
that
nature.
judge
magruder
in
his
decision
put
the
case
of
a
perfectly
seaworthy
--
perfectly
seaworthy
rail
of
washed,
loose
broken
by
a
tremendous
sea
and
a
concurrent
loss
of
a
seaman
through
the
opening
so
provided.
and
i
say
that
that
vessel
was
--
it
was
--
by
the
nature
of
the
point
that
the
vessel
was
seaworthy,
and
i
think
she
should
be
still
held
to
be
seaworthy
until
there
was
notice
or
an
opportunity
in
that
case.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
not
by
the
use
of
the
word
“reasonable”.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
here
we
are
in
a
circle
may
it
please
the
court.
you've
got
these
two
conflicts
in
this
--
the
previous
sayings
of
this
court,
the
previous
rules.
reasonable
as
opposed
to
absolute
and
the
conflict
must
be
resolved
somewhere.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
well,
this
court
has
held
in
the
west
case
that
the
duty
to
supply
a
safe
place
to
work
is
not
the
equivalent
of
seaworthiness
and
says
that
the
duty
to
provide
a
safe
place
to
work
belongs
on
the
negligence
side
of
this
question.
that's
what
the
west
case
in
my
opinion
really
holds.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
yes.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
that's
negligence
mr.
james
a.
whipple
sir?
mr.
james
a.
whipple
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
you
said
in
that
case
that
you
--
so
far
you
had
found
only
one
reason
for
absolute
liability
and
that
was
unseaworthiness.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
summing
it
up,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
faced
here
with
the
past
decisions
of
this
court
in
which
it
seems
to
be
indicated
that
the
absolute
duty
applies
to
reasonably
fit
appurtenances,
reasonably
fit
for
the
purpose.
this
by
decisional
analysis
apply
first
to
inherent
defects,
improperly
constructed
appurtenances,
appurtenances
originally
proper
but
by
--
but
have
become
improper
such
as
the
rotten
rope
in
the
mahnich
case.
secondly,
reasonably
fit
doesn't
mean
that
it
has
to
be
the
newest,
best,
most
modern
appliance
or
rail
as
in
this
case.
thirdly,
if
we
hold
the
--
the
presence
of
a
transitory
substance
on
the
deck,
we
run
into
the
problem
of
confusing
it,
that
problem
with
the
safe
place
to
work
doctrine
which
you
have
held
belongs
on
the
negligence
side
of
the
court.
it
runs
into
the
problem
of
drawing
a
line
between
natural
accumulations
of
rain
water,
as
i
stated,
coal
dust
in
the
carrier,
oil
on
an
oil
ship,
where
is
the
line
to
be
drawn
between
those
substances
and
--
and
the
substances
and
fish
slime
on
a
fish
vessel
and
other
substances
such
as
apple
peels
in
the
poignant
case
and
the
further
problem
of
holding
a
transitory
substance
on
a
deck
to
be
unseaworthy,
the
--
the
further
problem
of
whether
that
applies
under
the
absolute
duty
to
provide
seaworthiness.
the
respondent
respectfully
submits
that
it
does
not
in
that
case.
now
--
mr.
james
a.
whipple
yes,
sir.
i
must
--
i
want
to
confine
it
as
closely
to
the
facts
in
this
case
if
possible.
mr.
james
a.
whipple
that's
right.
i
can
conceive
of
circumstances
under
which
a
transitory
--
the
presence
of
a
transitory
substance
might
create
unseaworthiness,
for
instance,
an
oil
soaked
rope
so
that
the
fibers
of
that
rope
do
not
have
the
characteristics
of
proper
fit
reasonable
rope.
it
is
so
soaked
in
and
--
and
changed
the
nature,
the
inherent
nature
of
that
rope
that
it
is
no
longer
reasonably
fit.
here
where
we
have
an
apple
peel
for
some
moment
of
time
or
banana
skin
or
--
or
a
slime
on
a
rail
or
--
i
believe,
someone
asked
the
time
on
that,
i
think,
it
was
five
to
11
minutes
in
the
testimony
that
it
had
been
there
at
the
maximum.
now,
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
it
was
stated
that
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
courts
below
saying
--
the
statement
that
the
first
and
third
endorsed
the
transitory
unseaworthiness
although
i
prefer
to
call
it
a
transitory
condition
case
and
the
second
and
ninth
being
against
it
but
as
i
--
in
these
cases
i
have
cited
to
you,
i
think
there
are
some
question
as
to
whether
the
second
would
not
hold
a
transitory
condition
not
to
be
related
to
unseaworthiness.
and
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
only
case
i
know
of
is
that
pacific
far
east
lines
versus
williams.
and
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
even
assuming
that
cookingham
case
to
be
the
law
in
this
jurisdiction
which
is
dubious,
i
think
they
used
that
word,
they
decided
the
williams
case
on
the
ground
not
that
it
was
a
transitory
condition
but
that
there
was
an
actual
defect
in
the
ship
and
that
the
lights
were
not
proper.
so
that
it
is
not
as
clear,
i
believe,
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
there
is
a
conflict
as
it
would
at
first
blush
appear.
