mr.
morris
d.
katz
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
of
this
honorable
court.
this
is
a
seaman's
case
and
it
comes
here
on
a
certiorari
from
the
first
circuit.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
this,
substantially.
mr.
mitchell,
the
petitioner,
as
a
seaman
and
a
fisherman
and
a
member
of
the
crew
of
a
fishing
vessel,
racer,
which
is
a
fishing
trawler
out
of
boston.
in
april
1957,
he
was
a
member
of
her
crew
and
at
that
time,
she
came
back
to
boston
after
having
made
a
10-day
fishing
trip
to
the
fishing
grounds.
in
accordance
with
the
usual
practice,
the
catch
was
then
to
be
unloaded.
during
the
spawning
season,
there
is
both
spawn
and
fish
to
be
unloaded
and
in
accordance
with
the
custom,
the
spawn
is
unloaded
first.
on
that
day,
the
spawn
was
unloaded
by
the
deckhands
and
in
the
unloading
of
the
spawn,
mr.
mitchell,
the
petitioner,
worked
in
the
hold
of
the
vessel.
when
the
spawn
was
unloaded
and
in
accordance
with
custom,
the
dock
and
the
deck
and
the
rail
are
customarily
washed
down
and
those
of
the
crew
who
wish
to
go
home,
then
do
so
and
the
balance
of
the
catch
is
taken
out
by
those
of
the
crew
who
wish
to
work
and
other
persons
who
are
hired
to
do
the
job,
people
known
as
“lumpers”.
on
that
particular
day
when
mr.
mitchell,
the
petitioner,
finished
his
work
in
the
hold,
he
came
up
on
deck
and
then
proceeded
to
the
(inaudible)
where
he
change
his
clothes,
his
working
clothes,
changing
into
his
shore
clothes,
came
back
up
on
deck,
intending
to
go
ashore.
and
in
further
accordance
with
custom,
he
stepped
up
from
the
deck
onto
to
the
rail
of
the
vessel
which
was
alongside
the
wharf,
intending
from
there
to
grasp
a
ladder
which
is
attached
to
the
side
of
the
wharf
and
in
that
manner,
to
make
his
way
ashore.
when
the
petitioner
stepped
onto
the
rail
of
this
vessel
and
was
reaching
for
the
ladder,
he
slipped
in
some,
what
he
described
as
slime
and
gurry.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
he
slipped
when
he
stood
on
the
rail
as
he
was
reaching
for
the
ladder.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
the
evidence
will
show
10
to
12
feet
of
it,
i
believe.
as
he
reached
for
the
ladder
and
was
standing
on
the
rail,
he
slipped.
and
to
keep
himself
from
falling
between
the
vessel
and
the
dock
into
the
water,
he
thrust
his
arm
through
a
rung
of
the
ladder
and
he
hanged
there
for
a
brief
period
until
he
was
able
to
work
his
back
--
way
back
to
safety
aboard
the
vessel.
when
he
hanged
there
by
his
arm,
he
suffered
serious
permanent
injury
to
his
arm.
this
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
of
massachusetts
and
there
were
three
counts.
the
first
count
was
for
negligence
under
the
jones
act,
the
second
count
for
unseaworthiness
and
the
third,
for
maintenance
and
cure.
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
for
the
defendant
on
the
first
two
counts
and
for
the
plaintiff
on
the
third
count
and
it
was
in
charging
the
jury,
that
the
judge
stated
what
the
petitioner
considers
to
have
been
the
error
in
the
case.
he
stated
that
notice
was
not
--
notice
was
--
he
stated
that
notice
was
necessary
with
respect
to
both
the
unseaworthiness
and
the
negligence
counts.
he
stated
that
the
--
he
made
no
distinction
between
the
charge
with
respect
to
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
and
charge
that
in
order
to
recover
on
either
count,
the
petitioner
had
to
show
that
the
slime
was
on
the
rail
for
a
period
of
time
long
enough
for
the
respondent
to
have
known
about
it
and
to
have
the
opportunity
to
remove
it.
counsel
for
the
petitioner
made
an
oral
request
that
the
court
distinguish
in
his
charge
between
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
and
in
particular
requested
the
court
to
instruct
the
jury
that
insofar
as
the
unseaworthiness
count
was
concerned,
notice
was
not
a
necessary
element.
the
trial
judge
denied
the
request.
the
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
who
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
the
case
has
been
petitioned,
it's
up
here
in
petition
for
certiorari,
certiorari
having
been
granted.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
gurry
as
closely
as
i
can
describe
is
this
jellyish,
gelatinous
substance
that
will
drift
from
a
wet
fish.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
spawn
is
the
--
is
the
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
fish
eggs,
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
yes,
sir.
during
certain
seasons
of
the
year,
i
think
the
first
three
months
of
the
year,
they
get
spawn
and
that
becomes
the
part
of
the
catch.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
this
is
what
they
call
“groundfish”,
your
honor.
groundfish
being
fish
swim
near
the
bottom
of
the
ocean,
generally
speaking,
had
it
and
caught.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
they
get
in
from
the
insides
of
a
fish
that
they
catch,
your
honor.
during
the
spawning
season,
they
will
be
spawn
inside
the
fish
and
when
they
--
part
in
delicacy
got
the
fish
on
the
deck
of
the
vessel.
they
take
out
the
spawn.
spawn
is
set
aside,
set
into
what
i
believe
is
cotton
bags
and
put
into
the
hull.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
notice
is
required
in
unseaworthiness
claim.
where
the
unseaworthiness
comes
from
what
it
is
described
and
can
be
described
as
a
temporary
or
transitory
substance.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
probably
there
is,
your
honor.
since
whether
or
not,
there
is
unseaworthiness
would
be
a
question
of
fact.
in
other
words,
whether
or
not
the
condition
there
created
a
situation
where
the
rail,
which
was
customarily
used
for
stepping
on
and
going
ashore,
was
not
reasonably
suited
for
that
purpose
at
that
time.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
by
accepted
practice,
your
honor.
the
rail
of
the
vessel
is
used
for
that
purpose.
in
other
words,
they
have
--
these
vessels
pull
into
a
--
a
dock
and
there
are
ladders
attached
to
the
side
of
the
dock
and
in
order
to
get
onto
the
ladders,
the
men
have
to
step
onto
the
rail
to
get
to
the
ladder.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
no,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
no,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
the
only
other
possibility
for
getting
ashore,
as
i
visualized
it,
is
for
a
man
to
climb
up
onto
what
is
known
as
the
“whale
back”
which
is
the
bow
of
the
vessel
and
since
the
whale
back
is
raised
up
about
possibly
six
or
eight
feet
above
the
main
deck,
he
might
then
be
able
to
step
directly
from
the
whale
back
onto
the
wharf
but
the
testimony
in
the
case
and
the
record
will
show
that
it
was
perfectly
accepted
practice
for
the
men
to
step
from
the
deck
onto
the
rail
with
an
intermediate
step,
and
i
don't
want
to
confuse
the
court,
from
the
deck
onto
what
is
known
as
a
“checker”.
a
checker
merely
--
meaning
a
heavy
timber
which
is
about,
i
there
say,
10
feet
long,
three
feet
wide
and
about
four
or
five
inches
thick.
and
these
checkers
are
used
to
check
sections
of
the
deck
off
into
squares.
they
are
set
up
into
stanchions.
if
this
is
the
main
deck,
there
would
be
stanchions
at
various
spots
on
the
deck
and
these
checkers
would
be
set
into
the
stanchions,
some
running
four
and
a
half
and
some
running
at
fourth
shifts.
so
that
the
effect
would
be
that
you
would
have
sections
of
the
deck.
the
purpose
for
that
being
that
when
they
dump
the
fish
on
the
deck
if
there
were
no
checkers,
the
fish
will
wash
from
one
side
to
the
other
with
no
hindrance
whereas
with
these
checkers
and
they
set
up
sections
on
the
deck,
probably
five
--
five
or
six
feet
square.
a
checker
would
be
about
the
area
of
this
part
of
the
deck
from
this
end
to
where
my
hand
is.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
the
answer
to
that,
sir,
is
yes.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
why
the
ladder
was
where
it
was?
you
mean
the
ladder
that
he
was
reaching
for?
the
ladder
is
affixed
to
the
outside
of
the
wharf
at
intervals
of
about,
i
there
say,
100
feet
and
those
are
not
movable
ladders,
those
are
permanently
fixed
so
that
when
the
vessel
comes
in
and
its
tied
up
to
the
side
of
the
wharf
if
the
tide
is
low
enough,
he
must
get
on
to
the
ladder
to
go
ashore.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
i
think
not,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
i
think
the
only
problem
is
whether
or
not
notice
--
whether
or
not
that
plaintiff
in
the
trial
of
that
case
was
entitled
to
a
charge
which
did
not
include
the
requirement
of
notice
insofar
as
the
unseaworthiness
count
is
concerned.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
if
this
court
so
finds,
then
we
go
back
for
retrial.
the
question
then
would
be,
did
this
in
fact
constitute
an
unseaworthy
condition
with
the
usual
test
of
what
is
unseaworthy.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
may
i
say
this,
sir,
with
respect
to
that.
this
case
was
tried
and
in
the
cause
of
the
trial
on
two
occasions,
during
the
course
of
the
trial
and
in
his
charge,
judge
wyzanski
charged
that
he
rule
--
stated
and
charged
that
he
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
petitioner,
mitchell,
was
engaged
in
the
course
of
his
employment
at
the
time
he
was
injured.
he
was
a
seaman
and
engaged
into
his
employment
and
that
the
injuries
arose
out
of
the
employment.
i
would
like
to
say
also
this,
sir.
judge
wyzanski,
as
i'm
sure
you
know,
is
a
judge
of
whom
we,
of
the
massachusetts
bar,
are
very
proud.
nevertheless,
i
respectfully
submit
that
he
committed
error,
not
only
in
his
charge
but
following
the
trial
of
the
case
and
two
weeks
after
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
he
filed
a
memorandum
which
is
part
of
this
record.
and
in
that
memorandum,
he
states
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
yes,
your
honor.
he
states
in
the
memorandum
two
things.
he
says
they
should
have
been
a
directive
verdict
on
the
unseaworthiness
charge.
but
following
the
trial
of
the
case,
he
denied
the
defendants
request
for
directive
verdict.
he
also
suggest
here
that
they
may
have
been
a
“joint
venture”
as
a
result
of
which
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
but,
your
honor,
he
specifically
ruled
otherwise
at
the
course
of
the
trial.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
and
i
say
this
with
all
respect
and
with
admiration
for
judge
wyzanski
and
whose
court,
both
mr.
whipple
and
i
tried
--
been
privileged
to
try
many
cases.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
the
basis
for
that
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
it's
not
one
of
the
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
--
question
presented.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
well,
probably
we
have
to
argue
it
again
in
the
district
court
if
we
--
if
i
am
fortunate
to
go
back
there
with
this
case.
may
i
make
this
brief
statement
with
respect
to
why
he
undoubtedly
felt
that
way,
two
weeks
after
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed.
it
doesn't
occur
anywhere
in
the
record
of
the
trial
of
the
case
up
to
the
time
the
jury
came
back
with
its
verdict.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
the
basis
for
him
suggesting
the
joint
venture.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
when
these
fishermen
go
out
normally,
what
they
get
is
a
fish
and
they
bring
it
back
and
they
share
in
the
proceeds.
during
the
time
of
the
year
where
there
is
spawn,
by
agreement
with
the
owners
as
part
of
the
proceeds
of
the
catch,
the
12
deckhands,
by
the
way
there
are
17
men
on
this
boat,
there
are
12
deckhands,
the
captain,
the
mate,
two
engineers
and
a
cook,
during
the
spawning
season,
by
agreement
with
the
owner
with
the
employer,
the
12
deckhands
get
the
proceeds
of
the
spawn
in
addition
to
their
regular
shares
of
the
catch.
the
other
members
of
the
crew
they
get
--
the
captain
gets
what
is
known
as
a
“per”
or
10%
of
the
owner's
share
of
the
catch
in
addition
to
his
share
of
the
catch.
the
cook
gets
also
a
per,
something
per
trip,
i
think
its
$20
per
trip.
the
engineers
each
get
a
per
and
the
mate
also
gets
a
per.
now,
under
--
judge
wyzanski
felt
that
since
the
substance
on
which
this
man
probably
fell
was
drippings
from
the
spawn
that
had
been
unloaded
and
since
the
proceeds
of
the
spawn
went
only
to
the
12
deckhands,
there
might
have
been
the
basis
for
saying
this
was
a
joint
venture
but
that,
i
respectfully
submit,
sir,
is
a
question
of
fact
which
could
stand
further
evidence
if
we
had
the
opportunity
to
go
back
and
try
this
case
again
because
the
plaintiff
relied
upon
the
facts
that
the
judge
ruled
that
the
course
--
during
the
trial
and
in
his
charge
to
the
jury,
that
this
man
was
injured,
that
he
was
an
employee
of
the
defendant,
he
was
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
contrary
to
the
joint
venture
theory.
i
--
i
submit
that
that
--
i
have
not
said
--
i
think
i
have
made
a
reference
to
it
in
my
brief
but
have
not
argued
it
specifically
except
to
point
out
the
inconsistencies
of
this
learned
judge.
i
will
not
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
i'm
not
familiar
with
them,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
well,
the
only
experience
i
have
had,
in
a
case
where
a
fishing
venture
is
--
has
been
called
a
joint-venturer
and
this
was
not
my
case,
but
i
read
of
it,
is
aware
there
was
a
so-called
family
boat
where
the
entire
crew
is
made
up
of
members
of
one
family
and
when
they
went
out
fishing,
they
sat
down,
they
decided,
“we'll
go
today,”
and
if
they
want
to
come
back,
they
said,
“we'd
go
--
we'll
come
back
today.”
and
where
the
fish,
how
to
fish,
when
the
fish
always
decided
in
concert,
that
isn't
what
happens.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
i
don't
know
of
any.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
thank
you,
sir.
the
petitioner
says
there
were
two
fundamental
reasons
why
notices
not
required
in
these
cases.
the
first
reason
can
be
called
one
based
upon
logic
and
reason.
a
seaman
and
a
seaman's
law
is
a
peculiar
one,
without
going
too
deeply
into
it
because
i
think
these
facts
are
well-known
to
this
court
because
of
the
many
cases
on
this
subject
that
had
been
here.
the
seaman
comes
under
working
conditions
of
which
he
has
no
control.
he
is
under
an
absolute
duty
to
obey
at
all
times.
he
owes
a
duty
of
obedience
and
loyalty
and
service
to
his
vessel
and
to
his
employer
which
he
cannot
deny.
for
that
reason
and
speaking
logically
still,
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
shipowner
has
a
corresponding
absolute
duty
to
provide
at
all
times
for
this
man
engaged
in
this
hazardous
occupation,
a
seaworthy
vessel,
and
that
applies
not
only
to
seaworthy
vessel
with
respect
to
conditions
that
are
permanent
such
as
the
basic
structure
of
the
ship
but
also
such
things
as
maybe
called
transitory
or
temporary.
since
the
seaman
must
serve,
it
is
submitted
that
the
shipowner
must
provide
and
maintain
this
vessel.
now,
with
respect
to
--
apart
from
logic
and
reason,
we
have
many
cases
on
this
subject.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
he
must
serve,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
he
has
no
alternative.
if
he
is
a
seaman,
he
must
serve.
if
he
is
in
the
service
of
a
vessel
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
--
unless
incapacitated
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
it
is
their
freedom
of
choice
before
joining
the
vessel.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
[laughter]
mr.
morris
d.
katz
the
prior
supporting
decisions
are
another
basis
for
holding
that
notice
is
not
required
in
these
cases.
the
general
proposition
is
that
a
seaman
--
a
shipowner
has
an
absolute
and
non-delegable
duty
to
provide
and
maintain
a
seaworthy
vessel,
and
that
duty
is
not
based
upon
concepts
of
negligence.
and
these
cases
run
through
the
osceola,
the
sandanger
case,
mahnich
case,
sieracki
case,
the
petterson
case,
boudoin,
ferguson
as
well
as
others.
for
example,
in
the
petterson
case
this
quote
comes,
“there
is
an
absolute
duty
to
provide
a
seaworthy
vessel,
the
sieracki
liability
without
fault.”
mr.
morris
d.
katz
i
don't
understand
your
question,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
the
facts
are
different,
your
honor.
the
facts
are
such,
for
example,
in
these
cases
that
i
have
mentioned,
any
one
of
this
stevedore
cases,
seiracki,
petterson.
judge
magruder
says,
“due
diligence
is
enough
once
the
voyage
has
commenced.”
but
that
is
not
so.
all
of
these
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
well,
you
are
now
covering
a
group
of
cases,
and
i
would
have
to
examine
each
one.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
but
i
think
he
unfairly
dealt
with
them
in
his
conclusion.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
two
things
he
says
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
two
things
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
there
are
two
things
that
he
says.
fundamentally
he
says,
“we
begin
with
the
osceola.”
now,
we
say
beginning
with
the
osceola,
absolute
liability,
absolute
duty
to
provide
a
seaworthy
vessel.
he
says
that
is
faulty.
it's
a
faulty
premise.
and
that
is
recognized,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
in
the
--
in
the
osceola
case,
the
dictum
did
not
go
to
the
actual
facts
of
the
case
itself.
but
may
i
suggest,
sir,
that
--
in
my
brief,
i
quote
mr.
justice
stewart
in
his
recent
decision
in
the
halecki
case
who
in
turn
is
quoting
gilmore
and
black,
and
i
read
this
quotation,
“the
eventual
development
of
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
in
this
court
is
familiar
history,
although
of
dubious
ancestry,”
and
i
think
he
there
refers
to
the
osceola
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
that
is
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
that
is
true,
sir.
but
he
says
there,
the
doctrine
was
born
with
the
osceola
although
of
dubious
ancestry
and
immerged
full-blown
in
mahnich
against
the
southern
steamship
co.
as
an
absolute
and
non-delegable
duty.
now,
while
it
began
with
dubious
ancestry,
may
i
say
with
respect
to
that,
there
is
a
vast
body
of
law.
now,
based
upon
that
so-called
dubious
ancestry
even
though
it
started
as
dictum
in
the
case
and
the
facts
of
the
case
were
not
--
the
dictum
was
not
directly
in
point
with
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
no,
i
think,
you're
referring
to
the
mahnich
case.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
where
the
rope
broke
and
there
was
another
rope,
a
good
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
--
rope,
and
they
picked
up
a
faulty
rope
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
--
and
that
was
mahnich.
may
--
may
i
say
this
with
respect
to
that
osceola
and
its
dubious
ancestry,
i
think
that
illegitimate
ancestry
if
such
it'd
be
is
not
as
important
as
contemporary,
propriety
and
integrity
and
reasonable
basis
for
this
doctrine
whatever
its
origin.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
the
reason
and
policy,
your
honor,
i
would
say
is
--
arises
out
of
the
relationship
between
the
parties,
between
the
shipowner
and
the
seaman,
the
seaman
who
must
--
who
must
subject
himself
to
the
working
conditions
provided
by
the
shipowner.
he
has
no
way
of
changing
them
except
that
as
you
suggest
did
not
going
aboard
but
i
submit
that
he
has
no
way
of
knowing
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
--
what
the
conditions
are
aboard
until
he
gets
aboard.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
no.
they
did
not,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
yes
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
yes,
there
is.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
many
instances
where
liability
without
fault
exists.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
that
is
the
problem,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
that
is
the
problem,
sir.
and
may
i
say,
if
i
may,
parenthetically,
although
the
dixon
case
did
not
face
up
to
that
question
and
decide
whether
there
was
liability
for
unseaworthiness
arising
after
the
commence
of
the
voyage,
the
two
subsequent
cases
in
the
second
circuit
did.
the
poignant
case
specifically
held
that
due
diligence
was
not
enough,
that
unseaworthiness
arising
after
the
voyage
began
was
also
a
basis
for
liability
and
that
was
--
there
was
another
case,
hildebrandt
against
the
united
states
which
also
said
the
same
thing,
following
the
poignant
case
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
the
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
it
has
not.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
it
has
not
been
specifically
decided
on
this
level.
the
doctrine
arose,
the
so-called
transitory
unseaworthiness
doctrine
arose
with
the
cookingham
case
in
the
third
circuit.
there
was
a
strong
dissent
by
the
chief
judge
of
that
court.
subsequent
to
that,
there
was
the
poignant
case
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
with
a
concurring
opinion
by
judge
frank.
and
those
two
cases
stand
diametrically
opposed,
the
cookingham
case
and
the
poignant
case.
in
the
cookingham
case,
what
apparently
the
court
here
was
that,
i
read
this
from
the
cookingham
case,
“in
the
present
case,
the
stairway
upon
which
the
libellant
slipped
was
perfectly
sound.
it's
unsafe
condition
being
the
sole
result
of
the
temporary
presence
of
a
foreign
substance
upon
it.
to
extend
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
to
cover
such
a
case
as
this
would
be
to
make
the
shipowner
an
insurer.”
now,
that
is
the
fear
in
the
cookingham
case.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
doesn't
happen.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
i
think
not,
sir,
respectfully.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
there
is
an
absolute
duty
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
to
provide
a
seaworthy
vessel.
but
the
question
then
is
what
is
a
seaworthy
vessel.
now,
with
this
--
i
think
in
the
--
i
think
in
the
cookingham
case,
there
was
jello
on
the
stairway.
with
a
proper
charge
from
a
jury
--
to
a
jury,
there
would
be
presented
to
the
jury
the
law
based
upon
the
absolute
duty
to
provide
a
seaworthy
vessel
but
then,
the
question
is
presented
to
the
jury
and
it
is
a
question
of
fact.
did
in
fact
this
substance,
whatever
it
may
have
been,
whether
it'd
be
slime
on
the
rail
of
a
fishing
vessel
or
--
or
a
jello
on
the
stairway
of
a
merchant
ship,
did
this
substance
in
fact
create
an
unseaworthy
condition?
now,
that
is
the
shipowner's
protection.
he
is
not
an
insurer.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
no,
sir.
it's
not
a
question
of
causation.
it's
a
question
of
fact
as
was
stated
in
the
poignant
case.
and
the
poignant
case
holds
directly
for
the
--
for
the
position
that
i
am
contending
for,
as
stated
in
the
poignant
case,
not
--
not
every
deposit
of
a
foreign
substance
makes
the
vessel
unseaworthy.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
your
honor,
he
easily
could.
and
if
i
don't
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
i
think
the
rule
of
law
contended
for
here
is
very
important.
and
i
think
what
happens
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
and
i
think
that
what
happens
in
the
court
if
we
are
fortunate
to
go
back
there
is
subject
to
the
direction
of
judge
wyzanski
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
it
is
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
that's
true,
sir.
that's
the
specific
answer.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
no.
they
--
they
couldn't
find
that
it
was
not
to
walk
on
but
they
could
--
they
could
find
based
upon
this
discussion
i
just
had
with
mr.
associate
justice
frankfurter,
they
could
find
either
that
this
foreign
substance
on
the
rail
did
in
fact
constitute
an
unseaworthy,
unfit,
inadequate
condition
on
that
rail
or
it
did
not.
that
would
be
the
question
of
facts
submitted
to
them
in
the
charge.
but
notice,
which
is
the
issue
in
the
case
as
presented
to
this
court
today,
would
be
foreign.
it
would
be
a
foreign
element
in
any
case
relying
upon
unseaworthiness.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
very
helpful,
sir.
it
specifically
says,
“notice
was
not
an
element
in
an
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
--
in
an
unseaworthy
case.”
mr.
morris
d.
katz
i
was
getting
to
that
in
my
argument.
many
of
these
are
transitory
things.
for
instance
in
the
petterson
case,
you
got
to
block
ride
aboard
by
stevedores
and
a
stevedore
is
injured.
and
in
the
decision
on
that
case,
it
was
held
and
the
per
curiam
decision
affirmed
it
that
negligence
has
no
part
of
a
case
based
upon
unseaworthiness
and
lack
of
control
or
notice
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
and
that
case,
i
think,
went
as
far
as
we
--
as
the
cases
have
gone
less
far
on
this
particular
issue.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
that's
a
very
close
question
and
a
rather
sticky
question,
sir.
and
as
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
--
referred
to
the
decision
in
this
court
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
well,
personally,
i
don't.
personally,
i
have
regarded
the
safe
place
to
work
is
based
upon
negligence.
and
in
my
complaint,
i
said
it
forth
in
that
way
is
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
--
as
a
portion
--
sir?
mr.
morris
d.
katz
is
there
any
doubt
about
it?
well,
i
refer
to
this
court
to
its
decision
in
the
west
case
several
weeks
ago.
in
which
apparently
the
attorney
representing
mr.
west
contended
that
there
were
two
absolute
duties,
one,
to
provide
a
seaworthy
vessel
and
the
other,
to
provide
a
safe
place
to
work.
and
this
court
held
at
that
time
that
there
is
only
one
absolute
duty
and
that
is
to
provide
a
seaworthy
vessel
with
respect
to
the
safe
place
to
work,
that's
a
negligence
count.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
that's
true,
sir.
and
--
and
as
matter
of
fact,
this
court
made
that
distinction.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
both
may
be
unseaworthy.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
well,
of
course
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
from
--
from
the
point
of
view
of
my
rationality
and
approaching
it
as
an
unseaworthy
condition,
both,
i
would
say,
are
unseaworthy
--
unseaworthy
conditions.
i
will
not
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
well,
that,
of
course
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
--
that
of
course
is
base
upon
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
--
based
upon
negligence.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
i
think
so,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
if
he
had
been
right.
and
the
evidence
showed
otherwise
at
the
trial
because
he
ruled
otherwise
at
the
trial
and
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
as
to
why
he
said
it,
sir,
i
cannot
answer
that.
and
i
say
that
with
profound
respect
for
judge
wyzanski.
but
i
do
say
this.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
the
record
shows
that
he
ruled
at
the
trial
upon
which
the
plaintiff
had
a
right
to
rely
and
did
rely.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
if
we're
fortunate
to
go
back
there,
it
may
come
up
again
and
will
be
the
subject
of
further
evidence
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
--
since
the
issue
has
been
raised
in
this
manner.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
that's
true,
sir.
that's
true.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
no,
sir.
i
do
not.
this
case
has
already
been
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
at
that
time.
i
think
the
plaintiff
had
a
right
to
rely
upon
the
ruling
the
judge
made
at
the
trial
and
cannot
--
and
i
don't
think
should
be
bound
by
a
memorandum
filed
by
the
judge
at
the
court
of
appeals
--
after
the
notice
for
appeal
has
been
filed.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
i
think
on
the
evidence
shown
is
not
correct,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
and
having
relied
upon
the
rulings
he
made
at
the
trial
and
being
for
one
of
this
possibility,
there
would
be
further
evidence
on
this
subject.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
when
the
judge
made
the
ruling,
that's
true,
sir.
when
the
judge
made
the
ruling
that
this
man
is
a
seaman,
employee,
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment,
that
ended
it
as
far
as
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
sir?
mr.
morris
d.
katz
no.
we
did
not.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
in
the
light
of
the
ruling.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
why
is
it
the
record?
mr.
morris
d.
katz
two
weeks
after
the
notice
for
appeal
was
filed,
this
memorandum
was
filed
in
the
district
court.
when
the
record
was
prepared,
i
ask
the
clerk
to
--
i
think
my
brother
has
included
in
his
portion
of
the
record
that
he
designate
it,
and
that's
how
it
gets
in.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
no,
sir.
there
was
not.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
yes,
sir,
and
after
the
notice
for
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
i
suppose
you
can
always
get
memorandum
if
the
judge
wants
to
file
them.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
but
--
but
did
not
the
--
i
--
i
submit,
sir,
did
not
the
plaintiff
had
the
right
to
rely
upon
the
rulings
made
by
the
trial
judge
at
and
during
the
trial
and
following
the
trial
upon
motion
by
counsel?
mr.
morris
d.
katz
there
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
precisely,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
but
the
memorandum
as
he
--
as
--
as
written
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
it
might
have
--
no,
sir.
it
has
no
relevancy
to
the
--
to
the
trial
of
this
case
or
to
the
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
i
--
i
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
that's
true.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
that
is
to
say
something
different,
sir.
in
this
case,
in
this
situation,
what
the
judge
did
is
he
filed
a
memorandum
which
contained
two
inconsistencies
with
--
with
his
ruling
at
the
trial.
and
that
is
why
i
say
the
plaintiff
should
not
be
bound
by
that
memorandum.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
precisely,
sir.
and
not
only
did
he
make
that
ruling
at
the
end
of
the
evidence,
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence
but
during
the
course
of
the
trial
he
made
that
ruling
which
relying
upon
that
ruling,
the
plaintiff
felt
there
was
no
necessity
for
introducing
any
further
evidence
on
that
issue.
i
think
the
discussion
in
the
questioning
on
this
--
on
this
matter
has
covered
a
great
portion
of
what
i
had
intended
as
a
prepared
argument.
but
there
are
certain
things
that
i
would
like
to
mention
briefly.
if
we
have
here
a
duty,
an
absolute
duty,
then
the
question
is
as
to
the
meaning
of
what
is
meant
by
“absolute”.
and
if
we
take
the
dictionary
meaning
of
“absolute”
which
is
stated
to
be
without
limitation
or
restriction
or
qualification,
then
there
should
be
no
limitation
or
qualification
or
restriction
upon
that
absolute
duty
even
with
respect
to
temporary
unseaworthy
conditions
if
they
can
be
so
described.
now,
notice
is
an
element
in
a
negligence
action.
i
don't
think
my
brother
will
dispute
that.
to
introduce
notice
into
an
unseaworthiness
case
is
to
breakdown
the
basic
distinction
between
these
two
causes
of
action
in
many
types
of
cases.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
true,
sir.
if
we
can
rely
upon
what
the
case
is
saying
and
there
is
an
absolute
duty,
and
the
absolute
duty
is
continuing
at
all
times
because
the
--
the
duty
on
the
part
of
the
seaman
is
to
serve
at
all
times,
then
even
after
the
commencement
of
a
voyage
and
even
when
the
unseaworthy
condition
as
complained
of
is
a
temporary
condition.
logic
requires
that
there
should
be
a
--
an
equal
extension
of
the
duties,
the
correlative
duties
one
to
the
other,
the
shipowner
to
the
seaman
and
the
seaman
to
the
shipowner.
if
the
seaman's
duty
continues
during
the
entire
period
that
he
is
in
the
service
of
the
vessel,
why
not
then
require
that
the
shipowner
provide
this
seaworthy
vessel
during
the
entire
period
that
this
man
is
in
its
service
both
before
the
vessel
commences
his
voyage
and
after.
and
the
two
specific
cases
on
that
point
after
the
dixon
case
did
not
resolved
it
where
the
poignant
case
and
the
hildebrandt
case,
hildebrandt
not
being
cited
on
my
brief
but
being
in
226
f.2d.
if
it
is
said
as
a
shipowner
may
say
that
this
is
harsh
doctrine
and
as
judge
magruder
said
in
his
opinion,
then
it
is
no
harsher
than
the
rigorous
demands
made
upon
the
seaman.
the
burden
of
the
shipowner
is
not
a
bit
more
rigorous
than
what
is
expected
of
the
seaman.
he
still
has
that
protection
that
i
mentioned
in
answer
to
questions,
the
question
of
fact
whether
or
not
in
fact
this
condition
complained
of
constitutes
an
unseaworthy
condition,
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury.
in
effect
and
in
summation,
i
would
say
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
really
an
assault
upon
the
law
and
a
challenge
to
the
logic
and
reason
as
presented
by
the
petitioner.
and
i
submit
further
it's
contrary
to
many
decisions
of
this
court
even
though
the
specific
question,
as
in
this
case,
was
not
there
answered.but
if
we
consider
the
implications
of
the
boudoin
case
and
the
petterson
case,
the
answer
is
found
in
those
cases.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
may
i
suggest,
sir,
that
if
the
implication
is
that
--
it
--
that
the
unseaworthy
condition
arising
after
the
commencement
of
the
voyage
is
the
question
than
in
any
of
the
stevedore
cases
whether
is
handling
of
cargo,
they
must
inevitably
had
occurred
after
the
voyage
began
otherwise
they
wouldn't
be
handling
cargo.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
based
--
mr.
morris
d.
katz
sir?
based
upon
the
arguments
presented,
it
is
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
in
error
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
morris
d.
katz
no,
your
honor.
thank
you.
