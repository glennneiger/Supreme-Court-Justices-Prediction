mr.
katz,
you
may
proceed.
chief

just
a
matter
of
curiosity.
what
kind
of
fish
were
these
they
are
fishing
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
katz,
following
through
on
justice
harlan's
question
to
you
a
moment
ago,
assuming
that
the
court
finds
in
your
favor
on
the
--
on
the
notice
issue,
is
there
a
problem
before
us
as
to
whether
this
is
--
where
the
ship
is
unseaworthy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
of
justice
whittaker's
questions
to
you,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
judge
took
it
out
of
the
case
in
the
very
first
sentence
of
his
charge
to
the
jury.
he
said
in
this
case,
“on
the
basis
of
rulings
i
made
earlier,
i
have
instructed
you
on
the
undisputed
fact,
mr.
mitchell
is
to
be
regarded
as
being
an
employee
of
the
defendant
and
therefore
entitled
to
those
rights,
if
any,
which
flow
from
the
maritime
law
and
flows
from
the
act
of
congress.”
he
took
it
out,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
whipple.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
the
point
you've
been
arguing
in
this
case,
the
only
question
was
the
question
of
notice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
what
is
--
as
to
whether
this
is
unseaworthiness
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
--
how
about
his
basis
of
his
charge
which
is
rather
important
in
the
case
and
part
i
--
i
read
a
few
moments
ago,
i
think,
its
on
page
11
of
the
--
of
the
record,
he
says
“in
this
case,
on
the
basis
of
rulings
i
made
earlier,
i
have
instructed
you
on
the
undisputed
fact
mr.
mitchell
is
to
be
regarded
as
being
an
employee
of
the
defendant
and
therefore
entitled
to
those
rights,
if
any,
which
flow
from
the
maritime
law
and
flows
from
the
act
of
congress.”
now,
isn't
that
memorandum
entirely
inconsistent
with
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
which
--
which
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
should
we
be
governed
by?
the
charge
or
the
memorandum?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
go
into
the
record
if
you
didn't
provided
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
the
record
in
--
this
is
the
record
in
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
record
in
this
court
and
you
put
in
this
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
