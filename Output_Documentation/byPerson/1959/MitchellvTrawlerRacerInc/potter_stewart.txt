mahnich,
that's
the
one.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
test
you
would
say
is
whether
or
not
it's
reasonably
fit
for
the
court's
intended
use?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
jury
might
find,
for
example,
that
the
--
the
rail
--
the
intended
use
of
this
rail
wasn't
to
walk
on.
justice
potter
stewart
in
response
a
moment
ago
to
--
a
few
moments
ago
to
mr.

as
to
whether
there
are
any
cases
here
based
which
--
which
go
to
hold
a
shipowner
liable
for
transitory
unseaworthiness,
isn't
it
the
petterson
case
although
a
per
curiam
decision
here,
isn't
that
rather
helpful
to
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
and

involve
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
that
involve
a
transitory
situation
in
effect
that
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
did
the
member,
if
the
opinion
says,
i
don't

how
long
have
the

were
--
there
was
--
there
was
--
the
record
showed
that
it
had
been
long
enough
on
the
--
on
the
deck
as
i
remember
to
charge
the
shipowner
with
notice
because
that
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
was
an
impermanent
condition
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
it
was
a
little
bit
more
transitory.
justice
potter
stewart
also
unseaworthiness.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
justice
whittaker
is
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
which
was
not
a
part
of
the

that
true?

aboard?
is
it
shown
here?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
no
part
of
the
regular
tackle
tail
of
the
ship
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
temporarily.
is
that
true?
i
mean
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
--
that
would
be
an
issue
for
the
jury
if
is
--
if
this
is
a
jury
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
you
to
say
that.
justice
potter
stewart
what
the
duty
is,
is
it
not,
is
to
exercise
reasonable
care
to
provide
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work.
justice
