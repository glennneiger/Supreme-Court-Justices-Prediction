mr.
feller,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.

mr.
carriger.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
percentage
of
disability
did
the
company
contend
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
when
you
have
this
--
this
agreed
judgment,
did
--
did
you
both
come
in
and
say
“well,
a
man
is
--
is
25%
percent
disabled,”
or
did
--
did
they
say
25
and
that
--
do
you
say
something
else
and
you
finally
agreed
to
at
25?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
much
less
--
how
much
less
did
they
claim?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
much
was
the
claim?
how
much
was
the
award?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
there
any
reason
why
an
arbitrator
couldn't
determine
that
as
you
see
--
as
you
could
tell
us
about
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
that
in
effect
showed
that
clear?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
have
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carriger,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
arbitrability
isn't
in
question
in
these
cases,
it
--
it's
a
--
i
thought
it
was
--
isn't
it
conceded
in
this
case
that
--
that,
if
there
were
substance
to
this
particular
claim,
that
it
would
be
arbitrable,
because
it
does
affect
conditions,
isn't
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
working
conditions
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
the
court
just
held
that
it
was
frivolous
and
therefore
--
therefore,
it
shouldn't
go
before
an
arbitrator.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
any
work
that
he
was
fitted
for,
be
a
question
for
the
arbitrator?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
feller.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
