mr.
john
s.
carriger
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
members
of
the
court.
this
in
a
way
might
be
said
to
the
--
in
the
particular
case
than
the
general
case
that
my
adversary,
as
on
to
playfulness
present
here
because
this
comes
under
the
statute,
labor
management
relations
generally
known
as
section
301
(a)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
and
yet
pursuant
to
that
statute
which
provides
that
suits
for
violation
of
contracts
between
an
employer
and
the
labor
organization
maybe
brought
in
the
district
court.
a
suit
was
brought
alleging
and
this
i
emphasize
because
in
the
decision
as
it
was
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
miller
in
his
concluding
paragraph
there
made
it
quite
positive
in
his
statement
that
this
is
an
alleged
grievance
rather
than
a
real
grievance,
that
this
is
so
clearly
a
baseless
one
that,
although
he
arrived
and
that
court
unanimously
arrived
at
a
different
course
but
arrived
at
the
same
result
has
tried
in
this
--
in
the
district
court
--
arrived
at
the
district
court.
that
this
was
not
a
case
where
the
complainant,
the
plaintiff,
the
union
had
shown
that
there
were
issues
to
be
presented.
now,
why
is
it
a
case
that
is
a
particular
one?
the
union
in
this
case,
the
original
plaintiff
in
the
district
court
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
we
submit,
may
it
please
this
court
that
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
are
applicable
to
summary
judgment
procedures
are
no
different
in
a
case
involving
the
labor
management
relations
act
or
a
labor
management
contract
or
agreement
then
it
would
be
in
any
other
matter
before
the
court.
now,
the
petitioner
in
asking
for
summary
judgment
did
so
fully
aware
of
the
rules
and
the
requirements.
the
petitioner,
the
union,
chose
not
to
bring
into
that
case
any
proof,
any
affidavit
or
anything
showing
in
the
pleadings
or
any
statement
from
this
man,
sparks
on
whose
behalf
this
suit
was
filed
that
he
was
entitled
to
this
relief.
now,
i
say
that
--
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
--
for
this
reason
that
it
is
necessary,
i
believe,
for
us
to
go
a
little
bit
into
the
facts
of
the
case
as
it
was
before
that
court
and
of
course
as
it
was
been
before
the
court
of
appeals
to
show
that
there
was
not
a
real
grievance
here.
there
was
no
issue
for
the
court
to
decide
in
the
position
that
the
union
took
both
there
and
in
court
of
appeals.
now,
if
the
federal
court
--
if
congress
in
under
301
had
any
purpose
other
than
that
the
court
should
initially
determine
whether
there
was
some
issue
to
submit,
why
was
this
section
301
at
the
labor
management
relation
act?
why
was
it
there?
why
couldn't
the
congress
simply
have
said,
“every
matter,
no
matter
how
foolish,
no
matter
how
clearly
baseless,
no
matter
what
the
plaintiff
comes
in
and
does
not
show,
once
it's
a
labor
management
discussion,
once
it's
in
--
an
alleged
grievance,
the
court
can
only
go
on
and
say
where
the
arbitrators
will
have
test
on
it.”
mr.
john
s.
carriger
that
suits
for
violation
of
contracts
maybe
brought
in
any
district
court.
then
if
the
court
please,
the
court
having
taken
jurisdiction,
the
union--
mr.
john
s.
carriger
well,
i
have
not
read
this
whole
sections
301.
mr.
john
s.
carriger
but,
i
link
that,
if
the
court
please,
with
the
provisions
in
the
requirements
of
the
summary
judgment
rules
which
i'd
like
to
quote
just
very
briefly
to
the
court
in
section
56
subsection
(c),
the
motion
and
procedure
thereon.
“the
judgment
sought
shall
be
rendered
forthwith
if
the
pleadings,
depositions
and
admissions
on
file
together
with
affidavits
of
any,
show
that
there
is
no
genuine
issue
as
to
any
material
fact.”
now,
there
was
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
a
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment.
in
other
words,
both
parties
moved
for
summary
judgment.
the
defendant,
american
manufacturing
company
and
it
is
a
small
plant,
its
contract
here,
i
think
some
12
or
13
pages
showed
that
it
had
no
way
of
employing
a
disabled
man.
it
showed
that
this
man,
spark,
one
week
before
the
union
filed
this
alleged
grievance
in
his
behalf
had
been
determined
to
be
25%
percent
totally
disabled
body
of
the
whole.
now,
mr.
feller
says
that
there
was
no
adjudication
to
that
effect.
this
was
an
adjudication
under
the
tennessee
law.
certainly,
it
was
--
it
could
be
computed
and
i
want
to
go
further
into
one
part
of
the
record
that
but
it
was
although
the
courts
in
that
decree
doesn't
say
25%
percent,
the
amount
that
the
board
and
the
whole
decision
of
the
court,
and
in
tennessee
we
do
have
that
in
court
decision
on
workmen's
compensation
matters,
was
base
on
a
25%
percent
permanent
total
disability.
but
in
addition
to
that
--
mr.
john
s.
carriger
--
fact
that
it
could
be
determined
--
mr.
john
s.
carriger
it
was
the
settlement
but
approved
by
the
court
on
basis
of
the
25%
disability.
mr.
john
s.
carriger
yes.
in
other
words,
the
petition
--
it
was
the
court
--
it
was
a
litigated
matter.
a
petition
was
filed.
we
did
not
appear
in
that
case.
there
were
other
counsel,
mr.
neil
thomas
of
our
bar
represented
the
defendant
in
that
case
--
mr.
john
s.
carriger
in
--
it
was
an
agreed
--
more
or
less,
an
agreed
finding,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
--
adversary
counsel
has
indicated
that
the
--
the
further
examination
called
for
was
by
the
company
doctor.
it
was
by
the
agreed
doctor,
doctor
shelton
who
was
the
one
who
had
examined
this
man
before,
before
the
hearing.
and
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
this
workmen's
compensation
claim.
mr.
john
s.
carriger
the
record
in
the
decree
indicates
that
the
man
claimed
more
and
the
company
possibly
claim
some
less
but
it
was
six
--
mr.
john
s.
carriger
there
was
never
--
so
far
as
i
know,
if
the
court
please,
there
was
never
anything
under
25%.
when
i
say
less,
i
mean
less
than
the
petitioner
claim
but
it
was
agreed
on
25%
percent.
now
if
the
court
please,
that
--
that
that
settlement
was
on
that
basis
it
shown,
may
it
please
the
court,
by
the
affidavit
in
summary
judgment
procedure,
the
affidavit
which
was
filed
by
mr.
neil
thomas
as
a
part
of
that
record
in
the
trial
court
in
which
he
showed
that
it
was
an
award
on
the
basis
of
25%
percent
permanent
disability.
now,
that
was
the
status,
that
matter
is
on
september
the
9th,
1957.
september
the
16th,
one
week
later,
the
union
filed
on
behalf
of
mr.
sparks
a
grievance
procedure.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
suggest
that
it
in
deference
to
mr.
feller,
that
this
is
a
grievance
here
not
on
this
charge
but
as
it
was
shown
in
--
in
the
plaintiff
original
procedure
and
in
all
the
records
here
as
a
grievance
alleging
a
violation
of
the
summary
judgment
procedure
--
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
a
violation
of
the
grievance,
a
violation
of
the
--
of
the
seniority
clause
of
the
contract.
now,
that
contract
between
the
parties,
the
labor
management
agreement
provided
in
section
2
that
the
management
retained
the
right
to
discharge
and
to
discharge
for
any
reason
handled
to
reduce
or
impair
the
efficiency
of
plant
operations.
when
this
man
proved
and
claimed
and
accepted
a
settlement
of
some
$3000
for
a
25%
percent
permanent
and
total
disability,
permanent
part
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
s.
carriger
approximately
3000
plus
certain
medical
expenses
and
doctors
hospital
bills
which
were
paid
in
full.
when
he
claimed
that
and
then
sought
to
be
restored
or
reinstated
in
his
job,
he
was
turned
down.
now,
in
one
place
in
the
grievance
they
speak
out
as
he's
being
released.
however,
it's
described
that
was
in
effect
a
discharge
of
that
man.
under
this
contract,
he
had
three
days
if
he
felt
that
that
was
an
improper
procedure,
he
had
three
days
within
which
to
file
a
written
protest
--
three
working
days
and
he
chose
not
to
do
it.
he
knew
that
dr.
shelton
and
dr.
kinsey
(ph),
dr.
kinsey
just
a
week
before
--
no
--
no
in
august,
august
24th
having
said
and
it's
in
the
record
here,
made
a
statement
that
this
man
has
a
25%
permanent
disability
of
the
body
as
a
whole.
and
in
my
opinion,
he
will
never
be
any
better
than
that,
that
will
not
improve.”
now,
that
was
in
august,
august
24th.
he
comes
into
court,
sparks
does,
on
september
the
9th
and
again
claims
and
accepts
a
25%
disability
award.
mr.
neil
thomas
in
his
affidavit
in
this
record,
the
attorney
who
represented
the
defending
insurance
company,
the
workmen's
compensation
carrier
said
in
his
affidavit
--
and
this
was
overlooked
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
overlooked
in
our
showing
before
that
court
that
this
was
a
settlement
based
on
that
25%
disability.
now,
that
25%
was
established.
it
could
be
also
established
by
reference
to
the
award
and
the
amount
of
award
and
the
allowance
under
the
tennessee
law.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
here
is
a
man
then
who
a
week
later
says
that
he
is
able
to
do
the
same
job,
manual
labor
in
a
plant
where
there
are
open
vats
that
acid
and
of
chemicals,
a
job
there,
it
has
been
shown
that
there
was
no
place
--
the
plant
where
there
was
no
place
for
a
man
who
is
partly
disabled
and
a
plant
where
they
had
no
job
for
a
disabled
man.
now,
both
in
the
management
division
and
in
the
grievance
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
s.
carriger
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
john
s.
carriger
i
think
it
was
down
to
this,
may
it
please
the
court.
does
a
district
court
have
to
channel
every
case
coming
before
it
to
arbitration
or
does
the
district
court
have
the
right
and
wasn't
at
the
thought
of
congress
that
it
had
the
obligation
to
read
out
those
where
both
at
the
time
of
the
parties
and
the
time
of
individuals
should
not
--
and
the
arbitrators
should
no
be
taken.
mr.
john
s.
carriger
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice
was
asking
at
the
noon
recess,
as
to
why
this
matter
would
not
be
determined
by
the
arbitrators
rather
than
being
submitted
through
the
court
procedure.
and
we
believe
that
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
act,
that
--
and
congress
had
in
mind
that
the
courts,
they're
not
the
arbitrators
based
on
contracts.
and
that
the
courts
determined
the
arbitrability.
now,
i
don't
have
the
say
in
his
reply
brief
has
--
mr.
john
s.
carriger
yes.
mr.
john
s.
carriger
for
the
determining
whether
or
not
arbitration
is
to
be
ordered
by
the
court.
mr.
john
s.
carriger
that
was
--
i
like
the
work
baseless,
that
although
in
phrase,
they've
copied
--
mr.
john
s.
carriger
--
the
court
has
used
these
--
the
combination
of
terms
that
has
been
used
in
other
courts
and
decisions.
but
here
what
both
judge
darr,
the
district
judge,
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
substance
was
that
there
was
no
evidence
on
which
the
arbitrators
--
in
other
words,
it
was
nothing
for
the
arbitrators
to
arbitrate.
that
it
was
so
baseless
and
so
clearly
so.
and
that
in
this
case,
where
the
burden
was
on
the
complainant
to
show
some
basis,
some
grounds
for
arbitration
and
where
the
complainant
had
failed
to
do
so,
although
calling
for
the
court
to
use
the
summary
judgment
procedure.
and
yet
then,
simply
bringing
in
a
statement
from
a
doctor,
dr.
kinsey,
this
man
was
able
to
go
back
to
a
job
without
injury
to
himself
or
others.
now,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“that
is
not
evidence,
when
you
have
in
the
record
there
on
the
summary
judgment
procedure.”
the
statements
of
that
same
doctor
may
just,
a
week
or
--
or
two
weeks
before,
that
this
man
is
permanently
disabled.
i'd
like
to
read
to
the
court,
very
briefly,
that
statement
from
dr.
kinsey,
which
appears
in
the
record
at
page
54
and
55.
and
this
was
is
august
of
1957.
“i
believe
his
disability
was
55%
or
60%
before
surgery.
they
--
the
back
operation
moved
a
disc.
and
i
believe,
it
is
approximately
25%
of
the
present
time.
i
also
believe
that
his
partial
permanent
disability
will
remain
at
about
25%.
and
it
was
on
25%
that
on
september
9th,
he
received
this
and
claimed
this
award
for
disability.”
then
a
week
later,
he
comes
back
and
applies
under
the
provision
for
reinstatement
as
employee
and
is
turned
down.
he
does
not
avail
himself.
he
knows
that
he
could
not
get
back
in
on
any
protest.
they
--
does
not
avail
himself
for
the
three
day
requirement,
of
filing
a
written
protest.
he
accepts
that
discharge.
then
trying
to
do
indirectly,
it
please
the
court,
what
he
could
not
do
directly,
we
submit,
he
--
through
the
union,
undertakes
to
be
reemployed
under
the
seniorioy
provisions.
now,
both
under
the
seniority
provision
and
under
this
matter
which
management
in
this
plant
had
and
the
union
agreed
to
it,
sold
a
necessity
for
them.
this
type
of
operations,
a
small
plant
with
wax
and
the
various
types
of
chemicals
and
liquids
about
a
department
where
a
man
had
to
be
men
and
had
do
to
the
work
and
had
to
be
able
and
efficient.
in
both
of
those
requirements,
the
contract
provided
and
recognized
that
ability
to
do
the
work,
able-bodiedness
and
equal
efficiency
must
be
considered.
now,
the
provision
in
the
seniority
definitely
--
and
provision
of
the
contract
definitely
recognizes
that
the
man
seeking
to
be
reemployed
and
that's
what
this
was
and
that's
the
word,
reemployment
in
that
seniority
provision
contract,
that
he
must
have
efficiency
and
ability
equal
to
others.
now,
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
it
was
definitely
shown
before
the
trial
court
and
never
has
any
claim
been
made
by
this
man,
nothing
in
the
complaint.
the
complainant,
the
plaintiff,
and
the
court
below
knew
this
contention.
they
agreed
that
dr.
shelton
might
examine
him
after
this
matter
of
grievance
had
been
claimed
and
they've
attempted
an
arbitration
arrangement.
they
agree
that
he
might
go
back
to
dr.
shelton.
and
if
the
court
please,
what
does
dr.
shelton
say
in
his
report
there?
on
november
14th,
dr.
shelton
--
of
1957,
dr.
shelton
had
been
ill
in
the
meantime.
there
was
delay
of
getting
his
examination,
“i
see
no
reason
to
change
my
opinion
as
stated
on
the
examination
of
august
the
28th,
1957.”
and
then
skipping
down,
“at
that
time,
i
estimated
his
permanent
partial
disability
to
be
25%,
for
the
body
as
a
whole,
for
his
particular
type
of
work,
i
see
no
change
in
the
physical
findings,
so
i
no
see
reason
to
change
my
opinion
as
expressed
on
that
examination.
it
is
my
opinion
that
he
should
not
be
placed
at
work
requiring
heavy
lifting
or
prolonged
stooping
or
bending”.
and
the
whole
evidence
and
his
--
the
whole
evidence
before
the
court
in
the
preceding,
was
that
in
this
department,
where
he
sought
to
be
reemployed.
a
man
could
not
do
the
work
without
getting
into
awkward
positions
and
stoop
and
bend.
and
dr.
kinsey
on
whom
he
relied
in
obtaining
the
disability
award
and
who
later
examined
him
and
found
that
he
--
in
his
opinion,
although
he
had
been
50
or
more
percent
disabled
before
the
operation.
in
he's
opinion,
this
man
was
never
to
be
more
than
25%
and
that
is
never
for
more
than
75%
able
and
efficient
as
compared
with
the
ordinary
able-bodied
man.
this
department
needed,
this
plant
did
have
a
place
for
disabled
men.
and
that
was
shown
in
the
record
by
the
plant
manager.
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
on
all
of
that
record,
the
court
could
only
say,
if
this
man's
claim
under
these
circumstances,
was
baseless.
that
he
did
not
have
something
that
the
time
with
the
arbitrators,
the
time
the
parties
should
be
determined
by
arbitration.
mr.
john
s.
carriger
the
court
please,
and
i'm
somewhat
at
lost
to
know
how
we
can
--
can
meet
the
requirements
of
the
summary
judgment
provisions
rules.
the
--
the
plaintiff
--
the
complainant,
nowhere
claimed
that
he
was
able
to
do
the
work.as
to
these
defenses
were
made
and
his
affidavits
went
in
--
in
compliance
for
the
summary
judgment
procedure,
he
did
not
attempt
to
amend
his
complaint.
he
did
not
come
in
by
any
affidavit
that
he
was.
and
although
the
attorney
who
had
represented
the
insurance
carrier
on
workman's
compensation
matter,
wrote
to
him
and
to
his
attorneys
and
said,
“if
there's
been
a
change,
we
need
to
know
about
it”.
why
was
it
that
you
--
that
you
claimed
and
obtained
there
an
award
on
a
basis
to
25%
and
now,
claimed
that
you're
able
to
do
the
work
in
that
department,
that
you're
not
disabled?
he
did
not
answer
it,
his
attorneys
did
not
answer
it.
and
that,
again,
is
shown
in
the
record.
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
submit
that
under
the
provisions
that
the
union,
the
complainant
sought
to
the
--
invoked
when
the
asked
for
a
summary
judgment
and
then
the
defendant
asked
for
summary
judgment.
that
that
placed
before
the
trial
court,
the
obligation
to
treat
it
on
the
record
as
it
was.
and
had
this
man
conscientiously
believed
that
he
could
do
the
work,
that
he
was
not
disabled,
that
he
was
of
equal
efficiency
and
ability
to
the
other
men
and
hold
on
to
do
that
type
of
work,
he
could've
amended
his
complaint.
he
never
in
his
complaint
said
he
was
able.
he
never
came
in
himself
and
said
he
was
able.
he
never
brought
in
dr.
kinsey
to
show
why
dr.
kinsey
a
few
--
a
short
time
before
he
had
said
he
was
permanently
disabled
and
why,
if
he
could,
and
he
couldn't.
it
stands
for
reason
that
they
could've
produced
that
evidence,
that
they
would
have
done
so.
then,
if
court
please,
we
submit
that
under
the
--
in
decisions
and
under
professor
cox's
statement.
and
there
our
adversary
has
mentioned
professor
cox
in
a
number
of
places
in
that
brief
and
--
and
actually
this
brief
is
found
was
against
or
in
connection
with
three
cases.
i'm
only
familiar
with
this
one.
i
can
only
speak
in
connection
with
this
one
case.
but
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
and
reply
quoting
also
from
professor
cox,
who
has
been
relied
on
extensively
by
our
adversary,
in
the
same
article
in
1959
in
the
harvard
law
review,
reflections
on
labor
arbitration.
“arbitration
should
be
ordered
in
an
action
under
section
301.
whenever
that
claim
might
be
fairly
be
said
to
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
if
the
latter
contention
be
made,
but
appears
patiently
frivolous,
arbitration
should
be
denied.”
now,
our
adversary
in
the
reply
brief
filed,
mr.
feller
says,
that
he
agrees
that
arbitration
of
these
matters
should
be
only
at
the
order
of
the
court.
that
the
court
determines
arbitrability.
he
says
we
have
not
indicated
how
arbitrability
would
be
determined
by
the
court.
now,
we
submit
if
court
please,
that
determination
of
arbitrability
and
this
is
the
word
--
wording
in
judge
(inaudible)
in
the
(inaudible)
case
cited
in
our
brief,
251
f.2nd.
determination
of
arbitrability
only
requires
that
the
moving
party
could
evidence
which
tends
to
establish
his
claim.
we
submit
that
--
if
the
court
please,
that
in
this
case,
the
complainant,
the
moving
party
did
not
establish
any
evidence.
did
not
introduce
any
evidence,
either
in
his
pleadings,
did
not
even
make
the
claim
in
the
complaint.
but
simply
said,
here
is
something
it
must
be
arbitrated
and
as
the
court
passes
on
for
arbitration.
now,
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
question
here
is
we
believe,
boiled
down
to
this.
is
the
district
court
powerless
to
hold
an
alleged
grievance,
not
arbitrable,
where
the
complaining
union
moves
for
a
summary
judgment,
but
fails
to
make
any
showing
of
a
real
arbitrable
issue.
and
we
feel
that
the
court
does
have
the
right
and
that
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
both,
although
they
reached
the
conclusion
by
different
channels.
both
found
that
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff
had
not
carried
out
that
minimum
requirement.
i'm
showing
that
there
were
some
basis,
some
grounds
on
which
arbitration
--
for
which
arbitration
should
be
awarded.
