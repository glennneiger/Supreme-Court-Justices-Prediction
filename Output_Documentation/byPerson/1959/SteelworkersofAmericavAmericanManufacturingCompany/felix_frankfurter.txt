new
york
courts
have
taken
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
answer
by
--
as
we
look
at
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
feller,
may
i
suggest
that
i
think
it
would
help
some
of
us
if
you
would
put
an
arbitration
provision
and
a
collective
agreement
in
the
context
in
which
an
arbitration
agreement
is
found
in
a
collective
labor
agreement
as
against
the
arbitration
provision
in
a
commercial
contract,
namely
that
the
arbitration
provision
in
the
collective
agreement
is
part
of
a
detailed
government
for
industry
which
the
commercial
of
the
arbitration
provisions
are
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
arbitration
agreement
is
the
--
is
the
apex
of
a
layer
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
grievance
procedures
for
governing
industry
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
particular
and
sometimes
a
vast
industry
like
the
steel
industry
or
vast
plants
like
the
fourth
plant
as
against
the
episodic
provision
which
comes
into
play
the
commercial
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
stages
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
produce
within
the
--
the
time
recess
is
over,
a
copy
of
this
â€“
of
the
last
steel
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
before
this
case
is
finished.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
gives
you
tomorrow
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
you
can
give
it
to
the
clerk
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
pages
in
the
pamphlet
you
hold
in
your
hand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
remember
the
fourth
context,
isn't
any
smaller?
not
much
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
credit
for
the
draftsman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
would
also
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
also
to
add
that
many
strikers
taking
place
or
cause
it
to
an
outsider
for
subsequent
mediator
seems
trivial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
remember
one
of
the
most
contentious
controversies
before
(inaudible)
the
young
woman
should
be
allowed
to
wear
seductive
blouses.
this
is
a
very
(inaudible)
problem,
very
(inaudible)
problem.
in
fact,
i
saw
the
other
day
the
same
question
has
come
up
in
connection
with
the
english
women.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
in
your
view
are
the
limiting
words
of
the
statute
which
determine
this
--
this
problem
as
you
see
it?
what
are
the
limiting
words?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
the
words
that
--
that's
all
there
is,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
but
that's
all
that's
relevant
that
you
deem
relevant.
