justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
many
account
of
my
settlements,
mr.
feller,
made
under
the
law
of
the
state.
is
an
award
made
or
compromise
proved
in
some
way
has
become
permission
to
action?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
is
that
the
rule
be
different
in
one
of
type
of
case
over
another
if
the
parties
have
agreed
that
jurisdiction
shall
vest
in
a
private
court
over
a
certain
type
of
controversy,
you
must
give
effect
to
the
contract,
isn't
that
the
end
of
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
what
arbitrators
are.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
said
it's
a
very
what
contract?
you
said
is
a
very
what
contract?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
regard
this
as
a
seniority
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
do
not
understand
you
mean
by
that
or
do
you
mean
by
that
that
either
the
union
or
the
employer
are
bound
to
submit
two
arbitrators
things
they
did
not
agreed
to
submit.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
when
you
it
makes
a
claim
that
he
has
violated
the
agreement,
i
understand
that
he
--
he
would
make
the
same
claim
that
is
within
the
terms
that
the
parities
have
agreed
shall
be
arbitrated.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
it
has
to
be
with
respect
to
interpretation
or
application.
