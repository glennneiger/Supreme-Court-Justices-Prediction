mr.
david
e.
feller
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
number
360,
the
american
manufacturing
case
is
the
first
of
three
cases
which
the
court
has
set
down
for
a
consecutive
argument
which
deal
generally
with
the
questions
of
the
role
of
the
courts
in
enforcing
arbitration
and
enforcing
arbitration
awards
in
suits
arising
under
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
act
in
consequence
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
lincoln
mills
case,
353
u.s.
just
a
little
more
than
two
years
ago.
two
other
cases,
the
first
two,
number
360
and
number
443,
involved
a
refusal
by
a
company
to
arbitrate
grievances.
the
third
case
involves
the
case
where
there
was
a
refusal
to
arbitrate,
the
court
ordered
arbitration,
the
employer
refused
to
comply
with
the
award
and
the
question
arises
at
the
tail
end
of
the
process
as
the
case
comes
here
in
terms
of
--
of
the
authority
of
the
court
in
enforcing
--
the
role
of
the
court
in
enforcing
the
arbitration
award.
now,
before
we
get
into
the
three
cases,
i
think
one
thing
should
be
said
about
all
three.
all
three
represent
normal
collective
bargaining
agreements.
there
are
differences
in
the
arbitration
provisions
and
we'll
advert
to
them
as
we
come
to
them
but
there's
nothing
peculiar
about
the
contracts
involved
here.
but
the
cases
are
peculiar.
they
are
atypical
in
the
sense
that
the
question
is
here
at
all.
grievances
like
the
grievances
involved
in
these
three
cases
are
being
arbitrated
by
the
hundred
and
thousands
everyday
under
arbitration
clause,
is
no
different
to
these.
it
is
a
rare
case.
i
think
harry
shulman
once
said
it
that
--
and
i
think
perhaps
it
was
reflected
in
the
opinions
--
has
been
reflected
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
that
it
is
the
atypical
case
that
gets
into
litigation.
now,
the
reason
i
stressed
that
point
that
in
dealing
with
cases
which
are
atypical
because
of
the
employer's
refusal
to
arbitrate
the
kinds
of
grievances
which
most
employers
arbitrate
under
similar
contracts.
the
court,
in
dealing
with
this
fringe
kind
of
employers
if
i
may
so,
will
necessarily
have
an
effect.
the
decision
will
necessarily
have
an
effect
on
the
arbitration
process
as
it
is
practiced
throughout
the
country
in
industrial
relations
generally.
i
think
every
informed
student
of
the
subject
has
expressed
concern
about
some
of
these
very
cases
because
of
the
effect
which
they
will
have,
unnecessarily
have
in
the
arbitration
process
which
is
so
far
undisturbed.
and
so
with
that
preliminary
statement,
let
me
turn
to
a
statement
of
the
facts
in
the
american
manufacturing
case.
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple.
contract
was
executed
in
december
1956.
it
contained
an
arbitration
provision
which
is
perhaps
we
have
referred
to
it
as
the
same
as
the
standard
arbitration
provision.
it's
set
out
in
full
in
the
record,
several
places
in
--
for
convenience
on
our
brief.
we
have
a
combined
brief
in
those
three
cases
on
page
43.
the
arbitration
provision
in
this
agreement
provides
that,
“any
disputes,
misunderstandings,
differences
or
grievances
arising
between
the
parties
as
to
the
meaning,
interpretation
and
application
of
the
provisions
to
this
agreement,
which
are
not
adjusted
as
herein
provided,
may
be
submitted
to
the
board
of
arbitration
for
decision.
the
arbitrator
may
interpret
the
agreement
and
apply
it
to
a
particular
case
but
shall
have
no
authority
to
add
to,
subtract
from,
or
modify
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
the
final
clause
of
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator
shall
be
final
and
binding.”
in
the
footnote
at
that
page,
we
have
indicated
that
this
is
in
substance,
the
arbitration
provision
which
has
become
the
standard
american
arbitration
provision.
variations
in
language
occur
but
essentially,
it
limits
the
arbitration
to
questions
of
interpretation
and
application
and
provides
that
the
decision
shall
be
final
and
binding.
now,
during
the
course
of
this
agreement,
of
course
it
contains
other
provisions
on
the
arbitration
clause,
it
contains
a
seniority
clause.
during
the
term
of
this
agreement,
the
grievant,
a
man
named
sparks,
suffered
an
injury
to
his
back
on
march
1957.
he
--
within
a
few
weeks
after
he
suffered
the
injury,
he
filed
a
very
simple
petition
asking
for
workmen's
compensation
under
the
tennessee
law
filed
in
the
court.
in
september
1957
while
he
was
still
off
from
work,
the
workmen's
compensation
proceeding
was
settled
on
a
compromised
basis.
the
settlement
recited
that
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
whether
there
had
been
an
injury
in
the
course
of
employment.
but
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
whether
sparks
was
temporarily
disabled
and
the
extent
of
his
temporary
disability.
there
was
also
a
dispute
as
to
whether
he
was
permanently
disabled
and
the
extent
of
his
permanent
disability
and
that
the
settlement
as
a
compromise
of
these
various
disputes
would
seem
to
be
a
fair
compromise
and
the
matter
what's
settled.
thereupon,
sparks
applied
for
reinstatement
to
his
job
and
submitted
to
the
employer
a
statement
that
he
was
able
to
return
to
his
job
without
danger
to
himself
or
to
others.
well,
this
is
not
an
unusual
case,
there
are
many
people
who
have
partial
disabilities
who
are
working.
and
the
fact
that
a
man
gets
a
partial
disability
payment
doesn't
necessarily
preclude
him
from
working.
and
of
course,
people
do
recover
from
disabilities
even
if
a
doctor
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
disability
will
be
permanent.
the
company
refused
to
reinstate
him.grievance
was
filed
by
the
union.
grievance
was
not
settled,
the
union
asked
that
the
grievance
be
submitted
to
arbitration
claiming
that
under
the
seniority
provisions
of
the
agreement,
sparks
was
entitled
to
return
to
work.
the
company
--
this
--
this
contract
as
a
tripartite
board
of
arbitration,
sometimes
don't.
the
union
appoints
one
member.
the
company
appoints
one
member.
the
two
appoint
a
third
man
who
is
really
the
man
who
decides
the
case.
usually,
when
you
do
provide
--
so
provide,
actually,
the
parties
name
the
third
member
and
the
two
act
just
as
consultants
on
either
side.
in
any
case,
the
union
named
its
member
of
the
board
of
arbitration
and
he
got
in
touch
with
the
company,
the
company
named
its
member
of
board
of
arbitration,
then
the
company
suggested
that
the
union
submit
a
name
of
prospective
arbitrators,
the
union
did
that.
and
then
the
company
said,
”well,
hold
off
holding
--
naming
this
arbitrator.
we
want
to
examine
this
mr.
sparks
again.”
and
it
was
held
off.
they
examined
mr.
sparks
again.
the
company
doctor
submitted
a
report
saying
that
he
thought
that
sparks
was
--
still
remained
disabled
and
should
not
be
put
on
a
job
which
required
heavy
lifting.
that
was
the
extent
of
his
finding.
thereupon,
the
company
said,
”we
refuse
to
arbitrate
on
the
ground
that
this
matter
has
been
adjudicated
in
a
court.”
of
course,
actually,
the
court
never
adjudicated
anything
as
it
was
settled.and
second
of
all,
even
if
it
had
adjudicated
anything,
it
didn't
adjudicate
the
question
of
whether
he
was
able
to
return
to
work.
most
of
adjudicated
that
he
had
25%
disability
which
should
in
fact
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
it's
not
in
tennessee,
it's
not
in
the
court,
your
honor.
and
the
compromise
settlement
must
be
approved
by
the
--
i
think
there's
the
--
the
circuit
court.
and
the
approval
is
listed
on
page
31
of
the
record
in
this
case.
there
is
a
decree,
settlement
approval
which
is
required
under
the
workmen's
compensation
statute
which
recites
that
the
court
being
of
the
opinion
of
the
said
settlement
and
compromises
proper
and
in
accord
with
the
court
with
the
workmen's
compensation
law,
it
is
ordered
that
it
be
approved.
well,
the
union
brought
suit
to
compel
arbitration.
the
parties
cross
moved
for
summary
judgment.
the
matter
was
heard
on
the
pleadings
in
affidavits.
there
was
no
dispute
about
any
of
the
facts
which
i
have
so
far
stated.
the
company
--
the
district
court
gave
judgment
for
the
defendant
refusing
arbitration
on
the
ground
that
sparks
having
asserted
and
submitted
a
doctor's
certificate
saying
that
in
the
doctor's
opinion,
he
would
remain
25%
percent
disabled
was
estopped
from
asserting
his
--
any
right
to
reinstatement
under
the
collective
bargaining.
the
union
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
sixth
circuit
said,
“first,
the
question
of
estoppel,
if
there
is
one,
is
one
for
the
arbitrator.”
this
maybe
a
good
defense
against
this
claim
for
reinstatement
under
the
contract
but
that's
a
question
of
the
arbitrator,
not
for
the
court.
also
disposed
of
a
--
on
a
different
claim
which
the
company
had
made
that
the
matter
had
been
adjudicated
in
the
circuit
court
of
hamilton
county,
tennessee
by
saying,
“nothing
had
been
adjudicated
in
the
circuit
court.”
and
then
said,
”well,
it
is
clear
that
there
is
a
seniority
provision
in
here.
there
are
limitations
on
the
company's
right
to
discharge
employees
and
there
would
appear
to
be
a
question
of
the
interpretation
and
application
of
this
agreement
which
would
be
arbitrable
except
as
may
here
and
after
appear.”
that's
almost
an
exact
quote
from
what
the
court
said.
and
then
it
went
in
to
the
here
and
after.
they
said,
“now,
looking
at
this
contract
has
the
seniority
clause
which
says
that
in
cases
of
promotion
and
transfer
and
reemployment,
seniority
shall
be
a
factor
if
ability
and
efficiency
are
equal.”
now,
we
cannot
see
how
anybody
can
sensibly
claim
that
sparks'
ability
and
efficiency
are
equal
to
those
of
other
employees
if
he
has
a
25%
percent
disability.
now,
his
doctor's
certificate
that
he's
able
to
return
to
work,
we
think
is
not
evidence
of
sufficient
probative
value
to
even
raise
a
question.
we
think
this
isn't
just
frivolous,
it's
baseless.
and
we
hold
that
if
a
grievance
is
so
frivolous
and
baseless,
that
it
couldn't
possibly
be
granted
except
to
imply
there,
i
suppose
by
an
idiot
or
a
fool,
it
can't
go
to
an
arbitrator.
the
implication
i
suppose
being,
the
arbitrator
might
be
an
idiot
or
a
fool.
and
so
the
court
held
that
the
grievance
was
not
arbitrary.
now,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
at
length,
the
court's
reasoning
on
the
contract.
but
actually,
on
any
analysis,
the
court
of
appeals
made
some
rather
difficult
--
there's
also
very
difficult
questions
of
contract
construction
and
interpretation
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
question
was
so
frivolous
that
it
couldn't
go
to
arbitration
because
this
contract
is
not
at
all
clear
as
most
contracts
are
not
in
many
respects.
the
seniority
provision
dealing
with
promotions,
transfers
and
reemployment
was
assumed
by
the
court
to
deal
with
the
question
of
a
man's
right
to
come
back
to
work
when
he's
been
off
sick.
there
are
specific
clauses
dealing
with
sickness
and
disability
of
the
contract
but
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
a
man
who
was
off
sick
has
to
meet
the
requirement
that
his
ability
and
efficiency
be
equal
to
other
employees
if
ask
to
come
back
to
work
after
his
sickness.
he
might
have
been
unequal
on
the
first
place.
a
very
good
argument
and
i
think
the
more
logical
interpretation
of
this
agreement
is
that
if
a
man
is
off
sick,
there
are
particular
provisions
saying
he
has
to
give
notice
that
he
is
going
to
be
off
sick
to
preserve
his
seniority
status.
that
if
he's
off
sick,
he's
entitled
to
come
back
to
work
unless
as
a
result
of
the
sickness,
he
is
dischargeable.
and
the
contract
clause
does
provide
for
discharges
where
a
man's
work
is
of
such
quality
that
he
would
justify
discharge.
and
so
this
question
really
wasn't
a
seniority
grievance
but
it
was
a
discharge
grievance.
i
don't
think
this
court
isn't
the
arbitrator
no
more
than
i
think
the
sixth
circuit
was
the
arbitrator.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
to
get
into
it.
but
it
can
very
well
be
argued
that
if
i'm
off
sick
and
i
get
a
cold
and
i'm
off
work
for
five
days
and
the
same
rule
has
to
apply
in
the
disability
case,
i
don't
have
to
come
back
to
my
job
and
prove
that
i'm
better
or
equal
in
ability
as
the
man
who
took
my
job
on
a
temporary
basis
while
i
was
away.
most
arbitrators
would
say,
“you're
entitled
to
come
back
to
your
job
unless
there
is
ground
for
discharging.”
and
the
question
on
promotion
as
to
what
this
clause
was
written
for
where
two
or
three
people
bid
for
a
job,
the
employer
only
agrees
that
if
their
ability
and
efficiency
are
equal
then
the
senior
man
will
get
the
job.
you're
making
a
comparison
between
three
people.
but
when
you
say,
“i'm
coming
back
to
work.”
whose
ability
and
efficiency
do
you
have
to
equal?
the
guy
who
took
your
job?
well,
maybe
his
ability
and
efficiency
are
better
but
then
what
about
some
other
job
which
the
seniority
might
be
entitled
to
you
in
the
department.
he
measures
your
efficiency
against
the
--
the
least
able
and
the
least
efficient.
what
if
there
are
just
plain
other
people
who
have
10%,
15%,
25%
disabilities?
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
no.
your
honor,
i
should
have
gone
into
this
at
great
length
because
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
it
is
our
central
contention
here
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
business
determining
whether
this
grievance
was
frivolous
or
not
frivolous.
our
contention
in
this
case
and
to
the
succeeding
case
is
a
very
simple
one.
when
a
contract
provides
that
any
difference
or
grievance
involving
a
question
of
interpretation
or
application
of
agreement
arrived
which
cannot
be
settled
and
as
that
grievance
will
be
settled
by
arbitration.
then
if
the
employer
refuses
to
comply
with
that
obligation,
the
only
questions
for
the
court
are,
one,
is
there
a
question
of
interpretation
or
application,
a
difference
as
to
the
meaning
of
a
contract
in
this
case?
and
two,
has
the
employer
refused
to
arbitrate?
now,
there
are
people
and
we
do
not
expressly
make
this
contention.
there
are
those
who
have
said
that
arbitrability
ought
to
be
for
the
arbitrators.
but
we
are
not
making
that
contention
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
arbitrability
should
be
for
the
arbitrators.
we
recognize
as
i
think
every
informed
writer
recognizes
that
the
court
is
not
an
automaton
or
robot
to
order
arbitration
simply
because
you
went
in
and
say
there's
an
agreement
that
an
arbitration
clause
ordered
direct
the
employer
to
arbitrate.
the
court
has
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
breach
of
a
promise.
we
are
here
essentially
on
a
contract
theory.
but
we
say
it
fulfills
that
duty
of
adjudication
when
it
finds
a
--
and
as
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
provision
requiring
arbitration
of
every
question,
every
judgments
arising
under
the
contract
involving
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
contract
and
that
--
that
the
employer
has
refused
to
do
it.
it
is
none
of
the
court's
business
to
determine
whether
the
union
has
a
good
case,
a
bad
case,
a
case
that
looks
like
it
might
be
doubtful
or
a
case
which
seems
to
report
absolutely
clear.
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
this
scope
of
the
court's
duty
seems
to
us
so
clear
that
the
marvel
is
that
there's
any
argument
about
it.
but
strangely
enough,
there
has
been
a
tremendous
amount
of
argument.
mr.
david
e.
feller
federal
courts
are
in
the
business
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
the
federal
courts
are
in
this
business
only
recently.
new
york
courts
had
been
in
it
for
some
years
pursuant
to
the
statute.
and
in
new
york,
there
has
developed
what
is
called
the
cutler-hammer
doctrine
after
the
case
cutler-hammer
company
versus
the
machinists.
cutler-hammer
doctrine
says
that
if
the
answer
in
a
given
case
is
so
clear
but
there
isn't
any
doubt
about
the
result.
if
a
grievance
is
so
clear
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes.
then
there's
no
question
to
arbitrate.
that's
what
they
said.
and
--
that
actually,
that
some
doubt
with
the
new
york
courts
still
today
in
practice
follow
the
cutler-hammer
doctrine
but
this
is
essentially
without
naming
the
cutler-hammer
case.
essentially,
the
court
below
and
the
sixth
circuit
here
adopted
the
cutler-hammer
approach.
they
said,
“this
is
such
a
frivolous
grievance
that
we
aren't
going
to
order
anybody
to
arbitrate.”
now,
with
difficulty
of
course
with
that
doctrine
and
that
limitation
on
the
agreement
is
first,
that
on
the
very
appeal,
the
verbal
level,
the
contract
doesn't
say
all
doubtful
questions
shall
be
arbitrated.
all
questions
which
may
appear
to
a
court
that
involve
some
questions
of
doubt
maybe
arbitrated,
it
says
all
questions.
now,
i
think
that
the
cutler-hammer
doctrine
is
bad
law
even
if
these
were
not
a
labor
agreement.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
labor
agreement
and
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
very
different
consequences
which
follow
from
the
adoption
of
cutler-hammer
or
similar
doctrine
as
the
second
circuit
has
--
in
this
very
(inaudible)
scope
case
indicated
that
you
have
to
make
--
make
a
prima
facie
showing
that
there
is
some
issue
involved.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
think
it's
the
end
of
it
but
i
think
that
the
consequences
of
different
results
are
different
because
in
a
typical
non-labor
contract,
a
commercial
contract,
what
the
parties
do
as
your
honor
said,
is
provide
a
private
court
in
place
of
the
public
courts.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
but
this
is
not
true
in
a
labor
contract.
in
fact,
the
alternative
to
arbitration
historically.
there's
no
question
that
parties
in
a
labor
agreement
do
not
agree
to
arbitrate
rather
than
litigate.
what
they
agreed
to
do
is
arbitrate
rather
than
strike.
the
real
alternative
which
is
bargained
for
and
i
think
this
court
expressly
stated
it
in
the
lincoln
mills
case.
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
is
the
quid
pro
quo
for
the
agreement
not
to
strike.
in
the
absence
of
a
no-strike
clause
and
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
which
go
hand
in
hand
and
usually
verbal,
a
union
has
the
right
protected
under
section
7
on
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
strike
an
employer
if
it
believes
that
the
employer
is
not
complying
with
this
agreement.
historically,
unions
have
never
looked
to
the
law
force
to
adjudicate
their
disputes.
i'd
like
to
quote
--
i
think
the
privy
council
and
a
very
famous
case
really
stated
what
a
labor
agreement
is,
absent
the
agreement
to
arbitration
where
they
described
in
young
versus
canadian
northern
railway,
31
--
1931
appealed
cases
at
page
83
quoting
from
page
89,
in
talking
about
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
says
that
“it
appears
to
their
lordships
to
be
intended
merely
to
operate
as
an
agreement
between
a
body
of
employers
and
a
labor
organization
by
which
the
employers
undertake
that
as
regard
to
their
workman,
certain
rules
beneficial
to
the
workman
shall
be
observed.”
if
an
employer
refused
to
observe
the
rules,
the
effective
sequel
would
not
--
would
be
not
an
action
by
any
employee,
not
even
an
action
by
division
number
four
which
is
the
organization
against
the
employer,
but
the
calling
of
the
strike
until
the
grievance
was
rendered.
mr.
david
e.
feller
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
--
i've
been
--
i
--
i
--
mr.
david
e.

that's
what
i'm
attempting
to
do.
mr.
david

feller
grievance
procedure,
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct.
in
which
the
arbitrator
typically
is
awarding
damages
on
a
claim
that
one
party
or
the
other
has
not
delivered
goods,
has
not
complied
with
its
construction
contract
and
the
question
is
resolving
the
rights
of
the
parties
in
wrapping
the
transaction
up.
rather
than
going
to
a
court,
the
party
say,
“it's
faster.
it's
less
complicated.
it's
less
expensive.
we
get
smarter
people.
let's
arbitrate
rather
than
litigate.”
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
you
have,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
just
said,
a
set
of
rules
to
govern
an
industrial
relationship
which
involve
thousands
and
thousands
of
questions
which
must
be
resolved
in
reference
to
a
tiny
little
contract
even
in
basic
steel
which
we
have
a
more
complicated
contract
than
most
of
the
very
little
contracts
and
it's
(voice
overlap)
all
these
cases.
mr.
david
e.
feller
small
contract
which
in
effect
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
(voice
overlap)
of
the
basic
codes
for
the
carrying
on
of
the
industrial
relationship
between
the
employer
and
the
employee
and
which
the
parties
provide
for
their
own
tribunal
to
interpret,
apply,
and
explicate
the
very
small
number
of
words
which
of
necessity
must
govern
a
very
large
and
very
kind
of
continuing
relationship.
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes,
sir.
i
would
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
i
will
produce
it
--
no,
i
can
produce
it
by
2:30.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
can
produce
it
right
now.
mr.
david
e.
feller
this
is
the
copy
of
the
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
this
–
this
agreement
is
--
when
i
say
this
in
a
large
one,
it
depends
on
how
this
runs,
102
pages.
this
governs
the
relationships
between
parties.
well,
this
governs
100,000
employees
on
every
aspect
to
the
relationship
of
rights
to
jobs,
rights
to
pay,
overtime,
scheduling,
seniority,
everything.
mr.
david
e.
feller
it's
a
little
bigger.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
a
little
bigger.
the
contract
in
this
case
is
–
is
a
minimal
number
of
pages
if
your
honor
will
note.
as
they
have
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
no.
i
think,
it's
a
--
as
your
unit
gets
larger
and
more
problems
become
acute,
you
deal
more
explicitly
with
problems
than
you
do
in
a
contract
covering
a
smaller
unit
where
much
exists
as
a
result
of
common
understanding
without
specification.
the
larger
the
unit,
the
larger
the
necessity
comes
to
be
a
little
more
specific
because
the
common
understanding
is
not
so
common
when
plants
are
spread
across
the
country
and
cover
up
great
--
great
variety
of
operations.
that's
the
reason
as
you
get
bigger,
you
tend
to
have
a
more
complicated
contract.
actually,
curiously
enough,
the
seniority
question
which
is
involved
here.
the
rights
of
an
employee
on
reinstatement
after
absent
for
illness
is
not
dealt
within
this
contract
either,
specifically.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
the
question
is,
is
it
a
seniority
question
or
is
it
a
discharge
question?
that's
a
very
difficult
question.
i
think
it's
a
combination.
i
hate
to
attempt
to
turn
this
court
right
after
justice
harlan
has
adjured
me
not
to
into
the
board
of
arbitration
under
this
grievance.
well,
i
think
the
question
in
this
grievance
is
whether
this
man
on
the
finding
of
the
facts,
could
be
said
to
have
such
a
disability
that
he
was
subject
to
discharge.
absent
that,
he
is
entitled
to
whatever
job
in
the
unit
his
seniority
entitles
him
to,
under
whatever
the
rules
are
which
are
not
spelled
out
in
this
contract
as
to
relative
seniority
whether
it's
plant-wide,
department-wide,
unit-wide,
i
don't
know
what
it
is
because
the
contract
doesn't
say.
this
is
again
the
matter
of
practice
which
arbitrators
as
the
adjudicators
of
the
controversies
like
this
are
peculiarly
able
to
resolve.
but
i
want
to
finish
what
i
attempted
to
say
with
you,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
the
effect
of
an
arbitration
provision.
and
many
of
the
decisions
have
failed
to
notice,
the
importance
is,
in
a
holding
that
a
dispute
is
not
arbitrated,
or
that
the
court
should
decide
whether
there
is
doubt
in
the
grievance
is
that
you
are
not
simply
not
giving
enough
grievance
to
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
putting
it
back
where
it
would
have
been
in
the
first
place,
which
is
the
case
in
the
commercial
contract.
in
the
absence
of
arbitration,
the
court
would
decide
it.
so
perhaps
our
ideas
of
giving
respect
to
the
party's
wishes
are
offended
if
we
say
despite
the
agreement
to
arbitrate,
we'll
let
the
court
look
into
it.
but
when
you
do
it
with
the
labor
agreement,
you
do
something
far
different.
what
you
say,
this
is
not
arbitrable
and
if
you
have
a
no-strike
clause
of
the
kind
that's
involved
in
all
these
three
cases,
which
says
you
can't
strike.
you're
saying
you
can't
arbitrate
and
you
can't
have
what
you
would
have
had
if
you
didn't
have
the
no-strike
arbitration
clause.
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
employer's
action
is
completely
ungoverned.
you
are
not
saying
that
the
matter
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
ungoverned
or
under,
the
union
has
rendered
this
because
the
alternative
is
not
the
same,
well,
then
go
sue
on
the
contract
or
have
the
matter
decided.
i
thought
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
am
arguing
in
the
context
of
what
i
have
called
the
standard
arbitration
clause
and
i'm
not
arguing
that
--
that
they
have
--
have
to
submit
to
arbitration
that
which
they
did
not
agree
to
arbitrate.
well,
i
am
arguing
and
this
argument
will
become
critical
in
the
next
case,
is
that
when
they
agree
to
arbitrate
all
questions
of
interpretation
and
applications
and
they
also
agree
on
an
absolute
no-strike
clause
barring
the
relief
which
the
union
would
have
otherwise
in
the
absence
of
the
no-strike
arbitration
clause.
that
in
that
case,
the
court
should
construe
the
questions
of
interpretational
application
which
the
parties
commit
to
the
arbitrator
precisely
as
they
say
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
there
are
any
doubts,
you
should
give
the
broadest
possible
scope
to
the
arbitration
provision
because
the
consequence
of
the
court
saying
that
the
dispute
is
not
arbitrated,
is
not
as
it
is
in
the
commercial
contract
that
is
litigable.
the
consequence
is
that
you
are
saying
that
this
controversy
is
one
which
the
employer
wins
because
the
union
has
given
up
the
right
to
strike.
now,
it's
possible
to
come
with
different
result.
if
you
want
to
be
whether
on
--
follow
cutler-hammer,
you
would
say
this,
“now,
use
two
hypothetical
cases.”
supposing
--
well,
let's
say
the
contract
provides,
a
man
doesn't
come
to
work
a
long
time
or
if
a
man
comes
to
work
when
he's
required
to
report
and
there's
no
work
for
him,
he
is
entitled
to
four
hours
reporting
pay,
common
provision.
suppose
a
man
reports
under
those
circumstances,
he
is
given
to
four
hours
pay
and
files
a
grievance
saying,
“well,
i
think,
that
really
means
i'm
entitled
to
six
and
they'll
making
as
absurd
the
grievance
as
i
can,
frivolous
if
you
want
to,
baseless.”
the
union
says,
“we
want
to
arbitrate
that
grievance,”
and
the
court
says,
“well,
this
is
preposterous,
four
means
four
not
six.”
the
cutler-hammer
doctrine,
say
in
those
cases,
you
don't
arbitrate.
the
employer
is
clearly
right.
the
grievance
is
bad,
there's
no
doubtful
question.
but
what
would
happen
given
the
same
clause,
the
same
kind
of
question,
the
employer
paid
them
two
hours
pay
and
said
four
means
two.
what
can
the
union
do?
well
obviously,
you
can
file
a
grievance
but
the
question
isn't
arbitrable?
this
is
what
grievance
--
it
clearly
ought
to
be
granted.
now,
there
are
a
lot
of
union
people
who
will
say,
“we
don't
arbitrate
that
kind
of
grievance.
we
shut
it
down.”
i
have
always
advised
them
that
you
have
a
grievance
in
arbitration
provision
and
that
says
every
question
of
interpretation
and
application
if
it's
in
good
faith
and
not
just
a
way
of
avoiding
these
people.
if
it's
in
good
faith,
no
matter
how
clear
it
maybe
to
you,
if
the
grievance
is
a
good
grievance,
goes
to
the
grievance
of
arbitration
procedure.
what
if
you
want
to
follow
cutler-hammer
and
says
--
then
you
have
to
do
it
both
sides.
only
doubtful
questions
to
go
to
arbitration,
all
the
questions
which
are
not
doubtful
can
be
resolved
apart
from
the
arbitration
procedure,
i.e.
if
the
grievance
is
clearly
bad.
you
don't
arbitrate
it
if
the
grievance
is
clearly
good,
the
union
can
strike
and
you
can
resolve
that
question
when
this
employer
sues
the
union
for
damages.
and
actually
there
have
been
such
cases,
not
in
the
cutler-hammer
context
where
the
courts
never
seemed
to
follow
cutler-hammer
there
but
there
have
been
cases
were
employers
have
sued
unions
for
breach
of
a
contract
agreement
not
to
strike.
the
union's
defense
has
been
“we
are
striking
about
something
that
wasn't
arbitrable.”
because
not
all
those
strike
arbitration
provisions
are
all
inclusive.
parties
can
agree,
such
a
question
is
not
arbitrable.
the
other
workers
who
do
that.
the
fourth
contract
in
general
motors,
the
critical
question
as
to
the
speed
of
the
line,
how
fast
do
you
have
to
work?
one
of
the
critical
question,
the
parties
don't
trust
themselves
to
contract
about
and
don't
trust
arbitrators
to
decide.
and
they
say,
“this
is
not
arbitrable.”
there
shall
no
be
grievance
about
it.
mr.
david
e.
feller
but
you
can
strike.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
many
of
the
strikers
taking
place
to
--
to
things
who
--
people
in
the
same
union
sometimes
regarded
as
trivial.
but
deciding
from
a
judicial
bench
or
even
from
a
lawyer's
offices
to
whether
a
grievance
is
a
substantial
grievance
which
will
cause
a
strike
and
something
which
is
very
hard
to
do
in
the
realities
of
industrial
relations.
so,
i
conclude
then,
a
very
simple
that
where
an
agreement
contains
a
broad
no-strike
clause
and
a
broad
arbitration
provision,
that's
saying
that
all
questions
of
interpretation
and
application
agreement
should
be
submitted
to
arbitrators.
this
contract
does.
then
all
that
the
court
should
do
determining
whether
to
order
arbitration
is
to
find,
one,
whether
the
union
makes
a
claim
that
the
employer
has
violated
the
agreement.
doesn't
have
to
look
to
see
whether
it's
a
good
claim
or
a
bad
claim
because
if
the
union
has
made
such
a
claim
and
the
employer
denies
that
he
has
violated
the
agreement,
then
there
is
a
question
of
the
interpretation
and
application
of
that
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
my
--
my
case
i
said
they
have
agreed
that
all
questions
as
to
interpretation
and
application
shall
be
subject
to
arbitration.
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes.but
the
--
that
is
correct.
now,
application
although
i'm
making
the
further
statement
that
wherever
the
union
says,
view
in
employer
in
dealing
with
this
employee,
you
did
not
comport
with
the
agree
--
the
provisions
of
the
agreement.
you
did
not
fulfill
your
obligation
to
that
employer.
that's
how
grievances
arise.
madison
always
acts.
they
promote
fire
pay
discharge
and
the
union
grievance,
that's
the
way
the
system
of
industrial
government
operates.
now,
when
the
union
says
grievance
and
says,
“you
have
not
complied
with
your
obligations
under
the
contract.”
if
the
employer
refuses
to
arbitrate,
the
court
should
direct
the
arbitration
because
that
case
necessarily
presents
a
question
of
interpretation
and
application
of
the
contract.
now,
you
can
have
grievances
that
aren't
that
and
you
do
have
them
all
the
time.
you
file
the
grievance
saying,
“we're
working
too
hard.
we
need
a
rest
period.”
well,
that's
a
common
kind
of
grievance.
now,
it
can
have
two
kinds
of
grievances,
can
follow
that.
one,
you
may
have
a
safety
and
health
provision
of
the
contract
and
you're
saying
therefore,
the
company
has
violated
the
safety
and
health
provision.
it's
unhealthy.
it's
unsafe.
that
would
be
a
question
of
interpretation
and
application
agreement.
but
usually,
you
don't
have
that
kind
of
provision.
and
what
you're
simply
saying
is,
“it's
unfair.
it's
unjust.
the
company
ought
to
give
us
rest
periods
or
onto
us,
we
had
an
issue
on
the
last
steel
negotiations
one
of
the
issues
which
occupy
a
great
deal
of
time,
the
united
states
steel
negotiation
with
the
questionable
toilets
at
the
ellwood
city
plant.
they
were
dirty,
they
didn't
flush
properly
and
it
took
too
far
to
get
to
them.
it's
the
kind
of
thing
that
people
discuss
in
collective
bargaining
and
in
which
grievances
are
filed
about
which
do
not
involve
any
claim
that
the
employer
had
an
obligation,
implicit
or
express
in
the
agreement
which
he
did
not
comply.
when
you
make
that
kind
of
a
claim,
then
in
the
usual
kind
of
clause,
it
is
not
an
arbitrable
question.
normally,
the
--
the
union
doesn't
answer
to
the
arbitrator
because
there's
nothing
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide.
you
don't
go
to
an
arbitrator
in
grievance
arbitration
and
say,
“we
think
it's
fair
that
you
do
this.”
unless
there
are
some
clause
which
gives
the
arbitrator
discretion
to
decide
what's
there
which
is
obviously
in
the
case
of
this
charge.
no
agreement
that
i
know
of
list
specifically
all
the
causes
for
discharge.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
saw
the
picture
in
the
paper,
but
the
--
they
just
cause
the
--
any
place
where
the
arbitrator
has
discretion.
and
under
that
contract,
i'd
like
to
know
how
he
showed
--
but
what
i
am
saying
to
you
mr.
justice
whittaker,
and
in
conclusion,
that
if
the
union
says
that
the
company
has
an
obligation
to
do
something
or
it
has
violated
its
obligations
by
doing
something
under
the
contract,
the
employer
denies
it,
there
is
an
issue
as
to
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement
and
the
issue
is
arbitrable.
and
that's
all.
thank
you.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
i
can
just
to
add
one
word.
i
think
the
issue
is
now
been
posed
very
clearly
by
mr.
carriger.
the
issue
is
whether
the
plaintiffs
who
comes
in
and
ask
that
the
court
enforce
the
agreement
to
arbitrator,
has
to
introduce
evidence
in
the
court
dealing
not
with
the
promise
to
arbitrate,
but
with
the
substantive
provision
which
he
wants
determined
in
arbitration.
has
to
make
a
kind
of
prima
facie
case,
as
it
were
which
in
(inaudible)
the
second
circuit
did
indicate
citing
some
admiralty
arbitrations.
the
case
whose
name
always
remembers
(inaudible)
because
his
name,
that's
citing
a
whole
bunch
of
commercial
arbitration
precedents
saying
you
have
to
go
in
and
show
some
evidence
of
your
claim
on
the
merits.
and
we
think
plainly
that
that's
wrong,
let's
cut
their
hammer.
we
think
that's
wrong.
the
court
is
enforcing
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
not
the
seniority
provision,
not
the
discharge
provisions.
we
have
to
bring
in
and
show
that
there
is
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
that
the
agreement
hasn't
been
complied
with,
that
we
did
show
and
that's
all
i
think
we
are
required
to
show.
thank
