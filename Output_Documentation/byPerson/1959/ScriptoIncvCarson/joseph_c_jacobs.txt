mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant
has
fairly
stated
the
facts
in
this
case.
i
think
as
they
were
stipulated
to
--
in
the
court
below.
we
would
like
to
challenge
certain
conclusions
of
law
which
were
reached
as
a
result
of
some
of
those
facts.
the
case
which
is
present
and
before
the
court
comes
somewhere
between
the
miller
bros.
case
and
the
general
trading
case,
both
of
which
were
subject
to
extensive
study
in
both
of
the
briefs
and
which
the
appellant
has
referred
to
in
his
argument.
the
court
well
recalls
that
the
--
the
distinction
between
the
miller
bros.
case
and
the
general
trading
case.
now,
the
only
distinction
between
the
case
which
is
presently
before
the
court
and
the
general
trading
case
is
the
fact
that
the
agents,
the
solicitors,
the
salesmen
in
florida
in
the
case
presently
before
the
court
are
not
the
employees
of
the
--
of
the
merchant,
the
georgia
merchant
who
is
selling
his
products
in
florida.
the
question
necessarily
comes
as
to
whether
or
not
the
contact
is
--
is
completed
which
would
give
florida
jurisdiction
to
require
this
person
to
collect
the
tax
and
to
remit.
this
is
the
only
material
fact
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case
which
was
not
before
the
court
in
the
general
trading
case.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
i
will
right
now,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
[laughs]
thank
you,
sir.
the
--
there
was
no
contact
in
the
miller
bros.
case,
as
i
recall
the
facts
in
the
miller
bros.
case,
the
--
there
--
let
me
see,
the
states
were
delaware
and
maryland.
there
was
a
delaware
corporation
as
i
recall
it,
in
which
did
business
in
delaware
and
who
sold
to
certain
maryland
citizens.
the
only
contact
with
the
maryland
citizens
were
--
was
as
a
result
of
certain
advertisement
in
newspapers
and
radio
and
(inaudible)
direct
mail
advertising.
the
persons
then
came
across
the
state
line,
purchased
the
product
and
the
product
was
presumably,
ultimately
consumed
or
used
in
the
state
of
residence
of
the
purchaser.
now,
in
the
case
that
we
have
before
us
today,
we
have
10
jobbers
who
admittedly
are
employed
by
other
people
or
who
are
--
who
are
out
presumably
selling.
and
we
call
the
court's
attention
likewise
to
the
contract
of
agreement,
the
memorandum
of
agreement
between
these
jobbers
and
the
scripto
inc.
operating
through
its
adgif
division.
and
what
does
provide?
it
provides
that
these
people
have
a
--
area
in
which
they
are
the
exclusive
salesmen
for
scripto
inc.
or
adgif,
whatever
you
want
to
call
them,
it's
--
it
is
the
alter
ego,
one
or
the
other.
these
are
not
separate
corporations
as
it
had
been
pointed
out.
as
long
as
he
places
one
order
every
six
--
every
60
days,
he
--
he
remains
an
active
salesman
of
the
scripto
inc.
you
will
note
the
difference
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
i
don't
know,
sir.
but
i
believe
that
it
would.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
it
would
be
my
view
that
it
would.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
that
would
be
my
view.
yes,
sir.
because
as
i
recall,
the
california
case
wasn't
--
there
was
only
two
solicitors
or
salesmen
in
--
in
that
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
but
--
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
i
believe
it
was
the
west
publishing
or
there
was
another
california
case.
i
believe
it
was
the
west
case
where
there
was
two.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
i
believe
it
would
be
my
view
that
they
could
put
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
i'm
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
i
believe
it
would
be
my
view
that
--
that
he
would
come
within
--
come
within
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
although
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
case
as
to
that.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
that's
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
the
same
thing
is
do
employ.
yes,
sir,
6%.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
my
--
the
last
time
i
saw
it,
it
was
six.
i
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
i
will
not
vouch
for
the
percentage.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
but
they
do
receive
a
fee
for
the
collection
of
the
tax.
yes,
sir,
a
percentage
of
it.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
they
--
they
do
--
they
do
--
they
--
and
also
an
exemption
if
they
can
show
that
the
tax
has
been
paid
in
any
other
state
in
the
other
general
provisions
of
the
sales
and
use
tax.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
mr.
justice
whittaker,
if
you
say
so,
it's
--
i
--
i
believe
you'd
--
that's
not
my
recollection
of
the
facts
in
the
case.
my
recollection
of
the
facts
in
the
case
was
that
they
--
well,
the
deliveries
were
by
--
by
interstate
commerce
by
giving
it
to
an
interstate
commerce
carrier.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
i
read
it
this
morning,
that's
not
my
recollection.
[laughter]
may
it
please
the
court,
we
would
desire
to
go
further
in
this
distinction
which
we
want
to
take
issue
with
the
appellant
as
to
this
one
general
salesman
which
scripto
has
in
jacksonville,
florida.
now,
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
these
10
jobbers,
independent
commissioners
or
commissioned
merchants
were
sufficient
to
make
contacts
which
would
be
sufficient
to
meet
the
requirement
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution.
however,
we
certainly
say
and
we
do
--
we
do
not
say
to
this
court
that
--
that
it
should
ignore
the
fact
that
they
had
a
one
man
who
was
stationed
in
jacksonville
who
was
working
for
scripto
inc.,
which
is
the
corporation
of
which
adgif
is
nothing
more
than
a
department.
and
this
man
was
--
although
he
was
not
and
we
stipulated
that
this
man
did
not
make
--
can't
make
a
--
accept
orders
for
the
advertisement
specialties
which
are
--
which
are
handled
by
adgif.
he
did
accept
orders
and
--
and
made
sales
for
scripto
inc.
and
we
take
the
position
that
if
the
florida
court
had
jurisdiction,
it
must
have
jurisdiction
of
scripto
inc.,
the
cooperate
--
the
corporation,
not
over
any
department
or
any
part
or
any
individual,
because
the
jurisdiction
is
of
the
corporation.
the
jurisdiction
is
certainly
not
of
the
individual
transaction
or
any
part
of
the
transaction.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
i
do.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
no,
sir.
our
response
to
that
argument
is
that
there
is
no
undue
--
there
is
no
direct
burden,
there
is
no
--
no
direct
burden
at
all,
because
the
--
the
florida
sales
tax
is
a
1949
act.
it's
a
sales
and
use
tax.
the
court
is
well
acquainted
with
the
history
of
the
use
tax,
how
that
--
the
sales
tax
was
--
was
initially
passed
and
it
became
obvious
immediately
that
a
burden
was
placed
upon
the
merchant
in
the
--
in
the
state
that
had
a
tax
in
competing
with
the
merchant
across
the
state
line
in
the
state
that
had
no
tax,
because
here
is
the
merchant
in
the
taxing
state
who
--
who
sells
a
--
the
--
the
gentleman
the
product
and
he
charges
him
with
3%
sales
tax
for
the
product.
but,
by
the
independent
jobber
who
can
walk
right
by
--
right
--
right
behind
this
salesman
and
sell
the
same
product
to
the
same
person
for
the
same
use
and
say,
“no,
i
don't
have
to
collect
the
tax,
because
i
am
across
the
state
line.”
obviously,
that
--
that
was
the
purpose
that
--
that
brought
into
existence,
the
use
tax.
the
use
tax
is
a
complement
to
the
--
to
the
sales
tax.
it
is
to
protect
the
--
the
merchant
in
the
state
that
has
the
tax
against
the
merchant
across
the
state
line
where
there
is
no
tax
and
that
is
the
very
basis.
this
case
puts
in
crystal
clear
the
very
basis
for
the
use
tax.
let's
--
let's
presume
the
appellant
to
be
correct.let's
presume
that
he
is
--
he
is
entirely
correct.
scripto
inc.
through
adgif
division
or
department
goes
to
a
florida
citizen
and
he
sells
him
100
pens
with
his
name
on
them
to
give
to
the
public.
he
charges
him
a
price
for
it.
he
says,
“what
do
i
have
to
--
what
about
the
sales
tax?
no.
there
is
no
sale
or
use
tax
on
this
product
because
i
am
an
independent
jobber
for
a
georgia
concern.”
now,
the
florida
citizen
walks
right
behind
him,
makes
the
same
sale
to
the
same
person,
the
same
transaction
exactly
and
we
tell
them
--
him
that
it
is
a
crime
unless
he
collects
3%
and
remits
that
3%
to
the
state
of
florida,
excluding
what
he
receives
for
the
service.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
there
is
--
there
is
an
effort
made
consistent
with
--
with
economies.
we
are
not
able
to
--
that
would
put
an
--
an
unreasonable
and
impossible
administrative
burden
on
a
state
to
go
to
the
each
purchaser
and
--
and
collect
the
tax
from
them.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
it's
the
only
way
to
do
it,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
administrative
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
sir?
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
not
in
the
case
of
adgif
here,
because
you
see,
these
jobbers
and
this
is
another
point,
these
jobbers
as
long
as
they
remain
active,
as
long
as
they
send
one
sale
in
every
two
months,
then
--
then,
although
these
people
may
--
they
may
directly
order,
reorder
or
order
new
products
from
the
company
and
he
still
gets
his
fee.
he
gets
his
percentage
as
long
as
he
remains
active.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
oh,
no,
sir.
that
is
collected
in
georgia
and
--
and
the
jobbers'
commission
comes
from
georgia.
now,
we
say
again,
another
point
here,
how
crystal
clear
and
how
easy
it
would
be
if
we
say
that
because
he's
an
independent
jobber,
he
can
now
--
he
--
he
is
now
free
of
the
tax.
look
how
simple
it
would
be
to
draw
a
contract,
just
exactly
and
i'm
glad
mr.
justice
brennan
brought
up
the
question
of
this
statute
which
was
passed
recently
relating
to
that
subject.
as
the
court
is
well
familiar,
that
statute
relates
purely
to
income
taxes
and
we,
in
florida,
do
not
have
any
income
tax.
i'd
like
that
clearly
indirect,
but
this
--
and
that's
all
that
the
statute
related
to,
was
to
income
taxes.
it
did
as
pointed
out.
and
the
appellant's
argument
defined
certain
terms.
but
i'd
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
--
and
i'm
a
little
bit
concerned
because
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
at
the
case
just
prior
to
this
one
that
they
would
not
take
judicial
notice,
but
i
refer
to
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
you
did
in
a
--
take
judicial
notice
of
certain
document,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
well,
in
senate
report
number
658,
relating
to
this
bill
on
the
income
tax,
the
committee
admitted
that
the
bill
rose
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
northwestern
states
portland
cement
company
versus
state
of
minnesota
and
williams
versus
stockham,
1959
cases.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
sir?
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
thank
you,
sir.
i
can't
read
them
right.
the
committee
specifically
referred
to
this
language
of
the
court,
“we
conclude
that
net
income
from
the
interstate
--
intrastate
operation
of
--
intrastate
operation
of
a
foreign
corporation
maybe
subjected
to
state
taxation
providing
the
levy
is
not
discriminatory
and
properly
apportional
--
apportionable
to
local
activities
within
the
taxing
state,
forming
sufficient
nexus
to
support
the
same.”
then,
the
--
the
committee
report
went
on
to
say
that
there
was
some
confusion
as
to
what
this
language
meant
and
the
statute
came
from
that
confusion.
we
take
the
position
that
the
court
varies
--
very
fairly
and
very
--
very
clearly
stated
the
law
in
those
two
cases.
and
that
the
statute
was
written
with
the
obvious
intent
of
--
of
changing
that
--
those
decisions.
so,
we
now
say
that
the
general
law
is
exactly
as
it
was,
except
as
it
relates
to
the
income
taxes
and
this
--
and
the
congress,
the
united
states
took
it
upon
itself
to
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
as
i
understand
it,
it
would
not.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
it
would
go
directly
to
scripto.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
i
would
levy
a
use
tax
on
it,
but
for
the
--
the
simple
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
oh
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
oh,
of
course.
that
would
come
within
the
miller
case,
if
--
if
there
is
no
jobber,
if
there
is
no
operation
and
if
he
just
sends
an
order,
he
can
send
an
order
anyway
he
wants
to.
and
of
course,
there
would
be
no
tax
on
it.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
but
i
say
the
miller
case
would
be
authority
for
it,
if
not
charging
the
tax
in
the
--
in
the
hypothetical
case
which
--
which
you
brought
up.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
there
was
one
full-time
employee
of
scripto.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
none.
in
relation
to
--
you
understand
that
the
scripto
inc.
is
a
pen
company.
they
make
mechanical
pens
and
they
sell
them,
irrelatively
inexpensive
from
$25
to
about
a
$1.50
each.
now,
the
--
not
a
separate
corporation,
but
a
division
of
the
corporation
is
the
adgif
company
who
makes
a
somewhat
cheaper
pen,
but
it
--
they
do
not
sell
that
on
retail.
that
one
is
sold
--
i
mean,
the
adgif
sells
these
as
an
advertising
gimmick,
put
your
name
or
your
company's
name
on
it.
now,
the
scripto
sales
market
is
an
employee
of
scripto
inc.
we
stipulated
that
he
made
no
sales
of
adgif
products,
but
we
do
say
that
he
was
a
representative
of
scripto
that
he
makes
sale,
that
--
that
if
--
that
the
jurisdictional
contact
is
of
the
corporation,
scripto
inc.
and
not
of
the
individual
nor
of
the
individual
transaction.
and
we
say
that
if
that
gave
us
jurisdiction
over
scripto
inc.,
it
gave
us
the
jurisdiction
over
every
department
of
scripto
inc.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
sir?
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
as
to
--
yes,
sir,
as
to
that
--
as
to
that
part.
now,
the
florida
supreme
court
went
on
to
hold
that
these
10
jobbers,
that
in
the
view
of
the
court,
that
those
10
jobbers
gave
the
jurisdictional
contact
sufficient.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
i
--
i
--
no
--
no,
sir.
i
think
that
we
can
rely
on
the
court's
decision
as
written,
but
i
think
that
that
--
that
had
that
not
been
true
that
the
--
that
the
one
full-time
employee
gave
the
--
gave
the
florida
court
jurisdiction
to
require
them
to
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
sir?
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
he's
a
full-time
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
general
salesman.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
sir?
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
of
the
company,
yes,
sir.
other
product
of
the
same
company
and
if
we
have
jurisdiction
over
the
company,
we
have
jurisdiction
over
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
all
of
the
companies.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
no,
sir.
he
sold
--
but
i'm
convinced
that
he
sold
products
as
--
as
to
which
our
sales
tax
apply
which
is
all
a
part
of
one
statute
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
the
sales
of
use
tax.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
this
one
salesman?
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
was
--
as
a
result
of
the
10
jobbers
to
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
because
he
sold
no
--
no
products
that
were
subject
to
the
use
tax
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
with
which
we
were
familiar.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
not
--
none
that
--
none
that
i
know
of,
sir.
and
the
record
would
not
--
does
not
reveal
it.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
we
can
presume
not
to.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
you
--
you
will
recall
that
there
was
another
element
of
the
case
before
the
florida
supreme
court,
something
to
do
with
that.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
but
that
was
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
that
is
not
the
subject.
no,
sir.
it's
not
here.
it's
not
subject
to
appear.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
i
say
that
because
of
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
that
is
eminently
correct,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
sir?
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
that's
exactly
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
that
the
requirements
of
due
process
are
met.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
you
mean
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
i
believe
the
requirement
would
be
on
them
to
pay
it,
if
it
was
not
--
if
it
was
not
collected
previously.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
possibly,
we
do.
we
charge
him
a
$1
registration
fee,
every
dealer
who
qualifies.
the
--
the
requirement
is
that
he
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
i
believe
this
court
has
found
on
that
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
(voice
overlap)
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
none
--
none
that
the
record
reveals
nor
that
i
am
aware
of,
no,
sir.
and
as
far
as
i'm
--
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
he
had
nothing.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
as
far
as
i
know,
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
and
may
i
--
may
i
close
with
these
--
these
remarks
that
there
is
no
requirement
placed
on
scripto
through
the
use
tax
that
there
is
not
in
a
corresponding
requirement
placed
on
florida
merchant
under
the
sales
tax,
this
is
one
bill.
the
sales
and
use
tax
passed
in
about
the
same
session
of
the
legislature,
then
administered
by
the
same
man.
and
if,
the
--
in
the
administration
of
that
act
as
has
been
suggested
by
the
appellant,
some
unreasonable
or
some
unrelated
benefit
was
given
to
the
local
citizen
that
was
not
given
to
the
foreign
--
foreign
citizen
of
the
foreign
merchant.
i
know
that
this
court
would
strike
that
down
and
there
is
none
to
my
knowledge.
we
feel
that
the
operation
of
the
sales
and
use
tax
is
a
complementary
tax
and
that
--
that
there
is
no
unreasonable,
there
is
no
distinction
made.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
i
was
most
concerned
about
the
statement
that
was
made
that
that
related
only
to
out-of-state
merchants,
if
that
is
--
i'm
not
aware
of
any
opinion
to
that
effect.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
--
that
it
would
be
construed
that
way
and
if
it
was,
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
how
do
we
enforce
this
--
the
use
tax
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
act?
we
would
--
we
would
periodically
audit
the
books
of
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
wherever
we
could
get
them.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
our
order
to
the
statute
requires
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
to
do
so.
and
if
they
(inaudible)
they
don't,
their
--
their
permit
to
do
business
and
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
they
have
--
they
have
to
--
to
qualify
under
the
sales
tax
act
by
paying
a
$1
fee
and
making
an
application.
and
to
--
and
--
and
they
must
continue
to
be
qualified
by
--
by
collecting
tax.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
we
--
we
get
to
see
them
because
the
statute
requires
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
it
can't
control
people
in
florida
either,
if
they
don't
want
to
abide
by
the
law.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
we
feel
that
we
would
be
entitled
under
the
act
to
get
an
injunction
to
enjoin
them
from
doing
business
in
the
state
of
florida,
unless
they
pay
the
--
their
--
their
just
taxes.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
no,
sir.
not
at
all.
not
at
all,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
no,
sir.
they
--
they
must
--
they
must
--
the
statute
provides
that
--
i
don't
have
a
performer,
the
statute
provides
that
the
person
must
make
and
must
become
qualified
and
--
and
there
is
no
--
there's
--
there's
no
--
all
the
qualification
consist
of
is
letting
them
know
who
--
who
runs
the
business
and
sending
a
dollar.
that's
what
the
statute
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
but
if
there
is
a
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes.
if
there
is
a
jurisdictional
contact
that
--
that
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
due
process
clause,
then
we
can
--
then
we
can
require
them
to
--
to
collect
the
--
collect
the
use
tax
and
make
an
application
and
--
and
make
a
don't
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
remit.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
we
would
seek
to
--
to
enjoin
them
from
continuing
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
no,
sir.
not
in
so
far
as
they
--
as
--
as
far
as
they
are
doing
a
business
consistent
with
the
miller
case.
but
suppose
they're
doing
a
business
with
--
consistent
with
the
general
trading
case
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
--
how
would
we
operate?
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
no,
sir.
we
would
get
an
injunction
in
florida
where
they
--
or
where
we
were
--
we
find
that
--
that
they
have
been
doing
business
to
keep
them
from
doing
business.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
no,
sir.
that
--
no,
sir.
that
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
(voice
overlap)
from
coming
and
soliciting
and
taking
sales
within
--
within
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
but
we're
--
we're
presuming
--
we
--
we
--
i
believe
that
we
are
--
we
are
presuming
that
--
that
the
facts
related
would
come
within
the
miller
case.
now,
i
am
presuming
the
facts
would
come
within
the
general
trading
case
where
--
where
there
is
jurisdictional
contact,
where
the
state
--
where
--
where
the
taxing
state
does
have
the
authority
to
require
the
out-of-state
merchant
to
collect
the
tax
and
to
remit.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
no,
sir.
not
at
all.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
because
there
is
no
way
to
--
to
prove
it
unless
we
can
see
the
books
of
the
company.
we
have
no
--
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir
and
i
presume
we
would.
i
--
i'm
sorry,
i
think
i've
led
the
court
of
appeal
on
this
injunction
speaking
about
something
i
had
--
knew
little
about.
mr.
joseph
c.
jacobs
yes,
sir.
i
believe
we
will.
thank
you
for
that.
