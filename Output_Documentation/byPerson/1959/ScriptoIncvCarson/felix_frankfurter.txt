does
the
--
does
the
burden
of
the
imposition
permanently
rests
with
scripto?
i
mean,
you
say
--
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
this
makes
scripto
a
tax
collector
for
--
well,
does
it
merely
--
is
it
merely
using
scripto
as
an
agency
for
collecting
or
does
it
has
paid
us
out
of
its
own
pocket?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
required
to
pass
it
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
cannot
absorb
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
it
maybe
is
a
conduct,
merely
as
a
--
is
that
all
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
does
it
matter
to
scripto
in
dollars
and
cents?
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
the
exact
dollar
and
cents,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
can't
they
--
if
--
if
the
money
finally,
if
the
amount
of
the
use
tax
finally
doesn't
come
out
of
scripto's
treasury,
as
i
understand
from
your
answer
does
not
or
cannot,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
could
it
--
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
amount
of
the
tax
itself.
could
it
not
include
the
cost
of
being
a
tax
collector
and
put
that
onto
the
consumer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
it
--
can
it
add
that
on
to
the
price
of
the
commodity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
burden
is
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
burden
is
not
of
monetary
burden,
but
a
nuisance
burden,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
freeman
and
hewit,
it
was
cash
out
of
their
pocket.
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
only
--
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
nature
of
the
burden
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
--
you
can't
always
compare
his
own
taxes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
--
did
your
--
your
difficulty
with
the
statute
or
the
difficulties,
the
considerations
that
i
indicated
in
my
dissent
in
the
cement
case
which
didn't
find
much
favor
with
this
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
only
thing
that
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
mean
the
result
in
the
cement
case.
the
result
--
there
it
is,
but
i
found
difficulties.
i
thought
that
they
were
advertent
because
you
have
set
up
a
separate
accounting
system.
you
got
to
have
a
separate
staff
and
get
some
period
for
accounting?
that's
what
you're
talking
about
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
just
want
to
know
whether
what's
you're
talking
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
arguing
that
the
constitution
places
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
in
congress
and
not
in
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
says,
“congress
shall
have
power
to
regulate.”
it
doesn't
say
the
states
had
that
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
haley,
have
you
in
mind
the
act
of
congress
passed
last
summer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
under
that
act,
would
the
state
be
--
would
scripto
be
liable
for
its
apportioned
income
tax
in
that
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
i
felt
--
felt
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
concerned
income
tax.
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
well,
that
it
is
not
immediately.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
--
you
will,
in
due
course,
tell
us
why
you
think
you're
in
a
more
favorable
position
than
the
court
found
in
miller
bros.?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suit
yourself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
on
that
--
may
i
ask
whether
under
your
statute
--
supposed
their
concern,
singer
sewing
machine,
a
typewriter,
any
kind
of
national
manufacturing
concern,
raises
its
--
makes
an
arrangement
whereby
only
a
single
--
a
single
dealer
has
given
him
exclusive
opportunity
to
sell
its
commodity
to
a
single
dealer
in
tallahassee
or
in
--
were
not
be
further.
would
that
come
within
that
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
if
a
--
if
a
concerned
select
--
some
few
concerns
to
that
and
say,
“the
land
company
should
--
is
sold
exclusively
by
--
but
wouldn't
all
therefore.
it's
probably
as
a
whatnot.
that
would
make
them
--
that
would
make
sales
by
those
concerns
who
have
the
exclusive
opportunity
of
carrying
a
particular
line
of
goods
for
an
outside
manufacturer,
either
have
nothing
but
ships
in
the
goods.
but
makes
an
arrangement
that
there
--
there
should
be
an
exclusive
opportunity
to
sell
those
goods
or
that
specie
of
goods.
that
would
make
him
a
--
and
that
bring
him
under
your
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
where
that
he
went
out
to
get
orders
for
the
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
supposing
that.
i'm
supposing
merely
an
exclusive
sales
arrangement
between
some
records,
a
record
concerned,
sell
it
exclusively
to
one
shop
rather
than
another
as
the
--
as
the
dealer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
that
particular
goods
--
for
those
particular
goods.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
all
within
the
outside
company
--
justice

--
that
there's
nothing
else
except

they?
justice

your

your
consumers
in
florida

buy
their

justice

and
therefore,
you
could
make

you
have

are

the

on

for
what
that

justice

and

and
in

were
imposed

justice

yes.

why
not?
justice

i

justice
felix

i

justice
felix

well,
that
--
so
that
the
salesman,
this
single
salesman,
the
purpose
--
the
purpose
that
this
single
salesman
served
you
is
that
by
his
presence,
you
say
scripto
is
localized
in
florida.
justice
felix

so
far
as
the
corporation
can
exist.
scripto
existed
in
florida
because
that
salesman
was
there.
is
that
your
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
subject
that
single
salesman
for
scripto
to
a
license
tax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
you
think
you
can
license
a
drummer
who
comes
into
the
state
merely
to
show
examples
and
then
all
the
orders
have
to
be
transmitted
outside
the
state
and
everything
else
is
been
outside
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
this
court
found
on
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
found
in
a
good
word.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
enforce
this
--
how
do
you
enforce
the
acts
against
the
georgia
corporation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where,
in
georgia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
won't
let
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
need
a
permit
to
do
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
get
to
their
books?
how
do
you
get
to
their
books
in
georgia
unless,
if
they
have
strong
notions
of
not
letting
you
see
their
books,
how
do
you
get
to
see
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
your
statute
can't
govern
--
can't
control
people
in
georgia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes,
you
can.
you
can
get
all
sorts
of
court
orders
in
florida,
not
against
people
who
are
not
resident
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

but
suppose
they
don't
want
to
do
that,
can
you
prevent
it
from
getting
orders
from
florida?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
still
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
troubled,
how
you
get
into
georgia,
if
they
don't
come
into
georgia?
they
just
wanted
to
do
interstate
business
and
do
not
--
may
do
not
want
to
do
anything
of
what
they
call
local
business.
they
want
--
this
court
has
said,
“make
them
free
to
get
business
out
of
florida
and
tennessee
and
montana
and
anywhere
else.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
do
you
effectuate
this
tax?
you
say
you
can
order
their
books,
but
they
won't
let
you
order
their
book
unless
you
go
to
apply
at
georgia
court
and
the
georgia
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can't
keep
them
out
because
you
have
no
right
to
exact
any
permission
from
them
to
come
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
florida
injunction
runs
into
georgia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
do
you
get
that,
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you've
said
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
would
get
an
injunction
against
somebody
who
--
isn't
it
worthy
--
the
corporation
for
the
purposes
of
your
law
and
then
you
got
an
injunction
or
a
judgment
against
them,
they
don't
obey,
then
you
go
into
the
other
state
and
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
you
take
an
enforcement
of
it.
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
advertising
solicitation,
wasn't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
make
of
this
drummer
or
salesman
in
--
in
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
scripto
salesman
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
jacobs
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
mr.
jacobs'
argument
is
that
the
corporation
is
there,
figuratively
speaking,
because
they've
got
a
salesman
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
scripto
has
seen
fit
not
to
differentiate
by
way
of
corporations
this
business
for
which
their
job.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
