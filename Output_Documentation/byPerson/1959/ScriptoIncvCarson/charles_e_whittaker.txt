justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
haley,
may
i
ask
you
please,
do
you
concede
that
these
independent
contractors
are
representatives
of
scripto?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
what
about
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
word
“representative”
may
have
several
meanings.
you
don't
concede
that
it
means
agent,
do
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
it,
because
i
had
always
thought
that
an
independent
contractor
was
nobody's
agent
and
represented
no
one
but
himself.
is
that
--
is
that
wrong?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then,
may
the
state
of
florida
by
mere
epithet
fasten
a
relationship
of
representative
or
agent,
if
it
can
do
one,
it
can
do
the
other
upon
the
concern
that
has
no
presence
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
true,
mr.
jacobs,
that
also
in
the
miller
case,
a
delaware
store
actually
made
physical
deliveries
on
occasions
in
maryland
with
their
own
trucks?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
think
you'll
find
that
this
is
so.
i
read
the
case
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
last
night.
that's
my
recollection.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
now,
that
--
you
address
that
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
to
the
due
process
features.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
does
that
have
to
do
with
mr.
haley's
argument
of
undue
burden
on
commerce
in
imposing
a
liability
on
scripto
for
use
taxes
on
goods
sold
in
georgia
and
that
are
delivered
through
as
orders
or
in
filling
orders
obtained
in
for
or
by
independent
contractors?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
may
i
ask
you?
does
your
statute
allow
credit
against
the
liability
imposed
on
the
nonresident
seller
to
the
extent
of
payments
made
by
the
resident?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
you
do
recognize
then
your
right
to
collect
the
sales
tax
from
your
own
citizen?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
any
effort
made
to
do
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
easier
to
make
the
nonresident
seller
collect
for

stockham

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
the
stockham

case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
--
you
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
really?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
is
domesticated
there
just
because
they
have
a
salesman
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
do
you
mean
that
within

shoe,
it
has
--
as
you
contacted

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
due
process?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
--
now,
then,
may
i
ask
you
please,
sir.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
under
your
--
is
there
any
liability
under
your
sales
and
use
tax
law
upon
these
independent
contractors
who
make
these
sales?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
understand?
independent
contractors
involved
here.
they
are
the
persons
who
solicit
as
i
understand
these
--
these
orders.does
your
statute
impose
any
liability
on
them
for
sales
or
use
taxes?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
there,
they
are
present
aren't
they,
as
independent
contractors
operating
in
making
these
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
solicitations.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
to
the
extent
they
pay,
there
could
be
no
liability
on
the
nonresident
seller,
do
they?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
jacobs,
does
that
mean
you're
arguing
that
scripto,
just
atlanta
concern,
must
file
some
kind
of
an
application
and
get
a
little
license
before
it
can
do
interstate
commerce
in
florida?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
--
what
now?
why
not
then?
you
say
the
--
they
--
they
must
get
the
--
file
an
application
and
get
a
license
through.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
said
if
they
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
excuse
me
--
excuse
me.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
you're
in
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you?
would
that
injunction
must
(inaudible)
would
that
injunction
be
against
scripto
from
shipping
goods
from
atlanta
into
florida?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
would
it
--
would
--
would
enjoin
georgia

justice
charles

but
i
understood
it
was

doing
