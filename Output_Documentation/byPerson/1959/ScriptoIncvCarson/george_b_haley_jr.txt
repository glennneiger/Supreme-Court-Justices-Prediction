mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida
which
so
interpreted
the
florida
sales
and
use
tax
act
as
to
require
scripto
incorporated,
the
appellant
here,
to
act
as
a
dealer
and
collect
the
use
tax
of
that
state
on
sales
of
its
adgif
products,
which
is
its
advertising
specialty
line,
to
consumers
in
the
state
of
florida.
having
so
held,
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
then
held
that
the
statute
as
thus
construed
and
applied
did
not
violate
either
the
commerce
clause
or
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
scripto
incorporated
is
a
georgia
corporation
which
has
its
principal
office
and
place
of
business
in
the
city
of
atlanta,
where
its
manufacturing
plant
is
located
also.
scripto
has
not
qualified
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
florida.
it
has
in
the
state
of
florida,
no
office,
warehouse,
distributing
room
or
other
place
of
business.
it
owns
no
property,
no
inventory,
no
stock
of
goods
and
no
bank
account
in
the
state
of
florida.
adgif
company
is
not
a
separate
corporation,
but
is
a
division
of
scripto
incorporated
and
adgif
likewise
has
its
office
in
atlanta.
adgif
devotes
its
activity
to
the
sale
and
distribution
of
mechanical
writing
instruments
with
advertising
material
imprinted
thereon.
there
are
no
employees
of
scripto
and
no
activity
of
scripto
in
the
state
of
florida
which
has
any
relation,
whatever,
to
the
distribution
or
sale
of
the
adgif
line
of
merchandise.
the
sole
activity
in
florida
which
generates
orders
resulting
in
adgif
sales
is
the
activity
of
independent
commission
brokers
who
represent
not
only
the
adgif
division
of
scripto,
but
other
manufacturers
as
well.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
it
is
not
a
separate
corporation.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
those
advertising
specialty
brokers
have
a
brief
form
of
written
contract
with
adgif
company
and
that
contract
is
--
is
in
the
record
in
this
case
at
page
19
of
the
record.
by
the
terms
of
that
contract,
adgif
company
exercises
no
control
whatever
over
these
advertising
specialty
brokers.
the
contract
merely
provides
for
the
rate
of
commission
to
be
paid,
the
brokers,
the
conditions
under
which
the
commission
is
to
be
paid,
is
--
does
not
require
that
they
devote
any
particular
amount
of
their
time
to
the
solicitation
of
orders
to
adgif
sales
or
that
they
not
represent
others
as
well
as
adgif.
it
provides
expressly
that
the
intention
of
the
parties
is
that
the
broker
shall
not
represent
or
hold
himself
out
as
a
representative
of
adgif
company,
that
he
has
no
authority
to
make
any
collections
or
deliveries
or
to
incur
any
debts
for
adgif,
that
his
sole
authority
is
to
solicit
orders
subject
always
to
the
right
of
scripto,
adgif
company
in
atlanta,
to
either
accept
or
reject
those
orders
when
they
are
received.
the
contract
expressly
states
that
no
relationship
of
employer
and
employee
is
intended
that
the
salesman
is
an
independent
contractor.
when
this
advertising
specialty
broker
receives
an
order
and
forwards
--
forwards
it
to
adgif
in
atlanta,
if
adgif,
in
its
discretion,
sees
fit
to
accept
that
order,
the
order
is
consummated
by
delivery
of
the
merchandise
to
an
interstate
carrier
in
atlanta
and
delivery
is
completed
at
that
time,
therefore,
be
atlanta
that
has
expressly
provided
in
the
order
forms
which
is
the
next
exhibit
following
that
contract.
that
title
shall
pass
in
the
city
of
atlanta
when
property
is
delivered
to
the
carrier.
shipment
is
made
directly
to
the
customer
in
florida.
the
advertising
specialty
broker
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
deliveries.
payment
for
the
merchandise
is
made
directly
to
adgif
in
atlanta.
the
broker
is
not
permitted
and
does
not
make
collections.
now,
scripto
in
addition
to
its
adgif
sales,
sells
its
regular
line
of
merchandise
through
wholesalers
throughout
the
country
for
resale.
that
is
the
line
of
merchandise
which
you
see
at
the
--
at
the
corner
drugstore.
now,
those
--
the
distribution
and
sale
of
scripto's
regular
lines
which
i
would
like
to
refer
to
it
here,
is
completely
separate
and
distinct
from
the
distribution
and
sale
of
its
adgif
line.
scripto
does
employ
one
employee
salesman
who
resides
in
the
city
of
jacksonville,
florida
and
whose
sole
authority
and
function
is
to
solicit
orders
and
promote
business
by
these
wholesale
jobbers
for
the
regular
scripto
line.
it
is
a
stipulated
fact
in
this
case
that
adgif
sales
do
not
arise
by
reason
of
any
activity
of
this
employee
salesman
and
that
those
sales
arise
solely
by
reason
of
the
solicitation
activity
of
the
independent
brokers
who
solicit
the
adgif
orders.
that
is
a
--
a
stipulated
fact
and
i
might
mention
that
there
are
no
disputed
facts
actually
in
this
case.
the
case
was
tried
on
--
on
a
stipulated
--
stipulated
facts.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
i
--
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
deciding
that
scripto
was
a
co-dealer,
within
the
meaning
of
section
212.06
(g)
of
the
florida
statute,
said
that,
“it
is
so
only
because
of
this
solicitation
activity
of
these
independent
brokers
and
not
by
reason
of
this
completely
unrelated
and
unconnected
activity
of
the
scripto
employee
salesman.”
it
is
our
position
that
--
that
amounts
to
a
construction
of
the
florida
statute
to
that
effect
by
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
and
that
it
is
binding
on
this
court.
and
that
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
a
state
may
constitutionally
require
an
interstate
seller
who
has
no
place
of
business,
no
employees
within
a
state,
whose
interstate
sales
arise
solely
by
reason
of
solicitation
activity
of
independent
brokers
who
represents
other
sellers
as
well,
whether
such
a
state
under
those
circumstances
may
constitutionally
require
this
out-of-state
seller
to
act
a
tax
collector
for
the
use
tax
arising
out
of
those
sales
to
florida
consumers.
it
is
appellant's
further
contentions
that
this
statute
as
construed
and
applied
in
this
case,
imposes
a
direct
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
now,
we
concede
that
it
is
a
use
tax
which
we're
dealing
with
here,
rather
than
a
sales
tax.
in
other
words,
that
the
incidence
of
the
--
of
the
tax
imposition
is
on
the
florida
residents
who
uses
or
consumes
the
product.
we
concede
that
the
state
of
florida
has
the
constitutional
right
to
tax
used
by
its
citizens
of
tangible
personal
property.
this
court
has
long
ago
decided
that,
but
what
we
challenge
is
the
direct
imposition
upon
scripto
of
the
duty
of
acting
as
a
tax
collector
and
we
submit
that
from
the
florida
statute,
it
is
abundantly
clear
that
this
is
a
burden
which
is
imposed
for
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
business
in
the
state
of
florida.
and
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
in
that
connection
to
section
212.12
of
the
statute
--
on
page
29
of
the
statute
which
is
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief.
the
pages
of
the
appendix
are
separately
numbered
from
the
brief.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
scripto
is
required
as
all
dealers
are
by
the
statute.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
to
pass
the
tax
on
to
the
consumer.
that's
true
whether
it's
a
sales
tax
or
a
use
tax.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
it's
required.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
he
cannot
absorb
it,
cannot
hold
its
--
hold
out
to
the
public
that
he
will
absorb
it.
it's
a
crime
and
to
do
so.
that
applies
to
the
sales
tax
made
by
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
i
think
as
--
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
--
in
miller
bros.,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it's
more
than
just
a
question
of
scripto
being
a
conduit.
it's
requiring
scripto
to
collect
a
tax
which
is
due
by
another.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
and
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
well,
there
are
no
facts
in
this
record
stating
it
in
dollars
and
cents,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
it
means
that
scripto
will
have
to
act
as
tax
collector
for
32
other
states
which
imposed
similar
taxes.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
they
will
have
to
maintain
detailed
book
--
bookkeeping
records
separate
and
apart
for
each
state.
that
those
records
will
have
to
be
made
available
for
inspection
and
audit
by
the
various
revenue
departments
of
those
various
states.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
that's
right,
the
amount
of
the
tax
itself.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
the
amount
of
the
tax
itself.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
question.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
it
can
and
probably
would
as
any
--
anyone
in
business
may
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
--
if
it
--
if
it
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
the
burden
is
a
direct
impediment
on
interstate
commerce
which
this
court
said
in
freeman
against
hewit,
“will
not
be
tolerated
regardless
of
the
fact
that
a
like
burden
is
imposed
on
intrastate
business.”
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
but
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
this
court
has
not
only
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
well,
i'm
sure,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
manufacturer
in
freeman
against
hewit
passed
that
cost
on
to
the
consumer
as
any
manufacture
does
for
the
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
if
you
can
compare
it,
you
--
you
do.
but
let
me
point
out
this
--
what
this
section
212.12
provides
and
--
and
because
it
bears
directly
on
this
question.
it
says,
“taxes
imposed
by
this
chapter
upon
the
privilege
of
the
use,
consumption
or
storage
for
consumption
or
sale
of
tangible
personal
property
shall
be
collected
upon
the
basis
of
an
addition
of
3%
to
the
total
price,
total
sale
price
of
such
article
or
articles
that
are
purchased,
sold
or
leased
at
any
one
time
to
a
customer
or
buyer.”
and
then
this
was
the
part
that
i
want
to
call
particular
attention
of
the
court
to.
“and
the
dealer
or
person
in
charge
herein,
is
required
to
pay
a
privilege
tax
of
3%
on
the
total
of
his
gross
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
and
such
personal
or
dealer
shall
add
3%
to
the
price,
rental
or
admissions
and
collect
the
total
sum
from
the
purchaser
(inaudible)
lessee
or
consumer.”
in
other
words,
the
tax
--
the
imposition
imposed
on
the
dealer
is
expressly
stated
to
be
a
privilege
tax
of
3%
of
the
total
of
his
gross
sales
in
this
section
212.12.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
the
--
the
cement
case
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
the
cement
case
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
--
the
cement
case
is
entirely
a
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
well,
mr.
judge
frankfurter,
i
think
that
this
imposition
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
that
is
one
thing
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
--
but
that
is
not
the
only
ground
for
the
burden.
i
mean
this
court
has
stricken
down
impositions
or
exactions
imposed
by
a
state
rather
than
tax
exactions.
i
mean
a
state
regulatory
measure
maybe
invalid
because
it
imposes
a
direct
imposition
on
interstate
commerce.
but
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
primarily,
until
the
congress
has
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
no,
that's
exactly
the
point
i'm
making.
that
--
that
the
states
here
--
that
this
state
is
by
this
construction
of
its
statute
regulating
and
impeding
interstate
commerce.
even
if
the
court,
however,
should
consider
that
this
is
not
a
direct
imposition
on
interstate
commerce,
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
burden
imposed
by
this
from
tax
collection
duty
here
is
unreasonable
and
that
it
bares
no
relationship
whatever
to
any
privilege
or
benefit
derived
by
scripto
from
the
state
of
florida.
there
is
no
need
for
relationship
whatever
to
any
need
of
the
state
of
florida
to
collect
its
taxes
in
this
manner
and
that
the
imposition
on
the
appellant,
scripto,
is
beyond
all
proportion
to
any
benefit
derived
by
the
state
of
florida
from
collecting
its
taxes
in
this
manner.
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
must
be
some
local
incident,
some
local
activity
however
minute,
from
which
the
obligation
which
the
state
seeks
to
impose
arises.
and
as
a
result
of
which
the
out-of-state
corporation
derives
some
benefit
from
the
state
before
that
state
has
the
power
to
burden
the
interstate
transaction.
for
example,
in
general
trading
company
and
in
the
international
shoe
case,
this
court
found
that
solicitation
of
orders
by
employee
salesman
even
though
a
very
minimum
connection
with
the
state
imposing
the
obligation,
was
nevertheless,
a
sufficient
nexus
or
connection
to
permit
the
state
to
impose
an
obligation
arising
directly
out
of
that
specific
activity
which
the
court
clearly
pointed
out
in
the
international
shoe
case
or
as
the
basis
for
that
decision.
but
here,
there
is
no
activity
of
scripto
in
the
state
of
florida
in
relation
to
its
adgif
sales.
it
is
not
there.
the
only
activity
there
in
relation
to
those
sales
is
the
activity
of
independent
brokers
who
are
themselves,
florida
business,
who
are
themselves
protected
by
and
derived
benefit
from
the
laws
of
the
state
of
florida
and
who
maybe
and
presumably,
are
required
to
discharge
certain
obligations
in
return
for
those
benefits.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
statute
expressly
conflicts
that
a
broker
who
represents
an
out-of-state
merchant
who
refuses
to
register
and
collect
this
tax,
is
himself
made
the
dealer
and
required
to
collect
the
tax.
therefore,
the
state
of
florida
here
under
the
terms
of
its
own
statute
has
a
means
of
collecting
this
tax
from
the
10
independent
advertising
specialty
brokers
who
solicit
the
adgif
orders.
they
are
by
the
terms
of
the
statute,
required
to
register
as
dealers
and
collect
the
tax
and
scripto
does
not
do
so,
so
far
has
not
lost
anything
by
the
interstate
--
by
reason
of
the
interstate
immunity
of
scripto.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
danger
and
in
fact
the
existence
of
possibility
of
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
is
inherent
in
this
statute.
the
various
section
of
the
florida
act
which
defines
the
term
dealer
and
which
was
the
definition
which
the
florida
court
held
to
apply
here,
which
appears
--
appears
at
page
15
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
“at
the
defining
dealer
to
mean
and
include
every
person
who
solicits
business
by
representatives
or
by
the
distribution
of
catalogs
or
other
advertising
matter
and
by
a
reason
thereof,
receives
and
accept
orders
from
consumers.”
and
this
--
as
it
goes
on
to
say.
“and
such
dealers
shall
collect
the
tax
imposed
by
this
chapter
from
the
purchaser
and
no
action
either
in
law
or
in
equity
on
a
sale
or
transaction
as
provided
by
the
terms
of
this
chapter
maybe
held
in
the
state
by
any
such
dealer,
unless
it
would
be
affirmatively
shown
that
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
had
been
fully
complied
with.”
and
that
is
the
only
class
of
dealer
against
whom
the
florida
statute
imposes
this
penalty
of
denial
of
access
to
the
florida
courts,
is
the
dealer
defined
in
that
section
which
is
obviously
out-of-state
dealers,
because
it
as
a
dealer
who
gets
business
by
reason
of
solicitation
of
orders
by
representatives,
catalogs
and
so
forth.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
we
do
not
concede
that,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
in
fact,
that
was
the
point
we
made
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
in
the
circuit
court
of
florida.
our
first
contention
was
that
we
were
not
a
dealer
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute
because
these
brokers
were
not
“representatives.”
but
the
circuit
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
expressly
held
that
they
are
representatives
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
we
do
not
concede
it,
but
we're
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
--
bound
by
that
--
that
finding
here.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
term
that
this
case
need
turn
on
whether
they
are
--
the
term
agent
or
representative
should
be
applied
to
these
brokers.
i
think
the
--
the
crucial
question
is
the
extent
of
their
authority,
the
extent
to
which
they
are
authorized
to
and
do
represent
this
out-of-state
seller.
i
don't
think
the
label
is
of
any
consequence.
for
example
--
for
example,
in
the
case
of
--
in
the
case
of
felt
&
tarrant,
which
the
california
case,
there
we
had
an
agent,
true.
but
it
bore
--
that
agent
bore
no
resemblance
to
their
agent
involved
in
this
case,
if
this
be
an
agent
because
there
was
a
general
agent
who
devoted
his
entire
term
to
the
out-of-state
seller
who
is
required
to
do
so,
who
is
required
to
make
periodic
reports,
who's
expenses
were
reimbursed
by
his
principal,
who
made
local
deliveries.
he
was
the
alter
ego
of
the
out
of
state
--
possible
leave
to
a
greater
extent
than
the
employee
salesman
in
general
trading.
and
yet,
he
was
called
an
agent.
here,
we
--
these
brokers
maybe
agents,
but
only
to
the
limited
extent
of
being
authorized
to
solicit
orders
and
to
that
extent
only.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
well,
that
--
that's
true.
that's
true.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
no,
sir.
not
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
it
can't
deprive
a
party
of
its
constitutional
rights
merely
by
--
by
fixing
a
label
and
this
court
has
--
has
so
recognized
in
numerous
cases.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
no,
fiction
does
not
count
in
--
either
way,
mr.
justice
black.
but
i
submit
that
it
--
that
our
relationship
to
this
independent
broker
is
not
fiction,
is
not
to
be
governed
by
any
label,
but
we're
willing
to
submit
it
on
--
on
the
actual
fact,
the
contents
of
that
relationship,
that
namely,
that
he
represents
other
manufacturers,
he's
not
controlled
by
us
in
anyway.
he
merely
and
his
freewill
and
discretion
solicits
orders
for
our
products
which
are
subject
to
our
acceptance
or
rejection
when
received
in
atlanta.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
no,
under
that
act,
it
would
not.
that
act
expressly
defines
the
term
independent
contractor.
first
of
all,
it
says
that
an
independent
contractor
is
not
a
representative.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
define
independent
contractor
and
it
defines
independent
contractor
to
be
any
person
who
represents
more
than
one
principal.
and
i
think
the
term
principal
is
used
which
of
course
implies
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
i
think
it
is,
at
least
to
this
extent,
mr.
douglas
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
--
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
it's
--
it's
limited
to
income
tax.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
not
directly.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
not
directly.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
it's
at
page
25,
i
believe.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
i
cited
it
and
quoted
only
that
section
which
dealt
with
the
definition
of
independent
contractor
because
it
is
our
contention
that
that
definition
is
merely
declaratory
of
existing
law.
that
this
court,
in
several
cases
involving
jurisdiction
for
purposes
of
service
of
process
and
bringing
of
suits
has
held
that
the
doing
of
business
by
an
independent
contractor
on
behalf
of
an
out-of-state
concern
does
not
constitute
the
doing
of
business
by
the
out-of-state
concern.
and
this
court
has
held
that
that
is
true
even
though
the
--
the
local
business
be
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary,
even
of
the
out-of-state
business.
the
cases
of
bank
of
america
against
whitney
central
national
bank
and
they
are
also
cited
there.
there
are
two
other
cases
also
which
is
cited
at
that
same
place
in
the
brief.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
at
this
time,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
--
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
if
i
could
comment
just
on
the
procedural
questions
as
how
--
as
to
how
this
case
came
up.
they
were
threatening
to
attach
or
garnish
some
of
our
account
receivable
and
we
came
into
court
and
asked
for
an
injunction
against
that
act
as
to
how
they
get
the
information
or
the
figures
on
which
to
base
an
assessment
the
statute
provides.
you
either
furnish
them
in
the
books,
so
they
make
an
assessment
from
the
best
information
available
to
them
and
that
that
assessment
is
presumptively
correct.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
statute
does
require
that
we
apply
to
the
control
of
it
for
a
permit
as
a
dealer
in
the
state
that
we
pay
this
minimum
dollar
registration
fee
that
we
appoint
an
agent
for
service
or
process
upon
us
in
the
state
at
least
as
to
liabilities
arising
under
this
act
that
we
maybe
required
in
the
discretion
of
the
comptroller
to
put
up
a
cash
or
a
collateral
bond
to
secure
the
performance
of
our
obligations
under
this
contract,
under
the
statute
which
is
certainly
a
provision
which
is
more
likely
to
be
administered
by
the
comptroller
to
require
the
state
concerns
to
put
up
such
deposit.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
miller
bros.,
there
was
far
more
involved
than
mere
advertising.
the
furniture
store,
in
that
case,
delivered
67%
of
its
--
its
sales
to
mount
--
maryland
residence
in
its
own
trust.
21%
of
its
total
sales
were
consummated
by
delivery
by
interstate
carrier.
both
of
those
cases
then,
he
would
know
the
destination
of
the
sale,
the
--
that
the
purchaser
was
a
resident
of
maryland.
12%
only
of
its
total
sales
were
consummated
by
delivery
to
the
purchaser
in
the
store.
and
even
in
those
cases,
if
the
purchaser
bought
on
credit
which
the
--
under
the
stipulation
of
facts
was
commonly
done,
the
seller
would
know
the
destination
ultimately
of
the
sale.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
also
that
it's
not
only
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
there
was.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
there
may
have
been
some
limited
mail
order
business.
there
--
there
were
some
ads
mailed
out
to
regular
account
customers.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
and
in
some
cases,
they
may
have
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
--
they
may
have
had
a
coupon
or
something.
i
am
not
familiar
to
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
there
was
advertising
solicitation,
definitely.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
that's
right,
but
they
didn't
always
take
delivery
there.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
you
mean
nippert
--
such
as
the
nippert
case?
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
oh.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
oh.
in
this
case,
it
is
a
stipulated
fact
that
he
has
no
connection
whatever
with
the
adgif
sales.
i
say
that
under
norton
company
against
department
of
revenue,
since
we
have
satisfied
the
burden
of
separating
his
activity
from
the
activity
in
question
--
from
the
sales
in
question,
the
commerce
clause
would
forbid
the
imposition
of
this
duty
with
respect
to
adgif
sales
by
virtue
of
the
activity
of
that
salesman
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
--
which
is
unconnected.
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
this
--
mr.
george
b.
haley,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
this
court
has
never
held
that
mere
solicitation
of
orders
subjects
a
corporation
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
state
for
all
purposes.
in
international
shoe,
this
court
was
careful
to
point
out
that
the
liability
imposed,
that
is
the
state
unemployment
tax,
arose
out
of
that
very
limited
activity,
namely
the
employment
of
employees
in
the
state
(inaudible).
and
that
the
cause
of
action
in
--
in
that
suit
arose
out
of
that
same
activity.
and
therefore,
that
the
state
--
state
have
the
jurisdiction
to
tax
and
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over
the
corporation.
but
this
court
has
not
gone
further
than
that
under
the
due
process
clause.
