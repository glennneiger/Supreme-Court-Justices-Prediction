justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
cite
it
in
your
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
you
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
tell
me
where
--
where
can
i
find
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
catch
all
you
said
about
the
activity
of
the
scripto
employee
in
florida.
you
said
there
was
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
did
he
--
what
were
his
functions
in
relation
to
this
adgif?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
the
way
that
you
use
general
trading?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
what
your
reliance
on
general
trading
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
satisfied
by
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
--
do
you
need
to
rely
on
that
aspect
or
you
--
do
you
think
it's
sufficient
if
they
had
the
salesman
in
florida?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
see,
mr.
jacobs,
i
gather,
the
products
that
he
sold
were
subjected
to
your
sales
tax
collected
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
by
the
retailers
who
sold
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
order
--
those
for
which
he
had
taken
orders
from
them?
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so,
scripto
is
not
involved
in
--
in
the
sales
of
those
pens
and
in
that
sense,
as
far
as
your
tax
law
is
concerned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
will
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
not
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
once
you
get
it,
could
you
--
on
the
same
approach,
why
couldn't
you
get
a
money
judgment
for
the
amount
of
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
well,
i
gather,
your
idea
is
that
they're
in
the
state
for
purposes
of
service
of
process
by
reason
of
the
activities
of
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
solicit,
is
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
and
that
i
take
it,
would
suffice
to
start
to
bring
them
in
the
state
for
the
purposes
of
a
lawsuit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
you
have
discovery
procedures
and
things
like
that
under
your
