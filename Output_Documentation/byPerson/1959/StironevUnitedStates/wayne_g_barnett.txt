mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there
was
evidence
of
direct
shipment
from
the
company
in
west
virginia,
which
happened
to
be
the
sand
company
two
premises
of
the
slag
company
on
which
rider
had
also
put
his
batching
plant.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
says
there's
no
question
here
about
the
fact
of
the
extortion.
we're
concerned
only
with
the
commerce
element.
he's
giving
you
most
of
the
facts
and
i
would
to
like
to
clear
up
a
few
details
particularly
in
the
sand
commerce.
the
relationship
of
the
companies
i
believe
mr.
justice
whittaker
asked
about,
the
sand,
the
slag
company
owns
49%
of
the
sand
company
which
does
the
dredging.
the
other
51%
is
owned
by
the
towing
company,
the
crane
brothers
who
own
the
tugs
that
handle
the
barges
for
both
companies.
it's
true
that
the
sand
was
sold
by
the
dredging
company
to
the
slag
company
and
not
directly
to
rider.
that
was
by
the
relationship
between
those
two
companies,
all
of
their
production
was
taken
by
the
slag
company
and
also
by
the
terms
rider's
lease,
he
was
required
to
take
his
sand
from
the
slag
company.
so
the
slag
company
did
buy
the
sand
from
the
dredging
company
and
paid
for
it
and
then
charged
rider
for
the
sand
that
was
directed
to
go
to
him.
now
the
physical
movements
however
of
the
sand
were
in
most
cases
direct
from
the
barge
from
the
dredge
in
west
virginia
to
rider's
plant
in
pennsylvania.
the
barges
were
taken
upstream
by
the
towing
company,
pass
brady
street
which
was
the
plant
of
the
slag
company
in
pittsburgh
and
then
up
another
25
miles
to
rider's
plant.
sometimes
they
were
docked
temporarily
in
pittsburgh
at
the
brady
street
yard
and
thereafter
picked
up
by
the
towing
company
and
taken
on
upstream
but
they
were
never
unloaded
nad
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
that
the
barges
did
stop
temporarily
at
brady
street
but
that
some
of
them
did.
also,
as
to
the
matter
of
the
shipments
at
the
time
of
the
extortionate
demand,
i
think
it
is
probably
true
that
at
that
time
the
shipments
were
by
rail
that
however
was
because
the
dock
wasn't
finished
at
rider's
plant,
that
was
finished
in
october
of
1951,
the
contract
went
on
until
well
in
the
1954
when
the
extortion
continued.
on
the
steel
commerce,
the
only
fact
that
was
necessary
to
establish
was
that
the
steel
mill
upon
completion
would
sell
its
goods
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
testimony
was
given.
now
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
actually
at
the
time
the
testimony
was
given
the
mill
had
already
been
built
and
in
fact
part
of
the
mill
was
in
operation
before
the
construction
job
was
completed
as
what
was
testified
in
about
the
actual
shipment.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
yes
well
there
is
no
dispute
about
what
this
plant
was
going
to
be.
it
was
to
be
a
hot
strip
rolling
mill
making
sheet
steel
and
i
--
i
dare
say
there's
no
dispute
that
sheet
steel
is
used
primarily
in
the
automobile
industry
than
the
(inaudible)
industry.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
that
is
right
but
there's
no
doubt
of
that
expectations
generally
prevailing.
that
commerce
did
not
then
exist
i
agree.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
essentially
was
the
position
of
the
dissenters
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
did
not
argue
is
that
its
--
it
certainly
is
a
sufficient
effect
to
bring
it
within
the
broad
scope
of
the
commerce
power.
the
dissent
below
relied
primarily
on
fair
labor
standards
act
cases
which
are
limited
to
persons
engaged
in
commerce
and
it
maybe
that
that
the
distinction
between
existing
commerce
and
future
commerce
is
relevant
to
such
a
statute,
we
think
it
is
not
the
statutes
extends
to
--
affecting
in
anyway
or
degree
commerce.
certainly
the
future
effect
is
substantial
even
though
it
is
not
present.
a
delay
in
the
construction
of
the
steel
mill
necessarily
would
cause
a
delay
on
the
beginning
of
the
shipment
of
the
steel
in
interstate
commerce.
and
certainly
i
think
the
national
interest
is
as
great
in
promoting
an
increase
of
production
capacity
as
it
is
in
avoiding
interference
with
current
production.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
i
think
well
perhaps,
the
best
way
to
win
this
case
i
think
is
to
sustain
both
of
the
alternative
instructions.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
yes,
on
the
variance
point.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
well
we
think
indeed
that
it
was
in
fact
a
little
thing,
we
do
--
a
large
part
on
the
variance
issue,
a
large
part
of
petitioner's
argument
is
that
this
were
two
different
crimes
that
he
was
charged
with
the
crime
of
obstructing
sand
commerce
and
was
possibly
convicted
for
the
crime
of
obstructing
steel
commerce.
we're
a
little
surprised
to
hear
the
argument
that
we
might
be
able
to
indict
mr.
stirone
four
or
five
times
if
we
could
show
also
that
the
obstructed
commerce
in
cement.
certainly
in
our
view,
a
single
act
of
extortion
is
but
one
crime.
it
makes
no
difference
how
many
ramifications
on
interstate
commerce
it
may
have.
we
think
therefore
that
the
question
comes
down
to
one
prejudicial
variance
between
the
facts
alleged
and
the
facts
proved.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
variance
between
those.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
include
that
sir,
yes.
now
the
indictment
does
emphasize
we
agree
on
the
sand
commerce
theory
as
a
way
in
which
commerce
was
affected
but
thru
that
channel.
in
terms
of
the
allegations
of
facts,
however,
it
does
specifically
allege
that
the
sand
was
to
be
use
for
concrete
for
the
steel
mill.
so
the
fact
of
the
destination
in
concrete
was
alleged.
the
only
fact
that
was
not
alleged
is
that
the
steel
mill
which
ships
steel
in
interstate
commerce.
now
that
is
a
matter,
i
think,
of
common
knowledge
and
it's
hard
to
see
how
that
might
have
prejudiced
the
defendant
and
the
record
i
think
shows
that
there
was
no
prejudice.
that
testimony
that
steel
have
absolutely
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
was
offered
on
the
second
day
of
the
trial.
the
trial
went
on
for
almost
two
weeks
after
that.
at
no
time
did
the
petitioner
claimed
surprise
or
asked
for
continuance
to
make
a
defense
to
that
testimony
and
i
think
the
reason
was
there
is
no
answer
to
the
test
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
yes
he
did
object
to
the
admissibility
on
grounds
of
materiality.
now
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
we
do
not
sir;
i
think
that
we
should
have.
i
do
not
--
i'm
not
aware
of
the
case.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
your
honor--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
yes--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
indeed
it
is,
we
would
agree
and
if
these
are
two
crimes,
we
would
--
we
would
agree
that
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
in
our
view,
the
scope
of
the
crime
or
the
acts
of
extortion
and
the
impact
on
commerce
must
be
proved,
we
agree.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
that
is
the
jurisdiction
of
fact.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
have
not
checked
that
these
venue
statutes
--
but
are--
it
is
almost
universally
a
state
crime
and
i
think
we
will
be
sure
it
is
pennsylvania
but
i
agree
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
well
i
--
nothing
is
immaterial
and
we
must
prove
it.
i
--
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
think
it
is
essential
to
allege
the
precise
way
in
which
interstate
commerce
is
affected.
we
did
alleged
one
way
i
agree
and
only
to
suggest
the
facts
towards
which
we
--
we
tried
to
show
in
other
briefing.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
i
would
agree
that
that
is
true
if
the
defendant
is
prejudiced,
if
he
has
mislead
in
preparing
his
defense
because
of
that.
but
it
became
clear
in
the
morning
of
the
second
day
of
the
trial
when
we
were
also
relying
on
steel
commerce,
we
introduced
the
evidence
then
and
it
–
it
–
i'll
come
back
in
to
the
question
about
the
objection,
he
did
object
on
grounds
of
materiality
and
in
the
colloquy
that
followed,
he
argues
that
steel
commerce
is
too
remote
and
therefore
it
is
not
material.
now
just
a
materiality
to
recover
the
water
front
and
it--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
probably
it
would
not
accept
in
terms
of
misleading
the
defense.
now
we
have
to
define
the
acts
that
constitute
the
defense
i
agree
and
--
and
i'm
assuming
that
we
alleged
identifying
facts
of
the
acts
of
extortion.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
would
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
facts
upon
which
interstate
commerce
is
based,
yes
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
sir.
and
i
don
not
--
my
point
is
simply
that
any--
any
failure
to
specifically
allege
the
steel
commerce
in
indictment
and
so
it's
going
to
prove
that
variance
did
not
go
to
the
definition
of
the
crime
or
--
or
to
the
--
it
remained
a
single
crime
and
this
was
only
a
different
theory
to
sustain
jurisdiction
and
that
the
variance
did
not
in
anyway
prejudiced
the
defendant.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes--
yes
well
i
agree
he
made
the
objection
that
it
is
too
remote
all
the
way
through
he
has
argued
that
all
the
time.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
no
and
--
and
it
also
comes
in
to
the
trial
early
in
the
stage
that
has
ample
opportunity
to
meet
it
and
he
has
in
fact
all
the
way
through
i
think
had
a
full
opportunity
to
argue
that
issue
of
law
but
i
don't
take
the
variance
from
the
indictments
as
material,
it
did
not
affect
the
opportunity
to
meet
the
evidence.
not
the
legal
arguments.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
let
--
let
me
but
it
is
my
position
to
this
was
not
in
fact
prejudiced
by
the
fact
that
at
no
time
did
he
object.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
right,
sir.
that
is
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
right.
no,
i
think
in
any
words,
there's
a
reason
to
be
construed
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
better.
immaterial,
yes
sir.
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
i
think
not
sir.
i
think
it
says
something
very
different
that
the
effect
is
too
remote.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
returning
to
the
question
of
the
effect
to
the
variance,
i
would
like
to
clarify
the
distinction
i
made
yesterday
in
speaking
of
the
steel
commerce
issue
between
the
scope
of
the
hobbs
act
and
the
scope
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
i
pointed
out
that
the
--
the
dissenters
in
the
lower
court
had
relied
upon
fair
labor
standards
act
cases
in
support
of
the
view
that
only
in
effect
upon
present
commerce
instead
of
future
commerce
would
bring
it
within
the
act.
i
noted
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
cases
are
--
that
these
were
the
so-called
new
construction
doctrine
cases
were
based
upon
an
interpretation
and
application
of
the
specific
standard
of
that
act,
the
application
to
persons
engaged
in
commerce.
and
i
noted
that
whatever
the
validity
of
the
distinction
for
that
purpose,
it
would
not
be
applicable
to
an
act
which
applied
to
activities
affecting
commerce.
now
when
i'm
saying
that,
i
don't
mean
to
imply
the
distinction
is
valid
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
in
fact
the
court
has
at
least
greatly
limited
if
not
over
--
overruled
the
new
construction
doctrine
there.
in
addition
there's
a
second
branch
of
coverage
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
persons
engaged
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce?
and
in
applying
that,
the
court
has
in
fact
applied
it
to
those
engaged
in
operations
which
lead
towards
the
future
production
of
goods.
the
case
to
which
i
refer
is
warren-bradshaw
which
is
decided
in
our
brief
at
--
at
that
page
34.
there
the
act
was
held
applicable
to
an
independent
contractor
engaged
in
preliminary
drilling
of
oil
well.
with
his
equipment
he
could
only
go
down
to
a
stated
depth,
which
would
be
short
of
the
oil
sand
and
the
owner
thereafter
engaged
other
persons
to
bring
in
the
well.
nevertheless,
the
employees
of
the
contractor
doing
the
first
stage
of
drilling
were
held
to
be
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act
because
their
operations
were
necessary
to
the
future
production
of
oil
and
we
think
the
relationship
of
the
construction
of
the
steel
plant's
future
production
of
steel
is
virtually
the
same
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
would
apply
to
rider's
employees.
i
don't
argue
that
case
here,
but
in
relying
on
the
broader
scope
of
the
hobbs
act,
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that
the
--
the
labor
standards
act
would
not
apply.
returning
to
the
variant
point,
i
would
like
--
if
i
may
briefly
to
outline
our
position,
i
think
there
are
really
two
questions.
the
first
is
whether
he
was
in
fact
convicted
for
a
crime
for
which
he
was
not
indicted,
whether
there
are
two
crimes
and
if
that
is
so,
as
i
said
yesterday,
we
would
agree
that
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
in
our
view,
there
is
very
little
question
but
that
the
extortion
was
one
crime
and
the
effect
on
commerce
is
simply
of
the
jurisdictional
element
to
make
--
bring
it
within
the
federal
jurisdiction.
and
in
fact,
we
think
the
indictment
would
not
be
fatally
defective
if
it
did
not
allege
at
all
the
specific
channels
though
which
interstate
commerce
was
affected.
now,
it
is
true
here
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
pointed
out
that
we
did
allege
one
of
the
means
by
which
that
effect
was
felt
and
that
might
in
a
particular
case
work
to
the
prejudice
of
the
--
of
the
defendant
by
misleading
him
as
to
what
he
has
to
prepare
for.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
as
i
said
yesterday,
we
do
allege
the
fact
that
the
concrete
goes
into
the
steel
mill.
but
i
have
to
concede
that
we
do
not
allege
the
fact
that
the
steel
products
would
go
into
interstate
commerce,
and
in
that
sense
we
have
not
alleged
the
full
--
all
of
the
elements
that
we
have
to
prove
on
that.
it
may
be
that
the
act
was
noticed.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
yes,
it
was
sir.
his
plant
was
located
just
a
few
miles
from
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
--
as
i
remember
the
bill
of
particulars
was
directed
--
i
--
i
think
the
questions
were
directed
towards
the
sand
commerce
and
i
think
you're
quite
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
well
it
doesn't
say,
“the
interstate
commerce
it
was
referred
to
in
an
indictment
was
the
sand
commerce.”
i
--
i'm
not
denying
that
and
that
was
--
that
was
true
up
until
the
trial.
i
don't
think
at
anytime
prior
to
the
trial
had
we
specifically
spelled
out
the
steel
theory
and
it
--
it
brought
us
a
--
a
new
theory
introduced
at
that
point
and
in
that
sense
perhaps
is
--
was
error,
but
i
--
i
think
as
rule
50
says
the
court
should
notice
only
a
prejudicial
error.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
was
answered
only
in
terms
of
the
sand
commerce.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
it
was
not
in
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
that
was
not
required
to
be
answered.
i
--
i
--
i'm
wrong
on
that.
it
was
only
question
six
on,
i
think
it
was,
that
were
answered
in
the
bill
of
particulars,
but
that
issue
has
not
been
raised
here.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
of
the
question,
i
think
that's
probably
right
because
i
say
--
that
the
--
we
were
not
directed
to
answer
that.
i
know
--
i
don't
know
why
the
--
the
motion
was
limited
but
that
is
not
an
issue
here.
but
it
--
but
it
is
true
that
--
that
we
do
not
--
specifically
raise
the
steel
theory
until
the
trial,
other
than
alleging
the
fact
of
the
destination
--
the
construction
of
the
steel
mill.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
can
make
it
pertinent
by
the
raw
materials
used
in
steel
production,
but
i
--
i
think
i
have
to
agree
that
that
alluded
to
the
sand
commerce
and
--
and
not
to
the
steel
commerce.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
yes
sir
that
as
--
as
--
we
do
not
think
that
you
have
specify
in
the
indictment.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that
--
whether
the
jurors
are
supposed
to
be
unanimous
on
alternative
instructions
whether
the
--
the
jurors
can
divide
on
--
on
alternative
instructions.
my
guess
would
be
that
that
they
are
to
be
unanimous
on
--
on
the
--
a
single
instruction.
but
in
any
event
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no.
we
have
to
agree
that
we
cannot
tell
from
the
jury's
verdict
which
they
found
and
they
may
have
gone
on
the
steel
issue.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
they
--
they
certainly
could
have
and
i
would
like
to
point
out,
on
the
sand
commerce
the
only
fact
that
had
to
be
established
was
that
these
barge
movements
did
take
place
and
the
barge
movements
were
established
by
unconvertible
records
of
the
dredging
company
and
also
the
slag
company
which
corroborated
with
one
another.
there
was
no
dispute
that
the
sand
movements
did
take
place
and
we
later
argued
that
the
conviction
could
be
sustained
simply
on
the
ground,
but
there
was
no
dispute
about
that
issue.
that's
not
the
point
i'm
arguing
now,
however.
but
--
but
we
think
that
this
is
the
kind
of
variance
which
is
relevant
only
if
it's
prejudicial.
that
--
that
it
is
not
fatal
per
se
and
that
there
certainly
was
no
prejudice
in
meeting
the
proof
that
the
steel
didn't
move
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
we
could
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
that
--
that
is
right.
i
think
the
question
is
what
degree
of
specificity
is
required
in
the
indictment,
whether
it
would
be
sufficient
just
to
allege
that
the
extortion
delayed
and
obstructed
interstate
commerce
without
spelling
out
the
ways
in
which
that
happened,
but
the
court
said
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
i
think
we
do
have
to
allege
that
and
that
is
the
center
on
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
no,
it
is
fatal
only
if
it's
prejudicial.
in
fact
we
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
trial
to
see
if
the
man
was
prejudiced
or
surprised
by
this.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
in
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
think
the
counsel
was
confused.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
i
--
i
--
there
was
a
--
a
colloquy
that
followed
that
and
we
explained
the
reason
we
were
introducing
it
and
he
then
answered
that
he
did
not
think
the
effect
on
steel
commerce
was
substantial
enough
to
satisfy
the
statutory
requirement,
the
legal
argument
that
he's
making
here.
and
that
is
the
only
argument
he
has
ever
made
during
the
whole
course
of
the
trial
in
about
either
sand
commerce
or
steel
commerce.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
well,
i
think
that
if
it
weren't
--
if
it
were
not
essential
to
allege
in
a
specific
way
in
which
interstate
commerce
is
affect
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
then
i
do
not
think
--
see
how
we
resolve
because
we
specify
one
way
except
for
the
possibility
of
the
prejudice
and
as
i
say,
the
evidence
of
the
steel
sales
in
interstate
commerce
was
introduced
in
the
second
day
of
trial,
no
request
for
continuance
was
ever
made
and
no
suggestion
at
all
that
he
was
unable
to
meet
that
evidence
of
the
single
fact
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
i
--
i
would
like
to
deal
with
that.
i
think
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
lawyer
to
call
the
matter
to
the
judge's
attention.
i
think
that's
the
very
purpose
of
rule
30
which
provides
that
that
no
error
may
–
may
be
assigned
to
an
instruction
unless
it
is
specifically
objected
to
for
stated
reasons.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
i
think
this
is
also
with
the
plain
error,
under
rule
52(a)
but
i
--
i
think
this
was
not
done.
