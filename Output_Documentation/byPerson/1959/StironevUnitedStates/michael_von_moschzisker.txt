mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
come
here
from
the
third
circuit
on
certiorari,
extremely
proud
that
chief
judge
biggs
and
circuit
judge
hastie
agreed
with
us
in
this
three
to
two
decision
under
the
hobbs
act.
the
charge
under
the
hobbs
act
was
an
obstruction
or
interference
with
interstate
commerce
by
extortion.
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
of
extortion
is
not
here
today,
but
just
at
the
beginning
i
think
i
should
say
it
was
hotly
contested
and
you
should
know
that
this
alleged
extortionist
was
paid
by
check
and
paid
his
income
tax
on
it.
he's
a
labor
leader
accused
of
having
shaken
down
a
manufacturer
by
threatening
him
with
labor
trouble,
but
none
of
the
labor
leader's
men
worked
for
that
manufacturer,
none
of
the
labor
leader's
men
worked
for
his
suppliers
and
none
of
the
labor
leader's
men
worked
for
his
customers.
as
i
say,
the
defendant
was
indicted
for
obstructing
or
interfering
with
commerce
between
the
states.
our
first
point
of
our
two
points
here
today
is
that
he
was
indicted
for
one
obstruction
of
commerce,
but
the
jury
was
permitted
to
convict
him
of
another
obstruction
of
commerce
for
which
he
was
never
indicted
and
our
second
point
which
is
two-fold,
involve
the
arguments
that
they
admittedly
purely
local
actions
of
the
defendant
had
no
sufficient
effect
upon
commerce
between
the
states.
the
evidence
showed
that
there
was
sand
in
the
bottom
of
the
ohio
river
between
west
virginia
and
ohio
and
a
company
called
the
ducane
sand
company
dredged
or
dug
it
up
and
sold
it
from
out
of
ohio
or
west
virginia
or
both
to
a
company
in
pennsylvania
called
ducane
slag
company.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
majority
of
the
stock
of
one
was
owned
by
the
other
as
it
appears
from
page
68-a
of
the
record
sir,
fifty-one
percent
i
think.
another
company
called
crane
brothers
brought
the
sand
up
the
ohio
river
and
then
up
the
monongahela
river
to
the
brady
street
yard
of
the
ducane
slag
company
in
pittsburgh,
pennsylvania
and
maybe
once
or
twice
to
another
place,
but
in
general
to
the
brady
street
yard
of
ducane
slag
company.
ducane
slag
company,
which
had
a
lot
of
other
customers
also,
sold
some
of
this
sand
to
a
man
named
rider,
who
was
a
manufacturer
of
concrete
and
the
sand
was
sent
over
from
the
brady
street
yard
to
another
property
of
ducane
slag
at
belle
vernon,
pennsylvania
where
rider
did
his
business
of
manufacturing
concrete
on
property
owned
by
ducane
slag.
there
was
no
--
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
a
batching
plant,
yes
sir,
and
--
what
sir?
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
at
belle
vernon
the
last
place
i
named
and
no
interlocking
relationship
in
the
ownership
between
the
rider
supply
company
and
either
of
the
--
or
in
any
other
company
in
this
case.
the
indictment
which
appears
at
page
6-a
or
commences
there
is
one
that
the
government
construes
differently
than
i
do
and
therefore
in
this
case
i
will
take
a
moment
to
say
what's
in
it.
the
indictment,
page
6-a,
charges
a
part
of
the
commerce
between
the
states
was
the
transporting
of
materials
used
in
the
construction
of
a
steel
mill
and
that
this
man
rider
who
is
going
to
turn
out
to
be
the
alleged
victim
of
the
alleged
extortion
had
caused
a
movement
of
such
material
in
commerce
toward
his
concrete
manufacturing
plant
in
pennsylvania
and
that
the
defendant
had
obstructed
commerce
and
the
movement
of
the
aforesaid
material
in
it
by
extorting
$30,000
from
rider.
now
the
defendant,
none
of
whose
men
worked
for
this
man
rider
or
his
suppliers
or
his
customers
said
that
he
had
obtained
a
very
profitable
contract
for
rider
and
that
the
checks
on
which
he
paid
income
tax
was
preventative
commission.
he
will
notice
in
the
indictment
that
stirone,
the
defendant
appellant
was
indicted
for
obstructing
the
receipt
in
interstate
commerce
of
sand
to
be
used
in
manufacturing
concrete
and
that
all
he
was
indicted
for.
so
far
what
some
people
sometimes
call
a
technicality,
that's
all
they
had
any
right
to
try
him
for
it.
the
only
obstruction
of
commerce
they
had
any
right
to
try
him
for,
was
the
obstruction
of
the
receipt
of
sand,
moving
toward
the
concrete
manufacturing
plant.
of
course,
it's
a
technicality
of
great
importance
and
unless
it
continues
to
exist
as
an
important
part
of
our
law,
it
will
just
mean
that
the
baron
shouldn't
have
bothered
to
go
to
any
meeting
in
the
first
place
because
he
could
only
be
tried
for
something
he's
charged
with.
but
over
objection
at
page
51-a,
and
the
objection
was
based
on
the
ground
of
materiality
which
seemed
to
me
would
have
been
exactly
the
right
ground,
other
objection,
the
government
at
the
trial
of
this
indictment
was
allowed
not
only
to
produce
evidence
that
the
receipt
of
sand
that
they're
receiving
him
might
have
been
obstructed
or
interfered
with,
but
was
also
allowed
to
produce
evidence
that
that
sand
was
used
to
make
concrete
and
that
that
concrete
was
supplied
by
this
man,
rider,
to
the
prime
contractor
and
was
used
by
the
prime
contractor
to
help
build
a
steel
mill,
the
pittsburgh
steel
company
and
then
after
the
steel
mill
was
built,
it
shipped
hot
--
it's
called
hot
room
sheet
and
strip
metal
from
pennsylvania
to
the
automotive
industry,
principally
in
michigan.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
51-a
when
the
government
started
to
produce
evidence
sir
with
regard
to
the
steel
mill,
mr.
casey
who
sat
--
who
sits
here
now
said
at
the
top
of
the
page,
â€œi'd
like
to
have
an
objection
to
any
question
relating
to
the
out
of
state
shipments
so
far
as
pittsburgh
steel
is
concerned
and
then
he
said
it
was
kind
of
materiality.
when
the
judge,
trial
judge
short
--
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
yes
sir,
and
perhaps
--
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
and
later
on,
sir,
later
on,
i
believe
and
contended
it
didn't
show
it
anyway
but
at
the
moment
that's
what
i'm
saying.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
when
the
trial
judge
charged
the
jury,
and
this
comes
at
pages
287-a
and
288-a,
the
trial
judge
charged
the
jury
that
they
could
find
if
they
chose
the
necessary
obstruction
or
interference
with
commerce
either
with
regard
to
sand,
what
we've
all
come
to
call
the
receiving
end,
or
in
the
alternative
they
could
find
it
with
regard
to
steel
products
at
the
end
where
they
were
being
shipped
out
after
the
steel
mill
was
finally
erected
out
of
the
concrete
into
which
the
sand
went.
we
say
that
that
was
very
lacking
in
any
element
of
due
process
of
law
and
that
if
anything
went
to
this
jury
at
all,
it
should
only
have
been
an
obstruction
or
interference
with
sand
at
the
receiving
end.
the
government
says
that
the
matter
was
not
made
an
issue
at
the
trial.
i
can
only
answer
that
questioning
if
we
only
know
of
one
way
to
plead
the
general
issue
and
that's
by
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
we've
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
there
--
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
at
the
end
of
the
charge,
mr.
casey,
the
trial
counsel,
made
an
objection
with
regard
to
the
judges
charged
about
the
steel
products
and
i
must
say
he
made
that
objection
in
such
a
general
way
that
i
cannot
pinpoint
it
as
having
included
the
argument
i'm
now
making.
but
his
objection
on
the
grounds
of
immaterial
--
on
the
grounds
of
immateriality
with
the
evidence
offered,
i
think
it
does
support
my
argument.
and
this
--
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
sir?
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
his
name
was
judge
miller.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
we
do
not
know.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
and
we
do
know
that
at
that
time
he
would
have
won
--
won
because
the
objection
by
mr.
casey
had
been
on
the
ground
of
lack
of
materiality.
so
at
least
at
that
time
we
know
what
he
did.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
i
don't
think
sir
i
can
point
to
just
one
place
but
looking
at
page
6-a,
of
course
in
the
first
paragraph
the
one
numbered
one,
it
is
said
that
a
part
of
the
interstate
commerce
of
the
united
states
has
consisted
at
the
transportation
between
the
several
states
of
materials
and
supplies
for
use
in
the
making
of
ready
mixed
concrete.
now
they
never
mention
in
their
indictment,
any
other
part
of
the
commerce
between
the
states,
that's
the
one
part
they
do
mention
and
then
over
on
page
7-a
in
the
paragraph
numbered
four
just
about
60%
of
the
way
down
that
paragraph
four,
i
find
the
words
and
of
course
i
don't
read
the
whole
paragraph,
i
find
the
words
and
the
movement
of
the
aforesaid
materials
and
supplies
in
such
commerce.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
well
the
only
aforesaid
materials
and
supplies
that
have
been
aforementioned
in
the
previous
part
of
this
indictment
were
materials
and
supplies
for
use
in
making
concrete
that
could
have
been
cement.
it
could
also
have
been
sand
and
if
the
judge
had
submitted
a
cement
issue
to
this
jury
i
don't
think
i'd
be
here
complaining
about
it,
i
am
complaining
about
the
steel
product
itself.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
i
think
paragraph
two
is
entirely
consistent
with
my
proposition
that
i
urge
here
and
i
thank
you
very
much
for
reminding
me
of
it.
there
again
for
the
purpose
of
performing
the
contract
causing
those
supplies
and
materials
to
move
in
interstate
commerce
for
the
contract
they
had
to
perform
was
a
contract
to
manufacture
concrete.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
it
certainly
did
not.
now
the
government
says
in
their
brief
that
i'm
warmed
on
this
argument
anyway
because
they
say
it
was
a
question
of
law
for
the
trial
judge
and
then
they
cite
a
lot
of
cases
but
of
course
i
almost
don't
need
to
stand
here
and
say,
that
when
you
check
the
cases
you'll
find
that
the
cases
don't
say
that
the
factual
question
of
whether
commerce
was
obstructed
was
for
the
judge
that's
always
for
the
jury
but
the
cases
do
say
that
it's
alright
for
a
judge
to
tell
a
jury
that
if
they
find
certain
facts,
then
he
tells
them
as
a
matter
of
law,
those
facts
do
constitute
an
obstruction
of
commerce
and
only
in
that
sense
is
this
a
question
for
the
court
instead
of
for
the
jury
and
we
say
the
fact
of
whether
or
not
the
shipment
of
steel
products
was
interfered
with,
was
a
fact
for
the
petit
jury
but
only
after
an
indictment
charged
of
prima
facie
and
only
after
a
grand
jury
made
a
prima
facie
finding
of
the
commission
of
that
felony.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
yes
sir.
entirely.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
correct.
now
--
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
there
were
exceptions
taken
to
the
charge
and
as
to
the
part
of
the
charge
which
dealt
with
the
shipment
of
steel
products
into
commerce
there
was
an
exception
taken
in
one
of
those
speed
words.
your
honor,
i
accept
to
what
you
said
about
the
steel
product.
i
say
i
can't
stand
here
and
say
that
the
exception
was
couched
in
such
language
as
i've
been
trying
to
use
here
to
make
my
point
clear.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
that's
on
page
300-a.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
of
what
sir?
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
yes.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
remember.
i
construe
it
as
counsel
on
the
spot,
it
was
said
a
little
while
ago,
trying
to
make
the
exception
that
i'm
make
here
but
--
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
but
not
as
completely
as
i
make
it
here,
as
to
the
steel
after
he
mentioned
the
sand.
now
the
other
question
in
the
case
involves
whether
this
alleged
interference
was
the
purely
local
activity
of
manufacturing
concrete
had
such
an
effect
on
commerce
between
the
states
that
it
could
be
the
subject
to
this
prosecution
and
of
course
i
should
start
with
the
fact,
i
know
perfectly
well
that
by
scholastic
reasoning
involving
what
somewhat
--
someone
called
abstract
notions,
everything
affects
commerce.
and
that
the
statute
in
this
case
is
very
sweeping
at
what
it
tries
to
reach
and
probably
reached
about
as
much
as
any
statute
one
could
possibly
pass
but
i
still
claim
that
the
effect
upon
commerce
in
this
case
was
not
only
too
distant,
but
also
too
unsubstantial.
that
has
two
aspects.
first
as
to
the
sand,
you
remember
that
rider,
the
alleged
victim
of
this
extortion,
was
in
pennsylvania
and
that
in
pennsylvania,
he
purchased
the
sand
from
ducane
slag
company
which
was
also
in
pennsylvania
which
had
lots
of
other
customers
and
that
slag
company
was
the
one
who
purchased
sand
from
ducane
sand
company
in
another
state.
now,
the
theory
by
which
the
trial
judge
and
by
which
today
the
government
says
that
extortion
directed
against
anyone
as
remotely
connected
with
commerce
between
the
states
that
this
man
rider
can
be
tried
in
federal
court
appears
at
pages
306-a
and
307-a
of
the
record
where
the
trial
judge
in
his
opinion
frankly
said,
starting
five
lines
up
from
the
bottom
of
306-a.
that
statement
was
based
upon
a
premise
that
a
deliberate
act
which
tends
to
prevent
articles
from
being
used,
once
they
have
reached
their
destination,
after
being
shipped
in
interstate
commerce,
then
it
is
up
the
stream
of
commerce
and
delays
and
obstruct
and
defect
interstate
commerce
as
surely
as
though
the
same
act
had
cut
off
the
supply
at
short.
so
what
they're
really
contending
here
today
and
they
cite
united
states
versus
sullivan
as
they
contended
in
their
brief,
what
they're
really
contending
here
today
is
that
an
extortion
or
a
robbery
because
the
hobbs
act
covers
robberies
also,
an
extortion
or
a
robbery
which
would
prevent
a
corner
druggist
from
selling
something
to
a
customer
which
had
originally
come
from
another
state
is
an
extortion
or
robbery
which
can
properly
be
made
and
has
been
made
the
subject
of
federal
jurisdiction.
well
if
that's
so,
you
won't
have
anymore
days
like
today
because
j
edgar
hoover
isn't
going
to
have
time
to
catch
anymore
spies.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
sir?
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
some
evidence
of
some
shipments
consigned
to
rider
but
ordered
by
slag
company.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
i
think
that
the
latter
fact
puts
me
a
little
bit
worst
off
than
i
would
be
otherwise
but
it
seems
to
me
not
so
badly
off
as
to
bring
this
case
within
the
power
of
congress.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
the--
when
it
would--
when
ordered
by
ducane
slag
and
shipped
to
rider,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
shipment
would
of
be
direct
commerce.
if
what
this
seems
to
me
in
answer
to
your
honor's
question
that
even
there,
the
effect
of
an
extortion
as
in
this
case
or
as
in
or
of
a
robbery
as
it
might
be
in
some
other
case,
upon
that
commerce
is
still
entirely
too
remote
to
be
controlled
by
the
congress
power.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
i
thought
of
that
in
train
all
the
way
down
here
and
it
seems
to
me,
i'm
really
arguing
both
that
i
think
congress
in
the
hobbs
act
tried
to
go
almost
as
far
as
they
could
go
under
the
commerce
clause,
i
don't
think
that
either
the
intent
of
congress
whether
the
constitution
reaches
this.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
well
you
see
what
troubles
me
there.
the
government
says
that
congress
tried
to
go
as
far
as
they
could
but
forgetting
robbery
for
the
minute,
they
only
tried
to
cover
extortion
and
they
defined
extortion
as
the
obtaining
of
the
money.
so
whoever,
by
obtaining
money,
interferes
with
commerce,
they
reach.
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
could
even
have
gone
with
it
further
and
could
have
said
whoever
by
obtaining
money
or
by
threatening
to
pull
a
strike
in
effect
interferes
with
commerce
or
threatens
to
interfere
with
commerce
in
violation
of
this
act.
now
it
so
happens
they
didn't
say
that.
they
just
think
to
find
extortion
in
the
narrow
sense
of
receiving
money
so
i
think
that
one
way
they
went
as
far
as
they
could
but
only
with
regard
to
a
very
limited
type
of
extortion,
but
i
just
can't
answer
the
question
yes
or
no.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
a
question
to
where
i
wouldn't
be
--
i
would
be
honored
to
be
here.
incidentally,
the
amount
of
the
extortion
was
not
directly
geared
to
the
amount
of
sand
that
came
in.
it
was
i
would
say
indirectly
geared
to
it.
the
alleged
extortion
was
50
cents
on
every
cubic
yard
of
concrete
so
of
course
you
could
work
it
out
in
relationship
with
the
sand
by
one
step
but
you
wouldn't
need
that
one
step.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
i
can't
say
that
i
recall
none.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
i
think
both
times
they
were
trying
to
reach
as
much
commerce
as
they
could
but
not
as
much
extortion
as
they
perhaps
could.
now
on
the
point
that
i've
been
arguing--
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
that's
why
sir,
i
didn't
try
to
bring
that
out
except
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
court.
i
don't
think
that
the
limited
definition
of
extortion
by
virtue
of
its
limits
helps
me
or
hurts
me.
i
just
thought
i
should
mean
that
it
is
there.
now
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
connection
between
the
alleged
extortion
and
the
receipt
of
the
sand,
i
should
report
that
that's
the
one
question
in
which
chief
judge
biggs
and
circuit
judge
hastie
did
not
agree
with
us.
the
court
below
was
unanimously
against
us
on
that
point,
but
those
two
judges
were
with
us
on
the
point
about
the
man
being
tried
for
something
he
hadn't
been
indicted
for.
and
those
two
judges
were
also
with
us
or
if
one
chief
judge
and
one
other
judge
were
also
with
us
in
the
(inaudible)
which
is
that
if
i
must
assume
as
i
hate
to
do,
that
it
was
alright
to
submit
the
issue
of
interfering
with
the
shipment
of
steel
products
to
this
jury,
if
i
have
to
assume
that,
then
i
say
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
shipment
of
those
steel
products
from
a
plant
which
had
been
built
partly
out
of
concrete
by
a
prime
contractor
for
whom
mr.
stirone
--
pardon
me,
for
whom
the
subcontractor
who
was
the
victim
of
the
alleged
extortion
has
made
the
concrete
is
again
a
matter
in
which
the
relationship
between
the
alleged
extortion
from
rider
who
made
the
concrete
or
rather
mention
the
prime
contractor
who
made
the
factory
with
somebody
else
placed
machines
that
makes
steel
products
that
went
to
somebody
else
from
detroit
was
again
not
close
enough
in
its
relationship
to
interstate
commerce
to
use
one
part
of
mr.
chief
justice
hughes'
phrase
and
as
well
as
not
being
close
enough,
it
wasn't
substantial
enough
in
its
relationship
to
the
shipment
of
the
steel
product.
for
one
reason,
as
judge
hastie
points
out,
there's
nothing
to
show
that
there
were
plenty
of
other
resources
of
concrete.
this
is
no
question
of
a
monopoly
as
in
your
sherman
act
cases
and
when
supported
properly
going
to
authorities.
i
should
add
one
more
thing
that
at
the
time
of
the
extortionate
demand,
no
sand
was
being
received
directly
from
other
states.
it
was
coming
in
to
the
brady
street
yard
of
the
slag
company,
was
being
unloaded
and
piled
up
there,
mixed
with
other
sand
from
pennsylvania
and
then
eventually
sent
away
by
railroad
car
to
rider,
the
alleged
victims
at
the
time
of
extortionate
demand.
later
on,
the
sand
moved
in
the
way
i
told
mr.
justice
whittaker
when
i
responded
to
him.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
asked
for
a
bill
of
particulars,
so
we
could
find
out
among
other
things
what
commerce
they
meant
to
be
talking
about,
the
government
opposed
the
grant
of
the
bill
and
that's
why
that
paragraph
hasn't
been
answered
and
then
in
the
government's
opening
in
this
case
particularly
the
part
at
520(a)
and
521(a)
and
most
particularly
the
top
of
521(a)
in
their
opening,
they
told
us
the
commerce
they
were
talking
about
was
the
sand.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
it
is
true
that
we
were
so
put
on
notice
after
the
trial
began
and
it
is
also
true
that
no
grand
jury
ever
made
a
prima
facie
case
of
such
as
felony
or
prima
facie
finding
if
it's
a
felony.
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
i
would
so
argue
if
necessary
sir,
i
think
they
were
obliged
to
show
in
their
indictment
what
commerce
they
were
talking
about
because
this
statute
prohibits
obstructing
commerce
by
extortion.
it's
not
like
the
labor
management
relations
act
which
prohibits
a
labor
leader
from
accepting
money
from
an
employer
whose
business
affects
commerce.
here
the
extortion
has
to
affect
the
commerce
and
not
as
what
i
should
have
more
truly
answered
mr.
justice
whittaker
yesterday.
sure,
that
sand
on
one
barge
may
have
been
in
commerce,
sir
or
the
record
is
somewhat
ambiguous
on
that,
but
even
if
it
was,
the
crime
couldn't
be
made
out.
if
i
ran
a
corner
cigar
store
and
some
of
my
cigars
came
from
another
state
that
would
be
commerce
just
like
the
sand
on
that
one
alleged
barge.
but
if
a
holdup
man
came
in
and
held
up
my
cigar
store,
i
say
the
effect
on
interstate
commerce
would
be
the
same
as
that
in
this
case
and
the
effect
is
not
enough
for
congressional
jurisdiction.
the
extortion
has
to
affect
commerce.
it's
not
enough
for
the
business
or
the
victim
to
which
to
affect
commerce,
you
have
to
do
something
like
hijacking
a
truck
or
stopping
something
from
actually
moving
in
commerce.
here,
that
was
not
done.
what's
that?
mr.
michael
von
moschzisker
i
would
not
have
supposed
anybody
would
argue
that,
but
when
they
come
before
your
honors
and
cite
the
sullivan
case,
in
support
of
that
position
here,
wonder.
good
afternoon,
mr.
chief
justice.
