suppose

not
sufficient
evidence
for
any
of
the
jurors
to
find
that
the
sand
was
in
commerce,
do
you
--
is
it
your
contention
that
the
man
should
still
be
convicted
on
the
steel
theory?
chief

suppose
six
--

were
of
the
opinion
that
--
that
the

was
not
in
commerce
and
six
jurors
were
of
the
opinion
that
the
steel
was
not
in
commerce
but
together
they
--
they
found
him
--
found
him
guilty.
chief
justice
earl

is
there
any
way
you

this
case
that
they
were
--
all
agreed
that
the
sand
was
the
issue?
