what
about
paragraph
two
of
the
indictment
and
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that
in
bringing
this
indictment
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
notice
in
the
bill
of
particulars,
the
one
in
number
1(a)
which
inquires
as
to
what
the
interstate
commerce
was
that
i
can't
find
that
that
was
--
an
answer
to
that
was
given,
the
motion
to
develop
particulars
requires
as
to
that
the
bill
of
particulars
themselves
doesn't
seem
to
cover
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
1
(a)
says,
“state
where
the
interstate
commerce
referred
to
in
paragraph
2
originated
and
where
it
ended.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
you
can
read
where
it
would
say
it's
referring
only
to
sand
because
it
refers
to
paragraph
2
of
the
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
is
true
that
at
the
time
this
evidence
was
introduced
as
to
the
future
potentialities
of
the
steel
mill
that
you
were
put
on
notice
at
that
time
that
the
government
rightly
or
wrongly
was
going
to
rely
on
that
evidence
as
part
of
its
--
the
commerce
phase
if
it's
in
that
--
of
its
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
the
basic
question
on
that
is,
on
the
indictment
is
whether
the
government
even
though
it
didn't
have
to
specify
it
at
all
what
the
commerce
was
that
it
was
relying
on
by
having
specified
sand,
was
thereafter
precluded
it
from
introducing
any
other
elements
of
obstruction
of
commerce.
