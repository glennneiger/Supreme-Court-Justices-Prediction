justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
explaining
to
me
the
place
in
the
indictment
that
you
rely
on
that
standing
just
the
same?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
cite
paul
against
arkinsas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
case
where
we
held
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
state
that
in
time
it
has
to
go
on
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
know
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly
a
different
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
couldn't
there
be
any
difference
from
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
way
the
federal
government
gets
secu
--(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
otherwise
it
would
have
to
be
emphasized
in
the
statement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
rather
just
to
have
it's
extortion
in
that
sense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
nor
the
(voice
overlap)
of
the
federal
government
can
get
it
on
this
very
thing
you
say
of
enmity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
in
charge
here
towards
the
company
is
to
keep
an
eye
on
things
once
the
(inaudible)
does
that
make
any
difference
in
your
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
rider
come
out
of
it
wouldn't
you
say
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understand
a
bit
in
this
security
offer
they
may
have
made
a
mistake
that
they
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
(inaudible)
guilt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
in
effect
--
you
in
effect
are
arguing
there,
are
you
not,
that
this
would
be
acceptable
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
i
suppose
it's
pretty
well
settled
that
the
government
has
to
prove
these
allegations
as
being
part
of
the
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
didn't
have
anything
to
say
as
it
said
it
all,
that
it
had
appeared
to
be
interstate
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
allege
that
practice
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
if
you
do
allege
more
in
fact
it
is
not
prejudicial
at
all?
