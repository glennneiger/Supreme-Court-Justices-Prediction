did
you
see
the
text?

meaning
that

never
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
what
he
says
some
of
the
work..
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
use
the
word
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
than
it's
as
justice
harlan
did
you
say
that
question
1(a)
was
or
was
not
answered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
see
--
but
the
actual
answer
is
not
in
the
record,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i've
noticed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
seems
to
start
with
the
answer
to
question
six
at
page
112(a).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
what
about
this
--
it
there
any
significance
to
show
mr.
barnett
to
be
attached
to
the
concluding
words
to
paragraph
2
of
the
indictment
and
more
particularly
from
outside
the
state
of
pennsylvania
into
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
that
would
not
be
pertinent
to
steel,
would
it?
