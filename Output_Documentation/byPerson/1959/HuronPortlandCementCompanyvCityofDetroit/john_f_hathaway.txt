mr.
john
f.
hathaway
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
the
city
of
detroit
adopted
the
smoke
ordinance
in
question
about
13
years
ago
and
approximately
a
little
of
four
years
ago,
issued
the
violation
that
is
in
question
in
here
and
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
ordinance
in
question
here.
the
violation
that
we
issued
was
a
violation
that
stated
that
the
appellant,
in
this
case,
issued
smoke
in
violation
in
section
2.
2a,
which
limits
the
emission
of
smoke
in
--
to
a
certain
density.
the
provision
is
governed
pursuant
to
a
ringelmann
chart
which
provides
that
you
cannot
issue
--
smoke
cannot
be
emitted
to
any
greater
density
than
would
be
showing
at
a
no.
2
ringelmann
chart.
this
is
a
standard
form
of
rate
of
measuring
smoke
for
the
purposes
of
a
smoke
abatement
code
and
it's
probably
in
effect
in
all
48
states
and
probably
on
every
industrial
community
in
the
country.
now,
after
we
issued
the
violation,
the
plaintiff
went
into
the
circuit
court.
plaintiff
or
appellant
here,
went
into
the
circuit
court
of
the
county
of
wayne
and
asked
for
an
injunction
to
restrain
us
from
enforcing
the
ordinances
as
to
him,
claiming
that
he
was
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
that
is
ship
had
been
approved
by
coast
guard
pursuant
to
the
federal
regulations
and
that
he
could
be
prosecuted,
but
only
for
the
negligent
operation
of
that
equipment,
combustion
equipment,
which
is
--
the
smoke
the
issue
is
from.
now
circuit
court
of
the
county
of
wayne
determined
only
one
question.
they
determined
that
the
ordinance
was
a
reasonable
regulation
and
that
the
city
had
the
right
to
issue
that
violation,
in
question,
and
prohibit
the
emission
of
dense
smoke.
and
this
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
michigan.
now,
the
appellant
is
before
this
court
arguing
that
question
of
preemption.
i
think
that
the
general
--
when
you
consider
the
general
rules
of
preemption,
this
court
has
determined
that
when
there's
an
actual
conflict
shown
or
there
is
a
repugnancy,
or
if
congress
has
manifested
the
clear
intent
to
regulate
the
field
that
you're
talking
about,
then
the
cities
or
states
do
have
the
right
to
adopt
the
regulation.
now,
first
of
all,
when
you
consider
the
regulation
in
question
and
the
federal
regulation,
i
don't
think
congress
concerned
themselves
in
any
way
with
the
emission
of
smoke
and
that
would
be
--
i
mean,
there's
no
provision
within
that
regulation.
the
original
regulation,
in
answer
to
a
question
here,
was
adopted
in
1871.
in
this
regulation,
from
checking
the
various
sections
of
that
code,
only
goes
to
the
question
of
the
equipment
of
that
ship.
they
make
a
thorough
inspection
of
that
ship
from
the
hull
to
the
combustion
equipment,
to
the
lifeboats
and
every
other
boat,
only
for
the
purpose
to
determine
that
that
boat
can
leave
the
dock
and
travel
in
safety.
and
for
no
other
purpose,
this
was
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
i
would
say
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
i
do
--
by
--
by
reading
those
reports,
the
united
states
code
annotated,
they
point
out
the
information
that
was
put
from
the
congressional
reports
in
there.
where
they
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
--
state
that
just
because
to
limit
the
disaster
at
sea.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
and
they
point
out,
when
they
amended
them
this
year,
that
this
was
the
purpose
and
the
purpose
of
further
amendments
of
code
has
been
to
limit
disaster
at
sea
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no
attempt
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
now,
not
as
to
the
(inaudible)
question,
merely,
but
the
legislators
to
ever
deal
that
was
--
it
was
an
act
of
congress
passed
in
1955.
which
an
appropriation
statute
for
that
purpose
(inaudible)
funds
(inaudible)
various
communities
(inaudible)
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
second
district
would
not
be
able
to
comply
with
our
ordinance.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
no.
i'm
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
it's
a
rough
guess.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
yes,
i
think.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
under
all
conditions.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
the
steamship
in
question,
here,
could
proceed
through
the
detroit
river
and
comply
with
our
ordinance.
however,
the
hand-fired
scotch
marine
boiler
that
(inaudible)
and
when
they're
in
the
(inaudible)
question
here,
they
had
been
pumping
this
black
smoke
out
for
approximately
nine
minutes.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
that
--
to
maintain
their
continued
pressure
to
run
a
self-unloader
--
the
self-unloader
is
--
let
me
see,
well,
it's
a
conveyor
type
system
that
is
put
upon
the
ship
to
dip
the
equipment,
whatever
it
is
--
like
this,
on
this
particular
ship,
get
cement
out
of
the
car
--
out
of
the
cargo
hauls
and
put
it
up
unto
the
shore
at
--
at
some
point.
this
is
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
it
does
not
have
to
change
the
boiler.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
it
continue
to
use
the
boiler
in
question
here,
but
he
wouldn't
have
to
install
like
an
under
--
underfeed
stoker.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
oh,
yes.
i
mean
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
i
think,
in
the
record
would
show
that
there
was
some
steam
liner
and
testified
that
he'd
installed
it
on
approximately
28
ships
in
the
past
three
or
four
years
at
the
time
of
the
testimony.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
oh,
yes.
oh,
there's
no
question
i
think
that
mr.
lindbloom
would
agree
that
he
could
change
his
equipment
anytime
he
wants.
i
mean
--
and
they
would
be
approved
by
the
coast
guard.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
i
mean
to
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
they
testified
that
at
the
trial
and
i
think
it
was
--
uncontroverted
that
approximately
somewhere
between
$75,000
and
$100,000.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well
the
ship's
--
i'm
not
so
sure
though,
the
exact
length
of
the
ship
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
three
to
100
feet,
the
ships
go
on
the
great
lakes
to
anywhere
from
250
feet
to
600
feet.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
not
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no,
that
is
not
true.
i
said
this
is
where
he
would
be
sure
to
violate
the
ordinance
when
you
--
the
operating
the
self-unloader.
the
violation,
of
course,
when
the
--
when
they
talk
about
the
scotch
marine
boilers
such
as
he
has
here,
it's
the
(inaudible)
aboard
the
ship
which
throw
the
coal
in
with
shovels
and
this
is
what
--
where
you
get
your
incomplete
combustion
is
when,
which
they
call
green
coal
hits
the
top
of
the
--
or
the
hot
coals
that
the
heat
that
is
generated
there
carries
it
up
the
flue
or
up
the
stack,
carries
small
particles
which
--
which
i
indicate,
are
black
smoke.
the
underfeed
stoker
brings
in
the
coal
in
from
the
bottom
and
before
it
reaches
the
top
of
it,
more
complete
combustion.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
i
think
they
were
--
i
think
they
were
invented
in
scotland,
it
wouldn't
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
the
coast
guard.
no,
i
think
they
can
answer
your
question
two
ways
that
the
legal
district
officer
for
the
coast
guard
states,
no.
they
have
no
control
over
the
question
of
emission
and
smoke.
i
mean,
it
is
not
whether
--
i
mean
that's
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
(voice
overlap)
his
opinion.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
it
--
that's
the
legal
district
officer
--
legal
coast
guard
district
officer.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
and
he
claims
that
they
have
no
method
of
regulating
the
emission
of
smoke.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
that
is
located
in
the
appendix?
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
it's
in
the
--
it's
on
page
5
(b)
of
the
appellees'
appendix.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
no.
when
i'd
say
60%,
i
don't
--
not
all
--
i'm
talking
about
the
whole
fleet,
marine
fleet.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
both
canadian
and
american
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
--
that
operates
on
the
great
lakes.
now,
many
of
these
ships
are
canalers
that
do
not
come
into
our
area.
what
percentage
of
those
ships
that
come
into
our
area,
i
have
no
way
of
telling.
and
in
the
records,
it's
passengers
--
i
mean
it's
approximately
20,000
passengers
a
year,
through
the
detroit
river.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
yes.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well
--
i
mean,
a
smoke
ordinance
is
not
there.
we
don't
just
issue
tickets.
i
mean,
primarily,
what
you
do
is
issue
notices
of
violation
first.
i
mean,
because
there
are
many
problems
and
being
a
local
regulation
with
our
own
people,
i
mean,
you're
forcing
people
to
spend
a
million
dollars
in
the
city
of
detroit
to
change
some
of
their
equipment.
and,
i
think
in
this
county
of
los
angeles,
the
oil
industry
has
spent
probably
$40
million
changing
certain
equipment.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
that
could
be
--
certainly,
this
notices
of
violation,
we
then
try
to
arrange
conferences
between
the
people
that
own
the
various
equipment
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
--
and
just
ask
them,
if
they
would
be
able
to
do
anything.
well,
and
we
start
out
from
that
point
and
they
start
changing
their
equipment
or
doing
whatever
is
necessary
to
try
to
bring
the
smoke
down
to
where
it
could
comply
with
our
ordinance.
and
then
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
in
most
cases,
yes.
now,
as
to
the
regulation
of
vessels,
it's
very
difficult
for
the
city
of
detroit
to
enforce
this
ordinance
for
the
simple
reason.
when
a
vessel
is
on
the
detroit
river,
you
can
never
tell
without
a
range
finder
or
unless
it's
in
a
specific
location
whether
or
not
the
--
the
ship
is
on
the
american
side
or
the
canadian
side.
now,
we
do
not
have
any
jurisdiction
on
the
canadian
side
of
the
river
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
canadian
government
to
enforce
their
regulations
as
to
air
pollution
on
that
side.
there's
only
a
certain
specific
location
in
the
detroit
river
although
a
ship
might
proceed
the
whole
length
of
the
river,
emitting
this
smoke.
if
they
are
emitting
smoke
at
this
one
specific
location,
when
we
know
for
sure
that
they
are
on
the
detroit
side
of
the
river,
and
we
know
this
because
the
water
in
the
canadian
side
at
this
point
is
so
shallow
that
they
could
not
proceed
through
there.
we
then
give
them
a
ticket.
and
we
don't
always
prosecute
on
those
tickets.
if
they
would
come
into
our
bureau
and
put
themselves
to
that
bureau
before,
to
discuss
the
matter
to
see
what
could
be
done
if
directed
--
this
--
this
matter
by
continuing
violations.
because
we
know
that
they
do
have
a
problem
and
we
do
give
them
time
and
that
we
like
the
railroads
in
changing
over
from
steam
to
diesel
and
i'm
speaking
specifically
of
the
railroads
that
do
the
switching
within
the
city
of
detroit,
we
give
them
a
period
of
approximately
eight
years
we
agreed
that
they
would
take
eight
years
to
change
their
equipment.
because
i
mean,
you
just
can't
win
it.
have
railroad
pull
40
to
50
switch
engines
out
of
business
and
leave
them
with
nothing
to
operate
with,
so,
i
mean
that's
it's
--
it's
--
make
--
have
to
make
adaptation
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
this
example,
pittsburgh
steamship
company
has
approximately
20
ships
and
about
10
of
them
comply
--
when
i
talk
--
when
you
talk
about
comply
--
i
mean,
by
--
by
that
we
mean,
able
to
comply
with
our
emission
standards
and
our
code.
they
say
they
--
they
will
change
the
other
ships.
the
rest
of
the
fleet
will
change.
i
mean,
we're
having
this
problem.
many
will
change,
if
the
others
would
change,
but
nobody
wants
to
spend
their
money
unless
the
other
ships
in
the
same
classification
will
spend
the
money.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well
--
well,
yes.
it's
kind
of
a
two-headed
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
i'm
going
to
talk
about
first
--
i
think
almost
every
state
has
--
some
of
the
cities
within
almost
every
state
in
the
union
have
this
smoke
ordinance.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
now,
let's
talk
about
navigation.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
i
know
that
the
city
of
new
york
has,
the
city
of
new
orleans,
the
county
and
city
of
los
angeles,
and
then
they
have
in
san
francisco,
they
have
what
they
call
a
bay
area
ordinance.
it's
an
application
of
probably
six
counties
which
was
adopted
pursuant
to
a
state
regulation
out
there.
now,
these,
l
know,
for
sure
because
we
worked
with
these
people
and
the
city
of
new
orleans,
i
know,
from
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
michigan
where
he
contacted
the
district
legal
officer
of
the
united
states
coast
guard
where
he
stated
about
the
--
the
problems
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
in
enforcing
their
ordinances
to
ships.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no,
because
i
didn't
--
probably
it
wasn't
exactly
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
--
contained
within
the
record.
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
yes,
this
helped.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
this
is
true.
you
--
any
equipment
can
smoke.
you
can
take
the
finest
oil
burning
equipment
and
if
you
don't
operate
it
right,
in
other
words
you
have
to
have
a
mixture
of
oxygen
and
the
fluid
that
you're
burning
of
just
the
proper
mixture.
i
mean,
the
united
states
navy
could
take
their
whole
fleet
from
--
i
think,
from
san
diego
to
the
harbors
of
japan
and
never
allow
any
smoke
to
be
seen
on
the
horizon.
i
mean,
this
is
not
an
impossible
situation.
but,
if
you
come
in
and
something
goes
wrong
with
the
equipment,
then
they're
liable
to
smoke
or
if
it's
operated
carelessly,
it
would
smoke.
now,
in
the
--
he
points
out
about
the
queen
mary.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
as
this
one.
now,
in
that
case,
what
happened
there,
they
point
out
that
it
--
at
least
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
did
that
this
steamship
was
not
immune
from
prosecution.
they
could
be
prosecuted,
but
the
lower
court
did
not
allow
this
--
the
queen
mary
to
--
to
interject
a
defense
that
at
the
time
that
the
smoke
was
emitted,
some
equipment
had
been
broken
down
or
a
situation
existed
where
they
could
do
nothing
but
smoke.
i
mean,
that
seems
to
be
reasonable.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no,
it
could
comply.
there
is
not
any
regulation
that
i
know
of
that
is
more
stringent
than
the
no.2
ringelmann
requirement,
as
--
as
set
forth
in
our
ordinance.
a
little
--
i've
heard
testimonies
that
there
was
but,
i
don't
know
of
any
ordinance.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
yes.
but
my
explanation
for
that
is,
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
an
--
a
city
adopted
a
more
stringent
regulation
that
could
not
be
complied
with,
we'll
say,
with
an
underfeed
stoker.
if
it
could
not
be
complied
with
an
underfeed
stoker,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
applied
within
the
boiler
either.
i
don't
think.
this
i'm
not
too
sure.
however,
if
that
ordinance
that
was
reasonable,
as
to
that
community,
for
the
necessary
--
and
necessary
for
the
health
of
those
citizens,
i
think
that
that
type
of
regulation
should
be
more
stringent.
maybe
you
would
have
to
change
this
equipment
again.
in
the
city
of
los
angeles,
they
have
developed
an
ordinance
which
goes
beyond
almost
anything.
they
still
provide
for
this
no.
2
ringelmann.
it's
the
same
type
of
density.
but
what
they
have
done,
they
have
provided
for
what
they
call
an
alert
system
where
they
--
as
that
smog
in
that
area
continues
to
get
thicker,
they
will
then
notify
certain
people
and
they
will
the
announcements
on
radios
and
other
types
of
publications
to
request
that
people
will
quit
driving.
after
they
go
through
so
many
alert
systems
and
when
they
reach
the
final
system,
they
provide
for
a
notice
to
the
governor
and
then
the
governor
--
this
is
what
it
says,
but
in
effect,
it
amounts
to
like
martial
law.
or
they're
going
to
trucks
off
the
street
and
the
automobiles
and
people
will
be
refused
permission
to
drive
until
that
smog
has
either
raised
(inaudible)
that
he's
presented
here
--
the
steamships
could
go
into
the
harbors
at
los
angeles
and
while
they
were
carrying
people
to
the
hospital,
he
would
be
able
to
say,
“we're
awfully
sorry
about
--
we're
going
to
have
to
continue
the
smoke.”
no,
i
don't
think
that
the
commerce
clause
was
intended
to
be
anything
more
than
that
there
would
be
for
the
general
welfare
of
all
the
people
of
the
country.
in
other
words,
the
commerce
clause,
i
think,
should
be
interpreted
that
it
benefits
all
of
us
and
that
it
would
--
and
there
should
be
no
barriers
put
up
to
stop
the
free
flow
of
commerce.
but
i
don't
think
it
should
be
turned
around
and
say,
“well,
while
it's
benefiting
certain
people,
the
others
must
all
suffer
a
detriment
to
their
health.”
i
don't
think
that
the
commerce
clause
has
provided
that
we
can
protect
the
concrete
on
--
on
our
streets.
we
can't
protect
their
lungs
in
this
type
of
contamination
and
air
pollution.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
oh,
no.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no,
i
mean,
our
ordinance
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
our
ordinance
sets
up
a
particular
standard
of
emissions
and
which,
under
certain
conditions,
they
can
emit
more
smoke
or
less
smoke
at
a
given
time
depending
on
what
you
are
doing
at
that
time.
almost
every
--
they
couldn't
--
if
he
lessens
his
--
the
output
of
the
smoke,
he
could
not
then
be
in
violation
of
another
community,
because,
i
mean,
that
would
be
their
purpose,
too.
the
only
purpose
of
any
regulation
is
to
limit
the
emission
of
smoke.
and
i
mean,
if
you
--
if
i
--
if
the
city
of
detroit
is
instrumental
in
making
the
instrument
then
our
state
commerce
emit
less
smoke,
it
could
not
necessarily
be
in
violation
of
another
community.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
that
isn't
exactly
what
i
said.
but
let's
assume
that
that
laws
--
no
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
oh,
i
said
that
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
the
--
the
emissions
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
the
emission
standards
in
both
cities
are
the
same.
however,
i
said
that
the
county
of
los
angeles
has
done
more
things
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
--
more
things
in
their
ordinance
to
where
they
will
control
not
the
emission
standard,
but
to
the
elimination
of
any
type
of
instrumental
that
would
emit
smoke,
under
certain
smog
conditions.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
but
assume
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
but
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
i
think
that
situation
could
eventually
exist.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
--
we
should
declare
this
ordinance
unconstitutional,
because
of
a
hypothetical
situation
which
does
--
which
the
record
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
--
doesn't
show,
now.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no,
but
i
think
in
--
let's
--
in
considering
the
statute
in
question,
the
federal
regulation
--
i
mean
the
license
and
then
none
of
it
--
that
--
but
the
license
is
just
the
reflection
that
the
statute
has
been
--
complied
with.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
yes,
we
just
provide
a
standard
for
emission.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
i
mean,
we
don't
tell
them
what
type
of
equipment.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
and
i
--
i
don't
think
we'd
want
to
tell
them
what
type
of
equipment
to
use.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
we'll
make
that,
their
own
discretion.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
could
continue
to
use
the
equipment
they
have
and
first
--
then
they
could
--
and
naturally,
they
would
probably
suffer
the
consequences
of
the
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
(voice
overlap)
well,
i
mean
--
there's
nothing
--
there's
nothing
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
i
am
too
sure
i
understood
you.
let
me
explain
it,
your
honor,
if
i
may.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
our
ordinane,
what
i
was
saying,
doesn't
make
any
specific
requirements
as
to
the
designs
of
equipment.
but
if
he
does
violate
the
emission
standards,
then
we
would
--
he
would
suffer
the
penalties,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
i
think,
i'd
agree
--
i
would
have
to
say,
yes,
he
probably
would.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well
i'm
--
i've
never
seen
it
like
myself
except
that
there
were
witnesses
that
testified
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
--
that
at
this
time
that
they
would
violate
the
smoke
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
that
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
that
would
be
--
the
--
the
case
cited
by
the
--
by
the
appellant
appear
(inaudible)
any
coast
line
case?
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
in
--
in
that
case
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
yes.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
now,
in
that
case
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
prior
--
prior
to
the
license,
this
case
coming
into
this
court,
there'd
been
decisions
wherein
they
had
said
that
the
federal
government
had
not
preempted
that
entire
field.
then
with
the
amendment
to
this
boiler
act,
they
said
the
federal
government
had
now
preempted
the
entire
field
that
there
had
been
a
manifest
intent
by
the
federal
government
to
--
to
take
over
the
entire
field.
now,
if
that
state
law
was
the
same
type
of
legislation
as
the
federal
government
has,
they
didn't
specifically
point
out
cab
curtains
in
the
federal
--
regulations,
but
they
were
both
what
amounted
to
was
a
regulation
of
--
of
railroads,
specifically
aimed
at
interstate
commerce.
our
regulation
was
purely
a
local
regulation
and
was
not
aimed
at
interstate
commerce.
our
regulations
had
to
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
actually
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
they
could.
i
mean,
the
law
provides
what
they
shall
do
and
i
think
the
rules
and
regulations
must
have
some
basis
in
the
law
that
has
been
adopted.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
yes,
i
do,
to
this
extent
that
the
--
i
assume
when
i
--
i
think
we
must
assume
that
congress
knows
what
their
--
about
and
that
they
--
when
they
took
--
when
they
made
this
--
when
they
passed
this
act,
they
passed
for
the
purpose
of
appropriating
money
to
give
aid
to
the
various
communities
and
it
pointed
out
that
there
we
was
not
interstate
question
involved.
this
--
i'm
talking
about
in
their
report.
in
the
act,
it
points
out
that
the
primary
responsibility
of
air
pollution
rests
with
the
local
government
and
it
would
--
i
wouldn't
assume
that
congress
being
aware
of
the
air
pollution
situation
and
congress
being
aware
of
the
--
the
federal
government
had
no
air
pollution
law
or
standards
of
purity
and
then
this
an
argument
where
you
can
argue
both
ways,
i
would
assume
that
they
did
--
they
did
not
want
it.
those
instruments
engaged
in
interstate
--
interstate
commerce
to
be
immune
from
prosecution.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
yes.
i
think,
as
far
as
the
congress
of
the
united
states
is
concerned,
they
stated
that
air
pollution
problems
were
the
primary
responsibility
of
local
government.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
i
agree
--
i
agree
with
that
that
they
don't.
but
i
would
assume
that
congress
being
--
in
adopting
one
law,
would
have
to
be
aware
that
there
is
--
had
another
regulation
also
adopted.
and
i
would
assume
that
--
at
least,
i
think,
it
should
be
argued
that
in
adopting
the
second
regulation
or
the
later
regulation,
their
appropriation
for
air
pollution,
that
they
knew
that
the
existence
of
the
first
regulation
with
steamships
and
then,
if
they
wanted
to
eliminate
steamships
from
complying
with
any
local
regulations
as
to
air
pollution,
they
might
well
have
stated
so.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
i'm
not
--
at
--
at
cleveland.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
one
difference,
i
mean
it
provides
the
same
thing
and
except
that
it
provides
for
a
certain
length,
longer
time
for
the
emission
pursuant
to
another
ringelmann
classification.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
oh,
i
haven't
thought
of
it.
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
they
would
be
bound
by
the
most
--
as
long
as
they're
going
into
the
port
--
into
the
territorial
waters
of
that
city,
i
think
that
they
would
be
bound
by
that
regulation,
if
the
regulation
is
reasonable
of
itself.
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
community
to
prove
that
the
emission
as
provided
in
most
of
the
municipal
ordinances
--
i
mean
to
lessen
that.
in
other
words,
they
provide
for
an
--
the
emission
of
smoke
in
a
density
equal
to
a
no.
2
ringelmann,
which
is
no.
2
ringelmann
is
a
chart
put
up
the
bureau
of
mines
which
provides
for
what
sets
up
a
visual
observations
of
smoke
that
for
--
for
purposes
of
smoke
density.
i
--
i'm
not
too
sure
that
you
could
get
testimony
to
prove
that
if
you
were
going
to
lessen
the
emissions
or
require
that
the
emissions,
he
can
be
less
than
the
standard
that
you
would
be
able
to
have
people
testify
to
that
fact
that
it
would
--
that
it
could
be
complied
with
and
therefore,
it
would
make
be
unreasonable
as
a
local
regulation,
that
even
considering
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
none.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
you
mean
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
what
--
i
can't
i
hear
the
last
part,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
with
--
where
the
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
yes,
i
would
say
so.
i
mean,
in
effect,
they've
done
the
same
thing.
i
mean,
they've
said
that
you
have
to
put
in
a
boiler
that's
of
such
and
such
a
construction,
such
and
such
a
steel,
such
and
such
a
strength.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no,
i
think
that
congress
didn't
pass
an
air
pollution
law.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
passed
an
air
pollution
law
--
i
mean
the
smoke
laws.
and
i
think
that
they
can
officially
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no,
i'm
basing
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
i'm
--
well,
my
--
my
argument
is
that
congress
has
not
done
it.
i
mean
that
the
--
the
intent
of
congress
on
the
deregulations
that
are
now
in
existence,
do
not
cover
the
same
field
that
we're
in
on
as
far
as
the
city
of
detroit
ordinance
is
concerned.
i
mean,
we're
getting
--
we're
showing
that
they're
showing
the
preemption
by
inference.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
oh
--
i
--
yes,
i
think
congress
could
do
that.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
yes,
i
think
that
they
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
under
the
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
i
think
that
they
manifested
a
clear
intent
in
that
purpose.
i
--
i
think
that
they
could,
because
i
think
the
commerce
clause
gives
them
the
complete
and
absolute
power
to
do
what
they
want
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
has
not.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
put
that
--
put
that
in
the
corporation
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
yes.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
oh,
i
don't
think
that
they
could
do
it
in
affecting
--
affecting
local
matters
but
i
think,
they
could
pass
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no,
i
think
in
the
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
--
terms
of
the
commerce
clause,
they
could.
if
in
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
that's
correct.
and
i
think
that
when
you
consider
the
--
the
question
of
our
--
the
--
the
local
police
powers,
and
i
mean
--
i
think
that
this
court
is
determined
that
you
should
weigh
the
national
interest
versus
the
local
interest,
i
think
the
health
and
welfare
of
the
citizens
of
the
city
of
detroit
and
all
the
rest
of
the
communities
that
have
similar
ordinance
far
outweighs
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
steamships
would
use
devices
which
could
comply
with
the
various
ordinances
in
the
country.
i
don't
think
that
it's
as
difficult
to
--
to
eliminate
smoke
as
it
--
as
maybe
some
people
would
think.
i
think
that
--
as
an
example,
i
pointed
out
that
one
thing.
i
think
that
the
whole
united
states
navy
could
be
moved
across
an
ocean
without
smoke
and
then
--
and
all
that
uses
oil
--
oil
burning
type
of
equipment
which
is
installed
in
many
ships,
similar
kind
that
operate
in
the
detroit
river
and
the
great
lakes
area.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
that
--
that
is
an
argument
that's
put
forth
by
the
plaintiff.
you
know,
the
--
in
the
argument
of
uniformity
would
always
be
good.
i
mean,
it
would
--
if
the
congress
of
the
united
states
would
adopt
the
regulation
covering
all
these
problems,
i
suppose
you
could
argue
that
that
would
be
good
and
they
would
not
have
an
argument.
but
until
they
do,
i
don't
think
that
the
cities
under
their
reserved
powers
should
be
precluded
from
adopting
health
regulations
for
the
citizens
in
their
own
communities.
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
very
difficult
situation
to
always
weigh
the
national
interest
versus
the
local
in
considering
those
problems
but
i
don't
think
that
the
commerce
clause
in
this
situation,
by
its
very
force,
precludes
us
from
adopting
air
pollution
ordinance.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
well,
we
treat
them
all
alike
except
--
we
have
--
we
have
a
problem
there.
you're
talking
about
prosecution.
we
just
have
a
very
difficult
problem
in
getting
service
or
process.
i
mean,
the
ships
are
not
located
necessarily
in
the
state
of
michigan.
and
when
it
comes
through
the
detroit
river,
they
have
a
question,
imagine,
just
issuing
a
ticket
if
they
do
--
do
not
have
any
resident
agents
in
the
state
of
michigan.
and
if
they
do
not
operate
in
the
state
of
michigan,
except
to
proceed
through
your
territorial
waters,
that's
one
thing
and
it's
kept
by
a
question
of
constitutional
enforcement
in
the
ordinance
to
a
minimum.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
no.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
the
problem
has
been
this.
10
years
ago,
the
city
of
detroit
and
the
state
of
michigan
asked
the
international
joint
commission
to
make
the
study
to
see
if
there
would
a
federal
regulation
and
the
canadian
regulations.
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
there
was
just
one
more
point
that
i
wish
to
bring
to
this
court's
attention.
the
plaintiff
argues
that
we
are
demanding
inspection
and
licensing.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
we
have
never
demanded
an
annual
inspection.
we
have
never
demanded
that
they
obtain
a
license.
there's
no
provision
exactly
for
licenses,
what
they
call
a
certificate
of
compliance.
being
a
local
regulation,
when
the
matter
was
adopted,
when
the
ordinance
was
adopted,
we
wanted
anybody
to
put
in
new
furnaces,
new
equipment
to
obtain
permits
in
the
city
of
detroit,
the
building
department.
and
subsequent
to
that,
they
would
make
an
inspection
as
to
their
proper
installation
and
also
to
the
smoke
characteristics.
at
least
the
smoke
abatement
bureau
would
do
this.
now,
it's
our
contention
that
we
also
adopted
a
severability
clause
within
our
own
ordinance.
and
the
purpose
of
that
natural
indefinite
severability
clause
is
so
that
if
there
are
any
provisions
within
the
ordinance
which
would
be
unconstitutional
or
be
in
contravention
of
the
--
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
the
state
of
michigan,
that
this
section
could
be
eliminated
and
not
considered.
now,
the
inspection
and
licensing
of
steamship
has
never
been
contemplated
by
the
city
of
detroit.
13
years,
we've
never
demanded
it
or
in
any
other
instrument
of
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
now,
that
section
also
was
adopted
which
provides
that
--
we
don't
say
that
--
seizure
of
ships.
all
it
says
is
that
equipment,
if
in
--
used
in
the
city
of
detroit,
violates
our
ordinance
three
times,
we
then
can
seal
the
equipment.
is
this
the
section
you're
referring
to?
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
now
--
mr.
john
f.
hathaway
now,
we
have
never
done
that.
that
section
also
provides
that
if
we
can't
obtain
service
on
the
owner
of
our
process,
that
we
will
post
a
notice
on
the
premises
at
the
place
of
violation
which
would
require
us
to
post
a
notice
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
detroit
river.
i
mean
this
in
--
this
section
of
the
ordinance
was
clearly
intended
as
a
local
regulation
from
there.
we've
never
applied
it
to
any
instrument
in
--
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
and
if
the
court
is
to
be
concerned
with
that
section,
we
argue
that
our
ordinance
is
severable.
these
sections
have
no
application
and
no
necessity
except
in
aids
in
enforcing
the
purpose
of
the
ordinance
which
is
the
control
of
what
comes
out
of
the
stack
and
not
a
regulation
of
the
combustion
and
equipment,
except
that
i
suppose
in
--
by
inference.
