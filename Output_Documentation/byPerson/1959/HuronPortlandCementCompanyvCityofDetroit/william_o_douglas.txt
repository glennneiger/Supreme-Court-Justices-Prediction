justice
william
o.
douglas
for
example,
what
you
--
what
you
point
--
i
suppose,
your
real
point
of
emphasis
is
on
page
41
of
the
record
where
the
coast
guard
officer
specifies
the
type
of
boilers
that
you
have
for
use
and
the
type
of
fuel
that
you
have
for
use.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
you
wanted
to
put
an
all
--
an
oil
burner
and
you
get
to
that
--
get
a
new
certificate.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
did
you
say
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
did
you
say
to
the
appellant's
argument
that
refers
on
page
42
of
his
brief
in
the
new
york
(inaudible)
four
of
these
--
these
ship
--
the
question
that
is
applied
to
the
court
and
then
two
weeks
later,
adopted
new
york,
might
rather
follow
what
new
york
did.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
true?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
all
--
all
the
ship
in
--
of
ours
here
in
detroit
installs
in
the
underfeed
stoker,
then
goes
to
new
york,
would
it
be
subject
to
prosecution
in
new
york?
justice
william
o.
douglas
there
is
some
suggestion
in
this
--
in
this
record
that
--
that
you
can
--
you
can
spend
his
10
or
20
or
whatever
thousand
dollars
if
--
to
comply
with
--
with
detroit
to
enter
into
another
harbor,
he
might
--
he
might
be
in
trouble
there.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
i
think
the
reference
was
to
the
underfeed
stoker,
but
i'm
not
sure.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
see
it
as
you
--
but
treated
the
napier
case
in
your
brief,
did
i
overlook
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
i
just
want
on
how
you
--
how
you
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
distinguish?
that
was
the
georgia
case
that
required
automatic
fire
doors
on
locomotives,
remember?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
then
wisconsin
case
required
cab
curtains
on
railroad?
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
there
was
no
order
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
requiring
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
may
i
put
you
this
question,
supposed
that
the
coast
guard
issued
a
certificate
conditionally,
on
the
equipment
of
this
vessel
with
--
with
a
boiler
that
did
not
give
out
smoke
or
smoke-free,
would
that
be
valid
regulation
of
the
coast
guard?
