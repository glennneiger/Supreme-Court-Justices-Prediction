chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
--
in
the
inspection
service
of
the
coast
guard
to
--
to
indicate
that
--
that
the
government
has
any
standards
or
--
or
is
interested
in
how
much
smoke
these
boilers
emit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
only
sanction
with
the
ordinance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
prevent
the
--
to
prevent
the
--
the
--
to
tie
the
ship
up?
is
that
the
only
sanction
in
the
ordinance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
the
other
sanctions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
attack
the
whole
ordinance,
the
entire
ordinance
before
they
have
applied
any
sanction
to
the
company.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
has
it
been
violated
twice
before
and
so
found
criminally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
then,
in
this
--
in
this
action,
they
couldn't
impose
the
final
sanction
of
--
of
tying
that
to
your
ship,
could
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
customs
service
certificate
have
anything
to
do
with
safety?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
how
is
it
pertinent
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
license
to
do
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
isn't
that
only
so
far
as
the
--
the
customs
laws
are
concerned?
isn't
that
all
it's
concerned
with?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
the
coast
guard
didn't
--
didn't
certify
it,
it
couldn't?
it
couldn't
travel
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
with
the
second.
so
there'd
be
no
necessity
of
the
customs
service
bothering
about
customs
on
the
ship
if
it
couldn't
--
if
it
couldn't
under
the
coast
guard
certificate
use
the
coastline,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
the
second
one
means
nothing
in
this
case
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
it
doesn't
deal
--
it
doesn't
deal
with
anything
but
customs.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
it
deal
with?
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
the
customs
service
have
anything
to
do
with
safety?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
do
you
say
it
depends
upon
the
safety?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
that
the
--
that
the
coast
guard
certifies
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
that
customs
service
is
--
is
interested
in
the
operation
of
the
vessel
from
the
standpoint
of
--
of
the
customs.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
i
would
assume
nothing
else
unless
there's
something
in
the
act
to
--
to
indicate
something
else.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
--
if
it
cannot
--
if
it
doesn't
have
the
certificate
of
the
coast
guard
and
can't
operate
at
all,
then
of
course
there's
no
--
there's
no
reason
why
the
--
the
customs
service
should
--
should
grant
a
certificate
and
isn't
that
the
only
reason
that
they
require
first
a
certificate
of
the
coast
guard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
my
point
is
this,
if
you
are
going
to
the
question
of
preemption.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
use
--
and
using
the
second
--
the
second
certificate
as
an
argument
that
the
government
has
preempted
it.
i
suppose
that
the
purpose
of
the
certificate
would
have
--
have
something
to
--
to
do
with
determining
whether
there
was
preemption
so
far
as
the
emission
of
the
smoke
is
concerned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
suppose
this,
that
instead
of
this
being
a
vessel,
it
was
--
it's
one
of
these
big
diesel
trucks
that
goes
along
a
--
an
interstate
highway
and
is
authorized
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
--
to
go
through
the
cities
and
it
goes
through
the
cities
emitting
just
as
much
of
that
black
smoke
as
it
wants
to
emit
without
--
without
any
power
in
the
cities
to
--
to
restrain
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
the
fact
of
the
matter,
the
cities
do,
don't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
the
issue
we
have
here
in
that
case
was
not
the
one
we
did
have
but
suppose
that
the
trains,
they're
running
their
trains
75
miles
an
hour
through
a
--
through
a
thickly
populated
district,
do
you
think
the
city
would
be
prevented
from
--
from
regulating
the
speed
of
that
to
conform
to
the
safety
of
the
public?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
said
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
have,
more
like
what
we've
got
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
--
how
about
the
--
the
diesel
--
big
diesel
trucks?
certainly,
the
--
the
local
communities
and
the
states
can
have
something
to
say
about
the
smoke
they
emit
and
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
--
and
the
situation
that
justice
frankfurter
has
just
spoken
to
you
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
--
that
isn't
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make.
this
--
this
big
diesel
trucks,
if
they
don't
have
something
on
the
--
on
their
exhaust,
emit
this
--
this
smoke
as
they
go
along
in
the
highway
to
--
to
the
--
the
detriment
of
traffic
and
to
create
smog
conditions
and
other
--
other
things
of
that
kind.
and
--
and
probably
they
can't
operate
without
doing
that,
unless
they
put
some
attachment
on
their
--
on
their
truck.
but
if
they
do
put
in
--
an
attachment
on
there,
they
can
diffuse
that
smoke,
so
that
it
doesn't
create
those
hazardous
conditions.
now,
what
is
the
difference
between
--
if
--
if
i'm
correct
in
that,
what
is
the
difference
between
compelling
him
to
put
something
--
some
equipment
on
their
automobile
to
control
that
--
that
smoke
on
the
one
hand
then
on
the
other
hand,
requiring
you
to
do
somewhat
similar
thing
with
your
boilers
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
accomplish
the
same
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
a
question
--
maybe
a
question
of
degree,
but
we're
going
here
to
power
--
to
the
question
of
whether
the
federal
government
has
preempted
this
field
and
whether
the
state
has
any
power
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
is
nothing
in
--
nothing
in
this
act
as
you
have
said
--
you
have
told
us
that
specifically
shows
that
they've
covered
this
situation
either.
and
there's
nothing
in
their
inspection
practices
or
in
their
regulations
that
show
that
they
--
they
have
any
concern
with
this.
and
why
doesn't
that
bear
on
the
question
of
preemption
in
the
same
way
as
--
as
that
you
have
described?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hathaway,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hathaway,
to
deal
with
a
legislative
history
of
(inaudible)
in
your
--
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
big
are
these
ships?
chief
justice
earl
warren
three
to
100
feet.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
says
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
effort.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
hathaway,
last
--
in
our
last
term,
we
had
a
highway
case
where
we
struck
down
a
law
of
the
state
of
--
of
illinois
under
the
commerce
clause
and
in
that
case,
the
state
of
illinois
required
certain
equipment
on
trucks
that
flaps
on
them
for
rainy
weather,
for
bad
weather.
now,
the
--
the
contention
was
--
contention
was
made
on
the
part
of
those
who
were
attacking
the
ordinance
that
if
they
complied
with
this
illinois
law
as
soon
as
they
got
over
into
--
into
arkansas,
that
that
equipment
would
be
illegal
and
that
because
of
that,
it
was
--
it
would
be
a
burden
on
commerce.
now,
do
you
have
anything
of
that
kind
in
this
--
in
this
case?
if
these
people
complied
with
the
detroit
city
ordinance,
would
that
very
compliance
with
your
detroit
ordinance
make
this
illegal
in
any
part
of
the
united
states,
so
far
as
you
know
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
--
i
don't
argue
with
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hathaway,
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
does
--
does
your
ordinance
attempt
to
--
to
tell
the
petitioner
here
how
they
shall
satisfy
the
ordinance,
how
they
shall
--
shall
remedy
their
ship
in
order
to
keep
the
density
down
or
do
you
just
say
that
they
shall
keep
the
density
of
smoke
down
below
a
certain
level?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
may
i
ask
you
this
question
to
bring
it
down
to
practical
terms.
your
--
your
state
or
your
city
ordinance
provides
that
a
certain
level
of
density,
now,
we'll
call
that
two.
i
think
you
mentioned
two
something
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
don't
know
what
it
will
--
will
say
that's
two.
now,
supposed
the
government
said
that
this
state
is
or
this
ship
is
authorized
to
--
to
travel
on
the
great
lakes
for
one
year
provided
it
--
the
smoke
it
emits
does
not
exceed
four
which
would
be
twice
the
--
the
amount
of
--
of
smoke
that
your
city
ordinance
requires.
if
it
specifically
directed
its
attention
to
that
subject
in
that
manner,
do
you
have
any
doubt
with
what
the
federal
government
could
--
could
do
that
and
preempt
the
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
your
contention
is
that
it
has
not
done
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all,
mr.
andrews.
very
well.
