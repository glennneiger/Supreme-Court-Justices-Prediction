justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
quite
understand
the
last
statements
you
made
when
you
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
they
cannot
comply
with
the
ordinance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
--
it's
impossible
to
comply
with
the
ordinance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
--
but
now
i
understand
that
you're
qualifying
it
that
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
assuming
that
it's
impossible
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
question
of
cost.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
simply
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
do
you
think
because
that
it's
affected
by
preemption.
as
in
effect,
preemption.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
shows
it
specifically
and
expressly
that
the
government
agreed
that
vessels
which
would
emit
this
kind
of
smoke
could
be
utilized
despite
the
city
ordinance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
have
--
does
it
--
does
a
federal
government
regulation
have
any
provisions
as
to
smoke
control
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
that's
the
closest
you
come
to
any
federal
regulation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
tried
to
do
that
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
don't
--
we
don't
have
an
actual
effort
to
do
that
under
the
ordinance.
we
don't
yet
because
as
i
tried
to
explain
in
my
reply
brief,
the
--
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
in
michigan
and
as
soon
as
--
soon
as
the
city
started
to
--
to
enforce
the
--
the
penalty
provision,
we
got
the
injunction
and
--
but
we
allege
in
our
bill
of
complaint
that
the
city
has
threatened
to
enforce
the
ordinance
against
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
it
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
congress
had
authorized
use
of
this
particular
kind
of
a
vessel,
would
your
position
be
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
still
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
would
still
say
that
the
city
could
--
ordinance
would
provide
it.
if
they
have
expressly
provided
an
act
of
congress
and
thus
was
moving
in
interstate
commerce
move
that
this
kind
of
boiler,
what
would
you
about
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
that
congress
had
passed
a
statute
which
expressly
authorized
the
use
of
this
type
of
boiler
on
ships
moving
in
interstate
commerce,
would
you
say
your
ordinance
must
then
--
valid
as
against
his?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
--
what
you're
saying
in
is
that
the
united
states
cannot
regulate
borders
so
far
as
controlling
the
emission
of
smoke
is
concerned
move
into
various
city
ordinance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
it
didn't
do
that,
but
concluded
to
permit
ships
--
let's
assume
that
it
included
that
it
would
permit
ships
to
move
in
interstate
commerce
with
boilers
precisely
like
this
with
full
knowledge
of
fact.
it
violated
some
city
ordinance.
would
you
say
that
your
city
ordinance
would
withstand
or
that
it
can
rest
on
enactment
would
stand.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
if
you're
basing
it
on
a
constitutional
ground
or
the
power
of
the
federal
government
of
our
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
if
congress
hasn't
done
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
its
part
of
your
argument.
it
seemed
directed
though
it
wasn't
saying
that
congress
couldn't
do
that
even
if
it
wants.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it
could
regulate
and
say
that
this
particular
type
of
boiler
could
move
into
the
waters
of
interstate
commerce
into
detroit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
act
would
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
supreme
over
the
city
ordinance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
your
argument
is
based
wholly
on
the
fact
that
you
say
congress
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
has
not
authorized
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
another
constitutional
rule
that's
been
followed
sometimes
i
have
not
always
agreed
with
it
(inaudible)
followed
the
courts
to
the
extent
that
the
commerce
clause
in
and
of
itself
require
uniformity
in
certain
matters
in
order
to
achieve
a
uniform
operation,
whatever
this
business
is,
that's
going
on.
what
do
you
say
about
that
phase
of
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
the
court
would
not
be
justified
in
finding
that
uniformity
is
so
essential
in
this
field
to
ordering
that
this
must
stricken
down
on
the
commerce
clause
alone?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
seizure
of
the
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
seizure
of
the
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
well
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we're
in
the
same
results.
