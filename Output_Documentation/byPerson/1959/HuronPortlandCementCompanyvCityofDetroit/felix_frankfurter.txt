it's
necessary
to
understand
your
case,
to
understand
what
--
what
a
marine
scotch
boiler
is
because
it's
sold
and
you'd
better
explain
that
these
--
one
ignoramus
to
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
just
--
do
they
--
do
the
statutes
or
regulations
specifically
call
for
inspection
of
boilers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
specifically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
take
that
you
will
argue
that
unsafe
is
not
restricted
to
safety
for
purposes
of
functioning
as
a
boiler.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
doesn't
argue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
with
this,
“and
use
this
boiler.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
do
the
--
do
the
examinations
both
by
the
coast
guard
and
by
the
bureau
of
customs,
they
make
separate
examinations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
does
the
coast
guard
inspect
locally
then
it
inspect
--
it
inspects
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
either
in
detroit
or
wherever
your
boat
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
a
--
it's
a
physical
inspection
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
not
a
--
and
not
passing
on
--
on
a
written
application?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
coast
guard
division
of
whatever
it's
called,
is
there
a--
coast
guard
stationed
in
detroit
or
in
the
detroit
river?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
local
people
examine
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
sure
to
--
i
assume
it's
in
good
faith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
somebody
who
lives
in
detroit,
knows
about
detroit
ordinances,
doesn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short
of
the
--
short
of
it
--
short
of
your
case
is,
isn't
it?
you've
got
a
license
to
use
a
vessel
with
a
particular
equipment,
if
you
have
to
supply
--
if
you
have
to
obey
the
ordinance
of
detroit,
you
couldn't
use
your
vessel
with
the
equipment.
you
say
you
got
a
license
from
uncle
sam
to
use
that
equipment
and
that
license
is
controlling.
and
therefore,
the
question
is
whether
impliedly,
there
is
power
in
the
state
and
this
is
what
it
gets
down
to,
to
make
regulation
which,
in
and
of
itself
is
enough
--
is
a
--
a
regulation
that
the
state
may
make
for
itself
in
welfare.
that's
the
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
also,
we
first
have
to
determine
if
the
federal
license
really
license
you
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
it
says
you
may
use
this
vessel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we,
the
united
states
having
superior
power
to
say,
“go
ahead
and
use
this
vessel
no
matter
what
anybody
says
about
it
because
we're
the
boss.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
other
suggestion
is
that
their
implications
to
that
--
that
license.
may
i
ask
you
--
i
do
have
a
curiosity
of
what
the
chief
justice
said
about
the
second
license,
the
customs.
i
take
it
--
am
--
am
i
right
in
inferring
if
it
is
the
coast
guard,
even
though
the
calling
pass
must
of
the
coast
guard
when
they
issued
your
license.
the
bureau
of
customs
doesn't
automatically
have
to
give
you
its
license,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
help
is
the
customs
charged
with?
in
the
first
place,
you
can't
use
your
vessel
if
you're
not
a
--
with
this
coast
guard's
traffic,
isn't
it?
under
the
coast
guard's
traffic
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
it's
only
--
it's
confined
to
american
citizens.
i
suppose
the
coast
--
customs
are
concerned
with
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
to
ascertain
that.
do
they
get
any
revenue?
do
--
do
you
pay
by
tonnage
or
whatnot
for
getting
this
license?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
where
is
the
license
of
the
coast
guard?
is
that
printed
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
(inaudible)
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
38.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
they
say
--
do
they
merely
certify
that
your
equipment
is
safe
or
do
they
specifically
certify
that
you
may
use
this
vessel,
which?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
they
--
they
--
whatever
this
is
worth,
it's
an
authorization
for
the
vessel
and
not
a
certification
of
its
safety.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
different
as
to
--
which
is
different
from
requirement
of
speed
for
safety,
because
although
this
local
law
may
cut
down
your
speed,
you
still
can
use
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
don't
say
you
may
use
the
vessel
that
can
only
--
that
you
may
use
this
vessel
at
any
speed.
they
say
you
may
use
this
vessel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
not
two
steps,
if
i
may
say
so.
it's
because
the
license
--
your
argument
is,
is
because
the
license
came
out
the
federal
statute
and
the
license
has
particularity
as
to
what
you're
authorized
to
do,
that
therefore,
there
is
preemption.
it
isn't
that
you
have
a
license
and
preemption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
preemption
derives
from
the
license,
unless
the
statute
itself,
preempts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
sure
--
are
you
sure
that
the
coast
guard
wouldn't,
in
the
license,
say
subject
to
the
regulations,
if
there
were
regulations
and
whatever
health
measures,
the
city
--
the
--
the
port
of
arrival
may
impose,
couldn't
they
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
nothing
that
denies
it,
but
couldn't
they
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
we
haven't
got
that
case
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we'd
have
a
very
different
case,
i
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
if
statute
doesn't
--
what
other
pieces
of
writing
didn't
[laughs]
--
all
includes
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
in
hill
against
florida,
the
act
of
congress
couldn't
say
that
someone
who's
been
convicted
of
a
crime
can't
be
a
union
official,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
far
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
on
that
act
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
given
earlier
the
practical
difference.
you
can
slow
a
vessel
and
it
can
still
go.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
vessel,
as
equipped,
can't
go
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
obey
the
ordinance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
know
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
tell
you?
did
they
tell
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you're
not
right.
but
i
just
wondered
how
you
know
what
they
intended
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
when
they
don't
intend
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
say
--
do
they
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
court
has
held
several
times
that
although
an
act
of
congress
does
not
cover
the
subject
matter
of
the
statement
legislation,
congress
meant
that
to
be
free
of
anything,
but
federal
legislation
and
in
the
(inaudible)
the
reason
they
found
it,
it
doesn't
mean
to
regulate
the
boats.
you've
said
that
again
and
again.
you
don't
have
to
have
--
that
you
can't
--
that
the
state
isn't
free
to
regulate
as
to
subject
matters
not
included
within,
the
legislation
of
congress
has
that.
this
court
has
said
that
again
and
again.
if
the
congress
intended,
could
anyone
fairly
say
from
reading
the
legislation
or
the
legislative
history
that
(inaudible)
not
to
prohibit
(inaudible)
of
becoming
union
officials
and
yet
this
court
held
that
is
to
be
implied.
i
didn't
mean
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
all
i
can
say
is
that
these
are
the
only
set
of
questions
for
both
or
you
suggest
the

justice

does
that
merely
infer
(inaudible)
but
on
this
--
also
the
local

an
actual
grant
of
(inaudible)
solution.
justice

60
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
60%
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
sorry
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
size
of
a
figure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hathaway,
could
the
coast
guard
decline
to
issue
a
certificate
for
a
ship
or
the
vessel
equipped
that
this
one
was
with
the
scotch.
it
is
scotch
because
they're
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
could
they
--
could
they
decline
to
issue
a
certificate,
a
license
for
a
vessel
thus
equipped
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
coast
guard?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes,
just
a
second.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
may
--
he
may
lessen
that
efficiently
for
detroit.
but
you
indicated
a
minute
ago
that
los
angeles
has
the
steepest
standards
made
the
equipment
which
would
lessen
it
sufficiently
with
detroit,
not
be
so
--
not
be
potentially
sufficient
to
lessen
that
for
los
angeles.
justice
felix

directing
on
people.
justice

i
thought
you
said
that
(voice

--
justice

(voice

--
justice

has
done
more
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
anyhow,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
to
have
misunderstood
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
could
they
--
could
they
put
in
an
instrument
or
an
equipment
that
would
satisfy
the
detroit
and
yet,
may
not
be
adequate
to
satisfy
some
other
cities?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
asking
i'm
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
bear
--
it
may
bear
on
--
it
may
bear
on
whether
congress
left
the
various
navigations
cities
--
navigable
cities
to
which
come
navigation
--
to
which
come
navigation
free
to
make
their
individual
regulation.
it
bears
on
that
question,
not
on
the
commerce
clause
as
such,
but
on
the
fact
that
congress
didn't
leave
it
to
the
potentiality
of
the
commerce
clause.
there's
a
potential
basis
for
adjudication,
but
that
has
passed
specific
legislation
and
authorized
the
granting
of
a
specific
license
which
is
the
immediate
part.
i
don't
think
the
commerce
clause
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
my
point
of
view,
was
argued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
its
unqualified
license
that
you
can
go
ahead
and
navigate
this
vessel.
and
this
vessel
is
the
vessel
as
equipped.
it
didn't
say
you
satisfy
the
federal
standard.
we
hereby
license
you
to
employ
a
useful
navigation
that
is
special.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
i
do
--
if
i
do
understand,
then
you
tell
i
must
leave
appellant's
argument
that
this
vessel
could
not
be
employed
in
navigation
without
violating
the
penal
--
without
coming
within
the
penal
sanctions
of
detroit,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
must
violate
the
emission
standard,
if
he
uses
the
vessel
in
coming
into
detroit,
is
that
right
with
the
person
to
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
i'm
asking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
very
important
at
least
for
me
whether
you
agree
or
disagree
on
that,
because
if
you
can
carry
out
the
license
that
he
--
that
the
certificate
gives
him,
and
complies
with
the
ordinance,
there's
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
can,
as
a
physical
fact,
use
the
vessel
which
was
certificated
for
use,
then
just
as
you
don't
require
him
to
--
what
to
do
in
order
to
comply
with
the
ordinance,
so
this
certificate
didn't
say
whether
he
could
use
this
vessel
with
or
without
compliance,
it
says
you
can
use
this
vessel
as
indicated.
so
that
one
argument
is
as
good
as
the
other.
and
since
you
got
a
clash
between
local
law
and
federal
law,
you
got
a
problem
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
congress
say
--
could
congress
say
“we
think
this
is
a
subject
matter
that
calls
for
uniformed
legislation
and
we
don't
want
the
states
to
consult
their
individual
notions
of
what
is
required
as
part
of
the
1955
appropriation
act.”
would
that
make
a
difference
with
--
with
--
would
your
answer
be
different
about
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
they
--
could
they
say
“we
want
the
states
to
keep
hands-off,”
to
answer
to
justice
clark
that
they
could
affirmatively
authorize?
they
could
--
you
said
they
(inaudible)
to
the
national
anti
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
pollution
statute,
could
they
say
“we
--
we
want
a
national
non-antipollution
situation,”
could
they
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
would
have
to
affect
local
matters.
you
can't
help
affecting
local
matters
because
that's
the
real
problem.
there's
--
there's
both
the
local
and
important
or
local
interest
and
also
national
interest.
