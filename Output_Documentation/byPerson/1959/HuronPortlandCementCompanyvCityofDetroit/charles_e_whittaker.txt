justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
this
hand
--
hand-fired
scotch
marine
has
more
smoke,
that
is
emphasized.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
is
that
the
--
the
only
authority
for
safety
on
stevedoring
purposes
or
is
it
also
for
air
pollution.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
lindbloom,
if
michigan
might
say
at
one
of
these
vessels
as
it
passed
through
the
detroit
river
should
not
exceed
five
knots
per
hour.
would
that
be
in
light
of
these
licenses,
these
federal
licenses
beyond
the
state
power?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
sir?
do
we
have
here
any
question
of
territorial
jurisdictions?
in
other
words
is
lake
erie
within
the
city
limits
of
detroit?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
where
you
offend
the
claim,
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
think
this
is
good,
isn't
it,
that
the
congress
decided
about
it,
but
authorized
the
commissioner
on
transport
regulations
and
the
commission
has
never
passed
any
such
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
we
have
just
the
matter
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
i
understand
you,
if
i
may
ask
again.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
question,
that
page
21
specifies
the
type
of
boiler
and
fuel
that
you
must
use?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
the
words
with
“may?”
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
that
sense,
that
is
non-applicable?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
your
point
--
and
my
point
is
that
as
i
understand
it,
that
you
would
have
this
certificate
to
get
license
for
a
period
of
a
year.
and
your
argument
then
follows
that
you
don't
have
to
get
another
so
long
as
--
as
this
one's
good.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
right
on
that
point,
isn't
that
the
boiler
instruction
act,
more
specific
to
the
question
involved
in
the
napier
case,
that
is
that
law
which
distract
in
pertinent
instruction
by
the
coast
guard
as
applied
to
inland
vessels?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
but
was
not
the
boiler
inspection
act
involves,
i
understand,
the
navy?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
to
what
must
be
contained
on
that
engine?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
the
state
sought
to
require
something
efficient?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
they
haven't
done
so.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
not
that
they
have
not
--
not
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
done
so.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
the
state
--
would
the
city
of
detroit
have
the
right
by
ordinance
to
exclude
this
licensed
vessel
from
carrying
deceased
persons
in
the
city
limits?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
that
would
be
requiring
you
change
of
structure
as
you
answered
in
answer
to
my
argument
about
going
slower
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
what's
the
difference
between
that
power
and
the
power
to
stop
the
spread
of
gases
and
smokes
that
might
cause
disease?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
caused
to
wonder
how
consistent
you
have
been
in
--
in
applying
this
ordinance
to
the
shipowners,
if
60%
of
them
still
are
not
able,
under
certain
conditions,
to
apply
--
to
comply.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
you're
arguing
that
starts
somewhere.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
--
are
you
arguing
thus
that
the
fact
that
congress
appropriated
this
money
for
state
use
in
eliminating
air
pollution,
is
to
be
waived
in
construing
the
effect
of
the
coast
guards'
license
here
as
not
covering
the
question
of
air
pollution,
as
leaving
that
matter
free
to
the
city,
is
that
what
you
argue?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
do
they
relate
it
in
any
way
to
a
--
a
shipping
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
by
sea
or
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
--
just
was
a
matter
of
practice,
i'd
like
to
know,
does
cleveland
and
toledo
right
there
your
neighbors,
do
they
have
the
same
ordinances
you
have?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
cleveland
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
isn't
detroit's
position
that
they
all
suffer
--
all
ships
on
the
great
lakes
licensed
twice,
must
meet
the
toughest
ordinance
that
any
city
on
the
lakes
may
have?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
is
there
power
in
any
commission
now
for
the
coast
guard
or
anybody
else
to
prescribe
smoke
standards
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
that
you
know
of?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
make
any
differentiation
out
there
as
to
whether
this
is
a
foreign
ship,
a
canadian
ship
or
an
american
ship
or
do
you
treat
them
all
alike?
how
do
you
do
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
does
canada
have
a
like
regulation
over
(inaudible)
as
yours
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
ordinance?
well,
then,
how
--
how
are
you
to
protect
yourself
when
smoke
from
a
canadian
--
on
the
canadian
side,
to
just
a
detriment
of
detroit
and
ask
if
the
ship
were
over
on
the
detroit
side,
which
is
a
narrow
river?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
maybe
what
i
asked
you
involved
so
--
it
is
just
a
curiosity.
