mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
(inaudible)
court
of
michigan.
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
affirmed
the
decree
of
the
trial
court
which
held
that
the
detroit's
smoke
ordinance
which
in
effect
provided
for
the
inspection
and
--
and
approval
of
boilers
on
--
on
appellant's
vessels
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
which
had
been
approved,
inspected
and
proved
and
licensed
by
the
federal
government
to
navigate
was
applicable
to
--
to
those
vessels.
and
also
that
the
penalty
provision
of
the
smoke
ordinance
which
could
not
be
complied
with,
with
the
boilers
which
had
been
approved,
inspected
and
licensed
by
the
federal
government.
the
appellant
claims
that
the
federal
government
by
its
boiler
or
by
its
inspection
laws
had
preempted
the
field
and
that
therefore
the
city
ordinance
could
not
validly
be
applied
to
the
vessels.
it
also
claimed
that
the
equipment
on
vessels
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
required
uniform
treatment.
and
that
the
ordinance
which
also
provided
for
inspection
and
approval
of
the
same
equipment
and
require
a
--
required
necessary
treatment
and
that
--
and
it
was
an
undue
burden
upon
interstate
commerce.
the
facts
are
that
this
appellant
has
a
mill
in
alpena,
michigan
and
has
a
fleet
of
six
vessels
which
--
with
which
it
transports
cement
from
its
mill
in
alpena
to
various
ports
on
the
great
lakes.
five
of
these
vessels
are
steam
vessels
and
they're
equipped
with
hand-fired
scotch
marine
boilers.
and
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
if
it
is,
it's
merely
a
boiler
in
which
you
put
in
the
fuel
and
the
fuel
heats
tubes
that
runs
over
the
fuel.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
right.
the
--
the
hand-fired
scotch
marine
boiler
is
the
grand
dad
of
the
boilers
used
on
the
vessels
and
it
--
it
as,
your
honor
--
as
your
honor
said
it
does
admit
more
smoke.
but
these
vessels
are
inspected
annually
at
the
time
and
bi-annually
now
by
the
united
states
coast
guard.
there,
the
vessels
are
inspected
and
the
(inaudible)
is
inspected.
and
after
this
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well,
sir,
i
can't
point
to
anything
in
the
statute
that
says
air
pollution.
no.
but
the
statute
says
that
if
the
broiler
is
for
any
reason
unsafe,
it
should
not
be
approved.
the
approval
says
it
shall
be
--
it
shall
be
approved
only
of
it's
safe
and
in
whole
in
part
or
if
it's
because
of
defective
design
or
defective
workmanship,
defect
of
material
or
for
any
other
reason
is
unsafe,
then
the
boiler
should
be
and
must
be
(inaudible)
that
purpose.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that
is
part
of
my
argument.
but
my
argument
is
more
than
that
because
i
--
after
the
federal
government
has
inspected
these
boilers,
found
them
safe
for
whatever
purpose
the
statute
requires,
it
issues
a
certificate,
which
certificate
also
contains
a
license.
and
that
--
that
license
is,
the
said
vessel
is
permitted
to
be
navigated
for
one
year
on
the
great
lakes.
now,
that
is
the
license
which
is
included
in
the
certificate
of
inspection.
then
there's
also
another
certificate
which
the
treasury
department
issues
and
that
at
the
bottom
of
it.
that
is
--
that
and
the
photostat
of
that
is
contained
in
the
transcript
for
the
record
following
page
42.
there
at
the
bottom
of
that,
there's
a
license.
“license
is
hereby
granted
for
the
said
vessel
to
be
employed
in
carrying
on
the
coasting
and
foreign
trade
for
one
year
from
the
date
hereof
but
no
longer.”
it
is
our
--
it
is
my
primary
contention
that
by
those
two
licenses,
the
federal
government
has
specifically
said
that
this
vessel
bearing
in
mind
that
the
first
license
describes
the
vessel,
describes
the
boiler
and
it
has
inspected
the
boilers,
says
that
this
vessel
maybe
used
to
navigate
the
great
lakes
for
one
year.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
would
doubt
if
it
were.
but
there
you
see,
there,
the
--
the
vessel
could
be
controlled
by
that
speed.
the
point
i'm
getting
to
here
is
that
this
smoke
ordinance
cannot
be
complied
with,
with
the
equipment
that
has
been
approved
and
licensed.if
--
if
in
your
honor's
question,
these
vessels
could
not
go
unless
--
it
could
not
go
at
a
speed
of
--
of
as
little
as
five
knots
an
hour
then
i
would
say
that
--
that
the
detroit
could
--
but
under
the
question,
they
could
comply
with
the
--
with
the
ordinance,
and
here,
they
can't.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
oh,
i
think
it
goes
back
for
many,
many
years
probably
the
1870
and
through
there.
i'm
picking
--
figure
out
the
year
but
it
is
old.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
oh,
yes.
yes.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
they
cannot.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
is
--
yes.
that's
a
finding
of
the
--
of
the
--
that
was
admitted
in
the
trial
and
it's
--
it's
a
finding
in
the
--
of
this.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
use
this
boiler.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
oh
i
--
that's
right.
it
can't
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
oh
no.
no,
no.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
we
--
we
could
put
in
--
we
could
put
in
other
--
we
could
put
in
another
boiler
or
we
could
put
in
an
underfeed
stoker
at
a
cost
of
$70,000
or
$80,000
and
--
or
we
could
put
in
oil
--
oil
burning
equipment
at
a
$100,000
withheld
which
--
with
which
we
could
probably
comply
with
the
present
detroit's
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
it's
a
question
of
cost
to
begin
with.
but
i
think
there's
more
than
that
because
i
think
there
is
this
question
of
preemption.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
the
--
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
by
--
by
passing
or
by
issuing
these
licenses
has
expressly
said
that
this
particular
vessel
may
be
used.
and
because
--
now
to
go
for
a
minute
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well,
if
you
mean
by
that,
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand.
if
you
mean
by
that
that
the
federal
government
expressly
say
that
ignoring
or
taking
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
--
a
consideration
of
the
detroit
ordinance?
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no.
i
mean
--
i
mean,
there's
nothing
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
not
expressly,
none.
none
expect
what
i
argued
a
moment
ago
that
--
where
they
said
that
the
boiler
is
unsafe
for
any
reason.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
think
to
answer
that
candidly,
i
have
to
say
there
isn't
anything.
and
this
--
the
detroit
smoke
ordinance,
first
--
first,
requires
an
inspection
of
any
equipment
that's
used
within
the
city
and
--
and
it
--
then
it
also
provides
that
if
a
boiler
emits
smoke
three
times
of
the
prohibited
time
within
any
12
months
period,
the
equipment
shall
be
sealed
and
the
seal
shall
--
shall
stand
unless
the
sea
commissioner
finds
that
there's
an
improvement
in
the
equipment.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no,
not
yet.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well,
it
can
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no,
no.
we
could
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that
it
--
its
criminal,
$100
fine
and
for
--
not
only
the
company
but
also
the
--
the
officers
on
the
boats
one
--
and
a
$100
fine,
30
days
in
jail
or
both
and
each
day's
violation
is
a
new
--
is
a
new
penalty.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
except
the
criminal.
they
started
the
criminal
proceedings.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
and
that,
they
started
the
criminal
proceedings,
they
issued
a
warrant
or
a
ticket
as
they
call
them,
against
the
company
and
against
the
officers
of
the
vessel.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
and
at
that
point,
we
filed
the
bill.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
and
we
allege
in
there
that
they're
going
to
enforce
the
ordinance
against
us,
and
the
city
says
in
effect,
they're
going
to
force
all,
it's
legally
applicable.
so
i
think
there's
a
fair
inference
that
they
will
enforce
the
--
enforce
the
whole
thing
which
it
requires
the
inspection
and
also
a
sealing
if
you
violate
the
ordinance
criminally
three
times
within
the
12
months
period.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no
this
was
the
--
this
(voice
overlap)
first
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
they
couldn't
but
i
mean
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
you
would
violate
it
more
than
three
times
within
a
year
because
as
i
say,
the
--
the
smoke
of
the
prohibited
kind
cannot
be
prevented
with
this
--
with
these
boilers.
our
problem
is
that
we
--
we
dock
at
detroit.
it
shows
one
of
these
vessels
docked
26
times,
we'll
say
the
other
one
22
times
in
a
year.
and
they're
there
for
about
16
hours
to
two
--
to
a
full
day
each
time.
and
every
four
hours,
they
have
to
rebuild
the
fire.
at
that
time
there's
smoke
of
the
prohibited
kind
is
apt
to
--
to
come
forth.
and
on
--
in
fact,
on
the
day
in
question,
they
were
charged,
each
ship,
with
violating
the
smoke
ordinance
for
--
from
between
nine
and
10
minutes.
and
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
building
a
new
fire,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that
i
am
not
sure,
i
think
it's
what
you
call
a
fire
tube.
but
i'm
not
wholly
positive.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well,
the
detroit
river,
yes,
which
is
a
connecting
river.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes
we're
tied
--
we
--
we
--
these
particular
offenses
that
we're
charged
with
occurred
when
we
were
tied
up
at
a
dock
in
the
detroit
river.
and
the
detroit
--
the
city
of
detroit
jurisdiction
extends
to
the
middle
of
the
river.
but
all
boats
using
--
engaged
in
the
great
lakes,
going
from
one
lake
to
the
other
must
--
must
use
the
detroit
river.
and
there's
apparently
about
250
vessels
on
the
great
lakes
are
in
the
same
predicament.
that
is
they're
equipped
with
hand-fired
scotch
marine
boilers.
and
as
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
trial
court
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
merely
held
that
there
--
there
was
no
preemption.
both
of
them
paid
no
attention
to
the
argument
concerning
the
licensing.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
gibbons
versus
ogden
where
a
license
is
granted,
no
one
else
can
say
that
this
license
can
be
used
only
on
certain
conditions.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i'm
not
too
sure
that
the
bureau
--
that
the
custom
makes
much
of
an
--
the
custom
issues
that
only
if
the
coast
guard
has
already
inspected.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
think
they
do
or
--
or
we
go
somewhere
where
they
ask
us
to.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
oh,
yes.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no,
your
honor,
they
--
it's
a
physical
examination.
as
matter
of
fact
they
sometime
tear
down
the
boilers.
periodically,
you
got
to
tear
down
the
boilers,
you
go
to
operate
them
when
they're
standing
there
watching
you.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
--
yes.
i
think
this
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
they're
--
they're
local
employees
of
the
--
yes,
on
the
--
on
page
41
of
the
transcript
or
i
mean
the
record.there,
the
commander,
mr.
hansen,
commander
of
the
united
states
coast
guard
is
--
is
stationed
at
detroit,
michigan.
and
i
think
in
there,
it
shows
that
the
boiler,
the
mountings
have
been
removed
at
certain
times
and
different
themes
like
that.
now,
it's
a
--
it's
a
good
faith
and
a
very
careful
examination.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no,
i
mean
it's
more
than
a
--
than
writ.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
would
assume
so.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
don't
think
so.
i
mean
i
think
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well,
it's
pertinent
in
this
respect
that
it
is
a
license.
that's
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
a
license
--
license
is
hereby
granted
for
the
said
vessel,
it's
naming
--
it
names
a
vessel
up
above
to
be
employed
in
carrying
on
the
coasting
and
foreign
trade
for
one
year
from
the
date
hereon
but
no
longer.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no.
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
under
a
statute,
that
license
does
not
issue
until
the
coast
guard
has
completed
their
license
and
approved
the
vessel.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
right.
nor
would
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
right.
i
mean
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
--
they're
both,
it's
--
it's
just
two
licenses.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no.
i
think
it
does
more
than
that.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
it
deal
--
it
deals
with
safety
in
this
respect
that
--
but
it
delegates
the
safety
function
to
the
united
states
coast
guard.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no,
because
under
the
statutes,
you
cannot
--
the
coast
--
the
--
the
custom
cannot
issue
that
certificate
until
after
the
vessel
has
been
approved
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
--
by
the
coast
guard.
(voice
overlap)
--
that's
the
only
connection.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
would
assume
that
is
right.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well,
that
i
--
i
mean
that
maybe
so,
your
honor.
i
mean
all
i
know
is
the
statute
says
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
“and
it
shall
not
issue
unless
and
until
the
coast
guard
issues
a
certificate.”
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
the
other
one
is
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
would
--
i
would
assume
that
but
i
think
it
seems
to
me
it
goes
--
might
go
a
little
bit
further.
if
the
federal
government
gives
a
license
that
--
leaving
out
--
leaving
out
the
--
the
preemption
that
the
federal
government
gives
a
license
to
use
this
vessel
on
navigable
water
can
the
city
come
along
and
say,
"well,
you
can
use
it
only
on
our
terms."
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that
i
don't
know.
as
practical
matter,
it
does
[laughs]
but
i
mean
they
couldn't
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
don't
know.
i
mean
i
--
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
little
different,
your
honor
for
the
--
for
one
reason
if
no
other
and
that
is
that
this
court
has
granted
much
greater
control
in
respect
to
highways
than
you
have
to
--
to
sea
water.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
our
case
is
much
closer
to
your
--
to
your
service
storage
and
transfer
versus
virginia
which
was
just
decided
a
short
time
ago.
or
that
company
had
a
--
a
certificate
from
the
icc
and
there,
virginia
found
that
it
picked
up
goods
and
delivered
goods
in
--
in
virginia
through
a
point
in
west
virginia
and
--
and
was
found
that
that
was
a
fraud
and
it
was
violating
the
intrastate
carrier
act
and
fined
it
for
$3500.
this
court
said
to
--
to
allow
that
fine
to
stand
would
be
the
same
thing
as
a
partial,
a
cancellation
of
the
federal
placements
of
the
certificate.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no.
but
like
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
think,
i
think
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no,
no
because
--
because
as
i
said,
our
vessels
can
with
the
equipment
as
approved
in
the
license
cannot
at
all
times
comply
with
the
ordinance.
if
--
you
see,
what
i
meant
was,
in
my
original
bill,
i
asked
that
this
--
that
the
city
be
enjoined
except
where
the
smoke
was
caused
by
our
negligence
or
the
improper
use
of
the
equipment.
i'm
--
i'm
claiming
it
only
where
this
--
only
where
this
--
offense
of
smoke
cannot
be
prohibited,
cannot
be
prevented
with
--
or
with
the
equipment
which
we
do
have.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
it's
--
it's
--
the
problem
is
whether
or
not
--
whether
or
the
state
--
the
city's
regulation
may
--
may
limit
the
federal
license.
i
mean
and
--
and
i'm
also
using
the
federal
license
as
--
as
indicating
preemption
of
the
field.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
right.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
right.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
probably.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
correct.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
would
think
not,
your
honor,
because
we
just
hold
for
ourselves.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
--
claiming
that
the
license
in
and
of
itself
was
(inaudible)
although
it
is
--
it
is
some
evidence
of
--
of
preemption.
congress,
in
respect
to
steamships
and
in
respect
to
vessels
on
navigable
waters,
it
passed
very
elaborate
regulations
as
this
court
said
in
kelly
versus
washington
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
--
you
said
provisions
with
respect
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
--
the
steam
vessels
are
extremely
detailed.
and
they
are.
they
provide
for
the
inspection
of
the
hull,
the
lifeboats,
the
equipment
on
the
vessels
not
only
the
boilers,
but
all
the
other
equipment
and
specify
the
number
of
crew
and
so
many
seamen,
so
many
pilots
and
so
many
mates
and
so
on.
they're
extremely
detailed
and
it
is
my
claim
that
by
those
acts,
congress
has
preempted
the
field
that
is
that
the
control,
the
inspection
and
approval
of
steamships.
therefore,
the
city
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
--
well,
i
mean
i
would
probably
have
to
say
safety.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
but
i
don't
think
that
the
point
of
view
makes
any
difference
if
they
preempted
--
if
they
preempted
the
entire
field
of
--
of
inspecting
and
approving
vessels
whether
--
whether
--
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
what
point
of
view
you
referred
to
as
this
court
said
in
napier
versus
atlantic
coast
guards,
they
say
hoarding
because
the
standard
set
by
--
by
the
commission,
that's
the
icc,
must
prevail.
requirements
of
the
state
are
precluded
however
commendable
or
however
different
their
purpose.
so,
it's
my
contention
that
congress
has
preempted
the
field
and
therefore,
the
city
cannot
come
along
and
say,
“here,
you
got
--
your
--
your
equipment
is
subject
to
inspection
and
approval
by
us,”
when
it's
already
been
inspected
and
approved
by
the
coast
guard.
and
as
to
the
penalty
provisions,
i
claim
that
inasmuch
as
the
penalty
provisions
can
only
be
--
can
only
be
complied
with
by
changing
your
equipment,
therefore,
they
are
specifying
the
kind
of
equipment
that
we
may
--
we
must
use.
in
other
words,
we
can
only
use
that
equipment
which
complies
with
the
detroit
ordinance.
and
keep
--
bearing
in
mind
that
congress
has
already
preempted
the
field
of
the
control
of
--
of
vessels
and
their
equipment.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
that's
that
photo
stamp
that's
attached
to
opposite
page
--
you
have
it
in
your
hand.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
oh,
the
coast
guard?
i'm
sorry.
the
coast
guard
starts
on
page
38.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
and
it
--
for
the
next
four
pages
--
or
next
three
pages.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
they
say
--
they
don't
say
it's
safe.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
down
in
the
bottom
of
page
39,
they
say
the
said
vessel
is
permitted
to
be
navigated
for
one
year
on
the
great
lakes.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
right.
and
it
is
my
contention
that
the
inspection
provisions,
in
respect
to
vessels,
are
as
broad
as
the
boiler
inspection
for
the
railroads.
and
this
court
in
napier
versus
atlantic
coast
guard
--
atlantic
coast
line
there,
two
states
came
along
and
wanted
some
additional
equipment
put
on,
put
on
the
--
the
locomotives.
this
automatic
door
and
a
cabin
curtain,
not
changing
the
equipment,
they're
putting
on
something
addition,
something
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
not
ordered.
and
this
court
said
that
the
congress
by
the
boiler
inspection
act
had
preempted
the
field.
i
claim
that
same
reasoning
is
true
here.
and
therefore,
those
two
state
statutes
were
invalid.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no.
no,
it
doesn't.
no,
no,
your
honor.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
--
again,
making
myself
clear
yet.
if
--
if
you
can
comply
with
the
local
police
regulations
with
the
vessel
as
licensed,
obviously,
they'd
have
to
comply
with
it.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes,
yes.
they
know
that.
they
have
approved
that.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
we
can
still
use
our
equipment.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
right.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well,
i
think
there's
this
distinction
as
a
--
as
a
point
--
i
mean,
i
think,
there's
this
distinction.
this
court
has
--
has
granted
the
states
much
greater
leeway
in
the
control
of
the
speed
and
the
safety
on
highways
and
you
--
you
frankly,
just
about
made
an
exception
as
to
--
to
highways
and
railway
express
versus
new
york.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well,
it's
more
than
just
putting
something
on.
it's
putting
in
an
entirely
different
boiler.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
think
--
i
think
there's
another
answer
to
your
honor's
question
that
has
slipped
me
for
a
moment.
i
think
this
court
has
found
under
the
--
under
the
motor
carrier
act
that
congress
has
not
preempted
the
field
as
to,
you
know,
size,
roads
and
--
and
control
of
the
highway.
i
think
they've
expressly
left
that
to
the
state.
i
think
that's
your
distinction.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well,
no.
no,
because
as
to
the
motor
vehicle,
i
think
congress
expressly
said
we
are
not,
we
are
not
taking
this
--
the
--
we're
not
taking
the
control
--
control
of
the
highways
away
from
the
local
authorities,
the
control
of
--
of
the
use
of
the
highways.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
probably
it.
i've
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
and
that
is
different
from
here.i
mean,
here,
i
grant
you
--
i
grant
you
the
--
the
federal
inspection
law,
do
not
use
the
word,
“smoke.”
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no,
no.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no,
that
we
may
--
i
think
here
--
i
think
he
said,
“may.”
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
oh,
yes.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
requirement,
but
then,
we
have
to
--
but
they
--
well,
i
mean,
yes
and
no.
what
i
mean
is
to
comply
with
these
particular
license,
we
have
to
use
this
--
this
vessel
because
that's
the
one
that's
approved.
i
mean
this
boiler,
because
that's
the
one
that's
approved.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
right.
i
mean
this
particular
certificate
that
we
--
we
have
to
use.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
in
that
sense,
yes,
but
i
--
there
is
no
doubt,
we
could
get
another
certificate
to
be
put
on
an
oil
burner.
i'm
not
(inaudible)
to
mislead
you.
now
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
--
that's
as
far
as
the
license
argument
go.
i'd
say
yes.
i
mean,
i'm
arguing
two
things.
one,
the
--
in
that
--
the
license
per
se
and
also
the
preemption
that
the
license
is
the
final
step
in
the
--
in
the
inspection
and
the
approval
of
all
the
equipment
and
therefore,
congress
has
preempted
the
entire
field
of
vessels
and
their
equipment.
do
i
make
myself
clear?
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well,
i
would
beg
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well,
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
statute
itself
preempts
by
the
completeness
of
its
control
of
the
vessels
and
their
equipment.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
authorizes
them
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well,
i
mean
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no,
i
think
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
i
think,
you
only
have
the
right
to
clear
what
--
what
statute
authorizes
them
to
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
now,
as
i
say
in
the
--
getting
back
to
this
napier
case
and
refers
to
the
atlantic
coast
lines,
there,
the
boiler
--
the
boiler
act,
it
was
held
--
preempted
the
appeal.
now,
to
get
to
this
license
for
just
one
minute
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i'm
not
quite
sure.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
apply
--
it
is
limited
to
inland
vessels.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
that
case
--
icc,
the
right
to
specify
what
should
be
on
the
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
and
they
haven't
done
so.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
not
done
so.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
the
way
i
understand
it.
now,
getting
to
this
license
business
for
just
a
minute,
as
i
said
earlier,
in
this
--
in
this
service
storage
and
transfer
case,
there
--
there
the
storage
company
was
charged
with
just
carrying
3%
of
its
freight
in
intrastate
and
they
were
fined
$3500,
and
this
court
held
that
to
have
sustained,
that
fine
would
be
tantamount
to
a
partial
cancelation
of
the
license.
it
seems
to
me
that
language
is
very
applicable
here
and
in
the
castle
versus
hayes
freight
line
case,
there
--
there,
the
freight
line
had
been
overloading
in
violation
of
the
state
law
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
state
had
the
right
to
pass
such
a
law
and
they
barred
--
the
state
barred
the
--
the
carrier
from
use
of
the
highway.
and
this
court
said,
“you
couldn't
do
that
because
they
have
a
federal
license
certificate
and
they
have
the
right
to
use
the
highway
even
though
they
have
violated
the
state
law.”
and
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
carrier
could
comply
with
the
state
law
with
the
equipment
of
which
he
has
had.
one
case,
it
wouldn't
have
to
carry
freight
from
virginia
to
virginia
and
the
other
one,
it
didn't
have
to
overload.
but
here,
we
have
--
here
we
have
a
different
thing
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
little
bit
of
language
from
hill
versus
florida
is
--
is
rather
applicable
to
our
situation
here.
there
you
--
there,
this
court
said
that
“but
here,
the
agent
has
been
enjoined
and
if
the
florida
law
is
valid,
he
could
be
found
guilty
of
a
contempt
of
doing
that
which
the
act
of
congress
permits
him
to
do.
here,
we
could
be
found
guilty
of
violating
the
--
violating
the
smoke
ordinance
when
congress
has
permitted
us
to
do
so.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
no.
or
you
what
--
this
court
held
that
that
was
the
--
the
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
--
freight
and
they
implied,
yes.
but
here,
we
have
--
here,
we
have
a
direct
statement
that
this
vessel
maybe
used.
then,
of
course,
my
second
argument
--
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well,
i
would
assume
so,
yes.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
right.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
well,
the
--
the
whole
difference
is
--
i
mean,
i'm
claiming
that
congress
and
by
the
--
by
the
vessel
inspection
acts
themselves
and
also
by
the
license,
have
preempted
the
field
to
the
extent
of
excluding
the
city.
that's
my
argument.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
yes.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
right.
mr.
alfred
e.
lindbloom
that's
right.
and
my
second
argument
is
that
the
commerce
clause
in
and
of
itself,
preempts
the
fields
where
uniformity
is
necessary.
i
claim,
i'm
talking
about
uniformity
of
equipment.
the
city
and
i
differ
as
to
what
should
be
uniformed.
they
talk
about
uniformity
of
smoke
control.
i
--
i
grant
you
that
that
doesn't
require
a
uniform
treatment.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
equipment
on
the
vessels
must
be
uniformed
and
i
point
to
morgan
versus
virginia
and
southern
pacific
versus
arizona,
kelly
versus
washington
and
friedman
versus
new
york.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
those
cases
all
hold
that
where
--
where
your
equipment
is
necessary,
in
the
constitutional
sense,
that
is
useful,
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
intended
that
requires
uniformity
and
therefore,
the
city
is
precluded
from
passing
an
ordinance
which
would
make
us
use
something
different
--
or
--
or
precludes
the
city
from
passing
an
ordinance
governing
that
--
the
equipment.
