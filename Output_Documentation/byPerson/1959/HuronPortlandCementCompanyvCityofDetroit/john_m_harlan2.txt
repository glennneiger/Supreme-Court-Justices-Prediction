how
old
is
this
federal

safety.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
preemption
--
your
preemption
argument
goes
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
every
time
that
the
coast
guard
licenses
a
vessel
to
operate
in
navigable
waters,
that
means
the
state
is
removed
from
any
kind
of
local
police
control.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
this
question,
sir,
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
in
order
to
equip
the
vessel,
so
as
to
comply
with
the
smoke
ordinance,
that
by
so
equipping
the
vessel
that
the
--
that
kind
of
equipment
will
run
afoul
with
some
federal
regulation
as
to
the
kind
of
equipment
the
vessel
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
must
have?
justice
john
m.
harlan
nothing
of
that
kind.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
not
be
able
to
comply.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
what
--
what's
the
smell?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what's
--
what
is
the
other
kind
of
equipment
in
contrast
to
the
scotch
boiler
that

have
to
be
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
installed
here
to
meet
--
justice
john
m.

m.
harlan
and

--
it
involves
some
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
expense,
naturally.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
does
that
that
appear?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
of
whether
--
you
say
60%
or
roughly
--
roughly
60%
of
these
ships
are
not
equipped
to
comply
with
the
--
with
the

and
in

in
your
brief,
the

this
federal
statute
as
quoted
in
the
