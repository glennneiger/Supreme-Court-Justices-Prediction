this
is
a

in
what
other

justice

justifications
i
suppose?
justice

justifications
by
the

with
some
dismissal
which

justice

mr.
groner,
would
this
disrupt
your
--
the
order
of
your
planned
argument
if
you
summarize
what
you
conceive
to
be
the
specific
facts
and
finding
in
this
case
that
you,
it
is
my
point
of
view
insisted
on
this
case,
just
were
considered.
i
was
talking
disruptive
stoppages
to
summarize
what
you
conceive
to
be
are
the
allowable
findings
in
this
case
of
what
is
done
by
the
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
making
your
challenge
to
the
board
bore
down
the
ground
that
there
are
no
findings
to
sustain
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
that
the
evidence
doesn't
warrant
the
findings
but
the
--
but
there
is
no
basis
for
making
a
judgment.
that's
what
no
findings
means
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
whether
or
not,
there's
a
refusal
to
bargain,
isn't
that
question
of
law
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
a
legal
doctrine,
is
it?
if
you
like
to
rule
against
the
security
that
the
security
is
discharged
with
the
principle,
it
isn't
of
that
order
to
lead
a
conclusion.
it's
essentially
a
determination
of
facts
on
a
particular
record.
did
they
or
did
they
not
in
good
faith
talk
across
the
table
with
a
view
of
reaching
at
a
conclusion?
i
don't
call
that
a
legal
--
a
legal
rule
or
a
legal
proposition
of
court.
that
the
warrant
of
evidence
may
make
a
legal
conclusion
in
any
basis
of
finding.
it's
all
on
these
bases
of
legal
conclusion.
this
isn't
a
question
of
law
really,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
in
what
sense
is
it
a
legal
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
--
(inaudible)
maybe
whether
we
argue
of
course
with
appearance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
tell
us
what
actually
was
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
repeating
what
you
said
a
minute
ago
about
not
utilizing
what
you
called
picketing
even
if
evidence
of
an
unfair
labor
--
not
an
honest
bargaining
attitude?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
think
that
that
--
it
to
be
construed
as
making
no
difference
whether
such
--
such
views
stand
by
itself
or
it's
part
of
conjure
of
number
of
factors
constituting
a
basis
for
judgment
by
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
all
--
after
all
--
despite
that
--
despite
that
in
another
connection,
in
connection
with
free
speech,
the
mere
--
the
mere
fact
that
words
they
use
does
not
preclude
consequences
in
connection
with
other
things,
does
it?
fully
apart
from
the
(inaudible)
to
promise
benefits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
is
not
only
that
expression
of
views
but
it
is
also
something
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
and
(inaudible)
that's
an
expression
of
views,
that's
why
the
words
were
used.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
you
make
any
distinction,
in
fact
your
argument
does,
between
the
application
of
8
(c)
where
words
are
used
in
and
of
themselves
as
such
without
any
--
without
any
combination
of
circumstances.
do
we
just
mean
that
it
can
be
taken
into
account,
although
it's
a
--
although
it's
part
of
a
general
plan
in
connection
with
other
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
commission
can't,
the
board
can't
find
it.
that's
your
view,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
of
itself.
the
whole
point,
as
i
read
it
on
the
board's
action,
is
a
combination
of
things,
of
things
they
set
forth
on
page
28
and
29
of
the
record.
there's
a
whole
enumeration
of
--
of
conduct,
of
items
in
conduct.
and
my
question
is
whether
it
makes
no
difference
whether
something
that
is
barred
from
being
--
from
having
legal
significance,
it
denies
summation
and
equally
barred
if
it's
part
in
the
--
part
of
larger
conflict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
the
board
must
say,
we
know
the
law,
we
are
familiar
with
8
(c),
this
is
not
an
8
(c)
case,
because
it
has
a
lot
of
concomitant
circumstances.
they
must
spell
that
out,
rather
than
spelling
out
what
they
did
and
thereby
showing,
they
don't
--
they
do
not
disrespect
8
(c).
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they
coupled
it
with
a
lot
of
other
items.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
don't
condemn
--
they
don't
condemn
if
it's
they
--
as
they
are
clear
to
this,
the
point
of
my
question,
they
don't
condemn
individual
items
in
its
content
and
isolation
on
individual
items.
the
problem
here
is
whether
they
may
take
all
the
things
they
enumerate
on
page
28
and
29,
the
paragraph
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
28.
whether
they
may
take
all
those
items
in
combination
and
use
justice
(inaudible)
suggestions.
you
can't
break
the
fagot
apart
into
separate
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
persist
in
severing,
picketing
as
a
thing
in
and
of
itself.
and
the
problem
as
i
see
it
is
that
before
the
board
is
whether
they
may
do
what
is
it
contemplates
in
the
concern
in
the
case.
that
an
isolated
act
may
be
lawful,
perfectly
lawful,
but
in
combination
it
may
constitute
a
conspiracy
in
the
totality
maybe
illegal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
per
se
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
per
se
of
what?
they
talked
about
activities
and
they
conclude
on
the
bottom
of
that
paragraph,
it
cannot
be
questioned
that
the
foregoing
activities,
that
the
whole
point
of
the
board
ruling
is
that
this
is
common
and
not
separate
isolated
items.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
are
right,
there
would
be
nothing
to
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
my
assumption,
i
suppose
if
anybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
entitled
to
speak
for
anybody
except
myself,
but
i
shouldn't
think
anybody
would
make
so
irrational
assumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
was
this
question
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
there
was
no
expertise.
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
we
have
here
experts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whereas
the
board
by
its
very
existence
represents
expertise
and
the
board
was
created
for
the
purpose
of
making
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
exercise
of
expertise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wouldn't
any
differences
to
that
argument
if
they
set
forth
and
elaborate
well
phrased
statements
of
why
they
have
special
capacities
in
view
of
business
that's
coming
before
them
and
has
come
before
them
of
finding
that
this
accumulation
of
argument
constitutes
is
a
--
is
a
manifestation
of
not
bargaining
in
good
faith.
so
that
--
that
wouldn't
make
a
difference
of
what
the
answer
you've
just
given
to
justice
whittaker.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
fact
this
was
an
expertise,
spelled
out
as
expertise,
is
immaterial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
lower
courts,
not
even
this
court
always
spells
out
and
define
particularities
to
ground
its
decision.
but
if
the
board
exist
and
was
created
for
the
purpose
of
passing
judgement
on
facts
in
their
significance,
i
still
insist
that
between
pages
28
and
29,
they've
spelled
the
conclusion
--
the
basis
for
their
conclusion
on
the
basis
of
god
knows
how
many
cases
come
before
us.
