justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
say
that
again,
i
don't
fairly
understand
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
you
say
that
congress
described
this
as
a
strike.
and
you
say
that
the
fact
that
they
do
this
is,
not
a
strike
and
therefore,
it
should
be
held
that
it
means
that
they
are
refusing
the
value
of
collective
bargaining.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
can
it
both
be
a
strike
and
non-strike?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
thought
you
said
it
came
within
the
definition?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
the
briggs-stratton
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
the
briggs-stratton,
which
i
don't
see
that
you've
registered
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
the
one
from
which
the
court
of
appeals
quoted?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
conduct
that
you
described
is
not
protected
by
the
act.
did
we
say
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
forbidden?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
--
you
say
that
in
common
sense,
the
whole
that
it
is
forbidden
if
you
attributed
to
the
fact
that
they're
not
bargaining
collections.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
are
seem
to
be
saying
is
congress
described
it
as
a
strike,
held
that
--
give
limit
to
the
strike
in
order
to
forbid
it
as
illegal.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
held
that
the
state
could
enter
that
field.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
you
say
that
--
would
we
have
to
overrule
that
case
if
you're
right,
because
they
would
invade
the
--
invade
that
the
use
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
state
did
what
this
court
held
during
that
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
would
resort
in
with
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
wouldn't
we
have
to
--
wouldn't
we
have
to
repudiate
the
case
and
have
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
that
be
to
a
state
of
law?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
that
make
the
dissent
that
was
written
the
law?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
just
spoke
--
you
just
spoke
insofar,
that's
it's
own
ruling.
you
told
that
they
can
now
forbid
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
although
it
was
protected
by
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
know
whether
the
board
called
the
attention
of
the
congress
to
this
--
up
and
against
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
--
the
definition
of
a
strike
change?
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
did
the
(inaudible)
makes
its
decision?
justice
john
m.
harlan
a
decision
of
this
kind.
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
was
this
act
last
amended?
justice
john
m.
harlan
any
other
amendment
--
any
other
amendment
since
the
briggs-stratton
rule?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
board
file
a
brief
amicus
in
the
automobile
workers
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
did
the
examiner
find?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
did
the
examiner
find?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying
as
i
understand
your
argument
is
that
the
board
could
not
have
enjoined
this
partial
strike
as
such
and
that
since
the
finding
of
bargaining
was
predicated
solely
upon
a
strike
of
this
nature,
which
it
could
not
have
enjoined,
it
derives
no
greater
power
by
calling
it
a
refusal
to
bargain,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
the
essence
of
what
you're
arguing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me.
are
we
going
to
say
--
are
we
going
to
say,
of
course,
the
authority
of
the
wisconsin
case
in
light
of
our
recent
decisions,
i
suppose
whether
that
case
should
come
up
now,
we
would
have
held
that
there
was
preemption
in
the
sense
that
it
was
for
the
board
and
for
instance
is
to
say
whether
this
was
within
the
realm
of
the
protected
or
prohibited
activity.
and
to
that
extent
the
holding
by
this
court
initially
in
wisconsin
is
a
matter
of
law
is
a
--
is
not
a
very
persuasive
authority
in
light
of
our
more
recent
cases,
isn't
that
true?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
would
not
agree
with
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
the
board
back
in
at
the
time
that
the
wisconsin
case
was
settled
if
garmon,
for
example
or
the
san
diego
case
would
been
a
law
might
have
concluded
at
that
time
that
it
did
have
jurisdiction
over
this.
and
that
would
be
effective
in
the
ultimate
determination
of
this
court
as
to
whether
it
was
entitled
to
say
that
or
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
is
that
law
as
determined
by
this
court
without
exposing
the
issue
first
to
the
expertise
of
the
board?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
law
in
that
sense.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying,
as
i
understand
with
this,
is
they
did
not
do
a
good
job
in
this
section?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
pursue
that
question
just
a
minute?
assuming
that
the
record
can
be
read
and
i'm
not
saying
that
it
can
be,
as
meaning
that
this
slowdown
was
simply
one
of
the
factors
that
the
board
took
into
account
in
holding
that
there
was
not
good
faith
bargaining.
what
would
be
your
position
then?
would
that
have
to
be
carved
out
from
its
determination
and
then
the
findings
or
views
in
light
of
the
other
factors
to
see
whether
they
were
sufficient
or
could
that
--
or
would
your
position
be
that
the
board
was
entitled
to
consider
the
partial
slowdown
as
one
factor
even
though
it
couldn't
have
acted,
it
made
the
finding
on
the
premise
that
it
was
the
sole
factor?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
said
that
--
i
said
that
assuming
that
the
record
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
could
be
viewed
that
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
on
my
hypothesis,
you
would
say
that
the
problem
we
then
have
would
be
to
read
out
of
the
record,
the
partial
strike
activities
and
then
would
say
whether
x
those
activities
there
was
enough
to
support
the
board
judgement,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
--
is
that
also
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page?
