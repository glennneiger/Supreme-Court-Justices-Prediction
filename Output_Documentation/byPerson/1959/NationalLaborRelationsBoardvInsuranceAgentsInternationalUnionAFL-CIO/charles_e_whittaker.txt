justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
in
your
brief?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
within
the
board
to
--
through
action
involving
maybe
they
are
charged
of
failure
to
bargain
collectively
simply
to
--
in
an
unfair
practice
during
an
order
a
union
to
(inaudible)
tactics
of
the
kind
we
have
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
not
the
correction
of
the
rules
in
auto
workers
case
to
say
that
that
would
be
a
matter
which
includes
state
jurisdiction,
except
through
the
means
of
stopping
of
this
type
of
unfair
practices.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please?
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
mr.
--
to
whether
of
the
briggs-stratton
auto
workers
case
stands
in
the
way
of
board
jurisdiction
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
may
i
ask
you.
when
considered
by
the
board
in
connection
with
a
claim
of
unfairness
or
refusal
to
bargain,
is
the
board
then
as
such
attempting
to
stop
or
prevent
harassing
tactics
or
is
it
merely
saying
that
such
does
not
comport
with
the
independent
duty
of
bargaining
in
good
faith?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
what
was
that
activity?
did
it
have
to
do
with
a
failure
to
bargain
in
good
faith,
in
that
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
as
i
understand
that
case
and
maybe
i
do
not
understand
it.
it
was
a
local
action
to
prohibit
obstructive
harassing
conduct
under
the
local
law
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
feature
of
bargaining
in
good
faith,
which
admittedly
would
have
to
be
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
would
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
this
solely
enaction
by
the
economic
power
or
a
combination
of
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
suppose,
for
example,
if
they
(inaudible)
in
this
office
to
the
injury
--
such
an
injury
(inaudible)
legal
question
then
referred,
what
had
the
state
to
enjoined
that
matter?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
likewise
the
board
itself
(inaudible)
question
of
refusal
to
bargain,
also
has
jurisdiction,
is
that
true?
