mr.
isaac
n.
groner
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
court.
respondents
plead
two
issues
in
this
case.
the
first,
whether
the
board
has
the
authority
under
the
statute
in
any
case
to
predicate
a
finding
of
refusal
to
bargain
on
the
type
of
economic
tactic
used
by
a
union.
respondent
believes
it
has
no
such
authority
whatsoever.
however,
should
that
question
be
answered
in
the
affirmative,
nevertheless,
a
second
question
is
reached,
whether
any
such
order
can
be
sustained
in
this
case.
turning
first
to
the
problem
of
law
as
to
whether
there
is
any
such
authority
in
any
case,
i
should
like
at
the
outset
to
emphasize
what
has
been
conceded
here
in
argument.
although
not
conceded
by
the
board
in
its
decision
or
apparently
in
its
consideration
of
the
case.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that's
--
just
that
to
what
was
done
by
union?
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
your
honor,
the
--
to
answer
that
question,
we
have
to
specify
what
the
board
did
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
fact.
the
only
fact
found
by
the
board
where
--
with
respect
to
the
activities.
now,
those
activities
were
primarily
the
not
selling
of
new
business.
they
included
also
picketing,
they
included
also
late
reporting,
and
they
included
certain
other
things.
now,
to
understand
what
that
means
your
honor,
we
feel
that
one
has
to
know
the
background
of
this
industry
and
this
employment.
those
facts
were
not
even
considered
by
the
board.
so
that
my
first
point
to
your
honor
is
that
in
this
case,
there
are
no
facts
found
by
the
board
to
sustain
any
such
order.
the
trial
examiner
however
did
consider
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
we
challenge
to
--
to
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
let
me
--
let
me
put
it
as
precisely
as
i
can.
we
challenge
the
finding
or
the
conclusion
of
the
board,
because
it
was
based
on
a
per
se
rationale
solely
on
the
finding
of
fact
that
certain
activities
have
taken
place.
now,
we
do
quarrel
of
what
some
of
the
findings
of
fact
as
to
what
the
activities
were.
but,
even
granting
that
those
activities
took
place,
we
say
to
your
honor
that
you
can
not
reach
from
that
solitary
finding
to
a
legal
conclusion
of
refusal
to
bargain.
you
have
to
know
what
the
employment
is,
you
have
to
know
what
the
industry
is,
you
have
to
know
something
about
the
relative
bargaining
position
of
the
parties,
you
have
to
know
something
about
the
history
of
the
particular
bargaining,
you
have
to
know
a
myriad
of
other
facts
what
might
enter
in
to
a
proper
finding
of
refusal
to
bargain,
none
of
which
the
board
considered.
now
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
because
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
is
a
legal
question
because
it
is
a
question
of
law
what
standard
to
apply.
you
asked
in
your
--
in
framing
your
question,
you
asked
and
i
think
absolutely
correctly
that
you
must,
it's
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
there
--
and
i
paraphrase
--
whether
there
has
been
talking
across
the
table
a
good
faith
desire
to
reach
agreement.
that
is
the
question
of
law,
whether
--
whether
that
is
the
appropriate
standard.
if
that
is
the
appropriate
standard,
there
is
nothing
further
in
this
case
because
that
is
conceded.
there
is
no
dispute.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
there
is
no
dispute
of
the
genuine
and
sincere
good
faith
desire
of
this
respondent
for
--
for
agreement.
there
is
no
dispute
that
it
met
with
the
representatives
of
the
company.
that
it
recognized
them,
that
it
discussed
the
issues
involved,
that
it
gave
every
appearance
in
the
words
of
the
board
counsel
at
the
hearing
of
give
and
take
bargain.
there's
no
dispute
as
to
that,
whatsoever.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
your
--
your
honor,
that
--
that
can
not
be
case
either
in
this
case.
i
--
i
agree
with
your
honor
in
the
generality
of
cases.
i
agree
100%
with
your
honor.
in
this
case,
however,
your
honor,
the
board
in
its
decision,
regardless
of
what
is
said
here
this
afternoon,
the
board
in
its
decision
said
expressly,
it
is
unnecessary
to
show
that
there
has
been
any
impact
of
the
so
called
harassing
tactics
on
the
bargaining,
so
that
they
were
not
at
all
concerned
and
expressly
moved
from
their
consideration
the
very
question
you
have
posed
as
to
whether
the
reality
at
the
bargaining
table
was
what
it
seemed
to
be.
they
said,
we're
not
concerned
with
that.
we
don't
care
whether
the
tactics
over
here
had
any
relationship
whatsoever
to
the
bargaining
over
there.
and
i
say
to
your
honor
that
that
means
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
that
is
a
concession,
the
concession
incidentally
was
made
at
the
hearing,
the
trial
examiner
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
we
had
bargained
in
good
faith
in
view
of
all
that.
it
is
as
though
the
board
had
found
that
we
had
in
fact
bargained
in
good
faith
but
that
there
can
not
be
good
faith
bargaining
in
theory
and
that
its
theory
was
more
important
from
the
fact
and
we
say
to
your
honors
that
that
is
really
what
has
taken
place
in
this
case.
there
is
the,
in
effect,
legislation
of
a
general
policy,
a
general
policy
expressly
rejected
by
the
congress,
legislation
of
a
general
policy
that
engagement
in
these
activities
is
to
be
considered
a
refusal
to
bargain.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
certainly,
your
honor.
if
--
if
i
may
do
that,
against
the
background
of
--
of
let
me
turn
--
let
me
turn
first
to
the
second
question.
assuming
that
in
some
case
such
an
order
is
possible,
which
we
do
not
concede,
is
it
possible
in
this
case?
now,
as
to
the
realities,
this
case
involves
bargaining
which
took
place
for
a
period
of
some
six
months.
the
parties
met
on
virtually
a
daily
basis.
there
is
no
question
as
to
they're
meeting
the
literal
requirements
of
section
8
(c)
that
section
that
mr.
manoli
first
referred
to
in
the
opening
minutes
of
his
argument
and
then
virtually
forgot
about.
all
this
is
a
matter
of
stipulation.
the
bargaining
proceeded
from
on
or
about
january
16,
1956
to
july
17,
1956.
the
existing
contract
expired
on
march
18.
the
existing
contract,
as
a
matter
of
agreement
between
the
parties,
had
in
the
no-strike
clause
expressly
barred
the
union
from
using
not
only
complete
strikes
within
the
word
strike,
but
also
mass
late
reporting,
mass
refusal
to
write
new
business,
picketing.
now,
the
respondent
did
not
engage
in
any
of
these
activities
during
the
light
of
the
contract.
this
bargaining
involved
debit
agents
no
other
category
of
employment.
there
is
no
relationship
whatsoever
or
virtually
none
between
the
job
of
a
debit
agent
and
that
of
the
factory
worker.
the
duty
of
the
debit
agent
is
to
collect,
to
sell
of
new
business,
to
services
existing
policy
holders.
the
debit
is
an
assigned
territory
or
a
group
of
policy
holders.
virtually,
all
of
the
so-called
working
time
of
the
agent
is
out
on
the
field
in
his
own
debit.
there
is
reporting
on
tuesday
and
friday
mornings
for
a
very
limited
time,
as
mr.
manoli
indicated,
and
for
a
very
limited
purpose.
the
duties
are
carried
out
in
the
field.
that
is
where
the
premiums
are
collected.
that
is
where
the
servicing
is
done.
that
is
where
the
new
business
is
sold.
now,
in
order
to
sell
new
business,
for
example,
you
have
to
talk
to
the
prospect
who
is
generally
the
head
of
the
family.
in
order
to
collect
premiums,
you
have
to
come
to
the
home
when
the
money
is
there
and
the
people
are
there.
in
order
to
perform
this
function,
therefore,
you
have
to
suit
the
convenience
of
your
client
and
policy
holders.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
set
working
time.
there
is
no
regular
working
day.
you
do
the
job
at
whatever
hour
is
convenient
and
possible
for
you
to
do
it.
there
is
no
set
prospect
of
working
time.
there
is
no
on-the-job
in
that
sense.
there
is
no
fixed
location
like
a
factory.
each
man
is
out
on
his
own
debit,
doing
his
own
job,
on
his
own
schedule.
and
this
is
conceded
as
a
matter
of
the
undisputed
evidence
and
the
undisputed
findings
of
fact
by
the
trial
examiner
which
the
board
did
not
controvert.
now,
the
emphasis,
in
other
words,
is
on
results.
in
effect,
the
company
doesn't
care
when
the
job
gets
done
so
long
as
it
gets
done.
and
that
emphasis
on
result
is
reflected
in
the
compensation
of
these
agents.
with
the
exception
of
a
payment
of
$4.50
a
week,
everything
they
get
is
on
a
commission
basis.
when
they
did
not
sell
new
business,
they
did
not
earn
any
new
business
commission.
now,
it
is
true
they
are
under
so
called
quarterly
systems
so
that
their
actual
earnings
were
thirteen
weeks
behind
the
actual
performance.
but,
they
never
made
up
what
they
lost
in
terms
of
not
selling
business.
in
terms
of
the
actual
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
no
reality
whatsoever
for
saying
that
there
is
no
pressure
upon
the
employees
or
upon
the
union.
the
not
writing
of
new
business
had
the
same
economic
impact
as
a
complete
strike.
there
was
nothing
earned
where
there
was
nothing
sold.
there
was
no
compensation
where
there
was
performance.
to
the
extent
that
there
was
compensation,
there
was
performance.
to
the
extent
that
there
was
a
collection
commission
earned,
there
were
collections
of
premiums
made.
now,
the
nature
of
this
industry
is
an
important
consideration
particularly
to
the
question
of
why
this
respondent
did
what
it
did
on
march
18.
and
let
met
backtrack
just
for
one
minute.
during
the
bargaining
had
developed
prior
to
march
18
that
there
was
one
particular
issue
which
brought
the
parties
apart.
and
that
remained
true
for
the
balance
of
the
period
after
march
18
when
the
work
without
a
contract
program
was
continued.
that
one
issue
was
a
demand
by
the
company
not
by
the
union.
it
was
a
demand
by
the
company
for
additional
contract
language
with
respect
to
unilateral
rights
over
a
debit,
over
cutting
a
debit.
your
honors
will
recall
that
i
said
that
a
debit
was
these
employees'
territory.
the
cutting
of
debit
had
the
direct
impact
of
cutting
the
collection
commission,
of
reducing
that
minimum
of
job
security
of
assured
income,
that
is
the
very
distinction
between
the
debit
agent
and
other
types
of
insurance
agents.
the
very
point
of
a
debit
system,
furthermore,
is
that
the
agent
gets
to
know
the
particular
people
he
regularly
visits
so
well
that
they
become
his
client
prospects
for
new
sales,
so
that
both
an
assured
income
and
a
potential
prospect,
the
company
was
seeking
a
unilateral
right
to
deprive
these
agents
of
fundamental
job
security
so
that
respondent
had
before
it
a
most
fundamental
issue.
so
that
as
of
march
18
when
the
contract
expired,
and
when
so
far
as
the
agreement
of
the
parties
is
concerned,
the
union
was
free
to
use
any
other
tactics
which
had
been
proscribed
in
the
agreement.
the
union
was
concerned
with
what
way
to
bring
the
most
effective
economic
pressure
because
of
this
vital
issue
of
a
nature
of
this
industry
is
completely
different
so
far
as
the
impact
on
the
employer
is
concerned
from
a
ritual
of
labor.
first
of
all,
if
the
agents
do
not
collect
and
no
--
and
the
policy
holder
does
not
pay
his
premium
in
--
in
some
other
way,
the
policy
will
lapse.
if
the
policy
lapses,
the
company
is
released
from
its
obligation
under
the
terms
of
that
policy
from
the
duty
to
pay
$10,000
upon
death
or
whatever
else
that's
involved
in
the
particular
insurance.
it
does
not
have
to
return
the
accumulated
premiums
which
have
been
paid.
so
that
as
a
matter
of
actual
reality,
the
net
effect
in
this
industry,
unique
among
industries,
is
that
a
withdrawal
of
labor
completely
results
in
income
to
the
company.
secondly,
there
is
pressure
on
the
consumer
in
this
industry
which
is
not
characteristic
of
the
consumer
in
any
other
industry.
where
a
physical
good
is
involved
and
a
labor
dispute
takes
place,
the
consumer
either
postpones
his
use
or
purchase
of
that
good
or
he
gets
a
substitute.
that
is
not
possible
in
the
case
of
insurance.
you
can
not
purchase
insurance,
for
example,
life
insurance
at
the
same
price
as
you
purchased
it
years
ago.
the
premium
has
gone
up.
furthermore,
because
of
changes
in
health,
you
may
not
be
able
to
get
the
insurance
at
any
price.
moreover,
that
policy
may
have
accumulated
values
in
terms
of
loan
or
extended
insurance
or
cash
values
which
will
be
sacrificed
if
the
insurance
is
not
maintained.
so
that
this
consumer
uniquely
--
uniquely
in
the
economic
picture
has
a
pressure,
direct
personal
pressure,
brought
against
him
to
continue
his
payments
to
the
company.
now,
if
that
is
true,
then
the
company
would
have
in
this
case
received
the
premiums
under
the
realities
of
this
case
and
not
been
obliged
to
pay
the
collection
commission
that
our
agents
not
collected
it
had
the
policy
holders
paid
it
by
mail
or
in
some
other
way
and
in
that
way
too,
the
employer
would
have
been
ahead
financially
and
have
reaped
that
much
of
an
economic
win
for.
those
are
the
realities
of
this
industry
of
the
actual
problem
confronting
this
respondent
as
of
march
18,
1956.
all
of
that
is
in
the
record.
none
of
it
is
--
was
considered
by
the
board.
the
board
approached
this
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
the
examiner,
for
example,
found
that
with
respect
to
the
writing
of
new
business
that
the
agents
received
no
commission.
he
found
that
the
agents
did
not
have
to
work
said
hours.
he
found
that
the
impact
on
the
employer
had
not
been
proved.
and
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
as
a
matter
of
find
--
finding,
he
found
that
there
had
been
no
impact
except
for
the
failure
to
write
new
business,
that
is
to
say
that
the
collection
work
and
the
servicing
work
continued
normally.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
of
march
18,
1956,
the
respondent
union
was
faced
with
this
situation.
the
bargaining
had
reached
an
impact
on
an
issue
which
posed
fundamental
issues
of
job
security
to
its
membership.
the
previous
contract
which
had
a
no-strike
clause
specifying
a
series
of
activities
barring
the
union
from
engaging
in
them
had
expired.
the
union
was
faced
with
the
alternative
either
of
capitulating
completely
to
the
company
on
this
fundamental
issue
or
of
taking
some
economic
pressure
action
against
the
company
to
decide
which
of
these
activities
specified
in
the
contract
was
most
effective
under
the
circumstances.
confronting
the
respondent
union
with
the
nature
of
the
employment
and
the
nature
of
this
industry,
which
i
discussed
yesterday,
which
are
unique
and
which
pose
difficult
problems
for
a
union
in
that,
there
is
direct
economic
benefit
to
the
company
to
the
employer
in
a
complete
strike
situation,
which
there
is
not
in
any
other
industry.
confronted
by
this
problem,
the
respondent
decided
to
embark
on
a
work
without
contract
program.
the
primary
ingredients
of
this
were
two.
there
were
other
ingredients
the
primary
ones
were
two.
one,
the
refusal
to
write
new
business
through
picketing.
first
of
all,
so
far
as
the
new
business
is
concerned,
as
we
noted
yesterday,
these
men
are
paid
on
a
commission
basis
entirely
so
--
so
far
as
new
business
is
concerned,
so
that
the
result
with
respect
to
the
new
business
was
exactly
the
same
as
a
complete
strike.
they
received
no
pay
for
what
they
did
not
do.
secondly,
as
to
the
picketing,
there
was
picketing
in
front
of
the
company
offices
two
or
three
days
a
week,
one
hour
a
day.
there
was
distribution
of
leaflets
during
that
time.
there
was
request
to
the
public
for
support
to
the
distribution
of
petition.
now
mr.
manoli
found
that
objectionable,
the
board
found
that
objectionable,
it
did
not
accord
the
picketing
any
special
treatment,
it
indiscriminately
lump
the
picketing
together
with
every
one
of
the
other
activities
under
what
it
regarded
as
harassing
activities
per
se
illegal.
now
i
would
say
to
your
honors
that
it
is
an
anomaly
that
picketing
should
be
considered
per
se
illegal.
it
is
not
merely
that
it
would
seem
obviously
to
be
protected
activity
under
section
7.
more
than
that,
section
8
(c)
of
the
act
gives
affirmative
express
recognition
to
the
public
expression
of
views,
to
the
public
solicitation
of
support,
and
a
glance
at
section
8
(c)
will
demonstrate
that
that
section
provides
the
cause
and
effect
that
congress
prohibited
the
board,
not
only
from
finding
any
expression
of
opinion
which
was
not
a
threat
or
a
promise
in
unfair
labor
practice,
but
also
from
regarding
any
such
expression
even
as
evidence
of
unfair
labor
practice.
now
the
nature
of
the
slogans
that
were
used
are
in
the
record,
it
seems
conceded
by
the
board,
and
it
is
plain
on
the
face
of
the
record
that
there
was
no
threat
or
promise
involved
in
any
of
the
slogans,
or
placards,
or
appeals
that
respondent
used.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
section
8
(c)
of
the
act,
your
honor,
provides
in
effect
that
any
expression
of
opinion,
which
is
not
a
threat
or
a
promise,
not
only
may
not
be
considered
an
unfair
labor
practice
but
may
not
be
taken
by
the
board
even
as
evidence
of
unfair
labor
practice.
it
may
not
be
considered
by
the
board
either
as
an
unfair
practice
itself
or
as
evidence
tending
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it's
in
the
brief,
printed
in
the
opposition
brief
that
we
filed,
pages
3
to
4,
and
i
shall
read
it
if
i
may.
these
are
the
congressional
words.
“the
expressing
of
any
views,
argument,
or
opinion,
or
the
dissemination
thereof
whether
in
rented
--
written,
printed,
graphic
or
visual
form
shall
not
constitute
or
be
evidence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
subchapter,
if
such
expression
contains
no
threat
of
reprisal
or
a
force
or
promise
of
benefits.”
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
believe
that
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
your
honor.
in
connection
other
than
labor
disputes
or
even
in
labor
disputes,
it
is
a
question
whether
the
words
used
are
a
signal
to
some
kind
of
action
or
that
--
that
certainly
is
an
indication,
might
be
an
indication
of
unfair
labor
practice.
well,
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
the
basis
of
that
kind
of
holding,
at
least
in
a
picketing
situation,
is
that
it
is
a
signal
to
action
rather
that
an
expression
of
view
and
no
such
finding
was
made
in
here.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes
indeed.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
you
honor
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
--
i
would
not
take
so
broader
view
and
i
need
not
take
so
broader
view
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
--
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
because
there
was
no
finding
by
the
board
that
the
picketing
was
considered
of
itself
to
any
effect
and
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
under
the
--
under
the
facts
of
this
record,
your
honor,
i
would
say
first
of
all,
that
the
board
made
no
such
finding
in
the
sense
of
recognizing
that
the
picketing
posed
a
problem
under
section
8
(c)
or
as
free
speech
or
any
unique
type
of
problem
whatsoever
which
would
suggest
at
least
to
me
that
they
saw
no
distinction
that
they
did
not
accord
any
recognition
to
section
8
(c).
had
they
said
we
recognized
that
the
picketing
is
a
different
activity
in
its
very
nature,
and
so
has
received
special
protection
from
the
congress
but
under
these
unique
fact
circumstances,
we
think
it
is
an
integral
part
of
a
total
pattern
of
conduct
then
we
would
have
a
different
problem.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
see
your
honor,
how
that
shows
that
they
do
not
disrespect
8
(c).
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
each
of
the
other
items
to
the
extent
there
is
a
rationale
as
to
why
the
board
condemned
them
and
i
repeat
what
i
indicated
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
i
do
not
see
how
your
honor
derived
that
question
from
this
record,
because
the
board
did
not
accord
any
separate
treatment
to
any
of
them.
the
board
in
the
end
ordered
us
not
to
use
all
of
them.
they
did
not
say,
you
may
not
use
this
so
long
as
they
are
used
combination.
they
said,
“you
may
not
bargain
if
you
use
any
of
these
of
weapons
including
the
picketing.”
and
in
view
of
that
total
picture,
and
in
view
also
your
honor
of
the
reasoning
or
rationale,
if
you
can
find
one
of
the
ultimate
board
decision.
i
suggest
to
your
honor,
that
however
applicable
that
rationale
may
be
to
the
other
elements,
the
other
activities
that
the
union
engaged
in.
they
are
not
applicable
to
the
picketing.
for
example,
assuming
and
we
certainly
do
not
concede
and
we'll
show
the
invalidity
of
the
assumption,
but
assuming
that
unprotected
activity
could
somehow
be
made
into
prohibitable
activity.
picketing
in
and
of
itself
could
not
be
unprotected
activity
whereas
the
other
activities
might
or
might
not
be.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
your
honor,
the
question
is
whether
the
board
approached
it.
the
board
actually
approached
it
in
its
decision
as
you
now
do.
i
am
not
passing
any
comment
on
what
the
decision
would
have
been
had
they
approached
it
as
you
do
now.
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
they
did
not.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
they
approached
this
case
on
a
per
se
basis
that
they
regarded.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
per
se
that
any
act,
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
you
are
deriving
that
conclusion,
if
i
may
suggest
with
all
respect
your
honor,
from
the
mere
use
of
the
plural
by
the
board.
i
see
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
board
so
approached
it.
i
see
every
evidence
that
the
board
said
to
itself,
"if
there
is
any
one
activity
which
we,
the
board,
regard
as
harassing,
we
will
per
se,
from
the
mere
fact
that
that
single
activity
has
taken
place
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
union
has
bargained
in
bad
faith.”
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion,
i
respectfully
suggest
to
your
honor
that
indicates
that
they
required
two
or
three
or
five
of
ten
activities
for
that
conclusion.
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
as
a
whole
and
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
any
one
activity
would
have
been
condemned
as
illegal
and
would
have
been
enjoined
as
the
effect
of
the
board
order.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
there
is
nothing
to
this
case,
you
honor.
i
am
right.
that
is
what
the
board
did.
what
they
did,
they
did
without
a
color
of
authority
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
possible
justification
for
it.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
there
is
nothing
to
this
case.
there
is
nothing
in
the
facts
which
support
this
board
order.
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
which
could
possibly
support
this
board
order.
and
i
do
not
welcome
the
assumption,
because
i
think
it's
fundamental
to
this
case
that
merely
because
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
brought
a
case
here
that
there
must
be
some
semblance
of
legal
plausibility
of
what
it
said.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
i
welcome
that
because
it's
certainly
not
my
assumption.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
further,
i
suggest
that
there
are
a
number
of
facts
which
i
have
been
reviewing
which
the
board
here
completely
overlooked,
which
they
would
have
mentioned
had
there
been
any
semblance
of
irrationality
in
their
approach.
they
did
not
mention
any
of
the
fact
to
which
i
adverted
yesterday
and
they
did
not
mention
any
of
the
facts
to
which
i
now
turn.
each
of
these
activities,
and
they
did,
to
some
minor
extent,
change
from
week
to
week.
each
of
these
activities
was
known
to
the
company
under
the
stipulation
of
counsel
and
the
finding
of
fact
not
contradicted
by
the
trial
examiner.
it
was
known
to
the
company
before
it
took
place,
so
that
the
company
had
the
opportunity
to
make
its
plans
on
the
basis
of
prior
knowledge.
if
your
honors
ask
me,
what
is
the
significance
of
that
fact?
i
say
to
your
honors,
that
the
board
in
its
brief
suggests
that
the
ability
of
the
employer
to
plan
accordingly
is
one
of
the
criteria,
which
distinguish
a
strike
which
they
would
concede
as
legal
from
a
strike
which
they
would
condemn
as
harassing
and
therefore
per
se
illegal,
so
that
we
have
satisfied
the
criterion
which
they
themselves
has
put
forward
in
their
brief
as
a
criterion
for
legal
activity.
the
board,
in
its
decision
--
and
there
are
many
differences
between
the
board
decision
and
the
board
brief.
the
board,
in
its
decision,
made
no
reference
to
this
fact
whatsoever
but
relied
on
a
number
of
two
cases
particularly
which
had
the
element
of
prior
notice
absent.
and
let
me
couple
before
i
get
to
those
cases.
another
attribute
of
this
record,
not
only
there
was
prior
notice
of
the
nature
of
the
activity,
but
it
is
undisputed
on
the
record
and
found
to
the
fact
by
the
trial
examiner,
and
not
reversed
by
the
board
that
the
company
did
know
precisely
what
concession
was
necessary
in
order
to
produce
the
termination
of
these
activities,
so
that
you
have
prior
notice,
you
have
knowledge
of
the
concession
required
to
bring
the
activity
to
an
end.
those
are
present
on
this
record,
they
were
absent
from
the
record
in
the
textile
workers
case,
which
was
cited
by
the
board
in
its
decision
in
this
case.
they
are
absent
from
the
record
in
the
automobile
workers
case,
which
was
cited
by
the
board
and
relied
out
here
in
the
argument
as
authority
at
least
for
the
not
protected
branch
of
the
argument,
so
that
you
have
those
two
distinctions
which
make
this
case,
in
effect
again,
satisfy
the
criteria
used
by
the
board
and
yet
condemned
as
per
se
illegal.
now
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
further
fact
which
distinguishes
this
case
from
both
of
those
and
that
is
that
both
in
the
auto
workers
court
--
case,
this
court
and
in
the
textile
workers
case,
the
board
found
as
a
fact
that
the
activities
of
the
union
had
had
substantial
economic
impact
upon
the
employer.
now,
in
his
argument
here,
mr.
manoli
has
put
that
forward
as
a
fact.
he
suggested
that
the
company
had
lost
many
millions
of
dollars.
there
is
no
support
for
that
record,
not
only
the
board
made
no
such
finding,
but
the
board
expressly
declared
that
such
a
finding
was
irrelevant,
it
declined
to
make
such
a
finding.
it
said
that
the
impact
of
these
activities
on
the
employer
was
irrelevant.
so
that
by
the
prior
notice,
the
knowledge
of
the
employer
of
the
concessions
required,
the
lack
of
a
finding
of
substantial
economic
impact,
we
have
clear-cut
distinctions
in
our
favor
from
the
cases
upon
which
the
board
relied.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
--
i
--
i
would
agree
with
mr.
manoli
that
that
case
must
be
overruled
if
the
judgment
below
is
to
be
reversed.
i
agree
with
when
i
take
it
the
concession
by
mr.
manoli
means
that
the
auto
workers
case
is
clear
and
unambiguous
holding
that
the
board
has
no
power
or
authority
to
prohibit
this
activity.
it
has
no
statutory
jurisdiction
to
govern
or
regulate
it
in
any
way.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
your
honor,
the
--
the
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith
is
not
in
our
view
in
that
sense,
independent
of
the
board's
power
to
find
that
there
has
been
refusal
to
bargain.
now,
what
i
mean
by
that
is
this,
that
the
only
thing
that
the
board
can
do,
should
it
find
refusal
to
bargain,
is
to
issue
a
cease-and-desist,
so
that
the
question,
was
there
bargaining
in
good
faith
within
the
statute,
is
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
exactly
the
same
as
the
question,
does
the
board
have
the
authority
to
prohibit
economic
activity
under
the
finding
of
refusal
to
bargain.
we
would
regard
it
as
exactly
the
same
and
therefore
precluded
by
the
auto
workers
decision.
and
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
the
court
reiterated
a
number
of
times
and
we
have
the
citations
and
quotations
at
pages
44
and
45
of
our
brief
that
this
was
its
holding
in
auto
workers.
it
said
in
number
of
different
ways.
the
board
has
no
authority
to
prohibit
or
regulate
this
activity.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
had
to
do
--
it
had
to
do
your
honor
with
the
obligations
of
a
union
to
an
employer
during
contract
negotiation.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
the
auto
workers
case
arose,
your
honor,
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
context.
that
is
to
say,
it
was
an
action
by
the
wisconsin
board
while
initiated
by
procedure
similar
to
the
federal
board,
but
in
the
end
an
action
by
the
wisconsin
board,
a
labor
relations
board
similar,
so
to
speak,
to
the
federal
board,
and
the
wisconsin
board
found
that
there
was
unfair
labor
practice
and
as
a
result
enjoined
the
activity.
now
it
is
true
your
honor
that
the
wisconsin
statute
does
not
set
up
refusal
to
bargain
in
bad
faith
in
so
many
words.
it
does,
however,
describe
the
activity,
that
is
to
say,
staying
on
the
premises
or
reducing
production
without
going
on
a
full
strike.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
it
and
--
and
the
--
i
was
--
perhaps
even
go
a
little
bit
further
but
that
--
that
would
--
that
is
our
position.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
the
essence
of
our
position.
i
would
say
even
further
that
the
specific
activities
involved
as
a
question
of
facts,
just
to
--
to
particularize
what
your
honor
has
just
stated,
that
the
particular
activities
involved
cannot
be
distinguished
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
the
question
whether
the
board
has
the
authority
to
prohibit
these
activities.
in
other
words,
what
the
union
did
actually
in
its
relationships
with
the
employer
is
similar,
so
to
speak,
except
for
the
differences
i've
just
enumerated
is
similar
to
what
the
union
did
here.
so
that
the
court,
this
court,
having
these
particular
activities
before
it,
had
the
legal
issue
could
the
state
of
wisconsin
enjoin
those
activities
or
could
it
not
do
so
because
the
right
and
power
to
enjoin
those
activities
had
been
preemptive
by
the
federal
board,
and
that
question
necessarily
and
was
recognized
by
the
court
as
including
any
and
all
possible
ways
by
which
the
federal
board
could
exercise
jurisdiction,
so
in
that
sense,
the
refusal
to
bargain
or
8
(c)
(2)
or
anything
else
was
necessarily
included.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
would
not
agree
with
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
would
agree
to
this
extent
that
if
i
--
if
i
understand.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
i
--
i
--
let
me
say,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
to
the
extent
that
you
postulate
that
the
auto
workers
case
had
not
been
deiced,
if
it
were
wiped
off
the
books
and
we
all
pretend
that
it
did
not
take
place,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors
that
that
cannot
be
--
cannot
be
done
and
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
however
the
court
arrive
at
its
conclusion
in
that
case,
that
conclusion
is
the
law
and
it
stands
in
the
way
of
any
contrary
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
is
the
law
in
that
sense.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
was
decided
in
1949
or
1948
that
winter,
the
october
term
1948.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
oh,
yes
indeed,
and
i
would
emphasize
to
your
honors
that
that
case
considered
the
taft-hartley
act
and
indeed
made
specific
reference
to
the
points
which
were
raised
yesterday
afternoon
by
mr.
manoli
in
terms
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
general
congressional
temper
and
all
those
things.
there
is
specific
reference
to
those
factors
in
the
decision.
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors
that
in
the
posture
of
this
case
that
it
makes
very
little
difference,
because
we
now
have
the
board
view
the
cases
before
the
court.
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors
that
there
was
no
expertise
in
this
decision,
however
much
or
little
as
might
be
in
other
board's
decision,
and
so
that
the
court
has
no
reason
in
any
event
to
reverse
what
is
a
clear
and
unambiguous
holding
cited
by
the
board
--
by
the
court
approvingly
many
times.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
what
i
mean
by
that
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
there's
no
doubt
about
that
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
what
i
mean
by
that
is
this.
that
the
statutory
intention
and
the
theory
of
the
administrative
law
at
least,
as
respondent
understands
it,
is
that
that
the
expertise
involved,
is
an
expertise
in
the
application
of
difficult
facts
to
establish
principles
of
law.
it
is
not
an
expertise
in
making
legislative
law
by
virtue
of
a
preconception,
a
policy
prejudgment
as
to
what
is
desirable
and
i
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
they
had
no
authority
to
do
what
they
did,
that
they
did
precisely
what
an
administrative
agency
should
no
do,
that
they
did
precisely
what
congress
prohibited
them
from
doing,
that
what
were
trying
to
do
was
to
enact
what
congress
had
specifically
rejected,
that
is
what
i
am
saying.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
regret
that
your
honor
misunderstood
the
way
i
tried
to
answer
your
question
and
i
shall
try
to
do
it
again.
i
am
not
quarrelling
nor
do
i
say
it
is
necessary
that
the
board
be
expressed
and
say
we
are
an
expert
agency,
do
we
have
experti
--
exercise
expertise
in
this
case.
i
am
saying
that
they
must
do
so,
in
fact
that
in
order
to
decide
whether
a
decision
reflects
expertise,
you
read
that
decision
and
bring
to
it
reasonable
analysis.
and
if
there
is,
in
fact,
no
refection
of
expert
knowledge,
of
expert
analysis
of
the
facts,
of
expert
knowledge
of
the
legislative
limitations
on
the
authority,
then
you
reach
the
conclusion
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
exercise
of
expertise,
although
the
board
is
an
expert
agency
and
although
in
case
after
cases
it
does
exercise
expertise.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
trust
your
honor
recognizes
that
we
do
not
believed
that
the
record
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
our
--
our
position
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
our
position
would
be,
and
it
might
depend
upon
the
particular
fact
circumstances,
but
our
position
would
be
that
the
board
may
not
regard
a
slowdown
or
the
type
of
economic
activity
used
by
a
union
as
evidence
of
refusal
to
bargain
in
bad
faith.
we
suggest
to
your
honor
that
the
boundary
of
refusal
to
bargain
--
refusal
to
bargain
as
set
forth
in
8
(b)
(3)
are
boundaries
which
pertain
to
the
genuiness
of
the
desire
to
reach
agreement,
are
boundaries
which
are
set
forth
in
8
(d)
with
respect
to
meeting
and
so
forth,
and
we
say
that
the
exercise
of
the
economic
power
has
no
bearing
upon
that
question,
has
no
more
bearing
in
this
case
then
it
would
have
as
the
union
engaged
in
a
complete
strike.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
--
i
was
--
in
getting
back
to
the
other
question,
i
would
suggest
that
that
depends
to
some
extent
on
what
the
board
said
it
was
doing.
now
if
the
board
made
such
a
view
point
possible
by
the
nature
of
its
decision,
for
example,
to
take
--
to
take
the
assumption.
if
the
board
had
said
flatly
in
the
case
we're
assuming,
we
rely
on
all
these
things
and
if
anyone
is
absent,
then
we
just
would
not
have
found
an
unfair
practice,
assuming
that
were
as
clearly
spelled
out,
then
there
would
be
no
occasion,
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor,
for
the
court
to
attempt
to
carve
out
any
exception,
but
absent
something
in
the
board
decision
which
would
preclude
the
court
from
doing
what
your
honor
has
suggested,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor.
and
i
would
say
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
approach,
there
was
in
fact
expressly
the
very
opposite
approach,
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
other
that,
the
economic
pressures
which
the
union
brought
that
it
is
precisely
the
theory
of
free
collective
bargaining
that
the
parties
are
free
to
use
such
pressures,
that
they
may
bring
substance
to
economic
pressure
to
bare
just
as
they
may
refuse
to
agree
to
a
substantive
term
or
stand
on
--
on
a
substantive
term,
in
terms
of
their
ultimate
position.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
was
an
amendment
your
honor
in
the
--
in
the
consideration
of
what
was
ultimately
section
8
(b)
(4)
it
appears
at
page
94
of
our
brief.
it
appears
also
your
honor
in
the
petition
for
reconsideration
in
the
refiled
by
the
board
as
amicus
in
the
auto
workers
case,
and
let
me
read
from
that.
we
believe,
these
are
the
words
of
the
board.
we
believe
that
the
refusal
of
congress
to
define
as
unfair
labor
practices
all
concerted
activities
which
the
board
might
find
unprotected
so
that
you
have
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes.
that
is
also
cited.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
believe
at
page
85.
it
is
in
the
third
sentence
on
page
85
your
honor.
i
cannot
find
spelled
out
in
the
board
decision
on
pages
28
or
29,
any
other,
any
sustainable
basis.
the
only
argument
which
is
plausible
on
those
pages
refers
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
conduct,
that
the
parties
must
approach
bargaining
with
reason
their
only
guide,
if
that
were
so,
then
a
complete
strike
could
be
outlawed
under
the
rationale
brought
to
this
decision
by
the
board
here.
and
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
is
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
there
is
no
reasonable
distinction
expert
or
otherwise
between
a
complete
and
partial
strike.
if
your
honor
sustained
the
board
decision
here,
you
will
be
sustaining
board
intrusion
and
collective
bargaining
on
the
basis
of
other
--
nothing
other
than
the
board
calling
something
harassing
or
unfair,
these
activities
were
harassing
so
as
the
complete
strike
harassing,
they
are
harassing
with
the
same
intention
and
purpose
namely
to
secure
the
type
of
agreements
which
the
union
wants.
there
is
no
distinction
which
can
be
drawn
on
this
record,
none
was
attempted
to
be
drawn
by
the
board
except
perhaps
on
the
unprotected
basis.
the
board
itself
in
1949
appealed
for
reconsideration
of
the
auto
workers
decision
on
the
protected
point,
it
did
not
contend
then
that
it
had
authority
under
section
8
(b)
(3)
to
reach
this
activity.
it
never
has
contented
that
the
exercise
of
economic
power
can
and
that
alone
be
made
the
basis
of
a
finding
for
refusal
to
bargain.
in
the
american
insurance
case
your
honor,
it
spelled
out
what
the
requirements
of
good
faith
bargaining
are.
the
summon
substance
of
that
requirement
is
wanting
an
agreement
in
good
faith,
so
long
as
the
terms
are
lawful,
so
long
as
the
pressures
are
not
otherwise
illegal,
that
is
bargaining
in
good
faith.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
violence
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
violence
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no
it
is
not
true
your
honor.
it
true
your
honor
that
the
board
might
enjoin
it,
it
is
true
your
honor
that
violence
and
violence
alone
is
an
exception,
it
is
--
this
court
had
spelled
that
out
as
an
exceptional
group
of
cases
where
concurrent
activity
by
the
state
and
by
the
board
is
permitted.
it
is
not
true,
we
suggest
to
your
honor,
that
violence
could
be
reach
by
8
(b)
(3).
your
honors
have
set
forth
in
a
number
of
cases
by
indirect
assumption,
the
board
itself
in
its
petition
for
rehearing
in
this
court
specified
that
violence
should
be
reached
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
i
have
those
pages
in
my
brief.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
violence
could
be
reached
by
8
(b)
(3).
that
in
any
event,
your
honor,
is
not
a
suggestion
of
a
trace
of
violence
or
physical
force
on
this
record
that
is
not
this
case
in
any
event.
thank
you.
