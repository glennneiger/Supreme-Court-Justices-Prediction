mr.

may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
national
labor
relations
act
imposes
upon
employers
and
unions
alike
the
duty
to
bargain
collectively.
the
statute
defines
this
duty
as
the
--
as
the
mutual
obligation
of
both
the
employer
and
the
representative
of
the
employees
to
bargain,
to
meet
and
confer
--
to
meet
and
confer
in
good
faith
concerning
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
and
to
reduce
to
writing
upon
request
any
agreement
which
it
may
arrive.
the
respondent
union
in
this
case
in
order
to
bring
pressure
to
bear
upon
the
employer
to
yield
to
its
bargaining
demands
engaged
in
a
program
under
which
the
employees
remained
on
the
job,
group
compensation,
but
refused
to
perform
important
functions
of
their
job.
there
can
be
no
question
i
think
that
by
engaging
in
these
activities,
the
employees
expose
themselves
to
discharge
without
recourse
to
the
protection
of
the
act.
the
question
which
we
have
here
is
whether
these
tactics
--
these
tactics
are
permissible
bargaining
technique
under
the
act
or
whether
a
union
which
engages
or
directs
the
employees
to
engage
in
such
activities
and
such
tactics
is
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain
in
good
faith
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
our
problem
can
be
summarized
quite
briefly,
the
respondent
union
has,
for
some
years,
represented
the
insurance
agents
of
the
prudential
insurance
company
throughout
the
country.
these
agents
who
number
many
thousands
are
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
insurance
for
the
company
and
also
servicing
its
policy
holders.
early
in
1956,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
covered
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
of
these
employees
was
about
to
terminate,
and
as
a
consequence,
the
company
and
the
union
entered
into
negotiations
for
the
purpose
of
arriving
at
a
new
agreement
to
succeed
the
one
which
was
about
to
expire.
after
approximately
two
months
of
negotiations,
the
company
and
the
union
had
failed
to
arrive
at
an
agreement.
and
at
that
time,
the
union
instituted
what
it
called
its
work
without
contract
program,
which
i
shall
describe
in
a
moment.
this
program
continued
at
the
same
time
that
there
negotiations
between
the
company
and
the
union
were
going
on.
it
continued
for
approximately
three
months
and
it
was
called
off
at
the
end
of
the
three
months
when
the
union
informed
its
membership
that
it
had
served
its
purpose.
and
shortly
thereafter,
the
company
and
the
union
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
this
--
under
this
so
called
work
without
contract
program
that
the
union
instituted
for
the
purpose
of
applying
pressure
to
the
company
to
yield
to
its
demands,
the
employees
refused
to
write
new
business.
the
writing
of
new
business,
new
insurance
policies
is
of
course
an
important
function
of
an
insurance
agent
and
of
course,
it's
also
an
important
aspect
of
any
insurance
company's
business.
and
during
this
period,
approximately
seven
weeks
in
duration,
during
the
period
that
the
employees
refused
to
write
new
business,
the
company's
business
--
new
business
dropped
many
millions
of
dollars.
at
the
end
of
approximately
two
months,
the
employees
resumed
--
resumed
writing
new
business
but
at
least
some
of
the
agents,
however,
refused
to
follow
the
procedures
which
the
company
had
adopted
for
the
orderly
processing
of
this
business.
normally,
the
agents
would
report
new
business
to
what
is
the
applications
therefore
to
their
district
manager.
but
under
the
work
without
contract
program,
the
agents
sent
these
reports
and
applications
directly
to
the
home
office.
now,
the
record
does
not
indicate
what
the
effect
of
this
departure
from
the
procedure
was,
but
i
suppose
there
was
--
it
may
have
resulted
in
some
amount
of
confusion
in
the
handling
--
in
the
handling
of
these
reports
and
applications.
now
in
addition,
under
this
work
without
contract
program,
the
employees
of
--
the
employees
were
directed
by
their
union
to
ignore
the
company's
working
rules
and
other
conditions
of
their
employment.
under
this
program,
the
employees
--
or
let
me
say
this.
normally,
the
employees
report
to
their
district
officers
twice
a
week
on
tuesdays
and
fridays
at
8:30
and
normally
they
leave
--
and
they
report
there
for
purposes
of
making
reports,
having
conferences,
getting
instructions
and
making
financial
accounts.
and
normally,
on
tuesdays,
they
leave
at
9:30
and
then
they
go
about
their
business
and
again
on
friday,
they
leave
at
about
11:30
and
then
they
go
about
their
business.
but
under
this
program,
however,
they
were
instructed
by
the
union
not
to
report
on
either
of
these
days
prior
to
10
o'clock.
and
then,
to
sit
in
the
office
and
do
as
the
union
described
it,
and
do
what
comes
naturally,
and
then
they
would
leave
in
a
body,
they
would
leave
at
a
body
at
12
o'clock.
the
further
aspects
of
this
program
which
the
union
conducted
also
required
the
employees
to
disregard
conferences
which
the
company
would
set
up.
the
company,
as
part
of
its
training
and
its
sales
program,
set
up
--
sets
up
conferences
with
the
various
agents.
and
under
the
program,
the
employees
refused
to
attend
any
of
these
conferences.
and
finally
--
finally,
as
part
of
this
program,
the
employees,
at
least
during
certain
hours
which
would
normally
be
regarded
as
their
working
time,
engaged
in
mass
demonstrations
before
the
various
company
officers
and
in
picketing
and
they
also
distributed
--
they
also
distributed
to
the
company's
policy
holders
petitions
for
their
signature
apparently
in
a
move
to
embarrass
the
company
in
which
the
policy
holders
would
urge
the
company
to
sign
a
fair
contract
with
its
district
agents.
the
union
explained
the
advantages
of
its
program
to
the
--
its
membership
in
this
fashion.
during
the
course
of
the
program,
the
union
wrote
to
its
membership
saying
that
the
alternative
to
the
union's
program
is
total
strike.
i'm
reading
from
page
105
of
the
record.
“the
alternative
to
the
union's
program
is
total
strike
or
accepting
the
company's
proposals
which
would
do
various
things.”
and
then,
that
letter
goes
on
to
say,
“it
is
inconceivable
that
any
member
of
the
union
is
willing
to
advocate
any
of
the
alternatives
in
preference
to
our
program.
while
it
is
true
that
carrying
out
the
program
has
its
price
in
sacrifice
and
inconvenience
in
the
light
of
the
alternatives,
the
price
is
small.”
and
again,
during
the
course
of
this
program,
the
union
had
adverted
to
another
advantage
of
the
program
as
compared
to
its
--
compared
to
the
conventional
strike
action.
the
union
wrote
to
its
membership
saying,
“you
know
that
the
company
is
unhappy
because
our
membership
are
able
to
draw
their
salaries
while
continuing
the
program.”
may
i
say
that
during
this
period
of
this
program
was
in
effect,
during
which
the
employees
were
refusing
to
perform
various
important
functions
of
their
employment,
they
were
drawing
--
they
were
drawing
compensation.
they
were
even
drawing
compensation
for
a
new
business
because
the
way
the
insurance
company
has
--
that
the
insurance
business
is
setup,
the
compensation
of
these
employees
is
based
upon
what
they
add
in
their
new
business,
or
the
collections
that
they
have
made
during
the
preceding
quarter.
and
eventually
of
course,
the
loss
of
commissions
with
respect
to
new
business
would
be
reflected
--
would
be
reflected
in
the
compensation
of
these
agents.
but
otherwise,
otherwise
they
were
drawing
their
normal
compensation.
now,
the
board
found
that
the
union
by
instigating
this
program,
these
tactics,
had
refused
to
bargain
in
good
faith
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
court
below
relying
upon
its
earlier
decision
in
the
textile
workers
union
case
which
involved
similar
activities
in
an
industrial
plant,
exonerated
the
union.
now,
the
critical
difference
i
think
between
the
board
on
the
one
hand
and
the
respondent
and
the
court
below
on
the
other
comes
down
i
believe
to
this,
the
court
below
as
well
as
the
respondent
union
equates
these
activities,
regard
these
activities
as
in
the
nature
of
partial
strikes
and
that
this
is
those
you
can
not
draw
as
of
the
inference
of
subjective
bad
faith
from
the
use
of
a
conventional
strike,
so
you
can
draw
none
from
the
use
of
these
tactics
in
this
case.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
these
destructive
on
the
job
pressures
can
not
be
equated
with
a
strike,
that
they
are
inconsistent
with
the
practice
and
procedures
of
collective
bargaining,
which
we
believe
are
embedded
in
the
statute.
and
that
because
of
that,
they
constituted
a
refusal
of
bargain
in
good
faith
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
question
your
honor.
now,
i
think
analysis
of
our
problem
begins
with
an
understanding
and
with
an
examination
of
the
practices
and
procedures
of
collective
bargaining
which
we
think
the
statute
contemplates.
as
this
court
has
observed,
the
statute
has
absorbed
the
philosophy
of
collective
bargaining
has
worked
out
in
the
labor
movement
in
this
country.
and
that
philosophy
is
incorporated
in
the
statute
under
the
rubric
to
bargain
collectively
in
good
faith.
now,
of
course,
the
duty
to
bargain
collectively
in
good
faith
presupposes
that
the
management
as
well
as
the
representative
of
the
employees
will
meet
and
confer
in
an
effort
to
iron
out
their
differences
and
to
arrive
in
an
agreement
through
the
process
of
negotiations.
however,
congress
realized
that
the
collective
bargaining
mechanism
would
not
function
properly
unless
they
were
available
to
both
parties'
economic
sanctions,
because
it's
fairly
obvious
that
the
one
party
or
the
other
can
not
either
support
its
own
demands
with
--
with
threat
of
economic
sanctions
or
resist
the
demands
of
the
other
with
similar
threats
that
the
--
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
will
be
worked
out
by
the
dictate
of
one
party
rather
than
through
the
process
of
collective
bargaining.
now,
on
the
employer's
side,
on
the
employer's
side,
the
economic
sanctions
which
are
available
to
him
are
in
the
final
analysis
the
fact
that
he
controls
his
business
and
that
he
controls
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
now,
on
the
employee
side,
on
the
employee
side,
their
economic
sanctions
lie
in
their
right
to
quit
work
and
to
go
out
on
strike.
now,
the
prospect
of
a
strike,
the
prospect
of
a
strike
plays
an
important
role
in
the
negotiations,
because
each
side
operates
with
an
awareness
of
how
far
it
can
go
in
the
--
in
the
course
of
the
negotiations
without
bringing
on
a
strike.
and
this
awareness
--
this
awareness
tempers
the
relationship
and
encourages
each
party
that
try
to
arrive
in
an
agreement
in
terms
of
--
in
the
spirit
of
give
and
take.
now
if
they
are
unable
to
arrive
with
that
agreement,
then
the
employees
have
their
traditional
and
their
classic
weapon
to
quit
working
and
to
go
out
on
strike.
now,
in
this
scheme
--
in
this
scheme,
the
strike
--
the
strike
weapon
is
an
essential
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
process
which
the
statute
incorporates.
and
this
we
think
--
this
we
think
is
the
practice
and
procedure
of
collective
bargaining
which
is
embedded
in
this
statute.
this
is
evidenced
i
believe
by
section
13
of
the
statute.
section
13
of
the
statute
provides
that
the
right
to
strike
shall
not
be
impaired
--
shall
not
be
impaired
or
diminished
except
as
specifically
provided
in
the
statute.
now,
in
a
statute
like
this
one
which
is
designed
to
encourage
industrial
peace,
it
would
almost
seem
like
an
anomaly
to
give
such
special
protection
to
the
right
to
strike.
and
yet,
in
the
long
run,
in
the
long
run,
the
strike
weapon
serves
the
basic
policies,
the
basic
purposes
of
the
statute,
industrial
peace
for
--
with
some
pretty
glaring
exceptions
that
i'm
sure
we're
all
familiar
with
as
today,
because
in
the
long
run,
and
generally,
in
the
long
run,
the
cost
of
the
strike
is
such
--
is
such
that
it
teaches
both
sides
to
compromise
their
differences.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
tactics
that
were
used
here.
these
tactics
in
our
judgment
certainly
do
not
occupy,
do
not
occupy
the
protected
--
the
privileged
position
that
the
strike
does
in
the
statute.
and
secondly,
they
do
not
serve
the
functions
of
--
of
carrying
out
the
basic
policies
of
the
statute.
these
activities
are
the
counterpart
of
the
industrial
slowdown,
the
intermittent
work
stoppage,
which
this
court
dealt
with
in
the
briggs
stratton
and
auto
workers
case
some
years
ago.
as
the
court
observed
in
that
case,
activities
of
this
kind
do
not
enjoy
the
protection
that
the
strike
does
under
the
act.
the
employees
who
are
engaged
in
these
activities
expose
themselves
to
discharge
without
recourse
to
the
protection
of
the
statute.
moreover,
although
these
tactics
have
not
been
completely
unknown,
they
have
not
been
regarded
as
character
--
as
a
characteristic
bargaining
technique
in
the
american
labor
movement.
indeed,
i
may
say
that
they
have
been
described
--
they
have
characterized
as
the
diseases
of
collective
bargaining
rather
than
of
its
nature
as
the
--
as
the
conventional
strike
is.
the
--
these
tactics
we
think
are
no
--
are
no
part
of
the
practice
and
procedures
of
collective
bargaining
which
congress
contemplated
no
part
of
the
practice
and
procedures
on
collective
bargaining
which
we
think
are
embedded
in
this
statute.
these
--
these
tactics
they
distort
--
they
distort
the
play
of
economic
forces
that
congress
contemplated
in
order
to
make
the
collective
bargaining
mechanism
function
properly.
the
--
these
--
these
tactics
are
designed
to
--
they're
designed
to,
in
the
sense
--
in
the
sense
to
compel
the
employer
to
subsidize
the
employees
who
are
unwilling
to
strike
and
yet
who
are
unwilling
to
perform
all
of
their
duties.
now,
of
course,
from
the
union's
standpoint,
from
the
union's
standpoint,
this
is
a
very
desirable
thing.
but
it
is
not
the
play
--
it
is
not
the
play
of
the
economic
forces
which
congress
contemplated
as
--
as
essential,
as
necessary
to
make
the
collective
bargaining
mechanism
function
properly.
the
conventional
strike
--
the
conventional
strike
puts
both
parties
under
some
substantial
restraint
to
come
to
--
to
hammer
out
--
to
hammer
out
an
agreement
in
the
spirit
of
give
and
take.
but,
as
this
court
has
noted
that
pressures
which
are
generated,
the
pressures
which
are
generated
by
these
disruptive
on-the-job
pressures
are
entirely
different.
they
permit
the
employees
to
stay
on
the
job,
to
receive
compensation
in
whole
or
at
least
in
part.
on
the
other
hand,
the
employer
has
to
operate
his
business
as
though
it
were
operating
in
its
normal
fashion.
and
the
consequence
is,
the
tendency
--
the
tendency
is
that
there
would
be
less
compulsion
upon
the
union
to
settle
except
upon
its
own
terms.
and
this
is
not
collective
bargaining.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
terms
--
the
term
strike
includes
activities
of
this
kind
your
honor.
but,
this
position
was
squarely
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
briggs-stratton
case
or
auto
workers'
case
and
it
was
rejected
on
the
basis
of
the
1947
legislative
history.
it
--
in
view
of
the
legislative
history,
it
is
inconceivable
your
--
i
submit,
and
as
the
court
itself
found
in
that
case,
it
is
inconceivable
that
congress
meant
to
bring
activities
of
this
type
within
the
definition
of
--
of
strike
for
the
purpose
--
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
them
under
section
13.
i
think
that
reading
the
statute
with
a
saving
grace
of
common
sense
that
the
reason
--
that
these
were
included,
these
tactics
were
included
within
the
definition
of
strikes
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
extending
to
them
the
protection
of
the
statute,
but
rather
to
bring
them
within
the
prohibition
of
the
statute
of
the
1947
amendments
against
secondary
strike
pressures.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
the
--
we
take
the
position
that
this
not
a
strike,
although
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
comes
within
the
literal
definition
of
the
term,
“strike”.
this
type
of
activity
is
included
within
the
statutory
definition
of
strike.
but,
i
am
--
and
i
am
saying
your
honor
that
this
argument
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
briggs-stratton
case.
that
although
it
is
within
the
statutory
definition
of
the
term
strike,
nevertheless,
it
was
not
intended
to
be
--
be
within
the
protection,
within
the
protection
of
the
act,
that
the
act
extends
to
strike
action.
and
the
court
held
that
in
view
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
amendments.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
the
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
relied
upon
that
case,
yes
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
upon
that
case.
they
relied
upon
that
case
for
a
somewhat
different
purpose,
however,
they
relied
on
to
--
in
support
of
the
position
that
the
--
that
the
board
was
powerless,
was
powerless
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
conduct.
and
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
briggs-stratton,
this
court
held
that
this
conduct
was
neither
protected
nor
forbidden.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
not
forbidden
by
--
by
the
federal
act
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
am
saying
your
honor
that
--
that
congress
included
this
type
of
activity
within
the
statutory
definition
of
the
strike
not
to
give
it
any
protection
under
the
act,
but
rather,
to
bring
it
within
the
prohibition
against
the
inducement
of
employees
to
engage
in
secondary
strike
pressures,
the
so
called
hot
cargo
provisions,
secondary
boycott
provisions
of
the
1947
amendments.
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
am
saying
exactly
that,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
exactly
that,
because
it
is
--
congress
made
perfectly
clear
the
1947
legislative
history,
as
i
say,
this
court
noted
in
the
briggs-stratton
case,
congress
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
it
did
not
intend,
it
did
not
intend
to
extend
the
protection
of
the
act
to
this
kind
of
activity
which
the
statute
accords
to
the
conventional
strike
weapon.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
court
held
that,
that's
right.
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
i
think
that
with
respect
to
the
second
phase
of
that
case
that
the
board
is
powerless
to
deal
with
its
conduct.
i
believe
that
this
court
itself
has
gone
pretty
far
towards
overruling
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
court
has
gone
--
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
i
might
suggest
that
only
recently,
this
court
had
occasion
to
mention
that
case
and
the
garmon
case,
where
it
said
that
the
approach
followed
in
that
case
has
not
been
generally
found,
which
i
take
to
be
a
sort
of
gentle
way
of
--
saying
that
--
out
of
their
way.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
it's
a
gentle
way
of
overruling
the
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
gentle.
but
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
insofar
as
that
case
held
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
not
all
of
it,
your
honor,
because
the
dissent
goes
farther
than
we
want
to
go.
[laughter]
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
it's
--
i
think
that
the
--
if
i
may
say
so
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
that
the
first
part
of
that
decision
with
all
due
respect
to
the
senators
is
show
good
law.
but
the
part
which
says
that
the
board
may
not
deal
with
this
kind
of
conduct.
i
believe
that
first
of
all,
there's
conceivable
doubt
that's
been
cast
upon
the
vitality
of
that
part
of
the
decision
and
in
any
of
that
--
in
any
of
that,
may
i
say
that
the
fact
that
this
kind
of
activity
is
not
specifically
prohibited
by
the
statute
does
not
mean
that
the
board
may
not
reach
it.
but
the
board
may
not
reach
it
within
a
--
within
a
bargaining
context.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
it
did
not
your
honor.
i
think
i
should
also
add
the
court
suggested
to
me.
the
court
did
say
that
the
board
was
powerless
to
deal
with
that
conduct.
now,
it
did
not
specifically
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
therefore
the
state
could.
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
conceivably,
that
state
--
the
state
might
have
some
kind
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
this
case
here.
i
don't
know.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
i
would
--
i
don't
want
--
i
am
--
the
--
the
force
of
my
argument
is
your
honor
that
the
board
may
deal
with
this
kind
of
conduct
and
that
the
state
perhaps
is
powerless
to
do
so.
but
--
it
may
well
be
--
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
problem
--
it
may
well
be
that
the
state
may
have
some
sort
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
this
thing
too.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
there
are
cases
of
violence
your
honor.
this
court
has
had
several
cases
in
the
last
couple
terms
that
were
dealing
with
violence,
laburnum,
russell,
gonzalez.
gonzalez
didn't
involve
a
violence
--
a
matter
of
violence.
but,
there
are
those
two
cases,
the
russel
case
in
which
there
was
violence
and
the
state
court
awarded
damages
and
there
was
also
the
laburnum
case
in
which
there
was
some
violence.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
damage
suits,
that's
right.
and
this
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
yes,
it
did.
the
board
had
jurisdiction
both
over
the
damage
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
no,
no.
over
the
conduct
of
practice
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
cease-and-desist
order,
not
over
the
damage
suit.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
with
one
of
these
--
the
board
has
reached
this
kind
of
conduct
only
through
the
8
(5)
through
the
refusal
of
bargain
--
unfair
labor
practice.
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
have
not
made
it
an
independent
--
an
unfair
labor
practice
so
the
board
has
not
regarded
it
as
an
unfair
practice
under
any
other
section
of
the
statute
other
than
in
a
context
of
a
refusal
to
bargain.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
court
did
say
that.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
--
i
think
it
comes
to
that,
your
honor.
it
comes
down
to
that.
now,
congress
has
not
particularized
the
duties
of
bargaining
collectively
in
the
statute.
it
has
left
this
largely
to
the
board
to
infuse
meaning
and
content
into
the
statutory
mandate.
in
other
words,
it
is
for
the
board.
it
is
for
the
board
to
lay
the
ground
rules,
to
lay
the
ground
rules
of
collective
bargaining
consistent
with
the
broader
chapters
of
this
statute
--
of
the
statute.
now,
congress
has
not
specifically
prohibit
this
kind
of
conduct,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
board
is
not,
by
that
token,
by
that
token
precluded,
precluded
from
concerning
this
kind
of
conduct
to
determine
whether
it
is
consistent,
whether
it
is
consistent
with
the
practice
and
procedures
of
collective
bargaining
which
i
would
say
we
think
are
embedded
in
the
--
in
the
statute.
now,
i've
already
called
attention
by
regard
as
the
significant
differences
between
this
type
of
activity
and
the
conventional
strike.
in
this
type
of
activity,
the
employees
are
not
entitled
of
the
protection
of
the
statute.
they
just
--
these
kinds
of
--
these
tactics
distort
the
play
of
economic
forces
that
congress
intended
to
have
operate
in
order
to
make
the
collective
bargaining
mechanism
work,
and
finally,
they
do
not
accord,
they
do
not
accord
with
the
mechanics
of
collective
bargaining
which
we
think
congress
had
in
mind.
but
more
than
this,
more
than
this,
there
is
legislative
evidence
to
indicate
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
compass
these
tactics
as
a
bargaining
--
as
a
bargaining
weapon.
when
the
1947
amendments
were
being
considered,
the
house
bill
--
the
house
bill
had
a
specific
provision
which
would
have
made
an
unfair
labor
practice
of
this
type
of
activity.
the
house
--
the
house
was
dissuaded
--
was
dissuaded
from
insisting
upon
its
position
only
when
it
was
assure
that
the
courts
had
held
that
this
kind
of
activity
was
outside
the
pail
of
the
protection
of
the
statute.
and
that
to
particularize
--
to
particularize
this
kind
of
conduct
as
unfair
labor
practice
might
have
a
very
limiting
effect
upon
the
board,
upon
the
board
in
dealing
with
this
type
of
activity.
and
it
was
this
legislative
history
which
prompted
this
court
in
the
jefferson
broadcasting
case
to
say
of
tactics
like
this
one
here,
like
these
here,
that
these
tactics
are
repugnant
--
repugnant
to
the
basic
policies
of
the
act.
now,
given
these
factors,
given
these
factors,
we
think
it
is
not
unreasonable
for
the
board
to
say
that
it
would
be
in
congress
--
that
it
would
be
in
congress
to
permit
these
activities
as
it
permits
--
as
a
bargaining
--
as
a
bargaining
weapon
under
the
act.
now,
the
argument
is
made
that
all
that
the
statute
requires
is
that
the
parties
meet
and
confer
in
good
faith,
and
that
judged
by
this
test,
judged
by
this
test,
the
negotiations
between
the
company
and
the
union
satisfy
the
statutory
obligation.
but
we
believe
that
the
duty
to
bargain
collectively
under
the
statute
involves
something
more
than
a
sincere
desire
to
reach
agreement,
that
that
duty
is
not
discharged,
is
not
satisfied
by
a
mere
showing
that
the
parties
have
met
and
have
sought
to
compose
their
differences
in
a
sincere
desire
to
reach
agreement.
we
think
that
the
duty
to
bargain
collectively
under
the
statute
also
embraces
a
duty
to
refrain
from
conduct
which
is
inconsistent
with
--
with
what
i've
called
for
lack
of
a
better
word,
with
the
mechanics
of
collective
bargaining
which
the
statute
contemplates.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
i
have
not.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
it
has
not.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
decision?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
first
case
of
this
kind
was
in
personal
products
case
which
was
decided
about
four
or
five
years
ago,
your
honor.
and
that
also
involved
a
similar
kind
of
activity
as
in
this
case
in
connection
with
--
with
the
bargaining
negotiations.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
year.
this
year,
the
labor
management
reform
act.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
only
with
respect
to
compliance
with
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h),
your
honor,
because
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
highland
park
decision,
highland
park
case
had
had
such
serious
repercussions
that
it
was
felt
necessary
to
give
some
room
in
the
legislation
to
meet
the
problem
to
which
they
were
created
by
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing,
your
honor.
we
did
not
file
a
brief
amicus
before
the
case
was
decided,
but
after
the
case
was
decided,
a
petition
for
or
adoption
within
the
nature
of
petition
for
rehearing
whether
was
filed
or
not
i
don't
recall.
but,
that
was
filed.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
briggs-stratton
case?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
briggs-stratton
case
opinion
is
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
referred
to
it
in
its
--
in
its
prior
decision
in
the
textile
workers
union
case.
in
the
textile
workers
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
not
in
this
one,
that's
right.
but,
this
case
relies
in
great
part
upon
the
board's
decision
in
the
textile
workers
union's
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
the
--
in
the
textile
workers
case,
which
as
i
said
earlier,
involve
an
industrial
plant,
the
union
engaged
in
so
called
harassing
tactics.
the
board
found
this
to
be
bad
and
addressed
itself
to
the
problem
--
to
the
problem
of
--
of
the
briggs-stratton
case
and
sought
to
distinguish
it.
the
court
of
appeals
can
agree
with
our
position
in
that
case.
now,
of
course
it
was
in
reliance
upon
its
opinion
in
that
case.
but
they
disagreed
with
the
board
and
this
one
also.
now,
as
i
said,
we
think
that
the
duty
to
bargain
collectively
embraces
something
more
--
something
more
than
a
sincere
desire
to
reach
agreement.
that
it
embraces
a
duty
to
refrain
from
tactics
which
are
inconsistent
with
the
mechanics
of
collective
bargaining.
i
think
that
this
is
borne
out
--
that
this
is
borne
out
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
heinz
case.
it
is
also
borne
out
by
section
8
(b)
(3)
of
the
statute.
in
the
heinz
case,
which
arose
under
their
original
wagner
act,
the
employer
was
refusing
to
memorialize
the
agreement
that
he
had
arrived
at
with
the
--
with
the
union
who
refused
to
embody
it
in
a
written
--
written
document.
the
wagner
act,
unlike
the
present
statute,
did
not
have
a
requirement
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
be
reduced
to
writing
upon
party
allows
other
--
the
other
requested.
this
court
held
that
the
employer's
refusal
to
memorialize
the
agreement
regardless
of
a
subjective
good
or
bad
faith,
that
the
employer's
refusal
to
memorialize
that
agreement
in
a
written
document
constituted
a
refusal
of
bargaining
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
court
said
that
the
reduction
of
agreement
to
a
written
form
was
the
final
step
for
the
collective
bargaining
process
that
congress
had
included
this
final
step
into
statutory
collective
bargaining
obligation
and
that
the
employer's
refusal
to
memorialize
it
--
memorialize
the
agreement
was
infringed
--
infringed
upon
the
collective
bargaining
process
that
the
statute
has
set
up.
as
similarly
in
section
8
(b)
(3),
i
think
also
have
been
is
a
purpose
by
congress
to
do
something
more
than
merely
to
insure
a
sincere
desire
to
this
agreement
but
named
--
but
rather
to
insure
an
addition
--
to
insure
an
addition
--
the
--
against
the
impairment
of
the
process
by
tactics
which
are
normally
--
not
normally
regarded
as
part
of
the
practice
and
procedures
of
collective
bargaining.
when
section
8
(b)
(3),
which
makes
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
bargain
collectively,
was
proposed
in
1947.
this
amendment
was
opposed
on
the
ground
that
it
was
unnecessary,
since
after
all,
it
was
of
the
unions.
it
was
the
business
of
unions
to
--
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
and
to
reach
agreement.
despite
this
opposition
and
the
alleged
superfluity
of
this
amendment,
the
amendment
was
enacted
and
we
think
it
is
a
fair
interest.
it
is
a
fair
interest
that
in
passing
this
amendment,
congress
sought
to
insure
something
more
than
a
sincere
desire
on
part
of
unions
to
reach
agreement.
that
it
sought
also
to
insure
as
the
wagner
act
did
it
with
respect
to
the
employers.
they'd
also
sought
to
insure
against
union
action
which
would
tend
to
impair
the
process
of
collective
bargaining
which
the
statute
contemplates.
now,
the
argument
is
also
made
that
if
these
tactics
--
if
these
tactics
disrupt
the
play
of
economic
forces
that
congress
contemplated
as
essential
to
make
the
collective
bargaining
scheme
operate
that
the
employer
has
a
quick
remedy
in
his
pocket
by
which
he
can
readdress
the
imbalance.
the
argument
is
made
that
the
employer,
since
these
activities
are
not
protected
by
the
statute,
that
the
employer
can
discharge
--
can
discharge
the
employees
and
thereby
in
effect
force
them
to
go
out
on
a
strike.
but,
i
submit
your
honor
that
this
does
not
serve
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
compel
the
employer
either
to
bargain
upon
the
--
under
the
handicap
of
this
disruptive
on-the-job
pressures
or
to
force
the
employees
to
go
out
on
strike.
after
all,
the
emphasis
of
the
statute
is
on
peaceful
collective
bargaining
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
not
served
--
it
is
not
served
if
the
alternative
which
the
employer
has
is
either
to
bargain
--
is
either
to
bargain
under
as
i
say,
the
handicap
of
these
pressures
or
to
force
the
employees
to
go
out
on
strike.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
your
honor.
we
filed
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
which
was
granted.
and
after
the
writ
was
granted,
the
board
certified
another
union
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees
of
the
employer
in
that
case.
the
board's
order
in
that
case
as
in
here
was
directed
to
the
particular
union
or
its
successors
as
long
as
it
was
about
collective
bargaining
agent
of
the
employees.
when
the
board
certified
in
another
representation
proceeding
certified
another
union,
we
called
this
matter
to
the
attention
of
this
court
indicating
that
this
possibly
may
have
mooted
the
case
but
in
our
view,
it
did
not.
on
the
basis
of
that
memorandum
this
court
vacated
the
writ
--
vacated
the
writ
and
denied
certiorari.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
other
cases
which
i
have
in
mind
your
honor
is
one
that's
reaching
the
issue
in
which
the
employees
refused
to
work
overtime
--
overtime.
and
this
was
part
of
a
designed
pressure
upon
the
employer
to
deal
with
its
term
--
to
deal
with
the
union's
terms.
and
thereto,
the
board
has
held.
the
board
has
held
that
this
is
a
refusal
of
bargaining
with
the
effect.
these
are
the
only
two
cases
that
i
know
of
where
the
board
has
gotten
into
this
kind
of
activity
in
the
context
of
a
union's
refusal
or
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
have
had
--
we've
had
cases
involving
--
involving
under
this
what
i
really
describe
as
disruptive
on
the
job
practice,
but
not
--
not
very
often
in
a
bargaining
context
--
in
a
bargaining
context.
in
the
petition
that
we
--
in
our
--
in
our
petition
this
case
throughout
the
very
end
your
honor
will
see
that
we've
listed
a
number
of
cases
where
there
has
been
the
disruptive
on-the-job
tactics.
but,
only
a
very
few
of
these
cases
that
have
come
to
the
board
have
involved
its
bargaining
situation.
they've
--
they've
had
a
written
part
picking
on
some
other
kind
of
context
as
a
device.
as
a
device
for
pressuring
the
employer
--
for
pressuring
the
employer
--
they
are
--
in
view
of
the
union's
demand.
i
only
know
a
few
cases
that
the
board
has
passed.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
or
possibly
the
grievances
of
one
kind
or
another
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
--
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
have
nothing
further.
