yes,
just
what
was
done
before
you
get
off
to
the
law.
at
least
to
my
way
of
thinking,
that
this
is
part
of
a
question
that
a
judgment
on
the
fact
of
whether
what
was
done
may
fairly
be
said
to
be
inconsistent
with
an
honest
desire
to
bargain.
and
i
don't
want
to
go
off
unto
the
law
before
i
know
exactly
what
was
done
and
what
isn't
done
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
so
when
was
that
case
decided?
justice
potter
stewart
after
the
enactment
of
the
taft-hartley.
