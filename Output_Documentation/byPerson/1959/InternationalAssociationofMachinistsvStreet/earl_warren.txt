mr.
schoene,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kramer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
jones
smith.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gambrell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
material
and
some
other
things
we
need
to
know
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
not
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
do
you
distinguish
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gambrell,
is
--
isn't
this
getting
pretty
close
to
the
--
the
same
principle
that
you
have
in
an
integrated
bar?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes
you
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
--
let
me
say
this.
they
--
they
get
into
the
united
nations
situation.
they
get
into
the
bricker
amendment,
and
they
get
into
all
kinds
of
things
like
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
--
don't
they
spread
the
gospel
to
the
state
bars
and
don't
the
state
bars
get
into
it
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
sure
of
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
a
question
of
what
you
call
politics,
but
they
do
discuss
public
questions.
they
do
have
--
they
do
have
representatives
at
the
legislatures
that
go
there
and
spend
the
money
of
the
--
of
the
members
to
--
to
promote
things
that
some
members
don't
agree
with
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
mr.
gambrell,
an
integrated
bar
is
not
a
voluntary
association.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
belong
to
it
or
you
don't
practice
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
they
do
have
lobbyists
at
the
--
at
the
legislatures
that
--
that
go
into
public
affairs
and
--
and
various
kinds
of
legislation.
now,
what
--
what
is
the
fundamental
difference?
i
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
they
see
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
they're
not.
i
--
i
am
sure
they're
not
an
arm
of
the
court,
are
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
reveal
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
this
--
the
--
the
courts
have
a
right
to
them
how
they
could
spend
their
money?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
know,
i
belonged
to
an
integrated
bar
for
30
years
and
--
and
i
know
that
there
was
great
difference
of
opinion
as
to
some
of
the
things
that
were
advocated
in
the
state
bar,
things
that
i
advocated
myself
were
opposed
by
--
by
others.
but
i
know
that
the
state
bar
took
an
interest
in
those
things.
now
when
they
do,
when
they
go
before
the
legislature
and
advocate
those
things,
wherein
is
the
fundamental
difference
between
that
case
and
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
you'd
better
finish
it
tonight.
we're
going
to
finish
tonight.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
you're
finished
--
when
you're
finished,
you're
finished,
because
you
don't
get
any
with
the
court,
left
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it
is
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
not.
you
have
--
you
have
some
more
time
left.
i
hope
you
don't
think
i'm
against
integrated
bar.
i'm
so
very
much
in
favor
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
contend
that
each
one
of
--
each
of
your
clients
has
an
interest
of
$3000
or
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
--
would
you
mind
telling
us
how
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
this
kind
of
an
agreement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
i
--
i
was
just
trying
to
think
of
how
each
man
would
have
an
interest
of
$3000
in
this
litigation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
just
asked
you,
if
you
contend
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
will
be
when
the
red
light
comes
on
and
i'll
--
it's
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
schoene.
chief
justice
earl
warren
about
how
many
members?
just,
generally
if
you
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
900,000.
chief
justice
earl
warren
$3.25.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
--
the
dues
rate
varies
from
$2
to
$4.50
a
month.
so
if
you'll
take
say,
an
average
of
$4.00
times
900,000
why,
that
would
give
you
their
monthly
income.
now,
you
would
ask
the
proportion
of
free
funds
of
voluntary
money
as
compared
with
the
worth
of
money
derived
from
dues
and
the
machinists'
non-partisan
league,
i've
given
you
the
figure
of
--
total
figure
of
$51,000.
as
derived
from
dues
in
1957,
the
corresponding
figure
for
the
voluntary
collections
is
$35,308.82
roughly,
a
little
over
three-fifths.

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
interrupt
just
a
moment
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand,
you
say
there's
no
question
of
the
use
of
money
for
candidacies
for
public
office
here?
that's
done
by
assessment.
did
you
say

federal

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kramer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
kramer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kramer,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
it's
your
opinion
that
there
is
any
legislative
activity
at
all
on
the
part
of
the
union
that
violates
the
constitutional
rights
from
your
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
it
might
bear
directly
upon
the
collective
bargaining
for
wages
and
hours
in
labor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
any
of
the
dues
that
were
paid
by
your
clients
legitimately
expended?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
what
percentage?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
do
you
concede
that
there
was
any
portion
of
the
dues
that
were
legitimately
expended?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
why
shouldn't
you
if
it's
a
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
that's
really
--
i
just
want
to
ask
you
then,
why,
if
there
were
any
--
if
there
was
any
portion
of
these
dues
that
had
been
legitimately
expended,
why
should
your
clients
be
entitled
to
a
return
of
all
of
the
money
that
they've
paid
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
95%
of
all
the
money
that
was
collected
had
been
spent
legitimately
and
5%
of
it
was
expended
for
political
purposes
that
concededly
were
improper
and
illegal,
and
as
you
say
unconstitutional.
should
that
entitle
you
to
return
of
all
the
dues
that
had
been
paid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
that
lead
us
--
lead
us
then
to
the
solicitor
general's
suggestion
that
that's
what
should
happen
in
this
case
that
it
should
go
back
and
have
it
determined
what,
among
these
activities,
were
political,
what
were
nonpolitical,
what
percentage
of
the
money
was
legally
spent
and
what
was
not
legally
spent
before
there
is
an
order
of
the
court
to
determine
what
percentage
of
dues
paid
should
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
can
they
make
the
record?
you
said
they
--
before
they
should
make
a
record
in
accounting
and
i
say
--
i
say,
well
why
doesn't
that
lead
us
to
what
the
solicitor
general
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
shouldn't
it
go
back
for
that
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
are
not
denying
that
you
should
have
constitutional
protection
but
you're
asking
for
all
--
to
return
of
all
of
these
dues
and
are
you
entitled
to
all
of
them
if
for
instance
the
vast
majority
of
the
money
spent
was
spent
for
legitimate
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
before
we
get
--
before
we
get
to
that,
i
just
like
to
ask
you
if
you
can
give
us
any
guidance
as
to
what
dividing
line
between
those
expenditures
which
are
legal
and
constitutional
and
those
which
are
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
we
get
a
start?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
--
i'm
asking
those
which
are
--
well,
if
you
want
to
start
with
those
that
are
illegal,
alright.
i
thought
maybe
to
start
with
those
that
were
legal
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
then
we'll
get
some
of
the
legal
ones.
chief
justice
earl
warren
either
way
you
want
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
length
of
the
--
the
length
of
the
record
doesn't
establish
much
force.
what
i'm
wondering
is
that,
if
you
can't
tell
us
what
in
your
opinion
would
be
legitimate
expenditure
from
those
dues
as
distinguished
from
the
illegal
one
–
now
there
must
be
some
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
must
be
some
legitimate
expenditure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
officers
of
the
union?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
did
that
for
a
long
number
of
years,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
he
has
one
he
has
a
constitutional
right
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
maintain
his
protection
and
his
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
profession.
chief
justice
earl
warren
somewhat
--
and
that
somewhat
the
same
principle
of
labor
unions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
when
they
go
to
the
legislature
and
have
lobby
us
there
and
when
they
advocate
legislative
measures,
are
they
acting
in
any
different
capacity
or
in
any
different
way
than
these
labor
unions
are
acting
when
they
have
a
union
shop?
chief
justice
earl
warren
constitutionally
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
constitutionally,
i
am
speaking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
when
they
go
there
to
determine
the
salaries
of
judges,
a
very
common
--
a
very
common
practice
of
integrated
bars,
number
of
judges,
salaries
of
judges,
qualifications
of
judges,
and
so
forth,
is
that
political?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
would
--
do
you
think
that
the
integrated
bar
acts
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
same
reason
that
you
alleged
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
--
oh
you're
not
--
you're
not
asking
the
court
direction
to
amend
their
ways,
you
want
the
act
declared
unconstitutional
so
far
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
so
far
as
these
people
are
concerned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
gambrell,
i
don't
think
it's
departing
very
far
from
what
most
people
know
that
the
--
that
the
bars
of
the
country,
including
--
including
integrated
bars,
interest
themselves
in
things
like
the
bricker
amendment,
is
that
politics?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
i
say
also
--
also
integrated
bars.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i've
set
to
meetings
and
--
of
them
and
have
heard
them
discussed
and
heard
resolutions
passed
on
the
subject.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
ask
us
to
reverse
the
wisconsin
case
on
this
--
on
the
integrated
bar
as
you
want
us
to
do
with
the
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
they're
arguing
to
us
for
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
didn't
ask
you
until
you
got
into
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
an
answer
to
justice
black?
do
you
consider
that
an
answer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.

warren

et

mr.
gambrell,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
gambrell,
let
me
ask
me
you
this.
suppose
the
contract
itself
is
within
the
statute
as
written
and
suppose
the
dues
collected
are
within
the
statute
as
written,
do
you
believe
that
we
should
strike
the
statute
down,
because
of
the
possibility
of
someone
violating
it
in
the
future?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
just
trying
to
test
your
present
argument
to
the
extreme.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i'm
wondering
if
we
should
be
bound
by
what
the
petitioners
say
congress
meant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
they
stipulate
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
schoene.
