justice
potter
stewart
that
the
money
is
used
isn't
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
it.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gambrell,
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
showing
of
the
--
what
fraction
of
these
dues
are
used
for
purposes
which
you
would
claim
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
was,
of
course,
the
court
of
equity
wasn't
--
was
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i'd
supposed
in
your
state
as
--
in
your
state
as
in
most
states,
the
chancellor
has
a
good
deal
with
freedom
and
fashioning
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
accomplish
equity.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
was
wondering
if
--
i
was
wondering
if
any
consideration
at
all
is
given
or
if
the
issues
were
shaped
in
such
a
way
that
any
consideration
could
be
given
to
the
transfer
is
working
out
by
--
in
terms
of
a
decree,
the
same
kind
of
a
thing
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
just
referred
to
early
in
the
argument.
it's
done
in
england,
enabling
a
--
a
person
to
contract
away,
or
contract
out
of
a
union-shop
to
the
extent
that
these
funds
are
used
to
promote
beliefs
and
ideas
in
which
he
does
not
believe,
and
--
and
with
which
he
disagrees.
justice
potter
stewart
they
ever
brought
their
objections
here?
justice
potter
stewart
have
any
members
of
any
integrated
bars
brought
any
objections
they
may
have
to
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
that
from
what
you've
just
been
reading
is
the
recent
wisconsin
case,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
a
daily
newspaper?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
a
daily
newspaper?
justice
potter
stewart
weekly
newspaper.
justice
potter
stewart
otherwise,
there
would
be
a
violation
of
that
act.
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
violation
of
the
act.
justice
potter
stewart
on
their
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
does
do
this
much,
doesn't
it?
if
a
union
member
is
required
to
give
$5.00
to
the
union,
which
$5.00
--
or
make
it
easy,
let's
say
$1.00,
that
is
spent
to
support
a
certain
candidate.
that
takes
--
that
prevents
him
from
spending
that
dollar
for
the
candidate's
opponent.
justice
potter
stewart
so
am
i.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
about
the
expenditure
by
the
union,
of
that
member's
dollar
for
mr.
smith.
justice
potter
stewart
that
prevents
that
member
for
spending
that
dollar
against
mr.
smith.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
questionably
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
presents
the
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
was
simply
addressed
to
the
statements
you
were
making
to
us
at
the
time
that
there
was
nothing
in
this
to
prevent
a
member
from
supporting
or
failing
to
support
or
refusing
to
support
somebody
else.
justice
potter
stewart
this
plaintiff
for
the
case
like
that
runs
into
additional
different
hurdle
of
massachusetts
against
mellon,
someone
does
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
our
position
is
and
that
is
only
this
that
not
the
congress
is
supposed
to
say
these
things
sua
sponte
but
that
the
people
who
are
there
in
their
they're
exercise
to
try
to
persuade
congress
to
do
something
should
be
truly
representative
of
those
who
want
that
thing
done
by
representing
a
lot
of
unwilling
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
constituents.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
here,
we're
not
dealing
with
what
a
state
can
do,
are
we?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case
right
here.
we're
--
this
is
â€“
isn't
it
all
an
state
action?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
that
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
does
involve
state
action
which
is
allegedly
unconstitutional.
it's
not
that
kind
of
a
case
at
all.
this
--
a
court
which
happens
to
be
a
state
court
saying
that
a
certain
aspect
or
certain
activity
under
a
federal
statute
violates
the
federal
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
state
as
contrasted
of
federal
government.
this
isn't
that
kind
of
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
point
is
that
there
might
be
a
fraction
of
a
one
cent
from
each
of
these
appellees.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
union
is
being
threatened
by
proposed
legislation
which
we
might
put
it
out
of
existence,
the
money
couldn't
be
used
to
try
to
indicate
that
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
fight
it
in
detail.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me
mr.
gambrell,
i
did
not
understand
it
to
be
the
admission
of
the
appellees
that
this
was
a
governmental
enterprise.
that
is
the
expenditure
of
money.
i
think
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
first
part
of
their
argument
that
this
was
not
a
governmental
enterprise.
justice
potter
stewart
my
understanding
of
their
argument
was
and
i
may
have
misunderstood
it
but
generalizing
was
that
the
collective
bargaining
aspects
of
union
activity
was
this
court
has
held
infused
with
the
(inaudible)
of
the
federal
government
and
therefore
was
a
quasi
governmental
enterprise.
and
that's
hanson
and
thompson
and
steele
in
those
cases.
but
that
the
expenditure
of
money
was
not
--
that
was
their
argument
as
i
understood
it.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
mr.
schoene,
before
the
--
before
the
union-shop,
none
of
those
activities
would've
been
solved
or
brought
up
any
of
the
constitutional
claims
here
involved.
