mr.
milton
kramer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
submit
of
course
that
the
court
need
reach
no
further
issues.
that
the
hanson
case
is
fully
dispositive
of
every
contention
raised
by
the
appellees;
that
is,
the
individual
appellees.
but
if
it
is
not
dispositive
of
the
case
in
its
entirety,
then
what
do
we
have
here?
we
have
an
act
of
congress
adding
section
2,
eleventh,
to
the
railway
labor
act
which
did
two
things.
first,
it
repealed
in
part
the
congressional
prohibition
of
a
union
shop
in
the
railroad
and
airline
industries.
now,
i
take
it
there
can
be
no
serious
question
of
the
power
of
congress
to
repeal
its
own
prohibition.
the
second
thing
that
that
act
did
was
expressly
to
declare
the
congressional
intention
to
supersede
any
state
laws
that
might
limit
or
prohibit
a
union
shop
in
the
railroad
and
airline
industries.
now,
the
appellees
say
that
somehow
that
second
purpose
was
not
accomplished.
that
congress
with
section
2,
eleventh,
was
ineffective
to
supersede
state
law.
now,
let
us
assume
for
a
moment
that
that
is
so.
i
will
just
show
next,
that
it
is
not
so.
but
assume
for
a
moment
that
it
is
so.
then
what
do
we
have?
we
have
no
federal
prohibition
of
a
union
shop,
and
we
likewise
have
no
state
prohibition
of
a
union
shop.
so
the
union
shop
would
mean
we
would
still
be
valid.
now,
georgia
has
a
right
to
work
on.
the
court
below,
at
least
the
trial
court
and
by
implication
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
held
that
a
union-shop
agreement
violates
state
law.
that
would
appear
to
be
a
state
question.
the
determination
of
which
by
the
supreme
court
of
a
state
would
be
taken
as
conclusive
by
this
court,
but
always
subject
to
the
requirement
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
the
court
below
said
that
it
violates
this
--
the
law
of
georgia
but
they
cited
nothing,
no
case,
no
statute.
now
there
was
no
case
squarely
in
point.
all
the
georgia
cases
that
involved
the
union
shop
assumed
that
a
union
shop
was
valid,
both
the
court
and
the
litigants
assumed
it
was
valid.
and,
of
course,
basically
the
union-shop
agreement
is
valid
at
common
law.
the
most
complete
discussion
of
that
that
i
know
of
is
in
hudson
against
the
atlantic
coastline
railroad
in
242
n.c.
georgia
enacted
a
right
to
work
law
in
the
late
1940s.
if
a
union
shop
were
invalid
there
you
wouldn't
have
needed
such
an
act.
but
suppose
we
assume
that
the
statute
was
declaratory
of
the
common
law.
if
so,
it
was
declaratory
of
what?
the
statute
specifically
accepts
the
railroad
industry
and
the
airline
industry
from
its
operation.
the
statute
specifically
says,
“a
union
shop
or
a
closed
shop
is
unlawful
except
when
entered
into
between
an
employer
and
an
organization
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act,
as
the
railway
labor
act
may
be
amended
from
time
to
time.
mr.
milton
kramer
if
that
decision
were
to
stand,
then
at
the
very
least,
no
union
that
engages
in
activities
other
than
strictly
collective
bargaining,
no
union
that
belongs
to
the
afl-cio,
no
union
that
has
its
legislative
representative
in
washington
or
in
a
state
capital,
no
union
that
lends
aide
to
a
candidate
for
political
office,
were
lawful
to
do
so
could
have
union
shop.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
afl-cio
does
engage
in
legislative
activities.
mr.
milton
kramer
some
of
the
money
of
these
plaintiffs
go
to
local
lodges
and
some
of
that
money
goes
to
the
national
organization
and
some
of
the
moneys
from
the
national
organization
goes
to
the
afl-cio
--
mr.
milton
kramer
--
that's
the
argument.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
the
afl
--
mr.
milton
kramer
the
--
the
afl-cio
doesn't
take
money
that
way.
if
you're
affiliated
with
the
afl-cio,
you
pay
5
cents
per
capita
per
month.
mr.
milton
kramer
but
as
the
union
says
that.
mr.
milton
kramer
you
would
--
mr.
milton
kramer
it
did.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
no.
they
said
so
long
as
you
do
that
you
can't
have
a
union
shop.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
if
you
can
determine
what
that
is,
if
you
had,
if
you'd
never
had
any
of
your
officers
testify
before
any
legislation,
before
any,
before
congress.
if
you
put
out
what
was
in
your
magazine,
if
you
stop
subscribing
to
the
newspaper
labor
for
your
members,
if
you
stop
engaging
in
educational
activities,
if
you
stop
having
a
pension
fund
for
--
for
--
not
a
pension
fund
but
a
death
benefit
fund
for
deceased
members,
or
the
families
of
deceased
members
.
mr.
milton
kramer
only
collective
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
the
court
below
said
that
“all
that
this
court
held
in
the
hanson
case,
and
that's
--
that's
as
far
as
they're
going
to
go,
is
that
you
can
require
the
payment
of
dues
to
support
the
cost
of
collective
bargaining
and
nothing
else.
mr.
milton
kramer
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well
they
tell
you
where
it
does
not
take
it,
yes
but
that
was
the
arguments
in
the
brief.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
not
--
not
definitively.
they
do
say
this
that
if
money
is
spent
for
any
purpose
with
which
the
involuntary
member
or
the
involuntary
payor,
these
are
tools.
that
is
infringing
his
rights.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
no,
outside
the
field
of
collective
bargaining.
i
disapprove
--
mr.
milton
kramer
it
--
it
is
to
them,
plus
grievances.
that
is,
we
--
we
cannot
have
anyone
go
before
a
congressional
committee
and
testify
on
such
matters
as
available
through
the
sherman
act
whether
they
deal
with
unemployment
in
the
sherman's
act.
mr.
milton
kramer
that
is
legislation.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
in
the
opinion?
mr.
milton
kramer
on
page
269
of
the
record,
that's
in
the
middle
of
the
opinion
somewhere.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
says
--
maybe
i
should
read
it.
"one
who
is
compelled
to
contribute
the
fruits
of
his
labor
to
support
or
promote
political
or
economic
programs
or
support
candidates
for
public
office
is
just
as
much
deprived
of
his
freedom
of
speech
as
if
he
were
compelled
to
give
vocal
support
to
doctrines
he
opposes.”
and
why
is
that
so?
two
sentences
later,
“because
there
was
an
old
saying
that
money
talks.”
and
this
is
done
indirectly,
quite
indirectly
with
his
money.
and
so
it's
just
as
though
you
are
making
him
say
the
things
that
you
say
to
committees
or
that
the
afl-cio
says,
or
that
railway
labor
executives'
association
says,
or
that
some
state
candidate
for
office
who
may
receive
funds
indirectly
from
the
union
says.
money
talks,
that
is,
making
you
talk.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
the
decree
which
is
in
the
record
at
page
101,
near
the
end.
thus
says
that
if
the
unions
will
come
back
and
show
that
they
no
longer
engaged
in
the
aforesaid
unlawful
activities,
we
will
reconsider
the
decree
and
perhaps
dissolve
it.
but
it
doesn't
say
what
aforesaid
activities
are
illegal.
it
just
says
the
aforesaid
illegal
activities.
now,
it
does
say
that
the
unions
published
a
newspaper
labor.
it
does
differ
to
the
magazines
that
they're
better
published.
it
does
differ
to
the
unions
engaging
in
legislative
and
political
activities.
i
assume
it
meant
that
all
of
that
was
illegal,
although
obviously,
it
is
not
illegal.
no
one
is
asking
that
the
unions
be
prevented
from
engaging
on
those
activities,
they
seek
--
that
they
--
they
seek
the
sanction.
not
of
preventing
the
unions
from
doing
these
things
they
don't
like.
but
they
seek
the
sanction
of
having
a
union-shop
agreement
that
the
unions
have,
declared
invalid,
because
they
do
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
the
burden
of
the
opinion
is
that
--
is
that
this
court
sustained
a
union-shop
agreement
only
to
the
extent
that
payment
could
be
required
for
a
fair
share
of
the
cost
of
collective
bargaining,
whatever
that
is,
not
including
activities
in
the
legislative
or
political
or
educational
field.
mr.
milton
kramer
and
handling
grievances,
that's
all.
that's
the
argument
made
by
the
individual
appellees.
now
the
railroad
--
it
might
talk
about
appellees
that
talk
about
the
individual
appellees.
the
railroad
appellees
take
no
position.
they
say
despite
between
two
other
people.
now,
the
argument
that
section
2,
eleventh
was
invalid
to
supersede
state
law
is
something
i
don't
quite
understand.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
necessarily
an
argument
that
the
constitution
is
unconstitutional
or
at
least
that
the
second
clause
of
article
6
is
unconstitutional.
they
say
it
is
ineffective
to
supersede
state
law
because
if
it
supersedes
the
state
law,
assuming
they,
the
right
to
work
or
didn't
accept
the
railroad
industry,
it
deprives
them
of
rights
under
state
law.
it
is
the
existence
of
state
law
that
strikes
down
the
federal
statute.
now,
normally
when
the
question
it
provides
is
about
whether
--
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
that's
the
plaintiff's
argument.
i'm
just
answering
one
of
their
arguments.
that's
--
mr.
milton
kramer
not
in
the
opinion
below,
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
but
--
but
it's
invalid.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right,
they
see
it's
invalid.
but
it's
invalid
because
of
the
existence
of
state
law.
mr.
milton
kramer
not
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
no.
it
seems
to
me
that
heretofore
the
inquiry
has
always
been
what
did
congress
intend
when
the
question
has
arisen
about
whether
state
law
was
inconsistent
with
the
federal
purpose.
it
was
always
an
inquiry
of
intention,
never
an
inquiry
of
the
power
of
congress
to
supersede
where
congress
can
legislate.
and
certainly
congress
can
legislate
in
the
field
of
labor
relations
in
the
railroad
industry.
no
one
questions
that
the
federal
prohibition
from
1934
to
1951
that
the
union
shop
was
valid
legislation.
but
then
the
--
the
question
is
always
what
did
congress
intend,
in
fact
this
court
on
numerous
occasions,
even
in
the
absence
of
any
federal
legislation
at
all,
has
stricken
state
legislation
because
it
found
the
state
legislation
inconsistent
with
the
requirement
of
uniformity,
of
legislative
restrictions
with
respect
to
interstate
commerce.
if
we
strike
down
the
federal
statute
because
it
supersedes
a
state
law,
we
reach
exactly
the
opposite
result
of
what
the
supremacy
clause
was
intended
to
achieve.
it
isn't
congress
that
strikes
down
the
state
law.
it's
the
supremacy
clause
that
says
when
congress
intends
to,
state
law
shall
be
inapplicable.
that
argument
necessarily
comes
down
to
an
argument
that
article
vi
is
ineffective
and
unconstitutional.
now,
there's
been
a
great
deal
of
talk
in
this
case,
reached
below,
reached
n
this
court,
concerning
government
action.
and
i
--
and
so,
the
finding
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
government
action
magically
somehow
makes
action
valid
or
invalid.
i
think
it
would
be
beneficial
if
we
examine
a
little
bit
what
government
action
there
is
and
the
consequence
of
the
government
action.
now,
of
course,
the
enactment
of
section
2,
eleventh,
was
government
action.
there
was
no
question
to
that.
but
what
did
congress
do
when
it
enacted
section
2,
eleventh?
it
repealed
its
own
prohibition
and
declared
its
intention
to
preempt
state
law.
i
submit
that
presents
a
different
type
of
question,
a
different
type
of
government
action
than
if
congress
had
enacted
a
statute
saying
that
no
one
shall
work
in
a
railroad
unless
he
belongs
to
the
brotherhood
of
railway
clerks.
that
would
present
a
different
type
of
government
action.
here,
all
that
congress
did
was
not
prohibit
an
agreement,
so
providing,
as
saying
state
law
shall
not
apply
to
the
validity
of
that
agreement,
or
similarly.
if
congress
were
to
enact
a
statute,
providing
that
a
locomotive
engineer,
let's
say,
shall
get
paid
a
stated
number
of
dollars
for
each
150
miles
in
passenger
service
or
each
of
a
hundred
miles
in
freight
service,
or
eight
hours
whichever
comes
sooner.
with
certain
differentials
in
a
quite
complicated
formula
depending
on
differences
and
waits
on
drivers
and
with
other
differentials
for
short
turnaround
service.
if
congress
enacted
a
statute,
so
providing,
such
a
wage
scale,
you
would
have
a
very
different
question
than
you
would
have,
when
the
issue
is
the
validity
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
providing
such
a
wage
scale
entered
into
by
a
union
designated
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
that's
a
very
different
kind
of
question.
the
government
action
here
was
minimal.
repeal
the
prohibition
and
preempt
it.
the
government
did
very
little.
now
the
plaintiffs,
the
appellees
argue
that
there's
other
kinds
of
government
action
here
besides
legislative
but
i
think
we
can
just
go
to
that
quickly.
they
say
that
there
was
executive
government
action,
because
the
union-shop
agreement
came
about
after
mediation
and
after
an
emergency
board
made
a
report
to
the
president.
and
they
say
that,
therefore,
the
executive
department
influenced
the
entering
into
of
this
contract
and
therefore
you'd
have
this
validity
as
though
the
government
had
ordered
it.
well,
i
submit
but
it's
simply
nonsense
to
argue,
that
a
contract
which
would
be
valid
if
entered
into
without
mediation,
is
tested
by
a
different
standard
of
validity
if
entered
into
after
mediation.
this
just
makes
no
sense.
they
also
argue
that
there's
judicial
government
action.
they
tried
to
rely
on
shelley
against
kraemer,
obviously
misplaced
because
nobody,
none
of
the
unions
here
is
asking
any
court
to
enforce
any
agreement.
so
if
there
were
anything
to
shelley
against
kraemer
point,
it
is
much
too
premature
even
to
be
considered.
in
considering
government
action
also,
you
must
look
at
what
is
the
complainant's
complaining
about.
they
rely
heavily
on
two
dissenting
opinions
in
this
court,
pollack
against
the
public
utilities
commission,
and
the
black
against
cutter
laboratories
351
u.s.
now
if
we
assume
those
dissenting
opinions
to
express
the
law,
let's
see
what
happened
to
the
complaining
party
there
and
what
happened
to
the
complaining
party
here.
mr.
pollack
could
not
ride
washington's
buses
without
listening
to
the
radio.
he
was
forced
to
listen.
well,
now,
the
afl
sponsors
two
radio
programs
and
this
union
published
magazine.
but
nobody
has
to
listen,
nobody
has
to
read.
they
rely
on
the
cutter
laboratories'
case.
in
that
case,
what
happened
to
the
person
who
was
allegedly
mistreated?
doris
walker
was
fired
because
of
what
she
believed.
she
was
fired
because
of
what
she
believed.
what
happens
to
the
people
here?
they
have
to
pay
$3.00
a
month.
some
of
which
gets
spent
for
purposes
of
which
they
disapprove.
but
that's
all
they
have
to
do
to
keep
their
jobs.
they
don't
have
to
believe
or
disbelieve.
they
don't
have
to
read,
they
don't
have
to
listen.
just
pay
on
the
average,
approximately
of
$3.00
a
month.
mr.
milton
kramer
that
is
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
is
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
--
i
submit
it
is
not
because
they
don't
have
to
do
anything
except
pay
a
little
bit
of
money.
mr.
milton
kramer
there
are
numerous
cases.
mr.
milton
kramer
is
what
--
conceded.
mr.
milton
kramer
that
part
of
the
money
is
spent
--
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
a
portion
of
the
money,
after
it
was
received
by
the
union
--
mr.
milton
kramer
--
is
used
to
support
or
oppose
legislation.
well,
to
support
legislation
which
they
opposed,
or
to
oppose
legislation
which
they
support.
mr.
milton
kramer
a
portion
of
it
is,
but
what
kind
of
legislation?
there
would
be
time
to
enact
the
amendments.
there
will
be
labor
act
amendments,
some
other
things
when
it
gets
to
the
afl-cio.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
my
point
is
that's
the
type
of
legislation.
it's
a
type
of
activity
in
which
unions
normally
engage,
had
always
have
engaged.
it's
the
kind
of
things
that
i
submit
unions
would
be
derelict,
in
their
duty
if
they
did
not
engage
in.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
certainly
do.
i
--
i
--
mr.
milton
kramer
of
course.
mr.
milton
kramer
as
if,
well,
you
mean
because
limited
to
women.
mr.
milton
kramer
because
limited
to
women.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
but
what
are
these
people
forced
to
do,
pay
$3
--
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
and
in
very
recent,
today,
there
are
union
members
who
oppose
seniority
because
the
older
people
get
the
benefit
of
that
and
the
younger
members
would
rather
not
--
passing
out
the
provisions
in
the
contract.
there
are
three
cases,
very
recent
ones
in
which
union
members
sue
to
attack
the
validity
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
imposing
compulsory
retirement
at
age
70.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right,
and
there
are
some
who
favor
it.
anything
that
the
union
does,
will
have
--
well,
if
it's
a
controversial
subject
at
all,
will
have
people
on
one
side,
and
people
on
the
other.
now
the
case
--
mr.
milton
kramer
i
--
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
to
--
mr.
milton
kramer
if
we
win
this
case,
we'll
keep
on
doing
on
the
same
thing
we
have
been
doing.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you
mean,
by
public
views.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
well
we
have
the
--
mr.
milton
kramer
in
part,
yes.
it
will
be
used
in
part
to
advocate.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
your
honor,
the
case
is
directly
analogous
not
in
this
court,
but
the
integrated
bar
cases,
a
very
recent
one,
who
has
to
come
raise
exactly
that
issue.
a
man
sued
to
get
back
his
$15.00
in
the
wisconsin
integrated
bar
on
the
ground
that
the
integrated
bar
engaged
in
legislative
activities,
favoring
or
apposing,
i
forget
which,
legislation
with
his
own
views
were
the
other
way.
mr.
milton
kramer
exactly
this
case.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
he's
--
he's
lost
the
case.
it
had
--
mr.
milton
kramer
it
was
decided
two
weeks
ago.
mr.
milton
kramer
not
here.
only
decided
two
weeks
ago,
but
prior
to
that,
in
--
in
a
decision
that
was
not
contested,
the
wisconsin
court
had
said
the
same
thing.
that
when
the
--
when
the
labor
--
when
the
--
when
the
bar
association
expresses
views,
publicly
or
anyway,
before
legislature,
everyone
knows
or
should
know
that
is
--
it's
expressing
the
organization's
views.
it
is
not
expressing
the
views
of
all
its
members.
it's
expressing
the
policy
of
the
organization
as
a
whole,
and
that
it
may
be
assumed
there
were
dissidents
in
the
organizations.
mr.
milton
kramer
that
it
is
desirable.
pardon
me.
mr.
milton
kramer
not
--
not
by
name,
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
that
this
evidence
that
the
newspaper
labor,
for
which
subscriptions
are
a
purchased
for
some
of
the
members
of
some
of
the
unions
had
supported
particular
candidate.
but
that's
the
only
place
particular
candidates
are
named.
that
is
where
union
money
is
used.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
think
it,
quite
certainly,
will
not.
they
will
vote
as
they
please,
if
the
use
the
money
--
mr.
milton
kramer
i
think
that
is
--
mr.
milton
kramer
--
almost
certainly,
so.
i'd
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
just
one
point
more
i'd
like
to
make
in
response
to
justice
black.
and
that
this,
if
the
use
of
money
forcibly
extracted
from
an
individual
to
support
purposes
or
activities
or
views
which
he
opposes,
is
unlawful,
then
the
voice
of
america
supported
by
tax
funds
appropriated
by
congress
or
the
salaries
paid
to
chaplains
in
the
armed
forces,
appropriated
by
congress
on
tax
moneys,
would
all
be
unconstitutional
because
there
are
people
who
are
isolationists,
who
are
taxpayers,
and
there
are
people
who
are
atheists
who
are
taxpayers,
and
as
an
atheist
could
refuse
to
pay
his
taxes
because
if
his
money
is
being
spent
with
much
greater
compulsion
than
is
here,
his
money
that's
extracted
with
greater
compulsion
and
used
to
express
views
and
advocate
policies
of
which
he
disapproves.
now,
there
are
other
reasons
the
case
should
be
reversed.
we'd
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
they're
all
discussed
in
the
brief
but
i
submit
that
the
clearest
disposition
of
this
case
is
that,
this
case
is
the
same
as
hanson
only
the
arguments
were
made
up
and
disposed
of
there.
mr.
milton
kramer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
not
repeat
the
arguments
we
made
at
the
first
hearing
on
this
case
last
spring.
they
are
all
contained
in
the
briefs
that
were
filed
last
year
and
in
our
reply
brief.
before
i
begin
with
the
argument
i
attended
to
make,
i
would
like
to
answer
further,
the
comment
of
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
i
--
mr.
milton
kramer
with
respect
to
whether
the
federal
government
can
pass
a
law
saying
that,
state
law
shall
no
longer
protect
a
citizen
in
a
certain
respect,
that
is
being
required
to
join
the
union.
i
argued
that
fully
last
year.
it
is
discussed
fully
in
our
brief
filed
last
year.
i
would
like
to
say
at
this
time
just
this.
to
me,
it
is
incomprehensible
that
a
statute
becomes
unconstitutional
because
congress
preempts
a
field
in
which
it
may
legislate.
now,
this
discussed
fully
in
our
brief
but
that
basically
is
it.
if
congress
may
legislate,
it
can
preempt.
the
preemption
comes
about,
not
by
act
of
congress,
but
by
article
6
of
the
constitution
to
say
that
the
statute
is
therefore
becomes
unconstitutional
in
a
field
where
congress
may
legislate
because
congress
has
preempted.
it's
in
effect
to
say
that
article
6
was
unconstitutional.
it's
the
constitution
that
preempts,
not
congress.
congress
merely
indicates
what
it
intends
to
do.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
would
say
that
that
does
not
make
the
act
of
congress
unconstitutional,
because
the
only
thing
that
the
government
has
done
up
to
that
point
is
supersede
state
law.
and
i
don't
see
how
superseding
state
law
can
ever
be
unconstitutional
so
long
that
is
in
a
field
where
congress
may
legislate.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh!
that's
right.
that's
right.
now,
i
want
to
take
up
now
the
proposition
that
even
if
we
assume
that
the
expenditure
of
money
by
a
union,
although
it
does
not
derive
the
power
to
spend
money
from
congress.
but
even
if
we
assume
that
somehow
that
has
the
imprimatur
of
government,
that
nevertheless,
such
expenditures,
the
ones
here
involved,
violate
the
first
amendment
rights
of
no
one.
the
contention
here
is
basically
almost
exclusively
that
their
first
amendment
rights,
freedom
of
speech,
freedom
of
press
and
so
on.
first,
nothing
that
the
union
publishes
or
espouses,
or
otherwise
supports,
prevents
anybody
from
doing
anything.
everybody,
the
plaintiffs,
the
appellees,
here
included,
has
just
as
much
right
to
publish,
to
print,
to
speak
or
to
do
anything
else
that
the
first
amendment
guarantees
against
government
impingements.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
am
talking
about
the
expenditure.
mr.
milton
kramer
not
the
collecting
of
the
money
from
the
individual.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
it
does
not
because
if
the
union
did
not
spend
it
for
mr.
smith,
the
individual
still
could
not
spend
it
against
him.
it
isn't
his
anymore.
mr.
milton
kramer
that
we
don't
know.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
these
activities
are
of
greater
by
reason
of
the
union
shop
or
less
by
reason
of
the
union
shop
or
what
the
union
does
with
the
extra
money
they
are
getting
collected
under
the
--
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
the
reason
they
could
make
the
agreement,
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right,
to
hold
the
job,
i
guess.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
i
thought,
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
was
with
the
expected
--
the
contribution
of
a
dollar
in
favor
of
mr.
smith,
a
candidate.
i
say
that
even
if
the
union
did
not
make
that
expenditure,
the
individual
employee
still
couldn't
get
that
dollar
back.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
what
i
said
we
don't
know.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
the
union
does
with
the
additional
income
it
gets
by
reason
of
the
union-shop.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
think
that
nothing
that
the
union
said
is
understood
as
expressing
the
views
of
every
single
member
of
the
union.
now,
this
view
was
stated
very
clearly
by
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
in
the
case
that
has
to
be
argued
immediately
after
this
one,
and
i
wouldn't
take
up
your
time
by
quoting
them.
we
did
quote
it
last
year.
i
think
the
view
is
expressed
most
clearly
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
the
celebrated
demille
case
in
which
--
which
was
very
similar
to
this
one
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
some
three
or
four
years
ago.
but
in
demille
case,
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
with
respect
to
the
contention
that
the
expenditure
of
money
to
espouse
a
view
with
which
the
individual
disagreed
was
compelling
him
to
espouse
that
view.
they
said
similarly
to
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
"payment
by
the
plaintiff
of
the
assessment
would
not
stamp
his
act
as
a
personal
endorsement
of
the
declared
view
of
the
majority.
majority
rule
necessarily
prevailed
in
all
constitutional
government.
else
payment
of
a
tax
levied
for
a
duly
authorized
and
proper
objective
could
be
avoided
by
the
mere
assertion
of
beliefs
and
sentiments
opposed
to
the
accomplishment
thereof.
in
a
government
based
on
democratic
principles,
the
benefit
as
perceived
by
the
majority
prevails."
now,
i
think
that
is
the
approach
here.
this
is
just
like
in
the
case
following
this
one.
nobody
is
compelled
to
say
anything
and
the
fact
that
an
organization
to
which
he
is
compelled
to
belong
says
something
does
not
mean
that
he
is
saying
it.
i
submit
that
what
the
--
what
the
appellees
are
arguing
here
in
substance
is
that
it
is
unconstitutional
for
unions
to
do
what
i
think
most
of
this
court
has
indicated.
they
not
only
made
properly
do
but
have
a
constitutional
right
to
do.
and
i'm
referring
to
the
cio
and
uaw
cases,
that
is
united
states
against
cio
in
135
--
335
u.s.,
and
united
states
against
united
automobile
workers
in
352
u.s.
the
majority
of
the
union
has
constitutional
rights
too.
they
have
the
right
to
speak
and
they
have
the
right
to
speak
collectively.
in
the
first
of
those
cases,
four
justices
of
this
court
would
have
held
it
unconstitutional
to
prohibit
a
union
from
printing
matters
in
their
union
publications
that
did
not
pertain
to
collective
bargaining.
in
that
case
it
was
--
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
there
was
no
union
shop
issue
in
that
case.
no.
but
i
submit
with
respect
to
that
mr.
justice
black,
that
there
are
other
inducements
than
the
union
shop
to
get
people
--
to
persuade
people
to
join
the
union,
for
example,
it
is
thoroughly
established
--
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
you
have
the
same
kind
of
trouble,
yes,
with
respect
to
a
different
aspect
of
the
same
law
like
section
2,
eleventh.
for
example,
the
union
is
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
a
man
cannot
make
--
he
cannot
settle
the
terms
of
his
employment,
the
union
does
it.
i
submit
it
maybe
just
as
much
of
an
inducement
to
join
the
union,
to
have
a
direct
voice
in
determining
what
wage
policies
and
hours
policies
and
other
conditions
--
other
objectives
should
be
sought.
that's
quite
an
inducement
to
join
the
union
too,
because
you're
--
you
want
to
get
in
on
the
exclusive
collective
bargaining
representatives.
and
yet,
there
appears
to
be
no
question
--
mr.
milton
kramer
but
in
those
two
--
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
that
--
that
is
not
the
question,
your
honor.
just
indicating
there
are
other
inducements
which
are
perhaps
too
many
people,
more
persuasive
than
the
union
thought.
those
two
cases
did
indicate
that
the
activities
under
attack,
that
is
espousing
political
objectives
in
the
union
publication.
in
the
other
case,
the
uaw
case,
it
was
buying
tv
time
to
espouse
the
virtues
of
a
political
candidate.
that
the
unions
were
engaging
in
activities
they
had
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in.
the
appellees
must
be
saying
here
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
as
to
them,
for
the
unions
to
engage
in
activities
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in.
i
suggest
also
that
if
these
expenditures
violate
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
appellees,
then
many
heretofore
unquestioned
activities
of
the
government
would
also
violate
the
first
amendment
rights
of
various
groups
of
taxpayers.
now,
i
made
this
point
in
our
brief
last
year.
i
made
it
in
oral
argument.
neither
the
solicitor
general
nor
the
appellees
have
seen
fit
to
try
to
answer
it.
i
would
like
to
make
it
again.
the
coercive
power
of
taxation
certainly
is
at
least
as
great
as
the
union
shop.
in
the
case
of
the
union
shop,
the
sanction
is
losing
a
particular
job
with
the
southern
railway.
in
the
case
of
taxation,
you
have
to
pay
taxes
wherever
you
earn
money,
and
if
you
don't
earn
it,
if
you
get
it
some
place
else,
so
long
as
it
is
income,
or
if
you
buy
certain
items,
you
pay.
in
some
jurisdictions
if
you
buy
food,
you
have
to
pay
taxes.
now
what
--
mr.
milton
kramer
mr.
chief
justice,
i
started
before
the
recess
to
point
out
that
if
these
expenditures
by
a
union
can
be
held
to
violate
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
appellees,
then
many
expenditures
of
government
would
also
violate
first
amendment
right
to
expenditures
never
heretofore
question.
for
example,
the
federal
government
spends
money
for
voice
of
america
programs.
now,
there
are
isolationists
who
believe
the
united
states
should
not
tell
people
in
foreign
countries
anything
about
their
internal
government
or
persuade
them
what
to
do.
they
could
say
these
expenditures
impart
from
money
obtained
from
me
through
the
coercive
power
of
taxation
violates
my
first
amendment
rights.
similarly,
the
federal
government
employs
chaplains
in
the
armed
forces
and
elsewhere.
atheists
who
are
taxpayers
could
say,
“my
first
amendment
rights
are
being
abridged,
because
my
money
is
being
used
to
propagate
religion.
examples
could
be
multiplied
almost
indefinitely.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
but
that
was
simply
the
--
that
was
a
suit
for
an
injunction
against
the
activity.
the
court
below
in
this
case
say,
“that
isn't
what
he's
entitled
to.
he's
entitled
to
a
lot
more.
he's
entitled
to
relief
from
texas.
if
the
unions
here
engage
in
anything
that
abridges
his
freedom,
then
he
is
not
relieved
of
that
portion
of
the
union
dues.
the
unions
are
not
to
be
enjoined
against
engaging
in
the
civil
legal
activity.
the
union
shop
can't
be
applied
at
all.”
the
relief
in
that
case
would
be
relief
from
all
taxation.
now
certainly,
the
restrictions
of
the
first
amendment
apply
at
least
as
rigorously
to
action
of
the
government
itself
as
it
does
to
what
are
essentially
private
organizations
that
may
derive
some
benefit
from
some
governmental
plan
of
regulation,
the
appellees
themselves
in
their
brief
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
--
there's
one
thing
i
would
certainly
say
that
that
would
not
relieve
a
democrat
from
all
taxations.
now,
it
may
be
that
such
an
appropriation
is
unconstitutional
and
that
the
expender
of
the
money
could
be
enjoined
from
expending
--
expending
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
he
declined
to
pay
his
taxes?
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
this
is
a
separate
tax
for
that
purpose?
mr.
milton
kramer
con
--
conceivably,
he
could
resist
the
collection
of
the
tax
but
that
isn't
this
case.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
yes,
in
part.
i
mean,
i
play
in
the
solicitor
general's
court
only
if
all
my
other
arguments
are
wrong
that
if
--
mr.
milton
kramer
do
i
recognize
the
distinction?
i
more
than
recognize
it,
i
assert
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
as
justice
black
suggested,
his
remedy
would
be
not
to
pay,
not
to
try
to
enjoin
the
collection,
but
don't
pay
and
resist
the
effort
to
collect.
that's
what
happened
in
this
case
in
substance.
they
wouldn't
come
in
and
they
sued
--
just
to
turn
it
around,
they
sued
to
enjoin
us
from
applying
the
union
shop
agreement.
of
course
we
are
not
immune
from
suit
as
the
federal
government
did.
but
the
remedy
would
be
not
to
pay
and
say,
because
they
are
taking
it
to
an
illegal
activity,
we
don't
have
to
pay.
and
--
don't
pay
anything.
mr.
milton
kramer
three
paid
for
a
part
of
the
time,
three
of
the
others
have
never
paid
anything.
mr.
milton
kramer
we
have
both
kinds.
the
suit
your
honor
was
brought
before
the
agreement
was
effective,
before
they
had
to
join.
there
was
a
preliminary
injunction.
after
a
while,
the
preliminary
injunction
was
dissolved
with
a
supersedeas
for
those
who
had
put
up
a
bond.
three
of
these
six
put
a
bond,
three
did
not.
they
paid.
the
judgment
below
gives
all
three
all
their
money
back.
all
of
it.
now,
as
i
said,
certainly,
the
first
amendment
applies
at
least
as
rigorously
to
the
federal
government.
we
are
an
essentially
private
organization,
perhaps
benefited
in
some
ways
by
federal
legislation.
now,
the
appellees
attempt
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
integrated
bar
case
and
this
one
which
i
think
is
supposed
to
reverse
for
what
it
ought
to
be.
they
say,
the
distinction
is
that
the
integrated
bar
is
an
essentially,
if
not
essentially,
the
integrated
bar
is
a
government
organization
while
the
unions
are
essentially
private
organizations
that
participate
in
a
governmental
plan
of
regulation.
and
therefore,
the
integrated
bar
is
constitutional,
while
this
is
not.
i
would
think
that
therefore,
it
would
be
just
to
reverse.
that
when
the
government
itself
that
is
doing
something
which
is
alleged
to
infringe
first
amendment
rights,
then
that
could
be
unconstitutional
while
this
would
be
constitutional
because
at
--
if
there
is
a
difference,
certainly,
the
first
amendment
applies
at
least
as
much
to
the
government
as
it
does
to
essentially
private
organizations.
i
would
now
like
to
come
over
into
the
solicitor
general's
court.
i
will
--
i
do
not
propose
to
discuss
his
brief
in
detail.
we
would
like
to
reserve
that
until
after
he
has
had
an
opportunity
to
present
his
oral
argument.
but,
i
must
describe
it
briefly
to
go
on
to
what
i
have
to
say.
the
solicitor
general's
position
in
brief
is
that
section
2,
eleventh
is
constitutional,
the
union
shop
agreements
are
valid
agreements,
and
that
this
court
need
not
decide
whether
the
expenditures
violate
anyone's
rights,
because
even
if
they
do
-
he
doesn't
say
they
do
or
do
not
-
but
because,
even
if
they
do,
the
plaintiffs
misconceived
their
remedy
and
the
courts
below
gave
them
a
remedy
to
which
they
are
not
entitled.
now
with
all
the
arguments
mr.
schoene
has
made
and
that
i
have
made
and
that
are
in
our
briefs
which
we
do
not
have
the
time
to
discuss,
if
all
of
those
are
wrong,
all
of
the
arguments
on
their
merits
are
wrong,
then,
nevertheless,
the
decree
below
must
be
reversed,
because
the
plaintiffs
obtained
relief
to
which
they
clearly
are
not
entitled.
that
is
an
injunction
against
the
entire
union
shop.
as
the
solicitor
general
points
out,
there
are
a
great
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
the
solicitor
general
makes
--
makes
various
suggestions
which
i
think
are
somewhat
impractical
but
there
are
possibilities
like
enjoining
the
particular
expenditure,
a
rebate
with
respect
to
the
amount
spent
for
these
improper
purposes.
there
are
a
number
of
possibilities
but
not
declare
the
union
shop
agreement
invalid
because
some
the
money
get
spent
somewhere
you
don't
like.
well,
i
think
justice
douglas,
in
the
uaw
case,
that
is
like,
burning
down
the
house
to
roast
the
pig.
the
solicitor
general
points
out
that
there
are
great
varieties
of
activities
under
question
here.
these
are
--
this
was
just
not
a
political
contribution
case.
they
deny
our
right
to
appear
before
congress
in
favor
of
or
against
bill,
legislation
even
if
invited.
we
can't
do
that
with
their
money.
in
their
last
brief
they
even
say
that,
"oh
yes.
it's
alright
for
us
to
negotiate
an
agreement
to
unemployment
insurance.
it
is
a
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights
for
us
to
appear
before
congress
and
ask
for
it.”
the
congress
has
to
think
of
these
things
sua
sponte
with
only
the
railroads
appearing
on
position.
that's
the
position
they
take
and
that's
the
position
the
court
below
upheld.
mr.
milton
kramer
well
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
not
if
you're
going
to
have
a
union.
i
mean,
it
certainly
cannot
be
alright
for
unions
to
spend
money
to
get
unemployment
in
service
if
they
do
it
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
unconstitutional
if
they
get
exactly
the
same
thing
through
legislation.
many
subjects
of
collective
bargaining
in
non-railroad
industries
are
subject
of
legislation
in
the
railroad
industry.
supplemental
unemployment
insurance
is
one
for
example.
the
reason
for
that
is
the
need
for
uniformity
in
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
the
railroad
industry
throughout
the
country
or
almost
all
the
important
ones
are
national
agreements.
and
when
you
can't
get
it
that
way,
then
you
need
legislation
be,
otherwise,
you're
handicapped
one
competitor
against
the
other
and
it's
been
traditionally
that
way
anyway.
many
subjects
are
bargained
for
in
other
industries
but
are
legislative
matters
in
the
railroad
industry.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
on
this
record
your
honor,
we
have
no
such
case.
we
have
no
--
one
of
--
mr.
milton
kramer
what
--
that
is
what
has
been.
mr.
milton
kramer
that
is
what
has
been.
mr.
milton
kramer
that
is
right.
we
--
we
assert
that
is
our
legal
position.
what
in
--
whether
in
fact
any
such
people
have
been
fired,
the
record
doesn't
show.
mr.
milton
kramer
on
that
basis,
i
think
not.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
think
not.
