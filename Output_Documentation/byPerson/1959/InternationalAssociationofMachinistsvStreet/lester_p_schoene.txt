mr.
lester
p.
schoene
and
if
the
court,
please.
this
case
is
here
as
a
result
of
the
refusal
of
the
courts
of
georgia,
to
accept
and
to
apply
this
court's
decision
in
railway
employes'
department
against
hanson,
351
u.s.
225.
the
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
which
appears
at
the
page
249
of
the
record.
this
court's
jurisdiction
is
based
on
title
28
to
the
united
states
code,
section
1257,
paragraphs
(1)
and
(2).
the
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
october
the
12th,
1959.
now,
this
action
was
begun
in
the
superior
court
of
bibb
county,
georgia
in
june
of
1953.
it
was
removed
to
the
federal
court
and
reposed
there
for
about
three
and
a
half
years
while
litigation
in
other
similar
cases
including
the
hanson
case
involving
the
same
issues
went
forward.
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
hanson
case,
we
consented
to
it's
remand
to
the
superior
court
of
bibb
county,
georgia
where
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed.
i
should
say
that
in
--
in
this
case,
just
as
in
the
hanson
case,
the
nature
of
the
action
was
an
injunction
suit
to
enjoin
the
performance
of
the
union-shop
agreement
made
under
section
2,
eleventh,
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
agreements
involved
are
entirely
identical
except
for
the
name
of
the
carrier
to
the
agreement
that
was
involved
in
the
hanson
case.
a
motion
to
dismiss
based
on
the
hanson
case
was
filed
immediately
after
its
remand
to
the
superior
court
of
bibb
county.
and
on
the
day
of
the
hearing
of
that
motion
to
dismiss,
the
plaintiffs
tendered
an
amendment
to
the
complaint
alleging
that
payments
required
to
be
made
under
the
union-shop
agreement
would
be
used
in
substantial
part
to
support
ideological
and
political
doctrines
and
political
candidates
that
the
plaintiffs
were
not
willing
to
support.
the
court
allowed
the
amendment
to
be
made,
took
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
being
addressed
to
the
amended
complaint
and
on
the
entirety
of
the
hanson
case,
dismissed
the
complaint.
that
decision
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
in
an
opinion
that
appears
at
page
221
of
the
record,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
reversed
the
district
court
indicating
its
complete
disapproval
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
hanson
case,
acknowledging
that
it
was
bound
by
it,
but
that
it
was
willing
to
take
any
possible
distinction
to
avoid
applying
it.
as
consequence
to
that
reversal,
the
case
was
then
tried
in
the
superior
court.
the
facts
as
developed
at
the
trial
to
the
evidence
are
summarized,
as
you
have
undoubtably
noticed,
the
record
is
a
very
voluminous
one.
the
--
the
evidence
is
summarized
in
our
brief
at
pages
11
to
15.
very
briefly,
the
evidence
showed
that
the
unions,
in
addition
to
their
normal
and
predominant
activity
of
negotiating
and
administering
agreements
and
handling
grievances,
do
engage
through
such
institutions
as
the
afl-cio,
the
railway
labor
executives'
association
in
legislative,
political,
and
educational
activities.
and
some
individual
unions
have
legislative
representatives.
they
collectively
participate
in
the
publication
of
the
newspaper
labor.
individual
unions
publish
magazines
in
the
nature
of
house
organs
for
distribution
to
their
membership,
which
contained
political
and
educational
matter
as
well
as
reports
concerning
the
activities
and
goings-on
within
the
union.
and
the
evidence
shows
that
the
general
funds
of
the
unions
from
which
such
activities
are
financed
do
derive
in
substantial
part
from
those
in
the
initiation
fees
that
the
members
pay.
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
assessment
having
been
made
by
any
defendant
union
for
any
purpose
whatever,
nor
that
any
contributions
has
been
required
of
anyone,
for
any
purpose,
other
than
the
regular
normal
dues
and
initiation
fees.
there
is
no
evidence
that
anyone's
conduct,
or
his
expression
or
his
belief
has
been
in
any
way
restrained
or
coerced
or
that
anyone
has
been
required
to
read
anything
or
to
listen
to
anything
or
to
believe
anything.
there
is
no
claim
that
these
expenditures
involved
are
either
ultra
vires
under
the
union's
constitution
or
bylaws
or
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
statute.
now,
it
is
our
position
and
the
sole
point
that
i
intend
to
argue
that
every
issue
in
this
case
was
disposed
of
by
this
court's
opinion
and
decision
in
the
hanson
case.
that
is
discussed
in
our
brief
at
pages
35
and
following.
now,
we
think
in
the
first
place
that
the
court's
language,
although
the
appellees
pick
certain
language
in
the
hanson
opinion
out
of
context
in
the
side
that
the
issues
here
arising,
were
reserved
in
that
opinion,
we
think
the
court
made
it
entirely
clear
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
through
the
mere
expenditure
of
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i've
--
i
have
not,
i'm
sorry
to
say
mr.
justice,
made
a
detailed
comparison
of
the
--
of
the
pleadings
themselves.
i
think,
however,
that
this
--
this
is
a
substantially
responsive
answer
to
your
question.
that
the
--
i
do
not
believe
that
the
hanson
case
had
a
specific
allegation
in
the
pleadings
that
these
moneys
were
expended
for
political
or
legislative
activities.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
in
part,
that's
right.
i
think
the
amendment
made
in
january
1957,
when
the
motion
to
dismiss
came
on,
was
an
addition,
to
substantially
the
pleadings
that
were
in
the
hanson
case.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
is
correct,
but
they
--
the
same
type
of
evidence
was
in
the
hanson
case
and
the
same
contentions
were
made
before
this
court.
now
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no.
no,
it
was
not.
it
used
such
--
it
--
it
used
words
like
ideological
and
term
--
which
words
were
expected,
but
not
in
language
from
the
--
from
the
hanson
opinion.
this
court
said
in
the
hanson
case,
“the
only
conditions
to
union
membership
authorized
by
section
2,
eleventh,
of
the
railway
labor
act
are
the
payment
of
periodic
dues,
initiation
fees
and
assessments.
the
assessments
that
may
be
lawfully
imposed
do
not
include
fines
and
penalties.”
the
financial
support
required
relates
therefore
to
the
work
of
the
union
in
the
realm
of
collective
bargaining.
no
more
precise
allocation
of
union
overhead
to
individual
members
seems
to
us
to
be
necessary.
the
prohibition
of
fines
and
penalties
precludes
the
imposition
of
financial
burdens
for
disciplinary
purposes.
if
assessments
are,
in
fact,
imposed
for
the
purposes
not
to
mind
the
collective
bargaining,
a
different
problem
would
be
presented
and
it
is
certainly
indicated
that
the
word,
“assessments”
was
used
in
its
precise
meaning
because
the
footnote
to
that
sentence
refers
to
constitutional
provisions
that
are
described
as
giving
very
broad
powers
of
assessment.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no,
there
is
none,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
not,
so
far
as
i
know.
i
know
of
no
instance
in
which
that
occurs
in
this
country.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment
rights,
this
court
said
in
the
hanson
case,
"if
--
if
other
conditions
are
in
fact
imposed
or
if
the
exaction
of
dues,
initiation
fees
or
assessments
is
used
as
a
cover
for
forcing
ideological
conformity
or
other
action
in
contravention
of
the
first
amendment,
this
judgment
will
not
prejudice
the
decision
in
that
case."
now,
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
any
imposition
has
been
made
or
any
exaction
made
other
than
the
requirement
for
the
payment
of
dues
and
initiation
fees,
and
there
has
been
no
cover
for
anything,
not
a
bit
of
evidence
to
indicate
that
any
requirement
of
payment
was
used
for
anything
other
than
to
finance
the
regular
activities
of
the
union.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
the
corrupt
practices
act
as
amended
by
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
it
--
it
limits
the
purposes
for
which
expenditures
can
be
made
or
dealt
with.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
--
that
is
correct.
that
it
--
that
--
that
is
a
very
definite
implication
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
and
as
i
have
stated,
there
is
no
claim
here
that
either
the
corrupt
practices
act
or
any
other
statute
was
violated.
now,
if
the
language
that
i
have
referred
through
or
to
were
not
in
itself
determinative
of
what
this
court
decided
in
the
hanson
case,
it
becomes
perfectly
apparent
what
this
court
was
doing
in
the
hanson
case
when
you
refer
to
this
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
in
that
case.
we
have
quoted
on
pages
35
to
36
of
our
brief
what
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
said
in
that
case.
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
precisely
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
has
said
it's
unconstitutional.
namely,
they
said,
that
assuming
that
it
is
proper
to
require
every
individual
who
gets
the
benefit
of
collective
bargaining
to
contribute
to
the
cost
of
collective
bargaining,
when
you
require
union
membership
and
require
the
payment
of
full
dues
and
initiation
fees,
you
are
paying
for
something
other
because
the
union's
engaged
in
other
activities.
and
that
was
the
precise
holding
of
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
that
was
reversed
by
this
court
in
that
case.
further,
if
you
consult
the
record
and
the
briefs
before
this
court
in
the
hanson
case,
you
will
find
that
the
major
contention
before
this
court
was
precisely
the
contention
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
has
sustained
in
this
case.
we
have
set
forth
at
pages
37
and
38
of
our
brief
references
to
the
record
and
briefs
in
the
hanson
case
showing
that
to
be
the
fact.
not
only,
however,
was
this
contention
made
in
the
argument
before
this
court
in
the
hanson
case,
after
your
decision
came
down,
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
apparently
felt
that
you
had
overlooked
the
significance
of
these
contributions
or
these
expenditures
for
political
and
legislative
purposes.
so,
they
filed
with
you
a
motion
to
stay
a
mandate
saying,
"they
were
going
to
file
a
petition
for
rehearing,"
which
could
not
be
heard
at
that
time
and
since
the
mandate
would
otherwise
go
down
during
vacation,
they
asked
for
a
stay
of
mandate.
bringing
these
very
arguments
to
your
attention
again,
that
motion
to
stay
a
mandate
was
denied
on
june
11,
1956.
the
counsel
for
the
--
for
hanson,
nevertheless,
filed
the
motion
for
rehearing.
at
same
time,
they
proceeded
in
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
with
a
motion
to
stay
or
with
the
motion
to
enter
judgment
on
the
mandate
consisting
of
the
retention
of
a
limited
injunction
prohibiting
precisely
what
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
has
here
said,
cannot
be
done.
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
received
briefs
and
arguments
on
that
motion
and
having
heard
it,
determined
that
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
the
hanson
case
required
not
the
retention
of
a
limited
injunction,
but
a
dismissal
of
the
case.
and
on
october,
the
--
on
october,
the
--
no,
i
don't
have
the
exact
date,
but
it's
in
--
in
october
of
1956.
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
entered
its
judgment
on
the
mandate
directing
dismissal
of
the
case.
in
the
meantime,
on
october
8,
of
that
same
year,
which
i
believe
was
the
first
day
the
court
was
in
session
in
that
time
you
denied
the
motion
for
rehearing.
now,
similarly,
efforts
to
construe
the
hanson
case
as
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
had
construed
it,
were
made
in
moore
against
the
c&o
railroad
company,
reported
at
198
virginia
273
where
a
motion
for
rehearing
based
on
the
motion
for
rehearing
pending
in
this
court
and
the
hanson
case
was
made
that
that
was
denied
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
in
sandsberry
against
international
association
of
machinists,
295
s.w.
2d
412
in
which
you
denied
certiorari
353
u.s.
918,
the
same
matters
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
concluded
that
this
court
had
full
cognizance
of
all
of
these
facts
relating
to
the
nature
of
the
activities
and
the
nature
of
the
expenditures
that
unions
make
at
the
time
it
decided
the
hanson
case
and
had
authoritatively
disposed
of
it.
finally,
in
a
more
recent
case,
allen
against
southern
railway
company
involving
these
same
agreements
on
the
same
railroad,
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
at
259
n.c.
491
made
an
analysis
of
the
decision
in
the
hanson
case
and
we
quote
at
page
42
of
our
brief
from
what
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
concluded.
the
court
there
said
“the
very
questions
now
raised
by
plaintiffs
were
before
the
court
and
decided
in
hanson
and
that
the
words
upon
which
plaintiffs
rely
when
read
in
context
do
not
support
their
contention.”
now,
i
must
say
that
that
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
was
rendered
after
the
first
appeal
in
this
case
and
with
knowledge
of
what
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
had
said.
however,
following
the
second
appeal,
it
has
granted
a
motion
for
reconsideration
and
has
not
yet
decided
on
that
motion.
it
is
under
consideration
by
the
supreme
court.
now,
that
is
the
only
point
i'm
going
to
argue
when
my
colleague,
mr.
kramer,
will
discuss
further
issues
on
the
assumption
that
everything
i
have
said
is
wrong
and
that
the
hanson
case
has
not
disposed
of
the
issues
here.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
and
if
the
court
please.
i
don't
know
that
it's
actually
material
but
i
think
mr.
gambrell
is
in
error
when
he
says
that
it
was
alleged
in
the
removal
petition
that
each
of
the
individual
plaintiffs
had
an
interest
of
in
excess
of
$3000.
what
was
alleged
what
was
--
that
the
total
amount
in
controversy
was
in
excess
of
$3000
which,
of
course,
involved
what
the
whole
state
of
the
union
in
not
having
the
--
the
injunction
issue.
the
motion
to
remand
was
consented
to
because
we
had
lost
similar
motions
and
at
least
a
half
a
dozen
federal
courts
didn't
see
any
point
in
litigating
it
again.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no,
the
--
the
courts
that
remanded
said
that
there
was
no
federal
question
jurisdiction
and
we
didn't
claim
diversity.
i
still
think
there
was
but
that's
water
over
the
dam.
that
mr.
gambrell
says
that
i
looked
in
the
wrong
place
but
--
and
perhaps
he's
right.
and
--
now
i
--
i
would
like
for
a
moment
to
discuss
the
hanson
case
a
little
further.
mr.
gambrell
claims
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
hanson
case
about
the
use
of
moneys
for
political
or
legislative
purposes.
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
had
said
what
it
did
if
it
had
no
evidence
at
all.
now,
it
is
true
that
that
action
was
brought
before
the
union-shop
agreement
had
actually
become
effective
and
consequently
an
injunction
issued
in
the
nebraska
courts
before
there
was
any
opportunity
to
show
that
individual
persons
had
been
required
to
join
the
union
and
their
particular
money
had
been
used
for
any
of
these
purposes.
but
the
record
in
the
hanson
case
did
show
the
constitutions
and
bylaws
of
the
unions
and
showed
their
authorization
for
making
such
expenditures.
it
showed
the
nature
of
the
newspaper
labor
on
the
extent
to
which
it
engages
in
political
activity
and
it
showed
the
relationship
of
that
newspaper
to
these
organizations.
on
the
basis
of
the
record
as
it
stood
in
the
hanson
case,
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
said,
this
is
particularly
true
as
to
whether
the
latter
because
it
is
apparent
that
some
of
these
labor
organizations
advocate
political
ideas,
support
political
candidates
and
advice
national
economic
concepts
which
may
or
may
not
be
of
an
employee's
choice.
it
further
said
a
little
later
on
by
requiring
him
to
pay
initiation
fees,
dues
and
assessments,
he
is
required
to
pay
for
many
things
besides
the
cost
of
collective
bargaining.
to
--
a
little
later
on
to
require
all
employees
receiving
benefits
from
collective
bargaining
agreements
to
pay
the
labor
organizations
obtaining
them,
initiation
fees,
dues
and
assessments
is
to
require
them
to
make
contributions
to
any
and
all
of
the
varied
objects
and
undertakings
in
which
such
labor
organizations
are
or
may
become
engaged
and
which
have
no
substantial
relation
to
the
object
here
sought
to
be
obtained.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
--
that
you're
trying
to
say
that
it
was
decided.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
do
not
read
the
caveats
to
which
you
refer
mr.
justice
as
reserving
the
question
of
whether
the
requirement
and
only
the
requirement
of
paying
dues,
the
regular
dues
and
initiation
fees
and
their
expenditure
by
the
union
as
authorized
under
the
union
constitution.
i
do
not
read
the
caveat
as
saying
that
any
question
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
that
action
is
reserved
or
maybe
i
have
misread
it.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
think
what
--
well
there
were
two
things
that
were
reserved,
i
mean.
to
take
the
exact
language
if
other
conditions
are
in
fact
imposed
now,
that
--
that
perhaps
i
should
go
back
to
the
sentence
in
two
parts.
it
is
argued
that
compulsory
membership
will
be
used
to
impair
freedom
of
expression,
but
that
problem
is
not
presented
by
this
record.
that
problem
meant
--
that
congress
endeavored
to
safeguard
against
that
possibility
by
making
explicit
that
no
conditions
to
membership
may
be
required
except
as
respects
periodic
dues,
initiation
fees
and
assessments.
if
other
conditions
are
in
fact
imposed
or
if
the
exaction
of
dues,
initiation
fees
or
assessments
is
used
as
a
cover
for
forcing
ideological
conformity
or
other
action
in
contravention
of
the
first
amendment,
this
judgment
will
not
prejudice
the
decision
in
that
case.
how
i
read
that
domain
for
example,
but
if
mr.
gambrell
points
out,
he
has
copies
of
oath
and
obligations
that
individuals
might
be
required
to
take
in
order
to
join
a
union,
if
those
are
imposed
as
conditions
and
addition
for
the
payment
of
initiation
fees,
dues
and
assessments,
then
a
different
question
is
presented.
and
we
have
no
instance
here,
no
evidence
of
anyone
being
required
to
take
any
other
any
sort
of
oath,
go
through
any
kind
of
ceremony
or
express
himself
in
any
way.
all
that
is
shown
is
that
they
are
required
to
pay
the
dues,
fees
and
the
assessments
regularly
required
as
a
condition
of
obtaining
or
retaining
membership.
and
that
i
read
the
hanson
case,
as
having
held
does
not
give
rise
to
any
constitutional
infringements
under
the
first
or
the
fifth
amendment
because
certainly
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
not
only
what
the
nebraska
supreme
court
had
decided
but
that
these
moneys
were
used
in
these
ways.
it
was
not
only
--
we
have
included
in
our
brief
at
page
37
references
to
the
record
and
to
the
brief
in
which
those
things
were
presented
to
this
court,
not
only
in
the
initial
argument,
but
as
i
stated
earlier
in
the
--
in
the
motion
to
stay
the
mandate
and
again
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
and
then
the
same
contention
was
made
to
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
that
these
issues
had
been
left
open
and
that
therefore
a
limited
injunction
should
be
put
into
effect.
and
you
denied
them
the
motion
to
stay
a
mandate,
you
denied
the
petition
for
rehearing,
and
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
ordered
the
case
dismissed.
now,
i
think
the
analogy
of
the
integrated
bar
although
mr.
gambrell
has
tried
to
distinguish
it,
is
very
close.
and
it
is
not
true
that
members
of
the
integrated
bars
don't
object
to
the
kinds
of
activities
that
the
bar
association
engages
in.
they
have
a
case
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no,
i
think
not.
there
--
there
was
a
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
decided
early
this
month
april
5,
1960
in
which
the
--
a
--
a
member
of
the
integrated
bar
was
suing
the
adviser
of
the
association
because
an
objective
to
the
political
activities
in
which
the
bar
association
was
engaged.
the
court
said
the
rules
and
bylaws
of
the
state
bar
as
approved
by
this
court
do
not
compel
the
plaintiff
to
associate
with
anyone.
he
is
free
to
attend
or
not
to
attend
its
meetings
or
vote
in
its
elections
as
he
chooses.
the
only
compulsion
to
which
he
has
been
subjected
by
the
integration
of
the
bar
is
the
payment
of
the
annual
dues
of
$15
per
year.
he
is
as
free
as
he
was
before.
the
voice
his
views
on
any
subject,
in
any
manner
he
wishes,
even
though
such
views
be
diametrically
opposed
to
a
position
taken
by
the
state
law.
now,
that
is
just
as
true
of
a
member
of
the
union
that
is
required
to
belong
under
a
union-shop
as
it
is
of
members
of
the
state
bar.
and
while
the
bar
may
be
a
different
profession
from
a
common
calling
as
i
submit
that
members
of
the
bar
of
justice,
has
definite
first
amendment
rights
as
railroad
employees.
again
in
the
same
decision
the
--
that
the
court
said
the
plaintiff
balanced
his
argument
that
the
compulsory
dues
of
the
state
bar
do
impinge
upon
first
amendment
freedoms
on
the
fact
that
the
state
bar
does
take
a
stand
on
legislation
pending
before
the
legislature.
he
points
out
that
he
personally
is
opposed
to
some
of
the
legislations
supported
by
it.
because
of
this,
he
contends
his
right
as
guaranteed
from
the
first
amendment,
were
violated
because
part
of
his
dues
money
is
used
to
support
causes
to
which
he
is
opposed.
whatever
activity
in
the
legislative
field
in
which
state
bar
does
engage
is
limited
by
its
rules
and
bylaws
promulgated
by
the
court
to
all
the
standing
committees
and
so
on.
the
board
of
governors
is
directed
to
establish
right
before
the
committee
on
administration
of
justice
and
committee
on
legislation
was
on
to
show
that
the
--
the
processes,
the
internal
processes
by
which
policy
is
determined
or
profitable
processes.
so,
i
--
i
think
the
--
that
the
exact
same
arguments
that
are
made
here
were
made
in
connection
with
the
integrated
bar
but
as
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
it's
not
been
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes,
that
--
that
was
decided
on
the
fifth
of
april
of
this
year.
now
with
respect
to
the
actual
operations
and
political
activities,
i
think
it
might
be
useful
to
note
particularly
finding
or
the
stipulation
number
29
which
appears
at
page182
of
the
record.
there,
there
is
a
description
of
how
railway
labors
politically
operates
and
that
it
describes
the
two
separate
funds
that
are
used.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
so-called
educational
fund,
that
is
the
only
place
in
which
any
dues
moneys
are
contributed.
moneys
that
are
used
in
political
campaigns
to
support
political
candidates
come
out
of
the
so
called
free
fund
which
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
free
fund
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
--
which
is
derived
entirely
from
voluntary
contributions.
now,
that
is
done
because
primarily
as
a
means
of
observing
the
corrupt
practices
act
because
we
recognize
that
under
that
act
we
cannot
use
any
of
--any
of
the
funds
derived
from
dues
for
any
candidates
for
federal
office.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
subscriptions
to
labor
come
out
of
the
educational
fund
and
have
their
origin
in
the
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
--
in
the
used
funds,
moneys.
yes.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
oh,
not
--
no,
not
at
all.
i
--
i
simply
thought
it
was
desirable
that
the
court
have
an
understanding
of
what
the
operation
is.
in
other
words,
an
individual
is
not
required
simply,
has
an
identified
portion
of
these
dues
to
make
any
contributions
for
political
purposes.
he
pays
his
dues.
the
--
the
local
either
retains
or
gets
back
from
the
international
a
certain
portion
of
it,
the
international
gets
a
certain
portion
of
it.
the
international
pays
a
per
capita
of
five
cents
per
member
per
month
to
the
afl-cio.
eventually
the
afl-cio
engages
in
some
political
or
legislative
activity
that
--
that
is
financed
by
the
money
derived
in
this
way.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
several
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
don't
believe
that
they
have.
now
the
machinists
operate
a
--
a
separate
political
league
and
i
think
they
have
a
full-time
employee
in
charge
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
it
--
it
is
operated
as
i
understand
with
mr.
--
i
guess
the
record
shows
the
--
in
same
way
as
railway
labors
political
league
they
have
one
fund
of
--
of
voluntary
contributions
and
others
that
are
used
for
educational
purposes
and
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
they
come
out
of
the
general
funds.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
think
it's
in
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes.
and
in
--
in
--
at
pages
195
and
196
of
the
record,
the
--
that
the
sources
are
indicated.
it
says
contributions
into
the
so-called
educational
fund
to
the
national
machinist
non-partisan
league
has
been
made
as
follows,
they
are
in
--
in
headquarters
in
1937
or
1957
$10,000,
district
and
local
lodges
the
i.a.m.
$41,112.
now,
that
--
that
is
the
educational
money
which
comes
from
dues.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
about
900,000.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
in
--
well,
in
1957,
it
was
$51,112.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
oh,
that
i
do
not
know.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well
it's
in
the
900,000
members.
the
dues
rate
is
shown
in
the
record.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
mr.
chief
justice,
may
the
court
please.
in
view
of
the
extensive
consideration
that
this
case
has
already
received
at
the
last
term,
i
will
not
burden
the
court
with
any
detail
recital
of
its
prior
procedural
history.
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
the
court's
opinion
is
found
in
the
record
at
page
249
and
the
judgment
it
entered
at
page
270
of
the
record.
that
judgment
affirmed
the
final
judgment
of
the
superior
court
of
bibb
county,
georgia,
which
is
found
at
page
101
of
the
record.
the
superior
court
found
that
section
2,
(eleventh)
of
the
railway
labor
act,
that
is
the
statute
of
19
--
january,
1951,
which
authorized
union
shop
agreements
to
be
made
or
permitted
union
shop
agreements
to
be
made
between
railroad
subject
to
that
act
and
labor
unions
subject
to
that
act.
the
superior
court
found
that
section
of
the
law
to
be
unconstitutional.
it
therefore
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
two
union
shop
agreements
on
the
rail
--
on
the
southern
railroad,
each
embracing
some
eleven,
twelve
different
organizations,
enjoined
their
enforcement
permanently.
those
agreements
are
identical
in
terminology
except
for
reference
to
parties
with
the
union
shop
agreement
that
was
before
this
court
in
railway
employes'
department
against
hanson,
351
u.s.
225
in
which
this
court
unanimously
sustained
the
validity
of
section
2,
eleventh
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
upheld
the
validity
of
the
agreements
made
pursuant
to
them.
and
which,
as
i
say,
was
identical
to
the
agreements
here
involved.
now,
i
would
like
first
to
address
myself
in
summary
form
to
the
facts
that
were
developed
in
this
very
exhaustive
and
voluminous
record.
the
evidence
in
the
trial
court
shows,
and
these
facts
are
stated
a
little
more
at
length
in
our
original
brief
at
pages
11
to
15.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
we
filed
a
response
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief
and
a
further
replied
to
the
brief
on
reargument
filed
by
the
appellees.
the
evidence
in
the
case
shows
that
these
unions,
who
are
defendants
in
the
case,
in
addition,
to
their
normal
and
predominant
function
on
activities
of
negotiating
rates
of
pay,
rules,
working
conditions,
collective
bargaining
agreements
of
various
sorts,
administering
such
agreements,
policing
them,
handling
grievances
under
them.
in
addition
to
that,
they
do
engage
in
certain
other
activities
through
such
institutions
as
the
american
federation
of
labor-cio,
the
railway
labor
executives
association,
railway
labor's
political
league.
they
engage
in
various
legislative
and
political
activities,
educational
activities,
and
some
of
the
individual
unions
support
from
time,
legislative
representatives
at
both
state
and
national
levels,
whose
function
is
to
promote
or
oppose
legislation
pending
before
congress
or
the
state
legislatures.
collectively,
they
participate
in
the
publication
of
the
newspaper
labor
which
advocates
various
ideas
and
promotes
various
processes
and
publishes
news
selectively
addressed
to
people
interested
in
labor.
the
individual
organizations
also
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no,
it's
a
weekly.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
and
in
addition,
these
organizations
have
their
own
individual
magazine,
generally
published
monthly.
in
those
magazines,
they
publish
news
of
interest
to
their
membership
and
advocate
various
political
and
educational
objectives.
the
funds
that
are
used
for
these
purposes,
subscriptions
to
newspaper
labor
sometimes
which
were
bought
by
the
unions,
derived
from
the
general
dues,
initiation
fees
and
--
of
the
unions.
insofar
as
assessments
are
concerned,
although
the
union
shop
agreement
and
section
2,
eleventh
of
the
railway
labor
act,
both
refer
to
membership
being
conditioned
only
upon
the
payment
of
the
uniform,
fees,
dues,
and
assessments,
regularly
required
as
a
condition
of
membership.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
any
assessments
have
ever
been
levied
by
any
of
these
unions
for
any
purpose.
further,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
anybody
--
that
anybody's
thinking,
anybody's
expression
has
been,
in
any
way,
controlled
or
coerced.
there's
no
evidence
that
anybody
has
been
required
to
attend
any
meetings.
there's
no
captive
audience
involved.
there's
no
evidence
that
anybody
has
been
required
to
read
anything
or
to
listen
to
anything
or
to
refrain
in
any
way
from
expressing
himself
on
any
subject
with
complete
freedom
in
writing
or
orally,
or
any
place
that
he
may
want
to
express
himself.
there's
no
evidence
that
anyone
has
been
required
to
conform
to
any
of
that
similar
idea.
there's
no
evidence
that
anybody
has
been
required
to
profess
as
his,
the
views
expressed
by
the
individual
unions.
further,
there
is
no
claim
that
any
of
the
expenditures
made
by
the
unions
for
any
of
these
purposes
are
ultra
vires
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
the
union.
or
that
they
are
illegal
under
any
state
or
federal
law.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
claim
that
the
corrupt
practices
act
has
been
violated
in
any
of
the
political
activities.
insofar
as
contributions
to
candidates
for
federal
office
are
concerned,
those
are
made
not
from
union
funds
as
the
record
shows.
they
are
made
from
funds
voluntarily
contributed
by
individual
members.
so,
insofar
as
claims
under
the
first
amendment
are
concerned
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
certainly,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no,
not
by
assessment
but
by
voluntary
contributions,
insofar
as
candidates
for
federal
office
is
concerned
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
--
which
is
what
is
governed
by
the
federal
corrupt
practices
act.
union
dues
are
used
for
–
or
union
funds
are
used,
occasionally
at
state
and
local
levels
where
it's
permissible
under
state
and
federal
law
to
use
the
union
funds
for
that
purpose.
but
so
far
as
the
contributions
to
which
the
federal
corrupt
practices
act
is
addressed,
is
concerned,
that
is
handled
entirely
by
a
voluntary
contribution
of
individuals.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right.
otherwise
what
they
--
and
the
point
i
was
making
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
there
is
no
claim
here
–
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
--
of
a
violation
of
the
act
or
ultra
vires
expenditures.
so,
insofar
as
any
claim
of
violation
of
first
amendment
rights
is
concerned,
necessarily
the
case
comes
down
to
the
question
of
whether
the
mere
expenditure
of
union
funds.
legally
expended
for
promoting
ideas
with
which
a
contributor,
under
union
shop
agreement,
disagrees,
whether
that
violates
his
freedom
of
expression
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
that
is
what
you
held
was
constitutional
in
the
hanson
case.
and
i
want
now
to
address
myself
to
the
applicability
of
the
hanson
case
to
the
issues
that
are
here
before
the
court
now.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
got
it
at
some
length
last
spring,
mr.
justice
that
the
hanson
case
did
decide
this
case.
the
fact
that
the
court
ordered
reargument
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
obvious
--
obviously
the
fact
that
the
court
set
the
case
for
reargument
indicates
that
i
was
not
wholly
successful
in
persuading
the
court
to
that
effect
last
spring.
but
i
do
want
to
discuss
the
extent
to
which
the
hanson
case
is
applicable
here.
now
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
hanson
case,
i
argued
in
that
case
that
union
shop
agreements
notwithstanding
section
2,
eleventh
of
the
railway
labor
act
are
simply
private
agreements
between
private
institutions,
the
railroad
and
the
union.
and
that
the
government
is
not
involved
in
their
execution,
they
have
simply
that
permitted
them.
the
court
didn't
agree
with
me
on
that.
and
the
court
held
in
the
hanson
case
that
the
union
shop
agreement
has
the
imprimatur
of
federal
law
upon
it,
particularly
because
it
overrides
state
law
to
the
contrary,
because
the
section
2,
eleventh
overrides
state
law
to
the
contrary.
accordingly,
we
naturally
must
now
proceed
on
the
premise
that
the
making
of
the
union
shop
agreement
and
the
requirement
that
dues
and
initiation
fees
be
paid
pursuant
to
such
agreement
involves
governmental
action
upon
which
constitutional
limitations
must
bear.
still,
i
think
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
do
not
have
any
such
conception,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
it's
one
of
the
vaguest
terms
that
has
entered
this
kind
of
litigation.
and
that
brings
me
to
exactly
the
next
point
that
i
want
to
make.
it's
assuming
as
we
must
that
there
is
this
concept
of
governmental
action
involved.
we
set
--
in
appraising
it,
we
certainly
cannot
assume
that
the
compulsion
is
of
the
same
character
as
a
statutory
mandate.
the
--
there
is
no
law
that
says,
you
must
belong
to
a
union.
there
is
no
law
that
says,
you
must
belong
to
a
union
if
you
want
to
work
for
the
railroad.
this
is
still
a
contract
even
though
subject,
as
this
court
has
held,
to
certain
constitutional
limitations.
analytically,
nevertheless,
it
is
a
condition
of
employment
negotiated
by
a
collective
bargaining
agent
for
the
entire
craft
or
class.
now,
we
have
people
who
would
prefer
to
work
seven
days
a
week
at
straight
time
or
10
or
12
hours
a
day
at
straight
time.
if
they
want
to
work
for
a
railroad
that
has
the
40-hour
a
week
agreement,
five-day
a
week
agreement,
they
can't
do
that.
one
of
the
conditions
of
employment
is
that
the
basic
day
of
eight
hours
applies.
and
according
to
this,
they
have
to
work
at
overtime
after
that.
and
if
the
carrier
doesn't
want
to
work
them
at
overtime,
they
don't
work.
same
is
true
if
they're
working
on
their
rest
days.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
on
their
rest
days.
if
they
want
to
work
on
their
rest
day,
the
railroad
has
to
pay
him
time
and
the
half,
and
the
chances
are
they
won't
work,
although
they
might
want
to
work.
in
this
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i'm
not
speaking
of
the
result
of
wilson
against
new,
mr.
justice
frankfurter;
i'm
speaking
of
a
national
agreement
that
was
made
among
the
nonoperating
union
and
the
railroads
in
1949.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well
that's
--
that's
a
different
matter.
the
8-hour
a
day
i'm
talking
about
is
the
result.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right.
now
similarly,
if
an
individual
wants
to
work
for
a
railroad
that
has
a
union
shop
agreement,
one
of
the
conditions
of
his
employment
is
that
he
joins
the
union
within
the
time
specified
by
the
--
by
the
agreement.
but
that
is
the
only
compulsion.
he
has
a
choice
not
to
work
there
if
he
doesn't
want
to.
just
as
he
has
a
choice
to
work
seven
days
a
week,
some
place
where
they
don't
have
a
5-day
a
week
agreement.
further,
i
think
we
should
keep
in
mind
in
appraising
the
effect
of
federal
law
in
this
situation
that
the
georgia
right
to
work
law
does
not
apply
to
railroads.
so
that
the
situation
that
existed
in
nebraska
where
the
possibility
of
applying
the
--
or
making
the
union
shop
agreement
was
dependent
upon
overriding
state
law
does
not
exist
in
georgia.
now
i
make
no
particular
point
of
that
but
i
bring
it
to
your
attention
for
what
it
may
be.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
the
supreme
court
held
that
it
would
be
illegal
in
georgia
without
the
federal
statute.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
think
you
probably
do,
mr.
justice
black,
although,
the
statute
is
pretty
plain
on
its
face,
and
the
georgia's
court
did
not,
as
i
recall,
hold
that
the
georgia
statute
applied.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
mr.
justice
black
i
don't
want
to
take
the
time
to
pursue
it.
we
have
an
argument
in
our
brief
that
holding
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
under
these
circumstances
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
now,
the
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
don't
say
i
--
we
are
on
limited
time
and
i
don't
want
to
pursue
it.
it's
in
the
brief
and
-
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
mentioned
it
only
because
of
the
reliance
in
hanson
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
i
mentioned
it
mr.
justice
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
mentioned
it
only
because
in
hanson,
the
opinion
does
direct
to
the
fact
that
the
federal
law
overrides
the
laws
of
the
various
states.
and
therefore,
the
union
shop
agreement
has
the
imprimatur
of
federal
law
upon
it.
now,
i
don't
think
that
was
necessary
to
the
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
--
to
the
holding,
but
in
any
event
to
that
degree
in
my
view,
the
georgia,
statute
having
excepted
railroad,
is
different
from
the
situation
in
nebraska.
now,
that's
as
far
as
i
care
to
pursue
it.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
now,
i
want
to
come
to
a
further
aspect
in
the
case.
we
have
assumed
that
the
making
of
the
union
shop
agreement
and
the
requirement
that
dues
and
initiation
fees
be
paid
is
subject
to
constitutional
limitations.
but
the
court
certainly
decided
in
hanson,
at
least
that
that
activity,
that
the
requirement
of
membership
in
the
organizations,
payment
of
dues
and
initiation
fees,
was
a
valid
activity.
now,
does
it
follow
that
because
that
valid
activity
is
subject
to
constitutional
limitations,
that
the
expenditure
of
the
funds,
after
they
have
been
acquired,
after
they
have
become
the
property
of
the
union,
that
that
too
is
subject
to
constitutional
limitations?
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
follow.
the
unions
remain
private
institutions.
the
government
didn't
create
unions.
these
unions
were
in
existence
even
long
before
there
was
a
railway
labor
act
to
protect
them
in
certain
respects
against
the
employer
interference
and
things
of
that
sort.
the
government
doesn't
authorize
them
to
spend
the
money.
to
be
sure,
in
certain
respects
such
as
the
corrupt
practices
act,
the
government
has
limited
the
way
they
can
spend
their
money.
but
so
far
as
the
basic
authority
to
make
expenditures
is
concerned,
that
derives
from
the
constitution
and
bylaws
which
are
controlled
by
the
majority
of
the
membership.
the
government
isn't
the
one
who
says
for
what
they
may
spend
their
money
except
just
the
government
has
seen
fit
to
limit.
so
i
would
urge
for
your
consideration
that
the
mere
expenditure
of
money,
even
though
acquired
as
a
result
of
the
union
shop
agreement
does
not
have
the
imprimatur
of
federal
law
upon
it,
and
that
the
line
should
be
drawn
as
between
the
making
of
the
agreement
which
you've
held
to
be
valid,
although
subject
to
constitutional
limitations,
and
the
expenditures
of
funds
which
does
not
involved
the
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i'm
suggesting
nothing
of
this
sort
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
certainly.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
all
what
i
said
was
they
are
not
subject
to
constitutional
limitation
as
governmental
action.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
and
that's
a
different
thing.
certainly
there's
a
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
mr.
justice
black,
my
associate
mr.
kramer
is
going
to
discuss
the
issue
on
the
assumption
that
constitutional
limitations
do
apply
to
the
expenditures.
i
have
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
is
not,
certainly
not
the
question
before
you
mr.
justice.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
mr.
justice
frankfurter
if
you
were
to
agree
with
me,
which
you
quite
obviously
do
not,
that
the
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
let
me
finish
my
sentence
please.
if
you
were
to
agree
with
me
that
the
expenditure
of
money
by
unions
in
no
way
involves
the
government.
and
therefore,
constitutional
limitations
do
not
apply
to
the
mere
expenditure
of
money.
never
mind
now
what
rights
the
union
member
may
have,
he
has
plenty
of
them
to
challenge
the
most
ultra
vires.
but
as
i
said
at
the
outset
there's
no
ultra
vires
question
in
this
case.
but
if
you
would
agree
with
me
that
the
constitutional
limitations
do
not
apply
to
the
mere
expenditure
of
money,
that
would
be
in
and
of
itself
a
sufficient
ground
on
which
to
reverse
the
judgment
below.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
what
you
had
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
will
conclude
my
remarks
at
this
time.
mr.
kramer
will
continue.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
during
the
discussions
yesterday,
there
were
a
number
of
references
from
both
sides
of
the
bench,
i
think
perhaps
inadvertent,
to
assessments
being
made
for
political
uses.
i
think
i
made
it
clear
in
my
original
argument
that
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
any
assessments
of
any
sort.
so
far
as
this
record
shows,
none
of
the
defendant
unions
has
ever
made
any
assessment
for
any
purpose.
the
expenditures
that
we
are
concerned
with
here
are
expenditures
from
general
union
funds
derived
from
various
sources,
including
initiation
fees
and
dues,
but
also
including
returns
on
investments
of
accumulated
funds
and
other
items
of
income
of
that
sort.
in
any
event
to
the
extent
that
members
under
a
union-shop
contribute
to
those
funds,
the
contributions
involved
are
only
the
regular
initiation
fees
and
dues
uniformly
required
as
a
condition
of
acquiring
or
maintaining
membership.
now,
i
think
it's
particularly
important
to
bear
that
in
mind,
because
in
a
question
addressed
to
mr.
kramer
yesterday,
mr.
justice
black
closed,
a
hypothetical
situation
of
a
statute
of
congress
levying
a
special
tax
for
the
purpose
of
raising
funds
to
support
one
political
party
or
the
other.
in
order
to
make
that
question
analogous
to
any
issue
in
this
case,
the
special
tax
would
have
to
be
eliminated
and
the
question
posed
relate
to
an
appropriation
out
of
the
general
revenues.
now,
i
would
still
think
that
such
an
appropriation
was
invalid,
but
i
think
not
because
of
the
first
amendment,
but
because
it
would
exceed
the
function
or
the
purposes
enumerated
in
the
constitution
for
which
congress
has
authority
to
appropriate
money,
broad
as
those
purposes
are.
in
other
words,
that
would
be
analogous
to
an
ultra
vires
expenditures
on
the
part
of
the
union.
and
as
i
also
pointed
out
yesterday,
there
is
no
claim
of
expenditures
ultra
vires
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
the
union
or
in
violation
of
federal
or
state
law.
now
mr.
gambrell
also
referred
in
his
argument,
if
i
understood
him
correctly,
to
the
unions
disciplining
their
members
to
think
as
the
union
thinks.
i
think
those
were
the
--
approximately
the
words
he
used.
now,
nothing
of
that
sort
is
involved
in
this
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
section
2,
eleventh
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
terms
of
the
union-shop
agreements
here
involved.
the
agreement
may
not
be
applied
to
anyone
to
whom
membership
is
not
available
or
if
they
are
on
the
same
terms
and
conditions
as
generally
applicable,
or
for
whom
membership
is
denied
or
terminated
for
any
reason
other
than
his
failure
to
pay
the
periodic
dues,
fees,
and
assessments
uniformly
required
as
a
condition
of
maintaining
membership.
similarly
now,
mr.
gambrell
this
morning,
spoke
of
the
publications
that
are
forced
upon
these
individuals.
well,
they're
not
forced
upon
and
they
don't
have
to
look
at
them,
they
--
this
is
like
saying,
the
postmaster
general
forces
the
junk
mail
that
is
delivered
to
my
mailbox
on
me.
any
of
these
people
were
free
to
do
with
union
publications
exactly
what
i
do
with
the
junk
mail.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
i
pay
taxes
that
help
absorb
the
deficit
in
the
post
office
department.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
what,
what
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
we
feel
mr.
justice
that
there
actually
is
no
substantial
constitutional
issue
presented
by
the
mere
expenditure
of
money.
and
that
consequently,
it
is
proper
for
this
court
to
say
so,
at
this
time.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
our
position,
yes.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
i
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
that's
right.
we
--
we
shall
stipulate
it
and
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
some
has
been
so
used,
that
--
that's
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
think
we
are
saying
that,
yes.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
is
exactly
our
position.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no,
i
don't
think
it
could
mr.
justice
black.
i
do
think
that
if
some
unconstitutionality
of
the
expenditure
were
demonstrated,
the
relief
given
below
is
wrong.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
and
that
--
and
to
that
extent,
i
would
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
relief
has
been
misconceived.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
2,
eleventh,
yes.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well
i
--
in
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
--
in
my
view,
the
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well
it
did.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
it
did.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
(inaudible)
decline
to
do
so.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
--
i
think
that
that's
the
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
we
are
claiming
that
the
statute
does
permit
it.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right,
that's
right.
now,
we
have
--
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
in
response
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
beginning
at
page
2
of
that
brief.
we
have
shown
that
this
very
issue
as
to
the
nature
of
union
expenditures,
has
been
before
congress
at
least
three
times,
that
it
was
there
during
the
process
of
enactment
of
section
2,
eleventh.
it
was
there
earlier
and
it's
been
there
again
since.
in
fact,
it
arose
in
congress
by
reason
of
an
amendment
to
another
piece
of
legislation
that
was
introduced
by
senator
potter,
as
a
direct
consequence
to
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
contrary
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
this
very
case.
and
congress
has
had
at
least
three
occasions
to
consider
whether
it
should
enact
legislation
or
limit
the
authority
of
the
union-shop
agreements,
so
as
to
avoid
the
kind
of
expenditures
herein
complained
of,
or
to
permit
union
members
who
objected
to
the
nature
of
the
expenditures
to
retain
or
to
recover
or
retain
a
part
of
those
dues
and
congress
has
on
each
occasion,
rejected
any
such
approach.
i
bring
also
to
your
attention
a
portion
of
the
brief
amicus
filed
by
the
affl-cio,
beginning
at
page
14
of
that
brief,
which
contents
are
very
splendid,
historical
documentation
of
the
activities
of
rail
--
of
labor
unions
in
this
country.
it
shows
that
before
the
nation
was
even
founded,
before
we
had
a
constitution,
labor
unions
in
this
country
are
traditionally
always
engaged
in
activities
other
than
strictly
confined
to
the
negotiation
and
administration
of
rates
of
pay
in
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
it
has
always
been
necessary
for
them
in
order
to
protect
their
very
existence,
in
order
to
provide
conditions
under
which
they
can
function
effectively
to
engage
in
legislative
and
political
activities.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
--
that
is
correct.
now,
we
have
shown,
however,
and
have
quoted
from
this
court's
opinion
in
colgate-palmolive-peet
company
against
the
nlrb
338
u.s.
at
page
362,
recognition
by
this
court,
that
the
union-shop
and
the
closed
shop
also
are
traditional,
historic
instruments
of
collective
bargaining.
they,
no
less
than
the
activities
of
unions,
antedate
the
nation
itself.
now,
i
realized
mr.
justice
stewart
that
that
combination,
in
and
off
itself,
does
not
raise
the
issues
that
are
tendered
here,
but
that
the
combination,
plus
the
statute
is
what
gives
rise
to
the
issue.
but
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
in
the
application
and
interpretation
of
the
constitution,
you
can't
treat
the
constitution
itself
in
the
abstract
either,
what
has
been
traditional,
historic
function
of
labor
organizations
both
with
respect
to
the
activities
in
which
they
engage
and
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
agreements
that
they
make,
must
certainly
be
relevant
to
whether
the
first
amendment
rights
are
violated
when
congress
permits
a
union-shop
agreement
to
be
made
and
says,
"we
are
hereby
preempting
this
field
and
irrespective
of
state
law,
we
are
permitting
union-shop
agreements
to
be
made."
surely,
this
whole
course
of
history
antedating
the
nation
itself,
is
relevant
to
whether
that
permission
on
the
part
of
congress
and
the
negotiation
of
a
traditional
type
of
labor
agreement,
plus
engaging
in
the
activities
that
unions
have
engaged
in
for
centuries,
violates
any
first
amendment
rights.
