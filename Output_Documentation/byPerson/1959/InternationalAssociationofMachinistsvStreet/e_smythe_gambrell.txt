mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
several
named
workers
of
the
southern
railway
company,
who
in
turn
represent
several
hundred
or
thousand
members
of
a
class
of
employees.
i
have
no
connection
with
the
southern
railway
company
or
with
the
unions.
we
arrived
here
six
and
a
half
years
after
the
legislation
started
in
the
state
courts
of
georgia.
the
trial
judge
at
(inaudible)
as
has
been
said
first
dismissed
our
suit
against
the
railroad
and
the
unions
ought
a
general
(inaudible)
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
reversed
that
dismissal
when
it
discovered
that
fundamentals
rights
of
men
were
to
speak.
a
patient
in
pain
who
is
taking
trial
on
the
merits
came
five
and
a
half
years
after
our
suit
was
filed.
all
parties
agreed
that
the
judge
might
pass
on
the
law
and
the
facts,
without
a
jury.a
great
mass
of
evidence
was
introduced.
the
findings
and
the
decree
were
in
favor
of
my
clients.
on
the
appeal,
the
supreme
court
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
this
obviously,
is
a
case
of
great
moment
and
my
concern
has
been
and
is,
with
the
dignity
and
worth
of
the
individual.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
ask
for
an
injunction
to
stop
the
enforcement
of
section
2,
eleventh
allowing
this
union
shop
under
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
administered.
that
is,
with
rampant
politics
mixed
in
with
it.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
attacked
the
statute
and
we
sought
the
refund
of
the
money
which
we
had
paid
and
an
injunction
against
collecting
further
money.
we
asked
that
the
contract
the
union
and
agreement
be
declared
unconstitutional,
as
in
violation
has
administered
in
violation
of
the
bill
of
rights.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
your
honor,
there
is
the
contention
on
the
other
side
here
that
the
--
that
very
obviously,
this
act
contemplates
what
they
call
the
continuation
of
a
free
practice
of
politics
which
they
claim
in
their
briefs
they've
had
for
100
years.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
if
that
--
if
that
is
the
law,
if
that
is
what
congress
intended,
we
wish
to
have
the
act
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
--
well,
we
want
it
enjoined.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
want
the
enforcement
of
that
law
enjoined.
the
enforcement
of
the
contract
enjoined.
and
we
would
like
to
have
the
law,
as
administered,
declared
unconstitutional,
as
they
--
as
they're
using
it
as
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
it's
conceivable
that
some
other
treatment
might
be
given
it
but
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
that's
section
2,
eleventh,
not
the
--
not
the
entire
section
but
the
section
which
grants
an
exception
to
other
parts
of
section
2
which
would
prohibit
a
union
shop.
this
is
not
a
repeal.
this
is
merely
an
act
to
grant
an
exception
to
a
law
which
has
many
parts
and
many
ramifications.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
oh,
oh,
we
are
striking
to
get
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
it
might
be
implied
as
included.
we
have
not
talked
about
it
because
nobody
has
talked
on
that
subject
in
that
way.
the
opposition
has
preferred
to
talk
in
terms
of
the
whole
hog
and
nothing
as
one
might
say.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes.
we
think
that
if
--
if
there
has
become
a
concept
encrusted
upon
this
law
to
the
effect
that
--
that
full
and
free
lobbying
and
politicking
is
a
part
of
their
program
and
if
they
are
permitted
to
do
it,
we
are
meeting
them
head
on
because
we
are
sure
of
our
facts
and
we
are
sure
that
it
does
contravene
the
fundamental
rights.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
that
the
--
justice
stewart,
at
least
30
or
40
times
the
word
“substantial”
is
used.
there's
such
a
variation
that
we
couldn't
get
down
to
details
on
how
many
pennies.
now
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
that's
right.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
there
were
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
potential
parties
that
interest
in
the
case
and
we
had
to
try
the
basic
principles
and
we
tried
the
accounting
in
respect
to
those
present,
but
we
have
a
thing
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
that
would
create,
sir
a
--
an
intolerable
living
condition
for
the
men
in
this
industry.he
would
be
known
as
a
scab.
he
would
be
despised.
it
certainly
couldn't
promote
goodwill
between
working
men
and
industry
or
between
working
men
themselves.
i
would
like
to
move
on
as
quickly
as
possible
to
a
disclosure
of
the
facts.
there
seems
to
be
considerable
lack
of
information,
which
i'm
sorry,
the
other
side
has
not
given
regarding
the
facts
in
this
case.
and
i
want
to
move
immediately
to
page
153
of
the
record.
i
wish
i
had
time
to
go
in
detail,
but
you
will
see
that
they
have
26
depositions
taken,
31
additional
depositions
noticed
and
under
subpoena.
that's
on
page
157.
there
were
some
others
where
commissioners
were
appointed
and
that
depositions
were
about
to
be
taken
including
the
president
of
afl-cio,
that's
on
page
161.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
now,
someone
asked
who
are
the
people
who
get
this
help
politically?
and
opposing
counsel
very
quickly
said,
“they
are
not
named
here.
well,
some
are
named.”
but
i
would
invite
you
to
look
at
page
162,
which
says,
“whereas
the
union
defendants
have
suggested
to
the
plaintiffs
and
intervening
plaintiffs
that
most
of
the
material
facts
in
this
case
could
be
adduced
and
condensed
through
a
mutual
stipulation
in
writing.
and
the
plaintiffs
and
intervening
plaintiffs
have
agreed
thereto
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
court.
then
a
stipulation
is
written,
about
a
55-page
stipulation.
and
i'm
sure
that
the
other
side
will
not
question
the
fact
that
their
request
for
a
stipulation,
when
we
are
in
the
midst
of
taking
these
depositions
of
these
leading
people
here
in
this
city
and
in
other
cities
across
the
country.
the
idea
was,
on
their
part,
to
spare
the
beneficiaries
if
this
lodges,
the
embarrassment
of
having
their
names
paraded
in
an
open
deposition.
now,
i
want
to
move
on
rapidly
to
--
to
certain
parts
of
this
stipulation
which
are
factual
and
was
signed
by
all
the
lawyers
in
this
case
and
which
were
testified
to
by
leading
officials
as
being
correct.
this
is
the
most
amazing
labor
document
that
i
have
looked
at
in
my
entire
life
where
we
spent
three
months
hammering
it
out
around
the
table.
and
we
have
tried
to
avoid
here,
mentioning
the
names
of
people.
you'll
find
on
page
166
substantial
number
of
other
employees
similarly
situated.
paragraph
(6),
substantial
number
of
employees
of
the
railroad
defense
whose
employment
was
just
terminated
and
so
on,
that's
unquestionable.
that
plaintiffs
and
intervening
plaintiffs
fell
and
adequately
represent
the
purposes
of
this
litigation,
for
the
purposes
of
the
litigation,
the
interest
of
the
other
employees
and
so
on
in
detail.
8
and
9
refer
to
this
as
being
a
class
action.
they
laid
a
question
there.
but
i'm
coming
on
to
something
more
interesting
than
that.
we
go
on
to
page
171.
each
of
the
plaintiffs
and
intervening
plaintiffs
was
employed
for
many
years
by
one
of
the
defenders
and
so
on.
the
periodic
--
the
15,
the
periodic
dues
currently
required
to
maintain
this
organization
to
espouse.
and
you
will
find
there
on
pages
172
and
following,
a
list
of
fees,
initiation
fees,
reinstatement
fees,
going
on
through
175.
but
i
must
move
rapidly.
page
176
has
a
startling
statement,
paragraph
(19).
the
periodic
dues,
fees
and
assessments
which
plaintiffs,
intervening
plaintiffs
and
the
class
they
represent
have
been
or
and
will
be
required
to
pay
under
the
terms,
the
union-shop
agreement
here
and
above
referred
to,
have
been
or
being
and
will
be
used
in
substantial
part,
mr
justice
stewart,
for
purposes
other
than
the
negotiation,
maintenance
and
administrations
of
agreements
concerning
rates
of
pay,
rules
and
working
conditions
or
hours,
or
wages,
hours,
terms
and
other
conditions
of
employment,
or
the
handling
of
disputes
relative
to
the
above.
but
to
support
ideological
and
political
doctrines
and
candidates
which
plaintiffs
and
intervening
plaintiffs
and
the
class
they
represent
by
--
the
class
represented
by
them,
will,
are
and
will
be
opposed
to
and
they're
are
not
willing
to
support.
paragraph
(20)
describes
the
mechanism
and
how
the
money
goes
through
and
that's
undisputed.
paragraph
(22)
goes
on
into
detail
about
the
mechanism.
paragraph
(24)
then
(25)
refers
to
the
railway
labor
executives
association,
and
talks
about
that
organization
and
that
man
named
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
ctn
is
the
man
whose
deposition
we
were
about
to
take
when
they
decided
they
wanted
this
stipulation
instead
of
the
deposition.
page
180,
paragraph
(27),
the
activities
of
the
railway
labor
executives'
association
have
been
on
and
will
be
financed
through
assessments
levied
upon
the
above
mentioned
organizations
and
so
forth.
and
you
see
the
money
involved
there.
and
you
go
on,
on
page
182
to
the
railway
labor's
political
league
and
you
see
the
money
on
subsequent
pages
involved
in
that.
and
then
we
see
a
reference
now
and
then
to
a
so-called
free
funds,
which
they
claimed
was
not
useful
but
was
what
you
might
call
voluntary
contributions
in
addition
to
this
sort
of
thing,
which
that
these
agencies
handled
or
salaried
as
they
are
by
the
money
that
my
clients
pay.
paragraph
or
page
186
is
a
very
interesting
page.
the
class
represented
by
plaintiffs
and
intervening
plaintiffs
includes
members
of
both
major
political
parties.
the
1956
railway
labor
political
league
contribute
--
in
1956,
contributed
substantial
financial
support
to
the
national
committee
of
one
major
national
party,
political
party
and
locked
to
the
other.
in
1954,
the
same
thing,
in
1956,
to
eight
u.s.
senatorial
candidates
of
one
party
and
none
of
the
other,
in
1954,
to
13
candidates
of
one
party
and
none
of
the
other,
there's
a
stipulation
further
down
that
says
it
always
was
the
same
party
and
the
same
posture.
in
other
words,
they
didn't
alternate.
it
was
always
on
the
same
pattern.
in
1956
to
64
congressmen
of
one
party,
congressional
candidates
and
four
of
the
other.
in
1954,
to
56
congressional
candidates
and
six
of
the
other
--
other
party
and
three
gubernatorial
candidates
against
none
for
the
other
party,
i
wish
time
permitted
us
to
go
into
that.
i
--
i
do
want
to
speak
out
of
turn
when
i
urge
you
to
read
this
as
something
that
will
give
you
a
complete
grasp
of
the
horrible
situation
in
which
my
clients
find
themselves.
it
happens
here
that
the
--
the
swing
seems
to
be
in
favor
of
the
party
that
i
was
born
and
raised
then
in
south
carolina.
it
doesn't
matter
which
party
it
belongs
to.
i
see
that
if
they're
republicans
in
organized
labor,
who
are
qualified
otherwise
to
do
their
work,
they
should
not
be
outlawed
and
they
should
not
be
blackjacked
into
giving
contributions
to
my
party
or
to
any
other
party,
but
they
should
be
able
to
stand
up
like
free
men.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
no,
sir.
i
--
i
think
--
i'd
like
to
go
on
with
the
rest
of
this
and
i
think
i
haven't
time.
i
think
i've
given
the
--
the
court
enough
that
they're
going
to
read
on
in
this
because
there's
a
lot
of
the
same
thing
here.
i
want
now
--
now
to
go
to
the
hanson
case
because
you're
entitled
to
something
more
than
you've
had
about
the
hanson
case
and
i
want
to
give
it
to
you.
the
hanson
case
was
decided
in
1956.
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
these
gentlemen
here
tried,
as
they
tried
most
of
the
cases
that
are
closely
related
to
this
subject
here.
they
are
experts,
full
time
experts.
i
--
i
went
around
the
other
day
to
dig
up
the
record
in
the
hanson
case
and
i
have
it
here.
and
i
dug
up
the
--
the
transcripts
of
the
argument
right
here
in
1956.
i
found
the
lawyer,
mr.
edson
smith
in
omaha
who
--
who
happened
to
have
it,
and
i'm
going
to
refer
to
some
things
that
were
said
in
the
trial
of
that
case.
i
want
to
tell
you
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
there's
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
hanson
case,
evidence
of
use
of
political
funds
compelled
from
unwilling
laborers.
not
one
iota,
in
that
case.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
--
i'll
go
on.
i
think
i
can
clear,
your
honor,
on
that.
this
case
was
tried
like
justice
frankfurter
and
i
used
to
try
some
factitious
cases
in
harvard
law
school.
we
just
sat
up
there
and
--
this
case
was
tried
on
supposition.
i'm
--
i'm
looking
at
the
transcript
now
by
an
official
court
reporter,
page
19.
here
is
the
argument
by
mr.
smith
who
was
standing
in
my
place
here.
i
--
i
didn't
know
it.
now,
in
order
to
make
the
case
clear,
i
think
it's
necessary
to
go
into
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
and
get
some
of
the
facts.
the
only
place
they
got
the
facts
within
legislative
history.
this
statute,
he
says
on
page
25,
affirmatively
authorized
a
union-shop
contract
compelling
people
to
become
members
--
a
labor
union
of
a
--
of
an
association
or
a
union
they
--
that
they
have
to
join.
that
was
made
clear
by
the
legislative
history.
now,
that's
the
proof
they
had
in
this
case,
just
a
few
documents
of
legislative
history,
a
few
copies
of
charters
and
bylaws
but
more
of
the
accounting
such
as
we've
given
here
about
money
extracted.
that
case
was
tried
prospectively.
that
case
was
tried
in
the
beginning
before
anybody
had
gotten
hurt
by
the
act
and
it
was
tried
suppositiously.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
think
it
gets
mentioned.
i
think
it
gets
mentioned
in
the
nebraska
decision.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
think
the
nebraska
court
just
accepted
this
supposititious
talk
and
later
on
and
gave
a
decision
without
any
evidentiary
record.
this
is
typical.
he
says,
“this
is
mr.
smith
representing
the
independence.”
he
said
in
one
of
the
letters
which
didn't
get
before
congress
because
the
congressman
had
no
time
to
put
it
in,
but
he
put
it
in
the
record
by
extending
his
remarks
in
a
letter
from
a
railway
telegraph.
he
said
he
quit
the
union
because
he
found
that
most
of
his
dues,
$28
a
year
was
being
spent
by
the
union
to
oppose
such
men
as
honorable
robert
a.
taft
and
he
didn't
like
that.
now,
this
piece
was
tried
on
gossip,
good-natured
friendly
gossip,
but
no
evidence
at
all,
tried
it
on
the
--
on
legislative
reports
and
things
of
that
sort.
it
says
here,
annexed,
mr.
smith
on
page
31
speaks
of
an
excerpt
from
the
senatorial
committee
reporting
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i'm
reading
mr.
smith's
argument
in
which
he
bases
his
argument
here
before
this
court.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
hanson
case.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
someone
wanted
to
know
how
this
--
how
the
hanson
decision
came
up.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
would
say
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
would
say
this,
that
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
accepted
a
supposititious
situation
and
acted
upon
it.
and
it
would
--
it
came
here,
apparently
this
court
looked
at
it
and
decided
that
it
wouldn't
go
on
supposititious
rectitude.
and
this
court's
rule,
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
“the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
said
such
action
on
the
part
of
congress
is
a
necessary
part
of
every
union-shop
contract
entered
into
on
the
railroads
as
far
as
these
17
states
are
concerned.
we
will
agree
with
that
view.
if
private
rights
are
being
invaded,
it
is
by
force
of
the
agreement
and
so
forth.”
he
proceeds
and
says
that
on
the
basis
of
the
present
record,
he
cannot
find
any
basis
for
constitutional
attack,
and
i
can't
either.
there
wasn't
any
evidence
there
on
which
to
base
the
constitutional
attack
in
that
case.
so,
he
looked
through
what
the
nebraska
supreme
court
didn't
look
through
and
he
saw
he
had
nothing
but
a
stack
of
--
of
papers
that
were
not
evidence.
he
says
that
he
he's
argued
that
compulsory
membership
would
be
used
to
impair
freedom
of
expression.“but
that
problem
is
not
presented
by
this
record,”
he
said.
congress
endeavored
to
safeguard
against
that
possibility
by
making
explicit
that
no
conditions
to
membership
may
be
imposed
except
as
respects
periodic
dues,
initiation
fees,
and
assessments.
if
other
conditions
are
in
fact
imposed
or
if
the
exaction
of
dues,
initiation
fees
or
assessments
is
used
as
a
cover
for
forcing
ideological
conformity
or
other
action
in
contravention
of
the
first
amendment,
this
judgment
will
not
prejudice
the
decision
in
that
case.
today,
we
have
brought
that
case
here
which
the
court
in
the
hanson
case
reserved
judgment
upon.
we
have
here
in
facts,
“too
full
to
handle,”
all
the
evidence
that
you
could
possibly
read
in
the
next
two
or
three
months
on
that
subject
if
you
were
disposed
to
do
it.
if
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
“for
we
pass
narrowly
on
section
2,
eleventh
of
the
railway
labor
act.”
we
only
hold
that
the
requirement
for
financial
support
of
the
collective
bargaining
agency
by
all
who
receive
the
benefits
of
his
work
is
within
the
power
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause
and
does
not
violate
either
the
first
or
fifth
amendment.
we
are
not
here
contesting
the
hanson
decision
of
this
court.
i
--
i
think
there
might
be
some
who
would
say
that
that
goes
quite
far,
to
say
that
an
individual
with
the
dignity
which
attaches
to
the
individual,
who
should
have
to
give
up
his
right
to
conduct
his
own
negotiations,”
which
he
does
under
the
hanson
decision
as
far
as
his
economic
arrangements
with
the
company
goes,
he
must
give
up
willingly
or
unwillingly,
he
gives
that
up.
we
are
not
questioning
that.
we've
never
questioned
that.
what
we
say
is,
that
the
hanson
case
goes
not
beyond
collective
bargaining,
as
it
plainly
says
on
its,
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
limited
his
concurrence
in
the
same
language.
we
say
that
when
they
go
beyond
that
and
they
have
many
paragraphs
in
that
stipulation
which
i
was
reading
to
you,
which
say
plainly
that
they
do
go
beyond
that.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
that's
right.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
limit
--
injunction
against
the
--
the
use
of
2,
eleventh
as
it's
being
used
now.
the
court
said
if
they
withdrew
from
the
abuses,
then
the
court
would
reconsider
the
order.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
the
court
didn't
have
the
facts
before
it
in
that
case.
and
on
the
facts
it
had,
it
had
to
render
the
decision
or
at
least
it
--
if
they
were
justified
in
rendering
the
decision
it
did
because
there
was
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
of
political
use
in
the
hanson
record,
not
a
scintilla
of
positive
evidence.
now,
the
court
hears
from
these
gentlemen
that
their
regular
way
to
do
business
is
in
politics
that
when
they
undertake
to
conduct
economic
negotiations
as
a
collective
bargaining
representative,
they,
at
the
same,
claim
other
prerogatives
and
that
the
majority,
can
you
say,
the
political
rights
of
the
minority
in
supporting
candidates
and
in
supporting
legislative
measure.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
we've
sought
an
injunction
and
we've
--
we've
sought
an
injunction
and
we've
sought
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
as
the
act
is
now
enforced.
it's
all
inclusive.
we
want
whatever
seems
to
prove
it.
we
sought
an
injunction
because
it's
unconstitutionally
applied
to
us.
we
sought
in
addition
to
an
injunction,
a
declaration,
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
law
--
that
the
contract
is
illegal
as
enforced,
and
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional
as
it
seems.
we
had
several
prayers.
we
want
whatever
is
right
to
get
justice
for
these
working
people.
i
was
interested
in
the
brief
which
was
filed
amicus
curiae
by
the
afl-cio
in
this
case.
they
seem
to
take
the
bold
position
that
politics
is
the
main
business
of
unionism
and
that
it
must
continue
to
be.
we
take
the
position
that
the
rights
about
saved
by
the
first
amendment
and
the
other
amendments
of
the
bill
of
rights
are
absolute
rights.
we
further
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
agonizing
alternative
confronting
this
court.
sometimes,
i
know
two
great
principles
compete
with
each
other
for
recognition.
we
don't
have
that
situation
here.
we
are
not
here
fighting
in
any
way
trade
unionism.
we're
haven't
the
slightest
quarrel
to
make
with
the
institution
of
trade
unionism
which
certainly
has
been
accepted
as
a
part
of
the
american
life.
we
do
say
that,
in
this
particular,
trade
unionism
needs
some
advice
to
protect
it
against
its
own
folly.
if
this
practice
which
they
so
boldly
admit,
is
sanctioned
here,
it
would
mean
that
there
would
be
no
end
to
where
certain
losses
might
lead
labor
unions
of
divided
settlement
as
i
mentioned
a
while
ago.
the
evidence
is
undisputed
here
that
they
have
no
referendum
that
the
decisions
on
candidates,
the
decisions
on
measures,
on
me,
by
the
individuals
and
the
committees
at
the
time.
afl-cio
says
an
adverse
decision
might
in
effect
compel
all
these
unions
either
to
give
up
the
union-shop
or
to
abandon
their
tradition
on
ascension
activities
in
the
political
and
legislative
views.
i
see
no
reason
for
that.
they
have
asked
the
government
and
over
a
period
of
years,
the
government
has
made
them
trustees
of
government
policy.
the
government
through
a
complex
of
numerous
laws
including
the
railway
labor
act
had
designated
these
unions
as
instruments
of
government
policy,
have
given
them
a
governmental
dignity,
have
made
them
trustees
of
certain
rights
and
obligation
not
only
to
themselves
but
to
society
at
large.
if
they
desired
to
at
making
this
contract,
to
become
that
trustee,
we
ask
them
to
discharge
their
obligations
under
the
trust
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
the
bill
of
rights.
we
are
not
trying
to
interfere
with
any
voluntary
associations
whether
they
would
be
bar
associations
or
labor
organizations.
somewhere
in
here,
the
afl-cio
makes
a
remark
like
this.
they
say,
“yes,
the
government
helped
us,
the
government
forces
you
to
come
in
and
join
and
pay
us
this
money,
but
we
are
a
private
officer.
there's
no
law.
there's
no
executive.
there's
no
anybody
who
can
tell
us
what
we
do
with
this
money
when
we
get
it.
that's
stated
in
here
two
or
three
times
and
i
won't
have
the
time
to
find
it.
now
i
say
that's
a
dangerous
state
of
mind
to
be
in
for
the
salvation
of
labor
itself,
the
constitution
ought
to
be
brought
in
here.
when
--
when
an
agency
accepts
a
governmental
status,
it
accepts
the
inhibitions
of
the
constitution.
here
are
some
words
that
interested
me
in
the
afl-cio
document
page
12.
as
was
said
by
a
political
philosopher
whose
credentials
antedate
date
even
those
of
this
court,
“a
state
arises
out
of
the
needs
of
mankind.”
now,
he
goes
on
and
says,
“to
determine
the
proper
objects
of
this
“labor
state”
or
specialized
government
instrumentality
which
we
are
now
assuming
a
union
is
and
to
determine
what
they
reasonably
be
selected
to
attain
these
objects,
one
must
look
to
the
needs
of
the
labor
in
there.”
i
want
to
say
here
that
this
court
has
never
been
quick
to
whittle
away
the
fundamental
rights
in
the
first
amendment
for
every
passing
breeze.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
it
is
not
easy
to
do.
it
may
be
that
the
--
a
decree
or
a
judgment
would
have
to
outline
in
principle
what
it
would
be
and
then
leave
for
specific
litigation
from
time
to
time.
they
admit
that
they
had
gone
further
than
what
germane.
they
--
they
spent
money
here
for
the
development
they've
held
as
opinion.
i
mean
they
recommend
it.
they
--
the
have
a
big
interest
expressed
and
they
support
in
foreign
aid.
they
--
they
deal
with
many
subjects
completely
apart.
now,
i
say
regardless
of
whether
one
is
a
democrat
or
republican
or
a
communist,
he
shouldn't
be
bound
by
the
capricious
selection
through
half
a
dozen
top
men
in
these
organizations
of
certain
things
which
this
man
has
got
to
support.
somebody
says,
“well,
maybe
he
can
take
his
money
and
go
out
and
do
the
way
he
wants
to
within
outside
just
so
long
he
pays
this.”
maybe
the
average
working
man
can't
afford
but
$60
a
year.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
so
long
as
the
--
as
it
relates
to
the
negotiation
between
the
employee
and
the
employer.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
specific
bargaining
in
relation
to
wages,
hours,
working
conditions,
and
things
of
that
nature.
somewhere
in
here
there's
a
statement
--
here
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
25.
this
is
an
arrogant
document,
this
is
an
afl-cio.
it
says,
“labor
generally
had
--
at
least
they're
giving
the
history
and
expressing
impatience
with
anybody
who
questions
their
full
political
rights
to
operate
through
a
government
instrumentality.
“labor
generally
had
found
unsatisfactory
the
record
of
the
eisenhower
administration
on
unemployment,
taxes,
housing,
federal
aid
to
education,
and
physical
and
monetary
measures.
redress
once
again
was
sought
and
proposed.”
now,
i
don't
know
just
what
the
bright
line
is,
but
i
would
say
that
there's
much
in
that
statement
that
has
no
relationship
to
the
collective
bargaining
which
mr.
justice
douglas
spoke
of
in
his
decision
and
to
the
collective
bargaining
which
was
contemplated
under
the
act.
we
take
no
sides
in
party
matters.
we
are
interested
in
constitutional
law.
we
are
interested
in
protecting
the
rights
of
our
client
and
those
they
represent
here.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
represent
several
people
by
name.
and
there
is
a
stipulation
here
in
the
record
which
says
that
they
represent
a
class
similarly
situated.
that's
a
stipulation
that
there's
quite
a
division
between
republicans
and
democrats
for
instance
in
the
constituency
of
that
--
of
the
employees.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
speak
for
those
who
are
like-minded
so
that
when
this
is
over,
this
issue
would
not
have
to
tried
by
every
poor
laborer
who
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
--
might
not
believe.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
if
the
law
is
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
if
the
law
has
setup
and
--
and
improperly
administered
or
improperly
conceived,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
it
--
it
should
be
stricken
regardless
of
whom
it
affects.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
don't
believe
that
it's
consistent
with
sound
constitutional
law,
that
protection
of
the
fundamental
rights
to
indulge
an
unconstitutional
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
--
practice.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i'm
speaking
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i'm
speaking
for
the
great
number
who
also
object.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
are
seeking
several
things,
your
honor.
one
was
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
over
there
since
it's
personally
being
enforced
there.
another
was
to
have
it
declared
unconstitutional
here.
and
we
also
are
seeking
--
we're
representing
those
who
are
similarly
situated
in
opposition
to
the
law.
and
we
couldn't
name
them
all.
they
are
too
many
to
name.
we
got
--
we
got
a
decree
for
a
refund
of
the
dues
which
our
own
immediate
clients,
name
clients
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
--
that
paid.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
it's
in
this
case.
yes,
sir,
for
a
refund.
that's
right.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i'll
have
to
find
it.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
possibly
so.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
101.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
101.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
if
they
don't,
i
suppose
that
--
that's
something
for
them
to
decide.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
if
your
honor,
please.
i
don't
believe
that
the
test
of
constitutionality
that
the
object
it'd
test
would
--
would
depend
on
the--
what
--
whether
everyone
objects
to
it
or
not.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
think
your
honor,
please,
that
there
is
such
a
solicitude
in
this
country
for
constitutional
law
that
not
one
citizen
of
this
country
should
be
sacrificed
even
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
--
though
others
are
not
complaining.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
all
i
can
say
is
that
--
that
we
are
fighting
for
the
principles
of
freedom.
and
we
have
to
make
our
case
on
the
people
who
are
in
here,
and
we
cannot
curtail
their
rights
because
we
may
not
know
what
some
other
people
want
to
do
with
their
freedom.
some
people
would
like
to
have
the
comfort
of
the
yoke.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
--
my
clients
don't
want
the
yoke.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
it
seems
to
me
it
would
only
multiply
litigation,
your
honor,
and
that's
not
one
of
the
purposes
this
act
which
ensued.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
no,
sir.
an
inquiry
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
no
integrated
bar
practices
politics
at
its
action.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
you
have
just
lots
of
bar
associations
who
practice
it
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
--
but
--
and
if
an
integrated
bar
does
practice
politics,
it
--
it
ought
to
be
brought
right
here.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
then
there's
the
bar
association,
that's
not
an
integrated
bar.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
it
is
not
a
government
option
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
no,
sir.
they
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
state
bars
usually
have
two
organizations.
one
is
a
volunteer
that
practices
the
politics.
mr.
justice
black's
home
state
i
think
was
the
first
one.
and
that
they
do
not
practice
politics.
i
think
they've
had
this
integrated
bar
now
for
38
years.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
as
long
as
it's
not
or
an
association,
it
doesn't
matter.
we're
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
--
not
attacking
that
at
all.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
are
not
attacking
voluntary
arrangements
in
labor
or
in
the
bar.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
no,
sir.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
that's
right.
in
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
in
very
narrow
limits,
they
concern
themselves
with
the
administration
of
justice,
the
improvement
of
the
law
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
and
they
are
an
arm
of
the
court
and
they
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
and
before
him
is
a
member
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
--
is
an
officer
of
the
court
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
--
and
--
and
that
virtually
every
instance
that
i'm
going
to
think
about,
the
court
has
immediate
supervision
over
integrated
bars
that
it
has
to
go
over
bar
association.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
they
can
tell
them
when
they
get
off
the
track
and
they
do,
your
honor.
and
you'll
find
in
that
case
and
numerous
places,
wisconsin
and
the
other
places.
they
have
thought
that
probably
the
illusion
here
on
that.
but
if
they're
misleading
things,
the
cases
they
signed
up
mostly
on
many
of
them
are
city
bar
associations
and
the
others
are
voluntary
associations
completely
beside
the
point
here.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
they
don't
--
they
--
they
don't
wander
us
apart
as
the
people
here
in
the
--
in
the
building.
i
would
like
--
i
would
to
answer
that
next
monday
if
your
honor
will
allow
me.
i
think
i
have
a
little
time
left,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well
the
other
--
i
see.
well
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
no,
i
know
but
i
didn't
know
my
time
was
out,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes.
well
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
about
the
integrated
bar,
your
honor.
we've
covered
it
in
our
brief.
it's
on
the
long
brief
and
i
apologize,
we
wanted
to
make
it
a
short
one
but
unable
to
do
it.
i
had
intended
to
talk
about
the
extent
of
the
money
paid
if
you'll
--
if
you'll
read
that
--
that
at
the
--
of
the
stipulation
and
the
depositions,
you'll
see
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
that
have
gone
here
completely
without
regard
to
the
feelings
of
the
people
who
put
the
money
in.
you'll
find
that
great
deal
of
comment
about
governmental
action.
you'll
find
a
great
deal
of
comment
about
the
question
of
germane
or
what's
germane
and
what
isn't.
we
--
we've
traced
in
greatest
detail
the
mechanism
through
which
this
money
comes
from
the
individuals
up
to
these
projects.
we
described
the
newspapers,
a
great
mass
of
papers.
every
union
has
a
paper
and
every
union
espouses,
expect
subjects.
about
half
of
them
are
labor
subjects.
about
half
of
them
are
held
as
opinion
or
foreign
aid
or
something
else.
now
somebody
says
“why,
why
can't
this
man
just
ignore
that?”
i
say
when
--
when
people
stock
their
coverage
on
the
compulsion
paying
ten
cents
a
week
or
$2.00
a
year
for
that
magazine,
stock
their
coverage
with
bad
literature,
they
are
going
to
eat
some
of
that
literature.
furthermore,
they
are
spending
their
money
under
compulsion
for
that
when
--
that's
perhaps
all
they
can
spend
for
politics
and
how
they're
going
to
have
to
enter
to
spend
for
the
objects
that
they
are
really
interested
in.
i
wanted
to
talk
about
the
various
freedoms.
freedom
of
political
belief
and
association
under
the
first
amendment,
freedom
of
speech
and
the
press,
the
compulsion
of
ideological
conformity
through
this
welder
of
literature.
i
have
here
a
list
of
the
--
the
obligations
which
a
member
must
commit
himself
to,
in
joining
these
various
organizations.
they
are
all
in
booklet
form
in
the
record,
not
in
the
book
but
in
the
record
which
weighs
200
to
300
pounds
in
which
it
took
a
truck
to
bring
it
up
here
from
georgia.
you
will
find
in
almost
every
case
a
solemn
undertaking
to
subscribe
to
and
comply
with
all
the
principles
and
programs
of
each
one.
now
someone
may
say,
"well
you
don't
have
to
do
that
seriously
you
can
swear
to
all
of
that
and
then
we'll
often
do
what
please.”
i
say,
if
that
is
the
approach
that
one
would
say,
then
in
the
jehovah's
witness
cases,
you
can
let
the
little
boy
salute
the
flag
and
then
go
on
and
follow
his
jehovah's
witness
principles
outside.
i
think
paying
money
and
taking
an
oath
and
assuming
membership
is
more
than
solemn
ceremony,
than
saluting
a
flag,
that's
my
feeling.
i
think
that
this
court
on
many
occasions
has
said
that
the
rights
under
the
first
amendment,
hence,
many
of
the
other
amendments
are
absolute
because
there
are
--
there
are
those
who
say
as
my
friends,
“you
see,
give
them
a
little
attitude.”
some
say
that
if
my
clients
are
allowed
their
freedom,
they
might
be
apostles
of
unrest..
they
might
be
not
good
friends
of
the
labor
union
just
as
people
who
can
speak
their
voice
on
the
streets
that
might
not
be
good
friends
of
this
country.
but
i
would
say
that
more
in
point
about
the
freedom
of
speech
is
that
it
is
the
deadly
enemy
of
everyone
who
hates
this
country.
it's
a
deadly
enemy
of
tyrants.
what
we
seek
is
that
every
worker
and
i
understand
they
are
about
16
million
of
them
shall
have
the
right
to
stand
up
and
practice
politics
as
our
progenitors
came
over
here
for
the
right
to
do.
to
have
not
only
free
religion
and
i
might
say
then
just
a
word,
the
statute
of
virginia
for
religious
freedom
was
formulated
by
james
madison
and
passed
in
1785.
it
was
the
progenitor
of
the
first
amendment.
and
i
think
we
are
all
familiar
with
that
language.
i
say
that
it
is
possible
in
this
case
to
stand
up
as
this
court
has
stood
up
on
many
occasions
in
recent
years
and
in
times
further
past,
for
the
oppressed
individual.
it's
possible
to
stand
up
for
the
oppressed
individual
here.
many
cases
come
from
my
part
of
the
southland
here,
and
this
court
has
heard
the
cry.
i'm
bringing
here
six
people
who
represent
or
stand
in
the
place
of
many
others
who
ask
that
their
rights
under
the
first
amendment
remain
unimpaired.
that
whatever
declarations
by
this
court
whether
unnecessary
be
made,
and
that
it
will
be
made
clear
to
organize
labor
which
serves
a
great
function
in
this
country.
that
if
they
want
to
practice
politics,
they
should
go
outside
of
the
government
to
do
it.
certainly
the
government
has
even
gone
so
far
as
to
see
that
an
exemption
to
a
man
who
would
sign
a
non-communist
oath
is
an
unfair
advantage
compelling
him
to
say
something
that
he
might
not
otherwise
want
to
say
but
when
he
wanted
to
remain
silent.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
is
your
honor
speaking
of
the
hanson
case?
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
oh,
the
georgia
decision.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
have
seen
this
court
in
the
thompson
case
from
kentucky
and
now,
the
case
does
not
hesitate
to
take
a
practical
stand
to
get
a
practical
result.
whatever
is
needed
here
to
protect
my
clients
is
what
we
want.
we
--
we
had
a
broad
prayer
and
we
had
a
relief
granted
in
several
paragraphs,
one
of
which
was
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
--
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
this
contract
against
my
client.
another
was
to
give
my
clients
back
the
money.
another
was
for
declaratory
judgement
saying
that
the
contract
is
illegal.
and
another
was
to
declare
the
act
itself
unconstitutional.
we
want
whatever
we
can
get
your
honor,
on
the
--
in
this
case.
it's
taken
us
six
and
a
half
years
to
bring
it
here.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well
we
think
it's
unconstitutional.
they
say
that
historically
that's
what
it
is
and
that
the
act
has
with
it,
this
type
of
application,
this
type
administration.
if
that's
a
part
of
the
act,
then
the
act
would
have
to
be
unconstitutional.
your
honor,
please,
i
want
to
stress
the
fact
that
the
words
of
statute
appears
in
many,
many
instances.
some
question
was
raised
about
the
amount
of
these
dues
and
well
this
was
a
big
lawsuit
about
a
--
a
few
dollars.
they
have
alleged
at
--
in
the
record
at
page
37
that
each
of
these
parties
has
an
interest
exceeding
$3000
in
order
to
get
a
removal
to
the
federal
court
when
they
filed
a
petition
for
removal.
they
have
stipulated
that
this
is
a
case
for
class
action.
they
did
not
demur
to
our
bringing
it
as
a
class
action.
we
say
they
--
there
is
no
reason
why
it
shouldn't
be
a
class
action
as
we
have
brought
it.we
come
back
to
the
original
proposition,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
the
petition
for
removal
to
the
federal
court
by
the
other
side
alleged
that
each
of
the
plaintiffs,
my
clients,
had
an
interest
in
excess
of
$3000.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
it
went
--
the
--
the
case
was
removed
and
then
was
remanded
by
consent
later.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes,
sir.
by
all
parties.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
upon
themselves
that's
right.
your
honor
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
say
it
would
be
much
more
than
that.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
they
have
been
working
anywhere
from
20
to
40
years
there.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
under
--
well,
under
whatever
agreement
they
had
to
be
there.
some
of
them
have
refused
to
join
and
they
put
a
bond
up
so
they
had
to
join
and
paid.
i
think
the
decisions
are
clear
that
--
that
one
who
is
wronged
however
humbled
doesn't
have
to
put
up
a
bond
even
a
small
bond
in
order
to
get
constitutional
rights.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
the
lawyers
opposing
so
alleged
in
removing
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
--
the
case.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
would
think
that
a
right,
a
lifetime
right
in
a
job
and
a
right
that
comes
to
men
from
the
first
amendment
is
worth
a
lot
more
than
$3000,
that's
--
that's
my
view.
and
when
they
tell
him,
as
they
have
given
him
the
hard
choice
here,
either
you
do
this,
or
give
up
your
job.
he
has
an
impossible
alternative.
we
hope
that
this
court
as
it
has
so
often,
will
hear
the
cry
of
these
people
and
will
find
a
way
to
give
them
the
relief
from
the
intolerable
situation
in
which
they
find
themselves.
the
government
can't
tax
a
man
for
the
benefit
of
another.
they've
taken
this
money
without
due
process
of
law
under
the
fifth
amendment.
and
it
makes
it
all
the
more
heinous
when
they
tax
him
and
take
his
money
away
from
him
and
spend
it
in
support
of
the
candidate
that
he
despises
which
is
what
is
happening
here.
we
--
we
ask
your
honors,
to
fashion
your
decision
in
whatever
way
your
honors
would
conceive
that
constitutional
rights
could
be
protected
and
respected
here.
as
i
say
in
the
thompson
case
where
there
was
not
much
of
a
record
what
this
court
saw,
a
man
who
needed
something
and
they
didn't
have
any
trouble
in
writing
a
judgement
that
protected
it.
is
my
time
up
now,
your
honor?
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
(inaudible)
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suppose
my
presentation
must
be
all
in
one
part
and
i
will
proceed
on
that
basis.
i
wish
not
to
repeat
myself
nor
unnecessarily
to
repeat
or
discuss
what
is
not
contested
by
the
other
side.
i
represent
here
six
employees
of
the
southern
railway
system
who
filed
a
complaint
in
june
1953
against
the
southern
railway
and
15
unions
which
were
and
are
the
collective
bargaining
representatives
in
that
railroad.
the
complaint
shows
that
a
contract,
a
union
contract,
under
2,
eleventh
was
executed
in
february
1953
effective
in
april
1953.
the
complaint
and
the
facts
show
without
dispute
that
the
railroad
and
the
unions
immediately
notified
my
clients
and
the
class
that
they
undertake
to
speak
for
it.
that
unless,
they
join
the
union
or
had
in
good
standing
within
60
days
from
the
date
of
the
written
notice
that
they
would
be
summarily
discharged
from
their
jobs
in
the
southern
railroad.
the
evidence
shows
that
most
of
my
clients
have
been
long
with
the
southern
over
period
perhaps
of
15
to
25
years.
the
records
as
it
has
been
stated
show
that
three
of
these
six
joined
or
maintained
their
membership
and
three
refused
and
had
to
give
bond
in
this
case
to
keep
their
jobs,
give
a
bond
in
connection
with
the
lawsuit.
the
amended
complaint
and
the
evidence
without
dispute
shows
that
substantial
part
of
the
fees,
dues,
and
assessments
exacted
had
been
spent
for
purposes
not
germane
to
collective
bargaining.
i
might
say
that
this
is
the
largest
record
as
my
adversary
state
in
their
brief
and
that
was
ever
put
together
in
the
--
in
the
courts
of
georgia.
it
was
amassed
over
a
period
of
some
five
or
six
years
in
the
trial.
it
had
to
be
gleamed
from
places
at
great
distance
from
georgia
because
not
a
single
one
of
the
unions
had
its
quarters
in
georgia
or
its
records
there.
it
shows
that
the
money
was
used
to
promote
candidates
whom
my
clients
opposed
and
to
promote
measures
of
my
clients
approves.
those
points
are
at
the
heart
of
what
we
are
quarrelling
about
in
this
case.
there
was
evidence
and
this
evidence
beyond
dispute
that
much
of
the
money
in
effort
of
these
unions
was
devoted
to
foreign
aide,
national
security,
taxation,
education
and
1001
things
like
tva.
we
haven't
said
much
about
those
other
things
except
they
are
important
to
illustrate
the
character
of
this
entire
enterprise.
stated
simply,
the
plaintiffs
contend
and
show
that
the
unions
haven't
limited
themselves
to
collective
bargaining.
but
they
have
used
the
power
which
was
given
there
under
2,
eleventh
and
the
contract
and
various
other
laws
which
formed
the
complex
of
federal
regulatory
policy.
they
have
used
their
power
as
a
club
of
authority
under
which
they
have
demanded
an
exacted
money
and
membership
from
my
clients
and
the
class
of
which
they
are
a
part.
something
was
said
about
the
membership.
i
have
--
we
had
over
a
thousand
pages
of
transcripts
and
some
of
those
pages
were
themselves
books
or
large
reports
so
it
might
amount
to
10
or
15,000
real
pages
as
a
specimen
of
what
the
charters
in
bylaws
of
these
organizations
contained
and
my
brother
kramer
said
that
there
was
no
question
about
ultra
vires
and
we
are
not
making
the
point
of
ultra
vires
here,
we
don't
have
to
make
the
point.
we
would
be
digressing
to
go
to
ultra
vires
here.
and
we
don't
have
to
make
the
point
about
the
hatch
act,
because
our
complaint
is
unrelated
to
the
criminal
law.
but
as
an
example
of
what
it
is
that
we
are
required
to
join,
i
take
for
instance
international
association
of
machinists,
their
charges
in
there.
they
say
that
among
other
things,
the
policy
and
purpose
of
the
machinist
union
is
to
urge
the
membership
to
vote
only
for
and
support
candidates
who
are
in
favor
of
the
platform
which
shall
include
many
things
mentioned.
one
of
them
is
referendum
and
recall.
national
and
federal
income
tax
amount,
national
and
federal
inheritance
tax
law,
a
national
presidential
and
vice-presidential
primary
law,
the
election
of
president
and
vice-president
of
the
united
states
by
a
direct
popular
vote,
the
election
of
all
judges
without
exception
by
a
popular
vote
of
the
people,
public
ownership
of
utilities.
the
platform
also
says
that
no
in
theory
of
federal
judge
shall
set
aside
the
law
of
congress.
and
that
if
the
supreme
court
assumes
to
set
aside
a
law
of
congress
by
any
interpretation
as
undertakes
to
a
certain
public
policy
at
variance
with
the
dec
--
statutory
declaration
of
congress
which
alone,
under
our
system,
is
authorized
to
determine
the
public
policies
of
government.
the
congress
may,
by
at
the
repassing
the
law,
nullify
the
action
of
the
court,
thereafter
the
law
to
remain
in
full
force
and
effect.
i
could
go
on
but
it's
not
necessary.
it
shows
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
there
were
15
and
one
of
them
was
the
machinist.
i
could
read
all
15
your
honor.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
there
are
--
these
are
15
so-called
non-operating
unions
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
one
of
them
is
machinist,
i
have
the
abstracts
of
all
of
them
but
i
would
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes,
sir.
and
--
and
then
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
beg
your
honors
pardon?
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
i
don't
know
sir.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
didn't
single
them
out.
i
just
--
just
used
them
as
an
illustration.
those
are
some
of
the
things
which
concern
people
who
are
under
compulsion
to
subscribe
to
something
and
to
live
and
work
in
the
framework
of
such
an
organization.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
at
the
outset
that
neither
i
nor
my
clients
are
here
in
the
destructive
posture.
we
are
not
here
as
enemies
of
trade
unionism.
we
are
here
as
friends
of
the
constitution
needing
the
protection
of
the
bill
of
rights.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
have
not
undertaken
to
deal
with
the
corrupt
practices
act
or
any
other.
we
felt
that
to
do
a
shotgun
job
of
talking
about
foreign
aide
and
criminal
law
would
get
us
off
to
the
point
on
which
we
think
we
have
some
ground
and
on
which
we
refer
to
stand,
that
is
the
constitutional
point,
of
this
complex
of
federal
regulation
and
its
impact
upon
these
people.
we
are
aware
of
course
of
the
decision
in
the
hanson
case.
we've
read
it
many
times.
we
think
we
understand
what
was
in
the
court's
mind
in
dealing
with
it.
it
was
almost
as
if
that
case
was
decided
on
a
general
demurrer
to
a
statute
in
the
contract.
there
were
almost
no
facts
in
that
case
as
i
finally
put
note
in
my
briefs
to
show.
and
the
court,
with
great
portion
in
particularity,
said,
"let
it
be
fully
understood
that
that
case
deals
with
that
statute
only
on
its
face
not
on
what
its
application
might
be."
and
so,
this
case
comes
today
as
the
case
concerning
which
the
writer
of
the
opinion
refused
to
take
a
stand
against.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
on
its
face.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
collective
bargaining,
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
wise
for
me
today
to
spend
my
time
attacking
the
hanson
decision.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
it's
arguable
as
many
things
are
arguable,
it
is
arguable
that
even
to
require
a
man
to
submit
his
economic
prospects,
his
economic
affairs
against
his
will
to
a
set
of
people
whom
he
doesn't
follow,
that
that
in
itself
to
some
might
seem
(inaudible).
but
i'm
not
raising
the
question
on
that.
that's
over
the
dam.
i'm
seeing
that
assuming
we
follow
hanson
as
we
certainly
must,
we
are
not
bound
to
say
that
because
they
can
represent
us
in
collective
bargaining
between
the
employer
and
the
employee,
that
they
can
think
for
us
and
act
for
us
in
1001
capacities
unrelated
to
what
hanson
was
talking
about.
and
that's
the
question
we
raise
here.
we
think
that
the
most
sacred
of
all
rights
are
those
under
the
first
amendment.
and
then
if
a
man
is
going
to
be
a
man,
if
he
is
going
to
be
a
citizen
worthwhile,
he's
got
to
be
allowed
to
do
a
few
things
for
himself.
one
of
which
is
to
vote
and
to
promote
or
oppose
legislation
and
do
the
things
which
traditionally
men
have
always
done
for
themselves.
now,
we
said
in
this
lawsuit
that
the
application
revealed
here,
and
i
want
to
stress
that.
we
--
we
emphasize
that
the
application
of
2,
eleventh
and
the
contract,
and
its
impact
upon
these
pleadings
was
constitutional.
we
didn't
see
that
the
act
on
its
face
and
in
the
abstract
was
unconstitutional.
and
of
course,
we
have
any
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
which
says,
which
say
at
sometimes,
you
will
have
an
act
which
is
constitutional
on
its
face
and
unconstitutional
in
its
application
and
sometimes
almost
vice
versa.
we
want
to
emphasize
that
this
case
was
tried
on
the
--
with
the
phrase
and
to
the
extent
that
--
to
the
extent
that
they
are
doing
wrong.
to
the
extent
that
it
inflicts
certain
source
of
interest
on
these
--
these
plaintiffs
that's
unconstitutional.
we
are
not
trying
to
fly
in
the
teeth
of
the
face
fencing
the
door.
we
charge
that
--
that
what
is
being
done
to
the
plaintiffs
first
deprives
them
of
freedom
of
political
belief
and
association,
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
assembly
and
other
freedoms
under
the
first
amendment.
we
charge
secondly
that
it
deprives
them
of
their
right
to
work
and
their
funds
without
due
process
of
law
under
the
fifth
amendment,
because
this
whole
thing
is
predicated
upon
paying
or
firing
these
appellees
if
they
don't
submit
to
the
will
of
this
--
of
these
organizations.
thirdly,
we
say
it
deprives
them
of
their
political
rights
and
their
various
natural
rights,
their
dignity
and
integrity
and
individuality
which
have
been
preserved
to
the
people
of
this
country
under
the
ninth
amendment.
we
show
that,
in
effect,
this
organization
has
treated
all
from
the
idealistic
concept
these
organizations
have
i
believe
in
unions.
that
they've
become
involved
as
much
in
politics
as
in
collective
bargaining.
and
we
show
that
although
calling
themselves
collective
bargaining
agents,
they
are
in
sort
of
de
facto
political
organizations
not
calling
themselves
political
parties.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
they
are
unions,
yes,
sir.
what
i
mean
de
facto,
they
have
gotten
into
the
practice
of
politics
and
to
disciplining
their
members
to
a
considerable
expansion
and
indoctrinating
them
and
spending
a
great
deal
of
their
time
and
thought
on
the
political
aspects.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
that's
right.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
that's
right.
and
we
--
we
again
unless
we
be
misunderstood,
we
are
not
decrying
the
effort
of
any
men
or
any
voluntary
group
of
man
within
the
law
taking
part
in
the
government.
it's
the
highest
duty
of
men
i
suppose
is
to
take
part
in
government.
we
only
say
that
when
they
come
and
reach
out
and
ask
the
government
to
put
a
governmental
uniform
under
and
give
them
the
mace
of
authority
of
the
government
and
tell
us,
we've
got
to
join,
and
that
we
will
be
compelled
to
give
up
our
job
unless
we
view
to
their
political
thinking
or
contribute
and
support
their
political
goals.
we
say
then
that
they
have
departed
from
the
freedom
of
a
voluntary
individual
or
a
voluntary
organization
and
that
they
must
accept
the
usual
restraints
that
the
constitution
has
put
on
the
government.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
am
not
so
naïve
as
to
say
that
--
that
everything
is
easily
identified
always.
for
the
most
part,
the
things
we
are
talking
about
are
easily
identified.
and
i
think
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
legislative
promotion
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
it's
very
plain
to
me
that
it
is
political.
it's
legitimate
for
the
individual.
it's
legitimate
for
the
voluntary
group.
what
collective
bargaining
as
we
see
it
is
that
which
has
to
do
with
facilitating
the
negotiations
between
the
employer
and
the
employee
in
arriving
at
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
and
settlement
of
the
employment
disputes
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
is
political.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
don't
see
your
honor
how
that
you
can
see
or
how
anyone
could
see
that
promoting
or
opposing
the
legislation
is
in
itself
bargaining.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
if
your
honor
please,
i
note
several
times
in
the
briefs
of
my
adversaries
reference
to
something
as
being
in
the
interest
of
the
unions.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
think
your
honor
that
following
what
i
have
said
already,
we
must
keep
in
mind
that
where
the
constitution
denies
the
right
of
compulsory
support
of
things
one
doesn't
believe
in,
that
we
still
have
the
free
and
unshackled
rights
of
individuals
and
of
voluntary
organizations
to
promote
or
oppose
what
one
might
call
ameliorating
or
friendly
legislation.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
i
think
that
if
one
allows
the
promotion
of
legislation
to
be
included
in
collective
bargaining
concept
that
there's
no
end
to
where
we
go.
there
is
no
end
to
where
we
go
and
there's
no
end
to
where
the
freedoms
under
the
constitution
might
go.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
that
--
that's
our
view
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
sir.
the
amended
complaint
seeks
certain
relief
which
perhaps
i
ought
to
state,
we
seek
temporary
restraining
order
at
a
permanent
injunction
to
restrain
the
unions
and
the
railroad
from
enforcing
the
union
shop
agreement
and
from
discharging
any
of
the
petitioners
or
any
members
of
the
class
who
refused
or
to
join,
or
remain
members
of
one
of
the
15
unions.
we
seek
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
a
permanent
injunction.
second,
we
ask
that
the
union
shop
agreement
and
section
2
of
the
--
2,
eleventh
of
the
act
be
declared
unconstitutional
for
reasons
stated.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
as
applied.
as
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
and
that
we
have
not
undertaken
in
any
wise
to
infringe
upon
the
holding
of
the
hanson
case
as
we
understand
it.
thirdly,
we
sought,
we
ask
that
all
dues,
fees,
and
assessments
unlawfully
exacted
from
plaintiffs
and
the
class
be
restored,
and
that
the
plaintiffs
and
the
class
have
such
other
and
further
relief
including
monetary
damages
and
restoration
of
employment
where
equitable
as
maybe
necessary
adequately
to
protect
their
rights.
i
think
while
we
are
on
this
subject,
i
should
emphasize
that
we
had
a
general
precatory
clause
there
broad
enough
to
cover
whatever
form
of
relief
this
court
might
think
appropriate.
and
i
know
that
rule
54
of
the
rules
of
practice
approved
by
this
court
54
(c)
or
to
the
--
as
to
the
effect
that
in
the
--
in
federal
litigation,
it
is
proper
for
a
court
to
award
to
a
plaintiff
whatever
relief
the
facts
worth
without
respect
to
the
prayers
of
the
petition.
as
i
said,
there
has
been
a
very
thorough
trial
of
this
case
over
a
period
of
years.
and
we
have
established
that
the
dues
have
been
commingled
and
used
in
a
tremendous
number
of
ways.
in
this
short
period
considering
the
size
of
that
record,
it
would
be
utter
folly
for
me
to
undertake
to
review
the
details.
i
can
only
point
now
and
then
the
comment
made
by
my
adversaries
in
their
documents
giving
their
views
which
often
i
agree
with
as
to
the
tremendous
amount
of
evidence
and
it's
complete
as
in
this
case.
in
this
connection,
and
in
connection
with
the
colloquy
that
went
on
before
i
took
my
place
here,
i
would
say
that
our
work
has
been
a
colossal
undertaking.
it
has
been
burdensome
for
eight
--
i
mean,
for
six
working
people
to
put
together
this
record.
somebody
says,
what
shall
this
court
do
now?
shall
this
court
take
a
stand
or
shall
this
court
send
them
back
as
my
brother
the
solicitor
general
suggests
for
further
investigation.
well
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
are
not
positive
of
it.
we
--
we
prove
that
a
great
and
substantial
amount
were
illegitimately
expended.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
could
not
get
the
detail,
your
honor.
your
honor
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
we
would
not
like
unnecessarily
to
admit
it.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
don't
know
that
it's
--
it's
--
i
suppose
one
could
infer
that.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
we
have
cited
in
the
brief
and
we'll
not
be
able
to
go
into
detail
on
a
quite
a
number
of
cases
where
taxes
or
other
exactions
has
been
made
in
a
situation
which
was
unconstitutional
or
oppressive,
this
court
has
not
hesitated
to
strike
it
down
and
to
order
the
people
who
conceive
to
put
together
the
taxing
program,
a
scheme
of
whatever
it
was
to
come
forward
with
some
plan
of
giving
justice
to
the
individual,
it
being
readily
recognized
that
--
that
a
poor
workman
isn't
in
position
with
a
long
phrase
to
forever
litigate
the
economic
and
business
details
of
a
large
organization
like
these
unions.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
believe
it
should
until
the
people
who
have
charge
of
the
program
of
exaction
come
forward
and
make
a
showing
and
an
accounting
of
what
they're
doing
and
give
this
court
--
and
the
courts
below
an
opportunity
to
examine
it
and
find
out
whether
or
not
it's
right.
this
court
has
not
been
slow
in
times
pass
to
hear
the
call
of
the
oppressed
people
and
to
give
them
a
chance
to
cope
with
economic
and
statistical
matters
which
are
difficult
for
them
as
individuals
to
handle
as
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
have
established
beyond
question
the
basic
facts
we
set
out
to
establish.
i
say
this
with
all
deference
and
i
want
to
quote
the
other
side
as
to
what
they
said
about
it
--
it
shall
take
just
a
second
to
do
it
and
i
think
your
honor
we'll
say
that
we've
done
enough
to
interest
this
court
in
giving
us
constitutional
protection
here.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
would
say
that
if
the
unions
manifest
a
disposition
to
face
this
on
a
constitutional
basis,
i
mean
on
the
basis
where
the
constitution
is
respected,
and
if
this
court
would
firmly
declare
what
the
constitution
essentially
requires
and
condemn
things
which
obviously
are
admitted
here.
and
would
see
as
it
said
in
the
brown
case,
there
is
too
greater
diversity
for
this
court
to
pass
on
millions
of
children,
school
children
who
may
not
be
receiving
justice
but
it
will
denounce
the
basic
law
and
refer
the
latter
fact
to
the
courts
to
work
out
the
details,
because
i
--
there
are
infinite
combinations
of
circumstance
in
the
implementation
of
the
brown
decision.
there
are
infinite
combinations
of
circumstances
in
the
implementation
of
this
decision.
we
say
that
we
need
after
eight
years
and
after
making
this
record,
we
need
to
stable
from
this
court
that
essentially
the
basic
things
which
we
have
established
are
all
constitution.
and
that
the
court
below
and
any
courts
below
anywhere
in
this
country
shall
take
the
guiding
language
of
this
court
and
give
effect
to
the
constitution
on
the
broad
principles
enunciated
by
this
court.
may
i
say
just
a
word
here
on
what
we've
got.
your
honor,
i
know
i
hasn't
had
the
chance
to
read
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
your
honor
please.
we
--
that
will
never
be
an
end
in
detail
to
those
answers.
they
will
be
coming
up
forever.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
yes,
sir.
giving
money
to
candidates
is
an
easy
one.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
we
want
to
start
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
want
to
start
with
some
that
we
--
we're
talking
about.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
and
others
is
supporting
legislation
for
all
sorts
of
things
aid
to
far
east
or
aid
to
tva
or
anything
and
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
in
pardon
on
any
of
those
things
your
honor.
i'm
talking
about
the
constitution.
i'm
not
talking
as
a
parson
on
any
of
these
subjects.
but
i
want
to
say
we
have
done
more
i
believe
that
any
effort
that
who
has
ever
come
to
this
court
for
constitutional
relief.
i
--
we've
done
it
on
the
evidence.
i
want
--
i
want
to
just
quote
here
what
the
appellant
said
about
us
in
their
brief
at
page
103
in
their
main
brief.
they
said,
“on
august
14th,
1958,
a
comprehensive
stipulation
was
entered
into
by
all
parties.”
that's
in
record
165
to
205.
and
they
said
in
their
brief,
“in
said
stipulation,
the
union
defendants
conceded
virtually
everything
plaintiffs
might
contend
concerning
them
and
their
associates
and
affiliates.”
now,
that's
a
generalization
but
they
wouldn't
have
said
if
it
hadn't
been
so.
shall
we
go
further?
the
solicitor
general
in
page
8
of
his
brief
said
this,
“the
burden
of
facts
are
not
in
dispute
through
this
court.”
the
appellant
union
--
the
union
appellants
in
their
recent
response
brief,
the
appellants
have
four
briefs.
within
their
response
brief
of
december
15th,
they
declared
at
page
6,
"nor
may
be
it
said
--
nor
may
it
be
said
that
a
skimpy
record
was
developed
in
the
courts
below.
further
proceedings
in
any
case
are
hardly
likely
to
cast
any
additional
light
on
any
of
the
issues."
now,
that's
the
appellant
unions
talking.
the
stipulation
of
facts
particularly
paragraphs
19,
20
and
45
demonstrate
how
overwhelmingly
the
findings
of
the
court
was
supported
by
the
evidence.
the
solicitor
general
after
six
months
study
of
the
record
stated
in
his
brief
filed
in
november
and
i
quote,
"in
the
present
case,
the
record
shows
that
a
substantial
part
of
the
dues
and
fees
to
be
collected
from
the
appellees
will
be
expended
for
disputed
legislative
and
political
purposes."
and,
i
could
go
on
for
an
hour
or
two.
i
don't
believe
that
our
adversaries
and
i'm
considering
that
the
solicitor
general
is
operating
somewhat
in
our
position
with
us
today.
they
be
wouldn't
have
said
those
things,
had
we
had
a
short
record.
we've
got
a
record
that's
unprecedented
in
its
completeness
your
honor.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
would
say
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
would
say
very
quickly
that
the
salaries
of
the
--
of
the
bargaining
agents
who
sit
down
in
conferences
and
negotiate
contracts,
that
would
be
simple
and
easy
and
that
would
be
an
office
for
them
perhaps.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
an
office,
and
maybe
some
transportation
and
hotel
expenses
and
the
usual
things
that
go
with
negotiation.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
certainly,
if
they
give
their
full
time
to
this
type
of
thing,
if
they
go
off
and
do
other
things,
i
don't
think
we
should
have
to
support
them
in
their
legislative
operations.
all
those
things
your
honor
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
think
so
far
as
it
has
to
do
with
collective
bargaining,
it
could
be.
the
hanson
case
i
think
would
say
that.
it
wouldn't
say
that
he
should
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
legislation
and
politics
and
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
it's
my
view
that
we're
in
politics
there
your
honor
and
that
--
that
every
free
citizen
including
every
member
of
the
union
can
go
fight
that
politically
without
compulsion
and
on
his
own.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
fight
it
in
detail
and
he
can
--
and
--
and
the
union
as
a
voluntary
organization
can
do
that
with
voluntary
fund.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes,
sir.
a
great
deal
of
the
brief
of
the
afl-cio
and
the
appellants
here
is
devoted
to
the
fact
that
over
the
years,
they
have
done
this
sort
of
thing
and
that
they
wish
to
continue
it.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
believe
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
that's
right.
i
think
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
think
if
we
go
--
i
think
that
language
is
good
enough
to
travel
along,
and
if
this
court
will
condemn
in
positive
terms,
though
general
terms,
the
compulsory
use
or
exaction
of
money
from
working
people
on
pain
of
losing
their
jobs
and
will
direct
as
it
did
in
the
brown
case
that
this
be
taken
as
the
guiding
principle
we'll
have
no
trouble
cleaning
this
up.
we
--
someone
intermitted
a
while
ago.
if
--
if
this
goes
back
to
the
court
after
eight
years,
these
people
are
tired.
and
they
haven't
anything
to
go
by
except
to
shoot
at
the
stars
so
to
speak.
how
are
we
going
to
get
anywhere?
it
seems
to
me
that
brother
rankin
in
effect
is
saying
that
he
wants
us
decide
--
to
decide
all
the
details
before
the
general
proposition
as
(inaudible).
i
don't
think
this
court
--
i
can
think
of
a
good
many
cases
and
i'm
not
trying
to
be
pert,
i'm
trying
to
be
constructive
and
reason
from
action
of
this
court
before
us.
this
court
didn't
say
in
the
brown
case
that
you
have
to
take
a
roster
of
everybody
who
is
being
oppressed.
they
didn't
say
that
you
had
to
find
wherever
schoolhouse
was
and
whether
or
not
it
was
too
far
for
a
child
to
go
from
here
to
there.
it
laid
down
some
guiding
principles
which
it
regarded
as
sound
constitutionally.
and
it
depended
upon
the
courts
below,
and
it
depended
upon
the
courts
generally
to
recognize
what
it's
saying.
and
the
courts
below,
as
far
as
i've
seen,
have
been
recognizing
what
this
court
said
in
the
brown
case
and
giving
effect
to
it.
and
i
can
think
also
of
--
i
can
think
of
the
steele
case
which
was
a
little
different
but
it
has
the
same
idea
where
a
certain
league
of
firemen
were
being
oppressed
by
faceless
representation
on
the
part
of
the
union
which
was
claiming
the
representative.
this
court
didn't
send
that
–
stand
back
those
few
firemen
and
say
find
out
how
many
more
and
have
all
the
details
and
show
what
the
runs
are
and
so
forth.
the
court
recognized
that
injustice
for
what
it
was
and
the
court
condemned
it
and
immediately,
the
courts
below,
did
their
duty
and
everything
was
cleaned
up.
i
can
think
of
the
thompson
case
coming
out
of
louisville
where
the
procedure
was
a
little
sketchy
and
skimpy.
but
some
point
there
who
had
been
judged
up
for
nothing
at
all
and
was
led
through
and
fined
$10.
that
was
somewhat
de
minimis
maybe
but
this
court
hasn't
been
slow
to
recognize
rights
even
of
an
individual.
and
i
would
say
that
one
man
armed
with
his
natural
right
in
this
courtroom
can
stand
up
against
the
million
people,
and
these
eight
can
too.
and
so,
this
court
in
the
thompson
case
managed
to
work
out
an
appeal
from
the
police
court
of
louisville
to
this
court,
and
gave
justice
--
constitutional
justice
to
that
fellow.
and
i
can
think
of
terry
versus
adams
coming
out
of
texas
where
for
years,
in
certain
segment
had
been
denied
political
justice.
and
they
charged
that
a
concern
call
jay
bird
club
had
managed
to
deny
them
their
political
rights
as
this
court
look
through
in
the
form
of
that
situation
to
the
substance.
and
this
court
didn't
send
those
people
back
to
get
a
lot
of
statistical
detail.
he
said
this
thing
is
wrong.
it's
wrong
according
to
the
constitution.
we
lay
out
here
a
chart,
a
basic
chart,
and
we
will
give
the
encouragement
that
trial
judges
and
people
generally
need
to
know
the
things
that
are
constitutionally
wrong.
i'm
not
being
avoided.
this
court
has
not
looked
for
an
scheme
from
constitutional
duty.
and
i
know
it's
not
narrow
looking
for
anything
except
to
apply
the
constitution
as
it's
written.
it
would
be
far
late
–
far
late
for
us
to
go
back
after
eight
years,
after
what
they
have
said
about
the
proof,
the
massive
proof
that
we've
brought
into
this
case
and
be
sent
back
to
work
around
without
any
sense
of
direction
and
come
back
with
something
more.
we've
got
too
much
record
now.
so
much
record
we
don't
know
what
to
do
with
it.
we
just
asked
for
a
broad
guiding
principle
to
be
announced.
and
then,
we'll
have
no
trouble
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
it
wouldn't
--
it
wouldn't
do
any
good.
it
wouldn't
do
any
good.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
that's
right.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
they
have
cited
cases
to
the
effect
that
the
legislature
enacted
these
laws
with
that
in
mind.
they
--
they
have
challenged
us
on
the
point
and
said
that
that
it
is
the
constitutional
point.
we
say
that
if
it
is
--
if
this
case
has
decided
well
in
it,
it
will
act
as
a
guide
to
various
members
of
this
class
in
our
company
and
in
other
companies.
i
mean
in,
in
among
the
class
that
i
represent
and
we
can
proceed
to
get
the
accounting
for
the
class
and
others.
we've
got
the
six,
three
of
them
have
got
money
judgments
of
about
$150
a
piece.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
that
doesn't
keep
it
from
being
constitutionally
wrong
to
have
taken
a
substantial
part
of
it.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
if
there
is
any
--
well
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
i
think
in
a
great
many
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
have
cited
your
honor
a
great
many
cases
where
the
government
or
government
agency
overreaches
and
ask
for
too
much
for
road
rent
for
trucks
and
things
like
that
and
that
the
whole
thing
is
defeated
and
until
the
government
or
the
group
of
whoever
is
making
the
demands
explains
that
and
rectifies
it,
nothing
should
be
paid.
we
have
cases
here
from
this
court
to
that
effect.
we
would
rely
upon
those
cases.
if
there
is
anything
in
this
record
that
indicates
that
that
--
that
those
judgments
ought
to
be
for
$75
instead
of
$150
or
whatever
they
might
be,
well,
i
don't
know
that
there's
anything
of
that
sort
there.
we
say
that
if
the
thing--
if
the
exaction
is
corrupted
by
being
basically
wrong
constitutionally,
these
people
with
their
limited
means
shouldn't
be
required
to
conduct
a
detailed
economic
analysis
of
these
unions
at
distant
points
anymore
than
the
little
colored
child
in
any
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
i
suppose
that
this
court
concluded
as
i
hope
it
will
that
we
are
constitutionally
right
on
this
and
if
the
court
thought
that
the
record
was
wrong
on
the
dollars
then
the
court
could
say
it's
not
sustained
in
respect
to
the
amount
and
it's
sent
back
for
a
reevaluation
of
the
amount.
and
then
on
questions
of
other
matters
as
they
arise
from
time
to
time,
the
courts
would
have
to
work
it
out
like
they
worked
on
other
things
on
the
direction
of
this
court.
but
if
we
don't
make
a
start
your
honor,
we
never
get
into
where
we're
at.
no
one
can
charge
that
we
are
better
than
we
miss
in
our
preparation
to
this
case.
we
maybe
criticized
for
having
brought
too
much
here.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we've
tried
to
do
everything
we
could.
we
--
we
urge
that
our
constitutional
rights
be
recognized
and
given
effect
to.
now,
i
think
that
the
statements
of
opposing
counsel
on
the
good
many
matters
have
made
it
unnecessary
for
me
to
comment
on
the
subjects
that
i
had
intended
to
comment
upon.
it
seems
to
me
that
everybody
admits
now
that
quite
a
bit
has
been
done
beyond
the
scope
of
collective
bargaining.
everybody
admit
that
this
is
a
governmental
enterprise.
and
so,
i
don't
need
to
waste
the
court's
time
i
think
talking
about
that
--
something
is
here
about
the
organized
bar.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
the
hanson
case
found
that
it
was
affected
by
a
governmental
program
and
it
was
a
part
of
a
governmental
effort.
and
we
have
covered
in
great
detail
in
our
brief
pointing
out,
for
instance,
not
only
2,
eleventh
but
also
the
collective
bargaining
features
where
we
cannot
have
any
representative
except
these
representatives
and
provisions,
statutory
provisions
for
mediation
committees
and
emergency
committees
and
all
of
those
things
form
a
complex
of
governmental
sponsorship
of
a
national
labor
policy
for
the
government.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
quite
a
number
of
authorities
to
the
effect
that
when
people
assume
to
represent
the
government
or
even
individuals
that
within
a
certain
range,
the
principal
whoever
it
is
the
government
or
the
sponsor,
is
held
accountable,
i
mean,
that
the
whole
thing
connects
up
with
whatever
is
being
done.
and
so,
i
would
say
that
in
our
view,
there
is
no
question
that
particularly
if
they
call
it
--
they
call
it
collective
bargaining,
i
believe,
and
certainly
collective
bargaining
is
governmental.
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
the
analogy
to
the
organized
bar.
i
don't
want
to
get
sidetracked
on
it
because
i
think
that
i
should
stay
on
my
own
case
and
not
some
other
case.
but
since
i
will
not
be
here
tomorrow
and
that
and
the
subject
may
come
up
and
since
it
was
dealt
within
deep
in
this
case
slightly,
i
want
to
say
that
there's
a
distinction
between
the
organized
bar
and
the
labor
unions.
they
are
both
wholesome,
of
course,
in
their
conception
and
their
purposes.
any
organization
may
drift
away
from
its
idealism.
and
i
hope
that
when
i'm
through
here
that
nobody
gets
the
impression
and
i'm
here
attacking
any
organization,
labor
or
bar
either
because
i'm
not.
but,
the
labor
relates
to
a
common
occupation
and
the
law
relates
to
an
exclusive
profession.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
to
an
exclusive
profession,
specialized.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
possibly
not.
i'm
just
beginning
not
--
i
know
that
a
man
has
some
constitutional
rights
to
the
protection
of
his
right
--
his
status
as
practicing
law
i
know
that.
but,
in
one
case,
we
have
the
situation
of
a
man
entitled
as
to
matter
of
constitutional
right
to
work
as
a
laborer.
i
think
that's
been
recognized.
i
don't
believe
it's
been
recognized
that
every
men
has
a
constitutional
right
to
be
a
lawyer.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
to
protection.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
that's
right.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
now
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
hope
so.
i'm
coming
to
that
your
honor.
i
surely
think
so.
i
think
one
is
a
privilege
and
one
is
a
right,
but
as
a
constitutional
aspect
to
both
of
them.
as
will
be
shown
in
the
briefs
tomorrow,
and
i'm
taking
only
a
minute
on
this,
the
integrated
bar
was
conceived
by
the
american
judicatures
society
about
50-60
years
ago,
and
that
is,
of
course,
a
great
institution.
i
happen
to
have
been
closely
working
with
it
for
years.
it
was
designed
for
self
discipline
and
to
improve
the
moral
tone
of
the
bar,
pleases
all
the
ranks.
that
was
the
main
reason
for
it.
secondly
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i'm
not
denying
that.
i'm
giving
this
one.
it
is
--
it
is
to
improve
the
educational
standards
of
the
legal
profession.
that
was
possibly
the
second
point.
and
the
third
one
was
to
aid
the
courts
in
improving
--
improving
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
harley
who
was
the
founder
of
the
american
law
--
american
judicature
society
was
the
originator
of
this
idea.
now,
i
note
in
one
of
the
briefs,
one
of
my
adversaries
a
statement
identifying
some
great
men
of
this
country
were
in
the
integrated
bar.
and
certainly
it
is
a
wonderful
institution.
but
of
course,
any
institution
can
make
a
mistake.
the
best
of
them
do
the
churches.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
that's
right.
now,
they
mentioned
in
the
brief
that
i
think
you'll
have
before
you
tomorrow
three
great
men
whom
we
all
respect
-
elihu
root,
charles
e.
hughes,
and
robert
h.
jackson.
and
they
quoted
speeches
of
them
favoring
the
integrated
bar.
well,
it
was
one
of
a
blessings
of
my
life
to
have
been
a
close
friend
to
all
those
three.
and
i
need
to
stand
here
to
defend
them
or
to
emphasize
their
great
interest
in
freedom.
they
were
backing
the
integrated
bar
for
the
reasons
i
have
mentioned.
they
wouldn't
have
thought
of
sanctioning
the
integrated
bar
in
politics,
any
integrated
bar,
and
there
are
27
of
them
in
this
country
today.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
--
that's
a
generalization.
i
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
am
--
your
honors
question
is
the
generalization
but
i
would
say
that
they
could
be
acting
very
much
the
same
way.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
it
probably
is
your
honor.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
they
--
they
could
be
subject
to
direction
by
this
court
to
amend
their
ways
if
not
be
so
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
i'm
not
in
that
case
at
all
you
honor.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
and
then
i
would
prefer
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
i
mean
by
that,
i
prefer
not
to
take
the
leading
part
and
that
all
i
will
say
--
i
will
say
this
one
statement
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
i
do
know
that
the
legal
profession
of
this
country
as
well
as
anybody.
i
know
its
leaders
as
well
as
anybody.
and
it's
my
belief
that
there
is
not
a
single
bar
leader
in
this
country
who
would
willingly
advocate
the
practice
of
politics
by
any
compulsory
organization
whether
it
be
a
labor
union
or
a
bar
organization.
and
i
would
say
that
i
would
rather
see
every
bar
organization
in
this
country
stricken
down
and
dismantled
than
to
subtract
one
particle
of
the
force,
power,
and
dignity
of
the
bill
of
rights
from
that
great
body.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
the
american
bar
does
but
that's
a
voluntary
organization.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
don't
know.
i'm
not
a
member
of
an
integrated
bar
but
i
know
a
lot
of
them.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
the
--
the
question
came
up
when
we
were
here
last
april
your
honor,
and
one
member
of
the
bench
asked
the
question,
has
that
case
ever
been
here.
and
of
course,
it
hasn't
been
here.
and
i'd
be
sure
that
that
your
honors
will
deal
with
any
organization
which
may
be
running
afoul
of
the
bill
of
rights
as
it
does
in
any
other
organization.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
no
sir.
i
don't
know
the
facts
there.
the
--
the
wisconsin
bar
maybe
entirely
clean
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
because
it
was
put
in
the
brief
here
as
a
concept
and
because
your
honor
asked
me
the
last
time
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
your
honor
please.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
i
think
we've
all
got
to
respect
the
constitution
your
honor.
and
we've
got
to
respect
the
right
of
every
man
to
practice
his
own
politics.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes,
sir.
i
agree
with
it.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
yes,
sir.
now
your
honor,
just
a
word
or
two
about
the
form
of
relief.
if
we
are
sent
back
to
rework
this
without
any
specific
chart
to
go
by,
we
are
lost.
we
are
lost
in
confusion.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
--
we
don't
want
to
be
sent
back
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
--
we
don't
want
to
be
sent
back
at
all.
we
will
say
this.
that
if
for
any
reason
this
court
should
feel
that
there
is
nothing
yet
to
be
said
or
done,
we
would
say
that
we
need
a
broad
direction
from
this
court
recognizing
what
has
been
proven
here
and
making
constitutional
rulings
on
it
and
giving
direction
as
to
the
implementation
of
details.
but
if
your
honors
tell
us
that
we've
got
to
decide
all
everything
before
we
can
decide
anything,
our
people
have
the
physical,
spiritual,
or
other
resources
to
do
anything
about
it.
but
we
don't
intend
to
quit
and
we
want
to
keep
going.
what
we
do
need,
a
guiding
ruling
as
this
court
has
given
in
many
other
instances
comparable
to
this.
and
if
you
should
send
us
back
with
a
direction
to
do
it
all
over
again
without
affirming
the
constitutional
ruling,
which
has
been
made
below,
then
nobody
knows
what
the
score
is
or
how
to
project
the
trial
of
the
case.
but,
i'm
sure
this
court
doesn't
expect
every
conceivable
i
did
of
deviation
from
constitutional
use
to
be
anticipated
by
us
or
by
any
other
set
of
people
in
any
case,
just
as
it
hasn't
been
any
other
cases
that
i've
mentioned
where
your
honors
didn't
hesitate
to
give
relief
because
of
injustices
that
were
being
done
to
people
of
limited
resources.
so
we
would
urge
your
honors
to
affirm
this
decision.
i
would
call
your
honors
attention
to
this
fact
that
there
is
a
provision
in
the
decree
to
the
effect
that
when
and
if
these
defendants
will
come
back
and
make
a
showing
of,
they
didn't
used
this
expression,
but
cleaning
their
house
in
respect
to
these
abuses,
the
court
would
modify
or
vacate
the
injunction
to
adjust
it
to
the
equitable
rights
of
the
parties.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
advised
that
i
have
about
ten
minutes
and
i
hope
in
that
time
to
cover
some
six
or
eight
points
that
i
ought
to
comment
on
here
today.
may
i
start
out
by
saying
that
it
is
our
position
that
all
three
of
the
forms
are
relief
granted
by
the
trial
court
in
this
case,
that
is
the
declaratory
judgment,
the
monetary
judge
--
monetary
judgments,
and
the
injunction
are
appropriate
in
form
and
are
amply
supported
by
the
findings
of
the
trial
judge
and
by
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
and
therefore,
we
do
seek
the
affirmance
of
the
judgement
and
decree
of
the
court
below.
yesterday,
some
question
was
raised
about
the
difference
between
collection
and
expenditure
and
the
nature
of
those
two
incidents
of
this
whole
proposition.
it
is
our
position
that
the
collection
of
the
dues
and
the
making
of
the
expenditures
for
the
various
challenged
purposes
constitute
just
one
integrated
process,
so
far
as
the
appellees
are
concerned.
it's
all
a
part
of
the
required
membership
in
the
unions.
we
say
that
it
is
the
membership
which
the
union-shop
agreement
compels
and
not
the
collection
of
moneys.
my
clients
are
required
to
be
members
and
in
order
to
get
to
be
members,
they
have
to
pay
their
dues.
all
of
it
is
one
package.
that
membership
compelled
by
government
action,
takes
money
away
from
my
clients
and
also
makes
it
available
to
the
unions
for
legitimate
expenditures
or
for
further
expenditures
which
they
may
appropriate
it
to
without
authority,
or
in
abuse
of
their
authority.
in
other
words,
it's
all
in
one
package
and
we
do
not
subscribe
to
the
thought
that
the
collection
could
be
legal
and
the
expenditure
--
i
mean
that
they
can
be
separated
as
to
a
point
of
legality.
they
all
come
together
and
we
want
--
we
insist
that
they
be
treated
together.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
we
had
shown
here
by
overwhelming
evidence,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
--
well,
we
are
seeing
the
statute
and
the
contract
as
applied
here,
as
administered
here
and
they
say
that
that's
the
way
the
congress
intended
for
it
to
be
administered.
we
say
that
that
is
unconstitutional
and
should
be
stopped
on
constitutional
grounds.
we
do
not
have
before
us
a
case
of
where
this
statute
was
administered
strictly
along
collective
bargaining
lines,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
well,
they
have
shown
--
mr.
e.
smythe
gambrell
they
have
shown
a
legislative
history
and
they
have
shown
the
conduct
of
congress
over
this
period.
and
they
have
shown
many
other
things
which
they've
documented
very
completely
where
congress
has
refused,
when
reminded
of
the
abuses,
congress
has
refused
to
do
anything
to
ameliorate
it
or
correct
it
or,
to
more
specifically,
narrow
the
functions
down
to
what
we
claim
are
the
proper
functions.
i
want
particularly
to
mention
another
subject
which
came
up
yesterday
and
that
had
to
do
with
whether
or
not,
the
hanson
case
passed
upon
the
requirement
of
membership
in
addition
to
the
payment
of
dues.
i
rechecked
the
record
last
night
in
the
hanson
case,
because
i
wanted
to
be
on
solid
ground,
technically
and
otherwise.
and
i
find
that
in
the
hanson
case,
it
was
admitted
by
the
attorneys
for
the
other
side
that
there
was
not,
in
this
case,
any
question
of
compulsory
--
i
mean
in
the
hanson
case,
any
question
of
compulsory
membership
raised.
mr.
justice
black
asked
the
question
at
page
59
and
60
of
the
transcript
in
the
hanson
case.
he
says,
“does
this
relieve
him
from
being
compelled
to
subscribe
to
such
an
association
as
that?
if
you
don't
want
to
see
whether
it
does
or
does
not,
is
that
question
raised
here?”
and
mr.
schoene
says,
"i
think
it
definitely
is
not
raised
here,
mr.
justice
black."
that
is
commented
upon
on
page
8
of
our
december
20th
--
29th
brief
and
at
page
80
of
our
december
29th
brief
and
is
covered
very
--
very
fully.
and
it
shows
that
--
and
of
course,
the
decision
in
the
hanson
case
says
that,
"it
decides
only
that
in
effect,
the
members
shall
not
be
or
the
employees
shall
not
pre
writers."
it
--
the
language
of
course
is
not
that,
but
it
says,
"it's
narrowed
solely
to
the
matter
of
making
them
pay
their
part
of
the
financial
load
in
collective
bargaining."
so,
i
would
like
to
correct
or
clear
--
clear
my
statement
of
yesterday
and
say
that
we
do
not
believe
the
hanson
case
ever
intended
or
did
pass
upon
or
approve
compulsory
membership
because,
as
was
said
at
page
8
and
page
80
of
our
most
recent
brief,
it
was
not
even
dealt
with.
and
of
course
in
addition
to
that,
it
was
clear
in
the
hanson
case,
as
admitted
by
mr.
schoene,
reported
on
page
6
of
our
brief,
the
question
of
use
of
money
for
political
purposes
was
not
raised
by
the
pleadings
in
the
hanson
case.
so
for
two
reasons,
we
would
say
the
hanson
case
would
not
be
authority
to
say
that
in
this
case,
our
clients
or
the
class
could
be
bound
to
be
members
of
a
union
doing
such
as
admittedly
is
done
here,
practicing
all
forms
of
politics,
legislative
politics
and
electioneering
politics
and
such
matters.
i
wanted
to
get
that
clear.
now,
something
was
said
by
mr.
schoene
about
there
being
no
question
that
there
was
no
ideology,
no
indoctrination
program
in
this
case
that
no
contention
had
been
made
to
that
effect.
that
is
strictly
in
error,
because
we
have
developed
that
at
great
length
in
our
briefs
and,
of
course,
all
the
literature
which
we
had
to
buy
from
them
if
we
were
members
and
the
provisions
of
their
charters
and
bylaws
are
all
headed
in
the
direction
of
particular
doctrinaires,
which
were
constantly
put
in
our
hands
and
put
upon
us.
and
so,
that
is
one
of
the
big
phases
of
the
cases,
not
only
the
spending
of
money
to
elect
people.
not
only
the
spending
of
money
to
get
legislation,
but
the
spending
of
money
as
you'll
see
in
accordance
with
their
principles
as
stated
in
their
charters
and
bylaws,
all
of
which
are
in
the
record
show
that
they
are
seeking,
that
this
group
act
has
a
class
and
make
its
presence
felt
as
a
class
thinking
along
certain
lines.
they
even
went
so
far
as
to
say,
that
the
congress
ought
to
be
authorized
to
overrule
the
supreme
court.
i'm
not
mentioning
it
just
because
it
relates
to
this
body,
but
there
are
many
things
in
there
concerning
which
my
clients
might
have
some
disinclination
to
go.
and
all
of
that
is
a
part
of
the
general
program,
which
is
constantly
put
before
and
in
the
hands
of
our
clients
and
then
assisted
upon,
in
connection
with
the
associations.
some
point
was
made
yesterday
about
the
majority
having
a
right
in
a
compulsory
union
to
accept
the
policy,
of
course,
that's
not
so.
involuntary
organizations,
the
majority
can
rule
but
when
they
seek
the
cloak
of
federal
authority
and
when
they
go
into
the
arena
of
politics,
naturally,
every
man
is
harboring
of
himself
in
matters
of
politics
and
in
matters
of
election,
and
the
majority
was
never
intended
to
rule
there.
it
was
also
said
that
--
yesterday
that
my
clients
have
complete
freedom
to
do
what
they
wanted,
to
practice
their
politics,
all
they've
got
to
do
is
to
pay
their
money
in
and
then
go
do
what
they
please.
that
wasn't
said
in
the
case
of
jehovah's
witnesses,
where
people
salute
--
were
required
to
salute
a
flag
even
though
they
could
go
and
salute
a
hundred
other
flags
a
minute
later.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
