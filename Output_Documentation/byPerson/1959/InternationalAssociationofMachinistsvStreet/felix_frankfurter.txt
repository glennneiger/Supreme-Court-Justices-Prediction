justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
schoene,
before
--
may
i
interrupt
you
to
ask
this?
comparing
the
pleadings
in
the
hanson
case
and
the
pleadings
in
this
case,
what
issues,
if
any,
were
tendered
in
this
case
that
by
the
pleadings
were
not
before
the
various
courts
in
the
hanson
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
evidence
went
to
that
--
to
that
additional
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
ought
to
know,
but
i
don't
recall.
is
there
a
provision
in
the
railway
labor
act
comparable
to
the
english
legislation
whereby
an
employee
can
contract
himself,
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
think
if
there's
none
in
the
--
in
the
charter
of
the
union
itself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
in
any
with
your
familiarity,
is
there
--
that's
not
--
that's
not
unusual
in
the
united
states,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
legislation
by
congress
limit
the
use
of
union
funds
for
political
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
being
as
to
the
amount
and
is
due?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
by
implication,
therefore
allows,
does
not
regard
the
use
of
union
funds
within
the
limited
extent
as
perfectly
consonant
with
union
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kramer,
may
i
interrupt
long
enough,
to
ask
what
you
deemed
to
be
the
scope
of
the
decision
of
the
georgia
court
as
in
this
case.
what
is
it,
what
is
the
effect
and
suppose
that
decision
was
to
stand,
what
is
the
effect
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
because
of
the
terms
used
--
is
that
because
the
association
with
the
afl-cio
would
be
political?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
that
be
true
if
the
money
which
your
union
gave
was
earmarked
not
to
be
used
for
any
political
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
is
what
typical
and
ideological,
i
know
those
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
i'm
stating
whether
you
could
bring
yourself
within
this
decision,
or
you
just
say
none
of
our
money
can
be
used
for
any
legislative
purposes
are
on
their
heels.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
guess
the
reason
to
my
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
you
would
give
me
the
impression
that
using
--
that
as
the
georgia
statute
really
in
effect
overruled
our
decision
in
hanson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
said
you
can't
have
--
but
it
might
surprise
effective
union
activities
though
or
what
unions
can
do.
but
it
didn't
purport
to
do
that,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
--
but
you
could
abstract
within
yourself,
within
the
georgia
case
by
cutting
out
whatever
may
be
political
and
ideological.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
collective
bargaining
--
under
collective
bargaining
we
--
we
make
provisions
as
the
united
mine
workers
and
not
for
the
georgia
union
will
we
make
provisions
for
a
common
trust
fund
to
take
care
of
illness
and
contingency
of
that
sort,
may
you
not?
do
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
these
circumscribe
what
collective
bargaining
may
take
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
about
the
arguments
for
the
moment.
i
don't
mean
to
be
disrespectful.
but
in
the
opinion,
do
they
circumscribe
what
collective
bargaining
can
take
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
he
can
write
in
and
say,
“i
disapprove
of
your
making
this
claim
at
the
next
time
you
meet
with
the
--
an
employer”?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
--
my
difficulty
in
the
field
of
collective
bargaining
is
--
is
not
merely
on
wages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
basis
of
saying
that,
mr.
kramer,
in
the
opinion
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
--
was
there
a
decree
which
in
terms
defined
what
would
be
prohibited
under
this
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
burden
of
this
opinion
is
this
right,
this
agreement.
the
burden
of
this
opinion
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
sustained
the
compulsory,
a
closed
shop
agreement
on
railroads.
that
is
that
--
and
it
was
on
railroads,
must
join
a
--a
union
and
the
burden
of
this
opinion
is
to
circumscribe
what
union
activities
legally
may
be,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
--
it
says
the
constitutionally
what
collective
--
that
the
purpose
is
the
subject
matters
of
the
collective
bargaining
are
agreements
or
attempts
to
the
agreements,
defining
hours,
wages
and
working
conditions
in
the
narrow
sense
of
those
ends.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
even
some
union
members
have
strange
notions
of
liberty,
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
don't
want
--
they
don't
want
any
restrictive
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't.
it's
only
yesterday.
only
yesterday
in
the
matter
of
speaking
with
the
afl
oppose
minimum
wage
laws
for
women,
only
yesterday.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
no,
because
family
introduced
in
favor
of
men,
too.
therefore,
i'm
taking
about
the
course
of
events.
that
there
wasn't
--
wronged
people
have
got
the
nerves
about
such
things,
they
don't
want
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
(inaudible)
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
black
doesn't
cover
those
people
or
those
notices,
perhaps
a
chance
to
have
no
notions
of
liberty.
they
don't
want
any
kind
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
any
kind
of
state
intervention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sure
there
are
many
union
members
who
would
oppose
loosening
up
immigration
laws.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
--
if
the
machinists
contribute
either
per
capita
or
a
lump
sum
to
the
afl-cio,
and
the
afl-cio
will
come
out
to
mr.
jones
in
the
next
presidential
election,
i
think
that
he's
not
yet
announced
his
entry
into
the
primer
that
mr.
jones
may
have
in
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
jones
smith.
it
would
be
true,
would
it
not?
there's
no
use
in
gainsay
that
every
member
of
your
union
wouldn't
be
for
jones
smith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
of
part
of
his
money.
i
mean
is
there
any
point
to
denying
the
fact
that
some
of
these,
some
of
them
--
that
the
part
of
the
money,
a
fractional
part
of
the
money,
that
the
members
of
this
union
must
consider
in
order
to
become
members
of
the
union
and
therefore
in
order
to
be
able
to
get
a
job,
would
be
used
in
support
of
measures
and
then
the
‘x'
number
of
members
of
the
machinist
would
be
against.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
no,
my
question
is
staggering
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
of
staggering
the
individual.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so-called
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
free
fund.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
subscriptions
to
labor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
machinists
have
full-time
legislative
agents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
machinists
have
a
full-time
legislative
agent
around
that
work?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
where
they
are
trying
to
have
the
political
league
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
does
the
money
--
the
funds
of
the
political
league
as
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
finance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
come
out
of
the
general
fund.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
know
--
do
you
happen
to
know
the
proportions
about
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
does
invest
the
--
what's
the
scale
of
the
difference
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mr.
schoene?
well,
there's
a
substantial
amount
--
there's
a
substantial
amount
of
the
political
branch
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
was
the
source
in
the
funds.
and
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
the
sum
total
of
the
dues
that
come
from
the
international?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
international?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
guess
i
misconveyed
my
--
the
intent
of
my
question.
i
want
to
know
what
--
what
the
sum
total
income
of
the
international
through
membership
unions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what's
the
scale
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
$20?
justice
felix
frankfurter
$26.
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
got
a
new
brief,
mr.
shcoene?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
get
to
expend
--
before
you
get
to
the
expenditure
mr.
schoene,
you
have
to
--
you
have
acquisition
of
that
which
you
propose
to
expend.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
argumentatively
we
may
have
decided
this
case,
but
expressly
we
did
not
decide
this
case,
did
we?
i'm
not
saying
argumentatively
we
haven't,
all
i'm
saying
is
could
you
--
if
so
your
--
all
you
agree,
needed
to
do
is
to
cite
hanson
against
whatever
the
other
side
of
the
case
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean,
by
argumentatively,
but
you
spent
a
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
argue
--
you
don't
--
for
me
at
least,
you
have
to
argue
more
than,
i
think,
the
word
governmental
action,
and
so
well
defined
a
concept
or
a
phrase
with
complete
and
comprehensive
and
exclusive
content
that
everybody
would
give
at
the
same
content,
the
same
meaning
and
the
same
scope
in
the
prima
facie.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
the
so
called
8-hour
a
day,
everybody
who
knows
anything
about
this
knows
that
that's
a
euphemistic
term,
didn't
they?
well
as
much
vagueness
involved
in
it
as
much
as
ours
--
i
mean
what's
the
new,
wasn't
just
the
flat
8-hour
a
day,
you
can't
work
any
more
than
eight
hours.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
am
talking
about
the
law
there
had
held
back.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
the
agreement
of
eight
hours?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
relevance
of
this
question
anyhow
to
our
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
your
view
of
what
is
controlling
on
us
on
what
georgia
has
decided,
but
assume
we
all
agree
that
it
has
decided
without
qualifications
and
that
your
equal
protection
argument
is
in
tenures
for
considerations,
what's
the
relevance
of
that
to
our
problem
that
if
this
statute
--
if
this
nullify
the
right
to
work?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
whether
or
not
georgia's
illegalizing
your
--
nullifying
georgia's
law
on
that
point
matters
as
whether
or
not
the
federal
government
can
pass
any
enactment
which
sidetracks
or
displaces
that
allowance
by
the
state,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
thing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
has
that
any
bearing
on
the
first
amendment
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
collectively
see
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
this
--
you
are
not
suggesting
or
are
you
suggesting
that
because
you
can
now
have
a
collective
agreement
whereby
you
have
a
union
shop,
whereby
john
doe,
if
he
wants
to
work
on
that
railroad,
must
he
belong
or
join
that
union
and
pay
assessments,
union
assessments,
but
since
they're
now
authorized
to
make
such
an
agreement,
at
least
the
federal
government
has
removed
the
bar
against
making
them,
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
removed
the
bar
against
making
them,
it
doesn't
forbid
it.
therefore
any
expenditure
for
any
purpose,
for
any
purpose
is
not
challengeable
by
a
member
of
the
union?
it's
not
properly
within
the
purview
of
what
fund
could
be
expended?
can
they
therefore
--
can
they
therefore
make
a
contribution
to
some
outlaw
--
legally
outlawed
organization?
and
a
member
of
the
union
can't
come
in
and
say
this
is
--
to
put
in
the
most
neutral
terms,
as
you
said,
the
ultra
vires
expenditure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
the
abstract
way
to
which
you
put
it,
because
the
government
allowed
them
to
make
a
contract,
therefore,
future
expenditures
are
not
subject
to
scrutiny.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
we
--
why
do
we
have
to
think
out
and
imagine
all
the
conceivable
constitutional
--
when
you
say
constitutional
limitations,
do
i
have
to
decide
--
i
only
have
to
worry
about
my
own
views
about
this
thing.
do
i
have
to
decide,
yes
or
no
that
constitutional
limitations
do
apply
or
they
don't?
is
that
the
question
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
is
there
any
question
before?
i
mean
that
i
have
to
search
all
the
possibilities
within
the
constitution
to
find
out
whether
something
maybe
done
under
such
an
agreement,
which
may
bring
into
play
something
which
is
--
which,
when
they
conclude
is
not
authorized
or
whatever
it
is,
is
not
permitted
for
the
union
--
the
railroad
union,
by
virtue
of
the
labor
act.
i
don't
know
why
you
argue
this
all
in
this
abstract
way,
i
really
don't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
any
idea
of
what
i
think
about
this
case
from
anything
that
i've
said.
you
couldn't
possibly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'd
never
put
--
i
wouldn't
agree
with
putting
the
question
in
this
case
in
those
terms.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
i
couldn't
agree
with
you,
and
neither
disagree,
and
since
it's
very
important
what
question
is
put
in
order
to
decide
what
answers
is
there.
i
don't
start
up
with
that
problem,
to
tell
you
frankly.
in
other
words,
you're
making
the
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
just
telling
you
my
difficulty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it's
unconstitutional
on
this
abstract
mode
of
the
argument
that
seemed
to
(inaudible),
then
it
hasn't
superseded
because
congress
has
done
something
that's
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
other
argument,
your
other
answer
to
justice
black
that
he
wouldn't
be
relieved
with
all
taxations,
suppose
(inaudible),
aren't
you
--
aren't
you
in
that
answer
or
by
that
answer
playing
in
the
solicitor
general's
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kramer,
so
far
as
you
understand
although
it
is
more
important
if
i
may
say
so,
so
far
as
the
practice
has
been
since
hanson,
that
hanson
applies
to
employees
--
past
employees
who
may
have
been
--
who
may
have
had
to
argue
rights
for
5,
10,
15,
20
years,
and
one
of
these
operation
fellows
says
i
don't
want
to
belong
to
a
union,
would
he
have
to
belong
after
hanson?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
could
be
drawn
out
of
a
job
that
he
has
had
for
20,
30
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
he
has
only
deepest
--
with
the
deepest
conviction
that
he
doesn't
believe
in
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
asking
you
what
has
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
has
been
practiced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
every
fellow
after
--
after
is
in
situation
in
which
the
railroad
and
the
brotherhood
make
a
closed
shop
agreement
where
lengths,
the
duration,
the
seniority
of
the
existing
employee
do
not
save
them
from
the
specificity
of
joining
the
union
if
they
wanted
to
stay
on
that
railroad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
there
anything
in
hanson
that
would
give
anybody
an
out
if
he
legally
wants
to
contest
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
that
basis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least
i
don't
know
of
anything
in
hanson
that
would.
there
were
two
reservations
in
hanson
and
i
don't
think
that
was
included
in
either
one.
i
would
like
to
point
out
also
that
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
show
that
any
plaintiff
ever
made
any
objection
to
the
union
against
any
of
these
expenditures,
never
told
them
he
didn't
want
it
made
with
his
money.
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
any
expenditure
involved
any
of
these
particular
persons
personally
as
distinguished
from
the
whole
group
and
a
whole
group
of
expenditures.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
simply
sat
back,
made
no
complaints,
made
no
request
of
the
union,
if
he
had
made
a
request,
you
don't
know,
the
union
might
have
complied
with
it,
might
not.
there's
no
way
of
knowing.
it
was
simply
sat
back,
waited
through
an
expenditure,
well,
didn't
wait,
he
actually
started
a
suit
before
the
union
shop
agreement
became
effective
as
to
here.
these
–
this
suit
was
brought
within
the
60-day
period
that
the
man
had
to
comply
with
the
union
shop
agreement
after
its
effective
date.
but
they
had
a
preliminary
injunction.
some
expenditures
were
made
after
that
and
that
they
disagree
with.
what
fraction
of
the
total
is
involved,
we
don't
know.
what
particular
expenditure,
whether
it
was
a
contribution
to
the
red
cross
that
he
objects
to
or
the
activity
to
the
affl,
because
we
contributed
to
the
affl.
they
complained
of
that,
five
cents
per
man
per
month.
the
affl
spends
its
money
in
a
great
variety
of
ways
that
contributes
money
to
a
labor
college
in
kenya
and
africa
to
educate
the
african-negroes
in
the
trade
union
movement.
he
can
object
to
that.
going
to
the
courts
of
georgia,
i
found
such
a
showing
according
to
the
courts
below,
he's
entitled
to
relief
against
the
union
shop
in
its
entirety.
now,
they
seek
to
justify
that
kind
of
a
decree
upon
what
i
consider
the
fantastic
basis
of
brown
against
the
board
of
education.
they
talk
about
the
decree
below
as
though
the
decree
below
in
this
case
were
a
mandatory
injunction
ordering
the
unions
to
terminate
certain
activities
with
all
deliberate
speed,
and
imposing
upon
the
unions
the
obligation
of
dividing
and
presenting
to
the
court
a
plan
of
compliance.
well,
this
--
the
decree
below
doesn't
bear
to
be
modest
resemblance
to
that.
the
decree
below
in
this
case
totally
and
instantly
from
that
moment
forward
enjoined
the
entire
operation
of
the
union-shop.
it
didn't
tell
the
unions
to
do
anything.
the
sole
reservation
was
that
if
the
unions
come
back
and
show
the
court
that
they
no
longer
engaged
in
any
of
these
activities,
that
is,
they
no
longer
are
affiliated
with
the
affl-cio.
they
no
longer
affiliated
with
railway
labor
executives'
association.
they
no
longer
appear
before
the
congressional
committees.
they
no
longer
made
charitable
contributions.
if
the
union
would
do
all
that
that
unions
have
been
doing
ever
since
their
existence,
then
the
decree
would
be
resolved.
when
they
say
in
their
brief
as
they
do
that
the
court
below
declared
the
fundamental
rights
and
imposed
upon
the
appellant
unions,
the
obligation
of
dividing
and
presenting
a
plan
to
implement
the
basic
rights
of
the
appellants,
they're
indulged
in
pure
fantasy.
as
i've
said
before,
the
decree
totally
and
instantly
forbade
any
application
of
the
union
shop.
that
kind
of
decree
needs
no
implementing.
that's
it.
and
that's
the
decree
from
which
we're
appealing.
now,
we
phrase
that
point
only
if
all
our
arguments
on
the
merits
are
wrong.
the
record
in
this
case
is
quite
voluminous.
on
this
record
without
any
showing
of
any
request
that
the
unions
not
violate
what
they
allege
are
their
rights.
without
any
showing
of
any
personal
harm
from
any
individual
expenditure,
the
only
possibility
is
to
reverse
and
remand
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
there's
nothing
here
to
support
any
kind
of
injunctive
decree.
we
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
our
time
if
we
may
for
rebuttal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
unless
there
are
some
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
content
do
you
give
or
what
--
or
when
does
one
derive
a
content
for
what
you
just
called
regular
union
activity?
what
constitutes
irregular
union
activities
so
it's
not
to
be
regular
union
activity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
--
the
reason
i
asked
the
question
is
that
on
the
government
suggestion,
they
send
it
remand
--
normally
when
this
court
send
the
case
back
on
remand
because
the
action
taken
was
improper
or
excessive
or
what
not,
it
is
--
it
is
desirable
to
convene
not
the
necessary
judicial
practice
to
indicate
to
the
lower
court
the
basis
on
which
they're
to
correct
what
was
found
to
be
incorrect
or
excessive.
so,
what
kind
of
guidance
does
this
court
gives
for
the
determination
by
the
georgia
court
as
to
what
are
regular
union
activities
and
what
are
not
regular
union
activities?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
either
implicitly
or
explicitly,
we've
indicated
by
what
standard,
by
what
criteria
of
facts
to
be
developed
which
had
not
been
developed
on
the
record
as
it
came
here
should
be
judged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
what
--
what
is
the
georgia
court
on
your
theory
could
do
in
ascertaining
whether
x
dollars
go
to
the
labor
(inaudible)
is
running
a
newspaper
which
is
full
of
political
stuff
-
and
i
do
not
use
the
word
"stuff"
derogatory
as
i've
read
that
paper
before
i
don't
know
what
30
or
40
years.
how
was
it
georgia
court
to
ascertain
--
what
--
what
guidance
are
we
to
give?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
--
what
about
moneys
contributed
--
sympathetically
to
support
the
belgian
strikers.
what
about
--
i
could
go
on
and
enumerate
endless
money
conventionally
paid
by
union
for
the
last
50
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
federal
statute
has
prohibited
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
--
have
we
indicated
that
a
union
contribution
to
local
campaign
is
constitutionally
barred
anywhere?
if
so,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
indicated
--
have
we
indicated
that
which
–
unless
all
my
reading
of
labor
matters
has
gone
for
nothing
for
nearly
60
years
that
one
of
the
most
frequent
and
conventional
contributions
by
union
is
to
defeat
so-called
enemies
of
labor?
if
that
is
the
conventional
union
expenditure,
then
i
don't
know
what
a
conventional
union
expenditure
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
a
federal
case
dealing
with
the
federal
statute
under
penumbra
of
a
federal
statute.
i
don't
think
we
remotely
had
before
us
to
what
a
state
can
do
taking
out
of
consideration
all
the
practice
of
interstate
commerce
as
to
what
a
state
can
do
in
allying
to
not
to
be
prone
for
union
activity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
respect
if
you
know
--
if
you
tell
me,
but
i
did
know
what
i
was
dealing
with.
i
wasn't
dealing
with
that
problem
in
the
cio.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
dealing
with
the
united
states
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understand
you
to
say
that
it's
clear
to
you
and
that
you
submit
as
your
view
that
it
violates
the
federal
constitution
under
the
authorization
of
--
what
is
it
eleventh
--
2,
eleventh,
that
it
violates
the
first
amendment
under
the
--
under
the
authority,
the
claimed
authority
of
that
provision
of
law
to
allow
assessments,
moneys
coming
in
for
assessments
to
be
used
in
any
way
for
the
promotion
or
the
defeat
of
political
candidates.
i
understand
that.
i
just
want
to
go
on
from
there
and
say
what
other
things
does
this
court
in
georgia
judge
and
what
other
standard
--
by
what
other
standards
that
he
could
be
guided
in
saying,
you
can
do
this
and
you
can't
do
that.
you
say,
we
can't
tell
on
this
record.
we
have
to
explore
to
what
uses
these
moneys
were
put.
suppose
he's
found
all
that,
how
did
he
tell
which
is
on
the
right
side,
which
is
on
the
wrong
side,
which
is
on
the
elicit
side
and
which
is
on
the
illicit
side.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said,
ordinary
--
that
point
that
i
(inaudible),
you
said
ordinary
trade
union
activities.
now,
how
do
we
ascertain
what
ordinary
is?
i
contested
one
case
namely
that
this
statute
wasn't
drawn,
this
wasn't
pulled
down
from
the
table,
this
was
dealing
with
an
existing
situation.
with
a
long
course
of
history
by
trade
unions
in
making
collective
agreement
and
settling
views
and
other
assessments
and
putting
those
funds
to
use
is
a
large
body
of
experience.
and
normally
one
would
suppose
that
congress
is
acting
with
reference
in
existing
situation,
namely,
as
to
what
the
things
are
which
go
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
to
what
uses
of
moneys
are
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
start
with
that
as
a
postulate?
is
that
in
the
first
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
start
with
that,
you'll
end
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
if
--
if
the
kind
we've
held
in
hanson
that
the
dealers
--
the
deepest
conviction
of
a
railroad
worker
maybe
overruled,
a
tank
may
go
over
it
if
the
majority
of
the
union
agree
to
have
a
closed
shop.
and
if
he
doesn't
like
it,
he
can
leave
his
employment.
if
that
is
an
expression
of
the
first
amendment,
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
what
does
the
cover
means?
the
word
was
a
"cover."
cover
to
me
usually
means
not
a
truthful
representation
of
the
facts,
a
pretense,
an
unreality.
so,
cover
in
the
technical
legal
term
to
which
--
from
which
i
can
draw
the
answer
to
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
decided
this
case
in
hanson?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
decided
it
the
way
you
are
now
arguing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
therefore,
it's
--
therefore,
we
are
arguing
this
thing
here
for
the
first
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
didn't
decide
it
by
any
implication
as
to
what
cover
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
left
open
the
question
that
is
now
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
myself,
i
have
no
trouble
in
saying
that
this
question
was
not
adjudicated
enhancement.
by
leaving
a
question
open,
you
squid
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left,
nor
to
the
center.
you
leave
it
open.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
left
open
the
question
to
which
you're
addressing
yourself,
namely,
in
the
interplay
between
the
majority
and
minority
in
a
union,
how
may
that
interplay?
how
may
that
relationship
be
determined?
would
you
regard
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
governs
everybody
and
everything
including
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
solicitor
in
hanson,
we
have
to
deal
with
majority
and
minority.
that
was
the
crux
of
hanson
that
there
was
a
minority
who
said
you
can
steamroller
us
into
belonging
to
a
union
when
our
deep
religious
conviction
is
against
the
union.
and
we
said
as
to
that,
the
first
amendment
is
no
bar.
and
we
said,
the
minority
view
maybe
overruled
and
rejected
and
subordinated.
why?
well,
a
lot
of
considerations
touching
the
status
of
union
in
our
society.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
that
involved
in
that
was
that
although
there
was
a
suppression
of
a
minority
view
which
normally
i
should
think
came
within
the
first
amendment,
there
were
other
considerations
which
subordinated
that
minority
view
to
compulsion.
that's
what
hanson
is,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
and
that's
why
we're
hearing
it
twice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
solicitor,
my
problem
isn't
quantity
but
quality
if
i
may
say
so.
not
amount
of
money
but
category.
you
make
clear
as
to
both
supporting
a
candidate
or
opposing,
what
about
legislative
activities
for
against
measure?
what
about
that
as
a
category?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
need
–
do
we
need
testimony
in
court
that
interest
between
labor
and
farm
had
such
relevance
that
those
who
sold
democratic
processes
control
a
union
may
feel
it
important
to
have
wide
farm
legislation?
what
about
tva
legislation?
what
about
tax
measures?
would
this
be
the
issue
that
would
be
developed
before
a
judge
in
georgia
or
anywhere
else
and
on
the
evidence
this
included
that
on
the
whole,
that
congress
was
not
justified
in
saying
that
the
labor
has
an
interest
in
tva
or
tax
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
it
--
if
i
may
save
your
time.
i
understand
that
your
argument
only
apply
that
there
are
dissenters,
but
my
question
takes
that
into
account.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
may
a
dissenter,
a
fellow
who
says,
that
farmers
are
being
cuddled,
and
they
have
been
always,
tva
is
socialism
supporting
an
international
aide
is
unwise,
aren't
support
for
america,
may
those
who
hold
those
views
as
against
a
controlling,
a
democratically
controlled
union,
may
those
people
say
no,
i
will
continue
to
belong
to
the
union
but
i
won't
allow
any
of
my
money
to
go
for
those
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
certainly,
nobody
can
object
to
somebody
else
using
his
own
money.
we
haven't
gone
that
far
in
the
application
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
this
act
destroys
or
nullifies
the
power
that
51%
of
the
union
have
to
say
--
didn't
have
the
statute
but
it
can't
be
exercised
because
of
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
mr.
gambrell,
the
machinist,
i
don't
quite
get
this
--
this
was
a
contribution
to
the
machinist?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
just
want
to
know
whether
the
--
the
brotherhood
–
is
this
the
brotherhood
supported
the
machinist?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wondered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
machinists
aren't
self-sustained,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
it
was
news
to
me
that
the
machinists
were
not
self
sustained.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
statement
imply
doesn't
it,
mr.
gambrell
of
what
you
call
political
inseparable
--
separable
from
this
joint
of
unrelated
not
in
principally
part
of
what
you
call
trade
union
interest
and
exploits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
legislative
promotion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
or
that
political?
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
legislation
which
maybe
fit
the
opportunity
of
doing
that
had
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
political.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although,
legis
--
by
legislation
which
removed
the
shackles
from
enabling
collective
bargaining
to
be
possible,
that's
political.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
saying
it.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
promoting
legislation
that
abolishes
yellow
doe
contract
is
about
as
close
in
interest
of
the
trade
union
as
anything
one
can
conceive
of.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
use
that
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
use
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
saying,
if
we're
going
to
recognize
the
union
and
their
position
in
society
and
their
relation
in
society's
well
being,
then
i
have
great
difficulty
unless
it's
made
clear
to
me
where
that
purpose
of
a
union
which
congress
may
further
end
and
where
politics
begin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
starting
point
is
no
longer
valid,
because
hanson
compulsorily
compels
a
man
to
belong
to
a
union,
although
his
lowers
the
idea
and
it
goes
against
his
deepest
conviction.
now
you
say,
that's
water
over
the
dam,
but
we're
now
determining
how
much
more
water
should
go
over
the
dam.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
it's
very
clear
in
answer
to
question
of
mine,
mr.
gambrell,
at
least
as
i
understood
you
very
clearly
that
you
withdraw
the
circles,
you
would
confine
the
territory
for
lawful
expenditure
to
purposes
directly
and
immediately
related
to
the
collective
bargaining
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
--
that's
what
i
got
from
your
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
to
me
is
a
very
clear
outline.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
that's
a
constitutional
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
think
you're
deeply
in
it,
mr.
gambrell.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
gambrell
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
-–
your
suggestion
i
think
it
is
that
you
don't
pay
for
the
junk
mail
that
you
don't
look
at.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you
got
this
set
forth
in
your
brief,
but
i
don't
like
leave
oral
argument,
mr.
schoene.
why
are
you
opposed?
what
is
your
objection
to
the
government's
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
your
objection
to
the
government's
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
are
you
saying
that
or
does
that
mean
that
on
the
record,
the
complaint,
if
that's
what
it
was
in
a
motion
or
whatever
the
pleadings
were,
the
finding
that
base
a
judgment
exclusively
on
the
legal
materials
which
compel
judgment,
nothing
has
been
shown
that
these
were
involved,
occurs
taking
of
money
from
somebody's
pocket
for
unconstitutional
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
change
my
--
broaden
my
question.
are
you
saying
that
on
the
pleadings
and
stipulations
in
this
case,
there
is
no
showing
or
no
allegation
to
justify
determination
that
the
money
was
coercively
contributed
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
for
expenditures
that
are
illegal,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
whether
constitutional
or
statutory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
other
words,
there
has
to
be
illegality
in
what
the
union
is
doing
to
coming
--
to
come
here
and
say
that
a
federal
right
has
been
infringed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
--
i
must
return
to
the
broadening
i
gave
to
my
question.
isn't
it
--
it
isn't
nearly
whether
what
was
done
here
under
such,
such
authorization
or
call
it
what
you
will,
under
such
connection
as
the
--
what
is
it,
2,
eleventh
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
such
connection
as
that
has
and
what
was
done
here,
does
it
violate
either
the
claimed
violation
of
the
first
amendment
or
does
it
go
beyond
what
2,
eleventh
authorizes
you,
by
impliedly
restricting
the
authorization
for
collective
agreement
to
allow
no
money
is
to
be
collected,
except
to
be
expended
for
the
process
of
collective
bargaining?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
do
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the
statute
might
--
the
statute
--
the
authorization,
which
congress
gave
by
that
amendment,
may
have
confined
the
conditions
under
which
you
may
make
a
union
or
closed
shop
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
it
has
--
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
did
–
it's
the
provisions,
but
i
mean
as
to
this
problem.
certainly
it
did,
but
i
mean
as
to
this
problem,
congress
could
explicitly
have
spelled
out
certain
modes
by
which
dissident
members
of
the
union
could
withdraw
their
contribution
that
they
are
set
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
there
maybe,
in
other
ways
impliedly,
almost
all
legislation
carries
with
an
implication,
if
only
the
implication
of
the
context
in
which
it
is
to
be
construed,
impliedly
asked
that
you
would
be
--
you
would
be
running
up
against
the
statutory
controlling
limitations,
if
any
such
implication
could
be
spelled
out
from
217
–
2,
eleventh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
it
isn't
merely
a
constitutional
limitation,
but
direct
or
implied
statutory
limitation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
your
right
to
have
a
closed
shop
derives
from
congress.
