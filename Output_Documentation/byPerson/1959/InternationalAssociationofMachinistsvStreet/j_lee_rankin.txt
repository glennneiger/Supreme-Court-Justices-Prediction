mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
is
that
the
decree
of
the
lower
court
should
be
reversed.
the
case
should
be
sent
back
for
an
examination
of
the
various
activities
that
are
complained
about
by
the
appellees
in
this
proceeding
to
determine
which
ones
intrude
upon
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
appellees
and
limit
the
relief
to
an
injunction
against
the
expenditure
of
the
funds
for
those
purposes
which
are
an
intrusion
upon
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
appellees.
united
states
thinks
there
are
several
fundamental
interest
involved
in
this
proceeding.
one
is
the
fact
that
there
is,
as
this
court
said
in
the
hanson
case,
governmental
activity.
there
is
compulsion
to
become
a
member
of
this
union
in
order
to
retain
a
job
by
reason
of
this
statute
and
the
agreement
made
by
the
allowance
of
the
statute.
therefore,
the
payments,
the
dues,
initiation
fees,
and
assessments,
and
this
court
carefully
excluded
fines
and
penalties
as
you
recall
in
hanson.
but
those
elements
of
payment
are
made
by
a
reason
of
the
statutory
allowance
of
these
agreements
for
a
closed
shop
or
union
shop
to
remain
in
these
industries.
and
we
think
that
presents
a
different
problem
in
regard
to
the
constitutional
questions.
now,
there
are
also
the
rights
of
the
majority
to
express
their
interest
in
regard
to
legislation,
political
activity
and
all
of
the
myriad
of
areas
that
are
described
in
this
complaint
by
the
appellees.
they
do
have
constitutional
rights
to
that
expression.
and
those
must
be
recognized
and
protected.
then
there
is
the
question
of
the
dissenters
and
their
constitutional
rights
under
the
first
amendment
not
to
be
compelled,
as
is
stated
here
and
the
government
accepts
that,
to
contribute
to
an
expression
of
ideas
which
are
inapplicable
or
unacceptable
to
them.
those,
in
broad
outlines,
are
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
now,
we
say
the
statute
is
constitutional
as
this
court
held
in
the
hanson
case,
because
it
never
contemplated
that
these
dues
and
assessments
and
initiation
fees
would
be
used
for
unlawful
or
unconstitutional
purposes,
that
it
was
implied
that
when
congress
provided
that
such
agreements
should
be
--
could
be
made,
that
any
person
who
contribute
as
he
was
required
to
in
order
to
become
a
member,
in
order
to
get
a
job
where
there
was
such
an
agreement,
those
funds
would
only
be
used
for
purposes
that
were
lawful
and
constitutional.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
united
states
takes
the
position
that
this
record
is
not
adequate
for
the
court
to
try
to
draw
that
line.
we
think
that
there
are
some
that
would
be
a
violation
of
those
rights.
and
those
are
where
it's
submitted
that
their
contributions
to
political
campaigns,
although
it
isn't
a
violation
of
corrupt
practices
act,
because
it
isn't
in
regard
to
federal
office.
but
it
still
is
in
regard
to
local
and
municipal
office
a
contribution
to
the
direct
campaign
of
an
individual.
now,
we
think
that
is
getting
on
the
far
edge
of
anything
that
could
be
sustained,
because
there,
the
dissenters
maybe
and
well
--
and
it's
shown
here
that
some
of
them
are
--
they
are
supporting
and
want
to
support
the
opposing
candidate,
and
yet,
they
are
required
to
contribute
funds
to
help
elect
the
man
that
they
would
wish
to
defeat.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
are
--
the
georgia
court
has
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
the
contracts
completely
and
the
payment
of
any
dues.
and
we
think
that
is
going
far
beyond
what
the
court
should
do
here
that
there
are
activities
that
are
in
the
area
that
are
proper
expression
of
the
majority
that
they're
entitled
to
protection
of.
and
there
are
activities
that
the
minority
or
dissenters
could
not
properly
object
to
where
they
are
a
germane.
so
that
--
and
there
are
large
amounts
of
money
that
are
collected,
that
are
spent
for
regular
union
activities
of
all
the
kinds.
but
this,
the
georgia
court
has
enjoined
the
payment
of
anything
toward
any
purpose,
and
that
is
where
we
say
the
decree
has
gone
too
far.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
order
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
it
depends
upon
the
record
of
the
case
before
you
in
the
past
whether
or
not
you've
tried
to
delineate.
you
have
when
you
could
try
to
give
guidance
to
the
court
upon
returning
a
case
to
it,
as
to
the
various
limitation
or
standards
or
principles
that
might
govern.
if
the
record
was
so
incomplete
that
you
couldn't
for
yourselves
ascertain
what
those
standards
should
be
and
didn't
want
yet
to
pass
upon,
you
have
sent
them
back
for
a
further
development
of
the
record
as
to
the
facts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
regard
to
what
are
regular
union
activities,
i
think
there
are
--
there
is
an
answer
to
that
that
is
easiest
in
that
many
of
the
--
the
conduct
of
their
meetings,
the
fact
that
they
have
to
have
officers
and
they
have
to
be
paid,
that
all
of
the
various
--
the
offices
that
they
have
to
have
and
all
of
those
things.
now,
the
contribution
by
these
dissenters
toward
those
things
that,
under
their
own
definition
of
what
is
germane
to
collective
bargaining,
would
seem
to
clearly
apply
is
enjoined.
so
they
--
they
are
not
required
under
this
decree
to
contribute
anything
to
those
regular
activities
or
usual
activities
to
a
union
which
are
necessary
for
it
to
carry
on
the
function
of
collective
bargaining
itself.
then,
when
you
get
into
the
question
of
their
newspaper,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
made
guidance
in
the
cio
case
and
the
uaw
case
in
regard
to
some
things
that
you've
indicated
that
clearly
they
could
say
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
you've
also
indicated
that
they
couldn't
be
barred
by
--
constitutionally
because,
they
are
the
--
they
have
rights
to
be
heard,
they
have
rights
to
speak
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
but
i
meant
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
you
--
i
thought
you
had
gone
the
other
way
and
indicated
in
the
cio
case
that
they
have
a
right
to
express
themselves
in
their
newspapers
in
toward
--
to
their
own
members.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
inherent
in
your
opinion
was
the
proposition
that
there
is
something
the
states
couldn't
do
in
regard
to
the
rights
of
expression
by
the
majority.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
the
cio
case?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
this
case
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
a
state
has
the
power
to
strike
down
a
federal
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'm
bothered
by
the
word
state
action
in
--
you
don't
mean
by
that
governmental
action
but
you
mean
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
by
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
this
is
a
question
of
the
federal
constitution
and
what
can
be
--
a
person
can
be
compelled
to
do
under
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
even
as
to
that,
i
think
you
would
have
to
then
take
that
concept
and
the
legislative
history
and
history
of
the
unions
and
the
activity
and
apply
the
rights
under
the
constitution
to
that
problem
in
order
to
try
to
define
how
far
the
union
could
continue
to
go.
and
where
the
unions
might
have
been
perfectly
free
to
do
all
of
those
things
over
the
years
and
have
no
constitutional
problem
if
there
wasn't
compelled
membership
and
compelled
contribution
by
a
reason
of
the
agreement
under
the
statute.
the
united
states
takes
the
position
that
it
is
different
to
the
extent
of
the
dissenters
where
they
are
compelled.
and
there,
you
have
to
weigh
the
rights
of
the
majority
under
the
first
amendment
to
have
the
opportunity
to
express
themselves
and
the
rights
of
the
dissenters
not
to
be
crawled
in.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
but
the
first
amendment
does
provide
for
the
right
of
freedom
of
expression
for
both
groups.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
also
said
that
if
it
is
a
cover
for
compelling
to
an
ideological
agreement
that
that
question
was
reserved.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
don't
think
it's
--
i
didn't
consider
it
as
being
the
same
as
a
sham
or
device.
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
court
was
reaching
deeper
in
hanson
than
that
and
to
try
to
indicate
that
it
was
trouble
with
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
you
reserved
this
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
but
i'm
trying
to
point
out
that
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
you
made
it
clear
that
you
are
not
brushing
aside
the
rights
of
a
minority
if
they
were
forced
to
ideological
agreement
under
this
kind
--
this
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
my
concept
to
what
happened
in
hanson
except
i
was
trying
to
add
to
it
what
i
thought
was
a
gloss
that
you
did
show
a
recognition
of
this
kind
of
a
problem
but
said
it
wasn't
there.
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
indicated
in
hanson
that
you
felt
the
record
did
not
establish
some
of
the
assertions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
the
united
states
thinks
that
you'd
have
to
examine
the
extent
of
the
dissenters
and
those
who
joined
the
union
without
any
compulsion
which
whatsoever
which
we
don't
have
in
this
record.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
it
seemed
to
me
in
hanson,
you
limited
to
the
proposition
that
as
to
this
one
thing
whether
you
want
to
belong
to
a
union
shop
or
not,
you
can
be
compelled
if
they
make
an
agreement
under
the
statute
and
you
can
be
compelled
to
contribute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
the
--
your
concurrence
indicated
that
you
agreed
to
that
kind
of
an
approach
to
it.
now,
also
enhancement,
there
were
assertions
that
the
dissenters
were
being
required
to
go
along
or
agree
with
certain
action
and
ideologic
--
ideological
conformance.
and
that
question
the
court
reserved
and
we
think
that
is
in
this
case,
now
before
the
court.
and
that
you
did
not
enhance
to
decide
despite
the
fact
that
you
did
say
as
to
the
union
shop,
we
will
overrule
again
whether
you
like
it
or
not,
and
you
have
no
protection
for
that
under
the
first
amendment.
nevertheless,
we're
not
deciding
against
you
on
the
rest
of
the
things.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
here,
before
you,
you
have
the
question
of
how
much
of
the
other
things
involved
in
the
union
activity.
can
you
be
compelled
to
go
along
with
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
–
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
fact
--
the
reason
the
united
states
thinks
you
should
send
it
back
is
because
they
enjoined
all
payment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
a
different
question
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
only
reason
apply,
you
should
in
that
regard,
is
that
it
isn't
clear
from
the
records
of
the
extent
of
the
dissent.
you
see,
there
are
six
parties
before
the
court
here
in
a
representative
capacity.
how
many
of
these
represent
as
dissenters
is
not
revealed
by
this
record.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
except
for
a
further
problem
of
the
extent
of
the
effect
on
the
particular
parties.
the
record
doesn't
show
how
much
is
contributed
insofar
as
these
particular
appellees
are
concerned.
it
doesn't
--
of
their
$5
a
month
contribution
to
dues.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
might
say
that
it
wasn't
enough
for
the
court
to
act
because
it
was
so
small.
i
think
it
would
be
in
light
of
the
record
that
there
is,
it
could
be
less
than
that,
much
less
as
to
anyone,
and
it
may
be
that
there
are
as
25,
30%
of
them
that
are
dissenters
that
are
opposed
to
it.
it
might
be
that
there
are
only
a
number
--
on
your
two
hands
or
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
that's
a
different
problem.
so,
you
might
--
it
seems
to
me,
you
properly
want
to
see
what
the
extent
of
the
dissent
is
and
what
is
really
involved
before
you
would,
as
an
equity
court,
you
would
grant
such
a
decree.
if
there
was
two
cents
involved,
10
cents
or
something
like
that,
it
seems
to
me
you
might
say,
"well,
i'm
not
going
to
enjoin."
i'm
going
to
say,
"in
the
future,
the
union
can
account
for
its
funds
safety
and
not
spend
anymore
money
for
that
purpose
in
the
future."
now,
they
were
given
back
the
full
amount
of
their
contribution.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
some
of
these
activities,
certainly.
they
were
contemplated
in
hanson,
and
that
money
shouldn't
go
back
to
them.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black
except
for
the
problem
that
we
have
to
try
to
advise
you
where
to
draw
the
line
as
to
how
much
of
the
contribution
is
involved
in
the
unlawful
or
improper
expenditure.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
also
would
seem
to
me,
it's
involved
in
the
question
of
whether
an
equity
court
would
grant
any
relief
if
it's
de
minimis.
though
it's
so
small
that
you
wouldn't
be
bothered
with
it,
you'd
--
you'd
say,
well,
it
seems
if
it
was
two
cents
out
of
this
whole
picture,
it
would
be
quite
meaningless
and
a
court
might
say,
you
got
the
rights
but
it
isn't
enough
to
ask
the
chancellor
to
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
want
to
go
that
far
and
--
excuse
me.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
--
it
can
be
if
there's
compulsion
in
connection
with
it
to
contribute
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
can't
say
yes
to
that
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
are
substantial
amounts
but
they're
not
of
these
particular
appellees.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
something
that
they're
compelled
to
contribute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
take
the
basic
position
that
the
record
is
not
sufficient
for
the
court
at
this
time
to
decide
that
particular
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
do
you
include
in
that
that
the
49%
are
compelled
by
reason
of
the
statute
and
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
then,
we
would
treat
that
as
an
unconstitutional
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
because
that's
a
requirement
that
they
participate
in
a
political
position
that
is
opposed
to
their
own
with
their
own
funds.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
don't
think
the
record
develops
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
have
--
we
haven't
taken
that
--
that
position
in
the
brief.
but
it
is
the
government's
position
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
that
was
in
the
record,
then
it
would
be.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that's
one
of
the
reasons
we
tried
to
point
out.
but
this
record
is
not
complete
enough
for
you
to
act
because
the
--
for
instance,
there
is
farm
legislation
here.
now
that
seems
like
it's
quite
removed.
on
the
other
hand,
there
maybe
interest
that
the
union
could
demonstrate
for
their
--
that
it
has
a
direct
bearing
on
their
problem
of
being
germane
to
collective
bargain.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
was
trying
to
distinguish
and
i
may
not
have
made
it
clear
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
right
of
the
union
to
speak
which
there
is
under
the
first
amendment
on
behalf
of
its
position
and
that
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
many
areas.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
he
may
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
they
might
very
well
say
that
you
can't
use
my
money
for
those
purposes
but
you
can
use
all
the
rest
of
my
money.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
without
this
compulsion
of
the
statute,
there
isn't
any
question
of
what
they
would
be
subject
to
what
the
majority
had
provided.
it
would
be
a
voluntary
relationship
at
that
point.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
but
it
brings
in
another
factor
that
is
most
important
in
the
consideration
of
the
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
recall
anything
of
that
kind
of
judgment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
i
--
that
was
included
in
the
showing
this
problem
of
farm
legislation
as
well
as
contribution
to
unions
and
the
other
questions.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
thinks
there
is
a
distinct
difference
between
the
expenditure
of
this
money
and
the
collection
of
it.
it
adheres
to
the
position
that
i
tried
to
present
yesterday
that
the
statute
provides
for
the
payment
of
these
dues
under
a
contract
that
the
statute
permits
or
provides
for
and
that
the
--
it
is
contemplated,
implied
in
the
statute
that
those
dues
will
only
be
used
for
lawful
and
proper
purposes.
we
think
that
the
cases
cited
by
counsel
for
the
appellees
are
not
in
point.
where
they
say
that
there's
a
burden
upon
interstate
commerce
and
the
cases
that
they
refer
to
either
by
reason
of
a
licence
or
by
reason
of
a
tax.
and
there,
this
court
has
approved
an
injunction
against
that
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
because
it
--
the
collection
of
a
tax
itself,
is
unlawful.
this
case
is
entirely
different
from
that.
this
is
a
case
where
the
payment
of
the
funds
is
contemplated
to
be
lawful
in
all
respects.
and
it's
--
it
is
the
expenditure
that
can
be
questioned.
it
is
more
like
the
cases
where
a
state
has
the
power
to
tax
an
individual
under
the
general
tax
power
for
various
purposes.
and
the
tax
is
collected
and
then
misapplied
and
then,
you
can
enjoin
the
misapplication
under
various
state
constitutions
because
of
that
misapplication.
but
you
can't
keep
from
paying
the
tax.
you
can't
enjoin
the
collection
of
the
tax
and
we
think
that
is
the
distinction
in
this
situation.
furthermore,
the
united
states'
position,
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
no
constitutional
question
in
this
case
that
the
court
should
reach.
that
the
facts
are
not
so
developed
in
this
record,
that
those
questions
are
finally
presented
to
the
court
in
a
manner
that
you
need
them
and
that
you
require
in
--
under
your
cases
for
a
determination
of
constitutional
questions.
you
do
not
decide
constitutional
questions
until
they
are
both
right
and
they
have
to
be
decided
so
that
in
this
case,
the
--
a
decree
should
be
reversed
and
sent
down
--
sent
back
for
further
consideration.
now,
the
problem
that
i
have
--
i
think
i
can
illustrate
somewhat
from
the
record
in
regard
to
the
extent
of
these
expenditures.
the
questions
was
asked
to
me
in
regard
to
what
i
consider
a
peripheral
expenditure,
one
of
the
most
extreme
that
is
in
regard
to
direct
contributions
to
a
political
campaign,
the
activity
--
legislative
activities
and
many
of
those
and
the
maintenance
of
the
union,
all
of
those
the
united
states
think
are
generally
a
very
large
part,
would
be
perfectly
lawful
in
proper
expenditures
of
this
money
on
behalf
of
the
union
activity.
now
the
--
we
cannot
tell
from
this
record
whether
there
was
even
one
cent
contributed
to
this
particular
type
of
activity
and
it
certainly
shouldn't
be
passed
upon
by
this
court
as
a
constitutional
question,
unless
you
can
at
least
find
from
the
record
that
someone
contributed
at
least
one
cent.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
because
it
says
there
was
a
substantial
amount
for
all
of
these
various
purposes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't.
but
i
say
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
show
is
that
under
this
record,
it's
clear
that
a
substantial
amount
of
the
dues
were
spent
for
all
these
purposes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
but
i'm
saying
that
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
that
if
you
can
show
that
a
man
has
spent
say
$100
for
a
long
list
of
proper
expenditures
and
you
can't
tell
what
--
there's
some
part
of
that
$100
that
is
spent
for
an
unconstitutional
purpose,
but
you
can't
even
tell
whether
it
is
one
penny,
then
i
say
the
chances
were
does
not
rise.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
because
the
record
is
not
so
defined.
it
takes
in
the
stipulation
and
in
the
proof,
constantly,
a
substantial
portion
was
spent
for
all
of
these
things.
now,
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
you
can't
tell
how
much
and
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
case
was
tried
on
the
theory
that
all
of
these
things,
any
participation
in
legislation
that
was
under
their
definition,
not
germane
to
collective
bargaining
and
that's
a
very
tight
definition.
anything
that
was
not
within
that
classification
was
unconstitutional.
so
when
they
said,
under
the
findings
a
substantial
portion,
they
have
all
of
those
things.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
because
you
constantly
said
that
you
–
on
constitutional
issues
you
didn't
decide
them,
until
they
are
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
you
don't
decide
them
until
the
record
is
such
that
you
can
tell
what
you're
deciding.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
would
think
this
court
would
not
find
that
the
expenditure
of
a
fraction
of
a
cent
to
support
a
candidate
which
was
objected
to
by
a
very
small
minority
of
the
union,
maybe
these
six,
was
a
justification
of
holding
this
statute
be
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
was
applied
in
that
manner.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
certainly
would
not
close
down
the
church.
i
would
let
the
church
run
everything
else.
and
i
would
try
to
find
out
what
there
were
spending
for
that
was
bad
and
stop
just
that
little
tiny
part.
now
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
because
there
is
so
much
of
it
that
the
union
has
a
proper,
lawful
right
to
use
in
the
manner
that
they
did.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
you
shouldn't
stop
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
then
i
say
that
in
trying
to
develop
a
decree
that
would
take
care
of
your
problem,
which
i
can
see
is
a
serious
question
in
this
case.
nevertheless,
you
should
know
before
you'd
determine
that
that
statute
was
unconstitutional,
as
so
applied,
that
these
people
were
hurt
in
some
amount
and
be
able
to
see
what
it
is
and
all
the
facts
in
relation
to
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
stronger
case
that
i'm
trying
to
point
is
if
it
would
show
exactly
how
much
is
spent
for
the
purposes
that's
unlawful.
and
that
you
have
the
facts
before
you
as
to
the
justification
for
the
expenditure
in
this
particular
manner
that
the
parties
claim
was
unlawful.
so
you
could
examine
the
full
range
of
the
constitutional
question
of
how
that
first
amendment
right
was
affected
by
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
in
detail.
and
i
don't
think
that
any
chancellor
under
their
decisions
would
ordinarily
say,
if
there
was
one
cent
spent
unlawfully
and
99
cents
were
spent
lawfully,
that
you
would
stop
everything
and
give
the
general
injunction
or
you
would
even
reach
in
possibly
to
do
anything
about
that
amount
that
was
so
small
in
view
of
all
the
other
activities.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
recognize
that
view,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
mean,
mr.
justice
black
that
we're
trying
to
go
--
depart
from
the
stipulations
or
the
findings,
but
i'm
trying
to
show
the
limitations
in
those
findings.
and
that
they
don't
give
you
a
basis
for
constitutional
decisions.
