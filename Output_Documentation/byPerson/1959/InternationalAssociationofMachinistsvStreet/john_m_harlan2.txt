justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you,
at
some
point,
mr.
gambrell,
indicate
what
you
would
conceive
to
be
the
outside
constitutional
limits
on
the
use
of
dues?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
all
within
the
limits
of
--
that
that's
in
collective
bargaining
the
dues
could
be
used
for
such
purposes?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
specific
bargaining?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that
at?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
do
you
draw
the
line
on
your
premises?
where
do
you
draw
the
line
between
what
you
consider
to
be
unconstitutional,
because
evidently,
your
premise
is
on
the
theory
there
must
be
some
limit
as
to
the
right
of
the
union
to
use
these
funds?
where
do
you
draw
the
line
between
permissible
and
impermissible
expenditures?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
that's
already
been
determined
by
the
georgia
court
that
it
is
unconstitutional.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
what
--
what
point
is
there
in
sending
the
case
back
to
have
that
issue
litigated?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
being
too
as
i
understood
you,
you
think,
you
represent
the
government.
you
think
the
bar
as
forcing
a
man
to
pay
funds
to
support
candidate
that
he
is
against.
that
part
is
unconstitutional.
i
understood
you
to
say
it.
now
if
that's
true
that
opined
to
me
here
to
the
effect
that
the
people
wanted
to
overrule
to
compel
to
join
to
get
the
job.
the
money
was
used
to
support
political
candidates
that
they
were
literally
opposed.
how
could
we
send
that
back
if
only
that
phase
of
the
case
is
concerned
by
any
further
findings?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
should
send
it
back?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
--
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
that
the
decree
is
too
broad.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
if
the
decree
is
not
too
broad
in
certain
case,
as
applied
to
these
particular
union
number,
not
to
their
numerical
minority
and
majority,
but
if
the
decree
is
not
too
broad
with
reference
to
certain
of
these
members
who
paid
under
compulsion
when
they
don't
want
to,
why
should
we
send
it
back
--
reverse
the
whole
decree
and
upset
it
all
if,
to
that
extent,
it
is
supported.
maybe
we
should.
i
don't
understand
though
just
the
reason
why.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
are
findings
that
some
of
them,
certainly
there
are
findings
that
some
of
them
as
i
read
in
the
finding.
i
thought
they
are
rather
clear
and
specific.
some
of
them
belong
to
this
union
and
asked
to
join
to
get
a
job.
they
do
not
want
their
money
spent
for
candidates
that
they
are
against.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
as
to
them
if
the
constitution
forbids
compelling
them
to
pay
money
to
support
the
candidates
they
are
against,
would
they
not
be
entitled
relief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wanted
to
clear
my
mind
if
the
government's
underlying
position.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
government
takes
the
view
that
the
use
of
the
union
funds
to
support
local
political
candidate,
it
is
an
unconstitutional
use
of
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
know
on
this
record
and
that
georgia
court
has
so
held
that
the
substantial
amounts
of
these
funds
were
being
used
for
those
purposes.
now,
on
that
premise
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they're
of
the
general
funds
to
which
these
particular
appellees
presumably
have
contributed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
put
to
my
question
more
precisely.
supposing
it
was
shown
on
this
record
that
40%
of
the
union
member
--
well,
make
it
49%.
49%
of
the
union
membership
were
opposed
to
the
candidacy
of
a
particular
individual
to
whom
the
union
had
used
or
had
contributed
out
of
its
general
funds.
on
that
sort
of
a
showing,
does
the
government
take
the
position
that
that
would
be
an
unconstitutional
use
of
that
money?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
trying
to
put
my
question
as
directly
as
i
can
because
i
had
not
understood
you
the
way
you
answered
justice
black
with
regard
to
the
underlying
constitutional
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i'm
trying
to
make
a
specific
record
for
you
to
ask
to
ascertain
what
the
government's
position
is
in
the
hypothetical
record
that
i
give
to
you
as
49%
of
the
union
membership
is
opposed
to
the
candidacy
of
a
particular
individual
in
support
of
whose
candidacy
the
union
has
contributed
out
of
the
general
funds
of
the
union
to
which
the
49%
there
is
have
contributed
their
dues.
on
that
kind
of
a
record,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
that
would
be
an
unconstitutional
use
of
the
union
funds?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
certainly,
that's
what
we're
dealing
with.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
regard
that
as
unconstitutional?
that's
something
i
wanted
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
you
cleared
me
up.
i
thought
that
your
trouble,
basic
trouble,
was
that
you
found
the
record
was
inadequate
and
that
you
weren't
taking
the
position
on
the
constitutional
issue
but
now
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
is
the
position
of
the
government.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you?
do
you
claim
that
any
of
these
expenditures
violated
any
federal
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
you'd
agree
with
the
hanson
case
has
least
decided
this
much
that
it
was
not
unconstitutional
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
for
the
congress
to
coerce
in
the
hand
and
enjoining
the
union
as
the
price
of
keeping
his
job,
keeping
his
job
if
the
conditions
of
2,
eleventh
were
met
in
the
negotiation
of
the
bargaining
agreement.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
to
that
extent
that
the
court
did
hold
that
that
did
not
violate
the
associated
provisions
at
least
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
i
have
overstated
the
effect
of
hanson?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
they're
not
bona
fide
union?
justice
john
m.
harlan
for
a
moment,
supposing
a
substantial
minority
of
the
membership
didn't
like
the
particular
bargaining
representative
or
the
â€“
or
the
officer
of
the
union,
president
of
the
union,
could
his
money
be
constitutionally
used
to
pay
their
salary?
