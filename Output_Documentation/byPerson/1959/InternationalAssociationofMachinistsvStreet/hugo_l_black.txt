justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
conceded?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statement
that's
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
are
forced
to
pay
money
to
keep
that
job
to
advocate
ideas
that
they
are
against.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
make
any
difference
if
they
are
right
in
their
contention
as
what
kind
of
legislation
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
--
does
that
answer
these
questions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
raised
is
whether
you
can
afford
and
people
to
pay
money,
a
part
of
which
will
be
used
to
advocate
and
views
that
they
uphold
public
views
or
to
oppose
public
views
that
they
favor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
conceded,
is
that
--
that
this
case
does
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you
win
this
case,
is
that
your
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
it
mean
that
these
people
afford
to
hold
a
job,
in
order
to
hold
their
job
to
pay
money,
which
is
to
be
used
to
advocate
public
views
that
they
oppose
or
to
favor
public
views,
which
they
again
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
forced
to
leave
out
the
words,
public
views
that
have
to
do
with
legislation
that
have
--
have
to
do
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
with
social
policies,
it
has
to
do
with
problems
that
people
are
interested
in
as
citizens
and
as
members
of
society.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
you
were
to
use
this
for
some
purpose.
suppose
you
were
taking
it
and
using
it
for
some
purpose
that
the
union
ought
to
be
again.
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
your
view
--
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
union.
do
you
--
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
majority
of
union
members
have
a
right
to
decide
what
public
--
what
questions
relating
to
public
policy,
his
money
will
be
used
to
advocate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
used
in
part,
but
it
will
make
no
difference,
i
suppose,
as
i
recall
one
of
the
earliest
statements
was
that
if
even
a
penny's
worth
of
something
was
used
that
public
money
to
pay
a
tax
and
for
purpose
of
that
kind,
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
that
does
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
doesn't
settle
it,
because
that
doesn't
settle
that
he's
right
or
wrong
because
of
a
suit
that's
been
filed.
that's
not
been
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
come
up
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
relief
was
asked?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
ask
for
a
relief
to
an
injunction
to
bar
the
paying
and
accepting
of
money
to
be
used
for
this
purpose
without
attacking
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we're
talking
about
relief
is,
it
--
if
anyone
decides
to
renew
do
they
have
the
hold
that
whole
section
allowing
a
union
shop
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
your
claim,
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
you're
--
that's
your
complaint
here,
and
that
alone.
i
should
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
enjoined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you're
right
in
your
contention,
do
you
--
do
you
think
it
has
the
--
the
whole
act
has
to
be
declared,
that
section
has
to
be
declared
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
what
you're
--
i
understand
what
are
your
plans,
objective
is
paying
money
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
is
to
be
used
for
political
purposes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
the
relief
you
have.
but
just
you're
now
arguing
that
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
this
entire
section
would
be
held
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
--
would
you
particularly
asked
in
your
--
or
is
there
before
us
any
issue
that's
been
decided
or
is
it
raised
that
you
have
asked
to
enjoin
the
use
of
money
which
these
people
pay
for
political
purposes.
are
you
just
striking
at
the
whole
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
raise
the
other
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
heard
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
could
you
represent
anybody
that's
applied
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
don't
--
you
don't
claim
the
right
to
speak
for
them,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
--
the
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
reserved
in
a
--
both
the
concurring
opinion
and
the
court
opinion
in
the
hanson
a
question
that
would
come
up
if
someone
who
is
forced
pay
dues
to
be
used
politically
of
some
--
something
of
that
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they'd
bring
the
case
here.
but
you
are
asking
not
to
protect
the
people
who
are
--are
not
or
willing.
you're
asking
not
merely
to
protect
your
client
who
doesn't
want
to
pay
but
you're
asking
to
invalidate
the
law
so
that
people
who
want
to
pay,
pay
voluntarily.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
--
even
if
the
people
want
to
pay
voluntarily
to
the
fund
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
whose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whose
fundamental
rights?
they
have
a
right
to
their
rights,
too.
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
saying
that,
but
you
know
where
--
for
your
client.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
are
speaking
now
for
people
who
evidently,
do
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
want
voluntarily
to
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you're
not
--
you
have
limited
your
complaint,
however,
to
them.
you
haven't
sought
to
stop
these
particular
people,
protect
these
particular
people
from
paying
that
particular
money
on
account
of
the
fact
that
they
disagree.
you
are
seeking
to
invalidate
the
whole
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
that
decree
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
sustained
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
sustained
for
your
clients.
how
do
you
know
that
anybody
except
them
want
to
attack
this
law
on
the
ground
and
how
do
you
know
they
don't
want
pay
it
voluntarily?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
your
case
should
be
affirmed
--
your
client
--
your
actual
clients,
you'd
have
what
you're
after
and
do
what
you
want
is
to
protect
these
particular
working
men
whose
money
has
been
paid
out
that
they'd
spent
or
might
be
spent
for
purposes
that
they
don't
like.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
wanted
--
you
want
to
have
that
whole
act
and
say
it's
unconstitutional
even
though
it's
being
used
that
other
people
objected.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
so
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
could
happen
because
every
citizen
who's
claimed
his
constitutional
right
is
affected
--
can
protect
it
if
--
like
your
clients
have
done
a
decree
here
assuming
that
their
position
should
approved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
curtail
the
rights
of
anybody
or
your
client,
would
it?
to
give
them
their
money
back,
hold
that
they
are
entitled
to
their
money
back
because
we've
used
for
purpose
not
authorized
under
the
law.
that
wouldn't
curtail
the
rights
if
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
that
was
stipulated
and
each
one
had
an
interest
of
over
$3000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
--
what
happened
to
the
motion
to
remove?
justice
hugo
l.
black
remanded
by
consent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
if
you're
reading
that
to
show
us
that
we
decided
that
question?
i
--
i'm
asking
it
to
argue
that
we
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
did
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
think
that
caveat
was
put
in
to
both
of
the
court
opinion
and
the
concurred
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
think
--
what
is
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
challenging
any
of
the
findings
of
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
supreme
court
hold
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
to
accept
that,
don't
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
that
make
any
difference?
do
we
or
not
in
your
judgment
have
to
accept
the
statement
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
with
all
the
states,
so
long
this
is
all
they
announced.
this
doesn't
violate
the
federal
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
--
i
didn't
know
you
had
that
argument,
then
we
will
find
out
by
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
said
this,
"we
do
not
believe
one
in
constitution,
to
be
compelled
to
contribute
money,
to
support
ideas,
politics
and
candidates,
which
he
opposes."
they
then
said,
in
(inaudible)
that
the
union
while
expending
money
for
political
candidates,
politics,
they
are
saying
that
the
people
have
voted.
they
then
said
that,
"but
far
this
federal
law,
that
couldn't
be
done
because
georgia
forbade
it.
that
seems
to
me
your
issues
is,
which
i
think
you
will
get
to.
further,
"it
does
violate
the
constitution
to
--
for
the
government
to
pass
a
law
which
prevents
a
state
protecting
a
man
from
joining
some
organization
whereby
they
collect
his
money
and
use
it
for
candidacies
against
it."
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
say
it
was
a
comment.
i
thought
it
was
a
question,
to
see
if
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
can
get
the
question
that
we
have
before
us.
that's
what
this
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
it,
but
to
get
this
concrete,
as
it
can
be
more
concrete
than
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
made
it.
suppose
the
unions
after
a
man
--
he
had
to
join
the
union
to
get
a
job
by
reason
of
the
law
protecting
it,
by
congress,
will
decide
to
contribute,
to
have
their
fund
to
a
particular
change.
what
would
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
he
have
had
to
pay
that
dollar
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
he
have
had
to
pay
that
dollar
to
get
a
job
but
for
federal
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
know,
do
you
not
to
get
--
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
the
issue.
you
do
know
did
you
not
that
the
reason
--
that
the
union
could
make
this
closed
shop
agreement
whereby
this
man,
these
people,
could
not
get
a
job
unless
they
pay
dues,
but
because
the
federal
government
has
passed
an
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
reason
they
could
make
the
agreement
and
that's
the
reason,
but
for
that,
he
would
have
been
compelled
by
law,
would
he
to
pay
dues
to
the
union
in
order
to
get
a
job.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
seems
to
be
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
maybe
he
couldn't
get
the
dollar
back
but
would
you
have
to
pay
it
out
of
his
pocket?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
those
four
members
base
that
on
a
record
which
showed
that
the
union
--
and
the
raised
a
question
that
whether
a
union
could
constitutionally
talk
of
using
funds
that
it
had
gotten
from
people
who
compelled
to
join
the
union,
even
though
they
didn't
want
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
didn't'
have
any
trouble
with
that
so
long
as
the
government
didn't
have
this
law,
did
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
present
here
to
say
so?
i
am
using
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
statement
on
that
abstract.
i
think
that
is
abstract
in
this
case,
going
this
case
raises
the
question
to
whether
when
a
man
has
to
join
the
union
to
get
a
job,
and
he
has
to
join
because
the
federal
government
has
passed
the
law.
whether
they
can
take
the
money
that
he
has
to
pay
in
for
dues
and
use
it
to
support
candidacies
he
is
against?
it's
not
a
question
that
you
put.
of
course,
there
are
many
inducements
to
join
unions,
which
most
of
us
realize
and
appreciate
and
most
of
us
perhaps
believe
they
are
good,
but
that's
not
the
question
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
on
your
argument,
suppose
the
government,
congress
would
appropriate
$500,000
from
selected
democrat
or
republican
into
office,
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
declined
to
pay
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
--
that
particular
tax,
the
one
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
suppose
he
might
run
against
the
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
all
of
them
pay
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
both
kinds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
does
if
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
respect
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it's
just
a
dollar.
if
it
is
unconstitutional,
would
that
make
it
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
to
the
others,
they'd
be
volunteer
members,
would
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
no
complaint.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
that's
also
an
argument
against
the
scope
of
the
decree.
what
i'm
saying
is,
if
the
decree
is
too
broad
but
it's
supported
by
evidence
and
findings
on
a
basis
where
the
court
holds
its
constitution,
filed
with
the
remedy
in
that
instance
i
believe,
suppose
as
that
instance,
simply
to
the
court
to
decide
the
decree
be
conformed
to
what
is
the
law
under
the
facts
of
the
findings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
must
be
as
to
the
amount
that
they
got
back.
if
they
got
anything
back.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
a
very
famous
document,
it
was
indicated
that
even
a
penny
is
worth
that's
was
taken
away
under
the
constitution
for
the
bad
or
for
the
case
by
compulsion,
that
is
enough.
well,
i
don't
know
maybe
that
would
be
de
minimis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
--
that
was
rather
retarded.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
rankin,
have
you
read
the
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
maybe
wrong
but
of
course,
we
don't
want
to
decide
any
constitutional
question
we
don't
have
to.
was
there
anything
about
the
tva
in
it
or
farm
legislation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
judgment
enjoined
upon
the
fact
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
may
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
gambrell.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
no
--
nothing
to
do
with
that
except
on
the
basis
that
you're
claiming.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
whole
point
is,
they
don't
want
to
belong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
unconstitutional
or
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
those
unions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
thought
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
they
did
until
the
law
stepped
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
be
enough
--
it
might
be
enough
mr.
gambrell,
wouldn't
it,
if
we
decide
this
case?
what
you
have
is
the
case
where
the
court's
found
and
entered
than
judgment
in
the
effect
a
man
to
compel
to
belong
to
a
union
by
law,
the
dues
paid
for
political
campaign,
and
you
said
they're
against
it.
you
represent
that
–
those
eight
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
question
is
whether
that,
without
regard
to
marginal
cases
that
might
come
up,
whether
that
violates
constitution.
i
would
be
helpful
if
you
could
tell
me
what
good
it
would
do
to
send
that
point
that
to
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
that
help
pass
on
the
constitutional
question
as
to
whether
you
can
collect
people
--
amount
of
money
from
people
in
the
compulsion
of
law
and
then
use
it
to
support
certain
candidate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
anything
if
we
found
out
more
than
that?
i
think
the
unions
are
correct
in
there.
i
don't
see
that
should
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
judgment
is
too
much,
what
would
be
required
with
reference
to
that?
suppose
it's
too
much,
suppose
it's
more
than
they
should
have
gotten.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
assume
it's
more
than
they
could
got
--
should've
gotten.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
what
should
be
done
if
it's
too
much
so
far
as
that's
concerned,
that
piece
of
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it's
an
excessive
judgment,
what
should
be
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
respect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
that
regard
to
that,
the
judgment
is
excessive.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
remedy?
if
the
judgment
is
right
but
excessive,
what
is
the
remedy?
if
it's
wrong,
of
course,
it
should
just
be
reversed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
anyone
is
charging
that,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
state
must
argue
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
he
have
his
much
right
to
maintain
his
--
to
keep
--
refrain
from
paying
money
to
elect
candida
he
is
against
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
there's
no
profession
of
--
occupation
to
the
country
where
the
members
of
it
are
more
interested
in
politics
than
the
lawyers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
not
arguing,
are
you,
that
the
lawyers
have
anymore
rights
to
do
what
you
claim
was
done
here
than
the
labor
unions
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
--
how
do
say
that
in
the
face
of
the
findings
of
the
court
of
georgia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
it
says
that
they
found
that
they
were
constantly
doing
that.
the
union
admitted
it.
the
funds
were
used
for
that
purpose.
the
court
found
they
were
used
to
support
candidates.
are
you
saying
that
before
--
suppose
it's
unconstitutional,
are
you
saying
that
before
the
court
decides
that
a
man
is
being
deprived
of
his
constitutional
rights,
you've
got
to
trace
each
penny
that
he
pays
and
see
whether
that
particular
penny
went
through
channels
and
ultimately
was
spent
in
a
campaign?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
see
how
you
get
around
that
finding?
i
understand
how
you
can
argue
the
issue,
but
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
escape
the
finding
and
say
they
are
not
clear
insofar
as
the
issue
presented
is
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
that
include
the
purpose
that
they
say
is
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
does
it
make
then
as
to
whether
you
should
differentiate
between
those
if
they
point
out
it
here?
and
that's
the
finding
and
they
are
lead
it
deprives
them
of
a
constitutional
right,
why
are
they
not
entitled
to
a
remedy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
how
--
you
--
what
you're
saying
it
seems
to
me,
to
be
a
contradiction
in
turn.
you
say
that
the
$100
from
the
collective
funds
spent
for
some
legitimate
and
some
illegitimate
purposes,
that
maybe
here,
you
can't
find
that
there
was
one
penny
spent
for
the
illegitimate
purpose.
how
can
that
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
include
illegitimate
purposes
assuming
they're
illegitimate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what
--
what
difference
does
it
make
how
much?
if
the
money
is
spent
for
an
unconstitutional
purpose,
well,
why
are
they
not
entitled
to
have
a
decision?
and
why
should
it
be
hanging
far
on
the
basis
that
because
you
can't
tell
whether
it
was
$1
or
$50,
although
they're
able
to
find
and
see
if
anything
more,
but
what
--
why
should
that
deprive
a
person
to
the
right
to
have
his
constitutional
question
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
are,
suppose
some
of
them
are
more
legitimate
and
some
are
illegitimate.
suppose
some
of
them
as
you
say
peripheral
and
some
are
not,
it
still,
does
it
not,
includes
in
it
finding
if
they
have
spent
that
money,
taken
that
money
and
required
them
to
belong
to
the
union,
and
spent
their
money
to
advocate
views
that
they
do
not
favor.
now
suppose
some
of
it
relates
to
legislation
which
does
not
apply,
but
suppose
it
does
apply
and
suppose
they
have
no
more
right
to
spend
it
for
one
type
of
propaganda
legislation
and
another,
if
they're
against
it,
why
should
they
not
have
a
decision
on
this?
why
should
we
wait
when
the
issues
right
here
squarely
before
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
until
they're
presented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
we
can
tell,
can
we
not,
whether
we're
deciding
here
on
these
findings
and
do
we
not
have
to
decide,
whether
they
have
coerced
these
people
under
law
to
belong
to
a
union,
and
then
spent
a
part
of
the
money
which
they
contributed
out
of
the
collected
funds
for
the
purpose
of
advocating
views
they
are
against.
we
can
find
that
can't
be
necessary,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
an
inseparable
fund,
how
are
you
going
to
say
that
it's
just
a
fraction
of
one
percent?
would
you
say
that
people,
suppose
they
were
spending
that
money
for
church
matters,
the
church
to
which
they
were
opposed,
and
then
presented
the
same
thing,
would
you
say
that
these
people
must
wait
about
having
a
decision
until
they
could
find
out
how
many
dollars
of
their
money
went
into
the
fund
that
was
used
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
not
a
question
of
closing
down
the
church
or
the
--
or
the
other
thing.
that's
a
question
of
the
union
spending
the
money
and
assuming
that
it
gives
it
to
a
church
or
uses
it
for
political
purposes
and
the
record
show
this,
how
can
we
conscientiously,
say
if
we
--
if
it
is
our
duty
to
protect
constitutional
rights,
refuse
to
pass
on
it
when
it
instead
was
in
the
face,
merely
because
we
cannot
identify
each
particular
penny
that
went
to
each
particular
place.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
--
that's
the
end
of
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
should
not
include
a
prohibition
in
connection
with
that
which
the
court
finds
could
be
constitutionally
expended.
but
that's
a
different
--
that's
the
question
of
the
decree.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
do
we
have
to
send
back
to
find
this?
and
this
is
the
issue
they
raised.
they've
been
compelled
to
pay
dues
which
have
been
put
into
a
collective
fund,
a
part
of
which
the
union
admits,
doesn't
--
it
claims
it
has
the
right
to
do
it
and
maybe
it
has
-
i'm
not
now,
talking
about
its
eventual
determination
-
which
the
union
admits
being
used
for
the
election
or
the
seat
of
candidates
that
these
people
are
opposed
to,
and
they
have
that
(inaudible).
what
stronger
case
could
a
man
present
to
show
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
decision
than
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
be
small
to
you,
but
it
might
not
be
small
to
the
man
who
was
being
compelled
by
law
to
contribute
money
to
elect
candidates
that
he
violently
opposes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
question
is
here,
by
agreement
of
the
parties,
stipulation
of
the
parties.
they
have
agreed
that
the
money
had
been
collected
and
used
for
that
purpose
and
that
the
people
were
compelled
to
join
the
union.
and
the
government
now
comes
and
says
we
should
not
accept
that
stipulation
and
should
not
accept
the
findings
based
on
those
stipulations,
because
we
don't
know
just
how
much
of
the
money
was
spent
as
they
alleged
unconstitutional
--
unconstitutionally.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
you
leave
that
for
unconstitutional
purposes,
are
you
saying
that
there
has
been
no
coercion
that
required
people
to
join
--
to
join
the
union
and
pay
dues
against
their
consent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
stipulated
to
the
contrary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
stipulated
to
the
contrary,
did
you
not,
that
the
money
had
been
used
for
political
purposes
to
fund
--
out
of
which
this
fund
money
has
came
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
through
the
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying
is,
as
i
understand
it
there,
the
money
has
been
collected
from
them
by
compulsion
under
the
law.
that's
under
federal
law,
but
you
say
that
federal
law
is
not
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
the
issue
that's
presented
to
us,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
you
think
any
additional
facts
that
you
could
offer
or
they
could
offer
would
make
that
issue
any
clearer
than
it
is
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
means
too
broad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
may
i
ask
you
if
you
are
raising
that
question
here,
that
the
statute
does
permit
you
to
do
what
you
have
done
or
do
you
claim
that
the
statute
does
not
permit
you
to
do
what
you
have
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
exactly
what
it's
been
found
--
