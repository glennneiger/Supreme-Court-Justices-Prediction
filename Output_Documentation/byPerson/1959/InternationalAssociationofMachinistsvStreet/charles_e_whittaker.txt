mr.
gambrell
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please
to
make
sure
i'm
following
you.
are
you
arguing
now
that
the
hanson
case
was
wrongly
decided?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
understand
the
case
to
mention
the
subject.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i've
just
finished
rereading
it.
not
--
i
do
not
see
that
it
mentions
the
question
of
the
improper
or
proper
--
facts.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then
maybe
i
don't
understand.
i
thought
your
complaint
here
sought
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
--
of
2,
eleventh.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
limited
to
a
misuse
of
funds
but
the
enforcement
of
2,
eleventh,
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
court
had
held
in
hanson
that
2,
eleventh
was
constitutionally
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
valid
and
preempted
state
to
a
legislation,
and
now
you
say
you
don't
challenge
hanson
and
yet
you
say
that
you're
entitled
to
an
injunction
against
enforcing
the
2,
eleventh,
is
that
what
you
do?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
wouldn't
an
injunction
against
that
activity
on
the
basis
of
claim
to
legality
be
quite
a
different
thing
from
an
attack
upon
the
constitutionality
of
2,
eleventh?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
gambrell
may
i
ask
you
this
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
suppose
i
have
100%
agreed
to
what
you
say
here.
suppose
i
--
that
just
for
example
i
went
with
this.
would
i
yet
be
able
to
sustain
this
judgment
which
appears
in
the
record
101
and
continues
through
the
other
pages
of
105
and
106?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
no,
i'm
speaking
of
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
of
the
georgia
decision
that
read
in
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
105
and
106.
suppose
i
agree
with
every
word
you
just
said,
could
i
then
yet
sustain
this
georgia
judgment
which
says
that
the
statute
2,
eleventh
11
is
unconstitutional
and
it's
void
and
it
--
its
operation
in
effect
is
enjoined
and
it's
not
limited
to
an
injunction
against
use
of
funds
or
what
you
say
as
to
proper
terms.
now
i
wonder
what
your
answer
is,
could
i,
if
i'm
100%
wanted
to
do
so,
could
i
sustain
this
judgment
at
your
basis?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
know
what
that
means,
now.
would
that
pleadings
that
say
it's
unconstitutional,
now
you
say
we
want
whatever
we
can
get.
i
--
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
remanded
by
the
court
upon
themselves.
