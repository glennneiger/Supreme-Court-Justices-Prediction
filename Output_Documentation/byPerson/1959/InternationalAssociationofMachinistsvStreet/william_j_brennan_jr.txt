mr.
schoene,
was
that
amendment,
was
it
not
actually
in
language
taken
from
the
opinion
of
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
the
--
what
--
what
in
the
court's
opinion
says
anything
like
that?
i
didn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
--
this
is
no
such
thought
as
that
in
the
--
in
the
opinion
below.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
--
they
concede
as
i
read
their
opinion
that
the
railway
labor
act
as
amended
is
paramount.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
they
proceed
to
hold
that
as
certain
aspects
as
--
as
here
applied,
are
unconstitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
the
supreme
court
of
georgia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
theory
of
course
is
that
they're
forced
here
not
to
listen
but
to
speak,
to
speak
to
--
that
their
money
is
taken
from
them,
compelled
--
compulsorily
and
in
order
to
support
speech
in
which
they
do
not
believe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
in
which
they
disagree
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
certainly
it's,
something
more
than
superficial,
a
comparison
between
those
who
are
forced
to
listen
and
those
who
were
forced
to
speak.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
part
--
it's
a
part
with
their
money,
part
of
which
is
used
to
promote
ideas
and
--
in
which
they
do
not
believe
and
with
which
they
do
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
kramer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
an
element
in
this
case
of
the
use
of
some
of
these
funds
to
support
candidacies
of
particular
candidates,
who
some
of
these
plaintiffs
might
oppose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
is
there
such
element?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
it

what's
that?
justice

j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
