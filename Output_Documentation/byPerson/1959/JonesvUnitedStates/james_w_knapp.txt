mr.
james
w.
knapp
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
understood
counsel
to
remark
that
the
government
had
treated
this
case
as
though
the
prosecution
admitted
the
warrant
was
unlawful.
if
he
did
say
that
--
in
that
--
in
my
understanding
of
it,
i'm
sure
that
it
is
not
correct.
that
has
never
been
the
government's
position.
the
government's
position
in
the
trial
court
was
simply
this
that
the
defendant
did
not
have
any
standing
to
raise
the
question
of
the
illegality
of
the
warrant.
and
that
since
the
trial
--
motion's
trial
judge
held
that
no
--
there
was
no
standing,
he
never
reached
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
warrant
was
valid.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
we
think,
must
have
at
least
considered
that
the
warrant
was
valid
because
it
went
on
to
discuss
the
execution
point,
and
that's
the
only
basis,
and
i
think
you'll
find
it
in
our
brief
at
page
35
of
our
belief
that
perhaps
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
consider
the
validity
of
the
warrant
and
consider
it
valid.
however,
they
made
no
mentioned
of
it
and
it
isn't
explicit
in
that
court's
opinion.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
try
to
get
this
case,
the
perspective
of
this
case
back
to
the
way
the
case
was
tried
at
the
trial
level.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
position
was
consistent
to
the
parties.
the
government
--
the
defendant
first
filed
his
pro
se
motion
to
dismiss
in
which
it
was
discussed
here
before
in
which
if
the
defendant
did
not
deny
possession
of
the
narcotics
and
if
he
did
not
deny
having
made
such
use
of
the
premises
as
to
charge
him
with
notice
and
knowledge
of
what
the
premises
contain,
he
certainly
did
his
best
to
convey
that.
and
certainly,
any
prosecutor
reading
it
would
understand
that
this
man
is
saying,
“you
haven't
proved
possession
and
i'm
not
admitting
it.”
now,
he
comes
forth
with
his
motion
to
suppress
filed
by
counsel,
the
counsel
who
was
argued
the
jeffers
case
here,
a
very
able
attorney.
and
he
made
no
mention
of
any
standing.
his
motion
was
based
on
the
face
of
the
warrant.
find
it
was
invalid
because
it
had,
in
effect,
been
obtained
through
hearsay.
at
the
hearing
on
that
motion,
the
government
raised
the
point
with
the
motion's
judge,
judge
laws
and
said,
“the
defendant
has
not
shown
that
he
has
standing
here
to
raise
the
question
as
to
the
illegality
of
the
search.”
at
that
point,
without
anything
further,
the
defense
lawyer
didn't
say,
"well,
i
don't
have
to
prove
standing”
or
“i
can
rely
on
the
government's
allegations
in
its
indictment
or
in
its
--
in
its
warrant
or
in
its
application
for
a
warrant.”
he
said,
“i
asked
leave
to
a
man
to
show
that
the
defendant
was
present
at
the
time
on
the
premises
at
the
time
in
question
as
an
invitee
or
guest,"
so
he
immediately
came
up.
his
--
his
permission
to
a
man
was
allowed.
he
is
the
attorney
endorsed
on
the
motion.
and
then
he
proceeded
to
put
the
defendant
on
the
stand,
and
he
was
very
particular
that
he
did
not
want
the
defendant
question
by
the
government
as
to
innocence
or
guilt.
then
he
went
right
to
the
question
of
what
right
he
had
to
be
in
the
premises.
and
i
believe
that
the
defendant
testified.
he
said,
“whose
place
was
it?
did
you
rent
it?
did
you
pay
rent
or
own
it
or
anything?”
he
said,
“he
was
evans,
arthur's
place.”
mr.
james
w.
knapp
this
is
page
24
of
the
record,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i'm
addressing
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i'm
raising
the
--
the
--
right
now,
as
i
understand
that
the
defendant
has
abandoned
the
argument
that
--
that
he
does
not
have
to
show
stand
or
at
least
has
abandoned
it
to
a
great
extent.
but
what
i
was
trying
to
do
is
to
set
the
--
the
factual
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
picture
rather
than
--
as
to
the
broad
scope
of
the
entire
case,
rather
than
as
to
any
particular
point,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i'm
sorry.
but
he
said,
"was
he
a
friend
of
yours?"
"yes,
sir."
did
he
give
you
the
use
of
that
apartment
in
any
manner?"
"he
did."
"did
he
give
you
a
key?"
"he
let
me
have
a
key."
now,
that
was
the
extent
of
his
direct
testimony
in
--
on
cross-examination.
now,
the
government
is
asking,
“is
it
not
a
fact,
sir,
that
you
had
your
clothing
and
your
personal
property
in
these
premises
on
the
date
that
you
are
arrested
there?”
"i
had
a
suit
there."
"one
suit?"
"and
your
shirt?"
"a
suit
and
a
shirt."
"and
other
clothing
that
you
have
there?"
"shoes
and
stocking
that
i
had
on.
i
didn't
have
anything
on."
i
understand
this
to
mean
certainly
taking
in
the
context
of
his
testimony
at
the
trial
where
he
testified
on
page
60.
"isn't
it
a
fact
that
you
had
your
clothes
in
this
apartment
on
august
21?"
this
is
on
cross-examination.
answer,
"that
i
had
to
put
on."
i
understand
that
what
he
meant
is
that
he
had
a
clothes
he
had
their
in
the
apartment
was
the
clothes
that
he
physically
had
on
his
body
and
that
he
had
nothing
else
there.
then
on
cross-examination,
the
government
went
on
and
developed
that
he
lived
with
his
parents
at
811
9th
street
northeast
and
that
he
read
it
from
them
and
that
was
his
home.
now,
that's
consistent
with
what
he
said
in
his
motion
to
dismiss.
and
this
defendant
at
the
trial
when
he
came
to
testify
on
his
own
behalf
didn't
change
his
testimony
any.
it
was
still
the
same
thing.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
asked,
“now,
isn't
a
fact
you
tell
the
police
officer
that
the
apartment
belonged
to
mr.
evans
who
had
gone
to
philadelphia
and
he
was
allowing
you
to
stay
in
his
apartment?”
answer,
“he
didn't
allow
me
to
stay
in
the
apartment,
sir.”
“he
had
a
key?”
“yes,
sir.”
mr.
james
w.
knapp
he
also
testified
that
he
hadn't
slept
there
a
night
before.
excuse
me,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i'm
on
page
60
and
61.
that
he
--
that
he
had
not
spent
there
the
night
before,
that
he
arrived
around
4:30
or
maybe
5
o'
clock.
and
that
he
came
there
to
get
earline
richardson.
"where
there
--
where,"
in
--
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
he
asked,
“where
all
these
other
people
already
there?”
“yes,
sir,
they
were
there.”
“you
knew
all
these
other
people,
didn't
you?”
“no,
not
personally,
sir.”
i
believe
that
somewhere
else
he
testified
over
on
the
top
of
page
60
that
they
were
in
the
apartment
when
he
came
there,
that
the
only
one
he
knew
personally
was
a
man
named
cicero
martin.
so
you
had
earline
richardson
and
cicero
martin
and
about
three
or
four
others
that
he
didn't
even
know
that
were
in
this
apartment.
so
--
and
he
testified
too
on
his
own
behalf,
on
record
page
59
and
over
on
page
--
that
he
did
not
possess
the
narcotic
pill
which
was
found.
he
was
very
definite
that
he
didn't
put
the
pill
in
the
awning
or
in
the
bird's
nest,
that
the
paraphernalia
was
not
his,
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it.
so
thus,
you
have
here
a
defendant
who
has
consistently
taken
the
position
that
he
did
not
possess
the
narcotics
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
consistent
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
your
honor,
the
government
has
consistently
taken
the
position
that
he
did
possess.
and
in
fact,
his
counsel
pointed
out,
we
could
not
prevail
here
unless
the
jury
did
believe
that
question.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
if
your
honor
please,
here
it
is.
if
he
possesses
the
property,
if
it
is,
he
is
and
he
claims
it,
then
he
has
no
right
to
get
up
and
lie
and
say
that
i
didn't
have
possession
of
it.
so,
if
you're
giving
that
right,
you're
giving
in
two
strings
to
the
bow.
he
can
sit
here
and
say,
“one
thing,
i
--
the
--
the
search
is
illegal.”
and
at
the
same
time,
he
can
turn
around
and
say,
“well,
i
didn't
know
there
was
anybody.”
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
under
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
sir.
he's
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
correct.
he
has
that
right
to
say
nothing.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
if
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
if
he
had
come
here.
and
at
the
end
of
the
government's
evidence
had
said,
“i
will
stand
on
that
evidence,”
i
think
maybe
then
the
court
might
have
had
some
problem
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
to
go
there.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
yes,
sir.
i
think
he
is.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
think
we're
into
that
circle
that
judge
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
whittaker.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
--
pardon
me,
exactly
true.
there
are
--
if
he
came
--
if
he
comes
to
claim
the
right,
he
has
to
be
a
person
entitled
to
claimant.
and
it's
clear
that
this
privilege
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
a
privilege
of
this
person.
this
court
has
said
so
in
several
cases.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
was
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
we
--
we
have
no
right
to
take
it.
we
have
no
right
to
use
it
if
it
is
his
or
if
he
has
some
interest
in
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
fifth
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
--
the
fourth
amendment,
as
we
understand
it
and
as
all
of
the
courts
of
appeal
and
as
this
court
has
held
and
it's
stated
in
cases,
is
a
personal
right.
it's
a
personal
right
of
the
individual.
it's
his
right
to
privacy.
he
hasn't
any
right
to
complain
about
the
invasion
of
someone
else's
right
to
privacy.
and
that's
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
it's
true.
we
did
get
off
from
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
exactly,
your
honor,
there's
--
there's
no
doubt
about,
and
the
point
is
where.
and
--
and
we
say
here
that
it's
--
he
is
affirmatively
challenging.
he
is
the
one
who
is
--
he
has
what
is
known
among
the
lawyers
as
the
fighting
motion.
it's
his
duty
to
fight
it.
it's
his
duty
to
show
that
he
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
constitutional
protection
and
he
has
to
do
it.
now,
everywhere
somewhere
on
--
along
the
line
in
the
lawsuit,
somebody
has
to
make
a
decision
whether
to
use
evidence,
what
to
do.
it's
true
that
in
this
case
maybe
a
possibility,
the
only
way
he
could
do
it
would
to
be
make
a
motion,
an
affidavit
himself
saying
that
he
did
have
possession.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
certainly.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
certainly
yes,
sir,
if
he
stands
new.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
the
government
is
going
to
prove
that
when
it
proves
the
case
of
course.
but
he
has
to
--
i
say
he
has
to
either
adopt
the
government's
proof
which
he
did
not
do
here
in
respect.
he
specifically
denied
it.
he
--
he
couldn't
do
it.
he
couldn't
do
it
ethically
or
honorably.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
he
--
he
could
have
--
he
could
have
stood
pass
but
he
didn't
seek
to
do
it.
that
was
not
the
nature
of
his
defense.
he
elected
to
put
in
the
general
issue
and
to
fight
it
out
along
that
line
that
i
didn't
own
the
narcotics.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
we
said
he
did.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
if
--
in
--
on
his
position,
he
could
not
claim
the
right
to
suppress
it
because
he
had
no
standing
unless
he
could
bring
himself
within
the
standing
rule
by
this
very
--
this
testimony
that
he
had
been
given
the
use
of
the
premises
and
the
key.
now,
of
course
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
they
were
consistent
with
his
defense.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
somewhat
that
because
i
don't
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
don't
think
we
were
trying
to
stop
him,
but
we
were
trying
to
make
him
elect
what
defense
he
had.
he
had
two
defenses.
and
to
some
extent,
they
would
be
inconsistent
and
he
couldn't
make
both
of
them
honorably.
he
couldn't
say,
“these
are
my
narcotics,”
and
then
come
onto
trial
and
say
they
are.
i
mean
he's
lying
somewhat.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
pardon
me,
your
honor.
as
he
pointed
out,
the
circuit
court
cases,
those
that
we
have
found,
do
say
that
any
admission
that
he
makes
certainly
through
testimony
could
be
used
against
him.
that
point
is
not
here.
it's
not
in
this
case
because
it
was
not
done
and
on
his
theory
of
defense,
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
do
it
and
--
and
nothing
that
he
did
here
was
used
against
him.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
point
has
to
be
decided
as
to
whether
or
not
such
a
thing
should
be
useable
by
the
government,
it
should
come
before
this
court
in
a
case
where
it
has
the
specific
factual
situation
and
not
in
a
generality
point.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
it
--
it
might
well
be.
i
--
i
don't
want
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
think
he
would
have
to
come
and
--
and
show
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
let
me
point
out
here.
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean,
as
far
as
standing,
that
he
would
have
to
get
up
there
and
make
an
admission.
i
think
in
this
case,
he
could
have
proved
standing
without
bearing
the
government
officers.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
he
wouldn't
have
to
testify
here,
i
don't
think.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
have
amounted
to
a
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
if
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
without
a
reason
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
is
a
special
motion
that
we're
deciding
in
preliminary
in
a
--
in
a
corollary
matter.
and
that
the
--
it
isn't
until
all
the
--
the
case
is
finally
tried
before
a
jury
that
you
--
the
jury
decides
the
ultimate
question
here
of
whether
the
government
has
proved
it
perhaps.
i
don't
understand
this,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
if
--
if
that
would
be
true,
your
honor,
we
should
take
that
that
venue
would
have
to
have
on
the
preliminary
motion
of
this
character
even
in
effect
have
a
complete
trial
of
the
issue.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
would
--
i
don't
believe
so
because
i
think
it's
up
to
him
to
allege
it.
it's
up
to
him
to
show
it,
not
the
government
to
show
that
he
didn't
have
it.
i
think
it's
up
for
him
to
show
that
he
did,
that
he
brings
himself
within
the
ambit
of
the
constitutional
protection.
i
think
it's
up
to
him
to
do
it.
the
case
is
so
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
have
looked
and
read
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief
and
--
except
for
the
--
i
believe
it
is
the
dean
case
which
is
a
district
court
case
which
was
cited
as
being
against
us.
the
general
proposition
in
the
circuit
courts
is
--
does
not
make
any
distinction
as
to
whether
this
is
a
possessory
case
or
not.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
a
number
cases
that
i
ran
across,
perhaps
six
or
eight
of
them
in
which
they
find
that
the
man
had
no
standing
but
nevertheless
find
it
from
the
evidence
at
the
trial
that
he
had
possession
and
they
convict
him
on
it
and
so,
it's
not
unusual.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no,
sir,
we
should
not
make
that
distinction
because
as
i
say
again
it's
--
the
constitutional
privilege
is
a
personal
right,
a
personal
privilege
and
it's
up
to
the
defendant
to
bring
himself
within
it.
if
he
brings
himself
within
it,
then
he
has
the
standing
required
and
the
question
goes
on.
now,
if
you're
going
to
allow
then
to
--
to
go
look
at
where
this
thing
will
finally
lined
up,
let's
see
where
we're
going
to
get
to
eventually.
and
eventually,
we'll
come
to
a
position
and
some
will
come
here
and
say,
“we
don't
need
any
standing
at
all.”
and
then,
you're
going
to
have
cases
where
the
government
may
--
i
can
imagine
one
readily
where
the
police
learn
of
a
shooting
or
a
holdup
and
they
hear
that
the
gun
is
in
a
certain
house
and
they
get
a
warrant
and
they
go
there
and
so
--
we'll
say
it's
a's
house.
they
come
in
a
and
b
there
and
there's
the
gun.
and
he
says,
“yes,
it's
my
gun.
sure
it's
my
gun.
but
i
love
it
to
be,
he's
just
returned
it.
well,
wait
a
minute.
i
didn't
commit
this
crime.
i
can
prove
that
i
was
in
another
place."
he
is
not
in
quite
out
but
--
and
as
a
result,
a
is
a
witness.
it's
a's
home.
it's
a's
gun.
would
you
let
b
claim
that
the
search
and
seizure
of
a's
home
for
a's
gun
was
illegal?
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
would
it
make
any
difference
if
one
of
the
charges
whether
he
had
unlawfully
possessed
a
firearm
because
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
it
would
be
an
unlawful
possession
of
a
firearm
along
with
a
--
assault
of
charge.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
oh,
yes
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
very
definitely
the
question
of
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that
at
this
point
if
--
if
we've
exhausted
the
other
subject.
question
of
whether
or
not
on
the
fact
shown
by
him
that
he
had
the
right
to
use
the
apartment
and
the
key
to
it,
on
that
question
as
counsel
points
out
the
cases
go
different
ways.
they
--
second
circuit
cases
seem
to
make
it
depend
upon
whether
the
person
who
was
the
guest
was
dwelling
in
the
premises.
they
have
the
employees
who
are
rightfully
on
the
premises
even
though
they
might
have
some
custody
of
the
premises
generally
held
it's
not
having
standing
to
object
to
--
to
searches
of
the
premises.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
cases
generally
hold
that
he
has
to
have
some
possessory
or
proprietary
interest
and
these
are
the
premises
or
the
things
seized
in
order
to
have
standing,
although
it
doesn't
--
you
--
you'll
find
cases
where
he
certainly
had
less
than
--
than
that.
there
are
some
cases
such
as
the
automobile
case
that
he
ment.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
thing
we're
after,
the
thing
we
have
to
look
at
is
what
are
we
trying
to
protect?
what
right
is
the
man's
right
to
privacy?
it's
his
right
to
have
a
place,
a
home
where
he's
free
from
invasion
by
others.
and
if
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
the
use
to
which
he
puts
that
place.
and
this
man
made
no
such
use
of
these
premises.
he
didn't
live
in
them.
he
didn't
sleep
there
except
maybe
a
night
as
he
testified.
he
didn't
have
his
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
would
not
think
that
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
you
would
have
standing
because
it's
not
a
place
that
you
treat
as
your
own.
it's
your
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
place
where
you'll
take
your
own
private
possession,
a
place
where
you
put
your
things
and
have
a
right
to
feel
that,
“this
is
mine
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
and
no
one
else
dare
to
come
in
here.”
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
kind
of
privacy
that
this
--
that
the
--
the
constitution
intends
to
protect.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
it's
the
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
because
there,
all
he
has
physically
is
his
presence,
is
his
person
there
and
whatever
he
may
have
on
him.
the
other
way,
it's
--
as
i
think
it
was
this
constitution
that
designed
this
to
protect
the
people
in
their
homes
and
their
houses
and
in
their
personal
effect.
but
certainly
not
to
--
to
protect
someone
who
might
be
in
someone
else's
apartment
or
someone
else's
home.
so,
i
think
that
--
i
mean
that's
we
argue
before
that
here,
he
did
not
make
such
use
of
these
premises
as
would
entitle
him
to
the
protection
of
the
--
of
the
--
at
home.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
don't
believe
it
would.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
--
i
don't
think
it
would,
sir.
i
don't
think
it
should.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no,
sir,
i
do
not
think
that
it
should.
i
think
it
--
that
--
if
you
had
made
some
new
cell,
it
is
to
keeping
as
your
own.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
you
kept
none
of
your
possessions
there.
if
you
had,
that
would
have
been
a
different
proposition.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
oh,
i
think
that
would
make
us
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
think
that
you
have
to
--
to
break
some
place
if
you
would
think
that
you
have
control
over
it,
that
you
even
feel
that
you
have
a
custody
of
your
things,
your
private
effects.
many
of
the
people
have
--
as
you've
described
it
as
a
hideout,
but
there
--
certainly
there
is
a
nature
of
human
dealings
is
--
is
such
that
i
know
personally.
my
dad
goes
away,
gives
me
the
key
to
his
house
and
said,
“jim,
you
can
use
it
anytime
you
want
to.”
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
i
don't
go
over
there
and
sleep
and
move
in,
but
if
i
did,
i
think
i
would
be
protected
but
when
i
don't,
if
i
just
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no,
sir,
i'll
be
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
don't
believe
that
he
would
under
those
circumstances.
i
think
i
have
not
made
such
sufficient
use
for
the
purpose.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
oh,
yes.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
they
--
they
do
in
effect
go
into
that
in
determining
these
questions.
if
we
read
these
cases,
you'll
find
that
they
go
into
--
to
what
the
man's
right
of
the
place
was.
did
he
lease
to
someone
else?
and
if
they
go
into
it
in
some
detail,
so
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
that's
a
--
naturally,
in
the
thing
of
this
type,
we're
going
to
have
a
great
variety
of
situations
and
there's
a
question
of
where
to
draw
the
line.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
of
course,
the
fourth
amendment
is
--
is
put
there
for
the
protection
of
the
people
and
we're
not
trying
to
--
to
whittle
it
down.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
circuit
courts
seem
to
be
even
stronger.
they
seem
to
hold
that
he
has
to
have
some
proprietary
of
possessory
interest
in
the
property.
and
there
was
one
case,
i
recall
--
i
don't
recall
the
name
but
it's
in
our
brief
where
--
where
the
man
owned
a
house,
he
had
leased
our
house
back
of
it,
but
he
lives
with
his
father.
and
they
held
that
in
that
case,
the
liquor
that
was
found
in
the
premises
which
he
said
he
leased
that
he
had
no
standing
even
though
he
was
in
fact
owner
of
them.
and
there
had
been
case
after
case
where
the
man
owned
it
and
leased
it
to
someone
else
and
they
said
he
has
no
standing
because
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
use
it.
i
would
like
to
say
this
that
we
claimed
that
he
may
not
stand
on
the
government's
proof
because
of
the
position
that
he
took
and
consistently
maintained
at
the
trial
here.
we
claimed
that
he
must
show
some
right
was
violated
since
the
privilege
of
the
amendment
is
personal.
we
assert
that
the
interest
he
has
shown
is
not
sufficient
because
he
was
not
using
the
places,
the
place
of
abode
or
a
place
to
keep
his
private
effects.
but,
even
if
it
should
be
held
that
he
had
standing
here,
under
the
circumstances,
we
do
not
believe
that
it
avails
him
of
anything
because
it
is
our
position
that
the
warrant
was
good.
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that
point,
your
honors,
unless
you
have
further
questions
on
the
standing
issue.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
are
you
referring
to
the
--
are
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
--
sorry,
i
didn't
read
that.
were
you
referring
to
the
question
of
sanctions?
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
as
--
as
i
--
i
believe
that
i
have
answered
part
of
that,
your
honor,
through
my
argument
that
the
constitutional
privilege
is
a
privilege
personal.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
right
is
personal
in
which
--
for
that
reason,
he
has
to
be
personally
asserted
that
it's
a
personal
right.
and
the
--
the
rule
which
suppresses
the
evidence
as
i
understand
is
--
is
a
judicial
rule
made
to
implement
and
to
--
to
carry
out
the
protection
that's
remedial.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
it
gives
the
man
a
remedy
if
he's
been
wrong
and
it
won't
let
the
government
heard
these
issues
of
having
obtained
something
illegal.
but
it
does
and
of
course,
tend
to
impose
sanctions
on
the
officer
but
the
question
is
--
on
this
question
of
sanction
is,
“should
we
have
sanctions
here?”
it's
all
right
to
have
sanctions.
one
is
going
to
do
some
good.
but
here,
we
don't
have
a
gross,
wrongful,
deliberate
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
if
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
don't
think
it's
personal
if
it's
somebody
else's
--
if
the
--
if
the
injury
was
to
someone
else.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
if
a
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
why
should
a
person
charged
with
a
crime
who
has
not
had
any
of
his
own
rights
invaded
be
able
to
suppress
the
evidence
which
--
because
it's
been
an
invasion
someone
else's
right.
take
the
case
of
a
and
b
that
i
gave
to
you.
he
might
very
well
be
in
sense
that
a
might
very
well
be
in
sense
that
b
had
used
his
gun
to
commit
an
offense.
it
might
be
a
willing
witness,
would
have
no
objection
at
all
to
the
police
had
been
broken
into
his
place
even
grossly.
why
should
b
be
able
to
stand
on
some
invasion
of
a's
rights?
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
sir.
i
assume
that
it
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
if
--
if
the
search
warrant
is
invalid,
it's
--
it's
valid
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
oh,
you
mean
the
--
the
--
you're
talking
not
to
the
third
point?
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
if
the
search
warrants
were
not
valid
and
the
things
were
all
new
personally
and
the
invasion
to
your
person,
i
should
think
then,
of
course,
you
would
have
standing.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
papers
if
they
were
yours,
i
think
would
be
the
jeffers
case
makes
that
clear,
your
honor,
if
they're
your
papers,
if
they're
your
papers.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
if
it's
your
papers.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
then
you
--
well,
he
didn't
see,
says
they're
not
his
narcotics.
he's
always
said
that.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
he
says,
“you
have
no
business
to
take
them,"
but
he
makes
that
standing
dependent
upon
his
use
of
the
premises,
not
upon
his
ownership
as
a
narcotics.
he
always
said,
he's
never
--
he
always
said,
“i
--
i
don't
know
any
of
these
narcotics.”
but
if
you
get
to
the
point
relative
to
the
warrant,
we
contend
that
the
warrant
was
a
valid
warrant.
the
information
was
received
from
a
source
which
had
given
information
to
the
affiant
on
previous
occasions
in
which
was
correct.
i'll
agree
that
the
word
"previous
occasion"
is
susceptible
of
two
meanings.
it
could
mean
one
occasion.
it
could
mean
more
than
one.
but
at
least,
it
--
the
--
on
its
face,
the
warrant
showed
that
the
information
came
from
someone
who
had
previously
given
information
which
was
correct.
now,
he
said,
“why
didn't
the
officer
use
word
reliability
or
previous
reliable?”
well,
of
course,
he
might
then
turn
around
and
say,
“well,
he's
just
stating
a
conclusion."
here,
he's
stating
a
fact
whether
or
not
a
person
has
previously
found
to
be
reliable
might
be
considered
a
conclusion.
and
i
have
no
doubt
if
someone
opposite
circumstance
could
so
argue.
but
--
then
let's
see
what
the
information
was.
the
information
was
detailed.
it
was
detailed
that
the
petitioner
and
earline
richardson
were
involved
in
illicit
narcotic
traffic,
that
they
kept
a
ready
supply
of
heroin
in
what
they
had
at
that
apartment.
the
apartment
was
designated
by
street
number
and
by
apartment
number.
it
said,
"where
the
narcotics
were
kept?
under
a
pillow,
on
the
person,
on
a
dresser
or
on
a
window
ledge?”
that's
pretty
specific
information.
he
said
that
the
search
that
the
source
of
information
had
made
purchases
at
the
apartment
on
many
occasions
the
last
time
was
august
20,
which
was
the
day
before
the
warrant
was
obtained.
it's
pretty
specific
information.
it's
a
lot
more
than
a
tip.
the
tip
might
be
that
jones
is
engaged
in
a
narcotic
traffic.
that
might
be
a
tip
or
maybe
that
jones
and
richardson
are
selling
narcotics
but
never
really
were
in
part.
that's
a
tip.
but
here,
he's
got
specific
information.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
true.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
couldn't
state
from
personal
knowledge
but
i
would
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
guess
that
what
you
say
is
true,
justice.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
can't
say
whether
a
commissioner
would
do
it.
i
think
he
would
be
entitled
to
it,
he
might.
he
might
wish
to
know
that.
but
i
don't
know
whether
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
the
commissioner
does.
but
in
addition
to
this
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no,
sir.
i
do
not.
in
addition
to
this
specific
character
of
the
information,
we
have
a
knowledge
on
the
affiant's
part
that
these
people
are
narcotic
addicts,
that
they
displayed
needle
marks
and
that
the
statement
that
these
people
are
familiar
to
him,
i
think
that
has
to
be
taken
into
context
that
perhaps
it's
not
spelled
out
as
much
as
--
as
a
lawyer
might
or
a
prosecuting
attorney
might
put
this
man
as
a
police
officer.
he's
not
a
trained
prosecutor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
a
commissioner
is
a
lawyer,
but
the
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
think
that
the
commissioner
must
have
been
satisfied
that
that
was
a
meaning
of
that
paragraph.
besides
that,
the
--
the
warrant
--
the
application
--
the
affidavit
shows
on
its
face
that
there's
some
verification
for
this,
that
other
sources
of
information,
they'd
received
information
from
other
sources
the
same
as
they
had
received
from
--
as
he
had
received
in
the
narcotics
people
and
this
court
had
received
from
this
particular
source.
so,
you
have
--
and
he
said,
"the
same
information
regarding
the
illicit
narcotic
traffic
conducted
by
cecil
jones
and
earline
richardson
has
been
given
to
the
undersigned
and
other
officers
of
the
narcotics
brought
by
other
sources
of
information."
so
you
have
a
specific,
long
specific
detailed
source
of
information.
you
have
other
--
his
sources
of
information,
all
of
which
confirm
it.
the
question
is,
is
there
a
probable
cause?
does
he
have
a
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
the
narcotics
are
up
there?
does
he
have
a
reasonable
ground
as
a
reasonable
person
to
think
that
there's
an
offense
against
the
laws
of
the
united
states?”
if
there's
narcotics
there,
very
well.
he
has
specific
information.
his
information
from
the
source
has
previously
been
--
been
correct.
he
has
it
confirmed
by
other
sources,
other
sources.
any
of
his
knowledge
that
these
people
are
addicts
or
they've
been
using
narcotics.
that
put
it
all
together
in
looking
at
it
in
the
policeman's
knowledge,
reasonable
for
him
to
--
to
believe
that
the
story
that
he's
received
is
correct.
and
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
any
reasonable
man
would
--
would
have
a
basis
for
believing
them
the
offense
was
committed,
for
believing
that
the
narcotics
were
in
that
place.
and
the
--
the
judicial
officer
who
scrutinized
this
document
also
was
of
the
same
opinion,
had
two
men
that
thought
that,
reasonable
man
who
came
to
that
conclusion.
i
would
like
to
--
i
don't
think
the
question
is
so
much
as
to
whether
it
was
received,
the
warrant
was
issued
on
information,
it
might
be
hearsay.
but
what
kind
of
hearsay?
how
reliable?
how
reasonable
was
the
officer
in
relying
on
it?
and
i
think
in
that
case,
that
here,
there
are
certainly
--
certain
indicia
of
truthfulness,
a
veracity
enough
to
justify
a
man
to
rely
upon
that
information
and
to
act
upon
it.
and
i
think
that
is
all
that
probable
cause
requires.
now,
the
counsel
did
not
reach
the
third
part
of
this
argument
concerning
the
execution
of
the
warrant.
our
brief
does
not
raise
the
question
of
standing
here.
although,
it
might
well
had
been
raised
as
to
whether
he
had
standing.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
first
that
at
no
time
did
he
specifically
raise
this
question
below.
although,
he
asked
the
necessary
questions
of
his
defendant
and
cross-examined
the
police
officers.
but
he
never
raised
the
objection
as
the
execution
of
this
warrant
was
faulty.
and
therefore,
the
government
never
had
notice
of
that
objection,
never
had
an
opportunity
to
put
other
police
officers
on
the
stand
who
have
accompanied
officer
didone.
i
believe
there
were
three
of
them
at
least
there.
and
so
the
--
the
government
has
no
chance
to
corroborate
what
he
had
said
about
it.
and
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
least
in
this
court
would
do
is
to
consider
the
evidence
of
the
government
witness,
didone,
as
to
what
he
said
about
it.
they
considered
whether
or
not
testimony,
the
execution
was
valid.
and
it's
submitted
that
--
on
that
testimony,
the
--
there
was
a
compliance
with
18
u.s.c.
3109
which
provides
as
an
officer
may
break
into
a
home
to
execute
a
warrant
if
after
notice
of
his
authority
and
purpose,
he
has
refused
to
admittance.
now,
what
these
officers
did
was
in
effect
get
the
defendant
to
open
the
door
without
having
first
disclosed
their
identity.
regarding
they
opened
the
door,
they
first
knocked
several
times
and
he
asked,
“who's
there?”
they
didn't
answer.
he
finally
called
out
downstairs
someone
to
get
the
janitor.
there
are
people
at
his
door.
one
of
the
officers
went
downstairs.
he
got
the
janitor.
they
knocked
again.
and
when
he
called,
“who's
there?”
the
janitor
answered,
“janitor”.
therefore,
the
door
was
opened.
and
the
--
you'll
find
the
testimony
of
the
officer
on
record
page
37,
"the
door
was
opened
three
or
four
inches
and
he
had
a
knife
chain
attached
on
the
inside."
the
officer
said,
“i
had
my
wallet
opened
with
identification
exposed
and
i've
placed
this
inside
the
door
saying
i
had
a
search
warrant
for
the
premise.”
they
defend
who
had
opened
the
door
and
was
standing
directly
behind
the
partially
opened
door
there,
torn
and
went
straight
back
to
the
bathroom.
then
seeing
he
was
refusing
the
entrance,
i
placed
my
hand
on
the
chain
and
pulled
the
knife
--
pulled
the
knife
chains
that
loosed.”
so
there,
we
have
the
announcement
of
this
purpose
obvious
refusal
of
the
defendant
to
grant
him
immediate
entrance
and
thereafter
of
pulling
of
the
chain
and
affecting
a
forcible
entrance.
we
contend
that
the
statute
was
complied.
it
did
give
notice
of
his
authority
in
purpose.
again,
you'll
find
that
on
cross-examination,
his
testimony
on
page
45
which
he
--
he
said,
“i
identified
myself
as
a
police
officer
and
said
i
have
a
search
warrant."
he
recognized
the
defendant
and
he
immediately
turned
and
went
back
across
the
foyer
to
the
bathroom.
well,
the
opinion
of
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
feel
that
the
government
officer
should
have
announced
their
presence
when
they
first
--
in
their
identity
when
they
first
wrapped
on
the
door.
the
government
thinks
and
believes
that
police
officers
and
the
cases
where
they're
searching
for
evidence
or
things
which
are
not
evidence
but
things
which
have
been
used
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
or
contraband,
he
has
a
right
to
at
least
get
the
door
open
by
means
of
some
strategy.
there
was
no
--
to
deliver
and
no
lying
here.
they
just
knock,
they
didn't
answer,
unless
say,
of
course,
the
petitioner's
statement
of
what
transpired
various
greatly
and
from
that
of
the
government
witnesses.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
but
it
was
never
raised
below.
the
point
was
never
specifically
raised
and
thus,
the
government
was
never
given
the
opportunity
of
bringing
corroborating
witnesses.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
court
of
appeals
did
consider
the
question.
and
they
considered
it
on
the
basis
of
the
government's
evidence.
and
we
think
here
that
it
can
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
government's
evidence.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
--
i
do,
sir,
yes,
sir
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
because
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
don't
believe
that
the
lower
court
--
the
lower
court
certainly
never
determined.
that
point
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
was
never
--
but
none
on
this
record
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
i've
never
find
--
find
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
right.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
we
don't
even
say
that
it
can't
be
raised
on
appeal.
we
say
that
if
you
raise
this
and
if
you
consider
it,
consider
it
on
the
basis
of
the
government's
evidence.
even
bazelon
--
judge
bazelon
who
dissented
below
considered
it
on
the
basis
of
the
government's
evidence.
he
said
on
the
basis
of
the
government's
evidence.
he
found
that
he
would
have
--
he
dissent
it,
but
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
find
it
on
the
basis
of
the
defendant's
evidence.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
--
that's
my
understanding,
too,
of
course,
in
--
of
this
nature.
but
apparently,
the
circuit
court
did
--
did
go
into
it
and
did
decide
it
and
so
it
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
perhaps
not,
but
i
think
that
here,
we
--
we
can
safely
assume
that
the
government's
evidence
would
certainly
not
be
any
different
in
what
has
already
is.
it
would
merely
bring
two
other
witnesses
and
testify
to
substantially
the
same
thing.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
it
has
been
controverted
by
the
defendant.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
of
course,
he
might
bring
the
janitor.
he
might
bring
the
janitor.
i
don't
know.
the
janitor
was
there.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
they
--
they
decided
it
and
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
i
can't
quarrel
with
the
court
of
appeals,
but
we
--
we
strenuously
contend
that
on
the
government's
evidence,
certainly
there
was
a
compliance
with
the
statute.
there
was
an
announcement
of
the
authority
in
purpose.
he
was
refused
to
admit
admittance,
and
it
was
after
that
and
after
the
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
the
only
alternative
would,
of
course,
be
to
send
it
back
for
trial
on
that
point.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
personally
--
my
personal
view
point,
your
honor,
is
that
the
thing
ought
--
the
question
ought
not
to
be
here
at
all.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
of
course,
the
only
other
way
to
do
it
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
my
practical
answer,
of
course,
if
the
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
that's
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
--
i
--
i
--
if
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
if
the
defendant's
version
is
true,
it
was
--
if
the
defendant's
version
is
true,
well,
then,
of
course,
it
is
a
strong
point.
we
say
that
the
defendant's
version
is
not
true,
we
say
that
he
never
gave
us
the
chance
to
--
to
contest
it
any
further
then
he
never
asked
for
a
finding
by
the
court
below,
the
trial
court
on
this
point
and
that
therefore,
we
--
i
feel
that
he
completely
raised
the
point
that
it
should
not
be
here
but
the
circuit
court
didn't
take
it.
but
in
any
event,
the
--
the
court
should
desire
to
decide
this
point
on
the
record
before
it.
we
contend
that
the
fact
that
they
didn't
announce
their
presence
when
they
first
--
that
--
their
identity
and
the
purpose
when
they
first
wrap
on
the
door,
it
was
perfectly
all
right
that
officers
have
a
right
to
use
a
strategy
to
get
people
inside
to
open
the
door.
and
that's
obviously
because
if
you
knocked
on
the
door
and
say
you're
a
narcotic
agent
with
a
search
warrant,
the
evidence
and
the
contraband
is
going
down
the
drain
before
you
ever
get
inside
the
door.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no
one
is
going
to
(inaudible)
suppose
he
is
running
for
the
bathroom
there.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
say
the
provision
of
the
--
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
the
announcement
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
the
announcement
was
made,
the
announcement
was
made
before
he
broke
the
door,
before
he
pulled
the
latch
door,
the
string
--
the
chain
there,
before
he
pulled
the
chain.
as
soon
as
that
door
was
opened,
he
told
him
who
he
was
and
why
he
was
there.
the
man
ran
back.
he
was
refused
to
admit
and
so
he
went
in,
so
the
statute
was
complied
with.
government
justice
--
judge
bazelon's
only
complaint
was
that
you
didn't
comply
within
earlier,
and
my
answer
to
that
is
that's
utterly
impractical
because
if
you
come
across
to
that
extent,
you
might
not
never
need
to
worry
about
search
warrant
because
you're
never
going
to
find
any
narcotics
because
it's
going
down
the
drain
in
normal
reaction.
and
secondly,
there's
another
reason
in
the
cases
of
more
serious
nature.
if
you're
going
over,
this
has
been
applied
in
the
woods
case
to
arrest,
you're
going
to
arrest
around
a
desperate
character
and
you
tell
him
who
you
are
you'll
able
to
find
some
fellow
shooting
at
you.
and
so,
you
have
a
right
to
try
to
get
that
door
open
for
your
own
protection.
i
think
officers
have
that
right.
otherwise,
you
can
announce.
an
officer
announces
who
he
is
before
the
--
he
gets
and
then
to
open
the
door.
he's
likely
to
get
killed.
and
it's
a
real
serious
thing.
i'm
not
saying
every
case,
but
there
certainly
are
some
cases.
we
had
one
example
of
it
here
in
the
district.
for
example,
where
an
officer
was
killed,
he
never
know.
so,
they
have
a
right
to
take
precautions
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
contraband
and
the
materials
used
in
the
crime
and
to
protect
their
own
lives.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
[laughs]
your
honor
please,
the
--
the
narcotics
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
perhaps,
we
ought
to
clear
that
point.
when
the
officers
knock,
apparently,
the
defendant
went
into
the
bathroom,
and
he
--
he
leaned
outside
and
he
called
down
to
the
man
downstairs
who
was
a
detective
to
tell
him
that
someone
was
at
his
door
and
please
get
the
janitor.
but
at
the
same
time,
he
reached
around
and
so
he
went
to
--
into
an
awning
that
was
partially
closed,
apparently,
had
falls
and
there
was
a
bird's
nest
in
the
awning.
and
he
placed
his
hand
in
there,
and
it
was
in
the
bird's
nest
that
they
found
the
narcotics
and
the
adequate
paraphernalia.
in
other
words,
he
was
using
a
bird's
nest
which
the
birds
had
used
to
--
that
constructed
in
a
