i
suppose
if
you
have
occasion
had
given
a
car
on
a
trailer,
which
i
take
it's
one
that
is
wrong
personally,
i'd
suppose
anybody
who
do
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix

what
does
that
mean?
what
simple
interest
do
you
draw
from
paying
no
attention
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

so
obvious
that
no
reference
has
to
be
made
for
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
first
would
you
suggest
to
applicable
process
--
if
you
need
(inaudible)
to
process
in
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do?
justice
felix

all
of
this
shall
(inaudible)
present
itself,
only.
if
one
accepts
the
refinement
(inaudible)
refinement
about
having
the
right
(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
to
read
some

some
(inaudible)
what
relations
of
the
premises
were?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
body
of
lower
court
opinion,
all
doctorates
and
(inaudible)
satisfying
the
standing
requirements?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
good
many
of
these
cases,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
cases
that
discussed
what
--
what
satisfies
the
requirement
of
what
you
call
these
possessory
cases,
is
there
any
classification
to
be
--
to
be
made
of
cases
that
you'll
examine
as
to
what
is
the
minimum,
what
body
of
opinion
in
this
body
of
opinion
means
satisfactory
at
a
minute
of
one
--
one
end
of
a
spectrum
as
against
the
other?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
what
support
is
there
to
the
lower
court
opinion
that
they
think
that
your
view
on
this
record
satisfies
the
relationship
with
being
your
view
in
the
premises
and
supported
by
lower
court
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that's
--
assume
that
the
court
adopts
your
most
extreme
position
on
the
application
of
the
standing
rule,
what
body
of
opinion
of
lower
court
that
has
to
be
overruled
by
such
a
decision
of
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
whether
you
attached
no
significance
to
the
first
--
what
is
stated
on
the
first
paragraph,
the
source
of
information
goes
on
to
relate.
i
suppose
the
source
of
information
is
--
is
the
same
as
the
source
of
information
in
the
last
paragraph,
is
that
the
same
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
source
of
information
was
on
to
relate
that
on
many
occasions,
the
source
of
information
has
gone
to
said
apartment
and
purchased
on
not
exactly,
we
don't
mention
the
first
person.
the
narcotics
(inaudible)
makes
complaint
so
that
you
have
multiplicity
of
experience
is
not
a
single
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
suggest
that
he
has
lied
to
give
him
a
name?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
have
an
affidavit
when
--
when
search
or
application
for
a
search
warrant,
affidavit
on
which
a
search
warrant
is
sought,
if
you
knew
opportunity
for
cross-examination
assume
we
--
the
search
warrant
is
otherwise
satisfies
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
commissioner
can
ask
these
questions
on
this
warrant
on
the
basis
of
this
warrant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
whether
he
can
give
him
enough
to
the
commissioner
on
the
basis
of
which
he,
on
his
oath,
can
issue
a
warrant.
and
if
he
can
cross-examine
if
the
name
is
given,
he
can
cross-examine,
a
fortiori,
because
no
name
is
given.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
commissioner
may
have
known
the
liability
of
the
affiant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
think,
must
that
be
set
forth
in
the
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commissioner
is
certainly
--
and
where
was
it,
he
watched
him
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commissioner
probably
had
experience
to
this
particular
advice,
hadn't
before
again
and
again
and
again.
must
be
set
forth
in
the
warrant
whereas
i
am
confident
in
the
reliability
or
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
preduality
or
inpreduality
of
comments
he's
owning.
i'm
satisfied
that
his
interest
--
that
he's
with
reason
--
within
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
must
be
--
if
the
--
if
the
commissioner
is
satisfied,
you
say
on
the
basis
of
this
would
be
cross-examining
jones,
he
could
have
satisfied
his
actions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i'm
putting
to
you
is
that
a
past
experience,
he
may
have
known
that
didone
was
a
very
concerned,
conservative
sceptical
on
cross-examining
enforcement
officer.
and
that
when
he
says,
“i
had
a
tip
from
somebody
who
told
me
beyond
many
occasions,”
they
just
defined
that.
he
didn't
have
to
go
through
this
process
of
cross-examination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
no,
no.
but
it
goes
to
the
reliance
of
the
commissioner
may
make
on
didone's
asking
on
an
undisclosed
informer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
he'd
given
a
name.
suppose
he'd
given
the
informant's
name.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
may
not
be
enough.
and
the
commissioner
then
asks
on
that,
you
would
say
that
was
an
--
an
illegal
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
be
able
to
follow
your
argument
more
easily,
mr.
knapp,
would
you
tell
me
to
what
point
are
you
addressing
yourself
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
has
no
right
to
raise
the
question
that
he
has
standing
or
to
disapprove
that
he
has
standing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
going
hot
and
cold?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
he
going
hot
and
cold?
because
you
say,
“i
confess
that
he
could,"
that
part
of
a
relation,
that
he
could."
on
that
basis,
i
may
insist
on
my
legal
right
to
say
that
you
can't
break,
you
can't
get
the
evidence
against
me
except
by
legal
procedure,
a
proper
search
warrant
or
in
the
sequential
right,"
and
--
and
you
can
arrest
him
without
warrant.
in
other
words,
he
search
the
--
he
--
he
says,
"i
accept
your
premise.”
the
government
can
go
hot
and
cold.
the
government
can't
say
"i'm
--
i'm
in
possession,
but
i'm
not
in
possession
as
against
the
way
of
a
constitutionality."
and
in
addition
to
that
he
says
"go
ahead
and
prove
it."
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
not
inconsistencies.
justice

practically

having
been

(voice

he
isn't

he
isn't

forgive
me,
he
isn't

he
is

something

you're
right,
you
have
no

justice

that's
the

and

is

starting
point.

another
test.
justice

in
fact,
you
have
charged
him
with
possession
and
you

at
one
point
of
view,
you
may
rightly
say,
he

he
can't

i

it

he
may,

say,
“your

can
you
that
today?
justice

all
right.
justice

i
was
contesting
the
fact
that
even
in
possession,
he
simply
says,
“prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt

justice

i'm
suggesting
this
and
that
in

he
could
stand

justice

he
won't

you
from
