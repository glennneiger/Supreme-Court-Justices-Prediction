mr.
louis
henkin
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
cecil
jones
was
convicted
in
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
for
violations
of
the
harrison
act
and
he
is
now
in
the
federal
prison.
by
timely
and
proper
motions,
he
objected
that
all
the
evidence
against
him
was
unlawful,
unlawful
because
it
was
obtained
by
unlawful
seizure
pursuant
to
an
unlawful
search,
pursuant
to
an
unlawful
warrant.
the
government
never
claimed
that
the
search
was
lawful,
they
never
claim
the
warrant
was
lawful,
but
they
said
that
it
didn't
matter
and
so
for
purposes
of
this
part
of
our
case,
if
it
please
the
court,
we
submit
that
we
might
treat
the
case
as
though
the
prosecution
admitted
that
the
warrant
was
unlawful
and
that
the
search
or
seizure
were
unlawful
and
that
the
lower
court
so
held.
but
they
said,
nevertheless
the
evidence
did
not
have
to
be
excluded
and
the
conviction
could
stand
because
jones
did
not
show
--
did
not
show
the
proper
standing
to
object
to
the
evidence.
he
did
not
show
the
proper
standing
because
in
relation
to
the
premises,
he
asserted
only
the
qualities
of
a
guest.
and
in
regard
to
the
material
seized,
he
did
not
show
the
kind
of
interest,
the
kind
of
possession
which
is
necessary
to
sustain
this
standing.
well,
in
fact
if
the
court
please,
as
we
will
show
jones
was
the
occupant
to
the
apartment
searched.
in
fact,
the
government
in
a
formal
document
asserted
that
the
jones
was
the
occupant
of
the
apartment
searched.
in
fact,
the
government
tried
and
convicted
jones
of
possessing
the
narcotics
which
were
seized.
despite
that
fact,
they
said
that
jones
did
not
show
his
standing
and
so
as
a
result
--
mr.
louis
henkin
i
think
there's
a
slight
difference
between
the
government
and
us
on
that
question
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
as
we
read
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes.
in
that
event
we
submit
it
shouldn't
make
very
much
difference
because
if
the
court
of
appeals
did
what
the
government
in
its
footnote
suggested
that
we
believe
(inaudible)
mr.
louis
henkin
petitioner
certainly
is
and
my
impression
from
the
government
briefs
is
that
that
is
the
case.
and
so
it
seems
that
the
petitioner
--
mr.
louis
henkin
yes.
mr.
louis
henkin
if
we
get
by
the
standing
issue,
mr.
justice
whitaker,
the
question
that
remains
to
the
decided
is
whether
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
issuance
of
a
warrant.
the
only
document
before
the
commissioner
who
issued
this
warrant
sir
is
an
--
is
an
affidavit
and
that
affidavit
is
before
the
court.
we
submit
and
we
believe
the
government
agrees
that
that
kind
of
decision
as
to
the
adequacy
of
that
affidavit
to
support
the
warrant
is
one
which
can
be
decided
just
as
well
by
this
court.
it's
not
a
jury
question
in
any
sense
and
there
really
no
reason
for
sending
it
back
to
the
lower
court
in
these
circumstances.
the
facts
in
this
case,
if
the
court
permits,
are
not
in
dispute
so
far
as
it's
relevant
to
the
preliminary
issues
with
which
we
are
concerned.
on
august
21,
1957,
the
police
obtained
a
warrant
for
the
search
of
an
apartment
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
warrant
referred
to
the
apartment
as
occupied
by
cecil
jones
and
earline
richardson,
cecil
jones
is
the
petitioner
here.
the
affidavit
which
the
police
filed
with
the
commissioner
to
obtain
this
warrant
described
the
apartment
in
question
as
occupied
by
cecil
jones
and
earline
richardson.
when
the
police
armed
with
this
warrant,
came
to
the
apartment,
they
knocked
on
the
door.
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
what
happened
but
if
the
court
permit,
it
is
not
relevant
to
this
particular
issue
so
we
will
postpone
it
to
latte.
in
any
event,
it
is
clear
that
it
was
jones
who
answered
the
knock
and
said,
"who's
there?"
police
knock
again
and
again
it
was
jones
who
answered
that
knock.
it
was
jones
who
went
to
the
window
and
seeing
some
stranger
down
there
who
would
turn
out
to
be
as
plain
cloths
man
but
he
didn't
know
it,
said,
"call
a
janitor,
there's
someone
at
my
door
and
he
won't
go
away."
so,
when
they
called
the
janitor,
the
janitor
came
up
and
he
knocked
on
the
door
with
the
police
beside
him
and
when
the
janitor
knocked,
again
it
as
jones
who
answered
the
door
and
said,
"who
is
there?"
and
when
janitor
answered,
"it's
the
janitor."
he,
jones
opened
the
door
slightly
on
the
night
latch
at
that
moment
under
circumstances
reveal
described,
whether
the
police
broke
in
and
as
appears
quite
clearly
from
the
record,
they
treated
jones
as
in
charge
of
this
apartment.
well,
the
police
in
this
apartment
found
jones,
ms.
richardson
and
four
others.
they
found
some
narcotics.
the
police
decided
to
charge
mr.
jones
and
ms.
richardson
with
violations
of
the
harrison
act.
the
four
other
occupants
of
the
apartment
were
not
charged,
and
the
prosecution
against
the
ms.
richardson
was
apparently
never
pressed.
so,
jones
alone
was
held
responsible
for
what
happened
in
that
apartment.
now
if
it
please
the
court,
if
one
examines
the
documents
that
followed
immediately
after
this
arrest
defines
first
a
police
complaint
in
the
record
on
page
5,
a
final
commitment
in
the
record
on
page
6,
and
indictment
in
the
record
on
page
7,
all
charging
jones
with
possession
of
narcotics.
but
jones
shortly
after
his
arrest
made
a
motion
pro
se
in
which
he
asked
that
the
indictment
be
dismissed.
he
claimed
that
the
indictment,
that
the
--
his
relation
to
the
apartment
was
not
such
as
to
prove
the
government's
case
that
he
was
the
one
who
was
in
possession
of
whatever
was
in
it.
he
also
made
some
arguments
about
the
probable
--
no
probable
cause
apparently
either
for
a
search
warrant
or
for
arrest.
it's
not
very
clear.
it
is
a
--
it's
the
documents
of
an
illiterate
negro,
31
years
old
representing
himself
in
the
case
at
that
point.
well,
shortly
thereafter
the
--
he
was
assigned
counsel.
the
counsel
disowned
this
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
instead
counsel
made
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
on
the
ground
that
it
was
obtained
pursuant
to
an
unlawful
warrant
which
was
deficient
on
its
face.
at
the
hearing
of
this
motion,
the
government
oppose
that
on
the
ground
--
and
on
that
jones
did
not
show
the
necessary
standing
to
make
this
kind
of
a
motion
and
so
counsel
for
jones
put
him
on
a
stand
and
the
facts
which
--
to
which
he
testified
are
not
in
dispute.
he
said,
the
apartment
in
question
belonged
to
a
friend
by
the
name
of
arthur
evans
who's
some
five
days
earlier
had
left
washington
for
philadelphia.
he
gave
jones
a
key
to
the
apartment.
he
gave
him
authority
to
use
it.
jones
used
it.
he
had
a
suit
and
a
shirt
there
in
addition
for
the
clothes
he
was
wearing.
he
slept
there
"maybe
a
night,"
that's
what
the
record
shows.
well,
despite
this
evidence
the
motion
judge
denied
it.
he
said
that,
“cecil
jones
was
only
a
guest
and
therefore
had
no
standing
to
make
this
motion.”
then
the
parties
went
to
trial
and
at
the
beginning
the
trial
before
judge
holsoff,
counsel
for
jones
repeated
the
motion
and
judge
holsoff
took
the
position
that
he
was
bound
the
earlier
holding
and
he
did
not
reexamine
it.
at
the
trial,
the
government
present
of
its
case,
and
in
the
course
of
its
case,
it
introduced
evidence
in
which
it
showed
that
jones
had
said
to
the
policeman,
"i
live
in
this
apartment."
they
introduced
evidence
which
showed
that
jones
had
admitted
that
the
narcotics
were
his
or
some
of
them
were
his.
at
that
point
and
before
the
defense
introduced
its
case,
again
counsel
moved
to
exclude
this
evidence
and
the
trial
court
said
no,
noted
to
the
record
in
effect
didn't
do
anything
about
motion
and
jones
was
convicted.
on
appeal
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
divided,
affirmed
the
conviction
by
two
to
one
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
as
well
as
the
motion
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
key
to
this
standing
issue
we
submit
is
that
the
government
does
not
deny
that
jones
has
standing,
by
that
we
mean,
the
government
does
not
deny
the
facts
which
it
would
admit
are
enough
to
constitute
standing.
their
position
basically
is
that
jones
did
not
consult
affirmatively
show
these
facts,
assert
these
facts.
they
don't
deny
the
facts.
they
couldn't
deny
the
fact
because
one
of
the
facts
which
clearly
qualify
his
for
standing
his
possession
and
that
is
exactly
what
they
were
trying
to
prove
in
this
case.
but
there
are
several
basis
on
which
we
submit
our
--
mr.
louis
henkin
yes.
i
will
proceed
to
that
part
if
you
will
and
explain
incidentally
why
it
is
that
jones
didn't
allege
it.
there's
--
yes.
mr.
louis
henkin
at
the
time
of
the
motion
to
suppress
mr.
justice
whitaker
as
well
as
at
the
time
of
the
motion
to
exclude
at
the
end
of
the
government's
case
when
these
motions
were
ruled
out,
the
only
statement
by
jones
which
is
relevant
is
in
his
motion
pro
se
to
dismiss.
this
motion
was
assumed.
we
submit
that
it
was
in
general
an
undesirable
and
perhaps
unwise
move
on
his
part
to
make
this
motion,
he
being,
perhaps
being
advised
by
what
used
to
be
known
as
guardhouse
lawyers
in
jail
and
the
counsel
--
counsel
for
jones
did
disown
this
motion
but
further
we
submit
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
if
you
look
at
the
motion
to
dismiss,
he
does
not
disown.
in
fact,
if
and
the
motion
to
dismiss
itself
is
on
page
9
and
in
the
government's
brief
if
you
will,
we
explain
this
motion
to
dismiss
and
suggest
what
it
really
means.
mr.
louis
henkin
it
says
petitioner
respectfully
states
as
follows,
property
was
seized
not
from
petitioner
and
not
from
any
of
petitioner's
personal
property.
now
that
is
not
in
question,
the
--
the
narcotics
were
found
on
window
sill.
mr.
louis
henkin
that's
exactly
the
issue
mr.
justice
harlan
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
think
that
so-called
--
mr.
louis
henkin
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
to
mr.
justice
brennan
that
if
he
alleged
affirmatively
the
narcotics
are
mine,
the
government
would
have
then
included
his
affidavit
and
his
motion
and
tried
to
introduce
that
in
evidence
perhaps
successfully
as
we
will
discuss
in
a
few
minutes.
but
if
mr.
justice
whittaker,
to
return
to
your
point
if
i
may,
it
was
very
carefully
worded,
i'm
amazed
that
if
a
--
a
young
illiterate
negro
judging
from
some
of
his
writing
was
able
to
word
a
document
as
carefully
as
that
but
if
one
reads
it
carefully,
it
does
not
say,
"these
narcotics
are
not
mine."
it
simply
says
the
government
which
after
all
has
to
prove
its
case
can't
make
out
a
case
of
possession
merely
on
the
basis
of
my
relation
to
my
property
and
what
they
have
shown.
mr.
louis
henkin
well,
he
must
have
had
advised
to
over
her
shoulder
then
mr.
justice.
in
any
event,
if
the
court
please,
we
believe
that
this
motion
on
careful
reading
is
not
an
admission
that
the
narcotics
are
his.
we
believe
that
even
if
it
were,
not
a
--
not
a
statement
that
the
narcotics
are
not
his,
we
believe
that
even
if
it
were,
it
would
make
no
difference
under
the
cases
as
we
will
show
and
we
also
point
out
that
this
motion
was
disowned
and
on
the
whole
the
court
treated
it
and
did
not
refer
to
it
in
anyway
and
neither
does
the
government
make
much
of
it.
there's
--
we
submit
several
--
there
are
we
submit
several
grounds
on
which
jones
had
standing.
two
of
them
we
submit
are
so
obvious
that
the
only
trouble
with
that
is,
is
the
--
is
that
jones
himself
did
not
wish
affirmatively
to
assert
it
for
reasons
to
which
mr.
justice
harlan
alluded.
but
we
submit
in
the
first
instance,
that
even
on
what
jones
affirmatively
showed
at
the
time
of
the
first
motion
to
suppress,
jones
had
standing
to
object
to
the
search
and
seizure
and
therefore
to
object
to
the
introduction
of
the
evidence.
now,
if
the
court
pleases,
the
standing
in
the
sense
is
the
short
hand,
we
will
use
in
effect
for
saying
that
constitutional
rights
of
jones
himself
were
involved.
that
it
was
unreasonable
for
the
police
to
come
to
this
apartment
to
look
for
a
narcotic
of
jones's
without
a
lawful
warrant
and
the
assumption
now
is
that
the
warrant
was
not
lawful.
we
have
pointed
out
that
the
affidavit
and
the
warrant
refer
to
this
apartment
is
occupied
by
jones
and
the
occupancy
of
the
apartment,
no
one
has
ever
denied
is
enough
to
constitute
standing
to
object
to
searching
that
apartment.
one
might
have
thought
that
this
would
be
an
admission
by
the
government
with
which
it
ought
to
be
bound
but
while
we
suggest
that,
we
are
not
pressing
it
and
the
case
is
considerably
stronger
than
that.
the
rule
--
mr.
louis
henkin
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
mr.
justice
stewart(voice
overlap)
--
i
don't
know
what
the
word
means.
mr.
louis
henkin
i
said
i
don't
know
what
the
word
means
sir.
it's
a
phrase
used
by
the
lower
courts
which
established
rule
and
we
submit
that
it
ought
to
mean
control,
in
charge
of
the
apartment.
we
don't
know
what
the
government
thought
it
meant
when
they
used
it
on
the
warrant.
they
said
it
was
occupied
by
it.
the
standing
rule
to
which
we
are
now
referring
to
--
with
which
we
are
now
referring
mr.
justice
stewart
was
developed
at
the
trial
of
the
lower
federal
courts
as
we
shall
see
in
a
little
while
and
they
all
struggled
with
what
is
the
quantum
of
interest
which
one
has
to
show
for
standing.
now,
it
is
clear
that
either
a
necessary
quantum
of
interest
in
the
premises
of
search
or
--
or
of
in
the
disjunctive
or
the
necessary
quantum
of
interest
in
the
material
seized
are
enough
to
give
you
a
standing.
the
latter
was
held
in
the
jeffers
case,
three
years
ago.
well,
the
courts
below,
gentlemen
of
the
court
used
very
different
words
and
we've
collected
some
of
them
on
page
30
of
our
brief.
they
talk
about
control.
they
talk
about
dominion
of
the
premises.
they
talk
of
--
i
mean
necessary
of
an
interest,
of
some
interest
in
the
premises
some
of
them
just
say
anybody
but
a
trespasser
and
clearly
jones
was
not
a
trespasser.
some
of
them
use
the
phrase
“lawful
occupant,”
clearly
jones
was
a
lawful
occupant.
some
of
them
use
the
word
“licensee”
and
we
submit
without
wanting
to
get
into
the
niceties
of
property
law
that
mr.
jones
was
a
licensee.
some
say
dominion
and
control
and
we
submit
that
jones
one
the
admitted
the
facts
had
dominion
and
control
of
this
apartment.
the
government's
brief
on
page
26
if
the
court
permit
says
and
i
quote,
"he
did
not
in
any
realistic
sense
have
a
dominion
of
the
apartment."
well,
if
the
court
please,
that's
exactly
what
he
did
have
in
any
realistic
sense.
i
--
we
--
we
submit
we're
not
sure
what
the
word
“dominion”
supposed
to
mean
in
this,
but
any
realistic
sense,
jones
was
the
man
who
had
the
key
to
the
apartment,
the
authority
to
use
the
apartment,
and
he
was
the
man
who
acted
as
in
charge
of
the
apartment.
the
police
treated
him
as
in
charge
of
the
apartment
when
they
came
in
and
showed
him
a
--
showed
a
warrant,
they
didn't
show
it
to
five
other
people
sitting
in
that
room.
they
showed
it
to
jones.
we
submit
all
preferences
that
matter,
jones
was
the
man
in
charge
of
this
apartment
and
should
be
held
to
have
standing
to
object
with
seizure.
what
does
it
mean
that
he's
in
charge?
it
would
mean,
we
submit
that
he
has
a
right
to
keep
out
trespassers
and
i
would
have
thought
that
mr.
arthur
evans
in
length
in
the
apartment
would
not
only
want
him
to
but
insist
that
he
keep
out
trespassers
and
trespassers
we
submit
includes
the
police,
perhaps
a
fortiori,
if
they
come
in
unlawfully
without
a
warrant.
if
it
please
the
court,
we're
dealing
with
a
dwelling
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
standard
for
the
respect
for
dwelling
is
a
privacy
of
dwelling
is
--
is
high
it
should
be
observed.
but
--
mr.
louis
henkin
the
district
court
didn't
consider
this
case
in
terms
of
the
various
standards
which
we
quoted
from
some
of
the
other
cases.
they
didn't
discuss
whether
he
was
an
occupant
or
whether
he
was
a
licensee
or
what
he
had
dominion.
they
called
him
a
guest
and
that
seemed
to
settle
that.
of
the
guest
rule
--
mr.
louis
henkin
on
the
original
motion,
sir.
the
guest
rule
of
--
seems
to
have
been
invoked
more
often
in
the
district
court.
it
is
not
unanimously
involved.
in
any
event,
we
suggest
that
it's
a
rule
which
really
deserves
some
examination.
there
are
guests
and
guests.
if
someone
lends
me
his
house
for
a
year
and
i'm
living
there
as
a
guest,
i'm
sure
no
one
would
challenge
for
that
--
my
status
as
regard
to
the
fourth
amendment
and
under
--
in
that
house,
is
quite
different
from
perhaps
a
man
in
somebody
else's
house
of
20
other
people
there
and
he's
there
as
a
guest,
too.
mr.
louis
henkin
the
man
came
to
dinner
--
what
is
clear
is
that
no
--
no
guest
case
cited
by
the
district
judge
below,
no
case
cited
by
the
government
deals
with
the
kind
of
guest
you
had
in
this
case.
a
fellow
who
is
in
the
apartment
without
the
owner
there,
so
that
he's
a
guest
of
some
conceptual
sense,
of
course,
but
he's
not
there
by
sufferance
of
someone
else
who
has
the
right
and
the
power
to
assert
his
responsibility
for
the
apartment.
in
this
case,
and
this
is
the
only
case,
we
submit,
this
--
in
this
case,
he
was
in
charge
of
the
apartment
whether
you
call
him
guest
or
not.
if
arthur
evans
had
been
there,
that
might
be
a
different
question,
that's
not
the
course.
but
none
of
the
cases
cited
involved
a
case,
where
the
man
was
there
not
in
the
presence
of
the
owner
and
was
in
charge
of
the
apartment.
the
guest
rule
has
been
suggested
in
this
court
before,
it
has
never
been
decided.
in
the
mcdonald
case,
so
the
court
will
recall,
the
majority
said
even
if
we
assume
that
a
guest
in
the
apartment
of
another
--
in
the
presence
of
another
in
that
case,
has
no
standing
under
the
fourth
amendment,
we
will
still
exclude
the
evidence
because
it
had
to
be
excluded
from
mcdonald,
therefore,
we
would
exclude
it
for
washington.
on
the
notion
that
if
it
had
been
returned
to
mcdonald,
as
mcdonald
has
originally
requested,
it
wouldn't
be
available
for
washington.
three
of
the
justices
in
that
court
suggested
that
there's
no
reason
why
a
guest
should
not
enjoy
the
privacy
of
--
the
right
to
privacy
under
the
rooftree
of
a
friend
anymore
than
anybody
else.
what
basically
we
have
here
is
a
man
who
borrows
an
apartment.
and
a
man
who
borrows
an
apartment
should
have
the
same
rights
of
privacy
in
that
apartment
as
anyone
else,
as
anybody
who
owns
the
apartment.
interestingly
enough,
a
man
who
borrows
a
car
is
not
his,
just
borrows
it
for
an
afternoon,
no
one
has
ever
denied
his
right
to
object
to
the
seizure
of
that
car.
in
fact,
in
the
henry
case
decided
just
a
few
weeks
ago
here,
the
court
will
recall
that
henry
objected
to
the
seizure
of
materials
in
the
automobile
because
his
arrest
went
unlawful.
mr.
louis
henkin
perhaps,
sir.
in
the
henry
case,
interestingly
enough,
no
one
claimed
--
no
one
claimed
that
henry
didn't
have
the
right
to
object
to
the
seizure
of
the
materials
on
the
car
simply
because
it
wasn't
his
car.
in
fact,
he
was
not
only
a
guest
in
the
car.
he
was
a
guest
of
a
guest.
the
driver
borrowed
the
car
from
someone
else,
as
the
record
shows,
and
he
was
invited
to
ride
in
it
and
yet,
no
one
suggested
that
in
that
case
because
the
automobile
was
borrowed
rather
than
owned
or
because
the
owner
wasn't
there
or
because,
for
some
reason
or
other,
the
relation
to
the
automobile
is
only
temporary
that
therefore
he
should
have
no
standing
and
of
course,
the
automobile
would
generally
doesn't
have
anyone
near
the
kind
of
protection
that
--
that
the
dwelling
has.
there
is
one
case
before
this
court,
which
we
refer
in
our
brief
on
page
29,
the
kremen
case.
the
court
decided
that
per
curiam.
it's
--
it
appears
that
in
that
case,
the
crime
involved
was
harboring
fugitives
from
justice.
someone
had
hired
a
cabin
under
an
assumed
name
and
the
other
three
persons
were
found
in
the
cabin
with
them
and
they
searched
and
--
and
seized
lots
of
materials.
and
the
government
argued
in
that
case
and
the
lower
court
held
none
of
the
four
had
standing
and
yet,
the
supreme
court
just
reversed
per
curiam
without
--
just
asserting
the
fact
they
clearly
had
standing
in
effect.
the
--
one
can
deal
with
these
issues
in
terms
of
the
niceties
of
property
law.
but
in
the
question
really,
what
are
the
--
what
is
the
right
of
privacy
a
man
has
under
the
fourth
amendment?
one
of
the
district
court
cases
we
cite,
case
from
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
suggests
that
the
question
is
whether
it's
unreasonable,
if
it's
unreasonable
to
take
these
materials
from
this
person,
then
that
person
should
have
a
right
to
stand.
now,
it's
a
circular
test
obviously
and
yet,
it
maybe
a
perfectly
proper
way
of
handling
questions
of
--
which
are
often
merely
questions
of
degree.
it
seems
to
us
quite
clear
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
jones
had
a
right
of
privacy.
in
this
apartment,
he
had
a
right
to
keep
out
trespassers.
he
had
a
right
to
keep
out
police
without
a
warrant.
he
should
clearly
have
standing
to
object
to
the
unlawfulness
of
the
warrant.
but
the
case
really
is
considerably
stronger
than
that.
what
happened
after
the
motion
was
denied
was
that
it
was
repeated
at
the
beginning
at
the
trial
and
judge
holtzoff
said,
“i
am
bound
by
what
the
previous
judge
had
done
on
motion.”
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
and
the
court
said,
"i
am
bound
by
that
motion
and
didn't
consider
it."
well,
as
we
shall
saw
--
as
we
shall
see
--
we
question
whether
that
decision
was
correct,
but
we
don't
think
it's
important
enough
to
stop
on
it.
after
the
government's
evidence
was
in,
counsel
asked
again,
and
it
appears
in
--
in
the
record
on
page
56,
counsel
asked
again
to
note
that
we
object
to
the
inclusion
of
this
government's
testimony.
and
it
was
noted
for
the
record
and
the
court
didn't
--
didn't
affirm
--
didn't
grant
the
motion.
well,
by
this
time,
lots
--
more
evidence
was
before
the
court.
by
this
time,
the
government
had
introduced
its
whole
case.
it
introduced
evidence
which
said
that
he
had
been
living
in
this
apartment.
it
introduced
evidence
which
said
that
he
was
in
possession
of
narcotics.
and
not
only
introduced
this
evidence,
but
it
must
have
proved
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
because
these
were
the
evidence
in
which
this
man
was
later
convicted
of
possession,
so
that
at
least
as
to
his
relation
to
the
narcotic
seized,
the
evidence
was
“beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
these
were
his”.
well,
the
government
--
the
government
doesn't
deny
any
of
this,
but
it
seems
to
take
the
position
that
it
came
too
late
that
once
a
motion
is
denied
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial,
now,
then,
the
court
needn't
to
stop
in
the
course
of
the
trial
to
reexamine
this
question.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
yes.
we
believe
the
government
is
mistaken
in
its
position
as
to
what
the
trial
judge
should
have
done
at
this
time
and
the
answer
seems
clear
on
the
basis
of
the
gouled
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
40
and
41.
and
in
fact,
the
entire
portion
of
the
gouled
case
which
is
relevant
to
this
point
is
quoted
in
that
--
in
that
brief
at
that
point.
what
happened
--
this
was
--
came
up
on
a
certified
question.
and
the
court,
in
effect,
said
if
there'd
been
a
motion
to
deny,
which
was
to
suppress
earlier,
which
had
been
denied,
but
it
appeared
in
the
course
of
the
trial
that
the
evidence
was
unconstitutionally
seized
should
the
trial
court
have
stopped
and
examined
it.
and
the
court
said
quite
clearly,
“sure,
we
don't
want
the
trials
interrupted,
but
that's
only
as
--
rule
of
procedure
and
should
not
stand
on
the
way
of
constitutional
right.”
the
--
the
duty
of
the
trial
judge
at
that
moment
was
as
soon
as
it
appeared
probable,
it
don't
have
to
appear
certain,
so
it's
appeared
probable
that
it
had
been
an
unconstitutional
seizure
just
to
stop
and
see
whether
there
had
been
an
unconstitutional
seizure.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
and
no
one
had
suggested
that
the
rules
had
been
changed
on
any
of
these
points,
sir.
in
fact,
the
--
the
question
which
the
district
court
had
to
decide
at
this
moment,
we
believe,
is
one
that
could
have
take
--
it
didn't
have
to
go
to
the
jury.
it
didn't
have
to
do
anymore
than
spend
15
minutes
looking
at
the
affidavit
and
deciding
whether
to
do
what
he
had
never
done
before
which
is
look
at
that
affidavit
and
decide,
is
it
adequate
for
the
warrant.
the
court
didn't
do
that
and
the
gouled
case
and
the
amos
case
decided
the
same
day,
seemed
fairly
clear
to
show
that
the
court
--
if
it
--
if
it
exercised
any
discretion,
which
doesn't
seem
to
be
clear,
abused
him.
the
government
cites
one
case
in
opposition
and
that
is
segurola,
cited
in
the
government
brief
on
page
33.
that's
a
very
different
case.
in
segurola,
there
was
no
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
before.
no
objection
before
the
trial
at
all.
and
at
the
trial,
the
objection
is
made
to
the
--
to
the
admission
of
the
liquor
had
nothing
to
do
with
--
with
search
and
seizure
or
--
or
unlawful
arrest.
afterwards,
the
man
said
--
the
counsel
said,
“well,
in
any
event,
we
believe
it
should
be
suppressed.”
the
court
said,
“it's
quite
clearly,
this
motion
is
an
afterthought
and
you
come
too
late.”
that
didn't
happen
in
our
case.
jones
made
his
motion.
and
the
facts
in
support
of
that
motion
and
they
didn't
appear
at
the
time
appeared
during
the
course
of
the
trial
under
gouled
names
and
we
believe
that
the
trial
judge
should
have
stopped
and
looked
at
the
affidavit.
the
government
says
in
effect,
“yes,
but
it's
different.
in
gouled,
what
appeared
in
the
course
of
the
trial
was
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
seizure.
here,
what
appears
in
the
course
of
the
trial
is
the
standing
to
raise
the
unconstitutionality."
we
don't
see
why
that
should
make
any
difference.
but
in
any
event,
the
reason
it
didn't
appear
in
the
course
of
the
trial
that
was
unconstitutional
is
because
we
had
never
been
allowed
to
prove
that
the
warrant
was
bad.
if
we
assume,
as
we
may
assume
for
this
probable
case
that
the
warrant
was
bad,
there
must
be
standing,
appears
all
the
elements
necessary
to
prove
unconstitutionality
of
either
case.
there's
still
one
further
and
perhaps
the
crucial
issue
in
cases
of
this
kind
is
the
one
to
which
mr.
justice
harlan
was
referring
before
the
lunch
and
recess.
these
crimes
are
what
we
might
call
possession
crimes.
all
the
government
has
to
prove
is
possession.
the
government
admits
that
possession,
and
it
doesn't
claim
it's
a
different
kind
of
possession,
government
admits
that
possession
of
the
narcotics
is
enough
to
constitute
standing,
so
that
the
whole
government
case
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
government
--
that
the
defendant
has
that
relation
to
these
narcotics
which
justifies
him
in
objecting
to
their
introduction
if
they
were
unlawfully
seized.
again,
there
was
--
by
this
time,
not
only
the
warrant
and
the
affidavit
of
the
complaint
and
the
indictment
and
all
the
evidence,
all
charged
possession
under
--
under
the
jeffers
case
to
be
quite
clear
that
possession
is
all
you
have
to
prove.
but
they
say
it's
not
enough
because
jones
must
claim
possession.
and
what
is
cited
as
an
old
opinion
of
judge
learned
hand,
for
whom
i
have
the
highest
respect.
in
connolly
v.
medalie
in
which
he
said
in
effect
the
motion
to
suppress
is
a
pleading
and
the
petitioner
has
to
assert
the
facts
which
justify
his
standing
under
it.
he
said
in
effect,
“the
right
to
object
is
--
to
evidence
is
remedial.
it's
--
it
only
amount
with
the
constitutional
--
with
the
constitutional
privilege
which
is
being
infringed
has
a
right
to
object
and
therefore,
he
must
show
this
constitutional
privilege."
he
also
went
out
to
say
that
of
course,
a
man
may
hesitate
to
admit
possession
of
contraband
but
that's
--
that's
tough.
that's
one
of
the
difficult
things
in
life.
if
he
wants
--
if
he
wants
the
benefits
of
possession,
then
he
ought
to
have
bare
the
burden
of
possession.
well,
with
all
due
respect,
there
are
number
of
things
to
be
said
about
judge
hand's
opinion,
but
even
if
it
--
even
assuming
it
--
we
could
not
distinguish
it
which
we
believe
we
can,
we
believe
it's
erroneous.
mr.
louis
henkin
we
believe
--
we're
not
claiming
that,
sir.
that
is
one
of
the
points
we
argue
in
our
brief.
but
we've
--
at
this
point,
we're
arguing
--
mr.
louis
henkin
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
mr.
louis
henkin
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
and
we're
now
concern
with
the
fact
that
this
was
a
--
this
was
a
case
where
possession
i.e.
the
same
fact
which
constitutes
standing
is
the
crux
of
the
crime
is
what
the
government
claims
from
the
beginning
and
is
what
the
government
proved.
well,
they
insist
however
that's
not
enough.
jones
has
to
file
that
motion,
and
jones
has
to
say,
“i
possess
it.”
one
might
ask
perhaps,
“well,
why
doesn't
he?”
and
of
course,
mr.
justice
harlan
gave
the
answer
before
because
he
find
himself
on
a
whipsaw.
it's
interesting
to
read
the
records.
if
you
read
on
the
motion
to
suppress
where
the
objection
to
the
motion
was
lack
of
standing
that
jones
is
minimizing
his
relation
to
the
apartment,
although
it's
in
his
interest
on
that
motion
to
maximize
it,
the
government
is
trying
to
prove
he
had
more
relation
to
that
apartment
although
on
the
motion,
it
was
in
its
interest
to
minimize
it.
and
the
reason
--
the
reason
is,
as
the
government
said
quite
clearly,
“the
cases
show
that
if
he
makes
this
motion,
either
the
motion
or
the
affidavit
can
be
introduced
against
him.”
what
does
this
mean?
it
means
that
in
order
to
--
that
in
these
possession
cases,
in
these
possession
cases,
in
order
to
assert
as
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment,
a
man
must
--
must
incriminate
himself.
he
must
give
up
his
rights
under
the
fifth.
and
it
isn't
really
only,
if
this
is
accurate,
it
isn't
really
only
a
choice
between
the
two
amendments.
they
tend
to
nullify
each
other
because
the
man
is
in
a
dilemma.
and
the
dilemma
is
judge
hand's
word.
if
he
claims
possession,
then
they
will
introduce
us
admission
and
that's
it.
if
he
doesn't
claim
possession,
then
they
introduce
the
evidence
and
that's
it.
so,
he
--
the
two
things
nullify
each
other.
mr.
louis
henkin
we
--
we
claim
that,
sir.
we
claim
that
he
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
in
these
possession
cases
because
--
because
the
element
of
possession
is
supplied
for
him
by
the
government.
we
also
submit,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
even
if
he
disclaims
it
in
the
first
instance,
it
shouldn't
matter
if
in
fact
the
government
has
--
the
government
shows
possession.
that
the
--
the
result
of
all
this
is
certain
that
the
government
succeeds
in
these
cases
in
convicting
a
man
on
unlawfully
seized
evidence.
this
is
the
result
of
these
cases
because
if
the
man
for
any
reason
and
--
and
these
cases,
the
reasons
are
fair
and
confusion
and
the
fact
that
the
cases
are
not
clear
and
the
map
for
any
reason
refrains
from
objecting
to
the
evidence
although
he's
--
this
isn't
case
where
he's
waiving
his
rights.
this
isn't
the
case
where
he
--
where
there's
any
doubt
about
his
possession.
the
government
insisted
his
possession.
but
in
--
in
all
these
cases,
the
result
of
this
is
that
this
man
is
convicted
on
unlawfully
seized
evidence.
not
all
--
not
all
the
--
the
cases
below
have
followed
judge
hand.
we
cite
in
our
brief
the
dean
case
which
says
just
the
other
way.
it
says
the
--
it's
the
government
who
has
to
prove
possession,
even
if
he
denied
that
in
the
first
instance.
when
the
government
later
claims
possession,
they
shouldn't
be
in
a
position
to
deny
it.
in
the
williams
case,
also
cited
in
our
brief,
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
the
man
had
--
again,
earlier
this
claimed
possession,
the
court
said,
“when
the
government
later
brings
in
evidence,
it
shows
that
it
--
he
did
have
possession,
that
order
give
him
standing.”
the
point
is
that
a
man
should
not
be
able
to
be
convicted
on
evidence
unlawfully
seized.
the
same
point
has
been
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
illinois
--
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
the
grau
case
where
they
say,
“at
least
to
regard
to
a
dwelling,"
and
that's
all
that
we
have
here.
we
don't
have
to
decide
what
we
would
do
in
another
case.
"at
least
to
regard
to
a
dwelling
the
--
the
person
should
not
be
forced
to
incriminate
himself
in
order
to
assert
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment."
the
government
says
in
its
brief
that
the
supreme
court
has
never
held
that
the
--
that
he
makes
this
motion,
it
could
be
used
against
him.
that
is
true.
the
supreme
court
has
never
held
it.
some
lower
courts
have
held
it,
as
we
say
in
our
brief.
we
--
we
believe
that
those
lower
courts
maybe
erroneous
but
the
result
has
been
that
counsel
after
counsel
and
defendant
after
defendant
has
been
afraid
to
assert
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
louis
henkin
that's
right,
sir.
and
--
and,
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
i
may,
this
is
not
--
this
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
who
shall
have
the
dilemma,
whether
the
individual
shall
have
the
dilemma
or
the
government
shall
have
the
dilemma.
if
it
came
to
a
choice
of
that,
we
suggest
that
it
should
be
the
government
which
has
the
dilemma,
but
that
--
we
don't
really
think
that
that's
choice
because
the
--
if
we
exclude
evidence
where
the
government
claims
that
he
had
possession
and
in
fact,
the
man
didn't
have
possession,
so
that
the
exclusion
was
erroneous,
it
doesn't
do
him,
the
government,
any
harm
because
he
hadn't
committed
the
crime
anyhow,
the
crime
as
possession.
whereas
in
his
case,
in
his
case,
if
you
force
him
to
make
this
choice,
the
result,
i
repeat,
the
result
is
to
convict
this
man
an
unlawfully
seized
evidence.
in
the
kremen
case,
which
i
referred
to
a
little
while
ago,
the
government
brief
in
this
court
objected
that
nobody
had
claimed
possession
or
ownership
of
any
of
the
material
seized,
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
the
reference
is
on
page
22
of
the
government
brief
in
the
kremen
case
and
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
the
supreme
court
just
didn't
see
to
pay
attention
to
it.
mr.
louis
henkin
that
--
the
court
paid
no
attention
to
the
argument
but
held
that
the
--
that
the
people
in
question
had
standing
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
us,
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
fared
to
assume
that
the
court
held
that
this
gentlemen
had
standing
although
they
had
not
claimed
it.
mr.
louis
henkin
so,
it
seems
so,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
i
hope
so,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
the
--
there's
was
one
other
case
to
which
we
refer
--
which
i'd
like
to
mention
and
that
is
notice
that
in
the
kremen
case
and
in
the
agnello
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
it
wasn't
even
all
these
possessory
crimes.
it
was
even
--
it
was
another
crime.
the
court
simply
said
that
fellow
--
if
the
fellow
denies
it
and
you
proved
it
for
him,
that's
all
right,
you
proved
his
standing.
mr.
louis
henkin
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
that's
right.
there
is
a
--
the
case
of
white
and
texas
is
an
interesting
one.
it
was
a
case
of
a
--
in
310
u.s.,
it
was
a
case
of
a
coerced
confession
in
a
state
court,
and
the
state
challenged
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
object
to
the
coerced
confession
because
he
denied
he
ever
signed
it.
and
they
said,
“well,
if
you
didn't
sign
it,
then
it's
not
yours,
what
your
--
what's
your
past?”
the
supreme
court
unanimously
threw
that
argument
out.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
well,
since
either
relations
of
the
premises,
sir,
or
relation
to
the
materials
were
enough,
we
wouldn't
have
to
do
that.
but
we
have
been
arguing
this
case
at
--
to
this
point
on
the
assumption
that
the
rule
which
the
federal
--
lower
federal
court
developed
that
a
man
must
have
standing
to
challenge
this
is
sound.
having
said
what
we've
said
maybe
we
have
no
standing
to
object
to
the
standing
rule
because
we
have
standing.
nevertheless,
as
our
brief
argues,
we
aren't
disposed
unless
it
were
necessary
to
argue
that
the
supreme
court
should
throw
out
what
all
the
lower
federal
courts
have
held
with
the
virtue
of
the
unanimity.
but
the
court
can't
decide
this
question
against
jones
unless
without
at
the
same
time
finding
that
the
standing
rule
is
necessary.
if
you
find
we
have
standing,
that's
fine.
but
if
you
should
find
we
have
no
standing,
then
the
court
must
face
whether
standing
is
necessary.
and
on
this
--
as
our
brief
argues,
the
standing
notion
is
based
on
the
--
as
based
on
the
idea
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
remedial,
that
is
to
make
it
up
to
the
fellow
whose
rights
had
been
deprived.
in
fact,
the
government
admits
that
"a
--
a
major
purpose,"
i'm
quoting,
"a
major
purpose
of
this
exclusionary
rule
is
deterrence".
obviously,
it
will
deter
more
if
you
also
exclude
not
only
in
the
case
where
a
man
has
standing
but
also
in
the
case
where
a
man
hasn't
standing.
the
time
when
--
when
this
rule
of
exclusion
was
what
mr.
wigmore
called
a
terrible
exception
is
long
gone.
i
suggest
then
--
and
since
the
time
when
this
rule
is
developed,
another
doctrine
of
this
court,
the
doctrine
of
mcnabb
and
the
cases
which
followed
it,
both
notions
of
deterrence
and
discipline
of
the
police
and
perhaps
the
notion
that
(inaudible)
which
is
we
don't
want
our
court
soiled
with
dirty
evidence.
that
the
evidence
is
dirty
no
matter
whose
rights
were
violated.
and
if
it
should
be
necessary
to
reach
that
question,
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
mr.
justice
traynor's
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeal
--
for
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
which
he
tries
--
he
--
he
attempts
to
show
that
the
whole
motion
of
standing
is
based
on
a
misinterpretation
of
the
cases
of
this
court.
the
--
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
in
regard
to
jones
and
the
premises,
sir,
we
cite
the
opinions
of
lower
courts
in
our
brief
in
which
they
speak
of
the
standards.
one
court
says
everyone
but
a
trespasser.
this
is
the
standard
they
suggest.
well,
jones
clearly
wasn't
a
trespasser.
some
of
them
speak
of
occupant.
some
speak
of
dominion.
we
suggest
that
jones
satisfies
--
satisfies
those.
this
is
all
in
relation
to
the
premises
which
are
an
independent
ground
from
across
the
relationship
which
we
try
to
show
to
--
which
we
say
the
government
has
shown
for
his
relationship
to
the
materials.
in
the
time
that
it
left
--
mr.
louis
henkin
our
most
extreme
position,
your
honor,
is
that
no
standing
is
necessary.
mr.
louis
henkin
if
you
went
that
far,
you've
had
to
overrule
them
all.
mr.
louis
henkin
on
the
possession
case
--
on
the
possession
cases,
the
--
the
large
majority
makes
no
distinction
between
possession
cases
and
non-possession
crimes.
but
the
number
of
cases
which
consider
this
question
is
--
is
--
maybe
there
--
i
think
almost
all
the
cases
which
really
consider
this
problem
of
the
possession
crime
and
we
cite
the
--
the
dean
case
and
the
williams
case
seems
to
be
in
that
category.
commonly,
a
modality
the
--
the
hand
opinion
in
1932
considers
it
but
not
very
fully.
it
doesn't
deal
with
it
in
terms
of
fourth
and
fifth
amendment.
it
just
says
man
is
in
dilemma.
so,
in
fact,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
one
can
decide
this
case
on
the
very
narrowest
ground,
and
i'm
not
sure
which
is
narrower,
either
of
this
that
this
is
a
possession
crime
and
the
government
clearly
proved
our
standing
or
on
this
relation
to
the
premises,
his
fellow
was
in
charged
of
the
apartment
and
he's
an
occupant
and
to
do
that,
it'd
be
very
little
overruling
on
--
on
that
last
point
at
all.
mr.
louis
henkin
any
cases
which
should
have
to
be
overruled?
yes,
sir.
they
didn't
consider
this
very
carefully
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
the
government's
brief
in
effect
says
courts
have
never
distinguished.
i'm
not
sure
they've
been
asked
to
distinguish
but
they
never
distinguished
between
the
possession
crimes
and
the
others.
if
the
petitioner
has
a
standing,
then
the
government
and
we
are
agreed
that
this
court
ought
to
consider
the
validity
of
the
warrant.
and
obviously,
if
he
has
standing
invalid
and
the
warrant
is
invalid
that
disposes
of
the
case.
there's
a
third
issue
in
the
case
which
i
won't
have
time
to
reach
but
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
on
the
probable
cause.
what
do
we
--
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
it
did.
it
raised
in
the
court
below
for
the
first
time,
they'll
not
raise
in
the
lower
court.
the
court
of
appeals
--
this
is
the
question
of
whether
the
warrant
is
properly
executed
under
section
3109.
one
doesn't
have
to
get
to
that
question
if
you
find
for
jones
on
standing
plus
probable
cause.
and
unless
the
court
wants
to
ask
some
questions
about
that
last
point,
we
are
prepared
to
stand
on
our
brief
in
relation
to
that
point.
but
in
regard
to
probable
cause,
we
think,
and
i
should
not
like
to
use
these
words
carelessly,
we
think
that
this
is
the
most
shocking
and
flimsiest
case.
the
flimsiest
case
of
any
reported
case
we
have
found
of
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
for
a
search
of
a
dwelling.
in
fact,
i
don't
know
if
any
flimsier
one
even
for
the
search
of
an
automobile
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
the
defense.
what
do
we
have
here?
we
have
a
tip
from
an
informer
plus
the
affidavit
says,
the
affidavit
is
contained
on
page
3
of
the
record,
if
the
court
will,
"received
information
that
cecil
jones
and
earline
richardson
were
involved
in
the
illicit
narcotic
traffic
etcetera
and
kept
a
ready
supply.
the
same
information
regarding
narcotics
had
been
given
to
the
undersigned
and
other
officers
from
other
sources
of
information.
if
i
may
stop
for
a
moment
just
on
the
nature
of
this
tip,
the
informer
is
not
named.
there
is
no
affidavit
from
the
informer
either
given
to
the
police
or
given
to
the
commissioner.
mr.
louis
henkin
no
indication
that
he's
a
police
officer,
sir.
no,
no
--
neither
name
nor
identity
in
--
in
terms
which
are
meaningful
except,
and
the
words
are
very
important
to
note
because
it
seems
that
the
man
who
drafted
this
seem
to
weigh
them
very
carefully.
he
said
all
that
about
this
man
--
this
first
source
of
information
has
given
information
to
the
undersigned
on
previous
occasion,
on
previous
occasion.
to
us,
that
sounds
like
a
nice
way
of
trying
to
say
one
previous
occasion,
at
least,
it
doesn't
say
more
than
one
previous
occasion
and
which
was
correct,
so
we
know
that
there
wasn't
a
tip
from
this
informer
once
before
that
it
was
correct.
we
do
not
know
whether
there
were
any
other
tips.
we
do
not
know
how
many
tips
he
may
have
given
which
were
incurred.
and
this
--
this
is
what
is
given
to
the
commissioner.
this
is
what
is
given
to
the
commissioner
and
it
supposed
to
produce
not
cause,
not
some
cause,
not
the,
as
this
court
said
in
henry
case,
not
reasons
to
suspect
the
probable
cause.
this
is
what
is
given
to
the
commissioner
under
an
affidavit
when
the
constitution
requires
oath
and
affirmation
but
the
old
test
should
be
meaningful.
you
--
if
you
want
to
say
something
under
oath,
it
--
the
oath
is
the
--
is
the
safe
guard.
the
man
has
to
be
able
to
testify
to
something
under
oath
so
that
if
he's
lying
about
it
would
mean
something.
mr.
louis
henkin
what
--
mr.
louis
henkin
we're
not
claiming
that,
sir.
this
court
said
in
the
brinegar
case
that
it
doesn't.
of
course,
that
was
not
a
dwelling
case,
and
the
brinegar
case
clearly
said
that
dwelling
cases
are
different,
but
we're
not
claiming
that
all
hearsay
as
such
is
--
is
inadequate.
we're
saying
--
we
are
saying
that
there
is
no
case
where
hearsay
alone
from
an
unidentified
informer
without
anything
about
him
with
--
the
--
the
government
didn't
even
do
what
it
does
in
all
these
cases.
it
calls
the
man
reliable,
but
the
government
doesn't
call
him
unreliable.
the
magistrate
or
the
commissioner
here
has
no
assumption
to
assume
he's
reliable.
they
didn't
even
give
him
that
label
of
reliability
which
maybe
a
judgment
to
which
--
to
which
either
they
find,
he
could
testify
or
maybe
the
court
--
the
commissioner
might
have
cross-examined.
mr.
louis
henkin
previous
occasion,
sir,
is
what
it
says
--
mr.
louis
henkin
and
--
and
we
suggest
that
if
--
if
the
police
commissioner
--
the
police
officer
himself
may
not
fail
if
that's
necessarily,
that
that
necessarily
makes
him
a
reliable
informant.
in
any
event,
sir,
even
if
we
were
to
assume
that
this
man
was
a
reliable
informant,
there
is
no
case
that
we
found
where
all
you
have
is
a
tip
from
a
reliable
informant.
mr.
louis
henkin
your
honor,
the
police
says
he
--
the
--
the
affidavit
says
he
was
familiar
to
police,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
so
as
the
commissioner
probably.
what
does
familiar
to
police
mean?
is
it
if
the
suggestion
is
that
he
was
familiar
to
police
because
he
had
a
previous
record
which
seems
to
be
what
we
find
--
was
trying
to
give,
the
--
the
answer
is
that
he
had
no
previous
record
relating
to
narcotics.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
that's
right,
sir,
familiar
as
what?
it
doesn't
say
--
it
doesn't
--
it
--
it
seems
to
me,
sir,
that
the
fellow
was
trying
to
suggest
he's
a
shady
character.
well,
he
can't
--
he
can't
suggest
that
and
it's
meaningless.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
the
only
other
--
the
only
other
question
--
the
only
other
point
mentioned
is
that
these
persons
were
addicts.
all
about
it
is
we
say
two
things.
the
notion
that
an
addict
is
probably
a
pusher,
if
i
may
use
it,
is,
i
think,
not
one
about
which
one
would
--
could
make
a
claim
of
probability.
there
were
--
people
in
this
room,
all
of
them
were
set
to
be
addicts.
only
of
them
were
charged
with
this
crime,
so
it
would
guess
that
the
law
of
probability
seemed
to
work
2-to-1
against
the
notion
that
--
in
this
context
that
an
addict
is
a
pusher.
but
in
addition
to
this,
it
isn't
even
very
clear,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
that
this
statement
was
made
as
of
his
own
knowledge.
it
was
ambiguous
here,
sir.
but
if
you
look
at
the
record,
it
shows
that
at
least
as
to
earline
richardson,
at
least
as
to
earline
richardson,
his
statement
that
she
was
a
narcotics
addict
came
to
him
from
others.
this
is
referred
to
in
the
--
in
the
record
on
page
46,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
on
its
face,
we
believe,
on
its
face,
this
warrant
doesn't
show
what
is
necessary.
there
is
one
final
point,
if
i
may,
mr.
whittaker,
on
this
question.
this
is
not
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
mr.
jones.
mr.
louis
henkin
this
is
a
warrant
for
the
search
of
a
property.
as
to
this
apartment
which
jones
didn't
own,
as
we've
said,
the
notion
that
jones
as
an
addict
is
utterly
irrelevant
to
whether
there
are
drugs
in
this
apartment
that
jones
that
--
the
notion
that
jones
is
but
familiar
is
utterly
irrelevant
to
whether
there
are
drugs
in
this
apartment.
the
only
thing
you
have
as
to
the
apartment
is
the
tip,
plain
unvarnished
tip.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
you
have
a
single
tip
claiming
multiplicity
of
experience.
mr.
louis
henkin
if
the
tip
sir,
if
the
tip
is
insufficient,
because
at
some
--
a
tip
maybe
insufficient
for
a
number
of
reasons,
one,
maybe
just
lack
of
reliability.
and
if
it
lacked
of
reliability
and
the
fact
that
someone
maybe
lying,
well,
if
he
can
lie
about
the
fact
that
there's
narcotics
there,
it's
just
as
easy
to
lie
that
he
--
that
there
were
narcotics
there
20
times.
mr.
louis
henkin
not
if
i
could
cross-examine
him,
if
i
had
an
affidavit.
he
didn't
say
this
under
oath,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir,
the
commissioner
can
cross-examine
the
police
officer.
in
fact
that
--
mr.
louis
henkin
well,
he
didn't
as
far
as
we
--
mr.
louis
henkin
well
--
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
we're
not
challenging
the
inadequacy
of
the
affidavit.
we're
challenge
--
challenging
the
warrant.
if
on
this
affidavit
the
commissioner
had
cross-examined
him
and
got
some
additional
information,
then
we
wouldn't
care
about.
then
that
would
supply
whatever
defects
there
are
in
this
thing.
mr.
louis
henkin
but
--
yes,
sir,
the
--
mr.
louis
henkin
no
--
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
no,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
i
don't
know.
we
don't
need
that,
sir,
but
--
mr.
louis
henkin
--
the
commissioner
can
say
i
believe
from
the
police
commissioner
didone
that
he
got
a
tip,
but
does
that
enough
to
make
a
probable
cause
that
the
search
was
illegal?
mr.
louis
henkin
he
may
have,
sir,
he
may
have
found
out
who
is
your
informant
and
have
you
ask
them
these
following
questions,
he
may
have,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
well,
it's
not
--
didone
--
didone
said
i've
got
a
tip
from
x
on
that
--
that
fellow
said
on
many
occasions.
that
doesn't
go
to
didone's
credibility.
we're
not
questioning
didone's
credibility.
mr.
louis
henkin
the
purpose
of
the
warrant,
sir,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
is
for
the
magistrate
to
be
able
to
make
that
decision
probable
cause
that
there
is
a
need
to
evade
the
privacy
of
a
dwelling.
we
don't
believe
that
he
ought
to
be
able
to
do
that
on
an
affidavit
of
a
statement
by
a
police
officer
who
got
it
from
some
other
person
without
anymore,
without
any
--
there
are
cases,
sir,
where
--
where
on
the
same
facts,
the
police
normally
don't
do
this.
mr.
louis
henkin
that
may
still
not
be
enough,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
we
think
so,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
we
don't
think
so,
sir,
unless
as
mr.
justice
bradley
says
in
the
--
in
that
case
we
cite
on
the
note,
unless
--
at
least
there
were
an
affidavit
from
--
this
man
didn't
say
it's
under
oath.
and
if
he
--
and
if
he's
going
to
make
statements
about
the
apartment
not
under
oath,
he
can
make
them
--
he
--
he
can
fill
it
all
that
he
tells
he
wants
to.
if
one
is
going
to
fabricate
a
story,
well,
he
can
fabricate
it.
but
if
--
if
you
please,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
there's
another
point
in
this
thing.
it
isn't
only
the
lack
of
reliability
that
we're
concerned
with.
when
you
have
just
a
tip,
think
of
the
dangers
of
mistake.
the
man
said
apartment
36,
maybe
he
said
63.
maybe
he
said
35.
and
on
the
basis
of
this
alone,
you
go
to
a
particular
apartment
and
in
this
case
the
police
go.
they
don't
even
identify
themselves,
as
we
show
in
our
brief.
they
go
into
this
apartment,
knock
on
the
door
and
break
in
just
on
the
basis
that
this
man
is
not
only
reliable
after
his
tip
but
perfectly
accurate
in
the
information
he
gave
us.
if
the
police
had
done
in
this
case
what
they
do
normally,
sir,
which
is
--
there
are
cases
all
the
time,
there's
the
murphy
case
under
the
district
of
columbia
this
past
summer.
what
they
do
all
the
time
is
to
--
to
send
somebody
out
there
with
marked
money,
get
an
agent
as
a
purchaser.
there
was
no
indication
of
urgency
in
this
case,
sir.
the
fellow
had
said
it's
been
going
on
for
a
long
time.
they
will
be
there
tomorrow
and
a
day
after.
my
time
is
up,
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir,
because
we
believe
that
the
third
issue
which
is
whether
this
warrant
is
properly
executed.
mr.
louis
henkin
well
--
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir,
but
--
mr.
louis
henkin
but
our
objection
on
the
section
3109
in
our
third
--
up
--
third
part
of
our
case
applies
even
if
the
warrant
is
out.
if
--
in
order
to
execute
a
valid
warrant,
you
have
to
give
warning,
give
notice
of
your
presence
before
you
break
in.
and
we
submit
that
what
the
police
did
in
this
case
did
not
give
a
notice
required
by
the
statute
and
that
even
if
you
take
their
version
of
it,
that
is
the
truth,
that
is
the
truth.
and
in
any
event,
there's
a
--
an
obvious
mistake
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
the
government
admits
and
which
the
dissenting
judge
admits
as
to
whether
the
facts
were
found
in
favor
of
the
police
on
circumstances
where
it's
not
entirely
clear
that
the
fact
should
be
found
in
favor
of
the
police
because
after
all,
the
police
know
the
rule
and
had
an
interest
in
saying
they
have
complied
with
it.
no
indication
that
jones
even
knew
about
section
3109.
he
had
no
reason
to
falsify
the
execution.
no
--
no
indication
that
his
counsel
even
knew
it
because
it
wasn't
raised
until
we
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
by
a
different
counsel.
mr.
louis
henkin
so,
in
--
in
any
event,
sir,
you
would
--
even
if
you
find
that
the
warrant
was
valid
and
issue
a
probable
cause,
the
court
would
still
have
to
consider
whether
it
was
properly
executed
in
terms
of
section
3109.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
thank
you
very
much,
sir.
mr.
louis
henkin
thank
you,
sir.
the
assignment
of
the
court
below
was
to
my
co-counsel.
he
was
--
mr.
louis
henkin
--
unfortunately
ill
but
i
had
to
argue
this
case.
