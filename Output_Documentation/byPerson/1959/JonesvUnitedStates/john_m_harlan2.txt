justice
john
m.
harlan
you
read
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
in
both
--
are
in
both
agreement,
is
that
the
whole
statement
(inaudible)if
we
reach
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
that.
you
mean
if
everything
you
say,
talking
about
the
record
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
that
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
before
the
rule.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
do
you
claim
that
the
standing
rule
ought
to
be
done
away
with
entirely
in
the
sense
that
if
a
man
is
on
trial
and
evidence
is
introduced
against
him,
is
that
in
and
of
itself
enough
to
give
him
standing
to
make
the
motion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
have
to
go
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
far
in
this
case.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
your
view,
i
take
it,
if
this
man
had
never
--
not
been
in
the
premises
at
the
time,
it
would
have
been
sufficient
form
to
simply
go
in,
in
view
of
the
nature
of
this
charge,
and
said
this
evidence
had
been
illegally
seized
period,
and
that
would
be
enough.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
consistent
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
taking
the
position
that
he
did.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
at
least
he
got
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
he's
got
a
third
right
under
the
constitution
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
(voice
overlap)
to
say
nothing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
your
--
your
formula
would
require
him
to
say
what
would
incriminate
him.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
for
the
purposes
of
this
motion
only,
i
assert
that
these
are
my
narcotics,"
would
that
have
done
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
perhaps
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
perhaps,
to
be
qualified,
that
the
way
i
suggest
is
it
can
be
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
that
satisfy
your
requirement
of
standing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
to
go
the
whole
end.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
not
correct
in
thinking
that
particularly
in
these
narcotic
places,
it's
very
rare
to
see
a
name
of
an
informant
given
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
a
--
an
affidavit
for
a
warrant
in
either
arrest
or
search?
justice
john
m.
harlan
used
to
be
there.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
just
say
as
to
the
(inaudible)
question
in
connection
with
this
point
of
the
case,
namely,
that
there
was
a
dispute
(inaudible)
the
police,
how
they
got
in.
that's
never
been
tried
out.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
agree
with
judge
bazelon
that
the
majority
urged
in
that
respect
was
saying
that
it
was
determined
by
the
lower
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
your
brief
says
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
wasn't
determined?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
you
get
to
that
issue,
i
suppose
the
case
should
have
to
be
sent
back
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
unless
--
unless
your
point
that
they
didn't
raise
it
below
and
therefore,
it
can't
be
raised
on
appeal,
etcetera.
this
is
a
little
different
from
the
agnello
case
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
your
practical
answer
to
that
would
be
that
it's
not
a
very
strong
point.
