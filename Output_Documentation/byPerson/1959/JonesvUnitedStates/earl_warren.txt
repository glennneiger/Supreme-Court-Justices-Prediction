a

well,
to

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
henkin,
i
understand
that
you
are
representing
this
man
as
an
indigent
defendant
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
without
any
compensation
and
--
through
assigment
by
the
court
of
appeals
below.
and
i
would
like
to
express
appreciation
of
the
court
to
you.
you're
very
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
able
and
very
--
on
this
matter
in
which
you
--
you
represented.
so
it's
--
comfort
the

to
know
that
members
of

will
undertake
assignments
like

in
the
administration
of

we
thank
you.

we
appreciate
your

earnest,
able
manner
in
which
you
have
represented
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
this
matter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
it
would
serve
no
purpose
to
start
the
next
case.
we
would
only
have
--
have
minutes
unless
counsel
insists
on
starting
at
this
time,
we'll
--
we
will
carry
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
