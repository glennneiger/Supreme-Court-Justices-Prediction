now,
my
occupancy
of
the
property
(inaudible)
more
than
more
the
mere
presence
in
the
apartment,
don't
you?
justice

stewart
--
justice

stewart
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice

that
was
on
the
original
motion?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
the
man
who
came
to
dinner.
justice

stewart
your
argument
here
is
to
find
that
he's
in
possessory
crime
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
this
--
this
aspect,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
sit
down,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
have
a
question
to
you.
you

the
end
of
your
argument
for
obvious
reasons
for
organization,
the
--
the
basic
question
of
the
validity
of
this
search
and
seizure.

the
court
should
decide
that
the
search
and
seizure
was
not
invalid,
then
we
would
never
reach
your
standing
question
at
all,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
including
both
the
execution
and
the
carrying
out
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart

mean
the
--
both
the
--
both
the
sufficiency
of

of
the
affidavit
to
support
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
warrant
and
the
carrying
of
a
doubt.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
on
that
basis
that
judge
bazelon
dissented
probably.
