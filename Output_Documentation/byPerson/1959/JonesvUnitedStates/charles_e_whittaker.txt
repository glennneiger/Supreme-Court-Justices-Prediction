justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
(voice
overlap)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
might
act
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
could
you
instead
leave
that
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
very
frankly,
not
merely
the
renewal
of
the
pleading
filed
in
the
defendant
motion?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
thank
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
wonder
if
he
has
to
make
any
statement
at
all
about
the
matter
of
ownership
or
is
he
not
entitled
in
such
case
to
make
this
claim
to
sustain
this
motion
unless
he
affirms
that
we
disclaim
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
there
be
any
on
the
possession
point
alone?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
doesn't
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
it
have
to
be
such
as
would
be
competent
as
testimony?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
is
so,
is
it
not,
on
the
last
paragraph
of
officer
--
by
jones'
affidavit
on
record
3,
the
statement
that
the
cause
decision
(inaudible)
in
the
open
paragraph
is
giving
information
that
we
understand
our
pleading
of
the
case
and
which
was
correct?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
have
anymore
jury
to
think
on
the
--
the
affidavit
you're
citing
that
the
person
or
a
known
narcotics
users
through
this
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
the
federal
warrant?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
both
we
aforementioned,
persons
are
familiar
to
the
undersigned.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
followed
to
then,
to
the
next
sentence
both
has
committed
to
the
use
of
narcotics
--
narcotic
drugs
and
explained
either
marked
as
evidence
are
the
same?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
--
this
--
i
am
correct
in
believing
that
this
motion
to
suppress
attack
this
affidavit
and
warrant
for
defects
on
its
face?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
correct
in
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
do
you
say
about
this?
the
informant
who
have
been
found
at
least
active
if
not
trustworthy
before
says
to
the
agent,
"i
bought
narcotics
at
this
place
and
these
people
many
times.
i
was
there
last
night
and
i
bought
narcotics
from
them.
you
go
there
and
you'll
find
them
under
the
pillow,
on
the
dresser,
or
on
the
window
ledge."
now,
is
that
enough
report
of
magistrate
to
justify
the
issuance
of
this
warrant?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
--
and
what
--
then
sharpens
right
down
to
the
plain
point
of
the
brief
that
that
argument
--
that
in
his
possession,
for
instance,
or
the
(inaudible)
of
possession
which
the
government
has
to
prove
(inaudible)
whether
or
it's
involved
automatically
that
the
defendant
then
has
standing
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
would
it
--
you
don't
insist
that
he
talk,
do
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understand
your
last
argument
is
that
he
--
he
make
keep
still
but
he
can't
go
hot
and
cold.
he
can't
say,
“i
--
it's
not
mine
and
that
it
is
mine.”
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
knapp,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
enlighten
me
on
this?
i
believe
you
agreed
this
question
is
here.
the
--
the
petitioner
sought
to
suppress
this
evidence
a
pot
of
gram
that
it
had
been
illegally
obtained
and
the
warrant
to
stand
on
its
face.
judge
laws
held
that
he
didn't
have
to
do
any
of
that
because
the
man
had
no
standing
to
raise
it.
and
some
influence
has
brought
to
that
issue
by
this
man,
this
petitioner's
statement
of
the
fact
that
these
were
not
his
goods.
now,
let
me
ask
you.
would
a
determination
then
of
standing
based
on
that
issue
of
whether
or
not
they
were
his
goods
have
amounted
in
effect
to
a
trial
of
the
case
on
the
merits?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
in
order
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
if
in
order
to
(inaudible)
that
he
didn't
have
standing
that
had
to
be
in
determination
if
they
were
not
his
goods,
then
isn't
that
the
issue
on
the
trial
on
the
merits
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
that
they
were
not
his
goods,
he
were
in
possession
and
this
is
a
crime
of
possession.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
how
do
you
answer
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
government
says,
“you're
not
in
position,
mr.
jones,
to
raise
this
question.
here,
you
have
a
standing
for
you
said
the
goods
aren't
yours."
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
if
a
determination
is
to
be
made
of
that
issue
on
that
point,
then
that's
to
determine
the
merits
of
the
case
because
if
that
point
is
proved
and
brought
back,
he
couldn't
be
guilty
of
--
of
--
in
the
offense
alleged
in
the
indictment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
--
the
way
(inaudible)
it,
don't
you
answer
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
think
he's
got
permission
at
least
to
focus
up
to
the
point
on
the
merits
in
mr.
henkin's
argument
that
in
the
possession,
he
may
have
this
right
of
standing
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
realized
that
this
has
not
made
(inaudible)
of
this
distinction
but
we
argue
that
they
ought
to,
i
mean
urge
us
to
do
so.
now,
should
we?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
only
if
he
were
charged
with
unlawful
possession
of
the
gun.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
would
there
be
any
reason
why
a
commissioner
or
a
magistrate
might
say
to
the
officer,
“i
won't
insist
that
you
put
the
man's
name
in
the
affidavit,
but
you
tell
me
who
he
is,
i
want
to
know
something
about
his
reliability?”
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
don't
know
these
things
to
prevent
it,
do
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
was
presented
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
was
presented
to
the
lower
court,
was
it?
there
was
only
one
motion
was
denied
and
that's
this
motion
which
had
talked
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit
and
warrant
on
its
face,
isn't
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
that
you
wanted
to
preserve
the
point.
though,
you
should
raise
it
and
try
it
in
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
trial
court
in
this
situation.
