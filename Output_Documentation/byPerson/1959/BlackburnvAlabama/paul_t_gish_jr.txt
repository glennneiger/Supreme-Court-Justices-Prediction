mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
associate
justices.
first
of
all
before
i
get
into
my
formal
argument,
i
would
like
to
discuss
some
of
the
points
that
had
been
raised
in
mr.
hobbs'
argument.
it
is
our
position
that
there
never
was
a
judicial
determination
of
insanity
in
this
case.
the
only
judicial
determination
was
that
made
by
the
jury
when
they
convicted
him
of
this
crime.
now,
the
procedure
and
the
petitioner
tends
an
adjudication
if
a
statutory
procedure
in
alabama
by
which
the
trial
judge
if
he
has
reason
to
do
so,
may
have
a
prisoner
examined
by
physicians.
if
those
physicians
are
of
opinion
that
the
prisoner
maybe
insane
or
if
they
feel
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
is
insane,
they
shall
inform
the
judge.
then
the
judge
may
under
our
statute,
title
15,
section
428
alabama
code
40,
he
may
send
this
prisoner
to
be
examined
at
the
alabama
state
hospital,
the
insane
hospital.
then
still
under
this
statutory
procedure,
a
commission
maybe
appointed
as
was
appointed
in
this
case
and
may
make
a
report
to
the
circuit
judge
as
to
their
opinion
concerning
the
mental
condition
of
the
prisoner.
now,
this
old
procedure
as
i
have
stated
is
statutory.
there
is
no
adjudication
involved
except
there
are
--
is
a
statutory
provision
for
these
orders
to
be
made
by
the
court
ordering
the
petitioner
sent
to
the
insane
hospital
and
ordering
him
back
for
trial.
now,
for
supreme
court
of
alabama,
in
the
case
of
benton
against
state
1872
has
held
that
this
procedure
--
procedure
is
not
a
judicial
determination.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
i
believe
so,
yes
sir.
the
admissibility
in
that
case,
in
blackburn
case,
the
admissibility
of
this
report
into
evidence
was
the
point
and
hopefully
the
report
was
not
admissible
as
the
court
stated
in
the
absence
that
it
was
not
a
judicial
determination
and
was
mere
hearsay.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
benton.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
b-e-n-t-o-n
against
state,
it's
at
1872,
428.
now,
as
i
have
just
stated,
the
report
of
the
lunacy
commission
are
now
the
decisions
are
not
admissible
into
evidence.
now,
the
report
is
included
in
the
record
here
because
in
answer
to
their
position
the
report
was
a
test
as
an
exhibit
to
the
answers
to
interrogatory.
that
is
the
only
way
we
to
have
it
adjudged
and
had
the
benefit
of
the
report
as
the
matter
of
record.
mr.
hobbs
had
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
only
evidence
on
voir
dire
as
to
the
condition
under
which
the
confession
was
given
was
stated
by
the
deputy
sheriff
that
here
is
the
only
evidence.
and
that
is
true
yet
it
only
came
to
in
chief
that
the
defendant
did
testify
this
was
after
the
confession
had
been
ruled
admissible.
the
defendant
then
both
--
the
jury
took
the
stand
and
testified
that
he
was
insane
at
that
time
and
then
he
didn't
remember
anything
about
the
questioning
of
the
answers
which
he
gave.
i'm
merely
bringing
that
out
to
point
out
that
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
this
defendant
from
taking
that
position
on
voir
dire.
and
while
introducing
that
evidence
at
the
time
he
now
claim
--
claims
that
his
right
of
the
protection
of
due
process
were
violated
and
i
have
been
handling
the
case
that
would
given
the
jury
to
over
(inaudible)
the
only
evidence
introduced
by
the
petitioner
on
voir
dire
was
the
two
doctors'
definition
who
strongly
stated
that
the
petitioner
was
insane.
then,
our
own
propositions
that
one
other
point,
the
petitioner
admits
that
that
was
relay
questioning
or
sustained
questioning
of
this
petitioner.
now,
i
haven't
seen
a
case
of
this
court
under
these
circumstances
under
eight
or
nine
hour
questioning
with
a
break
of
--
with
the
answers
and
the
statement
being
taken
out
in
long
hand
by
deputy
sheriff
who
to
say
the
least
was
not
an
accomplished
ground.
i
have
never
seen
a
case
of
this
court
which
held
that
under
those
circumstances
that
the
length
of
the
questioning
would
render
him
voluntarily
confession.
there
is
also
an
intimation
that
this
petitioner
was
questioned
by
more
than
one
law
enforcement
officer.
i
believe
the
record
will
show
that
the
answer
of
the
deputy
sheriff
was
to
the
effect
that
i'd
--
in
the
questioning
out
was
there
all
attack
that
is
out
with
question
on
cross
examination
was
anyone
else
there.
it
takes
years
the
sheriff
and
another
deputy
were
in
and
out.
did
they
questioned
the
petitioner,
his
answer
was
that
they
may
have
but
the
import
of
the
whole
thing
as
i
read
the
record,
wouldn't
this
man's
standing
was
conducting
this
investigation
was
questioning
further
here
that
that
these
other
gentlemen
were
not.
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
harlan
had
asked
mr.
hobbs
about
lucid
intervals,
about
the
doctor's
testimony
concerning
that.
all
three
doctors,
who
made
up
this
commission,
testified
that
blackburn
did
have
lucid
intervals.
dr.
richards'
deposition
shows
that
he
was
of
the
opinion,
that
the
man
was
not
--
but
the
other
two
doctor's
answers
revealed
that
they
also
think
that
at
least
some
other
time
that
his
mind,
was
normal.
dr.
rowe
says
that
during
his
stay
in
state
hospital,
he
was
--
his
mind
was
more
normal
than
abnormal.
a
question
has
been
asked
concerning
the
other
evidence
connecting
this
petitioner
with
the
crime.
and
i
agree
with
mr.
hobbs
that
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
convict
this
man
of
the
other
evidence
the
state
has
shown.
however,
there
was
more
evidence
than
--
than
mr.
hobbs
stated.
in
addition
to
the
buick
automobile,
maroon
in
color
which
was
seen
by
the
rolling
store
at
the
time
the
crime
was
in
illinois
(inaudible).
it
was
shown
that,
some
one
or
two
days
before
the
crime
was
committed
that
the
operator
of
this
rolling
store
stopped
at
a
house
at
which
the
petitioner
was
staying
and
that
questions
were
asked
by
the
petitioner
and
by
his
friend
concerning
the
trips,
concerning
the
number
of
times
that
the
rolling
store
passed
that
way
and
that
the
--
and
when
the
rolling
store
would
be
back
again.
now
in
the
confession
itself,
the
petitioner
states
that
he
and
his
friends
from
illinois
didn't
have
the
money
to
get
back
to
illinois
and
that
they
robbed
the
rolling
store
for
that
purpose
to
obtain
those
cars.
now,
after
this
court
remanded
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama
that
court
treated
of
the
petitioner's
claim
as
being
two-fold.
they
said
that
the
petitioner
claims
his
confession
was
obtained
by
sustained
questioning.
second,
that
the
petitioner
claims
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
he
confessed.
on
the
first
proposition
concerning
his
sustained
questioning
as
we've
already
discussed
the
entire
evidence
in
that
regard
was
the
evidence
of
the
deputy
sheriff
to
obtain
the
confession.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
circumstances
surrounding
of
the
giving
of
the
confession,
did
not
amount
to
those
coercions
that
this
court
has
held
violate
the
process
and
we
take
that
of
course
on
no
conflict
in
the
evidence
in
that
regard.
there
was
only
one
man
to
testify
in
that
regard.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
nine
hours
of
questioning
with
an
hour
of
break
during
that
time
(inaudible)
on
the
statement
by
the
person
who
was
doing
that
job
in
wrong
hands
that
it
was
not
an
accomplice
scribe,
did
not
file
for
a
due
process.
now,
as
in
the
order
for
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes.
it
was
the
deputy
sheriff.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
said
that
he
was
not
an
accomplice
(inaudible)
had
glean
that
from
raging
the
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
that's
right
--
uncharged
and
i
imagine
one
in
for
us
were
either
in
the
word
from
his
--
the
manner
in
which
his
statement
(inaudible).
now
on
the
other
point
that
is
discussed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
on
the
claim
filed
by
the
petitioner
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
confession,
the
court
of
appeals
had
pointed
out
by
mr.
hobbs,
said
that
there
is
conflict
of
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
regard.
they're
being
in
conflict
of
evidence,
the
court
appeals
held
into
--
in
the
absence
of
the
trial
judge
who
had
witnesses
and
the
petitioner
before
was
in
a
better
position
to
decide
in
that
coercion
than
with
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
states
it
as
problem.
they
say,
“when
confession
are
admitted
on
the
controverted
questions
of
fact,
this
court
will
not
revise
the
rulings
of
the
lower
court
admitting
now
unless
if
he
can
manifest
the
wrong,
leaving
a
vast
discretion
with
the
trial
judge.”
now,
that
statement
is,
i
submit
sentimental
to
the
statement
of
this
court
in
lisenba
against
california
where
this
court
held
that
if
it
will
accept
defining
of
the
local
court
on
controverted
questions
of
fact,
unless
such
findings
are
not
supported
by
evidence
and
would
of
--
and
the
acceptance
of
--
to
find
it
was
worthy,
worthy
on
--
then
it
didn't
--
law
with
due
process.
now,
as
to
the
conflict
in
the
evidence
of
these
doctors
as
i've
stated
their
reports
in
only
in
the
evidence
as
an
exhibit
to
their
depositions,
all
three
doctors
of
the
commission
are
answered
interrogatory
definitely,
dr.
tarwater
is
the
--
he,
in
of
the
alabama
state
hospital
system.
he
stated,
he
was
a
member
on
this
commission
and
he
stated
that
he
(inaudible)
this
petitioner
approximately
four
or
five
times.
that
was
during
the
period
of
about
four
years.
he
stated
that,
about
two
and
a
half
hours
would
cover
the
entire
period
of
his
observation
of
the
petitioner
and
yet,
he
is
given
test
on
morning
which
is
more
strongly
of
the
three
to
the
effect
that
this
man
is
insane.
dr.
rowe
whose
title
i
believe
is
assistant
director
of
the
state
hospital
system
in
fact
the
he
in
of
the
hospital
where
the
petitioner
was
held.
in
other
way,
he
is
more
of
an
administrative
man
than
he
is
a
resident
doctor.
he
states
that
in
his
petition,
about
twice
a
week
and
then
some
of
his
observations
were
merely
seeing
on
general
ward
around.
dr.
richards
was
a
resident
physician
testified
that
the
petitioner
was
known,
and
his
answer
showed
that
he
didn't
see
the
petitioner
“often”
with
that
--
that's
the
only
--
he
didn't
say,
“i
didn't
see
him
often.”
i
don't
know
whether
that
means
off
for
the
week
or
off
(inaudible)
often
a
year.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
he
testified
at
first
--
is
on
page
80.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
of
--
let
me
see
this
--
on
page
81
i
believe.
i
--
and
in
interrogatory
number
one
at
the
top
of
page
81,
the
doctor
richards
stated
that
during
that
period
of
time
he
personally
observed
jesse
blackburn
from
the
time
he
came
in
until
the
time
he
left
this
hospital.
and
then
interrogatory
number
two,
give
the
time
from
the
beginning
of
the
observation
of
jesse
blackburn
and
that
they
he
would
last
see
him
observed
by
you
about
three
and
half
years.
so,
the
doctor
has
stated
that
he
observed
the
petitioner
during
his
whole
stay
at
the
state
hospital.
now,
on
page
--
pages
82
and
83
of
the
record
are
the
answers
to
in
our
inventories
on
cross
examination
under
which,
it
is
our
opinion
that
dr.
richards
is
stating
that
this
petitioner
was
seen
during
his
entire
stay
and
he
states
categorically
that
his
mental
condition
was
normal
on
april
19th,
1948
which
was
the
date
of
the
crime
and
that
his
mental
condition
was
good.
on
may
8,
1948
which
was
the
date
of
the
confession.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes?
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
it
is
our
position
sir,
that
these
are
--
are
commitments
to
the
alabama
--
excuse
me
sir,
you
want
me
to
answer
you
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
alright.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
justice
whittaker,
before
the
recess
you
had
asked
--
just
asked
me
a
question
concerning
exhibit
c.
it's
found
on
page
44
of
the
record.
your
question
concerned
the
recital
in
this
exhibit,
that
this
man,
blackburn
had
been
declared
insane
by
the
circuit
court
of
mobile
county.
as
i
understand,
this
procedure
in
the
state
of
alabama,
the
prisoner
is
found
after
examination
by
usually
the
local
doctors
and
they
report
to
the
trial
judge,
and
the
trial
judge
then
may
under
our
statute
which
is
title
15,
section
420
(a)
through
the
court
order
of
alabama
in
1940.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
it
does,
sir,
it
does.
it
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
it
has
been
so
held
in
benton
against
state,
187
so.
2d.
428
and
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
find
during
recess
that
i
was
in
error
for
stating
to
you
the
then
case
is
in
my
brief,
it
is
not.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
187
so.
2d.
428.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
428.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
all
right.
then
in
another
case,
in
our
supreme
court
--
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon,
this
is
in
our
court
of
appeals,
the
court
held
that
the
testimony
of
the
doctors
who
made
up
the
lunacy
commission
may
be
received
in
evidence
without
violation
of
due
process
of
law.
now,
that
case
is
hunt
against
state
in
277
so.
2d.
186.
now,
that,
you
see,
is
a
procedure
that
was
followed
here.
the
report
of
the
lunacy
commission
could
not
be
received
in
evidence
because
our
court
held
that
it
was
hearsay.
however,
the
testimony
of
the
doctors
following
the
lunacy
commission
could
be
received
into
evidence
and
would
present
any
definite
issue
of
fault.
now,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
hobbs
that
if
we
only
look
to
the
formal
report
laid
by
the
commission,
this
man
would
undoubtedly
be
insane
in
all
the
evidence.
however,
we
have
one
doctor,
dr.
richards,
as
i've
stated
who
i
submit
the
--
of
his
evidence
of
the
--
of
his
answers
are
to
the
effect
that
this
man
was
normal
(inaudible)
he
was
in
hospital
was
normal
on
the
days
of
the
trial,
and
he
was
normal
on
the
date
that
he
gave
his
confession.
now,
since
there
is
that
conflict
as
between
the
doctors
or
among
the
doctors
on
the
commission
and
since
we
have
the
testimony
of
the
deputy
sheriff
who
--whose
testimony
is
in
conflict
with
saying
this
man
was
insane.
and
since
this
man
was
before
the
trial
court,
i
submit
that
this
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
about
blackburn
is
--
is
squarely
based
that
they
are
right
when
they
say
that
the
trial
court
was
in
a
better
position,
and
they
want
to
decide
this
matter
and
since
the
evidence
was
conflicting,
then
