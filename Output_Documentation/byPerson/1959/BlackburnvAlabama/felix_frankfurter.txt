how
could
we
tell
what
took
place
with
reference
to
that
judgment
if
the
issue
wasn't
raised,
wasn't
passed
on,
wasn't
contested,
wasn't
even
raised
here?
how
can
we
assume
that
that
--
that
that
was
an
adjudication
still
outstanding
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
give
us
any
light
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
think
it
was
validated
on
ground
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
state
action
–
the
plea
wasn't
put
in
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
the
answer
is
pretty
plain
that
we
don't
reverse
the
state
court
for
the
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
the
violation
hasn't
been
charged,
hasn't
been
canvassed,
hasn't
been
passed
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
know
what
other
things
there
might
be
in
the
record
because
it
introduces
--
there
were
not
being
relevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
you
base
your
petition
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
you
base
your
argument
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
ask
an
adjudication
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
all
over
--
it
sounded
anywhere
on
this
room?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
(inaudible)
is
sound
as
anybody
in
this
room
you
would
make
the
claim
on
which
you
came
here,
namely
that
the
confession
was
obtained
under
the
circumstances
that
invalidate
the
submission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
you'll
--
maybe
–
there
maybe
many
reasons
why
you
didn't
raise
it,
or
why
it
wasn't
raised,
maybe
that
is
still
not
an
adjudicated
issue
in
this
court
that
a
state
can
execute
an
insane
person.
i
express
my
opinion,
but
the
court
hasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
--
and
formerly
speculate
about
that
so
we
have
started
to
go
on.
i
suppose
you're
welcome
and
hope
you
will?[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
did
the
questioning,
mr.
hobbs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
simply
or
continuously?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
burden
enabling
(inaudible)
his
time,
was
it?
he
did
most
of
the
questioning?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
the
room
was
the
size
of
a
closet?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
i
wasn't
--
but
i
don't
--
what
--
what
was
the
hour
of
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
to
six
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
with
an
interruption
of
an
hour?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then,
from
seven
to
11?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
of
--
what
are
the
dates
--
what
are
the
dates
of
those
text
books?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hear
about
a
--
i
hear
in
the
deal
of
the
changes
taking
place
if
the
schizophrenic
treatment
as
a
result
of
therapeutic
improvement.
i
don't
know
whether
those
are
anymore
(inaudible)
than
what
you
read?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hobbs,
you
say
to
release,
you
want
this
court
to
release
this
man?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
the
release?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
suppose
so.
i
suppose
that
the
usual
thing
in
conformity
with
this
at
opinion
that
--
then
make
it
under
state
law
for
retrial,
i
think
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
third
edition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
put
the
burden
on
you
working
out
normally
among
all
the
writers
on
the
subject.
