justice
charles
e.
whittaker
under
the
law,
may
i
ask
the
bringing
the
adjudication
of
mr.
blackburn
(inaudible)
the
circuit
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
was
determined
more
than
the
(inaudible)
of
that
fact
that
it
wasn't
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
hobbs,
i
don't
understand
the
opinion.
you
said,
this
was
the
first
adjudication
he
had
ever
had
of
his
insanity.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
adjudication
are
you
referring
to,
the
one
but,
jury
in
the
criminal
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
never
was,
as
i
understood,
a
separate
hearing
to
determine
sanity
in
the
ordinary
sense.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understand
now.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
may
i
ask
you
this,
mr.
hobbs?
this
is
troubling
me,
as
a
matter
of
law
if
you
have
a
judgment
of
a
state
court,
a
judging
the
man
to
be
of
unsound
mind
that
judgment
stands,
does
it
not,
until
it's
vacated
by
legal
proceedings
and
resulting
in
a
judgment
to
the
contrary?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that
just
the
ex
parte
statement
of
the
doctor,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no
judgment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
would
just
seem
to
me
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
ignore
the
existence
of
a
final
judgment
determining
insanity
so
long
at
it
stands
that
fact
is
determined,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
record
6?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
is
no
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
makes
no
effort
to
conform
with
judicial
or
procedural
due
process.
no
notice
service
hearing?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
isn't
it
more
or
if
there's
a
judgment
outstanding
saying
that
the
man
was
insane,
until
that
judgment
set
aside
under
your
law,
you
cannot
trial
an
insane
man,
can
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he's
not
fit
for
trial,
that's
the
law,
isn't
it
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
wouldn't
we
have
to,
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
we
found
that
this
--
the
record
show
the
judgment
declaring
a
man
insane
and
that
it
was
still
outstanding.
if
we
were
confronted
with
that
situation
even
after
a
plea
of
guilty
on
the
2255
motion,
would
have
to
set
aside,
as
the
illegal,
wouldn't
we?
in
other
words,
wouldn't
we
have
to
notice
this
as
plain
error
whether
raised
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
may
i
say,
and
before
you
do
it
if
i
may,
that's
my
understanding
that
a
legal
situation
such
as
the
judgment
at
least
one
shown
too
had
been
rendered
is
presumed
to
continue
until
the
contrary
appears.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
it
shows
in
the
record
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
understand,
you're
giving
up
any
points
however
though
that
deprived
of
his
constitutional
right
to
liberty.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
can't
resist
asking
you
again,
why
he
had
to
come
in
at
this
trial
and
prove
for
an
existing
judgment
already
established,
namely
his
insanity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
long
as
that
judgment
stood.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
hobbs,
would
you
bother
if
i
ask
you
now,
is
there
any
other
evidence
than
the
confession
linking
this
petitioner
to
this
crime?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
which
that
â€“
(inaudible)
insane.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
gish.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
a
few
questions?
in
reference
to
record
44,
do
--
where
this
particular
language
is
saying,
it
also
appears
to
the
court,
this
is
the
colbert
county
circuit
court
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
that
said
prisoner
has
been
declared
insane
by
the
circuit
court
of
mobile
county
on
the
alleged
offense
committed
in
that
jurisdiction
and
the
circuit
--
circuit
court
judge
of
that
jurisdiction
ordered
the
prisoner
returned
back
to
state
hospital
from
which
institution
he
had
escaped
and
while
on
escape,
is
alleged
to
have
committed
another
offense
namely
this
one.
now,
therefore,
it's
ordered
and
adjudged
and
decreed
that
the
prisoner
be
(inaudible)
by
permanently
committed
to
the
alabama
state
hospital
at
mt.
vernon
where
he
must
remain
until
restored
in
his
right
mind
et
cetera.
do
you
understand
that
those
--
neither
of
them
are
adjudications
of
insanity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
it
have
to
do
merely
with
the
district
trial
in
criminal
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
you
could
understand
this
is
not
to
be
an
adjudication
of
insanity.
