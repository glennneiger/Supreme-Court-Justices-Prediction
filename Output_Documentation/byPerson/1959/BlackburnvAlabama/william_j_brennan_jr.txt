justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
to
--
what
was
the
procedure
by
which,
as
i
understand
it,
five
years
later,
it
was
determined
that
he
was
now
sane
enough
to
stand
in
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
extent
of
remedy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
was
the
adjudication,
the
original
adjudication
and
the
adjudication
of
insanity,
as
of
the
date
of
the
commission
of
the
alleged
crime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
40,
41?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
what
i
have
in
mind
mr.
hobbs
was,
i
notice
that
in
38,
the
court
says,
it's
of
the
opinion
that
there's
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
the
defendant
was
insane
either
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
such
offense
or
at
the
present
time.
my
question
was,
whether
the
adjudication
improved
in
the
adjudication
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
you
told
us
it's
all
that
the
record
show
that
whether
or
not
he's
actually
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
doesn't
show
whether
there
was
a
matter
of
hours?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
hobbs,
i
guess
--
i
gather
--
i
correctly
understand
you,
before
to
say
that,
the
reason
on
alabama
procedure
which
after
there
has
been
an
adjudication
of
insanity
there
may
then
be
a
redetermination
and
an
adjudication
of
sanity?
in
other
words,
i
think
you
told
me
that,
he
stood
trial
on
the
basis
of
certification
of
some
doctors
of
the
mental
hospital
that
he
was
now
sane.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
there
has
been
no
formal
determination
of
sanity
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
is
no
procedure
now
none
of
those?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
were
not,
were
they,
the
same
doctors
who
made
the
formal
report,
that
you
referred
us
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
hobbs,
perhaps
the
same
question
justice
whittaker
asked
you,
of
whether
it
was
an
adjudication
of
insanity
as
of
the
time
of
the
offense
or
as
of
the
time
of
adjudication,
isn't
there
still
outstanding
without
being
vacated
a
formal
court
adjudication
of
insanity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
what
appears
at
7
and
8,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
doesn't
saying
anything
about
--
nothing
at
the
side?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
that
suggests
that
you
don't
have
the
fourteenth
amendment
question
before
us
on
the
premise
that
there
is
an
outstanding
form
for
adjudication
of
insanity,
with
was
that
outstanding
in
the
time
of
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
have
to
mr.
hobbs
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
the
hand
writing
of
the
questioning
officer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
catch
of
that
case
against
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
b-e-n-t-o-n.
