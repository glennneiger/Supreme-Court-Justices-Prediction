mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
associate
justices
of
the
court.
11
years
ago,
jesse
blackburn,
a
young
negro,
been
a
young
negro,
was
taken
into
custody
by
the
state
of
alabama
on
the
charge
of
robbery.
he
has
been
continuously
held
in
the
custody
of
alabama
from
that
date
to
this.
the
first
five
years,
he
was
detained
in
an
insane
asylum
in
the
state
of
alabama
under
the
adjudication
by
the
circuit
court
of
colbert
county,
that
he
was
insane.
for
the
last
six
years,
he
has
been
detained
in
prison
in
alabama
on
an
adjudication
by
the
circuit
court
of
colbert
county
that
he
was
not
insane.
if
this
seems
arbitrary
and
inconsistent,
we
think
the
facts
will
abundantly
show
that
it
is
just
that.
petitioner
was
before
this
court
at
the
1956
term,
seeking
the
reversal
of
his
conviction
on
the
ground
that
the
confession
upon
which
his
conviction
was
predicated
was
involuntary
and
hence
denied
him
the
due
process
of
law
guaranteed
to
all
persons
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
our
constitution.
this
court
vacated
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
courts
of
alabama
because
of
uncertainty
in
the
record
as
to
whether
the
courts
of
alabama
had
passed
upon
petitioner's
constitutional
rights.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeal
which
is
set
out
in
the
record,
makes
abundantly
clear
at
this
point,
that
the
courts
of
alabama
have
passed
upon
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioner
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
have
rejected
his
contentions
under
that
section
of
the
constitution.
the
conviction
and
sentence
imposed
by
the
circuit
court
of
colbert
county
on
petitioner
was
to
20
years
imprisonment.
the
facts
concerning
the
weight
that
this
confession
was
obtained,
came
entirely
from
the
deputy
sheriff
who
procured
the
confession.
this
was
necessarily
so
because
petitioner
was
--
jesse
blackburn
was
unable
to
recall
any
of
the
events
leading
up
to
his
arrest,
his
confinement
in
prison
and
indeed
for
some
months
or
years
after
he
was
committed
to
the
insane
asylum
in
alabama.
the
medical
records
of
this
petitioner
reveal
that,
he
had
already
had
a
determination
by
medical
doctors,
was
apart
of
his
record,
that
he
did
suffer
recurrently
from
prolonged
period
of
amnesia.
whether
this
was
the
reason
that
at
the
trial,
he
couldn't
recall
of
whether
it
was
the
treatment
given
him
in
the
hospital
in
alabama
which
as
you
know,
with
respect
to
schizophrenic,
frequently
include
shock
treatment
whether
that
was
the
reason
he
couldn't
recall
any
of
this
circumstances,
we
don't
know,
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
sole
testimony
did
come
from
the
deputy
sheriff.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
there
was,
your
honor.
that
the
--
the
circuit
judge
in
colbert
county
had
it
--
his
attention
--
called
to
the
fact
that
it
was
ground
for
believing
blackburn
was
insane.
he
then
called
two
local
doctors
in.
they
examined
him
and
--
and
indicated
that
they
agree
with
the
conclusion
that
there
was
probable
ground
for
believing
he
was
insane.
and
then
there
was
a
three
–
three-doctor
board
that
passed
on
his
sanity,
and
this
board
was
unanimously
of
the
opinion
that
he
was
insane.
following
this
determination
by
the
three-man-board,
there
was
a
formal
adjudication
by
the
circuit
court
that
he
was
insane
and
he
was
then
transmitted
to
mt.
vernon,
the
insane
hospital,
in
alabama
and
he
was
forcibly
detained
there,
as
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
he
escape
and
was
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
the
doctors,
the
hospital
--
the
insane
hospital
of
alabama
in
which
he
was
committed,
set
to
the
circuit
court
of
colbert
county
in
a
memorandum
to
the
effect
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
--
authorities
that
were
holding
him,
he
was
now
sufficiently
restored
his
sanity
to
stand
trial.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
let
me
--
let
me
refer
to
that
in
the
record.
at
page
38
of
the
record,
there
is
the
order
of
the
court
of
colbert
county,
committing
jesse
blackburn
to
the
alabama
state
hospital
for
observation
and
report.
now,
that
is
what
brought
in
to
operation
in
this
three-man-board.
on
page
44
of
the
record,
is
the
formal
adjudication
by
the
circuit
court
of
colbert
county
that
jesse
blackburn
be
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
--
placed
and
detained
in
the
asylum
until
restored
to
his
sanity.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
the
determination
by
the
three-man
sanity
board,
determined,
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
of
page
41,
that
is
from
the
report
of
the
three-man
medical
board,
they
said,
“it
is
the
opinion
of
each
of
us
and
our
opinion
jointly
and
collectively
that
the
said
jesse
blackburn
at
the
time
of
his
admission
to
state
hospital
on
july
29,
1938
was
insane
and
incompetent.
during
his
stay
in
the
hospital,
he
is
continued
to
exhibit
abnormal
thinking
and
abnormal
behavior
and
it's
our
opinion
that
he
is
presently
insane.
from
a
study
of
his
case
and
using
information
from
several
other
mental
hospitals
where
he
was
formally
--
where
he
was
formally
been
treated,
it
is
our
further
opinion
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
but
which
he
was
charged.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
then,
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
determination
by
the
medical
board
appointed
by
the
circuit
court
of
colbert
county
that
the
circuit
court
entered
this
formal
adjudication
committing
him
to
the
insane
asylum
of
alabama
and
he
remained
there
as
i
say
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
some
--
something
more
than
four
years,
yes.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
there
were
two
pleas,
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes
sir,
both.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
would
think
that,
that
would
be
--
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
a
sufficient
determination
for
placing
someone
in
detention,
that
he
was
insane
at
that
time,
the
order
of
the
--
the
candid,
i
don't
know
but
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
how
much
of
a
--
how
much
of
a
scope
--
how
much
scope
the
order
must
take.
but,
this
order
does
not
go
beyond
determination
that
he
is
insane,
yes.
now,
the
concern
it
is
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
a
little
bit
of
both,
i
think,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
know
that
it
would
be
entirely
accurate
to
say,
the
record
reveals
that
he
was
given
shock
treatment.
the
record
does
show
however,
that
he
was
--
he
gave
us
his
reason
for
fleeing
the
hospital
in
mt.
vernon,
the
fact
that
they
were
coming
in
to
give
him
shock
treatment.
and
he
was
later
caught
and
brought
back
to
the
mt.
vernon
hospital
and
i
think,
it's
a
fair
inference
that
it
is
not
revealed
whether
that
was
a
first
time
they
sought
to
give
him
that
--
if
--
the
doctor
was
taking
his
history
after
he
was
apprehended.
and
he,
it's
all
set
out
in
the
record
there
that
at
that
time
he
gave
his
reason
for
the
escape
that
he
--
that
they
were
trying
to
give
him
shock
treatment
and
he
didn't
want
it.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes
--
yes.
now,
under
the
deputy
sheriff's
testimony,
he
said
that,
he
began
his
question
of
jesse
blackburn
at
about
one
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
that
this
questioning
continued
in
--
uninterruptedly
until
six
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
and
they
stopped
then
about
an
hour
for
supper.
and
then
the
questioning
was
resumed
after
supper
and
continued
in
the
words
of
the
deputy
sheriff
until
10
or
11
o'clock
at
night.
so,
we
have
under
the
testimony
of
the
deputy
sheriff,
five
hours
was
sustained
grilling
of
interruption
for
supper
and
then
the
continuation
which
lasted
several
more
hours.
this
questioning
was
carried
on
in
a
room
about
the
size
of
a
closet,
four
feet
by
six
feet
or
six
feet
by
eight
feet.
the
deputy
sheriff
was
there
the
entire
time
and
two
other
law
enforcement
officers
were
coming
in
and
out
and
were
joining
in
the
questioning
from
time
to
time.
now,
such
a
confession
obtained
after
nine
or
10
hours
of
--
almost
constant
grilling
by
relays
of
law
enforcement
officers
would
be
a
doubtful
validity
we
submit,
even
if
jesse
blackburn
were
facing
abnormal
will
a
normal
man.
that
was
somewhat
a
paraphrase
of
the
statement
in
the
haley
case,
haley
against
state
of
ohio,
where
the
petitioner
had
been
grilled
for
some
five
hours
straight
and
was
a
15-year
old
boy
and
the
court
went
on
to
after
making
a
remark
that
that
five
hours
of
sustain
grilling
would
be
doubtful
validity
more
of
a
(inaudible)
years
and
normal
faculties,
it
then
went
on
say
it,
certainly
was
not
enough
for
a
person
of,
only
15
years
of
age.
well,
of
course
here,
the
disability
is
an
incapacity
of
jesse
blackburn
were
incomparably
greater
than
the
youth
in
the
haley
case
because
jesse
blackburn
has
spent
his
entire
adult
life
in
an
insane
asylum,
eight
years
at
the
time
of
his
trial.
he
had
--
he
started
off,
we've
picked
up
his
trail
in
the
army
and
he
was
surveyed
out
in
the
army
as
a
permanent
mental
defective
and
was
transferred
to
a
government
insane
hospital.
in
1944,
the
government
hospital,
appraised
him
at
50%
mentally
defective.
in
1946,
the
government
hospital
appraised
him,
as
a
100%
mentally
defective.
it
was
sometime,
in
1948,
that
he
was
temporarily
released
from
the
hospital
in
the
custody
of
his
sister
and
while
on
this
--
away
from
hospital
on
this
temporarily
release,
that
he
came
to
alabama
to
attend
the
funeral
of
his
brother.
it
was
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
chicago
i
believe,
illinois,
somewhere
in
illinois.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes
sir.
the
testimony
of
--
the
cross
examination
of
the
three
medical
doctors
on
the
insanity
board,
talks
principally
in
terms
of
a
--
has
he
had
lose
(inaudible),
has
he
had
--
has
had
been
coherent
from
time
to
time,
they
answer
those
questions
that
yes,
to
the
effect
that
he
had.
although
doctor
tarwater,
who
was
superintendent
of
all
the
mental
hospitals
in
alabama,
stated
that
for
several
months,
after
he
was
placed
in
the
custody
of
the
insane
asylum,
that
he
had
no
--
that
he
was
irrational
all
the
time
for
several
months.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
the
--
he
left
--
he
left
this
mental
hospital
in
illinois
with
a
determination
that
he
was
100%
mentally
defective.
he
was
picked
up
in
alabama
in
late
april
or
early
may
1948.
his
confession
was
obtained
on
may
8,
1948.
the
doctors
took
him
into
custody,
in
july,
approximately
two
months
after
his
confession
and
doctor
tarwater
testified
that
for
months
after
they
took
him
into
their
custody
that
he
had
no
rational
(inaudible)
at
all.
it
--
the
evidence
of
blackburn's
insanity
is
not
only
revealed
by
the
history
of
his
confinement
prior
to
his
arrest,
it
is
also
shown
by
the
events
that
took
place
immediately
following
his
arrest.
the
jailer,
who
generally
is
not
too
sensitive
to
mental
illnesses
of
--
of
his
guest,
determined
that
--
that
he
seemed
a
little
bit
crazy
to
him.
he
was
the
one
that
called
it
to
the
attention
of
the
circuit
judge.
every
person
that
has
ever
examined
this
man,
there
were
seven
doctors
that
had
been
appointed
by
the
state
of
alabama
to
examine
him,
everyone
one
of
them
has
concluded,
that
he
was
insane.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
your
honor,
it's
correct.
the
record
really
doesn't
show
them.
we
know
that
the
confession
was
may
8.
we
know
that,
between
may
8
and
july
26,
the
trial
judge
had
appointed
local
doctors
who
had
come
in
and
had
examined
him
twice
they
said,
we
don't
know
what
lapse
of
time
there
was
in
their
visits.
so,
we
can
say
that
it
was,
could
have
been
too
long
a
period
of
time
after
the
confession
but
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir
it
doesn't.
well,
i
think
--
i
think
he
does
say,
the
jailer
himself
says
that
he
was
asked
a
cross
examination,
if
he
didn't
notice
his
derangement
of
short
time
thereafter
and
he
said,
well
it
was
some
period
of
time
there.
but,
it
could
have
been
more
than
it
--
the
way
the
law
moves,
it
would
had
have
been
fairly
short
lived
thereafter
because
we
find
these
orders
from
the
circuit
judge
with
respect
to
it,
within
a
period
of
that
two
months.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes
sir
--
no
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
this
--
this
sanity
board
which
was
convened,
as
we've
stated
read
from
this
opinion
was
unanimous
that
blackburn
was
insane
at
the
time
they
examined
him
and
was
--
in
their
opinion
insane
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
so,
that
goes
back
and
covers
of
course
the
period
of
the
confession
itself.
we
mentioned
that
blackburn
after
he
was
put
in
mt.
vernon,
that
he
escaped
and
the
state
alabama
had
him
reexamined
after
his
escape
as
to
his
sanity.
two
doctors
again,
at
the
appointment
of
the
state
alabama
examined
him
and
they
were
unanimously
of
the
opinion,
the
two
of
them
that
he
was
insane.
that
diagnosis
appears
at
page
154
of
the
record.
their
diagnosis
is
schizophrenic,
reaction,
paranoid
type,
insane,
incompetent
and
should
be
place
on
an
insane
hospital.
that's
at
first
full
paragraph
on
page
154
of
the
record.
based
on
this
diagnosis
of
the
medical
doctors,
the
circuit
court
of
mobile
county
formerly
adjudicated
jesse
blackburn
insane
and
that
appears
in
the
record.
so,
we
have
it
as
i
say
the
determination
by
seven
doctors
appointed
by
the
state
of
alabama,
that
this
man
was
insane.
he
went
to
the
--
was
kept
in
the
hospital
for
some
four
and
half
years,
the
mental
hospital
on
the
basis
of
that
determination.
this
was
the
phase,
the
adjudication
of
sanity
that
this
man
had
ever
had
and
it
was
the
one
that
sent
him
out
to
prison
for
20
years,
on
the
basis
of
this
solely
as,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
on
the
basis
of
this
confession,
which
he
gave
at
the
time
when
all
medical
opinion
agreed
that
he
was
insane.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no
sir.
the
--
the
jury
--
the
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
--
and
they
--
they
said
he
was
and
that's
the
only
time
anybody
--
no
medical
opinion
has
ever
suggested
that
he
was
insane
with
the
exception
of
the
testimony
of
dr.
richards,
which
we'll
reach
in
a
moment.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
none
other
than
that.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
yes
sir.
the
--
the
petitioner
can
seek
the
restoration
in
the
civil
rights
and
so
forth.
i
meant
that
in
this
case,
the
procedure
which
was
followed
and
i
take
it,
it
would
be
the
only
procedure
that
would
be
required
under
the
order
of
the
circuit
court,
the
doctors
who
had
him
in
his
custody
certify
that
he
is
able
to
stand
trial
and
i
think,
--
i
think
that
would
be
--
would
be
sufficient
because
they
were
the
ones
that
--
which
the
order
of
committing
him
into
the
custody
was
originally
predicated.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
believe,
they
were,
i
believe
they
were,
the
same
doctors.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court,
committed
him
to
the
insane
asylum
until
he
was
restored
to
sanity
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
and
the
--
and
there
is
this
order
of
the
--
or
directive
or
memorandum,
whatever
character
you
wish
to
--
whatever
way
you
want
to
describe
it,
it
said
he
was
now
restored
to
sanity.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
it
is
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
it
--
it
--
whether
the
circuit
court
should
have
been
formally
in
an
order
base
on
that
ex
parte
statement
of
the
doctor,
i
don't
know,
the
record
doesn't
reveal
that
there
was
ever
any
formal
second
action
taken
by
the
circuit
court
of
colbert
county.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
that
--
the
formal
order
does
not
go
--
does
not
go
further
than
to
say
that,
he
was
--
wait
a
minute,
it's
a
--
i've
--
i've
misled
the
court.
if
you
look
at
page
6
of
the
record,
there
is
an
order
to
remove
defendant
back
to
colbert
county
alabama
jail
to
stand
trial.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i'm
--
i'm
just
trying
to
--
look
at
this
order,
no
sir,
it
doesn't.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
other
than
the
--
other
than
the
action
of
the
jury,
yes.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
unless
you
would
regard
the
order
directing
the
return
of
the
defendant
–-
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
so
far
as
i
know,
that's
the
only
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
nothing.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes
--
yes.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
as
far
as
i
know,
there
was
none,
your
honor.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes
--
yes.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
think,
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
it
was
to
the
--
to
the
scope
of
the
inquiry
that
we
have
brought
here.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
now,
of
--
the
other
point
is
certainly
involved
in
the,
and
--
and
challenges
anybody
that
is
concerned
with
whether
this
man
got
due
process.
in
answer
to
justice
stewart,
i
have
to
say
that
the
question
that
we
have
presented
does
not
go
to
that,
doesn't
go
as
far
as
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
in
reviewing
the
--
the
background
of
this
the
entire
matter,
all
of
these
things
can
be
weighed
the
court.
but
the
--
the
point
that
was
specifically
brought
here
related
to
the
confession
and
determined
whether
the
confession
is
--
is
--
was
voluntarily
and
so
forth.
i
suppose
all
of
these
things,
the
court
sought
and
so
forth,
are
proper
for
consideration
by
this
court.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
i
might
--
i
might
say
this
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
–
i
am
frank
to
say
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.[laughter]
the
--
the
--
i
don't
think
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
think
this
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
one
reason
that
i
can
give
as
a
little
enlightenment
as
i'm
able
to
give
on
this
court
is,
that
i
didn't
participate
at
all
in
any
of
the
state
proceedings
and
what
--
what
transpired
there
with
respect
to
this
order
as
i
--
i
am
frank
to
say,
i
don't
know.
i
think
i
have
it
but
the
court
wont
need
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case
because
i
believe
that
the
matter
surrounding
this
confession
violates
--
violates
decision
of
this
court.
so
clearly,
that
you
won't
need
to
--
to
reach
the
matter
of
--
of
that
order.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
on
--
the
--
on
relating
to
this
confession
and
all
the
matters
that
surround
this
confession.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
sir?
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
that's
right.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i'm
saying
that
i
would
be
here
irrespective
of
--
of
the
order
of
the
--
of
absence
of
an
order
restoring
him
to
sanity.
i
--
i
would
be
here
anyway
on
this
record
contending
that
his
confession
was
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
and
--
and
in
alabama,
i
know
that
they
--
they
treated
this
as
an
order
by
the
court
for
the
restoration
of
--
restore
this
man
to
his
civil
rights.
i'm
sure
it
proceeded
on
that
basis.
whether
there
--
whether
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process
because
there
wasn't
a
formal
hearing
and
re-adjudication,
i
don't
know,
i
think
all
of
those
factors
are
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
thank
you,
sir.
thank
you.
now,
it
--
it's
our
position
that
it
would
have
been
improper
to
have
convicted
this
insane
person
on
a
statement
obtained
from
him
at
the
time
that
all
medical
opinion
agreed
that
he
was
insane,
even
if
there
had
not
been
the
prolonged
questioning.
in
watts
against
indiana,
justice
frankfurter
and
his
opinion
referred
to
something
that
it
was
at
least
as
old
as
1824,
which
says,
"the
law
will
not
suffer
prisoner
to
be
made
the
deluded
instrument
of
his
own
conviction."
if
that
statement
hasn't
got
meaning
in
this
case,
we
don't
know
in
what
type
of
case
it
could
be
given
meaning.
the
law
will
not
permit
the
trial
of
an
insane
prisoner.
alabama
recognized
this
fact.
therefore,
they
sent
this
man
off
for
four
and
half
years
but
they
bring
him
back
and
try
him
on
the
basis
of
confession
which
was
obtained
when
he
had
no
counsel,
when
he
was
not
represented
by
anybody
and
again,
at
the
time
when
all
the
medical
opinion
agreed
that
he
was
insane.
at
least
he'd
been
standing
trial
when
he
was
insane,
he
would
have
the
protection
of
the
court.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
the
question,
your
honor.
the
--
the
--
it
would
certainly
appear
to
me
as
it
does
to
you
that
that
should
not
--
that
there
should
have
been
some
adjudication
of
that
question
and
i
would
have
thought
that,
based
on
all
the
medical
testimony
before
that
court
that
the
adjudication
could
not
have
been
otherwise
been
that
he
was
mentally
insane,
but
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes
sir.
well,
he
and
in
it
--
i'm
suggesting
--
i
don't
see
how
the
judgment
could
have
been
set
aside
out,
but
that
--
that
was
not
done.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
i
wouldn't
object
any
of
it
and
for
that
thought.
now,
whether
that
--
whether
this
prolonged
questioning
of
nine
or
10
hours
is
sufficient
to
invalidate
the
confession
or
whether
petitioner's
insanity
standing
alone
would
void
his
confession,
this
court
need
not
decide
because
as
this
court
has
recently
affirmed
in
thomas
against
arizona,
in
each
instance
our
inquiry
must
weigh
the
circumstances
of
pressure
against
the
power
of
resistance
of
the
person's
confession.
this
was
the
rule
in
haley
against
ohio
and
spano
against
new
york,
in
fikes
against
alabama.
if
we
might
for
just
a
minute
compare
the
--
the
facts
of
this
case
with
the
facts
in
the
fikes
case,
in
fikes,
the
questioning
that
led
up
to
the
confession
was
never
longer
than
two
or
three
hours
at
the
time.
and
all
of
it
was
during
the
normal
hours.
in
our
case,
blackburn
was
questioned
for
five
hours
without
interruption,
stopped
for
an
hour
for
supper
and
it
was
resumed
for
another
four
hours.
the
questioning
was
terminated
at
10
or
11
o'clock
at
night.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
there
were
three
according
to
the
deputy
sheriff.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
he
said
that
he
stayed
in
the
room
the
whole
time.
the
other
officers
were
coming
in
and
out
and
that
they
from
time
to
time
asked
questions.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
he
did
the
most
of
the
questions,
yes.
he
said,
he
remained
there
throughout
the
questioning.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
according
to
him
and
the
deputy
sheriff,
it
was
four
feet
by
six
feet
or
six
feet
by
eight
feet.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
that
didn't
fit.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
started
one
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
and
concluded
at
11
--
10
or
11
o'clock
at
night.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
one
to
six.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
10
or
11,
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
there
were
three
--
three
officers
that
participated
in
the
questioning.
the
deputy
sheriff
said
he
remained
there
throughout
that
these
other
officers
were
coming
in
and
out
and
that
they
joined
in
the
questioning.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
it
starts
at
page
93.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes.
there
is
no
contention
that
it
was
in
question
and
answer
form,
it's
narrative,
it's
paragraphed.
now,
in
the
fikes
also,
this
court
took
notice
of
the
fact
that
fikes
was
an
uneducated
person
and
of
low
mentality
but
of
course
here,
the
incapacity
is
infinitely
greater
than
in
the
case
of
fikes.
in
fikes,
the
said
matter
of
significance,
it
was
noted
by
this
court
was
that
fikes
had
had
at
the
most
one
previous
experience
with
the
criminal
processes.
so
far,
it
appears
in
this
record,
jesse
blackburn
had
no
previous
experiences
with
the
law
and
it's
difficult
to
see
how
he
could
have
since
he
had
been
the
insane
asylum
since
he
was
led
out
of
the
army.
so,
the
three
--
three
of
the
matters
that
were
of
greater
significance
to
this
court
in
fikes
are
all
present
here
and
into
a
much
greater
degree.
in
spano
against
new
york,
this
court
said,
“the
limits
of
constitutional
due
process
in
any
case
depends
upon
the
weighing
of
circumstances
of
pressure
against
the
power
of
resistance
to
the
person
confessing.
what
would
be
overpowering
to
the
weak
of
will
of
man
might
be
utterly
ineffective
against
and
experience
criminal.”
so,
when
applying
the
test
of
fikes,
spano,
haley
and
thomas
cases,
we
must
consider
the
character
of
blackburn's
derangement.
he
was
a
schizophrenic,
paranoid
type,
a
100%
mentally
disabled.
in
grave's,
attorney's
texas,
book
of
medicine
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
the
determination
by
the
government
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
it's
--
it's
not
set
out
in
that
context
in
the
medical
report.
he
was
first
adjudicated
50%
mentally
disabled
and
then
a
100%
mentally
disabled
and
i
--
he
was
in
the
government
hospital
during
the
whole
period
of
time,
so
i
don't
--
i
doubt
if
there
could
have
been
any
question
about
his
being
totally
disabled
from
the
standpoint
of
working
that
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
those
are
the
hospital
records
from
illinois
which
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes.
now,
grave
referring
to
schizophrenia
said,
“if
the
victim
of
even
simple
schizophrenia
“is
driven,”
the
patient
breaks
down
to
the
same
effect,
is
smooth
in
his
law
of
insanity,”
also,
grave
states,
“should
the
patient
apparently
recover
from
schizophrenia,
stoppage
of
progress
is
all
that
occurs
with
residual
changes,
permanent
in
character.”
now
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
don't
--
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
have
date
here.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
to
say,
i
just
don't
know
what
the
--
what
the
date
of
these
texts
are.
this,
i
think
this
is
a
third
edition
text
of
grave's
from
which
i'm
quoting
but,
i
don't
know
the
date
at.
now,
we
may
say,
what
was
the
power
of
resistance
of
this
schizophrenic,
to
nine
hours
of
virtually
uninterrupted
questioning?
such
a
confession
could
in
no
way
be
treated
as
voluntary
as
this
court
has
given
meaning
to
that
word.
but,
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
alabama
seek
to
avoid
the
impact
of
this
court's
decisions?
well,
first
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
mention
any
of
the
decisions
upon
which
petitioner
relied.
it
never
purported
to
apply
the
test
which
this
court
has
laid
down
in
those
cases.
second,
if
found
in
the
alleged
conflict
in
the
testimony
of
the
doctors,
who
were
appointed
by
the
state
of
alabama
on
this
original
sanity
board
and
held
that
the
trial
court
could
appropriately
have
given
greater
weight
to
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
doctors
than
to
the
other
two
doctors
on
that
sanity
board.
but,
again,
referring
to
the
report
on
the
basis
of
which
blackburn
was
adjudged
insane
and
committed
to
the
hospital
for
some
four
and
half
years,
look
at
page
76
of
the
record,
the
last
paragraph
there.
there
is
the
statement
by
all
three
of
the
doctors,
dr.
richards
on
whom
the
court
of
appeals
relied
and
the
other
two
doctors,
it
is
the
opinion
of
each
of
us
and
our
opinion
jointly
and
collectively,
that
the
said
jesse
blackburn
at
the
time
of
his
admission
to
the
circuit
hospital
was
insane
and
incompetent.
and
also,
that
it's
their
opinion
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
offense
of
which
he
was
charged.
so,
we
--
and
not
only
that,
but
in
the
same
deposition
which
the
court
of
appeals
suggests,
it
finds
substantial
conflict.
dr.
richards
was
asked
the
question
whether
he
still
conformed
to
the
opinions
which
was
stated
in
this
order
and
he
stated
that
he
did
at
page
77
of
the
record.
what
dr.
richards
said
on
cross
examination
after
affirming
his
view
as
stated
in
this
report
that
blackburn
was
insane
when
he
first
examined
him
and
insane
in
his
opinion
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
he
said
at
page
81
of
the
record,
that
jesse
blackburn
was
up
on
the
terminal
wall
and
he
was
such
a
nuisance
until
i
didn't
see
him
often.
dr.
harry
looked
after
him
mainly.
then
he
asked
him,
“was
he
normal?”
he
said,
“yes,
he
was
normal
all
the
time.”
asking
if
he
had
psychotic
episodes
and
he
says,
“none.”
and
then
they
say,
at
the
bottom
of
page
83,
state
in
ordinary
lay
language,
what
a
psychotic
episode
is,
they
said
he
couldn't
answer
that.
then,
he
was
asked,
“is
it
not
the
fact,
dr.
richards
from
your
observation
of
jesse
blackburn
that
he
at
times
has
lucid
intervals
and
he
answered
at
the
bottom
of
page
82
of
the
record,
“i
do
not
think
so.”
so,
that
here's
the
doctor
that
the
state
of
alabama
is
relying
on
for
this
substantial
conflict
in
the
record.
and
i
submit
that
if
dr.
richards'
testimony
stood
alone,
that
it
would
not
overcome
the
presumption
which
is
the
law
on
alabama
that
a
confession
is
presumptively
involuntary
because
he
is
the
man
that
says,
that
he
doesn't
think
this
fellow
ever
had
lucid
interval
in
his
life.
he
can
confirms
that
he
gets
--
that
the
man
was
insane
when
he
first
examined
him
and
was
insane
when
he
committed
the
crime
and
--
it
would
--
the
court
of
appeals
states
that
it
--
that
the
--
richards'
testimony
was
in
hopeless
conflict
to
the
testimony
of
the
other
doctors.
i
submit
that
in
all
candor
dr.
richards'
testimony
was
in
hopeless
conflict
with
dr.
richards'
testimony
and
that
it
could
in
no
way
overcome
the
presumption
that
this
man
was
insane.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
there
isn't,
your
honor.
i
think,
it's
fair
to
say
that
it
--
i
don't
--
there
is
nothing
that
even
puts
him
at
the
scene.
the
only
--
only
other
evidence
relates
to
his
being
in
alabama
and
--
and
that
nobody
identified
him
as
being
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
i
don't
believe
that
there
would
be
any
question
but
that
his
conviction
was
predicated
almost
solely
on
his
confession.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
there
was
evidence,
you
honor
that
an
automobile
–
a
buick
automobile
of
a
general
type
of
description
was
there.
i
don't
think
it
was
identified
by
a
license
number
or
anything
else
and
to
be
honest
about
it,
i
think
the
automobile
was
not
his.
it
belonged
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
i
don't
believe
he
was
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
he
come
--
he
had
been
a
passenger
of
the
car
that
his
come
down
there,
it
was
owned
by
another
man
and
that
man
had
driven
it
to
alabama
and
there
was
this
general
description
of
a
maroon
automobile
at
the
scene.
but,
i
don't
believe
that
the
conviction
could
have
been
predicated
on
information
as
loose
as
that.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
know
of
nothing
else.
now,
the
court
had
before
it
of
course,
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
much
more
than
merely
conflict
in
the
depositions
of
these
three
doctors.
the
court
had
before
it,
the
opinion
of
the
local
doctors
which
it
had
reported,
which
said
he
was
probably
insane.
it
had
before
its
own
order,
adjudicating
blackburn
insane
and
committing
him
to
an
insane
asylum
permanently
until
restored
to
sanity.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes
--
yes.
it
had
before
him
the
order
of
the
circuit
court
of
mobile
which
had
adjudicated
him,
insane.
it
had
before
him
the
knowledge
which
is
shown
in
the
record
of
petitioner's
previous
commitments
to
insane
institutions.
and
it
had
before
him
also
the
knowledge
that
it
took
some
four
years
or
more
of
treatment
in
an
insane
institution
in
alabama
before
the
persons
having
him
in
custody
could
state
in
their
opinion
he
was
sufficiently
restored
to
sanity
to
stand
in
trial.
we
think,
it
is
ironic
--
ironic
in
this
case
that
the
minimum
protection
which
the
court
of
alabama
--
which
the
courts
of
alabama
accorded
petitioner
that
is
send
him
off
to
--
to
the
insane
asylum
for
some
four
and
half
years,
could
well
have
been
the
basis
on
which
this
final
adjudication
about
the
jury
rested.
it's
as
though
we
have
--
it's
as
though
the
question
before
the
jury
was
whether
a
man
with
that
offence
and
the
state
of
alabama
send
him
off
for
four
and
half
years
and
fattened
him
up,
and
brought
him
back
and
then
the
jury
is
supposed
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
he
was
sane
four
and
half
years
ago.
his
insanity
was
so
apparent.
there,
when
he
was
originally
supposed
to
have
come
up
for
trial
that
even
the
jailer
noted
it.
and
of
course,
we've
said
all
the
doctors
noted
it.
but
they
send
him
off
for
four
and
half
years
and
then
brought
him
back
and
call
the
medical
doctors
in,
certainly
we
can
assume
his
condition
was
substantially
improved
and
stated
that
it
was
improved
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
opportunity
for
the
jury
to
observe
him,
that
the
jury
brought
in
this
verdict
that
the
--
he
was
mentally
competent.
as
justice
frankfurter
stated
in
his
opinion
in
malinski
against
new
york,
the
fourteenth
amendment
expresses
a
demand
for
civilized
standards
of
law.
reluctantly,
i
must
state
that
in
my
opinion,
the
state
of
alabama
has
not
met
this
demand
with
respect
to
jesse
blackburn.
and
i
earnestly
say
to
this
court,
to
release
this
man
who
has
been
in
the
custody
of
state
of
alabama
for
some
11
years
at
this
time.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
hope
sir
that
he
had
go
back
to
the
mental
hospital
that
he's
overly
from
and
has
overly
now
for
11
years
in
hospital
in
illinois
which
under
--
to
whose
care
the
army
committed
him
when
it
put
him
out
of
the
army.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
--
i
don't
know
your
honor
whether
they
were
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
alabama
could
perhaps
retry
him
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
yes.
well,
i've
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
think
you're
right,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
if
i
may
reply
to
just
one
of
two
things
that
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
--
mr.
gish
has
commented
upon.
first
that
i
had
an
opportunity
at
recess,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
look
to
the
date
of
this
volume
i
was
quoted.
i
believe
we
find
it,
it
wasn't
1900.
it
is
1958.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
third
edition,
yes.
and
the
statement
that
appears
substantially
in
the
form
of
--
i've
got
in
my
brief,
if
driven
the
patient
breaks
down
with
respect
to
schizophrenia
and
also
the
statement,
"should
the
patient
apparently
recover,"
stoppage
progress
is
all
that
occurs
with
residual
changes
permanently
encountered.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir.
they've
been
cited
in
both
in
my
brief
both
this
time
and
in
1956.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
[laughter]
i
appreciate
that.
mr.
gish
has
mentioned
the
fact
that
some
of
alabama
cases
say
that
these
reports,
medical
reports,
are
not
admissible
in
evidence.
i
think
he
made
it
clear,
as
i'm
sure
he
intended
to
do,
that
they
are
properly
introduced
and
were
properly
introduced
in
evidence
in
this
case.
the
case
to
which
he
refers
is
one
where
the
statements
were
offered
without
any
testimony
of
the
doctors
along
with
it.
in
this
case,
the
report
was
--
of
the
sanity
commission
was
offered
at
--
in
--
in
the
process
of
the
deposition
of
the
doctors.
and
they
identified
it
as
their
wake
and
each
of
them
confirmed
it
including
dr.
richards.
he
was
specifically
asked
if
that
report
was
his
and
if
he
confirmed
the
statements
that
were
made
therein.
and
he
said
that
he
did.
so
the
report
is
they
must
be
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
gish
has
referred
several
times
to
the
fact
while
his
nine-hour
interrogation
was
going
on,
that
the
deputy
sheriff
was
writing
out
the
confession.
of
course,
i
think
the
evidence
was
showed
that
actually,
the
confession
was
signed
the
next
morning.
it
was
not
--
not
signed
that
night
although
apparently,
it
was
substantially
completed
that
night.
but
i
plead
guilty
for
southerners
to
talking
slowly
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
indication
that
southerners
necessarily
right
slowly
and
i
don't
believe
this
nine-hour
interrogation
was
very
much
of
it
was
consumed
in
the
--
the
writing
by
the
deputy
sheriff
of
this
report
which
wasn't
signed
until
the
next
morning.
there's
been
--
it's
an
argument
in
--
in
respondent's
brief
and
he
alludes
to
adhere
about
the
limited
information
that
was
given
to
the
trial
court
on
voir
dire.
now,
that
omits
the
fact
that
in
the
course
of
these
depositions,
the
course
of
the
depositions
of
these
doctors,
they
were
given
the
--
the
court
was
given
the
--
the
sanity
--
the
order
of
the
sanity
commission,
the
recommendations
about
the
insanity
of
jesse
blackburn.
it
--
it
was
given
again
on
--
on
voir
dire
and
if
it
needed
its
recollection
refreshed
its
own
order
committing
this
patient
to
the
insane
hospital
which
order
reflected
the
fact
that
this
man
had
been
institutionalized
for
mental
illness
on
prior
occasions
and
so
forth.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
substantially
everything
that
would
be
before
this
court
except
the
detailed
information
in
the
veteran
hospital
came
in
on
voir
dire.
mr.
gish
is
correct
in
stating
that
the
petitioner
did
not
take
the
stand
in
connection
with
voir
dire.
but
all
this
information
about
his
previous
insanity
was
certainly
available
to
the
court
at
the
time
that
the
court
made
--
the
trial
judge
made
the
determination
that
this
confession
was
voluntary.
and
in
conclusion,
let
me
get
just
point
out
that
alabama
is
standing
here
in
the
position
of
saying
that
dr.
richards
said
the
testimony
that
creates
this
conflict
and
that
is
the
testimony
to
which
he
must
assign
credibility,
if
that'd
be
true,
alabama
is
in
the
unquestionable
position
of
having
kept
the
same
man
in
the
insane
asylum
for
four
and
a
half
years
on
the
determination
by
dr.
richards
that
he
was
insane.
and
yet,
he
comes
here
and
asks
that
this
man
be
declared
sane
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
of
the
same
dr.
richards.
we
humbly
request
that
this
court
grant
jesse
blackburn
the
due
process
of
law
for
which
he
pleads
and
that
this
action
below
be
reversed.
