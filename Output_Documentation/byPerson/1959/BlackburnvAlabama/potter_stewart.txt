justice

stewart
would
you
think
that
they
found
that
there
is
a
regional
confinement
to
the
asylum
was
upon
a
formal
adjudication
of
insanity?
justice
potter
stewart
not
just
that
interim
two
judge
--
two
doctors
business
or
something
--
justice
potter
stewart
one
other
question,
mr.
hobbs
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
you
proceed.
you
told
us
that,
at
his
trial,
the
only
evidence
as
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
contention
that
he
made
was
given
by
the
sheriff
--
the
deputy
sheriff
for
the
reason
that
he,
the
petitioner,
was
unable
to
remember.
then
you
told
us
i
think
that
during
this
period
of
his
confinement
in
the
insane
asylum,
i'm
not
--
this
is
my
question,
did
you
tell
us
the
record
shows
that
he
was
given
shock
treatments
there
or
did
you
simply
call
our
attention
to
the
fact
that
it's
well
known
and
this
is
often
given
to
cases
of
schizophrenia?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hobbs,
can
you
tell
us
as
the
record
show,
i
couldn't
see
that
it
did.
just
when
it
was
that
the
jailer
noticed
the
symptoms
of
insanity
with
relation
to
the
time
that
the
confession
had
been
given?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
prefer
my
reading
that
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
--
sometimes,
shortly
or
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
do
have
something
roughly
equivalent
to
adjudication
as
--
corpus
to
stand
trial
in
the
order
mention
on
page
7
carrying
over
on
page

says,
"it
now
appears
to
the
court
that
under
date
of
october
7,
1952,
the
hospital
certified
to
the
court
as
the
opinion
on
the
members
and
staff
that
blackburn
is
presently
mentally
competent
and
should
be
returned
in
the
custody
of
this
court."
justice
potter
stewart
do
that
extent
of
this,
you
have
--
you
have
such
a
--
certification.
justice
potter
stewart
our
issue
here
is
that
--
did
not
either
this
man's
mental
condition
at
the
time
of
the
trial
or
his
mental
condition
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
alleged
offense.
it
is
rather
his
condition
at
the
time
that
the
confession
was
elicited
from
him,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hobbs,
what
does
that
mean
100%
or
--
or
50%,
that
in
terms
of
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
disability
payments,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
guess
it
was
a
kind
of
strange
expression
to
me
in
this
context
and
i
thought
that
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
matters
of
administrational
payments?
justice
potter
stewart
the
one
witness
you
referred
to,
was
the
deputy
sheriff?
justice
potter
stewart
it
also
was
described?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
that's
the
car
in
the
words
and
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
those
were
not
offered
in
evidence
in
this
case.
