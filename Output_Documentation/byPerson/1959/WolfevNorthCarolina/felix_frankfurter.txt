justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
it
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
prove?
what
offer
of
proof
did
they
make
that
was
denied
by
the
trial
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
--
what
does
that
mean,
i
told
you
that
you
could
call
him
as
your
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
the
real
--
the
real
ruling
adversed
to
you,
that
is
to
be
complained
of,
is
that
he
wouldn't
allow
you
to
introduce
as
evidence
on
the
basis
of
having
called
a
hostile
witness
rather
than
calling
him
as
your
witness
and
making
him
your
witness
and
then
making
this
offer.
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
a
--
you
--
is
that
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
isn't
that
a
ruling
on
the
local
law
of
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
didn't
rule
that
you
couldn't
offer
their
testimony.
he
said,
“you
must
introduce
that
to
one
vehicle
rather
than
another.
you
chose
to
bring
this
in
as
an
impeaching
testimony.”
and
the
court
said,
“bring
him
in.
call
him
as
your
witness.”
now,
i'm
not
--
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
right
or
wrong
about
it,
but
i
want
to
know
whether
that
is
the
basis
of
saying
some
united
states
constitutional
right
was
denied
to,
that
he
made
a
ruling
as
to
whether
you
should
have
an
adverse
witness
or
your
own
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
the
--
then
the
claim
of
violation
of
due
process
is
that
you
weren't
allowed
to
bring
forward
your
testimony,
relevant
testimony
and
therefore,
the
trial
was
fundamentally
unfair.
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
discrimination
or
the
use
of
the
golf
course
or
anything.
that
has
to
do
with
the
conduct
of
a
trial
and
he
alleged
unjustifiable
--
so
unjustifiable
as
divided
at
the
due
process
of
letting
you
prove
your
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
you
--
you
could
have
to
tell
me
whether
you
maintain
that
the
court,
the
trial
court,
unqualifiedly
prevented
you
from
putting
in
this
evidence
or
merely
said
you
can't
do
it
this
way
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
them,
calling
them
the
way
you
did.
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
didn't
even
say
you
couldn't
--
you
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that.
i
don't
know
the
rest
of
the
record,
but
what
you
called
your
--
our
attention
on
page
78
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
right
or
wrong
in
reading
that
merely
as
a
ruling
as
to
the
time
and
manner
and
circumstances
under
which
what
you
offered
to
prove
you
were
disallowed
to
prove.
isn't
that
all
that's
set
there
on
page
78?
you
may
have
other
matters
in
the
record
with
which
i'm
not
familiar.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
ruling
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
is
the
ruling,
if
i
may
intervene,
that's
the
ruling
of
case.
the
judgment
of
which
is
the
one
that
is
now
before
us.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying,
what
was
the
determined
in
that
case
was
res
judicata
in
the
subsequent
state
case
in
which
on
the
assumption
that
the
same
issue
was
involved
--
that
the
same
issue
was
involved,
is
that
the
point?
that
it
was
res
judicata?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
that
the
issue
was
determined
one
way
in
the
prior
proceeding
to
show
in
the
federal
court
which
subsequently
became
--
came
into
issue
to
the
state
court
and
therefore
the
issue
was
foreclosed
by
the
federal
--
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
--
what
the
point
is.
is
that
the
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
could
become
supreme
on
the
--
on
the
area
of
res
judicata,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
all
depends
what
they
found
a
crime,
isn't
that
it?
the
federal
case
was
about
the
constitutional
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
in
the
enjoyment
of
state
activities,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
specifically
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
it
arouse
in
connection
with
the
protection
against
discrimination
by
a
state
in
the
use
of
its
facilities,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
well
be
but
for
instance,
that
federal
judgment
didn't
say
that
anybody
could
slug
somebody
else
on
those
golf
grounds,
could
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
so
the
question
is
whether
the
legal
issue
was
the
same
and
even
if
it
wasn't
the
same,
it
has
then
a
question
either
of
res
judicata
of
independently
a
violation
--
infringement
of
what
this
court
held
since
brown
against
allen,
is
that
your
--
is
that
it?
i'm
trying
to
find
what
the
constitutional
claim
is
that
you
make
other
than
the
one
you
made
yesterday
that
the
conduct
of
this
trial
on
the
charge
of
whether
essentially
was
a
breach
of
the
thieves
or
something
like
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean,
what
was
the
charge?
what
did
north
carolina
charged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
perfect,
thanks.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
alright.
it
was
trespassing.
it
was
criminal
charge
not
saying
that
a
colored
person
hasn't
the
right
the
other
white
person
has
at
least
not
only
that
is
what
was
claimed.
that
is
what
the
north
carolina
prosecuted
them
for.
so,
you
may
say
that's
what
it
amounted
to
in
effect.
that's
what
you
are
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
a
question
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
on
the
question
out
to
you
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
would
be
good
enough
to
turn
to
page
on
105
of
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
(inaudible)
is
tended
by
the
defendant,
(inaudible)
supreme
court.
to
whom
was
the
record
tended
--
the
case
on
appeal
tended?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that's
what
he
meant.
in
below,
we
have
the
record
to
be
acknowledging
the
service
by
the
solicitor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
if
an
appeal
is
taken
from
the
superior
court,
from
any
superior
court
in
north
carolina,
the
case
on
appeal
is
made
up
by
the
appealing
party
in
this
case
the
present
petitioner
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
it's
submitted
to
the
appellee
and
if
the
appellee
has
any
objection,
he
was
(inaudible)
permitted
or
included
(inaudible)
do
you
then
go
before
the
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
here
--
you
or
--
petitioner
made
up
--
the
counsel
made
up
this
record
submitted
to
the
solicitor
of
the
18th
judicial
district
and
he
okayed
it,
and
that's
the
basis
of
the
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
infer
from
your
statement
which
is
the
(inaudible)
they
offered
and
rejected
and
claimed
that
this
improperly
rejected
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
things
you've
said
--
