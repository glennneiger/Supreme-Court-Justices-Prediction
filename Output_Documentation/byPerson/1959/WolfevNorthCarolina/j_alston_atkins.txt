mr.
j.
alston
atkins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
court
postponed
further
consideration
of
request
in
the
jurisdiction
until
this
hearing
on
the
merit.
we
have
discussed
the
manner
of
jurisdiction
at
length
as
the
first
question
in
the
brief
on
the
merits
and
we
do
request
consideration
here.
appellants
have
alleged
the
questions
of
jurisdiction
in
this
kind
of
setting.
in
this
case,
six
negro
appellants
who
are
citizens
of
greensboro,
north
carolina,
had
been
convicted
of
the
crime
of
criminal
trespass
for
peacefully
playing
golf
on
the
public
municipal
golf
course
of
that
city.
and
appellants
are
under
a
15-day
jail
sentences
imposed
under
section
14-134
of
the
general
statutes
of
north
carolina.
appellants
alleged
first
in
the
motion
to
quash
and
then
in
the
motion
to
set
aside
the
verdict,
the
motion
to
quash
being
incorporated
also
in
the
motion
to
set
aside
the
verdict.
that
this
statute
in
this
case
has
been
and
is
being
unconstitutionally
applied
to
these
appellants
because
it
is
being
used
to
implement
by
prosecution
and
jail
sentences,
the
denial
of
certain
constitutional
rights
of
appellant
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
also
in
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution.
in
that
--
first
in
this
case
on
the
question
of
racial
discrimination,
the
trial
court
was
put
upon
notice
in
the
motion
to
quash
that
the
position
of
the
defendants
there,
appellants
here,
was
raising
a
question
of
racial
discrimination
and
when
the
trial
came
on,
the
trial
court
in
this
case
close
the
mouths
of
the
state's
agencies
who
were
in
operation
and
control
of
this
golf
course
by
refusing
to
permit
them
to
divulge
what
they
knew
and
it's
--
we
believe
what
the
state
knew
as
to
the
operation
of
this
golf
course,
so
far
as
the
exclusion
of
negroes
from
participation
and
discrimination
against
them
in
play
upon
this
golf
course
those
actions
of
the
trial
court
found
on
pages
45,
48,
and
78
of
the
record,
where
on
page
45,
the
appellee's
agent
(inaudible)
who
was
the
assistant
golf
pro
in
charge
of
the
golf
course,
when
appellants
sought
to
play,
testified
that
no
negro
had
played
on
this
golf
course,
insofar
as
he
knew
and
when
--
but
that
some
had
sought
to
play
and
when
he
was
asked
to
tell
why
they
have
not
played,
the
trial
court
would
not
permit
him
to
testify
with
reference
to
why
negroes
had
not
played
on
the
golf
course.
on
page
48
of
the
record
when
the
golf
pro
and
manager
of
the
golf
course
himself,
was
on
the
stand
--
and
by
the
way,
his
testimony
shows
that
he
had
been
the
golf
pro
and
manager
from
the
time
the
golf
course
was
first
opened
in
1941,
down
until
the
time
of
this
trial.
he
was
not
permitted
by
the
trial
court
even
to
tell
whether
or
not
any
negroes
had
played
on
the
golf
course,
to
say
nothing
of
while
he
had
not
played.
as
of
those
two
witnesses,
it's
our
view
that
they
knew
more
about
the
question
of
racial
discrimination
on
this
golf
course
than
anybody
else
and
that
it
was
virtually
preventing
the
appellants,
defendants
there,
from
proving
by
the
state's
own
agents,
whose
knowledge
we
believe
of
knowledge
of
the
state,
that
there
was
in
fact
racial
discrimination
and
exclusion
from
this
golf
course.
now,
on
page
78
of
the
record,
the
president
of
the
golf
corporation
which
was
found
to
be
insofar
as
i
know,
there's
no
dispute
as
to
that
golf
corporation
being
an
agency
of
the
state,
it
appeared
that
he
was
a
witness
in
a
case
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina,
which
i
shall
discuss
shortly.
where
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
his
name
is
john
r.
hughes.
he
was
the
president
of
this
golf
corporation
which
was
in
control
in
management
of
the
golf
course.
he
had
testified
in
a
case
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina,
involving
the
identical
acts
of
playing
golf
which
held
to
be
a
crime
in
this
case.
and
the
appellants,
defendants
there,
undertook
to
show
by
this
witness
that
what
he
testified
to
in
that
case.
and
the
trial
court
refused
on
this
ground.
appellants
have
sought
to
call
him
as
an
adverse
witness
when
the
state
rested
this
case
without
calling
him
and
the
trial
court
refused
to
be
permit
--
to
permit
and
to
be
called
as
an
adverse
witness.
he
had
been
subpoenaed
to
bring
the
bylaws
of
the
corporation
which
he
did.
and
so
the
defendants,
appellants
here,
put
him
on
the
stand
anyway
and
to
try
to
prove
what
he
knew
better
than
anybody
else,
in
turning
--
concerning
the
operation
of
this
golf
course
and
he
had
been
the
chief
witness
through
which
racial
discrimination
and
the
mechanics
and
the
actualities
of
operating
the
golf
course
have
been
proved
in
the
federal
court
case
to
which
i
will
come
in
a
moment.
and
because
the
appellants,
defendants
there
had
--
had
called
him,
when
state
rested
without
calling
him
and
when
the
federal
court
refused
to
permit
and
to
be
called
as
an
adverse
witness,
i
think
the
record
shows
clearly
that
he
was
hostile.
the
trial
court
would
not
permit
the
appellants,
defendants
there,
to
prove
anything
in
the
transcript
of
the
record
from
the
federal
court
by
this
witness.
we
think
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
these
actions
of
the
trial
court
do
implement
a
denial
of
due
process
by
preventing
the
defendants'
files
here
from
proving
that
case
there
and
hence,
preventing
them
from
proving
the
question
of
racial
discrimination.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
they
--
the
defendants
there,
counsel
for
defendants,
when
the
witness
hughes
had
said
that
he
had
not
testified
for
his
association
in
the
federal
court
case.
the
counsel
for
appellants,
defendants,
said
--
i
think
that's
found
on
the
top
of
page
78
of
the
record,
“i
hold
in
my
hand
a
transcript
of
the
record
in
that
case.
whereupon,
the
prosecuting
solicitor
objected
and
the
trial
court
would
not
permit
the
appellants,
defendants
there,
to
go
any
further
into
the
matter
of
what
was
in
that
transcript
of
the
record.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
defendants
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
--
have
sought
to
call
him
as
an
adverse
witness,
so
that
they
might
impeach
him.
and
if
he
was
hostile
as
he
was
clearly
hostile
from
his
answer
to
the
question
in
the
bottom
of
page
77,
the
state
would
not
--
i
though
that
the
--
the
trial
court
would
not
permit
him
to
be
called
an
adverse
witness.
and
to
try
to
have
his
testimony,
the
defendants
called.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
except
as
it
presents
a
question
of
fundamental
fairness
which
we
think
it
does,
all
of
these
rulings
not
permitting
these
witnesses
to
testify
with
regard
to
the
question
of
racial
discrimination
which
will
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
well,
as
i
have
thought,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
where
a
state
through
its
agencies,
is
in
possession
of
information
which
nobody
else
possesses
and
we
--
and
we
think
that
that
was
clear
and
true
after
this
president
of
the
operating
corporation
of
the
golf
course,
that
it
--
it
presents
a
question
of
fundamental
unfairness
when
the
state
refuses
to
divulge
through
him,
what
he
knows
with
regard
to
that
matter.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
one
of
the
--
so
far
as
these
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
where
it
is
clear
that
the
question
of
racial
discrimination
is
involved
as
it
was,
we
believe
in
this
case
especially
in
view
of
the
motion
to
quash.
and
the
--
those
who
are
operating
the
golf
course,
the
golf
assistant
pro
(inaudible)
the
golf
pro
manager
then
established,
when
they
are
asked,
"have
negroes
played
on
this
golf
course
as
best
for
last?"
and
he
said,
"they
have
not
to
his
knowledge,
but
that
some
have
presented
themselves
for
playing."
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
we
think
that
it
does
present
a
question
of
fundamental
unfairness
when
the
state
refused
to
permit
him
to
tell
why
the
negroes
were
not
permitted
to
play
or
did
not
play
on
the
golf
course.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
well,
i
think
they
settled
as
to
these
witnesses
that
you
could
not
prove
it
by
them.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
on
a
state.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
the
state
--
the
state
called
up
the
--
the
assistant
golf
pro
and
the
golf
pro,
they
were
not
our
witnesses.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
going
to
the
question
of
adverse
witnesses
as
i
believe
--
well,
so
far
as
we've
been
able
to
find
there's
no
particular
case
on
it,
that
where
a
state
agent
is
in
possession
of
information,
it
is
clear
that
this
agent
is
hostile,
that
the
state
there
has
violated
due
process
where
it
refuses
to
divulge
through
this
witness,
by
a
rule
that
you
cannot
call
him
as
an
adverse
witness.
for
instance,
when
he
said
that
he
had
not
testified
in
the
federal
court
case,
we
were
not
permitted
to
show
by
the
transcript
what
--
what
the
facts
were.
the
second
point
is
that
in
this
case,
this
statute,
if
it
meant
the
conviction
and
sentence
to
jail
of
negro
citizens
for
exercising
constitutional
right
to
play
golf
on
this
golf
course,
the
identical
acts
of
playing
golf
having
been
held
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina
in
the
case
of
simkins
against
city
of
greensboro
and
others,
that
these
identical
acts
represented
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
appellants
and
that
the
denial
of
play
was
unlawful
--
an
unlawful
interference
for
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
defendant
who
were
plaintiffs
in
that
action
and
that
this
denial
was
based
upon
race
and
color.
and
at
that
point,
which
we
think
gives
the
court
jurisdiction
and
other
matter
of
points
that
i
mentioned
in
the
brief,
in
this
case
for
the
very
first
time,
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
determine
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
sir.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
the
criminal
cases
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
--
before.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
they
said
that
the
law
of
racial
discrimination
was
that
defendants
could
not
be
denied
the
right
to
play
because
of
racial
discrimination.
and
that's
why
i
think
that
the
first
point
was
--
we
think
the
first
point
was
important
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
saying
that
racial
discrimination
was
not
involved
and
could
not
be
used
to
keep
defendants
from
playing
on
the
golf
course.
he
was
refusing
to
permit
the
golf
pro
and
the
assistant
golf
pro,
to
tell
why
no
negroes
had
played
on
the
course.
in
other
words,
it's
our
view
so
far
as
that
factual
situation
is
concerned
that
number
one,
the
--
the
very
thing
that
the
trial
court
was
telling
to
the
jury
about
the
federal
law
being
that
negroes
could
not
be
excluded
on
the
ground
of
race,
he
was
by
his
by
rulings,
when
the
assistant
golf
pro
and
the
golf
pro
will
understand,
refusing
to
let
us
prove
those
very
things
which
would
show
racial
discrimination.
the
third
point
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
well,
there
is
a
rule
of
exclusion
which
this
court
asked
about
that
with
reference
to
the
proof
of
racial
discrimination,
since
it
is
very
difficult
to
prove
except
by
laws
or
doing
of
discriminating.
that
is
not
necessary
as
i
understand
the
rule
in
such
cases
hernandez
against
texas
and
eubanks
against
louisiana
and
others,
that
when
the
defendants
in
this
case,
appellants
prove
three
things,
first,
that
they
are
members
of
a
group,
a
clan.
second,
that
some
of
them
have
the
same
qualifications
that
other
people
have
or
permitted
to
exercise
these
public
rights.
and
third,
that
over
a
long
period
of
time,
no
member
of
the
class
has
been
permitted
to
enjoy
his
right
that
that
makes
a
prima
facie
case
which
then
the
state
must
met.
and
we
do
not
think
they
merit
as
required
under
--
under
the
decision
of
this
court.
all
the
testimony
which
they
offered
to
me,
it
was
the
testimony
of
the
assistant
pro
applied
whereas
he
said,
“the
reason
i
didn't
let
them
play
was
that
this
was
a
private
club
for
members
and
invited
guests
only.”
we
think
that
that's
much
weaker
than
in
hernandez
where
five
jury
commissioners
in
the
presence
of
a
prima
facie
case
testified
that
they
had
used
only
their
best
judgment
in
selecting
the
best
qualified
jurors
and
where
the
judges
in
charge
of
the
selection
of
jurors
--
grand
jurors,
i
believe
in
eubanks,
testified
that
they
were
just
trying
to
get
their
best
qualified
people.
now,
that
test
order
was
held
to
be
insufficient
to
meet
the
prima
facie
case.
we
think
that
that
is
adequate
if
evidence
in
the
record
--
aside
from
they
exclude
--
the
excluded
evidence,
but
we
think
that
it
was
a
--
a
denial
of
this
constitutional
rights
to
say
in
one
breath
that
racial
discrimination
has
nothing
to
do
in
the
next
breath
that
you
cannot
prove
it.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
i
understand
that
that's
true.
they
recognize
the
decisions
of
this
court.
it's
not
--
not
original
on
the
--
but
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
correct.
and
then
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
--
and
we
were
first
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
no,
sir.
that
question
was
not
before
the
court
in
that
first
opinion.
that
was
a
failure
of
technical
question
of
whether
or
not,
there
was
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
--
of
error
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
in
adoption
of
the
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
--
servants
of
this
court.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
i
--
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
there
was
a
motion
for
nonsuit,
which
i
think
mass
with
the
same
thing
in
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
close
of
the
evidence.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
and
then
a
motion
set
aside
the
verdict
after
the
verdict,
which
raised
these
constitutional
questions.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
today
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
address
my
remarks
in
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
brennan
which
was
pending
at
the
close
yesterday
involving
all
the
facts
on
racial
discrimination.
if
mr.
justice
brennan
and
court
will
indulge
me,
i
would
like
to
make
a
brief
background
statement
with
regard
to
these
additional
facts
which
i
think
ultimately
will
show
that
this
identical
conduct
of
appellants,
the
identical
acts
of
appellants
which
i
held
to
be
a
crime
in
this
case
have
been
held
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina
to
represent
their
constitutional
rights
and
that
the
acts
of
state's
agents
which
the
state
has
held
to
be
lawful
where
an
unlawful
denial
of
these
constitutional
rights
under
the
federal
constitutions
solely
on
the
grounds
of
race
and
color.
now
while
the
appellate
process
was
running
its
course
in
connection
with
the
first
set
of
warrants
toward
the
first
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court
in
this
case
to
which
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
yesterday,
these
appellants
as
plaintiffs
have
sued
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina
against
state's
agencies,
city
of
greensboro,
greensboro
city
board
of
education
who
held
title
of
the
land
and
gillespie
park
gold
club,
inc.
which
was
operating
it
and
with
--
about
which
they
have
no
question
of
--
they've
also
became
agents
of
the
state.
the
case
was
found
simkins
against
city
of
greensboro
and
others
the
opinion
of
which
is
reported
in
149f.supp.562,
in
due
course
the
case
was
tried
by
the
honorable
justice
j.
hayes
in
response
to
request
for
two
types
of
relief
which
the
appellant's
plaintiffs
here
asked.
first
was
a
declaration
of
the
rights
of
the
parties
concerning
these
identical
conduct
here,
these
are
identical
acts
of
playing
golf
on
this
golf
course
and
the
right
of
appellants
so
to
play
and
also
the
rights
of
the
parties
with
reference
to
the
conduct
of
the
state's
agencies
in
interfering
with
that
right.
second
type
of
relief
asked
was
injunctive
relief
against
any
future
repetition
of
this
type
of
conduct
about
which
are
declaratory
judgment
was
asked
in
the
first
type
of
relief.
upon
the
trial
of
issues,
the
appellants
prevailed
and
a
declaratory
judgment
was
issued
declaring
number
one
but
this
--
these
identical
acts
represented
the
constitutional
rights
of
appellants
and
second
that
the
acts
of
the
defendant's
agent
says
interfering
with
that
right
to
play
was
unlawful
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
it
was
done
solely
on
the
grounds
of
race
and
color.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
no
sir,
there
were
four
other
plaintiffs.
they
were
total
of
ten,
but
i
think
that
the
record
in
that
case
and
opinion
and
all
of
the
items
showed
that
the
facts
of
the
state
supreme
court
say
in
this
case
is
that
this
identical
conduct
was
before
them.
judge
hayes
on
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
all
of
our
--
all
of
the
appellants
in
this
case
were
the
six
plaintiffs
which
i
mentioned
several
times
in
the
opinion
and
findings
of
fact
in
that
case.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
i
wouldn't
use
the
word
res
judicata
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
the
point
is
that
this
judgment
became
supreme
in
our
opinion
in
that
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
well,
i'm
not
as
familiar
with
the
verifications
of
res
judicata
as
to
say
categorically
that
i
think
would
be
exactly
a
question
of
res
judicata
but
we
think
that
the
federal
court
having
held
--
having
found
by
a
declaratory
judgment
that
when
they
were
on
that
golf
course,
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
be
there.
and
that
the
interference
on
the
states
agency
is
whether
that
being
that
was
unlawful
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
the
state
could
not
bear
after
finding
that
conduct
of
being
a
crime
and
to
punish
them
by
jail
sentences
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
not
generally
but
it's
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
specifically
reference
to
this
conduct
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
i
would
think
the
injunction
or
i
went
to
that
point
but
that
--
it
was
a
separate
--
this
declaratory
judgment
built
specifically
with
this
specific
conduct.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
no,
sir.
there
was
no
question
about
the
peaceful
conduct
of
appellants.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
trespass
on
this
property.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
there
was
no
suggestion
in
this
case
anywhere
that
the
conduct
of
appellants
was
other
than
peaceful.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
i
am
saying
that
judge
hayes
found
specifically
that
that
was
what
happened.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
i
say
yes
and
no,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
in
fact,
it
was
the
preservation
of
it
in
this
particular
record,
as
we
will
discuss.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
it
was
executed
but
permission
was
not
given
to
present
it
that
on
the
hearing
of
that
motion.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
denied
the
opportunity.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
well,
the
motion
quash
says
--
requests
an
opportunity
to
present
and
the
--
and
the
motion
was
summarily
disposed
off
as
shown
on
page
108
of
the
record
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
page
108.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
right.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
on
the
--
on
the
hearing
of
the
motion.
of
course
the
state
takes
the
position
that
it
was
not
properly
and
it
was
there
at
that
time
which
--
an
opinion
of
the
federal
court
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
no,
sir.
it
would
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
on
page
71
of
the
record
where
the
clerk
of
the
court
was
on
the
stand
of
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
of
the
federal
district
court
for
middle
district
of
north
carolina
was
on
the
stand.
you'll
see
what
happened
there.
the
full
record
of
it
of
what
was
there
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
but
over
on
page
79,
where
it
appears
that
exhibits
6
and
7
were
excluded
with
objection
to
them
was
sustained.
the
fact
was
that
those
exhibits
6
and
7
represented
the
record
of
the
federal
court
in
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
the
original
documents
--
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
what
actually
happened
there
did
--
it
did
not
by
some
way
that
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
yes.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
i
was
not
in
the
case
under
the
--
in
the
state
courts
so
i
don't
know
exactly
what
happened,
but
i
have
examined
the
original
transcript
of
the
record
in
that
case
and
i
have
attached
for
you
to
see
photo
--
i
grabbed
copies
of
two
pages
when
that
transcript
which
show
that
what
these
exhibits
6
and
7
were
in
fact
they
represented
the
judgment
and
the
findings
of
fact
--
pages
97
and
98
in
the
brief
found
the
other
--
bottom
of
the
page
let
the
record
show
that
being
offered
in
evidence
of
these,
that
is
being
offered
in
evidence,
page
98
of
the
brief
on
the
merits.
now,
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
6
and
7,
that
showing
in
--
the
--
on
page
98
near
the
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
they
were
offered
in
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
they
were
rejected.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
the
record
shows
it.
i
don't
think
the
attorney
general
said
in
fact
that
they
were
not
offered
in
--
these
pages
that
are
photographed
here
are
(inaudible)
original
transcript
of
the
evidence
as
furnished
to
counsel
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
they
were
not
falling
in
this
record.
they
were
tendered
to
--
to
the
supreme
court
on
the
theory
of
judicial
notice
and
the
court
did
not
take
judicial
notice.
there
is
one
little
item
that
i
think
is
pertinent
to
this
because
as
i
understand
the
decision
of
this
court
that
--
a
state
supreme
court
must
be
bound
by
its
rule
and
decisions
that
it
cannot,
it's
forbidden
to
consider
matters
which
technically
do
not
appear
in
the
physical
record.
but,
that
if
the
state
supreme
court
does
have
discretion
to
consider
matters
which
do
not
appear
in
the
physical
record,
that
then
this
court
may
look
into
the
matter
and
it's
not
concluded
absolutely
by
such
inadvertences
as
appear
here.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
some
of
the
important
items
are
in
this
record.
items
which
i'm
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir
and
i
was
just
giving
this
background
before
i
come
to
say
in
the
record
with
--
the
crucial
items
or
say
the
some
of
the
crucial
items
formed
these
documents.
now,
on
page
98
–
94,
you
see
judge
hayes'
finding
of
fact
number
33.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
page
94
of
the
record.
so
far
as
i
know
is
--well,
controversy
that
that's
a
faithful
and
accurate
reproduction
of
that
finding
of
fact.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
on
days
other
than
holidays
in
the
middle
of
the
finding
of
fact.
you
see
the
--
on
page
94,
do
you
see
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
of
the
record.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
both.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
days
other
than
holidays
and
weekends
and
greens
fees
are
a
dollar
and
quarter.
white
citizens
were
permitted
to
play
without
being
members
by
paying
fees
above
set
forth
and
without
paying
the
extra
dollar
and
without
any
questions
being
put
to
them.
and
the
plaintiffs
applied
to
be
given
the
same
privilege,
they
were
refused
on
the
ground
that
they
were
not
members
but
primarily
because
of
their
color.
plaintiffs
laid
the
greens
fees
on
the
table
in
the
club
house,
went
out
to
play
and
after
they
got
through
third
hole,
the
pro
in-charge
of
the
golf
course
ordered
them
off
and
they
insisted
they
have
the
right
to
play
and
would
not
get
off
unless
they
were
arrested
by
an
officer
whereupon
the
pro
had
them
arrested
and
they
were
tried
and
convicted.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
correct.
there
is
no
controversy
about
what
happened
in
this
case.
as
i
understand
the
rules
of
this
court
which
is
(inaudible)
against
maryland,
(inaudible)
versus
illinois
decided
last
term
that
where
there
are
no
conflicts
of
testimony
that
this
court
is
not
bound
by
the
conclusion
drawn
by
the
lower
courts
including
its
verdict
of
the
jury.
now,
on
page
92
of
the
record,
here's
the
declaratory
judgment
in
the
federal
case.
it's
the
third
paragraph
of
our
brief.
as
far
as
i
know
that
there
is
no
question
about
that
being
faithful
and
accurate
reproduction
of
--
that
declaratory
judgment.
whereas
you
see
the
court
said
that
this
will
actually
(inaudible)
on
the
plaintiffs
there,
appellants
here,
defendants
in
the
criminal
case
represented
a
constitutional
rights
and
that
they
have
been
unlawfully
denied
because
of
race
and
color.
now,
the
next
item
to
which
i
would
like
to
refer
you
comes
from
the
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court
itself,
i
think
it's
about
line
11
from
the
bottom
on
page
115
or
the
record.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
115.
on
the
facts
was
--
presented
to
him,
judge
hayes
issued
an
oral
enjoining
racial
discrimination
in
the
use
of
golf
course.
now
there
are
two
things
about
that;
number
one,
there
are
prior
to
state
supreme
court
who
could've
filed
that
by
ignoring
outside
the
record
and
looking
at
the
decree
and
injunction
which
was
just
one
document,
the
bottom
part
of
it
was
the
injunction
the
part
was
just
a
declaratory
judgment
which
is
--
you
see
on
page
92
of
the
record,
but
the
crucial
thing
about
that
is
--
it
seems
to
me
and
--
and
we
have
asked
ourselves
a
thousand
times,
is
it
conceivable
great
and
distinguished
judge
like
an
honorable
johnson
j.
hayes
would
have
issued
an
order
forbidding
discrimination
at
this
golf
course
where
no
racial
discrimination
existed.
if
as
the
state
would
have
this
court
believe
that
its
agencies
have
been
(inaudible)
circumspect
in
opening
this
golf
course
to
every
citizen
without
into
regard
to
race
and
color,
is
it
conceivable
that
judge
hayes
would
have
enjoined
what
did
not
exist
at
this
golf
course.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
exactly,
mr.
justice
harlan.
and
as
--
further
substantiation
of
it,
in
the
second
paragraph
of
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
on
page
115,
supreme
court
itself
said
although
defendants
have
the
record
in
that
case
identified
and
there
is
no
place
in
this
record
that
the
state
supreme
court
could
find
a
(inaudible)
identified
that
all
of
the
place
that
have
been
able
to
find
where
the
supreme
court
could
have
found
that
those
records
were
identified
was
in
the
transcript
in
the
trial
court
photographed
a
content
of
which
--
in
the
brief
97
and
98.
now,
on
this
matter
of
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
it's
fundamentally
the
defendant's
job
as
i
understand.
i
am
not
an
authority
on
north
carolina
law
but
that
is
my
understanding,
it
is
the
defendant's
duty
to
make
up
the
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
it
did
not
contained
them
in
--
in
the
sense
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
in
the
sense
of
having
been
offered
as
these
exhibits
6
and
7.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
not
this
particular.
as
i
understand,
i
was
--
i
was
not
in
the
state
case
was
designed
stand
at
no
--
no
motion
was
made
to
add
these
particular
documents
to
the
record.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
i
didn't
quite
understand
that
mr.
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
do
you
mean
did
they
include
the
federal
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
in
fact,
it
did
not
include
the
fact
that
they
were
identified
when
the
supreme
court
says
that
at
the
top
of
page
115
that
if
they
were
identified,
the
only
place
they
could
find
that
would
be
examining
something
outside
the
record.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
identified.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
this
is
a
reproduction,
most
of
this
off
the
record
that
was
before
supreme
court.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
exactly.
that's
--
i
would
like
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
to
the
solicitor
--
the
prosecuting
solicitor.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
correct.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
if
--.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
well,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
first
if
i
may
be
permitted,
i
would
like
to
suggest
the
number
of
questions
in
our
brief
that
manifest
the
time
we're
not
permit
and
we
would
appreciate
it
very
much
if
the
court
would
consider
all
those
questions
which
we
have
and
i
--
an
opportunity
to
the
argument
as
submitted
on
the
brief.
now
on
the
question
of
collateral
of
estoppel
is,
a
file
prior
to
judgment
at
the
state,
it
confuses
the
question
of
a
estoppel
and
collateral
estoppel
in
the
supremacy
on
this
federal
judgment
which
is
not
based
upon
the
question
of
estoppel
at
all
although
the
--
the
supremacy
clause,
we
understand
that
it
makes
this
judgment
supreme
as
a
matter
of
supremacy
and
not
because
of
any
question
of
estoppel.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
it's
--
it's
quoted
in
full
as
collateral
--
i
mean
the
--
on
page
92
of
the
record,
the
full
declaratory
judgment
is
quoted
in
full
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
no,
sir.
we
are
saying
that
these
acts
by
virtue
of
this
declaratory
judgment
became
impressed
--
in
view
of
the
impression
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
hanson
case
(inaudible)
of
federal
constitutional
law
upon
them
in
the
same
way
we
believe
that
the
labor
contract
did
in
that
case.
however,
that
the
federal
court
having
jurisdiction
of
this
case
could
in
fact
determined
well
in
that
--
these
specific
acts
were
constitutionally
protected
and
that
several
months
after
when
these
warrants
were
drawn
--
and
they
withdrawn
months
after
that
determination
had
been
made
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
that's
correct
--
that's
correct.
there
were
three
criminal
proceedings
in
this
case,
and
the
last
one
under
these
warrants,
the
warrants
would
be
december
2nd,
1957
whereas
the
judgment
of
employments
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
judge
hayes'
decision
came
down
on
june
the
28th,
1957
(inaudible).
now
if
i
may
--
because
as
i
understand
because
i'm
not
in
any
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
i
cannot
answer
that,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
black
except
to
say
what
counsel
have
said.
they
said
that
--
they
understood
the
north
carolina
procedures
to
be
that
the
exception
that
you
mentioned
in
talking
with
the
attorney
general
did
preserve
any
questions
as
to
improper
exclusion
of
those
records
and
they
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
supreme
court
on
page
14
of
their
brief
as
they
--
was
proper
to
do.
that
brief
was
no
printed
in
the
record
where
it
was
set
up
and
requested
to
be
presented
but
the
clerk
thought
that
it
was
not
properly
printed,
but
it
is
in
the
original
transcript
on
full
on
page
14,
they
said
the
court
erred
in
refusing
to
admit
the
defendant's
exhibit
6
and
7
as
set
out
in
exception
22.
these
exhibits
were
under
the
decree
of
the
findings
of
fact,
conclusions
of
law
and
opinion
of
the
federal
district
court
in
the
simkins
case
and
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
same
case.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
for
the
reason
that
the
supreme
court
of
north
--
first,
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
as
we
understand
its
rule
has
almost
unlimited
discretion
to
consider
matters
coming
before
it.
in
the
case
aycock
against
richardson,
they
said
moreover
the
clerk
of
this
court
at
its
direction
as
obtained
citing
material
from
the
superior
court.
now,
in
reliance
upon
this
statement
in
the
brief,
the
counsel
in
the
state
supreme
court
did
tender
these
records
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
asking
it
to
take
judicial
notice
of
them
but
they
were
available
and
we
believe
--
as
i
read
the
supreme
court's
cases
that
it
could
have
within
its
discretion
--
looked
at
those
records.
it
could
have
--
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
it's
on
--
toward
the
end
of
the
--
end
of
the
record,
motion
to
take
judicial
notice.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
page
128
or
the
record.
from
the
argument
of
this
case
solely
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
in
connection
request
in
judicial
notice
certified
counsel
saved
in
records
under
united
states
court,
that
saying
construction
of
the
constitution
law
of
united
states
upon
the
--
identical
facts
involved
in
this
appeal.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
it
appears
in
the
brief
of
the
--
of
appellants
in
that
case
through
the
appellants
here
on
page
14.
they
said
what
those
6
and
7
were.
mr.
j.
alston
atkins
i
don't
think
it
does,
mr.
justice
black,
although
i
--
i
am
(inaudible),
but
it
describes
them
--
we
believe
that
this
is
fair
case
of
racial
discrimination
which
the
state
supreme
court
could
have
reached
and
that
--
and
this
court
is
not
precluded.
now,
from
considering
these
questions,
we
set
out
reasons
more
elaborately
and
--
in
our
brief
which
we
hold
the
(inaudible).
thank
you.
