m.

are
your
clients
sole
plaintiffs
in
that
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
of
your
clients
were
involved?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
to
show
that
these
two
exhibits
6
and
7
were
in
fact
before
the
trial
judge
in
the
sense
that
they
were
identified,
in
the
sense
that
he
was
asked
to
make
a
ruling
upon
them,
in
the
sense
that
he
knew
what
the
exhibits
were
and
that
the
denial
of
the
ruling
to
--
of
admissibility
which
appears
on
page
79
constitutes
or
deprives
what
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
says
of
being
an
adequate
state
ground.
in
other
words,
that
these
exhibits
were
physically
in
the
record,
do
you
argue
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
did
--
did
the
record
before
the
supreme
court
contained
exhibits
6
and
7
as
marked
for
identification
even
though
they
were
not
admitted
into
evidence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
record
that
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
contained
these
exhibits
6
and
7
as
exhibits
that
were
marked
for
identification,
even
though
they
had
been
excluded
by
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
as
being
admissible
in
evidence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
they
physically
include
two
exhibits
marked
for
identification?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
did
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
excuse
me.
in
that
connection,
i
have
been
looking
at
page
79
which
were
mrs.
kennedy,
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
your
honor
please,
we
would
like,
if
possible,
to
have
a
ruling
on
whether
or
not
these
would
be
admissible.
court
i
am
going
to
sustain
the
objection
as
to
those
two
exhibits
that
is
6
and
7,
and
the
6
and
7
presumably
or
what
the
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
on
115
referred
to
the
exhibits
as
having
been
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
identified
but
not
physically
received
in
evidence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and,
it
was
page
79
of
the
record
that
you
printed
it
here,
part
of
the
record
that
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
what
you
have
--
what
you
have,
at
least
you
can
argue
what
you
have
is
before
the
supreme
court
a
proffer
of
two
exhibits
6
and
7,
a
ruling
against
their
immiscibility
buy
a
record
that
lacks
the
physical
exhibits
themselves
marked
for
identification,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
--
what
effect
do
you
attribute
to
the
supreme
court's
understanding
of
what
those
exhibits
were
by
a
virtue
of
the
statement
on
115?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
115
of
this
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
the
supreme
court
says,
â€œdefendants
move
to
set
aside
the
verdict
of
jury
is
the
basis
for
their
emotion.
they
rely
on
the
simkins
against
the
city
of
greensboro,
that's
the
federal
case
decided
by
the
united
states
district
court
on
march
1957.
although
defendants
have
the
record
in
that
case
identified
they
did
not
offer
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
point
is
that
--
in
that
on
all
this
--
there
is
nothing
to
identify
exhibits
6
and
7
with
the
judgment
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
in
the
federal
court
proceeding,
that's
your
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
make
that
this
record
were
federal
court
record
were
before
the
state
supreme
court,
what
would
be
the
effect
of
it
in
your
view
as
--
as
to
the
collateral
estoppel
as
far
as
relitigation
of
that
issue
is
concerned?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
such
a
doctrine?
justice
john
m.
harlan
one
gets
the
impression
perhaps
mistakenly
from
reading
of
your
supreme
court's
opinion
that
you
do
have
a
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
and
that
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
this
record
was
properly
before
the
court
that
the
vice
that
they
found
or
the
difficulty
they
found
in
applying
the
state
doctrine
was
because
the
state
itself
has
not
been
a
party
to
the
proceeding
in
the
federal
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
it
indicated
such
things
that
in
this
opinion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
didn't
reach
any
of
these
questions
because
of
their
view
as
to
the
deficiency
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
