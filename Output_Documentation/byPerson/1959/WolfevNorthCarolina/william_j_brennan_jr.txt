justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
fact
that
this
direct
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
and
acquittal
on
the
record
as
it
stood.
as
i
understand
it,
the
north
carolina
law
is
that
racial
discrimination
had
that
been
established
as
the
reason
for
the
exclusion,
would
have
been
a
complete
defense
to
these
charges.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although,
it
was
not
in
the
course
of
this
case,
i
forgotten,
but
were
there
not
two
opinions
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
was
laid
down
that
if
you
prove
racial
discrimination
that
would
be
a
complete
defense
to
these
criminal
charges.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
any
event
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whenever
it
was,
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
rule,
i
gather,
is
it
not,
in
north
carolina?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
that's
what
i
said
was.
well
now,
as
i
--
i
think
you
just
said
that
there
was
other
evidence
upon
which
there
might
have
been
an
acquittal
establishing
racial
discrimination,
notwithstanding
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence
you've
been
talking
about.
and
yet,
do
i
understand
that
there
was
no
motion
for
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
on
that
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
was
that?
at
the
--
at
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
close
of
the
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tomorrow,
we're
about
closing
time,
would
you
point
out
in
the
record
where
that
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
means
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
the
attorney
general's
brief
and
whether
what
--
that
you
have
say
to
this.
it's
in
the
fact
that
while
this
record
has
says
you
have
pointed
it
out
to
it,
it's
nevertheless
also
the
fact
that
6
and
7
physically
were
not
before
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
and
that
the
fact
that
they
were
not
before
that
court
explains
largely
the
conclusion
it
has
reached,
then
i
think
the
attorney
general
does
not
argued
that
since
they
were
not
before
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
that
its
his
judgment
we're
reviewing,
we
can't
take
any
notice
of
them
either.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
suggest
we
look
at
them,
mr.
atkins
by
taking
judicial
notice
of
the
federal
record,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
specifically,
is
there
anything
contained
in
6
and
7
which
you
say
is
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
of
course
that
was
never
before
the
jury,
was
it?
this
is
--
as
i
understand
it
--
is
contained
in
your
motion
to
set
aside
the
verdict
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
after
the
trial
was
closed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general
is
the
essence
of
the
state's
position
here
that
this
judgment
of
the
--
your
supreme
court
turns
on
a
state
ground
namely
a
failure
to
comply
with
state
rules
of
procedure
either
at
the
trial
or
in
perfecting
the
appeal
and
therefore,
that
it's
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
deal
with
the
constitutional
question?
