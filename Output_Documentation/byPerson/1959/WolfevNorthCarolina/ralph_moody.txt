mr.
ralph
moody
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
get
down
to
the
state's
contentions
in
the
matter
which
i
would
hope
to
state
very
succinctly
in
a
very
few
words,
you're
trying
my
state
here
and
i
know
you
want
to
try
fairly
and
the
--
i'm
asking
you
therefore
to
try
them
on
the
things
they
have
before
them,
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
had
before
them
and
what
the
trial
court
had
before
it.
now,
they
have
put
into
the
--
to
their
brief
excerpts,
editorials
from
newspapers.
they
put
in
to
their
brief
parts
of
the
findings
of
fact
that
they
say
that
judge
hayes
made
in
the
district
court.
they
have
put
into
their
brief
parts
of
the
declaratory
judgment
that
they
read
to
you
and
they
have
also
put
into
their
brief
excerpts
from
a
manual,
if
i
recall
correctly
from
the
work
progress
of
administration.
now
i
respectfully
say
to
this
court
that
none
of
those
things
at
all
were
ever
before
that
trial
court.
none
of
those
things
were
before
the
trial
court
insofar
as
this
record
shows
at
all.
certainly,
he
will
not
contend
to
you
that
the
portions
of
the
manual
from
the
works
progress
administration
which
i
think
maybe
was
used
in
the
federal
trial
whatever
into
it
introduced
in
evidence,
none
of
these
at
newspaper
editorials
and
these
petitions
and
proceedings
that
they
say
were
had
before
the
city
council
of
greensboro,
were
ever
put
before
the
trial
court
in
order
--
did
it
ever
appear
before
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
sir.
i
go
to
--
so
i
say
that,
too.
now,
--
mr.
ralph
moody
none
of
these
--
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
get
to
what
you
are
referring
to.
you're
referring
to
these
editorials
and
--
mr.
ralph
moody
they
were
not
offered
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
say
this
record
--
from
this
record,
we
can't
tell
whether
there
--
mr.
chief
justice,
whether
ever
was
such
a
--
an
offer
made
or
not.
mr.
ralph
moody
page
79,
mrs.
kennedy
says
“if
your
honor,
we
would
like
if
possible
to
have
a
ruling
on
whether
or
not
these
would
be
admissible.”
now
--
mr.
ralph
moody
“i
am
going
to
sustain
the
objection
as
to
those
two
exhibits
that
is
6
and
7.”
mr.
ralph
moody
there
is
an
exception
there
but
we
don't
--
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
we
don't
know
what
6
and
7
were.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
identified
6
and
7.
what
you
heard
is
what
he
says
to
--
that
6
and
7
are.
mr.
ralph
moody
the
supreme
court
--
i
don't
know
where
he
was
reading
from
in
that
opinion.
mr.
ralph
moody
115?
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
think
they
got
that
from
another
part
of
the
record
over
here
which
i
wish
to
call
to
your
attention.
i
think
they
got
that
from
the
testimony
at
--
of
the
deputy
clerk
that
they
have
there
at
that
time.
mrs.
myrtle
cobb,
i'm
looking
now
your
honor
at
page
71,
mrs.
cobb
is
there
and
she
said
that
she
had
some
records.
she
said
that
it's
her
duty
to
keep
in
possession
the
public
possession,
the
records
in
the
case
of
simkins
and
others
against
the
gillespie
park
golf
course.
i
have
all
(inaudible)
there's
no
papers
in
that
case.
now,
there's
nothing
there
that
says
their
exhibit
6
and
7
may
it
please
the
court.
the
6
and
7
at
all
is
nothing
there
that
ties
them
with
6
and
7.
she
said
she
happened.
then,
counsel
get
off
into
this
question
which
my
friend
here
talked
about
the
other
day
about
examining
people
as
an
adverse
witness
under
gs8-50.
and
as
you
will
see
if
you
go
to
72,
they
get
off
into
the
question
of
about
an
adverse
witness
and
we
don't
hear
about
anything
anymore
until
we
get
over
to
where
mrs.
kennedy
says
that
she'd
like
to
get
a
ruling
on
these,
whatever
these
are
and
the
court
says
that
he
was
sustained
to
6
and
7.
and
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
which
is
correct,
i
want
them
to
be
the
--
i
subscribe
to
equal
protection
law
and
i
don't
think
that
constitutionally,
we
can
set
up
a
new
procedures
or
event,
new
motions
or
things
to
exclude
them
for
the
setting
up
their
federal
rights.
i
don't
think
that
for
a
minute,
but,
as
suggested
by
mr.
frank
--
justice
frankfurter,
they
have
charge
of
the
preparation
of
the
case
what
we
call
the
case
on
appeal.
we
have
two
things.
we
have
a
record
which
consists
of
the
permanent
part
of
the
case,
things
that
we'd
like
to
think
of
as
permanent,
the
bill
of
indictment,
the
judgments
and
things
like
that
and
then
we
have
what
the
case
--
about
we
call
the
case
on
appeal
which
consists
of
the
various
flexible
fluid
things
that
transpire
at
the
trial,
motions,
evidence,
rulings
on
evidence
and
things
of
that
nature.
now,
it
was
up
to
them
to
make
up
their
case
on
appeal.
had
i
been
in
their
position,
it
would
have
been
up
to
me,
and
i
say
that
this
is
not
a
--
an
unusual,
unheard
of
anomalous
procedure
for
an
attorney
who's
get
--
making
up
their
own
case
on
appeal
if
they
thought
some
exhibits
had
been
excluded
that
when
--
wrongfully
excluded
and
to
which
they
are
--
wanted
an
appellate
review
that
they
would
make
an
offer
or
tender
of
those
exhibits
for
the
basis
of
a
exception.
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
that's
the
same
thing
isn't
it
your
honor
of
with
or
without
these
would
be
--
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
it's
alright.
well
--
mr.
ralph
moody
you
do
--
yes,
it
would.
if
you
had
them,
that's
a
proper
way
to
make
an
assignment
error
if
you
got
the
exhibits.
you
should
--
mr.
ralph
moody
they
should
be
attached
so
the
appellate
court
can
see
what
you're
complaining
about.
mr.
ralph
moody
and
yes,
that
is
my
point.
and
of
course
you
--
i
think
you
have
a
state
record.
i'm
not
sure
if
certified
here,
i
believe
it
is
and
you
will
see
there
is
no
record
of
6
--
exhibit
6
and
7
in
the
state
record
at
all.
the
exhibits
were
there
that
were
sent
up.
now,
i
think
they're
bound
by
the
same
rules
of
practice
that
i
would
be
or
anybody
else,
and
i've
tried
to
cite
in
my
brief
to
show
this
court
that
north
carolina
is
simply
following
things
that
it's
been
following
all
the
time
and
that
it
is
invented
no
new
or
anomalous
practice
to
try
to
exclude
these
people
from
a
federal
--
raising
a
federal
question
at
all.
it's
the
same
practice
that
all
lawyers
have
to
follow
and
it's
the
same
thing
that's
been
followed
all
the
time.
the
same
thing
is
true
about
their
questions
--
they
had
some
question
over
there
if
the
--
beginning
when
he
was
raising
this
part
about
closing
mouths
of
witnesses.
(inaudible)
those
were
our
witnesses
that
they
were
cross
examining
and
the
prosecutor
simply
objected
to
evidence
of
--
he
tried
this
case
like
any
other
trespass
case
this
record
shows
it.
he
simply
objected
the
evidence
of
some
other
colored
people
that
had
been
down
there
and
that
was
sustained
and
they
say
that's
closing
the
mouths
of
witnesses.
at
that
time,
they
had
never
told
the
court
that
now
we
wish
to
make
a
defense.
they
had
filed
a
motion
to
quash.
i'm
not
overlooking
that
but
the
motion
to
quash
is
relying
upon
the
efficacy
of
this
declaratory
judgment
obtained
in
the
federal
district
court
and
they
rely
on
that
as
an
estoppel
among
other
things
and
of
course
an
attempt
to
raise
a
question
on
form
of
jeopardy
and
various
things
like
that.
but
in
the
motion
to
quash,
i
--
i
there
have
set
forth
in
my
brief
case
after
case
to
show
your
honors
that
the
motion
to
quash
is
not
the
way
to
raise
a
question
and
that
pertains
that
matters
that
appear
on
the
face
of
the
record.
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
north
carolina
law
in
practice
and
i
have
cited
the
cases
way
back
--
considerable
distance
back
before
a
racial
questions
ever
came
to
any
prominence
or
--
in
southern
states
or
in
north
carolina
to
show
that
that
is
the
practice.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
sir.
that's
i
think
fairly
put
--
rather
fairly
states
my
position.
you've
raised
of
course
--
tried
to
raise
other
questions
here
that
i
don't
think
that
the
--
i
should
burden
this
court
with
going
into.
i
do
call
your
attention
but
let
me
comment
just
one
minute
on
the
facts
that
they
say
--
talk
about
the
facts
over
the
great
deal.
greensboro
and
the
city
administrative
unit
which
is
an
educational
unit
leased
the
land
to
gillespie
park
golf
course.
now,
it
wasn't
as
bogus
lease,
a
straw
lease
or
a
fictitious
lease
i
say
for
this
reason.
the
directors
of
the
corporation
pledged
their
own
faith
and
credit
and
put
over
$100,000
into
the
development
of
the
property
and
built
a
small
club
house
and
the
rules
are
stated
the
--
they
have
their
rules
for
membership.
i
have
in
my
set
forth
in
my
brief
a
list
of
things
that
these
gentlemen
are
now
raising
for
the
first
time
and
were
not
presented
to
my
courts,
who
you're
now
passing
upon,
one
of
them
was
the
sufficiency
or
the
adequacy
of
the
rules
where
they
too
nebulous
and
too
broad
and
did
they
contain
too
much
arbitrary
discretion?
they
haven't
raised
that
question,
the
trial
judge
didn't
pass
on
that,
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
didn't
pass
on
such
questions
as
that.
now,
they
had
a
rule
that
people
could
play
that
were
belonged
to
golf
clubs
affiliated
with
the
carolina
golf
association
and
as
to
the
rules
themselves
as
stated
in
the
bylaws,
there
is
--
i
can
consider
some
ambiguity.
i
don't
see
them
right
now
but
when
you
look
at
them,
there
is
some
ambiguity
and
it
--
here
in
the
article
i,
membership
in
this
corporation
should
be
restricted
to
members
or
approval
to
board
of
directors.
for
membership
in
the
club,
there
should
be
two
types
of
membership
and
that
was
the
$60
plus
taxes
and
so
on.
and
then,
they
said
the
golf
course
and
its
facilities
should
be
used
only
by
members
and
invited
guests,
members
in
good
standing
of
other
golf
clubs,
members
of
the
carolina
golf
association
and
people
--
or
the
professional
and
his
invited
guest.
there's
an
ambiguity
there
as
to
whether
that
golf
clubs
who
affiliate
with
the
carolina
golf
association
or
whether
it's
a
person
who
is
a
member
in
good
standing
in
the
golf
club
can
--
would
also
be
entitled
to
play
in
this.
in
either
case,
it
makes
no
difference
in
this
case
because
these
gentlemen,
three
of
them
who
weighed
something
around
100
pounds
had
decided
to
got
down
there
and
play
golf
and
--
they
didn't
go
down
there
and
say,
“now
–
here
is
a
letter
showing
that
we're
in
a
good
standing
with
the
nocho
golf
club”
which
one
of
them
says
they
belonged
to,
only
one
of
the
defendants
testified,
they
presented
no
letter
to
the
pro
or
anybody
else
like
that,
saying
“we
are
members
in
good
standing
of
this
golf
club.”
they
just
came
down
--
75
cents
down
pushed
in
and
said
“we're
going
to
play
golf”
and
they
were
prosecuted
for
trespass
which
judge
hayes
said
it
was
a
--
he
seems
to
think
in
his
opinion
according
to
the
federal
supplement
that
it
was
a
matter
of
discrimination.
but
that
was
never
presented
and
we
don't
--
even
if
they
--
is
the
same
incident
that
was
adjudicated
in
the
federal
court.
even
if
it
was,
we
don't
know
under
what
circumstances
they
went
in
and
what
they
did
even
in
exercising
a
right
to
say
we're
entitled
to
exercise.
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
there
were
–
frankly
i
am
not
familiar
with
their
golf
courses.
you
see,
i
don't
--
we
don't
prosecute
these
cases
below.
they
--
there
was
another
course
there,
the
nocho
golf
course
that
--
which
most
of
the
colored
people
play.
there
was
there
--
and
there
maybe
others
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
ralph
moody
oh
at
this
time?
we
do
have
that
evidence
in
the
record.
i
think
your
honor,
i
made
--
i
didn't
state
that
clearly.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
we
do
have
that.
mr.
bass
testified,
they
came
down
to
and
said
“we
offered
him
75
cents”
and
said
“we're
going
to
play
golf”
and
he
said
“you
can't
play.”
i
believe
he
told
him
i'm
not
too
sure
of
this.
i
think
he
told
them
they
were
not
members
or
--
and
they
said
they
formed
a
line
he
said,
they
form
a
sort
of
a
rough
of
line,
threw
75
cents
down
on
a
counter
of
a
little
club
house
that
they've
built
there
and
proceeded
to
go
out
and
play
golf.
mr.
ralph
moody
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
ralph
moody
when
the
pro
came
back
who
is
the
manager
of
--
mr.
bass
told
him
about
it
and
the
pro
went
out
and
told
him
twice
i
think.
they
said
they
knew
who
the
members
of
the
club
were,
merely
all
of
it
--
all
of
the
members
were
and
these
gentlemen
never
made
then
who
came
down
there
and
did
this
never
made
any
(inaudible)
membership.
they
said
they
were
going
to
play
golf
and
it
was
quite
evident
of
course
that
they've
been
intended
to
make
such
a
move
at
this
for
sometime
because
simkins
testified
that
over
a
year
and
a
half
ago,
he'd
written
his
lawyer
about
it
and
that
he
had
a
letter
from
his
lawyer.
under
this
statute
if
they
had
a
bona
fide
license
to
enter
on
the
property
or
a
bona
fide
belief
that
they
had
a
license
to
go
on
the
property
and
the
defense
might
have
been
different
as
to
the
technical
defense
is
in
the
statute.
they
never
claimed
that
at
all.
simkins
said,
“i
have
a
letter
from
a
lawyer
about
it”
and
he
never
--
they
never
offered
the
letter
in
evidence
--
evidently
thought
that
what
he
read
in
this
letter
was
license
for
him
to
do
what
he
wanted
to
do.
whether
here
then
that
was
all.
they
never
claimed
membership
at
all.
mr.
ralph
moody
he
said
that
in
his
opinion.
yes,
sir.
he
said
that.
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
know
what
the
findings
are
but
that's
in
the
opinion
they
were
find
--
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
his
opinion
but
--
i
don't
think
you'll
find
--
if
you're
going
to
consider
that,
i
--
it's
my
position
all
the
time
that
that
is
not
before
the
court.
but
--
i
don't
think
you'll
find
that
he
ever
found
anything
like
that.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
sir.
that
is
in
the
opinion.
a
whole
lot
of
things
are
in
the
opinion,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
said
that
he
had
a
lot
of
common
knowledge
about
things.
he
put
that
in
there,
too
and
a
whole
lot
of
things
that
i
claim
that
if
you're
going
to
try
my
court
and
my
state
that
we
are
not
bound
by
it.
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
admit
it.
it's
my
contention
that
that
is
matter
in
which
the
state
is
not
bound
by
at
all.
the
state
of
north
carolina
is
not
bound
of
that
finding
as
a
matter
or
a
collateral
estoppel
or
as
any
estoppel
at
all.
they
keep
talk
about
these
being
agencies
of
the
state.
one
was
a
private
corporation,
the
other
was
a
city
administrative
unit
and
the
other
was
a
municipal
corporation.
but
the
state
of
north
carolina
has
--
as
i've
stated
in
my
brief
to
you,
has
not
authorized
those
agencies
to
stand
in
judgment
for
it
in
criminal
matters
and
in
criminal
proceedings.
now,
if
--
if
the
state
can
be
bound
by
this
as
an
estoppel,
assuming
first
of
all,
let's
assume
they
had
it
and
properly
all
there
and
properly
approved
and
offered
it
in
evidence,
i
still
say
that
it
was
proper
to
exclude
it
and
that
the
--
a
state
constitutionally,
as
i
say
doesn't
--
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
is
not
required
to
extend
recognition
to
the
doctrine
if
it
doesn't
want
to.
mr.
ralph
moody
we
have
such
a
doctrine
as
been
applied
in
civil
cases.
i
think
i
believe
i
point
that
out,
but
i
say
that
a
state
constitutionally
does
not
have
to
extend
the
doctrine
and
it
does
not
have
to
accept
criminal,
civil
issues
and
criminal
cases.
we
have
tried
to
discuss
that
in
our
brief
and
i
received
--
i
thought
a
great
deal
of
comfort
from
the
statement
in
your
opinion
against
hoag
--
hoag
against
new
jersey.
for
there,
i
believe
you
will
find
language
in
which
you
said
it
was
very
doubtful
or
there
was
very
grave
doubt
as
to
whether
a
state
had
to
extend
to
or
recognize
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel.
now,
i'm
aware
that
you
have
considered
it
in
old
(inaudible)
case
of
the
(inaudible)
case
in
which
i
believe
there
was
a
statement
that
--
that
even
the
issues
adjudicated
in
a
civil
case
might
be
available
in
the
criminal
case.
but
i
would
call
to
your
attention
there
sir
that
you
were
dealing
with
federal
courts
all
the
way
through.
mr.
ralph
moody
you're
correct
--
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
i
think
so.
but
i
would
call
to
you
attention
though
that
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel,
as
far
as
i
know
of
it
in
my
jurisdiction
has
only
been
applied
in
civil
cases,
the
adjudicating
of
issues
as
between
the
same
parties
or
perhaps
privies
of
those
--
were
connected
or
related
in
the
determining
and
concluding
matters,
but
i
haven't
found
it
in
where
it
has
ever
been
applied
that
a
civil
--
a
conclusion
or
an
adjudication
in
a
civil
matter
has
been
reached
--
has
been
placed
over
and
used
as
an
estoppel
against
the
state
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
sir
it
did
not.
i
don't
think
you
find
any
such
authority
of
such.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
think
so
except
they
did
consider
the
question
of
judicial
notice.
mr.
ralph
moody
and
there,
i
will
not
debate
that
unless
someone
wishes
for
me
to
go
in
to
any
of
it.
it's
suffice
it
to
say
that
they
--
they're
now
asking
for
judicial
notice
make
up
for
all
of
these
and
--
as
some
of
the
question
while
ago
about
these
motions
that
were
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
they
filed
a
motion
suggesting
a
diminution
of
the
record,
but
they
never
said
anything
about
this
in
that
motion
at
all.
they
thought
that
their
record
has
been
sufficiently
shown
appeals
--
appeal
interest
from
the
municipal
county
court
which
had
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
ralph
moody
and
they
thought
that
they
were
short
there
on
the
appeal
i
did,
too.
i
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
it
but
the
supreme
court
held
against
me
and
--
with
them.
but
i
call
it
to
your
attention
that
when
they
were
interested
in
diminutions
of
the
record,
they
didn't
seem
to
be
interested
in
--
in
the
record
in
the
federal
court
at
all.
