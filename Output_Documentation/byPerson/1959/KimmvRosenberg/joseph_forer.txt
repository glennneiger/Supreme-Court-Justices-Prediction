mr.
joseph
forer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
from
the
ninth
circuit.
the
question
is
whether
the
petitioner
--
the
question
is
whether
the
petitioner
was
lawfully
held
ineligible
for
suspension
of
deportation
because
he
refused
on
the
basis
of
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
testify
in
the
suspension
proceeding
whether
he
was
or
ever
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
the
petitioner
is
a
korean.
in
1928,
he
was
admitted
to
the
united
states
on
a
student's
visa
and
he
went
to
school
in
college
here
and
received
bachelor's
and
master's
degrees.
by
1937,
he
was
ready
to
return
to
korea
and
rejoin
his
wife
and
child.
in
that
year,
however,
war
broke
out
between
japan
and
china.
petitioner
was
unwilling
to
return
to
korea,
which,
of
course,
at
that
time,
was
part
of
the
japanese
empire,
because
he
thought
that
if
he'd
return
to
korea,
he
is
a
technician,
would
be
put
to
work
for
the
japanese
war
machine.
mr.
joseph
forer
that
was
in
1937
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
that
the
war
broke
out.
he
was
ready
to
go
back.
but
if
he
went
back,
it
would
have
meant
that
he
would
--
would
have
been
helping
the
japanese
war
effort
against
china
and
he
was
anti-japanese.
so
he
continued
in
school
for
another
year
up
until
july
1938.
and
after
july
1938,
he
stopped
attending
school
and
took
full-time
employment
in
this
country.
and
in
july
1938,
the
same
reason
that
it
induced
him
not
to
go
back
to
korea
in
1937
still
existed.
in
1938,
he
didn't
want
to
go
back
because
of
the
japanese-chinese
war,
so
he
continued
on
here.
now,
that
made
him
deportable
because
he
had
overstayed
his
student's
visa.
so,
deportation
proceedings
were
instituted
against
him
and
this
culminated
in
an
order
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
in
1943.
and
this
order
found
him
deportable
for
overstaying
his
status
as
a
student.
it
also
granted
him
the
privilege
of
voluntary
departure
and
this
he
did
on
a
finding
by
a
hearing
officer
and
which
was
an
essential
finding
for
granting
the
privilege
that
he
had
been
a
person
of
good
moral
character
for
the
preceding
five
years.
but
by
this
time,
we
were
at
war
with
japan
and
departure
was
impossible,
so
the
petitioner
stayed
on
(inaudible),
and
he
worked
in
defense
industry
as
a
chemist.
in
july
of
1945
--
mr.
joseph
forer
he
--
he
was
ordered
deported.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
was
granted
the
privilege
of
voluntary
departure,
but
he
couldn't
avail
himself
up
and
nobody
denies
that.
he
--
he
couldn't
go
to
--
to
japan
when
we
were
at
war
with
japan.
mr.
joseph
forer
oh,
no.
mr.
joseph
forer
not
only
that.
as
i
was
about
to
say,
the
government
hired
him.
he
stayed
on.
first,
he
worked
in
defense
industry
as
a
chemist.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
fbi
cleared
him
to
work
on
a
secret
government
contract.
and
in
july
of
1945,
the
office
of
strategic
services
recruited
him
as
a
volunteer
for
a
projected
hazardous
mission.
he
was
recruited
by
the
oss,
a
group
of
men,
koreans
who
are
to
be
trained
to
be
dropped
as
american
spies
in
japanese
occupied
korea.
he
was
trained
for
this
mission,
but
just
as
his
group
was
scheduled
to
depart
overseas,
japan
surrendered.
so
he
never
did
go
overseas.
everything
was
conspiring
to
keep
him
here.
so
in
september
of
1945,
he
left
the
office
of
strategic
services
and
he
returned
to
private
employment.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
they
were
just
--
he
was
just
going
to
be
a
spy.
he
was
now
anxious
to
return
to
korea
because
the
war
was
over.
japan
had
been
defeated.
and
he
wanted
to
get
back
to
his
native
country.
but
although
the
war
was
over,
exit
permits
were
still
required.
and
they
were
required
until
late
1948.
so
he,
on
several
occasions,
applied
to
the
state
department
to
get
an
exit
permit
and
he
never
received
a
reply
and
never
got
the
permit.
as
a
result,
he
was
still
here
in
the
united
states
on
july
1,
1948.
on
that
date,
congress
liberalized
the
statutory
provisions
for
suspension
of
deportation.
among
other
things,
the
act
of
july
1,
1948
dropped
the
racial
restrictions
which
previously
had
excluded
koreans,
among
other
nationalities,
from
any
possible
consideration
for
suspension.
so
that
as
a
result
of
the
july
1,
1948
amendment,
for
the
first
time,
he
had
a
chance
for
suspension
of
deportation.
and
in
june
of
1950,
the
immigration
service,
on
its
own
volition,
ordered
the
deportation
proceedings
reopened
so
as
to
allow
him
to
apply
for
suspension
of
deportation
under
the
liberalized
legislation.
now,
by
this
time,
the
petitioner
didn't
want
to
return
to
korea.
the
syngman
rhee
regime
was
then
in
power
in
korea.
the
petitioner
had
become
the
editor
of
a
korean
language
newspaper
in
california.
this
newspaper
was
an
anti-rhee
paper.
and
the
petitioner
was
afraid
that
if
he
went
back
to
korea,
he
would
incur
physical
persecution.
so
he
didn't
want
to
go
back.
and
now,
that
the
suspension
possibility,
for
the
first
time,
became
available
and
the
immigration
service
reopened
it
so
as
to
permit
him
to
apply
for
suspension,
he
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
he
did
apply.
mr.
joseph
forer
his
wife
and
child
had
come
over
here
the
same
time
he
had,
but
they
had
come
over
on
visitor's
visas.
he
had
come
over
on
a
student
visa.
now,
while
he
was
still
attending
school,
their
temporary
visitor's
visa
expired.
they
tried
to
get
permission
to
remain
on
with
him
even
though
their
visitor's
visas
had
expired.
the
immigration
service
refused
to
extend
their
visitor's
visas,
so
they
had
to
go
back.
he
kept
--
he
stayed
on
expecting
to
finish
his
education
and
then
go
back
and
rejoin
them.
and
for
the
various
(inaudible)
that
i
have
mentioned,
he
never
did
get
back.
mr.
joseph
forer
and
his
wife
and
child,
they're
in
korea
when
last
(inaudible).
now,
the
suspension
statute,
under
which
he
applied
and
which
is
the
statute
which
is
applicable
here,
was
first
enacted
by
the
alien
registration
act
of
1940.
and
this
added
sections
19
(c)
and
19
(d)
to
the
basic
immigration
act
of
1917
and
section
19
(c)
was
amended
by
this
liberalizing
legislation
that
i
referred
to
of
july
1,
1948.
now,
section
19
(c),
as
amended,
prescribed
certain
conditions
before
a
deportable
alien
is
eligible
for
suspension.
if
and
when
these
conditions
are
met,
the
attorney
general
then
has
discretionary
power
to
grant
or
deny
suspension.
if
the
conditions
are
not
met,
the
attorney
general
does
not
have
discretion
to
grant
suspension.
so
far
as
the
petitioner
here
was
concerned,
the
relevant
conditions
of
eligibility
under
section
19
(c)
where
that
they
have
resided
in
the
united
states
for
seven
years,
that
he
have
resided
here
on
july
1,
1948
and
that
he
proved
that
he
proved
that
he
had
been
a
person
of
good
moral
character
for
the
five
years
preceding
his
application.
but
in
addition,
section
(c)
says
that
except
as
provided
in
section
(d)
or
subsection
(b)
and
section
(d)
or
subsection
(d),
section
19
(d)
says
that
the
suspension
provisions
of
19
(c)
are
not
applicable
to
aliens
who
are
deportable
under
certain
specified
statutes.
and
among
these
various
specified
statutes
was
the
anarchist
deportation
statute
of
1918.now,
after
the
petitioner
filed
his
application
for
suspension,
but
before
it
was
enacted
upon,
this
anarchist
deportation
statute
of
1918
was
amended
by
the
internal
security
act,
the
mccarran
act
of
september
23,
1950.
and
the
mccarran
act
amended
the
anarchist
deportation
statute
so
as
to
require
the
deportation,
not
only
of
aliens
who
were
--
who
were
or
had
been
anarchists,
but
also
of
aliens
who
were
or
had
ever
been
members
of
the
communist
party.
now,
the
effect
of
this,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
is
that
it
automatically
enlarged
the
scope
of
section
19
(d)
so
as
to
withhold
from
suspension
the
suspension
provisions
of
19
(c),
persons
who
are
deportable
on
account
of
communist
party
membership.
now
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
joseph
forer
if
--
if
an
alien
is
eligible
under
the
statute,
he
has
the
right
to
invoke
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
attorney
general
has
exercised
his
discretion,
if
we
prevail.
up
to
now,
he
has
not.
now,
hearings
were
held
in
1950
and
1951
to
determine
whether
the
petitioner
should
be
granted
suspension.
and
there's
no
question
but
that
the
petitioner
met
the
resident's
requirements
of
section
19
(c)
for
eligibility
for
suspension.
an
evidence
was
introduced
at
the
hearing
bearing
on
the
requirements
of
eligibility
that
the
applicant
proved
good
moral
character
for
the
five
years
proceeding
the
application.
and
the
evidence
on
this
subject
included
good
character
affidavits
from
persons
who
were
well
acquainted
with
the
petitioner.
it
included
the
petitioner's
own
testimony
about
his
history.
it
included
a
letter
from
the
office
of
strategic
services
which
praised
him
for
his
service
with
the
agency.
it
also
included
a
report
of
a
field
investigation
by
the
immigration
service
and
a
report
by
the
fbi.
these
reports
disclosed
that
petitioner
had
no
criminal
record
and
that
no
derogatory
information
about
him
have
been
discovered
at
all.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
record
contains
no
evidence
of
any
kind
which
adversely
reflects
on
petitioner's
character.
all
the
evidence
is
to
the
effect
that
he
is
and
was
a
person
of
good
moral
character.
but
during
the
hearing,
the
examining
officer,
he
was
the
equivalent
of
a
prosecutor,
as
distinguished
from
the
hearing
office,
during
the
hearing,
the
examining
officer
asked
the
petitioner
if
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
now,
it
has
not
suggested
that
this
question
was
asked
because
the
service
had
any
information
that
petitioner
was
in
fact
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
the
question
was
asked
out
of
the
blue
as
it
were.
now,
when
petitioner
was
asked
this
question,
“are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
his
attorney
objected
on
the
ground
that
the
question
violated
the
first
amendment
and
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
on
the
advice
of
counsel
and
on
those
grounds,
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer
the
question.
when
the
hearing
was
resumed
at
a
later
date,
the
examining
officer
asked
the
petitioner,
toward
the
end
of
the
hearing,
if
he
then
wanted
to
answer
the
question,
“are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
if
petitioner
said,
“no.”
he
would
decline
to
answer
again.
this
time,
he
just
mentioned
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
he
didn't
say
anything
--
he
didn't
incorporate
the
first
amendment.
then,
the
examining
officer
asked
him
whether
he
had
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
on
the
advice
of
his
counsel
at
his
deportation
hearing,
the
petitioner
again
--
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer
the
question
as
to
the
past
on
the
basis
of
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
now,
the
hearing
officer
denied
suspension
of
deportation.
and
from
there,
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
adjudications
division
of
the
service.
that
was
then
no
longer,
but
at
that
time,
they
had
this
intermediate
administrative
appeal.
and
the
adjudications
division
denied
suspension,
then
the
appeal
went
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
denied
suspension.
then,
the
petitioner
brought
an
injunction
suit
in
the
district
court
in
los
angeles
to
review
the
deportation
order
and
the
order
denying
suspension.
and
the
district
court
sustained
the
denial
of
suspension
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
it.
so
there
have
been
five
different
levels
of
decision
here,
three
administrative
levels
and
two
judicial
levels.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
have
no
--
the
--
the
--
under
the
regulations,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
has
the
final
say
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
unless
they
ask
to
go
on
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
attorney
general
himself
take
it.
but
there's
no
question
that
when
he
went
through
the
board,
he
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies.
nothing
--
it
did
not
administratively
go
beyond
the
board.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
test
on
that
subject
and
--
that
if
--
if
the
alien
here
did
not
test
it.
i
mean,
he
made
no
such
claim
in
any
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
joseph
forer
which
regulation?
mr.
joseph
forer
it
may
--
mr.
joseph
forer
it
may
be.
all
i
know
is
that
--
that
the
way
he
has
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
it
maybe
important
but
the
area
here
never
claimed
that
access
to
different
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
it
may
be,
but
i
--
i
just
don't
see
it.
now,
these
five
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
i
mean
i
don't
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
no,
sir.
now,
these
five
different
levels
of
adjudication
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i
--
i
should
think
he
could
not.
but
as
far
as
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
i
know,
he
did
not
say
that
here.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
he
didn't.
he
accepted
the
board
of
immigrations
appeals'
decision
as
being
the
decision
of
the
attorney
general.
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
that
was
permissible
under
that
then
administrative
regulation.
now,
at
these
various
levels
of
decision,
there
were
various
reasons
given
for
holding
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
now
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i'm
sure
of
that.
now,
four
different
reasons
were
given
for
denying
suspension
varying
with
the
particular
agency
or
court
which
passed
on
the
question.
and
i'll
take
up
these
four
different
reasons
one
at
a
time.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
--
the
government
has
not
taken
the
position
that
we
should
have
gone
to
the
attorney
general,
and
the
alien
has
never
taken
the
position
that
he
was
foreclosed
from
going
to
the
attorney
general.
now,
that
is
--
up
to
now,
that
has
not
been
into
the
case.
and
what
--
all
i
meant
was
when
i
said
i
don't
see
it,
is
that
i
don't
see
how,
so
far
as
the
alien
is
concerned,
he
can
now
claim
that
he
was
foreclosed
from
going
to
the
attorney
general
because
if
he
was
foreclosed
from
going
to
the
attorney
general,
he
accepted
that
foreclosure.
and
that's
why
i
don't
see
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
that
is
possible.
now,
as
i
already
said,
a
precondition
to
eligibility
for
suspension
under
section
19
(c)
is
that
the
alien
proved
that
he
was
a
person
of
good
moral
character
for
the
preceding
five
years.
now,
the
hearing
officer
ruled,
and
i
want
to
quote
his
ruling
on
this
subject,
“in
view
of
his
failure
to
answer
the
questions
propounded,
the
respondent,”
meaning
the
petitioner
here
or
the
alien,
“the
respondent
has
not
affirmatively
proved,”
i
guess
i'll
resume
that
later
on.
mr.
joseph
forer
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
if
the
court
--
the
hearing
officer
ruled
that
the
petitioner
had
failed
to
establish
eligibility
toward
suspension
under
the
statute,
because
he
had
failed
to
make
the
precondition
to
eligibility
of
proving
good
moral
character
for
the
preceding
five
years.
and
the
ruling
reads
as
follows
and
i
quote,
“in
view
of
his
failure
to
answer
the
questions
propounded,
the
respondent,
meaning
the
petitioner
here,
has
not
affirmatively
proved
that
he
has
been
a
person
of
good
moral
character
for
the
past
five
years.”
now,
this
finding
was
approved
by
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
the
ground
was
not
relied
on
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
it
is
not
now
defended
by
the
government
in
its
brief.
on
the
other
hand,
the
government
had
not
concede
that
the
ground
is
wrong.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
well,
i'm
trying
to
take
up,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
each
one
of
the
various
grounds
at
a
time
and
that
will
be
a
later
ground.
mr.
joseph
forer
i'm
just
trying
to
get
rid
of
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
move
on
this
ground
first.
this
--
the
finding
that
he
didn't
prove
good
moral
character,
and
limiting
myself
to
that
for
the
moment,
is
clearly
indefensible.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record,
including
the
services
on
field
investigation,
shows
good
moral
character.
there
is
absolutely
no
contrary
evidence
showing
bad
moral
character.
and
the
hearing
officer
based
his
ruling,
not
on
any
insufficiency
or
inadequacy
in
the
evidence
on
record,
but
expressly
and
solely
on
the
failure
to
answer
the
questions.
and
the
failure
to
answer
the
questions
was
not
evidence.
as
to
this
ground,
this
case
is
governed
by
the
konigsberg
case.
in
konigsberg,
an
applicant
for
admission
to
the
bar,
submitted
good
character
evidence,
but
he
refused,
on
first
amendment
grounds,
to
answer
questions
about
communist
party
membership.
the
california
board
of
bar
examiners
held
that
because
of
this
refusal
to
answer,
the
applicant
had
failed
to
prove
good
moral
character
and
had
failed
to
show
that
he
did
not
advocate
violent
revolution.
the
court
held
that
the
--
that
giving
such
effect
to
silence
as
to
overcome
affirmative
evidence
of
good
character
was
so
unwarranted
and
that
the
exclusion
of
the
applicant
was
so
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
that
it
denied
the
applicant
due
process
and
equal
protection.
i
want
to
turn
now
to
the
second
ground
given
for
denying
the
petitioner's
eligibility
for
suspension.
subsection
19
(d),
as
i've
pointed
out,
provides
that
the
suspension
provisions
of
subsection
(c)
are
not
applicable
to
aliens
who
are
deportable
under
various
statutes
including
the
anarchist
deportation
act.
and
the
anarchist
deportation
act
was
amended
to
include
members
of
the
communist
party.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
by
refusing
to
answer
the
communist
questions,
the
petitioner
had
failed
to
carry
his
burden
approving
that
he
was
not
deportable
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
therefore,
had
failed
to
carry
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
was
not
disqualified
from
suspension
relief
under
the
provisions
of
subsection
19
(d).
now,
this
ground
also
was
not
advanced
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
and
i
think
that
the
ground
is
wrong,
and
clearly
wrong,
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
petitioner
did
not
have
the
burden
approving,
the
nonapplicability
of
the
anarchist
deportation
act,
and
the
other
statutes
referred
to
in
section
19
(d).
since
he
did
not
have
the
burden
of
proof,
he
cannot
be
held
disqualified
for
failing
to
carry
a
burden
that
was
not
his.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
sir.
there's
a
difference
between
the
eligibility
requirements
set
out
in
section
19
(c).
and
this,
i
think,
will
answer
your
question,
justice
whittaker.
19
(c)
establishes
eligibility
requirements
which
are
stated
as
preconditions
to
the
power
of
the
attorney
general
to
grant
suspension
in
his
discretion.
19
(d)
is
an
exception
to
19
(c),
not
a
precondition,
but
an
exception.
now,
there
is
no
question
but
that
as
to
the
eligibility
preconditions
of
19
(c),
the
alien
has
the
burden
of
proof.
but
the
contrary
is
true,
with
regard
to
the
exceptions
provided
by
section
19
(d).
and
this
is
so
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
in
general,
persons
don't
have
the
burden
of
negativing
exceptions.
the
person
claiming
that
an
exception
is
applicable
has
the
burden
of
proving
it.
that
is
reinforced
in
the
present
case
by
the
contrast
and
the
text
between
the
preconditions
which
the
alien
must
prove
and
has
the
burden
of
proving,
and
the
different
way
in
which
exceptions
were
carved
out
by
section
19
(d).
furthermore,
if
the
alien
has
a
burden
of
proving
that
he
is
not
within
the
exception
on
19
(d),
then,
then
he
has
unreasonable
burden
of
proving
not
only
a
negative,
but
a
whole
host
of
negatives.
he
has
prove
not
only
that
he's
not
or
never
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
he
also
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
was
not
an
anarchist,
that
he
was
not
a
dope
kind
of
smuggler
and
so
forth.
now,
the
fact
is
that
it
is
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
congress
intended
that
the
applicability
of
section
19
(c)
would
be
a
triable
issue
in
the
suspension
hearing
as
distinguished
from
the
deportation
hearing.
i
suggest
that
congress
assume
that
if
an
alien
were
in
fact
within
one
of
the
deportable
classes
referred
to
in
section
19
(d),
that
would
have
been
an
issue
which
would
have
been
charged
and
proved
against
them
in
the
deportation
preceding
problem.
and
congress
just
did
not
seem
to
have
in
mind
the
possibility
that
the
alien
might
have
been
charged
in
the
deportation
proceeding
with
one
cause
for
deportation
but
of
course
not
with
in
19
(d),
but
that
he
might
also
be
subject
to
deportation
for
another
uncharged
cause,
which
was
within
section
19
(d).
maybe
it
wasn't
charged
because
it
was
not
known
to
the
service,
maybe
it
wasn't
charged
because
the
service
couldn't
carry
the
burden
of
proof.
but
i
think
all
congress
had
in
mind
was
at
section
19
(d)
would
automatically
preclude
or
even
holding
suspension
hearings
in
cases
where
the
charge
for
deportation
was
a
--
a
cause
such
as
anarchism,
communism
and
so
--
prostitution,
of
course,
listed
in
19
(d).
otherwise,
if
you
assume
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
that
the
alien
must
prove
in
the
suspension
proceeding
that
he
is
not
deportable,
on
the
various
grounds
referred
to
in
section
19
(d),
you
get
what
is
virtually
an
impossible
situation.
consideration
of
a
suspension
application
becomes
necessary
only
after
the
alien
is
found
deportable.
the
suspension
hearing
is
only
ancillary
to
the
deportation
hearing.
under
the
court
of
appeals
theory,
the
ancillary
deportation
hearing,
the
ancillary
hearing,
the
suspension
hearing
has
to
become
a
kind
of
second
deportation
hearing.
and
in
the
second
deportation
hearing,
you
have
to
determine
with
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
alien
that
the
alien
is
not
deportable
on
some
ground
additional
to
that
already
charged
and
found
against
them.
well,
i
just
don't
think
that
congress
so
intended
it
and
it
--
it
somewhat
is
an
unworkable
system
and
i
think
therefore,
it
is
fair
to
conclude
that
the
alien
does
not
have
the
burden
of
disproving
19
(d).
and
therefore,
that
ground
advanced
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong.
now,
let
me
come
the
third
ground
in
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
am
not
--
i
think
the
regulation
is
ambiguous
because
i
am
not
sure
whether
they
represent
the
regulation
to
condition
--
to
the
burden
of
proving
eligibility.
it
also
means
the
burden
of
disproving
disqualification
under
19
(d)
as
distinguished
from
proving
a
--
a
conformance
to
the
eligibility
conditions,
preconditions
of
19
(c).
if
the
regulation
is
broad
enough,
to
put
on
the
alien
the
burden
of
disproving
19
(d),
then,
i
say
that
is
invalid
because
it
is
not
justified
by
the
statute.
now,
let
me
go
to
the
third
reason.
and
this
is
the
reason
that
is
at
least
principally
and
perhaps
solely
briefed
by
the
government,
and
that
was
advanced
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
the
reason
--
this
reason
goes
as
follows.
they
say
the
questions
answered
of
the
petitioner
were
pertinent
questions
and
were
proper
for
the
attorney
general
to
answer,
because
after
all
were
proper
for
the
attorney
general
to
ask
because
after
all,
if
--
if
the
alien
in
fact
gave
an
affirmative
answer,
then
he
wouldn't
--
he
would
be
disqualified.
now,
they
say
after
all
the
attorney
general
had
a
right
to
ask
the
questions
they
were
pertinent,
not
only
that,
but
the
alien
is
seeking
a
favor.
therefore,
the
petitioner
had
a
duty
to
answer
the
questions.
by
refusing
to
answer
he
breached
the
duty
and
this
made
him
ineligible
eligible
for
suspension.
and
i
think
that
is
a
fair
summary
of
the
argument
of
the
argument
of
the
--
made
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
by
the
government's
brief.
and
the
shorter
it
is
that
the
board
of
immigration
rule,
board
of
immigration
appeals
rule,
that
is
to
say
condition
to
eligibility
that
the
alien
answer
questions
of
the
attorney
general
if
those
questions
are
pertinent
to
section
19
(d).
now,
i
think
this
reason
is
wrong
in
the
first
place
because
it
creates
a
condition,
a
requirement
for
suspension
eligibility
that
is
not
provided
by
the
statute
and
that
goes
beyond
the
conditions
that
are
provided
by
the
statute.
congress
provided
certain
specific
conditions
before
an
alien
could
be
eligible
for
suspension.
it
also
spelled
out
the
disqualifying
exceptions
of
19
(d).
now,
congress
did
not
spell
out
the
discretionary
factors
which
the
attorney
general
could
take
into
account
once
the
alien
was
found
eligible.
but
what
we're
talking
about
now
is
eligibility,
because
petitioner
was
found
ineligible
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
found
that
the
attorney
general
could
not
exercise
his
discretion.
now,
the
fact
is
that
although
the
statute
specifies
the
conditions
for
eligibility,
and
although
it
specifies
the
disqualifying
factor
of
alien
deportable
under
19
(d),
it
does
not
say
that
one
of
these
conditions
is
if
the
alien
answered
questions
of
the
attorney
general
or
that
he
cooperate
with
the
attorney
general.
mr.
joseph
forer
did
they?
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
i
--
i
think
that
is
correct,
but
i
don't
think
that
as
part
of
his
right
to
investigate
and
ascertain,
he
had
the
right
to
put
substantive
and
important
conditions
on
eligibility
which
are
in
addition
to
those
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
forer
well
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
he's
delegates
it
then.
and
i
will
comeback
to
that
--
that
question
of
the
delegation
power
at
the
end,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
i
may
defer
that
issue
for
a
moment.
now,
nor
does
the
statute
say
that
a
refusal
to
answer
the
questions
of
the
attorney
general,
or
a
refusal
to
cooperate
with
the
attorney
general
is
a
disqualifying
effect
that
--
within
section
19
(d)
or
anything
else.
assuming
that
the
--
it
was
proper,
for
the
attorney
general
to
inquire
whether
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
body,
and
assuming
that
the
questions
were
pertinent,
it
doesn't
follow
that
the
petitioner
had
a
duty
to
answer
the
questions
nor
does
it
follow
that
the
consequence
of
his
not
answering
is
that
he
became
ineligible
for
having
this
application
considered.
on
the
contrary,
even
if
a
general
obligation
to
cooperate
were
read
into
the
statute
and
if
something
that
has
to
be
read
in
to
be
read
in,
this
would
be
overwritten
in
this
case
by
the
fifth
amendment
which
gives
a
privilege
to
be
silent
in
circumstances
where
there
is
otherwise
a
duty
to
answer.
but
i
say
that
there
are
good
reasons
why
the
court
should
not
read
into
the
statute
a
provision
that
answering
the
attorney
general's
questions
even
to
the
point
of
surrendering
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
a
condition
to
eligibility
for
suspension.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
it
depends
on
the
--
did
he
--
in
what
he
said
did
he
hold
that
the
alien
was
ineligible,
or
did
he
say
he
was
not
going
to
do
this
as
a
matter
of
discretion
because
there
is
a
difference.
if
the
question
is,
could
the
attorney
general
say
that
he
is
ineligible
to
help
me
exercise
my
discretion
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
because
he
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
because
i
can't
tell,
whether
he
is
disqualified.
mr.
joseph
forer
within?
well,
because
he
hasn't
shown
that
he
is
not
within
19
(d)
then,
i
say
that
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
attorney
general.
that
is
my
argument.
yes,
sir.
otherwise,
first
you
have
to
read
a
condition
in
the
statute
that
isn't
there.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
to
put
such
a
condition
into
the
statute
requires
a
policy
judgment
preferring
the
policy
of
the
anarchist
and
communist
deportation
statute
to
the
policy
of
the
fifth
amendment.
on
the
one
end
--
mr.
joseph
forer
it
depends
on
what
he
cannot
tell,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
if
the
alien
has
--
if
he
cannot
tell
on
matters
on
which
the
alien
has
the
burden
of
proof,
then
of
course,
he's
--
it
may
find
the
alien
ineligible.
if
he
cannot
tell
on
matters
on
which
the
alien
does
not
have
the
burden
of
proof,
he
may
not
find
the
alien
ineligible
whether
or
not
he
may
use
that
as
a
factor
in
his
discretion,
is
an
entirely
different
question.
but
here,
we
are
just
dealing
with
eligibility.
now,
if
you
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i
--
i'm
afraid
i
didn't
catch
that.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
attorney
general?
mr.
joseph
forer
i
think
not,
but
actually
in
practice,
the
determination
--
in
the
present
case,
we
don't
have
that
situation.
in
the
present
case,
they
found
the
alien
ineligible.
and
the
question
of
what
discretion
would
have
been
exercised
is
not
before
--
before
us
because
it
has
not
been
exercised.
mr.
joseph
forer
there
certainly
is.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
think
--
think
you
can
circumvent
it
completely
it.
or
you
mean
the
attorney
general
could?
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
absolutely
certain
in
my
mind
that
he
could.
i
don't
think
he
should
and
i
don't
think
that
this
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
on
that
assumption,
i
don't
think
he
would.
maybe
he
could,
but
i
don't
think
he
would.
mr.
joseph
forer
but
if
that's
the
way
he
feels
maybe
he
should
exercise
his
discretion.
mr.
joseph
forer
all
right,
but
--
and
he
has
--
he
has
no
right
to
hold
the
alien
ineligible
because
the
statute
gives
conditions
for
eligibility.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
that
would
be
an
abusive
discretion.
but
i
don't
think
he
is
entitled
to
say
that
red-haired
people
are
--
that
you
have
to
be
red-haired
or
you
have
to
be
black-haired
before
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
think
so,
but
at
the
moment,
i
wasn't
saying
that.
at
the
moment,
i
was
saying
that
it
seems
to
me
you
should
not
read
into
the
statute
a
condition,
the
effect
of
which
is
to
strip
the
alien
of
his
privilege
as
a
condition
to
getting
suspension,
because
this
imposes
adverse
consequences
on
the
utilization
of
the
privilege.
now,
it's
true
that
if
you
don't
read
in
the
condition,
it
is
possible
that
despite
the
attorney
general's
investigatory
resources,
some
areas
might
get
suspension
even
though
they
would
be
disqualified
if
all
the
facts
were
known.
but
i
don't
think
it
is
a
hard
choice
between
favoring
the
privilege
and
favoring
the
anarchist
deportation
act.
first,
i
think
the
constitutional
policy
should
be
favored
over
the
statutory
policy.
and
secondly,
i
think
from
the
varied
case
this
court
has
seen,
the
communist
deportation
provisions
don't
appear
to
be
or
something
short
of
being
decided.
now,
this
does
not
mean
that
the
attorney
general
must
hopelessly
watch
aliens
flaunt
the
statute
by
getting
suspension
relief
to
which
they
are
not
entitled
just
by
keeping
quiet.
in
the
first
place,
the
alien
must
affirmatively
prove
that
he
needs
the
eligibility
conditions
which
are
in
the
statute
and
which
are
listed
in
subsection
18
(c)
including
the
requirements
as
there
as
this
includes
character.
in
the
second
place,
if
the
attorney
generals
inquiries
aren't
answered
by
the
alien,
the
attorney
general
can
ask
them
of
somebody
else.
and
in
fact,
he
does.
in
the
third
place,
if
an
alien
is
uncooperative,
the
attorney
general
can
take
that
into
account
in
determining
whether
he
should
grant
suspension
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
if
the
alien
doesn't
give
a
good
reason
for
non-cooperation
or
his
reason
does
not
have
constitutional
justification,
the
attorney
general
can,
if
he
wishes,
deny
suspension
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
i
-
i
don't
deny
it.
i
don't
say
that
the
attorney
general
did
anything
wrong
in
asking
him
the
question.
i'm
just
saying
that
he
can't
disqualify
the
alien
for
refusing
to
answer
it
on
the
base
of
his
privilege.
the
fact
that
it's
a
very
direct,
the
natural
thing
to
do,
doesn't
make
it
a
condition
to
the
statute.
and
the
fact
is
that
my
view
with
the
statute
gives
the
attorney
general
more
power
and
more
authority
than
the
government's
view.
the
government
view
makes
it
impossible
for
the
attorney
general
to
exercise
his
discretion
whenever
the
alien
refuses
to
answer
relevant
questions.
no
matter
how
good
a
reason
the
alien
has,
no
matter
whether
the
reasons
are
constitutionally
protected,
no
matter
what
all
the
circumstances
are.
now,
in
the
lerner,
beilan
and
nelson
cases,
this
court
held
that
a
municipality
has
the
power
to
discharge
an
employee,
for
refusing
on
constitutional
grounds,
including
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
to
answer
questions
on
communist
membership
which
the
municipality
had
asked
or
had
directed
the
employee
to
answer.
now,
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
these
cases
do
not
support
the
government
here.
in
the
first
place,
those
cases
merely
upheld
the
power
of
the
state
to
discharge
employees
for
a
silence
claimed
to
show
a
lack
of
candor
or
insubordination.
but
the
initial
question
here
is
not
a
question
of
power.
it's
a
question
of
what
congress
did
in
the
statute.
and
as
i
have
tried
to
point
out,
congress
prescribed
only
certain
factors
which
would
disqualify
an
alien
for
suspension.
it
did
not
prescribe
non-cooperation
with
the
immigration
service
as
a
disqualification.
and
in
the
interest
of
the
constitutional
privilege,
you
should
not,
is
what
i
have
been
saying
erect
such
a
requirement
by
interpretation.
in
the
second
place,
i
think
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
do
what
you
permitted
the
states
to
do
in
lerner,
beilan
and
nelson.
those
cases
did
not
directly
collide
with
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
although
there
were
strong
dissents
of
these
cases.
but
those
cases
didn't
directly
collide
with
the
privilege
because
you've
held
that
the
privilege
is
not
finding
on
mistakes,
but
it
does
collide
directly
with
the
fifth
amendment
for
the
federal
government
to
make
an
alien
ineligible
for
suspension
on
account
of
a
privilege
of
silence.
and
it
--
and
you
can't
say
that
this
after
all,
is
not
a
sanction
on
the
use
of
the
privilege
because
the
sanction
is
applied
on
account
on
the
alien's
silence
without
regard
to
whether
he
was
silent
on
the
basis
of
a
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment,
or
whether
he
was
silent
for
other
reasons.
because
after
all,
the
thing
that
is
privileged
by
the
fifth
amendment
is
the
silence.
it
is
not
the
words
by
which
the
right
to
the
silence
is
involved.
so,
if
as
in
this
case,
you
impose
denial
of
suspension
eligibility
because
of
a
silence
which
admittedly
was
privileged
by
the
constitution,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
imposing
an
adverse
consequence
on
the
use
of
the
fifth
amendment,
or
the
use
of
the
privilege.
and
that
is
something
that
i
don't
think
the
attorney
general
was
authorized
to
do,
that
i
don't
think
should
be
done.
in
fact,
i
think
it
is
compulsion
and
therefore
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
at
an
intermediate
stage,
the
--
the
commissioner's
office,
in
an
intermediate
appeal
between
the
special
inquiry
officer
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
held
not
that
the
alien
was
ineligible
but
that
they
would
deny
a
suspension
on
the
grounds,
abuses
discretion
because
the
claim
is
privileged.
both
the
government
and
i
feel
that
that
question
is
not
here
because
although
this
was
an
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
commissioners
office,
it
was
not
an
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
which
under
the
regulations
was
the
last
delegate
of
the
attorney
general.
if
the
question
is
here,
i
--
i
think
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
and
even
unconstitutional,
but
since
we
have
both
agreed
that
it's
not
here
since
i
am
convinced
that
this
is
not,
i'll
leave
the
matter
to
my
brief.
but
i
do
want
to
return
now
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
raised.
the
first
thing
i
want
to
point
out
is
that
the
hearing
officer
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
held
that
the
petitioner
was
ineligible
for
suspension
and
deportation.
they
did
not
and
under
their
theory,
they
could
not
exercise
the
attorney
general's
discretion
because
they
expressly
held
that
the
petitioner
did
not
qualify
for
discretionary
consideration.
for
this
reason
alone,
it
seems
to
me,
this
case
does
not
involve
any
problem
as
to
whether
an
alien
who
is
found
eligible
for
discretionary
consideration
is
entitled
to
have
the
discretion
exercise
not
merely
by
the
attorney
general's
delegates
but
by
the
attorney
general
himself.
mr.
joseph
forer
it
is
--
i
don't
think
it
is
any
worse
than
the
deportation
finding
itself
which
is
universally
accepted
and
approved,
can
be
delegated
by
the
attorney
general.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
right
to
an
appeal
to
the
attorney
general
from
the
finding
of
deportability.
mr.
joseph
forer
oh,
yes
the
statute
gives
the
attorney
general
the
power
to
deport
and
he
has
delegated
that
to
a
special
--
not
under
the
present
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
i
think
so
and
that
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
and
--
and
i
looked
--
i'll
--
i'll
come
to
that
in
the
circumstance
of
this
case
in
a
moment.
but
first,
i
want
to
mention
the
regulations
which
were
in
effect
at
this
particular
time.
under
the
regulations,
then
in
effect,
and
for
that
matter,
under
the
regulations
now
in
effect,
there's
been
a
change
in
wording,
but
not
in
substance.
decisions
by
the
board
if
immigration
appeals,
whether
they
were
decisions
on
deportability
or
decisions
denying
suspension,
were
not
appealable
by
the
alien.
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday,
the
decisions
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
were
final
unless
the
attorney
general
himself
decided
to
take
the
case
from
the
board
or
unless
the
chairmen
of
the
board
or
the
majority
of
the
board
decided
to
refer
the
case
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
joseph
forer
well
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
know,
but
that's
what
the
regulation
said.
now,
the
regulations
also
said
that
the
commissioner
could
request
that
the
case
be
referred
to
the
board.
under
the
present
regulation
--
the
commissioner
make
such
a
request.
it
could
be
referred
to
the
attorney
general.
under
the
present
regulation,
if
the
commissioner
makes
such
a
request,
it
will
automatically
go
to
the
attorney
general.
under
the
regulations
that
were
in
effect
to
1951,
the
request
had
to
be
concurred
in
by
the
board.
the
attorney
general's
regulations
directed
the
board
to
ask
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
to
exercise
his
discretion
expressly.
and
in
jay
against
boyd,
decided
by
this
court
in
1956,
this
court
expressly
held
that
even
as
to
the
exercise
of
discretion,
there
is
no
doubt
it
said,
that
the
discretion
conferred
upon
the
attorney
general
by
statute
in
suspension
cases,
maybe
delegated
by
him
to
hearing
officers,
which
review
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
need
not
the
exercised
by
the
attorney
general
in
person.
now,
what
happened
here
is
that
the
alien
talked
--
the
only
administrative
remedy
that
was
available
under
the
regulation,
if
the
regulation
was
invalid
in
jay
against
boyd
indicates
that
is
not
invalid.
nevertheless,
as
far
as
the
alien
is
concern,
he
exhausted
his
remedy,
i'll
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
court,
please.
mr.
davis,
referred
to
a
distinction
between
questions
as
to
present
membership
and
past
membership
as
having
some
relevance
to
the
issue
of
whether
good
conduct
or
moral
character
was
true.
but
in
the
konigsberg
case
the
questions
which
were
asked
konigsberg
and
which
konigsberg
refused
to
answer
related
both
the
present
and
past
membership.
and
the
court
said
that
it
was
not
only
unwarranted
but
so
unwarranted
as
to
be
unconstitutional
to
treat
that
silence
as
overweighing
affirmative
evidence
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case
as
far
as
the
court
below
is
concerned.
secondly,
it
is
not
accurate
to
say
that
section
19
(d)
provides
that
the
suspension
provisions
are
not
applicable
to
persons
who
are
or
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
it
says
that
it
does
not
apply
to
persons
who
are
deportable
because
of
communist
party
membership,
among
others.
now,
there
are
certain
types
of
communist
party
membership
which
are
not
deportable
as
this
court
has
proven
in
the
grunewald
case
and
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
and
what
is
emphasized
is
just
the
point
i
made
that
if
you
are
going
to
go
into
19
(d),
it
completely
dislocates
the
suspension
proceeding
because
it
becomes
a
whole
proceeding
involving
the
facts
relating
to
the
court
below.
finally,
i
just
don't
think
that
the
situation
is
advanced
by
comparing
the
situation
here,
the
pardon
and
by
referring
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
matter
of
a
favor
or
grace.
the
fact
is
that
this
is
a
favor
that
congress
made
provisions
for
and
congress
said
certain
people
are
eligible
for
the
favor.
it
is
also
a
fact
that
the
court,
this
court
has
held
and
lower
courts
have
held
that
the
exercise
of
discretion
after
eligibility
has
been
determined,
is
subject
to
court
review
as
to
abuse
of
discretion.
but
i
still
have
to
see
where
the
government,
in
addition
to
saying
that
the
man
was
asking
for
a
favor,
is
able
to
show
how
this
particular
alien
who
was
held
disqualified
for
that
failure,
failed
to
meet
any
of
the
conditions
for
the
favor
that
were
erected
by
congress.
thank
you.
