1937.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
his
conduct
was
not
surreptitious.
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--he
wasn't
hiding
or
anything
of
that
kind
from
the
--
chief
justice

we'll

now.

mr.
davis,
i
was
--
i
was
wondering
about
the
probation
situation
that
you
equated
this
to.
suppose
a
man
was
up
for
probation
under
a
statute,
that
said
that
the
probation,
a
person
who
would
--
thrice
been
convicted
of
a
--
of
a
felony
was
not
eligible
to
probation.
and
suppose
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
was
a
--
a
two-time
looser
and
the
--
the
judge
on
the
probation
hearing
asked
him,
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
felony?”
and
he
declined
to
--
to
answer.
would
that
support
a
judgment
by
the
court
that
the
man
was
ineligible
to
probation
because
he
had
failed
to
establish
that
he
was
not
twice
convicted
of
a
felony.
would
the
man
--
what
i'm
asking
is,
would
the
man
not
be
entitled
to
have
the
court
--
to
exercise
his
discretion
on
the
probation
by
saying,
“well,
i'm
not
satisfied
that
this
man
ought
to
have
probation,
but
still,
he
would
be
eligible
because
it
hadn't
been
established
against
him,
that
he
was
--
had
been
--
been
twice
convicted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
of
course,
he
could
exercise
his
discretion
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
its
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
davis.
mr.
forer.
