justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
--
was
any
step
taken
to
ask
if
the
attorney
general
himself
to
pass
on
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
it
--
has
it
been
tested
whether
--
since
the
statute
says
the
attorney
general
whether
the
man
was
dissatisfied
with
the
administrative
procedures
that
i
want
the
attorney
general
himself
to
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
it's
very
important
if
--
if
that
access
to
him
isn't
shut
off.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'd
say
it
may
be
important
to
this
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
you
don't
see
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
you
don't
see
it.
that
doesn't
answer
a
question
if
you
don't
see
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
says
the
attorney
general,
not
the
attorney
general
said
you
can't
get
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
he
--
if
you
think
he
couldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
think
he
could
not,
then
it's
a
relevant
question
to
put
it
mildly
why
you
didn't
--
why
you
didn't
seek
to
get
to
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
got
that.
could
you
--
either
you
or
mr.
davis
(inaudible).
i'd
like
to
see
that
regulation
because
to
me
it's
a
serious
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
the
statute
tells
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
says,
“you
can't
knock
at
my
door.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
you
say
you
don't
see
it,
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
that
--
that
lawyers
haven't
exhausted
what
is
the
necessary
administrative
procedure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
may
be
foreclosed
from
coming
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
congress
defined
the
procedure
or
the
evidentiary
mode
by
which
the
attorney
general
should
be
satisfied
or
if
the
conditions
are
fulfilled?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
how
you
still
ascertain
the
conditions
under
which
he
is
to
act
were
left
to
his
own
sense
of
appropriateness
into
the
ascertaining
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
do
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
--
i
come
back
to
my
question
of
yesterday.
how
can
his
delegates
determine
what
is
legal
limiter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
that
argument
means
that
if
the
attorney
general
assuming
you
have
done
this,
himself
found,
wrote,
“i
cannot
establish
whether
this
man
does
or
does
not
come
within
19
(d),
because
all
the
channels
of
communication
--
the
only
available
channel
of
communication
are
made
inaccessible
to
me,
and
therefore,
i
deny
the
grace
which
the
--
the
dispensation
of
which
congress
has
placed
in
my
chart.”
do
you
think
that
--and
he
couldn't
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
know
the
--
or
because
he
hasn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
nor
himself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
not
why
i
can't
tell
you
and
for
himself
within
the
relieving
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
question
is
as
a
matter
of
law
--
but
if
he
cannot
tell
--
if
he
hasn't
the
basis
of
making
up
his
mind,
he
must
grant
relief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
he
can't
just
close
his
mind
at
all
and
no
court
has
mandamus
and
to
disclose
his
mind
and
just
deny
the
application.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
need
not
just
close
his
mind,
he
just
denies
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
no
court
could
mandamus
in
order
to
set
forth
the
reason
for
his
denial
or
could
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
in
the
case
like
this,
there
is
really
an
effect
and
a
difference
in
finding
him
ineligible
and
denying
him
relief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
there
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although,
you
can
circumvent
completely
by
not
doing
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
the
attorney
general
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
should.
i'm
assuming
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
attorney
general
is
a
conscientious
official.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
is
doubtful
in
his
mind
and
he
may
have
a
good
hunch,
but
not
substantiated
as
it
would
be
in
the
court
of
law
because
the
issue
here
isn't
that
kind
of
substantiation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
work
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
he
exercises
discretion
because
he
has
ased
on
others
to
make
a
judgment
but
it
followed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that's
just
what
it's
saying?
i
--
i've
denied
it
because
he's
red
headed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
isn't
saying
that.
he
is
dealing
with
the
category
as
to
which
congress
had
imposed
a
duty
off
on
him.
and
he
says,
if
you
brought
my
means
of
establishing
that
that
category
is
satisfied
or
he
is
not
satisfied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you'
save
the
fifth
amendment
by
that
use
of
that
mode
of
discharging
a
duty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
worse
because
by
this
mode,
they
shut
off
an
opportunity
to
persuade
the
attorney
general,
that
he
can
exercise
his
discretion
because
he
has
lawful
power
to
do
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
statute
vest
specific
power
in
the
attorney
general?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
--
and
it
hasn't
held
that
if
a
person
wants
to
appeal
to
him,
he
--
it
wouldn't
lie
--
the
appeal
wouldn't
lie,
like
it
held?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
held
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how,
practically
could
he
take
it
himself
--
could
he
move
if
he
doesn't
know
anything
about
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
he
can
make
an
appeal
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
--
what's
the
citation
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
someone
referred
--
those
citations,
the
one
referred
to
those
--
those
--
the
statute,
the
one
referred
to
in
jay
against
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
jay
against
boyd,
was
it?
i
don't
think
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
--
like
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
1950s,
but
--
but
i
--
i.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
there
is
a
difference
to
me
between
delegating
the
--
the
ascertainment
of
facts
to
use
the
usual
categories
for
exercising
a
discretion
and
delegating
a
construction
of
the
statute
which
completely
bars
--
yes,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
a
while
ago,
exercising
the
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
argument
made
by
mr.
forer
here,
is
that
--
that
the
board
of
appeal
here
lay
down
a
rule
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
added
to
the
statute
a
restrictive
requirement
as
to
eligibility,
not
eligible
within
the
--
to
application
as
a
recognized
category,
but
constituting
or
infusing
a
new
category.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
think
that's
different
from
jay
against
boyd,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
quite
a
few,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
what
i
--
what
my
ears
heard
from
what
you
read
a
minute
ago,
that
statute
seems
to
be
explicit
as
though
congress
had
said
in
this
--
this
act
of
grace
maybe
exercised
either
by
the
attorney
general
or
anybody
whom
he
so
designate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
short
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
a
sense
of
guilt
because
if
you
are
right,
and
in
fact
you
are,
then
the
whole
foundation
of
my
dissenting
and
jay
against
boyd,
was
cut
from
under.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
impenitent
if
the
statute
doesn't
express
the
delegate
in
saying
that
if
such
power
is
vested
in
the
attorney
general,
he
can't
rid
himself
completely
by
saying
it's
all
that
down
congress
subordinate,
and
the
practical
considerations
don't
bother
me
very
much
because
in
the
generality
of
cases,
it
wouldn't
operate.
it
would
operate
so
as
to
allow
such
delegation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
without
statutory
authority,
he
can
close
the
door
and
in
case
something
--
as
to
which
the
congress
thought
he'd
named
the
attorney
general
to
do
something
that
he
can
roll
this
off
on
a
subordinate,
it
troubles
me
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
only
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
--
you've
--
all
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
i
have
no
trouble
about
congress
having
power
to
do
that,
none
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
--
you're
using
the
word,
“review”
in
a
rather
loose
sense.
meaning
by
that,
that
you
can
challenge
anybody
who
gives
him
authority
to
exercise
discretion
that
he
must
exercise
discretion
and
not
--
not
exercise
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
it
--
it
didn't
fail
to
exercise
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
review,
no
review
given
the
statute
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
much
be
before
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
go
back,
am
i
wrong
about
this,
i
think
they
go
back
about
the
time
that
enforcement
of
the
immigration
laws
or
transfer
of
the
department
of
labor
to
the
department
of
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
when
it
was
transferred.
