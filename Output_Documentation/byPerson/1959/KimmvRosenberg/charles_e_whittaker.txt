justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
mean
that
there
is
a
right
to
suspension
or
a
right
to
invoke
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
assuming
that
it
is
mr.
forer
--
assuming
that
it
is
wrong,
then
what
have
you
to
say
about
the
remaining
finding
that
he
is
asking
for
an
act
of
executive
grace
and
he,
himself,
must
show
eligibility.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
alright.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
very
well.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
wouldn't
the
statute
say
he
should
have
to
work?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
before
you
leave
that,
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
saying
that
the
regulation
151.3
(e)
is
invalid?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
wouldn't
it
seem
to
you
more
direct
to
ask
the
person?
he
is
most
likely
to
know
mainly
the
petitioner
who
is
asking
for
consideration?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
54
stat
what?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
thank
you.
