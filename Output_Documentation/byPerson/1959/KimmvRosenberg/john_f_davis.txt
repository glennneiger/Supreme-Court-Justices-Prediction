mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
it
is
of
prime
importance
in
this
case
to
understand
that
the
issue
of
mr.
kimm's
membership
or
not
in
a
communist
party
arose
not
in
connection
with
a
determination
as
to
his
deportability,
but
in
connection
with
his
application
for
suspension
of
deportation.
mr.
kimm
is
being
deported,
not
because
he
is
a
communist,
but
because
he
has
failed
to
maintain
his
status
as
a
student.
certainly,
when
he
came
to
this
country
in
1928
in
order
to
college,
no
one
contemplated
that
he
was
going
to
remain
a
student
for
32
years.
and
in
fact,
there
isn't
any
dispute
that
he
has
not
done
so.
his
own
evidence
as
introduced
in
the
case,
and
the
concessions
made
by
the
counsel
in
his
brief
and
in
this
court
indicate
that
he
has
not
been
enrolled
in
college
or
any
educational
institution
since
about
1938,
some
22
years
ago.
and
there
is
also
no
question
that
under
the
law,
his
failure
to
maintain
his
status
as
a
student
is
a
basis
for
deportation.
on
this
issue
his
membership
in
the
communist
party
is
immaterial.
and
in
fact,
his
failure
to
answer
has
no
significance.
but
congress
has
provided
in
order
to
ameliorate
the
hardship
cases
that
even
when
an
alien
is
clearly
deportable,
and
has
been
found
to
be
deportable,
still
as
a
matter
of
grace,
he
may
remain
in
the
country
so
long
as
he
fulfills
certain
specific
conditions.
and
one
of
these
conditions
is
that
he
not
have
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
in
which
because
this
is
one
of
the
conditions
that
the
hearing
examiner
asked
mr.
kimm
whether
or
not
he
was
a
member,
was
currently
a
member,
presently
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
mr.
kimm
refused
to
answer,
in
the
first
place,
claiming
the
first
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
we
--
we
shall
assume
--
i
shall
assume
during
the
remainder
of
the
argument
that
mr.
kimm
was
perfectly
within
his
rights
in
claiming
the
privilege
in
both
respects
that
no
one
could
have
directed
him
to
answer
and
that
no
implications
can
be
drawn
from
his
refusal
to
answer.
but
the
fact
that
he
was
privileged
to
remain
silent,
doesn't
answer
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
has
sufficiently
supported
his
application
for
suspension,
so
that
he
can
complain
because
of
its
denial.
i
think
the
situation
is
not
materially
different
than
he
saw
--
he'd
refused
to
answer
this
question
for
no
reason
at
all.
he
told
the
hearing
examiner
that
for
his
own
personal
reasons,
he
preferred
not
to
answer
the
question.
now
with
respect
to
these
suspension
proceedings,
this
court
has
twice
dealt
with
the
--
with
the
suspension
power
in
recent
years.
one
--
in
one
case
was
jay
against
boyd
--
boyd
in
351
united
states
and
the
second
case
was
hintopoulos
against
shaughnessy,
in
353
united
states.
that
in
both
these
cases,
the
court
recognized
that
the
suspension
of
deportation
is
a
--
is
a
grant
which
is
similar
to
suspension
of
a
criminal
sentence
of
a
grant
of
a
parole
of
--
or
grant
of
probation.
it's
a
--
it's
an
ameliorating
right
given
to
the
--
to
the
officer
who's
--
has
the
duty
to
--
in
particular
cases,
make
them
see
penalty
or
others
remedy,
less
harsh
than
as
otherwise
would
be.
judge
learned
hand
has
likened
it
to
the
president's
pardoning
power.
thus,
in
making
this
kind
on
application
to
the
attorney
general,
the
alien
is
in
effect,
throwing
himself
upon
the
mercy
of
the
attorney
general.
but
the
attorney
general
has
no
authority
to
grant
this
right
unless
the
alien
has
met
the
statutory
conditions.
one
of
those,
as
i
say,
is
that
he
not
be
a
member
or
not
have
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
now,
the
question,
first
question
is,
is
that
a
proper
condition
to
put
in
here?
well,
this
court
has
considered,
in
connection
with
deportation,
in
several
cases,
whether
or
not
membership
in
the
communist
party
is
a
proper
basis
for
deportation
itself
and
has
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
statutes
which
provide
for
deportation
in
the
case
of
past
membership
in
--
in
the
communist
party.
most
recent
of
these
cases
was
--
he
was
very
termed
and
new
at
the
case.
earlier,
they
passed
upon
it
the
question
galvan
against
--
you
passed
upon
it
in
galvan
against
the
press
and
counts
the
ideas
against
shaughnessy.
now,
if
it's
a
proper
basis
for
actually
determining
that
a
man
is
to
be
deported,
it
seems
that
it
would
follow
automatically,
that
it's
a
proper
basis
for
qualifying
for
special
relief.
as
we
see
the
situation,
this
condition
is
analogous
to
a
man
making
an
application
for
a
driver's
permit
and
being
asked
whether
or
not
he
has
good
eyesight.
now,
he
may
want
to
refuse
to
answer
but
he
has
good
eyesight
for
one
reason
or
another
and
perhaps
he,
perhaps
he
is
in
his
--
within
his
rights
to
refuse
to
say,
but
he
has
good
eyesight.
but
certainly,
he
is
in
no
position
to
complain
when
he
doesn't
get
a
driver's
permit
when
he
refuses
to
tell
the
--
the
people
who
were
testing
him
whether
he
has
good
eyesight.
or
a
lawyer
who
is
applying
for
admission
to
the
bar
might
well
be
asked
on
his
form,
whether
he
had
ever
been
disbarred
in
any
other
jurisdiction.
now,
presumably
the
lawyer
would
want
to
be
silent
on
this
question.
and
if
he
--
if
he
wished
to
be
silent
i'm
sure
no
one
would
force
him
to
--
to
answer,
but
he
is
not
then
on
a
position
to
complain
if
--
if
the
admitting
committee
refuses
to
consider
his
application.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
inclined
to
think
in
that
case
--
i
think
it
depends
somewhat
on
the
probation
system
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
whether
it
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
right
or
whether
it's
privileged,
but
i
think
in
most
cases
that
if
they
would
--
if
the
--
it
the
probation
officer
is
going
to
--
they
would
have
to
show,
if
they're
going
to
deny
it
on
that
basis,
they
would
have
to
have
some
record.
i
don't
think
his
failure
to
--
to
answer
could
be
taken
in
that
case
as
--
as
binding
from
--
from
the
example.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
would
depend
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
the
nature
of
the
procedure
which
you
set
up.
and
the
procedure
as
i
see
it,
this
man
really
has
a
right
to
have
his
consideration
for
probation
unless
he
is.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
--
and
then
it's
--
i
think
it's
a
different
situation
from
here.
well,
this
man
is
--
it's
more
like
the
pardoning
power
really
than
it
is
the
kind
of
probation
that
you're
thinking
of,
where
he's
throwing
himself
really
on
the
mercy
of
the
--
of
the
governor
entirely.
there
may
be
some
thought
that
this
is
different
because
this
question
deals
with
political
beliefs.
if
--
in
connection
with
the
--
with
the
communist
party.
but
i
submit
to
your
honors,
that
there
are
circumstances
where
it'd
be
entirely
proper
to
ask
a
man
whether
he
was
a
republican
or
a
democrat.
certainly,
if
a
man
was
nominated
for
a
position
for
a
commissionership
in
the
federal
power
commission
of
the
security
and
exchange
commission
where
the
law
requires
that
not
more
than
three
members
of
the
commission
based
from
anyone
party.
it's
entirely
appropriate,
indeed,
it's
necessary
to
inquire
of
this
man
or
find
out
in
someway
whether
or
not
the
man
is
a
republican
or
a
democrat.
this
isn't
because
it's
holding
it
against
the
man,
one
way
or
the
other,
but
it's
a
legal
--
it's
a
legal
requirement
for
the
job
and
the
only
way
to
find
out
is,
or
the
appropriate
way
to
find
out
is
to
ask
the
man.
now,
what
we
have
to
do
in
appraising
this
situation,
i
suppose,
is
to
fit
this
case
into
the
pattern
of
the
cases
which
have
been
before
this
court
in
the
last
few
years
with
respect
to
claims
of
privilege
against
incrimination
in
the
communist
--
in
connection
with
questions
on
the
communist
party.
these
cases
stretched
from
american
communications
associations
against
douds
to
the
decision
of
the
court
this
term
in
nelson
&
globe
against
los
angeles.
and
i
think
in
the
first
place,
we
ought
to
realize
that
this
is
not
a
loyalty
oaths
type
of
case.
this
isn't
a
kind
of
case
where
--
in
order
to
--
for
one
reason
or
another,
a
man
is
required
to
take
an
oath
that
he
--
that
he
does
believe
in
certain
things,
or
that
he
doesn't.
this
is
a
mere
question.
what
happens
after
the
question
is
answered
is
another
thing,
but
it's
not
a
--
it's
not
the
kind
of
loyalty
oath
that
you
find
in
--
well,
it
was
one
of
the
requirements
in
american
communications
commission
against
douds,
was
the
oath
rather
than
the
affidavit
end
of
it.
and
i
think
that
the
pfizer
against
randolph
case
is
also
the
kind
of
case
where
the
man
is
required
to
take
a
--
a
loyalty
oath
as
such.
now,
the
second
thing
we
must,
i
think
realize
is
that
this
is
not
in
itself
and
by
nature
a
direct
limitation
on
speech.
this
isn't
like
the
text
in
pfizer
against
randolph
where
the
very
purpose
of
the
text
was
to
restrict
the
man's
beliefs.
here
we
have
a
provision
and
an
immigration
law
which
says
that
this
privilege
shall
not
be
granted
if
the
man
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
the
question
is
asked
in
order
to
obtain
information
to
fit
within
that
statutory
framework,
so
that
if
there
is
the
limitation
on
--
on
speech,
it
goes
back
to
the
--
to
the
regulation
itself,
the
regulation
as
to
the
--
the
privilege
of
the
suspension
not
being
available
rather
than
to
the
asking
of
the
questions.
now,
in
the
third
place
i
want
to
point
out
that
here
the
question
is
very
specific.
it's
not
a
question
of
affiliation
with
organizations
that
sponsor
certain
concepts.
here,
there's
a
definite
question,
“were
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
so
that
there's
no
--
that's
not
the
breadth
for
ground
for
doubt
as
to
the
man
has
no
question.
he
can
--
he
can
answer
it
yes
or
no.
and
in
the
last
place
i
want
to
point
out
that
here
we
have
a
question
of
present
membership
rather
than
past
membership.
this
is
particularly
important
when
it
comes
to
questions
of
whether
he
is
sufficiently
proved
his
--
his
good
character.
when
--
when
we
have
cases
like
the
konigsberg
case
or
the
schware
case
which
deal
with
past
memberships,
which
may
--
may
have
been
--
been
as
long
ago
where
the
man
is
--
is
--
has
proved
his
present
good
character,
maybe
there
is
ground
to
--
to
--
which
this
court
has
held
there
is
--
or
suggested
there
is
ground
for
the
past
that
past
membership
by
itself
doesn't
--
isn't
enough
to
cast
a
shadow
of
the
man's
character.
but
i
doubt
very
much
that
those
cases
could
uphold
a
question
of
whether
question
of
present
membership
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
man's
character.
so,
i
think
when
--
when
we
put
this
case
into
the
framework
of
the
other
cases
decided
by
the
court,
this
really
falls
within
those
class
of
cases
where
the
court
has
upheld
the
right
of
employing
states
to
ask
question
of
their
employees
in
order
to
find
out
whether
they
are
fitted
to
hold
their
jobs,
but
they're
--
they
are
--
except
--
except
i
may
say
that
this
i
think
is
a
stronger
case
because
in
those
cases,
a
man's
job
will
be
taken
away
from
him
if
he
refuses
to
answer.
and
this
is
may
be
closer
to
the
case
where
a
man
is
applying
for
a
position
and
where
in
connection
with
his
application
for
a
job,
he
is
asked
whether
or
not
he
is
a
member
of
the
--
of
the
communist
party.
certainly,
i
think
in
that
case,
the
court
would
hold
that
this
is
in
inquiry
which
is
within
the
scope
of
the
authority
of
the
employing
agency
and
that
the
man
should
be
required
to
answer.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
this
--
this
case
comes
specifically
under
the
1940
act,
the
alien
--
that's
where
the
suspension
provision
comes
in.
section
37
(a)
of
the
alien
registration
act
says,
“the
powers
conferred
upon
the
attorney
general
by
this
act
--
this
is
one
of
the
powers,
upon
the
attorney
general
by
this
act
and
all
other
powers
of
the
attorney
general
relating
to
the
administration
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
maybe
exercised
by
the
attorney
general
through
such
officers
of
the
department
of
justice
including
officers
in
the
immigration
and
naturalization
and
service
as
he
may
designate
specifically
to
such
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
is
section
37
(a)
of
the
alien
registration
act
of
1905,
that's
--
was
codified
--
was
50
--
54
stat.
670
and
it
used
to
be
codified
as
8
u.s.c.
451.
mr.
john
f.
davis
54
stat.
670.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
a
similar
provision
in
the
law
to
date.
since
then
we
have
the
1952
act
and
the
1952
act
in
section
103,
that's
codified
because
the
present
code
has
a
similar
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
jay
against
boyd?
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
the
--
well,
what
was
referred
to
specifically
against
--
in
jay
against
boyd
was
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
authority
of
the
regulation
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
which
--
which
delegated
the
authority.
i
--
i
can't
remember
of
the
time
when
jay
against
boyd,
so
i
can't
remember
what
the
authority
to
make
the
delegation
was.
mr.
john
f.
davis
1956,
it
must
have
been
the
1952
act.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
then
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
in
these
cases
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
yes,
i
understand
that
design.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
yes.
of
course,
it
arises
--
they
don't
lay
down
a
rule
of
law
as
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
like
a
regulation
or
like
a
legislature,
they
decide
in
particular
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
the
way
we
understand
it.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
this
--
i
may
say
probably
this
is
necessary,
too.
this
--
in
the
--
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
question
was
asked
the
counsel
as
to
the
volume
of
cases
where
there
was
suspension
and
what
--
and
what
congress
had
done
with
them
and
in
--
after
the
argument,
a
letter
of
march
29
was
addressed
to
the
clerk
at
this
court
from
the
solicitor
general
describing
the
--
the
nature,
how
many
of
these
cases
there
were.
and
we
find
that
there
were
--
in
this
period
which
was
covered
--
it's
a
five-year
period
from
1954
to
1959,
there
were
6665
cases
that
were
--
which
were
covered.
and
it's
apparent
that
the
attorney
general
this
time
passed
upon
these
cases
automatically
that
has
to
be
some
weeding
out.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
they've
three
ways
that
they
can
get
to
the
attorney
general.
he
can
do
it
informally
and
they
often
do,
i'm
sure.
but
it
goes
from
the
board
of
--
and
this
has
always
been
so
since
the
board
of
immigration
feels
has
been
setup
i
think,
mr.
justice
clark.
the
three
ways
that
it
can
go
from
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
to
the
attorney
general,
one
is,
if
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
refers
it.
two
is
that
the
commission
of
immigration
asked
that
it
be
--
he
--
he's
dissatisfied
with
the
rule
of
law
that's
the
board
of
immigration,
or
three,
if
the
attorney
general,
himself,
becomes
interested
in
the
case.
now,
i
suggest
that
--
and
he
asked
for
it.
i
suggest
that
it's
quite
proper
and
it
must
happen.
i
can't
give
you
statistics
on
it.
that
counsel
for
immigrants
who
are
dissatisfied
would
write
a
letter
to
the
attorney
general
saying,
“the
board
of
immigration
appeals
has
made
this
determination
and
we
ask
you
to
look
at
this
and
see
if
you
don't
want
to
review
it.”
and
then
he
can
or
cannot
review
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
but
as
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
say
that
the
statute,
that
congress
itself
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
would
make
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
no
it's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it's
not
final,
because
he
has
setup
a
procedure
for
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
the
statute
--
that's
--
you're
quite
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
statute
doesn't
--
wouldn't
require
any
appeals
at
all
i
think.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
he
couldn't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
far
as
the
language
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
no
it's
not.
it's
not
binding
without
review
because
there
is
a
review
in
the
courts
with
--
with
respect
to
--
to
the
fact.
mr.
john
f.
davis
under
the
interpretations
of
the
statute
by
this
court.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
mean
a
review
of
the
decisions
by
the
attorney
general
on
his
designee
reviewed
by
the
courts.
there
is
a
limited
review
of
the
exercises
of
this
discretion
by
the
courts.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
no,
because
the
--
the
regulations
don't
provide
for
court
review,
that's
done
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
under
habeas
corpus
or
--
under
the
--
under
the
administrative
procedure.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
was
jay
against
boyd
or
not,
but
there
has
been
a
review
of
the
action
suspension
in
this
court
in
--
in
quite
a
few
cases
and
to
this
court
comes
to
jay
against
boyd
and
hintopoulos
against
shaughnessy,
and
the
accardi
case,
was
another
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
he
couldn't
exercise
the
discretion
--
discretion
for
an
improper
purpose
that's
--
that
was
mentioned.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
that
is
right.
but
as
far
as
the
statute
goes
there's
no
--
there's
no
specification.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
--
not
the
kind
of
according
to
the
terms
of
the
fact.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes.
well,
i
--
as
far
as
the
regulations
go,
the
--
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
attorney
general
has
made
careful
provisions,
i
don't
mean
present
attorney
general.
the
--
the
attorney
generals
have
made
specific
provisions
to
protect
these
rights
and
to
have
a
review
not
by
people
in
the
ordinary
work
of
the
immigration
service
but
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
which
is
independent,
so
to
speak
of
the
--
of
the
services.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
don't
really
remember,
it
goes
back
along
way
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it
goes
back,
i
think
--
i
think
you're
right
mr.
justice.
