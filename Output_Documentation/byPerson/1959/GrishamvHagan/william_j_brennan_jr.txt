what
we're
talking
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happens
to
the
foreign
nationals
employed
by
our
military
who
may
commit
an
offense
against
the
--
our
military
code
but
which
is
not
an
offense
against
the
laws
of
that
nation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
take
narcotics?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
a
nation
where
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
don't
have
such
treaties.
what
--
what
is
it
that
brings
them
outside
the
land
of
naval
forces
if
their
american
counterpart
civilians
are
within
our
land
of
naval
forces?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
that
was
assuming
in
the
event
of
capture
by
an
enemy
so
that
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
enjoy
the
status
of
one
of
that
right
in
as
a
prisoner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
just
wonder,
do
we
still
have
assimilated
ranks
in
these
days
where
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
maybe
but
do
they
have
assimilated
rank?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
perhaps
i
have
forgotten
maybe
it's
too
long
back
but
my
recollection
of
assimilated
ranks
was
assimilated
rank,
but
civilian
had
assimilated
right
of
the
colonel
or
lieutenant
colonel
(inaudible)
as
we
look
at
it.
