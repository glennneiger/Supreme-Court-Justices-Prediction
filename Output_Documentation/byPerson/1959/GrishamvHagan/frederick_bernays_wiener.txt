mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
if
the
court
please,
mr.
kalp
has
asked
me
to
reply
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
and
i
have
entered
my
appearance
(inaudible).
does
your
honor
propose
to
adjourn
promptly
at
4:30
because
i
will
have
to
do
modified
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
very
well.
i
agree
with
mr.
davis
that
history
is
very
important
in
this
connection,
but,
it's
got
to
be
history
in
the
words
of
the
old
german
professor
(inaudible)
as
it
actually
was
not
some
imaginary
picture
that
we
reconstruct
like
--
now,
mr.
davis
has
built
his
argument
where
no
form
of
civil
judicature
is
enforced
on
what
he
calls
the
statute
of
the
british
parliament
in
1765.
that's
the
1765
articles
of
war
which
began
at
page
91
of
winthrop's
reprint.
that
wasn't
the
statute.
those
were
the
prerogative
articles
of
war.
those
where
the
prerogative
articles
of
war
made
by
the
kings
and
it
wasn't
until
1803
for
some
periods
and
1813
for
all
time
that
parliament
undertook
to
limit
the
king's
power
to
make
prerogative
articles
outside
the
realm.
so,
this
is
a
simply
a
royal
regulation.
that
is
the
origin
of
it,
not
an
act
of
parliament.
and
then,
we
get
to
the
omitted
paragraph
from
mr.
samuel
and
there
is
nothing
there
about
our
form
of
judicature.
he
says
so
forth
at
home
or
in
similar
establishments
which
are
of
a
permanent
and
domestic
nature
abroad
where
the
ordinary
laws
have
their
force
and
are
administered
through
the
medium
of
the
civil
courts,
there
is
not
a
word
in
there
about
our
form
of
judicature,
not
a
word.
so
that,
what
is
this
historical
basis
--
this
involves
employees
generally,
i
don't
think
there
has
been
a
--
a
great
distinction
shown
between
this
case
and
covert
if
the
capital
distinction
or
capital
--
non-capital
means
anything
because
it's
the
same
status,
the
distinction
isn't
there
in
two
and
a
half
years
ago
we
couldn't
point.
what
is
the
history
of
subjecting
civilian
dependents
to
trial
by
court-martial
in
time
of
peace?
time
of
war,
there
is
no
question.
we
go
back
to
the
1790s.
i
did
not
say
if
the
court
please
that
the
1790s
were
a
time
of
war
because
they've
tried
civilians,
no.
i
--
i
thought
it
was
a
time
of
peace
when
i
originally
wrote
my
brief
and
they
are
long
because
i
gathered
all
the
materials.
what
i
said
was
this.
the
commanding
general
could
order
a
death
sentence
into
execution
only
in
time
of
war.
he
couldn't
do
it
in
time
of
peace,
in
time
of
peace
until
1796,
he
had
to
refer
to
the
secretary
for
transmission
to
congress
and
yet
wayne
executed
in
numerous
death
sentence
as
they
also
executed
dismissal
sentences
and
i
started
researching
what
did
this
was
"mad"
anthony
wayne,
that
mad?
and
the
only
way
those
executions
and
some
of
them
took
place
at
pittsburgh
in
1792.
the
only
way
those
could've
been
legal
would've
been
in
time
of
war.
and
then
i
saw
that
excerpt
in
the
orderly
book
at
west
point
where
mr.
pickering
says,
this
excludes
the
notion
of
its
being
at
time
of
peace
and
the
like
don't
--
they
thought,
not
we
think,
not
your
honors
has
held
(i
v.
mary,
but
they
thought
that
it
was
the
time
of
war
because
otherwise,
those
executions
for
desertion
in
time
of
peace
without
reference
to
congress
would've
been
acts
of
murder.
and
they
thought
they
were
legal
and
secretary
knox
was
to
stick
where
a
man
who
went
by
the
book.
he
thought
they
were
legal.
so,
they
thought
that
was
time
of
war.
alright,
so,
what
have
we
left
for
this
solid
basis
of
history
which
says
that
civilian
employees
can
be
tried
by
court-martial
in
time
of
peace?
well,
following
the
peace
of
greenville
which
i
agree
marks
the
end
of
what
they
thought
was
time
of
war,
there
are
about
10
cases
in
the
1790s
from
1796
to
1798
about
10
cases
of
civilians
tried
by
court-martial
about
half
of
whom
haven't
any
connection
with
the
armed-services,
just
citizens
of
detroit,
a
citizen
of
--
of
mississippi
territory
(inaudible)
and
some
of
these
trials
take
place
in
a
place
where
there
is
a
form
of
our
civil
judicature
in
force
namely
in
pittsburgh,
in
detroit.
10
cases
of
which
five
don't
have
any
connection
and
number
of
the
others,
they
were
civil
courts.
then,
in
between
1825
and
1858,
there
are
seven
trials,
five
of
which
took
place
where
there
were
civil
courts
and
then
one
of
them,
the
ringsmer
case,
something
was
made
at
the
court-martial
proceedings
saying,
let's
adjourn
this
and
have
it
tried
by
the
district
court
of
green
county
in
territory
of
utah
which
is
within
reach.
and
they
went
ahead
so
that
in
five
of
those
seven
cases
between
1825
and
1858,
the
civil
judicature
was
present.
one
of
the
others
was
a
trial
by
regimental
court-martial
out
in
the
indian
territory
and
then
the
other
one,
the
court
get
so
discussed
that
they
said
where
this
man
is
settler's
clerk,
he's
got
nothing
to
do
with
this,
we
won't
proceed
further
in
the
prosecution.
so
that,
what
does
this
solid
basis
of
history
evaporate
into?
episodic
instances,
many
of
them
flagrantly
illegal
and
most
of
them
beyond
the
bounds
that
the
government
now
claims
for.
now,
again,
here
is
the
problem
of
history.
mr.
davis
of
course
wouldn't
cite
an
overrule
case
to
your
honors,
but
he
is
relying
here
on
an
overruled
opinion
of
the
judge
advocate
general
because
that
opinion
of
general
holt
in
--
in
1866
just
a
few
weeks
before
the
milligan
case
came
out
which
was
in
the
1868
digestive
opinions
was
dropped
like
a
very
hot
potato
from
the
1880
edition
which
in
lieu
thereof
inserted
these
digested
--
these
opinions
in
1877
and
the
post
traitor
ruling
that
we've
said
forth
here.
well,
now,
where
you
have
--
and
in
1877,
the
judge
advocate
general
said,
this
has
been
the
consistent
view
of
the
bureau.
now,
i
don't
think
that
the
totality
--
i
mean,
i'm
not
trying
to
argued
by
--
i'm
trying
to
look
through
this
mass
of
historical
materials
to
come
up
with
the
--
with
the
correct
answer.
this
doesn't
establish
a
solid
basis
of
history
because
the
first
time
that
they
came
to
consider
it
was
in
1877,
attorney
general
taft
that
not
to
open
opinion
and
the
judge
advocate
general
wanted
it
reconsidered.
and
it
was
reconsidered
and
it
was
reconsidered
by
attorney
general
devons
who
had
been
a
division
commander
in
the
civil
war
and
he
laid
down
what
was
the
touchtone
of
--
of
the
boundaries
of
military
jurisdiction
from
1877
certainly
through
the
1912
digest.
then,
in
1916,
there
wasn't
any
constitutional
articulation.
i've
had
that
--
read
that
testimony
of
general
crowder's
many
times.
he
--
he
wanted
to
catch
receiving
clerk
whose
name
mr.
justice
frankfurter
does
not
appear
in
the
--
in
the
hearings
just
simply
the
fact
that
there
was
such
a
case.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
so,
that
you
don't
any
--
i
mean,
when
--
when
you
get
away
from
the
flagrant
illegalities
of
anthony
wayne,
establishing
a
military
opa
in
western
pennsylvania
in
1792,
when
he
get
away
from
wilkinson
taking
a
citizen
out
of
detroit
because
his
counsel
advised
the
soldier
to
desert
and
tried
in
by
court-martials
for
a
violation
of
a
military
order
when
the
magistrates
were
present,
remove
those
illegal
instances
and
--
and
you
have
simply
a
few
unconnected
episodes.
you
have
a
history
which
is
a
record
of
--
of
abuses,
of
overreaching
but
you
don't
have
a
settled
administrative
practice
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
none
of
these
instances
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
higher
civil
authority.
and
then,
for
a
minute,
the
alternatives,
we
thought
we
were
dealing
with
the
military
dependents,
perhaps
mrs.
dial
in
the
singleton
case.
and
civilian
employees
and
now
we
are
told
that
it
includes
also
contractor's
employee
and
the
dependents
of
the
civilian
employees
and
the
dependents
of
the
contractor's
employees.
in
other
words,
anyone
who
was
--
who
was
livelihood
is
somehow
dependent
ultimately
on
the
military
or
the
department
of
defense
appropriation
bill
is
subject
to
court-martial
jurisdiction.
we
have
a
case
in
the
singleton
brief,
mrs.
heath.
she
was
the
wife
of
a
--
of
a
contractor's
employee
on
(inaudible),
she
was
charged
with
premeditated
murder
though
she
got
a
habeas
corpus
and
was
turned
over
to
the
civil
administration
of
the
ryuko
island
where
she
should've
been
tried
in
the
first
place.
of
course,
there
are
alternatives.
there
are
alternatives
in
all
of
these
instances
and
the
obvious
alternative
where
you
have
the
kind
of
offenses
involved
here
is
in
the
local
courts.
and,
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
indicated,
how
can
you
make
jurisdiction,
the
power
of
the
tribunal
to
act
in
the
premises,
how
can
you
make
that
depend
on
the
length
of
the
person's
stay?
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
very
amusing
--
that
it's
to
me,
it's
amusing
--
colloquy
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
code
where
somebody
asked,
what
about
the
--
the
--
when
they've
--
they
have
no
constitutional
doubts
about
211,
what
about
the
criminal
amenability
to
the
code
of
a
visiting
mother-in-law?
and,
the
discussion
indicates
well
if
she
stays
a
long
time,
well
then,
she's
subject
to
it,
but
if
she's
only
there
for
a
short
visit,
that's
alright.
well,
there
is
certainly
is
a
wonderful
way
of
dealing
with
the
mother-in-law
problem
because
you
said
on
that
hate
to
see
you
go
but
if
you
stay
any
longer,
you
might
be
subject
to
trial
by
court-martial.[laughter]
now,
not
to
close
on
that
kind
of
note
in
the
matter
that's
intensely
serious,
let
me
go
back
to
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
just
briefly.
three
times
in
the
last
few
years,
this
court
has
said
in
its
opinions,
we
do
not
write
upon
a
clean
slate.
now,
between
--
between
1787,
when
the
constitution
was
submitted
for
application,
over
180
years
to
1957,
when
the
government
filed
its
briefs
in
the
covert
rehearing
--
when
officers
phrase
nobody
but
nobody
but
nobody
ever
suggested
that
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
could
be
drawn
off
to
enlarge
the
scope
of
land
and
naval
forces
in
clause
14.
it
is
significant
in
this
connection
that
the
exception
in
the
fifth
amendment
except
for
cases
arising
in
the
land
and
naval
--
or
naval
forces
and
in
earlier
drafts
which
i
think
make
its
meaning
more
plain
except
in
cases
arising
in
the
government
of
the
land
and
or
naval
forces.
there
is
no
suggestion
except
in
cases
arising
in
the
land
or
in
naval
forces
or
among
such
per
number
accompanying
civilians
entitled
to
these
whom
the
government
might
prefer
to
try
by
court-martial
or
something
like
that.
i
mean,
that
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
suggestion.
to
me
that
the
--
the
strongest
argument
against
the
--
against
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
argument
is
the
fact
that
for
180
years,
no,
it
never
occurred
to
anyone.
we
don't
write
on
a
clean
slate.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
think
before
the
bill
of
rights
was
adopted,
there
would
be
more
ground
for
saying
that
we
construe
the
clause
14
with
clause
18,
with
article
iii
section
2
even
though
hamilton
and
number
83
of
the
federalist
issue
(inaudible)
that
the
thing
--
or
that
it
remained
invalid.
but
when
the
amendments
were
then
adopted,
it
was
doubled
--
it
was
voted
down
doubly,
it's
the
only
double
guarantee
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no.
i
would
say
there
would
be
a
room
for
argument.
i
don't
think
it
had
any
scope
but
when
--
when
the
amend
--
when
the
bill
of
rights
was
adopted
with
the
double
guarantee
of
jury
trial,
the
only
double
guarantee
in
--
in
the
constitution,
then
it
was
like
the
general
forrest
to
tell
the
lieutenant,
no,
i
told
you
twice.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
think
land
and
naval
forces,
if
we're
dealing
with
that,
if
we're
dealing
with
the
history,
i
don't
think
land
and
naval
forces
had
any
context
beyond
the
persons
with
a
military
status.
there
has
been
too
much
--
decided
and
too
much
said
about
what
a
military
status
is
and
what
it's
consequences
are
and
how
it
is
obtained
for
me
to
believe
that
that
is
susceptible
of
--
of
widening.
now,
one
of
the
points
i
think
that
--
that
in
the
--
in
the
course
of
studies
on
this
--
in
this
subject
than
in
the
looking
into
the
military
law,
it
was
1790s.
i
think
i've
--
i've
--
on
the
basis
of
the
materials,
i've
changed
my
evaluation
of
the
material
--
in
two
respects.
first,
when
i
started
the
covert
proceeding
by
petition
in
the
district
court,
i
thought
that
there
might
be
a
distinction
between
employees
and
dependents.
i
began
convinced
on
the
course
of
that
litigation
and
the
government
then
didn't
disagree
that
it
is
only
a
difference
of
degree
and
not
a
difference
of
time,
that
it
was
a
question
of
states.
other
point,
what
about
the
undoubted
wartime
jurisdiction
in
the
field?
my
view
as
to
the
scope
of
that
haven't
changed
because
it's
so
clearly
and
specifically
expressly
set
forth.
i
do
feel
however
that
that
jurisdiction
rests
not
on
clause
14
but
on
the
war
power
because
otherwise,
there
wouldn't
be
any
basis
for
bringing
all
these
civilians
into
the(inaudible)
of
military
tribunals.
and
closing
with
what
i
suppose
is
one
of
the
central
constitutional
questions,
are
we
to
expand
clause
14?
let
us
go
back
to
the
original
exposition,
john
marshall,
the
great
chief
justice.
that
the
end
would
be
legitimate
whether
it
would
be
within
the
scope
of
the
constitution
and
all
means
which
are
appropriate,
which
are
plainly
adopted
to
that
end
which
are
not
prohibited
but
consist
with
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
constitution
are
constitutional.
i
think
that
to
try
civilians
by
court-martial
in
time
of
peace
is
not
a
legitimate
end.
it's
not
within
the
scope
of
the
constitution,
it's
twice
prohibited
by
the
constitution
and
it's
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
and
with
the
spirit
of
our
institutions.
