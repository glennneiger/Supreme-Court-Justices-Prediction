mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
beginning
the
burden
of
my
argument,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
a
number
of
district
problems
that
come
up
in
which
some
of
the
justices
have
asked
questions
or
perhaps
we
have
not
given
full
response.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
court
of
military
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction
of
grisham
in
september
1954,
september
1954
and
the
sentence
was
ordered
into
execution
on
october
15th,
1954.
on
the
subject
of
legislation
since
the
covert
case,
we
are
informed
that
legislation
was
drafted
with
respect
to
capital
offenses
by
dependents,
but
that
it
was
decided
as
speculated
by
mr.
justice
clark
that
it
was
better
to
await
the
decision
of
the
court
in
these
cases
to
say
exactly
what
the
problems
of
legislation
would
be
so
that
the
matter
could
be
treated
as
in
one
package
rather
than
in
piecemeal.
the
third
matter
on
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
it
was
not
proposed
into
congress.
it
was
drafted
within
the
executive
department.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
capital
crimes
by
dependants,
the
precise
situation
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right,
nothing
more.
because
as
i
was
saying
yesterday,
it
was
not
--
there
was
a
constitutional
adjudication
to
which
the
executive
has
to
bow.
it
was
not
thought
that
the
--
any
of
the
suggested
alternatives
were
either
feasible
or
acceptable
and
so,
if
i
may
put
it
this
way
until
further
constitutional
adjudications
compel
the
executive
to
go
further,
it
was
not
thought
that
it
ought
--
it
ought
to
do
so.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
we
--
as
we
--
we
accept
the
--
the
decision
in
the
covert
case.
we
have
not
asked
for
it
to
be
overruled
and
that
--
that
hiatus
still
exists.
on
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it
is
primarily
out
of
the
pentagon,
but
if
there
cannot
be
military
trial
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
then
--
then
the
department
of
justice
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that
is
right,
sir.
the
third
separate
matter
is
on
the
common
law
types
of
crimes
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
is
true
that
it
wasn't
until
1863
that
some
of
them
were
mentioned
eo
nomine
in
the
--
in
the
articles
of
war,
but
for
a
long
time
before
that,
there
was
the
general
article
of
war
which
provided
for
the
punishment
of
offenses
prejudicial
to
good
order
and
military
discipline
and
specifically
including
the
phrase,
“non-capital
offenses.”
and
as
this
court
held
in
the
mason
case
which
colonel
wiener
mentioned,
any
common
law
type
of
crime
that
could
be
attached
to
--
to
the
military
to
show
that
it
--
it
did
cause
discredit
or
prejudice
to
military
order
could
be
tried
by
courts-martial
under
that
article
of
war.
and
so
that,
as
an
actual
matter
of
the
fact,
common
law
types
of
crimes,
homicides,
larcenies,
burglaries
were
tried
by
courts-martial
even
in
times
of
peace.
it
wasn't
until
1863
that
these
common
law
types
of
crime
were
mentioned
by
name
in
the
statutes
and
in
fact,
i
think
as
was
said,
not
until
1916
that
the
other
types
were
mentioned
the
--
the
lesser
offenses.
on
the
matter
of
type
of
employment
also
mr.
justice
stewart,
grisham
was
an
auditor
but
he
was
a
cost
accountant
for
a
military
line
of
communications
between
france
and
germany
which
was
necessary
not
for
the
general
civilian
population
but
for
our
occupation
troops
there.
and
he
was
doing
a
cost
accounting
type
of
work
but
i'm
sure
that
they
were
enlisted
and
commissioned
personnel
that
were
also
engaged
in
doing.
and
colonel
wiener
says
that
--
that
this
type
of
activity
should
be
all
in
covered
under
a
kind
of
civilian
draft.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that,
though
he
was
a
cost
accountant
and
an
auditor,
he
was
dealing
with
a
very
directly
military
function
in
germany.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
civilian
gardener
working
for
the
military?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
--
but
since
counsel
made
the
distinction
that
that
--
his
man
was
not
engaged
and
what
he
thought
was
a
military
function,
i
want
to
meet
him
on
his
own
ground
and
say
that
this
man
was
engaged
in
military
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
stationed
overseas.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
that
is
our
position
as
in
the
--
in
the
singleton
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
civilian
dependents
are
on
the
same
category
in
our
view
as
dependents
of
military
personnel.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right
and
the
last
separate
matter
that
i
have
to
take
up
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
housing.
there
are
separate
--
there
are
certain
bases,
individual
housing.
frequently
they
aren't
enough.
for
instance,
if
i
may
go
back
to
the
guagliardo
case,
the
first
case,
i
was
informed
that
at
nouasseur
air
base
in
morocco
which
is
the
base
involved
there,
there
was
a
trailer
camp,
there
were
99
prefabricated
houses
and
there
were
some
other
kinds.
they
weren't
enough.
civilian
personnel
are
--
are
eligible
for
this
as
well
as
service
personnel.
per
contrary,
i
think
this
is
important
because
it's
the
issue
is
--
the
matter
is
really
been
--
been
--
shall
i
say,
“overshadowed.”
it
is
very
frequent
for
service
personnel
to
live
off
the
base
both
in
this
country
and
abroad.
so,
the
fact
that
grisham
here
or
guagliardo
in
the
first
case,
lived
off
the
base
and
got
a
quarters
allowance
didn't
really
separate
them
from
the
--
from
the
service
anymore
than
--
than
a
corporal
or
sergeant
or
a
lieutenant
who
lives
in
the
town
nearby
and
gets
his
quarters
--
quarters
allowance.
that's
a
very
common
incident
of
military
relationship
both
in
this
country
and
abroad.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
can't
really
say.
i
think,
as
to
the
housing
which
is
technically
on
the
base,
i
think
the
base
commander
has
the
right
to
--
to
make
rules
if
i
can
draw
on
my
own
experience
from
world
war
ii,
in
some
places,
he
didn't
make
rules
and
other
places,
he
didn't
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
the
dependent,
about
450,000.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
thousand.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
civilians?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
about
25
--
25,000.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
--
i
can't
give
you
the
figures
of
this
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
would
be
more
--
no.
the
--
the
25,000
includes
direct
employees
of
the
government,
such
as
we
have
in
these
three
cases.
it
includes
some
--
some
employees
are
contractors,
not
a
great
number
i
think.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
one
state
removed.
but
there
are
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
oh,
yes.
they
are
serving
with
the
army
under
the
--
under
the
historical
definition.
these
cases
were
involved
but
we
would
certainly
make
the
same
argument.
there
are
only
a
few
thousand
of
those
and
the
third
category
is
--
certain
civilians
at
naval
--
naval
reservations
which
were
also
a
small
amount.
i
think
the
bulk
of
the
25,000
are
americans
who
are
civil
service
employees
of
the
united
states
that
you
see.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
i
would
say
--
you
can
fairly
say
that
the
bulk
of
them
are
direct
employees
of
the
armed
forces?
that
is
the
army
or
the
air
force
or
the
navy.
the
bulk
of
--
but
in
our
view,
they
would
not
be
exclusively
that.
there
are
some
others.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
certain
employees,
yes.
we
think
employees
of
contractors
are
included.
the
25,000
figure
which
i
gave
includes
i
think
just
a
couple
of
thousands
of
those
employees
because
there
are
different
kinds.
there
are
technical
representatives
and
there
are
other
kinds.
technical
representatives
are
people
working
on
important
electronic
equipment
at
bases
and
they
are
included
in
the
figure
of
25,000
and
26,000.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
our
view,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
for
a
temporary
stay,
i
don't
want
to
give
a
categorical
answer
because
the
question
would
be
whether
he
would
be
serving
with
the
armed
forces
during
that
period,
he
would
certainly
not
be
employed.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
it
were
a
long
enough
period
he
would
be
serving.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
we
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
difference
as
far
as
the
constitutional
power
between
the
direct
employee
of
the
government
or
the
employee
of
the
contractor.
we
think
that
they
are
all
included.
it
so
happens
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right,
the
nature
of
the
employment.
it
so
happens
that
in
these
three
cases,
there's
a
direct
civil
service
employee
of
the
government
involved.
we
do
not
think
that
these
distinctions
which
i
have
been
discussing
are
dispositive.
i
mentioned
them
because
i've
been
asked
the
questions.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
i
think
a
distinction
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
constitutional
distinction,
if
i
may
summarize
it
first,
it
maybe
the
whole
burden
of
my
argument,
mr.
justice
black.
the
constitution
--
the
constitutional
basis
is
that
we
think
that
as
we
stand
today
in
1959,
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
employees,
people
serving
with
the
army
is
proper
to
use
the
old
words
of
the
statute
of
1765
to
which
i
referred
yesterday
and
to
which
i
returned
where
our
form
of
civil
judicature
is
not
in
force,
that
is
where
--
where
the
american
courts
do
not
exist.
in
the
continental
united
states,
our
form
of
civil
judicature
does
exist.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
--
i'm
referring
to
an
--
the
british
statute
of
1765
as
a
--
as
a
general
thread
which
runs
throughout
i
think
all
these
historical
materials
that
--
that
the
historical
materials
turn
in
very
large
part
on
the
fact
whether
the
civil
jurisdiction
of
the
country,
our
country
as
far
as
we're
concern
in
great
britain,
as
far
as
its
concern
exists
in
the
outlying
area.
if
it
does
not
exist,
then,
i
think
that
--
that
the
court
--
the
material
show
uniformly
that
--
that
court-martial
jurisdiction
was
thought
to
be
valid
and
proper.
now,
i
don't
have
to
argue,
mr.
justice
black,
that
employees
in
the
united
states
should
be
covered
on
court.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
have
to
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
if
--
if
i
may
appeal
to
what
the
court
is
frequently
appealed
to,
those
are
different
problems
and
there
were
different
historical
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
we
think
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
--
the
dispositive
fact
as
far
as
jurisdiction
is,
is
that
there
is
no
form
of
our
civil
judicature
existing
in
this
foreign
lands.
and
if
i
may,
i
would
--
i
think
i
would
be
able
to
try
to
show
that
this
is
the
thread
of
the
history
to
go
back
where
--
where
i
was
yesterday
at
the
--
at
the
beginning,
i
--
i
summarized
four
general
propositions
which,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
summarize
again
and
then
go
on
try
to
show
the
court
that
these
propositions
are
historically
accurate.
and
the
first
is
that
there
has
been
a
consistent
thread
since
the
middle
of
the
18th
century
for
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
employees
and
dependents
throughout
our
history
and
for
the
british
history
before.
and
that
this
is
exhibited
in
the
great
deal
of
legislation
and
in
a
great
deal
of
practice.
and
the
second
point
is,
that
the
hostility
to
which
colonel
wiener
and
the
other
attorneys
on
the
--
on
the
other
side
have
referred
throughout
the
18th
century
and
thereafter
was
not
hostility
to
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
service
connected
personnel,
but
hostility
to
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
inhabitants
generally.
the
two
important
historical
materials
which
colonel
wiener
mentioned
today
both
belong
to
that
category.
the
statute
of
1765
which
he
referred
to
about
taking
people
who
commit
offenses
in
forts
and
garrisons
to
the
nearest
civil
magistrate,
that
covers
--
inhabitants
generally
who
committed
crimes
within
the
bounds
of
a
fort
or
garrison.
it
doesn't
cover
service
connected
personnel.
it
specifically
says,
“people
who
are
not
subject
to
court-martial.”
it's
inhabitants
generally
and
similarly,
it
was
pointed
out
from
the
bench,
the
northwest
ordinance
referred
to
inhabitants
generally
and
not
the
service
connected
personnel.
and
that
brings
me
to
my
--
my
third
point
which
i
repeat
again
because
i
think
nothing
has
been
brought
for
to
disapprove
what
i
said.
and
that
is
that
there
are
no
affirmative
rulings,
no
affirmative
statements
in
the
18th
century
before
the
constitution
was
adopted
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
or
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution.
and
i
don't
limit
this
merely
to
the
debates
on
the
adoption
of
the
constitution.
i
sweep
in
the
whole
history.
there
are
no
affirmative
rulings
or
statements
at
that
time
opposing
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
service
connected
personnel.
all
the
statements
as
far
as
we've
been
able
to
find
are
statements
opposing
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
inhabitants
generally.
and
so,
we
think
that
--
that
the
type
of
jurisdiction
for
which
we
argue
here
does
find
support
in
the
history
and
there
are
no
opposing
materials.
and
then,
the
fourth
general
point
which
i'll
also
try
to
show
is
that
this
type
of
jurisdiction
wasn't
limited
to
war
or
actual
hostilities.
it
--
it
stood
on
two
factors,
the
connection
of
the
person
with
the
military
and
the
need
for
the
exercise
of
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
it.
and
in
the
latter
factor,
the
need
for
the
exercise
of
court-martial
jurisdiction,
the
absence
of
civil
judicature,
a
phrase
which
i
would
like
to
repeat
because
i
think
it's
the
foundation
of
--
of
the
history
of
this
case,
of
this
matter,
that's
the
most
important
factor
throughout
the
history.
now,
to
go
--
i
won't
detail
for
the
court
because
they
are
included
both
in
our
briefs
and
in
the
briefs
of
the
other
side
the
various
british
and
american
statutes
providing
for
court-martial
jurisdiction
in
the
18th
century
over
civilian
persons.
they
covered
settlers,
returners
to
a
camp
or
persons
whatsoever
serving
with
our
armies
in
the
field
though
not
enlisted
soldiers.
there
are
a
large
numbers
of
british
statutes,
there
are
american
articles
of
war
both
adopted
by
the
colonies
and
by
the
continental
congress.
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
--
that
these
persons
were
reviewed
--
viewed
as
civilian
employees.
the
continental
congress
refers
to
them
in
the
civil
department
of
the
army.
they
were
wagoners.
there
were
some
artillery
men,
there
were
forge
masters,
there
were
quarter
masters,
commissaries,
pay
masters.
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief
both
in
the
original
brief
--
in
the
opening
brief
in
21
where
the
main
argument
was
made
in
the
guagliardo
case
and
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
existed
before
war,
mr.
justice
stewart.
that
is
they
existed
before
the
colonies
declared
war
and
they
existed
after.
and
there
is
--
there
is
no
indication
in
any
of
the
materials,
any
of
the
materials
that
the
congress
or
anybody
thought
that
the
power
rested
on
the
existence
of
war.
at
this
point,
let
me
go
forward
into
history
to
say
that
during
the
period
of
1790
that
colonel
wiener
was
talking
about
this
afternoon,
saw
this
great
number
of
instances
in
which
he
couldn't
understand
why
--
why
they
had
court-martial
jurisdiction.
those
court-martial
papers
don't
indicate
that
anybody
thought
that
the
time
of
war
was
existing
in
the
1790s
either
because
of
an
indian
war
out
in
the
northwest
territory
or
elsewhere.
there
was
no
indication
in
the
--
in
the
history
of
the
--
in
the
material
of
those
times
that
anyone
thought
that
power
over
the
--
over
service
connected
personnel
rested
on
war.
on
the
contrary
--
and
this
i
think
is
too
significant
that
when
they
were
trying
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
inhabitants
generally,
then,
they
thought
they
were
resting
on
--
on
war
powers.
the
special
result
which
related
of
the
continental
congress
which
gave
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
inhabitants
generally
for
interfering
with
the
army,
washington
recognized
that
there
is
a
special
war
power,
but
there
is
no
such
similar
significance
or
recognition
with
respect
to
these
service
connected
personnel.
the
--
the
legislation
and
the
practice
goes
off
before
the
revolutionary
war
to
after.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
there
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
1775
before
july
4th,
massachusetts
bay
passed
an
article
of
war
which
is
similar
to
the
one
i've
just
mentioned
about
jurisdiction
over
settlers,
returners
to
the
camp
or
all
persons
serving
with
the
armies
in
the
field.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
--
if
i
may
go
back,
mr.
justice,
in
1765,
department
of
westminster
passed
the
statute
saying
that
we
are
british
forces,
we're
overseas
at
minorca
and
gibraltar,
annapolis
royal
and
other
places
where
our
troops
maybe
commanded,
where
our
form
of
civil
judicature
is
not
enforced,
then,
persons
subject
to
command
or
the
commanding
officer
who
would
otherwise
be
subject
to
court-martial
shall
be
tried
for
common
law
types
of
offenses
in
those
areas
and
that
--
that
statute
was
passed
in
1765.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know
about
the
new
state,
but
the
continental
congress
did
deal
with
court-martial
jurisdiction
in
a
way,
i
think
that
goes
counter
to
the
argument
found
in
the
other
side
because
the
extended
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
witnesses
who
appeared
before
courts-martial
and
were
contemptuous
or
refused
to
answer
even
though
they
were
civilians.
and
they
refused
definitively
to
limit
that
kind
of
contempt
jurisdiction
of
courts-martial
only
to
service
men.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
then,
in
this
whole
period
before
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
great
deal
of
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
civilians.
true
a
large
part
of
it
was
in
time
of
war,
but
i
say
again
that
there
was
no
recognition
that
it
was
war
that
gave
the
power
in
this
case.
and,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
all
the
contrary
opposing
statements
upon
which
reliance
is
based
related
to
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
inhabitants
generally
not
over
service
connected
personnels.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
they've
used
“armies
in
the
field.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
except
that
the
1765
statute
of
great
britain
which
used
it
wherever
our
--
our
(inaudible)
or
civil
judicature
is
not
in
force.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
--
i
think
that
it
implies
a
body
of
troops
together
for
a
purpose
such
as
our
troops
are
abroad
that
they're
for
a
purpose
and
they
are
in
an
organized
fashion.
i
think
that's
what
--
what
both
these
statutes,
these
articles
of
war
and
the
later
ones
we're
dealing
with.
they
were
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
talking
to
both,
both.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
when
they
were
in
camp.
in
--
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
whenever
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
army
--
army
--
one
of
the
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
one
of
the
things
that
our
troops
abroad
are
doing
is
preparing
for
the
possibility
of
war
and
their
in
the
field
that
in
--
in
preparing
for
that
possibility.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
i
think
it
was
a
reference
to
the
army
in
camp
and
in
training
and
in
marching
and
there
were
lots
of
people
who
were
court-martialed.
colonel
wiener
says
in
the
1790s,
there
must
have
been
a
state
of
war.
there
were
lots
of
people
who
were
court-martialed
in
the
1790s
at
army
camps
and
cantonments
where
there
was
no
actual
hostilities
going
on
in
that
area.
i
think
that
was
true
probably
that
we
don't
have
too
many
instances
of
it
in
the
1780s.
we
have
a
few
even
after
the
treaty
--
even
after
the
treaty
of
peace
with
paris.
so,
i
think
the
reference
was
not
to
feel
the
meaning
war,
but
the
reference
was
to
the
army
in
an
organized
situation
at
a
cantonment
camp
on
the
march.
and
that
is
the
way
it's
been
interpreted
--
was
interpreted
throughout
the
19th
century
until
these
very
late
19th
century
decisions
of
the
judge
advocate
general
and
the
statements
of
colonel
wiener
to
which
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
yes.
these
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
when
they
were
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
service
connected
personnel
in
washington
i
suppose
as
there
are
today.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir.
they're
not
in
the
field.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
where
there
is
no
form
of
our
civil
judicature
is
in
force.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
i
think
it
does.
it
does
not
in
terms.
but
i
think
it
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
does
have
that
because
i
think
it's
a
constant
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'll
talk
about
it
right
now,
mr.
justice
because
i
think
it's
important.
it
begins
at
the
1765
statute
to
which
i
refer
the
british
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
george
iii.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
the
parliament
of
great
britain
mr.
justice
was
the
one
that
enacted
the
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
not
that
i
know
of.
not
about
that
act.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
didn't
think
--
i
don't
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
find
that
it
was
that
act
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
was
general
martial
law
declared
for
the
inhabitants
generally.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
was
not
--
not
the
statute
which
provided
that
those
people
under
the
command
of
the
commanding
general
shall
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
was
not
under
that
statute.
in
1802,
the
congress
passed
a
provision
providing
for
a
court-martial
of
persons
committing
murder
on
naval
vessels
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
this
in
our
view
covered
not
only
naval
personnel
or
military
personnel
but
civilian
seamen
who
existed
in
those
days
aboard
the
naval
vessels.
and
the
judge
--
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
was
asked
to
rule
early
in
the
19th
century
on
the
question
of
whether
that
statute
applied
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
within
the
maritime
bound
--
waters.
and
he
said,
“no,
it
doesn't”
because
the
reason
congress
passed
the
statute
outside
was
because
our,
he
didn't
used
these
terms
but
our
form
of
civil
judicature
doesn't
exist
on
the
high
seas
and
that's
why
congress
specifically
provided
for
the
court-martial
of
persons
committing
murder
on
naval
vessels.
in
fact,
throughout
most
of
the
19th
century,
it
was
most
extraordinary
for
any
of
our
service
people
or
service
connected
people
to
be
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
at
all
unless
they're
on
naval
vessels.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
by
court-martial
in
that
instance.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
1802,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
this
is
a
board
naval
vessel.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
board
naval
vessel,
yes,
this
was
board
naval
vessels.
then,
in
1866,
general
holt,
the
(inaudible)
judge
advocate
general
who
was
asked
to
give
an
opinion
on
which
we
quote
in
our
--
in
our
brief
and
with
--
on
the
jurisdiction
over
service
connected
personnel
in
the
field.
and
he
says
that
it
covered
--
he
says,
not
only
as
his
ruling
but
he's
giving
a
historical
statement
of
what
the
general
usage
of
the
service
was.
and
he
said
in
1866
that
the
general
use
--
usage
of
the
service
of
the
army
in
time
of
peace
was
that
this
in
the
field
category
cover
units
on
the
march
or
in
a
place
remote
from
civil
jurisdiction.
so,
again,
you
find
this
reference
to
place
remote
from
civil
jurisdiction
and
then
we
come,
i
should
have
said
this
before,
to
colonel
winthrop's
own
comment
on
the
1863
murder
statute
which
provided
for
the
first
time
that
murder
and
other
important
felony
should
be
tried
during
the
time
of
war
by
court-martial
and
colonel
winthrop
--
winthrop's
commentary
is
very
significant.
he
said,
“the
reason
congress
did
that
is
because
at
those
times,
the
courts
were
probably
closed
and
the
civil
jurisdiction
wouldn't
be
opened
so
it
was
important
in
order
to
furnish
these
offenses
that
they'd
be
tried
by
court-martial.”
so,
again,
you
see
the
same
threat
where
our
form
of
civil
judicature
does
not
exist,
congress
has
the
right
to
pass
court-martial
statutes.
and
then
you
come
to
--
to
the
late
19th
century
opinions
upon
which
colonel
wiener
and
mr.
kalp
relies
so
heavily
relate
to
post
traitor
and
others,
we
think
these
are
--
these
are
explained
in
exactly
the
same
way
because
in
the
late
19th
century,
the
civil
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
had
covered
the
entire
continent,
there
was
no
place
where
you
couldn't
get
to
a
federal
district
court
at
that
time
and
this
seems
to
me
explicitly
in
a
few
instances
and
implicitly
the
underlying
basis
of
all
those
decisions.
they
talk
about
within
the
united
states.
they
say
civil
jurisdiction
exists.
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
to
try
these
people
by
court-martial.
there
is
no
reason
why
you
can't
take
him
take
mr.
so
and
so
to
the
district
court
from
nebraska
which
is
sitting
right
near
omaha
in
one
of
the
opinions
we
printed
by
colonel
wiener
and
i
think
in
the
appendix
to
his
brief
in
the
wilson
case
and
then,
i
come
to
general
crowder
in
1912
to
1916.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
this
was
not
first
proposed
in
1916.
it
was
first
proposed
in
1912
in
the
revision
of
the
articles
of
war
which
had
the
approval
of
secretary
of
war,
stimson
and
this
appears
very
clearly
from
the
reports.
and
that
the
--
the
statements
which
were
made
by
general
crowder
were
made
a
different
hearing
to
those
years,
some
in
1912
and
some
in
1916.
and,
his
--
he
--
his
statements
i
think
are
not
inexplicable
as
colonel
wiener
said
today.
i
think
they
are
perfectly
explicable.
he
understood
that
the
touchstone
was
the
absence
of
civil
jurisdiction.
he
understood
that
there
was
nothing
inconsistent
between
what
had
been
said
by
the
judge
advocate
general
in
the
--
in
the
latter
part
of
the
19th
century
and
what
he
was
proposing
in
1912
and
1916
because
he
understood,
that
the
rule
that
they
were
applying
only
have
--
only
had
reference
to
places
where
our
civil
jurisdiction
existed.
it
didn't
exist
in
cuba
under
our
peaceful
occupation
of
1906
or
1907.
it
didn't
exist
when
our
troops
were
going
through
canada
as
he
--
another
example
that
he
mentioned.
it
didn't
exist
in
other
places.
and
so,
therefore,
he
didn't
see
that
there
was
any
inconsistency
and
i
submit
that
there
was
none
between
that
the
--
the
opinions
that
he
had
himself
formally
promulgated
in
the
digest
of
1912
opinions
which
had
been
issued
in
the
--
in
the
latter
part
of
the
19th
century
and
--
and
the
proposal
that
he
was
making
to
congress.
because
he
knew
that
at
--
in
the
area
which
was
to
be
covered
by
article
2
(d)
--
2
(d)
as
it
then
was
article
2
(11)
as
it
is
today,
there
was
no
form
of
our
civil
judicature
in
effect.
and
he
also
saw
that
unlike
what
had
been
known
to
the
people
in
the
end
of
the
19th
century,
the
spanish-american
war
had
ushered
in
new
era
to
the
united
states.
we
have
had
occupations
in
cuba.
it
was
also
that
--
that
the
war
which
was
then
pending
in
europe
in
1916
might
bring
similar
types
of
--
of
deployment
of
troops
abroad.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
article
2
(d)
as
far
as
i
can
determine
was
precisely
in
the
same
form
in
1912
as
it
was
when
it
was
adopted
in
1916.
it
did
not
get
through
congress
in
1912
or
in
intervening
years
and
it
was
finally
enacted
in
1916.
i
won't
dwell
because
the
court
knows
it
as
well
better
than
i
do
on
the
--
on
the
situation
that
--
that
existed
after
world
war
ii
as
far
as
the
need
for
placing
troops
abroad,
but
of
course,
that
is
the
need
which
led
to
the
--
the
codification
and
--
clarification
of
article
2
(11)
in
the
uniform
code
in
1950.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
--
i
know
nothing
about
the
dependents,
but
i
do
know
about
the
employees
because
that
was
the
very
occasion
for
general
crowder's
suggestion
into
congress
that
article
2
(a)
(b)
enlarged.
there
was
a
civilian
order
to
accompany
the
troops
to
cuba
in
1906
and
1907
and
who
--
embezzled
some
funds
there.
and
general
crowder
said
to
the
congress,
he
could
not
be
charged
of
--
he
embezzled
federal
funds,
he
could
not
be
charged
because
this
didn't
come
under
the
old
article
of
war
which
only
covered
wartime.
this
was
a
peacetime
occupation
of
cuba
and
he
said
there
is
no
reason
why
he
--
this
auditor
of
this
type
shouldn't
be
covered
by
court-martial
jurisdiction
when
we're
occupying
cuba
non-hostile.
and,
it's
--
i
think
it's
important
that
he
said
this
is
not
a
new
jurisdiction.
this
is
something
we
have
always
done
in
1912
and
1916.
mr.

davis

as
far
as
employees
are
concerned,
and
it
--
it
is
shown
both
by
the
record
in
number
21,
the
guagliardo
case
and
by
this
case,
these
service
connected
personnels
serving
overseas
work
in
the
same
place,
most
often
side-by-side
with
military
personnel
were
under
the
same
command
of
the
commanding
officer.
they
frequently
exercised
command
over
enlisted
personnel
as
well
as
being
commanded
by
officer
or
military
personnel.
they
have
the
same
military
privileges
and
benefits.
they
are
accepted
and
treated
by
the
local
host
nation
and
the
local
populace
as
part
of
the
military
contingent.
they
view
themselves
as
part
of
military
contingent.
they
are
thought
of
by
the

the

france,
in
this

morocco
in

as

as
responsible

mr.
oscar

if
i
may,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
will
have
to
come
to
argue
in
a
moment
the
issue
of
capital
charge
here
if
i
may
delay
until
then
because
that
--
my
--
my
particular
case
here
depends
on
that
because
of
course,
this
is
the
same
as
the
covert
case
except
that
this
man
is
a
--
an
employee
rather
than
a
dependent,
but
the
reason
i
--
i
put
it
off
is
because
before
i
can
try
to
attempt
to
show
you
that
a
capital
offense
should
be
treated
differently,
i
have
to
show
you
that
employees
at
all
shall
be
treated
--
shall
be
subject
to
court-martial
jurisdiction.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
our
form
of
civil
judicature
does
not
exist.
mr.
oscar

that's
a
terribly
significant
one,
mr.
justice.

judicature.
that
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
it
does
now
and
--
and
the
reason
that
didn't
exist
as
i
--
as
i
believe,
up
to
recently,
it
does
exist
now,
the
reason
it
didn't
--
pardon?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no,
but
their
system.
perhaps
--
let
me
--
let
me
explain
what
i'm
driving
at.
colonel
wiener
in
reciting
something
from
samuel
talked
about
military
jurisdiction
existing
where
a
civil
jurisdiction
does
not
exist.
and
he
assumed
sub
silentio
that
the
civil
jurisdiction
that
samuel
was
talking
about
that
the
18th
century
and
19th
century
british
materials
were
talking
about
was
the
civil
jurisdiction
of
the
other
country.
that
is
not
so.
they
were
talking
about
--
i
believe
it
is
not
so.
they
were
talking
about
british
civil
jurisdiction.
now,
of
course,
in
many
cases,
british
civil
jurisdiction
did
exist
overseas
in
india
for
instance
and
other
places.
i
think
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
1765
statute
is
the
--
is
the
--
the
true
touchstone
where
our
form
of
civil
judicature
does
not
exist.
that
is
for
the
british
where
their
form
civil
jurisdiction
did
not
exist
whereas,
where
our
form
of
civil
jurisdiction
does
not
exist
because
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
england
recently
passed
a
statute
covering
dependents.
they
did
not
cover
dependents
until
i
think
1956.
and
they
did
not
cover
all
civilian
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
and
it
does
--
so
that
england
is
--
has
the
same
jurisdiction
for
which
we
argue
here
now.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
believe
it
is
cited
in
--
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
harlan.
it's
cited
in
your
opinion
in
the
--
in
the
covert
case
and
it's
printed
in
--
in
one
of
the
briefs
in
the
covert
--
in
our
one
of
the
government's
briefs
in
the
covert
case.
the
--
the
alternatives
have
been
discussed
before
the
court.
the
alter
--
the
only
real
alternative
as
i
think
in
most
cases
is
trial
in
a
foreign
court.
there
is
something
to
be
said
to
trial
in
a
foreign
court,
but
congress
has
opted
against
it.
congress
has
very
decisively
decided
that
american
service
connected
personnel
should
not
be
tried
in
foreign
courts
and,
there
are
reasons
--
very
good
reasons
supporting
that
judgment
of
congress.
the
first
is
that,
foreign
nations
are
not
too
interested
in
offenses
committed
by
american
personnel,
which
do
not
involve
foreign
personnel
or
the
foreign
country.
they
are
not
too
interested
and
this
has
been
proved
by
the
experience
since
world
war
ii.
they're
not
too
interested
in
offenses
by
one
american
against
another
american
or
involving
the
american
airbase
even
if
it
were
--
even
it
is
a
crime
under
the
foreign
law.
and
then
of
course,
many
of
these
dealings,
these
offenses
are
not
crimes
under
the
foreign
law.
all
the
security
offenses,
the
violations
of
the
base
commander's
regulations,
in
some
countries,
narcotic
offenses
are
not
violations
of
the
local
law.
safety
regulations
on
the
base,
those
are
not
--
are
frequently
not
violations
of
the
local
law.
so,
if
there
is
no
method
of
trying
americans
who
commit
those
offenses,
they
cannot
be
tried
and
punished
at
all.
and
then,
congress
was
aware
of
the
disadvantages
to
the
defendant
in
the
trial
in
foreign
courts.
no
doubt,
in
many
countries
in
the
world,
congress
--
a
defendant
will
receive
a
very
fair
trial,
but
there
are
other
countries
in
which
that
cannot
be
said.
at
least
in
trial,
it
was
not
conform
to
our
standards
of
--
or
our
views
of
what
is
a
fair
and
just
trial
and
congress
was
aware
of
this,
and
it
made
its
choice.
and
in
this
connection,
i
think
i
should
say
that
there
is
quite
a
possibility
that
if
it's
held
that
any
of
these
service
connected
personnel
are
not
subject
to
military
jurisdiction,
then
the
argument
would
probably
be
made
by
some
of
the
countries
abroad
that
that
so-called,
“nato
safeguards,”
the
safeguards
which
we
--
which
were
put
in
to
the
treaty
to
protect
the
americans
tried
in
foreign
courts
do
not
apply
to
these
people
just
as
they
don't
apply
to
tourists
abroad
because
the
nato
safeguards
only
apply
to
people
subject
in
military
jurisdiction
who
are
turned
over
or
whose
trial
is
had
by
the
foreign
state.
i
don't
want
to
say
to
the
court
that
this
is
necessarily
a
correct
interpretation
of
that
treaty
but
this
is
an
argument
which
has
been
made
and
which
i
have
no
doubt
would
be
brought
forward,
but
if
these
people
--
if
these
people
are
not
treated
as
part
of
the
military,
then,
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement
with
its
safeguards
does
not
apply
to
them
in
any
way.
trial
in
the
united
states
is
also
been
discussed.
i
don't
want
to
say
anymore
on
that
except
to
point
out
that
we
have
no
assurance
that
foreign
countries
will
allow
persons
--
americans
committing
crimes
abroad
to
be
brought
to
this
country.
they
don't
have
to
do
it
because
as
the
court
knows
from
the
gerard
case,
they
have
jurisdiction
--
territorial
jurisdiction.
they
--
we
cannot
just
pick
up
an
american
and
bring
him
to
this
country
if
he
has
committed
an
offense
abroad.
we
have
to
do
it
with
the
explicit
or
implicit
consent
of
the
foreign
country.
we
have
no
assurance
that
that
will
be
done.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
has
been
an
obstacle
about
that.
that
is
--
many
people
think
that
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
justice
black,
i
cannot
say
to
you
that
formal
requests
have
been
made
and
turned
down,
but
the
--
what
i
say
is
based
upon
the
general
feeling
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
that
that
this,
a
request
to
foreign
countries
particularly
to
certain
foreign
countries
to
allow
us
to
bring
people
back
to
the
united
states
for
trial
will
not
be
graded
with
receptivity
because
of
the
general
rule
which
we
have
for
ourselves
that
the
territorial
sovereign
has
jurisdiction.
and
we
have
extradition
treaties
don't
apply
because
extradition
treaties
apply
where
the
offense
is
committed
in
one
sovereign
in
one
state
and
the
offender
then
goes
to
the
other
state.
that's
not
true
here.
the
offense
is
committed
in
france
and
grisham
has
not
fled
to
the
united
states
or
he
didn't
commit
the
crime
in
united
states
and
then
flee
to
france.
so,
extradition
treaties
don't
apply.
the
other
types
of
--
of
civil
courts
abroad
run
into
the
difficulties
of
the
capitulations,
the
canceling
of
tribunals
and
so
forth,
and
other
difficulties
which
were
pointed
out
by
members
of
the
court
in
the
opinions
in
the
covert
case.
i
should
like
to
say,
mr.
chief
justice
that
i'm
not
quite
sure
it
was
made
clear
in
the
guagliardo
case
that
the
160,000
defense
department
civilians
who
are
not
subject
to
court-martial
are
not
american
citizens.
there
are
a
large
number
of
--
of
local
nationals
who
were
employed
abroad
by
the
defense
department
of
various
bases
throughout
the
country.
they
are
not
subject
to
court-martial
jurisdiction
because
they
are
not
american
nationals
and
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
local
country.
as
far
as
i
know,
there
are
no
american
employees
of
the
defense
department
in
this
category
who
are
not
subject
to
--
to
court-martial
jurisdiction.
now,
i
come
mr.
justice
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
can't
commit
an
offense
mr.
justice
brennan
against
our
military
code
because
they
are
not
subject
to
it.
they
may
commit
an
offense
which
would
be
con
--
con
--
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
nothing
can
happen
except
that
they
have
to
be
dismissed
and
excluded
from
the
base.
attempt
sir
--
i
think
on
the
whole,
this
can
be
handled
administratively
because
they
are
not
ordinarily
given
a
classifying
information.
they're
not
put
in
--
in
--
ordinarily
put
in
positions
where
they
can
commit
offenses
of
this
type.
they
do
commit
larcenies
as
was
indicated
in
the
--
i'm
not
even
certain
that
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
narcotics?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
all
they
can
be
done
is
they
would
be
excluded
from
the
base,
that's
all.
dismissed
from
employment
and
excluded
from
the
base.
there
is
nothing
else
that
can
be
done.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
and
in
some
countries,
in
some
countries
mr.
justice
black,
the
treaty
--
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement
itself
provides
that
nationals
of
that
country
shall
not
be
subject
to
our
jurisdiction.
so,
in
those
countries,
it's
not
only
because
they
are
not
covered
by
the
--
the
military
code.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
want
it
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
want
to
qualify
on
what
you've
said
in
this
mean
to
qualify
my
answer.
i
do
not
think
that
they
are
outside
the
land
of
naval
forces
necessarily
if
they
are
not
brought
outside
--
brought
outside
that
provision
by
a
treaty
or
an
agreement
or
with
the
local
state
as
they
are
in
most
cases.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
are
not
subject
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
very
few
because
as
you
see,
article
2
(11)
itself
says,
“subject
to
international
arrangements
and
so
on,”
so
it
incorporates
this.
most
agreements,
the
nato
and
i
think
most
of
the
others
do
not
make
local
nationals
subject
to
our
court-martial
jurisdiction.
it
maybe
that
in
morocco,
an
englishman
is
working
for
the
american
airbase
there
and
it
maybe
that
he
is
subject
to
--
to
a
court-martial
jurisdiction
but
by
and
large,
the
answer
that
i
gave
to
the
chief
justice
is
--
is
accurate.
that
is
that
the
great
--
the
bulk
of
the
local
employees
who
are
hired
from
the
area
are
not
subject
to
court-martial
jurisdiction
because
of
the
treaty
and
arrangements
that
are
made
with
the
local
states.
i
come,
mr.
justice
harlan
to
the
--
the
nub
of
this
particular
case
which
is
that
--
the
capital
punishment
aspect
of
it.
i
cannot
argue
of
course
that
--
that
it
is
harder
to
try
civilians
--
civilian
employees
accused
of
capital
crimes
in
the
united
states
than
it
is
to
try
dependents.
that
factor
is
the
same
in
both
cases.
the
difference
that
i
think
that
does
exists
between
the
covert
case
and
this
case,
the
differences
are
two
or
shall
i
say,
two
and
a
half.
the
first,
i
think
is
that
the
--
the
history
of
jurisdiction
over
civilian
employees,
though
we
think
the
history
supports
the
jurisdiction
over
dependents
as
well
in
its
specific
instances,
is
greater
with
respect
to
employees
and
more
consistent
throughout
the
two
centuries
since
the
18th
century.
there
is
a
consistent
line.
colonel
wiener
could
not
say
in
this
case
that
there
were
only
two
persons,
court-martialed
by
--
court-martial
--
of
civilian
employees
court-martialed
as
he
said
in
the
other
case.
there
is
a
--
a
much
greater
bulk
of
history
and
though
we
think
that
that
doesn't
mean
that
employees
are
different
from
dependents,
we
do
think
that
it's
one
of
the
factors
that
has
to
be
thrown
into
the
balance
in
weighing
the
power
and
jurisdiction
of
the
congress
with
respect
to
capital
offenses
and
the
second
factor
--
and
in
that
connection
--
and
this
is
the
half
argument
that
i've
mentioned
before,
in
that
connection,
we
think
that
there
is
a
--
a
law
--
a
history
of
subjection
of
employees
to
capital
offenses.
the
naval
murder
statute
of
1802
that
i've
mentioned
which
covers
civilian
seamen
is
--
is
a
prime
example
which
doesn't
exist
in
the
case
of
employee
--
of
dependent
but
which
does
exist
in
the
case
of
employees.
so
that
adds
we
think
to
the
--
of
the
factors
which
throw
the
balance
the
other
way
in
this
case,
that
is
the
--
the
more
consistent,
the
more
specific
history.
the
second
factor
is
that
the
--
if
--
before
i
go
to
the
second
factor,
i
do
want
to
say
that
i
think
there
are
times
when
history
is
the
crucial
balance
weight
and
this
is
i
think
one
of
them.
this
is
a
case
where
i
think
history
is
a
crucial
balance
weight.
the
balance
went
the
other
way
in
the
covert
case.
the
history
here
which
was
not
before
court
in
this
--
in
extent
in
covert
because
covert
dealt
with
dependents
and
not
with
employees,
swings
the
balance
the
other
way
for
employees.
but,
aside
from
the
history
which
i
think
is
the
crucial
factor,
you
do
have
a
relationship
with
these
employees
to
the
armed
forces.
they
are
more
functionally
related
to
the
armed
forces.
they
do
the
work
of
the
armed
forces.
they
do
the
same
work
in
many
instances
as
enlisted
and
officer
personnel.
their
work
is
necessary
for
the
--
for
the
completion
of
the
--
of
the
program
projects
of
the
armed
forces.
in
many
instances,
they
can
harm
by
their
offenses.
they
can
harm
the
armed
forces
more
than
a
dependent
could
do
because
dependents
are
ordinarily
don't
have
access
to
--
to
equipment
which
today
is
very
complicated
and
very
important
electronic
equipment
and
dependents
ordinarily
don't
have
access
to
classified
information,
things
like
that.
so
that,
an
offense
by
a
civilian
employee
can
have
a
more
direct
impact
on
the
actual
operation
of
the
armed
forces
than
--
than
possibly
a
--
by
enlarged
in
defense
by
a
dependent.
and
so
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
many
of
these
people
still
do.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
i'm
not
certain
and
i
say
somewhat
tentatively
that
i
think
that
probably
most
of
these
civilian
employees
have
an
assimilated
rank.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
if
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
the
important
factor,
mr.
justice
but,
a
rank
has
its
privileges
and
other
than
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
--
i
don't
know
--
i
think
what
--
guagliardo
had
access
to
the
officer's
club.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
that
--
i
don't
know.
i
think
that
he
--
that
he
--
well
it's
called
as
--
i
don't
even
think
thing
is
called
assimilated
rank,
i
think
it
probably
assimilated
rank.
i
may
not
be
using
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
i
think
many
of
them
still
do
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
he
was
treated
as
a
member
of
the
military
forces
of
the
country.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
sheds
a
great
deal
of
light.
and
so
it's
--
it's
these
two
factors,
the
history
and
the
close
and
direct
connection,
the
impact
on
the
military
that
we
think
makes
a
difference
between
this
case
and
the
covert
case.
i
don't
want
to
argue
to
the
court
because
i
--
i
don't
think
i
can
that
it's
harder
to
try
civilians
--
civilian
employees
for
murder
in
the
united
states
than
its
hard
--
than
to
try
mrs.
covert
or
dorothy
krueger
smith.
the
armed
forces
thinks
--
think
it's
hard
enough
in
both
cases,
but
the
--
but
the
crucial
differences
are
the
history
and
the
--
and
the
difference
in
the
relationship.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
that
distinction
was
first
articulated
in
the
--
in
the
concurring
opinions
in
the
covert
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
there
certainly
was
a
distinction
that
congress
made
between
capital
crimes
and
non-capital
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
haven't
found
any
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
only
thing
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
only
matters
mr.
justice
black
of
the
inference
of
that
one
can
draw
from
the
difference
in
treatment
congress
has
made
between
capital
offenses
in
the
articles
of
war
and
non-capital
offenses.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
perhaps,
i
would
not
mr.
justice.
but
since
the
court
has
held
in
the
covert
case
that
on
--
on
what
is
certainly
a
reasonable
basis
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
it
has
been
done.
it
has
been
done
in
the
due
process
field.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
but
i
think
it's
--
it's
a
clause
which
indicates
that
the
courts
when
the
issue
comes
before
them
have
to
weigh
the
various
relevant
factors
in
determining
whether
a
certain
action
by
congress
is
valid
or
is
not
valid
in
the
circumstances
and
the
factor
of
capital
--
capitality
has
been
mentioned.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no
explicit
reference,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
justice,
i
--
i
think
the
short
answer
is
that,
there
has
never
been
any
indication
to
that
effect.
the
selective
draft
of
our
cases
in
1917
and
this
is
in
our
reply
brief,
refer
to
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
the
sweeping
clause
has
qualifying
and
modifying
the
court-martial
clause
as
well
as
the
other
clauses.
there
is
a
part
of
the
opinion
in
the
court
in
that
case
which
refers
to
the
power
that
raised
on
this
and
the
court-martial
clause
and
say,
of
course,
each
of
these
powers
is
subject
and
qualified
by
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
and
i
think
that's
been
the
historical
accepted
view
supporting
the
army
by
what
hamilton
said
before
the
--
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
were
adopted,
but
it's
also
supported
by
the
fact
that
there's
nothing
in
the
history
that
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
insofar
as
we've
been
able
to
find
which
indicates
any
hostility
to
court-martial
jurisdiction.
there
was
hostility
to
--
in
some
places
to
a
standing
army
and
there
was
hostility
to
--
to
large
military
forces,
but
the
court-martial
jurisdiction
is
known.
in
fact,
the
very
same
--
many
of
the
same
states
which
have
proposed
limitation
on
a
standing
army
as
part
of
the
bill
of
rights
which
was
not
adopted
but
they
proposed
it,
also
proposed
the
exception
in
the
fifth
amendment
for
cases
arising
in
the
land
and
naval
forces.
so,
we
think
that
shows
that
there
wasn't
any
necessary
connection
between
on
the
one
hand
hostility
to
a
standing
army
and
on
the
other
hand,
hostility
to
court-martial
jurisdictions.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
we
think
that
even
without
the
proper
and
necessary
clause,
the
history
shows
that
these
people
were
part
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
and
we
think
that's
one
of
the
--
the
significant
operative
points
of
the
history
to
show
that
land
and
naval
forces
was
not
limited
to
--
to
people
who
are
enlisted
on
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
certainly,
there
were
some
fears
that
jury
trial
might
be
abolished
for
the
country
as
a
whole.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
but
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
find
nothing
in
the
history
which
indicates
any
specific
or
even
the
number
of
fears
about
the
court-martial
clause
with
which
we're
dealing
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
bill
of
rights
has
an
exception
for
cases
arising
in
land
and
naval
forces.
so,
any
--
anything
that
falls
within
clause
14
would
necessarily
accept
it
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
we
think
also
mr.
justice
black
that
the
sweeping
clause,
to
use
that
term,
does
help
to
determine
what's
within
the
land
and
naval
--
naval
forces.
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
rely
on
it
in
any
of
these
cases
but
we
do
wish
to
rely
upon
it
if
any
of
the
members
of
the
court
should
think
it
necessarily.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
know
my
time
has
expired
but
i
would
like
to
explain
what
may
appear
to
the
court
as
the
most
extraordinary
discrepancy
in
statistics
if
--
when
--
when
they
come
to
read
the
brief.
in
the
appendix
in
the
guagliardo
case,
there
is
a
listing
of
various
civilian
employees
and
civilian
dependents.
it's
page
110
and
111.
at
the
very
end
of
the
whole
listing,
you
will
find
the
phrase
location
unknown
and
you
will
find
34,472
dependents.
well,
the
armed
forces
do
lose
people
but
it
doesn't
lose
that
enormous
number
of
people
and
so,
i
would
like
to
explain
how
that
--
that
occurred.
the
total
number
of
dependents
was
gathered
by
adding
up
what
the
various
sponsors
--
the
sponsors
are
the
servicemen
who
--
who
go
abroad
what
reports
they
send
in.
but
that
the
listing
by
individual
countries
comes
from
the
base
and
stations
overseas,
the
base
commander
sending
that
i
have
so
many
dependents.
there
are
a
large
number
of
sponsors,
servicemen
who
do
not
report
to
their
local
base
commander,
the
civilian
dependents
within
there
because
they're
not
entitled
to
quarters
or
something
other
like
that
and
so,
this
figure
of
34,000
doesn't
really
represent
people
are
actually
lost.
it
represents
number
of
civilian
dependents
who
have
not
been
reported
to
--
to
the
local
bases
and
stations
and
therefore,
don't
come
within
the
country
--
country
by
country
distribution
in
this
table.
