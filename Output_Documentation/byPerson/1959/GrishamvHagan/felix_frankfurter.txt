would
you
mind
if
it
doesn't
take
more
than
a
minute
or
two
to
explain
the
six-year
delay,
the
six-year
period?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
would
--
we
would
--
(voice

when
he
was
under
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on
from
there
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
when
was
the
--
when
was
the
final
approval
of
the
sentence
(inaudible)
was
approved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
argument
wasn't
dependent
likewise
but
it
was
in
like
dependents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
asked
this
because
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
that's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
are
we
questionable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
far
as
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
it
--
i
here
take
it
(inaudible)
that's
not
improving
here
properly
but
i
think
it
concerned
with
the
problem
and
what
to
do
about
it
primarily
that
is
the
pentagon
rather
than
the
department
of
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
problem
--
but
the
problem
is
that
of
the
--
of
the
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
that's
what
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
when
there
are
housing
facilities,
are
they
also
subject
to
domiciliary
or
base
rules
of
hours
of
being
in
or
out,
things
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
extensively
--
about
how
many
people
are
involved
in
these
dependents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
450
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
--
on
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
civilians.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
the
grisham
type
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
roughly,
of
what
--
of
what
magnitude?(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
one
--
one
state
removed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
chosen
under
your
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
--
that
the
source
of
--
the
nature
of
my
interest
is,
what
--
what
–
how
close
--
what
is
the
nature
of
the
nexus,
the
actual
nexus
between
these
employees
and
the
army
establishment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
might
be
different
if
some
representative
of
general
electric
or
westinghouse
assuming
they're
doing
something
for
you,
for
the
government
that
they
send
over
their
top
engineer
to
look
at
the
things
he
wouldn't
be
deemed
-
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
nature
of
the
employment
you
would
take
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
nature
of
the
employment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
between
1765
and
the
1776,
but
the
--
was
there
a
legislation
dealing
with
courts-martial,
not
dealing
with
your
specific
question
immediately,
was
there
a
legislation
emanating
both
from
westminster
instead
of
general
court
of
massachusetts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
there
was
--
so
that
the
colonies
passed
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
then,
between
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
have
the
benefit
--
it's
one
of
our
recent
decisions,
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
to
our
--
as
to
american
legislation
using
that
comprehensively
both
colonial
and
new
state
for
the
continental
congress.
if
they
used
the
phrase
“in
the
field,”
what
would
be
the
--
that
--
what
was
that
juxtaposed
to?
when
were
they
not
in
the
field
apart
from
war
in
the
united
states?
when
were
they
not
in
the
field?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
“field,”
you
mean
just
to
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
(voice
overlap)
army
gains,
army
gains?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
legislation
which
used
the
phrase,
“in
the
field.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
application
did
it
have
to
pursue
justice
stewart's
question
unless
it
would
be
reference
to
the
field
of
war?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
there
have
been
--
would
there
have
been
no
service
connected
non-uniform
persons
with
the
army
when
they
weren't
in
the
field?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
would
--
when
they
were
not
in
the
field?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
phrase
on
which
you
so
heavily
rely
and
i
can
see
why,
(inaudible)
civil
judicature?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
phrase
--
did
that
phrase
either
in
terms
have
echoes
in
any
of
our
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
can
they
go
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
talk
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes,
george
iii.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
show
that
general
crowder
drafted
that
which
came
in
after
which
he
proposed
in
1916
but
that
was
done
in
1912?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
enacted
or
submitted
first
place
as
a
change
of
administration
and
second
place
to
word
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
name
of
that
attorney
in
the
famous
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
colonel
wiener
said
that
was
on
his
mind
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
treated
--
was
he
treated
–
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
sheds
some
light
on
what
his
function
is
significant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
–
(inaudible)
the
argument
if
i
understood
you
correctly
that
you
can
(inaudible)
draw
the,
what
i
mean
the,
(inaudible)
both
are
necessary
clause,
that
man
can
drawn
on
before
19
--
what
was
it
--
1793.
it
couldn't
(inaudible)
because
that
puts
a
limitation
for
proper
and
necessary
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
is
that
land
and
naval
forces
gave
the
qualification
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
plainly
enough,
these
are
not
--
these
are
not
literally
part
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
in
our
community
and
just
stated
and
since
that
--
since
they're
not
individual
reading
and
the
naval
forces,
the
qualification
to
the
just
the
sixth
amendment
give
you
no
comfort
unless
you
can
go
on
to
some
proper
and
necessary
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
madison
didn't
think
so.
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
there
for
the
bill
of
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
hope
mr.
justice
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
going
to
refresh
my
recollection.
