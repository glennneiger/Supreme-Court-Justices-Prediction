mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
--
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
here
another
action
of
habeas
corpus
testing
the
authority
or
seeking
to
test
the
authority
of
the
military
to
try
a
civilian
by
military
court-martial.
the
specific
question
involved
here
is
whether
the
constitution
permits
the
trial
of
civilian
employee
of
the
army
by
military
court-martial
in
france
for
a
capital
offense
in
time
of
peace.
the
judicial
history
of
this
case
began
in
december
1952
when
grisham
was
charged
with
the
--
he
was
then
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
as
i
say
a
civilian
employee
and
an
accountant
of
the
army,
serving
with
the
armed
forces
in
france
with
a
gs-9
civil
service
rating.
when
he
was
charged
with
the
capital
offense
of
premeditated
murder
under
article
118
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
he
was
tried
by
a
military
court-martial,
a
general
court-martial
convened
in
orleans,
france.
he
was
convicted
of
the
lesser
included
offense
of
unpremeditated
murder,
was
sentenced
to
35
or
to
life
imprisonment
and
hard
labor,
which
was
subsequently
reduced
to
35
years
by
executive
clemency.
grisham
has
exhausted
all
of
his
administrative
remedies
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
he
--
then,
on
october
26th,
1957
while
serving
his
sentence
at
the
united
states
penitentiary,
lewisburg,
pennsylvania,
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
with
another
district
alleging
that
his
confinement
was
in
violation
of
article
iii
and
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
of
the
constitution.
this
case
was
heard
before
honorable
frederick
b.
0bone
and
was
argued
and
on
april
22nd,
1958,
the
district
court
filed
an
opinion
dismissing
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
an
appeal
was
immediately
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
philadelphia,
which
was
argued
before
the
third
circuit
on
october
24,
1958.
on
november
20,
an
opinion
was
filed
by
the
court
of
appeals
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
opinion
by
judge
goodrich.
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
followed
which
is
the
question
now
before
this
court.
now
--
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
our
contention
is
that
there
is
absolutely
no
other
distinction
factually.
the
cases
are
identical
with
the
exception
of
that
fact.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
the
petitioner
had
been
employed
as
a
cost
accountant,
a
civil
service
employee
of
the
army
engineers
at
nashville,
tennessee
continuously
since
1936.
except
for
some
time,
some
leave
which
he
had
during
the
second
world
war
going
to
the
military.
in
september
1952,
he
was
temporarily
assigned
by
the
district
engineers
at
nashville
to
duty
with
the
district
engineers
at
orleans,
france.
now,
while
employed
by
the
nashville
office
of
the
district
engineers,
his
work
consisted
primarily
of
multiple
purpose
setting
up
cost
accounting
systems
in
connection
with
multiple
purpose
dams
and
river
and
harbor
improvements,
civil
works.
when
he
was
assigned
to
the
orleans
office
in
france
with
the
district
engineers,
he
was
given
a
job
of
setting
up
a
cost
accounting
system
for
communications
line
between
germany
and
france.
he
arrived
in
france
on
october
1st,
1952.
his
wife
arrived
about
november
30th,
1952.
and
he
and
his
wife
were
living
in
the
city
of
orleans
in
an
apartment
rented
from
a
french
civilian.
they
were
not
living
on
the
military
base.
on
the
night
of
december
6th,
the
petitioner
and
his
wife
attended
a
cocktail
party
given
by
an
officer
at
the
base
and
both
of
them
had
a
considerable
amount
of
drink.
early
in
the
morning
of
december
7th,
the
next
morning
of
1952,
the
petitioner
notified
both
the
french
civilian
authorities
and
the
united
states
military
authorities
that
his
wife
was
dead.
he
was
subsequently
questioned
by
the
french
military
authorities
who
arrested
him
for
murder.
he
was
held
by
the
french
military
authorities
under
that
charge
from
december
7th
until
december
23rd,
1952
at
which
time,
he
was
released
to
the
united
states
military
authorities
upon
request
under
the
status
of
forces
treaty
then
in
effect
in
france.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
outside
of
the
fact
that
he
was
working
on
a
communications
cost
accounting
system
for
communications
line
between
germany
and
france.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
work
he
was
doing
was
essential
or
necessary
to
any
purely
military
function
of
the
european
army
headquarters
in
france.
the
--
while
in
france,
the
petitioner
was
on
the
payroll
of
the
nashville
office
of
the
district
engineers.
he
was
paid
from
civil
works
funds.
he
furnished
his
own
housing,
food,
medical
care
and
transportation
both
for
himself
and
his
wife.
now,
prior
to
entering
a
plea
to
the
general
issue
in
the
court-martial
proceeding,
the
petitioner
challenged
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
both
as
to
his
person
and
as
to
the
offense
charged
on
the
ground
that
jurisdiction
of
both
this
person
and
the
offense
remained
with
the
french
and
now,
after
six
years
of
confinement
in
the
penitentiary,
that
is
still
this
petitioner's
contention.
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
well,
if
the
court
please,
a
good
portion
of
that
time
of
course
--
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
he
was
sentenced
in
march
of
1953.
the
court-martial
occurred
march
28th
to
march
27th.
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
pardon?
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
well,
a
good
portion
of
the
time
was
used
up
in
exhausting
his
administrative
remedies
under
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
his
appeal
to
the
--
to
higher
authority
and
to
the
court
of
military
field
and
so
on.
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
i
can't
tell
you
the
exact
data.
it
was
approved,
however,
but
he
of
course
didn't
bring
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
until
the
second
covert
decision
was
handed
down
by
this
court
and
then
i
talked
to
him
at
the
penitentiary
and
he
did
file
his
petition.
now,
the
petition
was
actually
filed
october
26th,
1957.
and
the
opinion
was
filed
by
the
district
court
on
april
22nd,
1958,
the
opinion,
it
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals,
october
24,
1958
and
the
opinion
was
handed
down
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
november
20.
so,
as
far
as
the
judicial
procedure
since
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
filed,
it
has
been
fairly
prompt.
now,
both
in
the
court,
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
have
argued
that
this
case
cannot
be
distinguished
from
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
the
covert
case,
the
second
decision
on
any
supportable
or
substantial
basis.
in
the
--
the
government's
argument,
this
is
supported,
i
should
say,
by
the
government's
argument
in
the
guagliardo
case
and
also
their
argument
in
the
supplementary
brief
which
they
filed
in
the
second
covert
case
in
which
they
--
they
specifically
stated
that
they
were
not
urging
--
they
did
not
feel
that
any
valid
distinction
could
be
made
between
civilian
dependents
and
civilian
employees
serving
with
the
armed
forces
or
accompanying
the
armed
forces
overseas.
i
think
that's
particularly
true
on
--
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
that's
very
true.
i
think
that
under
the
concurring
opinions
of
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
it's
particularly
difficult
to
distinguish
this
case
from
those
--
the
reasoning
of
those
opinions
because,
if
we're
going
to
balance
the
necessity
and
propriety
of
court-martial
jurisdiction
against
the
desirability
of
protecting
these
persons
under
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
and
giving
them
article
iii
trials,
it
seems
to
me
the
fact
that
this
petitioner
was
charged
with
a
capital
offense
where
the
issue
actually
was
one
of
life
or
death
should
have
considerable
weight
in
weighing
the
scales
in
his
favor
if
there
should
be
any
balancing
of
interest
in
the
matter.
so
far
as
the
decision
of
mr.
justice
or
the
reasoning
of
mr.
justice
black's
opinion,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it's
a
capital
offense
or
a
non-capital
offense.
and
i
don't
know
if
there
is
any
fact
here
on
which
these
decisions
can
be
distinguished
by
mr.
covert
decision
and
the
second
covert
decision
in
this
case.
however,
the
lower
courts
did
distinguish
them
and
the
court
of
appeals
gave
three
specific
--
or
gave
four
grounds
upon
which
the
distinction
was
allegedly
based.
one,
that
long
established
history,
tradition
and
practice
gave
the
military
authority
to
court-martial
civilians.
i
assume
in
time
of
peace
as
this
was.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
the
historical
background.
i
don't
have
the
background
material
to
do
what
colonel
wiener
has
i
think
done
an
excellent
and
thorough
job
in
that
connection.
i
do
want
to
make
this
one
observation.
however,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
framers
of
the
united
states
constitution
had
ever
thought
that
clause
14
was
to
be
used
to
extend
authority
to
the
military
to
court-martial
a
civilian
for
a
capital
offense
in
peacetime
in
a
friendly
foreign
country
that
there
certainly
would've
been
quite
an
argument
at
the
convention
and
we
would
find
some
reference
to
that
situation
in
the
various
source
materials
which
must
be
studied
in
order
to
understand
the
constitution
and
as
far
as
i
know,
there
are
none.
and
i
sincerely
feel
that
there
just
is
not
any
well-established
practice
permitting
the
trial
of
civilians
in
peacetime
by
military
court-martial.
now,
of
course
there
is
--
as
has
been
discussed
here
the
one
exception
which
is
based
on
the
war
powers,
in
time
of
war
and
in
the
field
in
the
face
of
actual
hostile,
the
military
operations
there
certainly
is
power
to
court-martial
civilians
under
the
laws
of
war.
at
least,
that
is
traditional,
but
here,
there
is
no
such
tradition.
secondly,
judge
goodrich
stressed
the
fact
of
necessity.
now
--
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
well,
of
course
the
article
2
(11)
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
purports
to
give
that
authority
to
if
it's
constitutionally
does
give
that
authority
to
the
military
in
time
of
war
and
peace
i
assume,
but
that's
the
question
at
issue
here
as
i
understand
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
essence,
the
government
is
arguing
in
these
cases
that
this
war
power,
this
right
to
try
civilians
in
the
field
in
the
face
of
actual
hostile
of
military
operations
which
has
some
historical
authenticity
and
background
that
that
should
be
extended.
in
other
words,
the
concept
within
the
field
should
be
extended
here
to
cover
peacetime
cases
where
there
is
actually
no
fighting.
the
only
justification
for
it
as
i
can
see
it
is
the
argument
that
it
is
necessary.
it's
one
--
because
of
the
so-called,
“cold
war”
and
the
necessities
of
the
situation
and
i
would
--
i
think
the
doctrine
is
false.
i
--
to
paraphrase
justice
davis
in
ex-parte
milligan,
it's
a
pernicious
doctrine
to
allow
any
exigency
or
necessity
to
warrant
a
cutting
down
of
rights
which
--
fundamental
rights
which
citizens
are
entitled
to
under
the
constitution,
in
other
words,
in
article
iii
trial
and
the
right
to
indictment
and
jury
trial
under
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
there
were
two
other
reasons
given
by
judge
goodrich.
one,
that
certain
fringe
benefits
were
extended
to
these
civilians
when
they
were
overseas
such
as
the
use
of
the
px
and
travel
allowances
and
things
of
that
kind.
well,
of
course,
both
mrs.
covert
and
mrs.
smith
in
the
second
covert
case
had
the
same,
if
not,
more
of
those
benefits.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
reference
to
--
he
stated
that
civilian
employee
goes
--
brought
of
his
own
volition.
well,
that's
equally
true
as
i
see
it
of
a
--
the
wife
of
an
officer
or
enlisted
man
in
the
armed
forces.
now,
we
send
--
our
position
as
simply
that
there
is
no
supportable
ground
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
second
covert
case
that
mrs.
smith,
mrs.
covert
and
grisham
were
all
citizens
of
the
united
states,
they
were
all
civilians,
they
were
all
three
charged
with
murder,
killing
their
respective
spouses,
they
were
all
tried
in
time
of
peace
in
a
friendly
foreign
country.
the
sole
and
only
factual
distinction
here
is
that
grisham
happened
to
be
a
civilian
account
and
he
was
accompanying
the
armed
forces
overseas
as
well
as
serving
with
them
and
employed
by
them
that
he
happened
to
be
a
civilian
accountant
and
mrs.
smith
and
mrs.
covert
happened
to
be
the
wives
of
military
personnel
and
it's
our
contention
that
that
is
simply
not
a
substantial
or
sufficient
factual
distinction
to
warrant
any
distinction
between
the
three
cases.
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
i
don't
think
any
logical
distinction
of
that
kind
could
be
drawn
although
if
we
are
going
to
say
that
this
is
analogous
to
a
due
process
case,
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
saying
in
the
covert
opinion
that
the
various
factors
had
to
be
balanced
as
you
would
in
the
due
process
case
and
it
might
make
a
difference,
yes,
it
seemed
to
me.
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
i
can't
answer
that
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
believe
so
but
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
assume
that
that's
possible,
but
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
that's
correct
and
that's
our
contention
--
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
there
is
one
other
thing
i
would
like
to
say
and
that
is
to
this
order
of
the
method
of
trial.
in
this
case,
as
i've
pointed
out
from
the
outset,
grisham
insisted
that
he
should
be
tried
by
the
french
civil
courts
and
i
see
no
reason
to
say
that
that
is
not
a
perfectly
little
acceptable
ultimate
method
of
trial.
there
is
a
crime,
it's
not
a
military
crime.
it's
murder
in
the
french
city
of
orleans,
not
on
the
military
base,
it
rose
out
of
a
purely
domestic
quarrel,
an
unfortunate
one.
but,
it
certainly
seems
that
it
would
be
proper
and
appropriate
to
try
that
case
whether
to
allow
the
france
to
have
jurisdiction
to
try
that
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
french
held
grisham
as
i've
pointed
out
in
the
7th
until
the
23rd
of
december
and
when
they
turned
him
over
they
did
so
reluctantly
and
said
that
they
did
in
its
substance
if
they
did
not
want
this
to
constitute
any
precedent
in
other
cases.
furthermore,
the
government's
argument
in
the
singleton
case
that
in
the
few
capital
cases
involving
defendants
that
it
would
not
be
unreasonable
to
insist
on
an
article
iii
trial
in
this
country
which
seem
to
apply
equally
well
here.
of
course,
i
just
pointed
out
there,
congress
hasn't
seen
fit
to
(inaudible)
substantive
offense
here
is
simply
it's
an
offense
against
the
united
states
at
all.
it's
only
made
so
by
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
they
are
turning
over
our
request
and
as
i
say
reluctantly
and
with
the
specific
provision
that
is
not
the
constituted
precedence.
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
well,
except
in
the
field
and
in
time
of
war.
mr.
charles
wolfe
kalp
