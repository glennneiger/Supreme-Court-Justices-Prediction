so
far
as
constitutional
power
is
concerned,
you
draw
a
distinction
between
employees
outside
of
the
united
states
and
employees
inside
the
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
distinction
do
you
draw
constitutionally
speaking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
statute
are
you
referring
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
--
i
understand
you
don't
have
to
at
this
juncture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
so
sure
about
the
next
juncture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
some
of
us
--
some
us
might
think
that
the
jurisdiction
is
a
jurisdiction
and
that
you
can't
decide
it
on
the
basis
or
the
exact
kind
of
relationship
that
something
is
happening
this
time
and
hundred
years
ago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
between
the
--
between
the
treaty
of
paris
which
ended
the
revolution
in
1787
or
1789,
did
the
continental
congress
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
the
new
states
or
any
of
them
deal
with
this
problem?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
in
the
field?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
the
king
of
great
britain
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
some
controversy
of
that
the
act
over
here,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
there
were
some
complaints
as
they
were
trying
the
people
and
deny
them
of
the
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
under
that
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
find
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
act
in
which
they
were
making
an
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
under
a
particular
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
did
congress
provide
they
should
be
tried
if
they
were
outside
of
the
place?
why
would
judicature
provision
required
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
year
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
law
now
about
it?
can
they
not
be
brought
anyway
into
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
you're
talking
about
aboard
naval
vessel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
tried
to
get
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
what
many
people
think.
you're
making
an
argument
here
that
you
--
you
have
no
assurance
that
the
countries
would
let
you
bring
them
over
here
to
trail,
it
would
demand
at
the
time
that
for
military
tribunal.
what's
that
based
on,
so
far
if
it
goes
beyond
the
fact
if
you
have
no
assurance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
because
those
employees
are
not
members
of
the
land
and
naval
forces,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
dependent
upon
whether
they
are
capital
crimes
or
not
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wasn't
talking
about
that,
i'm
talking
about
the
constitutional
distinction
with
reference
to
the
members
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
is
constitutional
balance?
what
have
you
done
anything
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
-
this
has
been
made
to
that
effect
prior
to
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
draw
a
constitutional
difference
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
the
due
process
clause
limits
or
quantifies
(inaudible).
do
you
think
that
the
due
process
clause
is
limiting
thing?
does
it
(inaudible)
the
right
to
trial
by
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
really
asked
about
this
because
i
was
curious
to
know
in
your
brief
do
you
assign
any
reference
to
that
distinction
in
this
field
before
the
covert.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
been
--
your
number
of
reading
of
that
phrase
isn't
just
word,
it's
a
sweep
of
this
committee,
that's
your
problem?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
read
the
history
of
it
there
were
rights
that
we
look
at
it,
i
thought
that
the
number
of
the
states
and
i
am
convinced
here
that
there
would
be
too
much
power
exercised
by
congress
and
certain
people
that
they
thought
so
specifically
because
it's
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
might
be
use
to
accomplish
that
reference.
i
thought
that
mr.
madison
referred
to
that
in
connection
with
his
(inaudible)
of
the
bill
of
rights
in
his
discussion
of
the
bill
of
rights.
it
was
to
come
this
case
and
to
put
these
things
beyond
the
reach
of
congress
that
the
particular
provision
of
the
bill
of
right
were
adopted
specifically
referring
to
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood,
mr.
wiener
â€“
colonel
wiener's
if
we
go
a
little
further
than
that.
it
was
--
as
i
understood
it
if
that
is
wrong,
that
you
couldn't
draw
on
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
to
take
away
from
the
--
to
add
any
power
to
congress
contrary
to
the
expressed
provision
that
were
provided
in
the
bill
of
rights
which
were
introduced
later.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
fact
--
that's
the
fact
that's
the
point
if
you're
correct
on
that,
of
course
if
they
fall
within
the
land
and
naval
forces,
then,
that
argument
would
have
no
relevance.
