you
haven't
showed
me
yet
why
we
can
decide
as
the
dissent
here
without

justice

that
question

that
question
should
be
decided

the

to
put
the
standard
or
court
for
instance,
to
charge
a

justice

that's
you're

justice

what

i
won't

--
but
would
you
transfer
something
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
your
advantage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
a
pretty
strong
presumption
if
you're
using
it
in
this
case,
i
should
think
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
would
think
it
be
pretty
bad
to
--
through
there's
a
breach
of
trust
for
a
church,
which
is
like
services
of
somebody
for
a
long
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
give
him
some
money
after
they
severed
their
relationship,
i

i
would
think
it
could
tell
a
hard
time
drawing
the
presumption
that
there
is
breach
of
trust
to
something
invidious
or
something.
justice
hugo
l.

but
it
could
--
we
couldn't
draw
a
rule,
could
we
that

i
do
not
know
what
should
be
done
--
i'm
just
asking
questions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
couldn't
--
we
couldn't
provide
the
rules
that
merely
said
that
every
time
a
person
--
seven
years
relationship
with
an
employer
and
the
employer
later
chose
to
transfer
some
money
to
him
if
that
was
compensation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
on
that
--
justice
hugo

so
far
as
the
public
is
concerned,
he
could,
i
suppose,
unless
somebody
connected
with
the
corporation
is
after
him.
justice

approved

that
might
be
difficult.
justice

do
that
very
easily,
could
they?
