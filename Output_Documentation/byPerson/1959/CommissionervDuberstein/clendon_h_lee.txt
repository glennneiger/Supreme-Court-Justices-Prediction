mr.
clendon
h.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
might
be
responsive
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
comment
yesterday
as
to
stockholder
approval.
to
state,
in
this
case
director,
vestry
and
churchwardens
of
trinity
church
are
constituted
the
corporation
under
their
charter
from
queen
anne.
and
that
therefore,
in
this
case,
we
do
have
the
effect
of
stockholder
approval.
the
actual
body
corporate
approved
it
insofar
as
that
is
legally
possible.
i
think,
we
might
begin
by
referring
to
the
fact
that
on
this
appeal,
this
certiorari
--
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
no
further
approval
by
any
person
was
legally
conceivable
or
possibly,
your
honor,
under
the
--
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
--
charter.
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
but
in
this
case,
the
corporation
exercised
its
power
to
the
fullest
in
view
of
the
fact
the
director,
vestry
and
church
wardens
are
the
very
ones
who
made
the
gift
and
no
further
approval
was
legally
conceivable
or
possible.
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
well,
the
government
did
not
raise,
at
any
point,
the
issue
of
corporate
capacity.
now,
if
they
were
to
raise
that
point
either
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
8
or
federal
rule
9,
then
they
would
be
in
a
position
to
raise
that
point
here.
the
manner
in
which
they've
raised
it,
they're
asking
this
court
to
create
a
nationwide
body
of
corporate
incapacity
in
complete
violation
and
in
complete
conflict
with
the
erie
railroad
against
tompkins,
they're
asking
this
court
without
having
the
charter,
the
colonial
charter
of
trinity
church
here,
on
appeal
on
certiorari.
they're
asking
this
court,
in
effect,
to
do
away
with
the
dartmouth
college
case
when
trinity
church
is
not
a
party
to
this
proceeding.
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
the
government
could
have
raised
that
point,
your
honor.
and
the
government
stipulated
on
trial
in
the
reply
brief
that's
referred
to
on
record
pages
18
and
page
60.
the
government
stipulated
that
the
only
question
involved
was
the
question
of
the
nature
of
the
payment
to
mr.
stanton.
now,
here,
they
have
purported
to
raise
a
question
of
corporate
capacity
and
they
have
done
that
not
through
the
familiar
process
of
stating
that
congress,
for
purposes
of
bankruptcy,
for
purposes
of
taxation,
for
so
many
purposes,
may
describe
the
legal
incidence
of
certain
transactions,
may
say
what
consequences
flow
for
the
purposes
of
federal
law.
they
have
said,
“instead,
we
must
go
back
and
find
an
inherent
corporate
incapacity
to
make
a
gift.”
and
they
have
done
so
by
citing
a
few
cases.
we
only
got
the
government's
brief
and
printer's
proof
form
of
78
pages
plus
30-page
appendix
on
last
friday.
and
i'm
afraid
i
haven't
been
able
to
deal
in
detail
with
all
their
points.but
they
cite
questions
like
rogers
again
hill.
hill
is
relating
to
eluding
the
corporation.
i
don't
think
they
have
any
bearing
on
this
point
at
all.
this
inveterate
principle
of
federal
corporation
law
apparently
wasn't
clear
to
the
government
just
a
few
weeks
before,
when
it
did
the
duberstein
brief
and
they're
asking
this
court
in
the
first
instance,
to
promulgate
this
federal
rule
of
corporate
incapacity
and
we
submit
that
it's
wholly
improper
for
that
question
to
be
here.
and
the
government
attempts
to
put
this
court
in
that
position
by
conceding
all
the
evidentiary
facts.
the
case
of
mr.
stanton
is
not
referred
to
in
the
government's
brief
until
page
77.
they
concede
the
evidentiary
fact.
they
expressly
concede,
on
page
77
of
their
brief
that
the
vestry
and
director
who
is
part
of
the
corporation
necessarily,
intended
to
make
a
gift.
and
i
think
they
must
necessarily
be
understood
as
also
conceding
that
the
majority
in
the
court
of
appeals
below
made
certain
patent
errors
in
reviewing
the
facts.
now,
one
of
those
particular
errors,
i
--
i
should
like
to
refer
to
at
some
length,
unless
this
court
perhaps,
not
perceive
it.
the
resolution
awarding
the
gratuity
to
stanton,
which
appears
on
page
4
of
the
main
brief
--
page
5
of
the
main
brief,
“be
it
resolved
that
in
appreciation
of
the
services
rendered
by
mr.
stanton
as
manager
of
the
estate
and
so
on.
a
gratuity
is
hereby
awarded
him
of
$20,000
and
so
on.”
and
then,
there's
a
proviso,
“provided
that
with
the
discontinuance
of
his
services,
the
corporation
of
trinity
church
is
released
from
all
rights
and
claims
to
pension
and
retirement
benefits,
not
already
accrued
up
to
november
30,
1942.”
mr.
stanton
resigned
on
november
5.
his
--
this
resolution
was
adopted
november
19.
the
effective
date
of
his
resignation
was
november
30.
under
this
resolution,
any
treatment
of
the
gift
to
him,
as
anything
other
than
a
gift,
was
precluded.
if
stanton
had
died,
his
legal
representatives
could
never
have
maintained
that
further
pension
rights
accrued
after
the
effective
date
of
his
resignation.
he
no
more
gave
up
anything
under
this
resolution,
than
he
gave
up
future
salary.
there
is
--
the
resolution
itself
is
really
the
--
the
copper
riveting,
so
far
as
the
vestry
was
concerned,
to
preclude
its
being
treated
for
corporate
purposes
or
by
legal
representatives
as
anything
other
than
a
gift.
now,
having
referred
to
that
one
particular
error
and
the
government
having
conceded
it
on
its
brief
in
this
court,
i
think
that
it
might
have
been
perhaps
preferable
if
they
had
joined
in
petitioner's
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
second
circuit
to
permit
the
second
circuit
to
correct
that
error.
and
then
consider
its
opinion
in
that
light,
rather
than
trying
to
precipitate
the
issue
in
this
court
with
the
duberstein
case
at
the
same
time.
now,
i
shan't,
at
this
point,
refer
to
the
clusters
of
evidentiary
facts
which
are
recited
on
pages
24
and
25.
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
the
factual
error
is
an
error
in
judge
hands'
opinion
where
he
stated
that,
“stanton
gave
something
up
under
this
proviso
which
would
presumably
be
some
variety
of
consideration.”
in
lieu
of
his
pension
rights,
he
got
this,
which
isn't
a
fact
at
all,
because
he
got
all
of
his
pension
rights.
and
it's
the
misreading
of
that
proviso
which
the
government
conceives,
i
believe,
under
its
brief
--
in
its
brief
in
this
case,
which
caused
that
unfortunate
mistake
in
the
second
circuit.
and
that's
why
i
say
that
would've
come
with
better
grace,
if
the
government
had
joined
in
our
petitioner
for
rehearing
in
the
second
circuit.
now,
the
fact
that
stand
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
it
is
completely
inconsequential,
your
honor.
and
if
it's
to
be
given
any
meaning
at
all,
it
reinforces
the
nature
of
this
as
an
outright
grant
without
consideration,
because
he
kept
everything
which
had
accrued
through
the
effective
date
of
his
resignation.
and
in
the
record,
page
34
in
the
record,
one
of
the
trustees
of
the
pension
fund
refers
to
his
voting
to
refund
the
money,
that
is
stanton's
own
contribution,
which
he
was
entitled
to
get.
on
page
51
of
the
record,
stanton
had
contributed
$1590
to
the
pension
plan
of
trinity
church
and
$594
to
the
pension
plan
of
trinity's
real
estate
subsidiary.
these
amounts
were
refunded
to
him
which
was
one
of
the
elections
which
he
could
take
under
the
pension
plan.
so
that
he
did
not
give
up
anything.
he
received
the
$20,000
gratuity
and
he
had
the
option
or
the
election
of
either
leaving
that
in
the
pension
plan
or
taking
a
cash
refund.
and
he
took
the
cash
refund.
and
it's
just
that
one
unfortunate
error,
which
i
want
--
wanted
to
refer
to
at
some
length
here,
before
going
into
the
cases.
the
government
relies
upon
this
court's
opinion
in
1956,
commissioner
against
lobue
or
lobue,
in
which
a
stock
option
plan
was
offered
to
employees
as
an
inducement,
as
an
incentive
to
keep
them
on
the
job,
to
promote
the
business
of
the
employer.
now
--
so
the
government
says,
“this
substitutes
motive
for
intent.”
and
bearing
in
mind
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
remarks
yesterday
on
the
unfortunate
necessity
of
dealing
with
states
of
mind,
i
should
like,
if
i
may,
to
refer
specifically
and
perhaps
pedantically
to
the
lobue
case.
this
court
unanimously,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
black,
and
i've
quoted
this
on
page
7
of
petitioner's
reply
brief,
stated,
“but
there's
not
the
slightest
indication
of
the
kind
of
detached
and
disinterested
generosity
which
might
evidence
a
gift
in
the
statutory
sense.”
these
transferors
of
stock
bore
none
of
the
earmarks
of
a
gift.
they
were
not
made
by
a
company
engaged
--
they
were
made
by
a
company
engaged
in
operating
a
business
for
profit.
and
the
tax
court
found
that
the
stock
option
plan
was
designed
to
achieve
more
profitable
operations
by
providing
the
employees
with
an
incentive
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
company
by
permitting
them
to
participate
in
its
success.
under
these
circumstances,
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
properly
refrained
from
treating
this
transfer
as
a
gift,
that
company
was
not
giving
away
something
for
nothing.
now,
in
the
stanton
case,
something
was
given
away
for
nothing.
there
was
no
past
consideration
because
he
got
$22,500
a
year,
salary.
his
successor
got
approximately
half
that.
so,
in
mr.
justice
brandeis'
language,
“past
services
had
fully
requited.”
no
further
acquittance
was
necessary.
there
was
no
future
consideration
because
he
did
nothing,
nor
did
he
refrained
from
doing
anything
in
the
future.
there
was
no
covenant
not
to
compete,
no
consultation.
it
was
not
a
substitute
for
the
pension
rights.
it
was
not
consideration
in
any
way.
now,
we
believe
that
the
key
to
intent
to
make
a
gift
lies
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
consideration.
this
is
the
traditional
element
of
a
gift,
an
absolute
grant
without
consideration.
without
consideration
is
the
realistic
test.
motive
can
never
be
a
realistic
test.
motive,
if
this
court
were
to
direct
the
lower
courts
to
pursue
motives,
we
would
have
the
sort
of
the
question
which
i
had
to
participate
in
several
years
ago
in
the
third
circuit,
where
the
government
revoked
retroactively,
the
tax-exempt
status
of
a
charity
on
the
ground
that
the
assets
of
that
charity
might
have
been
used
to
provide
a
source
of
raw
materials,
if
needed
by
the
donors
and
the
founders
of
that
charitable
foundation.
now,
judge
goodrich,
in
the
unanimous
court,
would
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
that
point
of
view.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
point
of
view
of
government
by
motive
has
very
much
to
commend
itself
to
this
court.
we'll
get
in
the
filed
of
--
of
constitutional
vagueness.
look
at
murder.
look
at
anything.
motive
arises
all
of
the
time,
but
sometimes
we
have
to
look
at
the
actual
events
and
that
aspect
of
the
event
which
involves
the
state
of
mind.
we
can't
escape
from
some
dealing
with
the
states
of
minds,
but
any
antecedent
motives,
any
states
of
mind,
which
a
person
might
have,
certainly
cannot
form
the
basis
for
directions
by
the
this
court
to
the
lower
courts.
it's
--
i
think,
also
of
importance
that
the
government
concedes
here
that
affection
is
not
the
sine
qua
non
of
a
gift.
the
government
expressly
states
that
affection
is
only
one
of
the
elements
which
might
be
taken
into
consideration.
and
they
refer
to
an
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
for
this
court
in
robertson,
where
a
person
gave
up
certain
public
performance
rights
to
a
musical
composition,
in
a
contest,
in
which
he
entered
and
he
received
a
prize
and
that
was
held
to
be
income.
and
this
court
differentiated
the
case
of
--
where
something
is
given
out
of
affection
and
certain
other
impulses
and
affection
was
one
of
the
examples.
now,
certainly,
good
emotions
certainly,
can't
be
the
criterion
of
a
gift.
wiley
oddyseus
to
priam
with
the
trojan
horse,
greeks
could
bear
gifts
without
having
affection
for
trojans.
and
i
think
that
we
--
we
must
restrict
ourselves
to
the
very
basic
concept,
the
traditional
property
and
contract
law
concepts
of
gift
and
whether
it
is
with
or
without
consideration.
now,
just
very
briefly,
reviewing
the
facts
with
respect
to
mr.
stanton,
so
if
the
court
will
have
it
in
mind
--
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
it
could
be
your
honor,
but
consideration
would
be
one
of
the
elements
which
a
trier
of
fact
should
take
into
--
into
--
bear
in
mind
in
determining
whether
it
was
an
absolute
gift
and
with
all
consideration,
is
one
of
the
most
significant
points.
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
yes.
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
perhaps
i
--
i
wasn't
at
all
fair
and
if
i
restate
what
i
think
i
should've
said
that
the
most
important
factor
in
evidencing
the
intent
to
make
a
gift
is
the
presence
or
absence
of
consideration.
and
that
is
something
which
the
trial
of
court,
listening
to
the
testimony
and
looking
at
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
this
grant
which
came
as
a
surprise
to
mr.
stanton
--
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
that's
one
of
the
things
which
the
trial
court
--
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
--
should
bear
in
mind
very
carefully
and,
in
this
case,
the
trial
judge
listened
to
it
and
decided
in
favor
of
mr.
stanton.
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
i
think
that's
--
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
no,
no
i
don't
--
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
no.i
--
i
think
--
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
i
think
--
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
yes.
i
--
i
see
your
point
and
i
--
i
think
your
honor's
point
is
quite
well
taken.
the
government,
in
its
brief,
i
--
i
believe,
tries
to
--
to
use
the
expression,
“bargained-for
exchange.”
i
don't
think
that
quite
is
the
point.
i
think
where
there's
no
anticipated
benefit,
no
incentive
and
in
mr.
justice
brandeis
expression
in
bogardus,
where
past
services
had
been
fully
requited,
i
--
i
think
there,
a
trier
of
fact
can
properly
find
a
gift.
now,
if
employment
has
been
the
occasion
for
knowing
someone,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
should
not
vitiate
a
gift.
now,
the
government
asks
here
that
corporations
be
completely,
absolutely,
from
the
beginning
of
the
republic
to
the
present
day,
be
disabled
from
making
a
gift.
and
that
faithful
stewards
and
old
retainers
be
disqualified
from
their
statutory
right
to
receive
it.
and
the
government
asks
for
definitions.
now,
congress
has
not
defined
the
gift.
the
government
appends
30
pages
of
cases.
the
facts
in
one
case
or
one
way,
the
decisions
in
other
way,
now,
if
there
are
questions
of
fact
in
the
system
of
jurisprudence,
there
are
going
to
be
differences
in
results
--
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
--
in
the
trial
courts.
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
i
think
in
that
case,
that
would
--
that
would
clearly
have
been
compensation,
your
honor.
i
think
if
the
person
is
capricious,
that's
one
of
the
facts
which
the
trial
court
would
take
into
--
into
mind.
and
i'm
sure
that
mr.
justice
brandeis
under
--
under
his
views
would
not
consider
$100
payment
for
a
corporate
opinion
to
the
full
acquittance.
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
there
was
disproportion
--
inherent
disproportion,
i
should
think,
between
the
value
of
the
services
--
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
--
and
what
discharge.
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
well,
i
think
that
the
--
the
caprice
of
some
particular
lawyer
would
be
something
which
the
trial
courts
should
properly
bear
in
mind,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
mr.
stanton
was
quite
--
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
undoubtedly
--
undoubtedly,
he
said
--
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
--
to
go
for
$100
and
he
couldn't
have
sued
for
more.
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
actual
facts
are
that
mr.
stanton
was
paid
$22,500
a
year
and
his
successor
received
$12,000
a
year.
so
that,
i
think
that
his
--
his
services
where
quite
adequately
requited.
now,
i
should
like,
if
i
may,
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
clendon
h.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
what
mr.
barnett
has
just
stated
that
he
has
put
ourselves
right
back
in
the
dartmouth
college
case
and
in
the
--
and
in
the
erie
railroad
against
tompkins,
because
he
says
that
it
is
only,
if
they
breached
their
trust
that
this
can
be
a
gift,
that
the
corporation
is
inherently
incapable
of
making
a
gift.
our
federal
rule
8
provides
that
affirmative
defenses
shall
be
pleaded.
there
was
no
affirmative
defense
below.
this
is
a
complete
afterthought.
it
was
an
afterthought
after
the
filling
to
duberstein
brief.
they
knew
that
they
couldn't
--
couldn't
support
the
--
they
--
they
couldn't
upset
the
fact
findings
of
the
trial
court
and
they
perfectly,
logically
and
the
brief
of
the
government
is,
i
think,
thoroughly
consistent
in
this
regard.
it
proceeds
and
says,
we
must
throw
away
property
and
contract
concepts.
we
must
look
at
the
corporation,
we
must
dehumanize
it.
it's
the
non-anthropomorphic
view
of
corporations.
that's
what
it
is.
we
dehumanize
it.
and
by
the
same
token,
a
corporation
cannot
commit
a
crime
including
tax
fraud,
we
strip
it
of
all
intent,
all
will,
all
emotional
coloration
and
we
say
that
that
has
been
the
law
since
the
beginning
of
the
republic.
a
corporation
is
inherently
incapable
--
incapable
of
making
a
gift.
now,
i
am
a
little
bit
perplexed
about
the
reference
to
deductibility
of
business
expenses.
i
can
appreciate
the
commissioner's
desire
and
the
solicitor
general's
desire
to
introduce
symmetry
into
the
statute,
but
that
is
purely
a
--
a
congressional
function.
the
internal
revenue
code
is
the
baroque
masterpiece
of
congress.
and
it
can't
be
redone
by
the
pseudo-classical
canons
of
criticism
of
the
commissioner
or
the
solicitor
general.
