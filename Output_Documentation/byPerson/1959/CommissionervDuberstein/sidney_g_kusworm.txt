mr.
sidney
g.
kusworm,
sr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
--
honorable
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
this
is
the
greatest
court
in
the
land.
while
we're
speaking
of
bogardus,
i
was
just
wondering
in
the
reading
of
the
briefs
in
these
three
cases
whether
they
are
not
--
they
were
written
by
the
same
distinguished
lawyer.
in
the
kaiser
case,
here's
what
the
government
said
about
bogardus.
while
it
maybe
possible
to
articulate
such
a
difference,
we
think
that
rather
an
attempt
now
to
rationalize
bogardus
in
new
terms,
it
ought
to
be
recognize
simply
that
it
reflected
and
approached
that
has
since
been
rejected
by
this
court
and
is
no
longer
of
value
as
present.
now
in
the
brief
in
the
stanton
case,
the
same
question
on
bogardus
is
answered
this
way.
the
bogardus
case
is
reconcilable
with
the
suggested
definition
of
gifts.
that
is
the
use
of
motive
for
the
determination
of
a
gift.
in
the
kaiser
brief,
the
solicitor
general
also
speaks
about
the
bogardus
case
in
a
different
way.
and
so
they
seem
to
be
some
confusion.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
while
mr.
elman
has
given
the
facts
in
this
case,
and
then
very
fair
there
are
one
or
two
things
that
he
hasn't
said
that
i
think
ought
to
be
said
in
order
to
clarify
the
situation.
duberstein
and
berman,
berman
was
the
head
of
mohawk
were
friends
and
as
mr.
rauh
said,
they
have
frequent
business
dealings
with
each
other
and
frequent
conversations
over
the
phone
and
they
were
very
friendly.
and
every
once
in
a
while,
berman
would
ask
duberstein
if
he
knew
of
somebody
that
handled
a
certain
product
that
duberstein
didn't
handle.
on
this
particular
day,
in
this
particular
instance,
berman
said
to
duberstein,
“do
you
know
of
anybody
who
might
be
interested
in
buying
so
and
so,”
mentioning
materials
and
duberstein
said,
“i
don't
know.
why
don't
you
try
so
and
so
and
so
and
so,
because
i
haven't
any
idea
whether
they
can
use
them
or
not.
now
that's
the
last
of
duberstein
heard
about.
until
months
and
months
later,
now
mind
you
duberstein
didn't
contact
any
of
these
people.
he
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
trying
to
see
what
(inaudible)
material.
he
didn't
talk
to
any
of
them.
he
didn't
write
any
of
them.
he
had
no
communication
with
any
of
them.
and
the
telephone
call
comes
from
berman
and
he
said,
“i
got
a
cadillac
car
and
i
want
to
give
you
as
a
gift.”
and
duberstein
said,
“i
don't
want
a
cadillac,
sir
i've
got
two
cars
[laughter].”
i
got
a
car
from
myself
a
cadillac
and
i've
got
a
car
for
my
wife
and
he
said,
“but
you
got
children.
you
could
always
use
the
car
and
i
want
you
to
take
the
car.”
so
he
took
the
car.
mr.
sidney
g.
kusworm,
sr.
did
he
what
your
honor?
mr.
sidney
g.
kusworm,
sr.
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
protest.
he
didn't
said
anything
and
he
didn't
protest.
mr.
sidney
g.
kusworm,
sr.
well
if
your
honor
pleases,
i'm
not
going
to
make
an
interpretation.
that's
the
business
of
this
very
distinguished
court.
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
that's
the
last
duberstein
heard
about
it
for
four
years
agent
comes
in
to
it.
mr.
sidney
g.
kusworm,
sr.
an
agent,
a
revenue
agent.
[laughter]
they
do
come,
your
honor
[laughter]
and
that
he
checks
duberstein,
“what
is
the
–
what
about
this
cadillac?
he
said,
“well
what
about
it,”
some
worm
out
now.
he
said,
“but
you
got
to
pay
a
tax
on
it.”
he
said,
“i
don't
have
a
play
a
tax
on
it.
this
was
a
gift.
i
didn't
render
this
fellow
any
service.
i
didn't
get
him
many
customers.
i
am
not
the
one
in
business.
i'm
not
a
stockholder.
i'm
not
a
director
of
this
company.”
just
as
your
honors
said,
you
practically
forced
the
thing
on
me,
i
didn't
need
it.
well
the
agent
said
mohawk
deducted
it.
when
he
said,
“why
didn't
you
go
after
mohawk?”
now
this
is
off
the
record
and
the
agent
said
the
statute
of
limitation
is
gone
by.
well
then
he
said,
“why
don't
you
after
berman?”
he
said,
“berman
is
dead.”
mr.
sidney
g.
kusworm,
sr.
i
was
going
to
say
it
that
he
don't
want
to
pay
it
but
that's
what
he
did
say.
now,
that's
this
case.
so
we
go
to
the
tax
court.
duberstein
is
the
only
witness
other
then
the
accountant
because
when
this
man
said,
the
agent
said,
“you
have
to
pay
a
tax
on
it”,
duberstein
called
up
his
colleagues
and
what
about
it”
and
he
said,
“i
don't
know
anything
about
it.
i
never
got
a
1099,
you
never
got
a
1099.”
that's
the
slip
that
the
government
sends
out
to
somebody
to
gets
over
$600.
and
he
said,
“why
don't
you
check
into
it?”
so
he
said,
“all
right
i
will.”
so
we
called
up
berman's
accountant
and
he
said,
“did
you
ever
send
me
a
1099?”
he
said,
“certainly,
i
send
everybody
and
i've
got
registered
receipts
for
them.”
well
he
said,
“we
got
a
registered
receipt
for
this
one?”
he
said,
“let
me
look”
and
he
looks
and
he
said,
“no
i
haven't
gotten
it.”
it's
the
only
one
i
haven't
got.
well
he
said
he
didn't
get
any
1099
from
you
or
anybody
else.
he
said
“how
does
it
come”
that
duberstein
is
being
charged
with
it,
he
said,
“i
don't
know.”
but
he
said,
“i'll
tell
you
what
happened.
i
called
berman's
attention
to
this
item
the
$4250
for
a
cadillac
and
i
said,
“you
have
to
pay
the
tax
on
it.”
and
he
said,
“i
don't
want
to
pay
a
tax
on
it.
how
can
get
out
of
paying
a
tax
on
it?”
he
said,
“but
what
happened?”
well
we
said,
“i
called
duberstein
up
on
the
telephone
and
i
asked
him
to
give
me
the
names
of
some
people
that
might
be
interested
and
he
told
me.
so
the
accountant
said,
“well,
if
you
want
to
(inaudible).
he
said,
“all
right
that
just
we'll
do.
we'll
call
the
(inaudible)”
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
to
last
this
case.
now
i
say
to
your
honor
--
mr.
sidney
g.
kusworm,
sr.
berman
made
the
gift
as
far
as
duberstein
was
concerned,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
g.
kusworm,
sr.
i
mean
i
thought
he
knew
about
it.
berman
was
the
president
of
mohawk
and
berman
asked
him
about
certain
materials
that
mohawk
was
selling.
but
when
your
honor
as
who
made
the
gift,
i
might
answer
by
saying
to
your
honor
that
i'd
like
to
know
the
reason
that
the
solicitor
general
says
that
intent
is
not
the
rule,
but
motive
is
the
rule.
in
other
words,
it's
a
question
of
“why”
not
“what.”
now
--
mr.
sidney
g.
kusworm,
sr.
as
far
as
we
know,
mr.
justice
stewart,
your
honor,
it
was
on
mohawk
books
but
of
course
that's
only
because
the
revenue
agent
told
us
that.
mr.
sidney
g.
kusworm,
sr.
we
had
no
knowledge
at
all
on
whose
books
it
was
or
if
it
was
on
anybody's
books.
now
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
is,
if
i
may,
that
this
is
not
a
matter
for
this
court
to
determine,
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
congress
to
determine.
and
i
think,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black
made
the
suggestions
when
the
government
was
arguing
this
case.
in
other
words,
a
corporation
can
make
a
gift.
for
15
years
we've
been
going
by
the
usual
and
accepted
way
of
doing
businesses
as
far
as
gifts
were
concerned.
now,
if
there
is
to
be
a
clarification
and
the
gift
is
to
be
by
motive
and
not
by
intent
then
it's
for
the
congress
to
say,
and
not
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
just
as
in
(inaudible)
cases,
where
people
who
were
giving
gifts
for
answering
questions
on
the
television
and
weren't
paying
taxes
on
them,
they
didn't
come
to
the
supreme
court.
they
went
to
the
congress
and
the
congress
passed
section
74,
which
cured
that
situation
and
which
made
all
of
these
gifts
taxable.
and
that's
what
ought
to
be
done
in
this
case
if
there's
any
question
of
the
solicitor
general
wanting
motive
taken
for
intent
and
wanting
clarifications
and
all
that
sort
of
things.
this
section
is
very
clear.
this
section
doesn't
need
clarification.
it
needs
addition
of
the
things
that
they
want
should
be
there.
and
exclusions
from
gross
income
include
gifts,
requests,
and
devices,
the
value
of
the
property
acquired
by
gift
request,
devise
or
inheritance
etc.
now,
that's
very
plain.
now
if
there's
to
be
an
enlargement
of
that,
then
it
is
for
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
say
and
not
for
the
supreme
court.
now,
getting
back,
i
had
all
of
these
various
distinctions
that
i
was
going
to
make
in
the
various
cases
that
have
been
cited
but
i
am
not
going
to
do
that.
i'm
just
going
to
include
by
saying
what
was
said
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
and
that
was,
if
i
may
take
for
the
moment
please,
i'm
sorry
but
on
the
blue
prints
of
my
argument
i
lost
the
place.
we
have
repeatedly
held
that
the
taxpayer
has
made
out
his
case
when
he
has
put
in
proofs
clearly
and
distinctly
tending
to
show
determinating
facts.
the
presumption
of
the
commissioner
is
right
and
it's
procedural
and
cannot
survive
such
proofs
unless
they
are
challenged
by
contrary
proofs
or
destructive
analysis.
and
we've
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
taxpayers'
affirmative
evidence
made
itself
contain
the
necessary
challenge
and
furnish
the
material
for
such
analysis.
we
find
that
the
taxpayers'
evidence
clearly
and
distinctly
offered
proof
that
the
cadillac
car
was
in
fact
a
gift.
it
was
not
challenged
by
contrary
proofs
or
destructive
analysis.
it
maybe
contended
that
in
such
a
case
as
this,
we
should
add
suspicion
into
presumption
of
correctness
to
aid
the
commissioner's
assessment
of
the
deficiency.
this
we
cannot
do.
this
matter
should
be
decided
on
evidence.
in
the
case
of
landsberg
versus
the
commissioner
--
versus
the
commissioner
supra,
judge
simon's
characterized
such
attitude
as
follows
that
most
the
board's
finding
rest
upon
mere
suspicion
upon
an
inference
and
generosity
of
the
kind
here
involved
is
so
rare
that
it
must
necessarily
from
that
fact
alone
be
suspected.
we
hold
that
the
taxpayer
met
his
burden
of
proof
that
the
cadillac
was
a
gift
and
the
decision
of
the
tax
court
is
accordingly
reversed.
thank
you
very
much.
