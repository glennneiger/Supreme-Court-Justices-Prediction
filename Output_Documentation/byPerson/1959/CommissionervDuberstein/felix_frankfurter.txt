justice

frankfurter
mr.
elman,
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
--
what
would
please
you
if
it
came
out
of
this
court
because
this
case
--
that
this
court
would
formulate
to
the
guidance
for
the
treasury
people
who
i'm
sure
with
conscience
would
decide
as
follows
that
would
improve
upon,
add
to
or
subtract
(inaudible)
bares
all
the
inference
of
mr.
justice
cardozo's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
even
this
is
one
of
those
situations
in
the
law
doesn't
(inaudible)
in
which
it
is
important
to
negative
rather
than
to
strike
to
hit
upon
a
magnitude
failed
operating
of
the
formula,
this
court
would
effectively
clear
out
a
lot
of
rubbish
--
a
rubbish
and
by
rubbish
i
mean
irrelevancy
which
affects
the
mind
from
the
real
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
think
of
any
limitation
and
the
dissent
in
bogardus,
it
seems
to
me
so
they
were
made
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
he
gets
down
to
talking
about,
has
it
been
made
with
the
intention
of
services
whether
the
part
should
be
required
more
completely
though
full
equipment
have
been
given
if
so
if
there's
a
tax.
has
it
been
made
to
show
good
will
and
esteem
of
kindliness
to
other
persons
who
have
to
do
is
serve
whether
to
obtain
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
--
if
this
court
cleans
out
as
it
were,
then
the
application
of
these
inevitably
partly
subjective
sense
they're
inevitably
partly
subjective,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
individual
case
ought
not
to
be
brought
here
and
we
ought
not
to
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
some
of
the
matters
and
that
intent
and
intention
in
almost
every
branch
of
the
law
either
confusing
instead
of
an
aluminating
thing
in
order
to
retire.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
--
well
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
spent
20
years
--
25
years
speaking
and
i
solemnly
sworn
never
to
use
it
and
if
i
did,
it
was
non-conscious
betrayal
of
my
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
judges
having
been
more
--
they
don't
have
the
other
things
making
fun
of
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
have
to
use
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
don't
we
have
to
use
it
because
you
use
it
[laughter].
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
--
that
was
an
enforced
gift,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
consideration,
i
take
it,
you
don't
mean
the
requirement
of
the
contract
where
a
consideration
is
required
that
you
mean
a
--
a
total
absence
of
any
--
of
any
moving
cause
except
benefaction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
by
benefaction
i
would
--
maybe
that's
a
bad
word.
i
include
believing
people
of
--
of
stressing
etcetera.
but
you
don't
mean
an
enforceable
consideration
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
something
that's
said
because
of
the
--
because
of
the
presence
of
consideration
in
the
contract,
you
don't
mean
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
some
--
some
earthy
--
who
then
showed
practical
reasons
other
than
benevolence
or
gratuity,
otherwise,
the
two
were
troublesome.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
substrate
is
even
completely
requited.
there
comes
to
my
mind
since
they
speak
of
--
of
patients
sending
the
doctor
--
it's
a
bigger
return
in
the
--
and
the
fee
calls
for.
it
comes
to
my
mind
that
capricious
conduct,
the
one
of
greatest
lawyers
in
the
history
of
the
american
bar,
john
g.
johnson.
he
was
very
capricious
in
the
fiends
that
he
charged
crimes.
and
i
happen
to
know
of
a
case
where
he
sent
in
because
he
--
a
bill
of
--
for
$100.
and
my
friend
was
an
officer
of
the
corporation
to
whom
he
gave
an
opinion.
they
send
him
--
the
back
of
the
$100
and
on
reflection,
they
though
this
is
silly.
now,
they
--
he
was
wholly
requited.
john
g.
johnson
was
fully
required
for
that
$100
settlement.
but
the
next
day,
they
send
them
a
check
for
$5000.
now,
would
that
have
been
a
gift?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
and
so
--
not
another
penny
could've
been
sued
for
or
--
or
a
less
imaginative
corporate
officer
or
corporation
might
have
said,
“well
if
that's
all
john
g.
johnson,
if
he
had
fun
out
of
this
case,
or
he
--
if
he's
glad
to
render
that
opinion
and
show
up
some
piece
of
the
legislation
at
this
concern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
may
not
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
sending
jpmorgan
a
bill
for
$1
million,
just
to
make
up
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
merely
talking
to
myself
to
the
phrase,
legally
requited
now,
i
think
john
g.
johnson,
my
instance
was
legally
requited
when
that
$100
check
reached
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
the
problem
was
one
of
terminology
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
confusion
in
dealing
with
the
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
judge
(inaudible)
reveal
what
he
was
looking
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
word
“gift”
--
isn't
the
word
“gift”
on
the
latter's
argument
--
four
letters
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
four-lettered
word
--
that
dubious
four-lettered
word,
dubious
in
a
certain
sense,
really
the
--
the
summary
of
a
profit
by
which
a
judgment
is
reached,
rather
than
the
litmus
paper
by
which
we
can
deal
any
judge,
at
least
the
judge
can
determine
what
he's
suppose
to
find.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
after
saying
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
kind
of
a
problem,
would
that
fear
you
have
to
be
met.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
bogardus
(inaudible)
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
barnett,
i
want
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
about
bogardus?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
assumption
that
bogardus
had
been
the
mischief
maker
in
this
whole
scene.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
no
bogardus
decision--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
lower
courts
couldn't
refer
to
some
kind
of
a
supreme
court
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
followed
the
advice
of
mr.
--
or
the
suggestion
of
mr.
elman
tendered
and
if
one
read
judge
hand's
opinion
below,
which
i
have
done
and
not
only
where
in
his
opinion,
but
i
read
judge
swan's
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case.
and
i
agree
with
--
i
don't
know
that
heart
of
the
number
of
times,
the
opinions
in
this
court.
the
bogardus
opinion
in
this
court
is
a
--
is
pie
with
many
plums
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
it.
what
i
get
out
of
the
opinions
of
the
lower
court,
the
need
of
this
court.
it
is
the
different
plum
that
picks
by
different
people
in
different
cases,
for
different
purpose.
and
i
should
--
i
now
understand
why
the
government
doesn't
ask
as
to
overrule
bogardus,
if
you
were
to
ask
me
to
do
that,
i
wouldn't
know
what
i
was
overruling,
except
one
thing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely,
that
in
view
of
the
fining
of
the
commissioner
as
sustained
by
the
board
of
tax
appeal,
the
court,
the
district
court,
none
of
the
courts
should
have
overruled
those
joint
findings.
and,
i
think,
the
numbers
of
case,
i
said
what
i
think
about
it.
for
me,
i
think
your
chasing
the
wrong
hare
in
all
its
business.
because
mr.
justice
sutherland,
as
tow
whom
i
have
great
respect,
had
affection
as
a
man.
in
this
case
and
so
of
with
his
opinions,
talked
to
much.
indeed,
i
think,
almost
all
the
judges
in
this
field
talk
too
much.
because
he
didn't
restrict
himself
to
moral
and
legal
duty,
except
something
else
which
is
very
pertinent.
all
of
the
incentive
and
--
of
anticipated
benefit
of
any
kind
beyond
the
satisfactory
close
from
the
performance
of
a
generous
act.
i
ask
you,
could
you
let
lose
a
more
confusing
and
diverting
set
of
words
than
those?
how
can
any
judge
or
any
jury,
any
court,
at
least,
if
the
jury
has
found
it,
decide
whether
or
not,
something
that
was
given,
was
given
as
an
incentive
of
anticipated
benefit
of
any
kind
beyond
the
satisfaction.
parents
give
gifts
to
children
or
friend
give
gifts
to
friends
and
who
is
to
pursue
the
complexity
of
motive
that
entered.
now,
then,
i
think
the
bogardus
case
really
--
the
lower
court
is
a
clash
between
the
view
of
judge
hand,
who
said
that
the
determinations
of
fact
and
practically
final
from
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
judge
swan
said,
since
the
facts
were
stipulated,
i
can
pass
on
them,
as
well
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
lower
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
it
got
down
to
the
question
which
as
i
understand
it,
justice
douglas
largely
stood,
namely,
i
can
--
seeking
the
square
to
circle
by
asking
or
trying
to
give
any
better
word
that
will
do
the
trick.
it
will
be
a
litmus
state
and
avoid
the
kind
of
conflicting
decisions
on
the
same
accepted
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
he
--
that
was
a
question
and
he
said
it.
yes,
he
did
say
that
the
question
of
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
he
was
bound
by
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
he
didn't
disagree
much
with
--
with
judge
swan
and
looked
and
looked
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
--
look
what
the
question
of
fact
was,
i
don't
know
with
all
my
sympathy
with
the
dissent
in
bogardus,
whether
a
part
from
the
fact
that
i
would
be
bound
by
the
two
law
of
fact
finding
tribunal,
you
could
find
differently
when
it
was
stipulated,
it
was
stipulated.
think
of
lawyers
stipulating
this
kind
of
thing.
it
was
stipulated
that
the
disbursements
were
not
made
or
intended
to
be
made
for
any
services
rendered
or
to
be
rendered,
or
for
any
consideration
given
or
to
be
given
etcetera,
etcetera.
think
of
a
stipulation
like
that,
no
wonder
you
got
the
kind
mess
the
bogardus
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
and
has
generated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
--
that's
what
i
think
about
the
bogardus
case
and
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
now
i
understand
whether
you
know
that
is
to
overrule
them.
that's
that
we
don't
know
what
to
overrule
out
of
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
you've
formed
your
own
words
and
i
can
assure
you
i
make
a
profit
on
this,
that
upon
those
words
that
will
be
dealt,
the
losses
by
lower
court
and
by
this
court
that
in
10
years
from
now,
we'll
get
to
just
where
bogardus
had
come.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
suggest
you
--
what
we
can
do
is
to
do
a
lot
of
negatives,
say
a
lot
of
things
cannot
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
give
a
test
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
certainly
not
the
exclusive
test.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
you'll
search
for
an
affirmative
guiding
characterization
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
the
judges
and
commissioners
and
anybody
else
including
ourselves
was
stray
is,
i
suggest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
squaring
the
circle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
not
here
to
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we're
here
to
decide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
the
less
we
talk,
the
better.
it's
my
view.
