justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice

tax
court
used
the
standard
of
intention
and
followed
your
way
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
under
--
under
your
test,
all
we
have
to
it
seems
to
this
corporation
making
the
so-called
gift
as
it
was,
it
couldn't
be
a
gift
unless
perhaps
all
the
stockholders
agreed
to
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
the
quote
directors
couldn't
act
for
the
corporation
out
of
the
feeling
of
their
charity
to
superannuated
employee.
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
did
the
--
so
the
--
with
this
case
is
somewhat
a
difficulty
that
i
expressed
in
the
first
case
you
argued
and
that
is
that
the
discussion
seems
to
me
to
be
in
very
large
degree
off
in
the
abstract
world,
like
an
academic
discussion
in
classroom.
here,
you
have
a
--
here,
you
have
a
district
court
looking
at
all
these
conflicting
inferences
and
saying
this
is
a
gift
within
the
meaning
of
the
revenue
act,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
you
have
a
court
of
appeals
--
by
divided
vote
reversing
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
if
you
have
the
district
court
looking
at
all
of
these
conflicting
inferences
and
saying,
this
is
not
a
gift
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirming
him,
then
i
could
understand
your
--
your
argument.
but
--
but
where
are
you
going
to
--
why
are
you
going
to
leave?
how
are
you
going
to
resolve
all
these
conflicting
inferences
--
i
--
because
that
obviously,
you
can
make
this
either
a
--
a
gift
or
not,
depending
upon
your
premature
starting
point,
i
would
think.
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
the
--
the
weight
you
give
to
various
statements
or
facts
and
so
on.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
have
this
question
of
bogardus,
it
hasn't
been
overruled,
has
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
notice
that
both
the
majority
and
the
minority
in
bogardus
used
the
question
of
the
test
of
intent.
so
that
must
--
that
both
opinions
must
displease
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
i'm
sure
the
government
didn't
find
the
charge
in
the
first
case
that
was
argued
yesterday,
error,
as
i
have
recalled.
