mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
having
vigorously
argued
yesterday,
the
strike
benefits
are
taxable.
i
would
like
today,
to
seek
more
hospitable
ground
by
disassociating
myself
from
that
argument.
in
our
view,
with
the
main
controlling
issue
in
kaiser
case
was
really
not
the
“gift”
issue
at
all,
but
--
but
the
income
issue.
whether
relief
payments
regardless
of
the
interest
that
they
pay
or
--
or
the
kind
of
thing
that
congressman
taft
and
it's
included
in
the
definition
of
income.
now,
that
problem
is
not
involved
in
duberstein
and
stanton
at
all.
we
are
here
concerned
solely
with
this
specific
purposes
and
policy
of
the
gift
exclusion.
what
is
a
gift?
now,
the
extinction
between
gifts
--
the
gift
problem
and
the
income
problem
as
mr.
elman
pointed
out,
also
distinguishes
the
problem
here,
the
problem
on
the
pot
o'
gold
and
the
other
advertising
giveaway
cases,
which
--
though
they
stated
the
results
in
terms
of
gift,
really
turned
on
the
considerations
that
go
into
the
income
question.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
first
case,
the
pot
o'
gold
case,
itself,
is
evident
in
the
opinion,
that
they're
talking
about
eisner
and
macomber,
that
the
receipt
was
received
without
any
investment
of
capital,
without
any
effort.
and
therefore,
in
the
eisner
and
macomber
idea
of
income,
it
was
not
income.
and
we
think
that
really
was
the
basis
for
those
decisions
and
they
likewise
did
not
involve
the
gift
issue.
now,
is
this
case
that
poses
the
gift
issue
in
its
most
basic
and
most
litigated
form,
payments
to
employees
to
their
families?
there'd
been
perhaps,
over
100
decisions
in
the
area
and
still
there's
no
clear
line
for
what
is
and
what
isn't
a
gift.
this
case
sharply
presents
the
issue
of
the
--
mr.
stanton
worked
for
the
church
for
10
years.
the
church
gave
mr.
stanton
$20,000.
now,
the
problem
in
resolving
that
is
primarily
a
problem
of
terminology,
we
think.
that's
the
reason
for
the
--
the
troubles
the
courts
have
had
--
have
had.
now,
here
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
was
the
problem
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
now,
that's
illustrated
here
by
the
argument
that
the
question
is
one
of
consideration.
now,
is
--
the
service
has
existed
and
the
payment
existed.
and
the
problem
is
to
tie
them
together.
how
do
you
decide
whether
one
is
for
the
other?
and
you
can't
answer
that
by
saying
it
--
it
is
or
is
not
a
consideration.
they
just
begs
the
question.
the
courts
in
trying
to
make
--
to
make
the
connecting
tie
between
the
one
and
the
other
have
generally
phrased
the
question
as
whether
the
payor
intended
to
pay
for
the
services.
now,
the
problem
in
this
--
what
they
meant
by
intent.
now,
used
--
in
a
technical
sense
are
precisely
used.
intent,
we
think,
is
an
act
of
will.
it's
--
it
necessarily
implies
power
of
choice.
i
can
intend
whatever
i
want
to
intend.
now,
if
the
courts
mean
intent
in
that
sense,
it
necessarily
means
that
the
question
turns
on
what
the
payor
will.
he
can
will
the
payment
to
be
a
gift
or
will
it
to
be
compensation.
and
its
--
one
thing
is
clear,
that's
not
what
the
courts
mean.
they
don't
--
they
don't
mean
that
the
payor
can
specify
whether
it's
going
to
be
a
gift
or
compensation.
what
we
think
they
mean,
if
you
look
to
what
government's
decisions,
rather
than
the
language,
is
what
moved
the
payor
to
make
the
payment?
why
did
he
make
the
payment?
and
that
relieves
all
we
mean
by
motive
to
distinguish
motive
from
intent.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
--
we
think,
the
problem
really
isn't
one
of
evidence.
and
it
isn't
one
of
inferences
drawn
from
evidence
so
much
as
it
is,
what
kind
of
fact
you're
looking
for.
now,
what
it
is
you
--
you
hope
to
find,
when
you
look
at
the
evidence?
and
the
problem
--
that
has
never
been
spelled
out.and
what
we
hope
to
do
with
these
cases
is
just
to
try
to
get
an
articulation
of
what
it
is
that
the
trial
judge
is
supposed
to
look
for.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
sir.
just
one
finding,
the
payment
was
a
gift.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
we
do
not
ask
the
court
to
overrule
bogardus.
we
--
we
do
ask
the
court
to
explain
bogardus
and
we
think
bogardus
really
involves
a
--
application
of
what
we
--
we
call
just
--
it
purports
a
clarity,
a
motivation
test.
it
used
intention
in
the
sense
of
why
the
payment
was
made.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
pardon
and
well,
they
--
they
both
displease
me
in
using
the
--
the
language
of
intent.
we
think
they
both
agree
with
our
position.
i
--
i
may
suggest
that
the
rationalization
of
the
bogardus
case
has
to
start
with
judge
hand's
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
if
you
read
the
supreme
court
opinions
as
responsive
to
the
issues
stated
by
judge
hand,
i
--
i
think
it
--
it
then
becomes
clear
what
--
what
it
is
that
the
court
is
talking
about.
of
the
--
the
dissenting
opinion,
for
example,
speaks
of
--
whether
it
is
made
with
the
intention
to
show
goodwill,
affection
or
esteem.
now,
it
certainly
has
to
make
any
difference
whether
you
intent
to
show
this
or
when
you
--
when
you
intend
that
somebody
will
believe
that
you
have
these
feelings.
these
feelings
are
relevant
only
if
it
was
out
of
that
that
you
made
the
payment.
to
remove
by
it,
so
the
distinction
really
is
between
an
act
of
will
and
causation.
and
intent
i
--
we
think
it
only
mean
--
it's
properly
used
an
act
of
will.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
think,
it
is
there.
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
we
--
we
have
stated
it
in
a
black
letter
term.
what
we
used
the
phrase,
a
--
a
gift
is
a
payment
motivated
by
personal,
rather
than
business
reasons.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
requires
a
lot
of
explanation.
i
--
i
don't
think
you
can
accept
that
is
a
self-sustaining
statement.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
no,
no.
we
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
--
in
this
case
--
in
this
case,
if
i
--
if
i
gave
this
case
to
the
jury.
now,
i
--
i
would
ask
the
jury
whether
the
payment
was
a
result
of
a
sense
that
something
moore
was
doing
--
was
due
--
mr.
stanton,
on
occasion
of
his
departure,
whether
there
were
some
sense
that
he
had
not
been
fully
rewarded,
whether
there
is
a
--
a
sense
of
uneasiness
that's
causing
him
to
make
the
payment.
now,
in
fact
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
--
i
think
you
cannot
avoid
the
state
of
mind
to
provide
the
connection
between
a
service
and
the
payment.
the
--
the
actor
is
a
person
and
--
and
you
can't
make
the
connection
without
going
through
him.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
making
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
what
--
what
--
we
--
do
not--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
--
on
the
charges
you
give,
that
was
the
--
that
was
a
charge
that
the
government
did
not
accept,
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
--
i
do
not
believe
they
accepted
to
it
in
the
district
court
and
--
and
if
we
are
bound
by
that,
then
that
case
should
be
dismissed,
but
as
to
the
substance
of
the
charge,
i
would
not
object
most
strenuously
because
i
--
it
--
it
charges
that
all
in
the
legal
conclusions,
it
does
not
really
tell
anybody
what
it
is
there
to
look
for.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
oh
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
is
a
--
a
problem
of
avoiding
a
--
a
restrictive
meaning
of
--
of
words
like,
“do
an
obligation.”
judge
hand
in
bogardus,
used
the
phrase,
“whether
once
moved
by
some
scruple,”
some
--
some
sense
of
an
easiness
that
that
he
hasn't
fully
responded
as
he
should,
unless
he
makes
the
payment
that
it
satisfies
that
sense.
now,
that
--
that
is
the
most
subtle
problem,
which
will
very
sought
and
be
a
rate
--
be
raised.
letter
--
that
common
really
arises
first
of
all,
only
in
a
case
of
--
of
payments
by
individuals.
we
think
that
problem
so
--
selling
the
(inaudible)
in
--
in
--
by
a
corporation.
and
the
standard
that
we
draw
in
that
case
is
exactly
the
same
standard
of
connection
to
the
business
that
is
necessary
to
justify
a
business
expense.
now,
we
have
a
body
of
law
of
what
the
business
relationship
has
to
be,
to
justify
a
business
expense.
what
we're
really
saying
in
the
end
(inaudible)
would
like
to
get
there
is
that
you
apply
--
since
the
same
standard
of
business
relationship,
where
the
gift
purpose
has
to
do
for
the
business
expense
purpose.
now,
i
think
that
there
is
a
very
solemn
area
since
no
one
ever
looked
at
the
statute.
i
--
i
think
actually,
there's
a
great
deal
to
be
learned
from
the
statute
here,
when
--
i
think
it
--
it's
perhaps
the
strongest
support
for
our
definition
of
gifts
as
excluding
those
nature
for
business
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
assimilation
of
gifts
to
devices,
inheritances
and
--
and
bequest.
now
the
--
a
bequest
is
an
essentially
personal
matter.
i
--
these
are
interest
family
transfers
by
enlarge
and
you
can
be
understandably
--
they
involved
personal
kinds
of
motivation.
and
we
think
that
including
gifts
in
exclusion,
congress
had
in
mind
the
same
kind
of
transfer
in
a
--
in
revivals
transfers.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
let
me
clear
out
this
business
about
corporations.
the
--
in
the
relevance
of
corporation,
powers
and
capacity,
goes
only
to
result
in
the
factual
question.
we
do
not
have
assert
a
--
if
rule
of
the
federal
law
of
the
corporation
can't
make
a
gift
or
anything
of
the
sort.
we
say
that
when
a
corporation
has
made
a
payment.
you
can
answer
the
question,
why
did
they
make
the
payment,
by
asking
of
what
basis
was
the
use
of
corporate
assets
justified.
now,
on
this
case,
for
example,
we
--
we
ask
the
legal
question
on
what
basis
was
the
use
of
a
church
--
the
church's
assets
to
make
a
payment
to
mr.
stanton
justify.
now,
the
only
conceivable
basis
on
which
that
would
be
justified
is
as
a
recondition
that
something
more
is
due
mr.
stanton.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
yes,
as
a
matter
of
corporation
law.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
we
used
them
only
as
an
evident
--
evidentiary
presumption,
that
we
presumed
that
the
vestrymen
did
not
committed
the
breach
of
trust.
and
that
therefore,
unless
someone
is
going
to
come
forth
and
contend
that
they
did,
you
have
to
accept
as
the
reason
for
the
payment
that
reason
which
--
which
made
it
a
proper
expenditure
and
that
that
really
fill
the
used
the
--
the
corporate
powers.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
yes
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right
and
that's
true
--
that's
true
in
all
of
the
cases.
and
so
--
so
the
presumption
that
was
proper
is
virtually
controlling
in
all
the
cases.
now,
mr.
stanton
isn't
contending
that
anyone
committed
breach
of
trust.
and
we
aren't
continually
committed
breach
of
trust.
therefore,
the
--
there's
no
issue
here.
the
presumption
that
it
was
proper
payment
controls.
and
the
only
that
it
could
be
a
proper
payment
is
that
in
no
more
than
reasonable
compensation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
i
--
i
must
resume
i
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
sir.
there
is
always
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
--
if
the
payor,
in
your
case,
were
a
corporation
and
it
were
true
as
a
matter
of
state
law
which
is
undoubtedly
would
be,
that
he
could
have
made
the
payment,
unless
it
were
justified
by
the
past
services.
unless
it
was
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
well,
we
--
we
get
to
a
problem
--
for
example,
take
--
take
the
case
of
the
--
a
payment
that
is
unanimously
approved
by
the
stockholders.
now,
we
don't
think
a
majority
approval
makes
any
difference,
because
the
majority
stockholders
had
the
same
duty
to
use
the
corporate
assets
only
for
business
purposes
as
the
directors
do.
but
if
it's
unanimously
approved
by
the
stockholders,
that
may
bar
our
use
of
the
presumption,
because
the
--
the
stockholders,
unless
creditors
were
prejudiced,
could
use
the
--
the
assets
or
whatever
they
wanted
to.
but
then
a
federal
rule
comes
into
play
of
income
attribution.
now,
if
the
stockholders,
say
a
family
corporation,
did
use
the
business
assets
to
make
a
gift
to
a
widow,
of
--
of
the
president
of
corporation.
this
is
fairly
completive
most
to
the
weight
of
bonus
cases.
now,
if
that
--
if
there
was
a
business
justification
for
the
use
of
the
corporate
assets,
let
us
say
that
--
that
--
because
of
the
past
services
performed,
the
corporation
felt
a
--
a
sense
of
obligation
to
make
some
provision
for
the
widow.
then,
of
course,
it
would
be
income
(inaudible)
they
would
to
the
widow.
it
would
not
be
a
gift
to
her.
if
on
the
other
hand,
of
the
sought
to
be
shown,
that
wasn't
quite
a
major
payment
at
all.
the
reason
they
made
the
payment
is
the
stockholders
happen
to
like
the
widow
or
felt
personal
sympathy
for
the
widow.
it
would
follow
then
that
--
that
--
of
course,
it
was
--
it
was
a
gift
to
the
widow.
but
by
the
same
token,
it
was
a
distribution
by
the
corporation
to
the
stockholders,
the
dividend
of
the
stockholders.
they've
used
corporate
funds
to
satisfy
their
personal
purposes.
now,
that's
why
i
say
that
--
that
if
we
can
define
a
gift
in
terms
exclusive
of
business
reasons
--
actually,
we
were
very
seldom
be
a
litigated
case,
because
the
recipient
is
not
going
to
claim.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
did
i
say
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
could
direct
the
statute
that
--
that
would
cover
these
things.
problems
of
this
sort,
i
think,
are
--
are
sometimes
easier
to
handle.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
pretty
closely,
pretty
closely,
but
let
me
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
no,
i
don
t
wanna
say
that,
if
i
--
if
i've
said
that
i
want
to
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
the
case
of
a
--
individual
who
makes
a
payment
to
someone
who
has
previously
performed
services
for
him.
we
give
you
the
example
on
our
brief
of
--
but
first
we
get
the
extreme
examples,
someone
rescues
her
child
and
you
were
moved
to
make
a
lavish
reward.
now,
for
safety
that's
--
that's
our
gratitude
for
services,
but
it
is
more
than
that.
your
response
involves
a
--
a
--
emotional
response.
now,
a
--
a
more
borderline
case,
we
put
in
our
beacon
and
--
and
stanton.
where
a
sole
proprietor
has
made
his
fortune
and
his
business,
then
sold
the
business
to
retired
and
now
he's
got
millions
of
dollars
and
doesn't
know
what
to
do
with
them
and
he
doesn't
want
his
aunt
to
get
it
when
he
dies.
and
he's
moved
out
of
the
--
just
a
sense
of
goodwill
to
make
a
generous
distribution
to
all
of
his
old
employees.
now
we
don't
say
that
can't
be
a
gift,
we
say
if
the
--
whether
it
is
or
not,
deters
upon
the
question
it
backed,
whether
he
was
moved
by
any
of
sense
of
that
something
more
in
equity
and
fairness
was
due
the
employees.
now,
i
don't
mean
to
--
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
--
to
state
a
test
of
--
of
legal
obligation,
a
moral
obligation,
but
something
that
makes
it
as
--
as
learned
hand
said,
“something
less
than
an
unconstrained
act
of
generosity.”
or
it
is
the
sense
of
--
of
composure,
if
i
may
--
that
is
owing
and
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
well,
that
--
that
is
our
explanation
of
bogardus.
that
--
that
bogardus
actually
adopts
the
same
line
that
learned
hand
tried
to
spell
out
so
carefully.
now,
the
opinion
there
talks
about
the
stockholders
removed
--
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
is
this
really
the
bogardus
case,
except
that
we
have
the
complications
of
corporations,
but
the
payment
there
was
treated
by
the
court
as
having
been
made
by
the
former
stockholders
themselves,
not
by
--
this
new
corporation.
and
so
they
were
in
the
same
positions
as
my
sole
proprietor,
who
has
retired
from
the
business.
and
if
you
read
the
supreme
court
opinions
in
the
light
of
the
--
of
the
issue
stated
by
judge
hand,
of
whether
it's
unrestrained
generosity
or
a
sense
of
--
of
something
more
being
due.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
not
--
not
sure.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
all
you
think
does
is
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
that
--
that
is
true
--
if
you
very
carefully
define
donative
intent
to
mean
that.
the
most
course
don't
mean
that,
when
they
say
donative
intent.
what
they
mean
is
that
i
didn't
have
a
legal
obligation
and
i
intended
that
he
should
have
the
money.
and
that's
donative
intent.
now
--
and
that's
not
what
i
mean
by
it.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
it's
what
you
mean
by
it.
and
--
what
we
would
like
to
do
is
avoid
to
use
of
words
like
intent
and
like
consideration
that
--
that
aren't
--
don't,
themselves,
convey
any
specific
meaning
you
have
to
--
have
to
spell
out
exactly
what
mean
before
they
--
they're
useful.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
we
--
we've
even
tried
similar
to
avoid
saying
motive
and
rather
say
the
reasons
why
the
payment
is
made.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
hope
i
can
better
--
no
he
--
he
won.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
i
--
i
would
like
to
correct
that.
it
was
the
same
way
before
bogardus
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
let
--
we
would
agree
with
--
with
judge
hand
in
bogardus,
that
was
there
are
question
of
fact,
but
only
after
he
said
what
the
question
fact
was?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
he
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
but
he
said
what
the
question
fact
was.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
as
mr.
duberstein's
counsel
yesterday
pointed
out
and
waivered
somewhat
and
how
to
approach
bogardus
and
we
ended
up
trying
to
rationalize
it.
and
i
--
that
i
think
greatly,
your
honor.actually
i
--
the
rationalization
i
found
in
judge
hand's
opinion.
but
actually
--
that's
why
we
think
it
--
we
need
a
standard
that
is
of
easy
application.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
let
me
say
that
in
20
cases,
in
20
cases,
i
purport
to
refer
to
the
presumption
that
a
corporation
cannot
make
a
gift
to
its
officers
and
employees.
and
in
every
case,
every
case
--
now,
was
that
presumption
has
been
inferred
to,
it
was
held
not
to
be
a
gift.
and
one
case
said
nothing
more
than
that.
that's
--
that
is
an
answer
to
almost
all
of
these
cases,
it's
the
answer
to
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff
was
not
a
gift,
because
the
vestryman
could
not
give
away
the
church's
assets,
unless
it
was
reasonable
compensation
for
their
services.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
let
--
let
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
let
me
say
they're
not
--
everything
that
we
have
argued
here,
we
--
we
expect
the
court
to
be
able
to
accomplish
in
one
opinion.
we
have
felt
that
our
duty
to
try
to
make
a
framework
at
least
and
which
to
think
about
the
problem.
and
i
really
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
if
you
can't
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
--
i
hope
the
one
conceives
the
other.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
so
far
as
i
encounter
the
record,
we
made
no
request
for
more
specific
findings
nor
did
the
other
side.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
no
--
no
one
know
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
going
to
be
taken
to
the
supreme
court.
i've
learn
this
to
know
there
--
i
know
a
case
which
we
have
thousands
and
it
was
not
that
careful
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
--
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
question
of
fact
in
this
case
which
they
would
be,
we
say,
if
it
were
contended
that
this
payment
was
made
because
the
vestryman
like
mr.
stanton
not
--
not
because
he
had
performed
services
for
the
corporation,
that
they
likely
there
would
be
a
question
of
fact
namely,
whether
they
reach
their
trust
by
using
the
church's
assets
for
their
personal
purposes.
if
that
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
not
unless
it
is
contended
that
the
directors
and
vestryman
made
the
payment
because
of
their
personal
affection
for
mr.
stanton.
i
don't
think
they
make
that
contention.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
--
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
did
argue
this
business
about
possible
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
i
--
i
can
say
--
i
can
state
the
challenge
as
one
of
insufficient
evidence,
but
what
i'm
really
saying
is
that
if
you
apply
the
right
test,
the
right
definition
of
a
gift,
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
an
inclusion
that
these
directors
violated
their
trust,
their
duties
to
the
church
by
giving
away
the
assets
for
their
personal
reasons.
and
that
was
that
the
only
claim
that
would
raise
the
question
of
fact.
there's
no
evidence
of
that.
and
therefore,
the
--
the
finding
of
fact
is
not
supported
by
the
evidence,
but
since
it's
just
the
problem
of
definition
other
than
one
of
evidence.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
we
had
--
we
have
tried
to
say
that
intent
is
an
act
of
will
and
we
agreed
that
they
intended
with
all
their
might
that
this
be
a
gift
that
it
be
not
taxable
to
mr.
stanton.
they
wanted
it
not
to
be
taxable.
i
dare
say
they
were
advised
by
counsel
that
that
depended
upon
whether
they
intended
as
a
gift
and
therefore,
they
did
intend
it
as
a
gift.
we
--
we
concede
that.
we
--
we
think
certainly,
the
result
does
not
depend
upon
that
kind
of
--
of
act
or
will.
thank
you
very
much.
