justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
elman,
isn't
that
true
actually
whether
they
use
multi
reasons
of
what
not
would
be
the
ends
out
to
get
back
to
was
their
act,
don't
they
do
that
intent,
will
you
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
doesn't
our
court
--
our
(inaudible)
have
said
that
his
own
declarations
of
serving
are
not
conclusive
at
all.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
mean
justified
as
a
legal
expenditure?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
another
of
concern
to
the
commissioner?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
barnett,
does
your
--
oh,
excuse
me,
excuse
me
--
do
you
--
pardon.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
not
the
bogardus
rule
take
account
of
that
theory?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understood
you
though,
you
would
require
a
jury
or
the
fact-finder,
if
not
a
jury
to
negate
any
feeling
or
condition
of
the
payment
being
for
something
not
previously
done
that
should
have
been
done.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
ought.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
does
not
if
the
requirement
at
the
jury
find
that
the
transfer
was
made
solely
out
of
a
dominative
pertinence
and
intent,
without
consideration,
negate
any
such
feeling
that
something
was
due?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
words,
for
example,
could
you
use?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
conceive
that
(inaudible)
that
the
government
said
the
corporation
did
intend
to
make
a
gift
from
mr.
stanton?
