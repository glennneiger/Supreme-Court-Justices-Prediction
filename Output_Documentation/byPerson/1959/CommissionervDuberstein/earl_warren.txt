what
is
the
question
again,
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
elman,
may
i
ask
you
this
question
that
may
not
bear
in
your
case
particularly,
but
suppose
he
had
expected
something
without
an
agreement,
but
suppose
he
thought
“well,
i
get
them
these
customers,
i
will
get
something,”
would
that
affect
your
case
any?
chief
justice
earl
warren
immaterial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief

mr.

you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
mean
as
far
as
it
is
possible?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
course,
you
meant,
if
--
if
the
corporation
had
--
had
the
power
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
the
--
does
the
--
the
corporation
that
made
the
--
made
the
gift
have
the
right
to
make
gifts
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
didn't
suppose
that
the
corporate
capacity
would
come
directly
under
review,
but
--
but
might
it
not
be
--
might
it
not
be
important
to
determine
whether
it
was
a
gift
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
do
you
ask
us
to
read
that
--
read
out
that
language
above
pension
--
pension
rights
entirely
as
being
--
as
being
inconsequential?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
last
statement
regardless
you
said,
whether
it
was
with
or
without
consideration.
do
you
--
do
you
mean
that
even
though
there
was
consideration
for
the
--
for
this
payment
that
was
made
that
--
it
--
it
would
still
be
a
gift?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
should
not
be
considered.
i
didn't
understand
you
to
say
that
it
--
it
was
here,
which
you
said
without
regard
to
--
to
whether
there
was
consideration
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
barnett.
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
you
speak
a
little
louder
please,
mr.
barnett.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
a
little
closure
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
microphone
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
one
or
two.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
barnett,
if
you're
going
to
put
up
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
there's
something
still
do,
about
the
case
you've
just
preceded
this
one.
i
thought
mr.
elman
--
i
thought
mr.
elman
says
that
--
that
in
that
case
there
--
there
wasn't
anything
due.
mr.
--
what
is
his
name,
the
plaintiff?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
have
he
--
have
he
asked
anything,
he
was
an
entitled
to
get
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
get
anything,
but
he
gave
it
to
him.
now,
why
would
you
--
what
to
do,
would
be
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barnett
[laughter]
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barnett,
i
notice
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
here
are
only
two
sentences.
and
they
just
--
if
the
judges
finds
the
ultimate
fact
that
this
was
a
--
a
gratuity
and
therefore,
need
not
have
been
reported
as
income,
did
you
propose
any
findings
below
that
would
--
that
would
set
this
thing
up
in
some
form,
so
that
an
appellate
court
could
have
something
to
pass
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
no?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
--
there
are
no
reason
for
them
to
do
it
because
it
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
was
absolutely
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
they
were
asking
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
why
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
why
would
you
try
to
prepare
a
record
for
us
from
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
why
it'd
been
in
here
for
this
and
then
proper
shape?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
--
you
mean
then
that
there
was
no
question
of
fact
here
for
the
trial
court
to
decide?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
did
you
make
the
--
did
you
make
the
contention
in
the
trial
court
that
this
was
beyond
the
--
the
province
of
the
board
of
directors
to
--
to
give
such
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then,
how
did
you
get
--
do
you
--
did
you
--
do
you
challenge
--
do
you
challenge
the
findings
of
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
what
grounds?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
--
what
is
--
what
--
on
what
grounds
do
you
know
or
at
anytime
challenge
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court?

justice
earl
warren
mr
lee.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
