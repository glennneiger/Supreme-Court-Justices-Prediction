mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
which
is
here
from
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
next
case,
the
stanton
case,
which
is
here
from
the
second
circuit,
also
presents
the
question
of
distinguishing
between
gifts
and
income
for
federal
tax
purposes.
as
mr.
rauh
pointed
out
unlike
the
kaiser
case,
these
two
cases
present
the
issue
in
the
more
familiar
general
context
of
payments
in
commercial
and
employment
relationships
and
they
do
not
involve
the
special
differentiating
factors
as
to
strike
benefit
payments
upon
which
mr.
rauh
has
relied.
the
facts
of
the
duberstein
case
are
extremely
simple.
they
are
not
in
dispute
and
indeed,
they
are
based
entirely
upon
the
testimony
of
the
taxpayer
himself
and
his
account.
mr.
duberstein
is
the
president
of
an
iron
and
metal
company
in
dayton,
ohio.
that
company
did
business
with
another
corporation
in
new
york
city,
the
mohawk
metal
company
of
which
the
president
was
mr.
berman.
and
the
transactions
between
these
two
companies
were
usually
conducted
over
the
telephone,
conversations
between
these
two
men.
and
occasionally,
mr.
berman
would
inquire
of
mr.
duberstein
if
he
knew
the
names
of
certain
customers
who
used
chemical
products
which
were
sold
by
the
mohawk
company
but
not
by
duberstein's
company
and
if
mr.
duberstein
had
such
information,
he
would
furnish
it
to
mr.
berman.
he
testified
and
we
accept
his
testimony
entirely
that
he
gave
this
information
pituitously
without
any
hope
or
expectation
of
payment
or
reward.
nonetheless,
in
1951,
as
mr.
rauh
has
told
you,
he
received
from
the
mohawk
company,
a
cadillac
for
which
the
company
paid
$4250
and
the
ultimate
question
in
the
case
is
whether
that's
a
gift
or
income
to
mr.
duberstein.
now,
the
circumstances
in
which
that
cadillac
was
given
were
described
by
mr.
duberstein.
and
again,
i
wish
to
make
it
clear
that
we
accept
this
testimony
and
all
the
implications
of
it
entirely.
mr.
berman
called
mr.
duberstein
on
the
telephone
from
new
york
and
he,
mr.
berman,
told
that
due
to
the
fact
that
the
information
i
had
given
him
was
so
helpful
that
he
felt
he
wanted
to
give
me
a
present
and
i
told
him
he
didn't
owe
me
anything
and
he
said,
“well,
he
had
a
cadillac
car
as
a
gift.”
now
i
should
send
to
new
york
to
receive
it
which
i
finally
did.
i
told
him
he
owed
me
nothing
and
i
didn't
expect
anything
for
the
information.
i
didn't
intend
to
be
compensated,
but
he
insisted
that
i
accept
this
cadillac
car.
on
cross-examination,
he
was
asked
whether
he
thought
he
would
have
gotten
this
car,
had
he
not
given
the
information
to
mr.
berman.
his
answer
was,
“i
don't
think
so.”
mr.
duberstein
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
question
was,
“mr.
duberstein,
this
information,
i
believe,
you
testified
proved
valuable
to
mohawk.
had
you
not
given
him
this
information,
would
you
still
have
gotten
this
cadillac
car”
and
the
taxpayer
answered,
“i
don't
think
so.”
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
think
it
would
be
necessary
to
support
our
position
here.
we
would
merely
confirm
what
we
think
to
be
perfectly
clear
from
the
taxpayer's
own
testimony
that
this
car
was
given
in
payment
of
services
rendered,
whether
or
not
the
recipient
received
it,
we
think
it's
wholly
immaterial.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
he
wasn't
--
he
wasn't
asked
that
question.
i
think
i
should
say,
in
fairness
to
mr.
duberstein
that
when
he
discovered
in
1954,
he
did
not
show
it
on
his
income
tax
return,
he
treated
as
a
gift.
he
found
out
about
this
thing
apparently
the
first
time,
three
years
later
in
1954.
the
internal
revenue
service
was
auditing
mohawk's
return
in
new
york
and
they
discovered
that
mohawk
had
deducted
the
cost
of
this
car
as
a
business
expense,
treating
it
as
a
payment
in
the
nature
of
a
finder's
fee.
at
that
point,
the
internal
revenue
service
again
had
look
at
mr.
duberstein's
return
and
inquired
of
him
as
to
the
transaction.
and
mr.
duberstein's
account
on
his
instructions
got
in
touch
with
mohawk's
account
and
asked
why
it
was,
that
mohawk
had
taken
this
deduction.
apparently,
mr,
duberstein
was
not
only
surprised.
he
was
quite
(inaudible).
this
had
been
done
and
the
accountant
testified,
this
is
on
page
21
of
the
record
that
he
had
talked
–
he
--
mohawk's
accountant
that
is,
had
talked
with
mr.
berman,
explained
to
mr.
berman
that
the
cadillac
was
recorded
as
a
gift,
it
would
not
be
deductible
as
such.
mr.
berman
wanted
to
know
how
it
would
be
deducted
and
presumably
the
accountant
told
him
it
would
be
deductible
if
it
was
treated
by
the
corporation
as
its
business
expense.
now,
i
think
it
might
be
pointed
out
here
that
from
the
government's
standpoint,
form
the
standpoint
of
just
the
revenue
involved
getting
additional
taxes,
we
would
be
in
a
more
advantageous
position
if
this
were,
in
fact,
a
gift
from
mr.
berman
personally
as
individual
capacity
to
mr.
duberstein
because
in
that
event,
even
though
mr.
duberstein
would
report
it
as
income,
he
would
treat
it
as
a
gift
assuming
it
was
a
valid
gift
on
the
analysis
which
i
propose
to
make.
berman,
of
course,
could
not
deduct
it,
personal
gifts
are
not
deductible.
the
corporation
could
not
deduct
it.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
--
since
the
corporate
funds
were
being
used
for
this
purpose,
there
might
--
would
it
be
a
proper
case
of
treating
that
$4250
which
was
used
for
that
purpose
by
berman
so
that
he
could
make
a
gift
in
his
individual
capacity
to
duberstein,
he
would
be
using
corporation
funds
and
there
would
be
a
constructive
distribution
to
him
on
which
he
would
pay
tax
so
the
corporation
couldn't
take
the
deduction
on
the
money
that
was
used
to
pay
the
car
and
neither
could
berman.
now,
so
that,
as
i
say,
the
question
is
to
whether
it's
gift
or
not,
it
doesn't
really
depend
on
whether
government
is
going
to
benefit
it
from
a
tax
standpoint
and
it
shouldn't
depend
on
that.
now,
on
these
facts
which
are
undisputed,
the
tax
court
held
that
it
was
not
a
gift.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
tax
court
and
held
it
was
a
gift.
and
although
they
both
reached
opposite
conclusions,
both
courts
stated
the
question
in
precisely
the
same
way.
and
you
will
find
a
regular
pattern
through
the
gift
appealed.
the
opinions
are
all
pretty
read
in
the
same
way.
the
question
whether
it's
a
gift
depends
upon
–
is
a
question
of
fact
depending
upon
the
intention
of
the
donor.
if
he
intended
to
make
a
gift,
it's
a
gift
and
if
he
did
not
intend
to
make
a
gift,
it's
not
a
gift.
generalizations
cannot
safely
be
made
here.
each
case
turns
upon
its
own
particular
facts.
therefore,
we
have
to
look
to
all
the
circumstances
in
the
case.
and
that
formulation
of
the
issue
in
terms
of
looking
to
the
intention
of
the
donor,
did
he
or
did
he
not
intend
to
make
a
gift
has
we
believe
contributed
to
a
good
deal
of
the
confusion
that
one
finds
going
through
the
hundred
odd
cases
that
have
been
decided
in
this
broad
area.
the
intention
of
the
donor
to
make
a
gift
that
is
the
test.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
mr.
justice
black,
we
suggest
that
the
intention
to
make
a
gift,
looking
to
the
donor
to
see
what
his
state
of
mind
was
in
relation
to
this
payment
requires
and
we
think
that
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
as
well
as
this
court
have
really
made
this
inquiry
although
they
haven't
put
it
in
precisely
the
terms
in
which
we
have
had
them
on,
it
really
requires
an
inquiry
into
the
reasons
for
the
payment.
the
difference
between
a
christmas
cheque
to
an
employee
and
a
christmas
cheque
to
a
son
does
not
lie
in
any
difference
as
to
the
intention
of
the
donor
to
make
a
gift
in
the
sense
that
he
intends
to
give
everything
for
legal
and
beneficial
interest
in
the
property
being
transferred.
the
intention
to
make
the
gift
language
is
taken
from
the
property
law
where
the
--
where
for
purposes
of
distinguishing
between
a
gift
and
a
loan
or
a
gift
and
a
trust
or
sale
of
(inaudible)
a
transfers
something
to
b
and
the
inquiry
and
its
controlling
its
decisiveness,
did
a
intend
to
make
a
gift?
now
if
that
were
the
--
if
that
were
the
test
for
tax
purposes,
you
would
have
no
problem.
every
time
there
was
a
gift
in
the
property
in
contract
law
sense
that
would
be
it.
there
would
be
no
need
to
go
any
further,
but
if
there's
anything
that's
clear
and
there's
somewhat
confused
field,
it
is
that
the
property
contract
law
definition
of
gift
cannot
control
and
it's
never
been
thought
to
be
controlling
because
obviously,
there
are
many
categories
of
voluntary
payments.
they're
not
merely
payments
by
employers
and
employees,
but
there
are
many
categories
of
voluntary
payments,
gifts
in
the
property
contract
common-law
sense,
which
are
treated
as
taxable
income
to
the
recipient,
not
merely
bonuses
to
employees
but
such
a
common
place
of
gratuities
as
tips
and
bonuses,
honorary
and
so
on.
and
how
do
you
--
what's
--
how
do
you
differentiate
that
kind
of
“gift”
which
is
taxable
to
the
recipient
from
the
kind
of
gift
which
isn't
and
that
--
and
you
can't
answer
that
question
by
saying,
“it's
the
intention
of
the
donor
to
make
a
gift”,
because
in
all
cases,
he
intends
to
make
a
gift.
if
a
head
waiter
shows
you
to
a
fine
table
in
a
restaurant,
you
can
say
to
him,
“i
am
so
grateful
and
i
want
to
show
my
appreciation
for
your
courtesy
and
your
kindness,
i'm
going
to
give
you
$5
and
i
intend
this
to
be
a
gift.”
now,
the
intention
--
the
intention
to
make
a
gift
is
clear.
there
maybe
even
an
intention
that
the
--
that
the
waiter
should
not
have
to
pay
income
tax
on
it,
that's
immaterial.
mr.
philip
elman
i
know
[laughter]
i
know
that
there
are
waiters
--
there
are
waiters
who
have
been
sent
to
jail
for
not
reporting
it
tips.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
there's
no
question
no
one
--
no
one
doubts
--
no
one
doubts
that
one
who
has
--
which
rendered
services
even
and
who
has
received
payment,
even
though
the
person
who
has
received
the
benefit
of
those
services
has
--
was
given
full
legal
compensation,
given
everything
that's
due
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
tax
court
found
our
way.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
but
this
case
was
not
brought
here
to
the
--
by
the
government
simply
in
order
to
reinstate
the
tax
court
decision
which
from
--
what
we
are
really
seeking,
mr.
justice,
is
clarification
of
the
legal
test
for
determining
this
question
of
fact.
it
was
asked
in
the
preceding
argument,
is
this
a
question
of
fact
or
is
it
a
question
of
law?
of
course,
it's
a
--
it's
a
question
of
fact
in
the
sense
that
the
conclusion
turns
upon
the
facts,
but
it
is
a
question
of
law
as
to
what
facts
are
relevant
and
significant.
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
justice,
we
are
hoping
that
--
that
in
these
two
cases
found
in
duberstein,
you
will
provide
guidance
to
the
internal
revenue
service
which
has
--
which
has
these
cases
ever
increasing
number
with
the
--
with
the
increase
in
rates
of
taxation.
since
world
war
ii,
there's
been
a
proliferation
of
this
so-called
business
gifts.
the
search
for
sources
of
economic
benefits
out
of
tax
free
income
will
not
end
with
these
cases,
it
will
undoubtedly
go
on
but
we
are
hoping
that
you'll
give
the
commissioner
and
the
taxpayers
and
the
lower
courts
guidance
as
to
what
they
should
look
for
when
they
look
at
the
facts
--
mr.
philip
elman
we
--
we
believe
--
we
believe
that
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brandeis
as
in
the
bogardus
case,
the
opinion
of
judge
learned
hand
in
the
bogardus
case
in
88
2d.,
which
we
think
really
was
summarized
briefly
and
compendiously
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
this
court,
accurately
states
the
question
because
although
the
word
“intention”
is
used,
the
test
is
really
–
as
stated
by
the
dissent
is
choosing
among
competing
motives
that
dominated
the
conduct.
that's
just
another
way
of
saying,
“why
was
the
gift
made?
what
was
the
reason?”
not
that
he
intend
to
make
a
gift
in
the
common-law
property
sense
of
conveying
full
beneficial
and
legal
interest.
did
he
intend
to
make
a
gift
in
the
sense
that
the
recipient
shouldn't
have
to
pay
a
tax?
but
was
he
making
the
gift
for
a
gift
reason
and
that
requires
the
court
to
define
a
“gift
reason”.
now
mr.
justice
brandeis
--
mr.
philip
elman
not
at
all.
we
accept
not
only
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
--in
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
the
bogardus
case,
i
must
say
in
all
--
in
all
candor
has
--
has
been
a
contributing
factor
in
the
--
in
the
lack
of
enlightenment
which
provide
this
area
because
of
the
use
of
the
word
“intention.”
the
word
intention
as
used
in
the
property
law
sense
has
been
--
has
been
--
mr.
philip
elman
we
reject
--
we
reject
the
reasoning
of
a
tax
court
as
well
as
--
as
well
as
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
true
--
it's
true
that
the
court,
the
tax
court
found
for
us
but
we
did
--
a
per
curiam
reinstatement
of
the
tax
court's
decision
in
this
case,
well
it
might
be
provide
some
revenue
–
we
think
it
only
compound
the
confusions.
mr.
philip
elman
the
real
issue,
as
we
see
it,
is
to
distinguish
between
gift
reasons
and
non-gift
reasons.
and
we
think
that
the
inquiry
of
the
trier
fact
has
to
be
into
the
reasons.
and
we
think
that
the
dividing
line
between
gift
and
non-gift
is
the
line
that
distinguishes
between
personal
reasons
on
the
one
side
whether
they'd
be
good
reasons,
bad
reasons
and
no
reasons,
whether
they'd
be
reasons
of
love
or
reasons
of
hatred,
whether
they'd
be
reasons
of
benevolence
or
malevolence,
a
gift
can
be
made
out
of
--
out
of
--
the
most
meretricious
reasons
and
then
they
want
to
get
his
picture
on
the
paper,
but
it's
still
a
gift
if
we
think
if
it's
made
for
any
personal
reason.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
we
--
mr.
philip
elman
so
far
as
an
individual
was
concerned
--
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
justice,
so
far
as
the
gifts
between
two
individuals
are
concerned,
this
question
of
fact
maybe
difficult
but
those
cases
will
not
arise
because
ordinary
they
have
no
tax
significance,
putting
charitable
gifts
aside
and
we
are
not
talking
about
charitable
gifts
at
all
here.
a
gift
by
--
a
gift
by
the
donor
is
not
deductible
by
him
and
it's
in
the
fact
that
it's
not
reported
as
income
to
the
--
by
the
recipient
has
no
--
no
real
tax
significance.
the
line
that
we
are
suggesting,
which
we
think
is
based
upon
the
structure
and
design
of
the
statute
as
well
as
all
the
cases
that
you
decide
in
this
area
is
the
difference
between
so-called
“gifts
for
personal
reasons”
and
gifts
“for
reasons
that
are
so
closely
related
to
the
production
of
income
or
so
closely
related
to
an
income
producing
activity,
the
performances
and
services
of
the
carrying
on
of
a
business
for
profit,”
that
the
expenditure
for
that
purpose
is
deductible
as
a
business
expense.
we
think
that
the
structure
of
the
statute
excludes
the
notion
that
you
could
have
a
deductible
gift.
mr.
philip
elman
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
get
the
(inaudible).
[laughter]
mr.
justice,
five
charitable
gifts
are
concerned
--
there's
no
problem
and
the
statute
itself
deals
with
that.
a
charitable
gift
is
deductible
by
a
corporation.
now,
we
do
not
contend
and
we
could
not
contend
that
there's
anything
in
the
federal
tax
law
that
prevents
corporations
from
making
gifts,
they're
not
charitable
–
the
leading
case
in
this
area
is
the
case
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
not
to
argue
when
mr.
justice
brennan
was
sitting
there,
the
18
smith
case,
which
recognizes
that
corporations
too
sharing
the
benefits
of
our
society
may
properly
be
called
upon
to
share
in
the
burden
and
a
corporation
where
it
may
properly
do
so
under
--
under
the
applicable
state
law
may
make
a
gift.
but
when
you're
dealing
with
a
--
dealing
it
with
a
corporation
which
is
making
a
gift
not
to
the
red
cross
or
not
to
the
victims
of
a
disaster
but
to
an
employee
or
to
someone
who
has
rendered
a
business
service
of
value
to
the
corporation,
then
you
have
--
then
as
--
then
you
don't
have
to
worry
too
much
about
the
issues
of
fact
or
the
triers
of
fact
because
if
you
have
really
a
double
barreled
presumption,
the
presumption
which
almost
all
these
cases
recognized
that
where
--
where
a
payment
is
made
from
an
employer
or
an
employee,
there's
a
--
the
presumption
is
but
it's
not
a
gift.
and
the
second
perhaps
most
important
presumption,
more
important
presumption
in
this
context
is
that
corporate
--
officers
of
the
corporation,
trustees
of
the
corporate
funds,
they
are
fiduciary,
it
is
a
bridge
of
trust
for
an
officer
of
a
corporation
to
make
a
gift
of
the
corporation's
property
to
a
friend
for
personal
reasons.
ordinarily,
it
is
presumed
that
the
corporation
directors
and
officers
do
not
engage
in
such
breaches
of
trust.
they
are
not
committing
a
misuse
or
ways
of
the
corporation's
assets
and
that
therefore,
when
they
do
make
a
payment
where
it
is
conceivable
that
motives
of
a
personal
nature
entered
into
it,
you
--
you
are
entitled
to
presume
unless
the
taxpayer
should
undertake
to
show
that
the
officers
who
made
them
this
gift
whether
the
breach
of
trust
and
it's
been
--
usually
corporate
funds
for
that
purpose
is
really
practical
to
them.
in
the
absence
of
any
attempt
by
the
taxpayer
to
make
such
a
showing,
there's
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
presumption
that
the
expenditure
was
made
for
a
proper
corporate
purpose
and
a
proper
corporate
purpose
is
to
further
the
business
interest
of
the
corporation.
and
if
that
in
fact
is
so
–
the
presumption
at
least
carries
you
that
far
in
the
absence
of
the
evidence
to
the
contrary,
there
is
really
no
difficulty
so
far
as
trying
these
case
are
concerned.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
if
–
if
i
think
it
makes
a
big
difference.
i
think
it
makes
a
big
difference
whether
you're
dealing
with
individual
proprietor
(voice
overlap).
mr.
philip
elman
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
if
that's
all
there
is,
i
think
it
is
clearly
not
a
gift
because
the
officers
and
directors
of
the
corporation
could
not
make
that
gift
for
personal
reasons.
i'm
assuming
now
that
the
court
accepts
our
formulation,
not
in
precise
terms
but
approximately
as
i've
suggested
it.
the
distinction
is
really
between
personal
reasons
and
there
are
vast
panoply
of
personal
reasons
that
covers
in
business
reasons.
if
it
--
if
it
is
a
gift
to
this
superannuated
employee,
only
if
the
gift
is
made
by
the
donor
for
personal
reasons,
a
corporation
pre
--
presumptively
cannot
make
use
its
property
in
order
to
satisfy
the
feelings
of
affection,
compassion
of
its
directors.
if
the
directors
want
to
make
a
gift
to
the
--
to
the
--
to
his
older
employee
for
his
long
and
faithful
services,
the
personal
reasons
--
mr.
philip
elman
pardon?
mr.
philip
elman
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
might
very
well
make
a
difference
because
then
you're
getting
close
to
the
situation
that
you
had
in
bogardus.
the
point
about
the
bogardus
case
is
that
in
bogardus,
the
gift
was
not
from
the
corporation
as
the
--
as
the
majority
treated
it
the
stockholders
were
just
using
the
corporation
as
an
agent
or
a
conduit
through
which
they
were
making
the
gift
and
the
court,
mr.
justice
sutherland
speaking
for
the
court
said
that
the
stockholders
were
moved
to
an
act
of
spontaneous
generosity.
there
again,
he
was
--
the
court
was
saying
this
was
a
personal
reason
on
the
point
of
stockholders.
now,
of
course,
if
the
stockholders
make
the
gift,
then
as
far
as
the
corporation
is
concerned,
there's
been
a
distribution
of
stockholders
and
the
corporation
making
the
gift
and
there's
really
no
harm
and
no
incongruity
in
reaching
out
of
conclusion
that
were
in
fact
the
gift
comes
from
the
stockholders
for
personal
reasons,
the
recipient
doesn't
pay
any
tax
on
it.
it's
a
gift
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
but
the
important
thing
is
it's
not
deductible
by
the
corporation
and
to
that
extent
to
us,
it's
highly
significant
that
the
so-called
donor
in
these
gift
cases
is
either
a
corporation
or
other
business
entity
which
is
engaged
in
activities
for
profit
and
i
should
like
to
reserve
through
it
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
elman
we
don't
disagree.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
think
that
the
bogardus'
opinion
really
has
been
overruled
so
far
as
–
the
point
of
the
dissent
was
not
only
in
--
in
relation
to
the
definition
of
a
gift,
but
the
–
as
i
read
--
as
i
read
the
opinion,
it
says,
“this
is
a
kind
of
a
question
as
to
which
the
trier
fact
could
have
come
out
either
way.
and
since
the
--
and
since
the
board
of
tax
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
found
it
was
not
a
gift,
there's
no
reason
why
we
should
disturb
it.”
now,
if
bogardus
had
come
up
today
so
far
as
the
standard
of
review
is
concerned,
just
difference
to
the
lower
court
determinations,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
as
to
what
this
court
would
do
and
the
dissent
was
really
on
the
–
fundamentally
on
that.
but
on
the
definition
--
mr.
philip
elman
right.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
now
--
but
what
we're
really
concerned
about
is
giving
--
giving
the
public
and
the
government
a
test,
a
legal
test
what's
the
difference
between
gifts
and
income
we've
undertaken
at
some
length
perhaps
on
due
length
in
our
briefs
to
–-
mr.
philip
elman
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
if
your
honors
will
--
will
clarify
the
rule
of
law
governing
these
facts,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
as
to
how
the
facts
would
square
with
--
with
the
rule
of
law.
i
think
even
under
the
--
under
the
test
that's
been
applied
by
the
lower
courts
here,
it's
clear
that
this
was
here
--
was
an
effect
with
quid
pro
quo
in
exchange
for
services
even
though
there
was
no
hope
or
expectation.
mr.
philip
elman
well
i
think
even
though
that
all
the
stockholders
agreed
to
it,
that
wouldn't
necessarily
establish
it
as
a
gift,
and
they
wouldn't
have
any
further
question
of
who
made
the
gift.
but
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
that
we
are
--
we're
not
putting
this
thing
in
terms
of
corporations
can't
make
gifts
for
tax
purposes.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
we're
saying
--
we're
saying
that
where
--
we're
saying
that
where
a
corporation
makes
a
gift
and
either
the
corporation
is
making
a
gift,
just
as
in
the
case
of
many
other
taxpayers,
you
have
to
decide
whether
the
reasons
which
prompted
the
gift,
the
inducing
force,
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
the
dominating
motive
was
a
proper
gift
reason
or
not.
and
we
think
in
the
case
of
a
corporation,
this
presumption
that
derives
not
from
the
federal
law
but
from
general
corporation
law
aids
the
trier
of
fact
in
making
that
determination.
that's
essentially
our
position.
we
point
this
out
simply
to
deal
with
the
--
deal
with
the
suggestion
that
if
you
look
to
the
reasons
why
the
gift
was
made,
you
have
to
cycle
analyze
and
do
that
all
kinds
of
things
that
is
impossible
and
so
on.
mr.
philip
elman
well
i
think
the
state
that
there's
a
donated
intent
in
all
these
cases
is
to
begin
the
problem
is
not
to
end
it,
because
in
every
cases
that's
in
the
book
something
the
tax
--
it
is
a
donative
intent
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
clear
that
intent
was
expressed
with
this.
the
(inaudible)
employer
says,
“i
intend
in
every
conceivable
way
that
this
shall
be
a
gift
for
all
purposes
and
still,
if
it's
--
if
he's
--
if
he
--
if
the
recipient
of
the
gift
is
a
100%
stockholder
of
the
corporation,
the
president
and
the
corporation
is
making
the
gift
in
one
of
these
cases,
the
president
has
a
74%
stockholder
and
he
--
and
he
voted
himself
a
wedding
gift
to
$7500.
there's
no
question
about
the
intention
to
make
a
gift,
it's
perfectly
clear.
but
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
don't
see
why
you
have
to
treat
that
as
a
sham,
and
then
they'd
be
put
in
--
the
corporation
is
expressing
a
genuine
intention
that
this
shall
be
a
gift.
there's
no
--
this
isn't
a
sham.
it's
a
gift
because
a
gift
as
the
courts
define
it
in
the
common
law
is
delivery
by
the
donor
accept
this
by
the
donee
plus
an
intention
of
making
a
gift.
mr.
philip
elman
the
intention
--
the
intention
i
think
is
probably
here
to
stay,
mr.
justice.
and
--
and
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
and
depend
--
mr.
philip
elman
well
i
think
that
academic
freedom
gives
more
than
that
(voice
overlap)
i
--
i
can't
--
mr.
philip
elman
well
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
our
point
on
that
would
be
that
while
the
intention
is
a
confusing
word,
it
appears
in
almost
every
area
of
the
law
and
whenever
it's
used,
it's
used
of
the
slightly
different
emphasis
--
mr.
philip
elman
we
have
to
use
it
because
the
supreme
court
has
used
it.
mr.
philip
elman
we
don't
think
it's
really
going
to
be.
it
will
be
hard
in
the
individual
case
which
won't
come
up
in
the
case
--
mr.
philip
elman
in
the
case
put
by
judge
learned,
if
i
may
continue
sentence.
mr.
philip
elman
in
the
hypothetical
case
put
by
judge
learned
hand
in
bogardus
case
that
the
patient
adding
something
to
the
bill
of
the
surgeon.
it
maybe
that
the
surgeon
has
just
not
adequately
appraised
the
value
of
its
services
and
the
--
and
the
patient
is
just
adding
something
on
to
it
just
as
the
client
add
something
to
the
lawyers
bill
and
it's
still
compensation
to
the
lawyer
or
the
doctor.
but
if
--
but
if
--
but
the
addition
is
made
out
of
feelings
of
affection
or
regard,
and
i
think
this
is
probably
more
vivid
and
in
relation
to
a
nurse
rather
than
a
doctor
who
has
rendered
[laughter]
services
to
a
patient
during
the
long
illness
where
feelings
of
affection
very
frequently
develop.
where
that
--
where
that
is
done,
you
may
have
a
difficult
question
of
fact,
but
you
don't
have
that
question
in
the
ordinary
corporate
situation
often
discussed,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
philip
elman
alright.
mr.
philip
elman
well
i
--
i
--
mr.
philip
elman
thank
you
(inaudible).
mr.
kusworm
referred
to
the
pot
o'
gold
case,
a
case
in
the
tax
court.
i
would
like
to
take
a
minute
to
discuss
the
problem
with
that
case
raised.
in
that
case
a
radio
show
picks
a
name
out
of
the
telephone
directory
at
random
and
called
you
up
if
you
are
home,
you
got
$900
and
the
tax
court
said,
“that
was
a
pure
case
of
the
recipient
receiving
something
for
nothing.
he
did
nothing
at
all
and
therefore
it
was
a
gift.”
now,
that
something
for
nothing
test
has
been
much
relied
upon
by
the
taxpayers
in
this
area
and
i
think
it
would
--
might
be
worthwhile
to
say
just
a
few
words
about
it.
it's
taken
from
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
reed
in
the
american
dental
case
in
318
u.s.,
which
was
a
cancellation
of
indebtedness
case.
and
that
case
itself
has
been
very
substantially
limited
if
not
overruled
in
the
subsequent
jacobson
case
where
mr.
justice
reed
dissented
on
the
ground
of
this
court,
it
was
being
overruled.
but
apart
from
that,
the
something
for
nothing
test
which
focuses
on
what
the
donee
did
is
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
intention
of
the
--
of
the
donor
to
make
a
gift
test.
intention
test
whatever
its
defects
as
a
formulation
that
at
least
focuses
the
inquiry
on
the
man
who
makes
--
who
makes
the
transfer
on
his
state
of
mind.
the
something
for
nothing
test
says,
well
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
the
intention,
motive
and
so
on
whether
it
was
a
selfish
interest,
business
interest.
if
the
man
who
receives
has
received
something
for
which
he
has
given
nothing,
then
to
him
it's
a
gift.
now
those
cases,
pot
o'
gold
and
similar
cases
were
all
decided
before
glenshaw.
in
the
glenshaw
case,
this
court
held
that
a
windfall
maybe
income.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
the
1954
code
does
take
care
of
prize
and
that
kind
of
a
prize
would
be
taxable,
but
we
think
the
pot
o'
gold
was
wrong
under
the
1939
code
for
the
simple
reason,
that
a
windfall
and
a
gift
are
not
synonymous.
in
pot
o'
gold
or
in
any
other
situation
where
somebody
has
received
something
for
nothing,
it's
a
windfall.
take
the
purest
case
of
a
windfall,
a
literal
case.
a
man
is
walking
down
the
street
and
the
wind
blows
a
hundred
dollar
bill
in
his
direction,
he
reaches
out,
puts
it
in
his
pocket,
he
looks
around,
there's
nobody
in
sight.
is
that
a
gift,
certainly
not?
its
not
even
a
gift
in
the
property
law
says
because
the
original
owner
of
the
bill
may
be
still
looking
for
it.
he's
not
intending
to
make
any
gift.
and
even

even
where
the
gift
again
in
quotation
mark
--
mr.
philip
elman
pardon?
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
--
i
can't
cite
any
cases
but
the
treasury
cases
(inaudible)
to
this
and
i
think
that
under
the
rationale
of
glenshaw
it's
income
then
it
is
certainly
not
a
gift.
mr.
philip
elman
if
it's
--
if
it's
kept
under
a
claim
of
right
and
is
unrestricted
use
in
enjoyment,
i
take
it
the
decision
of
this
court
say
it's
income.
now,
this
point
that
there
is
--
that
there
is
nothing
done
by
the
recipient
has
--
has
attributed
--
contributed
to
a
good
deal
of
confusion
in
this
area
particularly
in
the
widows
bonus
cases
because
there
the
widow
has
herself
not
rendered
any
services
and
the
courts
said,
well
she
hasn't
done
anything,
she's
--
it's
something
for
nothing
as
far
as
she
is
concerned.
and
the
courts
i
must
confess
have
been
--
have
been
seriously
rather
restraining
this
area
by
the
rulings
of
the
commissioner
himself
who
we
think
was
responsible
for
this
by
initially
making
an
erroneous
ruling
which
the
courts
followed
and
then
withdrawing
it
when
it
was
too
late.
now,
if
the
something
for
nothing
test
is
--
is
accepted,
as
i
say,
it
would
not
only
be
in
the
face
of
everything
--
of
all
the
case
law
in
this
field
which
focuses
on
the
situation
from
the
donors
our
position,
but
it
is
also
as
a
matter
of
analysis
wrong
because
it
confuses
gifts
and
windfalls.
thank
you
very
much.
