mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
that
court
set
aside
an
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission
finding
that
respondent
anheuser-busch
has
violated
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
which
prohibits
discriminations
in
price
between
purchasers
which
may
have
the
effect
of
substantially
lessening
or
injuring
competition
or
tending
to
create
a
monopoly.
the
respondent
which
makes
budweiser
beer
is
one
of
the
nation’s
leading
brewers.
in
the
beer
industry
of
the
united
states,
beers
or
brands
of
beer
are
divided
into
three
broad
classifications.
there
are,
first
of
all,
the
national
or
so-called
premium
brands
which
are
sold
in
every
market,
in
every
state
of
the
union
in
large
volume.
there
are
five
such
national
or
premium
brands.
budweiser,
made
by
the
respondent,
principally
in
--
in
st.
louis
brewery
and
the
four
milwaukee
beers,
millers,
schlitz,
blatz
and
pabst.
then
there
are
the
regional
beers
and
the
local
beers
which
as
the
terms
indicate
are
sold
not
nationally
but
in
more
limited
geographical
areas.
mr.
philip
elman
they're
known
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
there’s
no
suggestion
that
--
excuse
me.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
designation
premium
beers
is
attributable
to
the
fact
that
in
almost
every
market
in
the
united
states,
these
national
beers
are
sold
at
a
premium
price,
at
a
higher
price
than
the
regional
or
local
beers.
as
far
as
i
know,
there's
no
suggestion
that
they
are
premium
in
a
sense
of
superior
quality
or
anything
of
that
sort.
mr.
philip
elman
the
premium
is
in
relation
to
price.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
think
those
illusions
are
--
are
very
real
in
the
sense
that
they
affect
the
economics
of
this
industry.
as
the
commission
found,
the
reason
that
these
national
beers,
these
premium
beers
are
able
to
sell
at
a
profit,
in
large
volume,
in
almost
every
market
in
the
country
at
this
higher
price,
is
that
they
are
well
established
beers.
their
characteristics
are
well-known.
they
enjoy
excellent
reputations.
and
for
that
reason,
most
if
not,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
consumers
of
beer
are
willing
to
pay
a
few
cents
more
per
bottle
or
can
for
these
beers.
to
put
it
concretely
if
--
if
in
the
washington
area,
if
i
may
speak
on
the
basis
of
what
--
what
i
think
is
within
judicial
notice,
i
think,
if
--
if
i
walk
into
a
liquor
store,
if
i
see
that
the
price
of
budweiser
beer
per
case
is
about
the
same
as
the
price
of
valley
forge
or
national
bohemian,
i
mentioned
them
only
because
they're
local
beers
in
this
area
and
i
don't
mean
in
any
sense
to
--
to
depreciate
their
quality,
i
would
assume
that
most
people,
if
they
can
get
budweiser
at
the
same
price
as
these
other
regional
or
local
beers,
will
choose
budweiser.
by
the
same
token,
if
that
price
spread
is
eliminated
or
put
it
another
way,
if
the
price
spread
is
too
high,
if
you
have
to
pay
too
much
for
a
budweiser
or
schlitz
or
pabst,
the
consumer
may
bulk
at
that
point
so
that
there's
a
very,
very
close
relationship,
competitively,
in
the
industry
which
is
affected
by
the
illusion
to
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
referred
as
there's
a
sensitivity
of
consumer
reaction
which
is
affected
not
only
by
the
superior
premium
characteristics
of
the
--
of
the
beer
but
also
by
the
price.
now,
the
price
of
these
beers
is
not
uniform
throughout
the
country.
it
varies
depending
upon
local
market
factory
such
as
differences
in
the
cost,
the
distribution,
differences
in
the
cost
of
--
resulting
from
local
taxation,
regulation
and
so
on,
so
that
there
isn't
a
uniform
or
a
constant
price
for
the
beers
throughout
the
country.
but
as
the
commission
found,
there
is
this
price
differential
which
exists
in
almost
every
market
of
the
country.
the
--
the
national
beers
are
in
almost
every
area
of
the
united
states
sold
at
some
higher
price.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
generalize
with
any
degree
of
competencies
but
i
think
there's
--
there's
a
great
degree
of
flexibility
and
fluctuation
in
--
in
as
to
the
price
of
beers
that
the
only
thing
that
seems
to
be
relatively
constant
in
the
pricing
structure
is
the
existence
of
this
price
differential
between
the
national
beers
and
the
regional
and
local
beers.
and
as
the
commission
found,
if
that
differential
is
eliminated,
it
very
seriously
and
adversely
affects
the
ability
of
the
regional
beers
to
compete
with
the
national
because
the
consumer
if
he
--
if
he
is
not
influenced
by
this
price
consideration,
will
tend
in
the
direction
of
the
well-known
national
products.
mr.
philip
elman
excuse
me.
mr.
philip
elman
not
all.
there's
nothing
--
there's
not
--
certainly
nothing
illegal
in
a
--
in
a
brewer
to
charging
a
higher
price
if
he
can
get
it.
consumer
is
willing
to
pay
for
it,
nothing
at
all.
now,
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
your
honor
it's
--
your
honor,
it's
--
it's
opening
up
the
fact
to
this
particular
case
which
i'd
like
--
which
i
would
like
to
present
in
order
to
give
particular
--
particularity
to
some
of
the
generalizations
that
i
have
--
i've
--
i've
made.
now,
the
action
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
think
i
can
say
on
the
basis
of
this
record
that
their
--
that
the
prices
are
the
same.
i
think
there
is
--
there
is
competition,
to
the
extent
to
which
their
competition
among
them
has
--
has
resulted
in
--
in
price
variations
is
--
is
something
that
this
record
is
not
really
directed
to.
mr.
philip
elman
and
i
don't
think
it's
--
it's
important
in
this
case.
now,
this
case
involves
certain
price
reductions
which
the
respondent
budweiser,
anheuser
--
anheuser-busch
manufacturer
of
budweiser,
made
in
the
st.
louis
area,
in
1954,
which
had
the
effect
of
wiping
out
this
price
differential
between
its
beer
and
the
--
and
the
regionals.
now
there
are
--
there
were
three
regional
beers
in
st.
louis
which
were
respondents,
principal
competitors,
falstaff,
griesedieck
brothers
and
griesedieck
western
throughout
the
record,
these
latter
two
brewers
are
referred
to
by
their
initials
simply
as
gb
and
gw
and
i
think
perhaps
that
there's
---
it's
be
well
to
follow
that
example.
now,
these
three
regional
beers
were
sold
competitively
against
with
--
with
budweiser,
against
budweiser
not
only
in
the
st.
louis
market
but
in
almost
half
of
the
united
states,
if
not
more.
falstaff
competed
against
budweiser
in
26
states.
gb
competed
against
budweiser
in
13
states
and
gw
competed
with
budweiser
in
20
states.
and
some
of
the
13
and
20
states
were
not
included
in
the
26
states
in
which
falstaff
was
sold
so
that
in
a
very
large
area
of
the
country,
budweiser
was
competing
against
these
three
beers.
now,
in
st.
louis,
in
december
of
1953,
budweiser
was
selling
at
$2.93
a
case.
these
three
regional
beers
were
all
selling
at
the
same
price
of
$2.35
a
case.
there
was
a
price
spread
of
58
cents
a
--
a
case.
this
was
at
the
whole
of
30
--
wholesale
level,
budweiser,
respondent
to
its
price
to
the
retailers.
mr.
philip
elman
this
was
in
st.
louis.
now,
despite
the
fact
that
budweiser
was
selling
at
--
at
a
higher
price
in
st.
louis,
as
the
commission
found,
it
was
doing
quite
well
in
st.
louis.
sales
in
that
market
were
on
the
ascendancy.
it
was
slowly
but
steadily
increasing.
and
during
the
period
between
the
end
of
world
war
ii,
in
december
of
1953,
the
sales
of
budweiser
in
the
st.
louis
market
had
more
than
doubled.
in
1953,
this
is
all
by
way
of
background,
there
had
been
a
long,
bitterly
contested
strike
in
the
beer
industry.
that
strike
was
settled
in
august
of
1953.
and
as
a
result,
the
labor
cost
in
the
beer
industry
generally
had
increased.
consequently,
on
october
1,
1953,
all
of
the
national
brewers
raised
their
prices
of
beer,
generally,
throughout
the
country
except
for
two
states,
missouri,
where
st.
louis
is
located
and
wisconsin,
where
milwaukee
is
located
and
i
don't
know
whether
there's
any
significance
to
that
fact.
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
know
whether
there's
any
significance
to
that
fact
but
--
but
in
--
in
the
46
states,
other
than
missouri
and
wisconsin,
the
national
brewers
raised
their
prices.
the
historical
pattern
in
the
industry
is
that
when
the
nationals
raise
their
prices,
the
regionals
and
locals
followed
suit.
and
many
of
them
did
but
these
three
regionals
in
st.
louis
did
not
raise
their
prices.
so
that
in
all
of
the
areas,
not
only
st.
louis
or
i
should
say
the
part
from
st.
louis
where
there
had
been
no
increase,
but
in
all
the
areas,
other
than
st.
louis,
in
which
budweiser
was
in
competition
with
these
three
regional
beers,
the
failure
of
these
regionals
to
raise
their
price
had
the
effect
of
increasing
the
price
spread
between
the
--
their
beers
and
budweiser.
now,
against
this
background,
the
price
reductions
were
made.
now,
at
this
point
--
mr.
philip
elman
it
was
15
cents
a
case.
then
there
--
and
there
was
no
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
beg
your
pardon.
it
was
the
--
the
15
cents
increase
was
not
in
st.
louis,
it
was
in
the
46
states
of
the
union
other
than
missouri
and
wisconsin.
that
was
that
--
that
was
the
general
range
of
the
increase,
but
in
st.
louis,
budweiser
did
not
increase
its
price.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
in
the
other
area
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
but
not
in
st.
louis.
but
as
i
pointed
out,
they
were
competing
not
only
in
st.
louis
but
in
almost
half
of
it
or
more
than
half
of
the
country,
at
least
26
states.
now,
in
a
few
minutes,
i'm
going
to
discuss
the
question
as
to
the
light
which
is
shed
by
the
findings
and
the
evidence
as
to
whether
there
is
a
cause
and
effect
relationship
between
the
failure
of
these
three
regionals
to
go
along
and
raise
the
prices
of
their
beers
in
these
--
in
these
markets
and
the
price
reductions
in
st.
louis.
but
at
this
point,
i
just
want
to
state
the
objective
facts
of
the
record.
on
january
4th,
1954,
respondent
decreased
the
price
of
budweiser,
25
cents
a
case
from
$2.93
to
$2.68,
still
leading
a
differential
of
33
cents
but
the
three
regionals
were
still
selling
at
$2.35.
mr.
philip
elman
we're
in
st.
louis.
mr.
philip
elman
we're
in
st.
louis
where
--
where
incidentally
but
the
price
of
budweiser
was
the
lowest
in
the
country.
the
price
that
--
the
price
at
which
respondent
was
selling
budweiser
in
st.
louis
in
december
1953
before
all
these
occurred
was
$2.93.
the
lowest
price
that
it
was
charging
in
the
country,
the
high
was
los
angeles,
$3.80.
in
washington,
it's
$3.65.
but
st.
louis
was
the
lowest
price
in
the
country.
now,
it
is
also,
perhaps
the
significance
the
commission
thought
it
was,
that
as
a
result
of
the
increase
in
price
which
budweiser
and
the
other
nationals
had
made
in
october
of
1953,
budweiser's
sales
dropped
off
drastically.
again
illustrating
the
sensitivity
of
consumer
reaction
to
price
when
they
raised
the
prices
of
beer,
sales
fell
off
substantially.
in
december
of
1953,
budweiser'
sales
nationally
were
30%
below
the
preceding
year.
this
was
of
course
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
situation
in
st.
louis
where
budweiser
was
--
was
doing
very
well,
where
its
sales
were
going
up,
where
there
had
been
no
increase
in
price
as
a
result
of
this
strike
settlement.
now,
despite
the
fact
that
the
price
of
budweiser
in
st.
louis
was
the
lowest
in
the
country,
despite
the
fact
that
budweiser's
sales
were
--
were
on
the
increase
in
st.
louis,
despite
the
fact
that
that
was
the
one
area
in
the
country
where
the
company
was
making
money
and
not
losing
money,
the
respondent
reduced
its
prices
in
the
st.
louis
area.
first
as
i
say
on
january
4
in
the
amount
of
25
cents
and
then
on
june
4,
they
wiped
out
the
differential
entirely
bringing
their
price
down
to
$2.35,
exactly
matching
the
price
of
the
three
regionals.
now,
the
--
the
trial
examiner
found
and
his
findings
were
adopted
by
the
commission,
that
it
was
after
the
june
24,
1954
price
reduction
by
ab,
the
respondent,
that
the
roof
really
fell
in
on
the
st.
louis
market.
he
says
--
and
i'm
reading
now
from
his
findings
in
the
record
page
at
31,
“i
have
rarely
seen
such
a
dramatic
exhibition
of
economic
power
and
price
sensitivity
in
so
short
of
time."
apparently,
the
beer
--
beer
consuming
populous
in
the
st.
louis
market
equates
premium
quality
with
premium
price.
the
tremendous
switch
from
other
beers
to
budweiser
when
the
premium
price
was
eliminated
cannot,
on
this
record,
be
otherwise
accounted
for.
apparently,
also,
it
is
the
first
30
cents
or
less
of
--
of
premium
or
differential
in
price
which
touches
off
the
reaction
in
the
st.
louis
market.
he
then
gives
the
--
the
statistical
data
as
to
the
actual
effect
on
sales
during
this
period
in
1954
and
budweiser
sales,
for
example,
tripled
during
this
short
period.
the
--
there's
--
in
--
in
may
of
1954
they
--
their
--
their
share
of
--
of
the
total
was
15.5%,
the
next
month
22.6%,
in
july,
37.6%.
it
was
spectacular
the
way
that
the
--
the
few
cents
made
the
difference
in
--
in
the
competitive
situation
and
in
the
effect
in
sales.
and
of
course,
there
was
a
corresponding
decrease
in
the
--
in
the
sales
of
the
--
of
the
competitors.
the
principal
loss
is
being
suffered
by
gb
and
gw
rather
than
falstaff.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
four
nationals
were
in
there
but
apparently
in
--
in
st.
louis,
the
milwaukee
beers
don't
sell.
[laughter]
mr.
philip
elman
i
mean
their
--
their
share
of
the
market
was
almost
insignificant.
i
don't
know
whether
the
converse
is
true
milwaukee
but
certainly,
the
record
shows
that
they
--
they
were
insignificant
element
in
the
picture.
the
--
the
competition
there
was
between
these
--
were
among
the
st.
louis
brewers
because
these
three
--
regionals
all
have
the
breweries
in
st.
louis.
so
that
you
have
--
you
have
that
situation
there.
the
--
the
elimination
in
this
price
differential
apparently
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
and
the
commission
found
that
this
was
an
injury
to
competition
and
so
on
and
i
--
mr.
philip
elman
substantially
less
--
it's
substantially
--
its
effect
was
substantially
to
lessen
competition
intended
to
create
monopoly.
now,
the
words
to
the
statute.
now,
let
me
refer
to
the
specific
findings
as
to
--
on
the
issues
which
were
actually
in
controversy
before
the
commission.
before
the
commission,
there
was
no
disagreement
that
there
was
a
difference
in
price
between
budweiser
beer
in
st.
louis
and
price
charged
in
other
markets.
there
was
no
controversy
that
there
was
a
higher
price
charged
to
purchasers
and
other
markets.
there
was
no
inquiry
made
as
to
what
the
effects
of
the
lowering
of
price
in
st.
louis
may
have
been
on
the
customers
of
respondent
in
the
other
markets.
the
issues
that
were
framed
by
the
commission's
complaint
and
the
respondent's
answer
were
these.
was
there
really
an
injury
to
competition
as
a
result
of
these
price
reductions?
was
there
a
cause
of
relationship
between
the
reductions
in
the
injuries?
the
respondent
argued
that
these
--
its
competitors
suffered
these
losses
not
because
of
the
price
reductions
but
because
in
the
case
of
one
of
them,
its
product
was
inferior
in
the
case
of
the
other,
poor
business
management.
there
was
an
issue
tendered
as
to
the
meeting
of
competition,
in
meeting
of
--
of
the
lower
price
in
good
faith
in
section
2
(b)
defense
and
as
to
all
these
issues
to
resolve
against
the
respondent
by
the
commission.
the
main
factual
line
of
defense
was
that
in
st.
louis,
the
respondent
was
conducting
a
price
experiment.
they
were
faced
with
a
bad
situation.
their
losses
nationally
were
--
were
increasing.
their
sales
were
going
down.
and
in
order
to
find
out
what
was
the
trouble
and
what
they
could
do
about
it,
they
conducted
this
price
experiment
in
st.
louis.
they
conducted
it
incidentally
for
--
for
nine
months.
in
march,
1955,
budweiser
raised
its
price
from
$2.35
to
--
to
$2.65,
i
believe.
i
beg
your
pardon,
$2.80,
a
45
cents
increase.
and
almost
immediately
thereafter,
the
regionals
raised
their
price
15
cents
bringing
up
to
$2.50
so
they
retained
that
30
cents
differential.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
their
--
their
contention
on
the
fact
was
that
the
experiment
had
--
had
served
its
purpose
and
they
no
longer
had
to
pursue
it.
the
trial
examiner
said
that
the
experiment
proved
anything.
it
proved
that
they
could
--
they
could
solve
their
--
their
problem
by
lowering
their
prices
because
when
they
lowered
their
prices
in
st.
louis,
they
really
starting
to
sell.
and
he
expressed
skepticism
as
--
as
to
this
experiment
throughout
this
record.
at
one
point
after
another,
the
hearing
examiner
never
got
a
satisfactory
answer
of
this
one
question,
why
he
asked
them
if
we
were
--
if
we
were
troubled
about
your
--
your
national
picture.
your
sale
is
going
down
nationally.
why
--
if
you
--
if
your
sales
went
down
after
you
raised
your
prices
in
october
1953
elsewhere
but
in
st.
louis,
why
did
you
pick
st.
louis
to
conduct
this
price
experiment
of
reducing
your
prices
where
--
when
your
prices
in
st.
louis
where
the
lowest
in
the
country
and
when
you
had
no
--
no
problem
of
--
of
--
there
because
you
were
doing
very
well.
and
he
didn't
get
any
satisfactory
answer
to
that
question
until
the
testimony
of
the
respondent's
president
came
at
the
very
close
of
the
hearing,
after
all
the
evidence
was
in,
after
all
the
marketing
surveys
and
the
testimony
of
sales,
managers
and
so
on
was
in.
the
very
last
witness
in
the
case
was
called
by
the
commission
as
a
rebuttal
witness
and
that
was
mr.
august
a.
busch
jr.,
president
of
anheuser-busch.
and
i
should
like,
if
i
may,
to
read
his
testimony
because
he
testified
with
--
with
great
candor
and
it
seemed
--
it
seemed
to
the
trial
examiner
and
it
seems
to
us
to
be
very
illuminating
as
to
what
actually
took
place
in
this
case.
this
is
--
i'm
--
i'm
now
reading
from
volume
2,
page
934
and
mr.
busch
as
i
understand
as
a
commission
witness,
he's
being
examined
by
mr.
mayer,
counsel
for
the
commission.
and
page
934,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
mr.
mayer
says,
“the
national
shippers
increased
their
prices
after
the
settlement
of
the
brewer
strike
in
milwaukee
in
1953.
did
they
not
answer
in
october
1953?”
now
was
that
generally
true
of
all
the
brewers
throughout
the
country?
answer.
“no,
sir.”
for
the
first
time
i
think
in
the
history
of
the
brewing
industry,
when
the
large
shipping
brewers
increased
their
price
for
the
first
time,
as
i
recall
it
in
the
brewing
industry,
the
regionals
and
locals
in
some
areas
did
not
increase
their
price.
question,
“did
not
increase
their
price?”
that
is
correct.
question,
“in
some
of
these
regionals
and
locals
were
your
three
local
competitors
in
st.
louis,
falstaff,
gb
and
gw,
who
are
also
competing
with
you
in
the
state
of
texas?
were
they
not,
sir?”
answer,
“yes,
sir.”
then
on
page
935,
the
interrogation
continues,
mr.
--
mr.
busch
says
he
doesn't
see
any
connection.
this
is
the
--
by
the
third
of
the
way
down.
he
still
can't
see
any
connection
between
the
regionals
not
raising
their
prices
and
respondents
reducing
its
price
in
st.
louis.
he
says,
“i
still
can't
see
any
connection.
no,
our
adjustment
wasn't
made
over
what
they
were
going
to
do.”
and
then
he
says,
“i
imagine
we
wouldn't
have
done
anything,
had
they
raised,
to
be
perfectly
frank
and
honest
with
you.”
and
just
to
--
and
to
confirm
and
amplify
that,
mr.
mayer
on
page
938,
several
pages
--
state
in
the
record,
page
938
nailed
it
down.
question,
--
this
is
page
938,
the
fourth
line
down.
question,
“may
i
suggest
then,
sir,
that
the
failure
of
falstaff
and
griesedieck
brothers
and
griesedieck
western
have
business
sense
enough
in
your
opinion
to
increase
their
prices
after
the
settlement
of
the
milwaukee
strike
was
the
real
reason
for
the
price
reduction
of
budweiser
in
january
1954,
was
it
not?”
mr.
busch's
answer,
“competitive
wise,
certainly.”
now
the
trial
examiner
thought
that
mr.
--
mr.
philip
elman
this
is
page
938
of
the
record.
mr.
philip
elman
now,
mr.
--
now,
the
trial
examiner
as
appears
from
his
findings
on
page
40,
referring
to
this
testimony
of
respondent's
president,
he
thought
that
mr.
busch
had
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag.
but
mr.
busch
had
--
as
he
said,
“these
price
reductions
were
ordered
by
his
president
for
two
admitted
reasons,
to
get
business
away
from
its
competitors
and
to
punish
them
for
refusing
to
increase
prices
when
ab
did
so
in
the
fall
of
1953.
apparently,
the
lesson
was
well
taught
and
better
learned
because
those
three
st.
louis
breweries
properly
followed
ab
up
with
price
increases
in
march
1955
and
we're
careful
to
keep
the
price
difference
between
them
and
it
at
less
than
the
33
cents
whose
elimination
had
cost
them
so
much
sales
bargain.
mr.
philip
elman
this
--
i
was
just
reading
from
the
examiner's
finding
on
page
40
of
the
record.
now,
that
finding
was
--
was
adopted
by
the
commission.
the
commission
wrote
its
own
opinion
but
it
also
adopted
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
examiner.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
right.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
there's
no
question
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
findings
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
that
question,
although
the
respondent
did
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
these
findings
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
if
the
government
prevails
in
this
court,
the
case
will
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
on
in
remand,
that
question
will
be
opened.
i
set
forth
these
--
these
findings
because
there
is
some
difference
of
opinion
between
the
respondent
and
ourselves
as
to
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
and
we
believe
that
to
some
extent,
the
respondent
is
arguing
the
question
of
injury
or
the
competition
or
lessening
of
competition
or
a
tendency
of
monopoly,
that
aspect
of
the
case.
and
we
have
here
what
we
regard
as
an
injury
of
the
competition
through
a
price
reduction.
of
course,
ordinarily,
i
suppose
in
the
great
majority
of
cases,
the
price,
a
reduction
of
the
price
is
a
manifestation
of
--
of
a
vital
competitive
situation.
it
ordinarily
reflects
a
--
a
stimulus
to
competition.
but
in
this
case,
you
have
a
price
reduction
which
the
trial
examiner
found
was
for
the
purpose
of
punishing
competitors
who
did,
to
lower
their
prices
in
effect,
by
maintaining
prices
when
they're
--
when
respondent
and
the
other
nationals
were
increasing
theirs.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
indeed.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
indeed.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
mr.
justice,
if
i
may
answer
your
question
this
way.
i
think
you're
raising
a
--
a
very
serious
question
as
to
the
scope
of
the
meeting
competition
--
meeting
the
lower
price
of
the
competitor
in
good
faith
defense
which
is
one
of
the
defenses
here.
it
was
--
it's
--
it's
--
it
was
not
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
that
questions
of
that
sort
ought
not
to
be
considered
by
this
court.
they
weren't
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
reached
by
it.
but
let
me
say
this
by
way
of
an
answering
the
context
of
--
of
your
honors'
review
of
this
case.
you
have
here
a
difference
of
price
between
the
st.
louis
market
and
the
other
markets
of
the
country.
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
the
--
the
argument
which
was
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
respondent,
not
in
its
petition
for
review,
didn't
raise
this
question
in
its
--
in
presenting
the
appeal
for
the
court
of
appeals,
but
on
its
reply
brief.
for
the
first
time
in
this
case,
the
argument
was
made
that
it
is
essential
prerequisite
for
a
violation
of
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
which
speaks
of
discriminations
in
price
that
there'd
be
a
discrimination
and
you
cannot
discriminate
between
two
people
unless
the
effect
is
to
help
one
and
hurt
the
other
and
that
in
this
case,
budweiser
wasn't
discriminating
among
its
competitors
in
st.
louis.
it
was
treating
them
all
alike.
the
price
reductions
that
it
made
in
st.
louis
were
uniform.
it
wasn't
discriminating
among
its
customers
in
st.
louis.
they
all
paid
the
same
price
so
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“so
far
as
st.
louis
is
concerned,
there's
no
discrimination.
if
there
is
any
discrimination,
it
has
to
be
against
the
--
the
purchasers
of
respondent
and
these
other
markets
of
the
country.”
but
says
the
court
of
appeals,
“these
customers
in
other
markets
aren't
competing
with
the
--
the
retailers
of
budweiser
in
st.
louis.
there's
no
competitive
relationship
between
them.”
now,
if
there's
no
competitive
relationship
between
them,
they
aren't
heard.
and
if
they
aren't
heard,
by
definition,
the
essence
of
discrimination
is
that
somebody
is
--
is
benefitted
and
somebody
else
is
injured.
there's
no
injury
to
them.
therefore,
there's
--
there's
no
discrimination.
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
there
has
to
be
some
relationship
between
the
people
allegedly
discriminated
against,
entitling
them
to
the
same
prices.
and
if
there's
no
relationship
here,
between
respondent's
purchasers
in
st.
louis
and
its
purchasers
in
other
areas
and
that
we
--
we
can
see
that
they're
not
in
--
there's
no
competition
between
the
people,
the
retailers
who
buy
from
respondent
in
los
angeles
or
(inaudible)
--
and
--
and
those
at
--
retailers
in
st.
louis
there's
no
--
certainly
not
that
relation
and
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
--
that
indicates
that
budweiser
passed
on
any
losses
it
may
have
suffered
in
st.
louis
to
its
purchasers
in
other
markets
in
the
form
of
a
higher
price.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
indicates
that
they
did
very
well
in
st.
louis.
they
were
operating
profitably.
there
weren't
any
losses,
so
far
as
we
know.
we
certainly
--
the
--
the
commission
didn't
attempt
to
present
any
evidence
of
that
sort
and
the
respondent
made
no
effort
to
raise
any
issue
as
to
whether
there
was
any
injury
to
competition
other
--
outside
the
st.
louis
area.
in
other
words,
no
issue
was
tendered
before
the
commission
based
upon
the
contention
that
in
order
to
have
a
discrimination
between
purchasers
in
different
markets,
not
only
did
you
have
to
show
injury
to
competition
in
the
market
in
which
the
price
cut
is
made
to
the
competitors
of
the
seller,
but
that
you
also
had
to
show
that
there
was
some
injury
to
competition
in
other
markets.
that
issue
was
not
raised
in
--
and
nevertheless,
it
was
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
that
the
words
“discrimination
and
price”
require
that
as
an
essential
condition
defining
a
violation
of
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
that
there'd
be
adverse
economic
effects
upon
the
purchasers
and
other
markets
who
pay
the
higher
price.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
as
we
read
the
opinion,
the
court
in
effect
seems
to
say
that
because
there
was
--
it
--
it
assumed
that
the
--
the
correctness
of
the
commission's
findings.
it
says
in
the
opinion,
“even
if
--
even
if
these
price
reductions
in
st.
louis
were
directed
at
respondent's
competitors
there,
even
if
they
were
predatory.”
that
was
the
commission's
word
in
its
brief,
which
the
court
of
appeals
adopted.
nonetheless,
there
was
no
violation
of
section
2.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
the
facts
of
this
case
really
fell
within
section
3,
the
criminal
provision
of
--
of
robinson-patman
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
charge
a
lower
price
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
or
eliminating
a
competitor
so
that
on
the
view
of
the
facts,
which
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
for
purposes
of
its
decision,
the
price
reductions
in
st.
louis
may
be
assumed
to
be
predatory.
they
may
be
assumed
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
respondent's
competitors.
they
may
be
assumed
to
be
a
--
as
bad
as
you
like,
but
under
the
view
of
the
statute,
which
the
court
of
appeals
adopted,
doesn't
make
any
difference.
what
happens
in
st.
louis
is
you
can't
show
some
injury
to
the
respondent's
customers
in
other
markets.
there's
no
discrimination
because
the
discrimination
is
between
purchasers.
now,
our
brief
elaborates
in
some
detail
the
various
reasons
which
--
which,
we
think,
could
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
a
most
unreal
artificial
construction
of
the
statute.
the
statute
it
--
itself
defines
what
makes
a
price
difference
and
illegal
discrimination.
the
--
this
isn't
--
we're
not
dealing
here
with
discrimination
in
the
abstract.
the
discrimination
is,
of
course,
a
--
a
differentiation
of
treatment
which
when
judged
by
a
controlling
standard
it
--
it
is
as
unjustified
and
that
we
don't
have
to
speculate
in
the
abstract
as
to
what
the
standard
for
determining
when
a
price
difference
is
an
illegal
prohibition
under
section
2
because
section
2
which
we
have
set
forth
in
full
in
our
--
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
on
pages
14
and
15.
section
2
defines
its
own
standards.
it's
a
--
that
the
--
the
entire
section
is
--
is
contained
in
a
single
sentence.
it
starts
at
the
top
of
page
14
of
our
brief.
it
goes
all
the
way
down
to
the
middle
of
page
15.
the
court
is
very
familiar
with
section
2.
it's
had
it
in
many
cases
and
your
honors
know
that
in
this
one
single
sentence,
congress
packed
the
four
provisos,
three
or
four
conditions,
semicolons,
colons,
and
--
and
you
cannot
do
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here,
pick
out
one
word,
“discriminate”
and
disregard
the
rest
of
the
sentence
and
speculate
as
to
what
congress
meant
by
“discriminate.”
the
statute
said
that
the
discrimination
is
really
a
different
--
a
difference
in
price
really
is
a
discrimination
and
illegal
where
the
effect
of
such
discrimination
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
in
any
line
of
commerce,
any
line
of
commerce
or
to
injure,
destroy,
or
prevent
competition
with
any
person
who
either
grants,
that's
the
seller,
who
either
grants
or
knowingly
receives
the
benefit
of
such
discrimination
or
with
customers
of
either
of
them.
so
that
under
the
statute,
there's
no
question
at
all.
the
respondent
doesn't
deny
it.
that
an
injury
to
the
competition
of
the
seller
who
charges
the
lower
price
is
--
is
sufficient.
now,
the
--
it's
clear
as
the
--
as
your
honors
know
that
the
--
the
whole
purpose
of
--
of
the
original
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
in
1914
was
to
protect
the
--
the
competitors
of
--
of
sellers.
the
legislative
history
and
the
cases
under
section
2
of
the
1914
act
showed
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
protect
were
the
--
whether
--
whether
the
--
the
businessmen
in
--
in
one
area
who
were
faced
with
--
with
a
--
a
giant
national
corporation
coming
into
that
area
and
lowering
its
price
to
the
point
where
the
--
where
the
local
people
just
can't
--
can't
compete.
mr.
philip
elman
not
at
all.
no,
no.
mr.
philip
elman
no.
i'm
--
i'm
presenting
the
--
the
findings
of
the
commission
which
show
not
that
this
is
a
case
comparable
to
the
ones
in
the
house
committee
report,
the
clayton
act
of
the
american
tobacco
company,
standard
oil
of
indiana
walking
into
an
area,
new
area
driving
the
local
people
out
of
it.
they
were
in
there,
but
if
these
findings
be
upheld
as
we
will
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
should
be
upheld
when
the
case,
as
we
hope,
goes
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand.we
would
--
we
would
argue
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
seller's
competition
has
been
“substantially
lessened,”
a
tendency
to
monopoly
and
that
line
of
commerce
has
been
created
by
reason
of
a
--
of
a
price
reduction,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
showing
that
the
price
reductions
could
well
have
the
effect.
as
the
trial
examiner
found
he
said
there
was
a
distinct
probability
if
these
price
cuts
--
these
--
these
price
cuts
continue,
that
the
regionals
might
be
eliminated
as
competitors.
now,
of
course,
in
this
case
that
didn't
happen.
it
didn't
happen,
but
section
2
isn't
directed
to
the
situation
where
there's
a
distraction
of
competitors.
section
2
as
you
--
as
you
have
held
in
a
number
of
cases
is
like
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
you're
dealing
with
your
--
congress
was
dealing
here
with
potential
monopolistic
practices.
section
2
is
directed
at
pricing
practices
which
if
allowed
to
attain
full
maturity
would
have
a
very
severe
and
distractive
effect
upon
our
competitive
economy.
so
that's
--
so
--
so
far
as
section
2
is
concerned,
all
that
the
commission
is
required
to
find
is
that
the
--
the
price
reductions
have
those
effects.
now,
of
course,
to
all
these
defenses
are
--
in
the
--
in
the
various
provisos
of
--
of
the
act
available
and
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
court
of
appeals
as
we
read
its
opinion
is
saying,
“you
cannot
have
a
price
discrimination
between
different
purchasers
unless
they're
really
competing
with
each
other.”
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
if
--
if
the
court
of
appeals
means
that
if
you
charge
a
uniform
price
to
all
of
the
purchasers
in
one
market
and
that
--
that's
no
discrimination.
then
the
court
of
appeals,
it
has
in
effect
repealed
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
because
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
and
all
the
cases
under
it
make
it
clear
that
there
can
be
in
the
jargon
of
the
anti-trust
(inaudible)
territorial
price
discrimination.
oh,
i'm
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
if
it
means
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
if
it
means
--
if
it
means
that
there's
no
discrimination
so
long
as
you
charged
the
same
price
in
one
area
then
of
course
it's
clearly
wrong.
if
it
means
--
if
it
means
there
has
to
be
a
competitive
relationship
to
the
purchasers
in
another
area,
i
think
even
respondent
would
agree
that
that's
clearly
wrong.
now
the
respondent
says
that
we
--
we
have
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
because
he
finds
in
the
quotation
of
a
--
of
a
statement
made
by
representative
utterback
who
was
the
manager
of
the
house
bill
that
became
the
robinson-patman
act,
an
implicit
holding,
implicit
recognition
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
where
the
price
reduction
in
one
area
is
in
effect
passed
on
to
the
customers
in
other
areas,
but
the
losses
suffered
as
a
result
of
that
price
reduction
are
passed
on
in
the
form
of
a
higher
price,
the
customers
in
other
areas
so
that
in
that
situation
there
is
an
injury
to
--
to
purchasers
in
other
markets.
respondent
says,
“that's
really
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
as
a
matter
of
law,”
and
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
allegation
to
prove
them
for
that
reason.
the
commission
said
that
--
the
commission's
order
was
set
aside.
now,
we
don't
think
that's
the
right
--
we
don't
--
we
don't
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
way,
but
even
if
the
respondent
is
right.
if
--
if
that's
really
what
the
court
of
appeals
held,
it
would
still
be
wrong
because
it
would
still
mean
that
no
matter
what
a
seller
did
to
his
competition
in
one
market,
no
matter
with
what
purpose,
no
matter
with
what
effects
on
that
competition,
that
competition
of
the
sellers
might
be
destroyed,
it
would
still
have
to
make
some
kind
of
a
showing
that
there
was
an
injury
to
the
purchasers
in
other
markets
and
there's
--
there
have
--
that
the
clayton
act
has
been
on
the
books
now
for
four
--
some
46
years.
there
have
been
many
cases.
i
don't
know
of
a
single
case
in
--
which
--
which
says
or
even
implied
that
you
have
to
make
two
--
two
--
you
have
to
show
two
injuries
to
the
competition.
one
in
the
area
in
which
the
price
cut
is
made
and
another
injury
to
competition,
competition
of
other
purchasers
in
other
areas.
there
have
been
--
the
number
of
those
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court.
the
--
the
issue,
of
course,
was
not
presented,
but
the
--
these
cases
have
been
before
a
number
of
circuits
and
there
is
not
one
case
which
holds
that
you
look
beyond
the
area
in
which
the
price
cut
which
is
made.
that
you
don't
have
to
find
--
there's
no
case
that
says
you
have
to
look
and
see
whether
the
purchasers
who
are
charged
at
a
higher
price
in
other
markets
are
also
injured
by
it.
and
we
think
that
if
--
if
representative
utterback's
rather
ambiguous
language
is
read
as
--
as
meaning
that
it
--
it
really
attributes
irrationality
to
the
robinson-patman
act
which
was
intended
to
expand
the
protections
of
the
clayton
act,
not
to
restrict.
congress
in
1936
in
the
robinson-patman
act
added
section
3
which
your
honors
are
familiar
with.
it
was
before
you
in
the
nashville
milk,
carnation
and
safeway
cases
a
couple
of
years
ago.
section
3
is
the
criminal
provision
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
charge
a
lower
price
or
an
unreasonably
low
price
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
competitors.
now,
if
--
if
congress
makes
it
a
crime
in
1936
to
--
to
charge
a
lower
price
in
one
area
for
that
purpose,
it's
--
it's
incredible
that
it
should
want
to
take
away
from
the
federal
trade
commission
the
power
to
deal
administratively
with
--
with
such
pricing
practices,
practices
which
were
clearly
forbidden
by
the
clayton
act.
it
would
mean
that
--
that
the
competitors
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
seller
who
makes
these
price
discriminations
don't
have
any
remedy
of
damages
as
was
held
in
a
national
case.
it's
just
a
crime,
but
you
can't
--
you
can't
--
the
federal
trade
commission
can't
try
to
nip
the
thing
in
the
bud
with
a
cease
and
desist
order
and
the
people
who
are
hurt
by
it
can't
sue
for
trouble
damages.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
--
the
--
so
the
far
as
the
interstate
commerce
aspect
is
concerned
here,
your
decision
in
the
moore
against
mead's
bread
case
in
348
u.s.
covers
it
where
there's
a
--
you
got
into
intrastate
commerce
which
bears
the
brunt
of
the
discrimination
and
it's
--
and
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
and
the
other
markets
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
philip
elman
it's
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
it's
immaterial
for
purposes
of
showing
a
discrimination
or
injury
to
competition,
but
it's
certainly
immaterial
in
showing
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
elman
jurisdiction
isn't
challenged.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
that
is
not
the
whole
argument.
the
whole
argument
--
the
whole
argument
is
that
it's
--
it
--
it
hinges
--
mr.
philip
elman
certainly.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
--
the
--
on
--
on
the
commission
--
on
the
commission's
findings,
the
purpose
of
this
price
reduction
was
to
punish
these
three
regionals
who
did
business
all
over
the
country
or
--
or
in
a
large
part
of
the
country,
but
who
happened
to
be
doing
business
in
st.
louis
also
because
that
was
their
--
their
home
--
home
base.
they're
being
punished
because
of
their
failure
to
go
along
with
the
price
increases
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
in
these
other
areas.
mr.
philip
elman
now,
if
that
is
an
impact
on
commerce,
i
don't
know
what
--
commerce,
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
--
mr.
philip
elman
we
don't
say
that
you
need
look
at
the
effect
outside
of
st.
louis
for
purposes
of
determining
the
--
the
effect
on
commerce.
what
we're
saying
is
in
determining
whether
there's
a
discrimination,
it's
enough
to
show
that
outside
st.
louis
in
interstate
commerce
markets,
one
price
was
charged
and
in
saint
louis,
another
price
was
charged
then
that
--
that
differential
comes
within
all
of
the
conditions
and
all
the
provisos,
etcetera
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
philip
elman
there
are
competitive
relations
not
only
in
st.
louis
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
and
outside
saint
louis
are
affected.
mr.
philip
elman
why,
yes,
because
--
because
if
--
if
a
price
reduction
in
st.
louis
is
made
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
them
in
the
future
from
--
from
lowering
their
--
from
--
from
the
regionals
lowering
their
prices
in
other
territories,
that
certainly
affects
competition.
mr.
philip
elman
that
will
be
one
of
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
there
are
findings
--
there
are
findings
by
the
--
the
examiner
which
i've
read
that
that
the
--
that
was
the
--
the
purpose
was
punitive
to
punish
them
for
not
going
along
and
that's
going
to
be
one
of
the
questions
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
--
the
--
there's
a
finding
here
that
this
was
continued.
it
might
drive
them
out
of
business,
it
drove
them
out
of
business,
would
drive
them
out
of
business,
all
of
them,
not
just
in
st.
louis.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
the
court,
please,
though
the
argument
has
covered
a
broad
ground,
i
believe
that
the
issue
actually
presented
to
this
court
for
a
decision
is
rather
narrow
is
a
very
important
one.
and
that
issue
is
the
correctness
of
the
construction
of
the
statute
which
was
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
very
threshold
of
the
appeal
and
on
the
basis
of
its
disposition
of
that
question
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
issues
which
were
actually
presented
for
review
in
the
petition
for
review
of
the
respondent.
there
were
issues
as
to
whether
the
findings
as
to
injury
to
competition
were
adequately
sustained
by
the
evidence,
whether
there
was
a
--
the
respondent
had
established
the
meeting
competition
in
good
faith
defense
but
the
commission's
order
was
too
broad.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
its
opinion
which
appears
in
volume
3
of
the
record
starting
at
page
1550,
assumes
without
upholding
but
it
assumes
the
findings
of
the
commission
that
there
was
such
an
injury
to
competition
as
required
by
section
2.
it
assumes
the
correctness
of
those
findings
without
examining
them.
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
accepted
as
a
premise
of
its
decision
that
this
was
a
quote,
“predatory
pricing
practice.”
it
assumed
that
it
was
directed
at
respondent's
competitors.
it
said,
“notwithstanding,
those
findings
of
injury
to
competition
in
the
st.
louis
market,
that
there
was
no
discrimination
because
there
was
no
discrimination
between
purchasers
there
could
be
no
violation
of
section
2,”
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
has
to
be
a
relationship
between
the
purchasers
who
had
charged
the
different
prices
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
discrimination.
it
says
that
where
two
purchases
from
a
seller
are
competing
with
each
other,
that
competition
creates
a
relationship
that
entitles
them
to
comparable
treatment
as
to
the
price.
it
also
quoted
the
statement
of
representative
utterback
as
to
the
prices
being
so
low
as
to
involve
a
sacrifice
of
--
of
profits
and
costs
that
made
up
in
a
higher
price.
from
that
statement,
the
respondent
finds
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
limit
its
holding
of
a
relationship
to
situation
where
are
there
are
competing
customers,
but
it
also
--
it
may
exist
according
to
respondent's
reading
between
non
competing
customers
if
there
is
a
sale
at
so
low
a
price
that
it
affects
the
purchaser
in
another
area,
a
non
competing
purchaser
who
pays
the
higher
price.
that's
a
very
narrow
construction
of
the
statute,
but
it
is
an
extremely
important
one
because
if
that
is
accepted
in
our
view,
it
(inaudible)
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
of
1914
as
it
was
incorporated
and
broadened
by
the
robinson-patman
act
in
1936.
it
would
require
a
showing
not
only
that
there'd
be
an
injury
even
if
the
injury
would
be
a
complete
destruction
of
the
seller's
competition
in
the
market
of
the
price
cut
that
would
not
be
enough.
you
would
also
have
to
show
a
relationship
to
the
purchasers
and
other
markets
paying
the
higher
price.
that
relationship,
mr.
barton
conceded
in
response
to
the
questions
from
the
bench
would
be
established
if
there
was
a
purpose
to
destroy
competitors.
now,
i
cannot
understand
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
--
and
i
don't
see
how
the
existence
of
a
purpose
in
one
market
to
destroy
the
competitors
of
the
sellers
in
that
--
of
the
seller
in
that
market
has
anything
to
do
with
the
purchasers
in
the
other
markets
who
pay
the
higher
price
and
i
think
it
was
for
that
reason
that
he
was
somewhat
reluctant
to
concede
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
statute
because
if
you
need
a
relationship
between
purchasers,
clearly
the
--
the
existence
of
the
predatory
purpose
assuming
the
facts
are
required
which
is
of
course
another
question
that,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
relationship
to
the
purchasers
in
the
other
areas.
similarly,
he
said
it
does
not
have
to
be
a
reduction
below
cost
and
he
conceded
in
response
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
that
if
it
was
below
the
normal
profit,
that
that's
a
violation
--
that
could
also
be
a
violation
but
that
also
could
indicate
a
relationship.
we
--
we
don't
see
how
even
a
reduction
below
cost
in
one
area
has
anything
to
do
with
the
price
in
another
area
unless
it'd
be
assumed
as
a
matter
of
law
that
whenever
a
seller
reduces
his
prices
in
one
area,
it
necessarily
comes
out
as
either
it's
capital
or
it's
profits
or
whatever
he
--
he
makes
from
his
business
all
over
the
country.
we
--
if
--
if
the
statute
is
to
be
interpreted
as
meaning
to
federal
trade
commission
or
a
plaintiff
in
a
private
treble
damage
action
who
was
injured
by
--
by
this
kind
of
a
practice
has
to
make
present
cost
accounting
date
to
show
that
that
lawsuit
had
actually
been
incurred
by
the
seller
when
he
reduces
his
price
for
a
discriminatory
purpose.
and
that
he
has
actually
passed
them
on
to
the
purchasers
in
the
other
market
we
think
that
is
the
--
that
--
that
the
clayton
act
has
been
substantially
appealed.
mr.
philip
elman
no
that
is
the
government's
--
that's
not
the
commission's
position.
it
never
has
been
the
commission's
position.
in
this
very
case
prior
to
january
1954
there
were
different
prices
for
budwiser
all
over
the
country.
the
commission
has
never
challenged
the
existence
of
different
prices.
mr.
philip
elman
the
standard
is
whether
the
lowering
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
standard
--
the
standard
of
the
--
of
--
of
the
statute
is
whether
the
--
the
lower
price
has
the
effect
of
substantially
lessening
competition
or
injuring,
destroying
or
preventing
competition
or
tending
to
create
a
monopoly
and
does
not
come
within
the
provisos
as
to
--
with
giving
the
--
the
fact
the
respondent
before
the
commission
the
defense
of
fluctuating
market
conditions,
cost
justification,
meeting
competition
in
good
faith
and
so
on,
but
beyond
all
that
mr.
justice,
beyond
the
explicit
provisos
the
whole
purpose
of
section
2
which
--
which
has
to
be
considered
in
construing
it
is
that
it
was
intended
to
prevent
injuries
to
competition,
destructions
of
a
competition
in
any
action.
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
think
that
the
--
that
that
is
--
that
it's
really
an
accurate
statement
of
commission's
position.
that
--
that
you
have
here
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
if
your
--
your
honor
you
will
read
the
trial
examiner's
opinion
here
which
the
commission
adopted
and
it
added
to
it
its
own
opinion,
because
you
read
the
two
of
them
together
if
you
also
read
--
i
--
i
hesitate
to
add
to
your
burden
sir,
but
just
--
to
understand
the
commission's
position
in
this
classification
is
you
not
only
have
to
read
what
it
--
it
--
it
said
here,
you
have
to
read
what
it
said
in
cases
like
the
--
the
general
foods
case
and
the
pure
(inaudible)
case
and
from
--
from
the
whole
context
of
federal
trade
commission
action
in
this
field,
it
seems
to
me
it's
wholly
unjustified
to
--
to
attribute
to
the
commission
a
position
which
we
denied
in
our
reply
brief
that
any
difference
in
price
is
a
price
discrimination.
mr.
philip
elman
there
has
to
be
an
injury.
mr.
philip
elman
there
has
to
be
--
mr.
philip
elman
well
in
its
brief
in
this
court
the
respondent
has
quoted
for
on
page
17
of
anheuser-busch's
brief,
they
have
quoted
from
a
statement
of
the
commission
and
its
policy
towards
geographic
price
of
things
which
you
have
it
here
and
we
--
we
--
they
say
if
i
may
take
the
time
with
you,
injury
to
competition
which
one
seller
imposes
upon
another
raises
a
few
problems
since
it
is
a
conception
which
can
be
traced
back
to
the
beginnings
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it
usually
arises
when
the
discriminating
seller
quotes
lower
prices
to
the
customers
of
his
competitors
in
such
a
way,
in
such
a
way
--
in
such
a
way
that
he
jeopardizes
the
continuance
of
effective
competition
by
these
competitors
and
thus
tends
to
acquire
a
monopoly
of
the
commodity
sold,
except
where
such
a
tendency
toward
monopoly
appears
the
commission
did
not
regard
an
effort
to
get
business
from
a
competitor
by
sporadic
--
sporadic
price
reductions
as
illegally
injurious
to
that
competitor,
they
don't
use
the
word
predatory.
but
i
think
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
statute
is
--
is
without
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
that
in
almost
every
case
were
the
commission
finds
that
there
is
an
injurious
destructive
effect
on
competition
or
a
monopolistic
tendency
the
evidence
upon
which
that
kind
of
finding
has
to
be
predicated
would
exclude
a
legitimate
normal
competitive
purpose
of
just
striving
to
get
a
business
with
expected
competitors.
mr.
philip
elman
of
course
and
that
--
and
whether
it's
supported
by
evidence
in
this
case
is
question
which
will
be
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand
if
the
court
so
–-
mr.
philip
elman
yes
that's
the
commission's
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
difference
in
price
and
the
elimination
of
the
price
differential
between
the
national
beer,
premium
beer
and
the
regional
beer
gets
you
--
has
the
hurdle
of
a
discrimination.
it
does
not
get
you
past
the
hurdle
of
substantially
lessening
competition
tending
to
a
monopoly
etcetera,
etcetera.
the
commission's
--
the
commission
certainly
cannot
find
an
illegal
discrimination
from
the
fact,
the
mere
fact
of
the
difference
in
price.
it
has
to
show
these
consequences
so
far
as
the
process
of
competition
is
concerned,
that's
in
the
statute.
mr.
philip
elman
they
also
have
proviso
–-
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right,
and
in
the
effect,
the
effect
qualifies,
modifies
and
gives
substance
and
color
to
the
--
to
what's
discrimination.
mr.
philip
elman
but
we
did
not
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
us
to
ask
your
honor
to
review
those
questions
or
for
us
to
argue
them
here
under
the
--
under
the
well
established
practice
of
the
court.
you've
got
here
a
--
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
an
initial
question
of
statutory
construction
which
on
its
view
made
it
unnecessary
to
reach
all
the
questions
that
were
--
that
were
the
subject
matter
of
these
1500-page
record
before
the
commission.
the
issues
before
the
court
of
appeals
are
not
just
simple
issues
of
law.
you've
got
here
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
has
pointed
out,
a
very
imprecise
kind
of
statute.
you've
got
findings
of
fact
which
are
--
are
contested
as
being
without
evidentiary
support
that
their
arguments
--
that
the
findings
made
by
the
examiner
are
not
really
the
findings
of
the
commission.
you
have
the
arguments
here
as
to
the
scope
of
the
commission's
order
and
whether
they're
--
there
are
provisos
of
the
statute
that
are
implicit.
it
should
be
explicit
and
so
on.
it's
a
--
all
--
there's
a
--
there's
a
range
of
--
of
questions
that's
--
that's
presented
and
argued
in
the
--
in
the
brief
for
the
respondent
which
we
would
--
we
would
be
very
glad
to
have
the
court
consider
them
and
it
isn't
for
any
fear
that
this
court
is
any
less
favorable
a
forum
for
us
than
the
court
of
appeals,
we
don't
argue
that.
thank
you.
