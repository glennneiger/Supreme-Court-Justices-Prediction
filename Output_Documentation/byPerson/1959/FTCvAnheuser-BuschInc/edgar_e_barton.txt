mr.
edgar
barton
yes,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
certain,
alice
in
wonderland
about
this
argument.in
the
commission
proceeding,
there
was
no
finding
by
the
commission
that
anheuser-busch
engaged
in
any
punishment
of
competitors
in
st.
louis
when
it
made
this
price
reduction.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
in
january
of
1954,
in
response
to
the
urgent
competitive
conditions
which
have
been
alluded
to
losses
of
as
much
as
60%
and
80%
of
sales
in
various
states
throughout
the
midwest.
anheuser-busch
did
reduce
its
price
in
st.
louis
by
this
specified
amount.
it
didn't
bring
the
prices
down
to
the
competitor's
prices.
they
were
still
33
cents
above.
and
despite
the
fact
that
it
reduced
its
prices
in
st.
louis
in
january
to
get
a
little
closer
to
the
competitor's
prices,
the
sales
results
were
minimal.
nothing
happened.
sales
didn't
increase.
in
july
--
in
june
of
1954,
it
did
reduce
its
price
to
equal
the
competitor's
price
in
st.
louis.
in
other
words,
they
all
sold
for
$2.35
to
the
retailer.
now,
before
the
examiner,
when
mr.
busch
was
called
to
testify,
they
missed
--
the
examiner
misunderstood
the
facts
of
the
case.he
thought
that
ab
had
raised
its
price
in
st.
louis
when
it
raised
outside
of
st.
louis
in
october
of
1953.
and
he
thought
that
the
reason
for
the
reduction
of
price
by
anheuser-busch
in
st.
louis
was
because
falstaff
and
the
others
had
not
raised
their
price
in
st.
louis
when
ab
raised
its
price.
now,
we
outlined
in
fully,
on
our
brief
on
pages
45
through
47
the
facts
regarding
--
what
i
regard
as
the
--
this
crucial
question
in
the
case.
if
we
were
guilty
of
punishing
competitors
by
our
price
reduction,
we
don't
believe
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
held
that
we
did
not
discriminate
in
price
when
we
lowered
prices
in
st.
louis.
this
issue
was
fully
talked
out
before
the
court
of
appeals
half,
a
good
part
of
the
argument
was
devoted
to
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
obviously
held
that
we
did
not
have
this
purpose
when
we
lowered
prices.
now,
i
would
point
out
further
that
even
though
the
examiner
states
what
he
states
in
his
--
his
proposed
findings,
it
is
significant
that
the
commission
made
no
mention
of
this
whatsoever
in
his
opinion.
now,
what
in
fact
happened
was
that
when
we
got
before
the
commission,
we
pointed
out
that
the
examiner
had
been
in
error
with
respect
to
his
facts
in
our
briefs
to
the
commission.
and
commission
counsel
on
argument
before
the
commission,
conceded
that
the
examiner
had
been
an
error
with
respect
to
his
facts.
namely,
we
did
not
raise
prices
in
st.
louis
in
october
1953.
as
a
consequence,
the
commission
made
no
statement
regarding
this
all
important
punishment
issue
in
its
opinion.
and
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
it
was
vital
that
they
do
so
because
one
of
the
issues
before
the
commission
was
that
we
were
lowering
our
prices
in
good
faith
to
meet
competition.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
commission
wouldn't
agree
that
this
punishment
issue
is
important
with
regard
to
the
discrimination
issue
as
a
legal
matter.
but
they
could
not
fail
to
see
that
it
would
be
a
vital
importance
with
respect
to
the
meeting
competition
issue.
and
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
commission
opinion
relating
to
the
punishment
issue.
now,
i
submit,
your
honors,
under
these
circumstances
that
this
case
cannot
be
--
should
not
be
considered
by
you
on
the
basis
that
there
was
proof
and
found
here
a
punishment
purpose
in
lowering
the
prices.
mr.
edgar
barton
in
a
--
in
the
order
that
was
issued,
your
honor,
there
is
a
sentence,
the
standard
sentence.
the
--
i
believe
it
is
the
commission
adopts
--
let
me
get
the
exact
language,
your
honor,
because
it's
--
it's
on
page
48
of
the
record.
there's
a
sentence
in
the
final
order.
it
reads,
“it
is
further
ordered
that
the
findings,
conclusions,
and
order,
as
modified,
contained
the
initial
decision
be
and
they
hereby
are
adopted
those
of
the
commission.”
now,
your
honor,
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
argument
before
the
commission
that
the
examiner
was
in
error
on
this
vital
fact.
the
commission
--
one
of
the
commissioners
asked
the
question
on
the
oral
argument
of
commission
counsel,
“didn't
anheuser-busch
raise
its
prices
in
st.
louis
in
october
1953?”
and
the
counsel
quite
correctly
said
it
did
not.
now,
i
--
this
sentence
is
somewhat
grammatically
dubious
because
the
--
as
modified,
grammatically
refers
to
all
that
goes
before,
but
in
any
event
i
submit
that
in
the
absence
of
comment
on
this
important
issue
in
the
commission
opinion,
this
sentence
in
the
order
which
is
of
doubtful
grammar
should
not
be
taken
as
an
adoption
of
the
issue
by
the
commission.
mr.
edgar
barton
i
think
not,
your
honor.
in
the
--
mr.
edgar
barton
--
light
of
the
--
mr.
edgar
barton
what
--
mr.
edgar
barton
i
think
it
says
considering
all
the
factors,
your
honor,
they
have
in
the
prior
two
pages
of
the
opinion,
pages
--
starting
on
page
57
of
the
record
in
the
commission's
opinion.
they
are
detailing
the
reasons
that
they
will
not
accept
the
defense
of
meeting
competition
and
in
the
--
continue
on
page
57,
58
and
59,
then
we
reach
the
paragraph
from
which
your
honor
quoted,
“considering
all
the
factors.”
i
think
they
are
referring
to
the
factors
which
they've
outlined
prior
thereto.
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
this
record
that
the
commission
did
not
know,
did
not
adopt
this
punishment
finding
of
the
examiner.
it
is
clear
that
the
examiner
was
in
error
with
regard
to
his
facts
on
it.
there
is
no
support
in
the
record,
whatsoever,
for
the
contention
that
ab
lowered
its
prices
in
st.
louis
to
punish
the
competitors
for
not
raising
their
prices.
mr.
busch's
testimony,
to
be
sure,
pointed
out
that
if
there
had
been
a
readjustment
in
the
prices
after
anheuser-busch
raised
its
prices
outside
st.
louis,
there
wouldn't
have
been
this
loss
of
sales.
that's
true.
there
wasn't
--
mr.
edgar
barton
they
found
no
reason,
your
honor.
in
their
opinion,
they
did
not
treat
of
the
reason
for
the
reduction.
mr.
edgar
barton
yes,
your
honor.
they
specified
the
reasons
why
they
--
why
we
--
in
their
opinion
could
not
justly
claim
that
it
was
meeting
competition.
they
stated
that
we
couldn't
do
it
in
their
opinion
because
we
were
undercutting
when
we
met
because
of
our
alleged,
more
popular
acceptation.
and
secondly,
we
couldn't
do
it
because
we
weren't
losing
business
in
st.
louis,
but
we're
losing
it
elsewhere.
and
since
we
weren't
losing
business
in
st.
louis,
we
couldn't
lower
our
price
there
because
that
would
be
aggressive
rather
than
defensive.
mr.
edgar
barton
for
that
reason,
we
didn't
do
it
in
good
faith.
that's
right,
your
honor.
they
--
mr.
edgar
barton
your
honor,
i
--
i
would
--
in
that
connection
pointed
out
that
if
the
commission
had
found
that
we
had
lowered
our
price
for
a
punishment
purpose,
it
would
have
been
extremely
germane
to
have
mentioned
it
in
its
opinion.
it
would
have
been
the
fact
which
would
have
--
no
other
fact
would
have
needed
to
be
mentioned,
but
they
didn't
do
it
because
they
realized
that
there
was
no
basis
for
that
finding
in
the
record.
mr.
edgar
barton
they
did
not
say
so
in
their
opinion,
your
honor,
and
they
--
they
did
not
--
mr.
edgar
barton
they
did
in
their
--
in
the
order.
mr.
edgar
barton
i
--
i
don't
quite
know
how
one
reads
that
sentence,
if
it
is
read
grammatically,
it
--
they
did
not
approve
all
of
the
findings.
mr.
edgar
barton
no.
there
is
nothing
other
than
what
i've
mentioned,
your
honor,
in
the
opinion
or
in
the
order.
there
is
on
page
--
and
it's
on
page
1100
--
i
mean
14
--
1514
of
the
record,
a
colloquy
between
commissioner
seacrest
and
mr.
mayer
who
was
counsel
for
the
commission
at
which
time
the
fact
that
was
in
issue,
namely,
whether
ab
raised
its
price
in
st.
louis,
in
october
1953,
was
conceded
to
be
wrong
by
mr.
mayer.
in
other
words,
commissioner
seacrest
was
asking
that
question
in
the
light
of
my
argument
to
the
commission
that
the
examiner
had
aired
in
his
finding.
mr.
edgar
barton
the
argument
before
the
commission
is
not
part
of
the
record,
your
honor.
it
--
yes,
i'm
sorry.
it
is
part
of
the
record.
the
whole
record
is
before
the
court.
it's
not
part
of
the
printed
record,
but
the
whole
record
is
in
--
before
the
court
and
there
has
been
a
stipulation
entered
into
between
counsel
making
that
whole
record
part
of
the
proceedings
here.
now,
if
your
honor
pleases,
as
i
said,
all
the
retailer
purchasers
after
we
reduced
our
price
in
st.
louis
paid
exactly
the
same
price
for
budweiser
and
that
was
the
same
price
that
was
paid
by
them
for
all
other
brands.
mr.
edgar
barton
thank
you
your
honor.
during
the
course
of
the
price
reductions
that
ab
made
in
st.
louis,
it
overhauled
its
sales
methods
and
intensified
them.
the
amount
spent
for
advertising
both
in
st.
louis
and
outside
st.
louis
was
increased
to
the
level
of
its
competitors
in
st.
louis
and
increased
outside
and
all
these
things
were
done
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
more
business.
with
reference
to
the
question
your
honor
asked
as
to
why
budweiser
price
was
raised
in
march
of
1955.
the
reason
which
appears
in
the
record
is
that
in
that
--
at
that
time
anheuser-busch
put
out
a
new
product,
which
was
called
busch
lager
and
was
retailed
as
(inaudible)
of
the
regional
beers
in
st.
louis.
it
was
also
put
out
over
a
wider
area.
that
one
didn't
go
over
and
a
new
product
busch
(inaudible)
was
put
out
and
that's
was
presently
on
the
market,
but
in
connection
with
putting
out
the
new
product
it
was
inconsistent
to
have
budweiser
in
the
new
product
selling
at
the
same
price,
so
budweiser
was
raised,
the
amount
which
was
specified.
thereafter,
several
months
after
the
price
raise
in
march
of
1955
the
federal
trade
commission
charged
that
our
price
reduction
in
st
louis
violated
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
robinson-patman.
now,
in
essence
the
facts
found
by
the
commission
here,
and
i
think
the
facts
are
important
is
that
ab
is
not
a
--
one
of
the
delights
of
industry
such
as
might
be
true
in
the
standard
oil
case
back
in
the
days
when
before
this
clayton
was
passed.
anheuser-busch
has
70%
of
national
sales
of
beers.
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
of
the
competitors
in
st
louis
were
among
the
largest
35
brewers
in
united
states
and
falstaff
was
number
4
among
the
brewers
in
the
united
states.
now
its
true
budweiser
sold
at
many
markets
in
the
country
at
various
prices
depending
upon
that
differing
freight
rates
from
st
louis
to
those
markets,
depending
upon
the
different
tax
rate
that
exist.
there's
a
great
variety
of
taxes
for
beer
which
is
up
in
washington
dc
and
in
missouri.
missouri
has
the
lowest
tax
on
beer
than
any
state
in
the
union.
and
--
mr.
edgar
barton
we
have
two
other
breweries
your
honors.
there's
a
brewery
in
north
new
jersey
and
there's
a
brewer
--
brewery
in
los
angeles,
california.
falstaff
on
the
other
hand
have
seven
breweries
located
conveniently
around
the
1/3
of
the
country
in
which
they
do
business.
and
therefore
they
have
lower
freight
rates
from
their
breweries
to
markets
than
we
have
from
st
louis
to
those
markets.
now
the
commission
expressly
recognized
therefore,
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
market
reality
to
require
a
uniform
pricing
by
ab
or
by
any
other
brewery.
at
the
time
of
our
temporary
price
reductions
in
st
louis
our
competitors
there
accounted
for
83%
of
the
market.
we
had
12%
and
5%
was
represented
by
other
national
shipping
breweries
and
some
others.
all
the
competitors
in
st
louis
they
stated
were
substantial
companies
doing
business
as
counsel
said
over
a
wide
area
and
they
have
between
75%
and
90%
of
their
sales
outside
st
louis
where
there
was
no
price
reduction.
petitioner
concedes
that
there
was
no
proof
of
any
sales
below
cost
during
either
price
reductions
and
indeed
there
was
a
concession
of
the
trial
that
we
operated
profitably
in
st
louis
during
the
period.
the
only
claimed
result
of
the
price
reduction
was
that
ab,
the
last
place
seller
in
st
louis
temporarily
gained
some
sales
in
the
st
louis
market
while
its
competitors
accounted
for
somewhat
less
of
the
market
during
that
period
than
they
previously
had,
2/3
of
the
market
rather
than
4/5
of
the
market.
now
on
these
bare
facts,
the
commission
found
that
we
violated
the
robinson-patman
act
stating
that
we've
discriminated
in
price
because
we
reduced
the
prices
in
st
louis
and
didn't
reduce
them
elsewhere
and
that
we
injured
competition
because
the
difference
in
our
prices
in
st
louis
and
markets
elsewhere
caused
the
diversion
of
sale
to
us
from
our
competitors
in
st
louis.
that's
what
they
held
and
the
meeting
competition
event
was
inapplicable
they
said
for
two
reasons.
first,
they
said
its
--
they
claim
that
our
reduced
prices
which
at
their
lowest
exactly
equal
to
our
competitor's
prices
did
not
meet
an
equally
low
price
but
rather
under
kept
them
and
they
held
further
in
denying
the
meeting
competition
defense
that
since
we
were
not
losing
sales
in
st
louis
but
losing
them
elsewhere,
we
couldn't
reduce
our
prices
in
st
louis
in
order
to
recoup
some
of
those
loses,
even
though
the
competitors
inside
st
louis
and
outside
st
louis
to
whom
we
are
losing
the
business
were
by
and
large
the
same
and
it
was
feasible
for
us
to
reduce
the
prices
in
st
louis
to
recapture
part
of
that
business
and
it
wasn't
feasible
for
us
to
do
it
outside
st
louis.
the
way
they
expressed
however,
more
advantageous
it
was
for
us
to
do
it
in
st
louis.
the
commission
on
the
basis
of
these
findings
and
these
facts
which
they
found
issued
an
order
which
would
prohibit
ab
from
ever
making
any
reduction
in
price
any
place
that
it
had
a
competitor
which
is
every
place,
unless
it
proportionally
reduced
its
prices
everywhere
simultaneously.
mr.
edgar
barton
the
order
is
at
r
488
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
barton
now
it's
true
that
the
counsel
for
the
government
now
concedes
that
that
order
maybe
unduly
broad,
but
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
order
is
a
precise
--
precise
reflection
of
whole
commission
theory
in
this
case
and
that
the
concession
which
is
made
with
the
respect
breadth
of
the
order
is
really
a
concession
with
regards
to
the
theory
of
the
case.
now
i
might
say
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
we
made
four
contentions.
we
urge
that
there
was
no
discrimination
in
the
price
demonstrated.
this
issue
arose
not
on
the
petition
for
review
but
when
the
commission
filed
its
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
expressly
stated
that
it
was
not
concerned
with
differences
in
price
among
the
markets
but
solely
with
the
reduction
in
price
in
one
market
without
simultaneous
reductions
elsewhere.
second
we
argued
that
even
there
was
a
discrimination
in
price
there
was
no
injury
to
competition
shown
from
the
discrimination
as
required
by
the
statute.
third
that
in
any
event
ab
had
met
an
equally
low
price
of
competitor
in
good
faith.
and
fourth,
that
order
was
illegal
in
the
sense
that
its
effect
was
to
eliminate
and
deprive
ab
of
statutory
defenses
and
would
be
completely
anti-competitive.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
ab
did
not
discriminate
the
price
between
different
purchasers
as
required
by
the
statute.
it
refused
to
adopt
the
commission's
position
that
a
price
discrimination
as
demonstrated
here
by
a
mere
price
reduction
in
one
market
without
simultaneous
reductions
everywhere.
rather
it
held
that
whereas
here
different
prices
in
different
markets
were
characteristic
of
all
sellers
in
the
industry,
a
mere
price
reduction
in
one
market
did
not
mean
that
there
was
a
discrimination
in
price
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
(a)
of
the
act.
based
upon
the
legislative
history,
it
held
that
price
discrimination
means
more
than
mere
difference
in
price
and
notice
that
the
commission
did
not
complain
about
the
common
fact
this
is
having
different
prices
in
different
markets.
viewing
the
cases
it
did,
it
did
not
reach
the
commission's
contention
that
in
the
alleged
diversion,
temporary
diversion
of
sale
has
amounted
to
injury
within
2
(a).
and
although
it
didn't
reach
the
commission's
restrictive
interpretation
of
section
2
(b)
of
the
act,
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
stated
that
they
did
not
reach
these
questions.
having
stated
what
this
case
involves
perhaps
it
is
--
perhaps
it
is
well
also
to
state
what
it
does
not
involve.
first,
despite
the
argument
made
counsel
in
the
--
for
the
government
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
its
main
brief,
the
case
does
not
involve
the
proposition
that
a
price
discrimination
under
2
(a)
is
limited
to
sales
at
different
prices
to
competing
purchasers.
we
have
never
so
contended.
we
do
not
now
so
contend
and
the
court
below
did
not
so
hold.
the
commission's
argument
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
its
main
brief
was
directed
not
upon
what
the
court
held,
but
rather
upon
what
the
commission
called
the
thrust
of
the
opinion
and
upon
the
court's
emphasis
on
certain
facts.
in
our
brief,
filed
here,
we
demonstrated
the
court
of
appeals
obviously
recognized
that
2
(a)
covered
sales
at
different
prices
to
non-competing
customers
by
its
full
quotation
from
congress
and
had
it
back,
which
outlined
the
possibility
of
discrimination
in
price
between
non-competing
purchasers
under
certain
circumstances.
we
noted
that
when
the
commission's
brief
referred
to
the
legislative
history
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
it
omitted
that
portion
which
referred
to
sales
below
cost
which
could
be
referable
only
to
price
discrimination
among
non-competing
purchasers.
now
in
its
reply
brief
and
its
oral
argument,
i
do
not
believe
that
petitioner
repeats
the
precise
position
which
it
took
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
its
main
brief
but
appears
to
have
abandoned
it.
it
now
contends
that
the
court
below
construed
the
statute
so
as
to
make
it
applicable
to
different
prices
to
non
competing
purchasers
only
when
adverse
economic
effects
upon
purchasers
paying
higher
prices
are
shown.
however,
this
is
not
correct
either.
to
be
sure,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
relationship
between
non
competing
purchasers
is
required,
but
this
does
not
mean
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
or
even
infer
that
injury
to
purchasers
paying
the
higher
price
was
required.
rather,
the
legislative
history
shows
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
by
inference
if
not
expressly,
that
what
is
required
to
create
the
relationship
between
non
competing
purchasers
was
proof
of
sales
below
cost
or
necessary
profit
in
the
area
of
the
lower
prices
thereby
leaving
that
deficit
if
such
losses
has
occurred
to
be
made
up
by
higher
prices
to
other
purchasers
elsewhere.
however,
this
case
does
not
involve
sales
and
loss
in
one
market
until
the
competitors
were
forced
out
of
business
while
at
the
same
--
same
time
making
up
those
losses
in
other
markets.
they
expressly
conceded
during
the
proceeding
that
the
increased
sales
of
ab
and
st.
louis
allowed
it
to
operate
properly
within
that
area.
they
expressly
found
there
was
no
proof
of
--
that
we
used
income
or
profit
from
the
rest
of
our
businesses
to
stabilize
losses
in
saint
louis
or
indeed
that
were
any
losses
in
st.
louis
and
counsel
here
concedes
that
those
findings
were
made.
consequently
there
were
no
losses
to
be
passed
on
by
higher
prices
to
purchasers
in
other
areas,
moreover,
the
st.
louis
competitors
were
not
just
local
competitors,
but
they
were
substantial
company,
doing
business
through
out
a
wide
area
and
they
were
willing
to
transport
from
st.
louis
and
the
outside.
it
was
expressly
found
as
i
said
that
75%
to
90%
of
their
business
was
done
outside
of
st.
louis.
it
was
apparent
to
these
competitors.
they
couldn't
be
put
of
a
business
or
their
competition
impaired
by
ab's
price
reduction
in
st.
louis.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first
issue
here,
the
issue
of
whether
not
ab
discriminated
in
price
that
--
that
was
the
decisive
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
turn
first
to
the
words
of
the
statute.
mr.
edgar
barton
no
your
honor.
if
i'm
not
--
mr.
edgar
barton
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
i
think
that
if
your
honor
should
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
this
issue,
that
it's
within
your
power
to
examine
the
further
issues
in
the
case
under
a
long
line
of
cases
and
that
for
reasons
which
i
would
like
to
state
later,
it's
desirable
to
do
so.
mr.
edgar
barton
the
government
disagrees
that
this
case
is
ripe
for
such
decision.
i
don't
think
they
disagree
that
the
court
is
without
the
power
to
do
so.
mr.
edgar
barton
yes
your
honor
i
believe
so
for
reasons
which
i
would
like
to
state
when
i
take
those
up.
now
the
statute
itself,
section
2(a)
--
mr.
edgar
barton
the
record
is
three
volumes
and
in
it
appears
--
mr.
edgar
barton
no,
the
unprinted
record
--
that
which
is
not
printed
is
very
little.
we
printed
practically
everything.
mr.
edgar
barton
we
printed
everything
except
the
argument
before
the
commission
and
the
proposed
findings
before
the
examiner.
now
the
statute
itself,
2
(a),
provides
in
pertinent
parts
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
discriminate
in
price
between
different
purchasers
where
the
affect
of
such
discrimination
maybe
substantially
lessen
competition
or
great
monopoly
in
any
line
of
commerce.
thus,
there
are
at
least
three
separate
elements
which
must
be
proved
before
a
violation
of
the
statute
is
found.
first,
that
a
seller
discriminates
in
price
between
different
purchasers
second,
that
there
may
be
in
any
line
of
commerce,
the
injury
to
competition
required
by
the
statute
and
third,
that
that
injury
to
competition
was
caused
by
the
discrimination
in
prices.
the
commission
here
asked
the
court
of
appeals
to
hold
that
a
mere
reduction
of
prices
in
st.
louis
without
reducing
prices
in
other
marketing
areas
was
itself
to
discriminate
in
price.
the
court
of
appeals
held
as
i've
stated
that
ab
and
not
--
was
not
shown
to
have
discriminated
in
price
between
different
purchasers
as
required
by
the
act.
it
held
that
to
discriminate
in
price
between
different
purchasers
meant
more
than
to
merely
reduce
prices
in
one
area
or
to
charge
different
prices
in
different
areas.
if
i
understand
them
correctly
here,
the
commission
now
argues
to
this
court
that
ab
discriminated
in
price
because
it
contends
any
difference
in
price
between
markets
is
a
discrimination
in
price.
you'll
recall
when
counsel
read
the
statute,
he
substituted
the
word
“different”
for
“discrimination”
and
construed
discrimination
to
mean
difference.
now,
since
it's
customary
in
many
industries
for
companies
to
have
different
prices
in
different
markets,
the
ramifications
of
the
adoption
of
this
doctrine
are
extremely
pervasive
and
will
inevitably
deter
normal
pricing
activities
which
have
no
anti
trust
significance.
this
court
has
never
draft
--
directly
passed
upon
the
meaning
of
discriminate
in
price
in
a
territorial
price
case.
balian
against
arden
farms,
a
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit,
directly
involved
the
question
and
came
to
the
same
conclusion
as
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case,
namely,
that
a
mere
difference
in
price
didn't
constitute
a
discrimination.
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
balian.
now,
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
plain
dictionary
meaning
of
discriminate
that
is,
differentiating
unfairly
in
its
opinion.
the
commission's
main
brief
to
this
court
concedes
as
much
but
claims
that
another
dictionary
meaning
which
it
mis-cites
should
been
used.
but
all
the
legislative
history
is
in
accord
with
the
meaning
of
discriminate
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals.
that
legislative
history
demonstrates
that
the
term
discriminate
in
price
means
more
that
a
mere
difference
in
price.
congressman
utterback's
statement,
congressman
utterback
was
the
floor
manager
of
robins-patman,
he
has
been
much
with
his
statement
--
had
been
much
relied
upon
by
this
court,
in
other
cases,
congressman
utterback
stated
quite
plainly
and
i
quote
“it
has
meaning
as
simple
english
a
discrimination
is
more
than
a
mere
difference.”
we
have
found
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
contrary
and
nothing
contrary
is
cited
in
either
the
commission's
briefs.
in
fact,
petitioner
now
appears
to
agree
that
a
discrimination
is
more
than
a
mere
difference
when
it
states
in
its
reply
brief
at
page
7
that
discrimination
in
legal
usage
means
more
than
a
differentiation
in
treatment
which
judged
by
controlling
legal
standard
is
invidious.
now
if
the
differentiation
must
be
invidious
then
i
submit
that
discrimination
must
be
more
than
a
mere
difference.
mr.
edgar
barton
your
honor,
i'm
not
entirely
clear
what
he
was
arguing
on
that
point.
i
take
it
that
his
argument
was
that
discrimination
should
be
interpreted
as
difference.
mr.
edgar
barton
well
the
standard
is
what
he
said
was
set
out
to
determine
if
that
were
the
effective
clause
your
honor.
now
i
submit
that
you
cannot
read
the
word
--
mr.
edgar
barton
that
is
a
defense
your
honor
to
the
statute,
but
that
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
discrimination.
mr.
edgar
barton
well
your
honor
i
take
it
that
there
would
be
--
it
would
be
a
misreading
of
the
statute
however
to
say
that
the
word
did
--
that
would
be
construing
the
whole
statute
to
be
discrimination,
and
then
you
would
determine
whether
it
would
have
the
necessary
--
or
for
the
difference
you
have
the
necessary
effect
and
whether
it
was
not
otherwise
exculpated
by
one
of
the
sections
proviso
of
the
statute
and
then
you
would
say
that
it
is
--
if
it
falls
in
that
category
it
is
a
--
not
a
discrimination
if
it
were
exculpated
or
a
discrimination
otherwise
but
our
contention
is
that
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word
discrimination
and
by
the
legislative
history
the
word
discriminate
has
a
meaning
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
section
of
the
statute.
mr.
edgar
barton
i
would
say--i
would
say
your
honor
that
it
has
to
be
proved
in
a
territorial
price
case,
what
has
been
proved
in
the
prior
cases
pertaining
to
this
matter,
namely,
in
moore
against
mead,
in
puerto
rico,
in
the
maryland
baking
case,
and
in
e.
b.
muller
that
there
was
on
the
part
of
the
seller
who
sold
at
a
lower
price
in
an
area,
sales
below
cost
or
--
mr.
edgar
barton
because
that
your
honor
is
indicia
invidiousness.
it's
an
indicia
of
showing
that
there's
been
an
unfair
lowering
of
the
price
in
that
area.
mr.
edgar
barton
the
object
was
two-fold
your
honor
in
your
passage
of
clayton
and
robinson-patman.
the
object
was
one,
to
protect
competing
purchasers
against
having
different
prices
charged
as
between
them
where
there
was
injury
to
competition
and
where
there
was
no
defense.
in
connection
with
territorial
price
cases
the
intention
as
clearly
disclosed
by
the
section
2
of
the
original
clayton
act
and
as
disclosed
by
congressman
utterback's
statement
was
that
there
should
be
some
relationship
between
the
purchasers
receiving
a
different
prices
and
in
a
territorial
line
case
that
was
to
be
established
by
the
showing
of
sales
below
cost
or
necessary
profits
in
the
area
of
the
lower
price
or
alternatively
in
accordance
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
there
was
clear
intent
on
the
part
of
the
discriminator
to
eliminate
competition
in
area
of
the
price
reduction.
mr.
edgar
barton
yes
your
honor,
i
appreciate
your
question.
mr.
edgar
barton
yes
your
honor
that's
my
contention.
mr.
edgar
barton
and
now
--
and
i
want
to
point
why
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
edgar
barton
no
your
honor.
i
don't
think
they
do.
i
think
the
commission's
position
here
looked
at
logically
on
the
basis
of
what
counsel
has
said
is
that
any
difference
in
price
between
markets
is
a
discrimination.
now
he
says
that
that's
not
illegal
unless
it
has
the
required
effect
and
it
wouldn't
be
illegal
if
the
affirmative
defenses
were
approved.
mr.
edgar
barton
if
they
--
if
they
made
such
a
finding
i
believe
your
honor
there
would
a
discrimination
in
here.
mr.
edgar
barton
no
your
honors
it
isn't.
if
your
honor
was
to
bear
with
me
on
that
i
--
before
the
luncheon
i
tried
i
tried
--
i
wanted
to
try
to
make
my
position
clear
that
there
was
no
finding
here
of
--
in
purpose
to
eliminate
the
competitors.
mr.
edgar
barton
yes.
mr.
edgar
barton
i
would
agree
to
that
your
honors.
i
say
that
--
mr.
edgar
barton
that's
right
it
rests
on
facts
your
honor,
but
the
commission's
position
here
is
not
based
on
that.
the
commission's
position
here
on
this
discrimination
point
is
based
on
the
theory
that
any
difference
in
price
is
a
discrimination
without
more.
now
why
shouldn't
it
be
the
law
that
any
difference
is
a
discrimination
or
reductions
in
price
and
differences
in
price
in
various
markets
in
every
areas
are
evidence
of
normal
competitive
activities
in
most
industries.
they
reflect
not
only
different
costs
and
market
conditions
but
also
active
competition
for
business.
in
fact
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
page
8,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
it
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
the
bottom
of
the
page
says,
“there's
a
significant
difference
legally
as
well
as
factually
between
normal
and
legitimate
pricing
activities
designed
to
obtain
a
larger
share
of
business
in
a
marketing
area
and
those
which
represent
a
punitive
or
destructive
attack
on
local
competitors
and
impair
the
health
and
--
the
vitality
and
health
are
the
processes
of
the
competition.
now
i
submit
your
honor
that
that
is
precisely
my
point
that
this
is
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
purpose
or
whether
the
price
discrimination
is
of
the
type
that
will
sap
the
vitality
of
competition
that
determines
whether
it
is
a
discrimination
in
price.
mr.
edgar
barton
that
is
certainly
true
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
barton
no,
i
don't
quite
think
so
your
honor
because
i
think
it
is
clear
that
--
mr.
edgar
barton
that's
also
some
type.
mr.
edgar
barton
your
honor
--
mr.
edgar
barton
no
it
really
isn't
your
honor.
they
--
they
--
commission's
interpretation
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
you've
--
the
brief
is
up
before
this
court.
we
have
had
the
seventh
circuit
brief
right
here.
their
contention
in
the
seventh
circuit
was
that
any
lowering
of
price
without
simultaneous
lowering
elsewhere
is
a
discrimination
in
price.
then
they
said
that
the
discrimination
here
had
the
adverse
effect
because
ab
gained
business
and
some
other
competitors
lost
business
during
the
period
of
price
reduction.
and
then
they
said
that
there
wasn't
and
the
meeting
competition
defense
was
not
established
because
of
the
reasons
that
they've
outlined
--
that
i've
outlined.
they
did
throw
into
their
brief
before
the
seventh
circuit
this
contention
that
we
had
done
for
the
purpose
of
punishing.
curiously
enough,
when
they
argued
this
point
before
the
court
of
appeals
they
can
didn't
claim
your
honor
that
the
finding
of
the
examiner
on
this
point
had
been
adopted
in
the
order.
rather
they
state
it
in
the
brief
which
is
before
your
honor
in
the
seventh
circuit
that
there
was
specific
language
in
the
opinion
which
adopted
it.
well
that
was
obviously
wrong
and
we
pointed
that
out
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
suppose
for
example
that
a
manufacturer
is
losing
sales
in
general.
mr.
edgar
barton
yes.
mr.
edgar
barton
alright.
mr.
edgar
barton
your
honor
i
think
that
would
be
a
closer
case
than
this
one.
i'm
not
entirely
sure
that
2
(a)
should
be
so
construed
to
say
that
action
if
taken
would
per
se
be
a
discrimination,
but
i
think
it'd
be
a
closer
case,
but
i
would
point
out
further
--
mr.
edgar
barton
pardon?
mr.
edgar
barton
well
i
think
--
mr.
edgar
barton
well
your
honor
maybe
it
would
be.
i'm
not
going
to
take
a
firm
decision
that
it
is
not.
mr.
edgar
barton
i'm
not
going
to
take
a
firm
decision
it's
not.
mr.
edgar
barton
it's
says
it's
arguable.
mr.
edgar
barton
that's
right.
that's
our
contention
your
honor.
now
why
should
it
--
just
take
a
couple
of
examples
that
deter
--
that
outline
and
elucidate
why
a
difference
is
not
a
discrimination?
suppose
a
manufacturer
is
loosing
sales
generally
throughout
the
country,
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
he
can
try
to
do.
he
can
try
to
increase
his
advertising.
he
can
try
change
his
package
or
his
product,
but
if
it
is
a
product
on
the
classical
theory
he'll
decide,
well
let's
try
lowering
prices.
lower
prices
means
more
sale,
but
there
is
such
a
thing
inelastic
demand
and
he
may
wish
to
try
out
that
lowering
of
prices
to
try
it
in
one
or
two
markets
to
see
how
it
goes
and
then
if
it
works
there,
lower
generally.
now
there
a
lowering
of
prices
in
one
market
and
not
others,
sales
may
increase.
but
if
you
try
--
tried
it
and
be
successful
under
the
commission's
theory
it'd
be
violating
the
robinson-patman
act.
or
suppose
in
a
very
competitive
market
where
there
are
number
of
strong
competitors
one
competitor
changes
its
price.
product
is
binding
a
small
patented
gadget
or
he
gets
an
advertising
campaign
that
catches
on
and
that
competitor
begins
to
take
over
increase
in
share
of
the
businesses.
our
manufacturer
can't
make
the
thing,
product's
change.
his
advertising
agency
can't
produce
the
same
catchy
slogan.
so
you
have
to
reduce
prices
slightly
in
order
to
try
to
make
up
for
that
advantage.
or
suppose
that
the
manufacturer
is
not
selling
it
all
on
a
particular
market
and
he
wants
to
enter
the
market
in
order
to
get
a
toe
hold
as
hamms
beer
is
trying
to
do
in
this
market
as
you
may
have
noticed
in
the
washington
post
advertisement
yesterday,
coming
into
the
market
at
local
beer
prices
even
though
they
sell
them
in
chicago
and
all
the
rest
of
the
country,
this
part
of
the
country
at
so-called
premium
prices.
now,
there
are
many
other
examples.
it's
perfectly
true
that
none
of
those
situations
are
precisely
the
case
we
have
here.
but
the
point
is,
that
localized
price
reductions
or
difference
in
price
between
different
markets
serve
a
perfectly
legitimate
purpose
and
it
is
with
the
view
towards
permitting
the
continuation
of
these
and
other
legitimate
purposes
that
the
statute
should
be
construed.
and
i
might
point
out
that
none
of
these
illustrations
come
within
the
statutory
defenses.
if
they
are
to
be
preserved,
therefore
it
must
be
by
construction
of
some
other
term
in
the
statute.
thus
congress
and
utterback
have
told
it
and
these
illustrations
have
shown
that
a
discrimination
in
price
is
more
than
a
mere
difference
in
price.
but
what
in
addition
is
required?
well,
i
pointed
out
in
answer
justice
black's
question
at
least
that
the
congressman
utterback's
statement
shows
clearly
that
the
other
circumstance
which
is
required
is
proof
that
the
seller
who
had
the
different
prices
is
selling
below
cost
and
necessary
profits.
and
i
don't
understand
in
the
light
of
the
terms
of
that
statement
how
the
commission
can
claim,
as
it
does
in
its
reply
in
its
brief,
reply
(b)
that
the
decision
below
would
leave
business
organizations
free
to
cause
to
conduct
territorial
price
foray
so
long
as
they
were
willing
to
absorb
loses.
if
they
had
loses,
there
would
be
discrimination
in
price
under
the
statute.
now,
this
analysis
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
as
contained
in
the
house
committee
report
of
the
original
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
which
is
relied
upon
by
petitioner
in
its
brief
in
part
as
the
report
on
the
bill
which
became
the
clayton
act.
this
committee
report
demonstrates
that
the
evil
at
which
section
2
was
directed
in
connection
with
territorial
price
differences
was
lower
prices
involving
sales
of
a
commodity
at
below
the
cost
of
production
with
the
intent
of
destroying
the
business
of
competitors
of
the
seller
and
obtain
a
monopoly.
now,
it's
not
a
sufficient
answer
to
claim
that
this
legislative
history
is
wholly
inapplicable
because
the
bill
was
changed
in
conference
before
enactment.
the
evil
remains
the
same.
it
is
true
that
the
language
of
the
bill
was
changed
and
that
the
language
requiring
proof
of
purpose
was
eliminated
when
the
bill
was
rewritten
by
the
conference
committee
as
is
claimed
by
counsel.
however,
it
is
clear
that
the
house
report
described
the
evil
at
which
the
territorial
price
aspects
to
the
bill
were
drafted
and
that
is
still
the
evil,
i
submit.
moreover,
the
prior
adjudicated
price
cases
in
which
the
violation
has
been
found,
uniformly
involve
situations
of
this
nature,
sales
below
cost
to
drive
out
the
sole
competitor
and
obtain
a
monopoly.
as
counsel
said
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question
this
morning,
he
is
not
talking
about
in
this
case,
a
case
like
the
standard
oil
case.
he's
talking
about
the
case
that
the
commission
made
in
--
in
this
situation
and
it's
a
case
that's
far
different
from
those
cases
that
have
been
brought
under
this
act.
it
was
true
in
the
only
territorial
price
case
has
been
before
the
district
court,
moore
against
mead
there,
there
was
terribly
low
cost
as
disclosed
in
the
record
and
the
clear
purpose
was
as
found
in
the
--
as
stated
in
the
opinion
to
drive
a
competitor
out
of
business.
it
was
true
in
porto
rican
and
it
was
true
in
muller.
in
maryland
baking,
there
was
a
clear
purpose
to
punish
a
competitor
for
who
went
into
a
business
that
the
discriminator
didn't
want
him
to
go
into.
there
wasn't
clear
proof
of
sales
below
cost
but
the
issue
was
not
made.
in
none
of
these
cases
was
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
term
“discriminated
in
price”
at
issue.
however
they
are
--
each
one
of
them
consistent
with
our
position.
in
the
one
case
that
we
found
in
which
this
was
an
issue,
balian,
the
absence
of
such
facts
led
the
ninth
circuit
to
hold
that
the
price
reduction
made
(inaudible)
in
los
angeles
but
not
elsewhere
was
not
in
price
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
mr.
edgar
barton
i
don't
that
--
mr.
edgar
barton
yes,
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
below
cost,
your
honor.
i
think
it
clearly
does
not
have
to
be
below
cost.
in
these
cases
here
to
which
i
made
reference,
the
proof
was
that
it
was
actually
below
cost.
mr.
edgar
barton
i
do
not
contend
that
here.
mr.
edgar
barton
your
honor,
they
--
they
all
(inaudible).
the
sales
went
up
as
counsel
pointed
out
and
they
had
the
record
doesn't
disclose
what
the
profit
picture
was
in
saint
louis.
counsel
made,
conceded
that
it
was
profitable,
but
there
was
no
reference
in
the
record
to
that
fact.
now,
the
doctrine
of
these
cases
demonstrate
as
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
ab
did
not
discriminate
in
price
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
commission
opinion
is
barren
of
any
reference
to
sales
below
cost
or
at
reduced
profits
or
any
purpose
or
design
of
eliminating
its
competitor
or
punishing
a
competitor,
not
a
word
in
the
commission
opinion
about
that.
and
under
these
circumstances
it's
apparent
that
the
commission
has
not
brought
this
case
within
the
definition
of
discrimination
in
price
as
established
by
the
legislative
history
and
by
the
adjudicated
cases.
there's
no
warrant
whatsoever
for
the
commission's
contention
that
the
holding
of
the
court
below
would
permit
severe
price
reductions
for
the
purpose
of
driving
competitors
out
of
business.
mr.
edgar
barton
no,
your
honor.
i
am
arguing
that
the
commission
--
mr.
edgar
barton
well
--
well
i
think
--
mr.
edgar
barton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
barton
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
a
finding
of
that
nature,
but
i'm
arguing
primarily
that
the
commission
did
not
make
that
finding.
mr.
edgar
barton
now,
and
that
i
might
point
out
that
this
pattern
of
the
prior
cases
had
a
reduction
for
the
purpose
of
driving
competitor
out
of
business
is
not
even
remotely
the
factual
allegations
or
proof
in
this
case
and
the
court
below
was
dealing
with
this
case
and
not
with
the
hypothetical
case.
mr.
edgar
barton
your
honor
--
your
honor,
i
would
ask
that
it
--
it
does.
i
take
--
i
think
reflect
the
actual
fact
of
what
the
purpose
was.
and
i
would
--
the
testimony
is
about
eight
or
ten
pages
in
length.
and
i
would
like,
if
possible
that
the
court
read
that
testimony
because
it
discloses
on
its
face
quite
candidly
that
the
only
purpose,
if
we're
reducing
prices
here,
was
to
get
more
business
and
to
try
to
find
some
answer
to
the
problem
that
they
had.
it
was
no
purpose
whatsoever
to
punish
competitors
for
not
having
raised
prices.
he
stated
quite
candidly
that
if
they
hadn't
lost
business,
there
probably
have
been
no
reason
to
reduce
prices
and
that's
quite
true.
mr.
edgar
barton
well
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
mr.
edgar
barton
no,
he
said
--
you
did
not
--
he
said
competitive-wise
certainly
that
their
failure
to
raise
prices
was
competitive-wise
a
reason
for
his
reduction.
mr.
edgar
barton
he
did
say
that
but
he
said
it
in
a
context,
your
honor,
of
explaining
that
if
there
had
been
no
loss
of
sale,
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
to
lower
prices
in
st.
louis
to
get
more
sales.
now
--
mr.
edgar
barton
that's
right,
your
honor.
that
is
what
his
testimony
was.
what
everything
he
said
was
consistent
with
the
record
and
that
was
the
fact.
now,
this
analysis
i
submit
indicates
that
the
words
“discriminating
in
price”
are
not
to
be
construed
out
of
context.
petitioner's
position
is
that
any
difference
in
prices
of
discrimination
but
is
not
actionable
under
2
(a)
unless
it
causes
injury
to
competition.
but
if
the
rule
were
that
a
mere
difference
in
price
constitutes
a
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
then
any
manufacturer
selling
at
different
prices
in
more
than
one
marketing
area
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
consumer
reaction
as
to
--
as
to
whether
he'd
be
--
be
found
in
violation.
if
consumers
decided
to
buy
more
of
his
products
in
the
areas
where
he
had
a
lower
price
for
any
number
of
legitimate
reasons
then
he's
violating
2
(a)
under
the
commission's
decision
here.
the
inevitable
tendency
of
the
adoption
of
such
rule
would
for
all
sellers
to
have
uniformly
high
prices
throughout
the
united
states.
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
envisage
the
public
interest.
how
the
public
interest
would
be
served
by
such
a
construction
of
the
statute.
for
under
these
circumstances
2
(a)
would
become
a
price
fixing
law
inconsistent
with
the
overall
congressional
policy
of
protecting
free
competition.
every
reduction
in
price
in
a
particular
market
and
every
difference
in
price
would
become
vulnerable.
no
seller
could
risk
reducing
his
price
in
any
market
without
reducing
--
even
though
to
gain
business
he
lost
elsewhere
because
if
you
obtain
more
business
in
the
area
of
the
price
reduction,
you
can
never
be
sure
that
the
commission
or
some
treble
damage
plaintiff
would
sue
in
a
court
and
claim
he
has
violated
the
law.
since
the
seller
could
never
know
in
advance
whether
his
price,
sales
had
increased
as
a
result
of
the
price
reduction,
who
would
never
reduce
prices
unless
he
thought
so.
in
any
realistic
view
of
the
commission's
proposition,
2
(a)
becomes
a
compelling
deterrent
to
active
price
competition
and
price
competition
is
the
very
essence
of
competition
itself.
petitioner's
position
would
create
the
incongruous
result
that
price
competition
would
be
more
restricted
than
none-price
forms
of
competition
such
as
advertising,
sales
promotion,
and
other
forms
of
sales
activity
which
do
not
benefit
the
public
would
recommend.
if
sales
gained
were
due
to
price
competition,
lowering
prices
in
one
area
but
not
lowering
them
elsewhere,
they'd
been
forbidden.
if
due
to
a
better
finance
advertising
program
by
a
seller
in
that
area,
they
would
enjoy
a
preferred
legal
position.
i
submit
the
statute
should
not
be
construed
to
create
this
situation.
after
all,
prices
are,
as
this
court
stated
in
socony
vacuum
like
this,
the
central
nervous
system
of
the
economy
and
any
restrictions
which
would
interfere
with
the
free
movement
of
price
is
to
be
avoided
unless
absolutely
required
by
congress.
mr.
edgar
barton
you
mean
--
mr.
edgar
barton
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
and
the
question
before
this
court
is
how
much
2
(a)
is
to
be
construed
to
restrict
competition.
there
is
as
i'm
sure
your
honor,
realizes
by
the
question,
a
–
somewhat
of
an
inconsistency
between
2(a)
in
the
sherman
act.
it's
been
stated
by
the
court
many
times.
and
the
question
here
is,
“is
2
(a)
to
be
construed
to
--
in
a
practical
effect
become
a
price-fixing
law
for
any
manufacturer
who
does
business
on
a
national
basis?”
is
he
going
to
have
to
charge
the
same
price
in
every
area
or
be
--
run
the
risk
of
violating
2
(a),
so
that
–
that's
the
construction
problem
is
before
the
court.
to
be
sure,
2
(a)
does
limit
competition
in
some
respect,
the
question
is
how
much
should
it
limit
competition?
mr.
edgar
barton
there
would
be
no
question
there'd
be
a
discrimination
in
price.
mr.
edgar
barton
there's
a
question
of
how
far
it
reaches
in
a
territorial
price
case,
your
honor.
now,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
in
an
answer
to
your
question,
we
don't
--
we
can
think
that
the
case
can
be
decided
on
the
ground
that
it
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
that
doesn't
mean
this
court
has
to
take
all
the
languages
the
court
of
appeals
used.
mr.
edgar
barton
yes.
mr.
edgar
barton
your
honor,
we
answered
that
question.
mr.
edgar
barton
the
answer
to
that
question
was
that
saint
louis
with
the
home
market
of
anheuser-busch.
it's
where
brewery
was
located.
there's
no
point
from
st.
louis
to
other
area.
therefore,
st.
louis
was
the
place
where
there'd
be
no
extra
cost
in
doing
it.
secondly,
we
had
well
presented
the
st.
louis
area.
that
was
our
home
market.
our
competitors
had
30%,
(inaudible)
had
something
like
25%
and
one
or
the
others
had
35%.
we
had
a
potential
for
growth
in
st.
louis
for
increased
sales
by
decreasing
prices
there.
in
st.
louis,
we
distributed
directly
to
retailers.
we
didn't
have
to
depend
on
chain
that
the
price
reduction
would
be
passed
on
to
retailers
by
the
wholesalers
where
we
distribute
in
most
other
areas.
those
are
the
reasons
that
we
reduced
prices
in
st.
louis
and
we
told
them,
time
and
time
again
in
the
record.
now,
we
contend,
your
honor
here
that
even
if
this
court
should
not
adopt
the
reasoning
adopted
below.
the
court
could
and
should
examine
the
other
two
contentions
and
rule
on
them
here.
now,
it's
clear
that
the
court
has
the
power
to
do
so.
it's
clear
also,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
court
should
do
so
here
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
this
case
in
its
various
facets
has
attracted
wide
attention
in
the
commercial
world.
and
until
this
issue
of
whether
difference
in
prices
is
discrimination
and
whether
therefore
manufacturers
can
be
sued
for
having
different
prices,
it's
a
clog
on
commercial
competition.
and
it
should
be
decided
and
decided
here
now.
secondly,
the
commission
is
carrying
--
has
instituted
a
number
of
cases
in
industries
diverse
as
oil
and
milk
based
the
same
theory.
if
the
theory
is
wrong,
they
should
be
told
so
to
save
time
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
the
other
two
issues
should
be
examined.
now,
in
connection
with
the
issue
of
injury
to
competition,
the
commission's
sole
basis
for
claimed
injury
here
is
that
some
of
these
competitors
temporarily
lost
business
in
st.
louis
and
we
temporarily
gained
something.
now,
that
has
never
been
considered
by
any
court
to
be
a
sufficient
basis
to
find
injury
to
competition.
in
all
of
the
other
cases
where
there
has
been
a
finding
of
injury
to
competition
based
on
a
territorial
price
case,
there
has
been
one
competitor
in
an
area.
the
sales
have
been
below
that
competitor's
price
or
below
cost.
the
period
of
the
price
reduction
has
been
an
extended
one
so
that
the
competitor
was
driven
out
of
business
and
also,
there's
been
a
destruction
of
a
channel
of
distribution
of
the
competing
seller
as
in
maryland
baking.
now,
here
we
have
no
one
of
these
things,
or
anything
that's
comparable
to
it.
the
fact
here
is
that
there
are
multiple
substantial
competitors
in
the
area
of
the
price
reduction.
the
price
reductions
were
made
only
in
the
one
city,
in
the
county
of
st.
louis
and
the
competitors
were
firmly
entrenched
elsewhere.
reductions
were
completely
temporary
in
nature.
competitors
listed
the
effects
of
those
reductions.
the
reductions
were
at
no
time
below
their
price
of
the
competitors.
all
the
competitors
continued
to
sell
to
the
same
retailers
to
whom
they'd
sold
previously.
all
the
competitors
pursued
normal
competitive
activities
putting
out
new
brands,
advertising
programs
and
last
but
not
least,
the
competitors
continued
to
make
substantial
profit.
on
that
basis,
your
honor,
we
contend
that
there
was
no
injury
to
competition.
it's
a
legal
question
really
in
this
case
whether
there
was
injury
to
competition
because
the
facts
they're
not
really
disputed,
the
only
question
is
whether
temporary
diversion
of
sales
from
substantial
companies
amounts
to
injury
to
competition
within
the
meaning
of
robinson-patman
and
i
submit
that
it
does
not.
mr.
edgar
barton
we
do
argue
that
in
our
brief,
your
honor
but
we
don't
concede
and
don't
think
there's
injury
to
competitors
here
either.
mr.
edgar
barton
your
honor,
we
take
issue
that
that
is
legal
injury
under
section
2
(a).
mr.
edgar
barton
that's
right,
your
honor.
that
it's
not.
mr.
edgar
barton
that
is
their
position,
your
honor
and
we
think
it's
wrong.
thank
you.
