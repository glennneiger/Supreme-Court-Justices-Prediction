mr.

in
the
--
in
the
different
regions
mr.
elman,
are
the
prices
of
the
premium

usually
the
same?
chief

chief

but
this
have
been
strongly
relied
on
it
through
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
commissioner
on
page
--
on
the
commission
on
page
59
where
it
says,
“considering
all
the
factors,
we
conclude
that
the
hearing
examiner
was
warranted
in
finding
that
respondent's
1954
price
reductions
in
the
saint
louis
market
were
not
made
in
good
faith
to
meet
the
equally
low
prices
of
competitors.”

but
what
--
chief

--
but
what
does
that
--
what
does
that
refer
to
--
chief

--
in
--
in
the
examiner's
findings?
it
must
refer
to
something.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
in
the
commission
find
was
the
reason
for
the
--
the
reduction
in
price?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
didn't
they
say
just
before
that
sentence
i
read
to
you
under
the
circumstances,
“respondent
cannot
justly
claim
that
it
was
meeting
competition.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
--
and
that
you
didn't
do
it
in
good
faith.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
but
does
--
i
just
wondered.
it
says
that
--
says
considering
all
the
factors.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
say
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
contrary
they
said
--
on
the
contrary,
they
approved
the
findings,
did
they
not
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
approved
the
findings
by
a
sentence
which
can
be
construed
to
mean
as
modified.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
barton.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
large
is
directed
in
this
case,
is
it
a
very
voluminous
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
no
i
mean
the
unprinted
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
testimony
mr.
busch
that
--
that
mr.
--
having
read
the
--
reflect
anything
on
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
think
that
was
the
statement
he
read.
i
thought
the
statement
he
read
was
to
the
effect
that
that
if
they
had
--
if
they
had
raised
their
prices
too,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
reduction
on
the
part
of
--
of
ab.
chief
justice
earl
warren
am
i
wrong
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
thought
he
said
also
that
if
that
hadn't
been
--
hadn't
been
for
the
fact
that
they
didn't
raise
their
prices,
then
it
wouldn't
have
been
done.
chief
justice

mr.
elman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead
and
finish

afternoon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
elman
before
you
sit
down
would
you
--
would
you
state
the
government's
position
on
whether
this
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
should
review
this
record
to
--
to
determine
the
other
issues
that
are
involved?
