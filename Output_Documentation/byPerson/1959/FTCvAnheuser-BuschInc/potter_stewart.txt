on
national
brands
are
not
--
that’s
not
synonymous
with
premium
brands.
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
fact
that
national
brands
are
higher
priced,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
--
but
it’s
also
true
or
am
i
wrong
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
some
local
and
regional
beers
are
premium
beers,
is
that
correct
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
as
among
those
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
--
before
you
proceed,
mr.
elman,
excuse
me,
as
among
the
five
national
brands,
as
among
the
five
national
beers
in
any
given
locality,
has
it
been
the
tradition
that
the
--
their
prices
are
the
same?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
it's
the
record
too?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
budweiser
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
now,
we're
in
st.
louis?
justice
potter
stewart
only
in
st.
louis.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
in
addition
to
these
three
regional
competitors,
falstaff,
gb
and
gw,
did
they
have
any
competition
from
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
four
nationals?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
indication
as
to
why
budweiser
raised
their
price
if
--
if
their
sales
have
been
booming
so
much?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
true
that
the
commission
adopted
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
examiner?
justice
potter
stewart
is
all
the
beer
actually
brewed
in
st
louis,
or
do
you
have
breweries
around
country?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
only
issue
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
but
on
that
the
government
disagrees
with
you
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
the
--
doesn't
the
commission
concede
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
at
least
arguable.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
the
matter
of
statutory
construction
if
there
has
to
be
competition,
there
has
to
be
differential
--
differentiations
made
in
price
among
competing
purchasers
or
purchasers
within
a
relationship
to
each
other
for
this
statute
2
(a)
to
be
applicable.
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
it
at
the
fact
here
that
their
--
their
actual
profits
were
not
from
--
in
st.
louis
from
the
st.
louis
business?
