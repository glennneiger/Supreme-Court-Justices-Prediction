justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
anything
in
there
anywhere
that
--
which
you
could
point
that
would
show
us
that
they
modified
it
with
reference
to
your
--
this
particular
finding
that
you
are
discussing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
argument?
is
it
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
we
should
decide
all
of
those
questions
that
were
left
undecided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
misunderstand
the
argument,
i'm
wondering,
i
--
i
understood
the
argument
to
be
that
the
statute
defined
its
own
invidiousness,
that's
what
i
thought
he
was
arguing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
difference
but
there
--
there's
some
standard
set
out
in
there
as
i
understood
him
to
argue
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
justified
by
difference
in
cause,
what
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
it's
a
defense
it
would
mean
but
--
whatever
--
whatever
attitude
(inaudible)
the
parties
have
to
present
it.
it
would
show
that
all
differences
are
not
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
--
what
would
you
say
would
have
to
be
proven
with
invidiousness
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
they
have
to
be
below
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
was
to
protect
the
purchaser
from
different
prices,
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
if
i
understand
your
argument
on
the
territories,
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
part
of
that
yesterday.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
say
what
part
it
is.
as
i
understand
it
if
you
say
that
this
company
or
any
other
that
does
a
national
business
is
free
under
this
act,
may
be
he
is,
fixed
prices
differently
in
each
city
in
the
country
if
he
wants
to
do
so
without
violating
the
act
so
long
as
it's
not
something
invidious
or
some
evil
purpose
connected
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
rather
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
what
the
2(a)
does,
isn't
it?
that
it
does
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
does
restrict
competition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
difference
in
price
that
they
made
among
testimony
of
saint
louis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
really
it's
a
question
of
how
far
it
reaches.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
that
you
--
you're
arguing
i
suppose
that
the
injury
to
competitors
by
the
verdict
is
their
business,
this
is
not
an
injury
to
competition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
it
takes
their
business
--
if
i
read
now
the
current
posture
that
is
i
understand
is
that
the
basic
charge
the
commission
made
according
to
it's
charge,
and
i
think
you've
made
the
adjoining
issue
on
it
right
there
where
they
said
it
is
charged,
they
said
your
step
was
so
good
and
respondent
discriminated
in
price
between
different
purchasers
(inaudible)
rate
and
quality
with
the
effect
among
other
things
that
the
verdict
substantial
business
from
respondent
to
competitor
to
the
respondent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
sure
that's
not
enough
injury
to
competition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
are
taking
the
position
as
i
understand
it
that
the
change
in
or
difference
in
price
in
anyone
place
it
that
it
affects
diversion
of
business
from
competitors
of
that
place
for
national
policy
is
a
violation
of
2
(a).
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
like
to
ask
you
one
question
just
to
clearing
my
mind
(inaudible).
suppose
in
california,
mississippi,
and
north
carolina,
they
were
selling
this
beer
at
a
low
cost
or
at
high
prices
as
they
were
in
st.
louis,
your
injury
shown
was
nothing
more
as
far
as
st.
louis
is
concerned
than
the
diversion
of
business
from
anheuser-busch's
competitors
in
st.
louis,
is
that
the
government
position
that
territorially
speaking
they
have
--
the
price
has
to
be
the
same
in
all
those
places?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
standard
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
st.
louis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
those
were
--
there
were
--
what
i
want
to
get
at
is
that
so
far
as
here
when
i
read
the
--
in
commission's
opinion
at
the
beginning
they
--
what
it
is
they
charged,
they
indicate
that
diversion
of
business
of
anheuser-busch's
competitors
in
st.
louis
by
reason
of
a
price
different,
lower
than
--
than
it
is
outside
of
st.
louis
is
enough
to
violate
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
said
that
was
the
impression
i
said
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
--
do
i
understand
you
to
say
it
has
to
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
predatory
is
that
word
or
what
is
it?
does
it
have
to
be
predatory
or
does
is
it
have
to
be
doing
it
to
injure
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
somebody
as
the
word
was
used
or
hold
the
trouble
with
the
head?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
struck
to
mean
it's
our
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
find
out,
do
you
say
that
there
has
to
be
some
purpose
shown
to
do
evil
or
to
injure
competition?
