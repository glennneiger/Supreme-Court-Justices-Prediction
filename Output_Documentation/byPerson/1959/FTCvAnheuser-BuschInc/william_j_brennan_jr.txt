j.
brennan,

do
you
mean
by
that
as
a
pattern
of
what
he
was
saying
in
effect
to
us
at
the
regional
and
the
local
rate
made
increases
outside
of
st.
louis
that
normally
and
apparently
had
been
the
fact
then
that
ab
would
not
have
suffered
the
loss
of
the
markets
outside
of
saint
louis
which
made
it
necessary
to
indulge
in
this
experiment
in
st.
louis?

mr.
elman
made
the
observation
i
think
that
throughout
the
hearing,
the
examiner
tried
to
get
from
ab
an
answer
the
question
why
did
you
pick
st.
louis?
if
you
were
suffering
lost
sales
outside
of
saint
louis
when
the
regionals
didn't
go
though
when
you
went
up
why
didn't
go
out
to
try
your
experiment
somewhere
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
wanted.
what
was
the
answer?
