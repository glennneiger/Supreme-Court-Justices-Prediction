justice
felix
frankfurter
we'll
just
destroy
it
from
illusions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
completely
--
completely
if
falstaff
had
cut
its
price
still
lower,
that
would
present
a
different
problem,
would
it?
justice

mr.
--
mr.
elman,
no
doubt
anheuser-busch
has
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
the
rest
of
my
question
is
i
doubt
that
there's
a
good
answer,
though
i
can't
keep
it
to
myself.
there
has
to
be
(inaudible)
but
my
attention
(inaudible)
the
italicizing
of
that
market
in
this
court's
opinion.
no
doubt
anheuser-busch
is
engaged
in
commerce,
but
the
discrimination
must
be
to
lessen
competition
or
tend
to
clear
the
monopoly
in
any
line
of
commerce.
now,
is
the
sale
of
beer
in
st.
louis
a
line
of
commerce?
is
the
sale
of
beer
in
st.
louis
a
line
of
commerce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
i
thought
your
whole
argument
was
that
the
effect
of
commerce
outside
the
locality
of
the
material
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
--
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
jurisdiction.
i'm
talking
about
whether
the
discrimination
accepting
your
analysis
in
st.
louis
tends
to
create
a
monopoly
or
lessens
competition
in
commerce
because
the
whole
argument
is
that
this
doesn't
touch
anything
outside
of
the
st.
louis
market.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
lessen
competition
outside
of
st.
louis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
does
the
punishment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
does
the
--
does
the
punishment
touche
their
competitive
position
in
commerce?
i'm
asking
you.
i
don't
see
how
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
say
that
you
need
to
look
at
the
effect
outside
of
st.
louis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow
that
but
i
don't
yet
see
how
if
it
is
irrelevant
because
not
such
that
the
competitive
relation
is
unaffected
by
the
lowering
of
price
in
st.
louis.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
outside
of
st.
louis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
findings
that
that
would
be
determinative?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
--
were
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
think
i
have
to
be
more
concrete.
that
may
be
satisfied
by
proving
that
they
wanted
to
punish
them
in
the
st.
louis
market.
my
question
is,
were
there
findings
which
you
already
are
just
sustaining
to
go
back,
that
this
would
affect
the
competitive
relationship
of
the
anheuser-busch
with
their
three
competitors
outside
of
st.
louis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
such
findings.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
merely
want
some
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
the
federal
trade
commission
make
an
explicit
finding
that
the
price
was
lowered
not
below
cost
but
was
lowered
so
drastically
in
order
to
bludgeon
or
refuse
the
word
to
bludgeon
a
rival
competitor
out
of
existence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
understood
--
i
may
have
misunderstood,
but
i
understood
the
word
bludgeon
wasn't
used,
more
delicate
language
was
used
but
is
--
wasn't
it
–
isn't
that
government's
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
saying
that
there
was
because
that
involves
your
colloquy
with
the
chief
justice
as
to
what
findings
were
incorporated
in
the
commission's
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
just
wondered
as
to
whether
you
would
agree
that
there
could
be
discrimination
in
the
center
of
price
lowering
which
is
not
so
obviously,
say
what
you
call
unfair
namely
that
it's
--
it
doesn't
even
cover
the
out-of-pocket
expenses,
you
would
agree
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
rests
on
--
on
facts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
argument
really
is
that
this
court
hasn't
before
it
the
finding
or
determination
by
the
federal
trade
commission
that
this
was
punitive
move
by
anjeuser-busch.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
--
that's
not
a
legal
question,
that's
--
that's
reading
the
record
and
finding
out
what
really
is
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
that
isn't
illegal.
that's
also
illegal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
cutting
--
was
cutting
below
the
normal
profit,
whatever
that
is,
i
know
that
it
specially
is
termed
but
cutting
very,
very
below
the
normal
profit
which
the
cutter
could
well
stand
for
long
period
but
his
rivals
can't,
could
that
be
found,
if
not
would
it
not
be
fairly
be
would
that
be
found
--
could
that
be
found
by
the
commission
to
have
punitive
purpose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it
is
below
cost
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
or
have
you
argued,
if
so
i
missed
it,
but
are
you
arguing
that
if
the
record
should
be
interpreted
to
disclose
those
findings
by
the
commission
that
this
is
a
punitive
foray
or
punitive
movement
are
you
arguing
that
the
--
that
your
evidence
before
the
commission
did
not
warrant
such
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
are
you
–
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
no
use
for
them
to
argue
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
thought
of
it.
