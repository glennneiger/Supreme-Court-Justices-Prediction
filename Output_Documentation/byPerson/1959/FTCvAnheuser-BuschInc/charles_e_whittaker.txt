do
you

whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles

whittaker
i
was
--
justice

about
to
ask
you,
if
the
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
even
on
the
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
--
but
the
finding
does
have
to
supported
by
evidence?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
i
would
like
to
ask
you
if
i
may
please
just
this,
addressing
my
attention
first
to
the
competition
between
sellers,
is
it
your
position
that
because
anheuser-busch
reduced
prices,
but
never
too
less
than
falstaff
and
griesedieck
in
the
st
louis
area,
it's
legally
possible
that
a
finding
of
discrimination
is
yet
sustainable
on
the
record.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright
now
then
number
two,
is
it
your
position
that
because
anheuser-busch
sells
beer
at
$3.15
per
case
in
philadelphia,
a
thousand
miles
in
north
from
st.
louis
and
at
the
same
time
sold
it
in
st.
louis
at
$2.93
a
case
that
there
is
a
discrimination
between
purchasers
which
may
tend
to
the
lessen
competition
at
either
market?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
i
--
as
i
understand
the
statute.
it
makes
in
one
package
a
discrimination
between
purchasers
unlawful
where
the
effect
is
to
substantially
lessen
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly.
so
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes
i
know
it,
but
the
discrimination
is
not
simply
because
there
is
a
difference
unlawful
unless
it's
in
the
case
were
the
effect
is
the
condemned
one,
isn't
that
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
