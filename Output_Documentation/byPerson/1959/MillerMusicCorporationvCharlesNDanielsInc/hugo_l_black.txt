it's
kind
of
training
language
a
little,
the
executor
may
have
a
legal
title
but
it's
not
for
the
executor.
as
i
understand
it,
he's
arguing,
it
goes
to
the
people
that
the
executor
was
represented
the
next
of
kin.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
suppose
he's
arguing
the
executor
gets
and
keep
it
for
his
own
advantage,
does
he?
justice

black
he
--
he
can
do
it.
justice

that's
right.that's
the

(voice

you
say
while
ago
but
it's
made
and
he
has
a
wife
really.
what
did
i
understand
you
to
say
about
that?
justice

and
what
about
the
assignment
if
he
has
a
wife
then?
justice

black
and
then
the
children.
justice

what?

well

for
getting

i
want
to
move
on

definitely
that
deals
because
i
don't
quite
understand
your
distinction.
yes,
do
you
say
that
the
wife
and
children
and
what
about
the
next
of
kin
when
you
go
down
and
he
has
no
will?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
he
fails
to
leave
a
will.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they'd
have
to
get
it.
is
the
assignment
good
against
them?
justice

black
not
good
against
them.
justice

is
it
any
different?

(voice

justice

black
is
there
any
difference
in
that
in
practical
effect
in
the
claim
of
the
executor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
claim
of
the
executor
of
course
would
be
for
whoever
the
beneficiaries
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
other
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
other
question,
i
don't
get
quite
understand.
do
you
draw,
i
understand,
or
does
the
other
side
draw
any
distinction
between
the
right
of
the
next
of
kin
and
the
executor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
the
next
of
kin?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
well,
do
i
understand
then
that
they
say
that
it
doesn't
defeat
the
right
of
the
next
of
kin?
they
can
get
it
if
he
makes
no
will
despite
the
assignment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
makes
a
will,
he
somehow
cuts
off
the
beneficiaries
even
if
they
are
the
next
of
kin?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that,
suppose
he
had
made
his
next
of
kin
the
beneficiary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
this
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
gives
the
right
--
what
i'm
--
i
--
i
couldn't
quite
understand
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
next
of
kin
by
reason
of
this
statute
cannot
be
cutoff
by
the
assignment,
why
can
those
be
cutoff
from
the
executor,
represents
as
the
executor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
about
the
executor,
they
only
passed
it
to
him
if
--
if
he
did
exercise
his
testamentary
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
say
--
what
you're
saying
then
here
is
that
all
we
have
here
is
a
case
where
the
right
time
the
contract
was
not
drawn
and
it's
probably
this
case,
it's
empower
to
be
granted
i
suppose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
having
been
that
here,
a
question
of
how
you're
going
to
construe
a
contract
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
suppose
one
--
suppose
one
disagrees
with
your
interpretation
of
the
contract,
have
you
any
argument
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
--
i
--
i
want
that
clear.
do
you
understand
that
the
witmark
case
held
that
--
and
you're
barred
from
challenging
it
on
that
term
that
a
man
in
his
lifetime
would
make
an
assignment
which,
of
his
bar
or
to
those
claims.
he
died
having
tried
to
make
it
a
--
make
a
will
after
that
to
give
it
to
somebody
else.
and
you
understand
that
the
witmark
case
holds
that
he
could
not
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
i'm
asking
him
because
i
--
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
a
little
confused
by
quite
different
to
my
brother,
i'm
a
little
confused
in
that
position
by
the
statements
you
made.
i
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
say
as
the
lawfulness
this
assignment
to
be
made
so
then
take
effect
so
as
to
bar
the
executor
claiming
the
rights.
i
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
say
it
has
got
to
be
in
certain
kind
of
language
with
reference
to
the
appointment
itself.
i
find
that
a
little
difficult.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
find
it
far
more
difficult
than
i
would
maybe
it's
because
i
just
said
it
in
the
other
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
--
somewhat
believe
that
the
mere
fact
if
the
case
held
there
could
be
an
assignment,
does
not
mean
now
that
i
have
to
say
that
it
also
deprives
the
man
of
making
a
will
which
would
designate
someone
else
to
receive
it.
i
had
not
understood
the
witmark
case
to
go
that
far,
maybe
it
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
no
doubt
about
black
acre.
i'm
not
saying
about
black
acre.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
thinking
about
this
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
gives
certain
people
the
right
in
all
their
name
to
do
certain
things
and
that's
all
i
--
the
black
acre
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
couldn't
get
me
anywhere.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
is
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
may
i
ask
you
what
your
position
means
that
your
assignment
would
also
cutoff
the
next
of
kin
had
there
been
no
will?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
had
not
had
one,
the
man
had
died
without
a
will.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
not
be
good?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
also
the
statute
says
that
he
makes
a
will
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
his
executor
gets
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
executor
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
he
is
--
in
other
words,
if
a
man
doesn't
make
a
will,
it
goes
to
next
of
kin
despite
your
assignment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
unless
you
get
from
--
i
mean
you
--
you
can't
overwrite
the
rights
of
the
next
of
kin.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
while
you
were
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
he
does
make
a
--
but
if
he
does
make
a
will,
then
it's
no
good.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
--
the
--
i'm
not
talking
about
next
of
kin
he
does
make
a
will
and
decides
he
wants
to
give
it
to
the
next
of
kin
and
somebody
else.
then
your
assignment
is
good
as
against
that
will.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
there
are
many
--
many
ways
they
could
have
made
it
clear.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
understand
that
here
you
say
that
in
the
first
place,
it
would
go
to
the
widow
and
the
children.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
assignment
could
cut
it
off?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
next
class
they
make
is
an
executor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
that
is
cutoff
by
society.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
by
your
assignment
to
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
the
--
is
the
will
any
good
does
--
does
anybody
get
anything
from
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
point
of
assignment
you
speak
of.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
even
though
he
didn't
try
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
name
you
as
--
did
the
will
name
you
as
the
beneficiary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
then
the
second
class
is
the
executor.
now,
the
third
class
which
comes
even
after
that
is
why
they
have
no
will?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
your
assignment
is
no
good
against
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
just
plain
language.
