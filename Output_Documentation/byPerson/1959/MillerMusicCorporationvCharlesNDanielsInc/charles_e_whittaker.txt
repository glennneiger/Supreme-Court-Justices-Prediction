justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
argue,
if
i
may
ask
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
that
the
act
of
the
next
of
kin,
the
brothers,
in
joining
in
conveyance
of
any
interest
they
might
have
or
after
it
acquired,
is
binding
upon
the
residuary
legatees
who
are
their
children
under
the
laws
of
descent
to
under
this
will.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand
your
position,
it
is
this.
if
--
if
i
do
correctly
understand,
that
the
wife
and
children
are
made
preferred
statutory
beneficiaries
of
this
renewal
right
during
the
period
of
the
last
year,
if
the
author
has
earlier
died.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that
the
right
if
--
that
is
a
wife
and
child
as
--
as
to
the
hands
of
the
executor,
if
there
(inaudible)
and
if
none,
his
assets
in
the
hands
of
the
administrator
and
set
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
i
will
get
to
that
later.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
assets
in
the
hands
of
the
executor,
if
there's
--
is
one
and
if
not,
assets
in
the
hands
of
the
administrator
through
whom
the
errors
of
law,
the
next
of
kin,
acquire
the
property,
is
that
wrong?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
i
may
ask
you,
is
there
any
rule
that
--
is
there
any
rule
that
this
asset
is
subject
to
appropriation
for
the
payment
of
creditor's
debts?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
ever,
in
taking
these
assignments,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
and
to
the
covenant
that
the
composer
shall
by
his
will,
if
he
makes
one
confirm
the
assignment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
but
then
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you've
mentioned
also
that
--
you
made
some
comment
about
the
fact
that
the
executor
was
the
decedent's
brother,
is
that
a
matter
of
consequence
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words,
the
--
if
i
cannot
--
the
executor
is
the
trustee,
as
i
understand
you,
to
carry
out
the
directions
of
the
will
and
a
trustee
has
no
beneficial
interest,
but
only
legal
title
and
beneficial
interest
is
vested
in
the
beneficiary.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
this
court
has
held
in
gift
tax
cases
namely,
on
the
number
of
occasions.
now,
gives
to
trustees
of
more
than
$3000
for
multiple
donees,
when
each
has
a
$3000
exemption
have
been
held
be
gifts
to
the
beneficiaries,
not
to
the
trustee
and
there
maybe
taken
as
many
deductions
as
there
are
beneficiaries.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
normally
an
executor
is
more
than
a
conduit
though.
he
has
legal
title
and
he
must
administer
property
and
if
necessary,
sell
it
to
pay
debts
etcetera,
use
some
more
than
a
conduit.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
think
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
think
you
take
care
of
the
package
by
calling
him
just
what
he
is,
that
the
executor,
a
trustee.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
the
case
then,
as
i
understand
it,
where
the
right
died
with
the
person?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
which
expired
at
his
death.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
--
if
it's
a
power
of
appointment,
it's
nonetheless
to
the
executor
as
such,
is
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
were
those
of
my
brethren
and
he
thought
there
were
misconceptions
in
what
this
court
rules?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
in
this
connection,
mr.
rudin
please?
as
i
understand,
you
do
not
question
the
fact
that
the
author's
death
prior
to
the
28th
year
leaving
neither
wife
nor
child
ended
all
rights
to
renewal
but
that
something
the
right
did
continue.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
appointment
you
say
was
that
--
that
the
right
to
leave
it
to
the
executor
was
in
the
power
--
a
power
of
appointment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now
let's
see.
the
statute
says
that
the
author
of
the
work
if
still
living
or
the
widow,
widower
or
children
of
the
author
if
the
author
be
not
living
now
or
if
such
author,
widow,
widower
or
children
be
not
living,
then
the
author's
executors.
or
in
the
absence
of
will,
the
next
of
kin
shall
have
this
right
of
renewal.
now
then,
do
you
say
that
the
death
of
the
testator
--
of
the
death
of
the
author
without
wife
or
child
prior
to
28th
year
extinguished
all
rights
of
renewal?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
didn't
something
survive
his
death
even
though
he
left
no
widow
or
child.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
would
have
to
make
some
distinction
that's
in
light
of
the
fact
you
don't
get.
you
say
that
those
two,
the
executor
here,
under
the
exercise
by
the
testator
of
a
power
of
appointment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
isn't
that
the
mere
name,
you
have
a
right
to
any
--
any
executor's
requirements
field,
the
exercise
of
the
power
of
appointment
in
the
sense
you
used
that
term.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
of
course
the
executor
appears
on
the
will
--
will
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
and
with
the
power
of
appointment,
the
sanction
here
is
that
power
to
name
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
you
mean
that
true,
in
just
every
case
with
an
executor's
name?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what's
the
difference
between
this
and
in
the
other
(voice
overlap)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
any
asset.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
revisable
asset?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
is
--
is
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
--
is
that
to
say
that
you're
here,
this
is
just
to
construe
a
contract,
is
that
to
say
that
you
do
not
regard
section
24
as
ambiguous?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
down
this
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
down
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
feel
bound
to
say
i
agree
with
you.
i
do
not
think
the
statute
is
ambiguous
as
related
to
our
question.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
--
that
so
even
though
the
author
died
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
28th
year
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
was
the
situation
in
the
fox
case.
so,
something
did
survive
through
the
executor.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
does
an
executor
at
least
normally
take
assets
in
his
hands
subject
to
valid
contracts
made
with
the
testator?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
does
that
apply
to
copyrights,
i
don't
know?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
let
me
ask
you
if
i
may
sir.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
want
to
get
back
to
this
administrator
business.
do
you
know
of
any
law
of
decent
under
any
state
in
the
country
that
does
not
with
respect
to
chattels
leave
them
to
next
of
kin
describing
they
may
be
perhaps.
but
do
they
not
all
do
that
and
yet
or
not
every
such
is
not
every
such
asset
an
asset
in
the
hands
of
the
administrator
there
being
no
will?
then
do
you
still
maintain
that
these
assets
if
it
survives
and
there
be
no
will,
is
not
an
asset
in
the
hands
of
the
administrator?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
have
to
take
it
in
a
way
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
to
keep
any
inconsistency
of
the
statute
and
the
statute
full
read
is
perfectly
plain,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
is
to
me.
