mr.
julian
t.
abeles
--
district
court
held
that
if
the
author
did
not
survive
the
28th
year,
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
acquired
by
the
executor.
he
had
nothing
to
leave.
and
of
course,
out
of
the
--
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
upon
the
determine
--
upon
the
decision
of
judge
bryant.
now,
judge
bryant
and
also
the
respondent,
cite
in
support
of
this
contention,
two
authorities.
that
is
two
--
rather
two,
i
would
say,
two
textbook
writers,
two
copyright
textbook
writers.
one,
ball
another
known
as
ladas,
and
if
i
may
respectfully
do
so,
ball
says
in
accord
with
what
they
contend,
“when
can
i
grant
personal
property
in
which
he
has
no
existing
title
of
vested
right?”
consequently,
an
expectancy
and
a
drawing
out
of
property
cannot
be
the
subject
of
an
assignment
at
law
of
a
valid
mortgage
sale,
nor
be
devised
by
will.
and
ladas
answered
the
same
effect,
the
author
cannot
dispose
the
rights,
he
may
never
have.
now,
as
i
said
yesterday,
in
--
in
fox
film
against
knowles,
the
precise
contention
was
raised
and
the
court
of
appeals,
in
affirming
said,
“that
while
they
recognize
there
could
be
no
distinction
between
an
assignment
by
the
author
or
divide
--
or
devise
that
he
can,
having
not
survived
the
28th
year,
he
could
do
neither.”
in
this
court,
i
will
say
it
that,
this
court
in
a
--
in
a
reversing
said,
that
as
the
--
as
the
executor
represents
a
person
of
his
testator
in
the
absence
of
a
widow
and
child,
he
can
exercise
the
same
power
that
the
testator
might
exercise
if
he
had
been
alive.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
well,
that
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
a
page,
your
honor,
they
referred
to
and
that's
the
only
thing
i
could
find
on
that
page
that
has
any
reference
to
it.
he
does
say
that
it
can't
do
either
one.
i
don't
know.
i
just
cite
that.
i
don't
know,
why
you
say,
he
can't
assign
or
can't
divide
--
make
of
clash,
but
that's
what
they
say,
they
cite
that.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
they
cite
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
i
don't
know
where
he
got
it
from,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
it
just
seemed
to
be
an
off-hand
statement,
i
think
on
his
own,
i
can't
understand
why
you
made
it,
if
i
may
say
so.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
no
sir.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
it
isn't
so,
either
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
it's
not
so
as
to
copyright,
either
if
will
point
out.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
i
can't
understand
why
judge
bryant
said
the
same
thing.
after
all
these
decisions
in
copyright,
decisions
of
this
court
as
i
point
out.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
well,
in
fox
film
against
knowles,
if
the
court
--
this
court
did
say,
that
the
--
the
--
this
--
this
section
24
clearly
evidence
the
fact
that
the
executor
does
represent
the
person
of
his
testator.
that
seems
to
be
pretty
strong
and
that
in
the
absence
of
a
widow
or
child
of
course,
because
widow
or
child
must
come
--
it
can
be
--
can
do
nothing
to
deprive
them
of
the
right,
of
course,
i'm
pointing
out.
in
their
absence
--
of
widow
or
a
child,
sir,
that
he
can
exercise
the
same
power
that
the
testator
might've
exercised
(inaudible).
that
seems
to
be
pretty
strong.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
and
judge
bryant
says
approximately
the
same
thing,
may
i
respectfully
say
so.
now,
in
the
case
of
(inaudible)
in
that
case,
the
determination
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
second
circuit
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
ladas,
well,
yes.
i
have
that
here
in
the
--
ladas
says
--
well
he
says
this.
it
seems
to
be
the
same
effect,
if
i
respectfully
say
so.
the
author
cannot
dispose
the
rights
that
they
never
have.
so,
he
uses
the
words
“disposed
of”
it
seems
to
me
doesn't
--
it
seems
to
me,
i
should
think
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
right.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
right.
he
goes
more
into
the
copyright.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
that's
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
shall
i
proceed,
sir?
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
unless
i
say,
if
you
still
want
to
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
i
understand.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
i
see
what
you
mean,
the
--
ladas
does
affirm
that
too
until
the
author
of
ball
does
not
specifically
refer
the
--
he
said
it
makes
a
general
statement
of
property,
that's
correct.
now,
this
case
i
was
mentioning
before
if,
i
may
proceed.
the
(inaudible)
the
determination
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
second
circuit
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
now,
in
that
case,
the
author
had
left
his
renewal
interest
to
his
hometown
in
gaborone,
i'm
sorry,
to
gaborone,
and
the
contention
there
was
that
--
that
is
the
--
the
next
of
kin
came
and
they
were
the
ones
who
were
posing
it.
they
said
that
the
sole
right
that
the
author
has
is
to
name
the
executor,
apply
for
renewal.
but
that
he
cannot
possibly,
he
has
nothing
and
that
he
can't
--
to
transfer
or
that
is,
authorize
the
executor
to
act
for
--
to
act
in
respect
of.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
what
they
did,
sir,
was
that
all
--
all
people
in
the
music
field
under
that
film,
the
motion
picture
films
of
a
(inaudible).
they
--
they
all
do
this.
you
see
were
a
man
houses
any
wife
or
a
child,
they
get
the
assignment,
of
course,
from
the
author
and
that
is
to
find
out
who
is
next
of
kin
of
it.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
on
this
particular
case,
his
only
next
of
kin
was
his
three
brothers.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
so,
they
said,
“you
have
to
get
them
to
sign,”
which
he
did.
they
transferred
all
rights
and
they're
just
not
here
after
no
one
existed
and
agreed
to
execute
such
further
documents.
they'd
be
necessary
for
the
purpose
affecting
those
right.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
if
one
of
his
brothers
qualifies
to
the
executor
and
turns
over
this
property
to
his
spouse,
and
the
child
or
the
other
brothers.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
no.
the
--
the
fathers,
yes.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
--
and
the
three
brothers.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
they
were
saying,
he
left
to
the
(inaudible)
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
(inaudible)
specific
now,
so
he's
didn't
make
a
specific
request,
he
just
left
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
no.
i
don't
wish
to
say
that,
sir,
of
the
copyright
act,
because
what
we
do
is
we
get
him
to
sign
because
he
doesn't
make
a
will
--
we'll
protect
him.
we
always
assumed
under
fox
films
against
knowles,
if
he
didn't
make
a
will,
were
protective
because
the
executor
stand
in
the
shoes
of
his
testate.
that
was
our
theory.
we've
always
followed
that
throughout.
and
i
know
all
the
other
lawyers
would
feel
that.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
very
easy,
because
once
we
have
the
author
sign,
sir,
the
wife
would
rarely
sign
and
we
can
rarely
get
the
children,
we
found
that's
no
difficult.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
once
the
author
has
signed
over
--
that
is
--
assigned
his
renewal
interest
to
the
publisher,
to
the
motion
picture
company
or
whoever
it
is,
they
find
there's
no
difficulty,
later
on,
as
a
man
does
--
may
--
to
have
a
man
get
his
wife
to
execute
a
separate
instrument
of
assigning
her
rights
or
if
he
has
children,
we
could
--
we
find
that
very
--
but
because
of
this
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
i
think
so,
because
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
well,
i
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
we
take
that
in
--
let
me
put
it
this
way
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
--
if
i
might,
i
--
don't
misunderstand
me
saying
this,
sir.
usually,
an
author
when
they
were
(inaudible)
comes
up,
he's
pretty
well
up
in
years
and
our
experience
has
been,
he
doesn't
usually
marry
after
that.
a
lot
of
the
authors,
famous
authors,
never
did
marry
men
and
women.
i'm
surprised
and
that's
the
reason
kinds
of
case
becomes
so
important
in
the
field.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
unless,
i
got
the
wife
and
child,
i
wouldn't
have
anything.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
i
wouldn't
have
--
no.
the
--
we
wouldn't
have
anything
from
the
author
because
you
cannot
--
he
cannot
take
the
rights
away
from
the
wife
and
child.
that's
a
compulsory
request
as
this
court
held.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
no
question
about
it.
you
see,
our
difficulty
is,
sir,
this
position.
we
cannot
go
to
the
executor.
we
can
go
to
the
wife
and
go
to
the
children.
we
can't
go
to
the
executor
because
the
executor
has
to
take
an
office.
he
won't
take
it,
if
a
man
dies.
so
he
is
in
far
greater
position
than
the
wife
and
the
children.
he
never
intended
that,
i'm
sure.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
in
this
way,
sir,
and
as
this
court
has
--
has
pointed
out
in
the
--
in
the
de
sylva
case,
yes.
de
sylva-ballentine,
i'll
get
there
in
a
second.
you
see
it
--
it
names
the
--
it
names
the
wife
and
the
children
first.
but
that
he
says,
if
there
are
no
action
showed
and
then
the
--
the
other
calls
the
executor.
in
other
words,
the
way
the
statute
works
is
this,
he
cannot
take
away
this
right
of
the
wife
and
child.
it's
a
compulsory
request
to
them.
it's
for
their
protection
after
he
dies.
but
if
--
what
if
he
has
no
wife
and
child,
then
they
give
him
the
right
to
dispose
of,
they
don't
care
how
he
disposes
that.
he
dispose
it
by
request
or
by
assignment
or
otherwise.
but
if
he
doesn't,
then
i
suppose,
so
that
he
won't
go
into
the
public
domain
and
who
--
whoever
is
next
of
kin
maybe
scattered
through
out
the
world
or
otherwise,
they've
held
that
this
next
of
kin
do
acquire
the
right,
if
they
apply
for
it
within
their
28th
year.
but
you
see,
the
wife
and
children
are
mandatory
because
they're
before
the
executor.
in
other
words,
the
executor
can't
--
the
--
of
the
author
cannot
step
in
so
through
the
executor
unless
there
is
no
wife
or
child.
he
cannot
take
that
away
from
them.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
could
i
have
a
little
water
please?
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
(voice
overlap)
can
i
take
this?
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
thank
you.
pardon
me
sir,
would
you
mind?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
no,
not
the
administrator,
no.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
not
the
administrator
may
i
say
so
please,
not
the
administrator.
no,
just
the
executor.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
and
then
the
wife
or
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
and
i
--
i
was
wrong
with
that,
his
assets
are
--
that's
correct,
sir.
i
was
sorry.
but
what
i
meant
was
because
the
renewal
of
copyright,
we
go
then,
to
the
next
of
kin.
you
said
assets
which
are
correct,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
everything
about
the
renewals.
not
the
renewal,
sir.
an
administrator
cannot
exercise
any
rights
through
renewal.
you
see,
they
only
say
exactly,
don't
say
the
administrator,
so
as
to
know
exactly
goes
to
the
next
of
kin.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
right,
sir.
because
it
said,
i
--
i
probably
didn't
make
that
clear.
i
should
have
said
that
the
statute
says
in
the
absence
of
a
will,
see,
that's
my
mistake.
in
the
absence
of
a
will
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
--
then
the
next
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
--
yes
--
yes,
sir.
to
this
ground,
that
is
to
say
that
if
you
didn't
make
a
will,
which
a
lot
of
men
don't,
of
course,
one
reason
or
another,
then
it
goes
to
the
next
of
kin,
if
he
hasn't
got
a
wife
or
child.
and
that's
when
we
saw,
we
signup
the
next
of
kin.
it
would
find
it
for
itself
of
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
never
been
determined,
sir.
in
this
will,
of
course,
like
in
all
wills,
he
did
say
--
start
of
by
saying,
that
i
am
--
first
direct
a
payment
of
all
my
just
debts
and
obligations
and
so
forth.
they
might
come
under
that.
i've
never
--
i
have
raised
that
point,
it
might.
in
other
words,
it
would
seem
to
--
in
other
words,
though
indirectly,
i
would
say
that's
correct,
perhaps
directly.
because
our
position
is
exactly
as
i
said
before,
takes
through
the
author
and
the
author
haven't
made
an
assignment.
anything
the
executor
gets
is
subject
to
that
assignment,
because
he
takes
the
right
of
the
author,
he
must
take
him
subject
to
the
assignment.
that's
my
point.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes,
sir.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
well,
might
i
respectfully
state
that
i
don't
--
i
don't
have
to
jump
to
that
point,
because
if
there's
a
widow
or
children,
i
have
nothing
to
say.
that's
the
end
because
he
can
now
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
--
then
i
get
to
the
executor.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
sir?
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
there's
no
widow
or
children
here.
i
say
if
there
was
a
widow
or
child,
their
rights
would
go
to
them.
i
wouldn't
have
anything
through
the
--
my
assignment
when
the
author
has
a
--
cut
the
widow
child,
a
wife
and
child,
would
do
the
wife
now.
so,
don't
you
don't
see
judge
--
might
i
say,
that
it's
only
if
the
--
you
see
--
you
see,
i'm
--
somewhere
in
my
back
of
my
mind,
never
thought,
they
did
say
i
remember
now,
that
the
idea,
i
think,
you
mention
--
you
mention,
justice
--
justice
whittaker,
yes,
that
if
the
--
if
the
author
did
not
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
he
could
get
money
during
his
lifetime
by
disposing
of
these
rights,
then
make
a
will
or
not,
then
it
grant
of
course,
and
going
to
the
public
domain,
it
went
to
the
next
of
kin.
that
seems
to
be
the
idea.
i
recall
somewhere
i
read
that.
so,
in
other
words,
it's
protected
to
go
in
the
public
domain.
they
said
alright,
whoever
this
next
of
kin
are,
let
it
go
to
them.
and
that
was
the
idea.
but
don't
you
see
judge,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
there's
no
widow
or
a
child,
i'm
going
to
point
that
out.
that's
your
de
sylva
case.
this
court
specifically
held
in
that
case
that
in
the
absence
--
in
the
--
that
the
--
that
the
statute
is
a
mandatory
request
to
the
widower
and
child.
and
that
the
only
restriction
upon
the
assignment
of
the
author's
interest
in
the
renewal
is
for
the
protection
of
the
widow
and
child
in
the
form
of
compulsory
request,
is
there.
that
seems
to
be
quite
important.
i
guess
then
that's
the
de
sylva
case.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
pardon
me.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
right.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes,
sir.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
what
the
judge
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
what
--
what
judge
washington
said.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes,
sir.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
well,
i
don't
come
to
the
--
i
don't
have
to
come
to
the
next
of
kin.
i
think,
i
didn't
get
that
far
in
this
case,
sir.
you
see,
there's
no
way
to
it
and
yet,
as
i
say
is
compulsory
request
to
the
widow
and
child.
that
was
the
idea
of
the
statute.
they
--
to
protect
them
--
but
therefore,
the
author
can
do
nothing
to
dispose
of
them
without
a
right.
and
if
he
has
his
widow
or
child,
it
goes
to
them,
no
question
about
it,
but
if
he
didn't,
then
he
has
a
right,
why
not.
in
other
words,
why
shouldn't
he
enjoy
that
during
his
lifetime?
here's
a
man
who's
unmarried,
he
has
no
wife
or
child,
he
has
nobody
particularly
he
cares
of
by
worrying
about
taking
care
of
perhaps.
and
so,
they
say
let
him
enjoy
during
his
lifetime,
say
comes
to
a
public,
he
comes
to
motion
picture
company,
stage
producing
company,
he
gets
them
for
a
very
large
sums
of
money
for
these
rights
and
enjoys
them.
but
what
should
--
why
shouldn't
he?
i
mean,
should
it
go
to
some
next
of
kin
he
doesn't
care
about
in
faraway
lands
or
wherever
they
are,
i
mean
some
--
there,
the
third
cousins
of
somebody.
so
i
think
that's
the
idea.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
only
under
the
condition
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
right.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
well,
because
--
well,
this
--
this
court
said
in
the
de
sylva
case
sir,
that
the
--
for
the
reason
the
statute
plainly
imports
that
his
protection
of
the
widow
and
children,
that
was
the
uppermost
state
of
their
mind
of
--
of
congress,
and
that
they
intend
to
protect
the
widow
and
children
if
they
wanted,
but
they
weren't
--
then
they
gave
the
man
the
right
to
dispose
of
by
assignment
or
request.
he
could
enjoy
that
during
his
lifetime.
but
if
he
didn't
make
an
assignment
or
if
he
didn't
make
a
will
however,
you
see
by
in
another
case,
you
held
that
the
--
in
the
fisher
--
fisher
against
witmark
case
you
held
(inaudible)
--
to
appoint
a
special
committee
which
is
(inaudible)
committee
with
reference
to
the
statute
in
which
they
--
in
which
they
said,
that
in
the
absence
of
a
widow
or
child,
then
to
the
--
then
it
permits
the
author
to
designate
by
will,
the
executor
to
apply
for
the
renewal.
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
no
widow
or
child,
the
man
can
do
what
he
wants
to
that's
his
--
it's
his
--
he
can
go
ahead
then.
he
could
let
him
get
the
benefit
of
it.
but
if
he
doesn't
do
so,
then
they
don't
want
it
to
lapse
because
i'm
only
repeating
myself,
it
goes
to
next
of
kin
and
that's
the
distinction
between
the
three.
they
--
they
really
done
this.
in
other
words,
two
only
comes
to
just
being
--
if
one
--
one,
isn't
there
wife
and
child,
one.
two,
exactly,
there
must
be
no
wife
and
child.
three,
the
next
of
kin
only
if
there
are
no
executors,
no
wills,
see?
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
i
gave
that
great
thought
as
far
as
you
--
as
far
as
you
brought
that
up,
because
that
has
never
sought
the
great
deal
of
discussion.
we
thought
it's
far
better
to
put
in
the
general
clause,
which
says,
if
he's
to
execute,
make
and
execute
any
or
all
further
documents,
is
because
the
rights
maybe
necessary
to
perfect
this,
if
this
rather
say
the
will
particularly
because
they
didn't
want
a
question
of
a
breach
of
--
of
contract
which
is
--
and
i
know
they
were
farfetched,
but
that
was
(inaudible)
and
i
thought
that
has
do
with
the
way
i
did.
i
might
be
wrong.
now,
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
did
i
mention
that?
i
think,
i
did,
did
i
not?
well
then,
it
will
only
take
me
a
second.
in
(inaudible)
as
i
said,
the
district
court's
determination
is
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
this
court
denied
certiorari.
in
that
case,
they
said,
a
man
had
left
a
family
will
--
left
the
[laughs]
the
renewal
to
his
hometown
of
(inaudible).
and
the
contention
was
that
he,
a
sole
right
that
--
that
an
author
has
is
a
name
the
executor
filed
for
the
renewal.
that
he
has
nothing
that
he
--
that
the
executor
is
in
no
position
to
act
for
him.
he
cannot
act
for
him.
and
therefore,
the
executor
was
compelled
to
turn
his
rights
so
it's
a
next
of
kin.
and
the
court
held
that
such
a
construction
would
deprive
the
author
of
the
right
to
dispose
of
his
renewal
if
his
contract
to
congressional
intent.
now,
in
the
fisher
against
witmark
case,
as
i
went
to
mention
before,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
made
a
various
--
history
--
exploitation
of
background,
explained
the
background
of
the
historical
background
of
this
section.
and
he
said
in
the
final
analysis
that
there
would
have
to
be
expressly
set
forth
in
the
statute,
something,
some
wordings,
somewhere,
to
prevent
the
author
to
make
an
assignment,
that
is
to
restrict
his
assignment.
of
course,
there's
in
that
case,
the
man
had
lived
--
he
had
lived
in
that
case
during
the
28th
year.
but
to
say,
but
that
they
contend,
you
see
it
in
a
away
that
contention
is
exactly
as
the
same
because
they
contended
that
prior
to
the
28th
year,
this
man
had
nothing
he
could
assign,
same
as
they
contend
here
and
judge
bryant
contended.
and
therefore,
even
though
he
took
out
the
renewal
in
the
28th
year,
he
didn't
have
anything
before
that
so
this
assignment
was
worthless.
but
the
--
this
court's,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
writing
the
opinion
said
to
the
contract,
that
it
would
have
to
be
expressed,
any
such
restraint
upon
the
assignment
and
that
it
certainly
was
not
manifest.
now,
of
course,
they
have
to
show
somewhere,
somehow,
that
the
executor
of
this
case
had
the
right,
his
brother,
to
effectuate
his
transfer
to
his
children,
the
children
of
his
elder
brothers.
they've
already
set,
of
course,
that
the
executor
requires
no
rights
whatsoever
from
the
testator,
because
the
testator
has
nothing
to
leave
up
to
the
28th
year
although
this
court
even
have
said
to
the
contrary.
now,
and
judge
bryant
said,
and
--
and
of
course
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
to
the
same
effect
by
(inaudible)
opinion,
that
the
rights
of
vest
--
vest
in
the
executor,
the
same
as
a
widow
or
the
children
next
of
kin
vest,
these
are
his
words.
and
he
says,
the
right
standards
solely
from
the
statute
independently,
of
any
right
of
the
author,
of
any
right
whatsoever
of
the
author.
and
might
i
say
that
judge
bryant
in
fact,
he
--
just
one
sentence,
he
speaks
of
defendant's
contention
which
he
(inaudible)
important
that
if
you
don't
mind,
i'll
read
this,
please
this
one
line.
defendant
contends,
this
is
at
page
28
of
the
record,
“defendant
contends
that
since
a
designated
person,
including
the
executor
derived
their
interest
solely
and
directly
from
the
statute,
the
author
may
not,
by
a
prior
assignment,
deprive
any
of
them
including
the
executor
of
the
right
which
a
statute
expressly
grants
to
them.”
in
other
words,
he
says
--
counsel
says
that
is
the
opinion
says,
i'm
sorry,
that
the
author
can't
tell
the
executor
what
he
must
do.
the
executor
is
entirely
independent
that's
the
judgment,
entirely
independent
of
the
rights
of
the
author.
he
gets
this
from
the
statute
do
it
to
what
he
please.
then
therefore,
the
author
could
do
nothing
to
deprive
the
executor
of
his
rights.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
says
that
is
true,
sir.[laughs]
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
and
i
wouldn't
be
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
i
wouldn't
be
here
though,
if
i
didn't
have
a
right
from
the
widow
because
i
have
--
the
widow
would
be
really
be
entitled
to
it.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
correct.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
what
i
meant,
yes.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
well,
i
wouldn't
say,
no.
of
course,
now,
from
a
legal
standpoint,
it's
just
rather
odd,
the
whole
situation,
might
it
put
it
that
way.
i
have
just
--
it
was
so
odd
what
happened
here,
i
mean,
here's
a
man,
gives
an
assignment,
we
take
it
in
good
faith,
he
goes
at
it
and
makes
a
will.
now,
he
might
have
--
i
don't
say,
i
don't
know.(inaudible)
he
didn't
make
a
specific
request
did.
of
this
--
of
this
--
no,
no
he
didn't
do
that.
so,
he
might
have
intended
that
we
get
under
will,
that
possible,
because
an
absence
of
brothers
just
is
shout
that
why
should
we
get
it.
after
all,
they'd
rather
turned
over
their
children.
that's
only
human.
that's
--
that's
a
human
(inaudible)
there's
another
point
i
like
to
further
say
along
the
same
lines
and
this
is
also
only
one
sentence.
on
page
11
of
the
respondent's
brief,
he
says
that
for
the
same
effect,
this
is
pretty
strong,
“the
statute
moreover,
is
not
one
which
describes
the
rules
for
the
test
connected
to
his
disposition,
instead
it
creates
a
new
and
independent
rights
which
are
owned
by
the
person
or
persons
discussed,
but
otherwise
the
executor
owns
a
right,
so
i
don't
know.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
i
don't
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
no.no,
it
goes
to
the
people
on
the
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
no.he
does
just
justifies
the
executor
(inaudible)
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that
officially
is
either
the
will
of
the
executor.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
not
the
next
of
kin.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
right.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
right.
but
i
just
sought
the
word,
only,
it's
rather
odd,
sir,
i
never
saw
he
used
with
respect
to
the
executor's
rights.
i
never
saw
the
word
“vest”
used,
even.
it's
never
--
that
got
into
penalty
of
any
rights
or
the
testator's
right
on,
i
didn't
think
it.
i
mean,
i
don't
know,
i
just
might
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
sure,
well,
for
instance
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
well,
may
i
say
this.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
an
the
executor
only
takes
in
trust,
he
doesn't
own
these
rights
and
if
i
might
use
that
term,
you
--
you
understand
i'm
using,
i
mean
oh,
you
know
own
means
so
that
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
--
means
are
beneficial
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
not
intended
to
be
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
right,
sir.
i
say
that
the
man
having
made
an
assignment
as
a
--
as
judge
washington
said
that
the
executor
is
bound
without
assignment.
in
other
words,
that
the
author
can
dispose
of
either
by
assignment
or
request
and
certainly
by
assignment
so
he
can
enjoy
during
this
lifetime,
as
he
had
with
widow
and
child.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
precisely,
if
i
may
say
so.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
as
one
that
your
honors
mentioned
before,
the
executors
in
the
same
category
of
the
wife
and
child
and
the
next
of
kin,
that
people
who
get
his
rights
directly,
it's
their
property.
the
executor
decides
as
--
decides,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
he
--
he
just
acts
for
the
purposes
of
conduct,
i
think
that
word
was
used
also.
it's
a
conduct
for
the
purposes
of
affecting
the
disposition
by
the
author,
that's
all.
he
doesn't
own
these
rights,
they're
not
really
vested
on
him
and
certainly,
he
didn't
get
him
the
independently
of
any
rights
of
the
author,
sir.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
well,
the
--
you
understood
how
i
used
that
word,
i'm
sure.
i
--
i
--
to
the
way
i
used
it,
i
meant
was,
sir,
not
in
the
various
statement
he
had
to
do,
but
i
meant
in
the
disposition
of
the
property.
in
the
actual
property,
in
these
case,
had
taken
and
there
were
no
alignments
that
he
--
and
disposition
of
a
known
interest,
the
actual
use
of
conduct
if
i
may
use
that
word.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
in
other
words,
he
has
a
means
of
affecting
the
disposition
by
the
author,
i'll
put
it
that
way,
i'm
sorry,
i
used
the
word
(inaudible)
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
pardon
me
a
second.
(inaudible)
i
think,
i
mentioned
before,
but
i'll
repeat
it,
that
in
fisher
against
witmark,
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
congressional
committee
--
in
the
report
of
congressional
committee,
which
was
adopted
by
the
senate
committee,
where
they
--
they
said,
has
intention
of
the
statute
to
permit
the
author
who
had
no
widow
or
children
decreed
by
will
to
the
rights
to
apply
for
the
renewal
as
we
say
to
effectuate
the
disposition
there
of
the
renewal
rights
on
behalf
of
the
author.
now,
counsel
argues,
brings
up
the
argument
that
on
the
same
lines
that
the
chief
justice
mentioned
before
and
that
is,
he
says,
that
we
have
to
take
the
risk,
it's
a
gamble
he
says.
we
can't
complain.
he
says,
“alright,
you
took
these
rights
from
this
man,
he
had
no
wife
or
child,
and
never
mind
his
age
or
what
he
could
have
married
maybe
had
a
child
and
therefore,
you
lost
him
anyhow,
so
what
difference
does
it
make?
that's
a
risk
you
take,
it's
a
gamble.”
but
as
i
said
before,
we
found
as
a
practical
proposition,
we
have
no
difficulty
once
you've
gotten
from
the.
often,
you
can
understand
that,
if
he
will
get
the
wife
and
the
child.
also
to
transfer
of
the
rights
over
to
us
and
we
found
that
to
be
no
difficulty
as
they
said.
now,
but
the
--
but
what
he
doesn't
justify
is
this,
this
is
a
big
point,
i
think.
that
is
how
can
an
author
as
in
this
case,
who
has
made
an
assignment
by
his
own
deliberate
act,
defeat
that
assignment
by
making
a
will
and
disposing
these
rights
contrary
to
his
prior
disposition
--
and
derogation,
i
should
say,
this
prior
disposition.
now,
judge
bryant
said,
that
he
recognizes
that
this
maybe
in
congress.
judge
washington
says,
“it's
not
only
in
congress,
but
in
truth,
out
any
legal
justification.”
now,
as
this
court
said
in
national
labor
relations
board
against
the
lion
oil
company,
in
which
they
referred
to
the
prior
opinion
in
that
--
that
--
master
plastics,
the
fact
that
it
also
against
national
labor
relations
board.
they
said
that,
“we
have
caution
against
accepting
a
construction
of
a
statute
where
a
--
which
were
produced
and
in
congress
result.”
now,
in
closing,
i
--
i
think
i
should
mention
this,
i
don't
think
it
has
a
legal
significance,
but
he
makes
quite
a
point
of
it,
the
counsel
does
in
his
briefs
so,
i
think
i'll
be
permitted
to
answer,
if
i
may.
he
says
in
this
case,
15
years
ago,
“we
only
gave
$1000
advance
for
this
kind
against
royalties,
of
course,
therefore,
this
composition
and
several
others
--
i
cant
see
how
the
compositions
meant
nothing,
because
the
fact,
this
is
the
only
one
we're
fighting
over.
but
that
was
15
years
ago
and
the
cost
today,
if
i
respect
--
and
might
say
so,
as
counsel
for
the
music
publishers
association
which
--
to
the
membership
which
comprises
i
believe
all
leading
publishers
in
the
united
states.
(inaudible)
motion
picture
companies,
i
know
in
my
own
knowledge,
the
very,
very
substantial
sums
of
money
have
been
paid
to
the
last
10
years
for
their
proposition
of
renewal
rights
upon
the
supposition
over
fox
films
against
knowles
and
fisher
against
witmark,
there
would
be
no
question
that
that
assigment
would
be
valid.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
but
as
i
said,
sir,
that
was
a
$1000
advance
against
--
that
was
15
years
ago.
in
those
days,
they
didn't
pay
him
very
much
but
all
of
a
sudden,
they
have
a
right
with
association
music
and
they
send
letters
around.
this
association
said,
“don't
--
don't
let
--
don't
let
writers,
don't
go
direct
to
the
publisher,
come
to
us,
we'll
get
you
big
money,”
and
they
do.
we
pay
today
$10,000,
$15,000,
$25000,
$50,000
as
a
bonus
for
a
very
important
song
and
the
motion
picture
rights
goes
into
six
figures.
one,
going
at
the
wind
which
this
case
depends
on,
they
had
to
take
a
renewal.
this
woman,
she
--
she
was
this
writer,
she
didn't
have
any
husband,
no
children,
they
took
her
renewal
quite
loosely,
under
my
advice.
if
i
lose
this
case
just
to
bad
for
me
that's
all.
but
they
paid
(inaudible)
of
the
--
you
--
you
probably
call
gone
at
the
wind.
they
want
to
reissue
this
very
valuable
piece
of
property.
i
respect
to
submit
that
the
judgments
be
reversed.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
might
i
respect
to
state
(inaudible)
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
--
to
declare
what
these
(inaudible)
decide
that.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
i'm
sorry,
counsel
inadvertently
said
that
in
the
fisher
case
the
--
the
court
had
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
man
had
died
and
that
depended
upon
whether
or
not
he
lived
for
the
assignment
to
take
effect.
i
respectfully
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes
he
did.
but
you
see
if
you
--
if
you
please,
it
says
that
the
petition
for
certiorari
--
said
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
stated
the
sole
question
as
whether
an
agreement
to
assign
his
renewal
made
by
an
author
advanced
to
the
28th
year,
the
original
term
of
the
copyright
is
valid
and
forceful.
now,
(inaudible)
the
court
decide
that
it
was
not.
thank
you
so
much.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
the
--
that
assignment
would
but
the
assignment
of
the
company
were
not
because
we
obtained
assignments
for
the
next
of
kin.
you
see,
we
protect
our
self
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
but
if
i
didn't
get
definitely
so.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
wouldn't
be
--
wouldn't
--
my
assignment
wouldn't
be
effective.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
no.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
why?
because
certain
statute
says,
“if
he
doesn't
leave
a
will,
the
next
of
kin
get
it
automatically.”
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
but
i
still
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
right.
you
see,
if
he
made
a
will
then
we
should
get
it,
that's
correct,
because
the
executor
as
this
court
said
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
--
saves
us
to
the
shoes
of
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
unless
i
get
a
separate
assignment.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
of
course,
not.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
the
reason
i
got
it
from
the
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
the
assignment
for
the
next
of
kin,
correct.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
of
course
you
see
as
this
court
said
if
i
may
respectfully
say
so,
that
if
he
has
no
wife
and
child
he
has
a
power,
see,
to
designate
by
will,
the
executor
apply
for
the
renewal
which
of
course
would
be
for
the
purpose
affecting
the
author's
disposition
thereof.
that's
the
way
it
is
done.
if
it
intended,
if
the
statute
intended,
may
i
say,
that
it
should
only
be
applied
--
it
should
only
apply
for
beneficiaries
undergo
it
until
he
said
so.
instead
of
saying,
he
didn't
leave
a
will
or
to
have
to
save
us
if
i
might
respectfully
say
so,
if
--
if
there's
no
beneficiaries
this
is
--
it
is
not
disposed
at
the
beneficiaries.
that's
all
just
that
same
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
true
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
and
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
definitely.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
definitely.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
right.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
cutoff
badly,
sir?
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
no.
no,
i
said
--
well,
put
up
with
other
way,
if
you
don't
mind.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes.
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes
we
do
because
if
it
wasn't
for
the
will,
we
wouldn't
get
it
by
appointing
the
executor,
he
really
effectuates
the
disposition
to
us
through
the
executor.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
i
don't
know
if
he
did
or
didn't.
so,
he
didn't
make
a
specific
requirement.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
no.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes,
sir.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
if
there's
no
will,
that's
correct.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
yes,
sir.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
well,
i
--
the
court
could
leave
him.
i
just
didn't
want
to
take
that
technical
position,
you
know
i'm
--
because
the
other
proposition
to
save
so,
why
should
i
do
that.
i
--
i
feel
this
way,
i'm
absolutely
--
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
i
am.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
i
understand
that,
sir.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
that's
right,
sir.
if
you
don't
mind
my
saying.
mr.
julian
t.
abeles
thank
you
sir.
