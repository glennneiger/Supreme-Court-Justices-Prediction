mr.
milton
a.
rudin
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
court.
i
feel
somewhat
remiss
that
at
this
point
that
our
brief
perhaps
did
not
cover
to
a
greater
extent
the
statutory
history
of
section
24.
we
felt
to
a
great
extent,
this
had
been
set
forth
in
fisher
versus
witmark
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
noted
in
the
de
sylva-ballentine
decision
and
not
repeating
that
statutory
history
that
having
been
set
forth,
there
was
no
need
to
set
it
forth
again
and
even
in
de
sylva-ballentine.
i'd
like
to
advert
to
the
history
very
briefly
without
going
into
the
great
detail
which
this
court's
opinion
did
in
fisher-witmark
by
considering
briefly,
“what
is
the
nature
of
a
copyright?”
it
is
after
all
a
congressional
franchise.
it
is
the
statement
of
property
copyrighted.
congress
in
article
1
section
8
provided
for
the
protection
of
exclusive
period
of
monopolies
to
promote
the
arts
and
sciences.
to
a
great
extent,
we
adopted,
pointed
out
in
the
fisher-witmark
decision
without
detail,
the
statute
then
in
the
1790
statute.
we
had
a
14-year
term
with
a
right
to
the
author
his
executive's
administrator
or
assigns
to
renew
for
additional
14-year
period
if
a
contingency
occurred.
the
contingency
had
to
be
the
author's
survival.
there
is
no
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
the
author
had
to
survive.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
it's
my
recollection,
your
honor
of
the
1790
statute
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
the
statute
made
it
clear
that
he
had
to
survive.
there
was
a
condition
even
he's
at
--
while
he
could
assign
it,
there
were
certainly
no
limit
on
the
assignability.
but
still,
no,
they
are
only
by
contingency.
it
was
--
that
was
a
strange
situation
as
i
--
i
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
right.
and
i
believe
there
was
another
condition.
i
believe
he
also
had
to
be
a
resident
in
the
united
stated,
in
the
1790
statute.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
correct.
well,
he
may
not
have
even
retained
the
right.
he
may
have
assigned
it
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
14th
year
but
whoever
purchased
it
from
him
would
only
purchase
a
contingency
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
correct.
but
if
he
survived
and
i
believe
with
six
months
prior
to
that
date,
mr.
ellsworth's
report
which
is
the
reference
is
in
fisher-witmark
to
the
place
in
the
debates
or
the
house
reports.
report
before
the
1830
statute
recognized
that
there
should
be
further
protection
and
the
1830
statute
extended
the
protection
to
the
widow
and
children.
in
other
words,
if
the
author
would
not
living
at
the
expiration
of
that
particular
period
of
time,
then
the
widow
or
children
--
and
this
was
really
the
same
problem
that
came
about
in
the
18
--
the
subsequent
revisions.
the
concept
of
just
extending
the
protection
to
the
widow
and
children
without
getting
into
the
problem
and/or
which
this
court
has
heretofore
dealt
with
was
in
those
two
statutes.
going
beyond
the
widow
or
children
did
not
come
into
being
until
the
1909
act.
when
you
got
the
language
of
section
24
which
is
now
section
23
which
went
on
the
--
on
widow
and
children,
and
said
if
the
author,
if
there
be
no
author,
widow,
widower
or
children,
then
to
the
author's
executor
in
any
absence
of
a
will
to
his
next
of
kin
and
the
problem
relates
to
what
was
does
that
include,
the
author's
executor
and
next
of
kin.
it
was
a
renewal
copyright
and
again,
it
was
a
congressional
grant
for
a
second
period
and
they
are
called
depended
upon
certain
matters
happening,
registration
of
the
claim
in
the
--
during
the
28th
year.
there
were
differences
also
in
the
period
of
time,
the
1831
statute
had
it
for
28
years
and
14
years
for
the
renewal
period
and
1909
became
to
--
to
28-year
terms.
i
don't
think
there's
any
problem
and
there
should
not
be
any
problem
of
the
question
of
the
assignability
of
this
rights.
it
is
not
inherent
to
our
position
that
there'd
be
any
restraint
on
the
assignability
like
this
court
made
it
quite
clear
did
notwithstanding
what
some
people
have
interpreted
or
the
minority
view
in
which
to
have
as
this
court
concurred
in
at
that
time,
felt
that
there
should
be
an
absolute
restriction
against
assignment.
this
court
did
hold
that
these
rights
were
assignable
and
it
so
held
in
1943
and
if
it
had
perhaps
held
otherwise,
there
would
have
not
have
been
other
problems
but
it's
so
held
and
congress
has
not
changed
the
act
since
that
time.
and
so,
we
have
--
to
approach
this
problem
that
the
author's
right
is
assignable,
the
widow
and
children's
right
is
assignable.
i
believe
the
reference
to
be
executor
is
really
just
a
testamentary
power
of
appointment
to
the
author
which
is
assignable
but
which
was
not
assigned
in
this
case
and
the
next
of
kin
who
may
not
all
be
determined
have
a
certain
in
court
contingent
right
which
is
assignable.
and
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
correct,
but
it's
a
power
of
appointment
and
it
was
not
assigned
in
this
case
and
it
is
not
inherent
to
our
position
that
we
are
arguing
against
the
assignability
of
these
rights.
what
we
contend
here
is
what
has
been
assigned
and
that
is
the
issue
in
this
case
because
--
yes,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
correct.
the
executor
is
--
as
your
honor
pointed
out
before,
legal
title
exercising
it
for
the
benefit
of
those
designated,
the
legatees.
he
raised
several
questions
along
that
line.
he
raised
the
question
of
predators,
what
the
predators
would
take.
well,
if
the
author
exercise.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
think
--
i
think,
the
power
of
appointment,
i
think
it
is
subject
to
an
agreement.
it's
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
i
don't
believe
it's
an
issue
here.
but,
i
think
the
power
to
leave
a
will,
an
agreement
to
leave
a
will
should
be
assignable
under
federal
law,
under
the
copyright
law
based
on
fisher
versus
witmark.
if
i
am
to
examine
that
a
little
bit
further
at
this
point,
mr.
justice
brennan
which
i
would
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
not
the
complete
answer,
i
think.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
it
would
be
the
author
under
federal
law
but
i
think
you
then
have
to
refer
to
state
law
under
de
sylva-ballentine.
if
you
decide
and
follow
the
philosophy
of
fisher
versus
witmark
that
in
the
absence
of
an
express
restriction
against
assignability,
the
right
must
be
assignable.
under
federal
law,
we
must
then
look
to
state
law
to
determine
if
an
agreement
to
assign
or
an
agreement
to
bequeath
would
be
valid.
and
if
in
a
particular
case,
the
various
formalities
of
such
an
agreement
had
been
satisfied.
and
in
this
case,
interestingly
enough
mr.
justice
brennan,
even
if
we
were
to
go
that
far
because
this
is
the
thing
that
has
interested
us
several
times.
the
original
complaint
in
this
case,
transcript
of
record
reference
is
on
page
3,
paragraph
9.
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
was,
mr.
black
bequeathed
by
will
the
right
of
his
brother
david
black,
as
the
executor,
in
the
bank
of
america
to
apply
for
the
renewal
of
said
copyright,
and
said
musical
composition
for
on
be
--
for
and
on
behalf
of
plaintiff.
in
other
words,
the
plaintiff
in
this
action
started
out
on
the
theory
that
he
was
a
legatee,
that
he
was
a
beneficiary
under
the
will.
but
when
in
the
trial
court
confronted
with
the
fact
he
said
might
say
--
by
saying
that
you're
a
beneficiary,
you
should
have
come
in
the
san
francisco
probate
court
and
claimed
as
a
beneficiary.
you
should
have
asked
for
this
as
the
beneficiary
if
this
was
to
be
interpreted
as
an
agreement
to
label
well.
not
having
done
so,
the
decree
of
a
probate
court
distributing
this
testamentary
power,
this
property
right
acquired
by
virtue
of
the
exercise
of
the
testimony
power,
is
a
final
judgment,
it's
res
judicata
and
your
foreclosed.
then
he
said,
“then
when
we
find
the
argument
that
matters,”
he
said,
“no,
i'm
claiming
it
by
virtue
of
the
assignment
from
the
author,”
ais
assignment,
not
his
assignment
of
his
testamentary
power
of
appointment.
and
as
to
that,
we
say
that
assignment
you
got
it,
it
was
assignable
but
you
just
didn't
buy
anything
because
it
didn't
vest,
you
bought
a
contingency.
the
very
nature
of
section
24
in
the
absence
over
an
express
restriction
against
assignability
prior
to
the
vesting
of
the
rights
creates
contingencies.
this
was
the
argument
of
mr.
--
judge
frank
in
the
dissent
in
fisher
versus
witmark
in
the
lower
court.
he
said,
“if
you
don't
restrict
assignability
so
as
you're
going
to
get
to
gambling,
you're
going
to
have
contingencies.”
this
court
in
its
majority
opinion
was
not
impressed
with
that
argument.
it
said,
“if
congress
intended
no
assignability,
then
it
should
have
said
so.”
it
is
true,
the
value
goes
up.
if
one
were
to
write
a
book
which
a
motion
picture
company
wish
to
make
into
a
picture
and
the
book
had
been
out
one
year
and
had
remained
in
27
years
in
this
country
that's
beside
the
foreign
situation.
the
company
would
buy
figuring
27
years
is
enough
to
exploit
the
book.
if
the
book
is
15
years
old,
the
company
would
face
another
problem.
it'll
figure
what,
“i
can
get
the
picture
out
in
about
two
years,
that's
17
years,
and
least
me
about
11
years
and
i
may
want
to
exploit
up
to
20
years.”
if
the
man
doesn't
live,
i
may
not
have
anything.
true
of
--
mr.
--
mr.
abeles
has
been
many
years
more
at
the
bar
than
i
have
but
i
have
been
active
in
the
acquisition
of
acquiring
rights
and
active
in
the
selling
of
such
rights.
then
we
face
such
a
situation
in
lust
for
life
with
an
irving
stone
book
which
was
recently
a
few
years
ago
made
into
a
motion
picture,
mr.
abeles'
client.
they
came
to
us
and
purchased
the
rights
from
the
author.
they
purchased
to
what
rights
from
the
widow.
they
purchased
the
rights
from
the
children.
they
required
an
agreement
to
bequeath
by
will
to
them
if
there
were
no
wife
and
children,
the
additional
right.
they
didn't
go
to
the
next
of
kin
but
notwithstanding
all
of
that
in
negotiating
for
the
price
to
be
paid.
the
argument
was
made,
we're
buying
a
contingency.
if
i
may
say,
life
and
death
intervene
and
there's
another
thing
here
since
de
sylva-ballentine
in
this
court
which
we
have
to
admit
and
that
section
intervenes.
the
man
has
an
illegitimate
child,
what
they
thought
would
be
an
exclusive
grant
would
become
a
nonexclusive
grant.
and
if
the
wife
and
children
were
killed
in
a
common
disaster,
the
man
might
well
remarry
and
die
prior
to
the
28th
year
and
the
new
wife
would
take,
only,
didn't
acquire
from
the
next
of
kin
suppose
he
didn't
leave
a
will.
it
would
be
a
contingency,
i
think
they
would
become
general
predators
of
the
state
for
breach
of
contract
perhaps
if
the
contract
was
otherwise
enforceable
in
california
but
they
would
have
not
been
entitled
to
specific
performance
because
the
executor
or
administrator
took
nothing
in
such
an
event.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
writings.
yes.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
we're
not
dealing
--
in
--
in
reality,
if
congress
intends
that
renewal
periods
should
only
be
dealt
with
in
terms
of
vested
rights
that
you
can't
assign
futures.
well,
whatever
my
personal
views
may
have
been
as
to
what
would
be
the
best
face
in
approach
to
the
law,
fisher
versus
witmark
has
been
on
the
books
for
some
--
almost
17
years
now.
legislation
is
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
pending,
it
hasn't
been
changed.
but
we
have
to
deal
with
the
fact,
that
there
are
assignability
and
there
are
contingencies
but
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
(voice
overlap)
completely.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
a
street
case?
i
had
not
to
argue
the
case
that
you
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
right
and
not
to
argue
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
correct.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
absolutely
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
and
i
didn't
want
to
go
into
the
prior
case
that
was
argued
but
you
--
in
effect
you
have
this
additional
problem
whether
it's
a
vested
right.
congress
is
granting
a
renewal
period.
now,
suppose
congress
takes
it
away
two
years
before
it
vest,
is
there
anything
that
the
man
signs
a
contract
that
he
has
a
--
an
agreement
from
congress,
they
are
not
going
to
change
the
renewal
principles
or
in
effect
change
it?
there
has
been
considerable
agitation
on
the
copyright
part
to
adopt
the
european
system
now,
extending
one
term
of
copyright
for
life
plus
50
years
or
some
definitive
terms
if
they
don't
have
to
become
concerned
about
the
renewal
period
but
that's
a
matter
for
congress
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
renewal
period.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
no.i
do
not
believe
so
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
your
honor.
i
think,
you
cannot
got
--
get
much
help.
certainly,
the
appellant
didn't
get
much
help
from
the
congressional
report
from
your
honors
opinion,
you
--
he
invoked
it
very
heavily
but
your
honor
rejected
the
invocation
in
the
fisher-witmark
decision
of
saying,
the
intent
was
to
make
it
not
assignable,
the
benefit
the
widow
of.
but
--
well,
the
only
help
we
could
get
perhaps
this
one
line,
it
says,
it
was
not
the
same
report
in
connection
with
the
1909
act.
it
was
not
the
intent
--
it
was
not
the
intent
to
permit
the
administrator
to
apply
for
the
renewal
but
to
permit
the
author
who
had
no
wife
or
children
to
bequeath
by
will
the
right
to
apply
for
the
renewal.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
then
living,
yes.
but
they
also
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
and
also
the
executors,
administrators
or
assigns
phrase
as
--
as
a
total
phrase.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
correct.
if
he
had
died,
there
would
have
been
no
right
in
anyone.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
and
we've
not
--
we'll
not
be
here
at
all.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
but
extended
it
only
to
--
as
far
as
the
widow
or
children.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
correct.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
no
question
about
that
and
we
say
that
those
in
whose
favor
the
author
exercised
his
testamentary
power
of
appointment
on
the
third
step
of
the
copyright,
1909
act,
are
not
--
their
rights
are
not
defeated
by
a
prior
assignment
of
the
right
which
never
vested.
mr.
milton

rudin
unless
he
divorced
her.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
unless
he
divorced
her.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
right
and
the
children.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
right.
what
the
consequences
of
including
the
phrase
and
if
there
be
no
author,
widow,
widower
or
children
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
then
to
the
author's
executor
and
i
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
in
prior
to
1909
i
--
i
--
really
don't
think
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
any
statute.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
--
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
think,
we
can
only
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
you
might
get
some
help
from
the
referral
back
to
the
1790
statute.
i
believe
that
would
be
strange
a
little
bit
to
say,
there,
they
used
the
executors,
administrator
assigns,
and
here,
they
just
said
executor.
i
think
the
fact
of
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
almost
drawing
that
concession
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
that
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
they
cut
that
out
but
here,
your
honor,
they
said
the
executor
and
they
deliberately
omitted
the
administrator.
now,
why
did
they
say
the
executor
and
deliberately
omit
the
administrator.
perhaps
they
did
not
intend
that
it
become
just
another
asset
of
his
estate.
why
the
distinction
between
an
executor
and
administrator
if
it
was
not
to
have
some
significance?
and
why
the
one
sentence
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
believe
so,
that's
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
that's
whatever
help
i
could
get
from
the
congressional
intent.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
decided
that
and
i
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
i
see
no
need
to
reargue
it.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
nor
do
i
think
we
need
it
for
the
position
here.
we
might
put
it
--
in
other
words,
i'd
like
to
clear
it
up
for
an
opening,
mr.
abeles
made
a
statement
that
would
seem
to
shock
me
when
he
quoted
mr.
ladas
and
mr.
ball
as
to
what
they
said
were
the
law
applicable
of
what
we
are
relying
on
that
this
was
not
a
right
that
is
assignable
at
all.
nothing
could
be
further
from
what
the
volume
says.
mr.
ladas
in
harvard
studies
of
international
law
points
out
in
referring
the
renewal
rights
says,
“it
will
be
noted
that
the
incoherent
rights
of
these
persons
are
personal
and
cannot
be
assigned.”
but
he
goes
on
to
explain
what
he
meant
by
that.
he
says,
“an
assignee
cannot
obtain
a
renewal
copyright
merely
in
his
capacity
as
assignee.”
he
was
talking
about
his
function
in
filing
the
application.
that
was
his
view
at
that
time.
nor
can
an
administrator
take
out
a
renewal
copyright
for
the
general
benefit
of
the
author's
estate.
if
the
author
has
made
a
contract
for
the
assignment
of
the
right
to
obtain
original
copyright,
and
of
the
right
to
renew
the
same,
he
maybe
compelled
to
carryout
his
undertaking
by
himself
applying
for
renewal
of
the
copyright
and
assigning
it
to
the
other
party
to
the
contract.
in
other
words,
mr.
ladas
was
not
talking
about
the
general
contract
law
your
honor,
questioned
about
assignability
but
he
was
specifically
referring
to
the
mechanical
exercise
of
the
rights.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
i'm
sure
mr.
--
i
--
i
think,
i
must
also
come
to
mr.
ball's
defense
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
since
we
cited
him.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
no.
i
--
i'd
like
find
it
before
i
can
re-quote
it.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
it
says,
“if
the
author
survives
the
first
27
years
of
the
original
term,
a
prior
assignment
of
his
expectancy
is
valid
and
enforceable
but
if
he
dies
before
the
28th
year
of
the
first
term,
the
right
to
renew
passes
to
his
beneficiaries
in
the
order
on
which
they
are
mentioned
in
section
23
of
the
act,
thus
invalidating
any
previous
--
previous
assignment
of
his
expectancy.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
he
went
on
to
what
reasons
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
were
argued
but
points
out
that
this
court
sort
of
rejected
those
reasons
in
fisher
versus
witmark.
there
was
this
concept
in
thought.
there
were
--
there
were
two
misconceptions
about
section
24
before
this
court
ruled
and
there
have
been
three
cases
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
i'm
confessed
with
the
fact
that
if
the
present
members
of
the
court
who
voted
in
that
case
with
vote
we
might
find
that
were
reversed,
your
honor.
[laughs]
but
in
that
if
there
were
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
[laughs]
but
if
they
were
the
same
mind
then
perhaps
over
the
time
--
the
point
is
the
case
has
been
decided,
i
think
this
is
very
persuasive.
fisher
versus
witmark
was
decided
17
years
ago,
if
this
court
misconstrued
the
congressional
intent
as
to
assignability,
congress
has
had
17
years
to
correct
that
misconstruction.
it
has
failed
to
do
so
to
this
date.
and
so
aside
from
any
question
of
re-argument
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
no.
it
would
not.
[laughter]
i
think
we'd
have
great
difficulty
even
getting
some
basic
consideration.
that
has
perhaps
been
the
trouble
but
i
think
the
point
made
by
mr.
--
mr.
judge
frank
and
adopted
by
the
dissent
is
quite
true
that
any
absence
of
a
restriction
against
assignability,
you've
got
gambles
in
the
copyright
law
and
he
made
quite
a
fuzz
about
that
in
his
minority
views
are
--
remember
his
--
this
shouldn't
be
a
gambling
matter.
well,
there
are
many
gambles
in
life,
life
insurance
is
a
gamble
in
--
in
many
ways
in
which
you
place
a
bet
and
hope
that
your
opponent
will
win
his
bet.
in
this
case,
you
place
a
bet
and
you
hope
that
you
will
win,
you
hope
to
acquire
certain
rights
if
you
buy
them
in
futural
aside
from
the
gamble
of
whether
the
styles
were
changed
or
whether
you're
really
interested
in
exercising
the
right
you'll
acquire
but
i
think
the
situation
is
this
in
mr.
abeles'
case.
he
gambled,
there
were
four
outstanding
rights
that
congress
created
which
he
could
purchase.
there
were
tickets
one,
two,
three
and
four,
he
bought
a
ticket
on
number
one,
the
author's
right
if
he
lived
until
the
28th
year.
i'm
sorry,
that
offer
did
not
make
it
so
that
ticket
paid
him
nothing.
he
couldn't
buy
a
ticket
at
number
two
at
that
time
because
the
man
had
no
wife
or
children
that
he
knew
of.
he
felts
quite
confident
that
the
man
had
bought
a
wife
and
his
wife
could
be
purchased
for
the
same
$1000
and
get
an
assignment.
didn't
think
there'd
be
any
problem
by
just
confidence
in
the
pliability
of
new
wives
is
great,
but
nevertheless,
he
would
have
had
to
purchase
something
but
he
didn't
buy
it.
but
that
never
came
into
being
but
he
did
not
buy
number
three
and
that
is
the
testamentary
power
of
appointment
which
he
did
not
put
in
the
will.
he
--
he
intimated
that
the
will
should
be
so
interpreted
or
his
assignment
should
be
so
interpreted.
i
submit
clear
language
of
the
assigment
does
not
give
him
that
comfort
and
even
if
it
did,
he
would
run
into
the
california
problem
that
--
as
a
legatee.
there
is
a
claim
legatee's
foreclosed
because
he
has
never
made
his
claim,
and
there's
enough
claim.
he's
never
come
in
and
there's
been
a
decree
of
distribution.
the
fourth,
take
it
to
the
next
of
kin,
he
bought
but
that
one
lost
too
because
the
author
left
a
will.
he
could
have
perhaps
bought
all
four
tickets
and
still
have
lost.
and
this
is
--
this
is
the
--
the
interesting
problem.
suppose
mr.
black
had
bought
all
three
tickets,
suppose
he
had
contracted
with
mr.
black
to
leave
a
will
designating
miller
music
as
the
beneficiary
of
the
exercise
of
this
right.
could
miller
music
required
mr.
black
to
agree
not
to
marry
and
not
to
bear
children
until
the
vesting
of
renewal
right
until
the
28th
year?
it
seem
to
me
that
might
be
a
contract
against
the
public
interest.
there
is
just
no
way
as
long
as
you
can
assign
prior
to
the
vesting
of
the
right
and
the
vesting
of
the
right
depends
upon
certain
conditions.
there
is
no
way
to
control
those
conditions
because
they
deal
with
human
elements
and
therefore,
there
is
no
positive
acquisition
of
a
right
when
you
buy
it
prior
to
the
28th
year.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
no.
i
don't
concede
that
it
did
end
all
rights
to
renewal.
it
left
the
author
with
a
power
of
appointment
to
be
exercised
by
his
will.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
don't
really
think,
i
think
the
executor
was
the
vehicle,
was
the
man
that
held
legal
title.
i
think
it
was
the
legatees
under
the
will.
i
think
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
that's
what
the
(inaudible)
case
held.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
do.
it
extinguished
all
rights
of
renewal
that
the
author
had.
it
extinguished
it
on
step
one
to
the
author
if
he'd
be
living.
it
did
not
extinguish
the
widow's
rights
until
there
were
no
widow
or
children.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
but
it
says
if
he'd
be
living
at
the
first
sentence.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
in
the
first
sentence
of
the
act,
your
honor,
the
statute,
it
says
if
he'd
be
living.
of
course,
step
one
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
and
i'm
--
so
i
feel
that
that's
the
rhythm
of
it
and
not
an
interpretation.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
don't
see
how
i
could
if
he
couldn't
very
well
have
an
executor
and
still
be
living.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
what
--
but
what
if
he
make
a
disposition,
that
was
the
question.
i
feel
that
goes
back
to
the
basic
question.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
but
the
statute
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
it
deals
with
a
term
beyond
his
living
and
it
imposes
another
condition
upon
the
author
that
he
leave
a
will,
it
gives
him
another
right.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
he
may
have
disliked
his
next
of
kin
tremendously
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--if
he
didn't
leave
a
will,
they
would
get
it,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
then
his
next
of
kin
would
get
it
whether
he
liked
it
or
not.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
correct.
i
submit
the
testimony
of
power
of
appointment,
the
right
to
leave
a
will
to
stop
his
next
of
kin
from
getting
it.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
think,
perhaps
so,
your
honor.
but
and
may
i
respectfully
submit
two
points
in
answer
to
that.
and
that
is,
one,
that
if
this
right
was
assignable,
this
power,
did
the
present
instrument
accomplish
that
at
all
(inaudible)
required
by
contract
to
agree
that
he
will
leave
a
will,
naming
an
executor
authorize
the
executor,
renew
the
copyright
and
transfer
it
to
his
assignee.
he
agrees
to
bequeath
and
it's
a
separate
assignable
right.
he
agrees
to
transfer
his
right
if
he
lives
and
he
agrees
to
bequeath
if
he
dies.
and
the
second
answer
to
that
if
i
may
respectfully
submit,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
that
in
this
case,
we
only
mentioned
the
point
because
under
the
theory
of
the
district
court,
he
rejected
our
california
argument
as
i
--
i
call
it.
his
--
he
said,
“the
author's
death
prior
to
the
28th
year
met
the
--
the
assignment
in
this
case
conveyed
nothing
because
the
author
died
and
that
the
people
who
are
the
legatees
therefore,
get
the
right
that
the
executor
had,
are
not
bound
by
that
prior
assignment.”
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
no.
i
did
not
--
i
did
not
submit
specific
performance
in
my
statement.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
i'd
like
to
answer
that
in
three
steps.
yes,
under
the
copyright
law
that
it
would
be
possible,
two,
you'd
have
to
refer
to
the
state
law
to
see
if
the
state
law
will
permit
it.
i
submit,
under
the
authority
of
de
sylva-ballentine
that
once
you
have
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that
question
isn't
here
though,
your
honor.
that's
the
point.
moreover
even
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
if
--
if
under
particular
state
law
he
was
able
to
buy
the
right
to
--
to
inherit
by
will,
if
he
was
--
i
could
go
to
a
man
and
say,
“i
will
give
you”
and
it's
done.
let's
give
the
typical
example
of
some
of
these
annuity
policies
or
all
the
folk
songs,
where
they
go
to
someone
who
say,
“you
turn
over
all
of
your
assets
or
you
give
us
$10,000
or
if
we
renamed
as
his
beneficiary
of
your
--
of
black
then
--
then
we
will
support
you
for
the
rest
of
your
life.”
it's
an
agreement
to
live
a
will.
the
california
law,
if
certain
formalities
are
observed,
it
is
a
proper
agreement.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
your
honor,
perhaps
so
and
perhaps
it
should
be
a
matter
of
state
law
--
a
--
a
federal
law
that
is
not
assignable.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
it
might
be
the
next
case
this
court
would
have
to
decide
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
it's
not
present
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
some
all
force
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
in
the
fisher
case,
this
court
simply
held
that
there
was
no
restriction
on
the
assignability
of
the
future
contingent
right
that
a
man
could
assign
his
renewal
right
prior
to
the
time
that
vested.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
but
the
fisher
case
went
on
to
recognize
that
if
he
died
prior
to
the
right
vesting,
the
assignee
took
exactly
nothing
because
the
right
didn't
vest.
that's
as
far
as
the
fisher
case
went.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
the
fisher
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
no.
i
don't
think
--
yes,
it
would
--
it
would
be
but
i'm
afraid
it
was
the
--
i
believe
my
recollection
was
the
--
the
dictum
but
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
take
it
back.
your
honor
showed
greater
care
of
than
the
court
of
appeals.
there
was
the
argument
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
i
apologize.
[laughter]
the
brief
--
the
brief
did
argue
--
the
brief
of
the
respondent
did
argue.
of
course,
if
the
author
assigns
the
renewal
term
but
does
not
survive,
the
assignee's
whose
rights
cannot
be
greater
than
the
author's
will
take
nothing.
that
statement
also
appeared
in
the
court
of
appeals
decisions,
my
apologies,
did
not
appear
in
your
opinions,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
assumed
it
was
--
it
--
it
has
been
so
often
quoted
as
having
appeared
in
that
opinion
that
i
was
almost
made
to
believe.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
but
--
but
be
that
as
it
may,
the
fisher-witmark
case
did
assign
that
it
was
--
i
feel
cited
only
one
question
that
it
could
be
assigned
prior
to
its
vesting.
and
that
was
the
only
(voice

fisher-witmark
case.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
if
he
has
a
--
if
he
has
a
wife
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
he
would
have
to
get
it
from
the
wife
because
if
the
wife
would
then
get
it,
wife
or
children.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
not
in
then
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
not
--
not
in
then,
the
wife
and
children
in
the
same
class.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
for
the
last
few
years
my
--
i
--
i
must
have
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
hope
it
to
remain
the
same.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
only
if
he
fails
to
leave
a
will.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
then
the
next
of
kin
would
take
it.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
no,
it
would
not
be.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
no.
and
i
think,
the
petitioner
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
is
here
to
concede
that
he
says
he
protected
himself
by
getting
an
assignment
from
the
next
of
kin.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
no.
it's
not
here.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
for
--
for
me
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
no.
i
don't
think
there's
any
difference.
i
think
that
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
believe
the
executor
represents
the
first
of
the
beneficiaries
in
this
case
and
not
the
person
of
the
testator.
that's
the
difference.
i
think
if
i
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
said
in
question,
the
executor
is
a
legal
institution,
he
must
represent
something.
you
can
only
get
what
the
decedent
had.
and
i
differ
in
that
respect
to
some
extent,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
because
--
let's
take
a
common
situation
of
a
power
of
appointment
in
the
will
where
a
man
is
given
the
life
interest
but
no
right
to
invade
the
corpus.
but
it
is
provided
that
he
may
on
his
death,
by
will,
executed
the
due
formalities
of
the
state
in
which
he
lives,
exercise
a
power
of
appointment
to
distribute
the
corpus
of
the
trust
and
direct
his
executor
to
do
so
or
should
go
to
his
executor
for
that
purpose.
or
he
might
under
some
constructions
and
under
some
trust
even
exercise
it
to
become
part
of
the
general
assets
of
his
--
his
estate.
it's
a
very
common
thing
these
days.
we've
had
with
men
who
put
their
assets
in
the
hands
of
a
bank,
say
even
in
a
irrevocable
inter
vivos
trust
to
provide
for
a
power
of
appointment
he
exercised
by
will
and
he
exercise
that
power
of
appointment
in
favor
of
their
executors
for
the
purposes
set
forth
in
the
will.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
might
be
(voice
overlap)
purposes.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
i
believe
they
do,
they
must.
they
draw
a
distinction
between
the
right
of
the
next
of
kin
and
the
right
of
widow
or
children
and
the
executor.
they
say,
that
they
recognize
that
if
the
author's
inter
vivos
assignment,
the
author's
assignment
tenure's
life
prior
to
the
28th
year,
and
if
he
dies
prior
to
the
28th
year,
does
not
defeat
the
rights
of
the
widow,
widower
or
children
but
defeats
the
--
or
the
next
of
kin.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
or
the
next
of
kin.
we
concede
that.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
correct.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes,
because
here
in
this
particular
case,
they
had
an
assignment
in
the
next
of
kin
and
they
are
not
asserting
their
rights
under
that
assignment.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
in
my
view
in
--
in
what
under
the
facts
stated
by,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
right.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
steps
three
came
in
beforehand,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
believe
that
there's
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
don't
--
it
might
have
made
a
difference
but
not
as
a
matter
of
copyright
law.
it
would've
made
a
difference
based
on
the
instrument,
the
matter
of
general
law
interpreting
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
the
instrument.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
but
under
this
law,
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
but
they
wouldn't
take
his
next
of
kin.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
the
point.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
i
--
because
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
because
congress
could've
well
said
that
in
the
absence
of
a
will,
it
should
go
to
the
library
of
congress
for
the
benefit
of
buying
books
or
general
fund
or
for
charity.
instead,
congress
passed
it
on
to
the
next
of
kin
only,
but
only
in
the
event.
the
author
did
not
exercise
his
testamentary
power.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
believe
they
passed
it
to
the
executor
in
his
capacity,
his
illegal
institution
not
beneficially.
i
agree
that
he
did
not
get
it
beneficially.
in
his
capacity
as
a
legal
institution
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
put
it
but
not
as
legal
institution
representing
in
this
case,
the
person
of
his
testator
but
as
a
legal
institution
representing
the
rights
of
the
legatees
under
the
will.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
correct.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
it's
a
right.
my
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
they
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
name
an
executor
and
under
the
(inaudible)
case
to
designate
who
shall
receive
the
benefits
of
that.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
right.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
let
me
--
let
me
illustrate
it
directly
with
copyright
law,
mr.
justice
whitaker.
let
us
assume
in
this
case,
“moonlight
and
roses”,
the
man
or
any
copyright.
the
man
has
no
widow
or
children
and
the
copyright
is
in
its
10th
year
of
the
original
term
and
he
owns
the
copyright,
he's
publishing
it
himself.
he
leaves
to
his
executor
the
remaining
18
years
of
the
original
term.
he
lives
it
to
his
executor,
the
same
manner
that
he
could
have
assigned
it
to
him.
and
the
executor
takes
that
right
in
the
same
manner
that
he
might
also
take
black
acre
or
100
shares
of
general
motors
at
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
any
asset.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
right.
but
the
asset
involved
here
is
not
one
that
the
man
owned.
it's
a
privilege
extended
by
congress.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
i
at
least
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
correct.
i
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
if
congress,
if
you
look
at
the
purpose,
if
--
if
you
have
the
widow
and
children
first,
why
did
the
congress
say,
executor
and
not
at
--
to
his
estate
or
not
to
his
executor's
administrators
or
assigns
if
they
intended
that
the
third
class
as
i
put
it,
was
of
the
same
nature
of
the
first
class
that
the
only
thing
that
stopped
it
from
merging
together
was
the
second
class,
the
widow
or
children.
i
submit
--
i
admit
the
court
has
to
decide
it,
that's
why
we're
here
but
i
respectfully
urge
upon
the
court
that
the
construction
must
be
that
because
of
the
intervening
class
and
because
of
the
schedule
of
rights.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
respectfully
submit
that
is
the
position.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
congress
gave
him
two
rights
in
section
24.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
not
quite
what
i've
said,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
thought
--
i
would
like
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
said,
one
and
two
would
shed
light
if
three
is
a
different
animal
than
one.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
(voice
overlap)
the
three
is
a
different
animal.
the
three
--
three
is
a
power,
one
is
a
--
is
a
grant
of
the
direct
right
and
i
urged
and
i
feel
that
it
is
not
before
this
court
to
decide
whether
he
may
convey
one
and
three.
there
are
two
rights
given
to
the
author
and
step
one,
to
take
the
copyright
himself
if
he
survives
the
28th
year
and
step
three,
that
if
he
doesn't
survive,
it
doesn't
have
a
widow
of
children
to
intervene,
that
bequeath
by
will.
i
submit
that
both
rights
under
the
logic
of
fisher
versus
witmark,
if
one
right
is
assignable,
perhaps
the
other
should
be
assignable
but
the
court
need
not
decide
that
in
this
case.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
but
right,
we
submit
that
rights
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
no.
[laughs]
i
appreciate
that
but
i
submit
your
honor
that
right
one
and
three
being
different.
and
the
court,
i
submit
looks
to
the
instrument
under
which
the
appellant
claims
here
and
he
sees
that
he
acquires
only
right
one
that
he
did
not
bargain
for
nor
obtain
right
three.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
he
could.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
say
he
did
not
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
do
it
under
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
--
if
i
would
agree
to
that,
i
might
be
deciding
the
fifth
case
that
has
to
come
before
this
court
because
it's
not
before
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
he
hasn't
done
it
and
i
don't
feel
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
situation
i
feel
that
fisher,
if
you're
asking
my
opinion
as
a
lawyer,
i
would
like
to
answer
it
and
not
avoid
your
honor's
question.
i
feel
under
the
thrust
of
fisher
versus
witmark,
one
must
say
that
that
right
is
also
assignable.
i
think
correctly
or
incorrectly,
the
copyright
bar
had
been
working
upon
that
assumption
in
carrying
fisher
versus
witmark
further.
now,
whether
they
are
correct
and
not
as
fort
this
court
to
say
and
not
for
counsel
here
to
say
of
what
--
what
you
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
the
counsel
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that
phrase
frightens
me
somewhat
having
been
counsel
of
hammerstein
versus
superior
court
shortly
after
leaving
law
school.
i
--
i
don't
think
the
--
the
writ
in
improvably
granted
here,
it
is
a
federal
question,
the
--
not
a
jurisdictional
problem
but
perhaps
this
court
should
not
have
granted
hearing
in
this
case,
yes.
i
think,
it's
just
a
question
of
interpretation
of
contract.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i'm
sorry
but
the
question
was
put,
i
have
to
get
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
well,
but
i
have
to
answer
that
(voice
overlap)
quite
frankly,
your
honor
and
i
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
wanted
by
the
statement.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
i
might
give
you
about
20
different
ambiguities
in
section
24
but
not
on
before
the
court
at
this
time
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
but
i
think
that
it's
all
ambiguous
here.
i
think
it
is
not
ambiguous,
i
think
it
setup
four
classes
of
rights
for
this
question
in
this
case.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
--
the
columns
that
i
as
practitioner
have
to
face
in
interpreting
section
24,
i
would
love
to
have
this
court's
advisory
capacity.
so
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
i
can
safely
advise
my
client.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
as
related
from
the
question
here
whether
you
--
whether
i
am
to
interpret
that
statement
as
you'll
agree
with
me,
[laugher]
direct
me
in
the
dark.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
i
do
your
honor.
i
believe
then
that
we
come
up
to
a
question
which
should
--
should
really
not
be
before
this
court
but
which
we've
cited
authorities
below
that
the
appellant
would
be
bound
by
the
judgment
of
the
superior
court
in
california
which
distributed
the
right
which
the
executor
exercise.
this
copyright
was
renewed
by
the
executor,
went
into
the
estate.
if
you
interpret
the
instrument
as
an
agreement
to
leave
a
will
then
it
becomes
a
question
of
state
law
whether
it
complied
with
those
aspects
of
it
and
then
under
state
law
becomes
a
further
question
if
he
is
not
bound
by
the
decree
of
distribution
distributing
it
for
the
nieces
and
nephews.
see,
what
happened
here
was,
they
got
it
from
three
brothers
and
the
man
quite
naturally
having
brothers
have
the
same
ages
as
he
was,
made
a
general
request,
some
specific
request
and
left
everything
to
his
nieces
and
nephews,
those
are
nephew
--
nieces
and
nephews
that
took
the
right
that
was
exercised
by
the
executor.
but
we
do
get
a
question
of
state
law
if
you
want
to
interpret
the
instrument
but
it
has
not
been
urged.
he
started
out
urging
that
but
when
faced
in
the
lower
court
unless
the
res
judicata
question
departed
from
that
and
has
rested
this
case.
i
submit
solely,
on
the
assignment
of
the
author
which
is
step
one
in
which
assignment
i
say
never
vested
that
right,
never
vested
because
the
man
died
before
the
28th
year.
then
the
widow,
child
--
the
children
came
in
since
their
being
not
--
we
went
to
the
third
step,
the
author's
executor
and
as
i
hoped
that
i
have
now
made
clear
and
i
apologize
if
i
did
not
make
it
clear
before.
we're
not
arguing
that
the
author
during
his
lifetime
could
not
assign
that
right
but
we
say,
the
court
doesn't
reach
that
question
because
he
didn't
assign
it.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
do
not
so
understand
the
witmark
case.
i
understand
the
witmark
case
is
deciding
the
facts
in
that
case
to
with
that
the
man
survived
the
28th
year
and
that
his
assignment
prior
to
that
date
was
binding
upon
him.
and
the
witmark
case
and
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
to
that
regard
here,
go
one
step
further
with
the
witmark
case
though,
i
will
confess
the
commentators
have.
and
it
has
been
quoted
to
the
proposition
that
you
have
given
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
i
can't
say,
wit
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
your
honor,
can
i
give
you
this?
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
i'm
aware
of
that
your
honor
but
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
i
don't
think
the
witmark
case
went
so
far
because
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this.
let's
say
you
own
black
acre,
you
have
different
incidents
of
an
ownership
of
property.
let's
say
i
don't
own
black
acre
but
i
have
an
easement
over
black
acre
for
certain
purposes
and
let's
say
with
respect
to
a
scream
on
black
acre,
i
have
certain
riparian
rights
or
different
type
of
easement.
so,
let's
just
make
it
simple
two
different
types
of
easement,
two
different
types
rights,
i
could
well
leave
a
will,
leave
the
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
no.
but
the
rights
i'm
trying
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
but
this
statute
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i'll
answer
it
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
may
i
attempt
to
answer
this
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
mr.
justice
black,
may
i
answer
it
this
way.
that
fisher
versus
witmark
dealt
with
the
right
given
by
congress
to
the
author
to
renew
the
copyright
if
he
survived
the
28th
year.
this
case
deals
with
the
right
given
by
congress
to
an
author
who
does
not
survive
the
28th
year
and
who
does
not
live
surviving
him
a
wife,
widower
or
children
or
child
to
bequeath
by
will.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
now,
fisher
versus
witmark
said
that
the
right
he
acquired
if
he
lived
was
assignable
prior
to
that
vesting.
and
i
simply
say
that
if
the
court
feels
it
necessary
to
decide
in
this
case
that
that
right
is
also
assignable
here,
it
can
do
so
without
affecting
the
decision
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
the
decision
in
the
case
because
there
was
no
assignment
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
of
that
right.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
correct.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
it
there
is
assignment
of
that
right
to
bequeath.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
if
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
but
if
--
if
the
question,
what
is
--
does
the
author's
prior
assignment
defeat
the
rights
of
the
widow,
widower
or
does
it
defeat
the
rights
of
the
executor?
my
answer
is
no.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
--
i
respectfully
submit
on
some
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well,
certainly
we
did
but
we
don't
think
we
have
to
defend
it
because
he
hasn't
raised
it.
it's
brought
in
here
on
the
sole
issue
we
believe
as
to
whether
the
assignment
of
the
right
in
step
one
as
i
call
it,
defeated
the
exercise
of
the
rights
under
step
three.
and
we
say
that
that's
--
there
are
no
different
classes,
they're
all
the
same
right.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
i
don't
want
to
make
my
task
any
harder
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
than
it
is,
your
honor.
[laughs]i
believe
that,
that's
it.
i'd
like
to
briefly
refer
to
fox
versus
knowles
which
was
cited
for
a
proposition,
i
didn't
understand
to
hold.
it
very
simply
held
that
the
executor
has
the
rights
and
renew
which
is
independent
of
the
author's
right.
it's
--
it's
of
significance
here
prior
to
the
fox
case.
there
seem
to
be
the
thought
that
the
executor
was
in
the
statute
only
exercise
the
right
of
renewal
if
the
author
made
it
into
the
28th
year
but
he
didn't
exercise
the
right
during
the
28th
year.
and
therefore,
the
executor
had
a
limited
function
in
the
statute.
in
fox
case
held
otherwise
and
said
that
it
was
a
separate
and
independent
right.
referring
to
what
is
exercising
the
same
right
of
the
decedent,
it
didn't
mean
the
same
grant
of
right
under
step
one,
the
same
type
of
right.
just
as
this
court
has
said
that
the
widow
and
children
exercise
the
same
right
that
the
author
have
if
he
dies
(inaudible)
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
that's
right.
if
something
survived
to
the
author
in
a
way
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
he
could
exercise
it
prior
to
his
death,
the
power
of
appointment.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
yes.
that's
a
true
statement
of
general
law.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
it
would
apply
to
copyrights
if
that
was
the
type
of
contract
involved
here,
your
honor,
but
it
was
not.
if
he
had
made
a
contract
about
the
balance
of
the
original
term
and
the
executor
took
it
in
the
same
manner
he
took
black
acre,
the
executor
would
be
bound
by
it.
but
what
he
had,
what
the
author
had
was
a
power
of
appointment
and
our
basic
position
is
that
the
petitioner
here
by
the
bargain
for
nor
obtained
the
--
that
right
but
he
--
that
his
assignment
doesn't
carry
with
it,
he
didn't
bargain
for
it
when
he
obtained
--
obtained
it.
he
might
have
gotten
it
but
perhaps
if
he
appointed
out
for
the
man,
he
might
have
given
him
more
than
$1000
but
he
didn't
buy
that
right.
and
it's
a
separate
and
independent
right,
this
is
a
case
where
an
executor
exercises
the
power
of
appointment
and
it's
not
the
question
of
a
divulsion
of
property
that
the
man
own.
this
is
after
all
a
franchise,
a
grant
by
congress
which
comes
into
being
after
the
man
dies
and
that's
our
position.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
that's
correct.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
it's
a
very
short
statement
of
it,
yes.i
--
i
believe
that
sir.
it's
fair
because
--
and
i
think
the
proof
of
that
is
in
the
(inaudible)
case
proof
of
support
of
our
position.
in
the
(inaudible)
case
was,
a
man
did
not
name
an
executor
or
just
said,
“you
should
go
to
my
hometown
at
the
carry.”
the
court
said
he
left
a
will
and
that's
the
intention
that
goes
to
the
carry
and
the
administrator
would
--
will
attach,
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
apply
that
thing
and
turn
it
over
to
his
town
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
well
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
my
time
is
up
and
i
would
love
to
say
further
except
i
might
just
briefly
say
an
executor
does
have
rights
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act
to
cause
of
action.
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
--
he
doesn't
say
that
all.
i
know
nothing
in
a
--
mr.
milton
a.
rudin
until
now
you
repeated
again
at
the
end
perhaps
--
