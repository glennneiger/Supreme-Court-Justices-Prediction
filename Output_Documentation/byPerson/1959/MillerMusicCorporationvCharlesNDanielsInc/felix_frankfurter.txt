justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
i'm
not
familiar
with
ball
with
that
--
of
what
you
read,
was
that
a
generalized
statement
by
that
author?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
assigned
property
that
you
haven't
got
in
--
in
essence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
does
the
author
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
derive
this
statement
as
a
general
proposition
of
--
of
conveyable
or
assignable
interest
or
that
he
derived
that
from
the
copyright
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
so
as
the
generality.
demonstrably
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
generality.
it
might
be
good
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
copyright,
but
not
as
--
as
the
property
generally?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
why
--
that's
why
you're
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
to
general
proposition
if
certainty
calls.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
has
been
no
decision
on
this
particular
question
as
i
understood?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
this
case
at
least
as
i
understand
the
problems
of
it,
cannot
be
decided
by
general
problems
of
property
law
and
certainly
not
by
wrong
propositions
of
property
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
to
be
decided.
i
don't
mean
to
say
general
considerations
of
--
of
laws'
attitude
towards
interest,
but
i
was
surprised
and
i
know
no
more
than
what
you
read.
i
was
surprised
that
any
author
would
say,
“you
got
to
have
property
ownership
or
property
in
essay
in
order
to
be
able
to
deal
with
it.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
certainly
is
a
matter
of
wrong
statement
that
one
could
find
in
the
ball.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
interrupt
you
another?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
ladas,
who's
writing
that,
do
happen
to
know,
what
does
he
say
about
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
admit,
he
says
the
author.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here,
his
talks
about
an
author
disposing
of
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
very
different
thing
from
the
same
defense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can't
deal
with
property
that
may
come
into
your
possession,
but
you
haven't
got
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
just
silly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
no,
it's
the
way
of
the
author,
that's
i
--
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
the
way
of
the
author.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
if
you
--
if
what
you
said
was
an
easy
answer
practically
and
the
chief
justice
asked
you,
well,
that
was
a
legal
answer,
the
assumption
is
if
you
--
if
what
you
regard
is
easy
doesn't
happen
in
a
particular
case,
the
wife
cannot
be
deprived
of
her
rights
under
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
your
point
that
widow
and
children
express
human
terms.
a
widow
is
a
widow
and
a
child
is
a
child,
but
an
executor
is
a
legal
institution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
an
executor,
by
virtue
of
being
an
executor,
isn't
a
--
a
human
institution,
but
a
legal
institution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
an
executor
can
only
guess
what
testator
left
him
to
get.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
if
the
testator,
according
to
your
view,
has
disposed
of
it,
it
couldn't
go
to
the
executor
because
it's
no
longer
in
the
estate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
widow
is
a
widow
by
designation
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
she
would
get
it
because
she
was
a
widow
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that's
because
she
was
an
executor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statutes
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
did
the
statute
say
that?
that
if
--
if
the
author
survives?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
--
i'm
not
questioning
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
just
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
executor
haven't
been
named
in
the
statute,
there'd
be
no
power
of
testamentary
disposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
are
other
contingencies
except
these
legal
contingencies
as
the
contingency
as
fashioned
as
the
contingency
of
fluctuating
public
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
those
contingencies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
we
can't
very
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
don't
think
that
really
we
can
talk
with
any
kind
of
issue
in
both
reality
that
anybody
can
really
be
--
as
on
safe
ground
as
if
he
talks
about
the
intention
of
congress
on
this
question,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
get
some
--
i
mean,
draw
some
inferences
from
the
fact
that
when
they
came
to
reconsider
the
--
the
copyright
law
in
1831,
they
omitted
the
then
living,
the
assignability
of
then
living.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
--
that
was
cutout
from
the
1790
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
one
were
to
lean
heavily,
i
don't
know
how
heavily.
it
is
a
fact
that
up
to
1831,
he
had
to
be
living
and
you
couldn't
then
have
argued
the
case
if
it's
not
being
argued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nobody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
then
living
was
a
change
in
congress,
it
isn't
arrived
wide
open.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
anyone.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
isn't
quite
it.
they
have
said,
“we
don't
want
the
widow
to
lose
because
she
might
--
might
most
need
ir
then.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
she
now
has
it.
there's
no
question.
you
and
mr.
abeles
have
agreed
that
the
widow
gets
the
statutory
unavailable
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
what
congress
--
when
congress
said,
“we
don't
want
that
between
the
widow
and
the
--
and
the
publisher,
we
prefer
the
widow.”
that
was
by
putting
in
the
executor,
the
author
living
can
now
(inaudible)
his
widow,
if
i
may
use
of
all
that
phrase.
he
is
very
--
he
can't
(inaudible)
the
widow
even
by
its
deciding
the
testamentary
powers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
he
chooses
(inaudible)
so
that,
her
rights
in
its
(inaudible)
by
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
quarrel
really
(inaudible)
what
controversy
in
this
case
is,
what
--
what
the
legal
consequences
are
including
the
executor,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
connection
to
that,
i
might
ask
you
that
one
can
get
no
life.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
can
get
no
right
from
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
talking
about
the
intention
of
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
none.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
if
we
have
to
construe,
what
--
what
words
they
used
because
they
didn't
shed
light
beyond
the
words
they
used,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
get
some
--
you
get
some
like
the
other
way
because
there,
they
require
them
to
be
alive
for
everybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
cut
that
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
you
stated
the
significance
a
minute
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
testamentary
disposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
suggesting
that
by
requiring
that
the
author
be
alive
at
the
termination
date
that
--
and
one
staff
is
deleted
as
it
was
in
1831,
then
it
opens
up
in
a
way,
the
general
problem
that
we
have
to
face
in
fisher
against
witmark
namely,
whether
this
should
be
allowed
at
all.
now,
as
you
quite
correctly
say,
you're
not
arguing,
you're
not
re
--
raising
that
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
no.
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understood
that
mr.
ladas
dealt
with
the
copyright
problem
but
it
was
--
excited
my
curiosity
of
what
mr.
abeles
read
from
ball
as
a
general
proposition
of
property
law
which
surely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
by
citing
--
but
not
by
reporting
that,
i'm
sure
you
wouldn't
defend
to
that
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
he
go
on
and
give
the
reason
as
to
general
law,
the
properties
that
you
can't
assign
something
you
haven't
got?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
certainly
personal
data
--
were
certainly
interesting
(inaudible)
data.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
any
--
any
bill
relating
to
that
subject
would
be
considered
around
the
clock,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
in
--
your
interpolating
if
he'd
be
living.
i
mean
that's
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
says,
yes.
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
our
first
claim
if
he'd
be
living
but
you
--
you
don't
carry
that
over
to
the
other,
you
don't
qualify
that
in
the
reference
for
the
rest
but
he
may
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
--
but
that
doesn't
deal
with
the
question
whether
while
living
he
makes
a
disposition
beyond
his
death.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
all
depends
how
we
construe
the
statute
and
you
can't
assume
the
conclusion
and
argue
there
from
--
he
hasn't
got
anything
and
those
questions
or
the
--
the
statute
doesn't
give
him
something
because
the
statute
projects
itself
beyond
his
death,
certainly,
as
to
the
wife
and
the
children.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
for
the
executor,
it
projects
itself.
so,
it
does
deal
with
a
term
beyond
his
living.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that
doesn't
answer
whether
he
may
have
disposed
of
that
power
by
doing
something
in
his
life.
i'm
not
saying
it
does.
all
i'm
saying
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
case
is
not
disposable
by
that
kind
of
logical
reasoning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
to
infer
from
what
you
said
that
the
--
that
the
author
could
make
a
contract
binding
his
executor
with
the
creation
of
a
right
for
specific
performance
by
the
assignee
so
far?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
by
specific
performance
i
mean
that
he
could
get
a
renewal
that
the
executor
would
have
to
in
his
designated
capacity
as
for
the
renewal
and
then
transfer
it,
that's
was
i
loosely
called
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
effect,
specific
performance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
question
isn't
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is,
i'm
--
i'm
interested
in
your
argument
that
this
could
be
accomplished
by
making
an
arrangement
using
a
neutral
term,
an
arrangement
in
the
light
of
the
author
who
predeceases
his
28th
year
and
yet
have
to
be
effectuated
by
the
executor
so
that
the
assignee
have
to
almost
get
the
reality,
namely
the
assignment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
think
it
raises
a
number
--
created
a
number
of
questions
that
we
did
not
decide
or
face
in
de
sylva
that
you
could
so
construe
the
copyright
law
that
you
could
work
out
an
assignment
that
after
the
author's
death
before
his
28th
year
in
some
states
not
in
other,
that
would
give
me
a
lot
of
trouble
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
--
we
have
to
catch
all
that
out
of
the
air
in
dealing
with
the
question
whether
an
author
who
dies
before
the
28th
year
can
effectuate
the
contingency
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
his
or
for
shorthand
called
assignee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fisher
case
decide
this
case
by
dictum?
justice
felix
frankfurter
closely
reprehensible
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
had
hoped
so
in
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
responsible
for
all
the
misquotations
by
even
eminent
members
of
the
bar.
i
see
even
less
that,
worst
--
worst
and
argue
about
my
performances.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
talking
--
(voice
overlap)
i'm
not
talking
how
they
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
we
end
up
that
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
of
here
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
you
don't
--
in
your
view
doesn't
give
anything
to
the
next
of
kin,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
your
--
on
--
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--because
--
because
the
--
this
--
because
the
testamentary
disposition
deter
--
controls
the
whole
disposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
wouldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
any
executor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
isn't
--
isn't
that
what
the
whole
litigation
is
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
maybe
what
you
just
said.
namely,
what
it
is
that
his
got
and
what
it
is
he
can
dispose
of?
we
have
to
decide
that
before
we
get
into
all
these
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
discussions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
must
say
i
can
--
i
can
understand
why
you're
here
and
the
argument
your
making
but
i
can't
understand
that
i'm
on
the
logic
of
compulsion
to
hold
that
because
congress
said
we
are
going
to
protect
the
man's
wife
and
his
children,
but
we
also
give
him
the
right
to
cut
them
off
if
he
wants
that
and
we
also
give
him
the
right
respecting
that
to
make
such
other
disposition
as
he
wants
to
make,
cut
out
all
his
next
of
kin
and
everybody
else.
that's
true
as
far
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
--
from
that
i
can't
--
you
draw
--
you
say
i'm
on
the
logic
of
compulsion
therefore
to
hold,
that
he
cannot
limit
the
--
that
(inaudible)
power,
the
power
to
leave
things
by
will
or
his
protecting
the
wife
and
children.
he
cannot
withdraw
or
limit
or
deprive
himself
of
that
by
selling
it
from
--
with
cash
in
his
lifetime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
you
said
that.
and
you
say
practically,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
did
understand
you
to
say
that
because
of
one
and
two,
that
sheds
light
on
three,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
you.
i
quite
agree
with
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
i
also
agree
with
you
that
i
mustn't
decide
it
your
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
an
--
that's
a
very
different
argument.
that
would
--
they
are
different
aspect
of
your
position,
namely
that
he
really
--
he
could
have
assigned
--
he
could
have
effectuated
in
his
lifetime.
he
get
the
power
of
renewal
after
28
years
although
he
is
dead
in
the
meantime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
argument,
as
he
could've
but
you
say
he
didn't
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
totally
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
they
carry
your
--
that
they
feel
but
all
i'm
saying
that
that
does
start
with
the
proposition
with
the
recognition
that
he
could
in
his
lifetime.
not
reaching
the
28th
year
--
not
reaching
the
28th
year,
he
could
have
disposed
of
this
contingency
in
his
lifetime,
so
he
predeceased
its
occurrence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that's
a
very
fair
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
--
it
doesn't
require
a
great
professional
courage
to
take
that
position.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
need
to
worry.
you
should
have
great
professional
courage.
you
are
here
to
win
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
respected
the
whole
of
your
argument.
let
me
face
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
more
profitable
for
you
that
we
don't.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
rudin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
put
it
to
you
that
the
petitions
for
writ
came
here
on
two
questions
and
you
accepted
the
questions
presented
so
that
the
point,
that's
why
it
was
a
fresh
matter
for
me.
the
point
you're
making
or
the
argument
you're
making
a
while
ago
that
assuming
there
could
be
an
assignment
this
isn't
--
but
this
doesn't
satisfy
the
requirement
for
such
an
assignment,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
say
that
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
that
--
that
is
not
open
under
the
statutes
presented
by
this
petition
with
which
you
agreed
i
think
in
your
--
in
your
respondent's
brief
in
our
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
two
reasons,
one,
it
couldn't
under
the
statute,
the
other
is
that
it
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
defend
a
judgement
on
any
ground
with
reference
to
the
--
to
the
decision
of
the
case
if
you
can't
bring
in
on
the
questions
presented,
another
issue
not
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
isn't
whether
you
or
mr.
abeles
--
or
you
and
mr.
abeles'
view
what
an
executor
is.
the
question
is
when
you
use
a
technical
term
like
“executor”,
what
lawyers
who
used
it
means
by
an
“executor”,
then
you
will
know
that
the
notion
of
an
executor
and
what
the
estate
is
called
the
“universitas”.
he
has
whatever
the
--
for
the
left.
even
your
case
of
a
power
of
appointment
is
not
outside
of
that
because
he
has
that
something
called
he
could
make
a
disposition
on
his
death
and
there
is
no
--
there's
no
immaterial
moment
there
between
the
death
of
the
executor
and
--
between
the
death
of
the
testator
and
the
executor.
he
just
slips
into
those
shoes
and
those
shoes
or
whatever
the
shoes
are,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
saying
now,
what
the
shoes
are.
it
depends
what
the
shoes
are
then
he
slips
into
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
have
to
decide
what
the
shoes
are
and
if
you
change
the
figure
if
there's
a
--
if
--
if
he
has
something
which
has
disposable
monetary
value,
then
he
can
take
care
of
it
by
his
will.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
--
he
has
--
sure
he
has
but
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
corrected
that.
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
and
corrected
that.
