justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
factual
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
said
yesterday,
that
--
that
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
original
assignment
by
the
author
that
assignments
were
given
by
the
--
his
next
of
kin,
as
well,
or
consented
to
his
assignment
was
considered.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
my
next
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
and
i
think
you've
answered
it
was,
whether
the
people
who
would
be
the
beneficiaries,
if
your
opponent's
position
is
--
were
sustained,
are
the
same
people
that
executed
these
consents
or
signed
the
(inaudible)
to
be
the
father
of
this
group.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
make
it
your
point.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
no.
i
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
next
of
kin,
if
there's
no
--
well,
gets
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
put
it
in
another
--
put
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
put
it
in
another
way,
your
position
in
drawing
these
distinctions,
i
take
it
is,
that
if
the
statute
was
designed
only
to
prevent
a
lapse
of
renewal
rights,
unmature
--
unmatured
renewal
rights
upon
the
death
of
the
author,
it
would've
been
enough
for
the
statute
to
provide
that
the
renewal
rights
passed
to
his
executor
or
the
administrator,
that's
your
point
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
might
be
right
if
the
widow
happened
to
be
the
executor.
