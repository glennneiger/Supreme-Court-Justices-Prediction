well
now,
on
the
record
in
this
case,
the
sums
do
not
seem
to
be
so
substantial,
it's
$1000
to
some
18
--
18
songs,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
if
he
didn't
--
if
he
didn't
survive
there
was
not
renewal
right
at
all,
in
anybody,
is
that
what
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
there's
always
a
contingency
at
least
hypothetically
that
there
won't
be
a
renewal
right,
isn't
there?
there
won't
be
any
at
all
(voice

justice
potter

i'm
--
i'm
thinking
of
the
case
of
a
man
who
dies
without
a
widow
and
without
a
--
without
children,
without
a
will
so,
therefore
without
an
executor
and
without
next
of
kin.
it's
possible,
and
--
and
--
as
a
street
case.
justice
potter
stewart
then
there
would
be
no
right
of
renewal?
justice
potter
stewart
and
no
matter
how
much
you
tried
to
tied
up
in
any
assignment
agreements
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
there
certainly
wouldn't
be
a
right
with
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
is
that
assuming
that
he
could
do
it,
still,
he
hasn't
done
it
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
into
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
fair
to
say,
mr.
rudin,
if
not,
tell
me
so
that
the
basic
difference
between
you
and
--
and
your
brother
forgetting
about
the
terms
of
this
particular
instrument
and
forgetting
about
that
--
that
question.
the
basic
difference
between
you
is
that
you
say
that
executor
under
the
statute
means
executor
as
representative
of
the
beneficiaries
and
that
he
says
that
executor
under
the
statute
means
executor's
representative
of
the
person
or
the
decedent.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
a
--
is
that
a
fair
basic
statement
of
the
difference
between
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
equivalent
of
an
executor.
