suppose
he
had
married
after
--
after
this
assignment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
legal
answer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
should
have
no
difficulty
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
pursuing
her
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
had
married
and
suppose
he
had
to
had
a
child
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
would
the
situation
be
as
to
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
wife
and
child
would
not
have
anything?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
under
the
statute,
does
it
make
any
distinction
between
the
wife
and
the
children
and
--
and
the
other
--
the
other
areas
of
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
well
--
well,
certainly.
that's
there
for
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
use.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
how
do
you
--
that
might
be
a
theory,
but
how
do
you
get
that
out
of
the
statute?
the
statute
says
that
the
copyrights
secured
by
this
title,
shall
incorporate
28
years
from
the
day
of
the
first
publication.
in
the
case
of
any
other
copyrighted
work,
the
author
of
such
work
is
still
living
or
the
widow,
widower,
or
children
of
the
author,
if
the
author
be
not
living
or
if
such
author
widow,
widower
or
children
be
not
living,
then
the
author's
executors
or
in
the
absence
of
a
will,
his
next
of
kin
shall
be
entitled
to
a
renewal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
how
do
you
distinguish
between
--
between
those
different
groups
of
--
of
people
there,
insofar
as
the
right
to
--
to
create
renewal
is
concerned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
case
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
citing
to
your
case
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
a
next
of
kin
is
a
next
of
kin,
too,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
same
sense
as
a
widow
is
a
widow.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
why
--
why
do
you
separate
the
next
of
kin
from
--
from
a
widow
insofar
as
the
right
of
renewal
is
concerned,
when
the
statute
says
that
either
of
them
under
certain
circumstances
can
avail
themselves
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
would
be
that
his
--
his
right
as
the
statutory
right
and
he
gets
whatever
rights
are
--
are
accorded
to
him
under
the
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

entitled
to
28
years
and
if
that
28
years
expires
while
he's
living,
he
has
a
right
to
renew
it
and
if
it
expires
after
he's
dead,
something
else
happens.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
--
i
--
the
only
question
i
want
to
have
you
explained
to
me
if
you
--
if
you
could,
how
the
words
of
the
statute
give
you
the
right
to
make
these
distinctions
that
you're
making?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rudin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
this
case
on
all
force
with
fisher
in
your
judgment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there
we
have
fisher
either,
did
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no
indeed
you
have
more
time
--
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
but
he
did
lived
the
28th
years,
didn't
he?
