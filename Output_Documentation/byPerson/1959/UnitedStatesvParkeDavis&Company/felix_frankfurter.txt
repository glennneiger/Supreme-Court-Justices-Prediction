he
didn't
--
didn't
retain
the
bill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
not
retain
the
bill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
explicit
indication
that
it
presents
if
they
did
not
fall
in
with
the
policy
of
parke
davis,
parke
davis
would
not
sell
to
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
if
there's
any
expression
by
anybody
on
behalf
of
parke
davis,
not
the
inferences
that
would
you
please
the
likely
inferences
drawn
by
the
wholesales.
if
parke
davis
ever
make
order
that
they
would
cut
off
wholesalers
who
didn't
fall
into
the
line.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
telling
you
--
i'm
not
talk
--
talking
about
the
legal
of
consequences
of
the
answer,
whatever
it
may
be
to
my
question,
but
you're
not
challenging
that
finding,
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that
but
you're
not
challenging
that
the
finding,
you're
not
--
you
--
you're
not
pointing
to
anything
in
the
record
whereby
parke
davis
were
explicit
in
saying
if
we
do
this
of
course
you
understand
the
consequences
to
any
similar
suggestions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
said
is
a
different
question?
i'm
asking
whether
they
were
explicit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
evidence
that
--
is
there
any
evidence
that
such,
they
knew
that
that
the
inference
could
be
drawn,
i'm
going
over
to
your
suggestion
of
it,
the
inference
would
--
could
be
drawn
because
of
past
experience.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
my
question.
i
mean
know
something
in
sense
that
i
draw
an
inference
but
the
basis
of
that
inference
is
what
i'm
after.
have
they
had
experience?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
my
question
is
of
course
the
colgate
case
to
which
you
will
come,
and
the
use
of
the
term
“coercion”
by
the
judge
in
his
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
want
to
know
what
exactly
the
facts
are
for
which
i
can
draw
my
inference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
attacking
is
the
judges'
failure
to
draw
your
inference
on
that
finding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
you're
after?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
--
but
he
does,
if
he
pursues
that
conduct
without
announcing
it,
would
that
be
--
offends
the
sherman
law
as
you
conceive
it?
suppose
he
does
all
that,
suppose
these
are
all
dumb
people
who
can't
speak
but
they
do
this
thing
without
announcing
what
they
are
doing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
would
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
the
fact
that
he
announced
that
he
is
going
to
not
deal
with
people
who
don't
observe
his
price
shifting,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
colgate
flat
or
you
think
that
you
can
distinguish
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
doing
that
when
you
get
around
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
wholesalers
and
retailers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
both
announcing
to
wholesalers,
they
won't
deal
with
them?
i'm
talking
colgate,
i'm
not
announcing
to
the
wholesalers,
we
won't
deal
with
them,
if
they
don't
observe
the
price
to
the
retailers
and
also
the
same
thing
to
the
retailers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
announcing
it
and
knowing
that
those
consequences
would
follow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
else
have
you
got?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
that
was
colgate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
colgate
were
much
more
general
in
--
in
trying
to
effectuate
their
policy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
was
there
agreement
here
for
the
president
of
club?
you
can
call
them
agreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
has
been
--
this
was
consensual
rather
than
coercive,
do
you
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
consensual.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
your
disagreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
fellow
that
is
coerced
doesn't
agree.
he
agrees
on
the
compulsion
and
that
is
in
consensual.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
he
does
that
rather
than
suffer
the
consequences
of
not
being
good.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
an
agreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
rather,
is
it
an
agreement
different
from
--
from
colgate,
that's
what
i
want
to
know?
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
colgate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
--
you
think
if
this,
if
the
government
wins
this
case
and
parke
davis
hadn't
scrupulously
followed
colgate,
the
result
would
be
in
the
slightest
different
to
the
negligence
or
to
commerce
or
to
business
or
to
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
accept
the
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
colgate
enforced
them,
people
knew
their
business,
they
knew
it,
they
didn't
--
because
they
didn't
live
up
that
colgate
would
cut
them
off,
they
told
them
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
about
colgate
is
that
if
they
agree,
they
can
be
sued
for
breach
of
contract.
if
they
don't
agree,
you
say
colgate
says
a
businessman
has
a
right
to
say,
"i'll
sell
you
my
goods
but
on
these
conditions.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
free
either
to
accept
or
reject
the
condition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
what
the
matter?
