mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
third
time
i've
to
argue
this
question
to
a
court.
we
had
it
in
the
criminal
case
and
the
judge
threw
the
case
out
of
the
close
of
that
record.
they
called
the
same
witnesses
and
a
few
more
in
the
civil
case,
i
argued
it
again
and
he
threw
the
case
out.
and
now,
i
find
myself
in
this
situation
that
i
come
up
before
a
nine
of
you
gentlemen
and
i
have
to
discuss
a
testimonial
case.
you
could
put
the
exhibits
in
this
case
in
the
back
of
this
book
and
pay
no
attention
to
them.
this
is
not
exhibit
antitrust
case.
there
were
17
human
beings
who
took
the
stand
and
who
testified
and
their
testimony
was
analyzed
and
examined
by
the
judges
who
sat
as
triers
of
fact.
their
testimony
is
conflicting.
they
said
sometimes
on
cross
something
quite
different
than
they
said
under
direct
when
they
were
led
by
mr.
kenny
down
the
route,
he
wanted
them
to
go.
they
said
things
differently
than
our
witnesses
said
about
the
same
transactions
and
the
judge
who
tried
this
case
had
the
obligation
of
weighing
and
deciding
what
the
true
facts
were.
now,
when
the
government
comes
up
here
on
one
of
these
cases
and
the
defendant
has
lost
and
the
defendant
says
that
the
evidence
in
some
way
or
other
wasn't
properly
weighed
by
the
judge,
there
are
cries
of
anguish
from
the
government
table
that
the
rule
of
this
court
must
prevail,
that
the
--
that
you
will
not
go
back
into
a
record
and
reexamine
it
that
the
findings
will
stand.
if
you
want
to
read
what
i
say
in
this
case,
just
read
what
the
government
said
to
you
in
the
international
boxing
case
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief.
now,
that's
by
way
of
preliminary,
but
i
--
i
say
to
you
that
this
is
a
case
where
if
you
follow
the
route
that
has
been
suggested
to
you
by
counsel
who
just
argued,
you
will
be
obligated
to
go
down
into
this
record
and
makeup
your
own
mind
as
to
the
trustworthiness
and
the
reliability
of
conflicting
testimony
from
witnesses.
the
principal
witness
here,
mr.
haft,
who
was
the
complaining
witness
to
the
antitrust
division
was
working
under
the
careful
guidance
of
his
own
counsel
looking
forward
to
treble
damage
case.
he
was
caught
in
frequent
inconsistencies.
and
i
say
to
you
that
if
you
sat
in
the
courtroom
and
watched
him
gait
when
some
these
questions
were
asked
and
watched
him
squirm
on
the
stand,
you
wouldn't
have
believed
the
word
he
said.
now,
our
position
is
simply
this
that
we
instructed
our
salesmen,
parke
davis
instructed
our
salesmen
to
got
out
and
say
to
the
trade
the
following.
“if
you
do
not
sell
at
our
suggested
minimum
prices,
we
will
cut
you
off.”
and
they
went
out,
were
instructed
to
go
up
to
the
wholesalers
and
say,
"if
you
do
not
sell,
if
you
do
sell
to
price
cutting
retailers,
we
will
cut
you
off."
the
court
found
that
those
were
the
instructions
and
the
court
also
found
that's
exactly
what
the
salesmen
did.
now,
i
can't
conceive
of
anything
that
is
purer
colgate
than
that,
a
simple
statement,
announcement
of
the
policy
and
a
carrying
out
of
that
policy
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
that
were
given.
and
those
instructions
incidentally,
are
shown
by
this
record
to
have
been
given
to
these
people
under
confident
legal
advice
as
to
what
the
guideposts
were
under
this
colgate
doctrine.
now
i
say
to
you
that
the
colgate
doctrine
is
not
some
theoretical
abstract
idea,
but
this
is
a
rule
that
has
guided
businessmen
ever
since
the
case
came
down
and
it's
an
integral
part
of
our
commercial
life.
and
when
these
people
who
are
responsible
businessmen
went
about
it
with
regard
to
their
right
to
select
their
customer
and
the
court
found
that
is
all
they
did
then
it
seems
to
me
the
findings
must
be
sustained
below,
and
there
is
no
basis
here
for
upsetting
the
judgment.
now,
let's
examine
what
the
government
says
are
the
reasons
why
this
case
must
be
upset.
they
--
they
say
as
i
understand
them
in
effect
that
a
legal
implication
of
agreement
is
essential
here
because
of
two
aspects
of
the
conduct.
one,
that
the
colgate
doctrine
was
applied
as
to
wholesalers
and
the
second,
that
some
of
these
customers
were
reinstated.
now,
those
are
the
two
points
that
would
make
you
an
argument
today.
there
were
wholesalers
in
the
colgate
case.
there
were
wholesalers
in
the
beech-nut
case.
this
court
has
never
said
that
the
colgate
doctrine
doesn't
apply
to
wholesalers
just
as
much
as
it
does
to
any
other
class
of
customer
or
trade.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
pure
--
purely
pleading
question,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
very
--
the
absence
of
the
indictment
to
plead
agreement
resulted
in
the
indictment
being
thrown
out.
so,
there
was
no
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that
--
that
is
right.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
their
allegations
in
the
indictment
of
sales,
the
wholesalers
but
it
came
up
on
purely
procedural
basis.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
there
were
also
wholesalers
in
beech-nut
when
the
decree
there
was
passed
in
by
the
court,
there
was
no
prohibition
against
defying
the
colgate
rule
to
wholesalers.
now,
counsel
here
says,
you
--
this
is
a
boycott,
and
that's
simply
an
example
of
the
use
of
a
nasty
word
to
get
over
a
deficiency
in
his
proof.
if
we
reach
an
agreement
with
the
wholesalers
for
concerted
action,
of
course
it
would
have
been
a
boycott,
but
the
question
is,
did
we
reach
an
agreement
or
did
we
as
the
court
found
merely
say
to
these
wholesalers,
“if
you
sell
to
price-cutting
retailer,
we'll
cut
you
off.”
that
is
no
boycott,
that's
merely
the
exercise
of
a
colgate
right.
and
when
they
suggest
to
you
it's
a
boycott,
they
jump
over
the
fact
that
the
court
throughout
here
found
there
was
no
agreement
of
that
kind
with
the
wholesalers.
of
course,
if
there
was
an
agreement
with
the
wholesalers,
you
don't
have
to
call
it
a
boycott.
it
doesn't
come
within
colgate
anyhow.
it's
a
price
of
arrangement
and
it's
improper,
but
there
was
no
such
agreement
on
these
findings.
now,
i
--
i
think
that
perhaps
what
i
can
do
here
is
to
put
this
case
in
a
bit
more
perspective
than
you
had
it
today.
in
the
first
place
what
we're
concerned
with
here
is
a
case
that
involved
conduct
in
this
district
of
columbia
area
for
a
period
of
about
six
or
eight
months
at
the
most,
in
1956.
we
--
counsel
referred
parke
davis
as
one
of
the
leading
drug
company,
it's
what
it
is.
the
record
shows
that
in
this
market
it
had
about
5%
of
the
business.
it
had
no
system
of
policing,
no
card-index
system,
no
marked
goods,
no
cooperative
arrangement
with
its
wholesalers
or
its
jobbers,
no
system
of
licensing,
no
joint
trade
activities
of
any
kind.
this
--
this
company
was
simply
going
ahead
selling
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
like
its
many
competitors
and
there
was
as
between
them
very
substantial
price
competition.
what
happened
was,
that
a
man
by
the
name
of
haft
who
ran
dart
drug
company,
a
--
a
corporate
drug
house
here
in
--
in
washington,
began
to
advertise
very
substantial,
very
deep
price
cuts.
the
district
court
found
that
that
completely
demoralized
parke
davis'
trade.
why?
because
when
mr.
haft
advertised
these
deep
price
cuts,
he
was
not
advertising
for
the
purpose
of
selling
parke
davis
goods.
he
was
advertising
for
the
purpose
of
enticing
into
his
store
customers
who
came
to
get
a
bargain
on
parke
davis
and
then
he
switched
them
to
his
own
brands
for
his
own
purposes
and
that
the
court
found
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
price
cutting.
he
was
using
our
goods
and
our
name
as
scenery
to
get
people,
as
one
of
the
witnesses
said,
to
get
people
into
his
store
so
that
his
salesman
who
got
a
commission
for
selling
his
goods
and
didn't
get
any
commission
for
selling
parke
davis
goods
could
push
his
own
goods
on
which
he
had
a
larger
margin
of
profit.
he
was
also
demoralizing
the
trade
because
he
was
cutting
these
prices
to
a
point
where
he
was
offering
the
products
below
the
price
of
which
the
ordinary
everyday
corner
drug
store
could
buy
these
products.
and
so,
all
of
these
retailer
drugstores
lost
interest
in
trying
to
promote
parke
davis
goods
and
that
was
the
trade
in
the
traffic
on
which
parke
davis
depend.
so,
what
happened?
parke
davis
representatives
went
to
these
various
retailers,
and
there're
five
of
them
in
this
case
and
it
said,
“if
you
don't
stop
cutting
prices,
we
will
not
sell
to
you”
and
these
retailers
said,
“well,
in
effect,
we'll
cut
your
papers”
and
they
went
right
ahead
cutting
prices,
and
they
cut
prices
throughout
this
entire
period.
they
never
stopped.
they
were
never
in
a
situation
where
they
couldn't
get
goods
because
even
though
parke
davis
had
gone
to
the
wholesalers
and
said,
“if
you
sell
to
price-cutting
retailers,
we
will
not
sell
to
you.”
it
is
not
clear
that
all
of
those
wholesalers
exceeded
or
accepted
that
position.
and
in
any
event,
the
record
is
clear
that
the
retailers
continued
to
have
the
product
and
continued
to
sell
it
cut
prices
in
the
store.
so,
then
we
come
to
this
question
or
reinstatement
and
it
is
suggested
that
there
are
some
kind
of
element
of
contract
in
reinstating
a
customer.
i
don't
understand
that.
i
--
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be
so.
i
don't
see
how
they
can
be
any
different
element
of
agreement
there
than
when
you
say
to
a
man
strictly
within
your
colgate
rule,
"i
will
not
sell
to
you
if
you
cut
prices"
and
he
goes
ahead
and
does
not
cut
prices
that
you
sell
to
him.
there's
just
as
much
an
element
of
agreement
there,
but
what
happened
was
that
parke
davis
finding
the
price
cutting
continued,
that
it
had
been
completely
unsuccessful
in
eliminating
any
price
cutting,
went
and
suggested
that
they
would
continue
to
sell
to
these
customers
and
that
they
would
be
free
to
charge
any
price
they
wanted
in
their
store
but
they
simply
would
not
advertise
in
order
to
pull
in
these
customers
for
other
purposes.
and
for
a
period
of
about
a
month
or
six
weeks,
there
were
not
cut
price
ads
in
the
district
of
columbia
on
parke
davis
goods.
at
the
end
of
about
six
weeks,
that
was
the
end
of
that.
an
advertisement
appeared
on
the
paper.
everybody
else
began
to
advertise
and
parke
davis
threw
up
its
hand
and
said,
“well,
that's
all,
we've
had
it.”
just
lots
of
--
as
we
suggest
in
the
brief,
supporting
the
position
that
mr.
chaipy
took
in
his
article
of
this
whole
problem,
famous
article
of
this
whole
problem.
he
said,
"nobody
really
can
prevent
price
cutting
and
maintain
prices
if
he
strictly
followed
the
requirements
of
the
colgate
doctrine.”
we
never
were
able
to
prevent
it.
we
never
did
and
price
cutting
continued
throughout
this
period
and
has
continued
ever
since.
now,
i
don't
know
what
process
this
court
is
going
to
go
through
if
it
undertakes
to
reexamine
this
record
to
see
whether
these
various
challenged
findings
are
correct.
the
findings
say
that
an
agreement
was
not
solicited.
the
findings
say
specifically
as
to
each
of
these
particular
retailers
and
wholesalers
that
not
agreement
was
made.
the
trial
judge
stated
not
only
that
he
followed
the
testimony,
but
that
he'd
read
the
daily
transcript.
we
had
elaborate
arguments
about
these
findings.
the
government
opposed
our
finding.
they
submitted
alternative
findings.
they
filed
separate
motion
thereafter
to
set
aside
the
findings.
in
all,
i
think
we
had
two
or
three
briefs
in
argument
on
this
issue
and
the
trial
judge
came
to
his
conclusion.
if
you
go
through
this
evidence
and
you
undertake
this
task
of
retrying
this
case,
i
urge
that
you
not
be
misled
by
selective
bits
of
the
testimony
such
as
been
offered
to
you
on
argument
today
because
you
will
find
by
a
reading
of
the
entirety
of
the
record
that
are
totally
different
kind
of
a
picture
of
what
occurred
pertained
than
those
by
--
if
you
select
a
particular
item,
here
or
there.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
the
finding
is
that
the
wholesalers,
three
of
the
wholesalers
--
in
finding
14,
mr.
justice
black,
three
of
the
wholesalers
attempted
to
stop
their
sales
of
products
to
those
retailers
in
order
not
to
be
cutoff
themselves.
although
occasionally,
such
products
were
sold
by
inadvertence
to
those
retailers,
i
think
that's
the
finding.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
14
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
well,
if
--
if
they
--
if
they
do
not
continue
to
sell
to
the
price-cutting
retailers
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
--
then
they
would
remain
customers
of
parke
davis.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
no,
sir.
there's
no
question
of
agreement
here.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
they're
simply
told
a
policy
and
they
can
accept
the
policy
or
not
as
they
choose.
the
court
found
that
they
accepted
the
policy
not
because
of
any
agreement,
but
that
they
accepted
the
policy
because
of
their
own
self
interest.
they
desired
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
--
to
remain
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
they
would
have
been
cut
off,
just
as
the
retailers
were
cut
off.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that
is
right.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
and
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that
--
that's
what
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that's
our
position.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes
and
our
position
--
our
position
is
that
in
this
case,
none
of
the
--
none
of
the
facts
--
none
of
the
facts
in
this
case
fall
within
the
ambit
of
the
cases
like
bausch
&
lomb
and
effo
and
beech-nut
where
you
had
a
complicated
pattern
of
systematic
control
of
the
market,
tied
together
with
license
arrangements,
tied
together
with
espionage
and
reporting
system
with
trade
association
and
other
types
of
cooperative
activity.
this
is
simply
the
conduct
of
a
single
seller
in
a
small
market,
dealing
for
a
short
time
unsuccessfully
with
a
small
specific
aspect
of
his
problem.
and
if
--
if
you
say
that
colgate
doesn't
apply
to
this,
what
you
are
doing
is
what
i
suggest
the
government
really
wants
you
to
do,
you're
making
colgate
an
absolutely
meaningless
rule
of
law.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
the
magic
words
agree,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
--
black
determinant.
i
think
this
--
i
think
an
agreement
can
be
inferred
from
a
course
of
conduct
where
there
are
elements
of
coercion
and
practice
which
would
support
that,
but
the
court
found
nothing
of
that
kind
here
and
there
was
nothing
of
that
kind
here.
take
--
take
your
bausch
&
lomb
kind
of
situation,
where
everyone
is
tied
together
by
a
system
of
licensing
that
makes
each
dependent
on
the
other
and
where
over
a
long
period
time,
people
in
the
status
of
wholesalers
were
working
in
collaboration
with
the
seller
to
--
to
report
violators
and
bring
information
to
their
attention
and
to
see
that
they
were
stamped
out,
then
you
get
a
pattern
of
conduct
which
in
particularized
cases
could
lead
to
particular
results.
but
i
say
here,
none
of
those
elements
are
present
and
the
court
found
that
none
of
those
elements
are
present.
and
that
this
is
simply
the
pure
simple
expression
by
the
seller
of
his
colgate
rights
and
if
he
hasn't
the
right
to
do
this,
he
hasn't
the
right
to
do
anything
under
the
colgate
doctrine.
now,
let's
look
at
the
practicalities
of
this
matter,
if
i
may
will
you
for
a
minute.
reference
is
made
to
the
fact
that
we
--
there
was
some
discussion
concerning
what
others
were
doing.
well,
in
--
on
occasion
when
a
salesman
went
and
said,
“if
you
--
if
you
don't
--
if
you
don't
observe
our
policy
and
you
cut
prices,
we
won't
sell
to
you.”
the
other
fellow
says,
“what
about
the
guy
across
the
street?”
perfectly
natural
question
to
arise
or
a
man
says,
you
say
to
a
man,
"i
will
not
sell
to
you
if
you
cut
prices,"
and
he
says,
"i
agree.”
is
that
an
agreement
within
the
colgate
doctrine?
or
he
says,
"i'll
abide
by
your
wishes,
alright
i'll
go
along."
these
are
just
human
discourse
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
as
to
whether
an
agreement
was
sought,
an
agreement
was
solicited
or
an
agreement
in
--
in
any
legal
sense
to
coercion
or
otherwise,
was
obtained.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
no.
the
government
has
suggested
that
it
does
and
that
interstate
circuit
from
some
of
these
other
parallel
conduct
type
of
cases
too.
but
as
i
see
those
cases,
mr.
justice
black,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
certain
elements
present
that
are
not
present
here.
in
--
in
the
first
--
in
the
first
place,
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
some
of
the
conduct
that
was
parallel
is
conduct
that
is
--
is
conduct
that
comes
for
conspiratorial
reason
only
and
you
infer
therefore,
collaboration
because
there
is
a
working
together
in
a
manner
that
can
only
be
explained
in
terms
of
conspiracy.
the
--
the
movie
cases
are
--
are
classic
example
of
that.
or
they
are
situations
where
the
parallel
conduct
remains
wholly
unexplained
where
there
isn't
any
explanation
of
it.
well,
in
this
instance,
we
have
neither
of
those.
the
--
the
conduct
of
the
wholesaler
is
explained
on
this
record
and
explained
quite
clearly,
and
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
their
own
simple
economic
interest.
it
doesn't
in
anyway
purport
to
collaboration
or
cooperation
with
the
seller
in
his
design
or
even
if
there's
no
showing
that
they
have
any
stake
in
his
design.
there
is
not
a
single
instance
here
of
joint
action,
of
interdependent
action,
of
meetings
of
--
of
group
approach
to
this
problem
at
all.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
well,
they
--
they
would
have
--
(voice
overlap)
if
--
the
only
stake
they
would
have
would
be
of
getting
his
goods
and
of
course
that
they
--
they
have
to
cut
him
off
in
order
to
stay
as
a
customer.
so,
they're
--
they're
operating
contrary
to
that
state
and
that's
the
only
state
they
have.
these
wholesalers
handle
many,
many
products
and
many,
many
companies
and
they
want
to
sell
to
everybody.
they
don't
gain
anything
by
this.
this
--
the
--
this
was
a
situation
that
parke
davis
was
concerned
about
because
of
the
protection
of
its
own
trade.
thank
you,
your
honor.
