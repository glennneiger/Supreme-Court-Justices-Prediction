mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
which
is
here
on
direct
appeal
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
whether
certain
actions
taken
by
the
appellee,
one
of
the
country's
major
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
in
attempt
to
maintain
resale
prices
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
richmond,
virginia,
amounted
to
an
illegal
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act
or
whether
as
the
district
court
held
in
dismissing
the
case
at
the
close
of
the
government's
evidence,
parke
davis'
actions
did
not
amount
to
a
conspiracy
but
constituted
no
more
than
the
unilateral
selection
of
its
customers
which
is
permissible
under
the
doctrine
of
united
states
against
colgate
&
co.
the
government's
civil
complaint
in
this
case
charged
parke
davis
with
violating
sections
1
and
3
of
the
sherman
act
and
the
district
court
as
i
say
dismissed
it
on
the
ground
that
no
conspiracy
had
been
established
and
alternatively,
the
court
concluded
that
even
if
violations
had
been
established,
there
was
no
need
for
injunctive
relief
because
he
found
there
was
no
reasonable
probability
that
these
attempts
to
maintain
resale
prices
might
be
repeated
in
the
future.
now,
parke
davis
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
he
dismissed
it.
parke
davis
has
accused
the
government
in
this
case
of
bringing
an
antitrust
case
before
this
court
for
a
trial
de
novo.
they
say
that
all
the
factual
issues
were
determined
adversely
to
the
government
before
the
district
court
and
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
now,
i
want
to
emphatically
deny
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
retry
the
factual
issues
in
this
case.
as
i
believe
my
brief
statement
of
the
facts
will
show,
we
don't
think
there's
any
real
dispute
into
--
in
this
case
as
to
what
parke
davis
in
fact
did.
i
don't
think
there's
any
denial
of
the
actual
operative
facts
in
the
case.
the
critical
issue
is
whether
these
actions
taken
by
parke
davis
amounted
to
a
conspiracy
and
that
is
the
legal
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
particular
course
of
conduct.
now,
the
case
grew
out
of
an
attempt
in
1956
by
parke
davis
to
stop
price
cutting
by
certain
retailers
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
the
city
of
richmond,
virginia.
at
the
time
of
this
action,
neither
the
district
of
columbia
nor
virginia
was
a
fair
trade
area.
so
that,
at
that
time,
had
parke
davis
attempted
to
enter
into
resale
price
maintenance
with
these
individuals,
the
contracts
would
have
been
illegal.
parke
davis'
distribution
system
entails
selling
directly
to
the
retailers,
primarily
from
its
baltimore
area
office,
and
also
selling
to
certain
selected
wholesalers
in
the
area
and
the
wholesalers
then
in
turn
sell
to
the
retailers.
however,
since
parke
davis
gives
quantity
discounts,
which
it
does
not
permitted
wholesaler
to
give,
it
is
cheaper
to
the
retailers
to
purchase
directly
from
parke
davis
than
to
purchase
through
the
wholesalers.
now,
the
principal
activities
of
parke
davis
in
this
case
were
taken
against
five
retailers
in
this
area.
parke
davis
emphasized
that
they
are
only
five
out
of
some
200
involved
because
the
five
retailers
who
were
singled
out
were
the
leaders
in
this
price
cutting
campaign
and
that's
why
parke
davis
took
action
against
them.
the
parke
davis
price
policy
towards
the
retail
stores
is
set
out
in
its
price
list
and
the
parke
davis
price
list
policy
states
that
in
areas
having
fair
trade
laws,
these
prices
are
to
be
followed
and
in
areas
which
do
not
have
fair
trade
laws,
these
prices
are
suggested.
in
june
of
1956,
the
manager
of
the
parke
davis'
baltimore
office
attended
a
meeting
of
the
company
at
the
company's
headquarters
in
detroit
and
at
that
time
he
raised
the
question
what
they
could
do
about
this
price
cutting
that
is
going
on
in
the
district,
and
he
was
he
told
by
the
president
of
the
company
that
they
had
a
policy
that
they
would
not
sell
to
price-cutting
retailers
in
non-fair
trade
areas.
when
he
returned
from
his
meeting
in
detroit,
the
branch
manager
called
in
his
area
manager
for
washington
and
instructed
this
area
manager
to
go
and
cut
off
these
price
cutting
retailers
if
they
refused
to
conform
to
parke
davis'
policy
and
at
the
same
time
also
tell
them
to
see
to
it
that
the
wholesalers
cut
off
any
of
the
retailers
who
refused
to
go
along
with
this
policy.
in
19
--
early
in
july
1956,
the
parke
davis
representatives
visited
a
number
of
these
price
cutting
retailers.
they
advised
these
price
cutting
retailers
that
parke
davis
had
this
policy
of
selling
only
to
people
who
observed
the
state
of
resale
prices
and
furthermore,
warned
them
that
if
they
didn't
stop
this
practice
of
price
cutting,
parke
davis
would
cut
them
off
on
its
own
direct
sales
and
would
also
cut
them
off
on
the
sales
to
wholesalers.
in
several
instances,
when
they
spoke
to
the
retailers,
they
also
advised
them
that
they
were
seeing
other
retailers
in
the
areas.
five
of
these
people
who
were
approached,
refused
to
stop
price
cutting.
parke
davis
then
cut
them
off
on
direct
sales
and
also
told
the
wholesalers
or
requested
the
wholesalers
to
stop
selling
to
them.
now,
parke
davis
suggests
that
all
it
did
in
approaching
the
retailers
and
the
wholesalers
was
to
announce
its
policy
to
them
and
that's
its
basic
defense
in
this
case.
they
said,
"we
have
a
policy,
we
wouldn't
sell
to
you,
and
we
just
announced
this
policy
and
left
it
up
to
them
to
decide
what
to
do.”
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
the
testimony,
two
sentences
from
one
of
the
wholesalers,
it's
at
page
198
of
the
record.
this
is
the
vice
president
of
one
of
the
wholesalers
who
was
describing
his
conversations
with
the
parke
davis
representatives
when
they
came
to
visit
them,
at
the
top
of
page
198
and
after
he
was
asked
if
he
could
stop
selling.
question,
“what
did
you
tell
them,
sir?”
answer,
"i
asked
them
if
they
were
requesting
it
of
me
alone
or
would
they
go
to
the
other
wholesalers,
and
they
said
they
would
visit
the
local
wholesalers
and
then
i
agreed
to
abide
by
it”
and
he
repeated
the
same
statement
later
on
at
page
206.
so,
that
we
think
at
this
initial
stage
of
approaching
the
--
the
wholesalers
and
the
retailers,
parke
davis
then
and
there
did
far
more
than
just
announcing
its
policy.
the
testimony
of,
mr.
grips,
the
area
manager
of
parke
davis
in
baltimore
is
to
the
effect
that
he
instructed
his
man
to
go
and
request
them
to
give
this
out.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
mr.
estren
--
i'm
sorry
mr.
levin
who
was
the
vice
president
of
the
district
wholesalers,
one
of
the
three
drug
wholesalers
in
the
district,
who
--
mr.
aspirin
--
mr.
--
mr.
s
--
mr.
levin
--
sorry,
was
initially
was
approached
by
parke
davis
and
then
sometime
later,
he
was
again
approached
by
parke
davis
with
a
complaint
from
parke
davis
that
they
had
found
an
invoice
of
this
company
in
one
of
the
retail
stores
and
thereafter,
instructions
went
out
to
completely
discontinue
dealing
with
the
company.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
--
well,
it's
--
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
accepted
as
true
because
the
district
court
did
not
refer
to
that.
the
district
court
seemingly
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
based
his
decision
on
the
erroneous,
we
believe,
legal
conclusion
that
absent
anything
in
a
way
of
specific
agreements,
this
conduct
was
perfectly
permissible.
parke
davis
did
not
put
in
its
case.
the
case
was
dismissed
at
the
conclusion
of
the
government's
evidence
and
we
just
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
were
quite
elaborate
findings
of
fact,
but
the
findings
of
fact
do
not
deal
with
respect
with
this
issue
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
of
the
testimony
except
to
one
extent
and
we
do
challenge
the
finding
to
the
extent
that
it
suggests
that
parke
davis
did
not
discuss
with
the
individuals
that
visited,
what
it
was
doing
with
respect
to
the
other
ones
and
that
finding,
we
think
is
somewhat
ambiguous,
but
we
are
not
attacking
in
this
case,
the
any
--
with
two
miles
exception
to
the
specific
findings
in
that
area.
we
are
challenging
what
we
believe
to
be
the
conclusory
findings
that
all
of
these
did
not
amount
to
an
agreement.
that
is
our
basic
attack
on
the
district
court's
decision.
with
one
brief
exception
after
parke
davis
had
visited
the
retailers
and
the
wholesalers,
the
retailers
were
unable
to
buy
any
parke
davis
products
for
approximately
seven
weeks,
although
there
is
evidence
by
the
wholesalers
that
a
few
orders
might
have
been
filled.
now,
we
then
skip
to
the
end
of
august
at
which
point
the
retailers
had
been
cutoff
on
parke
davis
products.
on
that
day,
the
two
principal
officials
of
the
baltimore
office
of
parke
davis,
on
their
own
initiative,
visited
three
of
the
price-cutting
retailers
in
the
district.
the
first
man
they
went
to
was
the
president
of
the
dart
drug
company,
a
mr.
haft.
there's
a
disagreement
into
the
testimony
as
to
where
the
suggestion
emanated,
but
it
is
conceded
that
at
that
meeting
it
was
suggested
that
if
mr.
haft
would
take
down
this
sign,
these
advertisements
in
the
windows
cutting
prices
that
parke
davis
would
then
resume
shipping
to
him
and
at
the
point,
mr.
--
and
also
the,
some
of
the
newspaper
ads,
at
that
point,
mr.
haft
indicated
that
this
was
agreeable.
they
then
left
mr.
haft
and
went
to
each
of
the
two
--
two
other
price
cutters
in
the
area
and
they
told
each
of
these
individuals
that
they
had
discussed
the
matter
with
haft
and
it
was
agreeable
to
haft
to
take
down
his
signs
if
parke
davis
would
resume
selling
to
them
and
queried
them
whether
they
would
be
willing
to
go
along
with
such
a
proposal
and
each
of
these
individuals
in
effect
said
yes,
they
would
if
the
others
were
doing
it.
after
these
visits,
the
stores
took
down
their
signs
although
they
were
free
under
parke
davis'
suggestion
to
continue
selling
their
products
inside
and
parke
davis
resumed
selling
to
them
and
also
notified
the
wholesalers
that
the
wholesalers
might
again
resume
selling
to
the
price-cutting
retailers.
and
of
course
the
importance
of
the
advertising
and
the
signs
is
that
if
you
are
a
price
cutter,
it's
obviously
terribly
important
that
that
fact
be
brought
home
to
the
members
of
the
consuming
public.
for
a
period
of
about
two-and-half
months
thereafter,
with
one
exception
again
which
apparently
was
inadvertent,
there
was
no
price-cutting
advertising
in
the
district
of
columbia.
in
the
middle
of
november,
the
situation
as
parke
davis
described,
it
blew
up
again
when
one
of
these
people
again
ran
an
ad
and
thereafter,
the
price
cutting
again
resumed.
now,
these
facts
that
i
have
stated,
i
believe
are
basically
not
disputed.
i
mean,
parke
davis
does
not
deny
that
it
approached
the
retailers
and
said
it
would
cut
them
off,
that
it
went
to
the
wholesalers
and
it
told
the
wholesalers
that
was
dealing
with
others
that
it
requested
the
wholesalers
to
cut
them
off
on
that
on
its
own
initiative,
it
subsequently
approached
the
retailers
and
suggested
a
modification
of
the
situation
as
it
had
existed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
the
wholesalers
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
--
there
was
testimony
by
the
wholesalers
that
they
knew
if
they
did
not
agreed
to
parke
davis
request',
parke
davis
would
cut
them
off.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
as
for
--
that
that
the
district
court
concluded
there
was
no
evidence
that
they
had
solicited
an
agreement
with
them.
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
challenging
it
to
the
extent
that
it
embodies
a
legal
conclusion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
don't
think
it
was
--
it
was
necessary,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
they
explicitly
came
and
said,
"if
you
do
not
stop
selling
to
these
people,
we
will
cut
you
off."
there's
nothing
explicit
about
that
statement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
wholesalers
testified
that
they
knew
if
they
did
not
exceed
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
nothing
to
show
in
this
record
that
at
anytime,
a
wholesale
had
been
in
the
past
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
cut
off.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
recollect
the
specific
evidence
in
the
record
that
reflected
this
conversation
but
i
assume
this
finding
is
based
on
the
implicit
understanding
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
were
not
attacking
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
we
think
the
inference
had
to
be
drawn
from
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
now,
i'd
like
to
come
to
the
basic
law
in
this
field
which
we
think
is
the
basic
principles
are
not
disputed.
the
colgate
case
as
it
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
subsequently,
has
very
strictly
limited
a
right
to
the
manufacturer
in
refusing
to
sell,
where
refusal
to
sell
is
a
means
of
enforcing
resale
price
maintenance.
the
cases
have
indicated
that
the
manufacturer's
right
is
limited
to
an
announcement
of
the
policy.
they
may
announce
in
advance
the
policy,
the
conditions
under
which
they
will
not
sell
and
they
will
also
--
may
also
cut
off,
refuse
to
deal
with
someone
who
does
not
exceed
to
that
policy.
the
cases
have
also
indicated,
however,
that
a
manufacturer
cannot
go
beyond
the
simple
right
of
refusing
to
sell
and
announcing
his
policy.
now,
we
think
that
in
this
case,
what
the
record
shows
is
something
far
more
than
unilateral
action
by
parke
davis
in
announcing
a
policy
and
refusing
to
deal
with
individuals
who
fail
to
comply
with
that
policy.
in
the
first
place,
parke
davis
cut
off
the
wholesalers,
the
retailers
and
refused
to
deal
with
them
when
they
didn't
accede
to
its
policy,
it
didn't
stop
at
that
point.
it
then
went
to
the
wholesalers
and
told
the
wholesalers
that
they
too
must
stop
selling
to
parke
davis.
this
in
simple
antitrust
language
is
what
is
called
a
boycott.
parke
davis
in
combination
with
the
wholesalers
brought
the
economic
pressure
to
bear
on
the
retailers.
the
evidence
shows
that
the
wholesalers
were
not
only
told
of
this
fact,
but
were
told
--
not
only
requested
to
do
this
but
were
also
advised
that
other
wholesalers
were
being
brought
into
this
thing
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
found
that
--
held
the
conscious
participation
in
a
common
plan
where
the
aim
of
the
plan
is
restraint
of
trade
is
enough
to
establish
a
conspiracy.
the
evidence
further
shows
that
the
brining
of
the
wholesalers
into
the
case
was
an
integral
part
of
the
whole
plan
at
the
very
beginning.
the
manager
of
parke
davis'
baltimore
branch
told
his
assistant
to
bring
pressure
to
bear
not
only
on
the
retailers
but
on
the
wholesalers
and
the
retailers
in
turn
were
warned,
that
if
they
didn't
go
along
with
parke
davis,
not
only
would
they
be
cut
off
on
purchases
from
parke
davis
but
also
on
purchases
from
the
wholesalers.
now,
the
participation
of
the
wholesalers
was
of
course
a
vital
element
in
the
whole
plan
because
as
long
as
the
retailers
had
an
alternative
source
of
supply
available,
even
at
a
somewhat
higher
price,
there
wouldn't
be
any
very
effective
pressure
on
them.
it
was
only
when
parke
davis
brought
to
bear
the
combined
force
of
cutting
them
off
directly
and
also
indirectly
that
this
thing
would
have
a
really
vital
pinch.
and
finally,
we
think
the
situation
is
doubly
significant
because
not
only
did
parke
davis
request
the
wholesalers
not
to
sell
to
the
retailers,
but
it
didn't
give
them
the
green
light
to
resume
selling
until
after
the
retailers
had
indicated
that
they
would
take
down
their
signs
and
stop
their
advertising.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
was
not
quite
in
those
terms,
there
was
testimony
that
they
advised
each
of
the
retailers
as
to
what
the
other
was
doing
and
in
one
instance
i
believe,
one
of
the
men
did
say
that
if
it's
agreeable
with
--
if
the
other
people
are
doing
it,
i
will
do
it.
there's
not
ever
a
i
have
a
testimony
showing
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice
and
also
with
respect
to
mr.
strauss
of
state
drugs,
pages
119
and
120
of
the
record
another
one
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
119
and
120.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
way
about
six
or
eight
lines
from
the
bottom
of
the
page.
“the
gentleman
asked
if
i
would
be
willing
to
take
my
prices
down,
of
course
sell
it
on
the
inside
if
the
other
so
called
discounts
stores
ceased
advertising
in
the
paper.
i
informed
them
that
i
would
be
very
paper
happy
to.”
now,
another
respect
we
think
in
which
parke
davis
went
beyond
the
mere
exercise
of
its
rights
to
select
customers
is
the
fact
that
after
the
retailers
had
been
cut
off,
it
was
parke
davis
that
took
the
initiative
in
re-approaching
the
wholesalers
in
an
obvious
attempt
to
see
if
this
matter
couldn't
be
straightened
out.
parke
davis
made
its
selection
of
customers
when
it
cut
these
people
off,
but
we
don't
think
that
the
colgate
case
permits
a
manufacturer
and
it
selects
its
customers,
to
then
come
around
and
say,
"we'll
be
glad
to
have
you
again
as
a
customer,
but
we
want
you
to
do
certain
things
which
have
the
effect
of
minimizing
the
effectiveness
of
your
price
competition.”
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
whether
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
whether
he
used
the
words
or
not.
it's
--
it's
the
actual
fact
that
happened,
in
other
words
the
actual
business
relation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right
and
refuses
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
that
it
can
be
distinguished.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'll
attempt
to
do
it
right
now.
the
--
i
think
the
distinction
is
that
all
that
colgate
permits
is
the
announcement
of
your
policy
and
the
refusal
to
deal
with
people
who
refuse
to
accede
to
your
policy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
both
wholesalers
and
retailers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
you
had
--
if
--
if
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
--
if
all
we
had
was
a
mere
announcement,
i
think
that
probably
would
be
covered
by
colgate,
but
that's
not
what
we
have
in
this
case,
we
have
a
lot
more
than
mere
announcement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
have
the
approaching
of
these
individuals,
requesting
them
affirmatively
to
cease
dealing.
we
have
the
going
back
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
i
think
as
colgate
came
to
this
court
on
merely
a
construction
of
the
indictment,
this
court
held
that
under
the
colgate
doctrine,
there
had
been
no
agreement
alleged
in
that
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
we
think
there
was
an
agreement
going
out
of
the
fact
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
was
coerced,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
economic
coercion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
also
(voice
overlap)
gave
--
i
think
the
coercion
resulted
a
consensual
undertaking.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
think
they
meant
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
are
many
situations
where
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
we're
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
because
colgate
does
reflect
a
basic
right
of
a
manufacturer,
that
a
manufacturer
has
the
right
to
select
his
customers.
i
think
that
an
example
of
the
exercise
of
that
right
is
shown
in
this
record.
after
mr.
haft
had
testified
at
the
criminal
case
which
the
government
lost
here,
parke
davis
sent
him
a
letter
saying,
"we
do
not
wish
to
have
any
further
dealings
with
you
and
we're
closing
your
account.”
they
cut
him
off,
they
did
not
attempt
to
persuade
the
wholesalers
not
to
deal
with
them.
they
let
him
go
have
his
business.
i
think
that's
the
reason
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
overrule
colgate
because
we
recognize
that
colgate
does
represent
a
basic
right
of
the
manufacturer,
but
we
are
asking
this
court
to
make
--
to
indicate
that
the
rights
under
colgate
must
be
strictly
limited
merely
to
give
the
manufacturer
the
right
to
select
his
customers
and
to
announce
his
policy
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
might,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
might,
mr.
justice,
because
i
think
without
these
devices
of
enforcing
this
policy
that
they
will
not
be
able
carry
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
i
think
there's
more
here
than
is
shown
in
the
colgate
record.
i
--
i
would
like
to
refer
briefly
to
one
of
the
aspect
of
this
case
at
this
time
which
is
the
district
court's
alternative
holding
that
even
if
a
conspiracy
had
been
established,
there
was
no
need
for
any
injunctive
relief.
the
district
court
based
that
holding
on
three
different
grounds.
first,
the
district
court
held
that
the
practices
had
been
abandoned.
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
the
abandonment
had
been
made
in
good
faith
and
has
been
forced
upon
the
company
by
the
economic
and
business
conditions
in
the
field.
and
that
in
fact,
the
company
could
not
resume
these
practices
without
heavy
economic
loss.
now,
the
only
thing
shown
by
this
record
as
to
the
reason
for
abandonment
is
the
testimony
of
parke
davis'
assistant
general
attorney
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
abandonment
was
this
antitrust
investigation.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
parke
davis
could
not
resume
these
practices
without
heavy
loss
or
that
they
were
forced
upon
it,
this
abandonment
was
forced
on
it
by
business
and
economic
conditions.
there
is
not
even
in
this
record
a
disclaimer
by
parke
davis
that
it
will
not
resume
these
challenged
practices
in
the
future,
unlike
the
grant
case
where
the
men
involved
in
the
interlocking
the
record
state
that
he
would
not
resume.
there's
no
such
evidence
at
all
in
this
case.
all
that
we
had
basically
here
is
abandonment
resulting
in
part
from
the
investigation
conducted
by
the
government.
and
we
think
that
it's
well
settled
that
the
mere
fact
of
abandonment
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
deny
the
government
the
right
to
injunctive
relief
and
we
think
that
on
this
face
of
the
case
too,
the
district
court
erred
in
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
further
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
gesell
has
stated
that
all
that
was
involved
in
this
case
was
a
simple
expression
of
colgate
right
as
he
calls
them
by
parke
davis.
they
just
announced
the
policy
and
left
it
to
individuals
whether
to
accept
the
policy
or
to
reject
the
policy.
i
just
like
to
refer
the
court
briefly
to
the
testimony
of
the
wholesalers
as
to
how
this
policy
was
put
up
to
them.
first,
page
125
of
the
record,
one
of
the
wholesalers
questioned
by
mr.
gardner,
"did
they
say
anything
about
you
selling
to
retailers
who
cut
prices?”
“yes,
that
was
the
statement
that
we
shouldn't
sell
to
retailers
at
cut
prices”
and
at

164,
testimony
by
mr.
russell,
a
wholesaler
in
richmond,
virginia.

and
instructed
not
to
sell

goods

of

branches.

are
