justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
significance
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
evidence
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
that
about
tying
to
sell
the
newspaper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
evidence
here
as
to
what
this
part
of
the
top
fraction,
if
he
ever
made
a
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
evidence
--
did
he
ever
discuss
any
terms?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it
â€“
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
particularly
discuss?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
would
you
--
is
there
any
place
in
here
whether
you
defined
what
this
plenum
is?
i
understood
what
you
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it
defined?
i
want
to
see
it.[laugh]
i'm
curious
about
it
like
some
of
the
other
justices.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
were
punishment,
would
it
be
a
bill
of
attainder?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
it
wouldn't
be
punishment
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
argue.
i
ask
you,
does
an
alien
of
this
kind
have
a
right
to
invoke
any
of
the
constitutional
provision
than
if
they
had?
justice
hugo
l.
black
outside
of
that,
is
an
alien
barred
from
claiming
the
benefits
of
the
due
process
clause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
congress
could
not
--
under
that
pass
of
law
which
would
take
away
the
man's
(inaudible)
without
a
trial
even
though
he's
an
alien.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
liberty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
government
would
provide
that
suits
for
civil
damages
against
aliens
that
could
not
be
tried
by
jury,
could
they
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
the
jury
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it's
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
i
think
that
is
correct,
but
that's
why
you
have
to
get
to
--
to
--
is
that
they
have
a
right
to
send
an
alien
off
with
or
without
a
trial
and
with
or
without
any
proceedings
if
congress
decides
to
do
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
what
about
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
said
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
they
raised
on
it
but
the
bill
of
attainder.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
just
the
bill
of
attainder
is
perhaps,
it
designed
as
much
to
protect
people
in
the
right,
procedural
rights
of
any
other
part
of
the
country.
