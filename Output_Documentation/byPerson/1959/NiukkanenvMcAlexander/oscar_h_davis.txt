mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
it
maybe
helpful
if
i
point
out
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument
that
the
original
record
in
the
case
was
simply,
the
record,
which
is
labeled
transcript
of
record,
which
contains
almost
none
of
the
immigration
proceedings,
but
does
contain
the
proceedings
before
the
district
court.
the
briefs
on
both
sides
were
written
on
the
basis
of
this
printed
record
alone
and
references
were
made
to
the
unprinted
immigration
file,
which
is
on
file
with
the
clerk.
after
the
briefs
were
written,
the
supplemental
transcript
of
record
was
printed
at
the
instance
of
the
petitioner.
i
say
this
because
the
court
will
not
find
a
correspondence
between
the
page
references
in
the
briefs
to
the
immigration
file
and
this
printed
record.
though
i
think
the
clerk
has
been
helpful
in
putting
folio
references
to
help
you
discover
the
various
pages.
i
think
i
should
also
point
out
though,
mr.
peterson,
adverted
to
it
at
the
end
of
his
argument
that
this
is
the
second
go
round
in
this
case.
petitioner
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
and
declaratory
relief
originally
which
was
denied
by
judge
solomon
in
oregon
after
the
denial
of
suspension
of
deportation
and
after
the
finding
of
deportability.
that
was
taken
to
the
ninth
circuit
which
affirmed.
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
on
this
court.
this
court
held
that
petition
for
certiorari
until
one
week
after
the
rowoldt
decision
and
then
denied
that
petition
for
certiorari
along
with
two
or
three
others
which
were
being
held
pending
rowoldt.
the
petitioner
then
applied,
as
has
been
indicated
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
for
reconsideration
on
the
basis
of
the
rowoldt
decision.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
did
reconsider
on
the
basis
of
the
rowoldt
decision,
reaffirmed
its
own
original
determination.
petitioner
then
brought
the
present
suit
in
the
district
court
in
oregon
and
it
is
that
which
is
here.
now,
on
that
present
suit,
the
petitioner
asked
for
leave
to
proceed
with
oral
evidence
before
the
district
court
in
oregon
and
judge
solomon
thought
that
that
was
improper
as
did
the
government
believe,
but
he
allowed
the
petitioner
to
present
evidence
including
the
petitioner's
own
evidence
before
the
court.
after
that
hearing
at
which
judge
solomon
said,
“i
do
not
believe
the
petitioner.
i've
been
through
the
immigration
file.
i
do
not
believe
this
petitioner
has
testified
before
me.
i
do
believe
as
did
the
administrative
officials
that
the
opposing
evidence
presented
before
the
administrative
tribunal
was
credible.”
judge
solomon
reaffirmed
his
--
his
conclusion
that
the
petitioner
was
the
deportable
and
that
conclusion
was
affirmed
again
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
case
is
now
here
on
this
petition
for
certiorari.
therefore,
if
i
may
summarize,
the
case
has
had
three
reviews
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
it
had
its
first
review
after
the
original
order
of
deportation.
it
had
its
second
review
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
after
the
denial
suspension
of
deportation
and
it
had
its
third
review
after
the
rowoldt
decision.
it
has
had
two
reviews
before
the
district
court
in
oregon,
as
i
indicated,
and
it
has
two
--
had
two
reviews
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
i
say
this
because
this
court
has
indicated
perhaps
mainly
in
other
cases
but
also,
i
think,
somewhat
in
immigration
cases
that
it
will
pay
attention
to
--
on
a
fair
assessment
of
the
record
made
by
the
lower
courts
in
this
field
as
well
as
in
others.
and
it
will
not
review
de
novo
for
itself
on
assessment
of
the
record
made
by
lower
courts.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
first
one
did
not
entail
any
oral
evidence.
the
first
one
did
not,
but
it
was
a
review
on
the
administrative
record.
the
second
one
did
entail
oral
evidence
and
before
him.
now,
turning
first
to
the
statutory
and
factual
issues,
it
has
been
claimed
here
after
the
briefs
were
filed
and
so,
we
do
not
discuss
it
in
our
brief,
it's
claimed
here
on
oral
argument
that
the
standard
of
deportability
for
a
long
time
resident
is
different
from
the
ordinary
standard
which
is
applicable
in
civil
proceedings
generally,
that
it
is
the
higher
standard
applicable
in
criminal
proceedings
or
in
denaturalization
or
expatriation
cases.
we,
of
course,
denied
that
this
is
so
and
we
denied
that
is
so
because
it
is
now
some
70
years
since
congress
has
been
passing
broad
deportation
statutes.
and
it
is
70
years
since
congress
has
dealt
with
the
subject
and
since
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
have
dealt
with
this
subject.
and
we
cannot
find
in
any
of
this
--
this
legislation
or
in
any
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
or
the
lower
courts
any
such
distinction
between
on
--
with
respect
to
deportability
on
the
basis
of
the
length
of
residence
of
the
--
of
the
individual
or
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
deportation
is
related
to
original
entry
or
whether
it
arises
from
some
cause
which
later
occurred.
there
are
hosted
decisions
in
the
lower
courts
and
a
fair
number
of
decisions
in
this
court,
all
of
which
apply
the
usual
role
of
substantial
evidence
without
exception.
in
fact
in
some
them
cases
--
cases
written
by
justice
brandeis
and
justice
stone,
the
phrase
has
given
some
evidence
to
support
the
deportation.
and
in
bridges
against
wixon
to
which
reference
was
made,
mr.
justice
douglas
for
the
court
also
used
that
phrase
some
evidence.
and
the
court
has
never
even
intimated
nor
have
any
of
the
lower
courts
that
a
higher
standard,
the
standard
of
denaturalization
should
apply
in
deportation
cases
nor
has
congress
in
any
of
the
statutes
made
any
exemption.
you
will
not
find
in
this
statute
which
is
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
or
in
any
of
the
preceding
statutes,
any
distinction
such
as
has
been
suggested
at
the
bar
of
this
court.
so,
i
think
--
i
think,
i
fairly
stated
when
i
say
that
until
very
recently
and
not
until
probably
today
before
this
court
has
it
been
seriously
urged
that
there
is
a
separate
standard
for
deportations
of
people
who
have
been
long
resident
in
this
country.
now,
an
effort
is
made
to
say
that
the
prior
rule
was
changed
by
the
1952
mccarran-walter
act
because
the
1952
statute
did
spell
out
for
the
first
time
various
procedural
requirements
which
should
be
followed
in
the
administrative
proceeding.
it
said
that
the
attorney
general
shall
prescribe
by
regulation
and
certain
requirements
shall
be
followed
and
one
of
the
requirements
that
was
prescribed
by
the
statute
was
that
the
--
an
order
of
deportation
should
be
entered
only
on
substantial,
probative,
and
reasonable
evidence,
substantial,
probative
and
reasonable
evidence.
an
effort
is
made
to
read
into
that
language,
a
requirement
of
the
higher
standard
to
which
counsel
has
referred.
we
think
that
this
is
clearly
an
incorrect
argument.
not
only
was
the
prior
law
both
in
the
statute
and
in
the
cases
all
the
other
way,
but
congressmen
(inaudible)
to
prepare
the
1952
statute
when
the
senate
committee
set
forth
what
it
considered,
the
prior
law
to
be,
it
said
explicitly
that
the
prior
law
was
the
general
rule
applicable
in
administrative
and
civil
cases,
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard,
the
substantial
evidence
standard.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
of
any
attempt
to
change
that
standard.
the
senate
and
the
house
reports
referred
to
the
--
this
--
this
phrase
substantial,
probative,
and
reasonable
evidence
as
simply
an
incorporation
of
the
--
of
the
prior
law
and
they
indicate
fairly
that
it
means
that
a
reviewing
tribunal
is
not
to
overturn
the
finding
simply
because
it
disagrees
with
it,
but
if
--
if
the
finding
is
based
on
substantial,
probative,
and
reasonable
evidence.
but
perhaps
most
persuasive
of
all,
to
my
mind,
is
the
fact
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
which,
of
course,
antedated
the
1952
statute
contains
the
similar
standard.
it
says,
“reliable,
probative
and
substantial
evidence”.
and
this
court
in
the
marcello
opinion
of
mr.
justice
clark
for
that
court
said
quite
clearly
and
explicitly,
that
the
1952
immigration
standard
is
the
same
as
the
administrative
procedure
act
standard
of
few
prior
years.
and
of
course,
there
has
never
been
any
claim
by
anybody
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
standard
adopts
any
special
higher
standard
for
administrative
proceeding
as
generally.
now,
the
standard
which
--
which
counsel
present
to
that
court
clear,
convincing,
and
unequivocal
evidence
has
been
accepted
and
limited
by
the
court
only
to
cases
in
which
it
has
--
it
has
admitted
that
a
man
or
woman
once
had
citizenship
and
the
government
claims
that
he
has
lost
it.
it
is
--
been
limited
to
that.
that
is
when
the
government
is
claiming
when
a
man
is
either
lost
or
should
have
his
citizenship
taken
away
and
it
is
in
that
area
only
that
that
court
has
accepted
or
established
a
clear,
convincing,
and
unequivocal
standard.
in
particular
that
court
has
not
accepted
that
standard
where
an
alien
claims
that
he's
a
citizen,
where
an
alien
claims,
“i
am
a
citizen”.
the
court
has
accepted
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
there.
it
is
only
when
you
have
once
been
found
to
be
a
citizen,
when
you've
once
been
found
to
be
a
citizen
and
the
issue
is
whether
you
have
lost
that
citizenship
or
have
it
--
had
it
taken
away
from
you
that
the
higher
standard
has
been
applied
either
by
this
court
or
by
the
lower
courts.
so,
we
think
that
that
there
is
nothing
to
the
argument
that
--
that
that
1952
statute
established
a
higher
standard
and
i
think,
it's
correct
to
say
that
none
of
the
lower
courts
since
the
1952
act
went
into
effect
have
applied
any
higher
standard
regardless
of
the
length
of
time
where
the
resident
was
here.
and
as
my
last
word
on
that
issue,
i
think,
i
should
also
say
that
the
court
has
applied
the
regular
standard
in
many
cases
in
which
there
was
a
long
time
residence
by
the
person.
it
itself
is
not
indicated
either
in
the
chinese
deportation
cases
which
some
which
involved
people
who
have
been
here,
a
decade
or
two
decades
or
in
the
later
cases
involving
deportation
which
have
come
through
the
years
that
there
was
any
difference
depending
on
length
of
residence.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
lower
courts
have
been
explicit.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
this
court
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
that
in
--
where
the
issue
is
an
issue
of
citizenship
preponderance
to
the
evidence
is
enough.
both
ways,
mr.
justice,
either
when
the
government
wins
and
the
court
holds
that
the
--
that
the
man
was
an
alien
and
not
a
citizen
or
where
the
court
holds
that
the
man
was
a
citizen.
both
ways
it's
been
held
by
the
lower
courts
that
the
preponderance
was
enough.
now
as
to
the
--
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
which
in
my
view,
have
only
been
stated
partially
by
counsel
for
petitioner.
first,
i
should
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
record
does
show
that
the
petitioner
is
a
high
school
graduate
and
from
portland
high
school.
i
should
also
explain
that
the
petitioner
has
gone
in
this
country
under
the
name
mackie
m.a.c.k.i.e.
so
you
will
find
in
both
the
judicial
and
the
administrative
record,
constant
references
to
mackie
rather
than
to
the
name
niukkanen
under
which
--
which
is
his
finish
name
under
which
the
petition
was
filed
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
i
just
say
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
because
you
will
find
references
constantly
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mackie
is
the
petitioner.
he
has
gone
under
the
name
of
william
mackie.
and
as
--
mr.
justice
clark,
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
he
applied
for
naturalization
first
in
1935.
the
record
doesn't
show
what
happened
to
that.
he
apparently
tried
again
because
the
record
does
indicate
that
for
the
second
or
third
time
he
applied
in
january
1942
and
then
it
does
indicate
that
in
--
in
1946
his
application
for
denaturalization
was
dismissed
for
wanted
of
prosecution
on
his
part.
so
that's
all
that
the
record
here
--
the
immigration
followed
the
judicial
record
indicates
as
to
his
--
his
applications
for
naturalization.
now
as
has
been
indicated
by
counsel,
two
live
witnesses
appeared
before
the
special
inquiry
officer
and
they
were
examined
and
extensively
cross-examined
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
their
testimony
was
credited
by
the
special
inquiry
officer
and
on
the
whole
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
judge
solomon
on
review
says
explicitly
in
the
record
that
i
have
read
the
record
and
i
credit
the
testimony
of
bob
wilmot
and
knight
and
i
do
not
credit
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
either
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
or
before
me.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
is
mr.
wilmot
that
he
said
he
never
seen.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
it's
in
the
--
in
the
regular
transcript
of
the
testimony,
page
78
at
the
bottom,
mr.
justice
harlan.
and
again
at
page
83
at
the
top
78
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
and
83.
now,
what
did
these
witnesses
testified
to?
they
testified
that
the
petitioner
has
attended
many
close
party
meetings?
knight
himself
said
there
were
30
to
35
that
he
intended
with
the
petitioner.
and
they
were
very
definite
that
these
were
not
any
ordinary
meeting
that
they
were
closed
party
meetings.
wilmot
also
testified
that
there
were
closed
party
meetings
that
he
attended
to
with
petitioner.
both
of
them
saw
that
he
had
party
card.
both
of
them
testified
that
he
had
a
communist
party
card.
both
testified
that
they
saw
him
pay
dues.
knight
testified
that
though
petitioner
was
not
an
officer
of
the
albina
branch,
albina
is
a
section
of
portland
and
the
branch
of
the
communist
party
to
which
both
he
and
knight
joined
was
the
albina
branch,
that
though
he
was
not
an
officer,
he
was
on
the
executive
board
of
the
branch
and
this
is
an
important
factor
which
mr.
forer
failed
to
mention.
wilmot
testified
that
he
and
the
petitioner
attended
a
party
plenum
p.l.e.n.u.m.
in
aberdeen,
washington
which
was
to
be
a
meeting
of
top
officials
or
top
persons
in
the
party
for
the
northwest
area,
that
both
he
and
petitioner
attended
this
plenum
at
aberdeen,
washington.
he
testified
that
the
people
went
there
such
as
petitioner
and
he
were
the
anointed
ones,
were
the
top
fraction
ones,
that
they
were
known
to
the
people
who
are
carrying
on
this
--
this
meeting.
both
knight
and
wilmot
indicated
that
the
petitioner
was
a
top
fraction
man.
he
was
a
good
member
as
i
have
said,
that
he
was
an
anointed
one.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it's
the
word
used
in
communist
party
parliament.
so
it's
a
meaning
a
gathering,
wider
than
a
small
--
a
unit
gathering
or
a
large.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
and
there
--
they
were
cross-examined
as
--
as
to
this
by
petitioner's
counsel
and
they
explained
perhaps
more
footing
on
cross
examination
and
they
did
on
direct
exactly
what
went
on
at
--
at
this
plenum
meeting.
it's
also,
i
think,
significant
and
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
wilmot
testified
that
petitioner
knew
where
he
was
going
just
as
wilmot
who,
of
course,
was
party
member
himself.
both
wilmot
and
knight
were
party
--
had
been
party
members
at
--
were
at
the
time
in
question.
now,
it
has
also
been
indicated,
petitioner
refused
to
--
though
warned
refused
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
at
the
original
deportation
hearing.
he
did
also
only
after
the
board
and
immigration
appeals
had
decided
that
he
was
deportable
and
he
then
applied
for
--
for
suspension
of
deportation
and
on
that
suspension,
he
testified.
now,
as
the
court
knows
from
previous
cases,
suspension
of
deportation
of
a
man
who
was
been
ordered
deported
for
membership
in
the
communist
party
requires
an
affirmative
recommendation
by
the
attorney
general
to
converse
and
then
an
affirmative
concurrent
resolution
by
both
houses
of
congress
before
suspension
of
deportation
can
be
allowed.
and
the
statute
also
requires
that
to
be
eligible
for
suspension,
you
have
to
show
that
for
10
years
after
the
status
or
act
which
made
you
deportable
occurred,
you
have
been
a
person
of
good
moral
character
and
so
forth.
now,
this
has
been
interpreted
by
the
department
of
justice
and
by
the
congress
to
require
in
cases
of
suspension
for
subversive
activity
cases
that
the
alien
show
that
for
10
years
he
has
made
a
break
from
the
communist
party
that
he
has
not
been
connected
with
it
that
he
has
been
free
of
it
that
he
is
antagonistic
to
it,
that
he
is
not
part
of
it.
and
it
was
in
connection
with
that
that
petitioner
testified.
and
he's
--
he
denied
that
he
had
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
denied
that
he
--
that
he
had
known
or
seen
wilmot
at
all.
his
testimony
as
to
knight
was
that
yes,
he
knew
him.
he
knew
him
but
he
couldn't
--
he
didn't
know
whether
knight
was
a
party
official
or
a
party
member.
he
couldn't
tell.
petitioner's
testimony
with
respect
to
his
--
his
views
on
communism
appear
really
twice
in
the
record
one
in
the
--
in
the
immigration
file
at
pages
45
to
48,
and
the
other
in
the
--
in
the
judicial
trial
before
judge
solomon,
on
56,
and
61,
and
62.
what
they
amount
to
is
a
denial
--
a
complete
denial
of
membership
in
the
communist
party,
except
that
he
said
he
never
knowingly
attended
party
meetings.
he
apparently
indicated
that
he
had
attended
lots
of
meetings
during
this
period
of
time
and
he
--
his
--
his
statement
was
that
he
hadn't
knowingly
attended
communist
party
meetings.
he
refused
when
requested
to
state
his
views
of
what
communism
was
today.
he
said
well
he
couldn't
go
into
that,
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
really
know
what
was
all
about
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
his
--
of
his
statements
as
to
--
as
to
the
communist
party
in
his
views
that
he
was
denied
suspension
of
deportation.
because
as
i've
indicated,
the
principal
has
been
that
you
aren't
granted
suspension
of
deportation
unless
you
have
indicated
affirmatively
that
you
have
made
a
break
from
the
communist
party.
and
the
conclusion
of
the
administrative
officials
was
that
he
had
not
at
all
shown
that
he
made
a
break
from
the
communist
party
that
he
had
not
indicated
any
--
shall
i
say
dissatisfaction
with
the
communist
party
though
he
had
denied
that
he
was
ever
a
member.
and
as
i've
pointed
out,
the
district
judge,
judge
solomon,
who
was
corporal
part,
may
i
note
was
the
local
counsel
for
de
jonge
in
the
case
of
de
jonge
against
oregon,
judge
solomon
said
although
he
indicated
his
--
his
dissatisfaction
with
the
law
as
--
as
--
as
a
proper
law,
he
said
that
he
had
to
enforce
it.
and
he
felt
that
in
this
case
he
was
properly
enforced
against
this
petitioner
that
--
and
he
disbelieved
the
petitioner's
denial
of
communist
party
membership
and
he
said
my
credit
with
--
what
the
government's
witnesses
said.
now,
you
have
then
a
testimony
of
live
witnesses,
cross-examined
witnesses,
credited
by
the
administrative
officials
and
by
the
district
court
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
twice.
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
the
petitioner's
testimony
character
--
discredited
by
the
administrative
officials
characterized
as
vague,
evasive,
unresponsive,
discredited
by
the
trial
judge
who
did
hearing.
and
in
those
circumstances,
we
feel,
that
as
the
court
has
indicated
in
the
past
this
is
not
its
providence
to
reassess
or
reweigh
the
evidence.
it
will
accept
the
views
of
the
--
of
the
courts
below
and
the
administrative
officials.
now,
was
the
membership
which
i
have
been
describing,
the
type
of
membership
which
is
covered
by
the
deportation
provisions
of
the
1952
statute?
we
think
clearly
that
it
was
--
that
it
was
the
kind
of
meaningful
political
membership
with
which
the
court
was
dealing
in
galvan,
in
harisiades,
and
in
rowoldt.
he
was
cart
(inaudible),
he
was
dues
paying.
he
attended
many
close
meetings.
he
was
a
top
fraction,
a
person
who
attended
this
northwest
plenum
in
aberdeen,
washington.
he
was
very
active
and
i
think
i
fairly
state
that
they
both
testified
that
though
they
couldn't
recall
any
theoretical
discussions
with
him
on
the
principles
of
marxist-leninist
--
marxism-leninism,
he
was
very
active
in
discussion
of
party
activities
in
the
portland
area.
both
knight
testified
that
and
wilmot
testified
that
he
was
active
in
discussion
with
the
party
activities
in
that
area.
he
was
a
member
of
the
executive
board
of
his
party
branch.
both
knight
and
wilmot
testified
though
they
testified
they
had
never
heard
him
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
they
did
testify
that
the
--
they
--
that
all
the
activities
of
the
party
which
they
knew
about
it
and
which
he
was
connected
with
were
leading
to
an
eventual
revolt,
and
wilmot
testified
that
petitioner
as
wilmot
knew
where
he
was
going.
the
court
has
indicated
that
it
is
permissible
for
administrative
officials
to
draw
inferences
from
silence
and
inferences
for
failures
to
explain.
if
you
put
that
together
with
the
testimony,
credited
testimony
of
these
witnesses
and
the
type
of
activity
which
has
been
shown
that
this
petitioner
engaged
in,
we
think
he
falls
clearly
within
the
--
the
rules
laid
down.
he
was
not
a
minor.
there
are
certain
exceptions
which
have
been
read
by
statute
and
initial
decision
into
the
concept
of
the
term
membership.
he
was
not
a
communist
by
operation
of
law
which
of
course
could
not
occur
in
the
united
states
and
unlike
rowoldt,
there
is
no
indication
that
he
was
communist
to
obtain
the
necessities
of
life.
rowoldt
was
a
man
who
was
deported
solely
on
the
basis
of
his
own
testimony
which
that
majority
of
the
court
thought
was
not
clear
enough
to
indicate
that
he
had
any
political
connection
with
the
communist
party,
that
he
wasn't
a
member
of
the
communist
party
as
he
said
to
--
for
--
for
bread
and
food,
this
is
a
different
type
of
man.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
he
worked
intermittently
but
he
was
unemployed
the
part
of
that
time
and
part
of
the
time
he
was
employed,
yes.
but
there
is
no
indication
that
he
joined
the
communist
party
in
the
sense
that
it
was
the
way,
that
he
was
going
to
get
food
for
himself.
he
joined
the
communist
party
because
he
thought
the
communist
party
was
going
to
lead
to
a
type
of
society
that
--
that
--
he
--
he
wanted
and
in
that
broader
sense.
he
--
he
was
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
is
no
evidence.
i
mean
he
--
it's
said
there
is
evidence
that
he
was
interested
in
--
in
the
--
that
the
government's
witnesses
were
asked,
and
said,
“yes,
he
was
interested
in
the
activities
of
the
parties
so
as
to
obtain
more
relief
and
food
and
so
on
for
the
people
at
that
time”
and
that
he
was
active
in
those
things
and
it's
on
basis
of
that
that
i
infer
that
that
he
was
interested
in
those
activities,
there
is
testimony
to
that
effect.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
there
was
with
relation
to
the
newspaper
that
is
he
was
trying
to
sell
the
newspaper
which
--
which
was
a
c.i.o.
newspaper
with
wilmot
the
editor
said
was
being
run
by
a
communist
party
unit
that
the
organization
of
the
newspaper
in
that
particular
area
in
portland
was
a
communist
party
unit.
aside
from
the
generalities
that
i've
indicated,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
indication
of
the
particular
kind
of
activities
that
he
was
--
that
petitioner
was
engage
in.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
he
was
--
he
--
he
would
come
in
and
take
the
newspaper
and
--
and
go
out
and
sell
the
newspaper.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
a
very
few
--
few
cents
or
something
but
i
think,
it
was
not
done
for
money
purposes,
i
think,
it
was
done
because
he
believed
the
newspaper
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
evidence
shows
that
he
didn't
get
very
much
from
the
newspaper.
the
evidence
does
show
that
--
that
the
wilmot
testified
that
he
got
2
or
3
cents
or
some
other
thing
like
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me!
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
it
would
--
i
should
make
clear
that
this
was
the
c.i.o.
newspaper
this
was
before
the
afl-cio
in
1936
to
1939.
the
c.i.o.
newspaper
which
the
editor
of
the
newspaper,
wilmot
testified
was
really
a
communist
party
organization.
he
was
a
communist
and
all
the
people
working
for
it
were
communists
and
that
they
were
--
it
was
uses
as
a
communist
party
organ
in
that
evidence.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
page
9
of
the
supplementary
record,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
nine
and
10.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
was
he
said
but
of
course
he
want
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
his
testimony
was
that
he
was
interested
in
political
matters,
yes.
i
should
also
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
there's
a
great
deal
of
more
testimony
by
him
on
other
aspects
of
the
suspension
application.
what
has
been
reprinted
here
is
only
the
testimony
relating
to
what
questions
asked
about
the
communist
party.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
yes
of
course.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
is
no
specific
testimony
if
he
using
the
word
political
but
the
testimony
is
that
he
was
interested
in
the
activities
of
the
party
in
that
area
and
this
was
of
course
the
communist
party.
it
was
not
a
front
organization.
it
was
the
communist
party
as
such
in
which
he
had
a
party
card.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
didn't
say.
it
was
just
said
the
activities
whatever
the
party
was
carrying
on
in
that
area
and
justice
--
other
parties
carrying
on
activities
and
we
know
judicially
that
the
communist
party
has
at
least
in
until
very
recent,
it
carried
on
a
number
of
activities
of
different
types
under
the
rule
brick
of
the
communist
party
which
were
party
activities
in
the
same
sense
that
other
parties
carry
on
activities
which
have
oblique
political
consequences
so
they
may
immediately
have
other
purposes
as
well.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
he
said
he
knew
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
he
did.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
yes
he
did.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
i
should
[attempt
to
laughter]
it
maybe
proper
for
me
to
say
that
point
that
judge
solomon's
interpretation
was
that
knight
--
that
knight
tried
to
be
as
easy
on
--
on
petitioner
is
possible
and
own
it's
our
cross
examination
that
the
most
damaging
testimony
against
petitioner
was
brought
as
far
as
knight
is
concerned.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
he
said
that
page
70,
he
didn't
--
i
should
make
it
clear
that
he
--
knight
did
not
testify
before
judge
solomon
but
judge
solomon
said,
that
he
had
read
and
reread
the
testimony,
the
administrative
testimony,
there's
one
part
of
the
record
where
he
says,
“i
stayed
up
to
1
o'clock
this
morning
rereading
the
entire
transcript,”
in
this
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
at
the
earlier
time,
yes.
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
he
said
i
believe
the
testimony
above
wilmot,
this
is
on
page
78,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
believe
the
testimony
of
knight
and
i
do
not
believe
mr.
mackie's
testimony,
i
believe
that
he
purges
himself
before
and
i
believe
that
he
purges
himself
today
because
i
think
the
evidence
is
clear
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
during
the
period
in
which
it
was
said
that
he
was
a
member.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
that
would
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
knight
was
asked
whether
he
ever
committed
felony
and
he
first
denied
it.
it
then
turned
out
that
he
had
been
convicted
in
california
for
forgery
which
probably
was
a
felony.
he
then
explained
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
well,
he
then
explained
that
it
was
a
$25
check
many,
many
years
ago
and
that
he
had
not
thought
that
it
was
felony
because
it's
so
small
in
amount
and
that
he
had
not
wanted
to
admit
it
was
a
felony
because
the
effect
on
his
children.
but
it
--
that
of
course
was
brought
out
in
the
--
in
the
hearing
and
taken
account
of
both
by
the
special
inquiry
officer
board
immigration
appeals
and
of
course,
it
was
before
the
courts
below.
it's
not
a
new
factor
that
is
come
into
the
case.
it
was
there
all
along.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
that's
right.
and
i
shall
try
to
explain
in
a
minute
or
two
left,
further
reasons
and
after
lunch,
why
we
think
congress
clearly
wanted
this
kind
of
person
to
be
--
to
be
deported.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
question
about
that,
but
i
think
that
the
court
has
to
accept
the
facts.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
in
deciding
whether
petitioner
is
the
type
of
party
member
who
was
deportable
under
the
1952
provisions
of
the
immigration
act,
i
think
we
and
the
court
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
was
not
a
new
statute.
that
it
was
a
combination
of
the
statutes
which
had
began
in
1917
and
that
was
a
long
history
of
--
of
judicial
and
administrative
interpretation
of
that
statute
and
that
this
court
itself
has
passed
upon
that
issue
in
various
cases.
going
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
harisiades
case,
that
case
involved
three
different
people,
harisiades,
a
mrs.
coleman
and
the
mr.
mascitti.
the
record
of
relationship
to
mrs.
coleman
which
is
summarized
by
justice
jackson
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
and
which
is
of
course
more
fully
set
forth
in
the
--
in
the
record
before
the
court
indicates
that
she
was
a
rank
and
file
member
with
far
less
if
you
want
to
call
it
activity
than
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
when
you
get
to
the
galvan
case,
he
had
no
more
activity,
no
more
what
you
might
call
awareness
of
the
theoretical
underpinnings
of
the
communist
party
than
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
fact
is,
that
the
statute
and
its
predecessors
have
not
been
interpreted
judicially
and
certainly
not
by
congress
nor
administratively
from
1917
on
to
require
any
knowledge
of
what
you
might
call
communist
party
theory,
marxism-leninism.
this
deportation
statute
of
course
is
what
i'm
talking
about.
rather,
congress
has
been
--
has
been
trying
to
deport
people
who
were
party
members
in
the
ordinary
sense
who
were
active
in
the
party
and
the
day
to
day
work
of
the
party
who
were
the
doers
of
the
party
as
were
whether
they
were
theoreticians
or
not.
galvan
was
not
a
theoretician,
mrs.
coleman
and
mascitti
in
the
harisiades
cases
were
not
the
theoreticians.
mrs.
coleman
didn't
purported
not
even
to
know
who
joseph
stalin
was.
“he
is
a
russian”,
she
said.
“is
he
a
russian?”
and
the
answered
to
the
question,
“do
you
who
joseph
stalin
is?”
the
important
thing
as
far
as
congress
has
been
concerned,
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
why
is
that
person,
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
as
distinguished
from
some
other
organization.
and
was
he
or
she
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
the
ordinary
sense
in
which
somebody
is
a
member
of
the
party,
knowing
that
it
is
a
party
and
that
of
course,
we
believe
is
what
--
what
petitioner
did
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
hard
for
me
to
know
all
the
figures
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
between
1920
and
1950
there
were
200
we
know
that.
i've
only
gotten
the
figures
for
the
last
three
years
for
the
years
1955
to
1959,
the
fiscal
years,
42
were
deported.
they
are
now
pending
246
cases
administratively
and
16
are
in
the
courts,
so
that
42
were
actually
deported.
the
court
had
in
the
nestor
case
at
the
last
session
case
of
a
man
who
was
actually
deported,
there
were
42
actually
deported
in
the
years
1955
to
1959.
there
are
now
pending
246
administrative
cases
and
16
cases
in
the
courts.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
prior
to
the
time
this
act,
yes.
yes,
that's
what
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
to
figure
--
the
200
figures
were
not
that.
the
200
figures
include
both
the
200
from
1920
to
1950
include
both
present
members
and
past
members.
that
those
figures
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
42
or
--
have
--
were
actually
deported
in
the
fiscal
years
1955
to
1959.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
not
exactly
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
as
you
know
that
until
kessler
against
strecker
was
decided
in
1939,
the
service
believed
that
the
statute
applied
to
past
people
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
past
time
as
party
membership.
the
200
includes
both
those
who
were
determined
to
have
been
members
in
the
past
and
those
who
were
determined
to
be
members
at
the
time
the
deportation
proceeding
was
instituted.
that
200
from
1920
to
1950
includes
both
categories
but
the
later
category
that
i
gave
afterwards
includes
only
members
who
were
in
the
past.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
which
figure
are
you
giving
mr.
justice?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
200
--
200
includes
both.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
also
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
and
i
have
no
breakdown
on
it.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
42
are
people
who
have
been
actually
deported
in
the
four
past
fiscal
years,
1955
to
1959
for
past
membership
in
the
communist
party.
that
is
precisely
the
same
as
this
petitioner.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
246
are
pending
administratively.
and
16
are
in
various
courts.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
if
--
if
i
would
have
a
chance
to
reargue
the
constitutional
question
i
would
of
course
say
that
that
is
the
function
as
this
court
has
said
of
congress
and
not
of
the
court.
but
the
court
as
i
said
in
the
harisiades
and
the
galvan
case
as
well
as
the
lower
courts
have
indicated
that
the
type
the
--
the
membership
of
this
--
the
type
of
membership
which
this
petitioner
had
was
sufficient
for
--
for
purposes
of
the
act
and
the
lower
courts
have
construed
the
statute
both
before
the
rowoldt
case
an
after
the
rowoldt
case.
in
our
brief,
we
refer
to
several
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
after
the
rowoldt
decision.
and
if
the
court
will
read
the
opinions
of
those
cases
they
will
see
that
the
type
of
that
activity
which
those
aliens
engaged
in
was
no
different
in
substance
or
in
some
cases
it
was
little
more
--
there
was
some
case
that
was
greater
in
point
and
some
cases
are
less
in
point
than
they
--
than
this
--
this
petitioner
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
distinction
i
made
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
in
the
rowoldt
case
where
the
court
had
only
rowoldt's
own
statements
before
them
and
nothing
else;
that
it
was
not
satisfied
that
rowoldt
joined
the
communist
party
has
a
party,
as
a
political
party.
it
wasn't
satisfied
that
he
hasn't
joined
it
--
that
he
didn't
join
it
solely
for
--
for
--
to
gain
his
own
livelihood,
as
if
he
were
a
--
a
method
of
obtaining
a
necessities
of
life.
now,
that
was
not
true
of
galvan
and
it
is
not
true
of
this
petitioner
here.
this
petitioner
was
an
active
party
member.
he
was
a
--
a
member
of
the
executive
board
of
his
branch
--
of
the
executive
board
of
his
branch,
he
went
to
this
plenum
in
--
in
aberdeen,
washington
and
on
page
12
of
the
supplemental
record,
the
witness
wilmot
testifies
went
on
at
the
plenum
in
summary.
and
what
went
on
was
a
discussion
of
the
activities
of
the
communist
party
particularly
he
say
--
he
said,
“in
relation
to
promoting
the
party
in
the
lumber
industry.”
in
other
words,
they
were
carrying
on
the
activities
which
the
communist
party
was
carrying
on
as
a
party
in
that
region
at
that
time.
to
us
it
makes
no
difference
whether
petitioner
here
was
a
theoretician
or
understood
marxism-leninism.
congress
wanted
to
get
those
who
were
the
supporters,
the
doers,
the
--
the
active
helpers
as
well
as
those
who
were
might
call
the
party
theoreticians.
in
fact,
when
congress
passed
the
statute
in
1940,
which
overruled
kessler
against
strecker
it
didn't
overrule,
it
changed
the
law
which
had
been
laid
down
in
kessler
against
strecker.
as
the
court
will
remember
kessler
and
strecker,
the
court
held
that
until
they
said,
mr.
justice
roberts
for
the
court
said,
‘unless
we
are
given
a
more
specific
indication
by
congress,
we
will
not
hold
that
a
man
who
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
no
matter
how
far
in
the
past
or
for
how
shorter
time
will
be
portable
under
the
statute
and
may
held
that
the
statute
related
only
to
present
the
membership
in
the
party.”
in
1940,
congress
changed
that
and
the
--
and
the
committee
reports
are
explicit.
they
say
in
obvious
reference
to
the
language
of
the
kessler
against
strecker
opinion
that
a
person
is
deportable
for
no
matter
how
for
membership,
for
no
matter
how
shorter
time
or
how
far
in
the
past
so
long
as
it
was
after
the
date
of
entry.
no
matter
how
far
in
the
past
or
how
short
the
time
and
in
the
harisiades
case,
the
court
have
reported
three
aliens
one
of
whom
left
the
party
in
1929
and
the
other
two
in
1939.
i
might
say
that
the
leaving
of
the
party
in
1939
may
have
some
other
significance,
we
don't
know
because
as
the
court
pointed
out
on
the
harisiades
case,
the
communist
party
at
that
time
gave
instructions
after
kessler
against
strecker
had
been
decided,
that
all
aliens
were
to
leave
the
party
so
they
would
no
longer
be
subject
to
deportation.
and
there
been
a
large
number
of
cases
involving
leaving
the
party
in
1939.
i
think
more
cases
involved
that
one
year
than
any
year
that
i'm
familiar
with
and
of
course,
this
petitioner
left
the
party
according
to
the
record
in
1939.
as
i've
indicated,
it
makes
no
difference
how
shorter
time
under
a
congressional
mandate
the
man
was
a
member
of
the
party.
and
of
course,
as
the
court
has
twice
held
upon
the
harisiades
and
galvan
and
i
think
quite
correctly
under
the
history
and
stretcher
statute,
it
doesn't
require
any
knowledge
by
the
alien
of
the
unlawful
or
objectives
of
the
communist
party
that
advocates
the
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
congress
has
been
so
insistent
upon
the
deportation
of
present
and
past
members
of
the
communist
party
that
in
1950,
it
refused
to
apply
the
suspension
provisions
to
persons
in
this
category
at
all.
they
were
not
suspendable
at
all.
in
1952,
in
one
of
the
perhaps
few
alleviating
portions
of
the
mccarran-walter
act
suspension
was
granted
to
people
in
this
category.
but
congress
retained
for
itself
the
final
say
and
it
required
a
10-year
period
of
good
conduct
before
it
took
a
man
to
even
be
eligible
to
deportation.
what
i
mean
by
that
is
this;
congress
provided
with
respect
to
certain
types
of
deportable
aliens.
that
if
the
attorney
general
certified
that
the
man
was
--
should
be
--
should
have
his
deportation
suspended
that
went
into
effect
unless
one
house
of
congress
affirmatively
acted
contrary
to
it.
and
in
some
cases,
and
most
to
those
cases
they
provided
only
for
a
five-year
period
of
good
conduct
to
just
doing
of
the
act
which
require
the
deportation.
but
with
regard
to
the
so-called
‘subversive
aliens“
including
past
members
of
the
communist
party,
it
required
a
10
year
period
of
good
conduct
and
provided
that
there
should
be
no
suspension
of
deportation
unless
both
houses
of
congress
affirmatively
vote
to
suspend
the
deportation
otherwise,
the
statute
says,
the
attorney
general
shall
deport
the
alien.
so,
congress
has
been
strict.
it
has
been
very
severe
and
it
has
reserved
to
itself
the
alleviating,
the
merciful
power.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
justice,
but
i
can
get
them
if
--
if
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
don't
have
those.
of
course,
as
was
pointed
out,
the
question
of
suspension
is
not
here
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
because
it
was
not
raised
in
its
present
litigation.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
there
have
been
some
but
i
--
i
really
cannot
say
whether
they've
been
many
or
not.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
i
--i
will
try
it
again.
now
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
petitioner
lacks
his
own
to
a
suggestion
inaccurately
stated
i
think
by
petitioner's
counsel
which
the
government
made
in
a
totally
different
area
in
the
smith
act
criminal
prosecutions
relating
to
criminal
prosecution
for
knowing
membership
in
the
communist
party.
that
of
course
is
a
totally
different
statute
subject
to
different
constitutional
restrictions
with
the
totally
different
background.
i
would
not
think
that
--
that
in
the
light
this
--
the
history
of
this
statute
going
back
as
i
say,
at
least
till
1920,
well
documented
is
the
court
has
indicated
on
the
harisiades
and
in
the
galvan
cases
that
there
would
be
any
possibility
of
carrying
over
into
this
statute
which
after
all
is
about
the
latest
modification
of
a
whole
series,
a
position
applicable
to
a
new
statute
never
before
judicially
or
not
as
far
as
the
membership
clause
is
concerned,
never
before
judicially
construed
by
this
court
and
resting
on
an
entirely
different
constitutional
basis.
in
any
case,
i
would
say
that
i
venture
the
judgment
that
the
standard
which
the
government
gave
in
the
scale
case
would
be
met
by
this
petitioner
who
was
active,
who
was
active
in
the
party
discussions
and
i
won't
repeat
the
all
the
things
that
i've
said,
he
was
an
active
party
member,
he
was
not
a
merely
normal
member.
he
was
not
an
unconscious
or
an
artificial
or
accidental
party
member.
if
i
might
take
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
he
were
a
regular
member
who
attended
close
meetings
every
week
as
this
man
did,
and
who
participated
in
general
discussions
of
the
communist
party
program
in
the
city
of
portland,
i
would
not
make
a
distinction
that
the
only
--
the
only
particular
activities
that
he
personally
participated
in
might
be
only
of
--
of
some
kind
of
economic
program.
on
the
other
hand,
if
that
was
all
that
he
did,
if
he
was
not
a
regular
member,
this
man
was
a
regular,
weekly
attending
meeting
perhaps
even
more
than
weekly,
we
don't
know
that
because
the
record
isn't
explicit,
but
we
do
know
that
he
attended
party
meetings
weekly.
we
do
know
that
he
--
he
did
go
to
this
meeting
in
aberdeen
and
that
i
--
i
would
like
to
qualify
the
answer
i
gave
to
you
before
lunch,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
refer
to
the
statement
of
what
went
on
at
the
plenum
in
aberdeen
because
there
it
does
indicate
more
explicitly
what
kind
of
activities
they
carried
on
and
one
of
them
was
relations
promoting
the
party
in
the
lumbering
industry.
now,
we
know
that
what
the
communist
party
did
then
and
what
probably
is
doing
now
is
an
effort
to
infiltrate
into
various
activities,
economic,
industrial
activities
in
order
to
promote
its
program.
and
as
the
witness
said
here,
this
being
a
lumbering
state,
most
of
our
activities
were
directed
at
that
industry
in
that
meeting
and
though
record
isn't
explicit
as
to
--
to
what
this
man
did
with
respect
to
that,
he
was
participating
in
this
meeting
which
was
just
set
before
the
program
and
we
think
that's
sufficient.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
membership
this
man
had
in
the
party
was
no
different
perhaps
stronger
than
that
of
the
galvan
case.
there
was
no
showing
that
galvan
have
participated
in
subversive
activities.
there
was
no
showing
that
mrs.
coleman
or
michitti
in
the
--
of
two
or
three
in
the
harisiades
case
participated
in
subversive
activities.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
of
--of
a
particular
little
unit.
and
this
--
this
man
is
a
--
was
a
member
of
the
executive
board
of
the
same
type
of
unit
and
more
than
that,
he
was
a
top
fraction
member
who
attended
the
--
this
plenum
that
i've
been
describing.
but
there
was
--
there
this,
in
most
of
these
cases
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
11
and
16
of
the
supplemental
record.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
word
--
the
word
top
fraction
is
actually
used
on
page
16.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
16.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
this
is
wilmot.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
you
are
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
first
is
on
13.
this
is
still
the
witness
wilmot
about
the
middle
of
the
page
and
we're
still
talking
about
this
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
may
i
make
the
point
clear
if
you
want
to
know
that
these
are
the
anointed
people,
when
i
show
up
there,
mr.
mackie,
they
knew
who
we
were.
then
is
it
your
contention
of
mr.
mackie
wasn't
an
ordinary
communist,
but
that
he
was
one
the
big
wheels,
is
that
correct?
he
belonged
to
what
we
called
“the
top
fraction”.
question,
“he
is
one
of
the
top
fraction
in
the
communist
party?
answer,
“with
the
exception
of
what
related
to
the
waterfront
activity”
and
it's
repeated
on
page
16.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
there's
no
evidence
that
he
made
a
speech.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
there
is
evidence
that
he
discussed,
there
is.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
what?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh!
except
for
the
--
except
for
the
discussion
with
relation
to
aberdeen
that
is
at
the
plenum
which
is
on
page
12
there
is
no
specific
reference
to
what
he
discussed
except
to
test
party
activities
in
that
area.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
it
--
it
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
on
page
8
in
the
middle.
did
you
ever
--
did
you
ever
attend
any
meetings
communist
party
outside
the
city
of
portland
which
mr.
mackie
attended.
he
attended
one
in
aberdeen.
what
kind
of
a
meeting
was
this?
it
was
they
called
the
plenum.
it
was
merely
the
port
work
that
was
carried
on,
plenum
are
fullness
literally,
it
was
the
port
work
that
was
carried
on
by
people
in
the
northwest
and
then,
there
is
further
discussion
on
pages
12
and
13
of
what
this
plenum
and
14
of
what
this
plenum
was
about
and
who
attended
it.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
but
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
it
not.
i
would
say
that
it
is
in
the
government's
briefs
in
--
in
the
harisiades
and
galvan,
and
rowoldt
cases.
on
the
reargument
in
rowoldt,
we
reprinted
a
compilation
of
our
briefs
in
harisiades
and
galvan.
so,
i
think
that
from
our
point
of
view,
an
appropriate
history
is
in
this
--
in
our
supplemental
brief
for
the
respondent
on
reargument
in
the
rowoldt
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
it's
also
contained
in
--
in
large
part
in
--
in
that
opinion
of
mr.
justice
jackson
in
harisiades
and
in
your
opinion
to
the
court
in
the
galvan
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
yes.
i
think
--
i
think
that
it's
both
accurate
and
authority.
on
the
--
on
the
issue
of
--
of
constitutionality
the
court
of
course,
knows
that
the
issue
has
been
here
with
respect
to
this
statute
twice
before,
once
in
harisiades
case
which
involve
the
statute
which
different
in
only
one
particular.
it
was
precisely
the
same
as
this
except
that
the
statute
there
did
not
refer
names
of
the
communist
party
but
only
to
the
--
to
an
organization
advocating
to
overthrow
the
government
and
that
proof
had
been
introduced
on
that
subject,
and
it
was
not
contested
but
in
all
other
respects,
the
past
membership,
the
type
of
membership
and
so
forth,
the
--
the
case
was
precisely
the
same.
in
the
carlson
case
carlson
against
landon,
decided
the
same
day
on
march
1952
as
the
harisiades
case,
the
court
upheld
the
statute,
this
statute,
the
one
naming
the
communist
party
with
relation
to
present
membership
in
the
communist
party.
that
case
involved
present
membership
and
the
court
upheld
the
statute
with
relation
to
present
membership
in
the
communist
party.
in
--
in
the
galvan
case,
in
1954,
the
court
upheld
this
statute
with
relation
to
past
membership
in
the
communist
party.
in
the
rowoldt
case,
the
majority
of
the
court
do
not
reach
it,
the
dissenters
reaffirmed
the
validity
of
the
statute
as
there
applied.
in
the
bonetti
case,
though
case
went
off
on
a
--
on
a
non-constitutional
on
a
statutory
ground,
there
is
a
statement
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
if
bonetti
had
been
a
member
of
the
party
after
entry,
he
would
have
been
deportable
under
galvan
against
press
decision.
five
petitions
have
been
filed
since
the
rowoldt,
five
petitions
for
certiorari
have
been
filed
in
this
court,
raising
a
constitutional
issue
since
rowoldt
and
they
have
all
been
denied
and
that
does
include
the
present
case.
it
does
include
the
prior
petition
on
behalf
niukkanen.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
perhaps
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
the
only
issue
that
i
really
have
time
to
discuss
again,
i
think,
the
only
one
that
perhaps
needs
in
this
discussion
is
the
issue
of
bill
of
attainder.
i
think,
it
is
important
to
point
out
to
the
court,
two
cases
in
which
it
was
claimed
that
a
congressional
deportation
act
was
a
bill
of
attainder
or
free
cases.
the
first
one
was
the
chinese
--
the
first
chinese
exclusion
case
which
was
upheld
in
130
u.s.
in
the
chinese
exclusion
case,
chae
chan
pan.
the
briefs
in
that
case
indicate
that
a
strong
argument
was
made
that
that
statute
was
a
bill
of
attainder.
in
the
fong
yue
ting
case,
which
involved
none
exclusion
of
chinese
but
deportation,
the
brief
both
of
the
eminent
lawyers
joseph.
h.
choate
and
maxwell
evarts
and
mr.
hubley
ashton
both
raised
the
issue
of
bill
of
attainder
which
was
rejected
by
the
court
on
the
ground
which
it
has
followed
ever
since
--
ever
since
the
deportation
is
not
punishment
and
--
and
therefore,
the
bill
of
attainder
does
not
apply.
it
was
raised
in
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
it
were
punishment,
i
think
not.
because,
i
think
a
bill
of
--
of
attainder
relates
to
punishment
for
past
conduct
by
congress
and
i
think
that
this
is
not
punishment
for
past
conduct,
but
a
decision
by
congress
that
this
type
of
person
is
not
someone
whom
the
country
wants
to
--
to
maintain.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
that
as
far
as
--
as
sending
him
out
of
the
country
is
concerned
classes
which
congress
can
determine
for
sending
out
that
he
does
not
have
the
right
to
invoke
as
is
has
been
authoritavely
determined
the
due
process
clause,
the
bill
of
attainder
clause,
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
an
alien
in
the
country
is
not
barred
with
respect
to
the
procedure
in
determining
his
deportability
or
in
respect
to
his
life
while
he
still
remains
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
that
is
been
held
in
the
wong
wing
case
one
of
the
early
chinese
cases
where
they
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
that
they
could
not
--
they
could
not
--
that
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
you
said
they
could
not
and
i
said
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
it's
been
held
in
wong
wing.
where
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
i
don't
think
they
do
--
could.
but
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
but
the
court
has
consistently
maintained
for
70
years
that
with
respect
to
the
--
to
consistently,
on
many
occasions
with
the
respect
to
the
classification
of
what
type
of
alien
shall
be
sent
out
of
the
country
and
deported
that
is
the
matter
for
congress.
it's
been
replied
to
people
on
racial
ground,
chinese.
it
is
been
applied
to
people
in
offensive
other
that
through
sickness
people
who
could
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
justice,
this
court
does
not
said
that
they
can
do
it
without
any
procedures,
or
that
they
--
all
that
i'm
talking
about
here
is
about
what's
involved
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
was
a
--
a
special
kind
of
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
but
in
certain
cases
they
could
do.
they
--
they
hadn't
said
that
all
aliens
can
be
deported
without
any
procedure.
i'm
talking
only
about
the
one
issue,
which
is
the
only
issue
here
there
was
nor
procedural
issue
here.
no
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
but
there's
no
issue
as
to
the
procedure
in
the
--
in
the
deportation
process.
no
constitutional
issue
about
the
procedure
and
--
in
the
deportation
process.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
yes,
yes.
excepting
that
mr.
justice,
i
--
i
meant
yet
that
there
is
no
claim
that
--
the
trial
here,
the
hearing
here
was
on
favor.
they
do
raised
the
issue
of
bill
of
attainder.
i
think,
it
is
been
rejected
by
the
court
at
the
beginning
of
the
great
series
of
cases
on
deportation
legislation.
it
was
reject
to
--
i
think
with
relation
to
this
particular
statute
in
the
galvan
case
where
it
was
argued
and
--
and
briefed.
and
we
think
that
the
whole
course
of
history
goes
against
it,
because
the
court
has
consistently
said,
until
the
--
this
very
day
that
deportation
is
not
punishment
and
the
bill
of
attainder
requires
much
more.
