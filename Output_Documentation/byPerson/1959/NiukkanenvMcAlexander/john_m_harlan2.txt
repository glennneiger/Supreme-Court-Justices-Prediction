justice
john
m.
harlan
was
he
told
at
the
original
hearing
an
inference
will
be
taken
from
his
failure
to
take
the
stand?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
--
does
this
case
bring
up
here
a
question
relating
to
the
propriety
of
denial
of
suspension
of
the
deportation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps
this
is
irrelevant
or
collateral,
but
did
the
service
give
any
reason
for
declining
to
suspend
deportation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that
to
be
that
we
found
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
word
plenum
a
word
of
ours,
i
never
heard
that
before?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
people
have
been
deported
under
this
statute
overall,
do
you
know?
