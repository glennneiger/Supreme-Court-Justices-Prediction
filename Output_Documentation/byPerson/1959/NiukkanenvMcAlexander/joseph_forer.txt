mr.
joseph
forer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
from
the
ninth
circuit.
it
challenges
the
validity
of
a
deportation
order
that
was
entered
against
the
petitioner
based
on
a
finding
that
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
from
1937
to
1939.
the
petitioner
was
born
in
finland
in
1908.
in
1909,
when
he
was
9
months
old,
he
entered
this
country
and
was
admitted
as
an
immigrant.
he
has
lived
in
the
united
states
ever
since.
he
is
married
to
a
native-born
citizen
of
the
united
states.
he
has
citizen
step
son.
his
aged
parents
live
here
as
do
both
his
sisters.
in
1950,
11
years
after
the
period
of
alleged
communist
party
membership
in
this
case,
congress
for
the
first
time
enacted
in
the
internal
security
act,
a
requirement
that
all
aliens
who
had
been
members
of
the
communist
party
at
anytime
after
entry
must
be
expelled
from
the
country.
in
1952,
deportation
proceedings
were
started
against
the
petitioner
under
this
provision.
two
witnesses
testified
that
he
had
been
member
of
the
communist
party
in
the
period
of
1937
and
1939.
he
did
not
testify
and
a
deportation
order
was
issued.
the
deportation
proceeding
was
then
reopened
in
order
to
allow
the
petitioner
to
apply
for
suspension
of
deportation
as
had
become
possible
by
reason
of
the
enactment
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
now
at
the
reopened
hearing,
petitioner
did
testify
and
at
the
reopened
hearing,
he
testified
for
the
first
time
that
he
had
never
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
he
explained
his
failure
to
testify
to
that
fact
originally
at
the
original
hearing,
by
saying
in
effect
that
he
figured
that
the
original
hearing
that
he
did
not
have
a
chance
when
he
saw
that
the
service
had
produced
two
witnesses
to
testify
contrary
to
the
fact
and
particularly
when
one
of
the
witnesses
was
a
person
who
had
never
seen
him
in
his
life.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
was.
he
was,
but
as
i
say
at
the
reopened
hearing,
he
testified.
now
the
--
mr.
joseph
forer
it
was
reopened
for
the
purpose
of
discretionary
relief,
but
nevertheless,
he
testified
on
the
subject
of
deportability
which
incidentally
was
also
apparently
considered
relevant
on
discretionary
relief.
and
the
special
inquiry
officer
who
presided
at
the
reopened
hearing
chose
to
believe
the
services
witnesses
and
disbelieved
the
petitioner
and
he
repeated
his
finding
of
deportability.
he
also
denied
suspension.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
affirmed.
following
that
came
this
court's
decision
in
rowoldt
against
perfetto
and
the
petitioner
moved
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
as
he
could
under
the
regulations
to
have
the
deportation
case
reopened
and
reconsidered
in
the
light
of
the
rowoldt
decision.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
denied
the
motion
and
refused
to
reopen
the
proceeding
on
the
ground
that
they
were
satisfied
with
the
evidence
in
the
light
of
rowoldt
and
that
the
evidence
satisfied
the
rowoldt
decision.
then
this
litigation
followed.
mr.
joseph
forer
there
was
argument
whether
or
not
there
would
be
for
the
board,
there
was
an
application
which
the
brief
did
somewhat,
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
there
was
both
an
oral
presentation.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
i
beg
your
pardon.
i'm
–
i'm
wrong.
what
was
submitted
was
a
motion
which
was
an
argumentative
motion
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
did
not
just
issue
an
order
denying
the
motion,
but
reviewed
the
facts
and
–
and
the
evidence
and
held
that
rowoldt
was
not
applicable.
mr.
joseph
forer
before
–
the
opinion
of
the
bia
denying
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
that
is
in
the
supplemental
transcript
of
the
record,
it's
the
last
bia
opinion
in
that
volume.
mr.
joseph
forer
well
the
supplemental
transcript
of
the
record
which
contains
all
the
relevant
excerpts
from
the
immigration
proceedings
and
at
page
61
of
the
supplemental
transcript
is
this
board
--
board's
opinion.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
there's
a
transcript
of
the
record
known
as
the
separate
supplemental
transcript
of
the
record
which
was
printed
late.
now,
the
first
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
deportation
order
is
justified
by
the
evidence
in
the
light
of
the
rowoldt
case.
now,
in
rowoldt,
this
court
held
in
effect
that
the
statute
requiring
the
expulsion
of
aliens
who
had
been
members
of
the
communist
party
did
not
include
every
member
of
the
party
in
an
organizational
sense
even
though
like
rowoldt,
the
individual
had
actually
joined
the
party
and
been
accepted
by
it
as
a
member
and
the
court
limited
the
term
“member”
for
the
purpose
of
the
deportation
statute
to
a
person
who
had
what
the
court
described
as
a
meaningful
association
with
the
party
and
whose
affiliation
had
what
the
court
described
as
political
implication.
now
in
the
present
case
the
evidence
regarding
membership
and
the
nature
of
the
membership
can
be
summarized,
i
think,
as
follows.
the
petitioner
as
i
have
said
denied
membership
of
any
kind.
the
service
witness
knight
however
testified
that
he
and
the
petitioner
had
been
members
of
the
same
party
unit
from
1937
to
1939.
and
knight
testified
that
during
this
time,
the
petitioner
attended
about
30
to
35
party
meetings
and
then
he
paid
him
25
cents
a
month.
he
said
that
petitioner
had
been
on
the
executive
committee
or
executive
board
of
the
unit
but
he
did
not
say
for
how
long
or
what
the
petitioner
did
if
anything
in
that
capacity.
he
did
say
that,
the
petitioner
had
never
been
an
officer
of
the
party.
he
also
testified
that
the
petitioner
was
not
interested
or
knowledgeable
in
communist
theory
or
political
discussions
but
said
he
was
interested
in
the
discussions
of
“bread
and
butter”
and
welfare
topics.
and
it
is
clear
both
from
knight's
testimony
and
from
the
petitioner's
testimony
that
the
petitioner
was
and
he
is
thoroughly
ignorant
of
communist
party
doctrine
and
literature.
now,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
expressed
doubt
about
knight's
credibility,
but
it
found
that
his
testimony
was
corroborated
by
the
second
service
witness,
a
man
by
the
name
of
wilmot.
wilmot
was
in
a
different
class
than
either
the
petitioner
or
knight,
both
of
them
were
working
men,
wilmot
was
intellectual.
in
the
critical
period
he
was
the
editor
of
an
official
c.i.o.
newspaper
which
he
testified
was
controlled
by
members
of
the
communist
party
including
himself.
now,
wilmot
did
not
claim
like
knight,
wilmot
did
not
claim
to
be
a
member
of
the
same
communist
party
unit
or
section
as
the
petitioner
but
he
testified
that
as
editor
of
this
paper
and
as
a
communist
he
would
get
around
to
various
communist
party
sections
and
he
testified
that
he
saw
the
petitioner
at
some
close
party
meetings
and
that
he
once
saw
the
petitioner
pay
dues.
he
also
testified
that
the
petitioner
would
come
to
the
office
of
the
c.i.o.
newspaper
which
although,
it
was
the
c.i.o
newspaper,
he
sort
of
callused
with
also
being
a
communist
organ,
said
petitioner
would
come
to
the
office
of
the
newspaper
once
or
twice
a
month
to
get
copies
for
circulation
purposes.
and
that
on
sometimes
on
those
visits,
he
would
sit
in
on
discussions
held
by
communists
who
were
on
the
staff
of
the
paper
and
wilmot
quotes
these
discussions,
“close
the
party
meetings”.
wilmot
said
that
he
considered
that
petitioner
was
in
what
he
called
“the
top
fraction
of
the
party”.
now,
i
don't
--
he
didn't
say
what
he
meant
by
“top
fraction”
but
if
he
meant
anything
significant,
i
think,
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
this
bit
of
testimony
about
“top
fraction”
which
was
relied
on
heavily
below
and
it's
relied
on
heavily
by
the
government
was
a
wholly
unsupported
and
unreliable
piece
of
sheer
opinion
testimony
which
furthermore,
is
inconsistent
with
the
testimony
of
knight
who
was
in
a
better
position
to
know
the
facts.
i
may
say
that
when
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
of
the
court
below,
they
constantly
emphasize
the
evidence
against
the
petitioner
and
either
slur
over
or
ignore
the
evidence
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
had
never
seen
wilmot
in
his
life
before
the
hearing
and
that
wilmot
had
never
seen
him.
now,
i
think
that
a
fair
assessment
of
the
government's
evidence
assuming
that
one
disbelieves
the
petitioner
is
not
more
than
that
the
petitioner
had
been
organizationally
a
member
of
the
communist
party
that
he
attended
meetings,
that
he
paid
dues
of
25
cents
a
month,
that
he
was
ignorant
of
and
not
interested
in
communist
theory
and
literature
but
he
was
interested
in
discussions
of
“bread
and
butter”
matter.
now,
this
evidence
it
seems
to
me,
falls
far
short
of
the
evidence
about
rowoldt
whom
this
court
held
was
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
for
the
purposes
of
a
deportation
statute.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
recall
that.
he
was
an
ordinary
working
man.
he
is
a
house
painter.
now,
i
believe
--
i
--
i
believe
that
it
is
in
the
record
he
went
through
high
school.
rowoldt
joined
the
party.
rowoldt
was
accepted
by
the
party.
rowoldt
paid
dues
and
rowoldt
attended
the
meetings
and
that's
the
most
if
you
can
say
about
the
petitioner
here,
but
in
addition,
rowoldt
had
intellectual
and
political
sophistication
that
this
petitioner
doesn't
have.
and
unlike
this
petitioner,
rowoldt
had
read
communist
literature,
he
knew
its
language,
he
was
interested
in
its
view
of
society
and
there
to
some
extent
insofar
as
he
understood
the
pack
and
he
agreed
with
it
and
moreover
rowoldt
carried
out
in
assignment
from
the
communist
party.
he
ran
a
party
book
shop.
now,
the
government
distinguishes
rowoldt
on
the
ground
that
in
rowoldt,
rowoldt
himself
described
the
nature
of
his
membership.
now,
the
petitioner
didn't
do
that
here
because
he
--
instead
of
describing
the
membership
he
denied
it,
but
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
--
if
what
is
important
is
the
nature
of
the
evidence
then
what
is
important
is
what
the
evidence
shows
or
fails
to
show
about
the
nature
of
the
membership
and
not
who
the
evidence
and
not
whom
the
evidence
came
from.
now,
actually,
it
seems
to
me,
in
order
to
sustain
this
deportation
order
consistently
with
rowoldt,
you
have
to
take
the
position
and
it's
the
position
that
has
been
taken
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
if
not
in
this
case,
as
i
think,
they
had
taken
this
case,
in
numerous
cases.
you
had
to
take
the
position
that
initially
the
obligation
of
the
service
is
merely
to
prove
organizational
membership
in
the
communist
party.
once
the
service
does
that
then
the
burden
is
on
the
alien
to
give
a
convincing
explanation
that
his
membership
was
not
sufficiently
political,
not
sufficiently
meaningful
so
as
to
bring
him
under
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
rowoldt
case.
and
on
this
theory
if
the
alien
does
not
give
an
adequate
explanation
of
the
nature
of
his
membership
and
on
credited
denial
it's
obviously
not
an
explanation
then
the
service
can
infer
meaningful
membership
that
is
deportable
membership
from
nothing
more
that
evidence
of
organizational
membership
or
nondeportable
membership
and
that's
really,
what
i
think,
this
case
comes
down
to
and
i
think,
that
that
position
is
rowoldt.
the
service
has
the
burden
under
the
statute
of
proving
that
any
alien
against
whom
it
proceeds
for
expulsion
purposes
is
in
a
deportable
class.
now,
that
means
that
it
must
prove,
in
terms
of
the
communist
party
class,
not
nearly
that
the
alien
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
some
commonly
accepted
sense
but
that
he
was
a
member
within
the
sense
of
the
statute
that
they
don't
prove
the
latter,
they
are
not
entitled
to
deduce
it
solely
from
the
former
because
that
is
shifting
the
burden
approved
to
the
alien
and
they
have
no
right
to
do
that.
mr.
joseph
forer
unfortunately
does
was
not
the
one
of
the
question
presented.
the
denial
of
suspension
was
not
ready
sir.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
i
mean
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
the
whole
immigration
record
is
--
is
filed
with
clerk's
office,
certified
record.
it
covers
everything,
including
the
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
he
also
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
from
him,
yes.
well,
he
also
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
except
that
he
also
testified
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
and
that
testimony
is
--
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
printed
in
the
transcript,
original
transcript
of
the
record,
yes,
and
you
can
draw
inferences
from
that
as
to
his
intellectual
sophistication.
well,
i
was
talking
about
the
burden
of
poof.
as
i
said,
the
burden
approved
is
on
the
service
to
prove
this
meaningful
membership
and
in
rowoldt,
it
seems
to
me,
clear
that
the
court
put
on
the
service,
the
burden
of
proving
from
the
solidity
of
proof
that
the
membership
was
of
the
sufficiently
meaningful
kind.
now,
this
case
also
turns,
i
think,
not
only
on
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
but
on
what's
standard
of
proof
you
use
in
assessing
the
evidence.
now,
ordinarily
in
expulsion
cases,
the
service
decides
according
to
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
which
is
the
general
standard
of
course
in
civil
cases
and
it
is
our
view
that
there
is
a
certain
class
of
expulsion
cases,
which
i
will
define
in
a
moment,
in
which
there
should
be
required
a
higher
standard
of
proof
through
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
that's
the
standard
that
this
court
erected
in
the
denaturalization
cases
and
then
transfer
to
the
expatriation
cases,
namely
a
standard
requiring,
clear,
convincing
and
unequivocal
evidence
which
does
not
leave
the
issue
in
doubt
and
if
that
standard
were
applied
to
this
case
it
would
have
to
be
concluded,
i
think,
that
the
burden
of
proving
that
petitioner
is
deportable
was
not
carried
not
only
under
the
rowoldt
but
even
as
to
whether
petitioner
was
ever
any
kind
of
a
member
of
a
communist
party.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
i
haven't,
i
think,
that
in
effect
that
was
the
test
applied
in
bridges
against
wixon,
but
it
has
never
been
articulated,
it
has
not.
now,
i
want
now,
to
describe
the
two
classes
of
expellable
aliens
as
to
one
of
which,
i
think,
you
should
have
--
erect
a
higher
a
standard
of
proof,
then
i
will
explain
why
we
think
that
is
so,
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
clauses
for
expulsion
of
aliens
as
they
are
collected
for
instance
in
section
241
of
the
current
immigration
nationality
act,
you
can
already
see
right
from
the
face
of
them
that
they
fall
into
two
--
two
classes.
the
clauses
in
the
first
class
can
be
described
as
a
kind
of
deferred
exclusion
because
on
their
face,
their
purpose
is
to
aid
the
screening
of
arriving
aliens
and
basically
they
require
the
expulsion
of
aliens
who
are
in
this
country
for
clauses
which
existed
at
the
time
of
entry
and
they
deal
with
aliens
who
either
were
not
admitted
for
permanent
residents
in
the
first
place
or
would
not
have
been
admitted
for
permanent
residence
in
the
first
place
if
at
the
time
of
entry
all
pertinent
facts
were
known.
and
if
i
might
give
examples
of
this,
you
have
the
aliens
who
are
expellable
because
they
entered
without
inspection
or
because
although
they
were
admitted,
they
were
in
fact
for
reasons
that
no
one
knew
about
excludable
by
law
at
the
time
of
entry
or
they
are
paid
entry
papers
by
fraud
or
they
became
institutionalized
or
public
charges
within
five
years
after
entry,
but
for
reasons
which
appear
at
the
attributable
to
the
conditions
which
existed
at
the
time
of
entry
or
they
entered
for
a
limited
time
or
purpose
and
overstayed
their
leave.
now,
the
great
majority
of
deportations
and
i'm
not
talking
about
exclusions,
i'm
talking
about
expulsions,
the
great
majority
of
expulsions
are
for
such
clauses
and
they
involve
people,
for
the
most
part,
who
have
not
had
long
residence
in
this
country
and
who
were
not
entitled
to
act
on
any
assumption
that
they
have
been
accepted
for
permanent
residence.
now
the
second
class
of
expellable
aliens
consist
of
those
who
were
lawfully
and
regularly
admitted
for
permanent
residence
as
to
whom
there
was
no
mistake
on
admitting
them,
who
made
their
homes
here
in
reliance
on
their
screening
and
acceptance
by
the
government,
but
who
then
become
expellable
solely
for
conduct
which
occurred
after
entry
and
which
cannot
be
trudged
to
or
derive
from
conditions
existing
at
the
time
of
entry.
now,
these
expulsions
comprise
only
about
one-sixth
of
the
total
deportation
or
total
expulsions
which
occur
in
the
40-year
period
from
1908
to
1948
and
these
aliens
fall
into
four
major
groupings.
the
majority
of
them,
the
great
bulk
of
them,
are
aliens
convicted
of
certain
crimes
who
are
deportable
for
that.
then
there's
another
group,
aliens
who
become
narcotic
addicts.
then
there's
a
third
group,
aliens
who
become
prostitutes
or
go
into
the
business
of
prostitution
and
finally
what
they
called
the
“subversive
aliens,”
the
aliens
who
become
expellable
on
communist
or
anarchist
grounds
or
something
that
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
there
is
none.
mr.
joseph
forer
there
is
--
mr.
joseph
forer
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
forer
that
is
correct
and
that
certainly
includes
that.
now,
these
aliens
in
the
second
class,
that
is
who
were
regularly
admitted
frequently
even
normally,
to
have
long-term
residents
here
and
in
reliance
on
their
having
been
admitted
and
accepted
for
this
country,
they've
acquired
families
here,
they
have
acquired
property
here,
their
roots
are
here.
from
a
sociological
point
of
view
they're
americans.
the
petitioner
here
is
not
fin,
he's
an
american.
no
matter
what
technically,
he
can
be
called
in
the
law
of
nation.
furthermore,
the
post
entry
conduct
that
makes
these
aliens
considered
undesirable
for
continued
residency
here
comes
from
our
society.
it
doesn't
come
from
the
country
of
origin.
it
was
america
that
made
this
petitioner
a
communist.
it
wasn't
finland
which
he
left
when
he
was
nine
months
old.
and
then
these
cases
too,
the
evidence
characteristically
goes
back
for
years
the
events
long
remote
in
time
and
to
events
frequently,
which
when
they
occurred,
were
not
grounds
for
deportation.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
what
--
mr.
joseph
forer
he
became
a
communist,
it
seems
to
me
in
rebellion
against
the
society
we
had
in
america
not
in
rebellion
against
the
society
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
know
why
anybody
else
becomes
a
communist.
in
other
words,
his
testimony
denied
he
hadn't
been
a
communist.
mr.
joseph
forer
well
--
well,
i'm
not
sure
if
i
can
answer
[attempt
to
laughter]
it
satisfactory
but
that's
how
it
seemed
to
me.
when
these
aliens
in
the
second
class
are
expelled,
they're
not
being
sent
back
to
their
--
the
land
they
come
from
in
the
sense
of
aid
of
exclusion.
they're
being
banished
from
what
is
really
their
home
and
they're
being
sent
back
is
not
a
regulation
of
immigration.
it's
not
a
regulation
of
the
immigration
here
with
finland.
they're
being
sent
back
because
congress
decided
it
didn't
like
the
particular
kind
of
conduct
they
engaged
in.
now
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
says,
“that
deportation
orders,
in
order
to
be
valid,
have
to
be
supported
by
reasonable,
substantial,
and
probative
evidence.”
now,
i
say
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
have
a
preponderance
of
evidence
test
for
the
expulsion
of
the
first
class
of
aliens.
those
who
--
whose
expulsion
is
basically
a
deferred
explosion,
and
they
are
not
being
deprived
of
any
lawful
established
states,
but
a
second,
a
higher
standard
of
proof
is
reasonable
for
the
second
class
of
aliens,
those
that
are
being
banished.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
but
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
as
soon
as
they
are
caught.
mr.
joseph
forer
that
is
correct,
but
normally,
it
is
not
--
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
joseph
forer
it
is
possible.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
you
can
get
them
from
some
of
the
--
from
the
--
i
believe,
the
report
of
the
president's
commission
and
there
are
numerous
other
sources,
including
the
reports
of
the
immigration
services.
now,
in
the
denaturalization
cases,
you
erected
a
higher
standard
of
proofd
than
in
the
ordinary
civil
case
because
of
the
harshness
of
uprooting
a
person
from
the
society
of
which
he
is
a
part.
and
also
because,
i
think,
you
realize
that
denaturalization
cases,
since
they
are
not
subject
to
any
statute
of
limitations,
frequently
involved
long
past
occurrences
and
stale
evidence.
mr.
joseph
forer
it's
very
obscure.
he
applied
for
citizenship
papers
and
it
dragged
on
for
years
and
--
then
they
--
they
didn't
grant
it
then
they
wrote
him
saying
that
they
were
throwing
his
application
out
because
of
the
failure
of
prosecution.
that's
all
the
record
shows.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
know
the
date
of
hand.
now,
these
same
features
that
he
is
being
uprooted
from
his
society
and
that
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
and
--
and
he's
being
uprooted
because
of
long
past
recurrence,
these
same
features
which
induce
you
to
adopt
a
higher
standard
of
proof
in
denaturalization
cases
are
present
and
consistently
present
in
the
second
kind
of
expulsion
cases,
the
real
banishment
cases.
and
for
the
same
reasons
you
should
adopt
the
higher
standard
of
proof.
and
in
fact,
the
higher
standard
of
proof
is
more
necessary
in
the
expulsion
cases
because
at
least
in
the
denaturalization
cases,
the
individual
is
guaranteed
a
judicial
trial
and
in
the
expulsion
cases
he
is
guaranteed
only
an
administrative
hearing.
mr.
joseph
forer
because
of
great
citizenship.
mr.
joseph
forer
this
man
is
not
a
citizen.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
know.
i
know
there
is
a
big
difference
but
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
the
consequences
here
are
very
similar.
i
mean,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
consequences
here
is
even
harsher
and
the
--
aside
from
the
fact
that
one
is
technically
a
citizen
and
the
other
isn't,
you
are
doing
the
same
thing
to
the
individual.
mr.
joseph
forer
i'm
not
saying
it's
a
technicality,
but
i
am
saying,
what
you're
doing
to
him
justifies
him,
i
think
it
requires
the
higher
standard
of
proof.
and
i
think,
that
that
was
really
--
that
degree
of
standard
of
proof
was
applied
by
this
court
in
bridges
against
wixon.
and
in
jordan
against
de
george
you
carried
over
a
criminal
test,
a
test
of
criminal
statute,
to
deportation,
to
expulsion
precisely
for
the
same
reason.
and
it
would
not
be
unreasonable
therefore
to
carry
over
what
amounts
to
a
proof
beyond
unreasonable
doubt.
i
would
like
to,
in
my
part
of
the
argument,
just
say
a
one
word
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
“member
of
the
communist
party
in
the
deportation
statute”.
now
i
think
both
the
government
and
we
agree
that
it
would
be
good
if
there
could
be
a
more
specific
definition
of
that
term
than
is
supplied
in
the
rowoldt
case.
fortunately,
such
a
definition
or
more
specific
definition
has
been
proposed
by
the
solicitor
general.
he
hasn't
proposed
it
in
this
case.
he
hasn't
proposed
it
for
the
purposes
of
deportation
statute,
but
he
did
propose
it
in
the
scales
case
and
he
has
proposed
it
in
the
scales
case
for
the
purpose
of
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act.
and
this
meaning
was
given
to
the
jury
in
scales'
the
second
trial
at
the
request
of
the
government.
now,
the
theory
of
the
definition
is
that
the
solicitor
general
advanced
in
scales,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
communist
party
is
such
a
special
kind
of
organization
that
it
has
two
kinds
of
members.
one
are
the
real
members,
the
active
people,
the
people
that
really
contribute
to
the
purposes,
the
sinister
purposes
attributed
to
the
party,
it
says,
“they
are
the
people
that
congress
really
has
in
mind,
the
stereotype
of
communist
party
members
in
anti-communist
legislation.
then
there
are
a
lot
of
other
members
or
at
least
some
other
members
who
are
unofficial
members.
they
think
their
members
but
they're
not
members
in
the
sense
that
congress
had
in
mind
and
they
are
not
the
active
members
and
the
solicitor
general's
definition
of
between
the
active
member
and
the
nonactive
member
and
he
helps
us,
what
he
calls
–
he
defines
active
member.
and
the
suggestion
he
made
on
defining
active
member
for
the
purposes
of
the
smith
act
,which
i
suggest
you
translate
to
the
deportation
statute,
is
that
a
member
is
active
if
“he
might
know
--
that
he
is
one
who
“must
have
voted
all
or
a
substantial
part
of
his
time
and
efforts
to
the
party”.
now
if
that
definition
is
a
test,
obviously
it
wasn't
meant
here.
and
obviously,
it
seems
to
me,
that
this
test
of
activity
is
the
minimum
needed
to
make
any
sense
out
of
the
statute.
it
makes
no
sense,
i
think.
it
is
just
the
irrational
and
cruel
to
banish
a
person
from
the
land
where
he's
lived
all
his
life
except
for
the
first
nine
months
and
to
destroy
his
family
of
americans
for
what?
merely
for
attending
years
back
some
meetings
and
paying
25
cents
a
month
due
and
otherwise
being
inactive,
innocent
and
thoroughly
uninformed
member
of
the
communist
party
or
any
other
organization.
at
a
minimum,
and
this
minimum
would
be
supplied
by
the
solicitor
general's
activity
test,
at
a
minimum
you
should
require
that
there'd
be
a
showing
that
this
alleged
member
did
something
to
substantially
promote
the
organization
and
its
activities
beyond
just
belonging
to
it
in
a
routine
sort
of
way.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
they
did
and
i
think
it
is
quite
relevant
because
if
you
look
at
the
reasons
given
the
entire
time,
i
agree
to
--
to
the
court,
the
reasons
are,
first,
that
he
showed
reluctance
to
be
an
informer,
when
they
asked
him
who
attended
certain
meetings
of
the
oregon
committee
(inaudible).
and
their
theory,
it
seems
to
be,
that
the
only
people
that
are
reluctant
to
be
reformers
are
unreformed
communist,
and
secondly,
that
--
that
he
had
joined
the
methodist
federation
for
social
action
after
he
has
been
ordered,
deported,
and
that
he
didn't
--
and
that
he
didn't
think
very
much
of
the
immigration
nationality
act.
all
this
is
a
particularly
plain
in
the
opinion
of
the
special
inquiry
officer,
at
page,
beginning
at
page
54
of
the
supplemental
printed
record.
and
those
were
the
reasons
incidentally
that
they
considered
that
the
witness,
that
--
that
the
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
credence
in
denying
membership
in
the
communist
party.
mr.
peterson
will
continue
with
the
argument.
mr.
joseph
forer
if
the
court
please,
i
think,
mr.
davis's
version
of
the
facts
suffers
from
giving
an
unwarranted
and
wholly
sinister
interpretation
to
little
pieces
of
irrelevant
evidence
that
do
not
--
are
not
justified
in
bearing
such
an
interpretation,
if
i
may
give
one
or
two
illustrations.
mr.
davis
mentioned
as
a
great
significance
the
fact
that
wilmot
testified
that
--
that
this
alien,
the
petitioner
knew
where
he
was
going.
now,
if
you
look
at
page
15
of
the
supplemental
record,
you'll
see
the
testimony
on
that
and
this
is
on
cross
examination
of
wilmot
and
the
lawyer
asked
me,
“you
say,
you
knew
where
you
were
going,
do
you
think
either
mackie,
that's
the
petitioner,
knew
where
he
was
going?”
answer,
“i
think,
mr.
mackie
knew
where
he
was
going.”
question,
“you
just
assumed
that
because
you
know
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
is
that
right?”
answer,
“he
would
have
been
permitted
in
the
meetings.”
it's
perfectly
clear
that
by
wilmot
test
anybody
who
went
to
communist
party
meeting
knew
where
he
was
going.
mr.
joseph
forer
or
was
permitted
to
be
present
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
as
a
member
--
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
i'm
talking
about
close
meeting.
wilmot's
testimony
makes
perfectly
clear
that
he
thinks
that
anybody
who
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
ipso
facto
knows
where
he
is
going.
now,
i
don't
know
what
he
means
by
that,
but
whatever
significance
it
has,
it
has
no
more
significance
than
factual
testimony
that
the
man
was
present
at
meetings
of
the
communist
party.
now,
let's
look
at
where
he
says
about
the
top
fraction?
on
page
13,
question,
“then
it
is
your
contention
that
mr.
mackie
wasn't
an
ordinary
communist
but
that
he
was
one
of
the
big
wheels,
is
that
correct?”
answer,
“he
belonged
to
what
we
call
the
top
fraction.”
but
he
never
says,
leaving
aside
that
he
doesn't
say
what
he
means
by
the
top
fraction,
he
never
says
on
when
he
faced
the
opinion
that
he
belonged
to
the
top
fraction
and
the
--
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
he
wasn't
asked
that
question
on
cross
examination.
he
never
says
what
he
means
by
top
fraction.
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
but
if
your
read
over
his
testimony,
he
thinks
that
anybody
who
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
was
a
--
an
anointed
person
and
very
important.
now,
let's
go
back
to
page
15
on
the
question
of
the
paper,
and
he's
asked
whether
ever
had
any
discussion
with
mr.
mackie
and
the
only
discussion
he
remembers,
he
says,
“i
remember
about
the
paper
and
its
distribution.”
question
was
that,
“do
you
know
where
your
newspaper
office?
answer,
“yes.”
question,
do
you
--
question,
“do
you
remember
what
was
said
about
what's
done
in
that
particular
occasion?”
answer,
“well
it
had
to
do
largely
with
circulation.”
that
was
a
perfect
place
for
people
to
come
and
sit
and
i
don't
attribute
any
great
sinister
significance
to
that.
and
i
also
attribute
no
particular
significance
to
this
plenum
and
i'm
coming
to
that
in
a
moment
which
is
more
than
mackie
--
than
this
witness'
testimony
that
12
years
before,
somebody
--
it
saw
this
man
at
a
communist
party
meeting.
but
if
you
look
at
page
8,
where
he
mentions
the
plenum,
he's
asked,
whether
or
not
he
ever
attended
any
communist
party
meeting
outside
of
portland
that
mackie
attended?
and
he
says,
“yes,
one
in
aberdeen.”
they
said,
“what
kind
of
meeting
was
this?”
and
this
is
--
this
--
i
don't,
this
--
as
it
seen
to
me
to
be
terribly
sinister
important.
answer,
“it
is
what
they
called
a
plenum.”
it
was
merely
your
report
of
the
work
that
was
carried
on.
a
plenum
means
of
fullness
literally,
it
was
the
report
work
that
was
carried
on
by
people
in
the
northwest.
and
then
if
you
look
at
page
13,
where
it
goes
over
it
again,
not
13
–
12,
the
only
thing
they
could
--
they
asked
in
the
purpose
of
meeting
and
he
repeats
in
a
rather
colorful
account
that
he
says,
everybody
would
get
up
and
give
--
give
a
glowing
account
of
what
they
had
done,
there
were
more
or
less
fabricating
he
says,
and
the
only
person
he
can
remember,
is
a
man
by
the
name
(inaudible)
speeches.
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
petitioner
made
speeches.
the
evidence
amounts
to
the
fact
that
he
went
to
party
meetings
if
you
accept
that
evidence.
now,
let's
take
a
look
of
the
man
that
knew
him,
that
really
knew
him
and
was
a
member
of
his
--
his
unit
according
to
his
testimony,
what
he
said
about
him
and
you
have
a
very
different
picture
than
what
knight
said,
look
at
page
29.
question,
“did
mr.
mackie
in
your
presence
ever
advocate
to
overthrow
of
government
by
force
of
violence
or
the
use
of
the
illegal
means.”
answer,
“no
he
never
did.”
question,
“would
you
say
to
your
knowledge
that
mr.
mackie
was
one
of
those
people
who
was
more
particularly
interested
or
concerned
with
the
problems
that
faced
the
country
during
to
the
depression
such
as
unemployment
and
relief?”
answer,
“i
think
very
much
interested
than
top
of
29.”
question,
“was
he
what
you
would
call
one
of
the
party
intellectuals?”
answer,
“what
do
you
mean
by
that?”
question,
“was
he
very
much
on
theory,
political
discussion?”
answer,
“no.”
question,
“he
is
more
interested
in
bread
and
butter
topics
at
the
day,
what
to
do
for
unemployment
relief?”
answer,
“i
would
say
so,
yes.”
question,
“was
most
of
the
activities
(inaudible)
branch
toward
these
specific
problems?”
answer,
“yes
they
were,”
now
look
at
the
summary
on
page
30,
in
which
the
attorney
asked
the
witness,
if
this
the
correct
summary
of
knight's
testimony?
question,
“you
saw
mr.
mackie
the
number
of
meetings
that
you
claim
were
close
meetings
to
the
communist
party
that
he
was
not
functionary
of
the
party,
that
you
yourself
thought
members
the
works
of
the
soviet
union
is
the
educational
chairman
of
that
group
but
that
mr.
mackie
did
not
participate
any
of
the
discussions
that
you
held
in
that
connection,
that
mr.
mackie
did
not
distribute
literature
and
the
mr.
mackie
never
served
under
you
--
under
your
direction
in
any
capacity,
and
that
as
near
as
you
know,
mackie
never
attended
any
communist
party
conventions,
is
that
correct?”
answer,
“yes,
that's
right.”
and
then
later
on,
“is
that
correct
summary
of
your
testimony
as
far
as
i
went?”
he
says,
“yes
that's
right.”
now,
these
are
people
who
were
testifying
12
years
after
the
events
and
you're
now
always
little
pieces
of
unexplored
odds
and
ends
and
i
think
the
principal
reason
it
wasn't
explored
was
because
the
rowoldt
case
had
not
been
decided
and
people
didn't
understand
that
the
nature
--
of
the
activity
and
the
significance
of
the
membership
was
as
important
as
rowoldt
later
made
clear.
but
the
least
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
could
have
done
is
before
they
had
hatched
to
these
little
grids
and
drafts,
as
soon
as
they're
kind
of
sinister
significance
that
mr.
davis
gives
to
it,
i
think,
completely
unwarrantedly
would
be
to
reopen
the
record
so
they
--
people
could
try
the
issue
with
some
knowledge
of
what
the
issue
was
about
at
the
time
they
took
this
testimony
from
knight,
from
wilmot
at
the
time
the
petitioner
testified.
they
didn't
know
what
the
interpretation
is
going
to
be
that
was
given
in
rowoldt.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
--
i'm
afraid,
i
didn't
follow
you.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
that
is
--
that
is
not
the
--
that
is
not
quite
so,
because
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
rowoldt
itself
--.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
i
know,
your
honor,
in
rowoldt
itself,
the
facts
which
led
you
to
write
that
opinion
for
the
court
were
not
elicited
by
rowoldt
counsel,
they
weren't
elicited
at
the
deportation
hearing.
they
were
elicited
at
an
interview
prior
to
the
hearing
which
the
immigration
service
at
which
the
immigration
service
questioned
rowoldt,
and
all
they
were
tying
to
get
form
rowoldt
really
was
matters
on
which
to
deport
him,
they
did
not
have
any
understanding
that
member,
the
word
“member”
was
limited
in
the
sense
that
the
rowoldt
decision
itself
limited
it
and
it's
really
a
happenstance
that
evidence
came
out
in
rowoldt.
mr.
joseph
forer
except
that
i
say
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
that
the
story
i'm
giving
here
is
that
the
only
facts
you
have
in
this
record
if
you
read
them
fairly
is
that
you
have
a
--
and
disbelief
the
petitioner
that
you
have
rank
and
file
enacted
person
who
went
to
meeting
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
paid
dues
have
no
political
interest
other
than
on
the
bread
and
butter
matters.
now,
i
say
that's
a
fair
version
of
the
facts
and
i
say
that
his
version
to
the
contrary
is
not
a
fair
version
of
the
testimony.
mr.
joseph
forer
and
i
say
--
mr.
joseph
forer
they
could
have
been
brought
up
but
they
weren't.
mr.
joseph
forer
and
they
couldn't
have
been
brought
out
in
this
case
because
the
witness
testified
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
they
--
they
couldn't
have
brought
it
out
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes
and
let
me
explain
it
now.
they
couldn't
have
brought
it
out
from
the
witness
because
here
the
witness
denied
from
the
petitioner
because
here
the
petitioner
denied
he
was
a
member.
they
--
if
they
had
known
rowoldt
they
might
have
done
a
better
job
of
cross
examining
the
governments
--
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
all
i'm
driving
at.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
i
don't
mean
that
all.
i
don't
meant
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
i
don't
mean
that
at
all.
i
mean
that
they
--
if
they
had
been
aware
about
rowoldt,
they
could
oriented
their
cross
examination
of
the
government
witnesses
in
that
direction,
i
don't
see
anything
particularly
startling
about
that.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
if
i
wasn't
clear
but
that's
all
i
meant.
thank
you.
