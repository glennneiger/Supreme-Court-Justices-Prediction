justice
felix
frankfurter
were
briefs
submitted
on
that
motion
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
there's
argument
but
was
there
an
oral
presentation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
denial
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
supplemental?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
separate
volume?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it,
that
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
in
his
application
for
suspension
for
deportation
and
filed
with
the
clerk's
office
here?
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
only
testimony
we
have
from
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
about
which
one
can
draw
inferences
bearing
on
the
chief
justice's
question
as
to
intellectual
qualification?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
him
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
forer
has
--
has
this
court
or
have
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
either
by
way
of
decision,
i
am
sure
we
haven't,
by
way
of
decision
or
comment
on
the
proposition
which
you
are
now
urging
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
first
two
of
the
vast
category
that
you
just
mentioned
is
there
a
time
limit
within
which
the
disqualifying
presence
must
occur?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
negotiation
you
have
been
saying
is
length
of
residence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
cases
that
have
come
before
us,
have
been
cases
of
long
residences?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
you
can
say
that
he
became
a
communist
in
america
not
with
american
native
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
geographic
fact
and
no
more?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all
spelled
out
in
his
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
complicated
question
in
there
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
time
limit
within
which
your
first
class
can
be
deported?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
in
those
cases
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
those
cases
too,
you
have
had
long
residence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
were
not
and
you
would
do
this
statistically
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
hour?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
such
a
study?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
indication
why
this
man
never
got
the
citizenship
papers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
--
he
is
--
he
is
guaranteed
a
judicial
trial
because
he
was
a
citizen.
i
mean,
that
â€“
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
citizenship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
think
he
isn't
but
the
denaturalization
cases
are
citizens.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
is
a
great
big
difference
between
being
a
citizen
and
not
a
citizen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
citi
--
citizenship
isn't
a
technicality,
mr.
forer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
that
there
were
two
hearings
before
judge
solomon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
in
the
cases
involving
the
issue
of
citizenship,
not
denaturalization,
but
when
the
issue
of
citizenship
is
tended
there,
the
courts
have
been
explicit
that
the
quantum
of
evidence
required
is
irregular?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
has
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
and
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
way
it
wanted
it,
if
we
look
at
the
record
as
i've
paused
around
and
i
saw
mackie
now
niukkanen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
one
of
these
two
that
the
petitioner
said
he
never
saw
him
(voice
overlap)
never
laid
eyes
on
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
like
our
word
plenary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
plain,
that's
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
believing
this
fellow,
according
to
his
own
testimony,
he
worked
only
intermittently
during
the
period
from
29
hours
and
30
hours,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
getting
the
impression,
i
have
notice
that
someone
that
would
reveal
at
this
that
in
his
testimony
before
the
board,
before
the
examiner,
he
rather
indicated
that
a
lack
of
interest
in
political
matters?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
his
test.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
been
meaning
--
i
been
meaning
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
acknowledge
knowing
knight?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
knight
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
something
like
on
it
50
times.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
flatly
denied
that
he
ever
laid
eyes
on
wilmot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
rereading,
meaning
he
read
that
the
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
read
this
--
this
making
(inaudible)
and
on
the
basis
of
that
he
believe
knight
and
wilmot
to
disbelieve?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
would
you
agree
that
whether
he
is
the
kind
of
a
communist
under
rowoldt,
if
i
may
be
short
at
it,
that
it
is
a
question
of
law
for
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
question
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
he
said
he
had
law
for
the
district
court
first
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
were
the
200
figure
contends
those
who
now
were
found
to
the
communists
at
the
time
of
the
determinations
were
found
to
be
members
as
against
those
who
would
comply
to
have
had
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
meant
to
ask.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
only
include
those
at
the
time
of
the
deportation
decision
were
found
to
be
members,
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
240
includes
both
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
includes
both
those
who
at
the
time
of
the
deportation
determination
were
found
to
be
members.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
whereas
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
those
who
have
some
previous
one
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it,
we
don't
have
to
determine.
we
don't
have
to
determine
whether
those
deportations
enhance
the
security
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
have
you
any
figures
as
to
the
rejections
by
congress
as
to
suspension
by
the
attorney
general?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
was
just
curious.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
just
general
interest
for
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
isn't
too
difficult,
just
as
a
matter
of
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
take
too
much
time
it
isn't
worth
it
for
me
at
least.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
middle
of
the
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
before
you
go
on,
i
shouldn't
interrupt
you,
you
traced
a
little
while
ago
the
history
of
the
legislation
from
the
beginning
at
page
--
to
the
interest
of
labor
and
(inaudible)
myself
in
words,
did
i
find
that
history
in
in
or
where
would
--
is
there
any
confirmation
that
is
the
whole
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
answer
probably
is
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
rely
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
temptation
was
too
strong
for
you
not
to
refer
to
those
five
denials.
i
thought
--
i
suppose
the
temptation
is
too
strong
not
to
refer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
at
the
certiorari
even
though
there
were
five
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
goes
on
to
study
your
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
when
it
was
permitted
to
be
present
which
is
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
can
you
go.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
sometimes
had
been
--
as
a
kid,
i
was
present
at
political
meeting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
that
cause
argument
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
asked
that
question
in
cross
examination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
evidently
in
rowoldt,
they
knew
what
kind
of
facts
to
elicit
which
was
the
basis
for
the
decision,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
say
in
rowoldt
itself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
preceded
the
rowoldt
decision
the
facts
were
elicited
on
the
base
of
which
there
was
a
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
written
that
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
what
their
legal
interpretation
was,
that's
for
this
court
and
other
courts.
what
i'm
saying
that
the
facts
were
in
the
rowoldt
record
and
therefore,
the
argument
that
they're
not
in
this
record
it's
to
me
not
very
impressive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
story
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
where
is
this
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i
do
not
follow
the
argument
that
these
alleviating
or
mitigating
or
minimizing
factors
couldn't
have
been
brought
by
counsel
because
they
didn't
know
what
questions
to
ask.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
because
they
didn't
have
rowoldt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
understand,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
mean
that
he
might
then
have
confessed
that
he
was
a
communist,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
it
was
startling.
i
just
didn't
follow
your
argument.
