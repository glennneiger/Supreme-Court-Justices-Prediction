mr.
nels
peterson
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
nels
peterson
let
me
say
at
the
outset
that
i
shall
address
my
argument
to
the
constitutional
aspects
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
upon
which
this
man
was
arrested.
let
me
further
say
that
i'm
a
little
a
bit
odd
to
stand
up
here
and
(inaudible)
in
part
the
arguments
have
made
--
were
made
by
joseph.
h.
choate
in
1893
in
the
case
fong
haw
tan
that
has
been
referred
to
by
this
court.
in
arguing
the
constitutional
--
the
constitutionality
of
this
act,
i
shall
address
my
remarks
that
this
act
is
a
bill
of
attainder,
it's
an
ex
post
facto
law
or
denies
due
process
or
denies
freedom
of
speech
under
the
first
amendment.
now
in
the
setting
of
the
control
of
the
immigrants,
i
think
it
must
be
understood
that
when
the
constitution
was
adopted
mostly
by
lawyers
in
1787,
that
they
--
this
was
--
these
were
people
who
were
immigrants
themselves.
immigrant
has
a
special
meaning
and
connotation.
everyone
who
--
that
they
are
persons
that
people
of
this
land
as
of
that
time
were
immigrants.
the
bills
of
attainder
and
ex
post
facto
of
the
laws
were
well
known
to
the
lawyers
who
drafted
the
constitution.
now,
in
the
body
of
the
constitution
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
division
between
the
citizen
and
person.
it's
is
the
constitution
directs
itself
to
people
and
to
persons.
the
--
in
the
first
article
of
the
body
of
the
constitution
that
was
put
in
by
the
constitutional
convention,
the
drafters
of
the
constitution
they
put
in
--
in
the
first
article
that
their
--
that
congress
shall
pass
no
bill
of
attainder
nor
ex
post
facto
of
law.
now,
when
that
was
submitted
to
the
people
in
1789,
they
--
they
added
the
first
ten
amendments.
now
the
--
the
first
amendment
was
not
directed
to
citizens,
it
was
directed
to
persons.
the
fifth
amendment
guaranteeing
due
process
was
directed
to
persons.
so
in
that
setting
then,
we
must
now
look
then
at
what
is
the
extreme
of
constitutional
history
as
it
relates
to
this
problem.
the
constitution
also
provided
that
the
congress
could
enact
and
would
--
and
was
delegated
authority
to
enact
a
uniform
method
of
naturalization.
the
body
of
the
constitution
also
directed
that
the
federal
government
could
regulate
foreign
commerce.
now,
there
--
there
is
no
specific
provision
in
the
constitution
about
deportation
of
aliens
that's
the
essence
of
what
has
been
included
in
the
body
of
the
constitution.
now,
in
that
light,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
first
case
that
i
can
find
where
this
court
had
occasion
to
look
at
the
question
of
bill
of
attainder.
in
1782,
the
sovereign
state
of
georgia
passed
a
law
in
which
the
legislative
body
said
that,
“any
person
who
had
supported
the
british
in
the
revolution
was
banished
and
had
no
rights
to
the
courts.
mr.
cooper
was
--
apparently
had
lived
in
georgia
had
supported
the
british
king
and
he
sued
on
a
1000
pound
note.
the
defense
was
that
he
had
no
rights
to
the
courts
of
georgia.
now
the
circuit
court
of
georgia
sustained
that
defense.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
did
likewise.
this
court
in
1800
reviewed
that
legislation
and
reviewed
this
defense,
in
the
four
opinions.
the
--
it
was
said
that
in
two
of
opinions,
that
since
it
did
not
appear
from
the
record
that
mr.
--
that
mr.
cooper
was
--
had
committed
the
act
of
treason
in
any
county
in
georgia,
it
--
they're
forced
then
not
a
bill
attainder
meaning
and
accepting
the
--
then
well
know
definition
of
a
bill
of
attainder,
that
is
a
legislative
act
which
imposes
a
punishment
and
substitute
the
word
penalty
because
it
means
pains
and
penalties
less
than
death,
historically
without
a
judicial
trial.
and
so
therefore,
they
said
there
was
no
denial
of
a
judicial
trial
when
it
did
not
appear
from
the
record
that
he
was
triable
for
treason
in
any
county
in
georgia.
now,
--
but
in
any
event
mr.
justice
chase
said
i
question
the
power
of
--
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
to
declare
invalid
a
legislative
act
of
a
state,
this
was
before
marbury
versus
madison
in
the
whole
stream
of
history
--
of
judicial
history
of
baghdad.
the
--
but
they
said
in
any
event
this
was
an
act
passed
in
1782
before
the
adoption
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now,
the
--
the
next
it
seems
that
the
bill
--
bill
of
attainders,
historically
and
before
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
has
arisen
from
legislation
that
occurred
during
a
period
of
great
political
excitement.
in
following
the
civil
war,
you
have
the
illustration
of
the
constitution
of
--
of
state
of
missouri
which
imposed
a
test
oath,
a
person
had
to
sign
an
affidavit
to
preach,
to
teach,
to
be
a
lawyer,
among
other
things.
he
had
to
sign
a
test
oath
that
he
had
not
supported
the
south.
cummings
is
a
catholic
priest,
went
on
preaching
anyway
without
the
test
oath
and
without
being
licensed
by
missouri.
this
court
struck
it
down
and
said
a
bill
of
attainder
because
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
was
to
impose
a
punishment,
a
penalty,
against
a
class
of
persons.
the
same
--
on
the
same,
the
very
same
day,
the
ex
parte
garland
decided
by
this
court,
a
lawyer
not
admitted
--
admitted
to
this
court
in
1860
who
pleaded
his
own
case
and
congress
had
passed
a
law
and
saying
that
no
one
could
be
admitted
to
practice
in
the
supreme
court
unless
they
took
a
test
oath
all
of
the
same
as
cummings
essentially
and
they
have
not
supported
the
south.
mr.
garland,
a
lawyer
said
the
he
could
not
take
such
oath
because
he
had
supported
the
south,
he
had
been
convicted,
and
he
had
been
pardoned
by
the
president.
they
struck
it
down
said
“bill
of
attainder,”
this
is
a
deprivation
of
--
it's
a
legislative
act
which
imposes
a
penalty
without
a
judicial
trial.
now,
the
next
great
case
on
the
--
and
which
is
the
most
comprehensive,
it
seems
to
me
on
the
bill
of
attainder,
is
united
states
versus
lovett.
1943,
there
was
a
legislative
act,
passed
in
the
middle
of
world
war
ii,
a
period
of
great
political
excitement
against
--
directed
against
mr.
dodd,
mr.
watson,
and
robert
morss
lovett
withholding
their
salaries,
stricken
down
by
this
court
as
a
bill
of
attainder.
now,
the
next
case
is
that
has
been
decided
by
this
court
is
a.c.a.
versus
douds
where
it
was
said
that
that
was
not
a
bill
of
attainder,
the
act
of
congress
which
required
a
noncommunist
affidavit
from
a
labor
union
official
was
not
a
bill
of
attainder
because
it
had
a
prospective
effect
and
there
was
a
choice
given.
now
with
that
background
and
assuming
that
this
court
will
agree
that,
as
it
has
said
before
in
contrary
to
fong
haw
tan
decided
in
1893
on
the
--
on
the
chinese
exclusion
legislation,
that
this
is
an
exercise
of
a
constitutional
power,
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
and
not
upon
an
inherent
sovereignty
power.
that
was
mr.
gray
--
mr.
justice
gray's
opinion
in
fong
haw
tan
decided
in
1893,
where
he
said
that
the
--
this
was
an
exercise
of
the
inherent
sovereignty
power.
mr.
justice
brewer
wrote
a
stinging
dissent
and
he
said,
“no
there
is
no
end
to
this
doctrine
of
inherent
sovereign
power
because
it's
not
spelled
out
in
the
constitution,”
no
one
knows
it's
in.
mr.
brewer
--
mr.
justice
brewer
dissented
as
well
as
mr.
chief
justice
fuller
and
there
mr.
justice
field.
now,
looked
at
in
that
part,
here's
an
act
passed
in
1950
during
the
korean
war
and
after
the
atom
bomb,
they
(inaudible)
political
excitement.
the
act
is
internal
security
act,
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
declarations
about
the
communist
party
in
the
united
states
speaks
as
of
the
present,
1950.
it
does
not
say
that
the
communist
party
in
the
1930s
or
anytime
passed,
why
it
speaks
--
it
is
used
in
the
present
tense.
now,
however
the
act
where
it
says
that
anytime
after
entry,
a
person
who
has
been
found
to
be
a
member
is
--
can
be
deported.
it
has
been
given
a
retroactive
effect
and
it
has
been
applied
to
this
man.
the
warrant
of
arrest
upon
which
he
was
arrested
said,
the
base
upon
evidence
that
the
immigration
department
had
and
since
entry
and
that
he'd
entered
the
country
in
1909.
they
don't
question
so
far
as
the
knowledge
of
the
person
is
concerned
and
the
statute
of
limitation,
there
is
none,
no
one
could
know.
well,
what
time
the
government
would
claim
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
after
1909.
now
with
that--
with
that
setting
in
mind,
the
--
and
assuming
that
the
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
then
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
then
applies.
this
i
say
is
punishment.
this
court
has
said
it
is
punishment
for
deportation
for
a
person
to
be
deported.
it
is
--
it
has
a
retroactive
effect
imposing
a
penalty
for
that
which
was
innocent
when
done.
now,
i
recognize
that
this
court
in
the
harisiades
case
decided
in
1952
in
construing
the
alien
registration
act
of
1940
said
that,
“the
ex
post
facto
provision
of
the
constitution
was
limited
to
criminal
punishment
and
therefore
the
ex
post
facto
provision
of
the
constitution
did
not
apply.
we
think
the
premise
upon
which
that
has
been
made
is
incorrect.
we
think
that
the
harisiades
decision
should
be
overruled.
now,
getting
down
further
then
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the,
this
is
a
valid
constitutional
exercise
of
a
--
of
a
specific
provision
with
the
constitution
respecting
regulation
of
foreign
commerce,
we
think
that
the
--
that
then
--
that
due
process
would
require
under
the
fifth
amendment
which
says,
persons
that
due
process
would
require
that
--
if
they
proved
by
a
proof
that
is
equivalent
to
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
by
clear,
convincing
an
unequivocal
evidence
which
is
required
in
that
in
denaturalization
proceedings.
now,
mr.
--
the
american
committee
for
protection
of
foreign
born
has
been
permitted
to
file
a
brief
amicus
curiae
cited
as
one
of
the
citations
there
as
a
rather
comprehensive
and
complete
annual
analysis
of
the
various
questions
on
deportation,
entitled
the
constitutional
status
of
lawfully
admitted,
permanent
resident
aliens
published
in
yale
law
journal
of
1959.
there
is
an
exhaustive
analysis
of
every
case
that
has
been
decided
this
court.
now
in
the
--
getting
down
to
the
case
of
galvan
versus
press,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
writing
the
opinion,
impliedly
recognized
the
--
a
separate
status
for
the
person
who
has
been
admitted
for
lawful
permanent
residence.
he
occupies
a
status
that
is
different
from
the
illegal
entry,
the
temporary
resident,
or
the
person
who
has
been
erroneously
admitted.
the
cases
we've
cited
in
galvan
versus
press
were
bugajewitz
and
fong
haw
tan.
now
the
--
if
we
look
at
the
case
of
bugajewitz,
it
was
really
a
case
where
the
congress
had
--
was
controlling
entry
into
this
country.
they
--
the
bugajewitz
case,
the
only
thing
that
was
involved
there
was
the
conclusive
presumption,
established
that
a
prostitute
who
became
a
prostitute
within
three
years
was
deemed
to
be
have
been
illegally
admitted.
mr.
justice
holmes
said
that
a
three-year
statute
of
limitations
or
a
three-year
basis
to
which
we
go
back,
formed
a
reasonable
--
formed
a
reasonable
basis
to
impose
a
condition
to
raise
the
--
to
support
the
presumption
and
thus
due
process.
the
--
i
see
that
my
time
is
about
up.
i
submit
your
honors
that
this
is
a
case
of
fundamental
importance
and
i
do
want
to
say
that
the
--
in
respect
to
the
question
asked
by
one
of
the
justices
that
the
suspension
of
deportation
was
raised
before
the
ninth
circuit
of
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
december
1957,
eight
days
after
rowoldt
versus
perfetto.
the
--
when
the
court
denied
certiorari
at
that
time,
we
thought
this
question
was
precluded.
it
had
been
passed
upon
by
the
federal
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
had
denied
certiorari.
the
present
appeal
arise
from
--
arises
from
an
additional
petition
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
for
injunctive
relief
and
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
and
that
how
--
that's
how
communist
gets
before
this
court.
we
thought
we
were
precluding
from
raising
the
question
of
suspension,
denial
of
suspension
of
deportation.
the
--
and
there
it
–
therefore
it's
not
before
this
court.
now,
to
summarize
the
--
it
would
appear
to
me
that
a
proper
construction
of
this
act
that
is
involved
here
then
would
be
based
upon
a
constitutional
exercise
of
power
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
regulate
commerce
and
not
upon
any
ideas
of
inherent
sovereignty.
but
then
every
other
constitutional
guarantee
as
this
court
has
said
before
applies
to
the
person
who
is
here
all
of
the
other
constitutional
guarantees
apply.
and
that
a
distinction
can
and
should
be
made
as
to
the
person
who
has
been
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
than
the
illegal
entrant,
the
temporary
entrant,
or
the
person
who
has
been
erroneously
admitted,
a
separate
status
should
--
should
apply
to
that
person.
mr.
nels
peterson
well,
now
the
--
every
--
the
difference
is
and
it
should
be
that
the
bill
of
attainder
should
apply
to
the
person,
that
the
person
who
has
been
admitted
for
lawful
residence
is
entitled
to
protection
of
ex
post
facto
law.
that
the
person
is
entitled
to
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
and
he
has
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
and
assembly
in
the
first
amendment.
it
should
be
guaranteed
to
him.
the
--
and
that
here
is
a
first
this
act
as
it
applies
to
mackie.
it
--
there
are
elements
of
a
bill
of
attainder
every
element
of
the
bill
of
attainder
particularly
in
the
lovett
is
present.
every
element
of
an
ex
post
facto
law
is
present
except
this
is
not
criminal
punishment.
the
court
has
said
it's
not
criminal
punishment.
if
this
--
it
is
not
--
it
has
not
been
thought
that
any
citizen
could
be
deprived
of
a
jury
trial
if
a
penalty
was
to
be
imposed
upon
him
of
this
kind.
the
--
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
rules
of
evidence.
they're
not
--
it's
not
enough
they're
followed
here
in
this
administrative
proceeding.
there
is
no
guarantee
for
a
trial
in
any
sense.
this
is
an
administrative
hearing
where
the
rules
of
evidence
are
not
followed.
where
the
--
the
residing
officer
is
not
a
lawyer,
the
prosecutor
so
to
speak
is
not
a
lawyer.
these
are
fundamental
guarantees
to
--
to
liberty.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
presents
again,
this
court
has
issued,
i
think,
this
is
the
fourth
certiorari
in
this
kind
of
case
and
i
say
that
this
--
what
this
court
does
today
in
this
case
if
we
over
abuse
to
say
