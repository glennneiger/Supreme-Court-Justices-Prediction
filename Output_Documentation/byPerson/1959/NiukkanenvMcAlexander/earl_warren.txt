mr.
forer,
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
indicating
what
his
educational
background
was,
mr.
forer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
peterson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
testimonial
wilmot
and
the
other
fellow,
is
there
anything
to
indicate
what
kind
of
party
activities
the
petitioner
was
engaged
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
the
testimony
that
or
is
there
a
testimony
by
wilmot
and
the
other
witness
to
the
effect
that
he
was
interested
in
political
matters?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
judge
said
he
believed
knight?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
there
--
wasn't
there
something
at
some
place
along
the
line
where
admittedly
knight
lied?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
what
--
what
was
that
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
of
course
it
is
felony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
accept
rowoldt
and
distinguish
this
case
from
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
distinction
do
you
make
mr.
davis
between
the
galvan
case
and
the
rowoldt
case
on
the
facts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
know
whether
or
not
there
have
been
any,
i
--
i
have
no
knowledge
on
this
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
only
thing
there
mr.
davis
that
bothers
me
is
that
as
i
understood
you
in
this
case
there
--
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
what
kind
of
party
activities
it
was
he
was
engaged
in?
now,
they
did
have
some
--
some
economic
activities
to
--
to
secure
employment
and
so
forth
and
would
you
make
any
distinction
if
he
had
been
able
to
establish
that
those
were
the
only
party
activities
that
--
that
he
knew
about
or
participated
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
bearing
on
that
same
--
same
thing
mr.
davis,
i
understood
you
to
say
there
were
--
there
were
--
you
recognized
two
kinds
of
membership.
one
that
doesn't
carve
against
the
man
particularly
because
probably
isn't
--
it
isn't
a
knowing
membership
in
all
of
the
activities,
and
the
other
is
where
he
is
really
a
member
of
the
party.
now,
in
this
case
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
no
definite,
there
is
no
definite
evidence
against
him
that
he
--
he
participated
in
--
in
what
were
subversive
activities
and
what
he
did
was
not
defined
and
on
the
question
of
his
membership,
it
apparently
wasn't
such
a
very
important
membership
because
he
was
paying
dues
at
the
rate
of
25
cents
a
week.
that
was
the
criteria
for
his
being
in
the
organization
and
when
he
failed
to
pay
his
24
cents
a
week,
they
dropped
him
for
non-payment
of
dues.
now,
would
that
have
any
bearing
on
whether
he
was
of
one
of
the
other
types
of
membership?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
i
remember
correctly
in
galvan,
galvan
was
the
chairman
of
the
educational
committee
of
the
party.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
there
--
is
there
testimony
in
here
that
he
--
he
is
positively
or
was
positively
a
top
fraction
member?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
do
we
find
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
supplemental.
chief
justice
earl
warren
16?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
see.
who
--
what
witness
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wilmot
and
what
did
he
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
did
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
forer.
