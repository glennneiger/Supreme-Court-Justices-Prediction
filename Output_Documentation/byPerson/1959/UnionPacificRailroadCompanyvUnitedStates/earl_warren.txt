number
98,
union
pacific
railroad
company,
appellant,
versus
united
states.
mr.
collins,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
made
a
part
--
as
part
of
this
roller
service?
is
that
what
as
to
what
the
commission
did
in
that
at
that
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
was
this
purpose
of
permitting
them
to
go
this
long
route?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
i
understand
that
part.
but
--
but
what
i
am
--
you're
pointing
this
out
to
us
as
long,
long
route
that
they
took.
now,
what
i
am
interested
in
is
to
know
whether
this
was
done
to
accommodate
the
--
the
railroads
and
the
shippers
on
--
on
this
roller
service
that
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
want
to
ask,
what
was
the
purpose
of
--
of
permitting
him
to
have
this
long
route?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
was
that
a
part
of
their
--
their
tariffs?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
but
that's
a
part
of
their
--
of
their
regular
tariff,
their
--
their
published
rates.
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
did
they
permit
them
under
the
--
under
that
long
route
that
you've
just
shown
us
to
put
them
of
at
sidings
and
let
them
--
let
them
in
all
practical
--
for
all
practical
purposes
be
stored
there
until
--
until
shipper
was
ready
to
have
them
move
again.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
what
you
are
doing
in
this
case
is
without
any
--
any
tariff
rates
taking
them
over
those
slow
routes
and
not
permitting
them
to
--
to
be
put
on
sidings
until
the
--
the
commodity
is
sold
and
then
--
and
then
move
them
wherever
the
shipper
wants
them,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
--
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
doesn't,
well,
i
am
wrong.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
slow
service
was
--
resulted
merely
from
the
necessities
of
the
situation
and
not
because
they
were
permitting
the
--
the
goods
to
--
to
be
in
--
in
route
longer
than
was
necessary
to
make
the
trip
over
--
over
this
route,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may,
you
may,
mr.
collins.
mr.
laughlin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
aren't
there
some
proceedings
of
that
kind
going
on
before
the
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
laughlin,
i
was
a
little
surprised
to
hear
you
say
that
these
unnecessary
delays
that
the
shipper
is
accorded
on
this
trip
is
--
is
no
violation
of
any
kind,
that
he's
entitled
to
--
to
have
that.
now,
i
noticed
that
the
court
found
that
the
--
that
they
put
them
on
this
--
these
cars
unnecessarily
on
sidings
and
that
--
that
that
caused
undue
expense
to
the
railroads.
now,
i
was
wondering
in
view
of
your
statement,
what
would
be
the
effect
if
they
--
if
they
took
--
took
the
lumber
right
straight
through
to
a
destination
and
then
left
it
there
on
a
siding
until
they
sold
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
leave
the
demurrage
--
demurrage
out
of
it
because
i
--
i
remember,
you
said
that
if
it
wasn't
for
the
demurrage
thing,
there
wouldn't
be
any
--
any
question
about
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
didn't
the
b&o
case
in
305
u.s.
hold
that
they
could
not
give
them
the
equivalent
storage
in
that
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
--
that's
what
i
understood
your
case
was
but
i
--
i
thought
in
your
opening
statement,
you
said
that
you're
only
interested
in
the
question
of
demurrage.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
are
other
factors
in
your
case
than
demurrage,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
in
effect.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
--
but
the
district
court
made
some
findings
which
went
over
showing
us
concern
with
things
other
than
--
other
than
demurrage.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
are
you
--
are
those
still
in
the
case?
are
you
interested
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
are
in
the
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
won't
trouble
you
with
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
won't
--
i
won't
trouble
you
to
say
how
now.
do
it
in
your
own
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
want
to
know
-
if
they
are
in
or
they
are
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
laughlin?
are
those
six
companies
that
have
the
hearings
now
before
the
commission
being
permitted
--
are
they
being
permitted
now
during
the
pendency
of
this
proceedings
to
do
the
things
comparable
to
what
these
people
are
enjoined
from
doing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
posted
them
as
schedules.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
i
--
do
i
understand
then
that
--
that
although
those
six
companies
have
done
it,
the
union
pacific
refuses
to
--
to
file
schedules
and
avail
itself
for
the
same
procedure
that
these
six
companies
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
laughlin,
as
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
all
of
you're
interested
in
is
too
see
that
the
union
pacific
files
this
tariff
as
these
other
six
companies
have
and
submits
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
--
of
the
commission
to
determine
whether
that
tariff
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable
in
accordance
with
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
--
oh,
yes,
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
collins.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
wasn't
for
the
pleasure
of
the
passengers
though.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i've
read
in
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
the
normal
way
to
do
that
for
you
to
file
your
rates
in
and
--
and
let
the
commission
investigate
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no.
not
for
this
for
this
service
that
you're
rendering
now.
not
for
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
am
not
--
i
am
not
saying
what
kind
you
should
charge
but
you
--
but
you
haven't
--
you
--
you
haven't
filed
any
rates,
as
i
understand
it,
for
this
particular
kind
of
a
service?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess.
