mr.
collins,
may
i
--
you're
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence.
i
want
you
to
finish.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
repeat
what
you
said
a
few
minutes
ago
regarding
the
non
requirement
or
perhaps
even
the
forbidding
and
stating
in
the
tariffs
the
services
that
a
carrier
may
render.
you
said
something
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
seems
to
me
as
a
surprise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
asking
out
of
ignorance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
instance,
do
you
have
to
--
do
you
have
to
include
in
the
tariff
i
think
to
the
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
transit
--
transit
with
advantages,
you
have
to
give
those,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
that
is
to
be
put.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
there
is
this
omnibus
call
to
which
you
just
referred,
namely
in
others
--
what
was
the
phrase?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
commission.
and
as
to
those
that
is
categories
of
services
not
specified
in
the
statute
need
not
be
enumerated
in
the
tariff
unless
the
commission
specifically
provides
so,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
they
give
you
relief
under
the
long-and-short-haul
clause,
do
they
not
specify
precisely
over
what
routes
you
can
go?
justice
felix
frankfurter
relief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
--
without
any
specification
as
to
what
you
can
do
within
the
limits,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
your
--
is
your
--
am
i
always
simplifying
if
i
state
the
question,
the
case
that
you
present
is
that
the
commission
if
it
deemed
this
a
hole
to
be
plugged
could've
plugged
it
that
it
had
to
be
done
so,
therefore,
you
have
the
freedom
that
you
--
that
you
urged,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
the
inference
of
the
case
done
to
those
two
cases
at
which
you
are
referring.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you,
as
discussed
in
the
outset,
mr.
laughlin.
suppose
there
were
no
question
that
what
the
union
pacific
did
was
not
discriminatory.
maybe
--
maybe
once
can
make
that
--
i
am
talking
about
what
the
record
shows.
but
suppose
that
this
was
open
to
all
who
might
avail
themselves,
would
your
position
be
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
elkins
act
must
be
a
departure
from
the
public
tariff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
mr.
collins
is
right
that
--
well,
i
suppose
i
found
a
theory
that
--
that
although
--
although
this
--
what
the
service
they
gave
need
not
be
in
the
--
in
the
tariff,
it
--
it's
an
(inaudible)
upon
what
is
in
the
tariff.
that's
your
position,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
departure
--
knowing
departure
from
the
public
tariff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
an
implied
prohibition
against
doing
this
in
the
tariff
and
that
they
didn't
set
forth
this
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
imply
that
--
you
must
imply
that,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
they
put
this
into
the
tariff
or
could
if
it's
conceivable
that
if
they
spread
this
from
the
tariff
and
submitted
it
to
the
commission,
that
they
would
have
sanctioned
it?
although
the
commission
have
said
this
language
itself
in
such
abusive
and
forbid
the
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
you'd
have
a
hard
time
convicting
them,
because
elkins
act
as
a
criminal
statute
convicting
them
of
--
of
the
elkins
act
offense,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
would
--
it's
the
same
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
you
now
have
a
proceeding
before
you,
the
result
of
which
might
be
a
legalization,
a
form
of
legalization
of
this
thing,
makes
it
very
questionable
of
the
violation
of
the
elkins
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
can't
see
that
the
commission
can,
except
by
changing
the
tariff
(inaudible),
condone
the
process
on
the
elkins
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
you're
here
--
but
here
saying
this
is
a
violation
of
the
elkins
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
commission
is
taking
the
position
that
it
is
in
violation
of
the
elkins
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
saying
in
effect
--
aren't
you
saying
in
effect
to
pursue
the
chief
justice's
question
that
the
device
of
this
thing
is
that
it's
really
an
evasion
of
the
of
the
demurrage
requirement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
shipper
in
justice
black's
question
had
--
had
15
plans
separated,
geographically
separated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
plans.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
each
stop
that
justice
black
hypothesized,
they
put
on
some
of
these
stops,
which
they
distributed
for
purposes
of
--
for
intra
--
intra-enterprise
reasons.
they've
got
the
15
places,
they've
processed
something,
but
it's
all
on
the
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
would
it
be
different
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
engine
--
there's
something
the
matter
with
the
engine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wouldn't
be
a
demurrage
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
commission
could
fine
--
i
am
asking.
could
the
commission
find
in
the
pending
proceeding
that
under
the
same
great
charges,
they
could
make
that
accommodation
that
is
now
right
in
the
tariff,
specifically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
this
would
only
advantage
as
for
big
shippers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
it
would
only
advantage
a
big
shipper
or
big
shippers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
not
that
they
would
exclude
small
shippers
but
that
their
business
wouldn't
bring
this
kind
of
advantage
into
being.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
commission
put
in
the
pending
proceedings
authorizing
this
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
have
--
but
the
commission
is
asking
the
court
to
grant
an
injunction.
and
therefore,
the
usual
considerations
guiding
a
court
of
equity
in
granting
or
denying
an
injunction
become
relevant
and
wholly
apart
from
the
question
whether
the
--
the
erred
legal
question
whether
the
proceeding
before
the
commission
has
or
has
not
superseded
this
action
as
to
which
one
could
easily
and
readily
say
no,
it
hasn't,
doesn't
leave
unanswered,
whether
or
not,
considering
that
the
same
subject
matter
ultimately
preferential
treatment
of
a
shipper
for
that's
what
this
is,
isn't
it?
i
don't
mean
vis-Ã -vis
some
other
shippers
but
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
against
the
yardstick
of
the
tariff.
that
issue
is
before
the
commission
because
it
granted
the
insertion
of
the
addition
to
the
tariff.
this
service,
namely
--
there
would
be
no
elkins
act
on
which
to
--
with
which
to
operate,
and
therefore,
there
is,
for
me
at
least,
the
serious
question
whether
considering
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with
complicated
tariff.
i
don't
know
whether
lumber
tariffs
are
as
complicated
as
grain
tariffs
with
which
i
had
once
struggled.
whether
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
commission
is
not
considering,
and
it's
saying
whether
or
not
this
very
kind
of
thing
should
be
legalized,
an
injunction
is
the
appropriate
thing
to
ask
to
the
court
of
equity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
argument
that
is
something
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
reasonable
or
unreasonable
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
the
fixed
yardstick.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
yardstick
would
be
altered
if
this
kind
of
a
thing
is
allowed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
there'd
be
no
violation
of
the
elkins
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
come
about
--
if
it
--
if
--
if
it's
included
in
the
tariff,
there
can't
be
a
departure
from
the
tariff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
not
if
you
--
not
if
it
seeks
--
if
a
tariff
permits
it.
and
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
of
course,
you
can't
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
seriously
suggesting
that
if
relief
of
this
kind
was
given
to
other
shippers
that
it
would
not
effect
the
position
of
the
union
pacific.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
it
is
very
relevant,
what's
going
on
there
now,
isn't
it?
therefore,
the
face
of
the
union
pacific
is
affected
by
the
proceedings
affecting
six
other
shippers
of
which
it
is
not
a
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
would
be
very
impressive
argument?
that
if
it's
--
if
it
can't
then
be
put
in
a
tariff
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
can
do
it
without
a
tariff?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
am
suggesting
that.
that
would
be
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
collins.
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
collins,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
noticed
in
your
brief,
merely
looking
at
the
table
of
cases,
(inaudible).
you
don't
refer
to
the
great
northern
case
that
justice
brandeis's
famous
and
well
know
decision
that
technical
questions
can't
be
dealt
with
by
courts.
it
must
be
remitted
to
the
commission.
now,
this
isn't
that
kind
of
a
case.
what
you're
arguing
here
is
whether
on
the
fact
--
whether
--
whether
the
facts
putting
you
in
the
context
with
other
railroads,
this
constitutes
a
departure
and
indeed
a
violation,
both
of
the
elkins
act
and
the
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
that
the
findings
to
that
extent
on
the
record
by
a
district
judge
are
not
the
kind
of
desirable
expert
findings
that
the
commission
ought
to
make.
is
that
your
position
in
effect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
they
--
they
had
not
the
kind
of
finding
the
court
ought
to
make
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
they
are
the
kind
of
findings
the
commission
should
make.
