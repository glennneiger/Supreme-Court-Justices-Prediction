mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
not
an
uncommon
occurrence
for
a
shipper
or
a
consignee
of
a
shipment
to
have
occasion
to
use
a
freight
car
as
a
--
an
instrument
of
storage.
there
is
nothing
in
either
terms
of
statute
or
tariff
which
prevents
a
shipper
from
making
misuse
of
a
freight
car.
however,
because
it
is
such
a
common
occurrence,
all
carriers
including
the
union
pacific
have
enforced
in
effect
a
demurrage
tariff.
the
purpose
of
a
demurrage
tariff
is
to
discourage
the
undue
detention
of
freight
cars
and
to
provide
an
element
of
compensation
to
the
carrier.
it
is
only,
we
submit,
the
existence
of
this
demurrage
tariff
that
stands
in
the
way
of
an
open
holding
of
freight
cars
for
the
convenience
and
accommodation
of
the
shippers.
we
submit
that
it
is
the
--
the
practice
that
has
been
adopted
by
the
union
pacific
and
by
other
carriers
of
intentionally
delaying
the
shipments
while
in
transit
so
as
to
accord
additional
time
for
the
consignee
or
the
owner
of
the
shipment
to
find
a
buyer
for
the
product,
is
to
avoid
the
application
and
observance
of
the
demurrage
tariffs.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes,
insofar
as
we
claim
that
the
practice
is
violative
of
both
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
elkins
act.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
the
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes,
in
--
in
the
sense
that
we
say
that
in
terms
of
the
elkins
act,
it
is
a
concession,
a
rebate,
on
eliminating
or
avoiding
the
word
discrimination.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
whereby
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
a
departure
from
--
or
a
failure
to
--
or
by
property,
it's
a
transfer
afforded
by
less
than
the
tariff
rates.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes.
we
--
we
put
in
terms
of
a
concession
or
advantage.
it
must
be
a
concession
or
advantage
of
some
value
to
the
shipper.
that
element
we
think
is
quite
clearly
present
in
the
case.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that
--
that
is
conceivable
that
they
could
go
either
way
and
of
course
that
is
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
there
are,
wherein
involving
six
carriers
other
than
the
union
pacific.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
for
--
for
purposes
of
the
criminal
statute,
it
might
be
difficult.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes.
i
mean
for
purposes
of
the
conviction,
it
might
be
difficult
to
the
fact.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
if
it
is
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
and
i
think
this
is
true
also
that
the
commission
will
not
determine
whether
or
not
this
practice,
in
the
service
that
is
rendered
here,
is
within
the
prohibitions
of
the
elkins
act.
that
is
beyond
its
--
its
powers.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
we
are
here
at
the
request
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
that
is
quite
right.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well
if
--
once
it
reaches
its
destination,
then
they
have
24
hours
in
which
to
re-consign
it
or
48
hours
in
which
to
unload
it.
and
at
that
point
the
demurrage
tariff
becomes
applicable.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
in
terms
of
existing
tariff
or
this
--
of
this
--
of
statutory
proscription.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
of
course,
b&o
case
was
a
commission
proceeding
in
which
the
railroads
were
providing
in
transit
warehousing.
i
don't
think
the
decision
was
that
they
could
do
it,
but
where
the
compensation
was
--
where
the
service
was
rendered
by
the
--
by
the
carriers
at
less
than
cost,
then
they
were
violate
--
violating
section
6
(7)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
forbidding
the
receipt
of
less
than
--
the
less
compensation
than
the
rate
tariff
provided.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
and
--
and
evading
and
in
adopting
this
device,
they
have
run
a
foul
of
section
6
(7)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
of
course
the
elkins
act.
now,
the
section
6
(1)
of
the
commerce
act
requires
not
only
what
the
carriers
status
rates
but
all
privileges
and
facilities,
accorded
a
shipper
that
go
or
have
any
bearing
or
effect
upon
the
rate
itself.
now,
it
is
that
the
service
that
they
provide
which
we
--
we
submit
is
considerably
more
than
the
mere
fast
service
and
slow
service.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
not
only
interested
in
that,
i
merely
referred
to
the
demurrage
tariffs
as
pointing
out
the
source
of
this
present
controversy
and
the
source
of
the
difficulty
that
we
think
the
union
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
--
pacific
and
other
carriers
are
here
in
now.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
--
because
there
is
no
technical
--
the
demurrage
tariffs
never
become
applicable
on
these
transit
shipments,
where
they
have
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
--
not
set
off
these
sidings
--
sidings
designated
by
the
shipper
where
they're
set
off
by
the
carrier
knowing
what
the
shipper
desires
that
does
not
reach
its
consignment
point
within
a
time
that
a
shipment
would
ordinarily
arrive.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that's
what
they
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
they
are
very
much
in
--
very
much
in
the
case.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
because
they
are
--
these
--
these
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
--
the
findings
of
the
district
court
establish
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
is
this
an
agreement
between
the
carrier
and
a
particular
shipper?
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
the
case
that
we
have
here
now.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
if
the
--
the
if
the
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
they
would
violate
in
our
--
in
our
judgment,
section
6
(7)
and
section
1
of
the
elkins
act
if
the
purpose
of
these
15
stops
was
to
give
the
shipper
a
particular
service
not
specified
in
the
tariff
and
the
service
of
value
to
the
shipper,
whereby
the
transportation
rate
or
--
or
a
rate
less
than
the
published
transportation
rate
was
realized
but
the
carrier.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
15
plan?
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
plant.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
and
these
are
regularly
serviced
by
the
carrier.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
different
case
in
answer
to
both
questions
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
if
these
15
stops
were
for
operational
purposes
insofar
as
the
carrier
is
concerned
and
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
that
or
if
they
are
required
this
service
or
render
a
transportation
service
to
15
communities
in
route.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
would
say,
again,
the
answer
would
be
that
if
it
in
anyway
that
the
service
is
rendered
for
the
convenience
or
the
accommodation
of
the
shipper,
then
in
that
event
it
foul
runs
into
both
section
6
(7)
and
the
elkins
act.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
not
a
demurrage
problem.
that
would
eliminate
the
problem
with
that.
but
we
have
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
there
is
any
question
about
it.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
it's
then
within
the
elkins
act.
it's
for
the
convenience
of
the
shipper.
it's
an
inducement
to
the
shipper
to
use
the
traffic
earlier
to
place
its
traffic
upon
the
--
the
lines
of
the
union
pacific.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
they
--
they
could
do
so,
i
would
say
they
--
the
commission
could
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
that
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
probably,
primarily
to
the
advantage
of
the
big
shippers.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
it
could
approve
--
it
could
approve
the
schedules
proposed
by
the
six
carriers
and
would
determine
that
there
was
no
unjust
discrimination,
undue
advantage
or
preference,
and
that
the
tariff
rates
were
not
unreasonable.
now,
i
think
it
is
significant
in
reference
to
the
pending
commission
proceedings
that
the
nature
of
the
tariffs
that
the
commission
now
has
before
it
filed
by
the
six
other
carriers,
or
in
effect
it
--
exemption
to
the
demurrage
tariffs
that
these
carriers
that
union
pacific
have
on
file.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
the
--
the
proposed
schedules
that
they
have
on
file
with
the
commission
are
now
in
effect
and
have
been
since
june
of
1959.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that's
right,
in
tariff
form
and
of
course
these
schedules
provide
for
a
15-day
free
hold
time
on
lumber
shipments
at
various
points
on
the
carrier's
lines.
they
could
hold
them
up
to
15
days
on
--
on
--
at
--
on
one
carrier,
their
connecting
carriers.
presumably,
they
could
add
another
15
days
at
that
point.
the
--
the
commission
proceedings
or
the
commission's
determination
with
respect
to
the
reasonableness
or
the
lawfulness
of
these
proposed
tariffs
will
not
necessarily
have
any
bearing
or
determination
as
to
the
problem
we
have
here,
insofar
as
the
carrier
may
still
--
if
15
days
isn't
enough
to
suit
the
shippers
needs,
he
may
still
set
the
car
off
at
--
at
sidings
in
order
to
give
him
a
little
--
a
little
more
time.
so
that
even
if
the
commission
were
to
--
to
approve
these
schedules
that
are
before
it,
we
would
still
have
the
problem
here
whether
independently
of
the
tariff
provision,
it
is
unlawful
for
the
carrier,
in
terms
of
section
6
(7)
and
the
elkins
act
to
intentionally
delay
the
shipment
beyond
the
15-day
hold
period
or
the
--
for
purposes
of
the
shipper's
desires.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that's
right.
the
--
these
--
these
six
carriers
filed
their
tariffs
after
the
institution
of
this
proceeding,
and
well,
it
still
on
its
early
stages
in
the
district
court.
and
in
that
connection,
i
point
out
that
the
injunction
which
we
hope
will
go
into
effect
in
this
case
is
--
is
in
effect
only,
unless
and
until
the
union
pacific
files
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
a
tariff
providing
for
this
service
and
naming
the
rates
and
charges
if
any,
for
this
special
service
that
they
render
to
lumber
companies.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes.
that
in
fact
was
what
was
done
with
respect
to
this,
the
tariffs
filed
by
the
six
carriers.
they
were
suspended
but
when
there
was
no
permission
or
termination
before
the
expiration
of
the
period
of
suspension,
then
the
tariffs
became
operative.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
would
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
if
--
if
it
were
held
at
that
point
for
--
for
12
days,
then
according
to
the
tariffs
that
then
beyond
12-day
period,
your
demurrage
tariff
would
become
applicable.
then
but
to
answer
your
question,
if
they
move
it
out
of
ogden
into
a
terminal
somewhere
along
the
way
and
set
it
off
there
for
another
five
days
and
that
terminal
was
not
named
as
a
free
time
hold
point,
then
we
have
the
problem
that
we've
got
here.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
the
--
the
point
of
fact,
present
tariffs
before
the
commission
do
not,
as
i
understand
and
so
provide.
so
that
i
would
rather
say,
depending
on
the
number
of
carriers
involved,
conceivably,
you
could
have
had
four,
five,
15-day
hold
period
then
in
the
movement
from
the
point
of
origin
to
the
point
of
final
consignment.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
contrary
to
its
existing
tariff,
i
think,
quite
clearly
not.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes.
i
think,
that
--
that
the
--
the
fact
that
it
is
required
or
that
the
law
requires
that
it
--
that
the
publication
of
a
tariff
is
so
that
it
will
be
open
and
available
to
all
and
that
the
possibility,
even
the
possibility
of
such
private
agreement
between
carrier
and
shipper
as
you
described
it,
this
cannot
exist.
and,
of
course
well,
that
was
reasonably
plain
from
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
elkins
act
some
--
some
--
coming
some
16
years
later.
it
was
to
further
arm
the
commission
with
the
criminal
sanctions
that
appear
in
section
1
of
the
elkins
act.
and
at
the
same
time,
of
course,
congress
made
provisions
whereby
the
courts
could
be
invoked
to
put
an
end
and
a
summary
end
to
discriminations
or
practices,
whereby
railroad
transport
property
at
less
than
its
existing
tariff
rates.
that
i
think
appropriately
brings
me
to
the
question
with
respect
to
the
primary
jurisdiction
that
of
course
was
raised
in
the
district
court
after
the
commission
undertook
its
investigation
of
the
tariffs
filed
by
the
six
other
carriers
and
the
point
that
was
made
to
the
district
court.
well,
that
having
undertaken
this
investigation,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
superseded
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
by
that
court.
at
this
point,
the
case
was
at
the
answer
stage,
would
be
futile
and
useless.
and
that
for
that
reason,
the
court
should
dismiss
the
government's
complaint
and
let
the
commission
go
forward
with
the
problem.
our
answers
to
that
are,
first,
that
as
i've
already
indicated,
that
the
union
pacific
of
course
is
not
a
party
to
the
proceedings
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
that
the
issues,
the
questions
that
the
commission
itself
will
resolve
in
the
pending
proceeding
are
totally
different
than
those
that
were
considered
and
determined
by
the
district
court
here.
i
refer
of
course
to
the
fact
the
commission
is
concerned
with
whether
or
not
there
are
undue
advantages
or
preferences
according
to
shippers
who
are
in
a
position
to
take
advantage
of
the
exemptions
embodied
in
the
proposed
tariffs.
and
whether
or
not
the
--
the
practice
that
they
proposed
to
adopt
and
follow
will
be
an
unreasonable
one.
now,
we
are
of
course,
in
this
case,
are
not
in
the
least
concerned
with
whether
given
the
tariff
provision
providing
for
this
type
of
service,
describing
the
privileges
and
facilities
that
are
made
available
to
the
shipper
as
to
whether
they
are
reasonable
or
unreasonable
is
not
a
matter
that
the
district
court
concerned
itself
with.
nor
are
we
concerned
with
whether
or
not
it
is
an
undue
preference
or
an
undue
advantage
accorded
to
particular
shippers.
the
elkins
act,
of
course,
outlaws
any
advantage
and
prohibits
any
concession,
rebate
or
discrimination
whereby
property
is
transported
at
less
than
tariff
rates.
so,
we
have
that
element
to
the
dissimilarity
of
the
issues
in
the
--
in
the
commission
proceeding
and
--
and
the
issues
that
are
before
the
district
court
or
were
before
the
district
court
in
this
elkins
act
proceeding.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
--
the
distinction
must
be
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
commission
may
decide
that
this
is
a
reasonable
or
an
unreasonable
practice.
but
again,
this
issue
of
reasonableness
is
not
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
--
not
a
factor
and
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
certainly
it
--
it
would
satisfy
section
6
(7)
and
that
it
would
be
open
to
--
to
all
that
there
would
be
no
violation.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
of
section
6
(7)
but
i
don't
know.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
follows.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that
if
a
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes.
but
it
could
still
be
a
device
whereby
a
property
is
transported
at
less
than
tariff
rates
and
would
be
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
am
referring
to
--
no
to
the
--
when
i
say
that,
to
the
device
and
the
carrier
imposing
a
delay
beyond
what
the
--
the
tariff
provision
provides
for.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
and
--
and
of
course,
the
--
the
fact
that
the
union
pacific
is
not
before
the
commission
and
the
commission
will
not
decide
whether
or
not
without
a
tariff
provision,
this
sort
of
a
practice
is
afoul
the
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
no.
because,
i
think,
it's
--
the
relief
is
granted
to
other
carriers
then
the
union
pacific
will
be
in
there
at
the
next
day
with
the
tariff
of
its
own.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
to
put
it
the
other
way.
if
the
commission
decides
that
it
is
unreasonable,
then
we
are
still
are
in
the
position
of
the
union
pacific
to
say,
“well,
it's
unreasonable
with
the
tariff.”
but
we
don't
have
such
a
tariff,
but
we've
--
so
we
can
do
the
same,
in
effect,
the
same
thing
without
a
tariff.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
they're
--
they're
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
--
they're
having
it
both
ways.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
am
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
am
saying
that
we
would
have
to
reinstitute
this
proceeding
if
--
if
they
continue
the
practice
that
they
are
presently
engaged
in.
and
we
think
that
because
the
district
court
impose
injunction
here
is
--
is
affecting
only
until
and
unless
the
union
pacific
conforms
to
the
practice
and
the
apparent
recognition
of
the
other
carriers
that
the
court
here
afar
from
invading
on
coaching
upon
the
jurisdiction,
the
primary
jurisdiction
that
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
understand
that.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that
--
that
is
our
answer
to
the
primary
jurisdiction
point.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
of
course
we
are
interested
in
having
the
carriers
abide
by
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that
of
course,
is
the
purpose
of
the
suit
that
was
commenced
at
a
time
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
--
not
only
as
to
union
pacific
but
one
other,
presently
against
one
other
carrier.
and
the
six
proposed
schedules
that
are
now
before
the
commission
came
sometime
later.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
without
violating
any
statute.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
think
that's
a
--
it's
a
fair
statement
of
it
that
they
cannot
do
this
--
their
--
their
present
practice
cannot
be
conducted
under
their
existing
tariffs
and
in
--
within
the
law.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
it's
--
there's
always
been
a
requirement
that
they
state
in
their
tariff
the
privileges
and
facilities
accorded
or
available
to
a
shipper.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
no
timetable.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
or
fast
--
or
fast
train,
but
union
pacific
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
--
there
is
considerably
more
involved
here
than
a
mere
difference
in
timetables
or
operating
schedules.
