whittaker
i
wonder
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
wonder
mr.
laughlin
if
you
would
have
the
same
problem
that's
presented
here
if

tariffs
expressly
provided
for
this
service
and
allowed
a
fix
number
of
free
days?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
still
have
--
if
a
tariff,
if
a
filed
tariff
did
provide
for
a
free
time
at,
say,
ogden,
utah
in
union
pacific
system,
which
is
a
point,
involved
here,
of
12
days.
would
you
still
have
this
problem?
could
they
lay
--
let
the
cars
lie
there
for
four
or
five
more
days
without
violating
that
filed
tariff?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
they
could
--
could
not
so
as
to
tariff
provide
that
they'd
be
allowed
only
so
many
days
as
hold
time
throughout
the
whole
transit.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
question
if
i
may
ask
you.
you
said
--
you
dropped
that
point.
what
would
be
wrong
if
the
carrier
agrees
with
the
shipper
for
making
of
a
fix
number
of
stops
between
chicago
and
san
francisco.
