justice

stewart
mr.
laughlin,
it's
not
entirely
clear
to
me
what
the
--
how
apart
--
apart
you
are.
you
--
you
have
the
two
side
of
the
positions
are,
because
the
appellant
railroad,
as
is
inclusion
of
its
brief,
asked
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
directions
to
dismiss
the
complaint
and
to
remand
the
case
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
full
investigation
of
the
practices
of
all
the
railroads
and
so
on
to
the
end
of
determining
desirable
uniformity
and
fair
competitive
relations
among
all
the
railroads
participating
in
the
roller
lumber
traffic.
and
the
terms
of
the
order
granting
the
injunction
appearing
on
page
225
of
the
record,
orders
this
union
pacific
railroad,
does
it
not,
to
cease
and
desist
from
carrying
on
these
practices
unless
and
until
such
time,
as
there
is
enforced
with
respect
to
this
railroad,
a
tariff
on
file
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
naming
the
rates
and
charges
for
such
privileges.
now,
i
gather
that
the
difference,
the
basic
difference,
is
that
the
appellant
here
says
that
it
can
do
these
things
under
its
existing
tariffs.
justice
potter
stewart
without
violating
any
statute.
and
that
your
position
is
that
perhaps
it
can
do
these
things
under
new
tariffs
and
that
that's
a
matter
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
determine.
but
that
in
any
event,
it
cannot
do
it
under
its
existing
tariffs
without
violating
the
statute.
is
that
the
basic
difference
between
here?
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
right
in
my
understanding
that
tariffs,
during
the
whole
history
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
have
not
traditionally
and
historically
included
any
references
to
the
number
of
stops
or
the
speed
of
the
trains
or
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
how
fast
or
how
slow
they
went.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
correct.
this
is
the
--
this
is
brand
new
so
far
as
that
goes,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
never
been
any
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
any
--
no
timetable,
no
reference
of
any
kind
to
the
--
to
the
speed
whether
it'd
be
a
slow
speed
or
fast
speed.
justice
potter
stewart
or
to
the
number
of
stops.
