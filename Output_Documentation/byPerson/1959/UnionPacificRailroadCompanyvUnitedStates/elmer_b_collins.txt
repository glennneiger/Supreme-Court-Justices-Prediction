mr.
elmer
b.
collins
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
iowa,
a
direct
appeal
from
the
summary
judgment
issued
by
that
court.
the
basis
of
the
summary
judgment
being
as
i
construe
the
court's
decision
that
union
pacific
railroad
company,
appellant
here,
in
furnishing
and
performing
for
shippers,
the
slow
service
or
a
fast
service
or
any
and
all
shippers,
whichever
service
they
elect,
without
any
tariff
specification
or
publication
of
either
type
of
service,
necessarily
violates
the
interstate
commerce
act,
section
6,
paragraph
7
and
section
1
of
the
elkins
act
in
furnishing
the
slow
service.
the
court
then
issued
an
injunction
enjoining
the
union
pacific
from
performing
the
slow
service
without
tariff
publication
or
unless
and
until
the
railroad
had
a
tariff
lawfully
on
file
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
specifying
the
slow
service
or
offering
in
published
tariff
form
the
slow
service,
but
of
course
not
the
fast
service,
and
specify
an
additional
or
extra
charge
for
the
slow
service.
now
we
will
discuss
two
propositions
or
contentions.
first
that
the
furnishing
of
either
a
fast
or
a
slow
service
by
a
railroad,
and
in
this
case
union
pacific
in
particular,
does
not
without
tariff
publication
which
is
never
been
required,
which
is
not
expressly
required
by
statute
or
by
any
rule,
order
or
regulation
issued
by
the
commission.
furnished
both
or
either,
a
slow
or
a
fast
service
of
the
same
published
tariff
rate,
under
those
circumstances,
does
not
violate
either
the
interstate
commerce
act
or
the
elkins
act.
i
further
contend
that
if
there
is
anything
wrong,
however,
in
such
furnishing
of
service
without
extra
charge
for
the
one
service
or
tariff
publication
for
the
one
service,
then
it
involves
matters
that
are
so
purely
administrative.
that
they
belong
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
should
be
dealt
with
by
that
commission
instead
of
trying
to
cure
the
problem,
which
i
will
shortly
explain
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
the
district
court
--
what
was
your
question
please?
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
it
does
a
very
curious
thing.
the
--
the
holding
of
the
court,
the
conclusions
of
law
of
the
district
court
are
flatly
to
the
effect
that
the
slow
service
violates
the
elkins
act
and
section
6
(7)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
court
then
after
making
those
flat
conclusions
of
law,
which
one
would
think
would
completely
nullify
the
slow
service,
as
the
court
believe
what
it
was
saying,
nevertheless,
issues
an
injunction
which
says
that
“you're
enjoined
from
performing
a
slow
service
unless
you
file
a
tariff
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
have
it
lawfully
on
file
there
specifying
the
slow
service
and
naming
special
charge
for
it.”
the
court,
however,
refused
to
dismiss
the
complaint
and
remand
this
matter
to
the
commission,
so
we
can
have
a
doubt
there
with
all
other
railroads
that
performed
both
slow
and
fast
service.
now,
i'd
like
to
have
this
map,
these
maps
brought
in
here
in
the
hope
that
you
can
at
least
see
the
black
line
from
the
bench.
the
maps
are
in
the
record
in
this
sad
looking
form
and
they
require
--
require
quite
a
bit
of
doing
to
unfold
them.
they
can
be
unfolded
and
examined
closely.
i
want
to
give
you
the
background
of
this
whole
situation.
(inaudible)
if
it
is
possible
for
you
to
see
these
black
lines
on
the
--
well
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
that's
--
that's
--
that
puts
the
case
in
its
true
light
if
we
can
--
even
if
you
we
can't
see
them,
i'll
explain
it
[laughs]
by
pointing
to
the
northwest
corner
in
the
map.
there,
i
should
say
first
that
we
have
always
had
in
the
railroad
business
what
is
called
“roller
traffic”.
that's
the
traffic
that
originates
at
its
point
of
production.
the
producer
knows
no
buyer,
but
he
knows
the
general
area
within
which
he
generally
finds
the
customer.
so
he
turns
it
over
the
railroad
and
started
rolling,
as
we
call
it,
and
then
transfer
a
buyer
while
it's
in
--
it's
moving
for
its
destination.
that
is
a
practice
that
is
as
old
as
railroads
themselves.
if
he
finds
a
buyer,
he
reconciles
the
carload
or
carloads
to
the
new
found
customer.
this
case
involves
lumber
roller
traffic
and
the
mills
are
in
the
northwest
or
even
in
california.
there
are
all
of
these
mill
lumber
rates
from
that
territory
to
the
east.
about
1930,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
two
decisions
lifted
or
gave
the
long
routes
which
are
shown
here
in
black
down
to
texas
and
to
the
--
through
--
well
through
el
paso,
through
denver,
allowing
the
longer
routes
to
participate
at
the
same
purpose
tariff
rates
on
lumber,
which
applied
over
the
direct
routes,
and
i
am
pointing
right
through
the
center
of
the
(inaudible),
which
is
the
line
of
the
union
pacific
in
red
towards
chicago.
the
--
by
allowing
the
same
rates
to
apply
over
the
very
long
routes
and
some
of
them
are
4400
miles
long
as
compared
with
the
direct
union
pacific
routes
or
the
routes
in
which
the
union
pacific
participates
are
2200
miles.
roller
lumber
naturally
went
to
these
long
routes
that
the
commission
made
the
statutory
adjustment
to
enable
them
to
haul
that
traffic.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
no,
the
--
the
roller
service
was
not
considered
in
the
decision.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
because
the
long
routes
wanted
to
participate
in
--
in
any
and
all
traffic
that
they
could
get
over
their
long
routes,
when
the
roller
traffic
developed
at
the
world
war
ii
among
a
few
small
businessmen
in
the
northwest.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
not
in
particular,
no.
but
it
was
done
for
any
type
of
lumber.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
because
the
--
the
railroads
wanted
to
get
the
traffic
over
the
routes
in
for
residents.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
the
--
the
tariffs
--
what
the
commission's
decision
amounted
to
was
permission
for
the
long
routes,
these
shown
in
black,
to
become
parties
to
the
same
tariff
and
rates
that
were
already
in
existence
over
the
shorter
routes.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i
mean
when
the
roller
traffic
--
lumbar
tariff
developed
while
its
natural
drift
was
to
these
longer
routes
because
they
wanted
more
time
in
transit.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
i
haven't
examined
the
tariffs
at
such
but
i'm
positive
that
there
was
no
such
provision
in
the
tariff.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
the
tariffs
don't
specify
and
the
law
does
not
require
tariffs
to
specify
the
type
of
character
or
quantum
of
service
that
will
be
performed
for
published
tariff
rates.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
that's
now
what
this
record
shows.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
if
you
will
look
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
if
you
will
look
at
the
--
the
record
beginning
at
page
134
and
continuing
on
for
several
pages
ending
at
page
--
with
the
--
with
the
schedule
at
page
141
of
the
record,
you
will
see
what
the
union
pacific
offered
to
the
shippers.
now,
that
is
a
slow
service
compared
to
the
fast
service
and
it
necessarily
involves
slow
handling
and
breaking
up
a
train
at
one
division
point
and
later
putting
it
together
and
--
and
sending
it
on
to
a
--
a
further
division
point.
it
involves
more
handling
than
the
fast
service.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
in
the
--
in
the
first
place,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
union
pacific
and
the
other
numerous
railroads
that
form
these
direct
short
routes
in
order
to
compete
and
avoid
being
excluded
from
the
roller
lumber
traffic
had
offered
this
slow
service.
they
wanted
to
make
revenues
from
hauling
the
traffic.
now,
they
offered
it
to
the
shippers
who
--
who
wanted
it
whether
they
were
little
businessmen
as
in
the
case
here
or
big
businessmen
who
complain
the
--
the
practices
of
the
little
businessmen
and
wanted
to
put
them
out
of
business.
the
railroads
want
the
traffic.
the
direct
lines
want
to
compete
with
the
long
lines
and
they
made
this
offer
of
slow
service
which
we
have
done,
the
union
pacific,
for
years.
we
have
done
it
on
california
perishables.
we
have
done
it
on
idaho
potatoes,
that
they're
offering
the
service
for
at
least
30
years,
and
this
is
the
first
time
the
commission
has
object
to
it.
now,
it's
true.
the
big
lumber
shippers
as
well
as
the
small
lumber
shippers
may
have
either
the
slow
service
or
the
fast
service.
and
the
commission
says
that
the
fact
that
we
offer
it
to
all
alike,
makes
no
difference,
that
because
the
slow
service
is
of
some
benefit
and
they
figure
out
maybe
a
$100
which
they
say
is
a
demerits
saving
to
the
--
to
the
one,
who
today,
accepts
the
slow
service,
but
tomorrow
may
want
the
faster
service.
that
by
his
acceptance
of
slow
service
today,
he
--
he
gains
the
possibility
of
avoiding
the
demerits
charges
at
destination.
perhaps,
our
slow
service
is
unlawful
and
i
call
your
attention
to
a
calculation
made
in
the
union
pacific's
brief.
it
was
--
it's
a
result
of
a
calculation,
but
by
the
--
a
formula
at
the
bottom
of
page
12,
the
formula
is
identified,
entitle
rail
carload
cost
scales
by
territories
and
published
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
all
these
long
securities
routes
using
the
commission's
cost
formula,
that
cost
$1,400
approximately
of
railroad
cost
services
which
the
shipper
gets,
including
probably
twice
as
much
time
to
find
a
buyer,
while
it
costs
only
$700
approximately
in
actual
transportation
effort
and
cost
over
our
direct
routes.
well,
the
shipper
can
have
either.
and
we
are
not
doing
this
to
give
the
shipper
something
that
he
can't
get
even
in
greater
measure
elsewhere,
that
is
all
the
long
routes.
now,
the
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
no,
no.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
no,
i
said
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i
said
that
the
--
or
may
i
restate
it
perhaps
in
better
language
than
i
did.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
yes.
section
6
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
requires
railroads
to
publish
tariffs
of
their
rates
and
charges
for
their
services.
it
goes
on
to
say
that
they
shall
publish
privileges
and
facilities
affecting
the
application
or
cost
of
transportation
but
it
says
nothing
and
neither
does
any
--
pardon
me.
the
--
the
section
further
provides
that
we
shall
not
only
publish
all
rates
and
charges
covering
our
services
but
that
we
shall
publish
all
other
charges
proscribed
by
the
commission.
the
commission
has
never
told
us
what
other
charges
to
publish.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
yes.
those
are
specific
things
go
in
the
tariffs.
we
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
if
we
--
if
we
publish
transit
privileges
where
they
are
--
we
could
stop
and
they
can
mill
their
corn
and
ship
it
on.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
because
it's
specified
in
the
tariffs,
that's
right,
--
in
the
statute.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
all
other
charges
required
by
the
commission.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
that's
right.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
the
whole
thing
is
completely
in
the
hands
of
the
commission.
and
instead
of
--
instead
of
issuing
an
order
or
holding
a
hearing
as
it
should
to
develop
the
facts
and
determine
maybe
whether
it
wants
to
go
back
again
to
the
first
of
the
two
decisions
which
it
rendered,
and
they
are
cited
in
the
brief,
commodity
rates
on
lumber
and
other
forest
products.
in
the
first
decision,
the
commission
said,
“well
we'll
give
the
carriers
relief,
the
long
routes
relief
from
section
4.
but
we'll
put
a
security
limitation.
we'll
--
we'll
allow
only
those
routes
that
--
to
participate
at
the
same
rates
which
routes
are
only
33%
longer
than
the
direct
routes.”
well,
then
came
the
further,
or
reconsideration
by
the
commission
of
the
same
decision,
they
wiped
out
the
security
limitation
which
in
effect,
so
far
as
roller
traffic
which
is
a
very
large
segment
of
the
traffic
in
this
country
excludes
roller
traffic
from
moving
over
the
direct
routes.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
no.
they
only
approve
proposals
of
the
routes
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
--
applying
for
relief.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
the
--
the
specification,
whatever
specifications
or
limitations
are
contained
in
the
tariffs
that
are
offered
to
the
commission
in
connection
with
which
relief
is
asked.
so
it
would
vary
from
one
set
of
tariffs
to
another
that
were
offered.
and
it
happens
that
these
lumber
tariffs
are
wide
open
as
the
--
the
routes
are
--
are
literally
thousands
and
the
shippers
who
want
additional
time
can
keep
on
routing
and
backhauling
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
over
the
securities
routes.
now,
i
--
i
contend
that
our
furnishing
of
slow
service
without
tariff
publication
and
there
is
no
tariff
publication
for
any
kind
of
service.
so
i
have
said
the
law
doesn't
require
--
does
not
and
without
an
extra
charge,
does
not
violate
the
interstate
commerce
act
nor
the
elkins
act.
first,
because
there's
nothing
expressly
in
the
law
requiring
us
to
publish
tariffs
or
to
haul
no
traffic
faster
than
another
roller
traffic.
there's
no
order,
rule
or
regulation
require
of
the
commission,
no
exercise
of
the
commission's
vast
powers
under
the
section
6
to
control
this
situation.
and
finally,
by
offering
this
service,
the
two
services,
to
all
shippers
for
the
same
rate,
avoids
any
discrimination
or
any
possibility
of
discrimination
unless
we
are
to
the
point
now
where
we
are
obliged
to
conclude
that
because
a
man
takes
a
carload
service
today,
he
--
just
for
illustration,
he
discriminates
against
himself
for
not
taking
a
less
than
carload
service
or
if
he
fix
the
car
--
less
than
car
load
which
is
hired.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
yes;
yes.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
yes,
that's
the
case.
i
say
this
that
the
situation
here
is
practically
identical
to
the
one
this
court
dealt
with
in
the
cunard
navigation
case
where
it
was
two
rates,
the
dual
rate,
instead
of
dual
services
offered
for
the
same
work.
and
again
in
the
far
east
case
in
which
the
government
itself
brought
a
suit
for
injunction,
and
in
both
cases,
this
court
said,
“well,
you've
got
a
problem
over
which
the
courts
have
jurisdiction
and
authority
to
issue
an
injunction.
but
the
subject
matter
of
the
suit,
although
antitrust
violations
are
clearly
alleged,
then
you
would
be
entitled
to
relief
which
we
have
authority
to
a
grant.”
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
the
--
the
opinion
in
the
(inaudible)
case
clearly
says
that
it
makes
no
--
it
does
not
affect
and
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
principle
of
your
decisions
in
the
far
east
and
in
the
--
the
cunard
case
and
oblige
to
take
what
(inaudible)
opinion
says
as
to
respect.
so
the
way
is
open
to
you
to
refer
this
matter
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
so
that
the
commission
may
investigate
the
whole
subject
and
not
try
to
cure
it
by
cutting
the
union
pacific
out
through
injunctional
processes.
the
situation
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
he
didn't
do
that
but
he
--
he
tried
to
do
it
in
effect.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
yes,
i
think
in
--
in
substance
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
no.
he
said
unless
the
commission
excuses
from
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
after
finding
that
we're
in
flatly
in
violation
of
the
law,
now,
we
don't
want
to
file
the
tariff
of
schedules
and
pre-insert
this.
we
have
never
done
it
in
the
setting
of
three
years
of
the
history
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
commission
has
never
required
us
to
do
it.
there
are
hundreds
of
practical
reasons
why
railroads
can't
file
operating
schedules
or
quantum
of
service
specifications
in
the
tariffs
which
change
from
day
to
day.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
i
am
saying
that
--
leave
us
alone
if
--
unless
you
find
something
wrong.
we
don't
want
to
go
any
place
except
more
than
the
destination
with
our
traffics.
but
if
somebody
finds
fault
with
us
for
what
we
were
doing,
then
we
think
the
--
the
solution
is
not
a
judicial
problem
but
an
icc
problem.
i
want
to
reserve
five
minutes.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
your
honors,
all
these
reasons
just
recited
by
counsel
for
escaping
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
were
purged
in
the
cunar
and
the
far
east
cases
and
were
rejected
by
this
court.
it's
not
a
simple
matter.
this
case
is
--
doesn't
present
the
simple
question
of
us
filing
a
tariff
with
the
commission
and
knowing
that
the
commission
will
take
it
out
like
it
has
up
to
date
this
tariffs
of
the
six
railroads.
while
we
don't
ask
for
a
hold
service,
we
don't
offer
a
15-day
free
hold
service,
we
offer
a
slow
railroad
service
just
like
we
used
to
on
the
go,
of
course,
limited
from
chicago
to
san
francisco,
58
hours
or
39
hours
for
the
same
price
on
the
city
of
san
francisco.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i
--
i
think
--
i'll
have
to
disagree
with
you,
sir.[laughs]
you
--
you're
a
man
who
likes
to
get
around
the
world
in
a
hurry
[laughs]
but
a
lot
of
people
like
to
go
slow
and
a
lot
of
traffic
moves
slow.[laughter]
the
--
you'd
be
amazed
that
the
number
of
people
who
--
who
picked
and
choose
between
three
types
of
service,
passenger
service,
same
pullman
fare,
same
railroad
fare.
now,
the
whimsicalities
of
the
public
cannot
be
overlooked
if
you're
tying
to
operate
a
common
carrier.
the
needs
of
the
shipping
public
can't
be
overlooked.
so
where
--
but
while
the
pendency
of
the
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
--
is
not
the
solution
that
i
asked
for,
as
you
just
referred
to,
mr.
justice.
so,
i
want
the
commission,
and
the
union
pacific
wants
the
commission,
to
stop
piecemealing
and
biting
off
bits
of
this
problem
and
saying
to
me,
“now,
you
come
and
file
a
tariff
with
the
commission
and
we'll
kick
it
out,
that
will
be
a
view
of
justice.”
it
said
that
to
these
other
six
railroad
but
it's
now
reopened
them
for
reconsideration.
but
they
held
at
their
tariffs
providing
for
15-day
hold
service
is
unreasonable.
i
say
to
this
court
that
the
only
question
involved
in
what
union
pacific
is
doing
actually
is
whether
or
not
the
freight
rate
we
collect
is
reasonable
for
either
or
both,
a
slow
service
or
a
fast
service.
and
we
don't
have
to
publish
the
type
of
service
in
the
tariff
because
the
law
doesn't
say
so
expressly
and
neither
does
the
commission.
i
have
set
forth
in
the
union
pacific's
brief
a
rather
nasty
little
accusation
against
the
commission,
which
i
dislike
to
make
but
it's
the
truth
that
they
have
piecemealed
this
--
their
dealing
with
this
thing.
at
first,
they
--
they
opened
up
additional
securities
routes,
then
they
--
they
issued
order
9,
10
which
stopped
anything
but
the
fastest
service
that
a
shipper
could
--
the
railroad
could
give.
and
they've
done
the
other
thing
that
i've
recited
in
their
brief
and
then
i
quote
from
former
justice
--
the
late
cardozo's
observations
of
--
of
--
and
basis
on
which
he
repulse
the
commission
for
piecemealing
and
putting
off
until
tomorrow
the
work
it
should
do
today.
now,
if
there
anything
wrong
in
what
we
are
doing,
let's
have
it
out
before
the
one
tribunal
that
has
the
authority
to
apply,
to
cover
the
whole
situation
and
provide
uniformity
of
practices
among
the
carriers,
readjust
between
the
securities
routes
and
the
direct
routes
so
that
none
of
us
would
be
starved
out
of
this
traffic.
the
commission
has
full
investigative
power
and
if
anybody
is
dissatisfied
of
what
it
does,
we
will
then
--
can
get
judicial
review
of
whatever
it
says
if
we
feel
that
that's
necessary.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
we
filed
the
rates.
they've
been
on
file
for
years.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
you
mean
file
a
rate,
a
--
a
tariff
charging
more
for
the
slow
service?
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
myes,
we
have.
we
have
a
published
tariff
rate
for
all
lumber
service
over
from
the
northwest
to
eastern
markets
but
in
no
tariff,
publishing
a
rate
will
you
find
anywhere
in
the
specification
of
the
time
that
it
will
take
in
transportation,
but
we
collect
the
tariff
rate.
what
the
government
is
telling
us
to
do
that
you
can't
run
one
train
slower
than
another
or
one
shipment
slower
than
another
unless
you
charge
more
than
you
charge
for
your
fast
service.
now,
they
support
that
contention
by
saying
that
your
fast
service
is
standard.
the
act
doesn't
say
what
standard
in
the
way
of
service.
the
lower
court
said
intentional.
the
act
doesn't
say
intentional
slow
service
is
unlawful.
that's
the
commission's
own
conclusion
or
the
conclusion
of
the
lawyers
to
rule
this
complaint.
they
have
adopted
and
invented
standards
which
neither
interstate
commerce
act
and
nor
the
elkins
act
provide.
they've
invented
their
own
standards
to
try
drive
against
us
a
violation
of
the
elkins
act,
where
as
a
mater
of
fact,
it's
the
commission's
duty
to
investigate
the
whole
thing
and
not
just
the
union
pacific.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
they
are
not
the
kind
of
findings
the
commission
not
to
make.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
perhaps
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
exactly.
at
page
13
of
my
brief,
i
quote
some
of
the
things
that
--
that
moved
apparently,
the
district
court
to
conclude
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
elkins
act
here.
he
says
that
the
slow
service
can
trip
the
use
of
truckage
and
cars
to
provide
a
storage
facility
for
transit
lumber
shippers.
well,
every
time
we
furnished
a
car
or
used
or
trucks
or
an
engine
or
any
of
our
transportation
property,
we
are
furnishing
just
what
he's
accused
of
doing
there
with
our
slow
service.
we
do
it
for
the
fast
service,
we
are
required
to
furnish
those
things
for
the
published
tariff
rate.
now,
he
says
further,
it
puts
--
added
an
operational
problems
in
cost
fluctuations.
in
the
kirby
case,
the
horse
case,
that
the
government
relies
on
them
very
fully,
the
time
serviced
was
the
normal
--
was
--
was
not
the
normal,
but
was
an
intentional
service
to
one
shipper
or
one
carload
of
horses
and
it
was
branded,
the
fast
service,
mind
you,
which
they
here
say
is
normal,
was
branded
in
that
case,
and
held
by
this
court
to
be
in
violation
of
the
act.
so
what
is
our
standard,
what
--
what
must
we
do
unless
the
government
itself
is
going
to
say
how
many
times
they
can
stop
a
train
or
how
slowly
move
the
traffic.
the
court
goes
ahead
and
decides
questions
that
are
clearly
within
the
commission's
administrative
functions,
says
that,
“we
--
we
suffer
excessive
per
diem
cost
for
use
of
foreign
cars
while
these
long
routes
down
through
texas
do
the
same
thing
and
much
more
so,
that
we
also
have
it
--
the
service
also
has
a
tendency
to
unbalance
dependence,
annual
per
diem
offsets
and
it
enables
roller
lumber
dealers
to
a
hard
payment
demurrage.
and
it
also
puts
the”
--
he
says,
“puts
the
slow
lumber
shipper
in
a
better
competitive
position
in
the
market.”
well,
if
it
isn't
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
duty
to
decide
whether
this
rate
is
reasonable
for
both
services
or
whether
this
slow
service
unduly
advantages
the
competitive
situation
of
the
slow
lumber
shipper,
i
can't
imagine
what
the
commission's
function
is,
and
i
thank
you.
