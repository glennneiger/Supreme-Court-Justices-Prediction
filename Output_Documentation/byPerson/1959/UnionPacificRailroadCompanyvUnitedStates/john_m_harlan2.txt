justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
district
court's
decision,
mr.
collins,
affect
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
question
was
whether
the
decision
of
the
district
court
affected
in
any
way
the
primary
jurisdiction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
collins,
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
had
issued
a
temporary
injunction
and
said
--
in
this
kind
of
a
permission
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
substantially
the
same
thing
as
to
what
they
did
do
though?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you're
--
you're
going
to
get
before
the
commission,
they
didn't
fix
the
rates,
they
didn't
say
you
could
or
couldn't
do
this.
they
said
that
you
simply
could
not
operate
without
specifying
this
new
tariff.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
but
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
you're
asking
is
for
an
opportunity
to
go
to
the
commission.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
your
distinction
was
to
suspend
the
tariff,
i
suppose.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
the
commission
could
suspend
the
--
suspend
the
tariff
or
they
consider
them?
