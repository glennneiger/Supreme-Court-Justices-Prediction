you're
never
sure
of
that.
justice

j.
brennan,

when
we're
sure
of
that
(inaudible)
case
that
would
be
decided
on
the
premise
that
it
wasn't

reversed

but
did
i
understand
mr.
wilkey
that
the
indictment
has
in
fact
been
dismissed
--
the
state
indictment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
what
it
just
meant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
the
--
in
any
event,
this
evidence
could
not
be
used
to
prove
that
effect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(voice

indictment's
dismissed,
how
can
it
be
used?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
wilkey
i
am
looking
at
page
225
of
the
record
where
mr.
lonagan
was
questioned
about
the
dismissal
of
the
wiretap
indictment
and
when
he
was
asked,
"why
did
you
urge
that
the
indictment
be
dismissed,"
at
the
bottom
of
page
225,
his
answer
is,
"for
the
reason
that
the
attorney
general
had
wrongfully
conceded
that
the
evidence
was
seized
illegally,
so
as
to
prevent
a
prosecution
under
the
state
indictment."
what's
that
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
am
i
wrong
then
in
--
in
reading
this
as
in
effect
saying
that
was
going
to
use
in
prosecuting
a
state
indictment.
you
couldn't
use
the
illegally
seized
evidence
to
support
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
i'm
correct
in
reading
it
that
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
only
reason
i've
referred
to
this
it
seems
to
me
at
least
this
much
is
to
whatever
may
be
the
state
of
the
law
in
the
oregon
supreme
court
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
the
officers
who
had
charged
prosecuting
these
state
indictments,
dismissed
them
for
the
reason
that
they
thought
the
evidence
having
been
determined
to
be
illegal
seized
could
not
be
used
in
the
oregon
courts
for
said
indictment.
justice

j.
brennan,

it's
all
