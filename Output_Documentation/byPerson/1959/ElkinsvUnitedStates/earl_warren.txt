colonel

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wilkey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
--
what
was
that
executive
order
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wilkey,
it
looks
to
me
that
the
order
of
the
court
goes
a
little
farther
that
you
--
you
have
indicated
here
because
in
the
fourth
--
in
the
fourth
or
the
third
full
paragraph,
the
court
says,
"it
is
further
ordered
and
adjudged
said
search
warrant
should
be
and
this
held
be
in
all
affects
in
nullity
and
then
the
article
seized
under
the
said
search
warrant,
were
improperly
so
seized
and
should
be
suppressed
as
evidence.”
then
--
then
let
me
go
on
please,
“then
he
goes
on
to
--
to
make
particular
disposition
of
certain
--
certain
articles
that
were
taken
because
of
certain
special
situations
and
the
first
one
was
that
of
course
the
slot
machines
are
contraband,
it
can't
be
used
by
anybody,
so
we
destroyed
it.”
now,
if
he
did
--
if
he
hasn't
suppressed
it,
hasn't
suppressed
his
inquire
why
would
he
have
destroyed
that?
then
secondly,
because
of
this
executive
order
from
the
governor
the
state
of
oregon
as
you
say
transferring
everything
to
the
--
to
another
officer,
they
hold
that
--
that
these
matters
that
are
under
discussion
here,
shall
be
turned
over
to
the
attorney
general
to
be
--
i
see,
to
be
disposed
of
legally
and
then
the
third
and
last
--
last
disposition
is
that
anyone
who
has
any
copies
or
recordings
of
the
seized
property
shall
surrender
to
--
to
the
sheriff.
now,
that's
getting
awfully
close
to
a
suppression,
if
isn't
a
suppression
where
he
says
it's
no,
a
nullity
and
any
article
seized
under
the
search
warrant
were
--
were
improperly
so
seized
should
be
suppressed
as
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
what
more
should
he
have
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
you
said
that
the
next
and
last
paragraph
on
page
24
that
which
i
just
referred
to,
did
include
that
because
in
furtherance
of
the
executive
order
from
the
governor,
those
things
were
to
be
impounded
with
the
attorney
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
the
whole,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
doesn't
say
that
any
--
any
articles
that
were
listed
there.
he
says
it
is
further
ordered
and
the
judge
said,
"search
warrants
should
be
and
is
held
to
be
in
all
affects,
a
nullity
and
any
articles
seized
under
the
search
warrant
were
improperly
so
seized
and
should
be
suppressed
as
evidence."
now,
that
--
that
seems
to
me
is
all
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
see
--
i
see
your
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
26
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
we
might
as
well
recess
now,
before
you
start
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
james
butler
elkins
and
raymond
frederick
clark,
petitioners,
versus
united
states.
mr.
wilkey,
you
may
continue
your
arguments.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wilkey,
before
you
--
before
you
get
into
your
argument,
well,
this
--
will
you
include
in
it
the
question
as
to
whether
this
was
sufficient
constitutionally
under
federal
law.
you
are
going
--
yesterday
you
said
you
were
going
to
discuss
that.
as
i
--
as
i
understood
you,
you
weren't
going
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
under
state
law,
it
was
--
the
affidavit
was
sufficient.
you
said
you
felt
that
under
federal
law,
it
was
and
that
you
would
discuss
it,
will
--
will
you
get
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
thank
you.
that's
all
i
want
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
--
in
your
own
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
relevancy
of
the
manner
in
which
mr.
langley
was
convicted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
couldn't
you
just
as
well
parade
some
horribles
on
the
other
side?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
would
--
that
would
point
to
the
other
policy
and
maybe
you
could
point
also
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
langley
here
to
the
effect
that
what
he
was
after
was
to
try
to
put
--
put
this
man
away
for
life
and
he
didn't
care
how
he
did
it
then
he
proposed
to
--
to
violate
the
--
violate
the
law
in
order
to
accomplish
that
result.
now,
isn't
that
as
much
of
a
horrible
as
the
one
that
you
--
you
profess
to
us
here
and
wouldn't
that
lead
to
an
opposite
conclusion
for
the
one
you
argue
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
really,
i
don't
see
the
relevancy
of
it.
is
there
any
objection
to
it,
colonel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
point
raised
below
that
you
make
now?
was
it
--
was
it
argued
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wilkey,
there
maybe
many
other
--
many
factors
that
--
that
you're
not
taking
cognizance
of.
it
may
had
led
to
the
conclusion
in
the
state
courts.
and
should
we
try
that
in
this
court
by
taking
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
records
that
had
never
--
never
been
discussed
or
with
any
of
the
lower
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
leave
the
--
you
may
leave
the
documents
with
our
clerk
and
then
you
may
exchange
memoranda
as
to
--
if
you
wish
as
to
why
we
should
receive
them.
we'll
--
we'll
decide
it
later.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
didn't
--
didn't
herder
--
didn't
herder
state
on
the
witness
stand
though
that
his
--
that
everything
he
stated
was
only
hearsay?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
--
the
affidavit
doesn't
contradict.
all
--
all
the
affidavit
says
that
the
source
of
his
information
was
chief
herder.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wasn't
williams
the
original
complainant
against
--
against
these
men?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
he
the
man
who
dug
up
the
information
and
called
it
to
the
attention
of
the
--
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
who
--
and
who
caused
the
telephone
call
to
be
made
to
herder
as
a
basis
for
the
affidavit
and
who
--
who
got
all
the
information
and
who
urged
langley
to
--
to
have
the
search
warrant
issued?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i'll
give
--
you
may
take
two
more
minutes
and
i'll
give
--
i'll
give
colonel
wiener
approximately
the
same
amount
of
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
colonel,
you
may
have
some
more
minutes,
i'll
give
you
13
minutes
to
conclude.
