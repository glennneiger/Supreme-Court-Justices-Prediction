mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
court
please,
this
is
a
search
and
seizure
case
which
until
10
days
ago
represented
two
principal
issues.
the
first
issue
was
whether
when
state
officers
illegally
seized
evidence
without
any
federal
participation
in
that
seizure,
such
evidence
was
admissible
in
a
federal
prosecution
and
the
second
principal
issue
is
whether
the
rule
of
the
rea
case
in
the
350
u.s.,
was
a
rule
of
comity.
that
was
the
case
which
held,
as
your
honors
will
recall,
that
where
a
federal
court
suppresses
the
results
of
a
search
by
federal
officers,
it
showed
enjoined
those
federal
officers
from
testifying
concerning
that
seizure
in
a
subsequent
state
prosecution
and
this
case
presents
the
converse
of
that
situation
namely,
a
state
court
which
has
suppressed
the
fruits
of
a
state
seizure
whether
that
court
may
enjoin
the
state
officers
who
participated
from
testifying
in
a
subsequent
federal
prosecution
based
on
the
same
evidence.
now,
until
10
days
ago,
those
were
the
only
issues
because
it
was
conceded
at
the
hearing
of
--
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
it
was
conceded
by
the
united
states
attorney
on
the
motion
to
suppress
that
the
state
seizure
had
been
illegal.
i
will
read
from
page
80
of
the
record,
“mr.
lackey,
that's
the
u.s.
attorney
for
the
district
of
oregon,
i
think
we
can
take
the
position,
your
honor,
without
saying
that
we
either
accept
or
disbelieve
that
it
was
or
was
not
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
matter
we
may
treat
it
as
illegal.”
and
then
ten
days
ago
when
the
prosecution's
brief
was
file
here,
that
concession
which
had
never
been
questioned
or
withdrawn
in
any
stage
and
on
the
basis
of
which
an
appeal
was
taken,
certiorari
was
applied
for
and
granted
on
the
record
designated,
the
prosecution
undertakes
to
reargue
that
case,
whether
in
view
of
the
holding
in
abel
decided
today
they
can
do
so,
i
don't
know.
i
shouldn't
think
so
unless,
of
course,
we
have
one
rule
for
concessions
made
by
the
movement
on
motions
to
suppress
and
another
for
the
united
states
attorney.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
and
i
will
try
to
state
them
in
brief
compass
are
these.
the
case
originates
in
may
1956.
one
langley
at
that
time
the
district
attorney
of
multnomah
county,
oregon,
which
includes
the
city
of
portland,
he
has
been
judicially
removed
from
his
convict
in
office,
was
out
to
get
the
petitioner,
elkins,
and
when
i
say,
was
out
to
get,
i
rely
on
record
testimony
by
langley
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
he
wanted
to
get
elkins
on
a
traffic
charge
and
put
him
away
in
the
state
penitentiary
for
life
and
that's
--
i
--
in
the
footnote
on
page
49
of
petitioners'
blue
brief.
in
order
to
get
elkins,
he
struck
at
his
employee,
the
petitioner
clark,
and
he
executed
an
affidavit
on
information
and
belief.
now
on
view
of
the
jones
case
just
decided,
i'd
ask
your
honors
to
look
at
that
affidavit
on
pages
20
and
21
of
the
record.
langley
deposed
an
information
and
belief
that
there
obscene
photographs
with
accompanying
sound
recordings
in
the
home
of
the
petitioner,
clark.
as
your
honors
will
see,
there
was
no
statement
of
any
supporting
evidence.
no
statement
of
any
supporting
information.
langley
said
he
believed
that
clark
had
these
articles
with
intent
to
exhibit
them
in
violation
of
the
state
law
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
source
of
this
information
was
police
chief
herder
of
saint
helens,
oregon,
which
is
a
small
community
about
25
miles
north
of
oregon
and
that
was
all.
there
was
absolutely
no
statement
of
supporting
facts.
herder,
the
chief
of
police
in
saint
helens,
did
not
know
clark,
did
not
know
where
clark
lived,
had
no
knowledge
of
any
obscene
photographs
etcetera
in
the
home
of
clark
and
didn't
know
anything
about
clark
except
what
he
had
been
told
by
others
and
herder
also
said
that
he
had
never
communicated
with
langley.
he
didn't
know
the
man.
he
had
never
conversed
with
him.
as
i
will
show
later,
there
is
a
question
whether
langley
without
betraying
his
presence
listened
in
on
an
extension
phone,
to
a
phone
call
between
herder
and
a
reporter,
but
nothing
turns
on
that.
langley's
position
was
that
since
it
was
information
from
a
police
chief,
it
was
therefore
probable
cause.
at
any
rate,
it
was
either
double
or
triple
hearsay
without
any
statement
of
supporting
facts,
but
on
the
strength
of
that
affidavit,
langley
got
a
search
warrant
from
a
judge
who
as
he
later
admitted,
didn't
read
the
document
too
carefully
and
armed
with
that
search
warrant,
a
raid
was
made
in
the
evening
of
the
17th
of
may,
on
the
home
of
the
petitioner,
clark.
that
raid
was
conducted
by
three
deputy
sheriffs,
two
policemen
in
uniform
and
they
were
accompanied
by
two
reporters
and
one
newspaper
photographer.
and
in
the
evening
of
that
day,
about
8:30
at
night,
they've
broke
in
the
door
of
the
petitioner,
clark's
home,
and
they
made
return
that
they
found
no
obscene
photographs
for
the
accompanying
sound
recordings.
that
was
the
sheriff's
return.
they
did
seize
the
five
electronic
tapes
herein
question.
they
couldn't
tell
what
those
tapes
contained,
if
anything.
there
were
slips
accompanying
those
tapes
which
the
seizing
deputy
did
not
read.
he
didn't
arrest
the
petitioner,
clark,
for
wiretapping
which
is
an
offense
under
oregon
law
and
indeed,
he
left
these
five
electronic
tapes
off
the
list
--
the
receipt
that
he
handed
clark.
he
took
those
tapes
that
night
down
to
the
sheriff's
office
in
the
courthouse
downtown
and
in
the
wee
small
hours,
played
them
back
and
made
copies
of
those
tapes
which
were
duly
published
the
next
paper
--
the
next
morning
i
should
say,
in
the
enterprising
paper,
whose
reporters
had
accompanied
the
raid.
now,
the
17th
was
a
thursday
night.
the
next
three
days
were
non-judicial
days
so
that
it
wasn't
until
monday
morning
that
clark
was
able
to
redress
this
unlawful
search,
which
he
did
by
motion
--
by
a
motion
to
suppress
filed
before
the
very
judge
who
had
issued
the
search
warrant.
now,
while
this
motion
to
suppress
was
pending
in
the
state
district
court
which
is
the
lowest
tribunal
in
the
oregon
hierarchy,
langley
played
these
tapes
to
the
grand
jury,
secured
an
indictment
of
both
petitioners
for
violation
of
the
state
wiretapping
act
and
one
of
the
deputies
sheriffs
played
back
part
of
the
tape
to
an
fbi
agent.
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
in
the
state
district
court,
the
judge
who
have
issued
the
warrant
said
that
if
he'd
look
at
it
properly
and
if
he
hadn't
relied
too
much
on
langley's
integrity
instead
of
his
inspection,
he
would
never
have
issued
it
and
ordered
the
evidence
suppressed
and
ordered
it
placed
in
the
custody
of
the
state
attorney
general,
subject
to
the
further
orders
of
the
courts
and
the
state
--
the
tapes
were
put
into
a
private
bank
in
the
actual
custody
of
the
oregon
state
police.
a
few
months
later,
there
arose
a
question
whether
the
state
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
order
of
suppression
after
the
indictment
had
been
returned
the
state
circuit
court,
which
is
the
court
of
general
criminal
jurisdiction
in
oregon.
the
motion
to
suppress
was
reargued
in
the
state
circuit
court
and
the
state
circuit
court
again,
suppressed
the
evidence
as
illegally
seized
and
ordered
it
held
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state,
subject
to
further
orders
of
the
court.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
wasn't
an
appeal.
it
was
a
--
apparently,
as
nearly
as
i
can
judge
from
the
record,
it
was
a
new
proceeding.
it
was
reargued.
the
only
proceeding
for
bringing
it
up
would
have
been
a
writ
of
review
which
seems
to
have
been
discussed,
but
it
was
actually
argued
de
novo
in
the
state
circuit
court.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
there
is
none
here.
no
--
no
additional
evidence
was
taken.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
in
the
state
circuit
court
--
in
the
oregon
circuit
court.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
because
it's
the
state
circuit
court
which
is
the
court
of
general
criminal
jurisdiction.
now,
while
those
tapes
were
in
the
bank,
they
were
taken
from
the
bank
where
they
were
in
the
constructive
custody
of
the
state
courts,
they
were
taken
under
a
federal
search
warrant
and
a
few
months
later,
the
present
--
federal
indictments
followed
briefly
a
number
of
substantive
counts
for
violation
of
section
605
of
the
communications
act,
the
federal
wiretapping
statute
with
the
inevitable
accompaniment
of
a
conspiracy
count.
petitioners
then
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
in
the
u.s.
district
court
and
they
had
a
four-day
hearing
on
that
motion
and
their
grounds
were
for,
first
that
since
the
matter
had
been
illegally
seized
by
state
officers,
it
was
inadmissible
for
all
purposes
in
the
federal
prosecution.
second
that
the
federal
agent
didn't
have
probable
cause,
third
that
the
federal
agents
and
the
state
officers
had
cooperated
and
fourth
that
the
property
was
in
the
constructive
custody
of
the
state
court
at
the
time
of
seizure
and
therefore,
couldn't
be
reached
by
a
federal
warrant.
a
four-day
hearing
followed.
when
chief
herder
finished
his
testimony
in
which
he
made
it
plain
that
he
knew
nothing
about
the
petitioner,
clark,
and
that
he'd
never,
in
his
life
ever
talked
to
then
district
attorney
langley,
the
u.s.
district
court
leaned
forward
and
asked
the
u.s.
attorney,
“what
is
your
position
on
the
legality
of
this
state
seizure?”
and
the
u.s.
attorney
trying
not
to
impugn
the
legality
of
state
officers
finally
said,
“i
think
that
without
taking
a
position
on
this
that
for
purposes
of
this
matter,
that
is
the
motion
to
suppress,
we
may
treat
it
as
illegal.”
during
and
at
the
close
of
this
four-day
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
the
u.s.
district
judge
made
three
rulings.
first,
he
said
that
the
validity
of
the
federal
search
warrant
was
immaterial
and
he
cut
off
further
proof
on
that.
second,
he
made
a
finding
that
there
was
no
federal
participation
or
complicity
in
the
state
raid
and
third,
he
said
that
under
the
silver
platter
doctrine,
which
is
the
weeks
case,
plus
the
buyer's
dictum,
plus
ballistic
dictum,
it
was
admissible
in
a
federal
prosecution
regardless
of
its
original
illegality
because
of
the
lack
of
federal
participation
and
he
denied
the
motion.
petitioners
then
went
in
--
back
to
the
state
circuit
court
and
got
a
restraining
order,
later
a
preliminary
injunction,
against
the
state
and
county
officers
enjoining
them
from
testifying
in
the
federal
court
as
to
the
circumstances
of
the
illegal
state
seizure
in
which
they
had
participated
and
that
order
was
based
on
the
rea
case
in
the
350
u.s.
and
the
opinion
of
the
state
circuit
court
cited
and
relied
on
the
rea
case.
when
that
order
was
shown,
the
u.s.
district
judge
who
at
that
point
was
trying
the
case,
he
said
it
was
a
nullity
under
the
supremacy
clause
and
he
ordered
the
eight
enjoined
witnesses
to
testify
when
they
were
respectively
called.
seven
of
them
had
been
mentioned
by
name
in
the
state
court
order.
one
recognized
that
he
was
included
within
its
terms.
of
those
eight,
three
had
been
under
the
restraint
before
they
were
subpoenaed
by
for
the
federal
trial,
five
were
subpoenaed
for
the
trial
before
the
restraining
order
issue.
also,
at
the
trial,
the
reels
of
tape,
the
five
reels
of
tape
were
admitted
into
evidence.
the
petitioners
preserved
their
objections,
the
matter
wasn't,
of
course,
reargued,
but
there
was
no
waiver.
at
the
end
of
a
long
trial
which
included
night
and
saturday
sessions,
petitioners
were
convicted.
now,
following
the
close
of
the
evidence
in
their
federal
trial,
they
went
back
into
the
state
circuit
court
and
instituted
contempt
proceedings
against
the
state
and
county
officials
who
had
violated
the
order
of
the
state
court
by
testifying
and
the
united
states
attorney
countered
with
an
injunction
against
petitioners
from
further
pursuing
those
contempt
proceedings.
in
due
course,
the
conviction
was
appealed
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
that
on
the
ground
of
the
silver
platter
doctrine
which
is
the
same
issue
that's
also
in
rios,
no.
52,
which
follows
this
case
on
argument.
now
those
are
the
facts
in
essential
outline.
the
first
question
logically
is,
was
the
state
search
and
seizure
illegal?
the
united
states
attorney
conceded
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
that
it
was
illegal.
and
i
think
that
if
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
what's
that?
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
matter,
we
may
feed
it
as
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
as
illegal.
and
the
entire
trial
proceeded
on
that
basis
that
concession
wasn't
withdrawn
at
the
subsequent
hearings
on
the
motion.
it
wasn't
withdrawn
at
the
trial.
it
wasn't
withdrawn
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
wasn't
withdrawn
until
10
days
ago.
and
i
think
that
if
the
abel
case
decides
anything,
it
decides
that
is
now
too
late
to
try
to
wiggle
out
of
that.
but
if
the
question
is
still
open
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
thought
that
that
was
the
one
point
on
which
everybody
agreed
and
that
what
they
disagreed
on
was
the
consequences
of
the
concession
that
the
arrest
was
legal.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
very
well,
if
it's
going
to
be
considered,
then
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
the
united
states
attorney's
concession
was
well
founded,
because
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
court
of
appeals
cited
rios
and
said
it
was
immaterial.
in
rios
they
said
that
the
silver
platter
doctrine
only
comes
into
play
when
the
state
seizure
is
illegal.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
i'm
perfectly
prepared
to
argue
the
legality
of
it
and
there
i
will
invoke
the
jones
case.
now,
the
facts
were
that
langley
set
forth
no
supporting
facts.
he
said
on
information
and
belief,
clark
has
the
--
these
articles,
the
source
of
my
information
is
chief
herder.
chief
herder
knew
absolutely
nothing
in
the
world
about
it,
except
what
he
had
been
told.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
was
a
state
court
warrant
so
far
as
i'm
going
to
show
that
it
was
illegal
under
state
law
and
that
was
illegal
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
oregon
courts
only
purported
to
decide
state
law.
they
said
it
was
illegal
under
state
law
because
under
the
law
of
oregon,
you
cannot
issue
a
search
warrant
on
information
and
belief.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
don't
rest
on
the
oregon
determinations
because
the
prosecution
now
relies
on
a
later
oregon
case
which
didn't
deal
with
a
search
warrant
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
there
were
--
there
were
two
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
two
such
adjudications.
there
were
two
such
adjudications
and
i
will
go
farther.
and
i
will
say
that
if
oregon
had
attempted
to
hold
the
warrant
good,
it
would've
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
would
be
very
happy
if
your
honors
didn't
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
because
it
will
simplify
my
task.
the
only
reason
i
have
is
that
the
prosecution
is
trying
to
open
it
up.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
all
right,
i'll
--
i'll
go
ahead.
i
think
it's
perfectly
plain
that
under
oregon
law,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
under
the
fourth
amendment,
the
jones
case,
this
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
because
the
affidavit
was
worthless.
there
were
no
facts
stated
in
it.
it
was
based
on
probably
treble
hearsay
or
if
you
believe
that
langley,
the
district
attorney
in
a
county
of
some
400,000
people,
didn't
communicate
directly
with
the
county
chief
of
police,
25
miles
away
by
calling
him,
but
only
did
so
by
listening
in
unbeknownst
to
the
police
chief
on
a
call
made
by
a
police
reporter.
if
your
honors
will
believe
that,
then
we're
down
to
only
double
hearsay,
still
without
any
statement
of
supporting
facts
and
that
was
an
illegal
search
and
an
illegal
seizure
and
the
people
in
there
were
not
only
trespassers,
but
since
they
broke
and
entered
a
dwelling
house
in
the
night
time
with
intent
to
take
and
carry
away
personal
property,
then
if
my
memory
of
criminal
common
law,
crimes
doesn't
dessert
me,
they
were
burglars
as
well
as
trespassers.
and
since
they
were
not
lawfully
in
the
premises,
we
don't
have
to
go
into
the
question
of
what
they
could
property
have
seized
which
was
the
point
on
which
the
--
your
honors
divided
this
morning
in
the
abel
case
because
the
basis
of
harris
and
rabinowitz,
of
course,
is
that
the
people
are
lawfully
on
the
premises.
these
people
were
not
lawfully
on
the
premises.
so
we
say
it
was
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
in
violation
of
state
law,
in
violation
therefore,
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
since
there
was
no
federal
participation
and
we
don't
question
those
findings,
since
there
was
no
federal
participation,
we
reach
what
i
deem
to
be
the
basic
question
here
and
i
think
ultimately,
the
only
question
namely
the
continued
validity
of
what
due
to
an
expression
in
the
lustig
case
has
been
become
known
as
the
silver
platter
doctrine.
namely,
if
evidence
illegally
seized
by
state
officers
is
handed
to
federal
officers
on
a
silver
platter,
without
any
participation
on
their
part,
that
it
is
admissible.
now,
there
are
at
least
six
reasons
in
my
judgment
why
that
doctrine
can
stand
and
why
it
has
no
further
validity.
and
the
first
and
i
think,
basic
reason
is
that
the
assumption
on
which
it
rested
has
been
abandoned
by
this
court.
your
honors
will
recall
that
in
the
weeks
case,
there
were
two
seizures
involved.
one
was
the
seizure
by
federal
officers
which
was
ordered
suppressed
and
the
other
was
the
seizure
by
state
officers
which
was
not
ordered
suppressed,
because
said
the
court,
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
reach
these
states
and
therefore,
an
illegal
seizure
by
state
officers
at
that
time,
did
not
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i'm
sorry
--
they
did
not
violate
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
that
was
in
1914.
35
years
past,
we
get
to
the
case
of
the
wolf
against
colorado.
that
held
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
includes
the
right
to
be
free
from
illegal
searches
and
seizures,
so
that
the
basis
on
which
the
state
court
seizure
in
weeks
was
rested
no
longer
upholds,
because
now,
an
illegal
seizure
by
state
officers
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
violates
the
federal
constitution
and
therefore,
it
is
inadmissible
in
a
federal
court.
let
me
take
--
let
me
take
one
sentence
from
the
weeks
opinion
which
i
think
sets
forth
its
rationale
succinctly
and
clearly.
the
court
there
said
that
if
the
evidence
in
question
can
thus
be
seized
and
held
and
used
in
evidence
against
the
citizen
accused
of
an
offense,
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
declaring
his
right
to
be
secure
against
such
searches
and
seizures
is
of
no
value.
and
so
far
as
those
--
thus
placed
is
concerned,
might
as
well
be
stricken
from
the
constitution.
now,
let
us
move
on
pass
1949
when
wolf
v.
colorado
has
held
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth,
incorporates
the
essential
guarantee
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
freedom
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
let
me
paraphrase
what
was
said
in
weeks
by
changing
a
single
word
that
if
this
articles
can
thus
be
seized
and
held
and
used
in
evidence
against
the
citizen
accused
of
an
offense,
the
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
declaring
his
right
to
be
secure
against
such
searches
and
seizures,
is
of
no
value
and
so
far
as
those
thus
placed
is
concerned,
might
as
well
be
stricken
from
the
constitution.
so
that
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
it
will
protect
and
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment,
less
than
it's
prepared
to
protect
the
fourth,
i
think
it
must
follow
that
the
state
seizure
aspect
of
weeks
is
gone
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
don't
think
with
all
deference
and
i
realize
i'm
talking
to
the
author
of
the
decision.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
--
the
wolf
case
did
not
involve
a
federal
prosecution.
the
wolf
case
as
i
read
it,
said,
“a
state
cannot
--
a
state
cannot
affirmatively
sanction
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,”
but
the
manner
in
which
the
state
enforces
the
protection
against
searches
and
seizures
is
up
to
the
state,
it
may
do
it
by
excluding
it,
it
may
do
it
otherwise.
now,
however,
we
have
a
situation
that
is
more
akin
to
the
benanti
case
because
we
have
an
illegal
search
and
seizure,
which
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
we
have
the
problem
not
that
we
had
in
wolf
of
admitting
the
fruits
of
that
violation
in
evidence
in
a
state
court,
we
have
the
problem
of
whether
that
evidence
is
to
be
admitted
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
and
i
say
the
same
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
and
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
no.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
believe
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
i
believe
that
it
does
at
least,
it
does
on
practice,
two
oregon
courts
suppress
this
evidence.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
well
--
well,
when
that
question
is
asked,
i
--
i've
taken
back
30
years
in
memory,
but
the
old
farmer
back
home
was
asked
whether
he
believed
in
baptism
and
he
said,
“good
lord,
yes,
i've
seen
it
done.”
well
right
here
in
this
record
there
are
two
suppressions
of
illegally
seized
evidence
by
state
courts
of
oregon.
so
whether
or
not,
the
--
all
of
the
elegantia
juris
of
weeks
has
been
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
in
--
in
firm
holdings
other
than
dicta,
in
fact,
they
suppressed
illegally
seized
evidence
and
they
suppressed
it
twice
here.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
they
suppressed
--
they
didn't
return
it.
they
--
they
suppressed
it
for
use
in
evidence.
they
turned
it
over
to
the
attorney
general
to
be
held
subject
to
the
further
orders
of
the
oregon
courts.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
in
the
--
in
the
--
not
necessarily,
no.
no,
because
suppose
they
suppress
narcotics,
you
don't
return
that
to
the
owner.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
there's
a
--
there's
a
statute
in
--
there's
a
statute
in
title
28,
which
was
considered
in
the
rea
case,
where
narcotics
taken
by
federal
officers
even
if
it's
suppressed,
is
held
subject
to
the
orders
of
the
federal
court.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
and
--
and
this
property
was
suppressed
not
--
it
couldn't
be
used
further
against
petitioners.
they
were
never
tried
on
the
state
indictment,
the
state
indictment
was
dismissed.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
was
dismissed
--
the
--
the
evidence
was
suppressed.
it
was
held
subject
to
the
order
in
the
--
the
courts
so
it's
really
the
rea
case,
but
getting
back
to
where
--
my
--
the
--
the
present
point
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
certainly.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
and
--
and
as
--
as
i
see
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
--
i
didn't
read
the
cases
that
way,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
--
i
looked
at
the
table
and
then
i
read
the
cases
and
i
arrive
at
the
--
at
the
conclusion.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
table
doesn't
read
the
oregon
cases
the
way
i
read
them.
let
--
let
us
leave
it
on
that.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
if
your
honor
read
those
cases,
then
we
read
them
differently.
but
i
--
i
read
those
cases
as
saying
empowers
it,
the
recent
case
says
no,
we've
never
adopted
the
laundy
dictum,
all
i
can
say
is
that
they
are
suppressed
and
they
were
suppressed
here.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
neither
would
i.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
--
i
would
agree.
i
would
agree
and
i
put
--
i
put
this
--
these
three
--
these
four
situations.
evidence
is
illegally
seized
by
federal
officers.
it's
sought
to
be
used
in
a
federal
prosecution.
you
can't
do
it
weeks.
evidence
is
severally
illegally
seized
by
federal
officers.
it
suppressed.
it's
then
sought
to
be
turned
over
to
the
state
for
prosecution.
again
you
can't
do
it,
rea.
evidence
is
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that's
right.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
correct.
third
situation
--
illegal
state
seizure
--
state
prosecution
that's
the
question
of
weeks
or
non-weeks
in
this
--
in
oregon
it
couldn't
be
used.
the
indictments
were
dismissed
and
the
fourth
situation,
illegal
state
seizure,
a
shift
in
other
direction
to
federal
officers,
why
should
you
be
able
to
turn
it
over
to
the
federal
officers.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
in
leaving
open
one
or
possibly
two
in
some
states
leaving
open
that
situation,
you
get
an
intolerable
answer
because
you
open
the
door
wide
for
connivance
and
subterfuge
and
evasion.
now,
i
don't
say
it
was
present
here,
i
say
the
way
is
open
because
while
the
hearing
on
the
state
--
first
state
motion
to
suppress
was
pending,
one
of
the
seized
reels
which
were
sought
to
be
suppressed,
was
played
back
to
an
fbi
agent.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
was
actually
seized
by
the
federal
government
under
a
federal
search
warrant.
the
federal
district
judge
hearing
the
motion
to
suppress
said
he
didn't
think
it
made
any
difference
whether
the
federal
search
warrant
was
legal
or
illegal.
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
him
because
if
the
illegal
state
seizure
tainted
this
evidence,
so
that
under
the
doctrine
for
which
i'm
contending
it
was
incapable
of
use
in
a
federal
court,
it
couldn't
be
cleansed
by
subsequent
seizure
under
a
federal
warrant
particularly
--
particularly,
when
that
evidence
at
the
time
was
in
the
custody,
constructive
custody
of
a
state
court.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
not
if
the
access
of
state
power
were
exerted
with
a
view
to
frustrating
federal
--
a
federal
prosecution
or
a
federal
action.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
apprehend
that
if
--
to
take
an
example,
if
certain
ballot
boxes
were
being
held
for
examination
by
a
federal
commission
who
--
operating
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
i
take
it,
those
could
not
be
rendered
inadmissible
by
a
sudden
excess
of
zeal
by
state
sheriffs
who
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
their
own
state
constitutional
provision
against
searches
and
seizure,
but
we
don't
have
that
here.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
no,
it
isn't.
(voice
overlap)
if
the
purpose
of
the
illegal
state
seizure
were
to
fasten
the
taint
on
materials
precluding
them
from
use
in
a
federal
prosecution.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
might
--
that
might
well
be
different,
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
we
don't
have
that
situation
here.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
we
-
we
don't
have
that
situation
here
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes
same
as
in
rea
--
same
as
in
rea.
the
federal
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
what
the
state
circuit
judge
tells
the
state
sheriffs
here,
your
officers
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
of
this
court.
you
can't
do
this
kind
skullduggery,
that's
precisely
what
they
say.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
so
is
this.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
but
the
--
but
the
effect
of
rea
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
--
i
again
repeat,
your
honor,
that
--
that
was
rea.
that
was
the
rea
case.
new
mexico
could
never
again
prosecute
rea.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly,
well
that
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
that
--
because
this
involves
the
converse
of
rea.
there
was
an
order
here
patterned
after
rea
by
the
state
circuit
court
directed
at
the
oregon
state
and
county
officials
saying,
"you
may
not
testify
regarding
your
skullduggery
in
the
federal
court".
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
--
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
this
–
no,
it
isn't
this
case
because
the
federal
search
warrant
was
directed
that
property
in
the
constructive
custody
of
state
courts.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
know
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
exactly
and
i
say
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
say
that
the
warrant
couldn't
reach
that,
but
what
i'm
saying
at
the
outset
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly
and
i'm
now
--
i'm
now
addressing
myself
to
the
silver
platter
doctrine
and
i
have
mentioned
the
four
situations
and
now,
there
are
certain
other
considerations
which
i'd
like
to
--
which
tell
the
theory
here,
as
logically
as
they
do
on
the
brief
and
that
is
this.
let's
go
back
to
non-constitutional
aspect
of
the
olmstead
case.
now
as
--
as
professor
coin's
paper
indicates
and
we
have
the
access
to
justice
brandeis'
papers,
he
originally
wanted
to
decide
the
olmstead
case
on
the
basis
that
the
federal
officers
were
violating
state
law
in
the
process
of
enforcing
federal
law
and
that
is
the
non-constitutional
feature
of
this
dissent.
now,
the
federal
officers
engaged
in
prosecuting
here,
did
not,
themselves,
violate
state
law,
namely
the
state
provisions
against
searches
and
seizures,
but
when
they
took
the
fruits
of
that
illegal
state
search,
i
submit
that
they
ratified
the
illegality
and
they
took
evidence
with
all
that
taint
there
unto
appertaining
and
i
say
that
on
the
reasoning
of
mr.
justice
brandeis'
non-constitutional
dissent,
that
should
be
inadmissible
in
federal
court,
in
that
respect,
it's
like
gambino.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
moreover
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
have
--
i
have
sighted
that
also
and
i
hope
that
your
honors
will
follow
that
dissent.
now,
there's
another
feature.
for
many
years,
it
was
impossible
to
obtain
here
any
adjudication
as
to
the
validity
or
otherwise
of
restricted
racial
covenants,
because
those
were
regarded
as
private
agreements.
and
then
in
shelley
against
kreamer,
it
was
held
that
when
you
take
that
private
agreement
into
a
state
court
and
get
a
state
injunction
that
is
a
--
that
is
state
action
and
that
is
state
action
to
be
governed
and
tested
by
the
contours
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
similarly
here,
what
was
originally
done
to
these
petitioners
was
state
action,
but
when
you
take
the
fruits
of
that
state
action
and
use
it
to
prove
the
corpus
delicti
of
a
federal
offense
in
a
federal
court,
in
a
federal
prosecution,
which
will
send
citizens
to
jail,
you
have
transformed
that
original
state
action
into
federal
action
and
i
say
it's
an
inadmissible
and
i
say
that
a
court
of
the
united
states
is
bound
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
vigorously
as
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
yes,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no.
i
--
i
don't
think
--
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
was
--
it
was
as
valid
when
burdeau
v.
mcdowell
is
before
the
court.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
know,
but
--
but
basically
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
but
basically,
the
--
the
weeks
case,
the
state
aspect
of
the
weeks
case
rests
on
the
proposition
that
state
officers
making
an
illegal
search
don't
violate
the
federal
constitution
because
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
bind
them.
now
then,
after
wolf,
when
state
officers
make
an
illegal
search,
they
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
and
the
same
--
then
the
same
must
be
true
of
the
weeks
case,
because
on
wolf
it
was
said
that
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
so,
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
but
--
but
for
the
most
part
--
but
for
the
most
part,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
over
rule
the
--
it
isn't
so
much
overruling
the
state
seizure
aspect
of
weeks
as
it
tends
to
recognize
that
that
portion
of
weeks
is
now
a
form
of
legal
driftwood
left
on
the
banks
of
legal
history,
where
the
stream
of
constitutional
interpretation
has
passed
upon.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
there's
one
other
feature
of
the
silver
platter
doctrine
and
that
is
the
conflicts
that
it
causes
between
state
and
federal
courts.
now
in
this
case
there
were
five
conflicts
between
state
and
federal
courts
as
a
consequence
of
the
silver
platter
doctrine.
conflict
number
one,
when
the
district
court
said,
“notwithstanding
the
concession
of
the
united
states
attorney
that
this
was
an
illegal
seizure,
i
will
let
it
in
nonetheless.”
there's
not
question
here
--
there
isn't
rea
of
a
reexamination.
second
conflict,
when
the
state
court
then
applied
the
converse
of
rea
to
enjoin
the
state
and
county
officers
from
testifying
regarding
that
illegal
seizure
in
which
they
are
--
had
participated.
third
conflict
when
the
district
--
u.s.
district
court
ordered
the
state
and
county
officers
to
disregard
the
injunction.
fourth
conflict,
when
they
were
cited
for
contempt
on
said
conflict
when
there
was
an
injunction
against
further
prosecution
of
the
contempt
proceedings.
contrary
was,
if
there
were
no
silver
platter
doctrine,
once
the
united
states
attorney
admitted
both
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
matter
we
may
treat
it
as
the
illegal,
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
entire
situation.
now,
of
course,
he
would
still
be
free
to
say,
well,
if
your
honors
please,
i
don't
agree
we
the
state
courts.
i
don't
think
it
developed
all
the
facts,
i
think
i
can
show
that
this
was
perfectly
legal,
valid
seizure
tested
by
state
and
or
by
federal
standards
and
particularly
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
standards,
i've
never
questioned
it
would
be
completely
open
to
the
u.s.
district
court,
indeed,
it
would
be
its
duty
to
reexamine,
but
that
question
didn't
arise.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
in
light
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
because
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
not
fourth
amendment,
your
honor.
it
can't
be
fourth
amendment.
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
reach
the
states.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
but
it
is
not
fair.
it
is
evidence
illegally
seized
by
state
officers
therefore,
if
any
federal
constitutional
provision
has
been
violated,
it's
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
--
if
oregon
for
instance,
had
a
statute
saying
that
on
the
basis
of
triple
hearsay,
you
can
break
into
--
into
dwelling
houses
in
the
nighttime
provided
only
that
you
get
your
information
from
the
uniformed
policeman
and
that
it
concerns
obscenity.
obviously,
that
would
be
bad
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
let
us
take
a
somewhat
borderline
case,
let
us
take
a
somewhat
borderline
case,
let
us
take
a
case
something
like
jones,
is
it
bad
because
it's
hearsay
or
is
it
bad
because
they're
now
supporting
facts.
and
then
i
think
the
federal
court
would
have
to
determine
whether
admissibility
would
violate
the
standards
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
other
words,
since
this
is
a
federal
prosecution,
it
can't
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
state
law
bearing
from
the
state
to
state,
nor
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
says,
"can
you
have
it
admissible
in
the
weeks'
jurisdiction
--
in
a
non-weeks
jurisdiction
and
admissible
--
inadmissible
in
the
weeks
jurisdiction
--
admissible
in
the
non-weeks
jurisdiction?"
in
other
words,
this
concerns
the
admissibility
of
evidence
in
a
federal
court
and
that
is
the
federal
question
on
the
federal
court,
is
not
included
by
any
state
determinations,
nor
by
any
state
law.
i
mean,
if
oregon
said
that
you
cannot
get
a
search
warrant
on
any
kind
of
the
hearsay,
if
oregon
for
instance,
followed
the
rule
of
the
grau
case,
that
the
only
kind
of
the
affidavit
must
be
the
--
of
the
sort
of
facts
that
would
be
admissible
on
evidence
at
a
trial.
the
federal
court
might
well
say,
will
this
might
violate
oregon
law,
but
we
think
it
comports
with
federal
standards
of
due
process
and
therefore
we
will
admit
it.
now
that
basically
is
our
position.
there
are
two
other
problems
which
i
don't
reach
for
mostly
for
lack
of
time.
one
is
the
question
of
the
converse
of
the
rea
case.
we
only
reach
that
in
--
in
case
that
the
evidence
is
admissible
and
we
discuss
whether
rea
is
a
doctrine
of
supremacy
or
comity.
and
then
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
federal
search
warrant,
that's
fully
covered
in
the
brief.
basically,
our
position
is
that
the
district
judge
was
right
in
saying
it
was
a
material
because
if
the
evidence
was
tainted,
it
couldn't
be
purified
by
having
another
search
warrant
applied
to
it.
the
federal
search
warrant
couldn't
reach
it
in
any
event,
because
it
was
a
state
custody.
and
finally,
since
the
validity
of
the
federal
search
warrant
wasn't
litigated
by
the
district
court,
it
can't
be
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
least
of
all,
where
counsel
seeking
to
suppress
the
evidence
was
cutoff
from
their
proof
as
they
were
here.
but
basically,
we
think
this
a
matter
of
silver
platter
and
we
think
that
when
silver
platter
is
reviewed
in
the
light
of
wolf
and
when
we
give
a
good
hard
new
look
at
what
mr.
justice
brandeis
tried
unsuccessfully
to
persuade
his
brethren
in
burdeau
v.
mcdowell
and
in
olmstead,
that
is
to
say
the
non-constitutional
aspect
that
the
conclusion
must
follow
that
there
can
be
no
room
for
introduction
in
the
federal
court
of
evidence
seized
by
state
officers
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
will
consider
that,
if
your
honor
please.
the
prosecution
makes
that
suggestion.
i
don't
think
you
can
properly
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
i
--
i'd
like
to
take
it
up,
i'm
prepared
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
on
--
on
these,
i'll
take
it
first
in
general
and
then
on
these
facts.
in
the
first
place,
i
don't
think
you
can
take
the
position
that
a
little
constitutionality
is
all
right
just
as
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
that
goes
--
if
that
goes
on
--
if
it
goes
on
little
--
unconstitutionality
i
don't
accept
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
if
it
goes
on
how
grievous
is
the
lack
of
good
faith,
then
let
me
just
review
the
facts
here.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
all
right
and
let
me
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
let
me
deal
with
the
question
which
is
also
raised
in
the
prosecution's
brief
of
that,
if
they
act
in
good
faith
or
are
guilty
an
inadvertent
act
failing
to
comply
with
all
the
technicalities
of
the
search
warrants,
it
should
be
called
all
right.
in
the
first
place,
there
was
no
good
faith
here.
langley
was
out
to
get
elkins
and
ordered
to
send
them
away
for
life
on
a
traffic
violation.
he
was
less
than
candid
with
the
state
district
judge
to
whom
he
applied
for
a
warrant,
because
the
warrant
to
be
executed
on
the
night
--
on
a
night
which
was
to
be
followed
by
three
non-judicial
days,
so
that
to
redress
an
illegal
breaking
on
a
thursday
night,
the
petitioners
have
to
wait
for
monday
morning.
during
the
interval,
during
that
non
judicial
interval,
the
state
officers
caused
that
tapes
to
be
copied
and
public
--
facilitated
their
publication
in
a
newspaper,
langley
used
the
tapes
to
get
the
petitioners
indicted
while
the
motion
to
suppress
was
pending
and
i
therefore
say
it's
just
mockery
to
talk
of
a
state
--
this
is
the
prosecution's
quotation,
“state
officers
acting
in
good
faith,
but
mistakenly
failing
to
comply
with
all
the
legal
requirements.”
or
later,
they
talked
about
evidence
of
say,
"silver
platter,
if
it
does,
is
rejected,
should
still
apply
to
evidence
not
obtained
by
intentional
or
evidence
which
wasn't
obtained
intentional
or
clear
violation
of
constitutional
rights.”
i
submit
that
when
people
forcibly
break
into
a
dwelling
house
at
night,
that's
neither
a
negligent
action,
nor
inadvertence.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
when
you
mean
federal
authorities,
do
you
mean
the
federal
court?
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
u.s.
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
u.s.
attorney
had
no
knowledge
of
--
there
is
a
finding,
he
had
no
knowledge
that
was
--
the
raid
was
to
be
conducted.
by
the
time
the
motion
to
suppress
was
being
heard,
there
was
available
--
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
at
the
state
district
court
and
the
state
circuit
court.
at
the
state
district
court,
which
was
where
they
took
testimony,
the
affidavit
was
in
evidence
and
herder's
testimony
that
he
knew
nothing
about
clark
and
knew
nothing
about
--
at
never
--
knew
nothing
--
didn't
know
langley
and
had
never
talked
to
him,
that
was
in
evidence.
then,
when
langley
was
called
as
the
(inaudible)
first
witness
on
the
--
the
federal
motion
to
suppress,
he
told
this
story
of
listening
in
on
a
phone
call.
that
was
followed
by
herder
who
again
repeated
that
he
didn't
know
clark,
didn't
know
where
he
lived,
didn't
know
anything
about
him
and
anything
he
passed
on
about
him,
he
had
passed
on
as
hearsay.
when
herder
left
the
stand,
the
district
judge
said,
"now,
mr.
lucky
what
about
this
seizure?
what
position
have
you
take
about?"
and
mr.
lucky
tried
to
say,
"well,
i
don't
try
to
take
any
position,"
and
then
he
wound
up
with
this
concession
that
--
we
must
--
for
the
purposes
of
this
matter
we
may
treat
it
as
illegal.
so
that
the
u.s.
attorney
was
fully
aware
of
the
fact
that
this,
our
affidavit
had
only
the
authenticity
of
a
$3
bill.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
he
was
sufficiently
impressed
by
it,
than
what
he
heard
--
heard
his
testimony
so
well,
now,
what's
you
position
on
this?
and
i
--
and
later
on,
this
is
very
interesting
at
page
313
of
the
record
which
is
when
the
--
when
the
state
restraining
order
is
brought,
there
is
a
long
flag
waving,
hoorah,
about
the
supremacy
clause
and
twice
on
that
page
313,
the
u.s.
district
judge
who
have
been
an
oregon
state
judge
before
his
appointment
to
the
federal
bench,
said
that
in
his
view,
the
order
of
the
state
district
court
was
correct
in
holding
the
state
search
illegal
and
in
suppressing
the
evidence
and
later
on,
on
the
page
he
says
i
think
in
my
opinion,
the
state
circuit
court
was
right
in
holding
the
search
illegal
and
in
suppressing
the
evidence.
so,
while
he
didn't
rule
on
it
because
in
his
view,
it
was
immaterial,
i
think
he
--
he
never
for
a
minute,
thought
that
it
was
legal.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
think
they're
entirely
irrelevant.
it's
just
another
effort
to
change
the
record
when
we
get
up
here
on
the
merits.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
if
the
court
please.
in
connection
with
the
facts
bearing
on
the
execution
of
the
affidavit,
i
think
i
can
shorten
matters
by
referring
your
honors
to
the
reply
brief
in
which
we
have
set
forth
the
evidence
more
fully
and
hence
more
accurately
than
it
was
presented
by
the
prosecution
either
in
writing
or
orally.
the
one
point
i
do
want
to
make
is
this,
that
because
of
the
concession
made
by
mr.
luckey
at
the
trial
qua
that
for
purposes
of
this
matter,
namely,
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence,
we
may
plead
it
the
state
seizure
as
illegal.
there
was
no
need
to
call
williams.
there
was
no
need
to
recall
langley
for
further
impeachment.
it
was
conceded
that
it
was
illegal.
indeed,
in
this
reply
brief,
i
refer
at
some
length
to
unprinted
portions
of
the
state
district
court
hearing
on
that
motion
to
suppress,
and
i
have
to
do
so
because
if
i
had
any
indication
that
at
this
juncture,
the
prosecution
would
try
to
show
that
this
utterly
invalid
affidavit
had
some
basis
of
validity,
this
would
all
have
been
in
print
and
would
have
been
much
easier
and
that
underscores
the
--
the
lack
of
justification
for
the
present
attempt
to
change
the
basis
on
which
this
case
was
litigated
through
three
courts.
now,
in
the
time
remaining,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
primarily
to
the
heart
of
the
silver
platter
doctrine.
in
the
heart
of
that
doctrine
is
to
what
extent
have
subsequent
events
changed
the
state
seizure
aspect
of
the
weeks
case.
weeks
had
two
aspects,
the
federal
seizure
suppressed,
the
state
seizure
not
suppressed
and
illegal
state
seizure.
now,
insofar
as
the
--
that
state
seizure
in
weeks
involved
a
violation
of
state
law
as
qua
state
law.
it
was
the
burdeau
v.
mcdowell,
the
non-constitutional
aspect
of
olmstead,
namely,
gambino,
namely,
to
what
extent
will
evidence
seized
by
means
that
shock
the
conscience
or
offend
one's
standards
of
propriety
be
admissible
in
federal
court
and
that
is
one
of
the
questions
here,
but
there
was
another
feature
of
weeks,
which,
i
think,
was
changed
by
wolf
against
colorado.
at
the
time
of
weeks,
the
illegal
state
seizure
was
not
considered
to
have
violated
the
federal
constitution.
following
wolf
versus
colorado,
we
have
a
different
view,
an
illegal
state
search
and
seizure
does
violate
the
federal
constitution
because
it
is
a
denial
of
due
process
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
then
we
have
the
problem,
how
shall
such
a
violation
be
redress?
now,
wolf
versus
colorado
holds,
as
long
as
it's
enforced,
holds
that
if
the
state
in
a
state
prosecution
provides
for
any
other
kind
of
redress
be
it
criminal
prosecution
of
the
offending
officers,
civil
action
for
damages,
anything
else,
as
long
as
the
state
provides
in
a
--
in
understate
law
redress
for
those
aggrieved
by
illegal
state
seizures,
the
state
is
free
to
provide
either
that
the
evidence
maybe
admitted
in
its
criminal
prosecutions
as
in
wolf
v.
colorado
or
else
as
is
now
the
rule
in
california,
as
is
the
rule
in
practice
in
oregon
that
it
will
not
be
admitted.
now,
that
is
a
purely
state
problem.
then
we
have
the
federal
problem,
which
wasn't
wolf
v.
colorado.
we
have
the
federal
problem
where
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
evidence
is
obtained.
may
the
fruits
of
that
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
be
admissible
in
a
federal
prosecution.
and
that,
if
i
may
translate
it
into
an
analogy,
that
is
the
difference
between
schwartz
versus
texas
and
benanti
against
the
united
states.
and
it
is
our
position,
and
i
emphasize
this
because,
to
my
mind,
it
is
the
heart
of
this
case,
that
a
--
the
federal
court
sets
to
redress
all
of
the
constitution.
it
has
never
until
mr.
wilkey
spoke
been
a
ground
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
a
federal
court
that
a
proceeding
there
involved
inquiry
into
the
validity
of
the
acts
of
the
state
judiciary.
and
we
say
that
where
there
is
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
that
the
weeks
rule
which
supplies
the
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment
should
be
equally
applicable
to
violations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
that
basically
is
our
position.
now,
touching
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
is
a
question
of
a
rule
of
evidence
whether
we
will
fashion
the
same
rule
of
evidence
to
protect
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
35
years
ago
the
court
fashioned
to
protect
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
what
your
honor
said
in
the
--
in
the
wolf
against
colorado.
that
the
--
that
the
weeks
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
but
not
--
now,
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
all
right.
now,
the
--
now,
the
question
here
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
question
is
this.
a
--
an
illegal
search
by
federal
officers
violates
the
fourth
amendment,
an
illegal
search
by
state
offices
violates
the
fou
rteenth
amendment.
to
that
point,
we're
on
common
ground,
i
think.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
a
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
a
search
by
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
then
if
--
if
the
illegal
state
search
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
if
the
illegal
state
search
in
question
is
not
a
violation
--
is
not
such
a
deprivation
of
due
process
that
it
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
i
will
agree
that
we
have
the
burdeau
v.mcdowell
the
non-constitutional
olmstead.
where,
however,
the
illegal
state
seizure
reaches
such
proportions
of
enormity
that
shall
i
say
five
consciences
here
are
shock
so
that
it's
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
we
have
the
weeks'
question,
how
will
a
federal
court
in
which
the
fruits
of
that
violation
of
the
constitution
are
offered?
how
will
a
federal
court
react?
and
i
say
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that's
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
i
have
--
i
have
been
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
i
have
been
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
and
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
and
i
have
--
have
respected
every
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
have
respected
every
opinion,
court
opinion
here,
however
much
in
particular
cases,
i
might
have
preferred
to
dissent
but
the
point
i
make
is
basically
the
point
that
judge
hastie
spelled
out
in
hanna
that
the
prosecution
wasn't
prepared
to
bring
up
here,
namely,
of
the
effect
of
wolf
v.
colorado
on
the
state
seizure
aspect
of
weeks.
and
it
is
fair
to
say
that
that
impact,
the
full
impact
of
wolf
v.
colorado
on
the
state
aspect
of
weeks
was
not
recognized
on
the
day
either
that
wolf
and
lustig
came
down
because
the
concurring
opinion
in
lustig,
and
there
was
no
opinion
of
the
court
in
lustig,
the
concurring
opinion
in
lustig
said
all
illegal
seizure
should
be
excluded.
it
did
not
spell
out
as
judge
hastie
did
in
the
hanna
case,
and
i
have
followed
my
distinguished
classmate
at
somewhat
greater
length
in
spelling
out
why
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
should
meet
the
same
short
shrift
of
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
certainly,
wolf
--
neither
wolf
nor
lustig,
which
were
in
gremial
legis
for
more
than
8
months.
at
the
close
of
that
eight
months
of
discussion,
i'm
sure
that
it
--
the
--
even
--
not
all
the
implications
of
either
decision
could
have
been
felt
but
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
am
arguing
now
the
implications
from
it
but
i
will
say
this,
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
if
--
if
we
have
here
the
first
inroad
in
the
silver
platter
in
the
form
of
a
rochin
situation,
then
this
is
that
rochin
situation
because
langley
cited
in
his
affidavit
the
source
of
my
information
is
herder.
langley
set
forth
no
supporting
facts.
langley
did
not,
in
that
affidavit,
rely
on
newspaper
reporters
to
say
“i
have
heard
from
faceless
informers
or
my
undercover
people.”
he
said
the
source
of
my
information
is
chief
herder,
and
that's
all
he
said.
he
gave
no
such
supporting
facts
as
were
present
in
the
affidavit
in
jones,
decided
yesterday,
and
when
herder
was
on
the
state
in
two
courts,
he
said
“i
don't
know
clark.
i've
never
talked
to
langley.”
and
langley
admitted,
page
62
of
this
record,
that
when
he
was
“listening
in
on
this
telephone
conversation”,
he
never
advised
chief
herder
that
he
was
listening
in.
and
that's
why
we
say
that
never
took
place.
so
that
you
have
a
state
officer
acting
in
bad
faith,
acting
on
the
eve
of
a
serious
of
three
non
judicial
day
sending
people
accompanied
by
newspaper
reporters
and
the
cameramen
to
break
into
a
dwelling
house
in
--
in
the
nighttime
and
then
--
and
then
rummage
around
and
seized
things.
now,
it
seems
to
me
--
maybe
i
shocked
more
easily
now
than
i
used
to
on
--
in
the
past
but
that
shocks
me
as
much
as
rochin
does.
i
think
it's
just
as
bad
to
have
the
sheriff's
break
in
as
to
have
the
stomach
pump
administered.
