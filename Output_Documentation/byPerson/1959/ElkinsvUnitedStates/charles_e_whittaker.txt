mr.
wiener
may
ask
you
please,
sir?
is
it
correct
to
say
that
this
evidence
was
turned
over
by
the
state
to
the
federal
government
under
these
facts?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
would
the
bundling
or
even
purposeful
misuse
of
process
by
state
officers,
forever
put
out
of
use,
the
possible
proper
seizure
of
evidence
and
its
use
by
the
federal
government.

the
federal

relevant
to
a

you
say
in
that

there
isn't
a
taint
--
there
isn't
a
--
an
inexpugnable
infection
or
taint,
upon
that
evidentiary
material,
is
that
it?
