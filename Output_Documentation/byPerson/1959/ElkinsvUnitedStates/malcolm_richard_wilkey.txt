mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
outline
the
position
we
will
take
here
in
argument.
as
the
opposition
counsel
has
done,
i
shall
devote
myself
primarily
to
two
points.
first,
being
that
the
state
search
and
seizure
was
valid
under
both
the
federal
constitution
requirements
and
the
state
standards
and
that
if
it
meets
the
federal
constitutional
requirements,
this
should
sufficient
for
admissibility
in
the
federal
courts.
secondly,
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
on
the
facts
of
the
elkins
case,
this
is
no
case
for
this
court
to
adopt
a
rule
of
exclusion
of
evidence,
otherwise
admissible
in
federal
courts
because
of
the
conduct
of
state
officials,
law
enforcement
officers
in
the
obtaining
of
the
evidence.
now,
we
submit
that
first
of
all,
this
warrant
meets
to
the
search
and
seizure
based
on
the
affidavit
and
the
warrant
meets
federal
standards.
also,
we
suggest,
that
those
standards
are
virtually
equivalent
to
the
standards
in
oregon,
as
petitioner
on
page
48
of
this
original
brief
states.
now
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
the
petitioners'
counsel
why
he
did
not
rest
upon
oregon
only
deciding
that
the
oregon
courts
deciding
this
on
oregon
law
that
that
would
be
sufficient.
the
petitioner,
mr.
justice,
on
page
50
of
his
brief,
as
i
think
he
stated
orally
here,
has
been
quite
candid
in
saying
that
we
have
no
doubt
that
a
federal
court
would
not
be
concluded
by
prior
state
court
determination
that
particular
evidence
was
obtained
in
violation
of
state
law
certainly
where
the
state
court
had
applied
an
erroneous
measure
of
constitutionality
or
even
more
clearly,
where
operation
of
the
state
law
would
frustrate
federal
policies
or
even
violate
the
federal
constitution.
so,
we
think
that
petitioner
admits
that
oregon
state
law
is
not
determinative
of
this
and
if
the
rule
of
exclusion
must
be
based
entirely
on
whether
or
not
this
search
and
seizure
and
the
warrant
met
federal
constitutional
standards
pertaining
to
the
fourteenth
and
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
there
are
--
they
are
two
different
things
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
we
think
--
we
think
that
not
only
one,
should
the
federal
court
be
free
to
examine,
but
secondly
that
if
the
oregon
state
law
or
the
law
of
any
other
state
is
more
restricted
than
the
constitutional
requirement,
then
the
constitutional
requirement
should
provide
a
minimal
standard
in
order
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
think
that
essentially
in
the
federal
court,
the
inquiry
should
be
if
it
meets
federal
constitutional
standards.
and
actually
in
most
cases,
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
re-litigate
the
state
law
question,
in
most
cases.
i
think
that
if
they
--
if
there's
showing
that
the
state
law
was
more
restricted
than
the
federal,
that
the
federal
prosecutor
should
be
able
to
meet
federal
constitutional
standards
to
introduce
the
evidence.
now,
in
--
i
remind
your
honor
that
in
the
rios
case,
we
do
have
a
question
on
the
redetermination
there,
which
i'll
get
to
in
that
case.
and
for
the
reason,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
you
enunciated
in
the
colloquy
with
counsel
on
another
point,
that
we
must
have
a
uniform
rule
of
evidence
in
the
federal
courts,
throughout
the
land.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
now,
i
should
like
to
make
clear
as
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
that
the
united
states
attorney
did
not
in
mr.
justice
harlan
words
go
quite
so
far,
go
so
far
in
making
a
concession.
in
my
own
words,
the
government
and
the
prosecution
did
not
make
any
concession
whatever
as
to
illegality
of
the
state
seizure.
and
i
refer
your
honors
to
the
record
on
page
79
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
“where
the
court
inquired,”
this
was
the
page
before
the
quotation
read
by
posing
counsel.
the
court,
“mr.
lucky
i
wonder
if
you
can
advised
me,
does
the
government
concede
that
the
search
and
seizure
had
by
the
state
officials,
the
sheriff
of
multnomah
county,
the
original
seizure
of
these
articles
now
sought
to
be
suppressed,
whether
or
not,
that
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure?
have
you
taken
any
position
about
it
but
that
is
binding
in
this
court?”
mr.
lucky,
“on
that
matter
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
position
of
the
government
would
be
that
it
is
immaterial
whether
or
not,
it
was
illegal.
and
we
wouldn't
feel
it
was
incumbent
upon
us
to
establish
the
legality
of
that
search
and
seizure.”
now,
then
follows
the
quotation
read
by
opposing
counsel
--
i
--
mr.
lucky
goes
on,
“on
the
other
hand,
we
would
not
desire
to
redress.
i
think
that
should
be
review
--
the
state
processes
and
mark
it
as
illegal
in
our
view.
what
mr.
lucky
was
doing
there
was
relying
on
the
silver
platter
doctrine.
he
did
not
wish
in
this
federal
proceeding
to
get
into
and
inquire
into
the
hassle
and
the
tussle
that
was
going
on
in
the
state
courts
and
the
state
political
process
in
regard
to
the
people
involved.
and
later
on
in
my
argument
i
shall
make
clear
why
in
this
case
at
least,
on
these
facts,
it
was
the
better
part
of
wisdom
for
neither
the
federal
prosecutor
nor
the
federal
judge
to
concern
himself
with
this
hassle
pulling
back
and
forth
that
was
going
on
i
--
i
cannot
state.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
trial
judge
deciding
--
that
he
could
accept
the
evidence
without
further
inquiry
as
to
the
validity
of
the
state
seizure.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
court
can
because
all
of
the
evidence
available
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
could
be
done
and
i
think
it
was
in
the
jones
case
decided
today
that
the
question
of
probable
cause,
a
decision
was
made
by
this
court
without
sending
it
back
for
examination
on
that.
however,
we
do
say
this
that
only
if
this
court
makes
a
determination
that
the
seizure
first
was
invalid
and
secondly,
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
silver
platter
doctrine
under
any
circumstances
should
the
conviction
be
reversed.
the
second
alternative
the
government
would
urge
would
be
that
it
be
sent
back,
but
we
think
that
the
record
here
is
complete
in
order
that
a
determination
maybe
made
that
this
was
a
valid
search
and
seizure
by
federal
constitutional
standards
and
indeed
by
the
state
constitutional
standards
in
oregon.
now
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
see
--
the
two
state
courts
held
that
the
seizure
was
illegal
under
oregon
law,
but
they
did
not
suppress
the
others.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
and
they
did
not
consider
federal
constitutional
questions.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
it
went
to
the
circuit
court
which
is
the
trial
court
for
felonies.
the
district
court
in
oregon
is
a
--
not
a
court
of
record.
in
the
city,
it's
called
a
district
court.
the
same
equivalent
court
in
the
county
is
called
the
justice
of
the
peace.
every
proceeding
in
that
court
is
subject
de
novo
litigation
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes
your
honor,
they
found
it
to
be
illegal,
but
only
on
the
record
made
in
the
court
below.
there
was
no
additional
proof
put
in,
no
evidence
was
heard
by
the
state
at
anytime
in
these
two
proceedings
and
contrary
to
the
assertion
by
petitioner,
this
proceeding
has
not
been
terminated
in
oregon,
because
contrary
to
his
assertion,
this
evidence
was
never
suppressed
by
either
oregon
court,
the
evidence
was
impounded
and
turned
over
to
the
state
attorney
general,
subject
to
such
orders
as
this
court
might
make
later
on.
it
has
never
been
finally
adjudicated
the
in
oregon
that
this
evidence
cannot
be
used
in
an
oregon
court
and
furthermore,
subject
--
a
subsequent
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
don't
think
that
the
state
indictment
is
a
factor.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that's
the
statement
indictment
has
been
dismissed.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
don't
know
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes
but
i
suspected
the
indictment
was
dismissed
without
prejudice.
in
other
words,
this
evidence
might
be
available
on
a
prosecution
order.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
think,
on
september
the
26th
the
two,
prosecuting
attorney
and
his
chief
deputy
wrote
a
letter
in
which
they
urged
the
dismissal
of
this
indictment
and
i
think
that
the
motivating
factor
in
that
was
that
this
evidence
had
been
ruled
illegal
and
was
then
impounded
in
the
custody
of
the
state
attorney
general.
it
was
only
about
a
year
more
later
that
eventually
in
march,
i
think
of
1958,
that
it
came
around
to
the
dismissed
in
the
state
courts.
now,
furthermore,
there
are
other
proceedings
pending
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
think
they're
here
in
the
possession
of
the
clerk
of
this
court.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
on
september
the
5th,
1956.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
from
the
deposit
vault
--
a
box
in
the
bank.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
by
a
warrant.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
by
--
from
the
bank.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
there
were
in
the
hands
of
the
state
attorney
general
and
he
had
entrusted
that
actual
custody
to
two
state
police
officers
with
the
name
cross
and
gurdain
who
in
--
in
furtherance
of
their
duty,
took
out
a
box
in
the
bank
vault
and
there
placed
them
for
security.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that
is
correct
your,
honor.
now
i
should
like,
on
this
question
of
the
status
of
these
materials,
i
should
like
to
clarify
the
situation
by
reading
from
the
record
on
page
24
and
page
26.
page
24
is
the
order
of
this
district
judge
maris,
as
to
what
he
did
with
it.
the
first
two
full
paragraphs
deal
for
his
reason
that
the
warrant
was
invalid.
the
third
paragraph
has
to
do
with
articles
which
were
sought
to
be
seized,
which
were
named
in
the
warrant.
that
is
not
material
here.
none
of
those
are
in
this
case.
the
second
paragraph
disposes
of
the
slot
machines
which
were
contraband
and
could
be
destroyed.
the
--
the
fifth
paragraph
deals
with
the
property
here.
it
is
further
ordered
and
adjudged
in
view
of
the
executive
order
from
the
governor
of
the
state
of
oregon
that
had
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
24.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes
sir,
fifth
full
paragraph.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
it
is
further
ordered
and
adjudged
in
view
of
the
executive
order
from
the
governor
of
the
state
of
oregon,
the
remaining
property
b
and
the
same
as
hereby
ordered
impounded
in
the
procession
of
the
sheriff
of
multnomah
county
to
be
held
and
released
only
upon
the
direction
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
oregon
or
such
higher
circuit
or
supreme
court
upon
the
whom
the
matter
maybe
heard.
he
is
now
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
best
dealt
with
--
taking
the
prosecution
in
this
county
out
of
the
hands
of
the
local
prosecuting
attorney
langley
and
placing
it
in
the
hands
of
thornton,
the
state
attorney
general.
this
is
a
--
the
whole
picture
is
a
struggle
for
--
it's
a
local
hassle
and
struggle
between
various
law
enforcement
officers
and
various
people
in
oregon
which
is
one
excellent
reason
why
the
federal
prosecutor
in
the
federal
court
didn't
get
into
this
whole
thing
in
the
hearing.
now,
on
page
26,
we
have
the
words
of
the
circuit
judge
at
third
full
paragraph,
“i'm
not
going
to
suppress
the
evidence
in
that
case.
i
am
going
to
turn
that
over
to
the
attorney
general,”
and
so
on.
now,
your
honors,
neither
court
suppressed
this
evidence.
they
held
it
subject
to
the
orders
of
higher
courts
for
possible
future
use.
it's
true
the
--
see
--
the
warrant
has
held
--
declared
illegal,
but
there
was
no
suppression
of
the
evidence
and
one
reason
perhaps
maybe
that
oregon
does
not
have
a
weeks
rule
and
so
it
was
undecided
until
subsequent
litigation
what
should
be
done
with
this
evidence.
now
this
petitioner's
case
here
rests
on
two
pretty
fragile
supports.
one
is
the
determination
by
this
local
magistrate
in
oregon
that
the
--
this
affidavit
was
invalid
and
the
search
and
seizure
was
illegal,
that's
his
first
point.
secondly,
is
assertion
that
oregon
has
a
rule
of
exclusion
along
the
lines
of
weeks.
now,
throughout
his
brief
and
his
argument,
there
are
drawn
various
deductions
as
to
the
harmony
of
state
and
federal
rule
preventing
conflicts,
the
logic
of
applying
the
same
rules,
all
of
which
fall
with
this
false
premise
that
oregon
has,
which
it
does
not,
a
weeks
rule.
now,
on
the
first
point
on
the
determination
of
this
local
magistrate,
again,
i
should
like
to
--
to
turn
to
the
record
on
page
24
and
to
show
that
on
federal
law
at
least
as
handed
down
this
morning,
this
magistrate
was
clearly
wrong.
in
the
first
paragraph
he
says,
"it
is
hereby
ordered
and
adjudged
that
the
affidavit
in
support
of
the
search
warrant,
shows
upon
its
face
that
it
was
based
primarily
upon
information
and
belief
only”
and
so
on.
now
that,
your
honors,
is
the
reason
that
the
district
court,
the
local
magistrate
of
the
justice
of
the
peace
level
and
also
the
circuit
court,
thought
that
this
whole
search
and
seizure
was
illegal.
but
as
the
decision
in
the
jones
case
holds,
certainly
that
is
not
the
standard
in
the
federal
courts
because
in
page
13th
of
the
slip
opinion,
this
court
said,
we
conclude
therefore,
the
hearsay
maybe
the
basis
for
a
warrant
and
it
goes
on
to
discuss
that.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
chief
justice,
i
didn't
make
it
clear
apparently
going
over
that
the
first
time.
the
paragraph
that
you
were
very
properly
concerned
with
does
not
relate
to
the
articles
here
before
this
court.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
that
does
refer
that
next
to
last
paragraph
does
refer
to
the
property
here
before
this
court.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
but
the
paragraph,
two
paragraphs
above,
where
he
says,
"the
search
warrant
is
held
in
all
affects
to
be
a
nullity."
now,
of
course,
that
applies
to
the
warrant
as
a
whole.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes
indeed.
he
did
say
that.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
but
the
articles
that
he
suppressed
were
those
which
were
named
in
the
warrant.
there
were
some
recordings
which
were
listed
in
the
warrant
and
which
were
returned,
i
believe.
and
it
is
those
that
are
ordered
suppressed,
not
any
articles
that
are
in
this
--
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
your
honor,
whether
likely
or
wrongly,
we
have
always
interpreted
this
phraseology
here
that
any
article
seized
under
the
warrant
meant
those
named
in
the
warrant
because
there
were
some
that
are
named
and
seized
and
then,
the
--
he
differentiated
between
those
items
which
he
suppressed
and
the
next
two
items,
one
was
the
slot
machines
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
and
the
other
were
these
tapes
which
are
here
involved.
there
is
a
careful
differentiation
there.
i
believe
your
honor
will
find
that
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
and
furthermore,
i
think
that
it's
true
under
oregon
law
that
this
magistrate
had
no
authority
to
--
really
to
deal
with
anything
except
the
items
which
were
named
and
sought
for
in
the
warrant
and
then
all
he
could
do
was
to
hold
in
any
other
items
which
might
be
gathered
up
for
the
circuit
court.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
same,
i
think,
as
the
district
court.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
at
this
moment
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
i
don't
find
the
order
of
the
circuit
court
here.
the
words
i
think
are
clearly
differentiate.
they're
on
page
26,
the
once
that
i've
read.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
page
--
the
middle
of
page
26
that's
the
circuit
judge
speaking,
that's
for
--
speaking
from
the
bench
judge
lionel.
now,
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
oregon
is
a
weeks
rule
case,
i
refer
to
state
versus
hoover
and
the
--
the
language
of
the
court
in
state
versus
hoover
was
this.
“the
federal
practice
is
to
deny
the
use
of
such
evidence,
state
versus
laundy,
citing
a
1922
case.
this
rule
of
practice,
they
are
quoting
from
laundy,
now
this
rule
of
practice
sanctioned
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
are
for
the
same
reason
which
recommended
to
that
court
be
adopted
and
followed
by
the
courts
of
this
state”
from
laundy,
which
is
a
dictum.
then
the
court
of
oregon
goes
on
in
the
hoover
case,
but
there
in
laundy,
as
here,
it
was
not
necessary
to
reach
the
question.
we
have
never
been
confronted
with
a
case
which
has
squarely
demanded
the
decision
to
accept
or
reject
the
dictum
of
the
laundy
case.
now
that
statement
of
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
in
state
versus
hoover
came
down
in
november
1959.
that
confirms
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think,
in
his
categorizing
of
the
position
of
oregon
in
wolf.
it
confirms
the
oregon
state
law
review
article
of
--
the
oregon
law
review
journal
of
an
earlier
date,
which
said
that
the
question
perhaps
still
could
be
decided
that
oregon
had
gone
with
the
weeks
rule
of
state.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
think
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
--
i
--
but
our
position
is
simply
that
is
not
a
weeks
rule
case,
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
exclusion.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that,
your
honor,
is
part
of
the
evidence
showing
the
playback
and
forth,
the
tussle
that
was
going
on
between
people
in
a
bourdon
in
oregon
at
this
time.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
think
that
is
correct
and
your
honor
will
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
think
that
you
are,
mr.
justice
brennan.you
will
recall
a
few
minutes
ago,
i
said
that
langley
and
his
chief
assistant
wrote
a
letter
in
which
they
asked
for
the
dismissal
of
these
indictments
which
wasn't
taken
up
--
action
wasn't
taken
on
it
for
many
months.
and
as
far
as
the
position
of
the
state
attorney
general
of
oregon,
i
--
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
413
of
the
record
in
which
the
district
judge,
judge
maris
of
this
lower
court,
in
the
middle
of
the
page
413,
a
--
or
little
higher,
the
attorney
general,
this
mr.
judge
maris
saying,
"the
attorney
general
has
likewise
asked
me
to
rule
on
this
point
and
he
said
he
would
abide
by
the
ruling
of
the
court."
now
a
little
further,
mr.
hewlett
who's
one
of
the
prosecutors
for
the
state,
says
"the
attorney
general
has
come
into
the
situation
and
has
asked
the
court
in
chambers
concerning
this
matter
has
discussed
it."
so,
this
part
of
the
play
that
goes
on
here.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
think
that
is
correct,
but
these
same
prosecutors
that
is
mr.
langley
and
mr.
--
as
chief
assistant
mr.
lonagan
not
to
be
confused
with
the
circuit
judge
with
the
same
name,
those
two
prosecutors
did
not
feel
that
this
determination
was
correct
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
226
or
in
the
middle
of
page
226,
you
will
see
mr.
lonagan
saying,
"the
raid
was
not
illegal,
sir."
and
then
down
below
at
the
end
of
the
page,
is
--
in
referring
to
oregon
being
a
weeks
rule
case,
i
might
add
that
it
is
never
definitely
established
in
the
state
of
oregon
that
oregon
follows
the
federal
rule
and
he
goes
on
about
that.
and
then
earlier
at
the
very
top
of
the
page
referring
to
the
state
attorney
general
and
he,
the
state
attorney
general
had
seen
to
it
that
the
evidence
in
favor
of
the
state
was
not
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
state.
now,
the
two
prosecutors
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
don't
know
what
the
intent.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
precisely,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
precisely.
now,
one
other
point
on
this,
on
the
position
of
the
state
prosecutors,
mr.
langley
and
mr.
lonagan
and
mr.
hewlett
who
was
handling
the
case
before
judge
maris.
over
on
page
412,
i
simply
want
to
make
this
point
that
the
state
ruling
of
the
state
district
court,
judge
maris
was
purely
on
the
face
with
the
affidavit
here,
page
412
about
seven
lines
down
--
six
lines
down.
i
can
see
no
further
reason
for
continuing
a
hearing
of
this
case
because
we
always
will
have
to
go
back
to
the
affidavit
which
is
the
original,
the
starting
document
which
i
now
find
under
the
state
law
to
be
faulty.
mr.
hewlett
who
is
the
prosecutor
in
charge
of
the
case,
“your
honor,
you
haven't
allowed
the
state
to
put
on
any
testimony
at
all
or
to
argue
the
question?”
the
court,
“you
can't
change
this
document.”
mr.
hewlett
“it's
just
as
good
as
gold,
your
honor.”
now,
my
point
there
is
that
at
no
time
in
the
state
district
court
or
in
the
circuit
court
once
the
state
prosecutor
represented
by
langley
lonagan
and
hewlett
allowed
to
offer
any
evidence
that
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
was
purely
on
the
face
of
the
affidavit
that
it
was
invalid
because
it
was
hearsay
and
this
court
has
said
in
jones
versus
united
states
today
that
that
at
least,
is
not
the
federal
standard.
and
in
state
versus
hoover,
we
would
argue
that
information
of
a
reliable
sort
whether
hearsay
or
not,
can
be
made
the
basis
of
an
affidavit
even
in
oregon.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
which
paragraph
is
that
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
there
was
a
return
made
on
the
warrant.
the
return
made
on
the
warrant
which
was
before
it.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
well,
your
honor
i
would
say
--
that
you
can
no
more
rule
the
warrants
illegal
by
what
is
found
or
not
found
after
it
then
you
can
rule
it
legal,
by
what
is
found
or
not
found,
i
think
this
court
has
said
that
at
least
in
one
case,
they
did
--
the
--
the
warrant
was
for
two
things.
indecent
photographs,
indecent
recordings,
they
found
some
recordings
and
made
return
on
the
warrant,
they
didn't
find
the
photographs.
they
did
find
also
the
slot
machines
and
the
other
tapes
which
are
before
this
court.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
in
the
jones
case?
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
cite
the
facts
on
which
district
attorney
and
langley
relied
and
on
which
he
got
to
his
affidavit,
the
probable
cause
that
he
had.
first
of
all
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
permission
of
the
court,
in
my
remaining
time,
i
wish
to
devote
it
principally
to
a
discussion
of
the
silver
platter
doctrine,
that
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
a
rigid
rule
of
exclusion
in
the
federal
courts
should
be
adopted
where
other
than
federal
officers
are
concerned.
that
was
the
ground
of
decision
in
the
state
--
in
the
federal
district
court.
that
was
the
ground
on
which
the
united
states
attorney
proceeded
in
presenting
the
case
on
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence
in
the
federal
court.
and
we
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
in
this
record
here,
this
record
in
elkins
demonstrates
the
wisdom
of
such
a
procedure
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
attorney,
and
there
was
such
a
ruling
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
district
judge.
there's
additional
graph
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
intend
to
get
to
that.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
thank
you.
and
there's
an
additional
ground
relied
on
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
i
wish
to
discuss
and
that
is
the
validity
of
the
federal
warrant
for
the
search
and
which
--
by
which
the
tapes
came
into
the
custody
of
the
federal
court.
that
was
an
additional
ground
which
we
submit
all
of
the
evidence
was
fully
developed
in
the
trial
court
and
the
circuit
court
relied
upon
that
in
addition
to
the
silver
platter
doctrine.
now,
in
connection
with
that,
i
should
like
to
post
for
the
court's
consideration,
the
situation
which
confronted
the
federal
officers
at
the
time
of
the
state
seizures.
the
fbi
agent
testified
that
he
learned
of
these
seizures
by
reading
the
newspapers,
the
following
morning.
portions
of
the
tapes
were
printed
in
the
newspapers.
it
was
apparent
that
if
all
of
the
accounts
were
true,
there
existed
a
federal
violation.
following
up
this
information
coming
to
him,
he
went
over
to
the
state
officers
and
he
listened
to
some
--
to
one
of
the
tapes
that
i
believe
was
on
tuesday
morning
and
the
tape
was
taken
from
him
to
be
presented
down
below
to
the
state
grand
jury.
the
united
states
of
attorney
was
aware
of
this
possible
federal
violation.
now,
the
federal
agent
had
heard
a
knock
on
that
one
tape
and
he
had
seen
the
notes
accompanying
the
tape
indicating
a
synopsis
of
the
tape,
the
names
of
the
parties
to
the
conversations,
and
year
at
that
time
or
later,
the
fbi
agent
talked
to
one
of
the
parties
langley
and
learned
that
he
had
not
given
any
consent
to
the
interception
of
these
messages.
now,
on
the
basis
of
that,
it
was
public
knowledge,
and
that
there
was
a
federal
violation.and
it
was
knowledge
which
the
u.s.
attorney
and
the
fbi
agents
have.
so
the
tapes
wound
up
in
a
state
of
limbo.
they
were
not
suppressed.
they
were
held
in
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
of
oregon.
they
were
there.
they
were
existing.
and
on
that
basis,
the
fbi
agent
went
to
the
state
authorities
and
asked
permission
again
to
listen
to
the
tapes
which
he
did
on
august
the
13th,
1956.
following
a
complete
audit
of
the
tapes
on
which
he
testified,
he
could
tell
because
of
the
background
noises
of
the
conversation
and
of
the
wire
noises
that
they
were
intercepts,
they
were
not
recordings
made
outside
of
the
telephone
system,
he
then
sworn
out
a
federal
warrant,
and
on
that
basis,
on
september
the
5th,
secured
the
tapes
from
the
custody
of
the
state.
that
warrant,
i
think,
is
unquestionably
based
on
personal
knowledge
of
the
agent,
it
was
based
on
all
the
information
available,
and
it
was
clearly
set
forth
in
that
warrant.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
think
it
is
true
that
it's
unequivocal,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
there's
any
contradictory
testimony
on
that.
i
don't
think
any
point
is
made
of
that.
i
think
in
this
case,
there
is
clearly
no
inspiration
by
the
state
people
or
the
federal
people
at
all
anywhere
in
the
record.
i
think
that
is
clear.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
no.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
there
is
no
prior
practice
or
in
any
case
of
this
kind.
and
there
is
nothing
more
than
the
usual
cooperation
between
officials
that
pertains
the
country
over
that
if
they
discover
evidence
of
a
violation
in
the
other
jurisdiction,
the
other
sovereignty,
they
will
make
available
that
information.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
think
that's
right.
there
is
also
evidence
that
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
did
not
recall
that.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
the
relevancy
is,
your
honor,
to
show
the
wisdom
of
not
having
any
exclusionary
rule
in
the
federal
courts
when
there
--
a
hassle
is
going
on
between
state
officers
and
state
courts,
and
that
there
are
definite
abuses
of
the
state
judicial
process
in
that
course
because
if
the
federal
government
is
in
anyway
bound
or
determined
by
the
illegality
of
any
action
as
a
judge
in
the
state
courts
or
if
the
state
law
is
held
to
be
determinative
in
the
federal
court,
the
federal
government
will
not
be
unfeathered
in
its
prosecution
of
federal
offenses.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
think
you
could
perhaps.
and
i
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
it's
just
as
horrible.
but
i
submit
it
does
not
lead
to
the
opposite
conclusion.
i
submit
respectfully
that
it
supports
our
conclusion
of
the
silver
platter
doctrine
is
a
wise
doctrine
because
it
does
not
force
the
united
states
district
judge
to
examine
into
the
legality
or
illegality
of
the
seizure
by
state
officers.
if
the
united
states
district
judge
had
inquired
into
all
of
these
things,
he
might
have
been
found
as
we
--
as
has
been
pointed
out
here
by
both
counsel,
he
might
have
found
horrible
examples
of
misused
of
state
process
on
both
sides,
and
we
take
no
sides
in
this.
and
so
we
submit
that
not
require
--
the
rule
which
doesn't
require
a
united
states
district
judge
to
inquire
into
the
actions
of
state
officers
or
state
judges
is
a
wise
policy
in
our
federalism.
and
i
--
and
we
think
the
elkins
case
in
those
facts
supported.
that,
i
think,
is
--
is
the
realms
of
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
the
people
who
were
indicted,
the
witness,
federal
witnesses
who
were
indicted
but
never
convicted,
were
in
addition
to
langley,
lonergan.
that
was
introduced
in
the
trial
as
an
impeachment
at
volume
7,
pages
1301
to
1322,
it
was
dismissed.
by
the
way,
he
was
called
for
testimony,
april
the
30th,
he
was
indicted
april
the
29th,
and
then
the
indictment
was
used
in
impeachment
in
his
cross-examination,
then
schrunk,
howlett
and
minielly
were
all
named
and
one
of
the
indictments
of
langley
which
was
used
in
impeachment.
that's
found
in
the
record
in
this
case.
there
are
three
pages,
three
citations
here,
volume
10,
16,
7
--
pages
1617
to
1618,
and
then
in
the
same
volume,
pages
1709
to
1729.
and
then
schrunk,
howlett
and
minielly
were
also
indicted.
they
testified
--
schrunk
testified
april
27th
and
29th.
there
were
five
indictments
against
him,
the
last
one
being
on

i
--
i
have
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
certified
copies
of
the
indictments
in

i
offer
these
--
some
of
these
are
already
in
the
record
as
far
as
the
indictments.
i
offer
them
to
show
the
other
indictments
i
mentioned
and
also
to
show
the
disposition
on
these
as
i've
stated
them
as
to
their
dismissal
or
in

case
an
acquittal,
may
they
be

by
the
clerk.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
this
point
was
not
argued
in
the
district
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
district
judge
proceeded
on
the
silver
platter
doctrine
that
he
didn't
have
to
examine
into
these
things.
and
we
are
arguing
on
the
basis
of
these
facts
that
the
decision
not
to
inquire
into
these
was
wise
and
the
reason
that
it's
wise
is
because
of
these
things
which
took
place
in
the
state
process
in
connection
and
in
relation
to
this
federal
trial
and
the
indictment
of
the
various
federal
witnesses.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
not
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
not
at
all,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
the
silver
platter
doctrine
is
a
wise
policy
and
that
it
should
--
that
no
united
states
district
judge
or
this
court
should
be
obliged
to
inquire
into
the
actions
of
state
officials
and
pass
judgment
on
the
way
or
another.
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
here,
the
federal
process
being
followed
by
the
federal
warrant,
we
should
be
allowed
to
take
the
evidence
and
offer
it
on
the
federal
prosecution
unhampered,
unhindered
by
whatever
the
state
officials
did.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
they
were
used
for
impeachment
and
i
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
and
i
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that
issue
was
not
argued
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
before
as
i'll
explain
it.
that's
right.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
some
of
them
are
but
the
other
indictments
are
part
of
the
picture,
and
i'm
offering
all
of
them
to
show
the
whole
picture
and
to
show
that
they
were
dismissed
at
a
later
date.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
was
planning
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
was
planning
to
say
something
about
that
in
the
rios'
argument
but
i
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
can't
now.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
shall
in
--
in
rios.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
yes.
i
note
the
petitioner
here
said
yesterday
that
the
adoption
of
his
theory
would
require
the
overruling
of
burdeau
against
mcdowell,
center
and
that
portion
of
weeks.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
now,
i
want
to
get
to
the
problem
which
the
chief
justice
asked
me
to
discuss
before
concluding,
and
that
is
the
problem
of
the
legality
of
the
state
search
warrant
here.
i
believe
that
was
it.
now,
we
have
here
an
affidavit
by
langley
which
is
based
on
his
knowledge
obtained
from
what
we
think
is
a
far
more
reliable
source
than
an
unnamed
informer
which
is
present
in
the
jones
case,
and
that
is
from
the
chief
of
police
in
the
town
of
st.
helens,
oregon.
now,
the
evident
shows
that
the
defendant
or
petitioner
clark
here
was
the
former
chief
of
police
in
st.
helens.
and
therefore,
the
chief
of
--
i
heard
there,
the
chief
of
police
would
be
a
logical
source
who
know
would
something
about
clark's
activities.
now,
the
evidence
shows
that
langley,
in
addition
to
the
source
of
information,
being
chief
herder,
which
he
named
in
the
affidavit,
langley
had
previous
confidential
information
of
the
same
sort
in
regard
to
clark
and
elkins.
then
the
reporter,
brad
williams,
came
to
langley
with
the
same
information
from
different
sources.
then
through
the
device
of
a
telephone
call
placed
by
williams
with
langley
listening
in,
he
got
from
chief
herder
the
details
of
this.
herder,
police
chief,
not
only
supposed
to
be
reliable
but
had
special
reason
for
knowing
these
facts,
having
been
clark's
successor.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
that's
what
he
stated
on
the
witness
stand,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
--
i'll
point
this
out,
and
it's
very
important
in
the
record
on
the
state
of
evidence
in
this
case.
langley
contradicted
herder
on
that
point.
langley
says
chief
herder
did
not
tell
me
that
this
was
hearsay
and
i
presume
he
was
speaking
from
his
own
knowledge.
furthermore,
there's
only
one
other
witness
who
could
have
--
who
could
have
contradicted
--
who
could
have
supported
the
petitioner's
version
and
that
was
a
newspaper
reporter,
brad
williams,
and
he
was
not
called.
he
was
in
the
courtroom
and
available
but
he
was
not
called.
now,
herder
also
says
that
he
didn't
know
that
langley
was
listening
in
on
the
telephone
and
he
tries
to
imply
as
the
petitioner's
counsel
here
that
langley
never
listened
in
on
the
call.
but
again,
only
langley
and
williams
would
know
if
langley
ruined
the
extension
telephone
and
williams,
the
witness,
who
was
available
and
could
have
been
called
was
not
called,
and
langley's
testimony
that
he
did
listen
in,
stands
uncontradicted
on
this
record.
the
government
didn't
need
him
because
there
was
no
contradiction
and
herder
couldn't
contradict
him.
if
williams
would
have
testified
differently,
petitioners
could
have
and
undoubtedly
would
have
called.
so
langley,
in
good
faith,
took
the
information
he
gained
from
herder
over
the
telephone.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
don't
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i'm
not
sure
that
williams
urged
langley
to
have
the
search
warrant
issued.
and
i
would
point
out
that
langley
said
that
williams
was
the
second
source
of
information
that
he
had
on
this.
and
that
he
acted
on
the
basis
of
that
information
after
he
had
confirmed
williams'
information
by
the
telephone
call
to
herder.
now,
the
--
i'm
--
my
time
has
expired,
mr.
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
--
chief
justice.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
i
would
emphasize
that
--
and
this
is
very
important,
i
think,
on
the
rational
of
the
court
in
the
jones
case,
as
i
read
that
opinion,
on
the
bottom
of
page
14
and
the
top
of
page
15
of
the
slip
opinion
in
the
middle
of
page
12,
it's
very
important
here
that
langley
didn't
have
any
ex
parte
action
by
police
officers
without
a
warrant.
langley
went
to
a
local
magistrate
and
got
a
warrant
on
the
basis
of
his
information.
and
on
thursday
night,
that
local
magistrate
thought
the
warrant
was
good.
by
monday
morning,
he
changed
his
mind
but
at
first,
langley
proceeded
by
warrant
and
he
proceeded
on
the
information
from
a
police
chief
who
was
in
special
situation
to
know
and
he
named
his
source
in
the
affidavit.
and
we
think
on
the
standards
of
the
jones
case
and
on
draper
that
that
is
--
meets
the
federal
standard.
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
submit
that
it
was
fully
litigated
below,
that
in
the
district
court,
the
ruling
which
was
made
by
the
district
judge
was
merely
to
--
to
inform
counsel
that
he
was
proceeding
on
the
silver
platter
doctrine
and
that
following
--
and
that
therefore,
he
was
not
going
to
pass
on
the
validity
of
the
federal
warrant
and
he
didn't
but,
that
for
the
record
and
for
the
theory
of
the
case
followed
by
petitioner's
counsel
at
that
time,
petitioner
could
develop
it
for
the
record.
and
it
is
shown
here
--
mr.
malcolm
richard
wilkey
i
would
suspect
it's
around
227
or
228
--
201
and
202.
now,
at
the
bottom
of
201,
the
court
says
“you
may
make
your
record.”
defense
counsel,
mr.
crawford,
“may
i
make
your
--your
record
that
court
to
protect
your
theory
about
it?”
now,
petitioners'
counsel
says
that
nobody
proceeded
on
the
interpretation
that
is
apparent
to
us
there,
in
those
words,
but
at
the
top
of
page
202,
it's
very
apparent
to
us
that
the
district
attorney,
mr.
luckey
proceeded
on
the
same
theory
that
we're
urging
now
that
defense
counsel
could
introduce
evidence
bearing
on
the
validity
of
the
federal
warrant
in
order
to
protect
their
theory
of
the
case.
down
here
where
it
says
by
--
excuse
me,
your
honor,
“by
virtue
of
the
court's
ruling,
i
would
move
to
strike
the
question,
the
answer
is
immaterial.”
that
is
the
question
involving
the
federal
warrant.
however,
under
standing,
of
course,
that
if
he
has
submitted
on
the
basis
of
his
record,
that
it
is
outside
the
record
of
the
court's
consideration,
meaning
the
district
court's
consideration,
and
that's
precisely
what
was
done.
the
record
already
was
full
up
to
that
point
but
it
was
further
developed.
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
passed
on
it
on
petitioners'
urging
as
an
additional
ground
for
the
validity
of
the
evidence
in
question
here.
and
we
submit
that
this
court
can't
affirm
the
conviction
in
this
case
on
the
same
ground
as
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
the
validity
of
the
federal
warrant,
the
situation
confronting
the
federal
officers
at
the
time
they
got
the
federal
warrant.
thank
you
for
your
indulgence,
mr.
chief
justice.
