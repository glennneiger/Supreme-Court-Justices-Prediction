justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
he
was
relying
on
this
hearsay
only?
what
is
meant
by
the
last
clause,
page
24,
in
the
first
paragraph?
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
it
seems
that
he
was
complaining
that
the
excess
things
they
were
searching
for
(inaudible)
that
they
were
searching
photographs
and
there
were
none
found.

the
first
paragraph
on
page
24.
it
ends
up
by
saying
and
that
no
photographs
were
among
the

seized.
he
had
said
that
they
got
the
affidavit
on
the
basis
that
they
were
seeking
photographs.
justice
hugo

he
then
says
no
photographs
were
seized.
how
did
he
know
that,

he
have
evidence?

hugo

what
was
he
using
that
part
to
show
that
the
affidavit
was
illegal
or
that
he
wouldn't
--
the
search
warrant
was
bad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
that
both
indicate
because
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
it
seems
to
be
indicated
there
that
he
was
saying
that
they
had
obtained
this
affidavit
and
search
warrant
on
seeking
photographs
and
that
they
had
no
photographs
and
it
was
there.

photograph

justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
was
a
disagreement
this
morning
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
facts
and
i
think
justice
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
emphasized
that,
we
were
deciding
it
on
the
facts
of
that
as
whether
or
not
was
probable
cause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
