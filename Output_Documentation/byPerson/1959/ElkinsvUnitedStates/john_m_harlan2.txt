justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
in
light
of
the
--
in
light
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
what
i
mean
is
assuming
one
accepts
the
view
that
under
state
law,
the
seizure
was
illegal,
is
it
open
to
the
federal
court
to
reexamine
the
seizure
for
the
purposes
of
admissibility,
leaving
aside
silvers
platter
for
a
moment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that,
but
the
evidence
is
being
sought
to
be
admitted
in
the
federal
prosecution.
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
though
wisely
or
unwisely,
this
case
was
litigated
below
on
the
silver
platter
theory.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
not
true?
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
now
urging
us
here
now,
strike
that
to
â€“
decide
it
without
reaching
that
question?(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
the
next
question
i
want
to
ask
you
at
having
been
decided
on
the
silver
platter
premise,
rightly
or
wrongly,
is
the
record
in
such
shape
that
we
could
do
that
without
sending
the
case
back?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
that
schrunk,
the
county
sheriff
or
whoever
he
was,
the
state
official
sent
for
the
--
sent
for
the
united
states
attorney
or
the
fbi
and
asking
to
look
at
these
records.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
i
understand
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
maybe
mistaken.
i
--
maybe
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
on
--
being
point
out
to
by
my
co-counsel
here.
that
is
true.
i'm
sorry
if
i
misstated
it.
i
did
not
want
to
--
i
do
not
want
to
overstate
this
case.
there
is
no
need
to.
this
is
a
clear
case
of
complete
innocence
on
the
federal
government's
part.
i
think
the
testimony
is
that
before
any
communication
from
schrunk
or
anybody
else
in
the
state
side,
the
fbi
agents
had
seen
the
testimony
or
seen
the
report
of
the
raid
in
the
newspapers
and
were
discussing
it
in
their
office,
as
to
whether
or
not
a
federal
violation
was
involved.
and
as
i
was
about
to
say,
one
of
the
state
authorities,
it
may
have
langley
wrote
a
letter
to
the
attorney
general
of
oregon
and
to
the
federal
authorities
and
to
someone
else
to
the
telephone
company
notifying
them
of
the
seizure
of
these
tapes
which
indicated
interceptions
in
violation
of
both
state
and
federal
law.
i
do
not
wish
to
overstate
my
case
here
because
it's
a
good
one
without
any
elaboration
or
whatever,
but
here
--
this
is
a
situation
confronting
the
federal
authorities.
and
in
--
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
pointed
out
yesterday
in
a
question,
would
the
bungling
or
purposeful
misuse
of
process
by
a
state
court
forever
bar
the
federal
government?
now
here,
the
petitioner
elkins
has
accused
district
attorney
langley
of
purposefully
misusing
state
process.
i
make
no
brief
for
one
side
or
another
in
this
power
struggle
between
these
people
in
oregon.
but
if
that
is
true,
if
there
was
a
purposeful
misuse
of
process
here,
abuse
of
process
by
the
state
district
attorney,
should
that
forever
bar
the
federal
government
from
prosecuting
an
apparent
federal
violation
here?
we
submit
that
the
federal
government
proceeded
in
the
only
way
that
it
could
have,
that
is,
it
got
out
a
warrant
and
it
went
to
the
place
where
the
tapes
where,
and
it
took
the
tapes
under
that
warrant
and
then
proceeded
to
present
the
evidence
to
a
federal
grand
jury.
i
--
the
--
because
of
the
nature
of
the
state
court's
rulings,
these
tapes
were
in
a
sort
of
limbo.
they
were
instruments
of
crime
under
both
oregon
and
federal
law,
able
decided
yesterday,
they
were
the
fruits
of
crime,
they
could
not
be
returned
to
the
petitioners
elkins
and
clark.
they
were
going
to
be
held
in
state
custody,
and
so
the
united
states
proceeded
in
the
only
way
it
could.
now,
i'm
reminded
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
comment
yesterday
that
this
--
that
this
action
took
place
by
people
who
were
not
in
the
same
household.
and
that
is
very
clear
on
this
record.
the
federal
authorities
were
not
in
the
same
household
with
the
state
people.
and
i'm
reminded
of
mr.
justice
holmes
remarks
in
the
silverthorne
case,
where
it
--
where
he
said
for
the
court
that
if
knowledge
of
them,
the
facts,
is
gained
from
an
independent
source,
they
maybe
proved
like
any
others,
but
the
knowledge
gained
by
the
government's
own
wrong
cannot
be
used
by
it.
here,
there
is
no
own
wrong
by
the
government
in
any
way.
and
here,
we
have
to
take
the
situation
as
it
is
and
proceed
in
accordance
with
the
due
process
of
a
federal
court.
we
submit
that
on
the
facts
which
came
out
yesterday
in
argument
and
on
the
facts
which
i'll
go
into
later,
that
on
a
situation
like
this,
the
wisdom,
the
policy
of
wisdom
is
to
allow
the
federal
district
judge
free
and
unfeathered
choice
of
the
evidence
not
being
bound
by
any
actions
which
may
have
been
taken
place
either
by
state
police
officers
or
by
rulings
of
the
state
judiciary.
this
is,
as
i
will
develop
later,
an
example
of
attempted
frustration
of
federal
process
merely
by
an
abuse
of
state
judicial
process.
and
i
think
that
these
facts
provide
the
strongest
practical
argument
for
not
applying
a
rigid
exclusionary
rule.
on
a
rational
of
the
abatte
decision,
written
for
the
court
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
stated
that
the
basic
--
this
dealt
of
course
with
double
jeopardy,
but
the
reasoning
here
on
the
fifth
and
fourth
amendments,
i
think,
the
reasoning
is
close
and
similar.
the
basic
dilemma
was
recognized
over
a
century
ago
in
fox
versus
ohio
as
it
was
there
pointed
out,
if
the
states
are
free
to
prosecute
criminal
acts
violating
their
laws
and
a
result
on
state
prosecution
to
bar
federal
prosecutions
based
on
the
same
acts,
federal
law
enforcement
must
necessarily
be
hindered.
and
again,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
feldman
case,
the
government
here
is
not
seeking
to
benefit
by
evidence
which
it
extorted.
and
that's
certainly
true
here
and
in
the
later
--
in
the
opinion
for
the
court.
otherwise,
the
criminal
law
of
the
united
states
would
be
at
the
hazard
of
carelessness
or
connivance
in
some
petty
civil
litigation
in
any
state
court,
quite
beyond
the
reach
of
the
most
alert
watchfulness
by
the
law
officers
of
the
government.
now,
i'm
reminded
of
the
fact
that
in
the
abatte
opinion,
in
footnote
7,
in
citing
courts
of
appeals
cases
where
the
state
prosecution
did
not
bar
subsequent
federal
prosecution.
this
court,
through
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion,
first
cited
the
rios
case,
which
is
set
for
argument
immediately
following
this
one.
now,
in
rios,
we
had
a
situation
in
which
there
was
a
seizure
which
was
ruled
illegal
by
the
state
courts.
that,
in
the
state
trial
under
state
procedure
resulted
in
an
acquittal
without
any
possibility
of
appeal
by
the
state.
now,
then
on
--
on
the
abatte
case,
the
federal
government
would
be
free
to
prosecute
without
any
question
of
jeopardy
arising.
and
here
we
have
in
rios,
a
situation
where
the
question
is
not
under
the
fifth
amendment
but
the
question
involves
the
same
identical
package
of
narcotics
under
the
question
of
search
and
seizure.
and
so
i
submit
that
the
logic,
the
same
logic
that
applies
to
one
applies
to
another
that
the
federal
government
should
not
be
barred
in
its
use
of
the
evidence
obtained
by
the
acts
of
state
officers
anymore
under
the
fourth
amendment
than
it
would
be
barred
by
a
state
court
acquittal
based
on
the
suppression
of
the
evidence
under
the
fifth.
i
think
the
reasoning
is
parallel.
now,
in
--
it's
been
referred
to
in
the
petitioners'
brief
about
the
conviction
of
the
district
attorney
langley
here
on
a
misdemeanor
charge
and
his
removal
from
office.
again,
i
emphasize
the
federal
government
here
nowise
has
taken
any
sides
in
the
struggle
in
oregon.
and
we
think
the
wisdom
is
manifested.
but
i
want
to
call
to
the
court
the
opinion
in
state
versus
langley,
cited
by
petitioner
in
323
pacific
and
give
you
the
circumstance
of
that
conviction.
incidentally,
in
addition
to
the
indictment
and
conviction
of
langley,
there
was
the
indictment
of
seven
other
federal
witnesses,
four
of
them
state
officers
who
appeared
and
testified
in
federal
courts,
those
indictments
in
coming
--
coming
just
before
or
during
the
federal
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
and
some
of
them
being
introduced
in
the
record
in
this
case
for
purposes
of
impeachment.
nine
of
those
other
indictments
resulted
in
a
conviction.
only
one,
i
think,
went
to
trial.
there
was
an
acquittal,
all
the
rest
were
dismissed.
but
now,
as
to
mr.
langley's
conviction
on
a
misdemeanor
charge,
that
misdemeanor
indictment
was
returned
10
days
after
the
federal
indictment
in
elkins.
secondly,
langley
state
trial
in
all
of
these
facts
are
from
the
opinion
in
the
pacific
reporter.
langley
state
trial
began
april
the
9th,
1957,
the
very
same
day
that
elkins
motion
to
suppress
evidence
came
on
for
hearing
in
the
u.s.
court.
thirdly,
while
waiting
in
the
state
judges
chambers
for
the
trial,
during
a
recess,
langley
was
arrested
on
two
new
state
indictments.
fourthly,
at
same
day,
there
were
five
column
and
eight
column
headlines
in
the
portland
newspapers
telling
of
the
district
attorney's
arrest
while
on
the
very
day,
he
went
to
trial
in
the
misdemeanor
case
on
which
he
was
convicted.
fifthly,
television
cameras
were
in
the
judges'
chambers,
photographed
the
arrest
of
langley,
and
they
were
shown
on
three
news
programs
that
night,
the
day
he
went
to
trial.
sixthly,
cameramen
permitted
--
were
permitted
to
take
pictures
from
within
the
courtroom
railing
during
the
testimony
of
petitioner
elkins
against
langley
contrary
to
rule
69
of
the
state
court
rules.
seventhly,
a
photographer
was
permitted
to
stand
beside
the
jury
box
to
take
25
still
picture
of
langley's
defense
counsel
during
his
closing
argument.
eighthly,
the
trial
judge
presiding
in
this
trial
was
the
same
circuit
judge
who
ruled
that
the
seizure
of
these
tapes
of
illegal
and
turn
the
tapes
over
to
the
state
attorney
general.
now,
that
was
the
way
which
mr.
langley
was
convicted.
i
will
add
that
this
was
a
state
trial
of
course.
it
was
affirmed
by
the
oregon
supreme
court.
certiorari
was
sought
and
denied
by
this
court,
which
i
take
it
merely
means
that
for
--
there
were
no
federal
question
involved
or
there
are
more
important
cases
demanding
the
court's
attention
and
in
nowise,
it
constituted
a
ruling
by
this
court
approving
the
opinion
below
in
the
state
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down.
what
do
you
say
to
colonel
wiener's
argument
as
regards
to
the
federal
warrant
which
you
should
not
be
permitted
to
litigate
that
here
since
it
--
it's
not
fully
litigated
below?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
what
page
is
that
on?
