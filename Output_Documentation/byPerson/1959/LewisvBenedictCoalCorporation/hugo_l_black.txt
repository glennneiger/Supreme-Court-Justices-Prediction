57.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
union
had
given
something
or
note
of
$100,000
and
the
company
was
$100,000
behind
on
payment
to
this
fund,
did
they
told
you
that
it's
not
due
on
this
note
to
be
offset?
justice
hugo

black
benedict.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
union
itself
at
that
time
has
given
a
note
of
$100,000
in
five
months
to
benedict?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
union
has
--
has
come
to
benedict
saying,
“i'm
owing
you
a
$100,000
at
all
the
time.
and
if
i'm
sued
for
the
$100,000
because,”
could
you
offset
that
from
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
think
benedict
owed
them
30
cents
a
ton?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
finally
is
there
that
the
trust
fund
can
be
made
to
pay
damages
on
account
of
the
union's
conduct
even
though
it's
not
in
the
negative
with
the
particular
amount
due
or
to
the
fund.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
get
a
judgment
against
the
union
itself?
justice

it
collectible?

entirely
on
the

it
was
the
violation

do
you

they've
refused
him

you
think
that

that's
right.
justice

do
you

you
think
that
the
history
is
relevant
as
judge
madden

i
don't
mean
to
have
the

do
you

(inaudible)
justice

your

your
argument
is
that

itself
has
to
be
as
showed
in

yes.
justice

converse
to

it

said
this,
they
could
have
said
also,
all
that
--
although
they
have
taken
out
the
part
of
the
strike,
they
were
going
to
include
in
here
that
that
is
a
breach

if
they
did
strike
for
these
reasons.
you
