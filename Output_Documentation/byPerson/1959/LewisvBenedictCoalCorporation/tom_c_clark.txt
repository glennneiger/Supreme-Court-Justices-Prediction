your
argument
that
there
was,
there
can
never
be
anything
owing.
justice
tom
c.
clark
similar
to
the
argument
that
was
made
this
week
in
certain
mechanic
lien
and
spaces
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
claim
that
here
the
contract
instead
of
being
created
by
law,
i
mean
the
trustee,
instead
of
being
created
by
law,
it
was
created
by
the
contract.
justice
tom
c.
clark
never
is
anything
owing
to
anybody
except
the
trustees
so
far
as
that
particular
part
of
the
payment
is
concerned.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
your
argument.
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
fact,
if
that's
not
the
case,
is
your
case
strong?
does
it
have
to
be
there
in
order
for
you
to
win?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
do
you
mean
the
company
has
money
and
could
pay
it?
you
do
not
mean
that
the
company
has
a
segregated
fund.
justice
tom
c.
clark
because
it's
segregated
by
this
contract
if
it
is
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
has
to
be
enough
all
the
time
there
your
argument
is
to
pay
your
people
if
they
break
their
--
breach
their
trust.
justice
tom
c.
clark
after
that
has
occurred?
justice
tom
c.
clark
not
as
a
debtor.
and
what
do
they
owe
you,
they
owe
you
because
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
they
build
these
trustees
and
therefore
they
really
a
tort
you're
suing
them,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
same
with
your
property
from
the
contract
done
