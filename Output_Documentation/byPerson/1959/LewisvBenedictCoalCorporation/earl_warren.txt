a
moment

chief

now
mr.
kramer,
you

proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
a
matter
–
just
a
matter
of
curiosity
how
are
the
trustees
appointed
under
this
particular
trust?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
boiarsky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
we'd
finish
the
argument
on
this
side
before
we
--
before
we
adjourn,
if
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
recess
now
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
winston,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
happened
with
contract.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
the
then
--
for
an
obligation
that
came
out
of
the
contract
before
this
happened.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
note
said
that
they
would
pay
$100,000
in,
let
us
say,
three
years,
could
they
hold
up
the
--
the
30
cents
per
ton
for
three
years
until
that
note
was
paid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
only
on
the
ground
it
was
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
talking
about
--
did
the
company
hold
that
payments
looking
towards
the
eventual
setoff?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
now,
let
me
ask
--
let
me
ask
you
this
one,
how
long
had
it
been
since
the
company
had
made
payments
on
--
to
the
trust
fund
prior
to
the
--
the
judgments
in
the
trial
court
of
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
the
judgment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there
was
nothing
paid
under
this
trust
agreement
from
--
from
june
1953
until
1956?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
inquire
in
this
curiosity?
approximately
how
much
coal
benedict
mined
in
those
three
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
you
settle
the
stoppage
if
there
was
a
stoppage?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
you
say
that
this
--
this
machinery
shall
--
shall
govern
all
stoppages.
now,
the
machinery
doesn't
say
anything
about
any
stoppage.
but
why
would
it
be
necessary
to
say
the
machinery
would
be
used
to
--
to
remedy
any
stoppages
if
the
contract
didn't
contemplate
that
there
might
be
stoppages?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
it
--
it
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
if
there
was
a
stoppage,
it
must
be
--
it
must
be
remedied
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
through
this
procedure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
--
then
doesn't
the
--
doesn't
that
use
of
the
word
“stoppages”
there
imply
that
--
that
under
this
--
this
contract
there
--
there
might
be
stoppages?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then,
if
they
do,
the
procedure
would
be,
i
take
it,
as
you
argued
that
--
that
they
would
proceed
under
the
--
under
the
procedure
set
out
in
this
contract
to
work
out
at
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
company.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
where
do
you
--
where
do
you
get
the
idea
then
that
they
--
that
they
cannot
strike?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
that
is
contemplated
in
your
contract.
where
do
you
get
the
--
the
idea
from
the
contract
that
they
cannot
strike?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
but
you've
got
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you've
got
one
clause
in
there
that's
very
definite
which
says
that
the
--
the
previous
non-strike
provision
of
the
old
contract
is
cancelled
and
annulled,
vacate
it
and
whatever
other
language
they
--
they
use.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
so
far
as
that
is
concern,
they
do
have
the
right
to
--
to
strike.
and
unless
your
other
provisions
of
the
contract
restrict
them
to
do
this
procedure
that
you
have
set
out
and
i
take
they
would
have
the
right,
do
they
not,
to
--
to
strike
and
have
the
grievance
--
grievance
settled
under
that
procedure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
of
your
own
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
make
any
difference,
mr.
winston,
if
the
union
who
was
insolvent
and
couldn't
pay
its
$81,000
in
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would
not
be
--
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
setoff
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
if
--
if
the
union
could
not
pay
anything
into
the
--
into
the
court
satisfactory
of
the
judgment,
then
your
obligation
to
--
against
the
--
to
the
fund
could
still
extinguished?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record,
mr.
winston,
to
indicate
why
the
no-strike
clause
was
eliminated
or
must
be
taken
just
on
the
--
on
a
language
of
the
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
is
mr.
boyle?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
afraid
your
time
is
up,
mr.
--
mr.
winston.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
from
your
brief,
i
guess.
