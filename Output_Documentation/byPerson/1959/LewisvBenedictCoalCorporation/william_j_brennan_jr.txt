was
this
as
a
matter
of
law
or
as
a
matter
of
the
contract
provision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
in
essence
the
contract
gives
you
this
right
of
action
over
against
the
employer
or
without
regard
to
any
action
an
employer
might
have
against
the
union
--
the
other
party
of
the
union
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
went
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
other
thing.
is
there
anything
in
the
record,
indicate
when
the
$76,000
obligation
arose
as
to
coal
produced
in
--
with
reference
to
the
time
of
the
first
strike,
was
before
or
after
that
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
would
your
position
be
any
different
if
the
full
amount
of
this
claim
of
seventy
six
odd
thousand
dollars
were
due
and
owing
the
trustees
before
the
first
strike?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
be
different.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
--
in
that
situation,
you
would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
would
not
have
settled.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
month
after
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
that
were
not
the
fact,
then
it
had
--
this
obligation
had
accrued
before
the
first
strike,
did
i
understand
you
could
say
then
you
do
not
believe
you
could
assert
to
settle?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
as
--
then
as
the
record
comes
to
us
so
we'd
understand
that
as
a
fact,
the
finding
is
that
at
the
time
this
money
became
due
and
owing,
the
union
was
in
default.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
in
this
regard,
mr.
winston?
is
there
some
time
schedule
in
the
contract
with
--
dealing
with
the
detail
of
how
payments
are
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
then
payment
is
in
respect
to
coal
produced
in
the
previous
month,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
it
help
you
at
page
15a,
mr.
winston,
the
allegation
is
the
complaint
in
this
regard?s
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
wound
up
also
your
consideration
of
the
application
of
section
301
(b)?
as
i
understand
it,
there's
another
argument
here
based
on
section
301
(b)
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
namely,
that
since
that
section
says
that
any
money
judgment
against
the
labor
organization
shall
be
enforceable
only
against
the
organization
and
its
assets,
the
words
to
that
effect,
that
this
is
itself
a
bar
to
a
--
the
setoff
that
you
were
given
below.i
think
that's
what
the
trustee
is
arguing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see.
in
other
words,
you
mean
that
the
form
that
this
took
below
was
in
effect
is
that
you
are
collecting
your
judgment,
benedict
is
collecting
its
judgment
from
the
union
this
81
thousand
odd
dollars
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
or
whatever
finally
is
determined
to
be.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
order
is
that
the
trustees'
judgment
against
benedict
shall
be
paid
out
of
that
sum,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
your
answer
then
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
trustee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whatever
it
may
be,
mr.
winston,
we
have
to
determine
this
issue
on
the
facts
that
you
just
given
us,
namely,
that
what
the
district
court
did
was
to
order
the
union
to
pay
the
amount
of
the
judgment
you
obtained
against
the
union
in
the
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then,
that
ordered
that
the
trustees'
judgment
should
be
collected
from
those
moneys
paid
by
the
union
of
the
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
upon
that
set
of
facts
that
we'll
have
to
determine
the
applicability
or
non-applicability
of
this
section.
