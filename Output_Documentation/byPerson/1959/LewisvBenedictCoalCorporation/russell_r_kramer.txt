mr.
russell
r.
kramer
to
the
honorable
mr.
chief
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
pardon
me.
i'm
just
trying
to
say
that
--
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
all
the
chief
justices,
and
may
it
please
this
court.
this
action
originated
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
tennessee
by
the
suit
instituted
by
the
trustees
of
the
welfare
and
retirement
fund
of
the
united
mine
workers
of
america,
seeking
to
collect
or
to
obtain
from
this
settlor
of
a
trust,
certain
moneys
that
the
settlor
had
retained,
under
our
tradition,
the
amount
of
those
moneys
being
$76,000.
the
defendant
who
was
the
--
which
was
the
settlor
of
the
trust,
the
benedict
coal
corporation
in
an
answer
to
the
petition
or
the
bill
complaint
as
filed,
took
the
position
first
that
because
of
certain
conditions
which
were
expressed
in
the
contract
under
which
the
trust
was
created,
there
could
not
be
any
liability,
taking
the
position
that
the
trustees
were
third
party's
beneficiaries,
third-party
beneficiaries
to
the
trust
agreement.
that
there
had
been
a
breach
of
the
trust
agreement
that
or
breach
of
the
contract
of
which
the
trust
agreement
is
a
part,
and
that
by
the
reason
of
the
alleged
breach
there
could
be
no
recovery
by
the
trustees
for
the
funds
or
of
the
funds
which
were
held
by
the
settlor.
the
--
they
also
took
the
position,
the
defendant
did,
that
it
was
entitled
to
a
counterclaim
for
moneys
which
had
heretofore
been
paid
under
the
trust
agreement.
that
question
is
out
of
the
case
and
we're
no
interested
in
it.
it
also
filed
a
cross
claim
against
the
union,
united
mine
workers
of
america,
which
was
a
party
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
in
the
collective
bargain
agreement,
the
trust
agreement
is
set
forth.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
it
has
impleaded
in
the
cross-claim
and
severed
processes
had
upon
it
your
honor.
and
that
impleading
was
done
upon
the
basis
of
that
claim
was
that
under
the
act
which
authorized,
the
act
of
congress
which
authorized
the
creation
of
this
trust,
there
is
a
provision
that
a
violation
of
the
contract
collective
bargaining
agreement
gives
a
right
of
action
and
if
they
are
asserting
that
they
have
a
right
of
action
against
the
union
that
is
the
settlor
of
the
trust,
the
employer
here,
the
coal
operator
and
that
they
â€“
the
settlor
has
a
right
of
action
against
the
union
because
said
the
settlor,
the
coal
operator.
the
union
violated
the
agreement
in
that
there
were
certain
strikes
occurred
during
the
period
of
the
contract.
and
the
right,
the
suit
as
it's
instituted
or
the
kind
of
cross
action
as
instituted
is
based
directly
upon
the
federal
statute
or
rights
granted
by
the
federal
statute.
the
original
action
is
based
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
court
is
diversity
of
citizenship
and
the
amount
involved
several
act
of
congress
is
not
involved.
there
was
a
trial
of
course
for
a
jury
and
then
the
verdict
has
rendered
by
the
jury,
the
jury
found
under
the
instructions
of
the
trial
judge
that
the
settlor
hold
or
had
in
possession
$76,000
in
round
three
years,
a
money
that
belonged
to
these
trustees
and
that
the
trustees
were
entitled
to
have
that
and
recover
that
money.
however,
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
it
should
also
determine
from
the
proof
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
breach
of
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
the
union
in
that
certain
strikes
had
occurred
which
the
court
said
the
jury
could
find
were
a
violation
of
the
contract
and
if
the
jury
found
that
there
were
strikes
which
had
occurred
which
were
violative
of
the
contract,
the
jury
should
ascertain
the
amount
of
damage
that
the
company,
the
settlor,
had
suffered
as
a
result
of
these
illegal
strikes,
they
found
it
to
be
illegal
and
the
jury
found
that
the
amount
of
damage
that
the
company
had
suffered
was
$81,000
in
round
figures.
so
that
the
verdict
to
the
jury
as
returned
was
that
there
is
$76,000
due
under
the
terms
of
the
trust
of
the
trustees.
there's
$81,000
due
from
the
union
as
damages
to
the
operator
or
the
settlor
who
was
also
the
settlor
of
the
trust.
upon
that
type
of
verdict,
we
made
motion
for
the
entry
of
a
judgment
then
in
accordance
with
the
verdict,
rendering
judgment
as
we
sought
for
the
trustees
for
$76,000
plus
interest
from
the
day
the
institution
of
the
action
and
on
which
execution
could
be
awarded
and
that
the
$81,000
be
rendered
to
the
judgment
against
the
union
in
favor
of
the
company.
the
court
declined
to
enter
that
judgment
and
the
court
said
in
substance
and
so
entered
its
judgment
that
there
should
be
a
setoff
of
the
$81,000
which
the
union,
which
was
the
amount
of
the
verdict
against
the
union
and
which
the
company
was
entitled
to
recover
against
the
$76,000,
which
the
trustees
were
entitled
to
recover,
resulting
of
course
that
the
judgment
awarded
in
favor
of
the
trustees
under
their
trust
was
entirely
wiped
out,
and
that
there
would
be
an
additional
amount
payable
by
the
union
of
some
$4,000
or
$5,000
to
the
company,
the
settlor
of
the
trust.
that
is
the
real
question
in
this
lawsuit
as
it
goes
on
through
and
it
is
the
question
before
your
honors
today.
now
it
is
our
position
first
of
course
that
there
was
no
illegal
strike
and
that
there
were
no
damages
which
of
course
have
been
recovered.
that
part
of
this
case
i
do
not
want
to
argue.
counsel
representing
any
other
action
which
represents
united
mine
workers
of
america
will
present
that
question.
but
it
is
our
position,
it
was
our
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
--
the
trustees
are
not
third
party
beneficiaries
of
this
contract,
but
they
are
trustees
of
a
trust
and
that
this
$76,000
is
trust
fund
that
we
are
entitled
to
this
trust
fund
and
that
our
right
to
that
trust
fund
cannot
be
defeated
by
setoff
or
some
other
action
where
the
union
is
liable.
we
say
that
this
contract
itself
created
a
trust,
the
raise
of
which
is
vested
and
the
right
to
own
and
hold
it
is
vested
in
the
trustees
and
then
it
makes
no
difference
while
we
do
not
think
that
there
was
a
breech
of
this
contract
and
if
any
liability
arose
for
damages
and
that
will
be
presented
to
your
honors.
but
we
take
the
position
that
even
if
there
were
a
violation
of
the
contract,
collective
bargaining
agreement,
if
there
was
an
illegal
strike,
and
incidentally
the
so-called
illegal
strikes
in
number
of
this
case
appears
in
court
lasted
to
a
day
or
day
and
a
half
to
two
or
three
days,
there
were
short
period
durations
that
work
on
damages
only
and
the
jury
found
$81,000
in
damages
float
from
that.
incidentally
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
however
found
that
the
major
damage
is
used
and
the
trial
court
was
entirely
erroneous
and
remanded
the
case
for
a
re-determination
of
the
amount
of
damages
that
could
be
awarded
for
those,
for
that
so-called
breach
of
the
contract.
now
i'm
not
interested
in
that
phase.
i
would
accept
that
if
the
evidence
is
the
same
on
any
retrial
if
there'd
be
a
retrial,
the
amount
of
damage
recoverable
for
the
breach
of
the
contract
could
only
be
$15,000
and
we
would
recover
part
of
our
money
because
the
setoff
wouldn't
wipe
it
all
out
if
you
understand
what
i'm
driving
at.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
well,
not
entirely.
it
could
have
a
result
of
not
--
this
question
not
being
important,
but
it
has
another
result
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
pleadings
as
filed
and
in
the
case
as
tried
and
as
affirmed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
settlor
of
the
trust
or
the
employer
to
do
what
they
did
here.
all
they
need
to
do
to
defeat
our
right
of
action
is
to
prove
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
trust
that
they
suffered
damages,
they
not
--
need
not
inter
plead
the
union
as
a
third
party
defendant
here
and
simply
defeat
our
recovery
by
approving
that
there
was
an
illegal
strike.
now
it
is
true
your
honor
that
if
there
were
no
damages
which
could
be
recovered
in
this
case,
then
there
would
be
no
sum
to
setoff
against
our
claim,
but
we
think
this
question
goes
deeper
than
that.
that
the
very
principle
is
involved
and
which
is
determinative
and
is
a
vital
importance
to
trusts
of
this
type,
of
which
there
are
many,
many
and
thousands,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
are
beneficiaries
of
such
trust
which
are
in
effect
charitable
trusts,
that
it
goes
further
than
just
the
narrow
proposition
here
that
they
might
not
be
entitled
to
recover.
that
the
proposition
that's
squarely
before
your
honors,
today
is,
is
there
a
right
of
setoff?
now
it's
true
that
in
this
case
if
they
could
not
recover,
if
the
settlor
could
not
recover
that
is
against
the
union,
no
damages
could
be
awarded,
they
would
have
nothing
to
set
off
against
us.
to
that
extent
the
other
would
be
determined,
but
we
do
not
think
its
determinative
or
the
question
on
which
your
honors
granted
the
writ
of
certiorari.
the
broad
question
which
your
honors
granted
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
this.
can
--
is
it
proper
even
if
the
union
is
entitled,
is
test
in
damages,
is
it
proper
to
have
a
setoff?
the
real
reason
that
that
maybe
material
if
i'm
going
to
regress
a
moment
again,
in
every
action
wherein
the
trust
brings
a
suit
to
collect
this
raise
in
the
trust.
it
will
be
possible
if
this
court
does
not
pass
upon
this
question
which
we
think
if
squarely
before
it
for
the
company,
the
settlor,
the
employer
to
raise
this
question
that
there
was
a
breach
of
contract.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
it
would
your
honor.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
no
your
honor,
it's
the
question.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
no
your
honor,
it's
the
question
remoot.
i
agree
it
would
then
become
moot
because
there
is
no
controversy,
but
in
the
absence
of
that
settlement
--
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
but
we
think
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
controversy
because
this
issue
is
still
there
on
whether
or
not
the
right
of
setoff
exists.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
well
i
wouldn't
anticipated
that
question
might
be
asked
in
those
but
it
is
our
position
that
this
question
is
still,
it's
not
moot
and
it's
still
before
the
court.
i
do
realize
very
frankly
to
your
honors
that
if
you
hold,
that
if
the
court
should
determine
that
there
was
no
breach
of
the
contract
and
therefore
no
damages
could
possibly
arise
then
of
course
there
could
be
no
setoff.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
i
agree
with
your
honor
and
we're
here
first
therefore
our
questions
which
were
to
be
decided
first
and
we're
entitled
to
the
decision
before
you
reach
the
other
question,
and
i
think
that's
the
logical
answer,
may
it
please
the
court?
i
want
to
go
now
to
this
question
of
the,
whether
not
there
is
a
trust.
the
contract
and
whether
or
not
these
petitioners,
the
plaintiffs
below,
complainants,
were
really
third-party
beneficiaries
in
the
capacity
in
which
they
bring
this
action
to
recover
or
were
they
trustees
of
the
trust?
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
that
is
correct,
it's
the
ultimate
answer,
but
may
it
please
your
honor
the
position
is
taken
by
the
defendants
here
that
if
they
have
to
maintain
this
action
as
third-party
beneficiaries
any
defense
that
could
be
made
by
the
prime
parties
of
the
contract,
the
union
can
--
i
mean
yes
can
be
made
as
against
the
beneficiaries
and
against
the
trustees.
and
we
say
if
they
sue
straight
as
trustees
and
their
right
of
action
is
as
trustees
and
not
as
third-party
beneficiaries,
it
makes
no
difference
what
kind
of
action
might
be
maintained
as
between
the
union
and
the
coal
operator.
in
other
words
what
does
this
contract,
another
section
of
this
collective
bargaining
agreement,
may
it
please
the
court
contains
the
provision,
certain
provisions
with
reference
to
settlement
of
disputes
and
certain
procedures
shall
be
followed.
now
it
is
the
position
that
i
don't
want
to
argue
that
question
but
it
is
the
position
of
the
defendants
your
honor
that
this,
there
were
disputes
between
the
union
and
the
man,
the
miner.
that
those
disputes
were
not
settled
under
the
collective
bargaining
provisions
and
that
when
they
were
not
settled
there
was
a
breach
of
the
contract
and
i
don't
think
there
was,
but
there
was
a
breach
of
the
contract
and
therefore
that
any
rights
that
my
clients
had
in
this
case
are
subservient
to
determination
of
whether
or
not
that
breach
of
the
contract
resulted
in
damages
to
the
operator
and
therefore
if
it
did
such
damages
maybe
set-off
against
our
claim.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
no
your
honor
i'm
afraid
that's
not
entirely
sound.
there
is
a
difference
between
defenses
that
can't
be
made
to
an
action
brought
by
third-party
beneficiaries
to
a
contract
to
recover
on
the
contrary
and
rights
that
can
be
asserted
as
a
defense
against
the
plaintiffs
if
they
are
suing
not
as
third-party
beneficiaries
but
solely
as
trustees
of
a
fund.
in
other
words,
if
they
are
solely
as
trustees
of
the
fund,
which
we
think
they
are
in
this
action,
then
may
it
please
your
honor
it
makes
no
difference
what
violation
of
the
contract
they
may
have
been.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
correct
your
honor.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
because
your
honor
they
assert,
the
defendant
asserts
that
if
they
are
maintaining
this
action
as
third-party
beneficiaries
although
there
are
parties
in
there
that
as
if
they
maintain
their
action
as
third-party
beneficiaries
then
the
defendant
can
setoff
against
any
right
that
the
third
party
beneficiary
has
any
defense
that
he
might
have
--
against
the
claim
between
the
original
parties.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
it
does
your
honor
and
we
stated
under
the
terms
of
the
contract
he
cannot
set
it
up.
it
may
be
that
technically
there
isn't
too
much
difference
between
their
position
as
third
party
beneficiaries
and
trustees,
but
i
think
our
position
is
stronger
and
i'm
strong
in
my
own
personal
belief
that
we
sue
here
as
trustees
in
the
very
capacity
we
seek
to
sue
and
not
as
a
third
party
beneficiary
though
we
are
a
third
party
beneficiary
in
the
trust.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
i
concede
that
your
honor,
i
concede
that.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
i
do.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
it
is.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
that's
correct
your
honor.
that's
our
position.
yes
sir,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
it's
a
matter
of
proper
construction
of
the
contract
provision,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
that's
our
position
your
honor.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
they
do.
let
me
--
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
the
trustees
are
appointed
under
by
--
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
trust,
one,
by
the
operators.
there
are
many,
many
operators,
hundreds
of
operators
who
have
joined
in
this
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
at
least
51%
of
them
have
to
agree
on
one
trustee
who
represents
them.
the
united
mine
workers
of
america
choose
a
second
trustee
and
those
two
choose
a
third
or
neutral
trustee,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
method
of
proving
this,
the
authority
to
establish
this
type
of
trust
is
given
by
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947
and
it
provides
the
method
of
choosing
the
trustees.
now
our
agreement
copies
in
to
it,
those
provisions
of
the
federal
statute
and
provides
that
our
trustees
shall
be
charged
named
accordingly
and
they
are
still
named
here.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
does
not
bear
on
it,
no
it
does
not
bare
on
it
in
the
way
this
case
now
comes
to
your
honors.
at
one
time
there
was
also
a
claim
in
here
a
violation
of
a
secondary
boycott,
which
falls
under
that
act,
but
that
is
eliminated.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
no
sir.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
yes
you
do
in
one
particular,
your
honor
and
i
want
to
come
to
that
in
a
moment
unless
your
honor
prefers
now.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
alright.
now
on
your
record
is
the
record
your
honors
have
in
front
of
you
on
page
94
(a)
of
it,
is
the
provision
with
reference
to,
it
begins
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
93
(a),
the
establishment
of
this
united
mine
workers
of
america
welfare
and
retirement
fund.
now
this
is
a
section
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
you
note
that
near
the
bottom
of
page
93
(a)
it
starts.
it
is
hereby
stipulated
and
agreed
that
contracting
parties
hereto
that
there
is
hereby
created
a
fund
to
be
designated
and
known
as
the
united
mine
workers
of
america
welfare
and
retirement
fund
of
1950,
i'm
at
the
top
of
page
94
(a)
your
honors.
during
the
life
of
this
agreement,
there
shall
be
paid
into
such
fund
by
each
operator
signatory
hereto
the
sum
of
30
cents
per
ton
or
2,000
pounds
on
each
ton
of
coal
produced
for
used
or
sale.
such
fund
shall
have
its
place
of
business
at
washington
and
so
on.
due
to
lack
of
time
we
do
not
care
to
read
further
on
that,
i
want
to
read
on
page
95
(a),
the
second
paragraph.
â€œit
is
agreed
that
this
fund
is
an
irrevocable
trust
created
pursuant
to
section
302
(c)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947.
and
then
there
is
setout
the
very
provisions
that
are
in
the
act
itself.
then
i
want
to
go
over
to
page
96
(a)
the
last
paragraph
and
this
is
exceedingly
vital
to
this
lawsuit.
title
to
all
the
money's
paid
into,
and
or
do
and
owing
said
fund
shall
be
vested
in
and
remain
exclusively
in
the
trustees
of
the
fund
and
it
is
the
intention
of
the
parties
hereto
that
said
funds
shall
constitute
an
irrevocable
trust
and
no
benefits
of
the
moneys
payable
from
this
fund
shall
be
subject
to
anticipation
etcetera.
and
then
the
very
last
sentence
at
the
bottom
of
that
page,
may
it
please
your
honors,
the
moneys
to
be
paid
into
said
fund
shall
not
constitute
or
be
deemed
wages,
due
the
individual
mine
worker.
it
takes
out
the
case
your
honor
recently
had
in
the
embassy
case,
but
it
is
--
these
are
not
wages
in
any
shape
or
form,
shall
not
be
construed
as
wages.
this
is
a
special
fund
created
it
be
true
as
a
result
of
the
labor
or
the
miner,
but
it
never
becomes
his
money,
he
never
has
any
interest
in
it,
the
30
cents
of
ton
incidentally
this
was
accurate,
this
contract
was
amended
to
make
it
40
cents
of
ton
and
during
the
period
we're
interested
in
part
times
30
and
part
40.
but
the
30
cents
per
ton
is
never
belongs
--
after
that
30
cents
of
ton
arises
belongs
to
anybody,
but
the
trustees
and
when
does
it
become
the
property
of
the
trustees?
in
other
words,
when
does
it
become
the
raise
of
the
trust
and
we
go
back
to
what
i
read
from
page,
near
the
bottom
of
96
(a)
titled
to
all
moneys
paid
into
or
due
and
owing
said
fund
shall
vest
in
and
remain
exclusively
in
the
trustees
of
the
fund.
so
that
the
title
to
this
30
cents
a
ton,
although
the
money
remains
in
the
hands
of
the
employer,
is
not
his
money,
it's
nobody's
money
but
ours.
it
may
not
have
been
segregated
but
there's
a
constructive
trust
that
as
soon
as
at
one
ton
of
coal
is
mined
by
our
man,
that
one
30
cents
is
our
money,
that's
not
mined
dollar,
mined
by
the
employer's
men,
but
that
30
cents
is
our
money,
and
although
has
segregated,
he
has
in
his
common
fund,
30
cents
of
ours
in
what,
in
an
irrevocable
trust.
it
can't
be
taken
away
by
wrongful
conduct
of
a
third
party,
not
the
trustees.
that's
the
money
of
the
trustees
and
to
give
the
right
of
set
off.
what
you're
saying
to
us
is
by
wrongful
conduct
of
somebody
else,
the
union,
we're
going
to
take
that
money
away
from
you
though
it's
yours
and
we're
going
to
give
it
to
your
employer.
that's
the
reason,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court,
you
can't
set
it
off.
it's
ours.
it's
made
ours
by
that
trust.
now
the
argument
is
made
and
frequently
been
made,
but
that
can't
be
a
trust
fund,
that
money
is
not
in
existence.
no
the
money
wasn't
in
existence
of
the
time
this
agreement
was
made,
but
there
was
an
intent
expressed
for
these
parties
to
create
that
trust
and
the
raise
comes
into
being
as
the
coal
is
mined.
on
every
ton
this
30
cents
comes
into
being
as
our
money
and
it's
that
type
of
constructive
trust,
this
is
not
an
old
fashioned
garden
variety
trust
that
we
knew
about
in
school
boy
days.
this
is
a
new
form
of
trust
that
is
growing
up
in
recent
years,
but
it
is
a
trust.
now
that
question
your
honor
of
whether
or
not
this
fund
constitutes
a
trust
fund
has
been
before
so
far
as
i
know
only
one
court
where
that
case
of
that
person
has
been
determined.
it
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit,
very
recently
just
in
august
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
attack
was
made
on
it.
the
trustees
brought
an
action
there
against
the
quality
coal
company
seeking
to
recover
this
money
or
to
get
the
possession
of
it,
not
of
recovering
a
debt,
because
that
isn't
a
debt,
seeking
to
get
possession
of
this
money
and
the
defense
was
made
but
it's
nothing
but
a
debt,
it
is
the
trust
fund
and
you
trustees
can't
recover
unless
you
make
enough
money.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
that's
right,
of
the
benedict
coal
company.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
that's
right
and
not
separated.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
constructive
trust.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
yes.
i
think
that's
a
very
good
term.
i've
never
seen
that
term
used,
but
i
think
that
is
a
very
good
term
for
you,
the
chosen
action
trust.
i
think
it
was
a
constructive
trustee.
it
didn't
have
to
be
separated
and
put
away
somewhere
else.
i
agree
to
set
a
piece
of
property
--
to
give
a
piece
of
property
in
trust
to
john
jones,
i
don't
own
it,
i
later
acquire
that
property
but
i
just
don't
acquire
this
much
property,
i
acquire
right
boundary.
the
part
i
agree
to
give
to
john
jones
is
a
constructive
trust
under
it,
other
terms
being
met,
even
though
it
has
yet
to
be
separated
from
the
big
boundary.
i've
acquired
the
ownership
over
the
trust
vested
on
that
portion
i
agree
(inaudible)
to
trust
that.
here,
i
have
doubt
coming
to
possession
of
the
30
cents
a
ton
or
later
the
40
cents
a
ton.
i
have
the
money.
it's
not
mine
because
your
contract
said
with
the
union
and
with
the
trustees
that
the
minute
your
mine
ton
of
a
coal,
there's
30
cents,
the
coal
is
separated
from
its
surrounding
circumstances,
there's
30
cents
of
that,
that's
the
trustees
money.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
well
i'm
inclined
to
think
it
could
be
prosecuted
for
embezzlement.
i
think
that
money
is
so
much
yes.
i
don't
know
if
that
question
has
arisen
but
it's
my
opinion,
yes
your
honor
there
could
be.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
well
--
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
that
is
true
except
--
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
well
a
title
your
honor
--
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
but
it
has
embezzled
our
money.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
well
it
probably
does
before
you
can
get
that.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
what
it's
doing
all
in
all
is
just
as
much
as
if
it's
in
under
that
language
your
honor
as
if
it
were
actually
cashing
our
hands.
we
have
two
different
items
here
in
this
trust.
we
have
the
money
they
paid
us.
we
have
the
other
part
that's
over
here
in
the
bank
account
as
your
honor
said
a
moment
ago
out
of
the
company.
the
only
place
difference
is,
may
it
please
the
court
that
this
trust
fund
is
divided.
part
of
it
we
now
have
in
our
possession,
part
is
over
here
but
we
do
not
need
to
reduce
it
to
possession
under
this
contract
and
under
the
law
of
trust
in
order
to
constitute
a
trust.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
alright,
your
honor,
i'm
going
to
come
that.
i'm
going
to
just
take
that
at
the
moment.
here's
what
happens.
we
go
and
we
mine
100,000
tons
of
coal.
we
get
it
out
of
the
ground
and
under
this
contract,
it's
30
cents
per
ton
to
us.
now
after
we've
mined
the
100,000
of
coal
an
illegal
strike
occurs
if
there
is
such
a
thing
in
this
case,
can
that
take
away
from
us
the
right
that's
already
vested
in
us
for
that
30
cents
a
ton
and
that's
what
the
court
said
below.
it's
out
money
and
the
reason
of
wrongful
conduct
if
there
can
be
such
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
union.
we
say
they
can't
take
away
our
money.
we've
done
all
we
needed
to
do.
we
--
the
union
has
done.
the
man
has
done
nothing
here.
the
man
has
done
all
that
he
needs
to
do.
it's
producing
all
the
coal
there
and
the
moment
they
produce
the
coal,
that
money
is
the
money
of
the
trustees.
now
to
come
along
and
say
about
a
week
later
or
a
month
later
"oh"
that
the
operator
can
defeat
this
by
holding
on
and
on
and
on
and
not
paying
and
eventually
getting
a
strike
planned
weeks,
months,
years
from
now
that
nevertheless
that
you
defeated
our
trust.
that
wasn't
the
intent
of
the
parties.
that's
not
the
law
as
we
see
it.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
that's
right.
there
is
never
any
relationship
of
debtor
and
creditor
between
the
holder
of
this
fund
and
us.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
well
i
heard
just
a
bit
of
that
argument
but
it's
similar
to
the
theory
on
which
i
think
that
some
of
the
court
asked
questions
with
reference
to
that
case,
yes.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
that's
right.
it's
our
money.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
it
is.
they
can't
be
reached
to
take
it
away
from
us.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
no
it
may
--
not
as
far
as
we're
concerned
here.
it
would
have
to
be
that
in
the
ultimate
if
rights
of
third
parties
intervene,
but
there
are
no
third
parties
intervening
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
question
was
asked
the
other
day
by
this
court
with
reference
to
an
attachment
of
tax
lien
and
so
on.
it
would
have
to
be
in
order
to
defeat
that
lien.
but
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
now,
it
really
makes
no
difference.
the
money
is
there
apparently,
and
we
have
the
right
to
that
money,
and
they
have
no
right
to
setoff
the
claim
to
pay
the
debt
of
somebody
else.
what
they're
doing
is
taking
our
money.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
oh
no.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
it
is
segregated
by
this
contract,
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
well
i
don't
want
to
quite
get
in
that
position,
may
it
please
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
they
might,
the
coal
might
not
yet
have
been
sold
and
turned
into
cash.
the
coal
may
still
be
(inaudible)
on
the
yard
but
it's
either
got
to
be
in
cash
or
in
the
coal.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
that's
right,
i
follow
you.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
no
sir
i'm
suing
for
money
(voice
overlap).
i'm
suing
this
people
because
they
are
withholding
my
money.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
not
as
a
debtor.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
they
hold
my
money.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
i
can't
refer
to
it.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
i
guess
that's
correct,
your
honor,
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
follow
that
but
--
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
yes
it's
our
property.
it
might
be
(voice
overlap)
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
yes,
your
honor.
i
want
to
call
attention
to
just
two
of
these
things
(inaudible)
because
i
do
not
take
the
time
of
my
co-counsel
in
here.
on
this
question,
i
want
to
call
the
attention
of
this
court
to
the
fact
that
in
1947
just
after
labor
and
management
relations
act
was
enacted,
the
united
mine
workers
of
america
and
the
operators
set
up
a
trust
similar
to
this,
but
in
that
trust
they
provided
that
the
trust
fund
covered
only
the
money
in
the
fund.
we
ask
that
you
are
to
impress
your
honor
as
to
file
ago,
but
a
case
came
along
in
the
district
court
in
arkansas
and
incidentally
i
find
my
reason
there
in
my
brief
that
i
would
like
to
ask
this
court
to
correct
on
the
printed
brief
and
so
would
please.
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
11,
in
the
footnote,
the
date
of
that
arkansas
case
johnson
--
jackson
--
lewis
against
jackson
&
squire
is
marked
1954,
your
honors
it
should
be
1949.
we
got
the
error
that
is
put
it
there.
the
jackson-squires
case
held
that
an
action
could
not
be
maintained
by
the
trustees
for
this
amount
of
money
owing
because
the
trust
had
not
arisen.
then
we
came
along
and
rewrote
the
trust
immediately
following
that
to
answer
the
very
question
that
his
honor
asked
a
while
ago
that
--
then
we
added
in
to
it
the
words
entitled
the
money
paid
into,
that's
as
far
as
the
old
contract
went,
what
the
newman
said
and
due
or
due
and
owing
said
fund
shall
be
vested
in
these
trustees.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
so
far
as
the
present
case
is
concerned
that's
true
and
that
can
be
as
far
as
it
needs
to
go,
but
you
might
have
right
to
third
parties
intervening
in
there
because
it's
a
debt,
your
honor.
we
think
that
no
rights
of
third
parties
could
ever
intervene
here
so
as
to
take
it
away
from
us.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
the
title
to
it
does
rest
in
them
i
agree
on
that.
but
first,
it
can
be
a
trustee
of
funds
in
their
possession
under
many
conditions
that
we
recite
in
our
brief
that
i
haven't
time
to
go
into.
that's
true
that
an
ordinary
employer
cannot
be
a
trustee
of
wages
but
this
is
not
wages.
therefore,
it
could
be.
there's
one
other
thing
that
i
want
to
talk
just
very,
very
briefly
about
and
i
want
to
mention
the
fact
that
this
is
an
irrevocable
trust.
if
you're
going
to
--
if
we
are
going
to,
i
should
say,
permit
a
setoff,
it's
not
irrevocable.
what
happens?
the
right
to
this
money
is
revoked
the
minute
there
is
a
breach
of
the
trust
if
they
can
recover
damages
into
that
say
of
this
sort
which
i
don't
think
we
can
but
if
they
can,
it
is
revoked
by
the
conduct
of
the
third
party,
the
union
here.
now
one
other
thing,
this
trust
is
set
up
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
labor
and
management
relations
act
of
1947.
and
that
act
provides
in
these
words
that
judgments
may
be
obtained
against
the
union
for
this
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
certain
other
things,
but
such
judgment
shall
be
satisfied
only
out
of
the
assets
of
the
union.
when
you
permit
a
setoff
here,
you
are
taking
our
assets
to
pay
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
employer,
contrary
to
the
spirit
under
--
of
the
very
act
that
authorizes
a
creation
of
this
trust.
the
act
says
you
cannot
pay
these
judgments.
that's
what
this
is.
you
cannot
pay
this
$81,000
out
of
anything
but
assets
of
the
union.
this
$76,000
is
our
asset
and
you're
violating
the
very
spirit.
in
fact
the
word
itself
as
well
as
the
spirit
of
the
statute
which
permits
the
creation
of
this
trust
when
setoff
is
permitted.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
in
certain
conditions,
he
does,
in
certain
conditions,
he
does
not.
in
order
to
be
a
beneficiary
of
the
trust
under
the
terms
and
conditions
set
out
in
writing
it
through
regard
by
the
act,
he
can
be
a
--
not
a
miner
for
a
period
of
time
and
still
be
a
beneficiary,
his
family
can
be
beneficiaries.
there
will
come
a
time
when
he
will
have
a
cutoff
date
after
a
given
period
of
time.
but
your
honors
this
trust
fund
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
beneficiaries
that
is
what
they
get
from
us
i
mean
what
we
got
from
benedict
is
not
for
the
employees
of
benedict
and
their
families
and
their
children,
but
they
will
use
into
a
common
fund
not
separated
as
to
each
employer
but
goes
into
a
common
fund
in
which
the
employees,
the
wives
and
their
dependents
get
insurance,
hospital
benefits
and
many
other
things
from
all
employers.
there
is
no
separation
as
to
one
employer,
money
collected
from
one
employer
being
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees
of
that
employer
alone.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
well
it
relates
to
him
in
the
sense
that
it
only
arises
on
coal
produced
by
its
employees
--
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
--
but
the
beneficiaries
are
the
indefinite
type
of
beneficiaries
in
this
charitable
trust.
now
there
are
people
here
who
caused
the
strike
that
undoubtedly
may
never
become
beneficiaries.
because
of
their
wrongful
conduct,
we
deprive
beneficiaries
may
divide
beneficiaries
with
his
children
anybody
else
1000
miles
away
from
the
benefits
of
this
trust.
we
say
with
all
earnest,
may
it
please
the
court
that
in
the
spirit
of
the
law,
the
attitude
of
the
courts,
during
the
last
15
or
20
years
has
been
to
encourage
this
trusts
and
help
build
it.
if
the
old
technical
sense
of
construction
is
to
be
applied
to
this
trust
and
we
say
that
we
have
to
appear
as
third
party
beneficiaries
and
as
such
as
anybody
can
violate
this
agreement
and
deprive
us
of
our
rights
under
beneficial
rights,
we're
going
back
simply
the
old
common
law
variety
of
trust.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
that's
true
and
that's
true
your
honor.
personally,
i
tend
to
argue
but
i
haven't
done
although
there
is
a
provision
in
this
agreement
that
the
entire
agreement
should
be
considered
as
an
integrated
agreement
but
that
general
provision
not
to
be
argued
your
honor
by
our
opposition
does
not
override
the
specific
provisions
set
forth
in
our
brief
that
the
specific
provision
for
the
creation
of
this
trust
--
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
that's
exactly
what
we
say
and
because
this
specific
provision
must
override
any
general
statements
outside
somewhere
else
in
need
of
it.
mr.
russell
r.
kramer
well
you
do
and
when
reading
its
entirety,
your
only
way
has
the
idea
here
that
this
is
a
separate
part
of
the
agreement
and
we
are
entitled
to
this
money
as
a
trust
fund.
thank
you.
