justice

frankfurter
suppose
you
had
breach
of
agreement
in
this
case,
suppose
this
case
had
been
settled
out
of
the
court,
the
larger
question
if
you
let
them
break
it,
justice
harlan
would
still
may.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
we
nevertheless
go
ahead
and
decide
it
although
the
parties
came
in
and
stipulated
that
they
have
settled
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
question
because
a
larger
question
remains?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
justice
harlan
is
suggesting
there
is
no
controversy,
there's
no
set-off.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
say,
i
take
it,
that
this
court
reaches
your
question
first,
the
other
question
is
still
undecided
and
that
isn't
be
moot
at
that
point,
well
they
go
on
it
like
the
government
â€“
it
wouldn't
become
moot
if
your
point
of
view
recollected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
does
that,
does
the
fact
that
we
sue
formally
as
trustees
and
entirely
eliminated
(inaudible)
giving
rise
to
a
setoff
because
the
trustees
derive
that
from
their
right
as
third
party
beneficiaries.
in
other
words,
the
legal
relations
of
the
parties,
i
should
think,
(inaudible)
legal
relationship
with
the
parties.
i'm
just
thinking
well
of
it
no
matter
what
label
you
give
yourself
as
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
the
fact
that
you
derive
your
(inaudible)
in
the
third
party
beneficiaries
is
irrelevant
to
the
suit
by
the
trustee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
dual
capacity
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
you
derive
your
funds
through
the
contract
which
you
say
also
(inaudible)
third
party
beneficiary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
believing
that
the
provision
of
the
labor
management
act
does
not
bear
upon
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
fiscal,
the
inter-physical
relationship
is
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
get
no
light
or
shadow
from
the
taft-hartley
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
own
time
--
in
your
own
good
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
this
--
you
mean
this
x
times
30
cents
worth
money
in
the
bank
account
of
the
respondent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
generalized
bank
account.
justice
felix
frankfurter
benedict
coal
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
there
was
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
chosen
action
of
trust.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
have
to
use
--
it
would
have
to
use
so
much
as
not
to
leave
an
aliquot
share
which
would
amount
for
x
times
30.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
on
majority
hypothesis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
after
that
term,
it
said
even
title
if
we
can
talk
about
title
it
didn't
matter,
it
belongs
to
the
benedict
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
--
if
it
uses
all
the
money
and
so
is
it
--
needs
not
a
nickel
in
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
has
to
get
down
to
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
are
you
suing
for
then?
you're
not
suing
for
a
debt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
really
a
tort
by
way
of
breach
of
a
tort
by
way
of
interfering
with
your
trust
of
this
case,
they
don't
owe
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
don't
care
about
labors
but
your
argument
so
strongly
insist
they
don't
owe
you
anything
in
the
sense
of
a
debtor
and
creditor
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
what
you
are
seeking
to
get
is
the
money
worth
of
their
interference
with
your
property,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
automatically,
it
becomes
your
trust
just
as
soon
as
the
coal
is
segregated
and
the
30
cents
worth
is
reckoned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
benedict's
obligation
relates
to
benedict's
employees,
does
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
your
--
what
your
argument
there
rests
upon
the
contention
that
the
provision
of
the
collective
agreement
dealing
with
all
sorts
of
aspects
of
the
complicated
relationship
between
a
coal
operator
and
his
men
is
that
the
trust,
the
creation
of
the
trust
is
to
be
severed
from
the
generalized
collective
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
questionable
overriding,
it's
how
you
read
a
specific
provision
that's
part
of
a
general
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
a
must?
i
thought
we've
only
brought
up
if
you
read
a
document
in
its
entirety.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
you
regard
the
meat
case
of
the
first
circuit
as
opposed
to
your
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
distinguishing
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
respectfully
lost
three
isn't
coextensive
and
that
doesn't
suck
all
the
meaning
out
of
the
elimination
of
the
no-strike
clause
as
a
mere
matter
of
reading,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
referred
or
disagreed
with
the
district
of
columbia
decision,
and
therefore
we're
not
unaware
of
the
arguments
that
you're
making.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
leaving
in
there
after
some
conflicts
have
inevitably
arrived
in
these
and
for
some
conflict,
specific
mode
of
settling
there,
is
that
right,
is
that
a
bare
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
specific
mode
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
all
disputes,
but
certain
ones.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
what
any
or
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
any
and
all,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose,
the
note
was
given
(inaudible)
suppose
this
note,
this
hypothetical
note
was
given
in
settlement
of
a
prior
claim
for
illegal
stoppages
in
violation
of
the
interdependent
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
yes,
yes
means
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
--
were
money
is
owing
in
the
trust
fund
that
exceeded
the
setoff
of
the
complaints?
is
the
said
officer
saw
all
the
trust
fund
obligations
that
were
otherwise
used
that
would
--
that
would
otherwise
the
committee
pay?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
cut
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
period
for
which
suit
was
--
was
the
period
for
which
setoff
was
claimed
been
granted
by
the
district
court?
(inaudible)
what
would
have
been
produced,
the
payment
that
would
have
been
used
over
the
period
in
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
finished
with
the
--
with
the
first
--
problem
with
the
first
case,
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
real
question,
isn't
it,
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
is
the
real
question
whether
a
breach
of
contract
not
whether
specifically
there
is
an
agreement
not
to
strike.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
suggestion
may
--
may
not
come
out
or
stay
away,
but
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
how
you
put
a
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
make
of
the
argument
of
judge
madden
that
it's
hard
to
believe
that
they
deleted
in
section
1
of
the
agreement
what
they
restored
in
section
3,
as
they
deleted
the
no-strike
and
then
have
it
come
back
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
12
lines
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
cognizable
under
the
specific
machinery
would
be
all
but
national
strike,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
would
be
others.
what
are
those?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
implication
of
that,
that
would
be
by
implication,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
this
exception
or
this
qualification
was
an
implied
qualification,
is
it
not?
the
local
versus
national
is
explicit.
the
memorial,
do
i
find
that
in
terms
that
is
used?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
wonder
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
i
wonder
where
these
other
types
come
from.
do
they
come
by
virtue
of
the
business
practice
of
the
industry
which
impliedly
is
ready
to
the
contract,
because
section
3
doesn't
speak
of
it,
doesn't
it?
where
did
you
get
that
from
when
you
gave
me
the
--
gave
the
answer
to
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
it's
the
practice
of
the
industry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
accept
--
do
you
accept
judge
madden's
account
of
the
history
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
winston,
judge
madden
would
say
to
that,
i
think,
in
light
of
what
he
does
--
the
section
3,
the
gentlemen's
agreement
and
as
gentlemen
they're
not
(inaudible)
for
us,
but
it
has
no
legal
significance,
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
of
them
is

justice
