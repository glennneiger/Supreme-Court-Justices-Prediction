mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
stated
by
mr.
kramer,
there
are
two
questions
before
the
court.
the
first
question
involves
the
controversy
between
the
trustees
and
benedict
and
the
second
question
involves
the
controversy
between
benedict
and
the
union.
as
noted,
if
we
are
in
error
on
the
second
question,
we
are
wrong,
then
the
first
question
would
become
moot.
but
we
think
our
position
is
sound
in
this
case
so
we
don't
think
that
the
first
question
will
become
moot.
but
in
neither
event,
i
agree
with
mr.
kramer
that
it
is
a
question
of
importance
and
that
this
court
should
determine
it.
the
first
question
involves
the
trustees'
claim
against
benedict
for
royalties
that
the
trustees
claim
are
due
and
owing
and
for
royalties
which
the
trustees
claim
they
had
a
vested
right
to.
before
discussing
that,
we
come
back
to
the
initial
contract,
that
is
the
contract
of
1950
between
benedict
and
other
operators
and
the
union,
the
national
coal
contract.
this
contract
is
an
integrated
contract.
its
provisions
are
interdependent.
a
portion
of
the
contract
provides
for
this
trust
fund.
this
contract
in
that
portion
also
sets
out
benedict's
obligations
of
payment
to
the
trustees
and
sets
out
the
method
of
computation
when
the
obligation
accrues
and
so
forth.
this
contract
also
contains
the
settlement
of
local
dispute
section,
which
the
court
has
considered
in
the
first
argument
and
it
is
a
section
that
sets
out
the
various
steps
for
the
settling
of
these
local
disputes
and
troubles.
the
key
part
of
this
first
contract,
for
our
consideration,
is
section
3
of
the
miscellaneous
clause,
which
is
already
been
pointed
out
to
the
court.
the
pertinent
part
of
--
of
this
clause,
rather
this
clause
itself
reads
as
follows,
section
3,
“the
contracting
parties
agree
that,
as
a
part
of
the
consideration
of
this
contract,
any
and
all
disputes,
stoppages,
suspensions
of
work
and
any
and
all
claims,
demands
or
actions
growing
therefrom
or
involved
therein,
shall,
by
the
contracting
parties,
be
settled
and
determined
exclusively
by
the
machinery
provided
in
the
settlement
of
"local
and
district
disputes
section
of
this
agreement,
or,
if
national
in
character,
by
the
full
use
of
free
collective
bargaining
as
heretofore
known
and
practiced
in
industry.”
this
contract
also
hung
as
a
clause
which
we
think
is
the
key
to
the
whole
issue
and
that
is
the
interdependent
clause.
it
reads
as
follows,
“this
agreement
is
an
integrated
instrument
and
its
respective
provisions
are
interdependent
and
shall
be
effective
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i
was
reading
from
page
2
of
my
brief,
sir,
in
the
record.
it
would
be
page
107a,
page
2
of
my
brief,
page
107a
of
the
record.
now,
our
position
in
this
case
is
simple.
well,
it
is
that
the
trust
is
the
creature
of
this
contract.
the
trustees'
rights
are
derivative
from
this
contract.
whatever
you
may
call
the
trustees
or
whatever
position
they
may
claim
that
they
are
occupying
in
this
lawsuit,
they
are
still
in
the
position
of
beneficiaries
of
this
contract
when
we
consider
their
rights.
since
they
are
the
beneficiaries
of
this
contract,
they
would
then
be
subject
to
the
same
defenses
and
in
regards
to
their
claims
for
royalties
that
benedict
might
assert
against
the
other
contracting
party,
the
union.
this
defense
would
include
offset
or
failure
of
consideration
or
non-performance
which
we
are
concerned
with
here.
now,
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
union
breached
the
very
provision,
that
is
section
3
of
the
miscellaneous
clause,
that
was
stated
to
be
a
part
of
the
consideration
of
the
contract.
now,
the
trustees,
on
the
other
hand,
insist
that
they
are
merely
trustees
seeking
to
recall
a
trust
property,
title
to
which
has
vested
in
them.
and
that
brings
up
the
other
key
question
and
that
is
has
title
to
this
money
sought
vested
so
as
to
preclude
the
defenses
that
benedict
might
assert
against
the
union.
we
state
that
as
to
this
$76,000,
title
has
not
vested.
our
reasons
are
these.
in
the
first
place,
the
money
before
title
can
vest
in
--
in
the
trustees
must
be
due
and
owing.
now,
to
be
due
and
owing,
the
union,
at
the
time
that
it
is
alleged
to
be
due
and
owing,
what
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
production
of
the
coal
upon
which
the
amount
is
computed,
must
be
in
performance
of
its
interdependent
obligations
to
bid
in
this
case,
the
union
was
not.
in
the
first
strike
activity
that
was
a
violation
of
the
contract
started
in
the
early
part
of
april
1950.
to
be
due
and
owing,
the
amount
computed
from
the
production
of
coal
must
also
be
free
from
claims
or
rights
of
settle.
in
this
case,
it
was
not.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
no,
sir,
that's
my
argument,
sir.
the
contract
[laughs]
merely
says,
title
vest
in
money
in
two
situations
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
--
that
is
money
paid,
one,
which
is
not
in
issue
at
this
time,
and
two,
money
due
and
owing.
therefore,
our
position
is
the
key
is
whether
at
the
time
the
money
is
due
and
owing.
we
say
at
the
time
it
is
not
due
and
owing
or
the
right
of
the
trustees
to
assert
that
it
is
due
and
owing
is
limited
because
at
that
time,
the
union
was
not
in
compliance
with
an
interdependent
obligation.
that
is
our
position,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
no,
sir,
because
benedict
would
owe
the
union
$100,000
and
owe
the
trustees
$100,000.
no,
sir,
that
would
not.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i
understood
you
say
that
the
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
i
had
my
parties
backwards.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
no,
sir,
for
this
reason.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
because
that
note
doesn't
come
under
the
terms
of
this
contract.
that
would
be
a
separate
contract
between
the
union
and
benedict.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
a
good
question,
sir.
i
would
say
yes,
[laughter]
yes.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes
means
it
could
be
offset
because
if
the
note
had
been
given
because
--
because
the
union
had
violated
another
provision
of
the
contract,
then
we're
getting
back
to
the
contract.
it
will
be
a
little
different
as
to
whether
a
note
was
given
or
whether
a
court
determines
that
an
amount
is
due.
we
get
back
to
the
same
result.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
it
would
not
be
a
material
claim
until
three
years.
i'd
say
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
it
--
yes,
sir,
if
presently
due
and
owing,
yes,
sir.
i
think
--
so
that
wouldn't
be
a
practical
--
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i
say
they
owe
that
to
the
trustees
if
at
the
time
of
the
production
of
coal,
the
union
is
in
compliance
with
its
obligations
under
the
contract,
which
obligations
were
given
as
a
part
of
the
consideration
for
benedict's
promise
to
pay
to
the
trustees.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
that,
mr.
justice
black,
is
rather
stressing
things.
i
did
not
argue
that,
no,
sir.
it
may
affect
the
satisfaction
of
the
claim.
but
it
would
not
in
the
end
enforcement
of
the
claim.
now,
the
way
we
have
it
here,
the
district
court
said
that
the
union
must
pay
the
damage
into
court
and
this
damage
money
will
first
be
used
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
the
trustees.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i
think
it
is,
sir.
i'm
sure
it
is.
there's
been
no
intimation
that
the
united
mine
workers
doesn't
have
the
money.
i'm
sure
they
do.
so
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
the
--
the
judgment
which
we
recovered
against
the
union
is
used
as
an
offset,
it's
used
to
pay
the
claim.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
trustees.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
under
the
way
it
was
handled
by
the
district
court,
the
application
of
funds.
that's
the
way
the
offset
was
--
was
handled
procedural
matter,
sir.
now,
sir,
getting
back
to
our
position
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
there
is
an
exhibit,
your
honor,
that
indicates
it.
benedict
started
getting
behind
in
october
1950.
there's
also
an
exhibit
file
by
mr.
ryan
which
shows
the
production
and
showed
payments.
i
have
reason
to
look
at
the
first
exhibit
which
would
indicate
it.
you,
gentlemen,
have
the
mr.
ryan's
exhibit,
i
have
not
recently
looked
at
that,
sir.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
mr.
ryan's
exhibit
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
--
the
exact
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
would
be
different.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
for
this
reason.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
well,
with
this
qualification,
if
the
union
had
been
in
compliance
at
the
time
the
$76,000
accrued.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
this
was
a
continuing
account
and
of
necessity
it
began
in
march
of
1950,
because
that's
when
the
contract
started,
and
it
continued
up
until
july
of
1953.
the
strikes
were
also
a
continuing
pattern
of
activity.
the
first
damaging
strike
occurred
in
april.
i
think
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
--
i
am
safe
to
say
that
the
first
of
the
damaging
strikes
occurred
prior
to
the
time
that
any
of
this
account
accrued.
mr.
ryan's
exhibit
would
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong.
i
think
i
am
safe
in
saying
that.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i
do
not
take
that
position,
sir,
for
this
reason.
the
money
would
be
due
and
owing
if,
at
that
time,
the
union
was
in
compliance
and
if,
at
that
time,
there
was
no
claim
to
offset.
and
therefore,
title
would
vest
at
that
time.
my
position
is
that
at
the
time
the
production
of
these
coal
occurred,
the
union
was
not
in
compliance
and
there
were
rights
to
offset
and
therefore,
the
money
was
not
due
and
owing
and
there
was
not
any
vesting
of
trustees'
rights
at
the
time
of
computation
of
production
of
coal.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
your
honor,
to
be
fair,
that
matter
was
not
gone
into
at
the
lower
courts.
in
preparing
for
trial
in
this
court,
i
thought
of
that
point
and
i
checked
what
record
i
had,
and
the
record
that
i
had
indicates
the
first
strike
activity
occurred
prior
to
the
time
that
this
particular
money
or
the
right
to
this
particular
that
the
coal
produced
coming
this
particular
money
was
produced.
mr.
ryan's
exhibit
would
be
precise
on
this.
if
i'm
wrong
that
may
limit
a
little
bit,
if
i'm
wrong
on
my
facts.
now,
sir
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
coming
back
to
that
point,
sir,
the
trustees
claim
that
the
sole
condition
precedent
or
condition
to
the
creation
of
the
trust
(inaudible)
was
the
computation
of
the
production
of
coal
or
was
the
production
of
coal.
i
say
that
was
error.
to
adopt
that,
you
disregard
the
other
parts
of
the
contract,
and
we
must
consider
the
whole
contract.
we
state
that
other
conditions
to
the
creation
of
the
trust
ray
of
first
union
performance
at
or
prior
to
the
time
of
the
production
of
coal
and
second,
that
this
money
be
free
from
claims
of
offset.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
--
it
says
the
obligation
shall
commence
at
the
date
of
the
signing
of
the
contract,
payment
shall
be
made
on
the
10th
day
of
each
month
and
each
succeeding
days,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
respect
--
that
is
the
provision
of
the
contract
in
all
that,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
your
honor,
in
the
beginning
i
don't
think
they
were
looking
towards
the
eventual
setoff.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
your
honor,
they
made
some
payments
in
1953.
i
believe
the
exhibit
will
show
probably
in
june,
if
i
remember
it
right,
the
suit
for
1954.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
1956.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
that's
right.
the
truth
of
the
matter,
there's
no
money
to
pay
it,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i
say
that
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
there
was
no
money
to
pay
it.
the
operating
statement
show
that
benedict
was
going
busted
during
--
was
going
insolvent
during
this
period.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
what's
that,
sir?
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
operating
statement
show
that
some
months
benedict
was
making
money
and
some
months
they
were
not.
i
could
go
out
set
of
the
record
and
give
you
a
more
complete
picture
of
that
but
i'll
try
to
stick
to
what
the
record
shows.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
at
the
district
court
it
did,
sir.
however,
the
circuit
court,
we
bought
for
force
action
on
some
11
strikes.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
they
cut
us
down
to
eight
strikes
and
cut
us
off
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
let
me
consult
the
record,
sir.
it
was
a
considerable
amount.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
complaint
was,
as
i
recall,
close
to
correct
on
tonnage.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
between
march
the
5th,
1950
and
september
30,
1952,
production
459,000
plus,
between
october
1st
1952
and
july
31st
1953,
production
was
103,000
plus.
page
151
of
the
record
also
shows
the
stipulation
that
indicates
that,
sir.
150a
or
151a,
that
shows
the
stipulation
of
the
man
of
the
coal
mine
doing
the
first
period,
march
5th
1950
to
september
30th
1952
was
467,000
tons
plus
and
the
second
period
was
94,000
tons
plus,
that
is
october
1st,
1952
through
july
1953.
getting
back
to
the
points
and
issues,
the
trustees
also
claim
that
the
effect
of
this
offset
is
to
revoke
a
vested
trust.
we
state
that
it
is
not
because
unpaid
royalties
have
not
vested,
if
not
due
and
owing,
because
of
failure
of
consideration,
non-performance
or
right
of
settle.
we
also
state
that
the
trustees'
interpretation
of
the
term
“interdependent”
is
rather
strange.
they
insist
in
their
briefs
that
term
means
that
all
operators
sign
similar
contracts,
and
that
this
is
an
entire
contract
for
all
operators.
we
think
that
term
is
the
key
to
the
case
and
merely
means
that
all
of
the
terms
and
all
of
the
obligations
are
interdependent
and
the
obligation,
of
course,
of
benedict
to
have
money
due
and
owing
the
trustees
is
dependent
upon
the
union
being
in
compliance.
the
--
nor
do
i
see
this
as
a
matter
of
shifting
responsibility
for
union
acts
to
the
trustees.
the
trustees
are
not
responsible
for
union
acts.
however,
the
trustees'
rights
to
this
money
is
limited
by
whether
or
not
the
union
complies
with
its
promises
under
the
contract.
simply,
our
position
is
the
trustee
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
contract
and
his
claim
that
he
has
a
vested
interest.
he
is
subject
to
defenses
that
benedict
may
have
against
the
union.
i
think
mr.
frankfurter
in
his
question
to
mr.
kramer
very
directly
asked
to
both
key
to
the
case
although
this
portion
of
the
case
when
mr.
frankfurter
asked
is
the
creation
of
the
trust
to
be
severed
from
the
rest
of
the
contract.
the
trustees'
position
in
this
case
is
that
it
is
to
be
severed
from
the
rest
of
the
contract.
our
position
is
most
emphatically
that
the
creation
of
the
trust
is
not
to
be
severed
--
severed
from
the
rest
of
the
contract
for
the
very
reason
that
the
contract
itself
says
that
it
is
an
integrated
instrument,
its
provisions
are
interdependent
and
miscellaneous
clause
3
specifically
says,
that
as
a
part
of
the
consideration
of
the
contract
or
stoppages
and
so
forth
will
be
settled
by
the
contract
machinery.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
stoppages
or
strike,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
what's
the
question?
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
sir,
i
think
the
contract
contemplated
that
there
might
be
stoppages
but
it
did
not
omit
stoppages.
the
fact
that
the
contract
contemplates
stoppages
doesn't
mean
that
it
intends
stoppages
to
be
within
the
contract.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
you
can
contemplate
breaches,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
stoppages
and
other
disputes.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
the
--
the
four
section
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
it
realizes
that
the
union
might
break
this
contract
and
have
stoppages.
yes.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
they
end
it.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir,
they
would.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i
get
that
idea
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
mr.
justice,
my
position
is
that
the
contract
may
contemplate
that
there
will
be
stoppages,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
say
that
stoppages
are
permitted
under
the
contract.
you
can
contemplate
that
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
your
honor,
my
answer
to
that
is
this,
the
effect
of
the
cancellation
clause
first
is
to
put
the
parties
in
the
same
position
as
though
they
had
been
no
cancellation
clause
and
second
it
restores
the
right
to
strike
as
to
matters
that
are
not
cognizable
under
the
dispute
section.
the
key
matter
is
this,
sir.
i
do
not
say
that
a
mere
strike
is
a
breach
of
the
contract.
that
is
not
my
position.
the
key
is
the
purpose
of
the
strike.
i
do
say
that
a
strike
for
the
purpose
of
settling
a
dispute
is
a
breach
of
this
contract.
it
is
a
breach
of
section
3
of
the
miscellaneous
clause
which
says
that
all
disputes,
stoppages,
suspensions,
claims,
demands
will
be
settled
and
determined
exclusively
by
the
machinery
provided
from
the
settlement
of
local
and
district
dispute
section.
i
see
the
reason
for
your
honest
question.
i
say
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
strike
for
a
dispute
settling
purpose
and
a
strike
which
has
its
--
has
its
purpose
something
else
or
the
strikes
which
are
for
dispute
settling
purposes.
of
course,
at
this
time,
we
--
we
are
getting
on
to
the
--
the
second
question
that
we
have,
sir.
and
i'll
continue
in
this
line.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i'll
continue
on
this
line,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes.
mr.
justice
black,
we
have
eight
strikes,
the
facts
in
those
eight
strikes
are
somewhat
different.
in
some
of
them,
the
strike
occurred
before
there
was
anything
taken
up
with
management.
in
others,
the
matters
in
dispute
were
taken
up
with
management
or
were
discussed
with
management
prior
to
the
actual
strike.
but
in
all
of
them,
it
was
obvious
that
the
strike
was
called
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
union
to
get
what
they
wanted.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
there
was
a
refusal
to
arbitrate
on
the
part
of
the
union
agents.
there
was
not
a
refusal
to
go
to
through
the
initial
processes.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i'd
state
that
that
would
be
the
fourth
or
the
fifth
step
in
the
procedure.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i
think
the
term
was
used
to
arbitrate.
i
think
that
held
as
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
steps,
sir.
as
to
the
first,
second
and
third
steps,
as
i
state
the
facts
are
little
different
in
each
one
but
generally,
if
--
steps
were
taken
under
the
first,
second
and
third
steps.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
it
boils
down
--
various
complaints
were
made,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir,
in
the
cross-complaint.
it
boils
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
had
breached
the
contract
because
they
used
strike
methods
for
settling
claims
instead
of
contractual
methods.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
not
--
not
in
those
steps.
we
alleged
that
they
refuse
to
arbitrate
and
to
follow
the
contractual
provisions.
the
evidence
shows
that
in
most
of
the
strikes
anyhow
the
first,
the
second,
probably
the
third
steps
we're
going
into.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i'll
see
your
question,
yes,
sir,
it's
a
good
point.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
--
that
also
was
part
of
the
charge.
i
mean
part
of
the
complaint.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i
think
the
judgment
is
based
on
the
fact
that
they
used
strikes
to
settle
the
disputes
in
derogation
of
section
3.
i
think
that's
the
gist
of
the
judgment.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
this
type
of
cases,
you
have
a
multitude
of
charges
and
allegations.
when
you
get
down
to
it,
i
think
the
basic
issue
is
was
the
use
of
strike
--
of
a
strike
for
dispute-settling
purposes
for
violation
of
section
3,
to
me,
that's
the
gist
of
this
case,
the
key
to
this
case.
as
i
stated,
we
state
that
the
use
of
strikes
for
dispute
settling
purposes
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i've
finished
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
if
the
court
had
any
question,
sir
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
--
i'd
be
glad
to
answer
them.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i
wound
up
that
part,
sir,
when
i
--
i
cited
the
question
that
you
made
about
the
severability,
our
position
on
mr.
kramer's
position.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
they
argue
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i
do
not
follow
them.
that
point
is
moot
in
this
case
because
at
this
point,
at
least,
because
the
union
is
to
pay
into
the
court
the
amount
that
benedict
might
recover
from
the
union
and
that
money
in
turn,
will
be
paid
to
the
trustees
in
this
case
that
is
a
moot
point.
but
if
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
and
i
have
proven
my
answer.
that's
also
based
upon
the
premise
that
you
have
satisfaction
by
withholding
trustee
payments.
that's
based
on
a
further
premise
that
the
man
that
you
--
the
third
point
is
that
you
have
the
judgment
against,
isn't
solved.
now,
there's
no
intimation
of
that
in
this
record.
i
don't
think
it's
solved.
furthermore,
section
301
(b)
doesn't
use
the
word,
“satisfaction”.
they
used
the
word,
“enforce”
or
“enforceability”.
now,
there
is
a
difference
between
enforcing
a
judgment
and
satisfying
a
judgment.
enforcing
is
a
positive
action
to
go
--
collect
money
from
somebody.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir,
we
did.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
as
to
this
case
that's
a
moot
point.
it's
my
point,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
would
make
a
difference
because
then
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
you
would
be.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
for
the
purposes
of
argument,
it
would
make
a
difference,
but
i
still
say
you
would
be,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
to
the
extent
of
--
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
it
would
because
getting
back
--
the
reason
for
it
is
we
get
back
to
the
initial
contract
that
the
trustees
had
the
position
of
third
party
beneficiaries.
and
therefore,
their
right
to
claim
that
is
due
and
owing
is
subject
to
any
defenses
including
offset
which
benedict
may
have
against
the
union.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
there
were
no
further
questions
as
to
the
trustees,
then,
sir,
i'll
proceed
as
to
the
other
case,
the
other
issue
as
to
whether
or
not,
there's
been
a
breach
of
contract.
our
interpretation
of
this
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes.
as
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
--
as
the
real
question
of
this
case,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
has
no
specific
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
as
the
real
question
in
this
case,
we
state
that
a
--
use
of
strikes
for
dispute-settling
purposes
is
a
breach
of
section
3
of
the
miscellaneous
clause.
now,
as
to
--
to
our
--
noted
an
argument
by
mr.
boiarsky,
when
he
said
that
strikes
don't
settle
disputes.and
i
take
issue
with
that
argument.
i
say,
in
this
case
at
bar
strikes
did
settle
disputes,
that
the
evidence
was
that
the
men
would
strike
and
the
company
would
cave
in.
and
in
at
least
part
of
the
strikes,
the
company
got
their
way
as
evidence
in
this
case
that
our
committeeman
was
advised
by
a
representative
that
he
couldn't
tell
him
to
go
--
to
strike,
“but
if
you
don't
get
what
you
want,
you
know
what
to
do,”
and
the
strikes
were
suggested
as
a
method
of
which
the
committee
could
get
what
they
wanted,
and
that's
this
case.
that
fits
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
that's
why
i
say
in
this
case
strikes
were
used
for
dispute-settling
purposes.
now,
the
question
is
that
a
breach
of
the
contract.
a
correct
interpretation
of
it
would
indicate
that
it
is.
we're
going
to
basic
matters.
we
first
look
to
the
purpose
of
an
intent
of
the
contract
and
the
conditions
around
1950.
the
contract
itself
says
that
its
purpose
is
to
promote
and
improve
the
industrial
and
economic
relationship
in
the
coal
industry.
now,
to
settle
local
matters
and
disputes
by
grievance
machinery
is
a
promotion
of
the
economic
relationship.
but
to
use
strikes
to
settle
these
little
disputes
would
certain
not
be
a
promotion
of
the
economic
relationship.
we
must
also
bear
in
mind
that
the
parties
to
this
contract,
the
people
that
had
it
--
the
leaders
of
this
union.
they
are
enlightened
and
progressive
labor
leaders.
now,
the
leaders
of
the
coal
industry
at
that
time
were
enlightened
and
progressive
leaders,
they
had
to
be.
they
were
looking
for
a
progressive
method
of
settling
disputes.
and
therefore,
when
they
wrote
clause
3,
they
meant
to
the
operators
to
have
a
continuity
of
production
so
that
they
can
meet
the
other
competitive
views
to
give
the
--
calls
the
construction
that
the
union
contends
for
or
would
not
be
a
promotion,
it
would
be
a
step
backward.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
as
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
i
don't
think
he
completely
covered
it,
sir.
in
the
second
--
in
the
first
place,
they
did
not
completely
restore
in
section
3
what
they
deleted.
they
just
wiped
out
all
previous
clauses
and
section
3
was
substituted
therefore,
and
section
3
would
restrict
strike
activity
only
as
to
matters
cognizable
under
the
grievance
machinery.
it
would
not
strike
the
restrict
--
strike
activity
as
to
matters
that
do
not
come
under
settlement
of
local
dispute
section.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
no.
there
would
be
others.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
memorial
stoppages
would
be
one.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
memorials.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
in
times
of
mine
disasters
quite
often
you
have
what
is
called,
“memorial
stoppages”
and
stop
working
for
a
day
or
two.
it's
quite
frequent,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
in
case
this
contract
were
extended,
beyond
the
term
of
this
contract,
if
it
were
extended,
doing
the
negotiation
--
negotiating
period,
if
the
men
struck
in
behalf
of
the
negotiation
of
the
new
contract
that
would
become
under.
i'd
say
if
a
matter
of
safety
arose,
if
the
men
quit
work
because
they
did
not
think
the
mine
was
safe,
if
that
was
the
impelling
motive,
i
don't
think
that
would
come
along.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
no
--
those
--
those
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
you
don't
find
that
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
--
in
agreement.
i
was
merely
answering
your
question
sir
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
--
as
to
what
other
types
of
strikes.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
because
i
lived
in
the
cold
fields,
and
i
remember.
[laughter]
it's
not
mentioned
in
the
contract
just
from
knowledge.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
mr.
boyle
had
some
evidence
regarding
that
negotiation,
sir.
i
don't
recall
whether
he
is
specifically
said
so
or
not.
he
did
say
they
were
cancelled.
he
gave
--
he
did
state
that
thereafter,
they
had
the
right
to
strike
which,
of
course,
i
would
consider
conclusion.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
the
portion
that
i
remember,
i
think
it's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
he
was
an
administrative
assistant
to
mr.
lewis.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
to
my
knowledge
he
is,
sir.
now,
coming
back,
sir,
your
honors
wished
me
to
go
ahead
to
the
interpretation
not
only
do
we
consider
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
contract,
it's
fundamental
also
that
effect
must
be
given
to
all
the
language
of
the
contract.
now,
i
am
not
unmindful
of
section
1
in
the
miscellaneous
clause
which
says
that
all
previous
no-strike
clause
has
been
cancelled,
but
i
am
mindful
of
the
positive
provisions
in
section
3
of
the
miscellaneous
clause
and
i
say
we
must
give
meaning
to
section
3
if
we
can
and
if
we
can
do
so
without
derogating
from
other
sections
or
conflicting
from
other
sections.
we
can
do
that.
we
can
also
give
meaning
to
section
1,
as
i
have
already
explained.
to
cancel
a
right
to
strike
is
not
to
state
the
opposite.
to
cancel
a
no-strike
clause
is
not
to
state
the
opposite,
it's
merely
to
put
them
in
the
position
as
though
there
had
been
no
former
clauses
or,
as
i
stated,
the
right
to
strike
is
retained
as
to
other
matters
that
are
not
cognizable
under
this
settlement
of
dispute
section.
a
cancellation
of
a
previous
clause
is
not
a
positive
assertion
that
you
can
strike
for
any
matter,
whatsoever.
or
that
you
can
strike
for
any
matter
that
must
be
taken
up
as
provided
in
section
3.
i
refer
so
to
the
interpretation
by
the
parties.
the
brief
filed
by
the
union
disagrees
with
me,
but
i
still
insist
that
the
letter
is
contained
on
page
12
of
my
brief.
it
was
set
in
1951
by
the
union
officers
to
all
of
the
locals
and
members
of
the
united
mine
workers,
indicate
that
at
that
time,
the
union
officers
considered
that
an
unauthorized
strike
was
a
breach
because
in
that
letter
it
said,
"unauthorized
strikes
reflect
discredit
upon
our
organization
60-year
record
of
honoring
contractual
provisions
and
result
unstrained
labor
relations
between
the
parties
signatory
to
the
joint
agreements.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i'd
say
to
that,
i
believe
in
gentlemen's
agreements,
let's
put
that
first,
but
i'd
still
think
it
--
well,
a
gentlemen's
agreement
should
be
enforced
as
well
as
anything
else,
but
the
question
is
whether
it's
enforceable.
i
think
section
3
answers
that
because
section
3
expressly
says
the
contracting
parties
agree
that
as
a
part
of
the
consideration
of
this
contract,
any
and
all
disputes,
stoppages,
suspensions
of
work
and
claims
and
so
forth
shall
be
by
the
contracting
parties
settled
and
determined
exclusively
by
the
machinery
provided.
i
say
that
when
judge
madden
calls
that
a
mere
gentlemen's
agreement,
he
is,
in
effect,
giving
no
effect
to
that
clause
and
the
fundamental
principles
require
that
effect
be
given
if
he
can't.
i
am
aware
of
that
decision
nlrb
versus
umw
of
justice
madden's
opinion.
that
case
and
this
case,
are
probably
the
reasons
that
we
are
here
today,
that
is
we've
got
two
circuit
courts
of
appeals
that
came
to
different
conclusions.
i
realize
that
this
court
is
not
bound
about
the
decisions
of
the
two
circuit
courts
of
appeal
but,
of
course,
their
reasons
and
the
collective
thought
of
all
those
justices
are
persuasive.
and
i'd
like
to
remind
the
court
this.
that
that
was
a
split
decision
that
only
two
justices
came
to
that
conclusion
and
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
in
this
case,
of
course,
all
three
justices
came
to
the
conclusion,
which
i
am
insisting
upon,
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
national
labor
relations
board
came
to
the
same
conclusion
that
we
insist
upon
on
this
point.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
madden,
judge
fahy
and
judge
burger
was
the
dissenting
judge,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
that
i
don't
know,
sir.
i
don't
know
their
previous
connection.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
and
in
addition
to
that,
if
we
give
the
cancellation
clause
the
correct
interpretation,
we've
got
the
three
judges
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
hazel
case
and
the
three
judges
in
the
first
circuit
in
the
mead
case,
which
came
to
the
same
conclusion
that
i
am
insisting
upon.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
in
the
first
circuit,
you
did
not
to
collective
bargaining
history.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
you
--
you
did
have
a
contract
with
a
--
did
--
did
not
have
a
no-strike
clause.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
mr.
justice,
i
think
you
should
consider
the
history
but
i
don't
think
the
history
push
--
strains
the
interpretation
as
far
as
the
union
claims
or
as
judge
madden
claims.
i
think
to
push
the
history
that
far
or
to
have
the
history
push
your
conclusion
that
far,
means
you
got
to
disregard
the
other
section
3
and
just
determine
the
gentlemen's
agreement.
now,
i
think
the
basic
fallacy
of
judge
madden's
decision
is
that
he
ignored
section
3
and
merely
termed
it
a
gentlemen's
agreement.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
he
--
he
realize
that
there
was
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
to
restrain
the
cancellation
--
to
clear
the
cancellation
clause
to
the
extent
that
he
carried
it
and
to
the
extent
that
these
gentlemen
are
insisting
upon,
you've
got
to
ignore
section
3.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
the
striking
is
a
breach
if
it's
for
the
purpose
of
settling.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
if
it
becomes
a
method
of
settling
other
than
the
agreed
on
exclusive
method,
we
must
give
that
word,
“exclusive”
its
proper
meaning
too,
sir.
during
my
remaining
time,
sir,
i
--
i'd
like
to
cover
a
couple
other
points
that
mr.
boiarsky
brought
up.
mr.
boiarsky
stated
that
the
parties
could
not
have
expressed
their
right
to
strike
in
more
definite
language
and
he
was
referring
to
the
cancellation
clause
in
the
parties
in
the
1947
agreement.
in
other
words,
when
you
cancel
an
abrogate,
previous
no-strike
clause,
mr.
boiarsky
says
you
could
have
not
have
express
the
right
to
strike
in
more
--
in
more
definite
language.
i
say
you
could
have.
you
could
have
come
out
and
say
it
that
all
disputes
will
be
settled
by
the
machinery
in
the
contract
exclusively.
however,
you
still
you
have
your
right
to
strike
over
disputes.
if
that
has
been
what
they
meant
and
if
that
had
been
what
they
wanted,
they
could
have
used
more
definitive
language
to
retain
the
right
to
strike
for
dispute-settling
purposes.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir,
he
could.
we
said
it
could've,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
your
honors,
i
think
it
isn't
--
it
is
very
definite
[laughs].
i
hope
your
honors
will
construe
it
the
way
it
is.
i
mean
the
way
we
insist
that
--
what
--
the
way
we
insist,
it
contains
the
intended
parties.
now,
mr.
boiarsky
stated
that
the
purpose
of
the
union
in
1947
and
of
course
in
1950
was
to
avoid
the
impact
of
damage
actions
brought
under
301,
when
that
cancellation
followed
the
court.
well,
at
the
same
time,
clause
3
was
put,
which
said,
“you
will
settle
disputes
exclusively
by
the
said
machinery.”
in
considering
the
purpose
of
the
contracting
parties,
you
should
consider
not
only
the
purpose
of
the
union
when
they
want
to
get
out
of
--
avoid
damage
actions,
but
we
must
also
consider
the
purpose
of
the
operators.
it
is
certain
that
the
operators,
when
they
put
in
clause
3,
but
wanting
some
clause
that
would
give
them
a
continuity
of
operation
pending
this
little
local
matters.
and
mr.
boiarsky
also
cited
the
lion
oil
company
case
versus
--
nlrb
versus
the
lion
oil
company
case
to
the
effect
that
where
there
has
been
no
expressed
waiver
of
the
right
to
strike,
the
waiver
of
the
right
doing
such
a
period
is
not
to
be
inferred.
this
case
is
good
as
far
as
it
goes,
but
it
does
not
fit
this
situation.
in
the
lion
case,
we
had
a
dispute
over
the
modification
of
the
very
terms
of
the
contract
--
correction,
we
had
a
strike
over
the
modification
of
the
very
terms
of
the
contract.
and
as
the
court
stated
on
page
340
of
one
lawyers'
edition
2d,
here,
the
strike
occurred
at
a
time
when
the
parties
were
bargaining
over
modifications
after
notice
and
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
contract
where
there
has
been
no
expressed
waiver
of
the
right
to
strike,
a
waiver
of
the
right
doing
such
a
period
is
not
to
be
inferred.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
two-phased
provision
for
determine
--
for
terminating
this
contract
means
that
it
was
not
within
the
contemplation
of
the
parties
that
economic
weapons
might
be
used
to
support
demands
for
modification
before
the
notice
to
terminate
was
given.
now,
that
is
a
key
distinction,
as
i
see
it,
sir.
we
do
not
say
there
is
no
right
to
strike
during
the
negotiating
process
for
the
contract
itself.
and
that's
what
the
lion
case
covers,
the
negotiating
process
for
the
modification
of
the
contract
itself.
and
the
court
was
careful
to
use
that
a
waiver
of
the
right
doing
such
a
period
is
not
to
be
inferred.
that
is
doing
the
negotiation
period
for
a
modification.
we
say
that
during
the
process
of
bargaining
for
a
collective
contract,
labor
should
not
give
up
his
right
to
strike
because
it
--
it
is
its
best
economic
weapon.
but
when
you
come
down
to
the
case
where
after
you
have
gotten
your
contract
and
going
to
work
on
it
and
then
you
have
a
dispute
because
some
man
is
discharged
for
absenteeism.
we
say
that
the
union
has
limited
its
right
to
strike
over
that
little
local
matter,
and
that
was
their
intent.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
the
1950
and
the
1952,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
no
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
no
substantial
difference.
i
will
state
that
i
think
the
1950
contract
is
stronger
from
my
position.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
administrative
assistant
to
mr.
lewis,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
that
was
concerning
the
best
efforts
clause
to
use
the
best
efforts
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
is
section
3.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i
would
think
so,
because
he's
talking
to
the
both
of
them.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
yes.
a
portion
of
his
testimony
in
which
he
states
that
after
the
1947
contract
to
sign,
they
had
the
right
to
strike
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
--
i
would
contend
that
that's
a
conclusion
to
the
witness
though,
i
--
i
don't,
of
course,
don't
agree
with
it.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
whether
he
was
referring
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
--
to
section
3
specifically,
i
don't
know,
sir.
i
don't
recall
--
i
do
remember
him
saying
that
--
giving
that
answer,
but
i
don't
--
couldn't
say
whether
he's
referring
to
section
3.
coming
back
to
that,
sir,
i
state
we
--
we
should
consider
not
only
what
the
union
was
wishing
and
what
their
purpose
was,
but
also
what
the
company
was
wishing
and
what
their
purpose
was.
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
well,
sir.
i
thank
your
honors
--
mr.
robert
t.
winston,
jr.
i
believe
you
understand
my
position,
and
thank
you,
sir.
