the
matter
--
the
matter
whether
as
trustees
they
are
third-party
beneficiaries
or
not,
isn't
all
that's
important
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
you're
entitled
to
the
funds
in
the
trust
capacity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
my
whole
point
is
this.
whatever
rights
your
trustees
have,
the
right
upon
this
contract
and
whether
you
call
them
third-party
beneficiaries
or
something
else,
doesn't
affect
the
substance
of
their
right.
is
that
not
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
didn't
understand
that
there
was
a
dispute,
that
they
are
property
as
union's
funds,
nor
that
the
funds
to
which
they
become
entitled
derived
under
the
terms
of
this
contract.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
therefore
i
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
that
depend
on
the
terms
of
the
contract?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
not
crucial
for
you
(inaudible)
that
benedict's
is
not
an
issue
it's
just
a
debt,
but
money
paid
into
or
due
and
owing
to
the
fund
it
is
trust
funds
in
the
hands
of
the
trustees,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
why
i
can't
see
why
you
keep
saying
that
funds
in
the
hands
of
predicate
who
entrusted
these
funds.
do
you
immediately
see
whether
it
was
simply
debt
then
it's
money
due
and
owing
to
the
trustee.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
think
benedict
would
ever
be
a
trustee
of
one
whole
trust
formation
just
recently
for
paying
money
in
the
hands
of
these
trustees
who
signed
up
for
the
contract
as
authorized
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
any
and
all
disputes
have
looked
around
this
pursuit
of
game.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
look
what
i
just
(inaudible)
with
the
acknowledging
of
the
right
to
strike
in
all
(inaudible)
of
dispute
we
need
to
reach
a
decision
to
be
done
