mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
upon
complaint
that
the
united
mine
workers
of
america
and
the
district
28
of
the
united
mine
workers
have
violated
the
national
bituminous
coal
wage
agreements
1950
and
1952
by
reason
of
pertinent
strikes,
the
district
court
entered
a
judgment
upon
a
jury
verdict
against
the
union
for
a
sum
in
excess
of
$81,000.
the
agreement
did
not
contain
any
express
no-strike
clause
or
any
other
expressive
waver
or
restriction
or
limitation
upon
that
right.
the
agreements,
however,
did
cancel
previous
no-strike
clauses
contained
in
prior
contracts.
the
agreements
also
contained
grievance
machinery
procedure
and
in
each
of
the
strike
situations
involved
when
district
28
represented
these
were
called
concerning
stoppages,
the
grievances
were
settled
and
the
miners
returned
to
work.
in
both
of
the
lower
courts,
the
unions
contended
that
the
agreements
had
preserved
the
right
to
strike
without
restriction
or
limitation.
both
courts
rejected
this
position.
and
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court
on
the
issue
of
liability.
but
because
of
errors
relating
to
damages,
it
remanded
the
case
solely
for
re-determination
of
the
amount
of
damages.
petitioners
sought
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
that
judgment
on
numerous
points,
but
this
court
granted
cert
limited,
however,
to
the
question
of
whether
a
stoppage
of
work,
pending
supplement
of
the
dispute
comestible
under
the
grievance
machinery
procedures
of
the
1950
contract
is
proscribed
by
that
agreement
so
as
to
subject
the
two
unions,
the
mine
workers
in
district
28
the
damage
actions
under
taft-hartley
section
301.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
the
history
of
collective
bargaining
in
the
bituminous
coal
industry
in
this
country
shows
that
prior
to
the
year
1947
when
the
taft-hartley
act
was
enacted,
providing
for
damage
actions
against
labor
unions
for
breach
of
contracts
the
prior
agreements
preceding
1947
contained
express
waivers
of
the
right
to
strike
and
express
prohibitions
against
the
right
to
strike.
the
1941
and
1945
agreements
for
example
as
found
on
page
125-a
of
the
printed
record
provided
that
a
strike
or
stoppage
of
work
on
part
of
the
mine
workers
shall
be
a
violation
of
this
agreement.
it
provided
that
for
the
duration
of
the
agreement
no
strikes
shall
be
called
or
maintained
hereunder.
it
provided
also
that
under
no
circumstances
shall
the
operator
discuss
the
matter
under
dispute
with
the
mine
committee
or
any
representative
of
the
united
mine
workers
of
america
during
suspension
of
work
in
violation
of
the
agreement.
and
i
want
particularly
your
honors
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
language
found
in
the
1941
agreement
which
was
carried
forward
into
the
1945
agreement
and
it
is
found
and
i
emphasize
that
it
is
found
under
the
settlement
of
dispute
section
and
it
says
and
i
read
from
the
record,
printed
record
page
124-a
pending
the
hearing
of
disputes,
the
mine
workers
shall
not
cease
work
because
of
any
dispute.
now
in
1947
with
the
enactment
of
the
taft-hartley
act
with
this
section
301
imposing
civil
sanctions
upon
labor
unions
for
breach
of
contract
the
united
mine
workers
was
no
longer
willing
to
subject
itself
to
a
damage
action
by
reason
of
any
provision
in
the
contract
which
prohibited
the
right
to
strike.
it
provided
for
example
that
the
earlier
contracts
were
to
be
carried
forward,
but
it
provided
specifically
that
the
no-strike
covenants
of
the
preceding
contracts
were
rendered
null
and
void
and
abrogated
and
cancelled.
mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
that's
correct,
yes.
i
now
read
from
page
129-a
of
the
record,
any
and
all
provisions
in
either
the
appalachian
joint
wage
agreement
of
july
19,
1941
or
the
national
bituminous
coal
wage
agreement
of
april
11,
1945
containing
any
no-strike
or
penalty
clause
or
clauses
or
any
clause
denominated
the
illegal
suspension
of
work
are
hereby
rescinded,
cancelled,
abrogated
and
made
null
and
void.
now
in
the
same
contract
and
under
subsection
three
of
the
same
section
which
is
headed
miscellaneous,
the
contracting
parties
agree
that
as
a
part
of
the
consideration
of
this
contract,
any
and
all
disputes,
stoppages,
suspensions
of
work
and
any
and
all
claims,
demands
or
actions
going
there
from
or
involve
therein
shall
be
by
the
contracting
parties
settled
and
determined
exclusively
by
the
machinery
provided
in
the
settlement
of
local
and
district
dispute
section
of
this
agreement
or
if
national
in
character
by
the
poor
use
of
free
collective
bargaining
as
heretofore
known
the
practice
in
the
industry.
the
1948
contract
carried
forward
the
1947
agreement
and
in
1950
the
same
provisions
were
carried
forward
but
there
was
added
to
the
1950
contract,
subsection
(4)
of
the
miscellaneous
section
which
provided
that
both
the
united
mine
workers
of
america
and
the
operators
affirmed
their
intention
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
this
contract
and
to
exercise
their
best
efforts
to
available
disciplinary
measures
to
prevent
stoppages
of
work
by
strike
or
lockup
pending
adjustment
or
adjudication
of
disputes
and
grievances
in
the
manner
provided
in
this
agreement.
the
sixth
circuit
declared
that
the
agreement
expressly
stated
that
the
no-strike
provisions
of
the
previous
contracts
were
superseded.
they
admitted
that,
but
it
declared
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
strikes
violated
the
contract
depended
upon
what
affect
the
agreement
to
settle
all
local
disputes
in
accordance
with
the
settlement
of
local
and
disputes
district
disputes
procedures
had
upon
the
right
to
strike.
it
concluded
that
a
strike
to
settle
a
dispute
which
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
provides
shall
be
settled
by
an
exclusive
and
obligatory
alternative
procedure
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
now
it
said
that
if
that
did
not
render
meaningless
the
express
abrogation
of
the
no-strike
clause.
but
it
said
that
the
right
to
strike
was
preserved
with
respect
to
all
disputes
not
subject
to
settlement
by
other
methods
made
exclusive
by
the
agreements
and
though
it
professed
that
the
unions
remain
free
from
liability
for
spontaneous
or
wild
cat
strike
which
they
defined
as
the
kind
of
stoppages
and
suspensions
of
work
which
the
agreement
made
subject
to
the
settlement
procedure,
it
concluded
that
the
particular
strikes
which
are
involved
here
resulted
from
localized
labor
disputes
which
were
cognizable
under
the
grievance
machinery,
and
therefore,
the
unions
were
liable.
now
it's
the
position
of
the
unions
that
strike
activity
pending
the
settlement
of
disputes
under
the
grievance
machinery
of
the
contract
was
a
permissive
and
not
a
prohibited
activity.
the
unions
say
that
the
collective
bargaining
history
is
enlightening
upon
the
intention
of
the
parties.
it
says
that
as
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
in
the
case
of
international
union
united
mine
workers
of
america
versus
the
national
labor
relations
board,
which
involved
an
interpretation
of
the
1952
agreement
and
which
is
found
in
257
f
.2d
of
page
211.
mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
257
f
.2d,
211,
that
the
bargaining
history
was
both
interesting
and
enlightening.
now
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
gave
no
consideration
to
that
collective
bargaining
history.
the
court
will
recall
that
in
the
1941
and
1945
agreements
that
in
the
section
of
the
contracts
which
provided
for
the
grievance
machinery
itself
that
that
section
committed
the
mine
workers
to
a
no-strike
clause.
now
we
say
that
in
1947
with
the
adoption
of
section
301
of
the
act
that
you
have
to
consider
for
example
that
even
though
congress
recognized
that
--
and
sought
in
that
act
to
reduce
strikes
in
industrial
unrest
its
legislative
history
supported
the
position
that
the
right
to
strike
was
preserved
and
that
the
question
of
the
waiver
of
a
right
to
strike
was
in
matter
for
collective
bargaining
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
parties
in
the
1947
and
1940
and
1950
contracts
did.
they
preserved
the
right
to
strike
by
providing
in
there
for
the
deletion,
for
the
abrogation
of
the
no-strike
clauses
that
had
occurred
in
previous
contracts.
we
say
that
unless
clear
language
has
lost
its
meaning
that
no
--
that
the
parties
could
not
have
expressed
the
right
to
strike
in
more
definitive
and
unambiguous
verbiage
than
they
did.
that
the
right
to
strike
was
no
longer
waived
but
was
reinstated.
if
the
contracting
parties
had
intended
that
there
should
be
no
work
stoppages
pending
settlement
of
disputes
under
the
grievance
machinery,
we
ask
the
question,
“why
should
they
have
so
studiously
provided
for
the
recession
of
such
clauses
and
that
they
should
not
be
applicable,
and
that
they
should
be
rendered
null
and
void?”
now
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
case
that
i
have
cited,
says
it
is
hardly
conceivable
that
a
stoppage
of
work
could
occur
except
as
a
consequence
of
a
dispute
which
would
be
cognizable
under
the
grievance
procedure
of
the
contract.
and
that
being
so,
what
was
eliminated
unequivocally
in
subsection
one
was
restored
completely
in
subsection
three
if
subsection
three
was
a
no-strike
agreement,
but
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
continued
saying,
“if
we
are
to
credit
the
parties
with
normal
capacity
to
reason
and
express
themselves,
we
cannot
read
subsection
three
as
a
no-strike
agreement.”
we
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
national
labor
relations
board
versus
lion
oil
company
which
is
found
in
352
u.s.
at
page
282
where
the
court
declared
that
where
there
has
been
no
express
waiver
of
the
right
to
strike
a
waiver
of
the
right
during
such
period
is
not
to
be
inferred.
we
also
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
language
found
in
the
act
in
section
13
which
declares
that
nothing
in
the
act
except
as
specifically
prohibited
shall
be
construed
so
as
either
to
interfere
with
or
impede
or
diminish
in
anyway
the
right
to
strike.
now
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
pointing
to
that
language
says
it
seems
to
us
that
the
spirit
of
the
section
is
an
admonition
to
deciding
tribunals
not
to
interpret
ambiguous
provisions
of
contracts
as
amounting
to
no-strike
agreements.
mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
mr.
justice
our
position
here
is
that
it
is
one
thing
for
contracting
parties
to
agree
to
process
matters
to
the
grievance
machinery,
and
that
is
precisely
what
took
place
here.
we
say
that
it
is
an
entirely
different
matter
for
parties
to
agree
not
to
strike
pending
the
settlement
of
those
disputes.
we
say
that
they
are
two
entirely
different
things,
and
that
that
distinction
was
recognized
by
the
parties
in
the
earlier
contracts
when
they
said
specifically
that
pending
the
hearing
of
disputes
that
the
miners
would
not
strike.
we
say
that
the
fact
that
those
provisions
were
in
the
earlier
contracts
that
they
were
cancelled
and
rendered
null
and
void
gives
basic
content
to
the
intention
of
the
parties
and
the
interpretation
to
be
placed
upon
this
contract
that
when
the
parties
in
subsection
(1)
of
the
miscellaneous
section
cancelled
the
no-strike
clauses
that
they
cancelled
them
totally
and
unequivocally.
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
parties
to
the
contract
that
the
right
to
strike
was
reinstated,
that
the
unions
were
not
to
be
subject
to
legal
sanctions
under
section
301
by
virtue
of
strike
activity.
and
so
we
say
that
that
a
strike
is
not
an
alternative
method
of
settling
a
dispute.
we
say
that
as
the
court
said
in
the
tri-city's
foundry
case
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
that
the
strike
is
an
economic,
a
lawful
economic
instant
and
that
just
as
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
stated
in
the
textile
workers
case
which
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief,
that
there
is
no
inconsistency,
there
is
not
the
slightest
inconsistency
between
genuine
desire
to
come
to
an
agreement
and
use
of
economic
pressure
to
get
the
kind
of
agreement
one
wants,
we
cite
that
on
page
seven
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
i
do
not.
i
think
it's
clearly
distinguishable.
mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
there
in
the
meat
case
your
honor,
in
the
first
place
there
was
an
arbitration
clause.
it
did
not
have
as
we
have
in
this
particular
case
a
prior
no-strike
clause
where
the
parties
negotiated
those
no-strike
clauses
out
of
the
contract
itself.
mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
i
think
your
honor
that
you
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
history
of
the
collective
bargaining
of
the
various
contracts.
i
think
you
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
purposes
which
prompted
the
union
in
1947
and
again
in
1950
to
eliminate
those
no-strike
clauses.
the
purpose
of
the
union
to
avoid
the
impact
of
damage
actions
brought
under
section
301.
now
the
sixth
circuit
has
not
undertaken
to
do
either.
they've
given
no
consideration
to
the
purposes
which
brought
about
the
change
from
the
1941
and
1945
contracts
and
the
1947
contract,
they've
given
no
consideration
to
the
--
mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
but
when
--
when
you
consider
and
now
i
get
back
to
the
meat
case,
your
honor,
a
reading
of
the
meat
case
particularly
in
the
district
court
shows
that
the
district
judge
premised
his
findings
upon
evidence
which
had
been
taken
which
showed
that
the
union
was
not
particularly
attempting
to
protect
its
right
to
strike
and
the
opinion
so
recites
and
the
opinion
also
recites
your
honor.
if
i
may
point
to
your
justice
for
a
moment,
the
court
indicates
that
he
was
not
absolutely
certain
of
his
position,
but
he
says
this.
the
parole
evidence
which
i
believed
tends
in
the
same
direction
as
a
constructu
--
contracture
which
i
give
the
agreement
as
a
matter
of
law
but
not
very
strongly.
it
tends
more
in
that
direction
however
than
in
the
direction
of
the
union's
contention
that
by
omitting
this
no-strike
clause
it
was
preserving
its
full
and
free
right
to
strike.
now
we
say
that
that
is
not
true
in
this
case,
but
the
thing
that
the
union
was
doing
was
expressly
by
eliminating
the
previous
no-strike
clauses
expressly
preserving
his
right
to
strike
totally
and
unequivocally.
mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
they
have
left
in
here
a
specific
mode
of
--
mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
--
of
processing
disputes
but
--
mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
well
they
say
--
they
say
your
honor,
any
and
all
disputes.
mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
and
not
only
that
but
--
mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
yes.
mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
well
if
they're
national
and
in
character
that's
a,
that's
a
different
thing
yes.
mr.
m.e.
boiarsky
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
restriction
upon
the
right
to
strike
placed
in
subsection
three.
we
say
that
that
so
for
as
the
local
and
district
disputes
are
concerned
that
there
is
a
requirement
under
subsection
three
that
those
matters
be
processed
as
the
contract
provides
namely
to
the
grievance
machinery
if
it
is
local
if
it
is
national
in
character
then
it
is
done
by
the
process
of
pre-collective
bargaining
as
heretofore
practiced
in
the
industry.
now
the
word
exclusive
and
again
i
reiterate
that
it
was
that
--
that
it
is
one
thing
to
agree
to
process
grievances
through
the
grievance
machinery.
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
if
the
dispute
is
national
in
character
that
it
will
be
done
through
the
collective
bargaining
as
heretofore
practiced,
but
it
is
something
entirely
different
to
say
that
during
the
processing
of
those
disputes,
that
the
unions
and
the
miners
are
committed
to
a
no-strike
condition.
