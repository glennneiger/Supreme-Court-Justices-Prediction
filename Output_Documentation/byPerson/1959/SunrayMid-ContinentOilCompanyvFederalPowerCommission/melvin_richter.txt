the
court.
this
is
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
it
involves
the
question
which
is
similar
to
one
of
the
issues
which
was
discussed
in
the
sun
oil
case
in
which
argument
has
just
been
concluded.
the
question
here
relates
to
the
commission's
authority
under
section
7
(e)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
generally,
to
issue
certificates
of
unlimited
duration
where
the
applicant
has
explicitly
sought
a
certificate,
coextensive
in
duration
with
the
term
of
his
gas
sales
contract.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
as
there
was
in
sun
oil
as
to
rates
whether
initial
rates,
the
rates
changes.
nor
there
is
any
question
here,
again
if
there
was
in
sun
oil,
as
to
the
scope
of
a
certificate
that
was
issued
earlier
or
the
propriety
of
issuing
a
second
certificate.
in
this
case,
there's
been
no
previous
sale
of
the
gas
involved
in
interstate
commerce.
if
here,
sunray
applied
for
certificate
to
sell
the
gas
in
interstate
commerce
for
the
first
time,
its
application
unequivocally
requested
that
the
certificate
be
coextensive
with
the
term
of
his
gas
sales
contract.

to

and
the
commission
clearly
so
understood.
briefly,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
these.
sun
ray
is
an
integrated
company
engaged
in
virtually
all
spaces
of
the
oil
business.
in
addition
at
present,
it
is
producing
and
selling
natural
gas
under
about
a
160
long
term
contracts,
most
of
which
offer
terms
of
20
years
or
more.
and
i
might
add
by
the
way
at
this
point
that
about
85%
of
the
gap
produces
contracts
in
the
industry
offer
terms
of
20
years
or
more.
sun
ray
also
produces
substantial
qualities
of
crude
oil
and
frequently
in
conjunction
with
natural
gas.
sun
ray
refines
the
crude
oil
into
fuel
oil,
to
gasoline
and
other
products
and
sell
these
various
products
to
the
public
and
to
the
government.
by
contract
dated
february
--
january
1,
1957,
sunray
agreed
to
sell
united
gas
pipeline
company
gas
produced
from
certain
lands
and
acreage
owned
by
it
in
lafayette
and
vermilion
parishes
in
louisiana.
at
present,
sunray
is
only
known
of
proving
gas
reserves
in
this
area
are
in
a
small
portion
thereof
known
as
the
“ridge
field,”
and
this
is
in
lafayette
parish.
the
total
area
involved
here
that's
dedicated
to
this
contract
about
33
square
miles
of
which
sunray
owns
about
7000
acres.
a
very
small
proportion
of
those
7
---
7000
acres
have
been
developed
and
have
proven
to
have
gas
reserves.
under
the
contract,
sunray
is
to
deliver
in
united's
tank
annual
minimum
quantities
about
4.5%
of
the
estimated
reserves.
the
united
in
addition
is
to
have
a
further
right,
annually
to
take
up
to
an
additional
50%
of
this,
amounted
about
6
close
to
7%,
just
right
7%.
that's
the
maximum
take
of
united.
as
i
mentioned
before,
this
acreage
is
in
the
haul
of
a
ballistic
gas
fields
in
south
louisiana
and
it's
expected
for
the
great
deal
of
confidence
that
additional
gas
will
be
discovered
in
this
dedicated
area.
subject
to
certain
conditions
not
here
relevant,
these
additional
reserves
are
to
be
included
under
the
contract.
however,
such
inclusion
is
only
for
the
remainder
of
the
20-year
term
from
the
time
when
these
additional
reserves
are
discovered.
in
other
words,
if
a
--
if
an
additional
reserve
is
discovered,
say
10
years
from
now,
that
reserve
goes
into
under
the
contract
only
perspectively.
and
under
the
term
of
the
contract
will
definitely
be
gas
left
at
the
end
of
the
20-year
period.
these
specific
quantities
of
gas
as
--
are
to
be
sold
and
delivered
for
a
basic
term
of
20
years.
highlighting
the
fact
that
the
contract
is
for
the
specific
quantity
of
gas,
is
the
provision
that
of
sunray
should
use
any
of
the
gas
for
re-pressuring
or
recycling
operations
so
that
it
cannot
deliver
the
fourth
or
annual
minimum
to
united
in
any
specific
year,
the
contract
is
to
be
extended
for
a
sufficient
period
of
time
to
make
up
to
deficiency.
in
other
words,
united
has
a
guarantee,
they
will
get
the
annual
minimum
for
20
years
and
it
can
take
up
to
50%
additional.
that
is
the
range
under
with
--
of
gas
that's
sold
and
under
this
contract.
on
march
11,
1957,
sunray
applied
to
the
commission
for
authority
to
sell
this
gas
under
this
contract
to
united
under
section
7
(a)
of
the
natural
gas
act.
that
section
provides
impertinent
power
set
out
on
page
12
of
our
brief,
among
other
places,
in
full
it's
set
out
on
page
57
and
58
of
our
brief
but
the
pertinent
language
with
which
we're
concerned
here
is
set
out
on
page
12.
and
that
provides
that
a
certificate
shall
be
issued
to
any
qualified
applicant,
authorizing
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
sale,
on
the
leading
language
we
cluster
out
as
the
sales
service
operation,
construction
etcetera,
but
the
--
we're
--
we're
concerned
with
the
hearsay.
covered
by
the
application
if
it
is
found
that
the
applicant
is
willing
--
is
able
and
willing
properly
to
do
the
acts
and
to
perform
the
service
proposed
and
that
the
proposed
sale
and
again
i'm
leading
some
words,
to
the
extent
required
by
the
certificate
is
or
will
be
required
by
the
present
of
future
public
convenience
necessity.
and
then
this
--
it
goes
on,
“otherwise,
such
application
shall
be
denied.”
the
commission
can't
make
an
affirmative
finding
that
--
that
the
application
is
--
the
terms
and
conditions
of
which
the
application
is
made
accords
with
the
public
interest
that
has
the
authority
absolutely
to
deny
the
application.
there
are
further
provisions
in
the
statute
in
section
7
(e)
relating
to
a
conditioning
but
it's
not
involved
in
this
case
with
no
rate
condition
problem
here.
the
application
as
i
mentioned
initially,
specifically
requested
a
certificate
coextensive
in
term
with
the
contract.
that
as
for
the
contract
--
the
certificate
being
for
the
basic
term
of
20
years.
after
hearing
and
which
the
only
evidence
introduced
with
regard
to
the
duration
of
the
certificate
was
by
sunray.
the
commission,
despite
--
despite
sunray's
specific
request
issued
a
certificate
of
unlimited
duration.
the
commission,
with
the
approval
of
the
court
below,
assumed
that
the
act
established
a
presumption
that
certificates
are
to
be
unlimited
in
duration.
based
on
this
presumption,
the
commission
ruled
that
sunray
had
not
made
out
a
case
justifying
the
issuance
of
a
limited
certificate.
in
other
words,
so
far
as
the
commission
was
concerned,
all
certificates
are
--
are
to
be
of
unlimited
duration
unless
there
is
a
showing
of
special
circumstances
justifying
initial
in
service
certificate
of
limited
duration.
it's
our
position
that
the
--
that
exactly
the
converse
is
true.
this
presumption
--
mr.
melvin
richter
sir.
mr.
melvin
richter
no,
sir.
it
was
the
general
presumption
that
the
commission
indulges
in
presumably
as
mr.
wahrenbrock
has
indicated
in
his
argument
in
the
sun
oil
case,
the
statute
is
a
--
as
a
broad
public
utility
ramifications
and
one
of
the
necessary
obligations
under
a
public
utility
statute
is
a
presumption
of
indefinite
service.
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
i
would
assume
not
--
i
--
for
obvious
reasons.
it's
commissions
with
--
mr.
melvin
richter
commission
ignored
the
contract.
mr.
melvin
richter
that's
right.
mr.
melvin
richter
we'll
give
you
a
--
presumptively,
the
certificates
ought
of
be
of
an
indefinite
duration.
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
maybe
you
might
have
--
mr.
melvin
richter
they
--
the
commission's
view
apparently
is
and
i
have
limited
time
and
i
prefer
trust
of
the
addressed
question,
well,
i'm
quite
--
as
--
as
i
understand
the
commission's
view,
i
would
like
--
is
that
this
nature
of
the
statute
inherent
in
the
very
nature
of
the
statute.
the
mere
fact
that
congress
in
act
of
the
natural
gas
act
with
various
rate
provisions,
certificate
provisions
etcetera
that
that
carried
with
it
a
presumption
that
all
certificates
issued
out
of
the
--
of
indefinite
duration
unless
special
circumstances
were
shown,
justifying
the
issuance
of
a
special
certificate.
we
come
back
to
mobile.
in
mobile,
the
commission's
position
was
some
--
substantially
the
same.
in
mobile
they
said,
“sure,
the
contracts
are
entitled
to
or
preserved
under
the
statute
but
the
act
by
virtue
of
public
utility
filed
rate
procedures,”
the
terminology
they
used.
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
statute
permits
the
overriding
freely
of
contracts
and
the
court
rejected
them
then.
and
we
think
they
ought
to
reject
them
here
again.
but
basically
this
presumption
which
they
have
involved
appears
to
be
have
founded
upon
three
erroneous
premises,
that
we
understand
it.
one
is
an
asserted
purpose
and
policy
of
the
act
to
assure
indefinite
continuity
of
service.
second,
a
cargo
of
policy
derived
from
the
provisions
of
section
7
(b)
of
the
act
relating
to
abandonment.
and
third,
an
alleged
the
--
they're
contrary
result
or
enable
applicants
to
“dictate”
the
terms
on
which
they
will
sell
their
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
in
light
of
the
limitations
of
time,
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
go
in
a
great
detail
into
the
various
ramifications
of
our
position.
i
would
like
to
just
hit
some
of
the
highlights
here.
as
i
say,
it's
our
position
that
where
an
applicant
applies
for
authority
to
sell
gas
for
a
period
coextensive
with
the
sales
contract,
the
commission's
authority
is
limited
generally
or
i
say
generally,
to
issuing
a
certificate
for
that
term.
section
7
(e)
of
the
act
which
i've
just
read
expressly
so
states
as
we
read
it,
as
the
court
recall,
that
section
provides
for
the
issuance
of
a
certificate
authorizing
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
sale
covered
by
the
application.
when
as
in
the
case,
such
as
we
have
here,
the
whole
of
the
application
is
for
a
certificate
of
a
--
for
a
limited
period,
the
issuance
of
a
certificate
for
longer
period
of
time
or
if
indefinite
duration
exceeds
the
bounds
of
the
application
and
the
contract
enhances
not
within
the
commission's
authority
under
section
7
(e).
now,
this
reading
of
section
7
(e),
we
think
does
not
mean
that
the
applicant
is
able
to
dictate
the
terms
and
conditions
under
which
he'll
sell
his
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
this
court
that
latter
in
so
called
capital
atlantic
refining
case
last
term,
held
flatly
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
natural
gas
act
that
precluded
an
applicant
from
standing
firm
on
his
terms
and
conditions
from
making
a
sale
provided
he
haven't
sold
this
gas
yet,
and
this
is
that
type
of
case.
at
the
same
time
however,
the
commission
is
not
required
to
authorize
a
new
sale
unless
it
finds
that
the
applicants
proposed
terms
and
conditions
are
in
the
public
interest.
if
the
commission
finds
that
they
are
on
a
public
interest
they
issue
us
a
certificate.
if
they
find
that
is
not,
they
deny
the
certificate.
and
in
the
course
of
making
that
determination,
there's
no
reason
why
they
cannot
take
into
account
the
term
for
which
the
sale
was
being
made.
they
do
that
everyday
in
the
pipeline
cases.
one
of
the
most
important
factor
in
the
pipeline
certificate
case
is
the
adequacy
of
reserves.
and
the
commission
looks
to
the
reserves
and
if
its
for
less
than
of
prescribed
minimum,
they'll
deny
the
certificate.
if
it's
for
--
meets
their
standards
for
of
minimum
--
of
minimum
requirements,
they'll
grant
it.
and
i
might
point
out
in
addition
that
whereas
here,
we
--
we're
willing
to
sell
the
gas
for
20
years.
in
the
pipeline
cases,
the
commission
is
now
accepting
reserves
down
to
10
and
11
years
as
is
being
adequate
as
in
the
public
interest.
now,
we
want
to
point
out
further
that
this
reading
of
the
section
7
(e)
is
nowhere
conflicts
with
section
7
(b)
of
the
act.
in
order
to
create
a
conflict,
mr.
wahrenbrock
in
the
sun
oil
case
and
he'll
probably
argue
here
again,
seeks
to
read
into
section
7
(b),
a
general
congressional
mandate
to
assure
indefinite
continuity
of
service.
but
section
7
(b)
is
not
that
broad.
the
only
abandonment
authority
granted
by
--
to
the
commission
by
that
section
is
lower
and
i'm
quoting.
“facilities
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
or
any
sale
rendered
by
means
of
such
facilities,
it's
limited
to
certain
kind
of
service
assuming
that
what
sunray
is
doing
here
is
making
a
service.
it's
providing
a
service
rather
than
just
selling
gas.”
now,
we
can
go
back
in
that
point
to
7
(e)
which
has
--
says,
sale
common
service
and
as
sunray
applied
for
was
authority
to
make
a
sale,
not
to
render
a
service.
but
assuming
that
sunray
is
engaged
in
providing
a
service,
there
would
still
be
--
or
even
get
to
whether
or
not
this
is
subject
to
7
(b),
it
says
facility
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
that
is
the
prerequisite,
is
that
you
stop
there
first
and
if
you
--
you
find
facilities,
then
you
go
on
and
service,
but
if
you
don't
find
facilities,
you
don't
have
any
service.
the
same
broad
reading
of
section
7
(b),
i
might
add,
that
the
commission
have
the
case
here
was
advanced
by
it
in
the
panhandle
case
in
337
u.s.
and
with
respect
--
as
--
as
expressly
rejected
by
this
court,
properly
read
as
far
as
we
see
it,
section
7
(b)
is
in
complete
harmony
with
our
reading
of
section
7
(e).
as
we
see
it,
a
certificate
issued
under
section
7
(e)
defines
the
period
definite
or
indefinite.
but
it
defines
the
period
that
the
sale
is
to
be
made
of
the
service
rendered.
we
applied
for
a
certificate
of
limited
duration
and
that
defines
the
scope
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction
to
issue
a
certificate.
section
7
(b)
in
turn
applied
only
when
there
is
an
attempt
to
abandon
service
short
of
the
period
set
out
in
the
contract.
in
other
words,
assuming
that
sunray
is
making
a
sale
of
serve
--
providing
a
service
here
and
it
has
jurisdictional
facilities
so
it's
subject
to
7
(b).
then
sections
--
sale
we
--
and
we
applied
for
a
certificate
of
limited
duration
and
we
obtained
it,
the
commission
gives
it
to
us.
then
sunray
cannot
discontinue
that
self-service
of
sale
within
the
period
so
it's
covered
by
the
certificate,
i.e.
for
20
years
unless
of
course
it
has
to
get
a
commission
approval.
it's
in
no
way
free
to
discontinue
as
it
wishes.
now,
apart
from
section
7
(b),
the
commission
appoints
that
no
provision
in
the
natural
gas
act
vesting
it
the
general
responsibility
to
assure
indefinite
continuity
of
service.
section
7
(a)
on
which
the
court
below
rely
is
very
limited
in
scope
and
indeed
as
the
commission
concedes
in
it's
brief
in
this
case,
does
not
reach
sales
of
gas
by
a
producer
to
a
pipeline
company.
at
this
point,
i'd
like
to
pause
for
a
moment.
mr.
wahrenbrock
mentioned
the
legislative
history
in
sun
oil
of
section
7
(b).
and
he
referred
to
john
--
mr.
benton
as
being
one
of
the
most
eminent
authorities
on
that.
if
we
pause
for
a
minute
and
read
the
language
of
the
amendment
that
mr.
benton
proposed
which
is
set
out
on
page
30,
in
the
footnote
of
the
commission's
brief.
it
says,
“no
gas
company
which
is
supplying
gas
to
a
public
utility
company
engaged
in
distributing
such
gas
to
the
public
shall
discontinue
service
to
such
public
utility
company
without
first
obtaining
from
the
commission
a
certificate
that
probably
convenient
and
necessity
permits
such
abandonment.
this
on
its
--
this
on
its
face,
doesn't
reach
a
--
a
sale
of
gas
by
a
producer
but
obviously
was
only
intended
to
relay
to
a
pipeline
providing
service
to
a
distributing
company.
i
might
point
out
in
that
connection
to
that
read
in
context,
mr.
benton
was
talking
about
7
(a).
and
as
i
pointed
out
before,
7
(a)
clearly,
and
the
commission
concedes,
does
not
apply
to
sales
by
a
producer.
in
urging
that
the
natural
gas
act
nevertheless
should
be
construed
as
imposing
such
a
broad
responsibility
upon
the
--
it
--
the
commissioner
asserts
that
this
is
necessary
in
order
to
protect
the
consumers.
this
argument
however
fails
to
give
any
effect
to
the
provision
of
section
1
(b)
exempting
from
the
commission
jurisdiction,
language
which
mr.
wahrenbrock
in
sun
oil,
were
characterized
as
irrelevant,
the
production
and
gathering
of
natural
gas.
section
1
(b),
it
has
an
affirmative
grant
of
jurisdiction
and
goes
on
to
exclude
from
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
among
those
items
excluded
from
the
commission's
jurisdiction
is
the
production
and
gathering
of
natural
gas.
this
exemption
as
this
court
has
already
recognized
in
panhandle
case
and
other
cases,
mobile
and
memphis,
reflects
a
congressional
reconciliation
of
the
interest
of
the
consumers
on
the
one
end
and
those
of
natural
gas
companies
on
the
other.
to
stress
as
the
commission
does
in
this
case,
a
need
for
an
indefinite
continuity
of
service
is
underway
to
the
consumer's
interest
and
results
of
invasion
of
a
production
in
gathering
exemption.
in
contrast,
we
believe
that
our
position
results
from
an
a
reasonable
accommodation
of
the
needs
and
legitimate
interest
of
both
the
producers
and
the
consumers
as
to
this
congress
had
intended.
mr.
melvin
richter
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
richter
because
we
--
that's
been
the
practice
of
sunray.
mr.
melvin
richter
yes,
sir.
right
--
sunray
has
from
the
outset
written,
make
sure
that
there
was
no
question
that
--
as
to
what
the
scope
of
certificate
there
were
applying
for.
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
i'm
not
(voice
overlap)
take
any
position
on
that
but
sunray
left
no
question
and
it's
cleared.
thus,
as
i
say,
the
position
that
we're
at
--
we're
just
taking
here
provides
in
reasonable
accommodation
of
the
interest
of
all
the
consumers
and
the
--
well,
natural
gas
company.
mr.
melvin
richter
no,
no.
we
say
the
commission
adopted
the
wrong
standards
and
--
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
we
say
--
we
--
we
--
mr.
melvin
richter
we
think,
that
the
--
we
are
--
are
--
application
for
a
basic
term
of
20
years
meets
the
standards,
that
should
be
applicable.
mr.
melvin
richter
if
they
can
--
mr.
melvin
richter
if
--
mr.
melvin
richter
presumably,
if
we
could
--
we
could
take
that
to
the
court
and
if
that's
not
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
by
the
commission.
we
would
be
forced
off
from
selling
the
gas.
mr.
melvin
richter
no.
not
at
--
at
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
i
think,
the
--
the
commission
qualified
the
--
the
wrong
standard,
that
they
assumed
that
there
was
a
presumption
and
that
--
that
the
certificates
should
be
of
definite
duration
and
that
on
special
circumstances
justify
this.
they
didn't
apply
the
right
standard
and
that
is
to
look
at
the
certificate
application
of
the
contract
for
a
term
of
20
years
and
look
at
that
and
say,
“does
this
meet
the
public
interest?”
they
didn't
do
that,
they
did
the
other
way
around.
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
then
--
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
they
haven't
undertaken
with
--
just
to
issue
any
--
give
any
reasons
why
they
think
they
--
while
there
is
a
presumption.
they
say
it's
a
statutory
--
they
read
into
the
statute
basically
and
they
don't
have
to
give
reasons
because
that's
what
the
law
provides
as
from
--
from
their
point
of
view.
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
just
make
one
more
point
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
remainder
of
my
time.
as
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
the
--
our
position
results
in
a
reasonable
accommodation
of
interest
of
both
the
consumer
and
the
producer,
on
the
one
hand,
the
20
years
gas
supply
of
gas
such
as
involved
here,
provides
to
the
consumer
a
highly
reasonable
assurance
of
continuity
of
service.
and
i
--
true,
this
is
not
a
supply
for
an
definite
period
but
it
barely
--
very
nearly
approximate
such
a
supply
as
far
as
the
needs
of
most
consumers
are
concerned.
the
commission
as
i
said,
has
never
insisted
upon
a
supply
for
longer
period
of
time
in
the
pipeline
cases
and
indeed
has
been
satisfied
with
very
much
less,
down
to
11
years.
on
the
other
hand,
the
producers,
we
think
have
the
legitimate
need,
periodically
to
reappraise
their
gas
commitments.
like
sunray,
most
producers
of
necessity
are
in
the
oil
business
as
well
as
in
the
natural
gas
business.
the
oil
business,
i
might
point
out,
is
not
federally
regulated.
this
is
so
because
frequently,
oil
and
natural
gas
are
produced
from
a
single
well
is
a
joint
product.
it's
result
of
geological
factor.
in
addition,
in
the
drilling
wells
of
new
fields,
it's
frequently
not
known
in
advance
what
of
anything
will
come
out
of
the
well.
now,
not
only
as
oil
and
gas
joint
products
but
they
are
competing
products
as
well
because
the
oil
is
used
for
feeding
typically
about
40%
of
the
production
of
crude
oil
that
goes
into
fuel
oil
and
natural
gas'
major
use
is
for
each
place
heating.
mr.
melvin
richter
no,
sir.
they've
turned
us
down
consistently.
we
have
other
cases
pending
in
court.
mr.
melvin
richter
oh,
they
have
in
long
sense,
in
some
pipe
line
cases,
not
in
the
producer
cases.
mr.
melvin
richter
but
they
originally
took
the
position,
i
might
say,
in
the
oil
sunray
case
for
instance,
they
had
no
authority
and
all
the
issuance
of
certificates
on
limited
duration.
then
sunray
took
them
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
had
authority
to
issue
certificates
to
limited
duration
and
sunray
and
--
then
when
came
up
to
this
court,
the
commission
then
confessed
that
they
had
made
a
mistake,
they
can
issue
a
certificates
to
limited
duration.
in
language,
which
if
i
would
have
time,
i
would
like
very
much
to
read
to
you.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
--
mr.
melvin
richter
--
for
rebuttal.
mr.
melvin
richter
well
--
mr.
melvin
richter
--
our
position
is
that
we
have
applied
for
a
certificate
for
20
years
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
contract.
that
under
section
7
(e)
of
the
natural
gas
act
that
the
--
we
have
--
which
provides
for
the
--
the
commissioner
to
consider
the
whole
or
grant
applications
as
a
whole
or
in
part,
that
the
entire
part
of
our
application,
the
entirety
of
our
application
is
for
a
certificate
for
20
years.
and
that
the
commission
here
denied
such
an
--
such
a
certificate
and
instead
gave
us
one
of
indefinite
duration.
we
go
on
and
say
further
that
section
7
(b)
is
inapplicable
here.
we
have
undertaken
in
our
--
we
are
--
we
will
provide
service
for
20
years
and
we
--
we
concede
that
section
7
(b)
does
apply
if
we
wanted
this
service
short
of
20
years.
but
at
the
end
of
the
20
years,
that
is
the
term
of
which
we
have
applied
for
and
we
are
--
that's
our
--
our
understanding
is
we
could
terminate
service.
mr.
melvin
richter
we
can
quit.
mr.
melvin
richter
that's
right.
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
that
won't
make
--
that's
just
there
for
--
mr.
melvin
richter
--
repetitive
language.
we
--
we
have
--
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
melvin
richter
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
melvin
richter
that's
right.
that
7
(b),
it's
--
well,
actually,
a
much
more
limited
provision
than
mr.
wahrenbrock
would
make
it
out
to
be.
in
this
connection,
i
would
--
mr.
melvin
richter
that's
right.
mr.
melvin
richter
yes.
i
--
i
won't
--
then
--
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
--
i
--
i'm
little
lost.
mr.
melvin
richter
that's
right.
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
we
concede
that
we
have
to
provide
service
during
--
mr.
melvin
richter
--
the
20
years
of
the
--
of
the
--
mr.
melvin
richter
--
certificate
that
we
have.
we
can't
discontinue
service
shy
of
the
20
years
--
mr.
melvin
richter
--
without
getting
commission
approval
under
section
7
(b).
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
we
say
section
7
(b)
is
not
applicable
here
at
all.
we
don't
--
we're
not
asking
for
advanced
authorization,
as
mr.
wahrenbrock
would
have
here
to
suggest,
to
discontinue
service
at
the
end
of
20
years.
we
are
here
under
section
7
(e)
of
the
act.
and
section
--
well,
that's
the
certificate
provision,
not
7
(b).
7
(b),
the
commission
--
i
may
quote
from
an
earlier
sunray
case
with
the
commission's
own
language,
“although
section
7
(b)
precludes
abandonment
of
service
rendered
by
facility
subject
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
without
compliance
to
procedures,
they
have
set
out.”
there
is
nothing
in
that
section
or
its
legislative
history
or
in
section
7
(e)
or
7
(c)
or
7
(e)
or
their
legislative
history,
to
require
a
ruling
that
section
7
(b),
in
anyway,
restricts
the
power
of
the
commission
under
section
7
(e)
and
7
(c)
to
issue
certificates
of
limited
duration.
mr.
melvin
richter
that's
in
a
memorandum
filed
by
the
commission
in
number
814,
october
10,
1956,
an
earlier
sunray
case.
mr.
melvin
richter
it's
in
acquiescing
--
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
may
i
go,
for
a
moment,
back
--
mr.
melvin
richter
no.
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
sir,
may
i
go
into
the
history
of
this
--
that
case
just
for
a
moment?
in
that
case,
the
--
that
was
the
first
sunray
case
in
which
the
commission
--
sunray
signed
a
certificate
of
limited
duration.
the
commission
in
that
case
held
flatly
that
they
had
no
authority
to
issue
a
certificate
of
unlimited
--
of
--
of
limited
duration.
they
said
7
(b)
precluded
them
from
doing
it.sunray
took
them
to
the
tenth
circuit
and
demonstrated,
beyond
any
doubt,
that
the
commission
had
in
the
past
been
issuing
certificates
of
limited
duration.
the
various
cases
they
now
cite
to
the
court
has
demonstrating
a
consistently
practice
on
the
matter.
the
tenth
circuit
went
ahead
and
held
that
the
commission
does
have
authority
to
issue
certificates
of
limited
duration
and
then
affirmed
the
commission's
order
on
other
grounds.
sunray
applied
for
certiorari
and
the
document
i
just
read
from
is
a
memorandum,
submitted
by
the
solicitor
general,
acquiescing
in
reversal
of
the
--
of
this
tenth
circuit's
opinion.
mr.
melvin
richter
no.
after
it's
--
it's
a
new
transaction
after
the
20
years.
mr.
melvin
richter
yes,
and
they
--
mr.
melvin
richter
and
a
time
that
mr.
wahrenbrock
has
just
painted
a
--
a
very
black
picture
about
the
discoveries
of
gas
and
how
at
the
end
of
the
20
years,
that
we
are
free
to
discontinue.
there'll
be
--
there'll
be
all
sorts
of
people
without
gas
and
how
bad
it'll
be
on
the
consumers.
yet
at
the
same
time,
yet
at
the
same
time,
as
recently
as
last
august,
august
10,
1959,
in
the
transwestern
pipeline
company
case,
the
commission
authorized
the
construction
and
operation
of
$192,000,000
project,
$192,000,000
project
whether
the
reserves
at
the
--
the
pipeline
could
show
it
only
for
13
years.
and
yet,
they're
complaining
here
when
we're
willing
to
commit
ourselves
for
20
years.
in
another
case,
in
the
truck
line
case,
issued
--
an
opinion
issued
on
may
22nd,
1959.
the
commission
granted
a
certificate
for
an
$80,000,000
project
with
the
--
the
reserves
that
they
could
show
was
a
maximum
of
13
years
and
a
minimum
of
11
and
a
half
years.
and
that's
not
--
i
--
those
aren't
isolated
instances.
on
pages
26
and
27
of
our
brief,
we
have
others,
with
the
commission
and
pipeline
cases.
although
they're
complaining,
they're
crying
here
how
gas
is
getting
scarcer
and
how
they
needed
an
indefinite
commitment
from
us
and
a
20-year
commitment
is
not
enough.
they're
issuing
in
pipeline
cases,
certificates
where
the
gas
supply
is
shown.
and
there's
no
obligation
on
the
pipeline
to
get
more
gas.
that's
a
voluntary
matter
so
far
as
the
pipeline
is
concerned.
well,
they're
issuing
certificates
where
the
gas
reserves
at
10,
12
years
of
duration.
thank
you
very
much,
sir.
