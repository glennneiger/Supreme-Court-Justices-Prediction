mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
in
the
few
minutes
that
remain
today,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
to
this
question
of
the
scope
of
the
commission's
action
here
whether
it
regarded
itself
as
bound
by
the
statute
not
to
do
this
or
whether
it
exercised
its
jurist
--
its
discretion
in
deciding
that
it
would
not
grant
a
limited
term
certificate.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
commission
has
not
been
granting
limited
term
certificates
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
permit
the
limitation
of
the
term.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
it
has
not
spelled
out
the
general
criteria.
in
the
pipeline
cases
in
which
it
has
granted
limited
terms
certificates
there
were
as
i
attempted
to
say
earlier,
special
circumstances
which
called
for
them,
or
conditions
which
--
which
created
an
--
an
--
a
clearly
temporary
need
for
gas
than
to
which
are
temporary
supply
was
given.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
as
indicated
by
the
results
and
only
as
indicated
by
the
results.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
it
has
not
--
in
here
or
any
place,
made
an
explicit
determination
were
bound
by
this
as
a
doctrine.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
but
looking
at
the
result,
it
has
required
in
every
case
that
there
be
a
showing
or
that
the
claim
of
a
right
to
stop
shall
have
a
support
the
effects
will
support.
and
the
commission
has
expressly
said
in
some
occasions
that
it
--
it
cannot
speculate
as
to
what
the
situation
will
be
20
years
hence
as
to
whether
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
will
then
permit.
that
it
can
now
look
at
the
need
for
gas
and
see
that
the
gas
is
need.
regarding
the
need
for
the
gas
as
now
existing,
it
authorizes
the
content
--
the
starting
of
the
service.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no,
sir.
in
the
one
that
was
--
just
our
argument
today?
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
there
was
a
10
year
contract
which
the
commission
--
but
the
commission
used
only
the
standard
language
which
it
had
used
here,
used
the
same
language
in
granting
this
certificate
as
it
used
in
the
sun
case.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
an
indefinite
term.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that
is
our
position.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
that
there
was
--
there
was
an
outstanding
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that
was
the
commission's
position
when
it
said
it
was
duplication
of
an
outstanding
certificate
which
was
of
indefinite
term.
it
used
the
same
language
there
as
it
used
here
where
there
was
before
it
a
specific
--
a
request
for
a
limited
term.
and
here,
the
finding
of
the
examiner
was
that
there
had
been
no
showing
in
support
of
the
request
for
that
limitation
on
term
which
would
warrant
the
--
would
warrant
a
finding
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
required
that.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
in
--
in
practically
every
case,
the
commission
has
an
outstanding
limited
term
contract
that,
i'd
say,
999
out
of
a
1000,
without
having
account
of
them.
so,
having
that
kind
of
a
contract
before
it,
it
has
always
issued
this
what
--
what
we
regard
or
we
argue
in
the
sun
case,
we
argue
here,
is
non-limited
term
certificate
and
which
is
here
treated
as
an
unlimited
term
certificate.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
may
(inaudible).
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
a
question
which
arouse
during
the
argument
of
these
two
federal
power
commission
certificate
cases
yesterday,
that
i
think
presents
a
good
point
of
departure.
and
that
is,
how
does
section
7
(b)
affect
the
commission's
certificating
power?
and
i
--
i
would
answer
that
further
by
saying
that
it
makes
clear
that
there
are
two
questions
for
the
commission
to
answer
in
considering
an
application
for
a
certificate
limited
to
the
term
of
the
contract.
the
first
question
is,
does
public
convenience
and
necessity
require
the
sale?
and
the
second
question
is,
does
public
convenience
and
necessity
permit
its
termination
at
the
end
of
the
contract?
there
was
evidence
in
this
sunray
case,
that
the
pipeline
united
needed
the
gas.
pipeline
sells
1,247,000,000,000
cubic
feet
of
gas
each
year.
to
maintain
its
reserves
of
gas,
it
has
to
acquire
additional
reserves
each
year
equal
in
amount
to
that,
that
it
sells
each
year.
this
gas
involved
in
these
contracts
represents
an
estimated
reserve
of
about
123,300,000,000
cubic
feet
and
that's
about
one-tenth
of
what
united
needs
each
year,
if
it's
to
keep
its
reserves
up
to
where
they
have
been.
now,
that
was
the
nature
of
the
evidence
that
was
in
this
record
as
to
the
need
for
the
gas,
need
for
the
sale.
but
what
was
the
evidence
as
to
the
--
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
would
require
or
permit
the
termination
of
the
sale?
was
there
any
evidence?
the
answer
is
substantially,
none.
the
examiner
described
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
on
that
point
and
he
summarized
that
in
the
--
in
the
following
language,
the
factual
accuracy
of
which
has
not
been
challenged.
he
said
that
it
might
fairly
be
summarized
by
saying
that
those
applicants
and
he
was
referring
to
sunray
and
another,
that
has
not
perfected
a
review
that
those
applicants
would
prefer
not
to
be
subject
to
regulation.
that
was
the
sum
and
substance
of
their
testimony.
but
the
commission
instead
of
denying
the
whole
package
because
there
had
not
been
any
evidentiary
showing
in
support
of
the
termination
of
the
sale,
which
it
could
have
done,
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
pointed
out
in
some
of
his
questions,
instead
of
doing
that
and
just
taking
a
negative
attitude
allowing
the
applicant
to
come
back
and
come
back
and
come
back
until
they
found
out
something
that
could
be
granted,
the
commission
said,
“we
will
grant
an
--
an
indefinite
term
certificate.”
and
it
granted
it.
meaning,
that
the
applicant
was
free
to
accept
it
or
not.under
the
commission's
regulation,
the
applicant
has
a
period
of
time
within
which
to
accept
the
certificate.
it
doesn't
have
to.
it
wasn't
compelled
to.
and
under
protest,
it
did
here,
under
protest,
in
reserving
its
right
to
question
this,
raise
this
question.
it
did
actually
accept
and
has
--
and
the
sale
has
started,
reserving
its
right
to
question.
and
the
commission
accepted
that
acceptance
or
acquiesced
in
that
acceptance
upon
the
specific
understanding
that
if
the
commission's
order
was
not
set
aside,
sunray
could
not
abandon
that
sale
at
any
time.
it
could
not
abandon
it
without
complying
with
7
(b).
so
that
gas
is
now
being
sold.
sunray
says
that
there
aren't
two
questions.
there's
only
one
question.
that
question
is,
if
we
understand
its
argument,
is
the
sale
required
by
public
convenience
and
necessity?
that
is,
is
it
required
for
whatever
term
the
applicant
has
contracted
and
proposes
in
its
application?
is
--
is
that
sale
required?
the
commission
says
that
the
sale
which
is
authorized
to
be
certificated
is
this
--
because
of
7
(b),
is
a
--
a
continuing
flow,
the
continuing
open-ended
selling
of
the
gas.
that's
--
that's
what
can
be
granted.
that's
what
is
applied
for.
that
was
--
is
what
must
be
considered
to
be
applied
for.
that
is
what
it
will
pass
on,
if
there
is
anything
more,
if
there
is
determination,
then
that
must
be
separately
passed
on
either
--
and
you
can
analyze
it
either
way
you
want
to
by
saying
that
it's
an
anticipation
of
the
7
(b)
permission
to
terminate,
or
you
can
say
that
it's
a
condition
which
the
commission
is
authorized
to
impose
under
section
7
(e),
the
terms
of
which
provide
that
the
commission
may
impose
any
conditions
it
finds
required
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
so,
in
the
commission's
point
of
view,
two
things
had
to
be
proved,
had
to
be
shown.only
one
was,
it
offered
the
kind
of
certificate
that
that
permitted.
now,
the
question
then
was
also
asked,
whether
what
difference
it
would
make
if
the
commission's
position
which
it
here
took
was
not
affirmed,
if
the
commission
could
not
do
what
it
purported
to
do
in
these
cases.
and
mr.
justice
black's
questions
about
the
procedural
disadvantages
to
rate
regulation
if
the
--
particularly,
if
a
shorter
term
contract
were
involved
and
particularly
if
it
got
down
to
one
that
could
be
terminated
on
30
days
notice,
the
impossibility
of
effectively
regulating
rates
and
particularly
even
in
middle
length
term
contracts
of
using
section
5
(a)
instead
of
4
(d)
with
its
more
effective
protection
to
consumers.
that's
--
that's
a
large
part
of
our
answer
to
the
question
of
what
difference
it
would
make.
but
beyond
that,
even
if
all
of
the
contracts
continued,
that
were
sought,
brought
before
the
commission,
continued
to
be
20-year
term
contracts,
even
if
mr.
richter
is
right
in
his
estimate
of
how
large
a
proportion
of
the
contracts
that
are
presently
under
certificate
are
20-year
contracts.
still,
the
20-year
contract
presents
a
very
serious
--
further
difficulty.
if
applicants
like
sunray
can
obtain
20-year
contracts,
limited
term
certificates,
under
such
circumstances
or
if
companies
like
sun
in
the
preceding
case
could
treat
their
indefinite
terms
certificates
for
10
or
20
years
as
limited
term
certificates,
it
would
mean
that
at
the
end
of
the
term,
they
do
not
have
to
comply
with
7
(b).
they've
already
received
their
authorization.
and
if
they
do
not
have
to
comply
with
7
(b)
at
that
type,
if
they
may
then
may
automatically
terminate,
that
means
that
their
purchaser,
their
pipeline
with
its
fixed
obligations
is
left
without
that
future
supply
of
gas,
what
gas
remains
there
until
those
reserves
have
been
completely
depleted.
a
natural
gas
is
an
exhaustible
resource,
of
course.
and
while
pipelines
are
growing,
new
discoveries
of
gas
are
not
increasing
as
rapidly
as
would
be
necessary
to
maintain
the
ratio
of
reserves
to
net
production.
and
a
continuance
of
the
trend
of
the
last
two
or
three
years
of
new
discoveries
in
relation
to
net
production
could
make
pipelines
hard
to
fill
long
before
the
end
of
20
years.
if
sunray
and
others
are
free
to
abandon
their
sales
such
as
this
to
united
from
the
--
from
the
production
properties
involved
here,
where
united
has
built
its
pipeline
in
to
take
the
gas,
united
will
have
to
go
out
into
the
market
and
compete
with
others
for
the
continuation
of
that
supply
or
for
a
substitution
for
that
supply
and
compete
in
a
market
which
is
bound
at
the
end
of
--
by
--
before
the
end
of
20
years
to
be
a
short-supply
market,
unless
we
cannot
rely
upon
present
trends.
that
market
will
include
sellers
who
are
free
of
federal
regulation
and
the
demand
for
gas
will
make
it
extremely
difficult
for
a
regulation
to
keep
prices
down.
capital
type
of
price
conditions
can
be
imposed
when
the
applications
are
brought
before
us.
but
if
the
sellers
can
sell
their
market
elsewhere
for
high
prices,
those
conditions
will
merely
drive
the
gas
out
of
the
interstate
market.
sunray's
arguments
in
this
case
with
amazing
frankness
tend
strongly
to
confirm
this.
for
sunray
frankly
espouses
its
business
interest,
its
legitimate
business
interest
as
it
calls
it,
its
business
interest
in
being
free
at
the
expiration
of
its
contract
term
to
reconsider
whether
it
will
continue
to
sell
its
gas.
it
is
scarcely
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
this
is
a
polite
way
of
saying
it
wants
to
be
free
to
use
its
economic
power
to
the
fullest.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
not
if
the
commission
is
wrong
in
the
position
it
took
here.
they
would
be
completely
free
if
--
if
sunray
can
abandon
at
the
termination
of
its
contract,
then
sunray
is
completely
free
to
sell
in
intrastate
commerce
without
the
let
or
leave
of
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
means
until
they
can
get
7
(b)
permission
and
the
two
criteria,
the
alternative
criteria
for
giving
them
7
(b)
permission
to
abandon
--
are
--
the
two
criteria
are.
first,
that
the
available
supply
of
gas
has
become
depleted.
and
second
or
alternatively,
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
permit
the
abandonment.
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
them
under
the
commission's
theory
from
coming
in
a
year
or
20
or
50
years
later
in
asking
for
permission
under
those
circumstances,
if
they
can
make
either
of
those
showings.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
not
to
sell
the
same
gas,
of
course,
but
they
could
sell
different
quantities
from
the
same
field
certainly,
certainly.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i'm
--
i'm
glad
to
understand
what
was
--
it's
--
it
is
the
continuance
of
the
kind
of
sale
that
is
being
made,
the
continuance
of
that
sale
in
this
place
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
gas
that
can
be
produced
from
the
acreage
that
is
here
involved,
from
that
acreage.
this
contract
was
to
sell
the
gas
that
could
be
produced
from
that
acreage.
now,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
be
held
to
all
of
these
because
of
the
complicated
definition,
but
whatever
the
definition
of
gas
being
sold,
it's
that
sale
which
is
committed
and
not
whatever
else
they
may
have
elsewhere.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
certainly,
take
the
--
the
simplest
kind
of
--
of
a
contract
that
i
can
think
of
at
the
spur
of
the
moment.
a
producer
says,
“i'll
sell
you
10,000
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day
or
hour,”
whatever
it
is.
that's
all
that's
committed
to
interstate
commerce.
he
can
sell
it
to
somebody
else
out
of
the
same
well,
10,000
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day
or
hour,
whatever
it
is.
nothing
to
prevent.
it's
the
gas
which
he
has
contracted
to
sell,
that
sale
which
is
committed
to
the
public
service.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that
the
commission
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
public
has
become
dependent
upon
that
supply.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
7
--
7
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
section
7
(b)
which
says
that
no
facilities
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
or
service
rendered
by
means
thereof
shall
be
abandoned
without
having
first
obtained
the
commission's
permission
and
approval.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
exactly.
and
even
if
gas
could
be
bought
at
the
same
price,
that
would
mean
that
the
pipelines
that
have
been
laid
to
take
that
gas
represent
a
waste
investment.
and
that
was
--
the
basis
of
judge
mclaughlin's
statement
in
the
huber
case,
which
we
quote
in
our
brief
in
which
he
points
out
the
--
the
losses
that
would
be
involved
in
that
duplication
of
facilities
and
the
pipeline
having
to
go
elsewhere
to
get
a
supply
to
continue
to
carry
its
public
utility.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
i
think
that
7
(b)
represents
the
apex
of
that
--
the
implementation
of
that
policy.
we
think
that
policy
is
consistent
with
the
policy
declaration
in
section
1
(a)
and
with
the
--
the
provisions
of
section
1
(b)
which
state
what
is
subject
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction,
both
of
which
make
the
regulation
dependent
upon
and
applied
to
the
sale,
for
resale,
for
ultimate
distribution
to
the
public.
it
is
that
concept
of
the
ultimate
use
that's
being
made
of
the
gas
that
seems
to
inform
the
general
provisions
and
the
specific
provision
about
not
abandoning
service.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that
--
that
is
what
i
was
attempting
to
suggest
earlier
in
my
argument
when
i
said
it's
this
usual
utility,
public
utility
concept
of
dedication
to
the
public
service.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
if
they
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
there
is
nothing
so
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
there
is
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
prohibits
abandonment.
they
may
still
have
some
contractual
questions.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no.
that's
why
this
issuance
of
a
--
of
a
certificate
does
not
mean
that
it
--
so
far
as
the
power
commission
may
not
be
abandoned.
that
question
is
not
foreclosed
one
way
or
the
other.
now,
that
question
is
open
and
remains
open.
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
in
this.
that
if
the
commission
were
to
grant
a
limited
term
certificate
as
claimed
by
our
opponent,
then
that
would
carry
with
it,
that's
what
they
claimed,
the
--
the
right
to
abandon
without
having
to
comply
with
7
(b)
at
the
end.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
we
--
we
may
not
have
to
but
we
do
regard,
if
we
grant
a
limited
term
certificate,
it
carries
with
it
the
right
to
terminate.
the
finding
is
the
same,
we
feel,
in
either
case.
if
we're
going
to
grant
a
limited
term
certificate,
we
have
to
find
first
that
the
sale
is
necessary.
second,
that
its
termination
is
permitted
by
the
public
convenience
and
the
necessity
which
to
say
that
you've
already
made
the
finding
which
7
(b)
would
have
required
in
any
event.
so,
you've
already
committed
yourself
in
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
tried
[laughs]
--
express
that
in
terms
of
--
that's
been
perhaps
the
net
effect
of
what
the
commission
has
been
doing.
but
in
each
case,
the
commission
has
not
excluded
evidence
as
permitted
evidence
that
would
show
that
the
termination
at
the
time
requested,
20
years,
10
years
that
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
because
the
burden
is
on
the
applicant
who
seeks
an
authorization,
and
this
is
a
dual
authorization,
to
make
the
sale
and
to
stop
the
sale.
the
burden
is
on
--
upon
an
applicant
who
seeks
such
authorization
to
support
it
to
the
extent
of
showing
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
require
the
sale
and
the
termination.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
don't
see
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
--
i
cannot
accept
the
imputation
of
a
--
of
a
doctrine
or
a
necessity
for
a
special
showing.
there's
no
--
there's
nothing
more
than
there
is
in
--
in
the
case
of
any
other
authorization
that
is
being
sought
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no,
i'm
--
i'm
not
trying
to
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
suppose
i'm
missing
something
in
the
language
between
this
because
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
commission
recognizes
that
if
it
grants
a
limited
term
certificate
now,
it
will
be
deciding
now
that
the
service
may
be
abandoned
20
years
hence.
hence,
it
should
have
the
showing
now,
which
it
would
otherwise
get
20
years
hence.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
they
cannot
divest
themselves,
except
by
a
finding
at
the
--
either
at
the
time
they
want
to
terminate
or
a
finding
in
advance
if
they
want
it
now,
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
will
permit
that
abandonment.
let's
--
we
leave
out
depletion
for
the
moment.
public
convenience
and
necessity
will
permit
that
abandonment.
if
they
want
it
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right
but
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right,
but
--
but
we
must
give
them
that
permission,
if
they
showed
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
permit
it.
and
it
is
only
that
which
we
may
--
whether
we
consider
it
then
or
now
may
use
as
a
basis
for
granting
that
permission.
if
we
grant
it
now,
we
grant
it
without
having
enough
facts
to
really
know
if
we
wait
and
we
say,
“we
don't
have
enough
facts.
you
haven't
made
the
showing
now,”
and
that's
what
most
of
these
cases
are,
you
haven't
made
the
showing,
but
that's
--
you're
still
free
to
come
in
at
the
end
of
your
term
or
anytime
during
your
term
and
say,
“now,
you
can
show
it.”
“all
right,
if
you
can
show
it
then
you
get
it.”
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
if
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
if
at
the
time
the
application
were
filed,
they
were
asking
for,
as
sunray
clearly
is,
a
limited
term
certificate
to
expire
at
a
given
date
and
the
commission
granted
it,
which
it
refused
to
do
here,
then
at
that
time,
that
date
arrived,
they
would
be
free
to
stop
selling
without
getting
any
further
permission
or
approval.
they've
already
gotten
that
permission.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
say,
if
your
honor,
please.
and
that's
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
the
reason
i
came
back
to
this
question
because
i
felt
i've
left
that
obscure
and
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
because
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
from
our
right
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
it
cuts
us
off
at
the
end
of
20
years
from
our
power
to
say,
“you've
got
to
get
our
approval
now
before
you
can
stop.”
you
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
exactly.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
now,
does
that
leave
me
[laughs]
not
in
the
clear
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
i'm
afraid
from
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
some
of
your
questions
of
opposing
counsel
but
i
--
that
i
created
a
misapprehension,
and
i'm
sorry.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that
much
is
true.
yes,
sir.
that
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
by
--
they
can,
sir,
by
--
if
your
honor,
please.
they
can
do
it
by
making
and
showing
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
permits.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
but
without
such
a
showing,
they
cannot
--
never
quit
and
yet
if
we
had
granted
a
limited
term
certificate,
they
could.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
because
we
feel
that
when
you
have
--
we
have
authorized
a
sale
for
20
years
and
its
stoppage
at
end
of
20
years,
we
have
thereby
authorized
its
stoppage.
and
when
we've
authorized
its
stoppage,
we've
done
just
what
7
(b)
would
have
required
them
to
come
in
then,
but
we
have
freed
them
from
the
necessity
of
doing
so.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
because
that
is
what
they
explicitly
asked
for
by
the
question
--
by
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
may
i
just,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
call
attention
to
page
2
of
our
brief.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
where
we
quote
the
language
from
the
application
which
sunray
filed
here
and
should
have
done
this
earlier,
obviously.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
page
2
of
our
brief,
on
the
--
the
top
of
the
page
is
a
question
presented.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
is
a
quotation
from
the
application.
the
application
requested
a
certificate
authorizing
the
sale
of
gas
covered
by
the
contract,
“to
the
extent
and
only
to
the
extent
that
such
gas
is
transported
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale
for
the
remainder
of
the
term
of
said
contract
and
as
it
may
be
renewed
or
extended.
and
that
said
certificate
provide
for
its
own
expiration
on
the
expiration
of
the
said
contract
term
so
as
to
authorize
applicant
to
seize
the
delivery
and
sale
of
gas
thereunder
at
that
time.”
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
big
thing
becomes
less
clear
until
you
get
back
to
the
kind
of
an
application
which
was
filed
by
sun,
in
the
first
case,
which
they
are
now
attempting
to
say,
did
ask
for
just
what
this
explicitly
asked
for.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
think
not,
for
this
reason.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
suggested
that
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
maybe
so.[laughs]
i'm
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
so.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that
may
--
it
--
it
sounds
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
it
sounds
so.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
sounds
so.[laughs]
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
pardon?
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
there
is
--
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
it
that
prevents
that
language
i
read
to
you
from
being
analyzed
as
being
a
request
now
under
7
(b)
for
termination
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
20
years
in
advance.
and
if
we
did
not
make
it
explicit
that
we
were
denying
it,
it
might
be
construed
as
being
that.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
that
is
what
we
did.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
what
they
applied.
that's
what
they
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
what
they
applied
for
and
that's
what
we
refused
to
gave
them
--
gave
them
and
said,
“you
can
have
a
certificate
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
but
it's
an
unlimited
term.”
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
and
by
whatever
rubric
you
describe
it
or
whatever
analysis
you
reach
that
and
so.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
--
i
think
that
is
another
way
of
describing
what
we
did
do.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right
and
we
say
we
did
not
do
it
then,
that
they
didn't
really
ask
us
for
it
there.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
exactly.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
exactly,
but
we
felt
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
now,
let
me
say
this
reason
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
for
granting
the
certificate
that
we
did.
these
people
had
gas.
they
wanted
to
sell
it.
it
was
a
newly
developed
field.
i
don't
know
whether
there
might
have
been
leakage
or
drainage,
if
they
hadn't
enough.
so
the
commission
gave
them
what
it
thought
it
could
and
they
went
ahead
and
acted
under
it.
thank
you.
