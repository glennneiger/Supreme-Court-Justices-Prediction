justice
hugo

your
idea
is,
as
i
gather,
is
--
is
the
commission
or
statute
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
gives
the
--
the
statute
gives
that
power
in
order
to
provide
for
stability
to
the
interstate
people
who
have
bought
the
gas
and
then
otherwise,
they're
likely
completely
cut
off.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now,
that's
--
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
good
argument
so
far
as
the
merits
of
it
is
concerned.
i'm
sure.
what
is
the
basis
of
it
in
the
statute
that
authorize
it,
from
your
standpoint
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.

and,
of
course,
if
after
10
years,
the
local
demand
should
become
such
that
they
could
withdraw
all
that
was
then
in
interstate
commerce,
i
presume
that
people
who
had
--
industries
and
the
people
who
are
dependent
on
gas,
through
interstate
commerce,
would
be
left
with
pipelines
with
no
gas
to
feed
the
--
feed
the
customers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
depend
entirely
on
7
(b)
or
do
you
depend
at
all
on
the
general
plan
and
purpose
of
the
act
to
provide
for
continuity
of
service
at
reasonable
rates
in
the
interstate
commerce?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
same
argument
you're
making,
of
course,
i
don't
know
whether
it
fits
this
statute.
it's
the
same
type
of
argument
that
has
been
made
in
connection
with
street
railway
service,
bus
service,
railroad
service
and
other
public
utility
services
where
the
--
the
matter
is
taken
over
under
regulations
by
the
government.
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
grant
them
the
kind
of
certificate
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
a
little
confused
now
by
the
question
of
justice
frankfurter
and
your
answer.
if
you
--
i
understood
that
they
wanted
the
right
or
limited
terms
squared
on
the
theory
that
when
that
was
over
with,
you
could
not
compel
them
to
continue.
they
would
have
fully
performed
their
agreement
upon
the
basis
on
which
you
permitted
them
to
have
the
services
to
make
this
contract
temporary
in
nature.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
is
it
your
idea
that
at
the
end
of
the
20
years,
that
they
might
--
what
their
position
they
are
holding,
might
be
held
to
be
the
correct
one
under
the
statute?
that
if
you
grant
them
that
limited
term
right,
they
own
this
contract.
and
when
they
get
through,
they
can
say,
â€œwell,
now,
we're
not
going
to
let
you
--
you
don't
have
any
more
unless
you
accept
the
contract
that
if
we
won't
pay
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
in
the
public
interest.
is
that
your
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
--
maybe
i
--
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
but
i
want
to
get
counted
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
i
don't
know
if
there's
any
disagreement
between
you.
you're
taking
the
position
that
you
do
have
the
right
under
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
clause
to
pass
at
the
beginning
on
whether
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
justifies
the
making
of
the
contract
the
--
and
the
service
in
which
they
are
entering.
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
when
people
apply
on
the
basis
of
public
convenience
and
necessity,
it's
up
to
them
to
show
you
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
requires
what
they
ask.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
careful,
at
least,
maybe
i'm
wrong,
maybe
that's
wrong,
that
if
having
decided
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
justifies
you
in
giving
them
the
right
to
operate
for
20
years
only
that
that
cuts
you
off
thereafter
from
your
right
to
claim
an
abandon
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
--
or
to
prevent
an
abandonment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
are
careful
that
it
will
be
held
that
your
action
then
finally
and
irrevocably
settles
that
--
that
public
necessity
question
so
that
they
can
quit
if
they
want
to.

justice

if
that
were
held,
that
would
solve
your
problem,
as
i
understand
it,
would
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
were
held,
as
to
justice
frankfurter's
suggestion,
that
you
can't
give
them
a
certificate
that
deprives
of
the
right
to

to
--
justice

to
prevent
abandonment.
why
wouldn't
that
get
precisely
what
you've
been
arguing
for
although
it
might
not
reach
it
by
the
exact
formula

you
have
devised?[laughter]
justice

it
seems
to
me,
i

i
may
be

now,
as
i
understand

other
side
do
exist.
they
will
have
the
right
to
abandon,
notwithstanding
number
7
under
--
under
an
application
of
this
kind
which
is
approved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
--
what
you
believe
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
construe
it
as
being
an
application
for
a
20-year
franchise
to
serve
the
public
in
interstate
gas
with
the
understanding
between
you
and
the
--
and
them.
at
the
end
of
that
time,
they
have
no
more
obligation
and
they
can
quit
when
they
get
ready.
is
that
what
you're
(voice

--
justice
hugo

that's
what
they
are
insisting.
justice
hugo

you're
claiming

you're
claiming

for
whatever
reason
that

mr.
richter,
would
you
mind
stating
at
the
beginning
whether
the
position
he
attributes
to
you
in
connection
with
this
application
as
to
its
effect
--
justice

--
is
correct
or
not?
justice

you
can
quit?

go
on

not

you
choose.
