justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
was
that,
mr.
richter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
20
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
was
this,
mr.
richter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
based
on
a
general
rule
by
the
commission
or
regarding
the
specific
circumstances
presented
by
your
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
i
indicated
that
the
commission
has
the
power
of
not
being
bound
by
a
specific
contract,
indicate
that
to
my
ignorance,
he
seem
to
not
welcome
that
suggestion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
thought
--
as
you
thought
i
--
as
i
gather
from
you,
that's
what
the
commission
did
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
but
the
commission
here
said,
we
don't
--
we
don't
want
a
term
contract
--
a
term
certificate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we'll
give
you
indefinite
certificate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
that
--
this
is
my
talent,
has
come
within
but
i
got
the
impression
that
he
was
not
welcome
to
that
suggestion
when
i
made
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
i
do
it
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
the
--
suppose
they
set
forth
what
they
haven't
set
froth,
i
take
it,
reasons
of
the
inadvisability
of
trying
himself
without
perfect
experience.
suppose
they
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
not
this
[inaudible]
of
things
whatever
it
is,
35
whatever
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
granted
ad
hoc
with
reference
to
the
particular
situation
or
as
a
general
guiding
principal
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
were
the
criteria
for
determining
whether
the
public
interest
does?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
even
as
the
pipeline
didn't
have
a
general
quality
against
term
grant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
as
an
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
explicit
declaration
of
its
doctrine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
done
but
just
this
will
guide
us
and
will
guide
everybody
to
be
equally
treated
like
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
the
sun
oil
case,
there
was
a
term
certificate,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
is
there
a
10-year
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
in
response
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
for
the
new
contract,
there's
no
need
of
asking
for
a
certificate
on
--
is
there?
in
the
sun
case.
if
it's
an
undefined
and
none
determinable
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
there
couldn't
be
but
there
--
that
to
give
the
certificate.
why
do
you
come
us
if
you
still
have
a
certificate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
sun
case,
you
also
had
an
outstanding
10-year
contract.
i
suppose
people
would
assume
that
the
certificate
will
last
as
long
as
the
contract
was
operated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
might
say
i
don't
quite
understand
because
the
power
to
--
the
requirement
or
the
--
the
considerations
for
securing
an
abandonment
within
the
desired
20
years
isn't
shut
off
because
they
have
a
certificate
for
20
years,
is
it?
what's
the
bar
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
bar
abandonment
within
20
years
if
that's
what
the
commission
thinks
is
desirable
or
publicly
important
although
they
gave
it
for
20
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
same
section
that
you
rely
on
allowing
abandonment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
not
your
concern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
bears
on
the
argument
that
they
can
grant
a
certificate
for
20
years.
if
your
argument
is
that
this
cuts
in
to
the
power
of
the
--
the
public
interest
in
securing
abandonment
within
the
20
years,
i
don't
follow
the
argument,
if
that's
your
argument.
that
you
say
this
all
derives
from
the
--
the
section
7
relating
to
abandonment.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
don't
have
to
yield
to
that
argument
in
order
to
yield
with
the
other
part
of
the
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that
--
that
i
quite
appreciate
that
you
may
find
as
a
fact
in
a
particular
situation,
the
public
interest
does
not
recommend
or
make
desirable
a
20-year
certificate.
i
understand
that,
but
that
isn't
the
position
of
the
commission.
as
i
understand
it,
your
position
is
that
you
will
not,
as
a
matter
of
rule,
grant
a
term
firmly,
unless
some
very
special
consideration
is
shown
in
a
particular
case
or
do
i
misconceive
your
argument,
what
you
told
us
yesterday?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
if
they
ask
of
the
applicant
has
to
show.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
therefore,
the
starting
point,
the
--
the
postulate
with
which
the
controversy
begins
is
that
you
will
not
grant
it.
and
that
must
presuppose
some
rule
of
policy
by
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you
--
but
implied
in
this
case
is
a
doctrine
by
you
or
a
rule
by
the
commission
that,
we
will
not
grant
this
application
for
20
years
unless
you
show
us
some
special
consideration.
and
therefore,
i
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
real
question
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
is
whether
you
have
the
right
under
that
statute
to
make
such
a
rule
when
the
statute
doesn't
make
such
a
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
that
you
discriminated
against
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
particular
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
applicant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
was
no
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
meant
to
say
is
that
as
i
understand
this,
if
a
commission
says
when
a
fellow
applies
to
his
certificate,
show
us
a
good
reason
why
it
should
be
20
years
that
that
presupposes
a
general
doctrine
or
general
rule
or
general
practice,
call
it
what
you
will,
by
the
commission
not
to
grant
a
term
certificate.
how
can
it
be
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
intend
to
interrupt.
why
does
it
imply
that
if
you
say
the
law
disallows
them
to
abandon,
no
matter
what
the
term
is,
as
the
previous
case
indicates.
no
matter
what
the
new
contract
is.
they
cannot
divest
themselves
of
the
dedication
which
they
undertook
when
they
got
a
certificate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
says
they
can't
abandon
it
unless
you
--
their
undertaking,
unless
you
give
them
permission,
at
any
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
it
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
i
mean
--
i
don't
understand
that
in
light
of
your
yesterday's
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
--
i
thought
that
your
argument
was
that
section
7
involves
a
dedication
not
limited
in
time
or
not
dependent
on
the
voluntary
determination
of
the
certificate
holder.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
once
he
embarks
upon
supplying
natural
gas,
you've
got
to
stick
to
it
unless
the
commission,
no
matter
his
arrangement
is
--
what
is
--
either
see
arrangement
with
the
producer
or
with
the
--
that
he
is
--
he
must
continue
in
the
enterprise
of
furnishing
gas
unless
he
gets
leave
of
the
commission
to
say
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
why
doesn't
that
answer
justice
black's
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
quite
true.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
what
was
--
what
you
agreed
to
but
it
--
i
must
--
i
must
disabuse
my
mind
of
what
i
heard
all
day
yesterday
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that
the
statute,
the
statute
created
an
obligation
which
is
not
terminable
by
the
free
act
of
the
parties
no
matter
what
agreement
they've
entered
into
or
what
the
terms
of
the
certificate
under
which
they
were
operating.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that
much
is
true,
then
they
--
then
they
can't
cut
off
at
--
at
the
end
of
20
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
they
can
do
that,
they
can
always
come
to
you
and
ask
you
to
abandon
at
any
time
that
the
public
convenience
necessity
permits
or
requires
--
suggest
or
makes
desirable
that
they
should
quit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
where
i
--
all
right.
i've
--
i've
had
my
--
i
don't
seem
to
understand
that.
i
do
not
understand
why,
if
by
statute,
they
must
go
on
whether
they've
got
20
years
or
indefinite
years
unless
you
give
them
permission
to
quit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
can
understand
that.
does
that
mean
that
if
you
--
if
you
grant
a
20-year
certificate,
you
impliedly
authorize
a
prospective
abandonment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
that?
that
what
is
english
language
means
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
--
that's
a
--
then
i
have
misunderstood
the
case
and
the
fault
is
all
mine.
i
didn't
understand
that
they
said,
“you
give
us
a
20-year
certificate
and
by
so
doing,
we
now
ask
you
to
let
us
quit
at
the
end
of
20
years.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
that
last
clause
were
omitted,
would
the
nature
of
the
case
before
us
change?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
say
--
i
have
a
further
problem
with
these
provisions,
chief
justice's
permission,
that
if
the
statute
--
section
7
reads
as
you
read
it,
then
i
think
no
agreement
between
the
commission
and
parties
can
change
the
obligation
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
require
abandonment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
that
makes
this
a
particular
case.
they
have
not
raised
all
the
general
questions
but
most
of
the
times,
you've
been
talking
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
say
that
the
question
isn't
before
us,
if
they
do
not
imply
the
--
if
by
granting
their
request
you
thereby
give
away
their
duty
to
go
on
at
the
end
of
20
years
if
that's
allowable
under
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
suggestion
is
if
i
were
on
the
commission,
i
would
say
i'd
grant
the
certificate
but
cut
off
the
last
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
you
haven't
taken
care
of
my
--
or
attend
my
third,
my
(inaudible),
namely,
“yes,
i'll
grant
it
you
for
20
years
but
i'll
cut
off
the
provision
and
the
certificate.
at
the
end
of
20
years,
you
can
quit”.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
take
care
of
that
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
have
to
do
that
in
the
other
case,
would
you,
because
they
didn't
apply
for
it?
they
are
claiming
that
without
a
--
without
that
language,
they're
entitled
to
get
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
this
case
should
be
decided
that
by
saying,
the
certificate,
as
it
was
asked,
both
for
20
years
and
for
a
committed
abandonment
at
the
end
of
20
years,
was
properly
disallowed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
just
at
that?
let
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
take
care
of
the
situation
i
put
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
right
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
--
suppose
the
--
the
last
clause,
that
--
the
one
we've
read,
the
one
we've
read
on
page
2
or
3
of
his
brief
were
out
to
the
extent
and
only
to
the
extent
that
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
that
if
you
were
granted
a
certificate
for
20
years,
nothing
is
said
about
expiration,
but
that
by
a
force
of
the
limitation
of
20
years,
you
could
quit
at
the
end
of
20
years
and
not
require
and
it
would
not
entail
an
abandonment
proceeding
under
7?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
say
that
7,
that
are
not
made,
make
it
a
continuous
duty
once
you've
begun
to
go
on
until
you
get
permission
to
stop.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
that
turns
on
what
7
(b)
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
he
is
right
that
7
(b)
means
that
you
can't
quit,
except
by
leave
of
the
commission.
suppose
it
means
that.
then
it
might
make
a
difference
whether
the
certificate
is
granted,
allowing
quitting
at
the
expiration
of
20
years
or
not
allowing
quitting,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
construe
7
(b)
not
the
way
he
construed
it,
the
commission
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
construe
it,
the
duty
to
go
on
no
matter
what
the
term
under
which
you
hold.
justice
felix
frankfurter
during
the
term.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
after
20
years,
you
disagree
with
the
construction
of
7
(b)
by
the
commission.
that
7
(b)
disallows
abandonment
by
certificate
holder
at
any
time
no
matter
what
period,
definite
or
indefinite,
he's
operating
under,
without
leave
of
the
commission.
you
contest
that
reading
of
7
(b).
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
this
is
an
argument
they
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
myself
take
(inaudible)
what
lawyers
constantly
do
here,
dig
out
some
old
brief
by
--
when
--
an
opposing
side,
when
it
suited
him
to
make
an
ad
hoc
argument
one
way
as
against
what
they
make
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that's,
myself,
very
bad
professional
practice,
if
you
want
to
know
that.
