justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
born
of
curiosity?
why
did
you
go
to
the
precaution
of
applying
for
a
limited
certificate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
you
don't
think
it's
as
clear
as
you
have
here
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
the
commission
given
you
other
limited
certificates
in
other
instances?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
have
no
right
to
continue
after
the
expiration
of
your
certificate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
what
if
the
commission
is
saying
in
effect,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
in
order
to
keep
you
in
the
business
under
section
7
(b),
they
must
give
you
an
unlimited
certificate
so
that
they
can
prevent
your
getting
out
of
the
business
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
at
any
time
in
the
future?
