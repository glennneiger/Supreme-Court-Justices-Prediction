mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
set
in
the
factual
posture
of
this
case,
the
precise
basis
of
the
department's
decision,
recommendation
to
the
appeal
board.
as
we
think
that
most
of
the
procedural
issues
to
which
mr.
covington
has
just
adverted,
in
fact,
do
not
properly
presented
by
the
factual
posture
of
this
case.
now,
the
recommendation
of
the
department,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
that
under
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
what
the
department
tells
to
the
appeal
board
is
only
a
recommendation.
the
appeal
board
specifically
is
authorized
either
to
follow
it
or
to
object
it.
the
department's
recommendation
in
this
case
is
set
forth
at
page
177
of
the
record.
in
that
recommendation,
after
the
chief
of
the
conscientious-objector
section
for
the
department
summarizes
the
report
of
the
hearing
officer,
summarizes
the
material
in
the
résumé.
he
concludes
that
the
hearing
officer
reported
that
the
registrant
gave
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
page
176
and
177.
i'm
first
referring
to
page
176
which
summarizes
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
examiner.
and
the
hearing
examiner
had
concluded
that
although
the
registrant
gave
every
appearance
of
being
sincere,
he
did
not
believe
he
was
sincerely
opposed
to
any
participation
in
military
service
but
only
to
participation
in
combat
service.
the
department
recommendation
said
they
didn't
think
they
--
that
could
be
sustained
on
this
record
but
then,
they
went
on,
page
177
and
stated
as
follows,
“on
the
other
hand,
the
registrant's
claim
as
to
the
amount
of
his
religious
activities
is
so
highly
exaggerated.
if
we
are
to
believe
the
official
records
of
his
religious
organization
as
reported
in
the
résumé
and
recapitulated
above
as
to
cast
doubt
upon
his
veracity
and
consequently
upon
his
sincerity
and
good
faith.”
now,
that
conclusion
rests
on
a
report
in
the
registrant's
draft
file
made
by
the
local
board
just
after
he
had
appeared
before
the
local
board
at
his
interview
in
1956.
that
report
is
set
forth
at
page
173
of
the
record.
that
report
stated
that
the
petitioner
had
told
the
local
board
at
the
interview
that
he
was
then
devoting
100
hours
a
month
to
preaching
as
a
pioneer
and
an
additional
50
to
75
hours
a
month
in
other
religious
activities.
now,
it
is
not
disputed
that
at
the
time
this
incident
took
place,
the
petitioner
was
only
devoting
six
and
one-half
hours
a
month
to
his
preaching.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
that
was
set
forth
in
the
first
résumé,
mr.
justice
douglas.
there
were
two
proceedings.
he
went
through
the
appeal
proceedings
twice.
and
he,
himself,
conceded
at
his
trial
that
at
that
time,
he
was
only
devoting
six
and
a
half
hours
a
month
to
preaching.
the
fact
is
that
he
only
spent
six
months
in
the
so-called
“pioneer
status”
as
devoting
100
hours
a
month
to
preaching.
after
six
months,
he
gave
up
his
full-time
ministry.
now,
the
petitioner
has
not
denied
at
any
point
in
this
proceeding,
even
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
or
before
this
court,
that
a
misstatement
of
this
character,
if
it
had
been
made
before
the
local
board,
warranted
the
denial
of
his
claim
to
conscientious
objector
status.
in
other
words,
he
does
not
contest
that
if,
at
the
time
he
claimed
to
be
devoting
100
hours
a
month
to
religious
preaching,
he
was
only
devoting
six
and
a
half
hours
a
month,
that
misstatement
warranted
the
local
board
and
the
appeal
board
in
denying
his
claim.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
claims
he
never
made
the
statement,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
only
evidence,
mr.
justice,
is
in
the
report
of
the
draft
board
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
the
item
at
page
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
well,
this
is
only
evidence
that
he
made
the
statement
in
1
--
in
record
173.
but
we
think
there
is
additional
evidence
which
supports
the
validity
of
this
statement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
have
to
have
three
answers
to
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
first
place,
the
statement
begins
with
the
word
“mr.
gonzales
stated”.
in
other
words,
before
the
language
of
the
previous
letters
included,
it
has
the
word
“mr.
gonzales
stated”.
now,
we
don't
know
what
happened
at
the
draft
board
but
we
do
know
that
this
statement
was
a
record
which
the
draft
board
was
authorized
to
make
because
under
the
regulations,
only
written
material
maybe
relied
on
as
the
basis
for
classification.
now,
perhaps,
this
was
read
at
the
draft
board,
perhaps,
it
was
incorporated
but
we
think
the
real
answer
is
what
is
set
forth
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
issue
at
page
190
of
the
record.
and
they
say
as
follows,
at
the
top
of
the
page,
“even
if
we
assume
that
the
board
copied
the
fourth
paragraph
of
appellant's
letter
of
november
22nd,
it
would
not
impeach
its
record
if,
in
fact,
he
told
the
board
substantially
the
same
thing
he
stated
in
his
letter
of
november
22nd.”
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
just
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
there
is
no
testimony
he
denied
it.
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
trial
court,
who
heard
this
testimony,
concluded
that,
in
fact,
his
testimony
did
not
outweigh
the
official
records.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
his
trial
in
this
case,
petitioner
took
the
stand
and
denied
that
he
had
made
these
statements
before
the
local
board
as
to
the
amount
of
time
devoted
to
his
preaching.
the
trial
court
which
had
the
opportunity
to
observe
misdemeanor
on
the
stand,
nevertheless
concluded
and
this
is
at
page
91
--
i'm
sorry,
115
of
the
record.
trial
court
said
that
although
petitioner
denied
having
made
these
statements,
the
board's
summary.
“probably,
fairly
reflect
what
took
place
at
this
time.”
and
similarly
the
court
of
appeals
in
passing
on
this
contention
said
that
the
record
had
support
for
the
conclusion
that
petitioner
had
been
guilty
of
gross
misrepresentation
of
his
ministerial
status
of
the
hearing
before
the
local
board.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
this
was
the
official
record
of
the
board.
this
was
a
record
that
the
board
was
authorized
to
make.
he
had
adequate
opportunity
to
correct
any
misstatements
in
his
file,
to
complain
about
this.
he
emphasizes
that
he
did
not
see
this
particular
statement
until
just
before
his
trial.
well,
eight
months
elapsed
between
the
time
that
he
appeared
before
the
local
board
and
that
he
received
the
copy
of
the
department's
recommendation,
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment,
stating
that
he
had
exaggerated
the
amount
of
time
to
go
to
the
preaching.
during
that
time,
he
made
no
effort
to
check
the
accuracy
of
his
draft
board
file.
he
admitted
at
the
trial
that
he
had
the
right
to
examine
the
file.
he
admitted
that
he
had
the
right
at
the
hearing
before
the
department
hearing,
obviously
go
into
this
thing.
he
did
none
of
these
things.
and
we'd
think
that
in
the
circumstances
since
the
burden
is
upon
--
and
a
registrant
who
claims
conscientious
objector
status,
the
burden
is
on
him
to
establish
his
good
faith
and
sincerity.
we
think
that
the
department
in
this
--
the
government
in
this
case
was
warranted
in
accepting
the
official
report
of
the
board.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
record
pages
109
to
110,
he
personally
stated
that
he
knew
he
had
the
right
to
examine
this.
and
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
very
case,
first,
he
concedes
that
everything
else
in
the
statement
except
for
this
one
paragraph
relating
to
what
he
told
the
board
with
respect
to
the
number
of
hours
is
accurate,
he
doesn't
deny
that.
secondly,
although,
both
the
regulations
and
the
selective
service
classification
form
require
registrant
to
affect
any
change
--
to
report
to
the
draft
board
any
changes
that
may
affect
his
status.
he,
at
no
time,
during
the
three
months
--
three
years,
i'm
sorry
when
he
had
seized
preaching
a
100
hours
a
month
brought
this
to
the
attention
of
the
local
board.
and
indeed,
when
he
came
before
the
local
board
the
second
time
at
his
interview
in
1956,
when
he
was
asked
if
he
had
anything
else
to
report
instead
of
reporting
that
he
had
ceased
his
pioneering
activities,
he
merely
announced
that
he
was
now
married
and
produced
a
copy
of
his
marriage
certificate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
was
asking
for
both
i-o
which
is
conscientious
objector
status
and
also
for
iv-d,
which
is
the
ministerial
classification.
he
had
been
classified
i-a
by
the
local
board.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
the
amount
of
time
he
wouldn't,
but
there
was
--
since
he
was
at
this
point
still
claiming
his
ministerial
classification
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
a
minister?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
wouldn't
think
the
fact
that
he
was
without
a
church,
but
i
think
if
he
had
ceased
performing
his
ministerial
functions
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
organization,
it
does,
because
i
think
a
distinction
has
been
drawn
between
the
man
who
is
just
doing
some
occasional
work
and
the
man
who
is
claiming
the
status
of
a
minister.
mr.
chief
justice,
since
all
the
members
of
this
organization
claimed
to
be
ministers
and
since
it's
clear
that
they
are
not
all
entitled
to
a
draft,
deferment
because
of
their
ministerial
status,
the
dividing
line
of
the
selective
service
has
drawn
as
between
the
pioneer
status,
because
the
pioneer
was
the
man
who
is
in
effect
acting
as
the
pastor.
now,
if
he
would
temporarily
without
a
pastor,
of
course
this
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
but
if
--
if
i
might
suggest
as
an
analogy,
a
--
a
minister
who
quits
the
ministerial
--
his
ministerial
activities
and
decides
to
go
into
the
business
of
publishing
religious
works,
i
think
at
that
point,
he
might
say
he
was
no
longer
a
minister.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
mr.
justice
clark
--
you
asked
the
question
as
to
where
in
the
record
the
statement
of
the
court
of
appeals?
that's
at
191
and
193.
the
court
of
appeals
makes
that
statement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice.
i
think
his
claim
is
not
that
these
papers
were
necessary
to
establish
whether
he
had
or
had
not
made
a
misstatement
but
that
these
papers
were
necessary
in
order
him
to
show
additional
affirmative
evidence
to
support
his
case.
that
is
evidence
of
his
sincerity.
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
that
was
dealt
with
at
the
hearing
before
the
department
of
justice
hearing
officer
relating
to
the
amount
of
time
he
devoted
to
preaching.
and
also,
with
respect
to
the
fbi
reports
which
are
contained
in
the
--
summarized
in
the
resume.
there
too,
the
only
thing
relied
on
in
the
resume
as
the
basis
for
the
department's
recommendation
was
the
fact
that
he
was
then
only
devoting
six
and
half
hours
to
preach
in
this.
the
department
has
not
--
has
not
here
questioned
all
the
additional
material
relating
to
his
good
faith.
the
resume
is
set
forth
to
page
178
to
180
of
the
record.
and
the
--
only
one
incident
in
the
resume
that
it's
unfavorable
and
that
related
to
a
fact,
the
petitioner
had
once
been
picked
up
by
the
police
or
it
was
claimed
that
he
had
attempted
to
pick
some
women
up
on
a
street
late
at
night.
he
denied
that.
the
resume
shows
his
denial
and
the
hearing
officer
has
set
forth
in
the
department's
recommendation,
indicated
that
we
were
not
relying
on
that
fact.
so
the
whole
issue
in
this
case
basically,
is
whether
he
did
make
these
misstatements
before
the
local
board.
his
claims
as
to
his
demand
for
the
hearing
officer's
report
as
for
his
claim
that
he
is
entitled
to
see
the
fbi
reports,
he
does
not,
as
i
understand
it,
claim
that
these
reports
would
tend
to
support
his
argument
that
he
had
not
made
those
misrepresentations,
rather
is
that
this
was
necessarily
to
see
whether
the
resume
fully
set
forth
all
the
favorable
evidence
to
his
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
issue,
mr.
justice
was
not
raised
at
the
hearing.
that
issue
was
only
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
department's
recommendations.
it's
not
disputed
that
at
the
hearing,
there
was
no
discussion
between
the
hearing
officer
and
petitioner
with
respect
to
how
much
time
he
was
devoting
to
his
preaching.
and
while
he
--
he
makes
a
number
of
charges
and
says
that
he
would
prove
this
and
show
that
the
hearing
was
unfair,
we
think
that
in
the
narrow
factual
posture
of
this
case,
those
issues
aren't
properly
presented
to
this
court.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
resume,
he
does
not
now
argue
that
the
--
he
--
well,
he
says
he
doesn't
know
whether
the
resume
fairly
summarized
the
unfavorable
material.
we
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
he
has
not
prejudiced
as
long
as
there
is
nothing
which
forms
the
basis
for
the
department's
recommendation
that
is
not
set
forth
in
the
resume.
now,
the
reason
the
resume
set
forth
nothing
with
respect
to
the
claim
--
claim
of
exaggeration
is
because
at
that
stage
of
the
case,
when
you
merely
had
the
summary
of
the
favorable
and
unfavorable
evidence
in
the
fbi
report,
this
issue
hasn't
been
brought
into
the
case
yet.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
since
this
--
this
court's
decision
in
the
nugent
case,
the
department
has
filed
the
practice
of
giving
registrants
a
resume
not
only
of
the
unfavorable
evidence
but
also
of
the
favorable
evidence
and
that
is
set
forth
in
the
resume
on
this
--
in
this
case
at
page
178.
there
are
set
forth
three
rather
tightly
neat
paragraphs
indicating
that
generally,
this
man
is
regarded
as
a
sincere
person.
the
unfavorable
evidence
of
necessity
which
is
the
incident
with
respect
to
his
being
picked
up
by
the
police,
of
necessity,
this
is
some
--
set
forth
in
somewhat
greater
detail
because
the
whole
purpose
of
the
resume
as
nugent
indicated
is
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
meet
the
unfavorable
evidence.
now,
the
petitioner
was
--
in
accordance
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
gonzales
case,
given
a
copy
of
the
department's
recommendation
to
the
appeal
board
before
the
appeal
board
considerer
the
case
and
he
in
turn
was
given
30
days
within
which
to
answer
that
recommendation.
he
answered
that
recommendation
as
set
forth
in
a
letter
shown
at
page
182
of
the
record.
and
in
that
recommendation,
he
denied
having
made
these
statements.
the
appeal
board
however,
despite
his
denial,
classified
him
in
i-a.
now,
this
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized
that
when
it
comes
to
judicial
review
of
selective
service
classifications,
congress
has
provided
for
only
varying
hour
review.
the
test
is,
is
there
any
faith
that
in
fact
for
what
the
local
or
the
appeal
board
has
done.
the
district
court
which
heard
petitioner
and
the
court
of
appeals
which
studied
the
record,
concluded
that
it
could
not
say
on
this
record
that
there
was
no
basis
in
fact
for
the
denial
of
his
conscientious
objector
claim.
in
other
words,
the
question
we
think
is
not
whether
this
court,
if
it
were
deciding
de
novo,
the
questions
whether
petitioner
had
exaggerated
his
claim
would
or
would
not
reach
the
same
result?
the
question
we
think
is
whether
you
can
--
can
fairly
say
that
there
was
no
basis
for
the
determination
based
on
the
department's
recommendation
that
this
man's
report
as
shown
in
the
official
record
of
the
draft
board
had
grossly
exaggerated
the
amount
of
time
he
devoted
to
preaching
and
that
as
a
result
of
this
exaggeration,
this
raised
a
sufficient
question
as
to
his
trustworthiness
and
sincerity
to
warrant
denial
of
his
claim
for
conscientious
objector
status.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
first
say
that
his
claim
was
--
to
conscientious
objector
status
was
not
denied
because
his
claim
to
ministerial
status
was
not
established
but
rather
because
he
had
been
guilty
as
it
was
--
this
concluded
of
making
a
misstatement,
making
a
full
statement
before
the
board.
now,
all
that
i
can
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
testimony
against
him
is
not
oral
testimony
but
the
testimony
of
this
report.
now,
i'd
like
to
answer
again
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
report,
mr.
chief
justice,
although
it
is
on
the
language
of
his
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
certainly
--
of
course,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
we
think
that
with
this
report
in
his
status
and
with
some
other
evidence
that
i've
been
indicated
such
as
the
fact
that
he
failed
to
advice
the
draft
board
of
his
change
of
status.
well
this
thing
in
the
report,
it
seems
to
me
the
trial
court
was
warranted
in
not
accepting
himself
serving
denial
that
he
made
the
statement.
that
--
that
is
our
basic
position
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
was
--
it
was
(inaudible).
we
think
the
burden
was
on
him
if
in
fact
he
wished
to
disprove
this
report
of
the
draft
board,
made
in
the
course
of
its
official
business.
the
burden
was
on
him
to
call
the
members
of
the
draft
board.
he
could
have
called
them.
he
could
have
at
any
time
when
he
examined
his
file,
at
least
could
have
seen
the
statement
in
and
says,
“i
never
made
that
statement.”
he
didn't
do
that.
he
waited
until
eight
months
thereafter,
and
then
for
the
first
time
denied
it.
and
the
trial
court
had
an
opportunity
to
study
his
credibility.
the
trial
court
examined
him
and
concluded
that
under
the
limited
judicial
review.
in
other
words,
i
think
if
this
court
reverses
in
this
case,
it
will
have
to
say
that
the
government
was
unwarranted
in
accepting
this
official
report
because
of
his
denial.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
--
oh
no,
mr.
justice.
i'm
sorry.
he
has
been
held
not
to
be
a
conscientious
objector.
in
other
words,
the
misstatement
--
but
he
was
found
who
have
made
before
the
local
draft
board,
raised
a
sufficient
doubt
as
to
his
sincerity
to
make
it
appear
that
he
was
not
a
conscientious
objector.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
what
the
chief
justice
read
from
was
the
resume
of
the
fbi
reports
which
are
the
statements,
summarized
the
statements
of
his
friends,
his
employers
and
his
religious
associates
that
he
was
sincere.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
contradict
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
and
i
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
because
--
but
this
court
has
indicated
in
the
witmer
case
which
we
think
is
controlling
here
that
when
you're
dealing
with
conscientious
objection
unlike
the
ministerial
exemption
which
turns
on
objective
fact,
that
the
facts
in
conscientious
objection
cases
are
significant
only
insofar
as
they
relate
to
the
ultimate
question
which
is
the
registrant's
sincerity.
now,
we
have
here
a
case
where
his
employers,
friends,
religious
associates
testified,
stated
that
he
was
sincere.
we
have
on
the
other
hand
a
report,
this
official
report
of
the
draft
board
which
indicated
he
was
guilty
of
a
gross
misstatement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
i'd
like
to
refer
it
in
the
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
in
the
--
the
1952
letter,
what
happened
was
he
originally
filed
an
application.
he
was
originally
classified
i-a.
he
then
filed
his
special
form
which
is
required
of
--
to
be
filed
by
applicants
for
conscientious
objectors.
that
is
set
forth
at
page
151.
now,
after
he
filed
that
and
attached
to
that
some
statements,
the
local
board
again
classified
him
in
i-a
and
it
was
after
that
that
he
wrote
this
1952
letter
in
which
he
stated
he
was
devoting
a
100
hours
to
preaching.
after,
as
a
result
of
that
letter,
he
was
then
classified
i-o,
and
then
was
subsequently
again
classified
i-a.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it's
conceded.
as
of
1952,
he
was
devoted.
also
conceded
that
at
the
time
he
appeared
before
the
local
board,
he
was
only
devoting
six
and
half
hours
to
preaching.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
--
we
don't
know
but
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
the
1956
letter
is
not
a
letter.
the
1956
statement
was
made
by
the
clerk
of
the
draft
board.
and
the
19
--
what
the
clerk
did
is
obviously,
he's
copied
what
was
set
forth
in
the
1952
letter,
but
processed
it
with
the
words
(inaudible)
mr.
gonzales'
stated.
there
--
there
is
not
a
--
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
are
not
two
letters.
there's
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
suggest
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
now,
i
suggest
that
perhaps
he
read
the
letter,
perhaps
he
was
merely
asked
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
gonzales.
we
don't
know
what
happened.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
because
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
because,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
can
only
repeat
that
we
had
this
official
record
and
the
burden
was
on
him
to
establish
the
call
the
people
in
connection
with
the
draft
board.
it
may
have
just
been
summary.
this
may
have
been
the
substance,
the
--
perhaps
he
summarized
his
position
in
the
clerk
when
the
clerk
was
obliged
to
prepare
the
report
of
his
appearance
looked
and
saw
this
old
letter
and
so
that's
about
what
he
said
and
copied
it
down.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
presumably.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
i
have
to
if
i
may
answer
that
specifically.
they
put
him
in
jail
because
they
found
that
the
1956
statement
which
involve
a
copying
of
the
1952
letter
in
fact
was
what
he
said.
that
the
copy
of
the
1952
letter
reflected
accurately
as
the
court
below
said,
what
he
told
the
board
and
what
he
told
the
board
was
a
misstatement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
after
the
department
of
justice
held
a
hearing
at
which
he
was
given
the
resume,
the
matter
was
then
referred
to
the
department
to
prepare
its
recommendation
to
the
appeal
board.
and
a
recommendation
was
prepared
and
as
a
result
of
this
to
the
court's
decision
in
the
gonzales
case
a
copy
of
the
department's
recommendation
was
given
to
the
petitioner
and
he
was
given
30
days
within
which
to
reply
and
he
makes
his
reply
to
the
local
board,
and
the
letter
at
page
182
is
the
reply
which
he
made
to
the
appeal
--
i'm
sorry
to
the
appeal
board.
and
then,
on
the
basis
of
this
letter,
the
department's
recommendation
and
the
selective
service
file,
not
the
fbi
reports,
the
local
board
receives
neither
the
fbi
reports
nor
the
hearing
office
of
report
on
the
basis
of
those
documents,
the
appeal
board
classified
him
i-a.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
it
so
states
in
the
4th
and
5th
lines
of
that
letter.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
174
to
177.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
one
paragraph
beginning
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
that
is
--
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
the
department's
recommendation
does
not
refer
specifically
to
the
statement
in
the
local
board.
it
is
set
forth
at
page
175
of
the
record
in
the
department's
recommendation
which
is
--
makes
the
affirmative
statement
that
on
august
17th,
1956
when
he
personally
appeared
before
his
local
board
registrant
(inaudible)
that
he
was
then
devoting
an
average
of
100
hours
a
month.
that
--
that
has
been
--
and
of
course,
at
this
point
--
at
this
point,
when
the
department
made
the
recommendation,
had
no
be
--
basis
at
all
to
know
that
petitioner
would
subsequently
challenge
the
correctness
of
that
statement
of
the
local
board.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
that's
specifically
provided
in
the
regular
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
--
they
are
sent
but
at
--
at
all
stages
through
the
proceeding,
the
registrant
has
the
opportunity.
the
file
is
sent
to
the
department
of
justice.
it's
first
sent
to
the
hearing
office
and
he
can
review
his
file
and
discuss
it
with
the
hearing
officer,
it's
then
sent
to
the
appeal
board.
but
he
had
opportunity
throughout
these
proceedings
to
check
this
file
and
make
sure
that
the
statement
is
accurate.
and
of
course,
finally,
he
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
knew
that
he
had
the
opportunity
to
examine
this
file.
yes,
that
is
set
forth
at
pages
109
and
110
of
the
record.
that's
his
trial
testimony.
so,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
