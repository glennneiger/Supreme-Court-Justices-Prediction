mr.
hayden
c.
covington
may
it
please
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
other
gentlemen
of
the
court.
the
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
case
brings
here
for
review
a
decision
of
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
confirming
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
colorado
convicting
the
petitioner
in
this
case
for
a
violation
of
universal
military
training
and
service
act.
we
present
to
the
court
by
the
petition
for
substantial
questions.
first
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
was
denied
procedural
due
process
of
law
by
the
department
of
justice
making
use
of
a
memorandum
of
the
local
board
that
was
made
without
any
notice
or
knowledge
to
the
petitioner
that
he
had,
upon
the
occasion
of
his
personal
appearance
before
the
board,
exaggerated
his
ministerial
activity
when,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
had
discontinued
full-time
ministry
therefore
and
he
had
no
notice
of
this
until
effort
was
too
late,
namely,
when
the
recommendation
got
into
the
board
of
appeal.
he
had
the
opportunity
to
answer
for
the
first
time
and
then
the
department
of
justice
had
already
formed
this
position
against
him.
the
second
question
is
whether
or
not
he
was
denied
procedural
due
process
of
law
before
the
appeal
board
by
the
withholding
of
the
report
of
the
hearing
by
the
hearing
officer
of
the
department
of
justice.
we
have
two
additional
questions
that
are
procedural
and
if
--
it
would
be
reached
if
the
court
does
not
decide
the
first
two
in
our
favor,
namely,
whether
or
not
the
district
court
denied
procedural
due
process
of
law
and
disallowing
the
request
of
the
petitioner
by
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
command
the
production
of
the
hearing
officer's
report
which
was
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
that
he
had
been
denied
procedural
due
process
of
law
before
the
appeal
board
in
several
respects
and
the
withholding
of
the
hearing
officer's
report,
and
then,
also
the
quashing
of
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
commanding
the
production
of
the
fbi
reports
which
had
been
summarized
by
the
department
of
justice
and
forward
it
to
the
appeal
board.
this
petitioner
registered
--
registered
with
his
local
board
in
the
southern
colorado
and
--
at
the
time
so
that
he
was
the
minister
of
jehovah's
witnesses
and
the
conscientious
objector.
at
that
time,
he
was
engaged
full-time
in
a
big
sugar
business
working
secularly.
and
also,
he
was
a
full-time
minister,
a
pioneer
in
the
organization
of
jehovah's
witnesses
having
been
certified
as
such
by
the
watchtower
bible
and
tract
society.
he
showed
these
facts
to
the
local
board
and
the
local
board
denied
both
the
ministerial
exemption
and
the
conscientious
objector
classification.
the
case
then
proceeded
on
appeal
to
the
board
of
appeal
where
there
was
a
hearing
before
appealed
decision
and
hearing
in
the
department
of
justice.
in
the
interim,
he
had
discontinued
his
full-time
ministry
and
the
résumé
of
the
department
of
justice
inquire
had
showed
that
he
had
discontinued
his
ministerial
activity
full-time
according
to
the
report
of
an
interview
with
an
officer
of
the
watchtower
society,
the
governing
body
of
jehovah's
witnesses
in
brooklyn.
the
appeal
board
denied
the
classification
of
conscientious
objector,
and
he
was
ordered
prosecuted
but
because
of
decisions
of
this
court,
the
case
in
sicurella
against
the
united
states,
the
first
recommendation
of
the
department
of
justice
was
considered
to
be
illegal.
and
then,
the
case
was
reopened
and
reprocessed
according
to
local
board
memoranda.
then
it
becomes
--
the
very
crucial
and
vital
question
in
this
case
arises
on
the
second
process.
he
had
his
classification
of
one
and
then
he
requested
a
personal
appearance
and
hearing
before
the
board
which
was
granted
on
august
the
17th,
1956.
according
to
the
undisputed
evidence,
the
testimony
i'm
talking
about
now,
and
in
this
connection,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
that
the
government
did
not
call
any
board
member,
did
not
call
the
clerk
of
the
board
but
continued
itself
merely
with
the
subpoenaing
of
the
custodian
of
the
records
of
the
selective
service
system
for
the
entire
state
of
colorado,
mr.
(inaudible),
the
deputy
director.
the
testimony
shows
that
gonzales,
when
he
was
before
the
local
board,
offered
to
prove
that
he
was
a
minister
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
had
discontinued
the
full-time
ministry,
but
he
never
got
around
to
the
point
of
giving
any
evidence,
whatever,
for
the
purposes
for
which
he
want
therefore,
namely,
because
when
he
appeared
there,
the
board
told
him
that
they
had
already
considered
this
matter
and
have
their
minds
made
up
and
the
case
was
going
to
the
board
of
appeal.
so,
he
got
no
opportunity
to
talk.
then
he
was
--
and
in
fact,
driven
out
of
the
board
according
to
his
testimony
which
was
not
disputed.
and
the
case
on
that
day,
that
very
day
of
hearing
was
forwarded
to
the
board
of
appeal
and
here,
it's
significant
to
note
that
nowhere
in
this
draft
board
file
is
there
a
written
notice
of
appeal
that
the
government
talks
about
him
having
a
right
to
file
supplement
to
it
setting
forth
arguments
and
facts
that
he
felt
the
board
had
overruled.
but
on
the
very
day,
and
i
call
your
attention
to
a
paper
that's
not
printed
but
which
appears
in
the
exhibit
1,
the
government's
exhibit
at
page
42
in
longhand,
at
the
lower
right
hand
corner
of
the
exhibit
1
there
is
called
an
individual
appeal
record.
now,
the
record
in
this
case
has
printed
the
questionnaire
which
has
the
minutes
on
page
136.
but
that
--
those
minutes
are
not
complete
and
they
do
not
show
everything
that
happened
in
this
case,
namely,
the
date
that
this
case
was
forwarded
to
the
board
of
appeal,
august
the
17th,
1956.
it's
usually
the
regular
procedure
of
draft
boards
to
allow
several
days
for
a
registrant
to
file
some
sort
of
a
written
statement
before
the
papers
go
out.
but
since
they
told
him
that
he
could
appeal
orally,
and
he
did
so
appeal
when
he
had
no
opportunity
to
complete
his
testimony
before
them
are
offered
when
he
went
there
to
prove,
there
was
no
chance
for
him
to
file
any
statement
on
appeal
and
also,
there
was
no
chance
for
him
to
make
any
complaint
about
this
memoranda
of
august
the
17th
of
1956
that
we
complain
about
where
they
take
up
and
copy
a
letter
that
was
written
to
the
board
back
in
three
or
four
years
earlier
when
he
was
a
full-time
pioneer
and
make
it
appear
that
he
had
been
given
a
full
hearing
on
the
ministry
that
day
and
that's
set
forth
on
page
7
in
my
brief,
in
footnote
5.
it's
identical
in
every
respect.
and
on
the
left
column,
you'll
see
that
--
to
show
that
they
copied
that
old
letter
verbatim,
would
like
to
appear
in
person.
if
that
was
a
memoranda
of
the
local
board
of
what
happened
to
that
personal
appearance,
it's
ridiculous
to
assume
that
while
he
was
then
presently
appearing
before
the
board,
that
he
would
like
to
appear
in
person.
my
point
is
that
when
he
took
this
appeal
in
this
state
of
affairs
to
the
board
of
appeal,
the
whole
file
was
sent
to
the
board
of
appeal.
he
had
no
opportunity
to
know
that
that
memoranda
had
been
put
in
the
file.
then,
the
case
was
referred
to
the
department
of
justice
and
they
conducted
the
fbi
inquiry.
then
there
was
a
résumé
made
of
that
fbi
inquiry.
he
was
given
a
notice
to
appear
before
hearing
officer,
evensen
in
boulder,
colorado,
i
believe
it
was,
and
did
appear.
and
at
that
hearing,
evensen
did
not
go
in
to
this
business
of
this
exaggerated
statement.
he
didn't
bring
up
anything
about
that
at
all.
he
went
into
a
lot
of
other
matters
that's
not
necessary
to
relate
here
on
this
particular
question.
and
after
having
given
this
man
a
hearing
and
not
having
brought
up
this
business
of
exaggerated
hours,
which
the
man
testified
he
never
did,
all
he
did
is,
apparently,
took
this
old
letter
and
copied
it
in
there
as
a
memoranda
of
what
had
occurred.
the
government
argues
that
he
read
that
letter
to
the
board.
well,
there
is
no
testimony
to
support
that.
they
didn't
bring
the
clerk.
they
didn't
bring
any
board
member.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
yes,
sir.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
after
he
had
been
indicted.
and
he
was
in
the
office
of
mr.
evensen.
and
i
was
present
interviewing
him
in
denver,
colorado
two
days
before
the
trial
in
the
district
court.
that's
the
first
time
he
learned
of
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
recommendation
of
the
department
of
justice
does
not
even
refer
to
the
memorandum.
it
merely
said
that
he
had
exaggerated
his
hours
whereas
the
first
résumé,
and
i'd
to
direct
your
attention,
the
government
said
that
this
man
fooled
the
board
about
these
matters,
i'd
direct
your
attention
to
page
165
and
167
--
166
and
67.
that's
the
résumé
of
the
first
inquiry
before
this
case
was
reprocessed
showing
in
the
records
that
this
man
have
discontinued
the
pioneer
minister.
and
also,
his
letter
there
showed
that
he
was
now
married
and
was
doing
masonry
work,
all
of
this
before
the
second
processing.
they
say
that
he
should
have
notified
the
board
when
he
was
before
the
board
on
personal
appearance.
his
testimony
is
he
didn't
even
have
a
chance
to
tell
them
anything
about
this
matter.
before
they
--
he
left,
they
did
ask
if
he
had
any
additional
evidence
to
offer
and
he
brought
out
about
his
having
gotten
married
which
they'd
already
been
notified
about.
but
--
anyway,
he
had
his
hearing.
the
case
went
then
to
the
review
officer
in
washington
on
the
conscientious
objector
section.
and
the
--
that
review
officer
then
did
not
notify
this
man
of
this
intent
to
rely
on
this
memoranda
or
the
contents
of
it,
but
made
this
recommendation
against
him
adversely
on
this
paper
that
he
have
no
notice
of.
he
got
the
notice
of
course
that
they're
relying
on
this
contention
after
he
got
the
--
after
they
had
made
their
recommendation
to
the
appeal
board.
but
after
all,
that
was
entirely
too
little
and
too
late,
as
i
state
and
show
on
my
brief.
now,
it's
my
suggestion
to
the
court
that
gonzales
applies
here.
this
man
was
ruled
against
for
all
practical
purposes
before
the
appeal
board
without
any
notice
of
the
position
that
the
department
was
taking
until
it
was
entirely
too
late.
they
say,
“oh,
he
have
the
right
to
answer
the
recommendation.”
but
that's
entirely
too
little
and
too
late.
here's
the
powerful
department
of
justice.
the
records
show
95%
of
all
their
recommendation
are
accepted
by
the
appeal
board
having
taken
this
position
against
him.
and
it's
preposterous
to
believe
that
he
had
a
--
any
sort
of
a
chance
to
answer
that
recommendation.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did
attempt
to
answer
and
show
the
truth
of
the
matter
but
his
recommend
--
his
answer
was
ignored.
i'm
going
to
pass
up
the
argument
about
the
hearing
officer
report
having
been
--
should
have
been
included
in
the
file.
i
take
the
position,
the
outstanding
regulations
that
were
in
existence
when
congress
passed
the
law
on
1948
and
then
again
in
1951,
required
that
it'd
be
included
because
the
old
procedure
at
that
time
required
that
it'd
be
included.
they
say
it's
harmless.
i
say
it's
very
important
because
this
man
took
two
witnesses
when
he
went
there
to
--
appear
before
evensen.
and
that
--
purpose
of
that
report
was
to
give
a
record
of
evidence
that
was
offered.
and
consequently,
it
should
have
been
included
for
the
benefit
of
the
appeal
board
under
section
6
(j)
of
the
act.
coming
now
to
the
subpoena
business,
error
of
the
district
court
in
quashing
these
subpoenas.
that
hearing
officer's
report
should
have
been
brought
to
--
before
the
district
judge
to
enable
me
to
approve
that
the
hearing
officer,
at
least,
had
included
favorable
evidence
or
had
not
included
a
record
of
this
testimony.
at
least
the
recommendation
of
the
department
of
justice
is
not
even
referred
in
any
of
this
testimony
that
this
man
offered
through
himself
and
two
witnesses
before
the
hearing
officer.
so
the
fact
the
recommendation
is
silent
on
it,
then
the
way
to
get
at
it
was
to
get
the
subpoena
to
command
the
production
of
that
hearing
officer's
report
and
make
the
comparison
of
the
two
to
see
if
this
man
was
denied
procedural
due
process
before
the
appeal
board
on
--
in
that
respect.
coming
now
to
the
question
of
the
error
of
the
court
in
quashing
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
commanding
the
production
of
the
fbi
report,
the
hearing
officer
had
the
original
reports.
the
hearing
officer
used
the
original
reports.
it's
true
the
defendant
was
sent
a
résumé
along
with
the
recommendation
that
went
from
the
appeal
board
to
him.
he
got
the
résumé
of
the
first
inquiry
and
the
second
inquiry.
but
i
say
to
you,
gentlemen,
that
when
congress
passed
the
draft
law
in
1940
and
reenacted
it
in
1948
and
again
in
1951,
congress
intended
that
not
only
the
adverse
evidence
be
included
from
the
fbi
report
but
also
the
favorable
evidence.
congress
didn't
intend
to
have
a
one-sided
presentation
or
a
one-sided
hearing
in
the
department
of
justice
on
this
conscience
objector
claim.
therefore,
it
was
wrong
for
the
department
of
justice
to
make
a
résumé
only
of
the
unfavorable
and
merely
refer
to
the
favorable
evidence.
and
i
say
this,
that
i
have
the
right
to
prove
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process
in
the
appeal
board
by
the
withholding
of
favorable
evidence
by
the
department
of
justice
in
making
this
résumé
of
the
inquiry.
and
when
i
--
the
only
way
you
can
do
that
is
to
subpoena
the
original
report
and
show
that
there
was
an
inadequate
and
an
unfair
résumé
made,
just
like
i
argued
in
the
fourth
circuit
about
the
matter.
it's
just
like
litigating
the
adequacy
of
a
book
review
on
the
district
court.
how
can
the
district
judge
determine
the
matter
without
reading
the
book?
but
does
he
do
it
just
by
reading
the
book
review?
it's
as
simple
as
that.
the
law
has
allowed
him
to
make
these
résumés.
and
(inaudible)
allowed
him
to
get
by
with
not
producing
the
fbi
report
in
the
administrative
level.
they
prosecute
the
man
because
he
violates
the
order
of
an
administrative
agency.
he
had
the
opportunity
to
prove
--
should
have
had
the
opportunity
in
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
résumé
was
adequate.
did
it
withhold
favorable
evidence?
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
in
quite
that
congress
intended
that
this
fbi
inquiry
and
hearing
on
the
department
of
justice
be
in
the
favor
of
the
registrant,
namely,
to
turn
up
favorable
evidence.
the
very
purpose
of
taking
the
appeal
was
to
correct
any
errors.
the
law
says
it's
got
to
be
fair
and
just.
the
thing
can't
be
fair
and
just
unless
both
sides
are
heard.
it
can't
be
fair
and
just
when
favorable
evidence
is
withheld
from
the
appeal
board.
i
say
that
i
am
not
satisfied
in
these
cases
until
i
have
the
opportunity
to
look
at
the
original
fbi
report.
a
lawyer
can't
do
his
duty
to
a
client
to
determine
whether
or
not,
and
the
court
can't
do
its
duty
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
has
been
favorable
evidence
withheld
from
the
appeal
board
until
a
comparison
has
been
made
between
the
two.
even
judge
sobeloff
admitted
that
when
he
wrote
the
opinion
in
blaylock.
i
respectfully
submit
it.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
comment
on
the
answer
of
counsel
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
entire
draft
board
file
was
sent
as
i
told
the
court
in
my
opening
argument,
within
three
hours
after
this
hearing
was
held
because
it
was
mailed
on
the
very
day
that
the
hearing
was
held
on
august
17th,
this
paper
number
42
shows
it
was
mailed
on
that
day
and
the
record
shows
the
hearing
was
held
at
1:30
in
the
afternoon.
by
--
by
the
time
business
closed
on
that
day,
this
was
on
the
mails.
and
after
that,
he
had
no
opportunity
to
see
that
file
or
inspect
it
and
that's
what
i
tried
to
bring
out
at
the
trial
at
--
at
the
hearing
officer's
hearing,
which
was
the
only
opportunity
that
he
ever
had
to
look
at
the
file,
the
hearing
officer
did
not
notify
him,
or
give
him
any
clue
to
suspect
that
the
local
board
had
mailed
such
--
made
--
made
such
a
memoranda.
and
the
file
was
not
shown
to
him
by
the
hearing
officer
and
i
went
into
this
matter,
tried
to
go
into
it
at
the
trial
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
subpoenaed
the
hearing
officer's
report
of
what
took
place
at
the
hearing
because
i
thought
the
official
report
would
be
the
best
record
of
what
took
place
at
the
hearing.
and
i
wanted
to
prove
and
attempted
to
do
it
in
any
every
human
way
that
a
lawyer
could
do
it,
that
this
hearing
officer
did
not
bring
to
him
this
business
about
these
memoranda
that
had
been
filed
with
the
local
board.
the
only
time
that
he
ever
learned
of
this
alleged
exaggeration
is
when
this
recommendation
of
the
department
of
justice
was
sent
to
him
by
the
appeal
board
which
as
i
say,
too
little
and
too
late.
and
even
it,
in
the
recommendation,
does
not
even
give
him
a
clue
that
there
was
a
memoranda
made
by
the
local
board
on
this
point.
that's
the
situation.
it's
pure
and
simple.
from
the
time
of
this
hearing,
they
were
in
such
a
big
hurry
to
get
this
case
under
the
local
board's
hand
that
they
couldn't
wait
five
days
for
him
to
have
the
usual
opportunity
to
make
an
inspection
of
the
file
and
see
whether
the
board
had
prepared
something
false
against
him
which
they
had
done.
and
as
i
say,
he
didn't
learn
it
until
the
day
before
we
went
to
trial
in
denver.
so
the
file
was
not
available
at
anytime
until
we
got
a
photostatic
copy
of
the
file
following
the
indictment.
and
then,
it
was
entirely
too
late
to
do
anything
except
to
try
to
make
the
defense
that
we
did
attempt
to
make
in
the
district
court.
he
told
the
court
that
the
only
question
involved
in
this
cases
is
what
the
court
said
in
the
estep
case
about
their
being
no
basis
in
fact,
but
justice
douglas
went
on
to
say
in
there,
also
that
if
there
had
been
a
violation
of
pursuit
in
due
process,
then
even
though
if
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
the
granting
of
the
--
no,--
i
mean
no
basis
in
fact
for
the
giving
of
the
classification
procedural
due
process
of
law
would
invalidate
it
just
like
the
a
man
maybe
guilty
of
murder,
but
he
has
denied
apparent
fould.
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
reversal,
so
it
is
in
the
conscientious
objector
situation
and
the
administrative.
and
this
court
held
in
sicurella,
and
simmons
and
gonzales
when
the
department
of
justice
had
made
these
violations.
procedurally,
that
there
is
an
invalidation
of
the
draft
board
classification
and
that's
all
we're
trying
to
prove
here
or
attempt
to
show
here.
that
this
whole
set
up
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
deliberate
on
the
part
of
the
clerk
to
the
board
but
anyhow,
it's
a
--
it's
a
chain
of
the
events
that
resulted
in
this
predicament
that
this
man
was
thrown
into
and
against
which
he
could
not
defend
until
he
got
in
the
district
court
which
was
entirely
too
late.
now,
stating
that
the
--
the
notification
as
i
said
it
out
--
at
the
outset
in
the
opening
argument
given
to
him
by
the
appeal
board
after
they
had
received
the
recommendation.
i
say
that's
entirely
too
late.
this
thing
had
been
frozen
against
him
in
the
department
of
justice
and
nobody
at
anytime
notified
him
that
this
memoranda
was
in
the
file.
even
when
the
case
was
before
the
appeal
board,
he
didn't
have
a
chance
to
tell
that
appeal
board,
“that
local
board
has
lied
to
you
gentleman.”
they
just
merely
used
the
general
allegation.
he
exaggerated
his
hours.
there
was
no
notice
there
that
there
was
a
false
memoranda
in
that
draft
board
file.
in
degraw
against
toon
the
second
circuit
said
and
this
court
also
held
in
gonzales
when
the
thing
is
he
has
gone
to
the
appeal
board
and
when
this
happens
like
this
behind
the
man's
back,
he
is
entitled
to
make
his
defense.
it's
a
denial
of
due
process
under
any
theory
of
--
of
the
constitution.
now,
they
state
that
the
appeal
board
decision
was
based
entirely
upon
this
last
paragraph
in
the
recommendation.
i
say
that
the
only
way
that
you
can
reach
that
conclusion
is
to
find
some
memoranda
in
the
file
made
by
the
appeal
board
that
that
was
the
basis
for
it.
we've
shown
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process
here.
we
say
since
the
local
--
the
appeal
board
made
no
memoranda,
we
must
speculate
all
of
us
as
to
what
was
the
real
basis
for
this
decision.
it
could
have
been
maybe
he
didn't
have
enough
proof,
maybe
he
didn't
make
a
prima
facie
case.
it
could
have
been
anything.
so
why
speculate
about
it,
we
can't
do
it
and
then
paid
them
on
down
on
the
third
circuit
and
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
i
said
you
can't
speculate
when
the
appeal
board
has
failed
to
make
a
memoranda.
those
pieces
are
cited
in
the
brief
that
i
wrote.
berman
against
craig
for
the
third
circuit
is
the
decision
that
i
didn't
cite
in
my
brief,
but
they
hold
that
this
registrants
are
not
to
be
treated
as
though,
they
were
draft
--
i
mean
litigants
represented
by
counsel.
and
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
green
case
held
the
same
thing
that
a
man
is
not
to
be
treated
as
though
he
is
required
to
dot
every
“i”
and
cross
every
“t”.
and
they
thought
they
want
to
do,
they
want
to
get
a
conviction
on
speculation
and
then
when
you
get
into
the
appeal
court,
they
come
in
with
all
sorts
of
speculation
and
--
and
start
treating
these
registrants
as
though
they
are
litigants
represented
by
counsel
which
is
very
unfair.
the
government
was
caught
in
a
situation
somewhat
like
this
and
the
--
and
a
case
that
i
had
out
in
the
sixth
circuit
about
10
or
12
years
ago,
and
--
and
that
is
in
the
niznik
case.
now,
we
would
have
welcomed
to
litigate
this
matter
with
the
board
members
present
and
the
clerk
of
local
board
being
present.
it
wasn't
our
responsibility
to
subpoena
these
people.
we've
developed
our
defense,
but
the
only
witness
we
had,
which
was
the
defendant.
and
there
--
under
no
theory
of
the
law
especially
when
they
haven't
explained
who
made
that
memoranda
dated
on
august
the
17th,
which
contains
in
--
in
the
exact
copy
of
that
letter
written
four
years
ago,
his
status
was
to
be
determined
finally
as
the
status
at
the
time
of
the
final
classification.
and
as
the
seventh
circuit
held
in
that
case
i
had
back
in
1943
that
(inaudible)
they
said
that
a
man
has
to
be
judged
according
to
his
status
as
of
the
date
of
the
final
classification.
and
the
fact
that
there
had
been
this
change
from
1952
to
1957
gave
that
local
board
no
right
to
reach
back
there
and
put
back
52
statuses
in
there
as
though
he
had
set
it
as
a
fact.
he
denied
saying
it.
they
heard
this
testimony
at
the
trial,
the
district
judge
could
have
held
the
court
at
--
in
half
a
day
until
he
got
on
the
phone
and
brought
somebody.
in
all
of
these
cases,
they
usually
bring
the
clerk
as
a
prosecuting
witness.
but
in
this
case
for
some
reason,
they
saw
a
reason
not
to
bring
the
clerk.
why
didn't
they
bring
the
clerk?
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
your
honor,
the
--
there
is
another
court,
of
--
the
judge
--
judge
kauffman.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
that
was
the
fbi,
your
honor.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
yes.
judge
kauffman
in
the
erickson
case
denied
the
pretrial
production,
but
after
trial
by
subpoena,
allowed
the
hearing
officers'
minutes,
that
is
stenographic
report
of
the
hearing
to
be
produced
and
at
that
trial,
you
read
his
opinion
on
the
erickson
case,
he
refers
to
that
stenographic
report
of
the
hearing.
now
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
i
hope
--
i'd
like
to
go
on
to
say
there
is
another
district
judge
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
--
over
in
this
eastern
district
of
new
york,
made
the
same
ruling
and
i
cite
that
case
in
my
brief.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
it's
united
states
against
erickson,
and
my
memory
is
eluding
me,
but
if
you
will
permit
me,
i'll
give
the
name
of
the
case
with
the
clerk
before
i
leave
the
courthouse.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
wieder
--
excuse
me,
u.s.against
wieder,
w-i-e-d-e-r.
i
think
it's
cited
in
my
brief.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
if
the
circumstances
here
--
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
--
develop
that
there
is
some
controversy
and
here
where
there
was
a
contest,
the
hearing
officer's
memory
was
silent
on
what
took
place
at
this
hearing.
i
wanted
to
go
into
it
and
he
first,
before
the
noon
recess,
he
said
he
couldn't
remember.
and
after
the
noon
recess,
why
he
wasn't
too
sure
about
it.
so
that's
why
i
wanted
the
hearing
officer's
report
to
find
out
what
had
happened
at
the
hearing,
so
i
think
it
should've
been
allowed
by
the
district
judge.
where
there
is
a
question
of
facts
to
what
took
place
at
the
hearing
and
especially
when
you
bring
two
witnessed
and
you're
contending
if
they
didn't
make
a
fair
report
of
what
the
witnesses
said
to
the
appeal
board
and
the
hearing
officer's
report
is
the
only
record
to
prove
that,
the
hearing
officer's
reports
should
have
been
looked
at
by
the
district
judge
and
by
me.and
i
object
to
the
do
the
in
camera
sealing
it
up
as
the
offer.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
well,
i
did,
your
honor.
but
after
all,
he
was
--
i
say
an
adverse
witness.
he
was
certainly
a
government
employee
and
i
took
the
position,
i
wasn't
bound
by
his
testimony,
but
he
didn't
say
anything
that
hurt
--
hurt
me
anyhow.
so
i
--
i
subpoenaed
him
because
it
was
the
only
way
that
we
could
get
a
copy
of
the
hearing
officer's
report.
the
original
was
in
washington
and
he
was
in
colorado,
so
we
got
and
subpoenaed
to
just
take
him
out
to
command
him
to
produce
it,
that's
all.
now
on
the
fbi
question,
this
is
a
very
--
i
want
to
come
back
to
what
happened
in
the
niznik
case.
i
caught
the
government
in
situation
like
this
where
they
didn't
bring
there
witness
in
the
trial
court
and
i
asked
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal
in
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
niznik
case,
a
173
f.2d.328
not
withstanding
that
the
evidence
was
undisputed,
the
defendant's
testimony
on
the
one
hand
and
the
draft
board
on
the
other,
they
said,
“well,
we're
--
will
send
this
case
back
for
a
new
trial.
we'll
remand
it
so
the
board
members
can
come
in
and
let
them
tell
the
district
court
what
happened.”
and
i
won
the
case
when
i
took
it
up
on
the
second
appeal
a
184
f.2d
972.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
17
--
no,
it
isn't,
your
honor.
this
came
up
just
since
the
argument.
173
f.2d
328,
judge
mcallister
wrote
the
opinion,
and
184
f.2d
972
is
after
the
second
trial.
but
if
the
government
--
i
don't
want
to
take
advantage
of
the
government.
we
did
everything
we
did.
if
the
court
thinks
that
the
government
can
produce
witnesses
to
contradict
what
the
defendant
said,
let
them
try
it
and
we'll
go
to
trial
again
on
the
matter.
but
i
think
on
the
record,
when
they
have
the
opportunity
to
do
it
in
subpoena
power
and
didn't
do
it,
they
ought
to
be
treated
like
any
litigant,
the
acquittal,
a
lot
of
them
sustained.
but
if
we
go
back
to
trial
in
this
matter,
i
do
beg
the
court
as
i
have
in
many
petitions
to
pass
on
this
subpoena
the
fbi
point.
this
thing
has
plagued
us.
this
has
been
dangled
before
us
without
any
relief.
and
i
say
that
in
justice,
if
due
process
allows
an
inquiry
into
the
fairness
of
a
resume,
the
only
way
you
can
decide
whether
it's
fair
is
to
compare
the
resume
with
the
original
fbi
reports.
and
i
had
been
after
this
time
and
time
again.
i
brought
10
cases
up
here
and
now,
finally,
this
one
is
in
here.
i
wanted
to
get
the
bull's
eye
in
the
case
in
there
because
that
was
such
an
outrageous
case
also
from
denver.
mr.
hayden
c.
covington
no
sir.
not
--not
in
the
least.
nugent
did
not
pass
on
this
subpoena
question.
that's
where
judge
sobeloff
made
the
mistake.
and
when
i
was
down
there
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
i
argued
that,
they
were
wrong
in
misapprehending
nugent.
nugent
didn't
pass
on
the
subpoena.
it
only
dealt
with
the
matter
in
the
administrative
level.
and
for
that
matter,
i
say
that
nugent,
if
it
is
meant
to
say
that
you
have
only
a
resume
of
the
unfair
evidence
and
omit
the
responsibility
to
make
the
summary
of
the
fair
evidence
--
i
mean
the
favorable
evidence,
it
misconceives
the
intent
of
congress.
i
say
the
reason
the
court
spoke
only
of
unfair
evidence
is
because
--
unfavorable
evidence
is
because
that
was
the
only
question
we
argued
and
considered
when
we
are
here
in
the
nugent
case
in
the
1950.
and
naturally,
the
court
did
not
have
in
its
view
the
question
of
favorable
evidence,
but
certainly,
congress
intended
that
the
favorable
evidence
be
provided.
certainly,
congress
didn't
intend
for
some
one-sided
investigation
and
hearing
to
be
conducted.
it's
outrageous
since
it
is
not
an
adversary
proceedings
and
the
intent
of
the
investigation
is
to
turn
up
favorable
evidence
as
well
as
unfavorable.
and
we
keep
hammering
at
this
thing
and
men
are
going
to
prison
and
a
certiorari
is
such
an
uncertain
thing
to
get
in
here,
i
know
that
the
court
can
deal
only
with
the
important
questions.
you
don't
sit
here
as
a
court
of
error,
but
after
this
thing
has
been
recurring
so
many
times
and
would
still
get
this
prosecutions
coming
on,
the
question
is
dangling.
there
is
an
old
way
that
the
lawyer
can
do,
except
keep
raising
it
and
hammering
away
at
it.
if
the
court
finally
says
that
i'm
wrong,
i'll
take
it
like
i
took
it
in
the
nugent
case.
now,
that's
--
i'm
not
criticizing
the
court,
i'm
just
merely
explaining
to
the
court
a
situation
of
great
serious
importance
that
we've
got
in
these
cases.
that's
all.
and
until
this
court
resolves
the
question,
we
always
run
across
some
judge
like
judge
dawson
in
seventh
district
to
refuse
to
follow
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
he
flat-footedly
refused
to
follow
all
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
have
ruled
against
him
in
this
matter.
now,
i
think
when
judge
dawson,
a
man
of
his
reputation
and
integrity
refuses
to
follow
the
courts
of
appeal,
there's
something
wrong
somewhere,
respectfully
submitted.
