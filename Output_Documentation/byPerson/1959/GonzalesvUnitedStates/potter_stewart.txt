justice
potter
stewart
is
he
coming
to
the
point
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
when
--
when
did
the
petitioner
first
learned
of
this
memorandum?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
his
classification
at
that
time?
what
was
he
asking
for?
justice
potter
stewart
because
this
--
the
--
the
amount
of
time
he
devoted
to
preaching
wouldn't
have
any
bearing
at
all
on
whether
or
not
he
should
be
classified
i-o,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wouldn't
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
a
valid
reason
why
he
would
have
told
the
local
board
that
he
was
still
--
presumably
still
devoting
100
hours
to
preaching.
now,
i'd
like
to
also
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
friedman.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
friedman,
on
page
--
this
letter
on
page
182
of
the
record
dated
april
--
april
23,
1957
which
the
petitioner
wrote
to
the
appeal
board
--
justice
potter
stewart
where
he
did
raise
this
precise
issue,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
where
does
this
fit
in
the
chronology
of
this?
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
letter,
appearing
on
page
182
was
sent
to
the
appeal
board
after
he
had
had
a
copy
of
the
department
of
justice's
recommendation
and
before
the
appeal
board
had
made
its
ruling.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
the
reason
i
asked
my
question
was
that
i
understood
from
mr.
covington
that
the
--
that
the
first
that
the
petitioner
actually
learned
about
this
report
of
the
local
board
of
the
summarizing
the
statement
to
the
effect
that
he
was
still
--
said,
he
was
working
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
100
hours
as
a
mystery
--
oh
as
a
minister
that
the
first,
the
petitioner
learned
about
that
was
two
or
three
days
before
the
trial
of
this
criminal
case.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
it
your
further
point
that
all
this
time,
the
--
the
local
board's
files
on
this
petitioner
were
available
to
him.
justice
potter
stewart
they're
--
they're
not
sent
to
the
justice
department
or
to
the
appeal
board?
justice
potter
stewart
who
called
the
hearing
officer
as
a
witness?
