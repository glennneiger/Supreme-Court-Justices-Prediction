justice
charles

whittaker
was
this
not
also
suggested
if
i
may
ask.
was
there
any
claim
by
this
man
before
the
court
of
indigence
and
inability
therefore
to
hire
and
pay
a
lawyer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
wozencraft,
is
it
your
argument
--
mr.
wozencraft,
did
not
--
what
about
the
testimony
of
the
young
lady
at
the
bank
who
said
that
this
man
admitted
to
her
that
he
--
claimed
to
her
that
he
had
been
authorized
to
sign
elsie's
name
to
these
checks?
didn't
--
isn't
there
a
testimony
like
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
told
the
young
lady
at
the
bank
he
was.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
i
was
thinking
about
the
testimony
of
the
young
lady
at
the
bank,
had
connection
with
what
you've
just
now
related.
that
testimony
of
the
sheriff
would
appear
on
the
face
of
it,
it
was
direct
opposition
to
the
terms
of
the
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
was
there
not
enough
without
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
would
--
must
be
an
admission
that
he
did
do
the
signing.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
might
mean
the
court
uses
that,
would
it?
i've
had
the
finding
that
that
doesn't
give
you
a
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
going
to
discuss
the
question
of
mootness?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
could
that
be
done
in
a
habeas
corpus
case
though,
mr.
wozencraft?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
that's
a
little
different
thing.
you've
got
the
body
of
the
person
who's
to
be
delivered
still
in
existence,
but
here
however,
if
this
writ
issued
to
this
respondent,
how
could
it
be
complied
with?
the
writ
would
be,
deliver
up
the
body,
he
doesn't
have
the
body.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
could
we
get
this
man
into
some
inconsistent
to
maybe
severe
position
here?
suppose
this
writ
were
to
issue
on
some
basis,
and
it
be
thus
held
that
this
trial
was
illegal.
now
then,
he
could
be
subject
to
trial
again.
and
then
the
given
even
a
greater
sentence
than
before
and
even
if
given
credit
for
the
time
he'd
served,
he'd
still
have
to
go
back
to
jail,
wouldn't
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
he
hasn't
served
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what's
the
answer
to
this
--
is
there
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
always
think
it
would
be?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
would
be
running
--
taking
calculated
risk.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
have
no
question
about
that,
do
you
think
that
was
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
one
serious
mistake
can
cause
his
character
witnesses
you
referred
to
because
on
cross-examination
of
one
of
them,
he
had
to
admit
that
he
was
the
recipient
of
one
of
the
defendants'
objects
as
you
took
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
just
as
a
matter
of
practicalities,
do
you
really
believe
that
any
layman
is
confident
to
conduct
a
trial
in
a
court
of
record?
justice
charles

moot.
