mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
by
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
a
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
was
handed
down
on
august
29th,
1958.
the
opinion
was
written
by
judge
cameron
and
judge
reeves
dissented.
rehearing
was
denied
on
september
29th
of
--
1958,
certiorari
was
filed
on
october
24th
of
1958,
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
march
2nd,
1959.
it
also
granted
petitioners
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
and
i
was
appointed
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
by
this
court.
in
--
on
june
6
of
1959,
petitioner
finished
serving
his
sentence
in
the
huntsville
penitentiary
with
time
off
for
good
behavior.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
on
june
6,
1959,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
was
three
months
after
certiorari
was
granted
and
at
that
time,
he
was
dismissed
from
the
penitentiary.
i
informed
the
court
of
this
dismissal
and
suggested
that
there
might
be
continuing
legal
effects
of
this
conviction
of
his
and
that
if
the
court
wished
me
to
argue
the
possible
applicability
of
the
pollard
case,
i
would
be
happy
to
do
so.
the
court
has
informed
counsel
through
its
clerk
to
add
mootness
to
the
issues
to
be
argued
in
the
brief
and
in
the
oral
argument.
as
in
the
briefs,
i'd
like
to
turn
first
to
the
question
of
denial
of
due
process
because
i
believe
that
this
may
effect
in
some
way
because
--
which
the
court
may
want
to
take
in
its
discretion
on
the
question
of
possible
mootness.
the
question
of
course
is
as
your
honors
are
aware,
the
denial
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
by
denial
to
this
petitioner
and
the
right
to
counsel.
the
colloquy
in
which
this
occurred
is
set
forth
in
the
brief
for
petitioner
on
pages
seven
and
eight.
the
court
called
him
for
trial,
asked
if
he
was
ready
for
trial.
he
replied
yes.
the
court
says,
“do
you
want
a
trial
by
jury
or
without
a
jury?”
parker
says,
“well
--
and
it's
immaterial
to
me
judge,
i
don't
have
any
attorney.”
the
court,
“well,
you're
going
to
have
to
make
up
your
mind.
it
is
certainly
immaterial
to
the
court?”
parker
says,
“i
guess
a
jury
then.”
“do
you
have
a
lawyer
hired?”
“no,
i
don't.”
the
court
then
advised
the
petitioner
that
the
law
does
not
require
the
court
to
appoint
an
attorney
to
represent
a
defendant
and
a
--
when
--
where
he
has
a
trial
by
jury
and
it's
not
the
practice
of
this
court
to
appoint
any.
it's
up
to
him
to
arrange
for
his
own
counsel.
if
he
wanted
a
suspended
sentence,
they
would
arrange
perhaps
for
him
to
have
counsel
as
to
that
particular
question
but
not
as
to
the
merits.
and
mr.
parker
said,
“well,
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer.
alright,
he's
ready
for
trial.”
it
is
the
position
of
petitioner
that
under
the
long
established
line
of
cases
of
this
court
in
the
cases
such
as
johnson
versus
zerbst
in
304
u.s.
and
in
uveges
versus
pennsylvania
in
335
u.s.
that
this
was
certainly
not
a
knowing
denial
of
the
right
to
counsel.
the
trial
which
--
which
succeeded
this
--
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
there
is
a
special
statute
in
texas,
your
honor,
that
says
“as
to
a
suspension
of
sentence
plea,”
when
he
wants
a
suspended
sentence
that
he
can
--
he
can
obtain
counsel
for
it.
i
believe
this
is
whether
or
not
he
has
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
yes,
definitely.
so
that
there
is
a
misstatement
by
the
court,
a
clear
denial
of
any
counsel
to
be
provided
by
the
court
for
this
man,
in
this
jury
trial.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that
that
can
be
claimed
to
be
a
specific
request,
but
i
don't
believe
that
a
specific
request
is
necessary
under
the
decisions
of
these
case
and
you've
--
of
this
court
in
uveges
versus
pennsylvania
and
in
johnson
versus
zerbst,
particularly
whereas
here
--
it
must
be
apparent
to
the
court
as
matter
proceeds
that
there
is
no
possible
way
by
which
this
man
can
know
enough
to
protect
his
rights
without
a
counsel.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
that
that
appears
before
the
court,
but
again
in
the
little
town
of
dumas,
things
like
that,
you
could
almost
take
judicial
notice
off.
i
don't
mean
that
the
court
really
should
if
in
this
case,
but
there
is
a
distinct
absence
of
any
question
by
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
he
could
afford
counsel
as
to
whether
he
hadn't
taken
any
steps
to
obtain
counsel
or
could
do
so.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
that
i
would
not
be
able
to
justify
the
course
of
the
legislation
(voice
overlap)
in
creating
that
statute
or
--
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
--
to
explain
its
motives.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
it's
still
on
the
statute
books,
but
fortunately,
as
i
mentioned
later
in
this
brief,
there
has
--
since
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case,
an
amendment
to
the
texas
statute
authorizing
right
to
counsel
in
any
felony
case
by
anyone
so
accused.
so
that
the
provision
for
suspended
sentence
now,
i
suppose
is
a
dead
letter
which
will
not
be
impealled
--
appealed
but
fortunately
will
no
longer
may
need
it.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
requiring
it
under
the
circumstances
set
out
in
the
statute,
your
honor.
this
appears
in
my
brief
on
page
five
where
the
amendment
is
--
the
amendment
is
set
forth
that
when
it
is
made
known
to
the
court
at
an
arraignment
or
any
other
time
that
an
accused
charged
with
a
felony
is
too
poor
to
employ
a
counsel,
the
court
shall
appoint
one
or
more
practicing
attorneys
to
defend
him,
who
will
have
ten
days
to
prepare
for
trial.
and
it
then
goes
on
to
say
that
in
the
bill,
enacting
this
amendment
that
the
fact
that
the
previous
article
applied
to
capital
cases
and
does
not
apply
to
ordinary
felonies,
creates
an
emergency
and
an
imperative
public
necessity.
that
means
that
it
must
go
immediately
into
effect
upon
its
signature
by
the
governor
and
this
amendment
is
now
in
effect.
as
the
trial
progressed,
it
became
perfectly
clear
and
i
think
it
will
become
clear
to
anyone
who
--
who
reads
this
record
that
this
petitioner
was
way
beyond
his
debt,
impossibly
helping
to
cope
with
the
intricate
complex
legal
problems
that
were
presented.
the
very
indictment
refers
only
to
a
forgery
by
him
of
the
signature
of
--
elsie
quattlebaum
wherein
fact
it
was
a
forged
check
drawn
on
phoebe
quattlebaum
by
elsie
quattlebaum.
in
this
connection,
it
should
be
noted
as
judge
reeves
noted
in
his
dissenting
opinion
that
the
quattlebaums
were
partners-in-laws
and
that
elsie
parker
--
elsie
quattlebaum
had
been
an
enemy
of
his
for
years
and
it's
set
forth
in
an
affidavit
later
coming
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
and
this
fact
was
never
made
known
to
the
jury.
now,
and
of
course
as
--
as
--
and
be
assured
that
parker
could
have
made
this
known
if
he'd
had
any
idea
of
its
significance,
but
he
did
not
and
it
seems
that
it's
the
kind
of
a
thing
that
a
counsel
certainly
would
have
made
known
and
would
have
tried
to
inquire
further
to
find
out
just
what
was
really
involved
in
this
case.
how
these
checks
happened
to
be
written?
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
there
is
testimony
that
he
was
authorized
to
sign
the
checks.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
and
this
is
testimony
incidentally
which
even
though
it
is
just
hearsay,
raises
what
we
regard
as
an
affirmative
defense
on
which
this
petitioner
was
entitled
to
an
instruction
of
the
jury,
the
possible
defense
of
a
authority
which
is
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
crime
of
forgery
is
that
it
be
without
lawful
authority.
here
is
another
situation
where
an
error
of
the
judge
in
the
trial
is
highlighted,
and
one
which
competent
counsel
should
have
been
able
to
call
attention
to.
there
is
also,
your
honor,
a
statement
in
this
record
where
the
sheriff
says
that
--
that
parker
admitted
signing
the
checks
and
the
--
this
is
one
of
the
elements
in
this
case
that
just
amazes
me
more
than
any
other.
here,
we
have
the
--
the
square
language
or
article
727
of
the
texas
code
of
criminal
procedure
which
we
set
forth
on
page
5
in
our
brief
that
the
confession
shall
not
be
used
if
at
the
time
it
was
made,
the
defendant
was
in
jail
or
other
place
of
confinement,
nor
while
he
was
in
the
custody
of
an
officer,
unless
made
in
the
voluntary
statement
of
accused
taken
before
an
examining
court
or
made
in
writing
and
signed
by
him
after
all
kinds
of
warnings.
and
not
only
did
this
come
in
the
testimony,
it
was
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
affirming
his
conviction.
it
was
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
denying
his
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
is
referred
to
twice
in
the
brief
for
respondent
in
this
court.
now,
granted
it
came
into
evidence
and
certainly,
it
has
been
relied
upon
ever
since
then
to
the
detriment
of
this
petitioner
and
i
submit
that
it
would
never
come
in
if
petitioner
had
had
a
counsel.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
your
honor,
i'm
not
familiar
with
al
the
gloss
but
i
--
it
would
take
more
than
a
gloss,
it
would
take
a
rewrite
to
justify
what
happened
here
and
it
has
not
been
rewritten.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
well,
your
honor,
as
i
say,
there
was
no
denial
of
authority
anywhere
in
this
evidence,
anywhere,
in
fact,
just
a
contrary.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
the
statement
of
the
bank
teller
that
he
said
he
was
authorized.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
coming
of
course
from
the
other
side
and
i
think,
though
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
the
testimony
perhaps
to
that
effect
of
the
--
of
the
bank
teller
and
of
the
sheriff
who
comes
before
the
court
stating
what
has
been
told
to
him.
certainly,
it
is
corroborating
testimony
and
i
cannot
imagine
that
--
that
the
fact
that
--
that
she
herself,
that's
what
the
bank
teller
had
said,
would
make
a
harmless
error
to
have
a
corroboration
of
that
testimony.
certainly,
from
an
officer
of
the
peace
with
whom
the
judge
must
have
been
well
acquainted
and
the
jury
in
a
small
community
must
have
known.
as
the
trial
further
progressed,
the
evidence
came
in
from
the
sheriff
that
this
man
was
under
indictment
in
another
case.
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
nature
of
that
case.
i
don't
know
whether
the
indictment
is
still
on
the
books
having
been
told
while
this
man
was
in
jail
or
whether
it
is
now
been
dismissed.
but
in
any
event,
here
again,
is
a
direct
violation
of
article
732
(a)
of
code
of
criminal
procedure
in
texas
which
appears
on
page
6
of
our
brief,
which
says
that
this
indictment
is
not
admissible
to
impeach
and
there
is
a
little,
it
says
--
and
impeaching
any
person
as
a
witness
and
perhaps
there
is
a
difference
here
between
a
man
being
a
defendant
and
being
a
witness
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
anything
is
worst,
hears
it
to
impeach
a
defendant
than
it
had
to
impeach
a
witness.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
your
honor,
that's
a
--
that's
a
point
i
wanted
to
come
to.
i
believe
that
a
reading
of
this
record
will
make
it
clear
that
the
entire
attitude
of
this
judge
is
summed
up
in
his
comment
in
questioning
this
man
on
whether
or
not
he
wants
a
jury.
he
says,
“it
is
--
certainly
immaterial
to
this
court.”
there
is
no
instance
in
this
record
wherein
at
any
--
at
anytime
the
judge
intervened
to
protect
this
petitioner
or
any
of
his
rights
and
i
believe
that
the
conviction
of
this
petitioner
was
certainly
immaterial
to
this
court.
under
texas
law
and
i
believe
under
due
process
where
a
man
does
not
have
a
counsel,
there
is
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
judge
to
be
extra
careful
that
he
is
protected
in
his
rights.
there
was
no
move
of
this
kind
at
any
stage
by
the
trial
judge
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
no,
sir.
the
only
statement
of
the
judge
was
“do
you
have
one?”
and
he
says
no.
he's
aware,
“we
won't
give
you
one
because
you're
not
up
for
a
capital
appeal.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
and
it
also
should
be
noticed
that
--
that
the
sheriff
testified
at
the
trial
that
petitioner
had
been
suffering
from
heart
trouble
and
had
been
receiving
medicine
while
he
was
in
jail
from
the
sheriff.
he
gotten
it
for
him
from
the
drugstore.
in
other
words,
this
was
a
sick
man
at
the
time
he
was
tried
and
as
judge
reeves
says
in
his
dissent,
a
reading
of
the
record
makes
it
pretty
clear
that
he
was
a
sick
man.
it
certainly,
lends
support
to
his
--
to
his
claim
of
that.
if
he
did
not
make
that
claim
at
the
trial,
that
is
true.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
saying
that
he
really
--
didn't
need
a
lawyer,
says
that
he
didn't
raise
this
point
properly
by
a
motion
for
continuance
which
certainly,
it
would
have
taken
a
lawyer
to
tell
him
how
to
raise.
the
sheriff's
testimony
verbatim
on
page
68
of
the
record
on
this
point
of
illness,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
is
yes,
sir,
he's
been
in
very
ill
health.
i've
had
to
buy
him
medicine
and
had
to
take
him
up
and
give
him
shots.
i
believe
the
doctor
says
he
has
heart
trouble.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
indigence.
this
certainly
would
have
called
into
the
attention
of
the
court,
i
agree
with
your
honor.
it
is
also
called
to
the
attention
of
this
court
by
the
fact
that
it
took
him
several
months
in
the
prison
to
try
to
obtain
a
copy
of
the
record.
he
did
so
finally
by
getting
one
of
his
fellow
convicts
to
fork
up
$25.
that
was
the
way
he
finally
got
the
record
in
this
case,
and
that
is
one
of
the
circumstances
which
well
may
have
affected
his
delay
in
obtaining
a
final
decision
in
this
case.
it
seems
perfectly
clear
to
a
man,
i
hope
it
will
to
this
court
that
after
considering
the
statutes
here
at
least
in
the
testimony
that
--
that
here,
we
have
issues
so
extremely
complex
that
it
would
be
utterly
hopeless
to
ever
hope
that
petitioner
could
have
defended
himself
properly
without
the
aid
of
counsel
even
if
he
had
waived
his
right
to
counsel
which
we
certainly
urged
that
he
did
not,
this
record
on
itself
shows
a
denial
of
due
process
because
this
trial
itself
was
not
a
fair
trial
and
it
did
not
meet
the
common
standards
of
fairness
which
this
court
and
every
court
has
a
right
to
expect
from
a
trial
court.
it
is
the
--
our
contention
that
--
that
this
comes
almost
directly
within
the
wording
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
uveges
versus
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
in
335
u.s.
where
the
gravity
of
crime
and
other
factors
such
as
the
age
and
education
of
the
defendant.
there,
in
uveges,
the
defendant
was
young,
here,
he
has
aged
and
i'll.
the
conduct
of
the
court
in
the
--
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
he
was
67
at
the
time
of
the
trial
your
honor.
and
he
had
been
ill
from
heart
trouble
for
about
two
years.
the
affidavits
of
doctors
appear
in
the
record.
and
the
complicated
nature
of
the
defense
charged
and
the
possible
defenses
thereto,
render
criminal
proceedings
without
counsels,
so
aft
to
result
in
injustice
as
to
be
fundamentally
unfair.
the
latter
group
holds
that
these
are
cases,
the
betts
versus
brady
decisions,
that
the
accused
must
have
legal
assistance
under
the
amendment
whether
he
pleads
guilty
or
likes
to
stand
trial,
whether
he
request
counsel
or
not.
only
a
waiver
of
counsel,
understandingly
made,
justifies
trial
without
counsel.
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
counsel
for
all
persons
charged
with
serious
crimes,
when
necessary
for
their
adequate
defense
in
order
that
such
persons
maybe
advised
how
to
conduct
their
trial.
i
would
like
now
if
i
may
to
turn
or
let
me
just
wrap
this
up
with
--
with
one
statement.
there
was
a
charge
by
the
judge
to
the
jury,
the
--
the
defendant
mr.
parker,
the
petitioner
did
not
testify.
he
called
witnesses
on
his
own
behalf
and
all
he
said
was
“joe,
tell
him
what
you
know
about
him.”
and
they
said
“well,
he's
a
sick
man,
a'
pretty
good
man,
a
sick
man.
then
the
sheriff
and
the
--
the
prosecuting
attorney
came
in
and
asked
one
of
them,
“did
you
ever
get
any
hot
checks
from
this
defendant
who
has
called
you
as
his
witness?”
and
the
--
the
witness
said,
“well,
yes
i
did,”
to
the
judge.
so
that
the
hot
check
charged
from
the
man
that
he
himself
had
brought
onto
this
stand
was
introduced
into
evidence.
the
--
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
in
the
town
of
dumas,
texas
and
moore
county.
it's
in
the
panhandle
north
of
amarillo
but
quite
away.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
i
don't
know
exactly,
your
honor.
i
would
guess
5000.
i've
been
through
it
once
but
i
didn't
feel
any
incentive
to
stay
very
long.
in
the
charge
to
the
jury,
the
judge
did
not
raise
any
possible
affirm
--
affirmative
defenses
or
a
request
to
any
special
consideration
of
them
and
the
jury
verdict
as
might
not
be
surprising
in
view
of
the
previous
convictions
as
to
which
testimony
had
entered
the
record,
and
the
other
elements
of
which
i've
just
spoken
was
a
resounding
guilty.
the
possible
sentence
for
forgery
is
two
to
seven
years,
the
jury
recommended
a
sentence
of
seven
years,
the
maximum.
it
is
that
penalty
which
petitioner
served
his
sentence
under
and
was
finally
discharged
with
time
of
for
good
behavior
on
june
6
of
this
year.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
right
now,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
as
i
say
in
the
brief,
this
is
a
situation
where
if
--
he
had
had
counsel
to
guide
him
through
these
procedural
requirements,
and
let
him
know
what
he
was
supposed
to
do
in
his
habeas
corpus
petitions.
the
record
is
full,
correspondence
between
him
and
the
clerk
of
the
u.s.
district
court
where
he
hasn't
sent
the
right
documents
or
needs
other
documents.
a
tremendous
amount
of
time
was
consumed
by
that
process
because
this
man
simply
did
not
know
what
he
was
supposed
to
do,
but
he
filed
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
with
the
(inaudible)
court
of
criminal
appeals,
very
promptly
after
he
entered
prison
and
he
has
been
working
on
that
petition
through
the
entire
time
he
was
in
prison,
now
when
he
did
finally
finish
serving
his
sentence
on
june
6th,
it
was
more
than
three
years
after
he
applied
to
the
district
court
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
more
than
seven
months
after
his
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
and
more
than
three
months
after
it
was
granted
by
this
court.
if
he
had
had
counsel,
there
would
have
been
plenty
of
opportunity
for
this
court
to
decide
his
case
last
term
while
he
was
still
in
prison.
even
without
the
--
the
time
which
was
required
for
certiorari
and
i'm
certainly
familiar
with
how
long
it
takes
in
forma
pauperis
record
that
were
put
there
with
nine
difficulties
to
make
the
round,
stil,
four
and
a
half
months
elapsed
between
the
time
that
he
filed
his
petition
and
the
time
it
was
granted.
and
any
rushing
up
of
the
process,
anywhere
along
the
line
and
he
could
have
gotten
the
ruling
of
this
court
before
he
finished
serving
his
sentence.
or
even
if
he'd
slugged
the
guards
and
sacrificed
his
term
time
off
for
a
good
behavior,
he'd
still
be
there
and
we
would
be
talking
solely
about
the
points
that
i've
just
finished
discussing.
however,
he
did
get
out
and
there's
no
denying
that
there
is
a
close
question
here
about
whether
the
court
which
clearly
had
jurisdiction
at
the
time
it
had
granted
certiorari
has
lost
that
jurisdiction
simply
because
he
is
finished
serving
his
sentence.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
petition
--
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
sir,
when
i
said
--
i
--
i
meant
to
ask
whether
this
court
has
lost
jurisdiction
which
it
clearly
had
when
it
granted
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
it
is
our
contention
that
it
does
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
court
traditionally
has
power,
always
has
had
power
to
issue
its
orders
and
its
writs
as
all
the
date
while
it
still
had
jurisdiction
when
there
are
matters
which
have
taken
place
after
that
jurisdiction
attached,
such
as
the
death
for
instance
of
one
of
the
parties.
the
plea
of
abatement,
the
abatement
which
would
terminate
jurisdiction
can
be
overcome
by
the
courts
entering
the
order
nunc
pro
tunc
as
of
the
date
when
it
was
ripe
for
decision
after
the
court's
jurisdiction
had
attached.
we
submit
that
in
this
sense
--
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
well,
the
case
of
mitchell
versus
overman,
sir
of
--
of
this
court,
103
u.s.
62,
your
honor
dealt
with
the
right
of
an
iowa
court
to
which
--
which
took
--
at
the
iowa
state
court
which
took
a
case
under
advisement
and
then
while
it
was
under
advisement,
one
of
the
parties
died.
this
is
on
26
of
my
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
well,
i
noted
in
several
cases
involving
federal
officials,
your
honor,
and
the
same
principles
apply
except
that
there
you
have
federal
statutes
--
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
well,
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
and
not
always
does
the
court
ever
have
to
exercise
a
discretionary
power
and
this
power
is
discretionary.
but
when
you're
talking
about
federal
officials,
you're
dealing
with
the
1925
statute
which
provides
for
the
substitution
of
new
parties
within
a
six-month
period.
and
i
think
that
--
that
is
pretty
well
discussed
in
the
case
of
schneider
versus
buck
in
this
court
in
340
u.s.
where
you
held
that
because
of
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
statutory
requirement,
the
action
would
have
to
be
abated.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
and
here,
we
contend
that
there
are
continuing
legal
consequences
that
flow
from
any
felony
conviction
are
present
in
this
case
and
by
themselves,
this
would
provide
a
thread
of
jurisdiction.
but
i
don't
believe
we
even
have
to
reach
that
point,
your
honor,
because
in
mitchell
versus
overman,
this
court
has
fairly
first
stated
that
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
state
court
lost
jurisdiction
when
this
man
died
and
that
--
that
its
jurisdiction,
whether
you
talk
about
abatement
of
parties
or
abatement
of
issue.
it's
pretty
much
part
of
the
same
horse
and
i
think
the
decision
of
this
court
in
mitchell
versus
overman
is
precedent
for
the
decision
here.
now,
let
me
emphasize
again,
sir,
that
this
--
this
power
is
a
discretionary
power.
it
is
one
which
the
court
is
--
freely
admit
under
no
obligation
to
exercise.
i
also
freely
admit
there
had
been
many,
many
cases
in
which
it
has
not
been
exercised.
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
perhaps
see
fit
to
exercise
it
more
frequently
beginning
with
this
case.
there
was
one
case
where
it
was
--
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
because
i
believe,
sir,
that
when
a
man
has
a
felony
conviction
on
his
record,
and
when
he
fights
his
way
up
to
get
it
reviewed,
whether
it's
by
this
court
or
whether
it's
by
a
court
of
appeals
or
any
other
court,
i
believe
that
that
man
should
have
the
right
to
clear
his
record.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
your
honor,
this
was
the
way
which
was
open
to
this
man
at
the
time
when
he
filed
his
--
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
--
petition
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
there
maybe
other
way,
sir.
i'm
not
familiar
with
--
well,
you
might
bring
a
mandamus
against
a
voting
registrar
or
--
or
something
like
that,
but
this
is
the
way
which
he
has
chosen
and
this
is
the
way
as
of
--
of
which
this
court
had
jurisdiction
at
that
time
that
it
granted
his
petition
for
certiorari.
now,
may
i
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
to
one
case
where
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
but
involving
the
opposite
side
offense,
this
court
did
use
its
power
to
issue
a
judgment
nunc
pro
tunc
and
that
is
the
case
of
quon
quon
poy
versus
johnson.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
well
sir,
in
that
case,
it
was
done
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
in
--
in
the
reverse
direction.
there,
they
remanded
quon
quon
poy
to
the
jurist
--
to
the
--
to
the
custody
of
a
commissioner
of
immigrations
who
had
already
died.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
your
honor,
he
has
already
delivered
up
the
body
by
turning
petitioner
loose.
but
as
of
the
time
when
this
judgment
would
be
entered,
as
of
the
time
when
the
order
would
run
to
him,
he
had
the
body.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
that's
the
whole
basis
of
this
--
this
nunc
pro
tunc
power
of
the
court.
it
would
--
it's
--
in
this
case,
it
so
happens
that
there
would
be
no
need
for
further
implementation
of
the
order,
the
order
would
implement
itself.
it
--
it
has
been
implemented
in
effect
after
the
time
as
of
which
the
judgment
would
be
entered.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
the
maximum
sentence
was
seven
years,
your
honor
and
that's
what
he
got.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
he
did,
sir,
with
time
off
for
good
behavior
--
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
--
which
is
a
statutory
allowance.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
well,
your
honor,
it's
--
it's
certainly
is
one
which
we've
considered
and
it
is
our
feeling
that
--
that
he
had
served
his
sentence.
i'm
not
certain
of
the
--
of
the
statute
of
limitations
but
on
the
crime
of
forgery,
unless
it
were
told
by
all
of
this
proceeding,
that
would
take
care
of
it.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
i'm
afraid
it
might.
it
seems
to
me
that
he
has,
as
i
say,
served
his
term
in
any
event
and
by
receiving
credit
for
that
time,
would
not
be
subjected
to
further
sentence.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
well,
that's
what
i'm
hoping
to
be
dealing
with
now,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
your
honor,
there's
no
denying
of
the
intermediate
texas
court
without
considering
the
arguments
or
the
opinion
in
the
logan
case
has
so
held
very
peremptorily
an
election
contest
where
they
were
considering
that
with
several
other
disputed
ballots.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
has
not
spoken
on
this
subject.
i
would
submit
that
this
court
should
not
decide
whether
or
not
it
should
exercise
its
jurisdiction
by
whether
or
not
the
supreme
court
of
texas
would
follow
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
its
--
in
the
inferior
state
court
or
whether
it
would
invoke
the
reasoning
set
forth
in
logan
versus
united
states
which
also
appears
in
my
brief
and
where
this
court
stated
in
common
law
and
on
general
principles
of
jurisprudence
were
not
controlled
by
express
statute,
giving
effect
within
the
state
which
enacts
it
to
a
conviction
and
sentence
in
another
state,
such
conviction
and
sentence
can
have
no
effect
by
way
of
penalty
or
a
personal
disability
or
disqualification
beyond
the
limits
of
the
state
in
which
the
judgment
is
rendered.
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
will
agree
with
you
hardly
and
it's
very
difficult
here
to
trace
what
the
exact
continuing
legal
consequence
is
of
this
conviction
may
be.
but
i
will
submit
to
this
court
that
any
felony
conviction
inevitably
has
continuing
legal
consequences.
in
a
decision
for
instance
of
a
court
whether
or
not
to
invoke
--
well,
or
--
or
a
district
attorney
even
of
whether
or
not
to
invoke
habitual
offender
statutes.
the
right
to
run
for
office
goes
with
the
right
to
vote
in
texas.
and
while
i
don't
expect
mr.
parker
to
be
a
candidate
for
governor
anytime
soon,
this
is
part
of
his
array
of
civil
rights.
a
man
who
is
convicted
of
a
felony
loses
those
civil
rights
that
he
may
have
lost
them
in
some
other
fashion.
i
don't
believe
he'd
be
regarded
as
removing
the
legal
consequences
of
this
particular
conviction
on
his
record.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
i
am
prepared
to
make
an
alternative
argument
--
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
--
that
this
will
support
jurisdiction
as
well
--
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
but
nunc
pro
tunc
is
a
substitute
--
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
if
i
may,
i'm
going
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
no,
sir.
there
is
not
unfortunately.
i
wish
there
were.
mr.
frank
w.
wozencraft
yes
sir,
it
certainly
would.
