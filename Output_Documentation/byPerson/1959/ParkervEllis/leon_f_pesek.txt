mr.
leon
f.
pesek
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
it
is
the
contention
of
respondent
in
this
case,
sir,
that
the
real
question
before
this
court
embodies
the
question
of
whether
the
court
has
lost
jurisdiction
because
the
question
has
in
fact
become
moot
as
was
discussed
by
mr.
wozencraft.
certain
things
have
happened.
on
june
the
6th,
1959,
petitioner
was
freed
from
all
restraint
and
that
respondent
here
and
mr.
o.b.
ellis,
who's
the
general
manager
of
the
texas
prison
system,
freed
him,
has
been
--
no
longer
has
him
in
any
type
of
custody
or
confinement.
it
is
the
position
of
respondent
that
the
purpose
of
the
great
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
to
be
used
by
one
who
is
unlawfully
confined.
now
throughout
the
record,
petitioner
asked
for
one
thing
in
his
application,
to
be
freed
from
unlawful
restraint
and
imprisonment.
that
restraint
or
imprisonment,
lawful
or
unlawful,
no
longer
exists.
calling
your
attention
to
title
28,
section
2241
of
the
code
where
it
in
subsection
(c)
it
states
that,
“the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
shall
not
extend
to
a
prisoner
unless
--
paragraph
3,
he
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution
or
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states.”
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
briefly
quote
from
the
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
case
of
heflin
versus
united
states
where
he
stated,
“the
very
office
of
the
great
writ,
its
only
function
is
to
inquire
into
the
legality
of
the
detention
of
one
in
custody.”
it
is
unnecessary
to
paraphrase
here
mr.
justice
stone's
penetrating
discussion
in
mcnally
versus
hill,
293
u.s.
131,
or
to
incorporate
the
thorough
review
of
legal
history
there
contained.
it
will
suffice
to
note
only
the
court's
decision
--
court's
conclusion,
excuse
me,
without
restraint
of
liberty,
the
writ
will
not
issue.
equally
without
restraint
which
is
unlawful,
the
writ
may
not
be
used.
a
sentence
which
the
prisoner
has
not
begun
to
serve
cannot
be
the
cause
of
restraint
which
the
statute
makes
the
subject
of
inquiry.
and
i
might
add
to
that,
that
a
sentence
which
has
already
been
served
is
no
longer
a
restraint
which
the
statute
makes
the
subject
of
inquiry.
i
should
also
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
case
of
st.
pierre
versus
the
united
states
which
is
a
case
almost
identical
in
point
to
the
case
before
us.
there,
pierre
--
st.
pierre
was
convicted
of
contempt
of
--
having
contempt
to
court
rather
and
was
assessed
five
months
in
the
penitentiary
or
in
--
he
was
assessed
five
months
in
confinement
and
he
asked
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
and
before
this
court
could
decide
the
question
involved,
he
had
been
discharged
and
the
mootness
question
arose
in
that
case
and
this
court
held
in
that
case
that
we
are
of
opinion
that
the
case
is
moot
because
after
petitioner's
service
of
his
sentence
and
its
expiration,
there
was
no
longer
a
subject
matter
on
which
the
judgment
of
this
court
could
operate.
a
federal
court
is
without
power
to
decide
moot
questions
or
to
give
advisory
opinions
which
cannot
affect
the
rights
of
the
litigants
in
the
case
before
it
and
they're
citing
some
cases.
and
the
court
continued,
the
sentence
cannot
be
enlarged
by
this
court's
judgment
and
reversal
of
the
judgment
below
cannot
operate
to
undo
what
has
been
done
or
restored
to
petitioner
the
penalty
of
the
term
of
imprisonment
which
he
has
served.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
if
i
may
refer
to
my
notes
just
a
moment
to
refresh
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
very
well,
sir.
in
the
case
of
wales
versus
whitney,
114
united
states
564,
in
speaking
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
as
this
court
stated
that
its
purpose
is
to
enable
the
court
to
inquire
first
if
petitioner
is
restrained
of
his
liberty.
if
he
is
not,
the
court
can
do
nothing
but
discharge
the
writ.
there
must
be
actual
confinement
or
the
present
means
of
enforcing
it.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
me
a
question
before
recess
i
would
like
to
go
into
and
that
involved
the
case
of
united
states
--
pollard
versus
the
united
states.
in
that
case,
your
honor,
the
petitioner
there
was
convicted
of
a
federal
offense
at
an
earlier
time
and
he
thought
he
was
being
led
off
that
without
any
sentence
at
all.
he
left
the
courtroom
and
later
on
that
day,
the
district
attorney
came
up
to
the
judge
and
said,
“judge,
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
mr.
pollard?”
he
says,
“oh,
yes,
give
him
three
years
and
probate
the
sentence.”
some
two
years
later,
he
got
into
some
more
trouble
of
federal
offense.
it
faded
me
just
what
it
was.
and
instead
of
going
and
trying
in
for
that
one,
the
judge
revoked
the
probation
and
he
was
confined
in
the
penitentiary.
he
filed
for
his
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
but
in
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
on
the
--
that's
right,
sir.
and
then,
in
that
case,
he
was
saying
that
the
judgement
itself
was
unlawful
that
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
try
the
case
because
there's
no
question
about
him
not
being
present
or
his
attorney
being
present
at
the
time
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
didn't
even
know
that
he
was
under
such
a
sentence.
and
that
--
in
that
particular
case,
they
said
however
that
because
there
--
there
were
other
factors
involved
that
would
make
the
--
him
lose
on
his
merits,
they
refused
to
--
this
court
had
refused
to
grant
him
the
writ
because
it
said
it
would
not
--
it
would
serve
no
use
for
purpose,
because
he
would
lose
on
his
merits,
if
they
send
it
back
to
the
trial
in
the
federal
court.
this
court
also
held
that
it
will
not
render
a
judgement
unless
it
can
in
some
way
be
of
material
effect.
now,
comparing
that
case
with
--
to
our
present
case,
where
we
--
we
come
to
the
question
of
some
type
of
moral
stigma
that
might
be
placed
upon
the
petitioner
here.
the
one
stigma
that
was
alleged
it
might
--
could
have
occur
would
be
that
of
a
--
his
failure
to
vote.
but
the
records
of
this
case
disclosed
that
he
had
been
previously
convicted
in
other
states
on
--
i
believe
it
was
eight
other
felonies
under
texas
law
whether
this
case
was
set
aside
or
not,
he
would
lose.
he
would
not
be
able
to
vote.
also,
i
might
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
language
that
he
used
in
the
st.
pierre
case
where
the
man
was
saying
that
--
applicant
was
also
saying
that
--
suggesting
that
the
judgement
might
impair
his
credibility
as
a
witness
in
future
legal
proceedings,
the
court
here
held
that
the
moral
stigma
of
a
judgement
which
no
longer
affects
legal
rights,
does
not
present
a
case
or
controversy
for
appellate
review
since
it
causes
moot,
the
writ
will
be
dismissed.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
the
--
the
statute,
your
honor,
is
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
oh,
yes.
the
--
just
for
a
moment,
sir.
that
is
harwell
versus
morris,
143
s.
w.
2d
809.
that's
in
my
--
i
believe
i
quoted
that
in
my
brief.
and
in
that
case,
if
you
want
me
--
would
you
want
me
to
discuss
that?
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
the
law
in
texas
--
yes,
sir.
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
plus
the
article
that
provides
that
a
conviction
of
the
felony
deprives
a
man
the
right
of
voting
under
article
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
yes,
sir.
it
would,
but
it
is
our
contention
based
on
--
and
that's
the
only
case
that
i
was
able
to
find
was
the
harwell
case.
and
it
sort
of
indirectly
came
in
their
own
--
new
mexico
and
the
right
to
vote.
it
was
an
election
contest
and
this
new
mexico
man
right
was
denied
to
vote
there.
and
that's
the
only
case
that
we
have
--
that
i've
been
able
to
find,
sir,
in
texas.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
i
would
say
that
it
was
moot,
your
honor,
in
that
--
in
answer
to
that
specific
question,
because
he
had
been
already
convicted.
i've
said
it
in
other
times.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
in
--
in
regard
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
yes,
sir.
it
is
in
the
transcript.
that
is
one
of
the
alleged
errors
that
he
said
he
was
committing
at
the
trial
but
--
that
is
on
page
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
that
is
true,
sir.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
ignoring
my
future
argument,
your
honor,
on
regard
due
process
clause,
i
would
say
that
they're
--
if
he
was
innocent
of
the
crime
charged
that
the
--
there
is
a
possibility
--
i
could
foresee
a
possibility
that
he
might
--
his
rights
might
be
impaired
if
--
if
it
stood
all
by
itself.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
that
is
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
it
would.
in
--
in
that
part
of
situation,
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
that
would.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
well,
in
this
particular
case,
as
i
understand
it
that
he
--
mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
see
it,
if
he
was
illegally
tried
and
convicted,
he
has
another
remedy.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
procedure
is
a
remedy
that
he
should
follow.
there
is
a
constitutional
provision
in
the
state
of
texas
which
allows
a
man
who
is
--
has
been
unlawfully
tried
and
convicted
and
--
and
then
one
who
is
tried
and
convicted
to
serve
a
sentence
to
go,
first
of
all,
to
get
a
pardon
from
the
governor.
if
he
has
served
time,
he
can
go
to
the
legislature
and
ask
the
--
and
have
someone
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
--
introduce
the
bill.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
well,
that's
true.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
--
but
that
is
a
procedure
that
he
has
to
follow
which
would
determine
first
of
all
whether
he
was
in
fact
convicted
of
a
crime
unjustly.
and
for
that
reason,
i'm
saying,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
--
in
this
particular
case,
he
has
come
up
here
under
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
i'm
saying
that
because
of
the
--
the
specific
points
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
cover,
that
is
one
who
is
in
confinement,
unlawful
confinement
can
be
released.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
that
--
and
--
because
he
is
no
longer
confined,
because
there
is
no
one
to
serve
the
writ
on
at
this
time
even
if
it
were
issued,
because
mr.
ellis
cannot
discharge
him
because
he
has
already
discharged
him.
so
therefore,
the
question
has
become
moot,
it
is
in
regard
to
the
habeas
corpus
procedure
possibly
not
moot
in
regard
to
some
other
legal
procedures
that
he
might
go
to,
to
clear
up
his
good
name
if
in
fact
he
was
not
tried
and
convicted
properly.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
i've
never
followed
--
i
had
occasion
to
try
a
case
of
that
power
to
use
a
procedure,
but
my
understanding,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
anyone
who
is
--
contends
that
he
was
unlawfully
convicted
or
served
time
can
by
himself
or
through
counsel
file
an
application
to
the
governor
and
ask
the
governor
to
pardon
me.
the
governor,
i
maybe
in
error
here,
but
it's
my
understanding
that
the
governor
asked
the
board
of
pardon
--
parole
to
investigate
it,
and
then
he
makes
a
determination.
he
also
has
a
right
to
--
if
he
is
--
from
the
evidence
adduced
at
the
hearing
that
he
was
unlawfully
convicted.
he
can
then,
in
a
served
time,
he
can
then
go
to
the
legislature
and
have
this
congress
--
representative
or
senator
introduce
legislation
saying
--
which
is
a
new
constitutional
provision
in
texas.
i
believe
it's
about
two
years
or
--
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
and
they
will
or
can,
i
won't
say
that
they
will,
i
say
that
they
can
grant
him
certain
amount
of
money
because
of
his
conviction
and
that
--
the
pardon
plus
that
certainly
would
clear
the
man's
name.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
he
has
a
right
to
do
this
but
it's
a
matter
of
determination
on
the
part
of
the
governor
in
one
hand
and
the
legislature
in
another,
whether
they
will
--
that
he
can
convince
them.
what
he
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
no,
sir.
no
--
no
judicial
proceeding
in
texas
by
which
he
can
do
it.
that
is
the
only
way
that
i
--
i
know
that
it
could
be
done.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
the
counsel
for
petitioner
here
has
argued
here
that
this
court
entered
a
nunc
pro
tunc
order
to
remove
this
so-called
stigma
from
the
record
of
this
individual.
there
is
no
occasion
that
i
can
recall
reading
that
a
nunc
pro
tunc
order
as
such
has
been
issued
or
--
by
this
court
in
a
habeas
corpus
procedure
as
such.
in
the
pollard
case,
it
was
discussed
but
it
went
off
on
another
theory
and
it
was
not
introduced
or
was
not
granted.
in
summing
up,
the
respondent's
position
that
on
the
question
of
mootness,
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
gained
at
this
time
by
the
court
granting
a
writ
because
there
is
no
restraint.
it
is
our
position
that
some
type
of
restraint
must
lie
before
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
can
issue.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
no,sir.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
he
is
discharged
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
he
has
been
discharged.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
the
--
the
--
there
was
a
question
raised
this
morning.
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
believe
in
regard
to
--
if
he
were
retried
again
and
say,
for
instance,
he
--
i
believe
the
question
was
if
it'd
be
--
writ
was
issued
and
granted.
he
went
back
and
it
was
determined
that
he
was
not
lagally
tried,
then
it
would
go
back
to
the
trial
court.
what
repercussion
would
that
be?
they
could
retry
--
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
they
could
retry
him.
it
would
be
up
to
the
court.
it'd
be
up
to
the
judge
to
determine
whether
he
would
grant
him
good
time
or
grant
him
the
time
that
he
has
already
served,
but
i
think
that
would
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
because
he
was
the
one
that
set
the
wheels
in
motion
to
get
his
trial,
his
case
reversed.
so
i
would
say
that
in
our
probability,
that
the
trial
judge
would
allow
this
time
that
he
has
served
and
be
credited
on
the
--
the
amount
of
time
that
the
--
the
jury
could
give
but
it
would
be
within
his
discretion.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
that
is
my
view.
yes,
sir.
i
know
at
the
time
that
i
was
a
county
attorney,
we
used
to
--
when
someone
was
--
our
grand
juries
met
every
six
months.
someone
might
have
been
arrested
right
or
maybe
four
or
five
months
before
the
grand
jury
would
meet
and
have
to
stay
because
he
could
make
a
bond.
the
trial
judge
after
--
the
jury
return
its
sentence
would,
could
and
often
did
grant
him
the
amount
saying
it
was
three
months
or
four
months,
he
could
that
because
that
was
within
his
discretion.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
no,
sir,
i
don't.
i
--
i
think
that
in
going
into
the
--
the
case,
first
of
all,
whether
the
petitioner
here
was
denied
due
process,
as
--
i
differ
very
strongly
with
petitioner
in
his
--
in
his
briefs
and
in
his
application.
the
record
discloses
and
throughout
that
his
contends
that
he
was
denied
due
process
mainly
for
two
reasons,
one
that
he
was
denied
counsel
and
he
stated
in
his
application
for
habeas
corpus
that
he
asked
the
court
for
counsel
which
was
promptly
refused.
then
he
states
that
he
was
denied
a
motion,
his
motion
was
denied
for
a
continuance
because
of
ill
health
or
illness.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
the
transcript
of
the
entire
record
from
the
first
word
to
the
last
that
he
asked
for
either
one
of
these.
so
therefore,
the
question
of
whether
he
knew
that
--
what
his
rights
were
to
ask
for
counsel.
now,
as
mr.
chief
justice
stated
that
there
--
never
was
properly
brought
before
the
court
that
he
was
tried
and
convicted
eight
different
times,
but
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
here,
the
report
shows
that
if
it
was
true,
the
man
was
no
novice
in
the
court
--
in
the
courtroom
procedure.
he
--
the
eight
--
the
record
discloses
that
the
eight
offenses
that
he
was
tried
and
convicted
up
were
offenses
of
forgery
and
passing
hot
checks.
i
ventured
to
say
that
he
was
more
qualified
in
that
respect
as
to
any
possible
defenses
that
he
might
have
and
as
to
any
type
of
contentions
and
plans
of
defense
as
many
attorneys
might
have
themselves.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
mr.
--
mr.
justice,
i
have
found
that
to
be
that
some
of
the
students
of
the
criminal
law
are
in
our
penitentiaries.
they
come
in
or
referred
to
them
as
guardhouse
lawyers.
and
in
several
cases,
i
have
come
up
against
them
and
they
spend
their
time
well.
but
--
and
i
would
say
that
this
man
was
one
of
them.
i
think
that
this
was
a
premeditated
type
of
defense.
he
had
an
idea.
he
knew
from
past
experiences
what
it
would
take
to
convict
him.
he
considered
his
age.
he
considered
the
fact
that
he
was
ill.
and
he
--
he
thought
to
himself
that
they
--
they've
got
--
they've
got
me
on
the
low
but
maybe
i
can
attract
the
sympathy
of
the
jury.
the
fact
that
he
went
there
didn't
even
question
his
brother-in-law.
and
if
there
were
any
ill
feelings
among
the
family
circle,
he
would
have
brought
that
point
out.
he
sat
by
and
let
all
of
the
evidence
come
in.
he
had
a
right
as
--
as
the
trial
judge
in
his
certificate
stated
that
he
was
given
--
afforded
the
opportunity
to
first
of
all
talk
with
the
potential
jurors
in
the
voir
dire
that
he
had
a
right
to
challenge
the
jury,
that
he
was
given
that
and
informed
of
that
right
that
he
did
not
do
any
of
these
things.
then
the
only
thing
that
he
did,
when
he
got
up
there,
was
to
put
on
a
bunch
of
callings
to
say
that
he
was
ill
and
there's
no
denial,
possibly
he
was.
and
--
and
he
was
hoping
that
because
of
his
age
and
because
of
his
ill
health
that
the
--
that
the
jury
would
be
lenient
on
him,
which
might
have
been
a
good
defense
before
another
jury,
but
this
jury
just
didn't
buy
it.
and
now,
he
comes
before
this
honorable
court
and
asked
this
honorable
court
to
--
to
correct
his
mistaken
judgement.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
well,
under
whose
part?
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
well,
that
--
that
is
true.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
possibly
so.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
i
don't
see,
sir,
that
he
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
that's
true.
but
i
would
say
this
that
in
the
--
in
his
--
in
his
defense,
his
whole
idea
was
--
might
not
be
palpable
or
impalpable
to
an
attorney
who
is
experienced
in
the
law.
i'll
--
i'll
say
that
it
wasn't
that
complete
ignorance
that
the
case
that
--say
for
instance,
betts
versus
brady.
the
rule
that
this
court
has
laid
down
there
where
there
is
complete
ignorance,
say,
because
of
age,
maybe
too
young,
inexperienced,
complicated
nature
of
the
trial,
the
complicated
nature
of
defense,
any
possible
defenses
that
he
could
use.
he
was
unable
to
comprehend
any
of
that.
it
does
not
come
within
this
case.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
no,
sir,
i
don't.
but
under
the
rule
that
this
court
has
laid
down,
i
say
that
he
was
not
--
he
wasn't
that
ignorant
that
he
had
certain
rights.
he
didn't
ask
for,
your
honor,
he
did
not
ask
for
a
counsel
and
yet
there's
one
thing
that
he
did
have,
i
will
say,
sufficient
intellect
to
do
and
that
was
to
ask
for
an
attorney
or
that
he
was
sick,
he
could
have
said
so,
but
he
did
not
do.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
quattlebaum,
quattlebaum
by
--
which
was
the
--
his
mother-in-law
by
his
brother-in-law,
elzie
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
i
don't
believe
that
the
record
shows,
mr.
justice
black,
that
he
lives
in
town.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
i
don't
--
i
believe
it
was
in
the
town
near
there.
it
--
it
wasn't
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
she
did
not
testify,
but
the
brother-in-law
who
did.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
the
brother-in-law,
his
brother-in-law,
who
--
whose
name
also
appeared
on
the
check.
it
was
--
as
i
recall,
the
mother-in-law's
name
by
his
brother
--
his
mother-in-law's
name
on
top
by
his
brother-in-law
and
both
--
it
was
alleged
that
it
was
a
forgery.
and
that
the
brother-in-law,
elzie
is
the
one
that
testified
in
the
case.
the
mother
--
his
mother-in-law
had
first
name
on
the
--
appeared
on
that
she
did
not
testify.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
this
is
recently,
yes.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
but
prior
to
that
time
under
which
this
--
at
the
time
that
the
trial
was
conducted,
at
the
time
that
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
--
he
made
his
appeal.
do
you
understand?
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
it
was
different.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
to
counsel.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
on
a
suspended
sentence.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
and
then
the
purpose
of
appointing
counsel
was
to
--
to
assist
him
in
making
the
application,
but
it
was
not
the
law
of
the
state
of
texas
except
in
capital
cases
that
he
had
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
--
to
have.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
it
is.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
no,
sir.
i
don't.
i
--
i
don't.
i
think
it
--
the
fact
that
they
--
it
can
be
weighed
makes
me
--
there
are
many
cases
that
is
not
necessary,
but
i
think
that
it's
--
it's
good.
well,
i
have
no
--
no
quarrel
with
our
legislature
in
that
regard,
sir.
but
as
far
as
the
denial
of
due
process
is
concerned
and
in
regard
to
the
question
that
you
just
asked,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
the
--
there's
--
there's
no
--
i
mean
the
--
the
law
asserted
by
this
court
in
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
--
the
states
may
themselves
prescribe
their
own
procedures
in
accordance
with
its
ideas
in
the
most
inefficient
administration
of
criminal
justice.
this
along,
as
in
doing
so,
a
man
is
not
deprived
of
due
process.
now,
there
was
a
case
of
adamson
versus
california
where
the
question
came
before
this
court
where
the
accused
was
--
the
prosecution
commented
upon
the
failure
of
the
accused
to
testify.
and
this
court
said
that
that
would
not
in
itself
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
and
also,
in
wolf
versus
colorado,
where
evidence
obtained
by
illegal
search
and
seizure
was
admitted
into
evidence,
this
court
held
that
it
would
--
that'd
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
then
gallegos
versus
nebraska
where
a
confession
was
admitted
into
evidence,
where
the
defendant
was
not
given
an
appearance
or
an
arraignment.
in
that
case,
the
court
says
that
they
all
--
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not
prevent
a
state
from
allowing
the
prosecution
to
comment
on
the
evidence
or
this
evidence
--
this
other
type
of
evidence
coming
in.
it
says
unlike
the
specific
requirements
and
restriction
placed
by
the
bill
of
rights
upon
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
by
federal
authority,
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
subject
criminal
justice
in
the
states
to
specific
limitations.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
it
--
mr.
chief
justice,
what
went
on
at
the
trial,
i
--
i
don't
know.
but
i
do
know
this
that
first
of
all
an
objection
must
be
made
to
the
introduction
of
such
a
confession
by
the
--
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
if
you
might
conceive
it
to
be
that
there
was
some
--
he
--
he
might've
wanted
you
to
come
in.
i
mean
there's
a
possibility
i
can't
proceed
in
this
particular
case.
he
did
not
object
to
it.
he
--
he
also
have
to
show
that
a
confession
must
be
made
after
the
man
was
arrested
and
was
in
confinement,
that
wasn't
brought
out.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
the
--
the
record
does
not
clearly
show
that.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
if
that
would
be
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
sir?
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
i
do
not
know,
sir,
as
to
what
really
went
on.
i
suppose
that
it
was
given
to
him
at
the
time
at
--
while
he
was
arrested,
but
the
record
does
not
show
that.
so
that's
the
reason
i'm
--
i'm
saying
that.
i
--
it
could've
been
mentioned
prior
to
that
time.
i
do
know
that
even
in
his
own
application
here
that
he
had
--
he
had
mentioned
--he
admits
that
he
told
the
sheriff
that
he
was
guilty
of
writing
some
checks
and
i
don't
be
there
in
regard
to
this
particular
case.
but
he
makes
certain
admissions.
he
admits
that
he
is
--
in
his
petition
that
he
is
guilty
of
passing
a
forged
instrument,
but
now,
he
says
he's
not
guilty,
but
he
is
not
guilty
of
forgery.
but
the
facts
of
this
case
is
--
is,
honestly,
it
--
are
--
are
two
--
first
of
all,
he
was
not
as
lay
down
by
this
court.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
he
was
not
denied
due
process,
as
that
term
has
been
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
rules
formerly
betts
versus
brady.
he
did
not
urge
that
at
his
time
of
his
trial
that
he
was
denied
right
of
counsel.
he
didn't
ask
for
it.
this
case
--
the
--
in
mckenna
versus
the
state,
this
court
had
held
that
it's
denial
of
due
process
to
appoint
an
attorney
where
he's
not
--
where
he's
not
wanted.
here,
the
man
did
ask
for
one
and
he
didn't
get.
he
didn't
get
counsel
to
defend
him.
he
did
not
urge
as
he
contends
in
his
petition
that
he
was
sick.
there's
a
statement
in
the
--
in
the
trial
here
and
in
the
statement
of
facts
that
by
the
judge
who
said
that
he
was
afforded
every
fair
opportunity
that
the
--
many
of
the
things
that
he
alleged
here
just
didn't
happen
as
the
record
clearly
discloses.
it
is
not
attacked
--
the
record
that
the
person
taking
the
record
did
not
put
everything
in
there.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
that's
true.
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
there's
a
difference
in
being
--
in
failing
health
and
--
and
being
sick
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
a
man
can
be
feeling
by
at
all
of
the
time.
but
i
mean
you
could
be
much
more
or
ill
a
whole
lot
more
at
one
time,
you
see,
at
the
time
of
trial
that
he
just
couldn't
go,
and
the
man
is
suffering
from
a
heart
--
heart
disease
and
he
gets
around.
the
facts
in
this
case
show
that
he
did
conduct
some
type
of
defense
and
that
he
had
an
idea
in
mind
--
he
didn't
indicate
or
doesn't
indicate
that
he
was
sick
at
the
time
of
his
trial.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
on
his
--
on
his
appeal
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
sir?
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
it
was
on
--
on
his
motion
for
new
trial,
he
urged
that
he
was
denied
right
to
counsel.
then
on
appeal,
he
urged
that
--
in
addition
--
i
take
it
by
--
then
on
appeal,
he
did
not
urge
either
one,
but
then
on
his
first
motion
or
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
he
urged
that
he
was
denied
right
of
counsel
and
that
he
was
sick
at
the
time
of
his
trial.
it
was
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
he
--
i
--
i
really
don't
know,
sir.
the
--
the
record
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
he
did
not
urge
that
he
was
denied
counsel
or
that
he
asked
for
counsel.
he
did
not
urge
that
he
was
deprived
to
continue
because
he
was
in
ill
health.
he
did
not
urge
those.
he
did
not
have
an
attorney
at
the
time
that
he
appealed
and
the
court
just
affirmed
the
--
the
trial.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
just
denied
his
application
for
habeas
corpus.
he
did
urge
both
at
that
time.
that
was
the
first
time
--
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
they
didn't
write
on
it,
sir.
it
--
i
believe
it
is
right
in
this,
not
only
on
the
case,
there's
nothing
more
than
denying
his
--
his
motion.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
no,
sir.
and
then
he
again
raised
both
questions
at
the
time
that
he
filed
his
application
for
writ
in
the
federal
district
court
of
houston.
but
it
is
our
contention
again
that
the
question
here
is
a
moot
question
and
that
--
that
waving
our
mootness
that
even
so
that
he
was
not
denied
due
process
at
his
--
at
his
trial
and
we
asked
that
this
court
either
dismiss
the
writ
or
affirm
the
decision
of
the
appellate
court
of
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
leon
f.
pesek
thank
you,
sir.
