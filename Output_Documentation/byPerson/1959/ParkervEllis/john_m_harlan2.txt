did
the
judge
--
the
time
it
were
directed,
did
the
judge
--
did
the
judge
take
any
important
stuff
in
the
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
request
by
the
petitioner
that
he
wanted
counsel
like
other
counsel
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

from
the
judge
as
to
whether
he
wanted
that
with
the
request
not
have
counsel.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
would
be
on
this
colloquy,
is
able
to
give
you
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
going
to
deal
with
mootness
before
you
get
through?
that's
what
it
is.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
mootness
--
i
call
its
jurisdiction.
i'm
thinking
about
mootness
in
the
sentence
as
to
whether
he
can
be
denied
his
voting
rights
in
texas
and
should
be
on
a
continuing
consonance
to
that,
is
he?
in
view
of
that
case
it
cited
that
there
are
things
to
indicate
that
an
out-of-state
conviction
will
deprive
in
his
voting
rights.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
then
a
texas
voting
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
is
that
your
law
in
texas?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
statue
itself
have
some
construction,
in
other
words
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
this
is
a
study,
the
record
shows,
a
study
of
--
of
incompetence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
defendant's
part.
certainly,
any
lawyer
who
is,
in
this
record
--
any
lawyer
who
is
representing
him
would
not
allow
that
stuff
go
in
--
go
in.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
hypothesis
that
he
was
an
experienced
fellow
as
a
result
of
his
prior
life,
i
should
think
you
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
studied
piece
of
strategy.
