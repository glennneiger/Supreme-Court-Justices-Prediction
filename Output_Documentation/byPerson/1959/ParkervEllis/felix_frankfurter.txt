can
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
could
you
tell
us
what
there
is
behind
--
what
policy
or
consideration
behind
this
special
rule
in
texas
that
it'd
be
--
wants
to
have
a
--
suspend
the
sentence
then
he
can
have
a
lawyer
after
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
justification
but
somebody
must
have
had
some
reason
to
get
something
like
that
on
the
statute.
is
it
on
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
merely
whether
that
court
has
lost
jurisdiction
with
whether
this
court
has
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
cases
are
those?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
had
a
case
of
the
case
of
an
abatement
because
of
the
judge
advocate
general
(inaudible),
do
you
remember
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
didn't
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
ultimately,
those
are
cases
where
the
cause
of
action,
where
there
was
an
--
an
act
--
an
action
still
alive,
it
wasn't
that
the
action
was
terminated
with
one
of
the
parties
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
you
--
and
you
hope
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
hope
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
the
only
way
to
clear
it,
is
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
this
is
the
only
way
to
clear
it,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
--
your
argument
is
one
draft
on
nunc
pro
tunc,
makes
finding
specific
disability
resulting
from
this
to
be
rather
immaterial,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
main
argument
makes
this
immaterial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
a
mootness
question
hasn't
arisen,
suppose
your
position
of
due
process
was
sustained,
what
would
be
the
judgment
of
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
dismissing?
you
mean
the
state
couldn't
retrial
there
would
be
no
mootness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
could
not
retrial?
even
defined
in
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
rearrest,
retrial
him
on
the
old
indictment.
that's
what
happened
in
all
these
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
might
be
arrested
but
they
would
retrial
him
on
the
old
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
the
same
thing
was
happening
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
claim
is
that
it
isn't
moot
because
of
the
stigma
hangs
over.
now,
why
--
why
should
texas
be
deprived
of
proving
the
free
of
constitutional
infirmities
and
questions
that
a
stigma
should
hang
over
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
now
talking
about
the
sentence,
i'm
talking
about
the
--
the
claim
on
which
you
say
we
should
disregard
a
habeas
corpus
could
not
act
in
a
(inaudible)
on
a
body
that
isn't
there,
should
act
on
a
body
that
isn't
there.
would
--
is
there
anything
to
stop
texas
from
proving
if
this
person
was
rightly
convicted
on
a
certain
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
there
could
be
a
new
trial
in
this
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
the
upside
of
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
account
shouldn't
given
of
what
account
should
be
given
at
the
time
he
has
served.
i'm
talking
about
the
basis
of
your
argument
that
we
should
enter
a
nunc
pro
tunc
order
because
of
stigma
hangs
over
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
state
of
texas
was
deciding
to
prove
that
a
stigma
should
hang
over
it.

(voice

mitchell
case
and
that's
wholly
different
from
this
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
a
case
--
that
was
a
civil
action
in
the
courts
of
iowa.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
plaintiff
brought
a
damage
suit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
against
the
defendant
before
there
was
a
judgment
on
their
claim
for
damages.
the
plaintiff
died
and
instead
of
doing
what
on
the
iowa
law
could
be
done
when
it's
authorized
to
be
done
adding
a
survival
proceeding,
they
went
ahead
and
decided
the
merits.
the
question
then
came
up
in
this
court
on
whether
that
was
a
void
judgment
in
iowa,
which
is
a
case
different
from
this
to
me
as
nights
and
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
operate
in
that
case
by
entering
$5123
judgment
that
was
involved
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
can't
operate
here
because
it
can't
release
somebody
who
isn't
under
detention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
it
--
century
old,
the
clerical
errors
of
the
states
or
insubstantial
things
not
touching
the
cause
of
action,
not
touching
but
it's
the
cause
of
action
before
the
court
and
the
remedy
asked,
and
that's
the
iowa
case.
it
would
be
really
a
question
of
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

what
i'm
saying
of
--
of
--
things
of
that
nature
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
think
just
as
they
said
in
iowa,
they
simply
would
have
to
substitute
the
--
the
survival,
the
next
representative
or
whoever
he
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
made
a
thorough
study
knowing
you
as
i
do.
is
there
a
single
case
dealing
with
habeas
corpus
in
which
what
you
suggest
was
done
in
the
federal
system?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sure
you
have
followed
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
difficulty
is
in
--
to
express
my
difficulty
using
the
word
“declaration”.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
indulgent
--
shouldn't
be
indulgent
declarations
when
it
can't
truthfully
operate
on
the
state
of
facts
before
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
that
follows
the
matter
of
course.
