mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
i
can
answer
one
of
the
questions
which
mr.
justice
clark
just
asked
by
reading
the
document
which
was
written
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
i
can
find
it
here.
there
were
four
points
that
he
--
that
he
brought
up
in
that
or
--
in
that
order,
sir,
when
he
--
when
he
denied
habeas
corpus.
it
says
here
that
it
was
admitted
in
printing
in
the
place
where
i
was
looking
for
it,
but
i
think
it's
somewhere
else
as
well.
one
point
was
that
he
had
not
properly
shown
that
the
--
that
he
--
we
needed
counsel.
another
was
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
that
he
did
not
raise
the
question
of
his
illness
correctly
because
he
did
not
ask
for
a
motion
of
continuance.
the
contention
that
george
lee
parker
is
so
experienced
in
his
trials
that
he
needed
no
lawyer.
the
contention
that
his
defense
was
premeditated.
the
contention
that
appears
at
page
13
of
respondent's
brief
that
it
was
only
in
the
quite
confines
of
his
jail
cell
that
he
first
realized
that
he's
plan
of
defense
had
failed.
founder
upon
this
record.
the
contention
of
respondent
that
this
man
was
not
denied
due
process.
founders
upon
his
admission
that
this
man
was
not
competent
to
conduct
his
own
trial
and
that
indeed
no
layman
in
any
matter
this
intricate
can
hope
to
conduct
competently
his
own
trial.
the
critique
procedures
which
respondent
has
suggested
that
parker
can
go
to
a
legislature
for
relief
and
can
go
to
the
governor
for
relief
and
make
it
more
imperative,
not
less
that
this
court
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
how
can
this
man
hope
for
any
hearing
from
the
legislature
or
from
the
governor
in
the
face
of
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
under
the
normal
circumstances,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
believe
that
this
court
should
have
reversed
and
--
and
vacated
the
judgments
below
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
the
entry
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
dismissing
this
man.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
well,
dismissing
the
man
from
--
from
the
penitentiary,
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
if
i
want
to
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
if
they
want
to
rearrest
him,
they
can.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
well,
yes,
sir.
but
i
have
thought
that
that
occurred
by
--
by
taking
him
back
into
the
court
in
numerous
county
and
letting
him
out
of
the
penitentiary.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
that's
very
possible,
sir.
witnesses
were
still
available
and
they
still
wish
to
press
the
charge.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
well,
under
these
circumstances,
sir,
of
course,
he
already
is
out
of
custody.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
your
honor,
i'm
not
claiming
that
they
shouldn't
be
entitled
to
do
it
if
they
want
to,
but
if
after
he's
already
served
one
full
sentence
for
one
crime
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
however,
it
was
the
result
of
that
trial
he
was
convicted
and
was
sentenced.
i
submit
that
if
--
if
double
jeopardy
prevents
two
trials
for
the
same
case
that
certainly
due
process
should
prevent
having
deserve
two
sentences
for
the
same
case.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
i
will
not
quarrel
with
that
statement,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
in
this
instance,
they
failed
to
do
so.
and
i
believe
that
--
as
mr.
pesek
has
said,
there
is
no
judicial
procedure
in
texas
for
him
to
prove
so.
and
that
is
why
i
think
it's
very
important
for
this
court
to
make
that
statement.
now,
i
have
suggested
the
method
of
a
habeas
corpus
writ
issued
nunc
pro
tunc.
this
is
a
suggested
form
of
relief
which
i
propose.
i
certainly
feel
that
petitioner
and
certainly
i
would
be
entirely
satisfied
with
any
other
form
of
relief
which
this
--
this
court
considers
more
appropriate.
but
i
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
well,
it's
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
well,
your
honor,
to
me,
the
same
principles
apply.
the
question
is
whether
they're
--
the
--
the
court
has
lost
jurisdiction
there
by
reason
of
the
death
of
one
of
the
parties.
in
this
instance,
i
believe,
the
question
is
whether
the
court
has
lost
jurisdiction
by
reason
of
the
release
of
the
prisoner.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
nunc
pro
tunc.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
well,
i'm
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
when
it
asks
that
the
man
be
released,
it
can
even
be
as
of
the
date
when
he
actually
was
released.
any
day
that
he
was
in
custody,
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
do
so.
and
whether
it
chooses
to
do
so
or
not
is
of
course
entirely
the
prerogative
of
this
court.
but
i
believe
that
the
same
principle
applies.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
well,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
regard
that
as
merely
a
clerical
error.
it
seems
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
that
is
true,
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
the
doctrine
of
nunc
pro
tunc
certainly
has
been
used
to
collect
--
is
to
correct
clerical
errors,
but
it
also
has
been
used
to
correct
judgments
--
not
to
correct
judgments,
to
enter
judgments
which
have
not
been
entered.
and
this
court
has
entered
no
judgment
now
--
in
this
case.
now,
in
harris
versus
commissioner
in
340
u.s.,
nunc
pro
tunc
was
used
by
this
court
after
the
death
of
the
commissioner
to
avoid
abatement.
in
quon
quon
poy
versus
johnson
which
was
mentioned
earlier,
nunc
pro
tunc
was
used
to
enter
a
judgment
which
had
never
been
entered
and
which
indeed
reversed
--
no,
it
didn't
reverse,
it
--
it
affirmed
and
remanded
that
man.
but
there
again,
it
was
the
entry
of
a
judgment
not
the
correction
of
--
of
a
clerical
error.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
the
--
the
only
habeas
corpus
case
which
i
have
found,
sir,
is
quon
quon
poy
which
was
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
but
i
do
believe
that
--
that
did
constitute
a
case.
harris
does
constitute
a
case
where
this
court
has
entered
a
judgment
after
the
death
of
a
party
which
otherwise
would
have
subjected
the
decision
to
--
the
case
to
abatement.
and
i'm
asking
here,
sir,
that
the
same
theory
be
applied.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
your
honor,
i
believe
pollard
versus
the
united
states
is
in
point
in
its
declaration
that
there
--
there
is
a
possibility
of
continuing
legal
consequences
and
that
these
are
sufficiently
substantial
to
justify
your
dealing
with
the
merits.
and
i
believe
that
the
pollard
case
although
it
happens
to
involved
article
2255,
your
honor's
conquering
opinion
in
the
heflin
case
concurred
in
by
four
other
justices
equates
the
matter
of
custody
as
far
as
225
--
2255
is
concerned
and
as
far
as
2241
is
concerned.
i
would
hope
therefore
that
this
man
may
also
obtain
a
review
on
the
merits
which
pollard
obtained.
now,
if
there
is
some
other
method
by
which
--
if
--
if
the
court
doesn't
happen
to
like
nunc
pro
tunc
or
it
doesn't
think
it's
applicable,
if
they
prefer
to
say
that
there
is
a
continuing
constructive
custody
because
of
the
degree
to
which
this
man's
civil
liberties
are
restrained,
that
will
leave
us
to
say
be
entirely
satisfactory
to
--
to
petitioner
because
what
we
believe
is
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
declaration
that
his
conviction
was
unconstitutionally
obtained.
now,
if
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
well
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
i
would
regard
this
as
a
decision,
sir,
which
would
have
in
it
a
declaration
but
would
also
be
a
decision
and
indeed
an
order
issued
as
of
a
date
when
the
man
was
in
custody.
but
i
repeat
that
the
--
that
the
main
thing
that
we're
after
is
a
recognition
here
that
his
conviction
was
unconstitutionally
obtained.
now,
if
this
court
does
feel
that
the
case
is
now
moot,
then
i
believe
its
course
is
clear
under
duke
power
company
versus
greenwood
under
u.s.
versus
munsingwear,
this
court
should
vacate
the
judgments
of
the
two
courts
below
not
leaving
them
standing
to
spawn
adverse
legal
consequences
as
mr.
justice
douglas
mentioned
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
munsingwear
case
and
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
dismissal
as
moot.
thereby,
at
least
wiping
out
the
federal
stamp
of
approval
which
to
this
day
rests
upon
this
conviction.
now,
i
believe
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
of
his
application.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
vacation
of
--
of
the
judgment
and
dismissal
of
his
application
as
moot,
his
application
for
habeas
corpus.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
the
federal
case
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
i
believe
that
would,
sir.
if
--
if
this
court
does
not
feel
that
there
are
continuing
consequences
which
warrant
its
decision.
i
hope
that
the
court
will
feel
that
there
are.
i
believe
that
merely
wiping
out
erroneous
precedents,
desirable
though
that
may
be
is
no
substitute
for
creating
a
correct
precedent
which
can
guide
the
future
courts
and
future
decisions
including
the
learned
judges
of
the
fifth
circuit.
and
certainly
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
as
to
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
mr.
justice
stewart,
as
far
as
the
--
as
--
these
people
who
are
still
to
come
to
trial,
i
think
the
legislature
--
legislature's
enactment
does
cure
it.
in
terms
of
those
who
are
presently
imprisoned,
i
would
hope
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
find
the
moore
situation
applicable.
but
the
moore
case
was
reversed
on
appeal
and
not
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
we
have
not
yet
seen
what
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
will
do
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
under
--
under
that
circumstance,
sir,
i
believe
the
appropriate
order
would
be
either
to
issue
a
writ
to
yourself
or
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
a
--
an
order
to
be
issued
by
it
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
well,
if
you
do
it
on
that
ground,
it's
little
hard
to
say
--
to
say
what
and
that's
one
of
my
reasons
for
suggesting
the
method
of
--
of
a
habeas
corpus
nunc
pro
tunc
because
we're
talking
here
about
respondent
ellis,
the
general
manager
of
the
texas
prison
system
and
he,
of
course,
is
the
state
of
texas
as
is
evidenced
by
the
present
here
--
presence
here
of
my
learned
opponent.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
your
honor,
i
certainly
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
do
so.
there
maybe
some
other
form
of
order
which
this
court
would
regard
as
more
appropriate,
but
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
form
which
i've
suggested
in
my
brief.
the
very
availability
of
the
legislative
remedies
and
of
pardon
as
is
now
sought
are
the
factors
which
certainly
as
far
as
this
individual
petitioner
is
concerned
do
mean
that
a
definite
function
will
be
served
by
having
his
unconstitutional
conviction
is
--
his
conviction
held
unconstitutional
because
then
obviously
his
position
in
going
to
the
governor
for
a
pardon
or
particularly
to
the
legislature
for
compensation,
and
i
assure
you,
that's
not
that
he
is
interested
in,
would
be
vastly
improved
by
a
recognition
that
the
decision
was
unconstitutional,
whereas
in
the
present
state
of
the
record,
there
is
just
the
reverse
determination
by
the
federal
courts.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
there
can
be
no
better
last
word
on
this
topic
than
to
recognize
again
that
we
have
more
before
this
bar,
before
this
court
than
george
lee
parker.
we
have
george
lee
parker
and
he's
here
and
i
believe
his
rights
are
effective.
but
as
we
said
by
this
court
recently
in
another
case,
the
true
proponent
before
this
court
is
the
constitution.
it
has
been
violated
in
this
case
by
the
state
of
texas.
it
is
an
honor
for
me
to
defend
it.
and
i
hope
that
this
court
will
decide
in
favor
of
it.
thank
you.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
thank
you,
sir.
