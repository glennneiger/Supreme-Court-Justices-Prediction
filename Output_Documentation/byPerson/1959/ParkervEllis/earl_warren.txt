george

petitioner,
versus
o.
b.
ellis,
general
manager
of
texas
prison
system.
mr.
wozencraft.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
time
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
may
i
ask
before
you
get
to
that?
what
is
the
significance
of
this
statement
if
you
want
to
apply
for
a
suspended
sentence,
you
let
me
know
and
i'll
arrange
for
a
lawyer
to
help
you
with
that
part
only?
is
that
--
is
that
implied
with
--
he
can
have
a
lawyer
if
he
pleads
guilty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
can
only
come
either
after
he's
convicted
by
a
jury
or
after
he
pleads
guilty,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
authorizing
or
requiring
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
all
the
cases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
there
been
any
clause
you
could
--
on
that
section
by
the
courts
prior
to
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
old
was
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pesek.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
pesek.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pesek,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
looses
rights
in
some
other
--
other
state
of
the
union
or
under
the
federal
government
by
reason
of
this
conviction,
would
you
still
say
that
it
was
moot?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
--
let's
take
it
one
at
a
time.
let's
just
take
a
--
a
defendant
who
is
--
who
is
convicted
under
the
circumstances
that
this
man
was
convicted
and
--
and
is
in
the
present
shape
that
he's
in,
leave
out
the
other
convictions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
really
that's
the
question
where
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
where
not
--
there's
--
there's
no
proof
of
all
this
--
this
man
of
his
other
convictions.
no
proof
that
he
had
been
pardoned
for
them.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
as
so
that,
is
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
know.
but
i
mean
so
far
as
proof
is
concerned
against
him
on
those
issue
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
there
is
nothing
--
nothing
of
that
kind
in
your
record.
so
let's
just
take
--
so
this
was
a
second
conviction,
what
--
what
would
you
say
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
--
maybe
in
the
state
of
--
of
iowa,
for
instance,
conviction
of
this
kind
might
bar
him
there
even
though
your
--
your
statute
might
be
otherwise.
if
he
wanted
to
vote
in
iowa,
then
he
had
this
illegal
conviction
against
him,
he
couldn't
vote
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
can
that
be
a
disability?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
told
that
--
as
my
understanding
that
--
that
the
secretary
of
state
has
--
has
the
right
to
prevent
a
man
from
traveling
out
of
this
country
if
he's
--
if
he's
convicted
of
a
felony.
that
would
be
quite
a
disability
to
many
people,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
--
i
have
no
doubt
if
we
went
through
the
votes
so
we
could
find
a
good
many
other
situations
where
a
man
might
loose
very
substantial
rights
by
--
by
virtue
of
a
conviction
of
this
kind
if
it
was
not
set
aside,
and
if
it's
--
if
it's
constitutional
infirmity
in
the
case,
and
he
was
in
prison
when
he
came
here,
why
--
why
shouldn't
he
provided
to
adjudicate
it
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
not
a
right.
it's
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
which
--
i
think
i
stopped
you
when
you
started.
tell
me
what
--
what
procedure
he
might
follow
in
texas.
would
you
--
would
do
that
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
aren't
those
all
acts
of
grace
and
not
--
and
not
matters
of
right
that
he
has
to
clear
his
--
to
clear
his
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
judicial
proceeding
in
texas
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
which
he
can
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask,
mr.
pesek,
in
your
--
in
your
state,
when
a
man
gets
a
seven-year
sentence
and
--
and
is
given
two
years
off
for
--
for
good
behavior,
is
that
two
years
now
over
in
the
talk
after
he
goes
out
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
he
--
he's
discharged
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he's
finally
discharged
and
this
man
has
been
discharged.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
pesek,
as
--
on
the
question
of
whether
the
man
was
competent
to
--
to
conduct
his
own
defense,
it
is
the
policy
of
your
state
now,
is
it
not?
let
--
no
one
is
competent
to
conduct
his
own
defense
and
that
he
is
entitled
to
--
to
have
counsel
appointed
for
him
no
matter
what
his
--
his
status
is.
no
matter
how
educated
he
is,
no
matter
whether
he
is
a
lawyer
or
--
or
a
convict
or
whatever
he
is.
if
he's
charged
with
a
felony,
he's
entitled
--
he's
entitled
to
have
a
counsel
appointed
for
him,
that's
a
policy
of
your
state,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suspended,
he
was
entitled
only
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
a
suspended
sentence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
now
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
is.
do
you
quarrel
with
that
principle?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pesek,
in
this
case,
i
--
counsel
pointed
out
in
fact
that
although
you
have
a
--
a
statute
which
prohibits
the
use
of
a
--
a
confession
unless
it
is
taken
in
a
certain
way
that
you're
--
you're
sharing
when
this
man
was
not
represented
by
--
by
counsel
and
in
all
probability,
did
not
know
that
law
took
the
stands
and
that
the
instance
of
a
prosecution
testified
to
a
confession
contrary
to
that
statute.
do
you
--
do
you
not
think
that
goes
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
this
man
was
in
jail
at
that
time
when
the
sheriff
talked
to
him,
was
he
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
--
what
is
the
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
sheriff
himself
said
he
was
sick,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wozencraft.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wozencraft,
before
you
sit
down,
i
would
like
to
express
the
appreciation
of
the
court
to
you
for
the
earnest
manner
in
which
you
have
represented
the
interest
of
this
indigent
defendant
on
our
assignment.
it
always
gives
the
court
greater
pride
in
our
profession
and
also
that
it
comforts
so
far
as
the
administration
of
justice
is
concerned
when
members
of
the
bar
like
yourself
are
willing
to
undertake
these
assignments
without
compensation
and
willing
to
give
your
time
and
effort
to
come
here
and
represent
him.
thank
you
very
much.
we
appreciate
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pesek,
may
i
also
say
to
you,
sir,
that
we
appreciate
the
very
earnest,
the
very
able
and
--
and
diligent
manner
in
which
you
protect
the
rights
of
your
--
of
your
state
and
also
for
your
frankness
in
dealing
with
us.
