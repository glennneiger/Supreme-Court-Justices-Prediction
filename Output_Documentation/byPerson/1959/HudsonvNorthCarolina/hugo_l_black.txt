how
did
it
happen
to
get
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.

mr.
moody,
we
held
in
several
cases
in
the
federal
court
that
--
and
one
of
them
was
johnson
against
the
united
states
that
where
a
defendant
attempts
to
take
an
appeal
in
forma
and
the
district
court
certifies
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
take
his
appeal,
that
under
the
doctrine
of
johnson
against
zerbst,
the
court
was
required
to
appoint
an
attorney
for
him.
do
you
think
that
would
have
any
relevance
here
in
considering
the
question
on
either
one
of
the
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
see
whether
or
not
with
the
--
he
challenge
--
he
wants
to
challenge
the
certificate.
the
court
--
the
district
court
certifies
that
he
does
not
have
any
meritorious
ground
of
appeal.
and
he
testifies.
he
has
filed
an
affidavit.
he
has
no
money
to
get
a
counsel.
and
we
held
that
when
that
one
challenges
that
certification,
certification,
the
aid
of
counsel
unless
he
insist
on
being
his
own
must
be
given
him
under
johnson
versus
zerbst.
justice
hugo

that
was
352
u.s.565
and
566.
and
we've
followed
that
in
several
instances
with
reference
to
the
federal
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
that
argument
can
be
made.
of
course,
the
--
the
opinion
relied
on
and
the
case
relied
on
to
do
that
was
johnson
against
zerbst,
which,
as
i
recall
it,
was
put
on
constitutional
grounds.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
counsel
was
to
--
we
held
that
he
must
be
given
the
counsel,
appoint
a
counsel
when
he
challenged
the
certification
of
the
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
after
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
now,
you
--
you
grant
one
here
when
there's
a
constitutional
question
raised
in
north
carolina.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
there,
i
assume,
is
that
if
north
carolina
wants
to
draw
that
distinction
between,
the
right
to
counsel
after
conviction
may
--
he
seeks
to
set
it
aside
and
yet
denied
where
he's
being
tried
to
have
a
right
to
do
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
was
just
--
i
was
just
wondering
if
--
if,
as
a
practical
lawyer
and
with
practical
experience,
you
would
say
that
it's
a
normal
thing
to
say
that
a
man
needs
a
lawyer
worst
when
he
has
challenged
his
conviction
after
he's
been
tried
and
he
does
when
he's
being
tried.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'd
have
a
hard
time
defending
that
distinction
when
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
effect
it
might
have
on
the
constitutionality.
