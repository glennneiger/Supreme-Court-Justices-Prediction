mr.
ralph
moody
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
--
of
course,
i
prepared
this
case
upon
the
assumption
of
betts
against
brady.
it
was
still
the
law
and
i've
operated
on
that
plan
in
trying
to
consider
--
the
argument
in
this
case.
i
think,
really,
when
we
get
down
to
it
is
--
in
a
case
like
this,
it's
an
evaluation
of
the
record
and
of
the
proceedings
in
the
case
as
to
whether
fundamental
unfairness
was
committed
against
some
defendant
who
was
being
tried
in
the
state
courts
of
north
carolina.
in
other
words,
to
use
the
argot
phrase,
did
he
get
a
raw
deal
in
the
trial.
was
it
unfair?
mr.
ralph
moody
the
totality
of
it.
thus,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
the
trial
lead
us
to
a
feeling
or
a
conclusion
of
this
man
didn't
get
a
fair
trial,
that
he
was
fundamentally
wrong.
it
could
consist,
of
course,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
or
perhaps
one
act.
but
since
we're
all
in
the
point
now
about
the
plea,
one
of
the
--
the
counsel
david
cain
entered
pleas.
that's
--
that
is
common
practice
in
north
carolina,
but
--
but
for
a
group
of
men
who
are
indicted
and
represented
by
the
deputy
counsel.
one
in
open
court
enters
the
plea
if
he
wants
to
do
so.
and
in
our
jurisdiction,
that
has
been
held
not
to
be
a
ground
of
prejudice.
i
didn't
know
that
point
was
going
to
be
raised.
and
i
don't
think
he
raised
it
either,
but
i
am
prepared
to
show
that
by
the
authorities
in
my
state.
now,
i've
been
looking
to
see
where
this
man
is
--
got
along
so
--
was
treated
so
badly
in
this
trial.
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i've
been
waiting
that
for
a
long
time.
my
--
my
own
--
for
my
own
practice
--
my
own
experience
is
that
the
judges
are
very
--
appoint
counsel
in
felonies
a
good
many
times.
mr.
ralph
moody
no.
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
it's
not
--
i
haven't
seen
it.
that
--
that
--
i
--
i
would
like
to
leave
a
statement
that
i
have
seen
them
do
so
a
good
many
times
that
he,
as
mr.
counsel
has
stated
to
you,
there
is
no
statute
on
that.
of
course,
there
is.
it's
mandatory
in
the
capital
offenses,
but
there
is
no
statute
on
that
other
than
the
holdings
of
--
of
this
court
and
as
construed
by
our
court
in
(inaudible)
cases
which
came
up
here
on
the
same
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
sir.
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
answer
that
right
now,
but
it's
--
it's
been
there
a
long
time,
several
decades,
i'm
sure.
mr.
ralph
moody
as
i
recall,
the
statute
--
the
court
--
if
the
court
finds
that
he
doesn't
have
the
means
to
employ
counsel,
then
it
is
mandatory
for
him
to
appoint
counsel.
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
usually
about
what
is
done.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
the
court
makes
any
extensive
--
mr.
ralph
moody
--
investigation
about
such
thing.
i
think
that's
about
what
is
done.
usually,
it
alleges
that
as
apparent
right
to
the
institution
that
he
swears
too,
that
he
has
got
two
--
one
year
means
enough
to
do
that.
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
we
have
any
roster
or
legal
aid.
the
court
sees
--
knows
an
attorney.
the
judge
knows
the
members
of
his
bar
and
the
counties
he
goes
to
and
he
--
mr.
ralph
moody
how
is
that?
mr.
ralph
moody
most
of
our
counties
are
agricultural
counties.
that's
true.
mr.
ralph
moody
they
know
the
bar.
and
of
course,
that
statute,
post-conviction
statute,
that
statute
we
adopted,
that
was
adopted
apparently
it
have
to
do
with
illinois
statute.
and
i
think
that's
where
illinois
originally
--
and
that's
why
we
apply
it
now.
but
in
any
rate,
if
a
man
is
going
to
allege
that
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated,
it's
going
to
get
him
the
constitutional
law.
anyway,
there
might
have
been
thought
that
he
may
[laughs]
need
counsel
for
that.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
the
counties
--
the
counties
pay
it.
mr.
ralph
moody
it's
a
--
it's
a
bill
against
the
county
treasurer.
mr.
ralph
moody
there
is
no
authority,
but
i
know
of
no
legal
authority
to
--
for
the
county
to
pay
funds
or
state
--
state
our
counsel
on
this
particular
point.
mr.
ralph
moody
there
is
provision
to
the
same
effect,
a
provision
for
the
permanence
on
appeals
and
everything
that's
back.
there
is
provision
for
the
same
effect.
but
there
is
--
we
have
no
statute
in
the
non
--
in
the
noncapital
case.
we
have
no
statute
--
mr.
ralph
moody
(voice
overlap)
and
it's
just
simply
the
officer
is
a
lawyer.
he's
--
he's
an
officer
of
the
court
and
the
judge
tend
to
tell
him
to
--
on
a
taken
offense,
he
just
not
(inaudible)
mr.
ralph
moody
we
have
one.
i
think
in
connection
duke
university
but
i
believe
it's
for
some
reason
or
other.
professor
bradley
left
or
quit
or
--
or
stopped
and
it's
--
i
don't
think
it's
operating.
the
one
--
the
only
one
i
know
of
that
is
through
some
bars,
worked
out
representation
for
indigent
people,
officers
in
the
bar
in
raleigh.
it
works
out
a
system.
he
can
tell
you
more
about
that
than
i
can.
but
that
extends
also
to
propter
cases,
civil
cases
and
actions
for
debts
and
things
like
that.
now,
some
of
the
bars
have
worked
out
some
--
some
voluntary
system
of
their
own.
first,
mr.
joslin
relies
very
heavily
on
betts
or
wade
--
wade's
case,
wade
against
mayo.
well,
now,
there
are
similarities
and
analogies
in
wade's
case,
in
this
case.
but,
i
--
i'd
like
to
emphasize
this
to
the
court.
this
court
rested
its
--
largely
conclusions
on
wade's
case
on
the
findings
made
by
the
district
judge.
and
you
said
you
were
--
he
was
there.
he
could
observe
the
--
the
man
and
he
could
see
whether
he
was
capable
of
taking
care
of
his
self
or
not
and
he
went
by
that
unless
--
so
that's
why
the
--
the
whole
wade
is
predicated
on.
actually,
i
don't
know
how
it
came
out.
this
was
only
allegations
of
--
of
habeas
corpus.
now,
you
--
you
go
through
this
case,
and
i
don't
believe
you
can
find
where
this
man
and
--
and
my
--
mr.
joslin,
my
friend
has
been
very
reliant
on
pointing
out
to
you
where
this
man
has
been
badly
treated
in
this
record.
now,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
mr.
mcgave
(ph)
the
attorney
who
started
out,
said
he
would
represent
all
three
and
that
is
the
time
when
he
was
still
going
for
all
three
of
them
when
he
gave
that
search
and
cross-examination
to
the
prosecuting
witness.
it
was
commented
on
here
a
moment
ago.
he
did
reach
a
place
where
there
was
possibly
--
he
thought
there
was
going
to
be
some
conflict
and
he
did
detach
himself.
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
--
frankly,
i
don't
--
i
don't
know.
my
--
my
understanding
is
he
--
he
was
--
for
instance,
we
go
back,
he
was
first
arrested
on
a
warrant.
now,
he
has
had
time
all
the
way
through
that
up
to
the
time
of
his
trial
in
the
superior
court,
he
was
bound
over,
as
we
say,
to
the
superior
court.
mr.
ralph
moody
oh,
he
had
--
mr.
ralph
moody
he
was
arraigned
at
the
same
time
he
was
tried.
that's
where
all
arraignments
are
in
--
in
our
state.
we
don't
have
any
separate
time
for
that.
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i'm
not
--
i
don't
think
he
had
any
opportunity
prior
to
that
time.
frankly,
i
can't
answer
that
if
they
had
any.
i
don't
know
anything.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
don't
--
let's
see
if
i
can
point
that
out
to
your
honor.
let's
see.
the
--
the
order
of
arrest
is
on
18th
of
february.
the
warrant
--
the
return
on
the
warrant
on
page
1
of
the
record
shows
it
was
served
02-18-1958.
mr.
ralph
moody
what's
that?
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
now,
he
had
a
hearing
in
the
recorder's
court
of
cumberland
county.
he
had
a
preliminary
examination
there,
as
i
understand.
mr.
ralph
moody
well
--
mr.
ralph
moody
he
is
arrested
and
--
mr.
ralph
moody
on
a
felony.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
sir,
in
any
charge.
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
that's
--
that's
--
he
is
brought
there
to
see
if
there
is
enough
evidence
to
hold
him
for
trial
in
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
mr.
ralph
moody
he's
arrested
--
mr.
ralph
moody
--
with
a
warrant
but
--
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
as
we
understand
it,
when
they're
called
for
trial
in
the
court,
either
of
general
jurisdiction
and
asked
to
plea
and
that
is
--
to
us,
that
is
the
arraignment.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
he
is
brought
in
before
--
mr.
ralph
moody
there
is
a
charge
in
the
warrant.
yes,
sir.
there
is
a
charge.
he's
charged
in
the
warrant.
mr.
ralph
moody
and
no
--
whether
--
he
ask
him
whether
he
pleads
to
it
or
not.
it's
usually
the
state
has
him.
and
they
--
they're
going
to
put
on
enough
evidence
if
they
can
to
have
him
bound
over.
i
don't
think
they
consult
him
very
much
about
it.
mr.
ralph
moody
just
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
your
honor
is
saying
that
the
attorney
is
required
to
be
appointed
to
prefect
the
appeal?
mr.
ralph
moody
carry
out
the
appeal?
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
mean
--
i'm
--
i'm
--
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
sir,
i
know
it
had
been
here.
and
i
want
to,
of
course,
predicate
it
in
my
arguments
at
all
on
the
--
in
the
rule
under
the
--
the
federal
amendment
in
the
federal
court
at
all,
but
then
don't
you
have
control
over
federal
courts
--
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
was
--
may
i
ask
please?
was
that
the
--
mr.
ralph
moody
--
counsel
to
carry
out
appeal?
mr.
ralph
moody
but
that
was
after
a
trial,
wasn't
it,
had
been
made?
mr.
ralph
moody
yes.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
we
do.
so
we
do
and
that's
why
he
--
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
--
it
would
seem
that
that
is
the
situation.
i
mean,
the
--
there
--
i
mean,
we
--
if
you
are
referring
to
counsel
being
appointed
in
the
post-conviction
hearing
at
--
after
the
trial,
as
i
get
it,
you
seemed
--
you
think
--
if
i'm
correct,
you
think
that
we
--
it's
rather
anomalous
that
we
would
file
--
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
i
don't
think
--[laughter]
mr.
ralph
moody
i
wouldn't
know.
i
wouldn't
undertake
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
moody
but
whatever
it
may
be.
but
as
--
if
--
as
to
the
--
this
case
here,
i
can't
find
incompetent
evidence
admitted
against
him.
i
can't
find,
and
mr.
joslin
says
that
he
has
no
quarrel
with
the
instructions
that
the
court
gave
to
the
jury.
and
in
fact,
after
mr.
mcgave
(ph)
said
that
he
thought
there
was
a
conflict
and
that
they'd
better
go
--
he'd
better
detach,
you
can
find
where
he
has
some
cross
--
some
various
searching
questions
on
cross-examination.
and
you
can
also
look
in
his
record
and
find
where
he
made
some
objections
that
were
sustained
by
the
court.
and
he
had
been
tried
about
a
week
or
10
days
before.
that's
in
mr.
judge
hall's
finding.
when
he
got
down
to
him,
he
had
--
he
--
he
was
a
pretty
good
lawyer
as
a
matter
of
fact.
he
had
been
tried
for
assault
and
robbery,
two
cases
tried
at
the
february
1958
term
of
the
superior
court,
i'm
reading
now
from
record
63.
and
the
petitioner
was
not
represented
by
counsel
in
those
cases.
the
petitioner
conducted
his
own
defense
and
was
acquitted
of
said
assault
and
robbery
charge.
at
that
term,
he
was
acquitted
by
the
jury.
and
he
then
get
along
all
right
with
the
matter
as
far
as
that
goes.
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
it
was
not
--
mr.
ralph
moody
--
your
honor.
and
i
don't
know
what
he's
driving.
mr.
ralph
moody
most
frankly
that
was
never
amplified
and
this
--
mr.
ralph
moody
--
was
brought
out
in
this
evidence
and
i
don't
know
what
his
point
is
there.
mr.
ralph
moody
it
depends,
your
honor,
on
who
the
boy
is.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes.
a
great
deal
on
who
the
trial
judge
is
and
how
he
conducts
his
trial,
whether
he
sees
that
incompetent
evidence
is
not
admitted
against
him
and
whether
he
has
correct
instructions
and
treats
him
fairly.
i
do
not
wish
to
concede
at
all
that
some
boys
that's
18
years
old
and
who've
had
a
--
who
hang
around
in
courthouses
in
the
southern
town
and
who
have
some
records
like
this
can't
defend
themselves
because
i
think
some
of
them
are
very
good
and
very
astute.
mr.
ralph
moody
may
it
please
the
court.
i
--
i
think
that
i
will
discuss
this
--
so
far
as
i
know,
the
--
the
view
point
of
state
of
north
carolina
has
about
the
case,
and
it's
more,
it
seems
to
me,
in
valuation
of
the
record
anyway,
i
--
conceding
that
betts
against
brady
is
still
the
law.
and
so,
unless
the
court
--
whoever
member
of
the
court
has
wishes
to
ask
me
a
question
about
the
record
or
anything,
i
think
i'll
say
anything
follows.
