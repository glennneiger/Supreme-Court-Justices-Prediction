justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
whether
i
am
right
in
inferring
from
the
statement
in
--
what's
the
name
of
the
judge
--
judge
--
presiding
judge
hall's
findings
of
facts
on
page
62
of
the
record,
filed
by
judge
clark,
was
he
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
heman
clark.
as
i
read
paragraph
2
or
finding
2,
am
i
right
in
inferring
that
if
judge
clark
had
saw
fit,
he
could
have
appointed
counsel
in
the
main
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
and
if
that
is
--
if
he
confirm
that,
is
that
by
virtue
of
a
statute
or
by
virtue
of
a
common
law
in
north
carolina?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
automatic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
the
statute
silent
about
the
other
cases
and
the
court
merely
draws
on
all
decisions
in
--
in,
what
we
call
it,
power
and
so
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
you
think
it's
--
do
you
think
it's
too
fanciful
to
argue
that
a
jury
might
be
--
have
a
more
merciful
attitude
to
a
fellow
who
hasn't
got
a
lawyer
than
a
fellow
who
has?
lawyers
aren't
the
most
popular
profession
(inaudible)
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
agree
with
that.
i
mean,
i
might
agree
with
you
on
that.
i
address
myself
to
your
remark
that
the
jury
saw
that
one
put
out
a
lawyer
and
the
other
put
--
it
didn't
as
if
their
natural
impulses
would
be
to
favor
the
fellow
who
didn't
have
a
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
many
cases
have
been
lost
because
of
the
unfair
advocacy
of
the
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly
before
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly
before
jury,
a
very
good
induction
with
such
feelings
that
you
can't
possibly
take
this
and
you
can't,
a
fellow
is
acquitted,
you
can't
complain
that
he
should
have
been
convicted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
guessing
it's
more
complicated
than
--
in
saying
that
it's
an
issue
--
if
anybody
is
allowed
to
appeal
and
everybody
is
allowed
to
appeal
because
you
can't
appeal,
you
can't
appeal,
it
doesn't
follow
that
--
that
if
you
haven't
got
a
lawyer,
you
might
as
well
be
taken
care
of.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
once
after
deciding
this
case,
the
fellow
can
be
allowed
to
defend
himself
if
he
wanted
to
on
the
theory
to
defend
himself
(inaudible)
of
defendants.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow
you.
all
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
merely
suggest
griffin
is
an
equation
to
-
to
transfer
around.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
a
felony
under
your
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
up
to
two
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
two
years
or
more.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
begin
in
few
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
you
have
to
--
all
you
have
to
be
with
here
is
a
felony
case
but
i
shouldn't
think
that's
a
very
satisfactory
line
of
yours
in
getting
two
years
and
getting
one
year,
decides
--
states
very
enormously,
what
--
how
did
they
find
felony,
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
when
did
your
capital
case
started?
where
is
--
when
did
it
get
in
to
your
statute
as
a
capital
offense?
do
you
happen
to
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
the
practice
in
your
courts,
mr.
moody?
the
court
can
appoint
somebody
who's
in
the
courtroom?
is
there
roster
of
lawyers?
or
is
there
a
legal
aid
society
or
whatever
it's
called
in
north
carolina?
justice
felix
frankfurter
most
of
them
are
agricultural
counties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
most
of
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
know
the
bar.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
he
arrested?
what
are
the
dates,
mr.
moody?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
was
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
no
arraignment
before
there
is
--
just
explain
your
practice
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
man
is
arrested?
justice
felix
frankfurter
presumably
on
a
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
a
--
on
a
charge,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
he's
brought
before
some
tribunal,
you
said
cumberland
county
and
there
--
that
--
isn't
that
an
arraignment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
think
there's
an
implied
charge
if
--
on
the
face
of
things
we
charge
him
with
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
evidently
you
have
technical
meaning
for
what
arraignment
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
the
cumberland
court
--
i
mean,
he
is
brought
in
by
police
officers,
is
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
--
what
does
the
judge
say
to
him?
who
says
--
do
you
collect
there
something
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
they
charged
also
with
some
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
he
asked
whether
he
pleads
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
also
depends
who
the
trial
judge
is.
