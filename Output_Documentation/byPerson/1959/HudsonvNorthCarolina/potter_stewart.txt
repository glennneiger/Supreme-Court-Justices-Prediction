justice
potter
stewart
mr.
joslin,
do
you
claim
any
error
in
the
court's
instructions
to
the
jury
that
could
have
been
objected
to
and
corrected
if
the
petitioner
had
been
presented
by
a
lawyer?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
the
instructions
were
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
the
fact
is
that
mr.
mcgeachy
did
cross-examine
the
prosecuting
witness,
mr.
“hell”
whatever
his
name
was,
at
great
length.
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
spell.
and
the
general
thrust
of
that
cross-examination
was
to
try
to
show
the
jury
that
mr.
spell
had
been
drugged
and
that,
of
course,
if
he
had
succeeded,
would
have
or
down
to
the
benefit
of
all
the
defendants,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
spell's
story
generally
was
that
the
leading
role
had
been
played
by
the
petitioner,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
his
--
and
that
cain
had
the
--
had
the
least
prominent
role,
is
that
fair
to
say?
justice
potter
stewart
in
those
cases
where
the
trial
judge
does
appoint
a
lawyer
for
an
indigent
defendant,
does
the
county
compensate
that
lawyer
to?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
noncapital
case.
how
about
a
capital
case?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
preliminary
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
not
--
not
technically
an
arraignment?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
moody,
one
thing
that
struck
me
in
his
petition,
his
post-conviction
petition
appearing
on
page
60
of
the
record,
paragraph
vi
says
that
he
was
tried
on
two
different
cases
that
happened
on
the
same
night
at
the
same
time
10
miles
apart.
he
was
convicted
on
both
of
them,
which
--
which
is
illegally
because
a
man
cannot
be
in
two
different
places
at
the
same
time.
but
that,
i
don't
think,
was
--
that
allegation
wasn't
considered
or
it
wasn't
treated
in
the
court's
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
statements.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
know
what
he's
driving.
justice
potter
stewart
no.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
over
on
the
preceding
page,
we
find
that
the
mr.
mcgeachy
cain's
lawyer
was
actually
still
representing
the
petitioner
and
the
other
codefendant,
wasn't
he?
he
said,
“i
object
in
behalf
of
the
other
boys
to
any
statements
by
david
cain.”
justice
potter
stewart
such
as
on
the
middle
of
page
29.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
that
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
that
statute,
please
tell
me?
