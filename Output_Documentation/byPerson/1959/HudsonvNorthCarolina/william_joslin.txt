mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
joslin
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
william
joslin
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law
for
a
state
to
refuse
the
pretrial
request
of
an
18-year
old
defendant
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
for
his
defense.
the
record
shows
that
he
has
only
a
sixth
grade
education
and
no
means
to
employ
an
attorney
and
for
the
state
then
to
proceed
to
try
and
convict
him
on
a
felony
charge.
the
specific
charge
in
the
indictment
of
this
case
was
that
of
common
law
robbery.
the
conviction
was
that
of
larceny
from
the
person.
now,
by
north
carolina
law,
common
law
robbery
is
a
felony
punishable
by
a
sentence
of
up
to
10
years
imprisonment.
and
larceny
from
the
person
is
described
as
a
lesser
offense.
however,
the
punishment
for
larceny
from
the
person,
which
is
also
a
felony,
is
a
maximum
of
10
years
imprisonment.
thus,
we
have
the
same
maximum
sentence
in
either
case.
and
it
would
be
a
lesser
offense,
as
i
--
as
i
view
the
case
only
in
that
there
is
a
lesser
quantum
of
proof
required.
now,
the
question
was
raised
by
the
petitioner
as
appears
on
page
4
of
the
record,
if
you
indulge
me
just
a
moment.
the
state
was
represented
at
the
trial
by
a
solicitor
and
his
assistant.
the
petitioner,
hudson,
was
tried
along
with
--
with
two
codefendants.
one
of
whom,
david
cain,
had
attorney
of
his
own
choice.
the
record
reads
as
follows,
page
4,
state
represented
by
solicitor
braswell
and
assistant
solicitor
blackwell.
defendant
david
cain
represented
by
attorney
mcgeachy.
other
defendants
not
represented.
defendant
larry
hudson,
“i
don't
have
funds
to
employ
an
attorney
and
i'm
not
capable
of
defending
myself.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
to
employ
me
an
attorney.”
atty.blackwell,
“i
will
say
that
he
is
not
able
to
employ
an
attorney.
but
as
to
whether
he
is
able
to
represent
himself,
i
cannot
say.”
the
court,
“the
court
will
try
to
see
that
your
rights
are
protected
throughout
the
case.”
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
the
defendant
who
had
a
lawyer,
david
cain,
entered
a
plea.
at
the
conclusion
of
state's
evidence,
he
was
given
a
suspended
sentence.
six
months
suspended
on
certain
conditions.
the
defendant,
hudson,
petitioner
in
this
case,
was
given
a
sentence
of
three
to
five
years
in
the
state's
prison
and
the
other
defendant
without
a
lawyer,
ray
stalling,
was
given
18
moths
to
two
years,
not
in
the
prison,
but
on
the
roads.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
filed
notice
of
appeal
following
his
conviction,
but
the
appeal
was
never
perfected
and
this
case
was
brought
here
later
as
a
result
of
a
post-conviction
proceeding
brought
under
north
carolina
law,
which
involved
a
petition
back
to
the
trial
court.
the
appointment
of
counsel
by
the
trial
court,
a
hearing
on
the
allegations
of
the
depravation
of
constitutional
right
of
counsel
and
an
order
was
entered
following
that
hearing
denying
the
relief.
writ
of
certiorari
was
taken
to
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
from
that
order,
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
denied
the
petition
without
opinion.
mr.
william
joslin
the
state
appointed
an
attorney
for
the
petitioner
in
the
proceeding
brought
under
the
post-conviction
statute
to
test
the
constitutionally
of
his
trial.
mr.
william
joslin
that
is
authorized
by
state
law.
whenever
a
petition
is
filed
to
test
the
constitutionally
of
a
conviction,
the
state
will
be
--
the
court
will
inquire
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
has
the
means
to
employ
counsel
of
his
own
and
if
he
needs
counsel
at
such
hearing.
upon
determining
that
he
does
need
counsel
and
does
not
have
the
means
to
employ
a
counsel,
the
state
in
the
post-conviction
hearing
by
statute
will
appoint
--
the
judge
will
appoint
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
mr.
william
joslin
well,
the
main
criteria
seems
to
be
that
of
--
of
need,
though
the
statute
does
not
spell
out
the
criteria.
it
--
it
--
mr.
william
joslin
financial
need.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
joslin
i
don't
know
that
every
--
in
every
case,
there
would
be
an
appointment.
but
certainly,
the
statute
sets
out
the
--
i
wish
i
had
the
exact
wording
before
me,
but
that
the
court
will
appoint
an
attorney
where
the
defendant
does
not
have
the
financial
means
to
employ
his
own
attorney.
and
the
post-conviction
proceeding
then
was
held
from
the
basis
of
--
with
the
assistance
of
counsel
so
appointed.
mr.
william
joslin
where
a
constitutional
question
is
raised.
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
the
counsel
is
paid
by
the
county
in
question
from
which
the
conviction
is
obtained.
mr.
william
joslin
being
fixed
by
the
court.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir,
judge
heman
clark.
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
it's
discretionary.
mr.
william
joslin
your
honor,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it's
by
virtue
of
the
common
law
and
the
court's
--
mr.
william
joslin
--
interpretation
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
there
is
a
--
mr.
william
joslin
--
a
statute
which
specifically
requires
appointment
of
counsel
in
all
capital
cases
that
statute
--
mr.
william
joslin
that's
automatic.
yes,
sir.
the
--
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
the
statute
is
silent
as
to
noncapital
cases.
the
statute
is
set
out
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
on
page
3
--
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
it's
not
set
out
there.
the
statute
though
is
limited
to
capital
cases.
and
in
north
carolina
supreme
court
has,
of
course,
held
that
discretionary
and
noncapital
cases
depending
upon
special
circumstances
and
an
assurance
that
the
defendant
had
a
fair
trial.
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir,
north
carolina
supreme
court
--
mr.
william
joslin
noncapital
cases
has
adhered
to
that
rule.
mr.
william
joslin
well,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
asking
that
--
to
the
extent
that
the
decision
since
betts
and
brady
have
undermined
it
or
modified
it
that
the
court
adhered
to
decisions
since
then,
specifically
wade
against
mayo
seem
to
be
more
nearly
in
point
on
this
case
than
betts
against
brady.
now,
in
this
case,
if
i
may
recite
briefly
some
of
the
facts
which
are
of
record,
the
defendant
is
an
18-year
old
youth.
he
had
a
sixth
grade
education.
mr.
william
joslin
18-year
old
youth.
mr.
william
joslin
white
units.
mr.
william
joslin
white
mark.
he
had
a
sixth
grade
education.
he
had
previously
been
in
court,
didn't
have
a
record,
which
judge
hall
mentions
in
his
findings.
he
was
arrested
under
a
warrant
which
charged
him
with
larceny
from
the
person.
there
was
a
preliminary
hearing
held
and
it
was
bound
over
to
the
superior
court,
which
is
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
the
--
in
north
carolina,
we
do
not
have
a
procedure
for
arraignment
separate
from
trial.
arraignment
in
trial
normally
occur
at
the
same
day
in
court.
he
was
then
brought
in
to
court
for
trial
under
an
indictment,
which
had
been
returned
in
the
meantime
charging
him
with
common
law
robbery.
he
made
his
request
to
the
court
for
the
appointment
of
counsel,
which
was
denied,
and
he
went
immediately
to
trial,
entered
his
plea
of
not
guilty,
and
there
was
thus
no
time
interval
which
elapsed
between
them
at
the
arraignment
and
the
trial,
no
opportunity
for
him
to
take
action
for
his
defense
once
he
had
learned
the
court
was
not
going
to
appoint
counsel
for
him.
in
other
words,
there
were
no
witnesses
subpoenaed
for
him
and
no
other
steps
taken
for
pretrial,
motions
or
tactics.
the
principal
witness
for
the
state
in
this
case
was
one
debbie
g.spell.
now,
spell,
as
the
record
will
bare
out,
had
a
previous
criminal
record.
and
that
likewise
been
for
18
months
in
the
state's
mental
institution
known
as
dix
hill.
now,
these
were
matters
that
were
brought
out
by
the
attorney
for
david
cain
who
was
another
defendant.
mr.
william
joslin
the
--
mr.
william
joslin
it
doesn't
appear.
it's
just
the
simple
statement
in
the
record
that
he
had
been
in
dix
hill
for
a
period
of
18
months.
that
was
not
exploited
and
not
reason
for
his
confinement
in
the
mental
institution.
it
is
not
brought
out
at
the
time.
mr.
william
joslin
no,
sir.
it
--
mr.
william
joslin
it
does
not
show
whether
it
was
a
release
on
probation
or
cured
or
just
how.
mr.
william
joslin
the
defendant,
david
cain,
had
a
lawyer
who
cross-examined
debbie
g.spell
and
he
bought
out
his
prior
convictions
and
also
this
dix
hill
confinement.
the
defendant
hudson
participated
to
some
extent
in
the
trial.
he
asked
spell
some
questions,
but
as
many
defendants
do
who
are
unrepresented,
he
began
to
make
a
speech
to
get
his
version
of
the
incident
before
the
jury,
instead
of
asking
questions
and
the
court
cut
him
off,
warned
him
once
and
then
cut
him
off
so
that
he
did
not
cross-examine
spell
extensively.
he
did
have
an
opportunity,
but
it
was
not
what
you
would
call
an
extensive
or
searching
cross-examination
by
defendant
hudson.
mr.
william
joslin
no,
sir.
the
court
told
him,
“you
will
not
make
a
speech.”
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
the
other
two
witnesses
in
--
for
the
state
in
this
case
were
two
deputy
sheriffs.
and
the
petitioner
in
this
case
did
not
cross-examine
either
of
them.
they
were
cross-examined
by
the
attorney
for
david
cain.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
state's
evidence,
the
lawyer
for
david
cain
submitted
a
plea
to
the
court
for
larceny
and
such
an
amount
as
to
constitute
a
misdemeanor
and
the
court
thereupon
dismissed
the
case
as
to
him
or
judged
him
guilty
and
the
other
two
defendants,
petitioner
hudson
and
stalling
were
notified
their
opportunity
to
argue
to
the
jury.
apparently,
they
did
no
take
this
opportunity.
and
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
the
state
argued
the
case
to
the
jury
or
not.
the
court
charged
the
jury
then
and
the
jury
brought
in
verdicts
of
--
guilty
of
larceny
from
the
person
as
to
defendant
stalling
and
as
to
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
william
joslin
no,
sir,
mr.
william
joslin
i
think
the
instructions
were
correct.
mr.
william
joslin
no,
sir.
there
was
no
instruction
as
to
--
to
that
matter.
under
our
practice,
a
--
an
attorney
for
a
defendant
can
submit
instructions
to
the
court
and
request
the
court
to
make
those
instructions
and
he
can
take
an
exception
from
the
failure
to
make
those
instructions.
of
course,
there
was
no
such
exception
in
the
record
in
this
case.
now,
i
don't
say
that
an
attorney
for
the
defendant
could
not
have
submitted
additional
instructions,
could
have
--
which
would
have
gone
beyond
those
made
by
the
court,
but
none
was
made
and
there
was
no
--
no
instructions
submitted
or
given
by
the
court
in
regard
to
the
guilty
plea
submitted
by
david
cain,
all
of
which
period
in
the
presence
of
jury.
the
sentence
--
mr.
william
joslin
the
sentence
was
imposed
the
next
day.
apparently,
that
occurred
about
the
close
of
the
court
and
sentence
was
imposed
the
next
day.
mr.
william
joslin
it
doesn't
appear,
except
as
--
except
that
it
shows
that
it
was
on
the
following
day.
i
mean,
there
was
not
--
apparently
no
intervening
matter
before
the
court.
and
following
the
sentences,
the
petitioner
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
with
the
court.
i
already
failed
to
prosecute
this
appeal
properly.
our
procedure
requires
that
the
defendant
prepare
a
case
on
appeal,
which
is
a
summary
of
the
testimony
and
bill
of
exceptions
and
so
on,
rather
technical.
those
requirements
were
not
met.
the
appeal
was
subsequently
dismissed
and
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
filed.
it
was
likewise
was
dismissed.
and
finally,
a
second
so-called
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
filed
with
the
trial
court.
the
court
elected
to
consider
this
as
a
proceeding
under
the
post-conviction
act
and
not
as
a
strict
habeas
corpus
petition.
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
we
have
a
rotation
system
of
judges
in
north
carolina.
and
as
of
july
1st,
another
judge
would
have
been
holding
court
in
that
county.
and
judge
heman
clark
was
the
trial
judge.
judge
hall,
c.w.hall
was
holding
the
courts
thereby
of
the
time
that
the
second
petition
was
filed.
and
judge
hall,
as
i
have
noted,
had
counsel
appointed
for
petitioner
at
this
hearing
and
went
into
a
consideration
of
the
matter
on
the
merits.
now,
the
constitutional
question
did
not
attempt
to
evade
it
or
state
that
the
petitioner
had
failed
to
prosecute
his
appeal
or
had
mistaken
his
remedy,
but
he
found
--
found
facts
into
the
judgment
which
denied
it
and
found
that
the
petitioner
had
not
been
deprived
of
due
process
of
law
or
did
not
have
any
substantial
constitutional
right
through
the
failure
to
appoint
counsel
at
the
trial.
i
might
say
too
that
this
record
--
that
the
finding
of
judge
hall
in
regard
to
the
representation
by
david
cain's
attorney
is
interesting.
this
--
this
lawyer,
at
the
trial,
offered
to
represent
all
three
defendants.
he
said,
“i
will
take
on
the
other
two,
judge,
as
long
as
the
interest
don't
conflict.”
and
the
judge
did
not
make
any
response
at
the
time,
but
several
pages
over
in
the
record,
the
court
found
that
the
interest
of
the
defendants
were
beginning
to
conflict,
and
he
said,
“you'd
better
just
represent
--
just
cross-examine
on
behalf
of
your
--
your
own
client,
david
cain,
and
not
try
to
represent
the
others.”
and
judge
hall
in
finding
3
stated
that
n.h.
mcgeachy
jr.,
attorney
for
david
cain
told
the
court
that
he
would
help
all
three
defendants
as
long
as
there
was
no
conflict
of
interest.
but
the
court
thought
there
might
be
some
conflict
of
interest
and
mr.
mcgeachy
represented
only
the
defendant
david
cain
at
said
trial.
so
the
petitioner
was
without
counsel.
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
and
the
findings
will
--
will
show.
mr.
william
joslin
debbie
g.spell.
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
it
would
have.
there
was
also
some
question
of
who
had
taken
the
leading
role
in
this
so
--
this
alleged
robbery
incident.
and
spell's
testimony,
for
instance,
and
the
testimony
of
the
deputy
sheriffs
does
not
line
up.
there
is
a
conflict
there
in
regard
to
the
leading
role
played
in
the
robbery
and
that
was
a
matter
that
might
have
been
exploited,
done
by
separate
counsel
for
each
defendant.
mr.
william
joslin
by
petitioner
hudson.
mr.
william
joslin
that
the
--
the
cain
is
the
man
who
owned
the
car
in
the
case
and
he
had
the
least
to
do
with
it,
i
would
say.
the
--
the
deputy
sherifs,
two
of
them
stated
that
stalling,
ray
stalling
had
made
statements
to
them
which
indicated
that
he
had
played
the
leading
role
in
--
in
the
alleged
robbery.
now,
this
court
has
followed
since
betts
and
brady,
a
rule
that
in
noncapital
cases
for
a
defendant,
the
case
of
wade
against
mayo,
which
was
decided
in
1947,
is
in
the
tradition
or
in
the
line
of
cases
of
--
that
started
with
betts
against
brady.
in
the
wade
against
mayo
case,
the
facts
were
almost
identical
with
those
in
this
case.
in
that
case,
the
petitioner
was
an
18-year
old
defendant.
he
had
a
prior
record.
he
was
indicted
with
--
on
a
noncapital
charge
that
are
breaking
and
entering.
he
made
a
pretrial
request
for
the
appointment
of
counsel,
stating
that
he
didn't
have
the
funds
to
employ
a
counsel
of
his
own.
the
court
denied
that
request.
at
the
trial,
he
was
advised
of
his
right
to
cross-examine
the
witnesses
against
him
and
he
did
avail
himself
to
some
extent
of
that
right.
there
were
--
but
he
did
not
summon
any
witnesses
of
his
own.
he
took
the
stand
as
did
the
defendant
--
the
petitioner
in
this
case
and
testified.
he
did
not
make
any
argument
to
the
jury.
in
that
case,
the
petitioner
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
and
the
district
court
of
florida
found
the
facts.
and
the
court
in
that
case
made
a
specific
finding
that
the
petitioner
was
unable
to
represent
himself
in
court.
there's
nothing
to
show
how
much
formal
education
he
had
had,
but
the
court
was
satisfied
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
before
it
that
this
petitioner
was
unable
to
defend
himself
adequately
in
wade
against
mayo
and
that
he
should
have
been
granted
his
request
for
a
counsel.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
bring
it
almost
squarely
within
the
wade
against
mayo
doctrine,
as
i
see
it.
if
anything,
there
is
even
more
room
for
prejudice
or
for
the
need,
petitioner
to
have
counsel.
there
were
--
was
a
defendant
in
this
case
who
had
counsel
and
he
had
none.
and
there
was
a
plea
submitted,
which
the
jury
observed,
saw.
and
this
petitioner
could
not
have
helped
but
have
been
prejudiced
by
that
fact.
the
--
mr.
william
joslin
well,
that's
very
true.
they're
not
the
most
popular
profession
in
the
world,
but
i
think
that
--
that
counsel
could
have
been
considerably
benefited
here
in
--
in
--
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
joslin
the
trial
judge
has
control
of
the
sentence.
mr.
william
joslin
no,
sir.
it's
only
in
a
--
in
a
capital
case
that
the
jury
can
make
a
recommendation
regarding
sentence.
the
--
the
trial
court
had
the
discretion
to
impose
the
sentence
up
to
a
maximum
of
10
years.
we
think
that
wade
against
mayo,
following
the
line
of
cases
started
at
betts
against
brady,
is
determinative
and
should
be
controlling
on
this
--
on
the
court
in
this
case.
now,
since
the
decision
in
betts
against
brady,
this
court
has
had
occasion
in
griffin
against
illinois
and
a
subsequent
line
of
cases
to
hold
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
requires
that
an
indigent
defendant
be
granted
a
right
to
appeal
comparable
to
the
right
and
appeal
which
a
defendant
means
would
have.
in
the
griffin
case,
the
defendant
there
was
denied
an
appellate
review
because
he
didn't
get
up
his
bill
of
exceptions
properly
and
he
could
have
gotten
that
bill
of
exceptions
together
only
if
he
had
a
copy
of
the
trial
transcript.
that
would
have
meant
he
would
had
--
had
means
enough
to
pay
for
the
transcript.
and
as
was
clearly
shown
in
that
case,
he
didn't
have
the
means,
could
not
affect
his
appeal.
now,
the
court
--
and
this
court
has
held
that
due
process
of
law
does
not
require
that
a
state
provide
an
appeal
from
a
conviction
or
other
court
proceeding.
but
if
the
state
thus
provide
an
appellate
procedure,
it
must
make
that
appellate
procedure
open
and
available
to
the
indigent
defendant
as
well
as
the
one
with
means.
an
essential
ingredient
of
any
hearing,
as
this
court
has
held
and
noted
in
number
of
cases
starting
from
powell
against
alabama
on
down,
is
there
is
representation
by
counsel.
and
here,
we
have
a
case
where
the
defendant
could
not
obtain
counsel
because
of
lack
of
means.
it
was
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
hearing
that
he
have
representation
by
counsel.
now,
the
state
of
north
carolina,
by
statute
and
by
constitution,
guarantees
to
defendants
of
means
the
right
to
represent
--
to
representation
by
a
counsel.
but
here,
this
same
guarantee
to
defendant
a
means
is
cut
ff
and
denied
to
this
petitioner
solely
because
of
his
lack
of
funds
to
employ
his
own
counsel.
the
decision
in
griffin
against
illinois
and
the
cases
following
it,
the
logic
of
those
cases,
i
think,
leads
to
the
--
but
one
conclusion
that
a
state
cannot
deny
a
defendant
counsel
solely
on
the
ground
of
his
lack
of
means
to
employ
counsel
where
under
similar
circumstances
another
defendant
with
means
can
employ
counsel.
now,
certainly
you
--
a
state
cannot
begin
to
weigh
the
merits
of
one
counsel
against
another
and
say
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
counsel
just
as
good
as
the
--
just
as
competent
as
the
prosecution.
but
--
mr.
william
joslin
certainly
--
mr.
william
joslin
certainly,
they
have.
mr.
william
joslin
well
--
mr.
william
joslin
well
--
mr.
william
joslin
well,
certainly,
if
he
--
if
the
defendant
wants
to
reject
the
appointment
of
counsel,
he
would
have
every
right
to
so.
but
we
think
here
where
he
has
requested
the
appointment,
he
--
mr.
william
joslin
--
feels
himself
that
he
is
inadequate.
mr.
william
joslin
well,
the
language
in
griffin,
i
believe,
is
--
is
persuasive
and
i
might
mention
that
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
griffin
case,
i
think,
would
offer
a
good
solution
to
this
problem.
as
admittedly,
it
is
a
serious
one
for
this
court.
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
we
--
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
thrust.
anyone
of
those
three
grounds,
we
think,
would
be
adequate
in
--
in
this
case.
wade
against
mayo
or
the
due
process
clause
is
growing
and
vital,
a
clause
of
the
constitution
which
permits
some
change
and
does
incorporate
the
sense
of
justice
of
the
american
nation
as
i
think
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
it
to
be.
and
finally,
the
griffin
against
illinois
are
a
combination
of
equal
protection
and
due
process.
mr.
william
joslin
a
felony
is
any
crime
which
is
punishable
by
imprisonment
in
the
state's
prison
for
--
for
term
up
to
two
years.
mr.
william
joslin
or
two
years
or
more.
mr.
william
joslin
two
years
or
more.
mr.
william
joslin
imprisonment
in
the
state's
prison.
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
if
the
sentence
is
less
than
two
years,
they're
commonly
served
on
the
roads,
not
in
the
state's
--
mr.
william
joslin
--
penitentiary.
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir,
they
do.
mr.
william
joslin
i
do
not
know
--
i
don't
have
an
exact
compilation.
i
think
i've
cited
an
authority
that
sets
out
the
--
the
breakdown
of
the
states.
and
of
course,
in
betts
against
brady,
there
is
a
breakdown
of
the
states.
but
there
have
been
some
changes
since
the
betts
against
brady
decision.
i
have
a
recollection
that
it's
about
42
that
would
require
appointment
of
counsel
in
any
felony
case
or
any
case
involving
a
“serious
crime”,
but
i
do
not
have
the
exact
figures
on
that.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
joslin
about
42,
yes.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
william
joslin
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
moody
stated
that
there
were
no
instances
in
the
record
of
admission
of
incompetent
testimony
against
petitioner
in
this
trial.
at
page
29
of
the
record,
28
and
29,
the
prosecuting
witness
there
is
the
one
of
the
deputy
sheriffs
and
he's
being
examined
by
a
solicitor.
he's
about
to
quote
a
statement
made
by
one
of
the
defendants.
the
court
cautioned
him
on
page
28,
cautions
the
jury
not
to
--
not
to
consider
any
testimony
given
as
against
any
defendant
other
than
david
cain,
the
one
who
is
supposed
to
made
the
statement
quoted.
then,
over
about
--
it
follows
a
series
of
questions
and
answers.
and
on
page
29,
it
finally
gets
around
to
the
damaging
part.
question,
“did
he
name
them?”
meaning
the
defendant
david
cain.
“no,
sir.”
“well,
you
did
later
on?”
“yes,
sir.”
question,
“who
were
the
other
three
boys
in
the
car?”
answer,
“it
was
larry
hudson,
ray
stalling
and
rubin
grimsley,
which
is
a
juvenile
which
is
now
turned
over
to
the
juvenile
authorities.”
“all
right.”
there
was
no
objection
taken
at
that
point
and
no
limiting
instruction
at
that
point
that
the
testimony
should
not
be
considered
as
against
petitioner,
larry
hudson.
and
true
it
was.
it
did
appear,
it
does
appear
over
on
the
preceding
page
but
that's
a
long
waste
of
way
in
the
jury.
i
think
if
counsel
had
been
present,
there
would
certainly
had
been
a
--
another
instruction
made
to
limit
it.
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
he
did
there
--
he
did
make
that
objection
at
that
point.
and
there
--
there
are
instances
in
here
where
it
says
objection
by
defendants,
it
isn't
clear
who
made
the
objection
whether
it
was
one
of
the
defendants
in
person
or
was
the
attorney.
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
on
the
next
statement
whereas
he
begin
to
quote
another
statement
--
mr.
william
joslin
--
there.
mr.
grimsley's
statement.
mr.
william
joslin
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
that
--
that
you
can
--
the
--
i
know
the
state
argues
that
in
this
case,
and
they
--
they
cite
state
against
cruse
as
a
support
for
that.
now,
that
was
a
right
to
counsel
case
which
came
up
on
a
post-conviction
hearing.
and
the
--
the
court
--
in
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
in
the
cruse
case
stated
that
you
cannot
use
a
post-conviction
procedure
as
substitute
for
an
appeal.
they
damage
general
principle.
but
then,
it
went
into
consideration
of
the
merits
of
the
case
and
it
discussed
in
detail
the
fact
that
there
was
no
request
made
for
appointment
of
counsel
at
the
trial
that
the
case
was
one
which
fell
within
the
line
of
--
of
cases
cited
by
this
court,
the
betts
and
brady.
it
was
a
long
discussion
on
the
merits
of
the
complaint
made.
so,
as
i
see
it,
the
north
carolina
court,
in
the
cruse
case
very
definitely
decided
that
in
a
post-conviction
hearing,
the
--
an
allegation
of
denial
of
right
to
counsel
could
be
heard
and
determined
on
the
merits.
now,
there
are
one
or
two
other
questions
that
were
raised.
it
--
i
did
not
have
the
north
carolina
law
before
me
at
the
time.
i
would
like
to
read
one
--
one
statute
in
particular.
this
is
the
post-conviction
procedure.
and
the
--
the
statute
says
if
the
petitioners
without
counsel
and
alleges
in
the
petition
that
he
is
without
means
of
any
natures
sufficient
to
procure
a
counsel,
he
shall
state
whether
or
not
he
wishes
counsel
to
be
appointed
to
represent
him.
if
appointment
of
counsel
is
so
requested,
the
court
shall
appoint
counsel
if
satisfied
that
petitioner
has
no
means
sufficient
to
procure
counsel.
the
court
shall
fix
the
compensation
to
be
paid
such
counsel
which
when
so
determine
shall
be
paid
by
the
county
in
which
the
conviction
occurred.
mr.
william
joslin
that
is
15-2
--
mr.
william
joslin
section
15-219
of
the
general
statutes
of
north
carolina.
mr.
william
joslin
the
--
the
statute
--
the
--
the
hearing
provided
by
--
in
this
--
in
this
section
is
supposed
to
be
on
constitutional
questions
only.
mr.
william
joslin
yes,
sir.
and
there
was
one
other
statute
that
was
discussed
dealing
with
a
procedure
on
arraignment
and
appointment
of
counsel
in
a
--
now,
the
--
the
north
carolina
statute
provide
for
appointment
of
counsel
in
capital
cases
as
a
matter
of
right
and
when
the
--
if
--
provide
as
follows,
“if
the
judge
is
satisfied
that
the
accused
is
unable
to
employ
counsel,
he
shall
appoint
counsel
to
represent
the
accuse
as
soon
as
maybe
practicable.
he
may
appoint
counsel
anytime
regardless
of
whether
notified
by
the
clerk
and
before
preliminary
examination.
in
any
capital
case
where
the
appointment
of
counsel
is
delayed
until
the
term
of
court
which
the
accused
is
arraigned
on
motion
of
counsel
for
the
accused,
the
case
shall
be
continued
until
the
next
ensuing
term
of
criminal
court.
mr.
william
joslin
the
library
didn't
have
the
general
statutes
for
me.
i
had
to
look
it
up
in
session
laws.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
this
is.
they
just
brought
me
this
volume
just
while
i
was
talking.
i
do
not
know
the
cite
here,
but
the
citation
in
this
--
in
the
session
laws
is
1949
session
laws
chapter
112.
if
there
are
any
other
questions,
i
could
answer
them
if
i
had
to
do
so.
