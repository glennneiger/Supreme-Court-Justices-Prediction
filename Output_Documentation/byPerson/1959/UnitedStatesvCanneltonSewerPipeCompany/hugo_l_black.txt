of
what?
justice

l.
black
has
there
--
has
there
ever
been
any
regulation
that
provided
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
when
the
first
claim
was
made,
at
least
as
it
developed
into
losses,
had
finished
products
--
the
value
of
finished
products
would
be
used
to
measure
the
depletion
allowance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
idea
that
commercially
marketable
has
to
mean
marketable
at
a
profit
to
the
owners?
justice
hugo
l.
black
during
the
depression
there
was
considerable
--
as
i
recall
it,
many
complaints
made
of
the
oil
industry
that
the
price
was
so
low
that
it's
impossible
to
sell
it
at
a
profit.
would
you
say
that
the
oil
then
was
not
commercially
marketable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
requires,
does
it
not,
that
one
accepts
your
distinction
between
an
incentive
allowance
and
a
depletion
allowance?
otherwise,
i'd
suppose
that
you
can't
be
depleted
of
any
more
than
what
it's
worth
and
if
it's
not
--
has
no
market,
you
can't
sell
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
wouldn't
be
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you're
restricted
in
other
ways
of
what
you
were
actually
will
be
depleted
of,
so
you
will
not
deplete
it
of
any
sulfide.

what
page
you
said
(voice

--
justice
hugo

your
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
the
italics
apply
to
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
you
say
the
reports
--
did
you
cite
the
place
where
the
reports
said
that
it
was
the
intent
of
the
committee?
justice

89?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
place
where
they
define
marketable
--
commercially
marketable
product?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
--
did
you
--
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
assume
that
denial
of
a
certiorari
meant
nothing
or
not?[laughter]
