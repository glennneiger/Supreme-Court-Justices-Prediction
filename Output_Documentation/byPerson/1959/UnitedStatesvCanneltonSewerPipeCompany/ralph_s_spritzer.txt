mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
this
is
a
tax
case,
one
which
we
believe
to
be
of
broad,
economic
and
legal
implications.
in
relation
to
this
taxpayer,
it
raises
the
question
whether
a
company
which
mines
fire
clay
and
shale
to
whether
cheap
and
common
minerals
which
characteristically
sell
at
something
around
$2
or
less
a
ton.
a
company
which
mines
those
minerals
and
thereafter,
manufactures
them
into
sewer
pipes,
which
sell
at
$35
or
$40
a
ton
may
take
percentage
depletion
on
the
theory
that
its
total
receipts
from
the
sale
of
sewer
pipe
represent
its
gross
income
from
mining.
now,
taxpayer's
contention
that
it
may
do
precisely
that
may
strike
the
court
as
rather
startling,
because
though
it
has
long
been
recognized
that
mineral
depletion
provides
a
very
liberal
allowance
for
mining,
it
is
not
generally
been
thought,
at
least
until
very
recently,
that
percentage
depletion
affords
a
gigantic
subsidy
for
manufacturing
operations
as
well.
now,
what
we
challenge
here
is
not
the
concept
of
percentage
depletion,
but
the
attempt
to
incorporate
into
the
base
upon
which
percentage
depletion
is
taken,
values
created
by
operations
which
are
far
removed
from
the
concept
of
mining.
of
the
12
principal
processes
used
in
making
sewer
pipe
as
explained,
as
outlined
in
taxpayers'
complaint
in
this
case,
at
record
252,
the
first
one
of
the
12
takes
in
the
mining
of
the
clay,
the
loading
and
the
unloading
of
it
and
the
delivery
to
the
factory
gates,
and
the
other
11
are
processes
which
are
performed
inside
the
cannelton
factory,
and
which
involve,
as
the
testimony
of
taxpayers,
officer
would
show
the
use,
among
other
things,
of
automatic
presses
and
of
extrusion
machinery.
in
our
view,
this
is
a
complete
perversion
of
the
depletion
statute
and
of
the
implementing
regulations,
and
we
think
it
is
in
the
teeth
of
some
40
years
or
more
of
history,
the
whole
history
of
mineral
depletion.
in
the
course
of
which,
i
may
say,
no
representative
of
the
mining
industry
ever
contended
that
the
branch
of
the
industry
which
he
represented
would
be
entitled
to
take
depletion
on
finished
products
of
the
kind
which
taxpayer
says
may
constitute
the
basis
of
depletion
in
this
case.
first,
let
me
state
a
little
more
of
the
facts
before
getting
to
the
statute.
the
tax
years
here
are
1950
and
in
1951.
in
both
those
years,
taxpayer,
which
is
an
indiana
corporation
mined
this
fire
clay
and
shale
from
pits
which
were
very
close
to
its
factory.
it
didn't
sell
this
fire
clay
or
shale,
being
an
integrated
operator
it
used
it
all
in
the
manufacture
of
sewer
pipe
and
certain
related
products.
its
cost
in
extracting
mineral
was
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
$2
per
ton.
as
i
indicated,
its
sales
price
on
the
finished
sewer
pipe
averages
close
to
$40
a
ton.
its
complaint
claims
depletion
on
the
express
and
explicit
basis
that
its
gross
income
from
mining
embraces
the
total
receipts
from
its
--
from
the
sale
of
its
finished
products.
the
depletion
rate,
incidentally,
on
fire
clay
is
15%
on
the
statute.
the
depletion
rate
on
shale
is
5%.
and
since
it
appears
the
taxpayer
uses
fire
clay
and
shale,
which
come
out
of
the
same
mining
operation,
incidentally.
in
60
to
40
proportions,
it
gets
what
i
might
call
a
mixed
rate,
which
works
out
to
11%.
and
this
rate
as
applied
to
a
depletion
base
computed
by
reference
to
the
sales
receipts
from
the
sale
of
sewer
pipe
yield
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
gross
receipt.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
your
honor,
yield
an
allowance
of
a
little
over
$4
per
ton.
now,
this
record
shows
that
miners
of
fire
clay
in
indiana
who
are
nonintegrated
sold
fire
clay
and
shale
for
less
than
$2
a
ton.
it
was
sold
in
substantial
quantities
for
prices
ranging
from
$1.60
to
$1.90.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
raw
clay
and
shale.
and
the
depletion
on
clay
and
shale,
which
this
taxpayer
gets
by
its
computation,
yield
with
over
$4
a
ton,
and
my
--
the
point
i
am
bringing
out
is
that
its
depletion
allowance
actually
comes
to
double
what
it
could
have
gone
out
and
bought
fire
clay
and
shale
for.
another
way
of
putting
it
would
be
that
the
united
states
treasury
would
be
better
off
if
cannelton's
theory
of
depletion
is
correct,
to
go
out
and
buy
fire
clay
and
shale,
and
give
it
to
cannelton
free
of
charge.[laughter]
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.[laughs]
because
if
depletion
is
a
ticket
to
taking
depletion
--
if
the
statute
is
a
ticket
to
taking
depletion
on
the
finished
product,
cannelton
is
better
off
rejecting
such
an
offer
than
it
would
be
accepting
it.
there
was
a
miner
across
the
river
from
the
cannelton
company
who
mined
clay,
the
$1.40
a
ton
and
sold
it
to
a
competing
sewer
pipe
manufacture.
cannelton's
depletion
allowance
is
over
$4
a
ton.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
cannelton's
is
over
$2.
they
have
a
deep
mine
and
their
costs
are
higher
than
most
of
these
miners.
so
they,
more
recently,
buy
it
instead
of
mining
it.
well,
“buy
it”
is
the
wrong
word.
more
recently,
they're
obtaining
it
from
this
same
miner
across
the
river.
they'd
given
him
a
dollar
in
return
for
which
they
have
taken
the
lease,
and
they've
given
him
a
contract
to
mine
the
fire
clay
and
shale.
they
claim
the
economic
interest
on
the
basis
of
this
lease.
and
now,
they
take
depletion
on
his
fire
clay
and
shale
which
he
can
mine
and
apparently,
make
a
profit
on
delivering
it
at
a
$1.40
a
ton.
they're
getting
the
depletion
on
that
apparently
today,
yielding
upwards
of
$4
a
ton.
the
nonintegrated
miners
of
fire
clay,
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
would
necessarily
take
depletion
on
the
basis
of
the
value
of
the
raw
clay
and
shale.
that
would
mean
for
someone
selling
fire
clay
at
$2,
he'd
get
30
cents.
if
he
sold
shale,
and
shale
was
sold
for
$1
a
ton,
he
would
get
5
cents
a
ton.
i
won't
labor
the
figures
further.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
noted
that
the
government
had
proved
that
there
were
miners
of
fire
clay
and
shale
in
indiana
who
were
nonintegrated
and
who
were
selling
it.
it
noted
that
out
of
500,000
tons
of
fire
clay
sold
in
indiana,
in
the
tax
year
involved,
taxpayer's
own
expert
conceded
that
something
like
300,000
tons
had
been
sold
by
nonintegrated
producers.
and
the
basis
of
the
court's
holding
that
cannelton,
unlike
miners
of
the
same
clients
who
are
nonintegrated,
may
take
depletion
on
the
basis
of
finished
product.
the
basis
of
its
holding
was
that
cannelton,
because
of
its
high
mining
cost
and
the
high
transportation
cost,
which
it
would
have
had
in
bringing
raw
clay
and
shale
to
the
markets
where
it
is
sold
in
quantity,
could
not
have
sold
it
profitably.
now
we
don't
contest
that
finding.
we
agree
that
it
could
not
have
sold
it
profitably,
its
costs
being
what
they
were.
we
don't
think
that
that
has
--
that
that
is
the
test
under
the
statute.
and
that,
of
course,
brings
me
without
further
delay
to
the
statute.
the
statute
is
set
out
in
our
brief
on
page
93,
in
relevant
provision
as
--
i
would
like
to
identify
the
language
for
the
court.
i
seem
to
lose
my
place
at
the
moment.
oh,
yes.
it
starts
about
four
or
five
lines
from
the
bottom
on
page
93.
our
question,
of
course,
here
is
what
is
embraced
in
the
concept
of
mining.
the
statute
first
says
that
depletion
may
be
taken
on
the
basis
of
the
gross
income
from
the
property.
it
defines
gross
income
from
the
property
as
gross
income
from
mining,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
the
term
mining,
as
used
herein,
shall
be
considered
to
include
not
merely
the
extraction
of
the
ores
or
minerals
from
the
ground,
but
also
the
ordinary
treatment
processes
normally
applied
by
mine
owners
or
operators
in
order
to
obtain
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
product.
now,
that
is
the
crucial
language,
though
there
is
some
further
language
to
which
i'll
refer
in
a
few
minutes,
which
sheds
further
light.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
here,
concentrated
on
the
words,
“commercially
marketable
product”
and
it
said,
“yes,
raw
fire
clay
and
shale
have
commercial
value
and
the
government's
proof
in
this
case
has
shown
that
there
is
a
regular
commerce
in
those
minerals.
nonetheless,
it
goes
on
to
hold
that
taxpayer
did
not
have
a
commercially
marketable
product.
it
individually,
it
did
not
have
a
commercially
marketable
product
because
the
court
says
it
could
not
sell
its
fire
clay
and
shale
at
a
profit.
as
to
the
antecedent
words,
you
will
note
that
the
statute
speaks
of
a
miner
being
unable
to
take
depletion
on
the
basis
to
include
in
depletion
the
ordinary
treatment
processes
normally
applied
by
mine
owners
and
operators
to
obtain
that
product.
as
to
those
antecedent
words,
ordinary
treatment
processes,
the
district
court
made
the
finding,
which
you
will
find
at
record
5,
that
the
--
this
is
finding
10,
that
the
processes
used
by
plaintiff,
and
i'll
skip
on,
where
processes
normally
applied
by
mine
owners
or
operators
who
are
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
vitrified
clay
sewer
pipe
and
related
products.
and
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
agreed
with
that
finding.
now,
the
result
here
is
that
the
court
below
has
held,
one,
that
the
individual
miner
manufacturer,
the
miner
who's
integrated,
can
take
his
depletion
on
the
basis
of
the
product
which
he
finds
it
profitable
in
his
operation
to
make
and
sell,
the
finished
product,
if
that's
the
first
thing
he
finds
it
profitable
to
make
and
sell.
and
it
has
held,
second,
that
there's
no
objection
to
his
including
in
the
depletion
base
whatever
processes,
whatever
their
nature,
are
acquired
in
order
to
obtain
that
finished
product.
now,
we
differ
on
both
those
propositions.
now,
cannelton's
main
reliance,
as
i've
said,
is
upon
the
words,
“commercially
marketable
mineral
product”.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
only
--
no.
he
can
--
the
taxpayer,
the
court
of
appeals
said
can
go
to
that
point
where
he
obtains
a
product
which
he
can
market
at
a
profit.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
they
allow
him
to
go
as
far
as
--
oh,
yes,
yes.
they
say
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
that
his
depletion
base
in
this
case
is
not
raw
fire
clay
and
shale
even
though
there
is
a
regular
commerce
in
those
products
because
he
could
not
sell
it
at
a
profit.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
absolutely.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
the
court
of
appeals
says
in
its
opinion,
necessarily
the
nonintegrated
miner
would
take
it
on
raw
fire
clay
and
shale,
and
it
would
also
say,
presumably,
that
if
a
manufacturer
had
a
lower
cost
to
mine
than
cannelton,
but
otherwise,
did
the
same
thing,
so
that
it
could
have
sold
the
raw
fire
clay
and
shale
at
a
profit
at
the
going
price
that
he
would
take
it
only
on
the
fire
clay
and
shale
and
not
on
the
sewer
pipe,
which
gives
it
20
times
greater
yield.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
court
does
not
deal
with
that.
i
would
rather
doubt
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
say
that
the
--
that
it
was
going
to
attempt
to
determine
what
the
manufacturer
could
make
if
he
had
a
different
type
of
factory.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
my
answer
to
justice
harlan
was
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
concluded
in
this
case
that
cannelton
with
its
mining
costs
could
have
sold
raw
fire
clay
and
shale
at
a
profit,
it
would
have
held
that
that
was
the
depletion
base.
on
the
other
hand,
finding
the
contrary,
it
held
the
taxpayer
could
go
on
to
the
product
which
it
did
make,
which
yielded
at
a
profit,
which
is
sewer
pipe.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
the
only
product
it
makes
other
than
the
fire
clay
and
the
shale,
and
that
is
our
contention
that
the
raw
fire
clay
and
shale
is
a
commercially
valuable
product
and
that
all
miners
of
fire
clay
and
shale
must
take
depletion
on
the
same
basis.
it
is
the
industry-wide,
commercially
marketable
product
for
miners
of
the
same
client,
and
if
one
takes
the
--
the
view
which
cannelton
suggests,
the
consequence
would
be
that
a
high
cost
mine,
badly
located,
which
is
by
hypothesis,
less
valuable
as
a
mine,
would
qualify
for
far
greater
depletion
than
a
low-cost,
well
located
mine,
which
is
by
hypothesis,
more
valuable,
because
it
can
compete
effectively
at
the
going
price
for
the
mineral
product.
this
stands
depletion
on
its
head.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
was
about
to
reach
that,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
says
that
the
word
“marketable”
implies
that
there
must
be
an
opportunity
to
market
it
profitably.
it
says
in
this
case,
to
indicate
how
we've
viewed
the
question
that
was
before
it.
it
summed
up
the
issue
in
one
sentence
that
it
saw
the
issue
speaks
the
question
squarely
presented
at
the
beginning
of
the
opinion.
that's
on
267.
the
question
squarely
presented
is
whether
that
statutory
language
which
defines
as
a
part
of
mining,
all
ordinary
treatment
processes
normally
applied
by
mine
owners
to
produce
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
products
or
product,
includes
all
processes
necessary
by
a
taxpayer
to
obtain
a
product
which
can
be
sold
at
a
profit.
now,
it
gets
to
--
and
the
word
profit
isn't
in
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
has
taken
the
term
“marketable”
to
imply
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
to
imply
marketable
at
a
profit.
now,
we
would
say
initially
to
that
that
a
product
is
marketable
if
there's
a
regular
commerce
in
it,
and
the
market,
as
every
entrepreneur
knows,
frequently
imposes
a
loss,
as
well
as
a
profit,
and
this
statute
does
not
import
any
notion
of
profitability.
we
think
that
the
words
“commercially
marketable
mineral
product”
refer
to
the
basic
product
of
the
mine,
whatever
the
classes
of
mine.
in
a
state
where
the
mineral
has
been
sufficiently
separated
from
the
waste
and
impurities
in
which
it
is
found
in
its
natural
form,
and
sufficiently
prepared
if
preparation
is
necessary
so
that
it's
ready
for
shipment
or
for
use.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
on
our
theory,
this
miner
had
a
marketable
product
when
it
had
the
shale
and
clay
removed
from
the
ground
and
transported
into
the
surface
and
loaded.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
before
any
of
the
processes
that
begin
with
paragraph
(b).
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
since
taxpayer
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
this
happens
to
be
a
mineral,
which
is
saleable,
can
be
sold
as
it's
dug
out
of
the
ground
and
loaded
on
trucks.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
they'll
--
they're
allowed
all
ordinary
treatment
processes.
in
fact,
the
only
thing
they
do
with
fire
clay
and
shale
is
dig
it
up.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
for
that
particular
mineral.
it's
unusual
that
--
it's
an
unusual
mineral
in
that
respect.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
because
it's
not
involved.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mineral
treatment
means
simply,
in
its
common
usage
in
the
industry,
doing
what's
necessary
to
the
mineral
to
eliminate
the
waste
and
impurities
and
get
it
in
--
conditionally,
you
can
ship
it.
now
with
most
minerals,
there
are
good
many
things
that
have
to
be
done.
a
low
grade
iron
ore
comes
out
of
the
ground
and
it
has
such
a
great
amount
of
waste
that
it
wouldn't
be
worth
the
price
of
shipping
it,
unless
you
eliminated
some
of
the
waste
matter.
that's
called
concentrating.
well,
all
the
miners
do
that
and
they're
allowed
to
include
that
in
their
depletion
base.
the
point
i
would
make
about
this
ordinary
treatment
process
language
is
that
it
obviously
imposes
a
class
standard.
it
talks
about
the
ordinary
processes
normally
applied
by
mine
owners,
and
this
taxpayer
as
in
effect
contended
that
the
depletion
base
varies
from
taxpayer
to
taxpayer
within
the
same
class.
that
one
miner
of
fire
clay
and
shale
will
get
depletion
on
the
basis
of
fire
clay.
another,
if
he
doesn't
sell
fire
clay
and
can
--
so
he
couldn't
profitably
have
sold
it,
will
get
it
on
buff
bricks,
the
third
one
on
sewer
pipes
and
so
on.
we
have
other
cases
since
cannelton
in
which
the
same
contention
is
being
made
in
various
forms,
cases
in
which
a
miner
of
iron
ore
says
he
can't
sell
the
iron
ore
profitably.
he
wants
depletion
on
pig
iron.
we
have
a
case
in
which
a
salt
company
mines
salt
which
sells
for
around
$10
a
ton
as
naked
salt,
says
it
wouldn't
be
profitable
to
sell
it
in
that
form.
it
is
seeking
to
take
depletion
on
the
basis
of
the
value
of
small
in
--
salt
in
small
packages
as
it
is
ready
for
sale
on
the
supermarket
shelves,
and
so
computed
salt
has
a
value
close
to
$2
a
ton
in
the
smallest
packages.
there
are
cases
in
which
miners
of
lignite,
a
cheap
coal,
are
claiming
depletion
on
the
basis
of
activated
carbon,
which
is
worth
several
hundred
times
as
much.
now
that
is
economics.
they
--
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
now,
i'm
talking
about
the
statutory
definition,
the
main
part
of
the
definition,
but
there
is
something
more
that
goes
with
it.
congress
has
gone
on
after
this
language
relating
to
ordinary
treatment
processes,
and
this
about
one-third
of
the
way
down
on
page
94,
and
it
says
the
term
“ordinary
treatment
processes”
as
used
herein
shall
include
the
following.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
94
of
the
government's
opening
brief,
your
honor.
shall
include
the
following,
and
four
subparagraphs
follow.
now
before
i
get
into
the
rather
detailed
language
of
those
four
subparagraphs,
i'd
like
to
make
one
or
two
observations
about
them.we
agree
with
taxpayer
that
this
listing
does
not
purport
to
be
all
inclusive.
and
if
i
may
anticipate
for
a
moment
the
discussion
of
the
legislative
history
to
which
i
intend
to
come
later,
congress
stated
when
it
wrote
the
definition
of
mining
with
these
four
subparagraphs
included.
it
stated
in
the
senate
committee
report
that
these
subparagraphs
were
designed
as
a
reasonable
specification
of
various
processes
which
might
be
included
for
various
kinds
and
classes
of
mines.
i
emphasize
the
reasonable
specification
because
it
is
significant
when
we
consider
the
types
of
processes
which
have
been
authorized
and
i
emphasize
further
that
the
senate
report
referred
to
various,
kinds
and
classes
of
mines,
which
does
--
which
we
think
is
inconsistent
with
taxpayer's
view
that
individual
integrated
miners
can
get
widely
varying
depletion
bases
depending
on
the
particular
products
which
they
make
and
sell.
the
ordinary
treatment
processes
listed
by
congress
are
one
in
the
case
of
coal,
cleaning,
breaking,
sizing
and
loading
for
shipment.
now,
all
of
these
are
obviously
preparatory
processes,
getting
it
to
the
point
where
you're
ready
to
load
it
on
the
--
on
the
coal
cars.
the
last
of
them
is
loading
for
shipment,
and
coal
is
almost
invariably
broken
up
and
put
through
screens,
broken
and
sized
and
cleaned
before
it's
shipped.
that's
done
right
after
mine
or
at
the
mine
depot.
the
second
category
in
the
case
of
sulphur,
pumping
to
that
is
cooling,
breaking
and
again,
loading
for
shipment,
again,
we're
dealing
with
the
necessary
extractive
or
preparatory
processes.
these
are
the
--
the
processes
which
are
necessary
to
get
sulphur
out
of
the
ground
by
the
use
of
a
method
which
sulphur
miners
all
use
the
frasch
method.
indeed,
you
will
notice
as
i
go
through
these
four
subparagraphs
that
there
are
two
categories
of
processes
which
are
allowed.
the
one
separative
or
extractive
processes,
getting
the
valuable
constituent
out
of
the
mineral,
eliminating
the
waste
and
extraneous
matter.
the
other
preparatory
processes
to
get
it
in
shipping
grade
or
form,
breaking
it
up
so
it's
in
manageable
size
or
eliminating
excess
moisture,
crushing
it
if
that's
necessary.
well,
going
on
that
is
the
third
subparagraph.
this
relates
not
to
one
individual
mineral
but
to
a
number
of
specified
minerals,
and
then
to
a
class,
other
minerals
which
are
customarily
sold
in
the
form
of
a
crude
mineral
product.
and
as
to
those,
congress
has
said
that
the
miner,
if
he
uses
them,
may
take
depletion
on
assorting,
the
concentrating,
which
is
simply
getting
the
mineral
in
more
concentrated
form
and
sintering.
sintering
is
heating
up
the
dusty
particles
which
you
get
from
some
minerals
so
they'll
form
a
porous
clinker
because
obviously,
you
can't
ship
dust,
but
you
can
ship
clinkers.
all
--
again,
one
notes
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
the
mineral
to
shipping
grade
and
form
and
loading
for
shipment.
then
we
come
to
the
fourth
category.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
it's
customarily
sold
as
raw
clay
and
shale.
and
all
of
the
processes
here
are
obviously
of
the
type
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
anything
that
might
be
done
in
a
factory
of
any
kind.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
is
included
in
the
general
category
of
the
minerals
sold
in
the
form
of
the
crude
mineral
product.
in
that
sense,
it
comes
within
this
class.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
well,
there's
great
variation
from
mineral
to
mineral
as
to
what
you
have
to
do
to
--
to
get
them
ready.
as
we
know
that
in
case
of
coal,
they
clean
it,
oddly
enough.
the
fourth
category
relates
to
minerals
not
customarily
sold
in
the
form
of
crude
mineral
product.
there
are
various
metals
there
and
then
it
says,
“and
ore
is
not
customarily
sold
in
the
form
of
the
crude
mineral
product.”
and
as
to
those,
the
taxpayer
to
miner
is
allowed
to
include
a
variety
of
processes;
crushing,
grinding
and
beneficiation
by
concentration
then
various
other
methods
of
beneficiating
the
mineral
and
dropping
down
or
by
substantially
equivalent
processes
or
a
combination
of
processes
used
in
the
separation
or
extraction
of
the
product
or
products
from
the
ore.
so
again,
we
have
a
group
of
processes
which
are
separative
or
extractive
which
involve
getting
the
valuable
constituent
out
of
the
mine,
but
don't
involve
in
any
instance
the
kind
of
process
which
might
be
used
for
purposes
of
taking
that
valuable
constituent
and
then
making
it
into
a
new
and
different
product,
which
is
the
kind
of
processes
--
the
kind
of
process
which
this
taxpayer
would
include
in
its
depletion
base.
now,
there's
a
parenthetical
clause
in
subparagraph
(4),
which
is
important,
and
i'd
skipped
over
and
i
now
want
to
go
back
to
it.
but
not
including
--
not
including
as
an
ordinary
treatment
process,
electrolytic
deposition,
roasting,
thermal
or
electric
smelting
or
refining.
now,
this
is
highly
significant,
we
think.
and
the
reason
is
this.
when
depletion
was
first
granted,
and
i'm
again
anticipating
the
history
for
a
moment,
when
depletion
was
first
granted
in
relation
to
metals,
and
that
took
place
in
1932,
congress
was
informed
and
informed
at
length
that
most
of
the
metal
miners
were
integrated.
in
the
case
of
iron
ore,
it
was
pointed
out
that
more
than
90%
of
the
iron
ore
was
owned
or
controlled
by
companies
which
were
integrated,
and
that
was
about
the
same
for
copper.
it
was
also
pointed
out,
however,
that
there
were
small
miners
who
were
not
integrated
and
who
did
not
have
their
own
smelting
and
refining
works.
what
they
did
was
simply
to
come
get
the
mineral
in
fairly
concentrated
form
and
then
sell
what
is
called
the
ore
concentrate
to
a
so-called
custom
smelter
who
did
the
smelting
and
refining.
and
congress
was
persuaded
as
early
as
1932,
though
this
--
this
is
of
the
1943
statute.
but
congress
was
persuaded
as
early
as
1932.
it
indicated
in
its
reports
that
the
small
miner
who
didn't
have
these
works,
the
smelting
and
refining
works,
should
get
depletion
on
the
same
basis
as
the
big
ones
and
promptly
after
the
1932
act,
treasury
by
regulations,
specifically
for
forbade
the
inclusion
of
smelting
and
refining.
and
then
when
congress
wrote
this
detailed
definition,
which
we
have
in
the
1943
statute,
it
too,
following
the
prior
regulations
specifically
for
forbade
smelting
and
refining.
and
this
is
particularly
important,
we
think,
because
smelting
and
refining
is
obviously
a
great
deal
closer
to
normal
mining
operations
than
making
sewer
pipes
or
fancy
ceramics
in
a
--
in
a
factory.
yet
congress
excluded
it
because
it
was
convinced
that
had
it
allowed
smelting
and
refining,
it
would
have
caused
a
discrimination
as
between
the
small
miner
and
the
larger
miner,
and
it
decided
that
they
should
both
have
depletion
on
the
same
basis.
and
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
legislative
history
which
i've
anticipated
a
little,
but
i'd
like
to
go
back
and
sketch
the
entire
history
of
depletion.
obviously,
it
will
be
a
very
brief
sketch.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
get
the
idea
of
the
development
of
this,
in
mind,
because
each
of
the
statutes
has
dealt
pretty
much
on
the
predecessor.
a
mineral
depletion
actually
began,
though
not
percentage
depletion,
of
course,
with
the
first
income
tax
act
in
1913.
the
act
of
that
year
provided
that
there
should
be
allowed
as
a
deduction,
a
reasonable
allowance
for
the
exhaustion
of
property
not
to
exceed
in
the
case
of
mines,
5%
of
the
gross
value
at
the
mine
of
the
output
for
the
year.
that
point,
though,
has
no
provision
for
any
kind
of
processing
and
it
was
cost
to
depletion
and
was
the
value
at
the
mine.
the
regulations
which
were
promptly
promulgated
provided
that
if
the
market
value
of
the
product
of
the
mine
was
established
at
some
other
place
from
the
mine,
then
the
gross
value
was
to
be
reduced
by
the
cost
of
the
transportation,
the
reduction
and
the
smelting
charges.
and
thus,
at
the
very
outset
of
the
history,
there
is
in
the
regulations
an
attempt
to
exclude
specified
activities
which
are
not
closely
associated
with
the
extractive
process
but
might
be
performed
by
a
company
in
which
was
integrated.
of
course,
depletion
by
the
discovery
method
was
later
authorized
and
under
this
method,
we
went
from
cost
depletion
to
a
depletion
without
reference
to
cost.
under
discovery
depletion,
the
value
of
the
mine
at
the
time
of
discovery
was
estimated
and
then
once
its
fair
value
had
been
fixed
and
the
estimated
amount
of
minerals
in
place
had
been
determined,
the
miner
was
--
the
miner
established
a
per
unit
measure
of
depletion
and
he
applied
that
measure
to
the
number
of
units
removed
that
year.
the
next
change
after
discovery
depletion
came
in
was
in
1921
when
congress
placed
a
filling
on
the
annual
deduction
stating
that
it
might
not
exceed
in
the
case
of
any
taxpayer
his
net
income
from
the
property.
and
this
limitation
was
later
changed
in
1924
to
a
so-called
50%
net
income
limitation.
he
couldn't
claim
depletion
in
any
year
more
than
--
above
50%
of
his
net
income
from
the
property.
now
once
congress
imposed
this
net
income
limitation,
which
has
persisted
incidentally
under
percentage
depletions,
as
well,
it
became
immediately
necessary,
in
order
to
apply
that
limitation,
for
taxpayers
to
distinguish
between
their
gross
income
from
mining
or
their
net
income
from
mining,
as
the
case
might
be,
and
their
income
from
other
sources
in
the
exact
same
way
as
necessary
under
the
present
statute
to
determine
what
its
gross
income
from
mining
and
what
is
gross
income
from
some
other
activity
such
as
sewer
pipe
making,
which
the
miner
may
also
happen
to
be
engaged
in.
now
in
1922,
the
treasury
regulations
provided,
if
the
mineral
products
are
not
sold
as
raw
material
but
are
manufactured
or
converted
into
a
refined
product,
then
the
gross
income
shall
be
assumed
to
be
equivalent
to
the
market
or
field
price
of
the
raw
material
before
conversion.
in
1926,
congress
went
on
and
established
depletion
at
that
time
only
for
oil
and
gas,
and
regulations
promptly
promulgated
in
1927
provided
in
substance
the
same
as
the
earlier
regulations
they
held
that
the
oil
and
gas
producer
who
also
transported
or
distributed
or
engaged
in
further
activities
would
be
held
to
the
field,
post-field
price.
he
couldn't
go
beyond
that.
finally,
in
1932,
after
numerous
proposals
had
been
made
to
it,
congress
extended
percentage
depletion
to
coal,
sulphur
and
to
the
metal
mines.
and
up
until
this
point,
depletion
had
been
phrased
simply
in
terms
--
the
depletion
base
had
been
phrased
simply
in
terms
of
the
gross
income
from
the
property,
that
is
gross
income
from
the
mining
property.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
is
1932,
your
honor,
when
it
was
first
extended
to
minerals
other
than
oil
and
gas.
now,
at
these
hearings,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
emphasis
was
made
upon
the
fact
that
the
producers
of
many
of
these
minerals
were
integrated,
but
there
were
small
producers
who
were
not.
for
example,
the
representative
of
the
american
smelting
and
refining
company
was
one
of
the
people
who
came
before
the
congress
at
these
extensive
hearings.
and
we've
collected
all
of
the
legislative
materials
on
which
we're
relying
in
the
case
in
this
larger
volume.
and
as
he
argued,
he
testified
and
i'm
looking
at
page
102,
immediately
after
the
asterisks
about
a
third
of
the
way
down.
he
testified
that
where
the
taxpayer's
interests
are
varied
as
in
the
case
of
large
mining
companies,
there
is
i
believe,
no
doubt
that
as
a
rule,
its
books
reflect
the
result
of
each
operation,
which
make
it
possible
for
the
taxpayer
to
determine
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
bureau
the
portion
of
the
income
applicable
to
mining.
and
as
his
whole
line
of
testimony
shows
--
i
will
not
go
into
it
further
--
he
insisted
that
it
would
be
perfectly
practicable
in
the
case
of
the
integrated
producer
to
determine
the
basic
mineral
product
and
to
put
a
value
upon
it
so
that
the
small
man
who
didn't
do
his
own
smelting
and
refining
but
sold
to
concentrate
would
just
take
it
on
the
same
basis
as
the
large
operator
who
would
also
have
to
put
a
value
on
the
mineral
concentrate
and
not
compute
depletion
after
the
smelting
and
refining
had
been
completed.
now,
promptly
after
the
1932
statute
was
enacted,
treasury
promulgated
regulations,
after
extensive
conferences
with
the
mining
industry,
and
those
regulations
appear
in
this
large
appendix
at
136.
and
what
treasury
did
was
to
list
in
the
regulations
a
number
of
processes
which
it
would
allow.
and
this
listing
and
you'll
note
the
four
subparagraphs,
is
closely
similar
to
the
listing
which
later
became
in
1943,
a
part
of
the
statute.
congress
made
13
additions
and
modifications
of
this
in
1943.
but
this
listing
was
largely
adopted
and
codified
by
congress,
and
you'll
note
without
my
taking
a
time
to
go
through
these
that
these
are
again
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
this
was
the
first
set
of
regulations,
your
honor,
following
the
extension
of
depletion
to
the
metals.
prior
to
that,
we
only
had
regulations
for
oil
and
gas
which
didn't
need
any
treatment
as
it
came
out
of
the
ground.
now,
as
i
have
indicated,
it
was
in
1943
that
we
first
got
the
--
the
elaborate
definition
in
the
statute.
the
1932
statute
merely
said
that
depletion
would
be
of
such
certain
percentage
computed
on
the
gross
income
from
the
property.
in
1943,
we
got
the
definition
of
mining
in
the
statute,
which
i
attempted
to
analyze
at
the
outset
of
the
argument.
now,
what
were
the
circumstances
that
led
congress
to
write
a
fuller
definition?
well,
the
mining
industry
had
come
to
congress
in
the
early
1940s
with
two
complaints.
one,
which
congress
concluded
was
a
valid
complaint.
and
i'll
concentrate
on
that
one.
the
complaint
was
that
the
treasury
had
been
unduly
restrictive
in
applying
the
1932
regulations
and
particularly,
that
was
alleged
in
the
case
of
two
types
of
miners.
you'll
note,
reverting
to
page
136,
where
we
set
out
this
1932
regulations
that
the
fourth
category
of
the
treasury
regulations
allowed
for
concentrating
and
other
processes
to
the
extent
to
which
they
do
not
beneficiate
the
product
in
greater
degree
than
crushing
and
concentrating.
well,
the
controversy
was
about
the
coverage
of
those
words,
“other
processes.”
two
groups
of
miners
came
to
congress,
primarily
gold
miners
and
quicksilver
miners,
and
said
that
some
miners
of
the
--
of
gold
used
processes
other
than
the
physical
concentration
process
whereby
you
eliminate
the
waste
specifically.
some
used
chemical
methods
of
separating
the
waste
in
getting
the
gold
out.
and
these
miners
said
that
treasury
had
originally
allowed
this
treatment
process
but
that
in
1940,
it
began
disallowing
it.
and
the
controversy
between
the
miners
and
the
treasury
was
as
to
whether
this
chemical
method
called
cyanidation
of
gold
was
or
was
not
substantially
equivalent
to
the
physical
concentration
methods
which
other
miners
mining
different
types
of
deposits
used.
and
the
mining
industry
represented
that
these
processes
were
substantially
equivalent
and
that
treasury
had
been
applying
the
regulation
in
this
respect
to
narrowly.
similarly,
the
miners,
this
quicksilver
said
that
the
treasury
had
erroneously
decided
that
it
would
not
allow
the
furnacing
of
quicksilver,
which
is
simply
taking
the
--
the
ore
in
which
quicksilver
is
found
and
putting
it
into
a
simple
retort
and
heating
it.
these
miners
said
that
the
furnacing
of
quicksilver
was
equivalent
to
concentration
was
necessary
to
get
the
quicksilver
out
of
the
cinnabar
ore
and
that
it
should
be
allowed
as
coming
within
these
words
other
processes.
but
all
of
those
people
who
came
forward
emphasized
that
they
were
seeking
the
allowance
of
processes
which
were
extractive
in
nature
and
which
were
substantially
equivalent
to
those
which
were
already
being
allowed.
and
they
emphasized
further
that
they
were
not
seeking
the
allowance
of
any
process
which
was
essentially
a
manufacturing
or
a
refining
process.
indeed,
the
representative
of
the
quicksilver
miners
was
mr.
david
searls
who
has
represented
minimal
interest
in
this
court
on
numerous
occasions.
and
he
said,
at
166
of
our
appendix,
obviously,
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
that
those
processes
which
would
take
your
products
and
make
them
into
different
products,
having
very
different
uses,
should
be
considered
as
the
basis
of
depletion.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
who
is
he?
he
was
the
--
speaking
for
the
quicksilver
miners,
and
he
was
saying
that
furnacing
of
quicksilver
should
be
allowed.
that
he
was
making
clear
that
he
was
asking
it
on
the
basis
that
furnacing
was
necessary
as
an
extractive
process
and
he
wasn't
claiming
that
anything
in
the
nature
of
smelting
or
refining
or
manufacturing
ought
to
be
allowed.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
he
was
the
industry
representative
for
the
congress.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
he's
the
lawyer
for
the
mineral
representatives.
he
also
says
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
same
page
speaking
of
smelting
and
refining
and
the
like,
i
see
no
reason
for
giving
the
big
fellow
that
has
all
those
big
works
any
better
or
any
worse
field
than
the
little
fellow
who
hasn't
got
them.
i
say
that
the
refining
process
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
depletion.
that
he
was
distinguishing,
furnacing
of
quicksilver
from
refining.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
was
speaking
for
the
representatives
of
the
--
he
was
speaking
for
the
quicksilver
miners
to
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
ask
congress
to
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
provide
that
furnacing
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
the
congress
agreed
as
i
shall
point
out
the
--
in
a
moment
with
the
request
for
changes
made,
and
i
want
to
point
out
what
it
said
when
it
made
these
changes.
congress,
as
i
say,
made
its
own
listing
in
1943
and
it
added
to
this
subparagraph
(4),
cyanidation
of
gold
and
furnacing
of
quicksilver
and
other
equivalent
processes
that
accepted
the
view
of
the
representatives
of
those
industries
that
these
were
substantially
equivalent
processes
to
those
which
were
already
allowed,
and
it
then
said,
and
this
is
from
the
report.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
read
from
page
--
it's
quoted
in
part
at
page
62
and
63
of
the
government's
opening
brief.
you'll
notice
the
bottom
at
62
when
it's
talking
about
these
processes
it
has
listed.
it
says
the
purpose
is
to
make
certain
that
the
ordinary
treatment
processes
which
a
mine
owner
would
normally
apply
to
obtain
a
marketable
product
should
be
considered
as
a
part
of
the
mining
operation
and
to
give
reasonable
specification
of
what
ought
to
be
considered
such
processes
for
various
kinds
or
classes
of
mines.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
on
page
62
and
63
of
the
government's
opening
brief.
and
then
it
goes
on
and
says
that
the
definition
here
prescribed
expresses
the
congressional
intent
of
these
provisions
as
first
included
in
the
law
and
is
in
accord
with
the
--
with
the
original
regulations
and
the
bureau
practices
and
procedures
thereunder.
so
that
in
sum,
congress
in
1943
concluded
that
it
agreed
with
the
treasury
regulations.
that
it
was
going
to
make
several
modifications
to
make
certain
that
they
were
not
too
restrictively
applied
because
it
felt
that
they
had
been
in
respect
to
certain
processes
which,
it's
deemed
equivalent
to
others.
and
with
that
modification
is
approved
by
our
treasury
practice.
since
1943,
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
nobody
ever
suggested
depletion
on
finished
products.
the
argument
frequently
and
many
branches
of
the
mining
industry
came
before
congress
because
after
1943,
it
was
extended
to
more
and
more
minerals.
at
first,
only
the
metals
got
it,
and
coal
and
sulphur,
later
on
other
nonmetallic
minerals.
representatives
of
every
branch
in
the
mining
industry
came
to
congress,
and
each
attempted
to
show
what
would
be
the
ordinary
processes
which
it
would
have
to
use
to
put
its
mineral
in
marketable
conditions,
and
most
of
them
referred
to
the
mineral
product
which
they
would
get
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
but
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
the
marketable
product
that
they
are
talking
about
is
the
product
of
the
mine
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
from
1916
on,
congress
has
referred
to
the
mineral
as
the
product
of
the
mine
and
the
regulations
that
treated
mineral
as
the
product
as
referring
to
the
mineral
and
the
commercially
marketable
product
in
our
view
is
the
mineral
in
marketable
condition.
for
example
is,
in
our
appendix
b,
you'll
find
the
1963
act
on
page
3.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
in
the
case
of
mines,
a
reasonable
allowance
for
depletion
--
this
is
the
top
of
three,
not
to
exceed
the
market
value
in
the
mine
of
the
product
thereof.
i'm
just
pointing
to
that
--
that
1916
language
to
show
that
from
the
earliest,
this
word
product
has
been
used
in
connection
with
the
mineral.
and
indeed
in
subparagraph
(4),
of
the
present
statute,
that's
on
page
94.
you'll
notice
that
congress
in
subparagraph
(4)
speaks
of
the
processes
used
in
the
separation
or
extraction
of
the
product
or
products
from
the
ore.
so
by
product,
it
means
the
valuable
constituent
of
the
mineral
extracted
and
freed
from
the
waste
and
impurities
and
other
matter
which
--
with
which
it
is
found
in
nature.
since
1943,
the
criterion
of
the
statute
has
remained
unchanged,
and
the
1943
act
which
we
have
it
here
controls
in
this
case.
now,
i
had
told
justice
harlan
a
moment
ago
that
--
that
nobody
suggested
depletion
on
the
basis
of
finished
manufactured
products.
and
we
have
attached
to
the
back
of
this
appendix
a
--
a
chart.
it
follows
the
last
page
of
the
appendix.
in
this
chart,
attempts
to
set
out
in
summary
form
the
various
types
of
minerals
and
a
product
on
which
percentage
depletion
was
sought
by
the
people
who
were
receiving
it
in
congress.
the
processes
which
they
told
congress
they
ought
to
be
allowed
and
the
product
which
they
said
would
result
from
the
use
of
these
processes,
what
they
said
would
be
the
marketable
product
and
in
the
right
hand
column,
we
have
a
list
of
all
of
the
legislative
references.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
--
this
is
what
the
industry
people
thought
when
they
asked
for
depletion.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.generally
in
many
instance,
it
usually
would
be
the
people
who
came
were
usually
the
mining
associations
and
the
most
important
spokesman
before
congress
was
the
american
mining
congress.
i
obviously
cannot
go
through
branch
by
branch
what
the
various
representatives
told
congress,
but
we
find
no
instance
in
which
the
representatives
of
any
branch
contended
that
depletion
should
be
taken
on
the
basis
of
finished
manufactured
products.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
had
permitted
that?
no,
no.
the
regulations
have
--
the
first
regulations
were
these
1932
regulations
i
read,
your
honor
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
at
page
136,
and
they
are
all
the
processes
which
they're
allowed
or
as
taxpayer
would
agree,
separation
processes
or
preliminary
processes
which
you
use
to
get
a
mineral
in
the
--
in
shipping
grade
or
form.
none
of
those
processes
obviously
would
take
in
the
processes
or
the
activities
which
might
--
one
might
perform
in
a
factory.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
first
group
of
cases
in
which
that
was
allowed
were
the
so-called
brick
and
tile
cases
in
which
the
courts
--
lower
courts
concluded
that
the
miners
of
brick
and
tile
clay
could
take
depletion
on
bricks
rather
than
on
brick
and
tile
clay.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
first
of
those
was
in
about
1955,
your
honor.
and
that
was
the
--
the
cherokee
case
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
--
under
my
view
of
the
statute,
that
was
erroneous
because
i
would
say
--
but
let
me
pause
a
moment.
our
view
of
the
statute
goes
so
far
as
to
lead
us
to
conclude
that
that
was
wrong,
but
i
hasten
to
point
out,
that
is
a
very
different
case
from
what
we
have
here
because
in
those
cases,
it
was
found
or
assumed
on
the
pleadings
that
there
were
no
sales
by
anyone
concerned
of
the
brick
and
tile
clay.
that
it
was
too
costly
for
it
to
be
worthwhile
for
anybody
to
ship
it,
and
so
plentiful
that
everybody
wanted
to
use
it
bought
a
piece
of
land
and
mined
his
own.
and
those
cases
rested
on
the
conclusion
that
there
was
--
there
were
no
sales
and
there
was
no
market
for
brick
and
tile
clay
and
hence,
the
first
marketable
product
was
brick.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
that
by
ordinary
treatment
processes
normally
applied
by
mine
owners
to
obtain
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
think
that
depletion
need
be
or
should
be
suddenly
and
greatly
enhanced.
if
all
of
the
members
of
a
particular
mining
industry
overnight
become
integrated,
because
i
think
congress
is
referring
to
the
ordinary
treatment
processes
used
by
miners
in
their
capacity
as
miners.
however,
if
the
statute
should
be
read
as
imposing
the
necessity
upon
--
imposing
the
necessity
that
the
government
show
some
sales
in
order
to
show
that
the
product
is
commercially
valuable
or
commercially
marketable,
and
for
that
reason,
that
the
brick
and
tile
clay
cases
are
correct.
if
that
should
be
held,
it
would
not
avail
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
because
it
is
committed
to
the
position
that
even
though
fire
clay
is
widely
sold
and
the
nonintegrated
miners
of
it
are
taking
depletion
on
the
raw
mineral,
it
nonetheless,
because
it
has
a
high
cost
mine
and
is
badly
located
from
the
standpoint
of
selling
fire
clay
and
shale
if
it
wished
to
do
so,
that
it
can
go
on
and
take
depletion
on
a
basis
20
times
greater
than
all
the
members
of
the
same
class,
all
the
other
miners
of
the
same
class
who
are
nonintegrated.
that
is
the
factual
and
legal
difference
between
the
earlier
line
of
cases
represented
by
merry
brothers
in
which
this
court
--
in
which
government
petition
in
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
that
group
of
cases.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
has
found
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
you
have
no
problem
in
this
case
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
that
there
are
substantial
sales
and
the
government
proved
marketability
in
the
sense
that
there
was
a
regular
traffic.
it
found
that
in
it's
--
and
there's
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
found
in
relation
to
indiana
that
300,000
tons,
out
of
500,000
tons
of
fire
clay
and
shale
were
--
were
sold
rather
than
used
by
integrated
producers.
let
me
refer,
your
honor,
a
moment
to
the
opinion
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
court's
findings
are
in
relation
to
indiana
and
they
appear
on
page
270.
the
court
says
about
halfway
down,
the
government
did
not
admit
in
this
case
the
non-marketability
of
fire
clay
and
shale.
it's
distinguishing
this
case
from
the
brick
and
tile
clay
cases.
indeed,
it
says,
“the
government's
evidence
indicates
that
large
quantities
of
fire
clay
and
shale
were
sold
during
the
tax
year
1951.”
and
then
it
goes
on
that
in
indiana,
the
82
companies
engaged
in
production
of
fire
clay
and
shale,
32
of
them
purchased
for
use
in
their
manufacturing
operations.
so,
that
would
mean
that
32
were
mining
it
in
order
to
sell
it.
and
then
it
goes
on
at
the
top
of
271
and
it
points
to
those
figures
300,000
and
500,000
to
which
i
earlier
referred.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
the
case
of
most
of
the
minerals,
the
representatives
of
the
mining
industry
themselves
made
very
clear
what
the
basic
mineral
product
was.
what
the
object
of
mining
was.
in
the
case
of
coal
mines,
it's
obviously
coal.
and
if
the
--
the
clay
people
came
to
congress,
and
i'd
like
to
refer
the
court
to
340
of
our
appendix.
they
told
congress
what
they
were
seeking
depletion
on.
you'll
see
a
little
chart
at
the
top
of
that
page.
this
is
an
exhibit
that
was
submitted
by
the
refractories
institute
when
it
was
speaking
depletion
on
refractory
clay.
most
fire
clay
is
refractory.
now,
you'll
notice
that
they
told
the
congress
in
this
exhibit
how
many
manufacturing
establishments
were
using
this
clay
and
then
they
lift
the
value
of
the
clay,
then
they
lift
the
raw
--
the
raw
materials
used,
we
have
then
in
italics
value,
$29
million.
i'm
looking
under
the
heading
1947.
then
they
say,
“estimated
depletion
allowance
15%
of
value,
15%
of
the
value
of
the
raw
material,
that's
what
was
sought.
what
we
have
here
is
the
case
where
the
raw
materials
are
worth
about
$2
a
ton,
but
the
depletion
is
sought
on
something
that
has
suddenly
multiplied
and
become
worth
$40
a
ton.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice.
taxpayers'
argument
assumes
throughout
that
congress,
in
using
the
words
“commercially
marketable
mineral
product”,
was
undertaken
to
guarantee,
everybody
who
engaged
in
mining,
a
profit
on
his
end
product.
and
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
brick
and
tile
manufacturers
has
been
held
in
cases
in
which
the
government
sought
certiorari,
that
they
may
take
depletion
on
brick
on
an
expressed
determination
that
the
government
could
not
show
and
had
not
shown
that
brick
and
tile
clay
was
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
sufficiently
valuable
to
be
sold.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
the
merry
brothers
line
of
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
petitioned
for
certiorari
after
we
lost
them.
since
certiorari
has
denied,
the
commissioner
has
not
further
litigated
brick
and
tile
cases.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
misfortune
had
been
compounded
by
the
fact
that
we'd
lost
it
in
several
circuits,
your
honor,
and
the
--
the
commissioner
did
not
feel
that
he
would
continue
to
attempt
to
apply
it
in
some
of
the
circuits
whereas
the
way
was
already
barred
in
others.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
was
assumed
on
the
pleadings.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
it
was
not
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
marketable
in
the
sense
that
there
was
any
proof
of
actual
sale.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
were
--
we
concluded
in
that
the
lawyers
who
handled
that
litigation
concluded
that
they
could
not
show
sales
of
brick
clay.
brick
clay
is
so
plentiful
that
if
anybody
wants
to
make
brick,
he
simply
locates
his
kiln
next
to
some
clay
and
digs
it
out
himself,
and
there's
no
commerce
in
it
and
--
or
at
most,
an
extremely
negligible
commerce.
the
courts
concluded
in
those
cases
that
all
members
of
the
class
would
be
treated
alike
and
that
all
of
them
would
get
depletion
on
brick.
none
of
those
cases
implied
that
if
there
were
proof
of
a
commercially
valuable
product,
proof
in
the
form
of
sales
at
a
stage,
in
advance,
of
the
manufactured
product
that
some
would
be
able
to
go
on
to
the
advanced
product
and
some
would
be
restricted
to
the
less
advanced
product.
in
the
fifth
circuit,
indeed,
as
recently
indicated
in
the
alabama
byproduct
case
which
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief,
that
it
conceives
of
this
as
an
industry-wide
text
and
it
went
in
the
brick
and
tile
cases
on
the
premise
that
in
that
industry,
there
was
no
commercially
valuable
material
until
you
got
brick.
i
think
that
analysis
may
be
wrong,
but
it's
quite
different
from
the
case
in
which
you
have
proof,
that
you
have
a
commercially
valuable
product
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
in
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
is
already
sold.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
bureau
of
mines'
figures
show
that
it's
sold
in
substantial
quantities
on
a
national
scale.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
have
the
figures
fully
set
out
and
it
is
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
certainly
substantial,
very
substantial
in
volume
though
it
would
be
less
than
half
as
i
recall
the
figures
for
the
--
of
the
total
production.
that
there
is
more
than
half
is
mined
by
integrated
producers.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
has
always
been
taken
care
of
in
regulations,
your
honor,
and
i
have
to
go
through
several
steps.
from
the
beginning,
from
1940,
there
have
been
complete
regulations
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
as
to
the
integrated
producer.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
in
this
case,
if
the
taxpayer
had
sold
any
clay,
that
would
determine
and
if
it
were
a
superior
grade,
presumably
the
price
would
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
but
they
don't
sell.
the
regulations
provide
that
in
the
case
of
an
integrated
producer
who
does
not
sell
that
you
then
apply
the
representative
market
price
for
the
mineral
of
like
kind
and
grade.
now,
if
the
court
found
--
this
was
litigated
but
not
decided
because
the
court
concluded
that
the
depletable
product
was
sewer
pipe.
if
the
court
had
found,
as
dean
griswold
suggests
that
the
cannelton
clay
was
a
very
superior
clay,
then
--
and
if
there
was
no
representative
market
price
for
clay
of
that
kind,
then
a
further
provision
of
the
regulation
would
come
into
play.
and
that
provision
provides
a
so-called
proportionate
profits
test.
and
that
test
is
as
follows.
if
it
be
we
take
some
figures
to
make
this
simpler
to
follow,
let's
assume
that
cannelton's
mining
costs
are
$2.
let's
assume,
further
that,
its
other
cost,
its
factory
costs
are
$18,
nine
times
as
much,
so
that
one-tenth
represents
the
mining
cost
and
nine
tenths,
the
non-mining
cost.
the
regulations
provide
as
they
have
for
many,
many
years
that
in
that
instance,
you
take
one-tenth
which
represents
the
mining
cost
of
the
price
of
the
ultimate
product
sold
which
would
be
one-tenth
of
$40.
and
you
would
get
then
a
depletion
base
of
$4.
and
you
would
apply
to
that
$4.
that's
not
the
allowance.
that's
the
(inaudible)
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
then
you'd
apply
the
statutory
percentage
and
you'd
get
44
cents.
that
would
be
--
to
get
to
the
real
heart
of
this
case,
the
thing
that
i
would
like
to
leave
with
the
court
is
this.
that
congress
was
not
interested
in
defining
mining,
in
providing
an
avenue
for
producers
to
go
on
to
manufacturing.
it
didn't
use
the
words
“commercially
marketable
mineral
product”
for
that
purpose
or
in
that
sense.
congress
recognized
that
because
of
the
nature
of
most
mineral
deposits,
you've
got
to
do
some
mineral
treatment,
treatment
which
the
mining
industry
does,
in
order
to
get
realizable
value.
some
of
the
ore,
some
of
the
rocks,
which
may
they
picked
up
are
waste,
are
worthless
unless
they're
deficient
--
unless
they're
treated,
they're
not
worth
shipping.
the
miner
of
a
low
grade
iron
ore
has
to
break
it
up
and
concentrate
it
to
be
worth
the
freight.
now,
congress
decided
that
it
should
allow
all
miners
to
include
those
processes
which
they
would
use
as
miners
in
order
to
get
the
valuable
constituent
out
and
to
put
it
in
--
in
a
form
where
it
would
be
of
shipping
grade
and
quality.
now,
this
isn't
a
mystery.
this
statute
has
four
subparagraphs
which
tell
you
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
was
talking
about
treatment
processes.
and
every
one
of
them
involves
getting
the
valuable
constituent
out
of
the
ore
or
in
some
cases,
doing
some
preliminary
preparation
such
as
breaking
it
up
into
pieces
where
you
can
load
it
on
the
coal
car.
and
the
marketable
mineral
product
that
congress
is
talking
about
is
the
valuable
constituent
of
the
mine
and
it
proposed
to
treat
each
class
of
mine
in
accordance
with
what
that
class
of
mine
was
after,
what
it
was
engaged
in
getting
out
of
the
deposit
and
to
allow
depletion
on
that
basis.
i
suggest
that
it
is
baseless
to
the
tribute
to
the
government,
a
purpose
of
wiping
out
all
ordinary
treatment
processes.
the
chart
which
appears
at
the
back
of
our
appendix
shows
the
processes
which
different
miners
use.
as
it
happens,
we
have
here
a
clay
which
comes
unmixed
with
dirt
and
is
salable
and
is
sold
as
you
dig
it
out
of
the
ground,
but
the
miner
of
metal
has
to
use
the
various
concentration
processes
to
get
his
mineral
concentrate.
now,
the
consistent
purpose
of
congress
to
avoid
discrimination
as
between
members
of
the
same
class,
miners
of
the
same
kind
is
evident
throughout
this
whole
history
and
this
is
indeed
not
the
view
of
the
government
alone.
we
have
here
a
brief
from
the
national
coal
association,
as
--
as
amicus
in
this
case
to
which
i
hope
to
refer
if
i
can
locate
it
among
all
of
my
papers.
well,
i
won't
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
wanted
to
point
out
what
the
national
coal
association
says
about
what
this
legislative
history
and
this
specification
of
processes
show.
and
i'm
reading
from
page
15
of
the
coal
association's
brief.
the
processes
enumerated
which
were
allowed
to
be
applied
to
increase
the
value
of
the
capital
which
was
allowed
tax-free
recoupment
were
clearly
of
the
type
which
were
regarded
as
processes
which
resulted
in
a
product
of
a
mine,
i.e.
mineral
concentrate,
as
distinguished
from
a
manufactured
or
refined
product.
your
honor,
what's
that?
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
we
did.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
congress
held
hearings.
it
heard
various
views.
the
american
mining
congress,
at
those
hearings,
acknowledged
and
quoted
the
statement
in
our
reply
brief
from
the
chairman
of
their
tax
committee
that
recent
cases
had
gone
far
beyond
the
original
concept
of
depletion,
so
this
view
of
the
statute
isn't
ours
alone.
we
didn't
get
legislation
but
dean
griswold
has
neglected
to
mention
the
reason.
after
the
hearings
were
concluded,
the
chairman
of
the
ways
and
means
committee
told
the
congress
that
though
the
hearings
had
been
held,
the
committee
did
not
intend
to
take
any
further
action
because
the
matter
of
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
as
it
stood,
was
before
this
court
in
this
case.
thank
you.
