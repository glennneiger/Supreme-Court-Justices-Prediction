where,
mr.
spritzer,
if
i
may
ask
if
you
understand,
does
the
court
of
appeals
get
this
basis
or
this
concept
in
profit?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
go
on.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
because
you'll
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
mean
by
that
(inaudible)
it
has
to
specify
with
particularity
the
various
arguments
to
sustain
a
particular
point
or
is
foreclosed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
might
i
ask
you
there
sir?
do
you
conceive
that
the
phrase
on
the
one
hand,
marketable
product,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
phrase
products
for
which
there
is
a
market
are
different
concepts?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right,
commercially
marketable
product.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
was
some
mention
of
it,
but
in
any
case,
are
--
is
it
the
same
concept
to
think
of
a
commercially
marketable
product
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand,
a
product
for
which
there
is
a
market.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
it
might
--
obviously.
it
might
be
--
that
it
might
be
the
type
of
article
which
in
one
place
would
be
readily
--
would
meet
a
ready
market,
but
in
some
other
place,
there
would
be
no
market
for
it,
but
the
article
itself
is
the
same
in
either
place.
now
then,
would
it
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what's
the
difference
between
tons
of
this
clay
at
one
point
in
indiana,
or
how
did
you
(inaudible)
as
the
product.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
wonder
what
your
view
might
be
of
this.
if
a
--
such
a
minor
manufacturer
may
go
on
with
these
processes
until
he
reaches
something
that
is
salable
at
a
profit.
suppose
he
never
reaches
a
profit
then
is
he
denied
any
deduction
at
all?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
he
may
have
some
other
things.
