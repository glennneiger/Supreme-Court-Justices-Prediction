what

this?

chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
congress
intended
that
you
should
get
a
--
greater
depletion
value
than
you
could
--
than
you
could
go
up
and
buy
the
product
in
the
market
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
dean,
i
--
i
understood
mr.
spritzer
to
say
that
300,000
out
of
500,000
tons
of
shale
and
--
and
clay
that
are
mined
in
indiana
are
--
are
sold
by
the
--
the
miners
and
--
and
that
the
average
was
about
$1.60
a
ton
and
that
on
the
average,
they
would
get
about
11
cents
--
11
cents
a
ton,
now
depletion.
now,
does
that
and
do
you
mean
that
according
to
your
theory,
that's
all
those
miners
would
get
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
that
you
--
you
because
you
have
a
plant
alongside
of
--
of
your
mine
would
get
a
depletion
based
upon
$40
because
--
a
ton,
because
that's
the
--
the
value
of
your
completed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
weren't
big
enough
to
--
to
have
an
integrated
plant,
then
congress
intended
that
you
should
only
get
about
a
--
15
or
16
cents
where
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
other
in
your
situation,
you
get
about
$4.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
thought
--
well,
we
can
suppose,
we
can
suppose,
i
guess,
a
man
who
does
have
--
does
mine
shale
and
--
and
clay
and
who
doesn't
have
the
means
to
--
to
build
an
integrated
plant
and
he
has
to
--
he
has
to
sell
it.
it's
the
only
way
he
can
transact
his
business.
he
would
get
about
11
cents
a
ton
and
you'll
get
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
get
$4.
