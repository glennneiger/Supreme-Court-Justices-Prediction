under

system?
justice

that
would
fall
under
criteria,
would
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
on
your
assumption,
it
--
on
the
assumption
that
you've
stated,
and
why
do
you
think
it
was
wrong?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
nobody
in
the
industry
--
although
nobody
in
the
industry
did
it.
justice

assume
that
you
agree
that
if
nobody
does
it
as
ordinary,
do
we
have
to
face
in
this
--
on
your
theory,
do
we
have
to
face
in
this
case
what
constitutes
--
what
participation
in
the
both
in
the
early
sale,
the
earliest
sale
as
a
mining
product,
what
percentage
of
the
industry
is

(voice

geographically
and
quantitatively,
what
(inaudible)
justice

frankfurter
in
--
in
indiana
or
in
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
not
in
this
case,
but
on
your
--
even
on
your
theory,
some
individualization
--
some
problems
of
individualization
would
be
raised
as
indicated
by
my
question,
statewide
industry,
nationwide
industry,
what
percentage
constitute
the
industry?
those
questions
would
still
be,
or
wouldn't
it?

paragraph

conceal
the
very
conflict
which
is
now
before
us,
namely,
as
to
what
the
content
of
the
scope
of
"commercially
marketable
product
or
products"
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
that
because
you
indicate
that
that
would
be
the
statute.you
accept
mr.
spritzer's
starting
off
point,
his
standard,
namely,
that
is
the
ordinary
conduct
of
the
industry
in
your
case
industry
predominantly
percentage-wise
throughout
the
united
states
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
in
those
assessment,
there
is
also
a
function
of
the
--
of
the
ordinary
practice
which
means
industry
practice,
whatever
that
means,
isn't
that
right?
and
not
merely
the
individualized
idiosyncratic
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
general
--
the
general
--
that
utilization
of
the
general
behavior
in
the
industry
becomes
part
of
what
he's
entitled
to
do
in
his
individual
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
mean
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
if
whether
it
was
assumed
that
it
was
determined,
you
said
it
was
determined.
was
it
determined
that
you
couldn't
make
who,
that
it
was
commercially
marketable
or
that
in
the
particular
cases
you
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
but
--
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
weren't
foreclosed
by
the
pleadings
to
start
a
case
in
which
you
could
prove
the
fact
for
you
in
some
other
case.
justice

frankfurter
--
in
brazil?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
it
in
brazil
but
are
the
bureau
of
mines'
figures
in
this
case
as
to
this
product,
as
to
this
mine,
as
to
this
mineral
too,
were
dependable?
justice

but
was
it
substantial
in
volume
or
in
percentage
of
the
industry,
what
is
the
prevailing
