if
it
had
ended
up
with
bricks,
instead
of

bricks
would
sold
at
$3
a

and
make
a
profit.
justice
william
j.

that
would
have
been
the

i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
harlan.
justice

the
only
product
it

yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

now,
may
i
ask,
do
you
suggest
that
this
mineral
comes
within
that
subdivision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understood
you
though,
mr.
spritzer,
there's
no
sorting
or
concentrating
or
sintering
involved,
is
there,
as
to
this

justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
as
to
this
particular

but
as
to
this
particular
mineral,
none
of
those
things.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
the
court
of
appeals
opinion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
industry-wide,
mr.
spritzer,
or
was
that
just
in
indiana?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
just
shows
my
ignorance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
in
the
--
are
the
integrated
brick
manufacturers
using
this
process?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
something
the
integrated
fellow
who,
i
take
this
on
the
end
product
basis.

the
fellow
who
buys
the

if
they
buy
the

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
must
say,
dean,
i
didn't
understand
mr.
spritzer
to
say
that.
i
thought
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
all
that
he
said
was

maybe
there
is
an
inconsistency
but
i
wasn't
quite
clear
if
that
was
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
tell
me,
mr.
spritzer,
is
it
the
fact
that
the
brick
