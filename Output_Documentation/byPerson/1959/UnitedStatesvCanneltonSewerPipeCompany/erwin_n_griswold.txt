mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
on
the
merits
in
this
case
is
solely
one
of
statutory
construction.
there's
no
constitutional
question.
by
call
of
presence
of
interpretation
that
has
many
facets,
but
the
touchstone
i
think
is
to
be
found
in
the
way
the
statute
is
actually
written.
if
the
words
which
congress
used
are
carefully
examined
and
then
applied,
the
result
to
which
they
point
may
be
tolerably
clear.
before
going
to
the
statute
in
detail,
it's
helpful,
i
think,
to
clear
away
some
possible
basis
from
misunderstanding.
in
the
first
place,
although
the
statute
is
one
which
deals
with
depletion
of
minerals,
the
allowance
made
by
congress
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
actual
cost
or
the
loss
or
expenditure
sustained
by
the
owner
from
the
use
of
his
materials.
one
would
expect
that
the
depletion
allowance
would
have
something
to
do
with
depletion
sustained,
and
that
was
true
to
a
considerable
extent
in
the
very
first
income
tax
statute
in
1913.
but
in
1918,
only
five
years
later,
congress
had
produced
a
new
concept,
discovery
value,
applicable
to
all
minerals.
at
this
point,
cost
ceased
to
be
relevant
and
the
aggregate
allowance
was
based
on
the
value
of
the
property
--
the
value
of
the
property,
not
the
cost,
within
30
days
after
discovery
when
you
know
what
you've
got,
not
when
you're
speculating.
in
1927,
congress
went
still
further
and
introduced
percentage
depletion
for
oil
and
gas
wells.
this
was
an
outgrowth
of
the
experience
with
discovery
value,
but
it
has
one
very
important
difference
from
discovery
depletion.
under
percentage
depletion,
the
amount
of
the
allowance
not
only
has
no
relation
to
cost,
but
it
is
also
entirely
unlimited
in
amount,
not
even
being
limited
to
the
amount
of
discovery
value.
it
goes
on
at
the
rate
of
27.5%
in
the
case
of
oil
and
gas
wells
as
long
as
oil
and
gas
are
produced,
regardless
of
the
taxpayer's
cost,
regardless
of
any
other
fixed
amount,
either
cost
or
discovery
value.
in
1932,
congress
extended
percentage
depletion
to
sulphur
and
the
metals.
in
later
years,
it
extended
percentage
depletion
to
many
other
commodities.
in
1951,
it
extended
percentage
depletion
to
clay
and
shale,
the
two
commodities
involved
here.
and
finally,
in
1954,
it
extended
percentage
depletion
to
all
minerals,
except
in
only
soil
and
sod,
and
things
taken
out
of
the
sea
in
the
area.
in
this
process,
percentage
depletion
has
become
simply
an
allowance
for
the
producers
of
minerals
having
nothing
to
do
with
their
cost.
it's
not
measured
or
limited
in
any
way
by
the
amount
invested
by
the
taxpayer
in
the
mineral
deposit
or
by
any
other
factor
relating
to
the
cost
or
value
of
the
mineral
deposit.
it
is
simply
an
allowance
for
the
producers
of
minerals,
probably
misnamed
when
it's
called
a
depletion
allowance.
it
is
more
accurately
an
incentive
allowance.
if
it
is
thought
out
as
to
depletion,
then
there
may
be
some
tendency
to
try
to
restrict
it
narrowly
so
as
to
limit
it
to
the
amount
invested
by
the
taxpayer
in
the
deposit.
but
congress
has
not
so
restricted
it.
congress
has
indeed
been
very
generous
in
the
granting
of
depletion
allowances.
congress
loves
percentage
depletion,
just
as
it
loves
farms
and
rivers
and
harbors,
and
many
other
things.
and
congress
may
well
be
right.
at
any
rate,
it's
congress'
decision.
and
if
congress
chooses
to
provide
a
generous
depletion
allowance,
there's
no
reason
why
its
judgment
should
not
be
respected
and
carried
out.
if
the
allowance
as
written
by
congress
is
indeed
--
is
indeed
too
generous,
then
the
place
where
that
should
be
rectified
is
in
congress
and
not
here.
there's
one
more
point
of
general
background.
the
taxpayer
mines
clay
and
shale
from
an
underground
mine
in
cannelton,
indiana.
it
is
superior
clay
and
shale.
the
record
shows
that
it
sold
no
clay
or
shale
except
for
a
negligible
amount
of
ground
fire
clay
and
it
also
shows
that
there
was
no
market
for
fire
clay
and
shale
in
cannelton.
the
government
expressly
concedes
that
the
taxpayer
could
not
profitably
sell
fire
clay
and
shale
in
their
raw
form.
fire
clay
and
shale
were
sold
in
brazil,
indiana,
140
miles
away,
but
all
of
this
was
produced
by
strip
miners
of
coal.
in
most
places,
the
clay
and
shale
is
a
byproduct
or
a
waste
from
the
strip
mining
operation.
it's
something
that
the
coal
miner
has
to
get
rid
of.
so,
of
course,
he's
glad
to
get
rid
of
it
cheap.
but
our
people
had
superior
shale
and
clay,
which
the
record
shows
“made
the
best
sewer
pipe
in
indiana.”
now,
with
this
background,
we
may
turn
to
the
statute
as
it
was
written
by
congress.
it
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
principal
brief
on
page
121.
in
the
first
place,
congress
generally
allowed
a
reasonable
allowance
for
depletion
according
to
the
peculiar
conditions
in
each
case.
and
then
turning
over
to
page
122,
we
find
in
the
first
paragraph
of
114
(a)
(1).
in
the
third
line
of
the
embedded
material,
we
find
shale,
5%.
and
then
in
the
third
paragraph,
we'll
find
refractory
and
fire
clay,
15%.
in
this
case,
the
taxpayer's
mineral
is
60%
fire
clay
and
40%
shale.
and
then
congress
provides
that
the
depletion
allowance
shall
be
those
percentages,
the
fourth
line
from
the
bottom
of
page
122,
of
the
gross
income
from
the
property,
not
somebody
else's
property,
not
some
idealized
property,
not
what
it
might
have
been
that
all
miners
together
had
been
averaged
out,
but
the
gross
income
from
the
property
during
the
taxable
year.
there
is,
however,
another
limitation
to
which
mr.
spritzer
has
made
no
reference
that
such
allowance
shall
not
exceed
50
per
centum
of
the
net
income
of
the
taxpayer
from
the
property.
and
when
mr.
spritzer
holds
this
$40
a
ton
sewer
pipe
up
before
you,
he's
made
no
reference
whatever
to
the
50%
limitation
which
sharply
qualifies
that.
incidentally,
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
you
can
produce
brick
for
$3
a
ton,
i'm
sure
you
can
sell
a
large
quantity.
i
understand
that
the
price
is
about
$15
a
ton
for
--
for
a
brick.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
then
we
come
to
section
114
(b).
as
used
in
this
paragraph,
the
term
gross
income
from
the
property
means
the
gross
income
from
mining.
well,
if
they'd
stop
there,
you
might
think
it
was
limited
to
mining.
but
they
won't
ride
along.
the
term
“mining”
as
used
herein
shall
be
considered
to
include
--
shall
be
considered
to
include
not
merely
the
extraction
of
the
ores
or
minerals
from
the
ground,
which
is
the
only
thing
mr.
spritzer
will
allow
us.
he
has
said
that
expressly
here
that
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
but
the
extraction
of
the
ores
and
minerals
from
the
ground,
but
congress
has
said,
“shall
be
considered
to
include
not
merely
the
extraction
but
also
the
ordinary
treatment
processes
normally
applied
by
mine
owners
or
operators
in
order
to
obtain
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
product
or
products.”
the
ordinary
treatment
processes
normally
applied
by
mine
owners
or
operators
in
order
to
obtain
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
product
or
products.
now,
the
figures
referred
by
the
government
to
this
court
show
that
90%
of
the
producers
of
fire
clay
using
more
than
73%
of
the
total
production
of
fire
clay
and
96%
of
the
producers
of
shale
using
virtually
all
of
the
shale
normally
apply
the
same
processes
as
this
taxpayer
did;
grinding,
tempering,
shaping,
firing
to
make
either
brick
or
tile
or
sewer
pipe.
and
what
90%
of
the
producers
do
to
96%
of
the
material
would
seem
to
be
what
is
normally
applied
by
mine
owners
or
operators
in
order
to
obtain
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
product.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
finding
on
that.
that
is
contained
in
--
in
a
government
document,
which
the
taxpayer
relied
on
in
the
--
in
its
brief
in
this
case,
but
has
seemed
to
sort
of
shy
from
in
its
reply
brief
and
this
is
summarized
on
page
--
it's
on
--
i
don't
think
it
was
page
83
and
84,
but
i
don't
--
mr.
travis,
can
you
find
it
and
give
me
a
reference
to
it?
and
i
will
mention
it
in
a
moment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
this
is
--
these
are
the
same
processes.
exactly
that
they
use
in
making
brick.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
--
all
the
cases
have
decided
so
far
that
everyone
who
makes
brick
may
take
depletion
based
on
the
value
of
the
brick
produced.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
seem
to
be
few
or
none
who
buy
the
raw
material
in
the
case
of
brick.
there
are
very
few
who
do
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
far
as
i
know,
there
--
i
know
of
none
who
buy
raw
materials
to
make
brick.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
this
is
on
page
72
and
73.
i'm
sorry
that
i
was
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
so
clumsy
in
finding
it.
it's
on
pages
72
through
74,
and
these
are
materials
from
the
minerals
yearbook
of
the
bureau
of
mines
on
which
is,
i
say
the
government
was
relying
in
its
main
brief
in
this
case,
but
--
which
it
shied
away
from
in
its
reply
brief.
now,
these
are
the
words
of
the
statute.
“mining
shall
be
considered
as
not
merely
the
extraction
of
the
ores
from
the
ground,
but
also
the
ordinary
treatment
processes
normally
applied
by
mine
owners
or
operators
in
order
to
obtain
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
product.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
makes
it
plain
that
congress
means
to
include
in
mining
more
than
the
extraction
of
the
mineral
from
the
ground.
the
government
has
been
greatly
troubled
by
these
words
and
has
long
sought
to
exorcize
them
from
the
statute.
it's
developed
many
theories
in
many
different
cases.
but
before
going
into
that,
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
language
which
congress
did
once
use
nearly
50
years
ago.
in
the
very
first
income
tax,
the
one
for
1913
which
is
set
out
on
page
1
of
the
government's
large
appendix,
we
find
that
there
was
a
sort
of
percentage
depletion
in
the
very
beginning.
at
that
time
though,
the
percentage
was
used
to
restrict
the
amount
of
the
deduction
below
cost,
not
to
expand
it
above
cost
as
in
the
present
statute.
but
what
congress
said
in
1913
was
that
depletion
should
not
exceed
5
per
centum
of
the
gross
value
at
the
mine.
now,
let's
look
at
that
phrase,
“gross
value
at
the
mine.”
this
is
essentially
what
the
government
argues
for
in
this
case.
yet,
it
is
obvious
that
the
statutory
provision
here
is
very
different.
what
the
government's
position
amounts
to
either,
is
either
an
elimination
of
the
words,
which
congress
has
written
specifically
with
respect
to
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
product
or
products
or
at
the
very
least,
a
substitution
for
these
words
of
other
words
which
have
a
much
more
restrictive
meaning.
in
various
cases
at
various
times,
the
government
has
come
up
with
different
formulae
which
it
liked
to
have
read
into
the
statute.
in
some
of
the
earlier
cases,
it
sought
to
draw
a
distinction
between
manufacturing
and
mining,
and
it
has
finally
in
its
reply
brief
in
this
case
come
back
to
launch
that
same
argument.
this
was
done
in
the
cherokee
brick
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
in
the
merry
brothers
case
where
this
court
denied
the
petition
for
certiorari.
then
in
the
dragon
cement
case
in
the
first
circuit,
the
government
sought
to
lay
stress
on
the
words
“mineral
product”
and
sought
to
confine
them
to
the
product
as
it
comes
out
of
the
mine
or
very
shortly
thereafter.
that
argument
was
rejected
in
an
opinion
by
judge
magruder
for
the
first
circuit
and
since
this
gives
a
careful
discussion
of
the
problem
and
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
we
have
printed
it
in
full
in
appendix
2
to
our
brief
which
is
the
--
the
white
supplement,
somewhat
smaller
than
the
government's
but
the
total
volume
of
words
in
this
case
is
already
considerable.
then
in
the
richland
shale
case
and
in
the
court
below
in
this
case,
note
i
said
the
court
below,
the
government's
argument
was
based
on
the
concept
of
least
processed.
of
course
there's
nothing
like
this
in
the
statute
as
congress
has
written
it.
congress
didn't
say
least
processed.
it
said
commercially
marketable
mineral
product
or
products.congress
might
have
said
many
other
things,
but
it's
what
congress
did
say
that
ought
to
be
controlling.
when
the
treasury
went
to
congress
last
year
to
try
to
get
the
law
changed,
it
developed
still
a
different
phrase.
and
this
appears
at
page
131
of
our
appendix
2
where
there
is
set
forth
the
text
of
the
statute,
which
the
treasury
submitted
to
congress
last
year
to
deal
with
this
problem.
and
the
idea
is
there
expressed
as
“capable
of
being
transported,”
as
distinguished
from
those
processes
“which
make
the
mineral
or
ore
saleable.”
this
would
be
getting
completely
away
from
the
words,
commercially
marketable.
commercially
marketable
surely
means
saleable
and
no
formula
can
be
a
sound
construction
of
this
statute
which
does
not
give
effect
to
that
construction
and
yet
i
suggest
that
what
the
government
is
arguing
here
is
in
essence
what
they
sought
to
get,
unsuccessfully
sought
to
get
congress
to
put
into
the
statute.
finally
in
its
main
brief
in
this
case,
in
this
court
for
the
first
time,
the
government
came
up
with
still
another
formulation
and
its
effort
to
escape
from
the
effect
of
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
product
or
products,
words.
in
its
main
brief
in
this
court,
the
government
repeatedly
based
its
argument
on
a
new
phrase
“fit
for
commercial
or
industrial
use”.
that
is
no
doubt
an
interesting
conception,
but
it
is
not
the
test
enacted
by
congress
and
there's
no
reason
why
the
words
of
congress
did
use
should
not
be
given
the
statute's.
apparently,
the
government
now
agrees,
for
in
its
reply
brief,
it
has
abandoned
that
phrase
entirely
and
now
comes
up
with
still
another
set
of
phrases,
all
of
course,
in
an
effort
to
get
away
from
the
words
which
congress
used.
now,
there's
another
part
of
the
government's
case
as
to
which
i'm
a
little
baffled.
at
page
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but,
mr.
justice,
if
it
could
--
if
it
could
be
in
general,
i'd
like
to
think
about
it.
actually,
the
--
the
indication
here
is,
it's
more
or
less
pure
chance
that
the
one
place
where
there
are
substantial
sales
of
fire
clay
and
shale
is
brazil,
indiana.
there
is
indeed
more
there
than
can
be
sold
as
the
record
shows,
which
of
course,
accounts
for
it's
--
it's
low
price.
suppose
those
sales
had
been
in
hawaii
or
in
maine
or
in
california
or
in
texas,
would
they
be
regarded
as
relevant
with
respect
to
this
taxpayer?
now
it's
true
this
taxpayer
is
much
closer,
but
economically,
it
is
just
as
far
away
as
if
the
sales
were
in
maine
or
california.
if
this
taxpayer's
costs
are
$2.41
a
ton
to
get
its
superior
clay
out
of
an
underground
mine,
its
cost
to
transportation
from
cannelton
to
brazil,
the
record
shows,
varies
from
$5
to
$6
a
ton.
and
the
price
for
strip
mining
waste
in
--
in
brazil
is
a
$1
to
$1.5
a
ton.
now,
brazil
might
just
as
well
be
in
maine
or
in
california
as
far
as
this
taxpayer
is
concerned.
it
is
an
irrelevant
market
with
respect
to
this
taxpayer,
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
unchallenged
is,
that
there
was
no
market
for
the
taxpayer's
fire
clay
and
shale.
there
is
no
--
there
was
never
any
issue
in
the
district
court
with
respect
to
salability
generally
throughout
the
united
states
of
fire
clay
and
shale,
and
the
record
is
very
sparse
on
that.
the
government
finally
in
this
court
for
the
first
time
referred
to
this
bureau
of
mines
pamphlet
that
i
have
mentioned,
but
which
is
not
in
the
record
and
was
never
called
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court.
the
sole
contest
in
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
with
respect
to
whether
the
taxpayer
could
sell
its
fire
clay
and
shale.
and
incidentally,
there
is
much
reason
to
--
to
think
that
the
whole
case
is
a
kind
of
a
mistake.
in
the
opening
of
the
taxpayer's
counsel
in
the
district
court,
page
17
of
the
record,
and
i'd
like
to
have
the
court
look
at
this.
right
at
the
middle
of
the
page,
mr.
(inaudible),
counsel
for
the
government
in
the
district
court
said,
“the
economics
of
the
situation
will
also
be
a
matter
of
proof,
and
the
government
will
offer
evidence
to
show
the
average
cost
including
a
profit
of
transporting
clay
is
1.80
cents
per
ton-mile.
and
this
was
in
an
effort
to
show
that
the
taxpayer
couldn't
get
its
clay
to
brazil
and
sell
it.
and
then
they
produced
their
witness,
mr.
smith,
and
his
testimony
appears
on
page
--
begins
on
page
84
of
the
record.
and
if
you
will
look
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page,
you
will
find
that
mr.
smith
testified
that
it
cost
1.80
cents
a
ton-mile
to
haul
the
clay.
and
that's
the
bottom
of
page
84.and
then
mr.
smith
was
cross-examined
and
he
clung
to
the
1.80
cents
a
ton-mile.
he
weakened
a
little,
but
he
never
would
give
up
even
when
it
was
pointed
out.
and
then
the
next
day,
page
161
of
the
record,
mr.
smith
came
back
to
court
and
mr.
(inaudible),
counsel
for
the
government
stood
up
in
court
interrupting
another
witness.
“your
honor,
may
i
interrupt.
mr.
smith
who
testified
yesterday
--
this
is
page
161
near
the
bottom
of
the
page
--
has
examined
the
computations
which
he
made
and
states
to
me
that
he
made
a
misplacement
of
the
decimal
point,
and
it
should
be
18
cents
per
ton-mile
rather
than
one
and
eight
tenths
on
the
short-haul
distances.
the
court,
“now,
do
you
want
to
call
him
as
witness?”
mr.
travis,
for
the
plaintiff,
“we
will
stipulate
the
18
cents
is
correct,
the
correct
figure.”
mr.
(inaudible),
for
the
defendant.
mr.
smith
came
back
to
make
the
record
clear.
and
thus,
the
government's
proof
with
respect
to
the
possibility
of
getting
the
taxpayer's
clay
to
brazil
evaporated.
now,
i
come
to
this
point
which
baffles
me.
until
this
afternoon,
the
government
has
expressly
conceded
that
the
clay
and
shale
involved
here
were
not
covered
by
those
four
roman
numbered
paragraphs
to
which
mr.
spritzer
referred
in
his
argument.
i'd
like
to
call
attention
to
the
government's
brief,
the
top
of
page
21.
the
minerals
involved
in
this
case,
fire
clay
and
shale
are
not
specifically
designated.
now,
on
the
basis
of
that
concession,
mr.
spritzer
said
the
opposite
this
afternoon
but
in
his
brief
he
says
they
are
not
specifically
designated.
on
that
concession,
this
is
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
an
agreement
that
shale
and
clay
are
not
customarily
sold
in
the
form
of
a
crude
mineral
product,
and
i
can
only
surmise
that
the
government
has
seen
the
consequences
of
its
concession
that
shale
and
clay
are
not
covered
by
the
statute
by
the
specifically
numbered
places.
they
have
never
before
in
any
court,
in
this
case,
made
a
suggestion
that
those
four
numbered
paragraphs
specifically
applied
to
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
said
specifically
that
these
minerals
--
these
minerals
are
covered
by
(3)
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
because
he
said
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
because
he
said
that
they
are
customarily
sold
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
in
the
form
of
a
crude
mineral
product.
i
interpret
the
brief
to
say
that
they
are
not
covered,
which
must
rest
on
--
on
my
understanding
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
with
this
background,
we
can
come
to
the
first
point
which
it
presented
in
their
respondent's
brief.
it's
our
contention
that
the
arguments
which
the
government
is
now
making
in
this
court
are
not
available
to
it
on
this
record.
and
should
not
be
considered
or
decided
by
this
court
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
on
this
record,
in
terms
of
the
issues
actually
presented
by
the
government
in
the
district
court
through
the
things
that
are
irrelevant
with
respect
to
a
trial
on
a
district
court,
the
pretrial
order,
the
opening
statement
of
counsel,
the
trial
and
the
briefs
of
counsel
in
that
court
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
correct.
this
court
and
the
court
below
have
appellate
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
not
original
jurisdiction.
and
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
a
reversal
of
the
district
court's
decision
unless
that
court
made
an
error
on
an
issue
which
was
presented
to
it
by
the
government
and
unless
the
record
contains
the
material
which
supports
the
government's
present
position.
the
government
has
had
its
day
in
court.
it's
not
entitled
to
a
new
trial
even
though
the
district
court
may
be
wrong
in
an
abstract
sense,
unless
the
district
court's
decision
is
erroneous
on
an
issue,
which
was
presented
to
it
by
the
government
at
the
trial.
never
in
the
district
court
did
the
government
make
any
argument
about
least
processed,
which
was
the
basis
for
its
argument
in
the
court
below.
never
in
the
district
court
did
the
government
make
any
argument
about
fit
for
commercial
or
industrial
use,
which
was
the
basis
of
its
argument
here
when
its
main
brief
was
filed.
on
the
contrary,
the
only
point
raised
in
the
district
court
was
whether
there
was
a
market
for
this
taxpayer's
clay
and
shale.
it
was
overwhelmingly
proved
that
there
was
no
such
market.
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
a
reversal
of
that
decision
except
on
a
ground,
which
was
presented
to
the
district
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
pretrial
order
in
this
case
because
i
think
in
part,
that
is
true.
the
function
of
a
pretrial
is
to
narrow
the
issues.
and
as
a
result
of
the
pretrial
order
in
this
case,
of
which
appears
on
--
begins
on
page
263,
continues
to
page
265
and
was
approved
by
counsel
for
both
parties.
paragraph
2
on
page
264,
counsel
for
the
defendant
represented
to
the
court
that
the
defendant
through
its
internal
revenue
service
had
initiated
as
of
this
date
a
survey
regarding
the
sales
of
shale
and
clay,
fire
clay,
in
a
certain
marketing
area
which
it'd
--
would
include
the
location
of
the
plaintiff's
mine
and
factory
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
defendant
will
claim
in
this
cause
of
action
that
plaintiff
has
a
market
for
the
clay
which
it
mines,
no
talk
about
whether
there
is
a
market
in
general
for
clay
somewhere
in
the
country.
whether
the
plaintiff
has
the
market
for
the
clay
which
it
mines
prior
to
be
being
put
in
the
form
of
finished
vitrified
sewer
pipe
and
other
related
products
which
are
made
and
sold
--
sold
by
the
plaintiff,
and
further
that,
if
the
defendant
determined
that
there
was
such
a
market,
then
an
additional
survey
would
be
made
to
determine
the
market
value
of
the
clay
mined
by
plaintiff
at
the
point
where
the
defendant
claims
that
there
was
a
market
for
the
clay.
counsel
for
the
defendant
further
represented
that
if
it
were
determined
as
a
result
of
the
survey
that
there
was
no
market
for
the
clay
and
shale
of
the
type
mined
or
used
by
the
plaintiff,
prior
to
as
being
put
in
finished
form
ready
for
sale,
then
plaintiff's
claim
as
alleged
in
plaintiff's
complaint
would
be
recommended
for
administrative
refund
by
the
internal
revenue
service
of
defendant.
and
then
turn
to
paragraph
4
of
the
pretrial
order.
if
this
cause
of
action
is
to
be
tried
by
the
court,
it
was
agreed
between
the
parties
that
the
only
issues
of
fact
which
would
have
to
be
presented
to
the
court
would
be
first,
whether
the
plaintiff
has
any
commercially
marketable
product
or
products
from
the
shale
and
clay,
which
it
mines
prior
to
the
finished
vitrified
sewer
pipe
and
other
products
which
plaintiff
produces
and
sells
and
it's
overwhelmingly
clear
that
the
plaintiff
cannot
sell
anything
prior
to
that.
and
second,
what
is
the
value
of
such
commercially
marketable
product
or
products
if
it
is
determined
that
plaintiff
has
such
a
product
or
products
prior
to
the
completed
vitrified
sewer
pipe
and
other
products
which
plaintiff
makes
and
sells.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
--
it
can
be
so
read,
i
believe.
i
do
not
believe
it
was
so
understood
by
counsel
or
by
the
district
court
as
it
evidenced
by
the
briefs
which
were
filed
in
the
district
court,
the
issues
which
the
district
court
conceived
to
be
--
conceived
to
be
before
it
and
its
findings
and
determination
on
that
issue.
the
whole
focus
of
this
case
was
as
to
whether
this
taxpayer
held
something
which
it
can
sell
prior
to
the
vitrified
sewer
pipe.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
first
place,
mr.
justice,
the
phrase
and
the
statute
is
commercially
marketable.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
where
does
the
phrase
products
for
which
there
is
in
the
--
in
the
pretrial
order.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
find
it
hard
to
--
i
--
i
would
hesitate
without
thinking
more
to
say
that
i
think
the
two
are
identical.
i
would
find
it
hard
to
see
how
there
could
be
a
commercially
marketable
mineral
product
unless
it
was
a
product
for
which
there
was
a
market.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
can
be
argued
that
the
article
is
not
marketable
in
a
place
where
there
is
no
market
if
the
place
where
there
is
a
market
is
so
far
away
that
the
cost
of
getting
there,
make
it
prohibitive
to
get
your
product
to
that
market.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
necessarily
to
the
particular
owner,
but
marketable
generally
at
a
profit.
yes.
i
think
i
recognize
what
mr.
spritzer
said
that
the
market
sometimes
involves
losses
for
some
people,
but
if
the
--
if
the
product
is
--
is
one
which
ordinarily
cannot
be
sold
with
a
reasonable
prospects
in
pursuit
of
success
of
a
profit,
then
it
is
not
commercially
marketable,
and
i
believe
that
that
is
true
of
fire
clay
and
shale.
it
is
not
true
in
--
it
is
not
true
in
brazil
where
it's
sold
as
a
byproduct
of
--
and
a
waste
from
strip
mining
of
coal,
but
i
believe
it
is
generally
true
of
fire
clay
and
shale
in
the
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
was
not
--
not
commercially
marketable.
obviously,
there's
--
is
a
market
all
over
the
united
states
for
oil
at
all
times.
i
don't
think
that's
true
for
fire
clay
and
shale
or
brick
and
tile
clay
or
of
cement
rock
or
of
a
good
many
other
things
that
are
involved
in
this
controversy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
when
i
took
elementary
economics,
i
--
i
learned
things
about
time
utility
and
place
utility
among
other
things.
and
a
ton
of
clay
in
cannelton
is
something
out
of
which
the
cannelton
sewer
pipe
company
can
make
the
best
sewer
pipe
made
in
indiana
and
sell
and
keep
in
business.
a
ton
of
clay
in
brazil
is
something
which
they
cannot
utilize
or
to
put
in
other
way
around,
a
ton
of
clay
in
cannelton
is
something
which
they
cannot
effectively
market,
cannot
commercially
market
in
brazil
because
they
simply
can't
afford
to
get
it
there.
i
do
think
that
place
utility
is
an
important
factor
here.
i
think
our
case
is
made
a
little
harder
because
it's
brazil,
indiana.
i
think
that
if
the
place
where
it
was
widely
sold
was
montara,
california
that
one
wouldn't
have
any
difficulty
in
seeing
that
the
fact
that
it
is
salable
there
simply
isn't
relevant
to
this
taxpayer.
and
i
submit
that
economically,
it's
exactly
the
same.
this
taxpayer
was
just
as
far
out
of
the
brazil,
indiana
market
as
if
it
had
been
any
place
else.
indeed,
this
particular
taxpayer
has
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
in
texas.
i
don't
suppose
anyone
would
think
that
the
fact
that
--
but
that
shale
and
clay
are
sold
in
brazil,
indiana
is
there
any
particular
relevance
with
respect
to
the
depletion
of
these
subsidiaries,
tile,
or
even
shale
and
clay
in
texas.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
if
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
court
--
depletion
would
be
presumably
based
on
cost,
not
on
what
you
could
sell
it
for.
but,
actually,
since
this
stuff
can't
be
sold
very
much
on
the
spot
until
you
do
something
with
it,
the
cost
of
it
isn't
very
much.
its
discovery
value
isn't
very
much.
and
it's
quite
plain
that
if
this
taxpayer's
depletion
allowance
is
to
be
restricted
to
its
cost
or
to
its
value,
that
it
has
no
case.
it
seems
to
us
equally
plain
that
congress
rightly
or
wrongly
but
in
its
wisdom
has
specifically
granted
a
substantial
depletion
allowance
to
the
miners
of
clay
and
shale.
i
quite
agree
that
if
--
if
we're
restricted
to
cost,
then
an
awful
lot
of
work
that
congress
has
done
over
a
period
of
a
good
many
years
has
been
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that's
clear.
we're
depleted
of
clay
and
if
we're
restricted
--
if
we're
restricted
to
cost
or
the
value
of
the
clay,
we
get
a
very
small
allowance.
this
may
be
the
case
which
demonstrates
the
truth
of
the
old
quip
that
when
the
legislative
history
is
ambiguous,
we
should
look
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
where
there
are
large
amounts
of
legislative
history.
both
parties
who
worked
hard
to
put
it
before
the
court,
the
government's
appendix
has
466
pages
running
from
1913
to
1954
and
we're
all
much
indebted
to
them
for
putting
that
together.
i
--
my
only
objection
to
it
is
the
way
they
used
italics,
and
i
hope
the
court
will
read
all
that's
there,
not
just
what
they
have
italicized.
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
in
order
to
complete
the
picture,
we've
added
57
pages
more
running
from
1930
to
1959.
we've
also
filed
with
the
court
copies
of
the
hearings
held
on
this
subject
by
the
ways
and
means
committee
in
1959
when
the
treasury
presented
to
congress
essentially
the
same
arguments
which
the
government
counsel
is
presenting
here
today.
indeed,
the
table
attached
to
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
showing
in
greatly
exaggerated
form,
i
believe,
the
amount
the
government
says
is
involved
in
this
general
problem
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
table
which
the
treasury
represented
to
congress.
it's
too
bad
to
have
to
look
at
all
these
legislative
history,
when
as
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
is
reasonably
clear,
that
words
of
the
statute
are
allowed
to
have
their
natural
meaning
and
effect.
but
if
one
does
look
to
the
legislative
history,
it's
our
view
that
it
supports
the
conclusion
for
which
we
contend.
before
percentage
depletion
was
extended
to
metals
and
to
sulphur
in
1932,
there
were
extensive
investigations
and
reports,
reports
which
lie
at
the
very
foundation
of
the
legislative
history,
the
parker
report
and
the
shepherd
report
included
in
large
part
in
the
government's
appendix.
these
reports
pointed
out
to
congress
the
difficulties
arising
out
of
discovery
value.
essentially,
the
problem
evaluation,
no
two
experts
could
agree
on
the
discovery
value
of
any
mine.
no
taxpayer
could
make
out
his
tax
return
and
no
taxpayer
could
ascertain
his
tax
liability
without
litigation.
the
crying
need
was
for
certain
and
this,
i
believe,
is
the
key
to
all
that
congress
has
done
in
this
area.
congress
has
tried
to
provide
a
method
for
determining
depletion
which
would
be
automatic,
which
the
taxpayer
could
follow
and
apply
himself
and
which
he
could
use
in
making
out
his
own
tax
return.
our
whole
system
of
income
taxation
depends
upon
self-assessment
and
the
key
to
percentage
depletion,
i
think,
is
that
congress
has
at
all
times
undertaken
to
set
up
a
system
which
would
be
susceptible
to
self-assessment
and
is
constantly
amended
and
modified
the
statute
to
offset
efforts
by
the
treasury
to
cut
down
percentage
depletion
in
ways
which
would
make
self-assessment
difficult
or
impossible.
in
the
tax
magazine
a
year
ago,
there
was
a
cartoon
which
illustrates
the
point
i
have
in
mind.
the
picture
showed
a
meeting
of
the
ways
and
means
committee
in
the
session
and
a
congressman
standing
who
says,
"before
i
vote,
i
want
to
call
my
taxman
and
find
out
if
he
could
prepare
my
tax
return
under
this
proposed
amendment.”
in
the
present
case,
the
taxpayer
can
readily
prepare
his
tax
return
if
the
taxpayer's
position
is
sustained.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
government
prevails,
there
will
be
no
ascertainable
figure
which
the
taxpayer
can
use
to
determine
the
amount
of
his
depletion
deduction.
that
will
depend
on
a
theoretical
or
hypothetical
figure
representing
no
operation
of
the
taxpayer,
not
appearing
on
the
taxpayer's
books,
not
ascertainable
by
the
taxpayer
by
any
means
to
which
the
government
has
yet
pointed
in
this
case.
prior
to
1932,
congress
was
told
several
ways
in
which
percentage
depletion
might
be
ascertained.
one
was
the
fixed
rate
per
unit
method,
so
much
per
pound
or
per
ton.
and
you
could
apply
that
here
and
you
could
tell
the
answers.
congress
didn't
adopt
this
for
the
very
reason
that
it
would
not
recognize
differences
among
taxpayers
and
the
value
of
various
grades
of
ores.
congress
was
told
that
percentage
depletion
could
be
based
on
gross
income
or
on
net
income
and
congress
in
fact
adopted
both
of
these
measures.
basically,
percentage
depletion
is
based
on
gross
income
from
the
property.
but
it
is
limited
to
50%
of
the
net
income
of
the
property.
but
the
important
thing
to
note
is
that
in
each
case,
the
percentage
is
applied
to
an
ascertainable
figure
derived
from
the
taxpayer's
own
operations
and
experience,
not
by
going
out
and
surveying
the
country
as
a
whole.
the
treasury
soon
put
out
some
rather
restrictive
regulations
but
interestingly
enough,
we
now
know
that
from
the
beginning,
the
treasury
agreed
that
it
would
not
apply
these
regulations
and
this
is
an
--
an
interesting
event
which
is
set
out
on
page
85
of
our
brief.
mr.
parker,
as
chief
of
staff
of
the
joint
committee
on
internal
revenue
taxation
had
been
responsible.
mr.
l.h.
parker,
a
well-known
figure
here
in
washington,
for
the
preparation
of
the
parker
report
upon
which
percentage
depletion
was
based
in
1932.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
on
page
85
of
my
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
brief.
in
1947,
mr.
parker,
no
longer
with
the
government,
appearing
before
the
ways
and
means
committee,
recounted
what
happened
in
1932.
the
mine
operators
protested
the
definitions
grafted
by
the
commissioner
and
then
skipped
a
couple
of
sentences.
in
this
conference,
it
was
agreed
the
definitions
grafted
by
the
commissioner
did
not
express
the
intent
of
congress.
but
then
they
found
the
awkward
situation
that
the
regulations
were
all
printed,
march
15th
was
coming.
if
they
were
going
to
change
it,
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
the
regulations
out
into
the
hands
of
taxpayers
and
there
would
be
chaos
for
everybody
else.
and
so
below
the
middle
of
page
85,
to
meet
this
situation,
it
was
proposed
that
the
regulations
be
issued
as
printed
with
the
understanding
the
definitions
would
be
interpreted
and
applied
according
to
the
meaning
of
the
act
as
agreed
to
in
that
conference.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
italics
apply
--
my
italics
apply,
not
the
--
not
the
government's.[laughter]
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
now
actually,
for
the
next
eight
years,
1932
to
1940,
the
treasury
allowed
all
the
treatment
processes
which
were
customarily
used
to
obtain
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
product.
those
words
weren't
in
the
statute,
but
they
did
represent
both
the
intention
of
congress
and
the
practice
of
the
treasury
department.
but
beginning
in
1940s,
the
treasury
began
to
squeeze
down.
it's
--
that's
understandable
enough.
i
--
i
know
their
point
of
view,
but
the
treasury
doesn't
like
percentage
depletion,
congress
does.
if
treasury
tries
to
cut
it
down,
congress
puts
it
back.
in
1942,
the
treasury
promised
to
mend
its
ways,
restore
the
old
practice,
but
it
didn't
do
so
and
in
1943,
congress
stepped
in
and
enacted
the
statutory
provision
which
is
involved
here,
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
products
rule.
commercially
marketable,
it
seems
to
me
must
mean
salable
in
congress,
and
what
is
more,
it
gives
a
definite
ascertainable
figure
to
which
the
percentage
can
be
automatically
applied,
ascertainable
in
most
cases
directly
from
the
taxpayer's
books
and
capable
of
being
applied
as
a
matter
of
course
without
uncertainty,
delay
or
controversy.
this
was
no
inadvertent
amendment.
the
senate
finance
committee
specifically
said
that
it
was
intended
to
mean
what
it
said.
that
is,
now,
the
treasury
didn't
like
it.
and
this
particular
provision,
extending
percentage
depletion
was
one
of
the
provisions
in
the
statute
to
which
president
roosevelt
specifically
referred
when
he
vetoed
the
revenue
bill
of
1943.
but
congress
did
like
it
and
passed
the
bill
on
to
law
despite
the
president's
objections.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
that
is
on
page
89
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
the
purpose
of
the
provision
is
to
make
certain
that
the
ordinary
treatment
processes
which
any
mine
operator
would
normally
apply
to
obtain
any
marketable
product
should
be
considered
as
a
part
of
the
mining
operation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice.
since
1943,
congress
has
continued
to
extend
percentage
depletion
to
additional
minerals
always
following
the
commercially
marketable
products
rule.
for
example,
when
the
treasury
sought
to
eliminate
transportation
from
the
mine
to
mill,
the
treasury
says,
“well,
transportation
isn't
mining.”
it's
transportation,
and
they'd
cut
it
out.
congress
specifically
provided
that
transportation
should
be
included
in
order
to
maintain
the
commercially
marketable
products
rule.
in
1951,
congress
extended
percentage
depletion
to
fire
clay
and
shale
along
with
many
other
products.
again,
the
legislative
history
along
with
the
statutory
language
shows
that
the
commercially
marketable
product
rule
was
intended,
something
readily
ascertainable
and
capable
of
self-assessment
by
the
taxpayer.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
government's
position
here
amount
as
mr.
spritzer
conceded
in
saying
that
in
the
case
of
fire
clay
and
shale
as
mined
by
this
taxpayer,
there
are
no
ordinary
treatment
processes.
thus,
rendering
nugatory
a
clear
and
carefully
worked
out
provision
of
the
statute
which
congress
has
maintained
now
for
17
years
and
which
because
it
was
made
retroactive
in
1932,
when
it
was
is
first
enacted,
has
been
applicable
to
percentage
depletion
for
28
years.
what
is
the
basis
for
writing
these
words
out
of
the
statute,
which
is
the
general
effect
of
the
government's
position?
congress
can,
of
course,
do
that
if
it
chooses,
but
has
shown
no
signs
of
wanting
to
do
so.
it
should
also
be
pointed
out
that
the
government's
position
here
would
mean
that
no
underground
miner
of
shale
or
fire
clay,
no
underground
miner
of
shale
or
fire
clay,
any
place
in
the
country,
would
ever
get
any
percentage
depletion
at
all.
this
is
because
of
the
limitation
of
the
allowance
to
50%
of
the
net
income
from
mines.
if
the
underground
miner's
operations
often
is
here
yielding
a
superior
grade
of
clay
and
shale
are
to
be
limited
by
sales,
far
away
in
an
unattainable
market,
made
by
strip
miners
of
coal
who
obtain
clay
and
shale
as
a
waste
or
byproduct,
then
the
underground
miner
will
have
no
net
income
from
his
property
and
thus,
no
percentage
depletion.
it
seems
obvious
that
this
was
not
the
result
intended
by
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
congress
may
--
will
have
intended
that
mr.
justice.
i
feel
there
is
the
large
element
of
incentive
here.
congress
--
they
didn't
test
this
congress
to
--
for
a
hundred
years,
congress
has
done
things
for
miners
in
great
and
generous
ways.
and
i
think
that
here,
it
is
plainly
intended
as
an
incentive
for
miners.
this
leads
to
the
next
point
i
wanted
to
make,
which
is
that
percentage
depletion
is
determined
not
only
by
the
base,
but
also
by
the
rate.
in
the
case
of
clay,
the
rate
is
--
in
the
case
of
--
of
shale,
the
rate
is
lower,
5%
as
compared
with
27.5%
for
oil
and
gas
and
23%
for
sulphur
and
15%
for
metals.
it's
also
15%
for
fire
clay
but
that's
a
fairly
rare
commodity.
if
the
result
of
this
based
on
rate
is
too
much
then
the
easy
way
to
change
that
is
to
change
the
rate.
but
the
rate
is
surely
a
matter
for
the
judgment
of
congress.
of
course,
this
court
would
not
say
that
when
congress
said
the
depletion
allowance
should
be
15%
or
5%,
it
really
meant
that
this
rate
should
be
8%
and
3%,
no
more
should
the
court
fail
to
give
effect
to
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
product
or
products
test
which
congress
has
persistently
and
consistently
maintained
in
this
important
area
of
which
it
has
been
fully
and
constantly
aware.
incidentally,
nobody
knows
where
these
percentages
came
from.
there
was
apparently
some
slight
basis
for
the
original
27.5%
for
oil
and
gas
though
the
exact
figure
was
a
compromised
--
committee-compromised
between
25%
recommended
by
the
senate
finance
committee
and
30%
adopted
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
the
conference
committee
split
the
difference
and
made
it
27.5%
and
we've
had
that
now
for
34
years.
the
15%
for
metal
mines
introduced
in
1932
was
apparently
based
on
a
survey
showing
that
discovery
value
depletion
had
averaged
about
17%
of
gross
sales,
now
note
that,
the
--
the
parker
and
shepherd
report
to
which
the
government
refers,
based
the
15%
on
the
fact
that
discovery
value
taking
the
taxpayer's
return,
they
found
their
sales,
whatever
they
sold,
whether
it
was
concentrate
or
refined
metal,
they
found
that
that
came
out
to
about
17%.
so
they
said,
“well,
let's
make
it
15%
of
gross
sales.”
but
beyond
this,
there's
no
basis
for
the
percentages
beyond
legislative
judgment
or
choice.
fire
clay
is
15%,
perhaps
because
it's
probably
scarce.
shale
is
5%,
not
inconceivably
because
congress
recognized
that
it
is
applied
to
a
fairly
large
base
under
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
product
or
products
rule
which
congress
has
long
maintained
in
the
statute.
coal
is
5%
to
begin
with,
but
in
1951,
congress
raised
it
to
10%.
the
whole
matter
is
neither
precise
nor
scientific.
it
should
not
be
approached,
i
think,
in
a
niggardly
or
parsimonious
way.
congress
may
well
know
just
what
it
is
doing
in
this
area
as
the
legislative
history,
i
think,
shows.
the
president
of
the
american
institute
of
certified
public
accountants
in
a
recent
address
said,
“what
are
called
loopholes
are
often
congress'
way
of
apologizing
for
the
high
tax
rates.
these
are
special
provisions
to
afford
some
taxpayer's
relief.
for
example,
the
average
taxpayer
gets
sick
pay
tax-free.
married
people
are
taxed
more
lightly
to
split
income.
the
executives
get
to
break
through
stock
options
and
investors
have
the
cushion
of
capital
gains.
and
in
fact,
congress
sets
higher
rates
and
then
tears
them
down
--
tears
down
some
of
the
rate
structure
by
allowing
special
benefits
for
some
taxpayers.”
that's
the
end
of
the
quotation.
the
economic
effects
from
such
an
allowance
as
percentage
depletion
are
far
from
clear.
it's
perhaps
easy
to
assume
that
what
is
involved
here
is
some
sort
of
bonanza
for
taxpayers.
but
an
actual
operation,
percentage
depletion
may
mean
such
things
as
lower
prices
for
consumers,
more
employment
and
higher
wages
for
the
workers.
it
may
mean
that
this
business
is
kept
operating
and
paying
taxes
or
that
the
use
for
national
resources
effectively
utilized.
all
of
these
things
may
be
the
consequences
of
percentage
depletion
and
congress
may
well
have
had
such
consequences
in
mind
in
extending
percentage
depletion
to
mineral
resources
as
widely
as
it
does.
the
treasury's
argument
goes
far
to
read
percentage
depletion
out
of
the
statute.
this
is
shown
when
the
government
says
in
its
reply
brief
that
cost
depletion
is
available,
what
cost
depletion
to
the
mill
here.
but
congress
granted
percentage
depletion
to
fire
clay
and
shale,
and
it
is
hardly
consistent
with
the
legislative
purpose
to
adopt
the
construction
of
its
word
which
would
eliminate
percentage
depletion
for
a
large
segment
of
the
clay
and
shale
industry.
besides,
this
eliminates
the
whole
discovery
value
concept
which
for
more
than
40
years
has
been
the
background
of
percentage
depletion.
the
approach
of
congress
is
illustrated
by
the
events
of
the
past
seven
years.
three
times,
beginning
in
1954,
the
treasury
has
tried
to
get
congress
to
change
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
product
or
products
rule
and
congress
has
never
done
so.
in
1954,
the
treasury
sought
to
get
congress
to
eliminate
molding,
shaping,
extruding,
firing
or
burning
in
the
case
of
the
brick
and
tile
clay.
well,
obviously,
those
are
the
same
processes
that
are
involved
here.
at
first,
the
ways
and
means
committee
announced
that
it
was
going
to
make
this
change,
but
six
days
later,
on
february
24,
1954
did
announce
that
it
had
reconsidered
leaving
the
question
as
it
was
under
existing
law.
the
new
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
was
enacted
in
the
same
language
as
the
1939
code.
congress
has
never
made
this
change.
in
1958,
they
brought
our
figures
on.
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
formally
asked
congress
to
abolish
the
commercially
marketable
products
rule
as
to
clay
and
as
to
minerals
used
in
making
cement.
later,
the
treasury
submitted
a
specific
legislation
showing
in
its
submission,
however,
that
it
understood
that
law
to
be
in
accordance
with
our
position
here.
once
again,
congress
took
no
action,
no
hearings
were
held,
no
bill
was
introduced.
finally,
in
1959,
the
president
included
this
question
in
his
budget
message.
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
wrote
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
to
the
vice-president,
recommending
the
elimination
of
“raise
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
product
or
products
from
the
statute”
and
the
substitution
of
a
new
definition
of
mining.
a
few
days
later,
a
specific
legislative
proposal
was
submitted.
the
ways
and
means
committee
held
five
days
of
hearings
on
this
proposal
and
this
is
the
volume
of
those
hearings
which
we
have
filed
with
the
court.
once
again,
the
treasury
made
no
progress
with
the
ways
and
means
committee.
the
committee
has
not
reported
the
bill
and
congress
has
taken
no
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
long
as
the
taxpayer
is
using
the
ordinary
treatment
processes
which
are
normally
applied
by
mine
owners
or
operators
with
respect
to
the
particular
mineral
that
he
is
using,
then
i
would
say
that
it
is
the
product
made
by
this
taxpayer.
if
he
used
the
different
processes,
if
he
makes
something
above
and
beyond
the
ordinary
treatment
processes,
then
of
course,
you
can't
include
that.
now,
this
is
illustrated
by
several
cases
and
i'm
not
going
to
have
time
enough
to
deal
with
that
are
in
our
brief,
for
example,
the
iowa
limestone
case
is
a
case
involving
chemical
grade
limestone,
which
is
pretty
good
stuff.
it
sells
for
a
pretty
good
price.
the
commissioner
says
in
that
court
that
the
basic
mineral
product
with
respect
to
limestone
is
crushed
stone
that's
used
for
roads.
and
you
can
get
depletion
on
road
stone
with
respect
to
this.
the
taxpayer
in
that
case
doesn't
make
road
stone.
it
isn't
sensible
to
use.
it's
high
grade
stuff
to
make
road
stone.
it
grinds
it,
sells
it
for
chemical
grade
limestone
at
several
times
the
price
that
road
stone
sells
for,
and
the
eighth
circuit
has
held
it's
entitled
to
take
its
depletion
on
chemical
grade
limestone.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
thompson
against
the
hitchcock
company
which
involves
talc,
some
of
the
talc
is
taken
out
and
cut
into
crayons
which
sell
at
a
high
price.
some
of
the
rest
of
the
talc
which
isn't
quite
as
good
is
ground
and
is
used
to
make
face
powder
and
a
lot
of
other
things
that
are
sold
at
a
much
lower
price.
each
of
the
processes
is
distinct.
that
is
if
the
--
the
poor
talc,
you
run,
sew
and
grind
and
make
face
powder
out
of.
you
don't
sell
it
for
face
powder,
you
sell
it
for
ground
talc.
the
good
talc,
you
cut
into
crayons,
and
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
in
that
case,
the
taxpayer
got
depletion
with
respect
to
its
particular
price
on
that
--
that
which
it
used
for
talc.
for
ground
talc,
it
got
depletion
on
that.
that
what
it'd
used
for
crayon,
it
got
depletion
on
that.
and
then
there
is
the
(inaudible)
case
recently
cited
in
the
tax
court
involving
dolomite
or
building
stone,
a
kind
of
building
stone.
some
of
that
is
used
for
what's
called
dimension
stone.
that
is
these
big
slabs
that
in
this
particular
case
it's
used
for
a
veneer,
not
for
the
huge
building
stones
that
people
used
to
use.
in
making
the
dimension
stone,
there
is
waste.
also
some
of
the
stone
in
the
taxpayer's
quarry
isn't
good
enough
to
make
dimension
stone
because
it
has
cracks
and
other
things
in
it.
the
poor
stone
and
the
waste
are
ground
and
sold
for
fill
and
road
stone.
the
dimension
stone
is
sold
for
a
much
higher
price
for
building
and
the
decision
of
the
tax
court
is
that
the
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
compute
his
depletion
on
the
particular
product
which
it
sold
that
product
being
the
product
which
is
obtained
by
the
ordinary
treatment
processes
normally
applied
by
mine
owners
or
operators
to
obtain
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
thought
about
this
a
great
deal.
the
suppose
my
taxpayer
had
been
brazil
which
would
be
the
--
which
would
be
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
which
would
be
the
problem.
i
would
say
what
every
lawyer
takes
refuge.
in
the
first
place
that
isn't
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
though
i
thought
about
it
a
great
deal,
someone
else
will
think
more
about
it
when
that
case
does
come
up.
i
think
that
i
would
say
that
the
statute
says
the
ordinary
treatment
processes
normally
applied
by
mine
owners
and
mine
operators
to
obtain
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
product.
and
i
think
such
indication
as
there
is
in
this
record,
and
i
repeat,
this
record
is
imperfect
because
issues
like
this
were
not
raised
by
the
--
was
imperfect
on
this
points,
not
raised
in
the
district
court
by
the
government.
that
it
is
clear
that
mine
owners
and
operators
in
the
united
states
in
the
case
of
clay
and
shale
normally
apply
the
same
treatment
processes,
as
here,
to
obtain
the
commercially
marketable
mineral
product.
so
that
i
think
i
would
say
that
if
this
taxpayer
was
in
brazil
that
to
the
extent
that
it
used
the
clay
or
shale
to
make
sewer
pipe
that
it
was
entitled
to
depletion
on
the
sewer
pipe
because
that
is
the
--
the
result
of
the
ordinary
treatment
processes
normally
applied
to
obtain
the
commercially
marketable
product.
if
it's
sold
anything
short
of
that,
of
course,
its
depletion
would
be
limited
by
what
it
sold.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
right.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
so
that
i
would
say
that
--
that
if
this
taxpayer
was
in
brazil,
its
depletion
would
be
entitled
--
it
would
be
entitled
to
take
depletion
on
what
appeared
on
its
book
as
a
result
of
its
sale.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
these
are
the
process
that
normally
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh,
we
quite
agree
that
this
taxpayer
is
not
entitled
to
utilize
any
processes
which
are
not
those
normally
applied
by
mine
owners
or
operators
to
obtain
the
commercially
marketable
product.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
--
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
right.
and
there's
a
lot
of
talk
here
about
manufacturing
and
--
and
things
like
--
like
that
but
--
i've
been
to
a
gold
mine.
the
machinery
and
the
operations
and
whatnot
on
top
of
a
gold
mine
are
far
greater
than
is
involved
in
the
priming
and
cooking
and
whatnot
that's
involved
here
in
--
with
respect
to
clay
and
shale.
these
are
the
things
that
you
do.
if
you
have
a
deposit
of
clay
and
shale,
you
bring
up
your
stuff
and
build
some
kilns
and
grinders
and
make
sewer
pipe.
i
wonder
where
the
market
is.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
of
course,
if
he
never
reaches
a
profit,
mr.
justice,
he
has
no
net
income
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
just
bounded
off
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
it's
net
income
from
the
property.
it
isn't
his
general
net
income.
it's
his
net
income
from
the
property.
and
if
he
can't
sell
anything
of
the
property,
he
gets
no
percentage
depletion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he's
depleted
--
he's
eliminated.
[laughter]
he's
eliminated
himself.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
certainly.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
--
that's
my
position
and
i'm
also
tried
to
say,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
even
if
we
were
in
berlin
--
in
--
in
brazil,
and
made
sewer
pipe
there,
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
depletion
on
sewer
pipe
because
that
is
our
profit.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think,
mr.
justice,
it's
a
case
of
being
big
enough
to
have
an
integrated
plant.
these
people
that
sell
clay
and
shale
in
brazil
are
coal
miners.
they're
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
clay.
they
have
to
dig
it
out
to
get
down
to
the
coal.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
will
get
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
our
position,
the
taxpayer
gets
depletion
on
what
he
sells
as
long
as
that
is
the
result
of
the
ordinary
treatment
processes
normally
applied
and
this
foreman
who
doesn't
exist
in
this
record
will
be
limited
to
depletion
based
on
what
he
sells.
just
as
--
just
as
cannelton
is
surely
limited
to
depletion
on
what
it
sells
in
case
it
sells
and
import
short
of
the
--
of
the
sewer
pipe.
incidentally,
there's
one
aspect
to
the
problem
to
which
reference
hasn't
been
made.
we
talked
about
brick
and
tile.
all
the
cases
agree
that
in
the
case
of
brick
and
tile,
the
depletion
is
obtained
on
the
basis
of
the
finished
product
brick
and
tile
because
there
is
very
little
evidence
of
any
commerce
anywhere
with
respect
to
them
and
i
find
it
hard
to
see
why
people
who
use
clay
and
shale
to
make
brick
and
tile
should
get
it
on
the
brick,
but
people
who
use
clay
and
shale
to
make
sewer
pipes
should
be
limited
to
the
virtually
nonexistent
value
of
the
clay
and
shale
in
place.
the
government
has
developed
many
theories,
none
of
which
can
be
reconciled
with
the
words
used
in
the
statute.
it's
argued
for
distinction
between
mining
and
manufacturing.
it's
talked
about
fit
for
industrial
or
commercial
use.
all
of
these
things
go
back
to
the
words
first
used
by
congress,
gross
value
of
the
mine.
but
congress
long
ago
moved
away
from
any
such
pit
mouth
concept.
none
of
the
theories
which
the
government
has
advanced
here
or
elsewhere
can
be
reconciled
with
the
words
used
by
congress
in
the
commercially
marketable
products
rule.
indeed,
the
government's
difficulty
in
vacillation
in
attempting
to
square
its
basic
position
which
amounts
to
distinguishing
mining
for
manufacturing
with
the
statute
shows
that
it
is
trying
to
read
into
the
statute
something
which
is
not
there.
even
here,
the
government
has
not
taken
a
decision
as
to
how
this
taxpayer's
depletion
deduction
should
be
computed
under
its
interpretation.
if
it
liked
this
court
to
work
that
out
itself,
the
government
nowhere
states
how
the
statute
should
be
applied.
instead,
it
asked
this
court
to
reverse
and
remand
so
that
the
taxpayer's
gross
income
from
mining
may
be
determined
in
the
lower
court.
the
most
that
the
government
says
is
that
the
taxpayers'
depletion
allowance
should
be
computed
with
reference
to
the
raw
fire
clay
and
shale.
but
this
leaves
many
questions
unsolved,
some
of
which
are
apparently
unsolvable.
if
a
local
basis
is
used,
what
is
the
critical
local
market
area?
there
is
no
area
in
which
this
taxpayer
can
be
competitive
in
a
practical
business
sense,
as
far
as
raw
fire
clay
and
shale
are
concerned.
if
some
other
area
is
to
be
used,
there
is
no
logical
basis
why
it
should
be
anything
short
of
the
whole
country,
which
turns
the
local
basis
into
a
national
basis.
or
even
the
whole
world
because
there
are
taxpayers
subject
to
this
law
who
mine
outside
the
united
states.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
