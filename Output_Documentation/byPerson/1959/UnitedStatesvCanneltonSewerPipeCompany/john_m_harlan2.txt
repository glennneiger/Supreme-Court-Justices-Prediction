justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
did
the
--
as
you
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
did
it
hold
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
end
product
was
the
determinative
thing
in
all
instances?
justice
john
m.
harlan
even
though
he's
not
making
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
mean
that
if
the
proof
had
showed
that
this
manufacture
could
have
sold
that
anterior
product
at
a
profit,
that
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
then
that
would
have
been
the
base.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
be
using
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
under
that
theory,
you've
got
no
treatments.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
in
all
events,
it
would
exclude
any
application
of
the
treatment
clause
of
the
section,
does
it
not?
i
thought
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
actually,
they
have
to
get
it
out
of
the
ground,
that
ends
it
from
your
point
of
view
as
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
this
case
--
in
this
case,
you
will
get
no
effect
--
give
no
effect
to
that
treatment
process
clause
of
the
section.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
saying
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
he
is
a
lawyer,
not
a
miner.
justice
john
m.
harlan
up
to
this
point,
has
there
been
any
suggestion
that
there
ought
to
be
a
broader
base
in
depletion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
none?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
what
was
claimed
to
--
to
congress
should
be
the
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
not
individual
taxpayers,
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
interrupt
you
just
a
second
to
see
if
i'm
off
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
on
this?
you
emphasize
commercially
marketable.
now,
of
course,
that
phrase
can
be
given
effect
under
your
theory,
under
the
government's
theory,
as
well
as
yours.you
say
commercially
marketable
means
commercially
marketable
by
the
individual
taxpayer,
as
i
understand
it.
and
the
government
says
commercially
marketable
means
marketable
in
general,
irrespective
of
whether
the
taxpayers
involved
in
that
operation
or
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
self-assessment
argument?
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
it.
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
base
is
the
--
involves
the
product,
mining
product,
that
is
actually
being
made
by
a
particular
taxpayer
or
that
one
that
could
have
been
made
by
him
profitable?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
supposing
these
taxpayers,
supposing
it
was
showing
in
this
record
that
this
--
that
there
was
an
active
market
for
the
clay
and
shale
in
this
very
town,
this
--
your
clients'
operating
from.
what
would
have
been
the
base
in
those
circumstances?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
and
turn
it
around.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)[laughter]
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
self-assessment,
if
it
has
any
virtue
at
all
must
mean
that
it's
a
product
that
is
made
by
the
tax
party.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
he's
depleted
himself.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
are
you
--
you
go
ahead.
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
i
was
going
to
ask
you.
i
understood
dean
griswold
would
argue
that
the
government
had
attempted,
at
least
very
recently,
to
get
congress
to
do
what
you're
trying
to
--
to
get
the
court
do
in
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
now,
what
significance
do
you
--
did
you
get
it?
