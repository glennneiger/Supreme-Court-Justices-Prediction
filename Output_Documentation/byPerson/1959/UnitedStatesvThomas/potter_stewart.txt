mr.
solicitor
general,
it's
very
(inaudible)
--
your
own
kind
of
argument
but
i'm
more
than
a
little
disturbed
personally
about
the
--
the
posture
of
this
case.
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
except
from
the
registrar
and
except
for
mr.
tomas,
the
registrar
and
not
on
the
other
parties
that
--
defendants
are
here.
justice
potter
stewart
their
time
to
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
has
not
yet
expired.
justice
potter
stewart
insofar,
they
haven't
filed
those
appeals,
i
guess,
have
they?
justice
potter
stewart
as
far
as
we
know.
justice
potter
stewart
certiorari
of
course
is
not
being
granted
in
this
case
yet
the
petition
is
pending,
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
there
is
also
of
course
a
motion
here
is
set
aside
to
stay
vacated?
justice
potter
stewart
--
stay,
is
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
what
kind
of
election
is
this
going
to
be
on
the
april
19th?
justice
potter
stewart
state
general
election.
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
which
this
--
now
only
one
candidate
for
democratic
party

the
other
one
is
in
(inaudible)
justice

--
for
governor
(inaudible)
democratic-republican
nominees?
justice
potter
stewart
states
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
this
parish?
where
is
the
washington
parish,
mr.
solicitor?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
a
rural
parish
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
were
references
by
the
counsel
for
the
registrar
that
what
this
really
was
--
was
not
racial
discrimination,
but
that
the
realities
were
that
this
was
a
contest
between
political
facts
in
the
state.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
draw
a
light
at
all
in
that
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

of
--
of
certain
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
state
or
local
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
mr.
solicitor
general.
before
you
sit
down
there,
there
is
a
procedure
laid
before
us
now
two
things,
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
a
motion
to
make
interstate.
with
respect
to
the
latter,
can
you
just
clarify
what
--
what
kind
of
an
election
this
is
going
to
be
on
april
19th?
it's
going
to
be
a
statewide
election
for
governor,
but
the
primaries
are
--
are
already
over.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
have
one
now,
--
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
is
there
--
is
there
any
local
election
with
respect
to
washington
parish,
for
any
local
official?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
state
election
or
city
election?
justice
potter
stewart
only
a
statewide
election?
justice
potter
stewart
