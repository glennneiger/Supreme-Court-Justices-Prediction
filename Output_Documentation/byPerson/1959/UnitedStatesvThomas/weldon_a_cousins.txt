mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
cousins.
that's
correct.
oh,
cousins.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
attorney
general.
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
associate
justices,
this
action
--
i
would
like
to
clear
up
a
few
facts
as
to
how
this
matter
appears
before
this
court.
the
original
complaint
was
filed
by
the
united
states
government
here
under
the
part
iv
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
19
--
the
civil
rights
act
of
1957,
42
u.s.c.
1971
and
particularly
section
a
thereof.
the
original
complaint
asked
for
a
permanent
injunction,
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
by
the
attorney
general
on
behalf
of
the
registrar
of
voters
and
by
the
other
defendants.
after
the
motion
to
dismissed
was
denied,
the
government
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
no,
he
did
not
if
it
pleases
the
court.
i
think
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
just
recently
by
an
act
of
a
new
statute
been
appointed
as
the
counsel
for
the
registrar
of
voters
wherein
he
is
involved
in
federal
litigation
in
courts
for
state's
rights.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
the
other
individuals
--
the
registrar
had
an
individual
counsel
which
does
not
appear
in
this
matter
today
and
the
individual
citizens
who
made
the
initial
challenges
where
represented
by
their
individual
counsel.
none
of
whom
may
have
taken
an
appeal
herein,
the
registrar
being
the
only
one
before
the
court
today.
after
the
motion
to
dismissed
and
was
denied,
the
government
filed
and
a
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction,
various
testimony
was
taken
and
the
government
file
as
to
leave
to
the
court
to
make
copies
of
some
250
registration
cards
which
were
filed
in
the
record
on
a
hearing.
this
matter
was
merely
presented
on
the
evidence
of
affidavits
et
cetera
and
so
forth
there
was
absolutely
in
no
testimony
other
than
one
deposition
taken
of
the
registrar
of
voters.
so,
it's
purely
a
preliminary
injunction
matter
with
no
testimony
involved.
the
decree
on
the
preliminary
injunction
was
the
decree
from
which
the
attorney
general
filed
a
motion
to
stay
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
pending
the
perfection
of
the
appeal.
the
day
the
--
the
appeal
--
the
state
ought
it
was
granted
by
the
circuit
court,
24
hours
later,
this
court
was
furnished
with
a
motion
by
the
united
states
by
the
solicitor
general
for
the
hearing
which
is
here
today
and
of
course
you
aren't
aware
of
the
decree
which
you
rendered
therein.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
on
question,
yes,
if
it
pleases
the
court.
now,
its
context
may
rely
on
those
factors
for
the
purposes
of
its
form,
it
is
to
us
an
interlocutory
decree
of
--
interlocutory
decree.
now,
this
civil
rights
act
under
which
the
--
the
action
is
brought
here
find
it's
origin
in
the
fifteenth
amendment.
of
course,
i'm
sure
--
if
it
apprises
this
court
of
the
wording
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
wherein
it
merely
denies
the
--
the
united
states
or
any
of
the
states
from
abridging
the
rights
of
persons
to
vote
because
of
their
color.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
beg
your
pardon?
if
you
please
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
of
course,
we
are
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
no.
if
it
please
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
no.
i'm
sure
you
that
you're
aware
of
the
fact
of
the
negative
nature
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
wherein
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
where,
section
2?
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i'm
sorry?
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
whereby
congress
may
pass
all
laws
--
and
legislation
in
the
(inaudible)
of
these
powers?
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
am
aware
of
that.
also
of
course
are
contention
here
is
particularly
that
this
matter
which
lends
to
the
constitutionality
of
it,
well,
we
would
like
to
discuss
later,
if
it
please
the
court
right
now,
we're
speaking
of
the
jurisdiction,
the
jurisdictional
clause
of
this
whole
matter
wherein
the
civil
rights
act
comes
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
which
gives
that
negative
power
which
creates
a
negative
power
to
forbid
the
deprivation
of
right
because
of
the
race
and
color
or
creed.
now,
the
civil
rights
act
under
which
this
is
brought
specifically
state
that
the
matter
--
the
subsection
indicates
that
all
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
are
otherwise
qualified
by
law
that's
subsection
8
of
this
matter.
we
have
here
a
question
of
jurisdiction
based
upon
the
fact
our
contention
being
that
these
persons
are
not
otherwise
qualified
by
law.
this
court,
i'm
sure
is
a
(inaudible)
very
many
decisions
wherein
it's
been
said
that
the
question
of
qualifications
of
voters
is
strictly
within
the
states
itself
and
this
--
this
matter
incidentally
does
concern
state
elections.
the
election
is
coming
up
on
the
9th
--
april
19th,
1960
where
it
seems
that
this
necessity
for
reinstating
these
people
back
on
the
road
is
a
state
election
and
no
federal
official
being
involved
in
this
particular
election.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
--
i
was
saying
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
well,
i
--
i
do
not
think
it
--
i
would
carry
my
contention
that
far
if
it
please
the
court,
but
i
would
think
that
a
question
of
qualification
the
--
it's
merely
the
contention
of
the
united
states,
the
complainant
herein,
that
these
persons
are
qualified.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
are
qualified
i
think
should
be
passed
upon
by
a
state
court
and
rightfully
so,
the
qualification
of
voters
being
within
the
state
to
determine
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
yes.
i
understand.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
well,
we
are
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
my
argument
is
--
is
that
part,
portion
of
it,
a
question
is
develop
later
when
we
get
to
the
point
or
whether
or
not
these
people
were
qualified
so
as
to
come
under
this
statute
by
the
facts
in
the
matter.
of
course,
i
will
go
into
that
point
at
this
moment
if
you
wish
please.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
understand
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
would
say
to
answer
to
mr.
--
mr.
justice,
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
clause
are
qualified
is
a
fact
governed
by
the
--
the
literacy
test
as
imposed
by
the
state.
of
course
here,
we
are
dealing
with
a
question
of
fact
whether
or
not
the
discrepancy
of
a
day
or
a
misspelling
of
the
words
and
so
forth
is
enough
to
disqualify
this
person
as
a
voter
merely
because
they
were
on
the
registration
rolls
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
are
qualified
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
for
this
reason
they
may
have
left
their
names
on
the
rolls
and
move
to
a
different
parish,
they
might
have
died,
they
might
have
been
felons
and
lost
their
right
to
vote
because
of
that.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
and
likewise,
i
would
like
to
mention
to
the
court
that
this
mere
challenging,
the
mere
issuance
of
a
challenge,
the
affidavit
of
challenge
does
not
disqualify
a
person
in
louisiana
from
voting.
and
that
i
think
is
a
basic
issue
here
which
the
contention
of
our
argument
that
this
court
lack
jurisdiction
because
this
suit
is
brought
on
a
basis
of
challenges
which
were
issued
to
these
various
points.
when
the
affidavit
of
challenge
is
made
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
--
the
registrar
of
voter
--
voters
as
mentioned
as
much
my
solicitor
general
has
no
discretion
in
the
matter.
he
must
as
a
mandatory
ministerial
act
accept
the
said
challenge.
the
person
who
is
challenged
receives
from
him
within
the
--
within
two
days,
a
citation
in
which
citation
is
stated
the
cause
of
challenge,
the
cause
of
challenge
is
sent
to
this
man.
he
has
10
days
after
receiving
the
citation
to
come
in
and
attempt
to
traverse
the
challenge
made.
if
he
does
successfully
do
so,
he
remains
on
the
rose
as
a
registrar
of
voter
and
he
then
yet
has
a
right
to
vote.
if
he
self-excludes
himself
by
not
answering
the
challenge
within
the
10
days,
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
he
is
the
man
who
had
denied
himself
of
the
right
to
vote
and
not
the
man
who
filed
the
affidavit.
he
had
disqualified
himself
from
voting
by
not
having
answered
the
challenge.
again,
at
the
end
of
the
10
days,
if
he
has
not
answered
this
challenge,
the
registrar
of
voters
again
has
a
mandatory
duty,
not
a
discretionary
duty,
a
mandatory
duty
to
expunge
him
from
the
rose
of
registered
voters.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
yes.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
we
said
the
state
could
not
bar
him
on
a
account
of
color.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
i
would
get
to
the
point
that
the
--
whether
he
was
qualified
or
not
is
the
real
issue,
not
his
color.
there
is
no
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that
is
the
issue.
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
well,
i
would
say
the
sole
issue
is
does
he
have
a
right
to
come
into
the
federal
courts
claiming
abridgment
of
a
constitutional
right.
let's
assume
for
argument
sake
that
one
did
--
an
individual
citizen
did
want
to
--
did
want
to
challenge
him
because
of
his
color.
the
mere
fact
that
this
individual
challenged
him
would
not
give
the
united
states
a
cause
of
action
against
that
individual.
maybe
the
individual
might
have
been
discriminatory
in
his
--
in
his
theory
or
in
his
motivating
cause
for
challenging.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
well,
i
say
by
the
state,
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
yes,
i
would
say
that
the
registrar
had
the
mandatory
duty
but
he
did
not
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
he
did
not
discriminate.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
well,
he
has
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
think
not.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
think
not,
your
honor.
it's
absolutely
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
--
no
evidence
to
that
--
to
that
effect.
each
challenge
issued
has
its
various
defects
which
lend
to
the
literacy
and
to
the
qualification
of
these
parties
which
would
lend
to
a
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
to
whether
or
not
they're
entitled
to
come
in
or
the
united
states
attorney
general
is
entitled
to
come
under
the
civil
rights
act
under
--
under
section
c
which
gives
him
that
entitlement
when
interstate
action
barring
a
party
from
discriminating
against
his
people
solely
on
because
of
race,
color,
or
previous
condition
of
servitude.
to
get
to
the
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that
is
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
you
may
not.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
do
not
agree
with
the
statement
but
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
judge
wright
found
we
claim
that
the
findings
of
fact
or
in
error
for
the
reason
that
the
--
they
were
not
taking--
taken
off
the
rolls
because
they
were
colored,
they
were
taken
off
the
rolls
because
they
did
not
respond
to
the
challenges
issued.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
think
that
it's
not
true
if
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct,
i
do
not.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
said
the
basis
--
the
basis
of
the
challenges
issued
herein
were
because
of
the
lack
of
the
failure
of
these
parties
to
pass
intelligence
test,
the
--
in
the
literacy
test
as
prescribed
by
the
state
laws
for
qualification.
i
should
like
to
show
--
read
to
you
a
couple
of
the
applications
keeping
in
mind
that
these
applications
were
photostated
by
and
at
the
request
of
united
states
government.
they
form
a
part
of
this
record.
however,
by
stipulation
between
counsel,
they
have
not
been
printed
in
the
record
but
these
are
the
identical
copies
which
were
furnished
to
us
by
the
attorney
general
--
the
united
states
attorney
general's
office.
we
have
here
one
from
miss
mamie
myles.
of
course,
she
spells
louisiana
in
outlandish
way
also,
l-o-u-i-s-i-a-n-a.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
l-o-u-i-s-i-a-n-n-a-s,
she
has
washington
spelled,
w-a-s-g-t-o-n
in
answers
the
question,
i
have
recite
in
the
state
since
“all
my
lift
“
l-i-f-t.
in
the
parish
continuously
all
lift,
l-i-f-t.
my
--
my
color
is
black,
my
--
my
sex
is
female,
f-e-l-m-e-l.
i
now,
affiliate
with
the
democratic
party
d-e-n-c-r-a-t-t
party.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
if
he
followed
the
louisiana
law,
he
may
not
incidentally.
i
think
it's
important
to
the
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
yes,
and
he
may
not
--
he
may
not
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
to
refuse
a
challenge?
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
mr.
justice
whittaker's
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
would
say
he
has
a
duty
to
remove
him
if
this
--
if
the
--if
the
--
have
power
affidavits
to
traverse
the
challenge
do
not
successfully
traverse
the
challenge.
however
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
because
the
registrar
of
voters
could
have
an
idea
that
the
--
this
word
spelled
the
way
that
the
registrar
had
spelled
it.
in
which
case,
of
course
the
challenged
party
would
take
the
registrar
to
quote
or
to
court
on
their
mandamus
and
have
the
local
court
--
the
state
court
decide
who
was
correct,
the
registrar
and
the
registrant
or
the
challengers.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
well,
your
honor
if
it
please,
i
think
you
would
be
violating
his
own
knowledge
about
the
matter.
surely,
he
could
do
it
in
confines
of
his
office
but
his
office
requires
him
to
let
only
registered
voters
on
the
rolls.
he
may
even
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
yes.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
would
say
he
would
be
under
duty
--
to
sustain
that
challenge.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
if
he
had
not
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
yes,
i
would
if
he
has
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
if
he
was
challenged.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
would
say
that
he
has
not
met
the
literacy
test.
now,
of
course
we
do
have
a
system
of
where
illiterates
may
vote
under
louisiana
law
where
they
don't
have
to
fill
out
these
cards.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
yes.
if
your
honor
please,
that
would
be
under
the
discretion
of
the
registrar
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
--
whether
or
not
he
want
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
whether
he
wanted
to
file
--
there
is
no
--
i
agree
with
you
that
there
is
no
definite
standards
for
that
as
far
as
i
know
is
to--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
you
honor,
if
may
it
please,
i
think
if
he
does
that
he
is
not
doing
his
duty
under
the
law.
i
think
there
are
certain
standards
have
been
set
by
various
decisions
of
the
courts
as
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
if
your
honor
please
i
don't
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
didn't,
i
said
there
are
many
standards
which
have
been
set
by
the
other
court.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
would
say
that
would
be
strictly
within
the
prerogative
of
the
registrar
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
carry
out
his
duty
if
it
may
please
the
court.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
would
say
he
has
a
duty
to
see
whether
or
not
a
person
who
registers
has
met
the
minimum
literacy
test
of
the
state.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
244,
i
think
it's
a
kind
of
challenge.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
--
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that
is
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
thought
i
answer
that
before
by
saying
he
has
the
power
to
leave
on
the
rolls.
however
again,
the
challenger
has
the
power
to
take
him
into
court
and
let
the
court
determine
whether
or
not
this
applicant
has
met
the
standards.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
your
honor,
of
course,
you're
placing
me
in
the
position
here
of
trying
to
determine
what
each
registrar
around
the
state
of
louisiana
would
do
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
your
honor
here
has
no
more
leeway
than
the
courts
would
allow
him
if
he
allowed
this
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
he
--
if
that
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
the
only
time
when
a
minimum
amount
of
discretion
would
come
in
on
the
part
of
the
registrar
is
the
situation
as
justice
frankfurter
and
justice
whittaker
have
mentioned
that
when
an
attempt
is
made
to
traverse
a
challenge
made
then,
there
would
be
a
certain
play
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
registrar.
however,
that
--
that
discretion
of
his
would
again
be
controlled
by
a
decision
of
the
court
in
case
this
--
in
the
effect,
either
the
challenger
or
the
challenge
would
take
him
to
test
into
the
state
courts.
his
only
discretion
would
lie
as
again
i
repeat
when
affidavits
to
traverse
the
challenge
are
brought
in.
other
than
that,
he
has
no
discretion.
he
must
accept
the
affidavits.
if
the
parties
do
not
come
in
within
the
10
days
prescribed,
he
must
mandatorily
expunge
these
people
from
the
registration
rolls.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
your
honor
if
it
please,
it's
--
it's
conceivable
that
the
person
who
made
the
challenge
was
in
error
in
making
the
challenge
on
the
misspelled
word.
again
like
the
age
here
is
quite
conceivable
at
the
person
who
challenged
on
the
basis
of
age
was
wrong
in
the
challenge,
and
if
a
party
who
was
challenged
could
bring
an
affidavit
to
prove
that
they
were
correct
and
the
challenger
was
in
error,
then
certainly
they'd
be
entitled
to
remain
on
the
rolls.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that
is
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
would
say
that
it
is
conceivable
that
it
could,
if
it
please
justice
frankfurter
for
the
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
would
say
that
this
man
who
has
been
challenged
could
file
three
counter
affidavits
of
persons
who
would
calculate
the
age
the
way
this
registrar
has
calculated.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
your
honor,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
if
it
please
the
court,
this
is
an
allegation
by
a
challenger.
this
is
not
the
decision
of
the
registrar.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
this
is
not
the
decision
of
the
registrar.
this
is
the
an
--
this
is
the
opinion
of
the
challenger.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
well,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that
is
correct
if
it
pleases
the
court,
but
that
would
not
be
a
question
for
this
registrar
to
decide.
he
would
merely
try
to
ascertain
the
correctness
of
the
traversing
affidavits
which
were
presented
by
the
present
challenge.
this
is
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
well
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
may
it
please
the
court
at
--
at
the
state
--
the
state
court
have
held
and
i
think
we
have
some
decisions
to
bear
that
out
that
the
question
of
computing
age
is
a
fact
that
must
be
met
by
some
six
states
in
literacy
test
and
if
the
courts,
the
states
require
that,
then
of
course
they
will
have
to
comply
with
it.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
your
honor,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
certainly
--
first
--
that
even
though
you
might
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
of
course
we
questioned
the
jurisdiction
of
the
matter
principally,
because
we
think
there
is
no
sufficient
case
here
initially
--
this
--
remember
this
action
was
brought
because
these
challengers
had
made
t
--
had
made
this
challenge
and
the
registrar
had
to
accept
the
challenge.
of
course,
that
would
–
we
cannot
deny
that
the
registrar
is
state
action,
but
as
to
the
other
individuals
who
unfortunately
are
not
before
this
court
today,
we
doubt
the
state
action
on
their
part.
of
course,
we
put
the
same
reasons
as
this
court
has
under
the
decision
now
in
the
raines
case
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the
civil
rights
act
itself,
because
of
the
broadness
of
particularly
of
section
--
subsection
a,
thereof
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
would
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
would
think
that
to
find
the
decree
is
an
error
principally
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
--
i
would
say
that
it
does
make
a
difference
to
as
to
the
jurisdictional
standpoint
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
--
if
it
pleases
the
court,
because
there
was
the
action
on
a
part
of
those
individual
was
individual
action
and
not
state
action.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
possibly,
it
could
have
actually
--
it
could
have
been
drawn
against
thomas.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
he
had
been
the
man
who
had
done
--
completed
the
act
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
it
would
be
an
impediment.
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
these
people
having
been
taken
off
of
the
rolls
immediately,
if
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
mention
that
if
this
did
not
happen
in
one
day,
this
is
over
a
period
about
one
year
that
these
various
challenges
were
made.
and
incidentally,
i
think
it's
significant
that
the
court
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
government
in
this
matter
while
they
claim
1377
persons,
there
was
actually
evidence
as
to
only
155
presented
down
in
the
court
below.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
oh,
yes.
if
--
if
not
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
excuse
me.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
if
it
please
the
court,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
he
could
not
under
louisiana
law
you
say.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
yes.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
entirely
so.
yes.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
may
it
please
the
court,
but
we
are
prepared
to
contend
that
this
decree
goes
much
further
than
it
possibly
ever
should
have.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
well,
we
contend
that
the
--
the
language
is
in
error
on
--
on
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
therein
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
if
it
please
the
court,
the
reasons
other
than
absence
of
the
citizen's
council
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
your
honor,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
haven't
examined
each
one
of
these.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
(voice
overlap)
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
you
honor
if
you're
placing
yourself
in
the
position
of
the
registrar
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
the
(inaudible)
registry--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
do
you
know
that
under
the
louisiana
law,
the
registrar
may
not
help
a
registrant
so
if
you're
approaching
me
under
a
position
of
a
registrant,
i
would
not
be
able
to
give
you
the
help
you're
asking.
now,
i
thought
that
was
your
point
in
asking
the
question.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
if
your
honor
please,
i
find
one
year.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
one
day
in
error.
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
if
it
please
the
court,
i
did
not
take
her
off
the
rolls.
she
was
taken
off
the
rolls
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
no.
the
state
--
the
state
didn't
cause
it
that
she
be
taken
off,
but
she
caused
himself
to
be
taken
off
the
rolls
by
not
responding
to
the
challenge.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
our
contention.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
your
honor,
if
it
please,
but
i'd
like
to
mention
something
else
to
this
court,
if
she
responded
to
the
challenge
she
would
be
told
what
was
wrong
with
her
--
with
the
calculation.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
she
--
the
very
next
day,
she
could
go
in
and
then
register
correctly.
there
is
no
deprivation
of
a
voting
right
here,
it
was
the
whole
crops
of
this
thing.
there
is
no
deprivation
of
a
voting
right.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
exactly
right.
everyday
since
these
matters
came
up,
she
could
go
--
any
--
any
day
she
could
had
gone
back.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
had
one
day
older.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
yes.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
your
honor
if
it
please,
i
think
that
would
be
up
to
the
each
registrar
and
if
you
used
the
standard
system
for
everyone,
whether
he
use
--
included
the
day
of
registration
or
whether
he
excluded
the
date
of
registration
would
have
to
be
a
standard
thing
that
he
would
apply
to
all
registrants.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
well.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
think
your
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
if
the
standard
work
to
count
the
--
the
day
as
worked
by
the
office
and
as
set
out
by
the
office.
now,
i
think
she'd
be
obliged
to
comply
with
the
standard
set
by
the
office
for
registration,
it's
part
of
the
literacy
test.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
mr.
justice
black.
nothing,
i
am
personally
trying
to
evade
the
question.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
mr.
robert
has
--
has
an
opportunity,
he
has
the
all
of
the
louisiana
law
to
cover
with
you,
and
if
it
please
the
court
as
much
as
my
time
expired.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that
he
has
no
discretion
in
the
case,
i
think
that
this
statute
does
not
set
out
a
specific
standard
to
the
day.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
well,
you're
speaking
about
the
challenges
of
affidavit,
now
as
to
the
literacy
test
there
are
many
statutes,
the
constitution
also
as
to
the
literacy
test.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
the
discretion
of
the
registrar
actually
comes
out
of
the
language
of
the
case
which
she
filed
against
the
--
these
very
persons
who
were
the
cause
of
this
action.
now,
the
citizen's
council
had
began
to
issue
many
challenges
against
him
and
he
in
attempt
to
avoid
either
to
work
or
to
keep
these
people
on
rolls
filed
a
suit
in
a
23rd
judicial
district
court
asking
of
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
against
these
persons
from
issuing
these
citations
and
affidavits
against
him.
and
therein,
the
court
told
him
that
the
only
time
he
had
no
discretion
in
the
matter,
he
must
necessarily
accept
the
challenge
that
only
time,
any
discretion
on
his
part
might
come
into
play
is
when
he
considered
the
affidavits
to
traverse
the
original
--
original
affidavit
of
challenge.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that
is
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
he
found
(inaudible)
discrimination.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
now,
i
would
say
discriminatory
application
--
i'm
reluctant
to
use
the
word
application.
i
would
prefer
using
discriminatory
use
of
the
law
by
certain
individual
citizens
if
it
pleases
the
court.
but
the
application
of
the
law
stated
by
the
solicitor
general
on
the
part
of
the
registrar
of
voters
was
not
misapplied.
there
were
1377
colored
persons
challenged.
there
were
10
white
persons
challenged.
in
each
instance,
the
registrar
did
his
mandatory
duty
and
issued
the
citations
against
all
point
issues.
so
as
to
him,
there
was
no
misapplication
of
the
law.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
your
honor
if
it
please
the
court,
the
testimony
does
not
bear
out
that
statement
as
--
as
it
was
quoted
to
the
court
here.
the
--
the
registrar
of
voters
was
asked
that
question
at
the
time
of
deposition
of
judge
was
made
for
the
question
for
the
reason
that
this
man
had
not
had
a
chance
to
go
over
the
courts.
and
frankly,
we
--
it's
not
in
a
testimony.
we
feel
the
only
time
in
knew
about
--
this
was
after
this
arose
and
there,
he
was
asked
about
how
many
of
the
white
people
and
he
said
“about
50%.”
he
did
not
say
there
was
this.
he
didn't
know
specifically
of
the
white
discrepancies.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
it
is
on
page
50
and
51
of
the
transcript
please.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
about,
that's
correct.
i
would
not
say
that
he
was
in
positive
knowledge
of
that.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
he
has
a
duty
to
do
it
every
four
years,
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
he
should
do
it
(inaudible)
up
to
date
all
the
time.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
and
as
to
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
so
forth.
many
of
these
application
is
obvious
from
the
reading
from
these
applications
which
were
photocopied
by
the
government
that
they
--
that
registrars
evidently
helped
many
of
these
colored
people
to
get
on
the
rolls.
if
there
was
someone
in
error,
he
was
in
error
but
not
to
a
discriminatory
purpose.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
if
it
pleases
the
court,
answering
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
bring
to
attention
to
the
court
that
before
these
challenges
were
issued,
there
was
90%
colored
people
illegally
on
the
rolls,
now,
there's
only
50%
white
people
illegally
on
the
rolls.
but
before
these
challenges
were
issued,
they
too
did
not
qualify
and
they
were
9
--
they
represent
90%
of
the
colored
vote
on
the
roll.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
so,
there
certainly
cannot
be
said
they're
been
discriminate
against
by
having
been
left
on
the
rolls
in
a
--
ineligible
position
and
probably
would
still
have
been
there
if
the
citizen's
council
hadn't
initiated
the
challenge.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
your
honor
if
it
please,
we
would
like
at
this
moment,
if
it
please
the
court
to
get
rid
of
this
registrar
of
voters
but
we
could
mot
because
this
matter
pending.
he
unquestionably
has
been
relax
and
not
competent
in
his
duty.
these
people
should
never
have
gotten
on
the
rolls,
the
whites
or
the
colored
--
colored
who
were
unqualified.
however,
nothing
was
done,
nothing
will
be
done
until
this
matter
is
determined.
he
unquestionably
only
eligible
qualified
voters
in
the
state
rebelled
against
this
thing.
well
here,
we
have
so
many
unqualified
people
on
the
roll.
each
unqualified
vote
nullifies
both
of
the
qualified
persons.
so,
certain
the
white
--
the
qualified
persons
do
not
whether
they're
white
or
colored
to
be
on
the
rose
anymore.
this
is
just
a
practical
political
thing
that
has
been
done
somewhere
along
the
line.
these
people
got
on
the
roll
when
it
rolls,
when
they
weren't
entitled
to
and
the
machinery
of
the
state
allowed
just
such
a
purge
as
was
the
challenging
system
is
put
in
not
for
purge
but
to
protect
the
rolls
from
this
sort
of
practical
politics
being
executed
in
the
state.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
there
it
might
sound
please
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
if
it
please,
the
parish
of
new
orleans
is
practically,
many
of
the
parishes
have
white
--
white
purges
washington
parish,
orleans
parish.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
political
purposes.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
various
reason,
any
reason,
the
same
reasons
that
there
on
this
court.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
those
are
identical
reasons
if
it
may
please
the
court
that
they
use
in
every
instance
to
get
white
people
off
the
rolls
as
well
colored
people
of
the
rolls.
it's
a
practical
political
maneuver.
it
is
not
discrimination
when
it's
against
to
white
people.
he
had
to
tell
he
has
a
discrimination
once
against
the
colored
people,
but
the
same
system
is
used
all
over
the
state
as
against
whites
by
one
political
fraction
as
against
the
other
political
fraction.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
would
say
it
very
definitely
could
be
your
honor.
i
am
not
to
pass
on
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
--
a
discrimination.
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
say
it
is
done
as
political
matter
all
over
the
state.
it's
a
practical
political
matter.
we
have
the
ccda.
we'll
get
against
the
rdo
voters
when
they
think
they
have
people
who
are
not
registered
properly
on
the
rolls
and
the
various
fractions
throughout
the
state
will
use
this
very
law
to
purge
the
rolls
of
voters
who
--
when
they
--
when
political
passion
might
get
each
registrar
of
voters
in
there
who
will
be
over
solicitors
and
over
generous
towards
a
registrar
and
get
the
roll
chuck
full
of
people
who
are
not
--
normally
not
be
qualified
because
there
is
a
vote
block
to
be
had
there.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
we
would
not
let
him
do
anything
until
we
get
this
matter
to
settle.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
i
beg
pardon?
i
say
that
we
would
not
let
him
do
something.
frankly,
i
do
not
know
at
this
moment,
if
it
please
the
court.
personally
i
--
i
have
no
knowledge
with
that.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
the
attorney
general
does
not
have
that
authority.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
the
registrar
--
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
the
registrar
of
voters
himself
and
other
qualified
registered
voters.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
or
the
registrar
himself.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
(inaudible)
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that's
correct.
mr.
weldon
a.
cousins
that
is
right,
thank
you.
