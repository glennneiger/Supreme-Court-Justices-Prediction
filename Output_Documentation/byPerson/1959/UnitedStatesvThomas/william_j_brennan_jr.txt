justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
was
there
any
evidence
that
the
cards
of
colored
voters
are
kept
separately
from
the
cards
of
white
voters?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
kept
alphabetically
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
they
take
these
out
only
by
examining
every
card?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
would
--
this
is
because
of
that
one
question
that's
filled
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
either
negro,
colored
or
white,
if
the
case
maybe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wouldn't
that
require
pretty
much
examination
of
all
15,000
cards
in
order
to
call
out
the
1500
with
their
color?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there's
no
evidence
here
at
all
how
they
happen
to
pick
out
the
1377
whether
through
examination
of
all
15,000
or
some
less
in
them?
