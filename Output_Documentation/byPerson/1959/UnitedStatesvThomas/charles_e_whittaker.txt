justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there's
two
affidavit
as
i
understand
(inaudible)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
or
not
have
been
done
by
voters.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
that
mean
he
must
remove
them
from
the
rolls
or
does
he
have
a
discretion,
after
a
challenge
has
been
initiated
by
these
two
affidavits,
send
out
a
notice,
then
when
the
voter
responds
to
make
the
determination
for
himself
as
to
qualifications?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
do
i
understand,
i
mean
to
get
this
point
clear
in
my
mind,
that
it
has
been
held
by
some
court
down
there,
that
in
the
(inaudible)
of
response
by
the
voter,
you
have
thus
been
challenged,
you
used
the
affidavits
in
the
statutory
laws,
the
registrar
has
no
discretion
to
overrule
the
challenge,
but
must
remove
the
voter
from
the
rolls.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
one
more
question
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
could
i
ask
you
one
question
and
i
won't
interrupt
you.
you
mentioned
the
1950
injunction
that
had
been
issued
against
this
registrar.
what
court
was
that
issued
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
there
a
--
is
that
a
cited
case,
was
there
an
opinion
written?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
i
promise
that
would
be
all.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
--
is
there
any
record
--
as
i
understand
the
registrar
is
the
only
respondent
(inaudible),
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
can
the
registrar
be
chargeable
with
the
dissemination
in
–
in
any
way
in
the
filing
of
affidavit
against
the
negroes
but
not
against
the
whites?
he
had
anything
to
do
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
why
i
was
interested
to
know
whether
he
had
a
discretion
to
deny
the
challenge?
he
has
apparently
no
power
to
initiate
a
challenge
against
anyone.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
--
then
two
affidavits
(inaudible)
one
challenge
and
not
required?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
somebody
--
is
there
some
other
way
to
initiate
that
thing?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
when
is
he
making
(inaudible)
about
it,
he
might
have
(inaudible)
over
here,
the
same
discrepancies
on
negroes
and
whites
and
affidavits
were
presented
to
him
challenging
the
negroes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
no
affidavits
presented
to
him
challenging
the
whites.
now
what
can
he
do?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
then
that
should
give
him
the
right
to
overrule
the
challenge
and
refuse
to
remove
the
challenge
of
negro
voters,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
thank
you
very
much.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
not
accused
of?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
also
aware,
being
aware,
what
can
he
do,
the
registrar?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
what
clause
did
it
use
to
(inaudible)
it
disqualified
as
one
(inaudible)
disqualified
vote.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
you're
right
in
the
statements
you've
just
made,
this
irregular,
type
of
irregular
argument
was
not
the
constitutional
basis
upon
which
the
registrar
may
expel
them
from
the
rolls
then
that
ends
your
(inaudible),
doesn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
didn't
say,
i
said
assume
we
did
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
trial
court's
finding
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
see
how
you
read
it
between
those
temporary.
however,
as
well
as
the
record
153
and
154,
(inaudible)
the
court
is
called
on
to
take
a
further
step,
i
don't
think
you
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
with
this
very
jurisdiction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
--
i'm
just
still
concerned
about
that
question.
now,
let's
take
section
244
of
record
--
at
the
louisiana's
brief,
122.
now,
let
me
--
this
says,
“whenever
the
registrar
has
reason
to
believe
that
any
name
on
the
registration
record
has
been
illegally
or
fraudulently
placed
there
then
he
may
ask,”
on
the
next
section
of
--
at
this
brief,
page
125,
section
245
says,
“upon
a
written
affidavit
signed
and
sworn
to
unduplicated
before
and
filed
with
the
registrar
his
deputy
by
two
bona
fide
voter
--
registered
voters,
he
must
act.”
now,
suppose
that
the
registrar
under
section
244
does
not
believe
these
irregularities
make
the
registration
illegal,
he
therefore
doesn't
ask.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
--
but
under
--
but
--
but
under
245,
affidavits
are
filed,
and
then
you
tell
us
that
he
must
act
and
that
he
has
no
discretion
even
to
find
against
the
challenge.
is
that
what
you
want
us
to
understand?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
by
244?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
only
if
he
believes
that
he
has
reason
to
believe,
then
he
being
convinced
may
act,
but
under
245
that
the
affidavits
he'd
filed,
he
must
act.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
is
it
true
that
he
has
no
discretion
under
245
to
sustain
the
registration
and
overrule
the
challenge?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
if
that
violated
the
supreme
federal
rights,
but
of
course
he
did
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
was
added
up
for
me.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
duty?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
--
mr.
cousins,
i'm
interested
to
know,
could
the
registrar
as
matter
of
right
have
refused
to
sustain
challenges
on
those
particular
persons,
to
those
particular
reasons?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
same
thing
to
reject
to
--
to
overrule
the
challenge
even
though
these
spelling
errors
appear
may
been
presented
by
the
affidavit
signed
by
two
voters
challenging
the
voter,
the
voter
comes
in
and
he
says,
“yes,
i
admit
that
i
made
these
spelling
errors,”
does
the
registrars
do
have
power
to
leave
him
on
the
rolls?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
can't
--
he
can't
by
counter
affidavits
correct
the
spelling
on
the
registration
card
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
prerogatives,
you
mean
discretion
or
duty?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you're
speaking
under
section
244
now,
that's
under
section
244?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right,
now,
let's
go
to
245
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
which
is
mr.
justice
black
situation
where
the
man
is
presented
the
affidavit,
two
affidavits
have
been
presented
against
him,
saying
he
misspelled
the
word
--
the
word
louisiana,
he
has
10
days
within
which
to
rejoin,
doesn't
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
comes
in
but
he
cannot
correct
the
misspelling
of
louisiana
in
the
original
registration
challenge.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
answering
mr.
justice
black's
question
quite
specifically
has
the
registrar
any
power
to
leave
him
on
the
roll
or
must
he
strike
him
off?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
the,
but
--
but
how
--
please
tell
me
i
don't
understand
how
would
i
go
about
traversing
by
an
affidavit,
a
misspelled
word
in
the
registration
certificate?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
sections
244
and
245.
245
is
the
one
you
most
nearer
to
what
you're
referring
to,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
about
the
discretion
of
the
registrar?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
--
mr.
solicitor,
is
there
any
claim
involved
here
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
louisiana
statute
section
244
or
245?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
notice
counsel
for
louisiana
when
i
asked
this
question,
shake
their
head
negatively
which
i
take
to
be
an
agreement
that
there
is
no
constitutional
challenge
of
the
statutes
that
i
have
mentioned.
so
then
--
that
says
otherwise,
you
might
have
a
jurisdictional
question
whether
or
not,
this
should
be
one
of
the
three-judge
court.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
--
is
there
--
first
of
all,
only
the
registrar
is
here.
is
there
any
way
of
affecting
all
the
parties
to
this
suit
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
other
--
other
than
to
stay
and
to
vacate
to
stay
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
have
you
a
preference
as
to
whether
in
request
that
we
should
vacate
to
stay
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
determine
this
case
on
its
merits
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
thank
you.
