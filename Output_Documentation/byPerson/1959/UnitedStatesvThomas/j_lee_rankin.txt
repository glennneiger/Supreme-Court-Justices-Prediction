mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
involving
the
right
of
1377
negroes
to
be
restored
to
the
registration
rolls
of
washington
parish
in
louisiana.
it
is
distinguishable
from
raines
in
that
raines
involved
the
question
of
their
being
placed
upon
the
registration
rolls
in
the
state
of
georgia.
in
this
case,
the
district
judge,
in
his
decree,
held
that
the
action
involved
massive
discrimination
against
these
negro
voters.
the
various
acts
that
were
involved
resulted
from
challenges
under
the
statute
of
louisiana.
the
statute
of
louisiana
provides
for
challenges
in
a
certain
manner
and
that
is
set
out
in
a
government's
brief.
the
challenges
maybe
made
by
persons,
voters
who
will
swear
out
affidavits
in
regard
to
the
discrepancy
in
a
form
that
is
described
in
the
statute
and
it's
exhibit
here
in
our
brief,
in
which
this
discrepancies
are
raised.
then
the
registrar
acts
upon
those
affidavits
which
are
to
be
sworn
out
before
the
registrar
or
his
deputy.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
at
least
two
voters.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
mr.
justice
whittaker.
in
this
case,
if
the
record
is
clear,
it's
submitted
that
no
examination
of
any
ward
in
regard
to
whether
voters
were
in
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
the
registration
laws
was
made
where
there
were
no
negro
voters
in
that
ward.
there
were
only
10
white
voters'
registrations,
who
were
challenged
in
any
way
in
washington
parish
in
connection
with
this
matter.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
registrar
who
deals
with
these
records
day
by
day
and
continuously
over
a
long
period
of
years
that
he
described,
knew
that
over
50%
of
the
registrations'
records
of
the
white
voters
in
this
parish
had
exactly
the
same
kind
of
discrepancies
that
were
found
to
be
sufficient
under
these
challenges
to
remove
these
colored
voters
from
the
registration
rolls
of
this
parish.
there
were
1514,
colored
voters
registered
in
that
parish
before
this
action
occurred.
by
this
action,
1377
of
those
1514
were
removed
from
the
rolls.
there
are
over
11,000
white,
11,444
to
be
exact,
on
the
registration
rolls
in
this
parish
and
only
10
of
them
were
challenged.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
registrar
has
to
act
but
as
a
part
of
proceedings,
it
is
shown
at
the
registrar
here,
mr.
thomas,
brought
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
in
which
he
said
these
people
were
harassing,
interfering
with
the
conduct
of
his
office
and
that
he
wanted
an
adjudication
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
to
make
these
removals
from
the
registration
rolls
and
whether
or
not
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
injunction
outstanding
against
him
from
1950
in
which
he
was
directed
by
a
federal
district
court
not
to
discriminate
against
any
voters
in
the
registration
by
reason
of
their
race
or
color.
and
in
this
proceeding,
the
state
district
judge
held
that
he
--
his
function
was
ministerial
and
that
he
had
no
discretion
and
that
he
was,
as
soon
as
the
challenge
was
filed
that
he
was
to
proceed
to
remove
them
from
the
rolls
that
was
his
duty.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
yes,
but
if
there
was
no
response
i
think
is
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
state
judge's
decision,
then
he
had
no
discretion
that
it
was
his
–
then
his
duty.
now,
there
is
an
affidavit
provided
for
in
the
state
law,
state
statutes,
in
which
they
can
respond
by
getting
three
voters
to
swear
on
affidavit
on
their
behalf.
this
affidavit
is
a
--
a
limited
form
and
it's
provided
that
they
are
residents
of
the
district
in
effect.
the
court
held
this
affidavit
in
the
form
required
by
the
louisiana
laws
will
be
no
answer
to
these
particular
discrepancies
because
the
--
the
court
said
that
they
would
have
to
swear
out
an
affidavit
in
which
they
would
say
that
these
particular
discrepancies
did
not
appear
or
did
not
occur
on
the
record.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
my
understanding
of
the
judgment
of
the
state
court,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
--
and
the
issue
is,
i
might
add
there
issue
was
further
raised
by
the
registrar
whether
this
type
of
discrepancy
was
sufficient
for
them
to
be
removed
from
the
rolls.
now
the
discrepancies
involved
here
were
misspelling,
the
miscalculation
of
the
age
and
illegibility
and
in
a
few
cases,
there
is
one
about
whether
or
not
he
was
registered
in
any
ward.
now,
it's
the
problem
about
age
is
where
many
of
them
missed
the
age
by
one
day.
the
state
attorney
general
has
said
that
is
not
a
disqualification,
but
the
state
court
judge
said
it
was
and
the
missed
one
day,
depends
upon
whether
you're
going
to
calculate
it
by
figuring
in
the
day
of
the
filing
or
you
figure
it
out.
now,
that's
one
and
then
the
question
of
misspelling.
it's
a
--
a
very
interesting
exhibit
attached
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
to
show
you
just
how
this
worked
in
the
operation
and
what
in
a
front
it
is
to
the
people
of
louisiana,
including
these
voters
and
the
american
people
to
be
saying
that
these
negro
voters
were
disqualified
in
the
voting
process
by
reason
of
what
happened
here.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
11,444.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
don't,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
was
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
was
a
--
it's
set
out
in
the
record
here
on
pages
99
and
100.
the
effective
orders
are
on
page
100
at
the
top
of
the
page,
the
two
paragraphs.
one
is
summarized,
restrained
from
denying
and
refusing
to
register
eligible
negro
--
negroes
as
electors
in
this
very
issue.
solely,
on
account
of
raising
color
and
the
second
one
is
an
injunction
against
making
any
distinction
based
upon
raising
color
and
the
registration
of
collectors
in
washington
parish.
that
was
outstanding
from
the
date
by
the
same
district
judge
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
the
time
for
appeal
is
not
yet
up
for
the
other
parties
and
they
would
have
i
think
until
march
if
in
case
they
want
to
notice
an
appeal
and
at
the
time
the
government's
filing
they
had
not
noticed.
so,
the
only
person
who
had
noticed
an
appeal
was
the
registrar.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
has
the
duty
to
administer
these
registration
rolls
and
if
he,
as
he
testified
he
knew
that
over
50%
of
the
white
had
exactly
the
same
condition.
he
had
a
duty
with
regard
to
those
whites
as
well
as
the
colored,
if
he
was
going
to
administer
these
as
being
grounds
for
removing
them
from
the
rolls.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there's
no
decision
of
that
kind
and
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
a
fair
conclusion
from
the
decision
of
the
state
court.
apparently,
he
has
the
power
to
initiate
on
his
own
the
--
if
a
certain
person
does
not
come
in
within
the
statutory
requirement,
that's
his
function.
so
that
he
--
he
has
the
power,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
disputed
here
to
have
removed
this
50%
of
the
whites
if
he'd
proceeded
to
do
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
is
for
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
that
can
start
the
procedure
whereby
he
then
the
court
said,
has
a
ministerial
duty
to
proceed
to
do
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
he
has
the
power
and
duty
as
the
court
said
to
carry
out
the
statutes
and
he
knew
that
this
record
showed
that
the
same
disabilities
occurred
on
50%
of
the
whites.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he's
not
helpless
because
he
has
to
take
into
account
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
federal
law
which
is
primary
and
supreme
and
controlling
his
action
as
long
he's
--
as
you
knows
that
the
particular
acts
that
he
is
act
--
asked
to
do
are
in
violation
or
discriminatory
of
his
own
knowledge
then
it's
his
duty
under
the
law
that's
supreme
not
to
carry
it
out.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
would
have
the
duty
not
to
exercise
that
challenge.
it's
the
contention
of
the
government
whenever
it's
discriminatory
because
that
is
prohibited
by
federal
law
and
that's
supreme,
but
i
was
trying
to
tell
you
what
the
state
court
had
held
was
his
duty
in
regard
to
these
particular
challenges
ones
they
came
to
him.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
if
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
you're
--
you're
within
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you're
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
think
it's
right
within
in
re
neagle,
that's
--
where
the
two
come
into
clash
that
the
can
follow
his
federal
duty
and
proceeding
in
accordance
for
that
law.
now,
if
you
will
turn
to
exhibits
on
the
appendix
42
(a)
and
notice
the
photo
stub
there,
you'll
see
that
mrs.
affoway
smith
in
the
first
one
on
the
left
hand
side
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
of
the
governments
brief
--
the
government
--
i'm
sorry,
the
governments
brief,
page
42
(a),
there's
a
photo
stub
that
you
unfold.
you'll
notice
affoway
smith
and
the
--
the
registration
application
in
louisiana
records
the
fact
of
what's
their
race
or
color
is,
they're
supposed
to
put
that
down.
one
of
the
things
that
they
challenged
them
for
and
they've
been
removed
from
the
rolls
in
--
in
some
of
these
matters
for
is
the
fact
that
they
put
down
c
or
colored,
instead
of
black
or
they
put
down
negro
instead
of
black
and
that
is
the
ground
that
they
have
exercised
the
challenge
and
said
that
doesn't
comply
with
their
statutory
requirement.
that
isn't
true
of
this
one,
but
i
just
want
to
point
that
out
as
in
you
are
examining
it.
now,
this
woman
missed
the
date
of
the
note
--
the
time
that
she
had
lived
by
one
day
depending
upon
why
do
you
include
the
date
of
the
application?
now
she
is
a
teacher
as
you'll
note
from
the
--
the
blank
there
in
the
application
blank.
now,
if
you
move
down
to
the
blank
just
below
that,
you'll
find
the
one
of
mrs.
william
a.
luis.
she
is
also
a
teacher
and
she
happens
to
be
a
white
teacher,
but
she
can't
spell
what
the
state
of
louisiana.
she's
spelled
it
l.o.u.i.s.i.a.n.i.a.,
but
nobody
challenges
her.
nobody
removes
her
from
the
rolls
and
when
she
fills
in
the
blank,
the
name
of
the
householder
at
the
present
address
is,
that
should
be
her
own
name
if
that's
who
the
householder
is
but
she
fills
in
4632
avenue
g,
which
is
a
improper
answer
to
the
question
the
way
they've
been
running
and
so
she
should
have
been
challenged
by
anybody
who
was
trying
to
be
non-discriminatory
and
moved
off
the
rolls,
but
there's
the
white
sign
there
and
of
course
you
don't
that.
now,
you
go
to
the
next
page
of
the
photostatic
copy.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
there
was
proof
that
the
registrar
worked
for
these
records
all
the
time
and
knew,
but
there
was
no
proof
that
these
particular
members
of
the
citizens'
counsel,
white
citizen's
counsel
that
filed
his
challenges
had
examined
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
well,
let
me
see
if
this
will
answer
your
questions
mr.
justice
harlan
in
this
regard.
i
--
squarely,
i
don't
think
there
--
there
wasn't
any
proof
that
this
particular
application
was
looked
at
except
that
it
came
during
the
trial,
but
the
registrar
testified,
admitted
that
50%
of
these
applications
in
his
office,
he
knew
to
have
the
same
discrepancies
as
those
of
the
colored
that
he
removed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
--
that's
admitted.
so,
there's
no
question
but
he
was
aware
now
but
he
was
aware
now,
whether
he
was
aware
of
just
affoway
smith,
i
--
i
wouldn't
say
for
a
moment
but
he
was
aware
that
--
that
it
was
all
through
his
record
as
to
the
whites
and
that
would
be
some
six
better
than
5,000
--
5,500
that
were
--
that
way
with
the
white.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
he
has
the
power
to
correct
that
situation.
he
has
difficult
problems
politically
if
he
does,
but
he
has
the
power
to
comply
with
these
statutes,
if
these
--
if
that's
what
the
statutes
mean.
i
think
that
question
is
not
now
before
the
court
in
a
way
this
record
is.
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
proper
construction
of
these
statutes
to
say
that
to
miss
the
day
of
the
time
you
are
--
have
lived
by
one
day
just
because
you
don't
whether
the
statutes
means
that
you
shall
include
the
day
of
the
application
or
not
include
it
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
this
statute
at
all.
and
i
don't
think
if
you
misspelled
louisiana
because
you
add
an
extra
"i",
well
that
should
be
have
any
relation
to
your
fitness
to
be
a
voter
in
the
state
of
louisiana
or
on
the
other
state.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
i'm
saying
and
if
the
registrar
has
the
duty
to
abide
these
statutes,
it's
his
function
not
only
to
act
under
challenges,
but
to
act
directly
if
these
are
real
basic
discrepancies
that
should
control
his
right
to
be
on
the
vote
rolls.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
i
claim
he
could.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
i
--
i
say
these
aren't
enough
if
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
i
say
this
type
of
discrepancy
should
not
have
any
bearing
under
the
law.
i
don't
think
its
constitutional
to
they
have
that
kind
of
a
measure
of
whether
persons
are
qualified
both.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
has
no
reasonable
relationship
with
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
my
view,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
he
has
that
power
and
the
duty
and
i
think
that
was
–
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now
on
this
next
page
of
the
photo
stats,
mr.
james
d.
cyrus
misspelled
pearl
river
which
was
the
county,
that's
on
page
42
(b)
of
the
government's
brief
and
you'll
note
here
is
a
negro
and
he
was
challenged
and
removed
from
the
list.
then
if
you
go
there
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
pearl
river.
he
spelled,
p.e.r.a.l
transposed
the
r
and
the
l
and
then
if
you
go
to
the
next
one,
herman
manning
you'll
notice
he
--
the
way
he
put
his
name
in
the
first
part
there,
he
didn't
spell
it
right
at
all.
he
mixed
up
the
herman
and
the
manning
so
it's
hardly
possible
to
decide
what
he
meant
and
then
the
when
he
put
down
his
sex,
he
put
down
“f”
for
female,
i
guess
for
a
man.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
haven't
heard
of
herman
not
disclosed
in
the
record.[laughter]
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
there's
a
circle
around
mr.
too,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
didn't
see
--
catch
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
trying
to
make
it
out
in
this
signature
mr.
justice
frank
--
whittaker
at
the
bottom
down
there.
you
see,
his
got
his
signature
down
and
then
he
let
it
put
the
name
in
up
above,
it's
different.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
assume
he
did
but
i
--
that
isn't
the
evidence
in
proof.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that's
admitted
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
what
i'm
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
--
no,
there
is
not
to
answer
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
this
illuminates
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
kind
of
problem
that
we're
dealing
with
in
this
area.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
they
‘re
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
would
think
some
of
the
--
the
findings
as
to
the
conclusions,
the
court
made
in
regard
to
some
of
the
facts
as
to
–-
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
on
some
parts
of
that
--
there
--
there's
no
issue
on
the
facts
mr.
justice
black.
on
the
–
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
there
were.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
submitted
findings
of
their
own
which
were
not
the
same
as
the
governments.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
was
a
in
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
it
was
incomplete
mr.
justice
frankfurter
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
because
the
notice
to
appeal
had
been
filed
but
they
had
obtained
a
stay
and
so
we
argue
points
here
in
anticipation
of
positions
that
they
might
take.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
have
taken
some
in
their
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
the
factual
situation
it
does
not
seem
to
be
an
issue
between
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
as
i
recall.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
my
recollection
is
the
brief
does
not
put
an
issue
of
these
facts.
it
puts
an
issue,
the
legal
questions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there's
one
other
thing
before
a
proceedings
to
the
legal
arguments
that
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
and
that
is,
that
by
these
tests
which
i
want
and
i
think
you'll
understand
me
but
i
want
to
make
clear
the
government
does
not
think
are
valid
constitutional
tests
anyway
to
apply
these
discrepancies
in
this
manner,
but
they
were
applied
in
this
discriminatory
manner,
but
regardless
of
that,
if
you
apply
it
as
they
did,
and
if
you
would
apply
them
across
the
board
to
both
colored
and
whites,
this
record
demonstrates
that
you
would
eliminate
90%
of
the
colored
by
this
kind
of
discrepancy
and
50%
of
the
whites.
now,
they
didn't
do
that,
they
only
challenged
10%
--
10
of
the
whites.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
if
you
would
conclude
that.
now
that
was
not
–
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
decision
below
and
you
might
not
--
and
you
wouldn't
reach
that
question
if
you
found
a
discrimination
contrary
to
the
constitution
which
was
the
basis
of
the
lower
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
you
found
that
he
was,
it
is
judgment
to
that
effect
was
valid.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
trial
courts
finding--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
and
they
were
fully
supportive
and
much
of
it,
there
was
no
controversy
about
it
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
have
the
permanent
injunction.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
true.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
wouldn't
the
--
this
test
that
the
state
has
to
apply
about
voting
in
regard
to
--
certainly
in
regard
to
federal
elections
have
to
be
reasonably
rate
--
related
to
that
franchise
or
that
voting.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
and
if
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
is
a
different
problem.
i
do
think
it's
important
to
--
in
regard
to
literacy
as
the
court
did
in
the
lastner
case
to
keep
in
mind
that
if
your
literacy
test
is
one
that
obviously
is
going
to
discriminate
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
on
the
basis
of
raise
or
color,
then
it's
one
that
can't
stand
up
against
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
very
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
long
as
it's
really
related
to
literacy,
i
wouldn't
have
any
real
problem
about
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
thought
that
it
was
a
preliminary
injunction
originally
and
then
they
granted
permanent.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
still
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
inquired
about
that
from
the
man
who
tried
the
case
and
he
thought
it
was
a
permanent
injunction.
so,
i
think
possibly
it's
the
same
difficulty
that
you
justices
are
having
with
it
that
it
was
a
denominated
preliminary,
but
in
a
form
it
was
quite
permanent.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
the
reason
i
have
dwelled
upon
this
proposition
of
the
discrepancy
and
the
effect
of
this
--
even
this
type
of
discrepancies
or
--
or
defects
in
these
applications
was
that
this
case
presents
to
the
court
the
problem
even
if
it
has
been
administered
fairly
and
without
discrimination
as
far
as
applying
the
same
test
to
the
white
as
to
the
black,
you
would
have
a
discrimination
in
effect
because
you
would
eliminate
50%
by
this
test
of
the
white
as
against
90%
of
the
black.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
anticipated
that
they
might
make
that
claim
in
the
way
this
case
came
up
you
see,
because
we
didn't
--
we
weren't
able
to
tell
when
the
court
took
case
by
--
at
the
time
we
filed
out
petitions
and
also
our
brief
what
their
contentions
were
going
to
be.
so,
we
argued
that
as
well
as
the
rest
and
we
have
to
do
that
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
recall
if
they
did
mr.
justice
black,
but
we
did
argue
that
they
were
fully
supported
by
the
evidence
because
the
court
in
taking
the
case
here,
although
we
won
it
below
the
government
did,
the
court
asked
us
if
we
wanted
to
--
to
file
a
petition
by
a
certain
date.
so,
although
we
have
been
the
successful
party
below,
we
filed
the
petition
for
certiorari
here
and
then
we
briefed
it
first
without
knowing
fully
what
the
other
side
was
going
to
develop
against
us.
and
so,
we
tried
to
anticipate
all
the
arguments
that
would
be
open
to
the
parties
if
they
came
and
they
tried
to
show
that
the
findings
in
fact
--
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
filed
one.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
that
was
filed
on
saturday,
this
last
saturday
by
the
court's
order
and
we
--
we
examined
it.
i'm
not
complaining
about
that
at
all,
but
i
just
wanted
to
show
you
how
it
lead
us
to
the
point
where
we
had
to
develop
our
case
and
try
to
anticipate
arguments
as
we
did.
and
so,
we
tried
to
show
that
the
findings
were
fully
justified
and
in
much
of
the
evidence
it
was
admitted.
now,
to
proceed
to
the
question
of
law,
we
get
to
the
question
of
whether
this
is
state
action.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
whether
it's
state
action?
well,
the
contention
is
made
like
in
raines
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
under
subsection
(b).
we
are
treating
subsection
(a)
and
(c).
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
this
case
was
brought
by
the
attorney
general
and
it
was
under
the
power
of
this
statute
of
the
1957
civil
rights
act
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
conceived
that
the
attorney
general's
own
action
could
be
brought
in
--
under
this
particular
statute
for
this
type
of
violation.
now,
the
conspiracy
under
241
was
a
different
problem
as
far
as
the
attorney
general
brings
the
action
himself.
the
--
there's
no
question
but
what
individuals
could
bring
certain
actions
under
the
civil
rights
statutes
before
them.
and
section
(b)
of
this
statute
has
been
construed
by
the
government
to
cover
the
intimidation
and
the
threatening
and
coercion
or
attempt
to
intimidate,
threaten
or
coerce
any
other
person,
mr.
justice
douglas,
rather
than
dealing
with
this
type
of
preventing
or
denying
the
right
to
vote.
see,
it's
--
deals
with
the
intimidation
and
threatening
and
coerce
or
attempt
for
the
process
of
interfering
and
so
forth.
now,
we
--
we
treated
this
as
being
under
subsection
(a)
and
that
the
action
could
be
brought
under
subsection
(b)
because
it
was
not
an
intimidation
or
threatening.
it
was
actually
the
using
of
governmental
process
as
of
the
state
to
accomplish
this
discrimination
and
it
was
a
state
action
because
they
--
they
took
advantage
of
what
the
statute
provided
for
these
affidavit
challenges
and
then
they
submitted
them,
they
swore
to
them
and
used
the
office
of
the
registrar
in
order
to
get
all
the
information.
they
swore
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
were
these
persons
that
swore
out
the
affidavit
who
were
members
of
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
they
were
members
of
the
white
citizens'
council.
they
swore
out
the
affidavits
that
are
provided
for
under
this
state
statute
and
put
into
--
they
triggered,
initiated
the
state
action
and
then
that
registrar
proceeded
to
act
in
accordance
with
their
challenges,
but
they
were
the
ones
that
triggered
that
state
action
and
the
statute
itself
contemplates
that
private
individuals
shall
do
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
because
it's
against
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
a
--
it's
a
panoply.
it's
a
combination.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
--
it's
a
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
maybe
i
can
clarify
mr.
justice
black
that
the
persons
who
filed
the
affidavits
started
the
action,
but
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
but
they
can't
remove
them
from
their
rolls.
the
registrar
has
to
do
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
the
only
problem
we
have
about
a
conspiracy
is
that
the
--
the
evidence
did
not
show
that
the
registrar
conspired
with
these
people.
he
claimed
they
were
interfering
in
this
lawsuit
with
his
operation
and
conduct
of
his
office
and
therefore,
that
he
want
them
to
stop.
that's
what
he
said
anyway
in
the
litigation.
and
yet,
he
proceeded
to
do
all
of
the
things
that
they
wanted
to
do
and
when
they
filed
only
10
affidavits
in
regard
to
whites
in
the
parish,
he
didn't
say,
“well,
what
about
all
these
others
that
i
know
about?”
or,
he
didn't
proceed
to
remove
any
of
those,
but
he
proceeded
to
carry
out
the
discrimination
that
they
had
started.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
you're
going
to
apply
the
state
law
and
disregard
his
federal
duty,
we
say
that
the
federal
duty
doesn't
permit
him
to
act
as
either
one.
but
brushing
that
aside,
the
state
court
said
that
these
were
persons
with
these
discrepancies
were
illegally
on
the
rolls.
so,
he
comes
right
within
their
section
244
because
he
testified,
he
admitted
it,
that
he
knew
that
50%
of
them
have
those
and
he
handled
these
records
everyday.
so,
he
knew
that
50%
were
illegally
on
the
rolls
of
the
white
persons
and
it
was
his
duty
under
that
section
of
the
statute,
if
you
disregard
his
federal
duty
not
to
discriminate
to
remove
them.
it's
clear.
now,
he
said
that
he
didn't
think
these
were
enough
and
so
he
went
to
the
state
court
and
asked
and
the
state
court
said
that
it
was
enough.
the
power
is
certainly
granted
to
him
by
that
section.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
--
the
court
held
--
the
state
court
held
that
he
had
no
discretion
that
it
was
a
ministerial
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that's
what
we
claim
was
his
legal
duty
and
it
overrides
and
it
was
the
supreme
duty
and
therefore,
he
had
no
right
to
do
it.
we
say
he
had
no
right
to
do
it,
because
it
was
discriminatory.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
as
far
as
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
state
court
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
then
i
think
you
put
a
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
clause
on
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
--
that's
my
interpretation
mr.
justice
harlan
and
then
i
think
you
put
gloss
of
the
federal
law
as
to
determine
what's
supreme.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
he
had
the
power
according
to
the
state
court's
interpretation
to
act
on
his
own
under
the
first
section
and
--
well,
the
court
told
him,
"these
were
enough"
so
he
had
no
discretion
mr.
justice
whittaker
once
he
was
told
that
he
by
--
by
the
court
that
this
was
enough
as
far
as
the
state
court
law
was
concerned,
that
section
--
the
statute
gave
him
the
power
to
act
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
had
duty
to
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
they're
illegal
according
to
the
state
court
decision
and
there
you
get
into
the
question
of
the
discrimination
between
the
two.
now,
the
further
question
was
raised
in
regard
to
the
type
of
relief
that
was
granted,
whether
or
not
it
was
justified
under
the
circumstances,
and
the
findings
of
the
fact
of
the
court
and
we
think
it
was
amply
justified.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
it
was
contemplated
by
the
congress
at
the
time
the
1957
civil
rights
act
was
passed
that
this
very
type
of
problem
was
discussed
by
the
attorney
general
at
that
time
in
presenting
it
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee,
the
subcommittee
on
constitutional
rights
and
also
before
the
house
judiciary
committee
that
this
very
example
was
discussed
of
this
case,
but
an
--
a
case
is
similar
to
it
in
regard
to
the
persons
being
removed
from
the
registration
rolls
and
how
it
would
be
handled
and
the
senators,
senator
morris
and
senator
kero
discussed
specifically
the
idea
of
their
being
reinstated
upon
the
rolls
so
they'd
be
able
to
vote
and
it
was
also
discussed
by
congressman
miller
in
the
house
judiciary
committee
that
very
thing
and
the
conduct
of
removing
the
registration
rolls
shortly
before
election
in
louisiana
it
was
gone
into
at
length
and
finally,
senator
douglas
asked
that
he
be
supplied
some
information
by
(inaudible)
only
the
third
in
charge
of
the
criminal
division,
regard
to
four
different,
five
different
parishes
that
were
involved
in
removing
these
negroes
from
the
rolls
in
louisiana
in
1956.
and
he
furnished
that
information
in
detail
and
it's
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
showing
how
they
worked
with
this
to
get
them
off
of
the
roll
and
senator
douglas
made
that
a
part
of
his
remarks
when
he
addressed
the
senate
in
regard
to
this
bill
and
some
other
of
this
pretty
shameful
story.
it
tells
how
in
some
places,
the
registrar,
that
isn't
this
case,
but
the
registrar
would
not
allow
more
than
50
attempts
during
the
day
to
get
their
names
–
the
negroes
to
get
their
names
back
on
the
registration
rolls.
they
would
come
there
at
5
o'clock
in
the
morning,
stay
all
day
and
when
50
would
be
completed
then
they
wouldn't
have
anymore
and
that
went
on
for
days
in
this
one
parish
and
they
weren't
able
to
get
many
of
those
names
back
on
the
rolls.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
is
the
suggestion
that
they
tried
to
get
reregister
and
that
is
not
an
easy
process
in
louisiana.
on
page
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
there
--
there
is
a
provision
on
the
constitution
for
going
to
court,
but
their
court
has
divided
on
whether
that
is
proper
or
exclusive
way
and
that
is
referred
to
in
our
--
set
in
the
--
in
the
record
here
and
also
in
briefs
referred
to,
but
there's
also
a
remedy
by
just
trying
to
reregister
again
and
doing
it
correctly,
but
then
you'd
have
to
pass
these
tests.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
then
you
go
to
pass
tests
on
--
on
the
questions
that
set
out
on
page
38
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
you've
got
to
be
a
good
character
and
you've
to
understand
the
duties
and
obligations
of
citizenship
under
republican
form
of
government.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
new
test.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
all
you
got
this
where
that
these
discrepancies
were
there
and
then
you're
liable
for
a
perjury
under
their
statute
if
you
swear
anything
like
that.
well,
you
couldn't
swear
to
that
because
it
would
be
a
false
and
sometimes
this
--
this
legislative
history
shows
in
1956,
they
would
get
some
white
persons
to
swear
off
to
the
statutory
affidavit
for
the
colored
persons.
and
the
registrar
says,
"oh,
you
can't
have
that,
you
got
to
have
colored
persons"
and
when
they
get
to
colored
persons,
they
say,
"oh,
you
got
to
have
an
officer
to
say
that
you're
--
you'd
--
in
this
--
in
this
residence
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
those
are
just
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
those
are
his
rulings
and
some
--
now
there
was
a
case
that
was
described
by
mr.
alaman
to
the
senate
committee
in
which
the
registrar
was
decent
and
fair
about
the
whole
thing
and
when
they
made
the
showing,
he
put
their
names
back
on
the
rolls.
that's
one
out
of
the
five,
but
the
rest
of
it
was
this
history
of
all
kinds
of
arbitrary
things.
now,
there's
also
furnished
as
a
part
of
the
legislative
history
to
senator
douglas
that's
set
out
in
the
appendix
a
copy
of
a
newspaper
account
of
the
fact
that
white
citizen's
counsel
at
in
around
1956
or
thereabouts
decided
upon
this
kind
of
course
of
action
and
trying
to
see
how
they
–
many
negroes,
they
could
get
off
the
registration
list
in
this
--
in
louisiana
and
it's
described
in
detail
and
it's
made
part
of
the
record
by
senator
douglas
when
he
obtained
it
from
mr.
alaman.
and
the
--
the
idea
was
that
even
if
they
had
remove
some
whites,
they
get
as
many
colored
off
as
possible,
they
just
said
so
in
these
to
counsel
there
meetings
and
so
forth.
now,
on
this
particular
action,
this
action
of
these
particular
parties
that
challenged
these
colored
voters
on
this
registration
list
was
approved
and
endorsed
by
the
white
citizen's
council
of
this
parish.
and
it's
a
part
of
that
general
action.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
haven't
checked
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
but
don't
know.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
but
you
must
keep
in
mind
april
19th
of
the
election
date
too.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
the
problem,
there's
one
--
first
thing
to
keep
in
mind
in
that
--
regard
to
that
entire
problem
however,
that
is
a
discriminatory
action
that
we're
talking
about
in
violation
of
the
constitution
and
if
the
discrimination
had
not
occurred,
these
people
along
with
the
whites
would
be
right
on
that
voting
list
and
have
the
opportunity
to
vote
just
like
all
of
these
whites.
there's
no
question
throughout
this
other
people
just
whites
having
a
right
to
vote
regardless
of
a
discrepancies
because
that's
the
way
it's
operates,
no
issue
about
it.
so
that
the
discriminatory
action
is
prohibited
by
the
constitution
that
we're
trying
to
reach
and
that
the
congress
was
trying
to
reach
too
in
passing
this
act,
it
will
just
this
very
business
of
doing
it
at
a
time
when
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
courts
to
act
properly
enough
to
get
it
corrected
and
therefore,
you
got
the
job
done
regardless.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
their
second
election,
their
run
off
election.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
general
election.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
state
general
election.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
have
had
the
–
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
there's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
one
of
these
five
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
states
right
candidate
on
the
other
side.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
would
might
be
difficult
if
we
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
we're
worried
about
both
mr.
justice
clark
because
i
don't
think
these
votes
can
be
evaluated
just
how
valuable
they
are
and
they
even
though
maybe
the
--
the
best
votes
for
a
man
to
have
in
louisiana
is
to
win
the
primary
because
he
has
more
voice
in
the
result
if
he
does
nevertheless,
i
think
if
you
can
--
if
it
can
be
done
by
discrimination
they
can
keep
race
or
color
from
voting
then
just
by
accomplishing
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
it
works
out
as
long
as
they
get
it
done
and
to
defeat
it,
you
have
to
try
to
beat
that
particular
day
if
possible,
that's
our
problem.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
would.
the
only
problem
left
would
be
whether
or
not
they
tried
to
get
additional
challenges
out
and
i
would
think
that
under
this,
the
registrar
wouldn't
recognize
any
additional
challenges
either
wouldn't
dare
to.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
mr.
justice
harlan.
but
i
thought
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
(inaudible)
well,
what
i
was
trying
to
deal
with
the
possibility
that
there
could
be
challenges
again
to
this
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
in
the
light
of
the
state
court
decree
that
he
would
still
have
to
obey
them
at
all,
but
i
think
that's
a
very
remote
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
just
speak
on
very
briefly
about
just
a
couple
of
matters.
i
did
not
anticipate,
although
we
tried
to
anticipate
all
the
arguments
we
could
in
this
case,
that
there
would
be
no
claim
--
that
there
would
be
a
claim
that
there
is
no
attempt
to
purge
the
negroes
from
these
registration
rolls.
we
don't
cite
it
in
our
brief
because
we
did
not
anticipate
it,
but
the
report
of
the
united
states
commission
on
civil
rights
of
1959
in
its
official
document
on
page
101
and
on
through
page
106,
deals
with
the
facts
of
the
deliberate
effort
to
purge
negroes
from
these
registration
rolls
and
sets
out
the
fact
that
mr.
rainey
(ph)
who
was
a
member
of
the
joint
legislative
committee,
to
maintain
segregation,
had
a
mr.
shaw,
as
his
counsel,
who
was
one
of
the
lawyers
arguing
the
larche
case
before
this
court.
and
mr.
shaw
participated
in
instructing
the
registrars
how
to
accomplish
this.
and
the
objective
was
stated
publicly
to
try
to
get
the
130,000
negroes,
then
on
the
registration
rolls
reduced
so
they
wouldn't
be
more
than
13,000,
because
they
had
a
disproportionate
influence
on
the
voting
of
the
people
in
the
state
and
they
were
able
to
get
a
--
an
effect
upon
the
laws
of
the
state
in
the
legislature
and
in
the
government
generally,
because
of
their
voting
pressure
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
with
this
purge
accomplished.
and
then
it
proceeds
to
show
that
exactly
the
instructions
that
were
developed
by
the
white
citizen
council
which
as
described
as
being
the
instruction
prepared
by
the
white
citizen
council
as
to
how
to
develop,
“the
key
to
victory
in
the
segregation
struggle.”
and
then
it
proceeds
to
give
detailed
instructions
as
style
to
accomplish
it.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
tell
just
the
constitutional
test
for
registration
that
should
be
applied
to
accomplish
this
objective.
and
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
--
it
was
not
introduced
in
evidence.
it's
--
i
call
it
to
your
attention
because
an
official
document
report
to
congress
and
it
had
representation
from
the
southern
states
as
well
as
all
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
urge
you
to
--
you
--
in
that
regard,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
i
do
think
it
demonstrates
that
the
figures
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
this
--
this
also
sets
out
tables
of
the
reduction
in
the
vote
of
the
registration
of
the
negroes
parish
by
parish,
as
a
result
of
the
purge.
so,
it
shows
what
the
objective
that
was
set
out
and
what
was
accomplished
in
regard
to
it.
so
that
i
think
it's
very
plain
that
the
history
--
that
that
was
the
objective
to
discriminate
and
they
proceeded
and
it
was
accomplished.
and
it
--
it
was
accomplished
in
the
elections,
at
least,
in
several
areas.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
understand
it's
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
state.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there's
one
large
--
larger
community,
it
isn't
a
very
large
community,
but
one.
and
they
--
the
--
judge
wright
didn't
find
that
there
were
parish
--
there
were
wards
that
had
no
negro
voters
that
were
not
examined
at
all
by
the
challengers.
that
was
one
of
the
important
thing
that
he
said,
he
made.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
believe
that
there
isn't
anything
in
the
record.
there
is
something
in
the
report
of
the
commission
on
civil
rights
that
would
indicate
that
there
is
some
political
controversy
involved
in
it
as
one
group
thinks
that
they
can
get
the
negro
support
and
do
get
it
and
the
others
would
like
to
get
them
out
off
office
and
so
they
like
to
get
rid
of
the
negro
vote
as
a
part
of
that
effort.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
there
is
a
report
also
about
monroe
in
wichita
parish
in
which
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
mayor
and
they
concluded
they
couldn't
do
that
without
getting
rid
of
the
negro
vote
and
they
did
get
rid
of
it
and
they
got
rid
of
the
mayor,
that
kind
of
thing.
so,
it
seems
to
be
tied
in
with
the
objective
of
getting
rid
of
the
negro
vote
because
it
might
contribute
to
one
or
the
other,
as
well
as
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
an
indirect
byproduct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
that's
properly
before
the
court
this
time.
if
it
was
the
only
issue
in
the
case,
we
would
--
the
government
takes
the
position
that
this
kind
of
an
application
of
those
statutes
was
never
contemplated,
it
is
unreasonable
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
a
person
is
properly
qualified
to
vote
and
therefore,
would
be
unconstitutionally
caused
therefore.
i
don't
think
the
court
ever
has
to
reach
that
because
it
wasn't
decided
in
the
lower
court
and
i
think
the
discrimination
is
so
patent
that
that
alone
is
enough
to
be
decisive.
now,
there
is
some
literature
by
the
southern
regional
council
of
the
very
able
political
scientist
professor
of
tulane
university
that
this
statute
was
never
conceived
to
be
used
this
way.
that
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
identify
the
person
who
wanted
to
be
registered
and
show
how
long
he'd
live
in
a
particular
residence
and
whether
he
did
live
--
live
there
and
give
his
age
and
those
material
objective
standards
and
that
was
all,
but
is
being
misused
in
this
manner.
now,
that
hasn't
been
tried
out
though.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
gather
the
impression
that
they
were
not
that
they're
plainly
marked
--
that
they
have
to
say
whether
they're
negro
or
white.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
wouldn't
think
they'd
have
to
do
more
than
scan
it
and
see
whether
he's
a
negro
or
white.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
i
--
if
i
was
doing
it,
i
wouldn't
examine
the
whole
card
to
accomplish
that
objective.
i
would
just
examine
that
one
little
place
and
move
on.
that's
what
i'm
trying
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
gives
for
a
great
many
parishes
and
it
gives
the
--
the
registration.
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
anything
about
the
actual
voting
and
--
and
its
relations.
there
is
some
report
in
regard
to
that
in
the
civil
rights
commission.
but
whether
it
deals
with
the
difference
in
voting
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes.
it's
demonstrated
that
in
the
--
in
the
parishes
where
the
white
counsels
--
assistance
counsel
acted
to
try
to
purge
the
reduction
in
the
registration
of
negroes
was
very
great.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
they're
dealing
with
the
registration
and
it
shows
the
--
the
parishes
in
which
there
were
no
purges,
where
there
was
no
effort
to
challenge
and
remove
in
this
way
and
it
chose
the
comparison
and
it's
very
real
and
large.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
have
had
two
primaries.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
this
is
the
final
one
between
the
republican
and
democrat.
and
in
louisiana,
there
isn't
much
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
question
about
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
not
informed
about
that.
i
possibly
--
possibly
tell.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
to
my
knowledge,
there
is
no
local
election.
no
local
election
in
washington
parish.
it's
only
a
state
--
state
official.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
have
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
have
until
march
11th
as
i
computed,
to
file
any
notice
of
appeal.
so,
if
they
let
that
date
go
by,
the
election
we're
talking
about
is
april
19th,
then
they
--
they
won't
--
wouldn't
be
in
the
case
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
--
they
would
be
bound
by
the
judgment
below
anyway.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that's
a
problem
before
the
court
because
of
the
far
range
of
this
type
of
action
that
has
been
presented
in
this
case
and
the
effect
that
it
might
have
on
similar
action
in
the
future.
i
think
the
court
won't
have
to
consult
itself
and
determine
what's
the
best
way
to
handle
a
problem
of
that
seriousness,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
voting
process
and
how
much
it
means
to
us.
