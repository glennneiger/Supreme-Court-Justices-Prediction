justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
just
--
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
mr.
solicitor,
did
you
say
that
there
were
15,000
whites
on
the
voting
list?
justice
felix
frankfurter
11,000,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
do
you
happen
to
know
how
many
voted
at
the
last
election?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case,
i
was
just
curious.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
second
part
of
your
answer
to
justice
whittaker's
question
implied
another
way
of
answering
would
have
been
(inaudible)
decide
to
be
more
explicit,
if
you
can
disregards
what
you
have
said
with
the
state
court's
ruling
as
to
his
ministerial
duty,
is
that
incorrect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
just
--
i
just
want
to
know
if
that's
what
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
was
earlier
--
you
told
earlier
to
justice
whittaker
state
law
so
far
as
declared
by
decision
of
a
ruling
court
for
him,
if
there
were
no
federal
questions,
the
state
also
says,
he
has
a
--
he
has
a
ministerial
duty,
meaning
that
if
a
formality
is
satisfied,
he
must
act.
what
you're
saying
now,
what
--
what
your
answer
to
justice
whittaker
amount
to
is
in
the
context
that
was
you're
talking
about,
you
may
disregard
what
is
a
directing
decision
of
a
state
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
also
conceded
or
conceded
by
you
the
color
question
apart,
suppose
there
were
no
color
question,
that
the
registrar
could
not
sua
sponte
on
his
own
motion
throw
out
mrs.
louis's
registration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
any
question
of
differentiation
to
the
whites
and
colored
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
i
made
my
question
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose,
there
were
no
questions,
no
color
discrimination
there
and
suppose
that
mrs.
luis
had
made
--
had
made
an
entry
that
in
your
point
of
view
was
egregious
that
it
didn't
come
within
the
statute,
color
question,
color
discrimination
apart
in
your
view
would
the
registrar,
could
the
registrar
on
his
own
motive
find
her
--
her
registration
disqualifying
registration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wholly
apart
from,
i'm
not
talking
on
discrimination
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
-
under
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
would
the
registrar
know
whether
he
was
a
man
or
not
or
a
female,
even
though
they
might
be,
unless
it
might
--
unless
it
is
clear,
but
there
are
number
of
--
of
names
of
marian
or
adrian
or
vivian
that
do
not
disclose
whether
male
or
female.
justice
felix
frankfurter
her
name.
i
--
i'll
use
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
as
to
this
particular
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
general
rules
or
--
how
do
you
just
--
how
do
you
(inaudible)
herman
out
of
the
word
h.e.r.m.an.n.i.n.g.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
it
been
challenged
by
the
state,
if
i
may
speak
of
thomas
as
a
state
the
attorney
general
is
here
i
take
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
it
challenged
by
the
state
that
there
were
these
numerous,
identical
or
for
all
practical
purposes
are
identical
failures
in
spelling
or
in
addition
or
substraction
identification
in
white
registrations
as
against
colored,
is
that
challenged
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
apart
from
--
from
making
the
case
more
vivid
and
concrete,
you're
--
you're
not
addressing
yourself
to
something
has
been
in
issue,
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
your
--
your
argument
in
this
case,
and
i
just
want
to
know
whether
there's
any
context
on
what
you're
now
developing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
that
that
let's
you
know
your
position
and
i
know
that
the
counsel
want
to
present
the
case
to
you.
i
just
want
to
know
whether,
whether
the
basic,
the
underlying
factor
in
dispute
here
or
the
legal
consequence
or
merely
the
legal
consequences
and
the
obligation
of
state
official
etc.,
etc.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
--
did
they
find
the
points
on
this
which
they
were
hoping
or
on
which
they
began,
they
appealed
in
the
court
of
appeals?
there
was
some
doctrine
indicating
what
they
are
going
up
on,
wasn't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
appeal
is
to
question
and
determine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
have
they
taken
them
in
the
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
brief
challenge
some
other
findings
of
facts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
from
the
finding
of
fact,
was
justice
black's
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
it's
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
a
little
(inaudible)
minute
or
two
or
two
minutes,
in
some
of
the
seven
states
surely,
there
are
all
white
counties
(inaudible)
somewhere
in
all
black
county.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
don't
know
whether
that's
in
louisiana
or
not,
but
assume
an
all
white
county
in
louisiana,
assume
that,
and
the
rejection
for
the
striking
from
the
rolls
was
made
on
what
has
been
nominated
several
times
as
unconstitutional
criteria,
a
misspelling
of
--
of
one's
own
name
by
--
or
things
like
that
or
being
wrong
as
this
is
(inaudible)
by
a
day.
assume
an
white
county,
no
discrimination
but
white
vote
was
struck,
was
stricken,
names
of
the
white
vote
was
stricken
from
the
list.
would
there
be
any
--
is
there
any
constitutional
–
federal,
is
there
any
--
what
is
the
law
--
what
--
on
what
basis
if
the
government
or
anybody
else
go
in
challenge
state
law
and
say,
“you
deprive
me
of
my
right
to
vote
on
this
trivial
misspelling,”
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you'll
have
to
--
it
would
be
a
very
the
problem,
i
must
say
in
this
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
might
be
very
strict
in
its
demand
for
literacy.
as
of
the
present
congress
could,
tomorrow
this
afternoon
if
it
shows,
makes
its
own
specific
requirements
as
to
federal
--
as
to
the
federal
franchise,
but
until
it
has
done
so,
the
fact
that
the
state
is
very
strict
and
demands
a
high
rate
of
literacy
(inaudible),
i
should
think
you
would
have
a
very
different
case
that
if
you
came
here
on
that
mr.
solicitor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
do
solely,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you
answered
a
little
while
ago,
i
think
to
justice
whittaker,
if
the
same
test
of
a
--
of
a
failure
to
live
up
or
a
very
fastidious
standard
would
throw
out
the
10%
of
whites
and
50%
of
negroes,
you
also
got
a
different
problem
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
thinking
of
--
of
the
intrinsic
invalidity
of
a
very
high
in
my
point
of
view,
even
exquisite
standard
of
literacy
or
intelligence.
if
it
is
(inaudible)
done,
i
think
one
would
of
the
other
tough
job
saying
that's
the
deposition
of
your
federal
franchise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
assuming
--
assuming
invalid
or
unconstitutional
action,
what
cause
or
remedies
are
suggested
in
supposing
what
was
done
here
by
judge
wright?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
go
to
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
go
the
same
registrar
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
a
(inaudible)
answer
--
with
(inaudible)
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
there
are
no
--
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
new
test.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
failed
the
first
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
rulings
by
the
registrar,
are
they
defined
by
the
statute
if
they
got
to
have
a
--
a
colored
--
potential
colored
voter
must
have
colored
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
supporters?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
his
ruling?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
ask
you
to
turn
to
the
decree
of
the
court
because
after
all
that
--
that's
before
us
on
page
163
of
the
record
and
when
you
have
it,
i'd
like
to
put
a
question
to
you
if
i
may.
justice
felix
frankfurter
assume
--
assume
that
the
decree
only
subjected
or
that
the
decree
only
governed
or
controlled
the
action
as
to
taken
or
not
to
be
taken,
the
(inaudible)
with
paragraph
3
maybe
in
(c)
of
3
and
paragraph
4,
paragraph
1
and
2
implicates
other
people
and
paragraph
5
my
hasty
reading
of
the
(inaudible)
also
may
raise
an
question,
but
three
and
four,
the
record
exclusively
(inaudible)
thomas.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
the
decree
only
was
to
carry
out
paragraphs
3
(a)
and
(b),
and
(c),
and
four,
would
that
abort
what
was
sought
by
this
suit?
would
that
intimate
what
you're
asking?
if
you
just
had
that
to
be
enforced
and
if
that
was
respected
for
curtis
and
thomas,
which
i
assume
you
would
--
would
obey
(inaudible)
told
you
ultimately
what
judge
wright's
decree,
would
that
effectuate,
what
the
suit
is
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
the
first
place,
this
1377
are
now
--
those
would
be
dealt,
wouldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
the
future,
there
might
hypothetically
be
raised
the
question
that
you
raise,
but
i
should
doubt
it
in
obedience
for
the
decree.
i
mean
people
would
--
any
good
lawyer
would
say
you're
awful
chance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that
right
as
far
as
contempt
if
you
disobey
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
(inaudible)
his
agent
and
his
successor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
attorney
general
appear
for
the
other
defendants?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
the
--
not
the
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
see
if
i
understand
you
mr.
attorney
general,
otherwise
--
well,
otherwise
qualified,
it
can't
mean
can
it
that
the
state
court
may
disqualify
them
and
therefore,
there's
a
state
determine
this
qualification
and
therefore
they're
not
citizens
or
otherwise
qualified.
justice
felix
frankfurter
otherwise,
that
would
really
--
could
notify
obviously
very
simply,
federal
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
the
very
--
the
very
issue
of
whether
or
not,
this
is
all
argumentative
(inaudible)
is
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
claim
is
that
the
disqualification
itself
is
a
violation
of
federal
law,
then
that
can't
be
determined
by
the
state
court
so
as
to
prevent
it
being
examined
in
the
federal
court
that
to
be
--
has
to
be
attorney
general
under
1957
act,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
would.
i
think
that
this
mean
that
they
must
be
21
rather
than
19
contentions
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
think
like
that.
that
there
is
not,
in
other
words,
were
otherwise
meaning
on
matters
not
in
dispute
to
entitle
and
to
vote,
but
as
to
the
matter
that
is
in
dispute,
on
the
claim
of
federal
supremacy
it
doesn't
mean
to
see
how
that
is
to
be
state
determined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
need
by
ask
some
questions
in
order
to
bring
out
the
fact
of
the
whole
electoral
process
down
there
that
is
as
i
understand
it.
as
i
understand
from
the
decree
of
judge
rice
3
(b)
he
says
there,
he
must
permit
the
names
to
remain
all
for
present
and
current
roles
or
qualified
voters.
that
means
they're
off
the
rolls.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
the
relation
between
being
off
the
rolls
and
having
the
right
to
vote?
can
you
vote
if
you're
off
the
rolls?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
not.
after
they've
been
put
off
the
rolls
which
is
indispensable
to
the
exercise
to
the
franchise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
justice
black
has
indicated,
the
--
the
findings
of
facts
are
that
they
are
off
the
roll
because
they
were
taken
off
and
they
were
taken
off
because
of
they
were
colored.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
isn't
that
judge
wright
found?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
and
the
--
and
the
--
they
didn't
respond
to
the
challenges
issued
because
from
their
point
of
view,
a
colored
man
who
did
this
doesn't
--
doesn't
qualify
whereas
a
white
man
does
and
that's
what
i
call
discrimination
if
it's
true.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
you
are
really
addressing
yourself.
you
don't
stop
as
justice
black
started
in
this
question,
namely
there
were
findings
of
the
facts
that
they
were
taken
off
the
rolls,
because
they
were
colored
people
although
the
reason
given
was,
that
they
didn't
spell
the
name
right
or
put
an
extra
i
or
didn't
cross
the
thing,
but
you
say
that
you
don't
accept
those
findings
as
the
starting
point
for
legal
discussion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
--
to
refuse
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
knew
how
to
spell
louisiana
if
your
registrar
in
--
in
one
of
these
counsels
on
these
parishes
himself
spells
it
correctly
and
he
looks
at
the
--at
the
--
he
looks
at
the
registration
and
see
that
was
spelled
incorrectly,
it
has
extra
n
now
what
not.
do
i
understand
you
when
you
say
that
that's
sustained
of
challenge
because
automatically
louisiana
is
misspelled
and
it
was
challenged
because
he
misspelled
and
therefore
you'll
remove
them
from
the
roll,
is
that
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
and
even
in
his
spelling,
you
said
--
i'm
asking
i
am
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
--
does
it
challenged
because
of
a
misspelling.
louisiana
is
misspelled
as
we've
seen
it
and
if
--
if
the
challenge
is
to
the
correctness
of
the
spelling
and
the
registrar
in
good
conscience
and
simply
reading
says,
yes
it
is
misspelled.
is
he
under
duty
to
sustain
that
challenge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
a
man
i
am
told.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
--
i
thought
i
understood
you
--
i
thought
i
understood
you
when
you
said
that
if
a
challenge
is
made
to
a
fellow
who
is
on
the
rolls,
on
the
ground
that
he
doesn't
need
a
literacy
test
and
the
registrar
finds
that
in
fact,
the
--
the
challenged
voter
has
misspelled.
i
thought
i
understood
you
but
you
said,
if
he's
performing
his
duty
he
must
accept
that
challenge
as
sustained.
did
i
misunderstand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
asking
you
what
your
conception
is
under
the
law
of
the
duty
of
the
registrar
not
whether
he
wants
to
wink
an
eye
but
--
but
does
he
under
the
law
may
do
what
judge
--
justice
black
suggested?
the
fellow
has
made
eight
misspellings
but
the
registrar
knows
him,
he
make
a
good
citizen
and
he's
an
honorable
man
and
all
the
rest,
has
he
--
that
much
leeway
to
decide
whether
it
comes
within
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you're
right
about
that,
then
it's
repeating
the
thing
over
--
did
i
understood
you
a
little
while
ago?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
take
the
--
take
the
exhibit
if
the
government
(inaudible)
his
brief

if

well
that's
a

that's
an
arithmetic
calculation,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
and
so,
no
affidavit
as
justice
whittaker
suggested
could
--
could
change
that
correct
challenge
if
that
would
be
a
correct
challenge,
could
it?
justice

but
just
as
you
give
(inaudible)
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
calculate
erroneously
and
say
that
the
division
as
to
arithmetic
was
carried.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
but
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wouldn't
the
correctness
or
error
of
his
claim
be
something
to
be
verified
or
discredited
by
just
looking
at
the
dates
he
gives.
justice

if
that

is
sustained
age
not

all
sorts
people
make
mistakes,
i
believe
half
of
the

make

justice

does
the

(voice

--
justice

assume
--
assume
that
as
to
everything
else
from
the
case,
you
start
from
their
names
that
the
finding
is
not
overturned
that
they
were
stricken
off
the
road
because
of
color
and
the
only
thing
that
they
would
then
you
confront
in
opinion

attorney
general
namely,
that
the
--
only
the
--
only
the
registrar
before
the
court
and
not
these
private
individuals.
do
you
find
any
embarrassment,
any
difficulty
in
sustaining
paragraphs
3
and
4
of
the
decree?
could
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
commerce
not
be
subjected
to
what
judge
wright
their
decree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
don't
know,
but
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
question
whether
the
absence
of
the
council
people
makes
the
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
assume
you're
right
about
that.
assume
couldn't
the
proceeding
have
been
began
merely
against
thomas?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
asked
on
that.
i
mean,
he
is
the
only
follow
who
really
controls
whether
the
name
should
stay
on
or
be
stricken
from
the
roll,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he's
decreed
in
three
and
four
to
disregard
these
challenges
by
other
people
to
be
sure
but
disregard
them
and
restore
their
names
to
the
roll.
now,
is
there
any
impediment
to
this
caring
out
that
direction
or
decree
of
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'll
take
your
word
for
that,
a
hundred
and
whatever
it
is,
but
3
(a)
says,
he
--
he's
enjoined
from
giving
any
legal
effect
to
the
approximately
fake
challenges
while
in
the
office.
now,
he
could
carry
that
out
without
any
unimpeded
by
the
absence
of
the
--
of
the
--
what
do
you
call
consider
these
council,
couldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--i'm
--
no.
i'm
now
speaking
merely
to
the
point
of
the
absence
of
the
citizen's
counsel.
forget
about
louisiana
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
forget
everything
else.
the
fact
that
the
citizen's
counsel
is
not
before
this
court,
is
unrelated
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
power
of
the
court
to
arrest
thomas
to
carry
out
3
(a),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
equally
it's
on
3
(b).
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
can't
go
any
further
from
the
specific
term
of
judge
wright's
language,
can
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
for
reasons
other
than
the
absence
of
the
city
counsil,
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
you
referred
to
and
that's
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
could
readily
turn
to
the
actual
statement
of
the
registrar,
the
question
and
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
(inaudible)
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
relevance
you
have
in
concern
to
our
problem,
would
make
40%
of
47%
or
55%.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
–
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
apart
from
this
litigation,
is
there
any
authority
--
who
has
authority
if
anybody
has,
the
attorney
general
to
initiate
purging
the
rolls
of
improper
registrants?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anybody?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
involve,
that--
all
have
to
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
merely
says
that
the
motion
must
derived
from
a
citizen
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
registrar
himself.
so,
that
--
so
that
if
there
are
--
if
these
improper
--
if
these
1300
--
1300
colored
people
who
were
improperly
who
were
stricken
but
improperly
stricken
because
the
same
impediment,
the
same
disqualification
related
to
white
voters
who
remained
on
the
roll
if
they
were
restored,
the
registrar
could
take
both
colored
and
white
off,
couldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
provided
he
operated
with
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
restoring
this
--
the
illegal
as
you
claim,
there
would
be
illegal
voter
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
merely
mean,
that
he
would
have
to
protect
these
off
but
also
take
the
whites
off
in
equal
measure,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
could
be
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
state
isn't
impudent,
it
doesn't
have
to
wait
if
some
private
citizen
begins
to
move
against
particular
people,
is
that's
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
don't
belong
there,
but
they
are
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
but
if
--
if
10
white
folks
and
10
colored
folks
are
improperly
--
allegedly,
did
not
comply
with
the
test
called
the
literacy
test,
in
--
as
an
object
of
fact,
the
10
white
folks
stay
on
the
roll
despite
that
fact,
but
then
colored
folks
don't,
then,
whatever
the
reason,
there
is
a
clear
differentiation
between
white
and
colored.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
demonstration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
many
things
in
the
law
you
can
demonstrate,
but
this
--
this
is
one
of
them.we
call
that
arithmetic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
he's
perfect.
he
satisfies
all
the
requirements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
does
your
argument
start
with
accepting
the
testimony
of
the
registrar
that
50%
of
the
white
(inaudible)
were
subject
to
the
same
infirmity
as
these
colored
people
were
struck
off
the
roll?do
you
start
with
that
accepting
that
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you've
got
the
objective
fact
that
there
is
a
--
that
there
is
a
striking
off
from
a
list,
1000
--
1377
was
keeping
on
whatever
the
hundreds
are
and
the
difference
is
within
black
and
white.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
the
--
in
the
jury
cases
that
we've
had,
that
is
the
fact.
that
is
the
result
of
the
operation
of
a
state
law,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
and
if
that's
the
fact
--
if
that's
the
mathematical
or
an
arithmetic
fact,
then
this
--
and
this
state
machinery
that
brings
about
that
fact,
we've
held
in
the
jury
cases
that
if
that
happens,
it
can't
be
accident.
accidents
don't
happen,
six
of
them
--
seven
--
six
of
them
--
seven
and
11
aren't
(inaudible)
all
the
time.
they
sometimes
happen
but
not
all
the
time.
and
therefore,
if
that
happens,
the
state
has
brought
about
a
result
not
to
an
act
accorded
as
we
lawyers
say,
but
some
human
operation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
the
state's
operation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
must
--
they
must
observe
them
not
on
paper,
but
in
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
use
of
saying
--
no
use
of
giving
me
a
million
dollars
on
paper,
if
i
can't
cash
it
in
for
$5,
you
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we've
got
a
case
here
on
a
record
and
we're
limited
--
bound
by
that
record
and
on
that
record,
certain
findings
were
made.
and
the
finding
is
an
arithmetic
differentiation
on
the
basis
of
color.
you
say
you
start
with
accepting
that.
now,
how
that
was
brought
about
is
beside
the
point.
the
question
is
whether
it
should
be
allowed
to
continue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
what
he
wants.
that
isn't
the
way
i
read
his
findings.
what
he
said
is
you
can't
throw
these
people
off
because
you're
keeping
people
on
who
have
--
who
were
exactly
subject
to
those
infirmities
with
one
exception
that
they're
white
and
not
colored?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
i
can't
decide
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
our
fact
of
discrimination
by
saying,
two
rights
don't
make
a
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
wrong
to
discriminate
on
color.
and
that's
what
the
state
of
louisiana,
on
this
record,
had
been
found
to
have
been
--
to
have
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
it
came
about
is
immaterial.
there
is
an
existing
discrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
discrimination
is
rooted
entirely
on
color.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
was
there
any
profit
made
by
the
state?
i
call
the
registrar
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
--
and
it
was
in
--
in
defense
or
in
answer
to
this
complaint.
did
the
state
come
forward
and
say
our
rolls
are
full
of
people
who
ought
to
be
there
and
will
the
court
give
us
a
recess
of
a
week
or
two
weeks
so
that
we
can
clear
the
whole
rolls
white
and
colored.
was
any
such
offer
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
your
--
your
associate
to
say
that
the
registrar
can
--
on
his
own
motion
forge
the
roll
of
--
or
did
i
misunderstand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
roberts,
i
have
a
--
i
have
a
difficulty
different
from
those
about
which
you
questioned
as
to
the
interpretation,
the
exact
scope
of
the
requirements
of
louisiana
law
for
qualification
of
voters.
my
problem
is
the
--
it's
quite
a
different
one,
namely,
it
is
this,
these
records
are
in
the
keeping
of
the
registrar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
order
to
make
affidavits,
you've
got
to
see
their
registration
record,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
is
in
control
of
them.
now,
under
your
statute,
people
may
make
affidavits
challenging
both,
but
in
order
to
be
able
to
make
those
challenges,
they
have
to
ask
the
registrar
for
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thus
far
you're
with
me,
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
people
who
ask
for
--
who
ask
for
the
records
to
make
the
basis
for
challenges
as
for
1377
records
of
negroes
and
only
of
10
whites,
when
in
fact,
there
were
11,444
white
persons
on
the
rolls
and
only
1517
negroes.
so
that,
the
registrar's
an
indispensable
--
as
an
indispensable
participant
in
the
action
of
these
citizens
who
have
wanted
to
challenge,
exceeded
to
a
request
of
1377
records
of
1517
negroes
and
exceeded
to
a
request
of
only
10
for
11,000
whites.
now,
that
for
me
is
exactly
like
the
cases
we've
had
as
the
juries,
where
the
mathematical
result
could
not
be
brought
about
by
any
--
i
hesitate,
i
was
about
to
say
honest,
by
any
undiscriminatory
action
on
the
data.
they
must've
been
discriminatory,
if
out
of
15,000
--
out
of
11,000,
you
look
at
only
10.
and
out
of
1500,
you
look
for
1300
or
nearly
1400
to
find
out
whether
there
is
misspelling.
then,
in
the
inevitable
objective
nature
of
things,
you
will
call
out
unfairly
as
against
the
1300
out
of
the
1500.
in
new
york,
was
the
1300
out
of
the
1500,
as
against
10
out
of
11,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
to
me
is
an
arithmetic
demonstration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
right
found
that
they
didn't
search
the
record
and
purposefully
to
his
knowledge,
could
not
have
searched
the
record
of
the
11
--
of
the
11,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
they
took
out
of
11,000,
they
took
10
and
that
satisfied
them.
out
of
the
1500,
they
took
13
and
the
result
is
what
you
would
expect
that
they
found
this
overwhelming
percentage
of
--
of
misspellings
or
omission
out
of
13
--
out
of
1500
and
actually,
if
you
only
took
10
out
of
the
11,000,
they
wouldn't
find
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
roberts,
the
chief
justice
of
this
court
said
that
because
we
are
judges
and
therefore,
to
a
large
extent
naive,
we
mustn't
be
blind
to
what
everybody
else
knows.
this
registrar
came
out
of
an
environment
in
which
the
desire
not
to
have
negroes
vote
is
not
a
fair
--
unfair
attribution
to
make
here
and
in
the
environment
in
which
he
lives.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
before
--
was
all
these
before
judge
wright?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
that
i
must
take
judicial
notice
of
every
fact
or
figure
that's
been
an
official
document,
because
it
isn't
an
official
document.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
many
ex
parte
statements
get
into
official
documents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
take
judicial
notice
of
--
of
unquestioned
history.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
your
brief
for
--
does
the
civil
rights
commission's
report
set
forth
the
--
give
statistics
on
the
voting
for
a
period
for
about
five
years
or
so
as
in
white
and
colored
in
louisiana
for
the
whole
state,
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
there
a
great
discrepancy
between
colored
registrants
and
colored
voters?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
don't
--
i'm
ignorant
but,
it
may
well
be.
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
that
in
the
number
of
the
southern
states,
the
--
the
effective
voting
is
the
primary
reason
not
in
the
final
election,
that's
true
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
that
--
so
that
would
have
to
be
taken
into
account
because
it
must
be
a
falling
off
between
potential
voters
and
actual
votes
cast
at
the
general
election.
