what
--
what
was
his
defect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
have
10
minutes
to
--
additional
to
respond
and
the
counsel
may
have
10
minutes
additional
also
if
you
wish
upon
your
time.
mr.
cousins
--
do
i
--
do
i
--
pronounce
it
correctly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
misunderstood
the
attorney
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
cousins,
may
i
--
may
i
put
it
in
just
little
--
little
different
way.
if
the
challenge
is
made,
is
it
anything
more
than
a
mere
ministerial
duty
on
the
part
of
the
registrar
to
remove
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
a
ministerial
duty
of
his
to
then
remove
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cousins,
that
little
--
little
troubled
by
this
affidavit
of
affoway
smiths
and
that
it
was
--
she
was
taken
out
the
road
because
she
made
a
mistake
to
say
in
her
age.
what
was
the
mistake?
how
much
of
the
mistake
did
she
made?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it's
on
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it's
on
page
42(a).
it's
one
of
this
--
it's
one
of
these
in
the
government's
brief,
the
first
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
day
error
out
of
70
year
there's
70
years
and
that
--
that
you
take
her
off
rolls
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
you
take
her
out
for
the
rolls
court.
chief
justice

warren
(voice

--
your
state
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
could
see
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cousins,
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
laying
the
challenges
aside
for
the
moment,
laying
the
challenges
completely
aside,
does
the
registrar
have
either
the
right
or
the
duty
to
purge
the
rolls
voters
who
have
made
mistakes
for
which
they
might
be
challenged
in
the
manner
they
were
challenged
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he's
supposed
to
keep
them
up
to
date
all
the
time?
and
--
and
to
remover
any
that
he
--
that
he
knows
or
almost
arose
illegally.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
thing
was
going
through
my
mind
was
this.
if
having
the
--
the
duty
to
remove
from
the
rolls,
people
who
were
not
legally
registered,
he
sat
by
and
did
nothing
at
that
kind
knowing
as
he
said
here
that
50%
of
the
white
people
were
subject
to
the
same
infirmities
that
these
colored
people
were
subject
to
and
then
he
left
the
white
councils
come
in
and
make
affidavit
to
challenging
98%
or
whatever
it
was,
or
85%
of
all
the
--
all
the
colored
voters
and
he
did
nothing
about
the
50%
of
the
11,000
white
voters
who
were
in
exactly
the
same
position.
isn't
that
in
itself
a
state
discrimination?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
he
took
off
for
any
reason
whether
through
his
--
through
his
own
responsibility,
his
own
duty,
or
whether
through
challenges
that
he
took
off
them
off
rolls
85%
of
all
the
negroes
were
registered
and
left
on
--
on
the
rolls,
50%
of
the
--
of
the
white
voters
knowing
that
they
have
the
same
infirmities
where
it
was
his
duty
to
take
them
off,
wouldn't
that
in
itself
be
discrimination
by
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
have
there
any
--
is
there
any
parish
in
the
state
where
they
have
taken
off
vast
numbers
of
white
voters?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
what
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

--
and
i
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
is
one
thing
if
a
man
moves
out
of
the
district,
it's
a
one
--
one
thing
if
he's
dead.
it's
another
thing
--
another
thing
if
he
--
if
he
does
something
else,
if
he's
convicted
of
crime
perhaps
but
for
things
of
this
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
roberts,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
mr.
--
mr.
justice
black
was
trying
to
get
an
answer
to
it
yesterday,
i
thought,
and
it's
this.
are
you
--
are
you
saying
to
us
now
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
findings
of
judge
wright
or
--
are
you
saying
to
us
that
the
findings
of
judge
wright
are
not
sufficient
to
support
the
position
of
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
then
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that
you
do
challenge
the
validity
of
his
findings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
not
the
fact
that
these
findings
do
not
support
the
position
of
the
government
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
didn't
--
suppose
he
didn't
cross
a
t
or
dot
an
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
they
challenged
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
he
--
would
he
have
to
go
off
because
that's
a
mistake
in
--
in
writing,
i
suppose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
didn't
leave
at
all.
he
wouldn't
--
he
couldn't
traverse
it
because
he
didn't
leave
at
all.
suppose
that
--
suppose
that
the
--
the
challenge
was
true
that
he
left
--
that
he
failed
to
cross
one
t
on
his
application
or
--
or
he
failed
to
dot
one
i,
and
the
challenge
was
made
on
that
grounds,
would
he
have
to
throw
him
off?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
you
said
that
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
i
think
that's
all.
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
