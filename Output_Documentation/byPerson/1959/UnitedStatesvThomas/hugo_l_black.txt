justice

black
who
encircled
the
mr.?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
the
findings
challenged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
conclusions,
the
finding
of
the
facts
challenge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
was
finding,
wasn't
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
say
the
findings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
challenge
to
any
particular
part
of
those
findings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
not
accepted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
seen
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
we
found
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
considering
it
do
we
have
before
us
a
permanent
injunction
or
an
interlocutory
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
permanent
injunction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
your
entire
argument
was
based
on
the
fact
it
is
discriminating
here
on
the
basis
of
color?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
case
is
based
in
the
findings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
get
back
to
as
i
understand
your
problem
which
is
you
have
finding,
saying
this
was
done
on
the
acaccount
of
color
and
--
and
there
is
no
challenge
to
it,
but
as
i
understand
those
findings
that
i
see,
that
as
i
understand
it
you
open
this
evidence
to
show
that
they're
supported
--
argument
showed
that
they're
supported
by
evidence?
do
they
claim
they're
not
supported
by
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
challenge
the
findings
in
the
court
after
they
were
made
to
the
district
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
file
one
brief
or
two?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
wondering
also
if
it
wouldn't
come
under
80
u.s.
code,
241
conspiracy
no
more
question
for
anything
(inaudible)
so
forth
and
it
doesn't
pre
exercise
the
enjoyment
of
the
right
which
been
held
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
most
of
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
--
who
used
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
not
the
state
officers,
were
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
so,
why
do
you
talk
about
the
state
action
(inaudible)
these
private
individuals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
have
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
know
what
panoply
means.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
when
you
say
that
a
person
is
not
a
state
officer
and
the
state
is
not
to
do
it,
but
i
don't
quite
understand
your
panoply.
justice
hugo
l.
black
private
--private
person.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
you're
saying
in
--
isn't
it
that
if
a
private
persons
joined
with
somebody
else
to
take
away
these
rights,
these
private
persons
are
allowed
whether
they
are
acting
for
the
state
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
construe
the
decree
as
being
only
an
interlocutory
one
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
all
it
does?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
all
the
fifteenth
amendment
does?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
language
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
say
that's
what
it
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
mean
the
last
clause
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
last
clause
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
last
clause
of
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
this
connection?
i
--
i'm
interested
in
your
discussion.
it
seems
to
me
like
your
problem
here
is
this.
the
supreme
law
as
you
said
that
you
cannot
do
this
on
the
account
of
color.
you
had
a
finding
that
it
was
done
on
the
acaccount
of
color.
so,
you
don't
claim
that
the
state
can
bar
him
on
the
acaccount
of
color,
these
people
on
a
acaccount
of
color
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
cannot
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
can
get
down,
do
you
not
to
the
question
of
whether
the
finding
was
right
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
but
not
whether
he's
qualified,
but
whether
he's
--
whether
you
have
put
him
out
of
voting
because
of
his
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
were
all
these
others
have
much
to
do
with
it
because
the
sole
issue
here,
have
they
been
put
off
because
of
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
does
it
make
about
why
it
was
done?
the
issue
here
is,
under
the
findings
that
i
see,
solely
whether
these
people
have
been
barred
from
voting
in
the
state
of
louisiana
on
a
account
of
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
the
registrar
did
it,
that's
the
state,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
don't
have
a
mandatory
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
doesn't
have
a
mandatory
duty,
does
it,
if
--
if
it's
on
the
account
of
color?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
the
state
allow
him
to
say
that
it's
mandatory
on
you
to
remove
this
man
because
of
color?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
do
not
file
to
get
back
to
the
one
issue
that
you
have
to
meet?
i
don't
see
you
can
meet
it.
have
they
--
does
the
record
show
that
these
people,
the
findings
that
were
made
that
there
were
barred
on
account
of
color
is
supported
by
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
she
spell
it,
i'm
curious.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
has
a
description
doesn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
may
not?
i
thought
all
the
registrars
in
the
southern
states
have
a
wide
discretion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
the
man
can
vote.
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we're
talking
about
the
same
thing
--
we
are
talking
about
the
same
thing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
knew
the
man,
known
him
many
years
and
he
was
a
fine,
high
class,
good
citizen,
wasn't
well
educated
but
he's
a
good
citizen,
everybody
liked
him.
you
say
that
he
would
have
to
remove
him
from
the
roll,
because
he's
misspelled
the
words?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
law
of
louisiana?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
law
of
louisiana?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
was
challenge
because
he
misspelled
one
word.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
this
gentleman
named
mr.
herman
somebody?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
herman
is
a
man,
did
you
look
at
his?
did
--
was
it
right
to
let
him
vote?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it
be
in
the
discretion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
right.
you
submit,
it's
always
this
way
i
think
i
know
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
law
which
gave
the
registrar
the
very
wide
broad
discretion
looking
at
the
man,
looking
at
his
education
and
knowing
his
--
his
standing
in
the
community
and
so
forth
to
take
him
or
not
him
as
he
saw
fit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
one
other
answer
is
that
he
must
not
misspell
a
single
word.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
misspelled
six
words,
he's
a
good
citizen,
everybody
knows
it,
a
good
man
in
the
community,
high
standard,
he's
a
reputable
man,
is
it
your
idea
that
a
registrar
has
to
remove
him
from
the
roll?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
(inaudible)
on
it's
face
it's
wrong
does
it,
mathematically
speaking.
if
--if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
does,
how
could
he
get
three
people
to
come
up
in
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
have
registrars
in
louisiana
who
would
take
that
direction
and
say,
“well,
we
were
wrong
and
collected.”
stating
it
corrected
first,
we
have
three
witnesses
who
said
that's
right
we
accept
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
figuring
it
out
for
us
and
let's
us
know
how
much
you
saw?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
i'm
talking
about
the
date
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
see.
i
--
i
have
definition
in
the
government,
i
might
figure
--
i
might
figure
it
out
when
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
no,
no.
i
--
i
just
don't
quite
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
day?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
she
responded
if
she
made
a
day's
mistake,
i
think
she
denied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
cause
have
to
be
forgiven
from
the
--
the
one
day
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you're
telling
us
that
this
woman
would
have
no
trouble
if
she
could
go
back
there
right
now
and
tell
him
she's
wrong
and
get
registered
tomorrow.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
way
mr.
cousins,
was
she
one
day
older
and
one
day
younger
than
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
she
should
had
been
one
day
older?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
referring
me
to
the
precise
language
of
your
louisiana
statute
which
imposes
an
absolute
and
(inaudible)
registrar
as
to
abate
under
the
law
to
remove
a
person
from
the
roll,
who
makes
a

day
mistake
in
calculating
the
number
of
days
he
has
lived.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo

(voice

part
of
the
statute
on
which
you
rely
about
saying
that
he
has
no
discretion
in
the
case
of
that
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
you
to
tell
us
that
this
is
merely
political
pride
to
take
the
voters
off
against
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
it
was.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
since
this
case
was
tried,
the
only
--
the
only
one
other
question,
since
this
case
was
tried,
it
is
developed
the
50%
of
the
white
voters
are
wrongfully
on
the
ballot,
has
your
registrar
removed
any
those
50
percent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
going
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
you
do
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
on
--
on
that?
suppose
a
man
is
born
in
1910
and
he
registered
in
1958
and
he
puts
on
his
registration
that
he
is
65-year-old.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
made
a
mistake.
can
he
then
excuse
that
by
getting
three
people
to
swear
that
he
was
65
even
though
he
is
really
58?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
can
do
that.
in
other
words,
the
registrar
has
to
take
the
word
of
these
three
witnesses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
from
1910
to
1958
is
69
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
--
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out.
i
thought
you
were
saying
that,
that
if
they
made
a
mistake
in
calculation,
they
can
get
somebody
to
come
and
swear
that
it
was
a
mistake
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
your
registrar?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
he
vote?[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
in
--
you're
going
--
you'd
better
subject
us
to
a
spelling
counterattack.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
taking
the
position
in
that
several
times,
but
i
--
i
want
to
be
sure
that
will
see
you.
i
can't
quite
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
you
are.
i
did
not
know
that
there
was
any
statement
used
in
providing
for
determining
the
character,
the
merits,
the
literacy
of
its
people
as
voters,
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not,
they
could
spell
a
word.
i
--
i
must
say
that
i
have
grave
doubts
and
you
say
that
that
is
the
law.
or
the
--
which
is
operating
in
that
way
and
of
course,
that
would
explain
how
you
can
get
so
many
one
color
on
and
not
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
injunction
outstanding
that
requires
this
registrar
to
register
these
white
people
that
usually
are
disqualified
because
they
spell
words
wrongly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
didn't
he
disqualify
them?
why
--
why
do
you
say
that
he
put
the
other
wrong,
because
he
was
afraid
not
to?
he
wasn't
afraid
--
he
wasn't
afraid
to
take
the
white
people
--
the
white
folk,
was
it?
justice

black
was
he
afraid
to
keep
them
off
under
--
justice

black
--
any
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
--
justice
hugo

black
i
understand
that's
your
contention,
if
it's
a
bona
fide
effort
--
if
it's
a
bona
fide
law,
if
you're
stating
bona
fide,
saying,
the
states.
but
if
it's
a
mere
--
as
we
tell
that
justice
frankfurter
calls
your
attention,
would
that
make
any
difference
how
ingenious
it
may
be
if
the
purpose
in
the
end
works
out
to
exclude
people
on
account
of
their
color.
justice

as
you
know,
there
was

actually
one
in
louisiana.

well,
you
can't
do
that.
and
i
--
i
cannot
--
do
i
understand
you
seriously
to
tell
the

as
representing
the
state
of
louisiana
that
you
have
a
roll
under
which
the
contempt
of
registrar

his
contempt,
it's
a
duty
declined
to
register
and
you
say
they
disqualified.

failed
to
spell

correctly.
justice

you
keep

you
keep
basing
it
on
that
premise.
justice
hugo

black
but
they
disqualify.
justice

black
and
that
he
has
to
do
it.
do
i
understand
you
seriously
to
say
or
the
state
of
louisiana
that
that's
the
law
of
louisiana?
justice
hugo

black
i'm
asking
you
if
you
tell
us
seriously.
justice
hugo

do
you
believe
that
the
law
of
louisiana
that
citizens
who
have
good
character,
fine
character,
good
morals,
good
religious
view,
good
citizens,
patriotic,
who
can't
simply
can't
spell
a
word
correctly,
that
under
the
law
of
louisiana,
a
white
man
can
be
deprived
of
his
right
to
vote?
justice

black
i
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
government.
do
you
--
i
want
to
know
if
you
are
telling
us
and
urging
us
seriously
to
accept
the
law
of
louisiana
to
decide
this
case
on
that
basis,
that
was
an
ironclad
law
which
compelled
the
registrar
whether
he
wants
to
or
not,
to
decline
--
to
put
on
the
good
citizens
because
they
misspell
a
word
or
make
a
miscalculation
of
a
date.
justice

well,
i
say,
in
his
opinion,
that's
(voice

justice

black
that
means
in
his
discretion.
justice

do
what?

you
say,
he'd
have

suppose
it
was
the
