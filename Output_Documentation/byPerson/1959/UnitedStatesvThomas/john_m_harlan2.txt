justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me?
under
this
state
procedure
does
the
mere
submission
of
the
affidavit
result
in
removal
or
is
some
determination
statement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
proof
in
the
record
that
mrs.
luis
is
a
registration
had
been
under
scrutiny?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
all
i
was
wondering
was
the
discrepancies
which
you
point
out
here
whether
they
were
--
whether
the
record
shows
that
they
--
were
might
have
been
occasioned
by
overlooking
each
particular
registrations
or
whether
--
how
these
registrations
were
looked
over
and
--
but
not
challenged.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
a
little
confused
to
what
you
said
to
justice
black.
i
thought
this
was
a
preliminary
injunction
as
it's
described
in
your
brief
rather
than
a
permanent
one,
but
if
you
look
at
the
injunction,
it
has
all
the
earmarks
of
being
permanent,
which
is
the
fact?
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
there's
a
temporary
injunction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
from
your
point
of
view,
i
should
think
you'd
like
to
have
a
temporary
injunction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
was
going
to
say
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
the
defendant's
duty,
the
registrar's
duty
as
measured
by
the
state
supreme
--
by
the
state
law
is
what
this
court
said
it
was
his
duty,
that's
how
we
have
to
take
the
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
a
state
law
duty
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
duty.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
we
don't
have
to
worry
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
how
we
read
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
talking
about
the
state
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
there
are
only
200
left
anyway
i
think.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
of
these
people.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
i
--
i'm
sorry.
i
would
try
to
just
to
come
back
to
the
question
put
by
justice
black.
you
start
here
with
the
findings
of
the
district
court
that
these
people
were
excluded
solely
on
the
ground
of
color.
that's
what
the
district
court
found.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
the
evidence
doesn't
support
it.
therefore,
we
should
overturn
the
finding.
supposing
we
disagree
with
you
on
that
and
to
say
that
we
cannot
overturn
that
finding
because
there
is
sufficient
evidence
that
it
is
supported.
where
do
you
go
from
there
in
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
your
case,
isn't
it?
i
mean
that's
--
that's
the
essence
of
this
case
leaving
out
of
all
this
discussion
about
what
the
registrar
can
do
and
can't
do,
you
start
with
findings
of
the
district
court,
these
people
were
discriminated
against
on
account
of
color
and
only
color
and
you
either
have
to
persuade
us
to
overturn
those
findings
or
you'll
have
to
show
us
why
if
we
have
accept
the
findings
notwithstanding
that
the
district
court
ought
to
be
reversed.
that's
the
whole
case,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
district
court
judge
wright
did
not
concern
himself
as
to
whether
the
particular
challenges
were
good
or
bad
or
whether
the
district
--
whether
the
registrar
did
or
didn't
have
jurisdiction
that
all
he
found
was
that
whenever
the
state
law,
it's
application
had
not
been
applied
equally
to
negroes
and
whites.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
he
whole
thing
he
found.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
we're
not
really
concern
with
anything
except
the
sufficiency
of
discriminatory
application.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
he
also
--
but
he
also
testified
did
he
not,
that
even
though
there
were
only
10
challenges
to
white
persons,
he,
the
registrar
knew
that
50%
of
the
registrations
of
white
persons
had
the
same
character
of
infirmity
under
state
law
as
the
10
challenges
exhibited.
