mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
--
and
the
associate
justice
if
could
take
just
a
little
bit
of
a
time
to
see
if
i
could
explain
exactly
the
situation
we
have
here
to
see
if
i
can
bring
this
article
245
into
focus
as
to
exactly
how
did
they
use
in
this
instance.
for
instance,
under
the
louisiana
registration
system,
the
talk
today
on
245
is
a
challenging
system
opposed
to
the
fact
that
these
registered
voters
at
one
time
had
been
a
member
of
voting
society
because
they
were
illegally
placed
upon
the
rolls.
now
reason
why
we
say
that
is
that
under
the
constitution
of
louisiana,
we
have
a
specific
requirement
as
to
be
a
registered
voter.
the
constitution
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief
says,
that
you
must
be
at
least
21,
you
must
live
in
the
state
of
louisiana
or
locale
for
certain
amount
of
time
and
more
importantly,
you
must
be
a
registered
voter.
now,
by
being
a
registered
voter,
you
must
obey
the
requirements
set
out
is
both
the
constitution
and
in
the
legislative
acts.
now,
as
this
situation
is
presently
developed,
what
has
happen
here
in
washington
parish
is
that
these
people
originally,
whenever
qualified,
they
should
never
have
been
placed
upon
the
rolls,
whether
they
be
white
or
whether
they
be
black
because
under
louisiana
law,
under
the
constitution,
the
filling
of
the
registration
blank
itself
is
a
literacy
test.
now,
if
you
fail
to
pass
the
literacy
test,
that
is
the
only
time,
the
only
time
that
the
registrar
has
any
discretion.
he
has
no
discretion
whatsoever
under
245.
under
245
two
registered
voters
come
in
and
they
say
that
they
want
to
challenge
me
because
i
have
done
something
wrong,
i
have
misspelled
a
word,
the
registrar
must
--
under
the
louisiana
law,
issue
that
challenge.
he
sends
that
challenge
to
me
and
it's
up
to
me
to
get
three
registered
voters
to
come
in
and
attempt
to
traverse
that
affidavit.
you
ask
me
how
i
will
traverse
it,
supposing
i
spelled
the
name
of
louisiana
wrong,
suppose
and
i
spell
it
l-u-z-i-a-n-a
and
suppose
i
bring
three
registered
voters
with
me
who
think
that
i
have
spelled
louisiana
right
who
tell
me,
“i
agree,
that's
the
way
you
spell
louisiana,
l-u-z-i-a-n-a”
and
my
registrar
at
that
time
has
no
discretion.
he
has
to
accept
the
fact
that
you
spell
louisiana,
l-u-z-i-a-n-a.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
you
do
not.[laughter]
now,
wait
let
me
--
let
me
bring
my
point.
the
point
b
that
the
registrar
does
not
have
the
discretion
to
determine
how
to
spell
louisiana,
the
only
time
he
has
that
discretion
is
when
he
is
registering
an
individual
for
the
first
time.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
in
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
that
--
that's
right,
but
i
think
it
is
up
for
the
state
of
louisiana
court,
the
court
in
louisiana
to
tell
you
how
to
spell
louisiana.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
you
would
sustain
it
as
a
literacy
test
because
it's
unreasonable.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
no.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
held
this
in
a
case
cited
by
us,
bishop
versus
shipburn,
the
very
fact
in
miscalculation
of
age,
that
very
fact
has
been
held
to
disqualify
a
person
from
registering.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
your
honor,
let
me
say
this.
i
think
that
man
can.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
well,
of
course
your
honor,
that
--
that
example
there
is
--
is
as
ridiculous
as
some
of
the
things
that
may
occur
in
a
registration.
for
instance
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
your
honor
i
say
this,
that
if
the
two
people
who
come
in
with
that
--
with
three
people
coming
in
with
that
affidavit
to
indicate
that
they
agree
that
the
man
is
--
they
can't
subtract
58
from
a
certain
age
and
get
an
idea,
how
old
the
man
is
they
won't
know
either.
the
point
is
that
these
applications
are
on
the
rolls
right
now.
we
do
know
that
our
registrar
didn't
know
how
to
calculate.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
disqualification
that
it
is,
that's
where
the
222.[laughter]
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
like
to
say
something
today
to
try
--
court
by
a
misimpression.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
may
have
given
you
yesterday
when
the
implication
was
made
that
people
who
have
been
taken
off
the
rolls
under
this
challenge
system
would
have
to
go
back
and
take
some
different
type
of
literacy
test
or
different
type
of
test
as
required
by
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
state.
the
same
test
is
issued
to
anybody
when
they
register.
that
is
if
they
are
challenged
off
the
rolls
and
there
is
a
necessity
for
them
to
reregister,
they
pass
the
very
same
test
that
they
originally
took.
that
is
these
people
who
were
challenged
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
they
were
to
go
back
and
reregister,
they
would
be
required
to
take
no
more
than
the
same
test
that
they
took
previously.
that
test
being
completing
the
registration
blank
completely
without
blanks
and
thereby
becoming
what
the
louisiana
law
calls
a
duly
qualified
voter.
the
whole
theory
of
the
registrar's
case,
this
matter
has
been
brought
up
upon,
is
a
fact
that
we
believe
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
does
not
even
come
into
play
at
the
basis
for
the
government's
allegation
of
discrimination,
should
not
even
be
considered.
because
the
fact
that
these
people
were
challenged
from
the
rolls
was
because
they
had
made
a
mistake
in
their
application
for
registration
not
because
of
their
color.
there
are
no
reasons
in
louisiana
law
to
challenge
anybody
because
of
their
color.
under
the
louisiana
law,
you
must
first
pass
a
test
called
a
literacy
test.
you
pass
that
test
by
completely
filling
out
the
registration
application
blank.
in
this
particular
situation,
we
are
faced
with
a
registrar
who
allowed
his
rolls
to
become
clotted
up
with
illegal
and
irregular
voters.
under
the
section
which
this
case
has
brought
245,
which
gives
qualified
voters
an
opportunity
to
call
to
the
attention,
other
registrar,
these
facts,
it
becomes
more
apparent
why
you
have
a
need
for
such
a
section.
for
instance,
assuming
that
you
have
a
registrar
who
has
taken
office
and
let
us
assume
that
the
same
thing
has
happened
--
has
happened
in
washington
parish.
i
think
from
the
deposition
of
the
registrar
himself,
where
he
admits
that
he
believes
that
50%
of
the
white
people
on
these
rolls
have
similar
mistakes.
of
course,
our
position
is
that
they
don't
belong
on
the
roll.
they
are
not
qualified
anymore
than
the
colored
people
who
have
made
the
same
mistakes.
if
the
registrar
had
conducted
his
office,
we
believe,
in
accordance
with
the
louisiana
law,
none
of
these
people
who
are
irregularly
or
illegally
upon
the
roll,
should
be
there.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
now,
the
problem
is
what
is
the
solution?
under
judge
wright's
decree,
this
is
what
would
happen,
we
believe.
we
believe
that
judge
wright's
decree
indicates
that
you
must
ignore
these
mistakes.
ignore
the
mistakes
that
were
made
such
as
the
deviation
from
printed
materials,
the
miscalculation
of
age
and
the
misstatements
that
maybe
made
or
the
misspelled
words.
he
says
ignore
them
because
the
white
voter
has
not
been
challenged.
so
then,
he
concludes
that
the
only
reason
why
these
people
were
challenged
were
on
the
basis
of
their
color.
our
contention
being
that
you
cannot,
at
this
stage,
look
at
the
fifteenth
amendment
until
or
unless
you
can
show
that
the
only
basis
that
these
people
were
challenged
was
because
of
their
color.
if
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
as
a
matter
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right.
it's
an
act
of
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
to
bring
the
problem
even
closer,
if
--
if
i
may,
in
order
to
answer
your
question,
justice
frankfurter,
supposing
i
--
if
i'll
be
allowed
to
give
you
this
demonstration
which
maybe
will
bring
the
--
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
bring
out
to
the
court
a
little
bit
closer.
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
all
the
nine
justices
of
the
--
the
state
supreme
court
--
the
united
states
supreme
court
here,
all
members
are
the
voting
society
of
washington
parish
merely
for
the
sake
of
argument
to
demonstrate.
and
let's
assume
merely
again,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
we
attempt
to
put
the
members
of
the
federal
judiciary
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
that
is,
we
amend
the
fifteenth
amendment
right
now
for
the
sake
of
argument
of
placing
a
comma
and
adding
all
members
of
this
federal
judiciary.
i
then
go
into
washington
parish
as
an
individual
and
i
say
to
myself,
“subjectively
in
my
mind,
i'd
say,
i
do
not
care
for
federal
judgment.
and
what
i
am
going
to
try
and
do
is
to
disqualify
each
federal
judge
from
the
registration
rolls
on
the
basis
that
subjectively,
i
do
not
like
them.”
whatever
my
reason
is
would
be
immaterial.
now
the
registrar,
assuming
that
first,
he
does
not
even
know
what
subjectively
is
in
my
mind,
i
then
checked
each
one
of
the
judges
on
the
supreme
court.
each
one,
except
one,
makes
a
mistake
such
as
a
miscalculation
base
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
no,
sir.
[laughter]
such
as
a
misstatement
of
age,
a
deviation
from
printed
material,
all
leaving
a
blank,
now,
all
except
one.
now,
i
have
effective
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
right,
sir.
effectively,
i
have
issued
--
initiated
a
challenge
against
eight
judges.
subjectively,
i
just
don't
like
it.
the
ninth
judge
however,
even
though
i
don't
like
him,
i
cannot
subject
him
to
their
challenge
because
he
has
completed
his
court
correctly.
so
subjectively,
i
had
in
my
mind,
to
discriminate
against
federal
judges.
but
i
could
not
bring
that
to
a
conclusion
on
one
judge
because
he
did
not
fit
into
any
category
for
which
i
could
challenge
it.
so
therefore,
i
have
removed
eight
judges
from
the
roll.
now,
the
fifteenth
amendment,
even
though
i
bear
that
discrimination
maybe
in
my
mind,
cannot
be
brought
into
play
because
i
cannot
disqualify
you
as
a
registered
voter
in
the
state
of
louisiana
because
you
are
a
federal
judge.
but
if
you
make
a
mistake
on
your
application
for
registration,
which
i
think
is
enough
to
issue
a
challenge,
then
i
can
go
ahead
and
force
the
registrar
to
issue
you
a
challenge.
now,
what
remedy
do
you
have?
you
can
come
in
and
you
can
traverse
the
challenge
as
difficult
as
it
may
seem
to
traverse
the
challenge.
but
once
you
traverse
that
challenge,
the
challenger
has
no
right
at
all
to
keep
you
off
those
rolls.
the
registrar
must
put
you
back
on
those
rolls
and
then,
it
is
up
to
the
challenger
to
go
into
the
local
court
and
determine
whether
or
not,
he
had
a
right
to
determine
that
you
spell
louisiana,
l-u-z-i-a-n-a.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
i
have
to
accept
that
your
honor
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
--
that's
what
he
said.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
that
--
the
reason
why
that
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right.
it's
in
your
jury
case.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
let
--
let
me
try
and
answer
your
question
this
way.
in
the
field
of
qualification
of
voters,
i
don't
think
that
anybody
doubts
that
it's
up
to
the
state
to
set
those
qualifications
as
long
as
they
do
not
violate
the
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
federal
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
they
must
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
true.
but
the
--
the
state
of
louisiana
sets
the
laws
up.
they
all
administered
originally
to
--
to
really
show
you
here
what
happened.
originally,
if
you
look
at
the
statistics
if
there
was
any
discrimination
in
the
literacy
test,
it
was
the
discrimination
of
allowing
more
disqualified
colored
people
to
get
upon
the
roll
than
disqualified
white.
there
were
some
1700
people
who
are
on
the
rolls
who
were
colored
people,
and
now
that
1700,
some
1300
were
challenged.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
disagree
with
that
as
--
as
besides
the
point.
originally,
these
people
were
not
qualified
voters.
you
cannot
get
a
privilege
to
do
something
if
you
never
had
it
in
the
first
place.
these
people
were
never
voters.
what
judge
wright
has
done
in
our
opinion,
he
has
amended
the
registration
laws
by
saying
that
you
can
be
a
qualified
voter
on
the
state
of
louisiana
only
if
you're
colored,
if
you
deviate
from
the
printed
material,
if
you
miscalculate
your
age.
miscalculation
of
age
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
two
rights
do
not
--
i
mean,
two
rolls,
and
i
make
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
our
position
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
the
--
the
state
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
based
our
fact
that
these
people
were
disqualified
on
the
fact
that
they
have
not
answered
the
questions
correctly
in
a
literacy
test.
now,
had
they
originally
applied
and
made
the
same
mistakes
that
i've
been
a
registrar
of
voters
or
some
other
gentleman,
they
probably
would
have
never
gotten
on.
they
should've
never
gotten
on
the
rolls.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
no
offer
was
made
to
my
knowledge
of
that,
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
that's
--
what
i
am
trying
to
say,
sir,
is
that
the
findings
of
judge
wright
were
on
the
fact
that
he
ignored
in
my
opinion,
the
basic
requirement
of
the
louisiana
law
which
indicates
that
you
must
pass
the
test
for
illiteracy.
now,
what
he
did,
in
my
opinion,
is
that
he
ignored
that
particular
provision
of
the
registration
law
of
louisiana
and
because
he
ignored
that,
he
then
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
reason
why
these
people
were
challenged
was
because
they
were
of
a
particular
color.
in
addition,
he
seems
to
take
the
position
that
under
245,
which
gives
each
party,
either
white
or
colored,
a
chance
to
--
to
get
people
off
the
rolls
under
a
challenge.
he
seems
to
take
the
position
that
you
should
not
have
the
negroes
off
the
roll,
if
you
allow
the
white
people
upon
the
rolls.
he
ignores
the
fact,
in
my
opinion,
that
the
machinery
in
the
state
would
allow
him,
in
my
opinion
anyway,
to
do
something
and
insofar
as
the
registrar.
the
reason
why
i
say
that
mr.
chief
justice
is
that,
mr.
thomas,
who
was
a
registrar
of
voters,
was
in
this
position.
some
10
years
ago
or
eight
years
ago,
he
was
under
a
federal
court
order
not
to
discriminate
against
anybody
because
of
their
color.
in
the
meantime,
he
evidently,
being
afraid
of
violating
a
court
order,
took
some
people
on
the
roll
which
ordinarily
should
not
have
taken
just
exactly
from
fear.
and
then
when
a
group
of
people
called
the
citizens
council
or
individuals,
come
into
his
registration
office
and
attempt
to
challenge
only
colored
people,
he
didn't
know
what
to
do
so
he
said,
i'm
going
to
my
state
court
because
i
have
a
federal
court
order
hanging
over
my
head.
so,
i'm
going
to
my
state
court
to
see
whether
or
not,
i
can
take
these
challenges.
he
went
to
his
state
court.
his
state
court
told
him,
under
our
law,
he
must
go
ahead
and
accept
these
challenges
and
they've
thought
that
he
did
not
in
accepting
these
challenges,
because
they
were
--
the
state
court
concluded
for
cause,
violate
the
federal
injunction.
so
therefore,
he
proceeded
to
do
that
and
consequently,
he
was
sued,
made
a
party
to
the
suit
by
the
federal
government.
but
i
do
believe
that
judge
wright's
decision
just
ignored
the
fact
of
the
registration
laws.
what
he
has
taken,
he
has
put
on
a
roll,
two
types
of
disqualified
people.
the
mere
fact
that
the
white
people
are
--
are
on
the
roll
disqualified
and
the
colored
people
aren't
of
course,
i
think
this
is
--
the
solution
is
to
get
the
white
disqualified
people
off.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
right,
sir.
i
do.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
to
my
knowledge,
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
to
my
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
to
my
knowledge,
the
only
thing
that
would've
put
any
fear
in
him
would
be
the
local
political
situation,
whatever
that
might
be.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
now,
but
to
get
back
to
answer
your
question
about
the
misspelling,
see
our
contention
is
that
since
this
goes
to
the
qualification
of
the
voter
that
as
far
as
the
misspelling,
this
court
cannot
say
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
--
only
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
the
--
the
test
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
i'd
say
this,
mr.
justice
black,
that
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
we
have
requirements
insofar
as
registration
of
voters,
the
same
as
most
states
say
that
we
have
a
literacy
test.
now,
in
that
literacy
test
according
to
our
constitution,
you
cannot
leave
any
blanks.
now,
if
a
man
takes
an
application
and
misspells
a
word,
it's
going
to
be
to
somebody
to
determine.
i
cannot
give
you
a
louisiana
case,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
i
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
if
i
was
on
the
supreme
court
and
they
came
up
with
a
file
with
somebody
misspelling
a
word
like,
“mail,”
m-a-i-l
instead
of
m-a-l-e,
i
would
rule
that
i
understand
what
they're
talking
about.
but
the
government
here,
we
have
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
in
--
in
his
original
registration,
mr.
justice
black,
if
he
concludes
that
a
person
walking
in
has
misspelled
the
word
and
his
opinion,
he
believes
that
that
is
sufficient
to
disqualify
this
man,
he
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
he,
as
his
discretion,
right.
now,
that's
only
one
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
that
only
means
when
he
is
actually
registering
the
individual.
after
that,
it
becomes
a
mandatory
duty
for
the
registrar
to
accept
the
challenges
that
are
issued
to
him.
the
challenge
itself
does
not
remove
the
individual
from
the
roll,
but
it
does
put
him
to
the
trouble
of
answering
the
challenge.
but
the
registrar
has
no
discretion
once
the
challenge
is
issued.
as
i
--
i
gave
you
my
example,
i
walked
into
the
registrar's
office
and
i
say
that
you
miscalculated
your
age.
and
in
truth
and
in
fact,
maybe
you
didn't
miscalculate
your
age.
maybe
i'll
calculate
your
age
one
way
and
come
out
one
day
sooner
or
one
day
later.
but
you
are
required
--
now,
the
registrar
is
required
to
issue
you
that
challenge
and
you
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
to
issue
you
that
challenge.
you
get
that
challenge
and
then
you
come
back
into
his
office.
you
try
and
disapprove.
now,
if
you
would
ask
me
if
a
registrar
would
pull
somebody
disqualified
because
he
may
have
written
a
word,
wrong,
that
would
be
in
his
discretion
in
the
original
registration,
yes.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
but
not
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
wouldn't
deprive
him
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
--
under
his
right
to
vote.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
no,
sir.
i'd
say
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
i'd
say
this
that
if
the
president
of
our
biggest
university
came
in
and
he
misspelled
a
word
or
assuming
that
he
didn't
and
somebody
else
wanted
to
challenge
him
on
the
fact
that
he
misspelled
the
word
that
he
could
be
challenged.
that
is
under
section
245.
he
could
be
challenged
and
having
been
challenged,
it
would
be
up
to
him
to
go
ahead
and
traverse
that
challenge
even
though
he
is
the
president
of
the
biggest
university
we
have.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
because
mandatorily,
the
registrar
must
accept
those
challenges.
he
has
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
--
if
the
challenger
indicated
that
that
was
a
mistake
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
--
that's
what
he
would
have
to
traverse.
the
fact
--
let's
assume
that
he
could
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
he
would
--
he
would
do
this.
he
would
ask
a
man
to
come
on
in
on
the
challenge
and
he
would
have
to
correctly
register,
if
that
was
the
challenge
that
was
issued
because
he
forgot
to
cross
a
t.
he
would
have
to
come
in
and,
of
course,
fill
out
this
card
correctly.
the
correct
way
of
filling
out
the
card
would
be
to
cross
the
t.
same
that
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
say
he
does
have
an
active
part
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
individual
--
actually
he
does
use
the
--
the
statute
245,
but
he
has
no
way
at
all
of
removing
the
individual
himself
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
the
two
qualified
voters
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
we
do
that
because
we
may
have
a
registrar
who
has
a
registration
roll
just
clotted
with
illegally
registered
people.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
i
--
i
think
that
the
registrar
can
from
the
reading
of
the
louisiana
law,
there
is
no
precise
provision.
but
after
reading
at
the
law
and
indicating
what
this
--
mr.
thomas,
has
done
in
his
--
his
deposition,
that
if
i
had
been
in
mr.
thomas'
shoes
and
if
this
case
had
not
been
pending,
i
would've
advised
mr.
thomas
to
go
through
his
rolls
and
clear
the
rolls
out
of
every
illegal
vote
he
has
whether
that
voter
is
white,
colored,
green
or
pink.
because
he
has
allowed
people,
in
our
opinion,
of
his
testimony
to
remain
on
that
roll,
who
were
not
qualified
and
in
effect
therefore,
discriminate
against
qualified
voters.
why
not
colored?
there
are
two
--
200
somewhat
colored
voters
still
on
the
roll.
those
colored
voters,
if
they
wanted
to,
could
do
that.
they
could
go
in
under
this
challenge.
two
of
them
can
go
in,
since
he
admits
that
50%
meres
a
practical,
political
matter,
that's
what
i
would
have
done.
how
to
use
my
two
voters,
how
to
go
on
in,
how
to
clean
those
rolls
up,
if
the
registrar
wouldn't
do
it,
and
our
intentions
are
no
matter
how
this
case
comes
about,
is
to
make
sure
that
a
man
like
mr.
thomas
is
not
in
a
position
to
administer
the
registration
laws
of
the
state.
because
we
think
that
they
administered
wrong,
because
people
who
are
not
qualified
no
matter
what
color
they
be,
should
not
be
placed
upon
the
roll.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
right.
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
i'll
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
i
--
i
will
agree
with
the
statements
you've
made,
except
the
implication
which
seemed
to
be
that
they
specifically
went
in
and
only
got
1377
from
the
registrar
when
in
truth
and
in
fact,
they
actually
searched
the
records
because
these
courts
are
in
different
locations
and
they
filed
out
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
he
--
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
what
you
have
done
in
this
case
then,
you
have
put
the
registrar
into
--
in
my
opinion,
anyway,
to
the
mind
reading
school.
how
many
challenges
should
a
registrar
receive
before
he
concludes
in
his
own
mind
that
this
is
discrimination?
should
he
only
receive
two
whites
and
two
blacks?
mr.
henry
j.
roberts,
jr.
anymore
questions?
