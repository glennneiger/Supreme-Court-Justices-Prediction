the
only
thing
that
bothers
me
about
it
was
it
if

in
the
same
paragraph
where
it
said
that,
it
also
said,
“but
without
taking
away
the
right
of
the
taxpayer
to
take
the
case
to
the
board,”
that
--
that's
the
board

appeals
before
the

that's
--
that's
a
little
troublesome,
isn't
it?

how
he
can
he

mr.

what
has

the

--
of
the
commissioner
between
the
time
this
1938
proposal
was
made
and
the
1954
change
in

did
they
continue
to
use
these
waivers
in
the
manner
they've
been
used
in
this
case
or
not?
chief

they
followed
--

followed
the
practice
of

--
in
that

warren
but
without
taking
away
the
right

the
taxpayer
--
of
the
taxpayer
to
take
the
case
to
the
