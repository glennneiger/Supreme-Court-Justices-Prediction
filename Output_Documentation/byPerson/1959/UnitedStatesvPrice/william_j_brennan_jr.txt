now,
that
is
292,
rather
272.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
heffron,
may
i
ask
that
in
the
--
that
--
the
problem
concerned
with
word,
“restriction”,
in
other
words,
whether
restrictions
may
include
the
waiver
of
the
90-day
notice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
waiver
of
the
right
to
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
present
purposes,
he's
not
contesting
liability
as
in
your
case,
where
he
--
the
self
assessor,
computes
a
certain
tax.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
--
he's
not
contesting
liability
in
that
case.
now
here,
the
very
issue
is
whether
--
whether
he
waived
the
right
to
contest
liability
or
whether
he's
simply
waived
the
assessment
and
collection
of
the
--
of
the
tax.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
very
issue
involved
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
until
there
is
such
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
when
the
fact
you
compete
as
or
(inaudible)
deficiency,
that's
a
technical
term,
maybe
that
comes
to
the
existence
after
the
90-day
notice
is
sent.
