mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
suppose
problem
that
presents
itself
to
the
court
is
like
the
most
problems
that
present
themselves
to
men
throughout
their
lives.
the
result,
well,
to
some
extent,
if
not
wholly
depend
upon
the
framework
of
reference
within
which
you
view
it,
or
the
set
of
perspectives
with
which
one
views
it.
in
the
presentation
by
counsel,
great
emphasis
has
been
laid
upon
the
fact
that
this
is
a
situation
where
a
taxpayer
is
not
contesting
liability.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
we
would
have
to
dispute
that.
the
waiver
form
which
is
involved
in
this
case
and
the
waiver
form
which
is
used
by
the
treasury
in
thousands
of
cases,
is
found
in
page
15
of
the
transcript.
it
states
--
i'm
sorry,
may
it
please
the
court,
page
14
and
page
15.
it
states
at
the
bottom
of
that
form
that
the
execution
and
filing
of
this
waiver
at
the
address
shown
in
the
accompanying
letter,
will
expedite
the
adjustment
of
your
tax
liability
as
indicated
above.
it
is
not
however,
a
final
closing
agreement
under
section
3760
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
does
not
therefore,
preclude
the
assertion
of
a
further
deficiency
in
the
matter
provided
by
law,
should've
subsequently
be
determined
that
additional
taxes
due,
nor
does
it
extend
the
statutory
period
of
limitation
for
refund,
assessment
or
collection
of
the
tax.
in
other
words,
when
a
taxpayer
has
executed
such
a
waiver
form,
this
tax
liability
for
the
year
has
not
been
settled.
there
are
many
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
sustained
the
commissioner
in
asserting
deficiencies
and
during
a
period
beyond
the
execution
of
such
a
waiver.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
yes.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
but
our
position
here
is
that
he
has
assessed.
he
is
--
he
is
consenting
to
the
assessment
of
a
tax
which
is
based
on
a
determination
of
a
deficiency.
and
that
here,
there
has
never
been
a
determination
of
a
deficiency
and
our
reasoning
was
based
on
the
language
of
sections
272
(a)
and
272
(d)
and
i'd
like
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
well,
i
think
in
the
ninth
circuit,
that
a
waiver
form
such
as
this
is
premature
and
invalid.
it's
executed
before
a
notice
of
deficiency
has
been
issued.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
well,
because
the
assessment
is
often
that
made
after
--
after
the
90-day
letter
is
issued,
it
will
be
made
after
90
days
have
expired.
but
let
us
take
a
case
--
well,
let
us
take
a
case
where
the
notice
of
deficiency
is
issued
on
january
1st
of
1936.
normally,
the
commissioner
--
or
rather
the
commissioner
cannot
assess
until
february,
march,
april
1st
of
1936.
there's
90
days
that
must
wait.
in
this
case,
if
the
notice
of
deficiency
is
issued
on
january
the
1st,
1936,
the
commissioner
may
then
assess
the
tax
and
bill
for
interest
on
january
2nd,
1936,
if
the
taxpayer
has
executed
a
waiver
form,
when
he
has
received
the
notice
of
deficiency.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
understood
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
yes.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
we
did
not
get
a
notice
of
deficiency
here,
your
honor.
the
taxpayer,
that
is,
did
not
receive
a
notice
of
deficiency.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know.
i
did
not
represent
these
people
at
that
time,
your
honor.
now,
our
point
and
i
think
the
important
one
that
we
urge
here
is
that
--
it
seems
to
us
that
prior
to
1954,
if
the
interpretation
is
placed
upon
section
272
(a)
and
272
(d),
which
the
government
urges,
it
means
that
a
taxpayer
who
execute
such
a
waiver,
never
receives
a
right
to
go
to
the
tax
court.
and
in
this
particular
case,
because
the
notice
of
deficiency,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
--
is
not
issued
by
the
commissioner
when
such
a
waiver
form
has
been
executed.
now,
in
the
particular
case
before
the
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
once
a
waiver
form
such
as
the
one
before
the
court
has
been
executed,
it
is
the
practice
of
the
commissioner,
not
to
issue
a
statutory
notice
of
deficiency.
consequently,
there
is
no
opportunity
ever
given
or
afforded
to
the
taxpayer
to
appeal
that
assessment
or
determination
of
the
deficiency.
i
used
the
word,
“to
the
tax
court
of
united
states.”
he
must
first
pay
the
tax,
then
file
a
claim
for
a
refund
and
sue
for
refund.
but
may
it
please
your
honor
in
this
case,
and
this
is
the
reason,
i
think,
this
is
a
good
case
for
a
decision
to
be
reached
on
this
problem.
this
taxpayer
will
never
have
had
a
determination
on
the
merits
as
to
the
tax
involved
herein,
for
the
reason
that
no
notice
of
deficiency
was
issued
therefore,
she
could
not
go
to
the
tax
court.
when
the
suit
was
filed
in
the
district
court
below,
it
was
filed
seeking
judgment
for
x
dollars
of
tax,
based
on
this
waiver
form.
i
did
not
offer
evidence
dealing
with
the
merits
of
the
deficiency.
had
i
done
so,
i
would've
expected
that
it
would've
been
excluded
on
the
ground
that
the
commissioner
was
attempting
to
obtain
judgment
based
on
an
amount
of
tax
which
purportedly
by
the
terms
of
the
waiver,
has
been
agreed
to
by
the
taxpayer.
furthermore,
there
would've
been
another
defect
had
we
offered
such
evidence.
one
of
the
prerequisites
for
a
suit
for
refund
is
that
a
claim
for
refund
must
have
been
filed
further
to,
and
so
it
seems
to
us
that
here
is
a
case
in
which
a
taxpayer
will
not
ever
be
able
to
have
a
determination
on
the
merits
of
this
particular
tax.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so.
and
the
reason
i
say
not
is
that
i
don't
--
i
don't
argue
or
i'm
contending
that
these
waiver
forms
consent
to
an
assessment
if
executed
without
the
prior
issuance
of
a
notice
of
deficiency.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
yes,
but
it
also
says,
may
i
offer
respectfully,
your
honor.
at
the
top
of
the
provision
--
at
the
top
of
the
waiver
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
272
(d),
that
it
is
our
argument
that
pursuant
to
the
sections
of
272
(d)
means
that
there
must
first
be
a
determination
of
a
deficiency.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
is
our
view,
your
honor.
in
fact,
we
argue
that
the
90-day
letter
should've
been
issued
before
the
notice
of
--
that
--
that
is
this
waiver
was
sent
to
the
taxpayer
and
executed.
and
that
this
waiver
is
a
useless
act.
that
was
a
position
the
ninth
circuit
took
in
the
two
cases
which
they
decided.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
well,
i
think
he
can,
your
honor,
except
for
the
provisions
of
the
statute
which
provide
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
but
i
think
the
language
of
section
272
(d)
and
may
i
just
refer
to
the
two
words
which
i
think
are
--
the
controlling
words
in
this
particular
problem.
at
the
bottom
of
section
272
(d),
which
is
the
waiver
of
restrictions,
which
the
commissioner
relies
upon
here
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
its
page
4,
of
the
brief
for
sydelle
price,
about
two
thirds
of
the
way
down,
the
provision
states,
“waiver
of
restrictions.”
the
taxpayer
shall,
at
anytime,
have
the
right
by
a
signed
notice
in
writing
filed
with
the
commissioner
to
waive
what?
to
waive
the
restrictions
provided
in
subsection
(a)
of
this
section
on
the
assessment
and
collection
of
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
deficiency.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
well,
he
probably
could
contract
with
the
government
the
way
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
i
doubt
that,
your
honor,
because
it
says
on
the
surface
of
the
instrument
that
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
well,
but
--
but
that
is
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
as
the
matter
of
fact,
the
vast
majority
refund
suits
that
at
least
come
from
our
office
are
based
on
this
waiver
forms,
that
is,
they've
been
executed,
the
tax
had
been
paid.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
no.
it
seems
to
me,
your
--
your
honor,
that
our
argument
is
that
he
may
waive
it,
when
he's
got
it
or
when
he's
been
given
the
right
to
go
to
the
tax
court.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
is
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
determination.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
will
then
refer
up
to
the
top
of
section
272,
you
will
find,
in
the
first
sentence,
the
qualifying
words,
if
in
the
case
of
any
taxpayer
the
commissioner
determines
that
there
is
a
deficiency,
it
is
our
view
that
the
words,
“the
deficiency,”
refer
to
a
determination
of
the
deficiency.
there
cannot
be
a
deficiency
until
one
has
been
determined.
now,
judge
simons,
in
the
moore
case,
took
the
view
there
could
ascertainment
on
a
tentative
basis,
and
i
respectfully
challenge
that
notion.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
i'm
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i'm
relying
on
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
and
on
the
legislative
history
behind
that
particular
section
which
indicates
proof.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
at
the
end
of
the
last
session
whether
we
were
relying
upon
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
and
that
is
correct.
however,
in
the
brief,
we've
attempted
to
add
some
small
amount
of
legislative
history
to
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
in
an
effort
to
aid
the
court
in
determining
how
this
particular
section
should
be
interpreted
today.
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
before
i
sit
down
a
little
bit
of
that
legislative
history.
in
the
first
place,
when
this
section
272
(d)
was
first
inserted
into
the
revenue
act
of
1926,
it
was
the
act
of
thought
not
apparent.
in
other
words
section
272
is
a
procedural
section
by
which
a
taxpayer
is
afforded
a
method
of
going
to
the
tax
court
of
the
united
states.
it
is
not
a
section
which
restricts
the
commissioner
from
collecting
the
tax
under
certain
circumstances
as
a
matter
of
emphasis
i
understand.
but
then
when
section
272
(d)
was
added
to
the
act
in
1926,
it
provided,
and
i'd
like
to
read
directly
from
the
senate
finance
committee
report,
that
the
law
provide
that
where
deficiency
is
assessed,
there
shall
be
assessed
at
the
same
time
interest
at
the
rate
of
6%
from
the
time
the
deficiency
should've
been
paid
to
the
date
of
assessment,
in
order
to
commit
the
taxpayer
to
pay
the
tax
and
stop
the
running
of
interest.
the
committee
recommends
in
section
274
(d),
which
was
the
predecessor
of
272
(d),
of
the
bill
that
the
taxpayer
at
any
time
be
permitted
to
waive
in
writing
the
restrictions
on
the
commissioner
against
assessing
and
collecting
the
tax,
but
without
taking
away
the
right
of
the
taxpayer
to
take
the
case
to
the
board.
now,
it
is
our
view
that
since
there
is
only
one
way
that
the
taxpayer
may
take
the
case
to
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
i.e.,
a
statutory
notice
of
deficiency
having
been
issued
that
this
language
simply
means
that
a
taxpayer
wants
to
have
the
right
to
waive
the
restrictions
against
assessment
and
stop
the
running
of
interest
after
he
had
first
received
a
notice
of
deficiency.
in
1933,
the
first
of
the
decisions
of
the
ninth
circuit
which
held
these
waivers
to
be
premature
and
invalid
was
handed
down
and
that
was
the
case
filed
mutual
lumber
versus
poe.
the
position
of
the
court
was
reaffirmed
in
1935
in
a
case
entitled
mccarthy
versus
commissioner
and
those
were
the
only
two
cases
dealing
with
the
validity
of
these
waivers
under
section
272
(d)
until
about
1938.
at
that
time,
a
subcommittee
of
the
ways
&
means
committee
of
the
house
of
representatives
proposed,
and
i
quote
from
the
language
of
that
report,
“as
the
result
of
two
decisions
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
mutual
lumber
versus
poe,
mccarthy
versus
commissioner,
a
valid
waiver
cannot
be
given
by
a
taxpayer
prior
to
the
formal
determination
of
the
commissioner
as
evidenced
by
a
60
or
90-day
letter
that
there
is
a
deficiency
in
tax.”
although
that
report
was
issued,
no
amendment
was
made
in
1938.
then
in
1942,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
proposed
an
administrative
procedural
code
in
which
again,
there
was
a
provision
proposed
to
remedy
this
situation.
that
code
or
proposal
was
not
adopted.
however,
in
1954;
the
congress
finally
did
make
a
change
in
this
section
which
is
now
before
the
court,
section
272
(d),
and
they
added
the
words
whether
or
not
a
notice
of
deficiency
has
been
added.
now,
the
taxpayer
submits
that
this
legislative
history
sustains
the
proposition
that
these
waivers
could
not
be
valid
unless
a
prior
notice
of
deficiency
had
first
been
issued.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
yes
that
is
correct
your
honor,
except
there
is
one
interesting
feature.
i
was
at
one
time
with
chief
counsel's
office
of
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue,
and
at
that
time,
they
were
used
in
the
manner
in
which
they
were
used
in
this
case.
however,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
almost
every
case
which
the
government
has
cited
here,
the
waiver
form
was
entitled
at
the
top;
waiver
of
right
to
file
petition
in
the
tax
court
of
united
states.
then,
as
a
result
of
some
of
the
decisions,
the
form
of
the
waiver
was
changed
and
the
provision
at
the
top
provided
waiver
of
restrictions
on
assessment
and
collection
of
deficiency
in
the
tax.
so,
that
while
it
is
true
that
the
commissioner
has
used
these
waiver
forms
in
the
manner
which
they
were
used
here,
i
think
the
question
was
at
least
that
the
taxpayer
knew,
that
is
the
taxpayer
who
was
not
represented
by
counsel,
what
he
was
waiving,
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
terminology
of
the
waiver
form
which
advices
a
taxpayer
who
is
not
a
lawyer
that
he
is
waiving
his
right
to
appeal
to
the
tax
court
of
the
united
states.
all
it
says
is
that
he's
waiving
his
right,
waiving
whatever
restrictions
there
are
on
assessment
and
collection
of
the
deficiency.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
sir?
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
well,
of
course
your
honor
it's
our
view
that
it
can't
be
waived
until
the
notice
has
been
issued
and
there
has
been
a
determination
of
the
deficiency.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
if--
if
you
view
these
waiver
forms
that's
concerning
to
an
assessment
or
agreeing
to
default,
in
other
words,
that
one
is
inclined
to
say
that
a
taxpayer
should
not
be
permitted
to
stand
upon
a
technical
position
as
no
notice
of
deficiency
has
been
issued.
i
don't
view
them
as
such
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
commissioner
does
not
view
them
as
such,
because
the
very
terms
of
the
waiver
itself
provide
that
they
are
not
a
determination
of
the
taxpayer's
tax
liability.
the
note
that
follows
at
the
bottom
of
the
waiver
forms
states
flatly
that
they
are
not
the
final
closing
agreements
and
that
further
deficiencies
may
be
determined.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
is
true
your
honor.
assuming
the
taxpayer
has
the
funds
to
pay
the
tax.
in
this
case,
there
were
no
such
funds
and
that's
why
the
commissioner
was
forced
to
sue
in
the
district
court
for
judgment,
in
order
to
have
that
judgment
in
the
event
the
taxpayer
subsequently
obtain
funds.
i
--
i
know
that
this
argument
that
the
commissioner
makes
that
really
this
is
not
such
a
disastrous
situation
because
taxpayer
can
pay
the
tax
and
subsequently
sue
for
a
refund
is
valid
to
the
extent
that
it
has
a
taxpayer
involved
who
has
the
funds
to
pay
a
tax
but
there
are
many
who
do
not.
and
i
would
say
that
in
reply
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
that
if
you
look
at
this
as
though
it
were
a
contract
or
an
agreement
despite
what
the
language
of
the
section
provides
that
you
may
say
that
the
taxpayer
should
be
bound
by
it.
however,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
waiver
form
itself
states
that
it
is
filed
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
272
(d).
and
now
we
are
back
to
272
(d)
which
gets
us
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
that
in
section
272
(d),
it
states
that
the
taxpayer
shall
have
the
right
at
any
time
to
waive
the
restrictions
on
the
assessment
and
collection
of
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
deficiency.
and
it
is
the
two
words,
“the
deficiency,”
which
the
taxpayer
relies
on
your
honor.
the
words
“the
deficiency”
it
seems
to
us
must
be
interpreted
by
referring
to
subsection
272
(a)
which
is
the
same
section
and
you
will
find
those
two
words
in
the
second
sentence
of
section
272
(a).
they
are
the
last
two
words.
it
says,
“for
a
redetermination
of
the
deficiency.”
a
reading
of
that
sentence
refers
one
back
to
the
first
sentence
of
section
272
(a)
which
states,
“if
the
commissioner
determines
that
there
is
a
deficiency
in
respect
to
the
tax.”
and
it
was
the
view
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
it
is
our
view
that
those
words
qualify
section
272
(d),
that
is,
there
must
be
a
determination
of
the
deficiency
before
a
taxpayer
may
waive
or
file
a
valid
waiver
under
section
272
(d).
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
i
do
not
know,
i
did
not
represent
these
taxpayers.
however,
let
us
assume
that
that
was
the
case
mr.
justice
whittaker,
the
--
the
30-day
letter
creates
no
rights
to
go
to
any
court
to
litigate
or
to
dispute
the
matter
except
within
the
confines
of
the
treasury
department
itself.
now,
the
government
has
used
the
number
of
taxpayers
and
the
amount
of
revenue
that's
involved
here
as
some
indication
of
the
importance
of
this
decision.
i
of
course
cannot
compete
with
the
millions
of
dollars
that
may
be
involved
but
i
would
like
to
point
this
out
to
the
court
that
this
decision,
this
view
of
the
ninth
circuit
has
been
the
law
in
that
circuit
since
1933.
the
other
decisions
in
conflict
thereto
had
been
the
law
since
about
1939
or
1940
i
think
moore
versus
cleveland
railroad
was
decided
in
1940.
therefore,
this
is
a
problem
which
has
existed
for
at
least
25
years.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
no
the
commissioner
has
not
issued
a
notice
of
deficiency
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
order
to
sustain
the
validity
of
the
waiver
form.
he
has
adopted
the
same
practice
that
he
has
used
throughout
the
country
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
--
that
is
not
issuing
the
notice
of
deficiency
once
the
waiver
form
as
executed.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
so
that
if
the
government
is
in
difficulty
now
on
a
nationwide
basis,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
because
the
case
is
now
here
on
appeal,
because
prior
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
there
was
only
one
circuit
which
adapted
this
view
that
was
the
ninth
circuit.
the
other
two
circuits
had
adapted
the
contrary
position
and
so
had
the
court
of
claims.
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
if
it
has
the
time
that
roos
versus
u.s.,
a
court
of
claims
case
that
dealt
with
this
problem
and
there
is
language
in
that
opinion
which
indicates
that
the
judge
who
wrote
the
opinion
believed
that
the
senate
finance
committee
language
of
1926
stating
that
such
a
waiver
could
be
executed
but
without
taking
away
the
right
of
the
taxpayer
to
go
to
the
board
meant
that
the
taxpayer
could
not
waive
his
right
to
go
to
the
tax
court
of
the
united
states.
one
other
point
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i
don't
understand
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
yes.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
yes
i
have
his
explanation
but
i
am
--
it's
very
frank
to
say
i
don't
follow
it,
because
the
language
very
clearly
says
that
without
taking
away
the
right
of
the
taxpayer
to
take
the
case
to
the
board.
i
don't
think
the
case
refers
to
an
overpayment.
i
think
it
refers
to
the
determination
of
the
deficiency.
now,
one
other
and
final
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
and
answer
to
a
question
that
was
raised
was
whether
--
i
think
mr.
justice
whittaker
raised
that,
whether
a
taxpayer
didn't
obtain
a
great
deal
of
(inaudible)
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
tax
could
be
assessed
immediately
after
the
waiver
form
or
at
the
90-day
letter
had
been
issued,
immediately
after
the
90-day
letter
had
been
issued.
the
--
the
commissioner
is
not
required
to
assess
the
tax
once
the
90-day
letter
had
been
issued,
he
may
wait
until
the
appropriate
statute
of
limitations
has
expired
before
assessing
the
tax
if
there's
no
waiver
form
executed.
that
is
if
a
90-day
letter
is
issued
and
a
taxpayer
does
not
appeal
to
the
tax
court,
he
may
wait
until
a
year
or
two
years
has
gone
by
assuming
there
is
that
much
time
left
and
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
for
the
assessment
of
the
tax.
it
is
his
practice
however
to
assess
the
tax
fairly
shortly
after
the
90-days
has
run.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
except
as
required
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
well
i
thought
your
honor
had
pointed
out
that
the
taxpayer
was
obtaining
a
great
deal
of
benefit
by
having
executed
a
waiver
form
such
as
we
have
in
this
case
regardless
of
whether
or
not
a
notice
of
deficiency
had
been
issued.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
if
--
if
the
conclusion
has
reached
that
such
a
waiver
form
is
valid
without
a
notice
of
deficiency.
that
is
he
does
stop
the
running
of
interest
if
this
waiver
form
is
valid
without
the
notice
of
deficiency
having
been
issued
prior
thereto.
thank
you.
