mr.
howard
a.
heffron
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
reaches
this
court
on
a
government
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
action
involves
a
suit
by
the
united
states
for
the
collection
of
income
taxes
which
were
allegedly
due
and
owing
for
the
year
1946
in
an
amount
just
short
of
$10,000.
after
a
full
trial
in
the
district
court,
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
suit
on
the
merits,
holding
that
it
could
not
be
maintained
under
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
ninth
circuit
after
hearing
the
appeal
en
banc
affirmed
that
disposition,
so
that
the
ultimate
question
before
this
court
is
whether
this
collection
suit
for
the
recovery
of
internal
revenue
taxes
maybe
maintained.
now,
in
order
to
answer
that
question,
we
must
first
turn
to
the
statute
which
provides
that
a
collection
action
may
not
be
maintained
unless
certain
statutory
formalities
have
been
complied
with.
those
statutory
formalities
relate
to
the
matter
of
affording
to
the
taxpayer
an
opportunity
to
go
to
the
tax
court
and
contest
the
merits
of
the
asserted
claim
for
taxes
prior
to
payment.
in
this
case,
it
is
agreed
that
certain
of
the
statutory
formalities
were
not
complied
with.
to
wit,
the
sending
of
the
statutory
notice,
sometimes
called
the
“90-day
letter”
provided
in
the
code,
which
formally
advises
the
taxpayer
that
the
commissioner
is
asserting
a
deficiency
in
tax.
that
letter
was
not
sent
and
the
question
is
whether
the
government
was
relieved
of
the
statutory
obligation
of
sending
that
letter
by
reason
of
a
certain
document
filed
by
the
taxpayer
in
this
case.
now,
that
document
is
called
an
870
waiver
and
it's
a
piece
of
paper
which
provides
that
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
restrictions
provided
in
the
code
are
waived
and
consent
is
given
to
the
assessment
and
collection
of
the
following
deficiencies
in
tax,
which
are
then
set
forth.
this
document
is
signed
by
the
taxpayer.
the
sole
question
before
this
court
is
the
effect
to
be
given
to
this
waiver
that
the
waiver
is
valid
and
binding
as
the
government
contends,
then
the
commissioner
was
relieved
of
the
obligation
of
sending
a
90-day
deficiency
notice.
and
in
that
event,
the
prohibitions
against
collection
actions
are
not
applicable
and
the
suit
maybe
maintained,
if
on
the
other
hand,
as
taxpayer
contends,
the
waiver,
as
a
matter
of
law,
was
ineffective
to
relieve
the
commissioner
of
the
obligation
of
providing
the
taxpayer
with
the
90-day
deficiency
notice
as
a
prerequisite
to
assessment
of
the
tax,
then
this
action
admittedly
has
been
brought
under
circumstances
in
which
this
internal
revenue
code
provides,
it
may
not
be
maintained,
that
is,
the
formalities
would
not
have
been
complied
with.
in
that
event,
the
period
for
assessment
having
already
expired,
taxpayer
will
be
relieved
of
this
obligation
and
will
have
the
action
dismissed.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
your
honor
please.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
under
the
provisions
of
the
code,
as
they
stood
at
the
time
the
board
of
tax
appeals
was
created,
interest
upon
an
amount
asserted
by
the
commissioner
as
a
deficiency,
runs
from
the
time
the
tax
should
have
been
paid
until
such
time
as
there
is
in
assessment.
that
is
interest
upon
the
deficiency.
once
there
is
an
assessment,
there
is
another
provision
which
provides
for
interest
upon
the
assessment,
in
the
event,
it
is
not
paid
with
in
the
10-day
period
provided.
the
notice
of
deficiency
is
a
procedural
means
whereby
congress
created
recourse
to
the
board
of
tax
appeals
for
a
review
of
the
merits
of
the
government's
asserted
claim
for
taxes
prior
to
payment.
and
the
statute
provides
that
when
the
commissioner
is
a
--
asserting
a
deficiency
in
tax,
and
that
the
term,
“deficiency”
is
itself
define
in
the
code.
in
that
event,
he
shall
provide
the
taxpayer
with
a
formal
letter
which
notifies
him
of
the
assertion
of
that
claim.
when
that
letter
is
provided,
the
taxpayer
has
90
days
in
which
to
petition
the
tax
court
for
review.
he
fails
to
petition
within
that
period,
then
at
the
end
of
90
days,
the
commissioner
may
assess
the
tax
and
proceed
to
collect
it.
he
does
petition
the
tax
court,
why
then
the
assessment
is
delayed
until
the
final
determination
of
the
tax
court
is
made.
now,
under
the
provisions
of
the
code
as
they
stood
and
as
they
stand
today,
interest
runs
during
this
entire
process
against
the
taxpayer
on
the
amount
which
may
ultimately
be
found
one
way
or
another
to
have
been
due,
over
and
above
that
which
he
reported
as
due.
and
in
1926,
an
amendment
was
enacted,
the
internal
revenue
code,
to
provide
the
taxpayer
with
a
means
by
which
he
could
stop
the
running
of
interest
against
him,
in
the
event,
he
did
not
wish
to
proceed
by
--
via
the
tax
court
route.
provide
a
means
whereby
the
restrictions
upon
the
commissioner
which
prohibited
him
from
immediately
assessing
the
tax
until
he
had
afforded
the
taxpayer
an
opportunity
to
go
to
the
tax
court
could
be
waived.
and
under
that
section
whose
construction
is
in
dispute
in
this
action.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
that
is
272
(d).
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
set
forth
in
our
brief
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
on
page
2.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
there
--
in
the
1954
code,
a
parenthetical
clause
was
inserted
in
the
applicable
section
that
provide
this
waiver
of
the
formalities
by
which
the
commissioner
proceeds
to
collect
the
tax,
maybe
filed
by
the
taxpayer,
whether
or
not,
a
notice
of
deficiency
has
been
sent
to
him.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
our
position
is
that
--
that
was
the
law
prior
to
the
1954
code.
and
that
this
language
in
the
1954
code
was
made
necessary
by
a
conflict
in
the
holdings
of
the
circuit
court.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
it
would
--
it
would
be
a
rule
which
would
apply
to
the
validity
of
assessments
which
had
been
made
on
the
strength
of
these
waivers.
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
assessment
which
is
an
issue
in
this
case
upon
the
taxpayer
filing
this
waiver
that
commissioner
proceeded
to
assess
the
tax.
he
did
not
send
the
90-day
letter,
the
means
by
which
the
taxpayer
could
have
petitioned
the
tax
court,
but
proceeded
to
assess
it
and
it
is
the
legality
of
that
assessment
which
is
in
dispute
in
this
action
because
if
the
waiver
was
ineffective,
the
assessment
could
not
issue
without
a
90-day
letter
having
been
sent.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
it's
difficult
to
pursue
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
to
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
to
compute
the
precise
number
of
cases
in
which
this
issue
is
involved
is
not
possible,
but
we
can
get
some
clue
to
the
figures
by
--
by
an
indication
of
the
manner
in
which
it
has
been
used
in
this
way.
for
the
last
five
years
of
operation
under
the
1939
code,
we
have
been
advised
by
the
internal
revenue
service
that
approximately
1,600,000
tax
returns
were
closed
on
the
strength
of
waivers
of
this
kind.
that
is
waivers
which
were
followed
by
assessments
and
not
90-day
letters.
in
addition,
there
are
approximately
27,000
cases
pending
and
district
directors
offices
all
over
the
country
under
the
1939
code,
whose
procedure
will
be
affected
by
the
result
in
this
case.
and
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
that
practice
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
that
practice
is
still
followed.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
that
is
the
procedure
which
the
commissioner
affords
for
administrative
resolution
of
these
matters.
now,
in
addition
the
last
annual
report
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
discloses
that
there
are
now
estimated
900,000
active
delinquent
accounts
of
taxpayers
involving
income
taxes
and
presumably,
the
same
kind
of
defense
which
was
asserted
by
the
taxpayer
in
this
case,
can
be
asserted
by
all
other
delinquent
taxpayers
under
the
1939
code
against
whom
collection
suits
are
brought.
so
it's
fair
to
say
that
there
are
literally
thousands
of
tax
returns
and
tax
years
which
will
be
affected
by
this
decision,
as
well
as
the
determination
of
the
ninth
circuit
holding
as
it
did
that
an
assessment
could
not
follow
upon
a
waiver
of
this
kind,
invites
the
--
the
bringing
of
actions
both
to
restrain
the
collection
of
taxes
and
the
defensive
actions
on
the
same
basis
asserted
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
our
problem
is
whether
the
term,
“restrictions”
as
it
is
used
there,
which
the
taxpayer
is
authorized
to
waive,
includes
the
sending
of
the
90-day
letter.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
yes,
the
taxpayer
contends
that
this
--
the
sending
of
a
90-day
letter
is
not
one
of
the
restrictions
and
is
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
and
it's
the
government's
position
that
restrictions
means
all
restriction
and
that
a
90-day
letter,
which
is
a
prerequisite
to
assessing
a
tax,
is
as
much
a
restriction
upon
assessing
the
tax
as
any
of
the
other
requirements
and
prohibitions
set
forth
in
the
statute.
and
further
that
the
language
of
the
act
which
says,
“at
anytime
the
taxpayer
may
file
a
waiver,”
means
precisely
what
is
says,
“at
anytime.”
now,
the
--
the
waiver
provision
was
enacted
as
a
result
of
this
problem
of
interest,
as
it
was
conceived
of
at
that
time,
the
taxpayer
was
liable
for
interest
from
the
date
the
tax
should've
been
paid
until
the
assessment
and
since
the
commissioner
at
the
time
of
the
revenue
act
of
1926,
which
included
this
provision,
had
three
years
to
assess
in
certain
cases
and
four
years
in
others,
it
is
now
three
years,
i
might
add
under
the
1939
code.
and
since
where
the
taxpayer
files
no
return,
as
was
the
case
here,
the
commissioner
has
no
statute
of
limitations
upon
assessment,
that
it
was
unfair
in
the
case
of
a
taxpayer
who
was
acknowledging
liability,
to
require
him
to
wait
until
the
taxpayer
finished
his
administrative
processing
of
the
case
and
issued
a
90-day
letter
and
following
it,
an
assessment.
it
was
unfair
that
such
a
taxpayer
require
him
to
pay
interest
during
this
entire
period
when
he
had
no
desire
to
contest
at
this
point.
theoretically,
under
the
code,
as
it
existed,
if
the
commissioner
waited
for
the
three
year
period
before
he
proceeded
to
issue
a
90-day
letter,
the
taxpayer
would
be
liable
for
three
years
interest
at
6%
percent
per
year,
or
here
where
there
was
no
return
file,
that
the
commissioner
waited
five
or
six
years
before
he
finally
--
an
investigation
disclose
this
deficiency,
by
then
the
tax,
the
interest
would
be
30%,
36%
on
of
--
at
6%
a
year.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
taxpayer
could,
of
course,
make
a
voluntary
payment.
the
question
was
whether
that
voluntary
payment
would
stop
running
of
interest
against
the
taxpayer
prior
to
an
assessment.
it
is
the
taxpayer's
position
here.
he
provides
and
states
that
the
problem
was
at
that
time
and
it
was
assumed
by
congress
when
it
enacted
this
waiver
provision
that
a
voluntary
payment
might
not
stop
the
running
of
interest
because
there
was
no
assessment,
and
in
that
event,
it
would
not
be
a
payment
of
the
tax.
consequently,
the
problem
as
envisioned
at
that
time
was
to
provide
for
immediate
assessment,
to
give
the
taxpayer
some
way
of
being
assured
interest
was
stopped
by
giving
him
a
means
for
consenting
to
assessment
at
once,
without
any
of
these
restrictions.
you
remember
under
the
code,
commissioner
could
not
assess
until
he
furnished
this
letter,
then
he
had
to
wait
for
full
90
days
or
60
days
that
it
originally
was.
during
this
entire
period,
interest
ran
whether
the
taxpayer
was
willing
to
settle
his
dispute
with
the
government
or
not.
the
intention
was
to
provide
some
means
whereby
the
taxpayer
in
that
position
could
stop
the
running
of
interest
and
the
waiver
provision
here
was
tied
in
with
a
--
an
amendment
enacted
at
the
same
time
which
provided
that
the
waiver
should
have
the
effect
of
stopping
interest,
30
days
after
it
was
filed
or
if
an
assessment
followed
whichever
period
was
sooner,
so
that
a
taxpayer
was
not
desiring
the
contest
on
that,
he
could
file
a
waiver,
and
interest
stopped,
30
days
later,
no
matter
how
long
it
took
the
commissioner
to
get
around
to
formally
assessing
the
tax.
he
was
afforded
that
protection
and
he
could
stop
interest
without
himself
losing
the
use
of
the
money,
which
would
be
required,
of
course,
if
he
made
a
voluntary
payment.
the
theory
being
until
such
time
as
the
assessment
followed,
there
was
no
payment
of
the
tax,
the
taxpayer
should
not
lose
his
right
to
this
money.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
first
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
both
held
at
the
waiver
is
effective.
now,
the
--
when
you
view
this
enactment
in
terms
of
the
desire
to
prevent
the
running
of
interest
against
the
taxpayer,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
position
that
taxpayer
takes
here
nullifies
that
intention.
the
taxpayer
says
that
the
waiver
is
no
good
until
the
90-day
letter
issues.
at
that
time,
he
may
waive
and
stop
interest
30
days
later.
well,
of
course,
the
--
or
the
commissioner
has
three
years
to
issue
the
90-day
letter
or
in
the
case
of
no
return,
an
unlimited
period
to
issue
the
90-day
letter,
and
once
the
90-day
letter
is
issued
and
the
whole
administrative
procedure
has
culminated
in
this
90-day
letter,
for
the
taxpayer
then
to
waive
and
stop
interest
30
days
later,
gives
him
really
the
benefit
of
a
savings
perhaps
of
30
days
interest,
because
originally,
the
commissioner
was
prohibited
from
assessing
for
a
period
of
60
days
following
the
statutory
letter,
so
that
under
the
taxpayer's
view,
the
commissioner
who
before
was
restricted
for
60
days
from
assessing
and,
therefore,
interest
run
during
this
60-day
period
under
the
taxpayer's
view
here,
the
waiver
filed
after
this
60-day
letter
was
sent
would
stop
interest
30
days
later.
so
the
net
benefit
to
the
taxpayer
is
30
days
of
interest
plus
on
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
they
--
i
don't
think,
there's
any
dispute
between
the
parities
at
the
intention
of
enacting
this
waiver
provision
was
to
stop
the
running
of
interest.
the
real
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
that
--
at
the
time
that
this
provision
was
enacted,
the
tax
--
the
board
--
then
the
board
of
tax
appeals
was
also
given
jurisdiction
to
determine
overpayments
of
tax
and
the
original
draft
of
this
section
to
which
the
committee
report
refers
contained
the
sentence
which
provided
that
the
taxpayer
filed
a
waiver.
he
could
still
have
an
overpayment
determined
by
the
board
of
tax
appeals.
we
say
that
the
language
in
this
committee
report
is
simply
designed
to
indicate
that
where
the
taxpayer
gets
to
the
tax
court
and
files
the
waiver,
in
which
case,
the
tax
would
presumably
be
collected,
he
does
not
lose
his
right
to
stay
there
because
the
tax
court
has
been
given
power
to
determine
an
overpayment
of
tax.
now,
viewed
in
that
context,
this
language
is
at
the
least,
equivocal.
it
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
balance
of
the
statute
which
provided
that
the
tax
court,
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
could
declare
overpayments.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
well,
he
can't
get
there
if
there
isn't
a
90-day
letter
and
we
say
he
shouldn't
get
there
because
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tax
court
has
always
been
based
on
the
taxpayer's
controverting
the
assertion
of
the
deficiency.
ours
is
a
self
assessment
system.
the
concept
of
a
deficiency,
as
defined
in
the
code,
is
premised
upon
the
assertion
of
an
additional
tax
by
the
commissioner,
which
the
taxpayer
is
disputing
prior
to
payment.
so,
for
example,
if
the
taxpayer
files
a
tax
return
admitting
so
many
dollars
of
tax
due,
he's
not
entitled
to
a
90-day
letter.
that
maybe
assessed
immediately,
the
definition
of
deficiency
in
the
code
provides
that
similarly
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
if
the
taxpayer
files
a
tax
return
and
shows
so
much
tax
due
on
the
return,
does
not
pay
at
this
time,
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
90-day
letter.
the
commissioner
may
assess
that
tax
immediately.
this
is
an
acknowledged
liability.
despite
the
fact
the
taxpayer
may
sue
for
refund
at
a
later
time,
for
present
purposes,
he
is
not
contesting
payment.
now,
we
say
that
the
waiver
here
is
simply
another
technique
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
for
him
to
indicate
that.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
to
say
that
the
taxpayer
who
files
a
return
showing
so
much
tax
due
is
not
contesting
liability,
this
is
true
so
far
as
all
appearance
are
concerned.
but
he,
of
course,
is
not
bound
by
that.
he
may
sue
for
refund
at
a
later
time.
the
question
is
whether
he
is
contesting
payment
of
an
asserted
tax,
if
he
is
contesting
payment,
why
then
he
ought
to
go
to
the
tax
court,
because
the
route
was
provided
for
just
that
situation.
if
he
is
not
contesting
payment,
he
should
not
go
to
the
tax
court
despite
the
fact
that
he
may
be
disputing
the
correct
amount
of
the
tax.
for
example,
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
have
both
held
that
where
the
taxpayer
filed
a
return
which
shows
so
much
due
and
then
decides
on
his
own,
that
he
owes
more
tax
or
at
least,
he
thinks
an
agent
will
propose
additional
tax
and
makes
a
payment
of
that
sum
to
the
director,
he
has
lost
the
right
to
go
to
the
tax
court.
there's
no
need
to
issue
a
90-day
letter.
now,
this
is
not
because
the
taxpayer
will
never
dispute
that
he
owes
this
money.
it's
because
he
is
not
presently
controverting
the
commissioner's
right
to
collect
the
tax.
now,
we
say
here,
when
he
files
a
waiver
of
this
kind,
which
says,
“i
consent
to
assessment
and
collection
of
the
tax.”
similarly
under
our
self
assessment
system,
he
is
not
presently
controverting
the
payment
of
the
tax,
and
therefore,
there
is
no
reason
to
treat
him
any
differently
from
the
taxpayer
who
files
an
amended
return,
showing
more
due
from
the
taxpayer
who
makes
a
voluntary
payment
of
this
kind
prior
to
a
90-day
letter.
he
decides
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
taxpayer
who
pays
prior
to
the
90-day
letter,
at
least,
has
given
the
government
of
the
use
of
the
money.
he
still
has
lost
of
his
right
to
go
to
the
tax
court.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
would
have
to
sue
for
a
refund.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
after
the
tax
had
been
collected,
or
if
the
tax
were
being
collected
as
in
a
collection
action
of
this
kind,
he
might
attempt
to
raise
the
merits
of
this
case.
now,
that
was
not
done
here.
the
taxpayer
has
no
time
in
the
lower
court
although
having
had
the
full
opportunity
to
do
so,
raise
any
question
that
there
was
a
defense
to
the
merits
of
this
assessment.
so
he
did
not
avail
himself
of
such
an
opportunity.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i'd
like
to
quote
from
the
respondent's
statement
of
the
problem
which
gave
rise
to
the
statute
under
consideration.
he
says,
this
prohibition
is
referring
to
the
prohibitions
against
assessment
created
a
problem
for
the
taxpayer
who
did
not
wish
to
file
a
petition
in
the
tax
court
within
the
90
days
but
who
desire
that
interest
stopped
running
on
a
deficiency.
we
agree
with
that
and
we
say
the
way
that
taxpayer
stopped
interest
from
running
on
a
deficiency
was
by
filing
the
waiver
without
waiting
for
the
90-day
letter.
if
by
hypothesis,
he
doesn't
want
to
go
to
the
tax
court,
why
do
we
have
to
send
him
on
and
insist
that
he
pay
interest
during
that
entire
interval?
that
is
what
the
position
of
the
government
comes
down
to
in
this
case.
now,
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
a
notice
of
deficiency,
which
is
the
90-day
letter
and
the
deficiency
itself.
that's
made
very
clear
in
the
statute
which
defines
deficiency
in
tax
--
in
section
271.
as
used
in
this
chapter,
deficiency
mean
the
amount
by
which
the
tax
imposed
exceed
the
excess
of
the
amount
shown
on
the
return,
the
amounts
previously
assessed,
and
this
would
be
an
amount
previously
assessed,
or
the
amounts
previously
collected
without
assessment
as
where
the
taxpayer
pays
voluntarily.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
the
other
provisions
clearly
distinguish
the
notice
itself.
the
deficiency
is
simply
the
liability
which
the
act
itself
creates,
it
doesn't
matter
who
determines
it.
it
may
never
be
found
out
but
the
deficiency
is
there.
it
is
the
true
liability
of
the
taxpayer
less
what
he
has
acknowledged
his
--
his
tax.
for
example,
272
(c)
provides
that
the
taxpayer
does
not
file
a
petition
in
the
tax
court,
the
deficiency,
notice
of
which
has
been
mailed
to
him
shall
be
assessed
which
clearly
distinguishes
the
deficiency
itself
from
the
notice.
the
very
section
we're
discussing
here
distinguishes
it.
it
says,
“no
assessment
of
a
deficiency
shall
be
made
until
notice
has
been
mailed
to
the
taxpayer.”
so,
the
deficiency
is
a
concept
entirely
distinct
from
the
notice.
and
it's
the
government
that
is
relying
on
the
definition
as
contained
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
when
the
waiver
provision
says
you
may
waive
restrictions
on
the
deficiency,
the
deficiency
is
not
a
notice
of
deficiency
it
is
the
liability
which
is
created
by
the
statute
less
the
offsets
such
as
whatever
is
acknowledged
on
the
return
or
has
been
previously
collected.
the
entire
administrative
process,
the
internal
revenue
service,
from
the
moment
an
agent
appears
on
the
premises
to
examine
the
return
is
designed
to
procure
one
of
two
results,
either
to
procure
agreement
from
the
taxpayer
that
he
will
pay
the
proposed
additional
amount
of
tax.
in
which
case
the
taxpayer
signs
an
870
to
stop
the
running
of
interest,
because
since
he's
already
agreed
to
pay
this
amount,
there
is
no
reason
to
go
forward
with
the
rest
of
the
administrative
procedure
and
provide
him
with
a
90-day
letter
or
if
the
taxpayer
does
not
agree
to
the
proposal,
he
has
successive
layers
of
review
within
the
internal
revenue
service,
he
can
go
to
a
group
chief.
he
can
file
--
get
a
30-day
letter
and
protest
and
go
to
the
appellate
division
which
is
part
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
if
all
of
these
means
avail
not
to
reach
a
settlement
of
the
dispute,
he
receives
a
90-day
letter,
so
that
he
can
go
to
the
tax
court
if
he
wants
to.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
precisely.
the
notice
is
the
identification
by
which
the
taxpayer
can
go
to
the
tax
court
and
dispute
something
alleged
by
the
commissioner
as
due
over
and
above
that,
which
he
has
acknowledged
is
due
on
his
return
or
in
some
other
way
as
by
the
waiver.
but
at
every
stage
of
the
administrative
process
as
these
--
these
literally
thousands
and
thousands
of
controversies
between
agents
and
taxpayers
are
resolved,
at
every
stage
the
taxpayer's
afforded
an
opportunity,
if
he
agrees
with
the
proposed
additional
tax,
to
sign
a
waiver
that
closes
the
case
out.
there
is
no
need
to
go
to
the
tax
court;
there
is
no
need
to
issue
a
90-day
letter.
we're
stopping
the
running
of
interest
on
behalf
of
the
taxpayer
because
the
government
can
immediately
collect
it
and
if
the
government
can
collect
it,
then
there's
nothing
to
take
to
the
tax
court
because
there
is
no
deficiency.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
well
that
is
the
difference
between
the
two
routes
congress
has
established
to
contest
tax
liability.
now,
there's
no
question
here
as
respondents
seem
to
imply
of
whether
the
taxpayer
understood
this
waiver.
he
had
full
opportunity
below
and
the
district
court
to
raise
any
question
of
a
stopple
of
misrepresentation
of
anything
which
would
impair
the
binding
effects
of
the
waiver.
that
was
not
done;
there
is
no
question
of
that
sort
at
all
in
this
case.
as
the
government
sees
that
the
only
question
here
is
construction
of
the
statute
and
whether
when
congress
said
that
no
assessment
shall
be
made
until
a
notice
has
been
mailed
whether
that
notice
is
not
a
restriction
which
the
taxpayer
can
waive.
now,
we
say
it
is
clear
under
the
statute
that
that
is
a
restriction
that
the
taxpayer
can
waive.
now,
the
respondent
has
also
referred
to
a
committee
report
of
1938
which
indicates
that
these
cases
in
the
ninth
circuit
had
held,
there
was
an
invalid
waiver.
committee
also
said,
“your
subcommittee,
while
feeling
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
already
sufficiently
clear,
feels
compelled
to
do
precisely
what
was
done
in
the
1954
code
just
to
make
sure.”
