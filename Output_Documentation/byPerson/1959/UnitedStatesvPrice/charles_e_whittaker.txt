30-day
letter
and
after
we
begin
to
protest
in
advance
of
the
receipt
of
the
90-day
letter.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
only
one
thing
that
bothers
me
(inaudible)
what
was
the
presented
taxpayer,
that
maybe
involved
here,
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
what
would
be
--
what
in
the
world
is
the
purpose
of
that
precluding
if
after
the
90
days
have
expired
and
the
assessment
has
been
made?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible),
the
taxpayer
receives
a
90-day
letter
on
january
1.
on
that
day,
he
signed
his
waiver
and
returned
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
commissioner
upon
receipt,
may
make
the
assessment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
by
the
waiver,
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
therefore,
if
payment
is
made,
he
would
stop.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
did
just
that
--
and
you
--
you
signed
the
waiver,
but
you
didn't
pay?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible),
i
think
that
maybe
so
with
respect
to
this
assessment,
but
is
it
not
entirely
due
to
the
fact
that
you
consented
to
the
assessment?
otherwise,
you
would've
gotten
the
90-day
letter,
but
when
you
consented
to
the
making
of
the
assessment,
did
you
not
thereby
waive
any
efficacy
or
need
to
the
issuance
of
the
90-day
letter?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
it
says
in
so
many
words
exactly
just
that,
does
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
december
31,
1946,
income
(inaudible)
$9965.48.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
(inaudible).
now
it
was
indeed
after
that,
they
send
you
a
90-day
letter,
so
as
you
might
contest
it
in
the
tax
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
should
in
effect,
they
have
a
right
to
make
an
agreement
--
contract
that
they
won't
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
why
would
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
(inaudible)
that
no
exemptions
maybe
made
if
the
90-day
letter
was
given,
until
after
the
90
days
had
expired
and
not
even
then
until
if
the
proceeding
has
been
brought
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
still
don't
understand
why,
when
you
have
a
notice,
a
90-day
notice
when
you
have
considered
to
the
--
and
if
only
relevant
for
difference
which
you
have
to
make,
it
would
have
been
you
would
have
got
the
90-day
letter,
since
you
wouldn't
have
it
due
to
litigate
in
a
court's
action.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
don't
question
about
that,
you
can
pay
stopping
interest,
the
next
day
buy
reclaim
for
refund
when
and
it's
denied
six
months
expire
whichever
first
occurs
to
(inaudible)
your
money
back.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
must
--
there
must
be
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
is
you
give
--
receive
30-day
letter
and
you
have
a
negotiation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
are
making
perhaps
another
fact
that
if
the
deficiency
was
there,
all
the
notice
does
is
to
identify
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
doesn't
that
mean
--
but
does
it
mean
that
(inaudible)
claim
for
refund
which
he
filed
the
next
day
--
