justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
bernhard,
do
i
correctly
understand
however,
that
your
dispute
here
is
over
a
principle
and
not
over
detailed
facts.
as
i
understand,
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
because
i
want
to
understand,
you
contend
that
the
depreciation
is
to
be
taken
over
the
useful
life
of
the
asset
as
an
asset
and
you
argue
that
the
government
contends
that
the
depreciation
should
be
taken
only
over
the
holding
period
by
the
particular
taxpayer
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
without
regard
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
heffron,
is
it
not
essential
here
in
this
matter
to
bear
in
mind
the
distinction
between
depreciation
and
depletion
in
answering
mr.
justice
black's
question?
or,
he
spoke
about
the
27%
depletion
of
oil?
you
do
have
other
depletion
statutes
with
respect
to
stumpage,
coal,
other
things,
do
you
not?
but
they
do
not
apply
to
depreciation
and
that's
your
answer?

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
bernhard,
might
--
might
i
ask
you,
sir,
why
is
it
you
--
that
you
feel
you
want
to
distinguish
your
cases
from
massey?
