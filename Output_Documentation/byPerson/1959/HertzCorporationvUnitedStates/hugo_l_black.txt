justice

l.
black
is
it
printed
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know
the
page
--
you
don't
know
the
page
number?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
any
part
of
it
printed
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it's
your
contention,
i'm
--
i'm
just
asking
because
i
don't
know.
the
bulletin
“f”
sets
out
an
inflexible
decision
of
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
that
you
can
follow
and
depend
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
understood
you
to
say
four-year
life,
which
accountants
and
taxpayers,
has
considered.
did
you
have
any
evidence
to
show
that
the
four-year
life
was
an
actual
--
actual
life
of
your
cars?
i'm
not
talking
about
potential
life
or
accountants'
life,
but
the
actual
life.
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
correct
in
assuming
from
that,
that
your
argument
is
that
you're
entitled
to
a
greater
depreciation
and
actually
a
term
and
that
the
government
contends
that
it
--
you're
only
entitled
to
the
depreciation
which
actually
does
occur
from
wear
and
tear.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
out
here,
i'm
here
i'm
talking
about
(inaudible).
that
in
your
instance
--
that
in
your
instance,
it
results
and
you're
getting
greater
than
actually
appears?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
without
regard
to
whether
at
the
end
of
that
four
years,
it
would
be
worth
90%
of
its
whole
value
or
worth
just
10%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
result
--
the
result
is
that
it's
charged
off
as
a
whole
within
four
years
time
even
though
it
might
actually
be
useful
to
somebody
15
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
charged
off
--
it's
charged
off,
so
that
at
the
end
of
four
years,
you
start
from
nothing
as
its
value,
although
it
might
be
worth
a
$1000.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
the
government
is
committed
to
that
by
reason
of
its
practices
and
the
regulation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
the
government
could
do
that,
could
offer
proof
to
show
that.
but
it
hasn't
--
is
that
what
i
understand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
is
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
those
the
old
regulations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
has
the
other
side
presented
in
the
evidence
of
a
long
practice
under
which
the
government
has
lead
people
to
believe
that
the
method
they
wished
to
use
of
artificial
depletion
or
depreciation
has
been
carried
on
by
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
one
other
question.
i
don't
know.
the
congress
has
in
the
case
of
oil
depletion,
allowed
what
many
people
considered
to
be
deductions
so
far
wear
and
tear
or
depreciation
which
not
actually
suffered
just
on
the
basis
of
arbitrary
figures.
has
congress
done
that
in
any
other
emphasis
that
you
know
of?
i'm
asking
for
information.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
--
has
the
department
any
regulation
on
the
books
that
you
know
of
where
they
have
fixed
artificial
--
artificial
--
the
amount
of
depletion
or
depreciation
sucked
and
allowed
deductions
on
it.
inflexible
rules,
i
don't
know.
i'm
asking
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
outside
of
the
oil
statute,
do
you
know
of
any
statute
or
--
i'm
asking
you
this
for
information.
i
do
not
know.
any
statute
or
regulation
or
practice
under
which
government
has
allowed
depreciation
and
--
and
a
wear
and
tear
which
is
not
actually
suffered
so
that
people
get
depreciations
and
deductions
in
a
greater
amount
than
the
amount
actually
sustained.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
referred
to
that
as
the
one
that
would
show
that
they
had
been
making
these
reports
over
a
certain
period
of
years.
i
must
have
gotten
the
page
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
114.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
--
what
page
is
that?
what
page
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
where
is
the
evidence
to
which
you
referred
they'd
been
making
this
same
kind
of
return
and
has
been
accepted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
--
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
give
us
later,
if
you
can
find
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
give
us
later
if
you
can
find
it,
references
to
the
kind
of
interpretation
which
have
been
mentioned
here,
not
using
the
word,
“useful
life”,
but
which
showed
that
the
treasury
has
had
the
practice
of
allowing
people
whether
what
you
call
a
useful
life
for
four
years,
even
more
of
that
with
wholly
charge
off
something
it
left
them
who
had
paid
probably
of
50%
value.
can
you
refer
us
to
such
interpretations
you
say
there
have
been?
can
you
refer
us
to
them,
when
you
send
them
the
other
information?
