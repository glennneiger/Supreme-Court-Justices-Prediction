mr.
bernhard,
many
things
about
this
case
is
about
which
i
need
enlightenment,
but
i
haven't
heard
you
say
anything
yet
about
double
declining
balance
method.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

someone
will.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
hope
someone's
going
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

it's
your
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
heffron,
along
the
same
line
and
that
was
in
104
of
the
--
page
104
of
the
record
has
apparently
--
or
j.
frank
connor
which
was
the
predecessor
of
hertz
before
the
mergers.
it
must
have
done
something
about
this
on
its
tax
returns
ending
march
31,
1948
to
march
31,
1953.
each
cases
start
from
the
tax
years
ending
march
31,
1954,
1955
and
1956.
now,
is
the
--
connor
follow
the
same
practice
in
the
earlier
years
they
followed
--
and
the
three
years
we
have
before
us
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
government
never
challenged
it
from
1948
to
--
to
1954?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bernhard,
at
page
111
of
the
hertz
statute,
as
part
of
judge
leighton's
opinion,
there's
a
table
preceded
by
the
statement
of
judge
leighton
on
its
income's
tax
returns
for
its
tax
years
and
so
forth,
connor
claimed
the
following
amounts
computed
as
indicated
that
he
has
a
table
and
that
he
--
has
this
some
reference
to
the
way
they
return
themselves
who
have
filled
out
in
that
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
on
each
return
that
there
appear
in
that
column,
four-year
life
using
rates
of
and
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no.
but
my
point
is
did
the
hertz's
return
or
the
connor
return
have
a
table
which
shows
the
--
that
method
of
computation,
namely,
the
expressed
reference
of
the
four-year
life?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
if
--
if
that
is
not
so,
do
you
know
whether
the
returns
themselves
indicated
that
the
computation
was
based
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
so
notified
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
review
on
a
four-year
life
basis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
--
if
i
may,
and
supplementing
what
mr.
justice
black
has
asked
you.
is
there
anything
in
the
record,
if
this
is
what
appeared
on
each
annual
return
namely,
expressed
notice
that
you
are
using
a
four-year
life
basis?
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
this
was
done
for
tax
years
before
1954?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whether
they
followed
it
or
not,
what
i'm
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
i
am
interested
in
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
whether
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
appeared
affirmatively
on
the
returns
that
the
computation
was
based
on
four-year
life.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
can
you
give
it
to
us
later?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
completely
have
to
see
in
these
cases.
