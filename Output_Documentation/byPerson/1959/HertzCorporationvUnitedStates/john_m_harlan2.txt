what
case
it
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
are
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
there
is
a
dispute
between
you
as
to
what
the
significance
of
--
in
the
business
is.
they
say
as
i
understand
it
that
that
simply
is
a
description
of
the
character
of
assets
and
they're
subject
to
117
jail,
whatever
it
is,
treatment
and
you
say
it
means
holding
period
as
descriptive
of
useful
life.
your
arguments,
it
seems
to
me,
completely
bypass
each
other.
there
are
arguments
from
the
standpoint
of
administrative
practice
and
what
they
argue
is
the
law,
your
argument
from
what
you
conceive
to
be
sound
economic
theory
and
you
haven't
met
each
other
on
either
premise.
justice
john
m.
harlan
good.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
that
kind
of
a
controversy
concern
what
the
proper
physical
useful
life
is,
not
the
case
you
have
here
where
you
don't
dispute
the
physical
useful
life,
but
claim
that
the
period
of
useful
life
in
terms
of
the
use
in
the
business
of
the
taxpayers
are
not
shown
to
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
put
the
question
that
was
asked
you,
if
i
understand
it
correctly
from
mr.
--
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
a
little
differently.
until
these
cases
came
along,
had
you
previously
--
had
the
government
previously
claimed
--
objected
to
hertz
reporting
on
a
physical
useful
life
basis?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
on
any
of
the
--
any
of
the
cases
of
these
three
taxpayers.
