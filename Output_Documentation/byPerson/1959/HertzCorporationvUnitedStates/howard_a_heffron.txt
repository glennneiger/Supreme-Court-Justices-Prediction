mr.
howard
a.
heffron
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
first
advert
to
the
touchstone
in
this
area
and
that
is
cost.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
depreciation
deduction
is
to
ascertain
what
the
cost
of
the
use
of
the
physical
asset
has
been
to
the
taxpayer
during
the
year,
because
by
using
that
asset,
he
has
produced
income.
the
taxes
imposed
are
net
income
and
so,
we
must
deduct
his
cost
from
his
income.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
wear
and
tear
in
the
air
or
in
the
abstract.
we
are
dealing
with
the
financial
figure
to
be
ascribed
to
wear
and
tear
for
the
purposes
of
computing
the
taxpayer's
net
income.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
congress
might
have
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
intend
to
get
to
the
regulations
and
the
practice.
the
basis
for
my
statement
that
cost
is
the
touchstone
here
is
the
statute
which
this
--
which
states
that
depreciation
shall
be
based
upon
cost.
cost
is
the
basis
of
the
asset
which
is
used
as
the
measure
of
the
depreciation.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
no
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
would
conceive
that
if
congress
said
give
depreciation
without
recourse
to
cost,
without
any
relevance
to
cost
as
it
is
done
in
the
field
of
percentage
depletion,
that
then,
of
course,
cost
would
be
an
irrelevant
factor,
but
congress
hasn't
done
that.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
i
--
i
was
going
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
think
that's
right,
but
we're
talking
--
if
we're
talking
simply
in
terms
of
a
rate
and
we're
talking
about
a
rate
which
when
applied
aggregates
cost,
what
point
is
it
to
base
that
rate
upon
factors
which
are
wholly
unrelated
to
the
period
the
taxpayer
will
use
the
asset
or
what
he
receives
when
he
finishes
with
the
asset.
why
would
a
rate
be
meaningful?
we
would
suggest
if
that
rate
is
predicated
on
a
period
of
years,
the
asset
is
used
in
the
taxpayer's
business,
if
among
the
factors
to
be
ascertained
in
determining
the
rate
is
the
mode
of
operation
of
the
taxpayer,
how
hard
he
uses
the
machine,
the
climate.
why
would
we
base
the
period
of
time
which
is
in
terms,
the
measure
of
the
rate
on
all
this
factors
which
are
personal
to
the
taxpayer's
operating
situation,
if
we're
not
concerned
that
that
period
of
time
be
--
produce
such
a
rate
that
when
aggregated,
cost
will
be
recovered.
i
mean
that
is
--
that
is
essentially
our
point
here.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
say
that
the
asset
will
be
used
10
years
by
someone
and
therefore,
the
rate
should
be
10%,
if,
in
fact,
you
know
the
taxpayer
will
only
use
the
asset
five
years
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
because
then
the
aggregate
10%
only
equals
50%
and
we're
looking
for
a
rate
which
when
aggregated
equals
a
100%
of
the
taxpayer's
cost.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
regulation
states
in
terms
that
the
proper
allowance
for
depreciation
is
an
amount
which
when
aggregated
over
the
useful
life
of
the
property
in
the
business,
equals
cost.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
now,
we
say
useful
life
there
means
just
what
the
regulation
says,
useful
life
of
the
property
in
the
business,
because
if
it
meant
anything
else,
you
would
not
be
recovering
cost
and
the
purpose
of
the
deduction
is
to
enable
the
taxpayer
to
recover
cost,
if
the
rate
is
based
on
factors
which
have
no
bearing
and
no
relationship
to
the
taxpayer's
business,
there
is
no
guaranty,
there
is
no
probability.
there
is
no
likelihood
that
the
imposition
of
the
rate
when
aggregated
during
the
term
the
taxpayer
holds
the
property
will
result
in
100%.
as
where
the
taxpayer
determines,
10%
to
be
the
rate,
because
this
abstract
model
is
10
years,
but
he
using
it
five
years.
you
add
five-10%
equals
50%.
and
we
say
when
you
know
the
taxpayer
will
only
hold
it
five
years,
you
cannot
use
a
10%
rate.
you
have
to
use
a
--
such
a
rate
which
will
give
back
cost
to
the
taxpayer.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
think
we're
going
to
meet
directly
in
the
next
few
minutes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
have
also
had
trouble
in
understanding
what
the
taxpayer's
conception
of
useful
life
is
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i've
just
called
at
random,
a
few
of
the
different
terms
he
uses
to
describe
it
and
he
calls
it
whole
life,
overall
life,
business
life,
economic
life,
inherent
functional
life,
normal
useful
life,
inherent
physical
life,
physical
life
and
economic
physical
life.
now,
those
terms
can
be,
i
suppose,
made
to
bear
any
meaning
the
taxpayer
cares
to
place
upon
them.
the
one
concession
we
have
extracted
from
the
taxpayer
here,
which
i
think
is
decisive,
is
that
we're
dealing
with
economic
life.
now,
economic
life
presumes
that
there
will
be
factors
taken
into
account
other
than
the
engineering
factor
of
physical
deterioration
of
the
property.
there
will
be
factors
other
than
physical
deterioration,
economic
factors.
one
of
those
economic
factors
we
call
obsolescence.
other
factors,
we
call
inadequacy
for
use
in
the
taxpayer's
business,
supersession
by
invention
or
technological
changes,
changes
in
consumer
demands.
these
are
--
there
are
a
host
of
economic
factors
and
it
is
those
economic
factors
to
which
i
should
like
to
make
reference
now,
because
it
has
been
quite
clear
from
the
outset
that
economic
factors
other
than
wear
and
tear,
economic
factors
peculiar
to
the
taxpayer's
business
are
factors
which
must
be
taken
into
account.
now,
in
particular
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
i'm
referring
to
regulations
which
date
back
from
the
earliest
times.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
in
1954,
they
were
changed,
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
i've
--
well,
they're
more
specifically,
the
1954
regulations
are
clearly
and
directly
in
support
of
the
position
we're
advocating
here,
but
i
was
not
going
to
refer
to
the
1954
regulations,
because
i
don't
think
we
have
to
rely
on
a
bootstrap
argument.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
i
was
not.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
i
--
i've
been
accountable
at
that,
but
right
now
my
thesis
is
that
he
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
sir.
i
have
not
--
i
was
not
referring
to
that
particular
segment
of
bulletin
“f”,
but
i
will
make
reference
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
our
regulations
which
have
--
which
have
been
with
us
since
the
revenue
act
of
1918.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
think
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
regulations
from
the
time
that
the
depreciation
deduction
was
put
in
other
statute
are
significant.
and
i
think
that
all
of
them
show
that
from
the
outset,
economic
factors
other
than
physical
deterioration
were
all
considered
as
relevant
in
determining
useful
life
and
they
are
economic
factors
which
are
dependent
upon
an
analysis
of
the
taxpayer's
business
alone.
now,
the
regulations,
for
example,
from
the
start
have
said,
with
respect
to
depreciation
in
the
case
of
tangible
property,
it
applies
to
that
which
is
subject
to
wear
and
tear
from
natural
causes
and
to
obsolescence
due
to
the
normal
progress
of
the
art
or
the
becoming
inadequate
to
the
growing
needs
of
the
business.
now,
there
is
an
indication
that
there
are
economic
factors
which
must
be
taken
into
account.
now,
that
has
always
been
in
the
regulations
and
the
commissioner
has
always
taken
the
position
that
economic
factors
are
to
be
taken
into
account.
i'd
like
to
advert
to
bulletin
“f”,
if
i
may
for
a
minute.
and
bulletin
“f”
says,
with
respect
to
depreciation,
“past
experience
furnishes
a
reliable
guide
for
the
determination
of
the
useful
life
of
the
property.
such
a
determination
should
reflect
all
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
use
or
operation
of
the
property
such
as
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
utilized.
the
conditions
under
which
it
used
or
operated,
the
policy
as
to
repairs
with
new
rules
and
improvements
in
the
climatic
and
other
local
conditions.”
now,
on
the
salvage
value,
bulletin
“f”
has
said,
“salvage
value
is
the
amount
realizable
from
the
sale
or
other
disposition
of
the
items
recovered
when
property
has
become
no
longer
useful
in
the
taxpayer's
business.”
now,
all
of
these
factors
are
geared.
they
are
keys
to
an
analysis
of
economic
factors
which
bear
upon
the
way
the
taxpayer
operates
his
business.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
those
regulations
have
been
in
effect
and
substantially
that
form
since
1918.
the
whole
concept
of
obsolescence
has
been
one
which
has
been
adopted
by
this
court
in
situations
which
while
precisely
the
same
facts
were
not
presented,
this
was
by
analogy,
the
principle
was
directly
applicable
in
the
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1932,
u.s.
cartridge
company
against
the
united
states.
the
taxpayer
had
built
an
ammunition
plant
in
1914
on
property
which
he
leased.
the
lease
ran
until
1924
at
which
time
he
would
have
to
leave
the
premises
and
leave
the
building
there,
of
course.
he
had
never
been
in
a
business
of
making
military
ammunition
and
did
this
as
part
of
the
war
effort.
when
the
war
terminated
in
1918,
he
had
no
more
orders
and
he
sought
to
take
a
large
deduction
for
obsolescence
of
his
plant
in
that
year.
there
is
no
question
that
this
plant
physically,
which
had
been
built
new
in
1914,
as
an
abstract
proposition
had
many,
many
years
to
run
both
beyond
the
end
of
the
war
and
beyond
the
termination
of
the
lease.
the
commissioner
contended
not
as
he
would
have
contended
had
taxpayer's
theory
been
correct.
he
did
not
contend
that
depreciation
or
--
was
to
be
allowed
over
the
period
of
the
abstract
model
life
of
a
factory,
let
us
say
50
years
or
40
years.
he
contended
that
the
cost
of
the
plant
should
be
taken
over
the
unremaining
period
of
the
lease.
that
is
until
1924.
now,
why
did
he
choose
1924
as
the
terminus?
because
that
was
the
period
when
the
taxpayer's
holding
period
ended
and
he
--
he
also
contended
that
the
taxpayer
should
not
take
obsolescence
in
1918
because
it's
a
factual
matter.
it
has
not
been
demonstrated
that
he
could
no
longer
use
the
plant
for
any
commercial,
whatever.
but
the
principle
was
the
--
the
principle
which
the
commissioner
supported
was
the
principle
that
the
holding
period
of
the
taxpayer
is
one
of
the
essential
factors
in
determining
the
useful
life
of
property
to
him.
now,
this
bulletin
“f”,
for
example,
in
another
analogous
situation,
provides
with
respect
to
bridges
that
the
useful
life
of
a
bridge
shall
be
so
many
years
unless
otherwise
limited
by
a
franchise.
now
again,
the
purpose
of
limiting
it
to
a
franchise
is
because
this
limits
the
taxpayer's
holding
period
of
the
property
and
to
base
a
rate
of
depreciation
upon
a
period
which
went
beyond
the
franchise,
would
not
provide
that
the
aggregate
amounts
during
the
period
of
the
taxpayer's
holding
of
the
property
that
is,
the
franchise
period,
would
equal
the
amount
of
the
cost
he
had
incurred.
now,
these
have
always
been
in
bulletin
“f”,
the
feature
with
respect
to
the
lease
that
i
mentioned
is
also
in
bulletin
“f”
when
it
talks
about
furniture
and
fixtures
in
certain
retail
businesses,
where
it
says
that
the
normal
average
useful
life
shall
be
so
much,
unless
otherwise
limited
by
the
term
of
the
lease.
now,
the
purpose
again
of
limiting
it
to
the
lease
is
because
that
limits
the
holding
period
of
the
taxpayer.
and
again,
mathematically,
you
will
not
aggregate
cost
if
you
based
the
rate
on
a
period
which
is
not
coextensive
with
the
actual
facts,
with
the
period
the
taxpayer
will
be
using
the
property.
the
regulations
have
always
provided
with
respect
to
the
depreciation
of
mining
equipment.
that
mining
equipment
shall
be
depreciated
for
their
abstract
normal
useful
life,
unless
the
mineral
deposit
will
wear
out,
will
be
terminated,
will
no
longer
be
useful
in
a
shorter
period.
if
that
is
so,
in
that
event,
the
taxpayer
will
depreciate
his
mining
equipment
over
the
shorter
period,
over
the
economic
life
of
the
property.
now,
in
many
of
those
cases,
both
the
mining
equipment
is
theoretically
usable.
an
engineer
could
analyze
it
and
say,
“well,
it's
got
so
many
more
years
of
abuse
left.”
and
the
reason
we're
not
interested
in
that
is
because
we
are
solely
interested
in
returning
to
the
taxpayer
his
cost.
we
are
not
interested
in
wear
and
tear
in
the
abstract.
and
you
can
see
that
in
the
normal
application
of
straight
line
depreciation.
even
on
the
taxpayer's
theory,
he
takes
25%
in
the
first
year.
well
now,
i'm
sure
that
engineering
studies
would
show
that
the
actual
rate
of
physical
wear
and
tear
is
much
less
in
the
earlier
years
and
increases
vastly
in
the
later
years.
we're
interested
in
following
the
curve
of
physical
depreciation.
we
would
not
use
straight
line
depreciation
and
a
fortiori,
we
would
not
use
the
double
declining
balance
method
which
accentuates
the
deductions
in
the
early
years
running
directly
contrary
to
the
curve
of
physical
depreciation.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
think
that
would
normally
be
so,
for
most
of
us
who
buy
on
the
retail
market
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
for
a
taxpayer
here
who
gets
the
fleet
discount
when
he
buys
his
new
car
is,
of
course,
that
same
pattern
is
not
demonstrated.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
--
i
had
hoped
that
i
was
demonstrating
its
demonstrable
falsity
in
the
last
few
minutes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
and
i
have
referred
to
the
regulations
which
refer
to
these
economic
factors
to
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
--
i
am
--
i'm
trying
to
refer
the
court
to
the
authoritative,
administrative
pronouncements.
now,
bulletin
“f”
to
which
we
referred
the
court
is
the
bible
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
on
depreciation.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
have
been
advised
that
in
accordance
with
bulletin
“f”,
the
practice
has
been
to
take
into
account
all
of
the
relevant
economic
factors
concerning
the
taxpayer's
business
which
affect
useful
life.
and
i
have
averted
to
these
many
analogous
situations,
bridges,
property
held
under
lease
and
mining
equipment
as
examples
of
cases
where
the
authoritative,
administrative
materials
have
demonstrated
that
you
do
not,
you
do
not
follow
the
abstract
physical
life
where
it
is
clear
from
the
facts
that
the
taxpayer's
period
of
use
of
the
property
will
be
shorter.
i
believe
that
is
so
in
the
mining
case.
i
believe
that
it
so.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard

i

only
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
can
only
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
was
attempting
to
demonstrate
that
the
--
the
practice
has
been
--
mr.

by
practice,
i
mean
my
own
deduction
from
what
the
authoritative
administrative
materials
prescribed,
shall
be
done
in
these
cases.
now,
i
don't
believe
the
taxpayers
resort
to
any
situation
where
there
has
been
any
deviation
and
i'd
like
to
say
again
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i'm
--
i'm
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
as
we
know,
the
car
leasing
business
is
a
business
which
has
been
a
relatively
new
development.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
cannot
refer
to
the
court.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
think
the
testimony
was
that
its
major
growth
occurred
probably
in
the
last
10
years,
since
world
war
ii,
in
any
event.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
would
not
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
perhaps
i
can
answer
it
by
referring
to
specific
cases
which
i've
called
from
the
b.t.a.
reports
and
which
are
available.
the
books
are
full
under
the
heading
of
obsolescence
of
cases
where
taxpayers
and
the
government
argued
over
the
issue
of
whether
the
peculiar
economic
facts
which
affected
the
taxpayers'
business
was
such
as
to
cut
down
the
life.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
like
i'm
unable
to
refer
to
the
court
to
a
--
to
car
rental
businesses.
i
can
refer
the
court
for
example,
to
the
corsicana
gas
and
electric
case,
which
was
a
b.t.a.
decided
in
1927.
there,
a
power
company
had
a
plant
which
had
not
physically
deteriorated
and
had
many
years
of
life
left
in
it.
because
there,
the
local
town
grew
at
a
pace
which
exceeded
the
capacity
of
this
plant,
the
taxpayer
knew
that
it
would
have
to
build
a
new
and
larger
plant.
it
was
permitted
to
deduct
the
cost
of
the
plant
over
the
shorter
period,
not
because
the
property
had
physically
depreciated,
not
because
the
property
in
the
abstract
model
sense
had
reached
the
end
of
its
life,
but
because
the
unique
facts
affecting
the
taxpayer's
business
made
it
perfectly
clear.
he
was
not
going
to
hold
that
property
any
longer.
and
therefore,
the
necessity
arose,
if
he
was
to
recover
his
cost
to
permit
deductions
over
the
shorter
period.
now,
that's
a
case
affecting
a
power
plant.
that
kind
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
believe
these
were
cases
where
there
was
also
no
controversy
over
the
physical
life
of
the
property.
the
--
these
were
all
cases
where
the
question
was
granted
the
physical
life
of
the
property,
are
the
economic
facts
surrounding
the
taxpayer's
business
such
that
we
are
justified
in
cutting
down
the
life
from
that
physical
life
because
of
these
operating
facts.
now,
on
the
power
plant
case,
it
was
because
of
facts
which
were
utterly
unrelated
to
the
physical
rate
of
deterioration
of
the
property
to
the
growth
of
the
local
community
requiring
the
taxpayer
to
use
this
plant
for
a
shorter
period
of
time.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
in
this
--
in
the
hertz's
case?
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i'm
unable
to
answer
that
question.
i
don't
know.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
those
questions.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
would
assume
so.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
precisely,
but
i
would
say
that
even
if
that
were
so,
that
we
--
we
would
not
be
bound
by
what
a
particular
agent
did
in
analyzing
a
particular
return.
the
course
of
an
audit
may
develop
many
problems
in
connection
with
a
particular
taxpayer's
return,
depreciation
and
a
host
of
other
issues.
and
the
--
the
taxpayer
and
the
agent
may
swap
issues,
will
you
give
me
that
issue
and
i'll
--
i'll
take
an
adjustment
on
this
issue.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
mere
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
of
course,
the
--
the
hertz's
corporation
has
a
great
many,
quite
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
believe
they
do.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
can
give
this
statement
which
is
what
we
said
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
in
evans
that
there
are
503
cases
now
pending
before
the
internal
revenue
service
at
various
stages
in
which
this
issue
is
involved.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
believe
so.
now,
that's
503
cases
which
are
now
in
suspense
because
this
--
the
internal
revenue
service
has
raised
this
issue.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
can
refer
the
court
to
the
--
to
the
brief
of
the
american
automotive
leasing
association
which
was
filed
in
a
related
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
which
has
been
made
available
to
counsel
and
to
the
court.
that
association
which
represents
approximately
65%
of
the
long
term
leasing
industry
in
motor
vehicles
in
this
country,
represented
to
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
government's
position
on
useful
life
was
precisely
what
they
had
understood
it
to
be
all
along.
now,
that
brief
is
on
file
with
the
court.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
don't
believe
they
have.
they
have
offered
in
evidence,
testimony
of
accountants
as
to
what
useful
life
means
and
these
accountants
have
indicated
that
economic
life
is
what
useful
life
means
without
indicating
which
economic
factors
are
critical
and
which
are
not.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
--
i
can't
answer
the
--
i'm
not
aware
of
other
cases
where
it
has
been
unrelated
to
cost.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
there
are
no
inflexible
rules.as
a
matter
of
fact,
bulletin
“f”
says
on
its
first
page
as
a
caveat
to
taxpayers.
the
estimated
useful
lives
and
rates
of
depreciation
indicated
in
this
bulletin
are
based
on
averages
and
are
not
prescribed
for
use
in
any
particular
case.
they
are
set
forth
solely
as
a
guide
or
starting
point
from
which
correct
rates
maybe
determined
in
the
light
of
the
experience
of
the
property
under
consideration
and
all
other
pertinent
factors.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i'm
not
aware
of
it
and
i
should
think
a
taxpayer
would
have
to
make
a
very
great
showing
based
upon
their
legislative
history
and
the
language
of
the
act
to
justify
a
situation
where
he
is
entitled
to
deduct
on
his
income
tax
return
as
they
saw
it
here.
from
the
income,
he
realizes
through
use
of
an
asset
more
than
the
cost
of
the
use
of
that
asset
to
him
during
the
year.
as
a
matter
of
fact
here,
the
statute
says
very
specifically
that
it
shall
be
a
reasonable
allowance
for
depreciation
and
we
would
say
that
it
is
not
a
reasonable
allowance
for
depreciation
when
you
depart
from
the
fundamental
principle
of
returning
to
the
taxpayer
his
cost.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
is
correct.
no,
the
depreciation
statutes
make
it
very
clear
that
cost
is
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
deduction,
the
return
of
cost
to
the
taxpayer
in
a
reasonable
way.
