mr.
bernhard,
what
were
you
reading
from
this
time?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bernhard,
i'm
--
i'm
right
in
thinking
am
i
not,
that
it
is
a
practical
matter
in
the
--
in
the
ordinary
case,
it
would
be
to
the
government's
physical
interest
to
have
as
long
a
useful
life
as
possible?
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
--
generally
speaking,
(inaudible)
the
government's
interest
to
have
each
year's
depreciation
deduction
as
small
as
possible.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
reason
these
cases
are
kind
of
offbeat,
is
because
of
this
very
high
salvage
value
and
the
problem
is
further
accentuated
by
the
new
deduction
method
allowed
by
the
1954
code,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
i
understand
that
there's
a
controversy
as
to
what
a
salvage
value
means.
the
actual
resale
that
you
get
under
your
--
under
the
experience
of
your
business,
but
that
--
it's
the
introduction
of
that
very
high
resale
experience
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
creates
--
creates
this
issue,
isn't
that
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
new
problem
in
this
case
that
was
not
present
in
the
evans
case.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
speak,
before
you
go
on.
the
--
in
the
regulations
to
which
you
referred
in
answering
justice
frankfurter's
question,
were
you
referring
to
the
1956
regulations,
mr.
heffron?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
1956
regulations,
of
course,
made
some
changes
in
the
--
and
were
more
specific
at
least,
were
they
not?
you
--
i
--
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
they
simply
clarify
and
reinstated
the
--
the
long
time
consistent
position
of
the
government,
but
at
least,
they
--
they
were
verbally
changed,
were
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
why
--
and
may
not
be
based
on
the
1954
statute
--
1954
code?
justice
potter
stewart
the
regulation
is
based
on
the
1954
code,
made
verbal
changes
do
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
more
specifically
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
that's
why
i
was
trying
to
get
at.
you
were
not
referring
to
those
regulations
in
answering
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
double
declining
balance
method
does
mark,
that
they
reflect
depreciation
in
terms
of
market
value,
so
far
as
automobiles
go,
is
that
it?
isn't
it
true?
i
don't
--
i'm
really
asking
for
information.
i've
always
had
the
idea
that
this
--
from
the
point
of
view
not
of
physical
depreciation,
but
of
market
value
--
the
depreciation
--
that
the
big
depreciation
occurs
in
the
first
year.
second
year
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
speaking
about
(voice

justice

stewart
i
gather
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
its
very
hard
to
find,
to
understand
double
declining
balance,
i
will
have
to
get
it
out
of
your
sleeves.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
that
a
crucial
element
in
the
hertz
case?
