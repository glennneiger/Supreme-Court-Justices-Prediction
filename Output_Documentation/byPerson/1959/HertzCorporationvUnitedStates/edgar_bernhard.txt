mr.
edgar
bernhard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
in
this
hertz
case
are
similar
to
those
in
evans.
this
case
arises
under
the
1954
code
and
involves
the
double
declining
balance
method
of
depreciation,
permitted
under
this
code,
but
before
we
get
into
that
method
and
how
it
operates,
i'd
like
to
pick
up
counsel's
answers
to
questions
put
late
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
know
that
the
counsel
for
the
government,
when
asked
whether
the
elimination
of
capital
gains,
was
the
real
issue
here,
answered
that
it
was
not.
but
he's
apparently
unaware
that
the
government
has,
on
three
different
occasions,
admitted
that
the
elimination
of
capital
gains
was
its
objective.
first
of
those,
that
i
do
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to,
appears
in
the
government's
brief
in
evans.
the
government
stated
at
page
11
of
that
brief,
the
question,
in
this
case,
bears
upon
the
proper
computation
or
determination
of
capital
gain.
in
the
government's
opening
brief
in
the
third
circuit
below,
in
the
--
in
this
hertz
case,
the
government
said
at
page
40
of
that
brief,
“the
simple
fact
is
that
the
profit
is
taxable
at
capital
gains
rates
and
taxpayer,
under
its
view,
receives
the
benefit
of
a
deduction
at
a
52%
rate
and
pays
tax
on
the
profit
resulting
from
the
increased
deduction
at
a
25%
rate."
this
result
can
be
avoided
by
defining
useful
life
for
purposes
of
depreciation
as
meaning,
the
period
during
which
an
asset
is
useful
to
the
taxpayer
together
with
a
reasonable
computation
of
salvage
value.
this
has
been
done
by
section
1.167
(a)-1
(b)
of
the
regulations
referring
to
the
1956
regulations
under
the
1954
code.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
i
was
reading
from
the
third
circuit
brief
by
the
--
filed
by
the
government
below
in
this
case.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
third,
the
government
admits
the
same
point
in
its
brief
in
this
court.
at
page
49,
it
lays
stress
on
the
point
that
the
deductions
are
taken
at
a
52%
rate,
whereas,
the
capital
gain
rate
established
by
the
congress
is
25%.
and
fourth,
the
undersecretary
of
the
treasury,
this
month,
appeared
before
the
house
ways
and
means
committee,
in
behalf
of
new
legislation
in
this
area.
he
was
asking,
he
said,
for
legislation
which
would
“eliminate
the
opportunity
which
now
exists
of
converting
ordinary
gain
into
capital
--
ordinary
income
into
capital
gain”.
he
told
about
the
workings
of
depreciation,
particularly
under
the
double
declining
balance
method
and
the
fact
that,
as
he
said,
under
present
law,
taxpayers
were
entitled
to
take
capital
gains
on
the
sale
of
depreciable
assets.
and
on
that
basis,
he
asked
for
statutory
change
to
eliminate
capital
gains
on
the
sale
of
depreciable
property
at
least,
to
the
amount
of
the
depreciation
taken.
just
prior
to
that
and
the
letter
which
was
--
and
the
--
the
incident
which
was
responsible
for
the
calling
of
those
hearings
at
which
the
undersecretary
appeared
and
said
what
i've
just
accounted,
was
a
letter
dated
february
12,
1960,
which
appears
in
our
brief
in
this
court
at
page
53
in
the
appendix,
appendix
a
--
our
reply
brief,
i'm
sorry,
our
reply
brief
in
this
case.
and
at
the
foot
of
--
of
page
53
of
--
of
the
brief,
towards
the
end
of
the
letter,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
who
has,
in
this
letter,
asked
for
special
legislation
says
“the
proposed
statutory
change
which
would
require
the
gains
from
sale
of
depreciable
personal
property
be
treated
as
ordinary
income
to
the
extent
of
depreciation
previously
claimed,
would
make
it
possible
for
agents
of
the
internal
revenue
service
to
accept
more
readily,
taxpayer
judgments
and
taxpayer
practices
with
respect
to
depreciation
rates
on
salvage
value.”
in
other
words,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
is
really
saying
to
the
congress,
“if
you
will
just
give
us
this
legislation
to
cut
off
capital
gains,
we
can
be
much
more
lenient
about
our
definition
of
useful
life.”
what
he
really
means
is
that
he
would
then
be
willing,
if
capital
gains
can
be
eliminated
by
new
legislation,
to
go
back
to
the
40-year
practice
and
the
40-year
definition
of
useful
life,
not
broken
until
the
1956
regulations
were
issued.
now,
in
view
of
all
that,
counsel's
answer
to
that
question
and
i
want
to
take
up
another
answer
for
just
a
moment,
counsel's
answer
yesterday
is
simply
not
understandable,
in
view
of
these
forthright
statements
from
the
government
that
its
real
purpose
is
to
eliminate
capital
gains
by
redefining
these
basic,
long
standing
concepts
of
useful
life
and
salvage
value.
now,
the
government
also
stated
to
this
court,
yesterday,
that
its
practice
in
the
past,
in
response
to
a
question,
its
practice
in
the
past
was
consistent
with
its
position
here
in
these
cases,
the
evans
and
hertz
cases.
now,
as
opposed
to
all
our
citations
in
our
briefs
to
show
that
this
is
not
the
case,
the
government's
briefs,
first
of
all,
answered
actually
with
only
one
case,
the
ludey
case,
with
one
sentence
from
that
case
which
actually
is
dictum,
because
the
ludey
case,
as
your
honors
are
probably
aware,
does
not
deal
with
useful
life,
how
useful
life
is
to
arrived
at,
the
measure
of
depreciation
and
the
sentence
quoted
which
--
which
the
--
is
the
only
part
of
the
case
that
can
be
quoted
at
all,
that
seems
at
least
to
have
some
connection
here,
is
pure
dictum
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs.
and
yesterday,
in
response
to
a
question,
counsel
for
the
government
when
pressed
to
name
a
--
a
single
case,
as
we
have
been
asking
for
the
government
to
do,
a
single
case
prior
to
the
promulgation
of
the
1956
regulations
under
the
1954
code.
not
in
which,
it
established
the
--
its
new
definition
of
useful
life,
but
in
which
it
contended
for
and
--
in
which
it
contended
for
any
other
definition
except
the
one
we
are
espousing
in
the
evans
and
hertz
cases.
counsel
finally
answered
with
a
single
case,
the
cohn
case,
259
f.2d
371,
but
the
difficulty
is
that
this
is
in
the
same
category
with
evans
and
hertz.
it
was
decided
in
1958.
it's
subsequent
to
the
1956
regulations,
it
does
not
meet
the
--the
real
question
here,
whether
the
government
is
now
changing
position
entirely
or
is
simply
following
up
with
its
past
practice.
now,
i
--
i
wonder
what
the
government
has
to
say
today
about
its
rulings,
its
repeated
interpretations
of
useful
life
in
case
after
case,
and
in
its
own
bulletin
“f”,
which
came
up
yesterday
and
which
i
should
like
to
bring
up
again
in
a
moment.
but
as
to
the
cases,
in
merkle
broom
company
and
i
can
--
i
can
do
each
of
these
in
just
a
second
or
two.
in

1926

board
of
tax
appeals,
the
taxpayers'

period
was
two

government
claimed
a
five-year
useful
life,
the
whole
physical
life
of
the
asset.

of

four
years
and

acquiesced.

mr.
edgar
bernhard
pilot
freight

your
honor.
we
--
we
cited
in
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
it's
at
pages
29
and
62
in
our
brief.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
right,
your
honor.
without
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
--
without
the
new
1954
accelerated
depreciation
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
exactly.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
well,
the
--
the
reason
for
the
salvage
value,
if
your
honor
please,
only
appears
after
the
1954
code
allowing
accelerated
depreciations,
so
more
depreciation
could
be
taken.
and
the
adjusted
basis
therefore,
reduced.
and
then,
if
salvage
value
is
to
be
interpreted
as
the
government
interprets
it,
which
we
don't
for
a
moment
agree
with,
then
you
get
the
difference,
a
wider
difference,
it's
true.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that
also
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that
causes
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
well,
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
wouldn't
say
that.the
--
the
reason
for
this
controversy
is
this,
that
in
1954,
the
--
the
government,
in
granting
our
1954
code
in
granted,
accelerated
depreciation
including
double
declining
balance
method,
restricted
it
to
assets
with
a
three-year
useful
life.
it
didn't
define
useful
life
in
the
statute,
but,
of
course,
you'd
pick
up
the
definition
that
had
been
standing
for
all
these
years.
now,
the
government
now
becomes
interested
in
changing
its
definition
of
useful
life
to
holding
period,
so
as
to
keep
down
as
many
assets
as
possible
into
the
category
of
assets
with
less
than
a
three-year
useful
life,
in
order
that
the
taxpayer,
owner
of
those
assets,
will
not
be
able
to
claim
double
declining
balance.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
it
forsook,
we
say,
its
unbroken
attitude
about
useful
life
and
redefined
useful
life
to
holding
period
in
order
to
get
down
below
the
three-year
limitation
and
it's
interesting,
if
the
court
please,
that
in
cases
where
the
government
cannot
contend
for
less
than
a
three-year
life,
because
under
any
definition
of
useful
life,
it's
three
--
it's
a
three-year
life.
it's
been
held
for
three
years
and
its
total
useful
life
is
three
years,
the
government
again
switches
in
--
in
schaumburg
the
--
the
government
has
switched
back
and
once
it
is
beyond
the
three-year
life
for
an
asset,
it
then
proceeds
to
stretch
it
out
and
go
back
to
its
old
concept
of
full
physical
life.
why?
because
it
can
then,
by
that
method,
again
reduce
the
percentage
--
the
percentage
rate
of
depreciation
to
be
applied
to
those
assets.
if
it
can
stay
under
the
three-year
limit

it's

up

and
was
dealt
with
just
in
passing.
bulletin
“f”,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
court
please,
was
issued
first
in
1920,
it
was
revived
in
1931.
it
was
last
revised
in
1942
and
has
been
distributed
to
taxpayers
in
all
these
years
from
1920
to
at

also.
mr.

it
is

and
i
have

here
and

mr.

it's
apparently
--
it's
not
printed
in

i'm
--
i'm
told,
your
honor.
but
it
--
it
was
offered
in
evidence
in
the
hertz
case.
in
fact,
it
was
offered
in
evidence
by
the
taxpayer
and
then
--
and
another
copy
of
it,
in

by
the

it
was
offered
by
both
to
make
sure
that
we
have
the
current

revision
and

and
we
did.
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
give,
your

portions

please,

beginning
at

here,

and

so
that
it
has
dealt
with
at
some
length,
and
with
some
quotations
from
it.
and
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
well,
it's
beyond
what
i'm
going
to
quote
now,
your
honor,
now
too,
yes.
it
--
so
far
as
automobiles
are
concerned,
first
of
all,
the
bulletin
“f”
provides
--
and
bulletin
“f”
is,
first
of
all,
67
pages
long,
pamphlet
--
67
pages
long
of
which
66
pages
are
lists
of
depreciable
assets,
showing
the
useful
life
of
each
asset.
now,
is
the
government
really
contending
that
those
66
pages
don't
represent
total,
physical,
functional
lives
but
represent
the
length
of
time
that
the
asset
will
be
held
for
the
taxpayer
before
he
sells
it?
if
--
if
bulletin
“f”
represents
holding
periods,
it
could've
been
produced
in
a
--
a
half
of
page
because
the
government
had
simply
have
said
in
its
bulletin
“f”,
“if
you
have
depreciable
assets,
your
holding
period
is
the
useful
life.”
mr.
edgar
bernhard
certainly
be
no
need
to
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
no,
your
honor,
not
inflexible.
but
it
is
described
by
the
government
as
a
guide
to
taxpayers.
there's
a
realization
that
there
maybe
heavy
usage
as
in
taxicabs
which
are
on
the
street
for
16
hours
for
instance
or
more,
or
in
two
shifts
of
--
of
more
than
8
hours
each.
it
is
also,
of
course
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
oh,
for
taxicabs?
mr.
edgar
bernhard
oh,
yes,

that

in

to

offered
testimony.

have
not
proved
that
the
automobile
was
devoted
to
such
extraordinary
uses,
mr.
justice
black,
if
you
please,
that
--
that
the
petitioner
--
petitioners,
the
taxpayers
have
not
proved
that
the
automobile
was
devoted
to
such
extraordinary
uses
as
to
justify
a
higher
rate
of
depreciation
than
that
determined
by
respondent.
that
is
by
the
commissioner,
so
that
what
the
commissioner
is
really
saying
is,
“here
is
you
guide,
if
you,
the
taxpayer,
want
to
bring
yourself
outside
the
guide
for
any
reason,
put
testimony
onto
show
that
you
don't
come
within
it
either
because
of
--
of
less
peruse
or
because
of
extraordinary
uses.”
and
in
our
case
as
i
--
as
i
said,
we
only
got
--
the
only
testimony
was
as
to
the
four-year
life
uncontroverted
and
including
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
no,
your
honor.
except
to
this
extent,
we
accepted
the
government's
bulletin
“f”
as
a
guide.
we
have
testimony
to
the
effect
that,
business
cars,
business
automobiles
have
a
useful
of
four
years
and
there
was
no
testimony
offered
to
bring
it
outside
of
the
guide.
there
was
no
testimony
offered
to
show
that
by
reason
of
usage,
that
that
was
not
before
useful
life
of
automobiles.
and
we
also
testified
to
the
fact
that
we
had
a
reasonable
maintenance
program,
a
repair
program
and
that
our
automobiles
therefore,
had
at
least,
reasonable
if
not
more
than
reasonable
care
and
as
i
say,
that
was
uncontroverted
by
the
government.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
i
--
we
went
a
step
far
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
well,
mr.
justice
black,
if
you
are
saying
amount
of
depreciation,
then
that
it
is
not
the
issue,
but
if
you
are
saying
what
rate
of
depreciation
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
no,
your
honor,
because
in
a
four-year
asset,
if
it
is
held
two
years,
an
asset
with
a
useful
life
of
four
years
should
be
depreciated
at
25%
per
year
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
--
and
depreciate
it
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
at
the
end
of
that
four
years?
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
your
honor.
if
you're
talking
about
this
specific
car,
that's
true,
because
the
--
the
uncontested
principle
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
has
indicated,
the
--
the
principle
is
that
the
whole
useful
life
be
taken
into
consideration
and
in
automobiles,
we
have
already
the
four-year
standard,
permitting
therefore,
a
25%
reduction
by
depreciation
in
the
cost.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
right,
your
honor,
because
that's
in
the
alternative
would
be
to
investigate
every
part
actually.
i
mean
an
impossible
test.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
if
it
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
well,
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
it
could
happen.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
your
honor.
that's
true.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
and
pronouncements
over
all
this
period
and
i
say,
of
course,
that
if
the
government
were
contesting
that
in
any
case,
it
could
put
testimony
on
the
stand.
it
could
offer
testimony
to
show
that
with
this
particular
taxpayer,
his
--
the
useful
life
of
these
automobiles
are
to
be
six
years
or
are
to
be
three
years,
instead
of
four
by
reason
of
his
maintenance
program,
by
reason
of
usage
for
a
shorter
time
per
day
or
by
reason
of
excessive
use.
may
i
(voice

mr.
edgar

it

not.
it
offered
no
such
no
testimony.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i

i
am
very
anxious
to

to
hold
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i

mr.

i

double
declining

mr.

what's
that?
mr.
edgar

i

i'm

they

they

that's

mr.

mr.

thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
your
honor,
the
record
show
in
the
evidence
in
hertz
cases,
that
evans
filed
its
returns
on
the
basis
of
the
physical
life,
a
four-year
basis
for
automobiles,
irrespective
of
holding
periods
since
1936
and
that
hertz
has
been
filing
its
returns
since
1918
on
the
basis
of
four-year
life,
physical
life,
irrespective
of
holding
periods.
in
--
in
evans,
the
year
1955,
it
says
at
record

was
specifically
reviewed
and
approved

no

here
and
so
the

mr.

bernhard
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
your
honor.
and
since
1918
in
hertz.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
since
1918
in
hertz.
these
income
tax
returns
year
after
year
showed
the
four-year
life
for
automobiles
and
if
that
was
not
the
practice
and
the
consistent
practice
over
all
those
years,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
would
surely
have
put
someone
on
the
stand
to
answer,
for
example,
what
the
--
one
of
the
accountants
said
in
the
hertz
case,
record
page
46.
he
said
he
had
under
his
supervision,
an
informal
review
of
the
practice
of
industry
not
solely
that
of
a
rent-a-car
business,
but
general
businesses
in
many
lines.
and
just
as
rough
example,
we
had
accumulated
companies,
whose
gross
sales
were
about
$5
billion
and
in
those
cases,
the
average
life
was
four
years
and
a
preponderant
use
by
these
companies
was
four
years.
i
--
have
you
referred
to
page

i
thought
in
the
evans
case,
did
you
not?

i'm

mr.

i'm
pretty
sure
that
mr.

testified
that
they've
transferred.
mr.
edgar

i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
justice
clark?
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
--
and
the
long
and
continued
interpretation
of
its
regulations
was
to
permit,
in
fact,
to
contend
for
the
four
useful
life
for
depreciation
purposes.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
that's
right.
that
was
the
method
of
computation
which
he
used.
mr.
edgar

oh,
no,

honor.
this
is
a
summary.
this
is
a
summary
made
up

those
three
returns,

three

for
the
three
years

mr.

mr.

mr.

now,
i
--
i'd
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
find
that
record
and
perhaps
i
can
have
someone
search
for
it
because
the
consistent
custom
of
the
rent-a-car
companies
in
these
two
cases
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
i'm
--
i
am
very
sure
that's
true,
your
honor,
because
i
--
i
am
satisfied
that
both
these
companies
followed
this
practice
for
many,
many
years.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
on
the
returns?
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
on
the
returns,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar

i
am
satisfied
that's
true,
although
i
cannot
give,
your
honor,
the
record
page
at
this
time
and
--
mr.
edgar

i
would
like
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
i
would
like
very
much
to
send
the
court
a
memorandum,
if
i
may,
on
--
on
this
(voice

--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edgar
bernhard
sure,
your
honor.
i
--
i'll
do
that
(voice

--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
it's
--
it's
something
over
two
years,
two
years
and
three
months
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
--
so
as
what
the
average
contended
for
by
the
government.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
now,
your
honor,
the
testimony
--
the
clear
testimony
in
hertz
and
in
evans
uncontroverted,
is
that
there
is
no
practice.
there
is
no
rule
and
that
the
--
the
selling
of
automobiles,
the
time
of
selling
the
automobiles
is
dependent
upon
unpredictable
factors.
it
is
no
part
of
wear
and
tear.
it
is
dependent
upon
such
factors
as
strikes
and
lockouts
in
automobile
factories,
in
the
companies
which
delivered
the
cars.
what
our
competitors
do,
war
or
peace,
weather
conditions
even,
new
demands,
new
compact
cars
for
instance,
shall
they
sell
their
cars
and
buy
compact
cars
or
will
that
compact
car
not
be
accepted.
it's
easy
to
hindsight,
to
use
hindsight,
but
most
difficult
to
say
in
1948
what
you
ought
to
do
in
1950.
now,
whether
you
are
going
to
sell
your
cars
in
1950,
1949
or
1952
and
what
the
conditions
will
be
which
will
permit
you
to
sell
and
buy
new
ones
or
whether
they
will
not
be
available.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
what
i
said
was
that
in
the
years
in
review
here,
the
years
in
issue
here,
it
is
true
and
we
would
not
contest
that
we
did
not
hold
the
cars
for
four
years.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
but
actually,
the
--
the
figures
in
the
record
show
a
wide
variation
because
of
these
unpredictables.
may
i
just
say
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
where
we
had
a
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
where
we
had
a
gain?
mr.
edgar
bernhard
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
sir.
may
i
just
say
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
i
--
i
would
like
to
say
in
just
that
one
minute,
if
the
court
please,
that
--
that
i
think
we
have
clearly
shown
and
i
think
the
record
in
both
cases
clearly
shows
that
until
the
treasury's
regulations
of
june
1956,
there
were
no
definitions
of
useful
life
and
salvage
value
in
the
regulations
and
the
consistent
interpretation
of
the
courts
and
the
commissioner
himself
was
our
way.
i
--
i
want
to
add
only
this
much
with
reference
to
massey,
the
--
the
case
which
the
court
will
hear
next.
i
--
i
just
want
to
remind
the
court
again
that
we
do
not
represent
massey.
we
are
--
we
consider
it
the
form
to
in
--
in
certain
respects,
to
our
two
cases,
evans
and
hertz
and
it
is
not
contained
in
the
case.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
i
would
be
happy
to
recite
the
double
the
declining
balance
arrangement
now
and
i'm
awfully
sorry
that
we
did
not
get
to
it.
if
--
if
i
could
have
lived
to
extend
my
time
just
a
couple
of
minutes
for
that
purpose,
i
would
be
glad
--
in
fact
anxious
--
mr.
edgar
bernhard
no,
your
honor.
actually,
i
--
i
do
not
believe
it
is
necessary
to
understand
double
declining
balance
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
--
at
the
answer
to
that
basic
question
here,
which
is,
is
physical
life
the
full
--
is
useful
life,
the
full
physical
life
as
interpreted
consistently
for
40
years
or
is
the
government
now
espousing
an
old
concept
instead
of
a
brand
new
one?
mr.
edgar
bernhard
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
--
in
the
massey
case,
the
--
the
record,
i
believe,
shows
that
massey
was
a
dealer
in
cars,
not
through
of
evans
or
hertz,
that
he,
from
time
to
time,
shifted
cars,
which
he
owned
as
a
dealer,
into
car
renting
or
leasing.
and
then
shifted
them
back
or
sold
them,
let's
say
after
a
six-month
period
or
shortly
thereafter
and
there
is
no
such
indication
in
either
evans
or
hertz,
plus
the
fact
that
he
consistently
sold
the
cars.
i
think
the
court
will
find
consistently
sold
the
cars
for
more
than
his
cost
and
the
--
the
dealer
question
is
very
much
in
the
--
in
the
massey
case
as
it
is
now.
it's
not
at
all
in
the
--
in
the
evans
or
hertz
case.
mr.
edgar
bernhard
thank
you
very
much.
