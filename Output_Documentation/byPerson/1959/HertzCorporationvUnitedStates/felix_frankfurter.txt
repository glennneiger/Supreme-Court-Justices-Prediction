those
are

dealt

in

justice

denying
that
this
which
is
you've
just
gave.
are
they
(voice

--
justice
felix

yes,
or
--
or
other
instances
of
heavy
use

excessive
use

(voice

--
justice

in
fact
--
in
fact,
the
car
doesn't
appreciate
equally
each
of
the
four
years
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you've
taken
average
of
what
the
government
calls
an
abstraction,
namely,
an
automobile
which
is
--
which
is
in
the
hands
of
the
--
have
an
asset
for
four
years
is
averaged
out
to
be
25
years,
but
that
isn't
what
happens,
in
fact,
in
nature
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
could
get
--
get
the
point
of
de
minimis,
but
i
certainly
suppose
there's
more
depreciation
in
the
third
year
than
the
first
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
for
auditing
that
we
do
know
for
other
reasons,
for
simplicity
reasons,
congress
might
do
what
it
did
in
(inaudible)
oil.
maybe
all
wrong,
but
i've
always
assumed
that
i've
read
so
much
--
but
that
does
--
that's
an
abstraction.
sort
of
a
hypothetical,
whatever
it
is.
as
no
--
may
have
no
relation
to
actuality.
so
congress,
for
its
physical
reasons,
or
for
administrative
convenience,
or
for
some
other
reasons,
may
do
this
--
what
you
call
unreal
or
abstract
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
is
abstracting.
you
got
to
argue
it
with
reference
to
treasury
practice,
treasury
regulations,
which
make
you
or
not
to
be
unreal
as
this
appears
to
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you've
just
stated
an
absolute
--
you
yourself
--
and
thus
stated
an
abstraction.
we're
still
going
to
contradict
the
argument,
if
that's
the
basis
on
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
depreciation
has
been
--
by
which
the
depreciation
has
been
governed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
how
did
you
say
it's
unrelated
and
said,
you
take
the
course
and
later
spread
it
on
the
four
years
although
as
a
matter
of
business
practice
you
only
hold
it
for
two
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
not
in
crossed
out
the
adjustments.
the
--
the
question
is
the
--
the
baseline
on
which
you
allow
the
depreciation
when
in
fact
there
never
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--is
a
four-year
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
reference
in
the
regulation
to
that
fact,
mr.
bernhard
stated
from
the
regulation,
variations
as
to
the
kind
of
--
the
kind
of
vehicles,
three
years,
four
years,
five
years?
is
there
any
reference
in
the
regulation
to
the
holding
periods
or
is
that
--
does
that
all
have
to
be
spelled
out
from
your
conception
of
the
relation
of
these
factors
to
cost?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
that
it
brings
on
what
useful
life
means,
whether
useful
life
as
a
thing
or
useful
life
as
an
asset
for
the
particular
holder?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'll
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
return
to
“f”
will
you,
bulleting
“f”?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
need
your
thesis,
but
there
was
answer
to
my
questions.
i
was
referring
to
this
--
the
provisions
in
bulletin
“f”,
which
mr.
bernhard
read,
differentiated
three,
four
and
five.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
put
another
regulation,
what
other
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
which
one
--
which
one's
significant
to
our
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
heffron,
i
do
not
want
to
derail
you,
derail
your
argument
from
the
course
you
want
to
run,
but
i'd
like
to
put
this
view.
for
me,
almost
the
decisive
question
in
these
cases
is
the
claim
that
the
government
is
seeking
to
deviate
from
a
fixed
40
years
practice
to
the
contrary
of
its
present
contention.
will
you
be
good
enough
to
leave
yourself
time
now
to
deal
with
two
questions
that
i'd
like
to
put
to
you?
in
the
first
place,
is
this
argument
taking
out
of
the
air
and
if
isn't,
what
is
the
basis
for
the
argument?
and
secondly,
what
is
its
demonstrable
falsity
or
false
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
doing
it
argumentatively.
you're
doing
it
argumentatively.
what
i
want
to
know
is
the
establishment
of
what
the
treasury
has
actually
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
regulations
of
print.
i
want
to
know
what
the
practice
of
tax
levies
in
this
field
has
been.
is
that
an
unfair
or
an
irrelevant
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
this
has
been
argued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hear
arguments
that
--
that
are
respectively,
if
i
may
say
so,
intellectually
on
both
sides
and
i
can
draw
my
inferences
from
there.
what
i
want
to
know
is
as
you
stand
there,
what
can
you
say
has
been
actually
done
as
to
specific
taxpayers
in
--
in
this
kind
of
a
situation?
not
what
the
bulletin
says
as
you
interpret
it
one
way,
as
he
interprets
it
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
interrupt
you,
if
i
may
interrupt
you.
i
am
very
--
my
knowledge
is
zero
on
--
in
this
field,
but
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
hertz
enterprise
isn't
a
thing
that
began
yesterday?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
been
rather
an
old
concern
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
doing
the
same
kind
of
business.
well,
what
actually
have
been
the
tax
returns
to
which
the
government
either
has
yielded
or
hasn't
yielded?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
find
out
--
find
that
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
the
massey
company,
i
don't
know
about
them.
the
hertz,
everybody
knows.
can't
we
know
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
claim
is
made
quite
emphatically,
isn't
it?
that
you're
--
the
government
is
now
making
a
somersault,
a
legal
somersault.
now,
you
ought
to
be
able
to
refute
that
not
by
having
us
agree
or
disagree
with
you
on
your
construction
of
a
bulletin
or
a
regulation,
but
what
actually
has
been
done
physically
year
after
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
practice,
you
mean,
the
returns
filed
and
accepted,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
issue.
that's
what
i
call
literature.
but
there
must
have
been
returns
over
these
years
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
precisely
similar
situations,
haven't
there
been
or
have
been?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
is
it
--
how
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
can't
find
out,
can
we?
unless
you
tell
me,
my
question
is
irrelevant,
(inaudible)
opaque
or
hasn't
any
sense
to
it.
and
i'll
be
prepared
to
accept
your
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
further
my
dividends
in
this
field.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
don't
tell
me
that,
then
there
ought
to
be
some
way
of
telling
us,
what
has
actually
been
the
tax,
the
--
the
concrete
tax
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
taxpayer
and
the
attitude
towards
such
conduct
by
the
treasurer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
calling
of
businesses,
i
don't
want
to
know
about
bridges
and
i
don't
want
to
know
about
other
things,
because
they
maybe
different,
because
i
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
says
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
many
car
rent
enterprises
are
there
in
the
united
states
roughly,
just
two
or
three
or
200?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
why
does
they
make
returns
on
--
they've
got
--
they've
got
subsidiaries
all
over
the
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
so,
it
isn't
just
an
isolated
instance
and
of
course
you're
not
bound,
the
government
isn't
bound
by
this
or
that
particular
adjustment.
but
if
over
a
course
of
years,
returns
are
made
on
one
day,
which
the
government
hasn't
made
objections,
then
the
government
from
time
to
time,
in
other
cases,
urges
administrative
factors
in
the
sense
of
what
is
done.
and
if
the
difficulty
is
the
reason
why
you
can't
answer
the
question
which
justice
harlan
rephrased,
because
these
are
confidential
returns,
i
suppose
they're
open
to
the
government,
why
aren't
you
in
a
position
to
say
that
it
is
not
true,
let's
say
for
10
years
since
this
business
has
become
current,
it
is
not
true
that
over
the
period
of
a
decade,
returns
have
been
made
on
the
basis
urged
by
the
--
by
--
by
the
taxpayers
here
and
the
government
has
acquiesced
them
in
such
returns,
why
can't
you
make
such
analysis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
reference
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
this
is
--
the
issue
is
raised
anew
in
deviation
from
their
--
what
theretofore,
had
been
accepted
for
a
long
stretch
of
time
or
not,
which
seems
to
me,
to
be
unless
you
tell
me
i
put
the
wrong
the
question.
and
to
me,
it's
important
to
put
the
right
question.
would
you
tell
me
that's
wrong
to
assume
i
can
understand,
but
if
you
say
it
isn't
a
wrong
question,
it's
a
relevant
question
that
the
government
can't
answer,
then
i
have
difficulty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
before
you
get
on
the
way
to
answer
the
question
that
mr.
justice
black
thus,
questioned?
the
question
that
interest
me
so
much,
what
is
the
basis
for
saying
as
you
have
been
saying
that
this
is
a
deviation
of
the
clutch
up
from
the
federal
practice,
(a)
state
what
the
certain
practice
is.
and
(b),
how
can
i
find
out,
i,
an
innocent
lamb
trying
to
find
out
what
is
the
truth
about
this
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
1936,
up
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
since
1936
in
evans?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
1918?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
i
understand
the
government's
argument
--
as
i
understand
the
government's
argument,
it
isn't
of
the
holding
of
less
than
four
years,
but
that
the
practice
of
the
business
was
not
to
hold
it
for
four
years,
namely
that
the
sales
were
usually
made
within
whatever
the
period
is,
two
years
is
it,
mr.
bernhard?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
whatever
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
be
--
must
be
accepted
practice
of
the
business
is
at
the
outset,
not
longer
than
four
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
why
is
there
this
--
why
is
there
this
uniformity
to
which
i
understood
you
to
exceed
a
minute
ago,
if
knowing
the
holdings
are
not
for
four
years,
but
are
for
two
years
or
a
few
months?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
it
isn't
relevant,
then
it
will
help
me
at
least,
not
to
be
told
what
it
is.[laughter]
