mr.
carl
mcgowan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
myself
first
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
court
because
the
court
expressed
interest
in
it.
mr.
schoene
concluded
by
saying
that
he
would
prefer
to
admit
that
he
was
not
clear
on
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
and
whether
there
wasn't.
i
think
i
can
make
that
clear
if
not
to
him
at
least
to
this
court.
the
reference
was
made
to
the
fact
that
the
t
p&w
case,
in
the
tp&w
case,
this
court
left
the
question
of
jurisdiction
unresolved
in
that
situation
which
was
one
of
where
the
injunction
is
found
upon
the
back
of
their
acts
of
violence
committed
by
the
brotherhood.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
new
york
central
case,
when
he
was
still
on
circuit,
dissented
from
a
finding
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
that
case
because
he
felt
that
the
reasoning
in
the
--
in
the
--
judgment
in
dissent
in
the
tp&w
case
was
persuasive.
my
comment
on
that
is
that
i
think
the
tp&w
case
has
turn
analogous
to
the
case
of
the
man
who
stands
along
the
right
of
way
and
shoots
the
gun
on
interstate
train.
and
whether
or
not,
there
is
federal
jurisdiction
in
that
situation,
i
think
it
is
a
real
question.
i
would
respectfully
call
your
attention,
justice
stewart,
to
the
--
to
a
case
decided
earlier
in
sixth
circuit,
the
grand
international
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers,
226
f.2d,
in
which
a
white
employee
sought
an
injunction
against
a
contract
which
the
--
his
union
and
the
railroad
that
was
proposed
--
supposed
to
enter
into.
there
was
no
diversity
there,
there
was
no
diversity
in
our
case
that
the
district
court
in
that
case
dismissed
the
complaint
because
of
lack
of
jurisdiction.
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
noting
that
what
was
really
asserted
there
was
a
right
of
action
accruing
under
the
railway
labor
act
to
be
free
of
the
kind
of
contract
which
the
railroad
and
the
brotherhood
proposed
to
negotiate
and
that
whether
or
not
that
right
could
be
established
at
trial
of
the
case.
there
was
jurisdiction
to
hear
and
decide
on
the
merits
on
that
claim.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
that
sir
is
226
f.2d,
604,
certiorari
denied,
350
u.s.
967
and
i
suggest
to,
if
i
may,
to
justice
stewart
that
his
participation
in
that
opinion
seems
to
me
to
be
more
relevant
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction
here
than
the
doubts
he
expressed
in
new
york
central
case
when
he
was
addressing
himself
to
the
rationale.
it
was
worked
out
by
judgment
in
the
seventh
circuit
followed
by
your
colleagues
in
new
york
central
case.
i
myself
in
the
new
york
central
case
would
not
have
depended,
i
believe,
on
the
sheer
interference
with
the
carriers'
obligation
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
base
jurisdiction.
because
i
think
in
the
new
york
central
case,
what
the
carrier
really
was
claiming
was
a
right
under
the
railway
labor
act
to
be
free
of
a
strike
under
the
circumstances
where
the
union
had
moved
to
take
no
action
under
the
railway
labor
act
by
way
of
a
new
contract,
demand,
or
anything
else
to
lay
illegal
basis
for
a
strike
under
the
railway
labor
act.
i
think
if
the
jurisdictional
question
of
the
trades
in
those
terms,
it
would
resemble
the
(inaudible)
case
more
than
the
tp&w
case.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
well,
i
believe
it
does,
sir.
i
think
i
can
make
that
clear
if
i
state
what
our
precise
contention
is.
and
i
won't
unless
i
denote
this
moratorium
issue
and
the
(inaudible)
issue
because
that's
unrelated
aspect.
it
was
not
central
to
our
main
contention.
we
say
that
if
this
contract
demand
was
proper
under
all
the
circumstances
and
by
that
i
mean
within
the
contemplation
of
congress
under
all
the
circumstances
as
a
proper
demand
upon
the
railroad,
why
of
course
it's
in
the
basis
of
a
legal
strike.
and
there
could
have
been
no
injunction
ground
to
us,
norris-laguardia
act
or
not.
conversely,
we
say
that
if
this
demand
was
not
within
the
congressional
contemplation
of
the
railway
labor
act,
it
cannot
be
made
the
basis
of
illegal
strike
at
the
end
of
the
exhaustion
of
the
railway
labor
act
procedures.
and
therefore,
under
the
railway
labor
act,
construed
in
the
light
of
--
of
all
the
congressional
policies
reflected
to
other
statutes
and
respect
to
transportation,
we
have
a
right
to
be
free
of
that
strike.
now,
that
right
in
my
judgment
arises
on
the
railway
labor
act.
its
existence
turns
upon
whether
you
construe
the
railway
labor
act
the
way
we
say
it
should
be
construed
or
whether
you
do
not
construe
the
way
we
should
do
it.
we
say
it
should
be
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
if
construe
in
other
way,
mr.
justice
black,
we
win,
if
construed
other
way,
we
loose
and
as
i
understand
it,
that
has
been
a
familiar
test
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
these
cases.
now,
i
won't
cite
the
language
of
that
effect
because
i'm
sure
it's
unnecessary.
now,
the
ort
attached
very
premise
upon
which
our
contention
rests,
namely
that
they
say
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
an
improper
demand
under
section
6
of
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
schoene
has
now
repeated
somewhat
from
that
because
he
recognized
that
case
of
one
hypothetical
that
obviously
one
of
the
demands
that
could
not
be
made
the
right
--
the
basis
for
legal
strike.
and
of
course,
they
don't
really
mean
what
they
say,
when
they
say
that
no
demand
can
be
treated
as
improper
under
the
railway
labor
act
because
it
must
be
remembered
the
railway
labor
act
is
of
two-way
street.
the
carriers
can
serve
demands
too
and
they
can
lock
out
the
employees
at
the
end
of
the
exhaustion
of
the
railway
labor
act
procedures
if
their
demand
was
a
proper
one.
suppose
that
we
would
decide
that
we
couldn't
live
with
this
kind
of
obstructionism
with
respect
to
modernization
and
that
we
serve
a
contract
demand
on
the
ort
that
you
cannot
intervene
in
legal
proceedings
for
the
state
commissions,
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
which
we're
seeking
authority
to
modernize
our
operations
without
the
consent
of
the
railroad.
you
think
they
would
bargain
about
that,
of
course,
not.
they
wouldn't
have
to
and
we
couldn't
impound
upon
that
a
legal
lockout
at
the
end
of
the
exhaustion
of
the
procedures
under
the
railway
labor
act.
so
it
is
obvious
that
they
do
not
wish
--
really
wish
to
press
the
contention
all
the
way
that
there
are
no
limitations
upon
the
kind
of
demands
that
can
be
met
under
railway
labor
act.
the
second
more
important
reason
why
that
attack
on
our
premise
is
unsound
is
because
this
court
has
held
in
the
racial
discrimination
cases
that
there
are
demands
which
cannot
be
proper
under
railway
labor
act
and
which
cannot
be
made
the
basis
of
a
legal
strike
on
the
railway
labor
act
and
which
can
be
enjoined
without
reference
to
norris-laguardia.
and
to
the
extent
that
they
have
tried
to
make
it
appear
in
their
brief
that
all
those
cases
deal
with
the
situation
where
the
brotherhood
was
bargaining
for
something
which
was
contrary
to
the
interest
of
a
minority
of
the
group,
that
brotherhood
represented,
i
say,
what
about
howard?
howard
was
the
last
case
in
that
series.
howard
involved
bargaining
for
the
members
of
the
class
which
the
brotherhood
represented
because
there,
the
negro
minority
had
their
own
union.
they
were
represented
by
the
--
the
brotherhood
that
came
forward
in
that
case
with
the
demand
that
a
class
of
jobs
called
porters
be
abolished.
i
presume
that
the
brotherhood
in
that
case
was
stabilizing
their
employment.
they
were
asking
for
all
the
jobs
and
an
another
group
failed
and
it
didn't
affect
their
members
at
all,
so
that
that,
that
particular
rejection
of
that
demand
is
a
proper
demand
under
railway
labor
act,
didn't
turn
at
all
upon
construction
of
the
railway
labor
act
with
respect
to
the
duty
owed
by
the
union
to
the
members
of
the
class
represented.
it
was
rejected
because
--
in
the
words
of
howard
larvey
which
i
think
puts
our
whole
case
very
well.
it
was
because
of
the
repugnance
of
the
union
objectives
in
making
demands
to
a
federal
policy
implied
judicial
construction
of
the
railway
labor
act.
we
say
that
when
you
look
at
the
--
this
demand,
and
the
setting
in
which
it
was
made
with
reference
to
its
purpose
and
effect,
and
what
was
really
aimed
at,
that
there
is
an
obvious
repugnance
between
the
union
objectives
lying
behind
that
demand
and
a
federal
policy
to
be
implied
from
a
judicial
construction
of
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
sir,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
those
findings
for
a
moment.
it
is
true
as
i've
said
in
my
brief
that
i
challenge
only
one
true
finding
of
fact
as
distinct
from
the
conclusions
of
law
which
were
put
under
that
heading.
and
that
was
the
last
sentence
of
the
finding
number
17,
and
i
agree
that
it's
not
a
very
important
point,
but
if
you
will
look
at
some
of
the
last
findings
that
mr.
schoene
read
to
you,
number
18
for
example,
the
contract
change
proposed
by
the
defendant
telegraphers
in
section
6
notice,
december
23,
relates
to
rates
of
payrolls
and
work
conditions
with
the
bargaining
under
national
railway
labor
act,
that's
our
case.
that's
the
conclusion
of
law
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
judge
perry
indeed
said
that
he
didn't
distinguish
too
sharply
between
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and
this
one
is
specific
and
i'm
going
to
object
to
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
carl
mcgowan
except
by
labelling.
that
is
right.
but
in
--
when
i
challenged
this
particular
finding,
he
said,
this
again
could
very
well
be
in
the
conclusions
of
law
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
and
the
other
findings
that
they
in
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
yes
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
well,
mr.
schoene
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
disturb
the
findings
that
like
and
less
that
the
court
of
appeals
virtually
wiped
out
the
findings
in
this
case
and
found
that
the
--
that
the
demand
was
aimed
at
an
objective
which
i
will
describe
in
a
moment
and
that
it
was
not
--
that
section
6
notice
did
not
relate
to
rates
of
payrolls
and
working
conditions
but
again,
if
it
is
treated
as
a
finding
of
fact
they
reversed
it,
i
say
this
is
the
conclusion
of
law.
but
there's
nothing
in
these
findings,
there
are
nothing
in
these
findings
with
which
we
cannot
live
and
still
establish
in
this
court
the
propriety
of
relief
we
got
from
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
sir,
let
me
hasten
to
say
that
i
don't
think
this
court
is
held
very
far
to
our
decision
by
analyzing
this
problem
in
terms
of
management
prerogative.
i
think
i
can
agree
with
my
brother
counsel
in
that
effect.
he
won't
agree
with
me
when
i
also
said
i
don't
think
this
court
is
going
to
be
held
very
far
towards
our
decision
by
analyzing
this
problem
in
terms
of
the
right
to
strike
or
the
literal
provisions
of
religion
to
the
norris-laguardia
act
or
most
importantly,
the
allegedly
limitless
scope
of
collective
bargaining
in
an
unregulated
industry.
that
brings
me
to
the
--
to
the
--
what
the
facts
are
and
then
what
this
command
is
really
all
about
and
what
this
lawsuit
is
really
all
about.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
a
number
--
based
on
the
testimony
whatever
i
know
is
about
the
condition
of
railroad
industry
and
that
is
that
without
modernization,
it
is
in
real
trouble
that
if
the
north
western
railroad
presents
an
aggravated
condition
of
that
i
can
tell
you.
the
testimony
shows
that
when
the
new
management
took
control
on
april
1,
1956,
there
had
been
$8
million
loss
in
the
first
quarter.
the
payrolls
were
in
danger.
our
wage
revenue
ratio
was
the
highest
of
any
railroad
in
the
country
which
is
to
say
that
ratio
of
wages
paid
to
revenues
and
the
north
western
is
slipping
right
down
that
slide
towards
this
court
where
it
was
less
than
20
years
ago.
one
of
the
--
the
new
management
did
a
number
of
things.
they
dieselized
fully,
they
spent
what
few
funds
they
had
on
a
new
car
shop
in
iowa
which
centralized
repair
operations.
one
of
the
things
they
found
that
was
most
in
need
of
action
was
the
fact
that
northwestern
was
built
to
the
grainger
country
and
it
is
a
grain-carrying
railroad
very
heavily,
and
it
was
laid
out
from
the
last
century
where
about
every
five
to
10
miles
where
there's
an
elevator
and
a
lumber
yard,
there
was
a
station
with
a
one-man
agent
there.
with
the
passage
of
time,
the
building
of
hard
roads
right
alongside
of
this
railroad,
business,
now
like
business
language,
trains
disappeared,
and
the
agents
found
themselves
without
anything
to
do.
we
conceives
a
project
of
trying
to
keep
down
the
expense
of
those
branch
lines
and
these
are
the
mostly
rural
branch
lines
by
trying
to
reduce
the
cost
of
the
agent's
expense
and
with
the
hard
road
and
the
telephone,
we
thought
it
was
perfectly
feasible
to
have
one
agent
go
up
the
road
five
miles
and
do
whatever
is
needed
up
there
and
down
the
road
five
miles
and
do
whatever
is
needed
there.
so,
we
devised
the
central
agency
plans.
we
filed
our
petition
under
the
state
statute.
we
filed
in
south
dakota,
november
5,
1957.
hearings
were
held
throughout
the
state.
november
26
to
january
17,
the
telegraphers
appeared
in
those
hearings,
protested,
gave
evidence,
filed
briefs,
participated
in
oral
argument
and
did
everything
they
could.
it's
perfect
to
proper
of
the
litigant
to
try
to
convince
the
commission
that
it
was
not
in
the
company's
interest,
for
the
convenience
necessity
for
that
plan
we
put
in
effect.
they
did
the
same
thing
in
iowa.
they
did
the
same
thing
in
minnesota.
they
did
the
same
thing
in
wisconsin.
in
all
four
of
which
states,
we
received
eventually
orders
from
the
state
commission
ordering
us
or
directing
us,
authorizing
us
to
put
into
effect
with
the
one
exception
of
south
dakota
where
south
dakota
said,
“we
think
this
is
so
important
that
we
direct
you
to
put
it
into
effect
under
the
terms
of
the
quite
separate
statute
giving
us
power
over
the
regulation
of
service
and
the
requirement
of
service
of
a
railroad.
now
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
south
dakota
said
that
it
only
could
but
that's
what
it
did.
we
filed
them
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
we
filed
under
a
separate
section
of
the
statute
which
said
that
whenever
we
--
even
if
it's
close
or
consolidated
a
station
or
remove
the
agent,
we
should
get
permission
of
the
state
authority.
they
said
that
well,
you're
not
really
changing
the
service
here
because
the
agents
here
were
serving
both
places,
the
customers
are
going
to
get
the
service
that
therefore,
we
don't
even
think
this
statute
is
perhaps
adequate,
but
just
to
make
it
clear,
we're
going
to
ship
over
on
another
statute
on
which
we
could
have
gone
out
and
ordered
you
too
rearrange
station
service,
either
of
increasing
it
or
lowering
it
and
therefore
you
are
directed
to
--
to
put
this
order
in
effect
forthwith.
now
in
the
three
other
states,
they
simply
issued
orders
approving
and
authorizing
us
to
put
the
matter
in
effect
(inaudible)
with.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
very
well,
your
honor,
(inaudible).
we
filed
in
south
dakota
november
5.
we
announced
at
that
time
that
this
was
--
we
want
to
reassure
south
dakota
in
order
to
single
him
out
for
discrimination.
so
we
made
a
public
announcement
and
put
it
into
petition
that
we
were
not
doing
this
in
south
dakota.
this
was
going
to
be
a
systemwide
program.
so
that
telegraphers
knew
on
november
5
that
we
were
going
to
initiate
far
reaching
reorganization
of
a
station
agency
program.
it
was
less
than
six
weeks
later
that
we
were
served
with
this
section
6
demand.
now,
i
think
the
chronology
is
--
is
very
significant
and
i
like
to
thank
mr.
schoene
of
being
the
good
lawyer
that
he
is,
but
he
had
also
read
the
new
york
central
case
of
justice
stewart,
where
the
brotherhood
simply
walking
out
in
protest
against
the
closing
of
the
yard,
had
nothing
under
the
railway
labor
act
on
which
to
found
a
--
to
found
a
legal
strike.
he
knew
as
long
as
knew
that
we
were
starting
a
long
hard
battle
with
the
telegraphers
that
a
lot
of
other
people
for
that
matter
over
the
central
agency
plan,
these
hearings
were
going
to
drag
on
for
the
states
for
months
and
months
and
that's
just
the
way
it
work
out.
by
putting
that
demand
and
when
they
did,
and
assuming
the
exhaustion
of
the
railway
labor
act
procedures
withstanding
order
about
the
time
they
got
--
we
got
our
first
order
if
we
got
one,
they
would
have
the
muscle
of
the
strike
weapon
and
that's
exactly
the
way
it
worked
out.
now,
why
do
i
say
that
--
why
do
i
say
that
--
that
this
demand
was
aimed
at
the
central
agency
plan?
i'm
not
just
drawing
inferences
myself,
i
take
it
right
out
of
their
own
words
and
that
is
to
be
found
in
the
--
in
the
record
in
the
strike
ballot.
july
10,
1958
confirmed
all
of
our
suspicions
about
what
this
is
all
about.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
it's
on
page
53
of
the
record
am
i
am
going
to
take
the
liberty
of
reading
it
to
some
degree
because
i
think
this
is
critical.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
sir,
there
certainly
is.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
there
is.
indeed,
when
they
presented
findings
in
the
district
court,
there
was
no
mention
of
the
central
agency
plan
in
those
findings.
you
can
read
the
findings
as
they
repost
are
annoying
of
central
agency
plan
and
the
only
reference
now
is
the
one
we
got
in
because
judge
perry
was
willing
to
add
a
sentence
the
fact
that
we
didn't
try
to
bargain
about
the
central
agency
plan.
but
that
--
this
is
the
circular
in
which
they
insert
the
distributor
strike
ballot
and
ask
for
authority,
they
ask
that
the
worker
--
the
members
to
vote
on
the
strike
ballot.
page
53,
since
mr.
ben
heineman's
described,
security
control
has
gotten
on
north
western
railway
system,
and
we
have
all
witnessed
a
revolution
in
the
management
of
this
railroad.
all
types
of
service
on
which
the
railroad
has
now
a
monopoly
had
been
drastically
curtailed
with
corresponding
inhuman
slashes
in
employment
(inaudible).
the
loss
of
business
resulting
in
the
curtailed
service
in
turn
leads
to
further
reductions
enforced
and
further
reduction
of
services
(inaudible).
well,
last
fall,
a
program
of
this
sort
that
is
a
violent
concern
to
our
members
that
initiated
by
this
management.
this
program
has
directed
the
elimination
of
vast
majority
of
agents
serving
one-man
stations.
proceedings
are
begun
of
where
the
public
service
command
of
south
dakota,
minnesota,
iowa
and
wisconsin
seeking
authority
either
to
close
nearly
all
of
one-man
stations
or
to
have
one
agent
serve
two,
three,
or
four
stations.
similar
proceedings
in
other
states
maybe
expected
momentarily.
in
the
public
interest
as
well
as
the
interest
of
our
members
and
the
organization
as
a
whole,
we
have
done
everything
possible
to
resist
this
program
to
reliance
on
the
provisions
of
our
agreements
and
by
that
he
means
the
existing
agreement
and
they
made
the
claim
that
south
dakota
that
we
couldn't
this
on
existing
agreement.
through
informing
the
residents,
the
effect
in
(inaudible)
is
the
consequences
of
the
railway's
actions
and
to
attendance
that
all
the
hearings
of
the
various
commissions
with
presentation
of
the
evidence
and
argument,
we
have
tried
to
make
reasoned
common
sense,
and
humanity
prevail.
since
last
november,
practically,
all
the
time
as
your
general
chairman
and
four
vice
presidents
as
well
as
much
of
the
time
of
a
number
of
our
local
chairman
and
our
general
counsel,
and
our
president
had
been
devoted
to
these
efforts.
and
now,
listen
to
this,
however,
it
became
evident
that
on
early
date,
that
they
meet
this
on
this
law
effectively
would
require
strengthening
of
our
agreements.
what
does
that
mean?
that
means
we
have
got
to
get
something
new
into
our
agreements
if
we're
going
to
be
able
to
deal
with
this
situation
effectively.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
do,
sir.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
do
because
our
argument
is
that
--
that
in
deciding
what
is
the
scope
and
content
of
rates
of
pay
rules
and
work
conditions
under
railway
labor
act,
we're
entitled
to
have
that
--
that
should
be
construed
in
the
light
of
congressional
policies
and
purposes
with
respect
to
transportation.
and
if
we
can
demonstrate
to
you
as
i
think
we
can
that
there
is
a
federal
interest
in
avoidance
of
waste
and
in
good
efficient
regulation,
both
at
the
state
and
federal
levels
are
both
regulated
in
interstate
commerce
after
all.
but
then
construed
in
the
light
of
that
policy,
and
with
reference
to
its
purposes
and
effect
in
this
particular
setting
of
facts,
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
could
have
intended
or
did
intend
that
we
should
be
put
to
the
test
of
a
legal
strike
in
order
to
try
to
modernize
the
railroad
and
that's
our
case.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
in
the
act
itself,
mr.
justice
douglas,
there
are
no
limitations
on
the
number
of
times
the
mediation
board
could
come
in
and
mediate.
there
is
the
first
mediation
referred
to
as
a
part
of
the
process
and
then
the
usual
practices
whether
there'd
be
a
second
mediation.
would
that
happen
in
this
case,
the
only
controversy
that
in
this
case
is
over
whether
or
not
the
--
the
second
mediation
start
a
new
30-day
period
(inaudible).
the
district
judge
held
that
it
did
and
gave
us
an
injunction
on
the
merits
on
september
18.
that
is
disputed
by
the
other
side
and
i
--
i
--.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
well
neither
the
--
excuse
me
sir,
neither
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
neither
side
has
to
accept
the
emergency
mediation
so
that
each
party
has
in
its
power
after
the
first
mediation
not
to
participate
in
another
emergency
mediation
because
that's
a
proper
service
and
both
sides
have
to
accept.
our
contention
is
that
if
they
both
accepted,
if
they
both
accepted,
and
there
was
another
emergency
mediation.
i
knew
that
the
--
we
think
that
the
act
lies
in
the
congressional
purpose
is
to
try
to
give
and
make
the
mediation
effective
would
call
for
a
new
30-day
period
and
that
was
the
point
on
which
mr.
justice
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
the
terminal
point
is
that
neither
party
has
to
accept
the
proper
services
by
the
mediation
board.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
well,
the
--
the
district
judge
decided
it
since
both
parties
here
accepted
the
emergency
offer
of
mediation,
the
railroad
--
the
union
could
not
strike
until
30
days
after
that
mediation
had
finished.
that
was
--
that
was
the
injunction
we
got
on
the
merits
of
september
19
in
the
district
court.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
suppose
that
the
mediation
board
can
offer
a
--
well
i
presume
there's
a
legal
right
to
strike
or
lockout
as
the
case
maybe.
i
presume
the
mediation
board
could
offer
a
new
emergency
mediation,
but
neither
party
would
have
to
accept
it.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
the
mediation
board
can
certify
the
dispute
to
the
white
house
and
the
president
may
call
an
emergency
board
and
that
consumes
another
60
days
before
that
could
be
a
legal
right
to
strike
approved.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
think
i
can
answer
that
quickly.
i
think
--
i
think
that
this
demand
in
the
first
place,
let
me
say
this
demand
goes
far
beyond
anything
that
they
have
demonstrated
either
in
the
record
or
outside
the
record
in
terms
of
a
complete
veto
power
over
the
discontinuance
of
positions,
not
--
not
limiting
layoffs
where
the
man
is
affected
and
when
he
--
if
he
dies
or
resigns,
his
job
disappears.
this
--
this
demand
is
a
veto
power
over
the
discontinuance
of
positions.
and
that
is
why
we
think
at
all
that
we
are
on
sound
ground
and
we
say
it
also
underlines
the
purpose
here
of
the
brotherhood
was
to
get
control
over
the
modernization
plan
known
as
the
central
agency
plan
because
by
freezing
the
position
as
distinct
from
the
men
in
the
jobs,
they
could
ward
off
this
threat
to
the
number
--
total
number
of
jobs
for
their
members.
and
we
think
that's
the
basic
distinction,
but
when
we
talk
about
stabilization
of
employment.
i
know
of
no
true
stabilization
employment
scheme
which
is
concerned
with
having
men
do
work
that
is
not
there
to
be
done.
their
concern
was
trying
to
balance
the
work
over
the
year
so
that
the
maximum
numbers
of
men
are
allowed
to
participate,
but
if
they
all
assume
work
to
be
done.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
one
of
the
reasons
--
one
of
the
reasons,
sir
that
they
haven't
been
able
to
do
it
in
the
railway
experience,
at
least
in
the
experience
of
one
railroad
has
stated
the
section
then.
they're
the
ones
that
are
always
feel
the
grant
of
the
impact
of
downturn
conditions
because
the
railroad
doesn't
want
to
spend
what
money
it
has
to
keep
the
section
--
to
keep
the
railway
in
good
shape.
no,
because
they
--
they
never
let
go
off
the
job,
they
have
no
permanent
jobs
and
they
get
six
months
a
year
sometimes
if
they're
lucky.
the
reason
is
because
the
dollars
that
could
be
used
to
employ
them
more
are
being
paid.
in
this
case,
we
say
the
station
agents
who
are
not
really
engaged
in
productive
labor
and
for
whom
there
is
not
enough
work
to
be
done.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
conclusion
of
yesterday's
argument,
mr.
justice
black
addressed
an
inquiry
to
me
which
i
would
like
to
respond
at
this
time.
the
inquiry
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice
black,
was
that
assuming
that
there
is
a
showing
in
this
record
of
a
purpose
--
of
a
purpose
and
effect
on
the
part
of
the
demand
made
here
by
the
telegraphers
to
negate
and
frustrate
orders
of
the
state
commissions
approving
and
authorizing
the
central
agency
plan,
what
would
be
the
relevance
of
that
showing?
you
couple
with
that
i
think
another
inquiry
as
to
what
are
the
criteria
to
be
followed
in
judging
whether
or
not
a
particular
contract
demand
is
within
the
contemplation
of
congress
under
the
railway
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
my
answer
to
the
first
inquiry
will
cover
the
ground
of
the
second.
i
recognize
that
this
inquiry
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
this
case
and
i
propose
to
answer
it
with
a
distinct
sense
of
the
feeling
on
my
part
that
if
i
cannot
make
myself
clear
on
this,
i
will
not
have
exposed
that
for
the
informed
consideration
of
this
court
what
we
believe
to
be,
at
least
the
real
issue
in
this
case.
if
the
purpose
and
effect
on
the
demand
are
as
you
are
prepared
assuming
to
be,
for
the
purpose
of
this
inquiry
namely,
directed
a
demand
directed
at
the
central
agency
plan
and
designed
to
frustrate
its
operation
then
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
is
no
difference
in
substance
between
the
demand
phrased
that
is
it
as
it
is
and
the
demand
as
it
would
be
if
the
telegraphers
had
said,
"we
want
a
contract
provision
to
the
effect
that
the
railroad
cannot
comply
with
nor
carry
out
any
order
of
a
state
commission
placing
--
approving
the
central
agency
plan
without
the
prior
consent.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
but
sir
i
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
suggest
to
you
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
that
is
not
the
position
of
(inaudible)
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
mr.
schoene
yesterday
whether
he
considered
that
this
contract
demand,
it
had
become
effective
would
operate
as
against
the
directions
and
authorizations
of
a
state
commission
order
and
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
language
of
the
strike
circular
that
i
read
yesterday
at
some
length
that
they
did
not
make
this
demand
for
the
--
just
to
be
ineffective.
they
were
--
they
said
to
the
membership,
we
have
tried
to
defeat
this
central
agency
plan
on
its
merits
before
the
state
commissions.
we
are
not
getting
anywhere.
therefore
we
have
to
strengthen
our
agreements
and
i
think
you
recall
i
underlined
emphasis
of
that
language,
therefore
we
have
to
strengthen
our
agreements
by
bringing
into
being
something
which
will
do
the
job
of
--
of
opposing,
and
frustrating
and
preventing
the
carrying
out
of
this
central
agency
plan.
it's
also
quoted
in
our
brief
the
language
of
the
--
of
the
strike
call
issued
one
week
after
the
second
commission
had
acted
namely,
iowa
in
which
the
strike
call
says,
i
quote
from
memory,
“but
with
the
need
for
this
rule
has
been
tragically
demonstrated
again.”
what
happened
in
south
dakota
has
now
happened
in
iowa
and
there's
no
assurance
that
it
will
not
happen
in
the
other
states.
now
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
--
but
that
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
sir,
that
brings
me
to
the
--
perhaps
i
should
digress
at
this
point
to
deal
with
what
i
understand
your
suggestion
to
be
now
and
that
is
that
if
we
had
met
and
negotiated
with
the
union,
we
would
have
worked
out
something
presumably
that
would
have
been
less
than
a
complete
veto
power
by
the
union
over
our
compliance
with
the
state
commission
order.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
but
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
may
i
address
myself
to
that.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
mr.
schoene
yesterday
emphasized
that
the
management
had
taken
the
position
that
this
demand
was
not
a
proper
demand
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
that
we
do
not
have
to
recognize
it
as
an
eventual
legal
basis
of
a
strike.
that
is
true.
mr.
heineman
testified
directly
in
the
record
that
he
could
not
recognize
this
demand
for
bargaining
purposes
and
the
reason
for
that
was
that
if
we
had
recognized
it
as
a
proper
demand
under
section
6
by
bargaining
about
it
formally,
when
the
--
when
the
purely
voluntary
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
have
been
exhausted
and
if
the
litigants
were
still
standing
firm
on
this
demand
as
we
had
every
reason
to
think
they
were
going
to
be,
we
could
not
presumably
have
into
a
court
and
sought
to
enjoin
the
resulting
strike
on
the
ground
of
the
impropriety
of
the
demand.
at
least
there
would
have
been
a
serious
question
about
it.
i
certainly
know
what
position
the
laborers
would
have
taken
in
that
case.
they
would
have
said,
"well
you
recognize
the
demand
is
proper,
you
bargain
about
it.
the
purely
non
--
non-compulsory
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
are
now
completed.
we
have
the
right
to
strike
and
you
can't
enjoin
them
because
you
at
the
very
beginning
recognized
the
propriety
of
it."
so
rightly
or
wrongly,
for
legal
reasons
we
felt
that
we
could
not
protect
ourselves
by
any
action
which
recognized
propriety
of
it.
if
we
had
stopped
there
--
if
we
had
stopped
there
and
remained
adamant,
then
i
would
say
that
we
would
be
in
a
very
different
posture
before
the
court
than
what
we
are.
one
of
the
facts
in
the
record
though
at
length
--
we
didn't
stop
there.
the
record
shows
that
mr.
heineman
within
a
few
days
after
the
iowa
order
--
the
south
dakota
order,
the
first
order
came
down,
talked
to
his
director
of
personnel
and
to
me
about
the
question
of
whether
we
should
not
open
negotiations,
discussions
with
the
telegraphers
to
see
whether
they
would
not
be
interested
in
some
of
kind
of
an
arrangement
which
would
take
care
of
the
men
who
might
be
adversely
affected
by
this
order
and
the
later
orders
which
we
hoped
to
get
although
we
had
no
assurance
at
that
time
and
facilitate
their
transition
from
non-productive
employment
to
productive
employment
with
the
least
human
injury.
that
was
the
occasion
on
which
the
decision
was
that
the
next
chance
to
see
mr.
lye
would
be
in
madison,
wisconsin
where
he
would
be
testifying
in
opposition
to
the
wisconsin
plan.
that
was
ten
days
away.
it
was
decided
that
mr.
heineman
would
formally
approach
mr.
lye
on
that
occasion
and
ask
him
whether
he
would
be
interested
in
conferring
about
the
central
agency
plan
either
with
respect
to
south
dakota
or
a
system-wide
basis.
mr.
lye
didn't
say,
"get
back
in
the
channel
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
bring
it
up
to
mediation."
he
said,
"we
are
too
far
apart,
there
is
no
purpose
to
be
served."
mr.
carl
mcgowan
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
can
answer
that
in
this
way.
the
only
finding
which
the
telegraphers
have
ever
relied
upon
as
supplying
that
kind
of
a
finding
is
number
--
is
number
10
really
and
i'm
excluding,
mind
you
those
findings
of
fact
which
i
regard
as
conclusions
of
law.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
under
section
10,
the
court
found
on
the
date
of
july
10,
1958,
the
telegraphers
submitted
to
it's
membership
on
the
property
a
strike
ballot
seeking
the
views
of
the
membership
as
to
whether
a
strike
should
be
authorized
if
necessary
to
secure
a
satisfactory
settlement
of
a
dispute
arising
from
the
proposal
of
the
telegraphers
to
add
to
the
existing
agreements
with
the
plaintiff,
the
rule
proposed
under
section
6
of
the
notice
that
i
referred
to.
i
accepted
that
finding
on
the
ground
that
it
tended
to
characterize
what
the
strike
or
what
the
demand
was
addressed
to.
and
judge
perry
said,
"i'm
not
interested
in
characterizing
in
anything.”
i
said
--
i
said
defining
is
in
conflict
with
the
language
of
the
strike
circular
which
indicated
that
they
had
a
purpose
to
--
to
strike
at
the
central
agency
plan
and
that's
what
this
lawsuit
is
all
about.
he
said,
"i
do
not
characterize
it
at
all
except
as
a
strike
ballot."
they
had
the
word
circular
in
first
and
he
said,
"strike
the
word
circular
and
leave
it
a
strike
ballot
seeking
the
views
of
membership."
and
the
higher
court
in
reviewing
this
matter
has
the
exhibit
in
front
of
it
that
was
the
--
what
i
read
them
yesterday,
that
whatever
attachments
are
there
-
“the
importance”
he
said,
“the
importance
of
this
finding
to
me
is
the
sending
around
of
a
strike
ballot.”
now
i
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
one
of
those
findings
of
fact
was
a
finding
that
the
strike
of
--
that
the
contract
demand
was
aimed
at
the
central
agency
plan
and
that
this
lawsuit
arose
out
of
it.
judge
perry
decided
to
work
from
the
--
from
the
defendant's
findings
of
fact
which
as
i
said
had
no
representative
to
the
central
agency
plan.
you
could
have
read
the
whole
findings
without
knowing
what
the
(inaudible)
of
the
central
agency
plan
and
the
only
reference
to
it
came
in
because
of
my
suggestion
that
he
at
least
ought
to
add
a
finding
that
we
were
willing
to
bargain
about
the
central
agency
plan.
he
said,
"as
to
my
findings,"
now
i
think
--
he
didn't
take
them
up
when
--
and
when
he
said
that
--
i
think
for
the
record,
i
should
probably
deny
it,
but
he
said
these
things.
"i
would
not
have
any
objections
certainly
with
this
--
to
some
of
the
findings
of
fact
in
there.
however,
i
find
that
most
of
those
which
are
not
only
incorporated
in
this
matter
are
irrelevant.”
he
said
later,
"i
understand
that
a
lot
i
have
pointed
out
what
i
think
many
of
them,
most
of
them
that
i
saw”,
and
we
just
have
been
talking
about
these
things
were
fundamentally
true
but
are
not
related
to
the
case."
mr.
carl
mcgowan
the
last
sentence?
mr.
carl
mcgowan
that
plaintiff
did
show
willingness?
mr.
carl
mcgowan
that
was
put
in
at
my
request.
that's
the
one
thing
he
gave
me
on
the
findings.
as
i
said
that's
the
only
reference
in
all
these
findings
which
were
prepared
in
the
first
sentence
by
the
laborers
to
the
central
agency
plan.
now
i
would
suggest
to
mr.
justice
black
to
what
judge
perry
did
was
answer
the
question
which
i
thought
you
would
put
me
by
saying,
"well
even
if
it's
true
that
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
central
--
of
the
strike,
of
the
demand
was
to
--
was
to
frustrate
the
central
agency
plan
and
to
frustrate
the
section
6
notice,
it's
irrelevant.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
disagreed
with
his
--
his
conclusion
on
that.
they
found
that
it
was
highly
irrelevant
that
this
strike,
this
contract
demand
had
been
aimed
at
the
central
agency
plan.
it
was
designed
to
frustrate
an
operation.
therefore
when
we
talk
about
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
to
his
findings,
they
simply
said
his
whole
theory
of
--
of
regarding
those
facts
is
irrelevant
was
wrong.
they
were
highly
relevant.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
nothing
in
the
findings
as
such.
the
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
that
is
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
sir,
at
the
district
court
level,
i
accepted
to
the
--
to
the
findings
made.
i
accepted
to
the
failure
to
make
the
findings
i
proposed
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
i
pointed
out
that
the
--
the
findings
did
not
reflect
the
--
the
true
showing
on
the
record
and
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
an
opinion
in
which
they
said
in
--
in
effect
and
substance
the
--
the
findings
made
by
judge
perry
were
on
a
improper
theory
of
law
and
in
effect
we
--
over
--
we
set
them
aside.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
well
my
first
answer
to
that
if
your
honor
please,
there's
in
the
district
court
in
our
view
has
not
made
any
finding
that
the
central
agency
plan,
that
the
strike
demand
was
not
aimed
at
the
central
agency
plan.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
and
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
simply
that
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
simply
that
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
simply
the
fact
that
they
proposed
this
contract
demand
and
then
a
conclusion
of
law
in
a
--
in
effect
that
this
was
within
the
scope
of
the
section
6,
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
believe
it
is,
sir
because
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
cited
it
could
do.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
it
found
--
it
found
the
record
in
such
shape
that
it
could
--
it
could
say
--
that
it
could
say
this
contract
demand
really
was
directed
at
the
central
agency
plan
and
had
it's
--
as
it's
purpose
and
effect
the
frustration
of
the
central
agency
plan.
and
that
was
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
it
rests
on
testimony
and
on
exhibits
in
the
record.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
well
i
understand.
i
--
i
understand
your
difficulty
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
i
appreciate
your
pointing
out
to
me.
i
think
my
answer
has
to
be
that
i
believe
it
could
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
because
and
i
have
buttressed
that
by
saying
that
judge
perry
in
the
words
i
read
you,
recognized,
recognized
that
there
wasn't
any
real
issue
about
the
truths
of
--
of
these
--
of
these
findings
that
i
propose
with
respect
to
what
the
strike
demand
was
supposed
to
do.
he
simply
said
to
that
they
are
as
far
as
i
saw
them,
they
look
all
true
to
me
but
i
regard
them
as
irrelevant.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i'm
--
no,
sir
that's
a
part
of
the
transcript
that
was
not
printed
in
the
appendix.
the
reason
i
feel
that
i
can
read
that
is
because
the
--
the
(inaudible)
was
printed
in
their
reply
brief,
my
proposed
finding
which
they
had
not
printed
either
in
the
--
in
the
transcript.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
well
i
think
it's
very
true
that
the
--
those
findings
--
the
proposed
findings
should
have
been
in
the
record
and
i
apologize
for
not
being
done.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
am
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
am
reading
let's
say
from
the
trail
of
their
proper
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
regret
it
that
it
is
not
in
the
record,
but
that
was
a
theory
on
which
he
proceeded
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
there
really
isn't
any
issue
here
about
that
the
facts.
the
district
judge
has
simply
regarded
certain
facts
as
irrelevant.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
and
we
say
he
was
wrong
on
that.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
will
very
see
if
that
document
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
this
was
--
this
was
not
in
the
transcript.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
think
these
--
these
matters
were
discussed
if
your
honor
please
and
that's
my
only
--
the
only
answer
i
can
give
to
that.
it
was
not
in
the
transcript
as
such.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
if
–
if
the
--
if
the
decision
is
that
this
is
a
proper
demand
under
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
it
--
i
would
say
--
if
--
if
it
is
a
matter
of
law,
it
is
held
--
held
by
this
court
to
be
within
the
contemplation
of
congress
and
those
words
and
maybe
they
were
--
why
of
course
they
the
--
they
have
the
right
to
strike.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
yes,
sir
but
that's
the
critical
issue
in
my
opinion.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
this
demand
was
served
in
december
of
1957,
six
weeks
after
we
had
filed
our
petition
in
south
dakota
and
south
dakota
order
came
down
in
may.
so
that
it
was
a
south
dakota
order
as
such
came
in
after
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
we
might
as
well
abandon
the
whole
project.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
sir
it
is
the
issue
and
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
if
i
may
go
back
to
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
the
criteria
if
your
--
if
you
honor
please
are
what
congress
intended
to
be
the
scope
of
the
--
of
collective
bargaining
under
that
section
or
statute.
and
that
was
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
in
answer
to
what
i
thought
was
your
inquiry
yesterday
and
it's
--
and
i
would
like
to
deal
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
sir,
so
far
as
i
know
and
nothing
in
the
record
supports
it
now
in
the
--
out
of
the
record,
material
contained
in
our
appendix,
there
is
no
contract
in
being
which
imposes
a
veto
power
over
the
discontinuance
of
positions
as
distinct
from
severance
pay
plans,
limitation
of
layoffs
which
effect
the
individual
in
the
job
when
he
dies,
resigns
or
get
promoted,
the
position
does
not
have
to
be
continued.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
this
is
a
unique
demand.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
let
me
illustrate
it
if
i
may
by
the
--
by
the
passenger
train
analogy.
at
the
present
time
if
we
run
a
passenger
train,
we
have
to
have
a
fireman
on
the
diesel.
we
don't
think
he's
--
that
on
a
passenger
train,
a
train,
a
freight
train
or
a
switching.
but
if
business
dries
up
so
that
we
don't
have
to
run
that
freight
train,
we
don't
have
to
maintain
the
position.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
my
answer
to
that
is
the
one
i
gave
at
the
beginning.
if
we
had
negotiated
with
them
about
it,
we
would
have
recognized
the
propriety
of
the
demand.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
do
not
think
so,
sir
and
i
will
cite
for
that
reason
the
--
the
howard
case.
now
in
the
howard
case,
the
demand
served
upon
the
railroad
was
you
discontinue
the
class
of
the
positions
that
bears
the
name
of
porters.
now
the
railroad
there
under
strike
pressure
and
not
willing
to
take
its
chances
in
trying
to
get
an
injunction
later
caved
in
and
signed
up.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
it
was
a
racial
question
but
established
the
first
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
and
we
--
it
was
--
it
was
not
an
illegal
demand
if
your
honor
please?
it
was
held
to
be
without
the
contemplation
of
congress
under
the
statutory
scope
of
bargaining
on
the
railway
labor
act.
there
was
no
constitutional
problem.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
the
basis
of
the
holding
was
that
under
the
railway
labor
act,
a
demand
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
and
--and
a
contract
of
this
kind
and
presumably
the
demand
which
gave
rise
to
the
contract
was
not
a
proper
subject
of
bargaining.
and
let
me
ask
if
i
may
this
question,
suppose
the
railroad,
instead
of
caving
in
and
agreeing
to
that
demand
in
the
howard
case
and
said,
"we
think
this
an
improper
subject
of
bargaining
and
we
will
not
negotiate
with
you
about
it."
do
you
think
they
would
have
been
obliged
to?
mr.
carl
mcgowan
there
are
different
kinds
of
discrimination
if
your
honor
please
and
--
and
racial
is
only
one
of
them.
as
i
tried
to
say
yesterday,
we
think
that
a
veto
power
or
the
discontinuance
of
any
position
has
its
own
discriminations.
it
discriminates
against
the
employees
who
would
be
paid
more
money
if
there
were
dollars
to
pay
them.
it
discriminates
against
the
section
hand
who
was
laid
off
because
of
these
fellows
who
were
going
to
keep
on
working
eight
hours
a
day
even
though
they
only
have
15
minutes
work
to
do
as
the
state
commission
found.
it
discriminates
against
the
--
a
management
who's
trying
to
modernize
and
to
comply
with
the
congressional
policy
of
bringing
the
railroad
into
the
20th
century.
it
discriminates
against
the
investors,
in
case
of
the
north
western
railroad
that
hasn't
been
returned
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
--
to
the
stockholder.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
it's
the
policy
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
it's
the
policy
of
congress
that
we're
trying
to
find
and
we
--
we
--
if
the
court
say
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
if
we
had
negotiated,
we
would
have
recognized
the
propriety
of
the
demand
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
if
the
--
if
the
union
had
stood
on
it
and
there
is
no
power
in
this
land
it
could've
made
them
depart
from
it,
if
they
didn't
want
to
under
railway
labor
act,
we
would
have
been
faced
with
a
strike
and
i
say
that
if
we
had
recognized
it,
we
would
not
have
been
able
to
go
into
a
district
court
and
contend
that
we
were
entitled
to
injunction
because
the
demand
has
been
improper.
that
was
why
our
hands
were
tied
with
respect
to
negotiating
and
fought
with
it
--
about
it
formally.
what
we
did
do
and
i
haven't
even
had
a
chance
to
--
completed
the
history
of
this
negotiation,
i'm
sorry
--
was
that
we
went
outside.
we
went
--
the
--
the
formal
demand
and
tried
to
find
out.
we
tried
to
negotiate
with
them
on
some
basis
other
than
one
which
would
recognize
the
propriety
of
the
demand.
we
found
out
in
that
process
that
they
weren't
interested
in
anything
except
that
demand
that
they
were
going
to
stand
on.
why?
because
it
gave
them
the
veto
power
over
the
positions
and
kept
the
jobs
in
being,
despite
the
central
agency
plan
authorizations.
every
--
every
suspicion
we
had
about
this
was
confirmed
by
efforts
to
negotiate
with
them.
we
offered
them
--
yesterday,
mr.
schoene
talked
about
supplemental
employment
benefits,
i
mean
about
--
about
how
we
have
reduced
employment
at
the
volume
we
did.
in
the
summer
of
1956
when
a
--
when
the
new
management
took
over
and
it
was
plain
that
we
had
to
do
a
lot
of
things
at
north
western
to
keep
it
alive,
our
management
sought
out
mr.
george
harrison
and
we
negotiated
with
him
the
first
supplemental
employment
benefits
agreement
in
way
of
history
and
we
were
criticized
for
it
by
the
other
railroads.
we
offered
that
--
that
--
s.u.b.
agreement
that
was
entered
into
by
every
non-operating
union
except
the
telegraphers.
this
record
shows
it
was
offered
to
the
telegraphers.
in
1957,
barely
the
time
it
was
entered
into
also
and
mr.
--
mr.
lye
testified
on
the
stand
that
he
assumed
as
he
knew
was
the
case
that
this
s.u.b
agreement
was
available
to
him
in
respect
to
his
employees
on
a
date,
on
a
basis
retroactive
to
december
3,
1957.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
as
i
understand
your
question
your
honor
it
is,
what
was
there
in
the
record
which
would
enable
the
court
of
--
mr.
carl
mcgowan
i
--
i
believe
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
that
is
right.
mr.
carl
mcgowan
they
concluded
on
the
basis
of
what
was
in
the
record
and
we
submit
that
there
was
ample
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that
conclusion.
