justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
was
just
one
proposal
as
i
understand,
am
i
right
mr.
schoene?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
proposed
the
insertion
of
the
covenant
that
no
position
in
existence
on
december
3,
1957,
it
would
be
abolished
or
discontinued
except
by
agreement
between
the
carrier
and
the
organization.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
tell
me
right
exact
place
mr.
schoene
how
did
he
ordered
the
action
to
dismiss
and
at
the
same
time
ordered
an
injunction
to
issue?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
must
admit
this
new
order
because
i
never
have
seen
a
notice
like
this?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
that
then
just
a
part
of
the
--
of
the
bargaining
agreement
between
departments?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
raises
the
old
question
that
i
had
a
while
ago.
i
don't
understand
how
the
court
is
without
jurisdiction,
it
can
be
subject
to
some
exemption
for
truth
and
then
maybe
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
here,
don't
waste
time
about
it
but
i
just
want
to
withstand
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
i
didn't
understand
mr.
justice
harlan
to
ask
you
to
moot
but
that
whether
they
were
merged
in
the
merits
--
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
mcgowan
may
i
ask
you
sir,
as
i
understand,
your
jurisdiction
here
was
based
upon
1331
and
1337.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
the
right
then
to
fall
within
those
sections
must
be
one
“arising
under”
not
involving
the
constitution
or
laws,
is
that
not
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then
here,
does
your
action
do
more
than
involve
the
constitution
or
laws?
does
it
arise
under
the
constitution
or
laws
of
united
states?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
whole
--
it
couldn't
be
made
--
if
the
whole
couldn't
be
made
or
only
that
it
was
on
exclusive
management
prerogative
over
which
(inaudible)
bargained.
now,
which
is
(inaudible)?
