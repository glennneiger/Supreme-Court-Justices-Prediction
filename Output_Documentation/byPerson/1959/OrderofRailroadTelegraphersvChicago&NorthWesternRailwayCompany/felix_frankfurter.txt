justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
--
would
you
mind
stating
what
you
deem
the
basic
jurisdictional
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
do
that
i
take
it
because
you
think
that
will
make
clearer
the
jurisdictional
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
put
my
question
because
usually,
i
like
to
refresh
my
mind
first
it
was
so
clear
that
there's
no
jurisdiction.
is
that
a
good
reason
for
not
starting
with
that.
that's
why
i
assumed
that
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
i
ask
you
this
just
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
such
a
–
isn't
such
an
agreement
depended
upon
what
state
commission
is
doing
abolishing
stations
and
so
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
this
must
be
a
bargainable
question
under
the
railway
labor
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
thinking
of
the
early
case
of
new
heavens
where
we
held
that
certainly
the
public
service
commission
except
that
it
is
called
i
have
forgotten
what,
can
abolish
(inaudible)
the
railway
labor
act
that's
involved
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
just
put
in
a
minute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
injunction
in
of
december
19th
because
of
his
assumption
that
30
days
more
could
be
(inaudible)
have
a
substantial
order
of
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
contested
before
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
it's
merely
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
discretionary
power
to
issue
it
but
as
to
the
power
to
issue
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
fraction
of
30-day
extension?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that
there
is
no
second
30-day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that
mr.
schoene.
they
had
no
claims
on
the
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
clear
up
another
thing,
first
is
the
outstanding
agreement
which
they
sought
to
--
of
which
they
gave
the
notice
--
to
which
you
gave
the
notice
that
you
wanted
an
amendment.
a
minute
ago,
few
minutes
ago
you
spoke
of
the
mediation
agreement
of
1956,
what
was
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
including
chicago
north
western?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
continue
automatically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
schoene,
would
you
take
care
of
curiosity
of
mine
if
you
stay
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
referring
to
finding
that
it
becomes
now
that
discussing
the
significance
whether
there
is
a
controversy
as
to
whether
the
findings
are
challenged
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
are
challenged
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
that
(voice
overlap)
substantially
identical
to
the
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
was
that
challenged
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
they
have
relevance
to
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
anything
that
may
forgetting
the
law,
anything
that
seems
rationally
related
to
the
industrial
relations,
to
the
employer
and
employees
on
railroad
is
the
fit
subject
to
be
tendered
by
the
union?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
required
to
be
responded
through
the
railway
labor
act,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
follows
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
schoene,
in
the
interest
of
time,
i
wonder
if
you
can
help
all
of
us,
if
you
state
it
again
without
arguing,
leaving
your
time,
what
the
materials
are
on
which
the
first
issue
that
you've
stated
to
be
resolved
by
this
court?
and
what
am
i
look
in
decisions
of
this
court
in
practice
before
those
various
branches
under
the
railway
labor
act,
et
cetera,
et
cetera?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
reading
it
to
me
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
argue
it
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
may
i
ask
whether
in
the
breathe
of
your
statement,
would
i
be
entitled
to
infer
if
the
trainmen
today,
1960
think
that
their
interest
requires
protection
from
membership
on
the
board
of
directors,
you
would
regard
that
as
something
that
you
have
the
right
to
present?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
it
isn't
as
broad
as
i
have
phrased
it
namely,
anything
which
to
thinking
person
not
versed
in
law
would
be
a
relevant
consideration
to
industrial
relation
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
judicial
knowledge
but
judicial
notice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mcgowan,
how
much
would
one
have
to
travel
outside
the
findings
of
the
district
court
to
validate
your
last
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
by
labelling
them
as
such.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
by
labelling
them
as
such.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
the
dates
of
these
state
orders
are
relevant
to
the
dates
of
this
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
is
no
--
if
mediate
--
if
emergency
intervention
by
the
mediation
board
is
not
accepted
just
as
the
right
to
strike,
is
there
any
--
any
more
left
under
the
railway
labor
act
to
accommodate,
i
am
using
it
purposely
useful
word
or
non
technical
word
short
to
accommodate
the
claim
on
one
side
of
this,
on
the
other
short
of
economic
tussle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mcgowan,
if
the
recital
that
you
just
made
is,
i
am
inviting
the
colloquy
of
this
case,
leads
me
to
ask
this
question.
is
there
anything
in
the
findings
of
fact
that
the
district
court
dealing
with
the
relation
of
the
demand
of
the
telegraphers
to
the
central
agency
plan,
in
the
findings
of
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
grateful
even
turning
counsel,
my
difficulties
with
this
--
with
this
case
and
i
say
that
my
difficulty
with
your
case
is
addressed
just
here
as
to
findings
and
what
was
relevant
--
to
what
was
relevant
in
the
way
we
--
we
have
faced
the
record
that
turns
here.
as
i
understand
your
case
is
the
way
you
put
just
two
minutes
ago
or
minute-and-half
ago
namely,
that
their
demand,
that's
set
forth
in
section
3,
no
position
that
existed
or
did
not
say
an
attack
on
and
an
objection
to
the
central
agency
plan
for
which
you
have
the
authority
to
say
if
you
have
forced
the
commission,
that
is
correct,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
the
findings
as
i
read
them
or
as
you
expound
them
in
which
that
issue
is
dealt
with,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
talking
about
the
findings
--
there's
nothing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
findings
as
such.
therefore
the
case
goes
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
of
the
findings
and
no
so
far
as
i've
been
informed,
no
conduct
of
--
no
counter
submission
of
findings
by
you,
the
denial
of
which
was
accepted
through
you
by
so
that
you
then
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
saying
that
the
findings
do
not
reflect
the
evidence,
the
findings
do
not
reflect
the
issues
that
were
contested
and
therefore
that
was
error
and
there
should
be
either
a
reversal
of
the
decree
with
a
remission
to
the
district
court
to
deal
with
that
matter
or
as
i
gather
from
what
you
indicated,
though
not
said,
that
isn't
necessary
because
on
the
face
of
things
the
findings
have
no
relation
to
the
record.
and
therefore
i
–
my
difficulty
is
that
the
issue
you
present
is
really
not
contained
within
the
finding,
the
jury
might
ask
to
disregard
the
findings
in
a
--
in
an
appropriate
way
of
objection
to
the
findings
having
been
made
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now
today
--
and
i
--
i
want
to
be
informed
if
this
--
is
this
--
if
this
were
--
the
old
equity
rules
apply
and
an
appeal
in
equity
permits
the
appellate
court
to
ascertain
the
facts
on
its
own
basis,
on
its
own
authority,
i
would
have
no
trouble
about
this.
the
court
of
appeals
sit
before
the
--
that
the
old
rule,
before
the
new
rule,
the
court
of
appeals
could
as
a
de
novo
proceedings
assess
on
the
record
that
the
findings
were
not
justified
and
did
not
relate
to
the
record.
is
that
still,
is
that
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
and
now
we
are
allowed
not
merely
to
say
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
not
making
findings
to
which
you
say
accepted,
you
do
not
make
it
but
that
we
make
the
finding
rather
than
have
(inaudible)
make
it
on
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
quite
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
made
findings
as
to
what
the
telegraphers
proposed
and
on
that
basis,
it
made
it's
ruling
(inaudible)
you
that's
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that's
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
--
are
you
going
to
answer
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
make
findings
on
the
basis
of
the
record
in
lieu
of
or
because
of
this,
the
court
didn't
make
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
more
simply
the
word
that
you
say
that
this
was
really
directed
against
your
being
allowed
to
carry
out
the
decrees
or
the
orders,
whatever
you
call
them
as
the
four-state
commission
is
the
word
for
them.
suppose
i
agree
with
you,
is
the
record
in
such
shape
that
i
can
make
that
finding
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
the
court
of
appeals.
my
question
is
but
could
it
do
it?
in
other
words
it
made
it
properly
such
a
--
such
a
conclusion,
partly
rests
on
the
documents,
doesn't
it,
namely,
that
the
--
the
proceedings
before
the
south
dakota
and
the
other
commission
partly
rest
on
proceeding
that
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of.
it
partly
also
rests
on
human
testimony
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
sure
and
therefore
my
question
is
and
on
--
and
really
the
question
in
my
mind
--
that's
my
difficulty,
whether
that
can
be
done
by
an
appellate
court
rather
than
sending
it
back
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
make
findings
relevant
to
that
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
it's
so
clear
that
there
isn't
anything
left
for
a
(inaudible)
court
to
deal
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
couldn't
help
but
see
that
you
read
some
--
it's
not
a
printed
record
but
from
a
document,
now
is
that
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
also
a
great
believer
in
having
all
relevant
documents
before
the
court
if
it's
to
decide
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
was
meant
to
be
a
criticism
that
anybody,
just
sought
to
elicit
whether
some
way
if
this
really
so,
if
the
judge,
the
district
judge
ruled
that
this
issue
is
irrelevant
under
--
then
let's
have
testimony
on
that
whether
it's
relevant
or
not,
i
should
think
that
that
court
decides
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
this
could
be
probably
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
no
doubt
that
you're
reading
from
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
for
--
just
for
my
own
self
would
be
glad
that
arrangements
could
be
made
whereby
--
either
by
agreement
of
counsel
or
by
leave
of
court
that
could
come
before
us.
it
is
one
thing
to
have
a
district
court
say
something
isn't
relevant
when
on
the
face
of
things
to
me
at
least
it
is
relevant,
that's
certainly
pertinent
to
the
issues
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
i
just
want
to
ask
you
one
short
question.
the
court
of
appeals
that
granted
to
--
that
this
is
my
--
what
might
be
called
procedural
problems
of
which
i
think
better
the
--
from
the
people
concerned
and
i'm
jew.
the
employee
--
the
court
of
appeals
acted
with
reference
to
the
orders
of
the
south
dakota
and
the
iowa
commission
and
if
they
were
going
to
interpret
it
the
demand
of
the
telegraphers
in
relation
to
the
authority
of
those
two
states,
but
i'm
not
ignoring
them.
what
basis,
what
was
the
argument,
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
material
on
the
basis
of
which
the
court
of
appeals
rested
its
decision
in
interpreting
the
demands
of
the
telegraphers
in
light
of
what
the
state
commission,
what
to
do
and
did
in
fact
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
just
on
the
record
without
any
knowledge
of
judge
perry's
remarks
or
judgment
that
all
that
was
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
on
the
basis
of
what
is
contained
between
the
covers
of
this
paper
volume.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
concluded
that
you
cannot
take
the
demand
of
the
telegraphers
in
isolation
but
you
must
tie
them
to
this
central
agency
program,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
the
printed
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
we're
going
have
part
of
what's
not
in
the
printed
record,
we
ought
to
have
everything
that's
relevant
to
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
have
no
objection
to
considering
what
the
colloquy
between
judge
perry
and
yourself
and
mr.
mcgowan,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you
one
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
sir?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
telegraphers
asked
was
not
something
that
was
already
in
the
collective
agreement,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
were
asked
for
something
new?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
interstate
commerce
act
has
a
very
specific
provision
on
which
a
lot
of
subsidiary
provisions
are
based,
requiring
railroads
to
be
conducted
in
the
most
efficient
and
economic
method.
i'm
not
now
in
engaged
in
dealing
with
what
is
negotiable
or
not,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
railway
labor
act
that
would
prevent
a
railroad
in
going
to
the
commission
or
the
commission
on
its
own
motion
the
cutting
down
jobs,
(inaudible)
if
--
if
they
found
that
the
commission
--
as
the
icc
found
that
the
most
economic
and
efficient
conduct
of
the
railroad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
could
it
not
say
you've
got
a
lot
of
redundant
jobs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
suppose
if
both--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
absence
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
here
and
was
told
here
is
you
can't
cut
down
what
the
railway
labor
act
demanded,
but
in
the
absence
of
something,
that
it
is
within
collective
agreement,
could
not
the
interstate
commerce
commission
tomorrow
say
in
carrying
out
that
major
policy
on
which
so
much
of
the
rest
of
the
act
of
the
interstate
commerce
transportation
also
saying,
"you
have
a
lot
of
redundant
jobs
and
except
the
vice
president's
job"
or
even
exceptive
general
counsel
if
i
may
say
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sure
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
dealing
here
are
we
not
--
i
don't
know
what
its
relevance
is
but
we're
dealing
here
not
with
a
provision
in
a
collective
agreement
but
a
proposal
to
put
something
into
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
schoene
the
argument
or
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
controversy
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
essentially
on
the
--
on
sustaining
or
rejecting
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
on
the
basis
of
which
(inaudible),
is
that
