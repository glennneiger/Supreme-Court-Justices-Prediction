mr.
lester
p.
schoene
if
the
court
please,
this
case
is
here
as
a
result
of
this
court's
order
of
october
the
12th,
1959,
granting
a
petition
for
a
writ
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
that
judgment
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
which
had
denied
a
permanent
injunction
against
a
strike
and
have
dismissed
the
complaint.
the
attempted
strike
arose
out
of
a
union's
proposal
under
the
railway
labor
act
to
amend
the
existing
agreements
to
include
a
rule,
providing
that
no
position
in
existence
on
december
3rd,
1957,
will
be
abolished
or
discontinued
except
by
agreement
between
the
carrier
and
the
organization.
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
goes
into
considerable
discussion
of
the
facts
which
we
believe
to
be
largely
irrelevant
and
i
think
its
holding
can
be
readily
summarized
by
a
few
quotations,
beginning
on
page
382
of
the
record
where
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
appears,
it
actually
begins
a
few
pages
earlier
than
that
on
page
377
of
the
record.
with
respect
to
the
proposal
that
i
have
quoted,
the
court
of
appeals
said
on
page
382,
“certainly,
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
divest
a
carrier
of
the
right
to
manage
and
control
the
administrative
functions
of
its
business
enterprise
and
conduct
its
business
operations
without
exercise
of
a
veto
power
by
the
union.”
here,
the
union
is
demanding
such
veto
power
over
the
abolition
of
any
position
in
existence
on
december
3rd,
1957.
the
union
is
attempting
to
obtain
through
the
collective
bargaining
processes
through
railway
labor
act
that
which
would
prohibit
north
western
from
complying
with
the
orders
of
the
south
dakota
public
utilities
commission
and
the
iowa
state
commerce
commission.
in
short,
this
is
an
attempt
by
the
union
to
erogate
to
itself
the
prerogatives
that
have
been
traditionally
and
rightfully
managements
while
at
the
same
time
assuming
none
of
the
corresponding
burdens
and
responsibilities.
then
turning
to
page
384,
near
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
court
in
further
substantiation
of
that
holding
sirs,
we
see
no
material
difference
between
the
howard
case
and
the
case
before
us,
the
reference
to
the
howard
case
is
of
course
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
against
howard
at
343
u.s.
768.
and
then
on
page
385
of
the
record,
the
court
says,
“we
therefore
hold
that
such
a
demand
thus
here
made
by
the
union
is
completely
outside
the
ambit
of
rates
of
pay
rules
and
working
conditions
as
those
words
are
used
in
the
railway
labor
act
and
cites
the
north
shore
case
and
hence,
is
not
within
the
scope
of
mandatory
bargaining.
therefore,
the
terms
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
are
here
inapplicable.
in
further
support,
the
court
relied
on
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
the
borg-warner
case.
now
the
–
with
this
holding,
the
court
disposed
off
a
number
of
issues
that
were
not
specifically
considered.
as
you
will
note
from
reference
to
the
petitioner's
brief,
pages
14
to
15,
there
are
a
considerable
variety
of
issues
embraced
in
this
case,
all
of
which
are
disposed
out
by
the
court's
determination
that
a
permanent
injunction
against
the
strike
should
have
been
issued
by
the
district
court.
now,
in
the
course
of
the
development
of
this
case,
there
have
been
so
many
instances
in
which
by
taking
facts
out
of
context.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no
we
did
not,
but
the
basic
jurisdictional
question
is
raised
here
for
the
first
time.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes,
i
would
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
the
question
of
jurisdiction
might
arise
at
any
time.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes,
the
--
the
jurisdiction
on
the
court
would've
--
of
the
district
court
was
invoked
on
the
theory
that
rights
were
being
claimed
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
at
the
time
that
the
complaint
was
filed,
at
least
the
part
of
the
complaint
seemed
to
have
similarities
to
chicago
river
--
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
against
the
chicago
river
railroad
and
it
seemed
at
point
to
present
his
sufficient
claim
of
federal
right.
there
was
never
any
jurisdictional
claim
on
any
other
head
of
jurisdiction,
but
as
the
case
has
proceeded
the
nature
of
the
federal
right
claim
has
seemed
to
us
to
become
more
and
more
vague
until
we
felt
compelled
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
this
court
that
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
there
appears
to
be
a
basic
lack
of
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
--
i'm
going
to
tackle
that
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
a
--
the
federal
right
is
not
sufficient
to
support
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
diversity
was
not
alleged.
now,
the
--
i
--
i
say
the
--
the
federal
jurisdiction
was
claimed
only
on
the
basis
of
a
claim
under
the
constitutional
laws
of
united
states.
now
there
have
been
so
many
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
--
that
is
exactly
the
point
that
was
left
open
in
the
tp&w
case
and
discovery
incidentally,
i
must
apologize
for
the
fact
that
i
have
overlooked
that
fact
in
courts
below
and
it
came
to
my
attention
in
the
course
of
the
preparation
of
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
and
therefore
the
question
was
raised.
as
i
said
the
taking
effects
out
of
sequence,
out
of
context
and
drawing
inferences
form
them
has
lead
i
believe
to
a
considerable
degree
of
confusion
as
to
what
the
facts
actually
were
and
how
this
controversy
arose
and
i
believe
that
i
can
be
of
greatest
assistance
to
the
court
if
i
first
take
a
little
time,
in
fact
a
fair
amount
of
time
to
review
in
some
details
the
actual
sequence
of
the
events
that
lead
to
this
controversy
and
this
litigation.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
it
will
include
the
jurisdictional
problem
but
i
think
it
is
necessary
for
the
understanding
of
any
of
the
issues
in
the
case
that
the
court
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it's
completely
clear,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
think
this
is
in
one
of
these
vague
areas
in
which
i'm
not
quite
sure
of
what
the
holdings
of
this
court
indicate.
now,
this
controversy
began
when
on
december
the
23rd,
1957,
the
union,
pursuant
to
section
6
of
the
railway
labor
act
served
a
formal
notice
on
the
carrier
in
which
it
proposed
to
amend
the
existing
agreement
by
including
the
rule
which
i
have
already
quoted
that
is
that,
“no
position
in
existence
on
december
3rd,
1957,
will
be
abolished
or
discontinued
except
by
agreement
between
the
carrier
and
the
organization.”
now,
prior
to
that
date,
and
since
mr.
ben
heineman
had
taken
over
the
management
of
the
railroad
in
--
on
april
the
1st,
1956,
approximately
a
year-and-half
before,
the
total
employment
had
been
reduced
from
26,000
approximately
to
approximately
18,000.
and
that
reduction
in
employment
had
included
some
100
positions
of
the
telegrapher's
class
other
than
the
station
agency
positions.
also,
the
railroad
had
applied
on
november
the
5th,
1957
to
the
south
dakota
public
utilities
commission
for
permission
to
close
69
stations
in
south
dakota
or
alternatively,
if
it
proved
feasible
to
close
53
stations
and
enlarge
the
agents'
assignments
at
16
others
to
include
limited
service
at
the
closed
stations.
hearings
in
south
dakota
had
not
then
concluded.
now,
you
may
wonder
why
i'm
diverting
to
the
proceedings
in
south
dakota,
the
reason
is
that
throughout
this
case,
the
carrier,
the
railroad
has
taken
the
position
that
actually
this
strike
was
not
motivated
by
the
refusal
of
the
carrier
to
bargain
under
section
6
proposal,
but
was
really
a
protest
against
the
railroad
station
agency
problem
and
was
in
protest
or
for
the
purpose
of
frustrating
orders
of
state
commissions.
therefore,
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
court
have
in
mind
that
at
the
time
this
proposal
was
made,
over
a
100
non-agency
positions
have
been
lost
and
the
proposal
to
close
agencies
had
been
made
only
in
south
dakota,
hearings
in
south
dakota
had
not
yet
been
concluded
and
of
course
no
action
by
the
south
dakota
commission
had
been
taken,
and
that
was
the
posture
in
which
the
section
6
notice
was
served.
now
incidentally
i
should
have
stated
earlier
that
virtually
all
the
facts
that
i'm
reviewing
are
to
be
found
in
the
court
of
appeal
--
in
the
district
court's
findings
of
facts
and
some
inclusion
of
law
which
appear
at
page
351
and
following
of
the
printed
record
that
is
before
you.
now,
after
the
service
of
this
notice,
the
railroad
refused
to
bargain.
it
flatly
refused
to
entertain
the
proposal.
that
is
borne
out
by
finding
number
four
on
page
352
of
the
record.
the
letter
of
december
24th
there
referred
to
appears
on
page
34
of
the
record
and
it
will
be
noted
that
the
reason
for
the
refusal
to
bargain
by
simply
the
carrier
regarded
here
is
not
a
proper
subject
for
bargaining
and
the
use
of
patient
of
management
prerogatives
and
it
made
no
mention
of
any
of
the
other
reasons
that
were
later
adduced
for
its
refusal
to
bargain.
subsequently,
as
finding
number
four
also
points
out
this
same
position
was
reiterated
in
discussions
and
in
correspondence.
on
january
the
27th,
1958,
as
finding
number
five
points
out,
the
union
notified
the
railroad
that
it
would
have
to
treat
the
railroad's
actions
as
a
refusal
to
bargain
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
that
it
would
proceed
further
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act.
in
accordance
with
that
announced
position,
the
union
on
february
the
5th,
1958
invoked
the
services
of
the
national
mediation
board
that
is
covered
by
finding
number
6.
now,
i
would
like
to
read
specifically
finding
numbers
7,
which
says
the
on
the
date
of
february
24th,
1958,
the
national
mediation
board
by
its
executive
secretary
addressed
a
letter
to
the
director
of
personnel
and
the
plaintiff,
mr.
tm
van
battan
and
to
the
president
of
the
telegraphers
g.e.
leighty
advising
that
the
application
filed
by
the
telegraphers
has
been
reviewed
by
the
board,
advising
further
that
the
board
considered
that
apparently
at
proper
section
6
notice
has
been
filed
in
this
manner
and
accordingly,
the
board
have
docketed
the
application
as
case
number
25696
and
that's
a
typographical
error
that
should
be
number
a-5696
as
would
appear
from
the
record
at
page
43.
i
call
the
attention
specifically
to
the
reaction
of
the
mediation
board
because
insofar
as
there
is
any
room
for
administrative
determination,
as
to
what
is
a
proper
subject
to
be
entertained
under
the
railway
labor
act,
this
is
it.
now,
there's
no
specific
finding
that
is
bargainable,
and
that
is
subject
of
mandatory
bargaining
as
mr.
elson
pointed
out
in
the
district
court
in
response
to
a
question.
but
insofar
as
there
is
room
for
an
administrative
determination
under
the
railroad
labor
act,
the
board
after
reviewing
the
application
from
mediation
wrote
to
party
saying
that
apparently,
a
proper
section
6
notice
had
been
served.
pursuant
to
the
docketing
of
the
case,
mediation
was
actively
progressed
under
the
assignment
of
the
mediator
from
may
the
22nd
to
may
the
26th,
1958.
that
is
not
included
in
the
findings
of
fact
but
appears
from
the
testimony
undisputed
appearing
at
page
154
of
the
record.
now
at
this
point,
i
need
again
to
diverge
from
the
exact
sequence
of
events
shown
in
the
progression
of
the
case
because
mr.
heineman
testified,
and
it's
not
disputed,
that
on
may
the
26th
while
the
mediation
was
going
on
in
chicago,
then
his
director
personnel
mr.
van
batten
was
there
representing
the
railroad,
and
vice
president
of
the
union
was
there
representing
the
--
representing
the
organization.
on
that
date
in
madison,
wisconsin,
mr.
heineman
had
a
brief
conversation
in
the
car
near
the
state
office
building
with
mr.
leighty,
the
president
of
the
union
and
me.
during
this
conversation,
according
to
his
testimony
and
we
don't
deny
it,
he
asked
us
whether
we
would
care
to
discuss
the
central
agency
problem,
and
made
no
offer
to
discuss
the
section
6
notice,
but
having
recently
procured
authority
of
the
south
dakota
commission
of
close
53
stations
that
enlargely
assigned
with
others,
he
wanted
to
know
whether
we
were
--
would
like
to
talk
about
the
central
agency
plan.
we
thought
we
were
too
far
apart
to
talk
about
it.
and
i
think
the
best
evidence
that
this
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
--
with
the
proposed
contract
change
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
although
the
mediation
was
going
on
that
date
in
chicago,
neither
mr.
heineman
nor
mr.
leighty
reported
the
conversation
to
their
representatives
who
were
conducting
or
representing
their
respective
organizations
in
the
mediation
conferences.
it
was
something
entirely
apart.
now,
the
reason
i
mention
that
is
that
that
incident
has
been
used
in
this
court
by
the
railroad
to
seek
to
create
the
impression
that
it
was
the
union
rather
than
the
railroad
that
was
refusing
to
bargain
whereas
the
record
is
perfectly
planned
from
the
acknowledgment
by
the
railroad
of
the
very
first
letter
that
the
union
wrote
namely
on
december
the
24th,
1957
that
the
railroad
positively
and
consistently
refused
to
bargain.
and
it
was
admitted
in
the
testimony
by
mr.
heineman
that
he
never
had
agreed
to
bargain
upon
this
particular
proposal.
and
it
is
also
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
we
didn't
turned
down
any
proposal
by
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
what
mr.
heineman
had
said
he
was
willing
to
discuss
with
us
was
the
program
when
he
had
to
outline
of
which
by
this
time
had
developed
or
include
several
other
states
besides
south
dakota,
although
proceedings
in
other
states
except
south
dakota
was
still
going
forward.
and
he
was
willing
to
discuss
the
impact
of
that
problem
upon
the
employees
represented
by
the
union.
and
with
that
that
--
i
mean,
we
went
too
far
apart
on
that
subject
to
enter
into
any
negotiations
upon
it.
now,
at
page
2
of
our
reply
brief,
we
have
quoted,
“testimony
of
mr.
heineman
and
which
i
cite
he
had
mentioned
that
he
had
consistently
refused
to
bargain
upon
the
particular
proposal
that
we
make.”
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
is
correct.
one
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
the
proposal.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
sure,
sure
mr.
justice.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
think
not.
i
would
come
to
that
in
the
course
of
the
argument,
but
i
don't
get
that
the
railway
labor
act
can
be
subordinated
to
the
actions
of
state
commissions.
i
have
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes,
sir.
and
that's
a
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
is
in
our
view
with
this,
that's
right.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
i
think
that
makes
a
big
difference.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
mr.
heineman's
testimony
was
as
it
appears
at

of
the
record,
you
understood
my
testimony
correctly
that
after
the
proposed
rule
of
the
order
of
railroad
telegraphers
served
in
december
of
1957,
i
personally
participated
in
making
the
decision
that
the
telegraphers
should
be
told
then
it
is
not
a
bargainable
subject
matter.
i
was
then
fully
aware
of
that
attitude
of
the
carrier
from
its
inception.
that
attitude
on
the
party
--
on
the
particular
rule
has
not
been
modified
nor
in
my
opinion,
can
it
be.

the

of
the
27th,
1958.
arbitration
was
proffered
as
the
mediation
board
has
required
to
do
as
its
last
final
act
when
in
finds
that
it
cannot
resolve
the
controversy
and
both
parties
declined
the
arbitration.
accordingly,
on
july
the
10th,
1958,
as
shown
by
finding
number
10,
the
union
initiated
a
strike
both
among
its
membership
and
received
almost
unanimous
authorization
to
call
a
strike
over
the
failure
and
refusal
of
the
railroad
to
bargain
about
this
issue.
strike
call
and
instructions
were
issued
to
the
membership
on
august
the
18th
calling
a
strike
for
august
the
21st
and
that's
covered
by
finding
number
11.
now,
on
that
same
day,
august
the
18th,
the
national
mediation
board,
although
it
had
previously
completely
processed
the
case
through
the
normal
procedures
have
mediated
it
and
it
concluded
that
it
could
not
resolve
the
issues
and
proffered
arbitration
as
its
last
required
act,
again,
entered
the
case
on
an
emergency
basis
which
it
frequently
does
when
a
strike
is
eminent
and
adopted
in
this
case,
this
new
entry
into
the
matter
as
its
docket
number
e175.
that
appears
in
finding
number
12
and
it
mediated
the
case
from
the
--
under
that
emergency
intervention
until
august
20th,
1958,
the
day
before
that
the
date
set
for
the
strike.
on
august
the
20th,
it
again
withdrew
and
the
strike
was
set
to
begin
the
following
morning.
i
mention
this
emergency
mediation
particularly
because
it
too,
gives
rise
to
an
issue
in
the
case.
as
i
indicated
in
description
of
the
district
court's
decision,
the
district
court
denied
any
prominent
injunction.
he
did
however
feel
that
the
reentry
into
them
abide
the
mediation
board
in
to
the
case
on
the
eve
of
the
strike
set
a
second
30-day
waiting
period
into
operation,
and
that
therefore,
the
strike
would
have
to
be
postponed
until
september
the
19th
and
they
issued
that's
--
an
injunction
accordingly
until
september
the
19th,
1958
enjoining
the
strike
until
that
date.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
what
--
what
the
court
did
in
its
order
which
appears
at
page
259
is
first
to
order
the
injunction
of
issue
until
midnight
september
19,
1958.
following
that
is
that
it
is
further
ordered
that
the
prayer
for
injunctive
relief
extending
beyond
september
the
19th,
1958
and
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no
that's
–-
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no,

i'm
sorry.
it
is
further
ordered
that
the
prayer
for
injunctive
relief
extending
beyond
september
19,
1958
and
any
other
relief
prayed
for
in
the
complaint
is
amended
and
it
this
hereby
denied
and
except
for
the
relief
here
in
above
given
the
complaint
as
amended
is
hereby
dismissed.
now,
on
the
same
day
mediation
board
terminated
its
emergency
service
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
surely.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
oh,
yes.
that
--
by
that.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
as
to
the
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
a
certain
power
as
to
the
propriety,
as
to
--
and
if
an
appeal
was
taken
from
that
portion
of
the
order
as
well
as
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
i
don't
think
i
have
either,
but,
i
--
i
don't
see
that
there's
anything
basically
improper
about
it
except
the
30-day
restraint
that
--
and
also
on
the
same
day
that
the
--
that
the
mediation
board
terminated
its
services
on
august
20th.
this
--
the
complaint
in
this
action
was
filed
in
the
district
court
and
the
motion
for
temporary
restraining
order
also
filed.
the
court
heard
arguments
on
the
motion
for
temporary
restraining
order
throughout
the
day
and
throughout
the
afternoon
of
august
20th
and
at
the
close
of
the
day,
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
continued
the
hearing
for
the
next
several
days.
at
this
point,
another
diverting
factor
enters
in.
the
railroad
on
august
the
21st,
the
day
after
the
litigation
had
began,
the
day
after
the
temporary
restraining
order
had
been
issued
wrote
a
letter
to
the
union
saying
your
proposal
of
december
23rd
is
in
violation
of
article
6,
of
the
national
mediation
agreement
of
november
1,
1956.
now
article
6
of
the
mediation
agreement
of
november
1,
1956
set
a
term
on
certain
kinds
of
proposals
such
as
wages,
overtime
payments,
changes
and
rights
of
pay,
changes
in
health
and
welfare
payments
which
would
not
be
proposed
for
change
until
after
november
1,
1959.
proposals
relating
the
stabilization
of
employment
were
expressly
accepted
from
article
6
and
as
i
say
this
was
raised
for
the
first
time
after
the
proposal
had
been
before
the
railroad
for
well
over
nine
months,
after
the
strike
had
been
called,
after
the
litigation
had
been
begun,
and
the
temporary
restraining
order
had
been
issued,
the
railroad
also
announced
its
proposal
to
submit
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
the
question
of
whether
the
proposal
was
in
violation
of
article
6
of
the
1956
agreement.
this
was
obviously
an
opportunistic
and
belated
effort
to
invoke
the
authority
of
the
chicago
river
case.
and
the
reason
for
this
particular
submission
is
very
easy
to
trace
because
in
the
argument
in
the
district
court,
the
day
before,
with
respect
to
the
temporary
retraining
order,
the
railroad
had
argued
that
the
real
heart
of
this
controversy
is
the
union's
claims
that
the
station
agency
program
would
give
rise
to
claims
under
the
existing
agreement.
and
therefore,
the
court
should
look
behind
this
proposal
to
amend
the
contract
and
should
enjoin
the
strike
on
the
authority
of
the
chicago
river
case.
we
responded
that
even
though
--
even
if
you
assume
that
the
railroad
is
right
in
its
inferences,
still
it's
not
with
chicago
river
case
because
as
this
court's
decision
a
few
weeks
after
the
chicago
river
case
pointed
out
in
manion
against
the
kansas
city
terminal
railway
company
that
the
chicago
river
case
is
predicated
upon
claims
being
pending
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
they
had
no
claims
pending
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
with
respect
to
violations
of
existing
contracts.
not
only
that,
they
were
not
in
a
position
to
submit
even
belatedly
and
opportunistically
any
claims
about
violation
of
the
existing
contract
because
they
had
no
such
claims
on
the
property.
they
had
no
controversy
on
the
property
about
it.
so
in
order
to
get
around
the
manion
case
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
the
--
the
organization
have
made
no
claims
that
the
station
agency
program
violated
the
existing
agreement.
there
was
--
there
was
disagreement
about
that
but
--
but
no
claims
had
been
filed
on
the
management
for
any
violation
existing
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
the
mediation
agreement
of
1956
contains
amendments
to
existing
agreements
of
some
15
organizations
on
a
national
basis
with
the
railroads
represented
by
carriers
conference
committees.
those
amendments
related
to
rates
of
pay
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
including
chicago
north
western
and
that
dealt
primarily
with
rates
of
pay
and
revisions
in
the
health
and
wealth
program.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes.
that
occurs
frequently
in
the
railroad
industry
mr.
justice
whittaker.
it's
the
only
industry
that
i
know
of
where
it
happens
with
such
frequency.
our
basic
agreements
continue
from
year
to
year
and
are
amended
from
time
to
time
and
sometimes
by
joint
agreements
which
in
this
case
should
have
15
unions
and
about
a
150
railroads.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
they
continue
automatically
until
somebody
serves
the
notice
to
change
it
under
the
railway
labor
act
which
requires
a
30-day
notice.
so,
quite
obviously
because
the
railroad
was
not
in
the
position
to
put
before
the
adjustment
board
any
claims
under
the
existing
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it
felt
nevertheless,
that
by
asserting
on
each
part,
a
violation
by
the
union
of
the
national
mediation
agreement
that
it
could
generate
a
controversy
that
it
could
then
submit
to
the
adjustment
board
and
come
in
and
say,
“now
we
have
a
dispute
pending.”
are
they
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
actually
the
exactly,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
--
that's
right,
that's
right.
and
the
--
on
--
on
that
point
incidentally,
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
no
dispute
giving
rise
to
this
part
was
a
minor
dispute
and
found
specifically
that's
been
the
dispute
that
did
give
rise
to
the
attempted
strike
was
the
proposal
from
contract
amendment.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
if
i
can.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
there
is
no
challenge
to
any
on
the
findings
with
the
exception
of
the
last
sentence
of
finding
number
17.
that
--
that
finding
is
a
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right
and
the
challenge
there
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
evidence
on
which
that
particular
sentence
was
based
on
those
copies
of
two
agreements
which
are
identical
in
substance
to
the
proposal
here
involved
except
that
they
are
for
a
term
instead
of
they,
as
in
this
proposal
indefinite
with
subject
to
revision
at
any
time.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
believe
it
was
although
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
--
i
don't
think
so,
but
with
that
one
exception,
the
brief
here
says
that
they
are
challenging
none
other
findings.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
now,
the
hearings
before
the
district
court
continued
with
some
interruptions
until
september
the
5th,
1958
and
under
extensions
of
the
temporary
restraining
order,
that
appears
from
the
documentaries
on
the
first
page
of
the
record.
on
september
the
5th,
the
district
court
rendered
its
opinion
which
as
i
have
already
indicated,
denied
injunctive
relief
beyond
september
the
19th
but
granted
injunctive
relief
until
that
date.
that
was
on
friday
and
so,
by
mutual
agreement,
the
entry
of
the
final
decree
and
findings
in
order
was
postponed
until
monday,
september
the
8th
so
as
to
give
both
sides
an
opportunity
to
draft
proposed
findings
and
decree.
now,
in
addition
to
the
findings
that
i
have
already
referred
to
under
my
discussion
of
the
facts,
i
would
like
to
make
a
number
of
other
significant
findings,
beginning
with
the
finding
number
17
on
page
356
of
the
record.
the
court
found
number
17,
the
proposed
contract
change
incorporated
on
the
section
6
notice
served
by
the
defendant
to
(inaudible)
on
december
23rd,
1957
relates
to
the
length
or
term
of
employment
as
well
as
stabilization
of
employment.
collective
bargaining
as
to
the
length
of
term
of
employment
is
common
place.
there
are
a
variety
of
collective
bargaining
provisions
in
the
railroad
industry
relating
to
stabilization
of
employment
as
such
including
provisions
for
severance
allowance,
supplementary
unemployment
compensation
benefits
and
guaranteed
employment.
the
latter
provision
in
one
instance
goes
back
more
than
30
years
and
then
the
challenged
finding
of
the
contract
provision
substantially
identical
to
the
rule
proposed
here
--
proposed
by
the
defendant
to
(inaudible)
are
in
existence
on
at
least
two
railroads
and
as
i
understand,
the
challenge
goes
to
the
substantial
identity
rather
than
for
the
existence
on
the
agreements.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no.
no,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturb
any
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
18
in
the
contract
changed
proposed
by
defendant
(inaudible)
in
the
section
6
notice
of
december
23,
1957
relates
to
rates
of
pay
rules
and
working
conditions
and
these
are
bargaining
relations
under
the
railway
labor
act.
19,
the
dispute
giving
rise
to
the
proposed
strike
goes
out
on
the
failure
of
the
parties
to
reach
agreement
on
the
proposed
contract
change
incorporated
on
the
section
6
notice
served
by
defendant
(inaudible)
by
the
plaintiff
on
december
23rd,
1957.
20,
the
plaintiff
has
refused
to
negotiate,
infer,
mediate
or
otherwise
treat
with
defendant
(inaudible)
on
the
proposed
change
and
agreement
set
forth
in
the
section
6
notice
served
by
defendant
to
(inaudible)
on
plaintiff
on
december
23rd,
1957.
the
plaintiff
did
show
willingness
to
negotiate
upon
the
central
agency
plan
including
a
possibility
concerning
severance
pay.
that
last
sentence
grows
out
of
the
conversation
with
mr.
heineman
in
madison,
wisconsin
on
may
the
26th.
21,
the
dispute
giving
rise
to
the
proposed
strike
is
a
major
dispute
and
not
a
minor
agreement
under
the
railway
labor
act.
there
is
no
issue
involved
there
and
is
properly
referable
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
from
the
various
findings,
the
court
concluded
as
a
matter
of
law,
first
that
the
complaint
as
amended
fails
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted
except
for
the
issuance
of
an
injunction
expiring
at
midnight,
september
19,
1958
to
the
defendant
to
(inaudible)
serving
and
progressing
in
section
6
notice
of
december
3rd
--
23rd
1957
has
conformed
to
all
the
procedures
and
requirements
of
the
railway
labor
act.
three,
no
issue
no
involved
in
the
proposed
strike
which
plaintiff
seeks
to
enjoin
is
properly
referable
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
four,
the
proposal
contained
in
section
6
notice
served
on
december
23,
1957
by
the
defendant
to
(inaudible)
upon
the
plaintiff
presents
an
issue
which
is
a
proper
subject
of
negotiation
and
is
bargainable
under
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act.
five,
the
proffer
of
services
on
an
emergency
basis
by
the
national
mediation
board
and
its
acceptance
by
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
to
(inaudible)
initiated
the
new
30-day
cooling
off
period
under
the
railway
labor
act
running
from
the
termination
of
such
services
on
august
20,
1958.
sixth,
the
court
is
without
jurisdiction
to
grant
injunctive
relief
except
for
an
injunction
expiring
at
midnight,
september
19,
1958.
and
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes,
indeed.
i
think
it
is
--
it
is
clear
that
from
the
argument
before
the
court
which
on
our
part
was
devoted
almost
entirely
to
the
norris-laguardia
act
by
the
conclusion
number
six.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
there
is
in
the
opinion,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
opinion
of
the
court
appears
at
page
165
and
following
and
i
think
--
and
i
think
it's
there
indicated
that
the
--
the
finding
number
six
is
predicated
on
the
norris-laguardia
act.
it
is
also
apparent
from
the
issues
before
the
court
particularly
the
issues
raised
by
our
answer
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
invoked
and
is
the
basis
for
our
conclusion
number
six
that
the
court
is
without
jurisdiction
to
grant
injunctive
relief
except
for
an
injunction
expiring
at
midnight,
september
the
19th,
1958.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well
i
--
i
can
--
i
can
understand
your
difficulty
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
morning
i
struck
out
of
my
notes
an
argument
predicated
upon
that.
and
the
union
appealed
from
a
temporary
restraining
order
on
the
basis
by
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
from
the
continuances
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
and
from
the
injunction
to
september
the
19th.
the
railroad
on
the
other
hand
appealed
from
the
denial
of
permanent
relief
and
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint.
then
on
september
the
16th,
1958
having
filed
the
appeal,
the
railroad
appeared
before
the
district
court
and
sought
an
injunction
pending
appeal
pursuant
to
rule
62
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
court,
although
very
much
troubled
about
its
jurisdiction
to
grant
such
an
injunction
under
the
norris-laguardia
act,
having
just
held
eight
days
before
that
it
was
without
further
jurisdiction
in
the
matter,
nevertheless
granted
an
injunction
pending
appeal.
the
difficulty
that
the
court
had
with
respect
to
this
inconsistency
between
its
having
held
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
beyond
september
the
19th
is
set
forth
in
the
record
at
page
369.
the
court
said
it
was
very
much
troubled
about
whether
he
has
jurisdiction.
he
doesn't
want
to
exceed
his
jurisdiction.
he
recognizes
the
inconsistency
between
holding
that
he
has
no
jurisdiction
and
still
exercising
jurisdiction
purportedly
under
rule
62
(c)
in
clear
contravention
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
nevertheless,
the
injunction
was
issued
and
the
union
then
amended
its
notice
of
appeal
to
include
appeal
from
the
injunction
pending
appeal.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes,
it
is.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no.
both
the
injunction
until
september
the19th
and
the
injunction
pending
appeal
are
not
moot
because
in
both
cases,
bond
was
posted
in
the
amount
of
in
the
amount
of
$50,000.
and
if
those
injunctions
were
wrongfully
issued
we're
entitled
in
these
very
procedures
and
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
to
recover
under
the
bond.
and
the
issue
as
to
both
injunctions
was
preserved
on
appeal
and
although
not
specifically
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
necessarily
disposed
of
by
its
holding
that
a
permanent
injunction
should
have
issued.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes,
i
--
you
are
right.
i
thought
mr.
justice
harlan's
first
question
was,
is
the
issue
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
--
now,
that
--
that
completes
the
resume
of
the
facts
up
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
i
have
already
outlined.
i
--
my
time
is
running
short.
i
want
to
reserve
a
little
time
for
rebuttal
so
i'm
going
to
have
to
be
rather
rapid
in
my
discussion
of
the
legal
issues.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes.
i
think
the
--
the
legal
issues
are
before
you
are
in
the
first
place
whether
this
proposal
presents
a
bargainable
issue
under
the
railway
labor
act.
if
it
does,
then
i
think
some
of
the
other
tendered
issues
disappear
because
in
that
case,
i'd
take
it
there
would
be
no
doubt
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
applicable
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
limited
by
the
terms
of
that
act.
even
it
is
our
position
that
even
if
no
proposals
for
compulsory
bargainability
under
the
railway
labor
act
is
presented,
it
nevertheless
does
not
follow
that
there's
anything
illegal
about
making
the
proposal
or
anything
illegal
about
striking
on
the
count
of
the
carrier's
refusal
to
bargain
about
it
nor
any
reason
to
hold
the
norris-laguardia
act
inapplicable
to
the
resulting
labor
dispute.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
but
then
i
see
no
--
i
--
i
think
then
the
issue
as
to
norris-laguardia
disappears
because
norris-laguardia
clearly
is
applicable,
the
contention
that
it
is
not
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
that
then,
it
is
still
our
contention
that
there's
nothing
illegal
about
the
strike
even
if
the
railroad
didn't
have
to
bargain
with
the
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
it's
permitted
and
that
there
is
no
basis
for
holding
the
norris-laguardia
act
inapplicable
even
in
that
situation.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
think
the
difference
is
simply
this.
the
--
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
railroad
is
under
a
legal
obligation
to
bargain
with
us
on
the
one
hand
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
wait
a
minute
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
and
i
--
my
basic
position
is
exactly
what
you
have
just
stated,
mr.
justice
black,
namely
that
the
entire
area
of
interest
between
employers
and
employees
is
subject
to
bargaining
and
subject
to
mandatory
bargaining.
if
however
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
that
is
right.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
exactly
it.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well
norris-laguardia,
i
say,
is
applicable
–-
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
follows
--
norris-laguardia
is
applicable
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
--
that
is
correct
that
there
is
another
issue
which
is
imposed
and
which
the
respondent
says
is
an
independent
ground
for
sustaining
the
decision
below
is
this
related
submission
to
the
adjustment
board.
and
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes.
i'll
be
glad
to
indicate
that.
you
look
first
to
the
railway
labor
act
itself
and
you
will
find
that
section
2
first
of
the
railway
labor
act,
that's
152
in
title
45
of
the
u.s.
code
says
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
all
carriers
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
it's
title
45
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
152
first.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
it
should
be
the
duty
of
all
carriers,
their
officers,
agents,
and
employees
to
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
make
and
maintain
agreements
concerning
rates
of
pay,
rules,
and
working
conditions,
and
to
settle
all
disputes,
and
thus,
it
has
limited
to
making
agreements
concerning
rates
of
pay
rules,
and
working
conditions,
but
to
settle
all
disputes
whether
arising
out
of
the
application
of
such
agreements
or
otherwise
in
order
to
avoid
any
interruption
to
commerce
or
to
the
operation
of
any
carrier
growing
out
of
any
dispute
between
the
carrier
and
the
employees
thereof.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
secondly
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no,
i
would
not.
and
i
think
that
would
be
called
contrary
to
the
specific
prohibition
that
neither
side
shall
interfere
with
the
choice
by
the
other
of
its
representatives
under
the
act.
and
i
think
just
as
if
a
railroad
felt
that
it
required
representation
in
the
union
which
would
violate
the
counterpart
of
that
prohibition
similarly,
the
brotherhood
would
have
no
right
to
bargain
for
representation
on
the
--
on
the
board
of
directors
directly.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
i
--
i
suppose
it
is
subject
to
those
specific
limitations
contained
in
the
act.
but
i
wouldn't
recognize
any
others.
now
secondly,
you
have
27
years
of
construction
by
the
parties
of
what
this
scope
of
bargaining
is.
we
have
included
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
a
survey
what
has
been
the
subject
matter
of
bargaining
under
this
act,
a
great
variety
of
it
particularly
bargaining
without
question
until
1953
by
the
parties
over
all
sorts
of
subject
matter
especially
stable
as
action
of
employment.
and
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
yes,
that's
what
i
call
the
ultimate
version
that
they've
cast
on
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
entirely
true,
that
is
not
in
the
record,
this
is
a
matter
of
public
information
that
shall
--
that
contemporaneous
construction
of
the
law
by
the
parties.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right
and
beginning
at
page
57
of
that
brief,
we
have
also
assembled
what
has
happened
since
1953
when
this
issue
of
the
limited
conception
of
bargainability
was
first
raised
with
respect
to
our
health
and
welfare
proposals.
you
will
note
from
that
tabulation
that
with
respect
to
over
50
proposals
since
1953,
the
railroads
have
raised
this
issue
of
non-bargainability.
it
has
become
a
regular
tactic
of
bargaining
puts
all
that
issue
into
the
picture.
so
that
the
railroad
--
the
union
is
put
in
the
position
where
it
must
take
what
the
railroad
wants
or
face
litigation
upon
that
issue.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
only
a
few
moments
left
and
i
would
like
to
devote
that
to
seeing
whether
i
can
shed
some
light
on
the
matters
that
have
just
recently
been
under
discussion
with
mr.
mcgowan.
we
have
cited
on
page
7
of
our
reply
brief,
the
railroads
proposed
finding
number
five.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
is
not
in
the
printed
record,
it
was
there
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
--
i
think
not.
i
think
not
--
not
in
this
portion
of
it.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
think
it
can.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i'm
--
i
--
i
think
it
probably
should
be.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
(laughter)
in
--
insofar
as
it's
in
our
power
to
do
so,
and
i
think
it
is.
it
--
it
will
be.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
not
at
all,
not
all.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
the
proposed
finding
reads,
“this
proposal,
section
6
notice
was
prompted
by
and
was
directly
addressed
to
plaintiff's
action
in
announcing
and
moving
to
seek
authority
for
its
central
agency
plan.
and
the
threatened
strike
founded
on
this
proposal
results
from
the
central
agency
plan.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
the
proposed
finding
which
was
rejected
by
judge
perry
and
instead
judge
perry
made
the
findings
that
we
have
already
referred
to.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
page
7
in
the
footnote.
judge
perry
instead
specifically
found
that
the
dispute
giving
rise
to
the
proposed
strike
grows
out
of
the
failure
of
the
parties
to
reach
agreement
on
the
proposed
contract
change
incorporated
in
the
section
6
notice
served
by
defendant
telegraphers
on
the
plaintiff
on
december
23,
1957.
now
as
to
the
effect
the
proposal
might
have
in
frustrating
orders
of
state
commissions
as
mr.
mcgowan
is
fond
of
saying,
bear
in
mind
that
in
each
of
these
states
where
it
was
sought
to
put
the
central
agency
plan
into
effect,
it
was
upon
the
carrier's
initiative.
the
state
commissions
announced
no
policy
that
you
ought
to
close
up
the
stations
in
this
state.
the
carrier
went
to
the
state
commissions
and
asked
permission
to
close
certain
stations
and
that
permission
was
granted
in
every
state
except
south
dakota
where
the
matter
was
acted
upon.
the
order
is
expressly
--
permits
them.
in
south
dakota,
the
commission
conceived
the
notion
that
it
could
relieve
the
railroad
from
any
necessity
of
bargaining
with
the
telegraphers
(inaudible)
and
its
original
order
included
that
it
should
pay
only
one
day's
pay
to
a
man
serving
at
a
number
of
stations.
we
brought
an
injunction
suit
against
that
order
in
sioux
falls,
south
dakota.
statutory
review
was
not
a
available
because
the
commission
was
sitting
on
our
motion
for
reconsideration
which
is
a
prerequisite
to
statutory
review.
but
our
grounds
for
injunction
were
--
at
least
included
that
this
was
an
interference
with
the
collective
bargaining
under
the
railway
labor
act.
when
that
suit
was
filed,
the
south
dakota
commission
amended
its
order
expressly
to
declare
that
it
was
not
intended
in
anyway
to
interfere
with
collective
bargaining
under
the
railway
labor
act.
however,
it
seems
to
me
that
even
if
the
states
assume
to
tell
the
railroads
what
their
wages
and
working
conditions
would
be,
what
the
economies
they
should
affect
by
reductions
in
pay,
reductions
in
jobs,
most
anything
of
that
sort
would
conceivably
be
within
the
commission's
province.
if
it
did
that,
it
would
if
such
an
order
could
not
stand
because
it
would
be
in
conflict
with
the
collective
bargaining
obligations
of
the
railroad
under
the
railway
labor
act.
now
this
court
held
in
california
against
taylor
that
even
a
state-owned
railroad
where
rates
of
pay
had
been
fixed
pursuant
to
the
civil
service
laws
of
the
state
the
railway
labor
act
governs
and
even
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
pursuant
to
that
law
superseded
the
state
law.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
there
is
nothing
i
know
of
that
even
suggests
that,
that
is
that
they
would
defy
valid
orders.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
sure.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
correct.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
always
in
the
exercise
of
that
power
disclaimed
any
notion
that
it
could
interfere
with
rights
of
pay
rules
or
working
conditions
as
determined
under
the
railway
labor
act.
in
fact
we
have
cited
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
could
--
could
it
say
that
without
such
a
provision
as
we
were
here
proposing?
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
in
the
absence
of
--
of
an
existing
rule--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i've
--
in
an
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice,
i
--
i
think
in
the
absence
of
some
collective
agreement
such
as
here
proposed,
the
commission
could
probably
do
that.
however
if
our
proposal
here
were
in
effect
as
part
of
a
collective
agreement,
i
think
the
extent
to
which
the
commission
could
go
would
be
to
order
the
railroad
to
try
to
get
rid
of
these
redundant
jobs
pursuant
to
the
established
agreement.
i
do
not
think
it
could
tell
the
railroad
to
violate
its
agreement
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
and
--
and
there's
an
interesting
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right
if
--
if
it
were
in
there
now
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
there
are
in
the
record
two
agreements
with
the
railroad
yardmasters
of
america
by
two
different
railroads
which
the
--
which
judge
perry
was
lie
--
relying
upon
in
the
final
sentence
of
finding
number
17
when
he
said
that
there
were
at
least
two
agreements
in
effect
substantially
identical
to
this
proposal.
the
carrier
challenges
that
finding
and
says
the
agreements
are
not
substantially
identical
because
of
a
difference
in
their
duration.
they
are
for
a
fixed
period
whereas
our
proposal
was
for
a
continuing
agreement
subject
to
change
on
30
days
notice
as
provided
in
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no
i
don't
think
that's
true
mr.
justice.
the
--
the
findings
as
such
were
not
challenged
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
read
the
opinion
did
not
set
aside
any
findings
of
--
of
judge
perry
insofar
as
they
applied
to
particular
facts.
they
disagreed
with
the
conclusion
as
mr.
justice
black
has
pointed
out
that
it
related
to
rates,
pay
rules
and
working
conditions
but
the
essential
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
judge
perry
