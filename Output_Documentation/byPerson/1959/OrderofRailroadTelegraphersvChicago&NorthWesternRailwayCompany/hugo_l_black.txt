justice
hugo
l.
black
would
mind
repeating
or
could
rebound
it
and
state
it
now
very
briefly
what
you
consider
the
legal
issues
that
we
have
to
decide?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
if
they
could
have
decided
that
you
had
the
right
to
bargain
on
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
it
decided
the
other
way,
what's
left
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
--
do
you
mean
if
it's
permitted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
those
two,
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying
that
if
you're
authorized
to
bargain
on
those
points
by
the
act
and
that
the
court
was
wrong
in
saying
so
--
even
in
wrong
in
saying
so
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
should
not
have
been
ignored.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
--
it
is
if
it
is
permitted,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
isn't
it
that
if
the
cases
decided
if
the
act
is
construed
one
way,
the
case
will
have
to
be
decided
one
way.
if
the
act
is
construe
the
other
way,
the
case
has
to
be
decided
in
another
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this,
if
it
doesn't
bother
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
precisely
on
that
point,
didn't
it?
that
this
language
didn't
permit
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
bargaining
on
the
proposal
they
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
mean
to
indicate
that
they
reversed
it
to
these
findings
of
facts.
i
meant
that
they
held
that
the
statute,
under
that
statutory
language,
this
proposal
could
not
be
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
that
depends
on
the
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
dispute
between
you
on
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
asking.
i
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
affects
a
legal
problem?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
that
motive?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
that
you
don't
have
time
this
afternoon,
i
would
like
to
get
your
idea
what
you
think
are
the
criteria
to
control
the
decision
as
whether
these
things
are
within
the
definition
of
rule
of
working
(inaudible)
and
so
forth.
do
we
have
to
look
at
the
statistics
and
practices
or
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
have
they
always
done
that?
i
suppose
some
of
the
(inaudible)
vary
from
time
to
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
in
the
context
of
the
language
that
the
court
of
appeals
construed
as
controlling
in
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you'll
permit
me
to
say
so,
i
wouldn't
--
i
was
not
assuming
as
that.
i
was
assuming
if
they
were
asked
to
sit
in
with
the
--
as
far
as
that
question
is
concerned,
with
the
representatives
of
the
railroad
in
connection
with
those
proffered
requests
might
be
requested
by
the
railroad
so
that
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
are
abandoned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
--
i
would
suppose
that
--
frankly
i
wouldn't
suppose
there'd
be
any
much
question
if
they
were
asking
you
violate
a
valid
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
assuming
--
and
i
would
not
assume
that
in
this
and
i
would
--
i'd
think
quite
differently
on
this
but
it's
something
--
you're
assuming
that
they're
saying
that
you
must
meet
with
them
and
agree
to
break
the
law
is
valid.
i
would
think
there
are
many
things
that
could
happen
before
there
becomes
a
legal
order
which
could
be
negotiated
about.
now
that
might
not
come
within
the
meaning
of
the
crucial
section
of
the
act,
but
i
would
think
there'd
be
many
things
that
you
could
negotiate
about
as
to
whether
you
would
go
actively
and
requested
on
what
position
you
would
take,
whether
you
had
resisted
if
they
asked
for
it
in
a
legal
way,
and
resisted
legally
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
that
you
would
have
worked
out
anything.
it's
a
question
to
whether
you
should
negotiate
with
them
as
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mention
with
this
and
whether
that
comes
within
the
meaning
of
those
words,
wages,
working
hours
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
when
i'm
troubled
it's
a
little
difficulty
with
justice
--
different
with
justice
frankfurter,
maybe
the
same
after
all.
what
you
have
here
is
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
setting
aside
of
the
--
the
very
statement,
the
district
court
which
had
entered
an
injunction.
the
closing
part
of
it
is
that
the
district
court's
finding,
in
the
proposed
contract
change
related
to
rates
of
pay,
rules
and
working
conditions
and
was
thus
a
bargain
of
militia
under
the
railway
labor
act
is
clearly
erroneous.
now
on
that
they
held
that
the
injunction
would
lie
despite
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
the
only
thing
it
was
proposed
was
this,
no
position
in
existence
on
december
3,
1957
would
be
abolished
or
discontinued
except
by
agreement
between
the
carrier
and
the
organization.
they
asked
you
to
negotiate
and
talk
about
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
your
issue
whether
or
not,
that
comes
within
the
term
of
which
the
pay
rules
and
working
conditions,
that's
what
they
decided?
if
it
does
come
within
it
the
injunction
was
improperly
granted
--
would
be
improperly
granted,
wouldn't
it,
under
the
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
proper
demand.
if
this
request
they
made
relates
to
the
statutory
definitions
the
court
passed
on
rates
of
pay,
rules
and
working
conditions
if
it's
included
in
it
then
why
the
proper
demand,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
only
issue
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
i
certainly,
i
agree
with
you,
it's
a
critical
issue.
now
at
the
time
they
made
this
request,
were
you
on
the
order
from
various,
all
the
states
that
this
railroad
went
to
abolish
these
officers,
these
positions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
came
after,
and
they
were
asking
you
to
negotiate
and
at
that
time
they
were
asking
you
negotiate
it
with
reference
to
whether
you'd
make
an
agreement
which
if
you
had
made,
would've
required
you
to
withdraw
your
application
from
the
state
i
suppose,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
that
court
you
were
negotiating
with
them
wasn't
it?
whether
you
would
make
an
agreement
with
them
and
so
far
as
you
were
concerned,
you
would
not
abolish
any
of
these
places
without
an
agreement
from
the
(inaudible)
and
why
isn't
that
the
issue
we
have
to
decide
whether
that
is
a
proper
bargainable
issue
under
the
definition
in
the
--
they
asked?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
wanted
to
find
from
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what--
what
criteria
are
we
are
to
use
in
determining
whether
that
is
a
proper
issue.
the
court
does
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
--
why
wouldn't
they?
hadn't
--
hadn't
there
been
depth
--
hadn't
there
been
a
backup
practice?
i
--
i
may
be
entirely
wrong
here
but
i
thought
just
from
a
general
idea,
it
was
common
practice
to
bargain
between
--
employers
and
employees
bargained
as
to
whether
they
would
abolish
certainly
jobs
or
not
abolish
certain
jobs.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
so-called
feather
beddings?
i
--
i
had
an
idea
that
one
great
argument
had
been
that
the
union
is
forcing
employees
to
make
this
so-called
feather
bedding
agreement.
it
was
a
bad
practice
and
there'd
been
much,
many
efforts
made
to
get
the
laws
changed
so
as
to
forbid
it,
maybe
rightly
i
don't
say,
but
i
thought
that
was
--
was
the
kind
of
thing,
perhaps
they
were
asking
you
to
argue
about
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
i'm
not
saying
if
--
if
--
can
they
negotiate
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
--
you
just
don't
want
to
grant
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
finally
get
back
to
the
question
of
whether
--
whether
you
--
whatever
consequence
would
be
they
have
a
right
to
try
to
negotiate
with
you
to
get
you
to
make
that
agreement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
racial
question,
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
ask
him
--
that
was
illegal
demand
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
was
the
basis
of
the
holding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
of
course
represented
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
then
it
had
come
up
to
the
courts,
and
it
was
shown
that
the
purpose
was
to
create
racial
discrimination,
of
course
i
should
think,
that
would
be
quite
a
different
thing,
the
one
which
simply
required
the
so-called
feather
bedding
contract
applying
to
everybody
alike.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
of
that
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
policy,
against
the
policy
which
may
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
may
have
to
be
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
do
you
find
anything
in
the
policy
of
congress
that
says
they
cannot
negotiate
in
order
to
try
to
preserve
certain
jobs
at
certain
places?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
one
â€“
excuse
me.
i
just
want
to
ask
you
one
question.
is
there
anything
in
the
record,
or
any
of
the
record
which
indicates
that
what
you
ask
them
to
negotiate
about
was
whether
they
would
defy
valid
orders
of
the
railroad
commissions
any
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
taking
the
position
here
that
you
could
negotiate
with
them
and
require
them
to
negotiate
to
whether
they
would
obey
a
valid
law?
