justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.
margolin,
you
started
out
by
stating
or
rather
indicated,
forgive
me,
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
a
course
of
misinterpretation
of
the
act.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
mean
on
this
exemption.
that's
what
i'm
talking
about
with
reference
to
this
case
and
not
some
other
thing.
will
you
be
good
enough
to
--
it
would
help
me,
perhaps
some
of
my
brethren,
i
don't
know
about
that,
but
it
would
help
me
greatly
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
generalize
what
you
concede
to
be
the
misconception
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
regard
to
retail
exemption
and
then
state
your
generalization
which
you
think
ought
to
guide
this
court
in
determining
what
is
within
and
what
is
without
the
retail
business
when
a
retailer
also
has
an
adjunct
wholesale
or
manufacturing
business.could
you
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
move
on
to
that,
you're
going
to
tell
us
what
the
guidance
it
should
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
whenever
there's
--
whenever
there
is
manufacturing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
although
under
the
same
head
or
the
--
the
same
business
enterprise
or
the
same
slogan
or
the
same
what
you
will,
manufacturing
is
manufacturing,
although
not
good
as
grocery
store
may
not
--
may
engage
in
it.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
manufacturing,
you
look
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
rule
that
out,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
isn't
sideline
or
mainline,
the
question
is
manufacturing
or
retailing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what's
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
may
be
a
way
out
of
this,
ms.
margolin,
one
that
often
confronts
lawyers
that
they're
all
right
on
the
law
but
then
just
the
facts
of
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
factual
position
is
you
can't
lose.
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
be
a
good
case
to
decide
without
giving
reasons.
