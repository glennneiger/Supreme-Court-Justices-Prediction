ms.
bessie
margolin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
was
brought
by
an
employee
under
section
16
(b)
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
recover
claimed
unpaid
overtime
compensation
against
the
respondent.
the
secretary
of
labor
was
not
a
party
in
the
case
and
entered
the
case
only
after
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
had
reversed
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
employee.
the
secretary
of
labor
entered
as
amicus
curiae
to
support
a
petition
for
rehearing
on
the
ground
that
the
fifth
circuit
had
misinterpreted
the
retail
establishment
exemption.
the
specific
issue
involved
in
the
case
is
whether
a
--
an
establishment
that
is
engaged
both
in
an
interior
decorating
and
furniture
--
custom
furniture
business,
as
well
as
in
fabricating
or
manufacturing
airplane
--
aircraft
parts
out
of
phenolic
to
the
plastic
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
your
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
no.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
is
what
the
court
said,
your
honor.
they
said
that
basically,
the
basic
nature
of
this
business
was
interior
decorating
and
therefore,
the
exemption
applied
regardless
of
what
else
was
carried
on,
what
other
kind
of
business
was
carried
on
in
the
establishment.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
particular
employee
was
--
the
evidence
shows,
was
engaged
virtually
exclusively
in
the
fabricating
of
the
phenolic
parts.
there
were
some
dispute
in
the
evidence,
but
the
trial
court
apparently
accepted
his
evidence
and
--
which
was
that
he
was
engaged
exclusively
in
the
fabrication
of
these
aircraft
parts.
ms.
bessie
margolin
it
could
be
that
if
these
two
businesses
were
segregable
with
different
employees,
we
would
recognize
them
as
separate
establishments.
of
course,
this
court
has
already
decided
that
there
must
be
a
physical
establishment
that
it's
the
single
physical
establishment
and
not
the
enterprise
as
a
whole
that
determines
whether
the
exemption
applies.
when
you
have
the
mix,
as
you
have
them
here,
the
question
depends
upon
whether
they
are
segregable.
now,
if,
in
this
case,
they
have
been
segregable,
the
exemption
might
apply
to
the
retail
part
of
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
there
was
no
evident
here
even
that
the
custom
furniture
business
was
retail
but
assuming
it
was
retail
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
i
think
we
can
assume
that
it
was,
although
there
--
there's
evidence
here
that
might
indicate
it
was
not
--
even
that
part
of
the
business
might
not
have
been
a
retail
establishment.
but
what
the
court
did
here
was
to
say
that
we
--
we
look
at
this
business
and
from
our
general
feeling
about
it,
we
think
this
is
basic
--
the
basic
nature
of
interior
decorating
as
retail
and
the
fact
that
more
than
25%
of
the
--
of
the
sales
are
of
aircraft
parts
is
immaterial
because
we're
looking
just
at
the
basic
nature
of
the
establishment.
we
are
interested
in
this
case,
of
course,
for
substantial
reasons
beyond
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
we
supported
the
petition
for
certiorari
because
it
was
a
closely
related
question
to
the
question
decided
in
the
kentucky
finance
case
which
was
--
how
far
did
congress
intend
to
expand
the
retail
establishment
exemption
in
the
1949
amendment.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
has
had
a
whole
series
of
cases.
i
think
this
is
about
the
fifth
in
which
it's
very
broad
--
has
been
very
broadly
interpreting
this
exemption.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
kentucky
finance
case
was
relying
upon
what
we
consider
erroneous
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit
under
this
act,
the
taylor
fertilizer
case
and
the
boisseau
case.
and
of
course,
this
court
reversed
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
kentucky
finance
case.
the
fifth
circuit
is
--
even
after
the
bekins
case
when
this
court
indicated
that
the
1949
amendment
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
expand
the
retail
establishment
exemption
to
include
wholly
new
types
of
businesses,
the
fifth
circuit
has
continued
to
rely
on
taylor
fertilizer
and
these
other
decisions.
now,
of
course,
kentucky
finance
came
down
after
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case.
but
judging
from
its
continued
reliance
on
taylor
fertilizer,
although
we
think
this
court
didn't
explicitly
reject
--
overrule
it,
we
think
that
the
bekins
decision
did
discredit
it
and
the
fifth
circuit
apparently
has
not
interpreted
the
bekins
decision
as
casting
any
doubt
on
its
earlier
decisions
interpreting
the
retail
establishment
exemption.
now,
we
believe
that
we
--
it
looks
as
if
--
unless
this
court
explicitly
overrules
these
earlier
fifth
circuit
cases,
we
think
we're
going
to
continue
to
have
trouble
in
that
circuit
with
these
decisions.
certainly,
the
lower
courts
are
going
to
continue
to
follow
them
and
the
indications
are
that
the
fifth
circuit
itself
will,
as
long
as
this
court
doesn't
say
something
explicitly
about
it.
and
this
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
this
is
not
our
case.
that's
what
i
was
reminding
the
court.
we
--
this
does,
i
think,
present
the
issue
and
presents
is
--
does
reflect
what
the
fifth
circuit
is
doing
with
this
exemption.
i
think
it
well
reflects
it.
it
is
an
employee
suit
and
it's
a
small
case.
the
judgment,
i
think,
was
only
$396
and
only
$250
attorney's
fees.
however
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
the
respondent
appealed
it.
he
didn't
pay
it.
he
appealed
it
and
he
put
the
employee
to
the
expense
of
the
appeal,
and
the
issue
is
important.
and
this
decision,
as
i
think
i
can
demonstrate
to
the
court,
does
reflect
that
the
--
what
the
fifth
circuit
is
doing
with
this
exemption
and
how
broadly
it
is
construing
it
and
how
erroneously
we
think.
he's
construing
it
erroneously,
i
think,
in
virtually
every
respect
but
there
are
four
basic
errors
which
i
think
are
reflected
in
the
decision
in
this
case.
the
first
basic
error
which
is
clearly
reflected
in
the
decision
is
very
closely
related
to
the
one
involved
in
kentucky
finance.
that
is,
the
state,
in
so
many
words
in
the
taylor
fertilizer
case,
and
they
have
followed
it
in
this
case,
that
congress,
by
the
1949
amendment,
intended
to
broadly
expand
this
exemption
to
include
manufacturing
activity.
and
that
--
on
that
score,
the
legislative
history,
and
i
think
one
of
the
difficulties
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
this
court
of
appeals
is
its
refusal
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
because
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
this
amended
exemption,
the
legislative
history
clears
up
that
ambiguity
so
far
as
the
questions
that
are
raised
in
this
case
are
concerned.
they
clear
it
up
beyond
doubt.
now,
the
--
this
first
idea
that
it
covers
manufacturing
enterprises
was
not
only
specifically
taken
care
of
by
special
provision
in
the
1949
amendment
but
the
legislative
debates,
the
house
--
the
reports
--
the
legislative
reports
specifically
pointed
out
that
section
13
(a)
(2),
which
is
the
section
the
court
held
applicable
here,
“does
not,”
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
house
report
--
house
conference
report,
“does
not
apply
to
any
manufacturing
activities
since
any
such
activities,
when
conducted
by
retail
establishments,
if
exempt,
are
intended
to
be
exempt
under
13
(a)
(4).”
now,
that
was
the
new
provision
put
in.
senator
holland
who
was
the
chief
sponsor
of
the
amendment
in
the
senate,
said
the
same
thing
that
section
13
(a)
(2)
has
no
--
has
no
item
of
manufacturing
involved.
and
the
house
conference
report
then
went
on
to
--
to
point
out
that
so
far
as
the
section
13
(a)
(4),
which
was
a
new
section
related
to
manufacturing,
any
business
that
when
engaged
in
manufacturing,
there
were
six
tests
to
be
applied.
now,
three
of
those
tests
were
the
same
ones
of
the
--
of
the
13
(a)
(2)
exemption
but
then,
there
were
three
additional
tests
for
a
business
that
also
engaged
in
manufacturing.
so
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
face
of
the
statute,
section
13
(a)
(4)
which
specifically
relates
to
this
situation,
as
well
as
from
the
legislative
history,
that
the
section
13
(a)
--
(a)
(2)
exemption
hadn't
--
has
no
application
where
manufacturing
activities
are
carried
on.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
don't
think
we
would
be
here
because
--
maybe
that
is
retail.
we
were
assuming
for
these
purposes.
we
really
don't
need
to
get
into
that
because
there's
clear
--
clear
evidence
here
that
the
manufacturing
defeated
the
exemption.
it
was
admitted
that
more
than
25%
of
the
sale.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think,
so
far
as
the
physical
premises
are
concerned,
there
was
only
one
establishment
here.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
the
record
goes
into
that.it
doesn't
show
whether
it's
separate.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
i
don't
think
you
need
to
determine
that
because
their
only
question
here
is
whether
this
particular
employee
should
have
been
denied
relief
on
the
ground
that
this
establishment,
as
a
whole,
was
exempt,
as
a
whole
was
exempt.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
don't
--
your
honor,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
get
into
that
because
whether
you
treat
this
as
one
or
two,
whether
you
treat
it
separately,
if
you
treat
it
separately,
this
employee
was
engaged
in
the
manufacturing
part
and
therefore,
he's
not
exempt.
at
--
at
most,
he
was
engaged
in
both.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
let
me
--
maybe
i
better
state
the
facts
because
i
think
that
you
are
not
stating
the
facts
accurately.
the
--
the
trial
court
found
that
it
didn't
need
to
get
into
the
question
as
to
whether
the
custom
furniture
and
the
interior
decorating.
it
didn't
have
to
get
into
that
because
more
than
25%
of
the
sales,
the
total
sales
of
this
establishment,
more
than
25%
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
if
you
treat
it
separately,
100%
of
it
was
for
--
for
the
manufacture
of
aircraft
parts
which
was
sold
to
aircraft
manufacturers,
put
in
the
subassemblies
and
shipped
out
of
the
state.
so
if
you
treat
it
as
separate
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
it's
100%,
it's
100%
non-retail.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
we
don't
know.
the
record
doesn't
show
anything
about
that.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
they
showed
that
none
of
it
--
none
of
the
sales
--
the
fifth
circuit
stated
that.
i
don't
know
if
the
record
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
don't
know
whether
this
record
will
tell
you
that.
i
don't
think
it's
--
it's
pertinent.
i
don't
think
it's
relevant
to
this
case.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
believe,
if
your
honor
will
--
it
might
take
me
too
much
time
to
demonstrate
it
here
but
i
believe
if
you
read
the
--
the
record
and
when
you
get
into
the
consideration
of
the
exemption,
you
will
conclude
that
it
is
not
material
to
the
determination
of
whether
the
exemption
applied
to
this
particular
employee.
now,
if
he
had
worked
exclusively
in
a
--
an
admittedly
retail
part
of
the
business,
if
he
had
worked
exclusively
in
that,
it
might
become
a
material
question.
but
since
he
has
worked
almost
exclusively
in
the
manufacturing
end,
it
is
not
a
material
question
because
if
it
was
--
if
the
manufacturing
is
separate,
then
100%
of
it
was
non-retail.
if
it's
part
of
the
same
establishment,
then
over
25%
of
it
--
well
over
25%,
it
was
35%
to
40%
of
the
sales
were
--
were
manufacturing
or
sales
for
resale
and
therefore,
the
--
the
exemption
for
the
whole
establishment
was
in
defeat.
so
i
think
it's
not
material.
ms.
bessie
margolin
of
this
exemption,
i
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
was
what
i
was
starting
to
do
and
i
was
trying
to
do
and
under
the
basis
--
basis
of
four
basic
errors.
the
first,
i
say,
is
they
made
a
mistake
in
saying
that
--
and
not
looking
to
--
they
looked
to
the
wrong
section.
they
should
have
looked
the
13
(a)
(4)
and
they
make
the
--
the
first
mistake
is
to
say
that
this
exemption
was
intended,
when
amended,
to
exempt
a
lot
of
things
that
weren't
before
exempt.
now,
a
business
engaged
partially
in
manufacturing
before
the
amendment,
was
well-recognized.
i
think
virtually
all
the
circuits
--
some-seven
circuits
had
held
if
they
engaged
in
manufacturing,
as
well
as
retailing,
they're
not
within
the
exemption.
well,
that
was
not
changed
by
the
--by
the
amendment
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
fifth
circuit
itself
had
recognized
that
before.
that
was
clearly
not
changed
by
the
amendment,
except
by
putting
in
a
special
section
in
13
(a)
(4).
now,
that
was
the
first
basic
error.
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
probably
would
not
abide
by
its
--
since
the
kentucky
finance
case,
because
it's
just
credit
companies
and
banks
and
whatnot.
this
court
has
held
are
not
within
the
exemption.
i
think
maybe
the
--
the
fifth
circuit
would
not
say
that
this
exemption
is
to
be
construed
as
broadly
expanding
the
--
expanded
to
new
businesses.
but
it
may
still,
unless
it's
told
otherwise,
say
that
the
manufacturing
does
not
defeat
the
exemption.
and
i
think
it
needs
to
have
gone
so
long
that
line.
its
second
basic
error
is
that
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
guidance
is
that
13
(a)
(2)
does
not
apply.
ms.
bessie
margolin
you
must
look
to
13
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
if
they're
engaging
in
some
manufacturing,
you
must
look
to
13
(a)
(4).
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right,
and
that's
the
section.
that
--
that's
the
way
i
would
handle
that
problem.
you
look
to
13
(a)
(4).
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
didn't
mention
13
(a)
(4).
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
the
respondent
knew
it
could
not
qualify
under
13
(a)
(4).
all
respondent
is
saying
here
is
because
this
is
a
sideline,
you
can't
take
it
into
account
and
this
is
apparently
what
the
fifth
circuit
did.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
say
that
the
fact
that
it
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
that
--
if
--
it
may
be
a
sideline
but
the
question
is
do
you
meet
the
requirements
of
the
statute
for
exempting
that
sideline.
and
that
the
sideline
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
is
exempt
if
it's
related
to
your
retailing
and
if
it
doesn't
comprise
more
than
25%
of
your
sales.
ms.
bessie
margolin
of
13
(a)
(4).
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right,
yes,
because
in
the
--
in
the
taylor
fertilizer
case,
i
think
you
might
also
tell
them
this
because
i
think
the
taylor
fertilizer
case
is
clearly
wrong.
there,
they
held
that
the
fertilizer
plant
manufacturing,
well,
mixing
plant,
that
that
should
be
tapped
onto
the
sales
office,
although
they
were
several
blocks
apart,
and
that
everyone
in
the
plant
was
under
the
retail
establishment
exemption
because
the
sales
office
was
a
retail
sales
office.
now,
i
think
that
is
contrary
to
this
court's
bekins
decision
which
says
that
the
physically
separate
place
of
business
is
established.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
the
court
below
relied
on
the
case
in
this
case.
they
relied
on
the
taylor
fertilizer
decision.
so
they
were
relying
on
its
--
the
general
idea
that
if
--
if
the
business
is
a
whole,
if
it
generally
seems
to
be
retail,
we're
not
going
to
look
into
whether
they
meet
all
these
tests
or
not.
that's
--
that's
been
their
approach
because
it
specifically
said,
well,
i'm
coming
to
the
second
basic
error,
that
the
1949
amendments
in
setting
forth
this
75%
test
and
saying
75%
of
the
sales
do
not
have
--
should
not
be
for
resale
and
are
recognized
in
the
industry
as
retail.
the
court
says
the
congress
just
put
that
in
as
a
guide
to
guide
us
in
determining
whether
retail
--
whether
the
establishment
is
retail
and
not
as
a
specific
criterion
that
have
to
be
met.
and
on
that,
the
legislative
history,
if
the
statute
itself
isn't
clear
because
it
says
that
it
spells
out
those
tests
in
pretty
much
detail,
but
if
there's
any
doubt
on
--
on
the
basis
of
the
terms
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
beyond
doubt,
that
those
were
to
be
prerequisites
to
exemption.
now,
the
house
conference
report
specifically
stated
that
the
amended
section
13
(a)
(2)
states
the
conditions
under
which
the
exemption
shall
apply,
and
then
points
out
that
there
are
three
specific
tests.
and
representative
lucas,
who
was
the
main
sponsor
on
the
house,
stated
explicitly,
in
summary,
the
retail
and
service
exemption
will
not
apply
under
the
proposed
amendment
unless
three
tests
are
met.
first,
over
50%
of
the
sales
must
be
made
in
the
state
in
which
the
establishment
is
located.
second,
75%
of
such
sales
must
be
to
the
ultimate
consumers
and
not
for
resale.
and
third,
75%
must
be
recognized
as
--
in
the
industry
as
retail
sales.
senator
holland
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
--
i
think
it's
about
time
we
had
some
--
some
enlightenment
on
this
--
this
1949
amendment
and
the
--
justice
whittaker
has
asked
for
a
beta
case
but
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
don't
want
to
use
your
term
that
they're
perfectly
ridiculous,
but
i
think
that
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
they'd
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
you're
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
your
--
your
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
think
the
facts
--
the
facts
here
are
certainly
sufficient
to
show
that
the
fifth
circuit's
interpretation
of
this
exemption
was
from
and
its
decision
shows
it's
from.
it's
said
enough
so
that
it's
perfectly
clear
what
it's
doing
and
there
are
five
of
--
this
is
the
fifth
decision
in
which
it's
misconstrued
this
exemption.
and
we're
having
the
lower
courts
in
that
circuit
followed
them,
and
even
the
sixth
circuit
picked
it
up
in
kentucky
finance.
we
had
the
same
case
as
used
in
the
first
circuit
in
aetna.
these
--
these
fifth
circuit
decisions
are
still
being
picked
up,
and
we
think
it's
about
time
we
had
some
clarification
about.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
exactly
the
--
so
far
as
this
particular
case
is
concerned,
that's
exactly
the
situation.
we,
of
course,
feel
that
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
this
offers
an
opportunity
to
straighten
out
the
court
and
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
show
the
other
clear
basic
areas.
and
this
is
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
what
do
you
mean
do
i
stand?
as
i
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
see
it
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
it
--
i
--
i
stand,
i
stand,
i
don't
fall
on
either.
i
stand
--
[laughter]
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
other
one
could
qualify.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
one
this
man
was
working
in
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
i
don't
say
that.
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
man
was
working
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
man
was
working
--
no,
i
say
this
man
was
working
primarily,
if
not
exclusively,
in
the
--
in
the
manufacturing
part
of
it.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
regardless
of
whether
it's
one
or
two
establishments,
he
would
not
be
subject
to
the
exemption.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
say
we're
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
if
there
are
two
establishments,
he
was
in
the
one
that's
covered
and
not
in
the
non-exempt.
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
he
was
making
aircraft
parts
almost
exclusively.
he
was
working
on
the
aircraft
parts.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
if
he
--
some
of
the
evidence
indicates
he
may
have
worked
both
places.
but
if
he
worked
both
places,
he
still
wouldn't
be
exempt
because
he
--
he's
--
if
--
he
--
having
worked
in
a
non-exempt,
if
you
work
in
a
non-exempt
work
at
the
time
in
exempt,
you're
still
not
exempt.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
it's
not
fuzzy
for
the
purposes
of
the
decision
that's
required
here
and
certainly,
that
it
didn't
justify
the
reversal
by
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
bessie
margolin
my
factual
position
is
i
can't
lose,
but
i
would
like
to
try
to
get
some
enlightenment
for
the
--
from
the
labor
department
out
of
the
case
[laughs]
too
because
while
we
didn't
get
into
this
case,
it
was
a
small
case
and
competent
counsel
handled
it,
and
he
won
it
in
the
district
court
and
we
thought
that
was
the
end
of
it.
still,
it's
--
it
is
creating
--
it's
--
it's
continuing
a
line
of
decisions
which
we
think
is
creating
a
lot
of
trouble
out
of
10
years
--
more
than
10
years
after
this
amendment
has
been
passed.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
i
hope
not.
i
hope
not.
we're
going
to
have
confusion
enough
that
[laughter]
in
some
of
our
other
problems.
i
think
that
this
decision
is
--
it's
clear
enough
what
the
fifth
circuit
is
doing
that
i
think
it
--
it
invites
an
opportunity
to
--
to
clarify.
the
third
great
error,
and
this
is
evident,
reflected
in
all
of
the
--
this
line
of
fifth
circuit
decisions,
is
that
the
burden
of
proof
of
negativing
this
exemption
in
every
case
is
on
the
administrator
or
the
employee
rather
than
on
the
employer
who's
claiming
the
exemption.
and
that's
particularly
important
in
this
exemption
because
the
amendment
never
would
have
passed,
and
anyone
reading
this
legislative
history
can
see
this
amendment
never
would
have
passed,
if
congress
hadn't
been
assured
and
reassured
emphatically,
time
and
again,
by
the
sponsors
that
the
burden
of
proving
the
--
this
exemption
in
--
before
the
administrator
and
before
the
courts,
the
burden
of
proving
was
going
to
be
on
the
employer
claiming
it
because
one,
the
--
the
objection
to
it,
and
this
was
a
--
there
was
a
great
deal
of
debate
about
this
amendment
because
the
language
seemed
to
be
so
susceptible
to
broad
interpretation
and
congress
was
afraid
that
it
would
be
greatly
--
greatly
broad
in
the
exemption
or
beyond
the
intent,
and
there
was
considerable
debate.
and
one
of
the
main
objections
was
that
the
--
these
new
tests
were
too
vague
and
they
would
open
up
the
way
for
everyone
to
claim
the
exemption.
and
senator
holland
and
representative
lucas,
senator
holland,
at
least
four
times,
stated
the
administrator
is
not
going
to
have
this
burden.
this
is
even
apart
from
the
general
rule
that
burden
of
proving
an
exemption
rests
on
the
person
claiming
it.
in
the
conference
report
of
the
senate,
“it
is
the
intent
of
the
conference
agreement
to
place
on
each
employer
claiming
the
exemption
the
burden
of
showing
that
75%
of
the
particular
establishment
sales
are
not
for
resale
and
are
recognized
as
retail
in
the
particular
industry.”
in
explanation,
senator
holland
said,
about
four
times,
an
employer
claiming
the
exemption
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
it.
i
digress
at
this
point
at
another
place,
it
says
i
digress
that
this
point
long
enough
to
remind
the
senate
that
no
additional
burden
or
duty
is
placed
on
the
administrator
but
that
to
the
contrary,
the
burden
is
placed
on
the
employer
claiming
the
exemption
to
show
that
in
fact,
75%
of
his
sales
meet
these
requirements.
this
is
not
a
test
which
the
administrator
has
to
assume.
again,
anyone
claiming
an
exemption
does
it
with
full
knowledge
that
the
burden
is
upon
him
to
establish
that
he
meets
these
tests.
and
senator
lucas
did
the
same
thing.
he
ended
up
one
long
statement
to
the
house
in
which
he
said,
“we're
not
opening
this
exemption
wide.”
he
says
“in
any
--
in
any
event”.
no
burden
is
placed
on
the
administrator.
any
employee
claiming
the
exemption
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
to
the
court
that
75%
etcetera.
now,
the
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
was.
i
think
all
these
points
--
yes,
the
burden
of
proof
point
was,
specifically.
i
--
if
i
might
have
about
one
more
minute.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
extremes
to
which
the
fifth
circuit
has
gone
in
making
the
employee
or
the
administrator
assume
this
burden
of
disproving
the
application
of
the
exemption,
i
think,
is
well
demonstrated
by
this
record
because,
here,
not
only
was
the
record
devoid
of
any
proof
that
this
establishment
was
recognized
as
a
retail
establishment
in
any
industry.
and
certainly,
the
proof
didn't
show
that
the
sales
--
that
75%
of
the
sales
were
recognized
as
retail,
devoid
of
any
proof.
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
undisputed
proof
that
more
than
25%
of
it
was
of
aircraft
parts
--
to
aircraft
manufacturers.
that's
undisputed
and
respondent
doesn't
dispute
it,
although
he
states
that
it
wasn't
proved.
he
--
he
vaguely
gets
around
it
in
some
way
which
i
can't
figure
out
because
even
the
fifth
circuit,
on
amending
--
in
--
in
its
original
opinion,
said
that
25%
of
it
was
of
aircraft
parts
for
sale
to
aircraft
manufacturers.
but
there's
no
doubt
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
--
that
the
exemption
test
were
not
met
and
still,
the
fifth
circuit
says
that
the
--
the
employee
failed
to
prove
that
25
--
what
part
of
the
25%
or
30%
was
not
for
resale.
well,
this
brings
me
to
the
fourth
basic
area,
and
i'll
treat
this
very
rapidly,
and
that
is
the
--
the
fifth
circuit's
view
that
sales
for
resale
do
not
include
sales
to
a
manufacturer
for
incorporation
into
products
which
shipped
interstate.
i
think
that
our
brief
goes
--
sufficiently
enter
that
to
show
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
clearly
wrong
in
saying
that
this
is
not
a
sale
for
resale.
i
might
--
i
promised
the
petitioner's
counsel
that
i
would,
at
least,
state
to
the
court
that
he
has
reserved
or
try
to
preserve
his
point
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
additional
attorney's
fees
for
the
court
of
appeals'
work
and
the
work
in
this
court.
he's
handled
the
case
in
forma
pauperis
to
this
court.
and
i
understand
that
he's
gone
to
considerable
expense.
and,
as
i
said,
the
government
did
not
get
into
this
case
until
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
reversed
the
district
court,
so
that
he
did
not
have
our
assistants
in
the
--
in
the
original
court
of
appeals
action.
now,
i
don't
know
that
this
court
considers
a
question
itself
of
these,
but
we
--
the
statute
is
mandatory
that
attorney's
fees,
reasonable
attorney's
fees
and
cost
should
be
grated.
and
we
think,
at
least,
it
should
be
remanded
with
directions
in
the
event
the
court
of
appeals
has
reversed
with
directions
to
allow
additional
fee,
if
available,
attorney
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court.
thank
you.
