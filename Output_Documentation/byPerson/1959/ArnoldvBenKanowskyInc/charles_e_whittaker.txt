justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
going
on
that
question,
please,
to
us,
the
one
question
in
this
case
for
me.
does
the
government
flatly
say
that
this
is
one
and
not
two
boat
establishments?
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
that
this
was
--
that
the
interior
decorating
and
custom
furniture
manufacturing
business
was
a
separate
establishment
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
and
so
treated,
rested
its
decision
on
that
fact.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
true
that
the
term
“establishment”
is
the
crucial
thing
here,
that
one
owner
might
have,
even
under
one
roof,
several
establishments,
activities
in
one
be
covered
and
in
the
other
not
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
where
do
we
find
the
better
for
you
--
couldn't
we
find
a
better
feel
for
a
cleaner
record
than
this
one
for
that
use?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
it
were
true,
ms.
margolin,
just
for
my
enlightenment
now,
if
it
were
true
that
the
interior
decorating
and
custom
furniture
manufacturing
end
of
this
work
was
a
separate
enterprise,
you
wouldn't
be
here,
would
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
able
then
unequivocally
to
tell
us
from
this
record
that
the
--
there
was
only
one
and
not
two
“establishments”?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
legally,
was
there
just
one
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
establishment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
don't
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
we
have
to
determine
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
see
how
you're
going
to
say
two
establishments
shall
be
treated
as
one
establishment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
suppose
he
were
to
--
as
i
understand
it,
if
he
were
engaged
in
the
manufacturing
end,
then
under
4,
as
nearer
through
to,
he
would
be.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
because
all
--
because,
under
this
evidence,
as
i
understand
it,
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
all
of
the
interior
decorating
and
all
of
the
custom
--
furniture
manufacturing,
as
found
by
the
fifth
circuit,
was,
number
one,
sold
at
retail
and
local.
is
that
not
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
can't
treat
it
all
as
one.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
a
whole.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now,
if
you
treat
--
just
tell
me
now,
if
you
treat
the
--
the
interior
decorating
and
custom
furniture
manufacturing
as
separate,
then
tell
me
how
much
of
that
was
sold
interstate?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
shows
that
none
was,
doesn't
it?
i
didn't
note
fifth
circuit
found.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
that's
my
trouble.
i'd
like
to
know
whether
it's
one
or
two
establishments.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
think
it
is.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
--
i'm
100%
--
let
me
just
make
this
clear.
you
are
100%
right
on
the
law
if
you're
right
on
the
facts.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
trouble
is,
here,
the
fifth
circuit
would
be
made
to
appear
perfectly
ridiculous
unless
you
take
the
view,
which
i
understand
them
to
announce,
namely,
that
the
interior
decorating
business
and
the
custom
furniture
business
was
a
separate,
what's
the
word,
not
business?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
establishment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
still
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
just
a
minute
please,
may
i
ask
just
this
question.
i
--
do
you
stand
or
fall
in
this
case
on
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
said
--
[laughter]
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
said
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understand
you
to
answer
the
chief
justice
that
if
it's
--
if
this
is
two
establishments,
then
the
one
that
--
that
neither
could
qualify
for
the
exemption.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
what
about
the
one
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
let's
see
about
--
i
don't
know
which
one
that
you're
going
to
say
that
is,
but
the
one
dealing
with
interior
decorating
and
furniture
manufacturing.
do
you
say
that
could
not
apply
--
the
exemption
could
not
apply
to
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
i
understood
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
to
tell
the
chief
justice
it
could.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
which
one
is
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
worked
both
places
at
different
times.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
ms.
margolin,
all
candor,
do
you
still
tell
me
this
is
not
a
fuzzy
record?
