chief

am
i
--
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
the
case
is
this
simple
that
if
it
is
two
establishments,
then
there's
no
question
about
--
about
this
exemption
not
applying
because
it's
manufacturing?
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
is
one
establishment,
there's
no
question
about
it
applying
because
the
40%
of
the
total
volume
for
the
--
for
the
year
comes
from
the
manufacturing
of
this
product.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
that
doesn't
fit
the
percentages
of
the
exemption.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
made
this
--
who
made
this
part?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
