justice

is
that
proceeding
some
analogous
for
the
abandonment
of
a
railroad
instead
of
the
icc?
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
you
do
that,
would
you
mind?
you
said
something
a
few
moments
ago
about
the
contract
containing
a
provision
that
if
the
rate
should
be
changed
by
hearing
before
the
commission,
contract
should
cease
to
exist.
did
you
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
provision
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
the
practical
matter?
what
would
be
the
effect
of
that
if
the
commission
should
act
under
5
and
finally
have
here
--
at
the
hearing
reduce
the
rate
fixed
in
the
contract?
what
would
be
the
consequence
of
this
clause
to
the
contract
under
those
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
understand.
i'm
talking
about
giving
the
act
the
effect
which
your
adversaries
asserted
should
be
given.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
another
question
as
to
the
practical
effect?
suppose
the
--
this
contract
--
this
contract
instead
of
being
made
for
10
and
20
years
had
been
made
for
one
year
or
for
six
months,
what
remedy
could
the
commission
have
afforded
in
connection
with
rates
that
were
too
high,
it
deemed
too
high?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
during
that
six
months
or
a
year,
the
commission
had
pending
before
it
hearings
under
5
to
bring
about
a
reduction
of
rates
or
change
in
rates,
what
would
be
the
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
should
the
commission
have
power
to
stop
just
precisely
what
i
said?
if
it's
true,
they
have
a
right
to
make
contract
terminate
at
the
time
they
agreed
on.and
they
make
those
contract
and
they
decide
to
make
them
for
a
year
or
six
months
during
which
time
you
wouldn't
have
great
opportunity
to
pass
on
the
rates
under
5
(a).
what
--
what
power
would
the
commission
have
to
--
if
his
position
is
correct
that
they
have
a
right
to
make
this
contract,
what
power
the
commission
has
to
stop
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
is
the
increase
provided
in
this
contract?
from
what
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
is
the
main
difference,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
they
claim
that
all
initial
rates
can
have
--
that
they
have
a
right
to
make
all
initial
rates
by
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
say
that
when
they
submit
that
contract,
all
you
could
do,
if
you
did
anything,
was
to
initiate
some
kind
of
movement
later
which
puts
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
burden
on
the
commission
to
have
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
if
within
five
months,
it
reduces
their
acts,
then
you
have
some
action
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
if
you
do
not
act
within
five
months,
what
takes
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
30
days.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
proceeding
is
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
does
that
take
ordinarily?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
case
like
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
has
that
been?
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
how
long?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what's
happened
to
their
contract,
whatever
the
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
whole
basis
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it
can
refuse
the
certificate
if
it
found
that
the
rate
was
too
high?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it
could
refuse
the
certificate
if
it
found
the
rate
was
too
high
or
too
low?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
wouldn't
have
the
right
to
--
to
contract.
it
wouldn't
be
as
broad
as
i
had
understood
it,
i
thought
to
be.
i
thought
the
initial
right
had
the
right
--
they
had
the
right
to
fix
the
rate
and
keep
it
until
it
retains
under
5
(a).
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it?
where
is
(inaudible)
where
they
authorized
to
issue
--
have
such
a
condition?
you
mean
they
could
just
tell
them,
“you
can't
have
any
gases.
we
won't
let
them
--
let
you
serve
any
gas
up
there?”
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
am
talking
now
about
both.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
had
not
understood
until
now.
it
was
claimed
by
those
who
claimed
that
the
contract
that
the
later
rate
was
initially
fixed
(inaudible)
that
there
was
relief
(inaudible)
except
under
5
(a).
justice
hugo
l.
black
61.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
fixed
the
term
of
a
--
change
a
rate?
would
they
happen
to
have
to
continue
to
serve
under
your
argument?
