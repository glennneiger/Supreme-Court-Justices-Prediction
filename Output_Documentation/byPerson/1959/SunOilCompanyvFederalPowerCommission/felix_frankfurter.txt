justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
common
provision
in
state
utility
regulation
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
--
your
general
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
general
preposition
doesn't
without
more
beside
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wahrenbrock,
i
ought
to
know,
but
i
don't
recall.
has
your
commission
filed
a
fixed
minima
as
well
maxima?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
point
of
my
question
is,
your
position
wouldn't
be
any
different
if
the
new
arrangement
for
a
lower
rate
rather
than
a
higher
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
necessarily
--
a
necessary
logical
consequence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
--
--
that
means
that
so
long
as
it
is
in
business,
it
allowed
to
be
in
business,
it
can
never
make
a
new
contract,
that
all
--
all
aspects
of
new
arrangements
for
service
are
continuations
of
the
old
and
changes
merely
in
its
terms
although
the
original
arrangement
was
a
term
arrangement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
it
must
be
of
a
change
rate
and
a
change
of
an
existing
arrangement
rather
than
de
novo
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
initiated
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
all
arrangements
of
natural
gas
producers,
continuous
arrangements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
merely,
the
change
rate
for
the
--
the
scheme
of
--
of
getting
permission
to
change
the
rate
is
applicable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
terminal
date
must
be
fixed
by
the
commission
in
your
view
and
not
by
the
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
case,
its
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wahrenbrock,
my
difficulty
in
your
position
is
that
you
think
the
disability
--
inability
to
abandon
service
is
the
sole
question
here
rather
than
the
way
that
you
need
to
serve
rather
than
the
procedure
by
which
or
through
which
the
duty
to
serve
must
continue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
rather
--
isn't
that
the
crucial
problem
in
this
case?
supposed
one
--
suppose
i
agree
entirely
with
you
on
the
abandonment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
doesn't
help
me
to
get
over
one
or
the
other
side,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
significance
of
the
terminal
period
in
the
contract?
what
is
--
what
legal
point
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
once
the
--
once
the
commission
sanctions
a
rate
for
a
term
contract,
the
commission
is
bound
by
two,
is
it
--
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean,
during
that
period,
the
rate
can't
be
changed,
could
it,
if
there's
an
agreement
between
the
parties
and
the
--
and
the
commission
has
sanctioned
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
sua
sponte?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
this
contract,
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this.
when
a
contract
like
this
is
filed
as
a
basis
of
a
10-year
certificate,
has
the
commission
--
would
--
would
the
commission
have
power
to
say,
“no,
we
won't
grant
a
certificate
on
a
term
contract
and
no
matter
what
the
term
is
you
can't
abandon
your
service.
no
matter
what
changes
you
make
in
a
contract,
in
a
document
at
the
end
of
a
terminal
period,
it's
a
continuing
--
it
continues
the
old
contract.
we
grant
you
a
certificate
only
on
the
condition
that
the
contract
in
term
is
for
an
indefinite
period.”
would
you
have
that
power?
subject
of
course
to
applications
for
increases
or
decreases
in
rate,
increase
in
rate.
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
merely
what
you
said,
the
contact
amounts
to,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
he
--
at
the
end
of
the
period,
i
don't
see
what
difference
--
real
difference
it
makes.
he
--
he
has
to
get
the
permission
where
they
could
unilaterally
file
or
not,
he
has
to
get
the
permission
of
the
commission
to
make
any
changes,
doesn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
the
consumer
or
to
public
interest,
which
is
you're
--
which
you
are
the
trustee?
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
it
was
just
raised
to
9,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
--
are
reduced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
a
new
--
if
it's
a
new
company,
for
instance,
it'd
be
a
new
sale,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
i'm
--
i'm
--
could
i
eliminate
all
that,
a
brand
new
non-corporate
successor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
--
very
well.
let
me
ask
you
this.
assume
this
is
a
new
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
assume
i
agree
with
you
about
abandonment
power,
what
control
has
the
commission,
assume
you
were
wrong,
you're
wrong
in
you
contention,
what
control
does
the
commission
have
over
this
--
over
this
as
a
newly
conceived
contract?
just
assume
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
rates
are
too
high,
you
could
refuse
a
certificate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
yes.
i
mean
--
so
that
--
that
this
--
a
--
a
conceived
new
contract
would
have
to
run
the
(inaudible)
of
your
approval
of
the
public
interest,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
could
take
that
into
account
in
--
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
the
new
service
is
partly
dependent
on
this
water
over
the
dam
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
wouldn't
it
be?
wouldn't
that
be
taken
into
account?
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
as
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
practical
matter
would
be
the
difference
what
--
what
lessen
control
or
power
you
have
in
protecting
the
public
interest
if
this
were
conceived
to
be
a
new
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
of
course,
this
question
would
never
have
risen
if
the
rate
had
been
the
same,
would
it?
i
mean,
wouldn't
it
be
an
urge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
aren't
these
--
aren't
these
considerations
have
to
canvas
the
last
two
or
three
minutes
at
the
heart
of
this
whole
(inaudible)
confident,
these
--
the
actual
practical
results
depending
on
whether
they
go
under
5
(a)
with
all
the
power
that
you
have
or
haven't
got
or
if
this
is
a
continuing
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
does
that
--
that
seems
to
me
to
make
it
not
irrelevant
unless
you
tell
me
it's
irrelevant
to
ask
whether
this
long
period
in
determining
5
(a)
proceedings
is
inherent
in
the
statute
or
is
it
due
to
some
other
consideration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
inherent
in
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
the
suggestion
that
after
all
the
bite
of
--
of
a
regulatory
system
is
its
effective
administration
and
if
it
takes
five
minutes
to
exert
power
that
may,
in
the
end,
reach
the
same
result,
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
being
able
to
have
a
control
that
you
can
exercise
pdq.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understand
the
--
your
suggestion
that
if,
under
the
gas
act,
you
have
a
right
to
have
this
treated
as
a
new
contract
with
all
of
the
machinery
or
the
--
the
procedure
of
5
(a),
you
have
a
right
to
stand
on
that.
and
if
the
reasons
that
have
just
been
told
to
us,
they're
not
inherent
in
the
statute,
that
--
that's
none
of
your
concern.
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
may
or
may
not
or
does
not
the
difference
in
the
operation
of
different
sections
of
the
act
bare
on
how
the
different
sections
of
the
act
should
be
construed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
more
than
possible.
isn't
it
pertinent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
certificate
is
conditioned
on
satisfying
the
public
interest,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
given
what
--
what
is
relevant
to
determining
the
public
interest,
pretty
broad
power,
exactly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
should
think
--
i
should
think
either
a
bloated
--
what
the
commission
--
they
use
a
bloated
rate,
excessive
rate
or
too
long
a
duration
for
the
changes
of
the
reasonably
expected
changes
in
this
domain.
i
should
think
even
that.
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
if
a
well-grounded
opinion
by
the
commission's
examination,
the
term
is
too
long
not
to
allow
all
the
other
conditions
the
other
powers
to
come
into
play
for
the
new
contract
from
your
point
of
view
would
hardly
be
outside
of
“public
interest”.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
a
--
a
contract
that
the
commission
deemed
too
long
a
duration,
even
assuming
that
an
arrangement
like
this
would
be
deemed
a
new
conflict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
were
right
starting
from
your
--
i
should
think
if
you
had
a
new
contract
imposing
a
30-year
term
and
the
commission
made
out
a
case
thereon
(inaudible)
about
these
things
that
that
is
--
that
puts
also
some
difficulties
of
regulatory
process.
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
such
a
termination
would
be
deemed
in
excess
of
its
power
to
ascertain
what
property
may
be
considered
power
of
the
public
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
broad,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
time.
mr.
jefferson
thought
all
constitutions
automatically
to
be
renewed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
least
once
in
18
years.
