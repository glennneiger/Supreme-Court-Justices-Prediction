mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
preface
my
argument
in
this
as
well
as
in
the
next
case
with
a
very
short
statement
of
what
i
believe
to
be
our
basic
position
applicable
to
both
cases,
namely
that
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
leave
a
company
which
is
engaged
in
supplying
natural
gas
for
ultimate
distribution
to
the
public,
free
to
fix
its
own
time
when
it
will
quit
that
sale,
either
unilaterally
or
by
contract.
because
congress
by
regulating
the
abandonment
of
service
has
incorporated
in
the
natural
gas
act
the
basic
public
utility
concept
of
dedication
to
public
service.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
if
sun
wanted
to
stop
its
service,
it
would
have
to
comply
with
section
7
(b).
and
to
comply
with
section
7
(b),
it
would
have
to
get
the
commission's
permission
or
approval,
which
the
commission
could
only
give
if
it
found
that
the
available
supply
of
gas
was
depleted,
to
use
a
short
phrase,
or
if
it
found
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
would
permit
such
abandonment.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
until
it
gets
the
permission
and
approval
of
the
commission
under
section
7(b).
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
language
which
was
originally
suggested
for
that
section
7
(b)
was
modeled
on
section
118
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
this
language
is,
so
far
as
it
is
here
pertinent,
substantially
the
same.
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
that's
the
reason
i
refer
to
it
as
the
usual
public
utility
concept
of
dedication
to
public
service.
present
case
involves
an
attempt
to
a
claim
that
the
expiration
of
a
contract
constitutes
an
exemption
to
that.
(inaudible)
case
involves
the
sellers
in
systems
on
a
certificate
for
a
new
sale
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
with
the
right
to
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no,
sir.
the
order
here
under
review
dealt,
as
my
opponent
has
suggested,
with
two
filings
tendered
by
sun.
the
first,
a
filing
of
a
20-cent
per
mcf
rate
for
gas
in
lieu
of
a
previous
7.33-cent
rate
in
order
to
express
them
both
on
the
same
pressure
base,
7.36
cents
per
mcf
in
lieu
of
a
7.33-cent
rate
for
gas
from
the
same
production
field
sold
by
the
same
seller
from
the
same
production
properties
to
the
same
seller
through
the
same
facilities
in
substantially
the
same
amounts,
the
formula
was
different,
the
amounts
have
continued
and
substantially
the
same
to
the
same
buyer
and
for
the
same
purpose.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
not
in
expressed
terms.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
is
directed
to
--
if
it
finds
that
a
rate
is
unjust
or
unreasonable
or
unduly
discriminatory
or
preferential
to
fix
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that
is
right.
but
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
these
physical
transactions,
these
substantial
transactions,
these
ultimate
transactions
are
so
similar,
sun,
nevertheless,
attempted
to
file
the
new
rate
as
a
new
one
and
not
as
a
change.
and
to
be
consistent,
it
applied
for
a
new
certificate.
now,
the
significance
of
this
attempt
is
obvious
if
it
could
get
both
a
new
certificate
and
a
new
rate
yet
and
treated
as
that,
it
would
mean
that
it
was
free
to
contract
to
quit
a
service
at
any
time.
it
would
not
be
obliged
to
continue
its
service
subject
to
getting
approval
under
section
7
(b).
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
think
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
it,
if
your
honor
please,
from
contracting
for
a
service
to
succeed
the
previous
service,
a
rate
to
succeed
the
previous
rate,
filing
the
change
or
the
same
rate
or
service
with
the
commission.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir,
unless
it
has
gotten
permission
of
the
commission
to
abandon,
to
terminate
the
previous
sale.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
and
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
now,
i
draw
this
distinction.
there
had
been
some
instances
when
a
company
had
a
temporary
supply
of
gas
available
or
somebody
had
a
temporary
need,
they've
asked
for
limited
term
certificates
and
the
commission
finding
that
there
were
special
circumstances.
there
have
been
about
four
such
we
sight
in
our
brief.
finding
the
special
circumstances
there
issued
certificates
with
conditions
to
them
expressly
fixing
a
date
of
termination
upon
which
the
obligation
to
continue
service
would
expire.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that
is
right.
now,
if
sun
could
contract
to
terminate
at
the
end
of
10
years
as
here,
it
could
do
so
for
five
or
one
or
as
here,
with
the
contract
provision
in
it
and
this
contract
had
a
provision
in
it
that
if
the
federal
power
commission
should
undertake
to
fix
its
rates
to
reduce
the
rate
fixed
in
the
contract,
sun
had
the
option
on
30
days
notice
to
terminate
the
entire
contract,
then
the
power,
that's
on
sought
here,
would
enable
it
at
anytime
on
30
days
notice
to
avoid
any
rate
that
the
commission
fixed
that
was
less
than
the
contract
rate.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
has
suggested
that
there
might
be
a
difference
between
the
duration
of
the
certificate
and
the
duration
of
the
rate
schedule
of
filing.
if
sun
could
only
get
a
new
rate
schedule
and
the
old
certificate
were
to
continue,
then
it
would
avoid
commission
regulation
of
the
7.33
to
20-cent
increase
under
section
4
(d)
of
the
act
as
a
change
and
the
result
would
be
that
the
commission
could
not
suspend
the
20-cent
increase
for
five
months.
it
could
not
impose
the
refunding
obligation
upon
the
expiration
of
the
five
months.
and
at
the
hearing,
the
burden
of
proof
would
not
be
upon
sun
to
justify
the
new
rate.
instead,
it
would
--
the
commission
would
have
to
proceed
as
mr.
hoffman
has
suggested
under
section
5
(a)
under
which
the
burden
is
on
the
commission.
the
commission
would
first
have
to
go
out
and
make
its
field
study
in
order
to
be
prepared
to
go
forward
and
the
rate
would
become
effective
only
prospectively
from
the
end
of
the
rate
proceeding
before
the
commission.
now,
the
--
the
order
under
review,
as
mr.
hoffman
said,
rejected
both
of
these
filings
as
duplications,
the
20-cent
rate
as
a
duplication
of
the
7.33-cent
rate
because
there
had
been
no
notice
of
termination
of
the
7.33-cent
rate
and
the
certificate
application
because
there
had
been
no
application
and
no
granting
of
an
application
for
permission
to
abandon
the
service.
but
in
--
it
acted
without
prejudice
to
the
right
of
sun
to
file
for
a
rate
change
and
that's
what
it
did.
that
rate
change
was
suspended
for
five
months.
it
then
went
into
effect
under
a
refunding
obligation.
the
hearing
--
the
proceeding
on
that
rate
increase
was
consolidated
with
a
5
(a)
proceeding,
which
the
commission
had
initiated
against
sun.
the
two
began
hearings
last
fall
and
the
hearing
is
right
now
under
recess
and
will
resume
in
may.
i'd
like
to
take
up
then
first
the
rate
aspects
of
the
commission's
order
and
point
out
that
the
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
commission's
regulations
clearly
warranted
the
commission's
rejection
as
duplication
for
non-termination
of
the
preceding
filing.
section
4
(d)
of
the
act,
which
appears
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix
at
page
52,
provides
that
no
change
shall
be
made
in
any
rate
which
is
subject
to
regulation
by
the
commission
without
30
days
notice
given
by
filing
a
new
rate
schedule
with
the
commission
and
public
notice
of
that
new
rate.
this
section
would
require
notice
to
be
filed
in
that
manner
of
a
termination
of
a
sale
because
it
has
long
been
established
that
a
termination
is
a
--
a
change
in
service.
that
question
first
arouse
before
the
federal
power
commission
following
this
court's
affirmance
of
the
commission's
assertion
of
jurisdiction
under
the
federal
power
act,
under
corresponding
provisions
of
the
federal
power
act
of
jurisdiction
over
the
jersey
central
power
&
light
company.
following
that
affirmance
of
commission
jurisdiction
over
that
company,
jersey
central
tried
to
get
out
from
under
the
commission's
regulation
by
terminating
that
service.
and
the
commission
refused
to
do
--
refused
to
allow
that
termination
to
go
into
effect
unless
it
would
file
notice
of
that
termination
under
the
rate
filing
provisions
of
the
power
act
which
correspond
to
those
of
the
gas
act.
and
that
early
interpretation
of
the
change
requirement
as
applying
to
the
termination
of
sale
was
thereafter
embodied
in
the
commission's
formal
regulations
and
appears
in
sections
2.4
for
the
power
act
and
2.5
for
the
gas
act,
which
we
have
cited
and
which
appear
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
beyond
that,
this
court
referred
to
that
interpretation
and
in
effect,
we
think
approved
it
in
the
pennsylvania
water
&
power
company
case
where
after
the
commission
had
reduced
penn
water's
rates
and
penn
water
was
filing
its
application
for
rehearing,
it
represented
to
the
commission
in
its
application
for
rehearing
that
it
was
terminating
the
contract
in
order
to
get
out
from
under
the
sale,
the
price
of
which
the
commission
had
reduced.
and
it
said,
“because
of
that
termination
of
the
sale,
your
order
has
now
lost
its
basis.”
the
commission
in
its
denial
of
rehearing
in
that
case
said,
"you
have
not
complied
with
the
requirement
of
the
filing
provisions
that
you
file
notice
of
that
termination
as
a
sale
and
not
having
complied
with
it,
you
have
--
your
action
is
illegal
and
provides
no
basis
for
rehearing."
when
that
matter
came
before
this
court,
the
court
considered
it.
and
at
that
time,
a
further
element
had
entered
into
it.
in
a
private
litigation,
the
contract
under
which
that
service
had
been
rendered,
had
been
held
illegal
under
the
sherman
antitrust
law
and
penn
water
argued
that
that
provided
a
further
basis
for
avoiding
the
rate
which
the
commission
had
reduced.
mr.
justice
black
writing
for
the
court
in
that
case
referred
to
these
arguments
and
said,
“if
penn
water
wants
to
discontinue
some
or
all
of
its
services
it
has
rendered
for
the
past
20
years,
the
act,”
as
the
commission
pointed
out,
namely,
as
it
had
pointed
out
in
its
order
on
the
application
for
rehearing,
“opens
up
a
way,
section
205
(d),”
and
that
is
the
section
which
corresponds
to
4
(d)
here,
“provides
that
no
change
shall
be
made
by
any
public
utility
in
any
such
service
or
contract
relating
thereto
except
after
30
days
notice
to
the
commission
and
the
public.”
mr.
justice
black
went
on,
"here,
instead
of
following
the
procedure
for
changing
existing
services
and
practices,
a
procedure
which
the
congress
has
authorized
and
which
the
commission
has
supplemented
by
rules
of
its
own,
the
company
has
tried
rather
to
utilize
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
so
as
to
nullify
a
rate
reduction
order.”
now,
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
phillips
case,
holding
that
the
gas
act
applied
to
independent
producers,
the
commission
in
the
new
regulations,
which
it
issued
applicable
to
independent
producers,
embodied
in
those
regulations
a
section
which
explicitly
dealt
with
this
subject
which
sun
has
not
complied
with.
that
section
is
entitled
"cancelation
or
termination"
and
it
reads,
"when
a
rate
schedule
or
part
thereof
is
to
be
cancelled
or
is
to
terminate
by
its
own
terms
and
no
new
schedule
or
part
thereof
is
to
filed
in
its
place,
the
filing
company
shall
notice
the
commission
of
the
proposed
cancellation
or
termination
at
least
30
days
prior
to
the
proposed
effective
date
of
such
cancellation
or
termination.”
now,
that
provision
for
a
special
re-filing
,where
a
filed
contract
is
to
terminate
in
the
future
by
its
own
terms,
is
parallel
by
similar
requirements
requiring
special
re-filing
were
a
filed
contract
rate
is
to
increase
in
--
the
rate
is
to
increase
in
the
future
by
its
own
terms.
other
regulations
of
the
commission
are
explicitly
in
reference
to
that
and
such
requirements
have
been
consistently
enforced
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
we
cite
in
our
briefs
seven
cases
spanning
19
years
under
the
gas
act,
decided
in
four
circuits
in
which
this
court
has
denied
certiorari
five
times.
culminating,
i
may
say,
in
the
decision
last
fall
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
episcopal
theological
seminary
case
and
because
our
brief
deals
inadequately,
i
--
i
feel,
with
that
case,
i
wish
to
take
time
to
call
the
court's
attention
specifically
to
this
very
relevant
language
by
mr.
justice
reed,
sitting
by
special
designation
on
a
panel
which
included
chief
judge
prettyman
and
--
and
circuit
judge
fahy.
section
4
(d)
requires
that
the
public
must
be
kept
informed.
mr.
justice
reed
went
on
to
quote
from
that
section
"informed
'of
these
changes
to
be
made'
in
the
schedule
or
schedules
then
enforce
and
the
time
when
the
change
or
changes
will
go
into
effect".
no
change
may
be
made
in
any
rate
or
in
quoting
from
the
statute,
"schedule
then
enforce
without
notice
to
the
commission
and
the
public".
this
language
is
persuasive
that
forehanded
contractual
provisions
cannot
modify
the
regulatory
provisions
of
the
act
as
urged
by
petitioners.
the
purpose
is
to
advice
the
public
of
a
change
in
the
current
rate.
petitioner's
interpretation
would
run
counter
to
the
language
and
purpose
of
congress
to
maintain
the
lowest
reasonable
rates.
to
approve
escalation
clauses
in
long-term
contracts
when
the
contracts
were
originally
filed
would
determine
rates
for
indefinite
future
periods.
fair
adjustments
of
escalation
clause
ratio
the
future
costs
and
earnings
would
be
impossible
at
that
time.
public
utility
rates
cannot
be
fixed
solely
by
bargaining
between
producers
and
distributors.
the
governmental
agency
also
has
the
duty
to
protect
the
consumers.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
sun
bases
its
entire
claim
on
the
fact
that
it
has
contracted
for
a
10-year
period
--
period.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
yes,
he
did
so.
but
i
was
answering
on
the
assumption
that
you
were
inquiring
with
respect
to
the
duration
of
the
--
of
the
obligation
to
continue
to
sell.
and
as
i
understand
petitioner's
contention,
it
is
that
that
obligation
expires
because
the
contract
expires
without
filing
a
new
rate
schedule.
and
this
provision
that
i
am
speaking
of
requires
that
they
file
a
new
rate
schedule
even
when
the
contract
itself
provides
for
its
own
expiration
at
the
end
of
the
10-year
term.
now,
the
same
considerations
or
similar
parallel
considerations
to
those
that
were
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
reed
would
apply
if
the
commission
were
tried
to
decide
10,
15,
20
or
more
years
in
advance,
whether
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
would
permit
future
termination.
he
was
talking
about
future
price
adjustments.
here,
we
have
future
termination
if
that
were
to
be
attempted
to
be
resolved
by
the
commission
when
it
accepted
the
original
rate
filing
or
when
it
failed
to
suspend
the
original
rate
filing.
and
because
of
the
close
relationship
of
service
to
the
question
of
rates,
rates
are
after
all
price
for
a
service,
a
specified
service,
and
if
you
can
change
or
terminate
service,
you
--
you've
lost
your
power
over
the
rates.
and
penn
water
case,
to
which
i
previously
referred,
which
it
--
correlated
the
regulation
of
the
termination
of
service
to
a
--
a
change
in
rate
would
be
equally
applicable
here.
now,
ignoring
all
of
these
considerations
with
respect
to
the
failure
to
terminate
its
rate
filing,
sun
contends
that
this
is
not
a
change
for
there
are,
it
says
here,
two
separate
independent
sales,
each
of
a
specific
volume
or
batch
of
gas,
to
use
its
phrase.
we
think
that
sun's
preoccupation
with
the
legal
mechanisms,
the
contracts
loses
sight
of
the
objectives
of
the
gas
act.
congress
was
not
concerned
to
remedy
contracting
practices.congress
was
concerned
with
the
public
interest
in
the
supply
of
gas
and
the
rates
to
be
charged,
therefore,
gas
that
was
to
supply
the
needs
of
the
utilities
that
were
locally
distributing
that
gas
to
ultimate
consumers.
its
concern,
as
manifested
in
section
1
(a)
of
the
act,
was
not
whether
a
succession
of
deliveries
under
one
contract
is
involved
or
a
succession
of
contracts.
it
said
in
section
1
(a),
“the
business
of
transporting
and
selling
natural
gas
for
ultimate
distribution
to
the
public
is
affected
with
a
public
interest.”
and
in
implementing
that
general
policy,
perhaps
no
--
no
provision
of
the
act
is
more
important
to
these
cases
than
to
--
than
section
7
(b),
where
it
explicitly
impose
the
obligation
to
continue
service
indefinitely.
let
me
call
your
attention
to
the
language
of
7
(b).
it
appears
in
the
appendix
to
out
brief,
pages
54
and
55.
“no
natural
gas
company
shall
abandon
all
or
any
portion
of
its
facilities
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
or
any
service
rendered
by
means
of
such
facilities
without
the
permission
and
approval
of
the
commission
first
had
obtained
after
due
hearing
and
the
finding
by
the
commission
that
the
available
supply
of
natural
gas
is
depleted
to
the
extent
that
the
continuance
of
service
is
unwarranted
or
that
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
and
necessity
permit
such
abandonment.”
in
the
legislative
history,
brief
and
very
little
of
it,
though
there
is,
is
indicative
that
the
purpose
of
that
provision
was
to
prevent
evasion
of
rates
which
had
been
prescribed
by
the
commission
or
to
prevent
a
company
which
was
subject
to
commission
rate
regulation
by
the
threat
of
abandoning
its
service
from
being
able
to
coerce
regulation.
this
appears
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
john
e.
benton,
who
was
then
the
solicitor
of
the
national
association
of
railroad
and
utility
commissioners
--
commissioners
--
commissions,
in
testifying,
and
we
cite
this
testimony
of
his
in
our
brief.
he
said,
“there
should
not
be
any
possibility
of
a
company
having
the
chance
to
claim
and
to
litigate
the
claim,
that
if
it
does
not
like
a
rate
which
has
been
fixed
by
the
federal
tribunal,
it
can
discontinue
service.”
if
a
company
has
established
service
to
a
distributing
company
on
which
the
public
is
dependant
and
a
rate
is
fixed
by
the
federal
tribunal
for
that
service,
which
the
company
does
not
like,
the
company
should
not
be
in
a
position
to
say,
“we
are
permitted
to
abandon
our
service
and
we
will
abandon
it.”
now,
i
want
to
call
your
attention,
if
you
please,
to
the
fact
that
four
times
in
that
short
quotation,
mr.
benton,
who
probably
knew
as
much
about
the
problem
at
that
stage
as
anyone
else.
mr.
benton
said
--
called
it
“service”,
and
he
was
talking
about
service
to
a
succeeding
buyer
in
the
course
of
the
chain
by
which
the
public
ultimately
would
be
served.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
our
commission
felt
for
many
years
that
this
act
did
not
apply
to
produce
--
this
court
has
settled
that
question.
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
he
is
talking
about
--
specifically,
his
language
is
--
has
established
service
to
a
distributing
company.
now,
that
is
not
necessarily
conclusive
because
i
found
the
usage
more
than
once.
the
fact
is
that
it
was
used
by
this
court
recently,
i
think,
regarding
pipeline
companies
also
has
distributors
of
gas
in
a
--
in
a
broader
sense.
that
--
that's
not
necessarily
controlling
on
that,
i
think,
although
it
might
have
been.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
if
you
regard
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
if
you
regard
the
lines
that
radiate
out
from
the
southwest,
from
louisiana,
southern
mississippi
as
distributing
the
gas
from
those
sections
of
the
country
in
that
sense
but
not
in
the
usual
sense.
the
usual
sense
is,
however,
to
prefix
local
ahead
of
the
word
“distributor”
and
that
is
the
more
usual
usage.
now,
i
might
point
out
that
unless
this
7
(b)
were
to
apply
upon
the
cessation
of
a
contract,
there
wouldn't
be
much
need
for
it.
it
--
it's
really
not
as
necessary
during
the
terms
of
the
contracts
because
during
the
terms
of
the
contract,
unless
the
seller
can
get
the
buyer's
agreement
to
modify
the
contract
and
terminate
it,
he
cannot,
under
mobile,
the
seller
cannot
file
a
termination.
so
it
is
only
a
termination
at
the
expiration
of
a
contract
that
really
invited
this
problem
or
a
termination
to
which
the
buyer
has
agreed
--
agreed.
and
i
might
point
out
in
this
connection
that
under
the
corresponding
provision
of
section
1.--
118
parenthesis
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
this
very
question
with
which
we
are
here
dealing,
came
before
this
court.
in
thompson
against
the
texas
mexican
railway,
and
we
think
that
the
decision
there
lends
further
rate
weight
to
the
commission's
position
and
the
position
of
the
court
below
here
that
the
termination
of
a
contract
does
not
warrant
the
abandonment
of
service
without
the
commission's
approval.
there,
one
railroad
had
entered
into
50-year
contract
to
lease
its
tracks
to
another
railroad
and
the
other
railroad
was
going
to
operate
its
trains
for
that
50-year
period
over
its
tracks.
the
notice
--
the
contract
was
terminable
on
12
months
notice
and
the
lessor
gave
the
12
months
notice.
when
the
operating
company
refused
to
stop
operating
its
trains
over
the
tracks
and
continued,
the
lessor
sued
to
enjoin
continued
operation
and
sought
to
recover
damages
for
each
day's
continuance
of
the
use
in
--
after
the
contract
had
been
terminated.
the
district
court
denied
injunction
but
allowed
recovery
of
damages.
the
question
of
the
damages
came
before
this
court
and
this
court
held
--
reversed
the
district
court
and
held
that
it
should
have
stayed
its
hands
until
the
interstate
commerce
commission
could
pass
upon
abandonment
under
section
118
of
the
commerce
act
and
indicated
that
if
the
lessee
didn't
apply
for
abandonment,
the
lessor
could
invoke
the
abandonment
provision
equally
itself.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that
is
cited
in
our
brief.
it's
328
u.s.
134,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
--
i
haven't
come
to
that
yet.
i
think
that
this
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that
is
right.
and
we
--
i
have
still
to
come
to
those.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
if
this
is
the
policy
of
section
7
(b),
i
wish
now
deterrent
to
sun's
contention
that
it's
1947
contract
constituted,
as
it
says,
“a
single
sale
of
a
specific
volume
of
gas
for
a
specific
term.”
our
position
is
that
if
you
look
to
the
terms
of
the
contract
itself,
that
it
is
not
one
sale,
that
it
is
not
a
particular
--
that
no
particular
volume
of
gas
is
specified
and
that
the
term,
the
duration
is
contingent.
it
was
rather,
and
the
contract
begins,
i
believe,
on
--
near
record
33,
it
was
rather
to
furnish
a
continuos
flow
around
the
clock
as
the
wells
flowed
around
the
calendar
“of
all
merchantable
gas
that
may
be
produced
form
all
wells,”
and
that's
quoted
from
the
contract.
and
it
was
to
produce
such
amounts
as
the
pipeline.
the
buyer
might
take
within
specified
minima
--
minimum
and
maximum.
and
let's
consider
the
minimum.
sun
owned
part
of
the
production
properties
in
the
gwinfield
--
gwinville
field.
the
pipeline
was
proposing
to
take
20%
of
its
pipeline
requirements
from
the
gwinville
field
and
it
had
a
formula
for
taking
a
ratable
part
of
that
field
from
sun.
but
--
so
the
criterion
becomes
the
pipelines
requirements
and
those
requirements
are
spelled
out,
all
that
the
pipeline
would
sell,
all
that
it
would
to
operate,
all
that
--
its
line,
its
own
consumption
and
all
that
it
would
lose
in
the
operation
of
its
line.
that
was
its
pipeline
requirements.
but
it
was
not
only
the
original
line
as
it
was
then
in
existence,
but
it
was
the
line
as
it
should
be
expanded
or
enlarged
in
the
--
in
the
states
in
which
it
then
existed,
some
five
southeastern
states
or,
and
explicitly
in
the
statute,
in
any
other
states.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
during
the
10-year
term
of
the
contract
from
1947
to
1957,
the
pipeline
requirements
increased
400%,
so
that
the
initial
20%
of
the
pipeline
requirements
represented
four
times
as
much
at
the
end
of
the
contract
than
it
did
at
the
beginning.
something
that
wasn't
known
but
was
provided
for
at
the
time
the
contract
was
entered
into.
and
on
the
contract
itself
provided
that
the
pipeline
could
change
the
20%
--
20%
minimum
from
20%
to
30%.
and
then
it
provided
that
that
was
only
the
minimum,
the
maximum
was
that
the
pipeline
could
take
150%
of
the
minimum,
any
day,
everyday
if
it
wanted
to.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
what
becomes
of
the
petitioner's
suggestion
or
claim
that
there
was
a
specific
volume,
a
batch
of
gas
that
was
sold.
contract
also
provided
that
if
the
seller
wasn't
able
to
produce
that
much
gas,
if
its
wells
and
properties
wouldn't
produce
that
much
gas
that
then
the
minimum
should
be
fixed
at
66
and
2/3%
of
what
the
wells
would
deliver.
and
that
is
the
provision,
66
and
2/3%
that
constitutes
basically
the
formula
of
the
new
contract,
the
1957
contract.
the
contract
provided
that
payment
was
to
be
made
for
this
flowing
amount
of
gas
on
the
28th
day
of
each
month
for
the
amount
of
gas
metered
during
the
preceding
calendar
month.
it
provided
that
a
certain
minimum
--
the
minimum
amount
should
be
taken
or
paid
for
at
the
end
of
each
year.
now,
why
isn't
that
then
10
sales,
10
years,
10
minimum
that
fixes
at
the
end
of
each
year?
the
price
obligation
is
firmly
fixed.
perhaps,
it's
10
sales
or
perhaps
it's
one
sale
every
month,
10
times
--
10
times
12,
120
or
maybe
it's
a
sale
everyday
because
it's
expressed
in
terms
of
daily
maximum
and
minimum.
maybe
it's
the
sale
everyday.
the
--
the
fact
is
that
it
was
a
continuing
sale
and
you
can
use
whatever
legal
rubric
--
rubric
you
want
to,
but
you
certainly
can't
call
it
a
sale
of
gas,
one
sale
completed
when
made.
the
--
the
seller
is
given
the
option
by
the
expressed
terms
of
the
contract
on
30
days
notice
to
terminate
the
contract
if
the
fpc
undertakes
to
reduce
the
--
the
prices
--
the
rate
below
the
contract
price.
in
that
case,
what
is
the
specific
term
of
the
contract?
what
was
the
batch
of
gas
sold?other
provisions,
the
contract
show
that
it
was
not
itself
a
sale
as
sun
now
claims
when
it
says
in
it's
brief
“a
--
a
contract
of
sale,”
when
it
says
that
this
constituted
--
constituted
a
sale
because
the
contract
expressly
sell
--
says
that
the
agreement
is
to
sell
and
deliver,
to
purchase
and
receive.
and
it
goes
on
to
say
“all
gas
sold
and
purchased
hereunder
shall
be
delivered
by
the
seller
to
the
buyer
at
the
outlet
of
each
separator.”
seller
shall
be
in
control
and
in
possession
of
such
gas
and
liable
and
responsible
therefore
up
to
such
point
of
delivery
and
buyer
shall
assume
all
liability
and
responsibility
therefore
from
and
after
such
point
of
delivery.
it
contains
another
provision
in
which
it
expressly,
it
seems
to
us,
disclaims
that
a
batch
of
gas
is
being
sold
all
at
once
before
delivery
because
it
says
“seller
is
not”
in
the
language
that
mr.
hoffman
read
to
you.
seller
is
not
dedicating
to
buyer
any
portion
of
seller's
gas
reserves.
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
think
it
is
--
it
is
the
continuing
flow
of
gas
which
is
necessary
to
meet
the
nature
of
the
public
utility
law.
i
think
that's
what
congress
intended
to
be
met.
the
public
does
not
have
storage
facilities
in
its
houses
and
commercial
and
industrial
establishment
for
gas.
it
turns
the
gas
on
and
use
it
as
it
comes.
it's
not
quite
like
electricity
which
has
to
be
generated
at
the
instant
with
the
speed
of
light
at
which
it
is
used.
there
is
line
pack.
you
can
draw
on
storage
in
the
line
to
a
limited
extent.
but
it
is
a
flow,
a
continuing
flow.
it's
no
more
“segreble”
into
batches
than
the
flow
of
a
river.
now,
that
so,
paid
for
on
a
monthly
basis
with
a
final
settlement
on
a
yearly
basis
but
continuable
without
termination.
and
it
is
the
--
without
termination
that
is
fixed
by
the
statute.
all
the
commission
has
left
to
do
is
to
regulate
the
rates,
take
care
of
the
certificates
of
convenience
and
necessity
for
making
the
sale
and
for
terminating
them
in
accordance
with
7
(b).
the
contract
--
there
can
be
no
contract
right
to
terminate
what
this
act
attempts
to
regulate
as
a
continuing
flow.
this
--
it
seems
to
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
at
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
at
the
end
of
that
period,
mobile
would
never
--
the
--
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
against
mobile,
would
not
prohibit
the
seller
from
then
coming
in
unilaterally
with
any
rate
it
wanted
to
file.
i
think
that
is
probably
the
most
important
significance.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i'm
not
sure
what
the
significance
of
the
commission
being
bound
might
be.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
seller
cannot
unilaterally
file
in
violation
of
its
contract.
the
commission
can
fix
if
it
finds
that
the
rate
is
unlawful.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir,
under
5
(a),
yes.
and
we
think
this
is
confirmed
by
the
statutory
language
of
section
1
(b)
which
sell
--
states
what
the
act
shall
applied
to.
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
apply
to
the
transportation
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce
to
the
sale
in
interstate
commerce
of
natural
gas
for
resale
for
ultimate
public
consumption,
for
domestic,
commercial
and
industrial
or
any
other
use
and
to
natural
gas
companies
engaged
in
such
transportation
or
sale
with
some
qualifications
that
follow
that
i
think
are
not
pertinent
here.
i'd
like
now
to
refer
to
the
discussion
of
--
to
the
point
--
the
argument
that
is
made
based
on
mobile
that
the
language
in
mobile
indicates
that
the
contracts
must
be
given
such
integrity
here
as
to
require

7
(b)
to
be
read
as
accepting
contracted
terminations
from
the
scope
of
7
(b).
first,
let
us
understand
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
this
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
1947
contract
contains
provision
on
page
46
of
the
record,
about
--
at
the
bottom
of
that
page,
the
last
paragraph
beginning
on
the
page,
about
half
way
down
the
paragraph,
“and
should
the
federal
power
commission
or
any
other,
federal,
state
or
other
governmental
regulatory
body
undertake
to
reduce
the
price
which
seller
is
to
receive
under
this
agreement
or
directly
or
indirectly
to
take
any
action
would
bring
about
such
a
result,
then
in
such
an
event,
seller
at
its
option,
may
cancel
and
terminate
this
agreement
upon
30
days
written
notice
to
buyer
of
its
intention
so
to
do.”
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
none,
giving
7
(b)
the
effect
which,
we
think,
must
be
given
to
it.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
think
i'll
have
to
leave
them
to
say
whether
they
believe
that
the
--
the
exercise
of
this
termination
right
here
would
call
for
the
same
treatment
which
they
say
the
expiration
of
the
originally
fixed
term
of
the
contract
would
call
for.
in
our
opinion,
there
should
--
in
my
opinion,
there
should
be
no
difference,
although
that
has
not
been
passed
on
by
the
commission.
if
the
contract
terminates
at
the
end
of
10
years
or
if
it
terminates
under
this
clause,
we
think
that
the
same
contention
that
they
are
making
would
be
applicable.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
on
--
again,
on
the
petitioner's
theory,
if
--
if
7
(b)
wouldn't
prevent
their
abandonment,
they
would,
at
the
end
of
six
months
or
one
year,
whatever
contract
term
they
had
fixed,
they
would
be
free
to
abandon
and
if
they
didn't
like
the
new
--
if
the
new
rate
were
sufficiently
distasteful,
presumably,
they
would
exercise
the
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
this
is
what
i
--
this
--
the
effect
would
be
the
same.
this
is
what
i
was
trying
to
point
out,
the
serious
consequence.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
certificate
authorizes
services
for
an
indefinite
period.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
and
require
as
a
condition
or
offer
an
alternative.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
hadn't
considered
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
we
had
--
the
commission
has
not
faced
applications
at
that
time.
i
might
say
that
in
response
to
the
questions
that
were
advanced
during
mr.
hoffman's
argument
that
except
for
the
four
petitions
for
certiorari
which
have
not
been
acted
upon
by
this
court,
all
of
them,
together
with
this
case,
constituting
a
flurry
of
objections
to
the
commission's
failure
to
grant,
to
treat
the
contract
as
marking
the
expiration
of
the
obligation
to
sell
arising
out
of
gwinville
field
and
the
questions
which
have
been
raised
by
sunray
and
the
preceding
case
and
in
this
and
other
group
of
cases
that
are
now
pending
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
one
case
by
--
originally
brought
by
(inaudible)
and
now
called
pan
american
which
is
pending.
with
those
exceptions,
i
think
there
have
been
no
applications
that
have
raised
this
question
that
is
now
raised.
no
applications
which
have
used
any
significantly
different
language
from
that
which
is
used
by
the
application
here.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
is
the
apprehension
that
this
would
handicap
the
commission's
administration,
effective
administration
of
the
act
which
it
seems
to
us
requires
that
7
(b)
be
given
the
interpretation
which
we
have
given
it.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
to
that
question
depends
on
the
answer
of
the
question
i
gave
you
before.
you've
asked
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
effect
of
the
contract
limitation
on
the
term
and
i
said
the
effect
of
the
contract
limitation
on
the
term
was
mobile,
that
is
to
say
that
the
seller
could
not
file
a
rate
in
violation
of
its
contract
but
when
its
contract
expired,
then
the
seller
could
unilaterally
file.
it
seemed
to
me
that
what
you're
asking
now,
it
says,
“could
the
--
in
effect
amounts
to
this,
could
the
commission
in
issuing
a
certificate
originally
say
that
you
must
contract
for
an
indefinite
term
which
means
that
you
would
extend
indefinitely
the
period
of
time
within
which
the
seller
could
not
unilaterally
file
in
violation
of
its
contract?”
and
that
would
depend
upon
whether
the
commission
found
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
permitted
such
an
arrangement.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
at
the
end
of
the
period,
he
can
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
that
as
long
as
the
7
(b)
is
given
the
interpretation
we
have
suggested
it
should
be,
that
the
consumer
--
that
the
commission
can
protect
the
consumer
interest
completely
as
the
act
intended.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
--
the
preceding
rate
was
7.36
cents
per
mcf.
the
new
rate,
so-called,
was
20
cents.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no,
no,
or
--
or
as
--
as
one
of
the
questions
before
it
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
were
reduced.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
if
they
had
wanted
to
do
that,
they
would
have
to
obtain
the
commission,
they
would
have
had
to
file
notice
of
the
termination
of
the
rate
schedule
and
they
would
have
had
to
apply
--
this
is
not
quite
clear.
our
practice
hasn't
answered
all
of
these
questions
yet,
but
they
would
either
have
to
get
permission
for
the
termination
of
the
sale
to
this
pipeline
and
then
apply
it
for
the
sale
to
the
new
one
as
a
new
transaction
or
have
applied
for
it
as
a
change
of
the
existing
transaction
by
substituting
a
different
purchaser
and
in
either
case,
the
commission
would
have
to
determine
whether
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
permitted
those
changes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i'm
not
prepared.
i'm
not
in
a
position
to
--
to
state
categorically
that
it
would
be
a
new
sale
just
by
reason
of
the
change
of
the
purchaser.
i
--
there
can
be
circumstances
under
which
the
change
of
the
purchaser
might
be
nominal,
might
not
have
the
effect
of
making
a
new
transaction
out
of
it.
that
question
has
not
been
settled
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
might
be
a
corporate
successor.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i'm
not
sure
what
all
the
factors
are,
which
might
make
it
a
new
sale
or
not
a
new
sale.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
to
determine
whether
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
require
the
issuance
of
a
certificate
for
the
new
--
the
new
service.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
or
impose
a
price
conditions
as
in
catco.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
but
it
would
still
not
meet
this,
if
your
honor
please,
that
all
of
the
cost
that
is
involved
in
laying
lines
to
get
the
gas
and
in
taking
it
where
it's
needed,
the
duplication
in
facilities
would
be
water
over
the
dam.
we
would
--
we
would
have
lost
the
old
--
the
old
arrangement.
we'd
have
no
power
or
control.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
we
could
take
into
account
but
its
spilled
milk
by
that
time,
if
i
understand
your
hypothetical
situation.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
[laughs]
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
conceivably,
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
conceivably,
the
commission
might
feel
that
it
was
in
a
position
by
refusing
approval
for
any
new
to
force
a
continuation
of
the
old
which
would
be
to
achieve
by
indirection
or
what
--
on
the
assumption,
the
commission
does
not
have
power
to
compel
directly.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
becomes
--
it
becomes
--
certainly
it
becomes
significant
now
for
that
reason.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
i
missed
the
first
question.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
we
could
still
proceed
under
5
(a).
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
and
that
does
not
have
the
benefit
of
the
suspension,
the
retroact
--
or
the
retroact.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
i
think
so.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
the
rate
--
we
have
to
act
within
30
days.
if
they
don't
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
act,
the
rate
goes
into
effect,
then
we
may
only
act
under
5
(a).
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
under
5
(a).
they
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
--
the
prospective
rate
fixing
after
we
initiate
and
carry
the
burden
of
proof
and
find
that
the
existing
rate
is
unlawful
and
prescribed
by
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
depends
upon
the
kind
of
proceeding
you're
talking
about,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
we
still
have
the
phillips
case
not
decided.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
don't
know
how
long
it's
been.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
too
long.
it's
been
--
your
honors
know
how
long
it's
been
since
the
--
the
phillips
case
in
june
of
1954.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no
major
producer
rate
case
contested.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
all
the
increases
are
under
suspension
and
are
being
processed
as
sun's
in
this
case.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
this
certainly
lands
--
underscores
the
importance
of
being
able
to
make
these
rates
retroactively
effective.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
think
it
is
not
inherent
in
the
statute.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no,
sir.
i'm
sorry
that
i
haven't
had
the
time
to
discuss
the
certificate
aspects
of
the
commission's
order.
i'll
have
to
rest
on
our
brief
on
that.
