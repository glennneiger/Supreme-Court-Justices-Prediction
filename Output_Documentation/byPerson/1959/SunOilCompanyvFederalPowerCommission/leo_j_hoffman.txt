mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
sun
oil
company
versus
federal
power
commission,
there
are
two
orders
of
the
federal
power
commission
involved.
i
would
like
to
state
briefly
the
nature
of
those
orders
and
then
i
think
it
would
be
worthwhile
to
inquire
briefly
into
the
chronology
of
the
development
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
first
of
the
orders
of
the
federal
power
commission
involved
in
this
case
is
a
letter
order
that
was
issued
by
the
federal
power
commission
under
date
of
september
12,
1957.
that
order
of
the
power
commission
purported
to
reject
a
new
--
a
new
contract
which
sun
oil
company,
the
petitioner,
had
filed
as
its
initial
rate
schedule
purported
to
reject
the
certificate
application
which
was
submitted
by
the
petitioner
covering
the
same
new
sale
that
was
covered
by
that
contract.
the
order
was
--
the
letter
order
was
issued
by
the
commission
on
the
ground
that
the
--
that
an
earlier
rate
schedule
and
an
earlier
certificate
were
duplicated
by
the
documents
currently
being
submitted
by
sun
oil
company,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
second
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
which
is
involved
in
this
case
is
a
formal
order
under
date
of
november
8,
1957
by
which
the
power
commission
suspended
the
same
new
contract
when
it
was
resubmitted
later
by
sun
on
a
protest
as
they
changed
in
its
earlier
rate
schedule.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
rejected
the
submittal
by
sun
of
--
of
a
new
contract
as
a
--
as
an
initial
rate
schedule.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
that's
right.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
the
power
commission
in
rejecting
the
submittal
of
that
contract
as
an
initial
rate
schedule
said
that
in
view
of
an
earlier
sale
accomplished
by
an
earlier
contract,
the
new
contract
can
only
be
changed
in
rate
schedule
and
would
have
to
be
resubmitted
as
a
change
in
rate
schedule
under
section
4
(d)
of
the
act
if
it
were
be
considered
at
all
by
the
power
commission.
so
the
--
the
submittal
as
an
initial
rate
schedule
and
the
submittal
of
an
accompanying
certificate
application
were
both
rejected
by
the
first
order.
i've
stated
the
ground
just
then
of
the
rejection
of
the
rate
schedule
essentially
the
same
basis
was
the
basis
for
the
rejection
of
the
certificate
application.
that
wasn't
the
earlier
certificate
covering
the
earlier
sale
under
an
earlier
contract
covered
continuing
service
are
duplicated,
the
--
the
current
filing
and
therefore,
the
current
filing
was
not
in
order.
and
as
i
say,
sun
resubmitted
the
contract
as
a
change
in
rate
schedule
under
protest
so
that
sun
would
not
be
further
penalized
pending
an
appeal
of
the
power
commission's
first
order.
and
by
the
second
order,
the
commission
did
suspend
the
--
the
submittal
of
that
contract
and
as
a
change
in
rate
schedule.
now,
the
court
below,
with
one
dissent,
affirmed
the
federal
power
commission
orders.
now,
i
would
to
state
briefly
in
chronological
order,
and
i
think
it's
worthwhile
to
do
so,
the
development
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
--
the
facts
are
relatively
simply,
and
i
think
can
be
briefly
stated.
chronologically,
in
the
development
of
this
--
of
this
story,
the
first
order
of
the
events
was
the
making
of
a
contract,
the
gas
purchase
and
sales
contract
between
sun
oil
company
and
southern
natural
gas
company.
southern
natural
gas
company
was
the
pipeline
buyer
under
the
--
under
the
contract.
the
contract
covered
the
sale
by
sun
oil
company
and
the
purchase
by
southern
natural
gas
company
of
gas
to
be
produced
from
sun's
properties
in
the
gwinville
field
which
is
located
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
the
contract
between
the
two
parties
which
appears
on
the
record
of
this
case
is,
in
our
view,
essentially
in
the
typical
form
of
a
producer's
gas
sales
contract.
there's
nothing
particularly
unusual
about
it.
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
most
important
feature
of
that
contract
was
that
it
provided
clearly
for
a
specific
term
of
10
years.
the
contract
provided
that
disagreement
shall
remain
enforced
in
effect
for
a
period
of
10
years
commencing
on
the
date
on
which
the
first
delivery
of
gas
is
made
by
a
seller
to
buyer
hereunder.
10
years
then,
no
more
and
no
less
starting
with
the
first
delivery
of
gas
under
the
contract.
now,
that
10-year
term
did
commence
on
september
3,
1947
because
that
was
the
date
of
the
first
delivery
of
gas
under
the
contract
and
the
contract
therefore
expire
by
its
own
terms
without
more
immediately
prior
to
september
3,
1957,
precisely
10
years
later.
now,
upon
the
advent
of
regulation
of
independent
producers
by
the
federal
power
commission
in
1954
following
this
court's
decision
in
the
phillips
case,
which
incidentally
occurred
about
three
years
before
the
expiration
of
the
10-year
term
contract
i've
mentioned
and
about
seven
years
after
that
contract
was
entered
into,
upon
the
advent
of
that
regulation,
sun
filed
a
contract
as
its
initial
rate
schedule
under
section
4
(c)
of
the
natural
gas
act.
that
filing
was
accepted
by
the
federal
power
commission.and
except
for
a
slight
change
in
the
--
in
the
price
that
occurred
in,
i
think,
1955
on
account
of
an
increase
in
tax
reimbursement
under
the
contract,
which
is
in
consequential
in
connection
with
this
case,
except
for
that,
the
power
commission
took
no
further
action
with
reference
to
that
rate
schedule
to
modify
the
rate
schedule
or
otherwise
during
the
term
of
the
contract.
now,
sun
filed
a
certificate
application
at
the
same
time
these
filings
occurred
in
the
latter
part
of
1954,
filed
a
certificate
application
to
cover
the
same
sale.
the
application
was
specifically
limited
to
the
sale
covered
by
the
1947
contract.
the
contract
was
referred
to
in
the
application
and
sun
requested
authority
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
continue
and
complete
that
specific
sale
by
reference
to
that
specific
contract.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
to
the
certificate
application,
sir?
yes,
sir.
that
appears
at
page
26
of
the
record.
i
would
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
now
that
i
have
the
record
open
at
that
point
to
page
28
of
the
record
in
which
at
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
statement
is
made
sun
wise
on
june
7,
1954,
the
date
of
the
phillips
decision
and
now
is
delivering
gas
subject
to
the
contract
for
the
following
purchasers,
southern
natural
gas
company
which
contract
has
either
been
heretofore
filed
or
is
being
filed
contemporaneously
herewith
as
a
rate
schedule.
that
contract
was
filed
contemporaneously
with
the
application
as
a
rate
schedule.
then
on
page
29
of
the
record,
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
the
page,
the
statement
is
made,
“this
application
is
hereby
made
only
for
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
authorizing
the
sale
of
natural
gas
in
the
circumstances
above
described
in
a
desire
view
that
the
circumstances
above
described
where
the
circumstances
in
connection
with
the
statement
as
to
the
sale,”
which
appears
on
the
preceding
page
in
the
record.
so
it
is
our
position
that
the
only
authority
requested
by
this
application
was
the
authority
to
continue
and
complete
the
particular
sale
under
the
particular
contract
that
have
been
entered
into
in
1947
for
a
specified
10-year
term.
now,
next
in
the
chronology
of
events,
in
1956,
the
commission
issued
a
certificate
authorizing
the
sale
described
in
sun's
application.
the
order
issuing
the
certificate
appears
in
the
record
at
page
99.
i
might
explain
by
way
of
comment
with
respect
to
this
order
issuing
the
certificate
that
this
was
an
order
issued
by
the
power
commission
in
a
consolidated
docket
situation
where
a
large
number
of
producers'
applications
for
certificates
were
consolidated
for
consideration
at
a
--
at
a
single
hearing.
sun
oil
company's
application
--
well,
i
--
i
should
say
first
that
each
--
each
application
was,
however,
although
consolidated
for
purposes
of
hearing,
considered
independently
and
separately
and
--
and
the
order
issuing
the
certificate
makes
that
clear.
sun
oil
company's
docket
with
respect
to
the
sale
involved
in
this
case
was
docket
number
g-6658
and
reference
is
made
in
the
order
at
--
to
that
docket
at
page
105
of
the
record
where
the
docket
is
stated
as
covering
the
sale
of
gas
from
the
gwinville
field
in
jefferson
davis
county,
mississippi
and
covering
the
sale
to
southern
natural
gas
company.
that's
just
part
of
the
caption
of
the
order.
this
order,
in
our
view,
specifically
granted
the
authority
requested
in
the
application.
it
specifically
authorized
the
sale,
the
--
the
very
sale
that
was
described
in
sun's
application.
the
certificate
--
the
certificate
order
contained
no
provision
that
is
purported
in
any
way
to
extend
the
term
of
the
sale
as
set
out
in
the
contract.
and
it
is
important
to
note
at
this
point,
i
believe,
that
the
order
was
issued
together
with
the
certificate
that
it
issued,
was
issued
under
the
commission's
shortened
procedure,
which,
by
virtue
of
the
commission's
rule,
is
based
upon
the
pleadings
alone.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
full
pledge
formal
hearing
in
connection
with
these
consolidated
applications.
they
were
all
considered
in
the
shortened
procedure
of
the
commission
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings.
the
only
pleading
in
connections
with
sun
oil
company's
docket
was
the
application
which
i
have
just
referred
to.
there
was
no
other
evidence
considered
by
the
commission
at
that
hearing
in
connection
with
sun
oil
company's
sale
other
than
its
own
application.
and
by
virtue
of
the
commission's
rules
under
the
shortened
procedure,
in
that
type
of
situation,
the
--
the
applicant
is
not
even
required
to
be
present
and
sun
oil
company
was
not
present
at
the
hearing
and
under
the
rules,
the
application
is
required
to
be
considered
upon
its
own
basis
without
a
consideration
of
other
evidence.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
there
--
yes.
there
was
a
formal
short
form
hearing.
of
course,
i
was
not
present.
no
one
else
was
for
sun
oil
company,
but
as
i
understand
the
procedure,
there
is
a
hearing
before
an
examiner
in
which
the
staff
counsel
of
the
commission
appears
with
the
files
and
pleadings.
now,
further,
in
the
chronology
of
events
--
i
may
come
back
to
the
certificate
order
shortly,
but
in
the
chronology
of
events
in
an
effort
to
get
the
facts
out
first
comes
the
contract
with
sun
oil
company
and
--
and
southern
natural
gas
company
entered
into
under
date
of
august
1,
1957.
this
was
a
complete
new
contract
that
did
not
purport
in
any
way
to
be
an
amendment
or
an
extension
of
the
earlier
contract
nor
was
it
contemplated
in
any
way
by
the
earlier
contract.
it
was
entered
into
between
sun
and
the
same
purchaser
and
it
did
to
cover
the
sale
of
gas
from
the
same
field
of
gwinville
field
in
mississippi.
but
it
had
no
direct
relationship
whatsoever
to
the
first
contract.
the
first
contact
expired
by
its
own
terms
at
the
expiration
of
its
own
stipulated
10-year
term.
the
second
contract
was
entered
into
for
a
term
commencing
the
day
following
the
expiration
of
the
preceding
contract.
but
the
second
contract
was
in
no
way
anticipated
or
contemplated
by
the
first
contract.
the
second
contract
was
entered
into
for
a
term
of
20
years
running
from
the
date
september
3,
1957.
the
date
immediately
following
the
expiration
of
the
first
contract.
it
is
our
position
that
it
in
no
way
duplicated
the
terms
of
the
first
contract.
now,
this
new
contract,
the
1957
contract
was
made
the
basis
for
additional
filings
with
the
federal
power
commission.
the
new
contract
was
submitted
by
sun
to
the
power
commission
as
an
initial
rate
schedule
under
section
4
(c)
of
the
natural
gas
act.
at
the
same
time,
sun
submitted
to
the
power
commission
a
--
a
certificate
application
requesting
authority
to
make
the
new
sale
under
the
1957
contract.
and
now,
in
the
chronology
of
events,
i
will
return
to
the
first
order
which
is
the
subject
of
this
case
and
that
is
the
letter
order
of
september
12,
1957
by
which
the
commission
rejected
sun's
certificate
application
saying
in
effect
that
the
first
certificate
covering
the
first
sale
still
applied
even
though
the
first
contact
had
expired
and
saying
with
reference
to
the
rate
schedule
in
effect
that
the
new
contract
was
in
the
commission's
view
a
change
in
the
existing
rate,
the
rate
established
by
the
1947
contract
and
could
--
could
not
be
filed
as
an
initial
rate
schedule
but
could
only
be
filed
as
a
change
in
rate
subject
to
force
to
suspension
under
sections
4
(d)
and
4
(e)
of
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
yes,
mr.
justice.
there
were
substantive
differences.
for
one
thing,
the
first
contract
is
related
with
--
for
a
term
of
10
years.
the
second
contract
was
for
a
term
of
20
years.
beyond
that,
there
were
substantial
differences
in
the
quantity
provisions
of
the
two
contracts.
as
i
recall,
the
--
the
contract
quantity
obligation
on
the
buyer's
part
under
the
first
contract
was
based
on
the
percentage
of
the
buyer's
total
pipeline
requirements.
although
i'm
--
i'm
paraphrasing
that,
of
course,
because
it
goes
on
for
several
pages
in
the
contract,
but
it
was
based
on
the
percentage
of
requirements,
whereas,
in
the
second
contract,
the
quantity
obligation
of
buyer
was
based
on
a
--
an
entirely
different
concept.
it
was
a
stipulated
percentage
of
the
total
deliverability
of
the
gas
wells
that
sun
oil
company
had
located
upon
its
properties
in
the
gwinville
gas
field.
there
were
other
differences
too,
the
details
of
which
i
might
not
be
able
to
recall
offhand
having
to
do
with
quality
provisions
and
some
other
things.
now,
after
the
rejection,
sun
resubmitted
the
--
the
new
contract,
as
i
have
already
stated
briefly,
under
protest
as
a
change
in
its
earlier
rate
schedule.
sun
made
that
filing
of
the
new
contract,
the
second
filing
as
a
change
in
rate
schedule
to
avoid
being
further
penalized
by
the
power
commission's
rejection
of
its
first
filing
of
the
contract
as
an
initial
rate
schedule.
and
meanwhile,
sun,
of
course,
commenced
the
procedure
looking
to
this
appeal
from
a
rejection
order.
now,
again,
the
second
order,
chronologically,
that's
the
subject
of
this
case
is
that
at
november
8,
1957
by
which
sun's
resubmittal
of
the
contract
as
a
change
in
rate
schedule
was
suspended
for
the
full
statutory
period
of
five
months.
sun
appealed
a
suspension
order
as
it
did
the
rejection
order
because
the
suspension
order
itself
treated
the
new
contract
as
a
change
in
rate
rather
than
as
a
separate
new
initial
rate
schedule
and
also
because
if
the
rejection
order
--
the
first
order
is
invalid,
the
suspension
order
is
obviously
invalid
because
it
is
furnished
on
the
first
order.
and
as
i
have
said
the
court
below
affirmed
the
two
orders
with
one
dissent.
issues
in
this
case
can
well
be
considered,
i
believe,
in
two
categories
of
--
of
matters.
so
one
category
would
be
a
consideration
of
the
certificate
matter
and
another
category
would
be
consideration
of
the
--
of
the
rate
schedule
matter.
i
would
like
to
consider
first
in
my
argument
the
certificate
matter.
it
is
our
position
that
sun's
certificate
application
covering
its
1947
contract
only
requested
authority
to
continue
and
complete
that
particular
sale
that
was
the
subject
of
the
1947
contract
which
is
i
stated
had
about
three
years
to
run
by
its
own
term
at
the
time
the
certificate
application
was
filed.
that
contract
was
specifically
made
the
basis
as
i've
read
from
the
record.
we
believe
that
that
type
of
application
wasn't
limited
to
the
specific
sale
covered
by
the
contract
in
--
of
1947
was
in
keeping
with
section
7
(c)
of
the
act
which
requires
a
certificate
for
the
act
of
engaging
in
a
sale.
it
is
our
position
that
the
--
that
the
term
sale
within
the
meaning
of
section
7
(c)
of
the
act
is
a
term
that
is
represented
in
this
case
by
sun's
1947
contract
including
its
specifically
limited
and
stipulated
term.
it
is
our
position
in
addition
that
sun
could
not
have
applied
for
more
even
if
it
had
desire
to
do
so
since
section
7
(e)
of
the
act
requires
the
finding
that
--
to
be
made
the
commission
that
the
applicant
is
able
and
willing
to
do
the
acts
proposed.
sun
was
not
able
in
1954
at
the
time
it
filed
a
certificate
of
application
with
regard
to
its
1947
contract
to
show
unableness
or
willingness
to
do
more
than
continue
and
complete
the
sale
which
was
covered
by
its
1947
contract
because
at
that
time,
it
had
no
further
contract
beyond
the
10-year
term
of
that
contract.
it
had
no
further
purchaser
available
to
it
beyond
the
10-year
term
of
the
contract.
so
its
application,
in
our
view,
was
in
complete
keeping
with
that
phrasing
of
section
7
(e)
of
the
act.
it
was
also
in
keeping
with
the
phrasing
of
section
7
(e)
which
requires
that
the
certificate
be
issued
by
the
federal
power
commission
authorizing
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
sale
which
is
covered
by
the
application
in
connection
with
the
whole
or
any
part
phrasing
which
by
the
way
appears
in
our
brief
at
page
--
beginning
at
the
top
of
page
61.
it
provides
that
certificate
shall
be
issued
to
any
qualified
applicant
therefore
--
therefore
and
authorizing
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
operation,
sale,
service,
construction,
extension
or
acquisition
covered
by
the
application.
it
is
our
view
that
sun's
application
was
also
in
keeping
with
that
phrasing,
the
--
the
whole
or
any
part
phrasing
because
by
virtue
of
section
7
(e),
the
commission
would
not
be
authorized
to
issue
a
certificate
which
might
cover
more
than
the
whole
of
the
sale
which
was
made
the
subject
to
the
application.
the
whole
of
the
sale
in
this
case
was
represented
by
the
limits
of
the
term
of
the
1947
contract,
a
certificate
authorizing
or
even
requiring
a
sale
beyond
the
duration
of
that
contract
would
be
a
certificate
which
would
represent
more
than
the
whole
of
the
subject
to
the
application
and
therefore
would
not
be
authorized.
and
sun's
application
was
in
keeping
with
that
phrasing.
the
application,
as
i
have
already
mentioned,
referred
to
the
contract
and
concluded
with
a
statement
that
this
application
is
hereby
made
only
for
a
certificate
authorizing
the
sale
of
natural
gas
in
the
circumstances
above
described.
the
critical
word
--
one
of
the
critical
words
in
this
portion
of
the
statute
is,
of
course,
the
term
“sale”.
the
act
does
not
define
the
term
“sale”
and
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
act
that
the
term
has
anything
other
than
its
accepted
legal
meaning,
which
is
briefly
stated
in
act
evidenced
by
contract.
that's
a
sale.
and
it
is
our
view
that
the
--
that
congress
intended
by
these
various
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act,
including
70
particularly
in
the
use
of
the
word
“sale”
to
carry
along
the
ordinary
legal
connotation
of
that
term.
there's
no
indication
otherwise
anywhere
in
the
natural
gas
act.
now,
that
was
the
kind
of
--
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
that
is
also
our
position.
yes,
sir.
the
sale
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
did
not
represent
a
service.
now,
the
service
argument
is
made
at
great
length
in
the
federal
power
commission's
brief.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
yes,
sir.
of
course,
i
am
speaking
--
although
i
may
speak
in
generalities
in
--
in
some
statements,
i
--
i
am
speaking
specifically
with
reference
to
the
development
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
and
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
this
contract
of
1947,
which
is
the
critical
contract
in
connection
with
a
certificate
authorize
--
authorization
represented
and
covered
a
sale
of
gas
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
gas
act
and
all
parts
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
did
not
constitute
an
agreement
for
the
performance
of
the
service
within
the
meaning
of
some
other
portions
of
the
natural
gas
act.
that's
particularly
--
it's
particularly
important
to
note
in
that
connection,
i
think,
that
a
contract,
and
this
is
why
i
mentioned
the
time
a
moment
ago
that
contract
was
entered
into
in
1947
about
seven
years
before
the
power
commission
actively
undertook
the
regulation
of
independent
producers
of
gas.
and
certainly,
as
between
the
parties
in
1947,
the
contract
was
--
contract
entered
into
under
the
ordinary
conditions
of
the
market
place,
you
might
say,
by
which
one
party
agreed
to
sell
what
was
to
him
a
commodity
and
the
other
party
agreed
by
what
was
to
him
a
commodity.
no
service
whatsoever.
in
fact,
there
is
language
in
the
contract
which
specifically
purports
to
make
clear
that
that
sort
of
concept
was
not
to
be
involved
in
the
making
of
this
contract.
i
--
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
that.
that
contract
appears
in
the
record
at
page
32.
this
is
the
1947
contract
that
i'm
referring
to.
and
under
the
price
provisions
--
i
can't
find
them
now.
yes,
on
page
46
of
the
record.
there
is
an
article
11,
which
is
titled
“price”.
article
11
first
provides
for
a
price
of
7.5
cents
for
the
first
five
years
of
the
term
and
then
8
cents
for
the
second
five
years
of
the
term
and
then
this
paragraph.
in
this
connection,
it
is
understood
that
by
this
agreement,
seller
is
not
dedicating
the
buyer
or
the
buyers
marked
out
at
any
portion
of
seller's
gas
reserves
in
the
gwinville
gas
field
or
any
portion
of
a
gas
produced
by
seller
from
its
wells
in
said
field
but
that
seller
is
simply
selling
and
buyer
is
purchasing
the
quantity
of
gas
called
for
in
this
agreement
and
so
on.
part
of
the
purpose
in
design
of
--
of
that
provision
in
the
contract
was
to
make
clear
that
this
was
not
the
type
of
utility
service
agreement
which
the
power
commission
makes
so
much
of
in
its
brief
in
this
case.
this
was
a
simple
sale
and
purchase
of
commodity
on
a
large
scale
and
a
rather
unusual
commodity
but
nevertheless
a
purchase
and
sale
agreement.
and
we're
convinced
that
within
the
meaning
of
all
of
the
phrasing
of
the
natural
gas
act,
it
comes
this
contract
represents
and
constitutes
a
sale.
as
a
matter
fact
too,
it's
the
same
type
of
sale
that
this
court
referred
to
in
the
atlantic
refining
company
case
that's
popularly
known
as
the
catco
case
where
the
--
where
this
court
made
the
point
that
the
federal
power
commission
had
--
had
found
with
reference
to
the
contract
involved
there,
the
sales
contract
involved
there
which,
by
the
way,
was
the
largest
ever
made,
as
i
understand
it,
by
producers
up
to
that
time.
the
federal
power
commission
had
found
that
that
was
the
largest
single
sale
of
natural
gas
ever
made
by
producers
prior
to
that
time
to
a
pipeline
company.
the
court
recognized
the
power
commission's
finding.
and
the
power
commission
had
made
a
finding
that
that
was
itself,
that
tremendous
contract
of
that
magnitude
was
a
single
sale,
represented
a
single
sale
within
the
meaning
of
the
natural
gas
act.
we
think
too
that
that's
the
effect
of
the
court's
mobile
decision
and
the
court's
memphis
decision.
the
--
the
court
has
said
that
the
act
advances
no
purpose
to
abrogate
private
contracts
and
the
court
has
said
in
the
mobile
case
that
the
single
statutory
scheme
of
the
natural
gas
act
is
to
permit
natural
gas
companies
to
have
the
initial
rate
setting
power.
in
other
words,
as
we
view
it,
the
--
the
whole
theme
of
the
mobile
decision,
the
memphis
decision
is
that
this
sort
of
thing
under
the
natural
gas
act,
the
sort
of
thing
that
is
involved
in
sun's
case
is
to
be
determined
according
to
the
terms
of
the
contracts
subject
of
course
to
the
commission's
overwriting
review
authority,
which
we
don't
question
in
this
case,
the
overwriting
review
authority,
but
which
authority
was
not
exercised
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
but
we
think
this
case
comes
well
within
the
scope
of
the
mobile
decision
and
the
memphis
decision.
and
one
application
of
the
mobile
decision
which
can
properly
be
made
is
in
determining
the
--
the
meaning
and
the
extent
and
the
scope
of
the
word
“sale”
as
it
appears,
for
example,
in
section
7
(c)
and
7
(e)
of
the
natural
gas
act.
i've
been
talking
about
the
applications.
the
certificate
issued
by
the
commission
in
1956
in
response
to
that
application
authorized
only
the
sale
that
was
described
in
the
application.
hence,
the
certificate
having
granted
the
application
for
the
specific
sale,
we
say,
did
not
extend
beyond
the
life
of
the
contract
of
sale.
the
certificate
expired
then
when
the
contract
expired.
again,
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
location
of
the
order
issuing
the
certificate
at
page
99.
the
certificate
covered
--
covering
the
first
sale
was
issued,
as
i
have
already
mentioned
in
the
power
commission
shortened
procedure
and
we
think
that's
significant
in
this
case
because
that
means
that
it
was
issued
on
the
basis
of
the
application
alone.
there
was
no
other
evidence.
it
could
not
have
granted
more
than
the
application
requested,
which
was
the
certificate
to
expire
with
the
expiration
of
the
contract
and
it's
important
to
note
that
it
was
not
even
necessary
in
that
procedure
for
sun
to
be
represented
at
the
hearing.
the
certificate
order
in
the
ordering
paragraphs
commenced
at
the
bottom
of
page
109
of
the
record
--
well,
let
me
first
refer
to
the
findings
which
commence
near
the
top
of
page
109.
the
certificate
order
found
that
sun
oil
company
was
able
and
willing
to
do
the
acts
proposed.
that
appears
in
paragraph
3
at
the
middle
of
page
109.
the
applicant
is
able
and
willing
properly
to
do
the
acts
and
to
perform
the
service
proposed
and
conformed
with
the
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
requirements,
rules
and
regulation
of
the
commission
thereunder.
the
only
thing
sun
had
opposed
was
the
continuation
and
completion
of
its
1947
contract.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
sun
was
unable
to
do
more
or
show
any
ability
to
do
more
because
it
had
no
further
contract
and
no
further
purchaser
at
that
time
even
at
the
time
this
order
was
issued
in
1956.
and
now,
the
ordering
paragraphs
which
commenced
at
the
bottom
of
page
109,
paragraph
(a)
at
the
bottom
of
page
109,
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
be
and
is
hereby
issued
upon
the
terms
and
conditions
of
this
order
authorizing
the
sale
by
applicant
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale
and
so
on
concluding
and
as
more
fully
described
in
the
application
and
exhibits
in
this
proceeding.
and
with
respect
to
sun's
sale
to
southern
natural
gas
company
from
the
gwinville
field,
the
only
sale
which
was
the
subject
to
the
application
was
the
sale
described
in
its
application
and
the
--
and
the
sale
which
was
the
subject
of
the
1947
contract.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
i
think
this
language,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
frequently
used.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
it's
typically
used
by
the
federal
commission.
it
certainly
was
within
my
own
knowledge
during
the
period
of
time
in
which
this
order
was
issued
as
far
as
i
know
it's
still
typical
language.
i
--
i
think
the
order
issuing
the
certificate
recognized
that
sun
was
not
--
it
could
not
make
the
able
and
willing,
showing
that
would
be
required
in
order
to
--
for
sun
to
acquire
a
certificate
extending
beyond
the
duration
of
its
1947
contract.
the
ordering
paragraph,
as
i
said,
issued
a
certificate
authorizing
the
sale
as
described
in
the
order
and
the
sale
is
more
fully
described
in
the
application
and
the
sale
referred
to
can
only
be
the
sale
covered
by
the
only
contract
that
was
referred
to
in
the
application.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
well,
your
honor,
this
application
did
--
i
mean,
this
order
did
consider
applications
for
permanent
certificates.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
yes,
sir.
well,
i
don't
know
that
that
--
that
very
phrase
is
used
in
this
order
but
--
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
well,
actually,
i
have
no
knowledge
of
the
other
applications.
i
should
correct
that
statement,
too.
there
are
other
sun
oil
company
applications
which
were
--
as
to
which
certificates
were
issued
by
this
same
order.
they're
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
i
have
some
familiarity
with
those
and
as
i
recall,
the
other
sun
oil
company
matters
that
were
involved
in
this
same
order
were
on
essentially
the
same
form
of
application
as
the
one
involved.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
yes.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
yes,
sir.
that's
generally
true
of
all
of
sun's
contracts,
which
were
the
subject
of
this
--
of
this
order.
they
were
for
a
specified
term
of
years
in
each
case.
the
same
result
that
i
have
mentioned
thus
far
is
reached,
although
i've
been
talking
primarily
about
section
7
(c)
and
--
and
only
indirectly
about
7
(e),
the
same
result
is
reached
under
the
language
of
section
7
(e)
of
the
act
which,
as
i
have
already
mentioned,
requires
the
issuance
of
the
certificate
authorizing
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
sale
covered
by
the
application.
i've
talked
about
the
able
and
willing
phrase,
the
whole
or
any
part
phrase
is
likewise
significant
in
this
connection.
sun's
sale
was
set
out
in
its
1947
contract
and
it
--
requiring
the
sale
beyond
the
duration
of
that
contract
would
constitute
certification
of
more
than
the
whole
of
the
sale
proposed
by
the
application
which
we
say
is
permitted
by
that
language
of
section
7
(e).
but,
regardless
of
the
phrasing
of
section
7
of
the
act,
the
certificate
actually
issued,
in
our
view,
the
certificate
actually
issued
by
the
federal
power
commission
did
no
more
than
authorize
the
particular
sale
involved
by
virtue
of
its
own
and
its
very
words.
in
other
words,
although
we
do
not
recognize
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
issue
a
certificate
authorizing
more
than
the
whole
of
the
sale
as
evidenced
by
the
contract,
at
the
same
time,
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
issue
here
because
it
is
also
our
position
first
that
by
virtue
of
the
very
order
that
issued
the
certificate,
the
commission
itself
limited
the
certificate
authorization
to
the
particular
sale
that
sun
had
accomplished
by
virtue
of
its
contract
in
19
--
entered
into
in
1947.
that's
true
also
that
is
that
the
certificate
itself
limited
the
authorization
to
the
duration
of
the
contract.
that's
true
also
because
the
certificate
did
not
even
purport
to
condition
the
certificates
so
as
to
make
it
one
of
unlimited
duration.
assuming
the
commission
had
the
--
that
kind
of
conditioning
authority,
this
certificate
did
not
purport
to
exercise
any
such
authority.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
well,
our
practice
had
been
to
file
certificate
applications
in
the
very
form
in
which
this
application
was
filed.
i
think
perhaps
some
of
the
other
companies
had
filed
some
applications
which
in
--
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
--
expressed
words
--
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
(voice
overlap)
limited
term.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
realize
now
that
i
misinterpreted
one
question
that
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
me
and
i
would
like
to
correct
my
misinterpretation
now.
when
you
asked
me,
sir,
whether
any
--
within
my
knowledge,
whether
any
of
the
applications
which
were
granted
by
the
order
issued
by
the
commission,
the
order
appearing
at
page
99
of
the
record,
whether
any
of
those
applications
requested
permanent
authority,
i
--
i
thought
at
the
moment
that
you
were
drawing
a
distinction
between
permanent
authority
and
temporary
authority.
the
commission
does
have
a
procedure
for
issuing
temporary
authorization
as
you
know
and
i
--
i
made
the
comment
that
to
my
knowledge,
all
of
these
applications
involved
permanent
authorization
request
but
i
meant
permanent
as
distinguished
from
temporary
authority.
i
did
not
mean
request
for
unlimited
duration
of
sale
or
service
as
distinguished
--
with
limited
duration.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
my
basic
answer
is
still
the
same.i'm
not
familiar
with
the
applications
other
than
those
of
sun
oil
company
which
are
involved
in
this
order.
and
it
is
true
that
all
of
the
applications
filed
by
sun
which
were
covered
by
this
order,
the
commission
were
in
essentially
the
same
form
as
the
one
that
is
involved
in
this
particular
case.
in
connection
with
the
section
7
matter,
the
certificate
matter,
sun
asserts
then
that
in
1954,
it
requested
a
certificate
which
would
coincide
with
the
remaining
term
of
its
1947
contract.
and
that
in
1956,
by
virtue
of
the
order
that
appears
at
page
99
of
the
record,
it
received
such
a
limited
duration
certificate.
that
in
1957,
when
sun's
new
contract
became
effective,
the
certificate
for
the
first
sale
had
expired
and
that
finally
sun
was
entitled
to
file
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
authorizing
the
new
sale
which
had
been
accomplished
by
its
1957
contract.
now,
the
power
commission
has
contented
in
its
brief
that
in
the
1956
certificate
order,
the
commission
authorized
some
sort
of
service
which
was
not
merely
for
the
remainder
of
the
term
of
the
1947
contract.
we
submit
that
that
argument
essentially
begs
the
issue
which
is
involved
here
because
whether
sun's
acts,
as
authorized
by
the
commission
order,
be
characterized
as
a
sale
or
a
service,
the
contract
determine
--
determines
the
duration
of
the
acts
undertaken.
now,
we
assert,
and
i
have
stated
earlier
today
that
in
our
view,
the
acts
and
operations
covered
by
sun's
1947
contract
did
not
constitute
a
service,
rather
they
constituted
and
represented
the
sale.
but
nevertheless,
even
if
it
be
--
if
those
acts
be
characterized
as
constituting
a
service,
the
term
of
that
service,
if
you
please,
is
still
the
determined
by
the
term
of
the
1947
contract.
we
think
that
that
is
in
keeping
with
a
single
statutory
scheme
of
the
act
as
was
explained
in
the
mobile
station
and
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
it's
likewise
clear
from
the
language
of
the
act
itself.
we
think
that
the
certificate
issued
by
the
commission
was
completely
cleared
in
authorizing
the
acts
for
which
authority
had
been
requested
by
sun's
application
however
those
acts
may
be
characterized.
now,
i
would
like
to
take
some
time
to
talk
about
the
rate
schedule
matter
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
and
again,
i
wish
to
emphasize
in
connection
with
the
rate
schedule
matter
that
when
the
new
contract
became
effective,
the
old
contract
had
expired
and
terminated
and
emphasize
too
that
the
new
contract
was
not
an
extension
nor
an
amendment
of
the
old
contract.
the
new
contract
represented
a
complete
unrelated
sale
which
was
not
even
contemplated
by
the
earlier
contract.
now,
under
section
4
(c)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
we
have
the
--
the
provisions
which
relate
to
initial
rate
schedule
filing.
section
4
(c)
of
the
act
appears
in
our
main
brief
at
page
56,
the
paragraph
commencing
at
the
top
of
the
page.
it
is
our
view
that
section
4
(c)
requires
the
filing
of
an
initial
rate
schedule
for
any
jurisdictional
sale,
and
the
act
reads
in
those
terms.
in
--
within
the
scope
of
those
terms,
our
1947
contract
represented
a
sale,
and
under
section
4
(c)
of
the
--
of
the
act,
the
duration
of
the
rate
schedule,
the
initial
rate
schedule
which
was
filed
for
the
1947
contract
under
section
4
(c),
the
duration
was
determined
by
the
duration
of
the
contract.
and
i'm
speaking
of
the
duration
of
both
the
rate
schedule
and
the
contract
which
comprised
the
rate
schedule.
because
there
again,
the
essential
word
is
the
word
“sale”
and
in
our
view,
the
word
“sale”,
everywhere
in
the
act,
including
this
place
in
the
act,
has
its
ordinary
legal
connotation.
it's
an
act
or
series
of
acts,
if
you
please,
evidenced
by
contract.
and
in
sun's
case,
the
acts
of
sale
were
evidenced
by
the
1947
contract.
so
that
by
virtue
of
the
very
language
of
4
(c),
the
1947
contract
determined
the
duration
of
the
rate
schedule
which
sun
had
filed
in
accordance
with
4
(c).
now,
likewise,
the
1957
contract,
being
a
separate
unrelated
sale
and
representing
a
separate
unrelated
sale,
has
section
4
(c)
separately
applicable
to
it,
representing
a
separate
independent
sale
not
contemplated
by
any
other
sale.
it,
likewise,
is
filable
under
section
4
(c)
of
the
act
as
an
initial
rate
schedule.
by
the
same
token,
section
4
(d),
which
likewise
appears
on
page
56
of
our
main
brief,
is
not
applicable
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
it
applies
to
a
change
in
rate
or
rate
schedule.
and
our
1957
contract
was
not
actually
a
change
in
the
1947
contract.
the
1947
contract
had
expired.
it
did
not
exist
when
the
1957
contract
became
effective.
and
--
the
1947
contract
and
the
rate
schedule
which
it
--
which
it
comprised
no
longer
existed
to
be
changed
or
existed
as
the
basis
for
any
change.
the
same
again
is
true
of
the
existence
of
a
contract,
as
a
contract
or
as
a
rate
schedule.
when
sun
filed
and
the
federal
power
commission
accepted
the
1947
contract,
the
sun's
rate
schedules,
it's
our
position
that
all
of
its
terms
became
sun's
rate
schedule,
including
the
termination
day.
when
the
contract
expired,
the
rate
schedule
likewise
expired.
we
think
that's
the
--
the
effect
of
section
4
(c)
and
it
follows
naturally
that
--
that
if
that
is
the
effect
of
--
of
section
4
(c),
that
--
that
4
(d)
cannot
be
applicable
because
the
1957
contract
would
not
constitute
a
change
in
the
earlier
contract.
section
4
(d)
bares
out
that
interpretation
because
the
opening
language
is
in
this
phrasing
unless
the
commission
otherwise
orders
no
change
shall
be
made
by
any
natural
gas
company
in
any
such
rate,
charge,
classification
or
service
or
any
rule,
regulation
or
contract
relating
thereto
and
so
on
except
upon
notice
to
the
commission.
such
rate
charge
classification
and
service
and
such
contract
relates
back
in
our
view
to
contract
or
--
or
rate
or
rate
schedule
which
had
been
filed
under
section
4
(c)
and
which
is
then
and
still
in
existence
a
change
in
a
rate
schedule
which
otherwise
continues
to
exist.
i
think
that's
also
born
out
for
the
down
in
section
4
(d)
where
the
language
reads
that
such
notice
shall
be
given
by
filing
wit
the
commission
and
keeping
open
for
public
inspection
and
so
on.
the
change
or
changes
to
be
made
in
the
schedule
or
schedules
then
enforce
in
a
time
when
the
change
or
changes
going
to
effect.
sun's
1947
contract
as
a
rate
schedule
was
not
then
enforced
at
the
time
its
1957
contract
became
effective.
and
therefore,
by
virtue
of
that
phrasing,
particularly
the
words
then
enforce
sun's
contract
--
the
latter
contract
had
not
constitute
a
change
in
the
earlier
contract
or
in
the
rate
schedule
that
was
filed
for
the
earlier
contract.
now,
sun's
interpretation
does
not
leave
the
power
commission
without
any
power
of
review
of
the
new
contract,
if
it
is
--
even
if
it
is
properly
treated
as
an
initial
rate
schedule
because
our
interpretation
still
leaves
the
power
commission
with
its
full
section
5
(a)
authority
under
which
it
can
modify
an
initial
rate
schedule
after
hearing
and
after
making
certain
findings.
but
i
say
again
that
no
section
5
(a)
authority
was
exercise
here
and
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
in
the
record
of
this
case.
we
think
sun's
contentions
as
to
sections
--
section
4
of
the
act
supported
by
the
power
commission's
own
regulations
and
we
have
so
stated
in
our
brief,
but
i
won't
go
into
the
regulations
here.
we
think
also
that
the
commission's
orders
are
plain
in
conflict
with
this
--
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
mobile
case
as
it
was
confirmed
later
in
the
memphis
case.
the
court
said
in
mobile
that
the
act,
the
gas
act
does
not
abrogate
private
contracts
that
the
initial
rate
making
powers
with
the
natural
gas
company
that
the
power
commission's
power
is
one
of
review
of
rates
determined
initially
by
the
natural
gas
companies.
we
say
that
sun's
1947
and
1957
contracts
were
each
an
exercise
separately
and
independently
of
sun's
initial
rate
setting
power
within
the
scope
of
the
act
and
within
the
scope
of
the
mobile
decision.
in
the
light
of
mobile
and
memphis,
the
suspension
power
of
the
power
commission
is
actually
not
available
to
it
here
whether
a
change
in
rate
schedule
occurs
is
to
be
determined
from
the
contracts.
and
here,
no
amendment
or
supplement
or
other
change
in
the
1947
contact
occurred.
it
simply
expired
by
its
own
terms
and
section
4
(e),
the
suspension
provisions
are
therefore
not
applicable.
the
lower
court
based
its
decision
that
the
1957
contract
was
a
change
under
section
4
(d)
on
two
of
its
own
earlier
decisions.
but
those
cases
related
to
price
adjustments
which
occurred
under
the
terms
of
continuing
contracts,
contracts
which
would
otherwise
still
be
enforced.
and
we
say
those
cases
are
not
applicable
to
this
case.
the
court
referred
to
those
cases
and
then
continued
that
it
necessarily
followed
from
those
cases
that
where
sun
made
a
new
contract
which
was
for
the
same
service,
the
court
used
that
expression
as
the
old
contract,
the
new
contact
represented
a
change.
in
our
view,
the
cases
cited
by
the
court
did
not
begin
to
support
the
proposition,
and
the
proposition
as
to
same
service
was
merely
asserted
by
the
court
with
no
cited
support,
whatsoever.
the
commission
uses
the
same
proposition
in
our
--
in
its
brief.
we
have
pointed
out
in
considerable
detail
in
our
reply
brief
how
our
sales,
neither
sale
constituted
a
service,
but
in
any
event,
whether
a
sale
or
a
service,
the
scope
of
it,
the
duration
of
it
is
determined
under
mobile
and
under
the
language
of
the
act
by
the
duration
and
scope
of
the
contract
itself.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
well,
we
also
take
the
position
which
it
isn't
necessary
to
--
to
reach
here
of
course,
but
assuming
what
you've
said,
we
also
take
the
position
that
even
if,
by
some
stretch
of
the
imagination,
the
original
certificate
which
was
issued
in
1956,
be
deemed
to
cover
successive
sales
from
the
same
field
and
we'll
say
the
--
the
same
pipeline
purchaser,
nevertheless,
under
sections
--
under
section
4
(c)
of
the
act,
sun's
second
contract,
the
contract
that
was
entered
into
1957
constitutes
an
original
or
rather
an
initial
rate
schedule
and
does
not
constitute
a
change
within
the
meaning
of
section
4
(d)
of
the
act.
i
--
i
think
that
the
term
“sale”
should
have
the
same
meaning
in
both
section
4
and
section
7
of
the
act
and
that's
precisely
why
we
argue
in
this
case
that
in
the
same
terms
with
respect
to
both
sections
that
the
certificate
came
to
an
end
under
section
7
when
the
contract
came
to
an
end,
likewise
the
rate
schedule
came
to
an
end
when
the
contract
came
to
an
end
so
that
we
could
start
all
over
again
with
initial
rate
schedule
and
new
certificate
application.
but
even
if
--
if
the
other
statement
were
true,
still
a
new
contract,
in
our
view,
represents
an
initial
rate
schedule
and
not
a
change.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
at
this
point,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
sometime
in
the
closing.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
minutes
available
to
me,
there
are
several
points
which
i
would
like
to
go
over.
it
was
suggested
by
mr.
wahrenbrock
at
one
point
in
his
discussion
that
if
sun's
position
were
correct,
the
only
procedure
available
to
the
federal
power
commission
would
be
a
procedure
under
section
5
(a)
of
the
act
--
excuse
me
--
which
would
be
a
prospective
investigation
in
regulation
and
the
prospective
eventual
reduction
in
rate
possibly.
and
now,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
in
connection
with
section
5
(a)
which
is
an
available
authority
of
the
commission
in
this
connection
that
it
represents
a
real
power
on
this
--
on
the
part
of
the
commission.
it
--
it
is
the
overwriting
review
part
that
the
court
had
in
mind
in
mobile
case
when
it
said
that
otherwise,
initial
rate
setting
is
to
be
done
by
--
by
the
natural
gas
companies.
it
--
it
--
as
mr.
wahrenbrock
mentioned
at
one
point
that
it
so
happens
that
sun
oil
company
is
presently
involved
in
the
section
5
(a)
proceeding,
not
going
on
before
power
commission
examiner.
so
sun
knows
that
this
is
a
real
power.
i
might
mention
in
passing
that
at
the
present
stage
of
adhering,
which
is
in
progress
now
before
federal
power
commission
examiner,
the
evidence
thus
far
presented
shows
a
cost
of
sale
to
the
extent
that
that
sort
of
thing
has
any
validity
in
the
regulatory
scheme,
the
cost
of
sale
substantially
in
excess
of
the
new
price
involved
in
this
second
gwinville
field
contract
that
is
involved
here.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
yes,
sir.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
we
are
controlled
by
the
scope
of
the
natural
gas
act.
and
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
the
delay
is
inherent
in
the
administrative
process
if
there
are
delays
at
all
are
not
relevant
here.
the
commission
has
certain
power
under
the
gas
act
that
has
been
determined
as
not
having
certain
other
powers
under
the
gas
act.
we
say
that
sun
oil
company
is
--
is
entitled
to
a
full
and
fair
consideration
of
the
regulatory
scheme
as
it
should
be
applied
to
it
under
the
gas
act.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
oh,
i
suppose
that's
possible.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
i
--
i
will
leave
and
concede
the
pertinence
of
the
matter,
except
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
i
--
i
don't
think
the
delay
is
inherent
in
--
in
--
that
the
application
of
section
5
(a)
of
the
act
are
pertinent
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
--
there
are
other
powers
available
to
the
commission
too
which
were
generated
in
the
later
discussion
occurring
during
mr.
wahrenbrock's
argument.
one
of
the
other
powers
has
to
do
with
the
--
the
conditioning
power
that
the
commission
has
on
a
certificate
proceeding
which
the
court
recognized
in
the
catco
case.
that
may
be
available
to
adhere.
and
i
might
--
i
might
be
--
in
connection
with
our
second
certificate
application,
i
might
say
in
passing
in
that
connection
that
i
--
i
think
one
of
the
points
involved
here
is
that
this
so-called
--
this
20-cent
price
that
appears
in
sun's
second
contract
has
in
fact
--
in
effect
already
been
passed
on
by
the
commission
in
another
full
pledge
certificate
proceeding,
which
was
held,
by
the
way,
subsequent
to
the
court's
decision
in
the
catco
case
and
was
decided
in
the
light
of
the
principles
announced
in
the
catco
case.
and
this
involved
a
gas
sale
in
a
neighboring
field,
to
the
gwinville
field
that
we've
been
discussing
and
--
and
the
commission
approved
under
catco
principles,
priced
somewhat
higher
than
the
price
that's
involved
in
sun's
second
contract
here.
but
nevertheless,
the
conditioning
power,
as
a
general
proposition,
is
available
to
the
commission
in
this
type
of
situation.
it
has
the
5
(a)
power
and
it
has
the
conditioning
power
under
section
7
--
7
(e).
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
it
could
refuse
the
certificate
if
it
is
decided
as
a
result
of
the
hearing
that
the
--
that
the
certificate
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest
and
then
leave
the
applicant
to
do
with
that
--
what
he
chooses.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
he
can
go
home
or
he
can
go
home
and
come
back
later
with
another
certificate
application
--
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
--
that
might
better
please
the
commission.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
i
beg
you
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
yes,
i
think
the
commission
has
that
within
its
power.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
well,
i
--
i
think
that
it
is
subject
to
the
conditioning
power.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
a
--
are
we
talking
about
rates
or
are
we
talking
about
the
term
of
the
service?
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
well
--
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
well,
i
think
there
is
some
relief
available
if
--
if
you
want
to
use
the
term
“relief”
to
the
extent
that
the
court
expressed
in
the
catco
decision
under
section
7
(e)
of
the
act,
the
conditioning
power
that
appears
at
the
end
of
7
(e).
that's
in
our
main
brief
at
page
--
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
--
60
--
oh,
at
the
top
page
62.
“the
commission
shall
have
the
power
to
attach
to
the
issuance
of
the
certificate
under
the
exercise
of
the
rights
granted
thereunder.
such
reasonable
terms
and
conditions
as
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
may
require.”
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
oh,
i
think
the
company
could
refuse
the
condition
certificate.
and
i
think
that
was
recognized
in
the
catco
decision.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
recognize
that
the
commission's
conditioning
power
may
extend
so
far
as
to
extend
the
duration
of
--
of
the
term
of
the
contract
or
the
term
of
the
sale.
i
think
its
conditioning
power
there
may
be
limited
by
the
whole
or
any
part
phrase
and
the
--
the
able
and
willing
phrase
of
the
earlier
language
of
section
7
(e).
we
don't
need
to
reach
that
in
this
case
because
of
--
of
the
nature
of
the
certificate
that
was
actually
issued.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
yes,
sir.
and
if
the
--
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
you
say
our
contract
from
--
from
our
point
of
view
would
not
be
outside
the
public
interest?
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
well,
its
power
in
that
respect
is
broad.
i
--
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
it's
very
broad.i
have
difficulty
conceiving.
they're
--
they're
making
that
determination
on
--
on
account
of
too
long
a
term.
i
--
i
can
conceive
of
it
in
the
case
of
too
short
a
term,
perhaps,
six
months
contracts,
one
--
one
year
contracts
were
postulated
here
earlier,
perhaps
that
commission
could
determine
in
its
wisdom
that
that's
not
in
the
public
interest
and
denies
a
certificate
application
on
that
basis.
and
i
concede
that
as
well
within
the
power
commission.
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
[laughs]
mr.
leo
j.
hoffman
this
case
in
mr.
wahrenbrock's
argument
particularly
boils
itself
down
to
this
continuing
service
doctrine
which
is
repeated
time
and
time
again.
that
incorporates
the
theme
that
these
producers
should,
under
no
circumstances,
i
am
generalizing
of
course,
be
permitted
to
quit
their
sale
or
their
service
without
the
approval
of
the
federal
power
commission.
and
otherwise,
the
power
commission
will
be
handicapped.
we
say
that
if
that's
so,
the
commission
should
go
to
congress
and
not
to
this
court
because
that
involves
changing
the
act.
we
only
ask
for
the
same
thing
granted
in
mobile,
a
preservation
of
the
integrity
of
the
contracts
and
the
regulatory
scheme.
thank
you.
