justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
really
the
point
that
the
questions,
the
issues
that
the
subjects
of
mr.
justice
brennan's
questions
have
not
yet
been
reached,
is
it,
and
then
you
don't
know
if
there
any
--
if
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
roberts,
i'm
not
quite
clear
as
to
what
time
of
the
lawsuit
you
suggest
the
petitioner
should
bring.
this
is
--
this
is
the
time
of
the
suit
that
you
--
that
i
understand
that's
been
(inaudible).
this
isn't
an
injunction
against
the
sale
of
property
would
be
appropriate
here
at
all,
would
it,
of
the
properties.
justice
potter
stewart
will
the
stipulation
affect
our
problem
here?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
it
says
if
the
money
were
still
unpaid
by
the
city
of
new
york?
justice
potter
stewart
and
nothing
but
a
notice
of
lien?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
will
the
2410
proceeding
be
brought?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
state
court
of
the
federal
court?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
we
leave
this,
i'm
little
(inaudible)
but
i
don't
quite
understand
the
kind
of
action
that
you're
suggesting
the
petitioner
should
have
brought.
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
declaratory
judgment
action
would
not
be
available
here
if
it
involves
taxation,
is
that
correct?
