justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understand
that
you
derive
your
power
here
from
the
implications
of
2463,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
wonder
if
you
would
make
a
comment
on
the
discussion
of
the
problem
of
summary
recovery
of
that
property
that
is
involved
here
of
the
opinion
in
the
taubel-scott-kitzmiller?
have
you
suggest
--
dealt
with
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
discussion
of
justice
brandeis
in
that
case?
that
--
that
taubel
is
(inaudible)
to
the
general
requirements
of
the
plenary
suits
and
that
the
exception
must
be
manifested
by
--
for
the
specific
legislation
as
i
get
out
of
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
explicitly
that
will
require
to
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
having
in
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
might
claim
it
ex
officio.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean,
he
might
claim
that's
not
stolen
or
the
court
pleaded
that
he
might
say
this
is
a
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
state
keepers
as
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
the
difficulty
of
substitution
--
substitutive
party
that
if
he
resigns,
he
is
fit
to
be
getting
to
an
action
of
where
he
got
to
resigning
their
offices.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
those
are
contested
questions,
aren't
they,
mr.
hart?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
happens
that
maybe
they
clear,
you
maybe
--
he
may
be
extra
zealous
or
he
maybe
extra
careful
or
he
–
you
say
we'll
find
it
out
in
the
--
some
legal
action?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
the
reason
i
put
the
case
to
you
is
because
the
characteristic
detail
in
the
--
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
that
opinion
for
the
court
said
this
if
the
impression
that
you
want
a
good
deal
before
we
will
allow
such
an
action.
now
i'm
not
overstating
the
case,
am
i?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
roberts,
before
you
proceed
with
the
replevin
thought,
would
you
indicate
what
was
embraced,
what
was
accomplished
by
subject
only
to
the
order
to
decrees
of
the
courts
in
dealing
with
the
1833
statute.
what
was
had
in
mind
for
that
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know,
to
what
--
for
what
purposes
that
authorization
if
it
maybe
so
called
was
put
in
subject
only
to
the
orders
and
decrees
of
the
courts
of
the
unites
states
shall
be
accepted,
shall
be
deemed
to
be
on
the
custody
and
subject
only
to
the
order
of
the
--
dedication
arise
under
the
--
before
we
get
to
the
modern
form
of
the
progentive
statute.
to
what
kind
of
situation
was
this
authorization
of
the
--
to
the
court
to
issue
order
and
decree
reference
to
the
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1833?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
your
--
on
your
suppositions
you
in
that
a
prior
judgment
which
is
a
matter
of
committee
ought
to
be
respected
by
the
federal
courts.
the
district
of
--
the
federal
district
court
or
the
circuit
court
would
have
lead
to
let
the
property
go
out
of
its
custody,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
it
couldn't
but
--
i
understand
that,
but
it
could
go
to
the
u.s.c.,
united
states
court
and
ask
that
court
to
release
the
property
within
its
custody,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
thinking
enlightenment.
i
want
to
know
up
to
what
situations
would
be
applicable
the
power
of
the
court
having
a
custody
of
property
not
referable
to
anybody
else
to
what
situation
would
this
empowering
second
half
of
that
sentence
apply
but
shall
be
subject
–
there
is
a
negative
and
there
is
a
positive.
if
it's
in
the
custody
of
property
taken
or
detained
under
any
running
laws
should
not
be
reprievable
but
shall
be
deemed
to
be
in
the
custody
of
the
law
and
subject
--
it
shall
not
be
reprievable.
that's
the
--
that's
the
prohibition.
that's
the
proscription.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there's
an
authorization,
it
shall
be
subject
to
orderly
decree
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
to
what
would
such
an
order,
a
decree
be
directed
of
property
into
the
custody
of
the
united
states
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
do
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
thought
that
would
be
that,
only
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
the
authorization
to
surrender
isn't
qualified
by
anything
in
the
language.
now,
what
is
there
outside
of
the
language
that
we
such
a
gloss
--
put
such
gloss
on
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
afraid
i
can't
make
it
clear.
as
i
read
it,
the
court
can
issue
an
order.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
plenary
or
summary
or
anything
else.
the
court
issues
all
sorts
of
orders,
court
issues,
orders,
petitions
in
the
second
circuit
dealing
with
officers
of
courts.
now,
wherein
is
the
limitation
in
this
statute
to
plenary
orders,
orders
powering
the
plenary
suit
as
against
order
powering
a
summary
suit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
do
you
get
it
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
didn't
say
anything
about
it.
that
merely
says
that
if
the
general
suits
brought
under
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
is
there
a
specific
statute
dealing
with
property,
that
unusual
thing,
property
into
the
custody
of
a
court
and
why
do
we
have
the
inclusive
statute?
i'm
not
saying
it
is.
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
custody
of
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
if
--
if
it
could
be
claimed
on,
that
(inaudible),
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
your
answer
means
that
if
the
--
if
property
were
in
the
custody
of
the
court
and
that
restricted
and
technical
and
intelligible
sense,
then
the
court
couldn't
make
summary
disposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
it
probably
is
in
the
hands
of
the
custody
in
bankruptcy,
in
the
custody
of
law
and
custody
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
there
a
specific
provision
dealing
with
summary
dispositions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
he
must
get
all
that.
i
mean,
in
fact,
the
(inaudible)
there
is
this
right
for
which
the
petitioner
is
contending
in
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
bankruptcy
act.
i
--
is
that
in
a
very
specific
terms?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
before
going
--
when
the
19
--
from
1833
down
to
whatever
it
was
1930,
there
was
no
federal
procedure,
rules
of
federal
procedure,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
was
the
situation?
is
there
any
material
dealing
with
a
cognate
problem
to
the
one
now
before
the
court
under
the
act
of
1833
before
it
became
embodied,
even
the
revised
statutes
or
any
of
u.s.
codes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
third
circuit
read
it
as
unqualified.
my
question
put
it
to
you
is
namely
since
we
have
a
subject
only
for
the
orders
in
decrees
of
the
court,
it
can
issue
any
order
it
pleases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
campbell
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
two.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fifth
circuit
in
what
date?
justice
felix
frankfurter
march
15
or
16?
justice
felix
frankfurter
15.
justice
felix
frankfurter
court
of
appeals?
is
that
at
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
why
else
should
the
federal
--
the
rule
of
federal
civil
procedure,
the
governing
rule
for
that
civil
act,
a
civil
court
be
intimidated
rule
of
the
mayor
of
the
state,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
then
understand
that
the
predecessor
act
of
the
present
1833
statute
that
under
that,
whether
you
could
or
could
not
have
a
summary
proceeding
that
a
petitioner
as
against
the
federal
act
in
such
a
decision
that
(inaudible)
would
have
depended
on
the
local
law
and
so
as
near
as
maybe,
the
nearest
maybe
for
the
government.
because
otherwise,
you
would
have
to
say
that
the
rule
of
civil
procedure
or
--
then
you
would
have
to
say
that
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
introduced
a
limiting
factor
as
to
the
procedure
allowable
under
the
1833
act
insofar
of
any
state
procedures
adopted
by
the
federal
courts
tipping
in
that
state
allows
such
state
procedures,
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
(inaudible)
what
is
the
yes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nearest
maybe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
probable
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
your
answer
is
yes,
it
could've.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
my
question.
what
you're
saying
is
a
hypothetical
question
that
have
no
practical
application?
