mr.
jack
hart
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
by
way
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
question
presented
involves
the
construction
of
a
statute.
the
statute
is
a
short
one,
consisting
of
five
lines
and
is
printed
on
page
one
of
petitioner's
brief.
it's
section
2463
of
the
judicial
code
which
reads
as
follows,
“all
property
taken
or
detained
under
any
revenue
law
of
the
united
states
shall
not
be
repleviable,
but
shall
be
deemed
to
be
in
the
custody
of
the
law
and
subject
only
to
the
orders
and
decrees
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states
having
jurisdiction
thereof."
the
question
presented
is
whether
under
that
statute,
statute
the
district
courts
had
jurisdiction
in
a
summary
proceeding
instituted
by
petitioner
in
order
to
show
cause
to
determine
the
claim
of
a
non-taxpayer
that
his
property
has
been
seized
and
satisfied
the
tax
obligation
of
a
nun.
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
expressly
declining
to
follow
the
third
circuit,
held
that
the
district
courts
had
no
such
jurisdiction
and
dismissed
the
petition.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
in
one
sentence
upon
the
opinion
below.
in
this
court,
the
respondent
suggests
that
the
case
might
be
remanded
to
the
southern
district
without
prejudice
to
the
petitioners
requesting
that
the
court
treat
the
petition
as
a
complaint
and
that
the
action
then
proceed
in
accordance
for
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedures.
that
suggestion
of
course
is
no
concession
at
all
because
in
the
current
posture
of
this
case,
the
major
issue
is
whether
we
are
required
to
proceed
in
accordance
with
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
but
whether
we
have
a
right
would
obtain
the
article
quarters
of
the
court
with
respect
to
the
time
for
answer,
the
time
for
pretrial
proceedings,
the
time
for
trial.
the
facts
in
the
instant
case
maybe
briefly
stated.
the
petitioner,
new
hampshire
fire
insurance
company,
among
other
things,
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
issuing
surety
bonds.
in
1956,
the
petitioner
issued
a
surety
bond
on
behalf
of
a
contractor,
acme
cassa
incorporated
which
had
entered
into
a
contract
of
the
city
of
new
york
for
the
construction
of
a
playground.
during
the
course
of
the
work
which
involved
a
contract
to
delinquent
taxpayer
of
$356,000,
acme
cassa
became
financially
unable
to
continue
with
the
work.
the
city
of
new
york
as
obligee,
thereupon
called
upon
the
petitioner
here
to
complete
the
work
and
pay
the
unpaid
bills
of
acme
cassa.
this,
the
petitioner
did.
in
the
meantime,
acme
cassa
had
become
a
delinquent
taxpayer
and
the
united
states
filed
notices
of
tax
levies
with
the
city
of
new
york.
there
came
a
time
then
when
the
city
of
new
york
had
available
for
payment
some
$68,000
and
this
money
was
in
the
form
of
a
warrant
to
the
order
of
this
petitioner.
at
that
time,
the
petitioner
had
expanded
some
$83,000
in
completing
the
work
and
in
paying
unpaid
bills.
the
government
had
a
tax
lien
in
the
amount
of
some
$35,000.
in
new
york
state,
the
law
is
the
very
well
established
than
in
these
circumstances.
the
surety
is
obligated
to
the
position
of
the
obligee,
in
this
case
the
city,
and
that
therefore,
the
money
is
payable
directly
to
the
surety
and
accordingly
the
government's
tax
lien,
which
applied
only
to
the
property
of
the
anointed
taxpayer
has
no
applicability
of
law
at
all.
plainly,
we
don't
deal
with
the
question
of
priority
because
the
property
never
goes
to
acme
cassa,
the
delinquent
taxpayer.
in
the
district
court,
the
judge
said
that
we
were
required
to
bring
a
plenary
procedure.
nobody
has
said
against
to
whom
we
are
supposed
to
bring
a
plenary
proceeding
and
it
is
submitted
to
this
court
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
ordinary
types
of
case
where
you
have
a
plaintiff
and
defendant.
the
party
difficult
to
pinpoint
in
this
case
is
the
defendant.
the
history
of
the
statute,
its
express
language,
its
evident
purpose
all
make
it
clear
that
this
property
when
improperly
seized
by
a
person
who
happens
to
be
a
tax
collector,
but
who
of
course
is
merely
an
individual
tortfeasor
when
he
seizes
the
property
of
a
non-taxpayer.
that
tax
as
we
say
very
clearly
put
the
property
in
the
custody
of
the
court
subject
to
the
orders
and
decrees
of
that
court.
and
for
that
reason,
what
we
are
engaged
in
doing
here
is
making
an
application
to
the
court
to
return
the
property.
mr.
jack
hart
the
surety
came
in
i
think
after
the
filing
of
the
tax
lien.
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
say
that
the
--
in
our
view,
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
government's
tax
lien
is
of
no
significance.
it
is
of
no
significance
because
we
are
not
concerned
to
the
question
of
priority.
the
contention
is
and
the
law
in
new
york
is
so
well
established
as
not
to
be
in
doubt
that
in
these
circumstances,
the
delinquent
taxpayer
never
gets
the
property
right
to
any
of
the
contract
balances
and
the
money
goes
directly
from
the
city
of
new
york
to
the
surety.
we
therefore
don't
fight
for
money
which
belongs
to
the
delinquent
taxpayer
in
any
sense.
mr.
jack
hart
well,
if
there
are
no
money
would
be
loaned.
we
are
talking
here
about
progress
payments
of
the
--
in
the
usual
way.
there
will
be
a
lump
sum
contract
price
with
prohibitions
or
payments
during
the
progress
of
the
work
as
per
requisitions
made
by
the
contractor
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
a
contract.
if
he
fails
to
perform,
then
obviously
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
get
paid.
essentially,
that
would
be
the
reasoning
behind
which
--
on
the
basis
of
which
came
the
conclusion
that
the
surety
becomes
subrogated
to
the
position
of
the
owner
cutting
out
the
contractor
altogether.
he
had
no
right
to
get
the
money
because
he
failed
to
perform.
mr.
jack
hart
in
this
case,
i
believe
it
did.
i
repeat
that
the
--
the
term
of
the
filing
i
think
everybody
would
recognize,
in
this
case
had
recognized
would
be
insignificant.
the
--
there
has
been
no
issue
raised
about
the
merits
of
this
controversy.
nobody
has
been
required
to
take
a
position
about
the
right
of
the
surety,
but
the
law
in
new
york
is
so
well
established
that
i
don't
think
anybody
would
raise
any
question
about
the
law
being
what
i
have
stated
it
would
be
and
namely
the
very
reason
that
subrogated
for
the
position
of
the
owner.
mr.
jack
hart
yes,
well,
the
--
the
surety
thing
subrogated
for
the
position
of
the
owner
and
its
right
of
subrogation
depending
on
whether
it
has
in
fact
expanded
the
money.
there
are
perhaps
in
some
cases
whether
the
city
under
the
circumstances
would
have
had
the
right
to
whip
all
the
money
from
the
contractor,
and
then
there's
no
doubt
about
that
when
the
contractor
has
failed
to
perform.
there
could
be
questions
of
fact.
for
example,
if
the
surety
had
expended
only
$20,000
and
the
amount
payable
was
$40,000,
its
right
to
subrogation
would
extend
to
the
extent
of
$20,000
and
not
40.
mr.
jack
hart
no,
sir.
the
surety
--
the
issue
hasn't
been
raised.
the
only
issue
raised
in
the
state
is
meant
that
we
are
applied
to
institute
an
action
in
proceeding
by
filing
a
complaint
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
giving
a
defendant
20
days
in
which
to
answer.
mr.
jack
hart
yes.
mr.
jack
hart
there
are
plenary
suits
but
nobody
says
against
whom
and
there
isn't
any
findings
(voice
overlap)
yes.
mr.
jack
hart
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
hart
well,
i
must
say
with
respect
to
that
that
the
respondent
has
not
been
required
to
take
a
position
in
the
posture
of
this
case
as
to
whether
it
concedes,
he
concedes
or
denies
that
the
money
belong
to
the
surety
because
he
had
attacked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
has
not
been
required
to
respond
to
the
factual
allegations
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
jack
hart
it's
actually
so,
mr.
justice
stewart,
yes.
we've
been
dismissed.
now,
2463
has
an
interesting
history
which
i
can
briefly
allude
to.
it
was
first
passed
in
1833
in
response
to
south
carolina
ordinance
of
nullification.
the
south
carolina
didn't
like
the
tariff
act
which
had
been
passed
and
--
passed
some
state
laws,
duty
of
tariff
act
is
--
tariff
act
fact
should
not
apply
in
south
carolina.
congress
then
passed
a
rather
lengthy
statute
making
numerous
provisions
to
deal
with
that
situation
in
south
carolina
and
2463
and
almost
the
exact
words
it
has
today
was
incorporated
in
that
statute.
many
of
the
sections
of
that
statute
and
we
think
on
this
point
as
perhaps
with
some
moneys,
the
respondent
in
its
brief
has
begged
the
question
here
referred
to
what
would
be
the
case
if
tax
collector
acting
properly
under
the
tariff
act
did
what
he
did.
we
think
it's
plain
that
2463
the
section
with
which
we
are
here
dealing
must
be
read
by
including
after
the
second
word
back
in
the
statute
the
additional
word
improper.
section
2463
specifically
deals
only
with
cases
where
a
person
who
happens
to
be
a
district
director
seizes
or
detains
the
property
of
a
non-taxpayer
justifying
his
conduct
on
the
ground
that
he
is
a
district
director,
but
the
revenues
laws
do
not
apply
to
non-taxpayers
and
we
are
dealing
here
i
might
say
in
all
of
you
with
the
case
we
would
have
if
the
district
director
so
seized
the
automobile
of
mr.
a
to
satisfy
the
tax
obligations
of
mr.
b
and
we
are
dealing
now
with
the
question
of
who
gets
possession
of
the
automobile
when
this
dispute
arises
and
whatever
has
been
decided
and
what
are
the
rights
of
mr.
a
with
respect
to
retrieving
his
property?
it
seems
evident
from
that
point
of
view
that
the
district
director
is
not
defending
that
in
the
case
because
unless
we
had
2463,
we
have
difficulty
in
saying
on
what
basis
we
could
get
him
into
a
federal
court.
normally,
there
would
be
no
diversity
present
and
there
was
not
in
present
case.
and
since
the
charge
against
him
is
merely
that
he
is
an
individual
tortfeasee,
the
case
against
him,
whatever
it
happened
to
be,
would
not
arise
under
any
federal
law.
further,
it
seems
clear
that
the
district
director
does
not
claim
that
the
property
is
his.
that's
the
very
last
thing
he
would
claim
and
it
seems
perfectly
plain
that
he
would
not
even
in
his
personal
capacity
contend
that
he
had
a
right
to
the
possession
of
the
property.
for
example,
suppose
that
in
this
case
which
has
now
been
pending
a
year,
mr.
scanlon
had
resigned
from
his
office
as
district
director.
what
would
have
happened
to
the
automobile?
certainly,
he
would
have
not
kept
it.
now
south
carolina,
in
1833,
provided
that
way
a
property
was
seized
by
federal
officials,
the
federal
officials
would
be
guilty
of
a
crime
under
south
carolina
law
and
in
reacting
to
that,
congress
passed
statute
protecting
its
revenue
and
prevent
--
protecting
its
officials
by
providing
there
questions
which
arose
should
be
tried
in
the
federal
courts.
that
was
where
the
seizures
were
made
under
the
revenue
order.
2463
deals
with
the
case
of
what
happens
with
property
seized
when
there
is
no
authority
for
seizing.
where
do
you
put
it?
it
seems
evident
and
we'd
have
no
question,
i
say
in
all
humility,
whether
if
all
we
did
was
read
the
language
at
2463,
it
says
clearly,
“that
property
is
to
be
deemed
to
be
in
the
custody
of
the
law.”
it
seems
to
be
plainly
that
place
to
put.
now,
if
that
is
so,
then
we
don't
have
a
cause
of
action
where
a
plaintiff
and
defendant
proceeding
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
but
to
accept
the
suggestion
made
by
the
respondent's
brief,
we
are
in
fact
applying
to
the
court.
they
say
we
are
really
making
a
motion
rather
than
proceeding
by
petition
and
we
have
no
objection
to
that.
if
an
application
to
a
court
is
a
motion
that
is
what
we
are
doing.
we
are
applying
through
the
court
which
has
the
custody
of
this
property
to
return
it
to
us.
mr.
jack
hart
on
the
basis
of
the
express
language
that
of
section
2463.
mr.
jack
hart
the
several
cases
which
have
dealt
with
this
have
made
no
distinction
between
the
custody
of
the
law
and
the
custody
of
the
courts
--
mr.
jack
hart
--
by
taking
it
–
i
am
sorry,
sir.
taking
it
as
being
ambiguous
and
looking
for
its
meaning,
the
property
would
have
to
be
in
some
place.
we
insist
here
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
director
of
internal
revenue
or
a
tax
collector
or
with
the
united
states.
if
we
have
as
an
adversary
either
the
united
states
or
a
collector
of
internal
revenue,
then
we
have
conceded
we
must
loose.
our
entire
case
is
based
on
the
contention
that
being
an
non
taxpayer,
we
do
not
come
within
the
coverage
of
the
tax
laws
and
that
therefore,
if
somebody
takes
my
property
and
i'm
non
taxpayer,
it
is
interesting
what
should
move
from
his
--
first
thing
into
my
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
burglarizing
the
same
and
then
defending
on
the
ground
that
he
also
happens
to
be
a
district
director.
we
don't
have
that
problem
because
district
director
is
an
honest
man
and
proceeds
with
honest
intentions.
mr.
jack
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
hart
the
court
does
not
get
jurisdiction
over
the
person
of
the
defendant
by
our
filing
a
petition.
due
process
requires
simply
be
notified
just
as
it
requires
in
this
case
the
city
of
new
york
and
the
contractor
to
be
notified.
and
in
one
of
the
interested
parties,
quite
take
a
different
position
on
the
substance
of
our
complaint.
but
as
a
non-taxpayer,
if
we
are
right
and
if
this
posture
of
the
case,
the
allegations
of
our
petition
must
assumed
to
be,
right,
then
it
is
our
property
which
has
been
seized
without
any
warrant,
without
any
judicial
sanction
which
normally
would
permit
us
to
bring
the
tortfeasor
who
happens
to
be
a
district
director
into
a
state
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
wouldn't
seem
to
be
any
basis
for
suing
him
in
a
federal
court.
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
basis
for
the
federal
jurisdiction
to
sue
a
tortfeasor
who
happens
to
be
the
district
director
but
who
has
not
acted
as
an
agent
of
the
united
states.
mr.
jack
hart
no,
sir.
but
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
refer
to
the
ordinary
civil
litigations
and
if
this
were
a
case
where
we're
suing
the
district
director,
then
there
would
be
no
doubt
that
the
federal
rules
would
apply.
mr.
jack
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
hart
no,
sir.
mr.
jack
hart
well,
if
i
may
take
your
very
illustration,
suppose
that
mr.
scanlon
the
district
director
in
this
case
having
seized
our
property
then
resigned,
and
was
no
longer
the
district
director,
who
would
be
the
defendant
in
our
suit.
whom
do
we
sue?
we
have
no
issue
with
the
untied
states
of
america
because
we
now
know
there
are
many
taxes
and
they
don't
claim
that
we
are
delinquent
taxpayer.
we
therefore
have
no
issue
with
the
district
director
because
to
the
extent
that
he
is
the
district
director,
he
is
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority.
if
he
is,
and
then
we
would
concede
that
this
proceeding
could
not
be
sustained.
we
don't
have
a
lawsuit
against
anybody,
but
dealing
with
the
situation
reflected
in
the
statute
passed
for
the
protection
of
the
united
states
in
order
to
balance
out
or
on
the
one
hand,
the
extraordinary
power
of
the
tax
authorities
to
collect
administratively
and
the
right
of
a
decree
non
taxpayer
to
get
his
property
back,
this
statute
says
in
such
a
case
we'll
put
the
property
into
the
custody
of
the
law.
any
privilege
that
the
court
has
and
say
you
have
now
cut
this
property
because
the
statute
puts
it
there
and
we
ask
you
to
return
it
to
us.
who
is
entitled
to
notice
then?
those
people
who
the
due
process
tells
us
who
are
entitled
the
notice.
in
this
case,
the
district
director,
the
city
of
new
york
and
the
contractor,
nobody
else
could
seem
to
have
any
--
the
district
director
as
a
fact
of
the
matter
of
cause
appears
by
the
attorneys
for
the
united
states
america
because
if
he
in
fact
was
a
district
director
or
to
put
it
in
other
way,
if
indeed
he
was
acting
within
the
authority
of
the
tax
laws,
then
of
course
the
property
goes
to
the
united
states
of
america.
but
if
he
was
not
so
doing,
then
the
united
states
has
no
interest
in
this
proceeding,
the
district
director
is
not
involved
and
an
individual
will
happens
to
be
a
district
director
is
given
notice
because
he
is
the
one
who
purported
to
act
under
the
authority
of
a
revenue
law.
the
point
we
submit
is
made
clearer
by
considering
what
we
have
been
relegated
to
do.
we
are
told
to
institute
a
plenary
proceeding.
we
don't
know
what
the
kind
of
judgment
the
court
–
courts
entered
since
we
take
it
a
verdict
that
mr.
scanlon
in
this
case
would
not
claim
that
the
custody
of
this
property
is
in
him
except
as
a
custodian
for
the
court.
the
respondent
suggests
that
custody
of
the
law,
mr.
justice
whittaker
means
that
the
custody
of
the
collector
is
being
protected
against
process
from
other
courts.
protected
to
be
sure
as
long
as
he
is
the
custodian
for
the
district
court
where
the
property
is
located.
for
example,
suppose
that
the
district
director
was
concededly
a
dishonest
person,
and
suppose
then
that
he
had
seized
negotiable
securities
depending
--
warning
to
non
taxpayer
and
suppose
then
that
he
were
directed
to
turn
them
over
by
the
district
court
but
said
no
section
2463
says
that
my
custody
has
been
protected.
undoubtedly,
the
court
does
not
have
physical
custody
of
the
property,
but
we
think
that
it
has
constructive
custody
of
the
property.
we
say
squarely
that
from
the
2463,
we
do
indeed
make
a
motion
to
the
court
in
whose
custody
the
property
was
placed
to
return
it
and
to
return
it
in
summary
fashion,
meaning
by
that
at
the
time
limitation
is
set
forth
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedures
do
not
apply.
and
frankly,
we
are
at
great
difficulty
to
understand
why
the
government
which
is
the
real
party
and
interest
on
the
other
side
should
have
the
slightest
detection
to
this.
we
deal
with
the
question
of
power
and
not
of
discretion.
if
coming-in
in
this
motion
procedure,
it
is
a
term
that
the
government
needs
time
to
ascertain
the
facts
to
present
its
own
no
position,
on
our
theory
and
on
what
we
submit
here
there
is
noting
to
prevent
the
district
judge
from
saying
in
my
discretion,
i
(inaudible)
that
this,
the
respondent
shall
have
20
days
in
which
no
answer
or
two
months
in
which
to
conduct
these
oral
depositions.
there's
nothing
to
prevent
that,
but
if
the
money
belongs
to
the
treasury,
then
one
would
think,
it
ought
to
be
covered
in
(inaudible)
and
that
the
government
should
be
happy
to
have
the
opportunity
to
accomplish
that.
if
not,
then
as
often
happens,
delays
occur
which
sometimes
result
in
a
denial
of
justice.
mr.
jack
hart
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
hart
well,
i
--
mr.
jack
hart
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
would
say
that
we
are
submitting
to
this
court
that
the
history
of
2463
--
mr.
jack
hart
expressed
language.
mr.
jack
hart
we'll
--
we'll
put
together
leave
no
alternatives
in
logic
to
what
we
are
here
submit.
there
is
no
deferment
for
us
to
sue.
nobody
has
this
property
if
the
court
hasn't
got
it
and
in
an
appropriate
case,
the
district
director,
if
not
a
tortfeasor,
well,
if
not
a
civil
tortfeasor,
if
he
is
going
to
keep
the
property
and
insist
that
he
has
a
proprietary
interest
in
it,
it
might
approach
a
criminal
situation.
he
doesn't
claim
it.
the
united
states
doesn't
claim
it.
the
dispute
--
mr.
jack
hart
well,
if
he
claims
it
as
ex
officio,
if
i
--
if
i
get
the
solution
--
mr.
jack
hart
exactly
so.
mr.
jack
hart
yes,
we're
not
personally.
what
happens
if
he
resigns,
what
happens
to
the
property?
what
does
he
doing?
now,
where
is
his
obligation
set
forth?
mr.
jack
hart
well,
the
district
director
has
a
pretty
powerful
weapon
in
being
able
to
proceed
administratively
to
seize
property.
he
is
entitled
to
have
it,
but
it
is
fraught
with
these
and
if
he
seizes
property
which
a
citizen
claims
was
improperly
seized
because
i
am
not
a
taxpayer,
then
it
hardly
seem
to
depend
--
mr.
jack
hart
oh,
yes.
mr.
jack
hart
they
--
they
may
will
be
sir
contested
questions
and
power
before
us
is
if
they
are
contested
which
we
assume
they
are,
how
are
you
trying
to
manage?
mr.
jack
hart
no,
sir
and
i
would
agree
with
that
and
i
say
we
have
a
good
deal
present.
indeed
we
can
hardly
--
we
think
an
alternative
is
not
available.
thank
you.
