justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
hart,
as
of
what
date
in
reference
to
the
filing
of
the
federal
tax
lien
did
the
surety
as
you
put
it,
definitely
(inaudible)
of
the
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
the
--
if
that
time
of
the
filing
of
the
federal
tax
liens
that
you
had
not
yet
stepped
in
use
of
a
contract,
to
whom
did
the
city
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
tax
liens
owed
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
(inaudible)
also
arise
after
the
filing
of
the
tax
liens?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
you
mean
this
case
comes
to
us,
virtually
you
and
the
government
and
the
other
side
in
agreement
that
the
property
did
belong
to
the
surety
at
the
time
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
right
such
issue
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
even
on
the
premise
that
in
fact
that
the
contractor's
business
--
no
property
of
the
contractor
but
only
the
surety
code.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
on
that
premise
the
--
should
you
civilly
suit
by
rather
than
summary
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
the
contention
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
it's
your
money,
you
can't
resort
and
no
claim
belongs
to
the
contractor.
you
can't
resort
to
the
summary
procedure
but
must
institute
some
kind
of
plenary
suit
against
somebody.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
number?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
roberts,
is
there
some
particular
reason
why
the
government's
is
insistent
on
a
plenary
suit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
discovery,
is
that
something
--
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
civil
rules
that
you're
particularly
interested
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
could
not
the
trial
judge
and
appropriate
representations
make
any
act
applicable
in
the
summary
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
just
an
--
your
insistence
is
a
practical
one
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
no
other
presents
the
best
side
of
the
government's
claim
if
there
is
any
at
all,
you
have
to
have
the
advantages
under
the
rules
of
the
time
limitation
of
discovering
and
the
rest
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
fact
here
is,
the
money
--
not
money
but
the
obligation
has
not
yet
been
paid
by
the
city
of
new
york,
anyway.
that's
--
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
actually
the
collector
has
nothing
except
a
notice
of
lien
filed
with
the
city
of
new
york,
i
guess.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
i
--
there
has
been
some
stipulation
that
the
money
has
been
paid
and
the
bonds
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
notice
of
levy
by
the
collector?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
against
the
collector
as
a
--
as
a
non
official
of
the
united
states
under
the
definition
of
official
of
united
states,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
2410?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
if
the
government
came
in
with
the
kind
of
story
you've
just
given
us
is
the
reason
you
want
under
the
summary
judgment
section
itself,
there
is
authority
in
the
court
to
allow
the
recovery
even.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
right
--
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
would
get
them
anyway?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
you've
indicated
that
if
you
could
find
out,
you
might
find
through
our
facts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suggest
you
could
do
that
under
the
provision
dealing
with
summary
judgment
now.
it
would
get
very
far
if
you
were
to
make
a
kind
of
representation
to
the
trial
judge
that
you
make
us
but
you've
got
to
find
out
what
the
respected
dates
are
on
the
lien
that
was
filed
in
relation
to
when
the
surety
stepped
in
the
shoes,
the
contact
and
all
those
things.
there
is
a
provision
on
the
summary
judgment
procedures
i
understand
it,
the
discovery
and
those
kind
of
things.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
not
be
available.
what
would
--
what
kind
of
an
injunction
here
--
who
are
you
trying
to
enjoin?
this
--
this
man
doesn't
have
any
money,
the
defendant,
the
collector,
does
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can't
blame
the
city
of
new
york.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
same
fund.
no
--
no
suggestion
on
the
part
of
the
city
i
take
it
to
bring
little
(inaudible)
