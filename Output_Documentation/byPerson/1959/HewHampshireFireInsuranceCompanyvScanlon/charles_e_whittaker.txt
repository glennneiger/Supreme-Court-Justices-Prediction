justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
on
what
basis
you
assert
that
the
court
had
custody
of
this
property?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
read
it
to
say
that
the
property
should
be
in
the
custody
of
the
law.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you're
seeking
an
adjudication
that
you're
not
a
taxpayer
and
that
the
funds
here
being
held
are
your
funds
and
it
was
being
held
to
the
tax
debt
to
somebody
else
improperly.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
how
do
you
buy
writing
a
letter
to
the
court
or
file
a
motion
with
the
court
initiate
proceedings
that
result
in
the
court's
acquisition
of
jurisdiction
over
the
person
of
the
defendant?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
do
--
tell
me,
do
the
federal
rules
allow
the
initiation
of
a
proceeding
against
a
defendant
and
the
requirement
of
his
return
and
answer
otherwise
and
upon
20
days
allowed
for
the
rules?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
if
there
were
jurisdictions
over
some
raised
or
some
already
pending
case
in
the
court,
then
any
notice
in
the
form
--
reasonable
notice
to
some
other
person
in
an
ancillary
or
a
dependent
proceeding
would
that
court
in
due
process
would
be
sufficient
to
bring
that
person
in,
wouldn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
what
is
in
this
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
understand.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
all
that's
involved
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
plenary
or
summary.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
aren't
you
talking
about
matters
here
that
relate
to
the
merits
when
your
question
is
wholly
and
solely
whether
or
not
you
are
in
the
court
on
the
plenary
suit?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
under
what
procedure
--
under
what
circumstances
is
it
your
idea
that
summary
process
may
issue,
may
have
issue
only
in
an
ancillary
or
a
dependent
manner
or
may
issue
as
the
institution
of
a
new
or
fresh
lawsuit
in
a
federal
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
but
you
had
in
that
case
to
bring
the
(inaudible)
into
court,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
under
the
writ?
