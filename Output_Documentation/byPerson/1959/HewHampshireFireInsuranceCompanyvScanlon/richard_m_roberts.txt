mr.
richard
m.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
case
is
essentially
a
case
presenting
the
question
of
a
procedure
to
be
followed
where
a
district
director
has
allegedly
seized
property
(inaudible)
to
a
non
taxpayer,
that
is
non
taxpayer
foreign
to
the
assessment
that
he
is
trying
to
collect.
rule
one
of
federal
rules
of
civil
procedures
provides
that
these
rules
govern
the
procedure
in
the
united
states
district
courts
in
all
suits
of
a
civil
nature
where
the
cognizance
is
always
cases
at
law
or
in
equity
with
the
exception
stated
in
rule
81.
as
i
understand
it,
there's
no
allegation
here
that
the
exceptions
of
rule
81
are
applicable.
rule
2
provides
that
there
shall
be
one
form
of
action
to
be
known
as
a
civil
action.
now,
if
a
party
believes
that
the
civil
action
that
he
has
brought
is
too
slow
to
give
him
an
adequate
remedy,
he
has
other
proceedings
under
the
rules
that
he
may
take.
he
may
under
rule
65
of
the
same
injunctive
relief
that
the
case
should
more
consider
that
facts
that
were
presented
to
the
court
warrant
and
show
that
relief.
if
he
feels
that
there's
honestly
no
issue
of
fact
as
the
petitioner
feels
here,
then
after
the
expiration
of
20
days
from
the
filing
of
his
compliant,
he
may
move
for
summary
judgment.
now,
as
the
court
well
knows,
prior
to
the
formulation
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedures,
the
procedures
that
were
followed
in
the
district
court
were
to
say
the
least
un-uniform.
a
litigant
might
be
thrown
out
because
he
did
not
complied
with
certain
rules
of
procedure
adopted
in
that
particular
state
in
which
the
district
court
happens
to
be
sitting.
now,
we
submit
that
there's
no
reason
to
favor
under
the
rules
a
person
in
the
position
of
this
petition
who
is
in
effect
getting
his
day
in
the
court
advanced
over
another
litigant
who
is
claiming
possibly
in
a
conversion
case
that
someone
has
this
money
illegal
and
by
making
that
litigant
take
his
normal
day
in
the
court
by
allowing
this
litigant
come
in
and
move
ahead
by
a
show
cause
order
is
disrupting
what
we
feel
to
be
the
purpose
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
was
to
provide
a
uniform
procedure
of
the
federal
district
courts.
now,
section
2463
is
almost
a
verbatim
reenactment
of
the
parts
of
section
2
of
the
act
of
march
2,
1833
which
as
petitioner's
counsel
pointed
out
was
an
act
to
--
to
get
around
the
nullification
ordinance
that
south
carolina
had
enacted.
now
petitioner's
counsel
would
have
the
court
read
into
the
provisions
of
that
section
as
well
as
the
section
as
it
now
stands
properly
--
property
illegally
seized.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
warrant
reading
into
the
present
--
the
predecessor
for
the
present
statute
that
turns
the
very
purpose
of
the
act
of
1883
or
1833,
rather
of
1833,
was
to
retain
in
the
district
director
custody
of
property
that
he
had
legally
seized
for
duties
that
were
attachable
to
property
being
imported
into
the
united
states.
the
state
of
south
carolina
by
its
nullification
ordinance,
a
decree
that
such
duties
were
illegal,
yes,
but
they
were
not
illegal
and
they
were
legally
seized
properties
that
were
seized
to
pay
those
duties.
the
state
of
south
carolina
didn't
like
that
and
it
passed
this
nullification
ordinance
which
would
allow
certain
acts
to
be
done.
one,
it
allowed
for
replugging
to
be
applicable.
it
would
take
the
possession
of
his
property
that
had
been
seized
by
the
collector
out
of
his
hands.
it
made
him
subject
to
a
penalty
of
twice
the
value
of
whatever
property
he
had
taken.
now,
we
submit
that
there's
no
reason
to
read
into
that
section,
the
phrase
that
he
now
requests
to
be
read
in
there
that
it
only
applicable
to
the
property
that
was
illegally
seized.
we
feel
that
it
is
applicable
to
all
property.
now,
even
though
this
property
by
that
section
is
made
subject
to
the
orders
of
the
district
court
and
decrees
to
the
district
court,
it
provided
that
the
property
shall
be
very
irreparable.
now,
the
writ
of
replevin
would
only
test
possessions.
it
wouldn't
test
owner
--
ownership
to
property,
but
now
instead
of
the
writ
of
replevin
being
applicable,
petitioner
would
have
you
hold
that
you
can
go
in
on
a
summary
proceeding
and
determine
title
to
property
whereas
congress
had
said
the
district
courts
could
not
entertain
a
writ
of
replevin.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice?
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i
believe
that
it
would
have
reference
to
the
case
where
prior
to
this
time.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
prior
to
the
time
of
the
enacting
of
this
section.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
in
1833.
if
another
court,
say
a
state
court
had
taken
jurisdiction
could
envision
a
writ
of
attachment
prior
to
judgment
that
this
means
that
it
should
only
be
the
subject
to
the
orders
of
the
district
court
but
no
court
would
have
any
power
to
enter
a
decree
or
order
affecting
this
property
that
had
been
seized
by
the
then
collector
of
revenue.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
collector
of
the
custodies.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
no.
i
don't
believe
that
the
property
had
been
seized
after
this
act
that
any
state
court
couldn't
have
any
order.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i
don't
understand
that
the
--
that
should
go
to
the
state
court
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
it
would
be
recited
this
would
give,
this
district
court
jurisdiction
over
this
property.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
to
order
a
return
to
the
petitioner,
if
it's
rightfully
his
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
now,
that's
what
he
is
asking.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
but
we
say
we
should
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
no,
it
does
not.
but
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
authority
for
the
court
to
have
some
rejurisdiction.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
statute.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
from
rules
of
civil
procedure,
your
honor,
that
authorizing
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i
don't
believe
it
is
property
in
the
custody
of
the
court.
it's
subject
to
the
orders
of
the
court
in
custody
of
the
law.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
but
not
in
custody
of
the
court,
your
honor.
if
it
were
in
custody
of
the
court
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
no,
i
do
not
mean
that,
your
honor.
i
mean
that
it's
not
in
the
custody
of
the
court
for
this
reason.
if
it
were,
then
the
district
director
could
do
nothing
with
that
property
without
going
to
the
court
and
getting
a
court
order
where
he
had
legally
seized
the
property.
if
this
section
puts
it
in
the
custody
of
the
court,
then
he
cannot
take
that
property
and
apply
it
to
the
taxpayer's
taxes
or
sell
it
in
the
pry
of
the
closed
proceeds
to
the
taxpayer's
taxes
because
if
it's
in
the
custody
of
the
court
by
the
very
nature
of
the
term,
the
court
is
the
only
power
that
can
dispose
of
that
property
and
deal
with
that
property.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
if
it's
in
the
custody
of
the
court,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
leave
us
in
the
custody
of
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
but
he
must
--
but
he
must
go
to
the
court
and
get
approval
to
self.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
by
the
bankruptcy
act
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i'm
afraid
i
cannot
answer
that,
your
honor.
it
has
certain
specific
terms,
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
this
case
is
--
the
raffaele
case
in
the
third
circuit
that
uses
this
section
of
the
code
as
giving
the
court
jurisdiction,
in
giving
it
custody
in
the
court
subject
to
the
summary
orders
of
the
court.
that's
the
first
time
in
over
a
hundred
years
that
the
court
had
found
that
that
section
gave
a
jurisdiction
for
this
problem.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
sir.
that
case
was
presented
on
the
injunction
basis
however
and
the
petitioner
here
is
asked
who
he
would
sue
upon
a
reaction.
the
government
concedes
that
he
may
sue
the
district
director
and
i
would
like
to
read
from
a
recent
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
dated
march
15,
1960,
campbell
and
usry.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
campbell
and
usry,
u-s-r-y,
there
are
two
district
directors.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
versus
bagley,
b-a-g-l-e-y,
number
17854.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
fifth
circuit
date
march
15,
1960.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
15.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
1960.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that's
the
circuit
court
of
the
appeals
in
which
they
state
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
number
17854
in
which
they
state
as
to
the
first
proposition
this
court
has
recently
said,
quote,
and
they
are
quoting
from
the
previous
opinion
of
this,
there
is
no
longer
any
doubt
but
what
where
a
district
director
of
internal
revenue
has
levied
upon
the
property
belonging
to
one
person
in
order
to
satisfy
the
tax
liability
of
another,
the
true
owner
may
obtain
from
the
u.s.
district
court
an
injunction
against
the
district
director
to
prevent
the
sale
of
such
property
and
that
if
the
owner
is
not
the
taxpayer
involved,
such
relief
is
not
prohibited
by
26
u.s.c.a
7421.
now,
the
government
admits
that
this
is
outside
the
prohibition
contained
in
the
revenue
code
section
7421
which
prohibits
injunction
suits
to
restrain
the
collection
or
the
assessment
of
taxes.
we
concede
that
where
we
are
grabbing
another
person's
property
that
injunctive
relief
is
properly
granted
against
the
district
director.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
under
the
general
equity
powers
of
the
court,
your
honor.
the
section
prohibits
injunctions
but
we
say
that
the
internal
revenue
code
only
applies
to
taxpayers.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
we
concede
to
that.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
maule
which
â€“
where
the
case
they
were
discussing
from
maule
industries
inc,
that's
the
case
they
were
holding
from
in
this
opinion.
they
point
out
that
the
revenue
code
only
applies
to
taxpayers
and
that
the
prohibition
contained
in
the
revenue
code
against
the
injunctive
relief
would
only
apply
to
one
in
the
position
of
a
taxpayer
and
would
not
apply
to
one
in
the
petitioner's
position
here
where
he
says
he
is
not
the
taxpayer
whose
money
we're
attempting
to
take.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
maul,
m-a-u-l
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
fifth
circuit.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
fifth
circuit
case
is
campbell
and
usry,
u-s-r-y
versus
bagley,
b-a-g-l-e-y.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
your
honor,
yes.
while
we
admit
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
that
the
new
york
law
is
well
settled,
that
the
property
that
is
being
levied
upon
or
at
least
that
the
city
says
we've
levied
upon
is
the
property
of
this
taxpayer.
we
also
want
to
get
the
facts
of
just
what
like
when
did
the
breach
of
the
contract
occur?
what
payments
were
there
made
before
or
after
the
filing
the
notice
of
leave?
now,
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
recognized
that
when
you're
dealing
with
the
government
that
the
government
does
not
and
cannot
act
as
fast
as
the
normal
litigant.
the
federal
rules
gives
the
government
60
days
to
answer
whereas
the
normal
litigant
gets
20
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
this
defendant
here
would
get
60
days
rather
than
20
days
to
act
because
a
provision
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
makes
--
one
of
the
rules
makes
a
district
director,
former
district
director
a
officer
of
the
court
within
the
term
of
that
phrase
in
the
rules
giving
the
not
also
court
of
the
--
also
the
united
states
within
the
rules
giving
that
person
60
days
to
answer.
it
also
recognizes
upon
appeal.
the
government
has
60
days
to
know
note
appeal
whereas
the
time
could
try
litigants
was
less.
we
say
we
are
entitled
to
the
time
that
the
rules
give
us
in
the
case
of
this
sort.
to
get
the
facts
together,
if
a
summary
proceeding
could
be
handled
on
24
hours
notice,
there
would
be
no
rules
applicable
whatsoever.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
discovery,
any
rule
that
would
--
yes,
discovery
to
get
us
the
facts
that
wouldn't
be
applicable
in
the
summary
proceeding
if
unless
the
rest
of
the
rules
are
applicable.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
you
could
at
his
discretion
but
if
i
understand
the
petitioner's
position
is,
he
doesn't
have
to
make
any
of
them
applicable
and
that
he
can
disregard
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
in
a
case
like
this.
now,
we
would
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that's
all
we're
asking.
yes,
your
honor
and
as
we
do,
we're
entitled
to.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
the
injunct
--
is
not
against
the
sale.
no,
your
honor.
but
injunction
suits
have
been
issued
to
border
the
return
of
money.
now
as
to
the
appropriate
proceeding
that
he
should
bring,
the
different
courts
vary
on
what
they
recognize.
the
ninth
circuit
has
recognized
that
you
could
bring
a
2410
proceeding
in
this
type
instance,
in
the
case
you've
just
had
whether
claiming
the
lead.
almost
in
fact
went
barely
before
a
levy
has
served,
a
notice
of
lien
is
filed
so
that
the
government
would
be
claiming
the
liens.
the
ninth
circuit
has
also
upheld
the
use
of
a
civil
proceeding
against
the
district
director
for
a
money
judgment
in
the
tight
situation
where
the
money
has
been
paid
over
already
covered
into
the
treasury.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
correct.
so
that
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
when
he
was
paid
into
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
(inaudible)
above
our
liens
has
been
paid
out
which
is
really
what
was
the
alternative
prayer
relief
in
this
case,
the
alternative
prayer
relief.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
no.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
notice
of
lien
filed
notice
of
levy
served
on
the
session.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
by
the
collector
served
on
the
city.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
where
would
it
be
brought?
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
federal
court.
(voice
overlap)
only
court
that
would
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
frankly,
it
could
be
brought
against
the
united
states.
i
beg
your
pardon,
it
would
have
to
be
brought
against
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
under
2410.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
if
he
feels
there
is
no
issue
of
fact
as
he
does
from
his
statement
of
new
york
law
that
he
is
entitled
to
this
money
he
could
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
but
then
20
days
after
the
commencement
of
his
action
although
bit
inconsistent,
the
rules
are
there
giving
a
60
days
answer
with
allowing
motion
for
summary
judgment
within
20
days
but
he
could
do
it.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
if
it
would
be
on
a
legal
issue
there
your
honor,
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
he
--
he
would
be
with
no
facts
and
dispute.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
correct.
and
i
think
we're
entitled
to
find
out
whether
there
are
facts
and
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
correct.
we
would
be
entitled
to
this
discovery
there
too.
but
if
i
understand
correctly,
the
district
court
would
have
the
discretion
even
in
the
summary
proceedings
to
allow
us
discovery,
but
it
will
only
be
discretion
with
the
district
court.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
would
not
be,
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
no,
they
are
mandatory
injunctions,
they
lift
the
notice
of
levy.
if
that's
proper,
i
would
be
alarmed
about
it
as
to
what
we
have
done
here
actually.
the
notice
of
levy
doesn't
ask
that
the
property
of
the
new
hampshire
fire
insurance
company
be
paid
to
the
united
states.
the
notice
of
levy
is
a
simple
piece
of
paper.
it
sets
out
the
name
of
the
taxpayer
the
amount
of
taxes
that
are
owed
and
the
cause
of
tension
to
the
party
who
is
served
upon
the
fund
and
we're
demanding
from
them
all
property
of
the
taxpayer
and
any
rights
to
property
that
the
taxpayer
may
have.
it
was
the
conservativeness
of
the
city
of
new
york
that
caused
the
petitioner
here
not
to
get
his
money.
it
wasn't
really
the
action
of
the
district
director
in
filing
the
notice
of
levy.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
of
course.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
they
could
do
that
and
our
procedure
is
to
move
to
dismiss
because
there
has
been
no
grant
of
jurisdiction,
no
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
can
intervene
in
a
case
in
which
the
district
director
feels
that
there
is
any
title
or
property
of
the
taxpayer
involved.
now
here
from
the
opinion
of
judge
cashing
in
the
record,
there
is
more
money
owed
to
this
taxpayer
than
the
petitioner
claims.
so
the
levy
is
valid.
that's
one
reason
why
we
don't
--
would
not
want
the
levy
quashed.
the
levy
is
valid
to
a
certain
amount,
to
whatever
the
city
has,
it
belongs
to
this
taxpayer,
our
notice
of
levy
is
valid.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
because
of
that,
we
say
there's
no
reason
to
read
in
to
this
statute
any
exception.
now,
we're
not
--
we
don't
want
to
tell
the
court
that
never
could
there
be
a
summary
proceeding
of
property
deemed
in
the
custody
of
the
court.
if
it's
deemed
to
be
in
the
custody
of
the
court
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
we
say
it's
an
ancillary
and
dependent
matter,
your
honor
and
that
it
held
by
the
third
circuit
in
raffaele
that
this
section
gave
the
district
courts
jurisdiction
to
summarily
determine
rights
of
the
property
that
the
courts
inconsistently
in
the
cases
cited,
has
consistently
found
that
the
action
was
a
dependent
action,
it
wasn't
a
independent
action.
it
was
an
auxiliary
and
dependent
action
for
the
return
of
property.
and
it
wasn't
until
the
third
circuit
in
raffaele
saying
that
--
they
said
any
court
said
should
the
court
could
summarily
determine
property
rights
and
rights
to
property
under
this
section
of
the
code.
we
submit
that
the
circuit
court
and
the
lower
court
were
correct
in
this
case
and
that
they
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
accepting
the
conclusion
that
the
state
court
would
have
had
summary
jurisdiction
over
property,
yes
your
honor.
i
can
think
of
no
proceeding
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
you
asked
me
as
i
understood
your
question,
prior
to
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
the
district
court
would
have
adopted
whatever
procedure
had
been
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
and
if
the
state
court
had
allowed
a
summary
proceeding
to
determine
property
rights,
then
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
and
what
we're
saying
then
is
that
the
rules
would
cut
down
on
that
right
to
a
litigant.
as
i
understand,
that
was
your
question.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
it
is
yes
if
you
--
if
your
assumption
is
correct
that
a
state
court
had
summary
power
over
property,
i
don't
know
if
any
proceeding
where
the
state
court
has
summary
power
over
property
that
is
not
considered
in
the
custody
of
the
court.
it
did
under
the
old
--
under
the
writ
of
replevin.
it
could
determine
possession,
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
that
was
only
possession,
your
honor
and
not
title.
you
still
had
the
plenary
action
to
determine
the
title.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
as
i
understand
the
law,
it
would
have
none,
yes
your
honor.
