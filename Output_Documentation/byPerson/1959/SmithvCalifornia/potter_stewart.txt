justice

stewart
that
was
the
roth.
justice
potter
stewart
now
of
course
alberts,
the
solicitor
general
wasn't
directly
concerned
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
state
of
california?
justice
potter
stewart
and
only
one
member
of
the
court
drew
a
distinction.
justice
potter
stewart
by
films
do
you
mean
generally
released
moving
pictures
that
which
meant
by
films?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
wandered
what
you
meant
by
the
word,
films.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
anything
in
record
that
show
what
was
the
nature
of
thousands
of
other
books?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
california
law
of
the
defendant
could
have
been
tried
by
a
jury
in
this
case,
had
he
not
waived,
could
he?
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
wave
the
trial
by
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
to
which
he
would
have
had
--
justice
potter
stewart
under
your
view
a
man
who
couldn't
read
could
sell
anything
with
impunity
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
now
this
what
we
have
here
is
an
ordinance
of
the
municipality
of
los
angeles?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
this
california
state
statute
is
differently
worded
and
does
require
scienter,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
doesn't
require,
does
it,
that
the
state
prove
all
these
things
you're
telling
me?
justice
potter
stewart
would
it
be
enough
--
would
it
be
enough
under
the
state's
statute
if
the
seller
or
the
bookseller
was
put
on
notice
that
there
was
a
claim
by
the
prosecuting
officials
that
the
book
was
obscene?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
under
the
state
statute
it
would
be
incumbent
on
the
prosecuting
officials
to
give
notice
to
the
bookseller
that
this
book
of
mr.
smith
in
our
judgment
is
obscene
and
unless
you
get
it
off
your
shelf
we'll
have
to
prosecute
you.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
enough,
is
it
not,
or
is
it,
to
give
him
knowledge
--
guilty
knowledge
of
the
same
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
connecticut
decision
you
would
agree.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
did
the
prosecuting
officials
had
an
option
to
proceed
under
the
ordinance
or
under
the
state
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
differ
on
your
construction
of
the
ordinance,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you
concede
that
it
does
not
require
any
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
the
book.
justice
potter
stewart
now
that
would
be
--
that
language
will
be
quite
relevant
if
here
--
they
were
showing
that
mr.
smith
knew
the
contents
of
the
book
and
then
went
ahead
and
took
his
chances
on
a
prosecution
after
knowing
it,
but
is
that
relevant
to
the
man
who
doesn't
know
what's
inside
the
covers
of
the
book?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
state
free
speech
is
distinguishable
from
commercial
activities,
sometimes
it
may
involve
a
non-commercial
activity
and
all
kinds
(inaudible)
commercial
activities.
newspapers
are
published
among
other
purposes
to
make
money.
justice
potter
stewart
does
a
free
speech
in
--
involve
arguably
at
least
something
more
than
the
right
of
the
person
to
speak.
doesn't
involve
--
doesn't
it
involve
the
right
of
other
people
hear
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
a
case
like
burstyn
against
wilson,
copyrighting
of
movies
in
effect?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
what
--
what
i
see
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
think
what
you're
overlooking
is,
among
other
things
is
that
fourteenth
amendment
protects
liberty
as
well
as
property.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
difference
in
test
of
obscenity
between
the
state
law
and
the
los
angeles
ordinance?
