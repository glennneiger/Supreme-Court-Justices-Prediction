mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
appellant
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
was
convicted
and
given
a
30-day
jail
term
for
the
possession
in
his
bookstore
of
a
hard
covered
book
entitled,
“sweeter
than
life.”
the
facts
are
undisputed.
there's
no
question,
but
that
mr.
smith
owned
the
store
and
the
book
was,
in
fact,
in
the
store.
the
courts
below,
if
the
court
please,
found
that
the
book
was
obscene
and
being
obscene,
there
were
no
first
amendment
constitutional
questions
arising
out
of
the
fact
that
he
was
being
punished
for
the
possession
of
a
book.
the
courts
below
also
took
the
position
that
the
appellant
had
no
right
to
introduce
any
evidence
on
the
questions
of
"contemporary
community
standards"
on
what
was
being
read
generally,
what
was
in
bookstores
generally
and,
what
was
the
standards
of
the
community
concerning
the
discussion
of
sex
in
general
and
that
similarly
the
impact
of
the
book
on
average
person
was
of
no
concern.
the
court
said
that
if
the
trial
court,
the
appellate
court
that
is
say,
said
that
if
the
trial
court
had
used
a
standard
that
was
less
than
what
this
court
set
forth
in
roth-alberts,
it
did
not
matter,
that
the
states
were
free
to
set
a
different
standard,
one
which
would
reach
more
books.
and
finally,
the
court
held
that
it
was
proper
for
the
municipality
to
take
out
all
scienter
that
a
bookseller
could,
without
offending
the
constitution,
be
found
guilty
even
though
he
had
not
read
the
book
and
even
though
he
had
no
notice
of
any
kind
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
the
book.
my
colleague,
mr.
rosenwein,
will
discuss
all
of
the
problems
arising
out
of
the
statute
in
terms
of
the
elimination
of
scienter,
and
i
will
discuss
all
of
the
problems
concerning
the
book
itself,
that
would
be
points
two,
three,
and
four
in
our
brief.
our
first
point
is
that
the
book,
“sweeter
than
life”,
simply
is
not
obscene.
to
put
it
the
other
way
that
it
is
not
the
kind
of
a
book
that
the
states
or
the
federal
government
can
suppress
or
can
punish
a
person
for
the
possession
of
it
without
doing
serious
violence
to
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
we
start,
of
course,
with
the
roth-alberts
decision
and
while
much
that
the
court
said
there
was
foreshadowed
by
prior
decisions
i
think
there
were
two
things
that
were
done
which
were
important
and
which
afforded
a
great
deal
of
protection
or
should
have
afforded
a
great
deal
of
protection
to
all
literature
concerning
with
sex.
the
first
thing
that
the
court
did
was
to
say,
and
for
the
first
time
i
believe,
that
sex
and
obscenity
were
not
synonymous.
that
sex
was
an
important
subject
matter
fully
entitled
to
all
of
the
protection
that
you
would
have
if
you
were
discussing
politics,
religion,
or
labor
relations.
now
this,
if
the
court
please,
was
a
big
step
forward
because
the
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
theretofore,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
term,
“dirt
for
dirt's
sake”
was
equated
by
the
trial
court
with
the
expression,
“sex
for
its
own
sake.”
that
you
couldn't
discuss
sex
for
its
own
sake,
it
had
to
be
enmeshed
with
other
things.
you
had
to
justify
it.
for
example,
in
the
times
film
case
which
your
honors
had
just
recently,
the
city
of
chicago,
tried
to
suppress
the
film,
“game
of
love”
under
a
stand
which
says
that
if
the
purpose
of
the
book
was
to
arouse
sexual
desires,
it
was
obscene
unless
it
had
sufficient
merit,
unless
it
had
compensating
value.”
now
in
alberts,
it
was
put
forward
that
we
didn't
have
to
justify
the
writing
about
sex.
that
sex
was
not
obscenity.
that
you
could
talk
about
sex
without
having
to
say,
“we
want
to
wrap
it
up
in
another
package.
we
didn't
have
to
justify
it.
and
this
we
think
is
the
first
important
step
forward
and
the
second
thing
that
this
court
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
i
hope
it's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
it
depends
on
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
can
fairly
look
at
the
body
of
obscenity
laws
that
existed
before
roth-alberts
without
recognizing
that
most
courts
took
the
position
that
the
discussion
of
sex
was
something
to
be
discouraged,
and
suspect.
and
that
unless
you
could
say,
“yes,
it
has
sex
but
it's
justifiable
because
of
the
other
notions
there
that
a
person
with
such
a
book
was
in
trouble.”
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
this
was
part
of
what
our
problem
was
in
roth-alberts.
we
were
saying
just
that
your
honor.
we
were
saying
that
too
many
books
were
under
two
bigger
clouds.
but
we
put
that
to
a
side
in
any
event.
now
this
court
did
say
and
i
think
for
the
first
time,
that
sex
and
obscenity
were
not
synonymous
and
then
to
emphasize
the
first
amendment
aspect
involved
in
any
writing
whether
it'd
be
it
by
way
of
novel
or
educational
work
for
material
dealing
with
sex.
and
the
second
one
is
to
say,
that
no
book
dealing
with
sex
could
there
--
hereafter,
be
found
to
be
obscene
unless
it
went
beyond
contemporary
community
standards
and
appealed
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
average
normal
person
considering
the
book
as
a
whole.
and
this
court
again
in
terms
of
showing
the
narrowness
of
the
new
rule
as
the
court
understood,
it
said
the
door
could
be
opened
only
the
slightest
crack
for
any
federal
or
state
intrusion
into
this
field.
it
couldn't
be
left
ajar
and
then
in
a
series
of
papers
shortly
after
roth-alberts,
this
court
gave
depth
and
width
to
the
rulings
in
roth-alberts.
there
was
a
(inaudible)
case
dealing
with
the
magazine
which
was
found
to
be
obscene
by
the
two
courts
below
unanimously
reversed
by
this
court.
there
was
one
magazine,
a
homosexual
magazine
vying
for
homosexuals.
the
ninth
circuit
characterized
it
as
cheap
pornography,
unanimously
reversed
by
this
court.
there
was
the
times
film
case
involving
the
film,
“game
of
love”
reversed
by
this
court
i
believe
7-to-2.
there
was
mount
case
where
the
court
below
sought
to
have
a
standard
which
was
broader
than
what
was
involved
in
roth-alberts.
there
the
courts
below
said
that
it
could
have
offended
the
sense
of
decency,
propriety,
and
morality
that
the
work
was
obscene.
the
solicitor
general
confessed
error
and
upon
remand
the
case
went
back
to
the
trial
court
and
the
material
which
the
trial
court
theretofore
had
found
was
obscene,
on
remand
he
said
it
was
not
obscene
under
the
more
demanding
standard
of
this
court
in
roth-alberts.
and
then
finally
of
course
there
was
the
kingsley
case
just
recently
decided.
the
short
of
it
is,
we
suggest
your
honor,
that
there
is
now
the
kind
of
limitation
upon
suppression
of
this
kind
of
speech
which
is
measured
in
large
measure
at
least
by
the
kind
of
material
which
was
presented
to
this
court
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
roth
case
what
he
designated
as
hardcore
pornography.
this,
the
court
will
recall,
consisted
primarily
of
pictures.
it
consisted
of
movies,
and
the
cheap
productions
which
were
thought
to
have
no
ideas,
no
ideas
at
all
and
with
all
the
deference
i
think
that
we
must
recall
what
it
was
that
the
court
had
before
it
there.
it
was
a
statute
only
on
its
face
that
was
being
sustained
within
a
framework
of
the
solicitor
general
saying
that
we
don't
want
to
reach
very
much.
all
we
do
say
is
that
we
should
be
allowed
to
reach
something
and
then
giving
to
the
court
the
kind
of
thing
that
they
thought
should
be
reachable
and
only
the
kind
of
thing
that
should
be
reachable.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
was
the
roth
case,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
but
of
course
the
opinion
was
a
single
opinion
and
applicable
as
to
both
courts.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
at
least
on
three
occasions
the
court
has
said
that
there
was
a
single
standard.
that
neither
the
federal
government
nor
the
state
could
go
below
this
line
in
terms
of
suppression.
now
we
turn
to
the
book.
we
turn
to
the
book,
“sweeter
than
life”
and
what
do
we
find?
i
dare
say
that
had
this
book
come
before
the
members
of
this
court
or
any
tribunal,
without
the
problems
of
a
claim
of
obscenity,
that
this
simply
wouldn't
have
been
a
question
about
it
being
a
protected
book.
there's
nothing
about
the
way
it
looks,
feels,
the
way
it's
printed,
or
the
way
it
is
written
which
suggests
that
it
can
be
obscene
under
the
demanding
standards
of
this
book.
that
the
book
has
important
ideas
of
it,
it
seems
to
us
to
be
beyond
question.
for
example,
it
has
as
a
suggestion,
that
female
homosexuality
is
not
necessarily
inherited.
that
it
is
environmentally
caused
and
that
you
do
well
to
look
at
the
attitudes
of
parents
and
friends
and
events
to
understand
this.
it
tells
us
that
many
people
who
are
afflicted
with
this
aberration
seek
to
compensate
by
amassing
money
and
power
and
the
mistaken
thought
that
this
will
overcome
it
or
at
least
be
a
deficient-compensating
factor
and
finally
the
book
says
that
revenge
on
society
because
of
such
an
aberration
is
foolish.
now,
i'm
not
saying,
and
i'm
sure
that
no
one
here
would
say
that
this
is
great
literature,
but
how
many
of
the
novels
that
are
put
out
today
can
go
under
the
label
of
great
literature
nor
certainly
can
the
court
sit
in
terms
of
passing
literary
judgment
upon
a
work.
but
here
we
have
a
book
which
has
ideas,
the
importance
of
discussing
the
theme
of
homosexuality
at
this
time
particularly,
cannot
be
denied.
in
england
for
example,
the
entire
sexual
code
is
undergoing
a
revision
and
having
as
its
purpose
the
making
of
it
lawful
to
permit
voluntary
partners
of
adults
to
engage
in
homosexual
activity
without
offending
the
criminal
code.
and
the
american
law
institute
in
its
model
code
has
made
a
similar
proposal.
now
if
the
people
are
to
act
wisely,
if
we
are
to
fulfill
our
part
in
terms
of
informing
our
legislators
on
how
we
fill
upon
this
important
subject,
surely
the
subject
as
such
must
be
open.
people
must
be
allowed
to
pick
and
choose
and
i
don't
know
how,
a
novel
could
be
written
about
homosexuality
which
would
be
realistic
and
meaningful
without
depicting
in
some
way,
the
fact
that
there
are
sexual
relations
between
members
of
the
same
sex
and
that
is,
we
submit
all
that
we
have
here.
in
terms
of
the
manner
in
which
the
sexual
scenes
or
depictions
were
set
forth
in
the
book,
i
think
that
without
pressing
the
point
too
much
in
this,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
suggested,
you
wouldn't
have
a
novel.
you
can't
find
a
novel
today
that
doesn't
deal
and
then
deal
in
a
great
deal
of
particularity
and
candidness,
with
sexual
events.
and
we
suggest
that
in
terms
of
depiction
and
representation,
this
book,
“sweeter
than
life”
is
pallid,
that
books
like
lady
chatterley's
lover,
to
name
just
one
although
later,
that
these
books
go
far
beyond
the
book,
“sweeter
than
life.”
magazines,
even
family
magazines,
ladies'
home
journal
and
the
cosmopolitan,
they
are
apparently
obsessed
with
the
feelings
on
the
discussion
of
sex,
to
say
nothing
of
magazines
like
playboy.
but
all
of
this,
if
the
court
please,
is
what
we
had
in
mind
when
we
said
that
it
is
contemporary
community
standards
that
we
must
look
to.
we
should
remember
that
there
are
films
on
the
market
now
which
weren't
on
the
market
10
years
ago.
there
are
films
that
are
openly
shown
to
everyone
which
would
have
shaken
our
society
to
its
foundation,
25
years
ago,
but
we're
here,
we
accept
it.
people
look
at
it
without
shame,
without
morbidity.
they
consider
it
candidly
and
being
able
to
see
films,
television,
plays,
novels,
magazines,
we
submit
it
is
just
unconscionable
to
suggest
that
this
book
is
obscene
within
this
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
motion
pictures
such
as
the
lady
chatterley's
lover
or
the
moon
is
blue
which
was
this
court's
concern
in
the
holmby
case.
there's
been
a
movement
that
i
just
said
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes.
i'm
talking
about
motion
picture
films
generally
exhibited.
in
terms,
if
the
court
please,
of
the
impact
of
sustaining
a
conviction
in
this
case,
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
not
only
would
this
endanger
literally
thousands
of
books
because
if
we're
right,
that
in
terms
of
themes,
description
of
representations,
it
is
not
distinguishable
from
thousands
of
books,
that
means
that
if
los
angeles
can
convict
a
bookseller
for
the
possession
of
“sweeter
than
life”,
it
can
convict
him
for
the
possession
of,
let's
say
thousands
of
books
and
not
just
los
angeles
because
if
our
municipality
can
do
it,
every
municipality
can
do
the
same
thing.
and
also
it
would
re-open
all
of
our
problems
of
vagueness
because
if
we
say
a
“sweeter
than
life”
can
be
obscene,
then
i
decry
this
court
or
any
court
to
draw
line
that
would
be
meaningful
and
understandable
that
would
less-be-safe,
kill-within-the-line
and
punish
a
person
for
the
possession
of
it
without
killing
thousands
of
books
again,
both
on
the
vagueness
point
and
in
terms
of
the
number
that
would
be
involved.
so
that
our
first
point
in
this
regard
is
that
the
book
simply
is
a
protected
book
and
it
does
direct
offense
to
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
by
permitting
los
angeles
to
punish
this
bookseller
who
is
not
pandering.
there's
no
question
here
of
any
special
appeal.
this
book
was
sitting
in
a
book
stock
shop,
in
a
bookshop
where
there
were
thousands
of
other
books,
we
say
that
that
does
grave
offense
to
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
we
reach
now
to
our
second
point
if
the
court
please,
and
that
is
we
did
try
very
seriously
to
introduce
evidence
on
what
we
deem
to
be
a
crucial
issue.
this
court
having
given
us
a
defense,
namely,
that
if
our
book
does
not
go
beyond
contemporary
community
standards
it
could
not
be
condemned,
we
sought
to
avail
ourselves
of
that
defense
and
we
brought
in
expert
witnesses.
we
brought
in
for
example
the
book
review
critic
of
the
los
angeles
times
who
testified
that
he
read
some
30
books
a
week.
that
he
was
familiar
with
contemporary
community
standards
and
who
was
about
to
tell
the
court
how
this
book
compared
with
the
books
that
were
on
the
market
generally
and
we
were
cut
off
and
the
trial
court
took
the
position
that
the
book
spoke
for
itself.
it
had
to
be
measured
only
by
what
it
said.
it
couldn't
be
compared
with
other
books
and
in
this
the
trial
court
was
affirmed
by
the
appellate
department.
the
appellate
department
went
back
to
the
old
case
of
wepplo
which
preceded
alberts
and
there
it
was
said
it
doesn't
matter
if
there
are
the
same
books
or
sexually
more
provocative
books
on
the
market
generally
in
the
area.
whether
the
book
is
in
the
library
is
of
no
concern,
all
of
this
was
ruled
out
both
on
the
trial
court
and
by
the
appellate
court.
in
this
we
say
we
were
denied
due
process
of
law,
if
the
court
please,
because
certainly
if
we
had
evidence
to
present
on
an
issue
and
if
one
of
the
issues
before
the
court
was,
does
our
book
go
substantially
beyond
contemporary
community
standards
to
deny
us
any
opportunity,
not
just
the
opportunity
by
one
way,
but
to
deny
us
all
opportunities
to
show
that
our
book
did
not
go
beyond
contemporary
community
standards,
to
show
that
our
book
did
not
have
a
substantial
tendency
to
corrupt
or
deprave,
to
show
that
our
book
considered
as
a
whole
could
be
read
candidly
and
openly
by
the
people.
that
it
did
not
appeal
to
a
prurient
interest,
it's
denied
to
us,
we
suggest
due
process
of
law,
and
again
it
is
denied
to
us
free
speech
because
unless
we're
given
the
opportunity
of
presenting
evidence
on
the
fact
that
our
book
does
not
go
beyond
contemporary
community
standards
a
trier
of
fact
who
may
not
be
informed
about
contemporary
community
standards
may
believe
that
our
book
is
not
constitutionally
protected
and
punish
a
person
for
the
possession,
when
in
fact
it
is
a
constitutionally
protected
book.
the
trier
of
the
fact
here
for
example,
judge
pope,
apparently
was
particularly
concerned
with
the
plot.
he
was
disturbed
by
the
notion
that
there
was
a
woman
who
left
her
husband
to
take
up
with
another
woman.
this
bothered
him.
it
appears
that
he
was
not
familiar
with
the
literature
in
this
field.
it's
no
reflection
upon
and
i
wouldn't
expect
him
to
be
as
well
read
as
a
book
review
critic,
but
surely
he
should
have
known
before
he
passed
judgment
that
there
were
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
books
including
hundreds
of
novels
which
dealt
with
this
theme
and
which
dealt
with
this
theme
as
candidly,
as
openly,
and
as
frankly.
and
that
without
this
knowledge,
the
judge
was
unable
to
pass
intelligently
upon
this
question
and
in
fact
reached
the
book
which
had
no
basis
and
should
not
have
been
reached.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
we
would
have
had
the
same
problem
your
honor
because
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
we
waived
the
trial
by
jury.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
we
had
the
right
and
we
waived
the
trial
by
jury
in
that
case.
i
might
say
parenthetically
though,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
we
have
a
problem
in
this
type
of
case.
there
were
originally
19
counts
in
this
case,
and
there
were
many
books.
and
if
we
had
tried
this
case
to
a
jury,
we
would
have
been
there
for
a
year
because
as
it
is
and
it
shows
up
in
the
record,
that
the
trial
court
took
the
book
home
and
he
read
and
he
reread
it
so
that
we
did
have
the
trial
for
jury
and
we're
not
making
that
point,
i
merely
say
that
we
sometimes
buck
in
a
situation
such
as
we
have
here.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
in
this
book
shop,
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
had
thought
the
question
was
as
to
the
character
of
the
books
generally.
no,
in
this
bookshop
there
was
no
showing
or
an
attempt
to
show
that
this
book
--
this
bookshop
had
anything
but
the
normal
kind
of
books
that
you
would
find
in
a
brentano's
or
any
other
bookshop.
there
was
no
attempt
to
show
that
there
was
any
catering
to
a
special
class
or
that
there
was
a
predominance
of
one
kind
of
book
over
another.
i
do
believe
that
it
came
out
in
the
record
that
there
were
magazines
such
as
life,
vogue,
and
cosmopolitan
in
the
totality.
he
had
thousands
of
books
and
magazines.
it
was
a
large
bookstore.
i
think
the
police
officers
testified
generally
as
to
the
character
of
the
store.
and
it
appeared
to
be
good-sized
bookshop,
without
any
emphasis
on
any
particular
kind
of
material.
now
the
third
point
that
we
have
raised
and
i
will
discuss
is
the
standard
that
was
utilized
by
the
courts
below.
we
have
said
that
it
was
essentially
a
butler,
(inaudible)
and
patrick
standard,
however,
you
want
to
formulate
it,
but
what
seems
clear
to
us
is
that
the
trial
court
took
the
position
that
he
was
essentially
a
thermometer.
that
he
was
there
for
the
purpose
of
measuring
the
heat
of
the
book.
when
we
suggested
that
the
test
of
this
court
was
it
had
to
be
the
impact
of
a
material
on
an
average
normal
person,
he
said
no.
he
said
its
average
normal
persons
who
determined
the
impact
upon
use
in
particularly
susceptible
persons
and
this
came
through
again
and
again.
he
said
for
example
that
he
was
depressed
by
the
reading
of
the
book.
we
suggested
that
that
may
be,
but
how
does
that
make
it
criminal?
how
does
that
prove
that
it
goes
beyond
contemporary
community
standards
that
appeals
to
prurient
interest
and
then
he
went
off
in
the
direction
of
well
it
depressed
me
because
i
may
--
i'm
vaccinated.
i've
lived
my
life
and
we
have
to
think
of
how
it
would
affect
the
young
and
the
unprotected.
and
it
was
this
in
this
regard,
i
think,
that
the
court,
the
appellate
court's
determination
that
it
was
free
to
fashion
a
standard,
less
demanding
than
this
court's
standard
in
roth-alberts
must
be
understood.
and
it
was
interesting
in
another
regard
where
the
appellate
court
apparently
tried
to
read
out
the
notion
of
the
book
having
to
go
beyond
contemporary
community
standards
before
it
could
be
reached
as
an
obscene
book
because
judge
david
said
that
if
the
people
wanted
to
they
could
give
--
they
could
redefine
these
words
which
are
so
commonly
understood
by
the
people.
and
by
that
i
understood
him
to
be
saying
that
obscene
has
a
meaning,
an
ordinary
meaning
and
the
legislature
has
not
changed
it.
our
position
was
throughout
the
case
that
in
effect
this
court
in
alberts
had
read
into
every
obscenity
statute
at
least
the
proviso
that
no
books
could
be
condemned
as
obscene
if
it
did
not
go
beyond
contemporary
community
standards,
if
it
did
not
appeal
to
prurient
interest
of
the
average
person
considering
the
work
as
a
whole.
again
it
should
be
recalled
that
here
the
appellate
department
did
not
try
to
justify
in
any
legal
sense
at
least,
the
determination
that
the
book
was
obscene.
there
was
no
discussion
of
the
book
when
we
suggested
that
the
wrong
test
was
applied.
the
appellate
department
said,
“well,
it
doesn't
matter.
we'll
say
it's
obscene
under
any
test.”
and
then
we
had
the
problem
of
the
easy
labeling
that
mr.
justice
harlan
properly
warned
against
in
terms
of
just
giving
a
stamp
on
it.
so
that
we
in
effect
and
in
truth,
in
this
case,
find
ourselves
with
a
defendant
who
was
given
30
days
in
jail
for
having
in
his
possession
a
book
which
has
as
its
major
crime,
the
fact
that
it
discusses
a
theme
of
lesbianism
and
that
it
does
so
with
some
degree
of
realism
and
that
is
all.
the
crucial
issue
here
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
so
much
whether
the
book
goes
beyond
contemporary
community
standards
or
at
least
the
issue
below
seems
to
be
not
whether
it
went
beyond
contemporary
community
standards,
but
whether
it
was
good,
whether
it
was
right
to
have
this
kind
of
discussion
going
on
and
it
was
because
the
trial
court
felt
that
it
was
not
good,
because
the
trial
court
thought
it
was
not
right,
that
he
found
it
to
be
obscene.
whether
we
think
it's
good
or
bad
though,
of
course
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter.
we
may
personally
prefer
one
way
or
the
other,
but
that
is
not
the
test
and
the
test
has
to
be
under
the
appropriate
test.
if
we
were
to
apply
this
court's
ruling
in
roth-alberts
it
would
be
manifest
that
this
book
is
as
far
away
from
being
obscene
as
one
could
imagine
and
still
be
up
before
this
court
at
least
to
have
with
the
defendant.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
thank
you,
if
the
court
please.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
merely
to
one
point
that
i
think
has
been
stated
so
much
that
it
needs
a
little
clarification
and
that
is
the
difference
between
the
commercial
exploitation
of
filth
that
mr.
arnebergh
has
described
it.
if
this
court
was
talking
about
in
roth-alberts
and
the
attempt
to
equate
it
with
what's
going
on
here,
here
there
was
no
pushing
of
anything.
if
mr.
smith
was
commercially
exploiting
anything,
then
every
person
who
went
to
the
drugstore
and
has
any
books
and
magazines
there
is
equally
commercially
exploiting.
every
market
that
has
paper
bound
books
is
equally
commercially
exploiting.
these
are
easy
words
that
give
it
a
meaning
that
doesn't
apply
here.
what
mr.
smith
had
was
a
bookstore
and
he
had
a
book
on
the
stand
on
his
shelf.
in
roth,
as
we
pointed
out,
there
was
intrusion
into
the
homes
of
the
unwilling
person.
there
were
mailings,
there
were
mailings
which
were
exploiting
there
can't
be
any
denial
in
terms
of
the
advertising
there
being
at
least
very
aggressive.
that
differs
entirely
from
the
situation
we
have
here.
the
situation
we
have
here
is
simply
whether
a
person
who
sells
books
is
to
be
treated
differently
because
he
is
selling
books,
because
he
is
selling
the
ideas
whether
he
is
to
be
treated
differently
than
a
person
who
is
selling
these
cattle
or
a
person
who
happens
to
have
a
machine
gun.
a
point
was
made
in
terms
of
the
buyer
or
book
buyer
taking
normal
precautions.
well,
the
record
here
shows
that
the
--
mr.
smith
took
normal
precautions.
the
record
shows
that
he
purchased
his
book
through
the
mail,
that
he
received
it
from
regular
jobbers,
that
he
had
a
book
in
this
case,
“sweeter
than
life”
which
was
copyrighted
and
we've
heard
a
lot
about
copyright
and
whoever
heard
of
copyrighting
pornographic
literature
before
anyhow?
isn't
the
bookseller
protected
at
least
to
that
extent
to
be
seeing
the
copyright?
well,
no
it's
taken
by
the
government.
it's
--
the
book
is
here.
it's
in
the
congressional
library
and
anybody
can
go
in
and
buy
it.
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
evil
mr.
arnebergh
is
talking
about
the
evil
of
this
book.
he's
taken
everything
he
could
find
out
of
the
book
and
hit
it
like
he
has
put
into
his
brief,
all
of
these
graphic
descriptions
and
it
went
through
the
mail
and
everybody
has
read
it.
no
evil,
this
isn't
eating
poison.
would
anybody
for
a
moment
suggest
that
the
reading
of
this
brief
which
is
the
undiluted
assets
that
mr.
arnebergh
is
complaining
about,
is
anything
there,
maybe
accept
something
that
would
offend
your
personal
taste
and
that's
all.
insofar
as
we're
talking
about
the
moral,
mr.
arnebergh
says
there
is
a
lesson
here
that
lesbianism
is
good.
i
happen
to
read
the
book
differently,
but
this
court
said
that
you
can
talk
about
adultery
that
way.
that
you
can
even
advocate
adultery
and
that
doesn't
offend
the
first
amendment.
and
if
that's
what
the
book
said,
i
deny
it,
but
if
it
is
what
the
book
said
that
would
not
be
private
in
any
fashion
we
submit
from
the
protection
afforded
by
free
speech.
i
think
the
court
has
pointed
out
the
obvious
fallacy
or
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
obvious
fallacy
of
the
copyright
argument
in
that
society
is
concerned
much
more
with
the
right
of
the
people
to
read
than
it
is
with
the
right
of
a
person
to
say
what
he
wants
to
say.
the
right
to
say
it
is
important,
but
the
right
of
people
to
hear
it
and
weigh
it
is
far
more
important.
and
that
includes
the
right
to
weigh
and
consider
ideas
we
do
not
like
and
that
is
what's
in
jeopardy
here.
mr.
arnebergh
recognized
that
you
have
to
take
free
speech
out
to
attempt
to
rationalize
the
illogical
and
the
unfair
aspects
of
this
case.
i
don't
think
you
can
read
free
speech
out.
the
right
to
distribute
the
book
is
equally
protected
with
the
right
to
--
right
of
the
book.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
