justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it
doesn't
include
the
right
to
sell
a
book?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
correct
or
incorrect
that
it
is
not
protected
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
first
amendment
is
trying
this
argument
from
the
idea
of
the
writings
in
a
book.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
sale
a
book
via
the
right
to
bring
a
publication
and
printing
a
book
by
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
the
fact
that
the
book
is
copyrighted,
takes
away
the
right
of
people
to
read
it
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
still
a
book.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it's
privilege,
it's
still
a
book
even
though
it's
covered
outside.
i
understand
your
argument
that
it
is
not
privileged
because
it's
on
print.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
quite
follow.
you're
on
the
idea
that
somehow
because
the
book's
copyrighted
--
to
display
as
something
is
to
be
disseminated
that
the
public
can
reach
it
if
it
wants
to
and
if
the
public
can
secure
by
purchase
or
otherwise,
does
it
seem
fit?
i
don't
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
made
a
political
speech
and
charged
people
for
hearing
and
they
wouldn't
hearing
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
he
does
copyright
his
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
there
that
if
a
man
makes
some
political
speech
and
copyrights
it
he's
not
protected
by
the
freedom
of
the
first
amendment
or
they
maybe
affected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
pretty
good
care.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
the
copyrights
of
a
book
proscribe
all
books
that
take
the
democratic
side
of
the
adoption
or
the
public
side,
but
he
had
this
book
that
is
copyrighted,
discussing
apart,
would
the
--
that
book
be
protected
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
you
get
back
to
where
there's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i've
seen
it
--
i've
seen
it.
do
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
exploitation
of
books,
can
you
claim
that
because
they
are
obscene
they
could
not
be
--
that
you
have
a
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
buy
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
argument
then
finally
boils
down
to
this
make
it
right,
i've
never
heard
it
before
that
a
copyrighted
book
can
be
regulated
more
strictly
than
one
which
is
not
copyrighted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
it's
tested
and
it's
one
in
private
homes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
you
were
saying
was
no
(inaudible)
going
i
think
there
is
the
idea
that
in
existence
it
cannot
utilized
consistently
with
free
speech
and
free
press.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
country
has
chosen
to
leave
to
sale,
ownership
and
so
forth
with
transaction
in
the
sales
of
books
and
in
the
sales
of
other
things.
but
do
you
not
or
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
if
you
make
this
with
pay
--
if
you
say
if
it's
a
copyright,
changes
a
book
where
it's
nothing
but
property,
it's
still
a
book.
it
still
has
its
ideas.
it
still
has
whatever
impression
here,
whatever
impression
could
be
drawn.
while
it
has
been
given
certain
property
protection
under
the
law,
it
does
--
it
does
not
if
i
made
a
filling
a
book
with
ideas
to
which
the
people
are
entitled
to
receive
under
the
first
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
also
have
the
right
to
receive
it,
do
you
not,
from
other
people
even
if
they
have
to
buy
a
book?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
don't
turn
that
book
lose
into
the
world.
each
one
has
a
copyright.
they've
turned
it
lose
for
the
ideas
it
has,
whatever
they
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
copyright
doesn't
deprive
it
of
its
ideas,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
--
it
doesn't
make
it
at
any
rate
mass,
like
a
mass
of
goods
in
the
store
does
it,
and
lose
its
quality
as
a
conveyor
of
ideas.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
not
his
right
to
freedom
of
the
press
and
to
be
a
circulating
medium
for
the
press?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
old
--
old
idea
but
i
already
thought
maybe.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
next
book
that
was
not
filthy
but
it
was
decided
to
acquire
it
and
the
argument
it
was
merely
copyrighted
it
and
we
had
the
right
to
bar
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
is
to
decide
whether
or
not
read
it
to
be
subject
to
a
requirement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
gathered
from
you
the
test
here
was
that
it
was
obscene
because
it
contained
descriptions
that
--
the
descriptions
of
sexual
acts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
for
those
have
been
described
that
graphically
in
any
other
language
as
you
would
have
believed
it
with
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
had
described
it
--
would
there
have
been
any
difference
with
the
exact
phrases
that
were
used
insofar
as
obscenity
is
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
contain
--
or
simply
as
i
understand
you
to
say,
along
(inaudible)
the
descriptions
of
the
sexual
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
description
of
that
is
what
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
any
book
that
does
that
which
come
under
the
ban,
if
you
tired
that
as
you're
trying
to
get
that,
i
think
that
would
be
the
result.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
this
character
that
was
engaged
before
the
book
was
ended?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
relations
to
her
acts
with
the
man,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
murdered
her.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
this
--
how
would
we
say
that
this
book
sold
by
a
man
could
read
a
lot
of
books,
i
mean
here,
which
should
be
a
description
to
that
and
no
a
quick
warrant,
must
be
barred
by
the
law
and
which
one
would
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
from
your
standpoint
it
makes
no
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
your
argument
is
that
the
state
does
have
a
right
to
censor
obscene
literature.
but
since
it
has
the
right
to
censor
obscene
literature
it
also
has
power
to
say
that
we're
going
to
hold
you
responsible
for
selling
whether
you
know
anything
about
it
or
not.
that's
the
basic
basis
your
argument,
that
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
from
your
standpoint
you
finally
get
back
to
the
place
of
whether
it
is
constitutional
to
bar
this
kind
of
book
even
from
the
possession
of
a
man
who
doesn't
know
what's
in
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
abide
to
the
(inaudible)
opinion.
