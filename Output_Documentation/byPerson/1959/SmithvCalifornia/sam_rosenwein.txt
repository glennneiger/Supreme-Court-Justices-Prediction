mr.
sam
rosenwein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
other
aspect
of
the
case
is
the
exclusion
of
all
scienter
requirements
from
the
ordinance.
the
court
below
held
that
this
statute
was
to
be
equated
with
those
public
welfare
offenses
which
exclude
all
requirements
of
the
intent
or
scienter
and
punish
proprietors
or
individuals
who
have
violated
the
law
without
regard
to
any
question
of
intent.
these
public
welfare
offenses
the
court
referred
to
dealt
with
the
sale
of
adulterated
food,
the
sale
of
dangerous
weapons,
the
abatement
of
some
public
nuisances,
the
sale
of
narcotics,
and
so
forth.
after
having
reviewed
those
cases,
the
court
said,
“and
so
with
books.”
and
so
the
court
held
that
the
--
a
proprietor
of
a
bookshop
could
properly
be
convicted
for
possessing
an
obscene
book
even
if
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
contents
or
the
character
of
the
book.
the
court
said,
“unless
some
higher
court
told
it
otherwise,
they
would
not
permit
the
proprietor
of
a
bookshop
with
impunity
to
adopt
that
poetic
phrase,
‘where
ignorance
is
bliss,
it's
folly
to
be
wise'.”
now
our
position
with
respect
to
this
statute
or
at
least
the
issues
presented
are
that
the
statute
thus
construed
and
applied
tends
directly
to
abridge,
to
invade
the
areas
of
speech
and
press
that
it
creates
as
to
an
innocent
person
again
those
indefinite
standards
of
criminality
which
were
mooted
in
alberts
and
roth
and
bring
all
of
the
problems
back
once
again.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
guilty
knowledge.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
knowledge
that
the
book
is
obscene.
he
would
have
of
course
first
shown
to
have
had
knowledge
of
the
contents
and
from
that,
inferences
might
be
drawn,
or
proof
would
have
to
be
made.
at
least,
he
would
have
to
have
the
opportunity
to
say,
“i
was
honestly
ignorant
of
the
contents
and
i
did
know
that
it
was
obscene.”
that
is
what
the
court
ruled
out,
scienter
is
guilty
knowledge.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no.
they're
not
required
to
under
the
statute.
under
the
statute
the
court
has
held
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
would
say
as
a
minimum
they
would
of
course
have
to
prove
that
he
had
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
the
book.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
had
read
it.
well
as
to
that,
i
would
say
they
sometimes
prove
that
knowledge
of
contents
or
character
more
sometimes
by
admission
and
sometimes
by
conversations
and
things
of
that
kind
do
occur
but
i
think
generally
speaking
that
he
had
read
the
contents
of
the
book.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
that
is
right
your
honor.
now
of
course
it's
up
to
the
state,
one
state
have
a
provision
for
scienter,
i
would
say
in
the
event
the
burdens
of
proof
were
shifted,
presumptions,
rebuttable
presumptions
created
that
would
be
of
course
a
different
problem
from
a
constitutional
viewpoint.
but
when
the
state
says
we're
not
going
to
permit
you
to
even
testify
as
to
whether
or
not
you
are
honestly
ignorant,
then
we're
not
going
to
require
of
any
proof
of
any
kind.
in
other
words
you're
the
absolute
guarantor
of
the
sexual
purity
of
the
book.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
the
record
he
--
they
prove
nothing.
they
just
put
in
the
book.
he
took
the
stand
and
testified
he's
a
man
of
72
years
of
age.
that
he
had
not
read
this
book.
he
hadn't
read
it
for
sometime
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
he
was
in
the
business
of
buying
books.
he
ordered
generally
from
new
york,
from
the
east
of
circulars,
new
books,
publishers,
very
often
sent
to
him
without
an
order
if
publishers
do
that.
they
just
send
books
out
and
did
what
the
normal
bookseller
does.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
no,
that
isn't
quite
accurate
your
honor.
i
mean
there
are
different
ways
of
proving
guilty
knowledge.
i
would
say
also
and
we
would
ready
to
concede
that
if
there
was
a
reckless
disregard
of
the
facts
which
a
person
should
have
known
in
some
way
i
would
say
that
that
too
might
be
included
in
the
area
of
scienter.
i
thought
the
court's
reference
to
a
rule
of
conduct
where
ignorance
is
bliss,
was
really
dealing
with
the
person
who
was
guilty,
in
other
words,
recklessly
disregarding
the
facts.
that
isn't
the
situation
that
we're
posing
here.
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
where
the
person
admittedly
is
innocent.
he
has
no
intent.
he
just
doesn't
have
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
the
book.
he's
in
business
of
buying
books,
selling
them
and
he
has
thousands
of
books
in
his
shelf.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
of
--
by
motions,
demurrers
and
so
forth
and
all
the
way
up
to
statement
on
appeal.
this
is
the
law.
i
don't
think
there's
any
jurisdiction
in
the
law.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
oh
yes
all
the
way
through.
now
it's
--
the
first
problem
you
have
when
you
deal
with
an
innocent
proprietor
of
a
bookshop
is
this.
if
you're
going
to
ask
him,
if
you
say
to
him,
“regardless
of
all
the
reasonable
precautions
you
take,
regardless
of
how
much
good
faith
you
take
in
trying
to
determine,
to
get
rid
of
and
not
have
any
hardcore
pornography
or
obscenity
in
your
shop,
no
matter
what
you
do,
nevertheless
you
will
be
guilty.“
the
inevitable
tendency
of
that
kind
of
a
direction
is
to
stop
the
flow
of
books
because
the
books
are
either
going
to
save
himself
--
i
better
get
out
of
this
business
entirely,
or
else
i
had
better
get
as
far
as
away
from
books
dealing
with
sex
as
i
possibly
can.
it,
of
course,
becomes
an
awful
weapon
in
the
hands
of
police
officials
and
of
private
censorial
groups
whom
now
can
say
to
him,
“either
this
book
gets
off,
or
you'll
be
spending
in
jail
once
a
week
at
least.”
moreover,
he's
not
in
a
position.
he's
the
weakest
in
the
whole
hierarchy
of
people
involved
in
the
circulation
of
the
press
to
defend
the
book.
he
can't
afford
to
take
anyone
particular
book
on.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
court's
decisions
in
virtually
all
areas
of
speech,
press
and
assembly
whenever
appeal
sanctions
have
been
visited
on
an
innocent
person
whether
it
was
enjoining
an
alleged
subversive
organization
that
he
knew
nothing
about,
the
inevitable
tendency
in
all
these
cases
is
to
immediately
frighten
people
away
from
joining,
immediately
frighten
them
away
from
getting
books,
from
speaking.
and
so
in
this
case,
too,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
would
be
the
inevitable
result
because
he
cannot.
it
is
an
absolute
impossibility
to
read
every
single
book
and
then
having
read
the
book
to
say,
“does
this
individual
book
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
average
person
measured
by
contemporary
community
standards
considering
the
dominant
theme
of
the
book
taken
as
a
whole?”
you
have
to
do
that
as
to
every
book.
and
if,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
test
in
the
state
court
is
perhaps
not
the
same
and
there
has
been
some
differences
as
to
whether
it
is
or
not,
he
must
then
say,
“to
be
on
the
safe
side,
does
the
book
taken
as
whole
and
measured
by
the
average
person
and
applying
contemporary
community
standards,
have
a
substantial
tendency
to
corrupt
and
deprave
him
by
arousing
lascivious
thoughts
and
lustful
desires?
i
don't
think
i
have
to
press
the
point
that
no
bookseller
can
possibly
assume
that
burden,
no
person
could.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
that
is
right.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
that
is
right.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
think
what
wepplo
has
decided
that
we've
never
been
happy
about
it.
i
would
like
someday
to
talk
it
over
again
with
the
court,
but
what
it
did
say
was
this,
“the
statute
requires
a
proof
of
lewd
intent.”
now
that
maybe
a
little
difficult
to
prove,
but
it,
like
everything
else,
is
not
entirely
impossible.
for
example,
if
the
cover
of
the
book
has
a
suggestive
picture
and
a
suggestive
title,
well
that
might
at
least
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
which
would
then
put
the
owners,
the
defendant
to
read
by
it
and
in
the
fact
they
--
they
suggested
that
lewd
intent
should
be
true.
there
is
no
doubt
california
has
had
this,
a
provision
for
over
a
hundred
years
and
prosecuted
these
obscenity
cases.
i
don't
have
to
tell
your
court
to
say,
“it's
sometimes
successful
because
only
two
years
ago
alberts
was
affirmed.”
that
was
a
311
state
conviction.
now
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
imagine
that
under
wepplo
it
probably
would
be
considered
fairly
well
along
the
line
and
approved.
we
would
argue
i
think
that
would.
i
think
that
to
be
candid
i
would
i
say
i
think
it's
not
enough
to
just
say,
“i
think
the
book
is
obscene
without
something
more
to
indicate
a
real
knowledge
and
a
real
guilty
knowledge
of
as
for
example,
supposing
the
man
said
he
was
astonished
in
the
light
of
that
it's
being
published
today
to
have
the
police
officer
or
the
police
chief
say
so.”
but
i
think
this
would
create
questions
of
fact
at
a
trial
and
the
jury
to
properly
determine
whether
or
not
scienter
was
there.
that's
all
that
it
amounts
to.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
it
isn't
incumbent
on
them
to
do
it
that
way.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
under
wepplo
that
might
be
enough.
now
the
second
point
that
we
raise
beside
the
invasion
of
the
first
amendment
rights
or
invasion
of
the
free
speech
in
the
assembly
is
the
fact
that
we
have
the
problems
once
again
that
were
up
in
the
alberts
and
roth.
now
in
alberts
and
roth,
you
were
dealing
in
both
cases
with
situations
involving
scienter.
the
instructions
had
to
be
given
to
that
effect
in
the
federal
court.
we
were
up
from
the
state
of
california
court
on
lewd
intent.
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
any
opinion
that
didn't
refer
to
the
fact
that
this
was
catering,
disseminating,
pandering,
forcing
this
material
is
out
for,
material
on
uninvited
--
on
people
who
hadn't
asked
for
it
much
to
their
--
almost
like
an
assault.
when
justice
brennan
wrote
his
decision
which
he
cited
a
number
of
decisions
that
dealt
with
the
problem
of
vagueness,
the
argument
was
made
that
the
statute
was
vague
as
defined
and
cited
a
whole
group
of
decisions
to
show
that
was
not
so
after
the
definition.
every
one
of
those
dealt
with
the
intentional
wrong-doing.
the
man
who
knows
what
he
is
doing.
and
as
to
such
a
person,
he
cannot
be
heard
to
claim
that
the
statute
is
too
indefinite
and
too
vague,
but
what
happens
when
you
apply
such
a
statute,
construe
and
apply
it
to
a
person
who's
honestly
ignorant
of
the
facts?
well
in
such
a
case,
what
you're
doing
is
setting
up
a
standard
that
for
a
criminal
statute,
it
seems
to
us,
makes
it
once
again
too
vague,
too
unfair.
he
doesn't
know
what
is
or
what
is
not
the
line?
it's
all
right
to
say
to
one
who
doesn't
know,
who's
in
the
business,
who's
catering,
trying
to
exploit
that
prurient
interest
to
say
to
him,
“well
never
you
mind
the
innocent
person
you
would
always
know
what
obscenity
means.”
but
once
you
begin
to
construe
and
apply
it
to
an
innocent
person,
i
think
you
will
then
reach
that
vagueness.
and
it
is
not
a
problem
that
has
really
been
settled
and
i'm
talking
of
the
indefiniteness
but
only
recently,
the
nebraska
supreme
court
invalidated
its
own
obscenity
statute
under
its
own
constitution
after
it
had
been
asked
to
put
the
interest
of
the
alberts'
definition,
this
court's
definition
on
its
statute
and
after
putting
that
impress
on
said,
“we
regret
it
still
remains
vague
under
our
constitution”
and
invalidated
its
own
law.
certainly
then
as
to
an
innocent
person,
we
would
assert
that
the
statute
--
the
ordinance
here
is
also
constitutionally
in
front.
now,
if
it
be
a
question
of
balancing,
if
it
could
be
said
that
well
even
so
with
all
the
inroads,
nevertheless
the
state
has
an
interest,
a
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
the
public
morals,
i
would,
without
attempting
to
cavil
as
to
whether
that
is
so
or
not
safe,
that
in
this
case
under
this
situation,
it
might
be
argued
that
it
fairly
minimal
because
as
i
said
before,
this
is
not
the
thrust,
this
is
not
the
unwanted
material.
this
isn't
even
a
newspaper
on
in
front
of
your
house
everyday
which
you
are
always
compelled
to
read.
this
is
a
book
shelf
where
people
don't
have
to
go
in
if
they
don't
want
to.
therefore,
the
extent
of
corruption
of
public
morals
from
an
obscene
book
from
an
ordinary
bookshop
would
seem
to
be
fairly
minimal.
but
admitting
that
there
is
some
state
interest,
i
would
like
to
point
out
besides
this
definite,
it
seems
to
us
inroads
of
the
constitutional
protection,
the
unreasonableness
of
the
thing,
the
--
the
harshness
and
the
oppressiveness
of
the
thing
that
--
that
seems
to
us
outweighs
whatever
alleged
state
interest
there
may
be.
in
the
first
place,
from
the
very
nature
of
things,
if
this
is
a
policing
problem,
let
us
say,
the
state
–
the
municipality
must
say
to
it's
a
bookseller's,
look
here,
we
want
some
help
on
this
question
of
obscenity.
now
if
few
people
will
make
a
good
faith
effort,
if
you
will
honestly
try
to
get
rid
of
your
obscene
books,
we
won't
prosecute
you.
but
here
the
state
says,
“we
don't
care
how
much
you
try
to
get
rid
of
obscene
books
no
matter
how
much
good
faith
you
use,
we
going
to
treat
you
the
same
as
any
lawbreaker.”
now
that
doesn't
help
to
fight
the
problem.
it
seems
to
us
it
drives
them
in
the
opposite
direction
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
very
reasonable
thing
to
do.
now
if
there's
been
an
equation
with
public
welfare
offenses,
but
when
i
go
in
to
buy
a
piece
of
meat,
a
pound
of
meat,
i
have
no
idea
whether
it's
tainted
or
not
and
i
go
home
and
jot
it
down
and
i'm
absolutely
helpless.
the
public
is
helpless
in
those
cases.
we
have
tons
of
books.
we've
entirely
different
situations.
when
i
go
into
a
book,
i
don't
rely
on
the
books
though.
i
don't
think
very
many
people
do.
and
if
i
may
browse,
i
make
my
own
decision.
i
take
the
book
home.
i
may
read
part
of
it
and
discard
it.
i'm
not
helpless
with
respect
to
these
books
--
book
proprietor.
i
make
my
own
determinations
and
the
equation
to
other
public
welfare
offenses
which
do
not
involve
the
important
basic
societal
interest
like
free
speech,
it
seem
to
us
to
be
somewhat
arbitrary.
moreover,
there's
a
stigma
to
be
called
a
smut
dealer,
a
merchant
in
obscenity
and
to
have
this
put
on
an
innocent
man,
seems
to
me
to
be
a
savage,
immoral
thing
to
do,
under
the
guise
of
protecting
public
morals.
it's
something
you
can't
eliminate.
and
as
to
difficulties
approved,
i
would
like
to
say
this
that
since
specially
decision
in
this
court,
that
connecticut,
north
carolina,
wisconsin,
and
many
a
number
of
other
states
has
all
put
in
requirements
of
a
lewd
intent,
of
guilty
--
of
guilty
knowledge
of
scienter
and
have
written,
by
the
way
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
has
just
said
that
this
they
found
a
salutary
provision
in
marking
the
line
between
due
process,
the
procedural
due
process
and
substantive
due
process.
the
american
law
institute
rejects
any
notion
of
a
conclusive
--
conclusive
presumption
of
this
kind.
california
has
followed
it.
in
ireland
we
called
attention
to
a
very
recent
decision
in
which
this
court's
decisions
in
alberts
and
roth
were
all
reviewed
and
special
emphasis
was
placed
on,
in
freeing
a
person
charged
with
exhibiting
an
obscene
and
indecent
show
which
was
the
rose
tattoo
by
the
american
dramatist
tennessee
williams
was
placed
on
the
intent,
on
the
failure
of
any
proof
of
intent
as
saving
freedom
of
the
press
and
speech.
it's
there
under
a
fairly
different
constitution
which
permits
more
inroads
to
speak
than
here.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes
it
is.
it's
the
state
against
sule
and
i
think
it's
on
page
34
of
course,
in
the
index
as
well.
and
we
point
out
in
our
brief
finally
that
in
california,
the
state
has
had
this
rule
of
proof
of
lewd
intent
for
a
hundred
years
and
had
no
difficulty
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
many
other
areas
in
the
field
of
bigamy,
even
with
possession
of
narcotics.
under
the
state
california
supreme
court
rules,
you
have
to
prove
possession
of
knowledge
of
the
narcotic
character
and
then
there
has
been
no
difficulty
in
proving
it
in
those
cases.
nobody
is
an
absolute
guarantor
and
it
seems
to
us
that
frankly
on
a
case-to-case
basis,
there's
no
more
difficulty
in
proving
knowledge
or
a
state
of
mind
which
is
being
proved
everyday
as
we
know,
then
perhaps
approving
the
receiving
stolen
goods
and
knowing
that
the
goods
were
stolen.
there
are
problems
but
they
are
met
every
day
and
there
will
be
no
reason
why
on
the
case
by
case
basis,
it
could
not
be
just
as
successful.
and
finally,
if
it's
immoral
books
they
want,
if
it's
personal
wrongdoers
that
they
want,
they
should
go
after
them
and
not
make
statutes
so
wide
as
to
encompass
absolutely
innocent
persons
and
create
dangers
for
the
exercise
of
press
and
certainly
we
reserve
the
rest
of
our
time
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
wouldn't
know
off-hand.
i
thought
they
have
enough
-
i
really
don't
know,
(inaudible)
mr.
sam
rosenwein
oh
but
it's
not
in
the
record.
it's
not
in
the
record.
there
is
and
we
designate
if
he
had
asked
a
running
with
the
law
before
but
at
the
same
time
one
or
more
(inaudible)
i
would
like
to
say
this,
your
honor
that
in
los
angeles
perhaps
dealt
with
that
periodically
it
seems
to
be
every
three
or
four
years
the
police
go
through
the
department
stores
and
make
arrests
for
reasons
that
seems
to
take
up
but
i
think
if
you
were
to
look
into
the
history
of
los
angeles
see
that
every
three
years
there's
a
number
of
arrests
made
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
as
to
why
(inaudible)
i
don't
know,
but
on
this
record
and
this
may
not

nothing
is
available,
there's
no
record,
no
offense
or
felony

sitting
over
