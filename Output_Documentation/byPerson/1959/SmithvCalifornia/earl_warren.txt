eleazar
smith,
appellant,
versus
the
people
of
the
state
of
california.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fleishman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fleishman,
i
understood
justice
stewart
asked
you
if
there
is
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
the
character
of
the
other
books
in
this
bookshop.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rosenwein.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
arnebergh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
cite
that
as
there's
being
an
inference
against
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(inaudible)
in
his
favor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
we
concede
that
very
specifically.
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
primary
distinction
between
a
state
law
and
our
ordinances.
we
very
definitely
recognize
that.
and
the
dissent
was
based
upon
that
distinction
and
the
dissenting
judge
as
did
all
the
judges
specifically
found
that
the
book
was
obscene,
but
the
dissent
was
based
on
the
fact
that
we
could
not
make
a
more
restrictive
law
than
the
state
law
and
the
majority
held
to
the
contrary
and
of
course
that
is
binding
and
it's
been
a
question
of
state
law.
now
directing
our
question
to
this
distinction,
between
the
state
law
and
our
ordinance,
the
question
that's
definitely
presented
is
guilty
knowledge,
a
specific
intent,
a
necessary
element
of
a
law
prohibiting
the
sale
of
an
obscene
book.
now,
it's
well
established
that
the
state
may,
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
power,
provide
that
he
who
shall
do
a
prohibited
act,
so
do
it
at
his
peril
and
that
good
faith
or
ignorance
is
not
a
defense.
that's
the
first
time
that
was
specifically
before
this
court
i
believe
as
in
the
case
shevon
versus
carpenter,
a
minnesota
case
and
i
think
these
cases
are
pretty
well
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court.
it's
been
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
many,
many
instances.
it's
been
argued
here
that
the
buyer
may
select
the
book
himself
and
therefore
he
is
under
no
hazard,
but
of
course
we
also
have
laws
prohibiting
the
sale
of
narcotics
to
a
willing
buyer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
suppose
if
scienter
is
required
under
this
section,
it
wouldn't
be
required
under
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
religious
pamphlets
that
are
copyrighted?
could
they
be
proscribed
without
interfering
with
the
freedom
of
speech
in
religion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
could
be
proscribed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
if
it's
a
--
will
the
interest
of
the
public
be
the
same
whether
a
person
disseminated
the
filth
for
the
purpose
of
money
or
for
lust?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
the
same,
the
same
things
in
this
ordinance
for
instance
the
possession
of
it
in
any
toilet
or
restroom
open
to
the
public,
now
that
--
whether
that
is
for
lustful
purposes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
rather
than
commercial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
arnebergh
in
newspapers
daily
have
a
great
many
articles
that
are
copyrighted.
do
they
lose
their
protection
of
freedom
of
speech
so
far
those
articles
are
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
--
you
made
the
distinction.
you
said
they
have
two
rights.
they
have
the
right
of
freedom
for
the
press
and
they
have
also
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech.
now
if
that's
divisible,
do
they
lose
their
right
of
freedom
of
speech
so
far
as
the
newspaper
is
concerned
as
to
their
copyrighted
articles
or
are
they
on
a
different
--
some
different
basis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
congress
could
pass
a
law
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
say
there
is
no
more
issue
of
free
speech
if
he
wants
copyrights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
congress
could
do
it,
because
it's'
no
longer
free
speech
in
your
judgment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
it
has
--
would
this
--
would
this
book
be
obscene
under
section
311
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
--
of
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fleishman.
