but
if
these
have
not
been
copyrighted
this
would
have
to
reversed
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
you've
overlooked
the
argument
and
a
long
the
line
of
our
decisions
apparently
that
the
first
amendment
is
incorporated
at
least
in
part
in
the
fourteenth.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
we're
not
talking
about
the
fourteenth
--
the
fourteenth
of
course
is
the
only
one
applicable
here
in
california,
but
through
the
fourteenth
you've
reached
the
first.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
who
has
the
part
to
call
it
if
you're
selling
religious
literature
as
to
the
extent
any
of
alleged
exercise
as
far
as
the
religious
right
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
not
--
we're
not
talking
about
copyright.
this
is
just
where
they
were
selling
religious
tracts.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
they
were
selling
it
in
the
sense
of
getting
money
for
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
they
would
sell
it
as
ordinary
property.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
since
the
argument
was
made
in
that
case
up
and
it
came
to
what
you're
arguing
here
and
we've
rejected
them
in
both
religious
cases.
justice
william
o.
douglas
did
i
understand
you
to
say
you
had
a
bureau
of
censorship
in
los
angeles?
