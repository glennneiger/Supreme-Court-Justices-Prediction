mr.
roger
arnebergh
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
this
court,
if
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all
i
should
reply
to
one
or
two
points
that
have
been
made
here.
it's
stated
that
the
ordinance
would
result
in
closing
many
bookstores.
i
would
like
to
mention
and
the
record
shows
the
court's
taking
judicial
knowledge
over
these
municipal
courts.
that
this
ordinance
has
been
on
our
books
in
los
angeles
since
1939
and
it
has
not
been
amended
in
any
respect
that
affects
this,
and
we
still
have
the
great
many
bookstores
in
los
angeles.
with
respect
to
the
types
of
books
that
were
sold,
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
yes.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
an
option.
that
was
one
of
the
points
that
is
involved
in
the
state
is
whether
we
should
prosecute
under
state
law
or
a
municipal
order
--
ordinance
and
it
was
held
at
--
we
have
the
right
to
prosecute
under
either
as
our
municipal
ordinance
is
more
restricted
than
the
state
law
which
under
our
california
constitution
within
a
chartered
city
we
have
the
right
to
do.
with
respect
to
the
type
of
books,
i
would
like
to
state
first
this
bookstore
did
have
all
types
of
books,
but
the
significant
thing
is
that
as
shown
on
pages
35
and
36
of
the
transcript
of
record
this
particular
book
and
others
--
well
this
particular
book
was
segregated
in
a
section
that
juveniles
were
not
allowed
to
enter
and
that
the
first
duty
of
one
of
his
clerks
was
to
keep
juveniles
away
from
this
particular
section.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
no,
i'm
merely
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
i
merely
cited
it
in
answer
to
a
question
that
was
asked
and
justice
stewart
asked
of
counsel.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
--
but
because
the
buyer
can
read
the
book
but
will
be
recognized
among
the
legislative
intents
was
that
of
protecting
not
only
the
buyer,
but
also
society
from
the
evil
of
the
flow
of
obscene
matters.
the
principle
that
knowledge
is
not
required
is
again
reaffirmed
in
the
significant
case,
united
states
versus
balint
and
i'd
like
to
read
a
bit
from
that
if
i
might
because
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
--
that
case
involved
the
unlawful
selling
of
opium.
now
the
lower
court
had
sustained
the
demurrer
because
the
complaint
did
not
charge
specific
knowledge.
and
the
--
this
court
reversed
the
lower
court
and
stated
that
knowledge
was
an
element
in
this
type
of
case,
it
was
a
question
of
legislative
intent
and
that
the
legislative
intent
had
been
clearly
demonstrated
that
knowledge
was
not
required,
then
knowledge
was
not
necessary.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
yes
mr.
justice.
there's
a
great
many.
it's
a
very
broad
field,
your
pure
food
and
drug
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
oh,
pardon
me.
that
i
could
not
answer.
i
know
there
are
others
in
addition
to
ours,
but
i
don't
know
how
many
there
are.
i
would
not
be
in
the
position
to
state
that.
the
matter
was
discussed
at
the
recent
convention
of
nimlo
which
the
national
institute
of
municipal
law
officers
which
just
took
place
last
week
and
i
might
state
this
was
the
major
problem
with
which
we
were
all
concerned.
and
i
know
that
there
are
the
cities
that
had
such
an
ordinance,
it
was
discovered
there,
but
i
couldn't
say
specifically
how
many
do,
or
how
many
do
not.
as
an
indication
of
the
broad
field
to
which
this
thing
--
this
has
been
applied,
this
principle
that
you
do
not
need
to
have
specific
knowledge
is
the
case
of
williams
versus
north
carolina.
that
involved
a
--
the
validity
of
a
divorce
and
a
bigamy
prosecution
and
in
that
case,
the
court
stated
“a
man's
faith
often
depends
as
for
instance
in
the
enforcement
of
the
sherman
law
on
far
greater
risks
that
he
will
estimate
rightly.
that
is,
as
the
jury
subsequently
estimates
it
to
some
matter
of
degree.
if
his
judgment
is
wrong,
not
only
may
he
incur
a
fine
or
a
short
imprisonment
as
here,
he
may
incur
the
punishment
of
death.”
mr.
roger
arnebergh
i
think
it
is
relevant
in
this
respect
that
it
shows
that
absent
–
it
shows
that
there
is
one
step
along
the
way.
it
shows
that
guilty
knowledge
is
not
required.
now,
in
answer
to
your
specific
question,
you
have
a
directly
analogous
situation
in
connection
with
your
pure
food
and
drug
act
and
things
of
that
nature
and
in
the
case
of
dotterweich
for
example
320
u.s.
277,
it
was
specifically
held
there
that
an
officer
of
the
corporation
who
had
been
convicted,
that
conviction
could
be
sustained
although
he
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
the
matter
at
all.
in
that
case,
this
court
stated
“the
now
familiar
type
of
legislation
whereby
penalty
served
as
effective
means
of
regulation
such
legislation
dispenses
with
the
conventional
requirement
of
criminal
conduct,
awareness
of
wrong
doing.
in
the
instance
of
the
larger
good,
it
puts
the
burden
of
acting
as
hazard
upon
a
person
otherwise
innocent,
but
standing
in
a
responsible
relationship
to
the
buyer
or
to
the
public
danger,
pardon
me.”
now,
my
contention
is
--
our
contention
is
that
here,
you
have
a
person
who
stands
in
a
responsible
relationship
to
a
public
danger
that
of
the
indiscriminate
distribution
of
obscenity.
and
the
same
principle
is
of
course
then
applied
to
short
wake
and
to
numerous
other
matters
such
as
billing
and
safety,
zoning
and
things
of
that
nature.
the
principle
that
guilty
knowledge
is
not
a
necessary
element
in
a
--
to
hold
a
person
criminally
liable
for
a
violation
of
law,
has
been
sustained
in
cases
involving
constitutional
rights
in
addition
to
those
of
the
fourteen
amendment
which
of
course
protected,
in
this
case.
for
example,
the
first
right
mentioned
in
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
is
that
of
a
freedom
of
religion.
but
yet
in
the
reynolds
case,
here
a
conviction
of
bigamy
was
sustained
despite
the
fact
that
the
defense
was
that
he
thought
he
was
doing
right,
and
it
was
one
of
the
principles
of
his
religion
and
with
respect
to
the
second
amendment.
the
second
amendment
provides
that
the
person's
right
to
carry
and
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed.
yet,
we
have
laws
with
respect
to
carrying
concealed
weapons
or
even
possession
of
certain
types
of
weapons
such
as
machine
guns.
he
may
have
no
knowledge
of
the
law,
but
he's
guilty
nevertheless.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
well,
it
is
a
question
of
him
having
knowledge
that
the
thing
that
he
sold
was
in
violation
of
the
law.
in
other
words,
he
knows
that
he
sold
a
book.
he
had
a
book
and
he
knows
that
he
sold
the
book.
now,
the
question
that
comes
up,
do
we
have
the
right
to
require
him
to
know
what
he
is
selling,
or
can
he
sell
anything
that
he
wants
indiscriminately
on
the
basis
he
didn't
know
what
it
was.
that
is
the
question.
how
far
can
the
city
or
can
the
state
or
have
the
public
go
in
protecting
itself
from
this
sort
of
activity.
in
other
words
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
the
state
law
does,
our
law
does
not.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
the
ordinance
does
not.
in
other
words,
this
presents
the
question
referring
to
--
to
food
and
drug
as
the
closest
analogy.
is
it
more
important
for
society
to
protect
the
well-being,
of
the
physical
well-being
of
its
members
or
the
mental
well-being
of
its
members
or
as
bishop
fulton
sheen
recently
expressed
it,
“why
should
we
not
keep
poison
away
from
minds
as
we
keep
it
away
from
stomachs?”
on
considering
this
question
it's
important
to
recognize
that
probably
50%
or
more
of
our
mental
--
our
hospitals
are
now
occupied
by
cases
from
mental
disturbances
to
some
kind
or
another.
and
believe
me
it's
far
easier
to
pump
poison
from
the
stomach
than
poison
from
a
mind.
obscenity
may
affect
the
hearts
and
minds
in
a
way
never
to
be
undone.
unfortunately,
by
the
case
of
brown
versus
board
of
education
of
topeka,
it
has
now
been
clearly
established
that
that
which
affects
the
hearts
and
minds
of
its
people
is
just
as
much
a
matter
of
concern
to
the
state
as
that
which
affects
their
bodies.
now,
of
course
the
problem
presented
in
this
case
far
transcends
the
importance
of
the
evil
that
that
particular
book
might
do.
the
defendant
here
as
in
all
similar
cases,
contends
that
he
doesn't
know
what
he
sells.
that
he
doesn't
read
the
books
that
he
handles,
that
his
business
is
so
big
that
he
couldn't
possibly
read
all
of
the
books
that
he
sells.
is
bigness
a
defense?
if
we
had
to
prove
that
the
defendant
knew
that
the
book
that
he
sold
was
obscene
then
he
would
be
setting
the
standard,
not
the
community,
not
the
average
person.
to
be
the
law
that
bigness
is
a
defense,
that
he
doesn't
have
to
read,
he
doesn't
--
if
he
hasn't
read
it.
he
doesn't
know
what
it
is.
he's
not
liable?
then
the
bigger
the
dealer,
the
less
responsible
that
you
would
have,
while
a
small
dealer,
could
probably
be
reasonably
required
to
have
read
the
three
or
four
books
that
he
might
handle.
if
this
be
the
--
if
this
be
the
defense,
then
the
very
same
defense
would
be
available
to
every
large
dealer
regardless
of
how
vile,
how
contaminated,
how
filthy
the
material
that
he
would
handle.
i
can
not
believe
that
it
is
the
law
that
bigness,
mere
bigness
is
a
defense
because
it
prohibits
--
so
--
his
business
is
so
large
that
the
man
can't
know
what
he's
doing.
he
has
to
have
the
responsibility.
these
same
arguments
were
made
at
the
beginning
of
the
pure
food
and
drug
act
and
it
was
said
that
nobody
would
dare
to
handle
pure
food
but
we
still
have
--
we
still
have
foods
stores.
the
only
difference
is
that
now,
the
food
that
they
sell
is
pure.
now,
free
speech
has
been
very
much
discussed
in
this
case,
but
does
an
ordinance
which
makes
it
illegal
for
a
bookseller
to
possess
or
sell
an
obscene
book
really
involve
free
speech?
the
quick
answer
of
course
is
that
obscenity
is
not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
speech
of
the
press,
but
the
importance
of
the
overall
problem
is
such
that
i
don't
think
we
should
stop
here.
the
commercial
exploitation
of
the
morbid
and
shameful
craving
for
materials
with
prurient
effect
requires
that
we
go
beyond
this.
and
in
studying
the
various
cases
dealing
with
free
speech
and
the
difference
--
different
opinions,
i've
tried
awfully
hard
to
try
to
reconcile
what
is
the
underlying
cause
of
it
all.
the
nebulous
principle
of
law
that
would
reconcile
them
all
them
together
because
i'm
sure
all
the
decisions,
all
the
different
opinions
are
striving
for
the
same
thing
that
we're
striving
for,
that
of
protecting
free
speech
without
licensing
obscenity.
and
i'm
unwilling
to
accept
the
premise
that
this
cannot
be
done,
that
there
is
necessarily
any
inherent
conflict
between
our
objectives
of
preserving
free
speech,
and
preventing
commercial
exploitation
of
obscenity.
so
i
really
put
--
so
i
went
back
and
did
a
lot
of
reviewing
even
since
our
brief
was
written,
we
are
then
so
close
to
the
case
that
we
probably
didn't
look
at
the
cause
for
the
trees
and
this
--
and
in
this
connection
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
yes.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
the
ordinance
specifies
the
places
at
which
possession
is
illegal,
and
of
course
we
are
here
concerned
with
a
situation
where
a
man
possessed
it
in
a
place
where
the
books
were
sold.
now,
if
you
read
all
of
the
sections
of
the
ordinance,
the
purpose
of
it
is,
to
keep
it
out
of
possession
of
places
where
either
at
the
--
with
the
commercially
exploited
as
here,
or
where
it
could
serve
as
an
immediate
inducement
to
an
obscene
act
that
the
book
might
stimulate.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
if
it
were
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
if
it
were
to
be
construed
as
shall
i
say,
technically
or
closely
as
that,
i
could
state
this,
as
a
city
attorney,
we
have
never
construed
in
that
manner.
we
--
i've
always
construed
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
there's
no
exception.
it
would
be
a
matter
of
--
a
matter
of
shall
i
say
discretion
in
--
and
i'm
sure
that
the
courts
would
read
into
it
as
they
have
in
many
other
laws,
reasonableness
there.
but
anyway,
we
are
here
concerned
with
--
we
are
hereby
concerned
with
subsection
two,
if
i
recall
the
correct
subsection,
and
which
has
to
do
with
having
it
in
a
place
wherein
--
in
its
possession,
in
a
place
where
books
are
sold
or
selling
it.
and
if
the
other
subsections
are
bad,
that
is
a
matter
that
isn't
vital
to
this
case
but
as
i
stated
the
enforcement
policy
has
never
been
to
do
other
than
try
to
obtain
its
objectives.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
no.
but
it
might
well
be
that
you
--
that
of
course,
it's
merely
the
possession
of
an
obscene
work
might
--
might
not
be
reasonable.
i
don't
know.
i'm
not
prepared
to
argue
that
at
this
time
because
i
haven't
analyzed
all
of
the
cases
involving
that
and
it
is
not
involved
in
this
because
in
this
particular
subsection,
it's
a
commercial
exploitation
and
that
i
think
is
a
key
to
the
whole
problem.
in
this
connection,
it's
interesting
to
briefly
review
the
--
shall
i
say
the
cases
that
are
the
landmarks
on
the
path
of
free
speech.
from
the
very
beginning,
the
cases
have
involved
the
speech
of
the
defendant
who
was
attempting
to
personally
organize
or
personally
carry
a
banner
or
personally
picket.
for
example,
herndon
versus
lowry,
that
involved
this
personal
speech
of
the
defendant
who
was
attempting
to
organize.
watkins
versus
united
states
involved
the
right
of
the
defendant
to,
with
respect
to
his
taking
an
oath.
sweezy
versus
new
hampshire
involved
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
personally
refuse
to
answer
questions.
hague
versus
committee
for
industrial
welfare
involved
the
right
to
have
an
injunction
to
prohibit
the
plaintiff
--
the
plaintiff
in
the
injunction
case
hague,
the
injunction
to
restrain
him
from
exercising
his
personal
rights
to
distribute
handbills
setting
forth
his
personal
views
and
helvering
versus
leonard,
involved
in
anti-picketing
ordinance.
defendant
was
personally
picketing
and
he
was
arrested.
in
carlson
versus
state
of
california
involved
an
ordinance
prohibiting
display
of
banners
by
pickets
and
the
defendant
was
personally
picketing
and
personally
carrying
a
banner.
in
bridges
versus
california,
a
contempt
case,
involved
a
letter
or
telegram
that
bridges
had
personally
sent.
and
the
times
mirror,
the
other
defendant,
involved
an
editorial
personally
put
in
their
paper.
now,
there's
too
a
great
distinction
between
the
exercise
of
free
speech
and
engaging
in
commercial
activities.
schneider
versus
irvington
involved
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
personally
distribute
handbills
in
the
street.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
it
has
never
been
so
construed
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
reasonable
to
construe
in
that
manner.
now,
what
we're
concerned
with
here
and
this
is
the
crux
of
the
whole
thing,
we
are
concerned
as
is
--
i
think
every
city
in
the
country
with
the
controlling
the
commercial
exploitation
of
obscenity.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
if
the
ordinance
should
be
redrafted,
that's
one
thing
but
the
point
of
it
much
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
well,
we
think
that
it
does
by
our
construction
of
it,
we
think
that
it
does,
but
it
--
but
it
is
possible
to
read
so
it
does
not.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
we
do
not
have
any
state
court
decision
where
we
have
--
or
any
--
we
have
never
prosecuted
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
and
i've
been
in
the
--
i
was
in
the
criminal
division
since
1941
and
i've
been
city
attorney
since
1953.
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
we
have
never
prosecuted
under
section
2
anybody
other
than
the
owner
or
possibly
the
clerk
who
was
actually
selling
in
what
was
actual
sale
made
and
that
is
the
way
that
we
would
administer
it.
now,
if
it's
too
broad
in
its
terms
that
of
course
is
relatively
a
minor
matter.
this
particular
defendant
in
this
particular
case
isn't
our
major
problem.
our
major
problem
is
getting
some
decision
should
we
say
or
an
opinion
that
can
enable
us
to
fully
protect
free
speech
and
at
the
same
time
stop
the
commercial
exploitation
of
obscenity.
that's
what
we're
--
that's
the
reason
that
we're
here.
that's
the
thing
we're
concerned
about
and
of
course,
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
commercial
exploitation.
as
i
started
to
say
about
this
case
in
new
york,
they
prohibited
the
distribution
of
handbills
and
the
court
stated
that
they
couldn't
do
this
but
they
clearly
recognized
the
distinction
stating,
“we
are
not
to
be
taken
as
holding
that
commercial
soliciting
and
canvassing
may
not
be
subjected
to
such
regulations
as
the
ordinance
may
require.”
it
was
the
prohibiting
of
passing
out
handbills
setting
forth
a
person's
personal
views
that
was
unconstitutional
and
there're
been
many
distinctions
between
the
commercial
activity
and
this
free
speech.
that's
stressed
in
--
now
in
the
valentine
case
but
--
and
these
various
other
cases,
packer
corporation
versus
utah,
fifth
avenue
coach
company
where
they
prohibited
display
advertising
on
the
side
of
buses
and
all
of
its
stores.
from
this
--
from
these
cases,
it
would
be
seen
that
it
is
the
personal
right
of
defendant
to
personally
exercise
his
free
speech
that
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
further
it
is
clear
that
free
speech
is
distinguishable
from
commercial
activity
and
this
is
the
key
to
the
whole
solution,
as
our
problem
is
not
with
those
who
wish
to
personally
express
their
ideas,
their
views
or
their
opinions.
there
be
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
well
of
course,
i
--
i
will
defer
that
if
i
may,
but
i
--
with
respect
to
newspapers,
basically
of
course
you
have
free
press
and
free
speech
and
they
have
the
benefit
of
both.
but
with
respect
to
free
speech,
that
which
is
commercially
exploited
as
in
this
case
copyrighted,
you
have
an
entirely
different
situation
resulting.
i
have
the
right
to
go
on
the
street
and
express
my
views,
but
whereas
in
this
case,
the
defendant
was
selling
a
book
that
he
contended
he'd
never
had
read.
he
certainly
wasn't
expressing
any
opinions
or
views
or
beliefs.
he
wasn't
even
enough
interested
in
it
to
read
the
book.
all
he
was
interested
in
was
a
commercial
activity
of
selling
a
book.
now,
how
can
his
free
speech
be
involved?
mr.
roger
arnebergh
i
suppose
free
speech
without
the
right
to
be
heard
would
be
meaningless
and
--
and
consequently,
i
would
say
if
there
would
have
any
free
speech
involved
here
that
was
violated,
it
was
not
the
defendant
because
it
wasn't
what
he
said
that
we
are
here
to
engage
with.
it
was
with
somebody
else
it
said.
now
if
anybody's
free
speech
was
involved,
it
was
the
author's,
but
the
answer
to
that
is
this.
the
author
had
copyrighted
the
book.
he
had
sold
the
copyright
to
the
publisher
and
the
two,
between
copyright
and
free
speech
are
totally
inimical.
in
other
words,
when
you
copyright
something,
you
deprive
the
public
of
the
right
to
it,
unless
they
pay
you
a
benefit.
freedom
of
speech
is
the
right
to
express
an
idea,
an
opinion,
a
belief.
you
can't
copyright
any
of
those.
you
can't
copyright
an
idea,
an
opinion
or
a
belief.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
oh,
that's
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
in
my
opinion
and
i
could
be
wrong,
but
i'm
trying
to
reconcile
the
problem
we're
confronted
here,
i
think
that
when
you
copyright
something,
you
have
changed
its
nature
from
that
of
free
speech
to
property.
the
very
function
of
a
copyright
is
to
acquire
a
property
right
in
what
you've
said,
as
distinguished
from
the
material
book
itself
and
where
you
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
the
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
that's
true,
but
they
weren't
copyrighted.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
my
point
is
this.
i
think
that
first
of
all
in
this
case,
we
were
dealing
with
the
free
speech
of
the
defendant.
that
he
is
the
one
who's
charged
and
his
free
speech
was
not
in
anyway
violated
because
he
wouldn't
even
read
what
he
was
selling.
to
him,
he
was
selling
a
piece
of
property.
now
that
as
to
whether
or
not
we
were
violating
anybody
else's
free
speech,
we'd
get
into
collateral
question,
“did
we
violate
the
author's
free
speech?”
and
the
answer
to
that
in
my
opinion
is
no
because
the
book
was
copyrighted
and
then
the
author
had
sold
the
copyright
to
the
publisher
and
the
publisher
held
the
copyright.
and
--
and
furthermore,
under
the
law
as
frequently
expressed
by
this
and
other
courts
when
you
copyright
something
you
acquire
a
property
right
in
it,
and
you
are
then
dealing
with
property.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
it's
still
a
book.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
now
on
that
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
i
wanted
this
--
to
the
very
effect.
that
there
is
this
great
--
there
is
a
distinct
distinction
between
the
fact
that
free
speech
does
not
include
obscenity.
that
is
one
separate
point.
now
i'm
trying
to
--
and
my
reason
i'm
bringing
this
other
as
a
separate
in
collateral
justification
or
basis
where
this
is
that
i
feel
that
in
--
if
we
will
recognize
the
basic
principles
of
free
speech,
the
right
to
express
an
opinion,
idea
or
a
belief
and
we
will
recognize
the
distinction
between
that
which
is
property
and
that
which
is
free
speech
we
can
reconcile
all
the
differences
in
opinions
that
we
have
here
because
we
will
in
no
way
infringe
upon
a
man's
right
to
do
that
thing
which
was
protected
and
we
have
--
he
has
a
fully
protected
constitutional
right
if
he
wants
to
--
to
make
it
property,
to
change
his
speech
to
property
and
sell
it
for
commercial
exploitation.
if
he
doesn't
want
to
commercially
exploit,
we
have
no
problem.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
he
hasn't
copyrighted
that.
he
hasn't
made
that
property.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
if
he
copyrights
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
if
he
has
the
right
to
repeat
that
and
he
repeats
it
then
it
sure
must
be
his
free
speech
involved,
but
this
man
wasn't
free
of
anything.
he
was
just
selling
a
book
that
he'd
never
even
read
and
didn't
know.
however,
to
answer
your
question
head
on,
i
personally
feel
after
a
study
of
all
these
cases
and
i
recognize
that
it's
--
it's
a
further
exploration
of
it,
but
i've
done
it
in
an
effort
to
try
to
reconcile
all
of
our
problems
here
so
we
can
get
some
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
it
certainly
is.
it's
one
--
it's
well
worth
the
--
the
spending
considerable
time
which
i've
endeavored
to
do
and
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
if
they
are
copyrighted
and
then
reduced
to
property,
i
would
say
that
the
same
thing
would
undoubtedly
apply.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
only
--
well,
without
interfering
with
the
first
amendment,
you
still
have
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
he
has
the
constitutionally
protected
right
in
either
case.
and
the
--
and
the
difference
is
this,
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
of
due
process
and
not
taking
property
from
somebody
without
due
process,
the
ownership
of
property
including
the
ownership
of
the
copyright
piece
of
property
involves
the
right
to
use
it
for
gain
--
to
use
it
gainfully
and
that
of
course
involves
the
right
to
sell
it.
the
difference
being
that
that
case
the
state
has,
or
shall
i
say
a
somewhat
different
situation,
we
then,
are
not
quite
as
--
we
can
do
that
then
should
i
say
which
is
reasonably
required
in
the
public
interest.
we
can
like
for
example
let's
say
by
analogy
to
his
own
in-law
where
you
--
a
man
owns
his
property.
he
has
the
right
to
use
that
property,
but
we
can
only
restrict
the
use
to
that
which
is
reasonably
required
for
the
public
benefit.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
well,
certainly
because
there
was
no
--
there
could
be
no
reasonable
basis
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
why
we
could
prohibit
a
man
from
selling
that
piece
of
property.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
anymore
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
well,
i
think
it's
a
little
bit
broader
than
that.
that's
the
point.
i
think
that
that
would
give
a
little
bit
broader
application
to
the
power
of
cities
and
states
to
cope
with
their
particular
localized
problems
just
as
we
have
with
zoning.
we
have
certain
particular
problems
that
we
have
to
cope
with
locally,
but
we
have
to
be
reasonable
in
our
application.
applying
your
end
--
in
your
--
your
situation
or
your
hypothetical
question
to
a
zoning
situation,
obviously
we
couldn't
prohibit
anybody
from
leasing,
renting
or
selling
property
to
any
member
of
one
party.
you
see,
there
is
an
adequate
protection
here
and
it
would
solve
our
problem
and
it
would
solve
the
problem
that
we're
here
confronted
with.
we're
only
here
confronted
with
the
commercial
exploitation
of
this
sort
of
thing
and
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
we
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
well,
i
think
under
the
albert's
case
we
have
--
we
have
already
decided
on
just
straight
obscenity
but
i'm
talking
about
probably
some
of
these
problems
we've
got
into,
questions
of
what
is
obscene
and
there's
difference
of
opinion
here,
there
and
elsewhere.
i
think
that
if
we
will
apply
the
standard
which
i
think
should
be
properly
applied,
giving
recognition
to
the
sovereignty
of
states
and
the
sovereignty
of
cities
under
charter
a
home
rule
and
so
forth,
that
we
have
the
fourteenth
amendment
rather
than
the
first
amendment
there
and
consequently,
we
--
they
can
shall
we
say
adopt
such
standards
as
are
reasonably
necessary
for
the
sale
of
property.
now
if
it's
--
if
it's
with
respect
to
somebody
expressing,
and
again
i
want
to
emphasize
this,
if
they're
exercising
their
free
speech,
if
they're
talking
about
what
they
believe
or
they're
in
a
street
corner
and
they're
expressing
their
views
or
they're
in
a
public
park,
or
handing
out
the
pamphlets
or
carrying
a
banner
or
picketing,
these
things
aren't
in
anyway
interfered
with.
the
only
thing
of
it
is,
is
when
a
man
reduces
it
to
a
piece
of
property
which
he
does
by
virtue
with
the
very
provisions
of
the
copyright
laws
as
construed
by
this
and
every
other
court,
when
he
does
this,
then
he
had
by
voluntarily,
by
his
own
act,
not
by
your
act
or
my
act
but
by
his
voluntarily
act,
he
has
said,
“i
am
more
interested
in
making
money
than
i
am
in
expressing
my
views.”
mr.
roger
arnebergh
now,
if
this
or
that'd
been
copyrighted,
it
would
stand
on
the
basis
of
this
obscenity
not
being
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
free
speech
and
free
press.
so
in
this
case,
it
would
not
have
to
be
reversed
at
all.
possibly,
i
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
that
is
precisely
my
point.
and
the
reason
for
it
is,
that
these
people
who
were
trying
to
make
money
out
of
filth,
they're
only
interested
in
making
money.
they're
not
interested
in
expressing
ideas,
opinions,
or
beliefs.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
it
is
and
he
has
the
full
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
he
sells
that
too.
the
only
thing
i
was
stating,
if
--
when
it's
copyrighted
you
have
by
that
nature
changed
it
completely
from
free
speech
to
property,
and
as
property
the
bookseller
of
course,
it's
his
property.
he
has
the
right
to
sell
it.
if
it
can
be
sold
without
unnecessarily
--
i
mean,
let
me,
let
me
turn
that
around
to
express
it
more
clearly.
the
state
can
only
restrict
the
sale
of
that
book
if
it
is
reasonably
necessary
to
do
so
in
the
public
interest
which
is
a
somewhat
broad
field
of
regulation
than
free
speech.
and
consequently
we
can't
arbitrarily
deprive
a
bookseller
selling
his
property
or
any
other
property
whether
it's
copyrighted
or
not.
if
it's
copyrighted,
he
still
has
its
full
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
that
wouldn't
be
true,
but
the
problem
is
not
there
because
the
--
we
have
no
problem
with
people.
i
mean,
it
isn't
a
national
problem
like
this
commercial
exploitation
that
we're
concerned
about.
it
is
this,
this
desire
to
--
as
you
so
ably
expressed
it
in
--
in
the
albert's
case
--
that
commercial
exploitation.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
that
--
that
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
that
is
there.
that's
right.
that
different
a
section
of
it
and
that's
what
i
endeavor
to
indicate
in
answering
the
previous
question.
if
that
was
because
in
this
particular
place
that
it
gave
rise
to
shall
we
say
the
current
present
danger
of
it
being
a
stimulation
to
unlawful
acts.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
i
would
say
this.
that
certainly
the
defendant's
personal
free
speech
is
involved
if
what
he
is
passing
on
is
that
which
is
his
speech.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
yes,
and
--
and
then
assuming
now
that
he
had
not
reduced
that
to
property
by
copyrighting
it
which
was
his
option.
he
has
the
election.
he
can
either
have
it
be
free
speech
or
he
can
have
via
property
right.
and
if
he
has
not
copyrighted
it
is
obviously
his
free
speech
and
he
is
fully
protected
by
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
oh,
absolutely.
i
failed
to
make
myself
clear.
the
bookseller
has
an
absolute
property
right
in
these
books
and
he's
fully
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
whether
they're
copyrighted
or
not.
but
if
they
are
copyrighted,
they
are
property,
not
speech,
not
freedom
of
speech.
consequently,
they're
deemed
property,
he
then
has
the
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
surely
and
we
cannot
deprive
him
of
the
right
to
sell
that
unless
we
can
show
that
to
do
so
it
is
reasonably
required
for
the
public
welfare.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
no
your
--
i
have
it
--
i
have
it
in
your
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
yes,
i
recognize
that
full
well
justice
douglas,
but
the
point
is
this
that
this
court
has
never
decided
to
the
best
of
my
ability
to
research
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
free
speech
is
involved
when
there
is
a
copyright
and
the
author
has
by
his
personal
election,
decided
to
change
that
which
he
said
from
the
expression
of
an
idea,
an
opinion,
or
a
belief
and
decided
to
change
to
a
property
right
in
which
he
is
given
by
law
of
a
monopoly
and
the
exclusive
right
to
determine
how
many
times
if
it
all,
it
will
be
repeated.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
certainly,
there's
property
right
there.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
but
i
don't
believe
that's
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
i'm
fully
cognizant
of
that,
but
when
i'm
--
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
has
ever
been
asked
to
determine
the
kind
of
question
that
i
am
now
pulling
and
i
have
to
say
but
that
i
discussed
it
at
nimlo
and
i
think
it
was
unique
to
all
the
attorneys
there,
maybe
it's
completely
out
if
i
didn't
so.
i
do
not
see
where
it
falls
down.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
well,
dissemination
of
news
is
of
course
--
news
is
of
something
that
can't
be
copyrighted.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
i
would
say
that
as
for
a
copyright
and
it
either
is
the
law
or
isn't
the
law
and
--
and
if
it
is
the
law
that
when
you
copyright,
it
becomes
property
then
as
to
the
copyrighted
articles
they
have
property
and
that
that
is
so
is
the
fact
that
anybody
can
be
sued
for
plagiarizing
what
the
newspaper
or
anyone
of
these
copyrighted
columnists,
that's
property.
that's
not
a
free
speech,
but
if
i
hear
a
man
expressing
an
opinion
or
a
view,
i
can
go
next
door
and
express
that
opinion
or
view.
the
purpose
of
expression
and
an
opinion
or
a
view
i
believe
is
to
try
to
get
other
people
to
accept
it
and
yet
here
if
i
accept
this
column
and
then
repeat
it,
i
can
be
sued.
isn't
that
a
clear
indication
that
he
by
his
voluntarily
act
has
changed
the
character
and
the
nature
of
what
he
has
done
from
that
of
the
right
of
free
speech
to
that
of
property?
mr.
roger
arnebergh
no,
congress
could
not
a
pass
a
law
depriving
us
of
freedom
of
speech,
but
this
man
has
elected
to
do
this.
he
has
his
free
speech.
i
have
property.
i
have
rights.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
that's
right.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
well,
i
misunderstood
your
question
mr.
chief
justice.
my
point
is
that
the
congress
could
not
deprive
a
man
of
free
speech,
but
congress
can
say,
you
have
the
right
to
exercise
free
speech
or
you
have
the
right
to
reduce
it
to
property
and
they
couldn't
take
his
right
from
him,
but
he
had
by
his
own
voluntary
act,
he
elected
to
say
i
am
more
interested
in
money
than
i
am
in
expressing
views
and
that
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
that's
right.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
no,
i
don't
say
that.
i
state
this.
i
state
that
if
you
decide
to
engage
in
a
commercial
activity,
you
do
not
necessarily
have
the
full
protection
that
you
have
if
you
are
a
crusader
or
if
you're
designed
to
express
a
view,
opinion
or
belief.
it's
totally
unnecessary.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
well,
i
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
have
the
right
to
express
a
view
or
not
a
view.
if
i'll
have
a
view,
an
opinion
or
a
belief
i
have
the
right
to
express
it
or
not
to
express
it.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
that's
right.
i
only
have
the
right
though,
in
the
event
they
choose
to
give
me
the
benefit.
free
speech
is
for
the
purpose
of
giving
to
the
world
freely
an
idea,
or
a
belief,
or
opinion.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
well,
that's
--
that's
where
we
come
to
--
where
i
feel
differently.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
a
--
or
the
--
i
want
to
get
back
again
--
the
person
who
has
the
idea
has
the
right
to
express
them.
he
doesn't
have
to
express
the
idea.
no
law
can
make
him
express
it.
if
we
need
to
know,
a
man
can't
take
an
oath
or
is
not
required
to
take
an
oath.
he
can't
be
required.
consequently,
if
i
have
an
idea,
i
have
the
right
to
express
the
idea
or
i
have
the
right
to
say,
“i'll
make
money
off
the
idea.”
and
if
i
elect
to
say,
“i
will
make
that
idea
property,
not
free
speech”
it's
my
election.
if
i
want
to
make
it
an
idea
i
can
make
it
an
idea.
now
the
fact
that
i
make
it
property
does
not
mean
that
there's
any
less
an
idea
there
that's
true.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
well
as
i
stated
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
and
not
--
not
the
sale
of
it.
it's
one
--
one
of
the
person's
rights.
now
i
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
much
--
much
shall
i
say
religious
literature
that
has
been
copyrighted.
most
of
the
people
that
i
know
were
only
too
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
then
they
have
an
absolute
right
to
do
it
because
it
hasn't
been
reduced
to
property.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
but
i
would
as
well,
but
they're
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
well
that
--
that
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
well
--
well
i
--
i
apparently
haven't
made
my
full
thoughts
clear.
my
thought
is
this
that
as
to
this
particular
defendant
in
this
particular
case,
his
free
speech
was
not
violated
because
he
testified
that
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
selling,
he
was
merely
selling
a
book,
he
had
so
many
books,
he
had
so
--
and
shows
and
so
forth
that
he
couldn't
possibly
read
them.
so
he
was
just
selling.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
the
freedom
of
the
press
as
i
understand
it
is
basically
a
prior
restraint.
in
other
words
these
taxes
or
these
cases
for
example
where
they
put
a
tax
on,
on
a
circulation
or
things
of
that
nature.
and
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
and
--
and
then
when
you
couple
with
that
freedom
of
speech
and
then
you
have
the
right
to
disseminate
your
news,
your
information,
your
ideas,
your
opinions,
your
beliefs.
but
i
just
wanted
it
clear
that
it
is
my
opinion
is,
the
quick
answer
as
i
stated
initially
is
that
the
book
is
obscene
and
therefore
not
in
the
area,
but
in
order
to
try
and
reconcile
all
of
these
conflicting
opinions
and
this
forces
them
to
give
a
working
standard
to
all
us
i
felt
it
was
my
duty
to
express
to
you
my
views
in
the
matter
which
--
which
i
feel
would
solve
the
entire
problem
if
they
were
adopted
because
it
is
only
this
commercial
exploitation
of
filth
that
is
put
in
the
country
today,
and
you
wouldn't
have
the
problem
because
if
there
wasn't
money
to
be
made,
it
wouldn't
be
written,
that
it
wouldn't
be
distributed
and
it
wouldn't
be
sold.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
and
we
would
simply
have
the
fourteenth
amendment,
where
is
the
reasonable
necessity
that
a
public
welfare
requires
the
barring
of
it.
just
as
my
property
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
the
same
people
who
can
decide
whether
or
not
i
can
use
my
property
for
a
business
purpose
or
a
residential
purpose.
it's
a
constitutionally
protected
right
that
they
can
go
right
to
this
court
and
it
has
to
be
you.
and
now
with
respect
to
the
question
obscenity,
even
if
we
ignore
the
basic
distinction
between
free
speech
and
copyrighted
property,
the
book
in
question
is
obviously
obscene.
and
therefore
as
i
mentioned
i
was
in
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
speech
or
press.
as
the
appellate
court
stated,
under
any
test,
the
book
concerned
in
this
prosecution
was
properly
held
to
be
obscene
by
the
trial
court
and
we
share
such
a
conclusion
upon
our
independent
view
of
the
evidence.
it
should
be
recognized
that
in
this
case
as
was
mentioned
by
counsel
there
is
no
conflict
in
the
evidence
and
further
the
court
stated,
we
reach
the
conclusion
also
when
we
have
considered
the
book
as
a
whole
under
tests
that
the
appellant
contends
are
applicable.
now
this
court
has
expressed
the
standards
that
should
be
followed
in
determining
obscenity.
first
of
all
the
average
person,
but
may
i
state
that
i
do
not
consider
a
book
critique
necessarily
be
average
person
and
the
mere
fact
that
something
has
a
sale
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
average
person
acts
within
his
standards
or
that
--
that
it
won't
have
any
effect
on
him.
first
of
all,
the
average
person
never
buys
all
of
the
books.
i
mean
you
talk
about
the
sale
of
a
million
books,
well
how
million
people
are
there
in
the
country?
it's
a
very
small
percentage,
a
small
fraction
of
the
people.
so
that's
no
proof.
the
fact
that
books
of
an
obscene
nature
or
suggestive
or
so
on,
that
this
particular
book
sold
and
it
had
some
passages
in
it
that
were
not
delicately
expressed.
then
applying
contemporary
community
standards,
well
again,
i
don't
think
we'd
go
out
looking
for
trouble.
it's
when
we
receive
a
flood
of
protests
from
organizations
of
people
who
are
concerned
about
the
community
standards
and
they
are
the
ones
who
set
the
community
standards.
that
we
go
out,
we
send
an
officer
and
he
checks
up
and
finds
these
books
and
of
course,
if
we
get
back
to
the
average
person
remember
this,
we
have
a
problem
there.
if
we
will
look
at
the
people
who
are
most
familiar
with
the
average
person,
we
will
go
to
the
advertisers
who
spend
billions
of
dollars
a
year
in
advertising
and
their
advertising
is
designed
for
a
14-year-old
mentality
on
--
over
and
large.
so
we
must
be
careful
who
we
consider.
i
don't
consider
that
a
person
who
has
a
broad
experience
and
the
wealth
of
education
and
the
higher
intellect
that
is
represented
by
the
justice
in
this
court
are
necessarily
the
average
person.
now
the
dominant
theme
of
material,
i
don't
know
how
many
of
you
have
read
the
book
if
you
have
read
it,
i
feel
sorry
for
you
for
having
had
to
do
so.
it
is
just
a
series
of
sexual
acts
of
various
types
linked
together
with
nothing,
but
connecting
sentences
in
my
opinion.
and
does
it
apply
to
prurient
interests?
well,
again,
i
say
we're
all
aware
of
the
power
of
advertising
and
the
effective
constant
repetition
and
you
have
that
here
and
then
it
was
mentioned
that
this
had
an
important
idea
to
convey
or
probably
the
important
idea
that
it
conveyed
was
best
illustrated
from
a
quote
from
it
and
well
i
won't
read
the
quote.
but
in
the
end
--
in
this,
the
gist
of
it
is
that
this
homosexuality,
this
lesbianism
is
a
fine
thing
because
it
enables
innocent
girls
to
have
sexual
pleasures
without
the
problem
of
an
aftermath
that
might
be
result
if
they're
having
the
same
experience
with
a
man
and
therefore
it's
a
desirable
and
a
good
thing.
now
if
that
is
a
great
idea
to
put
forth
to
the
world,
i
don't
agree
and
now
in
conclusion
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
yes.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
there
is
no
question
that
it
would
have
in
my
opinion
and
the
dissenting
justice
of
the
appellate
division
of
the
superior
court
so
found.
in
fact
he
--
his
basis
of
dissent
was
that
here
the
evidence
proves
a
violation
of
the
state
law.
consequently
the
city
can't
legislate
in
this
field.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
oh
no,
we
adopt
that
--
we
--
we
have
--
we
are
--
we
are
to
test,
we
think
we
were
set
by
this
court
in
the
alberts
case.
that
is
the
test
to
--
to
that
--
the
appellate
court
applied
in
this
case
and
the
trial
judge,
frankly
i'll
say
this.
the
trial
judge
--
he
didn't
indicate
clearly
what
test
he
applied.
he
just
said
that
as
to
him
it
was
filth
and
there
were
words
to
that
effect
and
i
would
say
that
i
don't
know
just
exactly
what
standard
he
did
use.
whether
he
used
the
old
standard
or
the
new
standard,
but
i
don't
--
the
appellate
court
very
carefully
considered
the
evidence,
personally
made
their
own
findings
on
the
basis
of
reading
the
book
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
by
any
test,
it
was
obscene.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
yes
i
think
that,
that
is
the
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
i
think
that's
the
basis
of
it,
yes.
i
would
say
that
is
really
the
thing,
not
the
idea
that
it
conveys
but
the
method
by
which
it
describes
these
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
well,
let
me
say
this.
if
they
had
wanted
to
describe
--
i
mean
convey
an
idea
about
lesbianism,
they
certainly
wouldn't
have
had
to
use
the
expressions
and
phrases
that
they
have
done.
they
--
there
are
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
i
think
if
there
is
a
--
mr.
roger
arnebergh
with
--
with
suggestive
details
and
i
think
revolting
detail.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
yes.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
i
--
i
think
that
any
book,
if
the
prevailing
theme,
the
dominant
theme
of
it
is,
is
--
is
a
series
of
descriptions
in
--
in
graphic
details
of
homosexuality
and
normal
sex
relations
is
not
--
it
is
probably
obscene,
yes.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
yes
and
of
course
it
has
to
be
in
such
a
manner
that
it
does
that,
and
that's
why
i
think
the
graphicness
and
--
and
the
repetition
and
then
combined
with
the
--
with
the
suggestion
that
this
is
a
wonderful
thing
to
do,
and
you
can
get
away
with
it,
there's
no
penalty
to
pay.
there's
no
need
to
be
careful,
there's
no
need
to
worry
about
it.
innocent
girls
can
do
it
and
it's
nothing
suspicious
that
it's
so
exciting
and
no
suspicion
is
aroused
when
girls
spend
the
night
together.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
she
was
murdered
and
not
because
of
her
lesbianism.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
it
had
relationship
to
the
fact
that
she
called
a
man
to
commit
a
crime
and
then
dumped
him.
it
finally
used
that
expression.
“there
was
disregard
in
it.”
mr.
roger
arnebergh
yeah
it
was
a
question
of
him
--
jealousy
was
a
theme
of
that
and
not
the
other.
in
other
words
she
used
to
make
love
to
this
man
and
then
when
he
--
she
accomplished
her
objective
through
the
use
of
sex,
she
said,
“well
i
don't
need
you
anymore.”
that
was
all
added.
that's
just
jealousy.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
i
would
say
this
that
first
of
all,
a
book
seller
could
not
read
a
thousand
books
or
so
that
he
may
have
in
his
thought.
but
as
the
dissenting
judge
found
and
i
think
like
in
can
anything,
if
you
are
at
and
if
it
is
sustained
and
he
has
the
responsibility,
he
will
find
a
way
by
being
more
careful
of
from
whom
he
buys
and
what
he
buys.
i
have
sold
books
and
i
know
that
you
can
go
into
a
store
and
a
buyer
at
the
bookstore
doesn't
buy
a
book
without
knowing
what's
in
that
book.
now
it's
a
difficult
thing
to
prove.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
it
makes
no
difference
that's
the
point
but
i'm
just
taking
this
as
far
as
the
reasonableness
of
this
required
–
is
concerned,
who
is
better
in
a
position
to
know
than
the
man
who
is
selling
it?
mr.
roger
arnebergh
i
would
say
we
have
a
right
to
prohibit
the
sale
or
possession
of
it,
yes
and
if
we
have
the
right
to
prohibit
the
sale
we
have
the
right
to
require
the
man
who
has
it
in
his
business
to
establishing
for
the
purpose
of
sale
and
at
his
peril
not
to
--
not
to
have
seen
merit.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
yes,
in
other
words
we
have
the
same
thing
as
the
state
law
which
was
involved
in
the
albert's
case
except
that
we
do
not
make
the
personal
knowledge
of
the
--
of
the
man
commercially
dealing
it
a
necessary
element
to
prove
that
it
was
a
crime.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
arnebergh
no
we
do
not.
