justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
--
for
my
information,
tell
me
please,
is
that
liberally
is
settled,
that
the
owner
who
comes
in
and
signs
his
principals
of
bond
just
to
release
the
boat
is
not
a
party
to
that
libel
suit,
is
not
thereby
made
a
party?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
it
is
in
navigable
--
would
have
been
physical
control
of
a
tangible
thing?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
say,
“might
not
this
action.”
do
you
really
not
mean
“might
not
an
action?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
but
the
question
of
whether
this
action
was
filed
in
a
later
time
when
the
barge
has
been
removed
from
that
place.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
would
be
the
case,
i
take
it
in
every
situation
if
the
petitioner
is
right
--
well,
the
action
was
one
of
a
local
character,
an
action
in
rem,
isn't
it?
not
because
to
admiralty,
but
in
every
case
where
the
action
is
more
theory.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
was
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
would
be
probably
true
had
the
action
been
brought
to
one
personam
in
memphis,
petitioner
wouldn't
have
your
bond,
would
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
know
if
i
understand
it
and
that
bring
us,
and
we're
supposed
to
because
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
either
that
or
the
barge
thing?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
matthews,
could
you
tell
us
of
what
--
what
would
this
judgment
if
the
plaintiff
is
successful
per
se?
would
it
just
award
dollars
to
be
made
on
execution?
what
would
the
judge
--
terms
of
the
judgment
be?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
in
this
action
and
defend
like
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
talking
about
the
one
in
louisiana.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
louisiana?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
that
the
first
claim?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
decree
would
run
against
the
barge.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or,
or
or/and?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
makes
a
difference
to
my
mind
and
my
processes
of
thinking
is
to
whether
or
not
that
barge
is
going
to
be
held
in
this
decree.
