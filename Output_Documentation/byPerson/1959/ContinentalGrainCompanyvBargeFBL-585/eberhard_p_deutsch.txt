mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
very
outset,
permit
me
to
state
that
this
case
involves
no
mandates.
this
was
an
order
entered
by
the
district
court
for
the
transfer
of
an
action
and
in
the
same
order,
brought
the
case
within
the
new
interlocutory
appeals
act
so
that
the
case
came
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
appeal
and
then
here
by
certiorari.
there
is
no
mandamus
status
involved.
the
proceeding
itself
involves
an
action
in
rem
in
admiralty
instituted
on
the
southern
district
of
new
york
of
--
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
against
a
vessel
present
in
that
district.
the
cause
of
action
had
arisen
in
the
western
district
of
tennessee
where
the
libel
in
rem
could
not
have
been
brought
but
where
a
companion
action
at
law
was
pending.
the
district
court
held
that
the
convenience
of
parties
and
witnesses
in
the
interest
of
justice
required
it
to
be
transferred
to
the
western
district
of
tennessee,
rather
the
right
to
--
or
made
the
statement
that
the
question
involved
was
one
of
importance
and
of
doubtful
solution
and
an
appeal
was
accordingly
allowed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
that
court
affirmed,
holding
expressly
that
an
action
in
rem
in
admiralty
maybe
transferred
to
a
district
"to
which
the
movement
consents
to
an
unlimited
submission
of
the
cause."
it
had
been
my
intention
to
suggest
that
very
little
could
be
added
at
this
point
to
what
has
been
said
at
this
bar
in
the
two
preceding
cases
but
i
am
tempted
to
depart
from
that
original
intention
a
step
or
two
to
answer
perhaps
one
or
two
questions
which
i
think
were
not
answered
directly
at
this
bar.
in
the
first
place,
the
question
was
asked
what
would
happen,
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
the
plaintiff
had
in
his
pocket
a
letter
granting
consent
to
the
filing
of
an
action
in
a
district
in
which
it
could
not
otherwise
have
been
filed,
if
he
had
that
in
his
pocket
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
action.
now
that,
i
don't
think
that
question
was
answered
here.
i
don't
know
that
i
can
answer
it
under
the
holdings
of
the
seventh
circuit
that
would
still
not
be
a
district
in
which
the
action
could
be
filed
because
they
read
that
clause
as
stating
where
it
might
have
been
brought
in
the
absence
of
any
assent
or
waiver
from
the
defendant.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
oh
yes,
sir.
in
exact
words,
i
will
read
just
a
--
a
couple
of
lines.
we
recognize
of
course
that
venue
maybe
waived
under
proper
circumstances
but
we
do
not
think
it
can
be
waived
in
a
forum
in
which
an
action
has
not
and
could
not
have
been
properly
brought.
the
--
when
congress
provided
for
the
transfer
of
a
case
to
a
district
where
it
might
have
been
brought,
it
meant
the
district
where
plaintiff
had
a
recognized
right
to
bring
his
case
under
the
venue
act
and
that
this
right
was
unqualified
and
absolute
not
depending
upon
consent
of
the
defendant,
evidenced
by
waiver,
entry
of
appearance
or
otherwise.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
and
the
language
in
the
other
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
so,
yes
sir.
the
other
case,
the
other
seventh
circuit
case
which
is
up
here
contains
similar
language,
not
as
strong
as
that.
now,
with
reference
to
the
matter
of
josephson,
in
that
case,
judge
magruder
held
in
so
many
words
that
even
the
waiver
wasn't
necessary
once
you
got
the
defendant
and
that
as
far
as
i
can
see
with
all
due
deference
simply
just
reads
where
it
might
have
been
brought
right
out
of
the
statute
altogether
because
the
argument
which
is
made
“where
it
might
have
been
brought”
by
waiver
or
consent
isn't
even
there
anymore.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
in
in
re
josephson
and
perhaps
to
avoid
any
question,
let
me
read
two
or
three
lines
and
then
make
my
comment.
one
service
of
process
upon
all
the
defendants
has
been
effectuated
in
massachusetts,
a
transfer
order.
yes,
sir.
an
order
of
transfer
under
section
1404
(a)
sends
the
case
as
is
to
the
transferee
court
with
no
need
of
a
new
service
of
process
upon
the
defendants
after
the
case
reaches
the
court
in
mexico,
in
new
mexico.
therefore,
in
the
case
before
us,
it
was
probably
superfluous
that
the
defendants
formally
waived
any
question
of
personal
jurisdiction
over
them
in
new
mexico.
in
other
words
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
don't
think
so.
i
--
i
find
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
now,
we
--
we
both
have
to
guess
in
what
judge
magruder
meant.
i
suppose
--
but
i
understood
him
to
mean
this
venue
in
the
sense
--
and
i
don't
understand
it
either
in
that
sense,
this
venue
in
the
sense
that
the
court
would
normally
have
jurisdiction
of
this
kind
of
an
action
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
you
can
serve
in
there
or
not,
serve
them
in
your
transferor
district
then
transfer
your
case
and
pay
no
attention
to
the
phrase
“where
it
might
have
been
brought”.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no,
sir.
he
had
a
case
involving
i
think
a
derivative
action
against
some,
i
think
nine
of
his
14
defendants
could've
been
sued
in
new
mexico
and
the
other
--
i
mean
in
new
mexico,
the
other
five
could
not,
could
be
sued
only
in
massachusetts.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
the
motion
may
necessarily
import
by
implication
a
waiver.
in
our
case,
the
motion
to
transfer
says
nothing
whatever
on
the
subject,
just
a
motion
to
transfer,
period.
there
is
no
waiver,
no
express
waiver
of
any
kind
in
this
case.
now
this,
bare
in
mind,
is
an
action
in
rem
in
admiralty.
we
submit
of
course
that
affirmance
of
the
two
preceding
cases
necessarily
reverses
ours,
not
without
regardless
the
difference
in
the
type
of
proceeding
but
we
also
submit
and
that
is
the
only
further
point
to
which
i
will
address
myself
that
even
should
those
cases
be
reversed,
this
case
from
the
fifth
circuit
must
be
reversed
because
of
the
difference
in
the
nature
of
the
proceeding.
one
of
the
arguments
made
by
the
respondent
in
this
court
is
that
the
admiralty
court
has
an
inherent
power
independently
of
the
statute
and
under
rule
44
of
the
admiralty
rules
of
this
court
to
effect
such
a
transfer.
we
submit
that
no
such
power
exist
certainly
in
contravention
of
the
specific
provisions
of
the
statute
dealing
with
“any
civil
action
which
it
has
been
held
and
which
clearly
includes
admiralty
causes.”
a
proceeding
in
rem
maybe
instituted
only
in
the
district
in
which
the
race
can
be
found.
we
do
submit
that
that
approaches
a
jurisdictional
--
if
it
does
not
enter
the
field
of
a
jurisdictional
requirement
as
opposed
to
one
of
venue.
it
is
a
proceeding
in
rem
as
such
only
within
the
district
in
which
the
race
may
lie.
in
admiralty,
such
a
proceeding
maybe
brought
against
the
vessel
even
though
no
personal
action
would
lie
against
the
owner
of
the
vessel,
as
for
instance,
in
cases
of
non-contract
salvage,
in
compulsory
pilot
cases,
in
cases
of
bareboat
charters
modernly,
in
cases
in
which
a
vessel
has
been
transferred
and
the
lien
follows
the
vessel
against
the
vessel
but
not
against
the
new
owner.
in
such
a
proceeding,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
not
personal
over
the
claimant.
he
is
merely
a
sort
of
ancillary
party.
he's
not
actually
a
party
to
the
litigation,
no
personal
judgment
can
be
rendered
against
him.
he
merely
comes
in
and
claims
his
vessel
if
he
files
a
bond.
that
bond
stands
in
place
of
the
vessel
but
no
personal
action
maybe
rendered
against
the
claimant
except
of
course
under
the
bond
if
he
gives
one
and
signs
it.
the
claimant
under
vessel
therefore,
we
submit
only
this,
may
not
move
under
section
1404
(a)
to
transfer
because
his
motion
in
a
sense
is
not
--
could
not
even
constitute
a
waiver
in
behalf
of
the
vessel.
he
is
not
a
party
to
the
litigation
and
he
cannot
constitute
the
district
to
which
a
removal
is
sought
one
in
which
the
action
might
have
been
brought
because
that
applies
only
to
one
in
which
the
race
is
to
be
found.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
he
is
not
thereby
made
a
party.
his
only
liability
then
is
on
the
bond
but
not
in
the
original
proceeding
which
continues
against
the
vessel
or
the
bond
in
rem.
he
is
not
an
actual
party.
now,
it's
a
tremendously
interesting
question
and
perhaps
i
should
go
into
it
a
little
bit.
there,
the
case
is
unusual.
two
cases
of
this
court
upheld,
one
involving
a
fire
statute
which
limits
the
liability
of
the
owner
in
case
of
fire
on
a
vessel
under
certain
circumstances.
a
contention
was
made,
the
vessel
does
not
have
that
immunity
which
is
granted
by
statute
to
the
owner
of
the
vessel
and
this
court
has
held
that
doesn't
make
sense.
the
vessel
does
have
the
same
immunity
as
the
owner.
the
same
thing
applies
to
the
limitation
of
liability
which
is
a
sort
of
bankruptcy
statute
under
which
the
owner
of
a
vessel
may
limit
his
liability
to
the
value
of
the
vessel
after
the
accident.
in
those
cases,
he
files
his
petition
for
limitation.
he
puts
up
a
bond
for
that
value
and
the
vessel
is
released
and
he
then
repairs
the
vessel
and
an
action
was
brought
against
the
vessel
as
repaired
stating
the
limitation
does
not
apply
to
the
vessel,
only
to
the
owner
and
this
court
said
that
is
talking
in
riddles
and
doesn't
make
sense.
in
the
third
case,
boyd
i
think,
and
it
is
another
case
in
this
court
and
that
did
not
involve
admiralty
but
it
involved
an
action
in
rem,
boyd
versus
the
united
states.
that
was
a
forfeiture
condemnation
proceeding
in
rem
against
merchandise.
the
united
states
on
seizing
that
property
sought
to
require
the
owner
of
the
property
to
bring
his
books
and
records
in
the
court
from
which
they
would
get
certain
information.
he
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
government
said,
“well,
this
is
not
an
action
against
you,
it's
an
action
in
rem.”
and
they
held
that
nevertheless,
he
was
entitled
to
that
defense
and
that
would
be
carrying
the
doctrine
too
far.
now,
those
are
the
three
cases
in
this
court
that
tie
in,
let
us
say,
the
owner
with
the
race
in
such
an
action.
but
it
--
there
isn't
any
question
that
the
action
in
rem
is
different
from
an
action
in
personam
despite
the
fact
that
such
distinctions
or
analogies
as
the
case
maybe
have
been
made.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
true.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
of
course,
what
this
court
says
is
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
is
(inaudible)
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
right.
i
concur.
now,
i
might
--
such
one
little
further
point.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
surely.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
at
--
well,
now
that
also
is
not
an
absolute.
the
rule
of
this
court,
the
admiralty
rule
does
say
the
action
is
to
be
brought
in
the
district
which
the
race
is
to
be
found.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no
question
at
all,
and
this
rule
makes
that
statement.
but
--
and
you
--
i
suppose
we
must
recognize
practice,
in
universal
practice,
an
accepted
custom
even
in
matters
of
jurisdiction
i
suppose.
but
these
actions
are
brought
with
the
statement
the
vessel
is
now
or
will
be
during
the
pendency
of
this
action
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
that
is
the
usual
allegation
and
that
is
accepted.
there
are
decisions.
first,
that
the
vessel
need
not
be
seized,
that
the
bond
maybe
filed
and
take
the
place
of
the
vessel
and
perfect
the
jurisdiction
court
even
if
there's
no
actual
seizure.
and
there
are
two
or
three
district
court
cases
in
which
it
is
stated
that
the
vessel
need
not
even
be
in
the
district,
if
the
bond
is
filed,
it
becomes
in
effect
the
race.
there
is
no
appellate
decision
to
that
effect.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
don't
think
there's
any
--
well,
i
would
say
by
consent
of
both
parties.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
thought
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
right.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
right.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
none
whatever
and
that
is
very
frequently
the
case.
now,
take
the
case
--
all
this
is
--
this
is
partly
been
discussed
before
here.
but
in
this
connection,
becomes
more
interesting
perhaps,
the
internatio-rotterdam
case
that
has
been
mentioned
at
this
bar.
now,
that
was
a
suit
in
rem
filed
in
new
york
with
the
usual
statement
that
i
made
is
now
or
will
be
during
the
pendency
of
this
action,
et
cetera.
the
vessel
didn't
show
up
in
new
york
but
she
showed
up
as
i
recall
it
in
philadelphia.
the
libelant
then
went
to
the
judge
in
new
york
and
said,
“please,
i
move
to
transfer
this
case
to
philadelphia
where
the
vessel
actually
is.”
and
that
is
a
jurisdiction
in
which
the
action
might
have
been
brought.
now,
the
vessel
is
there,
perhaps
might
have
been
brought
before
on
the
assumption
that
she
would
come
there.
the
question
was
raised
but
the
judge
doesn't
have
the
power
to
sign
the
order
of
transfer
since
he
never
got
jurisdiction,
the
case
goes
the
vessel
and
never
in
new
york
in
the
first
place.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no
bond
was
filed
in
new
york
but
the
judge
did
affect
the
transfer
and
the
transfer
was
upheld
and
that
was
the
status
of
the
case
as
far
as
it
involves
the
situation.
in
other
words,
there
are
cases
of
this
sort
which
have
arisen,
and
that
is
of
course
why
it's
so
important
for
this
court
to
consider
this
whole
issue
as
it
arises
in
these
three
cases.
and
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
we
are
guilty
of
that
in
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
more
places
than
new
york
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
for
ratio,
i
may
say
it
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
and
that
is
universal.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that
is
universal
practice
for
parties
to
get
together
and
arrange
for
a
convenient
jurisdiction
by
the
filing
of
bond,
right
or
wrong
that's
done.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
and
of
course,
the
new
orleans
is
the
great
part
of
the
world.
[laughter]
why
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
asked
some
questions
about
legislative
history
and
i
would
like
to
touch
on
those
for
about
two
moments.
it
--
it
was
mentioned
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
why
but
the
most
significant
factor
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
1404
(a)
is
a
reviser's
note
which
says
this
is
based
on
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens.
this
court
has
held
that
that
is
too
narrow,
that
the
discretion
may
be
broadened
over
what
it
was
on
the
--
maybe
broadened
under
this
statute
over
what
it
was
before
as
to
what
constitutes
convenience
of
parties
and
witnesses
in
the
interest
of
justice.
i
might
mention
perhaps
as
related
to
the
question
of
legislative
history,
the
following
subsection
of
that
statute
1404
(b).
it
throws
some
light
on
the
meaning
to
me
of
1404
(a).
in
the
first
place,
it
states
that
the
district
court
may
transfer
an
action
in
its
discretion.
now
that
is
without
any
question
of
interest
of
justice,
convenience
of
parties
and
so
on
from
one
division
to
another
division
within
the
same
district
and
then
it
goes
on
and
has
this
rather
interesting
sentence.
“transfer
of
proceedings
in
rem
brought
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
maybe
transferred
under
this
section
without
the
consent
of
the
united
states
where
all
other
parties
request
transfer.
now,
it
--
it
doesn't
necessarily
clarify
the
preceding
section
but
it
does
throw
some
light
on
it.
in
other
words,
if
the
united
states
is
a
party
to
a
proceeding
in
rem,
you
may
transfer
from
one
division
to
another
without
the
consent
of
the
united
states.
we
submit
that
you
cannot
transfer
at
least
without
the
consent
of
all
parties
in
rem
from
one
district
to
another.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
on
motion
of
either
party,
or
i
suppose
ex
proprio
motu.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
of
course,
the
united
states
could
be
a
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
a
plaintiff.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
but
it
could
not
be
--
then
of
course
(voice
overlap)
the
situation
would
not
apply
because
it
says
without
its
concern.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
none
whatever,
sir.
but
we
submit
that
the
--
the
action
cannot
be
transferred
over
the
protest,
let
us
say,
of
the
vessel
to
another
district
in
which
the
vessel
could
not
have
been
found.
that
is
a
question
of
jurisdiction
rather
than
a
venue
in
the
in
the
personam
actions
which
have
been
discussed
to
you.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
just
a
--
a
few
more
words.
may
it
please
the
court.
whether
a
question
--
with
regard
to
the
question
as
to
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
and
the
fact
that
it
is
not
in
personam
so
far
as
it's
postured
before
this
court
is
concerned.
i
direct
your
attention
to
pages
16
and
17
of
the
transcript,
so
that
we
will
understand
this
so-called
letter
of
undertaking.
it
--
it
is
simply
a
substitute
for
a
so-called
stipulation
which
an
admiralty
is
a
name
for
a
shorty
bond.
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
you
will
see
it
is
the
intent
of
this
undertaking
that
the
rights
of
the
libel
and
then
claimant
respondent
in
this
proceeding
shall
be
in
full,
purposes
shall
be
taken
to
be
precisely
the
same
as
they
would
have
been
had
the
vessel
in
fact
been
taken
into
custody
by
the
marshall
under
said
in
rem
process
and
released
for
the
filing
of
claim
and
release
bond.
we,
as
claimant
reserving
in
behalf
of
the
vessel
all
other
objections
and
defenses
otherwise
available,
except
those
which
might
be
predicated
upon
the
fact
that
the
vessel
was
not
actually
seen.
in
other
words,
the
cases
in
rem
proceeding,
its
character
has
not
been
changed
by
the
giving
of
this
letter
of
undertaking
which
says,
“we'll
pay
any
judgment
you
get
against
the
barge.”
and
the
judgment
or
decree
in
admiralty
is
for
dollars
against
the
vessel
requires
her
condemnation
and
sale
to
satisfy
the
judgment
and
that
condemnation
and
sale
of
course
does
not
take
place
if
someone
comes
in
and
voluntarily
pays
the
amount
due
which
is
the
normal
course
especially
when
bonds
are
posted.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
think
you
--
i
think
you
can
put
the
statement
that
way
but
it
is
only
the
in
rem
part
of
the
proceeding
which
has
come
here
as
judge
brown
said.
that
was
the
only
question
decided
below
with
regard
to
this
phase
of
the
case.
it's
all
one
proceeding.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
it's
all
one,
yes.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
you
can't
very
well
split
it
and
say
we
have
two
actions
and
we'll
transfer
the
in
personam
and
keep
the
in
rem
so
that
as
a
matter
of
course,
it
--
you
couldn't
transfer
the
in
personam
without
the
in
rem
because
its
just
one
--
one
libel.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
oh,
no,
they
are
all
in
one
proceeding
which
is
the
normal
practice.
the
cases
have
so
held
that
it
is
permissible
to
do
it.
but
they
are
--
you
could
file
a
libel
in
personam
in
one
district
and
the
libel
in
rem
in
another
and
the
two
cases
would
go
on
neither
subject
to
dismissal.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
of
course,
that's
a
very
difficult
question.
i
suppose
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
certainly
all
of
us,
and
there's
never
--
we've
never
really
raised
the
--
that
question.
i
have
assumed
that
the
in
rem
action
takes
the
precedence
because
it
is
the
one
that
could
not
be
moved
to
one
side.
it
must
remain
where
it
was
brought.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
there
isn't
the
slightest
question
that
if
this
were
an
in
personam
action
alone,
there
was
a
second
available
forum.
there
isn't
any
question
about
that.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
new
orleans,
sir.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
don't
think
you
can
split
the
action
that's
two
parts.
no,
sir.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
as
you
would
--
but
we
didn't
have
them
here.
we
haven't.
we
--
they
are
not
separate
here.
they
are
all
one.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
said
that
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that,
that
would
be
the
result
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
correct
--
i
think
the
in
rem
action
has
its
situs
and
must
remain
there
and
that
brings
up,
mr.
justice
whittaker's
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
surely.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
there's
no
question
about
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no
question
about
that.
it
is
our
position
that
this
action
may
not
be
transferred
onto
that
stat
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes,
sir.
but
i
--
i
don't
think
the
rules
are
different
in
admiralty
case,
sua
sponte,
you
have
to,
an
admiralty
case
in
rem.
i
had
--
in
this
case
to
be
joined
in
a
single
action
with
a
one
in
personam,
but
setting
that
aside
for
a
moment,
the
1404
(a)
as
it
relates
to
admiralty
actions
in
personam
in
my
humble
opinion
be
treated
just
like
any
other
civil
action.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
it's
a
point
i
was
just
coming
to,
mr.
justice
whittaker
as
to
battle
a
local
action.
in
my
humble
opinion,
1404
(a)
can
have
no
effect
whatever
on
a
local
action.
you
can't
bring
an
action
to
foreclose
land
anywhere
except
where
the
land
is.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
right.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
right.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that
is
correct
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
now,
in
this
case,
you
have
a
race
which
is
movable.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
and
you
can
bring
the
action
wherever
that
race
happens
to
be
at
the
time.
in
the
land,
it
can
only
happen
to
be
in
one
place,
but
the
principle
is
the
same
in
my
opinion.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
right.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
right.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
don't
think
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
we
must,
yes.
i
think
that
is
correct,
the
latter
statement,
yes.
now,
very
briefly,
if
i
may
be
allowed
a
couple
of
moments
more.
this
question
about
an
in
rem
action
and
it's
applying
only
in
compulsory
pilotage
cases
and
so
on,
it's
a
very
real
thing.
a
solvent
owner
is
liable
in
an
in
rem
action
only
insofar
as
the
value
of
that
vessel
is
concerned
and
no
more
and
that
is
very
important
matter.
in
a
salvage
case
for
instance,
the
owner
isn't
liable
at
all
unless
he
has
made
an
agreement.
the
vessel
alone
is
liable.
he
may
defend
and
try
to
get
the
salvage
reduced
if
he
has
that
much
of
an
interest.
in
the
case
of
the
bareboat
charter,
when
the
vessel
is
in
collision,
the
owner
is
never
liable.
he
said
no
part
in
the
land
and
so
on.
there
are
a
number
of
such
cases.
it
isn't
just
one
thing.
finally,
with
regard
to
a
question
which
was
asked
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
harlan
that
occurred
to
me
about
judge
learned
hand
having
expressed
himself
on
this
subject,
the
case
is
foster-milburn
v.
knight
in
181
f.2d,
he
did
express
himself
as
saying
that
the
role
that
there
can
--
that
there
must
be
two
forums
applies
under
1404
(a).
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
he
has
quoted
it
from
justice
jackson's
opinion.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
don't
think
it
is
but
in
the
torres
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
in
the
torres
case
which
is
cited
--
the
anthony
versus
kaufman
case,
judge
frank
does
say
that.
the
torres
case
however,
talks
of
the
vessel
having
been
available
in
the
transferee
district
as
well.
and
then
judge
medina
goes
on
and
says,
“anyway,
they've
waived
it
here.”
now,
to
that
extent,
it
is
a
doctrine.
thank
you.
