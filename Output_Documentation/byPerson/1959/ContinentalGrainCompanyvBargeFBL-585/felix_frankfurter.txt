purely,
when
they
tried
--
they
tried
1404
and
as
i
understood
the
respondents
here,
tried
1404
to
the
statutory
--
statutory
venue
provisions
standing
by
themselves.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
actually
didn't
have
that
case
before
leaving,
mr.
deutsch?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
those
--
all
the
three
cases
involved
general
considerations
of
the
policy
which
were
rendered
applicable
not
because
there
was
an
identification
between
the
owner
and
the
vessel
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
because
the
policy
also
apply
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
respectable
documents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
bond
is
deemed
to
be
in
place
of
--
the
bond
is
--
is
identified
with
the
vessel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
fulfilling
the
function
of
what
seizure
of
the
vessel
it
dealt
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
deutsch,
am
i
wrong
that
--
is
my
recollection
treacherous,
new
york
is
often
arrayed
between
practice
of
filing
a
bond,
knowing
that
the
suit
will
be
brought
although
the
vessel
is
physically
never
seen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
indeed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
my
knowledge
is
limited
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
local
area.
justice
felix
frankfurter
surely,
i
think
been
done
out
of
time.
and
my
--
i'm
out
of
--
mind
in
new
york
which
has
a
little
admiralty
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
clear
indication
and
i'd
overlooked
the
--
that
--
that
the
transfer
maybe
made
by
the
--
on
the
motion
of
the
plaintiff,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
plainly,
that
is
--
plainly,
that
allows
the
plaintiff
to
move,
doesn't
it?
what
you've
just
read,
mr.
deutsch.
if
the
united
states
is
a
party,
then
the
united
states
maybe
a
party
under
the
vessels
act
by
a
plaintiff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
party
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
the
united
states
could
be
a
plaintiff,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
way
around,
shows
that
the
--
otherwise
have
no
function
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
wouldn't
--
mr.
matthews,
without
--
without
commenting
on
the
validity
of
your
argument
of
the
--
of
the
conclusion,
but
the
argument
doesn't
emasculate
the
statute.
it
merely
says
that
with
reference
to
admiralty,
in
rem
proceedings,
you're
restricted
to
where
the
vessel
is
at
the
time
that
the
--
monition
is
--
is
without
or
whatever
the
he
technical
phrase
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
that
is
an
in
rem
case,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
and
that's
the
implication
of
your
argument
is,
it
might
have
been
--
if
that
resulted
in
admiralty,
we've
got
to
reexamine
as
to
what
might
have
been
needed?
