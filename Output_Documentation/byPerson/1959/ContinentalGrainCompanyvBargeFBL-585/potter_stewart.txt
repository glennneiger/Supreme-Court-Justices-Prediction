justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
quite
under
--
i
didn't'
quite
understand
what
you
said,
judge
magruder
said
in
in
re
josephson.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
he
could've
meant,
to
me,
that
the
very
making
of
the
motion
by
the
defendants
constituted
a
waiver.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
leave
that,
i
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
what
you're
telling
us.
take
the
case
of
a
--
of
a
vessel
plying
mississippi
river,
the
ohio,
mississippi
river
system
up
and
down.
it's
part
of
the
new
orleans.
now
that
vessel
owes
--
that
the
nature
of
things
likely
to
be
in
a
different
federal
judicial
district
everyday
isn't
like
--
and
as
the
--
does
the
question
of
where
a
suit
maybe
brought
in
rem
depend
exclusively
on
--
where
the
vessel
happens
to
be
at
--
at
a
moment
in
time?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
--
therefore,
sort
of
conferring
jurisdiction
by
consent
of
the
defendants,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
both
parties.
justice
potter
stewart
but
until
or
unless
the
vessel
itself
were
actually
subjected,
there
would
be
no
requirement
on
the
defendant
to
file
a
bond.
justice
potter
stewart
no
bond
was
filed
in
new
york?
justice
potter
stewart
take
--
take
an
action
involving
a
land.
to
acquire
title
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
land
doesn't
move
around.
justice
potter
stewart
i
did
--
i
didn't
quite
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
go
ahead.
justice
potter
stewart
what
you're
telling
us
is,
as
i
understand
it
then,
that
while
there
is
an
ancient
history
which
seemed
to
give
personifications
of
the
vessels
that
an
actual
present
practice
does
amounts
to
no
more
and
no
less
than
getting
jurisdiction
by
attachment
of
personal
property
in
ordinary
--
ordinary
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
why
couldn't
this
action
have
simply
been
brought
in
memphis
in
personam?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
it
wasn't
signed
so
i'm
thinking
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
it
could
be
argued
that
the
substitution
of
a
bond
or
of
an
undertaking
such
as
is
in
this
case
converts
an
in
rem
action
to
an
in
personam
action?
justice
potter
stewart
beyond
that,
you
think
it's
just
a
matter
of
labels?
justice
potter
stewart
falling
out
of
libel
instead
of
a
complaint
or
some
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
because
only
one
district
court
has
jurisdiction
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
over
the
subject
matter.
justice
potter
stewart
quite
a
part
from
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
venue
or
jurist
--
or
a
personam.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
question
put
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
is
confided
in
rem.
