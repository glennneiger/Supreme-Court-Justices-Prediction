mr.
george
b.
matthews
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
fundamental
purpose
of
this
appeal
is
to
determine
and
to
effectuate
in
some
manner
the
purpose
of
the
transfer
statute
whether
it'd
be
in
a
patent
case,
a
diversity
case
or
an
admiralty
case.
now,
certainly,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
not
questionable.
it
was,
i'm
sure,
to
save
time
and
expense
and
to
promote
the
efficient
administration
of
our
judicial
system.
how
to
achieve
this
purpose
is
obviously
questionable
in
view
of
these
appeals.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
question
of
ambiguity
of
the
transfer
statute.
it
has
been
suggested
in
the
paramount-rodney
case
and
i
think
clearly
implied
in
the
karachi
case
that
mr.
deutsch
just
mentioned
in
the
fourth
circuit
that
the
word
“brought”
means
simply
filed
in
a
court
that
has
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
nothing
more.
that
is
that
you
need
not
be
able
to
maintain
the
action.
thus,
in
the
karachi
case,
a
suit
was
filed
in
new
york
for
the
obvious
purpose
of
interrupting
the
one
year
limitation
under
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
the
allegation
account
that
mr.
deutsch
mentioned
was
made
that
the
vessel
would
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
the
vessel
in
fact
never
was
on
learning
that
you
would
call
at
baltimore,
the
motion
to
transfer
was
made.
judge
parker
in
the
course
of
his
opinion
pointed
out
first
that
the
filing
of
the
suit
in
new
york
interrupted
proscription.
that
is,
the
court
had
come
--
the
court
was
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
and
therefore,
the
filing
of
the
suit
even
without
(inaudible)
of
process
within
the
year
was
sufficient
to
interrupt
proscription.
he
further
said
that
clearly,
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
and
therefore
powered
to
any
--
any
necessary
orders
to
maintain
the
litigation.
this
must
--
this
evidence
is,
one,
interpretation
of
the
word
“brought”
in
the
statute.
other
cases
including
judge
whittaker's
opinion
in
the
general
electric
case,
apparently
take
the
position
that
the
word
“brought”
means
filed
at
a
time
when
the
court
has
power
to
issue
process
and
in
other
words,
power
to
achieve
or
file
adjudication
of
the
case.
so
there,
we
have
two
clearly
divergent
ideas.
secondly,
we
have
the
time
problem
which
has
been
mentioned
here
before
and
to
further
confound
that
time
problem
or
i
think
everyone
agrees
that
the
words
“might
have
been
brought”
not
everyone
certainly,
but
mr.
king
was
the
last
one
that
suggested
it,
refer
to
some
time
in
the
past.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
accident
happened
in
memphis,
tennessee
while
our
barge
is
being
loaded
by
the
--
with
the
petitioner's
grain,
the
barge
sank
in
memphis.
the
grain
was
removed
by
sailboats,
the
barge
was
raised
and
she
remained
in
memphis.
according
to
the
record,
for
a
week
or
more
after
the
sinking,
now,
might
not
this
action
have
been
brought
in
memphis
and
i
do
not
intend
to
make
a
play
on
words.
but
the
barge
was
there,
subject
to
the
process
of
the
memphis
court
at
a
time
prior
to
the
filing
of
this
case.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
no
sir,
i
mean
an
action
by
the
cargo
owner.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
yes.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
exactly
and
that
--
that
is
what
poses
the
problem
in
any
admiralty
case,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
if
our
opponents
are
right,
this
statute
is
emasculated,
because
there
is
only
one
jurisdiction.
and
if
they
are
right,
you
can
never
transfer.
that
can't
be
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
your
honors
have
recognized
in
connection
with
limitation
--
mr.
george
b.
matthews
sir?
mr.
george
b.
matthews
oh
very
well,
mr.
justice
black.
the
contention
is
made
here
that
in
an
in
rem
proceeding
in
admiralty,
the
only
just
--
possible
jurisdiction
is
that
in
which
the
vessel
is
at
the
time
the
suit
is
filed.
in
other
words,
there
is
never
any
other
form.
now,
if
the
further
contention
that
you
have
to
have
on
alternate
forum
or
a
transferee
forum
at
the
time
the
--
the
instant
action
is
filed,
that
can't
be
because
the
vessel
can't
be
in
two
places
at
one
time.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
--
i've
limited
--
i
meant
to
limit
the
emasculation
to
an
admiralty
in
a
match
--
mr.
george
b.
matthews
correct.
and
insofar
as
that
action
is
concerned,
you
could
never
have
a
transfer
under
our
opponent's
theory.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
correct,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
i'm
--
i'm
not
clear
as
to
the
use
of
the
words
“local
character”,
in
rem,
yes.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
yes,
sir.
that
would
be
the
case.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
well,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
that's
correct
and
this
court
has
held
i
think
that
if
--
i
think
was
the
case
in
this
court
that
a
dismissal
of
an
action
involving
land
in,
say,
west
virginia
brought
in
ohio
on
the
court's
own
motion
was
from,
even
though
the
defendant
raise
no
objection.
that
was
--
mr.
george
b.
matthews
ellen
--
excuse
me.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
ellenwood
versus
marietta
chair
company,
158
u.s.
105.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
the
point?
mr.
george
b.
matthews
i
was
simply
agreeing
with
judge
--
mr.
justice
stewart
that
this
court
has
held
that
the
dismissal
of
an
action
involving
west
virginia
land
brought
in
ohio
by
an
ohio
judge
on
his
own
motion
was
the
problem.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
without
any
suggestion
of
dismissal
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
now,
i
--
your
honors
have
recognized
the
need
for
a
transfer
for
convenience
in
admiralty
cases
and
particularly
in
limitation
of
liability
proceedings.
for
example,
rule
54
provides
that
in
the
--
that's
the
venue
rule,
provides
that
a
limitation
proceeding
maybe
transferred
to
any
district,
not
one
word
could
have
been
brought
but
to
any
district
for
convenience
of
the
parties,
not
for
convenience
of
the
witnesses,
not
in
the
interest
of
justice
but
only
for
convenience
of
the
parties.
now,
admiralty
rule
54,
may
it
please
the
court,
provides
that
in
all
suits
in
admiralty,
in
all
cases
not
provided
for
by
these
rules
by
statute,
the
district
court,
to
regulate
their
practice
in
such
a
manner
as
they
deem
most
expedient
for
the
due
administration
of
justice.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
not
only
is
this
motion
in
the
instant
case
or
rather
this
transfer
in
the
instant
case
justified
under
the
transfer
statute
of
the
judicial
code,
but
it
is
also
justified
under
admiralty
rule
44
adopted
by
this
court.
that
rule
as
well
as
the
others
were
adopted
pursuant
to
an
act
of
1842
empowering
the
court
to
adopt
rules
to
--
to
adopt
rules
regulating
the
practice
and
--
in
equity
and
admiralty
matters
before
the
circuit
courts
and
the
district
courts.
a
very
interesting
case
came
up
under
that
act
and
the
rules
adopted
by
the
court
and
that
was
the
steamer,
st.
lawrence.
the
court
had
adopted
a
rule,
number
12,
which
authorize
in
rem
process
against
a
vessel,
although
the
--
the
admiralty
law
gave
no
maritime
lien
provided
that
the
homeport
of
the
vessel
or
rather
state
law
of
the
homeport
gave
a
lien
for
repairs
performed
in
the
homeport.
the
admiralty
rule
then
being
that
there
was
no
maritime
lien
for
repairs
and
supplies
performed
as
given
in
the
homeport.
the
court
held
that
that
rule
was
valid,
that
it
was
not
an
extension
of
jurisdiction
although
it
did
authorize
an
in
rem
process
and
of
seizure
where
non-existed
under
the
maritime
law,
but
that
it
was
merely
a
rule
regulating
practice
before
the
court.
now,
certainly,
a
transfer
of
this
action
is
nothing
more
than
a
regulation
of
the
practice
or
administration
of
the
district
courts.
the
--
if
--
if
again
our
opponents
are
correct
and
there
can
never
be
a
transfer
in
an
in
rem
action
in
admiralty,
the
--
and
certainly,
those
cases
must
arise
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
witnesses
in
the
interest
of
justice
would
be
served,
the
only
way
to
achieve
it
then
would
be
pursuant
--
excuse
me
--
to
rule
44.
and
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
a
problem.
now,
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
personification
of
a
vessel,
i
have
rather
a
number
of
cases
as
i'm
sure
that
people
have
and
i
am
frankly
confessed
that
i'm
somewhat
misdefined.
they
say
that
a
--
on
offending
vessel
is
a
juridical
person
entitled
to
be
proceeded
against
in
rem.
but
what
happens
where
the
owner
is
not
in
(inaudible)
the
vessel
doesn't
defend
the
litigation.
the
vessel
doesn't
pay
and
again
in
the
case
of
(inaudible)
the
vessel
doesn't
pay
the
decree.
the
vessel
doesn't
post
a
bond
and
certainly,
the
claimant
of
any
vessel
is
a
very
much
interested
party
to
any
litigation.
he
does
not
simply
come
in
and
say,
“i
claim
the
vessel
and
i
put
up
a
bond
and
i
will
await
your
decree.”
he
comes
in
and
files
a
claim
as
we
did
here
saying
that
he
claims
the
said
barge's
owner
and
prays
to
be
permitted
to
defend.
that
is
the
claimant's
interest.
he
is
the
owner
of
the
vessel.
he
has
a
proprietary
interest
in
it
and
as
this
court
said
in
the
boyd
case
mentioned
by
mr.
deutsch,
the
vessel
doesn't
pay
the
claimant,
the
owner
does.
now,
another
interesting
case
along
those
lines
is
the
decision
of
judge
learned
hand
in
burns
brothers
transportation
company
versus
the
central
railroad
of
new
jersey
which
will
indicate
the
fact
that
at
least
in
the
second
circuit,
the
personification
theory
has
gotten
somewhat
out
of
vote.
in
that
case,
burns
brothers
sued
for
barge
damage
caused
by
a
collision
with
a
car
float
belonging
to
the
central
railroad
of
new
jersey.
the
car
float,
when
it
had
gone
adrift
was
in
the
possession
of
the
--
or
long
island
railroad.
the
suits
were
filed
in
personam
only.
the
time
of
trial,
the
central
was
in
reorganization
and
the
trial
of
course
did
not
proceed
against
that
road.
a
decree
of
sole
fault
was
entered
against
the
long
island.
when
they
went
around
to
collect
a
decree,
the
long
island
was
in
reorganization.
the
libelant
then
had
the
idea
that
he
would
file
an
in
rem
suit
against
the
car
float
which
he
did.
now,
what
i
say
to
this
court
now
was
dicta,
for
a
reason
i
will
mention
but
judge
learned
hand
there
held
that
the
pry
in
personam
decrees
were
bars
to
the
--
in
present
in
rem
action.
and
he
said,
“disputes
arise
between
human
beings
not
inanimate
things
and
would
be
absurd
to
give
the
beaten
party
another
chance
because
on
second
trial,
he
appears
as
a
claimant
to
a
vessel
that
is
and
can
be
nothing
but
the
measure
of
his
stake
in
the
controversy.”
he
then
went
on
however
to
permit
the
suit
because
at
the
time
the
first
action
was
filed,
seizure,
in
rem
seizure
of
the
car
float
was
prohibited
pursuant
to
an
order
in
the
reorganization
proceedings.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
not
only
jurisdiction,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
security
which
i
think
is
the
main
purpose.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
the
--
certainly,
jurisdiction
but
why
in
this
case
where
the
acting
--
new
orleans
action
was
filed
not
only
in
personam
which
was
not
mentioned
in
the
opening
argument
but
in
rem.
no
security
was
needed.
nothing
was
needed
to
enforce
jurisdiction,
federal
was
in
new
orleans,
federal
have
an
alternative
forum,
a
transferee
in
--
forum
in
memphis.
so
certainly,
have
the
in
rem
feature
not
been
joined,
there
would
be
no
question
about
the
possibility
of
transfer
in
this
action
to
--
mr.
george
b.
matthews
i
know
of
no
reason
why
it
couldn't.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
federal
is
amenable
to
process
in
memphis,
at
the
--
for
a
week
after
the
casualty,
the
barge
was
amenable
to
process
in
memphis.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
mr.
justice
whittaker,
they
do
not
have
a
bond
now.
all
they
have
is
a
letter
of
undertaking
signed
by
federal
alone
and
not
federal's
underwriters
saying,
“we
will
do
what
we
would
have
to
do
anyhow.”
that
is,
pay
the
decree
if
you
get
one.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
the
letter
of
undertaking,
there
are
two
types
generally.
there
is
an
owner's
letter
and
an
underwriter's
letter.
the
underwriter's
letter
is
in
terms
identical
to
a
release
bond
except
no
premium
is
charged,
that's
the
only
difference
i
know
of.
an
owner's
letter,
simply
says,
“in
consideration
of
your
not
seizing
my
barge
and
not
requiring
a
release
bond,
i
agree
to
pay
any
judgment
you
got
against
me
or
the
barge.”
but
that
is
nothing
more
than
an
obligation
that
i
would
have
in
the
event
of
a
decree.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
just
--
no,
because
the
giving
of
the
letter
releases
the
lien
i
think,
because
the
letter
provided
that
the
rights
of
the
parties
would
be
the
same
as
if
a
release
bond
had
been
given
and
there
is
no
question
that
if
a
release
bond
was
given,
the
lien
would
be
released.
so
i
think
a
fair
construction
of
the
letter,
and
i'm
sure
concurred
in
by
our
opponents
is
that
the
giving
of
the
letter
release
the
lien
and
the
barge
was
free
from
--
thereon.
thank
you.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
may
it
please
the
court.
with
reference
to
a
question
which
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
regarding
the
consent
waiver
in
this
case,
there
is
no
consent
in
so
many
words,
however,
we
submit
that
whereas
in
this
case
following
the
falling
of
the
libel
not
only
was
a
personal
appearance
entered,
but
a
claim
was
filed
for
the
vessel
and
the
letter
of
undertaking
was
given
that
the
motion
is
tantamount
to
a
consent
since
it
will
carry
with
it
the
appearances.
secondly,
i
might
further
mention
that
in
the
general
electric
case
decided
by
mr.
justice
whittaker,
he
remarked
that
in
his
opinion,
there
was
little
question
with
that,
a
motion
constituted
a
waiver
of
venue
--
a
motion
to
transfer
constitute
a
consent
to
transfer
our
waiver.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
could
be
argued.
however,
i
don't
know
what
the
difference
is
or
maybe
it's
a
distinction
without
a
difference
except
in
one
case
that
occurs
to
me.
for
example,
in
the
public
vessels
act,
there
is
no
provision
for
in
rem
seizure
of
public
vessels.
however,
a
libelant
may
elect
to
proceed
according
to
principles
in
rem.
as
i
say,
what
that
amounts
to
with
one
exception,
frankly,
i
don't
know.
the
exception
being
the
case
of
compulsory
pilotage
where
the
courts
upheld
that
an
owner
is
not
liable
in
personam
for
the
negligence
of
a
state
required
or
compulsory
pilotage
but
that
a
vessel
is.
now,
that
is
the
only
distinction
that
occurs
to
me
between
an
in
rem
and
an
in
personam
action
or
liability,
if
you
want.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
correct.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
beyond
the
point
of
jurisdiction
and
security
and
except
for
the
compulsory
pilotage
case,
yes.
now,
in
this
court
--
mr.
george
b.
matthews
sir?
mr.
george
b.
matthews
unless
there
is
an
expressed
statute
such
as
in
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea,
there
is
no
limitation,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
there's
a
doctrine
of
laches.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
no,
sir.
there
are
--
mr.
george
b.
matthews
i
--
i'm
--
i
don't
envision
a
case
at
the
moment.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
i
--
i
don't
quite
see
it.
i
know
of
no
case.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
the
judgment
would
be
against
federal
barge
lines
certainly
in
the
in
personam
action
and
--
mr.
george
b.
matthews
the
in
personam
--
there
are
two
actions
here,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
there
are
two
actions,
two
--
mr.
george
b.
matthews
two
--
there
are
two
actions.
yes,
sir.
one
action
but
two,
not
a
cross
proceeding.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
no,
sir.
there
is
an
in
personam
action
against
federal
barge
lines
seeking
a
recovery
against
that
individual
respondent.
joined
to
that
is
a
proceeding,
it's
all
one
proceeding
actually.
i'm
maybe
using
words
loosely.
but,
as
part
of
that
action,
there
is
a
prayer
for
a
recovery
in
rem
against
the
barge
fbl-585.
those
two
recoveries
sought
are
part
of
one
action,
so
that
if
there
is
a
finding
of
fault
on
the
respondent's
part
and/or
on
the
part
of
the
barge,
there
would
be
a
decree
in
favor
of
continental
and
against
federal
on
account
of
the
--
or
rather
in
response
to
the
in
personam
prayer.
there
would
also
be
a
decree
against
the
barge
and
her
stipulators
or
her
surety
if
you
want
in
response
to
the
in
rem
part
of
the
action.
however,
since
the
lien
on
the
barge
would
have
been
discharged
by
the
giving
of
the
bond,
the
decree
would
be
satisfied
by
the
barge's
stipulators
or
surety.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
or
her
stipulators,
yes.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
or.
i'd
--
i
don't
--
i
--
i
would
--
i
don't
know
that
there'll
be
any
great
difference,
i
would
assume.
in
any
event,
it
would
be
satisfied
by
the
stipulators.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
i'll
say
this
to
you.
it's
somewhat
inconsistent
to
me.
that
is
the
way
decrees
are
drawn,
but
that
to
my
mind,
conflicts
with
the
jurisprudence
which
is
certainly
are
well
established
that
the
giving
of
a
bond
releases
any
lien
for
account
of
which
the
bond
is
given.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
i
think
that's
a
loose
phrasing
of
his
because
--
mr.
george
b.
matthews
sir?
mr.
george
b.
matthews
look,
the
court
will
note
the
statement
in
--
in
our
question
presented
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
we
post
it
as
follows,
whether
a
district
court
may
on
motion
of
the
respondent
transfer
an
admiralty
suit
brought
--
brought
both
in
personam
and
in
rem
--
mr.
george
b.
matthews
--
to
another
district
wherein
the
in
personam
respondent
was
suable
from
--
but
from
which
the
risk
had
been
removed
prior
to
the
falling
of
--
of
the
libel.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
no,
sir,
with
the
respondent.
i'm
reading
from
the
question
--
we
contraverted
there,
the
petitioner's
question
presented
is
the
brown
pretty
far
on
page
2.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
the
--
the
--
yes,
sir,
as
well
as
the
lower
court's
per
curiam.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
how
do
you
mean,
sir?
mr.
george
b.
matthews
yes.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
you
mean
that
there
was
--
that
there
were
two
--
mr.
george
b.
matthews
oh,
yes.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
one
further
the
point
i
like
to
mention
which
i
think
is
quite
important
and
that
is
that
in
this
case,
we
are
not
confounded
with
any
statutory
venue
requirements.
there
are
none
here.
venue
in
an
in
personam
action
is
wherever
the
respondent
can
be
caught
to
--
so
to
put
it,
or
whether
wherever
his
property
can
be
attached
by
a
writ
of
foreign
attachment.
that
maybe
in
anyone
of
a
number
of
places,
for
instance,
a
new
york
respondent
may
have
property
in
louisiana
which
we
could
seized,
perform
the
basis
of
--
of
personal
jurisdiction
at
least
to
the
extent
of
property.
venue
in
an
in
personam
action
is
basically
where
the
vessel
is
or
where
the
owner
or
claimant
should
it
be
a
charge
we
will
agree
to
appear
for
the
vessel.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
yes,
sir,
i
think
it
is.
and
that's
one
difference
between
this
case
and
the
two
preceding
cases,
one
basic
difference
i
think.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
the
in
personam
respondent,
mr.
justice
black,
was
suable
in
memphis
so
that
had
the
in
rem
action
not
be
enjoined
to
the
in
personam
action.
there
would
be
--
we
would
not
be
here
today
because
there
would
be
an
ultimate
forum
under
any
theory
of
this
statute.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
because
it
maintained
an
office
there.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
and
the
in
rem
--
mr.
george
b.
matthews
if
that
be
--
if
that
would
be
the
correct
theory.
mr.
george
b.
matthews
correct.
thank
you,
your
honors.
