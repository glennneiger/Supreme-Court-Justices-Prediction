mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
your
honors,
you've
just
enjoyed
a
--
an
extraordinarily
fair
statement
of
the
facts
in
the
record
from
mr.
schober
as
to
the
basic
facts
in
his
presentation,
i
have
no
quarrel.some
of
the
inferences
that
he
draws
principally
in
his
briefs
more
or
so
than
here
on
the
argument
this
afternoon,
i
do
quarrel.
what
i'd
like
to
do
was
confine
my
argument
just
to
the
facts
in
the
case.
i
believe
from
the
comments
that
were
made
from
the
bench,
some
of
the
points
that
were
covered
in
the
respondent's
brief
as
to
the
length
of
the
questioning
as
to
a
murder
investigation,
as
already
been
observed
by
the
court,
through
the
petitioner
was
with
the
police
at
the
third
precinct
in
williston
park
from
1:15
in
the
afternoon
until
3
a.m.
the
following
morning
when
he
was
moved
to
police
headquarters,
but
it
was
not
until
sometime
between
4
or
5
o'clock
when
there
was
positive
identification
of
the
body
of
sunday
graham
that
the
police
were
conducting
a
murder
investigation.
up
to
that
time,
detective
rouffet
had
been
carrying
on
this
all
by
himself
if
there
were
--
if
there
was
any
overzealousness
by
the
police,
it
was
rouffet
who,
starting
the
night
before,
gave
up
his
sleep,
searching
around
hempstead,
looking
for
this
little
girl
to
reunite
her
with
her
family,
and
he
was
the
one
almost
unaided
that
questioned
the
petitioner.
and
it
was
very
intimate
questioning
up
until
the
time
of
the
discovery
of
the
body.
now,
during
the
argument
and
in
the
briefs
for
the
petitioner,
mr.
schober
points
out
that
from
hempstead
where
the
child
was
found
--
was
supposed
to
come
home
from
school,
the
petitioner
was
leaving.
the
police
came,
took
him
from
hempstead
to
east
williston
and
in
the
petitioner's
brief
they
say,
the
reason
is
not
explained
in
the
record.
quite
simply,
the
precinct
which
has
geographical
jurisdiction
over
the
village
of
hempstead
is
physically
located
in
east
williston.
why
the
police
brought
this
petitioner
to
east
williston,
was
because
they
had
--
that
was
the
only
facility
available
for
conducting
this
local
investigation
into
a
missing
child.
the
petitioner
also
complains
that
the
record
fail
to
explain
why
at
3
a.m.
in
the
depth
of
the
night,
he
was
moved
to
police
headquarters.
there
is
no
explanation
on
the
record
other
than
the
chief
of
detectives
had
his
base
of
operations
in
headquarters
and
didn't
go
out
to
all
the
28
police
departments
and
8
precincts
of
the
county
police.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
there
are
28
separate
police
departments
in
the
county,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
well,
some
of
the
departments
are
quite
small.
they
are
nothing
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
--
more
than
uniform
patrol
groups
but
some
of
the
departments
like
the
county
police
have
seven
or
eight
precincts
maybe
150
or
200
men
in
each
precinct.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
a
functional
division
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
--
and
with
independent
authority.
even
the
questioning
that
started
with
respect
to
the
murder
investigation,
there
was
no
questioning
until
stock
came
back
from
dinner,
even
that
questioning
with
respect
to
the
murder
investigation.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
about
9
o'clock,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
the
testimony
of
rouffet
is
not
too
clear.
he
says
that
he
did
not
question
the
petitioner
while
stock
was
at
dinner.
simply,
the
record
shows,
stock
was
from
the
homicide
bureau,
rouffet
was
a
precinct
detective
who
was
not
immediately
concerned
with
investigations
of
homicides.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
inspect
--
the
record
is
silent
as
to
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
--
whether
inspector
--
when
inspector
pribell
finished
these
test.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
dr.
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
by
8
o'clock
they
had
taken
the
samples
but
then
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
that
is
right,
your
honor.
now,
i
don't
honestly
know
when
those
tests
were
--
the
results
of
those
tests
were
known
to
the
police.
they
were
all
run
out
by
inspector
pribell
and
i
would
imagine
that
at
the
minimum,
it
took
several
hours
for
him
to
make
the
necessary
laboratory
analysis
but
then
he
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
all
were
negative,
your
honor.
the
fingernail
scrapings,
all
10
fingers
were
negative
for
blood,
the
seminal
stain
was
absolutely
negative
and
the
test
conducted
as
for
the
underclothing
showed
that
inspector
pribell
could
not
identify
it
in
the
laboratory
as
being
blood
or
--
or
human
blood
or
even
what
type
of
human
blood
it
was.
that
was
the
testimony
on
the
trial.
in
that
connection,
pribell
also
testified
that
the
purpose
of
these
tests
and
these
were
not
unique.
there
were
equally
designed
to
exonerate
as
well
as
to
inculpate
the
petitioner,
even
the
questioning
of
this
petitioner
as
a
suspect
in
a
murder
investigation
wasn't
continued,
once
it
had
started
at
9
o'clock.
we
have
the
interruptions
when
he
conversed
privately
and
apparently
from
the
testimony
in
the
record,
none
of
the
detectives
overheard
what
was
the
private
conversation
between
the
petitioner
and
his
former
wife,
his
paramour
until
four
days
previously,
mrs.
graham,
neither
did
they
overhear
the
private
conversation
between
the
petitioner
and
mrs.
graham's
brother.
now,
these
conversations
varied
from
about
15
to
30
minuets
in
length.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
well,
i
would
say
the
questioning
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
--
in
a
murder
investigation.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
the
record
--
the
testimony
of
both
detectives
stock
the
homicide
squad
and
inspector
pribell
show
that
once
the
body
was
located,
they
proceeded
to
the
scene
of
the
crime.
now,
the
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief
says,
for
example,
that
blood
was
seen
under
the
body
at
4
o'clock.
in
police
procedure,
the
body
wasn't
touched
until
the
squad
from
headquarters
and
the
laboratory
technicians
arrived
at
the
scene.
the
record
doesn't
show
when
that
took
place,
but
it
was
sometime
after
pribell
or
stock
arrived
at
the
scene.
the
local
police
--
there
is
no
testimony
that
a
local
police
moved
the
body.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
and
they
were
--
the
body
was
discovered
by
a
railroad
worker
around
4
o'clock.
there
was
no
identification
until
positive
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
it
was
until
sometime
after
5
apparently,
that
stock
and
pribell
arrived
at
the
scene.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
yes.
i
don't
know
but
just
when
that
took
place.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
yes.
there
were,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
well,
there,
again,
the
record
isn't
clear
as
to
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
you
can't
tell
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
no,
there
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
yes.
it's
possible
to
work
out
a
timetable
for
much
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
--
but
not
for
all.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
i
believe
--
i
was
talking
about
the
interruptions
or
the
lapses
in
the
questioning
of
the
petitioner
as
a
suspect
in
a
murder.
after
they
arrived
at
police
headquarters
and
chief
panell
had
sent
out
the
sandwiches
and
coffee
for
everybody,
he
questioned
the
petitioner
for
approximately
an
hour,
following
that
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
that
must
--
sometime
between
3:30
and
4:30
apparently
was
the
questioning
conducted
by
the
chief
of
detectives.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
yes
they
did,
your
honor.
this
is
3:30
and
4:30
a.m.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
a.m.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
at
mineola.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
before
the
questioning
commence
by
the
assistant
district
attorney,
it
was
a
further
period
during
which
the
petitioner
wasn't
questioned
at
all,
following
the
questioning
by
chief
panell.
what
we
have
here
basically
is
the
question
before
the
court.
why
did
he
confess
at
all?
he
was
a
--
i
understood
that
he
was
a
high
school
graduate,
the
way
i
read
the
record.
he
was
a
high
school
graduate,
a
man
with
admittedly
superior
mental
prowess,
a
man
moreover
with
considerable
experience
with
the
police.
in
1947,
when
he
was
arrested
for
that
rape
at
a
night
point,
he
resisted
all
efforts
to
confess,
took
the
stand
in
1947
and
swore
innocence.
he
was
a
man
who
had
spent
10
years
at
(inaudible),
one
of
the
best
postgraduate
legal
institutions
we
have
today.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
yet
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
and
in
several
fields,
your
honor.
at
any
rate,
he
didn't
--
the
feeling
of
the
respondents,
it
wasn't
the
suction
process
of
interrogation
as
the
petition
would
have
us
understand
on
this
brief
that
was
responsible
for
it.
when
he
was
told
by
assistant
district
attorney
that
blood
had
been
found
--
that
sunday
graham's
blood
was
found
on
his
underclothing,
that
was
the
point
at
which
he
knew
that
the
jig
was
up.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
this,
of
course,
is
not
again,
not
explained
in
the
record.
all
i
can
--
is
--
it
was
an
assumption
of
the
assistant
district
attorney.
it
was
probably
a
misunderstanding
of
the
information
that
had
been
communicated
to
him
by
the
police
during
that
conference
just
before
he
started
a
talk
or
have
a
dialogue
with
phillips.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
the
blood
apparently,
visual
inspection,
showed
what
appeared
to
be
bloodstains.
the
assistant
d.a.
and
all
of
the
police
assumed
it
was
sunday
graham's
blood.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
the
chief
of
detectives,
the
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
--
the
assistant
district
attorneys
are
invited
on
occasion
to
participate
in
the
questioning
but
only
after
the
police
have
run
out
and
exhausted
their
own
resources.
in
practice,
these
q
&
a's
are
taken
in
the
event
that
there
is
an
indictment
might
be
return
to
ascertain
whether
or
not,
there
is
some
proof
of
lying
by
a
defendant
who
makes
in
a
main
and
exculpatory
statement.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
sometime
earlier
that
evening
prior
to
11
p.m.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
yes.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
the
record
is
silent
as
to
when
the
district
attorney's
office
was
first
notified.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
i
said
sometime
prior
to
11
o'clock,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
just
when
it
was
and
the
record
does
not
mention.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
well,
as
i
say,
your
honor,
visual
inspection
by
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
--
the
police
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
--
had
shown
what
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
--
appeared
to
be
bloodstains.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
that
is
true.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
that
is
true.
that's
the
only
thing
that
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
--
could
be
wrong.
now,
i
want
to
go
one
step
further
on
this.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
laboratory
examination
was
never
able
to
established
one
way
or
the
other
whether
or
not
this
was
sunday's
blood
--
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
--
but
apparently
from
its
effect
on
the
petitioner,
he
know
whose
blood
it
was.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
yes.
in
this
sense,
your
honor,
in
arguing
at
the
close
of
the
people's
case,
the
attorney
--
the
trial
counsel,
the
attorney
who
led
for
the
defense,
argued
most
vehemently
that
this
confession
should
be
excluded
and
that
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed
because
of
this
misrepresentation.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
none
whatever,
your
honor,
none
whatever.
well,
returning
to
the
principle
question
which
is,
why
did
he
confess?
up
to
this
point,
and
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
this
question
and
answer
statement
that
was
taken
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
was
not
interrupted
for
any
reason.
it
was
not
a
situation
where
he
continued
its
exculpatory
statement,
then
there
was
an
interruption,
the
assistant
d.a.
left
the
room,
a
half
hour
or
an
hour
passed
and
then
when
he
came
back,
he
was
agreed
to
already
to
confess.
the
early
--
but
this
was
one
statement.
the
early
part
of
this
statement
is
remarkable.
phillips
in
addition
of
being
intelligent
is
an
extremely
articulate
individual
with
a
mask
of
almost
total
recall
of
specific
detail.
this
part
of
his
question
and
answer
statement
that
he
was
--
gave
to
the
assistant
district
attorney
was
almost
exactly
the
same
as
he
had
given
earlier
before
the
discovery
of
the
body
to
detective
rouffet
and
that
he
gave
license
numbers,
names
of
people
he
met,
detailers
involved,
itinerary
had
taken
the
day
of
the
crime,
so
as
to
place
himself
far
away
from
the
location
of
the
school
or
the
corner
near
the
school
were
sunday
had
been
picked
up.
incidentally,
the
description
that
was
furnished
by
sunday's
classmate
could
have
fit
anyone
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
negro
men
in
the
village
of
hempstead
to
say
nothing
of
the
rest
to
the
county
of
nassau.
but
here
was
this
statement
going
along
until
the
moment
when
he
is
confronted
by
the
one
thing
that
he
couldn't
lie
away
from.
up
to
that,
the
statement
was
a
tissue
of
lies.
there
was
--
this
was
the
one
thing
that
when
he
was
confronted
with
it,
he
realized
that
he
could
not
lie
away
from.
at
that
point,
here
is
a
man
--
we
have
this
word
in
the
suggestion,
of
course,
in
the
briefs
now
that
he
was
beaten
and
kicked
around.
here
was
the
man
who
--
when
he
is
confronted
by
that,
calls
the
--
asked
the
assistant
district
attorney
call
in
those
police
officers.
why?
the
point,
the
matters,
“he
kicked
me,
he
beat
me,”
no,
to
shake
hands
with
them.
in
their
reply
brief
--
in
the
reply
brief,
the
petitioner
says,
"well,
these
put
up
evidence
on
number
of
things,”
the
shaking
of
the
hands,
evidence
that
he
was
finally
so
overcome,
so
overborne
that
it
was
significant
of
the
fact
that
he
was
giving
in
capitulating.
we
can
assume
all
kinds
of
things
as
to
why
he
shook
hands
with
these
officers.
he
might
have
been
congratulating
among
their
appointments
or
promotions,
that
was
beside
the
point.
if
this
was
the
man
who
on
cross-examine
--
while
being
pressed
on
cross-examination
and
tried
to
wiggle
out
of
the
assistant
d.a.'s
questions
as
to
why
his
testimony
deferred
from
the
answers
he
gave
in
his
question
and
answer
statement
that
he
was
beaten,
would
he
shake
hands
with
him?
we
say
it's
inconceivable.
further,
the
record
shows
that
the
police
exceeded
to
his
request
to
call
in
a
priest.
he
was
catholic.
the
little
girl
and
her
mother
--
the
entire
family
was
catholic.
he
was
--
the
police
called
in
a
priest
right
away.
they
brought
in
manita
graham
and
curtis
maddox
again.
they
arraign
them
at
the
very
first
opportunity
at
10
a.m.
following
the
arraignment,
phillips
voluntarily
agreed
with
them
to
go
out
and
visit
the
scenes
of
the
crime.
now,
is
this
--
is
this
conceivable
that
a
man
who
claims
for
the
first
time
on
his
trial
that
he
was
beaten?
after
arraignment
before
a
judge
would
thereafter
voluntarily,
drive
around
the
county
with
the
police?
is
it
conceivable
that
if
a
police
had
beaten
him
or
had
laid
a
finger
on
him,
they
would
have
brought
in
his
former
wife,
a
priest
or
arraignment
before
a
court
where
he
could
make
prompt
complaint?
no
complaint
was
made.
there
was
no
complaint
made
when
he
was
placed
in
a
detention
cell.
in
fact,
there
was
no
issue
raised
at
the
trial.

not
until
after
the
indictment
had
been
returned.
the
practice
in
new
york
is
to
assign
counsel
after
indictment
and
not
before.
the
preliminary
arraignment
before
the
magistrate
is
merely
to
advise
him
of
all
his
rights
under
the
statute
to
fix
bail
if
it's
a
case
where
a
bail
maybe
fixed
and
to
conduct
an
examination
if
requested
by
the
defendant.
new
york
practice
is
in
all
arrest
prior
to
indictment.
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
an
examination,
confrontation
of
the
witnesses
and
they
must
take
the
stand
and
spell
out
by
their
testimony
and
they
are
subject
to
cross-examination
whether
or
not
basis
exist
for
holding
him
for
the
action
of
the
grand
jury,
and
that
basis
is
there
must
be
proof
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
unless
be
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
defendant
under
arrest
has
committed
it
and
unless
the
people
produced
that
proof
within
48
hours
and
no
adjournment
is
permitted
under
new
york
practice
unless
that
proof
is
produced
within
48
hours,
the
court
must
order
the
release
of
the
defendant.

in

cases,

are

immediately
upon
the

mr.

everything,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
in
fact,
on
cross-examination
of
this
court
reporter
who
has
been
a
court
reporter
for
over
50
years,
this
was
a
fact
--
question
that
was
asked
by
the
petitioner's
trial
counsel.
that
was
the
whole
break
in
the
trial.
up
to
that
point,
the
petitioner's
trial
counsel
had
been
making
statements
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
planned
to
bring
out
36
witnesses
to
prove
that
he
had
been
assaulted,
largely
police
witnesses,
we
have
to
assume.
however,
when
he
asked
the
court
stenographer,
the
court
reporter,
whether
or
not
these
transcripts
had
everything
that
was
said
and
whether
or
not
it
was
a
fact
that
phillips
--
that
the
report
and
the
assistant
district
attorney
did
not
come
in
to
phillips
presence
until
after
he'd
agreed
to
confess,
upon
receiving
a
negative
answer
from
the
court
reporter,
the
whole
thrust
of
the
offense
changed
from
that
point
forward
in
the
trial.
there
was
not
another
word
read
as
to
any
violence
because
examination
of
the
transcript
shows
that
the
assistant
district
attorney
talked
with
the
petitioner
for
almost
an
hour
before
he
broke
out
and
confessed
and
the
testimony
of
the
court
reporter,
in
fact
the
testimony
of
phillips
himself
is
that
that
transcript
omitted
nothing,
everything
was
put
into
that
transcript
by
this
court
reporter.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
i.
heneghan
that
is
right.
