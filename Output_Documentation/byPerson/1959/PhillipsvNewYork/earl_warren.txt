and

--
what
was

particular
time?
chief

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
what
time
was
that
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
are
not
--
they
knew
nothing
of
the
body
at
that
time.
chief

chief

yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heneghan,
there
are
some
question
raised
as
to
the
fairness
of
the
district
attorney
in
saying
that
they
found
sunday's
blood
on
his
under
--
underclothing,
was
there
--
is
there
any
doubt
as
to
whether
the
district
attorney
at
that
time
knew
that
--
that
blood
was
found
on
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
so
if
there
--
so
if
there
was
any
--
any
misrepresentation
on
his
part,
it
went
no
further
than
to
--
to
make
the
assumption
that
what
the
police
had
told
him
was
bloodstains
on
--
on
the
underclothing
of
the
defendant
was
sunday's
blood.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
that's
the
only
thing
that
could
be
wrong
with
it.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heneghan,
may
i
ask?
is
the
entire
conversation
between
the
district
attorney
and
the
petitioner
in
the
record
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
all
in
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
almost
an
hour,
his
statement
was
exculpatory
and
--
and
then
it
changed
when
the
district
attorney
mentioned
the
blood?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
--
