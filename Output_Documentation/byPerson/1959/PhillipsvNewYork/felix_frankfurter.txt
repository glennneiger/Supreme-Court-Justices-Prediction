justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
you
were
speaking
of
the
time
when
it
wasn't
known
that
violence
had
been
committed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
to
what
--
what
--
in
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
police
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
police
officer
at
that
time
was
trying
to
find
out
where
this
missing
girl.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
exculpation
by
him
was
not
exculpation
of
any
charge
or
innuendo
of
a
charge
of
murder,
was
it,
as
to
whether
he
had
any
knowledge
of
the
girl?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
question
even
by
implication,
your
submission
that
--
that
--
to
tell
if
the
circumstances
should
be
considered.
i
merely
wanted
to
be
sure
that
you
agreed
that
up
to
4
o'clock
what
the
police
did
was
the
conventional
inquiry
into
the
facts
of
a
complaint
that
had
been
made
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
should
cutting
off
at
4
--
up
to
4
o'clock,
is
there
anything
that
you
complained
of
up
to
that
time?
i'm
not
suggesting
you're
not
entitled
then
to
look
at
the
whole
sequence
of
the
events
but
up
to
the
--
up
to
what
to
--
up
to
--
what
to
--
what
took
place
up
to
4
o'clock?
judge
by
itself
in
isolation
for
the
moment,
is
there
anything
that
you
complaint
of?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
i
meant
by
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
if
--
if
the
girl
had
turned
off
or
if
such
a
complaint
is
made
to
the
appropriate
police,
i
suppose,
it's
necessary
to
make
an
inquiry
to
--
into
the
--
into
a
missing
girl,
and
up
to
that
time,
they
did
what
--
i
--
i
take
it,
police
are
entitled
and
indeed
under
duty,
bound
to
make.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
4
o'clock
to
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
does
the
evidence,
the
undisputed
evidence
up
to
the
number
of
people
or
the
relayed
in
which
this
question
was
taken
place,
what
is
your
view
of
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
they
in
there
collectively
or
individually
in
succession?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
--
wasn't
the
captain
(inaudible)
who
phillips
knew?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
did
introduce
himself,
didn't
he,
to
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
prior
to
the
captain,
didn't
the
captain
stay
in
there
only
for
a
little
time
within
--
isn't
that
the
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
captain
(inaudible)
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
nothing
to
address
you
but
these
things
are
--
one
has
to
go
to
creep
along.
when
you
say
group
investigation,
the
evidence
is
not
very
clear
whether
three
or
four
or
five
or
two
or
one
or
in
there
any
defined
length
of
time,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
call
a
marathon
what
we've
called
in
conations
as
no
relay
of
--
of
officers
infringing
on,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
has
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
has
to
read
and
draw
his
inference
from
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
told
us
previously
that
he
could
have
his
own
--
his
own
doctor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
examinations
were
negative,
weren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
--
if
they
offered
him
that
his
own
physician
or
any
physician
or
a
friend
physician
could
make
these
tests
that
would
indicate
the
limit
of
how
far
they
were
intending
to
go,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
into
that,
may
i
ask
this,
this
conversation
between
phillips
and
mrs.
graham,
what
significance
do
you
attach
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
--
you
just
said
a
minute
ago
that
he
was
asked
whether
he
wants
to
see
her.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
say
he's
subject
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
reading
it,
it
seems
to
me
quite
--
i
--
i
thought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
one
makes
of
it
because
in
view
of
the
relationship
of
the
parties,
namely,
graham
and
phillips,
and
the
--
the
non-production
of
evidence
or
justice
douglas
had
just
entered
what
was
discovered
up
to
that
time
was
objectively
neutral
or
negative.
i
don't
know
what
significance
one
can
attach
to
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
--
if
one
would
--
i
would
draw
one
inference,
if
he
had
been
forced
on
him
an
irate,
anguish,
frustrate
mother
of
a
violated
child
is
one
thing
but
you
asked
if
he
wants
to
see
mrs.
graham
that
no
suggestion
of
any
--
that
his
consent
was
to
his
on
that
respond,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
say
so
far
as
one
can
tell
it,
it
--
i
don't
know
what
inference
to
draw
from
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
at
that
time,
it
wasn't
known
that
there
was
this
threat.
this
threat
came
out
on
the
trial
later
and
as
i
understand
it,
you
--
no
credence
should
be
attached
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
relevant
if
they
had
forced
mrs.
graham
on.
but
the
question
i'm
putting
to
you
is
all
we
have
from
the
record
is
that
he
was
asked
to
draw
(inaudible)
as
voluntarily
and
as
--
as
could
make
--
should
be
because
i'm
asking
you
a
question
and
he
suggest,
"i'd
like
to
see
it."
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
i
have
no
other
knowledge
than
what
i
really
record.
therefore,
i'm
asking
you
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this?
did
anything
come
out
at
the
trial,
be
it
on
the
record
of
court
as
to
what
took
place
in
the
talks
between
phillips
and
mrs.
graham
in
later
mr.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
schober,
may
i
ask
you,
if
you
would
be
good
enough
to
summarize
what
you
conceive
to
be
whereas
the
evidence
in
the
procession
of
the
police,
up
to
that
hour
pointing
to
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
deny
it
but
i
just
like
to
know
who
gave
that
information.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
--
did
she
--
did
he
testified
that
she
told
them
on
the
afternoon
of
the
13th
that
--
that
phillips
had
made
such
a
threat?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
see
her,
he
saw
the
mother
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
saw
the
mother
of
the
child.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
all
that
we
know
that
he
had.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
there
is
no
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
intimation
that
she
then
thought
that
he
was
the
murderer,
is
there,
that
the
mother
saw
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
any
indication.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
known
--
was
that
known
up
to
--
at
--
at
midnight
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
the
--
the
results
were
negative
not
only
as
to
the
bloodstains
under
the
--
at
this
person
but
also
the
bloodstain
that
they
found
on
a
--
on
an
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
a
--
but
there
was
a
bloodstain
but
no
identification
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
to
the
extent
that
it
was
human
blood.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
they
said
explicitly
that
"we
found
blood
on
one
of
your
garment,
that
is
identifiable,
coming
from
the
body
of
this
said
girl‚Äù?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
should
--
that
comes
at
a
little
--
if
you're
going
to
read
from
the
examinations
by
the
district
attorney,
that's
a
little
later,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
as
to
the
negative
finding
of
--
of
the
washing,
that
is
rather
significant
in
view
of
what
they
knew
the
fact
that
they
had
found
that
the
child
had
been
violated,
isn't
that
right?
the
--
they
did
--
they
had
made
that
findings
by
that
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
really
negative
in
that
sense.
they
found
no
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
test
disclosed
nothing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
spoke
of
only
one
prior
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
two?
wasn't
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
wasn't
there
an
earlier
instance
or
is
that
just
brought
out,
an
earlier
of
he
filing
a
charge
or
in
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
are
two
separate
instances
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
--
of
general
sex
offenses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
had
ambition
even
to
go
to
college.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
part.
he
said
in
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
brought
out
on
his
direct
examination,
i
gather
lengthy,
in
which
then
a
claim
was
made
on
direct
that
he
was
touched
by
anybody?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
--
was
the
jury
told
that
they
would
be
put
back
before
it
is
approved?(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
physical
violence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
are
not
always
vindicated.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
bound
to
say
that
the
summing
up
by
counsel
for
the
defendant
could
hardly
be
more
effective
considering
what
he
has
to
deal
with
on
the
record,
at
least
that's
where
it
struck
one
reader
anyhow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
made
a
comment
a
minute
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
thought
made
it
appropriate
for
me
to
make
a
counter
comment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
awfully
easy
to
look
back
and
see
how
someone
else
would
have
tried
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
police
--
28
police
department?
what
is
the
police
department
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i
know.
what
is
the
police
--
police
station?
what
is
the
police
department
in
that
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
department
a
functional
division
of
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
about
10
o'clock?
when
was
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
9
o'clock.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
--
the
--
when
--
through
the
inference
that
they
were
rather
waiting
for
the
return
from
these
tests,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
it
was
--
i
thought
(inaudible)
what
is
his
name?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
he
testified
that
by
8
o'clock,
they
had
it,
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
have
to
have
these
arguments
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
heneghan,
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
the
murder
investigation
didn't
begin
or
until
about
9
o'clock,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
questioning,
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
begin
until
9,
the
fact
that
there
was
murder
to
be
investigated
was
clear
at
5.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
do
you
account
for
the
hours
between
5
or
9?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
body
was
found
about
at
5
o'clock,
petitioner
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
it
wasn't
--
but
it
wasn't
until
5
that
the
police
got
to
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
--
then
they
took
the
body,
an
investigation
--
an
autopsy
was
made
of
the
body,
wasn't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
there
were
also
various
samples
of
necessary
evidence
to
make
test
of
the
child's
body
or
what
had
taken
place
there,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
suppose
that
accounts
to
intervening
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
say
that
probably
account,
one
can't
tell.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
isn't
a
timetable
in
the
record,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
there
is
an
--
a
timetable
to
be
worked
out
to
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
approximately.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
particular
field
of
law
only.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
justification
for
saying
that
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
does
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
heneghan,
how
does,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
the
procedure
in
--
in
your
county?
who
--
who
--
how
does
the
district
attorney
get
into
such
a
murder
investigation,
does
the
chief
of
police
determines
when
the
time
has
come?
justice
felix
frankfurter
chief
of
detectives.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
when
this
--
during
his
office
was
alerted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
when
the
court
stenographer
was
told
to
hold
himself
to
readiness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
--
was
the
district
attorney
give
an
order
to
stand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
thought.
i
think
you
just
said
around
11
o'clock.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
point
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
suggestion
that
the
trial
that
--
that
phillips
was
overreached
by
this
statement
and
was
it
claimed
that
the
trial
of
this
statement
was
conscious
false
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
in
--
in
--
on
the
witness
stand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
it
--
was
the
--
the
claim
made
through
question
and
answer
before
the
jury,
that
the
defendant
has
been
overreached
by
--
by
a
consciously
false
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
were
--
when
were
the
two
counsels
who
defended
him
at
the
trial
appointed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
counsel
therefore
--
the
indictment
is
filed,
the
counsel
appointed
in
a
capital
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
case.
this
kind
of
case.
justice

was
that
true
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
average
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
exhibit
28,
isn't
it?
exhibit
28
is
the
one
that
gives
you
the

the
answer
