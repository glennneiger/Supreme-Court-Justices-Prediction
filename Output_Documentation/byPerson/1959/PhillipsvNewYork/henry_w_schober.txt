mr.
henry
w.
schober
if
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
here
on
certiorari
issued
by
this
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york.
to
review
a
judgment
of
affirmance
entered
by
that
court,
affirming
a
judgment
of
conviction
entered
in
the
county
court
of
nassau
county
for
the
state
of
new
york
convicting
the
defendant
of
the
felony
murder
of
one
sunday
graham.
the
question
that
we
raised
and
upon
which
we
are
here
is
whether
a
confession
obtained
from
the
petitioner
was
secured
in
violation
of
due
process
as
accorded
to
him
and
guaranteed
to
him
under
those
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
considering
and
approaching
that
question,
we
feel
that
we
should
bring
before
this
court
those
factual
circumstances
which
are
conceded
by
the
respondent
to
have
existed
with
regard
to
the
development
of
the
investigation
and
ultimate
securing
of
the
confession
and
which
are
undisputed
in
the
record.
in
approaching
this
problem
and
giving
some
of
the
background
of
the
crime
itself
and
of
the
investigation
that
was
conducted,
may
i
call
attention
first
to
the
fact
that
the
respondent
phillips,
a
male
negro
of
the
--
of
the
age
of
approximately
42
years
have
had
prior
conflicts
with
the
law.
he
had
been
convicted
on
a
prior
occasion
in
this
very
country,
the
country
of
nassau
of
the
crime
of
attempted
rape
by
violence.
he
was
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
that
crime
and
having
been
released
on
parole,
he
was
later
again
apprehended,
charged
with
a
violation
of
his
parole
for
the
commission
of
a
sexual
offense
upon
a
young
white
girl.
and
upon
the
charge
for
violation
of
parole
in
that
instance,
he
was
recommitted
for
a
period
of
time.
the
petitioner
phillips
had
sometime
prior
to
the
commission
of
the
crime
charged
here
been
married
to
one
manita
graham
(ph).
they
had
been
divorced
but
they
had
continued
an
illicit
relationship
between
them
subsequent
to
time
of
their
divorce.
mrs.
graham
had
adopted
sunday
graham
who
was
approximately
eight
years
of
age
upon
the
time
--
about
the
time
of
her
unfortunate
demise.
now,
on
may
12,
1958,
sunday
graham
was
last
seen
leaving
the
school
which
she
was
attending.
she
was
dressed
in
a
school
uniform
and
was
seen
by
one
of
her
playmates
to
enter
an
automobile
driven
by
a
male
negro,
a
car
of
a
type
kind
that
was
owned
by
phillips
and
driven
by
one
who
is
dressed
in
clothing
such
as
that
which
had
been
possessed
by
phillips
at
that
time.
once
she
did
not
--
when
sunday
did
not
return
to
her
home,
mrs.
graham,
at
about
5:30
in
the
evening
of
that
day,
made
report
to
the
police.
and
she
gave
them
the
information
concerning
a
prior
marriage
to
the
petitioner
and
stated
also
to
the
police
that
petitioner
had
followed
her
within
a
short
period
of
time
prior
to
the
disappearance
of
sunday
and
had
expressed
certain
threats
to
it.
but
mrs.
graham
had
asked
phillips
to
get
out
of
her
life,
and
he
stated
to
her
in
return
that
if
he
did
get
out
of
her
life,
he
would
not
get
out
alone
and
that
she
would
be
sorry.
about
10:15
on
the
evening
of
the
day
of
sunday's
disappearance,
the
local
police
precinct
in
the
village
of
hempstead,
nassau
county
communicated
with
the
precinct
of
the
country
police
that
had
jurisdiction
over
that
location.
and
at
about
10:20
on
that
evening,
the
country
police
officers
were
given
a
description
of
a
missing
girl,
the
location
of
the
school
at
which
she
had
been
attending
and
the
other
information
such
as
i
have
just
mentioned
to
this
court.
the
following
morning,
the
country
police
spoke
to
the
classmate
of
sunday
who
had
seen
her
entering
the
automobile.
they
obtained
the
information
from
that
classmate,
kathy
mullen
(ph)
concerning
the
place
at
which
the
automobile
was
seen,
the
person
driving
and
the
fact
that
sunday
attended.
at
11
a.m.
because
of
the
information
that
had
been
obtained
by
the
police
concerning
phillips'
background
in
relationship
with
mrs.
graham
and
sunday,
visited
phillips'
home
in
hempstead,
searched
his
rooms
and
took
clothes
from
him
that
he
had
been
wearing
and
that
were
in
his
apartment
and
also
had
him
identified
through
them
the
automobile
which
he
owned.
they
questioned
him
concerning
sunday
graham
and
his
--
and
her
disappearance
and
then
requested
that
he
accompany
them,
the
police,
to
their
local
police
precinct
some
distance
away
and
beyond
the
place
where
police
headquarters
of
the
county
are
located.
they
arrived
at
the
local
police
precinct
at
about
1:15
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day.
and
at
that
time,
the
interrogation
concerning
this
disappearance
of
sunday
graham
began.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
the
record
would
seem
to
indicate
that
he
accompanied
them
voluntarily,
sir.
but
we
say
that
whether
he
was
under
arrest
or
whether
he
had
gone
voluntarily,
that
the
fact
of
his
going
and
the
circumstances
that
took
place
from
that
point
on
are
to
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
ultimate
determination
to
be
made
by
this
court
on
the
question
that
we
say
is
presented
here.
but
we
do
--
we
do
say
that
so
far
as
the
police
officers
are
concerned,
they
expressly
testified
that
it
was
not
until
some
time
later
that
phillips
was
actually
placed
under
arrest.
the
testimony
in
substance
on
that
score
being
that
he
was
requested
to
stay.
that
he
could
have
left
had
he
indicated
his
desire
to
do
so.
that
he
would
not
have
been
restrained
in
his
leaving.
and
that
it
was
only
after
the
violated
dead
body
of
this
young
girl
was
found
that
he
would've
had
difficulty
in
leaving.
we
say
that
these
two
is
a
plot
of
the
totality
of
circumstances
such
as
this
court
has
referred
to
in
determining
the
effect
of
all
of
the
things
that
have
occurred
here.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that's
right,
sir.
there
is
no
question
about
that
but
we
say
that
whether
or
not
a
crime
had
in
fact
been
committed
prior
to
that
time
or
whether
there
was
knowledge
of
the
commission
of
that
crime,
it
becomes
immaterial
when
you
now
currently
consider
all
of
the
things
that
went
before,
after
and
immediately
at
the
time
that
a
confession
was
ultimately
obtained.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
it
is
true
that
there
was
an
interrogation
that
took
place
with
regard
to
phillips,
questioning
of
phillips
that
took
place
prior
to
the
time
when
it
became
known
to
the
police
that
a
murder
had
in
fact
occurred.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that
time
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that's
right,
sir.
that's
right.
and
that
questioning
concerning
the
missing
girl
took
place
between
1:15
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
and
sometime
at
about
3
o'clock
when
an
exculpatory
statement,
a
complete
denial
by
the
petitioner
was
obtained
by
the
police,
reduced
to
writing
and
signed
by
him.
it
was
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
that
the
dead
body
was
found,
found
who
have
been
violated
and
was
found
to
bare
the
clothing
and
all
the
other
identifying
material
that
indicated
that
this
was
the
body
of
sunday
graham.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
exactly,
sir.
but
the
exculpation
at
the
same
time
indicated
the
presence
by
the
petitioner
at
about
the
place
where
the
missing
girl
was
last
seen
alive
with
his
automobile
at
that
particular
location.
and
we
say
that
these
two
are
circumstances
which
eventually
we
--
i
intend
to
refer
this
court
to
in
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
police
were
in
a
position
to
make
a
charge
of
the
commission
of
crime.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
i
will
say
this
to
your
honor
that
while
i
make
the
concession
that
what
they
did
was
in
connection
with
the
investigation
of
a
missing
person
as
distinguished
following
investigation
of
a
crime
actually
known
to
have
been
committed.
whether
or
not
it
is
the
conventional
investigation,
we
say,
is
to
be
determined
from
this
and
the
other
circumstances
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
--
appearing
in
the
rush.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
judge
by
itself
and
in
isolation
or
--
at
this
particular
moment,
we
say
that
there
is
no
complaint
directly
urged
with
regard
to
the
police
activity
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
--
to
that
extent.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
we
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
--
we
say
exactly
that,
sir,
that
as
of
that
time,
there
was
someone
missing
and
they
were
bound
to
make
an
investigation.
immediately
after
4
o'clock
and
while
information
had
been
received
concerning
the
finding
of
the
violated
dead
body
of
this
young
girl,
the
questioning
was
resumed.
as
the
particular
officer
who
was
examined
on
this
score
stated,
"phillips
was
not
questioned
continually
but
on
and
off,"
but
he
says
also
that
phillips
continued
in
his
denials
of
any
complicity
in
the
trial.
now,
that
--
his
statements
were
entirely
exculpatory.
that
questioning
continued
from
4
o'clock
until
6:30
p.m.
of
that
day.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
6:30.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
we
say
that
the
undisputed
testimony
in
the
record
given
solely
by
police
officers
themselves
is
that
not
only
did
detective
rouffet
(ph),
the
one
who
began
the
investigation,
interrogate
phillips,
but
that
he
was
joined
then
by
a
lieutenant
carn
(ph),
a
captain
kloss
(ph)
a
--
and
a
detective
diggs
(ph).
and
that
they
were
occasions
when
diggs
in
particular
was
left
alone
with
the
petitioner
phillips.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
rouffet's
testimony
is
concerned
at
this
particular
time,
it
would
indicate,
we
say,
as
we
read
the
record,
that
not
only
was
rouffet
there
but
that
captain
kloss,
lieutenant
carn
and
detective
diggs
were
all
together
during
the
course
of
the
questioning.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
no,
this
was
a
lieutenant
(inaudible).
this
comes
shortly
after
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
lieutenant
(inaudible)
did,
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
i
don't
recall
that
to
be,
sir
--
so,
sir.
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
give
your
honor
direct
answer.
but
my
recollection
is
that
captain
carn.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
oh,
captain
kloss.
well,
that
captain
kloss
did
stay
in
for
a
short
time
and
left
but
he
returned
to
the
later
period
of
time
again,
sir.
now,
at
6:30
p.m.,
this
group
investigation,
this
group
interrogation
ended
according
to
detective
rouffet.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that
is
right,
sir.
and
that's
throughout
the
entire
state
of
the
record
would
appear
except
that
there
are
times
when
detective
rouffet
indicates
even
later
on
in
the
evening
that
more
than
himself
and
detective
stock
(ph)
and
others
were
in
the
room
and
took
part
in
the
questioning.
but
i
--
i
do
have
to
say
that
there
is
no
clear
statement
in
the
record
that
there
was
a
--
a
marathon
of
interrogation
here,
where
one
after
the
other
participated
but
rather
a
statement
only
that
he
was
continued
to
be
questioned
while
these
people
were
there.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
well,
we
--
we
say
that
the
record
doesn't
demonstrate
that
there
was
no
such
relay.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
the
record
rather,
we
say,
demonstrates
the
inference
that
there
was
but
there
is
no
clear
statement
in
the
record
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
--
on
that
score.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
exactly,
sir.
now,
at
6:30
p.m.,
detective
stock
arrived
at
the
precinct
and
at
that
time,
stated
to
phillips,
the
petitioner,
that
they
were
going
to
perform
certain
tests
and
examination
upon
him.
and
he
described
the
examinations
and
tests
as
being
those
where
they
would
examine
his
clothing,
take
the
parings
of
his
finger
nail
for
microscopic
examination
and
that
they
would
wash
his
privates.
shortly
after
that,
a
physician,
dr.
(inaudible)
and
lieutenant
pribell
(ph)
arrived
and
inspector
pribell
arrived
at
the
station
house
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
that
examination.
pribell
was
acquainted
with
phillips,
had
been
prior
to
the
time
of
his
arrival
at
the
station
house.
dr.
(inaudible)
says
in
substance
that
when
they
approach
phillips
for
the
purpose
of
having
this
examination
conducted,
yet
phillips
was
reluctant
that
he
said
that
he
wanted
advice
about
it,
that
he
didn't
think
that
the
police
had
the
right
to
conduct
such
an
examination.
and
inspector
pribell
then
requested
that
the
others
leave
the
room
and
leave
him
alone
with
phillips
so
that
he
could
discuss
the
matter
with
him
privately.
the
record
would
indicate
that
that
private
discussion
took
approximately
10
minutes
and
at
the
end
of
it,
the
other
detectives
and
dr.
(inaudible)
were
again
re-invited
to
enter
the
room.
when
they
did,
phillips
was
still
reluctant
to
undertake
the
examination
or
have
it
conducted
with
regard
to
his
personal
or
his
clothing.
and
it
was
only
at
that
point
that
--
that
inspector
pribell
in
his
discussions
with
phillips,
told
phillips
that
he
would
drink
some
of
the
solution
with
which
he
intended
to
conduct
the
washing
of
phillips'
personal.
and
having
invited,
he
stated
to
phillips
that
after
all,
it
was
not
harmful
to
his
personal,
and
the
testimony
would
seem
to
indicate
that
at
that
time,
phillips
stated
to
the
doctor,
the
inspector
and
the
others
that
he
would
undergo
that
physical
examination
and
the
other
tests
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that's
right,
sir.
and
he
stated
to
them
at
that
time
that
he
didn't
think
that
they
had
the
right
to
conduct
the
examination.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
but
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
the
examinations
were
negative.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
well,
we
say
that
it
helps
only
to
the
degree
that
it
required
that
his
clothing
be
removed
from
him
and
it
required
him
to
subject
his
person
to
the
examinations
by
the
positions
and
taking
along
with
the
other
continued
examination
that
was
conducted
by
the
police,
we
say
that
it
indicated
clearly
the
purposes
and
the
extent
to
which
the
police
intended
to
go
in
order
to
ultimately
obtain
incriminatory
statements
from
the
petitioner.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that
would
seem
to
indicate
such
a
limit,
sir.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
but
by
the
same
token,
when
the
--
when
the
--
the
offer
was
first
made
and
then
the
--
the
discussion
continue
by
a
person
who
wanted
to
speak
to
phillips
alone
and
by
a
person
who
had
been
acquainted
with
phillips
on
--
for
some
time
prior,
we
say
that
this
would
indicate
a
circumstance
that
could
--
will
raise
question
concerning
the
activity
by
the
police
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that
particular
time
was
7
o'clock
in
the
evening,
approximately
7
to
8
p.m.
by
8
p.m.,
the
entire
--
the
entire
examination
had
been
completed.
the
tests
were
--
the
result
of
the
test
was
not
known
to
the
police
until
sometime
thereafter.
now,
after
the
examination
had
been
made
and
the
test
taken,
a
stock
detective
stock
left
for
dinner.
detective
rouffet
remained
with
phillips
and
stated
that
while
he
did
not
interrogate
phillips,
he
may
have
spoken
with
him.
that
phillips
was
seated
in
a
chair
at
that
time.
it
was
about
9
o'clock
in
the
evening
when
captain
kloss
arrived
and
he
and
stock
again,
had
returned
from
dinner,
he
and
again
interrogated
phillips
for
about
an
hour
continuing
down
to
10
p.m.
on
that
day.
rouffet
joined
then
that
examination
also,
so
that
this
is
one
of
the
times
when
there
were
more
than
one
in
the
examination.
it
was
about
10:30
in
the
evening
when
it
was
learned
that
mrs.
graham,
the
foster
mother
of
the
violated
child
was
in
the
station
house
and
although
the
detectives
state
that
they
asked
phillips
whether
he
would
speak
to
mrs.
graham
and
he
gave
his
consent
to
that,
they
arrange
so
that
mrs.
graham
and
phillips
would
be
in
an
adjourning
room
with
the
door
open
so
that
he
could
be
observed
in
his
actions
while
the
conversation
continued.
it
was
in
about
11
o'clock
of
the
evening
of
that
day
that
notification
was
given
to
the
official
court
reporter.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
well,
we
say
that
here
was
a
man
who
was
subjected
to
an
interview
with
the
woman
whose
child
had
been
destroyed.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
exactly.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
maybe,
in
your
honors'
mind
i
made
a
poor
choice
of
words,
but
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
request
--
the
--
the
question
was
first
put
to
phillips
whether
he
would
speak
to
mrs.
graham.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
well,
we
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
except
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
other
testimony
on
that
score
whatsoever.
nor
was
there
any
testimony
concerning
the
state
in
which
mrs.
graham
was
at
that
particular
moment.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
except
that
we
say
--
we
say
to
this
court
that
under
that
--
having
in
mind,
the
fact
that
there
was
this
--
this
dispute
between
the
petitioner
and
mrs.
graham
that
there
was
the
expressed
threat
by
petitioner
against
mrs.
graham.
that
there
was
this
high
up
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
we
don't
say
that
there
shouldn't
be
any
credence
attached
to
it
to
this
degree.
that
certainly
we
feel,
we
feel
that
this
was
information
that
the
detectives
must
have
had
since
they
--
they
received
from
mrs.
graham.
the
description
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
well,
i
--
i
appreciate
--
i
appreciate
your
honor's
statements
on
that
score.
i
have
to
admit
that
we
have
a
different
view
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
i
--
i
say
to
your
honor
in
all
--
in
all
candor
that
i
have
nothing
else
on
that
point
that
i
can
offer
from
the
record.
i
say
that
at
11
o'clock,
notice
was
given
by
the
authorities
to
the
official
court
reporter
to
the
effect
that
they
would
desire
his
services
at
the
police
station
or
at
the
--
the
police
officers
in
connection
with
this
investigation
that
he
should
hold
himself
in
readiness.
that
he
was
not
required
at
that
particular
time.
and
there
was
sometime
after
that,
that
mrs.
graham's
brother
was
brought
in
and
the
record
is
--
has
force
information
in
this
connection
as
it
is
with
regard
to
mrs.
graham.
but
it
would
seem
to
indicate
that
thereto
inquiry
that
was
made
of
phillips
as
to
whether
or
not
he
would
speak
to
maddox
and
that
then,
maddox
and
phillips
met
in
this
adjacent
room
on
the
--
the
same
physical
circumstances
at
least.
maddox
apparently
spoke
to
phillips
until
approximately
1:15
on
the
morning
of
may
14
and
after
maddox
left,
detective
rouffet
resumed
the
question
--
his
questioning
of
phillips.
stock
also
questioned
phillips
along
with
lieutenant
cummings.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
they
say
--
stated
between
--
at
about
1:15,
rouffet
resumed
his
interrogation
with
phillips
and
so
did
stock
along
with
lieutenant
cummings.
it
was
about
1:30
a.m.
that
rouffet
left
the
police
precinct
and
in
his
own
language,
he
stated
that
he
was
a
very
tired
man.
now,
in
this
court
too
i
feel
that
i
must
state
to
this
court
that
the
record
would
indicate
that
rouffet
had
been
working
on
the
investigation
since
the
prior
evening
of
may
12.
i
don't
want
to
give
the
impression
that
rouffet
was
awake
only
during
a
portion
of
the
period.
but
there
is
some
reference
to
the
fact
that
he
had
been
working
on
the
investigation
since
the
evening
of
may
12.
rouffet
stated
though
that
at
that
time,
phillips
was
a
sleepy
man.
but
at
1:30,
cummings
and
stock
continued
their
questioning
of
phillips
and
continued
until
about
2:30
o'clock
at
that
morning.
it
was
at
that
time
phillips'
story
remaining
the
same
that
it
would
determine
that
he
should
be
removed
from
the
third
precinct,
the
local
police
precinct
to
police
headquarters
in
mineola.
and
it
was
shortly
after
3
a.m.
in
the
morning
that
they
arrived
at
the
police
headquarters.
there,
they
were
met
by
the
chief
of
police
who
went
over
the
entire
examination
and
questioning
of
phillips
all
over
again.
present
at
that
time
were
inspector
lita,
lieutenant
cummings
who
had
been
with
phillips
before
and
of
course,
detective
stock.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
we
have
done
that
and
set
forth
particularly
in
our
reply
brief
beginning
at
page
4.
but
we
say
there
that
as
of
that
time,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
start
with
approximately
4:45
on
that
afternoon,
but
we
say
that
as
of
midnight
of
may
13,
the
police
knew,
of
course,
of
the
fact
that
sunday
graham
was
missing
and
the
circumstances
under
which
she
was
last
observed.
they
had
the
description
of
her
clothing.
and
by
midnight
of
may
13,
they
had
an
identification
of
the
body,
and
they
have
had
an
examination
by
the
--
by
dr.
(inaudible)
at
the
morgue.
they
had
the
information
concerning
the
acquaintance
and
the
relationship
between
manita
graham
and
phillips
on
the
prior
occasions.
they
had
the
information,
we
say,
in
spite
of
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
implied
about
before.
we
say
that
they
had
the
information
concerning
the
threats
made
by
phillips
upon
manita
graham.
they
had
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
the
information
we
say
is
indicated
in
detective
rouffet's
statement
to
the
effect
that
he
received
the
information
from
manita
graham.
as
a
result
of
which
he
went
to
see
phillips
and
arrived
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
no,
there
is
no
direct
testimony
in
that
regard,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
except
that
i
think
--
i
think
we
can
draw
of
a
clear
inference,
sir,
that
they
also
knew
of
the
relationship
and
the
circumstances
that
existed
between
them.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
no
direct,
no
direct
testimony
on
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
there
is
no
testimony
on
that
score
at
all.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that's
right,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
we
raised
the
question,
sir,
but
this
court
did
not
permit
certiorari
on
that
--
on
that
issue.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
i
would
--
i
would
assume
so
from
the
order
of
this
court
on
certiorari.
we
say
that
it
is
--
it
is
again
another
element
to
be
considered
in
the
light
of
this
totality
of
circumstances
even
though
the
question
of
the
instructions
relates
solely
to
what
happened
judicially
after
the
arrest
and
after
the
confession
had
been
obtained
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
itself.
but
continuing,
as
of
midnight
on
the
evening
of
may
13,
they
knew
by
phillips'
admissions
that
he
had
been
in
the
neighborhood
where
sunday
graham
was
last
seen
entering
an
automobile
driven
by
a
person
of
his
description
and
an
automobile
of
the
--
of
the
kind
and
description
owned
by
phillips.
they
had
the
--
they
had
the
information
to
the
effect
that
there
were
peanut
shells
that
were
in
phillips'
automobile
and
which
had
been
found
in
the
hair
of
the
body
of
the
dead
girl.
they
had
the
information
concerning
the
finding
of
blood
beneath
the
body
and
had
obtained
from
phillips'
home,
his
underclothing
on
which
there
were
bloodstains
although
the
ultimate
testimony
given
by
the
experts
--
by
--
by
the
experts
who
submitted
to
analysis
was
to
the
effect
that
while
the
stains
were
a
blood,
it
could
not
be
determined
whether
it
was
human
blood
or
other.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
yes,
sir,
that
the
record
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
well,
we
say
that
the
--
so
far
as
the
bloodstains
are
concern,
it
wasn't
a
negative
finding,
it
was
merely
a
finding
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
exactly.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that's
right,
sir.
but
there
was
--
there
was
a
fact
that
although
they
could
not
matched
peanut
shells
the
one
from
the
other
that
they
found
peanut
shells
in
the
hair
of
--
in
the
hair
of
the
victim
and
on
the
floor
of
phillips'
car,
we
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
with
--
with
the
background
that
they
had
of
association
with
the
information
that
they
had
concerning
disappearance
with
the
admissions
that
they
had
by
phillips
as
--
as
to
being
in
the
neighborhood
where
the
disappearance
took
--
took
place
and
as
to
the
--
the
fact
of
the
peanut
shells
and
the
blood,
and
we
say
that
you
must
bare
in
mind
that
so
far
as
the
blood
is
concern,
the
prosecutor
in
the
examination
that
he
conducted
leading
up
to
the
confession
would
indicate
that
there
was
a
direct
claim
by
him
and
by
the
police
that
this
was
the
blood
of
the
victim.
we
say
that
while
the
proof
would
seem
to
be
that
they
had
not
verified
that
fact
at
that
time,
then
it
was
used
by
the
police
and
the
prosecutor
to
further
their
interrogation
of
the
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
didn't
--
he
didn't
say
it
in
that
--
in
that
fashion,
sir,
but
he
said
phillips
--
in
substance
he
said,
“phillips,
you
know
that
we
found
some
based
--
blood
on
your
--
on
your
shorts.”
mr.
henry
w.
schober
this
is
--
this
is
the
examination
by
the
district
attorney
at
the
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
--
conclusion
of
the
police
investigation,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that's
right,
sir.
and
it
is
significant
at
least
to
the
extent
that
something
that
might
have
some
information
that
might
have
existed
to
connect
someone
with
the
commission
of
the
crime
was
not
there.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
no,
but
the
record
does
not
demonstrate
that,
sir,
but
the
record
does
show
that
this
was
a
crime.
this
conviction
was
for
a
crime
committed
in
that
county.
we
say
that
the
police
certainly
are
chargeable
with
the
knowledge
and
notice
of
the
conviction
that
took
place
at
the
hands
of
their
own
department,
if
you
will.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
yes,
sir.
and
the
violation
for
which
he
was
returned
to
prison
was
committed
in
that
county.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
the
conviction
itself
took
place,
as
i
--
as
i
recall
approximately
1946,
approximately
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
i'm
sorry.
approximately
12
years
prior
to
the
crime
for
which
he
was
ultimately
convicted
here.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
oh,
that
would
have
been
considerably
more
than
three
or
four
years
prior
to
the
commission
of
this
very
crime.
it
would
have
undoubtedly
been
some
time
about
five
years,
five
or
six
years
prior
to
the
commission
of
this
crime.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
no,
but
there
is
affirmatively
in
the
record,
the
fact
that
inspector
pribell
knew
and
was
acquainted
with
phillips
prior
to
this
occasion.
even
there,
sir,
i
have
to
state
that
that
there
isn't
any
testimony
in
the
record
as
to
whether
or
not
pribell
had
that
information.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
yes.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
no.
one
was
the
conviction
of
crime
itself
and
the
other
was
the
adjudication
that
he
was
in
violation
of
his
parole.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that
was
the
one
for
which
he
was
charged
with
violation
of
his
parole
and
returned
on
the
original
sentence
for
which
he
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
two
separate
instances.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that's
right.
one
was
of
an
--
of
a
very
young
girl
and
the
other
was
of
a
young
lady.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
my
recollection
of
the
record
is
that
he
had
--
his
education
extended
just
to
the
primary
grades
that
he
had
not
--
that
he
had
not
gone
ahead
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
his
testimony
and
substances
to
the
effect
that
his
--
his
uncle
--
that
his
parents
having
turned
him
over
to
grandparents,
that
he
was
not
unable
to
complete
his
high
school
training.
there
is
indication
of
the
fact
that
he
did
attend
high
school
for
a
period
of
time
but
he
had
actually
accomplished
the
completion
only
of
his
elementary
training.
so
that
there'll
be
no
question,
sir.
i
--
i
do
definitely
state
again,
he
did
attend
high
school.
i
--
i
don't
want
to
have
at
felt
that
i
am
misstating.
i
know
that
he
did
not
complete
his
high
school
education.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
he
did,
sir.
that's
what
the
record
would
indicate.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
--
so
far
as
the
testimony
given
by
psychiatrist
would
indicate
that
he
have
a
high
intelligence
quotient,
but
that
he
was
subject
to
certain
personality
disorders.
we
say
that
those
things
is
being
subject
to
the
personality
disorder
of
things
that
or
is
a
thing
that
must
be
considered
in
determining
the
extent
to
which
he
could
resist
the
actions
of
the
police.
after
he
had
been
taken
to
police
headquarters
and
after
chief
panell
(ph)
had
gone
over
his
entire
story
again
with
him,
he
was
interrogated
for
about
an
hour
according
to
detective
stock
and
at
that
time
an
inspector
lita,
lieutenant
cummings,
stock
and
chief
panell
were
all
present.
now,
the
assistant
district
attorney
was
at
police
headquarters
at
that
time
but
did
not
enter
the
room
or
the
location
where
the
examination
of
phillips
was
being
conducted
at
--
at
that
particular
moment.
and
there
were
--
was
an
occasion
then
when
the
detectives
in
the
main
spoke
to
assistant
district
attorney
(inaudible)
the
--
the
ultimate
prosecutor
of
the
case.
and
there
is
no
clear
indication
of
the
person
or
persons
with
whom
phillips
was
left
on
that
--
at
that
time.
in
any
event,
it
was
at
about
4:15
a.m.
of
may
14
that
the
request
was
forwarded
to
the
report
(inaudible)
to
come
to
the
police
station
for
the
purpose
of
taking
a
statement.
and
it
was
about
4:30
that
the
assistant
district
attorney
(inaudible)
first
on
--
to
question
phillips
and
continued
examining
him
and
interrogating
him
until
5:10
in
the
morning
at
which
time
the
first
break
in
phillips
story
came
along.
now,
this
was
not
the
time
when
mr.
(inaudible)
stated
to
phillips
that
they
had
found
blood
on
his
underclothing
and
inquired
phillips
at
that
time
of
his
knowledge
concerning
sunday
graham.
it
was
then
also
that
phillips
stated
to
mr.
(inaudible)
that
he
was
sorry
and
then
asked
that
the
--
the
police
officers
be
brought
in
to
him
so
that
he
could
shake
their
hands.
that
he
did.
the
examination
continued.
the
complete
confession
was
obtained
from
him.
but
we
say
that
the
confession
itself
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
prior
interrogation
and
of
phillips'
statement,
not
disputed
or
anywise
answered,
that
he
had
been
subjected
to
brainwash.
that
he
was
parroted
what
had
been
told
to
him
by
the
police
officers
and
that
he
was
taking
the
easy
way
out
of
the
continued
interrogation
and
questioning.
we
say
that
reading
that
it
will
be
seen
that
his
answers
in
effect
state
that
the
factual
matter
included
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
in
his
questions
were
as
good
as
any
factual
matters
that
phillips
himself
might
state
in
his
answers
and
that
--
in
that
fashion,
we
say
that
it's
--
he's
born
out
that
he
was
accepting
the
version
that
was
given
to
him
by
others,
stating
that
his
mind
was
a
blank
concerning
the
occurrence,
he
was
merely
repeating
what
others
had
told
him
concerning
a
claim
occurrence.
we
say
that
--
considering
the
fact
that
he
had
been
awake
since
some
6
o'clock
was
6:15
on
the
morning
of
may
13
that
he
had
no
sleep,
no
food,
nothing
to
drink,
nothing
to
smoke
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
respondent
points
out
that
on
six
occasions,
there
were
request,
i
withdraw
that,
that
on
four
occasions,
there
were
requests
made
to
him
as
to
whether
he
desired
food
and
on
two
others,
their
food
was
offered
to
be
brought
to
him
that
nevertheless,
here
was
a
man
who
did
not
have
sleep,
rest,
food
or
drink
and
that
these
are
circumstances
to
be
considered
in
--
during
the
inferences
concerning
the
state
of
mind
in
which
he
was
as
the
result
of
the
questioning
which
began
at
1:15
of
the
afternoon
before,
his
state
of
mind
and
his
ability
to
resist
or
retain
and
keep
his
position.
we
say
that
under
those
circumstances
viewed
in
that
light,
there
can
be
no
determination
that
this
was
the
result
of
his
freedom
of
choice
that
he
had
any
freedom
of
will
in
the
matter
but
that
actually
what
was
occurring
that
was
--
that
he
had
been
subjected
completely
to
the
will
of
his
detainers
and
that
when
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
statements
by
officer
rouffet,
who
said
that
they
kept
him
for
the
purpose
of
extracting
a
confession
from
him
that
this
was
clear
proof
that
what
they
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that's
right,
sir.
but
in
part
included,
included
the
intent
to
extract
the
confession
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
--
for
him
--
from
him
and
detective
stock
who
claimed
that
his
detention
was
merely
for
the
purpose
of
continuing
their
investigation
said
nothing
further
concerning
any
reason
for
his
continued
detention
on
that
score.
the
fact
still
remains,
we
say,
that
the
information
that
they
had
at
4
o'clock
was
the
same
information
that
they
had
at
midnight
and
the
same
information
that
they
had
the
following
morning
at
the
time
that
he
was
booked
and
arraigned
except
for
the
confession
that
they
had
rung
from
his
lips
by
virtue
of
this
continued
examination.
we
say
that
the
delay
in
arraignment
while
of
itself
and
we're
mindful
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
concerning
delay
in
state
prosecutions
of
arraignment,
we
say
that
the
delay
in
arraignment
can
be
used
by
this
court
and
considered
by
it
in
determining.
again,
this
totally
of
circumstances
concerning
the
activities
of
the
police
and
their
express
intent
in
that
regard.
we
say
that
viewed
under
those
circumstances
and
in
that
light
that
we
are
entitled
to
take
the
police
at
face
value
and
that
when
detective
rouffet
said
that
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
they
wanted
to
extract
a
confession
from
him
that
were
entitled
to
view
all
the
other
circumstances
in
the
light
of
that
concession.
and
that
being
so,
that
there
are
sufficient
undisputed
conceded
facts
in
this
record
from
which
the
inexorable
conclusion
must
be
that
this
was
not
a
free,
voluntary,
uncoerced
statement
by
the
--
by
the
petitioner
but
was
rather
a
compelled
one,
that
its
introduction
know
by
his
objection
during
the
course
of
the
trial
was
improper
and
constituted
a
denial
of
his
rights.
we
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
we
ask
for
a
--
a
reversal
at
the
hands
of
this
court.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
as
a
--
there
is
evidence
but
it's
to
the
contrary.
there
are
--
there
is
testimony
by
the
police,
by
detectives
rouffet
and
by
--
detectives
rouffet
and
stock
to
the
effect
that
he
was
not
beaten
nor
did
they
hear
any
threats
expressed
to
him
while
they
were
present.
now,
we
point
out
to
this
court
that
there
were
a
number
of
police
officers
who
saw
and
were
in
phillips
presence
or
in
--
who
had
him
in
their
custody
on
occasions
when
stock
and
rouffet
were
not
present
so
that
any
denial
by
them
in
that
regard
is
to
be
taken
as
a
denial
only
of
circumstances
occurring
while
they
were
there.
on
the
other
hand,
there
--
there
are
the
statements
by
phillips,
the
petitioner,
were
on
cross-examination,
and
we
say
that
this
cross-examination
is
to
be
viewed
to
in
the
light
of
the
record
as
it
stands
at
that
time,
who
stated
that
he
was
pushed
around
and
forced
to
do
different
things,
that
he
was
brainwashed,
that
he
barely
parroted
what
others
suggested
to
him
because
it
was
the
easiest
way
out,
that
he
wasn't
able
to
resist.
now,
this
is
the
sum
total
of
testimony
concerning
physical
force
or
violence
used
against
him,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
no,
sir.
there
is
no
such
claim
made
during
the
course
of
his
direct
examination
but
we
say
to
--
we
say
that
that
too
must
be
born
out
in
the
light
of
the
manner
in
which
his
defense
was
conducted
after
a
point
of
time
in
the
trial
of
this
case.
the
record
demonstrates
clearly
that
at
the
outset
and
at
the
opening
to
the
jury
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial,
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
stated
that
he
was
going
to
demonstrate
that
phillips
was
beaten,
that
in
his
confession
was
extorted
from
him.
there
was
no
such
direct
examination
at
the
time
that
phillips
took
the
stance.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
they
were
told
that
--
they
were
told
that
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
--
in
the
--
in
the
opening
remarks
to
the
jurors,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think,
there,
the
--
the
reference
itself
was
that
he
--
that
counsel
would
call
36
witnesses
to
demonstrate
that
but
the
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
i
think
that,
your
honor,
that
--
that
when
this
court
examines
that
portion
of
the
record,
it
will
find
that
there
must
have
been
something
that
affected
counsel
for
the
defendant
as
a
result
of
which,
we
say,
that
the
defendant's
right
to
a
full
and
complete
examination
concerning
the
facts
of
this
matter
was
not
accorded
to
him
but
this
is
not
an
issue
for
this
court.
we
merely
say
that
it
is
a
matter
that
is
to
be
taken
into
account
for
it.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
if
your
honor
is
in
effect
asking
me
for
a
comment
on
that
score,
i
--
i
will
let
you
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
i
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
well,
i
--
i
still
again
--
mr.
henry
w.
schober
that
is
true,
sir.
that
is
true,
but
at
the
same
time,
at
the
same
time,
we
must
acknowledge
that
the
things
concerning
the
examination
of
this
defendant
appear
in
this
record.
mr.
henry
w.
schober
and
that
while
there
are
other
things
that
may
have
been
designed
and
that
maybe
there
was
much
to
be
designed
in
the
examination
whether
from
the
petitioner's
point
of
view
or
from
a
professional
point
of
view,
we
say,
we
are
not
entitled
to
raise
at
this
time
except
that
the
whole
record
maybe
viewed
in
its
entirety.
