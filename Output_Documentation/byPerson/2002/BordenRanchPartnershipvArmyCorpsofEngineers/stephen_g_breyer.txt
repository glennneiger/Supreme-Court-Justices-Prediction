justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
is
the
relevance
of
that?
that
is,
i'm
thinking
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--let
me
explain
how
i'm
thinking
of
this
case.
suppose
that
you
went
in
the
middle
of
lake
erie
with
a
big
punch,
and
you
punched
a
hole
in
the
bottom
and
all
the
water
ran
out.
would
that
violate
this
act?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
it
wouldn't
violate
the
act.
there's
nothing.
all
right.
now
suppose
you
went
to
lake
erie
and
you
had
about
1,000
dump
trucks
or
great
big
rakes
and
you
filled
up
lake
erie.
would
that
violate
the
act?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
absolutely,
okay.
so
now
what
you
have
is
you
punch
a
hole
in
the
bottom
and
you
bring
some
dirt
in.
all
right?
so...
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
brought
in
some
dirt
and
you
punched
the
hole.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
your
argument
is
because
you
only
brought
a
little
dirt
and
you
were
mostly
interested
in
punching
the
hole,
you
fall
outside
the
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
it.
okay.
well,
i
don't
know
if
we're
interested
in
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
you
violate
it
even
a
little
bit,
why
don't
you
lose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
it
doesn't...
i
mean,
why
is
a
truck?
does
a
truck
fall
within
it?
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
i
do
is
i
have
my
truck.
i
fill
it
up
with
guck
and
i
move
the
guck
over
to
the
lake
and
i
dump
it
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
is
the
truck
a
point
source?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
doesn't
say
confined
anywhere
in
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
word--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
is
rolling
stock?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
so...
and
it
doesn't,
however...
suppose
i
have
a
brilliant
idea.
instead
of
a
truck,
i
will
take
a
giant
rake,
17
feet
across,
and
rake
the
mountain
into
lake
superior.
all
right.
now,
is...
is...
that
doesn't
fall
within
this
just
because
i
thought
of
this
brain
storm
of
using
this
giant
rake
instead
of
a
truck?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
say
the
common
sense
question
is
whether
or
not
it's
exactly
the
same
for
all
intents
and
purposes
of
this
statute
as
a
truck.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
a
plow
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
is...
what
is
your
definition?
because
i
think
that's
actually
not
a
bad
point.
you
said
it's
a
conveyance.
this
is
not
a
conveyance.
the
dictionary,
i
guess,
defines
conveyance
as
a...
as
a
means
of
conveying,
and
it
says
conveying
is
cause
to
pass
from
one
place
to
another.
so
the
government
says,
well,
we'll
accept
that.
and
of
course,
if
you
take
that
literally
from
the
dictionary,
then
this
is
a
conveyance
because
it
is
a
means
of
conveying.
you
say
it
couldn't
be
that
broad.
i
have
a
better
definition,
more
consistent
with
what
the
paragraph
means,
and
that
better
definition
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
except
webster
would
seem
to
say
that
it
is
a
conveyance
because
it
fits
the
definition.
and
now,
so
you
don't
like
that
definition.
i
understand.
i...
i
see
where...
in
general
terms,
i
see
where
you're
going,
but
i...
i'm
asking
you
if
you
have
a
definition
that
would
help
you
short
of
webster's
definition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you...
you
want
to
read
it
as--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
a
person
has
boots
that...
and
he
regularly...
regularly...
people
on
this
farm
regularly
walk
through
some
poison
and
it's
on
their
boots.
and
they
walk
further
on
and,
lo
and
behold,
they
walk
into
the
place
and
poison
all
the
fish.
and
they
do
that
on
a
regular
basis.
are
the
boots
considered
a
conveyance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i'm
trying
to
ask--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
interested
in
the
question
of
conveyance.
are
the
boots
a
conveyance
where
the
effects
are
not
minimal
where,
for
example,
it
happens
regularly,
seriously,
destroys
the
fish
because
they're
walking
through
poisons?
now,
the
boots
are
not
normally
considered
a
conveyance,
but
they
do,
in
fact,
convey
the
poison.
a
plow
is
not
normally
considered
a
conveyance.
a
ditch
that
you
dig
to
plant
roses
in
is
not
a
conveyance.
but
any
of
those
things
could
in
a
subsidiary
way
convey
something
as
part
of
their
primary
nonconveying
objective.
now,
i
want
to
know
if
you
consider
those
subsidiary
things
where
it
is
serious
to
be
conveyances.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
view--
--never
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
about
the
question
i
think
justice
o'connor
asked?
and
i
think
justice
scalia
did
too.
at
least
i'm
waiting
with
bated
breath.
that
is,
what...
what...
suppose
we
agree
with
you
that,
well,
at
least
the
material
from
the
side,
at
least
the
material
from
the
bottom
was
an
addition
to
the
wetland,
brought
about
by,
let's
say,
this
conveyance.
all
right.
now,
what
do
we
have
to
do
with
this
case?
do
we
then
have
to
send
it
back
for
a
reassessment
of
penalties
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
of
the
passes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
he...
he...
i
think
your
opponent
said
that
the
penalties
rested
upon
17
passes
or
something,
and
i
guess
they
conceded
that
each
one
was
a
separate
violation,
which
they
may
regret,
if
this
is
the
rationale
anyway.
do
we
have
to
have
a
reassessment
of
the
penalty
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i
see
that,
but
i'm
still...
i'm
writing
the
opinion
let's
imagine.
i
say,
all
right,
they
brought
some
guck
from
the
side.
that
violates
the
statute.
they
got
some
from
underneath
the
bottom.
now
i'm
at
the
point
where
the
lower
court
wrote
most
of
its
opinion.
what
about
the
stuff
that's
just
sort
of
muck
down
at
the
bottom
and
it
simply
turns
it
over?
now,
do
i
have
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
that
does
or
does
not
violate
this
statute?
do
i
have
to
answer
that?
because,
after
all,
it
turns...
the
penalty
turns
on
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
i
do
have
to
answer
it,
what
do
you
say
to
their
argument
that,
yes,
if
you
churn
up
a
lot
and
move
it,
for
example,
over
to
the
point
where
the
river
is
running
in
and
dam
up
the
river,
that's
one
thing.
but
here
all
it
does
is
turn
it
around
in
place.
and
indeed,
it
doesn't
really
cause
any
harm.
it's
the
hole
that
causes
the
harm.
that's
their
argument
i
think
as
to
that
bit.
and
what
do
you
say
as
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
haven't
quite
answered
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
was
think
only
of
that
little
bit
where
the
plow
blade
is
taking
a
bit
of
muck
and
turning
it
over.
now,
in
respect
to
that
they're
saying,
one,
it's
a
small
amount.
two,
the
redeposit
of
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
harm.
the
harm
is
caused
by
the
hole.
now,
as
to
that
bit,
if
i
have
to
answer
the
question,
what's
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
raking
the
beach?
you
know,
there
are
people
here
worried
about
what
you're
going
to
do
next
and
say
they
can't
rake
the
beach
in
front
of
their
house
on
the
shore
of
the
lake.
what
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
but
they're
saying
we
go
out
every
morning.
we
like
a
neat
beach
and
we...
we
rake
it.
and
i
don't
know.
are
you
going
to
say
that's
de
minimis
or
not?
they
like
to
rake
their
beach.
they...
they
see
a
lot
of
muck
washed
up
from
the
lake.
so
they
go
out
there
and
they...
they
go
rake
the
beach,
and
they
throw
away
all
the
muck.
it
might
be
like
an
oil
spill.
i
don't
know.
it
could
be
terrible.
they
clean
up
the
beach,
and
they
say
on
your
definitions
what
you're
going
to
do
is
you're
going
to
subject
them
to
permits
every
time
they
want
to
stop...
clean
up
some
environmental
disaster.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they're
worried
that
they
might
be.
my
question
is,
if
we
decide
the
case
the
way
you
want,
are
we,
in
fact,
making
their
worry
justified?
