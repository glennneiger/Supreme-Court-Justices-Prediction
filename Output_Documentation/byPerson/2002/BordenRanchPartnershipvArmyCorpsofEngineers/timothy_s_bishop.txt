mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
army
corps
of
engineers
has
a
considerable
number
of
hurdles
to
clear
before
it
may
regulate
activity
as
a
discharge
under
section
404.
congress
specified
in
section
404
that
a
permit
is
required
for
an
activity
that
is
an
addition
of
a
pollutant
to
a
navigable
water.
that
addition...
that
added
pollutant
must
be
in
the
form
of
fill
material
or
dredged
material.
and
the
addition
must
come
from
a
point
source.
those
statutory
terms,
we
believe,
have
a
core
of
plain
meaning
that
excludes
a
farmer
and
rancher,
deep
plowing
in
a
seasonal
wetland,
to
prepare
the
soil
for
deep-rooted
crops.
a
deep
plowing
of
that
sort
does
not
add
fill
material
or
dredged
material,
and
it
doesn't
involve
a
point
source.
and
so
it--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--only
as
to
3
of
the
30-odd
wetlands
that
are
involved.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
and
that...
that
is
not...
and
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
judgment
below
or
of
the
penalty.
in
the
summary
judgment
ruling,
the
court
found,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
plowing
that
moved
material
that
was
already
in
the
wetland...
and
this
is
page
36
of
the
petition
appendix...
was
a
violation.
when
it
came
to
hearing
evidence,
for
that
reason
the
court
did
not
focus
on
the
question
of
whether
material
was
added
to
the
wetland,
as
the
government
says,
from...
from
outside.
the
penalty
in
this
case
was
based
on
358
rips,
passes,
of
the
plow
across
the
wetlands.
the
court
did
not
distinguish,
in
any
of
those
cases,
as
between
passes
that
brought
outside
material
into
the
wetland
and
those
that
didn't.
it
simply
was
not
a
focus.
this
was
not
the
basis
of
the
government's
argument
below.
this
is
entirely
novel.
it
wasn't
the
basis
of
the
district
court's
decision
in
this
case.
it
wasn't
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
if
you
look
at
page
6
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
furthermore,
we
believe
that--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--that
would
not
be
a
basis
on
which
you
could
affirm
here
because
that
was
not--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--and
we
believe
that
a
remand
that
focused
on
that
issue
would
show,
first
of
all,
that
there
were
on
some
occasions
a
minimal
amount
of
material
that
was
moved
into
the
edge
of
the
wetland,
just
on
some
occasions,
a
minimal
amount
that
would
be
well
below
the
amount
of
fill
that
would
have
fitted
at
that
time
with
on
the...
under
the
nationwide
permit
so
that
no
individual
permit
would
be
required
in
this
case.
it
would
also
show
that
the...
that
the
deep
plow
was
raised
on
many
occasions
before
the...
it
moved
from
upland
into
wetland,
and
there's
an
example
of
that
described
at
page
71
of
the
petition
appendix.
and
finally,
on
page
3
of
our
reply
brief,
we
cite
a
california
ag
extension
pamphlet
which
describes
in
great
detail
the
nature
of
the
soils
and
the
plowing
in
this
area,
and
what
it...
what
it
describes
is
that
when
a
deep
plow
passes
through
this
sort
of
clay
soil
and
it
then
rains,
that
the...
that
the...
the
clay
pan
seals
up
again
and
that
because
of
the...
the
nature
of
the
clay
pan,
there
really
is
no
homogenization
during
the
plowing
process
between
the
soils
above
and
below
the
pan.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
the
government
is--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--no.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
that
would
regulated
under
the
rivers--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--that
would
fall
under
section
404.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
we
bring
no--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--we
bring...
we
bring
a
little
dirt
in
at
the
margin.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
that's
right.
and
that--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--no,
no.
well,
the
purpose
of
the...
no.
the
purpose
of
the
act,
justice
breyer...
there
are
multiple
purposes
of
this
act,
but
the
purpose
to
preserve
the
nation's
waterways
is
achieved
through
a...
a
dual
or
perhaps
a
tripartite
process.
there
is
a
section
402
npdes
permit
that
is
regulated
by
the
federal
government.
there
is
a
section
404
fill
and
dredge
authority
that
is...
is...
that
is
handled
by
the
u.s.
army
corps
of
engineers.
but
that
is
only
part
of
the
picture.
the
government
through...
the...
the
congress
through
section
208
set
up
a
process
which
is
mainly
administered
through
the
states,
although
with
considerable
federal
assistance,
for...
for
regulating
nonpoint
source
pollution.
if
this
activity,
this
plowing
activity,
is
not
regulated
under
section
404,
it
is,
nevertheless,
regulated
by
the
states
as
nonpoint
source
pollution.
and
so
the
goal
of
the
act
to...
to
protect
the
nation's
waters
is
not
one
that
depends
on
the
federal
government,
and
in
fact,
we
think
here
that
to
give
a
broad
reading
to
the
powers
of
the
army
corps
of
engineer
under
section
404
by
straining
these
very...
these...
these
terms,
these
series
of
terms
that
congress
predicated
section
404
jurisdiction
on,
that
that
would
contravene
congress'
other
goal
in
section
101(b)
which
is
to
preserve
and
protect
the
primary
responsibilities
and
rights
of
the
states.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
we
don't
think
it's
permissible,
justice
ginsburg,
to
protect
wetlands
by
ignoring
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
because
congress,
through
using
the
terms
that
it
did,
imposed
limits
on
federal
power
that
preserve
and
protect,
as
101(b)
says,
the
power
of
the
states
to
regulate
nonpoint
source
pollution.
and
so
this--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--so
it--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--we
don't
believe
this
is
a
point
source.
we
don't
believe
it
involves
fill
material--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--or
dredged
material.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
it's...
it's
a
redeposit
of
the
material.
therefore
it
is
not
an
addition--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--of
material
to
the
wetland.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
the...
the...
judge
silberman
in
the
national
mining
case
said
that
the
terms
addition
in
section
404
and
also
the
concept
that
a
404
permit
is
for
the...
is
for
the
deposit
of
material
to
a
specified
disposal
site,
that
read
together,
those
show
that
congress
intended
that
there
be
a
geographic
or
temporal
separation
between
the
dredging
activity
or
where
the
material
comes
from
and
where
it
is
deposited.
so,
you
know,
if
a
bulldozer
digs
up
large
quantities
of
material
from
one
side
of
a
wetland
and
moves
them
to
another,
you
know,
perhaps
it
is
reasonable
for
the
agency
in
a
circumstance
like
that
to
say
that
there
has
been
an
addition.
even
in
a
case
like
deaton,
where
you
have
dredging,
the
dredging
takes
soil
out
of
the
wetland.
at
that
point
it
becomes
a
defined
pollutant
under
section
404
which
is
dredged
spoil,
something
that
congress
said
was
a
pollutant.
and
if
is
that
is
sidecast,
then,
you
know,
certainly
there
is
far
more
movement
of
the
soil
and
far
more
disturbance
of
the
soil
in
a
situation
like
that.
it's
lifted
out
of
the
wetland
and
it
is
moved
elsewhere.
but
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
plow,
a
deep
plow,
that
goes
through
the
soil
and
that
pushes
it
to
the
side
and...
and
moves
it,
but
it
stays
in
contact
with
the
soil
all
around
it
and
it's
simply
moved
in
small
degrees.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
they're
the
same.
they're
the
same
thing,
justice
o'connor.
and...
and
chiseling,
which
is
mentioned
as
a
form
of
plowing
in
the
regulations,
is
the
same
thing
too.
it's
just...
it's
exactly
the
same
implement.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
justice
o'connor,
our...
our
take
on
this
case
is
that
we
never
get
to
404(f),
that
this
activity
is
not
a
discharge
to
begin
with
because
it
doesn't
satisfy
the
requirements
set
out
in
404(a).
it
is
not...
it
does
not
involve
a
point
source.
a
plow
is
not
a
point
source.
this
is
not
fill
material.
it's
not
dredged
material.
it
is
not
an
addition.
therefore,
it
is
not
a
discharge.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
that's...
that's
our
argument.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
if...
well,
that
would
be...
that
would
be
an
issue,
but
as
i
say,
there's
no
finding
as
to
that
sort
of
a...
that
sort
of
an
addition.
and
i
don't
believe...
justice
o'connor,
let
me
be
clear
that
that...
the...
the
movement
of
material
into
the
margins
of
the
waters
here
would
not
be
a
discharge.
even
if
it
is
an
addition,
it
still
has
to
qualify
as
fill
material
and
as
dredged
material
and
as
a
point
source.
and
a
plow
simply
is
none
of
those
things,
and
i
hope
i
get
a
chance
to
explain
why
i
don't
think
it's
a
point
source.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
right.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
let
me
explain.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
that
a
point
source
is
a
confined
conveyance,
a
confined,
discrete
conveyance.
and
we
do
not
believe...
and
if
you
look
at...
and
then
are
examples
set...
set
out
in
the
statute.
and
this
is
at
5a
of
the
addendum
to
the
government's
brief,
which
is
a
little
easier
to
handle
than
our
petition
appendix.
a
point
source
is
a
discernible,
confined,
discrete
conveyance.
and
then
there
are
a
series
of
examples.
now,
the
government's
regulations
don't
define
point
source.
in
fact,
they
don't
even
use
point
source.
the...
the
404
regulations
don't
include
the
term,
point
source,
and
they're
not
in
the
1996
memorandum
to
the
field
in
which
the...
the
government
purported
to
explain
why
deep
plowing
is
covered
by
404.
but
we
think
that
these
terms
and
these
examples
show
one
important
characteristic
of
a...
of
a
point
source,
that
it
confines
the
material
that
it
conveys.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
a
dump...
a
dump--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--a
dump
truck--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--a
dump
truck
confines
the
material
and
it
conveys
it.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
yes,
it
does.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
it
says
a
discernible,
confined,
and
discrete--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
that's
the
government's
theory,
but--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--no,
no.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
the
government
has
never
adopted
that...
it's
just
come
up
with
that...
that
argument
for
the
purposes
of
this
litigation.
it's
not
in
any
regulation.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
i...
i
don't
think
it
is,
justice
scalia,
if
you
look
at
the
examples
that
are...
are
given
because
the
characteristic
of
all
of
these
things
is
that
they
confine
the
material--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--it's
defined
in
webster's
as...
as
the...
the
trucks
of
a
trucking
company
or--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--no.
i
think
the...
the
common
sense
question
is,
does
this
vehicle
confine
material.
there
are
some--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
but...
the...
there
is
a
list
of
examples--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
that
is
another
point.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
i
think
that
that
is
a
very
useful
term
for
us,
conveyance.
conveyance
certainly
gives
the
idea
of
something
that
is
intended
to
move
material
from
one
place
to
another.
and
a
plow
is
not.
a
plow
is
intended--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--the...
because
we're
not...
i
mean,
we're
not
in
this
business
to
convey
a
material
anywhere.
we're
in
this
business--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--justice...
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
that
in
any
normal
use
of
the
term
conveyance
that
you
would
include
a
rake
or
a
plow
that
just
pushes
material
a
short
distance,
perhaps
a
matter
of
inches
or
feet.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
i
mean,
that's
my
argument,
justice
souter.
i
believe
that
the
terms
confined
and
conveyance
in
the
statute
in
their
plain
meaning
and
as
they
are
elucidated
through
all
of
these
examples
that
are
given,
that
they
all
have
characteristics
in
common.
one
is
that
they
confine
the
material.
the
other
is
that
they
convey
it.
and
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
an
apt
description
of
a
plow
shank,
a
5-inch
wide
plow
shank,
pulled
through
the
soil
and...
and
the
movement
that--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
and
we
don't...
we
don't
think
that
the...
the
plowing
here
satisfies
any
of
these
terms.
so
we
don't
think
that
it's
a
point
source,
but
even
if
it
is
a
point
source,
we
certainly
don't
think
that
it's
an
addition
because
there
is
no
addition
to
the
wetland
unless
something
is
added.
and
all
we
are
doing
is
moving
soil,
be
it
up
or
down
or
sideways,
small...
to
small
degrees.
and
that
doesn't...
nothing
is
coming
into
the
wetland
from
the
outside.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
justice
ginsburg,
the...
the
statute,
section
404,
applies
to
two
types
of
pollutant
only,
and
that's
fill
material
and
dredged
material.
dredged
material
is
material
that
is
dredged
out
of
the
soil,
the
sort
of
thing
that
a
backhoe
does,
dredging
a
hole
and
lifting
it
up
out
of
the
soil.
the
agency's
regulations
define
dredged
material
as
material
that
is
excavated
or
dredged
from
the
wetland.
the
district
court
didn't
find
that
there
was
any
dredged
material
involved
here,
and
we
don't
believe
that
any
reasonable
reading
of
the
term,
dredged
material,
or
of
the
regulation
that
talks
about
excavating
and
dredging
from
the
wetland
could
describe
the
activity
of
deep
plowing.
that
leaves
fill
material.
fill
material
in
its
plain
meaning
is
material
that
is...
is
used,
is
moved
in
to
fill
a
gap
or
a
cavity.
it
was
defined
in
the
regulations
at
the
time
as
material
that
was
used
for
the
primary
purpose
of
replacing
an
aquatic
area
with
dry
land
or
changing
the
bottom
elevation.
as
justice
breyer
has
pointed
out,
if
anything
took
water
out
of
this
wetland,
it
is
the
activity
of
punching
the
hole
in
the
clay
pan
so
that
it
drains
out.
we
are
not
interested
in
filling
this
wetland
and
there
was
no
purpose
here
to...
to
use
the
material
to
replace
wet
areas.
and
in
fact,
it's
quite
irrelevant
to
a
farmer
and
rancher
if
the
topsoil
remains
wet,
and
in
this
area
it
does,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
remain
wet
because
the
clay
pan
seals
up
and
during
the
rainy
season,
there's...
there's
water
on
the
surface.
it's
just
not
our
purpose
to
do
that.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
it
does,
but
the...
but
the
pollutants...
the
pollutants
have
to
be
in
a
particular
form
in
order
to
be
covered
by
404,
and
that
form
is
fill
material
or
dredged
material.
so
it's
not
enough
to
say
that
there
is
rock
or
sand
involved
here.
it
has
to
be
in
the
form
of
fill
material
or
dredged
material
which
is
why
you
have
these
regulatory
definitions
of
those
two
concepts.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
in...
in
section
404(a)
on
page
2a
of
the
government's
addendum.
the
permits
are
issued
for
the
discharge
of
dredged
or
fill
material
into
the
navigable
waters
at
specified
disposal
sites.
the...
the
regulations
then
define
on
page
6a
and
7a
fill
material,
discharge
of
fill
material,
and
dredged
material
and
discharge
of
dredged
material.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
it
is...
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
irrelevant
because
under
section
301,
if
you
don't
get
a
permit,
then
what
you're
charged
with
violating
is
section
301(a),
which
is
on
page
1a.
and
that
talks
about
the
discharge
of
any
pollutant.
but
the
basis
on
which
this
case
has
been
litigated
is
that
we
needed
a
404(a)
permit
not
a
402
permit,
and
that
is
a
permit
for
the
addition
of
fill
material
or
dredged
material.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
it's
the...
well,
clearly
the
government
has
some
room
here,
but
what
we
do
say
is
that
a
conveyance
does
not
describe
that
no
one...
no
one
looking
at
a
deep
plow
would
say
that's
a
conveyance.
it
is
not
an
object--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
webster's
covers
this
situation.
a
conveyance
in
common
parlance
is
something
that
will
move
material
that
is
intended
to
convey,
to
transport.
i'll
have
to
find
the
page
of
our
brief.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
a
means...
i
mean,
this
is
what
i
have
from
webster's
third.
this
is
on
page
4
of
our
reply
brief.
a
means
or
way
of
conveying,
carrying,
transporting,
serving
as
a
means
of
transportation.
i
mean,
there's
the
idea
in
there
that
it's
a
purposeful
activity--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--to
convey
the
material
to
another
place.
and...
and
that's
not
just
want
a
plow
does.
a
plow
just
moves
through
the
soil
pushing
it
to
the
side
and
turning
it
over
and
cutting
through
the
soil.
i...
i
just
don't
think
any
common
sense
or
reasonable
meaning--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--would
treat
that
as
a--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--in...
in
mcc?
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
the
propeller
in
mcc...
this
is
a
huge
propeller
on
a
barge
in
a
very
shallow
navigable
stream.
the
propeller
cut
through
the...
the
material
at
the
bottom
of
this
stream,
picked
up
large
quantities
of
it
with
every...
with
every...
at
each
stroke,
and
propelled
it
out
of
the...
out
of
the
waters.
whether
or
not
that
is--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--no,
that's
not
what
it
was
designed
to
do.
and
i
think--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
yes,
it
gets
pushed.
it
does
get
pushed
to
the
side
within
the...
within
the
waters.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
mcc...
no.
mcc
is
a
suspect
decision,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it
fits
the
definition
of
the
point
source
or
dredged
or
fill
material.
i
mean,
it
is
more
like
dredging.
but,
you
know,
if
a
point
source
is
a
confined
conveyance,
our...
our
contention
is
that
it
must
transport...
purposefully
transport
material
from
one
place
to
another
and
it
must
confine
it--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--no.
that's...
that's
not
the
key,
justice
stevens.
the
key...
the
key
is
equally
that
this
is
to
pick
up
and
move
material
to
another
place.
we
don't
want
it
here.
let's
move
it.
and
it's
just
not
an
apt
description
of
what
plowing
does.
but
i
don't
want--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
i
think
primarily
what
happens
is
this
is
a
very
dense
clay
layer
that
the...
they
have
5-inch
shank
cutting
through
it.
and
i
think
the
most
apt
description
is
that
it
cuts
through
the
clay.
this
clay
is
heavy.
it
is
not...
there's
not
a
lot
of
homogenization,
as
the...
as
the
ag
extension
pamphlet
that
i
cite
in
the
reply
brief
says.
there's
not
a
lot
of
homogenization
at
the
lower
levels
from
below
the
clay
to
above
or
from
the
clay
above
because
of
the
nature
of
the
soil
and
because
of
the
nature
of
the
piece
of
equipment.
this
is
not
like
a
moldboard
plow
that
has
a
curved
shank
that
pushes
the
soil
up.
it's
a
cutting
device
that
is
intended
to
allow
water
to
hydrate
the
roots
and
to
allow
the
roots
room
to
grow.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
i
think
it's
a
shame
that
the
government
has
chosen
to
insert
at
this
level
for
the
very
first
time
this
idea
that
soil
came
in
from
outside
the
wetland.
on
page
36
of
the
petition
appendix,
the...
the
district
court,
in
describing
what
the
plowing
here
did,
said
that
it
broke
up,
mixed,
turned
over
material
already
in
the
pools,
swales,
and
intermittent
streams.
if
you
turn
to
page
86
through
91,
where
the
court
describes
in
detail
factual
findings
after
hearing
the
evidence
on
the
impacts
on
waters,
on
only
three...
as
to
three
of
the
jurisdictional
features
does
the
court
say
that
there
is
any
fill
coming
in
from
outside,
and
that
is
where
there
is
upland
plowing
parallel
to
a
drainage
that
pushes
a
small
amount
of
material
into
the
very
margins
of
the
wetland.
and
the
reason
that
the
court
didn't
need
to
get
into
this
is,
a,
that
it
had
made
a
legal
finding
to
begin
with
that
soil
disturbed
within
a
wetland
was
a
discharge,
and
b,
that
there
was
a
factual
dispute
here
about
the
extent
to
which
we
have
pulled
up
the
plows
before
we
entered
across
from
the
upland
to
the...
to
the
wetland.
and
the
court
didn't
want
to
deal
with...
with
that.
and
it
didn't
have
to
under
this
notion
that
if
you
disturb
soil
within
a
wetland,
that's
an
addition.
second,
i'd
like
to
point
out
on
page
8a
of
the...
of
the
government's
addendum
the
regulation
about
plowing.
plowing
means
all
forms
of
primary
tillage
including
moldboard,
chisel,
and
wide-blade
plowing,
discing,
harrowing,
and
similar
means
utilized
on
the
farm
to
break
up,
cut,
turn
over,
or
stir
the
soil
to
prepare
it
for
the
planting
of
crops.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
primary
i
think
means
just
preparation.
if
you...
you
have
to
go
to
the
end
and...
and
see...
it's
soil...
to
prepare
the
soil
for
the
planting
of
crops.
primary
is
the
initial
preparation
of
the
soil.
you
might
contrast
that,
for
example,
with...
even
though
harrowing
is
mentioned
here,
farmers
understand
that
harrowing
is
actually
a
secondary
form
of
land
preparation.
it's
like
a
large
rake
that...
that
clears
the
seed
bed
for...
for
seeding.
primary
is
the
first
movement
that
prepares
the
soil
for
accepting
the
crops.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
you
don't
need
an
exception
for
it.
our...
our
position
is
that
it's
not
a
discharge
and
so...
and
that
congress,
if
you
read
the
1972
legislative
history...
i'm
sorry
to
mention
it,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
but
it's
clear
that
they
did
not
intend
to
reach
agricultural
activity.
the
corps
in
a
dispute
with
the
epa
made
noises
between
'72
and
'77
about,
well,
we're...
we're
going
to
start
regulating
stock
ponds
and...
and
ordinary
farming
activities.
and
congress
reacted
to
that
by,
as
one
commentator
has
said,
a
provision
that
reflects
the
fact
that
it
didn't
think
that
one
stake
through
the
heart
of
the
vampire
was
enough.
this
is
a
belt
and
suspenders
provision.
but
what
it
does,
as
you
remarked
justice
scalia,
is
to
provide
an
exemption
for
agricultural
activities
that
are
discharges.
it
doesn't
change
the
definition
of
point
source,
fill
material,
dredged
material,
addition
in
any
way.
it
doesn't
change
any
of
the
operative
terms
in
the
statute
that
we
think
mean
this
activity
is
not
a...
a
discharge
to
begin
with.
and
the
exemption
also
mentions
other
activities,
seeding
and
cultivation
and
harvesting,
that
just
are
not...
i
mean,
these
are
not
discharges.
these
do
not
result
in
the
addition
of
fill
and
dredged
material
from...
to
the...
to
the
wetland.
and...
and
that
is
why
this
structure
is
what's
reflected
in
the
regulations.
the
regulation
on
page
8a.
it
says
plowing,
as
described
above...
i
mean,
they
purport
to
exclude
what
we
did
from
the
definition
of
plowing,
but
plowing,
as
described
above,
will
never
involve
a
discharge.
it's
not
a
discharge
to
begin
with.
you
don't
get
into
the
404(f)
exemption.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
thank
you.
