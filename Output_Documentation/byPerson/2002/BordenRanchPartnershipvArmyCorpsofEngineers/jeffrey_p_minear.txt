mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
clean
water
act
placed
no
regulatory
restrictions
on
the
vast
majority
of
acreage
that
petitioners
sought
to
subdivide
and
sell
in
this
case.
the
act
required
only
that
petitioners
obtain
a
federal
permit
for
those
few
acres
of...
of
wetlands
that
are
protected
under
the
clean
water
act.
and
those
wetlands
are
concededly
protected.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
are
waters
of
the
united
states
is
not
in
this
case.
petitioners
who
are--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
rather,
the
focus
here
is
on
the
activities--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--they
could
be
under
the
normal
farming
exemption.
and
we
have
three
questions
here,
so
i'd
like
to
try
and
proceed
logically
from
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
discharge
of
a
pollutant,
the
first
question
on
which
we
spent
most
of
the
time
discussing
this
so
far;
the
question
of
whether
that
discharge
would
be
covered
by
the
normal
farming
exemption;
and
then
finally,
the
question
of
civil
penalties.
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
discharge
of
pollutant...
pollutants,
the
clean
water
act
makes
clear
that
a
discharge
is
defined
as
any
unauthorized
addition
of
any
pollutant
from
any
point
source.
if
you
make
such
a
discharge,
under
301
you
have
violated
the
law.
you
have
two...
301
provides...
there
are
two
exceptions
to
301.
you
can
obtain
a
permit
for
normal
pollutants
under
402
or
you
could
obtain
a
dredge
and
fill
permit
for
fill
and
dredged
material
under
404.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the...
the
statute
states
that
a
point
source
is
a
discernible,
confined,
discrete
conveyance.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
it
is,
and
let
me
describe.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
let
me
describe.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
your...
your
honor.
the
equipment
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
bulldozer,
a
caterpillar
d10
bulldozer,
that
is
about
20
feet
tall
and
about
25
feet
long
and
typically
carries
a
16-foot
blade
on
the
front
of
it.
it
weighs
about
100,000
pounds.
in
this
particular
application,
this
earth-moving
application,
it
carries
what's
called
a
deep
ripper
or
shank
behind
it.
mr.
bishop
says
it's
5
inches
wide.
the
understanding
from
my
experts
is
that
it's
actually
more
like
a
foot
wide.
but
the
shank
is
about
5
to
7
feet
long.
the
shank
penetrates
deeply
into
the
ground
and
pulls
up
the
material
behind
it.
the
idea
here
is
to
disgorge
the
clay
material
that
lies
beneath
the
surface
of
the
soil
so
that
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
pulls--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
and
in
fact
the
district
court--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
the
district
court
opinion
states
on
page
70
that
material
is
moved
both
horizontally
and
vertically.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
i
disagree
with
this,
your
honor,
and
let
me
make
a
point
here
that
i
think
is
very
important
to
the
entire
dredge
and
fill
permit
program.
dredged
material
by
its
very
nature
is
typically
moved
from
one
area
of
a
wetland
and
placed
elsewhere.
think
of
it
when
we
talk
about
dredging
a
river
and
we're
dredging
a
channel.
we
are
taking
the
material
out
of
one
portion
of
the
waterway
and
putting
it
into
another.
so
that's...
this
idea
of
redeposition
has
been
a
part--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no.
i
think
that
mr.
bishop
would
agree
that
once
the...
what
happens
is
once
the
plow
penetrates
into
the...
the
earth,
it
stays
beneath
the
earth
and
it's
pulled
up.
and
what
happens
is
that
clay...
that
clay
pan
that
is
beneath
the
surface
is
raised
to
the
top,
together
with
other
material.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
it
was
one
that
was
resolved,
with
respect,
your
honor,
by
the
district
court
which
made
clear
that
the
purpose
here
is
to
break
up
the
clay
pan.
and
in
the
process
of
doing
that,
it
moves
the
earth
both
horizontally
and
vertically.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
and
that's
sufficient.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but,
your
honor,
the
purpose
here
is
not
what
matters.
it's
what
happens
in
the
wetland.
is
there
an
addition?
and
as
i
said,
there's
an
addition
from
three
different
perspectives.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
regulations
make
clear...
epa
has
made
clear
that
those
types
of--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
regulations
make
clear
that
de
minimis
movements
of
this
type
are
not
of
concern
to
the
agency.
rather--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--epa
has
indicated
that
walking,
bicycling,
driving
a
vehicle
through
a
wetland
is
normally...
has...
has
de
minimis
effects
and--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--can
it
be?
can
it
be
in
the
abstract
sense?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
they
meet
the
statutory
definition--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--because
although
as
justice
breyer
explained--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
is
a...
it
is
a
conveyance.
i
think
you...
you
need
to
understand
the
logic
that
congress
applied
in
enacting
the
statute,
and
that
was
to
define
all
of
these
terms
quite
broadly,
understanding
that
there
would
be
enforcement
discretion.
now,
we're
not
talking
about
de
minimis
activities
in
this
case.
we're
talking
about
filling
two
acres
of
wetlands
in
this
case.
and
we're
talking
about
activities
that
were
found
to
have
adverse
environmental
effects.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
he
can--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
was
the
concern
that
motivated
these
provisions.
congress
understood
when
it
enacted
the
clean
water
act--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
it
did.
and
i
think
what--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
indicates
is
that
congress
was
aware
that
plowing
was
a
point
source
of
addition
of
pollutants.
it
could
have
that
effect.
and
for
that
reason
it
created
an
exemption,
the
normal
farming
exemption.
but
that
exemption
itself
is
limited
and
the
regulations
that
epa
and
the
corps
have
issued
under
this...
under
this
normal
farming
exemption
make
clear
that
the
activities
we're
talking
about
here
would
not
be
covered.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
to
be
sure--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
activities
that
are
covered
under
the
normal
farming
exemption
are
ongoing
agricultural
activities,
part
of
a
regular
farming
activity,
and
also
activities
that
ultimately
under
the
recapture
provision,
first,
do
not
change
the
use
of
the
land
and
do
not
result
in
converting
a
wetland
to
dry
land.
now,
the
agency
was
charged
with
responsibility
for...
for
fleshing
out
the
scope
of
the
normal
farming
exemption,
and
it
made
clear
that
a
farmer
who
continues
to
engage
in
practices
that
he's
always
engaged
in,
including
normal...
normal
plowing--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
this
land--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
that
point.
we're
now
back
to
question
1
and
talking
about
the
question
of
addition
which
is
fundamental
to
the
idea
of
a
discharge.
our
view
is
that
there
were
additions
from
three
sources
here.
first,
there
was
addition
by
material
being
moved
from
the
upland
into
the
wetland.
counsel
states
that
that
occurred
in
only
three
cases.
the
record
actually
shows
that
it
occurred
in
at
least
33
of
the
40
wetlands
that
are
involved
here.
the
district
court
made
reference
to
it
only
in
those
three
cases
where
it
was
the
only
movement
of
that
material.
but
it's
easy
to
see
that
the
three
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
district
court's
opinion
refer
to
those
cases
where
the
ripper
passed
next
to
a
wetland
but
didn't
go
in
and
pushed...
nevertheless,
pushed
soil
into
the
wetland.
the
same
thing
would
happen
in
those
areas
where
the
ripper
actually
intruded
through
the
wetland
as
well.
so
in
the
case
of
all
of
the...
the
areas,
the
29
areas
that
were
filled,
all
of
them
had
movement
of
material
from
upland
into
the
wetlands.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
the...
in
talking
about...
before
when
i
spoke
about
the
dredged
material,
about
how
material
is
moved
from
one
place
to
the
wetland
to
another
place,
that
is
a
regulable
redeposit
that
is
covered
by
the
act.
and
we
believe
the
fourth
circuit's
reasoning
in
deaton
is
quite
persuasive
on
this.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
as
i
said
before,
your
honor,
not
only
do
we
have
redeposits.
we
also
have
the
material
that
moved
from
the
upland
into
the
wetland.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
we
also
have
material,
if
i
may
finish--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
before
we
get
to
the
penalty
part,
if
i
could,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
point
to
one
area...
other
area
in
which
material
is
moved
into
the
wetland,
and
that
is
material
that's
beneath
the
clay
pan
that
was
segregated
and
separated
by
this
impermeable
clay
pan
and
instead
was
pulled
up
and
put
into
the
wetland
as
well.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
you
would
not
be
regulated
by
section--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
we're
paying
attention
to
the...
the
strict
language
of
the
statute.
the
statute
is
concerned
with
additions.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
in
this
case
it's
fair
to
describe
it
as
going
to
the
bottom
of
the
clay
pan
because
that's
what's
actually
holding
the
water
in
the
area.
in
other
cases,
it
might
be
different.
there's
vast
hydrological
variation.
in
some
places
wetlands
are
sustained
by
the
groundwater
that
comes
up
from
beneath,
and
so
it's
very
difficult
to
talk
about
where
the
bottom
of
the
wetland
would
be--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
your
honor,
respectfully
what
we're
asking
you
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
recognize
that
the
wetland
does
go
to
that
clay
pan.
in
other
cases
it
might
well
be
different.
but
we
need
to
deal
with
the
facts--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
this
case
that's
correct.
but
in
other
cases
such
as
in
riverside
bayview,
the
case
that
this
court
previously
addressed
wetlands,
there
the
wetland
was
actually...
was...
received
water
from
beneath,
and
it
did
not
have
a
sustaining
clay
pan.
there's
simply
variations
in
the
types
of--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we're
saying
that
the
clay
pan
is
a
part--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
the
area
beneath
it
is
not.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
there's...
there's
soil
beneath
the
clay
pan
that
he
pulled
up.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
record
that
he
must
have.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
i
think
you
can
affirm
on
that
basis
because
those
two
sources
were
present
with
regard
to
all
of
the...
all
of
the...
the
wetlands
that
were--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--all
of
the...
all
of
the
wetlands
that
were
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
don't
think
that
a
reassessment
of
the
penalty
would
be
necessary
even
if
you
took
this
alternative
position.
and
let
me
say,
first
of
all,
the
penalty
here
was
based...
what's
in
contention
is
how
one
calculates
the
maximum
penalty
that
can
be
imposed
on
a
party
in
one
of
these
cases.
and
there's
a
fair
amount
of
flexibility
in
determining
how
that
might
be
done.
in
this
case,
the
parties
had
agreed
below
that
each
pass
of
the
ripper
was,
in
fact,
a
violation.
the...
the
district
court
then
determined
the
maximum
penalty
by
taking
the
number
of
passes
of
the
ripper
and
multiplying
it
times
the
maximum
penalty.
but
it
did
not
impose
that
penalty.
instead,
it
looked
to
the
specific
statutory
criteria
that
govern
the
application
of
the
penalty
provision.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'm
not
sure
the
penalty
turns
on
it.
we
would
say
that
if...
obviously
this
court
has
discretion
to
determine
this...
the
types
of...
the
type
of
remand
it
wants
to
send
back.
we
do
think--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
would
say,
first,
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
environmental
harm
here.
on
page
106
of
the
petition
appendix,
it
makes
note
that
these
types
of
activities
did
cause
environmental
harm.
with
regard
to
the
penalty
assessment,
i
would
look
to
the
fact
that
the...
the
district
court
considered
the
seriousness
of
the
violation,
the
bad
faith
activities--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
my
response
is
that
deposit,
that
turning
over
material
that's
in
place,
can
still
cause
environmental
harm
that
subjects
them
to
a
penalty.
imagine
if
in
that
muck,
in
that
material,
there
are
entrained
heavy
metals,
arsenic,
the
types
of
materials
that
are
filtered
out
through
the
normal
wetland
process.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
they...
they
have
added
those
to
the
wetland
if
they've
in
fact
been
released
from
a
situation
where
they're--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
as
the
fourth
circuit
explained
in
deaton,
that
when
you
take
material
and
you
physically
change
its
situation,
if
you
change
it
from
an
aerobic...
an
anaerobic
environment
to
an
aerobic
environment,
if
you
change
its
reduction
oxidation
potential,
these
are
the
reasons
why
we
have
a
permit
because
we're
concerned
about
these
types
of
activities--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
and
as
i
said
before,
they
must
have
contemplated
that
an
addition
included
a
redeposit
because
otherwise
the
idea
of...
of
regulating
dredging
and
the
placement
of
dredged
material
wouldn't
have
made
any
sense.
congress
was
aware
of...
chose
its
terms
quite
carefully.
it's
just
that
it
understood
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is...
that
is
possible,
but
that
is
very
unusual.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
seems--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
seems
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
enacted
provisions
regulating
dredged
and
fill
material
that
excluded
the
most
common
form
of
dredging,
which
is
to
take
material
from
one
area
of
the
water
body
and
move
it
elsewhere.
in
any
event,
it's
important
to
remember
that
the
pollutants
we're
talking
about
here
include
sand,
gravel,
rock,
and
biological
material.
these
are
materials
that
are
defined
within
the
statute
as
pollutants.
clearly
congress
recognized
the
dangers
of
moving
these
materials
about--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
answer
again
is
found
in
the
agency's
regulations
which
make
clear
that
de
minimis
disturbances
simply
do
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
violation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think,
your
honor,
the
question
is
have
they
been
subjected
to
that
type
of...
of
regulation,
and
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
and
again,
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
what
the
agency
is
fully
concerned
with
are
those
types
of
serious
violations
that
cause
real
environmental
harm.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think,
your
honor,
then
if
they
had
not
intended
that
there
would
be
enforcement
discretion
exercised
by
an
agency,
they
wouldn't
have
prohibited
the
addition,
any
addition,
of
any
pollutant
from
any
point
source.
they
made
the
net
that
was
covered
here
quite
broad
because
they
realized
there's
a
vast
variety
in
the
types
of
environmental
harm
that
might
be
caused--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
they...
they
have
had
ample
opportunities
to
change
the
regulations...
or
to
change
the...
the
terms
of
the
statute.
the
statute
has
been
revised
three
times,
and
they've
been
quite
specific
in
what
they've
done.
the
normal
farming
exemption
is
a
good
example.
congress
could
have
simply
exempted
all
farming
activities
from
coverage
under
section
404
or
the
clean
water
act
itself.
instead,
it
drew
a
very
specific
line
in
this
case
and
it
said
that
we
are
only
restricting
normal
farming
activities
and
we're
subjecting
them
to
a
recapture
provision.
that
recapture
provision
applies
whenever
the
activity,
even
if
it's
simply
plowing,
results
in
the
change
in
use
of
the
property
and
also
results
in
a
diminishment
of
the
waters
of
the
united
states,
if
it
actually
fills--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
the...
the
plow
would
be
a
point
source.
and
this
is
the
reason
why
congress
enacted
the
normal
farming
exemption.
it
realized
it
defined
these
terms
quite
broadly,
and
it
wanted
to
provide
sensible
exemptions.
but
it
drew
limits
on
those
exemptions
to
avoid
covering
situations
like
we
have
here
where
we're
not
talking
about
a
yeoman's
plow,
but
rather
we're
talking
about
a
100,000
pound
bulldozer
pulling
a
7-inch...
7-foot
long
shank
through
a
wetland
area.
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
too
that
this
lawsuit
could
have
easily
been
avoided.
the...
the
parties
were...
were...
discussed
this
issue
on
a
number
of
occasions,
and
the
corps
made
quite
clear
that
they
were
not
subject
to
a
permit
provided
they
simply
avoided
these
small
wetland
areas,
what's...
in
the
case
of
the
parcels
at
issue
here
are
about
1
percent
of
the
property.
it
was
easy
enough
to
simply
mark
these
areas
and
have
the
contract
rippers
who
came
through
avoid
those
areas.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
decided
not
to
do
that.
they
decided
to
disregard
the
law
and
the
fact
is
that
this
suit
and
10
years
of
litigation...
excuse
me...
8
years
of
litigation
is
the
result.
the
fact
is
that
this
is
a
quite
sensible
program.
the
corps
and
epa
have
applied
it
quite
sensibly,
and
i
think
that
their
actions
in
this
case,
if
you
look
at
the
record,
were
really
quite
reasonable.
now,
i
would
like
to
touch
back,
since
we've
covered
a
lot
of
material
here,
just
to
go
over--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
there's
one
normal
farming
exemption.
that
is
contained
in
section
404(f)
of
the
statute,
and
that
is
found
on
pages
2a
and
3a
of
our--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
correct.
and
so
what
this
does
is
it
exempts
the
party
from
having
to
get
a
section
404
permit
for
activities
that
would
otherwise
constitute
dredge
or
fill
activities.
and
the
fact
that
congress
has
chosen
to
exempt
activities,
including
specifically
plowing,
indicates
that
congress
understood
that
plowing
could
result
in
a
point
source
addition
of
pollutants.
now,
what
congress
additionally
did
is
it...
it
states
on
the
carryover...
there's
a
number
of
other
matters
that
are
exempted
as
well.
it
indicates
that
these
activities
are
not
regulated
under
section
301
or
section
404
or
section
402,
for
that
matter.
but
then
on
the
paragraph
on
page
4a,
it
recaptures
those
provisions
when
they
result
in
a
change
of
use,
when
someone,
such
as
in
this
case,
decides
to
take
a
ranch
and
subdivide
it
and
sell
it
as
farmettes.
and
it...
and
even
that
recapture
provision
only
applies
when
it
reduces
the
reach
of
waters,
which
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
as
the
district
court
found,
these
waters
were
filled.
they
are
no
longer
wetlands,
and
the
idea
that
these
areas
are
going
to
be
resealed
finds
no
support
in
the
record.
the
district
court
found
here
that
what
were
once
wetlands
are
now
orchards.
these
are
not
areas
that
include
wetland...
or
have
wetland
characteristics
any
longer.
i
would
simply
like
to
touch
on...
since
we...
we
have
bounced
around
among
the
three
issues
here
quite
a
bit,
i'd
like
to
simply
say
a
few
more
words
about
the
civil
penalty
provision
because
i
think
it's
important.
the
legal
issue
that's
before
the
court
on
the
civil
penalty
is...
is
whether
a
penalty
ought
to
be
assessed
in
terms
of
determining
the
maximum
penalty
on
a
per-day
basis
or
on
the
basis
of
the
number
of
violations
per
day.
and
the
congress
made...
made
quite
clear
that
it
wanted
the
latter
to
be
the
basis
for
determining
the
maximum
civil
penalty.
it
amended
the
statute
in
1987
to
eliminate
any
ambiguity
that
might
exist
with
regard
to
the...
to
that
provision,
and
it's
quite
clear
that
it
does
apply
to
every
violation
each
day.
now,
it
takes
into
account
that
some
violations
can
be
continuing
and
go
on
for
a
long
period
of
time.
and
those
are
treated
as
receiving
a
$25,000
a
day
penalty.
but
in
the
case
of
the
violations
we
have
here,
they
all
occurred
in
one
day
on
the
basis
the
district
court
analyzed
the...
the
problem.
finally,
i'd
like
to
make
the
point
that
the
district
court
needs
to
have
a
great
deal
of
discretion
in
determining
how
to
apply
the
penalty
provisions
that
are
involved
here.
there
are
different
ways
to
calculate
violations,
determine
what
is
the
appropriate
measure
of
violations,
but
ultimately
the
fairness
turns
on
the
district
court's
judgment
of
the
individual
penalty
factors
that
are
considered
here.
in
this
case,
the
court
took
into
account
all
those
factors,
including
the
economic
benefits
that
the
party
received
by
avoiding
its
legal
obligations
in
this
case.
it's
important
to
remember
there
are
land
developers,
ranchers,
and
farmers
out
there
that
do
comply
with
the
statute,
that
do
comply
with
the
regulations,
and
they
are,
in
effect,
penalized
if
in
fact
people
who
ignore
the
law
are
allowed
to
go
forward
and
not
be
subject
to
a
substantial
penalty
in
cases
in
which
they
have
violated
the
law.
in
this
case
the
penalties
are
less
than
what
actually
would
be
necessary
to
recoup
the
economic
benefit
that
they
received
according
to
the...
the
facts
that
the
district
court
put
forward.
the
court
of
the...
or
excuse
me...
the...
the
government
put
forward.
the
district
court
recognized
there
was
some
uncertainty
with
regard
to
determining
economic
benefit,
but
nevertheless
i
think
chose
a
very
reasonable
approach
here
in
terms
of
requiring
both
a
mitigation
remedy
and
also
a
substantial
civil
penalty.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
