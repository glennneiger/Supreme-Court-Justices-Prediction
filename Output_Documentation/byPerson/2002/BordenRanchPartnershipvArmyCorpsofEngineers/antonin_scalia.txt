even
so,
if
we
agreed
that
that's
a
proper
basis--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
we'd
have
to...
we'd
have
to
remand
for
that
to
be
considered?
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
confining.
not
confining.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
a
pretty
darned
good
one
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
isn't...
isn't
your
point
whether
it's
a
conveyance?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
rake
is
a
conveyance.
it
is
meant
to
move
the
dirt
down,
and
i
suppose
your
point
is
that
the...
the
plow
is
not
intended
to
convey
the
dirt
anywhere
except
up
and
down.
some
of
it
may
accidentally
go
sideways,
but
that's
not
what
the
plow
is
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you...
you
could
say
that
it
does
convey.
it...
it
conveys
mostly,
almost
entirely,
up
and
down
and
maybe
a
little
bit
sideways.
but
to
the
extent
that
it
does
convey
a
lot
up
and
down,
which
is
its
purpose,
it
hasn't
made
any
addition.
that
would
be
your
point
for
the
up
and
down.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
still
stuck
with
the
sideways,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
were
quoting
the...
the
regulations
as
to
the...
the
definition
of...
of
dredged
material,
but
the
definition
in
the
statute
of
pollutant
includes
rock
and
sand.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
do
i
get
that
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
definition...
for
present
purposes
the
definition
of
pollutant
is
irrelevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
must
say
i
never
thought
a
plow
was
a
conveyance
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what
it
was
designed
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
meet
your
definition.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the...
the
legislation
doesn't
require
that
these
wetlands
be...
be
left
fallow.
you...
you
could
use
them
agriculturally
and...
and
they
would
still
be
wetlands
and
you
wouldn't
be
violating
the
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
if...
so
long
as
the
material
that...
that
moved
a
couple
of
inches
or
even
a
couple
of
feet
horizontally
is
moved
from
within
the
wetlands
to
within
the
wetlands,
you
haven't
added
anything
to
the
wetlands,
have
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
says
that's
not
the
purpose.
he
says
the
purpose
is...
it
doesn't
do
that.
it
just
breaks
it
up.
i
mean,
maybe
some
of
it
come,
but
that
the
operation
is
not
intended
to
mingle
the
clay
with
the...
with
the
topsoil.
just
to
break
up
the
clay.
i
mean,
this
is
apparently
a
dispute
between
the
two
of
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
doesn't
deny
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
you're...
you're
describing
the
moving
it...
of
it...
of
it
at
least
vertically
as
being
the
whole
purpose
of
the
operation.
and...
and
he
says
that's
not
the
case,
that
what
they
want
to
do
is
break
up
the
clay
and
a
little
bit
may...
may,
indeed,
come
higher
in
the
course
of
that.
but
that's
not
what
it's
designed
to
do
unlike
the
kind
of
plow
you...
i'm
used
to
seeing,
you
know,
that
you
carry
behind
a
horse
and
it's...
it's
shaped
in
such
a
way
that
indeed
the
soil
comes
up.
this
is
not
that
kind
of
a
plow.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
there's
an
addition
if
i'm
walking
through
a
wetland
that...
you
know,
that...
that
happens
to
be
dry
at
this
time
a
year
and
i
kick...
i
kick
a
dirt
ball
and
it
moves
to
another
part
of
the
wetland.
i
guess...
i
suppose
that's
an
addition
too,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
lucky
for
me
my
foot
is
not
a
conveyance.
maybe
it
is
a
conveyance.
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee
whiz,
congress
should
have
said,
you
know,
by
conveyance
or
otherwise
then.
why
did
it
say,
you
know,
it
has
to
be...
it
has
to
be
a
conveyance?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
a
boot
is
not
a
conveyance,
it's
not
a
conveyance.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you...
you
say
filling
as
though,
you
know,
they're
not
going
to
be
wetlands
anymore,
but
that's
perfectly
okay.
he
can
make
them
not
wetlands
anymore
so
long
as
he's
doing
it
by
normal
farming.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
evil
here
is
not
that
this
is
taken
out
of
our
national
deposit
of
wetlands.
that
isn't
the
evil,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
already
a
stretch.
i
mean,
you
know,
with
that
you'll
say,
well,
literally
you're
not
adding
anything
to
the
wetlands
just
to
move
the...
the
mud
from
one
portion
to
another.
but
you
have
this
big
dredging
operation
and
it
does
disturb
everything
and
you
move
it.
so,
yes,
i'll
go
along
with
you
on
that.
but...
but
then,
you
know,
that's
not
enough
for
you.
now
we
have
to
generalize
from
that
and
say
that
any
movement
of
anything
within
the
wetlands
is
also
an
addition
to
the
wetlands.
and...
and
that
brings
you
to
this
case.
and
i
think
it
is
fanciful
to
think
that
anything
has
been
added
to
the
wetlands
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see
that,
but...
but
not
all
of
the
penalties...
we're
going
to
get
to
the
penalty
part.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
$25,000
for
each
pass,
and
it
hasn't
been
established
that
every
one
of
these
passes
had
that
effect.
and...
and
he
says
most
of
them
didn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
can
mine
under
a
wetland,
and...
and
i'm
not
disturbing
the
wetland.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that...
is
that
the
position
the
government...
the
government
wants
to
take,
that
you...
anything
that's
under
the
wetland,
you
know,
go...
go
for
it?
it...
it
doesn't...
doesn't
involve
the
wetland.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
far
down
does
a
wetland
go?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
willing
to
have
us
say
that
in
this
case,
that
wetlands
only
go
down
as
far
as
whatever...
whatever
stratum
holds
the
water
in
the
wetland,
and
everything
else
is
not
included.
below
that
is
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
sustaining
clay
pad
is
not
part
of
the
wetland
you're
now...
you're
now
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
part
of
the
wetland.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
he--
justice
antonin
scalia
--was
he...
was
he
pulling
up
soil
from
beneath
the
clay
pan?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
have
added
those
to
the
wetlands.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
in
the
wetland
before,
and
they're
still...
and
they're
still
in
the
wetland.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
it's
well
to
be
concerned
about
it,
but...
but
congress
did
use
the
term
addition...
addition...
to
the
wetlands.
i
mean,
don't
words
mean
anything?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
could
have
meant
dredged
from
elsewhere,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it's
possible,
it...
it
would
mean
addition--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it
was
dredged
from
elsewhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
congress
wanted
the
homeowner
to
have
to
worry
about
raking.
i
don't
think
they
wanted
to
place
the...
the
homeowner
at
the...
at
the
mercy
of
this
benign
agency
who
will
say,
well,
there,
there,
don't
worry.
we
won't
get
you
for
raking.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
doubt
whether
raking
was
intended
to
be
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
they
didn't
think
a
rake
was
a
point
source
as
i
don't.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
farming
exception
is
there?
is
there
just
one
or
are
there
several
of
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
but,
you
see,
that's...
that's
not
an
exception
for...
for
normal...
it's
an
exception
from
the
discharge
of
dredged
or
fill
material.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
need
the
exception
for
it?
that's
what
puzzles
me.
