mr.
bishop,
you
may
proceed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
that
exactly
what
happens
here,
that
the
deep...
deep
rigging
or
whatever
you
call
it...
the...
it
breaks
up
the
clay.
there's
a...
a
body
of
clay,
and
then
the...
the
broken-up
clay
finds
its
way
into
the
water.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
the
exact
parallel
to
the
other
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
key
to
your
argument,
if
i
understand
it,
is
the
purposeful
thing.
they
didn't
really
intend
to
do
this.
it's
just
a
byproduct
of
what
they're
doing,
and
therefore
there's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
minear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
bishop,
