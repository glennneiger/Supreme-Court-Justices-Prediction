mr.
bishop,
will
you
explain
something
to
me?
and...
and...
on
a
most
basic
level,
if
what
the
concern
was
it
was
to
preserve
wetlands
and
not
have
them
converted
into
dry
lands,
what
difference
should
it
make
if
the
conversion
comes
about
through
redeposit,
shaking
all
the
stuff
up,
turning
it
upside
down,
but
what
you're
ending
up
with
is
dry
land
rather
than
wetland,
or
if
you
take
a
little
sludge
from
someplace
else
and
put
it
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
when
you
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
say,
well,
nonpoint
is...
that's
another
issue,
whether
this
is
a
point
source,
whether
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that's...
that's
another
issue--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--than
whether...
i
thought
you
were
saying
this
is
a
redeposit
of
the
same
material.
therefore,
it
can't
come
under
the
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
redeposit
that
could
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why...
there's
something
called
a
backhoe
that
has
been
labeled
a
point
source
and
a
bulldozer
that
has
been
labeled.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not
a
ripper?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
argument
that...
that
it's
a...
it's
not
adding
material.
no
new
material
is
added,
but
as
i
take
the
government's
argument,
it's
converting
something
that
wasn't
a
pollutant
into
a
pollutant
when
this
deep
ripper
churns
up
the
earth
and
deposits
the
rocks
and
the
soil
and
the
biological
material
on
the
top.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
that
different
from--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
propeller
that
was
involved
in
the
florida
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear,
are
you
saying
that
an...
an
ordinary
plow
too,
like
this
deep
ripper,
would
be
a
point
source,
but
what
takes
that
activity
out
is
that
it
would
come
under
the
normal
farming
exemption?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
is
a
point
source.
