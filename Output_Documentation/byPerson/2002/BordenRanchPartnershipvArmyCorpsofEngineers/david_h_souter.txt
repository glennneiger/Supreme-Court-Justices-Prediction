it's
the
conveyance
that
is
confined,
not
the
material.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
isn't
that
what
the
plain
language
says?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
says
confined
conveyance,
not
confining
conveyance.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we're
coming
up
with
it
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why...
why
will
not
up
and
down
satisfy?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
that's
not
your
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
not
your
purpose.
but
that
is
necessarily
what
you
are
doing
by
the
activity
that
you
engage
in,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's...
let's
assume
that
i...
i'm
accepting
justice
breyer's
suggestion
and
the
rake
would
be
a...
would...
would
be
a
point
source
here
because
it
conveyed.
if
that
is
so,
why
should
there
be,
in
effect,
a...
a...
an
excluding
analysis
for
the...
for
the
ripper
that
moves
the
stuff
up
and
down?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--would
give
us...
would
you
give
us
a...
your
best
comprehensive
description
of
what
this
kind
of
so-called
plowing
does?
does
it
leave
the
clay
down
at
the
clay
layer
and
simply
break
it
up?
does
some
of
the
clay
find
its
way
up
in
the
course
of
this
ripping?
i'm
not
sure
that
i
know
how
it
works.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
would
you
be
explicit
about
what
is
implicit
in
that
is,
and
that
is,
the
definition
of
wetland,
i
take
it,
is
the...
the
land
area
between
the
surface
and
the
hard
pan,
and
the
area
beneath
that
is
not
part
of
wetland
so
that
if
you
take
material
from
beneath
and
bring
it
up,
you
are
moving
into
the
wetland.
is
that
your
definition
and
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i...
i
think...
i
thought
you
were
saying
it
does
not
go
below
the
clay
level
because
i
thought
you
were
making
the
argument
that
when
you
bring
material
from
below
the
clay
level
into
the
wet
area,
you
are
moving
it
into
the
wetland
from
outside
the
wetland.
so
i
thought
you
were
making
the
further
proposition
that
the
wetland
stops
at
the...
at
the
clay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
does
primary
mean?
