day
o'connor
well,
did...
did
the
district
court
here
find
that
the
deep
ripping
tracked
material
into
wetland
areas
from
the
adjacent
uplands?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
as
to
those
three?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
difference
between
deep
ripping
and
deep
plowing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what...
what
is
the
effect
of
section
1344
which
says
nonprohibited
discharge
of
dredged
or
fill
materials,
that
the
discharge
from
normal
farming
and
activities
such
as
plowing
are
not
considered,
i
guess,
as
a--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so,
you
think
we
never
get
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
we
were
to
disagree
with
you,
because
of
this
marginal
shifting
of
soil
from
the
uplands
to
the
wetland,
then
we'd
have
to
look
at
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
be
used
for
normal
farming
and
plowing
presumably
without
a
permit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
is
a...
is
a
point
source
a
defined,
discrete
conveyance?
is
that
how
the
statute
deals
with
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
a
plow
of
this
type
such
a
conveyance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
that's
a
point
of
disagreement
between
you
and
your
opponent
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
doesn't
just
go
in
and
come
out.
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
your
view
moves
the
material?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
the
side
or
forward
or
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
easy
to
see,
a
dredge
that
takes
a
quantity
of
material
and
physically
moves
it
to
another
place.
here
your
opponent
says
this
goes
in
but
it
comes
up
and
down.
it
doesn't,
in
fact,
move
the
material
to
a
different
spot.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
congress
exempted
normal
farming
and...
and
activities
such
as
plowing,
did
it
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--from
a
permit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
say
here
there
was
a
change
in
the
use.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
your
opponent
doesn't
want
us
to
reach
that
exception
because
he
says
he
wants
to
rest
on
the
fact
that,
a,
it
wasn't
a
point
source,
that
the
plow
is
not
a
point
source,
and
b,
there
was
no
addition.
there
was
simply
a
redeposit
of
material
in
the
same
place.
have
you
dealt
with
that
yet?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
excuse
me.
i
thought
your
opponent
said
it
isn't
an
addition
because
it's
a
redeposit
of
material.
have
you
dealt
with
that?
