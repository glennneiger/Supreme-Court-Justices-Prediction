justice
david
h.
souter
on
your
first
point,
suppose
you
have
a
contract
that
is
very
clear
that
there
can
be
no
triple
damages
under
rico,
that's
right
in
the
contract,
is
it
your
position
that
that
goes
to
the
arbitrator
and
it's
for
the
arbitrator
to
say
that
this
violates
public
policy
and
i'm
going
to...
well,
i
mean,
what
would
happen
in
that
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
how...
how
clear
has
it
got
to
be
before
there
is
some
kind
of
a
tether?
let's
assume
you
had
a
simpler
case
than
this
one
in
which
the
arbitration
agreement
provided...
this
is
silly,
but
for
the
sake
of
a
point,
that
no
damages
will
be
awarded
by
the
arbitrator
for
the
violation
of
any
statutory
claim,
as
distinct
from
a
tort
claim,
common
law
tort
claim,
or
a
contract
claim.
would
you
say
that
in
that
case
there
was,
in
fact,
a
threshold
question
of
arbitrability
because
that
provision
went
so
clearly
to
the
validity
of
the
agreement
that
it
should
be
treated
as
a,
could
be
properly
treated
as
a
threshold
matter
for
a
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about
my
situation?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
in
that
case
you're...
well,
and
again,
maybe...
maybe
this
is
where
it
gets
theoretical.
in...
in
that
case,
in
effect,
you're...
you're
waiving
any
statutory
claim
at
the
beginning.
in...
in
the
case
i
gave,
maybe
it's
the
same
point,
i
just
said
you
waive
damages.
i...
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
waive...
on
that
theory
you
wouldn't
be
waiving
equitable
remedies
if
there
were
any,
so...
so
let's
just
take
my
case.
you
waive
the
damages...
you
don't
waive
the
claim.
you
waive
the
damages.
you
don't
waive
the
right
to
equitable
remedy.
is...
is
that...
is
the...
is
the...
in
effect
the...
the
waiver
of
the
right
to
damages
in
the
arbitration
agreement
sufficient
to
raise
a
serious
enough
question
about
the
enforceability
of
the
arbitration
agreement
to
qualify
that
question
as
a
gateway
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
you're
saying,
i
think
you're
saying,
and...
and
correct
me
if
i
'm
wrong,
that...
that
no
remedial
question
can
ever
rise
to
the
level
of
a...
a
potential
threat
to
the
potential...
to...
to
vindication
of
statutory
rights.
whatever
that
phrase
may
mean,
as
we
have
employed
it,
a
mere
question
of...
of
waiver
of
remedies
will
never
rise
to
that
level
and,
hence,
will
never
get
to
the
threshold
question
status,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
if
at
least
the...
the
details
of
the
agreement
that
would
raise
the
issue
to
that
level
are
specifically
pleaded
in...
in...
in...
in
the
request,
in...
in...
in
the
action
that
takes
it
into
court,
that
at
least
the...
the...
the
breadth
of
the
frustration
doctrine
would
not
stand
in
the
way
of...
of
a
court's
adjudicating
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
you're
simply
saying
they've
got
to
be
specific
in
telling
us
right
at
the
outset
what
it
is
that
makes
it
unconscionable.
they
can't
just
come
up
and
say,
oh
well,
there's
a
potential
for
frustration
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
uh-huh.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
arbitrator
in
a
case
like
this
could
not
even...
could...
let's
assume...
let's
assume
the
arbitrator
took
the
position
that
he
couldn't
award
treble
damages.
do
you
take
the
position
that
under
this
contract
the
arbitrator
could
not
award
simple
compensatory
damages?
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
why
isn't
this
premature?
i
mean,
as
justice
ginsburg
says,
suppose
he
finds
no
violation?
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
it's
not
premature.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
not
an
objection,
in
its...
in
itself,
that
goes
to
the
question
presented
here,
the
fact
that
you
think
it's
a
one-sided
contract.
i
mean,
there
are
lots
of
one-sided
contracts
that
are
enforced.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
then
want
us
to
adopt
a
specific
gateway
rule
when
any
arbitration
agreement
limits
a
statutory
remedy,
and
that
statutory
violation
would
be
arbitrable,
and
as
i
understand
it,
your
rule
is,
any
limitation
in
an
arbitration
agreement
of
statutory
remedy
raises
a
question
of
public
policy,
a
question
of
public
policy
is
a
gateway
arbitrability
question,
and
it
always
goes
to
the
court
first.
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
that
a
fair
statement--
justice
david
h.
souter
--your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's,
i
guess
you
want
to
say
for...
leaving
arbitration
out
of
it,
that
sounds
very
far-reaching,
because
i
would
have
thought
the
matter
might
have
varied,
depending
upon
the
statute.
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
congress
could
sometimes
pass
a
statute
with
remedies,
that
it
would
not
be
against
public
policy
for
two
private
persons
to
limit--
