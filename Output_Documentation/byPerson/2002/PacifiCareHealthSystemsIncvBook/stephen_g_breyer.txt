justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
arbitrator,
i
take
it,
on
the
face
of
the
contract
simply
could
not
award
the
damages,
or
are
you
saying
that
he
might?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he'd
say,
this
is
against
public
policy
and
i'm
giving
you
triple
damages?
i
don't
care
what
the
contract
says,
i
go
beyond
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
contract?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
our
best
case,
or
is
there
one,
for
the
proposition
that
if
the
contract
says
the
arbitrator
may
not
do
x,
and
x
violates
public
policy,
that
the
arbitrator
goes
ahead
and
does
it
anyway?
what's
our
case
that
says
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
i'm
not
sure
in
any
of
those
cases
it
was
clear
that
the
contract
in
very
explicit
terms
said,
you
cannot
do
this.
i...
i...
i
recognize
that
in
those
cases
it
does
say
if
there's
important
public
policy
it
can't
be
overturned
by
the
arbitration.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
it's
quite
simple.
i
don't
see
what's
so
complicated
about
this.
i
thought
what
you
were
saying,
and
i
thought
that's
what
the
law
was,
but
tell
me
if
i'm
not
right,
please,
is,
interpreting
the
contract
is
a
matter
for
the
arbitrator,
but
once
we
know
what
the
contract
means,
then
whether
that
contract,
as
interpreted,
provides
sufficient
remedy
to
be
valid
as
an
arbitration
contract
is
for
the
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
not
the
second?
i
mean,
after
all,
if
you
have
a
contract
which
says,
jones
and
smith
agree
to
arbitrate
all
damage
claims,
but
no
damages
shall
ever
be
awarded,
no
matter
what,
okay,
that's
pretty
clear
that
the
enforcement
of
that
would
invalidate
that
arbitration
agreement
because
it
can't
be
enforced.
the
person
who
should
say
that
is
the
judge,
because
the
judge
says,
look,
you
people
don't
have
an
arbitration
contract.
now,
why
you'd
leave
that
to
the
arbitrator...
i
guess
you
could,
but
i
think
that
is
a
gateway
matter
that
i
think
you'd
have
to
be
quadruple
clear
about
that
somebody
wanted
that
point
decided
by
an
arbitrator.
now,
that's
how
i'm
understanding
it,
so
i'd
like
you
to
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
part's
very
simple.
what
the
contract
means
is
for
the
arbitrator.
the
parties
have
agreed
to
that.
but
once
we
know
what
it
means,
whether
it
is
an
enforceable
arbitration
contract
or
violates
some
anti...
some
statute
that
says...
or
some
public
policy
and
the...
which
means,
you
two
cannot
arbitrate
this
kind
of
thing
with
this
kind
of
agreement,
that
question
of
arbitrability
is
for
the
judge,
because
it
is
a
gateway
matter.
if,
in
fact,
this
contract
for
arbitration
is
unlawful,
as
against
pubic
policy
or
whatever,
then
there
is
no
arbitration
contract,
and
that
matter
is
a
matter
for
the
judge,
unless
the
parties
clearly
indicate
that
they
want
it
to
be
decided
by
an
arbitrator.
and
i
read
through
those
cases
a
little
while
ago,
and
that
seemed
to
me
what
they
said,
and
so
i
wrote
it
into
an
opinion
which
i
think
every
member
of
this
court
but
one
agreed
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
say
when
you
would
decide
it.
i
said,
the
matter
is
a
matter
for
the
judge.
if
we
don't
know
what
the
contract
means,
then
i
guess
we
have
to
go
to
the
arbitrator
to
find
out
before
we
know,
before
we
can
present
the
judge.
that's
vimar,
or
vimar,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
you
probably
would
end
up
agreeing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
you'd
have
to...
the
arbitrator
would
have
to
decide
whether
implicit
in
the
terms
of
the
contract
is
a
decision
by
the
parties
that
would
permit
him
to
waive
the
thing.
i
mean,
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
will,
i
think...
i'd
like
the
answer,
anyway.
if
we
assume
in
the
contract
it
says,
and
the
parties
agree
that
this
contract
is
exclusive
in
respect
to
remedy,
and
the
arbitrator
does
not
have
the
power
to
strike
out
some
remedies
and
put
in
others,
okay,
so
now
they've
done
that,
now
i
take
it
the
answer
to
his
first
hypothetical
is,
you
go
to
the
judge,
and
the
agreement's
no
good.
isn't
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
the
contract
has
only
one
remedy.
the
remedy
is
clearly
illegal.
there
is
a
sentence
in
the
contract
saying
the
arbitrator
has
no
power
to
add
a
new
remedy
or
to
strike
the
old
one.
now
we
have
it
absolutely
clear
that
this
is
an
unlawful
arbitration
agreement,
and
the
judge
would
say
that
without
sending
it
to
arbitration,
wouldn't
he?
that's
the
same
question
i
asked
before--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
thought
your
answer
was,
of
course.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
i'm
wrong.
that's
why
i'm
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
he's
made
the
concession
right
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
he
has
five
arguments
for
saying,
any
good
lawyer
would,
that
these
words
that
you
read
punitive
damages,
extracontractual
damages,
do
not
prevent
the
arbitrator
from
awarding
treble
damages,
so
he
has
one
interpreting
the
thing,
two,
if
the
interpretation
fails
he
concedes
it,
three,
there's
nothing
in
the
contract
says
he
can't
concede
it,
and
so
why
don't
we
send
this
to
the
arbitrator
to
find
out
what
the
contract
means
before
we
decide
that
it
must
mean
something
that
would
bar
its
enforcement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
didn't
we,
the
court
hold
precisely,
do
it
after
the
fact,
in
vimar?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
precisely
the
same
circumstance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
contract
doesn't
cover
a
tort
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
what
they
wanted
to
have
is
an
arbitration
between
doctors
and
hospitals,
and
the
single
most
likely,
or
a
very,
very
likely
kind
of
dispute
they
call
tort
disputes,
aren't
even
covered
by
the
arbitration
agreement,
and
it's
impossible
for
an
arbitrator
to
come
to
a
different
conclusion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that's
your
position.
it's
just,
as
i
said
it
with
my
tone
of
voice,
i'm
suggesting
it
sounds
implausible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
i'd
like
is
an
argument
for
that
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
many
judges
who
are
lawyers
end
up
not
following
the
law.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
true
if
parties
settle
a
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
wrote
that
word,
or
whoever
wrote
it,
the
word
extracontractual,
no
extracontractual
damages,
now,
i
guess
it
could
mean
one
of
two
things.
it
could
mean
what
you
think
it
means,
which
is,
you
can't
bring
any
tort
cases,
all
you
can
bring
are
contract
cases,
you
can't
bring
any
statutory
cases
in
arbitration,
or
it
might
mean,
if
you
happen
to
have
a
contract
case,
if
that's
the
nature
of
the
case,
you
cannot
give
damages
for
mental
suffering
or
other
kinds
of
punitive
damages
in
a
contract
case.
now,
if
you
were
drafting
this,
and
you
wanted
it
to
mean
the
first,
rather
than
meaning
the
second,
why
didn't
you
just
write
the
words,
there
won't
be
a
tort
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
didn't
you
just
write
the
words,
there
won't
be
a
statutory
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
did
you
run
all
around
robin
hood's
barn
in
order
to...
whatever
they...
my...
rob...
whatever
you
say.
i
mean,
why
did
you
get
such
a
complicated
way
just
to
tell
people,
we
don't
want
tort
cases
in...
or
this
arbitration?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
you
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
it's
your
fault.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
two
parties
agree
in
advance
that
if
a
rico
violation
comes
up
they
will
only
have
double
damages,
nothing
about
arbitration,
just
in
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
cannot?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can...
can
you
do
it
in
an
antitrust
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
ever
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
two
parties
agree
in
a
tort
suit
that...
before
there's
a
tort
committed,
that
if
there
is
a
tort,
no
damages
greater
than
a
million
dollars
in
punitives
will
be
collected?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
doesn't
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
under
federal
law
you
cannot...
it's
void
against
public
policy
to
limit
in
any
way
any
possible
damages
in
a
future
lawsuit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there...
has
that
been
decided?
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--was
it
always...
in
your
view,
always,
no
matter
what
the
statute,
two
people
cannot
say
in
advance,
we
will,
if
there
should...
should
a
violation
arise,
we
will
agree
that,
in
advance,
that
the
limitation
will
not
exceed
$10
million...
or
the
damages
won't
exceed...
put
in
some
reasonable
amount?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
only
waiving,
putting
a
limitation
on
damages.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
what's
involved,
which
is
identical,
is
the
kind
of
prudential
consideration
for
courts,
don't
decide
a
difficult
issue
unless
you
have
to.
now,
in
vimar
it
just
said,
look,
we
may
never
have
to
decide
this.
send
it
to
the
arbitrator
and
see.
now
what
you've
suggested
is
to
my
mind
a
pretty
tough
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
we
may
never
have
to
decide
it,
or
at
least
not
soon.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
arbitrator
will
interpret
the
contract
to
see
if
it
really
arises.
