mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
start
with
the
principle
that
arbitrability
is
to
be
determined
by
the
court,
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
including
in
at&t
and
first
option,
and
that
there
is
no...
no
presumption,
or
no
liberal
policy
in
favor
of
giving
that
issue
of
arbitrability
to
the
arbitrator.
it's
exactly
the
opposite.
you
go
one
step
further,
since
this
case
involves
an
issue
of
public
policy,
and
in
both
w.
r.
grace,
and
later
in
misco
and
in
eastern
associated
coal
corporation,
this
court
said
that
questions
of
public
policy
are
for
the
court,
not
for
the
arbitrator.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
you
did,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
i
think
this
case
shows
that
it...
that
it's
rare,
and
i
think
the
various
amicus
briefs
that
have
been
submitted
shows
that
an
effort
to
put
limits
on
remedies,
which
this
court
has
attacked
many
times,
is
rare.
i
mean,
other
defendants
didn't
do
that
here.
the
well
point
didn't--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--this
court...
within
the
context
of
arbitration,
justice
o'connor's
question,
this
court
has
never
allowed
the
waiver
of
statutory
remedies
in
the
context
of
an
arbitration,
enforcing
an
arbitration
provision.
if
you
go
back
to
mitsubishi
and
follow
every
case
right
through
waffle
house,
this
court
over
and
over
and
over
again
has
quoted
the
portions
of
mitsubishi,
and
footnote
19
from
mitsubishi,
saying
that
you're
only
changing
the
forum
when
you're
arbitrating.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well,
the
concern
i
have
with
that,
your
honor,
is
if...
if
you
read
the
question
presented
in
his
brief,
that's
not
what
it
says.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
he
has
made
the--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--well,
the
problem
with
that...
the
problem
with
that
is,
doing
it
after
the
fact
has
some
pretty
severe
policy
implications.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--in
that
case,
your
honor,
you
were
dealing
with
the
international
context,
where
you
said,
starting
in
mitsubishi
is
a...
is
a
special
situation
concerning,
where
you've
got
to
be
concerned
with
international
law.
that's
number
one.
number
two,
especially
when
you
use
the
united
language
that
justice
o'connor
quoted,
you
couldn't
get
much
more
clear
than
united
was
in
its
provision,
no
extracontractual
damages,
including--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--it
doesn't
cover
a
tort
action.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
that
is...
that
is...
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--well,
the
argument
for
that
position
is,
you
start
with
the
language,
and
you
don't
only
start
with
the
language
that
says,
no
extracontractual
damages
and,
in
fact,
the
issue
you
get
in
arbitration,
and...
and...
and
you
go
to
arbitration,
and
i
know
we
assume
arbitrators
are
going
to
follow
the
law,
absolutely,
the
court
has
said
that
many
times,
although
many
arbitrators
are
not
lawyers,
but
i've
handled
many
arbitrations,
and--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--your
honor,
you
can
say
that,
but
i
don't
think
i
can.
[laughter]
and...
and
the
arbitrators
almost
invariably
say,
you
know,
this
is...
this
is
what
created
me,
the
contract
is
my
bible,
where
i
get
my
directions,
and
if
the
contract
says
very
plainly,
no
extracontractual
damages,
even
if
later
on
it
says,
and
follow
the
law,
and
if
it
says...
says
that
you
can't
vary
or
ignore
the
terms
of
this
agreement,
which
this
agreement
says,
that
is
a
strong
impediment
against
an
arbitrator
awarding
appropriate
relief
where
you've
got
a
federal
statute
that
creates
tort-like
damages.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well,
that's
good,
and
now
that
the
issue
has
been
specifically
raised,
and
after
the
fact,
after
it's
raised
they
come
in
and
waive
it.
the
concern
we
have
is,
what
about
the
times
when
it's
not
specifically
raised?
what
about
the
times
when
you
go
forward
through
arbitration
and
perhaps--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--well,
it's
not...
it's
this
language,
though,
your
honor.
it's
this
language.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
but...
but
your
honor,
they
didn't
come
in
and
waive
that
position
until
it
got
before
judge
moreno,
and
judge
moreno
was
going
to
hold
it
illegal,
going
to
hold
this
arbitration
agreement
unenforceable
because
of
the
overreaching
they
engaged
in
by
limiting
the
remedies
that
could
be
awarded.
it
was
only
then,
having
been
caught,
that
they
say,
okay--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--well,
they
were
never
before
an
arbitrator,
that's
true,
your
honor.
they
were
never
before
an
arbitrator,
but
that's
when
it
was
finally
waived,
after
the
issue
was
specifically
presented,
and
the
judge
was
not
going
to
enforce
it,
and
that's
when
judge
moreno
said
no,
we're
not
going
to
allow
this
after
the
fact
waiver.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well,
in
truth,
i
think
he
thought
it
should
never...
if
they're
going
to
take--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--it
means,
after
the
issue
was
presented
to
the
trial
court.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well,
but
the
problem
with
that
is,
your
honor,
it
means
that
that
provision
is
still
there.
it's
still
addressed.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well,
if
parties
settle
a
case,
that's
a
very
different
question,
because
this
is
a
prospective
provision
that
applies
out
into
the
future,
and
that's
the
difference.
the
way...
that's
the
whole
difference
about
our
argument
about
waiver
that's
presented
to
you.
of
course
people
waive
things
in
settlements
all
the
time,
but
they
don't
waive
things
prospectively,
and
this
court
hasn't
allowed
the
waiver
of
statutory
rights
prospectively.
that's
the
big
difference.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well,
that--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--that's
true,
but
if...
if...
if
a
court
or
an
arbitrator
can't
grant
the
remedies
that
congress
has
authorized
for
a
violation,
including
for
a
criminal
violation,
if
the
court
can't
grant
that
relief,
then
there
is
a
serious
public
policy
problem
with
putting
the
parties
into
that
forum
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
the
public
policy
problem
is
that...
is
that
the
arbitrator
then
cannot
remedy
it.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
under
the
plain
language
of
the
united
contract,
yes,
your
honor,
because
it
says
no
extracontractual
damages.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
take
that--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--it...
it...
it's
premature
because
it...
it
is
a...
it
is...
it
is
a
wasted
process
if
you
can
go
through
a
proceeding--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--to
go
through
the
arbitration
process,
when
you
know
in
advance
that...
that
the
arbitrator
can't
fully
remedy
the
violation--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--but
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
judge
moreno
did.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
judge
moreno
said
that
the
contract
claim
goes
to
the
arbitrator.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
but...
but
your
honor,
you
split
things
up
in
byrd.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
you
split
things
up
in
volt.
and...
and
i
mean,
that
is
not...
there
are
many
cases
where
some
cases
go
to
arbitration
and
some
cases--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--and
some
claims
stay
in
court.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
and
then
the
parties
decide,
do
they
want
to
pursue
that
issue
in
arbitration.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
actually,
it
did
not.
in
this
instance,
it
really
simplified
the
situation,
because
here
what
you're
dealing
with,
and
what
the
focus
of
the
claims
are
on,
is...
is
the
automatic
adjudication
of
claims
the
way
they...
the
way
they
adjudicate
claims
of
doctors
through
computerized
processes
that
by
computerization
automatically
down-code
a
bundle.
you're
dealing
with
claims
that
are
$5,
$10,
$15,
that
frankly
can't
be
resolved
through
an
arbitration
process
or
any
process
on
a
claim
by
claim
basis,
but
the
judge
said,
you've
got
to
go
forward
in
arbitration
on
the
breach
of
contract
claims
and,
since
those
weren't
practical
to
be
pursue
in
any
forum,
we
made
the
decision,
and
the...
and
the
doctors,
the
individual
doctors
made
the
decision
not
to
pursue
them.
those
are
over.
it
was
resolved
very
efficiently
in
the
district
court
on
whether
the
claims
should
be
arbitrated
or
not
arbitrated,
and
that
dispute
ended,
and...
and
so
it
was
done
very,
very
efficiently
in
this
instance.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--well--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
didn't
write
this.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
this
is...
this
is...
this
is
in
the
form
contract
that
united
presented
to...
to
doctors
and
medical
groups
and
had
them
sign
under
a
section
that
says,
resolution
of
disputes,
that
only
refers
to
arbitration
when
you
get
down
into
the
print.
it's
not
even...
it's
not
even
entitled
arbitration,
but...
but...
but
i
mean,
could
i
have
written
it
differently
to
say...
of
course
i
could.
but
i
mean...
i
mean,
they
wrote
it,
and...
and...
and
it's
really
our
position
that
they
wrote
it
to
discourage
doctors
from
being
able
to...
to...
to
recover
claims
in
arbitration,
and
to
limit
what
doctors
could
recover,
not
only
to
send
them
to
arbitration,
but
then
also
to
place
limits
on
what
they
could
get
once
they
got
there,
because
they
didn't
limit,
they
didn't
have
a
provision,
like
they
seem
to
say
in
their
briefs,
we
waive,
each
party
waives
punitive
damages
against
the
other,
and
then
you
would
have
to
consider
under
state
law,
can
you
do
that,
depending
on
where
you
are.
instead,
they
say--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--well,
that's
true,
but
i
think
it
has
to
be
taken
into
the
mix.
that...
that's
absolutely
right,
there...
there
are
one-sided
contracts
that
are
enforced,
and...
and
lots
of
one-sided
arbitration
contracts
that
are
enforced,
but--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--well,
here's...
here's
the
problem
with
that,
especially
if
you
read
the...
the
eleventh
circuit
rico
decisions.
the
issue
of
remedy--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--and...
and
in
cases
like
sykes,
and
i
apologize,
this
is
going
beyond
what's
in
the
briefs,
but
i'm
trying
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
and...
and
in
cases
like
sykes,
the
issue
of
damages,
either
to
the
individual
plaintiffs,
or
the
damages
to
the
class--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--are
so
wound
up
in
the
question
of
rico
violation
that
what
you're
left
with,
then,
is
trying
the
case
twice
if
you
do
it
the
way
you
suggest.
now--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg,
i
thought
i
was
answering
the
question
of...
of
what's
the
problem
with
trying
violation
first,
assuming
the
arbitrator
couldn't
award
damages,
and
then
trying
damages
later.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
that's
right,
so
if
the
arbitrator
couldn't
award
damages
in
the
first
place,
you
would
be
trying
damages
in
the
first
instance.
you
would
only
get
a
determination
of
violation,
and
then
you
would
go
back
somewhere
else,
presumably,
and
try
the
question
of
remedy,
and
you
would
retry
the
question
of
damages.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
if
the
arbitrator--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--then
that
takes
away
that
objection,
but
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
the
question
i
was
asked.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well,
it...
it...
it
could
be
what
the
arbitrator
decides.
under
our
reading
of
what
united
wrote
out
there,
and
under
our
reading
of
no
punitive
damages,
after
this
court
has
developed
the
concept
of
punitive
damages
in
gore,
so...
i
mean,
there's
almost
a
presumed
trebling
issue
there,
that
if
you
get
much
below
that,
beyond
that,
there
become
constitutional
questions.
with...
with
the
development
of
that,
then...
then
we
don't
see
there...
we
see
severe
problems,
especially
as
that
law
developed,
and
especially
as
the
tax,
your...
your...
based
on
your
tax
decisions,
saying
treble
damages
are
punitive
damages.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
no--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--what...
what
i'm
saying
is
much
more
limited
than
that,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
instances
where
someone
like
united
or
pacificare
decides
not
only
to
insist
on
an
arbitration
agreement
but
also
to
place
limits
on
what
the
remedies
are
that
the
arbitrator
can
award,
and
that's
what
they
did
here,
in
those
instances,
the
court
should
look
at
what
those
limitations
are
on
remedies
and
make
a
public
policy
determination
if
there's
a
federal
statutory
claim
out
there.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
remedy
is
different
than
procedure,
and...
and...
and...
and
as
i
read
howsam...
and
obviously,
i
mean,
you
know,
it's
a
fresh
opinion.
you
all
are
all
much
closer
to
it
than
i
am,
but
as
i
read
howsam,
it
draws
the
procedural,
substantive
distinction.
remedies
are
not
procedural
issues,
and
remedies
can
have
a
direct
impact
on
public
policy
questions,
and
so
for
that
limited
area--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--well,
you
certainly
can,
and
if
they
go
far
enough,
and
i
think
that's
what
you
were
saying
in
green
tree,
had
the
record
gone
far
enough
in
green
tree,
what
the
court...
the
court
said,
there
could
be
instances
where
the
limitations
that
are
placed
on,
procedurally
on
getting
to
arbitration
go
far
enough
that
they
void
the
arbitration
clause--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--but
the
record
there
didn't
go
far
enough.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
that...
that...
that's
true,
your
honor,
which
i
assume,
and
courts
below
i
think
are
now,
there
are
situations
where
records
are
being
developed
further
to
determine,
so
that
the
trial
courts
can
make
that
determination,
has
the
remedy,
has
the
arbitration
process
been
so
impeded
by
those
procedural
issues
that
you
can't
enforce
it.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
no.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
no.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
in...
in
our
judgment,
your
honor,
you...
you
cannot
do
it.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
it
depends
on
the
state
law.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
that's
a
state
law
question.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
your
honor,
in
mc--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--in
mcmahon
you
said
that...
that
parties
cannot
waive
securities,
future
securities
violations
even
if
there
was
a
deal
so
that
you
got
a
lower...
a
lower
payment
for
the
transaction.
in
barrentine
you
said,
either
parties
or
unions
can't
respectively
waive
fair
labor
standards
act
violations
in
the
future.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
i--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--it
went
to
remedy,
and
what
you've
got,
your
honor,
i
think
is,
congress
has
established
what
that
remedy
is,
and
i
think
it
would
be
void
as
against
public
policy.
i
mean--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
for
that--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--for
that
limited
issue
of,
did
the...
did
the
limitation,
is
there
a
limitation
on
the
remedy
authorized
by
congress.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
your
honor,
congress--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--i
suppose
in
theory
congress
could
say,
in
the
act,
parties
can
waive
this
respectively.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
congress...
congress
has
not
done
that,
and
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
our
position.
if
congress
establishes
a
remedy
for
a
violation,
and
i
think
this
is
discussed
in
much
more
detail
in
the
public
citizen
amicus
brief
that's
submitted
than
it
was
in
our
briefs,
because
we
were
trying
to
address
the
specific--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--arbitration
issues
and
limitations
within
arbitration,
which
is
the
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
and...
and
the
court
said,
it's
not
clear
here
whether
that's
going
to
be
followed
or
not
followed.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
i
think
you
said,
it
is
not
clear
to
us
whether
that
will
be
followed
or
not
followed
in
this
instance,
and
that's--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--that's
why
you
allowed
it
to
proceed.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well,
except
that
there's
no...
i
don't
read
that.
there
are
two
issues--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--i
don't
read
that
as
saying
specifically
that
that
act
would
not
be
followed,
number
one,
their
contract.
number
two,
there
is
the
separate
consideration
there,
as
in
mitsubishi,
of
the
concerns
about
international,
of
international
relations,
where
you
have
said
you've
got
to
be
especially
hands
off,
and
that
issue
is
not
involved
here.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--well,
you
might
not.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
you
might
not,
but
it's
not
just,
it's
a
tough
issue,
send
it
to
the
arbitrator
and
let
the
arbitrator
decide.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
but
number
2,
it's
also
in
an
international
setting,
where
we've
got
to
be,
be,
you
know,
be
concerned
about
that
and
grant
all
possible
deference
to
that
situation.
if
there
are
not
other
questions--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--your
honor,
that
gets
back
to
the
problem
that
i
was
addressing
before.
the
claims
here
on
a
claim
by
claim
basis
are
so
small
that
you
cannot
take
them
to
arbitration.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well,
it's
not
abandoning
the
case,
your
honor,
because
there
is
a
separate
conspiracy
and
aiding
and
abetting
claim
that
is
going
forward
that
is
not
up
before
this
court.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
and
the
claim
here,
if
we
have
to...
have
to
resolve
those,
even
the
rico
claims,
even
if
you
treble
$5
to
get
$15,
if
we
have
to
try
those
on
a
claim
by
claim
basis,
in
terms
of
what
the
doctors'
damages
are,
it
can't
be
done,
and
we
will
not
proceed.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
well,
because...
and...
and...
and
i
know
you're
going
to
address
this
issue
in
basil
to
some
extent,
but
the
issue
in
court,
the
issues
have
been
certified
in
the
court,
so
they're
proceeding
as
a
class
action,
which
is
the
only
way
that...
that
claims
of
this
magnitude
can
be
handled,
and
so
that's
our
problem.
if
we
could
proceed
in
arbitration
on
a
class-wide
basis,
sure
we
would
do
it,
and...
and
doing
that
in
the
federal
system
has
limits
thus
far,
but...
but
proceeding
on
a
claim
by
claim
basis,
where
the
damages
are
$5,
$10,
$15,
$50
for
the
bundling
down
claim--
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
yes.
the
trial
court
has
certified
the
claims
that...
that...
that
are...
that
are...
that...
that...
that...
that
were
not
referred
to
arbitration.
the...
that
currently
is
on
appeal,
on
a
23(f)
appeal
to
the
eleventh
circuit.
we've
moving
forward
with
discovery
on
those
claims
that
are
certified.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it's
nationwide.
mr.
joe
r.
whatley,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honors.
