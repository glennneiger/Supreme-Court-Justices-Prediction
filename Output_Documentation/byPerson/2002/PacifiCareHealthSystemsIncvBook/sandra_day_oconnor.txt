well,
but
in
one
of
the
arbitration
clauses,
i
think,
it
says
the
arbitrator
shall
not
vary
or
ignore
the
terms
of
this
agreement,
shall
have
no
authority
to
award
extracontractual
damages
at
any
time,
including
punitive
or
exemplary
damages.
now,
what's
the
arbitrator
to
do
with
a
provision
like
that?
is
that
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
courts
have
looked
at
and
determined
whether
that's
a
valid
public
policy
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
we
ever
allowed
a
prospective
waiver
of
a
statutory
right--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
arbitration
context?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
say
that
this
provision
in
one
of
the
arbitration
clauses
that
the
arbitrator
shall
have
no
authority
to
award
extracontractual
damages
of
any
kind
is
not
clear
enough
for
a
judge
to
determine
whether
that's--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--against
public
policy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
every
one
of
these
contracts
says
the
arbitrator
will
follow
the
law,
the
arbitrator
has
no
power
to
commit
errors
of
law.
mr.
grauer,
i
think,
said
that
those
provisions
may
be
intention,
but
when
they
are,
the
one
that
controls
is
the
one
that
says
the
arbitrator
must
follow
the
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
not
clear
on
what
you
lose
at
the
end
of
the
day
if
you
let
the
arbitrator
decide
whether
there
was
a
rico
violation,
and
if
there
is
such
a
violation,
then
you
reach
the
remedy
issue,
and
if
the
arbitrator
were
somehow
to
take
the
position
that
treble
damages
were
not
available,
i
assume
that
could
then
be
resolved
in
court,
could
it
not?
i
mean,
what
do
you
lose
at
the
end
of
the
day?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
