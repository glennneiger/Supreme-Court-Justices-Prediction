mr.
william
e.
grauer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
three
reasons,
the
important
federal
policy
favoring
arbitration
would
be
seriously
undermined
if
courts
become
entangled
in
speculative
litigation
over
arbitration
remedies.
first,
the
enforceability
of
a
limitation
on
remedies
in
arbitration
ought
to
be
decided
in
the
first
instance
by
the
arbitrator,
since
that's
not
a
gateway
issue
of
arbitrability.
second,
it's
unlikely
in
this
case
that
the
arbitrator
would
have
found
that
the
limitations
on
remedies
agreed
by
the
parties
would
have
precluded
the
award
of
rico
treble
damages,
and
third,
there
is
simply
no
reason
why
parties
found
by
the
district
court
to
be
sophisticated
cannot
mutually
agree
to
limit
remedies.
turning,
then,
to--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--yes.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
yes.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
yes,
we
believe
that
it's
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide.
we
believe
that
there's
essentially
a
40-year
tradition
of
allowing
arbitrators
to
make
decisions
of
that
nature
and
of
allowing
issues
of
the
remedies
that
can
arise
in
arbitration
to
be
decided
by
the
arbitrator.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
yes.
the
arbitrator--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--well,
the
arbitrator
is
bound
first
and
foremost,
under
both
the
law
and
under
the
arbitration
clauses
in
this
case,
to
comply
with
the
controlling
law.
this
court
has
held
several
times,
in
mitsubishi,
in
vimar,
in
gilmer,
and
in
other
cases
that
we
should
not
suppose
that
the
arbitrator
will
not
follow
the
law.
we
should
assume
that
the
arbitrator
will
follow
the
law
and,
therefore,
if
the
law
requires
the
award
of
treble
damages,
even
if
the
parties
have
agreed
otherwise,
the
arbitrator
is
bound
to
follow
that
law.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
i
believe
that
that
would
be
found
in
mitsubishi,
in
the
vimar
y
seguros
case
at
page
541,
in
the
mcmahon
case
at
page--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--i
think
the...
one
example...
there
are
several
examples,
but
one
that
comes
to
mind
is
that
in
the
vimar
case
the
cogsa
prevented
the
arbitrator
from...
the
cogsa
prevented
any
reduction
in
liability
in
a
bill
of
lading,
and...
and
there
was
a
concern
that
the
law
in
japan
which
had
been
selected
to
conduct
the
arbitration
had
a
different
set
of
rules
that
could
have
allowed
the
stevedores
to
be...
to
have
liability
laid
off
on
the
stevedores,
and
yet
the
court
said,
we
will
not
indulge
in
the
presumption
that
the
arbitrator
will
not
follow
the
appropriate
law
and,
therefore,
even
though
japanese
law
was
different,
the
arbitrator,
we
assumed,
would
follow
the
controlling
law.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
it's...
it's
not
only
true
that
the...
that
the
court
has
held
several
times
that
we
should
not
assume
that
an
arbitrator
will
fail
to
follow
the
controlling
law,
but
all
of
the
arbitration
agreements,
and
i
would
cite
the
court
to
the
joint
appendix,
pages
84,
147,
168,
and
212,
in
each
of
the
arbitration
agreements
in
this
case,
the
arbitrator
is
admonished
to
follow
the
controlling
law.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
i
wouldn't
agree
with
the
court
looking
at
that,
and
here's
why.
i
agree
that
what
you
read,
justice
o'connor,
is,
in
fact,
what's
in
that
agreement,
but
if
you
read
on
in
that
sentence
it
says,
and
the
arbitrator
shall
follow
the
controlling
law.
at
best,
there
is
a
conflict
or
a
tension
between
those
terms,
and
this
is
what
arbitrators
do
all
the
time.
there
are
all
these
agreements
that
are...
that
every
day
are
presented
to
arbitrators
that
have
a
number
of
provisions
that
could
step
on
each
other,
and...
and
the
arbitrator
has
to
interpret
the
contract.
that's
what
we
bargained
for
in
entering
an
arbitration
agreement,
that
if
there
was
some
tension,
or
some
confusion
or
dispute,
that
the
arbitr--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--prospective--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--the
prospective
waivers...
yes,
i
believe
that
that,
for
example,
in
our
brief
we
cited
a
number
of
cases
such
as
mezzanatto
that
create
a
presumption
that
a
statutory
right
is
waivable
unless
congress
has
said
otherwise.
now,
in
the
arbitration
context,
again,
to
get
back
to
the
vimar
y
seguros
case,
the
party
was
agreeing
to
arbitration
even
though
there
was
a
concern
before
the
arbitration
that
the
arbitrator
might
not
follow
the
correct
law.
the
guiding
principle
of...
that...
that
has
guided
this
court's
jurisprudence
for...
for
years,
and
it's
been
reiterated
in
mitsubishi,
and
mcmahon,
and...
and
vimar,
and
gilmer,
is
that
we
should
assume
that
the
arbitrator
will
apply...
will
apply
the
correct
law,
but
if--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--absolutely.
i
agree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
two
reasons,
not
only
because
we've
made
that
concession,
but
also
because
we
agreed
to
arbitrate.
that
means
we
agreed
to
submit
any
issues
to
the
arbitrator
and
therefore,
even
if
we
had
not
made
that
concession,
we
would
believe
that
the
arbitrator
ought
to
be
asked
in
the
first
instance
to
decide
the
validity
of
a
waiver.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
to
the
extent...
yes,
i
think
it
could,
and
here's
why.
the
one
thing
that
this
court
has
said,
no
fewer
than
four
times,
and...
and
has
emphasized
i
think
those
four
times,
is
that
when
a
statutory
claim
is
arbitrated,
there...
the...
we
assume
that
post
arbitration
review
is
sufficient
to
ensure
the
vindication
of
statutory
interests,
and
the
court
mentioned
that
not
only
in
mcmahon
at
page
232,
in
gilmer
at
footnote
4,
and
also
in
vimar
and
in
mitsubishi.
in
all
four
of
those
cases,
this
court
has
specific...
excuse
me...
this
court
has
specifically
said
that...
that,
while
limited,
post
arbitration
review
is
sufficient
to
ensure
that
statutory
interests
are
vindicated.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
i
would...
i
would
agree
with
the
first
part
of
that,
justice
breyer,
and
that
is--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--i'm
not
sure
i
followed
the
first
part
of
the
hypothetical.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
justice
breyer,
i
agree
with
the
first
part,
and
that
is
this,
that
the
gateway
issue
of
arbitrability
involves
the
determination
of,
did
the
parties
make
a
valid
agreement
to
arbitrate
and,
if
they
did,
is
the
dispute
within
the
scope
of
that
agreement,
but
that
should
end,
in
our
view,
the
inquiry,
because
if
you
don't
end
the
inquiry
at
that
point,
you're...
you're
opening
the
door
to
questions
about
remedies
and
legal
issues
and
what
are
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
and
what
have
the
parties
agreed
to,
and
let
me
give
you
an
example.
the
parties...
i
sell
you
10,000
widgets
for
a
dollar
each,
as
is,
and
no...
and
liquidated
damages
of
$1
and
no
other
liability,
and
we
agree
to
that,
okay.
now,
the
person
then
sues
for
rico
because
they
want
to
get
around
that.
well,
the
only
issue
ought
to
be,
did
the
parties
make
a
valid
agreement
to
arbitrate
and,
if
so,
is
the
dispute
in
the
scope
of
that
agreement,
and
the
fact
that
there
may
be
a
downstream
dispute
about
the
validity
of
the
remedies
and
the
validity
of
the
waiver
of
the
remedies
should
not,
under
any
circumstances,
spill
over
into
the
gateway--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--vimar
y
seguros,
and
i
agree,
justice
breyer,
that
post
arbitration--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--well,
post,
as
long
as
the
agreement
is
that
it's
post
arbitration.
the
post
arbitration
review
has
been
held
four
times
by
the
court
to
be
sufficient
to
clean
up
matters
at
the
margin
that
could
come
up.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
if
the
con--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--well,
the
courts...
i
would
disagree
with
approaching
it
that
way,
because
unfortunately
what's
clear
to
a
plaintiff's
lawyer
is
often
not
clear
to
a
defense
lawyer,
and
there
are
many
elements
of
a
cause
of
action,
there
are
many
remedial
limitations--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--my
good
friend,
mr.
whatley
and
i
agree
on
very
little
in
the
case,
and
that's
the
problem.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
we
feel
that...
we--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--yes,
i
do,
and
here's
why.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
because
we
believe
that
we
bargained
to
have
an
arbitrator
make
that
decision,
and
there
are
many
words
in
this
case
that
may
seem
like
it's
clear
what
they
mean,
but
may
in
some
contexts
not
be
so
clear.
the
word
racketeering
is
used
to
describe
a
case
where
a
doctor
is
seeking
to
be
paid
more
for
treating
a
patient.
there
are
a
lot
of
words
in
this
case,
and
we
feel
that
we
bargained
to
have
an
arbitrator
interpret
them,
and
as
i
indicated
to
justice
ginsburg,
it
was
conceded
some
time
ago
that
the
term,
extracontractual
was
not
in...
was
intended
to
be
noneconomic
damages
and
was
not
intended
to
be
primarily
remedial
rico
treble
damages,
but--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--i
agree,
mr.
chief
justice.
i...
i
believe
that
the
importance
of
the
court's
recent
pronouncement
in
howsam
about
gateway
arbitrability
as
we
read
that
case
is
that
you
determine,
did
the
parties
intend
to
subject
themselves
to
the
power
of
an
arbitrator?
did
they
make
an
arbitration
agreement,
and
is
the
dispute
within
the
scope
of
that
agreement,
and
if
the
answers
to
those
questions
are
yes,
the
only
additional
issue
that
comes
up,
and
the
one
that
unfortunately
became
conflated
in
the
eleventh
circuit
below,
is
where
there
is
a
statutory
claim,
there
is
an
additional
analysis
that
this
court
has
traditionally
done,
and
that
is,
did
congress,
by
enacting
that
statute,
intend
to
override
or
preempt
the
federal
arbitration
act,
and
that's
the
issue
that
has
come
up,
and
unfortunately
what's
happened
in
the
eleventh
and
the
ninth
circuits
is
that
they
have
taken
that
concept
of
simply
making
a
determination
of
whether
another
statute
is...
preempts
the
federal
arbitration
act,
and
they've
used
it
to
create
essentially
a
floating
analysis
of
effective
vindication
that's
untethered
to
the
statutory
conflict
analysis.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
it
would
depend,
justice
souter.
i
believe
that
there
could
be
a
situation
where
an
agreement--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--in...
in...
in
your
situation,
the
reason
i
say
your
situation
would
depend
is
that
there
are
many
contracts
where
that
would
be
a
perfectly
legitimate
understanding.
for
example,
i...
i'll
sell
you
10,000
widgets,
$1
each,
i
haven't
checked
them
over,
they
may
be
no
darned
good,
but
do
you
want
them
for
$1
each,
and
i
don't
want
to
be
sued
for
this,
so
i
want
liquidated
damages
of
$1.
that
type
of
commercial
arrangement--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--i
believe
the
answer
is
no,
with
one
exception.
in
general,
anything
relating
to
remedies
should
be
dealt
with
by
the
arbitrator,
and
we
should
assume
that...
that
if
there
is
something
improper
about
that
remedial
limitation,
that
the
arbitrator
will...
will
do
what
he
or
she
is
supposed
to
do,
follow
the
law,
get
it
right.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
as
a
general
premise,
i
believe
that's
correct.
i
think
we
could
envision
situations
where
a
variety
of
factors,
including
that,
are
linked
together
such
that
the
plaintiff
might
make
a
motion
to
revoke
the
arbitration
agreement
itself
on
the,
on
traditional
contract
grounds
should
there
be
a
whole
series
of
things
that
make
a
contract
unconscionable
or
onerous,
but
that
did
not
occur
in
this
case.
in
fact,
the
court
found
that
it
was
not
unconscionable
or
onerous.
it
was
negotiated
between
sophisticated
parties,
and
so
the
court
declined
to
do
section
2
revocation
of
the
contract
for
generally
applicable
contract
grounds,
but
there
could
be
a
case
where
a
remedial
limitation,
combined
with
other
factors,
could
rise
to
that
level,
not...
certainly
not
this
case.
the
problem--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--well,
that's
correct.
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
i...
i...
i
believe
in
arbitration
cases
there's
frequently
a
motion
by
a
plaintiff
to
revoke
the
arbitration
agreement
on
grounds
of
unconscionability--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--and
judges
deal
with
those
from
time
to
time.
this
is
certainly
not
such
a
case.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
right,
and...
and
it's
very
important
to
note
an
additional
distinction,
and
that
is,
the...
the
attack
on
unconscionability
cannot
be
on
the
contract
as
a
whole,
because
if
it
is,
under
prima
paint
that,
too,
should
be
decided
by
the
arbitrator.
the
only
unconscionability,
the
only
type
of
attack
that
could
be
made
would
be
on
the
arbitration
clause
itself.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
in
this
case,
because
there's
a
federal
claim,
and
the
case
is
in
federal
court,
the
court
has
said
a
number
of
times
that
there
is
a
federal
substantive
law
of
arbitrability,
but
the
contract
itself
was
entered
between
people
governed
by
state
law,
and
so
the
revocability
question
would
be
a
decision
about
whether
that
contract
either
as
a
whole,
or
the
arbitration
clause
itself,
are
revocable
under
the
applicable
state
law
subject
to
the
overlay,
so
to
speak,
that's
created
by
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
not
allowing
states
to
have
unconscionability
laws
that
would--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--vitiate
an
arbitration
clause.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
i
don't
believe
either
of
those
would
be
the
case.
i
believe
that
if...
if
the...
you
would
arbitrate
the
issue,
and
you
would
expect
the
arbitrator
to
follow
the
law.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
there's
only...
i...
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
there
would
be
one
way
that
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
could
raise
that
issue,
which
is
not
one
of
the...
what
occurred
in
this
case,
but
i
suppose
you
could
argue
that
the
entire
arbitration
agreement
is
illusory
and
unconscionable,
but--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--i
believe
in
that
case,
as
in
the
prior
one,
you
should
send
the
matter
to
arbitration,
you
should
assume
that
the
arbitrator
will
correctly
apply
the
law,
that
if
there
is
a
provision
in
the
contract
that's
unlawful,
that
the
arbitrator
will
disregard
it.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
no.
i
don't
agree,
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
and
the
reason--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--right.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
well--
mr.
william
e.
grauer
--if...
if
there
is
a
ground
under
section
2
to
revoke
the
arbitration
clause
for
generally
applicable
grounds,
not
because
it's
an
arbitration
clause,
then
a
party
could
make
a
motion
of
that
nature
and
the
court,
of
course,
would
have
to
address
that
motion,
and...
but...
but
i
didn't
want
to
get
away
from
the
fact
that
i
think
is
important,
is
that
when
you're
dealing
with
remedies,
and
when
you're
dealing
with
arbitrators,
we
really
need
to
assume
that
the
arbitrator
will
follow
the
law.
and...
and
in
this
particular
case,
for
example,
the
arbitration
clause
does
contain
a
limitation
on
remedies,
but
that
limitation
on
remedies
could
have
been
put
elsewhere
in
the
contract,
and
if
it
were
somewhere
else
in
the
contract,
or
it
might
have
been...
the
parties
might
not
have
agreed
to
arbitrate.
they
might
have
agreed
that
we'll
litigate
in
florida,
but
the
court
will
not
have
the
power
to
award
punitive
damages.
now,
you
would
not
say
that
the
limitation
on
punitive
damages
prevents
the
parties
from
having
to
go
to
florida,
and
you
need
to
treat
an
arbitration
clause,
we
think,
the
same,
or
the
parties
might
have
had
the
remedial
limitation
in
this
case,
and
no
arbitration
clause.
now,
what
would
a
court
do?
it
would...
the
court
would
evaluate
the
validity
of
the
remedial
limitation
and
make
a
decision.
well,
an
arbitrator
is
exactly
the
same.
it's
simply
selecting
a
different
forum.
i
see
my
light's
on.
unless
there's
an
additional
question,
i
would
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
e.
grauer
mr.
whatley's
argument
about
$5
here
and
$10
there
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
what
the
district
judge
found,
and
you
can
note
at
page
a25
of
our
cert
petition
that
the
court
found
that
these
cases
were
negotiated
by
sophisticated
groups
of
doctors,
that
the
claims
were
not
small,
that
in
fact
the
doctors
were
enlarging
an
ongoing
pattern...
that's
about
midway
through
page
a25
of
our
cert
petition,
that
that
is
an
ongoing
pattern
of
instances.
mr.
whatley's
comment
about
the...
the
conspiracy
claim
has
been
certified
and
is
going
forward
is
exactly
an
example
of
the
problem.
conspiracy
is
simply
a
remedy
that's...
that...
a
way
of
creating
liability
for
an
underlying
cause
of
action,
and
the
arbitration
clauses
in
this
case
require
the
doctors
to
arbitrate
all
of
their
disputes
with
the
managed
care
companies,
and
they're
trying
to
circumvent
that
on
a
mass
basis
both
in
this
appeal
and
by
trying
to
say
that
the
conspiracy
claims
are
not
part
of
the
arbitration
clause,
and
we
don't
think
that's
appropriate,
and
we
think
when
we
talk
about
remedies
in
our
cert
petition,
that
would
include
methods
of
holding
someone
liable
for
a
claim,
and
the
court
ought
to
take
a
look
at
that
in
the
record
of
the
case.
but
i
would
agree
fundamentally
with
a
point
that
i...
i
thought
i
heard
justice
souter
making
a
moment
ago,
and
that
is
that
if
mr.
whatley's
premise
that
any
remedial
limitation
becomes
a
gateway
issue
of
arbitrability,
we
are
throwing...
we
are
overruling
howsam
after
only
a
few
weeks,
because
the
whole
point
of
howsam
was,
you
look
to
whether
the
parties
made
an
agreement
to
arbitrate,
and
you
look
to
whether
the
dispute
is
in
the
scope
of
the
agreement.
and
here,
at
page
a40
of
our
petition,
the
court
finds
this
is
an
exceptionally
broad
arbitration
agreement.
it
includes
any
and
all
controversies,
and
the
court
found
that.
that
has
never
been
appealed.
every...
all
of
the
claims
are
within
the
scope
of
it,
and
it
is
complete
speculation
to
suggest
that
that,
that
any
of
these
claims
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
agreement.
the...
the...
with
re...
a
final
point
with
reference
to
the
intent
of
the
parties.
the
parties
would
intend
an
arbitrator
to
decide
remedial
limitations,
and
the
reason
why
the
parties
would
intend
the
arbitrator
to
decide
that
is
because
the
parties
have
agreed
to
arbitrate.
they
have
a
dispute
in
the
scope.
they
would
never
intend
to
go
to
court
at
all.
they
would
intend
to
go
to
arbitration
and
comply
with
their
agreement,
and
the
question
of
remedies
would
be
the
last
thing
that
would
come
up
in
the
event,
on
a
speculative
basis,
that
they
prevail,
and
they
ought
not
to
be
able
to
get
away
from
that
basic
principle
by
labels,
the
label
of
punitive
damages,
the
label
of
rico,
the
label
of
conspiracy.
those
labels
are
being
used
to
take
away
the
rights
of
managed
care
companies
on
a
wholesale,
nationwide
basis
to
have
these
types
of
disputes
resolved
by
arbitrators,
as
the
parties
have
agreed,
and
instead
they're
trying
to
turn
it
into
a
nationwide
class
action.
