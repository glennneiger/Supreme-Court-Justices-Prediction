argument
now
in

02-215,
pacific
health
care
systems
v.
jeffrey
book.
mr.
grauer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
you're
arguing
for
basically
is
that
it
should
go
to
the
arbitrator
for
a
decision
of
almost
everything
except
what
we
have
held
to
be
gateway
issues,
and
that
if
it
doesn't,
it's
just
going
to
kind
of
get
bounced
back
and
forth
like
a
ping
pong
ball.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--under
what
law
is
unconscionability
decided?
is...
is
it
state
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
vitiate--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--may
i
ask,
i
just
want
to...
i
may
be
missing
what's
perfectly
obvious,
but
if
you
have
a
contract
in
which
the
only
remedy
authorized
to
be
provided
is
an
illegal
remedy
for
some
reason
that
could
not
be
taken
away
from
the
plaintiff,
does
the
arbitrator...
is
that
agreement
immediately
nonarbitrable,
or
do
you
arbitrate
the
issues
and
then
saying
that
there's
no
remedy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
grauer.
mr.
whatley,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
also
said
that
that
kind
of
question
that
would
affect
an
arbitration
is
fairly
rare,
didn't
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say...
you
say
this
court
has
attacked
what
many
times?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
litigate
this
language.
you're
litigating
a
particular
case
before
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
maybe
the
arbitrator
will
run...
reach
a
conclusion
that
is
consistent
with
the
contract,
say
simple
contract
damages,
and
then
it
is
not
a
waste
of
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
and
we
didn't...
we
did
not
express
a
view
as
to
what
the
situation
would
be
if
the
record
had
been
different.
we
simply
said,
conceivably
it
might.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
whatley.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
grauer,
you
have
3
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
grauer.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist

opinion
of
the
court

no.
