justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
contract
is
completely
cleared
at
the
outset,
why
not
pre-arbitration
review?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
march
up
the
hill
and
then
march
down
again?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
saying
that
nothing
is
ever
clear
to
the
bar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if,
on
the
face
of
the
contract,
a
judge
could
say,
the
only
remedy
offered
to
a
successful
complainant
is
one
that
may
not
be
submitted
to
arbitration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
waiver
of
a
statutory
right
of
some
kind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
if
that's
true,
what
if
you
have
a
case
in
which
there
are
two
remedies
available,
one
of
which
is
clearly
impermissible
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
the
other
of
which
is
permissible,
but
there's
no
severability
clause
in
the
contract?
what
do
you
do
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
the
fact...
when
did
he
think
it
should
have
been
waived
in
order
to...
to
assist
the
petitioner
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
if
he
thought
it
should
never
be,
then
what
does
after
the
fact
mean?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that
happens
all
the
time.
an
issue
is
presented
to
the
trial
court,
and
you
say,
well,
on
second
thought
i'm
not
going
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
absolutely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
just
what
is
that
public
policy
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
take
the
position
that
he
couldn't
even
determine
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
so
then
you're
splitting
the
thing
up.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
what
you're
saying
is,
one
issue
goes
to
arbitration,
the
other
one
doesn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
just
really
complicates
the
procedure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
you're
opening
up...
you're
really
expanding
the
gateway
concept.
in
other
words,
you're
no
longer
talking
about,
did
the
parties
agree
to
submit
this
to
arbitration.
you're
talking
about
remedial
terms.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
of
course,
you
can
say
procedural
issues
will
have
an
impact
on
public
policy
issues,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that's...
i
think
vimar
cuts
the
other
way,
so
the
cogsa...
cogsa
was
certainly
a
statute
enacted
by
congress.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
your
view
was
correct,
that
whole
issue
should
have
gone
to
a
judge
beforehand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
what?
