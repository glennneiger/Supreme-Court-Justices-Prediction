justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
grauer,
on
the
second
point
that
you
made,
you
said
it's
unlikely
that
the
arbitrators
would
find
that
treble
damages
are
inconsistent
with
the...
with
the
contract.
would
you,
supposing
this
case
were
to
be
before
the
arbitrator,
would
you
concede
that
the
contracts
in
question
permit
treble
damages
awards
on
a
rico
claim?
would
you
make
that
contention?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thank
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
grauer,
on
the
question
of
waiver,
you
have
represented,
and
i
want
to
make
this
clear,
that
waiver
would
be
academic
in
this
situation,
since
you
say
you
will
concede
that
all
of
these
contracts
allow
the
arbitrator
to
award
treble
damages.
is...
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
waiver
would
be
academic
because
you're
not
going
to
make
the
argument
of
waiver,
you're
going
to
make...
you're
going
to
concede
that
treble
damages
are
available
if
a
rico
violation
is
found?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
suppose
the
arbitrator
gets
it
wrong.
suppose
the
arbitrator
thinks
that
the
provision,
no
punitive
damages,
excludes
treble
damages,
and
that
that
prevails.
could
that
be
corrected
by
post
award
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
whatley,
mr.
grauer
has
conceded
that
there
is
no
waiver
here,
that
treble
damages
are
available,
so
why
are
we
engaging
in
this
academic
exercise?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
another
case.
we're
deciding
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
whatley,
they
were
never
before
an
arbitrator,
were
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
big
question
for
arbitration
is,
was
there
a
violation
of
rico,
and
i
think
one
of
the
questions
from
the
bench
suggested
that
the
scope
of
remedy
doesn't
rise
to
the
same
level
as,
is
there
a
violation
of
the
act,
and
if
in
this
case
the
arbitrator
should
find
that
if
there
is
no
violation
of
rico
on
the
part
of
care
organizations,
then
there
would
never
be
any
issue
of
remedy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and,
but
you
want
to
take
that
issue,
which
the
parties
did
agree
to
arbitrate,
and
put
that
in
the
courts,
because
you
say
there's
something
defective
in
the
remedy
provision
of
the
arbitration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
that.
if
the
damages
initially
are
compensatory,
i
mean,
the
difference
between
punitive
damages
and
these
treble
damages
is,
you
get
a
number
that's
compensatory,
and
then
you
multiply
it
by
three.
it's
not,
you
send
it
to
the
jury
and
the
sky's
the
limit,
so
i
don't
understand
your
answer
about
it
being
bound
up
with
anything...
it's...
it's
an
ordinary
measure
of
compensatory
damages
that
the
judge,
the
arbitrator
or
the
judge,
whichever
forum
you're
in,
triples.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
you
were
answering
that
question,
but
you're
saying
the
reason
you
can't
try,
was
there
a
rico
violation
first,
is
that
the
remedy
is
inextricably
bound
up
with--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
answer
to
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
we've
also
said
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
question
didn't
go
to
waiving
the
violations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
went
only
to
the
remedy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
have
one
question,
and
it's
about
something
that
the
petitioner
represented
in
the
petitioners'
brief
at
note
12,
page
23.
the
petitioner
represented
to
us
that
you
represented
to
this
court
that
if
any
issue
is
sent
to
arbitration
you
simply
will
give
up
the
claim,
that
you
will
not
arbitrate
any
issue
in
this
case.
do
you
still
take
that
position,
that...
is
this
representation
correct,
that
you
have
disclaimed
any
intention
to
arbitrate
any
claim
sent
to
arbitration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
the
rico
claim.
if
you
lose
on
where
that
goes
first,
if
it
goes
to
arbitration
first,
are
you...
are
you
saying
that
you
will
not...
that
you
will
abandon
the
case
anyway?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
mean
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
why
would
the
trial
be
different
in
court
versus
arbitration
on
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
you
gotten
a
certification
of
anything
in
the
district
court?
did
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
did?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
broad
is
it?
is
it
nationwide?
