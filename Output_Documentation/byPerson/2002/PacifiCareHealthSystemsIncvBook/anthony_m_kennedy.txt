justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're...
you're...
you're
doing
is,
you're
saying
that
it's
necessary
for
us
to
declare
the...
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
in
court
before
the
arbitration
proceeds.
that's
what
the
argument
amounts
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
think
that's
inconsistent
with
the
whole
idea
of
the
efficiencies
to
be
obtained
by
the
arbitral
process.
