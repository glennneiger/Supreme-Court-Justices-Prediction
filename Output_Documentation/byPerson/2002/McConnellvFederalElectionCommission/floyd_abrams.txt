mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
turn
from
title
i
to
title
ii,
we
turn
to
efforts
by
congress
to
limit,
to
regulate,
and
ultimately
to
punish
what
are
only
expenditures,
expenditures
not
made
in
coordination
with
parties
or
candidates
which
would
result
in
them
being
treated
as
contributions,
but
independently,
and
so
we
deal
here
this
afternoon
in
an
area
which
as
this
court
observed
in
colorado
ii,
it
has
routinely
struck
down
expend...
any
limitations
in
this
area.
we
are
all
agreed
here
that
strict
scrutiny
applies.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that,
and
i
think
we're
all
agreed
that
this
is
a
content-based
restriction
on
speech,
whether
we're
agreed
or
not,
it
is
a
content-based
restriction
on
speech.
i'd
like
to
start
with
just
a
few
observations
of--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
take
the
position
that
electionary
communications
as
defined
in
the
statute
is
so
overbroad
that
the
totality
of
what
is
encompassed
in
it
is
not
regulatable.
electionary
communications
includes
within
it
express
advocacy,
what
is
now
or
what
had
been
subject
to
regulation,
and
to
that
extent,
it
is
subject
to
regulation.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
thought
very
hard
about
that,
justice
souter,
to
see
if
there
was
something
i
could
give
you
in
that
respect.
no,
i
do
not
concede
that
there
is
anything
beyond
express
advocacy.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
understand
that
that
happens.
i
understand
what
this
court
in
buckley
understood
just
as
well,
when
it
said
almost
the
same
thing.
the
buckley
court
did
not
say
that
express
advocacy
was
going
to
catch
most,
not
to
say
all--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--but
buckley
court
was
prescient
in
understanding
that
what
has
happened
was
going
to
happen.
that
is
to
say
that
what,
what
express
advocacy
covers
would
not
be
enough
to
cover
the
range
of
conceptions,
people,
and
organizations
and
unions
and
corporations
and
others
could
come
up
with.
mr.
floyd
abrams
and
when
they
balanced
the
first
amendment
interest
against
that--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--it
seems
to
me
that,
that
there
are
only
two
choices,
that
i
would
urge
on
you
at
least,
are
constitutional
choices.
one
is
to
adhere
to
buckley
and
to
do
so,
understanding
that,
or
accepting,
excuse
me,
that
express
advocacy
is
as
far
as
the
first
amendment
will
allow
you
to
go
in
terms
of
allowing
regulation.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
other
is
to
try
to
make
sense
in
the
sense
that
you
are
using
the
word,
your
honor,
sense
by
scrapping
it
and
in
a
sense
starting
over.
you
don't
have
to
scrap
it
in
order
to
strike
down
this
statute.
mr.
floyd
abrams
because
of
its
overbreadth.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
only
reason
and
the
only
justification
is
that
that
speech
becomes,
as
it
were,
so
much
like
a
contribution,
so
much
like
a
final
act
of
saying,
vote
for
the
candidate,
not
for
this
reason,
not
by
inference,
not
by
suggestion,
but
that
by
finally
giving
an
unambiguous
statement--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--it
was
afforded
that
little
sliver,
and
it
was
intended
to
be
a
sliver,
as
i
read
buckley
and
mcfl
was
afforded
less
constitutional
protection.
mr.
floyd
abrams
with
respect...
that
was
your
submission.
i
mean,
that,
that--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--no,
i'm
not
saying
it's
the
only
reason.
i
am
saying
that
a
flat
statement
saying
vote
for
somebody
can
be
distinguished
not
only
from
how
to
vote
on
the
panama
canal.
mr.
floyd
abrams
but--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
think
the
very
unambiguous
nature
of
it
might,
as
justice
scalia
suggests,
might
be
more
like...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
speech
law
has,
if
anything,
become
more
protective
since
buckley
in
the
first
amendment
area.
and
if,
if
you
were
to
move
in
either
direction,
i
would
certainly
urge
you
to
move
in
the
direction
of
affording
more
protection
to
the
direct
advocacy
that
justice
stevens
asked
me
about,
rather
than
less
protection
for
the
ad
that
i
provided
you
with,
congressman
myrick,
this
is
from
the
af
of
l,
congressman
myrick
vote
against
most
favors
nation's
treatment
for
communist
china.
now,
that
is
swept
in
as
part
of
electionary
communication.
and
i
would
certainly
urge
you
if
you
have
any
inclination
to
move
in
the
direction
of
moving
away
from
buckley,
and
there's
no
doubt
that,
that
there
are
parts
of
buckley
intentioned
with
each
other,
that
if
you
were
you
to
do
that
that
you
ought
not
to
allow
to
be
swept
in
the
unprotected
area
advertisements
like
that.
mr.
floyd
abrams
and
that's
an--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
you
mean--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--my
first
response
is
that
you
lose
a
lot
of
speech.
mr.
floyd
abrams
why?
because
there
much
less
money
we
will
be
obtained.
that
was
the
idea
of
it
was
to
take
money
out
of
politics,
if
you
will.
pacs
don't
raise
as
much
money
as
the
af
of
l
have.
the
af
of
l
spent
more,
the
record
reveals
on
its
advertisements,
than
it
raised
with
the
entirety
of
its
pac.
its
pac
raised
$1.1
million--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--and
spent
$16
million.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--well,
my
side
of
the
table,
your
honor,
has
not
exactly
advocated
limiting
joe
moneybags
and
giving
money
to
the
democratic
party.
that's
what
they're
saying.
what
i'm
saying
to
you
is
that
as
regards
an
organization,
either
the,
we
call
the
aclu,
the
af
of
l,
whichever
one
you
want
to
pick,
there
are
burdens
that
this
court
has
recognized,
serious
burdens
with
having
a
pac.
there
is
also
in
this
case
a
level,
a
level
of
falsity
that
the
entity
would
have
to
engage
in
with
respect
to
what
it
was
doing,
because
it
is
not
true
that
this
is
all
about
politics.
we
have
put
before
you
advertisements
which
are
not
simply
political
advertisements,
and
yet
to
solicit
someone
for
a
pac
you
must
notify
the
person
of
the
political
purposes
of
the
pac.
you
must
spend
the
money
only
for
political
purposes.
these
are
requirements
in
section
441b
with
respect
to
a
pac.
it
is
not
so
that
the
aclu
when,
if
it
wants
to
run
an
ad
in
the
last
60
days
of
the
2004
campaign
criticizing
president
bush
for
his
position
on
civil
liberties,
an
ad
that
would
be
criminal
under
this
statute
if
it
came
from
its
treasury
funds,
it
is
not
true
that
that
is
a
political
ad.
now,
our
friends
here
say,
well,
it
might
have
effect,
and
that's
something
i
want
to
talk
about.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i'm
not
talking
about
the
name.
justice
ginsburg,
it's
not
the
name--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--of
the
pac
that
i'm
worried
about.
i'm
talking
about
the
institution
of
a
pac
itself,
a
pac
pursuant
to
441b(6)(3)(b)
must
notify
anyone
solicited
of
its
political
purposes.
what
i'm
arguing
to
you
is
that--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--no,
i
don't
think
it
is
telling
someone
of
political
purposes
if
you
say,
we
are
not,
we
don't
have
political
purposes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
don't
know
what
they
would
do
under
this
criminal
statute.
i
do
not
think
that
the
aclu
ought
to
have
to
run
the
risk
of
the
fec
passing
judgment.
mr.
floyd
abrams
two
answers.
first,
that
is
not
usually
the
most
satisfactory
first
amendment
answer.
if
they
want
to
run
an
ad
in
the
middle
of
the
campaign,
to
have
to
go
to
the
government
to
get
permission
to
run--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
but--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--they
can
go...
they
can
seek
such
a
response
from
the
commission.
i
don't
think
my
friends
here
would
argue
with
me
that
that's
not
such
an
easy
effort.
it
takes
at
least
weeks
and
weeks
to
get
a
response.
there
are
new
organizations
being
formed
all
the
time
that
would
have
to
get
that
response.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
nra...
let
me
give
you
an
example.
the
nra
raised
an
enormous
amount
of
money
in
the
last
campaign.
they
were
mentioned
a
lot
on
the
floor
of
congress
with
great
unhappiness
by
a
lot
of
people.
they
appealed
to
80
million
gun
owners
in
america.
they
have
4
million
members.
under
the
standard
rules
that
apply
with
respect
to
a
pac,
they
could
only
get
money
from
the
4
million
people,
not
from
the
80
million.
they
could
not
raise...
they
raised
$300
million.
mr.
floyd
abrams
sorry.
i'm
finishing
it.
they
raised
$300
million
from
their
ads
on
television
and
spent
it
on
more
ads
to
get
out
their
views.
and
number
one,
i
think
that's
part
of
living
in
a
democratic
society.
number
two,
to
say
that
they
are
to
go
down
from
the
sort
of
level
they
were
at,
in
terms
of
the
people
they
may
appeal
to,
which
is
the
way
pacs
work
and
quite
properly
the
way
pacs
work.
but
that
they
must,
as
a
matter
of
law,
abandon
their
general
efforts
to
raise
money
from
the
public,
is
a
very
significant
burden
on--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--and
they're
only
allowed
to
solicit
from
their
membership.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
the
general
public--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--nrwc
says--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--no.
the
general
public
may
not
belong
to
the
pac.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
they
can
get
people
to
join
the
nr--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--look
at
the
burden
on
speech
that
we
are
talking
about
imposing
on
an
organization
like
this.
instead
of
making
general
appeals
to
the
public,
instead
of
having
their
say,
their
argument
in
saying,
send
us
money,
et
cetera--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--it
is
limited
to
members
of
the
nra.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
sir,
the
general
appeal
to
the
public
is
not
limited
to
the
nra.
mr.
floyd
abrams
but
people
were
free,
until
this
statute,
to
send
contributions
to
the
nra.
they
were
free
to
send
money,
not
just
to
join.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
the
difference
is
between
the
80
million
people
who
have
guns
and
the
4
million
who
are
now
members.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
everyone
who
has
a
cause
may
get
more
money,
yes.
will
they
run
the
same
ads
as
the
political
parties
would
have
run?
no.
will
they
run
the
same
ads
as
the
candidates
would
have
run?
i
don't
think
you
can
assume
that
either.
i
mean,
the
only
thing
in
your
record,
incidentally,
here,
about
a
breakdown
in
this
area,
and
i
think
this
may
be
of
interest
to
you,
is
that
in
the
2000
presidential
campaign,
of
all
the
ads
on
television,
51
percent
were
by
candidates,
41
percent
were
by
parties
and
8
percent
by
organizations
of
the
sort
that
we
are
talking
about
here
now.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
saying
that
what
you
call
their
own
money
includes
money
obtained
by
solicitations.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it's
to
join--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--it's
not
a
separate
fund.
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
it's
a
separate
fund.
i'm
saying
that
the
totality
of
the
amount
received
by
the
nra
includes
membership
fees
and
other
amounts
contributed
by
people.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i'm
not
telling
you
that
the
solicitations
are
made
in
those
words.
i'm
telling
you
that
is
what
happens.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
thought
of
putting
section
first
in
the
brief.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
justify,
justice
breyer,
striking
down
or
even
viewing
more
harshly,
that
is
to
say,
our
arguments.
that
is
to
say,
you
ought
not
to
reject
our
arguments
about
title
2.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
would
like
to
start
by
saying
that
you
mentioned
the
question
of
the
amount
of
ads
in
question.
i'm
not
going
to
get
involved
in
the
internecine
warfare
we've
had
about
quite
what
the
number
is.
but
i
do
want
to
indicate
that
we
have
one
judge,
judge
henderson,
who
has
indicated
that
it
is
at
least
34
percent
of
all
the
ads
are
by
any
standard,
quote,
genuine,
unquote,
and
perhaps
as
high
as
64
percent.
you
have
other
judges
and
entities
on
their
side
of
the
line
that
have
used
figures
like
14
percent
and
the
like.
now,
all
this
of
course
is
inconsistent
with
the
notion
of
what
express
advocacy
is.
but
taking
even
their
definitions,
as
it
was,
we're
talking
about
a
statute
which
by
any
standard
ever
used
by
this
court
would
be
deemed
to
be
overbroad.
to
say...
you
used
the
14
percent
number.
14
percent
of
these
ads...
and
i
think
there
are
many
more.
14
percent
are
ads
which
in
the
ordinary
course
would
be
considered,
quote,
genuine,
unquote,
however
we
define
that.
and
yet
sustain
a
statute
which
would...
and
i
use
the
word
deliberately...
criminalize
them.
mr.
floyd
abrams
let
me
say
the
word
genuine
comes
from
the
study
conducted
by
the
brennan
center,
in
which
they
asked
students
from
a
particular
university
to
opine
as
to
the
intent,
the
state
of
mind--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--the
state
of
the
mind
of
the
people
that
did
the
ads.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
all
it
was.
mr.
floyd
abrams
do
you
think...
you've
watched
these
ads,
you've
looked
at
these
ads.
don't
even
look
at
the
ads.
you've
looked
at
these
pictures
like
the
ones
that
are
at
the
back
of
my
brief
and
at
the
back
of
the
intervenor's
brief.
you've
looked
at
they
pictures.
tell
us,
now,
is
this
a
genuine
ad...
an
ad
genuinely
directed
at
an
issue
or
is
its
purpose
electoral?
they
did
not.
to
answer
you
directly
now...
did
not
permit
for
a
moment
an
answer
of
both.
mr.
floyd
abrams
absolutely.
mr.
floyd
abrams
what
i
think
you
can
make
is
this,
is
that
if
given
no
opportunity
at
all
to
say
both,
they
said
that
the
purpose,
in
their
mind,
was
not
electoral,
but
issue
oriented.
i
think
you
ought
to
give
us
at
least
that.
the
both
answer--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
sir,
yes.
it
was
the
defendant's
evidence.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
very
first
issue
ad
that
we
have
at
the
back
of
our
brief
is
one
by
a
term
limits
organization.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
yes,
and
it
brings
that
to
mind.
it's
a...
it's
term
limits
organization
saying,
we
have
our
pledge,
our
term
limits
pledge.
there
are
two
candidates.
one
has
not
signed
it.
the
other
one
has.
mr.
floyd
abrams
call
him
and
tell
him
to
sign
it.
call
david
wu,
urge
him
to
sign
it.
now,
i--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
think
that
one
is
probably
not.
i
think
that
one
is
a,
is
a
group
that
cares
less
about
elections
than
about
their
cause,
their
cause
is
term
limits.
mr.
floyd
abrams
people
do
call...
i'm
sorry.
the
record
before
you
shows
that
when
these
ads
run,
people
do
make
the
calls.
i
asked
senator
feingold
that
in
the
deposition
i
took
of
him.
i
asked
him,
do
you
get
calls?
and
the
answer
was
yes,
they
do
get
calls.
now
there's
no
doubt,
and
i
want
to
respond
to
this
very
directly,
that
many
of
these
ads
do
have
both
qualities,
that
is
to
say,
they
speak
about
an
issue,
and
they
have
an
electoral
component
to
them,
and
some
of
them
don't,
but
many
of
them
do.
and
we
would
urge
on
you
that
for
you
to
say
that
an
ad
of
that
sort
is
not
fully
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
not
just
in
the
abstract,
but
to
be
applied
as
you
consider
a
statute
like
this,
the
david
wu
ad.
whatever
one
concludes
the
underlying
purpose
was,
and
one
can't
know
for
sure
to
say
that
a
term
limits
organization
cannot
take
an
ad
out
in
the
last
60
days
of
a
campaign,
and
indeed
it
works
out
to
be
over
120
days
in
a
presidential
contest
in
the
sense
of
60
days
with
respect
to
the
election
date,
30
days
for
the
national
convention,
30
days
also
for
state
conventions,
primaries,
so
you
are
talking
about
120
days
minimum--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--of
silence.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
your
honor,
my
client
is
not,
has
not
raised
constitutional
objections
in
this
court
to
the
disclosure
requirements
and,
with
the
exception
of
504,
which
is
a
broadcast--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--similarly
there--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--but
that
is
not
because,
since
you
ask,
it's
not
because
we
don't
think
that
the
definition
is
unconstitutional
for
the
same
reasons
every
time
it's
used.
i
mean,
if
we're
right
that
this
definition,
put
buckley
aside
for
the
moment,
that
this
definition
is
fatally
overbroad
for
first
amendment
reasons.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
if
it
sweeps
in
so
much
more
than
the
first
amendment--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that's
true.
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
did
not
raise
in
this
court
an
issue
about
disclosure
now.
but
you
should--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that's
right.
but
that's
not
challenged.
the--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
think
it
is
overbroad
in
all
respects.
it,
it
could
be
constitutional.
mr.
floyd
abrams
constitutionally
overbroad,
yes.
i
think
one
can
make
a
case,
and
again,
we
didn't
challenge
the
foreign
part
of
it
at
all
that
there
may
be
different
considerations
afoot
there
which
would
perhaps
change
the
dynamics
of
your
decision
making.
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
on
the
basic
disclosure
matter
that
although
we,
that
is
to
say,
senator
mcconnell,
does
not
challenging
that,
the
aclu
is
challenging
it,
and
they
have
made
that
argument
in
their
brief
and
they
have
made
it
at
length
and
powerfully
to
the
effect
that
the
disclosure
requirements
as
per
buckley
should
be
the
same
as
the
requirement
or
the
viability
of
a
requirement
not
to
say
something,
as
well
as
certain
principles
of
anonymity.
as
i
say,
that's
not
the
argument
that
we're
making.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
one
way
to
say
it,
justice
stevens.
the
way
i
would
say
it
is
that
our
principal
objection
is
that
this
is
a
content-based
restriction
on
speech
which
punishes
speech
of--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--well,
to
the
extent
that
pacs
are
asserted
as
an
alternative--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--well,
hard
money,
it's
really
the
equivalent
of
pacs
in
this
situation.
i
mean,
hard
money
when
you
talk
about
the
af
of
l,
for
example,
what
is
hard
money
when
they
spend
their
own
money
on
their
own
ad?
it's
one
thing
to
say
they
have
to
do
it
through
a
pac.
we
think
it's
unconstitutional
to
force
that
with
respect
to
every
mention
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
it's
something
else
to
treat
it
as
if
somebody
else
is
giving
the
money.
this
is
not
a
contribution
situation
in
which
the
concept
of
hard
money
comes
into
play.
that's
why
i
was
rephrasing
it
in
terms
of
pacs.
let
me
say,
in
conclusion,
one
or
two
final
things.
this
is,
this
section,
with
what
we
consider
its
overbreadth,
is
illustrative
of
the
failures
and
constitutional
indifference
by
the
congress
to
first
amendment
norms
as
a
whole.
one
of
the
other
sections
we're
challenging
is
section
305,
which
is
the
section
which
says
under
the
title,
limitation
of
availability,
of
lowest
unit
charged
for
federal
candidates
attacking
opposition.
this
is
a
section
which
basically
says
in
so
many
words,
candidates
have
to
pay
more
money
or
make
more
disclosure.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
right.
mr.
floyd
abrams
and
therefore--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
represent
the
national
association
of
broadcasters
here.
i
think
i
can
say
there
is
a
chance
they
might
have
to
pay
more
if
the
statute...
if
the
statute
did
not
require
lowest
unit
rate.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
takes
away
a
statutory
entitlement
for
what?
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
which
is,
which
is
entirely
content-based.
they
take
them
away--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--you
do
not
have
to
under
311
have
a
printed
statement
identifying
that
the
candidate
approved
and
authorized
the
ad.
you
do
not
have
to
have
the
image
of
a
candidate
for
four
seconds.
mr.
floyd
abrams
thank
you
very
much.
