justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
i
thought
that
your
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question
was
that
the
right
to
speak
includes
the
right
to
speak
in
association
with
others.
isn't
that
the
position
that
your
brief
takes?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
some
states
might
choose
to
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
coin
a
phrase.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
assert
the
principle,
however,
that
the
federal
government
may
regulate
any
activity
which
has
an
effect
on
federal
elections?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
getting
a
governor
elected
or
getting
a
state
legislature
elected,
which
will
establish
electoral
districts
within
the
state
in
a
certain
fashion,
which
will
be
used
for
the
federal
election
as
well,
i
suppose
that
that
would
have
an
effect
on
the
federal
election,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
every
state
election
has
an
effect
on
federal
elections.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
in
order
to
avoid
that
boundless
proposition,
it
seems
to
me
you
cannot
accept
the
view
that
whatever
affects
federal
elections
can
be
regulated.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
accept
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
what
the
solicitor
general
says
is
quite
correct.
state
elections
affect
federal
elections,
so
state
elections
can
be
regulated.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
do
not
accept
the
proposition
that
whatever
affects
federal
regulations
can
be
regulated.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
an
administrative
convenience.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there's
other
administrative
conveniences
not
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can't
be
relying
on
the
principle
that
administrative
convenience
is
not
adequate.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
justice
breyer's
principal
point
was
that
there,
that
there's
no
restriction
on
the
national
parties
expending
funds.
they
just
have
to
expend
federal
money,
and
not,
not
state
money,
so-called
hard
money.
now,
i
assume
that
your
response
to
that
is
that
it
would
be
a
restriction
upon
my
speech
if
a
law
were
passed
which
said
scalia
can
take
out
advertisements
in
newspapers,
but
not
with
money
from
his
salary.
he
has
to
use,
he
has
to
use
other
funds.
would
that
not
be
a
restriction
of
my
speech?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
does
prohibit
it
when
they're
using
levin
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
is
it
an
option
for
the
national
party
or
for
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
option
for
the
state
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
a
state
party
could
destroy
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
general
olson,
is
every
problem
soluble?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
for
example,
the
executive
should
make
a
compelling
case
that
it
is
really
impossible
to
eradicate
crime
if
we
continue
with
this
silly
procedure
of
having
warrants
for
searches
of
houses?
we
wouldn't
entertain
the
argument
that,
you
know,
this
is
the
only
way
to
achieve
this
result.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
certain
absolutes,
aren't
there,
even
if
problems
subsist?
there
are
just
some
things
that
government
can't
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
we're
arguing
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
whether
there
are
problems.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
whether
this
is
something
that
government
simply
can't
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
understand...
to
be
very
basic,
let's
start
with
the
text.
congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech.
these
laws
abridge
the
freedom
of
speech
in
some
sense.
now,
on
what
basis
do
you
think
that
there
is
somehow
a
way
around
that
text?
i
can
think
of
several
ones.
you
can
say
the
freedom
of
speech
doesn't
mean
all
freedom
of
speech.
it
means
that
freedom
of
speech
which
was
traditional
at
the
time
the
provision
was
adopted.
so
you
could
not
libel,
you
could
not
give
information
about
the
sailing
of
troop
ships
and
whatnot.
but
this
wouldn't
come
under
that.
there
was
no
notion
of
restraining
expenditures
for
campaigning
when
the
provision
was
adopted.
a
second
alternative,
i
suppose,
is
that
the
freedom
of
speech
does
not
include
freedom
of
speech
by
malefactors
of
great
wealth,
corporations,
labor
unions
and
other
organizations
don't
have
freedom
of
speech.
but
our
cases
reject
that.
we
can't
require
the
new
york
times
to
be...
you
know,
any
organization
that
is
funded
by
more
than
a
million
dollars
cannot
say
anything
about
elections.
we
couldn't
say
that,
could
we?
so
how
do
you
get
around
the
very
simple
text
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
plausible,
i
suppose,
that
a
contribution
to
somebody
else,
to
speak
whatever
he
wants,
is
not
your
speech.
but
what
do
you
do
about
expenditures?
this
law
regulates
a
lot
of
expenditures.
justice
antonin
scalia
contributions
to
parties
were
limited
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
very
broadly
defined
federal
election
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
special
expertise
and
also
special
interest.
do,
do
you
know
any
provision
of
this
law
that
disadvantages
incumbents?
i
can
name
you
several
that
disadvantage
challengers.
is
there
any
provision
of
the
law
that
you
think
puts
incumbents
at
a
disadvantage?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
had
to
work
very
hard
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
record
is,
the
legislative
record
is
full
of
complaints
about
how
hard
it
is
to
raise
all
this
money
and
it's
a
lot
of
trouble.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
answer
to
my
question
is
no,
i
gather?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
name
any
provision?
i
can
name
several
that
disadvantages
challengers.
number
one,
the
very
existence
of
restrictions
upon
money
because
if
no
money
can
be
spent
at
all,
the
incumbent
is
going
to
win.
it's
well-known
that
the
challenger
needs
more
money.
number
two,
the
restrictions
on
parties
that
we
were
just
talking
about.
it
is
also
well-known
that
where
the
national
party
will
generally
spend
its
money
in
a
federal
election
is
in
supporting
a
challenger
in
a
district
or
in
a
state
where
the,
where
the
representative
or
the
incumbent
representative
or
senator
is
in
trouble.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
go
on.
the
millionaire
provision,
i
think,
advantages
incumbents.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
finish
my
thought.
what
i
conclude
from
this
is
that
perhaps
we
shouldn't
be
so
deferential
to
congress
in
this
matter.
you
know,
in
the
area
of
separation
of
powers,
we
do
not
defer
to
congress
when
congress
is
in
a
head-to-head
clash
with
the
executive
branch
on
separation
of
powers
matters.
why?
because
congress
is
self-interested
in
that
area.
why
is
it
not
the
case
that
congress
is
eminently
self-interested
in
making
laws
that
restrict
the
manner
in
which
people
can
challenge
their
re-election?
justice
antonin
scalia
too
much
money.
that's
the
problem.
too
much
money
is
being
spent
on
elections.
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
the
problem
you
are
solving
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
keep
calling
them
abuses.
people
were
taking
advantage
of
those
gaps
in
the
law
that
existed.
is
that
an
abuse,
every
time...
we
do
it
with
the
tax
code
all
the
time.
we
don't
say
oh,
it's
an
abuse.
he
took
advantage
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
water
will
run
downhill,
and
if
you
cannot
make
your
voices
heard
in
this
fashion,
they'll
find
another
fashion.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
that
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
mean?
could
he
be
introduced
at
the
event
as
the
chairman
of
the
republican
national
committee?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
i
want
to
know
what
that
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
couldn't
introduce
him
as
the
chairman
of
the
republican--
justice
antonin
scalia
--could
just
say
joe
dokes
endorses
the
government
and
don't
mention
that
this
is
the
chairman
of
the
national
republican
committee.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
corruption.
surely
the
possibility
of
corruption
is
much
more
direct
when
it's
the
candidate
himself
who
was
soliciting
for
this
organization,
which
will
then
help
him.
then
it
is
indirect,
where
the
national
party
solicits
and
it
may
get
to
him
or
not.
he
doesn't
know
what's
going
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
went
out
of
its
way
to
allow
incumbents
to
do
this.
went
out
of
its
way.
it
didn't
leave
a
gap.
it
said
we're
not
going
to
let
the
parties
do
this,
but
we
will
let
the
candidates
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
equating
the
party
with
the
individual.
and
the
party
is
no
more
the
individual
candidate
than
is
the
national
rifle
association
the
candidate
who
happens
to
ardently
oppose
gun
control.
and
the
question
that
justice
breyer
is
posing
is,
why
do
you
pick
on
the
party
as
this
instrument
for
making
public
views,
even
the
public
views
of
the
wealthy,
known
and
allow
contributions
to
these
other
groups?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
done
by
incumbents,
incidentally.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true,
but
they
usually
don't
pertain
to
what
it
takes
to
get
them
out
of
office.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
attack
ads.
the
legislative
record
is
full
of
hostility
toward
these
attack
ads.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
a...
that's
what
the
chief
was
saying.
that
is
not
a
valid
complaint.
we've
never
said
that's
a
valid
justification.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
why
they
didn't
want
to
go
to
breakfasts
and
lunches.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
many
people
think
that
what
produced
that
situation
was
the
original
campaign
finance
law,
which
set
individual
contribution
limits
so
low
that
you
indeed
had
to
go
around
scurrying
for
money,
because
you
couldn't
accept
greater
amounts
from
more
wealthy
donors.
justice
antonin
scalia
insignificantly,
if
that
is
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
mind
having
to
spend
all
the
time
raising
the
money.
i
thought
you
just
said
that
that's
bad.
now
you
say
it's
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
olson,
could
i
ask
you
to
address
the
regulation
of
state
parties
and
the
regulation
of
funds
spent
in
state
elections.
what,
what
basis
is
there
for
the
federal
government
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
isn't
what
the
law
says,
that
when
it's
ostensibly
for
the...
if
you're
using
it
in
the
best
of
good
faith
to
get
out
the
vote
for
a
state
election,
even
when
the
federal
election
in
this
particular
state
is
a
forgone
conclusion.
there
is...
one
party
has
it
so
locked
up
that
the
federal
election
is
a
nullity,
and
all
of
the
money
is
being
spent
on
a
state
election.
justice
antonin
scalia
nonetheless,
the
federal
government
says
these
are
the
rules
under
which
the
state
party
can
spend
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
in
my
hypothetical.
in
my
hypothetical,
it's
not
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
narrow
tailoring?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
narrow
tailoring?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
situations
like
that.
there
is
more
than
one.
i
think
that's,
that's
likely
to
be
very
common.
justice
antonin
scalia
talk
is
cheap.
i
mean,
access
is
not
votes.
sure,
members
of
congress
are
going
to
give
time
to
people
who
have
given
money
to
their
campaign.
it
doesn't
mean
they
are
going
to
vote
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
is
this
corruption?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
giving
of
more
time
to
them,
is
that
corruption,
or
the
appearance
of
corruption?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
the
bottom
line.
that's
the
moment
of
truth.
do
you
get
any
votes
for
the
money
that
you
contribute
to
the
candidate?
if
you
don't
get
that,
you
are
getting
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
muzzle
them,
muzzle
them,
too.
that's
the
solution.
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
do
you
say
that?
the
parties
have
opposed
this
legislation.
they
are
on
the
other
side
of
this
case,
and
you
are
coming
here
and
telling
me
that
the
congress
is
more
concerned
about
the
good
of
the
parties
than
the
parties
themselves
are.
they
are
on
the
other
side.
they
think
it's
hurting
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waxman--
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
the
state
committee
has
chosen
the
option?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
for
me.
i'm
not
sure
it
was
for
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
it's
more
likely
to
induce
gratitude
and
hence
more
likely
to
lead
to
the,
quote,
appearance
of
corruption.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
your
basic
point
is
that
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
raise
as
much
money
as
the
organization
itself
has
at
its
disposal
anyway,
whatever
you
call
the
pac.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
there
is
a
membership
fee
that
goes
along
with
joining
most
organizations.
so
if
you
want
to
contribute
$25
to
the
campaign,
you
would
have
to
contribute
50,
in
effect,
to
join
the
nra,
plus
the
25.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
this
a
really
good
university?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
confess
that
i
don't,
i
don't
really
understand,
it's
more,
what
is
the
purpose
of
an
issue
ad
unless
it
is
to
persuade
the
voter
to
take
some
action
that
will
enable
that
issue
to
carry
the
day,
and
the
only
action
a
voter
can
take
is
to
vote
for
one
person
or
another
person.
i
mean,
isn't
every
issue
ad
an
appeal
to
voters?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
designed
to
have
an
effect
upon
the
election,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
laurence
gold?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
the
laurence
gold
i
expected.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
go
to
our
jurisprudence
was
where,
where
the
restriction
in
question
is
invalid
or
arguably
invalid
under
a
specific
constitutional
guarantee,
such
as
the
first
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
resort
to
substantive
due
process
to
create
some
general
liberty
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
should
have
been
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
makes
a
big
change.
it's
one
thing
to
say
the
corporation
is
affirmatively
giving
money
to
the
candidate
or
naming
the
candidate,
but
to
say
that
a
corporation
cannot
take
out
an
issue
ad
which
happens
to
mention
a
candidate,
any
candidate,
federal
candidate
during
a
certain
period,
that
goes
far
beyond
whatever
has
happened
before,
and
what,
you
know,
you
talk
about
corporations
as
though
well,
who
needs
corporations?
is
there
any
significant
segment
of
our
economy
that
is
not
run
by
corporations?
can
you
think
of
any
significant
segment
of
our
economy?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
and
if
that
segment--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
that
segment
of
an
economy,
of
the
economy
is
attacked
by
a
certain
piece
of
legislation,
which
that
segment
of
the
economy
thinks
is
a
very
stupid
piece
of
legislation,
and
it
will
entirely
wash
out
nuclear
energy
or
whatever
it
is,
to
say
that
the
american
people
who
have
organized
themselves
economically
through
corporations
cannot
through
the
same
mode
defend
that
segment
of
the
economy
against
irrational
legislative
action
is
to
very
much
weaken,
it
seems
to
me,
the
power
of
the
people
to,
to
have
a
real
say
in
the
acts
of
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
issue,
any
issue
advocacy
affects
elections.
that's
the
purpose
of
it
ultimately,
to
get
the
people
to
agree
with
whoever
is
making
the
issue
ad
about
the
issue
and
to
elect
candidates
who
will
come
out
that
way.
so
it
seems
to
me
a
very
artificial
distinction
you're
making.
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
essentially
saying
you
cannot
have
issue
ads.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
observed
reality,
if
history
teaches
us
anything,
is
that
when
you
plug
one
means
of
expression,
the
money
will
go
to
whatever
means
of
expression
are
left
and
that
will
continue
to
be
the
observed
reality
and
that
means
we
will
continue
to
have
new
pieces
of
legislation
that
close
more
and
more
methods
of
reaching
the
public.
this
does
not
fill
me
with
confidence
and
joy.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
whether...
the
fact
that
we
said
that
it's
okay
in
another
context
doesn't
mean
that
it's
okay
in
this
context.
it
depends
on
what
the
consequence
of
not
being
able
to
do
it
except
through
a
pac
happens
to
be.
and
here
the
consequence
is
very
severe
indeed.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
the
burden
ought
to
be
on
you
to
demonstrate
that
it
won't
hurt
them,
not
on
them
to
demonstrate
that
it
will.
you
are
preventing
them
from
using
their
money
for
speech.
you're
saying
this...
your
normal
money
can't
be
used
for
it.
you
have
to
get
money
from
some
other
source.
and
you
want
them
to
have
to
demonstrate
that
this
will
harm
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
five
to
four
and
don't
blame
it
on
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
a
corporation
spend
any
money,
whether
for
political
speech
purposes
or
otherwise,
that
is
not
directed
towards
the
fostering
of
its
business?
wouldn't
they
be
leaving
themselves
open
to
a
lawsuit
by
the
shareholders?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
raising
the
question
to
respond
to
your
point
that
shareholders
don't
agree
with
every
jot
and
tittle
of
what
the
corporation
does.
they
don't
in
the
economic
field
either.
very
often
some
of
the
things
that
corporations
should
divest
itself
of
a
certain
business,
others
think
they
shouldn't.
they
have
ceded
to
the
organization...
this
is
part
of
belonging
to
an
organization...
the
responsibility
to
determine
what
is
in
the
interest
of
that
corporation.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
no
less
true
with
respect
to
political,
especially
issue
ads
as
to
what
issues
are
important
for
that
corporation's
survival.
i
don't
know
why
all
of
a
sudden
we
insist
on
unanimity
among
the
shareholders
when
it
comes
to
that
very
important
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clement,
why
do
you
make
an
exception
for
these
corporations,
these
aggregations
of
vast
wealth
that
happen
to
own
television
stations?
general
electric,
for
example,
which,
if
i
recollect
correctly,
owns
nbc.
why
is
it
perfectly
okay
for
them
to
have
issue
ads,
name
candidates,
oppose
candidates?
they're
not
covered,
there's
an
exception
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
just
nbc,
which
is
owned
by
general
electric.
so
everybody
should
go
out
and
get
himself
a
television
station,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why
is
that?
why
is
that?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
like
austin,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clement,
austin
aside,
do
you
know
of
any
case
of
ours
that
says
that
the
press,
quote,
has
greater
first
amendment
rights
than
joe
mimeograph
machine?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
fact,
we've
said
just
the
opposite.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
wasn't
the
argument,
that
the
press
has
to
be
subject
to
these
limitations.
the
argument
is,
since
these
limitations
would
obviously
be
bad
as
applied
to
the
press,
they
are
bad
as
applied
to
everybody
else,
because
everybody
else
has
the
same
rights
as
the
press.
i
don't
know
why,
why
should
it
be
that
the
corporation
of
great
wealth...
let
me
put
the
question
this
way.
could,
could
congress
pass
a
law
saying,
we
are
concerned
about
the
influence
of
major
media
corporations,
mr.
murdoch?
we
are
going
to
pass
a
law
that
no
corporation
can
own
more
than
two
national
newspapers.
would
that
law
be
valid?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean,
you
mean,
you
think
i'm
saying
that
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting,
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
what
i'm
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
are,
we're
not
talking
about
regulating
the
broadcast
media.
that's
the
whole
point.
they
are
the
only
people
here
who
aren't
regulated.
it's
people
who
are
trying
to
get
their
views
across
through
these
media
who
are
regulated.
it's
not
the
media
who
are
regulated.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
happens
to
the
language,
or
contracts
to
make?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
regulation
just
reads
that
out
of
existence?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
in
202.
any
person,
if
any
person
makes
or
contracts
to
make
any
disbursement
for
an
electioneering
communication.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
goes
on
to
say,
such
disbursement
or
contracting
shall
be
treated
as
a
contribution
and
as
an
expenditure.
such
disbursement
or
contracting,
so
i
assume
the
contracting
immediately
falls--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
challenged
and
upheld.
i
mean,
there's
so
much
that
was
in
feca,
and
there's
so
much
more
that's
in
this
that
hasn't
been
challenged
here.
i
mean,
simply
to
say
it's
been
around
for
30
years
doesn't,
doesn't
convince
me
that
it's
valid.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
they
haven't
banned
attack
ads?
it's
very
hard
to
devise
a
good
punchy
attack
ad
that
doesn't
name
the
person
you're
attacking.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
the
price
of
getting
rid
of
the
attack
ads
is
that
i
have
to
ban
some
of
the
praising
ads
as
well,
it's
worth
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
disclosure
thing
is
a
different
problem,
but
why
banning
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
raised
the
risk
of
corruption
or
the
appearance
of
corruption,
the
fact
that
they...
i
mean,
i
agree
with
you
that
they
named
candidates.
what
is
wrong,
so
long
as
you
disclose
who
it
is,
that's
a
different
issue.
but
so
long
as
you
disclose
who's
doing
it,
what
is
wrong
with
their
naming
a
candidate?
justice
antonin
scalia
only
for
the
subsidiary
of
general
electric,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
nbc
can
say
whatever
it
wants,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
else
is
there,
besides...
i
mean,
it's
going
to
be
in
a
sit
come?
