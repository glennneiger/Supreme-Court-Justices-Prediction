mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
below
unanimously
concluded
that
section
318,
the
prohibition
of
contributions
by
minors
is
unconstitutional.
the
statute
suffers
from
three
constitutional
defects.
first,
section
318
is
a
ban,
not
simply
a
limitation.
no
symbolic
or
associational
speech
rights
are
recognized
under
318.
second,
the
government
failed
to
produce
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
there
was
corruption
or
the
appearance
of
corruption
with
regard
to
conduit
giving
by
minors.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
judge
henderson
called
the
evidence
remarkably
thin.
judge
kollar-kotelly
called
the
evidence
so
minimal
as
to,
in
her
words,
doom
the
statute.
section
318
is
not
closely
drawn
in
support
of
the
interests
being
asserted.
in
fact,
the
government
concedes
that
this
statute
is
an
absolute
ban
and
they
also
concede
that,
in
fact,
the
ban
burdens
more
speech
than
a
limitation.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
certainly
that
would
be
more
closely
drawn,
justice--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
think
so.
the
issue
would
be
could
an
8
year-old
make
the
voluntary
decision
to
make
a
contribution.
i
think
it
would
be
a
closer
case.
this
is
an
absolute
ban,
though.
this
is
the
exact
opposite
of
that
situation.
rather
than
looking
at
a
concern
over--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
think
it
would
be
the
same
argument.
at
a
minimum,
there
would
have
to
be...
they
would
have
to
establish
that
the
ban
was
justified
by
at
least
a...
closely
drawn
to
the
concern.
i
think
when
you
get...
the
younger
it
gets
obviously
it
is
more
of
a
problem.
but
here
you
have
a
ban
actually--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--all
legislation
is
line
drawing.
here--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--that's
exactly
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
fact
is,
as
judge
leon
recognized,
the
younger
the
child
gets,
the
less
likely
are
they
to
have
resources.
but
here
again,
as
the
government
concedes,
this
is
an
absolute
ban
for
17
and
under.
it
is
not
worrying
about
just
two
year
olds
or
four
year
olds.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i'll
give
you
the
six
month
old.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
justice
breyer,
two
things
are
wrong
with
that
proposition.
first,
the
first
amendment
rights
of
speech
and
association
are
not
somehow
contingent
upon,
dependent
upon
exercise
of
the
right
to
vote
under
the
26th.
secondly...
and
a
perfect
example
of
that
would
be
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
19th
amendment,
women
were
denied
the
right
to
vote
in
the
united
states
but
they
certainly
could
still
exercise
the
rights
of
speech
and
association
to
obtain
the
right
of
suffrage.
and
i
think
it
would
be
exactly
the
same
argument.
also,
in
fact,
in
11
states,
17
year
olds
actually
can
vote
in
primaries
so
long
as
they
reach
the
age
of
18
by
the
next
general
election.
so
there
are
states
in
which
in
fact
it
can
be
that
the
17
year
old
can
vote.
but
that
i
think
also
proves
up
the
problem
here.
and
that
is,
if
the
government's
justification
for
the
prohibition...
and
here
this
absolute
prohibition...
is
in
fact
that
there
is
a
concern
over
conduit
giving,
the
existing
regulations
and
existing
law,
441(a)
and
(f),
prohibit
excess
or
contributions
given
in
the
name
of
another,
a
conduit
gift.
that
is
absolutely
prohibited.
contributions
given
in
the
name
of
another
within
the
same
provision,
prohibited.
and
of
course,
441(a)
prohibits
gifts
in
excess
of
the
contribution
limits.
this
statute
doesn't
say
that
a
17
year
old
who
is...
actually
under
this
statute,
a
17
year
old
who
has
her
own
means
of
support,
who
might
even
be
emancipated,
whose
parents
may
have
never
given
$1
to
a
campaign
are
put
in
the
situation
where
their
gift
is
banned.
it's
unauthorized
and
inappropriate,
illegal
under
the
statute.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
actually,
our...
our
discussion
about
that
restrictions
relates
to
what
some
of
the
other
states
have
done
by
allowing
if
no
states
bans
gifts
by
minors,
some
stays
do
impose
what's
called
family
contribution
caps
or
limitations.
again,
certainly
that
would
be
more
closely
drawn
than
an
absolute
prohibition.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
well,
we
would
accept
this
fact.
if
the
government
could
establish
through
evidence
that
in
fact
somehow
a
restriction
on
the
incremental
amount
allowed
to
be
given
would
meet
the
criteria
of
avoiding
corruption
or
the
appearance
of
corruption,
if
the
government
established
that,
sure,
but
they
haven't.
i
was
using
that
as
an--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--that
would,
i
think
it
would
certainly
make
it
more
difficult,
justice
ginsburg,
to
make
a
facial
challenge
if
the
gift,
the
symbolic
gift
and
the
associational
rights
were
recognized
by
a
cap.
but
again,
this
is
a
ban.
it
doesn't
allow
that
individual
17-year-old,
16-year-old,
15-year-old
to
make
that
gift.
we
were
trying
to
show
through
that,
those
examples
of
what
some
of
the
states
have
done
to
allow
gifts
to
made
by
minors
but
at
the
same
time
putting
what's
called
family
caps
in
place.
it
would
certainly
make
it
more
difficult
as
a
facial
challenge,
but
again,
this
is
a
prohibition
event.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
well,
i
would
argue
both.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
and
i
certainly
would
assert
again
that
what
the
individuals
planned
on
giving
here
is
a
liberty
interest,
but
it's
a...
it's
also
speech,
it's
also
association.
the
underpinning
of
this
court's
justifications
for
limitations
is
the
fact
that
an
act
of
some
type
can
be
given,
a
gift
could
be
given.
here,
it's
a
complete,
again,
a
complete
prohibition.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
well,
okay.
then
the
answer
will
be
no.
but
it
certainly
is
a
first
amendment
interest,
and
that's
what
we've
asserted
throughout
this,
that
there
is
both
the
speech
and
the
association--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes,
but
that
was...
the
hypothetical
was
assuming
that
that
wasn't
available.
however,
the
first
amendment--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--well,
i
would
certainly
like
to
have
yours,
justice
stevens.
the...
i
think
the
bottom
line
of
this
ban
is
what
came
up
in,
was
one
of
the
opinions,
is
no
one
knows
exactly
where
this
came
from.
there
is
no
evidence
that
was
submitted
of
any
significance
justifying
this
prohibition.
administrative
convenience
in
enforcement
is
certainly
not
a
basis
for
curtailing
speech
or
associational
rights.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
actually,
justice
breyer,
they
wrote
in
a--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--in
the
reports
that
there
was,
they
thought
there
was
a
concern,
or
evidence
that
they
said,
there
was
concerns
over
conduit
giving.
however,
actually
the
fec
could
never
make
the
conclusion,
though,
nor
could
congress
because
neither
congress
or
the
fec
ever
asked
for
the
age
of
the
donor,
so
they
could
not
determine
whether
in
fact
there
was
a
violation
of
conduit
giving
in
and
of
itself,
that's
already
prohibited
under
441a
and
f.
they
don't
even
ask
for
the
age
of
the
contributor,
so
to
go
from
a
situation,
and
by
the
way,
they
never
asked
for
a
complete
ban.
the
fec
in
all
of
its
recommendations
never
asked
for
an
absolute
ban
on
considerations
by
minors
to
be
put
in
place.
they
had
a
presumption
issue
for
those
that
were
15,
14,
and
13,
under
15
and
under,
but
that
was
a
request
for
a
presumption
which
was
rebuttable,
rebuttable
under
voluntariness,
rebuttable
if
in
fact
it
was
from
funds
controlled
by
the
minor
and
it
wasn't
a
gift
directed
by
the
parent.
for
these
reasons,
the
fact
that
this
is
a
ban,
this
is
not
a
limitation,
we
would
request
the
court
affirm.
thank
you.
