unknown
speaker
and
the
solution
is
to
say
one,
all
pennies
spent
by
the
federal
committee
are
federal,
and
though
the
limitations
of
$50,000
a
year
in
total
apply.
unknown
speaker
--and
there
will
be
abuses
under
this
law,
too.
unknown
speaker
so
why
is
that
such,
what
is,
particularly,
and
i
wanted
to
you
to
get
to
this,
if
the
disclosure
regulations,
the
new
ones,
the
new
provisions
in
the
law
on
independent
expenditure--
unknown
speaker
so
what
the
interest
at
stake
here
is
the
nonmembers
of
the
nra
who
want
to
support
the
policies
of
the
nra?
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
what...
what
other
purpose
does
it
have?
is
it
asking
them
to
leave
money
in
their
will,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
pacs,
using
hard
money
as
an
alternative.
unknown
speaker
you
do
argue
both?
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
there
are
none.
