justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
are
talking
about
the
right
to
speak
in
association
with
others,
does
that
apply
to
individuals
or
does
a
group
have
a
right
to
speak
in
association
with
other
groups?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
consistent
we
have
never
held
that,
have
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
burch--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
burchfield,
can
i
ask
kind
of
a
basic
question,
maybe
it's
assumed
here,
but
directing
your
attention
to
323(a)
in
the
general
point
of
323(a),
do
you
think
a
federal
statute
would
be
constitutional
if
it
simply
said
national
political
parties
may
not
accept
any
contributions
from
profit-making
corporations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that's
the
heart
of
your
position,
and
i
think
it's
unsupported
by
our
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
burchfield,
can
i
just
be
sure
that
i
understand
one
thing?
you're
saying
the
federal...
national
committee
may
not
transfer
any
money
to
the
local
committee
in
that
situation.
but
doesn't
the
statute
merely
say
it
must
transfer
hard
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
provision...
you're
not
relying
on
323(b)(1).
justice
john
paul
stevens
(b)(1)
just
prohibits
transfer
of
anything
except
hard
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
condition
to
using
levin
funds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
basic
prohibition
in
(b)
is
just
a
prohibition
on
the
use
of
any
money
other
than
the
hard
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
only
if
you
get
to
the
levin
amendment
that
your
argument
is
relevant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
we're
understanding
each
other
and
what
the
statute
provides.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
true
that
the
basic
prohibition
in
(b)
does
not
prevent
a
national
party
from
transferring
hard
money
to
local
committees
for
any
purpose
whatsoever?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
statute
doesn't
require
them
to
use
levin
money,
so
they
do
have
an
option
to
transfer
hard
money
to
local
committees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
still
remains
true
that
the
use
of
levin
funds
is
an
option
to
the
national
party,
not
a
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
not
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
an
option
for
the
national
party
because
323(b)
is
directed
at
the
national
parties.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry,
you're
right,
it's
a
state
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
olson--
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
olson,
i
suppose
another
reason
why
we
should
not
defer
to
the
incumbents
is
they
have
an
interest
in
spending
their
time
working
for
the
public
rather
than
raising
money,
and
this
will
save
a
lot
of
time
so
that
we
shouldn't
defer
to
them
on
it,
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
that...
by
just
saving
time
for
government
work
is
not
a
valid
interest
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
should
they
waste
all
their
time
raising
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
also,
i
suppose,
unlikely
that
they
would
contribute
both
to
the
nra
and
also
to
a
gun
control
organization,
which
they
do--
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
another
distinction,
too.
that
case,
the
prohibition
on
expenditures
there
applied
to
both
hard
and
soft
money.
we're
only
talking
about
prohibitions
that
did
not
involve
hard
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
abrams--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
shouldn't
you
at
least
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--able
to
answer,
answer
the
question,
why
should
a
speech
urging
expressly
to
elect
a
particular
candidate
to
the
president
of
the
united
states,
why
should
that
speech
be
entitled
to
less
constitutional
protection
than
a
speech
urging
the
ratification
of
the
panama
canal
treaty,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you'd
therefore
get
less
constitutional
protection.
that's
what
you're
saying,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
second-class
speech
under
your
submission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
the
only
reason
is
that
buckley
said
so,
and
so
we'll
stick
to
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
agree
it
can
be
distinguished--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
question
is,
why
should
it
get
less
constitutional
protection
than
the
other
speech?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
your
general
appeals
to
the
public,
it
seems
to
me,
are
to
join
the
nra.
and
therefore,
the
universe
of
people
who
are
financing
the
advertisement
is
limited
to
members
of
the
nra.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
the
same
limitation
as
on
the
pac.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
appeal
to
the
public
is
not
just
to
make
this
ad.
it's
to
join
the
nra
and
get
all
the
benefits
of
membership,
which
include
a
magazine
and
all
sorts
of
other
things.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
you
clarify
something
in
the
record
for
me?
because
i
was
under
the
impression
with
regard
to
the
nra,
that
there
basically
were
two
pots
of
money,
the
pac
money
and
its
own
money,
and
its
own
treasury,
if
it
had
wanted
to
spend
its
own
money.
you're
telling
me
the
real
vice
in
this
is
that
there
is
a
third
category,
namely
money
solicited
from
gun
owners
who
are
nonmembers,
but
could
not
belong
to
the
pac.
are
you
saying
that
that
third--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
that's
to
join
the
nra.
there
is
not
a
separate
fund--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--contributed
to
by
gun
owners.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
abrams--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
interrupt
you
with
a
sort
of
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--basic
question
here?
the
definition
of
electioneering
communications
appears,
i
think,
six
or
seven
times
in
the
statute
and
one
says
there
must
be
certain
disclosures
and
other--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
must
be
something
in
the
ad
itself
identifying
the
sponsor.
it
prevents
foreign
nationals
from
contributing
to
these
ads
and
so
forth.
do
you
contend
that
it's
unconstitutional
in
all
its
applications,
specifically,
for
example,
the
requirement
that
they
disclose
who
paid
for
the
particular
ad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
about
the
reporting
requirement,
the
requirement
that
they
report
to
the
commission
who
the
sponsors
are?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
objection--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
all
its
applications.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
requirement
that
is
imposed
by
the
definition
in
some
instances
is
merely
disclosing
who
paid
for
the
ads.
justice
john
paul
stevens
another
requirement
is
that
foreign
nationals
may
not
pay
for
such
things.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
could
be
constitutional
in
some
applications
and
not
others?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
when
you
say
overbroad,
you
mean
it's
too
broad
to
be
constitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
principal
challenge
is
to
the
requirement
that
these
ads
be
paid
for
with
hard
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
punishes
it
only
to
the
extent
that
it
identifies
who
or
who
may
not
pay
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
that's
right.
it
says
they
don't
get
a
statutory
entitlement
to
a
cheaper
rate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
it
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
don't
necessarily
have
to
pay
more
money
if
the
station
doesn't
charge
them
more
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
the
statute
does
is
take
away
a
statutory
entitlement,
not
require
that
they
pay
a
higher
price.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
itself
is
content-based.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
could...
could
i
interrupt
again?
you're
not
really
prescribed
for
money
in
them,
you're
really
prescribed
from
using
union
funds,
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
is
that
some
union
members
may
disagree
with
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
from
the
taft-hartley
act
on,
it's
been
understood,
i
thought,
that
one
objection
to
the
union's
spending
its
own
money
was
it
may
not
reflect
the
views
of
all
its
members.
that's
true
of
issue
ads
and
election
ads.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
interest
you're
vindicating
here
is
all
the
television
viewers
during
election
periods
seeing
all
these
30
minute
spots
over
and
over
and
over
again,
that's
the
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
part
of
the
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sekulow,
is
it
necessary
to
rely
on
the
first
amendment
to
reach
your
conclusion,
or
could
you
argue
this
an
unreasonable
restraint
on
liberty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
giving
money
is
the
first
amendment,
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
rather
have
his
vote
than
mine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
clement,
i
think
just
as
a
matter
of
history,
that
the
decision
in
the
belotti
against
first
national
bank
of
boston
invalidated
the
statute
that
was
really
typical
throughout
the
united
states
at
the
time.
generally,
there
was
in
the
olden
times
a
policy
against
using
corporate
funds
for
political
purposes
at
all.
so
the
history
i
think
is
consistent
with
the
position
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
buckley
a
point
on
this?
wasn't
there
an
exception
in
the
statute
in
buckley?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
challenge
it.
that's
the
reason.
justice
john
paul
stevens
haven't
we
held
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
haven't
we
held
that
licensees
can
be,
radio
licensees
and
television
can
be
compelled
to
give
equal
time
to
opposing
points
of
view
but
you
can't
compel
the
newspapers
to
do
that?
