mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
title
i
is
both
fatally
overbroad
in
achieving
any
federal
interest
and
nonsensically
underinclusive.
to
paraphrase
the
court
in
national
conservative
pac,
we
are
not
here
quibbling
about
fine-tuning
prophylactic
measures.
we
are
here
challenging
fundamental
restrictions
on
core
political
party
activities.
indeed
the
court
noted
in
buckley
that
no
societal
interests
would
be
achieved
if
a
loophole
closing
measure
allowed
unscrupulous
persons
and
organizations
to
spend
unlimited
amounts
to
influence
a
federal
candidate.
joe
wealthy
is
george
soros,
justice
breyer,
who
the
media
reports--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--and
totally
unregulated.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
correct,
justice
breyer.
but
we
know
from
colorado
i
that
not
all
activities
of
political
parties
are
coordinated
with
their
candidates
and
we
know
from
the
current
regime,
from
the
regime
that
has
been
in
effect
for
more
than
a
decade,
that
all
donations
to
political
parties,
federal
money,
non-federal
money
or
anything
else,
is
fully
disclosed
and
reported.
so
at
least
under
the
system
that
we
have
had
with
political
parties,
the
political
parties
are
accountable
and
are
transparent.
let
me
say
a
few
words
about
the
allocation
regulations,
just
to
make
sure
that
we're
all
clear
about
what
the
allocation
regulations
do
and...
did
and
do
not
do.
in
the
15.6
million
dollars
of
non-federal
money
that
the
republican
national
committee
spent
in
the
2001
off-year
election,
when
there
were
no
federal
candidates
on
the
ballot--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--exactly,
when
there
were
no
federal
candidates
on
the
ballot,
odd-year
elections.
the
allocation
regulations
allowed
the
rnc
to
spend
whatever
it
could
raise
and
whatever
it
wanted
to
spend
subject
to
state
law.
the
allocation
regulations
did
not
apply.
that
is
a
perfect
accommodation,
in
our
view,
of
the
state
interest,
of
the
state
interest
in
regulating
its
own
electoral
affairs.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
in
a
presidential
year,
your
honor,
the
fec,
after
much
deliberation,
made
the
determination
that
the
national
parties
would
be
presumptively
more
involved
in
federal
locations
those
years
than
in
state
elections.
but
they
still
recognized...
the
fec
has
still
recognized
that
the
national
parties
are,
in
fact,
national
parties,
not
federal
parties,
and
therefore,
they
can
spend
35
percent
on
allocable
activities,
even
in
a
federal
election
year
as
in
2000
when
the
rnc
gave
$5.6
million
of
non-federal
money
to
state
and
local
candidates.
that
money
is
not
subject
to
the
allocation
regulations.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
put
it
well
in
siebold
over
a
century
ago
when
it
said,
for
those
activities
that
had
exclusive
reference
to
a
state
election,
the
federal
government
has
no
role.
but
when
there
are
joint
activities
that
have
an
effect
on
both
elections,
the
regulating
entity,
state
government
or
federal
government,
cannot
impair
or
nullify...
is
the
term
the
court
used
then...
impair
or
nullify
the
other
sovereign's
interest.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
your
honor--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--your
honor,
that
is
the
solicitor
general's
position
here.
it
is
a
boundless
proposition
that
leaves
the
states
no
room
to
legislate
on
their
own
elections
because
they
contend...
you're
exactly
right.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
i
do
accept
that
proposition.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
i
do
accept
that
proposition.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
well,
there
is
a
certain
point
at
which
the
effect
becomes
so
attenuated
that
the
sovereign
interests
of
the
state
becomes
paramount.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
i
would
say
it
has
to
be
exclusive
reference
under
the
siebold
regime,
your
honor.
if
it's
a
direct
donation
to
a
state
candidate,
if
it
is
a
get
out
the
vote
phone
bank
that
advocates
that
the
voters
go
to
the
poll
and
vote
for
the
governor,
if
it
is
a
mailing,
as
under
the
california...
as
the
california
party
affidavits
of
ms.
bowler
and
mr.
irwin
indicate,
that
they
send--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--your
honor,
allow
me
to
disagree
with
that
justification.
323(a)
prohibits
the
solicitation,
receipt,
direction,
transfer
and
spending.
it's
a
felony
for
the
chairman
of
the
rnc
today
to
send
a
fund-raising
letter
asking
for
$100
donation
to
any
of
the
california
gubernatorial
candidates.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
the
rnc
can
spend
as
much
hard
money
in
state
elections,
consistent
with
state
law
and
in
some
states,
in
connecticut,
such
as...
and
that's
set
forth
in
mr.
josefiak's
affidavit,
where
it's
not
even
clear
that
the
national
parties
can
participate
because
the
national...
the
federal
limits
are
higher
than
the
state
limits.
and
there
are
some
states
where
the
national
party
under
this
regime
is
going
to
be
constrained
to
participate
even
in
state--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--the
response
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
the
statute
speaks
far
more
broadly
than
contributions.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
exactly,
your
honor.
and
it's
also
worth
noting
here
that
the
allocation
regulations
that
the
senatorial
or
congressional
committees
operate
under
are
governed
by
the
actual
amounts
spent
on
state
and
local
activity,
subject
to
a
percentage
of
a
60
percent
cap.
if
they
don't
engage
in
at
least
40
percent
state
election
activity,
their
federal
percentage
is
higher
than
60
percent.
so
that
the
allocation
ratios
are
calibrated
to
address,
in
the
real
world,
what
the
parties
are
actually
doing
in
the
state
and
local
realm.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
it
is
an
administrative
convenience.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
well,
your
honor--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--your
honor--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--justice
scalia,
we
are
not
here
today
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
allocation
regulations,
but
i
did
sense
that
there
might
be
some
misunderstanding
about
how
they
operated,
and
i
wanted
to
at
least
make
clear
that
the
allocation
regulations
do
not
purport...
did
not
purport
to
regulate
purely
state
and
local
candidate
activity,
at
the
national
party
level
or
at
the
state
party
level.
a
very
large
proportion
of
what
the
california
democratic
and
republican
parties
do
was
not
within
the
scope
of
the
allocation
regulations.
here,
under
this
statute,
under
section
323(b),
the
only
activities
in
even
years
that
state
and
local
parties
can
engage
in,
according
to
ms.
bowler's
affidavit...
she's
the
executive
director
of
the
california
democratic
party...
are
direct
donations
to
candidates,
to
state
and
local
candidates,
and
state
party
conventions.
everything
else,
including
a
phone
bank
to
oppose
a
school
voucher
initiative
such
as
prop.
38
that
was
on
the
november
2000
ballot,
and
that's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
1721,
the
actual
phone
banks
clip,
that
is
completely
federalized
today.
but
the
national
education
association
can
run
that
very
same
phone
bank
with
totally
unregulated
money
today.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
your
honor,
we
have
briefed
this
matter,
and
after
due
consideration,
we
believe
that
this
statute
can
and
should
be
struck
down
consistent
with
the
buckley
line
of
cases.
because
it
does
go
too
far.
section
323(a)
the
national
party
prohibition
is
a
restriction
regardless
of
whether
the
amounts
are
coordinated
or
uncoordinated,
a
principle
from
the
buckley
cases.
whether
it's
individual
or
corporate
money,
whether
it
is...
whether
it
is
a
large
donation
or
a
small
donation,
any,
any
amount
of
money
that
the
national
parties
are
involved
with
that
is
not
subject
to
the
limitations,
prohibitions,
and
reporting
requirements
of
federal
law,
feca,
is
a
crime,
it
is
a--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--your
honor,
under...
under
strict
scrutiny,
which
we
believe
is
certainly
applicable
here,
because
this
is
not
a
contribution
limit--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
under
strict
scrutiny,
the
government
doesn't
even
argue
this
statute
can
pass
strict
scrutiny,
so
if
the
court,
as
we
submit
that
it
should,
since
these,
since
these
restrictions
go
to
the
very
essence
of
what
political
parties
do--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--and
in
fact,
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief,
we
believe
that
we
do
win
if
even
the
more
complacent
standard
is
applied.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
because
congress
has
to
make
an
effort,
justice
souter,
to
closely
draw
the
statute
to
address
the
ill
that
it
is
trying
to
address.
a
$100
donation
solicited
by
the
chairman
of
the
rnc
to
a
california
gubernatorial
candidate
is
not
prohibiting
that,
making
that
a
felony,
is
not
closely
drawn.
prohibiting
the
republican
national
committee
from,
from,
from
raising
money
consistent
with
the
state
law
in
virginia
and
donating
millions
of
dollars
in
2001
in
the
state
elections
in
virginia,
there's
no
federal
interest
in
that.
that's--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--there,
it
is,
it
shows
no
esteem
for
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
regulating
its
own
state
elections
to
tell
a
national
political
party
or
anyone
else
that
it
must
comply
with
federal
standards
in
order
to
participate
in
a
purely
state
election
activity
when
there
are
no
federal
candidates
on
the
ballot.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
exactly.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
the
statute
has
to
be
narrowly
tailored,
we
contend,
but
at
least
closely
drawn
to
pursue
the
federal
interest.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
and
here,
and
here--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--it
would,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--the...
the
national--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--the...
the
national
parties
are
constrained
by,
are
constrained
by
federal
statute
purportedly
pursuing
a
federal
interest
in,
in
their
activities
relating
to
a
federal,
to
a
state
and
local
election.
it
has
been
a
touchstone
of
the
campaign
finance
statute
since
the
tillman
act
in
1907
that
the
activity,
the
contribution
even,
has
to
be,
has
to
be
directed
to
influencing
or
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
or
directed
to
a
federal
election.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
this
is
the
first
time
congress
has
abandoned
that
touchstone.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
i
believe
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
your
honor.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
under
the
federalism,
under
our
federalism
argument,
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
as
well
as--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--well,
your
honor,
under
the
buckley
line
of
cases,
you
have
never
addressed
a
federalism
issue
before
because
the
currently,
the
currently
existing,
the
pre-existing
campaign
finance
statutes
were
by
their
terms
limited
to
contributions
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
a
federal
election.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
exactly.
it's
a
first
amendment
issue
if
the
federal
government
is
purporting
to
pursue
an
interest,
an
interest
that
isn't
a
legitimate
federal
interest.
your
honor,
if
i
may
say--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--connecticut.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
your
honor,
under
the
prior
regime,
the
republican
national
committee
had
12
separate
accounts
that
it
ran
that
were
in
compliance
with
the
various
permutations
of
state
law,
so
that
when
it
wanted
to
participate
in
connecticut,
for
example,
it
had
connecticut-compliant
money
to
do
so.
under
this
regime,
it
has
one
account,
and
one
account
only,
and
that
is
the
federal
account,
and
with
that,
when
that
account
contains
donations
that
are,
that
are
of
a
level
higher
than
the,
than
the
state
it
wants
to
participate
in,
there
is
a
problem.
now,
the
states
have
not
worked
their
way
through
that.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
right.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
you
would
be
striking
down
any
states.
we
have
argued
here
that
the,
the
problems
with
323a,
the
national
party
prohibition
is
that
it
is
an
across-the-board
criminal
prohibition
of
all
rnc
activity.
no...
unless
it's
regulated
by
federal
hard
money
contributions,
if
you
will,
no
state
in
the
union
has
such
a
broad,
has
such
a
broad
statute,
and
if,
if
they
did
we
would
be
in
court
the
next
day
challenging
it.
323(b),
the
restrictions
on
state
parties,
usurps
law
by
imposing
this
orwellian
definition
of
federal
election
activity
which
sweeps
in
virtually,
virtually
all
activities
of
the
state
parties
during
even
years,
subjects
it
to
a
federal
$10,000
limit
and
then
perhaps
most
invasively
imposes
the
homegrown
requirement
which
makes
it
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
for
states
to
transfer
money
among
themselves.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
they
have
indeed.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
your
honor,
i
would
be
happy
to
explain,
to
explain
to
you
what's
wrong
with
section
323(b)
if
that
is
what
i
understand
your
question
to
be.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
i
absolutely
do,
i
absolutely
do.
what
is
wrong
with
323(b)
in
the
first
amendment
realm
is
that
it
does
restrict
the
ability
of
state
and
local
parties,
as
well
as
national
parties
to
pool
their
resources.
there
was
a
question
earlier
about
whether
there's
ever
been,
whether
there's
ever
been
a
recognition
of
the
right
to
pool
resources.
absolutely.
in
buckley
at
pages
65
and
66,
the
right
to
join
together
for
the
advancement
of
beliefs
and
ideas,
quote,
is
diluted
if
it
does
not
include
the
right
to
pool
money
through
contributions
for
funds
are
often
essential
if
advocacy
is
to
be
truly
or
optimally
affected.
the
state
and
local
and
national
parties
annually
pool
their
resources
for
voter
mobilization
plans
to
get
their
voters
to
the
polls.
under
the
levin
amendment,
which
is
immensely
complicated,
under
the
levin
amendment,
the
committee
that
spends
the
money
has
to
raise
100
percent
of
it,
both
the
federal
component
and
the
non-federal
component.
under
the
levin
amendment,
it
is
illegal
for
the
national
parties
to
send
even
a
federal
dollar
to
a
state
or
local
party
in
order
to,
in
order
to
participate
in
a,
in
a
joint
get
out
the
vote
program
that
the
state
is
funding
in
part
with
levin.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
well,
your
honor,
bear
in
mind
that
the
levin
amendment
restricts
not
just
joe
wealthy's...
sending
joe
wealthy's
donation.
it
restricts
sending
joe
poor
person's
$10
donation
down
to
the
states.
it
restricts
sending
even
federal
money,
noncorrupting
federal
money
down
to
the
states.
in
that
sense,
it
certainly
goes
too
far.
but
i
would
also
say...
point
out
with
regard
to
the
levin
amendment,
mr.
tamraz,
who
has
made
his
appearance
in
these
briefs,
as
he
did
in
the
thompson
committee,
gave
$300,000
to
state
parties
in
1996.
and
that's
supposedly
the
reason
they
passed...
one
of
the
reasons
they
passed
this
statute.
he
can
give,
in
california,
$10,000
to
each
of
the
58
california
county
committees
and
$10,000
to
the
california
state
committee
for
a
total
of
$590,000
in
california.
and
that
is
wholly...
that
is
not
federal
money.
that
is
levin
money.
but
the
national
party
committees
cannot
transfer
even
down
$10
to
the
state
party
for
a
voter
mobilization
plan.
that
is
not...
i
would
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
that's
neither
narrowly
tailored
nor
closely
drawn,
not
even
rational.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
but
the
consequence
of
trying
to
make
the
local
parties
independent
of
each
other
is
that
those
58
california
parties
cannot
pool
their
resources
for
a
statewide
get
out
the
vote
program,
justice
breyer.
and
the
democratic
national
committee
on
that
side
of
the
aisle,
the
republican
national
committee
on
our
side
of
the
aisle
is
sitting
in
the
hallway.
and
that
is
a
fundamental
wedge
between
the
associational
rights,
political
parties
in
an
area
that
even
senator
mccain
admits
is
fundamental
to
the
democratic
process.
that
is...
if
i
may
just
for
a
moment
to
expound
upon
that.
for
that
reason
alone,
we
believe
that
strict
scrutiny
is
absolutely
essential
in
this
case,
and
the
government
confirms
that
they
cannot
pass
the
strict
scrutiny
bar.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
no,
your
honor.
if
the
state
committee
is
using
levin
money,
they
can
accept
no
transfers.
100
percent
of
their
money
for
that
program
must
be
homegrown.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
it
is
323...
and
pardon
me
because
the
statute
has--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--it's
(b)(2)(b)(iv),
and
323(b)(2)(c).
and
(b)(4)
and
323(b)(2)(b)(iv),
it
says
the
amounts
expended
or
disbursed
are
made
solely
from
the
funds
raised
by
the
state,
local
or
district
committee
which
makes
such
expenditure
or
disbursement
and
do
not
include
any
funds
provided
to
such
committee--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
and
congress
recognizes--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--your
honor,
senator
levin,
when
he
proposed
the
levin
amendments--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
so
long
as
the
local
parties
are
not
using
the
levin
amendment,
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
but
if
they
are
using
levin
money,
it's
a
crime.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
if
the
entire
political
process
at
the
state
level
is
subjected
to
the
hard
money
limits,
you're
right,
your
honor.
but
senator
levin,
on
the
day
he
introduced
the
levin
amendment,
said
that
the
statute
would
go
too
far.
it
would
go
too
far
as
written
without
the
levin
amendment
in
regulating,
quoting,
some
of
the
most
core
activities
that
state
and
local
parties
engage
in.
so
the
levin
amendment
is
not--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--well,
it
was
an
option--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--that
is
correct.
but
justice
stevens,
it
is
an
option
that
congress
understood
was
essential
to
the
vitality
of
the
statute.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
it's
not
an
option
for
the
national
party.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
exactly.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
323(a)
is
directed
to
the
national
parties.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
and
323(a),
as
we've
indicated,
is
an
across
the
board
criminal
ban
on
national
parties
accepting
any
money
that
is
not
strictly
regulated
by
feca.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
they
would
have
to
file
a
federal
committee,
engage
in
federal
reporting
and
comply
with
all
the
restrictions.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
your
honor,
if
the
only
word
in
323(a)
were
receive,
you
would
be
right.
but
i
respectfully...
i
respectfully
refer
you
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
prohibits
soliciting,
receiving,
transferring,
directing
or
spending,
and
congress
intended
meaning
to
those
other
verbs--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--you
can
solicit
for
gubernatorial
candidates,
you
can
solicit
for
state
parties,
you
can
collaborate
with
state
parties
in
spending
money
the
way
the
political
parties
have
done
heretofore
in
voter
mobilization
plans.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
well,
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
under
the
court's
contribution
to
candidate
lines
of
cases,
putting
aside
the
question
that
we're
talking
about
contributions
to
political
parties,
and
not
directly
to
candidates
here.
but
under
the
contribution
to
candidate
line
of
cases,
those
cases
do
not
involve
solicitation
of
contributions
to
others,
such
as
the
chairman
of
the
rnc's
ability
to
solicit
money
for
someone
running
in
the
california
recall
election
right
now.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
the
homegrown
requirement?
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
national
parties,
your
honor.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
may
i
answer
as
you
go?
with
regard
to
323(b),
the
statute
does
pervasively
regulate
state
parties
from
section
323(a)
on.
in
our
briefs,
we
set
forward
the
overbroad
definition,
the
orwellian
definition
of
federal
election
activity
which
is
fundamental
to
section
323(b).
i
don't
believe
you
can
solve
323(b)
without
going
to
the
very
core
of
the
statute.
with
regard
to
section
323(a)
and
setting
up
separate
accounts,
you've
described
the
situation
before
the
statute
was
formed.
now,
are
there
ways...
are
there
regulatory
ways
that
congress
could
have
gone
in
more
closely
or
more
narrowly
and
limited
the
ability
of
national
parties
to
spend
money
coming
out
of
those
non-federal
accounts,
those
12
non-federal
accounts?
perhaps,
but
that
isn't
what
congress
did
here,
justice
breyer.
congress
here
adopted
an
across
the
board
criminal
prohibition
on
national
political
party
involvement
with
any
money
that
is
not
regulated
by
the
federal
government.
and
that
we
contend
goes
too
far.
now,
as
to
the
other
overbreadths
of
the
statute,
i
would
simply
rely
upon
what
we've
set
forth
in
the
briefs.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
time
permitting,
i'd
like
to
make
three
brief
points.
the
first
is
section
323(a),
the
across-the-board
criminal
prohibition
on
national
parties
can
be
well
contrasted
with
section
323(e),
which
addresses
federal
officeholder
solicitation.
in
323(e)(1)(b),
there
is
a
specific
allowance
for
federal
officeholders
to
raise
non-federal
money
up
to
the
analogous
federal
limit
for
state
and
local
candidates.
there
is
no
similar
allowance
for
national
party
officials,
and
the
conclusion
that
all
of
my
clients
have
reached
is
that
national
party
officials
are
unable
to
raise
non-federal
money,
even
up
to
the
analogous
federal
limit
if
it
goes
into
a
state
party,
a
state
candidate's
campaign
account
because
that
account
is
not
regulated
by
federal
law.
number
two,
and
to
go
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
the
potential
effect
of
corruption,
the
potential
corruptive
effect
of
such
donations
is
minuscule,
nonexistent,
attenuated
at
best,
in
the
words
of
colorado
i.
the
$15.6
million,
by
the
way,
that
the
rnc
spent
in
state
and
local
election
activity
in
2001
was
30
percent
of
the
non-federal
money
the
party
raised
that
year,
30
percent.
it's
not
an
insubstantial
amount
in
any,
to
any
degree.
second
point,
with
regard
to
section
323(b),
which
is
the
restrictions
on
state
parties,
the
corruptive
potential
of
donations
to
state
and
local
parties
for
use
in
get
out
the
vote
activities
directed
to
state
and
local
candidate
elections
is
again
minuscule,
at
best
attenuated,
in
the
words
of
colorado
i.
but
that
activity,
if
it
says
go
to
the
polls
on
november
8th,
is
swept
within
the
definition
of
federal
election
activity.
the
california
parties
send
out
hundreds
of
different
mailings
every
year
throughout
their
states
urging
voters
to
go
to
the
polls
and
those
mailings
mention
only
state
and
local
candidates.
that
activity
is
swept
within
the
definition
of
federal
election
activity
and
is
now
federally
regulated
activity
and
that,
in
that
respect
323(b)
goes
well
beyond
a
congressional
interest
in
eliminating
corruption
of
federal
candidates
and
officeholders.
final
point,
and
that
is
with
regard
to
section
213.
the
only
illusion
to
that
was
with
regard
to
the
coordination
of
activities
among
the
national
parties
and,
and
the
candidates.
213
addresses
two
different
uses
of
federal
money,
hard
money.
it
puts
the
parties
to
a
single
unified
irrevocable
choice
to
make
coordinated
expenditures
under
the
statute,
section
441a(d)
or
their
constitutional
right
to
make
independent
expenditures
recognized
by
this
court
in
colorado
i.
the
government,
and
this
is
very
important,
the
government
has
never
advanced
any
anti-corruption
rationale
to
put
the
parties
to
that
choice.
the
only
rationale
we've
gotten
is
congress
can
condition
the
statutory
right
simply
because
it's
congress.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
using
hard
money
for
i
is
more
corrupting
or
is
corrupting
in
any
way
than
using
hard
money
for
the
other.
if
there
are
no
questions
by
the
court.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
thank
you.
