chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
today
we'll
break
for
lunch
and
reconvene
at
1:30
and
the
court
will
be
in
recess
from
today
until
the
first
monday
in
october
2003,
at
which
time
the
october
2002
term
of
the
court
will
be
adjourned
and
the
october
2003
term
of
the
court
will
begin
as
provided
by
statute.
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
the
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act
cases.
mr.
starr?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
starr.
mr.
burchfield,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
off-year,
you
mean
governor
elections
in
virginia
and
new
jersey
and
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
also
an
answer
to
that
general
line,
that
when
you're
talking
about
the
first
amendment,
administrative
considerations
ordinarily
are
not
good
enough.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
a
sense,
there
is
a
parallel
argument
there
that
buckley
says
what
are
the
interests
that
the
government
may
rely
on
in
restricting
speech,
and
it
says
there
are
appearance
of
corruption,
corruption,
and
so
in
a
way,
to
the
extent
that
the
government
gets
away
from
that
at
all
in
going
to
some
other
interests,
you
can
say
it's
a
federalist...
federalism
argument,
but
it's
also
a
first
amendment
argument
in
the
sense
that
if
those
exist,
if
those
interests
are
not
there,
then
it's
a
first
amendment
difficulty.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
burchfield.
general
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
sometime
in
your
argument,
would
you
cover
the
question
of
whether,
if
the
court
were
to
strike
down
323(a),
323(b)
could
survive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
reason
for
upholding
the
contribution
limits
restriction
was
because
of
the
corruption
or
appearance
of
corruption
between
the
contribution
and
the
candidate.
i
don't
think
buckley
supports
the
proposition
that
congress
can
willy-nilly
regulate
any
sort
of
contributions
in
connection
with
an
election
campaign.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
this
the
sort
of
thing
we
ordinarily
have,
i
can
see
in
the
tax
code,
but
ordinarily
we
don't
have
in
a
connection
with
the
first
amendment
some
very
debatable
thing
that
might
be
this,
might
be
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
talking
about
the
official
versus
individual
capacity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
colorado
i,
we
said
that
the
corruption
rationale
did
not
seem...
seemed
quite
attenuated
in
connection
with
the
parties.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
olson,
you
said
a
moment
ago,
referred
to
the
testimony
of
senators
rudman
and
simon
and
boren
about
you
know,
breakfasts,
lunches.
that
i
don't
believe
is
a
permissible
basis
for
a
restriction,
that
you
know,
we're
tired
of
having
to
go
to
these
breakfasts
and
lunches.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
olson.
mr.
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
his
testimony
that
others
thought
that,
or
that
he
thought
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
waxman,
wasn't
there
considerable
dearth
of
evidence
as
to
something
a
little
bit
different,
which
are
a
quid
pro
quo?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your,
your
response
to
justice
kennedy
suggests
that
the
parties
exist
by
the
leave
of
congress.
surely
that
isn't
the
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
a
moment
ago,
mr.
waxman,
that
the
ohio
republican
candidate
was
placed
thereby
the
republican
state
committee.
well,
what
if
a
state
has
a
primary?
i
mean,
if
a
state
has
a
primary,
it's
the
result
of
the
primary
election
that
places
them
on
the
ballot,
not
the
state
nomination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
mr.
starr,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
starr.
we'll
stand
at
recess
until
1:30.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
burchfield,
we'll
hear
your
rebuttal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
burchfield.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
abrams,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
nrwc--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
the
defendant's
evidence,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
abrams.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
could
seek
them
but
they
wouldn't
be
very
successful.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
volume,
are
you
saying?
v-o-l-u-m-e?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
the
say
justice
souter
pronounces
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
of
the
themes
of
buckley
was
it's
not
up
to
the
government
to
decide
there
is
too
much
speech
coming
from
one
place
and
not
enough
coming
from
another.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
mr.
sekulow,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
sense,
the
problem
diminishes
with
the
age.
there
aren't
a
great
number
of
8
year
olds
making
contributions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sekulow.
mr.
clement,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
one
of
the...
one
of
the
dubious
things
about
austin
is
one
of
the
things
it
relied
on
was
the
fact
that
the
corporation's
members
or
did
not...
or
owners
did
not
necessarily
represent
a
large
amount
of
public
opinion,
and
it
seemed
to
me,
i
voted
in
the
majority,
but
it
seemed
to
me
since
then
that
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
to
allow
people
who
perhaps
don't
have
much
in
the
way
of
public
opinion
try
to
change
public
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--did
anyone
else
join
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
that
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
other
people
join
his
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
any
mention
of
the
candidate
makes
it
a
candidate
ad
and
not
an
issue
ad.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
of
the
briefs
argues
that
frequently
these
issues
are
before
congress
almost
at
the
same
time
the
election
comes
up,
because
the
congress
is
catching
up
perhaps
on
things
that
it
didn't
do
earlier
in
the
session.
and
so
it's
not
the
corporation's
voluntary
choice
to
put
it
up
there.
that's
the
time
it
has
to
do
it,
if
it's
going
to
do
any
good.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
wasn't
challenged,
though.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
were...
you
were
going
to
explain
why
this
difference
exists,
and
i
don't
think
you've
done
that
yet.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what,
what
about
say
the
national
rifle
association?
it's
against
gun
laws.
a
media
corporation
is
very
much
in
favor
of
gun
laws,
it
prints
editorials,
perhaps
it
even
slants,
god
forbid,
its
coverage
of
the
subject.
there
is
a
substantial
difference,
substantial
similarity
there,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
there
are
differences
with
respect
to
the
broadcast
media.
you
are
not
relying
on
the
scarcity
of
wavelengths,
are
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
the
scarcity
rationale?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
we'll
hear
from
you,
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you,
what
did
the
district
court
do
in
this
case?
didn't
they
strike
down
the
primary
definition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
district
court
pretty
well
disbelieve
the
buying
time
study?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
is
that
the
way
that
we
would
ordinarily
construe
a
statute.
to
say,
you
know,
if
this
bothers
you
or
affects
you,
come
in
and
we'll
make
an
exception
for
you?
that's
usually
the
legislative
prerogative.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
getting
it
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
congress
chose
this
course.
congress
said
a
three
judge
district
court
immediately
appealed
to
the
supreme
court,
and
22
issues.
i
mean,
it's
not
our
fault.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
all
300
pages
of
them
in
no.
02-1674
mcconnell
versus
federal
election
commission
in
eleven
companion
cases.
the
plaintiffs
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
numerous
provisions
of
the
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act
of
2002.
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
district
court
held
some
provisions
of
the
act
unconstitutional
and
upheld
others.
after
noting
probable
jurisdiction,
we
expedited
the
argument
and
decision
of
the
cases.
because
the
cases
present
so
many
issues,
we
have
prepared
three
separate
court
opinions
to
explain
our
disposition.
given
the
length
of
those
opinions,
my
oral
announcement
will
contain
only
an
abbreviated
outline
of
what
we
have
decided.
in
brief,
the
court
has
concluded
that
with
two
relatively
minor
exceptions,
the
entire
statute
is
constitutional.
those
two
exceptions
are
section
213
which
requires
political
parties
to
choose
between
making
coordinated
or
independent
expenditures
for
their
nominees,
and
section
318
which
prohibits
minors
from
making
contributions
to
political
candidates
or
parties.
the
first
of
the
three
court
opinions
has
two
authors,
justice
stevens
and
justice
o’connor.
it
covers
titles
i
and
ii
of
the
act.
i
have
authored
the
second
court
opinion
discussing
titles
iii
and
iv,
and
justice
breyer's
opinion
for
the
court
covers
title
v.
title
i
of
the
act
restricts
the
use
of
soft
money
that
is
money
raised
outside
the
source
and
amount
limitations
established
by
the
federal
campaign
act
to
fund
the
activities
that
influence
federal
elections.
title
i's
central
provision
numbered
section
323(a)
in
the
amended
version
of
the
federal
election
campaign
act
prohibits
national
political
parties
and
their
agents
from
soliciting,
receiving,
directing,
or
spending
soft
money.
the
joint
opinion
concludes
that
this
prohibition
is
an
appropriate
response
to
congress’
legitimate
concerns
with
preventing
the
actual
and
apparent
corruption
threatened
by
large
soft
money
contributions
and
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
federal
election
process.
the
joint
opinion
upholds
both
this
provision
and
the
remaining
provisions
of
title
i,
which
as
the
court
can
excuse
them,
largely
enforced
section
323(a)
by
preventing
state
parties
form
using
soft
money
to
fund
the
activities
that
influence
federal
election
prohibiting
both
national
and
state
parties
from
soliciting
and
donating
soft
money
to
tax-exempt
organizations
that
engage
in
federal
election
activity
and
regulating
federal
and
state
candidates
and
office
holder’s
use
of
soft
money
in
connection
with
certain
election-related
activities.
title
ii
of
the
bcra
primarily
regulates
the
funding
of
electioneering
communications
that
is
communications
that
are
intended
to
or
have
the
effect
of
influencing
the
outcome
of
federal
election.
the
joint
opinion
upholds
the
act’s
primary
definition
of
electioneering
communications
as
it
applies
both
in
the
context
of
the
disclosure
provision
set
forth
in
section
201
of
the
act
and
in
the
context
of
section
203
which
prohibits
corporations
and
labor
unions
from
using
general
treasury
funds
to
finance
such
communications.
section
204
extends
this
prohibition
to
non-profit
corporations.
the
joint
opinion
construes
section
204
to
exempt
the
subcategory
of
non-profits
described
in
our
decision
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
commonly
called
mcfl
organization,
and
upholds
it
as
so
construed.
title
ii
also
contains
a
number
of
provisions
regulating
independent
and
coordinative
expenditures
in
connection
with
political
campaigns.
the
joint
opinion
upholds
sections
204
and
214
which
provide
that
expenditures
coordinated
with
political
parties
are
treated
as
contributions
to
those
parties,
but
find
constitutional
infirmities
in
section
213
which
requires
political
parties
to
choose
between
making
unlimited
independent
expenditures
or
a
limited
coordinated
expenditures
in
support
of
their
nominees.
title
iii
and
iv
contains
several
amendments
to
the
federal
election
campaign
act,
the
communications
act,
and
other
provisions
of
the
united
states
code.
in
my
opinion
for
the
court,
we
conclude
that
several
of
the
plaintiffs'
challenges
to
this
provision
including
section
305
pertaining
to
so-called
attack
ads
are
not
justiciable.
we
do
uphold
however,
section
311
of
the
act
which
requires
that
electioneering
communications
clearly
identify
either
the
candidate
who
authorized
them
or
if
they
have
not
been
so
authorized,
the
individual
who
sponsored
them
without
the
candidate’s
authorization.
on
the
other
hand,
we
strike
down
section
318
which
prohibits
minors
from
making
contributions
to
candidates
or
political
parties
as
an
unconstitutional
abridgment
of
minors’
first
amendment
rights.
finally,
in
the
third
court
opinion
written
by
justice
breyer
we
uphold
the
sole
provision
of
title
v
at
issue
in
this
case.
section
504
which
requires
broadcasters
to
keep
publicly
available
records
of
requests
to
purchase
broadcast
time
for
politically
related
communication.
there
are
several
separate
opinions.
i
have
written
a
dissent
with
respect
to
titles
i
and
v
which
justices
scalia
and

i
have

its
entirety
and
