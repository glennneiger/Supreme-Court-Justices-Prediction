mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
we
believe
it
could,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
let
me
come
back
to
that.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
the
court
considers
today,
every
single
one
of
them
in
connection
with
title
i,
are
not
new.
for
a
century,
with
the
overwhelming
support
of
the
public,
congress
has
struggled
to
curb
the
corrupting
influence
of
corporate,
union
and
large,
unregulated
contributions
in
federal
elections.
time
and
time
again,
this
court
has
agreed
that
achievement
of
that
goal
is
critical
to
avoid
erosion
of
public
confidence
in
representative
government
to...
and
i'm
using
the
court's
words...
to
a
disastrous
extent.
but
concentrated
wealth
is
nothing
if
not
creative.
as
this
court
has
observed,
the
history
of
campaign
finance
reform
has
been
a
cycle
of
legislation
followed
by
the
invention
and
exploitation
of
loopholes,
followed
by
more
legislation
to
cut
off
the
most
egregious
evasions
and
circumventions.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
this
court
hasn't
found
every
problem
to
be
solvable.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
of
course
not.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
of
course,
justice
scalia.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
of
course
it
is.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
of
course
it
is.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
of
course
it
is,
but
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again,
not
only
is
it
a
critical
problem
that's
fundamental
to
the
integrity
of
our
election
system,
but
that
the
solutions
that
the
legislature
has
enacted
before,
the
central
principles
of
which
are
embodied
in
bcra,
are
constitutional
solutions
to
that
problem.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
congress
has
done
is
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
from
1976,
and
including
the
earlier
decisions,
that
specifically
said
and
have
said
over
and
over
again,
that
the
regulations
of
contributions,
contributions
where
you're
talking
about
contributions,
not
expenditures.
this
court
has
said
the
regulations
of
contributions
to
the
federal
election
process
by
unions
and
by
corporations
may
be
controlled
by
congress
in
federal
legislation,
in
connection
with
federal
elections.
this
court
has
said
that
over
and
over
again.
and
this
court
said
in
buckley--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--this
law,
referring
to
title
i,
makes
certain
contributions
illegal
to
the
federal...
to
the
national
parties
and
to
their
conduits
and
surrogates.
contributions
from
unions,
corporations
in
excess
of
certain
limits.
of
course
it
says
that
once
it
said
that
the
contribution
is
illegal,
the
solicitation
of
the
contribution
is
comparably
illegal.
and
the
expenditure
of
that
contribution,
not
any
amount
of
money
that
the
federal
or
state
committees
might
want
to
spend,
but
the
use
of
that
money
from
that
source
in
excess
of
those
limits.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
of
course
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again,
that
congress
can
regulate
contributions
from
corporations...
the
treasuries
of
corporations
and
unions.
separate
segregated
funds
still
exist
so
that
those
contributions
from
members
can
be
made,
and
that
congress
can
regulate
the
amount
of
those
contributions.
that's
all
that
title
i
of
bcra
does.
and
that's...
all
three
of
those
aspects
were
addressed
by
this
court
in
buckley
and
have
been
addressed
again
and
again
and
again.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in
fact,
buckley
did
regulate
the
amount
of
the
contributions
by
corporations
and
unions
and
in
excess
of
certain
levels
to
parties
as
well.
there
was
not
only
a
1,000
contribution
limit
to
the
candidate,
but
there
were
limitations
in
buckley
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
expenditures
that
an
individual
might
make
in
consultation
or
coordination
with
a
candidate
and
there
were
aggregate
limits
with
respect
to
the
$25,000
limit
that
was
set
for
the
precise
reason,
this
court
explained,
to
avoid
circumvention
of
the
limits
in
connection
with
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
justice
scalia.
the
aggregate
contribution
by
parties
and
the
court
talked
in
terms
of
the
aggregate
contributions
that
could
be
made
all
together
by
the
individual,
and
the
court
specifically
talked
about
that,
that
$25,000
limit
was
for
the
very
purpose
of
preventing
the
individual
to
circumvent
the
contribution
limit
to
a
candidate
by
giving
money
to
the
party
which
would
then
be
given
to
the
same
candidate,
and
the
court
specifically
said
in
buckley
that
that
would
be
unearmarked
money
that
would
go
to
the
party,
which
would
then
go
to
the
candidate.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
a
contribution,
justice
kennedy.
i
don't
think
i
understand
the
question,
because
the
court
specifically
talked
in
terms
of
the
corrupting
influence
of
corporate
union
and
uncontrolled
large
money
contributions
and
what
this
court
said
then
and
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
congress
can
attempt
to
avoid
circumvention
of
those
permissible
limits.
now,
mr.
starr
spoke
a
moment
ago
about
the
lavish
evidence
of
abuses
that
were
set
out
and
reported
in
the
thompson
report.
among
those
evidence
of
abuses
is
that
enormous
amounts
of
so-called
soft
money,
which
is
just
another
way
of
saying
money
that
is
prohibited
to
go
to
federal
elections,
was
going
to
federal
elections
through
various
surrogates,
through
the
national
party.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
evidence--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
the
evidence,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
is
that
the
money
was
going
from,
through
the
national
parties
and
at
the
direction
of
the
national
parties
to
the
state
subordinate
committees
in
order
to
fund
various
activities
that
had
to
do
with
federal
elections,
and
that's
what,
they
were--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
that
was
not
what
congress
was
concerned
about.
congress
was
concerned--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the...
the
ban...
no.
in
the
sense
that
the
state
parties
can
raise
un...
money
that's
not
regulated,
provided
that
it's
not
used
in
conjunction
with
federal
election
activity.
so
in
that
sense,
the
states
are
free
to
continue
to
do
that
and
spend
all
they
wish.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
is,
it
is
broadly
defined,
but
it
has
been
defined
by
the
experts
in
this
country
on
elections,
the
corruption
of
big
money,
the
regulation
and
the
potential
abuses.
this
court
has
previous
said
over
and
over
again,
this
is
an
area
where
there
is
special
expertise
in
congress.
this
legislation--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
incumbents
were
doing
very
well
under
the
existing
system,
98.5
percent
of
the
members
of
congress,
the
congressional,
the
house
of
representatives
that
ran
for
re-election
in
2002
were
re-elected.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
apparently
not.
the
evidence
also
shows
that's
in
the
record--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
evidence
is
that
the
can...
the
candidates--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
the
answer
to--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--justice
scalia--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--let
me...
let
me...
there
are
several
answers
to
that.
one,
this
court's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
are
several
answers
to
that
question.
first
of
all,
that
very
issue
was
addressed
in
1976
in
buckley
and
the
court
said
that
the
rules
are
applying
equally
to
anybody
running
for
office,
and
in
that
circumstance,
the
court
will
look
to
evidence
of
invidious
discrimination
against
challengers.
there
is
no
evidence
of
invidious
discrimination
against
challengers.
number
two,
the
evidence
supports
overwhelmingly
that
incumbents
were
able
to
get
re-elected
under
the
old
system
just
fine
and
that
overwhelming
amount
of
evidence
is
not
in
the
record,
in
the
testimony
below,
which
is
summarized
in,
in
various
different
sources
that
the
repeated
testimony
by
senator
thompson,
senator
mccain,
former
senator
simon
and
over
and
over
again
abuses
in
the
system
that
were
not
benefiting
incumbents
but
were
tearing
down
faith
of
the
american
people
in
a
system
of
government
and
making
people
believe
that
the
more
money
that
you
put
in,
to
use
the
words
of
one
individual,
the
white
house
is
like
a
subway.
you
have
to
put
money
in
the
turnstiles.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
justice
scalia,
the
evidence
shows
and
the
federal
election
commission
came
out
with
a
report
earlier
that
year
that
candidates
are
raising
more
money
this
year.
it's
not
the
amount
of
money,
but
it's
the
source
of
money
from
potential
corrupting
influences
and
that
the
hard
money,
in
fact,
has
benefits
to
the
party
and
to
the
candidates.
the
statistics
showed
that
in,
$500
million
was
raised
in
the
year
2000
for
soft,
so-called
soft
money.
again,
that's
a
euphemism
for
money
that's
going
around
the
system.
that,
that
was
42
percent
of
the
amount
of
money
that
the
national
party
spent
on
election
activities,
up
from
9
percent
in
1984,
42
percent.
of
that
$500
million,
60
percent
came
from
just
800
donors.
in
that
year,
the
top
50
donors
each
gave
between
950,000
and
$6
million
a
piece.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
have
a
breakdown
of
that,
justice
breyer,
but
what
the
evidence
does
show,
if
you
go
back
election
by
election,
every
two
years,
that
incumbents
under
the
old
system,
if
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
decided
to
stand
for
re-election,
the
statistics
year
after
year
are
the
same,
97
to
98
to
98.5
percent
of
the
incumbents
were
winning
re-election.
so
to
the
extent
that
congress
would
devise
this
scheme--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
no,
justice
scalia.
but
it
directly
addresses
the
question
that
you
raised
to
the
extent
that
congress
was
looking
for
a
scheme
to
protect
incumbencies,
they
were
doing
very
well.
it
would
be
hard
to
develop
a
scheme
that
could
be
better
for
incumbents.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the...
that's,
well,
justice
stevens,
that's
a
reason
for
deferring
to
them.
the
evidence,
as
mr.
starr
put,
was
lavish,
that
the
abuses
were
enormous,
and
that
members
of
congress
were
spending--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
is...
the
evidence--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--of
course,
of
course--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
this
court
said
in
buckley,
in
shrink
missouri
government,
in
every
one
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
considered
is
that
those
are
indeed
abuses
that
those
are
corrupting
influences,
and
the
word
abuse
was
justice
starr's
practically,
justice
starr's
first
word,
i
mean
general
starr's
first
word
out
of
his
mouth.
that
is
everybody's
word
when
it
comes
to
the
system.
i
guess
you'll
have
to
wait.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
was
everybody's
word
when
they
described
this
system,
when
you
talk
about
the
enormous
amount
of
money
that
was
avoiding
the
direct
regulatory
scheme
and
going
through
various
surrogates
to
accomplish
the
same
thing.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
acting
in
his
capacity,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
on
behalf
of
the
national
committee.
acting
as
an
individual
that
wouldn't
be
the
case,
but
when
he
is
speaking
in
terms
of
the
party,
that
was
the
case.
the,
what
congress
was
attempting
to
do
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
an
individual--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's...
i'm
speaking
now,
justice
scalia,
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
itself.
it
talks
in
terms
of
his
capacity
as
a
member
of
the
chairman
of
the
party.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
an
individual
might
do
something
separately,
and
that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
suppose
that
would
be
up
to
some
level
of
reasonable
prosecution,
prosecutorial
discretion.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it's
actually
relatively
clear,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
regular...
not
only
are
the,
is
the
statute
relatively
clear
and
not
only
does
the
statute
specifically
address
the
abuses
that
were
well-documented
and
their
evasions.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
that,
that,
probably
that
language
wouldn't
even
had
to
have
been
in
the
statute,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
presume
that
would
be
presupposed
that
agents
of
the
national
party
acting
on
behalf
of
the
national
party
can't
do
the
things
that
the
national
party
can
do.
organizations
subject
to
the
control
of
the
national
party
can't
do
the
same
things
that
the
national
party
can
do.
that
indeed
is
the
same
sort
of
legislation
that
this
court
has
considered
before.
let
me...
on
this
subject--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there,
there
are
indeed
some
of
those
areas
where
there
are
refinements
because
congress
was
concerned
with
the...
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
political
parties
are,
have
special
advantages.
colorado
ii
talks
about
that,
that
there
are
special
rights
and
special
privileges,
and
so
congress
was
concerned
with
the
immense
possibility,
the
immense
power
of
national
political
parties
to
engage
in
abuses.
so
congress
was
particularly
concerned
and
with
abundant
record
of
the
use
of
money
going
to
the
national
parties
to
circumvent
these
things.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it's
entirely
possible
that
congress
has
not
solved
every
potential
abuse
of
federal
election
law
and
that
the
lawyers
will
be
back
before
this
court
with
another
piece
of
legislation.
congress
did
not
have
before
it
evidence
of
abuse
of
that
nature,
justice
scalia.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
made
some,
in
my
judgment,
perfectly
understandable
exceptions
for
individuals
acting
in
their
own
capacity
or
individuals
engaging
in
certain
things,
as
opposed
to
the
massive
power
of
the
party.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
challenge
was
the
equal
protection
clause
was
considered
in
buckley.
i
see
no
evidence
of
any
invidious
discrimination.
i
guess
we
would
be
concerned.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
very
serious
concern,
justice
kennedy,
but
there
is
not
any
evidence
of
invidious
discrimination,
to
use
the
language
of
this
court
in
buckley.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
court
has
addressed
that
very
concern
starting
with
buckley
up
through
colorado
i
and
ii.
the
fact
that
the
party
may
be
used
as
a
conduit
for
circumvention
of
the
limits
on
contributions
to
candidates.
and
let
me
add
that
the
republican
national
committee,
in
their
brief
below,
said
that
the
republican
party
is
a
single
unitary
organization.
this
is
at
page
23
of
the
rnc
opposition
brief
in
the
court
below.
the
republican
party
is
a
single
unitary
organization
that
comprises
various
interrelated
parts.
the
rnc,
state
and
local
parties,
the
rnc's
165
members,
candidates
identifying
themselves
as
republicans
and
so
forth.
and
mr.
burchfield,
when
he
testified
on
april
5,
2000
before
the
committee
on
rules
and
administration
of
the
united
states
senate,
said,
legislative
proposals
to
ban
party
receipt
of
soft
money
also
cannot
seek
to
impose
restrictions
on
state
parties...
also
must
seek
to
impose
restrictions
on
state
parties
as
well.
they
cannot
be
effective
otherwise.
that's
exactly
what
the
understanding
that
congress
had
when
it
addressed
this
statute.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
distinction
was
made
by
this
court
in
buckley
and
in
the
subsequent
decisions
that
there
is
a
higher
level
of
scrutiny
and
a
greater
level
of
concern
with
respect
to
the
amount
being
given
to
an
individual
and
a
greater
identity
and
potential
for
abuse,
because
that
money
can
then
be
spent
either
directly
by
the
individual
or
in
coordination
with
the
political
party
on
the
individual's
reelection,
if
individuals
go
out
and
affiliate
with
this
group
or
that
group
and
spend
the
money.
that's
not
subject
to
the
same
kind
of
level
of
control
by
the
party
or
the
candidates
and
it
is
looked
at--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--congress
didn't
pick
on
a
party,
justice
scalia.
congress
focused
on
the
fact
that
the
parties
control,
as
in
the
words
of
the
segment
from
the
brief
that
i
quoted,
the
party
and
the
candidates
are,
in
one
extent,
one
and
the
same.
secondly,
the
parties
are
given
considerable
privileges,
the
power
to
put
candidates
on
the
ballot.
there
is
reasons
that
the
exercise
of
this
enormous
power
can
be
subject
to
greater
restrictions.
congress
wasn't
picking
on
parties.
congress
was,
one,
looking
at
where
the
greatest
abuses
were.
and
then
number
two,
following
the
guidelines
set
by
this
court.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
with
respect
to
independent
expenditures,
the
court
said
that.
and
then
the
court
addressed
the
coordinated
expenditures
and
approached
it
in
quite
a
different
way,
and
held
that
coordinated
expenditures
in
colorado
ii
could
be
treated
just
like
contributions.
and
the
difference
is
that
the
court
has
held,
quite
understandably,
that
the
level
of
concern
that
congress
might
have
over
abuses
from
contributions
is
greater,
and
the
level
of
first
amendment
concern
is
more
attenuated
because
that
contribution
may
be
used
in
a
different
way,
depending
upon
the
contributions.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in
the
first
place--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
is
the
same
proposition
that
is
discussed
in
buckley
in
connection
with
the
aggregate
contribution
limit,
and
is
discussed
several
times
in
the
cases
that
come
along
since
buckley.
the
party
is
a
different
entity.
the
nra
or
any
other
of
the
many
organizations
that
might
spend
their
money
for
this
in
a
way
that
the
candidate
cannot
control
would
not
be
focused
in
the
same
way.
this
court
provides
the
guidance
that
says
that
the
parties,
because
they're
so
closely
identified
with
the
individuals,
and
such
a
source
of
potential
circumvention,
are
something
that
the
congress
may
legitimately
be
concerned
with.
and
this
legislation
was
developed
as
a
result
of
six
years
of
intense
investigation,
debate,
testimony,
delicate
compromises,
all
conducted
in
the
context
of
congressional
elections
and
a
presidential
election.
this
was
a
product
of
a
lot
of
time
by
the
people
who,
over
and
over
again,
talked
about
the
level
that
abuses
had
come
to.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
we
pass
laws
in
the
united
states,
justice
scalia,
by
people
who
already
hold
office.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
is
that
congressional
judgments...
and
i
can
only
quote
the
language
of
this
court
in
buckley.
congress
could
legitimately
conclude,
speaking
in
terms
of
potential
for
corruption.
in
the
nrwc
case
in
1982,
a
unanimous
court
said
that
careful
legislative
adjustment
of
federal
electoral
law
in
a
cautious,
advanced,
step-by-step,
warrants
considerable
deference.
we
accept...
this
is
a
unanimous
court...
congress's
judgment
that
it
is
the
potential
for
such
influence
that
demands
regulation,
nor
will
we
second
guess
a
legislative
determination
as
to
the
need
for
prophylactic
measures
where
corruption
is
the
evil
feared.
if
the
court
were
to
look
at
the
long
series
of
the
summary
of
abuses
in
judge
kollar-kotelly's
decision
below,
and
to
look
at
the
testimony
given
by
former
senators
rudman
and
simon
and
boren
and
the
other
individuals
who
describe
what
it's
like,
the
breakfasts,
the
lunches,
the
receptions,
the
dinners,
the
endless
cycle
of
campaign
finance.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
justice
scalia,
the
parties
and
the
candidates
can
spend
all
of
the
hard
money
they
want
on
attack
ads
or
any
other
types
of
ads.
congress
was
focusing
there,
with
respect
to
specific
types
of
legislation,
in
connection
with
the
use
of
state
money,
soft
money
that
comes
to
the
state
parties,
in
conjunction
with
elections
taking
place
at
which
federal
officials
are
on
the
ballot.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
these
numbers
were
saying
it
was
too
much
work.
what
they
were
saying
is
that
the
relentless
pursuit
of
big
contributions
was
innervating
to
the
political
process.
the
record--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
potential
for
indebtedness,
the
feeling
of
indebtedness,
the
selling
of
access.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
of
course
it
is
a--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--of
course
it
is
a
valid
interest,
justice
stevens,
but
what
all
of
these
individuals
were
talking
about
was
the
appearance
and
the
actuality
that
the
system
had
been
corrupted.
the
access--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--of
course
there
is,
justice
kennedy,
but
the
first
amendment
considerations
as
articulated
by
this
court
address
the
infusion
of
money
from
particular
sources,
either
from
wealthy
individuals
or
a
corporation...
corporate
treasuries
or
unions
differently.
and
what
all
of
this
testimony
was
about
wasn't
how
much
time
it
took,
was
that
money
had
become
the
number
one
operative
driving
force,
not
only
in
the
running
for
office,
but
for
the
entire
period
that
the
individual
was
in
office.
and
that
the
political
parties...
and
the
evidence
was
abundant,
lavish...
that
the
political
parties
themselves
were
saying
if
you
give
this
amount
of
soft
money,
we
will
set
up
meetings
with
these
members
of
congress
or
these
leaders
of
the
party
or
this
opportunity
to
spend
a
night
in
the
white
house
or
whatever.
the
actual
access
which
is
how
things
get
done
in
congress
was
something...
was
not
only
for
sale,
but
also
perceived
to
be
for
sale.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
there
is
two
answers
to
that.
the
contribution
limits
have
been
increased.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
what
this
court
has
said
in
buckley,
and
has
also
said
over
and
over
again
is
to
the
extent
that
the
candidates
and
the
parties
have
to
reach
out
to
more
individuals
for
more
participation
rather
than
relying
on
this
800
or
so
individuals
that
give
large
amounts
of
money.
that's
better
for
the
candidates
and
it's
better
for
the
parties
and
it's
better
for
the
political
process.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what...
what
i'm,
what
i'm
saying,
justice
scalia,
is
what
this
court
has
said,
that
to
the
extent
that
a
larger
numbers
of
smaller
contributors,
that
you
don't
need
to
spend
all
this
much
time
courting
is
a
better
process
for
the
political
system.
that's
what
this
court
said,
and
that's
what
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the,
the
legislation
refers
to
money
that
is
spent
in
federal
election
activity.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
starting
in
the
19th
century
that
the
control,
the
regulation
of
federal
elections
is
quintessentially
important
to
what
congress
does.
what
congress
had
abundant
evidence
that
this
money,
that,
that
the
individuals,
my
opponents
are
talking
about
having
to
do
with
state
elections
were
when
federal
candidates
were
on
the
ballot
and
money
was
being
used
ostensibly
for
neutral
purposes,
but
for
the
primary
purpose
of
bringing
out
voters
to
vote
in
a
federal
election
and
to
influence
the
outcome
of
that
election.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
the
state
party
can
spend
unlimited
amounts
of
money
that's,
that's
in
connection
with
an
election.
congress
reasonably
found
that
where
there
is
a
federal
official
on
the
ballot,
that
money
spent
in
that
election--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
to
the
extent
that
under
some
circumstances,
there
is...
it's
inconceivable
to
establish--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
i'm
suggesting
that
where
this
money
has
been
spent
in
the
past
and
as
defined
by
congress
in
section
323(b),
federal
election
activity
is
relatively
clearly
defined.
it's
in
connection
with...
justice--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
correct.
and
this
court
has
said
again
and
again
to
the
extent
that
there's
an
overbreadth
challenged
in
the
context
of
a
facial
attack
on
a
statute,
the
statute
must
be
substantially
overbroad.
there
may
be
particular
as-applied
challenges
to
particular
aspects
of
this
legislation.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
justice
scalia,
what
the...
what
congress
was
looking
at
is
that
the
huge
amounts
of
money
being
used
at
the
time
of
elections
where
federal
candidates
were
on
the
ballot,
political
parties,
and
whether
they
be
state
parties
or
national
parties
are
going,
are
not
going
to
pour
enormous
amounts
of
resources
into
elections
at
which
there
is
not
much
of
a
context,
a
contest.
state
parties
can
spend
all
of
the
federal,
the
hard
money
they
want
with
respect
to
those
activities
and
then
the
levin
amendment,
which
was
not
required
by
the
constitution,
not
necessary,
but
that
gave
an
additional
ability
of
the
state
to
use
under
certain
circumstances
soft
money,
unregulated
by
the
federal
government
in
those
contexts.
the
bottom,
at
the
bottom,
what
this
legislation
does
is
treat
the
very
same
abuses
that
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
and
has
said
repeatedly
are
the
types
of
concerns
that
are
legitimate
for
congress
to
be
concerned
about
and
to
use
the
words
of
this
court,
go
to
the
very
fundamental
integrity
of
our
government.
the
only
thing
in
title
i
that
congress
did
was
to
control
the
source
of
contributions,
unions
and
corporate
treasuries,
and
the
amounts
above
a
certain
amount,
and
a
potential
circumventions
of
those
limits.
all
three
of
those
things
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
are
constitutional,
appropriate,
and
necessary
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
federal
electorate
process.
thank
you.
