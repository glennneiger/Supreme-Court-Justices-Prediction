justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think...
i
think
the
question
that
justice
ginsburg
is
getting
at
is,
i
gathered
the
statute
was
passed
because,
let's
call
him
joe
wealthy,
wants
to
write
a
check
for
$10
million
to
help
his
favorite
candidate
smith
get
elected.
and
they
figured
out
a
way,
who
they
is
is
named
in
the
lower
court
opinion,
but
we'll
just
say
they.
they
figured
out
a
way
despite
the
prior
law
to
do
it.
it
would
pay
for
get
out
the
vote,
it
would
pay
for
voter
registration,
and
it
would
pay
for
issue
ads
which
didn't
say
vote
for
smith.
what
they
said
was
jones,
his
opponent,
is
a
real
rat,
go
tell
him
what
you
think
of
him,
okay.
i
mean,
all
right,
now,
that
was
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
two,
the
state
is
home
free,
does
anything
it
wants
where
there
are
only
state
candidates
on
the
ballot,
that
where
there
are
state
and
federal
both
on
the
ballot,
we
will
allocate,
and
then
it
sets
up
a
highly
complex
system
of
allocation,
so
i
think
the
question
that
i
heard
was,
if
you
thought
the
prior
system
of
allocation
which
happened
to
be
60
percent
fed,
40
percent
state
or
a
ratio
for
the
state
committee,
depending
on
the
number
of
state
offices
versus
federal
offices.
if
you
felt
that
was
constitutional,
then
why
is
this
new
allocation
unconstitutional,
because
as
i
read
through
it,
it
looked
like
the
basic
problem
is
when
you
get
a
voter
to
the
polls,
you
have
to
have
him
there
to
vote
for
a
state
candidate,
you
have
to
have
him
there
for
a
federal
candidate,
and
we
are
going
to
allocate
the
cost
of
getting
him
there
between
hard
money,
levin
money
and
maybe
some
other
money.
all
right.
that's
a
long
question,
but
i
want
its
addressing
specifically
what
justice
ginsburg
raised,
which
is
why
if
that
first
allocation
is
okay,
why
isn't
this
new
allocation
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
$10,000,000
and
get
out
the
vote--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
we'll
see
how
that
works
because
the
second
they
start
conferring
with
any
candidate
or
they
start
conferring
with
the
political
party,
they're
going
to
be
in
a
lot
of
trouble.
so
i
guess
it
still
is
possible
that
a
person
could
have
a
totally
uncoordinated
private
effort
to
get
out
the
vote
and
give
a
lot
of
money
to
it.
but
the
general
rule
of
constitutional
law
and
every
other
law
is
congress
doesn't
have
to
solve
every
problem.
and
we
don't
know
yet
whether
that
will
turn
out
to
be
a
big
loophole.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
that
i
take
it
that
(a)
says
that
all
money
spent
by
a
national
committee
is
hard
money
is
because
congress
is
interested
in
the
contribution,
not
the
expenditure.
and
what
they're
saying
is
if
you
write
a
check
for
one
penny
or
you
write
a
check
for
50
billion
to
the
republican
or
democratic
national
committee,
we
assume
that
that
money
is
going
to
be
used
to
affect
federal
elections.
now,
you
are
right
that
a
small
portion
is,
in
fact,
used
just
for
state.
a
portion.
9
million
out
of
300
million,
something
like
that.
but
it's
simply
too
hard
for
us
to
know,
contribution
by
contribution,
what's
going
to
do
what.
and
the
only
workable
rule
here
is
not
to
prevent
the
rnc
from
using
its
money
on
state
elections,
but
to
say
to
the
rnc,
every
penny
that
you
spend
because
you're
a
national
committee
must
follow
federal
source
and
amount
limitations.
so
it's
an
administrative
reason,
it
focuses
on
the
contribution,
and
it
focuses
on
the
nature
of
a
national
political
committee.
that's
their
justification,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can't
they
spend
as
much
money...
and
here
i'm
not
positive.
i
thought,
but
it's
complicated,
that
the
rnc
can
write
a
check
for
a
million
dollars
if
it
wanted,
or
whatever
the
amount
is,
as
long
as
it's
hard
money.
it's
that
they're
forbidden
from
soliciting
or
spending,
et
cetera,
money
that
isn't
hard
money.
am
i
right
about
that
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
reason,
i
take
it,
for
that
is
the
administrative
reason
i
gave,
we're
focusing
on
the
contributions.
and
now
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
doesn't,
you
see,
it
doesn't
prohibit
their
donating
it.
they
can
donate
what
they
want,
i
heard
you
say.
it's
just
that
they
have
to
donate
it
out
of
hard
money
and
so
what
the
statute
is
actually
saying
is
that
any
penny
that
you
give
to
a
national
political
committee,
we
assume,
is
a
penny
that
will,
or
is
intended
to
or
will
influence
a
federal
election.
now,
now
that's...
why
is
that
an
unreasonable
assumption
to
make?
because
after
all,
even
if
that
committee
were
to
take
your
money
and
use
it
for
the
purposes
you
are
talking
about,
that
would
free
up
some
other
money
for
the
other
purposes.
and
so
congress
has
made
the
assumption
i
said.
now,
all
i'm
doing
is
going
through
all
the
reply
briefs
because
the
reply
briefs
take
each
of
your
examples
and
they
try
to
explain
what
it
was
that
congress
had
in
mind.
so
it
would
help
me
if
you,
you
know,
sort
of
start
with
the
assumption.
i
know
your
argument,
i
think.
and
i
think
i
know
the
reply,
and
what
do
you
want
to
say
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
the
reason
it
does
that,
i
mean,
on
the
first
part,
i
guess
if
you
won,
you
would
find
a
donor
who
was
wanting
to
give
money
to
the
rnc
just
to
help
the
state.
and
you
want
him
to
be
able
to
write
his
check
for
9
million.
well,
you
are
talking
about
9
million
i
guess
out
of
several
hundred
million,
so
i
don't
know
if
you
won
on
that,
it
would
help
you
that
much,
if
you
really
got
just
what
you
wanted
there.
but
now
you
are
going
to
the
second
part,
and
on
the
second
part,
the
way
congress
has
done
this
is
it
says,
after
all,
we
understand
that
state
parties
in
an
election
with
federal
candidates
on
the
ballot,
have
an
interest
in
getting
state
candidates
elected
and
federal
candidates,
and
so
we
will
allocate,
and
i,
and
then
contrary,
i
think,
to
what
i
heard
mr.
starr
say,
i
think
they
produce
one
of
the
most
complex
allocation
systems
i
have
ever
read.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
the
fact
that
it's
complex
doesn't
mean
it's
wrong.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
balance
a
lot
of
different
interests,
so
now
you
explain
to
me
what's
wrong
with
it,
what
they've
tried
to
do
is
allocate
the
cost
of
getting
the
voter
to
the
polls
between
some
special
state
money
and
between
federal
hard
money,
and
they
have
their
reasons,
i
think,
as
you
have
seen
from
the
reply
brief,
for
each
one
of
the
special
restrictions
that's
in
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
no,
you
wanted
to
bring,
you
wanted
to
discuss
that.
i'm
saying
if
you
want,
do
want
to
discuss
it,
i'd
certainly
be
interested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
their
reason
for
that,
their
reason
for
that,
i
take
it,
is
because
joe
rich,
who
wants
to
write
the
check
for
6
million,
when
faced
with
this
statute
and
the
levin
amendment,
which
allows
him
to
give
$10,000
to
each
district
committee,
the
western
sunset
block
association
of
the
democratic
party.
the...
there
could
be
thousands
of
such
associations,
and
since
there
could
be
thousands,
if
they
did
not
have
that
restriction,
all
that
would
happen
is
that
the
state
committee
would
write
to
mr.
joe
rich
and
say
write
the
check
for
$6
million
to
me,
and
then
what
he'd
do
is
he
would
divide
that
$6
million
up
among
our
10,000
local
committees,
and
you
see,
it
would
be
a
hole
that
is
not
just
an
inch
wide,
but
15
miles
wide,
and
so
they
threw
some
sand
in
those
gears.
and
the
sand
in
those
gears
is
just
what
you
described.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
going
to
say...
there
is
still...
the
reason...
to
get
that
10,000
to
each
of
these
things,
at
least
they
have
to
act
independently.
and
they're
trying
to
make
that
local
committee
independent,
and
independent
even
of
the
federal
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
you
to
leave
without
having
a
chance
to...
but
i've
listed
so
far,
and
so
far
it's
not
going
to
kill
the
statute.
so
far
you're
upset
about
that
roman
numeral
ii...
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
roman
numeral
ii
on
the
homegrown
which
is
the
federal
contribution
to
hard
money.
that's
your
strongest
argument
there,
i
think.
so
you
say
strike
that
from
the
statute.
all
right,
we
take
out
roman
numeral
ii,
that's
not
going
to
kill
the
statute.
and
as
far
as
the
first
point
is
concerned,
at
worst,
concerning
you're
completely
right...
assuming
you're
right,
you
could
set
up
totally
segregated
accounts
for
donors
who
want
to
give
to
the
federal
party
to
money
that
will
be
used
for
purely
state
elections.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
national
parties.
you
could
do
that,
right,
and
without
hurting
the
statute
too
much.
now,
is
there
a
third
or
fourth...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
down
what
you
think
are
the
biggest
three
or
four
overly
broad
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any,
anything
in
there
that
says
whether
the
bulk
of
that
money
you
just
referred
to
by
the
950
donors,
that
more
went
to
challengers
than
to
incumbents?
or
that
more
went
to
incumbents
than
to
challengers?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
step
back
for
a
second.
because,
say,
looking
at
it
more
broadly,
i
think
we're
hearing
many
arguments
of
this
form,
which
is
a
serious
argument,
it
seems
to
me.
when
you
look
at
the
statute,
it
becomes
highly
complex
and
really
quite
restrictive
in
the
many
ways
that
have
been
mentioned.
at
the
same
time,
there
are
no
restrictions
on
the
press,
and
at
the
same
time,
you
can
give
as
much
money
as
you
want
to
the
nra,
to
the
nrdc,
to
every
interest
group
that
supports
both
the
republicans
or
the
democrats
or
whatever.
and
so
all
that
will
happen
is
that
the
power
and
the
money
will
shift
to
those
groups,
and
you
will
have
precisely
what
madison
called
faction,
because
the
parties
act
as
a
tempering
device.
that
if
$10
million
can
be
given
to
private
groups
to
get
out
the
vote,
and
if
the
election
is
about
getting
out
the
vote,
you've
shifted
the
power
from
the
party
to
the
special
interest
group.
and
now
the
press
was
one
example.
we're
hearing
arguments
of
that
form,
and
so
i
would
like
to
hear
a
general
response
to
that
kind
of
an
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
very
minor
detail
while
you're
on
it.
what
is
technically
the
reason
why
a
national
committee
can't
give
hard
money
to
a
local
district
using
levin
funds.
and
the
second
thing
is,
why
is
it
not
possible
to
have
a
segregated
account
for
a
national
party
in
which
a
person
would
put
in
money
that
was
only
going
to
be
used
to
give
to
the
state
for
elections
where
there
was
no
federal
candidate
on
the
ballot?
those
are
two
detailed
matters
i
just
want
to
get
your
response
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
pretty
big
loophole,
i
guess,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
they
write
and
say,
joe
rich,
give
your
6
million
to
the
following
500
committees.
they
write
50
checks
of
$10,000
each.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
homegrown,
my
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
not
that
they
can't
run
the
ad.
i
mean,
the
unions
can
run
the
ad.
the
corporations
can
run
the
ad.
the
aclu
can
run
the
ad.
they
all
can
run
the
ad.
it's
just
that
they
have
to
pay
for
it
out
of
a
pac.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--are
constitutional,
if
they
are
constitutional,
then
it's
pretty
hard
for
me
to
see
any
additional
burden
on
any
of
these
organizations
to
make
this
expenditure
on
the
ad
you
are
worried
about
through
a
pac.
what's
the
problem
of
saying,
go
through
the
pac,
and
what
we
achieve
by
that
is
limiting
the
amount
of
money
that
any
one
individual
can
give,
and
what
we
lose
by
it
is
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what's
your,
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
what
your
point
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
although
it's
all
right
go
to
joe
moneybags
and
say
joe
moneybags,
you
can
only
give
$100,000
every
two
years
to
the
democratic
party,
it's
not
all
right
to
go
to
joe
moneybags
and
say
joe
moneybags,
you
can
only
give
$100,000
a
year
to
the
afl-cio
or
the
pharmacies
or
somebody
for
the
purpose
of
running
a
similar
ad.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
you
can
limit
joe
moneybags
when
he
gives
the
money
to
a
political
party,
whose
whole
objective
is
speech
and
politics,
but
you
can't
limit
joe
moneybags
when
he
gives
the
money
for
the
same
type
of
activity
to
another
organization.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
basically
that...
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
that.
why
is
that...
i
thought
all
they
had
to
do
was,
if
they
want
to
raise
money
for
these
kinds
of
ads,
60
days
before
the
election,
mentioning
the
candidate's
name,
is
in
their
advertising,
they
say,
please
send
your
check
to
the
nra
election
time
pac.
do
they
have
to
do
more
than
that?
i
thought
they
had
to
open
a
bank
account,
they
have
to
appoint
somebody
a
treasurer,
they
have
to
make
disclosure.
and
it's
a
slight
difference
there
between
over
$250
rather
than
over
$10,000.
and
that's
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
you
can't
go
and
ask...
if
i
start
a
pac
or
anybody
here
starts
a
pac,
you
can't
go
and
just
ask
the
general
public
to
belong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
ask
them
to
join
the
pac?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
my
impression
is...
this
is
a
question
of
the
record,
really.
and
i
see
you
have
the
point.
i
mean,
there
could
be
burdens
of
the
kind
you're
recommending.
and
it
also
could
be
overly
broad
because
they're
the
genuine
issue
ads.
so
i
put
this
on
the
one
side.
and
then
i
put
on
the
other
side
that
if
we
strike
it
down...
well,
i
mean,
i
wouldn't
say
forget
the
whole
statute,
but
it
seems
pretty
close
because
you
get
several
hundred
million
dollars
to
run
exactly
the
same
ads
that
are
being
run
right
now
which
were
about
$500
million
worth
of
these
ads
saying...
they
don't
say
vote
against
smith.
they
say,
tell
smith
what
a
rat
he
is.
that's
what
they...
and
it
will
just
be
a
loophole
about
50
miles
wide.
and
all
this
money,
instead
of
going
to
the
democratic
national
committee
or
the
state
committee
or
something,
go
right
to
the
nra,
right
to
the
environmental
groups,
right
to
the
right
to
life
groups,
right
to
the
groups
the
opposite...
in
other
words,
everyone
who
has
a
cause
will
get
the
money
and
run
the
same
ads
that
really
this
was
designed
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
directly
worrying
me
is
i
think
that
title
ii
will
make
you
go
through
pacs
to
run
certain
ads.
a
handful
maybe,
maybe
a
little
bit
more
than
a
handful,
that
are
genuine
issue
ads.
and
to
the
extent
that
you
have
to
go
through
the
pac,
that
is
an
added
burden
and
i've
been
trying
to
pin
that
down
that
you've
been
very
helpful
on.
at
the
same
time,
there
may
not
be
too
many.
and
it
may
open
a
tremendous
loophole
in
what's
been
traditional,
the
corporations
and
labor
unions
do
not
and
cannot
contribute
to
getting
people
elected,
at
least
not
through
spending
money
and
contributions
at...
you
know
what
i'm
referring
to.
and
also,
it
might
open
a
major
loophole
where
joe
moneybags
makes
the
contribution
to
the
labor
union
or
to
the
corporation
that
he
previously
is
now
forbidden
to
give
to
the
party
itself.
those
are
the
two
things
and
you've
got
the
first
half
addressed,
and
i
would
like
to
hear
the
second
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they're
going
to
have
to
make
the
disclosures
anyway,
aren't
they?
i'd
like
to
get
clear
on
that.
even
if
this
were
unconstitutional,
the
other
provisions
that
require
them
just
about
the
same
disclosures?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we're
talking
about
basically
nothing,
is
that
right?
i'd
like
an
answer
to
that,
because
i...
just
to
clarify
it
in
my
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
at
some
point,
if
you
have
the
chance,
deal
with
what
is
a
genuine
problem
for
me?
i
think
labor
unions
and
corporations
for
30,
40,
50,
60
years
have
been
forbidden
to
make
expenditures
in
connection
with
a
federal
election.
now,
unless
you're
attacking
that
whole
thing,
i
take
it
what
this
turns
is
what
mr.
abrams
said,
overbreadth.
it
goes
too
far
in
defining
the
ads,
an
added
burden
with
the
pac.
i
have
taken
in
both
those.
i'll
check
them
out.
i
want
to
know
the
other
half
of
the
equation,
that
is,
i'd
like
you
to
spend
one
minute
explaining
to
me
why
i'm
wrong
in
thinking
that
if
you
win
on
this
point,
that
thing
that's
been
there
in
the
statute
since
1919,
we
might
as
well
throw
it
away,
and
or,
you
know,
they'll
make
expenditures
in
connection
with
an
election,
namely
these
huge
ads,
and
they
will
collect
loads
of
money
from
the
same
wealthy
people
to
help
them
along
with
those
expenditures.
i'd
just
like
one
minute
on
that
point
at
your
convenience.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they've
given
you
a
new
definition,
and
that's
the
issue,
of
course,
is
this
new
definition
okay,
and
we
are
back
to
where
we
started.
if
the
old
one
is
okay
given
those
problems
in
the
'40s,
why
isn't
the
new
one
okay
given
the
problems
of
the
'90s?
all
right.
but
anyway,
you
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
empirical
information
on
this
problem
in
the
record?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
empirical
information
on
this?
i
think
it's
fairly
significant.
you're
saying
it's
really
much,
much
harder
for
us
to
get
the
money
through
the
pac.
and
it
either
is
or
it
isn't.
and
there
either
is
some
empirical
information
or
there
isn't.
i
just
want
to
know
the
state-of-the-art.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why
is
that
not
true
with
a
political
party?
why
wouldn't
you
say
the
same
thing
with
a
candidate?
and
why
is
it,
if
we
can
limit
the
expenditure,
the
contributions
made
to
the
candidate
for
this
kind
of
thing
or
the
party,
why
couldn't
we
do
it
to
organizations
that
have
less
to
do
with
political
life,
for
corporations?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
think
the
premise
is
pay
for
it
out
of
your
pac.
not
to
limit
the
speech
but
rather
pay
for
it
out
of
certain
limited
contributions.
and
i
understand
your
argument
that
that's
harder
to
do.
it's
also
maybe
harder
to
do
for
a
party.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason...
my
question
was
the
reason
that
the
union
or
the
corporation
has
a
greater
right
here
than
the
political
party
itself
or
the
candidate
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
answer?
an
8
year-old?
nobody
under
the
age
of
8
can
give
a
contribution,
period,
end
of
the
matter,
that's
it,
that's
the
law,
constitutional
or
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
still
appreciate
an
answer.
six
month
old,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wonderful.
now,
once
you
give
me
the
six
month
old...
once
you
give
me
the
six
month
old,
you've
agreed
that
at
some
age,
it's
reasonable
to
draw
a
line.
and
once
you're
down
that
road,
you
have
to
deal
with
the
obvious
question
that
the
constitution
draws
a
line
at
18
years
old
to
vote.
and
after
all,
it
was
thought
you
needed
a
constitutional
amendment
to
get
that
result.
and
so
what's
wrong
with
congress
saying,
well,
we
think
the
problem's
about
the
same
when
you
give
money
to
a
candidate
as
when
you
vote
for
a
candidate.
and
so
we're
going
to
pick
the
same
line.
there
are
many
17
year
olds
who
would
be
excellent
voters
and
there
are
many
older
people
who
are
terrible,
okay?
so
they
pick
this
line
for
that,
we
would
like
this
line
for
this.
and
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
didn't
the
fec
have,
didn't
they
continuously
write
about
this
and
say
there
seemed
to
be
an
awful
lot
of
tiny
children
who
are
sending
in
money
for
your
trust
funds
or
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
did
they
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how,
how,
how
do
you...
how
do
you
protect
it
if
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
mccain-feingold
bill
or
the
roth
ira
or
something
like
that,
where
the,
where
there
is
a
candidate's
name
attached
to
specific
legislation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
you.
you
want
us
to
say
just
what
justice
kennedy
said,
that
the
distinction
is
ephemeral,
right?
now,
we've
heard
the
distinction
is
ephemeral.
and
if
you
can
ban
the
express,
you
can
ban
the
issue
ad
which
mentions
the
name.
and
now
there
were
two,
i
thought,
safe
harbors.
safe
harbor
number
1
is
what
justice
souter
said,
don't
mention
the
name
of
the
candidate
60
days
before
election.
safe
harbor
number
2,
which
i
had
been
discussing
before,
which
i
wanted
your
response
to,
was
the
pac.
now,
i
thought
it
wasn't
too
tough,
say,
for
philip
morris
or
ciba
geigy,
if
they
really
want
to
mention
the
candidate's
name,
to
set
up
a
pac.
now,
i've
heard
that
that's
not
so,
that
i
was
wrong
about
that.
and
the
reason
that
i
was
wrong,
i've
just
been
told,
as
you
heard
too,
is
because
it's
going
to
be
hard
for
these
big
corporations
and
the
labor
unions
to
raise
the
money
through
the
pac
to
run
the
very
ad
with
the
name
of
the
candidate
in
the
last
60
days.
i
would
like
your
view
about
that.
do
you
think
that's
right
and
not
just
subjectively,
is
there
any
evidence
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
like
to
think
that
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
there
a
way
of
writing
an
opinion
that
would
say,
if
a
particular
organization
otherwise
covered
does
have
some
unusual
problem
with
a
pac,
either
because
it
doesn't
want
to
say
it's
political
or
because
it
can't
raise
the
money,
that's
a
matter
for
an
as-applied
challenge
later?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
they
want
to
know
why.
and
i
suppose
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
that
the
times
or
any
radio
station
runs
an
editorial
saying,
vote
for
smith,
or
jones
is
against
labor,
for
example,
but
if
a
union
or
corporation
runs...
pays
for
the
ad
on
the
next
page
it
falls
right
within
the
ad.
i
thought
that
the
reason
had
to
do
with
the
traditional
role
of
the
newspaper
where
we
expect
them
to
have
reporters,
some
of
whom
will
in
fact
think
one
thing
and
some
will
think
another
and
the
editorials
may
or
may
not
make
sense,
but
there
are
considerable
implications
for
regulating
those
that
don't
exist
when
we
talk
about
philip
morris
or
the
municipal
workers
union.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the--
