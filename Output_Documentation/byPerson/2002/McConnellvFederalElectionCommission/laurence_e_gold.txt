mr.
laurence
e.
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
earlier
this
term
in
the
nike
case,
the
afl-cio
took
the
unusual
step
of
filing
an
amicus
brief
arguing
that
the
vital
first
amendment
interest
in
public
access
to
information
and
ideas
leaves
the
government
no
room
to
inhibit
business
corporations
from
speaking
out
on
matters
of
public
concern.
today,
we
appear
on
our
own
behalf
and
aligned
with
business
corporations
and
non-profit
incorporated
groups
in
support
of
that
same
principle.
i
would
like
to
pick
up--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
am
laurence
gold.
we're
not
related.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i'm
also
instructed
by
your
rules
not
to
introduce
myself.
i
would
like
to
first
revisit
the
pac
point,
and
then
also
address
the
back-up
definition
of
electioneering
communications
in
the
distinct
but
very
vital
issue
of
coordination
in
this
case.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i'll
do
it
now,
justice
breyer.
the
prescription
of
expenditures
in
the
law
which
dates
back
to
the
1940s
was
first
defined
by
this
court
in
buckley
and
then
in
mcfl
to
mean
express
advocacy,
and
that
in
fact
is
the
only
kind
of
expenditure
that
the
law
has
prescribed,
and
there
is
only
one
instance
where
this
court
has
even
approved
a
restriction
of
those
kinds
of
expenditures
on
any
party
or
any
kind
of
organization
that
is
subject
to
203,
and
that
was
of
course
the
austin
case.
but
the
notion
that
expenditures
in
an
untrammeled
sense
or
an
unbounded
sense--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
it
wasn't
clear
really
in
the
'40s
what
the
term
expenditure
met.
there
were
two
cases,
the
uew
case
and
the
cio
case,
that
explored
that
and
pointed
out
that
there
was
some
doubt
there.
in
this
case,
the
notion
has
been
brought
into,
way
beyond
anything
that
might
affect
an
election.
the
mere,
the
touchstone
of
this
statute
is,
if
you
refer
to
a
candidate
within
a
certain
time
to
a
certain
audience,
you
are
prescribed
from
doing
so.
and
this
record
shows
the
subjective
aspect
of
it,
i
think,
that
the
buying
time
studies
underscored,
i
think
the
defendants
no
longer
subscribe
to.
but
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
replete
with
instances
where
groups
use
ads
not
even
in
the
mixed
sense
that
buckley
said
was
very
important,
but
in
the
sense
of
doing
something
that's
urgently
necessary
for
the
organization
at
the
time.
for
example,
three
afl-cio
ads
that
ran
in
quick
succession
in
september
1998
denied,
in
barker
and
spearmint,
all
addressed
legislation
that
the
republican
majority
on
issues
of
grave
concerns
to
the
afl-cio
had
hastily
scheduled,
and
we
came
up,
we
devised
ads
in
a
few
days'
notice
and
broadcast
ads
in
a
number
of
states
in
order
to
pressure
particular
members
of
congress
in
the
senate
and
the
house
on
how
they
should
vote
on
that
legislation
on
a
vote
that
was
actually
taking
place
five
days
later.
it
was
pure
happenstance
that
that
vote
occurred
in
september
of
1998
rather
than
say
september
of
1999,
when
this
prescription
would
not
have
been
upon
us.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
this
makes...
there's
a
tremendous
difference
between
the
union
doing
it
and
the
union
having
to
do
it
from
a
pac.
and
to
force
a
union,
for
example,
to
do
this
sort
of
spending
out
of
its
pac
would
reverse
the
notion
that
this
court
has
followed
in
a
series
of
cases
from
machinists
v.
street
through
beck
that
the
dissent
of
a
union
member
on
matters
is
not
to
be
presumed,
that
people
don't
have
to
opt
in
to
speaking,
that
they,
at
best
one
can
require
somebody
to
opt
out.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
in
austin,
when
the
court
addressed
this
in
the
context
of
business
corporations,
it
pointed
out
that
there
were
crucial
differences
between
corporations
and
unions
on
precisely
this
point,
that
the
two
governmental
interests.
and
the
only
case
where
this
court
has
ever
approved
an
actual
restriction
on
express
advocacy,
the
two
interests
identified
there
are
the
two
aspects
of
the
entity
there,
mainly
aggregation
of
wealth...
or
the
immense
aggregation
of
wealth
by
virtue
of
the
corporate
forum,
not
aggregation
of
wealth
alone.
and
whether
or
not
the
spending
reflected
the
views
of
members
or
shareholders
this
court
pointed
out
were
inapplicable
to
unions.
so
the
premise
i
think
doesn't
necessarily
apply.
and
the
speech
we're
talking
about
here,
of
course,
goes
well
beyond
even
the
express
advocacy
expenditures
at
issue
in
austin.
express
advocacy
is
different.
express
advocacy,
whatever
the
value
of
whether
or
not
it
should
be
regulated,
is
certainly
unambiguous
in
two
senses.
one,
there
is
a
specific
request
for
voting
decision.
and
two,
it
is
virtually
certain
that
the
listener
is
going
to
take
that
into
account
as
to
whether
or
not
to
make
a
voting
decision.
you
can't
say
that,
i
think,
about
any
other
kind
of
speech,
including
speech
that
makes
reference
to
candidates.
and
the
burdens
here,
i
think
to
pick
up
on
the
discussion
earlier,
are
very
important
with
respect
to
a
pac.
it's
one
thing
for
an
advocacy
organization,
like
the
nra
and
the
aclu,
which
can
and
routinely
do
appeal
for
funds
to
the
general
public
to
be
restrained
as
mr.
abrams
described.
but
unions
and
corporations
don't
have
the
ability
to
seek
contributions
just
from
anybody.
there
is
the
notion
in
the
statute
of
a
restricted
class.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
actually,
your
honor,
they
can't.
they
can
to
their
general
treasury,
but
with
respect
to
a
pac,
you
are
limited
to
soliciting
only,
in
the
case
of
a
union,
your
members
or
your
executive
administrative
staff
and
their
families.
in
the
case
of
a
business
corporation,
only
your
shareholders
and
executive
administrative
personnel.
these
are
not
organizations
that
can
for
their
pacs
seek
contributions
from
anybody
else.
it's
long
been
unlawful
under
the
federal
election
campaign
act
to
solicit
beyond
those
classes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i'm
sorry?
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yeah,
well,
there
is
some.
in
fact,
the
only
judge
below
who
made
findings
on
this
was
judge
henderson.
in
her
findings
on
this
in
the
supplemental
appendix
at
pages
249,
50,
259
to
60,
270
to
71,
which
concern
the
afl-cio's
difficulty
in
raising
pac
money.
and
page
347,
note
142.
it
refers...
there
is
an
affidavit
by
the
then
afl-cio
political
director
describing
the
difficulty
of
raising
pac
money
and
how
that
would
not
change,
certainly
perhaps
be
even
worsened
under
this
new
regime.
and
there
are
affidavits
that
the...
i
think
as
part
of
the
rnc
submission
from
four
other
labor
organizations
that
describe
the
relative
resources
of
their
organizations
and
their
pacs.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
i
think
that's
one
way
to
look
at
it,
but
i
think
what
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
a
number
of
cases,
and
belotti
is
a
particularly...
a
pertinent
case
for
this,
is
that
it's
not
so
much
the
speaker.
the
value
of
speech
is
not
so
much
from
the
source,
whether
it's
a
union
or
corporation
or
some
other
group.
the
value
of
speech
is
the
informational
value
that
it
gets
to
the
public
at
large,
the
enabling
that
that
speech
does
for
people
to
participate
in
civic
life.
and
the
fact
that
it's
from
a
corporate
source
or
for
a
union
source
does
not
devalue
that
speech.
so
it's
not
so
much
that
the
speaker
has
a
first
amendment
right
as
such,
but
the
value
of
that
speech
to
the
populus
as
a
whole--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--in
this
case,
there
is
a
volume
criterion
in
the
sense...
volume--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's
what
i
meant.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
think
there
is
a
volume
effect
by
this
statute
and
i
think
that's
clearly
part
of
the
intention
of
this.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
your
honor,
that's--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--that
certainly
is
part
of
the
interest.
there
is
a
tremendous
interest
in
people
and
groups
and
organizations
being
able
to
address
public
issues.
and
the
election
period,
which
this
court
has
identified
and
which
the
record
supports,
including
one
of
the...
at
least
one
of
the
defendant's
experts,
mr.
magleby,
is
that
that's
a
time
when
people
are
especially
attentive
to
public
issues.
and
the
fact
that
some
of
this
speech
may
seem
to
have
a,
quote,
effect
on
the
election,
which
is
after
all
the
standard
that
the
defendants
now
justify
this
for,
the
fact
that
there
might
be
some
effect
can't
possibly
be
a
reason
in
order
to
stifle
it.
if
we
start
down
that
road--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
think
title
i
has
both
contribution
and
expenditure
aspects.
but
here
one
is
talking
about
limiting
the
independent
speech.
that's
the
premise
of
section
203
is
that
this
is--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--it's
not
just
harder
to
do,
but
it
really
does,
i
think,
distort
the
message.
it
inherently
is
distorting
a
message
that
is
nonelectoral
if
you
have
to
do
out
of
a
pac.
if
you
have
to
tell
people
you're
soliciting
for
this
fund.
it's
not
enough
i
think
to
label
it
something.
the
law
has
imposed
a
structure
on
these
committees.
they
are
political
committees.
they
register
with
the
federal
election
commission.
members
of
these
organizations
are
used
to
the
fact
that
they
are
designed
and
used
for
making
contributions.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
it's
that
it
is...
it's
not
at
all
connected
with
the
concerns
of
corruption
or
appearance
of
corruption
that
have
animated
and
underlie
this
court's
jurisprudence
when
it
comes
to
contributions.
this
is
independent
private
speech.
and
from
buckley
on
and
new
york
times
versus
sullivan,
this
court
has
recognized
the
value
of
speech,
even
about
elections
by
these
groups.
there
is
no
rationale
for
muting
their
ability
to
speak
on
public
matters
and
speak
on
electoral
matters.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
think
one
of
the...
something
that
seems
to
animate
this
is
the
thought
that
certain
voices
do
have
to
be
muted.
and
i
think
the
principle
in
buckley,
the
fact
that
speech...
inevitably
speech
on
candidates,
speech
on
issues,
that
it's
inevitably
mixed
in,
inextricably
linked,
is
really
at
issue
in
this
case.
because
what
this
statute
says
is
when
that's
the
case,
you
silence
it,
you
make
it
criminal
or
you
force
people
to
raise
money
separately
under
a
separate
rubric
and
call
it
electionary
communications,
and
call
it--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
follows.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
it's
been
regulating
express
advocacy
alone.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
think
that's
a
fair
question
that
the
court
does
not
have
to
reach
in
this
case.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
this
case,
in
our
view,
turns
on
the
overbreadth,
regardless
of
whether
express
advocacy
is
regulable.
this
provision,
we
believe,
goes
down...
and
should
go
down
on
the
basis
of
overbreadth.
one
could
assume
that
express
advocacy--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--it's
because...
leaving
express
advocacy
aside--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes,
in
the
sense
that
it
goes...
express
advocacy
by
definition
is
not
an
electionary
communication.
the
statute
says
that.
it's
everything
else.
this
is
overbroad,
not
just
because
some
of
the
speech
might
influence...
might
affect
an
election,
or
influence
an
election,
but
that
it's
criminalizing
references
to
candidates--
