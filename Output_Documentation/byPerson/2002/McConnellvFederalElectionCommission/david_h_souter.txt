justice
david
h.
souter
but
as
i
understand
it,
your
criterion
for
drawing
the
line
at
what
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
is
the
proportionality
and
congruence
criterion,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
how
do
you
factor
into
the
application
of
that
criterion,
the
basic
argument
made
on
the
other
side
in
this
case,
that
if
you
do
not
allow
what
congress
has
done
here,
you
are,
in
effect,
allowing
a
complete
end
run
around
the
prior
law?
how
does
that
factor
into
congruence
and
proportionality?
do
we
ignore
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
large
donations
or
a
thousand
smaller
donations?
the
end
run
problem
is
exactly
the
same.
and
one
reason
i
suppose
it's
the
same
is
the
argument
that
you
made,
and
that
is
the
close
association
between
the
state
and
the
national
committees.
and
i
don't
see
how
your
argument
addresses
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
the
difficulty,
mr.
burchfield,
that
i
have
with
your
argument,
i
know
where
you
are
going,
but
the
difficulty
i
have
is
in
determining
what
the
criterion
is
going
to
be.
if
we
accept
the
buckley
standard,
which
you
do,
for
the
purpose
of
your
argument,
then
it
seems
to
me
your
criterion
for
applying
the
buckley
standard
is
similar
to
what
mr.
starr
was
getting,
getting
at.
you
say
it
goes
too
far.
and
we
have
said
over
and
over
again
when
we
are
applying
that
standard,
we
don't
have
a
scalpel,
and
i
don't
know
how
we
apply
a
too-far
or
not-too-far
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
with
respect,
i
know
you
are
arguing
that,
but
i
also
understood
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
to
be
that
even
if
we
take
the
lesser,
the
more
relaxed
criterion
under
buckley,
that
you
also
win
and
you
win
on
a
standard
that
it
goes
too
far,
and
my
problem
is
assuming
all
of
those
things,
i
don't
see
how
we
apply
a
too-far
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
realize
that
argument.
i
just
want
to
get
at
the...
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy,
which
was
even
if
you
apply
the
more
complacent
standard,
we
win.
that's
the,
that's
the
assumption
of
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
we
have
a
too-far
standard
that
we
apply
under
win
under
a
too-far
standard?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
it...
the
reason
it
is
such
a
restriction
is
that
justice
scalia
is
limited
in
what
he
can
raise
in
money
beyond
his
salary,
and
the
national
parties
are
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
can
raise
more
money
if
they
want
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
which
case,
the
limitation
on
receiving
is
simply
a
formal
limitation.
everybody
knows
where
the
money
comes
from,
everybody
knows
what
the
money
is
supposed
to
be
used
for.
so
that
if
your
argument
to
justice
ginsburg
is
good,
i
think
the
argument
for
regulation
is
all
over.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
case,
in
his
official
capacity,
he
can't
do
it.
the
candidate
can.
justice
ginsburg's
question
stands.
what
is
the
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you
in
your
sentence.
but
my
question
to
you
was
going
to
be,
do
you
deny
that
a,
that
in
a
situation
that
justice
scalia
describes,
that
there
may
be
an
as-applied
challenge
whereas
the
possibility
of
that
situation
does
not
necessarily
carry
a
facial
challenge?
justice
david
h.
souter
beyond
express
advocacy,
do
you
concede
that
anything
can
be
regulated?
justice
david
h.
souter
--can
you
ask
them
to
join
the
pac?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
can
the
nra
go
out
and
say,
look,
we
want
you
to
join
the
nra,
x
dollars.
we
also
want
you
to
give
the
pac
some
money,
y
dollars.
can
they
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
they
can
do
that,
then
your
argument
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
when
people
are
told
that
they
have
to
join,
and
the
money
is
going
to
be
used
for
this
purpose,
they're
going
to
be
less
interested
in
doing
it.
and
i
don't
know
why
that
entitles
you
to
a
preferable
advertising
break,
in
effect,
in
the
name
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
includes
responses
to
a
request
like
this.
you
don't
have
to
join
the
nra
to
give
us
money
to
run
these
ads.
please
give
us
money
to
run
these
ads.
that's
what
goes
into
their
treasury
now
and
you're
saying
they
can't
get
that.
is
that
it?
is
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
functional
result?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
plain
from
the
record
that
when
a...
and
i
just
don't
remember
this,
but
i
remember
the
terms.
but
i
don't
remember
the
answer
to
this
question.
is
it
plain
that
in
these
discussions,
the
term
genuine
issue
ad
meant
an
ad
that
dealt
with
issues
to
the
exclusion
of
any
reasonable
interpretation
that
it
also
dealt
with
advocacy
for
candidates?
because
most
of
these
ads,
i
think
everybody
would
agree,
are
hybrids.
sure,
they
really
do
address
issues,
and
there
is
also
a
very
clear
implication
about
what
they
want
you
to
do
in
the
ballot
booth.
so
does
genuine
exclude
the
possibility
of
a
ballot
booth
implication?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
was
out
of
context,
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
just
saw
the
ad.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
was
a
false
dichotomy.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
because
it
was
a
false
dichotomy,
i
don't
know
what
to
make
of
7
percent
of
14
percent.
justice
david
h.
souter
like
the
belotti
situation,
the
belotti
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
boy,
but
you
could
have,
you
could
have
fooled
me.
they
want
the
term
limit
because
they
want,
they
want
somebody
to
vote
for
someone
other
than
wu.
i
mean,
how
else
can
you
read
that?
i
mean,
i
can
understand
a
belotti
situation
in
which
you've
got
a,
in
effect
a
referendum
going
on
in
which
the
voters
are
going
to
have
a
direct
choice,
a
ballot
initiative
kind
of
thing,
but
once
you
get
into
a
situation
in
which
the
so-called
issue
ad
is
in
the
context
of
an
election,
i
would
suppose
you
would
have
a
tough
road
to
hoe
to
prove
a
pure
non-electoral
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
gold,
i
take
it
you
are
arguing
that
a
labor
union
or
a
corporation,
for
that
matter,
has
a
first
amendment
right
to
speak
on
behalf
of
more
than
its
membership
or
respectively
its
stockholders.
why
should
that
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
you
are
saying,
i
think,
that
there
is
a
kind
of
first
amendment
volume
requirement
that
goes
well
beyond
what
in
the
contribution
context
we
referred
to
as
reducing
the
speech
to
something
that
doesn't
amount
to
anything
at
all.
you're
saying
that
when
we're
talking
about
direct
expenditures,
when
an
organization
is
speaking
that
way,
that
there
really
is
a
kind
of
volume
criterion,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
membership.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
my
distinct
regional
accent
again.
i've
just
come
back
from
new
hampshire.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you're
right,
the
prior
law
goes
down
the
drain,
too,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
certainly
muting,
it's
been
regulating
for
60
years,
longer
than
that
in
corporations
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
why
should
express
advocacy
be
disfavored.
justice
stevens'
question
all
over
again.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
we
have
to
reach
it
if
we're
going
to
accept
your
premise.
justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
say
overbreadth,
you
say
because
it
goes
beyond
express
advocacy.
that's
all
you
need.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
that
what
you
mean?
isn't
that
your
principal
overbreadth
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
doesn't...
doesn't
the
primary
definition
today,
in
effect,
give
a
corporation
or
a
union
that
wants
to
run
an
issue
ad
a
safe
harbor
simply
by
virtue
of
not
mentioning
the
name?
say,
let's
hear
it
for
nuclear
power
and
don't
let
anybody
else
tell
you
otherwise.
that's
safe,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
wouldn't
it
go
further
than
that?
i
mean,
if,
if
the
argument
that
the
press
should
be
subject
to
the
same
limitations
and
presumably
have
the
same
powers,
then
the
press
would
have
to
publish
a
separate
newspaper
through
a
pac
in
order
to
make
the
otherwise
limited
expression
during
the
30-day
period.
i
mean,
that
can't
be
done.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that,
that
same
objective
could
be
obtained
simply
by
requiring
disclosure
by
the
station
as
soon
as
they,
as
soon
as
they
run,
i
mean,
file
a
report
on
the
day
that
the
ad
runs.
