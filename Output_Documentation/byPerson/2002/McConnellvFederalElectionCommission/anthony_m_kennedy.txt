justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
i
understand
your
position
that
congress
could
have
provided
that
there
be
a
strong
wall
between
national
and
state
and
local
parties
so
that
no
funds
could
be
transferred
inter
se?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what...
what's
the
speech
interest
if
congress
says
there
can
be
no
transfers
of
funds
between
different
levels
of
the
party,
what
is
this
firstndment
violation
in
that?
and
in
fact,
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
in
your
earlier
remarks
that
congress
might
have
done
something
like
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
my
question
was,
could
congress
allow
communications
of
all
type,
but
forbid
transfer
of
funds
between
different
levels
of
the
party?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
order
to
rule
for
you
on
all
of
the
issues
that
are
presented
in
title
i...
let's
just
talk
about
title
i.
do
we
have
to
cut
back
on
the
second
rationale
given
in
buckley,
the
endorsement
speech
is
of
low
value?
or
can
we
accept
buckley
on
its
face
for
all
that
it
says
and
still
rule
for
you
on
every
one
of
these
points?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
problem
i'm
having
is
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
bringing
out
the
federalism
argument
and
we
were
talking
about
the
speech
argument.
let's
assume
the
attorney
general
is
going
to
prevail
and
the
federal
government
has
power
to
regulate.
still
is
a
first
amendment
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
first
amendment
answer
that
you
can
give
to
justice
breyer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
quite,
quite
apart
from
the,
the
allocation
problem,
to
pursue
justice
ginsburg's
inquiry
because
it's
something
i'm
interested
as
well,
suppose
that
we
rule
for
you
on
all
of
these
issues
under
title
i,
and
we
do
so
on
a
first
amendment
rationale.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
we
then
striking
down
the
laws
of
any
states
and
if
so,
how
many?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
that
is
all
that
it
does.
it
regulates
contributions
to
parties
and
the
argument
is
that's
quite
different
from
a
contribution
to
a
candidate,
which
is
one
of
the
issues
here,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
about
a
contribution
to
the
party,
we'll
call
it
a
payment
to
the
party?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
found
that
this
law
had
the
purpose
or
the
effect
of
giving
significant
advantage
to
incumbents,
would
we
have
to
strike
it
down
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
there
is
a
first
amendment
interest
in
protecting
incumbency?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
say
in
your
brief
and
in
mr.
waxman's
brief,
you
indicate
that
buckley
has
to
be
revised
because
speech
has
evolved
in
a
way
that
buckley
didn't
anticipate.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
an
argument
for
not
allowing
severe
regulations,
such
as
this
statute
does,
and
allows
speech
to
develop
on
its
own.
so
that
parties,
which
are
very
important
entities
in
the
system,
have
the
capacity
to
respond
to
other
unregulated
entities
such
as
the
press.
the
press
is
exempt
from
all
of
these
restrictions
and
parties
are
not.
that
seems
to
me,
mr.
olson,
a
very
curious
balance
in
a
democratic
society.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
two
steps.
why
is
a
contribution
or
payment
to
the
nra
any
less
a
contribution
than
a
payment
to
the
republican
party
in
certain
instances
with
certain
candidates?
you
equate...
the
statute
equates,
and
so
i
think
you
must.
you
equate
parties
and
candidates.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
a
remarkable
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
feeling
of
obligation
and
access
to
an
organization
which
delivers
a
million
votes
on
its
own?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
just,
that's
just
a
political
calculation?
there's
no
first,
there's
no
constitutional
standing
for
parties
to
protect
their
capacity
to
formulate
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
our
experience
in
buckley
was
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
understand--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
understand
why
you
would
want
to
keep
what
one
of
the
briefs
calls
this
impregnable
line
because
then
you
are
within
buckley,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
distinction
is
just
meaningless,
that
the
findings
below,
in
judge
kollar-kotelly's
opinion
make
it
clear
that
this
is
just,
this
is
just
a
silly
distinction
in
many
cases.
why
don't
we
just
junk
it
and
begin
with
there,
begin
anew,
and
begin
anew?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
nothing
in
the
record
bears
that
out.
the
findings--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
all
of
the
district
judges,
i
think,
were
quite
compelling
on
this
point
that
the
really
astute,
sophisticated
candidate
doesn't
say
vote
for
me
either.
he
uses
or
she
uses
some
other
means.
i
mean,
the
speech
law
has
evolved
since
buckley,
which
is
perhaps
one
reason
this
court
shouldn't
try
to
control
its
evolution.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
agree
with
the
implication
of
justice
breyer's
suggestion
that
in
order
to
save
section
1,
we
have
to
abridge
first
amendment
rights
under
section
2?
i
suppose
it
could
work
the
other
way
around.
section
2
must
be
stricken
because
there
is
a
first
amendment
violation,
and
title
i
becomes
meaningless.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
the
government
has
relied
very
heavily
this
morning
on
the
findings
made
by
the
congress
and
by
the
district
court.
and
this
afternoon
you
are
confronted
with
the
fact
that
the
district
court
has
said
basically
that
the
distinction
between
express
advocacy
and
issue
ad
is
essentially
meaningless
and
everybody
knows
it,
so
why
should
we
base
our
decision
on
that
distinction,
when
the
district
court
has
found,
and
i
think
there's
very
little
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
it's
simply
ephemeral?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
so
that
you
could
come
back
next
year
and
say
that
the
congress,
the
pure
issue
ads
must
also
be
prohibited?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
that
must,
that's
the
necessary
consequence
of
what
you
just
said.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
one
of
us
to
write
an
opinion
for
the
court
sustaining
the
statute
on
a
ground
which
everyone
knows
is
ephemeral
and
meaningless?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
case
do
you
have
that
we
can
distinguish
speech
based
on
the
identity
of
the
speaker?
outside
of
this
area?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
this,
this
is
a
serious
question.
a
large
part
of...
of
the
necessity,
or
at
least
the
perceived
necessity
for
these
ads
is
to
counter
the
influence
of
the
press.
this...
this
is
a
very
serious
first
amendment
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
have...
and
you
have
no
authority
for
this
distinction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
do
you
think
should
be
the
underlying
valid
principle
that
allows
that
distinction
to
be
drawn?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
that
a
group
of
citizens
concerned
about
what
they
consider
to
be
slanted
press
cannot
get
together,
have
a
corporation
and
take
out
issue
ads
on
the
other
side
of
that
issue?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--do
you
find
it
unusual
that
the
congress
is
powerless
to
favor
one
speaker
over
another?
is
that
such
an
astounding
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
i
don't
want...
because
this
is
important.
no
one
has
said,
suggested
that
what
is
less
than
clear?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
there
was
substantial
suggestion
that
clearly
identified
candidate
is
not
clear.
it
is
not
at
all
clear
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
clarified
that.
i
didn't
mean
to
throw
you
off.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
congress
found
that
these
ads
made
them
feel
very
bad,
and
we
would
not
accept
that
they
criticized
the
incumbents.
we
wouldn't
accept
that
rationale
from
a
city
council.
why
should
we
do
it
from
the
congress?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
saying
that
was
not
any
part
of
the
rationale
for
the
enactment
of
a
legislation?
