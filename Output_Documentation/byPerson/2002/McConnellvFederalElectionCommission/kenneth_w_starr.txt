mr.
kenneth
w.

mr.
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
title
1
of
bcra,
along
with
section
213
intrudes
deeply
into
the
political
life
of
the
nation,
and
does
so
in
a
way
that
not
even
the
most
ardently
nationalist
of
the
founding
generation
would
have
countenanced.
the
upshot
is
not
only
a
federal
intrusion
into
state
and
local
activity
at
the
grassroots
level,
but
a
significant
diminution
in
speech
and
associational
activity
by
parties,
activity
that
lies
at
the
very
core
of
the
first
amendment.
bcra's
practical
effect
is
to
shift
resources
and
power
away
from
political
parties
which
have
long
been
a
source
of
stability
for
the
nation,
and
in
the
direction
of
first
amendment-protected,
but
at
times
ideologically
razor-sharp
interest
groups.
bcra,
in
a
word,
goes
too
far.
there
were
other
ways
before
congress
that
congress
could
have
employed
most
relevantly.
to
the
extent
that
the
concern
of
congress
was
large
contributions
of
non-federal
funds,
those
regulated
by
the
states,
then
the
hagel
amendment
was
before
congress,
which
would
have
put
a
cap,
a
ceiling
on
the
level
of
contributions
to
the
national
parties,
but
preserving
the
prerogatives
of
the
state
and
local
parties.
secondly,
to
the
extent
that
the
concern
was
contributions
being
directed
toward
issue
ads,
congress
had
before
it
the
ney
amendment,
which
among
its
terms
provided
specifically
for
the
non-use
of
such
funds
in
connection
with
issue
ads.
thirdly,
to
the
extent
that
congress
was
concerned
as
it
clearly
was
with
the
abuses
of
the
recent
past,
as
documented
lavishly
in
the
thompson
committee
hearings,
congress
could
and
did
respond
in
bcra,
in
unchallenged
parts
of
bcra,
namely,
302
and
303,
addressing
specifically
fundraising
on
federal
property,
clarifying
what
had
been
famously
said
to
be
a
lacuna,
namely,
no
controlling
legal
authority.
also,
tightening
the
prohibitions
on
a
common
abuse
in
the
recent
past,
namely,
the
involvement
and
contribution
by
foreign
nationals,
the
james
riatti
situation.
but
congress
chose
not
to
do
this.
it
rather,
in
323a,
chose
to
ban,
ban,
not
limit,
but
ban,
but
also
to
regulate
relationships
and
associations
among
the
different
levels
of
the
parties.
in
323b,
congress
went
so
far
as
to
regulate
state
and
local
political
activity
that
is
at
the
most
grassroots
level
and
is
documented
lavishly
in
this
record,
especially
with
respect
to
the
state
of
california.
the
record
teems
with
indications
that
there
will
be
a
diminution
of
political
activity
by
the
political
parties,
both
parties,
both
of
the
major
parties,
the
california
democratic
party
and
the
california
republican
party.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
firewall
which
was
described
by
senator
mccain
does
in
fact
intrude
into
associational
activity
of
parties
and
the
structure
of
parties
that
this
court
has
found
protected
in
a
variety
of
cases
such
as
university
of
san
francisco
county,
tashjian
v.
connecticut.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
my
point
earlier
was
simply
to
say
there
were
other
alternatives
that
were
more
narrowly
tailored
before
congress,
but
with
respect
to
transfers
themselves,
the
transfers
this
record
show
go
among
to
other
things
to
enable
voter
mobilization
at
the
most
fundamental
level
and
activity,
and
this
again
is
documented
most
lavishly
in
california,
that
is
focused
upon
such
as
ballot
initiatives,
quintessential
state
activity
but
nonetheless
which
congress
sweeps
in
under
the
rubric.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
our
position.
if
i
failed
to
say
that,
i
say
it
now.
the
whole
idea...
and
i
clearly
did
fail
to
say
it.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
our
position
is
not
non-federal
funds,
which
by
definition
are
funds
that
are
either
regulated
or
subject
to
regulation
by
state
law.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
this...
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor,
but
this
court,
i
don't
think
has
authoritatively
answered
that
question.
footnote
10
in
colorado
republican
ii
notes
that
there
are
indications
in
the
court's
cases,
including
california
democratic
party
v.
jones
to
the
effect
that
there
is
in
fact
an
associational
right
on
the
part
of
those
who
have
come
together
as
an
association,
and
that
certainly
we
think
is
consistent
with
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
cases
such
as
eu
v.
san
francisco
county
democratic
party
and
tashjian
v.
connecticut.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
it's
fair
and
accurate
to
say
that
you
have
not
expressly
held
it.
that's
the
reading,
at
least,
of
this
court
in
footnote
10--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--as
i
read
it
in
colorado
republican
ii.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
certainly
an
allocation
process,
we
think,
can
in
fact
be
contemplated
in
terms
of
assuring
that
those
funds
which
are
subject
to
state
law
and
state
regulation
are
in
fact
free
to
be
regulated
by
the
state,
and
i
mean
by
way
of
specific
example,
the
people
of
california,
the
people
of
new
york
have
made
other
contrary
determinations
than
the
congress
did
with
all
respect
to
congress
with
respect
to
certain
forms
of
contributions.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i'm
not
saying
that
the
specific
allocation
was
constitutional
or
not.
that
was
not
tested.
but
my
answer
to
the
question
is
a
process
of
accommodation
of
the
state
interests
is
necessary
in
order,
your
honor,
we
believe
to
achieve
values
of
congruence--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--several
responses.
first,
let
me
begin
with
the
beginning
of
your
hypothetical,
large
contribution
from
the
major
donor,
the
hagel
amendment
addresses
that.
now,
with
respect,
that
is
let's
limit
the
contribution
which,
after
all,
is
the
fulcrum
of
concern,
namely,
the
possibility
of
corruption,
or
as
this
court
articulated
in
shrink
missouri
pac
in
colorado
ii,
undue
influence.
but
there
comes
a
point,
your
honor,
where
congress
goes
too
far
in
failing
to
accommodate
the
state
interest.
there
is
in
short
a
necessary,
under
this
court's
jurisprudence,
and
we
believe
anchored
in
the
federal
elections
clause
for
congress
to
assiduously
be
mindful
of
displacing
state
law,
and
that
is
what
has
been
done
here
by
virtue
of
essentially
not
even
trying
to
effect
an
allocation,
but
rather
simply
saying,
including
in
context
where
the
flow
of
funds
from
the
national
party
to
the
state
or
local
party
is
in
an
off-year
election.
the
value
that
we
would
have
left
up
to
the
court
is
that
of
congruence,
proportionality.
this
goes
much
too
far
and
congress
could
have
calibrated
much
more
carefully.
when
we're
talk...
we're
talking
about
limits,
by
the
way,
i
think
it's
fundamental
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
limits
with
respect
to
federal
contributions
are
anchored
on
the
idea
of
a
contribution
as
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
a
state
election.
what
the
record
shows
is
that
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
donations
in
the
system
that
go
for
quintessential
state
election
activity,
including
ballot
measures,
initiatives,
and
the
like.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
what
congress
has
seen
fit
to
do
is
regulate
activity
throughout
the
system,
including
then
a
federal
committee's
or
national
committee's
relationship
with
a
state
and
local
committee
that
ends
up
affecting
what
the
national
committee
can
do
in
mayoral
elections,
including
in
off-year,
that
is
to
say,
non-federal
elections
years.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
it's
a
quaint
idea.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
and
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
has
that,
and
it
is
a
very
good
system
of
total
transparency
and
it's
a
very
vibrant
system
that
is
not
infected
with
corruption
or
the
appearance
of
corruption
in
the
view
of
its
governor
and
others.
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
does
in
fact
embrace
the
idea
of
transparency.
why?
because
this
court
stated
in
buckley
that
a
contribution
is
a
first
amendment
event.
it
does
have
significance.
but
we
have
now
gone
beyond
that
which
congress
has
held
by
this
court
in
buckley
years
ago
to
have
an
interest
in
and
that
is
the
regulation
of
contributions
for
the
purpose
of
influencing...
that's
the
definition...
a
federal
election.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
fec
regime
was
invalid,
and
we
think
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--we're
not
suggesting
it.
the
issue
was
never
authoritatively
resolved.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not
at
all,
because
what
the
fec
did
for
all
those
years,
and
they're
settled
expectations
that
were
built
upon
that
system,
was
a
recognition
of
the
state's
prerogatives.
this
is
very
powerfully
expressed
in
the
fec's
20-year
report,
which
speaks
about
our
federal
system
and
the
very
idea,
and
therefore,
declining
to
use
the
pejorative
term,
quote,
soft
money,
because
other
states
have
different
attitudes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
that
is
instructive
as
to
what--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
your
honor,
because
again,
justice
souter,
congress
had
before
it...
if
the
problem
was
these
large
donations
giving
rise
to
the
appearance
of
corruption
or
undue
influence--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
your
honor,
we
think
it
does
in
terms
of
simply
recognizing
the
traditional
interests
of
the
states
that
we
think
is,
again,
anchored
in
the
elections
clause
itself
that
congress
simply
does
not
have
authority.
and
this
court's
teaching
in
terms
limits
i
think
is
to
the
sane
effect,
that
congress
simply
lacks
authority
even
if
it,
quote,
sees
a
problem
which
it
has
seen
in
morrison
and
lopez
and
a
variety
of
cases
that
congress
can
go
in
our
federal
system
too
far.
and
that's
even
in
the
context
of
the
commerce
clause.
and
here
the
elections
clause
goes
to
a
quintessential
sovereign
interest
of
the
states.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
very
briefly.
point
1.
there
has
been
a
tendency
in
much
of
the
argument
to
equate
candidates
with
a
political
party.
that
is
quite
incompatible
with
this
court's
cases,
colorado
i,
colorado
ii.
it
also
is
inconsistent,
i
think,
in
a
very
fundamental
level
with
citizens
against
rent
control.
parties
are
very
keenly
interested...
i
cite
california...
in
ballot
initiatives
and
the
like.
parties
exist
for
a
number
of
reasons.
this
court
said
as
much
in
the
principle
opinion
in
colorado
i.
parties
exist
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
people
together
to
articulate
a
world
view.
a
vision
of
what,
in
fact,
is
good
for
society.
and
political
parties
are
now
finding
themselves...
and
we
point
to
the
record
in
california...
at
significant
disadvantages
because
of
the
here
and
now
effect
of
this
law.
there
is
less
revenue
flowing
which,
in
the
california
democratic
party
has
spoken
for
itself.
you
have
that
in
the
record.
the
california
democratic
party
has
told
the
court,
respectfully
but
firmly,
that
they
depend
upon,
in
that
huge
state,
large
individual
contributions.
and
the
people
of
california...
this
is
not
just
one
party
speaking...
the
people
of
california
spoke
through
the
proposition
embraced
in
the
year
2000,
saying
political
parties
are
insulators
and
buffers.
they
are
guards
against
corruption.
that
is
a
very
pivotal
point
in
terms
of
the
shift...
i
thank
the
court.
