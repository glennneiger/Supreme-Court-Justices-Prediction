justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
starr,
may
i
ask
whether
you
are
attacking
prior
law
that
required
an
allocation?
it
didn't
say
that
the
state
parties
were
home
free.
it
did
say
when
there
were
mixed
activities,
there
had
to
be
an
allocation
and
in
presidential
election
years,
for
example,
that
was
heavily
weighted
on
the
federal
side.
was
that
in
your
view
constitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
don't...
i
don't
get
in
what
you
have
just
said
an
answer
to
a
question
which
would
affect
new
york,
would
affect
california,
would
affect
every
state,
65/35,
to
take
a
non-hypothetical
ratio
when
there
are
mixed
activities,
when
there
are
federal
and
state
candidates
on
the
ballot.
as
i
understand
the
prior
law,
it
didn't
count
how
many.
it
just
made
that
allocation.
was
that
constitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
to
the
extent
that
you
are
challenging,
your
challenge
is
based
on
the
first
amendment,
then
state
laws
that
are
similar
or
even
more
stringent
than
the
federal
law
would
also
form.
so
on
the
one
hand,
you're
saying
congress
paid
insufficient
attention
to
state
interests,
but
on
the
other
hand,
your
first
amendment
argument
would
require
significant
revision
of
some
state
laws.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
did
the
65
percent
[/]
35
percent
in
the
presidential
year
accommodate
state
interests?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
again,
mr....
mr.
burchfield,
when
i
come
back
to
the
question
i
asked
mr.
starr,
to
the
extent
that
you
are
relying
on
the
first
amendment,
you
can't
be
waiving
a
federalism
banner
because
that
would
affect,
you
spoke
about
some
state
laws
just
a
moment
ago,
i
think
you
mentioned,
connecticut--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--being
more
stringent
than
the
federal
regulation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
strictly
regulated
means
that
they,
in
order
to
raise
the
same
amount
of
money,
they
couldn't
rely
on
corporate
treasuries,
union
treasuries
and
rich
donors.
they
would
have
to
spread
their
effort
more
widely
to
reach
the
ordinary
people
who
support
a
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
it
would
cut
out
is
the
reliance
on
corporate
funds,
union
funds
and
wealthy
individuals.
the
parties
would
have
to
spread
their
efforts
more
widely,
but
that's
basically
what
it
calls
for.
there
is
no
limit,
there
is
no
ceiling
on
the
amount
of
the
money
that
they
could
raise.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
can't
receive,
how
can
you
solicit?
if
you
can't
receive,
how
can
you
transfer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
olson--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--one
feature
of
this
is
puzzling
to
me,
and
that
is
if
the
candidate
corruption
is
what,
or
the
officeholder
corruption
is
the
heart
of
it,
we
don't
want
candidates,
officeholders
to
be
bought,
then
why
did
congress,
why
was
congress
more
generous
to
candidates
and
officeholders
than
it
was
to
the
parties.
a
concrete
example.
a
candidate
for
federal
office
can
make
a
speech
at
a
fundraising
event
for
a
state
or
local
candidate,
if
i
read
the
statute
correctly,
but
an
officer
of
the
national
party
could
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
let
me,
let
me
add
to
that
that
the
same
thing
goes
for
contribution
to
a
501(c)
that
the
candidate
for
federal
office
can
make
that
solicitation,
but
not
an
officer
of
the
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
before
you
do,
do
you
have
an
answer
to
the
argument
put
to
general
olson
by
justice
breyer
that
if
you
don't
allow
the
parties
to
play
in
the
soft
money
league,
then
the
money
will
go
elsewhere.
it
will
go
to
the
independent,
sometimes
highly
ideological
groups.
it
will
go
to
the
nra,
for
example.
and
that
would
make
things
even
worse
than
they
are
now.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
waxman,
these
people,
these
independent
groups
make
independent
expenditures.
on
the
party
side,
once
a
candidate
has
been
nominated,
is
there
practically
any
such
thing
as
an
independent
expenditure,
as
opposed
to
a
coordinated
expenditure
by
a
party?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
also
recognize
that
express
advocacy
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
avoid?
you
just
say
everything
about
how
great
your
candidate
is
or
how
terrible
the
opponent
is,
accept,
and
go
to
the
polls
and
vote
for
x.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but,
but
buckley
was
dealing
with
two
words,
relative
to.
it
was
not
confronted
with
this
problem
as
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
couldn't
the
aclu
simply
call
its
pac
the
non-partisan
issue-oriented
pac?
if...
if
the
aclu
is
worried
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--misportraying
what
it's
doing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
he
couldn't
say,
our
political
purpose
is
to
be
non-partisan,
we
are
interested
in
the
issue,
not
the
candidate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mean
the
fec
would
say,
aclu,
sorry,
you
can't
do
that,
you
have
to
otherwise
identify
your
pac?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
they
get
an
advisory
opinion
from
the
fec
and
then
they
would
avoid
the
risk?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
in
the
middle
of
the
campaign.
they
could
do
it
any
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
they
want
to
clarify
what
they
have
to
say
about
their
pac,
to
make
it
clear
that
they
are
not
advocating
the
election
of
a
particular
candidate,
but
that
their
concern
is
at
issue--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
specifically
311.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
section
is
311
and
it
seems
to
me
to
require
virtually
the
identical
disclosure
that
305
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sekulow,
could
you
have
a
ban
at
any
age?
is
it
17
year
olds
that
ban
is
questionable.
but
say
the
congress
drew
the
line
at
8
or
10.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
posing
an
absolute
ban
on
contributions
by
10
and
under.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
just
want
to
be
clear
on
what
your
answer
is.
i
thought
you
said
that
there
would
be
a
line,
a
bright,
clear
line
that
could
be
drawn
at
some
age,
only
not
17.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sekulow,
you
said
in
your
brief
that
you
would
accept
even
a
severe
limitation,
but
not
an
absolute
ban,
so
among
severe
limitations,
would
it
be
constitutional
to
say,
yes,
16,
17
year
olds
can
give,
but
what
they
give
is
going
to
count
against
how
much
the
parent
or
parents
who
claim
the
child
as
a
dependent
can
give.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
just
wanted
to
know
what
you
meant
in
your
brief
by
you
would
accept
a
limitation,
even
a
severe
one.
is
this
one
that
you
would
accept?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
asking
you
about
establishing
proof
in
one
by
one
in
an
individual
case,
because
that
wouldn't
be
worth
anybody's
time.
could
the
law
say
it
will
count
against
the
parent
or
parents
who
take
the
child
as
a
deduction?
