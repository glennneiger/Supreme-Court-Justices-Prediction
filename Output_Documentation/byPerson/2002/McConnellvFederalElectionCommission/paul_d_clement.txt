mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
enacting
title
ii
of
the
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act,
congress
addressed
a
problem
that's
been
with
us
for
100
years,
the
corrosive
and
distorting
effects
of
aggregate
corporate
wealth
on
candidate
elections.
in
addressing
that
problem,
congress
did
not
adopt
a
revolutionary
approach,
rather,
title
ii
and
its
requirement
that
corporations
fund
electioneering
communications
through
a
separate
segregated
fund
simply
represents
a
contemporary
chapter
in
the
century-long
history
of
regulation
of
corporate
political
giving.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
there
is
no
question
that
corporations
are
very
good
at
aggregating
wealth
in
the
corporate--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
in
commerce,
and
the
concern--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
as
you
say,
congress
has
long
been
able
to
address
express
advocacy,
and
what
the
evidence,
the
overwhelming
evidence
before
the
district
court
showed
is
that
in
a
modern
political
campaign,
the
express
advocacy
test
no
longer
works.
it
no
longer
is...
it
is
a
woefully
inexact
proxy
for
the
kind
of
speech
that
affects
candidate
elections
that
this
court
has
said
corporations
must
make
through
segregated,
separate
segregated
fund.
this
court
has--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--first
of
all,
i
don't--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
it's
artificial
distinction.
in
any
event,
it's
not
a
distinction
i'm
drawing.
it's
a
distinction
that
this
court
drew
in
austin
when
it
distinguished
the
situation
it
had
before
it
in
belotti,
where
it
said
that
a
corporation
facing
an
absolute
ban,
not
a
separate
segregated
fund
requirement
but
an
absolute
ban
in
participating
in
a
referendum,
this
court
held
that
unconstitutional.
in
austin,
this
court
said
that
limits
on
express
advocacy
in
the
context
of
a
candidate
campaign
triggered
different
interests,
and
in
that
context,
congress
has
a
legitimate
ability
to
deal
with
the
corrosive
and
distorting
effects
of
aggregate
corporate
wealth
and
the
problems
with
diverting
shareholder
and
member
money
to
political
causes
with
which
they
disagree.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
there
are
certainly
ways
to
do
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
what
austin
represents
incorrectly
is
the
idea
that
when
corporate
money
is
being
aggregate
for
different
reasons,
that
there
is
an
interest
on
the
part
of
the
shareholders
not
to
have
that
money
diverted
to
political
causes
with
which
they
disagree.
now,
outside
of
the
corporate
context,
the
principle
that
you
are
advocating
certainly
applies.
individuals
are
able
to
advocate
unpopular
causes
with
their
money
and
that
is
not
a
concern
of
title
ii,
but
in
the
corporate
context
this
court
has
drawn
a
distinction,
and
that's
not
a
distinction
this
court
just
drew
in
the
austin
decision.
it's
one
that
goes
through
this
court's
decisions.
it
goes,
and
it
starts
really
from
the
tillman
act
in
1907
which
recognized
that
corporations
are
different.
corporations
posed
unique
risks
of
corruption,
so
in
1907,
corporations
and
corporations
alone
were
barred
from
making
contributions
to
candidates.
then
in
1947,
that
ban
was
extended
to
expenditures,
and
in
austin,
this
court
quite
correctly
held
up
that
as
constitutional
because
of
the
unique
risks
of
the
corporate
context
and
what
the
evidence
before
the
district
court
showed
is
all
of
those
same
interests
that
applied
in
austin
to
express
advocacy
equally
apply
to
these
kind
of
electioneering
communications.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
exactly
right.
that
is
safe,
justice
souter,
and
that's
why
all
of
the
evidence
before
the
district
court
that
looks
at
retrospective
ads
running
previous
cycles
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
that
one
of
the
virtues
of
the
clarity
with
which
title
ii
defines
electioneering
communications
is
that
a
corporation
can
avoid
the
trigger
and
that
similar
to
current
law,
under
current
law
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
nra
put
together
two
ads
in
the
2000
election
cycle.
they
were
virtually
identical,
except
one
of
them
finished
with
the
tag
line,
vote
for
bush.
now,
the
nra--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
let's,
justice
o'connor,
let's
take
the
mccain-feingold
provision,
for
example.
now,
first
of
all,
one
option,
of
course,
is
to
refer
to
it
the
way
i
have,
as
the
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act.
it's
important
to
remember,
however,
that
the
restrictions
in
this
bill
don't
restrict
any
corporation
from
talking
about
the
mccain-feingold
bill
in
48
states
or
in
fact
all
50,
as
long
as
senators
mccain
and
senator
feingold
are
not
up
for
election.
now,
at
the
point
that
somebody
wants
to
make
a
reference
to
the
mccain-feingold,
to
one
of
those
senators'
voters
in
the
immediate
days
running
up
to
the
election
then
they
may
not
be
referring
to
it
in
a
way
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
election.
they
may
be
referring
to
it
as
that
no
good
mccain-feingold
legislation,
and
it
may
clearly
have
an
electioneering
purpose.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kennedy,
we
start
from
the
same
proposition,
which
that
distinction
no
longer
holds
up
as
a
practical
matter
of
political
reality.
now,
i
fear
you
may
take
the
conclusion
from
that
that
we
should
just
end
this
whole
enterprise,
but
we
take
from
that
the
conclusion
that
congress
is
not
disabled
from
addressing
the
serious
problems
that
this
court
found
that
it
could
address
in
austin.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
so,
justice--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
it's
not,
justice
kennedy.
just
because
the
campaign
finance
laws
need
to
be
adjusted
from
time
to
time
doesn't
mean
there
are
no
limits
and
if
you
are
looking
for
a
limit
in
keeping
the
distinction
between
this
court's
decision
and
belotti
and
this
court's
decision
in
austin,
one
clear
limit
is
a
reference
to
a
candidate,
because
that
is
one
thing
that
clearly
identifies
an
ad
as
being
tied
to
the
interests
of
the
candidate
election
cycle.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
certainly
not,
justice
kennedy.
what
we
want
to
have
this
court
do
is
write
an
opinion
that
upholds
a
limitation
on
corporate
and
union
spending
from
direct
treasury
funds
that
reflects
the
current
reality.
i
can't
tell
you
whether
the
decision
that
you
would,
that
such
a
decision
upholding
this
legislation
would
still
work
25
years
from
now,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
it
will
work
in
the
near
term.
and
this
court
has
said,
for
example,
in
footnote
11
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life,
that
particularly
in
the
first
amendment
area,
congress
doesn't
have
to
anticipate
every
problem.
it
can
respond
to
the
observed
realities
and
the
observed
problems
before
it
and
try
to
address
those
and
that's
what
congress
did
with
this
provision.
as
you
say,
the
express
advocacy
test
no
longer
works.
the
candidates
themselves,
who
have
absolutely
no
regulatory
incentive
to
avoid
express
advocacy,
still
themselves
don't
make
reference,
don't
make
their
pleas
in
those
express
terms.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
all
respect,
justice
scalia,
that's
a
formula
for
surrender
in
response
to
what
is
clearly
a
problem
that
congress
has
been
wrestling
with
for
the
most
part
successfully
for
a
hundred
years,
which
is
the
corrosive
and
distorting
effects
of
corporate
wealth
on
candidate
elections.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
breyer,
the
simple
answer
is
you
were
right
all
along.
the
separate--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
separate
segregated
fund
requirement
is
not
an
undue
burden
on
corporate
political
activity.
this
is,
after
all,
not
the
first
case
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
separate
segregated
fund
requirement.
and
of
course
the
requirement
was
made
in
austin
as
well
that,
oh,
my,
if
we
have
to
use
the
separate
segregated
fund,
that
will
be
impossible.
the
court
rejected
that
argument
there
and
justice
brennan
in
his
concurrence
addressed
it
and
made
two
very
good
points.
first,
in
footnote
7,
he
said
that
that
just
doesn't
reflect
the
observed
reality,
that
the
michigan
chamber
of
commerce
there
was
very
successful
in
raising
funds
for
its
pac.
at
that
time,
success
was
measured
$140,000.
it
seems
quaint
because
what
this
record
says
is
that
the
nra
in
the
political
victory
fund
was
able
to
raise
$17
million
just
for
its
pac.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
that
was
a
concurrence
that
reflected
the
views
of
the
majority.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
they
didn't,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
that
it
is
certainly...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
binds
this
court
in
any
way.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
justice
brennan's
logic
in
addressing
that
problem
has
persuasive
force.
it
is
true
also
that
the
majority
opinion
of
justice
marshall
in
that
case,
also
noted,
described
the
michigan
chamber
of
commerce
in
that
case
as
being
quite
successful
in
its
pac.
and
also
specifically
said
in
the
majority
opinion
that
they
were
success
as...
to
the
tune
of
$140,000.
that
justice
brennan
amplified
that
point
in
his
concurrence.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
court
could
certainly
say
that,
justice
breyer,
and
i
think
should
say
that.
the
remarkable
thing
about
the
challenge
to
the
separate
segregated
fund
requirement
here,
if
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
gravamen
of
the
concern
seems
to
be
that
the
solicitation
restrictions
on
the
separate
segregated
fund
make
it
difficult
to
raise
enough
money.
now,
the
reason
i
find
that
so
surprising
is
there
was
a
direct
challenge
to
those
solicitation
requirements
before
this
court
in
the
national
right
to
work
committee
case.
and
this
court
unanimously
rejected
that
challenge.
so
the
solicitation
requirements
and
the
separate
segregated
fund,
which
by
the
way
were
not
changed
by
bcra
and
therefore
really
probably
aren't
even
jurisdictionally
before
this
court,
those...
if
somebody
has
a
problem
with
the
solicitation
requirements
either
on
their
face
or
as
applied,
that's
open
to
them
in
an
as-applied
challenge.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia,
the
consequence
is
entirely
speculative
on
this
record.
as
i
say,
some
groups
even
under
the
current
system
have
been
able
to
assemble
massive
amounts
of
money
in
their
political
action
committees.
and
that
is
remarkable
if
for
no
other
reason
that
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
it's
sort
of
no
reason
to
do
it
under
the
current
system,
because
one
of
the
main
reasons
to
put
money
in
your
political
action
fund
was
so
that
you
could
engage
in
express
advocacy
rather
than
issue
advocacy.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
scalia,
with
respect,
this
issue
is
no
different
than
the
parallel
issue
in
the
context
of
austin.
that
was
speech,
too.
that
was
a
burden
of
speech.
and
as
some
of
the
justices
pointed
out,
there
is
not
one
word
in
buckley
or
in
austin
that
suggests
that
express
advocacy
is
somehow
second
class
speech.
indeed,
there
is
no
higher
protected
speech
than
vote
for
bush
or
vote
for
gore,
yet
nonetheless,
the
restrictions
there
were
upheld
by
the
court
and
there
were
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--very
well,
justice
scalia,
but
i'll
take
the
five
to
four.
and
many
of
the
arguments
that
are
being
raised
in
opposition
to
this
statute
are
the
arguments
of
the
dissenters
in
austin,
not
the
arguments
of
the
majority
opinion
in
austin.
and
i
think
that's
an
important
point.
this
court
has
approved
the
same
basic
mechanism
in
the
context
of
express
advocacy.
it
has
worked
well
perhaps
not
with
the
definition
of
express
advocacy,
but
has
worked
well
in
terms
of
the
separate
segregated
fund
requirement.
the
other
point
i
think
that
has
to
be
made
about
the
separate
segregated
fund
requirement
is
that
the
idea
that,
okay,
let's
say
that
we
now
have
meaningful
limits
so
there
are
going
to
be
some
real
incentives
to
put
some
money
in
your
political
action
committee
or
your
separate
segregated
fund.
one
of
two
things
can
happen.
with
some
organizations,
it
may
very
well
turn
out
that
some
of
the
people
who
were
members
of
the
overall
organization,
turns
out
they
really
weren't
100
percent
interested
in
supporting
the
political
causes
of
that
organization.
they
sort
of
like
some
of
the
other
benefits
of
membership.
and
in
that
case,
the
amount
of
money
that
would
be
raised
will
be
reduced.
in
some
other
organizations,
it
may
be
that
every
member
of
the
organization
supports
the
political
cause
and
they
give
the
money
to
the
separate
segregated
fund.
in
either
event,
the
purposes
of
the
separate
segregated
fund
are
fully
vindicated
because
the
resulting
corporate
political
activity
at
that
point
will
reflect
the
views
of
the
underlying
membership
and
the
underlying
union
members,
which
is
precisely
what
this
court
said
was
a
compelling
interest
in
austin.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there
is
certainly
a
large
body
of
state
law
about
corporate
waste
that
is,
if
i
remember
it
from
law
school,
fairly
impenetrable
and
doesn't
provide
a
lot
of
specific
guidance
in
particular
consequences,
in
particular
cases.
but
i
would
say
that
that
same
issue
again
was
raised
in
austin,
and
this
court
said
that
it
was
not
sufficient
simply
to
leave
everything
to
the
state
law
of
waste,
where
you
have
the
business
judgment
rule,
and
everything's
set
up
to
make
sure
that
no
corporation
is
ever
held
liable.
this
court
said
that
in
this
particular
context,
it
was
much
more
appropriate
to
use
the
separate
segregated
fund
requirement
which
has
been
part
of
the
law
and
functionally
since
1947--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
again,
justice
scalia,
the
resort
i
would
take
is
to
the
austin
decision,
which
rejected
that
argument
as
well.
and
it
did
so
on
the
basis
that
candidate
elections
are
different
than
other
situations.
it
may
be
a
bit
of
an
affront
for
a
shareholder
to
have
their
money
spent
on
an
issue
that
they
don't
particularly
care
for,
or
to
have
the
corporation
go
into
some
new
line
of
business
that
the
shareholder
thinks,
boy,
that's
really
not
very
smart,
you
should
stick
with
what
you
know
best.
that's
an
affront.
but
it's
a
much
greater
affront
to
have
that
individual's
money
spent
on
candidate
elections
where
that
individual
does
not
agree
with
the
position
that
the
corporation
has
taken.
and
let
me
just
add--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
thought
that's
the
position
you
were
taking
earlier,
because
i
think
there
is
a
sense
in
which
any
time...
if
you're
talking
about
ads
within
60
days
from
election
that
are
targeted
to
a
candidate's
home
district
then
i
think...
and
mention
that
candidate,
i
think
it's
a
safe
assumption
to
be
made
that
they
at
least
have
a
mixed
motive.
and
one
of
the
motives
is
to
influence
the
candidate
election.
and
i
think
if
the
corporate
consciously
decides
to
link
its
issue
up
to
a
candidate
election,
then
it's
a
perfectly
appropriate
response
to
make
that
corporation
funded
through
a
separate
segregated
fund.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right.
and
this
court
took
a
different
step
over
the
chief
justice,
among
others'
dissents
and
said
no,
we're
going
to
invalidate
that
traditional
approach.
but
then
in
austin,
this
court
drew
an
important
distinction
between
the
candidate
election
context
and
the
issue
context.
i
was
talking
a
minute
ago
about
the
mixed
motives
and
i
did
want
to
be
responsive
to
a
question
that
justice
souter
had
asked
earlier,
which
is
this
question
about
in
the
specific
studies
that
congress
and
the
district
court
discussed,
was
mixed
motive
an
option
for
the
people
that
were
scoring
the
ads.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
not.
the
students
were
asked
whether
or
not
the
issue
in
the
particular
ad
had
a
tendency
to
support
or
go
against
a
candidate,
or
if
it
addressed
an
issue.
there
was
no
mixed
motive
box,
and
i
think
the
net
effect
of
that
is
that
whatever
overbreadth
is
estimated
by
the
studies,
it
actually
overstates
the
overbreadth
because
it
didn't
account
for
the
mixed
motive
case.
and
as
i
say,
i
think
the
mixed
motive
case
does
reflect
the
reality
in
a
number
of
situations.
but
i
do
think
that
the
point
that
a
corporation
makes
that
conscious
decision
to
link
some
controversial
issue
to
a
candidate
election,
at
that
point,
the
interest
that
this
court
found
sufficient
in
austin
are
fully
implicated.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
again,
and
the
safe
harbors
that
we
talked
about
earlier
are
still
available
in
that
situation.
and
they
are,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
twofold.
one,
if
all
the
corporation
is
really
concerned
about
is
a
pending
legislative
issue,
it
doesn't
need
to
make
a
reference
to
the
candidate
and
it
can
run
the
issue
through
treasury
funds.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
want
to
make
a
specific
reference
to
the
candidate,
tie
that
legislative
issue
to
the
broader
context
of
the
campaign,
then
they're
free
to
do
so
as
long
as
they
do
so
through
their
separate
segregated
fund.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
first
of
all,
justice
scalia,
as
i
understand
the
media
exemption,
it
applies
to
the
media
corporation
but
not
necessarily
to
the
entire
corporation,
so
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
know
about
that.
what
i
do
know
is
that
media
corporations
are
exempted
for
the
same
reason
they've
always
been
exempted
from
the
law,
which
is
that
they
do
pose
a
different
situation,
a
difference
of
kind.
and
this
court--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
mean,
i
think
the
traditional
role
of
media
companies
has
been
quite
different
than
the
traditional
role
of
other
companies.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
know.
i've
been
focused
on
this
area
for
the
last
couple
of
weeks,
justice
kennedy,
and
the
case
that
comes
to
mind
is
austin,
where
the
michigan
statute
before
this
court--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
love
austin.
it's
binding
precedent.
i
don't,
i
mean,
as
much
as
the
plaintiffs
don't
seem
to
like
the
case,
i
don't
really
hear
them
asking
this
court
to
overrule
it.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
know
it
is,
justice--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes.
i
don't
think
that
particular
provision--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
but
it
was
brought
into
full
focus
in
the
austin
case,
and
the
argument
was
made
there,
as
it's
made
here,
that
the
statute
is
somehow
underinclusive
because
it
doesn't
include
media
corporations,
and
i...
it
is
a
difficult
issue,
i
will
admit,
but
i
think
this
is
an
area
where
sometimes
it
is
just
as
much
a
problem
to
treat
different
entities
the
same
as
it
is
to
treat
similar
entities
differently.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
the
difference
is
that
because
of
the
traditional
role
of
what
a
media
corporation
does,
there
is,
there's
an
inherent
involvement
in
the
political
process.
this
court
recognized
that,
i
think
at
least
implicitly
in
mills
against
alabama,
when
you
had
a
situation
where
there
was
an
effort
to
apply
a
statute
to
a
newspaper,
and
i
think
because
of
the
role
of
the
media,
there
is
a
recognition
that
a
different
rule
should
apply
to
the
media,
and
again,
this
is...
this
is
no
revolution
in
the,
in
the
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act.
this
is
just
carrying
through--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
there
certainly
is
the
similarity
in
the
sense
that
they're
both
addressing
the
same
issue,
but
i
do
think
that
again
this
court
has
drawn
that
distinction
in
the
austin
case
and
congress
has
drawn
that
distinction
throughout
its
campaign
finance
reform.
this
is
not
some
new
provision.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
the
under--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--oh,
absolutely
they
can,
and
i
think
if
what
you're
talking
about
is
running
an
issue
about
the
slanted
press,
i
can't
imagine
how
that
has
to
refer
to
a
candidate,
so
i
think
you
come
within
both
safe
harbors
that
are
available
to
corporations.
they
could
do
it
through
a
separate
segregated
fund,
but
again,
if
what
a
corporation
wants
to
do
is
correct
some
nasty
publication
that's
been
running
some
media
corporation,
they
are
perfectly
free
to
do
that
with
treasury
funds
and
it's,
it's
harder
for
me
to
imagine
how
that
would
be
translated
into
the
context
of
a
candidate
election.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't.
i
know
there
are
cases
that
address--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
this
court
has
talked
in
various
cases,
mills
against
alabama
is
one,
about
the
freedom
of
the
press,
and
suggesting
maybe
that
adds
something,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
a
case
that
draws
that
definitive
distinction,
but
again,
this
is
a
little
bit
different.
this
is
not
saying
that
the
freedom
of
the
press
clause,
although
that
has
been
raised
in
this
litigation
obliquely,
that
the
freedom
of
press
clause
is
what
makes
the
difference.
what
makes
the
difference
here
is
a
legitimate
decision
by
congress
to
treat
these
different
corporations
differently,
and
again,
i
know
you
don't
want
to
hear
me
say
it,
but
the
austin
court
heard
the
argument,
it
said
that
that
argument
is
invalid.
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
think
that's
exactly
right.
it
reflects
that
historical
tradition.
it
also
reflects
the
reality
that
applying
this
kind
of
limitation
to
the
press
would
make
it
very
difficult
for
them
to
report
anything.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
that
can't
be
done,
and
in--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'm
sure
that
law
would
be
challenged.
there
might
be
a
defense
that
you
could
try
to
make
on
the
law,
but
the
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
i
think
that
this
effort
is
just
another
effort
to
say
that
congress
is
powerless
in
this
field,
because
all
the
problems
you
are
raising
about
electioneering
communication
and
how
you
treat
the
press
differently
apply
a
fortiori
i
to
express
advocacy.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
what
you
are
saying
is
that
contrary
to
this
court's
decisions
in
austin,
in
mcfl,
in
all
the
corporate,
in
all
the
cases
dealing
with
contributions,
that
the
first
amendment
holds
the
congress
powerless
to
deal
with
this
problem.
and
that
is
what
this
court's
cases
say.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
what
would
be
an
astounding
proposition
is
in
light
of
the
100-year
tradition
of
congress'
ability
to
regulate
the
influence
of
corporate
political
activity
and
corporate
influence
on
political
elections
if
all
they
can
do
is
limit
express
advocacy
or
as
i
understand
some
members
of
this
court,
they
can't
even
do
that.
that
is
a
very
difficult
position
to
swallow
because
congress
has
been
active
in
this
field
since
1907.
the
abuses
that
they
are
addressing
today
are
not
different
in
kind
from
the
abuses
they
have
addressed
for
the
past
100
years,
and
i
simply
don't
think
that
they
are
powerless
to
deal
with
this
situation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
that's
a
very
good
point,
and
there
are
differences
with
respect
to
broadcast
media,
and
i
think
if
i
can
digress
for
a
minute
to
talk
about
some
of
the
other
provisions
like
section
305,
311,
and
504--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
with
respect
to
some
of
the
other
provisions,
504,
307,
i'm
sorry,
305
and
311,
i
do
think
that
this
court's
cases
suggesting
that
broadcast
media
are
subjected
to
a
different
regulatory
regime
remain
good
law,
and
i
think
that
there
is
certainly
enough
in
this
case
without
trying
to
revisit
red
lion
or
some
of
these
other
cases.
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
can
happen
in
this
case
and
one
of
the
unfortunate
by
products
of
the
en
masse
nature
of
the
way
this
case
is
litigated
is
that
you
look
at
some
of
the
provisions
that
are
dealing
with
a
very
different
type
of
speech,
and
then
you
get
to
section
504
and
you
take
a
look
at
the
broad
terms
that
congress
has
used
and
it's
easy
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
that's
an
impermissible
approach
and
those
words
are
too
broad,
but
that
ignores
the
reality
of
the
way
the
broadcast
industry
has
been
regulated.
that's,
after
all,
an
industry
that
continues
to
be
regulated
on
a
public
interest
standard.
in
cbs
against
fcc,
this
court
upheld
a
statute
that
required
individual
stations
to
give
reasonable
time
to
candidates
and
it's
within
that
background
that
a
provision,
the
kind
of
provisions
that
congress
added
to
section
504
are
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
in
the
cbs
case
that
the
court
specifically
addressed
the
scarcity
rationale.
it
may
well
have
been
building
on
prior
precedents,
though,
that
were
based
on
that.
one
other
point
i'd--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
that's
the
way
that
the
media
has
long
been
regulated,
which
is
to
say
that
with
respect
to
requests
for
candidate
advertisement,
with
requests
to
address
a,
quote,
controversial
issue
of
public
importance,
which
is
the
pre-existing
law,
nothing
added
by
bcra,
there
has
been
a
requirement
that
if
you
make
a
request
for
air
time,
that
the
station
do
some
record-keeping
in
conjunction
with
that
and
that's
exactly
what
504
carries
over.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
one
of
the
reasons,
justice
o'connor,
is
so
that
they
could
enforce
the
public
interest
standard,
which
has,
which
has
manifested
itself
not
only
in
the
fairness
doctrine,
but
also
with
the
idea
that
stations
have
to
give
appropriate
amounts
of
time
to
things
like
discussion
of
legislative
issues.
and
so
if
you
have
the
requests
before
you,
you
can
then
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
one
station
is
denying
all
the
requests.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it
depends
on
which
provision
that
you
are
asking
about,
justice--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--in
504,
what
triggers
the
disclosure,
the
disclosure
requirements
is,
is
a
request
and
again--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'm
not
positive
about
this.
i
don't
think
that
section
504
has
that
kind
of
advance
notice
principle
to
it.
the
advance
notice
objections
that
have
been
raised
have
been
raised
to
sections
201
and
214,
and
i
think
with
respect
to
those
provisions,
it's
important
and
worthwhile
to
note
that
the
fc...
the
fec
has
cured
the
advance
notice
issue
by
regulation,
and
what
people
seem
to
have
focused
on
is
the
idea
that
the
statute
requires
the
disclosure
of
a
contract
to
disburse,
and
that
language
is
not
designed
to
get
at
advanced
disclosure
in
the
sense
of
advanced
disclosure
before
the
ad
airs.
it's
simply
to
get
away
with,
to
avoid
the
clear
circumvention
that
would
happen
if
somebody
could
buy
ads
on
credit
and
then
only
disclose
them
after
the
fact,
after
the
election
when
they
had
actually
made
the
disbursement
at
that
point.
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
mean,
i
think
that's
right,
but
again,
that
is
the
way
that
the
fec
has
interpreted
the
provisions,
which
is
to
say
there
is
no
advance
disclosure
requirement
under
201
and
214
as
interpreted
by
the
fec,
because
they
trigger
to
the
definition
of,
for
example,
in
201
the
electioneering
communication
and
you
don't
even
know
for
sure
that
it's
an
electioneering
communication
until
it's
in
fact
it
is
run
in
the
relevant
district
that's
been
targeted
and
all
the
like,
so
in
that
sense
i
do
think
that
the
fec
has
cured
any
problem
with
advance
notice.
i'm
not
sure
it
was
that
much
of
a
problem
in
any
event
because
what
you
are
talking
about
is
forcing
people
to
disclose
the
fact
that
they
made
binding
contracts.
i
think
it's
also--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--again--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
again,
what
contracts
to
makes
disbursement,
or
i
don't
know
what
language
you
have
in
front
of
you,
but
contracts
to
make
disbursement.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
again,
as
i
was
explaining
to
justice
o'connor,
that
provision
is
necessary
to
avoid
the
phenomenon
where
somebody
contracts
to
make
a
disbursement,
i.e.,
buys
an
ad
on
credit
and
doesn't
make
the
disbursement
until
after
the
ad
is
run
or
in
fact
after
the
election,
so
that's
why
that's
in
there.
it's
also
worth
noting
that
the
statute--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
con...
the
disclosure
provision.
i
suppose
if
you
buy
$10,000
worth
of
ads
on
credit
that
does
become
an
expenditure
the
second
you
make
that
credit
purchase,
but
i
don't
think
that
renders
a
statute
unconstitutional.
i
think
again
it
bears
noting
that
this
advance
sort
of
contract
to
purchase
language
has
been
in
the
statute
all
along.
it
was
in
feca
with
respect
to
expenditures.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
justice
souter
made
note
of
that
in
footnote
one.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
challenge
with
respect,
justice
scalia.
if
the
nature
of
the
challenge
that
a
provision
is
vague
and
in
fact
a
very
similar
provision
has
been
in
the
statute
for
20
years
and
the
regulated
parties
working
with
the
fec
in
the
context
of
504
have
figured
out
how
to
live
with
it
in
a
way
that
doesn't
have
any
chilling
effects,
then
i
think
the
fact
that
there
was
a
statutory
prerequisite
for
it
is
quite
important
and
is
valid
and
a
valid
basis
for
interpreting
the
statute.
if
i
may
say
in
closing
as
i
said
before,
i
think
the
counsel
of
the
other
side
in
this
case
is
that,
to
borrow
justice
scalia's
phrase,
this
problem
is
insoluble.
they
fully
admit
that
the
express
advocacy
test
doesn't
work.
i
think
it
is
not
a
proxy
for
speech
designed
to
influence
candidate
elections.
i
think
one
thing
we
can
trust
candidates
to
do
is
to
make
speeches
that
are
designed
to
influence
their
own
elections,
yet
almost
90
percent
of
candidates'
own
advertisements
don't
use
words
of
express
advocacy.
the
remarkable
thing
about
plaintiffs
here
is
that
in
the
first,
in
the
first,
this
morning
we
heard
a
little
bit
from
mr.
starr
about
less
restrictive
alternatives.
you
hear
not
one
word
about
that
this
afternoon
because
they
offer
nothing
as
an
alternative.
they
say
it's
express
advocacy
or
nothing,
and
they
are
all
too
willing
to
abandon
even
express
advocacy
and
i
simply
do
not
think
that
the
constitution
leaves
congress
powerless
to
deal
with
this
problem.
strict
scrutiny
is
not
