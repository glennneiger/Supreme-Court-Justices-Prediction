i'm
still
curious
about
the
response,
mr.
starr,
to
that
inquiry
about
whether
your
arguments
would
apply
and
lead
you
to
think
that
the
pre-bcra
regime
is
invalid
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
nothing
about
it
was,
the
allocation
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
would
your
argument
lead
you
to
conclude
that
maybe
that
scheme
that's
been
there
for
25
years
is
invalid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is,
is
there
evidence
in
the
record
of
access
corruption,
so
to
speak,
using
soft
money
to
fund
purely
state
and
local
elections,
as
opposed
to
federal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
evidence
of
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
i
understand,
evidence
that
the
money
being
used
to
fund
purely
state
and
local
election
activities?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
ban
extends
to
that,
apparently?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
no
effective
regulation
of
electioneering
communications
is
permissible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why...
why
did
they
ask
for
record
of
requests
as
opposed
to
actual
broadcast
deals?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
must
the
disclosure
be
made
before
the
ads
are
run?
it's
not
clear.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
talking
about
504.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
i
know.
but
i'm
asking
about
the
time
within
which
it
has
to
be
disclosed
by
the
broadcast
stations.
