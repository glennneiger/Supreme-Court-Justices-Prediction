mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
before
the
court
in
connection
with
title
i
and
the
rest
of
this
legislation
raise
the
most
fundamental
challenge
for
any,
for
any
representative
democracy.
it's
a
challenge
that
this
court,
beginning
at
least
with
justice
frankfurter
and
the
united
auto
workers
case
and
extending
through
this
court's
opinion
in
shrink
missouri
and
beaumont,
has
recognized
that
is
the
imperative
of
a
representative
democracy
to
retain
the
confidence
of
the
individual
citizens
with
whom
we
all
share
the
franchise,
that
their
vote
counts,
that
big
money
doesn't
call
the
tune,
and
that
when
members
of
the
congress
and
the
president
and
vice
president
make
decisions
on
our
behalf,
they
do
so
because
they
think
it
is
in
the
best
interest
of
their
country
and
our
judgment
as
constituents
and
their
own
judgment.
and
there
was
reference
paid,
reference
made
to
the
testimony
of
members
of
this,
of
congress,
respected
members
like
senator
simpson
and
senator
rudman,
and
it
is
very
important
to
focus
on
what
those
senators
said
under
oath.
when
senator
simpson
testified,
he
testified
that
too
often,
members'
first
thought
is
not
what
is
right,
or
what
they
will
believe,
but
how
it
will
affect
fundraising.
who,
after
all,
can
seriously
contend
that
a
$100,000
donation
does
not
seriously
alter
the
way
one
thinks
about
and
quite
possibly
votes
on
an
issue?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
he
was...
his
declaration
is,
his
sworn
declaration
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
first
volume.
he
was
speaking
in
general
and
about
all
of
us,
and
so,
too,
was
senator
rudman
when
he
testified
under
oath
that
large
soft
money
contributions
distort
the
legislative
process
because
they
affect
whom
senators
and
house
members
see,
whom
they
spend
their
time
with,
what
input
they
get,
and
make
no
mistake
about
it,
this
money
affects
outcomes
as
well,
and
millions--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
was,
there
was
a
concession
in
this
case
that
give,
that
there
is
no
specific
evidence
that
a
particular
vote
was
changed
because
of
a
particular
donation,
but
of
course,
that,
too,
was
not
true
in
buckley
v.
valeo.
buckley
v.
valeo,
this
court
made
reference
to
the
findings
of
the
d.c.
circuit
which
dealt
exclusively
with
excess
access
by
the
milk
producers
and
others
and
ambassadorships
and
the
record
in
this
case
so
overwhelms
the
record
before
this
court
in...
in
fact,
it
overwhelms
by
several
orders
of
magnitude
the
factual
records
that
existed
in
buckley
and
all
of
its
progeny.
now,
justice--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
certainly
doesn't
mean
they're
going
to
vote
that
way,
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
testimony--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
giving...
this
court
has
said
that
corruption
in
the
buckley
sense
is
the
influence
of
large
donations
on
the
judgment
and
behavior
of
officeholders,
and
justice
scalia,
there
is
a
mountain
of
evidence
from
experts,
members,
lobbyists,
60
pages
of
findings
from
judge
kollar-kotelly
and
almost
as
many
from
judge
leon
that
access
buys
influence,
and
there
are
any
number
of
ways
that
cannot
be
statistically
observed
to
change
outcomes
besides
a
particular
vote.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
you
can
go
back
and
overrule
buckley
v.
valeo,
and
every
other
one
of
these
cases
you
have
decided
because
that
has
never
been
proven.
it
is
very
difficult
to
prove,
and
what
cong...
what
congress
needs
to
aim
at,
it
needs
to
aim
at
the
willingness
of
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
out
there
who
think
that
their
vote
counts
and
think
that
members
of
congress
will
be
responsive
to
them
and
who
are
justifiably
cynical
when
they
see
that
in
the
last
presidential
election,
$500
million
that
law
does
not
permit
to
be
used
for
federal
election
purposes
was
used
for
that
purpose
as
the
political
party's
own
expert,
professor
la
raja
acknowledged
that
it
almost
all
was
used
for
federal
election
purposes.
this
goes
right
to
the
question,
it
goes
right
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
state
parties
and
i
think
the
chief
justice's
question
about
the
national
ban,
and
i'd
like
to
address
those
first.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
i
have,
i
have
several
questions
and
that,
that
was
my,
the
next
point
i
was
going
to
address
after
the
first
two,
which
is,
it
is
wrong
on
about
10
different
levels,
but
the
bottom
line
is
if
it
turns
out
to
be
an
abuse,
that
is,
if
it
turns
out
to
be
a
phenomenon
that
creates
corruption
as
this
court
defined
it,
either
in
the
case
of
individual
contributions
in
buckley
or
through
corporate
and
labor
union
for
the
principles
that
were
articulated
by
this
court
in
national
right
to
work
and
austin
and
about
which
we'll
be
visiting
this
afternoon,
congress
can
take
care
of
the
problem.
the
one
thing
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
one
thing
that
we
know
for
certain,
justice
scalia,
in
this
uncertain
world,
there
is
at
least
one
thing
that
is
certain,
and
that
is
that
the
people
who
enacted
bcra
and
the
people
who
populate
the
house
and
senate,
if
they
find
that
the
national
political
parties
are
being
disadvantaged
or
losing
their
central
role,
not
only
in
our
political
system,
but
in
our
system
of
governance,
they
will
be
there
to
address
it.
general
olson--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--to
be
sure,
justice
kennedy,
and
if
it
were
impaired,
congress
could
and
would
address
it.
the
data
already
shows
that
this
year
the
parties
have
raised
more
in
hard
money
alone
than
they
raised
in
the
last
presidential
election
in
hard
and
soft
money,
and
they
are
right
on
a
trajectory
to
raise
$1.5
billion
in
hard
money
for
all
of
their
activities.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
it,
my
argument
doesn't
depend
on
if
the,
the
parties,
of
course,
aren't
mentioned
in
the
constitution,
but
they
are
a
fundamental
aspect
of
our
system
of
representative
government,
and
i,
i
meant
to
cast
no
aspersions
on
the
fact
that
they
play
a
role
not
only
in
electing
candidates,
but
also
in
organizing
in
particular
the
legislative
process
and
the
conduct
of
legislative
business.
my
only
point
is
that
we
can
be
certain
that
if
something
comes
to
pass
that
our
experience
so
far
shows
is
not
going
to
come
to
pass,
congress
can
come
to
their
aid
or
someone
can
come
to
this
court,
but
the
fact--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
is,
there
is
no
question
that
the,
that
telling
the
national
committees
of
the,
the
national
committees
of
the
national
parties
that
you
are
now
required
to
accept
only
funds
that
are
subject
to
the
limitations,
restrictions,
and
reporting
requirements
of
the
federal
election,
federal
law
is
a
limitation
and
it
requires
them
to
accommodate
it.
i'm
only
saying
that
you
cannot
strike
this
law
down
on
its
face
based
on
a
chicken
little
prediction
that
something
that
by
all
accounts
is
not
happening
at
all
does
happen.
and
the
notion
that
corporate
and
union
money
is
just
going
to
flow
from,
these
corporations
that
gave
a
million
dollars
to
each
party
at
the
same
time,
is
going
to
flow
to
the
national
rifle
association
or
the
national
abortion
rights
league,
i
think
misstates
the
important
laudable
role
that
the
parties
play,
and
misstates
the
fact
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
that
those
contributions
were
strong-armed.
you
look
at
the
testimony
in
the
record
and
the
amicus
brief
of
the
business
officials,
these
people
were
not
dying
to
spend
millions
of
dollars
to
both
political
parties,
in
order
to
support
democracy.
and
the
notion
that
they
are
going
to
go
running
to
the
national
rifle
association
or
to
naral,
i
think
has
no
basis
in
the
record.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
true,
but
however
they
choose
to
use
their
shareholders'
resources,
i
think
is
up
to
the
democracy
of
shareholders.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
have
been
told
that
there
are
ways
to
read
this
court's
opinion
in
colorado
republican
i
and
ii,
to
limit
that
distinction.
that
is,
the
concept
of
an
independent
expenditure
to
the
one
which
the
court
was
presented,
which
is
a
circumstance
in
which
the
party,
in
that
case
the
colorado
republican
party,
didn't
have
a
nominee.
and
therefore,
it
was
rather
difficult
for
it
to
be
coordinating.
but
i
believe
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
correct.
and
this
does
go
to
the
point
that
the
chief
raised
and
justice
o'connor
raised
about
323(a)
and
323(b)
that
i
hope
i
will
be
able
to
address.
on
the
state
parties,
you've
heard
the
quote
from
mr.
burchfield.
he
was
simply
stating
the
obvious
which
is,
we
are
talking
here,
as
the
act
defines
it,
about
national
parties
that
organize
themselves
in
national
committees,
state
committees
and
local
committees.
and
all
of
those
parties,
all
of
those
committees
act
together
to
elect
their
slate
of
candidates.
and
it
is
my
friends
on
the
other
side
of
this
case
and
not
us
that
demean
the
role
of
the
state
and
local
committees
by
essentially
attaching
their
activities
to
races
for
dogcatcher
and
state
assemblymen,
when
in
fact,
they
play
the
central
role
in
our
system
in
identifying,
grooming
and
supporting
candidates
for
federal
office.
the
candidate
on
the
ohio
ballot
for
republican
for
senate
is
nominated
and
placed
there
by
the
ohio
republican
party.
and
you
asked
about
the
tamraz
or
riatti
contributions
and
what
evidence
there
was
about
it.
the
evidence
is
that
if
323(b)
were
not
in
place,
that
is,
there
were
just
a
national...
the
national
committees
are
out
of
the
soft
money
business,
most
of
the
poster
children
in
the
thompson
committee
report,
mr.
riatti
in
'92,
mr.
tamraz,
carl
lindner,
the
hudson
indian
gaming
casinos.
all
of
the
greatest
hits
that
senator
thompson
came
up
with.
those
were
people
that
gave
money
to
the
state
and
local
parties
in
exchange
for
benefits
that
they
perceived
from
federal
officeholders.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
to
be
sure.
and
my
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
to
understand
why
mr.
burchfield
was
correct
in
saying
that
this
problem,
this
massive
loophole
had
to
address
the
state
and
local
committees,
you
need
to...
it
simply
reflects
the
reality
that
those
committees,
at
least
before
they
became
under
the
big
soft
money
regime,
what
one
expert
called
offshore
banks
of
the
national
committees,
they
play
a
very
important
role
in
selecting
who
are
going
to
be
the
federal
candidates.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
as
to
the
former,
we
don't
think
that
the
contribution,
the
soft
money
contribution
ban
is
subject
to
strict
scrutiny,
and
therefore,
the
fact
that
there
may
be
some
other
way
to
sort
of
carve
out
money
that's
given
to
the
national
committee
purely
for
state
elections
is
a
constitutional
deficiency.
but
the
argument...
the
complicated
point
that
mr.
burchfield
was
making
about
how
the
levin
amendment
works
was
simply
mistaken.
it
was
mistaken
in
several
respects.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
prohibition...
first
of
all,
the
levin
amendment
is
an
option.
if
each
state
and
local
committee
doesn't
want
to
have
it,
they
don't
have
to
use
it.
and
if
they
do
use
it,
nothing
prevents
them
from
spending
it
together.
they
just
can't
transfer
money,
this
soft
levin
money,
from
one
committee
to
another
to
essentially
recreate
the
problem
that
existed
before,
which
is
phenomenal
amounts
of
soft
money
all
being
transferred
to
a
few
battleground
elections.
this
is
important.
a
national
committee
official
may...
and
the
fec
has
confirmed
this
repeatedly...
may
in
his
official
capacity,
under
the
stationery
of
the
national
committee,
solicit
funds
up
to
the
hard
money
limits
for
any
state
and
local
candidate
or
any
state
and
local
committee.
that
is,
it
is
simply
false
that
a
member
of
the
republican
national
committee
cannot
raise
$25
to
support
haley
barbour's
candidacy.
they
can.
and
they
can
do
it
in
their
official
capacity
up
to
the
hard
money
limits
into
an
account
that
haley
barbour...
a
federal
account
that
haley
barbour
has
set
up
and
would
need
to
set
up
in
any
event
under
323(f)
and
323(b).
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
this
is...
yes.
this
is
hard
money.
and
in
fact,
the
national
committees,
even
for
a
local
committee
that's
chosen
to
use
the
levin
soft
money,
the
law
permits
the
national
committees
to
send
hard
money
to
that
local
committee,
provided
it
is
not
the
money
that
creates
the
specific
match
for
the
allocation.
and
the
notion
that...
a
wedge
is
driven
in
the
midst
that
sort
of
creates
a
rift
in
this
integrated
national
organization
is
simply
wrong.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
the
homegrown...
the
so-called
homegrown
requirement...
i
realize
the
levin
amendment
provisions
are
technical.
there
is
a
reason
that
you
are
not
allowed
to
do
that,
and
that
goes
again
to
the
point--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
not
homegrown.
and
it
goes
to
the
point
about
why
there
couldn't
be
or
perhaps
why
didn't
congress
just
say
let's
create
a
separate
account
for
the
national
committees,
which
is
that
the
people
who
gave
these
huge
contributions,
the
corporations
and
unions,
did
not
care
where
it
went.
they
cared
what
it
bought
them.
and
the
notion
that
if
a
member
of
the
national...
if
terry
mcauliffe
comes
to
somebody
and
says,
we
really
need
$6
million,
it's
just
going
to
be
used
for
state
and
local
elections,
but
we
really
need
it,
that
just
recreates
the
problem
that
congress
was
trying
to
address.
now,
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in
the
course
of
that
rambling
discourse,
i
answered
your
question
about
the
national
ban.
but
if
i
didn't,
i
would
love
to
address
myself
to
it.
you
asked,
justice
scalia,
at
the
outset,
is
every
problem
soluble.
and
the
answer...
i
hope
that
was
a
rhetorical
question.
in
any
event,
this
problem--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
believe
it
is,
but
out
of
respect
for
the
court
and
in
an
effort
to
be
responsive,
i
won't
treat
it
as
such.
no
problem
is
solvable
and
as
this
court's
jurisprudence
shows
in
this
area,
no
solution
is
permanently
solvable.
we
have
a
dialectic
going
on
here
between
people
who
want
to
use
money
to
influence
people
in
government,
and
the
institutions
that
need
to
preserve
a
sense
of
integrity
and
faith
in
the
process.
and
what
my
colleagues
on
the
other
side
are
urging
here...
there
has
been
a
lot
of
debate
about
the
sort
of
capillaries
of
the
system,
but
very
little
talk
about
the
core
of
it.
what
they
are
urging
is
that
this
law
be
struck
down
on
its
face.
and
that
is
a
counsel
of
despair,
and
that
is
an
approach
that
this
court
and
this
congress
and
this
people
cannot
countenance.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
buckley
v.
valeo
taught
not
that
the
so-called
magic
words
test
was
a
constitutional
immutable.
it
taught
two
lessons
that
are
much
more
enduring,
that
are
profound,
and
that
demonstrate
just
exactly
why
the
electioneering
communications
definition
and
provision
is
constitutional.
the
first
thing
that
buckley
taught
in
this
area
is
that
statutory
requirements
that
cut
right
through
core
political
speech,
nothing
more
core
than
vote
for
bush
or
bush
is
a
good
guy
the
day
before
the
election.
statutory
requirements
in
this
area
must
be
clear,
they
must
be
illusive
so
that
they
will
not,
as
this
court
said,
quote,
dissolve
impractical
application.
no
doubt
about
this
case.
no
one
on
the
other
side
has
suggested
that
there
is
any
lack
of
clarity
in
this
objective
test.
the
second
test,
the
second
factor
that
this
court
articulated
in--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
sorry,
the
four-part
primary
definition,
that
is,
it
has
to
be
at
60
days
before,
targeted
at
the
electorate,
a
specifically
identified
candidate
in
an
ad
that
is
broadcast
as
opposed
to
an
ad
that
runs
in
a
newspaper.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the
fec
took
comments
on
whether
or
not
it
covered,
for
example,
the
mccain-feingold
regulation
or
roth
ira.
and
it
has
ruled.
it
considered
whether
or
not
an
ad
that
is
run
within
the
period
but
says
call
your
congressman
and
has
the
congressman's
name
without
identifying
him
by
name
is
covered,
and
it
ruled
that
it
did.
now,
those
applications...
one
of
those
applications,
that
is,
the
call
your
congressman,
my
clients,
the
sponsor
of
this
bill,
urged
the
court
to
the
urge
the
fec
to
adopt.
it
didn't
because
it
found
that
there
were
possibilities
for
circumvention
and
not
an
established
record
to
demonstrate
that
it
would
cause
a
problem
in
any
number
of
cases.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
second
test,
the
lesson
that
buckley
teaches
that
is
enduring
is
that
standards
in
this
area
must
be,
quote,
directed
precisely
to
that
spending
that
is
unambiguously
related
to
the
campaign
of
a
particular
federal
candidate.
and
so
many
we
are
talking
about
whether
or
not
this
law
is
overbroad
or
substantially
overbroad,
i
suggest
that
the
court
look
to
the
standard
that
it
articulated
itself
in
buckley,
which
is
are
these
expenditures
for
communications
that
are
unambiguously
campaign
related.
and
if
the
answer
is
yes,
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
then
on
its
face,
the
statute
deserves
to
stand.
there
may
be
particular
applications
that
may
be
in
fact
unconstitutional.
the
fec
can
issue
rules,
as-applied
challenges--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
district
court
struck
down
the
primary
definition
and
upheld
an
altered
version
of
the
backup
definition,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
it
did
so,
based
on
its
understanding
and
it
was
a
misunderstanding
of
what
the
data
showed
with
respect
to
the
answer
that
was
given
to,
i
think
it's
question
6
in
the
buying
time
study.
that
is,
our
data
that
showed
that
for
one
of
the
two
years
involved,
14.7
percent
of
the
ads,
which
constituted
a
total
of
six
ads,
were
issue-related,
not
candidate-related.
this
is
the
binary
choice.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
fact,
judge
leon,
who
was
the
swing
vote,
so
to
speak,
specifically
found
that
although
there
had
been
some
criticisms
with
respect
to
the
methodology
with
respect
to
this
one
question,
he
specifically
found
that
the
buying
time
study
was
credible,
and
that
the
results
should
be
given
credence.
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
his
interpretation
of
the
answer
to
that
one
question
that
he
determined
that,
well,
this
is
14.7
percent
or
17
percent
and
that's
overbroad.
and
what
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
is
why...
first
of
all,
that
analysis
was
incorrect.
but
more
to
the
point,
even
if
there
never
had
been
a
buying
time
study,
even
if
this
question
was
never
asked,
congress
had
more
than
ample
justification
for
doing
this.
one
of
the
wonderful
things
about
a
bright
line
objective
test
is
it
invites
hypotheticals.
but
what
congress
had
before
it,
which
is
in
strict
scrutiny,
after
all,
what
we're
addressing
ourselves
to,
was
the
real
world.
and
it
had
before
it...
this
is
defense
exhibit
48
in
the
record
below...
the
story
boards
of
all
of
the
ads
that
were
captured
by
the
cmag
database.
that
is,
in
the
75
largest
media
markets
in
the
11
months
that
led
up
to
the
1998
campaign
and
the
2000
campaign.
and
we
urge
the
court
to
look
through
this
volume
because
the
real
world
of
what
these
ads
were
does
not
reflect
the
hypothetical
instances
in
which
a
corporation
or
a
labor
union
is
faced
with
an
imminent
piece
of
legislation
that's
going
to
be
enacted
the
week
before
or
the
week
after
an
election
and
it's
only
about
changing
votes.
there
may
very
well
be
instances,
if
that
occurs,
in
which
an
as-applied
challenge
can
be
made
and
a
court
can
determine
whether
or
not
the
law
can
constitutionally
be
applied
to
that.
but
what
is
an
amazing
feature
about
this
case
is
the
remarkable
degree
to
which
the
four-part
objective
test
that
congress
drew
actually
hits
the
observed
reality
of
what
congress
knew
these
ads
were
about.
at
page
11a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
we've
reprinted
a
chart
that
is
also
contained
in
judge
kollar-kotelly's
findings
at
special
appendix
page
848.
and
what
the
chart
shows
is
a
graph
that
shows,
over
the
course
of,
i
believe
it's
2000.
this
was
2000.
yes.
weeks
prior
to
the
2000
election.
if
you
look
at
the
dotted
line
which
sort
of
waves
back
and
forth
very
close
to
the
bottom
axis,
those
are
the
number
of
ads,
issue
ads,
run
during
2000
that
don't
mention
candidates.
it
stays
very
constant
throughout
the
year.
if
you
look
at
the
hard
line,
you'll
see
an
enormous
spike
that
comes
right
about
week
9,
nine
weeks
before.
that's
63
days
before
the
election.
and
what
congress
found
was
that
there
was
substantial
evidence,
both
the
ads
themselves
and
through
objective
data
that
i'm
now
going
to
describe,
that
what
common
sense
leads
you
to
believe,
that
is,
that
ads
that
run
just
before
an
election,
that
mention
a
candidate
that
are
targeted
at
that
candidate's
election,
and
that
use
broadcast
media,
that
is
the
most
expensive
kind
of
media
possible,
are
very
likely
intended
to
have,
and
overwhelmingly
likely
will
have,
an
effect
on
an
election.
now,
justice
scalia,
you're
quite
right.
you
know,
the
hip
bone
is
connected
to
the
thigh
bone
which
is
connected
to
the
knee
bone,
and
that
doesn't
mean
you
can
regulate
the
metatarsals.
but
we're
talking
about
a...
what
a
terrible
metaphor.
we're
talking
about
a
test
here
that...
we're
talking
the
test
is
spending
that
is
unambiguously
related
to
a
campaign.
and
what
congress
found,
based
on
the
ads,
is
that
that
was
the
case.
and
if
you
don't
want
to
read
through
all
of
these
direct
ads,
just
look
at
the
ones
that
the
plaintiffs
have
attached
to
their
brief.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
absolutely
not.
and
that
is
not
the
reason
that...
there
is
a
lot
of
talk
about
attack
ads.
but
the
reality
is
they
didn't
ban
attack
ads
and
they
didn't
even
ban
attack
ads
by
corporations
and
labor
unions
and
nonprofits.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
correct.
there
were
individual
statements
by
members
of
congress
who
were
upset
about
this.
but
if
you
look
at
the
test
that
congress
crafted,
and
the
fact...
and
it
is
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
vast
majority
of
these
ads
were
attacking
not
incumbents.
the
vast
majority
of
these
ads
were
attacking
challengers.
i
don't
think
it's
fair--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
these
ads...
there
are
ads
here
that
both
attack
and
praise.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
my
point
to
justice
kennedy
was,
by
and
large,
the
incumbents
made
out
very
well
under
the
status
quo
ante.
and
it
is...
justice
scalia--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
purpose
of
the
legislation,
and
it
is
manifest,
we
included
it
in
an
appendix
in
our
brief,
and
it's
in
the
thompson
committee
report
and
the
page
is
cited
by
senator
thompson's
amicus
brief,
is
that
congress
was
closing
a
loophole.
it
was
closing
a
loophole
that
the
political
director
of
the
national
rifle
association
called
a
line
in
the
land
drawn
on
a
windy
day.
she
said
that
the
express
advocacy
test
was
a
wall
built
of
the
same
sturdy
material
as
the
emperor's
clothing.
everyone
sees
it.
no
one
believes
it.
it
was,
in
other
words,
serving
the
paramount
interest
in
reducing
a
provision
of
law,
a
provision
of
law
enacted
by
congress
following
this
court's
decision
in
buckley
that
had
made
the
law
an
object
of
scorn.
and
that
is
all
over
the
record
in
this
case.
that
what
this
was
about
was
replacing
a
line
in
the
sand
drawn
on
a
windy
day
with
a
line
that
everybody
can
see
and
that
no
one
would
miss.
and
the
evidence
before
congress
was
not
just
this
question
6,
but
the
ads
themselves,
the
way
they
ran.
there
are
statement
after
statement
after
statement
from
witnesses
in
this
case
that
are
included
in
the
joint
appendix.
and
objective
studies
from...
the
objective
data
from
the
buying
time
studies,
the
annenberg
center,
professor
magleby
at
brigham
young
university.
and
the
internal
documents...
and
we
have
some
of
these
discussed
in
our
brief...
the
internal
documents
of
the
corporations
and
unions
that
ran
these
ads.
they
have
documents
that
showed
that
they
were
aiming
at
voters,
they
were
using
consultants
and
pollsters
to
try
and
figure
out
how
to
get
voters.
they
tested
these
against
voters.
these
were
electioneering
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
and
here
is...
just
to
put
some
reality,
i
guess,
the
real
world
example
behind
that
chart,
number
11a.
citizens
for
better
medicare
was
an
organization
that
ran
a
large
number
of
these
ads
in
2000.
described
itself
as...
its
official
web
site
as
a
group
of
concerned
seniors
and
companies
and
associations
concerned
about
medicare.
it
was
in
fact
funded
almost
exclusively
by
pharma
and
the
corporations
that
make
up
pharma.
nothing
wrong
with
them
running
issue
ads
at
all,
justice
scalia.
from
january
1
until
september
4,
that
is,
until
the
60-day
period
cut
in,
they
ran
23,867
issue
ads
about
medicare
and
not
a
single
one
mentioned
a
candidate.
on
september
4,
until
election
day,
they
ran
10,876
ads
all
mentioning
candidates.
and
on
election
day,
they
stopped
cold.
and
in
our
brief,
we
discuss
this
at
page
50
and
52.
that
is
a
particularly
striking
example
of
no
requirement
to
disclose
to
the
public
who's
paying
for
this
when
it
is,
in
fact,
corporate
treasuries.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
again,
justice
scalia--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i...
justice
scalia,
i'm
right
here
with
my
brother,
clement,
with
austin.
and
with
the
very
same
rationale
that
this
court
adopted
in
austin,
which
was
explicated
in
the
auto
workers
case
by
justice
frankfurter,
which
was
recited
again
by
a
unanimous
opinion
of
the
court
in
national
right
to
work
committee.
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not,
when
we're
talking
about
campaign-related
speech,
when
we
are
talking
about
who
gets
to
speak
when
individual
citizens
are
exercising
their
constitutional
franchise
to
vote,
the
question
is
whether
corporations
and
labor
unions
have
to
do
it
the
same
way
all
the
rest
of
us
do.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
with
voluntary
funds
contributed
by
individuals
for
that
very
purpose.
and
the
pac
issue
that
has
been
discussed...
you
probably
have
heard
more
than
you
want
to
hear
about
this
law
in
any
event,
and
certainly
about
the
pacs.
but
the
pac
issue
that
i
want
to
address
and
the
media
exemption.
on
pacs,
we've
heard
about
that
the
labor
unions
and
how
hard
it
is
for
the
afl-cio
and
what
evidence
there
is
in
the
record.
okay,
in
the
2000
election
cycle,
labor
unions
contributed
$53
million
from
their
pacs
in
contributions
and
expenditures.
and
that's
not
including
the
treasury
funds
that
they
use
to
run
the
kind
of
electioneering
ads
that
are
included
in
our
submission.
i
guess
the
other
two
organizations
that
were
named
were
the
national
rifle
association
and
the
aclu.
the
national
rifle
association
had
so
much
extra
money
left
in
its
pac
in
the
last
election
cycle
that
it
ended
up
spending
millions
of
dollars
on
things
that
it
wasn't
even
required
to
use
pac
money
for.
it
has
4
million
members.
if
each
of
those
4
million
members
gives
$10
a
year,
they
will
have
one
of
the
biggest...
probably
the
biggest
pac
in
history,
$40
million.
and
there
is
no
showing
whatsoever...
they've
just
raised
their
dues
from
$25
to
$35.
if
they
just
say
the
dues
are
still
$25.
but
if
you
believe
with
us
that
political
advocacy
in
this
case
and
talking
to
candidates
and
voters
who
are
voting
the
candidates
about
how
precious
the
second
amendment
is,
please
give
us
$10.
if
and
when
a
day
comes
when
they
can't
fund
their
advocacy
in
this
narrow
window,
with
respect
to
broadcast
ads
targeted
at
particular
races,
the
courts
will
be
open
to
them.
this
court
has
announced
an
exception
to
the
pac
requirement
in
mcfl,
and
the
courts
are
available
to
any
corporation
that
wants
to...
or
labor
union
that
wants
to
come
in
and
say
we
don't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--indeed,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
in
mcfl
itself,
for
example,
we
have
an
as-applied
exemption
made
by
the
court
in
order
to
satisfy
constitutional
concerns.
and
our
only
submission
is
that
on
its
face,
this
is
in
an
area
in
which
the
need
for
legislation
is
compelling,
but
the
drafting
challenges
are
daunting.
this
effort
by
congress
at
least
deserves
a
chance
to
protect
itself.
now,
just
to
clarify--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
it
should
have
the
opportunity
to
prove
that
the
parade
of
horribles
that
our
opponents,
the
type
of
hypotheticals,
we
won't
be
able
to
fund
a
pac,
or
we
want
to
run--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--how
well
i
know.
but
in
all
seriousness,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
be
one
of
the
happiest
people
on
the
face
of
the
planet
when
i
sit
down
today,
however
you
decide.
but
we're
talking
about
a
facial
challenge,
a
facial
challenge.
and
the
express
advocacy
test,
the
contribution
limits
and
expenditure
limits
were
not
declared
unconstitutional
on
their
face
when
this
court
found
in
mcfl
that
were
some
pac
burdens
for
some
types
of
corporations
that
the
first
amendment
should
not
require
to
be
borne.
now,
with
respect
to
the
media
exception,
i
think
there
may
be
a
misunderstanding
about
what
this
exception
actually
says.
it's
not
an
exception
for
general
electric
or
people
who
own
medias.
it's
on
page
29a
of
the
government's
jurisdictional
statement.
it
accepts
a
communication
appearing
in
a
news
story,
commentary
or
editorial
distributed
through
the
facilities
of
any
broadcasting
