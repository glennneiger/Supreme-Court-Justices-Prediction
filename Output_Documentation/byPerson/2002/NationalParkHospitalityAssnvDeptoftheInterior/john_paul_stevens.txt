but,
mr.
elwood,
isn't
it
really...
isn't
a
waiver
of
prejudgment
interest
comparable
to
a
waiver
of
punitive
damages,
for
example,
which
if
you
insist
on
it,
would
affect
the...
the
amount
one
would
bid
for
a
contract?
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
it's
worth
nothing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
it's
something...
if
the
government
is
willing
to
fight
about
it
here
and
insist...
and
put
it
in
every
contract,
it
must
be
of
value
to
the
government.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
unfair
to
pick
it
apart
in
this
way.
just
a
little
part
of
a
major
opinion.
