mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
applicability
of
the
contract
disputes
act
to
contracts
between
national
park
service
and
the
private
concessioners
who
contract
to
provide
visitor
services
and
to
operate
and
maintain
facilities
in
more
than
100
of
our
national
parks.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
your
honor,
to
begin
with,
let
me
say
that
as
to
this
facial
challenge
point,
this...
this
was
an
argument
that
was
never
made
below.
it
was
not
made
in
the
district
court.
it
was
not
made
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
not
made
in
the
opposition
to
certiorari.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
jurisdictional
issue.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
so
it...
it
may
well
be
waived.
but
let
me
also
say
quickly
that
i
think
this
whole--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
i
was
going
to
address
ripeness.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
i
was
going
to
address
ripeness
separately,
justice
scalia.
in
terms
of
this
facial/as-applied,
this
is
an
apa
challenge
to
a
regulation.
i'm
not
aware
that
the
court
has
really
used
this
facial/as-applied
nomenclature--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--in
that...
in
that
context.
after
all,
under
the
apa,
the
question
is
whether
a...
an...
a
regulation
is
arbitrary
or
capricious
or
contrary
to
law.
here
we
have
a
regulation
that
categorically
states
no
nps...
no
national
park
service
concession
contracts
are
subject
to
the
cda.
if
there...
there
are,
in
fact,
some
such
contracts
that
are
subject
to
the
cda,
as
we
believe
there
are,
then
that
regulation
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
the
agency
should
have
to
go
back
and
draft
a
more
refined
regulation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
no,
no.
i--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--not
quite,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i'm
trying
to...
i'm
trying
to
distinguish
the
facial/as-applied
point
that
justice
o'connor
raised
from
the
ripeness
question,
which
i'll
get
to
in
just
a
minute.
this
is
not
a...
a...
there
was
an
as-applied
challenge,
to
begin
with,
made
in
the
district
court.
this
is
not
a
facial
challenge
in
the
sense
that
we're
asking
the
court
to
strike
down
the
regulation
based
on
hypotheticals
or
on
factual
situations
that
may
never
arise.
we
know
what
these
concessions
contracts
look
like.
the
nps
has
issued
standard
concessions
contracts.
it
seems
to
us
rather
easy
to
determine
whether
the
services
that
are
called
for
in
those
contracts
bring
the
contracts
within
the...
within
the
cda.
so
i
don't
think
there's
anything
to
this
facial
challenge.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor,
because
there
are
standard
concessions
contracts.
they're
in
the
record
and
it's
clear
that
they
call
for
certain
types
of
services.
and
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
court,
as
the
two
lower
courts
did,
can
determine
whether
those
contracts
call
for
the
procurement
of
services
that
would
bring
them
within
the
cda
or
call
for
the
repair
or
maintenance
of
real
property.
now--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--three.
there
are,
i
think,
three.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
they
all
call
for
the
same
types
of
services
at
national
parks.
there
are...
there
are
copies
in
the...
in
the
record.
now,
in
terms
of
your
ripeness
argument,
justice
scalia,
once
again,
the...
the
government
never
made
any
suggestion
that
this
case
was
not
ripe
below.
the
reason
it's
not
unripe
is
that
the
standard
concession
contracts
and
the
contracts
that,
in
fact,
the
nps
is
putting
out
for
bid
incorporate
within
them
the
statement
that
these
contracts
are
not
subject
to
the
cda.
the
npha
and
its
members
need
to
know
now,
in
terms
of
deciding
whether
to
bid
on
certain
contracts,
what
their
rights
are
under
those
contracts,
and
therefore--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
are
harmed,
justice
ginsburg,
because
it
is
important
for
the
concessioners
to
know,
at
the
time
that
they're
deciding
whether
to
bid
on
a
contract
and...
and
the
time
they're
deciding
how
much
to
bid
on
a
contract,
what
their
rights
are
under
that
contract.
it's
a
pre-bid...
it's
a
solicitation
in
which
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
but
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--and
we
would
be--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
would
be...
because
it
is
a
provision
of
these
contracts,
your
honor,
that
incorporates
the
regulation
that
states
that
they
are
not
subject
to
the
cda.
so
this
is
a
proper
challenge
to
the
solicitation
as
including
an
illegal
term.
the
contracts,
on
their
face
by
incorporating
this
regulation,
say
you
have
no
rights
under
the
cda.
it
seems
to
us...
and
we
think
the
law
is
clear,
although
the
government
never
made
this
challenge,
so
it's
not
been
briefed...
that
the
concessioners
have
a
right
to
know
at
the
outset,
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
bid,
whether
the
government
is
right
in
asserting
that
they
have
no
rights
under
the
cda
if
they
enter
into
these--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
don't
know,
justice
kennedy.
you
would
be
signing
a
contract
that
agrees
to
the
provision
in
the
contract
that
says
that
you
have
no
rights
enforceable
under
the
cda.
but
beyond
that,
the
government
has
taken
the
position
you
have
no
rights
enforceable
under
the
cda.
so
it's
not
clear
how
you
would
follow
through
on
your
rights
under
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but
this
is
a
pre-enforcement
challenge
to
a
regulation--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but
there
is
a--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but...
but,
justice
kennedy,
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
harm,
your
honor,
is
in
not
knowing,
at
the
time
you're
being
asked
to
bid
on
contracts,
what
your
rights
are
under
those
contracts.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it's
like
any
other
provision.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
there
is
a--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
that
there's--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
i
think
there
is
authority
under...
under
the...
under
the
tucker
act,
which
is
one
of
the
provisions
of...
that
we
cited
in
the
complaint,
that
allows
you
to
bring
challenges
to
bid
solicitations
on
the
ground
that
they--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--and
these...
these
are...
absolutely
regulations
are
incorporated
into
the
contract.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it's
section
1491.
i
mean,
it...
it
is
one
of
the
provisions
that
we
relied
on
in
the...
in
the
complaint
in
this
case
to
bring
this
challenge.
and
i
might
say
to
the
court--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
there
are,
but...
but
i
was
about
to
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
this...
that
the
government
has
never
challenged
ripeness,
and
that's
not
suggest...
it
is
not
to
suggest
that
it's
not
something
that
this
court
can
consider,
but
i
think
it's
unfair
to
decide
that
issue
on
the...
when
it
hasn't
been
fully
briefed
by
the
parties.
it's
never
been
challenged
at
any
time
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but
they're
not
amorphous,
justice
scalia--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--because--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i'm
not
suggesting
the
court
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
do
it.
i'm
suggesting
the
issue
has
not
been
briefed,
that
we
did
present
the
tucker
act
as
the
basis
for
jurisdiction
in
the
court--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--excuse
me?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
precisely...
that's
precisely
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
they
are.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--because
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
important--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
a
very
important
question,
justice
o'connor.
what
is
at
stake
are
the
rights...
the...
the
rights,
the
substantive
and
the
procedural
rights,
that
are
available
to...
to
a
government
contractor
if
it...
it
gets
into
a
dispute
with
the...
with
the
contracting
agency.
now,
under
the
cda,
there
are
very
important
procedural
and
substantive
rights
that
are
available
that
would
not
be
available
under
other
law,
and
that's...
that
was--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--for
example--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--what's
at
stake
principally
is,
first
of
all,
an
administrative
mechanism,
which
is
these
boards
of
contract
appeals,
that
would...
are
available
to
decide
these
matters
expeditiously
and
particularly
with
small
claims
without
having
to
go
to
court.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
as
opposed
to
having
to
go
to
court,
as
opposed
to
having
to
go
to
the
court
of
federal
claims
where
it's
not
even
clear
what
the
standard
of
review
would
be.
the
standard
of
review
under
the
cda
is
de
novo.
so
that's
a
very
important
substantive
and
procedural
right,
in
addition
to--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--both.
after
the
contracting
officer
decides
an
issue
adversely
to
the
contractor
under
the
cda,
the
contractor
has
the
choice
either
to
go
to
the
board
of
contract
appeals
or
to
file
a
lawsuit
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
in
either
event,
the
review
is
de
novo.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
it
wouldn't
be
de
novo.
that
would
be
appellate.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
and
it's
not
right,
justice
breyer.
actually
what
we
want
to
be
able
to
do
is
to
avoid
having
to
follow
whatever
procedures
the
agency
sets
up
in
its
contract
for...
for
seeking
review
if
there's
a
dispute.
we
want
to
go--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
but
the
interior
department
and
the
nps
has
not
acceded
to
those
decisions,
and
it
has
issued
a
regulation
that
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
those
were
all
prior
to
the
government's
issuance
of
the
regulation
in
this
case,
a
regulation
that's
now
been
upheld
by
the
d.c.
circuit.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
nps.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
yes.
well,
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
don't,
in
fact,
administer
the
cda,
your
honor,
so
we
don't
think
this
is
a
regulation
that's
entitled
to
any
deference.
nonetheless,
it's
their
position.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
think--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--our
view
is
that
this
is
a
regulation
that
represents
the
views
of
the
nps.
it's
not
entitled
to
any
deference
because
it's
not
a
statute
that
they
administer.
the
government
would
have
to
give
you
its
view
of
how
much
deference
it
is
entitled
to.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but
this
is
still
an
apa--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
find
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
find
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--footnote
very
confusing.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we're
challenging
both.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we're
challenging
both.
we
brought
an
apa
challenge
to
the
regulation,
as
well
as
a
tucker
act
challenge
and
a
pre-bid
solicitation
challenge
to
the
inclusion
of
these...
this...
this
illegal
term
in
the...
in
the
contracts.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
because
i
think
under
the
law
we're
entitled
to
challenge
that
solicitation
as
illegal.
if
we
have
to
bid
on
these
contracts,
we're
entitled
to
know--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--they
are
claiming
that
that
is
the
position
that
they're
going
to
take
and
that
it
is
entitled
to
some
level
of
deference.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
footnote
clearly
says
that
it
is
entitled
to
some
level
of
deference.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
this
is
clearly
the
position,
and
it's
been
upheld
by
the
d.c.
circuit.
there's
no
reason
to
suggest
they're
not
going
to
adamantly
enforce
their...
their
views.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but
it
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but,
justice
ginsburg,
as
i
said,
there's
still
this
provision
in
all
of
the
contracts.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
government
would
still
be
asking
us
to
accede
to
a
position
and
sign
a
contract
that
contains
a
term
which
we
believe
is
illegal
that
says
we
have
no
rights
under
the
cda.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
i
believe
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
very
large
body
of
government
contracting
law...
it's
not
in
the
briefs
because
it
wasn't
raised...
allowing--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--allowing
these
sorts
of
challenges
to
illegal
terms
in
contracts.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
obviously,
these...
these
cases
are
generally
litigated
in
the...
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
and
in
the
district
courts.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
well,
there
are
probably
some
appellate
decisions
as
well,
but
the
law
is
fairly
well-settled
in
this
area.
as
i
say,
the
government
has
never
challenged
the
ripeness
of
the
cda--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
abbott
laboratories
is...
is
obviously
an
apa
case.
i
think
we
could
meet
that
standard
because
we
need
to
know
now
whether
we
should
bid
on
these
contracts.
but
there's
a
separate
body
of
law
involving
solicitations
for
government
contracts
is
what
i'm
saying
to
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
brought
both
an
apa
cause
of
action
and
a
challenge
under
the...
under
the
tucker
act,
and
you
know,
we
would
maintain
that
we
can
challenge
this
regulation,
and
in
addition,
we
can
challenge
this
bid
solicitation.
the
two
really
overlap
because
the
regulation
is
incorporated
into
the
contract.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
was
no
such--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--there...
there
was
no
such--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
your...
there
was...
there
was
no
finding
by
the
district
court,
your
honor,
because
there
was
not...
there
was
no
challenge
to
the
ripeness
by
the
government,
but
the...
the
complaint,
as
i
recall,
did
make
that
allegation.
the
complaint
made
the
allegation
that
the
contractors
needed
to
know
whether
these
contracts
were
covered
by
the
cda.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
specifically
recall
that
allegation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
but
it's
a
question
of
how--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but
it's
not
binary,
justice
kennedy.
maybe
you
would
still
enter
into
the
contract
negotiations.
it's
one
factor
in
deciding
how
much
you'll
bid
on
the
contract.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
are--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
no.
well,
that's
not
precisely
true,
justice
scalia,
because
there
were
bid
solicitations.
in
the
district
court,
there
were...
there
were
lawsuits
brought
both
by
the
national
park
hospitality
association
on
behalf
of
its
members,
as
well
as...
as
lawsuits
brought
by
several
concessioners
challenging
specific
bid
solicitations
as
to
them.
and...
and
therefore,
there
was
both
facial
and
as-applied,
in
effect,
challenges
to
the...
to
the
cda
point
in
the...
in
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
merits.
thank
you,
justice
breyer.
can
i...
i'd
like
to
begin
by
saying
it's
purely
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
and
we
think
that
the
statute
on
its
face
unambiguously
answers
the
question
before
the
court.
and
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
the
court
could
look
at
section
3(a)
of
the
contract
disputes
act
which...
which
appears
in
many
places,
including
page
1
of
the
blue
brief,
because
you'll
see
that
section
3(a)
states
that
unless
specifically
excluded
therein,
the
cda
applies
to,
quote,
any
express
or
implied
contract
entered
into
by
an
executive
agency
for,
among
other
things,
the
procurement
of
services
or
the
procurement
of
construction,
repair,
or
maintenance
of
real
property.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
necessarily
the
question,
but
let
me
address
it
this
way,
your
honor.
the
national
park
service
does
not
contend
that
its
concessions
contracts
are
not
contracts
within
the
meaning
of
the
cda.
it
doesn't
contend
that
it's
not
an
executive
agency.
and
the
nps
doesn't
contend
that
any
provision
of
the
cda
or,
for
that
matter,
any
other
federal
statute
specifically
excludes
these
contracts
from
the...
from
the
cda.
and,
justice
breyer,
the
nps
really
doesn't
even
take
issue
with
the
fact
that
these
concessions
contracts
procure
services
and
procure
the
construction,
repair,
and
maintenance
of
real
property.
in
other
words,
every
single
statutory
requirement
on
the
face
of
the
statute
would
seem
to
be
satisfied--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--they
do
not
challenge,
your
honor,
that...
that
these
contracts
procure
services--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
the
government
claims--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
government--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that
now
because
the
government
claims
that
these
contracts
are
not
within
the
protection
of
the
cda.
and
why?
its
entire
argument
amounts
to
the
following.
the
government
says
that
the
word
procurement
and
the
phrase,
procurement
contract,
we
are
told,
have
a
universally
understood
and
well-settled
meaning.
and
they
tell
us
that
to
qualify
as
a
procurement
contract,
the
government
says,
an
acquisition
must
be
for
the
direct
use
and
benefit
of
the
government
and
it
must
be
paid
for
with
what
the
government
calls
government
funds.
now,
the
first
thing
to
be
said,
justice
breyer,
about
the
government's
argument
is
that
it
is
a
complete
invention.
it
is
a
complete
invention.
no
federal
statute
defines
the
word
procurement
or
the
word,
procurement
contract,
to
include
the
two
requirements
that
the
government
tells
us
are
essential.
in
fact,
the
office
of
federal
procurement
policy
act...
the
government
cites
lots
and
lots
of--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
you'd
say
arranged.
you
could
say
they
procured
having
someone
sell
balloons
at
the
fourth
of
july.
the...
the
office
of
federal
procurement
policy
act--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but
the...
but
there
is
no
statute
that...
the
office
of
federal
procurement
policy
act,
which
is
a
companion
statute
to
the
cda,
actually
has
a
definition
of
the
word
procurement.
you
wouldn't
know
it
from
reading
the
government's
brief
because
in
their...
it
doesn't
refer
to
that,
but
it
contains
a
definition
of
the
word
procurement
that
does
not
contain
either
of
the
two
requirements
that
the
government
tells
us
are
essential
to
a
government
procurement.
no
court
has
ever
construed
the
word
procurement
to
include
the
two
requirements
that
the
government
tells
us
are
clearly
established
and
well-settled
by
federal
procurement--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
that's...
that's
not
a
statute,
but
let
me
address
that,
justice
ginsburg.
first
of
all,
appropriated
funds.
it
is
clear...
and
the
government
has
not
challenged
the
fact...
that
the
cda
applies
to
contracts
even
when
appropriated
funds
are
not
used.
that's
clear
on
the
face
of
the
cda.
so
the
government
is
forced
to
come...
come
up
with
this
new
phrase,
government
funds,
which
has,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
no
basis
at
all
in
any
prior
statute
or
any
federal
procurement
law.
and
the
fact--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but,
your
honor,
there
are
many
other...
the
government
principally
relies
on
other
statutes
that
have
the...
have
certain
provisions
like
the
ones
they
would
like
to
introduce
into
the
cda
in
them.
but
i
think
it's
quite
significant
that
congress
didn't
put
these
provisions
in
the
cda.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
think
it...
it
does
not--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
doesn't
suggest
that
at
all,
justice
scalia.
first
of
all,
they
only
quote
that
incompletely.
it
also--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--in...
in
our--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--in
our
reply
brief,
it
says,
by
such
appropriated...
by...
by
the
appropriations
of
that
agency
or
such
other
appropriations
as
the
agency
has
to
get.
now,
the
nps
is
a...
a--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but
the...
the
cda
on
its
face...
and
the
government
concedes
this...
applies
to
contracts
that
don't
involve
appropriated
funds
agencies.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
i
think
it's
clear
there's
no...
there's
no
doubt
that
the
cda
applies
to
any
contract
whether
or
not
it's
an
appropriated
funds
agency
or
not.
let
me
just
say
that
in
addition
to
being,
i
think,
totally
unsupported
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
limitations
that
the
nps
asks
this
court
to
read
into
the
cda
would
be
completely
unworkable
as
a
matter
of
practice.
i
think
we've
already
talked
about
the
government
funds
point
which
is,
i
think,
a
phrase
that
they
have
dreamt
up.
it
has
no
basis
in
law,
unlike
appropriated
funds,
which
is
not
the
case
of
the
cda.
but
i
think
it's
also
the
case
that
this
use
or
benefit
to
the
government
notion
is
completely
unworkable.
if,
for
example,
the
nps
were
to
go
out
and
procure
water
coolers
for
use
in
the
department
of
interior
building,
the
nps
would
concede
that
those
would
be
within
the
contract
disputes
act
because
they're...
they're
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
the
government.
if
the
government
were
to
go
out
and
procure
the
same
water
coolers
for
use
on
the
mall
during
the
fourth
of
july,
the
court...
the
nps
would
say,
well,
that's
not
for
the
use
or
benefit
of
the
government.
i
don't
know
how
you
could
decide
what
is
for
the
use
or
benefit
of
the
government.
when...
if
the
government...
if
the
nps
issues
a
contract
to
build
a...
the
world
war
ii
memorial
on
the
mall,
which
is
now
being...
is
now
happening,
is
that
for
the
use
of
the
public
or
it
is
used
for
the
government?
we
don't
think
this
is
a
defensible
position,
and
it
certainly
finds
no
basis
in
the
cda.
we
think
it's
an
irrational
reading
of
the
act
that
has
no
support
in
the
language
or
the
legislative
history
or
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
and
i
want
to
say
that
even
if
there
was
a
use
or
benefit
to
the
government
limitation
in
the
cda,
we
think
it
would...
these
contracts
would
still
clearly
satisfy
it
because
these
concessions
contracts
are
being
let
in
part
to
help
the
department
of
interior,
the
nps
fulfill
its
statutory
mission.
if
these
concessions
were
not
there
operating
these
restaurants
or
guest
facilities,
the
nps
would
have
to
operate
them
themselves
in
order
to
satisfy
its...
the
statutory
requirement
that
they
provide
for
the
use
and
enjoyment
of
the
national
parks.
so
we
don't
think
it's
possible
to
say
that
these
concession
contracts
the...
that
the
nps
is
completely
indifferent
to
these
concession
contracts.
they
are
clearly
for
the
use
and
benefit
not
only
of
the
public,
but
also
of
the
nps.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
complaint...
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
filed
under
the
authority
of
28
u.s.c.
1491(b).
the
court
will
find
that
at
page
13
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
that...
that
statute
provides
for
district
court
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
challenges
to
the
terms
of
proposed
government
contracts.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
paragraph
62
and
114
of
the
joint...
of
the
complaint,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
you'll
see
the
allegations
that
were
made
in
the
complaint
to
fall
within
that
provision
of...
of
title
28.
as
to
the
substance
of
the
cda
claim,
the
government
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
no,
quote,
government
funds
were
used
here.
and
i
cannot
stress
enough
that
that
is
a
phrase
that
they've
invented
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
it
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
the
concessioners
received
monies
here
from
the
visitors
to
the
national
park,
remit
some
of
it
to
the
nps
as
a
franchise
fee,
and
keep
the
rest
of
it.
but
these
contracts
could
just
have
easily
been
structured
so
that
the
nps
got
all
the
money
in
the
first
instance,
kept
some
of
it
as
a
franchise
fee,
and
paid
the
rest
of
it
back
to
the
concessioners.
and
in
fact,
some
government
concessions
contracts
are
written
that
way.
in
that
case,
even
the
government,
i
think,
would
have
to
concede
that
government
funds
were
used.
we
can't
believe
that
the
cda
coverage
of
the
cda,
these
important
procedural
and
substantive
protections,
turns
on
such
flimsy
determinations
as
to
who
gets
the
money
in
the
first
instance.
now,
secondly,
we...
we've
already
talked
about
the
fact
that
so
many
services
are
being
provided
here
that
are
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
the
government,
as
well
as
for
the
visitors
of
the
national
parks.
but
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
the
government
is
the
sole
beneficiary
of
the
contractual
provisions
in
virtually
every
concessions
contract
requiring
the
construction,
repair,
and
maintenance
of
facilities
in
the
national
parks.
you
know,
if
the
court
will
look,
for
example,
at
page
96
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
a...
a
provision
of
the
grand
canyon
contract
that's
in
the
record,
you'll
see
there
that
this
contract...
under
this
the
contract,
the
nps
is
there
procuring
maintenance,
repair,
housekeeping,
and
groundskeeping
for
all
concessions
facilities.
it
seems
to
us
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
that...
of
that
procurement
and
compare
it
to
section
3(a)(3)
of
the
cda,
which...
which
provides
that
cda
coverage
for
contracts
for
the
procurement
of
construction
or
repair
or
maintenance
of
real
property,
it's
impossible
to
conclude,
i
think,
that
this
procurement
contract
doesn't
fall
within
the
cda.
thank
you.
