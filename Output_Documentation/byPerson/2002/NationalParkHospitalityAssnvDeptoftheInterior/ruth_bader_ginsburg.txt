but
how...
how
does
it
hurt
you
to...
in
the
present
posture,
as
i
understand
it,
the
contracts...
whatever
it's
called...
the
icba
decides
these
cases
in
your
favor.
so
in
the...
in
the
setting
of
a
concrete
dispute,
the
contracting
officer
rules
against
one
of
the
concessionaires.
the
concessionaires
goes
to
that
board
if
they
want
to
and
the
board
will
rule,
at
least
on
the
jurisdictional
point,
that...
that
the
contracts
dispute
act
does
apply.
so
how
are
you
hurting
by--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
de
novo
for
who?
for
the
contract
board
or
for
the
court
if
you
go--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
if
he
chooses
the
contract
board,
then
the...
the
next
step,
the
court
step
will
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--directly
to
the
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
wouldn't
go
to
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
can't
you
do
that?
that's
what
you've
been
doing
all
along.
that's
why
you...
you
have
the
several
decisions
of
the
ibca.
every
time
you
go
to
the
ibca,
they
say,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
isn't...
isn't
the
appropriate
thing
to
go?
you
go
to
the
ibca.
if
the
government
wants
to
challenge
the
jurisdiction
that
they
will
exercise,
the
resolution
that
they
make,
then
it's
up
to
the
government.
but
you
can
go
to
the
ibca.
they
have
been
welcoming
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
then...
but
if
the
case
isn't
ripe
and
we
should
so
hold,
i
assume
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
would
be
to
vacate
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
to
that
extent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
you'll
be...
what
you
would
be...
have
is
the
government
has
told
you
in
advance
what
its
litigating
position
would
be
and
it
has
no
more
meaning
than
a...
a
statement
of
what
the
government's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--position
is
with
no...
no--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
geller,
you
say...
you
say
it's
settled,
and
please
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
if...
if
abbott
laboratories
has
been
overtaken.
but
my
notion
was
that
in
order
to
have
a
pre-enforcement
challenge,
you
had
to
have
a
pretty
strong
claim
that
you
are
hurting
now,
as
they
were,
if
they
didn't...
if
they
spent
all
that
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
geller--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
looking
at
page
19
of
the
government's
brief,
and
they...
they
define
procurement.
they're
taking
it
from
the...
the
federal
acquisition
regulations
to
say
acquiring
by
contract
with
appropriated
funds
supplies
or
services
by
and
for
the
use
of
the
federal
government.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is
it...
is
it
your
view,
since
you
said
your...
your
interpretation
now
of
the...
the
position
that
the
park
service
is
taking
that
it...
it
doesn't
constitute
law?
how
can
it
constitute
law?
first
of
all,
the
contract
dispute
act
is
not
within
the
park
service
bailiwick.
it
isn't...
as
you
concede,
it
isn't
the...
doesn't
administer
this
act.
so
does
that
regulation
constitute
any
kind
of
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you...
you
would
have
to.
if
it's
not
ripe,
we'd
have
to
vacate
it
to
that
extent.
but
this...
in
the
d.c.
circuit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
the
d.c.
circuit,
this
was
a
giant,
one
of
those
typical
wholesale
attacks
on
many,
many
regulations,
on
the
whole...
on
the
whole
rulemaking.
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
was
just
a
tiny,
tiny
piece
of
a
long,
long
opinion--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--treating...
so
maybe
just
nobody
noticed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
the
as-applied/facial.
was
the
as-applied
challenges...
did
those
center
on
this
issue
or
did
they
relate
to
the...
to
another
issue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
did
the
park
service
first
install
this...
when
did
it
first
take
this
position?
it
wasn't
just
under
the
regulations,
as
i
understand
it.
when
did
the
park
service
take
the
position
that
concession
contracts
were
not
procurement
contracts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
elwood,
is
the
petitioner
right
in
saying
that...
that
when
the
government
sell
goods...
sells
goods,
that
comes
under
the
cda?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
those
are
not
procurement
contracts,
are
they?
