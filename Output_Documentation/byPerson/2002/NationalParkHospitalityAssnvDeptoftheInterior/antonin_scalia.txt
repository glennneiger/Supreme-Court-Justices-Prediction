justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
geller,
i
think
that...
i
think
the
ripeness
issue--
justice
antonin
scalia
--subsists
whether
or
not
it's
a
facial
challenge.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that...
is
that
the
standard
for
ripeness--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
the
regulation
is
arbitrary
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
this
any
different...
you
contend
that
the
agency
has
no
authority
to
speak
authoritatively
on
this...
on
this
issue
anyway.
and
therefore,
this
regulation,
as
i
understand
your...
your
position,
is...
is
of
no
more
effect
than
the
agency's
announcement
of
what
its
litigating
position
will
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many...
what
are
there?
10
standard
concession
contracts?
justice
antonin
scalia
three?
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
would
be
the
same
case
if
the
agency
simply
announced,
our
litigating
position
in
these
contracts
is
going
to
be
that
they
are
not
covered
by
the
contract
disputes
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
be
in
exactly
the
same
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
would...
would
you
have
the
ability
to
sue?
justice
antonin
scalia
--unless
it
force...
unless
the
failure
to
consider
it
forces
us
to
decide
a
case
on...
on
facts
that
we
find,
you
know,
rather
amorphous.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
purpose
of
the
ripeness
doctrine--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
make
it
easier
for
us
to
decide
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
is
the
issue
before
us--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
the
issue
before
us
whether
the
three
contracts
that
are
in
the
record
are
procurement
contracts
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
ripe
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
members
of
your
association
who
are
considering
bidding
on
contracts
that
contain...
that
those
three
contracts,
which
are
universal...
and
they
don't
want
to
do
it
if...
or
may
or
may
not
want
to
if
that...
that
term
is
lawful.
but
they
might
do
it
if
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
find
it
a
little
hard...
if
it's
a...
if
it's
a
really
good
contract,
you
i
suppose
intend
to
comply
with
it
and
you
don't
think
there's
going
to
be
any
litigation
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
say
these--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
geller,
you...
when
you
say
these
contracts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
keep
referring
to
these
contracts.
they're...
actually
you're
talking
about
three
contract
forms.
you're...
you're
not
discussing
any
particular--
justice
antonin
scalia
--bid
solicitation.
you...
you
have
no
particular
bid
solicitation,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
does
have
a
basis
in
just
what
justice
ginsburg
was
quoting,
48
c.f.r.
2.101.
so
they
say
it's
not
without
foundation
in
the
law.
what...
what
that's
from
is,
i
take
it,
it's
a
memo
that...
or
a
policy
issued
jointly
by
the
secretary
of
defense,
the
administrator
of
general
services,
and
the
nps
administrator.
so
when
they
have
a
reg
like
that,
i'd...
i'd
think
that
it's
not
so
that
it
isn't
somewhere
in
federal
law.
it's
right
there.
now,
there
are
some
other
things
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
you
say
are
not
necessarily
part
of
procurement.
but
that
fact
that
there
are
other
things
that
overstate
it
doesn't
mean
this
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
about...
he
put
one
in...
in
the
cda,
41
u.s.c.,
section
612(c).
it's
discussed
at
the
bottom
of
page
18
and
the
top
of
page
19
of...
of
the
government's
brief.
and
what
it
says
is
that
the
monetary
awards
in
favor
of
a
contractor
will
be
paid
out
of
the
judgment
fund
and
in
turn
provides
for
the
reimbursement
to
the
judgment
fund,
quote,
by
the
agency
whose
appropriations
were
used
for
the
contract,
which
would
suggest
that
in
all
cases--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
there's
been
a
judgment--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
well,
tell
me
why.
i...
i
know
that
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--reply
brief...
i
don't
see
how
the...
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but...
but
it
clearly
envisions
appropriations,
whether
they
have
it
already
or
they
have
to
get
it
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we'll
ask
the
government
about
that.
that's
a...
that's
a
much
more
serious
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
this...
what
about
the...
the
reply?
i
came
in
thinking
ripeness
was
a
problem,
and
your
brother
on
the
other
side
gave
to
me
what
was
a
very
convincing
answer.
what's
wrong
with
that
answer?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it
doesn't
affect...
but
what
they're
saying
is
that
where
the
government
offers
general
contracts
to
the
industry
and
there
is
a
term
in
all
of
those
contracts
which,
in
the
view
of
the
industry,
is
unlawful,
they...
it's
ripe
for
them
to
challenge
that.
now,
what
i'm
afraid
here
would
be
that
we
or
you
or
somebody,
in
deciding
whether
that's
an
incorrect
argument,
would
upset
what
could
be...
i
have
no
idea
if
it
is...
a
practice
of
contractors
objecting
to
terms
in
offered
contracts
as
contrary
to
law.
so
are
you
saying
now
that
that
is
not
ripe?
are
you
saying
that
a
contractor
who
comes
into
a
court
and
objects
to
a
term
in
a
proposed
contract
as
contrary
to
law
does
not
have
a
claim
because
it
is
not
ripe?
is
that
the
government's
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
would
think
probably
you
would
at
least
want
to
brief
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
said
it's
the
first
that's
at
issue
here.
now,
is
it
not
because...
you
heard
what
he
said.
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you...
so
there's
a
dispute
between
the
two
sides
on
what
the
case
law
says
as
to
whether...
and
it
isn't
even
a
general...
a
general
attack
upon
the
form
of...
upon
a
form
contract.
but
as
we
understand
from
petitioners,
there
were
particular
bids
outstanding
that
were
challenged
because...
because
of
a
term
in
them
that...
that
was
claimed
to
be
unlawful.
and
it
is
your
position
that
you
cannot
challenge
a
particular
bid
because
of
an
unlawful
term
unless
that
unlawful
term
affects
your
primary
conduct.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it...
it
does
on
your
analysis.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
you
said
one
of
the
things
that
is
important
is
prejudgment
interest.
so
i...
i
suppose
their
liability
under
the
contract
is
going
to
be
affected
by...
by
the
correctness
of
the
reg.
justice
antonin
scalia
their
primary
conduct
won't
be,
but
their
potential
liability,
if
there
is
a
contract
dispute,
would
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
vague?
i
mean,
they...
they
have
to
make
a
bid.
they
have
accountants.
these
are
big
companies.
they
calculate
everything
down
to
the
finest
penny,
and...
and
they
say,
you
know,
we
take
into
account
whether
we're
going
to
get
prejudgment
interest,
which
we...
if
we
have
a
dispute.
and
by
the
way,
we
have
one
dispute
every
3
hours,
and
so
it's
a
lot
of
money
to
us.
and
we
will
bid
$42.36
less
if
we're
not
getting
the...
whatever.
all
right?
so
they
work
it
all
out.
they
have
accountants
who
do
it.
and
so,
if
that's
so...
of
course,
if
it
isn't
so,
it's
a
different
story.
but
they've
said
something
like
that's
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying...
you...
you
claim
that
this
provision
is
not
incorporated
in
the
contracts.
is
that
the
position
the
government
is
taking?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
leaving
aside
the
question
of
inclusion,
what
is...
what
do
you
understand
your
difference
to
be
from
the
petitioners
with
respect
to
the
status
of
the
regulation
itself?
is
there
any
difference
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
we
got
any
jurisdiction
left?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
elwood,
if
i
can
assist
you
in
giving
the
merits
here,
is
it...
is
it
the
case,
as
the
petitioners
contend,
that
the
government
concedes
that
not
all
contracts
covered
by
the
cda
are
contracts
in
which
appropriated
funds
are
used?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
once
you
slip
off
from
appropriated
into...
into
government
funds,
you
don't
put
any...
you
don't
have
any
statutory
text
you
can
appeal
to
as...
as
separating
out
the
cda
from...
from
your
park
service
concessions.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
are
for
what
concessions?
ps...
px
concessions,
for
example?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
isn't
that...
i
mean...
because
i
was
about
to
ask
that
question
because
i
thought
you're
drawing
the
distinction
between
a
concession
to
provide
food
and
hot
dogs
and
amusement
to
visitors
to
the
park,
which
you
say
is
not
covered
by
the
cda,
and
it
seems
to
me,
a
contract
to
provide
food
and
hot
dogs
and...
i
don't
know...
maybe
amusement...
i
don't
know
what
they
have
at
px's...
to
members
of
the
armed
forces.
why
isn't
at
least
the
latter,
although
it's
a
concession
contract,
why
isn't
that
clearly
for
the
benefit
of
the
government
even...
even
in
the
narrow
sense
in
which
you
use
that
term?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
would
be
covered
by
the
cda.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
park
service
wrote
that
portion
of
the
committee
report.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
