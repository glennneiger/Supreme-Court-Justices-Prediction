they...
they
seem
to
agree
with
you
on
this
point.
i
mean,
they've...
they've
agreed
in
their
terms
that
it's
not
a
legislative
regulation
in
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--footnote
5
or
6--
justice
david
h.
souter
--whatever
it
is.
what
does
that
do
to...
to
our
jurisdiction?
i
mean,
is...
is...
are...
are
you
now
both--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
effect,
claiming
that
this
so-called
regulation
is
nothing
but
the
government's
statement
of
the
intention
to
take
a
position
when
and
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
time
comes?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
do
you
read
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--how
do
you
read
their
concession
in
the
footnote?
because
apparently--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i...
i
take
it
that
is
new,
by
the
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
am
i
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you...
you're
recalling
challenging
not
the...
not
the
ineffective
regulation,
but
rather
the
inclusion
of
what
the
regulation
says--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
the
contracts.
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
isn't
it
the
case
that
unless
you
have
an...
an
apa
issue,
there's
nothing
else
that
you
can
litigate
at
this
point?
i
mean,
if
the
only
thing
that
you
have
to
complain
about
is
that
they
want
to
put
a
term
in
a
contract
that
you
think
they
shouldn't
be
putting
in,
it's
up
to
you
to
decide
whether
you
want
to
contract
it
on
those
terms
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
at
this
stage
of
the
game,
they're
not
claiming
that
their
regulation
is...
is
what
they
call
a
legislative
regulation.
