justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
main
thing,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that
you're
trying
to
get
out
of
the
agency
appeals.
you
don't
want
to
have
to
go
through
the
agency.
this
gets
you
right
into
court
after
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--contracting
officer.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
does
that
get
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
does
that
give
you
an
apa
cause
of
action?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
say
then
is
the
government...
as
far
as
i
understand
it,
the
basic
point
is
that
this
is
not
a
procurement
contract
regardless
of
who's
entitled
to
what
deference.
and
the
reason
that
it
isn't
is
because
we
are
not
buying
anything,
and
that
isn't
a
technical
point.
that
is
an
important
point
because
you
and
us...
you,
the
private,
and
we,
the
government...
are
both
in
the
business
of
selling
things
to
the
government.
we
need
somewhat
more
control
over
the
interpretation
of
these
contracts.
and
that's
why
the
number
of
procedures
you
have
to
go
through
in
the
parks
department
is
greater,
and
all
the
things
that
you
don't
like
about
it
are
things
we
do
like
about
it.
namely,
we
get
a
little
bit
added
control.
but
that's
why
legitimately
these
are
not
procurement
contracts.
now,
your
point
in
response
to
roughly
that,
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
just
trying
to
get
you
to
the
merits,
so
i
thought
i'd--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
reason
that
doesn't
help
you
is
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
question
is
what's
procurement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
thought
they
did
challenge
that
these
are...
that
it's
procurement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
tried
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
the
word
procurement
has
a
natural
meaning.
if
they...
if
they
have
a
concessionaire
to
come
and
sell
balloons
on
the
fourth
of
july,
they
don't
say
they've
procured
some
balloons.
they
say
they've
arranged
for
some
balloons.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
that...
that...
that's
not
the
usual
meaning
of...
of
procure,
i
should
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
what's
the
difference
between
a
policy
statement
and
an
announced
position?
the...
the
point
at
which
each
one
is
going
to
have
practical
effect
is
the
point
at
which
there
is
a
claimed
breach
and
an
argument,
if
there
is
one,
over
what
the
remedial
process
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
is
the
position
of
the
government?
now,
i
know
this
is
hitting
you
cold,
but
i
think
it
would
be
helpful.
position
one.
we
have
not
thought
of
ripeness
before,
and
the
case
has
been
argued
and
submitted
on
the
assumption
that,
for
example,
the
bidding
would
be
affected
by
this
term
which
is
incorporated
into
the
contract.
that's
been
the
assumption,
and
we
see
no
reason
to
depart
from
it.
it's
not
jurisdictional.
so
decide
the
issue
we
briefed.
that's
position
one.
position
two.
we
haven't
thought
of
ripeness
before,
but
now
that
we
think
about
it,
we
think
it's
quite
a
serious
problem
and
we're
not
certain
what
the...
what
the...
what
the
issue
is
in
ordinary
contracts,
and
we're
not
certain
whether
it's
incorporated.
so
we
think
you
should
say
that
this
case
is
not
ripe.
now,
do
you
take
position
one,
which
will
mean
we
perhaps
could
go
to
decide
the
issue
for
which
it
was
granted,
or
do
you
take
position
two,
which
means
you
see
ripeness
as
a
big
problem
here
that
we
ought
to
look
at
further?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
asking
you
what
the
law
is
exactly.
i'm
asking
you
what's
the
government's
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
wouldn't
necessarily--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
wouldn't
necessarily
win.
i
mean,
i...
i
don't
know
if
you
would
win.
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
did
you
say
it
was
not
in
the
legislative
history
in
that
respect?
what...
what
is
this?
you...
you
quote
in
your
brief...
i
just
want
a
little
clarification.
there's
a
committee
report.
the
senate
report
says
that,
quote,
concessions
contracts
do
not
constitute
contracts
for
the
procurement
of
goods
and
services
for
the
benefit
of
the
government
or
otherwise.
and...
and
there's
something
odd
about
that
statement,
but
i
got
it
out
of...
you
quoted
it.
and
that
seems
to
be
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
and
apparently
it
isn't.
where...
what's...
what's
the
status
of
that
particular
remark?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
isn't
that
legislative
history?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
concessions
contracts
are
not
contracts
for
procurement
of
goods
and
services.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is...
aren't
we...
oh,
the
1998
act
is
which?
that's
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
what
we
have
is
in
that
act--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
i
see.
i
see.
