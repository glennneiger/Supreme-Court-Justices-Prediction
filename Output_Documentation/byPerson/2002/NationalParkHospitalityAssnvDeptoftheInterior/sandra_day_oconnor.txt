mr.
geller,
i
have
a
couple
of
preliminary
questions.
first
of
all,
this
is
a
facial
challenge
made
by
the
national
park
hospitality
association,
i
take
it.
how
is
the
claim
ripe
for
adjudication?
has
the
association
been
injured
actually?
there's
no
case
pending.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
one
that
we're
precluded
from
concerning
ourselves
with?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
presumably
there
are
many
different
kinds
of
concession
contracts.
some
might
be
covered;
some
might
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
geller,
one
other
thing
that
i'm
curious
about.
why
does
it
matter?
why
do
you
care--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--whether
it's
covered
by
the
cda?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
at
stake
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
real
world?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
like
what?
i
mean,
what--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what's
at
stake?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
opposed
to
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
will
you
tell
us
why
the
government
doesn't
want
the
cda
applicable
here?
i
mean,
what's...
what's
at
stake
for
the
government
in
not
applying
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
just
doesn't
tell
me,
as
a
practical
matter,
why
the
government
doesn't
want
it
applicable
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
want
to
pay
prejudgment
interest.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
so
at
bottom,
that's
it,
the
prejudgment
interest
feature.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this...
is
this
claim
ripe?
and
why
didn't
you
ever
talk
about
it
below?
what's
going
on?
it's...
it
comes
in
such
an
odd
posture.
what
is
the
government's
view
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
federal
use,
of
course...
it
is
of
use
to
the
park
service
to
have
facilities
available
to
the
public.
so
that
doesn't
really
answer
the
question.
the
parks...
the
park
service
wants
parks
available
to
the
public
with
services
in
them,
restrooms
and
buildings
and
restaurants
and
so
forth.
doesn't
it?
so
in
a
sense,
it
is
for
the
use
of
the
park
service
and
the
government
as
well
as
for
the
public.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
doesn't
really
say
that.
and
the
language
in
the
cda
is
broad,
and
presumably
this
was
a...
an
act
that
was
presumed
to
have
broad
application.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was...
was
there
ever
any
amendment
offered
in
congress
to
make
clear
that
it
didn't
apply
to
concession
contracts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
long...
at...
at
any
point
did
the
cda...
was
it
applied
or
followed
with
any
concession
contracts,
or
is
this
something
that
has
arisen
recently?
was
it
used
at
one
point?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
was
an
act
that
said
they're--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--they're
not
continuously
renewed
with
the
same--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--provider.
it
was
the
act
that
said,
but
we're
going
to
terminate
these
things.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
elwood,
is
there
anyplace
we
could
look
to
see
how
much
prejudgment
interest
the
park
service
has
had
to
pay
each
year?
is
it
a
big-ticket
item?
