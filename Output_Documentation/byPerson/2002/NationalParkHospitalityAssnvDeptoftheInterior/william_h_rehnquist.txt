we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
02-196,
the
national
park
hospitality
association
versus
the
department
of
the
interior.
mr.
geller.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
authority,
mr.
geller?
you
said
there
is--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
there...
is
there
any
case
that
supports
this
particular--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you...
you
say
the
government's
issuance
of
a--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it's
the
national
park
service.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
some
dispute
as
to
whether
they
even
have
the
authority
to
issue
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
government
would
still
be
asking
you
to
enter
a
contract--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
what...
what
if
the
government
contract
had
a
term
that
simply
said,
you
know,
there
would
be
damages
for
delay,
double
damages
depending
on
the
amount
of
delay?
and
you
say,
well,
i...
we
don't
think
the
government
is
authorized
to
put
that
in
a
contract.
could
you
challenge
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
where
is
the
law?
i
mean,
is
it
in
the
cases
of
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is...
is
that
where
the
law
is,
in
the
court
of
federal
claims?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that...
that's
your
stronger
card
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the...
in
the
sense
of
procurement
as
used
in
government
contracting?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
geller.
mr.
elwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
contract
itself
does
not
specify
that
the
cda
does
not
apply.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
that
the--
--you'd
say...
it
still
isn't
covered,
you
say,
unless
the
government
pays
out
cash.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
elwood.
mr.
geller,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
geller.
the
court
wishes
supplemental
briefs
on
the
issue
of
ripeness,

briefs,
due
3:00
p.m.
friday.
the
case
is
submitted.
