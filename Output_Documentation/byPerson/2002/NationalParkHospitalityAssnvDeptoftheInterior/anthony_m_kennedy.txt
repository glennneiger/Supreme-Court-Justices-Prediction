justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it's
an
invalid
provision,
could
the
contracting
party
simply
contract
and
then
go
into
court
later
on
and
say,
well,
this
clause
is
unenforceable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
--if
you're...
if
you're
right,
mr.
geller,
i
suppose
your
client
could
go
into
court
and
ask
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
even
though
there's
nothing
in
the
contract
saying,
we
want
to
find
out
which
provision
of...
as
to
review
applies
to
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's...
that's
the
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
case
that
i
put,
i
don't
think
you
could
get
declaratory
relief
until
you've
alleged
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
dispute.
you
can
say,
yes,
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
might
have
an
argument
down
the
line
and
i
want
to
know
where
i
want
to
go.
that
seems
to
me--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--speculative.
i
just
don't
see
the
harm
to
your
client
in
waiting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
it
established...
i
mean,
my...
my
guess
is
it
is,
but...
but
if
the
government,
the
defense
department,
any
other
department,
presents
a...
a
private
individual
with
a
contract
with
14
conditions
and
one
of
those
conditions,
in
the
view
of
the
private
person,
is
unlawful,
not
authorized
by
statute,
contrary
to
statute,
that
that
person,
before
bidding
on
the
contract,
can
go
to
court
and
say,
i
would
like
this
set
aside
as
unlawful.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
authority
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
there
is
authority
on
that,
i
guess
that's
the
end
of
it.
you're
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
these
regulations
are
incorporated
into
the
contract.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
may
i
ask
one
other...
other
question?
the...
court
of
appeals
addressed
this
part
of...
of
the
case
under
its
roman
iii...
roman
iii,
i
think,
the
contract
disputes
act.
did
the
contract
disputes
act
issue...
question
have
anything
to
do
with
the
other
argument
about
whether
or
not
these
concessions
are
renewed?
in
other
words,
if
a...
if
it's
not
a...
these
are
just
freestanding--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--issues
unrelated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
any
finding
in
the
district
court
that
the
inclusion
of
this
provision
was
critical
as
whether
or
not
you'd
go
ahead
with
the
contract?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
could
it
make
the
further
allegation
that
if
it...
if
it
were
not...
that
if
it
were...
were
not
covered,
it
would
not
engage
in
the
negotiations
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
commercial
matter.
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
it
if
there's
an
advantageous
contract,
but
you're
not
going
to
execute
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
you
go
through
one
form
of
remedy
or
the
other
in
the
event
of
a
breach.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
indicated
that
there's
a
stronger
argument
in
some
instances
than
in
others
for
the
fact
that
it's
a
concession.
a
concession
contract
can
be
a
procurement
contract.
does
that
go
back
to
our
basic
question
about
ripeness
and
we
don't
know
what
we're
involved
with
here?
or
can
we
take
these
contracts
where,
i
take
it,
they
did
involve
the
construction
of
facilities
at
national
parks,
et
cetera,
which
does
benefit
the
government
in
the
long
term?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if...
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
then
that
would
indicate
the
regulation
is
deficient
because
the
regulation
doesn't
purport
to...
to
use
this...
this
kind
of
fine
distinction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
regulation...
the
regulation
would
then
be
invalid
to
that
extent.
