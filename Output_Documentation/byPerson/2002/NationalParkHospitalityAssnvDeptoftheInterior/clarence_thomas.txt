justice
clarence
thomas
the
second
opinion
i
have
to
announce
for
the
court
is
national
park
hospitality
association
versus
department
of
interior,
no.
02-196.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
to
make
visits
to
national
parks
more
enjoyable
for
the
public,
congress
has
authorized
a
national
park
service
to
enter
into
concession
contract
for
various
goods
and
services.
in
regulations
issued
in
april
2000,
the
park
service
took
the
position
that
concession
contracts
are
not
subject
to
the
contract
disputes
act
of
1978,
the
cda.
that
act
provides
certain
protections
for
entities
contracting
with
the
united
states
government.
petitioner,
an
association
of
concessioners
doing
business
in
the
national
parks
challenged
the
regulation’s
validity.
the
district
court
held
in
favor
of
the
park
service
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
vacate
that
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
with
instructions
to
dismiss
because
the
controversy
is
not
yet
ripe.
determining
whether
administrative
action
is
ripe
for
judicial
review
requires
us
to
evaluate
two
considerations:
first,
the
fitness
of
the
issues
for
judicial
decision,
and
second,
the
hardship
for
the
parties
withholding
judicial
review.
taking
the
hardship
question
first,
the
regulation
here
is
nothing
more
than
a
general
policy
statement
informing
the
public
of
the
park
services
views
on
the
proper
application
of
the
cda.
as
such,
the
regulation
does
not
create
adverse
effects
of
a
strictly
legal
kind
and
does
not
affect
a
concessioner's
primary
conduct.
petitioner
argues
that
delaying
judicial
resolution
of
the
issue
will
cause
real
harm
because
the
cda’s
applicability
is
one
of
the
factors
taken
into
account
by
concessioners
preparing
its
bids.
we
are
not
persuaded.
mere
uncertainty
as
to
the
validity
of
a
legal
rule
does
not
constitute
a
hardship
for
purposes
of
the
ripeness
analysis.
in
short,
petitioner
has
failed
to
demonstrate
the
hardship
required
for
the
controversy
to
be
ripe
nor
is
the
issue
presented
fit
for
review,
even
though
the
question
is
purely
legal
and
the
regulation
constitutes
final
agency
action
under
the
apa,
both
parties
rely
on
specific
characteristics
of
certain
types
of
concession
contracts
to
support
their
position.
such
reliance
demonstrates
that
further
factual
development
would
significantly
advance
our
ability
to
deal
with
the
legal
issue
presented.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
o’connor
joined.
