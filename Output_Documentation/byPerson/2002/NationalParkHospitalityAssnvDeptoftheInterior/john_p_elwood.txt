mr.
john
p.
elwood
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--justice...
justice
o'connor,
the
reason
why
the
government
doesn't
want
this
applicable
here
is
that
the
contract
dispute
act
was
passed
to
address
specific
shortcomings
in
the
remedial
scheme
that
was
available
for
procurement
contracts,
and
because
it
was
designed
specifically
for
those
purposes,
it
have...
has
terms
that
we
don't
think
are
appropriate
in
this
context.
for
example--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--for
example,
the
prejudgment
interest
remedy.
congress--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--right,
and
we
don't
think
it's
appropriate.
congress
provided
prejudgment
interest
in
the
procurement
context
because
procurement
contractors
would
be
required
to
perform
under
the
contract
even
during
the
pendency
of
a
dispute
when
they
weren't
being
paid.
and
it
was
because
of
that
unique
position
where
they
were
both
being
required
to
make
outlays
without
getting
any
income
that
congress
thought
that
because
there
was
a--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i...
i
think
that
and
because...
there
are
other
things
as
well.
for
example,
the
purpose
of
the...
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
cda
was
to
cut
through
all
of
these
requirements
that
you
exhaust
administrative
remedies,
but
those
simply
aren't
present
in
the
concessions
context.
traditionally
concessioners
had
a
direct
right
of
access
to
courts,
and
congress
has
never
indicated
that
they
thought
the
remedial
scheme
was
inadequate
for
concessioners.
and--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--the
reason
why
we
did
not
raise
this...
why
we
did
not
raise
this
is
because
we
did
not
raise
it
below.
and
as
you
can
tell
from
the
pleadings--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--is...
because
the
cda
was
kind
of
a
side
show
below.
it
was
a
relatively
small
issue
and
it
was
just
not
the
focus
of
the
proceedings,
as
you
can
tell
by
the
opinion.
but
i
think
that
the
court
has
raised
valid
concerns
about
the
ripeness
in
this
sense.
the
court
has
traditionally
said
in
a
pre-enforcement
challenge
to
a
regulation
that
a
claim
is
ripe
if
it
affects
primary
conduct
so
that...
so
that
if
they
don't
comply,
they
might
be
held
liable.
that's
the
abbott
labs
line
of
cases.
and
here
this
doesn't
affect
primary
conduct.
it...
it
predominantly
just
says
whether
or
not...
which
forum
you're
going
to
have
a
remedy
in.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
and
that
is...
the
thing
is
because
it
predominantly
just
determines
which
forum
you
have...
which
forum
you
bring
your
claim
in,
i
don't
know--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--no,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
our
position.
if
it
affects
their
primary--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--right.
i
think
that
if
it
affects
their
primary
conduct,
if
affects
what
their
obligations
would
be
under
the
contract,
i
think
that
that
claim
would
be
ripe
for
pre-enforcement
review.
but
where
it
simply
determines
which
forum
they'll
bring
the
claim
in,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
covered.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that...
that's
correct.
but
i
think
simply
because
it
determines
which
forum
you
bring
your
claim
in,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
covered.
if
i
were--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--no.
if
it
affects
something
other,
i
think,
than
the
forum
in
which
it
was
brought,
i
mean,
if
it
affects
what
you
think
your
obligations
will
be,
if...
if
it
affects
the
price
that
you
think
you
should
pay
or
that
you
should
bid
on
a
contract,
i
think
that
that
would
be--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--subject
to
pre-enforcement
review.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
don't
think
their
liability--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--your
honor,
i
confess
that
i
am
not
sure
if
the
government
gets
prejudgment
interest
under
the
cda
or
not.
but
if
it
were...
if...
if
it
simply
ran
to
the
contractors,
i
think
that...
that
the
prospective
interest
on
a
claim
that
has
not
even
arisen
yet
seems
a
little
vague--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
it...
it
would
turn
on...
in
that
case
i
just
don't
think
that
in
advance
you
can
say
with
enough
sort
of
concreteness
and
specificity
that
you
know
how
much
a
particular
claim...
the...
the
as-yet
unfiled,
unrealized
contract
claims
would
be
worth.
you
could
say--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
mean--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--what
is
actually...
just
if
i
could
clarify
this.
what
is
put
into
the
contract
is
just
a
general
term
that
applicable
law
will
apply
and
because
applicable
law
includes
all
regulations,
it
is
incorporated
that
way.
it
doesn't
specifically
include
a
cda
waiver
or
anything
of
that
sort.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
no.
it
just
says
applicable
law
governs
the
contract.
but
i
think
it's
just
a
matter--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
that
that's
a
valid
concern
because
our
position
is
that
this
is
basically
just
an
interpretive
rule
announcing
the
position
that
the
park
service
will
take
and
the
park...
and
the
position
that
the
park
service
employees
will
take
in
administering
it.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think...
honestly,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
just...
it's
a...
it's
a
new
proposition
for
me,
and
i
think
that
a
good
argument
could
be
made
that
it
is
not
included
because
it...
it
really
just
represents
the
position
of
the
national
park
service.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
don't
know
that
there
is
a...
a
difference
with
respect
to
the
petitioner's
view.
it's
an
interpretive
rule
that
the
park
service
has--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
believe
so
because
it
is
the
announced
position.
it's
not
just
a
policy
statement.
it
is
basically
a
directive
to
the--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--yes,
but
i
think
that
the
only
difference
would
be
the...
the
principal
difference
would
be
policy
statements
are
more...
involve
more
variance
in
that
they
say
as
a
general
policy
we
will
do
this,
whereas
the...
as
an
interpretive
rule,
it
just
says
that
we
do
not
believe
that
concession
contracts
are
procurement
contracts.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
well,
justice
breyer,
it's
clearly
been
the
position
of
the
court
that
it
is
not
bound
by
the
failure
of
the
parties
to
raise
it.
that's
in
reno
versus
catholic
social
services,
and
of
course,
you
can
raise
it--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i...
i
think
our
position
would
be...
i
mean,
we...
we
filed
a
brief
in
opposition
and
i
think,
you
know,
if...
if
we
can
win
on
ripeness
grounds,
that's
great
too.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
right.
we
might
lose
the...
the
judgment
of
the
d.c.
circuit
as
well,
but--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
well,
i
think
that
it...
it
just
points
out
the
fact
that,
i
mean,
they...
they
had
an
awful
lot
on
their
plate,
and
it
perhaps
eluded
them
for
that
reason.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
they
related
to
other
claims,
justice
ginsburg.
xanterra
has
characterized
their
claim
as
an
as-applied
claim
although
they're...
they're
not
asking
for
as-applied
review
in
this
case.
but
if
you
look
at
their...
their
complaint,
their
complaint
involved
their
intention
to
bid
on
an
as-yet
unreleased
prospectus.
and
so,
in
that
sense,
i
don't
think
that
is
an
as-applied
change
for
two...
for
two
reasons.
not
only
is
there
no
contract
dispute,
but
at
the
time
that
the
complaint
was
filed,
there
was
no
contract.
so
we
think
that
it
would
be
a
facial
challenge.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that's
correct.
to
the
extent
that
it
covers
nonappropriated
fund
instrumentalities,
it
covers
contracts
that
would
involve
the
expenditure
of
nonappropriated
funds.
those
are,
however,
government
funds,
funds
of
government
entities
known
as
nonappropriated
fund
instrumentalities.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i...
i
don't
agree,
justice
scalia.
both
the...
well,
to
begin
with,
just
in
terms
of
giving
an
indication
of
what
the
commonly
accepted
meaning
of
the
term
was
at
the
time,
the
commission
on
government
procurement
reform,
which
was
the...
which
was
the
impetus
for
all
of
these
reforms,
defined
procurement
as
purchase
of
product
or
service
for
federal
use,
which
incorporates
both
a...
a
notion
of
expenditure
and
federal
use.
and
both
the...
the
1969
act--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--it
is
for
the
use...
well,
it
is
not
for
the
direct
use
of
the
national
park
service,
and
that
is
where
the
federal
grant
and
cooperative
agreement
comes
in.
8
months
before
passage
of
the
cda,
congress
explained
its
understanding
of
what
different
types
of
instruments
would
be
used
for,
and
it
explained
in
that
that
a
procurement
contract
would
be
an
instrument
whose
principal
purpose
is
the
acquisition
by
purchase,
lease,
or
barter
of
goods
or
services
for
the
direct
use
and
benefit
of
the
government.
and--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--it
was
presumed
to
have
broad
application
among
procurement
contracts.
there's
no
indication
that
they
did
not
intend
the
word
procurement
to
have
the
ordinary
meaning
that
it
does
in
that
sense,
as
indicated
in
the
commission
on
government
procurement
reform
and
the
way
it
was
used
there,
as
indicated
in
the
1969
act
creating
the
commission
and
the
ofpp
act
where
the
simple
use...
word
procurement
was
understood
to
mean--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--there
was
no...
no,
there
was
no
indication
in
the
entire
legislative
history
that
the...
that
concessions
came
up,
and
in
1,200
pages
of
reports
on
both
procurement
and
nonappropriated
fund
procurement,
there
was
not
a
single
mention
of...
of...
national
parks
concessions.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
there
are
a
number
of
armed
service
board
of
contract
appeals
that
assume
cda
jurisdiction,
and
the
board
of
contract
appeals
of
the
department
of
interior
started
using
it
in
1989.
but
i'm
not
familiar
with
usage
prior
to
that--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
no,
justice
scalia.
we
would...
we
would
agree
that
that
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
government.
it's...
it
doesn't
involve
the
expenditure
of
government
funds,
but
it's
for
the
benefit
of
the
government.
and
for
this
reason--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i...
i
don't
believe
it
necessarily
would
because
it
doesn't
involve
the
expenditure
of
government
funds.
it's
still
private
contractors
coming
in
and
being...
and
paying
the
government
for
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
but
as
far
as
the
benefit
goes,
i
think
agencies
have
a
direct
interest
in
providing
benefits
to
their
employees
and
especially
in
the
px
example
because
px's,
for
example,
are
basically
a
fringe
benefit
for
servicemen
and
women
and
their
dependents
in
that
it's...
it's...
basically
access
is
limited
to
them.
and
salary
and
fringe
benefits
of
that
sort
are
how
agencies
procure
employees.
that
is
how
they
attract
and
retain
qualified
personnel.
and
in
fact,
agencies
have
drawn
a
distinction
between
benefits
provided
to
employees
and
benefits
provided
to
the
entire
public--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
that
that
would
be
the
better
view,
but
i
think
obviously
a
stronger
argument
could
be
made
for
concessioners.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
no.
those
are
both
the...
those
are
committee
reports--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--for
the
1998
act.
so
it's
part
of
the
legislative
history.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
oh,
it
is...
it
is...
i
don't
know
that
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
oh.
i
was
addressing
the...
the
legislative
history
of
the
cda,
not
the
1998
act.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that
is
the
act...
the
current
concession
authority,
the
current
authority
under
which
the
national
park
service
issues
concession
contracts.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that's
correct.
it
eliminated
the--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
the
first
time
they
took
that
position
publicly
was
in
1979
in
a
board
of
contract
appeals
case,
yosemite
park
&
curry
company.
the
court...
the
ibca,
rather,
did
not
address
it,
though,
because
it
was
actually
before
the
effective
date
of
the
cda,
and
they
took
it
specifically
with
respect
to
the
cda
there.
but
traditionally...
although
it's
impossible
because
of
absence
of
institutional
memory,
traditionally
concession
contracts
have
not
been
viewed
as
procurement
contracts
by
the
national
park
service.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
thinks
that
the
specific
terms
of
concession
contracts
and
what
is
accomplished
under
them
affects
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
they're
procurements,
i
think
that
the
court
would
have
some
difficulty
in
saying
authoritatively
whether
they
all
are
or
an
unacceptably
high
portion
of
them
are
procurement
contracts
without
having
a
better
idea
of
what
is
included
with
them.
if
i
could--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--but
still
it...
it's
something
that
could
be
addressed
in
as-applied
challenges
where
you
could
say,
in
my
particular
case,
where
it
requires
me
to
build
a
lodge
or
whatever,
this
is
a
procurement
contract,
and
under
those
circumstances
it
would
be
very
clear
exactly
what
was
required
of
the
procurement
contractor.
and
they
could...
they
could...
of
the
concessions
contractor
and
they
could
determine
whether
or
not
that
particular
contract
was
a
procurement.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
yes,
but
the
court
has
held...
this
court
has
indicated
in
ins
versus
national
center
for
immigrants'
rights,
babbitt
versus
sweet
home,
and
cases
like
that
that...
that
merely
because
a
regulation
is
invalid
in
some
applications,
it
will
not
be
invalidated
on
a
facial
basis.
if
i
could
just
address
specifically--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--it's
not
a
big-ticket
item.
the
only
three
cases
in
which
the...
the
cda
has
been
applied
to
national
park
concessions
are
the
three
ibca
cases
mentioned,
and
in
two
of
those,
the
government
wound
up
winning
on
the
merits,
so
there
was
no
prejudgment
interest
paid.
so
it's
only
in
that
r&r
enterprises
case
that
the
government
would
have
paid
any
prejudgment
interest
in
this
case.
if
i
could
just
go
to
your
example,
justice
kennedy,
about
the
building
of
buildings
on
national
parklands.
i
believe
that
is
not
a
procurement
for...
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
first,
just
as
a
statistical
matter,
78
percent
of
concessions
contracts
do
not
involve
any
capital
improvements.
and
that
is
a
very
broad
term.
it's
much
broader
than
just
structures.
it's
structures,
unremovable
property,
and
fixtures.
but
on
the
merits,
many
concessions
contractors
have
been
required,
since
the
very
beginning
of
the...
of...
of
concessions,
1872,
to
require...
they've
been
required
to
build
their
own
buildings.
and
historically
that
has
not
been
considered
something
that
the
government
gets.
it
doesn't
get
the
benefit
of
those
services
because
it
enters
the
contracts
not
for
purposes
of
getting
a
building,
but
because
it
wishes
to
have
concessioners
provide
services
to
park
visitors.
and
in
order
to
do
that,
it
tolerates
the
building.
the
national
park
service
doesn't
want
buildings
in
the
parks.
it
wants
nature
in
the
parks,
and
it
tolerates
the
buildings
to
the
extent
that
they
are
used
to
provide
visitor
services.
and
i
think
this
comes
across
in
the
way
these
are
treated
by
the
contract.
even
though
the
government
has
bare
title
in
these
buildings,
in
a
very
real
sense
it
doesn't
buy
them.
every
concessioner
who
builds
a
building
in
the
national
parks
under
a
concessions
agreement
will
have
a
leasehold
surrender
interest
equal
to
the
construction
cost
of
the
building
plus
inflation
minus
depreciation.
and
they
cannot
be
put
out
of
that
building
by
anyone
until
they
are
paid
that
leasehold
surrender
interest;
that
is,
until
the
building
essentially
is
bought.
as
long
as
a
concessioner
is
operating
out
of
that
building,
a
concessioner
will
hold
the
leasehold
surrender
interest,
not
the
government.
also,
i
think
it's
telling
that
the
form
contract
indicates
that
if
the
concessioner
ever
leaves
the...
ever
abandons
the
building,
ever...
that
they
have
constructed,
that
the
government
can
require
them
to
knock
it
down
and
restore
the
site
to
its
natural...
its
natural
state.
that's
section
9b
of
the
standard
contract
and
in
the
contract
that
it's
in
the
joint
appendix.
so
again,
that's
an
indication
that
they're
not
interested
really
in
procuring
the
construction
services.
they're
interested
in
authorizing
a
concessioner
to
provide
services
to
visitors
to
the
national
parks.
finally,
i
think
it's
noteworthy
that
congress
obviously
knew
that
concessioners
would
be
building
buildings
under
the
1998
act,
which
was
enacted
against
the
backdrop
of
this
regulation
setting
forth
the
park
service's
consistently
held
view
that
concessions
contracts
are
not
procurement
contracts.
and
far
from
displacing
that
view,
they
actually
seem
to
embrace
it
both
in
the
text
of
the
act
and
in
the
legislative
history
that
justice
breyer
mentioned.
as
far
as
the
text
of
the
act
goes,
i
think
it's
telling
that...
the
different
types
of
language
they
use
for
both
the
concessions
side
of
the
house
and
the
procurement
side
of
the
house.
on
the
concessions
side,
they
use
distinct
language
that
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
find
in
any
procurement
statute
anywhere.
instead
of
saying
procure
or
purchase,
they
say
they...
the...
the
park
service
can
authorize
concessioners
to
provide
services,
and
it
even
specifies
that
the
services
will
not
be
provided
to
the
government.
it
says
they're
provided
to
visitors,
which
is
obviously
very
different
from
procurement
statutes,
many
of
which
specifically
state
that
the
service
will
be
provided
to
the
agency.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
no.
that...
justice...
justice
scalia,
that's
the
actual
text
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
and
by
contrast
with
that,
the
actual
text
of
the
procurement
provisions
of
the
1998...
section
5959,
used
typical
procurement
language
and
specified
that
the
park
service
will
be
benefitting
from
it.
it
says
that
the...
that
the
service
can
enter
into
management
consultant
agreements
whereby
management
consultants
provide
services
to
assist
the
secretary
in
administering
the
program.
so
it's
a
contrast
both...
i
think
in
both
ways.
finally,
one
other
thing
that
i
think
is
telling
is
that
congress
specifically
provided
that
some
of
the
most
likely
to
arise
disputes
under
the
act,
including
specifically
franchise-free
disputes,
which
i
think
people
would
think
would...
would
arise
frequently,
would
be
subject
to
mandatory
arbitration.
and
if
congress
had
thought
there
was
an
administrative
remedy
for
this
under
the
cda,
i
just
don't
think
there
would
be
any
need
for
them
to
provide
for
an...
a
mandatory
arbitral
remedy.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that
is
correct.
under
602(a)(4),
the...
when
the
government
disposes
of
property
that
is
not...
when
the
government...
government
disposes
of
personal
property,
those
sales
are
covered
by
the
cda.
however,
petitioner
has
never
raised
that
theory
in
this
court...
in
any
court.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
no,
but
they...
they
don't
purport
to
be.
if
you
look
at
the
cda,
the
word
procurement
is
always
used
in
the
clause
for
procurement
of
services,
procurement
of
construction,
repair.
and...
and
that
was
tacked
on
at
the
end
basically
because
gsa
at
the
time
subjected
sales
contracts
to
the
same
dispute
clause,
that
was
problematic,
that
procurement
contracts
were.
but
that
still...
in
order
to
get
coverage
under
the
cda
under
petitioner's
theory,
they
still
must
be
a
procurement
contract
or
must
involve
the
procurement
of
services.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court.
