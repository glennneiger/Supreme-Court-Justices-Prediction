justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
was
it
treated
on
the
court's
docket?
i
mean,
the...
something
was
going
on.
there
was
a
request
for
a
stay.
there
was
a
request
for
the
appointment
of
counsel.
so
something
was
initiated,
and
what
was
that
something
called?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
how
it
was
in
fact?
how
was
it
treated
on
the
court's
docket?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
it
given
a
case
name
and
a
file?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
would
that
number
indicate
that
it
was
a
habeas
petition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
was
on
the
docket
as
a
habeas
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
not
good
enough.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
everyone
had
focused
on
aedpa,
which
they
didn't
because
it
wasn't
enacted
at
the
time
all
this
started,
then
maybe
the
district
judge
would
have
made
the
time
lines
different.
and
the
district
court
had
a
proceeding
before
it
with
a
number.
it
was
classified
a
habeas
case.
and
the
district
court
set
a
rather
relaxed
schedule.
he
gave
the
counsel,
appointed
counsel,
many
months
to
file
the
actual
petition.
and
if
everybody
had
known
that
the...
that
the
time
the
district
judge
gave
would
mean
that
aedpa
would
apply,
then
i
assume
counsel,
being
diligent,
would
have
said,
don't
give
me
that
much
time.
i
have
to
get
this
in
quickly.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
want
aedpa
to
apply,
if
you're
diligent
counsel,
because
the
standards
are
much
tighter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
how
many
cases
fall
in
this
category?
this
is
a
transition
case
caught
in
between.
no
aedpa
when
it
all
started;
aedpa
in
the
middle
before
the
petition
is
filed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
cases
are
in
that
category?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
45
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it's
a
vanishing
problem
in
any
event.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
specify
what
were
the
pre-petition...
i
thought
that
there
was...
there
was
also
something
submitted
by
counsel,
a
kind
of
skeletal
statement
of
issues,
and...
and
because
there
was
an
adversary
proceeding,
was
there
not?
the...
the
state
moved
to
dismiss
the
stay.
and
something
what...
was
something
different
submitted
by
garceau
himself
earlier,
and
then
something
by
counsel
later?
what
was
the
sequence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
statement
of
issues
was
filed
pre-aedpa.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
some
proceeding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
once
the
issue...
the
statement
of
issues...
once
that
was
filed,
then
there
was
no
response?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it...
it
would
be
interlocutory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if...
if
the
district
judge
said,
all
right,
i
accept
these,
you've
got
a
non-frivolous
issue,
at
that
point,
the
state
couldn't
go
up
to
the
appellate
court
because
it
would
be
very...
it
would
be
interlocutory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
have
a
question
about
this...
the
proceeding.
aedpa
was
pending
when
this
was
going
on,
and
the
counsel
that
represented
this
petitioner
was
the
same
counsel
who
represented
him
in
the
state
court.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
knowing
that
aedpa
was
on
the
front
burner,
counsel
having
some
familiarity
with
the
case,
why
did
they
use
all
the
time
that
the
district
court
gave
them
instead
of
filing
before
aedpa
went
into
effect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
even
under
aedpa,
if
you
just
come
in
at
the
threshold,
the
court...
the
federal
court,
in
general,
is
quite
liberal
about
letting
you
develop
the
facts
necessary
to
present
your
claim.
it
may
be
a
problem
with
amending
a
petition
in
habeas,
but
your
point,
i
take
it,
is
that
you
can't
envision
any
real
harm
to
any
of
your
clients
if
the
starting
date
of
aedpa
would
be
considered
the
filing
of
the
stay
application
and
the
request
for
counsel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--suppose
garceau
had
filed
a
handwritten
thing,
and
he
called
it
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
and
it
had
the
same
thing
as
the
statement
of
issues?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
there
have
been
a
problem
then
for
counsel,
once
counsel
is
appointed?
and
my
scenario
is
garceau
files
his
own
petition,
it's
handwritten,
and
it's
got
one...
one
issue.
then
the
lawyer
is
appointed,
and
a
dandy
petition
is
filed
with
28
issues.
would
that...
would
be
any
problem
about
that
being
considered
a
successive
petition?
