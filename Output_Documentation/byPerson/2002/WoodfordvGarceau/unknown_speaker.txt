unknown
speaker
it's
the
difference
between
a
case
and
a
proceeding.
how...
how
do
you
get
us
here
under
the
words
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
mcfarland
was
a
totally
different
statute
from
aedpa,
was
it
not?
it...
it
was...
it's
a
totally
separate
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
really,
what
we're
trying
to
interpret
here,
i
take
it,
is
the
meaning
of
some
of
the
language
in
lindh.
we're...
we're
not
talking
about
any
specific
language
in...
even
in
aedpa.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
would
we
look
to
the
express
terms
of
the
statute
when
lindh
itself
didn't
rely
on
any
express
terms
of
this
statute?
why
wouldn't
we
look
to...
to
what
makes
sense
with
respect
to
the
rule
that
we
have
created?
unknown
speaker
well,
counsel
didn't
have
to
take
all
the
time
that
the
district
court
allowed,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
do
you
happen
to
know...
that
was
a
very
good
answer.
do
you
happen
to
know
the
number
of
cases
in
the
other
circuits
if
we
ruled
the
other--
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you...
are
you
saying,
ms.
coffin,
that
mcfarland
is
controlling
in
the
very
strict
sense
of
the
word
here,
that
if...
we
must
rule
in
your
favor
without
looking
anywhere
else
just
because
of
the
decision
in
mcfarland?
unknown
speaker
when...
when
did
congress
pass
the
law
that...
that
overturned
the
result
in
mcfarland?
you
say
they
passed
a
law
that
overturned
the
result?
unknown
speaker
okay.
and
they...
they
haven't
dealt
with
the
issue
of
mcfarland.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
is
that
supported
by
something
in,
say,
the
legislative
history,
or
is
that
just
your...
your
own
view
of
what
must
have
happened?
unknown
speaker
but
it's...
it's
not
at
all
an
unusual
phenomenon
that...
that
a
word
in...
in
statutes
has
different
application
in
different
contexts
where
you--
we
had
a
case
the
other
day.
when
is
something
final?
congress
says,
you
know,
when...
when
it's
final.
it
depends
on
what
the
context
is,
and
nothing...
nothing
says
that
just
because
you...
you
think
that
the
case
for
one
purpose,
for
the
mcfarland
purpose,
begins
with
the...
with
the
initial
filings,
for...
for
all
purposes
it
has
to
begin
there.
and
what
impresses
me
about
this
case
is
that
i
don't
see
what
is
gained
by
extending
the
inapplicability
of
aedpa
earlier
than
the
filing
of
the
habeas
petition
because
the
purpose
of...
of
the
non-retroactivity
provision
is
certainly
not
to
cause
somebody
to
be
frustrated
in
actions
that
he
took
in
reliance
upon
the
prior
law.
and...
and
a...
a
habeas
applicant
could
be
frustrated
in
events
that
occur
after
the
filing
of
his
habeas
petition.
but
all
of
the
events
prior
to
that
filing
that
were
covered
by
mcfarland,
they
aren't
covered
by
aedpa
anyway.
aedpa
could
not
possibly
affect
those
earlier
events.
so...
so
nothing...
nothing
is
served
by
making
the
retroactivity
go
back
further.
unknown
speaker
right.
but
they
had
another...
there...
there
is
also
another
part
to
that,
and
that
is,
they
determined
that
certain
cases
would
not
be
covered
by
aedpa.
and
so--
--well,
those
cases...
those
cases,
in
which
they
did
not
want
to
frustrate
legitimate
expectations.
but
my
point
is,
there
is
no
possible
legitimate
expectation
that
would
be
frustrated
by
aedpa
in
the
pre-application
stage.
aedpa
simply
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
that.
unknown
speaker
okay.
you're
back
to
that
argument,
but
on
that
argument,
you
know,
what's
a
case
depends
on
the
context.
unknown
speaker
the...
the
congress
obviously
thought
that
this
was
a...
that
aedpa
was
a
preferred
regime,
and
you
are
delaying
what
congress
has
found
a
preferred
regime.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
that...
but
that's
just
not
true
that...
that
we
give
a
word
the
same
meaning
in
all
contexts.
we...
we
evidently
don't.
there
are
so
many
instances
of
that,
that
your
argument
cannot...
cannot
rely
just
upon
that.
and
it
seems
to
me
all
of
the
other
courts
that
have
come
out
the
other
way
from
the
ninth
circuit
have
done
so
for
a
very
sensible
reason,
and
that
is
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained,
nothing
whatever
to
be
gained,
by
refusing...
or
by...
by
refusing
to
apply
aedpa
to
these
pre-petition
activities
inasmuch
as
aedpa
cannot
affect
them
at
all.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
not...
not
to
any
decision
that
is
taken
before
the
filing
of
the...
of
the
formal
habeas
application.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
excuse
me.
there
was...
but
that
was
also
after
the
application
for
habeas
corpus
had
been
filed.
no?
no.
unknown
speaker
in
order
to
get
counsel
appointed.
unknown
speaker
isn't
this--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
ex
parte?
unknown
speaker
and
it...
so
is
it
generally
argued
whether
or
not
these
are
non-frivolous
issues?
unknown
speaker
see,
that...
that's
why
i
thought
there--
--could
any...
could
any
of
those...
of
those
events
that
you've
just
described,
pre-filing
of
the
habeas,
conceivably
be
affected
by
aedpa?
is
there
any
way
that
aedpa
could
have
disappointed
expectations
with
regard
to
that
pre-application
activity?
unknown
speaker
--are
the
state
court's
determinations
reviewable?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
the
state
court
appoints--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
outcome
of
an
early
stage
where
you
file
the
petition.
unknown
speaker
i
wasn't
even
aware
that
these
things
were
reviewable.
you...
you
mean
to
say
that
you
get
judicial
review
of
whether,
when
counsel
is
appointed,
the...
the
trial
court
allows
counsel
to
proceed
with
a
habeas?
you...
you
can
take
that
up
on
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
just
go
ahead
and
what
ultimately
is
reviewed
is
the...
is
the
substantive
disposition
of
the
habeas
application?
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
but
what
if
the
district
court
determined
that
these
were
non-frivolous
issues?
does
the
state
have
any
right
to
appeal
that
determination?
has
it
ever
happened?
unknown
speaker
can
the
state
file
a
responsive
pleading?
unknown
speaker
do
the...
do
such
hearings
occur?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
if
there
had
been
a
response,
the
state
had
lost,
and
the
state
wanted
to
contest
it,
could
the
state
take
that
up?
unknown
speaker
you
just
answered
a
minute
ago
to
my
question
that
they
couldn't.
unknown
speaker
has...
you...
you
don't
know
that
it's
ever
been
done.
unknown
speaker
help
me
out
and...
and
tell
me
what...
what
portion
of...
of
aedpa
would
apply
to
this
pre-application
event.
unknown
speaker
(d)
says,
an
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
behalf
of
a
person
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
state
court
shall
not
be
granted
with
respect
to
any
claim
that
was
adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
state
court
proceedings.
well,
that...
that
provision
certainly
wouldn't
apply
to
any...
there...
nothing
has
been...
been
adjudicated
on
the
merits.
right?
unknown
speaker
would
you
call
that
an
adjudication
on
the
merits?
just
the
preliminary
determination
that
there
is
or
is
not
a
frivolous
issue
here?
i...
i
wouldn't
call
that
a...
a
determination
on
the
merits.
so
i
don't
think
(d)
would
apply.
what
about
(e)?
(e)
says,
in...
in
a
proceeding
instituted
by
an
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
by
a
person
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
a
state
court,
a
determination
of
a
factual
issue
made
by
a
state
court
shall
be
presumed
to
be
correct.
are
there
factual
issues
decided
in
these...
in...
in
these--
unknown
speaker
--pre-applications?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
even
if
aedpa
had
been...
had
been
applicable,
your
client
still
should
have
prevailed.
unknown
speaker
well,
lindh
was
a
similar
case,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
ms....
ms.
coffin,
you...
you
have
to
make
the
best
argument
for
your
client
here,
and...
and
you're
doing
that.
but
it
strikes
me
that...
that
there...
this
is
sort
of
a
mixed
bag,
that
actually,
in
agreeing
with
you,
we
would
probably
be...
be
harming
most
capital
defendants,
that
is
to
say,
your
client
will
win
on
this
retroactivity
point
which
will
eventually
vanish.
it's
a...
it's
a
temporary
problem.
but
the
effect
of
our
holding
that...
that
the
habeas
action
for
purposes
of
aedpa
commences
with
the...
the
initial
request
for
counsel
is
that
all...
all
of
the
transactions...
i
mean,
if...
if
that
provision
that
all
factual
determinations
by
the
state
court
must
be
deemed
to
be
correct,
that
means
that
aedpa
would,
in
the
future,
apply
to
those...
to
those
determinations.
whereas,
if
we
came
out
the
other
way,
until
the
habeas
application
is...
is
applied,
the
strictures
of
aedpa
don't...
are...
are
not
applicable.
so,
you
know,
it's
a...
it's...
it's
not
a...
not
a
win-win
game,
but
it
is
for
your
client,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
the...
the
proceedings
that
took
place
between
the
appointment
of
counsel,
which
involved
the...
whether
the...
the
statement
as
to
the
kind
of
issues
and
so
forth
and
the
state's
motion
to
vacate
the
stay
and
so
forth...
were
they
all
given
the
same
number
that
justice
ginsburg
referred
to
earlier?
and
then
after
the
habeas
application
itself
was
filed,
was
the
case
given
a
different
number,
or
was
the
same
number
continued?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes--
unknown
speaker
ms.
mclean,
we've
been
talking
about
the
statement
of
non-frivolous
issues
that's
filed.
in
your
view...
and
i...
i
would
assume,
at
least
for
purposes
of
my
question,
that
aedpa
might
make
a
difference,
that
it
might
be
non-frivolous
before
aedpa,
but...
but
then
frivolous
after.
i'm
assuming
that
could
be
true
because
of
clear...
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standing,
for
instance.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm...
i...
i
take
it
the
district
court
is
interested.
that's
because
they...
that's
why
they
require
this
filing...
whether
or
not
there's
going
to
be
anything
here
for
the
court
to
adjudicate.
is
there
some
substantial
issue?
and
the
point
of
my
question
was
going
to
be
let's
assume
that
post
and
pre-aedpa,
the
standard
of
frivolity
changes.
let's
assume
that.
or
non-frivolity.
would
you
say
that
there
is
an
expectation
that's
legitimate
and
that
exists
if
there's
a
filing
of
a
statement
of
non-frivolous
issues
pre-aedpa
and
then
before
the
complaint
is
filed...
before
the
petition
is
filed,
aedpa
comes
into
effect?
would
you
say
an
expectation
has
been
established?
unknown
speaker
the
only
expectation
is
you'll
get
a
stay
until
you
file
your
petition.
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
why--
--would
you
just
confirm
for
me
the...
the
language
of
153
applies
to
an
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
okay.
that's
(d)
and
also
(e)
in
a
proceeding
instituted
by
an
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
now,
that...
that
was
not
quite
the
language
involved
in
mcfarland,
was
it?
what
was
the
language
involved
in
mcfarland?
unknown
speaker
before
whom
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
is
pending.
i
think--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
instituted
by
an
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
means
just
that.
it
has
to
be
instituted
by
the
application.
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
you
described
the...
the
state
proceeding
as,
quote,
tremendously
litigated,
close.
what
did
that...
what
did
that
involve?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
there
also
a
request
for
funds?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
before
the...
before
the
habeas
corpus
petition
was
filed,
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
now?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
that
whether
or
not
this
case
is
governed
by
aedpa,
aedpa
has
no
effect
whatever
on
all
of
that.
unknown
speaker
by
its
terms,
it
simply
does
not
affect
it.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
it--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i...
i
quite
agree.
but
if...
if
the
state
decided
that
it
simply
was
going
to
be
less
complacent
at
the
stage
at
which
there
is
a
request
for
stay
and
said,
okay,
we're
going...
we're
going
to
start
contesting
the
non-frivolous
character
of
these...
these
claims
that
are
being
raised,
number
one,
wouldn't
the
state
be
able
to
do
that
if
it
thought
it
was
worthwhile
to
spend
its
time
doing
that?
and
number
two,
if
it
did
that,
wouldn't
the
ultimate
standard
of
persuasion
that
aedpa
applies
have
an
effect
on...
on
the
argument
that
you
would
make
as
to
what
was
or
was
non-frivolous
at
that
stage?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
you're
saying
it
isn't
having
an
effect.
it...
it--
unknown
speaker
--you're
saying
that,
in
fact,
in
california,
it
is
not
having
such
an
effect.
unknown
speaker
yes.
