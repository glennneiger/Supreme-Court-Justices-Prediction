justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
part
i
wonder.
i
was
thinking
that
if
it's
open
to...
pend...
the...
the
case...
what
is
it
called?
is
it...
mcfarland...
suggests
that
it's
at
least
open
to
calling
this
pending.
it's
a
possible
construction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then...
and
then
it
being
a
possible
construction,
i
wonder,
well,
there
was
an
awful
lot
of
proceeding
that
went
on
here.
there
was
a
stay.
it
was
opposed.
and
all
of
this
took
place
before
the...
the
petition
was
filed.
so
if
the
purpose
of
aedpa,
at
least
as
we've
interpreted
it,
is
to
stay
away
from
proceedings
that
were
already
underway,
this
would
seem
to
have
been
well
underway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
that's
what
i
want
you
to
address
precisely.
that's
where
i'm
uncertain.
it
seems
as
if
the
language...
you
could...
you
could...
you
could...
the
language
is
open
to
either
interpretation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
yet...
well,
you...
you
think
it's
more
strong
in
your
direction.
i...
i
understand
that.
but
if...
say,
if
it's
open
to
either
interpretation,
then
why
doesn't
the
purpose
of
the
application
provisions,
as
we've
interpreted
them,
suggest
don't
apply
it
where
proceedings
are
well
underway,
which
would
mean
the
other
side
would
win
here.
that's
why
i'm
asking
you.
i
want
to
see
what
your
response
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
is
it
true,
by
the
way...
is...
is
that
the
case
or
not
that...
i'm
interested
in
the
question...
that...
that
if
in
fact
aedpa
applies
to
a...
aedpa
does...
there's
a
difference
whether
aedpa
does...
does
it
make
a
difference
if
aedpa
applies
or
not
to
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
does
make
just
as
much
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
case.
in
your
case.
a
person
files
a
petition
asking
for
a
lawyer,
and
then
we
have
a
lot
of
litigation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
should
there
be
a
stay?
should
there
not
be
a
stay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
guess
the
answer
to
that
could
affect
a
later
determination
in
the
case.
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i
mean,
that's...
what
i
don't...
i'm
a
petitioner.
i
ask
for
a
lawyer.
the
judge
says,
do
you
have
any
non-frivolous
claim?
he
says,
sure,
this
is
it,
and
you
list
them.
now,
if,
in
fact,
aedpa's
in
effect,
we're
going
to
apply
a
pretty
lenient
standard
in
reviewing
the
state
court
determinations
on
those
issues,
but
if
aedpa
isn't
in
effect,
we're--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
sorry.
what
i
was
thinking
is
that
if
the
standard
for
reviewing
the
state
court
determinations
is
different,
depending
on
whether
you
apply
aedpa
or
not,
i
don't
see
why,
in
principle,
that
couldn't
affect
the
outcome
of
a
judge's
decision
as
to
whether
the
issue
in
the
petition
in
front
of
me
is
or
is
not
a
frivolous
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
think
in
principle
it
could
affect
the
outcome.
in
fact,
probably...
i
don't
know
if
it
did
or
not,
but
i...
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
that
affecting
the
outcome
there--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you...
forgetting
the...
the...
i...
i'm
still
slightly
confused
on
what
i'd
call
the
practical
point.
imagine
on
january
1,
before
aedpa
is
passed,
they
file
a
petition...
no,
not
a
petition...
a
petition
for
a
lawyer.
and
there's
stay
applications.
and
everything
under
the
sun
is
litigated
on
that
stay
application,
as
it
often
is
in
a
capital
case.
on
june
1,
once
the
stay
was
granted,
they
file
their
official
habeas
petition.
on
december
1,
aedpa
is
enacted.
now,
the
question
is
whether
aedpa
will
govern
future
proceedings
in
the
case.
and
what
we've
said
is
it
doesn't
govern
those
future
proceedings
if,
in
fact,
that
petition
had
been
filed
on
june
1.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i'm
saying
the
petition
for
habeas.
the
habeas
is
pending
as
of
the
time
that
aedpa
was
there.
the
petition
for
habeas
was
filed
on
june
1.
the
petition
for
the
lawyer
and
so
forth
was
filed
6
months
before.
am
i
right?
maybe
i
mixed
up
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
filed...
the
habeas
petition
applies...
was
filed,
and
habeas
proceedings
are
underway,
and
then
later
on
aedpa
is
enacted,
does
aedpa
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
the
habeas
petition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
aedpa.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
now,
what
i'm
saying
is...
is
january
1,
they
ask
for
a
lawyer
and
then
they
go
through
the
stay.
on
june
1
they
file
the
habeas
petition.
on
december
1,
aedpa
is
enacted.
now,
we
don't
apply
it
to
that
case
because
the
habeas
proceeding
was
underway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
why
don't
we?
because
that
judge
might
have
made
up
his
mind
about
various
things
because
there
could
have
been
things
decided.
now,
why
isn't
precisely
the
same
thing
true
as
to
the
period
january
1
to
june
1,
where
all
kinds
of
things
were
decided,
the
stay
was
litigated,
the
judge
has
made
up
his
mind,
who
knows
how
it
affected
the
future
proceedings?
that's
what...
do
you
see
the
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
get
the
linguistic
point.
that's
why
i
said
that
i
wanted
to
know
the
practical
point,
which
i
think
maybe
justice
kennedy's
question
was
trying
to
get
at;
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
what
had
happened
here
was
that
the
petitioner
asks
for
a
lawyer
and
a
stay,
and
then
the
district
court
granted
the
stay.
then
the
state
came
in
and
said,
we
want
you
to
vacate
the
stay.
and
then,
the
district
court
asked
the
petitioner
to
file
the
non-frivolous
issues,
et
cetera,
and
so
there
was
a
considerable
argument
about
whether
the
stay
should
be
vacated
or
not
vacated,
which
i
guess
eventually
the
petitioner
won.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
sounded
to
me
like
a
fairly
substantial
proceeding.
