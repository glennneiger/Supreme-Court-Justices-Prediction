does
the

have
a
right
to
be

the...
the
question
is
whether
the
stay
will
be
continued.
the
specification
of
non-frivolous
issues
is
filed.
if
the
state
says
these
are
frivolous
issues,
can
the
state
be
heard?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
ultimately
beside
the
point
that
aedpa
itself
doesn't
say
anything
about
this...
the
so-called
pre-petition,
the
stay
stage?
because
if
your
stay
is
dependent
upon
the
specification
of
non-frivolous
issues,
and
frivolousness
has
some
reference
to
the
standards
that
you're
going
to
have
to
meet
for
success
and
aedpa
affects
those
standards,
doesn't,
as
a
matter
of...
of
implication,
doesn't
aedpa
affect
your
frivolousness
standard
and
hence
have
at
least
a
potential
effect
at
the
stay
point?
