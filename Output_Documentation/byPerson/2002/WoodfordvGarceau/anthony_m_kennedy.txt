m.
kennedy
well,
in
your...
in
your
answer
to
justice
scalia,
you
said,
well,
you're
not
sure
about
the
harm,
but
the
harm
exists,
it...
it
seems
to
me,
in
not
giving
full
effect
to
the
congressional
scheme.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
a
harm
in
that
sense,
maybe
not
the
harm
in
a
particular
case
that
would
come
out
one
way
or
the
other,
but
you
are
delaying
the
effectiveness
of...
of
a
congressional
scheme.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
for...
for
the
reasons
given.
we...
we
want...
we
want
cases
that
have...
where
the
merits
have
been
addressed
to
be
decided
under
the...
the
law
before
it
was
changed
by
aedpa.
