the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-1862,
woodford
against
garceau
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
lindh
versus
murphy,
we
held
that
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996
does
not
apply
to
cases
already
pending
in
federal
court
on
april
24,
1996.
that
was
the
effective
date.
in
this
case,
we
consider
when
a
capital
habeas
case
becomes
pending
for
purposes
of
the
rule
announced
in
lindh.
respondent
brutally
killed
his
girlfriend
and
her
14-year-old
son.
he
was
convicted
of
first-degree
murder
and
was
sentenced
to
death.
after
california
courts
denied
his
request
for
post
conviction
relief,
respondent
turned
to
the
federal
courts
filing
a
motion
for
appointment
of
federal
habeas
counsel
and
an
application
for
stay
of
execution.
subsequently,
respondent
filed
an
actual
habeas
corpus
application.
the
district
court
concluded
that
because
the
motion
for
counsel
and
the
stay
application
had
been
filed
before
aedpa's
effective
date,
the
respondent’s
habeas
application
was
not
subject
to
aedpa,
even
though
the
application
itself
had
been
filed
after
aedpa
became
effective.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
departing
from
the
conclusion
reached
by
five
other
courts
of
appeals.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
remand
for
further
proceeding.
aedpa
places
heavy
emphasis
on
the
standards
governing
the
review
of
the
merits
of
the
habeas
application,
and
the
rule
announced
in
lindh
should
be
interpreted
in
light
of
this
emphasis.
accordingly,
aedpa
does
not
apply
if
on
aedpa’s
effective
date,
a
state
prisoner
had
before
federal
court
a
habeas
petition
seeking
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
of
the
petitioner’s
claims.
by
contrast,
however,
an
application
filed
after
aedpa’s
effective
date
should
be
reviewed
under
aedpa
even
if
other
filings
by
that
same
applicant
such
as
a
request
or
appointment
of
counsel
or
a
motion
for
stay
of
execution
were
presented
to
a
federal
court
prior
to
aedpa’s
effective
date.
i
am
sure
you
got
all
of
that.
one
of
my
colleagues
said
that
this
case
is
about
how
aedpa
violates
erisa.
i
am
not
going
to
say
which
of
my
colleagues
but
he
sits
to
my
left.
here,
respondent’s
habeas
corpus
application
was
not
filed
in
federal
court
until
after
aedpa’s
effective
date.
accordingly,
that
application
is
subject
to
aedpa.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
breyer
join.
