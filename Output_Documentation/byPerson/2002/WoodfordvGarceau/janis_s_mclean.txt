ms.
janis
s.
mclean
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
lindh
versus
murphy,
this
court
held
that
chapter
153
was
non-retroactive
to
cases
pending
at
the
time
of
aedpa's
enactment.
in
the
general
run
of
habeas
cases,
this
is
determined
by
the
filing
date
of
the
application
for
habeas
relief.
this
case
will
resolve
a
split
between
the
five
circuits
that
apply
this
rule
to
capital
cases
and
the
ninth
circuit
which,
instead,
looks
to
the
date
the
pre-application
motion
for
counsel
was
filed
in
a
capital
case.
we
believe
that
the
five
circuits
are
correct.
neither
chapter
153
nor
lindh
versus
murphy
identifies
the
commencement
event
that
triggers
the
application
of
chapter
153.
in
light
of
this,
we
must
determine
congress'
intent,
and
the
first
place
to
look
is
to
the
express
terms
of
chapter
153
and,
of
course,
aedpa's
purposes
to
expedite
habeas
cases
and
to
provide
greater
deferential
review
to
state...
state
criminal
convictions.
chapter
153
by
its
terms
can
only
apply
to
a
merits
petition.
it
repeatedly
contains
express
language,
such
as
that
contained
in
2244(d),
which
is
found
at
petitioner's
appendix
185,
which
concerns
the
statute
of
limitations
provisions
and
provides
that
the
statute
of
limitations
applies
to
the
application
for
habeas
relief.
similarly,
the
standard
of
review
in
2254(d)
at
petitioner's
appendix
191--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--your
honor,
i
believe
that...
that
these
are
easily
reconciled.
i
believe
that
it...
that
there's
a...
i
think
the
habeas
proceedings
can
be...
are
unique
and
can
be
extended.
they
can
also
be
divided
into...
into
segments.
the
first
phase
is
the
pre-application
phase,
which
is
what
mcfarland
was
concerned
about.
in
that
case,
this
court
was
concerned
about
providing,
pursuant
to
21
u.s.c.
848...
concerned
about
the
pre-application
grant
of
counsel
to
habeas
petitioners.
but
that
is
entirely
separable
from
the
merits
proceeding
that
occurs
after
the
filing
of
the...
of
the
petition
itself
which
brings
the
merits
before
the
court.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
the...
actually,
the
provisions
of
chapter
153
themselves
do
not
contain
the
word
case.
that...
we
only
come
to
that
term
at
all
because
in
this
court's
opinion
in
lindh,
the
court
looked
to...
created
a...
viewed
the...
as
being
a
negative
inference
from
the
absence
of
the
pending
cases
language
that
appears
in
the
154
provisions.
the
153
provisions
do
not
have
that...
those...
that
term
in
them.
instead,
they
use
the
specific
express
words
of
an
application.
they
clearly
apply
to
an
application.
and
the
case...
that's
reconcilable
because
the
portion
of
the
case
that
we're
talking
about
is
the
merits
portion
of
the...
of
the
case.
this
court
recognized
that
there
can
be
multiple
cases
in
a
habeas
proceeding.
in
slack
versus
mcdaniel,
the
court
recognized
that
there
could
be
a
separate
appellate
case
that--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--that
would...
it
could
be
characterized
as...
you
could
use
the
word
case.
you
could
use
the
word
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
it--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--it
was...
it
was
certainly
given
a
case
name
and
assigned
a
case
number,
undoubtedly,
but
i
do
not--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--i'm
sure
it
did
because
our
courts
in
california,
the...
the
district
courts
have
numbers
that
specify
that
it's
a
habeas
proceeding.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
that's
correct.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
that's
not
determinative.
what
i'm...
my
position
is,
or
our
position
is,
is
that
these...
that
the
habeas
proceeding
is
unique
and
extended.
it
includes
three
phases;
includes
the
pre-application
phase,
which
is
the...
what
mcfarland
was
concerned
about.
it...
it
then
has
the
merits
application
phase
that
begins
with
the
filing
of
the
application
for
habeas
relief.
it
then
also
has
the
appellate
phase.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
well,
we're
concerned
about...
lindh
used
the
phrase
that...
that
there
was
non-retroactivity
of
chapter
153
to
cases...
to
cases
pending
under
153.
so
the
question
is,
what
is
the
commencement
event
that
we
talked
about,
that...
that
we're
referring
to?
what...
what
creates
the
pending
case
for
purposes
of
chapter
153?
for
that,
we
have
to
look
back
to
the
express
terms
of
the
statute.
since
153
can...
doesn't
apply
to
the...
the
pre-application
phase--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--i
would
agree
with
that,
that
the...
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
the
absence
of...
in
the
absence
of
language...
there's
clearly
an
absence
of
language
in
153
that
addresses
this
commencement
event.
so
that
puts
us
into
a
position
of
looking
to
see
what
congress
intended
based
on
what
the
express
words
of
chapter
153
are.
is...
is
there
anything
in
chapter
153
that
tells
us
that,
no,
we
didn't
mean
the...
the...
a
commencement
of
a
habeas
proceeding
based
on
the
filing
of
an
application?
we
meant
something
earlier,
i.e.,
the
motion
for...
for
a
request
for
appointment
of
counsel.
and
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
simply
no.
there
is
nothing
in
chapter
153
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
pre-application
proceeding.
those
provisions,
as
is
demonstrated
by
their
terms
and
also
the
habeas
corpus
rules
concerning
chapter
2254
cases...
those
only
can
apply...
expressly
apply
to
applications
for
habeas
relief.
they
do
not
apply
to
any
earlier
event,
and
it
doesn't...
it
thwarts
the
purposes
of
aedpa
by...
by
unduly
confining
the
number
of
cases
covered
by
it,
capital
cases
covered
by
it.
it--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--yes,
it's
a
possible
construction.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
it
was...
the...
the
proceeding
was
well
underway,
but
that
doesn't...
is
not
determinative
in...
in
the
sense
that
counsel
had
been
appointed
and
a
petition
was
in
the
works.
but
that--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--i
don't--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--in
order
to
deviate
from...
from
the
normal...
also,
there
is
no
question
that
in...
in
the
general
run
of
habeas
cases,
it's
triggered
by
the
filing
of
the
application.
so
the
question
is
whether
there's
some
justification,
some
harm
that
would
be
caused
by
not...
by
treating
them...
them
being
the
capital
cases...
under
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
differently
than
we
do
the
normal
run
of
habeas
cases.
and
there's
nothing
about
the
fact
that
a
counsel
had
been
appointed
or
that...
that
a
application
was
in
the
works,
but
not
yet
filed,
that
would
prevent
us
or
harm
in
any
way
those
petitioners
from
ultimately
being
subject
to
the
greater
standards
of
deferential
review
that...
that
aedpa
ultimately
imposed.
there's
no
harm
whatsoever.
and
it
doesn't
further...
it
thwarts
the
purposes
of
aedpa
to
do
that.
it...
it
also
creates
a
subclass
of
capital
defendants
who
are
treated
differently--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--this
case
that's
before
the
court
does
not
involve
the
statute
of
limitations,
however.
the
concerns
that
you're
expressing
would
be
valid--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--it
does
affect
the
standards
of
review,
but
they
don't--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--he
did
not
need
to,
but
he...
he
was
fully
compliant.
to
the
extent
that
the
court's
concern
here
appears
to
this
counsel
to
be
concerned
about
the
statute
of
limitations,
there
was
no
issue
here.
this
case
came
in
timely.
and
in
fact,
in
the
ninth
circuit,
they
followed
the
same
rule
that
all
the
other
five
circuits
followed
all
the
way
up
until
1998.
so
really
the
statute
of
limitations
is
virtually
a
non-issue
in
this
situation.
this
case
did...
the...
the...
any
delays
or
long
periods
of
times
that
were
granted
or
anything
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
there
is
no
harm
in
this
case.
the
only
issue
is
that
now,
once
this
case
was
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
ninth
circuit,
should
it
be
subject
to
the
deferential
standards
of
review
that
aedpa
imposed,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
there
was
no...
there
is
absolutely
no
harm
in
now
saying
that
because
the
filing
of
the
application
came
in
after
the
enactment
of
aedpa,
that
it
should
be
subject,
just
as
all
other
habeas
cases
are,
to--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--that's
correct.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
we
believe...
we
believe
that
it
affects
approximately...
in
the
ninth
circuit,
particularly
in
california,
it
affects
approximately
45
capital
cases.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
it
also...
it
also,
of
course,
affects
the
other...
those
cases,
those
capital
cases,
that
are
covered
by
the
other
circuits
which
currently
use...
all
of
which,
other
than
the
ninth
circuit,
as
to
those
45
cases,
use
the
filing
date
of
the
application.
so
if
the
court,
obviously,
was
to
choose
the
position
advocated
by
respondent,
it
would
change
the
standard
of
review
from
aedpa
to
non-aedpa
in
those
states
covered
by
those
circuits.
in
the
ninth
circuit,
what
will...
would
happen
if
you
adopted
the
position
that
i'm
advocating
is
that
you...
that
those
45
cases
in
california,
approximately
45
cases
in
california,
will
now
become
aedpa
cases.
and
that
will
primarily
affect
the
standard
of
review
that
is
applied
to
them.
garceau--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--i'm...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
that's
certainly
true,
but
it's
very
important.
garceau
is
the
perfect
example
of
why
this
is
an
important
issue
for
this
court,
the...
in
garceau,
the...
the
state...
the
state
supreme
court
issued
a
very
well-reasoned
opinion
issuing...
saying
that
it
had
decided
that
error
was
harmless,
upholding
the
conviction
that
occurred
in
this
case.
it
went
through
the
district
court.
the
district
court
agreed.
it
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
in
2001...
this
was
a
1984
killing.
in...
in
2001,
it
was
reversed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
which
did...
because
it
did
not
believe
it
was
an
aedpa
case,
refused
to
apply
the
deferential
standard
of
review,
refused
to
apply
the
precedents
of
this
court,
instead
looked
at
its
own...
its
own
cases,
and
reversed
it.
and
this
is...
you
know,
this
is
the
most
important...
a
capital
conviction
in
california
is
the
most
important
cases...
some
of
the
most
important
cases
that
that
state
issues.
and...
and
to
have
that
reversed
for
the
failure
to
apply
this...
the
standards
that
congress
imposed
in
1996
is
a
very,
very
serious
matter.
and
that's
just
one
case.
it's
happened
in
other
cases.
and...
and
so,
we
believe
that
it's
very
important
to
have
this
issue
straightened
out.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
your
honor,
i
do.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
thank
you.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
there's
nothing
in
aedpa
that
applies
whatsoever
to
the
pre-application
period.
the
deferential
provisions
of
2254(d)
can
only
apply
once
an
application
is
filed
by
its
express
terms.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
no.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
that
document
that
is
filed
is
so
skeletal
that
it
absolutely
bears
no
resemblance
to
a...
ultimately
to
a
petition.
its
sole
purpose
is
to
satisfy
the
local
district
court
rules
that
require
that
there
be
some
showing
for
the
court
to
exercise
its
discretion
in
issuing
a
stay.
this
court
recognized
that
requirement,
or
at
least
a...
the
discretionary
nature
of
the
state
grant
in
mcfarland.
this
isn't
something
that
automatically
happens.
it's
something
that
has
to
be
deserved,
and
the
way
the
local
rules
in...
in
california
work
are
that
they
have
to
file
the
statement...
a
specification
of
non-frivolous
claims.
it
doesn't
ask
for
habeas
relief.
in
this
case,
it
stated
2
out
of
ultimately
28
claims
that
were
ultimately
raised.
it...
it
doesn't...
it's
not
labeled
a
petition.
there
was
no
expectation
whatsoever
by
mr.
garceau
that
that
was
treated
as
any
sort
of
a
petition--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--exactly.
that
was
its
sole
purpose.
there's
absolutely
nothing
that
is
in...
contained
in
chapter
153
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
pre-application
proceedings.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
in
mcfarland,
this
court
was
construing
the
term
post-conviction
proceeding
and
saying...
because
848...
21
u.s.c.
848--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--that
is
actually
the...
the
companion
provision,
the
state
provision,
in
2251.
the
provision
in
21
u.s.c.
848
specifies
that
there's
an
entitlement
to
an
appointment
of
counsel
in
a
post-conviction
proceeding--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--under...
arising
under
2254
or
2255.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
it's
extremely
explicit.
and
it
also
is
consistent
with
how
we're
treating
all
other
habeas
cases.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
well,
this
court
hasn't...
that's
what
this
case--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--i...
i...
in
all...
the
only
cases
that
this
court
has
addressed
is
in
the
non-capital
context,
and
you
have...
you've
said
that
aedpa
applies
once
the
filed
petition
is...
if
the
filed
petition
occurred
prior
to
the
enactment
of
aedpa--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--once...
if
the
habeas
petition--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--the
application
for
merits
is
filed
before--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--the
enactment
of
aedpa,
yes,
there...
that
is
not
an
aedpa
case
in--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--that's
correct.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
i
do.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
respectfully,
though,
i
believe
that
that
ignores
the
express
wording
of...
of
aedpa.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
practically
also,
there
is
no...
whatever
litigation
might
occur
with
regard
to
the
state
proceedings
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
case
which
is
what
aedpa
goes
to.
so
there
can
be
no
harm.
the
fact
that
this
was
tremendously
litigated
state
proceedings
doesn't
decide
any
issues
that
ultimately
will
be
affected
by
aedpa.
so
there's
no
harm
whatsoever.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
and
in
our...
i'm
not
saying
that
that
happened
in
our
case.
i
think
that
usually
they
don't
have...
there's
virtually
no
litigation
involved.
in
this
case,
what
happened
was
that
they're
required
under
our
local
rules
to
present
the
specification
of
non-frivolous
issues.
they
have
to
at
least
put
in
one
or
two
of
the
claims
that
are
ultimately
going
to
be
raised.
they
didn't
file
anything.
what
they
filed
was
a
conclusory
statement
that
there
were
constitutional
claims
that
would
be
made.
and
we
objected
to
that
rightfully
because
they
didn't
satisfy
our
local
rules.
and
so,
it
was
that...
that
was
the
sum
total
of
our
litigation
related
to
the
state
proceedings.
it
certainly
doesn't
create...
nothing
occurred
in
this
case
that
would
affect
in
any
way--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--there
was...
there
was
a
request
for
funds
under...
there
was
a
request
for
funds
under
848.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
that's
correct.
under
848
because
of...
it's
part
of
that...
or
that
post-conviction
proceeding
that
was
construed
in
mcfarland.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
i
think--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--i
think
that
overstates
the
situation.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
we
filed
papers
that
objected
to
the
fact
that
the
stay
had
been
granted
based
on
a
failure...
failure
to
comply
with
the
local
rules.
and
we
filed
papers
that
stated
that
and
the
court
ruled
against
us
because
they
corrected
the
deficiency,
and
that's
all
that
happened.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
aedpa
does--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--that's
correct.
and
that
is
really
demonstrated...
also
another
a
twist
on
that
is
that
an
848
appointment,
by
its
very
terms...
if
you
look
at
848(q)(9),
i
believe
is
the
provision,
it
talks
about
how
a...
how
the
appointment
of
counsel
survives
the
habeas
proceeding.
it
goes
on.
the
appointment
continues
on
into
clemency
proceedings
and
competency
proceedings
and
other
things.
so
clearly
this
is
sort
of
an
independent
track.
there's
an
appointment
of
counsel.
it
includes
that
habeas
corpus
proceeding
under
chapter
153,
and
then
it
survives
and
may
go
on
into
other
areas.
it
also
would
survive
the
dismissal
of
a
petition.
we've
had
experiences
in
the
ninth
circuit
where
the
petition
that
ultimately
ends
up
being
filed
is
deficient.
it
gets
dismissed
out.
they
go
back
into
state
court
and
they've
allowed
them
to
continue
with
that
appointment
of
counsel.
and
so
it
continues
on.
it
clearly
is
a
separate
phenomenon.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
i
think
he
would
have...
if...
assuming
that
it
had
been...
asked
for
relief
and
stated
at
least
one
claim
with
a
summary
of
facts,
fact
pleading
that's
required--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--no.
in
my
experience
with
the
ninth
circuit,
they're
very
liberal
in
that
situation.
it
occurs
frequently.
especially
in
non-capital
cases
where
a...
a
petitioner
is
initially
unrepresented
and
files
a
limited
petition,
the
court's
very
liberal
about
granting
the
ability
to
amend
the
petitions
later.
they're
not
considered
successive.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
case.
the...
the
non-frivolous
issue
standard...
very
low.
they're
just
trying
to
make
sure
that
there's
some
colorable
claim,
that...
that
the
stay
is
not
being
just
granted
on
something
that
has...
that
is
just
air.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
they
want
something
there
so
that
the
court
is
reasonably
exercising
its
stay
discretion
and...
and
appointment
of
counsel
discretion.
that's
a
substantially...
that's
unaffected,
in
my
opinion...
unaffected
and
substantially
different
than
the
question
that
comes
up
once
the
merits
petition
is
on
file,
and
we're
looking
to
see
whether
or
not
this
is...
this
is...
there's
a
valid
constitutional
violation--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--a
state
could
do
that.
the...
i
don't
believe,
again,
though,
that
aedpa
has
any
application
to
that.
the
question...
all
we
would
be
looking
at
at
that
phase
is
whether
there's
enough
to
justify
the
stay.
the...
aedpa
goes
to
the
issue
of
whether
the...
you
know,
what
the
state
court
adjudication
of
the
claim
was
and
whether
it
was
a...
involved
a
reasonable
application
of
supreme
court
precedent
and
an
entirely
different
analysis.
i
don't
believe
that
there
was,
a)
any
intent
to
affect
that,
or
any
actual
effect
whatsoever
from
changing
the
deference
that's
ultimately
applied
to
a
merits
petition
to
have
any
effect
whatsoever
on
that
initial
inquiry
that
a...
that
our
courts
in
california
require
in
order
to
satisfy
the
stay
requirement,
or
the--
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
it
is
not.
ms.
janis
s.
mclean
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
there's--
