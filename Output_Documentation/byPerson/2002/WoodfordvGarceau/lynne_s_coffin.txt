mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
is
not
whether
this
harms
mr.
garceau,
but
whether
it
is
appropriate
under
this
court's
precedent
to
rule
the
way
the
state
asked
this
court
to
rule.
for
two
independent
reasons,
the
amendments
to
chapter
153
do
not
apply
to
mr.
garceau.
first,
it
simply
cannot
be,
as
the
state
suggests,
that
after
this
court
found
in
mcfarland
that
a
capital
case
is
commenced
by
the
filing
of
a
motion
for
counsel,
that
congress
then
passed
a
new
statute,
intending
it
to
be
interpreted
consistent
with
the
dissent
in
this
case.
congress
must
be
presumed
to
have
been
informed
by
this
court's
majority
ruling
in
mcfarland.
the
mcfarland
court
ruled
that...
that
congress
had
permitted
a
capital
proceeding
to
be
initiated
by
the
filing
of
a
motion
for
counsel.
that
ruling
was
only
2
years
before
congress
made
major
revisions
to
the
habeas
corpus
law
in
aedpa.
under
statutory
construction
principles,
congress
must
be
found
to
have
been
aware
of
and
followed
this
court's
precedent
set
in
mcfarland.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
no.
what
i'm...
what
i
am
saying
is
that
i
believe
that
this
court
should
look
to
what
informed
congress
when
they
wrote
aedpa.
and
i
think
once
that
is
done,
this
court
will
conclude
that
if
you
interpret
the
ruling
in
lindh,
where...
where
107(c)
applies
to
153
and
154...
where
did
congress
get
the
word
case
when
they
were
determining
who
would
be
subject
to
this
law?
and
i
agree
with
justice
ginsburg
that
when
a
case
is
begun,
you
get
a
number,
you're
put
on
a
docket.
that
is
your
case,
and
that
is
consistent
with
what
this
court
decided
in
mcfarland.
what
is
not
consistent
is
to
believe
that
congress
used
the
word
case
rather
than
petition
when
they
quite
clearly
used
petition
in
many
other
parts
of
the
statute.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
no,
no.
what
i
said
was
that
they
passed
aedpa,
and
when
they
did
that,
they
were
informed
in
how
they
wrote
that
statute
by
mcfarland.
that
was
in
'96.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
well,
in...
yes
and
no.
i
mean,
i
think
that
they...
they
had
an
opportunity
to
change
848(q)
and
looked
at
848(q)--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--when
they
wrote
aedpa,
and
they
chose
to
leave
848(q)
in
place.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
supports
one
side
or
the
other.
however,
if
one
looks
at
mcfarland...
the
majority
decision,
as
well
as
justice
o'connor's
concurrence
and
dissent...
one
sees
that
this
court
made
it
very
clear
to
congress
that
if
they
meant
something
like
petition
or
application,
which
are
pretty
much
used
synonymously,
that
they
better
put
those
words
in
because,
in
fact,
the
majority
in
this...
in...
of
this
court
refused
to
read
that
kind
of
language
into
mcfarland,
and
that's
part
of
how
mcfarland
got
decided.
so
very
shortly
thereafter,
congress
wrote
a
law
completely
revising
or,
you
know,
substantially
revising
habeas
corpus.
and
it's
simply
difficult
to
believe
that
at
that
point,
they
decided
not
to
look
at
the
majority
opinion
in
mcfarland
which
uses
the
word
case.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
well,
i...
i
think
there
are
actually
two
answers
to
that
question.
the
first
one
is
it
isn't
really
an
issue
of
whether
or
not...
in
my
opinion,
it's
not
an
issue
of
whether
or
not
some
harm
is
going
to
come
to...
to
mr.
garceau
by
interpreting
this
one
way
or
the
other.
that's
not
the
issue.
the
issue
is
what
did
congress
mean
when
they
did
this.
they
had
one
purpose,
i
agree
with
you,
which
was
to
reform
habeas
corpus
and
make
things
move
in
a...
in
a
more
orderly
fashion.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
well,
the
language
of
the
statute
says
case,
and...
and
i
think
there...
i
think--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--i
also
think
that
there
is
a...
a
reason
that
can
be
discerned
from
their
retroactivity
provisions
which
was--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--but
congress
chose
to
determine
that
not
everyone
would
be
immediately
affected...
immediately
affected
by
aedpa,
and
they--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that,
in
fact,
the...
the
cases
that
were
in
the
pipeline,
this
finite
number
of
cases,
were
exactly
the
cases...
not
the
154
cases,
but
the
153
capital
cases
that
were
in
the
pipeline
that
congress
was
aware
that
they
were
pre-petition
cases,
petition
cases,
various
kinds
of
cases.
and
if
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
it...
this
statute
would
be
interpreted
in
a
way
so
that
anyone
that
was
in
federal
court
and
that
had
vast
proceedings
take
place,
but
that
had
not
filed
a
petition
yet,
all
they
had
to
do
was
put
the
word
petition
in.
and
i
believe
that
we
are
bound
by
what
congress
did.
i
understand
that
they
want--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--well,
if...
to
give
you
a
brief
answer,
on
the
other...
on
the
other
circuits,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
none
of
them
analyzed
this
in
terms
of
congress'
intent
at
the
time
that
they
wrote
aedpa
and
how
they
were
informed
by
mcfarland.
however,
even
if
this
court
is
not
convinced
that
congress'
awareness
of
mcfarland
is
dispositive
as
to
the
meaning
of
case
pending,
garceau
had
a
case
pending
pre-aedpa
under
this
court's
definitions
of
what
constitutes
a
case.
prior
to
aedpa,
garceau
had
begun
the
process
of
challenging
a
state
conviction
and
death
sentence
in
part
by
filing
in
the
district
court
a
pleading
detailing
two
fully
exhausted
claims
of
federal
constitutional
violations.
garceau
sought
and
received
counsel
in
order
to
raise
claims
and
challenge
a
state
conviction
and
death
sentence.
he
filed
a
document
detailing
the
two
claims
i
just
mentioned
with
their
factual
and
legal
foundation
which
were
ripe
for
adjudication.
the
district
court
made
a
determination,
after
hearings,
that
these
claims
presented
viable
grounds
for
habeas
corpus
relief.
under
hohn,
we
believe
garceau
had
a
case
pending.
the
determination
in
garceau's
case
is
very
analogous
to
the
judicial
determination
in
hohn
concerning
the
coa
application.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
yes.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
well,
there's
more
deferential
standard
to
the
state...
to
the
state
court's
decision.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
oh.
if
you're
asking
whether
this
particular
thing
that
i
was
just
talking
about
would
have
made
a
difference,
no.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
right.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
right.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
i
would
concede
that,
in
fact,
in
this
case
and
i
think
all
the
pipeline
cases,
that
even
if
aedpa
had
applied
at
the
time
that
the
case
originated,
there
would
not
have
been
a
different
determination
in
terms
of
those
early
proceedings.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
however,
the...
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
now
is
that
even
if
this
court
doesn't
believe
that...
that
case
pending
can
be
determined
by
looking
at
mcfarland
and
lindh,
i
think
that
the...
what
hohn
has
identified
as
what
is
needed
for
a
case
is,
in
fact,
found
in
the
garceau
case
and
that's
because
of
the
proceeding
that
garceau
followed
where
he
actually
filed
what
could
have
been
a
petition
had
that
name
been
put
on
it.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
no.
what...
what
happened
is
there
was
an
application
for
counsel.
counsel
was
appointed.
counsel
then...
there
was
a
stay
before
counsel
was
appointed
so
that
counsel
could
be
found.
then
counsel
was
appointed,
and
an
additional
120-day
stay
went
into
effect
before
counsel
filed
the
document
i'm
now
talking
about.
and
this
document
is
the
specification
of
non-frivolous
issues,
which
includes
two
claims
that
were...
and
were
in
the
petition
ultimately
that
put...
set
forth
the
factual
and
legal
basis
for
those
two
claims.
and
then
the
judge
had
to
determine
whether
or
not
one
or
both
of
those
claims
were
non-frivolous.
otherwise,
the
stay
would
have
been
dissolved,
and
garceau...
actually
i
would
imagine
that
the
counsel
may
have
been
pulled,
but
that's
not
what
happened.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
yes.
yes,
and
as
in
hohn--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--no,
no.
this
is
before.
what
i'm...
what
i'm
saying
is
this
document,
the
specification
of
non-frivolous
issues,
which
is
required
under
the
rules
of
all
of
the
district
courts
in
california--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--no.
actually,
you
get
it
after
counsel
is
appointed.
in
order
to
get
an
additional
stay
in
which
to
file
the
petition,
you--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--you
get
counsel
and
then
counsel
must
file
something
that
a
district
court
determines
is,
in
fact...
has
at
least
one
non-frivolous
issue--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--no.
it's
served...
it's
served
on
the
other
side.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
it
wasn't
argued
in
this
particular
case
whether
they
were
non-frivolous
issues.
it's
a...
it's
a
determination
made
by
the
district
court.
however,
the
other
parties
are
served
and
certainly
could
make
an
argument--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--no.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
well,
i...
i
certainly--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--i
agree.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
well--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--well,
in
fact...
in
fact,
in
this
case
there
probably
would
have
been
a
different
determination
at
least
as
to
one
of
the
two
issues
that...
that
garceau
put
forward.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
well,
i...
i--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--no.
i...
i
don't
believe
so.
in
fact,
had
the
district
court
determined
that
there
were
no
non-frivolous
issues,
the
stay
would
have
been
dissolved,
and
unless
garceau
appealed
that
judgment
of...
of
the
district
court
or
filed
something
else,
he
would
have
been
out
of
court.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
i
don't
believe
it's
ever
happened.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
yes.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
yes.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
it
didn't
occur
in
this
case.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
there
was
a
proceeding.
before
the
statement
of
non-frivolous...
specification
of
non-frivolous
issues
was
filed,
the
state
objected
to
the
stay
that
the
district
court
had
put
into
place
to...
so
that
a
petition
could
be
filed
because
under
the
local
rules,
you
can't
get
an
additional
stay
to
file
the
petition
unless
you
file
this
document
that
shows
that
you
have
at
least
one
viable
issue.
and
so
prior
to
the
filing
of
that
specification
by
counsel,
the
state
objected
when
the
district
court
extended
the
stay.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
no.
there
was
no
response
from
the
state
at
that
point.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
i
believe...
i...
i
believe
that
they
could,
but
it
didn't
happen
in
this
case.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
that
they
couldn't...
no.
i
said...
no.
my
answer...
i'm
sorry
if
i
gave
a
confusing
answer.
my
answer
was
they
didn't
in
this
case
and
i'm
not
aware
of
it
happening
in
other
cases.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
no.
that's
correct.
that
was
my
answer.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
i
believe
that's
correct.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
well
if--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--if
the
district
court
determined
that...
if
aedpa
applied
and
the
district
court
looked
at
the
issues
that
you
wanted
to
go
forward
on,
and
applied
the
deferential
standard
of
aedpa
and,
therefore,
determined
that,
in
fact,
it
was
a
frivolous
issue
because
under
aedpa
you
would
not
be
able
to
win--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--well,
there
are--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--there
are
factual
issues
put
forth.
the
factual
and
legal
foundation
of
the
claims
that...
that
are
in
the
specification
of
non-frivolous
issues
are
put
forth.
but
i
think
that
there's
an
additional
question
that...
that
needs
to
be
examined,
which
is,
is
what
garceau
filed,
under
this
court's
precedent
in
hohn,
a
case?
and
i
believe
that
it
is.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
excuse
me?
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
apply
aedpa
to
this
case.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
no.
what...
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
aedpa
should
not
be
applied
to
garceau
either
because
of
the
first
argument
that
i
made
about
mcfarland,
or
if
this
court
is
not
satisfied
that,
in
fact,
garceau
had
a
case
pending,
which
is
the
language
from
lindh
that
determines
whether
or
not
aedpa
should
be
retroactive.
and
i'd
like
to
make
one
other
point,
which
is
that
there
are...
it
is
a
finite
number
of
cases
that
were
in
the
pipeline.
it's
a
very
unusual
situation.
in
fact,
you
had
to
be
post-state
court
determination
and
in
federal
court
and
somewhere
along
in...
in
the
process
in
federal
court
in
order
to
be
in
this
sort
of
bubble
area.
and
i
think--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--yes,
but
it
was
non-capital.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
actually
not.
what
happened
was
lead
counsel
in
state
court
was
unavailable
to
go
forward
and
neither
counsel
that...
there
were
two
counsel
that
participated
at
one
point
or
another
in
state
court,
but
neither
participated
in
the
whole
case
and
neither
was
lead
counsel.
and
so
lead
counsel
was
unavailable
and
the
court
appointed
two
new
counsel
who
had
some
familiarity
with
the
case.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
well,
there
were
a
number
of
reasons
for
that.
the
first
is
that
in
state
court,
they...
there
was
neither
discovery
nor
any
evidentiary
hearing.
there
was
no
mechanism...
there
was
very
little
money
and
there
was
no
mechanism
by
which
counsel
could
pull
together
an
entire
petition.
and
the
district
court
agreed
with
that
by
giving
counsel
funds
in
federal
court.
however,
the
district
court
set
forth
a
schedule
by
which
funds
would
be...
would
be
given,
and
those
funds...
you
did
some
investigation,
you
got...
you
satisfied
the
district
court,
you
got
more
funds.
the
last
funds
were
not...
were
not
given
to
counsel
until,
i
believe,
the
end
of
may,
which
was
only
about
4
weeks
before
the
petition
was
filed.
so
that's
one
reason.
the
other
reason
is
that
counsel
had
to
make
a
determination,
under
this
court's
precedent,
whether
or
not
it
would
be
a
mistake
not
to
file
a
full
petition,
the
best
petition
that
could
possibly
be
made
and
because
it
would
be
possible
that
it
might
not
have
been
able
to
be
amended.
and
so--
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
--well,
actually,
your
honor,
since
i
have
clients
in
many
different
positions
here,
i
actually
don't
believe
that
it
would
be
a
problem
for
other
capital
defendants,
and
i
do
believe
that
it's
the
correct
result
on
either
basis
that
i
have
put
forth
for
garceau.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
no.
ms.
lynne
s.
coffin
this
case
has
only
had
one
number
in
district
court,
and
it
is
one
of
the
kind
of
ironies
of
all
of
this.
i
would
have
thought
that
the
word
case
is
very
