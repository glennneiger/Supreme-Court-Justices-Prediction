mr.
clement,
the
government
does...
does
not
challenge
the
exemption
of
this
not-for-profit
corporation
from
expenditure
limitations?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
is
that
an
attenuated
first
amendment
right?
isn't
that
the
right
that
enables
the
formation
of
political
parties,
people
forming
together
in
order
to
collectively
give
money
to
particular
candidates?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
may
well
be,
but...
but
i...
i
wouldn't
shrug
off
as
inconsequential
the
importance
of
individuals
being
able
to
band
together
to
support
individual
candidates.
that's
the
whole
basis
for
our...
our
party
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
about
pacs.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
was
an
assumption
in
the
case.
you
don't...
you
don't...
you
don't
assert
that
it
was
a
holding
of
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
whenever
we
distinguish
a
prior
case
in
one
of
our
opinions,
that...
that
distinguishing
has
stare
decisis
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
don't
understand
that.
if...
if
i
bribe
somebody,
a
senator,
out
of...
out
of
political
motivation
because
i'm
an
environmentalist
or
whatever,
that's
not
corruption?
it's
only...
it's
only
if
i
have
some
economic
motive
that
it's
corruption?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
i...
it
may
well
be,
but
i
don't
see
that
the
distinction
between
whether
it's
an
economic
actor
or
a
political
actor
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
there's
corruption
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
you
can
have
an
immense
corporation
formed
to
advance
political
ideas.
i...
i
don't...
this
one
happens
to
be
a
small
one,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
attract
enough
people,
you
can
have
an
immense
organization.
what's
the
organization
for...
american
association
of
retired
persons.
i
mean,
that's
an
immense
organization
with...
with
a
large
amount
of
available
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
bopp,
isn't
it
also
the
case
that
the...
that
the
corporation
that
justice
breyer
posits
would
not
qualify
as...
as
a
501
exempt
organization
if
the
only
thing
it's
using
its
money
for
is
to
make
contributions
to
political
candidates?
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
has
to
be...
it
has
to
be
a
relatively
insignificant
part
of
its
overall
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
these
five
people
would
had
to...
have
to
get
together
with
maybe
100,000
other
people
so
that
their...
their
little
portion
is
so
watered
down
that
it's
not
a
significant
part
of
the
corporation's
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bopp,
that...
that
first
amendment
right
that
you
talk
about
as
the
associational
interest,
the...
the
ability
to
give
at
least
a
dollar
will
identify
you
with
a...
with
the
candidate,
is
that
really
a
first
amendment
interest
that
applies
to
the
association,
or
does
it
apply
to
the
members
of
the
association?
and
as
mr.
clement
pointed
out,
the
individual
members
of
the
association
remain
free
to
give
a
dollar,
indeed
up
to
$2,000,
to
the
particular
candidate.
all
you're
really
talking
about
here
is...
is
not
the
ability
of
individuals
to
identify
themselves
with
a
candidate,
but
the
ability
of
individuals
by
pooling
their
resources
to
help
a
candidate
significantly.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
only
interest
at...
at
issue
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
among
those
reasons
is
not
in
order
to
identify
myself
with
that
candidate.
justice
antonin
scalia
to...
to
do
that,
all
you
have
to
do
is
reach
in
your
pocket
and
give
them
a
dollar.
