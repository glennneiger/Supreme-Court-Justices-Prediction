mr.
bopp,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
really
would
go
just
the
same
way
to
an
amount
limitation
as
to
a
total
prohibition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
everybody
can
just
contribute
$10.
wouldn't
that...
would
that
be
okay
with
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
the
amount
limitation
was
very
low.
as
i
understand
it,
you're
trying
to
draw
a
categorical
distinction
between
total
prohibition
and
amount
limitation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
don't
know...
i
don't
see
that
your
argument
really
is
directed
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
an
amount
limitation
that's
very,
very
low
would
have
the
same
vice
under
your
argument
as
a
total
prohibition.
