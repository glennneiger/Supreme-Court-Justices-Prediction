mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
expressive
associations
play
a
vital
role
in
our
democratic
republic.
because
they
attract
financial
support
due
to
their
political
ideas,
not
their
prowess
in
the
economic
marketplace,
their
participation
in
our
political
process
poses
no
threat
of
corruption,
as
long
as
they
do
not
serve
as
a
conduit
for
business
corporation
contributions.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
that's
classic
quid
pro
quo
corruption
which
is
dealt
with
by
contribution
limits,
now--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
there
has
been
some
controversy
on
this
court
on...
on
whether
or
not
the...
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
mass.
citizens
and
on
austin
were
in
accordance
with
the
constitution,
but
in
both
cases
the
court
distinguished
between
the
types
of
corruption
that
are
entailed
by
the
corporate
form,
which
is
the
potential
for
unfair
employment
of
wealth
for
political
purposes.
this
applies
to
economic
corporations,
that...
that
is,
those
that
are
not,
as
mass.
citizens
or
north
carolina
right
to
life,
formed
to
advance
political
ideas.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
and--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--that's
right
and
the
size
of
the
organization
is
not
the
issue.
the
issue
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
is
whether...
is
the
nature
of
the
organization
itself
and
not
the
corporate
form
per
se.
if
the
nature
of--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
we
do--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
the...
the
court
in
mass.
citizens
established
some
criteria
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
organization,
a
corporation,
benefitted
from
the
mcfl
exemption.
and
those
include
whether
or
not
there
are
incentives
to
disassociate...
lack
of
incentives
to
disassociate
by,
for
instance,
having
insurance
plans
and
other
benefits
of
membership
that
are
economically
related.
secondly,
you
would
look
to
the
amount
of
corporate...
business
corporation
contributions
or
business
activities.
if
those
are
too
much
or
those
are
not
insignificant,
in...
in
comparison
with
the
total
sums
raised,
then
again
they
would
not
qualify.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the...
all
the
circuits
that
have
considered
this,
which
have
been
four
of
the
circuits,
all
agree
that
the
features
explained
and...
and
characterizing
mass.
citizens
in...
in
the
supreme
court's
decision
were
not
constitutional
requirements,
but
descriptions
of
the
organization
before
it.
and
all
of
them
have
agreed
that...
that
not-for-profit
ideological
corporations
can
still
qualify
for
the...
for
the
massachusetts
citizens
exemption.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i
think
they
have
a
mixture
of
political
and
nonpolitical
purposes
and
are,
therefore,
more
like
austin...
the...
the
michigan
chamber
of
commerce
and
austin
that
had
a
mixture
of
political
and
nonpolitical
purposes
and
therefore
did
not
qualify
for
the
mcfl
exemption.
and
to
complete
my
answer--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
there
were
also
incentives
that
were
economic
in
nature
that
would
cause
people
to
be
reluctant
to
disassociate
with
michigan
chamber
of
commerce
if
it...
if
it
proved
to
be
that
they
disagreed
with
their
political
ideas
or
the
advancement
of
their
political
ideas.
and
the
four
circuits
that
have
considered
the
question
of
the
amount
of
business
corporation
contributions
have
all
said
that
as
long
as
they
are
insignificant,
in
comparison
with
the
total
revenue
of
the
organization,
they
still...
they
do
not
serve
as
a
conduit
for
business
corporation
contributions
and
still
qualify
for
the
exemption.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
it
is
true
that
there
are
no
contribution
limits
to
not-for-profit
corporations.
however,
the
intent
of
a
donor
to
circumvent
those
limits
would
be...
contributing
to
a
not-for-profit
would
be
a
highly
inefficient
and
ineffective
way
of
doing
so
because
the
political
activities
of
not-for-profit
corporations,
both
because
of
the
major
purpose
test
that
would
cause
an
organization
to
become
a
pac
if
political
activity
became
their
major
purpose,
and
the
internal
revenue
service's
limitations
on
the
activities
of
501(c)(4)
organizations,
which
is
what
the
regulations
require
you
to
be
qualified
as
in...
in
order
to
quality
for
the
mcfl
exemption,
all...
all
mean
that
a
very
small
percentage
of
any
contribution
to
a
not-for-profit
corporation
could
ever
be
used
for
political
activity.
furthermore,
contributing
to
a
not-for-profit
versus
a
pac
and
a...
or
a
political
party
is
also
an
unfavorable
prospect
for
a
donor.
i
mean,
after
all,
the...
a
not-for-profit
under
the
441a
contribution
limits
is
limited
to
a
$2,000
contribution,
where
a
pac
can
give
$5,000
and
political
parties
can
give
much
more.
furthermore,
all
of
the
money
that
pacs
or
political
parties
receive
in
their
hard
money
accounts
can
be
used
for
political
activity,
whereas
i've
mentioned
for
not-for-profits
it's
really
a
very
small
percentage
in
order
to
continue
to
qualify
under
the
mcfl
exemption
and
continue
to
not
be
deemed
a
pac
for...
for
the
purposes
of
the
federal
election
campaign
act.
now,
the
disclosure
interest
that
there...
that
there
is
for
contributions
can
be
readily
and
in
a
narrowly
tailored
way
dealt
with
by
simply
requiring
that
any
contribution
to
a
not-for-profit
that
is
to
be
used
for
or
is
intended
to
be
used
for
contributions
to
candidates
must
be
reported
and
is...
and
is
thereby
subject
to
the
aggregate
contribution
limits.
this
is
a
much
more
narrowly
tailored
way
to
deal
with
disclosure
and
the
aggregate
contribution
limits
than
prohibiting
the
organization
completely
from
making
any
contribution.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
if
they're
a
pac--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
if
they're...
if
they're
a
pac,
then
they
can
give
$5,000
out
of
the...
out
of
the
$10,000
that
you
posit.
if
they're
a
not-for-profit
corporation,
the
most
they
can
give--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--i
agree.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
agreed.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
the...
the
desire
of
subjecting
the
aggregate
contribution
limit
or
a
contribution
in
excess
of
$2,000,
one
direct
and
one
through
another
source,
is
dealt
with
two
ways
and
can
be.
one
is
if
the
contribution
made
to
this
group
that
you
posit
is
earmarked,
then
that
contribution
is
considered
to
be
a
contribution
not
just
to
the
group
but
also
to
the
candidate
him
or
herself.
so
that
earmarked
contribution
is
subject
to
the
$2,000
limit,
and
the
contribution
used
for
that
would
be
in
violation
of
the
act
currently.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
that
is
current
law.
and...
and
so
that
prospect
is
prohibited
and
appropriately
so.
secondly,
as
the
federal
election
campaign
act
previously
required,
that
anyone
contributing
to
a
organization,
not
a
pac,
that
contributes
money
for
an
independent
expenditure,
that
that
contribution
must
be
reported
by
the
group
that
does
the
independent
expenditure.
congress
could
require
the
same
thing
here.
they
could
require
money
given
more
generally,
not
earmarked,
but
more
generally
for
candidates
to
be
reported
by
the...
the
group
and
thereby
subject
to
the
aggregate
contribution
limits.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
that
would
also
be
true.
they--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
the
internal
revenue
service
would
treat
the
organization
that
he
described
as
a
political
organization--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--that's
exactly--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--that
would
be
an
effect
of
what
i
said,
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
much
less
restrictive.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
because
this
court
held
in
mass.
citizens
and
austin
that
the
pac
requirements,
both
administrative,
including
record
keeping,
appointment
of
a
treasurer,
filing
regular
reports,
et
cetera,
and
the
limits
that
are
imposed
upon
pacs...
there's
a
$5,000
contribution
limit
to
pacs,
et
cetera...
all
impose
an...
a
constitutionally
burden...
a
burden
on
constitutionally
exercised
rights
that
did
not...
that
did
not
pass
constitutional
muster.
so...
so
while
it
is
true
that
you
can
do
it
under
a
pac,
that
imposes
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
the
first
amendment
activities.
and
that,
of
course,
all
goes
back
to,
you
know,
is
there
a
justification
for
this.
in
other
words,
we
have
a
prohibited
source--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
there's
a
one-page
report.
there
are
organizations
that
can
do
independent
expenditures
that
are
not
pacs.
there's
a
one...
one-page
report
to
file,
and
that...
and
that
report
would
say
how
much
is
being
spent
on
the
independent
expenditure
and
how
much
has
been
donated
to
the
organization
for
the
purpose
of
that
independent
expenditure.
similarly,
a
report
like
that
could
be
filed
for
contributions
so
that
we
could
capture
those
people
who
are
trying
to
circumvent
the
limits
to...
to
make
undisclosed
or
excessive
contributions.
we
would
capture
them
because
then
the
only
choice
left
to
the
donor
would
be
a
completely
undifferentiated,
unearmarked
contribution
that
is
going
to
be
used
by
the
organization
95,
98
percent
for
other
purposes,
for
lobbying,
for
education,
for
other
charitable
activity.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
we
are
asking
you
to
distinguish
the
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
type--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--but
there
was
no
issue
in
that
case
about
whether
or
not
the
organization
itself
should
not
be
viewed
as
a
prohibited
source
of...
of
making
independent
expenditures
or
making
contributions
in
that
case.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
but
this
court
has...
was
clear
in
mass.
citizens
that
it's
not
the
corporate
form
per
se,
but
the
potential
for
unfair
deployment
of
wealth
for
political
purposes
and
held
that
these
types
of
organizations
pose
no
threat,
no
threat
whatsoever.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
but...
but--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
we...
we
believe
that
it...
that
the
holding
of
the
court
in
mass.
citizens...
that
this
organization
serves
no
potential
for
corruption
of
the
democratic
process,
was
essential
for
the
court
to
hold
that
no
independent...
that
independent
expenditures
would
be
allowed
because,
after
all--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
but
in...
but
in
right
to
work,
it
wasn't
a
prohibition
on
contributions.
it
was
a...
a
limit
on
the
amount
of
contributions.
and
we
agree
that
limits
on
amounts--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
that's
what
you
said.
but
the...
the
case
did
not
involve...
neither
mass.
citizens
nor
right
to
work
involved
a
limit
on
the
amount
of
contributions,
that
is,
like
a
$2,000
limit.
we
have
not
challenged
that.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
only
as
to
a
prohibition
on
them.
that
is,
this
court
in
buckley
and
reaffirmed
in
shrink
said
that
there
were
both
speech
and
association
aspects
of
making
a
contribution.
that
is,
it's
a...
as
far
as
speech
is
concerned,
this
is
a
general
expression
of
support
that
is
found
in
the
undifferentiated
act
of
contributing.
well,
here
they
are
prohibited
from
contributing.
they
cannot...
these
organizations
cannot
give
one
cent.
therefore,
that's--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes,
as
to
a
prohibition.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
that's
correct
because
both
the
speech
aspects
and
association
aspects
of
contributing
that
are...
that
remain
after
limits
on
the
amounts
are
imposed
because
the
speech
aspect
is
a
general
expression
of
support
and
the
association
aspect
is
to
serve
to
affiliate
a
person
with
the
candidate.
you
have
your
name
now
through
the...
the
method
of
the
contribution
affiliated
with
the
candidate.
when
you
have
a
zero
contribution
limit,
then
there
is
no
speech
and
no
association
that
is
allowed
through
the
act
of
contributing.
therefore--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
that
is...
that
is
generally
a
correct
characterization
of
your
jurisprudence,
but
you
have
to
examine
why.
why
is
it
that
contributions
are
subject
to
a
lower
level
of
scrutiny?
and
the...
the
why
is
is
that
the
speech
and
association
aspects
of
giving
a
smaller
contribution
remain,
but
if
you
can't
give
any
contribution,
then
both
that
speech
and
association
aspect--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
not
only
is
it
cumbersome,
but
it's
constitutionally...
it's
an
unconstitutional
burden
this
court
has
held
in
mass.
citizens
and
in
austin
to
require
first
amendment
political
activity
to
be
done
through
a
pac.
so--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
and
i'm
aware
of
that,
but
i'm
just
asking
this
court
to...
to
consider
not...
not
to
apply
what
is
dicta
in
mass.
citizens
since
it
did
not
involve
contributions...
to...
to
just
apply
that,
but
to
consider
the
rationale.
and
in
north...
in...
in
national
right
to
work,
the
court
was
considering
not
a
prohibition
on
soliciting
contributions
from
members
to
its
pac,
it
was
considering
a
limit
on
what
is
considered
to
be
a
member.
so
once
again,
that
case
involved
contribution
limits,
not
prohibition.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
there's
valid
reasons
unlike
the
representation...
or
the
argument
of
the
government
for
people
to
want
to
pool
their
resources
in
an
association.
that
those
valid
reasons
are,
in
fact,
why
people
already
contribute
to
pacs
and
the
political--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
but
the--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--that
is
true,
but
many
people
choose
to
pool
their
resources
because
they
want
the
group,
which
has
a
separate
existence
and
has
a
political
purpose,
unlike
them
as
an
individual...
you
know,
they
are
not
as
identified
with
a
particular
point
of
view
or
political
idea
like
a
group
would
be,
like...
like
naral
would
be.
so
if...
so
they
choose
then
to
pool
their
resources
with
the
group
in
order
to
make
the
much
more
powerful
statement
about
the
political
ideas
that
they
are
attempting
to
support
and
they
want
candidates
to
be
associated
with.
now,
in
addition,
the
fact
that
the
group
can
aggregate
these
small
contributions
and
then
make
a
large
contribution
to
a
particular
candidate
enhances
the...
the
contribution
that
the
individual
would
otherwise
made...
be
made
because
it
is
being
done
by
the
group
and
in
an
aggregate.
so
there
are
justifiable
reasons
why
people
want
to
associate.
and
then
further,
the
association--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--no,
because
amount
limitations
do
not--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--you
mean
the...
the
amount
that--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
it
goes
to
the
source
of
the...
of
the
rights,
the
first
amendment
rights,
that
are
implicated
by
a...
by
an
amount
limitation
as
opposed
to
a
prohibition.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
potentially,
but
that
would
be
a
case
to
be
a
decided
at
that
point.
and...
now,
this
court
has
upheld
the
$5,000
limit,
for
instance,
to
political
action
committees.
and...
but
you
would
have
to
consider...
if
it
got
too
low,
i
mean,
there's
certainly
a
potential
for
contributions
that
are
too
low...
as
justices
breyer
and
ginsburg
explained
in
shrink,
there
is
certainly
a
potential
if
they're
too
low
to
be
unconstitutional.
but
here
we're
not
talking
about
and
have
not
challenged
the...
the
$2,000
limit.
we
accept
that.
we
just
don't
accept
the
proposition
that
because
the
organization
poses
no
threat
of
corruption
to
the
political
process,
that
they
should
be
completely
prohibited
from
making
a
contribution.
so...
so
we
view
this
then
as
a
source
limitation,
not
as
an
amount
limitation,
and
as
a
result,
the...
the
contribution
jurisprudence
of
this
court
that
have
accepted
greater
regulation
of
contributions
is
not
applicable.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
