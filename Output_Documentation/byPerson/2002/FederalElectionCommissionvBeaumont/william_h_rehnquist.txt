we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
02-403,
the
federal
election
commission
v.
christine
beaumont.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
after
the
decision
in
massachusetts...
the
massachusetts
case,
the
nrwc
would
have
a
right
to
make
independent
expenditures?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
summarize
briefly
what
the
enhanced
disclosure
requirements
are?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
donor
is
listed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
clement.
mr.
bopp,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
bopp,
would
you
say
that
the
aarp,
which
was
referred
to
by
justice
scalia,
the
national
right
to
work
committee,
which
was
involved
in
that
opinion,
and
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
are
all
in
the
same
boat?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
call
aarp
an
ideological
organization?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
couldn't
have
been
a
holding
in...
in
the
massachusetts
case
because
there
you
were
talking
about
independent
expenditures
rather
than
contributions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
massachusetts
case
doesn't
control
the
outcome
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
don't
think
any
of
our
cases
have
sliced
the
onion
quite
that
fine
to
get
into
these
nuances
that
there's
a
difference
between
prohibiting
a
contribution
and
limiting
it.
i
think
our
distinctions
have
been
primarily
that
contributions
may
be
quite
substantially
regulated,
independent
expenditures
cannot
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bopp.
mr.
clement,
you
have
11
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
we
actually
held,
mr.
clement,
that
in
regulating
contributions,
the
government
must
find
the
least
restrictive
means?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-403,
federal
election
commission
versus
beaumont
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
federal
election
law
prohibits
a
corporation
from
making
contributions
or
expenditures
in
connection
with
certain
federal
elections,
but
the
law
allows
a
corporation
to
solicit
donations
to
a
separate
fund
called
a
pac
that
may
make
electoral
contributions
and
expenditures.
the
respondents
who
include
a
non-profit
advocacy
corporation
known
as
north
carolina
right
to
life,
inc.
brought
a
first
amendment
challenge
to
these
restrictions
as
applied
to
the
corporation
which
i
will
call
ncrl.
it
is
relevant
to
our
case,
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
ncrl,
and
held
it
so
far
as
the
ban
on
direct
contributions
applied
to
ncrl,
it
was
unconstitutional.
a
divided
fourth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse.
the
core
ban
on
direct
electoral
contribution
by
corporations
has
been
in
effect
since
the
first
federal
campaign
finance
law
in
1907.
today,
then
the
law
focuses
on
special
characteristics
of
the
corporate
structure
that
can
threathen
the
integrity
of
the
political
process.
by
preventing
corporate
wealth
from
being
converted
into
political
war
chests,
the
ban
was
and
is
intended
to
prevent
corruption
and
the
appearance
of
corruption;
the
ban
also
protects
individuals
who
have
paid
money
into
a
corporation
from
having
their
money
used
to
support
political
candidates
to
whom
they
may
be
opposed,
and
the
ban
hedges
against
the
use
of
corporations
whose
conduits
were
circumventing
valid
contribution
limits
for
individuals.
based
with
the
historical
pedigree
of
the
ban
on
direct,
contributions,
corporate
contributions,
ncrl
limits
its
challenge
to
the
laws
and
application
to
nonprofit
advocacy
corporations.
we
all
but
rejected
this
focused
argument
in
1982,
however
in
a
case
called
fec
against
national
right
to
work
committee.
although
that
case
involved
a
specific
provision
restricting
pac
solicitation,
it
is
hard
to
read
our
opinion
there
except
on
the
practical
understanding
that
limiting
an
advocacy
corporation
to
indirect
contributions
through
a
pac
is
constitutional.
moreover,
we
specifically
rejected
the
argument
pressed
by
ncrl
here.
the
deference
to
congressional
judgments
about
corporate
contribution
restrictions
should
turn
on
details
of
corporate
form
or
on
the
affluence
of
particular
corporations.
another
significant
case
is
our
later
decision
in
fec
against
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
in
which
we
held
the
laws
ban
on
independent
expenditures
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
a
non-profit
advocacy
corporation.
in
so
doing,
we
specifically
reaffirmed
our
explanation
in
national
right
to
work
and
distinguish
the
earlier
cases
involving
regulation
of
contributions
not
expenditures.
in
short,
we
could
not
rule
in
ncrl's
favor
without
revising
or
understanding
of
the
potential
risks
of
corporate
contributions,
of
the
expressive
significance
of
contributions,
and
of
the
consequent
deference
owed
for
legislative
judgments
on
the
subject
of
contributions.
ncrl's
efforts
to
unsettle
these
points
are
without
merit.
first
non-profit
advocacy
corporations
no
less
than
the
for-profit
counterparts
benefit
from
state
created
advantages
and
maybe
able
to
a
mass
substantial
political
war
chest
as
the
examples
of
the
national
rifle
association,
the
aarp,
and
the
sierra
club
may
clear.
second,
contrary
to
ncrl's
argument,
the
level
of
scrutiny,
we
apply
a
campaign
finance
regulation,
it
turns
on
whether
a
regulation
is
a
ban
or
a
limit,
but
on
the
relationship
of
the
political
activity
it
issued
a
speech
in
associational
interest.
going
back
almost
30
years,
restrictions
on
contributions,
they
have
been
treated
as
merely
marginal
speech
restrictions
subject
to
relatively
complaisant
first
amendment
review.
applying
the
appropriate
level
of
scrutiny,
we
reaffirm
that
making
a
pac,
the
sole
avenue
for
an
advocacy
corporations
political
contributions,
is
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
scalia
joins.
