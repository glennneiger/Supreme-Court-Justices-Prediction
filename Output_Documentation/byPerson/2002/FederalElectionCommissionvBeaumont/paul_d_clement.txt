mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
campaign
finance
cases
consistently
emphasize
the
fundamental
distinction
between
contributions
and
expenditures.
direct
transfers
of
cash
to
a
candidate
pose
unique
risks
of
the
appearance
of
corruption
or
the
threat
of
actual
corruption
while,
at
the
same
time,
imposing
less
significant
interference
with
first
amendment
values.
and
so
this
court's
jurisprudence
consistently
recognizes
that
there
is
less
rigorous
scrutiny
on
limitations
on
contributions
relative
to
limitations
on
expenditures.
the
court
below
lost
sight
of
that
fundamental
dichotomy.
it
held
that
corporations
of
the
type
that
this
court
exempted
from
the
general
limitations
on
corporate
expenditures
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
were
equally
exempt
from
the
broad
prohibitions
on
corporate
contributions
to
candidates.
that
reasoning
ignores
this
court's
decision
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
itself,
which
specifically
distinguished
between
the
expenditures
and
contributions
of
nonprofit
corporations.
more
fundamentally,
the
decision
below
ignores
this
court's
decision
in
national
right
to
work
committee.
there
this
court
held
that
the
broad
limitations
on
corporate
contributions
and
the
specific
limitations
on
solicitation
embedded
in
that
broad
prohibition
were
constitutional
against
a
first
amendment
challenge.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
the
court
below
addressed
both
an
expenditure
issue
and
a
prohibition
issue
with
respect
to
contributions,
and
the
government
only
took
up
the
prohibition
on
contributions.
so
that
is
the
only
issue
before
the
court.
i
think
it's
important,
though,
to
understand
that
that
is
a
distinction
that
the
court
below
placed
insufficient
emphasis
on
because
that
is
a
distinction
between
contributions
and
expenditures
that
underlies
the
last
quarter
century
of
this
court's
campaign
finance
jurisprudence.
and
in
national
right
to
work
committee
itself,
this
court
recognized
that
the
broad
prohibitions
on
contributions
applied
to
all
corporations,
including
those
like
national
right
to
work
committee
itself
that
were
without
great
financial
resources.
nonetheless,
in
the
particular
context
of
corporate
contributions
to
candidates,
this
court
held
that
it
would
not
second
guess
congress'
decision
that
a
broad,
prophylactic
approach
was
necessary
when
corruption
was
the
evil
feared.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
it
would,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
think
that
where
i
would
point
to
first
is
your
dissent
in
that
case
because
in
that
case
in
your
dissent,
you
made
the
argument
that
national
right
to
work
committee
was
essentially
the
same
as
massachusetts
citizens
for
life.
and
the
majority,
in
responding
to
that
argument,
didn't
draw
any
particular
distinction
between
national
right
to
work
committee
and
massachusetts
citizens
for
life,
but
rather
drew
a
firm
distinction
between
the
level
of
scrutiny
that
applies
to
limitations
on
contributions
and
the
level
of
scrutiny
that
applies
to
limitations
on
expenditures.
so
i
would
read
that
decision
as
saying
that
the
critical
distinction
is
not
the
differences
among
the
types
of
corporations
with
respect
to
contribution
bans,
but
is
the
fact
that
contribution
bans
are
much
more
readily
approved
under
first
amendment
analysis
than
expenditure
bans.
and
national
right
to
work
committee
obviously
wasn't
the
last
word
on
that
subject.
this
court
reaffirmed
the
validity
of
a
broad,
prophylactic
approach
to
corporate
contributions
both
in
national
conservative
political
action
committee
and
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
itself.
particularly,
in
light
of
massachusetts
citizens
for
life,
a
ban
on
corporate
contributions
by
nonprofits
does
not
impose
significant
burdens
on
first
amendment
interests.
in
the
particular
context
of
this
type
of
corporation,
the
corporation
is
free
to
engage
in
unlimited
spending
on
elections
through
the
corporate
form,
and
the
individual
respondents
are
free
to
give
unlimited
contributions
to
north
carolina
right
to
life.
in
addition
and
equally
important,
the
individual
members
of
north
carolina
right
to
life
are
free
to
give
contributions
to
the
candidates
of
their
choice
up
to
the
constitutionally
valid
contribution
limits.
accordingly,
this
case
doesn't
involve
the
right
to
associate
together
or
the
right
to
associate
with
candidates
of
someone's
individual
choosing,
but
only
the
right
to
assemble
together
collectively
to
give
money
to
candidates
of
an
organization's
collective
choosing.
and
even
that
rather
attenuated
first
amendment
interest
is
only
affected
to
the
extent
that
a
corporation
must
direct
its
contributions
through
a
separate
segregated
fund
with
enhanced
disclosure
and
reporting
and
bookkeeping
requirements.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
certainly
in...
in
the
first
point,
parties
are
subject
to
a
different
type
of
regulation
under
the
campaign
finance
laws.
but
secondly--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and...
and
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
there's
no
first
amendment
interest
on
the
other
side
of...
of
the
argument
in
this
case,
but
what
i
did
mean
to
suggest
is
that
interest
is
less
significant
than
the
interest
in
individuals
banding
together
to
make
expenditures
that
they
might
otherwise
not
be
able
to
make.
and
i
think
even
in
the
party
context,
this
court
recognized
that
distinction
in
the
colorado
republican
cases
where
it
held
that
limitations
on
what
the...
the
party
can
spend
to
support
a
candidate
are
not
subject
to
limitation,
but
what...
but
there...
but
there
are
valid
limitations
on
what
the
party
can
contribute
to
a
candidate
of
its
choosing.
now,
in
contrast
to
the
rather
minimal
first
amendment
interests
that
are
interfered
with
by
section
441b,
it
plays
an
important
role
in
safeguarding
the
integrity
of
the
election
process.
this
court
in...
in
national
right
to
work
committee
already
has
recognized
that
corporate
contributions
pose
a
risk
of
the
reality
and
appearance
of
corruption
and
that
a
broad,
prophylactic
limitation
on
all
corporations,
including
those
without
great
financial
resources,
is
an
appropriate
response
to
that
threat.
all
corporations,
regardless
of
their
size,
also
pose
risks
of
circumvention
and
of
undermining
the
workability
of
candidate
disclosure
requirements.
as
this
court
recognized
in
cedric
kushner
promotions
against
king,
the
whole
point
of
a
corporation,
its
basic
purpose
and
fundamental
reason
for...
for
existing
is
to
create
legal
separateness
between
the
individuals
that
form
and
run
the
corporation
and
the
artificial
corporate
entity
itself.
giving
such
an
artificial
entity
the
right
to
contribute
in
its
own
name,
independent
of
the
individuals
that
underlie
the
corporation,
obviously
poses
a
distinct
risk
to
a
campaign
finance
system
that
is
based
largely
on
individual
contribution
limits.
section
441b
addresses
that
risk
by
requiring
that
those
contributions
be
made
through
a
segregated
fund
subject
to
enhanced
bookkeeping
and
disclosure
requirements.
those
bookkeeping
and
disclosure
requirements,
in
turn,
make
the
campaign
disclosure
forms
that
individual
candidates
have
to
file
work
in
a
meaningful
fashion.
if
those
candidate
disclosure
forms
simply
revealed
that
the
candidate
received
money
from
an
artificial
entity
with
either
an
ambiguous
name
or
what
this
court
in
citizens
against
rent
control
v.
berkeley
termed
a
seductive
name
that
tends
to
conceal
the
true
identity
and
true
source
of
the
funds,
then
those
campaign
finance
forms...
or
disclosure
forms
will
not
provide
meaningful
information.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
441b
makes
the
underlying
corporations
use
a
segregated
fund
that
discloses
the
individual
sources
of
the
contributions,
then
the
disclosure
forms
can
work
in
a
meaningful
fashion.
i
think
it
bears
emphasis,
as
this
court
recognized
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life,
that
the
distinction
between
contributions
and
expenditures
applies
with
full
force
in
the
context
of
nonprofit
organizations.
a
limitation
on
expenditures
can
prevent
an
organization's
members,
who
might
otherwise
not
have
the
resources
to
reach
a
certain
audience,
to
pool
their
resources
together
to
reach
that
audience.
there
is
no
comparable
function
or
benefit
from
the
pooling
of
individual
candidate
contributions.
the
individual
candidates
themselves
can
perform
that
pooling
function
by
assembling
together
candidate
contributions
of
whatever
size
in
order
to
reach
an
audience
or
to
engage
in
political
speech.
the
intermediate
pooling
function
that
the
nonprofit
corporation
serves
can
only
benefit
by
either
circumventing
the
individual
contribution
requirements
or
assembling
an
aggregate
contribution
of
a
sufficient
size
to
potentially
capture
the
attention
of
a
candidate
for
purposes
of
a
quid
pro
quo.
to
be
sure,
the
same
provisions
of
the
campaign
finance
laws
allow
corporations
to
assemble
funds
in...
in
aggregate
amounts
through
a
segregated
fund,
but
only
with
the
additional
safeguards
that
are
imposed,
including
enhanced
disclosure
requirements.
congress,
in
adopting
section
441b,
drew
an
important
distinction
between
corporations
and
their
ability
to
contribute
and
individuals.
in
the
expenditure
context,
the
limitations
on
corporate
expenditures
stand
in
stark
contrast
to
the
general
right
of
individuals
to
engage
in
unlimited
independent
expenditures.
but
no
one
has
a
right
to
engage
in
unlimited
corporate...
in
unlimited
contributions
to
candidates.
congress
addresses
the
threat
of
individual
contributions
through
dollar
amounts.
it
addresses
the
distinct
risks
of
corporate
contributions
through
the
requirement
of
a
segregated
fund,
higher
limits,
and
enhanced
disclosure
requirements.
respondents
effectively
ask
this
court
to
disregard
and
second
guess
congress'
decision
to
treat
corporations
differently
from
individuals
for
purposes
of
candidate
contributions.
with
respect,
i
think
essentially
respondents
ask
this
court
to
treat
north
carolina
right--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--certainly,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
the...
the
main
difference
is
that
in
the
context
of
a
segregated
fund,
all...
both
all
incoming
contributions
to
the
segregated
fund
and
all
disbursements
must
be
disclosed.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
pacs.
i
mean,
the
pacs
generally...
there
are
segregated
funds
in
the
particular
context
of
corporations
and
labor
unions.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
donor
is
listed.
there
are
specific
provisions
for
very
small
donations
where
the
name
only
goes
to
the
fec
and
is
not
publicly
disclosed.
but
there's
a...
but
really,
everything
that
comes
in
and
comes
out
of
the
segregated
fund
is
traceable
either
by
the
fec
or
through
the
public
in
disclosure
requirements.
in
the
context
of
the
corporation
generally,
only...
only
donations
that
are
given
over
$200
and
for
the
express
purpose
of...
of
political
activity
have
to
be
disclosed.
and
that
does
create
a
significant
loophole.
in
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
o'connor,
it
really
isn't,
at
least
as
this
case
comes
to
this
court.
the
prohibitions
on
corporate
contributions
have
been
in
the
law
since
1907
and
have
been
left
completely
unaffected
by
the
bipartisan
campaign
finance
reform
act.
it
is
true
that
certain
limitations
on
electioneering
activity,
which
is
a
new
term
introduced
into
the
law
by
the
bipartisan
campaign
finance
reform
act,
do
apply
to
corporations.
so
in
considering
challenges
to
the
mccain-feingold
legislation,
this
court
may
have
to
consider
the
restrictions
on
corporations
engaged
in
expenditures
and
these
new
electioneering
activities,
but
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
issue
of
corporate
contributions
is
miraculously
unaffected
by
the
many
reforms
that
are
put
in
place
by
the
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act.
[laughter]
in
the
end--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--a...
a
political
action
committee
or
any
segregated
fund
can
give
$5,000.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there
is
indeed,
justice
breyer.
it's
$5,000.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
two
points
of
emphasis
just
on
that
question.
one
is
that
respondents
here
don't
just
have
the
right
to
set
up
a
segregated
fund,
but
they've
actually
already
done
that.
they've
already
set
up
a
segregated
fund.
and
i
know
that
this
court
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
emphasized
that
there
are
unique
restrictions
and
burdens
on
setting
up
a
segregated
fund,
and
i
think
that's
true
in
the
context
of
expenditures.
but
i
do
think
it's
easy
to
exaggerate
the
burdens
that
are
imposed
in
setting
up
a
segregated
fund.
although
a
segregated
fund
is
like
a
pac,
there's
no
requirement
that
they
have
separate
offices
or
separate
officers.
they
have
to
have
a
distinct
leadership
and...
and...
but
it
can
be
the
same
leadership
as
the
corporation
itself.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
know
of
any
particular
limit
on...
on
the
members.
but
the
point
is
all
that's
really
required
is
segregation
of
funds
and
keeping
it
separate.
it's
not
an
onerous
requirement.
and
i
think
it's
no
accident
that
in
the
four
cases
that
this
court
has
had
that
involved
a
nonprofit
corporation,
national
right
to
work
committee,
massachusetts
citizens
for
life,
austin
against
michigan
chamber
of
commerce,
and
this
case,
all
four
of
those
nonprofits
had
already
set
up
segregated
funds
before
the
case
got
to
this
court.
so
i
don't
think,
at
least
in
the
contribution
context,
that
those
are
onerous
requirements.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there
was.
this
court
in
footnote
8
suggested
that
that
wasn't
dispositive
of
its
reasoning
because
other...
other
entities
could
set...
be
in
a
position
that
were
similar
to
massachusetts
citizens
for
life,
might
not
be
able
to
afford
those
burdens.
but
massachusetts
citizens--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
the...
that
it
may
not
be
true
that
the
risks
are
slightly
less
in
the
context
of
a
nonprofit
advocacy
corporation
than
in
the
context
of
something
like
general
motors.
but
i
think
in
the
particular
context
of
candidate
contributions
by
corporations,
this
court
has
repeatedly
decided
that
it's
willing
to
accept
a
broad,
prophylactic
approach
and
to
limit
all
corporate
contributions,
including
contributions
by
corporations
without
great
financial
resources.
the
court
said
as
much
in
national
right
to
work
committee.
it
repeated
that
again
in
national
conservative
political
action
committee,
but
i
think
most
tellingly,
it
said
that
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
itself.
and
in
particular,
if
you
look
at
footnote
13
of
the
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
decision,
the
court
there
specifically
said
that
it
understood
that
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
would
continue
to
be
subjected
to
the
national
right
to
work
committee
regime
for
purposes
of
its
contributions,
and
it
was
talking
about
the
fact
that
it
didn't
have...
that
massachusetts
citizens
for
life,
for
example,
didn't
have
shareholders.
but
it
was
quick
to...
to
reinforce
that
that
didn't
mean
that
it
didn't
have
members
for
purposes
of
national
right
to
work
committee
that
it
could
solicit,
subject
of
course
to
the
overall
limit
that
it
could
not
give
direct
contributions
to
candidates.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
the
holding
of
the
case
because,
obviously,
that
case
involved
expenditures.
but
i
do
think
that
when
this
court
distinguishes
a
prior
precedent
of
the
court,
that
that's
not
a
part
of
the
opinion
that
a
lower
court
is
free
to
ignore.
i
think
that
part
of
the
opinion
is
critical
to
the
reasoning
of
the
court
and
should
be
given
stare
decisis
effect.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
that's
been
brought
to
bear
here
to
revisit
this
court's
distinction
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
between
contributions
and
expenditures,
which
after
all,
is
the
fundamental
building
block
of
this
court's
campaign
finance
jurisprudence.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
think
that
in
many
respects
that's
the
most
important
part
of
the
opinion.
it's
not
to
say
that
the
court
can't
subsequently
revisit
that
part
of
the
opinion.
i
mean,
that's
certainly
what
this
court
can
do,
but
i
think
for
purposes
of
a
lower
court,
anyway,
if...
if
this
court
distinguishes
two
cases
on
the
ground
that
the
prior
case
involved
a
corporation
that
had
less
than
$10,000
and
a
subsequent
case
comes
along
where
there's
$9,999
involved,
i
would
think
the
lower
court
would
be
well
served
to
heed
the
distinction
that
this
court
drew.
and
i
think
in
this
particular
context,
obviously,
this
court
is
free
to
reconsider
its
prior
precedents,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
do
so.
the
distinction
between
contributions
and
expenditures
has
proved
workable
particularly
in
the
context
of
nonprofit
corporations.
as
i
say,
this
isn't
some
abstract
application
of
the
contribution/expenditure
dichotomy
that
this
court
has
never
considered.
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
involved
a
nonprofit
corporation
and
this
court
was
at
pains,
pretty
much
at
every
step
in
the
court's
reasoning,
to
distinguish
between
contributions
and
expenditures.
in
the
end,
i
think
respondents
ask
this
court
effectively
to
disregard
congress'
decision
to
treat
corporate
contributions
distinctly
from
individual
contributions.
they
effectively
ask
this
court
to
treat
north
carolina
right
to
life
incorporated
as
if
it
were
not
incorporated,
but
there's
no
reason
to
disregard
either
respondents'
decision
to
incorporate
or
congress'
decision
to
subject
all
corporations
to
the
same
regime,
segregated
funds,
distinct
disclosure
requirements,
and
higher
limits,
in
fact,
on
their
contributions.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
with
the
distinction
that
respondents
rely
on
between
limits
on
contributions
and
prohibitions
on
contributions.
even
if
there
is
something
to
that
distinction...
and
i
rather
doubt
there
is
for
some
of
the
reasons
unearthed
by
justice
stevens'
colloquy
with...
with
counsel
for
respondent.
even
if
that
were
a
valid
distinction,
this
case
does
not
involve
an
absolute
prohibition.
this
court,
both
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
and
austin,
and
in
fact,
much
earlier
in
pipefitters,
made
clear
that
the
limitations
on
corporate
and
labor
union
contributions
in
section
441b
are
not
a,
quote,
absolute
prohibition,
but
rather
just
a
limitation
on
contributions.
the
availability
of
the
segregated
funds
to
make
the
contributions
is
another
way
of
making
this
a
limitation,
a
particular
limitation
designed
for
the
unique
risks
of
artificial
entities
like
corporations
and
labor
unions.
and
i
think
any
effort
to
distinguish
the
discussion
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
and
its
distinguished...
distinctions
between
contributions
and
expenditures
on
the
grounds
that
a
prohibition
might
be
different
just
doesn't
work
because
both
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
and
national
right
to
work
committee
involved
this
very
provision,
section
441b.
so
whatever
there
might
be
in
the
case
of
an
absolute
prohibition
on
somebody's
right
to
make
contributions,
441b
either
isn't
that
or
isn't
that
in...
in
a
constitutionally
relevant
way
after
this
court's
decisions
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
and
national
right
to
work
committee.
some
discussion
was
had
about
fine
distinctions
that
potentially
could
be
drawn
between
the
american
association
of
retired
persons,
national
right
to
work
committee,
massachusetts
citizens
for
life,
and
north
carolina
citizens
right
to
life.
the
point
of
section
441b
in
the
contribution
context
is
that
congress
has
not
found
a
need
to
draw
those
kind
of
fine
distinctions.
mcfl
itself,
of
course,
drew
some
of
those
distinctions
in
the
contribution
context...
in
the
expenditure
context,
rather,
but
drew
a
distinction
between
contributions
in
light
of
the
inherently
greater
risk
of
corruption
from
contributions.
another
suggestion
was
made
that
perhaps
there
is
a
seemingly
less
restrictive
alternative.
as
with
independent
expenditures
made
by
nonprofit
associations,
perhaps
contributions
that
are
made
to
the
association
with
the
purpose
of
them
being
used
for
contributions
to
candidates
could
be
disclosed.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
and
to
the
contrary.
this
court
has
not
held
that.
it
did
not
apply
a
least
restrictive
alternative
analysis
in
national
right
to
work
committee.
in
the
california
medical
association
case,
a
plurality
of
the
court,
in
fact,
affirmatively
held
that
the
least
restrictive
alternative
was
not
required
in
the
context
of
contributions.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
that
requirement.
but
i
want
to
address
the...
the
supposed
less
restrictive
alternative
precisely
because
i
believe
that
less
restrictive
alternative
is
illusory
because
the
suggestion
is
that...
that
individuals
could
say...
could
disclose
when
they
give
a
contribution
to
a
nonprofit
organization
for
the
purpose
of
a
contribution.
well,
if
that's
going
to
have
the
effect
of
avoiding
the
circumvention
rationale,
i
wonder
whether
people
are
really
going
to
volunteer
the
information
that
the
contribution
to
the
nonprofit
is
for
that
purpose.
and
additionally,
even
if
that
is
a
permissible
way
and
would
be
enforceable
in
the
real
political
world,
that
really
doesn't
give
you
much
of
a
different
result
than
what
congress
has
specifically
provided
for
with
the
segregated
fund.
and
indeed,
the
segregated
fund
actually
is
responsive
to
the
kind
of
first
amendment
associational
interests
that
underlie
this
court's
concerns
in
buckley
and
even
going
back
to
naacp
against
button.
the
concern
is
that
disclosure
requirements
imposed
on
organizations
could
be
a
backhanded
way
to
get
at
membership
lists.
the
segregated
fund
prevents
that
by
keeping
the
membership
lists
and
the
organization
itself
separate
from
the
political
activity
of
the
organization.
indeed,
if
congress
hadn't
provided
for
segregated
funds
as
a
requirement
for
all
corporations,
but
simply
made
that
available,
i
would
think
that
many
nonprofit
corporations
would
avail
themselves
of
that
option
precisely
to
avoid
the
interference
with
associational
interests
as
in
cases
like
naacp
against
button.
the
last
point
i'd
like
to
talk
about
is
simply
this
idea
that
again
underlies
much
of
respondents'
arguments
that
because
there
is
no
threat
from
expenditures
to
these
types
of
corporations,
there
is
therefore
no
threat
to
these
type
of
corporations
engaging
in
corporate
contributions.
if
that
analysis
were
applied
across
the
board,
it
would
undermine
the
entirety
of
this
court's
campaign
finance
jurisprudence
which
is
based
on
the
fundamental
recognition
that
contributions
involve
greater
risks
than
expenditures,
and...
and
expenditures,
therefore,
are
largely
unregulated
because
they
are...
presumably
do
not
pose
as
great
a
risk
as
contributions.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
the
court
below
reversed.
