justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life,
there
was
a
separate
pac?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
court
did
say
for
that
type
of...
for
that
type
of
corporation,
not
a
commercial
corporation,
that
was
burdensome
and
unnecessary
because
the
risk
of
corruption
for
that
kind
of
corporation
was
significantly
less
than
for
commercial
corporations.
and
that
would
apply
here
as
well.
if
the...
if
the
evil
is
corruption,
i'm
buying
the
candidate
by
my
dollars,
then
that
risk
is
less
for
an
advocacy
organization.
is
that...
isn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bopp,
on
that
point
i
thought
that
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
went
further.
it
said
having
a
policy
against
accepting
corporate
contributions,
which
is
one
difference
between
your
organization
and
massachusetts
citizens
for
life.
they
said
they
would
take
no
money
from
corporations.
you
accept
money
from
corporations.
you
get
very
little
from
business
corporations,
but
you
don't
have
a
policy
of
turning
them
away.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
they
could
serve
as
a
conduit
for
a
very
large
donor,
a
very
wealthy
person,
who
wants
to
avoid
the
personal
limitations
on
how
much
that
individual
could
give.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bopp,
at
least
three
times
in
the
text
of
the
court's
opinion
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life,
at
least
three
times,
it
distinguishes
direct
contributions
to
candidates
from
expenditures,
and
each
time
it
explains
why
it
reached
the
result
it
did.
it
makes
that
distinction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
think
that...
that
that's
so
central
to
massachusetts
citizens
for
life.
so
if...
if
we
just
had
this
opinion
shorn
of
all
but
however,
remember
that
this
is
not
a
contribution
to
a
candidate
and
then
citing
back
to
the...
the
earlier
decision
that
justice
o'connor
mentioned,
the
national
right
to
work
committee,
to
distinguish
it
from
this
case,
but
it
just
seems
so
all
over
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
that
it
is
drawing
this
bright
line
between
contributions
to
candidates
and
independent
expenditures.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
i'm...
i'm
talking
about
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
and
the
line
that
justice
brennan
drew
in
the
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
between
contributions
to
candidates.
every
time
he
talks
about
the
holding
in
this
case,
he
said,
remember,
this
is
not
contributions
to
candidates.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
can
say...
you
can--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
you
say
can't
give
any,
you
are
overlooking
or
saying
the
pac
doesn't
count.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
isn't
an
absolute
no
contribution.
it
is,
if
you
do
it,
you
have
to
do
it
through
this
arm
that
you
create,
this
segregated
fund,
this
501...
of
the
501(c)(4)
organization.
you
can...
you
can
do
it
but
you
have
to
do
it
in
a
rather
cumbersome
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
isn't
you
cannot
make
any
contributions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
first
amendment
activity
in...
in
the
massachusetts
case
itself,
as
i
just
said.
i
don't
want
to
repeat
that
except
that
justice
brennan
did
repeat
it
at
least
three
times.
