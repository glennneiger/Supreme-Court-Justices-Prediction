justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the...
what
is
the
limitation
of
the
pac?
how
much
can
they
contribute,
say,
to
a
senator?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this...
this...
you're
saying
that
this
particular
kind
of
organization
can't
contribute
directly,
but
it
could
set
up
a...
what
you
call
a
segregated
fund,
which
i
was
thinking
of
as
a
pac.
and
so
if
that
segregated
fund
now
wants
to
make
a
contribution
to
senator
smith
for
his
reelection
campaign,
is
there
a
limit
as
to
how
much
they
can
give?
i'd
think
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
$5,000.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
could
they
have
two
members?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you
do
then...
this
is
what
i
understand
you
to
be
saying.
the...
one
of
their
justifications
that
has
been
advanced
for
this
restriction
on
contributions
i've
interpreted
as
the
following.
we
have
five
people.
these
five
people
each
write
a
check
to
candidate
smith
for
$2,000.
they
get
annoyed.
they
think
they
should
be
able
to
give
$4,000,
which
the
law
forbids.
so
they
form
a
committee,
a
nonprofit
corporation,
called
the
$4,000
for
smith
corporation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
each
of
them
writes
another
check
for
$2,000,
gives
it
to
the
corporation,
and
the
corporation
gives
it
to
smith.
and
i
think
the
government
says,
well,
congress
wanted
to
stop
that.
it's
not
actually
going
to
limit
them
to
zero.
they're
going
to
be
limited
to
$5,000
as
a
group
provided
they
jump
through
certain
hoops.
all
right.
now,
what's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what's
wrong
with
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
do
you
see
what
i'm
saying?
i'm
saying
congress
doesn't
want
to
have
groups
called
the
$4,000
for
smith
group
even
if
they
call
themselves
something
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
want
to
limit
each
of
those
members
to
$2,000.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
what
they
do,
though
for
a
variety
of
other
reasons,
not
directly
relevant
to
my
question,
they've
allowed
those
people
to
get
together,
jump
through
various
hoops
called
the
pac
hoops,
and
give
up
to
$5,000
extra.
so
if
congress
wanted
to,
they
might
say
none.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
that's
their...
that's
basically
the
argument,
and
i
want
to
get
a
straight,
you
know,
direct
reply
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
now...
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
trying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
think
there
was
a
numerical
limit.
and
my
question
which
tried
to
eliminate
extraneous
points
i
think
you
understood
perfectly
well
there.
i
mean
a
503(c)
corporation
but...
et
cetera.
but
i
want
to
go
back
to
your
answer.
the...
the...
because
i'm
trying
to
get
clear
about
this.
and
the...
what
you're
saying
is
that
congress
could
take
my
group,
with
whatever
else
they
have
to
do
to
qualify
them...
they
could
take
my
group
and
you're
saying
congress
could
just
say,
very
well,
we
will
limit
the
corporation
so
that
it
can
only
give
money
from
these
five
people
insofar
as
they
haven't
met
their
$2,000
individual
limit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
moreover,
it
could
require
reporting
so
we
know
who
they
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
is
that
a
less
restrictive
alternative
than
what
congress
has
actually
done,
which
is
to
say,
proceed
through
a
segregated
fund?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
