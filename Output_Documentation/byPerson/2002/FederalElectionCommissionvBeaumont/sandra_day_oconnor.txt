mr.
clement,
is
this...
is
this
section
441b
related
or
affected
in
any
way
by
the
mccain-feingold
legislation?
justice

day
o'connor
but
at
least
the
issue
here
in
this
case
is
unaffected
by
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bopp,
the
court
basically
decided
this
issue
in
national
right
to
work
committee
case,
didn't
it?
you
just
want
us
to
distinguish
your
type
of
nonprofit
corporation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
that's
very
hard
to
do.
i
mean,
we
dealt
with
this
precise
issue
in
that
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
organization
opted
for
the
corporate
form--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--knowing
about
these
limitations.
