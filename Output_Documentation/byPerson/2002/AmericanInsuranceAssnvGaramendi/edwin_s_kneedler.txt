mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
california
statute
at
issue
here
is
not
a
statute
of
general
application
that
happens
to
have
an
incidental
impact
on
foreign
nations,
foreign
countries,
or
foreign
transactions.
it
is
a
statute
that
is
written
exclusively
and
specifically
with
respect
to
a
category
of
foreign
insurance
transactions
occurring
in
foreign
countries
between
foreign
companies
and
foreign
nationals
more
than
50
years
ago,
and
it
concerns
a
subject
matter,
the
settlement
of
claims
arising
out
of
international
conflict,
that
has...
has
always
been
understood
by
this
court
to
be
the
responsibility
of
the
national
government,
as
reflected
most
recently
in
dames
&
moore.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
disclosure
is
a
form
of
regulation.
this
is
true,
this
is
obvious
from
our
securities
laws,
it
is...
it
is
evident
from
this
court's
decision
in
the
bmw
case
of
several
years
back,
where
the
court...
which
had
to
do
with
disclosure,
and
the
court
said
that
one
state
may
not
try
to
enforce
its
policies
with
respect
to
the
disclosure
of
information
in
other
states,
and
we
think
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--under
blue
sky
laws,
under
the,
i
believe
it's
the
hall
decision,
the
court
said
that
a
state
could
require
disclosures...
with
respect
to
in-state
transactions
it
could
require
disclosures
about
issuance
of
securities
out
of
state
that
are
related
to
in-state
transactions.
we
have
no
in-state
transaction
here.
california
has
claimed
two
possible
connections
to
the
state
to
justify
this
statute.
the
first
is
that
the
companies,
the
insurance
companies,
certain
insurance
companies
do
business
in
california.
those
are
not
the
ones
that
issued
these
policies,
but
they
do
business
in
california.
under
this
court's
decisions,
i
think
most
notably
the
connecticut
general
case
that
is
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
is
a
case
where
the
court
said
the
fact
that
insurance
companies
do
business
in
the
state
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
a
state
in
that
case
to
tax
transactions,
insurance
policies
that
are
entered
into
outside
of
that
state,
so
it's
clear
that
the
fact
that
certain
insurance
companies
do
business
in
the
state
does
not
give
california
a
right
to
regulate
through
disclosure
transactions
and
policies
that
happened
outside
the
state
and,
a
fortiori,
that's
true
with
respect
to
foreign
transactions.
the
other
interest
that
california
has
been...
has
asserted,
which
i
think
justice
stevens
referred
to,
is
the
fact
that
some
number,
a
very
small
percentage
of
holocaust
survivors
are
in
california,
and
with
respect
to
that,
this
court's
decision
in
shutts
make,
and
other
decisions
make
clear
that
moving
to
the
forum
state
an
adjudicatory
jurisdiction
is
not
a
sufficient
nexus,
or...
or
legislative
jurisdiction
is
not
a
sufficient
nexus
for
a
state.
what
we
have
here,
again,
is
one
state
of
the
union
trying
to
establish
its
own
foreign
policy,
in
the
words
of
the
zschernig
suit--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
this,
in
our
view,
is...
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
we
think
that
the...
that
the
longstanding
efforts
by
the
national
government
to
work
out
cooperative
agreements
with
germany
and...
and
other
countries
in
europe
arising
out
of
the
holocaust
underscores
vividly
why
this
is
a
matter
of
national
concern,
but
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument
irrespective
of
that.
the...
the
structure
of
our
constitution
assigns
to
the
national
government
the
resolution
of
foreign
policy
issues,
and
this
is
a...
this
is
a
very
major
and
longstanding
foreign
policy
issue
about
how
foreign
countries
should
resolve
claims
about
their
own
nationals.
these
policies
were
issued
to
european
nationals.
it
may
be
that
there
are
beneficiaries
or
policyholders
in
california
now,
but
this
is...
this
is
exclusively
a
matter
for
the
national
government--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not,
not
directly,
but...
but
we
do
think
that
the
executive
agreement
manifests
the
executive
branch's
policy
with
respect
to
the
resolution
of
holocaust
era
claims,
and
there
are,
i
think,
two
principal
conflicts
with
respect
to
the
united
states
policy.
one
is
the
one,
and
i
want
to
underscore
this,
the
one
that
was
mentioned
with
respect
to
the...
to
the
lists.
icheic
is
establishing
essentially
a
registry,
the
very
thing
that
california
wants
to
do,
but
in
a
much
narrower
sense
that
has
been
negotiated
specifically
to
avoid
conflict
between
german
privacy
laws
and...
and
united
states
law,
and
what...
what...
through
this
matching
exercise
and
through
use
of
various
lists
of...
of
holocaust
survivor
organizations,
jewish
organizations,
and
census
lists
in
germany
will
be
putting
together
a
pretty
comprehensive
list
of
holocaust
survivors
and
insurance
policies
issued
in
germany
to
disclose
in
a
way
that
german
authorities
believe
that
list
will
not
violate
german
privacy
laws.
the
california
statute,
germany
takes
the
firm
position
would
violate
german...
german
privacy
laws.
the
other
conflict
is
the
whole
thrust
of
the
united
states
policy
has
been
voluntary
and
cooperative,
not
mandatory
and
regulatory.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
the
best
efforts
was,
it
will
use
its
best
efforts
with
state
and
local
governments,
in
other
words
in
direct
communications,
and...
and
assistant
secretary...
secretary
eizenstat
and
others
communicated--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
this...
this
agreement
says
that...
says
two
things,
that
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
the...
this
is
on
page
155a
of
the...
of
the
petition
appendix,
that
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
the
two
countries
for
the
foundation
to
be
the
exclusive
remedy
for
the
forum
of
the
resolution
of
claims,
and
on
page
156a
the
agreement
provides
for
the
resolution
of
claims
through
icheic
and
supplemental
procedures
to
be
developed
through
icheic,
which
includes
the
development
of
this...
of
this
list.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
those...
that
did
not
involve
state
regulation,
that
involved
private
lawsuits,
and
there
was
a
settlement
which
the
united
states
encouraged.
again,
this
was
part
of
the
overall
approach
of
the
united
states
government.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
and
if...
if--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
and
if...
if
there
are
sufficient
adjudicatory
connections
to
the
united
states,
that
would
be
fine.
i
wanted
to
mention--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
the,
if
the...
if
the
defendant
was
doing
business
in
the
united
states,
if
a...
if
a
suitable
class
action--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
wasn't...
it
wasn't
entirely,
but
there
was
a
settlement
there.
some
of
these
issues
were
not
definitively
resolved.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
so
specifically,
but
that
was
early
in
the...
in
the...
in
this
settlement
effort.
i
want
to
make
two
important
points
about
the
united
states,
the...
the
constitution's
assignment
of
responsibility.
the
constitution
assigns
responsibility
to
the
national
government
for
foreign
relations
and
foreign
commerce
because
any
retaliation
or
any
adverse
impact
will
be
felt
by
the
nation
as
a
whole,
not
by
the
state
that...
that
triggers
it,
and
this
is
a
point
that
the
court
has
made
in
japan
lines
and
numerous
cases
over
the
years,
and
this
case
illustrates
that,
because
what
is
going
on
here
is
complicating.
it
is
an
impediment
with
our
relations
with
european
countries
at
a
very
sensitive
time,
when
you
have
one
state
who...
that
is
not
participating
in
all
of
those
efforts
and
doesn't
have
to
balance
the...
the
insult
that
might
arise
from
a
statute
like
this
against
all
of
the
other
issues
that
are
on
the
united
states'
plate
in
dealing
with
foreign
governments
at
a
particular
time.
this
is
the
very
reason,
that
the
states
don't
have
enough
information
and
the
full
responsibility
and
the
national
government
has
to
look
out
for
the
interests
of
the
nation
as
a
whole,
why
one
state
may
not
thrust
itself
into
foreign
policy
like
this.
the
due
process
and
foreign
commerce
arguments
are
very
complementary
of
that
because
they
impose
independent
limitations
on
a
state
thrusting
its
regulatory
power
outside
of
not
only
its
own
borders
but
in
this
case
outside
the
nation's
borders
to,
again,
regulate
through
disclosure
information
about
insurance
policies
in
other
countries.
the
very
fact
that
germany
and
california
insurance
regulations
generally
maintain
privacy
of
insurance
information
shows
that
questions
of
privacy
and
disclosure
are
matters
of
regulation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
may
i...
may
i
answer?
yes,
that
would
present
a
different
question.
we
don't
think
that
california
could
require
this
blanket
disclosure.
i
think
under
international
comity
analysis,
under
this
court's
decision
in
aerospaciale,
there
may
be
some
ability
for
the
state
to
request
certain
relevant
information--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--to
investigate
the
suitability.
