justice
david
h.
souter
--i...
i
don't
understand.
why
would
that
be?
why
is
there
a
risk?
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
this
in
the
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
kneedler,
would
your
argument
be
different
if
california,
instead
of
providing
this
registry
in
public
disclosure
said,
we
want
this
information
in
order
to
decide
whether
we
will
allow
these
companies
to
do
business
in
california?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are...
are
you
saying
that
there
is
no
way
that
the
united
states
could
act
that
would,
in
fact,
have
that
effect?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
if...
if
congress
passed
a
statute
in
effect
condemning
what
california
had
done,
not
repealing
mccarran-ferguson
but
simply
condemning
it,
or...
or
authorizing
the
president
specifically
to
make
what
the...
the
agreements
that
the
president
has
made
on
an
executive
basis
now,
are
you
saying
that
neither
of
those
acts
in
effect
would
preclude
california
from
doing
what
it
is
doing
under
this
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is...
is
your
argument...
and
i...
i
will
be
quiet
after
this
question
and
let
you
say
whatever
you
wanted,
but
what
i
want
you
to
focus
on
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
you
take
the
position
that
whenever
the
executive,
let's
say,
agreement
by
executive...
action
by
executive
agreement
is,
in
the
opinion
of
a
state
regulator,
inadequate
to
address
the
regulatory
problem
as
the
regulator
sees
it,
that
the
regulator
is
free,
in
effect,
to
disregard
the
policy
in
the
executive
agreement?
do
you
take
that
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
we
talking
about
form
of
words?
if
the
president
and
executive
agreements
had
in
effect
said,
and
no
state
can
do
anything
which
is
inconsistent
with
this
policy,
would
your
position
be
different?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
would
it
be
any
more
specific
than
this
is?
if
the
executive
agreement
is
not
expressly
preemptive,
and
congress
passes
a
statute
saying,
we
agree
with
it;
we
think
the
executive
agreement
is
right
on
the
money,
it
wouldn't,
in
fact,
be
any
more
restrictive
or
less
restrictive
than
it
is
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
1998,
the
state
of
california
passed
the
holocaust
victim
insurance
relief
act
which
requires
any
insurance
company
operating
in
california
to
disclose
certain
information
about
policies
at
or
any
affiliated
companies
sold
in
europe
between
1920
and
1945
or
else
lose
its
license
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
california.
the
law's
objective
is
to
help
holocaust
victims
find
out
about
policies
issued
by
european
insurers,
who
has
not
paid
the
value
or
benefits
of
the
policies
to
their
true
owners
or
beneficiaries
for
reason
related
to
the
criminality
of
the
german
nazi
regime
and
the
disruption
of
the
world
war
ii.
in
1999,
the
petitioners,
a
group
of
european
and
american
insurance
companies
filed
suit
challenging
the
law's
constitutionality
on
the
ground
that
it
is
preempted
by
the
national
government's
diplomatic
position
on
the
specific
matter
of
unpaid
claims
under
the
european
insurance
policies
in
issue.
the
ninth
circuit
held
the
law
valid
and
we
now
reverse.
the
problem
with
insurance
debt
by
european
corporations
during
world
war
ii
has
been
an
object
of
american
diplomacy
for
over
half
a
century.
the
trigging
in
effect
during
the
cold
war
put
a
moratorium
on
holocaust
claims
by
foreign
nationals,
but
when
that
moratorium
was
lifted
in
1990,
class
action
suits
against
european
companies
poured
into
american
courts.
those
suits
brought
protest
by
the
defendant
companies
leading
the
president
to
enter
into
any
negotiations
with
allied
european
nations
to
establish
a
mechanism
for
resolving
insurance
claims
related
to
the
holocaust.
the
executive
branch
position
in
these
negotiations
was
to
encourage
european
governments
and
companies
to
volunteer
both
information
about
unpaid
policies
and
funds
to
settle
claims
brought
under
them.
the
principle
exemplars
of
the
american
position
in
our
executive
agreement
signed
by
president
clinton
with
germany
and
austria
which
declares
that
all
insurance
claim
should
be
processed
through
a
voluntarily
settlement
organization
known
as
the
international
commission
on
holocaust
era
insurance
claims.
this
american
position
has
consistently
been
maintained
with
respect
to
all
european
insurers.
the
petitioner’s
argument
for
preemption
is
that
the
california
law
interferes
with
the
president's
foreign
policy
as
expressed
in
the
formal
executive
agreement
and
statements
originating
in
the
state
department.
the
claim
rests
on
two
premises,
each
of
which
is
supported
by
our
cases:
the
first
is
that
the
president
has
some
independent
constitutional
authority
to
determine
what
the
nation’s
foreign
policy
should
be,
the
principle
established
in
our
president’s
recognizing
that
the
president
plays
the
lead
role
in
representing
the
united
states
on
international
issues;
the
second
premise
is
that
state
law
must
yield
to
the
president’s
foreign
policy
if
the
two
are
in
serious
conflict.
the
principal
authority
for
that
preposition
is
our
decision
in
zschernig
v.
miller
in
1968.
in
that
case
we
found
and
oregon
probate
statute
touching
on
foreign
affairs
to
be
preempted
on
the
theory
that
the
field
of
the
foreign
affairs
is
an
exclusively
federal
domain
even
in
the
absence
of
any
express
federal
policy
in
the
area
of
the
state
law
and
even
though
the
state
department
itself
brought
there
that
there
was
no
objectionable
conflict
of
state
law
in
national
position.
justice
harlan
disagreed
with
the
majority's
field
preemption
theory,
but
all
members
of
the
court
agreed
that
preemption
is
required
if
state
law
conflicts
with
an
expressed
foreign
policy
of
the
national
government.
here,
the
evidence
leaves
no
doubt
about
the
conflict.
in
contrast
to
the
president’s
endorsement
of
the
international
commission's
voluntary
approach
to
disclosure
of
insurance
information,
california’s
economic
compulsion
to
make
disclosure
a
far
more
information
than
the
international
commission
requires
undermines
the
president’s
discretion
in
dealing
with
european
allies
and
the
choice
he
has
made
in
exercising
it.
the
california
law
also
threatens
to
frustrate
the
president’s
objectives
in
making
it
more
difficult
to
persuade
foreign
companies
to
participate
in
voluntary
organizations
like
the
international
commission.
indeed,
shortly
after
the
california
law
was
passed,
the
officials
of
the
executive
branch
wrote
to
california
officials
saying
that
the
state
law
threatened
the
success
of
the
president’s
diplomatic
initiatives.
the
evidence
presented
is
enough
to
make
clear
that
the
california
law
interferes
with
the
president’s
articulated
foreign
policy
with
the
consequence
that
it
is
preempted.
justice
ginsburg
will
announce
the
dissenting
opinion.
