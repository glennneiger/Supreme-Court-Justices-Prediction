mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
58
years
ago
almost
to
the
day
the
united
states
and
its
allies
defeated
nazi
germany
and
world
war
ii
came
to
an
end
in
europe.
ever
since
that
time,
the
united
states
government
has
been
actively
engaged
in
a
series
of
initiatives
to
obtain
just
compensation
for
victims
of
the
war.
these
efforts
continue
to
the
present
day.
beginning
in
the
mid-1990s,
the
federal
government
has
been
engaged
in
extensive
negotiations
with
other
governments
concerning
claims
of
holocaust
victims.
the
president
himself
has
stated
repeatedly
that
it's
in
the
foreign
policy
interests
of
the
united
states
to
have
these
claims
resolved
exclusively
in
an
international
forum
and
through
nonadversarial
means,
rather
than
through
costly,
time-consuming
and
contentious
litigation.
to
achieve
these
goals
in
the
context
of
unpaid
insurance
claims,
the
president
has
taken
three
actions.
first,
the
united
states
has
facilitated
and
encouraged
the
establishment
of
the
international
commission
on
holocaust
era
insurance
claims,
or
icheic.
second,
the
united
states,
with
the
personal
intervention
of
the
president
himself,
has
negotiated
agreements
with
germany
and
austria
under
which
those
countries
and
their
insurance
companies
agreed
to
provide
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
compensation
for
unpaid
insurance
claims
and
to
follow
procedures
worked
out
with
icheic
to
process
insurance
claims
in
a
nonadversarial
manner
and
under
relaxed
standards
of
proof,
and--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the
statute
that
congress
passed
was
the
holocaust
assets--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--commission
act,
which
clearly
gave
authority
to
the
president
to
take
control
of
this
issue,
and
didn't
provide
any
role
for
the
states
whatsoever.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs,
under
this
court's
decision
in
zschernig,
and
in
the
area
of
foreign
commerce
under
many
of
this
court's
decisions--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--our
whole
case
does
not
depend
on
zschernig--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
don't--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
to
begin
with
i
think
barclay's
is
completely
distinguishable,
justice
o'connor,
on
at
least
three
grounds.
first,
barclay's
concerns
solely
the
foreign
commerce
clause,
and
the
court
said
in
barclay's
that
congress
has
primacy
under
the
foreign
commerce
clause,
and
it
read
the
record
in
that
case
to
conclude
that
congress
had
acquiesced
in
or
approved
what
california
was
trying
to
do
in
the
area
of
taxation,
so
there
was
no
suggestion
that
what
california
was
trying
to
do
in
that
case
prevented
the
federal
government
from
speaking
with
one
voice
in
the
area
of
foreign
commerce.
there's
nothing,
to
begin
with,
comparable
in
this
case
to
suggest
that
congress
has
done
anything
to
authorize
california
to
engage
in
regulation
of
foreign
insurance
policies
involving
foreign
companies
and
foreign
beneficiaries.
secondly--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
several
things,
justice
ginsburg,
and
then
i
want
to
get
back
to
answer
justice
o'connor's
question.
first,
the
holocaust
act,
the
federal
holocaust
act
was
passed
before
the
hvira,
so
it
could
not
in
any
way
be
read
as
acquiescing
in
or
approving
anything
that
california
was
doing
in
this
area.
secondly,
and
mr.
kneedler
will,
i
think,
speak
to
this,
the
executive
agreement
did
not
expressly
preempt
any
claims,
because
these
were
claims
largely
by
foreign
nationals
against
foreign
companies,
and
the
president
did
not
believe
it
would
be
appropriate
to
extinguish
all
of
those
claims,
but
we're
not
dealing
in
this
case
with
claims
by
individuals.
we're
dealing
with
actions
by
a
state
which
interfere
with
what
the
president
himself
has
said
are
his
goals
in
an
area,
a
very
sensitive
area
of
foreign
affairs.
and
this
case
is
not
like...
this
case
is
much
stronger
than
zschernig,
because
in
zschernig,
the
federal
government
had
done
nothing
in
the
area.
nonetheless,
this
court
said
that
the
states
cannot
enter
into
an
area
where
it
has
the
potential
for
embarrassment,
or
to
interfere
with
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--so
does
this
statute.
this
statute
criticizes--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but
this
case,
chief
justice,
is
much
stronger
than
zschernig
because
this
is
not
a
case,
unlike
zschernig,
where
the
president
has
done
nothing
in
the
area.
here,
the
president
has
aggressively
entered
the
area
and
tried
to
impose
a
solution
which
he
has
concluded
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states,
so
it's
not
a
question
of
field
preemption.
zschernig
could
be
looked
at
as
a
case
of
field
preemption.
what
the
court
essentially
said,
i
think,
in
zschernig
is
that
there
is
a
field
of
foreign
affairs
where,
even
if
the
united
states
government
has
done
nothing,
the
states
cannot
enter.
this
is
a
case
that
i
think
gets
much
more
clearly
analogous
to
conflict
preemption.
here,
the
president,
with
the
acquiescence
of
congress,
has
aggressively
moved
to
try
to
solve
a
very
serious
international
problem,
and--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
don't
think
it
specifically
says
there's
to
be
no
preemption.
we're
not
dealing
here,
to
begin
with,
justice
ginsburg,
with
claims
by
individuals.
we're
dealing
here
with
state
legislation,
and
in
the
executive
agreement
the
president...
the
president
promised
to
use
his
best
efforts
to
prevent
the
states
from
interfering
with
the
executive
agreement.
he
has
concluded
on
many
occasions
that
what
california
has
tried
to
do
here
is
a
direct
interference,
a
direct
interference
with
the
foreign
policy
position
of
the
united
states,
which
is
to
funnel
all
of
these
claims
through
an
international
commission.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
i
think,
justice--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
what
the
agree...
just...
mr.
kneedler
is
probably
better
equipped
to
address
the
meaning
of
the
executive
agreement,
but
it
seems
to
me
what...
what
the
president
has
chosen
to
do
there
is
to
promise
to
use
his
best
efforts
to
look
to
see
whether
any
states
or
localities
are
taking
actions
which
interfere
with
the
promises
that
the
president
has
made
to
foreign
countries
and
foreign
insurance
companies
to
try
to
achieve
legal
peace
in
the
united
states,
and
in
those
instances
where
the
states
have
taken
action
which
interferes
directly
with
that...
with
that
promise,
the
president
has
promised
to
use
his
best
efforts,
such
as
to
file
briefs
in
this
court
and
others,
arguing
that
these...
these
state
statutes
are
preemptive,
so
it's...
there's
no...
i
think
in
the
lingo
of
a
statute
there
is
no
express
preemption
here,
but
there's
clearly
implied
preemption
under
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the...
the
international
commission
not
only
set
up
a
claims
resolution
process,
it
also
has
procedures
for
the
disclosure
of
information
which
take
into
account
european
privacy
laws,
justice
stevens.
it
was
a
very--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the
executive
agreement
chose
the...
the
president
chose
through
the
executive
agreement
and
through
his
negotiations
with
foreign
countries
to
use
the
icheic
system,
rather
than
any
parallel
system,
in
part
because
of
the
concern
about
violating
european
privacy
laws.
the
california
statute
would
be
a
blatant
violation
of
european--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but
the
international
commission
has
a
separate...
separate
policy
for
divulging
information
that...
and
right
now
the,
it's
in
the
process
of
finalizing
that.
under
the
international
commission,
all
of
the
insurance
companies
are
producing
their
data
bases
in
private--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
that's...
that's--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--false,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
based
on
outdated
information.
in
light
of
the
agreements
that
the
united
states
has
reached
with
germany
and
austria,
all
the
insurance
companies
in
those
countries
have
agreed
to
follow
the
icheic
procedures
so
that
with
the
inclusion
of
all
the
german
insurance
companies,
all
the
austrian
insurance
companies,
all
the
dutch
insurance
companies,
and
many
of
the
swiss
insurance
companies,
i
would
say
that
the
icheic
system
now
covers
at
least
double
the
percentage
that
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
interferes
in
a
number
of
different
ways,
justice
kennedy.
it
interferes,
to
begin
with,
because
it
presents
the
possibility
that
these
companies
will
have
to
pay
twice,
and
it
was
a
specific
promise
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
that
they
would
not
have
to
pay
twice.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
assuming,
that's...
this
is
all
a
part
of
the
california
system.
the
only
purpose--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
that's...
i
want
to
get
to
that
as
the
second
reason,
but
i
want
to
make
sure
the
court
appreciates
the
first
reason.
it
was
very
important
that
these
companies
not
be
made
to
pay
twice,
and
the
president--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
would
be
because
under
the
international
commission
these
companies
have
already
made
a
substantial
payment,
over
$100
million,
to
settle
their
claims,
but
if
the
california
process
is
allowed
to
continue,
it's
possible
that
people
will
be
able
to
bring
suit
in
california
and
recover
separate--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it's--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
under--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but
the
only
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
this
is
as
clear
as
can
be
from
the
face
of
the
statute,
is
to
provide
information
so
that
californians
can
bring
suit
in
california,
but
the
second
way
in
which
the
california
statute,
justice
kennedy,
interferes
with
the
icheic
process
is
that
all
of
these
companies
agreed
to
the
icheic
process
on
the
assumption
that
european
privacy
laws
would
be
respected.
that's...
that
is
one
of
the
principal
reasons
why
the
united
states
has
negotiated
this
alternative
system.
under
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but
justice
ginsburg,
this
is
very
important.
under...
we're
dealing
with
tens
of
millions
of
insurance
policies
here.
only
a
small
percentage
of
those
policies
has
to
do,
have
to...
relate
to
holocaust
victims.
california
would
require,
and
this
is
a
critical
point
for
the
court,
california
would
require
disclosure
of
the
intimate
details
of
all
10
million
of
those
policies,
99.9
percent
of
which
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
california,
and
nothing
to
do
with
any
victims
of
the
holocaust.
under
the
icheic
system,
under
the
icheic
system,
the
only
policies
that
will
be
publicly
disclosed
on
a
data
base
are
policies
held
by...
by
possible
victims
of
the
holocaust.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it...
it
know...
under
i...
under
the
icheic
system,
all
of
the
policies
written
during
this
era
that
are
on
electric
data
base
are
to
be...
are
to
be
put
into
a
system,
and
independently
icheic
has
done
a
census
of
all
of
the
possible
holocaust
victims
in
germany
during
the
pre-war
period
through
various
records
and
come
up
with
several
hundred
thousand
names
which
will
be
matched
against
the
list
of
policyholders,
and
when
there
is
a
match,
that
list
will
be
put
out
on
a
public
data
base.
the
german--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
german--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that
will...
i'm
told
that
list
will
be
out
by
the
end
of
this
month,
and
the
german
insurance
authorities
have
concluded
that
publication
of
that
list
would
not
violate
any
privacy
laws
because
it
would
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
who
are
trying
to
recover
on
these
unpaid
holocaust
era
insurance
policies.
california,
by
contrast--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--absolutely.
absolutely.
what
california
has
tried
to
do
here
would
violate
the
foreign
affairs
power
as
well
as
the
commerce
clause,
even
absent
the...
the
personal
intervention
of
the
president
himself
to
seek
an
alternative
solution
to
this
vexing
international
problem,
that's
right.
for
california,
which
has
absolutely
no
relationship
to
any
of
these
policies,
to
insist
that
they
all
be
made
public
is,
we
think,
a
clear
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it's
simply
that
california
has
no
relationship
to
any
of
these
policies.
these
policies
were
all
policies
written
in
europe
by
european
companies,
and
california's--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
is
a
separate
argument
from
the...
i
think
the...
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
we
made
three
arguments--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
i...
that's
not
true,
i
was...
i
was
trying
to
distinguish
the
barclay's
case...
the
barclay's
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
addition--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--there
are...
there
are
three
arguments
that
we
have
made
to
attack
this
california
statute.
one
is,
is
that
it
is,
under
many
decisions
of
this
court,
including
the
recent
decision
in
crosby,
in
clear
conflict
with
united
states
foreign
policy.
the
president
has
set
out
a
particular
policy
to
try
to
resolve
the
last
remaining
issue
from
world
war
ii.
it
involves
channeling
all
of
these
foreign
claims
into
an
international
commission
in
a
way
that
respects
european
privacy
laws.
california
has
set
up
a--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
would
submit,
united
states
versus
pink,
united
states
versus
belmont
are
two
cases
in
which
the
president
issued
executive
agreements
and
the
court
found
that
they
preempted
state
law.
i
would--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--those
case...
those
executive
agreements,
i
do
not
believe,
had
any
express
preemption
provisions
in
them.
the
court
simply
concluded--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--under
the
supremacy--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
it's
the
operation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
here,
the
president
has
set
out
a
policy
for
the
united
states,
and
has
issued
an
executive
agreement
with
foreign
countries
to
try
to
implement
that
policy,
and
i
think
it
is
clear
under
the
supremacy
clause
that
the
states
cannot
do
anything
that
would
frustrate
or
interfere
with
the
operation--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--and
at
the
time
that
the...
that
these
laws
were
in
the
process
of
being
passed,
the
president's
personal
representative,
stuart
eizenstat,
wrote
a
letter
to
the
governor
of
california
saying,
please
do
not
pass
this
law
because
it
will
interfere
with
what
the
united
states
is
trying
to
do
in
the
area
of
foreign
policy,
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
shame
if
this
law
went
into
effect
because
of
the
disastrous
impact
it
would
have
on
the
icheic
system,
which
the
president
of
the
united
states...
which
two
successive
presidents
of
the
united
states
have
concluded
is
in
the
best
foreign
policy
interests
of
the
united
states,
and
the
best
interest
of
holocaust
victims
in
order
to
get
money
into
their
hands
quickly.
but
secondly,
justice
o'connor,
in
addition
to
the
foreign
affairs
power,
we
think
this
is
a
blatant
violation
of
the...
of
the
foreign
commerce
clause,
which
once
again
is
not
within
the
power
of
the
states
to
interfere
with.
here
we
have
foreign
insurance
policies
that
have
absolutely
no
nexus
to
the
state
of
california.
they
are
regulated
by
foreign--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
but
this...
first
of
all,
this
court
has
held
that
the
fact
that
someone--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--you're
right
on
that
assumption,
but
to
begin
with,
justice
stevens,
we're
talking
about
10
million
policies
that
you're
trying
to
regulate,
and
at
the
maximum
they
say
they
may--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
there,
that
under
this
court's
decisions
that
the
fact
that
there
may
be
a
few
thousand
people
in
the
state
gives--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--because
icheic
has
set
up
an
alternative
disclosure
system
and
the...
which
respects
european
privacy
laws
and
secondly
because
the...
the
state
of
california
simply
has
no
power
to
exert
its
influence,
even
in
the
form
of
a
disclosure
obligation,
on
contracts
that
have
no...
absolutely
no
nexus
to
the
state.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
most
of
the
information
in
the
record,
justice
ginsburg,
and
the
information
that
the
state
relies
on
relates
to
several
years
ago,
not
to
the
current
icheic
process
before
the
german
foundation
and
the
austrian
foundation
and
a
number
of
the
dutch
companies
had
decided
to
participate
fully
in
that
process.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
these
are
all
events
that...
they're
in
the
public
record.
they're
not
in
the
record
of
this
case,
justice
souter,
but
there
are
public
documents
from
icheic
and
from
the
president
describing
all
of
this.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance--
