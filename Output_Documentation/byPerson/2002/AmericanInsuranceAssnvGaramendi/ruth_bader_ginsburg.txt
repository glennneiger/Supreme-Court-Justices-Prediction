justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
united
states
must
have
been
aware
that
the
california
legislation
existed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the...
part
of
the
story
is
that
this
state
legislation
was
on
the
books
before
the
executive
agreement
with
germany
and
austria
that
you've
just
applauded,
so
when
california
acted
there
wasn't
any
such
accord.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
zschernig
involved
criticism
of
a
foreign
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
geller,
said
in
that
very
agreement
there
is
to
be
no
preemption.
the
president
said
that
when
california
law
was
already
on
the
books.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
all,
mr.
geller,
would
you
clarify
all,
because
i
had
the
impression
from
the
briefs
that
there
were
only
five
companies,
and
that
they
cover
something
like
a
little
over
35
percent--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
the
universe
of...
of
claims?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
still
a
wholly
voluntary--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
is
about
a
disclosure
statute--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there's
other
legislation
that
is
not
before
us.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
are
talking
about
a
statute
that
doesn't
authorize
anybody
to
bring
suit.
it
simply
requires
disclosure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
geller,
one...
would
you
explain
one
thing
that
is
troubling?
the
privacy
interest
that
is
being
asserted,
one
can
understand
an
insured
doesn't
want
the
insurance
company
to
divulge
the
insured's
records,
but
we
are
dealing
with
a
unique
situation
here
in
that
many
of
these
insureds,
the
insureds
that
were
concerned,
were
killed
in
the
holocaust,
and
it
seems
to
me
to
raise
a
privacy
interest
with
respect
to
those
people
and
their
beneficiaries
is...
is
kind
of
ironic.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
one
know
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
list--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
was
a
list
that
was
due
out
in
april.
has--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
here
you...
that's
the
big
difference
between
those.
they
preempted
state
law.
there's
no
pretense
by...
the
executive
says
i'm
going
to
use
my
best
efforts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
you
take
what
the
president
undertook,
which
was
just
to
use
best
efforts,
that
doesn't
sound
like--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
court
would
have
much
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--with
full
knowledge,
when
the
president
did
that,
that
there
were
these
laws
in
california.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
geller,
as
i
understand
it,
this
icheic
system
is
wholly
voluntary.
there's
no
law
that
enforces
it.
and
update
me
on
something
else
that
you
did
earlier.
you
said
many
more
insurance
companies
that
were
in
it
than
35,
40
percent.
as
i
understand
it,
80
percent
of
the
claims
that
were
made
to
icheic
were
turned
down
because
the
claimants
were
not
able
to
identify
sufficiently
their
heirs
themselves--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
i
thought
that
the
only
requirement
is
put
on
a
company
licensed
to
do
business
in
the
united
states.
the...
california
isn't
reaching
out
to
grab
a
foreign
insurance
company
that
isn't
doing
business
in
the
united
states.
it
is
asking
questions
of
a
company
licensed
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
california.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
we
do
that?
does
the
united
states
do
that,
or
states
under
blue
sky
laws
in
the
securities
area?
do
we
require
disclosures
of,
say,
affiliates
that
are
set
up
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
kneedler,
suppose
there
were
no
federal
efforts
in
this
area,
which
there
weren't
for
sometime,
and
as
i
said,
the
executive
agreements
we're
talking
about
post-dated
this
california
disclosure
law,
suppose
there
was
nothing,
would
you
still
say
that
because
of
the
potential
for
interference
there
could
be
no
state
disclosure
legislation
of
this
character?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
how
does
that
relate
to
the
litigation
that
was
ongoing
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
that
i
think
involved
a
slave
labor
question?
did
the
united
states
take
a
position
that
that
litigation,
which
involved
people
who
moved
here,
or
their
survivors
moved
here
after,
that
that
was
improper
litigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
were...
one
branch
of
this
was
that
the...
the
united
states
people
who
moved
here
after,
there
was
no
connection
with
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
those
plaintiffs
were
all
people
who
were
certainly
not
in
the
united
states
when
this
happened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
were
they
in
that
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
so
of
the
companies
that
were
defendants
in
that
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
only
question
was,
did
the
united
states
take
the
position--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
stop
that
litigation--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
it
was
interfering
with
the
executive--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
barclay's
dealt
with
the
foreign
commerce
clause,
and
it
made
the
point
that
the
one
voice
in
that
area
was
congress,
not
the
president.
it
wasn't
dealing...
that
case
did
not
deal
with
executive
agreements,
as
i
recall
it,
and
i
think
i
have
a
pretty
good
memory
of
that
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
the
reason
that
barclay
said
you...
yes,
you're
right
that
the
executive
branch
was
in
there
saying
look,
all
these
foreign
countries
are
upset,
and
we
think
that
they
have
a
good
case.
that
was
the
executive
position,
and
this
court
said,
but
you're
dealing
in
an
area
where
congress
has
the
lead,
holds
the
lead
rein
and
not
the
president.
that's
the
only
point
that...
we...
when
we
were
talking
about
the
foreign
commerce
clause
authority,
that's
a
different
question
than
the
executive
authority.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
not
true
that
the...
what
the
congress
endorsed
there
was
presidential
leadership,
not
state
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kaplan,
we've
been
told
that
that...
that's
past
history--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
over
five
decades,
the
holocaust
survivors
and
their
descendants
have
tried
with
little
success
to
collect
the
insurance
proceeds
unpaid
since
the
holocaust
era.
inadequate
access
to
information
has
impeded
those
efforts.
documents
ordinarily
used
to
backup
insurance
claims,
policies
issued
to
insured
person
and
death
certificate
were
often
unavailable
to
families
of
policy
holders
who
perished
in
concentration
camps.
european
insurers
were
notably
resistant,
they
rarely
volunteered
information
needed
to
identify
rightful
holders
of
unpaid
holocaust
era
claims.
the
california
statute
at
issue,
the
holocaust
victims
insurance
relief
act
which
i
will
call
hvira,
was
enacted
in
1999
to
address
that
half
century
of
silence.
a
direct
insurance
company
is
operating
in
california
to
disclose
basic
facts
about
policies
they
or
their
affiliates
wrote
in
europe
between
1920
and
1945.
more
than
five
thousand
holocaust
survivors
reside
in
california,
information
disclosed
pursuant
to
the
hvira
could
reveal
to
survivors
or
their
heirs,
the
existence
of
a
viable
insurance
claim.
the
hvira
at
bares
emphasis
does
not
authorize
litigation
of
holocaust
era
claims
in
any
court.
it
requires
only
disclosure
of
information
such
as
to
whom
a
policy
has
issued
covering
what
risks
and
when.
the
court
today
strikes
down
the
hvira
on
the
ground
that
california's
disclosure
requirements
interfere
with
the
federal
government's
current
effort
to
resolve
holocaust
era
insurance
issues
by
diplomatic
means.
those
federal
efforts
are
embodied
in
a
series
of
executive
agreements,
the
united
states
concluded
in
the
years
2000
and
2001,
first
with
germany
then
with
austria
and
france.
the
executive
agreements
endorse
in
lieu
of
litigation
to
resolve
holocaust
era
insurance
claims,
the
administrative
processes
of
the
commission
set
up
in
1998,
the
international
commission
on
holocaust
era
insurance
claims
its
acronym
ichec.
as
the
court
recognizes
the
executive
agreements
with
germany,
austria
and
france
contain
no
reference
to
state
disclosure
law
specifically
or
even
to
the
information
disclosure
generally.
the
court
nevertheless
draws
an
inference
from
the
executive
agreements
endorsement
of
the
ichec;
implicitly,
the
court
conclude
the
foreign
policy
embodied
in
the
agreements
preempts
any
information
disclosure
mechanism
not
controlled
by
the
ichec
itself.
this
despite
the
admittedly
haulting
and
insecure
performance
of
the
ichec
since
its
inception
in
1998.
justices
stevens,
scalia,
thomas
and
i
would
not
invalidate
california’s
enactment
on
the
basis
of
the
inferential
reasoning
the
court
today
employs.
never
before
has
this
court
relied
on
an
executive
agreement
to
preempt
the
state
law
when
the
agreement
itself
did
not
so
specify,
the
judiciary
has
no
right
to
serve
as
an
expositor
of
the
nation’s
foreign
policy
by
filling
in
a
blank
so
large.
four
of
us
would
not
override
an
otherwise
permissible
state
law
by
reading
into
an
executive
accord
of
preemptive
prescription
nowhere
stated
in
the
agreement
itself.
i
agree
with
the
court
that
the
president
may
speak
with
one
clear
voice
with
the
nation
in
matters
of
foreign
affairs,
but
sustaining
hvira
would
not
undercut
that
presidential
authority,
rather,
it
would
simply
recognize
an
ambiguous
prefatory
or
gap
laden
speech
will
not
do
to
displace
laws,
federal
or
state,
properly
enacted
and
precisely
in
point.
foreign
affairs
preemption
by
presidential
decree,
i
withhold
is
properly
reserved
the
matters
actually
addressed
in
the
executive
action,
because
no
clear
statement,
indeed
no
statement
at
all,
on
information
disclosure
is
contained
in
the
executive
accords
before
us.
i
would
leave
california's
enactment
in
place
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
