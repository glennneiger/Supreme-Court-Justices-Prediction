i...
i
don't
think...
the
problem,
at
least
for
me,
doesn't
concern
the
desirability
of
the
insurance
company
practice.
i'll
concede,
absolutely
it's
totally
undesirable.
the
problem,
i
think,
for
your
side
in
my
mind
is
letters,
for
example,
from
the
deputy
under
secretary
of
state
eizenstat
to
california,
the
insurance
commissioner
and
the
governor,
about
this
very
statute,
where
he's
speaking
in
an
official
capacity
to
say
that
the
statute
has
the
unfortunate
effect
of
damaging
the
one
effective
means
now
at
hand
to
process
quickly
and
completely
unpaid
insurance
claims
from
the
holocaust
period,
that
this
law
has
already
potentially
damaged
and
could
derail
the
settlement,
et
cetera,
so
the
record
is
full
of
the
deputy
under
secretary
of
state
who
negotiated
the
settlement,
eizenstat,
ambassadors,
the
president,
lists
of...
in
treaties,
or
executive
agreements
anyway,
and
you
the...
and
you
know
what
i'm
referring
to.
all
right.
why
doesn't
all
of
that,
taken
together,
constitute
what
justice
harlan
in
dissent
in
zschernig
called
a
federal
policy
in
the
foreign
affairs
area,
so
that
if
we
take
the
dissent
in
zschernig
it
would
seem,
hypothetically,
for...
i'm
trying
to
get
your
answer...
that
that
long
list
of
things
shows
a
federal
policy
such
that
harlan
and
stewart
and
the
others,
harlan
being
at
the
extreme
there,
would
have
to
say
that
california's
statute
is
contrary
to
the
federal
policy
in
this
area,
has
an
impact
on
foreign
affairs
of
a
negative
nature
through
the
conflict
with
the
privacy
statutes
of
switzerland
and
germany,
and
therefore
is
contrary
to
the
foreign
affairs
power
given
to
the
executive
branch
by
article
2
of
the
constitution.
all
right,
that's
a
long
question,
but
those
are
the
things
that
i'd
like
you
very
much
to
focus
on
from
my
point
of
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
of
course...
of
course,
if
there
were
a
preemptive...
i'm
trying
to
bring
you
back
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
if,
in
fact,
we
had
a
preemptive
statute,
or
if
we
had
a
preemptive
treaty,
and
i
think,
but
i'm
not
sure,
that
an
executive
agreement
is
a
kind
of
treaty,
we
would
be
dealing
with
the
supremacy
clause.
we
wouldn't
be
dealing
with
the
foreign
affairs
power
of
the
president.
but
the
argument
here
is
not
the
supremacy
clause.
nobody
claims
that
there
is
preemption.
what
they
are
claiming
is,
is
that
there
is
interference
with,
in
harlan's
words,
a
federal
policy
in
the
foreign
affairs
area,
so
if
you're
taking
the
position
it
has
to
be
preemptive
under
the
supremacy
clause,
then
you're
saying
that
all
this
material
is
totally
irrelevant.
now,
that's
a
possible
position,
but
i
want
to
know
what
your
view
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
it's...
what
i've
read
to
you
is
not
an
aspiration.
what
i
read
to
you
were
statements
by
the
deputy
secretary
of
state--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
said
the
california
statute
is
totally
contrary
to
the
efforts
that
they
were
trying
to
make.
i
would...
of
course,
it's
not
legally
saying
california
is
illegal,
and
that's
why
i'm...
that's
what
i
want
you
to
explore.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
barclay's
had
to
do
with
the
commerce
clause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
being
so,
you
see,
the...
this
is
not
the
same
for
that
reason,
and
also
what
we're
talking
about
here
is,
the
governments
of
switzerland
and
the
governments
of
germany,
not
private
people,
saying
that
if
california
enforces
this
statute,
98
percent
of
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
holocaust
victims,
that
is,
the
insurance
policies
don't,
that
is,
what
we're
worried
about
under
our
privacy
statutes
is
gwendolyn
finds
out
that
uncle
harry
in
england
left
all
the
money
to
cecily
instead
of
gwendolyn
and,
of
course,
cecily
doesn't
want
that
to
occur.
that's
her
private
affair.
that's
why
germany
and
switzerland
have
laws
that
say
these
matters
are
quiet,
silent,
private,
and
those
governments
are
telling
us
that
your
statute
violates
their
privacy
law
because
of
its
overbreadth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
don't
they,
because
you
see,
as...
as
it's
been
argued
to
us
anyway,
there
are
two
ways
of
achieving
this
result.
way
number
1
would
have
privately
people
whom
you
select,
or
trust,
to
go
through
the
10
million
policies
that
were
sold,
pick
out
all
those
that
might
have
to
do
with
holocaust
victims,
and
make
them
public.
i
take
it
that's
the
route
that
secretary
eizenstat
negotiated.
the
other
way
is
california's
way,
which
is,
you
make
the
whole
10
million
public,
so
gwendolyn
and
everybody
else
finds
out
everybody
else's
information,
which
happens
to
be
a
way
that
would
violate
the
privacy
laws
of
switzerland
and
germany.
now,
what
interest
does
california
have
in
doing
it
the
second
way,
rather
than
the
first
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
if
you
agree...
the
problem
is,
if
you
agree
with
that,
that
you're
then
going
to
say
on
the
tough
kinds
of
things
that
you
raised,
how
do
we
know
if
this
is
a
cayman
island
situation
fake,
or
how
do
we
know
if
it's
a
really
genuine
important
policy
of
a
foreign
government,
say,
the
privacy
policy?
there
are
one
of
two
people
who
can
decide
that,
the
secretary
of
state
or,
say,
the
governor
or
insurance
commissioner
of
california
and
the
problem
for
you,
i
think,
is
that
the
constitution
seems
to
give
the
authority
to
decide
that
to
the
secretary
of
state
and
not
the
insurance
commissioner
of
california
because
it's
a
foreign
affairs
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean,
congress
is
supposed
to
run
foreign
affairs
on
every...
all
of
these
matters?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
letter?
i...
i...
that's
why
i
asked
the
question
at
the
beginning.
eizenstat's
letter...
it's
on
99a
of
the
appendix.
i...
i
didn't
know
whether
that's
limited
to
the
subpoena
part
or
whether
it
had
to
do
with
the
disclosure,
or
whether
it's
referring
to
the
statute
as
a
whole.
when
i
read
it,
honestly,
i
thought
it
was
the,
probably
the
statute
as
a
whole,
but
i
don't
know.
do
you
have
any
light
to
shed
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
it
could
be
the
statute
as
a
whole
he's
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
