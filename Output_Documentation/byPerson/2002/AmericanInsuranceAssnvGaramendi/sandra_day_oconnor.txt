mr.
geller,
i...
let
me
mention
a
couple
of
things
that
i
find
troubling
about
the
case,
and
one
is
that
when
congress
passed
a
law
in
this
area
it
didn't
include
any
language
preempting
state
laws
such
as
california
has,
and
when
the
president
put
out
his
executive
order
or
agreement
it
doesn't
expressly
do
so,
either.
how
does
that
affect
our
analysis,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
didn't
preclude
a
role.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
zschernig
has
never
been
cited
since
it
was
written.
it's
kind
of
a
troublesome
thing
to
hang
your
whole--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--case
on,
and
we
have
in
the
meantime
decided,
for
instance,
barclay's
bank,
which
has
some
language
in
it
that
speaks
against
recognizing
the
kind
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--authority
you
talk
about,
and
we
have
the
breard
case,
that
criminal
case,
breard
versus
greene.
now,
how
do
we
deal
with
those?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
tell
us
briefly
the
principle
of
federal
law
that
you
say
governs
this.
all
of
the
sudden
you're
talking
about
the
foreign
commerce
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
thought
earlier
in
the
argument
you
had
said,
oh,
that
really
isn't
our
case,
we
don't
need
that,
and
that's
what
zschernig--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--all
right.
well,
at
do
you--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
do
you
say
is
the
principal
flaw?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
case...
what
case
establishes
that
principle,
clear
conflict?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the...
the
president
cannot
effectively
preempt
on
foreign
policy
grounds
by
his
action
an
agreement?
do
you
take
that
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
you
could
answer
yes
or
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
there
can
never
be
a
preemption
on
foreign
policy
grounds
by
action
of
the
president
alone?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
looks
like
the
way
this
scheme
is
written
is,
the...
the
companies
doing
business
in
california
have
to
provide
the
information
even
if
they're
unable
to
do
so,
even
if
when
they
go
to
an
affiliated,
or
company
related
somewhere
down
the
line,
let's
say
in
germany
or
austria,
and
ask
for
the
information,
and
german
or
austrian
law
prohibits
that
from
being
disclosed,
then
the
california
company
will
have
its
license
yanked.
now,
what
kind
of
law
is
that?
