mr.
frank
kaplan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
california's
reporting
statute
addresses
a
despicable
practice
by
insurance
companies.
that
practice
is
the
deception
of
elderly
holocaust
survivors
in
the
refusal
to
provide
them
with
basic
policy
information.
that
stonewalling
has
occurred
for
decades,
and
it
continues
today,
and
it
continues
in
california.
california
responded
to
this
insurance--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--absolutely
not,
justice
kennedy.
the
united
states
was
well
aware
of
california's
efforts
in
this
regard.
the
1998
statute
that
was
referred
to
earlier
that
was
passed
by
congress
occurred
about
4
months
after
there
was
substantial
testimony
at
a
congressional
hearing
in
which
several
state
insurance
commissioners--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
kaplan
that's
right.
there
were...
there
were
numerous
hearings
held
by
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners
that
are
matters
of
public
record
in
1997
and
1998.
there
was
a
congressional
hearing
in
1998,
again
in
the
year
2000,
2001,
2002,
all
of
which
described
in
extensive
detail
the
stonewalling
that
had
been
committed
by
survivor...
against
survivors.
mr.
frank
kaplan
i
will,
justice
breyer.
thank
you.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
state
commercial
regulation,
and...
and,
in
fact,
we're
dealing
with
a...
an
area
of
state
regulation
that
is
a
quasi-public
business,
insurance.
it's
long
been
regulated
by
the
states.
congress
delegated
that
authority
to
the
states
60
years
ago,
and
the
states
have
been
in
that
business
ever
since.
we
believe
that
it's
congress,
not
the
executive,
that
deals
with
matters
of
foreign
commerce.
mr.
frank
kaplan
i...
i
take
the
position,
your
honor,
that
in
limited
circumstances
such
as
this
court
dealt
within
the
pink
and
belmont
case,
where
you...
you
had
the
recognition
of
a
foreign
government,
or
in
the
dames
&
moore
situation
where
you
had
a
foreign
policy
crisis
and
you--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--i
apologize,
your
honor.
would
you
repeat
the
question?
i
apologize.
mr.
frank
kaplan
no.
i
think
it's
possible
that
the
president
could
do
that
in
some
limited
circumstances
that
i've
indicated,
but
those
circumstances
do
not
exist
here.
you
have
an
expressly
nonpreemptive
executive
agreement
entered
into
after
our
law
was
passed.
the...
the
agreement
was
entered
into
after--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--sure.
mr.
frank
kaplan
our
view
is
that
where
the
executive
simply
expresses
an
aspiration
where...
which
is
the
situation
here,
where
he's
indicated
he'll
use
his
best
efforts,
it's
no
different
than--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--yes.
mr.
frank
kaplan
the
response,
justice
breyer,
is
this.
under
the
barclay's
decision,
congress
is
the
primary
authority
when...
when
dealing
with--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--it
dealt
with
both
the
commerce
clause
and
the
foreign
affairs
power.
the
zschernig
case
was
taken
for
review
by
the
court.
the
court
did
not
dispose
of
that,
and
we
believe
that
the
foreign
affairs
issue
is
subsumed
within
the
barclay's
decision
when
you're
dealing
with
matters
of
state
commercial
regulation.
mr.
frank
kaplan
yes.
mr.
frank
kaplan
foreign
governments
were
extraordinarily
upset
about
the...
the
tax
that
was
the
subject
of
the
barclay's
case.
in
fact,
the
british
government
passed
retaliatory
legislation,
and
this...
this
court
found
that
that
was
not
sufficient
when
there
was
no
specific
indication
by
congress
of
an
intent
to
bar
the
state
law.
here,
you've
had
testimony
by
deputy
secretary
eizenstat
before
congress--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--i...
i
believe,
justice
ginsburg,
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
president,
by
engaging
in
some
negotiation,
or
expressing
an
aspiration
as
to
what
the
president
thinks
the
foreign
policy
ought
to
be,
can
trump
a
state
regulation,
and
i
think
the
consequence
of
that
being
so
would
be
dramatic
for
matters
of
state
regulation,
because
state
regulation
often
has
some
sort
of
foreign
implication
to
it,
since
we're
dealing
with
a
global
economy
and
there
are
often
foreign
affiliates
that
are
called
upon
to
report
on
information,
and
if...
if
that
law
was
overturned
because
a
foreign
government
or
the
executive
branch
complained
about
that
conduct,
state
regulatory
law
would
effectively
be
thwarted.
mr.
frank
kaplan
no...
no,
your
honor--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--justice
scalia,
that's
not
correct.
the
disclosures
are
required
by
california
licensees,
including
companies
that
wrote
insurance
who
were
california
licensees.
mr.
frank
kaplan
disclosure
of
the
name
of
the
policyholder,
where
the
policyholder
lived,
and
the
name
of
the
beneficiary--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--and
the
status
of
the
policy
as
to
whether
it's
paid--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--yes,
or
their
affiliates.
or
their
affiliates.
you
have
a
situation,
for
example,
where
generali
has
been
licensed
to
do
business
in
california
since
1935--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--written
in
europe.
mr.
frank
kaplan
it's...
it's
direct--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--it's
directed
at
a
concern
that
california
has
by
reason
of
the
migration
of...
of
a
large
number
of
holocaust
survivors
to
the
state
and,
in
fact,
the
numbers
that
we've
indicated
in
our
submissions,
your
honor,
are
that
there
are
at
least
20,000
jewish
holocaust
survivors,
and
we
don't
know
how
many
non-jewish
holocaust
survivors
there
are
in
the
state.
mr.
frank
kaplan
justice
kennedy,
i...
i
guess
i
disagree.
i
think
california
has
a
substantial
concern.
it
has
a
concern
about
people
in
the
state
who
don't
have
basic
policy
information
that
they're
seeking.
mr.
frank
kaplan
california
has
an
interest
in
obtaining
information
that
companies
doing
business
in
the
state
have
so
far
exhibited
they're
unwilling
to
provide.
by
requiring
the
information
that
the
law
asks
for,
we
will
be
sure
that
there's
no
further
stonewalling
occurring
in
the
state,
and
that
companies
that
want
to
do
business
in
the
state
will
not
engage
in
that
conduct
in
the
future.
it
will
also
assure
that
people--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--it's
the
same
kind
of
law,
your
honor,
that
the
europeans
practice,
too.
we've
cited
something
in
the
record.
it's
the
european
directive
that
appears
at
2
e.r.
2747
to
2748.
european
regulators,
just
like
state
regulators,
deal
with
situations
all
the
time
where
there
may
be
a
conflict
with
a
foreign
law
or
the
law
of
another
state,
and
if
states
are...
are
able
to
effectively
regulate
the
business
that...
that
is
going
on
in
the
state
and
the
companies
doing
business
here,
they
have
to
have
the
right
to
be
able
to
apply
their
law.
otherwise,
there
could
be
a
law
established
in...
in
the
cayman
islands
that
established
a
privacy
right
for
companies
doing
business
in
the
state,
and
a...
a
company
could
assert
that
the
law
of
a
foreign
country
precluded
that
company
from...
from
complying
with
a
state
regulatory
law,
and
we
don't
think
that's
how
the
law
works.
mr.
frank
kaplan
i'm
sorry--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--no,
justice
souter.
i
think
you'd
have
a
serious
preemption
problem
there
under
the--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--yes,
it
does.
it
boils
down
to
a
separation
of--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--yes.
mr.
frank
kaplan
i
do
unless
the
executive
agreement
is
preemptive
and
unless
there's
something
else
about
the
executive
agreement
that
would
give
it
preemptive
quality.
clearly,
the
executive
agreement--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--it
might
be,
because
i
think
you'd
be
dealing
with
a
situation
there
where
arguably
it
would
be
a
preemptive
executive
agreement
which
might
carry
the
same
status
as
a...
a
statute
by
congress.
mr.
frank
kaplan
your
honor,
then
you
might
have
a
situation
like
dames
&
moore,
where
there
was
a
pattern
of
congressional
acquiescence
in
the
kind
of
executive
agreements
that
occurred
there.
mr.
frank
kaplan
then...
then
you
might
have
the
kind
of
specific
disapproval
of
state
action
that
this
court
talked
about
in
the
barclay's
case.
you
don't--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--i...
i
think
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
then
you
have
congress
acting,
you
have
congress
speaking,
which
is
what
this
court
in
barclay's
thought
was
the
appropriate
actor
to
speak
in
matters
of
foreign
commerce.
mr.
frank
kaplan
i
agree.
mr.
frank
kaplan
then
i
won't.
[laughter]
mr.
frank
kaplan
i...
i
think
actually
the...
the
constitution
gives
that
authority
to
congress,
and
if
the
executive
branch--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--congress
is
supposed
to
run
foreign...
matters
of
foreign
commerce,
including
objections
by
foreign
governments
about
the
way
states
are
behaving.
if
they...
if
they
think
they're
behaving
badly,
then
the
executive
can
go
to
congress,
lodge
a
complaint,
and
if
congress
is
so
inclined,
congress
can
do
something
about
it.
clearly,
here,
congress
has
done
nothing
about
it.
in
fact,
congress
has...
has
encouraged
the
state
statute.
there
was
testimony
before
congress.
congress
didn't
say
stop
doing
that.
congress
said,
we
bless
what
you've
done,
we
think
you're
doing
a
good
job,
keep
doing
it.
mr.
frank
kaplan
congress
said
that
in--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--there
were
statements
made
by...
by
members
of
congress
in
response
to
testimony
that
was
given,
including
the
2002
hearing--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--no,
i'm
not.
i'm
saying
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
is
the
voice
of
congress,
the--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--yes.
congress
has
approved
it
either
implicitly
or
directly
through
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
which
gives
the
states
authority
to
act
in
matters
of
insurance.
in
the
holocaust
commission
act
congress,
in
effect,
endorsed
state
action
to
deal
with
holocaust
insurance
matters.
mr.
frank
kaplan
but
in...
but
in
that
statute
congress
recognized
that
states
were
acting
in
this
area.
the
statute
said
that
the
commission
there
should
coordinate
its
activities
with
the
states,
and
it
asked
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners
to
pass...
to
prepare
a
report,
rather,
on
the
activities
of
foreign
and
domestic
insurance
companies
doing
business
in
this
country,
and
the
ninth
circuit
found,
and
we
believe
it
was
reasonable
for
it
to
find
that
congress
anticipated,
understood,
and...
and
knew
that...
that
the
states
would
be
acting
pursuant
to
state
law
and
might
have
to
seek
information
from
entities
located
outside
the
borders
of
this
country.
mr.
frank
kaplan
we
believe
that
that
would
lead
to...
to
a
situation
where,
any
time
the
executive
decides
that
there's
a
matter
of...
of
foreign
policy
concern
to
him,
legitimate
state
regulation
would
have
to
take
a
back
seat
to
that,
so
you
have,
in
essence,
presidential
lawmaking
without
any--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--any
sort
of
accountability
that
you
normally
have--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--because
except
in
limited
areas
such
as
zschernig,
in
belmont,
in
pink,
and
in
dames
&
moore,
where
you
have
a
foreign
policy
crisis
or
a
recognition,
ordinarily
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
wants
the
executive
to
go
off
and
announce
foreign
policy
issues
that
will
have
effect
on
state
regulation.
it
affects
issues
of
federalism
and
separation
of
powers.
here,
in
fact,
it
was
the
state
regulators
that
formed
icheic.
this
was
a
creature
of
the
state
regulators,
and
after
4
years
of
not
having
done
anything,
the
state
regulators
decided
that
enough's
enough,
these
people
are
not
getting
the
information.
there
were
77,000
claims
submitted.
only
700
offers
were
made,
less
than
1
percent.
these
people
are
in
a
line
to
nowhere,
because
without
this
information
they
can't
make
a
claim
to
icheic.
they
can't
even
call
the
insurance
company,
because
they
don't
even
know
which
insurance
company--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--it's
not.
mr.
frank
kaplan
there's
not,
your
honor.
there...
there's
been...
there's
expected
to
be
some
disclosure
from
german
companies.
we
don't
know
what
that's
going
to
be.
the...
insurance
was
written
all
over
europe.
the
german
market
was
only
a
small
part
of
this
european
market.
generali
wrote
insurance
all
over
eastern
europe,
and
all
the
countries
in
eastern
europe.
they
have
a
list
now
sitting
in
trieste,
italy,
with
340,000
names
on
it.
they
could
turn
that
list
over
tomorrow.
they've
refused.
there's
no
privacy
issue
involving
generali.
there's
no
italian
law
that
precludes
it.
they've
simply
refused
to
turn
it
over.
these
survivors
do
not
have
access
to
this
information.
they
do
not
know
whether
their
policies
were
written
by
generali
or
some
other
country...
company
because
they
simply
don't
have
the
information
that
enables
them
to
even
think
about
making
their
claim.
this
is
not
a
claims-paying
statute.
we're
not
asking
these
companies
to
pay
twice.
survivors
would
be
grateful
if
they
paid
once.
there's
nothing
whatsoever
in
this
statute
that...
that
deals
with
the
legitimacy
of
these
claims,
whether
they're
rightful
or
not.
it
simply
gives
these
people
information
that
allows
them
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
they
want
to
pursue
a
claim.
they
don't
have
that
ability
now.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
kaplan
i
don't
think
there's
any
violation
of
the
executive
agreements.
those
agreements
simply
provide,
with
respect
to
state
regulatory
action,
that
the
united
states
will
use
its
best
efforts.
to
me,
that's
a
recognition
and
an
understanding
that
the
federal
government
knew
that
insurance
is
a
state
matter,
a
state
regulation.
that's
all
that
the
federal
government
was
doing.
it
said,
we'll
try
our
best
to
get
the
states
to
back
off,
we're
making
no
promises
to
you
because
we
don't
think
we
have
the
authority.
we
believe
in
matters
of
insurance
it's
the
states
that
have
that
authority.
mr.
frank
kaplan
on...
on
page
17
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
this
matter
the
solicitor
general
takes
the
position
that
even
as
to
the
executive
agreements
it
only
would
have
some
preemptive
effect,
if
it
has
any
at
all,
as
to
the
companies
and
the
countries
where
the
agreements
were
made,
so
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
acknowledges
it
wouldn't
have
any
preemptive
effect
whatsoever
for
the
italian
companies,
the
swiss
companies,
or
companies
anywhere
else
in
europe.
mr.
frank
kaplan
i...
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
don't
recall
the--
mr.
frank
kaplan
--it
could
well
have
been.
mr.
frank
kaplan
thank
you
very
much.
