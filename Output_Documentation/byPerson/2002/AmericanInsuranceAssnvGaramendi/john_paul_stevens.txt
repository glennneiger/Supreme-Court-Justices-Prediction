--mr.
geller,
i
may
have
misheard
you,
but
didn't
you
describe
the
agreement
a
little
more
broadly
than
its
terms?
the
president's
agreement,
as
i
understood
it,
was
to
funnel
all
the
claims
through
the...
the...
this...
this
new
body,
and
i
don't
understand
that
producing
the
information
that's
sought
in
this
case
would
preclude
that
from
being
done.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
a
different
argument.
i
mean,
that's
not
based
on
the
text
of
the
executive
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
california...
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
california
statute
is
to...
to
uncover
claims
that
might
not
be
known
about.
it
produces
the
information
that
would
then
allow
the
claimant
to
go
to
the...
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
say
they
have
no
nexus
to
california?
is
it
not
true
that
there
are
4
or
5,000
residents
of
california
who
may
or
may
not
be
beneficiaries
of
policies
that
they
don't
know
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
right
on
that
assumption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
have
to
go
through
a
big
data
base
to
find
the
5,000.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
do
nothing
more
than
identify
policies
people
don't
know
about,
how
will
that
interfere
with
the
basic
program?
couldn't
they
then
require
those
claims
be
prosecuted
in
the
tribunal
that
they're
setting
up?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
could
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
one
aspect?
as
i
understand
it,
one
of
the
big
insurance
companies
is
an
italian
company
here
that
had...
wrote
policies
throughout
europe.
does
this...
does
the
executive
agreement
with
germany
and
austria
have
any
bearing
on
that...
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
whether
you
think
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
have
one
question,
if
i
might.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
draw
a
distinction
in
my
question
between
eizenstat's
letter,
which
in
effect
says,
please
don't
enforce
these
subpoenas
because
that
will
louse
up
our
negotiations
and
so
forth.
put
that
to
one
side,
and...
and
i
ask
you
if
you
would
agree
or
disagree
with
the
suggestion
that
if
you
do
enforce
the
subpoenas
you
will
violate
a...
a
provision
of
one
of
the
two
executive
agreements?
