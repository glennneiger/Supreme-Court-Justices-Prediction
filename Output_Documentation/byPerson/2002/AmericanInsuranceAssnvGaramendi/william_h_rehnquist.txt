insurance
association
versus
john
garamendi.
mr.
geller.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
really
a
sound
basis
for
a
decision
like
zschernig,
to
say
oregon
probate
judges
were
inquiring
about
the
policies
of
eastern
european
countries?
i
mean,
i...
i
don't
regard
that
as
a
very
strongly
reasoned
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
geller.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll

from

mr.
kaplan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
if
congress
had...
had
ratified
what
the
president
did
so
that
it's
no
longer
just
an
act
of
the
president
but
an
act
of
the
president
approved
by
congress?
would
your
position
be
any
different?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
this
isn't...
this
isn't
just
acquiescence
in
a...
in
an
executive
agreement.
this
is
congress
saying,
we
approve
and
ratify
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
way
did
congress
say
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
was
it
a
committee
report,
or
an
act
of
congress?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're...
you're
saying
that
is
the
voice
of
congress?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
just
said
a
moment
ago
that
congress
had...
had
approved
this.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kaplan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
geller,
the

--de
minimis
non
curat
lex

opinion
of
the
