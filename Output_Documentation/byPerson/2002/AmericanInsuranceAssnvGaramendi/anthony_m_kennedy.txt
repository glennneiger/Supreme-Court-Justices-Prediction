justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we
can
look
just
at
the
agreement,
isn't
this
what
is
usually
called
an
executory
agreement,
rather
than
a...
than
a
fully
executed
agreement?
in
other
words,
it
says
the
united
states,
recognizing
the
importance
of
the
objectives
of
this
agreement,
shall
in
a
timely
manner
use
its
best
efforts
in
a
manner
it
considers
appropriate
to
achieve
those
objectives.
that's...
that's
something
yet
to
be
done.
that's
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
sounds
to
me
like
executory,
rather
than
fully--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--how...
how
specifically
does
the...
does
the
california
statute
interfere
with
the
operations
of
the
commission?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
assuming
there's
a
suit
brought
later,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that
doesn't
meet
justice
stevens'
point
that
this
is
just
a
disclosure--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
take
it
you
could
make
that
argument
even
absent
the
claims
commission.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how...
how
does
it
relate
to
the...
suppose
we
want
to
link
the
harm
that
this
does
under
the
privacy
laws
to
the
operation
of
the
commission.
how
do
we
do
that?
just,
the...
the
burden
and
the
cost
to
the
companies
that
might
better
be
expended
on
the
claim--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
that's
a
separate
argument
from
the
operation
of
the
commission.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's...
that's
part
of
the
problem
i
have
with
the
executive
agreement
argument.
it
seems
executory.
it
seems
like
something
further
is
to
be
done,
in
that
case
will
use
its
best
efforts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
could
sign
a
supplemental
agreement
saying
that
we
now
agree
that
these
laws
should
be
superseded,
just
like
we
did
in
pink.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
the
united
states
unaware
of
this
problem
when
it
negotiated
an
executive
agreement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
my...
my
question
was,
was
united...
the
united
states
unaware
of...
of
the
wrongdoing
that
you're
describing
to
us,
or
the...
or
the
inappropriate
corporate
response,
and
the
answer
is,
i
assume
that
they
were,
and
they
did
nothing
about
it
in
the
executive
agreement,
other
than
to
have
this
very
specific
claims
procedure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
as
if
california
has
uncovered
something
the
united
states
didn't
know
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but...
but
that's...
the
congress
has
principal
concern
with
revenue
and
fiscal
policy.
it
doesn't
have
principal
concern
with
foreign
policy.
it's
very
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
to
that...
and
for
that
reason
california
candidly
made
specifically
reference
to
nazi-controlled
germany,
to
present-day
germany,
and
to
europe,
and
to
the
holocaust,
none
of
which
are
of
california's
concern
when
it
conflicts
with
the
president's
power
to
deal
with
those
matters.
