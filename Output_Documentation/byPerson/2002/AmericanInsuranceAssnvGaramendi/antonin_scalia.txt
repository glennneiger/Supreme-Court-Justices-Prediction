justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
can...
we
can
distinguish
those
cases.
as...
as
pointed
out
by...
by
your
adversary,
the
difference
in
this
law
is
that
it
is
only
directed
at
foreign
nations.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
disclosures
are
required
by
those
licensees?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
policies
written
by
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
policies
written
anywhere
in
the
world?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
in
other
words,
it's
only
directed
at
the
regulation
of
foreign
matters.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
can...
we
can
easily
distinguish
those...
those
california's
laws
that...
that
are
general
laws
which
have
some
indirect
effect
upon
foreign
affairs.
this...
this
thing
is
directed
at
foreign
operations.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
he
have
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
makes
laws.
the
president
doesn't
make
laws.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
president
can
make
an
executive
agreement
preemptive
which
is
not
preemptive
in
its
nature.
i
mean,
all...
all
he
can
say
is,
is
there
any...
any
state
action
which
is
inconsistent
with
our
foreign
policy
expressed
in
this
agreement
is
invalid,
but
that's
not...
not
something
that
occurs
by
reason
of
his
pronouncement.
it
occurs,
if
it
occurs
at
all,
by
reason
of
the
constitution,
automatically,
so
it
really
doesn't
matter
whether
he
says
that
or
not.
his
saying
it
cannot
make
it
happen,
and
his
not
saying
it,
i
think,
cannot
not
make
it
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
shouldn't
agree.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kaplan,
there...
there
was
a
reason,
i
think,
why
the
federal
constitution
gave
the
power
to
conduct
foreign
affairs
not
to
the
congress
but
to
the
executive,
and
the
reason
was
that
congress
is
not
a
very
good
instrument
for
that
purpose,
that
there
are
all
sorts
of
matters
that
come
up
where...
this
being
one
of
them,
where
it
is
very
difficult
for
a
member
of
congress
to
cast
a
vote
against
holocaust
victims.
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
why...
why
should
the
situation
exist
that,
although
the
president
has
the
responsibility
without
congress
for
conducting
foreign
affairs,
his
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
can
be
frustrated
by
the
states
unless
congress
comes
to
his
assistance?
why...
why
should
that
follow?
it
would
seem
to
me
it
should
follow
that
he
can
protect
this
foreign
affairs
field
on
his
own,
and
does
not
have
to
call
for
the
assistance
of
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
just
shifts...
it
just
shifts
the
inertia,
really.
congress
is
the
900-pound
gorilla.
if
it
doesn't
like
what
the
president
is
doing
in
the
field
of
foreign
affairs,
it
can
stop
him
as
quickly
as
it
likes.
all
it
has
to
do
is
pass
a
resolution
cutting
off
any
funds
for
that
purpose,
cutting
off
any
funds
for
this...
for
further
negotiations
about
this
institution.
congress
always
has
the
trump
card.
but
why
should
we...
should
we
require
congress
to
protect
the
president
from
the
states?
why
shouldn't
he
have
an
automatic
protection
from
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
it
could
be
an
acknowledgement
by
the
president
that
this
is
a
matter
that
ultimately
depends
upon
whether
his
foreign
affairs
power
is...
is...
trumps
the
state
action
in
this
field,
and...
and
it
could
be
a
commitment
by
him
to
come
to
this
court
to
ask
us
to
make
that
declaration,
which
is
not
a
declaration
that
he
can
authoritatively
make.
