oh,
but
the
relevance
of
this,
i
think
your
overall
point,
in
my
mind,
is
that
the
other
side
would
say,
i
think
they
do
say
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
there
was
an
impact,
and
as
a
result
of
the
impact...
the
thickening
of
the
lungs...
the
person
does
have
a
fear
of
getting
cancer
greater
than
most
people,
that
that's...
entitles
them
under
traditional
law
to
some
damages,
and
where
you
can
get
a
special
verdict,
it's
easy
to
see,
if
the
jury
has
awarded
too
much
damage
for
that,
in
which
case
you
get
a
reversal
under...
you
get
a
reversal
if
they
get
too
much
for
it,
and...
so
what's
the
problem
here
that
has
anything
to
do
with
there
being
6,000
plaintiffs
and
enormous
damage
and
problems
overall?
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
do
we
look
at
this
case
as
one
of
a
claim
for
traditional
pain
and
suffering
damages?
is
that
how
we
should
view
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
sounds
like
you
want
us
to
say
there
is
some
limitation
on
the
availability
of
pain
and
suffering
damages
in
the
context
of
an
asbestosis
case.
unknown
speaker
--the
apportionment.
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
which
is
so
contradictory.
unknown
speaker
i
was
going
to
ask
this.
what
if
one
of
these...
if
you
prevail,
and
then
one
of
these
plaintiffs
develops
cancer,
i
assume
he
can
go
in
and
sue
again?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
is
there
some
kind
of
a
discount
now
for
the
fear
that
he--
unknown
speaker
at
what
point
in
the
trial
did
it
become
clear,
by
a
ruling
of
the
trial
judge,
that
they
could
not
rely
on
the
exposure
in
other
areas?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
lazarus.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
