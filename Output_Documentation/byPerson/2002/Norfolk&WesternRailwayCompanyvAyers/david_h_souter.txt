david
h.
souter
did
you
ask
questions
about
the
causation
theory
that
you're
now
espousing?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
i
take
it
your
argument
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
an
association
between
asbestosis
and
a
higher
risk
of
developing
cancer,
depending
on
whether
you
smoke
and
so
on,
is
not
enough
of
an
association
to
support
a...
in
effect,
a
separate
element
of
damages
for
fear
of
cancer?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
your
authority
for
that?
in
other
words,
you're
saying
there's
got
to
be
some
kind
of
a
different,
or
more
intense
causal
relationship
than
simply
this
association
that
can
statistically
be
shown.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
basis
for
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
they
have
asbestosis?
justice
david
h.
souter
no--
justice
david
h.
souter
--they
didn't,
and
the
point
here
is
that
there
is
proof
of
asbestosis,
and
there
is
a
statistical
showing
that
you
don't
deny,
i
think,
of
a
higher
degree
of
risk,
what...
however
the
causal
chain
works...
which
associates
asbestosis
with
fear
of
cancer,
so
this
is
not
a
buckley
situation,
and
my
question
is,
why
isn't
that
statistical
association
sufficient
to
ground
an
instruction
allowing
for
compensation
for
fear
that
results
from
this
association?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
call
it
disconnect,
he
calls
it
a
connect.
what
it
is,
there
is,
i
take
it,
an
undenied
statistical
association
between
asbestosis
and
a
probability
of
developing
cancer--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
that's
the
basis
for
the
claim
of
the
fear.
why
is
that
inconsistent
with
a
common
law
theory
of
pain
and
suffering
damages?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
if
you
want
to
use
that
kind
of
terminology,
i
don't
see
why
you
haven't
got
it
here.
the
reason
these
people
are
worried
is
that
they've
got
asbestosis,
and
people
with
asbestosis
have
a
higher
chance
of
developing
cancer.
isn't
that
enough
out
of,
in
your
terms?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
are
you
saying
that
even
if
the
common
law
allowed
it,
we
should
not
allow
it
under
the
act,
or
the
act
doesn't
allow
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
have
you
got
any
authority
for
that
proposition--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
an
association
between
these
two
conditions
is
insufficient
to
support
a
damage
award?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
here...
here
we've
got
something
more.
we've
got
the
proof
that
this
is
a
serious
risk,
and
that
proof
consists
of
the
fact
that
asbestosis
has,
in
fact,
developed.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know
that
that's
your
position,
but
once
we
cross
that
threshold,
as
we
have
in
this
case...
the
threshold
that
shows
that
the
fear
is,
in
fact,
a
serious
one,
because
at
least
asbestosis
has
now
developed,
why
isn't
their
fear
of
cancer
just
as
reasonable
whether
that
fear
rests
upon
the
fact
that
in
10
percent
of
asbestosis
cases,
the
asbestosis
progresses
to
cancer...
which
isn't
true...
or,
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
same
percentage
of
asbestosis
cases,
cancer
will
also
develop
as
a
result
of
the
common
cause
for
which
the
employer
is
liable?
why
is
the
fear
any
less
reasonable
in
either
of
those
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
know
that,
and
one
of
the
questions
we
want
to
know
in
determining
whether
recovery
is
possible
is
whether
the
fear
is
reasonable.
justice
david
h.
souter
one
threshold
test
that
we
all
agree
on
is,
the
fear
has
at
least
got
to
be
confirmed
by
some
physical
manifestation.
okay,
we've
got
this
here.
once
the
physical
manifestation
is
shown,
why
is
reasonable
fear...
why
should
reasonable
fear...
not
be
enough
for
recovery,
whether
the
causal
connection
goes
from
asbestosis
to
cancer,
or
common
cause
to
cancer?
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect,
mr.
lazarus,
isn't
your...
the
bottom
line
in
this
argument
that
this
is
simply
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
because
they
didn't
provide
a
basis?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying,
forget
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
aren't
you
really
saying
that
unless
there's
an
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
in
refusing
to
send
this
to
the
jury,
based
on
what
you've
just
described,
insufficiency
of
evidence
on
their
part,
that
it's
not
in
the
case
for
us?
