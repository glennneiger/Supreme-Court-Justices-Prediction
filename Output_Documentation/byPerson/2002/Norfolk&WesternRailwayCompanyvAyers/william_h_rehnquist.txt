chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
91...
or
rather,
01-963,
norfolk
&
western
railway
company
versus
freeman
ayers.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
phillips,
under
west
virginia
practice,
is
it...
if
a
plaintiff
or
a
defendant
requests
a
special
verdict,
is
it
automatically
allowed,
or
is
it
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
salmons,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
salmons.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lazarus,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
question
presented
doesn't
speak
in
terms
of
the
instruction,
as
i
read
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
mr.
lazarus,
what
if
you
put
a
physician
on
the
stand,
and
the
physician
says,
this
man
was
25
years
old
when
he
was
injured,
he
ordinarily
would
be
expected
to
live
to
be
75,
but
as
a
result
of
this
injury.
he's
only
going
to
live
to
be
72?
now,
is
that
the
sort
of
thing
that's
compensable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
lazarus,
is
their
increased
chance
of
cancer
because
they
have
asbestosis,
or
because
the
asbestosis
originates
from
their
exposure
to
asbestos,
and
it's
the
exposure
to
asbestos,
not
the
asbestosis,
that
will
cause
cancer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
then
you
do
challenge
the
statement
by
your
opponents
that
asbestosis
itself
cannot
change
into
cancer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no,
now,
wait
a
minute--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
asked
you
a
question.
what's
the
answer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
challenge
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
i
ask
you
one
other--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
isn't
automatic
in
most
jurisdictions,
mr.
lazarus.
you
can't
say
"i
want
a
special
verdict",
and
if
the
court
says
"no,
i
don't
think
i'll
give
you
one.
"
that's
pretty
much
the
end
of
it,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well
now,
how
do
we
know
that?
you're
saying
he
worked
in
the
place
with
the
highest
concentrations
so
far
as
the
railroad
is
concerned,
but
how
do
we
know
how
that
compares
with
where
he
worked
elsewhere?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-963,
norfolk
and
western
railway
company
versus
ayers
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
