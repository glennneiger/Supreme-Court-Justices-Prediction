is
it
conceded...
i
think
you
said
it
was
conceded,
but
is
it
conceded
that
fear
of
cancer
does
not
emanate
from
asbestosis?
if
it's
clear
that
you
have
a
greater
risk
of
cancer
if
you
have
contracted
asbestosis,
why
isn't
the
fear
connected
to
the
asbestosis?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what...
i
mean,
what...
unlimited
damages,
i
don't
know
what
you
want
us
to
do.
what
if
the
statistical
chance
of
your
getting
cancer
if
you
have
asbestosis
is...
is
your
chances
are
doubled.
would
that
be
enough
to
create
the
kind
of
a
fear
that
we
could
allow
damages
for
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it's
90
percent
certain
that
if
you
have
developed
asbestosis,
you
will
develop
cancer?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so
it's
somewhere
between
50
and
90
percent?
justice
antonin
scalia
why--
--isn't
that
a
jury
question?
do
we
know
for
sure
that
the
one
does
not
lead
to
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
the
respondents
agree
with
you
on
that
factual
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
no...
no,
that...
that
asbestosis
does
not
lead
to
cancer,
but
rather,
is...
is
produced
by
the
same...
by
the
same
cause
that
produces
cancer?
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
question
wasn't
put
to
the
jury.
i
mean,
the
fact
is
that
the
jury
was
not
required
to
find
that
the
fear
was
a
fear
that
the
asbestosis
would
turn
into
cancer.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
what...
allocate
out...
how
does
that...
the
money
is
still
paid
to
this
claimant,
so
that
when
the
person
who
actually
has
cancer
comes
into
court,
this
company
is
bankrupt.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
disproportionate?
