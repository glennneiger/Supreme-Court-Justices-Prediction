it
would
be
something
different
than
one
would
think
of
in
a
traditional
pain
and
suffering
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
you're
arguing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
was
it...
was
the
case
presented
as
a
separate
claim
for
negligently-caused
emotional
distress?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
it
was
a
pain
and
suffering
argument.
that's
what
it
was,
wasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
pain
and
suffering.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
i
thought
that's
what
we
were
confronting
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
can
include
fright.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
does
appear
to
be
a
minority
of
jurisdictions
that
have
said...
and
have
held...
that
you
have
to
show
as
a
plaintiff
in
a
case
like
this
a
verifiable
causal
nexus
between
cancer
and
the
injury
suffered
in
cases
where
you're
dealing
with
exposure
to
a
hazardous
material.
that...
maybe
that's
a
reasonable
requirement,
but
it
appears
to
be
a
minority
view.
are
you
suggesting
that
we
should
adopt
that
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
you...
do
you
think
we
should
adopt
an
interpretation
of
fela
that
says
there
has
to
be
some
verifiable
causal
nexus?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
acknowledge
that
that
is
a
view
that
is
generally
a
minority
view
in
the
country?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
may
make
sense,
but
i
just
want
to
know
where
we
are
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
phillips,
i
know
your
light
is
on,
but
there's
a
second
question
and
you
haven't
even
talked
about
it,
the
joint
and
several
liability--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
wasn't
sure
that
there
was
any
support
in
the
statute
or
in
the
evidence
at
trial
here
for
how
some
apportionment
should
have
been
made.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
say
this
case
is
not
brought
on
this
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
do
we...
573?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
some
jurisdictions
go
further
these
days
and
require
there
be
a
reasonable
causal
nexus?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
there
were
a
few
that
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
that
emotional
fear
ought
to
be
one
that
is
reasonable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
a
causal
nexus
there
between
the
asbestosis
and
the
fear?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
should
be,
shouldn't
there?
