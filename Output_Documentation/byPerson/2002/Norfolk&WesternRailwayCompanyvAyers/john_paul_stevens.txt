john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that,
the
fact
that
it's
one
element
doesn't
mean
it's
the
primary
element,
does
it?
they
did
all
suffer
physical
impairment
as
a
result
of
the
asbestosis
itself,
did
they
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
do
you
know
that
the
physical
impairment
was
not
the
primary
ingredient
in
the
jury
verdict.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
said
it
was
the
primary
element
of
damages,
and
that's
what
i
think
justice
breyer
and
i
are
wondering
whether
the
record
really
supports
that
element--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--did
the
defendant--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
in
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
this
question?
i
really
wanted
to
ask
it
of
mr.
phillips,
but
his
time
was
running
out.
would
you
draw
a
distinction
between
a
case
in
which
the
asbestosis
actually
is
a
cause
of
cancer,
as
opposed
to
a
case
like
this,
in
which
asbestos
and
cancer...
asbestosis
and
cancer...
are
the
result
of
a
common
cause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
say--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
you
would
say
that
in
this
case,
then,
if
it
were
true,
which
i
understand
it
is
not,
that
the
asbestosis
itself
is
a
contributing
cause
to
cancer,
that
then
there
would
be
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
taking
all
those
things
into
account,
what
do
you
do
in
a
case
in
which
the
cancer
is
a
result
of
the
asbestosis
rather
than
the
result
of
a
common
source?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
i
had
is,
if
there
is
a
causal
correlation,
if
50
percent
of
the
people
who
have
contracted
asbestosis
as
a
result
of
exposure
to
asbestos
will
also
contract
cancer,
why
does
that
matter?
that's
what
i
didn't
quite
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i
understand...
i
think
you
do
correctly
state
their...
they
agree
with
you
on
the
facts
on
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
do,
may
i
ask
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
one
quick
question.
do
you
agree
with
mr.
phillips'
appraisal
of
the
facts
as...
we
should
assume
that
the
fear
of
cancer
was
the
major
element
of
damages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you,
you
say
there's
no
evidence
of
what
the
degree
of
exposure
in
other
areas,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
didn't
they
make
any
offers
of
proof
with,
or
did
they
just
the
prove
the
time
that
they
worked--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
but
then
that
would
be
a
question
of
the
weight
of
that
evidence,
rather
than
whether
they
preserved
the
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
pathways
of
exposure--
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
but
they
did
request
an
instruction,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
point
was
preserved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
but
that
theory,
then,
is
that
several
liability
would
have
been
appropriate
if
the
evidence
were
sufficient?
