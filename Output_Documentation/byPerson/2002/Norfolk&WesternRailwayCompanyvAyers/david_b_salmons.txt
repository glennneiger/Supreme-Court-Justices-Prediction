mr.
david
b.
salmons
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
may
not
recover
damages
under
fela
for
their
anxiety
about
developing
cancer
in
the
future
as
part
of
their
emotional
injuries
from
the
separate
disease
of
asbestosis.
the
overwhelming
majority
of
courts
that
have
considered
the
relationship
between
asbestosis
and
cancer
have
concluded
that
they
are
separate
diseases
that
result
in
separate
injuries
to
the
plaintiff--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--and
give
rise
to
separate--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
i
do
think
there
would
be
a
difference
between
those
two
instances.
here,
the
court
can
look
to
the
evolving
tort
law
principles
in
cases
involving
asbestos,
where
the
overwhelming
majority
of
courts
have
concluded
they
are,
indeed,
separate
diseases
with
no
causal
connection
between
them
only
in
the
sense
that
they
both
stem
from
the
same
exposure--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--to
asbestos.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that...
you
know...
the
court
may
still
need
to
look
at
what
type...
what
exactly
the
causal
connection
is...
and
it
would
still
need
to
take
into
account
both
the
text
and
the
purposes
of
fela,
and...
and
in
particular,
the
concern--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i...
i
do
think,
your
honor,
that
if...
that
if
the
cancer,
in
fact,
results
directly
from
the
disease
of
asbestosis,
then
that
puts
you
more
directly
in
the
category
of
pain
and
suffering
damages
that
would
be
available
traditionally
in
tort
law,
and
that
probably
would
be
recoverable
there,
but--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i
do
think,
your
honor,
that
this
court
can
look
to
the
experience
of
courts
that
have
considered
the
relationship
between
the
two
diseases,
and
have
adopted
legal
rules
to
govern
the
disposition
of
these
claims,
and
have
concluded
that
they
are
separate
diseases
that
result
in
separate
injuries
and
give
rise
to
separate
causes
of
action,
and
i
think
this
court
can
look
to
that
and...
and...
and
can
conclude
that
as
a
matter
of
law
both
because
of--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that
the
majority
of
courts
have
concluded--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
i
do
think
that
the
respondents
have
taken
that
position
in
this
case.
on
page
20
of
their
brief,
they
say
that
the
relationship
between
asbestosis
and
cancer
is
two-fold.
first,
the
asbestosis
confirms
the
extent
and
severity
of
the
initial
exposure
to
asbestos
which,
of
course,
under
buckley
is
not
a
separate
injury
or
impact
that
can
give
rise
to
liability
under
fela,
and
second,
that
they
both...
both
the
cancer
and
the
asbestosis
would
result
from
the
same
negligent
conduct
of
the
defendant,
but
i
do
not
read
respondents
to
be
alleging
in
this
court
that
there
is
any
causal
relationship
between
cancer
and
asbestosis
in
terms
of
asbestosis
actually
turning
into
cancer.
there
may
be
a
correlation,
but
you
know,
that...
the
reasonableness
of
the
fears
is
really
not
the
question.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i...
i
think--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
terms
of...
of
the
existing
tort
law
principles
that,
as
this
court
noted
in
gottshall,
and
even
prior
to
that
around
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
fela,
that
pain
and
suffering
damages
are
limited
to
those
damages
that
flow
directly
from
the
injury
that
allows
you
to
sue,
and
that--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
way
the
court
below
approached
the
question.
we
think
the
problem
with
that
is
that,
as
the
overwhelming
majority
of
courts
that
have
considered
the
issue
of
the
relationship
between
the
diseases
have
concluded,
they
are
separate
diseases
that
result
in
separate
injuries
and
separate
causes
of
action,
and
the
test
of
fela--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
we
do
think
it
is
instructive,
however,
your
honor,
and
that's
particularly
true
because
fela
provides
for
liability...
to
any
person
suffering
injury
while
employed...
for
such
injury,
and
we
think,
consistent
with
the
text
of
that
statute,
which
limits
the
employer's
liability
to
the
injury
that's
actually
suffered,
and
not
the
fear
of
suffering
a
future...
injury
in
the
future...
that
the
rule
we
are
propounding
today
is
the
most
consistent
with
that
text
and
the
most
consistent
with
the
purposes
and...
and
policy
considerations
this
court
articulated
in
both
gottshall
and
buckley,
and
in
particular--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--it
is
true,
your
honor,
that
people
who
now
have
asbestosis
and
fear
getting
cancer
in
the
future
may
never
get
cancer.
in
fact,
the
overwhelming
number
of
them
won't
get
cancer--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--but--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that
is
true,
your
honor,
and
that's
also
true
for
the
snowmen
of
metro-north
that
were
at
issue
in
buckley.
the
court...
this
court
did
not
say,
though,
their
fears
were
not
reasonable.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
had
found
that
they
were.
what
this
court
said
was,
they
didn't
fit
within
the
common
law
categories
that
allowed
recovery
because
the
exposure
itself
was
not
an
impact
or
injury,
and
our
position
is
that
while
the
asbestosis
gives
them
an
ability
to
sue
for
their
injuries
related
to
that
asbestosis,
they
cannot
reach
back
to
that
initial
exposure
and
recover
the
damages
that
were
precluded
in
buckley,
namely--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that
is
correct,
and
they
can
recover
for
all
of
their
harms
related
directly
to
that
asbestosis,
but
our
position
is
they
can't
recover
for
their
fears
of
the
future
disease
of
cancer--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
with
respect,
we
don't
think
the
question
is
whether
their
fears
are
reasonable,
but
their
question
is
whether
their
fears
are
recoverable
at
this
time.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
and
we
do
not--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
we
think
that
one
of
the
primary
reasons
why
it
should
not
be
enough...
that
reasonableness
of
the
fear
should
not
be
enough
in
and
of
itself...
even
assuming
for
a
moment
that
the
statistics
that
are
at...
that
were
in
evidence
here
are,
in
fact,
sufficiently
conclusive
to
draw
those
assumptions...
i
mean,
i
do
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
this
court
in
buckley
referred
to
these
same
types
of
figures
as
being
uncertain
and
controversial,
and
i
think
that
that
description
is
probably
still
true
here.
but
the
purposes
and
policies
of
fela,
which
this
court
recognized
in
buckley,
and
in
particular
the
fear
that
plaintiffs
with
relatively
minor
injuries
now
will
come
into
court
being
drawn
by
the
opportunity
to
get
front-loaded,
significant
damages
for
future
harms,
will
end
up
frustrating
the
system,
and
will
end
up
hurting
the
plaintiffs
that
in
fact
develop
cancer
later,
and
i
think
that
this
case
implicates
those
policies
and
concerns
of
fela
and
tort
law
generally
just
as
much
as
was
the
case
in
buckley,
that
the
vast
majority,
the
number
of
people
that
will
actually
get
cancer
in
the
future
is
relatively
low,
and
there
is
a
significant
risk--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--thank
you.
