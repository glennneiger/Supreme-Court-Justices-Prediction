mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
only
issue
raised
by
the
first
question
presented
in
the
cert
petition
is
whether
the
trial
court's
jury
instruction
correctly
described
the
legal
standard
for
when
a
physically
injured
plaintiff
can
recover
for
related
emotional
distress
injury,
and
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
the
jury's
application
of
that
legal
standard
to
the
evidence
at
trial
is
not
one
of
the
questions
presented
in
this
case,
and
it
is
quite
clear
that
the--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
but
the
question
poses
a
pure
question
of
law,
and
that
is
whether,
when
you
have
a
physical
injury,
what
the
relationship
has
to
be
between
the
emotional
distress
and
the
physical
injury,
and
our
argument,
your
honor,
is
that
under
traditional
tort
law,
it
is
not
required
that
the
emotional
stress
immediately
accompany
the
physical
injury;
that
it
have
its
own
physical
manifestations;
that
it
be
severe.
tort
law,
as
this
court
explained
in
the
metro-north
case,
approaches
the
recovery
for
emotional
distress
injury
from
a
categorical
perspective,
and
tort
law
categorically
distinguishes
between
two
different
situations.
first,
the
situation
where
one
has
a
stand-alone
claim
for
negligent
infliction
of
emotional
distress
where
the
emotional
injury
itself
is
the
element
of
the
offense,
the
injury
element,
and
second,
the
so-called
parasitic
damage
context,
where
there
is
a
threshold
physical
injury
which
supplies
the
essential
element,
and
what
many
courts
do
is
they
impose
very
significant
limitations
on
the
recovery
of
emotional
distress
in
the
stand-alone
context
such
as
physical
manifestations,
immediacy,
and
severity,
but--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--the
jury
instruction
is
reproduced
on
page
573
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
573
on
the
joint
appendix,
and
that
jury
instruction
makes
it
absolutely
clear
that
respondents
were
entitled
to
recover
for
their
reasonable
fear
of
cancer
as
part
of
their
overall
damages
only
to
the
extent
that
that
fear
related
to...
the
court's
words...
related
to
proven
physical
injury,
and
there
is
absolutely
no
merit
to
petitioner's
argument--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--your
honor,
almost
no
jurisdictions
do.
there
are
really
only
two
cases--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--but
almost
all
the
cases
go
the
other
way,
and
the
reason,
your
honor,
is
because...
there's
some
confusion
in
petitioner's
argument
here
about
what
"pain
and
suffering"
means.
if
you
look
at
the
jury
instruction
very
closely
on
page
573,
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
was
very
careful,
knew
exactly
what
he
was
doing.
in
the
paragraph
right
before
the
"fear
of
cancer"
paragraph,
he
refers
to
the
entitlement
of
a
physically
injured
plaintiff
to
recover
for
physical
and
mental
pain
and
suffering.
in
the
next
paragraph,
where
he
refers
to
reasonable
fear
of
cancer,
he
refers
only
to
mental
pain
and
suffering,
and
this
is
a
longstanding
distinction
in
tort
law.
physical
pain
and
suffering
is
the
kind
of
pain
which
is
immediate
and
intimately
associated
with
the
bodily
injury.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
your
honor,
it's
really--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--it's
open
and
shut.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
if
one
looks
to
the
restatement
of
torts,
section
456,
which
ascribed...
well-settled,
widely
applied,
and
it
describes
the
circumstances
when
a
physically
injured
plaintiff
can
recover
for
related
emotional
distress
injuries.
it
fits
this
case,
and
it
includes
in
comment
c,
it
expressly
denies
the
validity
of
their
physical
manifestation
requirements--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
your
honor,
one
really
can't
in
the
beginning
start
to
entertain
their
evidence
that
they've
introduced
which
wasn't
part
of
the
trial
record
in
this
case.
the
trial
record--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
actually,
it
may
well
be
more,
but
let's
put
that
aside.
what
is
quite
clear,
your
honor,
as
this
court
explained
in
the
metro-north
case,
is
that
just
because
there
are
background
risks,
that
doesn't
mean
that
one
can't
have
a
reasonable
apprehension
based
on
an
increased
risk.
for
instance,
it
is
100
percent
sure,
your
honor,
that
every
one
of
us
in
this
room
will
die.
we
have
a
background
risk.
but
the
fact
that
someone
through
negligent
conduct
causes
us
a
physical
injury
which
increases
our
risk
of
dying
sooner
does
not
mean
we
can
recover
for
that.
and
the
place
to
look
in
the
restatement
of
torts,
your
honor,
to
see
that
this
is
a
classic
thing
that
one
can
recover
for,
if
you
look
to
section
456,
you
look
to
comment
c,
and
then
it
referenced
comment...
it
referenced
restatement
section
905,
and
restatement...
and
it
says
that
when
you
have
a
physical
injury,
then
it
triggers
the
whole
panoply
of
emotional
distress
injuries,
and
section
905
of
the
restatement
of
torts
describes
what
is
encompassed
by
"emotional
distress",
and
comment
e
describes
how
it
goes,
as
always,
to
fear,
anxiety,
apprehension
of
future
consequences.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know...
i
don't
doubt,
your
honor,
that
in
tort
law,
that
there
is
a
level
of
probability
of
risk
below
which
one
can
say
as
a
matter
of
law
there's
not
a
reasonable
apprehension.
i
don't
think,
though,
in
this
case,
first
of
all,
that
there's
any
question
that
statistics
support
a
reasonable
apprehension,
but
even
more
importantly,
the
question
whether
they
do
or
don't
in
this
case
is
not
one
of
the
issues
here.
the
issue
is
whether
that's
enough.
the
issue
is
whether
you--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
your
honor,
because
as
the
court,
i
think,
explained
quite
well
in
buckley,
the
way
tort
law
approaches
the
question
is
on
a
categorical
basis
and
distinguishes
between
those
with
physical
injury,
because
if
you
have
that
threshold
physical
injury,
that
gives
you
the
corroborating
evidence
you
need
that
you
have,
now,
a
legitimate
plaintiff...
a
legitimate
plaintiff...
who
has
established
their
cause
of
action.
you're
not
adding
new
cases
to
the
docket,
and
even
more
importantly,
as
the
court
has--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
those
who
have
asbestosis,
as
the
trial
record
in
this
case
referred,
those
with
asbestosis
have
a
statistically
higher
significance
of
getting
the
other
kinds
of
cancers,
because
what...
it's
not
just
a
mere
exposure,
unimpaired,
and
what
the
asbestosis
requirement
does
by
requiring
that
kind
of
serious
physical
injury
is,
as
everyone
understood,
and
the
rail
industry
argued
in
metro-north,
it
dramatically
limits
the
number
of--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--possible
plaintiffs.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
your
honor,
we
do
not
know,
and
no
one
knows,
whether
the
asbestosis
itself
transforms
itself
into
cancer.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
your
honor,
their
own
experts--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes.
yes.
i--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--i
do.
i
do
challenge
that.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
their
own
expert,
your
honor,
on
page
470
of
the
joint
appendix,
dr.
renn...
their
expert...
testified
on
page
470
that
one
could
not
contract
lung
cancer
from
exposure
to
asbestos
until
one
had
asbestosis.
we're
willing
to
admit
that
the
science
is
more
unclear
that
asbestos...
whether
it
actually
transforms
itself
or
not,
we
don't
know,
and
we
don't
think
as
a
matter
of
law
it's
necessary.
it
was
their
expert
at
trial
who
testified
that
actually
to
get
lung
cancer
from
asbestos
exposure,
it
was
a
necessary
prerequisite
to
first
have
asbestosis.
we
think--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
we...
and
we
think
that
was
not
an
error
in
the
jury
instructions.
there's
many
cases
out
there...
let
me
refer
to
this
one
case,
a
case
they
cite
in
their
reply
brief
on
page
2--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--right,
and
it
has
to
be
related
to
the
proven
physical
injury,
and
it
was
in
this
case.
if
i
can
give
the
example--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--right,
your
honor,
and
that's
where
the
court
got
it
actually--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no.
no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
what
the
court
is
doing
here
is
exactly
what
courts
do
who
adopt
the
separate
disease
rule
which
says,
you
can
only
recover
for
your
present
injuries
now,
and
you
can't
recover
for
future
injuries.
the
cancer
itself,
or
the
risk,
is
a
future
injury.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
right,
yes,
for
the
cancer.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
no,
just
like
there
are
separate
causes
of
action
for
assault
and
battery.
those
are
two
different
injuries.
the
apprehension
of
something
is
a
separate
injury,
and
for
these
plaintiffs...
the
respondents...
it
is
a
current--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no.
no.
the
fear
would
not
be...
the
cancer
would
be--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--i...
sorry,
i
wasn't...
if
you've
recovered
once,
you
aren't
going
to
be
allowed
to
recover
again.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes.
if
you'd
brought
the
first--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--i'm
sorry.
i
thought
your
question
was
whether
they
could
recover
for
cancer
in
the
second
one.
i
didn't
understand
you
were
referring
to--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--your
honor,
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
think
this
issue
has
come
up,
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
bar
to
the
recovery
here.
if
i
can
refer
to
the
radiation
burn
case
that
they
referred
to
on
page
2
of
the
reply
brief--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not
problematic,
because
we
have
a
present
injury,
and
where
you
have
a
present
physical
injury
and
you
have
a
present
emotional
injury,
an
apprehension
based
on
that,
those
are
two
types
of
injuries.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
your
honor,
we
do
think
there
is
a
causal
nexus--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--we...
but
we
do
think
there's
a
causal
nexus
here,
and
under
the
restatement
of
torts,
all
right,
there
are
two
different
possible
causal
nexus
under
section
456
of
the
restatement.
we
actually
think
both
of
those
are
met,
and
that
is,
we
think
that
the
fear
is
caused
by
the
physical
injury.
it's
also
caused
by
the
same
negligent
conduct,
but
that
is
also
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
question,
and
what
they
are
positing
here
is
what
the
legal
standard
should
be
for
physically
injured
plaintiffs
and
the
recovery
for
related
emotional
stress
harm.
an
example,
the
anderson
case
they
cite
on
page
2
of
their
reply
brief...
a
radiation
burn
case...
which
they
say
is
distinct
from
this
case.
it's
exactly
the
same
as
this
case.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
way
to
address
that
kind
of
issue
is
not
to
change
decades
of
settled
tort--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes,
there
is.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
there
is.
there
is--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--and
what
can
be
done
in
a
case
like
that
is,
the
defendant
in
that
case
can
request
a
verdict
form
which
requires
the
jury
to
allocate
out,
and
that
would
allow
a
judge
and
an
appellate,
if
appropriate,
to
review,
and
jury
trials--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--trials,
it
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
your
honor,
they
didn't
request
one
here,
but
that
is
the
proper
way
to
address
the
issue,
and
that's
why
you
see--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
but
your
honor,
it
addresses
justice
breyer's
concern,
and
that
is,
it
allows
you
to
have
a
record
upon
which
one
can
make
sure
that
the
jury
hasn't
awarded
a
disproportionate
amount
based
upon
this
one
element,
that
you
don't
have
the
tail
wagging
the
dog.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
your
honor,
it's
a
reasonable
apprehension.
this
is
why
there's
an
objective
standard
which
applies
to
emotional
recovery
which
doesn't
require
the
physical.
it
has
to
meet
an
objective
standard.
if
someone
has
a
very,
very
thick
skin
in
tort
law
and
they,
in
fact,
as
a
result
of
that,
don't
suffer
damage,
then
they
haven't
suffered
damage.
if
they
have
a
very,
very,
very
thin
skin,
and
they
suffer
a
lot
of
damage,
then
they
don't
recover
everything--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--unless
it's
a
reasonable
apprehension.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
your
honor,
that
might
be
possible.
that
is
not
an
issue
which
has
been
addressed
here
before
this
court,
and
i
haven't
looked
at
the
issue
preclusion
there
between
the
two.
what
is
clear
is,
if
you
have
a
current
physical
injury--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes,
right,
and
it's
not
an
issue
which
has
been
briefed
here,
because
i
think
that
when
you
have
a
case
like
this
with
a
present
physical
injury,
and
you
have
a
present
emotional
injury
based
on
that,
or
as
this
court
has
actually
said
in
metro-north,
related
to
the
physical
injury,
that's
sufficient.
i
would
like...
if...
to
address
the
second
issue,
with
the
court's--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
your
honor.
all
one
has
to
assume
here
is
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
give
some
money
based
on
fear
of
cancer,
not
that
they
had
to,
and
not,
certainly,
that
they
gave
$4.4
million,
just
sufficient
evidence
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
have
given
a
dollar,
or
some
money.
that's
all
that
would
be
necessary.
the
second...
sorry.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes,
your
honor.
there
is...
there's
lots
of
record
evidence
in
this
case
to
establish
the
asbestosis
and
how
there
may
have
been
different
degrees
of
asbestosis.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
your
honor,
for
very
simple
a
reason.
the
first
reason
is
that
we
think
that
fela
itself
on
its
face
actually
directs
there
to
be
joint
and
several
liability
when
you
have
single
injuries.
that's
our
first
argument,
that
fela
on
its
face
answers
the
question,
or
that
fela
provides
that
the
railroad
should
be
liable,
quote,
"for
such
injury
or
death
resulting
in
whole
or
in
part
from
the
negligence
of
the
railroad.
"
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
your
honor--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no.
the
background
principle
of
the
common
law
of
torts
here
is
that
there
are...
if
there
is
a
single
injury,
then
there
is
joint
and
several
liability
unless
there's
a
reasonable
basis
for
apportionment.
our
threshold
argument--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--assuming
that
fela
doesn't
answer
the
question,
let
me
answer
it
based
upon
the
common
law.
because
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden...
sorry,
the
defendant...
petitioner
has
the
burden
in
that
case
to
establish
1)
what
the
doses
were,
and
2)
what
the
dose
relationship
was,
and
the
one
thing
we
know
here,
the
prototype
example
that
mr.
phillips
referred
to
is
mr.
butler,
and
the
fact
is
that
mr.
butler
apparently
worked
for
three
months
exposed
to
asbestos
for
petitioner,
and
for
many,
many
years
exposed
to
asbestos
at
other
workplaces.
while
we
don't
know
what
the
dose
relationship
is,
your
honor,
we
do
know
for
the
record
the
one
thing
the
dose
relationship
isn't
is
time.
one
can't
compare
one
time
to
another.
let
me
tell
you
why
we
know
that.
on
page
420
of
the
joint
appendix,
their
expert
testified
that
one
is
far
more
likely
to
contract
asbestosis
from
high
concentrations
over
a
short
period
of
time
than
low
concentrations
over
a
long
period
of
time,
and
there's
a
reason
for
that.
as
dr.
brody
explains
on
page
87
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
lungs
can
naturally
rid
themselves
of
the
fibers
at
the
low
concentrations.
it's
only
at
the
high
concentrations...
the
macrophages.
it's
only
at
the
high
concentrations
that
the
lungs
can't
rid
themselves
of
the
fibers.
while
we
have
no
idea
how
low
the
concentrations
levels
were
at
these
other
workplaces,
we
do
know
how
high
the
concentrations
levels
were
at
petitioner's
workplace,
because
mr.
butler
testified
on
page
249
of
the
joint
appendix
that
during
those
three
months,
he
worked
in
the
location
of
petitioner's
workplace
where
the
asbestos
concentrations
were
at
the
highest.
mr.
butler
testified
that
he
worked
in
the
room
where
the
engines
were
stripped
of
their
fibers,
and
more
fibers
were
placed
on.
he
testifies
on
page
249
he
looks
at
these
same
pictures,
which
were
trial
exhibits...
they're
reproduced
in
our
brief.
he
looks
at
these
pictures
and
he
says,
yes,
that's
the
kind
of
room
i
worked
in.
this
is
249
and
250.
yes,
that's
the
kind
of
exposure
i
faced.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
so
we
know
he
had
the
very
high
concentrations--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--your
honor,
we
have
no
idea,
and
they...
because
they
never
introduced
or
sought
to
introduce
any
evidence,
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
very
low
concentrations...
here
we
can
turn
to
the
rand
report,
which
they
filed
with
this
court...
lodged
with
the
court...
just
two
weeks
ago.
the
rand
report
and
the
testimony
of
this
case
makes
absolutely
clear
that
in
low
concentration
employment
centers,
at
low
concentration
exposures,
one
is
very
unlikely
to
have
any
kind
of
physical
injury,
asbestosis
or
cancer
ever
develop,
which
is
why
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
plaintiffs,
many
of
which
come
from
low
exposure,
which,
as
the
rand
report
makes
clear,
is
not
likely
to
lead
to
any
kind
of
disease.
we
have
no
idea
how
low
it
was
here.
we
know
how
high
it
was
here.
i
have
no
doubt,
your
honor,
that
petitioner
would
have
been
very
hard-pressed
at
trial
to
actually
show
what
the
doses
were,
and
to
show
what
the
dose
relationship
is,
but
what
i
do
know
is,
whatever
their
reason
was
at
trial
for
never
trying
to
introduce
this
evidence,
and
they
never...
if
you
looked
at
their
motion,
where
they
made
the
motion
for
this
jury
instruction,
they
never
even
remotely
suggest
what
the
basis
for
apportionment
would
be,
but
whatever
their
strategic
reason
for
doing
that
at
trial,
what
is
absolutely
clear
is
they
are
not
allowed
in
the
first
instance
to
come
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
and
proffer
newspaper
articles,
magazine
articles,
selected
journal
articles
and
try
to
argue
that
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
apportionment,
or
they're
entitled
to
a
remand
to
litigate
a
issue
which
they
failed
to
litigate
in
the
first
instance.
the
simple
truth,
your
honor,
is
that
at
trial
in
this
case
the
respondents
established
all
of
their
essential
elements
of
their
negligence
cause
of
action.
they
established
their
physical
injury,
and
they
received
a
jury
award
which
certainly,
compared
to
the
jury
awards
that
i
see
mentioned
in
the
amicus
briefs,
is
a
jury
award
which
seems
relatively
modest,
and
certainly
a
jury
award
which
on
its
face
doesn't
suggest
that
there
was
some
outrageous
amount
given
for
reasonable
fear
of
cancer.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
they
really
just
proved
the
time.
they...
we
know
the
nature
of
the
work,
but
what
we
don't
know,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
your
honor,
i'm
not...
they
never
offer
a
basis
of
apportionment.
we'd
have
to
know,
and
the
evidence
at
trial
made
clear,
to
know
the
dose
and
dose
relationship
you'd
have
to
know
the
air
flow
rates.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--your
honor,
they
were
not
denied
this
opportunity
at
trial
to
introduce
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
non-railroad
employment,
and
you
can
see
that
because
they
actually
did
do
some
cross-examination,
they
did
try
to
introduce
the
evidence
of
three
months,
they
did
try
to
refer
to
the
other
workplaces,
they
could
have
tried
to
introduce
more
evidence.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
we
thought
it
was
irrelevant,
your
honor,
but
they
were
clearly
thinking
about
the
possibility
of
requesting
an
apportionment
instruction,
but
the
fact
is,
they
never
laid
out
a
reasonable
basis.
if
you
look
at
the
memorandum--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--they
did
request
the
instruction,
but--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--right,
but
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
denying
the
instruction
because
they
had
not
met
their
burden
of
proffering
a
reasonable
basis
for
apportionment,
and
in
the
absence
of
that
evidentiary
basis,
the
trial
court
was
absolutely
correct
in
denying
it.
this
was
a
jury
verdict,
your
honor,
this
was
reached.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
no,
your
honor.
our
threshold
argument
is
that
it
would
not...
asbestosis,
this
is
a
classic
individual
injury.
there
are
many
courts
who
have
talked
about
this,
and
they
said,
well,
in
theory,
asbestosis
is
dose-related.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes,
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
right.
they
had
the
burden
and
they
simply
didn't
meet
their
burden.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
but
it's
quite--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
your
honor,
no,
they
have
to
as
a
matter
of
law,
right,
proffer
some
kind,
and
here
there's
absolutely
nothing--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--there
was
some
evidence--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--there's
some
evidence
as
to
that,
but
in
fact
if
you
can
look
to
their
instruction
they
don't
even
say
what...
that
time
is
the
relevant
factor,
and
i
think
the
evidence
at
trial
shows
that
time
is
not
even
close
to
establishing
what
the
dose
relationship
would
be.
this
is
very
complicated.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
thank
you.
