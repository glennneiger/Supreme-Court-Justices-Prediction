justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
phillips,
did
the
defendant
attempt
to
test
this
by
seeking
a
special
verdict
so
that
the
damages
could
be
broken
down
by
the
jury?
this
was
a
general
verdict,
so
we
don't
know
how
much
they
gave
for
anything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
could
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
they
could
have...
if
they
tested
this,
isolated
this,
and
then
we'd
know
how
much
was
actually
allocated,
whether
it
was
as
he
initially
said
the
primary,
or
whether
it
was
a
lesser
thing.
we
just
don't
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
cause
in
whole
or
in
part?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
could
be
read
to
say
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
really
a
question
of
who
should
bear
the
burden
of
bringing
in
those
other
people.
if
it's
joint
and
several,
you
could
join
other
people.
on
your
view,
you
say
to
the
plaintiff,
"unless,
plaintiff,
you
bring
in
all
these
other
people,
you
can
only
get
a
small
piece
from
any
particular
one.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
both
of
those
cases
were
a
self-standing
claim
of
emotional
distress.
it
wasn't
pinned
to
any
existing
injuries.
here,
the
difference,
and
at
least
as
portrayed
by
the
judge
who
made
it
part
of
pain
and
suffering,
is
you
do
have
an
injury,
you
have
the
asbestosis,
and
one
of
the
elements
of
damages
is
pain
and
suffering,
and
this
is
included
in
pain
and
suffering.
at
least
that's
the
way
the
judge
saw
it,
as
distinguished
from
buckley
and
gottshall,
which
were
self-standing
claims
of
emotional
distress
not
tied
to
any
preexisting
injury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
doesn't
it
matter
what
form...
i'm
familiar
with
one
of
those
cases,
and
that
was
the
question--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--when
does
the
statute
of
limitations
start
to
run
when
you
get
the
virulent
form
of
cancer?
does
it
begin
to
run
when
you
got
the
asbestosis,
because
that
should
have
tipped
you
off
and
you
should
have
sued
then?
the
answer
in
that
context,
and
there
are
many
courts
that
say
that
cancer
is
a
separate
claim,
is
not
necessarily
what
it
should
be
in
this
context.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
in
your
brief
that
it's
a
question
of
not
whether,
but
when,
because
when
you
get
cancer,
if
you
get
cancer,
you
get
the
damages
for
past,
present,
and
future
pain
and
suffering,
but
that's
not
quite
right,
is
it,
because
you
are
leaving
out
the
category
of
person
who
has
asbestosis
and
never
gets
cancer,
which
will
be
most
of
these
people?
those
people...
for
them,
it
is
a
question
of
whether,
not
when,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they
never...
they
can
never
collect
for
this
alleged
fear.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lazarus--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lazarus,
may
i
ask
you
on
that
point...
let's
for
a
moment
not
think
of
ourselves
as
lawyers.
here
are
two
people,
the
person
in
buckley,
the
snowman,
and
the
person
who
has
asbestosis,
both
of
those
people
may
have
a
real
fear
of
cancer,
and
we
may
find
them
credible
witnesses.
i
thought
in
the
buckley
situation
that
one
concern
is,
it's
too
easy
to
make
this
up,
and
for
some
people
facing
that
risk,
they'll
say,
"well,
yeah,
i
might
be
run
over
tomorrow,
it
doesn't
bother
me.
"
isn't
the
real
problem
that
the
fear
of
something,
when
that
fear
doesn't
have
the
physical
manifestation,
that
these
things
are
too
easy
to
make
up,
too
uncontrollable,
and
i
frankly
can't
see
the
difference
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
sufferer
between
the
person
in
buckley
and
the
person
here.
the
person
in
the
grand
central
station
case
could
say
"i
had
the
same
fear
that
that
person
has.
"
"he
hasn't
proved
his
fear
any
more
than
i
proved
mine,
why
should
he
recover
and
not
me?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what's
more
legitimate...
and
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
conditions
under
which
the
people
worked
in
grand
central
station...
that
they
were
exposed
to
asbestos,
that
they
should
have
been
told
much
earlier
about
their
exposure,
and
they
must
have
been
very
angry
that
they
weren't
told.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
there--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
wouldn't
that
be
error?
i
mean,
the
instruction
does
say
that
a
plaintiff
who's
demonstrated
that
he's
developed
a
reasonable
fear
of
cancer
related
to
the
proven
physical
injury
from
asbestos
can
be
compensated
for
the
fear.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
so...
in
the
same
instruction
the
court
says,
you
cannot
award
damages
for
cancer
or
any
increased
risk
of
cancer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what's
disproportionate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
you
take
one
plaintiff
who
is
very
nervous,
very
apprehensive,
and
for
that
person
this
increased
risk--
--right.
--is
going
to
be
much
more
aggravated.
then,
take
another
person
who's
subject
to
the
same
risk,
but
has
a
thicker
skin
and
says,
"well,
i'll
take
it
in
stride.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
the
person
gets
cancer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
a
person
gets
cancer...
and
i
take
it
you
agree
with
the
government
that
such
a
person
could
get
past,
present,
and
future
anxiety
as
part
of
pain
and
suffering,
but
suppose
that
person
had
earlier
had
asbestos,
and
then
brings
his
claim
for
lung
cancer,
couldn't...
if
you
prevail
today...
the
defendant
say
"well,
at
least
for
the
apprehension
in
the
past,
you
know
you're
precluded,
because
you
could
have
brought
that
claim
when
you
got
asbestosis?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
be
claim
preclusion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
say
you
had
the
burden.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
arises
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
in
my
day
called
the
fela,
a
1908
law
still
enforced
requiring
railroads
to
compensate
their
workers
for
injuries
caused
in
whole
or
in
part
by
the
railroads
negligence.
the
six
plaintiffs
in
the
suit
before
us,
respondent's
here,
are
former
employees
of
the
norfolk
and
western
railway
company;
each
suffers
from
asbestosis,
a
chronic
disease
caused
by
prolonged
exposure
to
the
toxic
substance
asbestos.
we
resolved
in
today's
decision,
two
questions
important
to
the
application
of
the
fela:
first,
when
a
worker
is
afflicted
with
asbestosis
caused
by
exposure
to
asbestos
while
employed
by
the
railroad,
the
worker
can
recover
for
asbestosis-related
pain
and
suffering.
the
question
we
address
is
whether
that
recovery
may
include
damages
for
fear
of
developing
an
asbestos-induced
cancer.
the
second
question
concerns
apportionment
of
damages
when
others
not
before
the
court
may
have
contributed
to
the
worker's
injury,
for
example,
prior
or
subsequent
employer
or
asbestos
manufacturers
or
suppliers.
is
the
railroad
answerable
to
the
employee
or
is
it
immediately
entitled
to
a
division
of
damages
limiting
its
liability
to
a
proportionate
share?
the
west
virginia
state
court
in
which
this
case
was
tried
and
initially
reviewed
ruled
for
the
workers
and
against
the
railroad
on
both
questions
as
do
we.
responding
to
the
first
question,
we
followed
the
path
marked
by
our
prior
decisions
which
in
turn
rest
on
common
law
principles
and
developments.
a
worker
exposed
to
asbestos
remains
symptom
free,
we
recently
held,
may
not
recover
damages
for
apprehending
that
he
may
someday
suffer
an
asbestos-induced
disease,
but
we
have
distinguished
from
fear
or
anxiety
not
tied
to
a
present
affliction,
another
category
that
is
tied,
fear
or
anxiety
about
future
harm
stemming
from
an
already
manifested
physical
injury
or
illness.
emotional
distress,
falling
in
that
latter
category
we
have
observed
it
is
compensible.
adhering
to
that
framework
we
hold
that
a
railroad
worker
suffering
from
asbestosis
can
recover
for
the
heightened
anxiety
he
experiences
because
of
his
vulnerability
to
a
more
dread
disease
but
it
will
not
suffice
precaution
merely
to
allege
such
distress
that
it
is
the
complainant's
burden
to
prove
that
the
asserted
fear
is
genuine
and
serious.
on
this
issue,
question
1,
the
court
is
not
unanimous.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
on
question
1
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
o'connor,
and
justice
breyer;
justice
breyer
has
also
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion
on
the
first
question.
on
question
2,
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
the
fela's
expressed
terms
allow
a
worker
to
recover
in
full
from
a
railroad
whose
negligence
alone
or
jointly
caused
an
injury.
the
fela's
text
moreover
is
reenforced
by
the
act's
overarching
purpose
and
by
consistent
judicial
applications.
the
statute
was
designed
to
shift
part
of
the
human
cost
of
railroading
from
employees
to
their
employer.
it
accords
with
that
design
to
require
the
employer
to
bear
the
burden
first
to
identify
other
responsible
parties
and
then
to
demonstrate
in
the
claim
for
contribution
that
some
of
the
cost
of
the
injury
should
be
spread
to
them.
