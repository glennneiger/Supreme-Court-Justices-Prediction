how
do
we
know
that?
i
mean,
i
notice
that
the
awards
there
seem
to
grow
with
age,
and
they
don't
seem
to
vary
depending
upon
smoking.
i
mean,
they're
inversely
related
to
age,
they
don't
seem
to
be
affected
by
smoking,
and
that
suggested
to
me
that
maybe
it
didn't
play
a
major
part,
this
fear
of
cancer.
how
do
we
know
that
it
played
a
major
part?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
it?
why...
maybe
they're
entitled
to
some
fear.
a
person
who
has
no
problem
in
the
world
has
a
1
in
4
chance
of
dying
in
cancer.
a
person
who's
subjected
to
asbestos
may
have
a
1
in
3
chance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
gives
them
entitlement
to
some
little
amount,
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
that
is
true,
what
you
say,
but
i
felt
the
question
was
open,
and
the
reason
that
i
thought
it
was
open
is
because
probably
i
once
learned
that
this
area
of
the
law
arose
out
of
an
english
case
where
somebody
is
watching
a
coffin
fall
off
in
an
accident,
and
the
rule
was
that
you
can't
recover
unless
something
hits
you,
but
what
you
were
recovering
for
was
the
coffin,
and
the
pain
and
suffering
that
a
family
member
would
feel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
immediate,
directly
related
to
the
accident,
and
quite
clearly
present
and
measurable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
not
immediate.
it's
a
fear
of
something
way
in
the
future.
it
is
very
hard
to
determine
whether
it
is
right
or
wrong,
and
it
has
no
causal
relation
to
the
physical
thing,
and
therefore,
i
thought
that
it's
open.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
want
to
say...
i'll
look
it
up,
but
if
you
were
to
say
it's
absolutely
not
open,
i
mean,
they
have,
you
know,
lots
of
briefs
where
they've
made
a
pretty
good
case
it's
at
least
open.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
mean,
you
saw
their
reply
brief,
and
their
reply
briefed
that
is
that
the
underlined
phrase...
the
italicized
phrase...
or
from
conduct
which
causes
it,
is
not
really
what's
at
issue.
what's
issue
are
the
words
in
that
called
"emotional
disturbance",
and
the
question
is,
what
kind
of
emotional--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--disturbance,
and
i
think
that
their
argument
is,
which
if
i
put
numbers
on
it
is,
each
one
of
us
in
this
room
has
1
in
4
chance
that
we
will
die
of
cancer,
and
the
difference
between
us
and
a
plaintiff
in
this
case
is
that
he
has
a
1
in...
wait.
we
have
1
in
5...
1
in
5,
and
he
has
1
in
4,
and
what
they're
saying
is,
i
think,
that
the
difference
between
a
1
in
5
chance
of
dying
of
cancer,
and
a
difference
of
1
in
4
chance
of
dying
in
cancer
is
intangible...
hard
to
measure
in
anyone's
psychology.
nobody
really
makes
such
distinctions
rational,
and
therefore
don't
open
this
up
to
juries
awarding
large
amounts
of
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
don't
think
their
evidence
is
relevant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
say
this
is
a
question
that's
being
put
to
us
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
is
up
to
us
to
look
at
the
numbers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
reaching
those
numbers
i
gave
you,
i've
assumed
everything
in
your
favor.
that
is,
it's
really...
because
you're
a
railroad
and
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
involved
in
the
studies
you
cite...
it
could
be
a
lot
less
than
i
say,
but
it's
not
going
to
be
more.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
you're
right,
and
the
dog
bite
cases
support
you,
and
the
radiation
cases
support
you,
and
if
it's
cut-and-dried,
as
you
say,
then
you
win.
but
if,
when
i
look
at
all
this
stuff
again,
and
i
come
to
the
conclusion...
if
i
were
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
wasn't
cut-and-dried,
then
i'm
much
more
at
sea,
and
i
want
you
to
see
why.
one
was
the
reason
i
gave,
which
is
the
risk
problems,
and
the
other,
which
is
driving
that,
and
i'd
just
like
you
to
comment
on
this,
is...
is
my
concern
that
if
we
begin
to
compensate
people
for
fear
of
small
changes
in
risks
when
the
law
doesn't...
is
open
on
the
point...
what
will
happen
in
the
asbestos
cases,
and
that
was
their
initial
point,
is
that
we
will...
there's
$200
billion
at
stake,
and
the
fund
will
run
dry.
when
the
people
who
really
get
the
cancer
come
into
court,
the
cupboard
will
be
bare,
and
i
think
that's
a
serious
policy
problem,
and
it's
worrying
me
quite
a
lot,
and
that's
why
i
keep
coming
back
to
the
open
nature
of
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
say,
is
there
any
answer--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--other
than
the
law
that
is
clear--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
