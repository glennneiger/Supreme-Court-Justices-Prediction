mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1997,
this
court
recognized
that
there
is
an
asbestos
litigation
crisis
confronting
the
nation,
and
nothing
in
the
last
five
years
has
been...
done
anything
other
than
to
show
that
that
crisis
is
more
acute
now
than
at
any
other
time
in
our
history.
the
rand
corporation
in
a
report
just
two
months
ago
concluded
that
there
are
now
6,000
defendants
confronted
with
asbestos
litigation
claims,
that
the
estimated
value
of
those
claims
in
litigation
costs
exceeds
$200
billion.
the
six
plaintiffs
who
are
involved
in
this
case,
the
respondents
here
today,
are
emblematic
of
at
least
a
fundamental
element
of
the
problem
that
confronts
asbestos
litigation.
each
of
them
received
close
to,
and
in
some
instances
more
than
a
million
dollars
in
compensatory
damages
for
claims
of
asbestosis.
the
basis
for
their
claim,
the
primary
basis
for
their
claim
was
that
they
confronted
a
fear
of
cancer.
asbestosis
does
not
convert
into
cancer--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there
is
a
legal
answer
and
there
is
a
factual
answer.
the
legal
answer
is
that
you
have
to
assume
it
because
the
jury
was
instructed
to
include
it
as
an
element,
and
under
west
virginia
law,
it
is
absolutely
settled
and
respondents
don't
contest
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
all
suffered
asbestosis,
and
they
all
suffered
some
physical
elements
of
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know
that
it's
not
the
primary
ingredient,
justice
stevens.
what
i
do
know
is
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
can't
ignore
the
fact
that
the...
that
fear
of
cancer
was
put
before
the
jury
as
a
significant
component
of
the
plaintiff's
case
in
chief,
that
the
jury
was
instructed
to
include
that,
and
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
the
record
supports
it
in
the
sense
that
we
know
that
these
are
asbestosis
claims
that
even
the
respondents'
expert
testified
were
mild,
for
the
most
part.
one
or
two
differences
about
that,
but
these
are
still
relatively
mild
asbestosis
claims,
and
mild
asbestosis
claims
do
not
typically
generate
million-dollar
damages
awards--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--particularly
where
there's
no
cost
of
medical
care
as
part
of
the
component.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
the
defendants
didn't...
the
defendant
did
not
ask
for
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
what
the
defendant
did
ask
for,
justice
ginsburg,
was
to
have
fear-of
damages
eliminated
as
a
component
of
the
case
in
a
case
like
this--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--oh,
and
that's
because
it's
the
plaintiff's
burden.
if
they
didn't
want
to
have...
if
they
didn't
want
to
take
the
risk
of
a
general
verdict
being
set
aside
because
there's
an
element
of
damages
that's
included
that
the
court
ultimately
decides
should
be
excluded
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
then
bear
the
risk
and
the
burden
of
having
the
case
sent
back
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
problem's
easy
to
identify,
that
is
that
if
the
instruction
is
that
everyone
who
suffers
a
diagnosed
case
of
asbestosis
is
entitled
to
go
to
the
jury
on
fear
of
cancer
claims,
then
the
amount
of
damages
that
will
be
generated
as
a
consequence
of
that
will
run
completely
out
of
sync--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--with
the
damages
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
this
court--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
breyer,
you
said,
or
the
court
said
in
buckley
that
you
don't
analyze
these
issues
case
by
case.
what
you
have
to
do
is
make
a
judgment
about
the
category
of
cases
that's
based
on
the
policies
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act,
and
the
federal--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it's
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
and
it
is
also
clear
under
west
virginia
law
that
if
two
theories
are
put
before
the
jury
with
respect
to
damages
and
one
of
them
is
impermissible,
the
answer
is
you
strike
down
and
you
get
a
new
trial
on
damages,
so
that's...
that's
clear.
and
i
don't...
i
don't
hear
the
respondents
as
arguing
anything
to
the
contrary.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
this
court
said
in
gottshall
that
pain
and
suffering
damages
are
describable
as
sensations
stemming
directly
from
a
physical
injury
or
condition.
the
physical
injury
that...
that's
identified
here
is
asbestosis,
and
to
be
sure,
the
pain
and
suffering
an
asbestotic
would
be
allowed
to
recover
for
might
be
a
fear
of
shortness
of
breath
or
other
symptoms
that
arise
out
of
asbestosis,
but
the
notion
that
cancer
that
doesn't
exist
currently,
may
never
take
place,
stems
from
the
existence
of
asbestosis
is
not
a
fair
application
of
that
rule
of
law,
particularly
when
there
is
no
evidence,
and
again,
i
don't
think
respondents
challenge
this,
that
asbestosis
does
not
cause
cancer,
it
does
not
lead
to
cancer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
all...
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
it's
the
respondents
who
are
asking
you
to
do
something
different
with
a
pain
and
suffering
case,
and
actually
i'm
not
even
sure
that's
a
fair
way
to
characterize
the
respondents'
argument.
i
don't
understand
them
to
be
arguing
that
this
is
a
classic
pain
and
suffering--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
and
my
argument
is,
this
is
not
under
any
circumstances
the
kind
of
pain
and
suffering
that
we
traditionally
think
of.
it's
not
something
that
emanates
directly
out
of
the
existing
injury.
second,
it's
not
negligent
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
and
it's
not
emotional
injury
as
a
component
of
a
negligence
claim.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
it
was--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
wasn't
clear
exactly
what
it
was
until
the
jury...
until
we
got
to
the
jury
instructions.
at
that
point,
the
trial
judge
did
say,
i
view
these
as
pain
and
suffering.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
except
that
the
traditional
standard
for
pain
and
suffering
doesn't
permit
the
kind
of
disconnect
between
the
fear
of
cancer
that
you're
talking
about
here
and
asbestosis.
you
normally
associate
pain
and
suffering
as
sensations
that
emanate
directly
from
the
injury
itself,
and
fear
of
cancer
doesn't
emanate
at
all
from
asbestosis.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
fright
from
asbestosis--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
be
sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it's
interesting,
you
know,
the
testimony
itself
was
simply,
do
you
have
a
fear
because
of
exposure
to
asbestos
now
that
you
have
asbestosis.
they
didn't
even
ask
the
question
whether
the
fear
arises
out
of
the
asbestosis.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
our
argument,
justice
souter,
was
that
fear
of
cancer
is
too
unrelated,
as
a
matter
of
law,
to
be
an
element
of
pain
and
suffering.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--buckley,
frankly,
is
as
close
to
anything
on
that
score,
because
buckley
says
even
if
you
accept
as
an
article
of
faith,
as
i
think
the
court
did,
that
each
of
those
individuals
who'd
been
exposed
to
asbestos
felt
that
he
or
she
would
be
more
seriously
at
risk--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
none
of
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
justice
souter.
in
the
first
place,
the...
there
is
no
strong
common
law
doctrine
that
says
that
those...
that
that
kind
of
a
disconnect
between
the
damages
is
a
core
element
of
what
the
common
law
routinely
grants
for--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
core
of
the
pain
and
suffering...
the
pain
and
suffering
theory
is
that
it
is
a
fright
that
emanates
directly
out
of
the
particular
condition
you
have,
which
is
asbestosis.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
even
if
you
accept
that
premise,
justice
souter,
you
still
have
to
confront
the
overall
policies
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act,
and
the
question
of
whether
not
allowing
a
recovery
that
might
otherwise
be
legitimate...
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
court
said--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't
think
the
common
law
clearly
allows
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--there
are
lower
court...
we
cite
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
decisions,
the
eleventh
circuit
decisions...
there
are
decisions
out
there
that
have
said
we're
not
going
to
allow
fear
of
cancer
in
cases
involving
asbestosis,
but
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i'm
not
asking
you
to...
i
don't
think
the
answer
to
this
case
resides
in
the
common
law,
because
i
think
the
common
law
is
essentially
a
muddle.
there
are
cases
on
both
sides.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely,
justice
o'connor,
and
the
reason
to
do
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i...
i...
i'll
concede
that
it
is
a
minority
view
in
the
sense
that
there
are
maybe
five
cases
on
one
side--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
three
or
four
on
the
other.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
this
is
not
an
area
that's
been
litigated
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
say
where
the
trends
are.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
well,
i've
only
got
two
or
three
cases
that
identify
it
in
the
context...
the
way
you
just
did,
justice
o'connor,
and
my
colleague
on
the
other
side
will
identify
four
or
five
cases
that
don't
impose
that
requirement,
but
what
remains
absolutely
critical
in
the
analysis
of
this
case,
i
think,
is
the
core
policy
that
this
court
identified
in
gottshall
and
in
buckley
that
says
if
you
don't
have
a
clear
answer
from
the
common
law,
you
have
to
see
whether
or
not
this
particular
damages
remedy
creates
the
possibility
of
unpredictable
and
unlimited
damages,
and
that's
the
reason
why
the
court
needs
to
adopt
a
more
restrictive
view
of
the
standard
to
be
applied
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
that
may
not
be
the
rule
that
would
be
required
as
a
matter
of
common
law
in
any
particular
state,
but
under
fela,
the
notion
that
you're
going
to
create
unlimited
liability
in
circumstances
in
which
the
plaintiffs
are
allowed
significantly
reduced
requirements
in
order
to
prove
a
basis
for
their
claim
suggests
that
this
court
has
consistently
taken
the
position
that
it
must
cut
back
and
not
allow
on
a
category
basis...
on
a
categorical
basis...
not
allow
damages
to
extend
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
i
don't
think
so--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
case.
i
think
once
you
get
past
more
likely
than
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
when
you
get
past
more
likely
than
not
that
you
will
incur
cancer,
there
is
a
risk,
then
at
that
point...
but
remember,
the
flip
side
of
this
is
the
two-disease
rule,
and
that's
an
important
element
in
how
the
court
ought
to
analyze
this
problem,
because
not
only...
by
allowing
fear
of
cancer
damages
now,
you
essentially
say
to
the
world,
the
sky
is
the
limit,
inconsistent
with
what
the
court
said
in
gottshall
and
buckley.
the
flip
side
is,
if
you
don't
allow
the
fear
of
cancer
damages
now,
but
allow
fear
of...
but
allow
the
plaintiff
to
come
back
after
he
or
she
contracts
cancer
and
allows
as
a
part
of
that
recovery
for
fear
of
cancer,
then
the
people
who
are
most
seriously
injured
are
made
whole
at
the
appropriate
time
in
the
appropriate
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
apportionment.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
quick
answer
on
apportionment
is
that
in
1908,
it
was
absolutely
clear
there
was
several
liability.
you're
only
liable
for
the
injuries
you
cause.
that's
embodied,
i
think,
in
the
statutory
language
that
says
that
the
railroad
is
responsible
for
the
injuries
while
employed.
that
language
has
been
interpreted
as
recognizing
we
only
pay
for
the
things
that
we
cause.
the
third
restatement--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
that
goes
to
the
question
of
what
you
need
to
show
a
jury
in
order
to
get
a
negligence
claim
to
the
jury
in
the
first
instance.
it
doesn't
say
you're...
you're
liable
for
the
entirety
of
the
damages
in
whole
or
in
part.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
could,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
most
natural
reading
of
that
particular
language,
and
i
don't
think
it's
an
appropriate
one
where
the
policies
in
1908,
and
the
policies
of
the
law
under
the
third
restatement
quite
clearly
say
that
you
should
apportion,
because
that
is
the
fair
way
in
order
to
ensure
that
a
defendant
is
not...
does
not...
is
not
forced
to
overcompensate.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
and
i
think
the
statute
and
the
existing
common
law
clearly
suggest
that
the
right
answer
is
that
because
you've
reduced
the
burden
of
the
plaintiff
in
order
to
get
into
court
and
to
be
able
to
make
a
case,
the
quid
pro
quo
for
that
ought
to
be
that
you
only
hold
the
railroad
liable
for
the
amount
of
the
injury
it
caused,
and
here
it
is
not
contested
that...
and
mr.
butler's
case
is
the
prototype
example
of
it...
he
had
three
months
of
exposure
when
he
was
with
norfolk
&
western,
he
had
30
years
of
exposure
with
others.
that
is
a
reasonable
basis
on
which
to
apportion
for
cause,
and
that...
and
no
one
has
contested
that.
i'd
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
be
absolutely
clear
about
the
apportionment
in
this
case.
we
put
in
an
instruction
on
apportionment
based
on
a
reasonable
basis
following
justice
kennedy's
analysis
of
the
law,
which
says
if
there's
a
reasonable
basis
to
apportion,
you
do
that.
the
trial
judge
did
not
reject
that
on
the
basis
of
insufficient
evidence.
what
he
said
at
page
179,
volume
9
of
the
transcript
is,
if
you've
got
a
joint
tort-feasor,
that
tort-feasor
is
liable
for
all
of
the
injuries.
he
said
it
as
a
matter
of
law.
it's
joint
and
several
liability.
there
is
no
apportionment.
that's
the
ruling
we
challenged.
that's
the
legal
issue
before
this
court.
the
second
question,
then,
with
your
leave,
is
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
dean
prosser
said
from
day
one
it's
always
going
to
be
difficult
to
apportion,
but
that's
no
reason
not
to
have
the
jury
undertake
to
apportion.
there
are
lots
of
decisions
that
juries
make
that
are
very
hard
to
make,
but
the
better
rule
is
to
apportion,
because
that's
the
fair
outcome
that
will
arise
in
these
cases.
with
respect
to
the
fear
of
cancer
damages,
the
key
to
this
case,
it
seems
to
me,
is
just
how
big
a
gatekeeper
function
the
fact
of
asbestosis
can
be,
and
my...
the
argument
is,
asbestosis
is
extraordinarily
easy
to
diagnose.
there
are
currently
5,500
cases
under
fela
in
west
virginia.
every
single
one
of
them
involves
a
claim
of
asbestosis.
every
single
one
of
them
will
be
supported
by
an
expert.
what
you
get
is,
that's
not
a
gatekeeper.
those
cases
are
going
to
come
in,
and
then
you're
going
to
have
exactly
the
kinds
of
evidence
you
had
in
this
case,
i'm
afraid
of
cancer,
give
me
whatever
you
think
is
the
right
number.
that
is
the
essence
of
unpredictable
and
unlimited
damages.
this
court
declined
to
allow
that
under
fela
in
buckley.
it
should
decline
to
allow
that
under
fela
in
this
case
as
well.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i'll
reserve--
