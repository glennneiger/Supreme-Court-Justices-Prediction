--so
the
fear
that
you're
going
to
die
of
cancer
is
compensable
before
you
get
it,
and
it's
compensable
again
after
you
get
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
i
thought
that
the...
you
can
recover
for
the
fear
in
both
cases
under
your
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
would
be
a
discount.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
then
your
first
answer
was,
you
changed
it
from--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--do
we
have
cases
in
the
law
where
you
give
discounts
for
the
first
verdict?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
indicates
that
maybe
the
recovery
now
is
problematic.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let
me
ask
one...
please.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
testimony
here
that
plaintiff
a
had
heavy,
or
severe
asbestosis
and
plaintiff
b
had
mild,
and
was
it
based
on
any
lung
x-rays
to
show
that
this
person's
very
badly
infected
and
the
other
wasn't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
and
since
that's
dependent
on
dosage,
why
isn't
this
a
case
in
which
we
can
apportion
causation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
is
it
a
principle
of
tort
law
that
if
causation
can
be
apportioned,
that
the
injury
is...
that
there
is
then
several
liability
on
that
tort--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
since
asbestosis
is
peculiarly
related
to
dosage
and
exposure,
why
isn't
that
a
proper
ground
for
apportionment
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
was
that
relevant
if
there's
joint
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
argument
goes
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
they
offered,
rather
than
to
the...
your
legal
position.
i
may
be
missing
something.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
they
did
proffer...
if
i
remember
it,
they
did
proffer
evidence
as
to
the
time
that
these
people
worked
in
other
areas
where
they
were
exposed
to
asbestos,
didn't
they?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
saying
that's
not
enough.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
should
we
adopt
your
position
if
it's
as
difficult
to
show
this
separate
causation
as
your
brother
argues?
