mr....
mr.
waxman,
is
what
you're
saying
essentially
there
is
a
federal
claim
or
there
is
no
claim?
certainly
the
plaintiff
doesn't
want
there
to
be
no
claim.
if
there
is
a
claim,
it
is
necessarily
federal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
what
makes
it
removable.
it
is
treated
as
though
it
were
well
pleaded,
when,
in
fact,
it's
badly
pleaded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
they
had--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
they
had
pled
it
correctly,
they
could
still
be
in
state
court,
but
the
defendant
could
remove.
in
other
words,
this
is
not...
although
it's
a
federal
claim...
it
arises
only
under
federal
law...
it
could
be
brought
in
state
court
or
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
can
3...
301
suits.
the
two
cases
that
we
have
so
far
where
we
have
recognized
that
there
is
only
a
federal
cause
of
action,
that
cause
of
action
could
have
been
brought
just
as
well
in
state
court,
but
it's
up
to
the
defendant
to
remove
it.
so
we're
not
talking
about
an
exclusive
federal
forum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
were
related
claims
here
that
were
strictly
state
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
fell
into--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
they'd
come
up
under
1367.
they
would
travel
with
the
13--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
you
had
this
same
complaint
and
it
didn't
have
the
usury
claim
and
it
just
had
those
state
law
claims,
then
there's
nothing
removable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
one
was
a
state
rate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
not
a
federal
defense,
mr....
mr.
clark.
this
is
like...
suppose
you
have
a
case
in
state
court
and
the
plaintiff
says,
we're
both
from
the
state
of
alabama.
defendant
removes
it,
says,
i
was
from...
i
am,
was
from
georgia.
now,
doesn't
the
defendant
have
a
right
to
remove
that
case
even
though
plaintiff
pled
it
as
though
it
were
a
case
that
could
be
only
in
state
court?
said
we're
both
from--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--plaintiff
is
from
alabama.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
plaintiff
says
defendant
is
from
alabama.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
defendant
removes
because
defendant
is,
in
fact,
from
georgia.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
allowed
to
choose
a
theory
that
doesn't
exist.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
notion
is
that
there
simply
is
no
claim
under
state
law
for
usury
against
a
national
bank.
it
doesn't
exist.
no
such
claim.
if
the
plaintiff
chose
to
stand
on
such
a
claim,
it
would
have
to
be
dismissed
because
the
only
exclusive
claim
for
relief...
although
it
can
be
brought
in
state
or
federal
court,
the
exclusive
claim
is
one
under
federal
law.
that's
the
argument
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
of
course.
and
there's
one
case...
i
was
surprised
you
didn't
cite
it
in
your
brief.
it's
very...
makes
that
point
very
nicely.
the
rivet
case
against
regions
bank,
which
was
featured
on
the
other
side...
you
didn't
mention
it
at
all
in
your
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that...
that
distinguishes
between
a
claim
for
relief
and
a
defense.
and
that
case
involved
a
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
defense
of
preclusion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
problem
with
it
is
your
complaint
isn't
well-pleaded
if
the
only
source
of
law
is
federal,
which
you
conceded
on
your
brief
and
again
here.
there
is
no
well-pleaded
alabama
claim
because
the
alabama
claim
or
the
state
law
claim
doesn't
exist.
the
only
claim
that
exists
against
a
national
bank
for
usury
is
a
federal
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
face
of
a
well-pleaded
complaint.
and
there's
a
difference
between
preemption
as
a
defense
to
a
claim
that
is
well
pleaded
and
here
where
you
have
badly
pleaded
a
complaint
that
can
arise
only
under
federal
law
that
simply
can't
arise
under
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
have
one
simple
question.
has
congress
provided
for
exclusive
federal
law
to
govern
this
claim?
that's
not
a
complicated
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
clark,
i'm...
can
we
go
back
to...
you
just
cited
gully
and
maybe
i
have
it
wrong,
but
i
thought
that
that
was
a
suit
to
collect
a
state
tax
under
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
the
source
of
law
that
was
applied
to
the
private
actor
was
state
law,
the
state
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
here,
the
source
of
law
that
would
be
applied
is
federal
law,
not
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
may
i
understand
this
further
point?
what
justice
scalia's
described
seems
to
me
quite
common.
you
have
state
human
rights
laws.
you
have
federal
human
rights
laws.
the
same
facts
that
i
was
discriminated
against.
if
i
make
my
choice
that
i
want
to
bring
it
under,
say,
new
york
law
rather
than
title
vii,
that's
my
prerogative.
and
the
defendant
certainly
can't
remove
that
case
by
saying,
well,
you
could
have
pleaded
those
same
facts
as
a
title
vii
case.
quite
different.
that's
where
there's
concurrent
lawmaking
authority,
both
state
and
federal.
here
the
argument
is
there
is
no
state
lawmaking
authority.
there
is
no
parallel
source
of
law,
state
and
federal,
and
that's
what
makes
it
different
from
the
ordinary
case
where
you
plead
the
facts
and
they
would
state
a
claim
under
either
state
law
or
federal
law.
the
pleader
has
her
choice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
usury.
i
mean,
you...
it's
a
question
of
how
you
characterize
this,
but
i
think
you
agree
that
on
the
question
of
usury,
the
federal
legislation
is
conclusive
and
it
was
done,
indeed,
for
the
very
purpose
of
having
national
banks
escape
from
whatever
jealous,
mean
legislation
the
state
might
pass.
so
the
only
law...
i
mean,
the
choice
would
be
if
you
want
to
say,
yes,
i
want
to
stick
with
alabama
law,
no
federal
85,
86
for
me,
that
case
must
get
dismissed.
you
can't
get
past
the
door
because
there
is
no
such
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
a
plaintiff
want
to
bring
a...
a
suit
that
inevitably
must
be
dismissed?
