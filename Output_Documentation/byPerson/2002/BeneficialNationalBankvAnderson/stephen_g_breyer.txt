justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
answer
is
yes,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question...
can
i
ask
you
a
standard
on
this?
i
mean,
i
thought
the
standard
is
to
ask
this
question.
is
this...
i.e.,
the
state
claim...
the
kind
of
claim
in
respect
to
which
congress
intended
the
federal
action
to
be
the
exclusive
substitute
therefor?
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
you
can
remove
it
even
if
it
doesn't
state
a
federal
cause
of
action.
now,
have
i
got
it
right
what
your
argument
is
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean--
--is
that
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
if
i'm
right
or
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
i'm
not
asking
just
to
hear
my
standard.
i'm
asking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
right,
okay,
in
your
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
okay,
and
by
the
same
token,
if
justice
stevens'
question
had
been
asked
about
a
subject
that
is
not
under
the
banking
act
or
labor
management
reporting
or
that
part
of
erisa
which
has
been
held
to
be
complete
preemption,
i
take
it
your
answer
would
be
that
if
a...
a
claim
was
pleaded
that
omitted
one
element
of
the
federal
cause
of
action
in
the
state
court,
and
you
didn't
start
with
the
assumption
that
there
was
complete
preemption
for
extraneous
reasons,
it
wouldn't
be
removable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
we
don't
start
with
the
assumption
of
complete
preemption.
what
he
states
is,
in
fact,
a
federal
claim
but
for
one
element.
is
that
removable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
leaves
out
an
element.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
not
a
federal
claim.
he's
left
out
one
element.
would
that
be
removable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait.
don't
leave
that
point
because
you're...
you
win
if
you're
right
on
that.
i
mean,
you
win
if
your
particular
claim
is
not
preempted
by
this
federal
statute,
you
win...
and
they
admit
it...
if
this
particular
federal
statute
is
not
intended
by
congress
to
be
the
exclusive
vehicle
for
bringing
the
kind
of
claim
that
you
have
brought.
so
now,
explain
to
me.
you
just
said
it
isn't.
why
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
in
your
opinion,
is
the
state
cause
of
action
that
you
brought...
you
say
it
is
not
true
that
congress
intended
the
federal
cause
of
action
as
the
exclusive
vehicle,
excluding
your
kind
of
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
say
it
did.
you
say
it
didn't.
now,
all
i
want
to
hear
is
your
arguments
for
saying
it
didn't
because
they
pointed
to
a
lot
of
federal
cases
going
back
to
1886
which
say
usury
claims
are
to
be
brought
under
the
federal
statute.
the
state
power
in
respect
to
a
national
bank
has
no
power.
okay?
now,
your
reply
to
that
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
what
caterpillar
could
possibly
have
to
do
with
it
since
it
isn't
a
bank
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
asking
you
that.
i
asked
you
to
tell
me
about
banking
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
is
it
the
case
in
your
view...
you
concede
it.
you
seem
to
contest
it.
i'll
repeat
it
for
the
third
time.
is
it
the
case
that
this
federal
cause
of
action
is
intended
by
congress
as
the
exclusive
vehicle
excluding
your
state
cause
of
action
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
answer
to
my
question
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
well,
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
you
can't
make
the
argument
you
just
made.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you...
you
really
want...
you
conceded
you
have
no
state
claim.
it's
preempted
by
the
federal
statutes.
is
that
right?
is
that
what
you're
conceding?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
there
is
no
state
claim.
so
then
the
question
in
this
case
is
even
though
you
concede,
as
i
take
it
you
have...
i
don't
know
if
you
really
mean
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
but
i
take
it
you
just
did
concede
that
the
federal
cause
of
action
is
the
only
possible
cause
of
action
that
your
client
could
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
you
are
not
conceding--
--then
you
just
withdrew
your
concession.
[laughter]
--complete
preemption
as
opposed
to
ordinary
preemption.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
conceding
ordinary
preemption,
but
not
complete
preemption.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
it
probably
was--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
still
trying
to
get
back
to
my...
i'm
beginning
to
see
what
i
think
your
answer
is,
but
please
don't
agree
with
me
if
you
really
disagree.
all
right.
first,
if
i
were
to
ask
the
question,
is
there
federal
law
in
the
area?
yes.
ask
the
question,
does
federal
law
preempt
state
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
here.
yes,
well,
you'll
say
right
here,
but
wait.
so
you...
if
i
ask
this
question,
is
this
state...
federal
cause
of
action...
did
congress
intend
it
to
preempt
a
state
cause
of
action
substituting
the
federal
cause
of
action
therefor?
i
think
now
you're
prepared
to
say
the
answer
to
this
question
is
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
will
answer
the
following
question
no.
is
there
an
intent
here
by
congress
that
this
federal
cause
of
action
that
preempts
the
state
cause
of
action
by
substituting
an
exclusive
federal
remedy...
is
there
an
intent
of
congress
to
allow
removal
when
it's
pleaded?
the
answer
is
we
have
no
evidence
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
they're
saying
on
their
side...
and
now
this
is
exactly
the
issue
between
them
and
the
lower
courts.
and
indeed,
there's
language
that's
unclear
in
the
lower
cases...
is
that
we
need
evidence
of
that
latter
point.
that's
what
you're
saying.
and
they're
saying
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
saying,
look,
all
you
have
to
have
are
the
first
three
things
i
mentioned.
stop
after
you
decide
that
congress
has
created
a
federal
action
with
the
intent
that
it
provide
an
exclusive
substitute
for
this
state
action.
stop
there.
don't
ask
for
any
further
evidence
of
anything.
one,
because
you'll
never
get
it.
congress
never
thinks
of
this
sort
of
esoteric
issue.
and
second,
because
there's
just
no
reason.
now,
okay.
now
i
get
the...
the
clash,
and
now
i
can
get
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
it's
my
fault.
i
didn't
get
it.
