justice
john
paul
stevens
what
happens...
what
happens
if
the
cause
of
action
is
for
misrepresentation
under
state
law,
and
the
misrepresentation
is
that
the
interest
rate
was
lawful
and
the
plaintiff
alleges
it
was
unlawful
because
it
was
usurious?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in...
in
my...
would
this
removable?
this
is
the
only
thing
in
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
this
might
be
like
gully
in
that
it...
the...
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action
was
really
a
state
cause
of
action
even
though
it
involves
an
inquiry
into
what
the
federal
law--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
unlawful,
and
the
only
misrepresentation
is
it's
unlawful
and
it's
unlawful
allegedly
because
it's
usurious.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roberts,
can
i
go
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question?
i
wonder
if
you
really
meant
the
answer
you
gave.
assume
a
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
alleges
that
3
percent
is
usurious
as
a
matter
of
alabama
law,
and
under
federal
law
it
must
be
at
least
5
percent,
say.
as
i
understand
it,
that
would
be
removable
because
he's
making
a
usury
claim
and
would
be
dismissable,
that
is,
under
your...
your
theory
of
the
case.
but
i
thought
you
said
that
would
have
to
be
dismissed
in
state
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
fail...
you
failed
to
state
a
federal
claim,
but
you
do
state
an
alabama
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
federal
court
would
dismiss,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
my...
my
hypothetical.
it's
3
percent
and
the
federal
law
clearly
says
anything
under
5
percent
is
not
usurious.
what
happens
with
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i've
given
you
all
the
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
a
colorable
claim
or
isn't
it
when
it
doesn't
allege
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--percentage
rate
that's
usurious
under
federal
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
still
don't
understand
your
answer.
my...
my
hypothesis
is
the
federal
law
says
no
cause
of
action
unless
it's
over
5
percent.
he
pleads
3
percent
and
he...
and
he
says
this
violates
state
law.
he
says
that
and
the
defendant
comes
in
and
says,
well,
there's
no
state
law
cause
of
action.
it's
a
federal
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it's...
that
is
a
matter
of
state
law
in
usury
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
you
say
there
is
no
such
animal.
but
then
do
you
get
to
remove
it
or
don't
you?
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
remove
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
might
be
able
to
remove
it
because
he
doesn't
have
confidence
in
what
the
state
judge
will
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i...
i
still
don't
know
whether
you're
telling
me
yes
or
no
to
my
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i've
told
you
what
the
claim
is.
is
that
colorable
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
says
3
percent.
federal
law
is
5
percent,
and
alabama
says
i'll...
i'll
do
it
on
3
percent.
can
he
remove
it
or
not?
he...
i
would
think
he
could
remove
it
and
get
it
dismissed,
but
i'm
not
sure
you
agree
with
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
this
removal
statute
read?
justice
john
paul
stevens
arises
under
the
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
could
we
please
answer
justice
breyer's
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just--
--may
i
ask...
may
i
ask
this
one
question?
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
slight
difference
in
the
text
of
section
85
and
86.
and
section
85
reads
as
a
defense,
and
if
that's
all
there
were
here,
i
would
understand
your
argument
completely.
but
i
think
one
can
read
section
86
as
creating
an
affirmative
federal
cause
of
action,
and
one
can
argue
that
that's
the
only
cause
of
action
that
can
be
prosecuted.
now,
if
that's
true,
would
there
not
be...
would
it
not...
not...
would
you
not
have
to
say
then
that
the
affirmative
remedy
in...
under
the
federal
statute
is
exclusive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
only
that
there's
a
federal
remedy
provided,
but
it's
been
construed
to
be
the
exclusive
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
those
are
the
only
remedies
that
one
can
get.
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
that
distinguish
it
from
some
of
these
other
hypothetical
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
respondents
are
individual
taxpayers
who
pledge
their
anticipated
tax
refunds
to
secure
short-term
loans
from
petitioner,
a
national
bank
chartered
under
the
national
bank
act.
respondents
sued
the
bank
and
two
other
petitioners
in
an
alabama
state
court
claiming
that
the
interest
rates
on
their
loans
were
usurious.
petitioners
removed
the
case
to
the
federal
district
court
asserting
that
the
national
bank
act
provides
the
exclusive
cause
of
action
for
usury
against
the
national
bank
that
the
suit
therefore
arose
under
federal
law
and
thus
could
properly
be
removed
to
a
federal
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
held
this
removal
improper
because
it
could
not
find
clear
congressional
intent
to
permit
such
a
removal.
we
granted
certiorari
and
today
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
provides
that
we
examine
only
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
and
ignore
potential
federal
defenses.
thus,
as
a
general
rule,
a
complaint
will
not
be
removable
if
the
complaint
is
not
affirmatively
allege
a
federal
claim.
congress
has,
however,
created
limited
exceptions
to
this
general
rule.
in
cases
interpreting
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act,
we
found
that
congress
completely
preempted
any
state
cause
of
action
and
therefore
the
case
is
alleging
only
state
law
causes
of
action
for
certain
claims
were
nonetheless
properly
removable.
in
a
long
line
of
cases,
this
court
has
construed
the
national
bank
act
as
providing
the
exclusive
cause
of
action
for
claims
of
usury
against
the
national
bank.
consistent
with
this
interpretation,
we
find
that
congress
has
completely
preempted
such
claims
and
that
the
suit
was
therefore
properly
removable.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
joined.
