justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waxman,
normally
when
the
federal
government
creates
a
cause
of
action
that
preempts
state
causes
of
action,
it
attaches
an
element
to
that
cause
of
action
that
does
not
exist
under
some
of
the
state
causes
of
action.
let's
say,
it...
it
creates
a
cause
of
action
against
the
owners
and...
and
managers
of
nuclear
facilities,
but
the
cause
of
action
must
be
based
on
something
more
than
mere
negligence.
it
has
to
be
intentional
malfeasance
or
gross
negligence.
okay?
now,
what
if
somebody
comes
in
and
brings
a
cause
of
action
in
state
court,
alleging
mere
negligence
by
the
owners
of
the
nuclear
facility?
is
it
your
position
that
that
case
is
removable
even
though
it
wouldn't...
it
wouldn't
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
under...
under
federal
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--leaving...
in
my
hypothetical...
create
one--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
take
my
hypothetical.
what
do
you
do
in
my
hypothetical?
is
it
removable
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
or
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
hypothetical
is
you
plead
a
state
law
cause
of
action
that
does
not
claim
all
of
the
elements
which
are
necessary
for
the
federal
cause
of
action.
so
it's
clear
on
the
face
of
it
that
it
is
dismissable.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
very
strange
to
say
that
you
can
remove
something
that
on
its
face
does
not
constitute
a
federal
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
consequence
of
that
is
that
the
state
law
cause
of
action
must
be
dismissed
by
the
state
court
because
it's
preempted,
or
rather,
the
consequence
is
that
you
can
remove
into
federal
court
a
pleading
that
plainly
on
its
face
does
not...
does
not
claim
a
federal
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
seems
very
strange
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
we're...
we're
not
talking
about
what
happens
here.
but
i...
with
regard
to
the
general
principle
that
you
want
us
to
set
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
what's...
what
i'm
concerned
about.
is
it
that
all
cases
automatically
come,
or
is
it
only
those
that...
that
set
forth
a
federal
cause
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waxman,
one
thing
that
troubles
me
about...
about
the
proposal
that
you
make
and
that
the
government
makes
is
that
it
seems
to
me
in
the
lmra
case
that
established
this
principle
and
in
the
erisa
case,
which
is
the
only
other
case
that
has...
has
held
to
the
same
effect,
those
cases
refer
to
this
as
being
an
extraordinary,
an
unusual
event.
but
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
be
an
unusual
event
if
we
say
that
whenever
there
is
created
a
federal
cause
of
action,
and
at
the
same
time,
state
causes
of
action
are
preempted,
it
may
be
removed
to
federal
court.
i
don't
think
that
will
be
unusual
at
all--
and
i
sort
of
looked
upon
the...
the
labor
management
relations
act
case
as
really
sort
of
a...
a
platypus,
i
mean,
a
very
strange
case
in
which
the
courts
just
didn't
want
these
labor
things
to
go
into
state
courts
because
they
didn't
trust
state
courts.
and
so
they
said,
boy,
we're
going
to
have
federal
courts
create
this
whole
new
law
of...
of
contracting,
of
collective
bargaining.
that's
how
i
always
regarded
it.
and
now
you're
telling
me
it's
really
just
a
little
piece
of
a
much
broader
proposition
which
is
not
at
all...
not
at
all
narrow.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
why
didn't
we
express
this...
this
principle
before
instead
of...
instead
of
adhering
so
narrowly?
i
mean,
even
the
erisa
case,
it
didn't
express
this...
this
broad
theory.
it
says,
this
is...
this
is
very
much
like
the
section
301,
and
the
legislative
history
referred
specifically
to
301,
and
therefore
we
come
out
the
same
way.
pretty...
pretty
narrow.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
you
the
same
question
that
i
asked
mr.
waxman?
what
if...
what
if
the
pleading
makes
a
claim
of
usury,
but
it
does
not
contain
all
of
the
elements
necessary
to
make
out
a
federal
cause
of
action?
is
that
removable?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
colorable.
i
mean,
one
of
the
elements
is
just
not
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
claims
usury
when...
when
what
they
charged
was
3
percent
and
that
would
not
violate
the
federal
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
i
want
to
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we...
you're...
you're
asking
us
to
set
forth
a
new
general
proposition,
which
we
haven't
set
forth
before.
we've...
we've
treated
301
and
erisa
as...
as
distinctive
cases.
now
you
want
a
general
proposition.
i
want
to
know
what
does
this
general
proposition
cover.
is
the
state
court
going
to
have
to...
or
is...
before
removal
is
granted,
is
the
court
going
to
have
to
decide
whether
a
cause
of
action
is
properly
stated,
or...
or,
you
know,
whether...
whether
it
could
be
dismissed
on...
on
a
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
it
doesn't,
then
it
stays
in
state
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
there's
authority
to
remove
it,
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clark,
i
should
perhaps
have
asked
this
question
of
the
other
side,
but
they're
not
going
to
have
a
lot
of
time
left
when
they
get
back
up.
i
assume
that
it...
it
is
a
given
that
merely
setting
forth
all
of
the
elements
of
a
federal
cause
of
action
in
a
complaint
is
not
enough
to
provoke
removal.
that
is
to
say,
if
there
is
both
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
a
state
cause
of
action
which
has
the
same
elements,
if
you
plead
those
elements,
which
would
constitute
a
federal
cause
of
action,
but
you
protest
that
you
are
not
asserting
a
federal
cause
of
action,
you
are
only
asserting
a
state
cause
of
action,
that
would
not
be
removable.
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
we're...
we're
talking
about
a...
a
distinctive
rule
here
that
where
you
set
forth
the
elements
of
a...
of
a
cause
of
action
that
you
do
not
assert
to
be
a
federal
cause
of
action,
we
are
going
to
allow
it
to
be
removed
nonetheless.
right?
