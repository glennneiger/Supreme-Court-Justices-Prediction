justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
i
suppose
one
reason...
i
was
surprised
when
i
went
through.
i
thought
there
would
be
a
whole
lot
of
exclusive
federal
cause
of
action,
and...
and
there
are
very
few.
but
i
suppose
one
of
the
reasons
we
don't
get
it
very
often
is
just
what
justice
ginsburg
said.
there
are
other
provisions
where
there's
an
exclusive
federal
forum.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is...
which
is
not
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
started
to
call
you
general
waxman.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
like
the
old
days.
justice
david
h.
souter
assume...
assume
that
i...
i
agree
with
you
that...
that
on...
on
complete
preemption,
this...
this
case
passes
muster.
but
assume
also
that
in
writing
an
opinion,
i...
i
want
to
say
something
to
indicate
why
we
do
not
have
a
gathering
snowball
here.
i
mean,
we...
first,
we
had
the
labor
management
reporting.
then
we
got
in
some
erisa
cases.
now
we
recognize
this.
is
there
any
criterion
that
you
see
in...
in
at
least
the
cases
on
those
three
points
so
far,
that...
that...
or
any
language
that
points
to
a
criterion
for
when
preemption,
particularly
field
preemption,
for
example,
becomes
complete
and
when
it
doesn't?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
why
in
other
cases?
again,
assume
you...
you
made
your
point
on...
so
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned.
why
in
other
cases
aren't
courts
going
to
be,
in
effect,
remitted
to
doing
what
the...
the
court
tried
to
do
here,
and
that
is,
say,
let's
find
out
what
congress
had
in
mind?
and
we
don't
find
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
makes
it
clear,
and
therefore
it
doesn't
apply.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the...
the--

david
