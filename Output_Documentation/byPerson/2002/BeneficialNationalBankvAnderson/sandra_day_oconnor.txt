oh,
but
it's
a
claim
of
usurious
interest
charged
by
a
national
bank.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
under
the
theory
of
the
government,
that
is
a
federal
claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you...
do
you
disagree
that
section
86
of
the
national
bank
act
provides
the
sole
source
of
the
cause
of
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
argument
of
the
government
is
that
this
is
another
one
of
those
rare
cases.
that's
their
whole
point.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
it
is,
then
you're
just
wrong
about
it
being
only
a
defensive
maneuver.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
been
interpreted
by
a
number
of
cases
to
have
precisely
that
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
that
was
not
the
interpretation.
you
want
us
to
overrule
earlier
cases
about--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
meaning
of
the
national
bank
act?
