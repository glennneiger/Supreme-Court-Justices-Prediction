mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
complaint
in
this
case
alleges
that
a
national
bank
charged
excessive
interest.
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
and
consistently
since
1875
that
section
30
of
the
national
bank
act
of
1864
provides
both
the
exclusive
standards
governing
the
interest
that
a
national
bank
may
charge
and
the
exclusive
judicial
remedies
for
any
violation.
and
as
a
result,
any
claim
that
a
national
bank
charged
excessive
interest
necessarily
arises
under
federal
law,
whether
that
claim
is
brought
in
state
court
or
federal
court.
any
well-pleaded
complaint
would
reflect
that,
and
therefore,
any
claim
of
usury
against
a
national
bank,
whether
pleaded
well
or
mistakenly
or
deceptively,
falls
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
and
may
either
be
filed
there
by
a
plaintiff
or
removed
there
by
a
defendant.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
scalia,
with
respect,
i
don't
think
that
i
would
concede
the
premise
of
your
question,
that
is,
that
a
federal
cause
of
action
ordinarily
has
an
additional
element.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
leaving
that
aside--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--your...
your
hypothetical
actually
is
an
example
of
a
very
peculiar
instance
in
which,
with
respect
to
nuclear
incidents,
congress
has
imported
in...
has
federalized
the
cause.
it
created
an
express
federal
cause
of
action--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
said
expressly
that
state
law
standards
will
apply
and
it
will
be
the
law
of
whatever
state
the
incident
occurred.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
if...
if--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if...
if
any...
i
hope
i
can
remember
your
hypothetical.
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
is
definitely
removable.
it
definitely
is
completely
preempted
if
it
comes
within
the
scope
of
a
cause
of
action
that
has
been
determined
to
be
exclusive.
now,
that's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
there
may...
in
preemption
cases,
there
are
line-drawing
problems
at
the
margins
about
whether
something
is
or
isn't
preempted.
this
is
a
heartland
case
and
the
example...
the
hypothetical
you're
giving
is
let's
say
that
state
of
alabama
or
the
state
of
delaware
created
strict
liability
for
excessive
interest.
the
federal
statute
says
it
has
to
be
knowingly
under
section
86.
there
is
no
question...
no
question...
under
this
court's
decided
cases
that
a
claim
that
a
national
bank
charged
excessive
interest,
with
whatever
state
of
mind
or
lack
of
state
of
mind,
is
governed
exclusively
by
federal
standards
and
an
exclusive
federal
cause
of
action
and
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the...
the
pleading...
the
complaint
in
this
case
on
its
face
does
satisfy
the
federal
cause
of
action
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
has
to
be
one
that
if
well
pleaded...
i
mean,
a...
on
a
removal...
on
a
notice
of
removal,
the
federal
court
is
obligated,
like
any
court
determining
its
own
jurisdiction,
to
read
the
complaint
as
if
it
were
well
pleaded.
and
if,
when
the
court
reads
the
complaint,
it
says
there
is
a
federal
question
necessarily
presented
in
here
which
has
been
inartfully
not
pleaded,
the
court
then
proceeds
to
adjudicate
on
the
merits
that
claim.
if
the
answer
is
no,
if
the
answer
is,
hey,
this
guy
pleaded
a
claim
under
state
law
and
i
have
well
pleaded
it
and
it
still
doesn't
raise
a
federal
question,
then
you
remand.
and
it's
that...
that's
sort
of...
i
didn't
mean
to
quibble
with
you,
but
the
principle
that
we
suggest
is
very
straightforward
is
simply
an
application
of
this
court's
decided
jurisprudence,
under
arising-under
jurisdiction,
that
removal
jurisdiction
follows
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
indeed.
and
the...
the
perplexing
thing
about
this
case
is
the
sort
of
almost
kafkaesque
situation
that
we
have
that's
exemplified
by
the
amicus
briefs
on
both
sides
where
this
particular
instance
where
the
plaintiff
says
usury
under
state
law
even
though
the
supreme...
this...
this
court
has
decided,
since
11
years
after
the
act
was
passed
in
the
civil
war,
that
there
is
no
such
state
claim,
we
now
have
a...
a
group
of
plaintiffs
lawyers
from
california
urging
this
court
to
establish
a
right
to
plead
something
that
in
their
own
case
they
say
is
only,
quote,
defensively
preempted.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
no
one
has...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
correct.
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
as
there...
as
is
the
norm,
as
this
court
has
explained.
and
there
are
instances
in
which
these
cases
are
litigated
to
the
merits
in
state
court
and
instances
in
which
they're
litigated
in
federal
court
either
because
they're
brought
there
by
the
plaintiff,
as
the
plaintiff
could
have
here,
or
they're
removed
there
as
the
defendant.
and
the
other
principle
that
this
case
reflects,
as
i
said,
is
not
just
the
importance
of
parity
in
federal
question
jurisdiction
between
giving
plaintiffs
and
defendants
parity
in
invoking
the
federal
courts
if
they
choose,
but
the
requirement
that
this
court
has
stated
over
and
over
and
over
again
that
in...
in
determining
its
own
jurisdiction,
the
federal
court
will
construe
the
complaint
as
well-pleaded.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
actually
is
very,
very
narrow.
and
we
can
go
through
in
detail,
but
almost
all
of
the
statutory
schemes
that
the...
the
state's
amicus
brief
cites
are
not,
in
fact,
examples
of
complete
preemption.
but
it...
it
comes
up
only
in
the
instance
where
there
is
not
only
substantive
preemption
by
federal
law
and
the
creation
of
a
federal
cause
of
action,
but
the
determination
that
that
cause
of
action
is,
in
fact,
exclusive.
and
that
is
the
difficult
and
close
question
that
this
court--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
it
wasn't
a
removal
case.
and
in
fact,
depending
on
when
in
1875
it
was
decided,
there
may
or
may
not
have
been--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
may
not
have
been
removal.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
it
is
a...
if
i
understand
the
reference,
i
think
it
is
a
white
horse
case
in
the
sense...
in
this
sense,
mr.
chief
justice.
we're
not
contending
that
the
1864
act
evinced
an
intent
to
make
these
causes
of
action
removable,
even
if
pleaded
under
state
law,
because
there
was
no
general
federal
question
jurisdiction,
and
it
wasn't
provided
in
the
law.
the
relevant
question
and
the
relevant
question
that
this
court
deemed
to
be
close
in
metropolitan
life
in
the
erisa
context
is
whether...
okay,
fine,
federal
law
has
substantively
preempted
the
field
or
by
conflict
or
whatever.
is
the
creation
of
the
federal
cause
of
action
of
such
force
that
it
should
be
deemed
to
be
exclusive?
and
that,
i
think,
is
what
this
court
decided
first
in
farmers'
and
mechanics'
bank
by
saying
to
the
borrower
in
that
case...
the
borrower
was
maintaining
that
under
new
york
state
law,
it
was
entitled
to
void
not...
to
forfeit
not
just
the
interest,
but
the
note.
and
this
court
said,
look,
new
york
state
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
this.
this
is
a
claim
of
usury
by
a
national
bank.
the
federal
standards
are
exclusive,
and
the
federal
penalty
expressly
will
not
permit
forfeiture
of
the
note.
only
the
interest.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
not
at
all.
and
in
fact,
it
was
expressly
contemplated.
then
as
now,
these
actions
can
be
brought
and
are
often
brought
in
state
courts.
all
that
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that...
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
the
same
is
true
for
the
types
of
erisa
claims
that
were
at
issue
in
metropolitan
life.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
correct.
for
example,
the
copyright
act.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
copyright
act
certainly
is
an
example
of
complete
preemption,
but
there's
a
statutory
provision
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--here's...
here's
why,
justice
scalia.
the
very
difficult...
this
court
made
clear
in
metropolitan
life,
if
it
wasn't
clear
before,
that
it
wasn't
going
to
infer
from
congressional
silence
very
lightly
that
when
congress
created
a
federal
cause
of
action,
it
meant
it
to
be
exclusive
so
that
it
would
displace
state
causes
of
action.
there's
a
very
strong
and
longstanding
presumption
to
the
contrary.
but
that
difficult
question
was
decided
in
the
context
of
section
30
of
the
national
bank
act
beginning
in
1875
for
reasons
that
are
explained
in
this
court's
opinion
and
in
the
comptroller's
report
that
the
government
cites
that
precipitated
the
enactment
of
section
30,
which
is
that
this
was
war
legislation.
this
was
a...
the
creation
of
the
national
banks
was
hoped
by
congress
and
president
lincoln
that
it
would
provide
the
means
with
which
the
government
could
continue
to
fund
the
war,
and
national
banks
would
knit
the
country
together
when
the
war
was
finished.
and
the
one
thing
that
comes
out
of
the
history
of
this
case
and
is
reflected
in
this
court's
opinions
is
that
they
feared,
based
on
their
experience
with
the
first
bank
of
the
united
states
and
the
second
bank
of
the
united
states,
that
jealous
states,
states
that
were
jealous
of
their
state-chartered
banks,
which
were
issuing
paper
at
the
time,
would
engage
in
predations
against
the
national
banks
that
were
created
at
the
very
same
time
that
section
30
was
enacted
and,
in
essence,
smother
this
important
federal
infant
in
its
crib.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
r-18.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
there
has
to
be
substantive...
congress
has
to
supply
the
exclusive
substantive
standards.
it
has
to
create
a
cause
of
action
to
remedy
violations
of
those
standards,
and
this
is
the
hard
part.
and
it
also
has
to
make
clear
that
that...
that
judicial
remedy
is,
in
fact,
exclusive,
that
is,
that
it
will
not
permit
the
existence
or
operation
of
state
law
causes
of
action,
even
those
that
import
the
federal
standards
and
my--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--you...
you
have
to
find
out
what
congress
had
in
mind,
but
i
think
this
court
has
made
clear
in
metropolitan
life
that
it
is
going
to
be
the
rare,
rare,
rare
day
when
the
federal
courts
will
infer
from
congressional
silence
that
a
federal
cause
of
action
is
to
be
exclusive.
and
the
other
examples
in...
in
which...
in
the
federal
law
in
which
there
is,
in
fact,
complete
preemption,
the
fela
or
the
carmack
amendment
as
an
example,
congress
has
gone
ahead
and
expressly
made
those
actions
nonremovable.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
scalia,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
if
there
are--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--your
question
was
if...
if
you...
you
said
this
would
take
time,
and
it
will.
you
pleaded
all
the
elements
of
a
federal
cause
of
action,
but
it
also...
it
also
satisfies
a
state
cause
of
action.
if
the
federal
cause
of
action
is
not
exclusive
except
in
that
rare
instance,
it
is
not
removable.
justice
breyer,
yes,
indeed
we
say
that
you
stop
at
point
3.
that
is,
you
determine
whether
or
not
this
is
the
rare
instance
in
which
there's
not
only
substantive
preemption
but
exclusive
federal
remedies.
and
the
reason
you
stop
is
because
we
have
federal
question
jurisdiction.
it
says
that
removal
is
tied
to
original
jurisdiction,
and
therefore,
the
question
is,
does
the
complaint
well-pleaded
necessarily
state
a
cause
of
action?
justice
holmes
indicated
in
a
statement
that
is
oft
repeated
and,
if
it's
anything,
is
under-inclusive,
as
this
court
indicated
i
think
in
merrell
dow,
that
a
suit
arises
under
the
law
that
creates
the
cause
of
action.
if
the
cause
of
action
is
exclusively
federal,
in
that
rare
instance,
it's
under
arising-under
jurisdiction.
justice
kennedy
i
think
asked
what
for
me
is
the
most
difficult
question
in
this
court's
sometimes
not
fully
explicated
arising-under
jurisdiction,
which
is
the
question
that
was
addressed
in
merrell
dow
and
in
particular
in
footnote
1
in
this
court's
opinion
in
merrell
dow,
which
is
if
you
have
a
state
cause
of
action
misrepresentation,
but
it
has
embedded
with
it
as
a
necessary
matter
a
conclusion
about
whether
federal
law
was
or
was
not
satisfied,
does
that
state
claim
arise
under
federal
jurisdiction?
in
franchise
tax
board,
this
court
repeated
dicta
that
suggests
that
the
answer
is
yes.
and
in
smith
versus
kansas
city
title
and
trust,
this...
this
court
seemed
to
indicate
yes.
but
in
moore
versus
chesapeake...
the
chesapeake
and
ohio
railway,
the
court
suggested
that
the
embedded
federal
question
has
to
be
central
to
the
state
cause
of
action
and
really
important.
and
the
result,
as
i...
as
i
think
things
stand
now,
is
we
have
a
very
long
footnote
1
in
this
court's
opinion
in
merrell
dow
that
says
many
people
have
difficulty
resolving
our
jurisprudence
in
this
area,
but
in
the
merrell
dow
context,
where
there
was
a
state
tort
claim
that
could...
may
i
finish
my--
