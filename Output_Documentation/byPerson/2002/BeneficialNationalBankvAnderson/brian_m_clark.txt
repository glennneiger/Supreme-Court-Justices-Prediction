mr.
brian
m.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
federal
jurisdiction
is
necessarily
limited
jurisdiction.
federal
removal
jurisdiction
is
limited
by
statute
to
those
cases
that
arise
under
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states.
plaintiffs
have
brought
no
cause
of
action
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
that
arises
under
the...
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states.
as
such,
there's
no
federal
jurisdiction
under
long-held
jurisdiction--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--it
is
a--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--under
the
theory
of
the
government,
it...
the
claim,
as
pled,
is
under
alabama
code
section
8-8-1.
and
any
interposition
of
federal
law
at
all
is
necessarily
interposed
by
the
defendant
in
this
case.
and
under
this
court's
decisions
in
gully,
which
was
a
national
bank
act
case,
caterpillar,
metlife,
franchise
tax
board,
the
imposition
of
a
federal
defense
does
not
create--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--are
you
talking
about
where
the...
where
the...
a...
a
complaint
is
pled
by...
by
an...
by
a
georgia
plaintiff
against
an
alabama
corporation,
it
will
be
removed
because--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--because
there's
diversity?
mr.
brian
m.
clark
right.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
right.
well,
in
that
case
you
have
a...
you
have
a...
you
have
factual
inaccuracy
in
the
pleading.
in
this
case,
we're
not
talking
about
their
basis
for
removal
is
not
some
factual
inaccuracy
of
the
pleading,
it's
that
they're
saying
that
your
legal
theory,
plaintiff,
which
you,
under
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
are
allowed
to
choose
your
own
legal
theories,
you've
decided
to
travel
on
the
alabama
statute--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--well--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--the
argument
that
they
are
making
is
that
there's
no
claim
is...
is
misstating.
there
is
a
claim.
what...
what
your
honor
is
discussing
is
the
principle
of
ordinary
preemption.
whether
or
not
that
alabama
state
law
claim
may
proceed
is
a
question
of
ordinary
preemption
as
to
be...
to
be
distinguished
from
complete
preemption.
and
the
court
held
in...
in
caterpillar
that...
that
a
case
may
not
be
removed
on
a
federal
defense,
including
the
defense
of
preemption,
even
if
the
defense
is
anticipated
by
both
parties.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
that's
an
ordinary...
ordinary
preemption
case...
case
also.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
right,
and--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--right,
and
that's
exactly
what
they
have
in
this
case,
a
mere
defense
in
this
case.
and--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--it
does
not
provide
the
sole
source
of
the
cause
of
action
that
the
plaintiffs
have
pled
in
this
case,
and
that's
the
difference
here
is...
is
the
source
of
sort
of
organic
law
as
to
where
the...
where
the
complaint
comes
from.
assume
there
were...
the
defendants
never
brought
up
this...
this
claim
or
this
defense
of
federal
preemption.
the
alabama
case
would...
the
alabama
usury
claim
would
go
forward
under
alabama
law
and
would
be
decided
under
alabama
law.
so
it's
important
to...
to
see
the
distinction
between...
between
what's
being...
what's
being
pled
and
a
defense
to
what's
being
pled.
now,
as...
as
was
stated--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--why
isn't...
your
honor,
why
isn't...
why
isn't
the...
the
cause
of
action
we've
brought--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--well--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--as
this
court
stated
in
the
caterpillar
case
under
note
4,
the
question
of
the
breadth
of
the--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--well,
but
the
question
of
the
breadth--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--of
the
remedy
provided--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--right.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
under
supremacy
clause--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--that
is...
yes,
that
is
what
those
cases
hold.
however--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--however--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--however,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
claim
is
preempted
ordinarily
is
a...
a
wholly
different
question
from
whether
or
not
there's
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
we...
it
appears
that
there
is
no...
there
is
no
state
claim
on
the
usury.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
well,
if
the...
if
my
client...
if
we
decided
to
travel
under
the
federal
cause
of
action...
and
what
this
goes
back
to
is
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule.
plaintiffs
in...
in
cases
are
allowed
to
choose
their
remedies.
and
in
this
case
the
plaintiffs
chose
a
remedy
under
the
alabama
usury
statute,
be--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--well,
and
again,
that
is
a
defense...
the
claim...
as
the
court
said
in
metlife,
the
touchstone
is
not
whether
or
not
preemption
is
obvious,
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
creates
removal
jurisdiction.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
and
that
has
to
appear
from
the
face
of
the
complaint.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
the
problem
with
that
test
is
it's
not
a...
it's
not
a
test.
it
adds
another
layer
of...
of
litigation
to...
to
almost
any
claim.
and
what
you're
going
to
have
is,
instead
of
following
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
that
for
years
has
served
this
court,
you're
going
to
have
all
manner
of
state
law
causes
of
action
all
of
the
sudden
removed
and
then
you're
going
to
have
this
litigation
over...
over,
well,
does
it
state
a
cognizable
cause
of
action
under...
under
state
law
or
is
it
part
of--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--congress
has
not
provided
for
exclusive
federal
cause
of
action
to
govern
an
alabama
usury
claim.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
as
a
matter
of
ordinary
preemption,
and
maybe--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--exactly.
and
if
i...
if
i
understood
the
question,
then
i
misunderstood
the
question.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
as
a
matter
of
ordinary
preemption,
it
may
very
well
be
that...
that--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--the
state
claim
and
congress...
and
congress
intended
that.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
but
as
a
matter
of
complete
preemption,
under...
under
what
i
was
saying
in
the
metlife
and
the
caterpillar
case,
those
do
not
jurisdiction
make.
in
the
gully...
gully
case
itself,
it
said
a
suit
brought
upon
a
state
statute
dues
not
arise
under
an
act
of
congress
because
prohibited
thereby.
that
is
exactly
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
we
have
a
state
law
cause
of
action.
we
have
the
defendant
interposing
a
defense
saying,
your
state
law
cause
of
action
is
prohibited
by
that...
by
that...
by
the
federal
act,
and
now
we
want
to
create
removal
jurisdiction
because
of
that.
it's
interesting.
this
court
has
always
found--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--yes.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
yes.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
the...
the
source
of
law
pled
in
the
complaint
is
alabama
state
law.
now,
the
fact
that
it
may
be
ordinary...
ordinarily
preempted
is
something
that...
that
the
defendants
can
raise
and
the
state
courts
can
decide.
and
the
state
courts
have
often...
often
decided
matters
of
federal
preemption.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
well,
in...
in...
there
are
many
federal
statutes
that
would
run
concurrently
with
state
regulation
of...
of
business.
and
if...
if
the
question
is,
is
the
fact
that
there's
a
federal
remedy
provided,
in
addition
to
the
state
remedy...
does
that
provide...
provide
removal
jurisdiction,
the
answer
would
be...
would
be
no
to
that
question.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
right.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
again,
i
would--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--well,
again,
i
would
go
back
to
this
court's
concept
of
federalism
wherein
the...
the
state
courts
are
allowed
to
make
that
call.
and
in
avco,
which
established
the...
this
platypus
of...
of
field
preemption
or
complete
preemption
is
very
limited
to...
to
those
actions
construing
the
collective...
collective
bargaining
agreements.
and
then
it
was
reluctantly
extended
by
this
court
in
the
metropolitan
life
and
taylor
cases,
and--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--but
this--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--this...
if
this
another
case,
it
is
a
wholly
separate
and...
and
distinguished...
distinct
way
to
go
because
the
national
bank
act
carries
with
it
none
of
the
indicia
of
the
intent
of
congress
to
completely
preempt
that
the
lmra
does.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
to
have
ordinary
preemptive
effect
which--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--absolutely
not.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
no.
but
in
the...
in
the
lmra
context,
you
have
specific
jurisdictional
grant
to
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states.
then
when
erisa
came
along,
with
taylor
you
have...
you
have
specific
legislative
history
saying
that
this
is
to
be
interpreted
under
the
avco
rule,
which
is
to...
which
is
to...
to
have
a
body
of
federal
law
deciding
all
cases,
no
matter
where
brought,
under...
under
erisa
or
deciding
all
cases
under
collective
bargaining.
in
this
case,
there's
no...
in
national
bank
act,
there's
no...
there
is
no
body
of
federal
law
that
could
ever
arise,
and
it's
because
the
nature
of
the
national
bank
act
is
really
more
of
a
hierarchy
of
state
laws.
it
says,
national
bank
act,
you
can...
you
can
charge
either
the
interest
rate
in
the
state
in
which
the
claim
is
brought,
you
can
charge
the
interest
rate
in
the
state
in
which
the
bank
is
located,
or
you
can
charge...
and
there's
a
default
federal
interest
rate.
so
what
you're
going
to
have
here
is
sort
of
a
patchwork
of
state
law
decisions
concerning
the
state...
state
law
of
delaware
versus
alabama
versus
kentucky
versus
michigan.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
ordinarily.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
ordinarily
preempt.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
well--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--i'm
sorry
if
i...
i
misunderstood
your
question
before.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
and
in
fact,
in
the...
in
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
in
the
metlife/taylor
case,
he
said,
you
know,
that...
that
congressional
intent
is
the
touchstone
here,
and
that
this
court
would
be
well
served
not
to
infer
removal
jurisdiction
unless
there
is
some
clear
evidence
of
congressional
intent
to
do
so
like
in
an
erisa
case
or
like
in
the
lmra
case.
mr.
brian
m.
clark
no,
it
would
not
be.
and
that--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--if...
if
what
the
defendants
are
arguing,
it
would
be
a
new
rule.
and
it...
it
is
a
departure
from--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--there...
there
is
concurrent
lawmaking
authority.
however,
because
of
the
supremacy
clause,
the
courts
have
held
that...
that
there
is
ordinary
preemption
in
this
case.
but
that
does
not
answer
the
question
whether
or
not
should...
there
should
be
removal
jurisdiction
in
the
case.
and
it's...
in
other
words,
the
alabama
legislature
certainly
has
the
right
to
make...
make
law
regulating
federal
banks.
in
fact,
this
court
decided
way
back
in
1870
that
national
banks
are
subject
to
state
law
regulation.
and
in
fact,
the
quote
from
the
case
something
like
in
their
daily
activities,
they're
regulated
much
more
under--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--if...
if
the
preemption,
ordinary
preemption,
is...
is
applied,
it...
it
would...
applied
as
it
has
been,
it
would
be
dismissed.
however,
that
is
a
wholly
separate
question
from
whether
the
case
arises
under
federal
jurisdiction.
it
is
a
question
of
ordinary
preemption
that
the
state
courts--
mr.
brian
m.
clark
--well,
and...
plaintiffs
have
different
reasons
for
pleading
the
things
they
do.
under
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule,
of
course,
it's
their
prerogative
to
rise
and
fall
on
the
causes
of
action
that
they
choose
to
plead.
however,
i
go
back
to
the
metlife
case
which
the
court
said
it's
not
the
obviousness
of
preemption
defense
but
the
intent
of
congress.
and
i
think
in
answer
to
the
question
over
there,
is
why...
why
go
that
extra
step?
well,
because
this
court
has
decided
in
metlife
that
that
extra
step
is
necessary
to
stop
this
slippery
slope
down
where
every
case
that
is
removed
out
of
a
state
court,
you
now
have
this
other
layer
of...
of
litigation
over,
well,
is
there
another
cause
of
action
and...
and
perhaps
that
we
have
to
find
some...
we
have
to
litigate
over
whether
it's
an
exclusive
cause
of
action.
and
the
answer
to
that
is
this
court
has
provided,
for
right
or
for
wrong,
since
1887
that
we
follow
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
and
it
follows
the
language
in
the...
at
the
end
of
the
gully
opinion
saying
that
what
you
need
is
a
clear
bright
line
limitation.
and
only
where
we
find
some
clear
congressional
intent,
such
as
in
the
lmra
situation,
such
as
in
the
erisa
situation,
do
we
make
this
extreme
and
extraordinary
grant
of
field
preemption
or
complete
preemption
or
whole
preemption.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
sit
down.
