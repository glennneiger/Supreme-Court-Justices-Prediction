mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
more
than
125
years,
it
has
been
clear
that
the
national
bank
act
provides
the
exclusive
cause
of
action
for
a
claim
of
usury
against
a
national
bank.
because
the
national
bank
act
provides
the
sole
available
avenue
of
relief,
any
claim
that
a
national
bank
has
committed
usury
can
arise
only
under
that
federal
law.
the
national
bank--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--a
failure
to
state
a
claim
on
which
relief
is
granted
does
not
deprive
the
federal
court
of
jurisdiction
over
the
claim.
so
the
simple
failure
to
state
a
claim
wouldn't
prevent
it
from
being
removable
if
the...
if
the
claim
was
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
cause
of
action,
if
it
was
a
colorable
claim.
now,
if...
if
the
claim--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--if...
if
the
claim
was
not
colorable--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
here...
here
we...
we
don't
have
that
situation,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--when
it's
removed,
the
federal
court
decides
whether
there's
jurisdiction
under
federal
law,
whether
there's
arising-under
jurisdiction,
and
decides
whether
the...
the
complaint
is
properly
pleaded,
the
true
nature
of
the
complaint
states
a
claim
under
federal
law.
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--if
it
doesn't,
then
it
can
remand
the
state...
the
case
back
to
state
court,
but
it
would
have
decided,
in
essence,
that
the
claim
should
be
dismissed
at
the
same
time
by
deciding--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
to
the
extent
that
the
state
claim
requires
the
decision
that
a...
a
determination
that
there
were
excessive
interest
charges
by
a
national
bank,
then
the
claim
would
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
cause
of
action.
but
that
wouldn't
mean
that
there
couldn't
be
claims
for
misrepresentation
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
complaint--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
state
cause
of
action
is
just
misrepresentation.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
then
that
would
not
be
removable.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
removable,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that...
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
but
the
existence
of
pendent
state
claims
doesn't
defeat
removal
jurisdiction
just
as
it
doesn't
defeat
original
jurisdiction.
there
were
pendent
state
claims
in
the
metropolitan
life
case,
yet--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--exactly,
your
honor.
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute,
1367,
expressly
provides
for
federal
court
jurisdiction
in
those
instances.
they
would
come
with...
with
the
claim
to
federal
court.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that's...
that's
right,
your
honor.
the...
the
misrepresentation
claim
and
the
suppression
claim
are
both
species
of
fraud
claim
under
state
law.
they
don't
come
within
the...
the
scope
of
the
cause
of
action
in
the
national
bank
act,
and
they're
not,
on
their
own
terms,
arise
under
federal
law
and
they
would
not
be
removable.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
what...
what...
i
tried
to
distinguish
between
failure
to
state
a
claim,
which
i
agree
the
simple
failure
to
state
a
claim
is...
is
not
a
ground
for
lack
of
federal
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
there
is
no
alabama
claim
because
the
only
claim
can
arise
under
federal
law.
so
it...
so
it
is
removable
and
then
the
federal
court
would
assert
federal
jurisdiction,
which
it
has
over
the
claim
and
dismiss
it.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
but...
but
that
was
the
initial
question
that
i...
that
i
understood
justice
scalia
to
be
asking.
but
then
he
said,
if
it's
not
colorable
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
what
happens
then?
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
practical
difference.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
critical...
you
have
to
know--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--there
still...
there
still
could
be
a
colorable
claim
under--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--we
don't
know
what
the
rate--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--you
don't
know
what
the
rate
is,
your
honor,
under
federal
law
without...
without
more
facts
about
the
complaint
because
the
national
bank
act
provides
the...
the
possibility
the
national
bank
can
charge
any
of
three
rates.
but
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
fundamental...
the
fundamental
point
is
that...
that
it's
removable
if
there's
jurisdiction
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
if...
if
there
is...
if
the
claim
properly
pleaded
states
a
claim
over
which
there's
federal
jurisdiction,
if
it
was
pled
as
a
claim
under
the
national
bank
act--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
you
can--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no...
no,
your
honor.
you
can
remove
it
if
there's...
if
there's
original...
would
be
original
jurisdiction
over
the
complaint.
and
that
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
characterized
as
a...
as
a
complaint
under
state
law,
which
doesn't...
doesn't
exist
because
it's
been
entirely
displaced,
or
if
it's
properly
pled
as
a...
as
a
claim
under
federal
law.
you
could
just
as
easily
ask
if
they
state
the
claim--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i'm
telling
you
that
if
the...
if
there's
no
colorable
claim--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the...
the
removal
statute
gives
the...
gives
the...
the
federal
courts...
gives
the
defendant
the
right
to
remove
to
a
federal
forum
any
claim
that
arises
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--and
so...
so
the
question
is
whether
it
arises
under,
whether
there's
original
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i'm...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
you're
right.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
if
there...
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
it's
not
a
situation
where
it
arises
under
the
exclusive
cause
of
action
for
usury
under
the
national
bank
act.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
federal...
the
federal
claim
would
be
removable
to...
to
federal
court,
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
it's
removal.
thank
you.
