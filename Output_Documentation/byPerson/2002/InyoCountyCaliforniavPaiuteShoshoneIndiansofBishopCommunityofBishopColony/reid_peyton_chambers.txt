mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
thank
you,
mr.--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
mr.
chambers.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
thank
you.
thanks,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
principles
of
federal
law
that
bar
this
search
warrant.
the
first
is
tribal
sovereign
immunity.
the
second
is
the
longstanding
principle
that
states
may
not
infringe
the
right
of
tribes
to
govern
themselves
or
internal
affairs
on
their
reservation.
and
the
third
is
that
there's
no
act
of
congress
that
authorizes
this
search
warrant,
though
two
statutes,
public
law
280
and
the
indian
gaming
regulatory
act,
do
provide
a
framework
for
some
assumption
of
state
jurisdiction
over
tribes
and
indians
on
reservation...
the...
reservations.
the
county
doesn't
claim
that
either
applies
here
to
authorize
this
act,
and
they
do
not.
i...
i
want
to
address,
if
i
may,
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
commercial
and
governmental
distinction
because
basically
the
indian
gaming
act
by
congress
sets
up
a
framework
for
tribes
to
operate
gaming.
this
is
a
tribal
enterprise.
it
has
to
be,
under
the
gaming
act,
owned
and
controlled
by
the
tribe.
it...
and
the
proceeds
of
the
gaming
have
to
be
used
for
tribal
purposes,
chiefly
tribal
governmental
purposes.
and
they
are
by
the
bishop
paiute
tribe.
the
bishop
paiute
tribe
is
a
small
tribe
in
a
remote
area
of
california.
it
uses
all
of
its
gaming
revenues
to
operate
tribal
programs
on
its
reservation.
like
most
tribes,
the
bishop...
the
bishop
tribe
operates
a
health
clinic,
for
example,
educational
programs,
welfare
programs--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--certainly,
justice
stevens.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
the...
the
tribe
is
not
taxable
under
the
federal
income
tax
laws,
justice
stevens.
and...
and
the
corporation,
as
an
arm
of
the
tribe,
is
not
taxable.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
there...
there
are
no
taxes.
this
is
a
relatively
small
casino.
it's
in
a
pretty
remote
part
of
california,
sort
of
halfway
between
los
angeles--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--well,
justice
stevens,
it's
operated
by
a
corporation
that
was
chartered
by
the
tribe.
it's
wholly
owned
by
the
tribe.
and
it...
it...
the
board
of
directors,
for
example,
is
removable--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--no,
the
tribe,
justice
stevens.
the
tribe
owns
all
the
real
estate
on
this
small
reservation
in
eastern
california.
it's
an
800-acre
real
estate...
or
trust
land.
it's
owned
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
tribe.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
they'd
be
tribal
property,
justice
stevens,
and
operated--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--no,
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
stevens.
it's
a
simply
a
tribal
arm
and...
and
it's...
it's...
it
is
the
tribe.
and
it
has
to
be
the
tribe
under
the
indian
gaming
act.
my
point
is
that
congress--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--it...
it
operates
the
gaming
facility
rather
than
having
the
tribal
political
leaders,
justice
scalia,
engaged
in
the
day-to-day
operation
of
the...
of
the
gaming
activity.
but
it's--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--well,
let
me
try
to
persuade
you
it
doesn't,
justice
kennedy.
that
the...
i
mean
here,
first
of
all,
the
indian
gaming
act
was
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
strengthening
tribal
governments.
that's
what
congress
was
doing.
secondly,
congress
required
the
tribe
to
own
and
control
gaming
operations.
and
third,
congress
limited
the
revenues
that
the
tribe
gets
from
the
gaming
operation
to
be
used
essentially
for
the
welfare
of
the
members
of
the--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--but,
justice
breyer,
there
of
course
the
country,
the
legislature,
or
the
government
of
that
country
could
decide
what
to
do
with
its
revenues.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
there
are
two
differences,
justice
breyer.
first,
the
finnish
government,
if
it
wanted
to
could
decide
to
invest
the
proceeds
of
the
shipping
line
in
the
u.s.
stock
market.
the
tribe
cannot
do
that.
the
tribe
is
constrained
by
congress
to
use
the
revenues
essentially
for
governmental
purposes
or
for
charitable
donations
or
a
couple
of
other
purposes.
but
it's
not...
it's
like
a
state
lottery
i
suppose,
although
even
there
the
state
legislature
could
decide
to
use
the
state
lottery
for
some
other
purpose.
the
second
distinction
really
was
i
think
pointed
out
in...
in
justice
souter's
question
to...
i
forget
whether
it
was
to
mr.
kirby
or
ms.
mcdowell.
but...
but
congress
has
enacted
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
which
provides
that
a
commercial
enterprise
of
a
foreign
nation
operating
in
the
united
states
is
stripped
of
its
sovereign
immunity.
congress
has
never
done
that
for
a
tribe,
and
it's
very
important
to
note
that
while
sovereign
immunity
in
the
tribal
context
is
a
common
law
doctrine
developed
by
this
court,
it
has
been
adopted
by
congress.
most
importantly,
in
the
indian
self-determination
act
of
1975--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--justice
ginsburg,
as
you
pointed
out,
there
was
a
dissent
there,
but
a
difference
in
kiowa
county
is
that
you
had
a
tribe
engaged
in
the
commercial
operation
outside
the
reservation.
that's
not
so
here.
this
is
entirely
on
the
reservation.
it's
a
tribe--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--i
hope
i
can
persuade
you
that
it
does,
justice
scalia,
that...
that...
the
sovereign
immunity
basically
covers
funds
and
property
and
the
operation
of
a
tribal
or
any
government,
whether
it's
the
federal
government,
a
state
government,
or
a
tribal
government.
and
it
protects
that
categorically
from
judicial
process
of
a
non-superior
sovereign.
here
the
tribe
is
not
subordinate
to
the
state
of
california.
the
tribe
is
subordinate
to
the
united
states
and
the
county
is
subordinate
to
the
state
of
california.
but
the
tribe
is
not
subordinate
to
california.
so
the
tribe's
policy
cannot
be
displaced
by
california
when
it's
operating
its
own
government.
now,
this
could
apply
to
any
record
of
the
tribe,
and...
and
the
tribe
operates,
as
i
said,
health
care
programs,
educational
programs.
all...
virtually
all
indian
tribes
do
this
today,
and
it's--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--justice--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--justice
kennedy,
public
law
280
confers
criminal
jurisdiction
on
california
on
offenses
by
or
against
indians.
that's
the
language
of
public
law
280.
it
does
not
apply
to
tribes.
the
court
held
in
the
bryan
v.
itasca
county
case
that
public
law
280
does
not
apply
to
tribes,
and
in
the
second
three
affiliated
tribes
decision,
the
court
said
that
public
law
280
does
not
waive
tribal
immunity
or
interfere
with
tribal
rights
of
self-governance.
so...
so
public
law
280...
and
the
state
doesn't
claim...
i'm
sorry...
the
county
doesn't
claim
that
the
state
has
any
jurisdiction
over
the
tribe
under
public
law
280.
that
proceeds
really
to
another
reason
why
the...
why
the
warrant
is
not
good
here
under
federal
law.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
tribe
isn't
sheltering
anybody.
this
tribe
wouldn't
shelter
anybody
and...
and
tribes
don't
do
that.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
okay.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
justice
kennedy,
i
think
how
it
should
apply
is
that
the
rule
should
encourage
cooperative
intergovernmental
agreements
between
tribes
and
counties,
and
that
is
in
fact
what
happens
all
over
indian
reservations
today,
that--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--justice
ginsburg,
the
tribe
tried
to
avoid
this
confrontation.
first,
the
tribe
did
get
a
letter
asking
for
information
about
three
employees
without
any
specification
of
why.
the
tribe
responded
that
its
policies
do
not
allow
a
disclosure
of
employee
information
without
the
consent
of
the
employees.
then,
without
any
further
notice,
the
county
came
to
the
tribe
with
armed
officers
and
insisted
on
seeing
the
records.
now,
the
reason
that...
i
mean,
the
tribe
has
security
officers
in
the
casino.
they
came
in
a
private
part
of
the
casino.
but
obviously
the
tribe
doesn't
want
that
kind
of
confrontation.
they
told
the
officers
where
the
records
were.
the
officers
went
with
deadbolt
cutters
into
the
tribe's
building,
cut
the
locks,
and
seized
the
records.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
i
believe
that
is
correct
at
the
time
that
the
search
warrant
was
executed,
justice
ginsburg.
now,
the
tribe
took
that
hit
basically.
i
mean,
the
tribe
didn't
do
anything.
they
approached
the
district
attorney.
they
said
we
don't
want
to
have
this
kind
of
thing
happening
again
and
offered
to
work
it
out
by
accepting
simply
a
copy
of
the
last
page
of
the...
california
law
requires
a
welfare
applicant
to
sign
an
acknowledgement
that
employers
can
turn
records
over
to
the
county
investigating
welfare
fraud.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
i
think
ms.
mcdowell
is
right,
justice
ginsburg.
but...
but
i
guess
one
would
have
to
look
at
the
regulation,
and
i'm
sure
the
court
will.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
i
think
that
you
have
to
choose
a...
a
solution
that
respects
the
tribe's
operation
as
a
government.
the
tribe--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--well,
what's
wrong
with
that
here
is
we
don't
have
imaginary
parties.
we
have
real
parties
here.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
i
understand
your
hypothetical
and
i...
i
don't
want
to
say
it's
not
this
case.
i
know
i'm
not
supposed
to
say
that.
but
i...
but
i
think
that...
that
the...
i
mean,
here
what
you
have
is
a
tribe
that
tried
to
work
it
out.
the
tribe
was
willing
and
is
willing
to
sign
an
intergovernmental
law
enforcement
agreement
with
the
county.
tribes
and
counties
do
this
all
over
the
country.
you
know
this,
for
example,
from
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
four
states
on
behalf
of
the
tribe
in
this
case,
four
states
that
have
two-thirds
of
the
indian
reservation
trust
lands
in
the
country
in
their
borders
and
the
majority
of
indians
who
live
on
reservations
within
their
borders.
those
states
say
that
they
work
it
out
between
tribes
and
counties,
tribes
and
states.
tribes
have
agreements
all
over
the
country
with
counties
about
domesticating
search
warrants,
about
extradition--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--well,
justice
scalia,
i...
i
think
that
ascribes...
tribes
do
try
to
operate...
tribes
have
a
very
strong
interest
in
law
enforcement
too.
and...
and
there
were
plenty
of
alternatives
here
available
to
the
county.
the
county
could
have
gone
and
gotten
a
search
warrant
against
the
individuals.
that...
those
are
the
people
they
had
to
prove
had
the
intent
to
defraud
them
anyway.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
they
would
presumably,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
have
their
bank
accounts
or...
or
canceled
checks
or...
or
other
information.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
justice
ginsburg,
the
tribe
is
required
under
its
compact
with
the
state
of
california
to
file
certain
information
because
the
tribe,
for
example,
participates--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--if
it
doesn't,
there
are
dispute
resolution
mechanisms
in
the
compact
and
there's
a
waiver
of
tribal
sovereign
immunity
for
the
enforcement
of
those
dispute
resolution
provisions.
so
the
answer
to
the
question
in...
in
that
situation
is
that
the
state
could
get
that
information.
but
here
the
tribe
has
filed
all
the
things
it's
required
under
that
compact
to
file
with
the
state--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--justice
stevens,
in
that
case
they
would
sue
in
state
court
because
the
state
would
have
jurisdiction
over
a
civil
action,
even
actually
in
a
public
law
280
state
between
an
indian
and
an
indian.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
the
state
would
have
jurisdiction
over
that
suit,
justice
stevens,
unless
the
nature
of
the--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--i
was
going
to
say--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--they
could
not
get
discovery
to
the
extent
that
it
would
intrude
on
essential
governmental
functions
of
the
tribe
because
that
would
be--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--no...
no,
they
could
not
without
the
tribe's
consent,
justice
stevens.
but
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
if
the
tribe
understood
the
nature
and
need
of
the
issue,
why,
almost
surely
it
would
comply
with
a...
with
a
request
like
that.
but--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
see
i
haven't
persuaded
you.
i...
i
think
they
are
given
the
nature
of
congress'
oversight
and
limitations
congress
has
put
on
the
operation
of
this
facility
and...
and
all
tribal
gaming
facilities.
so
this
isn't
just
any
tribal
business.
this
is
a
business
that's
operated
under
pretty
strict
guidelines
by
congress
for
it
to
be
owned
and
operated
by
the
tribe.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
it
could
well
be
different,
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
it
filed
it
under
several...
under
1331
and
1983,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
well,
if
you...
yes,
if
the
court
decides
that--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--justice
o'connor,
you
should
do
so
because...
because
section
1983
is
a
broad
remedial
statute
for
violations
of
federal
rights
by
states.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
don't
think
you
have.
i--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--no,
but...
but--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--no,
it
doesn't,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
yes,
you
did.
you
did
in
the
context
of
a
pretty
late
capital
punishment--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--interception
by
paraguay.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
justice
souter,
it's
not
good
because
there
wasn't
a
history
in
1871
of
states
impacting
negatively
on
states'
federal
rights
or
on
the
federal
rights
of
foreign
states
and
there
was
in
the
case
of
indian
tribes.
this
court
had
decided
in
1867
two
cases
cited
in
our
brief
involving
the
kansas
indians
and
the
new
york
indians,
and
the
court
had
decided
the
cherokee
cases
about
30
years
before
where
there
were
serious
intrusions
on
tribes'
federal
rights
by
states.
so
congress,
when
it
enacted
section
1983,
was
not
only
presumptively
aware
of
those,
but
in
the
1870
committee
report
relied
on
by
the
government,
by
the
senate
judiciary
committee,
specifically
makes
reference
to
the
kansas
indian
case
when
it's
considering
whether
indians
are
citizens
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
when
they're
not.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
that...
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
but,
for
example,
in
the
antitrust
cases,
you've
held
that
states
can
sue
as
plaintiffs.
you've
held
that
foreign
nations
can
sue
as
plaintiffs.
they
can't
be
sued
as
defendants
under
antitrust
statutes.
and
i
think
in
the
vermont
natural
resources
agency
case
on
the
false
claim
act,
you
decided
that
while
a
state
could
not
be
sued
as
a
defendant
under
the
false
claim
act,
that
it
wouldn't
necessarily
preclude
it
from
suing
as
a
plaintiff.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
no,
i'm
not,
justice
scalia.
i'm
trying
to
answer
the
question--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--and...
and
should
have
been
if
it's
going
to
be
pressed
to
this
court.
i...
i
do
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
1331.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
no,
no.
it
arises
under
federal
common
law
when
sovereign
immunity
or
the
right
to
self-government
is
being
pleaded.
and
that's--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--two
cases,
justice
kennedy:
the
national
farmers
union
v.
crow
tribe
and
the
second
oneida
case,
both
in
1985.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
justice
breyer,
the...
the
first
count
in
the
complaint
did
raise
the
right
of
self-governance.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
okay.
well,
i...
i
think
at
least
the...
the
count
did
do
that
and
sovereign
immunity
was
pled
in
the
complaint.
and
then
also,
the
preemptions...
supremacy
clause
issue
that
ms.
mcdowell
was
mentioning
in
the
golden
state
transit,
i
think,
dissent
by
justice
kennedy
cites
gibbons
v.
ogden
and
the
cooley
case
v.
the
port
of
philadelphia,
going
back
into
the
19th
century
for
the
proposition--
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
--i
guess
that's
correct.
i
think
that...
yes,
there
wasn't
federal
question
jurisdiction
in
that
part
of...
of
the
19th
century.
mr.
reid
peyton
chambers
well,
i
certainly
think
in
footnote
27
of
our
brief,
we
cited
a
number
of
indian
cases,
the
chickasaw
case,
the
sac
and
fox
case,
new
mexico
apache
tribe
v.
mescalero,
where
the
court
had
entertained
similar
claims
under
1331.
we're
only
seeking
here
prospective
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
against
the
county,
and
we
only
brought
the
action
when
they
threatened
the
second
search
and
seizure.
we
didn't
do
anything
with
the...
with
the
first
intrusion.
so...
so
i
would
rely
on...
on...
i
mean,
on...
on
the
number
of
cases
where
you
have
allowed
tribes
to
bring
preemption
type
claims
against
states
without
relying
on
section
1983,
though...
though
we
do
believe
the
compensatory
damages
are
appropriate
under
section
1983
also.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
