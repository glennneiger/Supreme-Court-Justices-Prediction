ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
first
like
to
correct
one
misunderstanding
that
the
court
may
have
been
left
with
as
a
result
of
mr.
kirby's
comments.
there
is
no
federal
regulation
or
other
federal
requirement
that
would
have
prevented
the
county
or
the
state
from
sharing
with
the
tribe
the
information,
the
welfare
applications,
and
so
on.
federal--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--in
the
first
place--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
your
honor,
nothing
in
the
position
that's
being
urged
here
would
preclude
a
state
from
proceeding
against
individual
tribal
members
and
searching
their
own--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
and...
and
if
that's
the
case,
they
would
not
need
to
share
the
information
with
the
tribe,
but
they
could
proceed
against
the
individual
tribal
member.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
that's
not
the
case,
justice
breyer.
in
many
instances,
of
course,
if
there
was
a
serious
crime,
it's
a
crime
that
the
federal
government,
as
well
as
the
state,
could
prosecute,
and
there's
no
immunity
bar
to--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--even
in
the
public
law
280
jurisdiction,
justice
o'connor,
because
there
are
federal
statutes,
as
you're
well
aware,
dealing
with
firearms,
narcotics,
racketeering
and
so
on
that
could
often
be
used
in
this
sort
of
situation.
in
addition,
the
federal
government
could
often
bring
the
parties
together
and
try
to
reconcile
these
sorts
of
disagreements.
tribes,
after
all,
are
sovereign
governments.
they
have
a
significant
interest
in
law
enforcement.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
of
course--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
in
the
kiowa
case,
your
honor,
the
court
extended
tribal
sovereign
immunity
to
commercial
off-reservation
activities
of
a
tribe.
the
court
recognized
that
any
limitation
on
tribal
sovereign
immunity
that
would
exclude
a
tribe's
commercial
activities
from
the
protections
of
sovereign
immunity
was
a
task
for
congress
rather
than
for
the
judiciary.
and
it
is
significant
that
when
commercial
activities
of
the
united
states
government,
for
example,
have
been...
when
suit
has
been
allowed
against
such
entities,
it's
been
a
matter
of...
of
statute,
not
a
matter
of
judicial
decision.
indeed,
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
is,
after
all,
a
statutory
protection.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it's
generally
been
understood,
your
honor,
although
not
specifically
addressed
in
a
decision
of
this
court,
that
the
supremacy
clause
and
the
federal
jurisdictional
statutes
provide
a
right
of
action
for
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
when
a
party
is
claiming
that
state
action
is
precluded
by
superseding--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it
may
be
that.
it's...
it's
similar
to
ex
parte
young.
justice
kennedy's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
second
golden
state
transit
case
discusses
this
at...
at
some
length.
also
the
court's
decision
in
shaw
v.
delta
air
lines
provides
a
number
of...
of
citations
to
cases
that
arose
in
this
particular
context.
so
it
is
a
settled,
although
not
frequently
discussed
basis,
of
coming
into
federal
court
to
challenge
state
action.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
think
you're
referring
to
a
situation
where
a
state
would
sue
the
tribe.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
it
has
obtained
a
search
warrant
against
tribal
property.
interestingly
enough,
the
return
of
the
search
warrant
directs
the
tribe
that
if
they
want
the
property
back,
they
will
have
to
come
into
state
court
and
proceed
under
the
california
criminal
code.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no.
that's
not
ex
parte
young.
ex
parte
young
is...
is
based
essentially
on
what
the
court
has
called
the
legal
fiction
that
when
a
state
officer
is
violating
superior
federal
law--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
it
is
when
one
is
considering
the
tribe's
suit
against
the
petitioners.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
the
jurisdictional
basis
is
section
1331,
federal
question
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
from
the
supremacy
clause,
your
honor,
because
the
tribe's
federal
common
law
immunity
supersedes
the
state
enforcement
of
a
state
search
warrant
against
it.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
but
a
search
warrant
is
obtained
in
an
ex
parte
proceeding,
your
honor.
there's
no
opportunity
for--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--no,
you
can't,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
there's
no
procedure
for
that.
and
indeed,
a...
a
party
that
resists
the
search
warrant
may
subject
itself
to
criminal
penalties
for
doing
so.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
so
that's
not
an
optimal
procedure.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
because
the
term
person--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
it...
it
is
not
necessarily
the
case
that
a
tribe
could
not
act
under
state
law,
your
honor,
because,
for
example,
with
jointly
administering--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
correct,
or
it
may
be
acting
under
federal
law.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
generally,
your
honor,
the
court
has
applied
the
interpretive
presumption
that
the
term
person
doesn't
include
a
sovereign.
the
term
person
appears
twice
in
the
same
sentence
in
section
1983,
so
it
would
be
curious
if
it
was
construed
differently.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
that...
that
may
indeed
be
the
case,
your
honor.
in
the
south
carolina
ports
decision
recently,
the
court
recognized
that
the
preeminent
purpose
of
sovereign
immunity
is
to
assure
that
sovereigns
are
treated
with
the
dignity
that
their
sovereign
status
entitles
them.
the
execution
of
a
state
warrant
is
a
particular
threat
to
the
dignity
of
a
sovereign
tribe,
even
more
so
perhaps
than
hauling
it
into
court.
it's
obtained
ex
parte.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
now,
we're
not
saying
that
every
tribal
business
necessarily
is
an
arm
of
the
tribe
for
sovereign
immunity
purposes,
but
the
particular
characteristics...
may
i
finish,
your
honor?
