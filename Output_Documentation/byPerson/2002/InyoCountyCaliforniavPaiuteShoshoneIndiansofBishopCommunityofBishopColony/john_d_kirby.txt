mr.
john
d.
kirby
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
case
the
paiute
propose
and
are
seeking
a
categorical
rule
that
makes
indian
tribes,
their
casinos,
their
commercial
businesses,
and
their
personal
property
immune
from
search
warrants
and
subpoenas
issued
in
connection
with
the
investigation
of
crime
and
the
prosecution
of
crime.
they
seek
this
rule
under
federal
statutory
law,
under
federal
common
law,
and
under
the
constitution.
however,
such
a
categorical
rule
is
not
supported
by
the
text,
structure,
or
history
of
the
constitution,
by
any
federal
statute,
or
by
any
sufficient
or
rational
public
policy.
further,
there
is
not
now,
nor
should
this
court
extend
or
create
a
common
law
right
to
be
immune
from
search
warrants
and
subpoenas
that
are
issued
in
connection
with
the
investigation
of
crime
and
the
prosecution
of
crime.
it
is
a--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--your
honor,
i
am
prepared
to
answer
that
question.
it
does
involve
matters
outside
the
record,
and
i
will
proceed
to
answer.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
there
was
not
any
means
of
solving
it
at
the
time,
your
honor,
because
the
federal
regulations
that
govern
the
public
welfare
act
at
question,
title
45,
part
205,
prohibits
the
information
from
being
disclosed.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
it
is--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
because
the
information
that's
precluded
from
being
distributed
is
the
names
of
the
individuals
who
are
being
investigated.
now,
i
know
that
the
allegation
is
made
that
in
the
letter
that
was
sent
by
the
district
attorney
and
by
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
stated
that
this
was
a
welfare
fraud
investigation.
however,
that
letter
actually
did
not
so
state.
it
stated
that
the
investigation
was
a
confidential
investigation
that
required
the
payroll
information
being
sought.
the
fundamental
right
and
responsibility
of
government
is
to
protect
its
citizens,
and
one
of
the
main
ways
it
does
that,
of
course,
is
through
the
investigation
and
prosecution
of
crime.
the
federal
government
and
the
state
government
have
together
an
integrated
law
enforcement
regime
that
allows
for
search
warrants
and
subpoenas
to
be
executed
and
issued
in
connection
with
the
investigation
of
these
crimes
or
alleged
crimes
whether
the
criminal
conduct
occurs
on
the
reservation
or
off
the
reservation
and
regardless
of
whether
the
evidence
or
proceeds
of
crime
is
thought
to
be
on
the
reservation
or
off
the
reservation.
for
instance,
in
a
public
law
280
state,
such
as
california,
if
there
is
a
crime
committed
off
the
reservation,
frankly
as
well
as
on
the
reservation,
the
federal
government
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
that
crime.
thus,
the
federal
government
does
not
have
the
ability
to
issue
a
search
warrant.
if
the
states
do
not
have
the
ability
to
issue
a
search
warrant
under
those
circumstances
and
there
is
evidence
of
crime
or
proceeds
of
crime
on
the
reservation,
then
that
property
or
evidence
remains
immune
from
law
enforcement.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
yes,
justice
kennedy,
california
is
a
public
law
280
state.
now,
in
a
non-public
law
280
state,
the
same
situation
presents
itself
because
in
that
situation,
the
federal
government
has
the
right
to...
and
the...
the
duty,
if
you
will...
as
a
responsibility
to
its
citizens
to
enforce
the
criminal
law
with
regard
to
crimes
that
occur
on
the
reservation
that
would
be
state
crimes
if
they
occurred
off
the
reservation.
and
under
the
major
crimes
act,
as
well
as
the
general
crimes
act,
the
federal
government
prosecutes
that
crime
and,
of
course,
does
the
investigation
prior
to
prosecution.
in
order
to
conduct
those
activities
and
to
fulfill
that
mission,
if
you
will,
the
federal
government
needs
to
have
the
right
and
does
have
the
right
to
execute
search
warrants
and
to
issue
subpoenas.
now,
as
we
have
seen,
there
may
be
a
situation
where
a
crime
is
committed
on
the
reservation
in
a
public
law
280
state
and
a
crime
committed
in
a...
the
same
crime
in
a
non-public
law
280
state,
and
in
those
situations,
there
must
be
parity
with
regard
to
the
law
enforcement
regime.
if
not,
what
we
end
up
with
is
gaps
in
the
criminal
justice
system,
and
that
wasn't
the
intent
of
the
legislature
in
enacting
public
law
280.
as
the
court
will
recall,
public
law
280
was
passed
by
congress
because
of
a
perceived
lawlessness
on
certain
reservations.
that
lawlessness
arose
because
congress
felt
that
the
federal
government...
due
to
the
vast
distances,
if
you
will,
of
federal
government
law
enforcement
agencies,
and
the
lack
of
density
of
those
agencies...
simply
wasn't
able
to
enforce
criminal
laws
throughout
the
vast
acreage
of
reservations.
and
so--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--yes,
your
honor.
the
search
warrant
was
issued
as
to
tribal
property.
i...
i
would
point
out
that
the
search
warrant
itself
didn't
actually
require
the
tribe
to
do
anything
other
than
stand
by
and
allow
the
officers
to
go
forth
and
search.
and
in
this--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
yes,
your
honor,
the
point
being...
the
point
being
that
the
search
warrant
did
not
hail
the
reservation
or
the
tribe
into
court
for
the
purpose
of
responding
to
a
civil
judgment
for
the
purpose
of--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--it
was
common
payroll
records,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
they
were
records
of
the
commercial
business
operated
there,
yes,
the
casino.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
your
honor,
they
were
kept
in
back
of
the
casino,
as
i
understand
it,
in
an
outbuilding
that
was
secured
by
a
padlock.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
yes,
justice
scalia,
there
could
very
well
be
a
distinction
there.
and
the
solution
that
we
believe
would
address
that
distinction
would
be
a
solution
that
justice
white
presented
in
the
brendale
decision
when
he
talked
about
a
tribe
having
a
unique
protectable
interest
in
certain
situations.
and
the
tribe
ought
to
have
a
right
to
go
to
court...
in
this
case,
it
would
be
a
state
court...
to
present
that
protectable
interest
so
that
a...
an
interest-balancing
assessment
can
be
accomplished.
in
this
case
the
interest
of
the
tribal
record
may
very
well
outweigh
a
minimal
interest
of
the
state
if
it
was
a
simple
minor
misdemeanor.
on
the
other
hand,
it
may
be
that
if
it's
a
large
serious
felony
of
multiple
murder
and
there
is
very
direct
evidence
in
the
records
of
the
tribal
government,
perhaps
under
those
facts
the
court
may
find
that
the
interest
weighed
in
favor
of
the
state's
police
power.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
no.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
no,
justice
scalia,
and
no,
justice
kennedy.
what
would
happen
would
be
once
the
probable
cause
determination
is
made
that
there
is
evidence
of
a
crime
within
the
records
of
the
casino
in
our
hypothetical,
the
search
warrant
would
be
executed
and
the
property
would
be
seized
and
brought
before
the
court.
at
that
time
the
tribe,
if
it
thought
it
had
a
protectable
interest
under
state
statute,
perhaps
because
of
certain
statutory
privileges,
or
under
some
special
protectable
interest
that
the
tribe
may
feel
that
it
has
because
of
its
unique
domestic
dependent
sovereign
status,
could
present
that
interest
balance
analysis
to
the
magistrate
immediately.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
with
all
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
it's
the
best
remedy
available.
the
tribe's
desire
to
have
a
categorical
rule
that
no
search
warrants
may
be
issued
with
regard
to
its
property
has
disastrous
consequences
when
evidence
or
proceeds
of
a
crime
is
located
upon
the
reservation.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
your
honor,
the
federal
regulation
prohibits
the--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--no,
justice
breyer.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
well,
justice
breyer,
looking
at
the
situation
that
you've
presented,
which
is
our
situation,
one
must
remember
that
letters
were
sent
by
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
to
the
three
individuals
asking
for
a
reconciliation.
letters
were
sent
by
the
district
attorney
to
these
same
three
individuals.
two
letters
were
sent
to
the
tribe
asking
for
the
information,
which
the
tribe
had
honored
five
times
in
the
last
approximately
2
years,
and
the
tribe
had
actually
in
one
of
those
occasions
asked
for
a
search
warrant,
which
it
then
honored.
there
was
a
history
of
working
with
the
tribe
to
obtain
this
information.
during
this
circumstance,
the
tribe
took
the
position
it
was
no
longer
going
to
do
that.
it
wanted
to
have
something
more,
and
in
fact
the
tribal
attorney
suggested
that
a
search
warrant
be
obtained.
and
as
it
had
been
in
another
circumstance
within
the
preceding
12
months.
so
there
is
a
clear
history
of
trying
to
work
with
the
tribe.
what
ended
up
happening
in
this
case
is
what
could
happen
in
any
case.
the
tribe,
for
whatever
reason,
depending
upon
whatever
tribal
government
might
have
been
elected
at
the
time...
and
it...
they
may
have
been
different
on
that
day
than
they
were
during
the
preceding
2
years...
decided,
no,
we're
not
going
to
do
that
any
longer.
and
that's
how
this
situation
came
to
fruition.
and
what
we're
looking
at--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--justice
o'connor,
that
was
done
on
at
least
two
separate
occasions.
letters
were
sent
to
each
of
the
three
casino
employees
advising
them
of
the
discrepancy
and
asking
that
the
employees
come
in
and
reconcile
the
discrepancy.
those
letters,
unfortunately,
were
ignored.
and
so
the
county
was
faced
with
the
situation
where
it
is
mandated
to
have
such
an
investigation
process
into
potential
fraud
by
the--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
that
could
be
done.
that
presumes,
however,
that
the
tribal
officials
would
subject
themselves
and
submit
to
questioning
and
providing
the
information
verbally
that
they
have
refused
to
provide
in
writing
simply
by
filling
out
a
form
requesting
the
information.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
justice
o'connor,
when
property
is
at
issue,
we
have
an
in
rem
situation
that
doesn't
require
a
lawsuit.
we
have
the...
i
believe
it's
minnesota
and
the
cass
county
case
which--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--i
apologize.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
not
to
differ
or
to
draw
hairs,
yes,
the
suit
could
be
filed
and
if
the
tribe
consented
to
jurisdiction,
then
we
could
resolve
it
in
court.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
not
against
its
consent.
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
that
is
my
understanding,
justice
scalia,
and
that
is
the
case
we
have
here.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
that
would
certainly
be
a
resolution
of
this
case,
justice
souter.
however,
what
we're
left
with
dealing
today
without
congressional
action
is
the
common
law
tribal
immunity
doctrine
as
set
forth
by
this
court
and
the
montana
analysis
that
this
court
has
set
forth
with
regard
to--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
yes,
justice
scalia,
it
is.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
initially--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--i
believe
that
the
tribal
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
commenced
with
the
turner
decision
which
was
approximately
1919.
and
as
this
court
indicated
in
the
kiowa
decision,
that
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
was
created
almost
by
accident.
it
was--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--worcester
v.
georgia,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
souter,
dealt
with
primarily
treaty
rights
and
the...
the
need
for
justice
marshall
to
try
to...
to
put,
if
you
will,
or
place
the
tribes
who
were
nation...
independent
nations,
sovereigns
of
this
country,
into
some
category
that
was
different
from
nation
states.
our
constitution
recognizes
that
indian
tribes
are
not
nation...
foreign
nation
states.
in
the
commerce
clause,
we
speak
to
the
interstate
commerce
clause
as
states
being
one
type
of
entity,
indian
tribes
being
another,
and
foreign
nations
being
another.
so
tribes
have
always
been
considered
differently.
and
here
they
are
domestic
dependent
sovereigns
which
has
characteristics
totally
different
from
foreign
nation
states.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
well,
justice
breyer,
congress
certainly
has
plenary
power
over
indian
tribes.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
justice
breyer,
with
all
respect,
yes,
you
are
wrong.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
in
my
opinion
we
have
to
adopt
a...
first
of
all,
we
cannot
adopt
a
categorical
rule
that
the
tribes
propose.
so
what
we
are
looking
for
is
a
solution
that
is
acceptable
to
certainly
the
majority
of
the
court--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--it
has
not
been
argued
below,
justice
breyer.
however,
that's
not
the
distinction
that
we're
making
between
commercial
and
governmental
activity
because,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
if
the
government
minutes,
if
you
will,
the
tribal
minutes,
have
direct
evidence
of
a
very
serious
felony
for
whatever
reason--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--a
balancing
interest,
your...
justice
breyer.
and
i
believe
that--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--under
the
younger
abstention
doctrine...
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
we'd
be
happy
to
win
this
case
on
that
ground,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
mr.
john
d.
kirby
the
casino
is
operated
through
a
corporation
that
is
chartered
by
the
tribe,
not
by
the
state.
so
the
tribe
has
certain
policies
wherein
it
blesses
an
organization
as
a...
as
a
tribal
corporation.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
justice
rehnquist,
i
see
that
my
time
is
drawing
to
a
close.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
and
perhaps
address
that
in
reply.
mr.
john
d.
kirby
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
address
very
briefly
the
flip
side,
if
you
will,
of
the
categorical
rule
being
proposed
by
the
tribe
and
the
problems
with
that.
and
that
flip
side
involves
not
the
police
power
of
the
state,
which
we
have
already
talked
about,
but
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
defendant
who
is
faced
with
criminal
prosecution
in
a
state
court
when
that
defendant
feels
there
is
exculpatory
evidence
in
the
possession
of
the
tribe.
for
instance,
it
may
be
a
video
surveillance
of
the
parking
lot
or
whatnot
that
shows
perhaps
a
self-defense
defense
for
this
particular
person.
under
the
tribe's
rule--
mr.
john
d.
kirby
--it
doesn't
necessarily
need
to
be
a
tribal
member
who
might
be
a
criminal
defendant,
justice
ginsburg.
it
could
be
anyone,
a
non-tribal
member
or
even
a
patron,
who
feels
that
there
is
exculpatory
evidence
that
the
tribe
possesses.
and
under
the
sixth
amendment,
that
person
has
the
right
to
have
the
state
issue
compulsory
process
to
obtain
that
exculpatory
evidence.
under
the
tribe's
rule
that's
being
proposed,
the
tribe
would
have
the
ability
to
trump
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
the
accused
in
that
situation
and
not
produce
the
exculpatory
evidence.
the
tribe
would
also
have
the
right
to
trump
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
to
a
fair
trial
of
that
particular
person.
and
that's
the
flip
side
of
the
categorical
rule
that's
being
proposed
and
why
we
believe
it's
another
reason
it
should
not
be
adopted
by
this
court.
with
regard
to
the
1983
action,
i
would
like
to
say
that
not
only
is
the
tribe
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
the
interpretive
presumption
that
this
court
has
set
forth
in,
i
believe,
the
vermont
agency
it
was
acknowledged.
but
also
the
right
that
the
tribe
is
asserting,
the
right
to
self-governance,
is
not
a
federal
statutory
right
and
it's
not
a
constitutional
right,
and
as
such,
it
cannot
support
a
1983
action.
and
that
is
another
reason
why
1983
provides
no
relief
for
the
tribe
in
this
case.
in...
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
say
that
this
case
does
not
implicate
traditional
sovereign
immunity
which
is
sovereign
immunity
from
civil
suit.
and
there
was
a
question
raised
with
regard
to
that,
i
believe
by
justice
scalia,
pointing
out
that
the
tribe's
treasury
is
not
at
issue
here.
it's
not
at
stake
here.
what
we're
dealing
with
is
process,
in
this
case
the
criminal
process
of
the
court.
and
that's
a
totally
different
situation.
this
court
has
never
addressed
criminal
process
as
being
subject
to
tribal
immunity.
all
of
this
court's
decisions
have
addressed
the
tribe's
immunity
to
civil
lawsuit.
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
the
doctrine
of
tribal
immunity
should
not
be
extended
in
this
case
to
include
criminal
process
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
set
forth.
while
there
may
not
be
any
wholly
satisfactory
result,
justice
breyer,
we
believe
that
our
position
is
the
best
position.
even
if
one
has
to
choose
between
either
of
the
two
categorical
approaches,
simply
even
looking
at
the
rights
of
an
accused
and
compulsory
process,
that
should
mitigate
toward
the
county's
position
here.
we've
also
suggested
a
procedure,
as
presented
by
justice
white
in
brendale,
as
being
a
potential
resolution
of
this
problem,
maintaining
the
dignity
of
the
tribe
and
also
allowing
the
state
to
exercise
its
police
power
and
protect
its
citizens
as
it
investigates
and
prosecutes
crime.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
