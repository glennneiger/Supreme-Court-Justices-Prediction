justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
there
one
difference?
and
that
is,
take
the
foreign
sovereign
situation.
there's
a
statute
of
the
united
states.
and...
and
if
we
start
with
the
assumption,
as
i
do,
that
we
are
in
a
different
situation
from...
from
what
we
faced
in
hicks
so
that
we're
talking
about,
in
effect,
a
claim
directly
against
the...
the
sovereign
itself,
and
if
we
also
assume,
which
i
think
is
correct,
that
the
ultimate
party
in
interest
in
this
kind
of
a
welfare
fraud
situation
is
the
united
states,
why
isn't
the
sensible
answer
to
say,
all
right,
if
the
united
states
wants
the
tribes
to
be
treated
like
foreign
sovereigns
in
a
commercial
enterprise,
and
if
the
united
states
wants
to
regard
the
casinos
as
a
commercial
enterprise
for
that
purpose,
let
it
pass
a
statute
comparable
to
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
in
fact--
--well,
isn't...
isn't
it
also
a...
a
creation
which
basically
was
an
adoption
of
an
international
law
norm?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
what
john
marshall
thought
he
was
doing?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
did
i.
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
there
a
problem
on
an
ex
parte
young
theory
here?
i
mean,
you're...
we're
not...
they're
not
simply
asking
the
tribe
to
stop
doing
something
that's
unlawful
by
going
against
the
officer
who
does
it.
they
are
asking
for
tribal
property.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they...
that's
what's
going
on.
the...
the
county
here
wants
tribal
property,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
that
ex
parte
young?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
so...
so
ex
parte
young
isn't
going
to
cover
a
situation
like
that.
i
mean,
an
ex
parte
young
analog
in
this
situation
isn't
going
to
cover
the...
the
request
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
would
it
include
the
tribe?
and
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
include
foreign
governments.
we
said
a
couple
of
years
ago
paraguay
couldn't
bring
a
1983
suit.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no.
sure,
it
was...
it
was
late
in
the
day
for
capital
punishment.
we
were
deciding
a...
a
question
of...
of
the
meaning
of
section
1983,
and
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
good
for
your
case
too.
