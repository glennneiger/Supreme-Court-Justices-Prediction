that
goes
for...
they
had
asked
for
edited
copies.
they
just
wanted
the
last
page,
and
they
said
that
they
could
be
edited.
does
the...
in
your
view
didn't
federal
regulations
preclude
even
those
edited
copies
of
just
the
last
page
from
being
turned
over?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
good
did
it
do
to
the
state...
to
the
tribe
after
the
horse
is
out
of
the
barn?
in
other
words,
the
state...
the
tribe
is
not
being
prosecuted
for
anything
in
these
cases.
it's
a
tribal
member
who's
being
prosecuted.
and
if
you're
saying,
well,
the...
the
warrant
has
to
be
executed
but
after
the
fact
the
state...
the
tribe,
to...
to
ease
its
wounded
feelings,
can
have
this
declaration?
i
don't
follow
it.
i
mean,
the
tribe's
idea
is
there
is
no
right
to
come
on
our
property
and
seize
our
records.
if
you're
saying
every
time
the
county
can
do
that
and
that
all
the
tribe
has
is
an
after-the-fact
determination
by
some
magistrate
that
the
county
was
wrong,
it's
not
much
of
a
remedy,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
worcester
v.
georgia?
i
thought
that
the...
the
tribal
sovereign
immunity
began
long
before
19-something.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
there
was
a
dissent
in
that
case
that
made
the
point
that
justice
scalia
has
been
pursuing.
i'd
like
to
back
up
and
find
out
how
we
got
here.
this
is
a
suit
brought
by
the
tribe,
not
by
the
county,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
think
you
are
urging
that
1983
is
not
available--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
the
tribe
either
as
plaintiff
or
defendant.
if
1983
is
not
available,
then
what
is
the
basis?
what
statute
does
the
tribe's
case
arise
under
for
the
substantive
determination
that
you
would
like
to
have
the
court
adjudicate?
if
we
don't
have
1983,
what
federal
law
does
the
case
arise
under?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
it's
a
kind
of
bivens
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
surely
the
federal
law
that
the
case
arises
under
is
not
1331
itself.
you
have
to
have
another
law,
and
the
one
exception
to
that
is
on
the
federal
side
when
the
court
created
the
bivens
action
because
congress
had
not
enacted
a
statute
like
1983
to
cover
federal
offices.
but
you
seem
to
be
asking
us
to
create
another
such
category
where
there's
some
right
of
action
implied
from
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
aren't
you
relying
on
kiowa
county?
because
that
was
as
commercial
as
a
deal
could
be
and
the
court
said
no
sovereign
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
why
didn't
it
happen
on
your
side?
i
would
like
to
ask
a
question
of
the
same
nature
that
justice
o'connor
asked
the
county.
these
were
employees
of
the
casino.
they
had
twice
received
notices
from
the
county
saying,
here's
the
payroll
thing,
what
it
says
you've
got,
and
here
is
the
welfare
payment
you
received.
would
you
please
reconcile
these?
and
the
employees
didn't
respond,
didn't
respond
twice.
and
so
the
county
comes
to
the
employer,
the
casino,
and
says,
help
us
out.
these
people...
i
guess
we
could
lock
them
up,
but
we
would
prefer
just
to
have
you
give
us
the
records
that
will
enable
us
to
determine
whether
there
was
welfare
cheating.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
the
tribe
did
not
know
that
this
investigation
pertained
to
welfare
fraud?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kirby
said
there
was
some
federal
regulation
that
blocked
that
and
then
ms.
mcdowell
told
us
that
there
is
no
such
regulation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
individuals
don't
have
the
records.
the...
the
tribe
does
have
the
payroll
records.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
question
were
the
casino
didn't
file
whatever
was
required,
the
state...
whatever
payroll
reports
it
was
required
to
report
to
the
state.
so
it's
the
tribe's
default.
and
the
state
now
wants
to
enforce
the
requirement
that...
that
all
employers
in
the
state
file
certain
records
about
their
employees.
could
the
state,
which
could
go
after
any
other
operation
that
fails
to
file
required
papers,
go
after
the
tribe?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but
you
agree,
i
think,
that
the
tribe
is
not
suable.
under...
as
a
defendant,
the
tribe
is
not
amenable
to
1983
as
a
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
what
is
county's
jurisdictional
basis?
and
don't
tell
me
1331
because
it
has
to
arise
under
some
law
other
than
1331.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
mean
the
counties.
i
mean
the
tribe.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what...
the
federal
question
jurisdiction
you're
saying
is
federal
common
law.
anything
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
odd
for
you
to
be
raising
a
tribal
member
as
a
defendant
when
you
have
potential
tribal
members
here
who
might
be
subject
to
suit.
you
seem
a
strange
champion
for
such
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
stems
from
a
california
county's
investigation
of
three
members
of
a
native
american
tribe
for
alleged
welfare
fraud.
the
four
suspects
were
on
the
payroll
of
a
tribe-run
casino.
in
pursuit
of
the
investigation,
the
county
sought
access
to
the
casino's
employment
records.
the
tribe
refused
the
county's
request
for
access
explaining
that
it's
privacy
policy
prohibited
release
of
payroll
records
without
the
employee's
consent.
on
showing
probable
cause,
the
county
then
obtained
and
executed
a
state
court
warrant
that
authorize
search
of
the
casino
for
the
requested
employment
records.
to
avoid
further
searches
of
a
similar
kind,
the
tribe
sued
the
county
in
federal
court
asserting
federally
protected
sovereign
immunity
from
state
court
processes.
the
tribe
sought
money
damages
and
other
relief
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983,
a
federal
statute
that
permits
persons
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
to
sue
in
federal
or
state
court
for
alleged
deprivations
of
federally
protected
rights.
the
tribe
lost
in
the
district
court
but
prevailed
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
our
review
of
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
centers
on
the
question
whether
the
tribe
qualifies
as
a
person
entitled
to
sue
under
1983.
the
parties
agree
and
we
assume
that
a
native
american
tribe,
like
a
state
of
the
union
is
not
a
person
subject
to
sue
under
1983.
we
hold
that
in
the
circumstances
this
case
presents,
the
tribe
fails
to
qualify
as
a
claimant,
a
person
authorized
to
sue
on
the
1983.
qualification
of
a
sovereign
as
a
person
who
may
maintain
a
claim
for
relief,
we
have
explained
in
other
context
depends
not
upon
their
analysis
of
the
word
"person"
but
on
the
legislative
environment
in
which
the
word
appears.
there
is
in
this
case,
no
allegation
that
the
county
lacked
probable
cause
to
search
the
casino's
employment
records
or
that
the
warrant
executed
by
the
county
was
otherwise
defective.
it
is
only
by
virtue
of
the
tribe's
sovereign
status
that
it
claims
immunity
from
the
county's
processes.
section
1983
was
designed
to
secure
private
rights
against
government
encroachment.
thus,
the
county
acknowledges
a
tribal
member
complaining
of
an
alleged
unlawful
search
would
be
a
person
qualify
to
sue
under
1983,
but
1983
was
not
designed
to
advance
a
sovereign's
prerogative
to
withhold
evidence
relevant
in
a
criminal
investigation.
accordingly,
we
hold
that
the
tribe
may
not
sue
under
1983
to
vindicate
the
sovereign
right
it
here
claims.
in
addition
to
1983,
the
tribe
invokes
the
federal
common
law
of
indian
affairs,
but
the
tribe
has
not
explained
in
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
have
not
carefully
considered
the
key
question,
just
what
prescriptions
of
federal
common
law,
if
any,
enable
a
tribe
to
seek
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
establishing
its
sovereign
right
to
be
free
from
state
criminal
processes.
we
therefore
remand
the
case
for
resolution
of
that
jurisdictional
question.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
