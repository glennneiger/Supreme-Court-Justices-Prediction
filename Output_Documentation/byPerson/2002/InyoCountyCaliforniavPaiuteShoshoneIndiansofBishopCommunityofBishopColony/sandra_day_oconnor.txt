counsel,
did
the
tribe
offer
to
accept
as
consent
by
the
employees
their
employment
forms?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
see.
i
just
thought
it
was
a
little
curious
that
if
some
means
of
solving
this
had
been
offered,
why
we're
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
have
other
means
to
get
the
information?
can
you
question
the
people
you
suspect
of
welfare
fraud
and
ask
them
how
much
they
earned,
if
anything?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
presumably
you
could
question
supervisory
employees
who
prepare
payroll
records
and
ask
them
how
much
have
you
paid
these
people,
if
anything.
could
you
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
have
said
that
the...
in
minnesota
v.
the
united
states,
i
think
we
said
that
a
proceeding
against
property
in
which
the
united
states
has
an
interest
is
a
suit
against
the
united
states.
do
you
take
the
position
that
you
can
file
a
suit
against
the
indian
tribe
without
its
consent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
didn't
answer
my
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
you
can
file
a
suit
against
the
tribe?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but...
against
its
consent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
280
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
chambers,
you...
the
tribe
filed
this
suit
under
section
1983.
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
one
of
the
questions
we
have
to
answer
is
whether
the
tribe
is
a
person
under
section
1983.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i...
i
would
appreciate
it
if
you
would
address
that
point
because
the
interpretive
presumption
is
that
the
tribe,
as
a
sovereign,
which
you're
so
strongly
urging
here,
is
not
a
person
under
section
1983.
why
should
we
recognize
that
it's
covered
as
a
person
under
section
1983?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
doesn't
include
states?
