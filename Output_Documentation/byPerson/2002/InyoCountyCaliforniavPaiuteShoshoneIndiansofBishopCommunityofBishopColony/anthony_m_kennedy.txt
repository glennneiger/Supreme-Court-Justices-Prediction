justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
california
one
of
the
280
states
that
has
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
it
that
the
local
magistrate
in
each
case
has
to...
and
then
the
law
enforcement
officer
weigh
these
interests?
well,
this
is
a
misdemeanor.
well,
this
is
a
felony.
i...
i
don't...
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
rule
to
implement
in
practice.

mr.
kirby--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
do
you
want
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
even
so,
let's
assume
there's
a
serious
felony
having
been
committed
involving
a
crime
of
violence
where
employees
of
the
casino
are
implicated.
surely,
the
district
attorney's
office
or
the
county
is
not
going
to
share
that
information
with...
necessarily
with...
with
the
whole
tribal
council.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
seems...
that
seems
to
me
a
very
disruptive
proposal
for...
for
orderly
law
enforcement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
the
suggestion
was
that
there'd
be
a
lot
of
cooperation
between
the
tribes.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
may
compromise
a
very
serious
criminal
investigation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if...
if
what
was
formerly
tribal
government
has
now
been
so
infused
with
a
commercial
character,
that
it
seems
to
me
calls
tribal
immunity
into
question
generally.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it...
but
it
has
jurisdiction
over
individuals
who
by
hypothesis
either
in
this
case
or
some
hypothetical
case
might
be
given...
might
be
being...
being
sheltered
by
the
tribe.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
didn't
the
tribe--
--we're...
we're
talking
about
hypothetical
instances--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--as
to
how
this...
as
to
how
this
rule
that
you
advocate
would
apply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your...
and
your
best
citation
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--those
came
up
out
of
state
courts,
though.
they
didn't
come
up
through
the
federal
system.
