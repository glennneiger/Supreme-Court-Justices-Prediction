chief

may
i
ask,
speaking
of
that...
that
question,
does
the
tribe
itself
operate
the
casino
or
does
it
operate
it
through
a
corporation
of
some
kind?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your...
your
petition
raises
three
questions,
and
so
far,
due
to
no
fault
of
your
own,
you've
only
covered
one
of
them.
do
you
want
to
try
to
get
to

two

are
you
mr.
peyton
chambers

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you
say
essential
government
records,
but
these
are
basically
commercial
records,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
tribe
were
operating
a
trading
post,
would
it
be
different?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
mean
we
should
just
go
wild
construing
it
for
that
reason?

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
chambers.
