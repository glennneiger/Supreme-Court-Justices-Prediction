what...
what
was
the
tribal
property
at
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
were
they
records
of
the
casino?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
were
they
kept?
were
they
kept
at
the
casino?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you...
would
you
draw
a
distinction
between
the
subpoena
of
the
records
of
the
commercial
operation
and
a
subpoena
of
the
records
of
the...
of
the
government
records
of
the
tribe
itself?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
everybody
do?
sort
of
stand
around
until
the
appeal
is
finally
exhausted--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
a
couple
of
years
to
see
whether
they
can
do
the
search
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kirby,
isn't
it
the
case
that...
that
you
can
sue...
the
united
states
can
be
sued
against
its...
against
its
consent
if
it's
operating
a
commercial
enterprise.
isn't
that
the
international
law
of
sovereign
immunity,
just
as
under
our
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
a
foreign
sovereign
can
be
sued
in
this
country
against
its
will
if
it
is
operating
a
commercial
enterprise?
justice
antonin
scalia
has
congress
ever
adopted
a
statute
speaking
to
tribal
sovereign
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
entirely
a
creation
of
this
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
want
to
do
it
the
hard
way.
i
mean,
the...
you
win
this
case
if
we
say
you
can
subpoena
the
commercial...
the
records
of
a
commercial
enterprise
being
run
by
the
tribe,
but
you
don't
want
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
ms.
mcdowell,
let's
talk
about
their
being
sovereign.
i
had
thought
that
we...
that
our
cases
make
very
clear
that
their
sovereignty
is
a
peculiar
and
lesser
kind
of
sovereignty.
it
is
certainly...
does
not
exceed
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
or
of
foreign
countries.
and
i...
i
am
perplexed
at
why...
why
the
united
states
wants
to
accord
the...
the
tribe's
commercial
enterprises
greater
protection
than
is
accorded
to
england
or...
or
germany
or
any...
any
foreign
sovereign--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
suit
is
allowed.
and
i'm
sure
in
the
course
of
suit,
you
can
subpoena
documents
relating
to
that...
to
that
commercial
enterprise.
why
should
we...
and
that
provision
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
was
simply
a
reflection
of
what
the
international
norm
had
become.
now,
why
in
the
world
should
we
accord
greater
protection
to
this
lesser
sovereignty
that...
that
consists
of
the
indian
tribe?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
such
an
obvious
way
to
raise
this
kind
of
issue
without
that.
the
next
time
somebody
wants
something
from
the
tribe,
they
say
no,
make
them
go
to
court
and
appeal
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
can't
you
just
resist
a
search
warrant
and
say,
no,
i
think
it's
an
unlawful
warrant
and
go
right
to
the
state
court
and
appeal
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
everybody
just
has
to
follow
this.
there's
no
procedure
to
resist--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that's
so
when...
when
what
you're
doing
is
getting
the
records
of
a
casino?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
this...
what
you're
saying
is
true
of
all--
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
you're
sure
that
it
doesn't
own...
what
does
it
do?
what...
you
say
it
doesn't
own
the
land.
it
doesn't
own
the
slot
machines.
what...
what
does
it
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
fortiori
for
you
i
would
think.
i
would
think
that
the
difference
in
kiowa
is...
is...
it
seems
to
me
one...
one
might
say
when
the
money
is
coming...
when
money
is
sought
that
comes
out
of
the
tribal
treasury,
we're
not...
we're
not
willing
to
take
into
account
the
commercial
nature
of
the
enterprise.
it's
still
coming
out
of
the
tribal
treasury.
but
this
is
quite
a
different
matter.
nothing
comes
out
of
the
tribal
treasury.
and
you're...
you're
just
seeking
documents
that
belong
to
the
commercial
enterprise
essentially.
i...
i
don't
know
that
kiowa
necessarily
covers
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
so
what's
your
suggestion
on
this
point?
that...
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
have
is
an
instance
where
perhaps
both
sides
feel
the
other
was
being
very
unreasonable,
but
something
that
should
have
been
worked
out.
and...
and
so
because
you
couldn't
work
it
out,
one
way
to
work
it
out
would
be
get
the
federal
government
involved,
but
it
couldn't
be
worked
out.
so
now
we're
in
a
position
of
either
having
to
say
no
matter
how
unreasonable
the
tribe
is
in
stopping
the
state
from
getting
evidence
of
a
serious
crime,
well,
that's...
the
tribe
wins,
or
saying
no
matter
how
unreasonable
the
state
is
in
trying
to
interfere
with
the
activities
of
the
tribe,
they
win.
now,
to
me
quite
honestly,
neither
of
those
solutions
is
satisfactory.
do
we
have
to
choose
the
one
or
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
have
to
choose,
why
wouldn't
i
just
say,
if
i'm
trying
to
look
for
a
compromise
that
preserves
the
essence
of
it,
very
well,
if
i
have
to
choose
between
two
imaginary,
unreasonable
warring
parties,
i
will
say
that
where
it's
commercial,
the
tribe
loses;
where
it's
noncommercial,
the
tribe
wins.
what's
wrong
with
that,
which
is
where
we
started?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
those...
those
agreements
may
be
prompted
by
at
least
the
uncertainty
of
what
would
happen
if
they
didn't
make
an
agreement.
i
mean,
we
don't
know
that
those
agreements
aren't
prompted
in
part
by
the
uncertainty
as
to
whether,
if
there
were
not
an
agreement,
the
state
couldn't
come
in
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
chambers,
i
thought
your...
your
first
position
on
this
issue
was
that
it
was
not
raised
below.
you
raised
that
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition.
are
you
abandoning
that
now?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand
that.
but
you...
but...
but
you
didn't
mention
a
thing
about
it,
and
it
was
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition.
it
was
also
in
your
brief.
you
claim
that
the
1983
issue
was
not
raised
below.
