justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
why
is
that?
i
mean,
from
what
you've
said
so
far,
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
the
state
or
the
county
went
to
the
tribe
and
said,
we
want
your
records,
and
the
tribe
said,
why?
and
the
county
said,
we
can't
tell
you.
well,
obviously
that
would
be
a
situation
where
they
might
get
their
backs
up.
but
suppose
you
just
said,
look,
the
reason
is
that
we
think
there
are
a
couple
of
people
here
who
are
cheating
us.
we
think
they
get
welfare
from
us
and
you're
paying
them
too
much.
that's
why
we
want
to
look
at
it.
maybe
they
would
have
said,
sure,
go
look
at
it.
but
i
take
it
you
couldn't
do
that
simple
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
then
isn't
the
solution
that
maybe
you
need
a
law
to
overcome
the
federal
regulation
or
maybe
you
just
go
to
a
federal
official
and
say,
will
you
please
ask
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
no
way
to
do
it.
in
other
words,
under
the
law
the
only
choice...
your
major
constitutional
thing
is
you
have
to
say
the
only
possibility
is
the
county
that
wants
to
prosecute
somebody
has
to...
goes
to
the
tribe
and
says,
we
want
to
prosecute
somebody.
we
won't
tell
you
who.
we
can't
tell
you
why.
give
us
all
your
records.
i
mean,
on
that
circumstance,
i'd
think
the
tribe
would
certainly
have
a
point.
and
yet...
yet
if...
if
you
were
behaving
reasonably
and
maybe...
maybe
if
federal
law
prevents
you
from
behaving
reasonably,
maybe
they
should
change
it.
how
is
this
supposed
to
work
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
we
will
hear
in
about
a
minute,
if
we
get
to
the
main
issue
of
this,
i
suspect...
you
see,
on
the
one
hand
if
we
decide
in
your
favor,
that
means
that
any
magistrate
in
the
state,
of
which
there
may
be
many,
in
any
criminal
case
whatsoever
for
probable
cause
can
allow
state
officials
to
go
into
all
the
tribal
documents
no
matter
how
many
there
are,
no
matter
how
related
to
government
of
the
tribe,
whatever
they
are.
they're
most...
they're
most
key
matters
for
the
tribe's
governance.
but
if
we
decide
against
you,
all
it
means
is
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
federal
government
and
convince
them
that
this
is
really
important
and
then
they'll
deal
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
thinking
of
congress.
i'm
saying
right
now...
you
go
to
the
interior
department.
they
have
people
there.
you
go
tell
them
what
the
problem
is,
and
they
say...
you
say,
this
tribe
is
being
totally
unreasonable
here,
completely.
i
don't
know
why
but
they
are.
and...
and
if
they
feel
it's
important
that
the
federal
government
now
has
adequate
ways
of
getting
you
the
information
you
need.
now...
now
am
i
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
no
way.
in
other
words,
it's
just
we're
at
a...
at
a
loss.
either...
either...
we'd
have
to
get
legislation,
in
your
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you...
it's
acceptable
to
you.
you
say
commercial...
if
it's
a
commercial
body
like
a
casino,
that's...
they
don't
have
the
immunity,
but
if
it's
noncommercial,
it's
okay.
but
has
this
been
argued
below
whether
they're
commercial
or
noncommercial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
the
distinction
you
would
be
making
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
but...
no,
the
problem
that
he's
trying
to
put...
imagine
the
most
serious
crime
you
can
think
of
committed
off
the
reservation
by
people
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
indian
tribe,
for
example,
but
there
is
a
key
piece
of
evidence
that
is
there
in
the
tribal
document
and
they
want
to
get
it.
now,
what
we've
just
been
told
is
there...
they
can't...
if...
if
we
decide
for
the
tribe,
there's
no
way
whatsoever
they
can
get
it.
it's
impossible.
if
the
tribe
refuses
to
cooperate,
the
federal
government
can
do
nothing
without
new
laws
being
passed.
now,
is
all
that
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
there...
it's
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
that
different
from
any
foreign
country
that
wholly
owns
a
corporation
engaged
in...
in
business?
for
any
foreign
country,
when
it
owns
such
a
corporation,
all
the
revenue,
all
the
profits
go
to
the
treasury
of
the
foreign
country
to
be
used
for
the
public
benefit.
at
least
where
that
is
the
case,
i
think
that
the
sovereign
immunity
turns
on
the
nature
of
the
operation,
not
on
whether
the
revenues
go
to
the
benefit
of
the
people
of
the
country.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they're
all
for...
well,
what
is...
so
tell
me
precisely
what
is
the
difference
between
the
casino
and,
let's
say,
the
state
of...
the
government
of
finland
which
happens
to
own
a
shipping
business
100
percent
and
the
revenues
and
profits
from
that
shipping
business
go
entirely
to
health
care,
parks,
other
things
for
the
people
of
finland.
now,
what's
the
difference
between
our
finnish
shipping
line
and
the
casino
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
the
injunctive
relief...
i
looked
at
the
declaratory
relief
in
the
complaint
and
it
didn't
seem
really
directly
on
point.
the...
the
request
for
declaratory
relief
had
to
do
with
the
gaming
act,
law
280,
compacts,
et
cetera.
so
they
didn't
seem
really
to
raise
the
question
we
now
have.
then
there's
a
section
on
damages,
which
is
1983,
and
then
some
requests
for
injunctive
relief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
the
first
request
for
relief.
the
requests
for
relief...
there
are
five,
and
the
first
two
have
to
do
with
the
declaratory
judgment.
i
think
they're
not
right
on
this
point,
but--
