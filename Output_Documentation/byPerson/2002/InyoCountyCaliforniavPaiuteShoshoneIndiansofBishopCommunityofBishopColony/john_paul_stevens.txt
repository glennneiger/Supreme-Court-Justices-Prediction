mr.
kirby,
here
what
happened
i...
as
i
understand
it,
was
that
a
search
warrant
was
served
on
the
tribe
itself,
and
so
i
think
that's
what
your
argument
should
probably
be
addressed
to.
i
think
in
hicks
we
held
that
there
could
be
process
served
against
individual
tribal
members.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
true
of
most
search
warrants.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
the
person
served
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
except
let
them
search.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if...
if
the...
what
is
the
federal...
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
of
the
tribe's
suit
against
the
petitioners
if
1983
is
not
available?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
theory
that
the
tribe
is
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
1983?
you
seem
to
assume
that
if
they
could
not
be
made
a
defendant,
they
also
could
not
be
a
plaintiff.
don't
you
make
that
assumption
in
your
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
that
assumption
plainly
wrong?
because
for...
to
be
a
defendant,
you
have
to
act
under
color
of
state
law.
so
there
are
all
sorts
of
persons
who
can
be
plaintiffs
who
could
never
be
defendants.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
the
normal
course
of
events,
it
wouldn't
be
acting
under
state
law.
it's
acting
under
its
own
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
the
normal
course
of
events,
the
fact
that
it
might
not
be
a
defendant
wouldn't
shed
any
light
at
all
on
the
question
of
whether
it
could
be
a
person
for
plaintiff
purposes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
a
citizen,
an
ordinary
citizen,
could
be
a
person
for
plaintiff's
purposes
but
not
necessarily
a
defendant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--on
the
corporate
point
that
was
brought
up
earlier?
who
pays
the
income
tax
on
the
earnings
of
the
casino?
the
corporation
or
the
tribe?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
are
no
taxes
on
the
earnings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
owned
by
a
corporation
rather
than
by
the
tribe
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
who
owns
the
real
estate
that
the
casino
is
located
on?
the
tribe
or
the
corporation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
the
slot--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--how
about
the
slot
machines?
who
owns
the
slot
machines?
the
tribe
or
the
corporation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
does
the...
does
the
corporation
own
anything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
kind
of
a
background
question?
because
i'm
really
not
sure
of
the
answer.
supposing
a
tort
was
committed
within
the
casino
by
one
non-indian
against
another
non-indian.
where
would
the
recovery
be
allowed
for
that
tort?
could
they
sue
in
an
indian
court
or
state
court,
and
what
law
would
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
there
was
a
tort
committed
by
a
casino
employee
against
a
patron.
would
the
state
have
jurisdiction
over
that
suit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
could
the...
could
the
litigant
in
that
suit
get
discovery
from
the
tribe
in
that
suit--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
very
records
that
were
involved
in
this
case...
some
reason
they
had
to
identify
the
particular
person
in
the
casino
who
was
responsible
for
the
tort
and
you
have
to
look
at
employment
records
to
find
out.
could
they
get
that
in
a
civil
suit
in
state
court,
do
you
think?
