mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
justice
o'connor,
the...
the
solicitor
general's
office
today,
as
before,
believes
that
in
the
majority
of
the
cases,
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
cases,
claims
asserting
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
will
be
better
resolved
on
collateral
review.
the
question
has
been
whether
the
costs
of
applying
a
procedural
default
rule
outweigh
those
benefits,
and
it
has
been
our
experience,
with
the
application
of
the
rule
in
the
second
and
seventh
circuits
over
the
past
several
years,
that
the
administrative
costs
that
initially
were
feared
haven't...
haven't
been
borne
out,
and
that
the
degree
of
uncertainty
that
initially
led
us
to...
to
reach
the
position
that
a
procedural
default
rule
should
not
be
applied
hasn't
been
borne
out
either.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
in
the
main,
we
think
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
it
should
not...
the
rule's
operation
should
not
result
in
unfairness
to
defendants,
and
should
not
overload
the
courts
with
ineffectiveness
claims
that
are
asserted
prematurely
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
justice
souter,
the
best
that
we
can
tell,
and
this
is
based
on
essentially
anecdotal
reports
of
u.s.
attorney's
offices,
it's
somewhere
on
the
order
of
20
to
40
percent,
roughly,
of
cases
in
which
new
counsel
represents
the
defendant
on
appeal,
but
that...
i'd...
i
hesitate
to
rely
too
much
on
that
figure,
because
it
is
based
on
the
anecdotal
reports--
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
--and
additionally,
it
varies
significantly
by
locality,
depending
on
the
particular
rules
that
are
in
place
for
replacement
of
counsel
on
appeal.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
this
issue?
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
we
don't...
we
don't
have
the
figures
on
that.
we
don't...
we
don't
track
the
figures
by
substantive
claims,
and
so
it's
been
difficult
to
come
up
with
numbers
that
reflect
the
treatment
of
ineffectiveness
claims
in
particular.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
it's...
it's
hard
to
say
because
there's
no
hard
scientific
data,
and
i--
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
--no,
we
haven't
been
conducting
an
examination
of
that.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
that...
justice
breyer,
it's
correct
that
it
saves
time
at
the
stage
of
collateral
review,
but
the
question
for
procedural
default
purposes
is
the
effect
of
the
rule
at
the
time
of
direct
appeal,
and--
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
--but
the
consequences
of
having
a
procedural
default
rule
is
that
it
encourages
the
raising
of
ineffectiveness
claims
on
direct
appeal
in
any
essential
issues.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
justice
breyer,
there
are
situations
in
which
ineffectiveness
claims
can
be
raised
and
resolved
on
direct
appeal,
and--
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
--it
is
a
narrow
category
of
cases,
justice
o'connor,
but
those
cases
do
exist.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
as
a...
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
the
1-year
statute
of
limitations
applies,
but
that's
also
true
of
other
substantive
claims,
and
yet
the
court
has
continued
to
apply
the
cause
in
prejudice
standard
to
encourage
the
raising
of
those
claims
at
the
earliest
available
opportunity,
and
that's
the...
that's
the
principal
policy
interest
behind
applying
the
procedural
default
rule
in
this
context.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
mr.
chief
justice,
the
question
before
the
court
is...
is
purely
a
federal
question.
the
states
have
adopted
varying
approaches,
as
we've
suggested
in
our
briefs.
a
significant
number
of
states
require
the
raising
of
ineffectiveness
claims
on
direct
appeal,
and
judge
the
raising
of
an
ineffectiveness
claim
on
collateral
review
by
a
cause
in
prejudice
standard.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
the
majority...
it
appears
that
the
majority
of
states
go
the
other
way,
but
it's
not
entirely
clear,
justice
stevens,
because
some
of
the
states
haven't
spoken
directly
on
the
question.
what
we...
what
we
know
is
that
19
states...
it
was
20
at
the
time
we
filed
our
brief,
but
it's
now
19,
follow
the
cause
in
prejudice
approach
and
require
the
raising
of
ineffectiveness
claims
on
direct
appeal,
and
there's
at
least
a
significant
number
of
states
that
don't
require
the
raising
of
ineffectiveness
claims
on
direct
appeal,
but
it's
unclear
whether
there's
more
than
20,
and
so
we
don't
know
exactly
whether
it's
a
majority
or
not,
but...
but
there
at
least
are
a
significant
number
that
apply
procedural
default
principles
to
the
raising
of
claims
on
direct
appeal,
and
that's--
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
--justice
ginsburg,
our
position
was
that
there
was
no
need
for
national
uniformity
in
the
sense
that
the
court
need
not
grant
review
to
impose
a
national...
national
uniform
rule.
we
didn't...
we
thought
that
there
was
no
unfairness
in
the
existing
divergence
of
approaches
among
the
courts
of
appeals,
because
in
each
court
of
appeals,
a
defendant
had
notice
of
the
particular
approach
that
applied
in
that
circuit,
and
so
a
defendant
knew
ahead
of
time
whether
he
had
to
raise
its
ineffectiveness
claim
on
direct
appeal,
or
whether
he
could
wait
without
penalty
and
raise
it
on
collateral
review.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
now
that
the
court
has
granted
certiorari,
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
adopt
a
nationwide
rule
similar
to
what
the
court
essentially
did
in
bousley,
where
the
question
was
the
proper
time
for
raising
an
objection
to
a
guilty
plea
on
grounds
that
the
plea
was
not
voluntary,
or...
or
intelligent,
and
the
court
reached
a
resolution
that
required
the
raising
of
those
claims
on
direct
appeal
and
adopted,
it...
it
appears,
a
nationwide
solution,
and
we
think
a
similar
approach
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case,
that
the
court
should
decide
whether
on
a
national
scale
ineffectiveness
claims
can
always
be
brought
on
collateral
review
without
any
concerns
about
procedural
default,
or,
as
we
think
is
appropriate,
that
ineffectiveness
claims
should
be
required
to
be
raised
on
direct
appeal
in
those
situations
in
which
counsel
is
new
and
the
record...
the
record
for
the
claim
is
fully
developed
in
the
trial
record.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
justice
ginsburg,
there...
there
are
decisions
that
address
that
issue
in
the
state
courts,
and
i
believe
at
least
a
couple
that
address
that
issue
in
the
federal
courts,
and
generally,
the
approach
has
been
that
defenders
from
the
same
public...
attorneys
from
the
same
public
defender's
office
are
considered
the
same
attorney
for
purposes
of
conflict,
determining
whether
there's
a
conflict
in
one
alleging
that
the
other
rendered
ineffective
assistance.
and
that,
i
think,
comes
from
the
aba
professional
rules,
and
i...
and
i
believe
it's
model
rule
1.1,
which
suggests
that
competence
is
imputed
to
attorneys
that
operate
within
the
same
firm,
and
that
confirms
that,
at
least
for
private
firm
purposes,
two
attorneys
from
the
same
firm
would
be
considered
to
be
the
same
attorney
for
procedural
default...
default
purposes,
and
we
think
the
same
approach
would
follow
with
respect
to
public
defender's
offices,
so
i
don't
think
that
the
question
of
the
same
attorney
is
going
to
give
rise
to
a
great
deal
of
litigation
or
uncertainty.
the
rules
in
that
area
ought
to
be
pretty
clear.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
that
question,
that
situation
is
going
to
arise
regardless
of
how
this
court
resolves
the
procedural
default
question,
because
in
all
the
courts
of
appeals
a
defendant
can
raise
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
typically,
yes,
that's
the
way
2255
works,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
no,
i
think
as
i
was...
as
i
was
attempting
to
suggest
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
i
think
that
would
be
considered
the
same
attorney,
and
that
follows
from
conflicts
principles.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
that
attorneys
within
the
same
office
are
considered
to
be
the
same
attorney
for
purposes
of
conflicts,
and
that
informs
the
proper
approach
in...
in
the
procedural
default
inquiry,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
all
the
courts
of
appeals
are
confronted
with
ineffective
assistance
claims
that
are
raised
on
direct
appeal.
no
court
of
appeals
prohibits
the
assertion
of
an
ineffectiveness
claim
on
direct
appeal,
so
in
every
court,
the
court
of
appeals
is
faced
with
one
of
three
options
at
the
time
an
ineffectiveness
claim
is
raised.
they
can
deny
the
claim
on
the
merits
if
they
can
conclude
that
in
no
circumstances
the
claim
could
succeed,
they
could
grant
relief
on
ineffectiveness
grounds
in
the
narrow
category
of
cases
in
which
entitlement
to
relief
will
be
apparent
from
the
trial
record,
or
they
could
decline
to
resolve
the
claim
and
remit
its
resolution
to
2255,
and
that's
precisely
the
same
three
options
that
confront
the
second
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit,
who
apply
the
procedural
default
rule.
so
justice
ginsburg,
in
response
to
your
question,
the
courts
of
appeals
are
faced
with
the
same
array
of
options
whether
this
court
adopts
a
procedural
default
principle
or
not,
and
in
the
ninth
circuit,
for
example,
in
2001,
the
court
faced
roughly
on
the
order
of
50
direct
appeals
in
which
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
was
asserted
as
a
basis
for
relief,
and
in
10
of
those
cases,
the
court
was
able
to
decide
conclusively
that
the
claim
was
lacking
in
merit
and
therefore
couldn't
be
brought
again
under
2255,
and--
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
--that...
that
possibility
certainly
is
there,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
think
the
same
possibility
arises
at
the
time
of
collateral
review,
when
the
attorney...
when
you'd
expect
the
attorney
equally
to
desire
the
cooperation
of
trial
counsel,
but
any
effort
to
assert
ineffectiveness
could
create
the
same
sort
of
tension
in
the
relationship.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
i...
i
don't
have
statistics
of
that
variety,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
it's
been
generally
recognized
by
several
courts
that
ineffective
assistance
claims
are
often
raised
on
collateral
review,
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
in
a
significant
portion
of...
of
2255
petitions,
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
will
be
at
least
one
ground
for
relief.
and
one
effect
of
applying
a
procedural
default
principle
would
be
to
encourage
the
raising
and
resolution
of
those
claims
on
direct
appeal
in
those
situations
in
which
it's
appropriate,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
there
are
at
least
some
cases
in
which
a
court
of
appeals
can
resolve,
on
the
basis
of
the
trial
record,
that
the...
that
trial
counsel
either
was
or
was
not
ineffective,
and
this
court,
for
example,
in
its...
in
its
kimmelman
decision,
the...
pointed
out
that
trial
counsel's
ineffectiveness,
at
least
in
terms
of
the
performance
prong
of
the
strickland
inquiry,
was
apparent
from
the
trial
record,
and
there
will
be
situations
like
that
that
arise
every
so
often,
and
perhaps
more
frequently
an
appellate
court
will
be
able
to
determine
that
trial
counsel's
performance
was
not
ineffective
and
will
be
able
to
make
that
determination
perhaps
because,
no
matter
how
deficient
the
performance
was,
the...
the
particular
matter
at
issue
could
never
have
resulted
in
prejudice
for
the
defendant.
for
example,
if
the
claim
of
ineffectiveness
is
that
trial
counsel
was
ineffective
in
failing
to
competently
impeach
a
particular
witness,
an
appellate
court
could
perhaps
look
at
the
trial
record
and
determine
that
the
testimony
of
that
particular
witness
was
not
central
to
the
prosecution's
case,
and
in
those
circumstances,
could
a
more
effective
impeachment
have
given
rise
to
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
result
at
trial
would
have
been
different.
so
there
are
going
to
be
some
situations
in
which
a
court
of
appeals
can
resolve
an
ineffectiveness
claim
at
the
time
of
direct
appeal,
and
in
those
situations,
it
seems
appropriate
to
encourage
the
raising
of
the
claim
at
that
stage
in
order
to
promote
respect
for
the
finality
of
criminal
judgments
and
also
to
promote
the
resolution
of
legal
claims
at
the
earliest
feasible
opportunity.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
we're
not
aware
that--
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
--well,
we're
not
aware
of
any...
of
any
effect
of
that
sort
in
either
the
second
or
seventh
circuits
which
apply
the
procedural
default
rule,
and...
and
i
think
if
trial
counsel's
involved
in
the
gamesmanship,
one
would
have
to
conceive
of
a
situation
in
which
trial
counsel
found
it
in
his
interest
to
ensure
that
appellate
counsel
could
confirm
his
ineffectiveness
at
trial,
and
that
situation
perhaps
is
unlikely
to
arise.
and
in
terms
of
the
distinction
between
appellate
counsel
calling
into
question
trial
counsel's
ineffectiveness,
and
trial
counsel
calling
into
question
his
own
ineffectiveness,
justice
kennedy,
this
court
in
kimmelman
observed
what
i
think
would...
is
a
common
sense
proposition,
which
is
that
trial
counsel
is
unlikely
to
bring
into
question
his
own
competence
at
trial
and,
in
fact,
he
would...
he
would
create
a
conflict
situation,
and
therefore
the
system
just
doesn't
operate
on
the
assumption
that
trial
counsel
should
be
required
to
identify
his
own
ineffectiveness
and
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
true
that...
that
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel
is...
would
constitute
cause
for
failing
to
raise
the
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel
at...
on
direct
appeal,
that
that
is
also
true
in...
with
all
other
substantive
claims,
that
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel
for
failing
to
raise
any
substantive
claim
at
the
time
of
direct
appeal
could
constitute
cause
excusing
the
default,
yet
this
court
has
continued
to
apply
procedural
default
principles
in
the
case
of
other
substantive
claims,
and
so
i'm
not
sure
that
that
particular
consideration
tips
the
balance
decidedly
in
one
direction
or
the
other.
and
in
fact,
the
court
has
made
clear
in
decisions
such
as
murray
versus
carrier
and
smith
versus
murray,
and...
and
recently
in
smith
versus
robbins,
that
it's
difficult
to
make
out
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel
because
appellate
counsel's
decision
whether
to
raise
a
particular
claim
is
the
hallmark
of
effective
advocacy,
and
one
would
have
to
show
that
appellate
counsel
was
unreasonable
in
failing
to
present
one
claim
instead
of
another
at
the
time
of
appellate
briefing
in
order
to
establish
that
there
was
cause
for
failing
to
raise
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel
at
the
time
of
direct
appeal.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
justice
souter,
the
government
won't
get
that
chance
if
it's
resolved
on
direct
appeal.
if
it's
raised
on
direct
appeal,
the
government,
of
course,
shares
an
interest
in
assuring
that
the
trial
court...
that
the
appellate
court,
excuse
me,
does
not
resolve
the
claim
because
it
would
say--
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
--well,
in
order
to
ameliorate
that
possibility,
justice
souter,
the
seventh
circuit,
for
example,
has
adopted
a
standard
under
which
it
will
not
decide
a
claim
of
ineffectiveness
in
the
defendant's
favor
unless
there's
no
possible
strategic
rationale
for
counsel's
decision
and,
of
course,
to
the
extent
that
there
may
be
a
strategic
rationale
for
the
counsel's
decision,
it'll
be
in
the
government's
interest
to
bring
that
to
the
court's
attention
in
its
appellate
briefing,
and
we
haven't
seen
too
many
situations
in
which
a
court
grants
a
claim
of
ineffectiveness
on
direct
appeal,
but
yet
there
was
potentially
a
strategic
rationale
for
counsel's
decision.
in
fact,
the
court
should
grant
relief
on
ineffectiveness
grounds
on
direct
appeal
only
in
situations
such
as
the
one
that
confronted
the
court
in
kimmelman,
where
there
was
an
extended
dialogue
between
trial
counsel
and
the
trial
court
concerning
trial
counsel's
assertively
deficient
decision--
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
--and
trial
counsel
was
able
to
explain
to
the
trial
court
the
basis
of
its
decision,
and
from
trial
counsel's
explanation,
one
could
determine
that
it
wasn't
based
on
a
strategic
rationale,
but
instead
was
based
simply
on
a
misunderstanding
of
the
time,
of
the
timeliness
of
the
rejection
rule
that
was
at
issue.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
that...
that
could
arise,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's...
that's
one
potential
evidentiary
way
to
show
that
trial
counsel
was
ineffective.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
i'm
not...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
privileges
weigh
into
it.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
that's
correct.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
that's...
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
it's
in
the
government...
the
government
does
do
that,
and
it's
in
their
interest
to
do
that
to
ensure
that
the
result
of
trial
is
upheld.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
i
think
that's
right,
justice
kennedy.
if
i
could
turn
just
for
one
moment
to
the
application
of
a
procedural
default
rule
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
in...
if
the
procedural
default
rule
were
to
be
applied,
the
question
at
the
time
of
collateral
review
is
whether...
is
whether
the
defendant
has
introduced
extrinsic
evidence
not
available
in
the
trial
record
in
support
of
this
claim
of
ineffectiveness,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
found
that
there
was
no
extrinsic
evidence
material
to
the
claim
of
ineffectiveness
introduced
in
the
affidavits
on
which
the
petitioner
relies
because
the
affidavits
suggests
avenues
of
inquiry
the
trial
counsel
could
have
pursued
that
trial
counsel
in
fact
did
pursue.
for
example,
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
that
there
was
no
blood
spatter
remaining
from
the
wound,
and
that...
that
no
blood
spatter
reflected
on
the
upholstery
of
the
car,
or
no
blood
itself
on
the
front
passenger
seat,
or
that
the
body
of
the...
the
position
of
the
body
wasn't
consistent
with
the
testimony
concerning
the
firing
of
the
second
shot,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
in
all
of
those
avenues
were,
in
fact,
explored
by
the
trial
record...
excuse
me,
by
trial
counsel,
and
were
presented
to
the
jury,
and
the
jury
evidently
found
them
not
persuasive.
mr.
srikanth
srinivasan
she
did.
she
offered
a
continuance
on
a
few
occasions
to
trial
counsel,
and
trial
counsel
turned
it
down,
but
i
think
the
defendant's
burden
at
the
time
of
collateral
review
now
is
to
show
that
the
refusal
of
a
continuance
worked
to
the
defendant's
detriment
and
resulted
in
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
result
at
trial
would
have
been
different
had
he...
had
he
accepted
a
continuance,
and
the
affidavits
only
present
avenues
of
inquiry
that
trial
counsel
in
fact
pursued,
which
indicates,
and
i
think
in
some
sense
confirms,
that
a
continuance
would
not
have
affected
the
results
at
trial.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice--
