chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
01-1559,
joseph
massaro
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
fahringer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
you
could
go...
you
could
have
an
entire
separate
proceeding,
mr.
fahringer,
and
just
have
exhaustive
discovery
and
so
on,
but
there...
there
comes
a
time
when
there
is
an
interest
in
finality,
that
you
don't
want
the
thing
just
postponed
to
another
day,
which
this
does.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
wish
to
reserve
your
remaining
time,
mr.
fahringer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
just
a
federal
question,
mr.
srinivasan,
or
are...
does
it
carry
over
to
cases
going
through
state
courts,
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
is
the
procedure
in
the...
in
the
federal
system
for
a
collateral...
collateral
action,
they
have
a
claim
that's
ineffective.
does
that
go
back
to
the
judge
who
was
the
trial
judge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
mr.
fahringer's
point
that
if
you
follow
your
rule,
you're
going
to
get
a
second
generation
of
ineffective
assistance
claims,
that
is,
that
the
counsel
who
didn't
raise
or
did
raise
something
on
appeal
was
ineffective?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
a
collateral
proceeding,
mr.
srinivasan,
you're
developing
evidence,
you
have
the
trial...
you
put
the
trial
counsel
on
the
stand
and
the
new
counsel
cross
examines
him
to
see...
prove
how
badly
he
did?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
there
any
limit
on
the...
can
you,
you
know,
examine
the
trial
counsel
for
his
mental
processes
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
srinivasan.
mr.
fahringer,
you
have
14
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
we're
not
trying
to
decide
here
whether--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--or
not
this
claim
should
be
sustained
or
rejected.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fahringer.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.

united
states
