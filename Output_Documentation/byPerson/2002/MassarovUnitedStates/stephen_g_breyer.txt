justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
a
little
confused
on
the
same
point.
i
thought
that,
suppose...
does...
would
you
say
that
a
defendant
is
forbidden
to
raise
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
on
direct
appeal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
you're
just
saying
that
if
he
doesn't,
you
can...
he
can
raise
it
later
in
2255.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
appellate
court
can't
say
to
him,
oh,
you
should
have
raised
it
earlier,
so
you're
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
so
all
we're
doing
is
defining
the...
the
scope
of
the
procedural
bar
rule
when
a
person
goes
into
2255.
we're
not
controlling
what
he
says
on
his
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
he
doesn't
make
it
on
direct
appeal,
you
want
him
to
be
able
to
make
it
on
2255
and
not
be
met
with
the
argument,
oh,
you
should
have
brought
it
on
direct
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
could
there
be?
i
mean,
what
the
problem
is,
is
in
a
very
small
number
of
cases,
hardly
any,
you
have
a
case
in
the
district
court
where
the
judge
is
serving
as
a
habeas
judge,
and
the
government
in
a
very
small
number
of
cases
comes
in
and
makes
the
argument,
judge,
he
cannot
raise
this
ineffective
assistance
claim
because
he
should
have
raised
it
on
direct
appeal,
although
he
didn't,
and
then
the
cost
to
the
system
is
hidden
in
the
mind
of
the
judge,
in
the
minds
of
the
lawyers
who
have
to
spend
time
briefing
that
and
going
and
finding
some
affidavits,
and
trying
to
get
around
it.
i
mean,
how
could
you
get
empirical
information,
and
what
led
you
to
change
your
opinion?
have
you
been
investigating
the
minds
of
the
judge
or
the
minds
of
the
lawyers
in
some
way,
that
you
know
that
they
aren't
actually
aggravated,
that
you
know
that
they
aren't
actually
disturbed
at
having
to
waste
their
time
on
such
an
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i'm
sure
you
haven't.
i'm
being
a
little
facetious,
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
empirical
data.
the
world
won't
come
to
an
end
if
you
lose
this
case.
all
it
will
do
is
save
judges
and
lawyers
a
certain
amount
of
time,
which,
if
you
win
this
case,
they
will
have
spent
for
no
reason.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
save
no
time
on
direct
appeal,
it's
nothing.
i
mean,
what
we're
talking
about
is
cases
where
the
person
didn't
raise
the
argument
on
direct
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
everybody
will
have
to
go
and
make
the
same
argument
twice.
first
they'll
have
to
go
and
make
the
argument
on
direct
appeal,
a
lot
of
them,
and
then
they
will
have
to
remake
the
argument
on
collateral
review,
this
time
trying
to
explain
why
it's
somehow
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are.
