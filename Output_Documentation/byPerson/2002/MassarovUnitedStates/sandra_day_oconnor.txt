well,
let...
would...
would
it
ever...
would
the
basis
for
an
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
claim
ever
be
apparent
on
the
trial
court
record
without
resort
to
extrinsic
evidence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
never?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fahringer,
is...
does
aedpa
require
that
all
such
claims
have
to
be
brought
within
1
year
in
any
event?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
srinivasan,
suppose
you
start
by
telling
us
why
the
sg
changed
the
position
that
it
had...
that
he
had
taken
for
so
long
on
this
point?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
in
effect
you
think
that
what's
happening
now
in
ca-2
and
ca-7
is
just
fine?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there...
a
fairly
small
number,
i
would
assume?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
any
event,
the
aedpa
time
limits
apply,
do
they
not,
even
if
we
followed
a
different
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
srinivasan,
do
you
have
any
idea
of
what
percentage
of
cases,
of
criminal
convictions
result
in
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
claims?
is
it
90
percent
of
them,
50
percent
of
them,
what?
do
we
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet
the...
the
trial
judge
herself
said
to
defense
counsel,
aren't
you
going
to
move
for
a
continuance,
when
this
bullet
came...
was
unearthed
after
all
that
time.
didn't
she,
a
couple
of
times,
hint
that
it
would
be...
might
be
a
good
idea
for
defense
counsel
to
seek
a
continuance?
