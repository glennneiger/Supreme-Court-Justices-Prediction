is
your
position
that
it's
2255
only,
or
that
it
is
the
new
counsel's
option
whether
he
thinks
it's
appropriate
to
raise
the
ineffective
assistance
claim
on
direct
appeal,
or
whether
he
thinks
it's
best
to
wait
until
the
2255
stage?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
are
you
saying
he
can't
bring
it
earlier,
even
if
he
thinks
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
most
cases,
even
in
the
second
circuit,
do
go
into
the
2255
mold,
because
in
most
cases
it
will
not
be
clear
on
the
record,
and
the
second
circuit
rule
that
you
must
bring
it
on
direct
review
applies
only
when
it
is
clear,
the
ineffectiveness
is
clear
on
the
record,
if
you
need
to
look
outside
the
record,
then
the
second
circuit
agrees
it
doesn't
belong
on
direct
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there...
but
are
there
not
cases
where
the
second
circuit
has
recognized
this
particular
claim
depends
on
extra-record
material?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
right
that
the
government's
position
before
the...
before
we
granted
cert
in
this
case
was,
this
lack
of
uniformity
is
all
right,
that
either
rule
will
do,
and
that
lawyers,
defense
lawyers
in
the
second
circuit
will
file
the
second
circuit's
rule,
and
defense
lawyers
in
the
fifth
circuit
will
file
the
fifth
circuit
rule,
and
that
was
okay?
wasn't
that
the
government's
original
position...
you
were
never
saying,
it
must
be
direct
review
if
it's
clear
on
the
record?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
effectively,
you
told
us
not
to
bother
with
this
case,
but
once
we
granted
cert,
then
the
government
had
to
take
a
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
can
imagine,
if
the
requirement
that
the
counsel
be
new
in
order
to
force
you
to
raise
it
on
direct
appeal,
that
in
itself
could
be
the
subject
of
controversy.
that
is,
if
you
take
a
public
defender
office,
and
one
public
defender,
one
member
of
that
office
conducts
the
trial,
and
then
another
member
of
that
office
conducts
the
appeal,
is
that
new
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there's
one
aspect
of
the
government's
decision,
now
that
it
has
to
take
a
position
one
way
or
another.
these
questions,
ineffectiveness
of
counsel,
deal
with
what
went
on
in
the
trial
court,
and
ordinarily,
the
first
view
of
such
questions
is
taken
by
a
court
of
first
instance,
not
an
appellate
court,
and
yet
here,
the
first
look
under
the
rules
you
are
now
supporting
would
be
taken
by
an
appellate
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
the
court
of
appeals
can
always
say,
we
think
it
would
be
better
to
have
this
aired
in
the...
in
the
court
of
first
instance,
so
there
will
be
no
prejudice
to
our
rejecting
it
now,
you
can
bring
it
in
2255,
but
the
one
that...
the
concern
here
is
the
defendant
and
his
new
counsel,
whether
the
new
counsel
can
safely
say,
if
i
have
any
doubt,
i'm
going
to
hold
it
back
to
the
2255,
and
one
point
that
was
made
was
that
on
direct
appeal,
it's
important
for
the
appellate
counsel
to
have
the
cooperation
of
the
trial
lawyer
to
help
him
go
through
the
record
and
point
out
possible
grounds
for
appeal.
but
if
the
new
counsel
is
going
to
insert
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
at
that
stage,
it
will
make
the
relationship
between
trial
and
appellate
counsel
rather
tense,
will
it
not?
