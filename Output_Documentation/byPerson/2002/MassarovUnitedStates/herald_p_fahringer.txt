mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
urge
that
the
appropriate
rule
for
the
resolution
of
ineffective
assistance
claims
of
counsel
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
is
best
handled
in
a
collateral
proceeding
in
the
first
instance,
without
first
resorting
to
direct
appeal
and,
if
that
claim
might
qualify
for
direct
appeal,
it
should
not
be
a
procedural
bar.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
well,
certainly,
your
honor,
that
is
implicated,
your
supervisory
powers.
i
also
think
that
under
the
fifth
amendment,
which
has
often
been
construed
to
contain
the
equivalent
of
equal
protection
of
the
law,
that
this
is
a
circumstance,
with
the
division
in
the
circuit,
that
calls
out
for
uniformity.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
in
this
circumstance,
your
honor,
and
i'm
not
urging
the
fourteenth
amendment.
what
i'm
urging
is,
you
have
in
the
past
had
this
circumstance
with,
for
instance,
the
wade
hearings,
where
it
was
deemed
necessary
that
you
unify
the
system
in
the
country
so
that
there
is
the
equal
protection,
particularly
in
an
area
as
important
as
criminal
prosecution.
certainly,
we
would
all
agree
that
the...
the
most
important
right
a
defendant
possesses
in
a
criminal
proceeding
is
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--well,
your
honor,
if...
if
i've
overstated,
that
i
apologize,
but
certainly
under
your
supervisory
powers,
i
think
that
this
case
calls
for
unity.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
well,
i...
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor.
i...
i
would
urge
that
it
is...
it
lends
some
force
to
our
argument
up
here
that
certainly
a
majority
of
the
circuits
and
the
highest
courts
of
36
states
have
embraced
the
collateral
review,
and...
and
the
reason--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--it...
there
may
be
one,
one
rare
case,
but...
as
judge
easterbrook
in
the
seventh
circuit
said
so
eloquently,
and
that
is
that
in
the...
because
of
the
unique
nature
of
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
because
of
the
relationship
between
the
attorneys,
and
the...
and
so
much
is
a
matter
of
omission
and
the
confidential
relationship
that
he
stated
in
every
case
there
is
something
that
you
could
do
to
add
to
the
record
that
might
reinforce
the
claim.
the
second
circuit,
most
respectfully,
your
honor,
has
said
that
only
in
a
very
few
cases
would
it
be
completely
clear
on
the
record.
the
other
reason
that
i
think
this
rule
is
superior
to
the
procedural
default
rule
is
that
it
would
bring
certitude
to
this
area,
where
people
would
know
with
some
degree
of
confidence
that
it
should
be
brought
in
a
collateral
proceeding.
it
has
the
element
of
efficiency,
in
that
it
brings
together
in
the
2255
proceeding
all
of
the
ineffectiveness
claims,
so
they
can
be
resolved
in
an
adversary
hearing,
which
is
certainly
the
best
method
of
raising
these
claims,
particularly
when
you
need
a
full
record.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
yes.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
should
be
an
option.
i
don't
think
we
can
ever
stop
a
defendant
from
raising
it
on
direct
appeal
if
he
makes
that
choice.
he...
he
assumes
the
risk,
then,
most
respectfully,
that
he...
it...
it
will
be
resolved,
whether
he
could
have
expanded
the
record
or
not,
but
my...
my
suggestion
to
the
court
is,
and
i
think
logic
supports
me
in
this
respect,
that
with
the
2255
collateral
available
to
him
proceeding,
that
certainly
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
would
be
brought
in
that
forum.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
but
those
fears,
your
honor,
that
were
expressed
in
frady,
for
example,
have
not
been
pretty
much
put
to
rest
by
aedpa,
because
now
you
have
a
statute
of
limitation,
so
that
these
are
not
going
to
go
on
and
on.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--and...
and
that
one
proceeding,
your
honor,
i...
i
understand
with
the
exception
of
an
individual
choice
that
one
proceeding
really
should
be
the
2255.
what
i
might
say,
as
an
example
to
this
court,
think
of
the
dilemma
a
defense
lawyer
faces
in
the
second
circuit
where
one,
if
he
sees
evidence
of
ineffectiveness
but
it's
not
fully
developed,
and
he
doesn't
raise
it
because
he
doesn't
think
he's
obliged
to,
there's
a
risk
of
procedural
default.
if
he
does
raise
it
and
it's
not
been
fully
developed,
it
may
be
resolved
by
the
court
on
a
partial
record,
whereas
if
he'd
been
in
a
2255
proceeding,
he
could
have
expanded
and
amplified
the
record,
which
would
have
strengthened
the
claim.
the
third
option
is,
that
the
second
circuit
seems
to
direct
is,
raise
it
at
the
earliest
possible
moment,
identify
it,
and
then
perhaps
we
will
send
it
back
for
remand.
well,
that,
that
seems
to
just
complicate
the
matter.
and
then
finally,
your
honor,
i
think
one
of
the
most
compelling
arguments,
which
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with,
that
this
would
put
an
end
to
needless
expenditure
of
judicial
resources
on
resolving
the...
the
cause
and
prejudice
rule.
remember,
in
a
circuit
like
the
second
circuit,
every
single
man,
woman
that
goes
into
a
2255
proceeding
because
they
have
this
direct
appeal
rule
as
an
exception
must
establish
cause
and
prejudice
at
the
threshold.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
that's
right,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
speaking
in
the
terms
of
that.
obviously,
if
you
had
the
same
lawyer,
that
would...
your
honor,
that
would
really
be
cause,
so
it
may
be
that
he
would
be
able
to
easily
overcome
the
cause
aspect,
but
he
still
has
the
prejudice
aspect
that
he
has
to
establish.
in
the
other
circuits,
he
can
go
right
in
on
a
2255,
and...
and
2255
itself
says
that
unless
it's
conclusively
established
that
his...
his
papers
are
without
merit,
a
hearing
shall
be
granted,
so
there's
a
terrible
disparity
in
the
way
defendants
are
treated
who
are
trying
to...
to
restore
this
most
important
right.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
i
think
yes.
i--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--and
your
honor,
i
hope
i'm
answering
your
question,
because
i
want
to
be
direct.
you
avoid
that
by
the
2255
collateral
review
rule.
right
now,
the
second
circuit
is
involved
in
a
large
number
of
cases
where
they
come
up
and
they
just
say,
well,
this
really
should
go
back,
and...
and
that...
that
prolongs
the
appellate
process.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
no.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
that's
right.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
precisely,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--it
seems
to
me
that
if...
but
please
understand,
i
think
i
have
to
say
in
all
fairness,
if
he
takes
and
goes
up
on
the
direct
appeal
with
his
ineffectiveness
claim
and
the
appellate
court
resolves
it,
then
he
may
be
barred.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
yes.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
precisely.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
your
honor,
in
response
to
that,
there
really
is--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--unanimity
among
all
of
the
circuits
that
the
best
forum...
the
best...
the
second
circuit
agrees
with
this,
too.
the
best
forum
for
resolving
ineffectiveness
claims
is
in
the
collateral
proceeding,
when
you
have
access
to
discovery.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
no,
your
honor.
he
would
be
able
to
do
that.
the...
the...
but
if
i
may,
your
honor,
that's
triggered
another
grave
concern
here.
in...
under
strickland
you
indicated
that,
you
know,
ineffectiveness
claims
really
should
be
judged
in
aggregate
because
one
lends
force
to
another.
it
ought
to
be
the
overall
performance
of
the
attorney.
what
you
have
in
the
second
circuit
now
is
the
very
piecemeal
type
of
resolution
of
ineffectiveness
claims
that
you
just
described.
what
has
actually
happened,
and
we
cite
the
cases
in
our
brief,
they
take
one
because
that's,
they
say
is
fully
developed
on
the
record.
they
resolve
it.
two
more
go
back
down
to
the
2255
proceeding,
and
that
seems
to
be
in
direct
defiance
of
the
spirit,
at
least,
of
the
strickland
rule
that
they
should
all
be
decided
together
in
one
proceeding,
and
so
that,
you
know,
it's...
the...
the
powerful
arguments
of
efficiency,
simplicity,
and
fairness
to
all
parties
seems
to...
to
argue
for
the...
the
collateral
review
rule.
the
only
argument
they
lean
against
this
is
this
notion
of...
of
finality,
but...
but
i
submit
to
the
court
most
respectfully
that
that's
an...
that's
in
a...
an
almost
nonexistent,
narrow
margin
of
cases,
because
there's
always
more
you're
going
to
develop
on
the
record.
the
lawyer's
explanation,
for
instance,
you
know,
you
never
have
that--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--but
your
honor...
and...
and
i
welcome
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
is
this,
that
if,
as
the
second
circuit
itself
says,
it
is
only
in
a
very
few
cases
where
it
would
be
fully
developed
on
the
record,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
small
price
to
pay
for
a
much
simpler,
more
straightforward
rule
that
everybody
knows
where
they
stand.
lawyers
are
not
struggling
with
this
decision
in
the
second
circuit,
should
i
raise
it,
should
i
not
raise
it,
am
i
at
risk,
and
now
what
you've
done
is,
under
the
second
circuit's
rule
is,
you
have
spawned
a
whole
generation
of...
of
second
ineffectiveness
claims,
because
if
the
lawyer
doesn't
raise
it
and
the
defendant
understandably
says,
well,
you
should
have
raised
it
because
they
say
it
was
fully
developed
on
the
record
and
you
thought
it
wasn't,
now
you
have
another
whole
level
that
is
added
to
this,
so
the
complexity
is
staggering
that
is
developed.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
it
does
in
this
respect,
your
honor,
yes,
because
as
a
practical
matter
now,
under
aedpa
as
it
had
amended
2255,
if
you
bring
an
ineffectiveness
claim
in
a
2255
proceeding,
and
they
are
resolved,
and
you
want
to
try
to
bring
another
one,
you
have
to
get
permission
of
the
circuit
court,
of
course,
so
you've
got
some
control
over
it,
and...
and
then
all
claims
have
to
be
brought
within
a
year
in
any
event,
so
the
fears
that
were
expressed
in
frady
have
been
put
to
rest,
i
believe,
and
there's
really
no
good
reason.
i...
i
think
the
reason
the
solicitor
general
endorsed
this
rule
for
over
20
years,
and
they've
changed
their
mind
now,
but
certainly
we've
cited
case
after
case
where
they
argued
to
this
court
that...
that
this
is
the
best
way
to
do
it,
to
bring
it
in
a
collateral
proceeding,
because
that
is
the
fairest,
the
simplest.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
your
honor,
in
all
due
respect,
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
since
billy-eko
came
down,
35
cases
that
we
were
able
to
find
in
addition
to
this
one
were
defaulted,
because
the
second
circuit
said
it
should
have
been
brought,
there
was
enough
on
the
record.
so
this
is
a
terribly
ambiguous
and
controversial...
and
we
don't
know
how
many
cases
where
district
courts
just
simply
issued
an
order.
these
are
written
opinions,
many
of
them,
your
honor,
unpublished,
but
it--
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
--absolutely,
your
honor.
absolutely.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
i
think
lends
force
to
our
argument
here
is
that
even
the
second
circuit
acknowledged
it,
and
yet
they
persist
in
holding
to
that
narrow
exception
that
it
should
be
raised
on
direct
appeal,
and
that
narrow
exception
means
that
in
every
2255
proceeding,
a
defendant
must
overcome
what
is
a
fairly...
a
large
hurdle
of...
of
cause
and
prejudice,
and
that's
not
true
in
the
other...
in
the
other
circuits,
so
we
believe,
on
balance,
the
better
rule,
and
the
one
that
will
more
effectively
administer
justice,
should
be
this
one.
with
that
being
said,
i'd
like
to
close
by
just
simply
urging
the
court
that
since
one
of
the
most
cherished
policies
of
this
nation
is
that,
and
of
the
criminal
justice
system
is
that
a
person
is
entitled
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
but
if
that
right
is
rendered
meaningless
because
if
he's
denied
that
safeguard,
he
has
no
effective
remedy
to
cure
it,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
right
has
been
sadly
lost,
and
i
would
ask
this
court
to
adopt
the
rule
that
we
urge.
thank
you
so
much.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
i'm
going
to
have
to
use
them,
but
let
me
go
right
to
this
matter
of
prejudice.
the
court
should
understand
that
the
district
court,
nor
the
court
of
appeals,
decided
the
prejudice
issue.
this
was
decided
purely
on
procedural
ground
that
there
was
a
sufficient
record
to
raise
it
on
appeal,
and
what
i
think
it's
important
for
you
to
understand
is
that
although
in
the
trial
record
you
had
the
justice
pleading
with
defense
counsel
to
take
a
continuance,
investigate
this
bullet
that
became
the
most
important
piece
of
evidence
in
the
case...
the
prosecutor
stated
that
in
the
second
circuit,
this
was
our
most
important
piece
of
evidence.
that
became
the
pivotal
point
of
the
trial,
and...
and
the
affidavits
don't
simply
talk
about
avenues
the
defense
lawyer
should
have
taken,
what
the
affidavits
say
is
that
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
this
bullet
was
fired
in
that
car,
and
they
say
that
it
is
not
consistent
with
the
chief
and
one
and
only
witness
that
was
involved
in
the
homicide,
so
what
was
missing,
the
indispensable
component
for
an
ineffectiveness
claim
was
the
prejudice.
that
was
not
on
the
record.
what
you
had
is,
you're
not
taking
an
adjournment,
but
all
you
have
in
the
record
is,
the
bullet
and
the
prosecution's
proof.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
no.
mr.
herald
p.
fahringer
no,
i...
you're...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
agree.
what
i
would
like
to
say
is,
i
think
the
solicitor
general
is
mistaken
when
he
responded
to
your
question
and
said
that
there
would
still
be
ineffectiveness
claims
against
appellate
counsel.
if
this
court
adopts
the
rule
that
a
ineffectiveness
claim
can
be
brought
under
2255
and
does
not
have
to
be
first
explored
in
those
few
cases
on
direct
appeal,
then
there
certainly
can
be
no
claim
made
against
appellate
counsel
for
not
raising
that
claim.
the
other
issue
that's
been
identified
here,
which
is
one
of
some
moment,
is
new
counsel.
the...
the
second
circuit
has
held
in
a
case,
it's
unreported
so
i
won't
discuss
it,
but
you
should
know
that
there's
a
holding
that
the
legal
aid
society,
when
it
went
over
to
the
appeals
bureau,
that
was
a
different
lawyer,
even
though
it
was
the
same
society,
so
it...
it
is...
there's
ambiguity
there,
too.
what
if
the
trial
lawyer
goes
out
and
gets
what
he
thinks
is
a
good
appellate
lawyer
to
come
in
of
counsel
with
him,
and
the
new
appellate
lawyer
comes
in
and
he
sees
the
colleague
who
brought
him
into
the
case
has
got...
i
mean,
it
just
is
generating
one
complexity
after
another.
if
you
look
at
the
seventh
circuit
rule,
they
have
put
so
many
exceptions
onto
this,
as
has
been
identified,
that...
that
it's
just
becoming
i
think
unmanageable
and
the
rule
is
becoming
unadministratable,
and
for
that
reason
it
cries
out
for
a
new
rule.
thank
you,
your
honor.
