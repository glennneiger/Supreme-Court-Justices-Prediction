under
your
rule,
as
i
understand
it,
new
appellate
counsel
has
the
obligation
to
search
through
the
record
to
show,
to
find
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
the
trial
counsel
doesn't
have
that
obligation.
that,
number
one,
seems
to
me
a
little
bit
arbitrary
and,
secondly,
i'm
wondering
if
that
might
not
itself
have
an
effect
on
how
often
petitioner
gets
new
appellate
counsel
as
opposed
to
having
his
trial
counsel.
do
you
think
there
might
be
some
effect
of
this
rule
on
the
decision
to
retain
new
counsel
at
the
appellate
stage?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
maybe
even
some
gamesmanship
playing,
where
that
trial
counsel
is
counsel
of
record,
but
he
really
gets
new
appellate
counsel
to
help
him
out?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
no
privilege
problems,
are
there...
or
maybe
i'm
wrong...
if...
if
the
client
himself
has
the
new
attorney
examine
the
old
one.
he
waives
the
privilege.
justice
anthony
m.

the
united
states
court
of
appeals
are
divided
on
the
rules
pertaining
to
those
convicted
of
federal
crimes
who
wish
to
raise
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
some
courts
insisted
it
would
be
done
only
on
collateral
review,
others
the
second
and
seventh
circuits
hold
that
in
some
instances
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
is
procedurally
defaulted
if
it
is
not
brought
on
direct
appeal.
those
circuits
hold
that
the
claim
must
be
brought
on
the
direct
appeal
if
the
basis
for
it
appears
in
the
trial
record
and
the
appellate
counsel
is
new
counsel
i.e.
not
the
trial
counsel.
we
think
the
better
rule
is
to
allow
the
claim
to
be
brought
on
collateral
review
in
all
instances.
our
opinion
set
forth
various
reasons
which
can
best
be
summarized
as
explaining
that
our
rule
permits
the
most
efficient
allocation
of
judicial
resources.
so,
we
adopt
the
rule
of
the
majority
of
circuits
and
we
reverse
the
judgment
in
this
case
which
comes
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
we
do
note
that
counsels
are
not
precluded
from
raising
ineffective
assistance
claims
on
direct
review
and
that
an
appellate
court
may
note
ineffectiveness
sua
sponte
but
they
are
not
required
to
do
so.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
