justice

h.

how
many
cases
are
we
talking
about?
i
mean,
it's
the...
we're
arguing
about
a
sub-class
of
cases
in
which
counsel
changes
between
the
trial
and
the
direct
appeal.
either
in
percentage
terms
or
absolute
terms,
how
many
are
we
talking
about?
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
the
government
loses
one
thing
on...
on
your
theory
in...
in
certainly
some
of
the
ineffective
assistance
records
i've
had
here,
or
seen
here
where
the...
the
issue
arises
whether,
in
fact,
an
apparently
foolish
move
on
the
part
of
trial
counsel
was
dictated
by
what
ultimately
was
a
very
sensible
tactical
reason
which
is
not
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
record.
in
cases
like
that,
the
government
isn't
going
to
get
a
chance,
in
effect,
to
make
that
kind
of
rebuttal
if
the
issue
is
raised
on...
on
direct.
the
government
simply
won't
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
run
the...
there's
no
question
the...
but
the...
the
trial
court
may
not
give
you
the
chance.
i
mean,
you
run
a
risk
that
you're
going
to
get
cut
short
on
your
opportunity
to
get
trial
counsel
to
explain
what
may
look
like
a
very
dumb
thing
on
the...
on
the
record.
the
risk
you
run
is
that
the
trial...
that
the...
that
the
appellate
court
on
direct
appeal
is
going
to
say,
this
was
crazy,
no...
you
know,
there...
there
couldn't
be
any
sensible
explanation
for
this,
and
i...
i
don't
understand...
i
don't
know,
just
as
we
were
saying
before,
there's
no
way
to
tell
how...
how
frequently
a
situation
like
this
will
arise,
because
we
don't
have
any
hard
statistics
on
any
of
it,
but
i...
i
don't
know
why
you're
giving
that
up.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
government
frequently
in
these
cases
elicits
testimony
in
response
from
the
trial
counsel
saying,
well,
yeah,
i...
i
didn't
ask
the
question
because
i
didn't
want
to
get
into
this
sort
of
subject,
so
i
mean
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
take
it,
is
a
relatively
common
feature
in
these
cases.
