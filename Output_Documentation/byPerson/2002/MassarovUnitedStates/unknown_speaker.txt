what
is
the
source
of...
of
law
for
our
decision?
is
it
our
supervisory
powers,
whatever
we
think
best,
or--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you...
you're
saying
that
if
there's
a
circuit
different,
there's
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know,
that's
why
we
grant
certiorari
in
cases,
because
we
don't
think
one...
one
rule
should
be...
obtained
in
new
york
and
another
rule
in
new
orleans,
but
i
don't
think
we
ever
thought
it
was
the
equal
protection
clause
that--
unknown
speaker
--we
could
unify
it
the
way
that
you
don't
want.
unknown
speaker
--but
there's
something
to
be
said
for
winding
the
thing
up
and
getting
it
over
with,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
if
you...
if
you
have
a
choice
between
two
proceedings
and
one
proceeding,
certainly
there's
something
to
be
said
for
one
proceeding,
although
your
argument
is
that
one
proceeding
simply
isn't
as
effective
as
two,
but
i
think
you
have
to
recognize
that
all
things
being
equal,
it
would
be
better
having
one
proceeding
than
two.
unknown
speaker
well,
not...
not
everyone.
i...
i
mean,
only
one
who...
who
got
new
counsel
on
the
direct
appeal.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
have
a
case
where...
and
you
stated
earlier
that
this
doesn't
happen
very
often,
but
suppose
it's
evident
on
the
face
of
the
record
that
the
counsel
was
ineffective.
he
stands
up
and
says
on
the
record,
your
honor,
i
wish
the
record
to
show
i've
been
asleep
for
an
hour
during
the
key
cross
examination.
isn't
it
there
also
an
efficiency
in
just
sending
it
back
for
new
trial
right
away,
rather
than
going
through
all
of
the
other
claimed
errors?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
it's
evident
that
the
case
has
to
go
back,
why
have
the
district
court...
or,
pardon
me,
the
appellate
courts
examine
the
entire
record
and...
and
give
a
lengthy
opinion
that's
obviously
going
to
be
unnecessary?
unknown
speaker
we're
not.
unknown
speaker
yes,
so...
so
in
other
words,
if
he
chooses
to
go
and
appeal,
direct
appeal--
unknown
speaker
--he's
not
going
to
be
able
to
make
exactly
the
same
claim
later
in
2255.
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you
about
this...
this
possibility?
sometimes
there
are...
there
are
claims
in
which
there
are
two
bases
for
challenging
the
competence
of
counsel.
assume
that
one
of
them
is
plain
on
the
face
of
the
record,
he
didn't
object
to...
you
have
a
whole
bunch
of,
line
of
interrogation
was
plainly
improper,
and
the
second
ground
is
not
plain
on
the
record.
supposing
he
raises
the
first
ground
on
direct
appeal
and
loses.
is
he
barred,
in
your
view,
from
raising
the
second
ground
on
collateral
review?
unknown
speaker
and--
unknown
speaker
--within
that
20
to
40
percent,
whatever
it
may
be,
do
you
have
any
kind
of
a
rough
guess
as
to
the
number
of
instances
of
this
issue
that
arise?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
how...
how
many
times
within
that
20
to
40
percent
category
do
we
get
into
an
argument
later
on
as
to
whether
2255
can
be
availed
of
because,
in
fact,
a...
a
record
was
sufficiently
developed
to...
to
raise
the...
the
claim
on
direct?
how...
how
many
cases
are
there?
unknown
speaker
so
it's...
it's
hard
to
say
what
the
sort
of
cost
to
the
system,
if
there
is
one,
would
be
of
going
one
way
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
under
the
second
circuit
rule,
if
the
defendant
is
represented
by
the
public
defender's
office
in
the
trial
court,
and
then
on
appeal,
the
public
defender's
office
continues
to
represent
him
but
by
a
different
lawyer,
they
have
different...
does
that...
is
that
a
different
lawyer
within
the
meaning
of
the
second
circuit
rule,
or
is
it
the
same
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i--
