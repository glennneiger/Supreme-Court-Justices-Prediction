mr.
dreeben,
aren't
you
understating
the...
the
effects
of...
of
the
burning
cross?
this
statute
was
passed
in
what
year?
justice
clarence
thomas
now,
it's
my
understanding
that
we
had
almost
100
years
of
lynching
and
activity
in
the
south
by
the
knights
of
camellia
and...
and
the
ku
klux
klan,
and
this
was
a
reign
of
terror
and
the
cross
was
a
symbol
of
that
reign
of
terror.
was...
isn't
that
significantly
greater
than
intimidation
or
a
threat?
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
my
fear
is,
mr.
dreeben,
that
you're
actually
understating
the
symbolism
on...
of
and
the
effect
of
the
cross,
the
burning
cross.
i...
i
indicated,
i
think,
in
the
ohio
case
that
the
cross
was
not
a
religious
symbol
and
that
it
has...
it
was
intended
to
have
a
virulent
effect.
and
i...
i
think
that
what
you're
attempting
to
do
is
to
fit
this
into
our
jurisprudence
rather
than
stating
more
clearly
what
the
cross
was
intended
to
accomplish
and,
indeed,
that
it
is
unlike
any
symbol
in
our
society.
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
it's...
it's
actually
more
than
minorities.
justice
clarence
thomas
there's
certain
groups.
justice
clarence
thomas
and
i...
i
just...
my
fear
is
that
the...
there
was
no
other
purpose
to
the
cross.
there
was
no
communication
of
a
particular
message.
it
was
intended
to
cause
fear--
justice
clarence
thomas
--and
to
terrorize
a
population.
