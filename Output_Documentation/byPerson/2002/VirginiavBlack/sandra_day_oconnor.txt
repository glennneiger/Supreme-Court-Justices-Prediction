mr.
hurd,
i...
there's
one
part
of
the
statute
that
may
be
troublesome,
and
that
is
the
prima
facie
evidence
provision.
i
suppose
you
could
have
a
cross-burning,
for
instance,
in
a
play,
in
a
theater,
something
like
that,
which
in
theory
shouldn't
violate
the
statute,
but
here's
the
prima
facie
evidence
provision.
would
you
like
to
comment
about
that,
and
in
the
process,
would
you
tell
me
if
you
think
it's
severable,
or
what's
the
story
on
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
page?
are
you
talking
about
the
joint
appendix?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
where
would
that
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
you...
maybe
you
should
tell
us
later,
and
proceed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
fall
under
the
fighting
words
notion,
or
is
it
a
separate
category
of
constitutionally
proscribable
speech
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
why
isn't
this
just
a
regulation
of
a
particularly
virulent
form
of
intimidation?
and
why
can't
the
state
regulate
such
things?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
is
for
the
very
reasons
we've
explored
this
morning.
what
if
i
think
it
is?
why
can't
the
state
regulate
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
why
shouldn't
we
apply--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
o'brien
test?
why...
why
some
tougher
test
than
that
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
this
statute--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--this
statute
incorporates
the
intent
to
intimidate
feature.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--this
seems
to
fall
within
the
first
exception
mentioned
in
r.a.v..
this
does
address
conduct
and
with
a
certain
intent.
i
mean,
to
apply
r.a.v.
is
to
extend
r.a.v.--

the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.01-1107,
virginia
against
black
will
be
announced
by
justice
o’connor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
the
respondents,
barry
black,
richard
elliott,
and
jonathan
o’mara
were
separately
convicted
of
violating
virginia’s
cross-burning
statute.
in
august
1998,
barry
black
led
a
ku
klux
klan
rally;
at
the
conclusion
of
the
rally,
the
klan
burned
a
cross.
black
was
charged
with
burning
a
cross
with
the
intent
to
intimidate.
the
jury
was
instructed
in
accordance
with
the
model
jury
instructions
that
the
burning
of
a
cross
by
itself
is
sufficient
evidence
from
which
you
may
infer
the
required
intent.
in
may
1998,
richard
elliott
and
jonathan
o’mara
attempted
to
burn
a
cross
on
the
lawn
of
elliot’s
neighbor
and
were
charged
under
cross-burning
statute.
after
all
the
respondents
were
convicted,
they
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
arguing
that
the
cross-burning
statute
is
unconstitutional.
the
virginia
supreme
court
reversed
all
the
convictions
holding
that
the
virginia
cross-burning
statute
is
analytically
indistinguishable
from
the
ordinance
found
unconstitutional
by
this
court
in
the
decision
a
few
years
ago
of
r.a.v.
versus
st.
paul.
the
virginia
court
also
held
that
the
prima
facie
evidence
provision
of
virginia’s
cross-burning
statute
renders
that
statute
overbroad.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
with
respect
to
the
black
conviction,
and
we
vacate
and
remand
its
judgment
with
respect
to
elliott
and
o’mara.
we
hold
that
as
state
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
may
ban
cross-burning
carried
out
with
the
intent
to
intimidate.
while
a
burning
cross
does
not
always
convey
a
message
of
intimidation.
often
the
cross
burner
intends
that
the
recipients
of
the
message
fear
for
their
lives,
and
when
a
cross-burning
is
used
to
intimidate
few
if
any
messages
are
more
powerful.
the
hallmark
of
the
protection
of
free
speech
under
the
first
amendment
is
to
allow
free
trade
and
ideas.
the
protection
supported
by
the
first
amendment
however
is
not
absolute
and
the
government
may
prohibit
true
threats.
true
threats
encompass
those
statements
where
the
seeker
means
to
communicate
a
serious
expression
of
an
intent
to
commit
an
act
of
unlawful
violence
to
a
particular
individual.
intimidation
in
the
constitutionally
proscribable
sense
of
the
word
is
a
type
of
true
threat.
the
first
amendment
permits
virginia
to
outlaw
a
cross-burnings
done
with
the
intent
to
intimidate
because
burning
a
cross
is
a
particularly
virulent
form
of
intimidation.
this
type
of
cross-burning
is
fully
consistent
with
our
holding
in
r.a.v.
in
r.a.v.,
we
specifically
stated
that
a
particular
type
of
content
discrimination
does
not
violate
the
first
amendment
when
the
basis
for
it
consists
entirely
of
the
very
reason
its
interclass
of
speech
is
proscribable.
instead
of
prohibiting
all
intimidating
messages,
virginia
may
choose
to
regulate
this
subset
of
intimidating
messages
in
light
of
cross-burning’s
long
and
pernicious
history.
a
plurality
of
the
court
consisting
of
myself,
the
chief
justice,
justice
stevens,
and
justice
breyer
withhold
that
that
prima
facie
provision
as
interpreted
through
the
jury
instruction
given
in
black’s
case
is
unconstitutional.
the
act
of
burning
a
cross
may
mean
that
the
person
in
engaging
in
constitutionally
proscribable
intimidation
or
it
may
mean
only
that
the
person
is
engaged
in
core
political
speech.
the
prima
facie
provision
blurs
the
line
between
these
meanings.
the
first
amendment
does
not
permit
such
a
shortcut.
thus,
black’s
conviction
cannot
stand,
and
the
judgment
as
to
him
is
affirmed.
because
the
prima
facie
provision
was
not
at
issue,
in
the
way
that
the
cases
of
elliott
and
o’mara
were
handled,
we
vacate
and
remand
the
virginia
supreme
court
judgment
as
to
those
two
respondents.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
scalia
joined
by
justice
thomas
as
to
parts
i
and
ii
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
as
to
those
sections
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part;
justice
souter
joined
by
justices
kennedy
and
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and

thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
