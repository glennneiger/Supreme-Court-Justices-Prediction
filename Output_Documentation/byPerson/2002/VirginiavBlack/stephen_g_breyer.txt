justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
case
of
a
desert,
he's
out
in
the
desert,
and
he's
burning
the
cross
for
symbolic
purposes
and
nobody
else
is
around.
i
guess
wouldn't
the
judge
have
to
set
aside
the
conviction
on...
on
first
amendment
grounds.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
i
thought
there
would
be
a
first
amendment
problem
in
the
unusual
hypothetical
instance
of
the
desert,
where
they
gave
this
instruction
and
the
very
thirsty
jury
convicted
the
person
under
this
instruction.
were
that
to
happen,
then
that
might
violate
the
first
amendment
since
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
case
that
this
was
going
to
intimidate
a
person,
and
the
only
basis
for
a
conviction
would
have
been
the
instruction
of
the
state.
and
under
those
circumstances,
i
guess
the
state
instruction
permitting
conviction
would
violate
the
first
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
necessarily.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
agree
it's
unusual.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
words...
words
are
even
more.
i
mean,
your
argument
applies
a
fortiori
to
words.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
you
could
have
statutes,
if
the
need
were
great,
that
forbid
you
from
using
certain
words
with
a
certain
intent
like,
for
example,
impersonating
somebody
or...
or
counterfeiting,
or...
i
mean,
if...
i've
never
heard
of
a
case
which
said
you
couldn't
have
a
statute
that
in...
if
the
circumstances
were
right,
forbid
a
person
to
use
certain
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can't
have
that?
to
have
a
statute
that
says--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
cannot
say
i
am
the
president
with
the
intent
to
confuse
people
that
i'm
the
president,
i
mean,
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that's
not
normal.
i...
i...
that's
why--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
is
a
crime
to
impersonate
the
great
seal
of
the
united
states--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
purposes
of
obtaining
money.
it
violates
the
first
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
would
think
then
that
if
the
test
suggests
that
you
cannot
have
a
statute
which
says
you
cannot
use
the
words,
i'll
kill
you,
with
an
intent
to
kill
somebody
or
threaten
him,
then
there's
something
wrong
with
the
test,
not
that
there's
something
wrong
with
the
statute.
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--correct,
they
might.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
we
put
in
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fails
to
do
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
guess
what...
you
have
a
very
interesting
point.
and
as
i've
been
thinking
about
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
a
difficulty,
possible
difficulty
with
it
is
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
protect
words.
it
protects
use
of
words
for
certain
purposes.
and
it
doesn't
protect,
for
example,
a...
a
symbol.
it
protects
a
thing
that
counts
as
a
symbol
when
used
for
symbolic
purposes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
just
as
it
doesn't
protect
the
words,
i
will
kill
you,
but
protects
them
when
used
in
a
play,
but
not
when
used
as
a
threat--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
it
doesn't
protect
the
burning
of
the
cross
when
used
as
a
threat--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
not
as
a
symbol.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
we
have
a
statute
that
says
you
can
use
it
as
a
symbol,
but
you
can't
use
it
as
a
threat.
and
therefore,
the
first
amendment
doesn't
apply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
that's
the
right
analysis,
then
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
you
just
to
address...
but
it's
hard
for
you
because
you
have
clients
with
different
interests
here
perhaps.
but...
but
if...
if
it's
right
that
you
can
ban
speech,
i.e.,
the
use
of
words
for
purposes
of
threatening
people
with
bodily
harm,
which
i
think
we
can,
then
what
about
this
prima
facie
prohibition?
the
way
i
was
thinking
about
it,
to
get
you
to
respond,
is
if
you
did
have
a
statute
that
was
constitutional
that
said
it
is
a
crime
to
use
the
words,
i
will
kill
you,
with
the
intent
to
threaten
someone
with
death.
that
statute
might
go
on
to
say,
and
the
jury
may
infer
from
the
use
of
the
words
themselves
on
a
particular
occasion
that
the
threat
existed.
and
i
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
all
that's
true,
then
i
guess
that
the...
the
prima
facie
presumption
here
is
no
different.
it
says
the
jury
may
infer
from
the...
the
burning
cross
on
a
particular
occasion,
just
like
the
use
of
the
words,
i
kill
you,
on
a
particular
occasion--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
argument
is
not
the
same
with...
i
mean,
it's
an...
your
argument,
i
take
it,
is
that
if
you
actually
have
a
statute
that
criminalizes
the
use
of
particular
words,
or...
or
the
burning
of
a...
of
a
symbol,
even
if
you
qualify
that
by
saying
you...
it's
criminal
to
use
them
for
certain
purposes,
you've
monopolized
those
words
because
people
who
are
using
them
from
different
purposes
will
be
afraid
to
use
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
they
can't
express
what
they
want
even
though
that
expression
is
not
to
hurt
someone.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right,
yes.
