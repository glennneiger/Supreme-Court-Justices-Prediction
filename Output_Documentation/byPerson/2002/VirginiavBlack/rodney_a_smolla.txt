mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
heart
of
our
argument
is
that
when
the
state
targets
a
particular
symbol
or
a
particular
symbolic
ritual,
it
engages
in
content
and
viewpoint
discrimination
of
the
type
forbidden
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
justice
scalia,
i
think--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--i
think
that
a
core
element
of
our
argument
is
that
there
is
a
fundamental
first
amendment
difference
between
brandishing
a
cross,
and
brandishing
a
gun.
the
physical
properties
of
the
gun
as
a
weapon
add
potency
to
the
threat,
and
so
if
the
state
makes
a
threat
committed
with
a
firearm
an
especially
heinous
type
of
threat,
it
is
acting
within
the
confines
of
what
is
permissible
under
r.a.
v.
because
it
is
creating
a
subclass
of
threat
and
defining
that
subclass
of
threat
for
the
same
reasons
that
allow
it
to
define
the
outer
perimeter
of
threat
law,
things
going
to
the
danger
posed
by
that
threat.
but
the
properties
of
the
cross
are
not
physical
properties,
and
the
burning
element
of
a
burning
cross
are
not
what
communicate
the
threat.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
justice
souter,
i
think
that
our
argument
is
that
in
fact
it
works
the
reverse
way,
that
what
the
cross
and
the
burning
cross
have
acquired
as
a
kind
of
secondary
meaning,
somewhat
akin
to
the
way
that
trademarks
acquire
secondary
meaning
in
intellectual
property
law,
are
a
multiplicity
of
messages.
undoubtedly
a
burning
cross
identified
as...
as
effectively
the
trademark
of
the
ku
klux
klan
carries
horrible
connotations
of
terrorism
of
the
kind--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--no,
your
honor.
respectfully
i
think
that
that
overstates
what
is
being
communicated.
any
symbol
in
its
pristine
state
that
has
gathered
reverence
in
our
society...
the
american
flag,
the
star
of
david,
the
cross,
the
symbols
of
government...
is
a
powerful,
emotional
symbol
in...
in
its
revered
state.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
your
honor,
the
word
scared
is
important
in
answering
your
question
because
it's...
it's
what
we
mean
by
being
scared,
or
what
we
mean
by
being
intimidated.
if
i
see
a
burning
cross,
my
stomach
may
churn.
i
may
feel
a
sense
of
loathing,
disgust,
a
vague
sense
of--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--of
being
intimidated
because
i
associate
it--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--but
that's
not
fear
of
bodily
harm.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
your
honor,
i
concede
that.
however...
however--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--as...
as
powerful
as
that
point
is...
and
i
totally
accept
it,
and
totally
accept
the
history
that
justice
thomas
has...
has
recounted,
and
that
the
united
states
recounts
in
its
brief
as
accurate.
as
powerful
as
all
of
those
points
are,
there's
not
a
single
interest
that
society
seeks
to
protect
in
protecting
that
victim
that
cannot
be
vindicated
perfectly
as
well,
exactly
as
well
with
no
fall-off
at
all,
by
content-neutral
alternatives,
not
merely
general
run-of-the-mill
threat
laws,
or
incitement
laws,
or
intimidation
laws
which
may
have
an
antiseptic
and
sterile
quality
about
them.
you
can
go
even
beyond
that--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--your
honor,
it
is
not
a
particularly
virulent
form
of
intimidation.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
because,
justice
o'connor,
it
is
also
an
especially
virulent
form
of
expression
on
ideas
relating
to
race,
religion,
politics--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--justice--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--justice
kennedy,
it
is
the
wisconsin
versus
mitchell
bias
enhancement-style
model
where
the
interest
of
the
state
goes
beyond
just
preventing
physical
crime.
it
goes
to
preventing
racism,
acts
of
violence,
threats,
intimidation
that
are
done
out
of
bias
and
animus.
that
captures
the
fullness
of
all
the
conceivable
state
interests
that
there
could
possibly
be--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--but...
but,
your
honor,
in
any
instance
in
which
the
state
were
operating
upon
some
conduct
that
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
to
proscribe,
such
as
a
threat,
the
state
could
then
enhance
the
penalty.
if
you
threaten
out
of
racial
animus,
you
get
double
the
penalty,
triple
the
penalty.
and
that
would
work
in
any
cross-burning
case--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--yes,
your
honor,
and
even
more--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--the...
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
kennedy,
lies
in
wisconsin
versus
mitchell
where
this
court
held
that
the
mere
evidentiary
use
of
speech
to
prove
intent
does
not
implicate
the
first
amendment.
and
although
the
line
is
thin,
it
is
gigantic
in
terms
of
our
first
amendment
values.
it
is
the
difference--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--it
would
not
be
permissible,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
it--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--would
not
be
permissible
is
the
cross
has
acquired
this
meaning
as
an
ideological
symbol.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
that
is
precisely
our
argument.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
your
honor,
r.a.v.
is
the
only
case
that
dealt
squarely
with
this
puzzle
of
what
happens
when
you're
dealing
with
a
category
of
speech
that
you
have
the
right
to
proscribe,
and
then
you
draw
gratuitous
content
or
viewpoint-based
distinctions
within
it.
however,
justice
stevens,
i
would
say
that
it
isn't
alone
in
this
court's
powerful
condemnation
of
viewpoint
discrimination,
and
a
key
element
to
this
court's
first
amendment
history
is
that
we
don't
want
to
cut
matters
too
finely.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
well,
the...
the
fact
pattern
in
r.a.v.
was
identical
to
one
of
the
fact
patterns
here.
it
was
going
on
to
the
yard
of
an
african-american
family--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--and
burning
a
cross
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
your
honor.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
the...
the--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--and...
and
at
the
core
of
our
argument,
justice
scalia,
is
the
claim
that
the
concept
of
viewpoint
discrimination
is,
and
ought
to
be
broad
enough
to
encompass
not
only
viewpoint
discrimination
articulated
linguistically,
the
way
that
it
was
done
in
the
statute
in
r.a.v.,
but
also
viewpoint
discrimination
through
the
singling
out
of
a
symbol
because
symbols
acquire
meaning
in
precisely
the
same
way
that
words
acquire
meaning.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
it
does,
justice
breyer.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
justice
breyer,
the...
the
first
amendment
speaks
to
this,
and...
and
it's--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--in
fact--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--the...
the
normal...
the
normal
legislative
process,
justice
breyer,
is
not
to
name
the
words,
not
to
put
in
the
statute
if
you
utter
these--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--but
to
describe...
but
to
describe
the
conduct
that
you
are
attempting
to
get
at,
and
then
various
combinations
of
words
may
fit
into
it.
but
let's
take
the
example
of
naming
a
set
of
words.
even
that
is
enormously
problematic
for
first
amendment
purposes.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
the--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--but...
but
the...
but
the...
it
could,
your
honor,
in...
in
an
appropriate
circumstance.
take--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--we
are
certainly
saying
that,
and--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--we...
we
say
that--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--that
is
a...
that
is
a
fair
characterization
of
the
question.
and...
and
accepting
strict
scrutiny
as
the...
the
test
here,
but
strict
scrutiny
we
would
argue
bumped
up
a
bit
in
its
intensity
if
this
is
viewpoint
discrimination
because--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--this
court's
been
hostile
to
viewpoint--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--your
honor,
whether
you
apply
o'brien
or
strict
scrutiny,
it's
our
submission
we
win
because
when
you
get
to
the
point
at
which
you
look
at
alternatives,
there
are
content-neutral
alternatives
that
work
perfectly
as
well.
but
to
answer
directly
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
this
court
has
never
allowed
the
use
of
the
o'brien
test
or
any
of
the
cousins
of
o'brien,
such
as
the
secondary
effects
doctrine
or
time,
place,
or
manner
jurisprudence,
when
the
harm
that
the
government
seeks
to
prevent
is
a
harm
that
flows
from
the
communicative
impact
of
the
expression.
and
there
is
no
getting
around
the
fact
that
the
harm
the
government
seeks
to
prevent
here
indubitably
flows
only
from
the
formation
of
this
symbol.
if
i--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--your
honor,
take
the...
take
the
words...
take
the
words,
if
you
do
that
again,
i
swear
i'll
kill
you.
those
words
in
a
given
context
might
be
breakfast
banter,
might
be
a
joke.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
it
might
be
something
a
teacher--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--says
to
a
student,
or
might
be
a
true
objective
threat.
and
the...
a
core
element
of
this
court's
commitment
to
freedom
of
speech
has
been
to
separate
abstract
advocacy
from
palpable
harm.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
if
it
meets
the
watts
true
threats
test,
it...
it
is
permissible.
this
law...
this
law,
however,
is
a
fusion
of
true
threat
law,
and
a
gratuitous
addition
to
the
true
threat
law,
cross-burning.
the
law
would
have
been--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--perfectly
sufficient--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
the
federal
model,
for
example.
there
are
a
variety
of
federal
civil
rights
laws
that
punish
conduct
that
the
united
states
uses
routinely
to
punish
acts
of
cross-burning
are
perfectly
permissible.
and
the
difference,
which
is
enormous
for
first
amendment
purposes,
is
that
both
at
the
front
end
of
that
legislation
and
at
the
back
end,
there
is
breathing
space
for
the
first
amendment.
it's
important
to
remember
that
our
first
amendment
jurisprudence
is
not
just
about
deliberate
censorship
and
realized
censorship.
it
is
also
about
possibility,
about
chilling
effect,
and
about
breathing...
about
breathing
space.
in
effect,
in
virginia--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--you
burn
a
cross
at
your
peril.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
that
is
true,
justice
o'connor,
but
even
if
it
does,
the
learning
of
r.a.v.,
we'd
submit,
is
that
that
alone
does
not
rest
in
the
statute.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
a
law
can't
be
half
constitutional.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
your
honor,
it's
our
submission
that
in
fact
the
two
cases
are
identical,
and
the
reason
they
don't
seem
identical
perhaps
is
that
it
is
harder...
it
is
harder...
to
locate
the
viewpoint
and
content
discrimination
in
our
minds
when
we
think
of
the
burning
cross
than
when
we
think
of
the
language
of
r.a.v.,
which
talked
about
anger
or
resentment
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
creed.
and
that
may
well
be
because
of
the
kind
of
pavlovian
connection
that
you
have
identified
where
we
feel
this
loathing,
and
we
feel
this...
this
generalized
fear
when
we
see
the
sight
of
the
burning
cross.
but
our
point
is
that
ought
never
be
sufficient
because
even
if
at
a
given
moment
in
time,
you
could
take
some
symbol
and
freeze
it
and
you
could
say
at
this
second
this
symbol
always
seems
associated
with
violence...
imagine
you
had
a
terrorist
group
that
was
on
a
serial
killing
spree
and
every
time
they
committed
an
act
of
violence,
they
left
a
little
calling
card,
and
that
symbol
became
a
terribly
frightening--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--that's
correct.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
that
is
correct.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
that
is
correct.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
that
is...
that--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--and...
and--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--your
honor,
that...
that
everything
you
said
up
until
the
very
end--
[laughter]
--we
would
not
accept.
i
have
a...
i
have
a
hunch
i
have
to
at
least
say
that
much.
and...
and,
justice
breyer,
it
comes
to
this,
that
you
cannot
make
the
judgment
that
this
law
in
its
actual
impact
only
penalizes
those
acts
of
cross-burning
that
result
in
threat.
it
certainly
chills,
justice
breyer,
a
wide
range
of
expression,
as
it
did
in
this
case,
that
cannot
plausibly
be
understood
as
a
threat
of
bodily
harm
in
any
realistic
sense.
every
time
the
ku
klux
klan
conducts
one
of
its
rallies,
at
the
height
of
its
rally,
it
burns
a
large
cross,
and
it
plays
a
hymn
such
as
the
old
rugged
cross,
or
onward
christian
soldiers
or
amazing
grace,
and
this
is
a
ritual
that
it
engages
in.
now,
it
is
inconceivable...
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
that
says
that
every
time
the
klan
does
that,
that
is,
in
fact,
a
true
threat.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
your
honor,
but
the--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--the...
the...
all
the
statute
requires
is
that
it
be
visible
to
others.
and
of
course,
the
first
amendment
value
here
in
our
view
is
that
speech,
particularly
disturbing
and
offensive
speech
that
runs
contrary
to
our...
our
mainstream
values
that
the
majority
of
us
embrace,
is
ineffective
unless
it
is
put
out
to
the
world
where
others
can
see
it.
and
as
justice
brandeis
said
in
whitney
versus
california
in
his
concurring
opinion,
you
don't
make
the
world
safer
by
driving
the
speech
of
hate
groups
such
as
the
ku
klux
klan
underground.
in
many
societies
in
this
world,
you
can
ban
racial
supremacist
groups.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
and
i
accept
that,
your
honor.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
there's
a
world
of
difference,
your
honor,
and
the
difference
is
that
the
words,
i
will
kill
you,
are
words
of
threat
that
have
no
additional
emanations.
they
have
no
additional
secondary
meaning
in
this
society
either
as
the
symbol
of
a
group,
or
as
the
symbol
of
an
idea
such
as
bigotry.
they
partake
of
the
same
rationale,
the
same
defining
parameters
that
allow
you
to
attack
threats
in
the
first
instance.
whereas
the
burning
cross...
the
burning
cross,
whether
it's
the
19th
century
burning
cross
before
the
klan
began,
or
today,
introduces
a
symbol...
first
of
all,
just
a
cross
before
we
get
to
the
burning
part,
a
symbol
that
you
must
concede
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
religious
symbols
in...
in
human
history.
it
is
the...
it
is
the
symbol
of
christianity,
the
symbol
of
the
crucifixion
of
christ.
when
the
cross
is
burned,
in
much
the
same
way
as
when
the
flag
is
burned,
undoubtedly
the
burner
is
playing
on
that
underlying
positive
repository
of
meaning
to
make
the
intense
negative
point,
often
a
point
that
strikes
as
horrible
and
as
evil
and
disgusting,
but
that's--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--what
the
person
is
trying
to
do.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
justice
ginsburg,
i
only
partially
accept
that...
that
dichotomy.
in
fact,
when
the
klan
engages
in
cross-burning,
as
it
did
in
brandenburg
versus
ohio,
and
as
it
did
here,
it
is...
it
is
a
melange
of
messages.
yes,
to
some
degree,
it
is
a
horizontal
message
of
hate
speech,
the
klan
members
attacking
jews
and
catholics
and
african-americans
and
all
of
the
various
people
that
have
been
the...
the
point
of
its
hatred
over
the
years.
but
it's
also
engaged
in
dissent
and
in
a
political
message.
if
you
remember
in
brandenburg
versus
ohio,
brandenburg
says
if
the
congress
doesn't
change
things,
some
revenges
will
have
to
be
taken.
in
this
case,
president
clinton
was
talked
about
by
the
klan
members.
hillary
clinton
was
talked
about
by
the
klan
members.
racial
preferences
and
the
idea
that
the...
where
they're
using
taxes
to
support
minority
groups.
there
is
a
jumble
of
political
anger,
of--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--they
may
not,
justice
stevens.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
justice
stevens,
i
accept
that.
but
i...
i'm
merely
making
the
argument
that
you
can
fit
a
phrase
such
as
the
words,
i
will
kill
you,
within
the
exceptions
to
r.a.v.
in
a
way
that
you
cannot
fit
cross-burning
within
the
exceptions
to
r.a.v.
or
flag-burning
within
the
exceptions
to
r.a.v.
because
cross
and
flag-burning
and
any
symbol,
the
burning
of
the
star
of
david,
the
swastika...
virginia
has
a
law
virtually
identical
to
the
cross-burning
law
that
singles
out
the
swastika.
the...
you
could...
you
can
go
through
the
universe
of
symbols--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--and
chilled--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--and
not
merely
monopolize,
justice
breyer,
but--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--but
chilled
the
use
of
that
combination
of
words
or
chilled
the
use
of
that
symbol--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--so
that
in
effect
it
becomes--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--justice
kennedy,
there's
no
free
ride
if
the
government
employs
content-neutral
alternatives,
which
really--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--your
honor,
because
the
first
amendment
requires
that
we
flip
the
question.
it
is
not
why
can't
the
government
single
out
this
particular
form
of
expression.
it
is
why
do
you
need
to.
and
if
you
have
no
need
to--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--your
honor--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--justice
scalia,
you
do
not
need
to
use
the
least
restrictive
alternative
when
you
are
not
regulating
a
fundamental
right,
or
engaged
in
a
suspect
classification.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
except,
your
honor,
under...
under
the
brandenburg
test...
excuse
me...
under
the
o'brien
test,
the
government
has
functional
elements
of...
of...
that
relate
to
the
weapon
that
allow
it
to
cite
things
utterly
unrelated
to
the
content
of
expression
that
empower
it
to
say
you
may
not...
you
may
not
brandish
a
weapon.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
that...
that
it's...
it's
like
the
difference,
justice
scalia,
between
burning
a
draft
card
and
burning
a
cross
or
burning
a
flag,
that...
that
the
reason
o'brien...
the
draft
card
case...
allowed
the
government
to
punish
burning
the
draft
card
was
that
the
draft
card
had
a
functional
purpose...
the
administration
of
the
selective
service
system...
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
was
being
expressed
when
one
burned
the
draft
card.
the
gun
is
like
that.
when
the
government
says
you
may
not
threaten
someone
by
brandishing
a
gun,
there
is
a
functional
element
to
the
gun.
it's
a
weapon
that
the
government
can
cite
as
its
basis.
but
a
symbol
only
has
symbolic
meaning.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
it
is...
it
is--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--it
is...
it's
still...
it's
still
a
weapon,
your
honor,
and...
and
it
is
gigantically
different
from
a
cross.
if...
if
i...
take
a
torch.
what
would
be
the
difference
between
brandishing
a
torch
and
brandishing
a
cross?
if
i...
if
i
take
two
wooden
sticks--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
and
that
100
years
of
history
is
on
the
side
of
freedom
of
speech,
that
it
is
100
years
of
history
that
a
particular
group
has...
has
capitalized
on
this
particular
ritual
to
make
not
only
points
that
are
threatening,
but
to
advance
their
agenda.
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
your
honor,
i
think
the
tie-breaker
is
what
i've
kept
coming
back
to
a
number
of
times,
which
is
really
would
there
be
any
fall-off
through
content-neutral
alternatives,
and
if
there
would
not
be
any
fall-off
through
content-neutral
alternatives,
then
err
on
the
side
of
freedom
of
speech.
imagine
that
you
have
two
rallies
going
on
side-by-side.
the...
the
klan
is
going
to
make...
engage
in
a
rally,
and
then
a
group
that
wants
to
counter
the
klan's
message,
a
christian
group,
has
a
counter-rally
in
a
public
forum
in
richmond.
and
imagine
that
at
the
height
of
those
two
rallies,
the
klan
ignites
its
cross.
under
this
statute,
the
klan
can
be
prosecuted,
the
other
group
cannot.
it's--
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
--then...
then
round
them
up,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
rodney
a.
smolla
and...
and
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
again
to
think
about
this
in
content-neutral
terms,
the
first
amendment
would
not
forbid
the
government
charging
the
klan
in
the
case
that
we
have
with
an
ordinary,
run-of-the-mill
threat
law,
or
a
hate
crime
law,
such
as
a
bias
enhancement
statute,
and
then
introducing
the
fact
that
the
cross
was
burned
as
evidence
of
the
threat,
and
as
part
of
the
emotional
atmospheric
of
the
case
to
try
to
convince
a
jury
of
the
heinousness
and
the
seriousness
of
the
threat.
that
was
approved
by
this
court
in
wisconsin
versus
mitchell,
and
it
may
seem
not
worth
the
candle.
it
may
seem
that
it's
just
a
way
to
get
to
the
same
result
through
some
other
formality,
but
our
position
is
that
that
is
enormous
for
first
amendment
purposes.
it
is
the
central
divide
of
modern
first
amendment
law
in
which
the
court
insists
that
you
use
content-neutral
alternatives
when
you
can
accomplish
the
governmental
ends
equally
well
through
them.
thank
you,
your
honor.
