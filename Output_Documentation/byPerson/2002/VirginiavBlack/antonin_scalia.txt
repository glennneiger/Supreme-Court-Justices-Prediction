justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
key
here
is
that
this
is
not
just
speech.
it
is
not
just
speech.
it's
action
that...
that
is
intended
to
convey
a
message.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely...
surely
your
state
could
make
it
unlawful
to
brandish...
brandish
an
automatic
weapon
with
the
intent
of...
of
intimidating
somebody,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that...
that's
fine
if
you
use
the
term
prima
facie
case,
which
is
what
the
statute
says.
but
the
instruction
here
said
the
burning
of
a
cross
by
itself
is
sufficient
evidence
from
which
you
may
infer
the
required
intent.
and
you
think
that's
an
accurate...
an
accurate
conveyance
to
the
jury
of
what
is
meant
by
prima
facie
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
then
it
goes
on
to
say
the
burning
of
a
cross
is
sufficient
evidence
from
which
you
may
infer
the...
the
required
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
need...
no,
not
necessarily.
but
that
seems
to
me
to
be
much
more
than
what
you
now
describe
as
the
consequence
of
a
prima
facie
case.
just...
just
one
that
gets
you
past
a...
a
motion
to
dismiss.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
it's
sufficient
evidence
to
find
it
if...
if
that's
all
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
every
due
process
violation
in
a
first
amendment
case
is
a
first
amendment
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
a
federal
statute
that
makes
it...
makes
it
an
offense
to
go
on
the
highway
wearing
a...
wearing
a
sheet?
in
disguise.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it...
is
it
unlawful
in
virginia
to
put
somebody
in
fear
of
bodily
harm
in
some
other
fashion,
not
to
burn
a
cross,
but
to
say
i'm
going
to
lynch
you?
is
that...
is
that
unlawful
in
virginia?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
sort
of
peculiar,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
surely...
surely
one
can
burn
a
cross
in
the
sanctity
of
one's
bedroom.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
about
the
symbol
of
brandishing
an
automatic
weapon
in...
in
somebody's
face?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
next.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
dare
say
that
you
would
rather
see
a
man
with
a...
with
a
rifle
on
your
front
lawn...
if
you
were
a
black
man
at
night,
you'd
rather
see
a
man
with
a
rifle
than
see
a
burning
cross
on
your
front
lawn.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
whole
purpose
of
that
is...
is
to
terrorize.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
involved
in
r.a.v.?
was
it...
was
it
activity?
what
kind
of
activity
was
involved.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
what
was
made
a
crime
was
the
burning
it
with
a
particular
motivation,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
the
mere
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
all
it...
all
it...
all
you're
saying
is
that
heightened
scrutiny
applies.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
you're
saying.
you
can't
possibly
say
more
than
that
once
you
acknowledge
that...
that
symbols
can
be
proscribed.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
the
question
before
us
is
whether
burning
a
cross
is
such
a
terrorizing
symbol
in
american...
in
american
culture
that
even
on
the
basis
of
heightened
scrutiny,
it's
okay
to
proscribe
it.
that's
basically
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
intended
to
be--
--the
requirement
of
intent.
--a
threat,
you
can
get
it.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
if
it's
intended
to
be
a
threat,
it
can
proscribed.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
isn't,
so
long
as
the
klan
doesn't
do
it
in...
in
sight
of
a
public
highway,
or
on
somebody
else's
property,
there's
not
a
chance
that
this
statute
would
apply
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
to
do
in
sight
of
a
public
highway?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
wait,
wait.
i
think...
i
don't
think
our
cases
say
you
have
to
use
the
least
restrictive
alternative.
i'm
sure
there
are
other
ways
of
getting
at
the
person
who
brandishes
an
automatic
weapon,
but
surely
you
can
make
brandishing
an
automatic
weapon
a
crime--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
though
there
are
other
ways
you
could
get
at
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
symbol...
i
mean,
that's
a
symbol
too.
brandishing
a
weapon
is
a
symbol
just
as
burning
a
cross
is
a
symbol.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but--
--it's
an
unloaded
gun.
this
is
an
unloaded
gun
that's
being
brandished.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
once
it's
unloaded,
it's
nothing
but
a
symbol.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
nothing
but
a
symbol.
