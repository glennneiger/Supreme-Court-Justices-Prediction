mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
virginia
has
singled
out
cross-burning
with
the
intent
to
intimidate
because
it
is
a
particularly
threatening
form
of
such
conduct.
history
has
revealed
that
cross-burning
has
been
used
as
a
tool
to
intimidate
and
put
people
in
fear
of
bodily
violence
in
a
way
that
no
other
symbol
has
been
used.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
o'connor,
our
analysis
of
the
intimidation
element
is
that
it's
akin
to
a
threat
to
put
somebody
in
bodily
harm.
and
as
such--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--apart
from
the
presumption
or
prima
facie
case
provision
that
your
honor
called
attention
to
earlier,
the
prohibitory
language
of
the
statute
does
not
reach
cross-burning
when
it
is
done
solely
for
the
point
of
expressing
a
particular
view.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
o'connor,
it
raises
separate
issues
that
are
distinct
from
whether
a
cross-burning
statute
can
single
out
that
particular
activity
and
prohibit
it
on
the
basis
of
its
threatening--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
is,
but
the
virginia
supreme
court
approached
the
issue
by
first
asking
whether
the
cross-burning
provision,
insofar
as
it
targeted
cross-burning--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--ran
afoul
of
this
court's
decision
in
r.a.v.,
and
it
only
then
turned
to
the
prima
facie
case
provision--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
concluded
that
it
rendered
the
statute
overbroad.
the
united
states
has
not
taken
a
position
on
the
validity
of
the
prima
facie
case
provision,
which
does
raise
distinct
issues
because
it
could
allow
a
jury
in
certain
instances
to
infer
solely
from
the
act
of
cross-burning,
without
any
other
evidence
at
all--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
was
the
instruction
given
in
one
of
the
two
cases.
in
the
elliott
case,
there
was
no
instruction--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--whatsoever
on
the
prima
facie
case
provision,
and
so
elliott's
case
is
somewhat
similar...
differently
situated
from...
from
the
black
case.
but
a
cross-burning
statute
like
this
functions
not
like
a
fighting
words
statute
which
seeks
to
avert
breaches
of
the
peace
by
the
use
of
particularly
obnoxious
language
that
would
induce
anybody
to
strike
back
with
a
violent
reaction.
it
functions
instead
on
the
theory
that
a
signal
to
violence,
or
a
warning
that
violence
will
come
is
not
protected
within
the
first
amendment.
it
is
a
prohibited
form
of
conduct,
and
when
done
as
here
by
an
act
of
putting
a
flaming
cross
in
a
place
with
the
intent
to
actually
put
somebody
in
fear
of
bodily
harm,
it's
not
a
form
of
protected
conduct
that
directly
implicates
the
first
amendment.
it's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
scalia,
my
understanding
of
virginia
law
is
that
it
has
a...
a
written
threats
statute
which
would
cover
any
threat
of
any
kind
in
writing,
but
it
does
not
have
a
general
intimidation
or
threat
statute
that
would
reach
other
means
of
oral
expression.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
what
virginia
has
done
is
take
something
which
has
historically
been
used
as
a
particularly
dangerous
means
of
intimidation
because
it
has
so
often
been
followed
up
by
actual
violence
and
establish
a
prohibition
that
is
limited
to
that.
rather
than
sweeping
in
other
classes
of
speech
that
may
raise
questions
when
you
come
close
to
the
line
of
whether
it
is
or
isn't
intimidating
and
therefore
might
chill
free
expression,
virginia
has
chosen
to
focus
on
what
conduct
occurred
within
its
borders
that
caused
particular
harms.
and
what--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
is
a
common
law
of...
of
putting
somebody
in
fear
of
bodily
harm
through
the
tort
law.
and
there
were
similarly
antecedent
criminal
provisions
that
are--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
there
is
not,
justice
kennedy,
and
it's
crucial
to
underscore
why
that
is.
the
harms
that
can
be
brought
about
by
threat
statutes
are
not
only
putting
somebody
in
fear
of
bodily
harm
and
thereby
disrupting
their
movements,
but
providing
a
signal
that
the
violence
may
actually
occur.
it
may
not
occur
tomorrow,
the
next
day,
or
next
week,
but
it's
like
a
sword
of
damocles
hanging
over
the
person
whose
head...
who
has
been
threatened.
and
in
that
sense
it
creates
a
pervasive
fear
that
can
be
ongoing
for
a
considerable
amount
of
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
1952
originally.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
they're
coextensive,
justice
thomas,
because
it
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
mean
to
understate
it,
and
i
entirely
agree
with
your
honor's
description
of
how
the
cross
has
been
used
as
an
instrument
of
intimidation
against
minorities
in
this
country.
that
has
justified
14
states
in
treating
it
as
a
distinctive--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
absolutely
was,
and
for
that
reason
can
be
legitimately
proscribed
without
fear
that
the
focusing
on
a
cross...
burning
of
a
cross
with
the
intent
to
intimidate
would
chill
protected
expression.
this
is
a
very
different
case
than
the
r.a.v.
case
that
was
before
the
court.
there
the
court
was
confronted
with
a
statute
that
prohibited
the
use
of
language
based
on
particular
messages
of
group-based
hatred.
and
in
singling
out
speech
based
on
the
content,
the
state
was
expressing
disagreement
with
particular
messages.
in
the
virginia
statute,
and
in
the
other
statutes
that
the
states
have,
the
focus
is
not
on
any
particular
message.
it
is
on
the
effect
of
intimidation,
and
the
intent
to
create
a
climate
of
fear
and,
as
justice
thomas
has
said,
a
climate
of
terror.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
would,
justice
souter,
and
i
think
it's
for
the
reason
that
your
honor
pointed
out
in
his
concurrence
in
hill
versus
colorado.
merely
because
a
particular
activity
might
have
become
the
signature
of
a
certain
ideological
group
does
not
prevent
the
state
from
addressing
and
regulating
what
is
proscribable
about
that
activity.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that
would--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
would
raise
a
much
more
difficult
question
because
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
is
a
very
powerful
linkage
in
our
society
such
that
the
state
is
justified
in
singling
out
the
cross,
it
may
be
that
under
certain
contexts,
a
particular
individual
is
attempting
to
express
a
message
rather
than
attempting
to
intimidate.
and
it...
it
is
important
to
note
that
merely
expressing
a
message
of
race-based
hatred
is
not
something
that
the
state
can
proscribe--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there...
there
are...
there
are
hypothetical
cases
that
one
can
imagine,
the
desert,
the
bedroom--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
might
well
be,
justice
stevens,
but
i
think
that
a
law
that
is
more
tailored,
as
this
one
is,
and
reaches
those
acts
of
cross-burning
where
it
is
the
very
intent
of
the
actor
to
put
a
person
or
group
of
people
in
fear
of
bodily
harm
makes
it
quite
clear
that
a...
that
statute
aims
at
the
proscribable
feature
of
that
conduct
and
not
at
the
protected
feature,
namely
race-based
hatred.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
stevens,
may
i
answer?
justice
ginsburg,
the
inference
provision
is
problematic
because
it
does
raise
the
potential
that
a
wholly
protected
act
of
cross-burning,
which
this
court
might
find
within
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment,
could
serve
as
the
exclusive
source
of
evidence
from
which
a
conviction
could
be
rendered
for
unprotected
conduct.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
most
states
don't
have
any
sort
of
analogous
provision.
the
federal
government
doesn't,
and
it
raises
distinct
problems
from
the
targeting
focus
of
the
law
that's
at
issue
here.
