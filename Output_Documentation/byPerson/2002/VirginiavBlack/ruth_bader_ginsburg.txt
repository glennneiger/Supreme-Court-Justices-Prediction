justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
the
instruction
that
was
given
in
the
black
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
didn't
say
that
they...
it
just
said
the
positive,
that
they
could
make
such
an
inference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this...
in
the
particular
cases
before
us,
what
evidence,
other
than
the
burning
itself,
was
there
to
show
intimidation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
on
your
own
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
quite
a
far--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--about
a
more...
a
more...
case
of
immediate
concern?
you
have
said
that
the
cross...
burning
cross
is
a
symbol
like
no
other.
and
so
this
is
a
self-contained
category.
what
about
other
things
that
are
associated
with
the
klan?
for
example,
the
white
robes
and
the
mask?
are
they
also
symbols
that
the
state
can
ban,
or
is
there
something
about
the
burning
cross
that
makes
it
unique?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i...
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you're
saying
it's
not
unique
then
if
you
could
also
make
going
on
the
highway
in
disguise
a
crime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it...
is
it
a
defense
under
the
statute
for
someone
to
prove
that
they
didn't
intend
to
threaten
anyone,
but
just
purely
to
express
a
viewpoint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how...
how
do
you
look
at
the
statute
in
light
of
the
prima
facie
evidence
provision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
part
of
this
statute
that
we
have
to
look
at,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
the
instruction
given
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
can
infer
the...
the
intent
to
intimidate
just
from
the
act,
even
when
this
is
done
on
one's
own
property,
as
it
was
in
one
of
these
cases,
doesn't
that
go
beyond
the
line,
if...
if
you...
cross-burning
on
your
own
property?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr....
mr.
smolla--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
the
question
of
perfectly
sufficient
laws,
we
have
in
the
appendix
to
the
united
states
brief
several
laws.
they
don't
mention
cross-burnings.
are
all
those
adequate
under
your
test?
would
they
be
constitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
smolla--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there's
a
huge
difference
between
a
flag
and
a
burning
cross,
and
it's
been
pointed
out
in
the
briefs.
the
flag
is
a
symbol
of
our
government,
and
one
of
the
things
about
free
speech
is
we
can
criticize
the
president,
the
supreme
court,
anybody,
and
feel
totally
free
about
doing
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
the
symbol
of
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
cross
is
not
attacking
the
government.
it's
attacking
people,
threatening
their
lives
and
limbs.
and
so
i
don't...
i
think
you
have
to
separate
the
symbol
that
is
the
burning
cross
from
other
symbols
that
are
critical
of
government,
but
that
don't...
that
aren't
a
threat
to
personal
safety.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
mr.
hurd
told
us
that
in
the
brandenburg
case,
where
it
was
just
burned
at
a
rally
as
part
of
the
ceremony,
that's
not
what
this
statute
is
getting
at.
it's
only
when
it's
used
as
a
signal
of
intimidation,
and
that
what
sparked
this
particular
cross-burning
at
this
rally...
this
was
no
ordinary
rally.
this
was
in
response
to
something
that
the
klan
opposed.
