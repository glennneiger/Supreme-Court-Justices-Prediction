mr.
william
h.
hurd
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
virginia
cross-burning
statute
protects
a
very
important
freedom,
freedom
from
fear,
and
it
does
so
without
compromising
freedom
of
speech.
our
statute
does
not
ban
all
cross-burning,
only
cross-burning
used
to
threaten
bodily
harm.
and
unlike
the
ordinance
in
r.a.v.,
our
statute
does
not
play
favorites.
it
bans
cross-burning
as
a
tool
of
intimidation
by
anyone,
against
anyone,
and
for
any
reason.
surely,
for
all
the
reasons
why
we
can
ban
threats
of
bodily
harm,
100
times
over
we
can
ban
this
exceedingly
virulent
weapon
of
fear.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
justice
o'connor,
i
would
like
to
comment
about
that.
there
are
three
major
points
i
would
like
to
make.
first
is
the
inference
is
simply
a
common
sense
rule
of
evidence.
it
says
that
a
burning
cross
may
be
presumed
to
mean
what
we
all
know
it
ordinarily
does
mean,
a
threat
of
bodily
harm.
and
so
it
says
no
more
than
what
a
prosecutor
could
argue
if
the
inference
were
not
there.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
the
jury
is
not
required
to
accept.
it's--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--where
the
inference
is
given,
yes,
your
honor,
it...
it
is
so
instructed,
and
was
so
instructed
in...
in
the
black
case,
though
not
in
the
elliott
case.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
it
appears
in
the
appendix.
the
instruction
is
a
burning
cross--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
instruction
number
9
in
the
joint
appendix.
i
apologize
for
the
delay.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
on
page
146.
the
burning
of
a
cross
by
itself
is
sufficient
evidence
from
which
you
may
infer
the
required
intent.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
it
is
a
purely
permissive
inference.
the
prosecution
retains
the
burden
of
proving
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
an
intent
to
intimidate.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
what
we
had
in
the
case
of...
of
barry
black
was
he
heard
that...
he's
from
pennsylvania,
and
he
heard
that
down
in
carroll
county,
blacks
and
whites
were
holding
hands
on
the
sidewalk.
and
so
they
came
down.
he
came
down,
and
they
had
this
event.
they
chose
a
spot
near
an
open
stretch
of
highway
where
they
erected
a
30-foot
cross.
that's
as
high
as
these
columns.
and
they
burned
it
at
night
with
a
loudspeaker
and
talk
about
taking
a.30/.30
and
randomly
shooting
blacks.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
whether
or
not
there
was
actual
intimidation
of
minorities
who
drove
by
was
not
clearly
established
by
the
record.
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
that
a
black
family
did
drive
by,
pause,
saw
it,
and
took
off
at
a
higher
than
normal
rate
of
speed.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
justice
kennedy--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--brandenburg
was
an
incitement
case,
not...
not
a
threat
case,
although
there
was
a
cross-burning
in
brandenburg--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--no,
your
honor.
there
has
to
be
a...
a
burning
cross.
in
brandenburg--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--well,
we
believe,
your
honor,
that...
that
if
you
read
into
the...
the
threat
jurisprudence
an
immediacy
element,
then...
two
points
i
would
make.
number
one
is
that
you
would...
you
would
constitutionalize
threats
when
someone
said,
i'm
going
to
kill
you,
but
it
won't
be
for
a
little
while.
surely
that
can't
be
the
case.
a
threat,
say,
against
the
president
would
be
constitutional
so
long
as
the...
the
time
when
the
threat
was
going
to
be
delivered
was
delayed.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
the...
the
burning
cross
carries
not
merely
a
message
of
intimidation,
but...
a...
a
threat
of
bodily
harm,
but
a
threat
of
bodily
harm
soon
to
arrive.
now,
the--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--well,
we--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--we
could
have
such
a
statute,
your
honor,
but
the...
the
availability
of
other
options
does
not
mean
the
option
we
have
chosen
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
your
honor,
some...
some
very
well
may.
again--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--respectfully,
that...
that
event
would
not...
would
not
be
the
test
we
believe
established
by
this
court
in
r.a.v.--
moreover,
your
honor,
there's
a...
there's
a
down
side
to
having
a
broad
statute,
and
it
is
this.
that
whenever
you
prohibit
a
proscribable
category
of
speech,
there
will
be
a...
a
zone
of
protected
speech
that
looks
a
lot
like
the
proscribed
category
and
in
which
people
must
be
somewhat
careful
or
they
may
be
arrested
mistakenly,
as
happened
with
mr.
watts
in
the
watts
case.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
it
is--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--justice
scalia,
we...
we
have
statutes
that
prohibit
brandishing
of
firearms.
in
fact,
a...
a
burning
cross
is
very
much
like
a
brandishing
of
a
firearm.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
it
is
virtually...
it
is
virtually
a...
a
present
offer
of
force.
that
makes
it
an
especially
virulent
form
of...
of
intimidation.
let
me,
if
i
may,
come
back
to
justice
o'connor's
point
about
the
inference.
justice
o'connor,
you
asked
whether
the
inference
could
be
struck
down,
severed.
we
believe
the
answer
to
that
question
is...
is
absolutely.
if
this
court
were
to
decide
it
was
problematic,
under
virginia
law,
as
we
cite
in
our
briefs,
it
is...
it
is
severable.
we
have
a
general
severability
statute
in
virginia
so
that
if
the
court
were
not
to
agree
with
us
that
this
inference
is
constitutional,
it
should
not
declare
the
entire
statute
invalid,
but
should
sever
the
inference
and
remand
these
cases
for
further
action.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
your
honor,
it
is
a
criminal
offense
to
burn
a
cross
with
intent
to
intimidate.
now,
what--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--on
your
own
property
if
it
is
a...
a
public
place.
a
public
place
is
defined
in
our
statute...
actually
on
a
jury
instruction...
as
being
not
public
ownership,
but
public
view.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
to...
to--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--to
instill
fear
of...
of
bodily
harm.
the
specificity
of
the
people
is
not
hard
to
figure
out.
it's
whoever
burns
the
cross
is
the
one
who
is
delivering
the
threat.
justice
kennedy,
there...
there
are--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--certainly
the
jury
could,
by
this
instruction,
by
the
burning
cross
infer...
infer
guilt.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
that
would
be
enough
to...
to
get
you
past
a
motion
to
strike.
of
course,
sustaining
a--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--if
the
instruction
were
given,
he
could
be
convicted.
of
course,
in
this
case,
we
have
more
than
a
burning
cross.
and
his...
his
argument,
your
honor--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--he
could
not.
a
burning
circle,
unlike
a
burning
cross,
carries
no
particular
message.
and,
justice
stevens,
i
would...
i
would
point
out
that
where
this
court
has
previously
struck
down
evidentiary
inferences,
it
has
done
so
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
justice
breyer,
absolutely.
there's...
there's...
the
general
assembly
chose
this
word
very
carefully
when
it
said
a
prima
facie
case.
the
state
supreme
court
was
very
careful
when
they
said,
based
on
that
language,
it
would
survive
a
motion
to
strike,
but
there's
no
attempt
in
the
statute
to
preclude
the
kind
of
independent
post-conviction
review
as
required
in
first
amendment
cases.
so
absolutely
in
that
case,
if...
if...
first
of
all,
if
the
police
made
an
arrest,
which
is
doubtful,
and
if
it
was
prosecuted,
which
is
doubtful,
and
if
the
jury
found
guilt,
which
is
doubtful,
then
the
court
could
in
that
case
and
should
in
that
case
vacate
the
conviction.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
the...
the...
that
obviously
was
not
the
only
instruction
given,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
there
was
also
instructions
given
that...
that
required
the
prosecution
to
prove
its
case
beyond
a...
a
reasonable
doubt.
and--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--may,
but...
but
need
not
necessarily.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
well,
the...
the
jury--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--and
justice
scalia,
if
there
were
a
problem
with
that
instruction,
it
would
be
in
our
view
a...
a
due
process
problem,
not
a
first
amendment
problem.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
justice
scalia,
justice
breyer,
in
any
event
that
very
unusual
case
would
present
an
as-applied
challenge.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
justice
ginsburg,
there...
there
are
several
things
about
the
burning
cross
that
make
it
unique.
first,
it
is
the
symbol
that
the
klan
has
used
to...
to
threaten
bodily
harm.
the
connection,
if
you
will,
in
our
history
is...
is
between
the
burning
cross
and
ensuing
violence,
not
so
much
between
people
wearing
white
sheets
and
ensuing
violence.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
and
going
in
disguise
on
the
highway
with
a
particular
intent...
i
believe
there
is.
and
we
have
a
statute
in...
in
virginia.
one
of
the
things...
let
me...
let
me
make
this
point
about
the
burning
cross--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--and
why
it's...
why
it's
unique.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
well,
i
think
going
on
the
highway
in
disguise
is...
is
a
different
kind
of...
of
concern.
it's...
it's
the
same
kind
of
concern
that
might,
in
a
variety
of
cases,
prevent
people
from
disguising
their
identity
from...
from
law
enforcement.
but
in
terms
of...
of
delivering
symbols
and
delivering
threats,
it
really
is
unique.
it
says...
it
says,
we're
close
at
hand.
we
don't
just
talk.
we
act.
and
it
deliberately
invokes
the
precedent
of
87
years
of
cross-burning
as
a
tool
of
intimidation.
burn
anything
else.
burn
the
flag.
burn
a
sheet.
the
message
is
opposition
to
the
thing
that
the
symbol
unburned
represents.
burning
a
cross
is
not
opposition
to
christianity.
the
message
is
a
threat
of
bodily
harm,
and
it...
it
is
unique.
and
it's
not
simply
a
message
of
bigotry.
it's
a
message
that...
that
whoever
has
it
in
their
hands,
a
message
of
bodily
harm
is
coming.
that
is
the
primary
message--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--obnoxious.
justice
stevens,
we
have
a
lot
of
obnoxious
speech,
and
it's
all
perfectly
fine.
this
is
not
obnoxious
speech.
this
is
a...
a
threat
of
bodily
harm.
justice
souter
made
the
point
in
the
concurrence
in...
in
hill
v.
colorado
the
government
may
punish
certain
types
of
expressive
conduct
even
though
that
conduct
is
associated
with
a
particular
point
of
view.
those
who
burn
draft
cards
typically
oppose
the
draft.
those
who
engage
in
sidewalk
counseling
typically
oppose
abortion.
but
we
can
oppose
restrictions
on
those
activities.
similarly,
we
can
ban
cross
burning
as
a
tool
of
intimidation
even
though
many
people
who
practice
cross-burning
may
also
carry
with
that
cross-burning
some
message
of
bigotry.
but
the
primary
message...
the
fundamental
message
is
a
threat
of
bodily
harm.
and
this
is
not
something
that
we
just
made
up.
cross-burning
has
that
message
because
for
decades
the
klan
wanted
it
to
have
that
message
because
they
wanted
that
tool
of
intimidation.
and
so
it
rings
a
little
hollow
when
the
klan
comes
to
court
and
complains
that
our
law
treats
that
message...
treats
that
burning
cross
as
having
exactly
the
message
that
they
for
decades
have
wanted
it
to
have.
and
so,
we
do
believe
that
our
statute
is...
is
quite
constitutional.
they
may
have
a
political
rally
with
a
burning
cross,
but
what
they
cannot
do
is
use
a
klan
ceremony
as
a
way
to
smuggle
through
real
threats
of
bodily
harm
with
a
specific
intent
to
intimidate.
that
is
what
happened
in
the
barry
black
case,
as
the
jury
found.
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
that
case
has...
has
not
been
contested.
for
these
reasons,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
below
and,
justice
stevens,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
very
briefly.
justice
souter,
the
tie-breaker
is
the
intent
to
intimidate
which
is
in
our
statute.
if
there's
no
intent
to
intimidate,
there's
no
violation
here.
opposing
counsel's
problem
is
how
does
the
klan
go
out
in
public
and
burn
a
cross
and
have
it
viewed
not
as
its
common,
ordinary
meaning
backed
up
by
100
years
of
history.
well,
one
thing
they
could
do
is
not
talk
about
shooting
blacks
with
a.30/.30.
that
might
suggest
there's
no
intent
to
intimidate.
opposing
counsel
suggests
that
there
should
be
a
broader
law.
well,
congress
could
pass
a
broader
law,
one
that
didn't
focus
on
threats
against
the
president,
one
that
focused
on
threats
against
any
federal
employee,
but
this
court
has
said
a
broader
law
is
not
needed
because
threats
against
the
president
are
especially
problematic.
so
is
cross-burning.
it
is
not
just
hate
speech.
it
doesn't
just
say
i
don't
like
you
because
you
are
black.
in
the
hands
of
the
klan,
the
message
is
the
law
cannot
help
you
if
you're
black
or
catholic
or
jewish
or
foreign-born,
or
we
just
don't
like
you,
and
if
you
try
to
live
your
life
as
a
free
american,
we
are
going
to
kill
you.
that
is
the
message
of
cross-burning
backed
up
by
100
years
of
history.
that's
why
it
is
especially
virulent.
and
that's
why
under
r.a.v.,
this
court
can
allow
us
to
proscribe
it
without
having
to
pass
any
other
law,
or
pretend
it
is
the
same
as
something
quite
different
than
what
it
is.
we
have
not
interfered
with
freedom
of
speech.
we
have
not
tried
to
suppress
any
idea.
all
we
have
tried
to
do
is
to
protect
freedom
from
fear
for
all
of
our
citizens
by
guarding
against
this
especially
virulent
form
of
intimidation.
we
ask
that
the
decision
below
be
reversed
and
the
statute
upheld.
thank
you.
