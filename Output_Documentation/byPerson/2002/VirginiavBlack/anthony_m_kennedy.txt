justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
the
jury
is
instructed
accordingly
by
the
judge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
is
the
jury
so
instructed
by
the
judge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
was
that...
did
that
intimidate
everyone
who
drove
by
in
their
passenger
vehicle
or...
let's
put
it
this
way...
racial
minorities
who
drove
by
in
their
passenger
vehicle?
all
of
those
were
intimidated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
surely
they
were
in
no
fear
of
immediate
violence,
and
our...
our
brandenburg
line
of
cases
says
there
must
be
an
element
of
immediacy--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--before
you
can
punish
speech
by
reason
of
its
content.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
if
i...
if
i
have
a
picture
of
a
burning
cross,
and
i...
and
i
gave
it
to
somebody,
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--isn't
that
because
there's
an
immediacy
element
to
the
threat?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that...
that
may
be...
that
may
be
a
different...
so...
so
in
your
view
if
a
burning
cross
is
just
put
on
a
hill
outside
of
the
city,
everybody
in
the
city
can
be
deemed
intimidated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
doesn't
virginia
just
have
a
statute
making
it
a
crime
to
threaten
bodily
harm
that's
soon
to
arrive--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--burning
cross
or
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
other
states
have
criminal
statutes
that
have
the
broad-based
intimidation
prohibition
that
i've
just
described?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
not
found
one.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
to
make
it
clear,
anytime
in
virginia
a
burning
cross
is
put
near
a
highway,
that
is
an...
a
criminal
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
not
on
your
own--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
intimidate
means
to
cause
fear
of
violence
at
some
unspecified
time
in
the
future--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--from
some
unspecified
people.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was...
was
there
a
common
law
of
intimidation,
a
tort...
a
tort
that
went
beyond
assault?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there...
is
there
an
immediacy
component
to
that
as
there
is
with
assaults?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
were...
you
were
saying
that
the
state
can
go...
doesn't
have
to
have
a
sterile
law
on
intimidation.
it
can
go
further,
but
not
as
far
as
this.
what--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
is
this
midpoint?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
was
in
conjunction
with
an
actual
physical
assault.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose...
suppose
if
you
threaten
by
use
of
a
cross...
burning
cross,
would
that
be
a
specific
statutory
category
that
allows
the
penalty
be...
to
be
enhanced?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
can
you
have
a
statutory
category
which
enhances
the
penalty
that
you
can't
also
use
to...
to
describe
the
underlying
offense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that...
that
seems
to
give
them
a
free
ride
when
they
really
want
to
intimidate
and...
and
threaten.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
isn't...
why
can't
we
say
there's
no
three...
free
ride
when
the
government
imposes
scienter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
100
years...
100
years
of
history.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--exactly,
justice
kennedy,
that's
the
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
if
the
other
group
all
are
brandishing
guns
as
justice
scalia
said?
