justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
argument
would
be
the
same
even
if
we
assumed
that
the
capacity
of
the
cross
to
convey
this
message
was
limited
to
certain
groups,
blacks,
catholics,
or
whatnot.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is...
isn't
the...
isn't
your
argument
an
argument
that
would
have
been
sound
before
the
cross,
in
effect,
acquired
the
history
that
it
has?
if
we
were
in
the
year
1820,
and
you
had
a
choice
between
somebody
brandishing
the
loaded
gun,
and
somebody
brandishing
a
cross
and
nobody
knew
how
the
cross
had
been
used
because
it
had
not
been
used,
your
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
would
be...
would
be
a
winning
one.
how
does
your
argument
account
for
that
fact
that
the
cross
has
acquired
a
potency
which
i
would
suppose
is
at
least
as
equal
to
that
of
the
gun?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it...
it
carries
something
else,
doesn't
it?
isn't
it
not
merely
a...
a
trademark
that
has
acquired
a
meaning?
isn't
it
also
a
kind
of
pavlovian
signal
so
that
when
that
signal
is
given,
the
natural
human
response
is
not
recognition
of
a
message,
but
fear?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
don't
make...
they
don't
make
you
scared,
and
if
you
start...
for
your
own
safety.
and
if
you
start
with
the
proposition
that
state
can,
in
fact,
prevent
threats
that
scare
people
reasonably...
for
their
own
safety,
this
is
in
a
separate
category
from
simply
a...
a
symbol
that
has
acquired
a
potent
meaning.
i
dare
say--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
about
a
cross...
how
about
a
cross--
justice
david
h.
souter
--how
about
a
cross
on
your
lawn?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
we'll...
we'll
accept...
i
mean,
i
think
we
accept
that,
but
we...
our
problem
is
that
the
100
years
have
also
added
something
else,
and
that
is
the
kind
of
specific
pavlovian
quality
that
i
spoke
of.
and
if
that
is
giving
us
difficulty
in
deciding
whether
we
should
classify
this
in
the
o'brien
direction,
or
the
flag
direction,
what's
the...
what's
the...
in
effect,
the
tie-breaker?
