justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
virginia
against
black.
mr.
hurd,
please,
you
may
proceed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on...
about
instruction
9
to
which
you
called
our
attention?
it
says,
the
court
instructs
the
jury
that
the
burning
of
a
cross
by
itself
is
sufficient
evidence
from
which
you
may
infer
the
required
intent.
does
that
mean
it
is
sufficient
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by
which
you
can
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
in...
in
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
cross
burned
out
in
the
middle
of
a
desert
somewhere,
and
that's
all
that's
proved,
that
would
be
enough
to
sustain
the
conviction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
say
there's
no...
the
defendant
puts
in
no
evidence,
just
rests
on
the...
on...
on
just
remains
mute.
he
could
be
convicted
on
it
in
that
case,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
but
then
my
next
question
is...
i'm
asking
about
whether
there's
content
discrimination.
supposing
he
burned
a...
a
circle,
he
could
not
be
convicted
on
the
same
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
defending
the
statute
on
the
ground
that
the
message
that
this
particular
act
conveys
is
particularly
obnoxious.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
hurd.
mr.
dreeben.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
from
this
argument,
if
the
message
is
as
powerful
as
justice
thomas
suggests
it
is...
and
i'm
sure
he's...
he's
right
about
that...
why
is
it
necessary
to
go
beyond
the
message
itself?
why...
why
wouldn't
it
still
be
proscribable
even
if
the
person
burning
it
didn't
realize
all
of
this
history,
just
did
it
innocently,
but
it
nevertheless
had
that
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
need
the
intent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
my
assumption
is
that
the
geographic
scope
of
the
statute
is
just
like
this
statute.
it
doesn't
apply
to
your
own
property,
but
on
anyone
else's
property,
or
in
public
view.
if
the
message
is
as
powerful
as...
as
we're
assuming
as
it
is,
why
isn't
that
a
sufficient
basis
for
just
banning
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
smolla,
we'll...
we'll
hear
from
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
supposing
you
have
a
statute
that
prohibits
intimidation
by
burning
circles,
any...
any
design
of
any
kind,
and
the
maximum
penalty
is
a
year
in
jail,
but
if
you
burn
a
cross,
it's
2
years
in
jail.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
it's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
it's
content-based
discrimination
within
the
category
of
activity
that
can
be
entirely
proscribed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
is
there
any
support
for
that
proposition
other
than
the
majority
opinion
in
r.a.v.?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smolla,
i
would...
i
would
like
to
take
exception
to
your
suggestion
in
response
to
justice
breyer
that
the
words,
i
will
kill
you,
always
have
a
threatening
meaning.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
they're
often
used
in
casual
conversation
without
any
such
threatening
meaning
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smolla,
i
thought
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
smolla.
mr.
hurd,
you
have
2
minutes
in
which
to
discuss
all
these
hypotheticals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
hurd.
the
case
is
submitted.
