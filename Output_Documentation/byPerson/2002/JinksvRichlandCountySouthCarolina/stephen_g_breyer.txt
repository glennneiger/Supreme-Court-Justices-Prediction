justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
a
political
subdivision
or
not?
suppose
south
carolina
law
said,
gas
stations
shall
be
immune
from
suit
except
that
you
can
sue
them
within
two
years,
and
then
the
same
situation
occurs.
would...
would
not
the
federal
court
be
intruding
upon
south
carolina's
decision
of
immunity
just
as
much?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's...
and
that's
all
we're
talking
about,
to
set
a
statute
of
limitations
whether
it's
for
private
defendants
or
whether
it's
for
richland
county
which,
as
far
as
federal
law
is
concerned,
is
a
private
defendant,
or
whether
it's
for
gas
stations.
i
mean,
i...
you...
you
try
to
make
something
different
of
this
case
by
saying
what
it
involves
in...
is
richland
county,
but
what
we,
the
federal
courts,
say
is
richland
county
is
not
the
state
of
south
carolina.
it
is
not
a
state
entity,
and
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
it's
a
gas
station.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
give
greater
defenses
for
gas
stations.
would...
would
that
change
the
gas
station
case
simply
because
you
give
greater
defenses
to
gas
stations?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
is,
of
course,
they
could
if
they
had
a...
if
there
was
a
basis
in
the
constitution
for
the
federal
government
to
pass
a
law
that
changes
state
law.
they
do
it
every
day
of
the
week.
and
so
usually
what
you
ask
is,
is
there
a
basis
here?
of
course,
there
is.
they
say
article
iii.
indeed,
was
there
a
problem
congress
was
trying
to
cure?
indeed,
there
is.
it
was
the
mess
that
existed
before
the
statute.
is
there
an
infringement
of
what
the
state
would
like
to
do?
of
course,
there
is
but
the
constitution
gives
the
power
to
the
federal
government
to
do
that.
now...
now,
what's...
that...
like,
you
know,
purely
i'd
say
hornbook.
so
what...
what
is
the...
what
is
the
special
thing
about
this
infringement
of
the
state's
power
to
do
what
it
would
like
to
do
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
congress
in
your
opinion
doesn't
have
the
power
to...
to
interfere
with
state
law
insofar
as
it
creates
state
laws
of
action?
congress
couldn't
pass
tort
reform,
for
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
except
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
relief
act,
for
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
it
wasn't
necessary
to
litigants.
it's
just
that
your
solution
to
the
problem
permits
the
two
parties
who
want
to
try
their
case
in
federal
court
to
confer
a
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
court
that
the
district
judge
believes
it
doesn't
have
and
doesn't
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
from
a
point
of
view
of
protecting
the
state,
i
guess
congress
dived
into
this
mess.
i...
i
wrote
an
opinion.
you
might...
to
recall
it
to
mind,
it
happened
to
involve
a
plagiarism.
did
you
read...
i
had
a
1st
circuit
case.
it
involved
plagiarism
of
an
icelandic
poet
called
franjen
gendulik.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
that...
you're
not
aware
of
that.
well,
if
you
don't...
that
doesn't
call
it
to
mind--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
poem
was
suze
sine
razmut
nogot.
in
any
case,
the...
the
point
was
at
the
end
of
that
it
seemed
like
a
terrible
mess.
there
seemed
like
five
solutions.
each
of
them
had
something
to
be
said
for
it,
and
so
congress
went
in
to
legislate
in
order
to
deal
with
this
procedural
mess.
now...
now,
why
isn't
that
a
legitimate
interest
just
as
legitimate
as
the
interest
in
protecting
soldiers
and
sailors,
the
interest
that
underlies
lots
of
other
federal
legislation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
deal
with
a
problem
of
unfairness
to
states,
unfairness
to
litigants,
try
to
have
a
uniform
rule?
