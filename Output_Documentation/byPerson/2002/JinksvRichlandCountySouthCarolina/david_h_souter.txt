justice
david
h.
souter
we...
we
know
what
congress
has...
has...
has
defined.
why
is
it
important?
i
mean,
what
is
the...
how
would
you
define
the
important
interest
to
the
federal
courts
in...
in
our
seeing
the
constitutional
issue
your
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
state
says,
we
don't
want
this
kind
of
comity.
keep
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i...
i
want
to
get
down
to
specifically
what's
important
to
the
federal
courts
and
to
congress.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
would
it
hurt
the
federal
courts
if
you
lose
this
case?
what's...
practically
what's...
what's
at
stake?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
how
is
that
going
to
hurt
the
federal
courts?
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
isn't
the
person
to
be
concerned
for
those
litigants
the
state
courts
under
whose
law
the
litigants
want
to
sue?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
why
isn't
the
answer
then
necessarily
the
same
whether
we
have
a
private
litigant
or
whether
we
have
a...
a
political
subdivision?
they
said
for
the
private
litigants,
two
year
statute
of
limitations.
why
isn't
your
answer
exactly
the
same?
the
state
was
exercising
the
state's...
the
same
sovereign
power
in
each
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
i...
i
hadn't
understood
that
was
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
don't...
you
don't
need
it.
you
don't
need
it.
the
private
litigant
doesn't
have
any
sovereign
immunity
rights
under
state
law,
but
the
private
litigant
would
be
able
to
insist
on
the
two-year
statute
just
the
way
the
county
is
insisting
on
it
here.
