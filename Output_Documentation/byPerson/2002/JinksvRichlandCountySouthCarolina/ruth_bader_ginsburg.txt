justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
understand
it
that
way,
but
south
carolina
said,
federal
court,
you
want
to
take
this
and
deal
with
this
stale
claim?
that's
all
right
with
us.
it's
one
of
the
ironies
of
the
case
that
the
state's
position
is
the
federal
court
can
have
it
if
you
keep
it.
the
only
thing
they
can't
do
is
give
it
back
to
us
when
we
don't
want
it
because
that
would
be
commandeering
the
use
of
our
courts.
south
carolina's
position
is
the
federal
court
can
keep
our
state
claim
in
federal
court.
indeed,
it
must
if
it
wants
the
claim
to
remain
alive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
difference
does
complexity
make
if
the
state
federal
court's
position
is
we
don't
want
to
clutter
up
federal
courts
with
a
lot
of
state
tort...
garden
variety,
simple
state
tort
claims?
we
don't
want
to
be
a
fender
bender
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
the
idea
is
that
federal
courts
should
be
occupied
with
federal
cases
and
not
with
state
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
agreed
that
as
far
as
the
federal
courts
are
concerned,
this
is
all
fine.
so
it
was
necessary
to
spare
the
federal
courts
having
to
sit
on
a
case
that
no
longer
has
a
federal
element.
that's
fine.
it
serves
a
legitimate
federal
purpose.
but,
says
south
carolina,
you
can't...
it
isn't
proper
to
tell
us
then...
they
can
dump
it.
they
can't
tell
us
that
we
have
to
pick
it
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
a...
that
was
a
civil
war
tolling
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well...
well,
isn't
it...
if...
suppose
you
should
not
prevail
here.
well,
then
you
just
bring...
the
plaintiff
would
bring
two
actions,
bring...
bring
a
protective
action
in
the
state
court
within
the
statute
of
limitations
and
then
that
would
solve
the
problem,
wouldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
lindemann,
one
of
the
curiosities
about
this
case
is
if
the
federal
court,
once
the
federal
claim
dropped
out,
decided
that
it
would
clean...
clean
up
the
operation,
it
would
keep
it
in
federal
court,
there
would
be
a
federal
court
adjudicating
south
carolina's
state
law
case.
the
only
regulating
rules
would
be
state
rules.
and
south
carolina
says,
that's
okay
with
us.
they
can
take
our
law
into
the
federal
court
and
apply
it
there
and...
but
we
don't
want
it
back.
in
other
words,
we
want
to
force
our
cases
to
be
litigated
into...
in
the
federal
court.
and
that
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
you're
saying
it's
all
right
with
us
if
the
federal
court
adjudicates
this
purely
state
claim.
the
state
isn't
offended
by
that,
but
it
is
offended
by
getting
it
back
even
though
everyone
had
notice
in
ample
time
within
the...
the
county
had
ample
notice
because
they
received
a
federal
summons
and
complaint.
so
there
was
no
question
of...
of
repose
involved.
but
there's
one...
another
aspect
of
this,
it
seems
to
me,
passing
strange.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
removal
statute
would
be
vulnerable
to
a
similar
attack?
because
that's
really...
if
you're
talking
about
state
court,
this
is
wrenching
a
case
out
of
the
state
court,
ousting
the
state
court
of
jurisdiction,
putting
it
into
the
federal
court.
i
would
think
if
you're
right
about
sending
it
back,
then
you'd
certainly
object
to
lifting
it
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
have
no--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
went
back
to
the
old
ways,
is
there
any
unconstitutionality
in
one
of
the
things
that
was
done?
and
the
federal
judge
will
say,
yeah,
this
is
really
state
business,
but
i'm
not
going
to
subject
the
plaintiff
to
a
time
bar.
so,
defendant,
richland
county,
any
defendant,
will
you
agree
that
you
will
waive
the
statute
of
limitations
should
i
dismiss
this
case
without
prejudice.
the...
the...
the
state...
the
county
certainly
could
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
about
bringing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
plaintiff
brings
a
protective
action
and
says,
i
really
want
this
1983
claim
to
be
the
front
runner,
but
if
i
fail
on
that,
i
want
to
have
these
garden
variety
state...
whatever
it
is...
assault
cases.
so
the
plaintiff
begins
a
state...
a
case
in
state
court
and
the
state
tort
claims,
the
federal
case,
including
the
1983
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
that
would
be
perfectly
all
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
all
that
accomplishes
is
having
two
cases
instead
of
one,
which
is
if...
if
that
can
be
avoided,
it's...
for
the
efficiency
of
the
system,
it's
a
pretty
good
idea,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
1367(d)
was
meant
to
overcome
i
thought,
having
two
lawsuits
going
on,
just
to
have
the...
the
state
court
sitting
there
and
nothing
happening
in
the
event
that
the
federal
court
should
dismiss
the
federal
claim
and
there's
a
live
lawsuit
to
pick
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that...
was
that
a...
an
immunity--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--official...
an
officer
immunity
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
difference
is
that
the
state
is
not
amenable
to
suit
in
federal
court.
the
municipality
is
just
like
any
other
corporation.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it's
not
a
kind
of
jurisdictional
challenge.
i
mean,
the
state...
if
the
state
were
sued
in
federal
court
and
there
was
a
pending
claim,
the
state
would
say
you...
we
don't
fit
under
1367(a),
and
the
state
is
not
there
at
all.
but
here
this
claim
is
properly
brought
in
federal
court
against
the
city.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
very
large
difference
in
that
respect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
can
see
in
the
abstract
what
your
argument
is,
but
in
the
concrete,
let's
take
the
removal
case.
so
there's
a
case
lodged
in
state
court.
it's
lifted
up,
put
into
federal
court,
and
then
more
than
2
years
later,
it
gets
remanded.
practically
what's
the
difference
in
terms
of
south
carolina
and
its
concern
with
stale
claims
between
those
two
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
functionally
i
don't
see
any
significant
difference
if
the
concern
is
we
don't
want
stale
claims.
we
don't
want
to
adjudicate
claims
that
have
been
hanging
around
more
than
two
years.
in
my
case,
yes,
you
touched
base
in
federal...
in
state
court.
what
you
got
was
what
you
got
in
federal
court,
that
is,
notice
that
the
plaintiff
is
suing
arising
out
of
this
particular
episode.
i
don't
see
practically
any
difference
if
the
state's...
the
state
is
trying
to
protect
its
concern
for
adjudicating
stale
claims.
the
claim
is
still
stale
when
it
comes
back
from
the
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
a
judge
should
say...
the
federal
judge...
knowing
south
carolina's
position
on
this
question,
i'll
keep
the
case,
which
is
now
an
entirely
state
case,
and
i
know
that
in
diversity
cases
i'm
supposed
to
apply
the
state
statute
of
limitations.
so
if
the
federal
judge
keeps
this
case
in
deference
to
south
carolina's
position
that
it
doesn't
want
it,
it's
too
late,
and
the
federal
court
in
a
diversity
case
must
apply
the
state
statute
of
limitations,
when...
when
does
that
limitation
begin,
when
south
carolina
said
it
would
if
the
case
were
reinstituted
there?
