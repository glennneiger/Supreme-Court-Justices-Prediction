justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
anti-injunction
act
just
applies
to
federal
courts,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
comity
is
traditionally
a
matter
of
consent
rather
than
having
one
sovereign
impress
its...
its
law
on
the
other.
i
mean,
it's
consensual.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they're
asking
the
south
carolina
courts
to
grant
relief
in
a
case
that
is
outside
the
statute
of
limitations.
i
take
it
they
don't...
the
south
carolina
courts
don't
normally
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
this
case
come
out
differently
in
the
state?
supposing
georgia,
a
neighboring
state,
had
no
such
waiver.
would
this
case
come
out
differently
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not...
is
it
not
correct...
is
it
not
correct
that
the
intrusion
on
state
sovereignty...
forget
the
federal
side
of
the
balance
for
a
moment...
the
intrusion
on
state
sovereignty
is
precisely
the
same
under
all
these
other
statutes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
the
intrusion
in
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act
any
different
than
this
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
about
the
bankruptcy
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
neither
does
this
statute
change
the
liability.
it
just
preserves
the
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
like
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
it
be
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity
if
a
sailor
had...
had
sued
them
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm...
i'm
just
looking
at
it
from
the
state's
point
of
view
in
the
point
of
my
questions.
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
the
state
interest
in
it
being
immune
was
any
different
in
any
of
those
situations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't...
isn't
one
of
the
questions
who
should
do
the
balancing?
should
we
do
it
or
should
congress
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
congress
normally
make
this
kind
of
policy
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
branch
of
the
federal
government
that
makes
this
kind
of
policy
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
assume
the
state
of
south
carolina
was
represented
in
congress
at
the
time
they
made
that
decision
and
could
be...
could
raise
all
these
objections
in
that
forum.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
eleventh
amendment
was
really
implicated
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
think
the
clear
statement
rule
is
limited
to
states,
and
of
course,
counties
are
not
considered
the
same
as
states.
