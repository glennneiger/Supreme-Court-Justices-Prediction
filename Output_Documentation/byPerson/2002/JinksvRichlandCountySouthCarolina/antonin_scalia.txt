justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lindemann,
i
don't...
i
don't
see
what
difference
it
makes
that
the
statute
of
limitations
in
this
case
was
applied
to...
to
what
you
call
state
sovereign
immunity.
that
is,
you...
you
acknowledge
that
this
entity,
richmond...
richland
county,
was...
was
not
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity
as
we
know
it
under
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
that
the
state
wished
to
confer
upon
richland
county
a
shorter
statute
of
limitations
for
suit
against
it
than...
than
this
federal
statute
permits.
why
is
that
any...
any
different
from
applying
the
same
statute
against
south
carolina's
determination
that
a
private
individual
should
not
be
suable
after
2
years?
what
difference
does
it
make
whether...
whether
the
person
being
affected
by
it
is
a
private
individual
or
richland
county?
so
long
as
it's
not
the
state
of
south
carolina,
federal
sovereign
immunity
law
is
not...
is
not
at
issue.
what
do
we
care?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
was
made
into
a
movie,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
i
just
don't
understand
why
you
think
we
should...
we
should
care.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're
not
talking
about
federal
sovereign
immunity
of
the
state,
why
should
we
care
if...
if
the
state
chooses
to
create
some
other
kind
of
sovereign
immunity
that...
that
isn't
the
kind
that
we're
concerned
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
doesn't.
the...
the
essence
of
state
sovereignty
is
everything
covered
by
federal
state
sovereign
immunity
which
is
states
and
agencies
of
states.
everything
else
is
not
central
to
state
sovereignty,
whether...
whether
they
choose
to
make
richland
county
a...
you
know,
give
them
some
state
sovereignty
protection
or...
or
choose
to
make
a
gas
station
that
way.
i
don't...
i
just
don't
understand
why
you
expect
this
to
impress
us,
that
the
state
has
gone
beyond
federal
state
sovereign
immunity
and
created
some
new
element
of
state
sovereign
immunity.
i
mean,
they're...
they're
free
to
do
that,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
invokes
any
new
doctrine
under
either
the
eleventh
amendment
or
the
tenth
amendment
or
any
other
provision
of
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
and
remand
for
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
the
court's
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
