mr.
robert
s.
peck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
enacting
section
1367,
congress
took
up
this
court's
invitation
in
finley
to
manage
the
boundaries
of
supplemental
jurisdiction.
it
had
two
goals
in
doing
so.
it
sought
to
provide
a
federal
forum
for
the
plaintiffs
that
so
chose
to
use
it,
and
for...
for
reasons
of
respect
for
the
interests
of
comity
and
federalism,
it
provided
a
mechanism
by
which
those
cases
may
be
returned
to
state
court.
they
knew
that
there
was
a
dilemma,
a
dilemma
caused
by
the
operation
of
statutes
of
limitations,
and
so
they
sought
to
find
and
found
a
simple,
practical,
workable
solution
that
traveled
down
a
well-trod
path.
it's
a
path
that
was
traveled
down
by
the
soldier
and
sailors'
relief
act,
a
act
that
also
tolls
state
statutes
of
limitations
even
when
exigent
circumstances
do
not
exist.
and
in
the
case
in
1993
holding
that,
conroy,
this
court
found
that
it
was
applicable
in
that
instance
to
a
defendant
who
was
a
town.
it
also
traveled
down
that
road
in
section
108
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
this
too
provides
that
kind
of
30-day
window
after
dismissal
of
the
automatic
stay
or
lifting
of
the
automatic
stay
for
a
plaintiff
to
file
an
action
which
is
otherwise
purely
a
state
matter
in
state
court.
this
court
found
in
stewart
v.
kahn
that
there
is
no
federalism
bar
to
congressional
authority
as
long
as
that
authority
exists
someplace
in
the
constitution.
throughout
its
history,
pursuant
to
article
i,
which
has
a
cognate
provision
duplicative
of
the
authority
it
derives
also
from
article
iii,
congress
has
used
its
jurisdiction-setting
authority
as
a
traffic
cop
over
the
area
of
concurrent
state
and
federal
jurisdiction.
it
has
done
so
almost
from
the
beginning
in
the
anti-injunction
act,
the
removal
statute,
and
has
always
found
this
to
be
a
necessary
incident
of
maintaining
a
dual-court
system.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
the...
it
gives
federal
courts
the
authority,
though,
to
stay
a
state
action
when
it
interferes
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
that's
an
exception
contained
in
the
anti-injunction
act,
and
another
exception
is
when
an
act
of
congress
so
provides.
the
choice
of
tolling
did
not
attempt
to
give
longer
life
in
state
court
than
it
would
have
enjoyed
in
federal
court.
it
did
not
eliminate
defenses
that
were
available
in
federal
court,
have
the
matter
remain
there.
it
did
not
change
the
state's
policy
on
waiver
of
municipal
liability
or
alter
its
statute
of
limitations.
it
simply
said
that
the
case,
as
it
stood
in
federal
court,
is
now
available
to
be
heard
in
state
court.
the
state
is
free
to
change
both
its
waiver
of
immunity,
its
statute
of
limitations,
and
congress
accepts
those
changes
regardless
of
the
application
of
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute.
once
that
jurisdiction
attaches,
once
the
federal
court
has
authority
to
hear
the
state
action,
then
even
after
the
federal...
federal
claim
has
fallen
away,
the
court
still
has
the
jurisdiction
to
hear
what
otherwise
would
have
been
a
purely
state
claim.
this
is
unusual
in
a
diversity
case.
when
complete
diversity
is
broken,
the
jurisdiction
ends.
but
here
no
one,
not
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina,
not
the
respondents,
not
the
amici,
questioned
congress'
authority
to
say
that
this
remains
a
federal
matter
because
a
federal
interest
has
attached
because
the
matter
has
now
been
heard.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
that...
that
is
correct,
and
even
at
this
late
date,
rule
60(b)
would
enable
a
plaintiff
like
susan
jinks
to
seek
to
reopen
that
federal
case,
to...
to
reconsider
its
judgment
and
allow
this
case
to
still
live
if...
if
the
tolling
provision
is
ineffective.
so
here
what
we're
saying
is
that
there's
a
continuing
federal
interest
in
this
matter.
there's...
there's
been
a
federal
attachment
to
what
otherwise
would
have
been
a
purely
state
matter.
in
a
removal
situation,
for
example,
south
carolina
could
not
refuse
a
remand
and
we
contend
that
that
authority
which
is
contained
in
the
removal
statute
is
the
same
kind
of
authority
that
congress
is
exercising
here
because
what
congress
has
effectively
done
is
define
the
legal
effect
of
the
appearance
of
this
matter
in
federal
court
and
the
federal
disposition
of
it.
and
the
state
courts
of
south
carolina
or
any
other
state
is
not
equipped,
it's
not
authorized
to
refuse
that
definition
because
congress
is
the
supreme
sovereign
of
federal
law.
so--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--well,
first
of
all,
congress
wanted
to
provide
this
federal
forum.
they
clearly
had
the
authority
to
do
that.
but
they
also
wanted
to
take
in
the
interest
of
comity
which
this
court
has
always
referred
to
as
a
vital
consideration.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
it's...
it's
very
nice
for
the
state
to
have
that
interest,
but
the
federalist
design
of
our
constitution
provides
that
impetus
that
congress
was
acting
on.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
well--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--i...
i
think
there
are...
there
are
several
things
that
might
happen.
right
now
what
we
call
supplemental
jurisdiction
is
a
doctrine
of
discretion.
it
would
be
turned
into
a
doctrine
of
plaintiffs'
rights,
that
if
the
state
courts
are
refusing
to
receive
these
case...
cases,
then
the
federal
courts
will
be
obligated
to
hear
these
state
matters
even
if
they
were
novel
and
complex
matters
in
which
only
the
state
courts
have
the
appropriate
expertise
to
hear
it.
and
i
think
that
would
cause
some
problems.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
and
i
think
it
is
perfectly
legitimate
in
congress'
jurisdiction-setting
authority
for
them
to
make
that
determination.
these
are
matters
that
are--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--and
i...
i
think
that
is
an
appropriate...
appropriate
reason
for
congress
to
adopt
this
kind
of
a
statute
to
assure
that
that
happens.
the
other...
justice
souter,
the
other
possible
consequence
is
that
plaintiffs,
fearful
that
a
federal
court
will
not
hear
their
matter,
will
not
take
it
back
if
the...
the
state
courts
will
not
accept
the
matter,
may
be
left
without
a
cause
of
action
on
their
state
claim,
that
they
will
suddenly
be
shut
out
the
door.
and
in
order
to--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--that
does
not
necessarily
hurt
the
federal
courts,
but
congress
certainly
has
a
right
to
be
concerned
for
those
litigants
and
try
to--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--because...
because,
justice
souter,
here
the
state
courts
have...
have...
congress
has
basically
done
one
thing.
they've...
they've
looked
at
the
idea
of
comity
that
this
court
had
talked
about
in
guaranty
trust,
in
ragan,
and...
and
what
they
said
is
that
comity
is
a
reciprocal
process.
it's
got
to
have
a
two-way
street.
and
so
what
we're
doing
is
we're
not
giving
longer
life
in
federal
court
to
what's
in
state
court.
we
have
the
authority
to
assign
to
the
state
courts
a
matter
that
is
purely
federal
in
nature.
now
we
have
a
matter
that
has
a
federal
interest
because
of
the
intervention
of
its
arrival
in
federal
court,
and
because
of
that,
we
have
enough
authority
also
to
say
that
this
is
a
matter
that
the
state
courts
can't
refuse.
they
can't
suddenly
say
that
we
do
not
recognize
the
authority
here--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--it
is
consensual,
but
then
again,
the...
the
idea
behind
comity
is
tied
up
with
our...
our
federalism
and
our
idea
that
we
have
a
dual
court
system.
that
dual
court
system
recognizes
that
there
will
be
conflicts.
there
will
be
some...
some
difficulties
between
the
federal
and
state
systems.
those
difficulties
is
what
congress
is
trying
to
police.
it's
a...
it's
a
function
that
they
have
performed
repeatedly,
and
the
removal
statute
is
a
very
good
example
of
that.
and
certainly
congress
could
insist...
could
insist
that
the
state
courts
receive
back
even
a
matter
that
the
federal
court
erroneously
dismissed
rather
than
remand
it.
and
here
they're
not
asking
the
south
carolina
courts
to
do
anything
that
they
don't
normally
do.
if
a...
a
matter
is--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--south
carolina
courts,
as...
as
we
cited
in
the...
the
hilton
head
and
moriarty
decisions,
has
said
that
they
will
sometimes
waive
the
statute
of
limitations
in
the
interest
of
justice.
another
instance
in
which
they
waive
that
issue
is
when
venue
has
been
misapplied.
when...
when
they
demand
that
venue
be
placed
in
one
particular
place,
you
file
in
that
wrong
place,
the
statute
of
limitations
expires
before
that
court
acts
on
it,
they
say
it
has
jurisdiction
to
transfer
it
to
the
proper
venue.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
don't
think
so,
and
the
reason
i
don't
think
so
is
because
when
all
that
is
left
in
the
federal
court
is
a
matter
that
is
otherwise
a
state-based
claim,
that
federal
court
sits
as
just
another
court
of
that
jurisdiction,
another
court
within
that
state's
system.
and
for
that
reason...
for
that
reason,
it
ought
to
be
treated,
when
congress
so
authorizes...
and
congress,
exercising
that
article
iii,
that
necessary
and
proper
powers
that
it
had,
utilizing
the
supremacy
clause,
authorizes
that
this
be
treated
essentially
by
tolling
as
meeting
the
statute
of
limitations.
they
have
the
right
to
define
the
meaning
of
what
the
federal
law
is
here,
and
that
is
simply
what
they've
done.
they've
done
it
by
adopting
a
tolling
provision
that
is
not
unlike
other
tolling
provisions
throughout
the
law.
and
here
it's
clear
that
they...
they've
done
something
that
they
have
the
authority
to
do.
tolling
comports
completely
with
the
federalist
design
of
the
constitution,
enables
the
court's
consideration
of
what
court
is
best
positioned
to
adjudicate.
that
is
decidedly
a
jurisdictional
decision.
here...
and
it's...
and
it...
it
is
doing
that
by
allowing
the
courts
to
control
their
own
borders
of
what
is
appropriate
to
them
and
what
is
not.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
that
is
indeed
what
they've
said.
but
stewart
v.
kahn
says
otherwise.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
that
is
correct.
it
found
that
within
the
war
power,
congress
had
the
authority
to
toll
the
statute
of
limitations
in
a
state
action
brought
in
state
court.
obviously
then
there
is
no
tenth
amendment
overlay
that
prevents
the
use
of
that
war
powers
authority.
here
they
have
similar
authority,
both
in
article
i,
section
8,
to
establish
the
inferior
courts,
as
well
as
article
iii
where
there's
a
cognate
phrase,
and
that
authority
has
to
be
equivalent.
they've
used
that
authority
also
with
respect
to
bankruptcy,
again
deriving
from
section
8.
and
so
here
again
there's
no
question
that
these
other
tolling
provisions
have
been
properly
used.
no
one
has
questioned
their
constitutionality
in
recent
times,
and
this
simply
adopts
a
longstanding
congressional
approach
to
this
issue.
it's
one
that
this
court
has
previously
approved.
if...
if
the
respondent
has
his
way,
enormous
mischief
will
result.
you
leave
the
courts
with
a
hobbesian
choice,
a
choice
that
they
have
been
uncomfortable
with
in
which
you've
seen
courts
granting
motions
for
reconsideration,
courts
requiring
waivers
of
a
statute
of
limitations,
so
having
much
the
same
effect...
and
clearly
when
tolling
does
that,
it
is
clearly
appropriate
to
the
judicial
power...
and
in
other
instances,
simply
holding
onto
a
case
they
would
otherwise
allow
the
state
courts
to
do,
again
in
the
interest
of
the
federalist
overlay--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--but
that...
that's
an
unworkable
solution.
congress
sought
to
avoid
that.
congress
wanted
to
give
a
federal
forum
capable
of
hearing
all
matters
that
a
plaintiff
would
expect
a
single
court
to
hear.
and
by
filing
a
protective
action
of
that
sort,
first
of
all,
you
could
not
stop
the
state
court
from
continuing
to
proceed,
possibly
eclipsing
in
speed
the
federal
court
and
coming
up
with
res
judicata
on
their
federal
claim,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
you
may
be
signaling
the
federal
court
that
on
the
state
matter
we
have
a
preference
to
be
in
state
court
when
that
really
isn't
the
case.
i...
i
would...
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
ask
that
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
be
reversed
and
would
waive
rebuttal.
