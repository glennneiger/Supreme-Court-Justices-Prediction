mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
enacting
section
1367(d),
congress
has
intruded
on
principles
of
state
sovereignty.
this
case
involves
more
than
just
the
tolling
of
a
state
law
statute
of
limitations.
it
involves,
in
this
particular
instance
where
a
political
subdivision
is
involved
and
south
carolina
law
is
involved,
specifically
the
south
carolina
tort
claims
act...
this
case
involves
a...
a
waiver
of
state
law
sovereign
immunity,
state
law
governmental
immunity.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
well,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that,
first
of
all,
the
issue
has
never
come
up,
never
been
litigated
in
this
court,
and
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
has
never
been
litigated
in
any
court
whether
or
not
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
act
in
any
application
is...
is
constitutional.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
no,
i
do
not
necessarily
believe
it
will
be
the
same
result.
i
believe
it
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
question
for
this
court
than
what
was
facing
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
and
is
presently
before
this
court.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
because
you
have
different
federal
interests
that
are
involved.
and
obviously,
in
determining
whether
or
not
the...
a
statute
is
proper
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
and
to
do
a
tenth
amendment
analysis,
you
have
to
look
at...
you
have
to
weigh
the
various
federal
and
state
interests
that
are
involved.
in
this
particular
case,
which
i'll
elaborate
more
momentarily,
you
have
very
superficial,
i
would
submit,
federal
interests
involved
compared
to
a
very
substantial
state
interest
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
state
and
its
political
subdivisions
are
subject
to
suit
under
state
law.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
i
would
disagree,
justice
stevens.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
act...
it
would
be
a
very
similar
intrusion
on
the...
on
the
state
sovereignty.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
the
bankruptcy...
the
actual...
any...
any
of
these
statutes
that
have
been
cited
by
the
petitioners
and
by
the
government
that
actually
provide
for
a
stay
of
a
state
court
action
i
think
are
substantially
different
because
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
a
stay
of
a
state
court
action,
whether
it's
pursuant
to
the
bankruptcy
code,
pursuant
to
the
removal
statutes,
any
of...
anti-injunction
act,
any
of
those
does
not
have
the
same
effect
upon
state
sovereignty
because
it's
not
changing
the
actual
liability
of
the
defendant,
in
this
particular
case,
richland--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--i--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--i...
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
justice
stevens,
because
what
has
occurred
in
this
particular
case
is
richland
county
was
entitled
to
state
law
sovereign
immunity
once
2
years
passed
from
the
date
of
the
loss.
and
at...
at
the
point
that
this
lawsuit
was
filed
in
state
court--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--well,
that's
why
i
was
trying
to
distinguish
the
stay
cases
from
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
act.
i
think
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
act
issue
is
a
much
closer
question
and
there
what
you're
weighing
is
much
more
substantial
federal
interests.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
well,
i
would...
i
would
submit
that
there
is
no
difference
in
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
context,
but
there
would
be
a
major
difference
in
any
of
the
situations
involving
a
stay.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
well
this,
your
honor,
is
not
a
case
involving
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
this
is
not
a
case
that
is
involving
federal
constitutional
immunity.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
this
is
a
case
that
was
brought...
a
negligence
case
that
was
brought
in
state
court
against
a
state
governmental...
or
a
local
governmental
entity
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
to
which
south
carolina
law
should
apply.
and
the
reason
why
we
contend
that
this
violates
the
tenth
amendment
is
it
intrudes
into
the
areas
of
state
sovereignty
to
determine,
number
one,
what
south
carolina
law
provides;
number
two,
how
south
carolina
law
determines
whether
or
not
their
own
governmental
entities
are
subject
to
suit.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
well,
it's
not
as
much
that
they're
trying
to
force
the
federal
court
to
litigate
the
case.
obviously,
the
plaintiff
chose
that
forum
to
start
with.
and
congress
has
deemed...
has
provided
for
supplemental
jurisdiction.
so
obviously
congress
has
provided
a
forum
in
federal
court
for
the
litigation
of
these
state
law
claims.
and
so
south
carolina
has
not
said,
you
can't
give
it
back
to
us,
but
what
south
carolina
had
said
is
that
in
the
interim,
if
there's
a
dismissal
without
prejudice
of
the
state
law
claims
in
another
court,
whether
it
be
the
federal
district
court
or
whether
it
be
in
a
court
of
another
state,
if
there's
a
dismissal
without
prejudice
under
south
carolina
law,
that's
considered
as
if
the
suit
had
never
been
brought
in
the
first
place.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
i
don't
believe
the
interest
here
is
that
south
carolina
has
a
problem
with...
with
the
federal
court
deciding
issues
of
state
law,
and
i
don't
think
south
carolina
has
a
problem
with
deciding
those
issues
itself.
the
problem
south
carolina
has
in
this
particular
case
is
with
congress
expanding
upon
state
law
that
actually
set
the
boundaries
as
to
when
and
how
a
political
subdivision
can
be
sued.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
south...
yes,
the
congress
would
be
intruding
upon--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--the
ability
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
to
set
a
statute
of
limitations
for
private
defendants.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court
two
points
in
response
to
that.
it
goes
beyond
because
it's
a
governmental
entity
and
you
look
at
the
application
of
state
law
because
again,
this
is
a
state
law
case
brought
and
adjudicated
in
a
state
court.
and
you
look
at
the
state
law
which
actually
provides
a
greater
defense
for
a
governmental
entity
than
it
does
for
a
private
citizen.
to
give
the
court
an
illustration--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--no,
it
would
not
change
the
case.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
my
point
is
it...
it
actually
makes
a
stronger
case
to
show
the
intrusion
on
state
sovereignty
where
you
have
a
political
subdivision.
and
if
i
may
illustrate.
prior
to
1985,
south
carolina
recognized
absolute
sovereign
immunity
for
its
state
entities
as
well
as
its
political
subdivisions.
and
if
you
looked
at...
the
question
that
comes
to
mind
is
whether
congress,
prior
to
1985,
could
have
enacted
a
statute
that
subjects
richland
county,
a
political
subdivision
in
the
state
of
south
carolina,
to
a
claim
for
negligence
in
the
operation
of
its
local
detention
center
where
south
carolina
law
itself
provides
there
is
no
such
claim
because
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
i
respectfully
disagree
with
you,
justice
breyer.
if,
prior
to
1985,
congress
wanted
to
create
a
situation
where
richland
county
would
be
liable
for
the
operation
of
its
detention
center,
it
would
have
to
do
so
in
the
context
of
a
federal
cause
of
action
which
obviously
existed
at
that
time
under
section
1983.
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--well,
i
believe
tort
reform
in
certain
instances
would
be
permissible.
i...
i
believe
that...
and
certainly
the...
the
precedent
set
by
this
court
supports
this...
that
congress
has
the
authority
through
preemption
and
through
its
properly
enacted
statutes
to
limit
the
liability
in
state
court
actions...
in
state
law
actions,
but
cannot
create
liability
where
none
existed
previously.
and
i'd
submit
to
the
court
that
i'm
not
aware
of
any
single
example
where
congress
has
stepped
in
and
created
a
statute
that
creates
a...
a
state
law
cause
of
action
or
expands
upon
a
state
law
cause
of
action
to
create
liability
where
none
existed.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
well,
and
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
relief
act,
if
it
is
indeed
constitutional,
is
based
upon
a
different
weighing
of
the
federal
interest
versus
the
state
interest.
you
obviously
in
that
case
have
much
greater
federal
interest
involved
than
the
simple
convenience
to
litigants
to
have
to
be
able
to
be...
have
the
ability
to
file
your
federal
and
state
claims
in
the
same
federal
action
without
concern
that
your
state
action
might
ultimately
be
dismissed
after
the
statute
of
limitations
ran.
obviously
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
act
involves
first
amendment
war
powers.
it
involves
issues
of
national
defense
and
deployment
of
armed
services
around
the
country
where
they're
not
available
to...
where
they
don't
have
the
immediate
availability
of
access
to
our
court
system.
those
are
much
different
rights,
much
different
federal
interests,
and
would
create
a
much
different
issue.
and
how
this
court
would
ultimately
resolve
that
issue
i
cannot
say,
but
it
would
certainly
make
a
much
stronger
case
for
allowing
that
than
the
simple
case
that
is...
or
the
federal
interests
that
are
at
stake
in
this
particular
instance.
the--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--that...
that
happened
frequently
prior
to
1990,
and
i'm
actually
aware
of...
personally
of
instances
even
since
1990
where
that's
been
the
case--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--and
that
obviously
is
the
solution.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
that's
right.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
that
would
be
perfectly
all
right,
and
in
fact--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--but
realistically
looking
at
the
way
1367(d)
operates
anyway
is
you
often
do
have
two
separate
lawsuits
such
as
what
we
have
in
this
particular
instance.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
there
are
many
different
alternatives
that
courts
dealt
with
this
issue
prior
to
1990.
and
in
fact,
i'd
submit
that
there's
certainly
no
authority
to
support
any
finding
or
any
conclusion
that
litigants'
due
process
rights
were
violated
before
1367(d)
was
enacted.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
well,
and...
and
that
is
true.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
i'm
not
aware
of
that--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--well,
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
that
is
certainly
not
a
very
substantial
federal
interest
to
the
extent
it
is
a
federal
interest.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
well,
i
don't
believe
it...
it
creates
unfairness
necessary
to
litigants,
and
there
are
obviously
solutions
around
it...
and
was
dealt
with
by...
many
courts
dealt
with
this
particular
issue
prior
to
1990.
and
i
would
submit
that
when
you
balance
that
federal
interest
with
the
state
interests
that
are
involved
here
and...
which
is
obviously
what...
what's
the
analysis
under
the
tenth
amendment,
that
the
result
should
be
that
the
state
interests
involved
to
be
able
to
control
state
law
and
state
law
claims,
to
be
able
to
control
when
and
how
state...
states
and
their
political
subdivisions
are
subject
to
suit
under
state
law,
that
those
interests
far
outweigh
the
federal
interest.
obviously
it
is
a
balancing
problem.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
well--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--well,
i
believe
in
this--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--well,
there...
there's
clearly
no...
no
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
congress
made
that
particular
balancing.
in
fact,
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--well,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
just
as
this
court
ruled
in
the
raygor
case
last
term
in
the
tenth
amendment
context,
just
like
in
the
eleventh
amendment
context--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--you
have
to
look
at
whether
or
not
there's
a
clear
statement
that
congress
intended
to
affect
federal-state
relations
such
as
it
did.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
well,
i
would...
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
if...
if
your
honor
is
suggesting
that
only
comes
into
play
in
eleventh
amendment
cases,
that...
that...
i
would
disagree
with
that
because
gregory
versus
ashcroft
was
a
tenth
amendment
case
and
this
court
ruled
based
upon
the
clear
statement
rule.
now,
whether
or
not
a
party
has
standing
to
assert--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--that
was
a
case.
it
was
a...
a
adea
case,
your
honor,
looking
at
the
qualifications
of
state
judges
in
the
state
of
missouri.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
that's
why
we
are
not
pursuing
this
matter
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
however,
a
municipality
has
standing
to
assert
a
challenge
under
the
tenth
amendment,
and
this
court
in
the
printz
case,
printz
v.
united
states,
was
actually--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
we...
we
are
certainly
not
arguing
that
1367(d)
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to...
i
mean,
(a)
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
richland
county.
what
we're
arguing
is
that
the
expansion
of
the
state
law
statute
of
limitations
and
the
limited
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
under
state
law
is
what,
as
applied
in
this
particular
case,
violates
the
tenth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
well,
your
honor,
obviously
a
removal
situation
is
substantially
different
in
that
jurisdiction
was
first
lodged
in
the
state
court,
and
as
a
result,
any
type
of
waiver
issue
or
any
type
of
statute
of
limitations
issue
would
be
resolved
by
the
fact
that
there
was
a
initial
filing
of
the
state
court
claim
in
the
state
court.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
it's
not
so...
as
your
honor
pointed
out
earlier,
it's
not
solely
an
issue
of
repose
because
here
because
the
respondent,
the
defendant
in
the...
in
the
underlying
case
is
a
governmental
entity,
there
is
a
aspect
of
state
sovereign
immunity
that
comes
into
play
that
doesn't
come
into
play
in...
in
the
other
instances.
and
so
you
have
the
added
interest
of
preserving
the
right
of
the
state
in
order
to
determine
whether
it's
going
to
waive
its
sovereign
immunity,
which
of
course
didn't
happen
until
1985,
and
when
it
does
waive
sovereign
immunity,
the
extent
to
which
it's
going
to
waive
it.
and
again,
i'm
referring
to
state
law
sovereign
immunity,
not
federal
constitutional
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment
or
otherwise.
so
what--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--well--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--because
it
goes,
your
honor,
to
the
heart
of
exactly
what
the...
the
state
sovereignty,
the
interests
of
state
sovereignty
that's
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
well,
i'm
not
submitting
that
it
creates
any
type
of
new
doctrine,
your
honor.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it's
an
aspect
of
state
sovereignty
for
a
state
court...
i
mean,
for
a
state
legislature
to
determine
what
the
law
is
in
that
state
that
is
applicable
purely
to
state
law
claims
litigated
in
a
state
court.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
well,
i
believe
it
would
also
apply
to
a
private
litigant,
and
i
didn't
try
to
convey
to
the
court--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
to
the
court
is
because
you
have
this
added
element
of
state
law
sovereign
immunity,
which
is
created
by
the
state
constitution,
it
makes
it
even
a
more
compelling
tenth
amendment--
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
--i
believe
that
would
be
the
case.
now,
that's
not
the
issue,
obviously,
before
this
court
and
that's
not
decided
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
decided
this
case
in
a
very
limited
fashion
and
found
that
1367(d)
as
applied
to
political
subdivisions
in
south
carolina,
given
the
south
carolina
tort
claims
act
and
the
history
of
sovereign
immunity...
state
law
sovereign
immunity
in
that
state,
that
as
a
result,
as
applied
to
richland
county,
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
no,
your
honor.
i
would...
i
would
submit
that
the
statute
of
limitations
started
to...
or
ran
from
obviously
the
date
of
loss
through...
through
for
the
two-year
period,
and
if
the
case
was
filed
in
federal
court
within
that
two-year
period,
the
statute
of
limitations,
as
well
as
the...
the
argument
that
sovereign
immunity
applies,
would
not
be
applicable
to
that
case.
but
what
occurred
in
this
case
is
there
was
a
dismissal
without
prejudice
of
the
state
law
claims.
under
south
carolina
law,
a
dismissal
with
prejudice
is
treated
as
if
the
suit
was
never
brought
in
the
first
place.
and
as
a
result,
when
the
case
was
refiled
in
the
state
court,
it
was
refiled
beyond
the
two
years,
at
which
point
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run
and
at
which
point
richland
county
was
also
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
under
the
south
carolina
tort
claims
act.
and
i
would
again
submit
to
the
court
that
the
reason
why
we
believe
that
this
is
a
significant
issue
under
the
tenth
amendment
for
this
case
and
why
the
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence
of
this
court
does
not
govern
is...
is
because
of
the
importance
of
the
state
law
interest.
and
the
key
to
this
whole
argument
is
the
point
that
this
is
not
a
federal
claim
litigated
in
federal
court.
in
fact,
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
by
the
petitioner
in
their
briefs,
the
burnett
case,
the
order
of
railroad
engineers
case,
all
of
those
cases
are
distinguishable
because
those
are
federal
causes
of
action
that
are
litigated
in
federal
court.
this
is
a
state
law
claim
that's
litigated
in
state
court
under
purely
state
law,
and
we
would
submit
that
the
south
carolina
general
assembly
should
decide
what
is
the
applicable
south
carolina
law
and
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power
under
article
iii
and
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
to
override
that
statement
of
state
law
and
to
create
liability
where
no
liability
previously
existed.
and
that
is
the
key
point.
congress
has
the
authority
through
a
validly
enacted
statute
and
through
use
of
the
supremacy
clause
to
limit
liability
in
state
actions
by
providing
for
preemption,
erisa
being
an
example,
but
there
is
no
example
that
i'm
aware
of
where
congress
has
created
liability
where
none
previously
existed.
mr.
andrew
f.
lindemann
thank
you,
your
honor.
