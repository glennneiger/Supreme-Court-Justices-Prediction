mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
tolling
provision
at
issue
here
is
within
congress'
constitutional
powers
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
establishes
the
legal
effect
of
a
distinctly
federal
set
of
events:
the
filing,
pendency,
and
dismissal
of
an
action
in
federal
court
over
a
defendant
over
whom
the
court
can
exercise
jurisdiction.
second,
it
serves
legitimate
federal
interests,
ensuring
that
if
plaintiffs
are
held
harmless
for
having
selected
a
federal
forum
in
the
first
instance
and
ensuring
that
federal
courts
are
not
required
to
exercise
jurisdiction
and
decide
cases
that
involve
potentially
sensitive
issues
of
state
law
that
are
more
reliably
and
more
appropriately
decided
in
the
state
court.
because
municipalities
are
not
states
or
arms
of
the
states,
sovereign
immunity
does
not
prevent
them
from
being
hailed
into
federal
court
and
it
doesn't
prevent
the
federal
courts
from
exercising
jurisdiction
over
cases
against
them,
including
supplemental
state
law
claims.
congress
can
establish
the
rules
for
when
federal
courts
should
hear
such
claims
and
the
rules
for
when
they
should
not.
congress
has
corresponding
authority
to
establish
reasonable
rules
about
the
legal
consequences
of
the
pendency
of
the
federal
action,
of
the
filing
of
the
claim,
its
pendency,
and
the
court's
decision
to
dismiss
it
under
specified
rules
that
congress
itself
has
established.
the
rule
established
here
falls
within
the
tradition
of
federal
control
over
the
effect
of
federal
proceedings.
it
falls
in
the
tradition
of,
for
example,
legal
effect
of
the
filing
of
a
bankruptcy
petition
which
stays
all
the
actions
that
are
against
the
debtor
and
tolls
the
state
limitations
periods
during
the
pendency
of
the
automatic
stay.
or
the
removal
provision
which
takes
cases
out
of
state
courts,
stays
the
proceedings
in
state
courts,
and
thus
prevents
the
state
courts
from
proceeding
in
a
way
such
as
by
deeming
the
case
constructively
dismissed
that
might
have
the
effect
of
causing
the
statute
of
limitations
to
continue
to
run.
and
the
effect
of
a
federal...
a
judgment
of
a
federal
court
case.
all
these
are
matters
that
are
controlled
by
federal
law,
and
that
federal
law
is
no
less
binding
on
state
courts
adjudicating
state
causes
of
action,
including
against
municipalities,
than
they
are
on
federal
courts.
the
rule
in
this
case
serves
twin
federal
interests.
first,
it
holds
plaintiffs
harmless
for
having
selected
a
forum...
a
state...
excuse
me...
a
federal
rather
than
a
state
forum
in
the
first
instance.
absent
this
sort
of
rule,
plaintiffs
would
face
the
risk,
if
they
chose
a
federal
forum,
of
having
the
statute
of
limitations
run
on
their
state
law
claims.
if
the
federal
court
then
chose
to
dismiss,
those
state
law
claims
would
be
barred.
and
plaintiffs
would
have
an
artificial
incentive
to
avoid
federal
court,
including
for
the
assertion
of
their
federal
law
claims.
it
also
serves
the
interests
of
federal
courts
in
ensuring
that
they
don't
have
to
decide
state
law
claims
that
are
potentially
sensitive,
that
under
the
standards
this
court
articulated
in
gibbs
that
congress
has
codified
in
section
1367(c)
and
it
reflects
sensible
notions
of
division
between
state
and
federal
authority
more
appropriately
belong
in
state
court
and
can
be
more
reliably
adjudicated
there.
this
court's
decision
in
stewart
v.
kahn
establishes
that
there
is
no
constitutional
impediment
to
congressional
preemption
of
state
tolling
rules
if
it
serves
a
legitimate
federal
interest,
the
tolling
provision
here,
like
the
social...
excuse
me...
like
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
relief
act,
the
bankruptcy
automatic
stay
tolling
rule,
following
that
tradition.
finally,
the
tolling
rule
here
intrudes
only
modestly
on
state
interests.
the
timely
filing
of
the
state
claims
in
federal
court
serves
all
of
the
statute
of
limitations
purposes
as
the
claim...
as
the
timely
filing
of
those
same
claims
in
state
court.
accordingly,
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
state
supreme
court
be
reversed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
