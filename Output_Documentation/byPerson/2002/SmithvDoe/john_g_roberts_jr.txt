mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
alaska's
megan's
law
makes
available
to
members
of
the
public
who
seek
it
certain
truthful
information
about
convicted
sex
offenders.
the
state
makes
this
information
available
to
help
protect
against
the
risk
that
the
convicted
sex
offender
will
offend
again.
it
says
that
in
the
law.
sex
offenses
are
crimes
of
opportunity,
and
the
purpose
of
making
the
information
available
is
to
allow
the
members
of
the
public
to
take
steps
to
reduce
those
opportunities.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it
wouldn't,
your
honor.
that's
the
case
in...
in
about
14
states
that...
that
a
quarterly
verification
has
to
be
in
person.
it
is
not
the
case
in
alaska.
and
simply
going
to
the
police
station
four
times
a
year,
which
is
reserved
only
for
the
most
serious
sex
offenses,
the
aggravated
offenses...
in
all
other
cases
it's
just
annually...
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
a
burden
that
is
at
all
tantamount
to
what
we
think
of
as
punishment
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in-person
registration?
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
of
one
where
you
actually
have
to
show
up
in
person,
but
the
question
is
whether
that
in-person
requirement
is
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
regulatory
purpose.
that's
the
standard
under
cases
like
flemming.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
do
not.
it
clearly--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--even
for
aggravated
offenses.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
expressly
can
be
filed
by
mail.
the
instructions
make
that
clear.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
statute
says
the
initial
registration
has
to
be
in
person.
typically
it's
in...
in
prison.
and
then
it
says
the
later
verification
has
to
be
in
writing.
so
i
think
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
reading
of
the
statute
to
say
that
the
later
verification
had
to
be
in
writing.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
question
is
whether
the
burdens
that
the
law
imposes
constitute
punishment.
if
it's
not
punishment,
then
it's
perfectly
valid
to
apply
it
to
people
who
were
convicted
prior
to
the
effective
date.
and
this
is
not--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--only
the
ex
post
facto
challenge
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
for
life,
again
only
for
aggravated;
for
15
years
for
other
sex
offenses.
and
yes,
that
is
one
of
their
arguments,
that
they
can't
get
out
of
it.
but
this
court's
cases
haven't
drawn
that
line.
the
question
is
whether
the
burdens
are
pursuant
to
a
legitimate
regulatory
objective,
or
whether
they're
punitive.
for
example,
in
cases
like
kansas
against
hendricks,
couldn't
get
out
of
that,
and
yet
that
didn't
make
it
a
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
flemming
against
nestor.
you
couldn't
avoid
the
sanction
there,
and
yet
it
did
not
rise
to
the
level
of
punishment.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a...
a
particular
subclass,
yes.
it
was
an
individualized
determination
required
because
the
depravation
there,
actual
confinement,
was
far
more
severe
than
the
depravation
at
issue
here.
but
neither
an
individual
determination,
nor
a
chance
to
get
out
of
it
is
required
to
avoid
the
categorization
as
punishment.
cases
like
hawker
and
de
veau
make
clear
that
a...
a
reasonable
legislature
can
treat
a
category...
a
category
of
sex
offenders.
they
don't--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--hawker
was--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--not
true,
of
course,
in
hendricks
or
flemming
or
salerno,
no
opportunity
to
avoid
it
there.
you
didn't
have
to
do
anything
to
get
the
sanction
applied
to
you.
now--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
have
to
register.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you...
you
have
to
fill
out--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--one...
one
side
of
one
page.
that's
the
form
that's
involved
here.
that
in
itself
cannot
be
punishment.
we...
as
your
honor
mentioned...
we
do
that
all
the
time
in...
in
today's
society.
so
it
must
be
something
else
that
makes
this
punishment.
now,
what
the
ninth
circuit's...
ninth
circuit
thought
was
that
it
was
publishing
it
on
the
internet,
that
that
made
it
punishment.
but
that's
simply
the
most...
most
efficient
and
most
economical
way
of
making
information
available.
it
also
is
passive.
it's
not
displayed
to
people
who
have
no
interest
in
the
information,
and
in
that
sense
is
far
less
invasive.
the
publication
on
the
internet
will...
yes,
it
may
cause
adverse
consequences
when
members
of
the
community
learn
this
public
fact
about
someone's
past.
but
the
state
is
certainly
free
to
weigh
the
convicted
sex
offender's
interest
in
keeping
that
public
fact
from
being
widely
known
against
the
interest
of
those
in
the
position
of,
say,
megan
kanka's
parents.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
"weigh".
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
weigh
the
convicted
sex
offender's
interest
in
keeping
a
public
fact
about
his
past
secret
against
megan
kanka's
parents'
interest
in
knowing
that
their
new
neighbor
across
the
street
had
twice
been
convicted
of
sexually
abusing
young
girls.
that's
a
determination
for
the
legislature
to
make.
there
are
costs--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
and
all
the
state
is
doing--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
there
are
countless
analogues
in
the
regulatory
regime
where
people
have
to
file
quarterly
reports.
if...
and...
and
the
question
is
whether
that
requirement
serves
a
valid
regulatory
purpose.
it
can't
rise
to
the
level
of
punishment
just
because
the
legislature
has
determined
that
the
triggering
event--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there
are...
there
are
many
disabilities
that
are
imposed
as
a
result
of
a
prior
conviction
that
the
court
has
found
don't
constitute
punishment.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
affirmative
steps...
it...
that
has
never
been
the
test.
the
test
has
been
whether
it
rises
to
the
level
of
punishment.
yes,
the
affirmative
step
of
filling
out
one
side
of
one
page
with
the
sort
of
information
that
you'd...
would
put
on
your
application
to
join
the
price
club
requires.
there's
nothing
burdensome
about
that.
it
must
be
in
their
argument
the
use
that
that
information
is
put
to.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
when
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
called
the
intent
effects
test.
you'd
first
see
what
the
intent
is,
and
that
is
so
critical,
and
nearly
controlling
because
the
same
sanction
can
be
punitive
or
civil
depending
on
the
purpose.
even
confinement
can
be
civil
if
the
purpose
is
protective.
so
that's
why
purpose
is
so
controlling.
now,
once
you
determined
that
there's
a
regulatory
purpose,
as
every
court
has...
not
just
every
federal
court...
every
court
to
look
at
these
laws
has
determined
they
have
a
valid
civil
regulatory
purpose...
then
the
one
challenging
that
determination
carries
the
heavy
burden
of
establishing,
by
the
clearest
proof,
with
unmistakable
evidence,
that
the
effect
is
so
punitive
that
the
purported
purpose
must,
in
fact,
be
a
charade.
and--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
that
information
is
available.
the
circumstances,
the
crime
for
which
the
person
is
convicted,
is
available.
so--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
my
understanding,
your
honor,
yes,
that...
that...
i'm
not
sure
what
it
is
in
every
state,
but
the...
the
circumstances
of
conviction
is...
it's
one
of
the
things
that
has
to
be
registered,
and
is
available
to
the
public.
so
if
it...
you
can
find
out
what
the
conviction
was
for.
now,
i
don't...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
conveys
simply
the
truthful,
objective
information
that
this
individual
was
convicted
of
this
crime,
and
the
public
is
free
to
take
appropriate
action
if
they
think
that's...
that's
appropriate
under
the
circumstances.
it
is
different
from
the
historic
shaming
penalties
because
of
the
purpose.
and
again,
purpose
is
the
nearly
controlling
factor.
the
purpose
of
the
shaming
penalties
was
not
to
inform.
everybody
in
the
colonial
village
knew
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
the
purpose
was
to
shame.
here,
the
purpose
is
to
inform.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
conveys
the
information
that
the
legislature
thought
was
pertinent
for
people
to
take
action
to
protect
themselves
if
they
think
it's
warranted.
nothing
prevents
them
from
finding
out
more
if
they
want
to...
if
they
think
that's
pertinent--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
access
to
the
information
that
the
legislature
thought
was
pertinent
and
that
people
wanted
to
learn.
there
is
no
requirement--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there's
no
provision
for
that
under
alaska's
laws.
i
am
aware
of
situations
where...
where
they
have
a
more
active
notification,
where
the
offenders
have
taken
steps
to
say,
well,
here's
my
side
of
the
story,
but
there's
no
provision
for
that
on
the
internet.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
might
violate
the
due
process
clause
if
there's
not
a
rational
connection
between--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
legislature
would
have
to
show
a
rational
basis
for
its
categorization.
that's
the
standard--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--or...
it
may
or
may
not,
depending
on
what
it
shows.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
here
the
legislature
had
a
solid
basis,
a
basis
that
this--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--court
has
recognized,
as
recently
as
last
june
in
the
mckune
case,
for
the
conclusion
that
those
convicted
have
a
high
rate
of
recidivism.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
understood
the
question
to
be
it's
just
the
beginning
of
the
whole
story,
and
in
that
case,
i'd
question
whether--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
there
wouldn't
be--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--certainly
not
the
ex
post
facto
clause
because
in
seling
against
young,
the
court
said
you
look
at
the
law
on
its
face,
not
as
applied.
halper
had
started
looking
at
laws
as
applied
to
determine
whether
they're
punishment,
and
in
hudson
and
in
seling,
the
court
said
we're
not
going
to
do
that.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
place
the
various
points
that
have
been
touched
on
this
morning
in
the
proper
legal
framework.
the
question,
justice
kennedy,
is
not
whether
it's
burdensome
to
require
someone
to
fill
out
a
form
and
verify
it.
the
question
is,
is
that
so
punitive
that
you
don't
believe
the
legislature
when
it
says
that
we're
doing
this
to
prevent
future
harm?
the
question,
justice
ginsburg,
is
not
whether
it
might
be
a
better
system
if
it
included
other
information,
or
whether
that
would
be
too
burdensome
for
the
state.
the
question
is,
does
the
failure
to
put
on
ameliorative
information
convince
you
that
the
legislature
was
simply
not
telling
the
truth
when
it
said
we're
doing
this
to
prevent
future
harm?
and
the
question
is
not
whether
you
should
have
an
individualized
determination
or
a
group
determination.
it
is,
is
the
group
determination
so
irrational
that
you
think
the
legislature
was
not
really
interested
in
preventing
future
harm,
it
was
just
doing
this
to
punish?
in
fact,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
this
court
has
never
found
a
law
with
a
civil
regulatory
purpose
to
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that
is--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
it
only
makes
sense
if
you
view
it
as
impeaching
the
intent
because,
as
chief
justice
warren
pointed
out
in
trop
v.
dulles,
the
evident
purpose
is
controlling
because
the
same
sanction
can
be
civil
or
criminal.
$10,000
civil
penalty
is
not
criminal.
a
$10,000
fine
is.
you
don't
look
at
the
perspective
of
the
individual
because--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
if
the
regulation
is
so
burdensome
that
it
causes
you
to
doubt
the
intent,
then
you
do
have
a
problem,
but
that
is
the
purpose.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
again,
with
respect
to
both
the
ex
post
facto
clause
and
the
due
process
clause,
the
question
is
whether
there's
a
rational
connection
between
the
sanction
and
the
legislative
purpose.
now,
if
it
is
too
extreme,
it
may
cause
you
to
doubt
that
connection.
for
example,
it
may
be...
the
legislature
may
say
we
think
safe
crackers
present
a
risk
of
recidivism,
so
we're
going
to
cut
off
their
hands.
there
may
be
a
rational
connection
there,
but
it's
too
excessive
given
the
purpose.
there's
no
way
in
which
this
law
can
be
regarded
as
too
excessive.
it
simply
makes
available
information
that
is
already
a
matter
of
public
record,
and
publicly
available
because
criminal
trials
under
our
system
have
to
be
public.
thank
you,
your
honor.
