unknown
speaker
one...
one
line
that
i...
i
think
there
is
respondents
seek
to
establish
in
this
case
is
that
this
information
has
to
be
generated
by
acts
that
occur
after
the
conviction.
you
have
to
fill
out
the
form
some...
four
times
a
year,
et
cetera.
i...
i've
read
in
the
brief...
i'm
sure
my
colleagues
have
too
the...
the
problem
about
going
to
the
police
station.
just
assume
hypothetically
that
you
had
to
go
to
the
police
station
four
times
a
year.
would
that
change
the
case?
unknown
speaker
i
have
forms
i
have
to
fill
out
four
times
a
year
for
the
government.
i'm
always
afraid
i'm
going
to
miss
the
deadline.
if
i
had
to
present
myself
to
a...
a
policeman,
which
is
itself
i
think
demeaning,
i...
i
just
don't
know
any
analogue
for...
is
there
any
analogue
for
that
in...
in
regulation
of--
unknown
speaker
--the
regulation
of
regulated
industries
or
things
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
roberts,
do
they
in
alaska
have
to
go
personally
or
not?
unknown
speaker
even
for
aggravated
offenses?
unknown
speaker
and
it
can
be
filed
by
mail.
or
how?
unknown
speaker
could...
could
the
administrative
authorities
interpret
the
statute
so
that
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
station
without
amending
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
an
issue
here
because
this
law
was
passed
after
a
number
of
the
people
affected
by
it
had
already
been
convicted,
and
so
there
are
allegations
of
retroactivity
concerns?
unknown
speaker
mr.
roberts,
the
only
challenge
in
this
case
is
to
the
retroactivity.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
because
these
people
were
tried,
convicted,
served
their
time
before
the
passage
of
the
act.
unknown
speaker
and
their
principal
complaint,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
this
is
punishment
because
we
can't
get
out.
there's
no
escape
from
it.
we
can
prove
with
expert
testimony
that
we
are
cured.
nothing
will
get
us
out
from
under
this
demeaning
regime,
that
much
more
than
the
burden
of
going
to
a
police
station,
that
that's
what
it's
about,
that
we're
locked
into
this
for
life
and
it
has
a
devastating
effect
on
our
lives.
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
a...
there
was
a
determination,
at
least
in
hendricks,
that
you
fit...
currently
fit
into
a
certain
category.
unknown
speaker
but
in
hawker,
you
didn't
have
to
do
anything.
here--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
like
to
use
the
word
"affirmative
action",
because
that
has
a
connotation
in
some
other...
but
you
have
to
take
an...
affirmative
steps
for
the
rest
of
your
life
in...
in
some
cases.
and
this...
and
this
seems
to
me
very,
very
burdensome
and
to
differentiate
this
class.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
i
was...
i
was
saying
but
the
requirement
of
the
statute
is
that
for
the
rest
of
your
life
you
have
to
take
affirmative
steps
to...
to
re-register--
unknown
speaker
--and
to
list
all
your
automobiles
and...
and
to
show
that
you've--
unknown
speaker
--shaved
your
beard
or
something.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
roberts.
i
mean,
"waive"
is
something
a
person
does--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
i
thought
you
said
"waive".
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
get
that
from
the
record
of
conviction.
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
statute
we
have
here,
you
have
affirmative
steps
that
have
to
be
taken
for
the
rest
of
the
person's
life
if
he's
a
violent
offender,
to
report
four
times
a
year.
i
just
don't
know
any
analogue
for
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
suppose
that's
because
you
choose
to
be
in
a
regulated
industry,
or
you
choose
to
have
this
withholding
regime.
and
it's...
it's
not
imposed
on
a
class
of
citizens
by
reason
of
their
criminal
past.
unknown
speaker
none
which
require
affirmative
steps.
unknown
speaker
what
is
our
test
for
whether
it
rises
to
the
level
of
punishment?
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
ninth
circuit
found...
find
there
was
no
intent
to
make
it
punitive,
but
looked
to
the
effects?
unknown
speaker
is
it
an
effects
test
and
how
do
we
apply
it--
unknown
speaker
--but
why
isn't
the
evidence
that
this
is...
is
a
face
plastered
on
the
internet,
that
in
modern
times
that
is
the
equivalent
of
the
town
square
where
you're
shaming
the
bad
actor?
and
here,
you
have
a
person's
face,
and
you
have
only
the
bad
information.
you
don't
get
the
information
that
this
person
has
successfully
completed
a
rehabilitation
course.
you
don't
get
the
information
that
this
was
on
the
scale
of
sexual
offenses
on
the
lighter
side.
the...
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
is
it...
that's
on
the
page...
the
page
with
the
photograph
says
what
the
crime
was?
unknown
speaker
in
addition,
on
that
page,
what
the
viewer
will
see...
you
don't
see
on
the
page
with
the
face
any
disclaimer,
any
statement
that
the
state
is
not
branding
this
person
as
dangerous.
the
state
is
simply
making
a
statement
that
there
was
a
conviction
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
mr.
roberts,
on
that
point
you
said
this
is
truthful
information,
and
it
is.
my
question
is,
isn't...
it's
not
the
whole
truth
because
the
successful
rehabilitation
in
one
case
is
not
known.
it's
not
known
in
the
other
case
that
a
judge
determined
this...
this
person
had
been
cured
to
the
extent
that
he
could
have
the
custody
of
a...
a
minor
child.
that
information
is
not
known.
so
the...
the
public
is
getting
only
the
bad,
and
not
the
good.
its
judgment
is
being
skewed.
and
that's
why
it
has
a
punitive
flavor.
unknown
speaker
but
nothing
would
prevent
anybody
from
going
to
the
court,
or
the
police
station
and
getting
a
record
of
a
particular
person.
it's
made
easy
for
them
by
the
state...
access
is
made
easy...
but
only
access
to
the
bad
information.
unknown
speaker
mr.
roberts,
would
it
be
possible
for
a
defendant
to
include
additional
information
on
the
form,
and
if
so,
would
it
appear
on
the
internet?
unknown
speaker
suppose
they
had
the
same
statute,
but
instead
of
it...
applying
it
to
people
who
were
convicted,
they
applied
it
to
people
who
had
been
arrested,
or
alternatively,
they
applied
it
to
people
whom
a
policeman
said
he
had
gotten
suspicious
information
about
that
he
believed
was
accurate,
no
arrest...
now,
suppose
it's
exactly
the
same,
but
they
just
do...
they
apply
it
not
in
that
way.
what
part
of
the
constitution,
if
any,
would
that
violate?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
rational
in
the
sense
that
a...
a
reasonable
person
would
think
that
these...
it's
a
way
of
stopping
these,
you
know,
criminals.
they're
suspicious.
they're...
they're...
suspicious
people
against
whom
there
are
suspicions
are
more
likely
to
commit
crimes
than
people
who
are
not
suspected.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
your
answer
is
it
violates
substantive
due
process
or
nothing.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
i've
got
that.
i--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
assuming
from
justice
breyer's
hypothesis,
mr.
roberts,
that
the
policeman
who
has
spotted
some
suspicious...
that
these
people
have
previously
been
convicted,
or
that
this
is
just
the...
the
beginning
of
the
whole
story
is
that
a
policeman
spots
someone?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
certainly
no
ex
post
facto
problem
there,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
no,
what
i
was
driving
at
is
suppose
that
this
statute
too
is...
i...
suppose
i
were
to
believe
it
was
excessive
in
light
of
its
purpose
in
respect
to
some...
some
people,
but
not
to
others.
what
part
of
the
constitution
would
it
violate,
if
any?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
general
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
that
the
public
in
theory
has
access
to
it
anyway
because
convictions
are
a
matter
of
public
record,
and
presumably
any
citizen
who
wanted
to
dig
deep
enough
could
find
out
who
had
been
convicted
of
what.
what
this
scheme
involves
is
getting
a
big
megaphone,
in
effect,
making
it
more
readily
available.
is
that
what
we're
talking
about
here?
unknown
speaker
but
it
isn't
passive
because
you
have
a
lifetime
obligation
to
update
it.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
passive.
unknown
speaker
now
we're
up
to
minimally
passive.
unknown
speaker
and
most...
most
of
those
do
not
involve...
involve
shame
or
ridicule.
this
does.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
precisely,
but
that...
that
shows
that
there's
an
added
burden
here
that
was
added
by
the
state
after
the
conviction.
unknown
speaker
if
a
banker
or
securities
dealer
were
convicted
of...
of...
of
a
crime,
could
the
government
after
the
fact...
prospective...
pardon
me...
retroactively...
retroactively
require
that
he
or
she
file
their...
their
earnings
statements
for
the
rest
of
their
life
with
some
regulatory
agency?
unknown
speaker
but,
general
olson,
there's
a...
a
difference
in
those...
those
restrictions
that
affect
one
part
of
one's
life.
i
can't
practice
a
particular
profession,
but
i
can
go
out
and
get
a
job.
i...
i'm
not
affected
in
where
i
live.
my
neighbors
know
that
i've
committed
a
crime,
but
they
don't...
the
same
reaction...
the
notion
that
i
am
being
labeled
not
a
convicted
offender...
which
i
am...
but
a
sex
offender,
a
current
status...
a
current
status
with
no
opportunity
to
get
out.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it's...
it's
easy
for
a
legislature
to
say
that,
and
in
part,
it's
right.
but
in
part,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
many
indicia
of
punishment
here
as
well.
that's
why
you
just
don't
rest
when
the
legislature
says
it's
regulatory.
you
must
go
beyond
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
formal
restriction
on
employment,
but
it...
in
many
of
these
cases,
these
people
have
terrible
times
renting
a
place
to
live,
getting
a
job.
unknown
speaker
no.
with...
with--
unknown
speaker
--with
respect,
mr.
olson,
i
mean,
i
think
that's
what's
bothering
us.
the...
the
offense
has
resulted
in
a
conviction
and
a
penalty.
each
is
a
one-time
event,
as
it
were,
or
a
one-time
status
and
each
is
over.
what
this
is
doing
is,
in
effect,
imposing
a
status
of
public
shame
for
a
period
of
10
years,
or
whatever
it
is,
or
a
period
of
life
in...
in
the
case
of
certain
offenses.
and
that
is
not
merely
the
consequence
of
the
conviction
for
the
crime
which
was
defined,
is
over,
and
done
with.
this
is
something
new.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that?
i...
i
understand
that
the...
the
percentage
of
sex
offenses
in
alaska
with
children
is
extremely
high,
and
what
is...
has
been
the
effect
of
this
scheme
if
it's
been
employed?
has
it
had
some
effect
there--
unknown
speaker
--in
reducing
the
number
of
sex
offenses?
unknown
speaker
could...
could
the
state
require
a
special
mark
on
your
license
plate?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
it's
very
different.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
it's
very
different.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
statute
requires
you
to
make
the
government's
message
four
times
a
year.
unknown
speaker
but
they...
the
megan's
laws
are
not
all
one
size
and
shape.
i
mean,
some
of
them
have
the
disclaimer
right
on
the
page
saying
we're
not
labeling
this
person
dangerous
and...
and
have
a
chance
for
a
person
to
get
off
it.
here,
because
there's
no
give,
it
does
have
a
punitive
feel.
i
mean,
as
far
as
the
federal
legislation
is
concerned,
a
state
that
tells
the
whole
truth...
is
that...
that
kind
of
law
is
totally
acceptable
within
the
federal
requirement,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't...
at
least
to
say
what...
whether
the
crime
was
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony,
the
disclaimer
certainly
to...
to
say,
now
we
are
not
labeling
this
person
a
forever
sex
offender.
we
are
labeling
this
person
a
convicted--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
thompson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
to
what
extent
do
you...
do
you
mean,
mr.
thompson?
you
said
to
regulate
the
person
himself.
i
mean,
he
is
not
circumscribed
in
his
activities,
is
he?
unknown
speaker
but
not
in
alaska--
unknown
speaker
--in
alaska,
not
in
person,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
how...
how
has
it
been
administered?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
not
part
of--
unknown
speaker
--that's
not...
that's
not
part
of
the
record
here,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
at
least...
at
least--
unknown
speaker
--when
the...
they
have
to
replace
the
photographs
periodically.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
mean,
how
is
that
different?
everybody...
you're
sort
of
turning
this
on
whether
you
have
to
walk
to
the
police
station
or
not.
i
mean,
a
lot
of
people
have
to
go
in
and
report
different
things,
send
in
forms,
give
their
pictures,
even
give
their
fingerprints.
i
would
think
that
the
problem
is
what
happens
to
that
information
later,
that
everybody
in
the
neighborhood
knows
it,
that
they're
likely
to
shun
the
people,
that...
that
it
may
be
too
broad.
i
mean,
is
that...
is
it
really
the
police...
having
to
walk
somewhere
and
write
something
as
opposed
to
sending
in
a
report
that
makes
all
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
someone
who
is
truly
a
dangerous
sex
offender,
who
poses
a
real
risk
to
children
in
that
area?
now,
what
about
that?
are...
is
this
a...
a
scheme
that
is
applied
to
such
a
person
that
poses
constitutional
problems,
do
you
think,
or
does
public
safety
rise
to
the
level
where
it
can
be
responded
to
in
this
fashion?
unknown
speaker
yes.
that's
not
the
question
i
asked
you.
unknown
speaker
i
asked
you
whether,
as
applied
to
someone
who
is
exceedingly
dangerous,
in
your
view
does
the
scheme
survive?
unknown
speaker
maybe
he
deserves
stigmatization
if...
with
the
high
recidivist
rate
under
the
facts
that
justice
o'connor
gave
you.
the
person
is
still
dangerous.
unknown
speaker
if
that's
the
problem--
--but
your--
--how...
how...
this
is...
what
is
your
response
to
justice...
to
the
argument
that
was
made
on
the
other
side?
it
said
simply
this,
that
you're...
you're
raising
an
ex
post
facto
claim.
now,
we
don't
want
to
be
nitpicking
about
this,
but
an
ex
post
facto
claim
is
a
question
of
whether
this
is
punishment,
and
they're
saying
it's
not
seen
as
punishment.
it
wasn't
their
intent
to
punish.
it
was
their
intent
to
inform
so
that
the
thing
won't
happen
again.
that's
not
a
punitive
intent.
and
therefore,
your
claims
about
how
bad
this
is
may
be
right.
and
suppose
i
accept
them.
suppose
i
think
they're
right.
should
i
not,
nonetheless,
wait
until
somebody
raises
a
substantive
due
process
claim?
that
way
you
can
decide
if
the
problem
with
the
statute
is
overly
broad,
if
the
problem
is
that
some
people
should
have
it
applied
to
them
and
others
shouldn't.
all
the
things
that
you
mentioned
would
come
into
play.
but
as
far
as
punitive
intent
is
concerned,
that's
not
the
legislature's--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
that's
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
and
i'd
like
to...
but
tell
me
what
about
the
relation
of
the
substantive
due
process
clause...
about
why
isn't
that
the
better
vehicle
to
make
your
argument?
now,
that's
what
i'd
just
like
to
hear
you
discuss.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that's
true,
but
in
my
mind
rings
a
case,
in
which
i
was
in
dissent,
but
the
majority
has
the
law,
and
that's
hendricks.
if,
after
all,
it's
not
punishment
to
put
a
person
in
a
cell...
and
i
thought
it
was,
but
the
majority
thought
it
wasn't...
why
is
it
punishment,
following
the
law,
to
simply
require
the
person
to
make
reports
four
times
a
year?
unknown
speaker
and
it...
it
required
less
than
putting
the
person
in
what
was,
in
effect,
a
jail
cell.
i'm...
i'm
looking
at
the
precedent
on
ex
post
facto.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
guess
that
one
of
the
problems
i
have
with...
with
your
side
of
this
case
is
that
this
is
public
information
insofar
as
a
conviction
is
concerned.
insofar
as
addresses,
credit
card
companies,
and
driver's
license
bureaus
have
this
stuff
all
the
time.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
the
court
were
to
strike
down
these
laws,
some
private
business
could
have
a
web...
a
web
page,
just
like
credit
card
companies
do.
there
may
be
some
privacy
act
concerns,
but
still,
this
is
truthful
information.
unknown
speaker
it's...
it's
truth
as
far
as
it
goes.
there's
nothing
false
in
the
information
reported.
i
questioned
whether
it
was
the
whole
truth
because
it
has
the
bad
side,
but
none
of
the
good.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
suppose
a
lot
of
credit--
unknown
speaker
--the
credit
reports
are
misleading
too.
maybe
the
person
is
now
very
successful,
and
is
paying
all
their
bills.
you
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
well,
does...
does
any
entity
in
a
society,
a...
a
nursery
school
have
an
interest
in...
in
knowing
the
background
of
their
employees?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
have
an...
they
have
an
interest
in
knowing
that.
that
isn't...
that
isn't
somehow
punitive
or...
or
half
the
truth.
they
make
the...
they
make
the
inference
that
there's...
that
there's
a
hazard
here,
a
risk
they
don't
want
to
take.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that...
that
issue
is
not...
not
before
the
court,
and
if
that's
so,
this...
this
just
shows
that
it's
a
regulatory
scheme
which
has
another
valid
purpose.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
disagree
with...
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
then
when
they
said
it
was
not
a
punitive
intent
on
the
part
of--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
would...
you
would
concede
that
it
is
least
ambiguous
because
the
legislature
said
our
purpose
is
regulatory.
so
you're
not
going
to
say
that's...
that's
incredible.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
a
civil
goal
too,
i--
unknown
speaker
--you
rely
to
some
extent
on
the
placement
in
the
criminal
code
both
that
the
information
about
this
registry
system
has
to
be
part
of
every
criminal
judgment
and
part
of
every
rule
11
colloquy.
unknown
speaker
so
i
thought
it
might
be
fair
for
you
to
say,
well,
it's...
it's
mixed.
it's
ambiguous.
in
some
respects,
it's...
looks
regulatory.
in
other
respects
it
looks
punitive.
i
thought
that's
what
would
you
say
instead
of...
so
we
have
to
look
further.
but
are
you
saying
right
from
the
very
reading
of
this
law,
it
is
necessarily
punitive?
unknown
speaker
would
it
affect--
unknown
speaker
--your
claim
is
an
ex
post
facto
claim,
a
retroactivity
claim.
suppose
this
scheme,
the
alaska
scheme,
did
allow
people...
like
the
parties
here...
to
say,
i'm
no
longer
dangerous.
here's
the
documentation
of
that.
take
me
off
the
list.
would
you
say,
nonetheless,
it's
still
punitive?
are
you
saying
that
even
if
someone
made
no
showing
at
all
of
lack
of
dangerousness,
this
is...
it
would
be
ex
post
facto
and
therefore
must
fall?
unknown
speaker
you...
you
are
asserting
that
doe
i
and
ii
are
people
who
are
no
longer
dangerous.
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
asking
you
about
the
people
in
this
large
category
who
are
still
dangerous,
or
at
least
have
made
no
showing
that
they
are
not
dangerous.
you
would
have
the
same
ex
post
facto
argument
with
respect
to
those
people?
or
does
it
depend,
to
some
extent,
on
the
ability
to
show
that
you
are
not
dangerous?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
legislature
says
we
don't
want
this
to
be
punitive,
therefore
we
will
give
everyone
who
was
a
convicted
sex
offender
an
opportunity
to
show
that
they're
no
longer
dangerous,
and
then
there
will
be
a
determination
made,
yes,
you
are,
no,
you're
not,
would
you
still
be
making
the
ex
post
facto
argument
for
the
people
who
have
not
shown
they're
no
longer
dangerous?
unknown
speaker
why
would
it
be
a--
unknown
speaker
--why
would
it
be
a
closer
call?
why
would
it
be
a
closer
call?
is
everything
that
is
bad
regulation
punishment?
i
mean,
all
that
would
show...
all
you're
claiming
is
that
some
people
who
are
not
dangerous
are...
are
wrongly
covered
by
this
regulatory
measure.
that
still
doesn't
prove
that
the
regulatory
measure
is
punitive.
it
just
shows
that
it's
stupid.
[laughter]
that
doesn't
make
it
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
every
regulatory
measure
that
goes
too
far
is...
is
not
criminal
punishment.
unknown
speaker
that's...
that's...
the
question
justice
ginsburg
started
with
is
every
time...
you
just
replied
to
justice
scalia...
and
what
i
hear
are
words
that
seem
to
apply
with
equal
force
to
a
perfectly-tailored
statute
that
would
catch
only
the
most
dangerous
sex
offenders
who
everyone
agrees
are
virtually
uncontrollable
and
might
repeat
their
offense
many,
many
times.
see,
if
it
applies...
if
the
argument...
the
question
people
are
asking
you...
i'm
simply
repeating
it...
is,
on
your
argument
why
isn't
that
just
as
much
an
ex
post
facto
law?
what
has
it
got
to
do
with
the
matter
that
it's
overly
broad,
et
cetera,
which
sounds
to
me
like
a
substantive
due
process
argument,
not
an
ex
post
facto
argument?
that's
the
same
question.
but
i
would
like
you
to
focus
right
on
it.
unknown
speaker
but
then...
then
you
might--
unknown
speaker
--well,
at
that
point
at
least
there
would
be...
i...
i
assume
your...
your
point
would
be
that
there...
there
is
at
least
a...
a
credible
basis
to
say
that
if
it
covers
only
those
who
are
affirmatively
shown
to
be
dangerous,
the
object
is
simply
to
apprise
the
public
to
who
is
dangerous,
and
that
doesn't
sound
very
punitive.
but
if
there
is
no
attempt
to
weed
out
the
dangerous
from
the
non-dangerous,
then
the
claim
that
the
object
is
simply
to
apprise
the
public
of
who
is
dangerous
is
not
so
credible.
i
mean,
isn't...
isn't--
unknown
speaker
--that
one
of
your
points?
if
that's
your
point,
then
how
do
you
respond
to
their
argument
which
is
that
that's
just
too
tough
to
do?
we
don't
know
enough
about
it.
it...
it
would
invite
endless
hearings.
it
would
be
impossible
to
administer
this
statute.
i'm
not
making
the
argument.
i'm
repeating
it--
unknown
speaker
--for
you
to
respond
to.
unknown
speaker
how
many
megan's
laws
have
that
regime?
i...
i
understand
that
some
of
them
do.
some
of
them
are
like
alaska.
they
say
this
is
based
solely
on
your
past
conviction.
others
say
you
have
an
opportunity
to
show
that
you're
no
longer
dangerous.
what...
in...
in
the
range
of
megan's
laws
that
all
the
states
have,
how
many
treat
this
as
something
you
can
get
out
of
by
showing
you're
not
dangerous?
unknown
speaker
what's
wrong
about--
unknown
speaker
--what's
wrong
about
warning
the
public
about
who
may
be
dangerous?
you...
you
seem
to
say
that
it's
only...
it's
only
okay
if
the
state
warns
the
public
about
who
is
dangerous.
what's
wrong
about
warning
the
public
about
who
may
be
dangerous?
let
the
public
make...
you
know,
the
later...
later
determination.
unknown
speaker
what
is
irrational
or
unconstitutional
about
warning
the
public
about
a
category
of
people
who
may
be
dangerous
as
to
whom...
as
the
entire
category
of
whom,
there's
more
likely
to
be
danger
than...
than
with
respect
to
other
people?
where
is
it
written
that
you
can
only
warn
the
public
about
those
whom
you
have...
are
sure
are
dangerous?
unknown
speaker
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
if
it
helps
you
or
hurts
you.
it...
it
indicates
that...
that
the
most
distressing
and
damaging
fact
that
you
have...
that
you
have
the
conviction
is
available
to
the
public
anyway.
and
this
is
just
a
regulatory
scheme
to...
to
make
that
information
more
clear
as
to
how
many
people
are
in
the
community
have
suffered
that
conviction.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
take
it
under
the
registration
form
we're
talking
about,
that
the
date
of
the
conviction
is
there,
and
the...
the
citizen
can
make
up
his
or
her
own
mind
as
to
whether
the
conviction
was
so
long
ago
that
they're
no
longer
worried
about
it.
unknown
speaker
you
want...
you
want
more
information
on
this
form?
unknown
speaker
what...
what
if
the
state
simply
decided
we're
going
to
put
on
the
internet,
the
same
way
that
alaska
does
here,
the
names
of
all
the
people
who
had
criminal
convictions
of
any
sort
without
any
more
information
in...
in
the
last
5
years?
now,
if
they
applied
that
to
people
who
were
convicted
after
they
passed
it,
would
that
be
ex
post
facto?
unknown
speaker
if
it
had
the
same
stigmatizing
effect,
why
would
your
answer
be
different?
why...
why
would
it
not
be
ex
post
facto
in
that
case,
whereas
it
is
in
this?
i'm
not
sure
what
line
you're
drawing.
unknown
speaker
no.
i...
i
realize
that,
but
you
said
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
that
there
would
be
the
same...
in
your
judgment,
there
would
be
the
same
stigmatizing
effect
if
they
put
every
criminal
conviction
on...
on
the
internet.
and
if...
if
the
stigmatizing
effect
would
be
the
same
and
the
information
would
be
just
as
readily
available,
why
would
your
answer
be
different,
that
that
would
not
be
ex
post
facto
whereas
this
is?
that
would
not
be
punitive.
this
is
punitive.
unknown
speaker
well,
what--
unknown
speaker
--you're
tapping
everything,
the
register
and--
unknown
speaker
--so
you
would
say
even
just
the
requirement
that
they
register,
even
if
it's
just
circulated
to
law
enforcement
people,
that's
impermissibly
retroactive
as
well.
so
there
can
be...
is
there
any
scheme
for
keeping
track
of
ex-offenders
that
would
pass
the
ex
post
facto
test
in
your
judgment,
or
is
it
just
they've
served
their
time,
they've
done
whatever,
parole
is
given
to
them,
and
that's
it?
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
know
of
any
precedent...
perhaps
you
can
tell
us
if
there
is...
from
this
court
saying
that
a
measure
with
a
declared
regulatory
purpose
is,
nonetheless,
impermissibly
retroactive.
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
so
holds.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
to
comment
on...
on
one
thing--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
sorry.
one...
one
thing
that
makes
it
more
difficult
perhaps
than
it
might
be
to
see
your
side
of
the
argument...
go
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
what
if
they
put
every
criminal
conviction
on
the
internet?
well,
there's
one
difference
between
the
situation
that
would
obtain
then
and
the
situation
that...
that
you're
objecting
to
here.
that
is,
that
there
is
not
the
same
high
recidivism
rate
for
crimes
generally
that
there
is,
apparently
undisputedly,
for
sex
crimes
in
the
state
of
alaska.
and
therefore,
when
you
earlier
made
the
argument
that
there
is
something
very...
something
less
than
credible
in
the
state's
claim
that
it's
merely
trying
to
inform
the
public
when,
in
fact,
it
makes
no
differentiation
between
current
dangerousness
and
un-current
dangerousness,
the
answer
is
there
is...
or
an
answer
is...
there
is
a
very
high
recidivism
rate,
and
that
high
recidivism
rate
does
support
the
claim
that
there
is
something
that...
that
it
is
credible
to
say
that
by
publishing
this
information,
we
are
simply
trying
to
inform
people
of
a
probability
of
dangerousness,
leaving
them
to
do
what
they
want.
what
is...
is
there
any...
do
you
have
any
response
to
this
claim
that
the
high
recidivism
rate
itself
supports
the
argument
that,
in
fact,
this
is
nothing
but
a
safety
information
kind
of
measure,
whereas
broadcasting
all
criminal
convictions
would
not
be
justified
as
having
a
good
fit
between
the
object
and
what
the
state
was
doing?
do
you
have
any
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
dispute
the
state's
recidivism
figure,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
they're
making
specific...
they're
making
specific
claims.
they...
they
set
out
specific
percentages
with
respect
to
alaska.
are
you
disputing
those
figures
or
not?
unknown
speaker
you
do.
all
right.
unknown
speaker
that's...
that's
the
trouble.
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
take
into
account
that
the
degree
of
harm,
if
you
make
a
mistake?
that
is,
suppose
somebody
is
a
pickpocket
and
you
have
a
list
and
say,
pickpockets
have
to
register,
the
same
thing
as
here.
so
if
you
make
a
mistake
about
a
pickpocket,
somebody
is
out
of
some
change.
if
you
make
a
mistake
here
about
a
person's
dangerousness,
the
consequences
could
be
very
grave.
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
all
right
to
have
the
person
report
every
90
days
to
have
a
determination
of
present
dangerousness?
unknown
speaker
i'm
interested
in
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
be
all
right?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
way
out.
unknown
speaker
and
one
of
your
complaints
is
this
system
provides
no
way
out.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
thompson.
mr.
roberts,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
is
the
effects
test
used
to
impeach
the
finding
that
the
legislature
had
a
regulatory
intent?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
thought
that
it
was
an
additional
step
that
you
had
to
take
if
you...
even
if
you
find
the
legislature
had
the...
the
permitted
intent.
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
the
legislature
has
a
pure
intent,
it
can
have
as
burdensome
a
regulation
as
it
wants
based
on
previous
criminal
convictions?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
saying...
you're
saying
if
it's...
it
wouldn't
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause
in
your
view.
it
might
violate
some
other
clause
like
the
substantive
due
process.
