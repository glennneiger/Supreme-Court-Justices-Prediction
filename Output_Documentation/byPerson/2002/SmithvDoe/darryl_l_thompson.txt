mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
the
alaska
sex
offender
registration
act
imposes
punishment
because
it
possesses
three
features
which
are
classically
considered
to
be
punishment,
and
not
like
any
other
civil
or
regulatory
measure
this
court
has
seen
before.
first
of
all,
the
sanction
attaches
automatically
and
inescapably
solely
on
a
basis
of
a
prior
conviction,
without
any
determination
of
present
dangerousness
at
all.
secondly,
the
sanction
is
a
pervasive
regulation
of
the
person
themselves.
there
is
no
attempt
to
try
to
regulate
an
activity
or
a
profession
here.
it's
a
regulation
of
the
person
himself.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
he
has
to
report
four
times
a
year.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
just
like
they
do
on
probation.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
well,
we
respectfully
disagree
with
mr.
roberts'
characterization
of
the
statute.
the
statute
gives
unfettered
discretion
to
the
department
of
public
safety...
the
police...
to
administer
it
in
a
way
that
it
deems
appropriate.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
regulatorily
they
have
done
it
by
mail.
but
i
can
cite
you
instances,
with
affidavits
in
a
parallel
case,
of
people
that
were
mandated
to
report
to
the
police.
they
can
do
it
and--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--have
the
discretion
to
do
it.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
that
is
not
part
of
the
record
here.
but
they
have--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--the
unfettered
discretion
by
the
pure
statutory
language.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
they
do,
and...
and
they're
required
to...
on
their
quarterly
report
to
report
any
changes
in
their
physical
characteristics,
they
gain
weight,
they
grow
gray
hair,
they
get
lasix
surgery,
don't
have
glasses,
grow
a
beard,
get
fat.
whatever
it
is,
they've
got
to
report
that
information.
and
you
know
that's
going
to
be
a
triggering
event.
i
mean,
if
they
look
different,
the
police
are
going
to
have
them
come
back
in
and
get
a
new
photograph--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--no.
i
mean,
what
i...
what
i...
the
third
characteristic
is...
is
the
stigmatizing
characteristic,
which
i
want
to...
want
to
talk
about
here.
but
it's
not
just--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--well,
unlike
the...
the
kansas
situation,
kansas
v.
hendricks,
there's
no
effort
to
weed
out
those
who
are
dangerous
from
those
who
are
not.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
i
apologize.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
well,
no.
it's
still
an
evasive
regulation
of
the
individual
just
like
probation
and
it's
still
a
stigmatizing
system
that
labels
them
as
dangerous.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
but
not
all
of
them
are.
and
that's
the
problem
with
this
statute.
it
applies
to
those
people
that
are
demonstrably
not
dangerous.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
well,
we...
i'm
sorry.
we
disagree--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--yes.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
i
mean,
it
certainly
is
a
vehicle,
you
know,
to
talk
about
whether
or
not
it's
narrowly
tailored
to...
to
a
specific
regulatory
goal.
i
think
that
is
a
proper
challenge,
and
it
was
challenged
at
the
lower
court
level.
but
we're
here
today
on
an
ex
post
facto
question
before
the
court,
and
the
question
is,
is
it
punishment,
or
is
it
not?
and
we...
we
respectfully
disagree
that
this
is
intended
to
be
purely
a
regulatory
measure.
and
we
disagree
because
the
state's
sole
reliance
is
on
the
language
found
in
the
preamble
of
the
statute,
that
it's
designed
to
protect
the
public.
that's
one
of
the
penal
goals
under
the
constitution
in
the
state
of
alaska
for
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
well,
it
is...
it
is...
probation
requires
the
exact
same
thing,
and
that's
our
point.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
certainly.
and...
and...
and
you
know,
hendricks
and
salerno
present
the
types
of
cases
that
are
steeped
in
the
pedigree
of
this
court
looking
to
the
need
to
protect
the
public
from
those
people
that
are
actively
dangerous
now,
and
that's
why
it
was
important
in
hendricks
that
there
was,
in
fact,
those
protections
afforded
to
the
individual.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
happen
automatically
that
hendricks
was
going
to
be
put
in
jail.
there
had
to
have
been
a
jury
trial,
or
trial
by
a
judge
with
a
preponderance
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
he's
allowed
an
annual
review.
he
can
petition
at
any
time.
the
secretary,
at
his
own
discretion,
can
remove
that
restriction.
so
the
duration
of
that
is
solely
limited
and...
and
looks
to
the
purpose
to
protect
the
people
from
those...
the
public
from
those
people
that
are
dangerous.
none
of
those
protections
are
here.
in
fact,
this
is
a
wide-sweeping
statute
that
takes
everybody
in.
and...
and
we
have
to
look--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--it's
not
truthful
information,
and
respectfully,
i...
i
agree
with
what
justice
ginsburg
was
saying
earlier.
i
mean,
it's...
it's
false--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--it's
sort
of
the
sin
of
omission,
particularly
when
we
look...
we
look
to--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--well,
and...
and
it
goes
further
than
that.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
but
the
legislatures
made
it
clear
that
they
are
telling
the
public
that
these
people
weren't
just
someone
who
once
had
a
conviction.
they're
telling
the
public
that
these
people
are
actively
dangerous
now,
presently
dangerous
to
be
actively
avoided.
and
how
do
they
do
that?
if
you
know
someone
is
on
the
registry...
and
the
idea
being
make
my
own
informed
choice.
now
that
i
know
this
information,
get
some
more
information.
and
if
you
know
they're
on
the
registry
and
you
get
the
rest
of
that
information,
you
know
they're
cured,
you
know
they've
been
great--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--readily
available,
and
it
has
always
been
available
and
it
was
available
before
the
statute.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
what
i
was
getting
at
earlier
was...
is
that
the
state
of
alaska
makes
it
a
crime,
felony
child
endangerment,
if
you
leave
your
kid
alone
with
someone
who's
on
the
registry.
and
it
doesn't
matter
that
that
person
is
safe.
it
doesn't
matter
that
that
person
is
not
dangerous.
so
the
state
is
telling
you
that
they
are
to
be
avoided.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
we
disagree.
what
we
think
that
demonstrates
is
that
it's
a
clear
proclamation
because
it
came
at
the
same
time
as
the
amendments
in
'97,
a
clear
proclamation
of
a
legislative
intent
to
tell
the
public
that
everyone
on
that
registry
is
currently,
presently
dangerous.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
yes,
we
do
disagree
with
that
and
we...
we
briefed
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
well,
the
legislature
never
said
it
was
a
civil
regulatory
measure.
what
the
legislators
said
and
what
their
sole
reliance
on
intent
is,
is
in
the
preamble
where
it
says
it
serves
to
protect
the
public.
and...
and
it's
clear
that
protection
of
the
public
in...
in
salerno
was...
was
viewed
as
a
proper
regulatory
goal,
but
in...
in
brown
it's
also
viewed
as
a
proper
criminal
goal.
and
in
alaska,
it's
the
goal...
one
of
the
stated
goals
under
article
i,
section
12
of
the
penal
administration...
it
is
a
criminal
goal
to
protect
the
public.
so
i
don't
think
that...
that's...
that's--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--it
is
a
civil
goal
too.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
that's...
that's
true.
the
legislature,
you
know,
in
our
view
considered
it
such
an
important
component
and
consequence
of
any
criminal
conviction,
that
in
fact,
that's
the
only
information
that
a
judge
has
to
give
to
someone
convicted
of
a
sex
offense
in
writing.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
we
do
believe
that.
i
mean,
it
was
intended,
again,
to
protect
the
public,
but
when
you
look
to
a
law
that's...
that's
geared
directly
at
individuals
or
groups
of
individuals
and
not
set
out
to
regulate
any
kind
of
activities,
you
know,
that
is
an
intent
in
our
view
to...
to
punish--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--solely
based
upon
a
prior
conviction.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
if
i...
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--yes.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
first
of
all,
i
think
we
would...
we
would
take
the
position
that
in
the
absence
of
any
criteria
of
actual
present
dangerousness
demonstrates
that...
that
the
legislature
is
aimed
at
the
prior
conviction
and
tacking
on
certain
responsibilities
to
the
prior
conviction
as
opposed
to
really
trying
to
fit
the
goal
here
of
protecting
the
public
from
dangerous
people.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
i
think
it
would
certainly
be
a
closer
call,
and--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--and
my
clients
would
certainly
invite
that
hearing.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
it
is
if
it
looks
just
like
probation
and
has
the
same
consequences
as
probation
because
probation
is
historically--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--well,
i
apparently
have
not
been
doing
a
very
good
job
of
it,
but
i'll
try.
when
we
look
to
whether
or
not
the
statute
imposes
a
punishment,
i
think
it's
important
that
we
look
to
whether
or
not
it...
it's...
fits
with
the
umbrella
things
which
have
historically
considered
to
be
punishment.
and
that's
one
of
our
starting
points,
and
that's
why
i
keep
going
back
to
the
concept
of
probation
and
parole
because
historically
there's
no
dispute
that
probation
is
a
depravation
of
liberty.
not...
it's
not
like
going
to
jail,
but
it's
a
depravation
of
liberty.
and...
and
it's
been
considered
as
punishment,
and
that's
what
this
thing
does
to
people.
now,
if
it
was
a
perfectly-tailored...
such
that
it
could
weed
out
the
dangerous
from
the
non-dangerous...
well,
we
would
invite
that
because
my
clients
wouldn't
be
here
today.
my
client
has
been
determined,
you
know,
to
be
not
dangerous
by
a
superior
court
family
judge.
but
would
it
still
be
punishment?
i
think
we'd
have
to
look
at
the...
a
little
bit
closer
at
it.
but,
you
know,
if
there's
a
closer
nexus
between
the
public
purpose
and
there...
there
is
a
weeding
out,
maybe
it
wouldn't
be
punishment
because
maybe
it's...
it's
escapable,
it...
it's--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--at
that
point,
it's
not
regulating
him
for
life.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
that
is
my
point.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
right.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
i
guess
that
would
make
the...
the
due
process
hearing
or
the...
the
hearing
that
is
established
in...
in
hendricks,
and
the
hearing
that's
established
in
salerno
futile
as
well.
i
mean,
judges
are
called
upon
every
day
to
make
determinations
as
to
whether
or
not
people
are
presently
dangerous.
they
do
it
every
day
in
the
context
of
evaluating
the
sentencing
criteria
in
the
state
of
alaska.
it's
called
the
chaney
criteria.
they
have
to
look
to
whether
or
not
someone
poses
a
risk
to
the
community.
that's
what
they
have
to
do
in--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--you
know,
i
don't
have
a...
a
number
for
you.
i
can't
tell
you
if
it's
23
states
or
not.
i
don't...
i'm
sorry.
i
don't--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--i
don't
know
that.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
i
guess
we
get
down
to
this
who
determines
who
they're...
who
may
be
dangerous
or
not.
i
mean,
what...
what's
the
criteria
for
that?
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
part
of
the
problem
with
the
statute,
it's
not
just
a
warning
of
the
public.
i
mean,
it...
it's...
there
are
really
various
components.
it's
not
just
a
notification
statute.
i
mean,
you
know,
the
public
right
now
has
access
to...
through
another
statute
that
we
have...
to
offender
information.
all
they've
got
to
do
is
request.
and
this
is
an
unnecessary
statute
in...
in
one
sense.
does
it
broadcast
it
on
the
internet?
no.
but
the
same
information
is
available,
and
it's
information
that's
available
not
just
going
to
a
courthouse,
but
you
can
actually
request
the
state
for
that
information.
and...
and
for
some
people,
information
may
be
limited.
there
are
some
restrictions.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
that
the
information
as
to
serious
offenses
that
are
beyond
10
years
is
limited.
there's
some
sense
of
limitation,
some
sense
of
it's
been
a
long
time.
so
that
information
is
limited
to
those
people
that
have
a
need
to
know,
like
for
example,
the
day
care
providers
and
the
teachers
and...
and
schools
who
want
to
know--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--they
really
don't
have
the
right
kind
of
information
to
make
that
decision.
i
mean,
what
they
have
is
only
the
conviction--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--absolutely
not.
[laughter]
the...
you
know,
i
don't.
i
don't
want
more
information.
and
the...
the
tribunal
that
should
be
making
the
determination
of
dangerousness
really
ought
to
be
in
a
thoughtful,
rational
process
in
front
of
a...
of
a
judge.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
i
don't
know
that
it
would.
it
would
probably
have
the
same
stigmatizing
effect.
i
mean,
i
just...
i
want
to
share
with
you
the
state
has
already
done
that
in
the
state
of
alaska.
you
can
get
information
as
to
anyone
in
the
state
of
alaska
by
a
click
of
a
mouse
by
going
on
the
internet,
if
their
convictions
were
in
the
state
of
alaska.
that
information
is
already
available.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
well,
the
stigmatizing
effect
here
is
that
these
people
are
being
currently
labeled
as...
as
sex
offenders.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
well,
perhaps
it
would,
but
you
know,
our
analysis
of
this
ex
post
facto
argument
is
really
a
composite
of
a
variety
of
components
of
the
statute
and
not
simply
the
public
notification
provision.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
it's
certainly
an
important
part.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
yes.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
you
know,
if...
if
the
requirements
of
the
individual
subject
to
the
registration
requirements
alone
were
not
as
onerous
as
here
where
they
have
to
report
on
every
90
days
all
kinds
of
personal
information,
and
if
they
don't,
then
they're
going
to
be...
go...
go
to
jail,
it
may
be
a
closer
call.
i
mean,
there
was
the...
the
history
of
the
felony
registrations,
but
they've
never
really
been
approved
by
this
court
as
somehow
being
a
proper
regulatory
measure.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
nothing
is
jumping
out
at
me
either.
[laughter]
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
but
these
are
unique
statutes.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
i
certainly
don't
profess
to
be
an
expert
on
the
statistical
recidivist
rates.
i
think
that
is--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--well,
actually
vis-a-vis
the
brief
that
was
submitted
by
massachusetts
as
an
amici
in
this,
sets
forth
a
very
different
pattern
of
recidivist
rates.
i
mean,
when
we
say
recidivist
rates,
are
we
talking
about
repeat
sex
offenses?
are
we
talking
about
repeated
crimes?
i
mean,
there
are
all
different
ways
in
which--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--we
do.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
we
do,
but
i
don't
think
we
did
it
directly
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
other...
other
briefs--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--do.
you
know,
even
if
we
accept--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--and
there's
a
solution
to
that,
and
the
solution
is
have...
is
to
look
to
the
individualized
determination
of
the
person's
present
dangerousness.
and,
you
know,
in
the
mckune
case,
the--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--it
certainly
wouldn't
be
necessary
for
john
doe
i.
he's
already
had
a
determination
that
he's
not
dangerous
by
a
court.
i
don't
know
why
you'd
have
to
continue
to
redo
that.
i
mean,
the
idea
is
you
get
progressively--
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
--no,
it
wouldn't
be
all
right.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
no,
not
every
90
days.
that's...
that's
awfully
burdensome
to
require
someone
not
just
to
come
into
the
police
station
or
fill
out
a
written
form,
but
to
require
someone...
as
a
direct
consequence
of
a
prior
conviction,
to
require
someone
to
come
and...
and
be
subject
every
90
days
to
a
judicial
scrutiny
as
to
whether
or
not
you're
still
dangerous,
that
seems
to
be
a
pretty
big
disability.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
it
is
a
way
out.
mr.
darryl
l.
thompson
that's
absolutely
correct.
it
is
a
way
out.
the
alaska
sex
offender
registration
act
really
is
nothing
other
than
tacking
on...
for
my
clients...
a
lifetime
of
probation,
a
lifetime
of
community
supervision,
having
to
report
to
the
police...
my
time
is
up.
