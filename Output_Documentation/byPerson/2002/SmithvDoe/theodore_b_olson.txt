mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
and
the
legislatures
of
50
states
have
agreed
that
citizens
should
have
access
to
truthful
information
concerning
the
identity
and
location
of
convicted
sex
offenders.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
agree
with
the
characterization
of
this
as
a
megaphone.
what
i...
what
i
would
characterize
it
instead
of
saying
it
is
the
least
intrusive,
most
passive
way
to
provide
information
that
is
already
available
to
citizens,
and
can
be
obtained
by
citizens,
but
to
make
it
more
accessible
to
them
because
the
people
have
decided
that
they
want
this
information.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
but
it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
it's...
but
it's
minimally
passive
and...
and
minimally--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
justice
kennedy,
we
have
to
register
to
vote.
we
have
to
register
to
marry.
we
have
to
register
to
get
a
driver's
license.
we
have
to
disclose
our
homes
when
we
buy
a
car,
when
we
get
a
divorce,
when
we
fill
out
a
census
form.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the...
that
is
a
separate
question.
i'm...
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
burden
of
registration
or
of
keeping
information
current
is
a
minimally
intrusive
burden.
now
with
respect
to
the
question
of
shame,
that
arises,
to
the
extent
that
it
exists
at
all,
from
the
conviction
of
violating
a
sex
offense.
there
is
due
process
in
connection
with
that...
that...
to
the
extent
that
process
is
due...
and
we'll
get
to
that
i
know
in
the
subsequent
case,
but--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
but
that...
that
is
true
of
many
regulatory
measures.
you
can
lose
your
right
to
practice
in
the
securities
field...
and
that's
been
held...
because
of
a
conviction
or
to
practice
banking
or
the
right
to
vote.
there
are
other
consequences.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
don't...
i...
i
don't...
the
court
has
never
addressed
that
question,
but
the
court
has
held
that
after
the
fact,
it
can...
the...
the
legislature
can
prevent
those
persons
from
practicing
that
profession,
including
the
practice
of
medicine,
being
a
fund
raiser
for
a
union,
losing
the
right
to
vote.
the
fact
that
this...
what
the...
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the...
well,
the
fact
of
registration
and
disclosure
relates
to
the
conviction
of
a
sex
offense.
the
public
in
50
states
and
the
legislature
and
congress
have
determined
in
response
to
the
requests
of
the
people...
as
mr.
roberts
said,
the
test,
according
to
this
court's
jurisprudence,
is
the
intent.
the
intent
here
is
not
to
punish.
the
intent
is
to
respond
to
citizens
who
have--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
this
court
has
said
that
only...
you
would
go
beyond
that
only
if
the
evidence
was
the
clearest
proof,
unmistakable
evidence
that
the
intent
or
effect
was
punitive
as
opposed
to
regulatory.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
affirmative
restraint
on
motion.
there
is
no
confinement.
there
is
no
restriction
on
travel
or
employment
or
recreation,
no
obligation
to
submit
to
searches,
intrusive
supervision
or
questioning.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
empirical
evidence
is
not
great
that
that
is
indeed
a
significant
statistical
problem,
but
the
problem,
to
the
extent
that
it
may
exist,
results
from
the
conviction
of
a...
of
an...
of
an
offense--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--about
which
an
employer
may
want
to
know.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
to
apply
the
seven...
to
the
extent
that
the
court
would
apply
the
kennedy
mendoza-martinez
factors,
there
is
no
affirmative
disability
or
restraint.
registration
or
publication
has
never
been
considered
historically
as
punishment.
the...
the...
there
is
a
regulatory
purpose.
the...
even
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
and
perhaps
mr.
roberts
does.
but
what
this
is...
and
i
think
this
is
a
proper
way
to
think
of
this
statute...
in
connection
with
a
class
of
offenses,
where
the...
where
the
rate
of
recidivism
is
significantly
higher...
as
this
court
has
held
very
recently...
than
any
other
crime,
people
are
asking
their
government
please
allow
us
to
know
when
we
have
someone
in
our
neighborhood.
when
we...
when
we're
hiring
a
new--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
i...
well,
i
don't
know,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
would
say
that
would
be
considerably
different
than
what's
here
because
that
would--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i...
i
respectfully
submit
that
it's
a
great
deal
different.
that
mark
on
your
license
plate,
or
mark
on
your
forehead
would
go
wherever
you
would
go.
it
would
require
you
to
carry
the
government's
message
rather
than
the
government
supplying
the
message.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
only...
it
doesn't
require
you
to
make
the
government's
message
four
times
a
year.
the
government's
message,
i
respectfully
submit,
is
made
when
a
citizen
submits
an
inquiry
to
the
state
through
the
internet
listing.
all...
it
is
required
four
times
a
year
is
to
advise
the
government
of
a
current
location
or
current
information
so
that
the
information
on
the
registry
is
accurate
and...
and
up-to-date.
this
is
information
that
citizens
have
requested
of
their
government.
their
government
has
the
information
of
people
who
have
committed
certain
types
of
crimes,
who
society
has
perceived
as
particularly
dangerous.
it's
a
self-protective
mechanism.
the...
not
only
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it...
it
would
seem
to...
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
yes,
it
would
because
the
federal
statute
simply
prescribes
a
floor.
it's
going
to
be
virtually
impossible
and
quite
burdensome
for
the
state
to
supply
what
you
suggest
would
be
complete
information
about
any
individual.
what
the
parents
and
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
and
that
is
all
that
the
registry
does,
and
i
submit
that
to
the
extent
that
your
question
goes
to
any
of
the
seven
kennedy
mendoza-martinez
factors,
it's
excessiveness
is...
on...
on
the
scale.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
i
would
submit
that
this
registry
and
this
information,
providing
truthful,
public
record,
readily
accessible
information
is...
is
minimal.
