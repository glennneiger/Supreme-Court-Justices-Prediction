the
alaska
sex
offender
registration
act
requires
convicted
sex
offenders
to
register
with
law
enforcement
authorities.
we
must
decide
if
the
act
is
retroactive
punishment
that
is
prohibited
by
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
neither
states
nor
the
federal
government
can
enact
an
ex
post
facto
law.
the
alaska
law
requires
any
sex
offender
present
in
the
state
to
register
and
provide
his
name,
address,
place
of
employment,
and
other
information
even
if
the
offense
was
out
of
state
if
the
offender
moves
to
alaska,
the
offender
is
required
to
register.
some
of
the
information
is
kept
confidential
but
most
is
made
available
to
the
public.
now,
both
of
these
respondents
were
convicted
of
the
sexual
abuse
to
the
minor
which
is
an
aggravated
sex
offense
in
the
state
of
alaska.
they
challenge
the
act's
retroactive
application
as
unconstitutional.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
and
invalidated
the
statute
as
to
them.
we
granted
certiorari.
the
framework
for
our
ex
post
facto
inquiry
is
well
established.
first,
the
court
must
ascertain
whether
the
legislature
meant
to
enact
a
civil
regulatory
scheme;
second,
even
if
that
intent
is
present,
we
examine
whether
the
act
is
so
punitive
in
effect
as
to
negate
the
state's
intention
to
deem
it
civil.
in
ascertaining
the
legislative
intent,
we
consider
the
statute's
text
and
structure,
here
the
statute
sets
forth
the
legislative
findings
that
sex
offenders
pose
a
high
risk
of
reoffending
that
protecting
the
public
from
sex
offenders
is
the
law's
primary
interest,
and
that
release
of
certain
information
about
sex
offenders
will
assist
the
public
safety.
we
have
held
in
an
imposition
of
restrictive
measures
on
sex
offenders
that
judged
to
be
dangerous
is
a
legitimate,
non-punitive
governmental
objective
and
the
text
of
the
statute
suggest
us
that
in
this
case,
the
legislator
sought
to
create
a
civil
scheme
designed
to
protect
the
public
from
harm.
also,
probative
of
the
legislature's
intent
is
the
manner
of
the
statute's
codification.
the
notification
provisions
of
the
act
are
codified
in
alaska's
health
safety
and
housing
code.
this
confirms
our
conclusion
that
the
statute
was
inteded
as
a
non-punitive
regulatory
measure.
on
the
other
hand,
the
act's
registration
provisions
are
codified
in
the
state's
criminal
procedure
code
and
this
might
seem
to
point
in
the
opposite
direction.
the
location
and
labels
of
the
statutory
provision
do
not
however
by
themselves
transform
a
civil
remedy
into
a
criminal
one
and
the
partial
codification
of
the
act
in
the
state's
criminal
procedure
code
does
not
negate
our
conclusion
that
this
is
a
civil,
not
a
criminal
scheme.
in
analyzing
the
effects
of
the
act,
we
first
consider
whether
in
our
nation's
history
and
traditions
the
regulatory
scheme
has
been
regarded
as
punishment.
sex
offenders
registration
statutes
are
fairly
recent
origin.
any
initial
resemblance
to
the
shaming
punishments
of
the
colonial
period
is
misleading.
in
contrast
to
those
punishments,
the
act's
stigma
results
not
from
public
display
for
ridicule,
but
from
the
dissemination
of
accurate
information
about
a
criminal
record,
most
of
which
is
already
public.
second,
the
act
does
not
subject
respondent's
to
an
affirmative
disability
or
restraint.
the
act
does
not
require
the
updates
to
be
made
in
person.
the
registration
system
does
not
resemble
probation
or
supervise
release
because
the
registrants
are
free
to
move
where
they
wish
and
to
live
and
work
with
other
citizens
with
no
supervision
or
need
for
prior
permission
from
authorities.
third,
the
act
does
not
promote
the
traditional
aims
of
punishment.
the
fact
that
it
might
deter
future
crimes
is
not
as
positive
as
any
number
of
regulatory
programs
might
deter
crime
without
imposing
punishment.
the
act's
registration
obligations
are
not
retributive.
fourth,
the
act
has
a
rational
connection
to
a
legitimate
non-punitive
purpose
of
public
safety
which
is
advanced
by
alerting
the
public
to
the
risk
of
sex
offenders
in
their
community.
fifth,
the
regulation
is
not
excessive
with
respect
to
its
non-punitive
purpose.
alaska
may
legislate
with
respect
to
convicted
sex
offenders
as
a
class
rather
than
require
individual
determination
of
their
dangerousness,
because
the
conviction
for
a
sex
offense
provides
evidence
of
substantial
risk
of
recidivism.
why
dissemination
is
easy
accessibility
of
the
offender
information
does
not
render
the
act
excessive
given
the
general
mobility
of
our
population
and
the
passive
nature
of
the
notification
system.
the
regulatory
means
chosen
are
reasonable
in
light
of
the
non-punitive
objective.
respondents
cannot
show,
much
less
by
the
clearest
proof
which
is
what
our
precedents
require
that
the
effects
of
the
act
negate
the
state's
intention
to
establish
a
civil
regulatory
scheme.
the
act
is
non-punitive
and
its
retroactive
application
does
not
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded.
