justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
wrong?
i
mean,
this
money
is
there
to
pay
for
the
child's
care
and
maintenance.
if
the
grandmother
won't
pay
it,
why
couldn't
the
state
go
to
hhs
and
say,
appoint
us?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
wouldn't
they
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
shouldn't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
see.
so
there's
a
particular...
a
particular
state
law--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
stopped
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
that's
what
creates
the
problem
because
if
you
have
a
state
law
and
the
grandmother
just
says,
no,
i'm
not
going
to
pay
this
money,
which
i
would
have
thought
was
earmarked
for
that
purpose,
pretty
much,
and
they
won't
do
it,
and
then
you
say,
okay,
appoint
us,
and
the
state
says,
no,
we...
we
cannot
appoint
ourselves,
and
then
you
say
to
the
grandmother,
well,
pay
us,
well,
then
you
really
are
a
creditor
in
respect
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you're
in
an
anomalous
situation,
aren't
you?
i
mean,
here...
here
you
have...
if
you...
if
you...
you're
a
creditor
in
respect
to
the
grandmother
who
won't
pay.
i...
i
don't
quite
see
how
to
work
it
out.
there's
going
to
be
an
anomaly
no
matter
what
you
do.
you're
a
creditor
in
respect
to
the
grandmother,
so
you
can't
force
the
parents
to
pay.
and
you
can't
go
and
ask
hhs
to
appoint
you
because
of
the
state
law.
and
then
there
you
are
in
those
instances
where
you
did
manage
to
get
yourself
appointed,
and
you're
now
trying
to
reach
a
different
result
than
would
be
there
in
the
other
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
the
same
thing
when
you
have
an
ez
pass
if
you
go
through
the
tolls?
one
of
the
kids
buys
an
ez
pass
and
unfortunately
it
shows
up
on
his
credit
card
a
month
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
they
had
to
put
up
a
deposit,
for
example,
the
state
couldn't
pay
for
the
ez
pass.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
bother
you
that
the
social--
--how
would
you
square
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--know
how
you
square
that
position
with
a
statute
that
seems
aimed
at
giving
children
this
money
so
they
can
pay
for
room
and
board
and
meet
their
basic
subsistence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you've
lost
me
a
long
time
ago
because
i
have
a
sort
of
basic
question.
it
seems
to
me
if
a
mother
or
somebody
in
the
family
who
is
the
recipient
of
this
extra
money
coming
in
from
the
ssi
can
use
it,
has
the
right
to
use
it
to
pay
a
bill
that
the
child
ran
up
for
some
food
or
from
shelter
or,
for
that
matter,
ez
pass
or
tuition...
and
i...
i
gather
they
have
at
least
the
right
to
do
that
if
they
want
to
pay
those
bills.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
think
it's
the
right
thing
to
do,
and
so
they...
yes,
they
think
it's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
all
right.
let's...
let's
imagine
that
doing
what
you
think
is
right
for
the
child
is
in
the
child's
best
interest.
and
therefore
you
do
the
right
thing
which
is
to
pay
the
bills
for
food,
shelter,
tuition,
and
whatever
that
the
child
ran
up.
now,
assuming
that
that's
okay,
why
can't
the
state
do
exactly
the
same
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now
i
got
your
point.
--that
is
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
my
question
would
be
they're
the
agency.
they
know
what
congress
had
in
mind.
a
naive
reading
would
say
congress
had
in
mind
pay
these
bills
for
food
and
shelter,
but
they
know
it.
they're
the
experts.
they
know
their
own
regs,
and
they
come
in
and
tell
you
your
reading
of
this
is
totally
wrong.
of
course,
congress
wanted
guardians,
whether
they're
states
or
not
states,
to
pay
bills
for
food
and
shelter
for
this
child
who
has
no
parents.
all
right.
now,
they
say,
of
course,
they
wanted
that.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
clearly
to
the
contrary.
so
they
win.
now,
what's
your
response?
