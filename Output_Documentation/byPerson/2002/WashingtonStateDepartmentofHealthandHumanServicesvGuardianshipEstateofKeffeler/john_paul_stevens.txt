estate

justice

may
i
ask
you
this
question
related
to
that?
do
you
agree
with
the
position
asserted
in
the
dissent,
with
the
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice

paul

no
finding.

that
effect?
justice

very

justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
mechanics
here?
just
the
facts
are
a
little
hard
for
me
to
understand
at
times.
as
i
understand
it,
many
of
these
children
are
in
foster
homes
and
the
foster
parents
are
paid
by
the
state.
is
the
state
agency
that
pays
the
foster
parents
the
same
agency
that
receives
the
federal
check?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
second
question
i
had...
there's
a
lot
of
discussion
in
the
briefs
about
something
called
sweeping,
which
i
don't
understand.
would
you
tell
me
what
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
if
it
happens
7
months--
justice

--7
months--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
i
asked
the
attorney
general
too?
do
you
also
disagree
with
the
analysis
in
the
dissenting
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
reasons
she
gave.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
there's...
there's
a
statutory
restriction
on
what
the...
when
the
money
comes
from
the
federal
government
that
does
not
apply
when
the
money
comes
from
the
family.
