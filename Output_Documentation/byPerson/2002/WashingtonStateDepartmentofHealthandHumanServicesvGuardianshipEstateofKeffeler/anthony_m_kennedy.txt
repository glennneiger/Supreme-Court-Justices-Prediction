justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
general...
is
it
gregoire
or
gregory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
gregoire.
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
a
set-off
ever
be
legal
process?
suppose
there
were
a
tax
indebtedness
by
the
beneficiary.
could
the
state
just
under...
assuming
that
its
set-off
principles
allowed
it,
could
the
state
simply
take
some
of
the
beneficiary's
money
from
the
social
security
and
set
it
off
against
the
tax
debt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
would
say
there's
no
407
violation
in
that
event.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
think
we're
all
interested
in
the
needs
of
the
children.
in
some
cases,
though,
i
take
it
that
the...
that
the
social
security
payments
are
being
applied
to
reimburse
the
state
for
something
the
child
would
get
for
free
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean
free
in
the
sense
that
the
state
would
pay
for
it
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
we're
talking
about
the...
the
state
has
a
certain...
has
assumed
a
certain
obligation
and
made
certain
payments.
and
in
the
event
the
representative
payee
is
someone
other
than
the
state,
the
state
is
going
to
pay...
pay
those
benefits
and...
and
the
ssi
will
be
available
for
other
purposes.
so
it's...
it's
not
necessarily
always
in
the
best
interest
for
the
child.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does...
does
the
state
have
any
set-off
rights
that
private
entities
don't?
suppose
a
private
person
were
the
representative
payee.
do
they
have
the
same
sort
of
set-off
rights
for
other
debts
as
the
state
does?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
just
talking
about
407
now.
i'm
just
talking
about
407.
because
the
attorney
general
indicated
that
the
state
could,
so
far
as
407
is
concerned,
set
off
a
tax
debt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
assuming
there...
my...
my
question
is
whether...
what
i'm
trying
to
explore
is
whether
the
state
has
some
special
advantages
that
other
representative
payees
might
not
in
the
area
of
being...
of
being
allowed
to
make
certain
set-offs
to
take
certain
funds.
because
if
that's
so,
then
it
sounds
more
like
legal
process.
that
was
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
other
words,
the
state
of
washington
is
not
relying
here
on
any
special
statutory
authority
for
set-offs
that's
applicable
only
to
a
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
your
answer
to
my
407
question
talked
about
405.
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
why...
why
is
this...
why
is
this
legal
process?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it...
why
is
it
something
that
any
representative
payee,
whether
they're
a
state
entity
or
not,
could
not
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
an
odd
term
of
the
use
legal
process,
unless
you're
saying
any
set-off
is
legal
process.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
a
private
entity
just
sets
off
an
earlier
debt
against
current
funds.
that's...
that's
not
legal
process
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term.
it's
a
set-off.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
you
have
to
go...
go
on
and
say
what
that...
why
that's
legal
process.
if
the
grandmother
does
it,
you
would
also
have
to
say
it
is
legal
process
under
your
view
because
it's
authorized
by
the
common
law,
i
suppose,
of
the
state
or
maybe
by
a
statutory
law.
suppose
you
have
a
statute
that
says
a
creditor
can
set
off
against
an
earlier
debt
money
that
the
creditor
receives.
that's
not
legal
process
in
any...
in
any
usual
sense
of
the
term.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
difference
between
wednesday
and
thursday
and
february
and
march?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
it
a
reimbursement
between
february
and
march?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then...
then
if...
if
there's
legal
process
for
the
february/march
transfer,
there's
legal
process
for
the
wednesday/thursday
transfer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm...
i'm
talking
about
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
what
we've
got
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
legal
process
when...
when
we...
when
we
buy
the
groceries
wednesday
and
we
make
the
transfer
thursday.
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
true--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
true
in
either
instance,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
that's...
that's
a
wash,
as
between
february
and
march
and
wednesday
and
thursday.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
then
it's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--then
it's...
that's
why
i...
i
tried
to
lead
to
the
conclusion...
let
me
try
it
again...
that
the
only
way
on
your
analysis
to
avoid
the
implication
of
legal
process
would
be
to
set
aside
funds
received
from
the
social
security
administration
in
advance
for
payment
for
future
groceries.
is
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
what
your
adversary
has...
has
stated,
that
this
is
pursuant
to
authority
of
the
law.
that's
why
it's
legal
process.
