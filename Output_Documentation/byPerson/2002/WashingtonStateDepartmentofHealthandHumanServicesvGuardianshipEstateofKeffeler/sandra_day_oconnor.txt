justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is...
is
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
compliance
with
section
405(j)
properly
before
us,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do...
do
beneficiaries
of
ssi
funds
have
a
federal
right
that
they
can
enforce
through
a
section
1983
action
to
have
the
representative
payee
act
in
their
best
interests?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
there
be
alternatively
some
lawsuit
open--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
1983?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
doesn't...
doesn't
the
statute
basically
leave
it
to
the
commissioner
to...
to
evaluate
whether
a
representative
payee
is
acting
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
have
a
representative
of
that
commissioner
here
before
us
today
saying
that
under
the
statutory
and
regulatory
scheme,
that
payments
such
as
these
for
foster
care
are
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
why
should
we
strain
to
find
otherwise--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and...
and
upset
what's
going
on
all
across
the
country?
i
think
your
position
is
troubling
for
that
reason.
