ms.
patricia
a.
millett
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
question
that
the
use
of
social
security
benefits
to
pay
for
current
maintenance
needs
by
a
beneficiary
or
by
a
parent
as
representative
payee
is
permitted
under
the
social
security
act.
there
is
no
reason
that
the
identical
use
of
funds
would
suddenly
become
a
prohibited
alienation
of
social
security
benefits
just
because
it's
done
by
a
state
as
representative
payee.
the
anti-alienation
provision
of
the
social
security
act
prohibits
the
use
of
judicial
processes
or
similar
coercive
processes
to
divert
funds
away
from
meeting
the
needs
of
a
beneficiary.
but
there's
nothing
in
the
text
or
the
purpose
of
the
anti-alienation
provision
that
supports
the
washington
supreme
court's
conclusion
that
it
prohibits
particular
types
of
payments
and
expenditures
of
funds
that
the
representative
payee
provision
of
the
statute
specifically
permits.
and
that
is
because...
it's
very
important
to
understand
that
when
a
state
serves
as
a
representative
payee,
it
does
not
receive
funds,
and
it
does
not
spend
funds
as
an
interposing
claimant
or
creditor.
instead,
under
the
social
security
program,
it
steps
into
the
shoes
of
the
beneficiary.
it
cannot
act
unilaterally.
it
has
to
be
appointed
by
the
commissioner
and,
once
appointed,
must
act
pursuant
to
the
commissioner's
direction,
supervision,
and
control.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
it
is
not,
justice
o'connor.
the
question
presented
is
limited
to
the
violation
of
the
anti-alienation
provision
407(a).
the
complaint
in
this
case
is
limited
to
407(a).
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix,
page
118,
specifically
the...
the
claim
for
relief,
the
aforesaid
actions
violate
42
u.s.c.
407,
no
allegation
of
violating
405.
and
there
would
be
no
basis,
i
don't
think,
for
the
class
action.
the
class
action
allegations
were
based
on
this
general
rule
of
the
407
violation.
if
there's
particular
allegations
of
misuse
in
particular
cases
for
particular
children,
that
would
be
a
misuse
claim.
it
should
first
be
brought
to
the
social
security
administration.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
what
they
would
do
is
bring...
bring
a
complaint.
if
you're...
if
you're
a
beneficiary
and
you're
dissatisfied
with
the
way
your
payee
is
spending
your
money--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--then
you
can
bring
a
complaint
with
the
social
security--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--they...
i
think--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
not
sure
whether
under
1983,
but
you
could
bring
certainly
a
state
law
conversion
out...
suit
against
someone
if
you
thought
that
they
were
misapplying
your
funds.
and...
and
i
assume
you're
talking
about
1983
because
we're
talking
about
the
state
as--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--payee,
but
the
vast
majority
of
representative
payees
are
private
individuals.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
neither...
make
sure
i
understand
what
you're
talking
about
by
set-off.
but
neither
private
nor
state
officials
would
have
the
right
to
set
off
money
against...
on...
on
their
own
unilaterally
to--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
her...
her
response.
but
if...
but,
first
of
all,
you
have
to
ask
how
you
come
into
possession.
to
undertake
an
offset,
you
somehow
have
to
be
in
possession
of
the
social
security
check,
and
the
state
and
private
people
would
not
come
into
possession
of
that
check
unless
they're
appointed
as
a
representative
payee.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
i
didn't
know
that
they
had
been
appointed
representative
payee.
once
you
are
a
representative
payee,
the
state
and
a
private
payee
are
in
the
same
position
in
that
when
it
comes
to
reimbursing
yourself
for
past
debts,
as
opposed
to
meeting
current
maintenance
needs,
the...
you...
you
are
subject
to
the
social
security
administration's
rules.
they
have
specific
poms
and
regulations
on
payment
of
past
debts
and--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
it
is
not.
what's
important
to
understand
here...
and
i
think
one
of
the
premises
for
respondents'
position
is
some
confusion
about
the
difference
between
current
maintenance
and
past
debts.
past
debts
are
defined
both
in
a
poms,
the...
the
interpretive
manual
done
by
the
social
security
administration,
but
also
in
the
regulations
on
page
216
of
the
petition
appendix,
402.2040(d),
when
it
talks
about
claims
of
creditors
to
be
paid
by
a
representative
payee.
it...
the
limitation
is
on
claims
that
arise
prior
to
the
first
month
for
which
you
become
entitled
to
benefits.
that's
what
a
past
debt
is.
it
would
be
reimbursed
by
a
payee.
any
debts
that
arise
after
you
start
receiving
benefits
are
current
maintenance
costs.
so
if
i
get
a
benefit
check
for
january
but
for
administrative
reasons
the
state
does
not
pay
my
bills
for
that
month
until
march,
that's
not
a
reimbursement.
that
is
payment
of
current
maintenance
by
the
january
check
for
january
costs.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes,
it
is.
there
are
two
different
units
within...
it's
the
department...
in
washington,
it's
the
department
of
social
and
human
services
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
i'm
afraid
it
may
have
different
meanings
depending
on
whom
you
ask
the
question
to.
but
as...
as
it's
discussed
by
the
court
here,
the...
our
understanding
is
that
it...
it
is
this
confusion
about
reimbursement
and
current
maintenance.
what
washington
was
doing
was
it
would
get
a
check
in
may
that
would
be
a
lump
sum
payment
for
february,
march,
april,
and
may.
and
it
would
go
back
and
apply
february's...
the...
the
percentage
of
that
lump
sum
check
that
was
for
february
to
the
february
expenses,
march
to
the
march
expenses.
that
is
the
account
sweeping
that's
talked
about
in
the
court
here
and
that's
all
that
the
record
talks
about.
that
is
not
impermissible.
that
is,
under
our
view,
the
use
of...
use
of
this...
proper
use
of
these
benefits
for
current
maintenance.
the
fact
that
for
accounting
reasons
it
happens
4
months
later
doesn't
change
anything.
now--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--with
respect
to
the
ssi,
the
title
xvi
benefits,
there
is...
there
was
after
october
1996,
and
that's
why
there's
some
confusion
because
this
case
spanned
that
bridge.
but
as
of
october--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--there's
a
lot
of
complicated
things
here.
but
the...
but...
but
for
that
reason,
the
fact
the
commissioner
has
been
administering
this
program
and
the
representative
payee's
program
since
it
started
in
1939
and
it
has
recognized
and
endorsed
the
practice
of
all
50
states
having
foster
care
agencies
doing
this
as
not
violating
the
anti-alienation
provision
is,
i
think,
very
important
to
keep
in
mind
and
that
adopting
the
definition
of
anti-alienation
provision,
using
that
to
police
allegations
of
misuse
under
the
representative
payee
system
would
be
very
confounding
and
confusing
to
the
system.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes,
for...
for
two
reasons.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
yes,
i
think
it
has
again
the
confusion
about
past
reimbursements
which
could
still
be
for
current
maintenance
and
the
payment
of
past
debts.
but
the
other
thing
that
the
washington
supreme
court's
concurring
dissenting
opinion
did
was
it
said
you
could...
you
could
pay
for
maintenance,
but
first
you
have
to
pay
for
special
needs.
that
gets
it
exactly
upside
down.
the...
there's
much
concern
here
about
the
best
interest...
the
best
interest
test
here,
but
the
best
interest
is
a
regulatory
test
designed
to
implement
the
purpose
of
these
benefits.
and
the
purpose
of
these
benefits
in
the
case
of
danny
keffeler,
title
ii
benefits,
is
just
to
replace
the
income
stream
of
the
lost
parent.
that
parent
is
legally
obliged
to
pay
child
support
to
the
state
of
washington.
all
washington
is
doing
is
what
his
mother
would
have
been
legally
obligated
to
do
under...
under
state
law
with
that
same
income.
so
it's
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
these
benefits
to
use
them
for
what
they're
doing.
the
ssi
benefits
are
minimum
income,
establish
a
minimum
floor.
all
that
washington
has
said
is
when
the
federal
government--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--on?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that's
right.
but
it's
important...
it's
important
to
understand
the
limited
role
of
407.
it
said
you
can't
come
get
these
benefits,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that...
that
debts
and
obligations
to
pay
can't
arise
and
that
you
can't
enforce,
against
the
parents
who
may
have
other
income,
child
support
through
other
mechanisms.
you
just
can't
come
after,
through
a
legal
process,
the
social
security
benefits.
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
