justice
david
h.
souter
and
under
405(j),
when
you
go
to
the
social
security
administration,
its
options
are
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
put
you
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
your
theory,
it
seems
to
me,
is
there's
a
choice
here,
when
you
apply
the
best
interest
test,
between
a
child
with
a
full
stomach
and
no
trust
fund
and
a
child
with
a
full
stomach
and
a
trust
fund.
and
you're
saying
the
trust
fund
always
wins.
the
parent
cannot
pay
back
because
it's
always
in
the
child's
best
interest
to
have
the
trust
fund
as
well
as
the
full
stomach.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
know...
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
stability
works
into
this,
but
let's...
let's
forget
the
exceptional
case
for
the
moment.
save
for
that
exceptional
case,
aren't
you
saying
full
stomach
plus
trust
fund
always
wins
under
the
best
interest
test?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
that's
the...
that's
the
hypothesis:
stomach
is
full,
will
be
full,
trust
fund
or
not.
best
interest
says,
put
the
money
in
the
trust
fund.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
--go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
representative
can
be...
the
representative
can
be
removed
if
the
representative
is
misappropriating
funds
or
misusing
the
representative's
position
at
responsibility.
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with...
with
the
legal
process
provisions
of
407.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
saying
that
anytime
the
law
provides
for
action
or
provides
that
action
will
be
lawful,
that
taking
that
action
involves
resort
to
legal
process.
is
that
your
definition?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
reasonable
word
in
there
i
think
is
securing.
all
the
state
is
doing
is
taking
from
this
account
and
putting
into
that
account.
and...
and
i
think
all
the
state
is
doing
is
saying,
under
the
law,
we're
able
to
do
that.
the
law
says
we
can
do
that,
or
at
least
it
doesn't
say
we
can't.
and
i
think
you're
saying
that
whenever
the
state
claims
legal
authority,
it
is
using
legal
process
within
this
statute.
is...
is
that...
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
still
haven't
gotten
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
would...
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if
the
state
were
simply
funding
the...
the
cost
of
food
and
clothing
for
the
current
month
and
on...
on
wednesday
it...
it
paid
a
bill
for
groceries
and
on
thursday
it
presented
this
document
that
allowed
the
transfer
from
the
trust
fund
to
the...
to
the
state's
account?
that
too
would
be
legal
process?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
only
way
the
state
could
do
it
then,
i
take
it
on
your
theory,
is
to
use
the
money
to
pay
in
advance
of
its
own
expenditure
a...
a
fund
from
which
it
then
could
draw
under
its
separate
hat
to
pay
the
groceries.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it...
it
paid
the
grocery
bill
on
wednesday,
and
thursday
it
says,
we're
going
to
transfer
the
money
to
pay
the
grocery
bill.
that's
process
on...
on
your
theory,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
--instead
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
the
state
of
washington
through
the
petitioner
department
of
social
and
health
services
pays
for
foster
care
by
providing
funds
to
those
who
in
turn
support
children
removed
from
their
parents
custody.
the
department
also
receives
and
manages
two
kinds
of
federal
social
security
benefits
on
behalf
of
these
children
and
acting
as
what
federal
law
calls
the
representative
payee
or
trustee
for
many
of
the
children
as
it
is
permitted
to
do
under
the
social
security
act.
under
washington
state
law
the
department
generally
uses
a
foster
child's
social
security
benefits
to
reimburse
itself
for
the
funds
that
has
already
dispersed
to
the
foster
care
providers.
the
respondents
who
are
beneficiary
children
for
whom
the
department
serves
as
representative
payee
file
this
class
action
in
state
court
alleging
that
the
department's
use
of
their
benefits
to
reimburse
itself
violates
42
united
states
codes
section
407(a).
that
section
the
so-called
anti-attachment
provision
of
the
social
security
act
protects
social
security
benefits
from
what
the
law
refers
to
as
execution
levy
attachment
garnishment
or
other
legal
process.
the
state
trial
court
agreed
with
the
beneficiaries
that
the
state
reimbursement
violated
that
section
and
enjoined
the
department
from
continuing
to
reimburse
itself
for
foster
care
costs.
the
supreme
court
of
washington
affirmed
concluding
that
because
the
department's
reimbursement
scheme
involved
what
it
called
creditor
type
acts,
it
involved
a
form
of
other
legal
process
prohibited
by
407(a).
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court
we
reverse.
because
the
department's
activities
do
not
involved
execution
levy
attachment
or
garnishment
before
specific
procedures
prohibited
by
407(a),
the
case
boils
down
to
whether
the
department's
use
of
the
benefits
involves
other
legal
process.
although
the
term
other
legal
process
is
potentially
broad,
the
statute
uses
the
term
restrictively
for
underestablished
rules
of
interpretation,
words
in
the
statute
are
known
by
the
company
they
keep.
thus
other
legal
process
should
be
understood
to
be
processed
much
like
execution,
levy,
attachment,
and
garnishment
and
would
seem
to
require
at
least
some
quasi-judicial
mechanism
by
which
control
over
the
property
passes
through
one
person
to
another
in
order
to
secure
discharge
of
a
liability.
this
definition
is
confirmed
by
the
social
security
administration's
own
interpretation.
applying
the
definition,
it
is
apparent
that
the
department's
activities
do
not
involve
legal
process.
the
state
has
no
enforceable
claim
against
its
foster
children
and
the
department's
scheme
operates
on
funds
already
in
the
possession
and
control
of
the
department
held
on
terms
that
allow
the
reimbursement.
the
department's
reimbursement
method
is
permitted
under
the
social
security
administration's
regulations
and
its
interpretations
of
those
regs
to
both
of
which
we
owe
deference.
in
the
final
analysis,
the
beneficiaries
argumented
and
the
state
supreme
court's
holding
rest
on
the
view
that
permitting
the
department
to
reimburse
itself
for
cost
it
would
otherwise
bare,
violates
provisions
in
the
act
and
the
regulations
that
require
a
representative
payee
to
use
social
security
benefits
in
the
best
interest
of
the
beneficiary.
although
it
is
true
that
the
state
could
not
directly
compel
any
other
representative
payee
to
pay
benefits
over
to
the
state,
that
fact
does
not
render
the
department's
reimbursement
practice
antithetical
to
the
beneficiary's
best
interest
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
the
regulations.
for
instance,
under
her
authority
the
commissioner
of
social
security
has
read
the
open
ended
term
best
interest
in
light
of
the
act's
basic
objectives
to
provide
for
a
minimum
level
of
income.
thus,
she
has
decided
that
a
representative
payee
serves
the
beneficiary's
interest
by
seeing
that
basic
needs
are
met
not
by
maximizing
a
trust
fund.
for
that
matter
if
the
beneficiarie's
argument
prevail
many
children
would
actually
lose
benefits
since
eligibility
for
some
benefits
is
lost
if
resources
creep
up
above
a
minimum
level.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
