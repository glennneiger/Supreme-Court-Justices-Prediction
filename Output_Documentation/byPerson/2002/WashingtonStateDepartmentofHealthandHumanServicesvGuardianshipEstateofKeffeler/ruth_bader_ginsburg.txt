justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
gregoire,
i'd
like
to
just
find
out
if...
let's
say
we
accept
your
argument
this
is
not
a
407
case,
and
then
the
question
is
put,
but
there
are
alleged
misappropriations
here.
for
example,
there's
some
suggestion
of
double
dipping
and
there's
some
other
things
which
may
or
may
not
be
right.
i
don't
know
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
right
of
any
individual
to
go
after
the
representative
payee.
i
thought
that
was
something
within
the
social
security
regs.
i
thought
i
heard
you
say,
oh,
yes,
but
that's
not
a
407
claim.
that
would
be
a
405
claim.
and
i
was
not
aware
that
there
is
such
a
thing
apart
from
the
administrative
process.
is
there
some
right
to
sue
eventually
in
court
under
405?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
gregoire,
can
i
ask
you
about
the
person
who
started
all
this?
as
i
understand
it,
the...
the
grandmother
that
the
state
was
trying
to
displace
as
representative
payee
refused
to
pay
anything
for
the
child's
current
maintenance.
she
was
putting
it
away
in
a
kitty
for
the
child's
college
education.
and
i
suppose
her
theory
was
the
state
is
going
to
pick
up
the
tab
anyway,
so
i
think
the
best
use
for
these
social
security
benefits
is
to
put
them
in
a
bank
account
so
one
day
he
can
go
to
college.
is...
and
i
understand
there
were
two
attempts
to
replace
her
because
she
was
not
spending
the
money
on
current
maintenance.
when
the...
when
the
social
service
agency
is
not
the
representative
payee
but
a
relative
who
doesn't
have
custody
is,
is
there
any
means
of
getting
those
social
security
benefits
used
for
the
current
maintenance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
that
the
basis
on
which
the
alj
ruled?
i
thought
that
was
within
the
social
security
structure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
wasn't
under
state
law,
was
it?
that
was...
that
was
a
federal--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
she
might
have
if
she
had
to
care
for
the
child.
if
she...
if
the
representative
payee...
if
the
child
is
in
the
custody
of
the
representative
payee,
then
the
representative
payee
has
to
pay
for
the
child.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
gives
it...
there's
no
role
for
the
state
court
in
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
that
405(j)
process.
it's
all
federal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
roseborough,
i
want
to
make
sure
that
i
understand
what
you're
saying
because
it
seems
to
me
you're
telling
us
the
social...
the
food
and
shelter
and
clothing
must
be
provided
to
the
child
today
and
tomorrow
and
the
next
day.
so
the
state
is
paying
for
that
immediately,
directly.
the
social
security
check
for
that
month
comes
in
a
little
later.
it
comes
in
a
month
later.
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying
correctly,
when
the
state
takes
the
check
which
it
gets
in
march
for
services
rendered
in
january,
it
cannot
use
the...
that
check
to
pay
itself
back
for
services
it
rendered
in...
in
january.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
their
possession.
and
let's
skip
ez
pass
and
go
back
to
a
parent
who
has
custody
of
her
child.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
parent
has
custody
of
her
child.
she
pays
for
that
child's
food,
clothing,
and
shelter
in
january.
she
gets
the
check
from
social
security
in
march.
so
you're
telling
me
that
she
cannot
use
that
march
check
to
reimburse
herself
for
money
that
she
spent
in
january.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
i
just
would
like
to
know
if...
if...
as
i
see
it,
the
state
agency
is
identically
situated
with
the
parent.
they're
both
providing
food,
clothing,
and
shelter
now,
and
they
will
get
the
federal
check
for
that
food,
clothing,
and
shelter
2
months
later,
at
least
a
month
later.
and
if
you're
saying
that
then
it...
they
both...
the
parent,
the
social
agency...
they
are
debtors...
creditors.
they're
both
creditors
because
they
provided
the
service
already?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
mother
gets
the
check.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
mother
gets
the
check
in
march.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
she
cannot
use
that
for
services
that
she
has
or
food,
clothing
and
shelter
she
has
bought
for
the
child
in
january.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
we're...
we're
told
by
the
government
is
none
of
the
state
court's
business.
i
asked
that
question
expressly
to
find
out
whether
in
the
government's
view
405
is
something
that
any
state
court
could
enforce,
and
the
answer
was
no.
405
is
for...
if...
if
you
think
the
representative
payee
is
not
acting
properly,
you
go
complain
to
the
social
security
administration,
and
it's
entirely
a
federal
law,
not
any
state
court
that
interferes
with
the
representative
payee's
control.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
would
have
no
case
if
you
take
the
social
security
check
that
you
receive
in
february
for
january
to
cover
the
january
period
instead
of
reimbursing
the
state
for
what
it
supplied
in
january.
it
takes
that
check
and
puts
in
the
account
and
says,
now,
this
will
cover
the
march
food,
clothing,
and
shelter.
that
would
be
all
right,
and
you
wouldn't
have
any
407--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
though
the
check
was
supposed
to
be
for
january
and
not
for
april.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
it
not
true
that...
that
in
the
overwhelming
number
of
cases,
the
federal
benefit
is
not
nearly
enough
to
cover
the
care
of
the
child,
that
the...
the
average
ssi
payment
doesn't
make
it
to
cover
the
monthly
needs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
if
we...
if
we
had
the
new
system
now
where
you
take
the
january
check
and
you
pay
for
march
or
april
with
it,
then
the
other
things
that
you're
complaining
about,
the
double
dipping,
what
you
allege...
and
they
may
say,
no,
it's
not
happening...
the
proper
forum
to
determine
that
would
be
the
social
security
administration.
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one...
one
question
that
i'd
like
you
to
ask
because
it's
really
troubling
me
more
than
anything
else
here.
we
have
a
brief
from
the
children's
defense
fund
that
says
most
of
these
children
don't
have
a
wanda
pierce.
they
have
no
one
but
the
state.
they
have
no
one
to
make
out
an
application
to
social
security
administration.
were
not
the
state
agency
operating
the
way
it
is
operating,
there
simply
would
be
no
benefits,
no
social
security,
no...
no
ssi.
there
would
be
that
much
less
available
for
the
care
of
all
these
children
in
the
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
asked
you
to
answer
that
question.
is...
what
the
children's
defense
fund
is
saying
is
that
because
washington
is
doing
what
it
is
doing...
and
it
is
doing
it
because
it's
going
to
get...
it's
going
to
get
the
federal
government
to
pay,
as
these
benefits
were
designed
to
pay,
for
the
food,
clothing,
and
shelter
of
the
child...
that
there
would
be
no
one
to
do
this
and
there
would
be
less
money
in
the
entire
system.
and
that's
the
question
i
asked
you
to
answer,
not
another
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
the
basis
for
that
belief?
