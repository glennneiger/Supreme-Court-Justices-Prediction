ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
court's
questions
have
hit
on
the
key
issues
here,
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
what
i
believe
to
be
the
errors
in
the
state
of
washington
and
the
united
states'
analysis
in
this
case.
i
agree
with
ms.
millett
that
the
social
security
benefits
that
the
state
receives
as
representative
payee
on
behalf
of
these
children
indeed
belong
to
the
children.
and
in
its
role
as
representative
payee,
the
state
essentially
steps
into
their
shoes
to
use
the
benefits
to
serve
their
best
interests.
the
regulation-mandated
transfer
from
a
state
trust
fund
account,
which
is
the
account
in
which
the
state
deposits
the
children's
funds
when
they
are
received,
to
the
state
treasury
occurs
in
the
state
of
washington
because
of
the
operation
of
the
state
statute
and
two
regulations,
one
superseding
the
other,
that
mandate
that
the
state
shall
use
those
benefits
to
reimburse
its
previously
advanced
costs
of
care.
there's
a
singular
exception
in
the
regulations
that
permits
a
state
to
advance
costs
of
care
to
a
social
security
disability
recipient
and
then
later
seek
reimbursement
out
of
the
paid
disability
benefits
for
that
care,
and
that
is
found
at
42
u.s.c.,
section
1383(g)(1).
that
provision
specifically
provides
an
exception
to
the
operation
of
section
407(a),
and
provides
that
where
appropriate
agreements
are
in
place
between
the
state
and
the
commissioner
of
social
security
and
between
the
state
and
the
individual,
that
a
state
may
advance
costs
of
care
in
the
period
between
the
application
for
benefits
and
the
date
on
which
benefits
are
received
and
then
seek
reimbursement
out
of
the
social
security
funds
for
that
period
of
interim
assistance.
apart
from
that
exception,
the
use
of
social
security
benefits
to
reimburse
previously
avanced
costs
of
care
or
public
assistance
is
the
payment
of
a
debt
within
the
meaning
of
the
social
security
regulations.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
yes,
your
honor.
it
cannot
use
that
check
to
pay
itself
back
for
services
rendered
in
march
or
january
without
complying
with
the
social
security
rules
and
regulations
applicable
to
the
authority
to
pay
a
debt.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
it
absolutely
would
be
the
payment
of
a
debt...
past
debt,
and
it
would
be
subject
to
the
same
restrictions.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
then
the
representative
payee,
having
in
its
possession
funds
belonging
to
that
child,
makes
a
determination
whether
or
not
that
is
a
debt
that
should
be
paid
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
or
not.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
the
state
could
pay
for
it
if
they
had,
in
their
possession,
social
security
benefits
that
made
that
an
appropriate
expenditure
of
the
funds.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
whether
or
not
the
parent
could
use
this
child's
social
security
benefit
check
to
pay
herself
for
having
advanced
care
to
the
child
in
january
is
wholly
dependent
on
whether
or
not
that
reimbursement
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
at
the
time
the
benefits
are
received.
ms.
gregoire
and
the
government
misunderstand
the
regulations.
they
cite
to
2040--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--if
they...
if
they
are
using
the...
the
obligation
under
the
social
security
laws
is
not
to
use
the
month's
benefits--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--in
the...
for
the
month
for
which
they
are
paid.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
then
she
must--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--she
has
to
make
a
determination
in
march
at
the
time
she
receives
the
benefits
as
to
what
expenditure
of
benefits
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
let's
say
in
the
interim
between
the
use
of
the
funds
in
january
to...
to
pay
for
whatever
items
were
paid
for
in
january,
the
child
has
suffered
some
event
in
february
or
march
that
requires
the
expenditure
of
those
benefits
or
the
child
needs
a
communication
device
or
a
prothesis--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--and
that's
why
the
social
security
regulations
impose
stringent
guidelines
on
representative
payees
that
want
to
use
benefits
to
pay
back
for
things
that
happened
in
the
past.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
not
necessarily.
in
fact,
the
social
security
regulations
point
out
that
in
the
case
of
a...
of
a
family
unit,
that
is
dependent
on
the
social
security
benefits
of
the
children
in
that
unit,
that
they...
those
benefits
can
be
used
to
promote
the
stability
of
the
family.
and
it
may
be...
well
be--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--if
the
child
has
a
full
stomach
and
if
the--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--absolutely
true.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
the
question
is
when
do
you
apply
the
test
of
current
maintenance
and
using
the
benefits
at
the
time
they
are
received
to
provide
directly
for
the
care
of
the
child
which
is
the
obligation
under
the
social
security
regulations,
and
when
are
the
regulations
with
respect
to
the
payment
of
past
debts
invoked.
now,
ms.
gregoire
argues...
excuse
me...
general
gregoire
argues
that
it's
not
invoked
for
6
months,
and
she
is
relying
on
the
provisions
of
the
code
related
to
certain
lump
sum
benefits
that
provide
additional
protection
to
those
benefits.
solicitor
millett
says
the
same
thing
relying
on
section
24(d).
but
they
are
mistaken
that...
one
illustration
of
their
mistake
is
found
in
the
social
security
administration's
audit
of
contra
county,
california,
where
the
oig
found
that
that
county
was
using
social
security
benefits
to
reimburse
itself
for
care
provided
before
the
benefits
were
actually
received--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--not
if
they
want
to.
they
have
the
right--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--they
think
it's
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
the
state
can
do
exactly
the
same
thing
as
long
as
it
applies
the
same
test.
as
long
as
it
looks
at
whether
or
not
the
use
of
the
benefits
to
reimburse
the
debt
is
the--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
one,
the
social
security
administration
has
consistently,
prior
to
its
pleadings
in
this
case
at
least,
made
the
exact
same
demarcation
that
we
are
arguing
here.
the
social
security
administration
has
said
that
once
a
benefit
payment
is
received,
you
look
backwards
at
every
debt
that
occurred
prior
to
that
date
and
judge
whether
or
not
that
debt
can
be
paid
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
the
current
and
foreseeable
needs
of
the
beneficiary
have
been
met
and
whether
or
not
it's
in
the
best
interest
of
the
beneficiary
to
pay
that
debt.
as
to
going
forward--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--it
does
ask
the--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--because
the--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--if
i
may
first
respond
that
factually
it's
not
true
that
this
is
what's
going
on
throughout
the
country.
the
facts
of
the
various
cases
that
we
know
about,
through
cases
that
have
occurred
in
the
various
states,
illustrate
that
they
take
very
different
or
use
very
different
procedures
with
respect
to
the
funds.
and
we
only
know
of
washington
that
has
a
process
that
compels
the
state
administrator
to
ignore
their
obligation
to
evaluate
the
best
interests
of
the
child
at
the
time
the
benefit
is
received
and
instead
make
a
determination
that
all
of
the
benefits
should
be
used
to
pay
past
debts
to
reimburse
public
assistance
that
was
expended
without
regard
to
the
eligibility
of
the
child
for
social
security
benefits.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
it
has
to
do
with
that
in
this
sense.
the
state
argues
that
section
407(a)
doesn't
apply
to
it
because
it
is
acting
properly
as
a
representative
payee.
we
contend...
and
i
think
we
demonstrate
in
our
brief,
and
the
state
supreme
court
in
fact
held...
that
washington
was
not
acting
as
a
properly
regulated
representative
payee
within
the
meaning
of
section
405(j).
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
i...
i
believe
that
her
response
was
that
you
could
bring
a
state
law
action,
for
example,
for
conversion
against
the
representative
payee
that
failed
to
administer
benefits
in
accordance
with
the
social
security
act.
those
social
security
regulations
themselves
provide
that
you
cannot
sue
the
administration
for
a
representative
payee's
failure
to
use
the
benefits
properly,
but
that
you
may
be
able
to
sue
the
representative
payee
themselves.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
407(a)
clearly
prevents
a
state
from
using
legal
process
like
the
administrative
regulations
here
to
collect
for
past
expenditures.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
it's
legal
process--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--because
washington
is
not
making
an
evaluation
that
the
payment
of
the
debt
to
itself
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
what
it
is
doing
is
acting
pursuant
to
the
compulsion
of
a
regulatory
scheme
that
requires
that
the
first
use
of
the
benefits
be
to
reimburse
itself.
the
social
security
regulations
do
not
state
that
the
use
of
the
benefits
to
pay
current
maintenance--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--a
set-off--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--that
would
be
depending
on
whether
they
were
doing
so
by
operational
law
or
because
of
their
own
volition.
here
the
state
is
clearly
acting
under
what
it
contended
below
at
least
was
the
volition
or
the...
the
obligation
of
law.
it
was
saying
that
the
law
gave
it
the
right
to
secure
or
require
the
use
of
these
social
security
benefits
to
pay
a
specific
obligation,
that
specific
obligation
being
the
debt
to
the
state
that
arose
when
the
state
advanced
funds
for
the
child's
care.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
i'm
saying
that
anytime
the
law
allows
or
permits
the
securing
of
social
security
benefits
to
the
payment
of
a
specific
obligation,
that
that
is
legal
process
or
the
application
of
legal
process
to
those
benefits
in
violation
of
section
407(a).
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
no.
my
position
is
that--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--that
when
the
state
here
acts
to
transfer
the
benefits
from
the
trust
fund
to
the
state
treasury
coffers,
it
does
so
by
presenting
a
bill,
in
essence,
a
statement
of
account
or
a
statement
of
expenditures,
to
the
trust
fund
unit
reflecting
the
past
expenditures
of
the
state
on
behalf
of
that
child.
essentially
it's
saying,
i
have
advanced
monies
for
the
care
of
this
child
and
i
now
want
to
be
paid
back
out
of
the
child's
trust
fund
unit.
fair
enough.
but
the
obligation
of
the
state,
wearing
its
hat
as
representative
payee
of
the
child,
is
to
make
a
determination
at
that
point
whether
that
repayment
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
absolutely
it
would
be,
the
latter
thing
that
you
said,
that
if
a
state
allowed...
if
a
state
statute
allowed
a
set-off
against
a
social
security
benefit
to
pay
a
past
debt,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
section
407(a).
in
fact,
federal
law
provides
that
even
if
the
united
states
itself
seeks
to
set
off
a
debt
like
past
due
taxes
against
social
security
benefits,
that
it
has
to
have
a
specifically
set
out
in
the
statutes
exception
to
section
407(a),
and
that
in
fact
is
what
exists.
there's
a
statute
that
says
by
express
reference
to
section
407(a)
as
required
by
section
407(b)
that
the
united
states
may
set
off
past
due
taxes
against
social
security
benefits.
absent
that
statutory
authorization
or
exception
to
section
407(a),
a
set-off
compelled
by
law
or
authorized
by
law
would
be
within
the
ambit
of
legal
process
or
an
application
of
legal
process
to
benefits
prohibited
by
section
407(a).
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
that...
if
it
was
doing
so--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--the
presentation
of
the
grocery
bill
to
the
representative
payee
for
payment
may...
and...
and
the
payment
that
comes
as
a
result
of
that,
may
not...
may
or
may
not
be
legal
process
depending
on
what
it
is
that
authorizes
that
transaction
and
whether
or
not--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--no,
not
necessarily.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
under
my
theory,
it's
clearly
a
reimbursement.
and
as
a
reimbursement,
it
then
falls
under
the
regulations
with
respect
to
reimbursements.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
it
is
absolutely
a
reimbursement.
that's
exactly
what
we
claim.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
it's
the
wednesday/thursday
process
in
the
hands
of
a
private
representative
payee
not
acting
under
compulsion
of
law.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
there's
two--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--acting--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--then...
but
the
state
of
washington
is
doing
that
because
it
is
compelled
by
statutes
and
regulations
that
mandate
that
it
shall
use
those
benefits
to
reimburse
the
foster
care
costs.
if
it
was
not
operating...
if
it
was
making
a
choice--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--on
thursday--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--not--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--that
is
a
wash.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
so
the
question
is
in
both
instances
on
thursday
or
a
month
later,
is
the
use
of
these
benefits
to
pay
for
that
which
has
been
provided
in
the
past
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
that--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--that
would
be
the
only
way
to
avoid
a
reimbursement
scenario,
would
be
to
use
the
social
security
benefits
first
to
pay
for
those
things
that
the
child
needs.
that
would...
that
would
avoid
the
regulations
respecting
past
debts
and
reimbursement.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
and
that
appears
to
be
what
many
states
do.
for
example,
it
appears
from
the
brief--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--the
check
is...
the
eligibility
of
the
check,
if
it's
an
ssa
check,
is
determined
by
the
child
survivorship
through
january.
so
that's
why
it's
paid
at
the
end
of
january.
a
disability
check,
however,
is
paid
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
for
which
it
is
intended
to
be
used.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
they
will
avoid
violation...
avoid
encroaching
or
violating
section
407(a)--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--it
does
make
a
lot
of
sense
because
the
problems
in
washington's
administration
with
accounts,
we
think,
with
double
dipping,
with
use
of
the
benefits
to
pay
administrative
and
programmatic
costs
instead
of
to
pay
for
items,
food,
clothing,
shelter,
and
special
needs
of
the
child,
could
not
occur
in
a
system
where
the
federal
benefits
were
used
in
the
first
instance
to
pay
for
those
things.
moreover,
in
washington--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--the
average
payment
to
a
disabled
child
is
less
than
the
guaranteed
minimum
under
federal
law
so
that
this
child
would
at
least
be
assured
of
the
use
of
the
full
amount
of
the
federal
benefit
to
which
they
are
entitled
without
set-off
by
the
state.
the
state
could
add
to
it
but
it
cannot,
as
washington
does,
subtract
from
it.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
nor
does
the
payment
that
the
state
makes
under
its
foster
care
program.
in
the...
in
the
case...
in
the
specific
case
of
the
state
of
washington,
the
guaranteed
minimum
payment
under
federal
social
security
law
to
an
ssi-eligible
child
averages
$715
a
month.
the
state
of
washington
pays
the...
a
stipend
to
the
household
of
that
child
of
some
$300
to
$400
a
month
depending
on
the
age
of
the
child.
that
means--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--in
this
case,
the
claim
was
brought
under
state
law
against
the
state
of
washington
for
using
the
benefits
in
a
way
that
was
inconsistent
with
social
security
law.
the
state
of
washington
offered
as...
by
way
of
defense,
that
it
was
complying
with
section
405(j)
and
that
section
407(a)
did
not
apply
to
it.
but
the
state
law
claims
for
conversion
and
misuse
of
the
benefits
remain
and
are
not
dependent
on...
they're
dependent
on
establishing,
as
we
have,
that
the
state
was
misusing
the
benefits,
but
they're
not
dependent
on
the
availability
of
a
direct
remedy
under
the
social
security
rules.
moreover,
section--
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
--this
is
exactly
true
that
what
the
state
of
washington
is
doing
is
using
the
federal
funds
that
are
intended
for
the
individual
benefit
of
disabled
children
and
children
who
are
ssa
recipients
to
fund
the
general
foster
care
system.
ms.

we
believe
that
states
will
continue
to
serve
as
representative
payees
even
if
they're
compelled
to
administer
the
benefits
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
the
social
security
rules.
ms.
teresa
w.
roseborough
the
basis
for
that
belief
is
that
the
state
receives
enormous
benefit
from
having
available
to
itself
the
federal
benefits
and
being
able
to
expend
those
benefits
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
and
to
pay
for
those
things
that
come
within
the
defined
needs
of
the
disabled
children.
it
has
no
reason
to
give
up
that
money.
and
we
don't
ask
it
to.
what
we
do
ask
it
to
do
is
to
administer
those
funds
properly
under
the
social
security
act
and
to
make
a
determination,
before
it
uses
those
funds
to
fill
the
state
treasury,
whether
or
not
or
what
use
of
the
funds
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
that's
exactly
what
the
social
security
administration
has
consistently
required
of
representative
payees.
in
this
case
where
a
state
had...
where
a
child
has
already
received
public
assistance,
which
is
in
part
state
and
in
part
federally
funded,
for
a
state
to
use
another
federal
benefit
that
the
child
receives
to
reimburse
the
expenditures
not
only
of
the
state
dollars
but
also
of
the
federal
dollars
that
were
provided
to
the
state
under
that
program
for
the
use
of
the
child
is
an
abuse
of
the
representative
payee
system.
it
is
a...
and
is
a
disservice
to
the
disabled
child.
social
security
disability
benefits
were
intended
to
provide
for
the
special
needs
of
the
disabled
child,
to
assist
them
in
the
transition
to
adulthood,
and
to
provide
them
some
relief
from
the
burdens
of
their
disability.
in
the
state's
concept,
as
it
would
use
those
funds,
without
any
heed
to
the
best
interests
of
the
child,
no
dollar
of
social
security
benefits
received
by
a
disabled
child
before
they
reach
their
18th
birthday
would
be
available
to
meet
those
special
needs
because
the
state
of
washington
refuses
to
acknowledge
an
obligation
under
the
social
security
laws
to
determine
what
expenditure
is
or
is
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
2040(d)
does
not
provide
that
a...
any
payment
of
a
benefit
is
current
maintenance
if...
as
long
as
it
was
for
food,
clothing,
or
shelter.
it
makes
a
clear
demarcation
between...
and
the
example
in
the
regulation
makes
clear...
between
benefits
that
are
used
at
the
time
they
are
received
to
provide
for
care
and
benefits
that
are
sought
to
be
used
for
care
that
was
provided
before
that.
we
simply
ask
that
the
court
apply
the
generally
applicable
social
security
benefit
regulations
to
the
state
of
washington's
use
of
the
funds
for
reimbursement.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
