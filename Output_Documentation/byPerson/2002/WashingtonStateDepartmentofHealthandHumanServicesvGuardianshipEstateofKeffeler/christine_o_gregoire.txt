justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
representative
payee,
appointed
by
the
commissioner
of
social
security,
violates
the
anti-alienation
provision
of
42
u.s.c.,
section
407(a),
when
it
uses
social
security
benefits
to
pay
for
the
beneficiary's
current
maintenance.
the
plain
text
of
section
407(a)
answers
this
question,
and
the
answer
is
no.
section
407(a)
provides
that
benefits
are
not
subject
to
execution,
levy,
attachment,
garnishment,
or
other
legal
process.
the
department
here
does
not
use
compulsory
legal
process
to
obtain
benefits.
instead,
the
department
is
appointed
representative
payee
by
the
commissioner,
pursuant
to
42
u.s.c.,
section
405(j),
and
as
payee,
the
department
is
under
the
supervision
of
the
commissioner
and
uses
the
benefits
to
pay
for
the
current
maintenance
of
the
beneficiary
in
accordance
with
the
social
security
regulations.
in
short,
when
looking
at
the
statutes
as
a
whole,
407(a)
does
not
prohibit
that
which
is
expressly
authorized
by
405(j).
the
purpose
of
407(a)
is
to
ensure
that
social
security
benefits
are
available
to
pay
the
beneficiary's
current
maintenance
by
preventing
creditors
from
taking
those
benefits.
legal
process,
as
referenced
in
407(a),
is
the
means
by
which
a
court,
agency,
or
official
authorized
by...
by
law
compels
compliance
with
its
demands.
it
is
compulsory
legal
process.
here
there
is
no
legal
process.
the
representative
payee
here
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
beneficiary,
sharing
in
the
cost
of
care,
consistent
with
the
social
security
regulations.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
if...
the
violation
of
407(a)
comes
in...
comes
into
play
when
there's
a
legal
process
that
actually
attaches
to
those
social
security
benefits.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
correct.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
representative
payee?
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
i
believe
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
the
questions
that
have
been
presented
here
by...
by
the
respondents
are
405(j)
questions
as
to
whether
the
representative
payee
acted
accordingly
within
their
purview.
here
there
is
full
compliance
with
the
social
security
regulations.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
department
is
duly
recognized
as
a
representative
payee
subject
to
supervision,
having
to
submit
constant
reports
and
annual
reports
and
accounting
system,
and
there
are
audits
that
have
been
performed
on
the
department.
it
is
acting
in
accordance
with
405(j)
as
rep
payee.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
well--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--yes,
your
honor,
but
if
you...
if
you
look
at
the
complaint
in
this
particular
case
by...
by
the
respondent,
if
you
look
at
the
certification
of
the
class
that's
present
here,
if
you
look
at
the
holding
below,
in
every
instance
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
representative
payee
duly
appointed
can
use
the
benefits
for
the
cost
of
care
of
the
beneficiary.
we
think
the
plain
text
of
407(a)
says
the
answer
is
there
is
no
violation
whatsoever.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
what
the
social
security
act
provides
is
one
of
two
things.
it
can
be
done
by
the
commissioner
by
the
removal
of
the
representative
payee
if
they
have
violated.
it
can
be
done
by
a
court.
but
the
remedy,
if...
even
if
done
by
a
court,
is
back
to
the
commissioner
to
remove
the
representative
payee
and
appoint
one
that
would
act
in...
in
accordance
with
the
regulations.
here,
while
there
are
allegations--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--an
individual,
the...
the
beneficiary
could.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
yes.
but
here,
all
of
those
allegations,
one,
are
not
contained
within
the
holding
below,
but
most
importantly,
there
is
no
record
to
find
any
violation
of
405(j)
in
this
case
whatsoever.
to
the
contrary.
the
department
here
has
acted
absolutely
consistent
with
the
social--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--we...
we
do
not,
your
honor.
we
believe
the...
the
dissent
is
wrong
on...
on
two
bases.
one,
the...
the
court
below
suggested
that
there
was
some
use
of...
of
benefits
for
past
debt--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--when
in
fact
there...
that
is
not
the
case
here
and
there
is
no
finding
to
that
effect
by
the
lower
court.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
only
after
the...
the
remand
and...
and
the
supplemental
brief
that
was
submitted
in
the
state
supreme
court.
but
there...
in
this
particular
case,
what
happens,
by
way
of
clarification,
is
when
the
state
of
washington
gets
a
lump
sum
check
for
an
individual
whose
ssi,
social
security
title
xvi
application
has
been
pending,
they
will
then
use
that
check
to
pay
current
maintenance
for
those
months
for
which
the
child
was
deemed
eligible
for
ssi
and
was
receiving
foster
care
up
to
a
maximum
of
6
months.
that
is
considered
current
maintenance,
not
past
maintenance.
we
think
the...
the
concurring
opinion
was
confused
by
that.
secondly,
the
concurring
opinion
says,
you--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--no.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
it
is.
it
is,
your
honor.
justice
scalia,
what
the
social
security
regulations
put
in
place
with
respect
to
title
xvi
benefits,
ssi,
that
anything
beyond
6
months
by
social
security
itself
is
put
into
an
account
and
allowed
to
accumulate
interest.
it
cannot
be
used
for
the
current
maintenance
of
the
child.
and
the
second
basis...
justice
stevens,
the
second
basis
that
we
think
was
wrong
in...
in
the
concurring
opinion
is
where
she
finds
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
extras
for
the
child
first,
over
and
above
current
maintenance,
and
that
we
submit
to
you
is
in...
contrary
to
the
federal
regulations
themselves,
20
c.f.r.
404.2040,
which
expressly
provides
that
you
look
first
to
the
current
maintenance.
that's
the
very
purpose
behind
both
title
ii
and
title
xvi,
first
to
the
current
maintenance,
and
then
you
guess...
within
the
broad
discretion
accorded
a
representative
payee,
you
may
look
to
see
if
there
are
extras
to
which
those
monies
could
be
spent.
here,
the
department
of
social
and
health
services
uses
the
benefits
for
both,
and
the
record
verifies
that.
but
let
me
bring
to
the
court's
attention
what
we're
talking
about
here.
we're
talking
about
children
who
arrive
in
the
state's
custody
through
a
juvenile
court
proceeding,
having
been
abandoned,
abused,
or
neglected.
they
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
juvenile
court,
and
then
those
children
are
assessed
by
an
individual
service
plan
as
to
what
their
needs
are.
and
what
happens
when
that
assessment
takes
place
is
their
needs
are
being
met
by
the
department.
in
fact,
the
average
payment
for
foster
care
for
a
ssi
child
is
$1,776.
the
average
amount
that
an
ssi
benefit
would
be
is
something
short
of
$500.
and
the
base
foster
care
amount
is
something
short
of
$500.
the
fact
is
the
special
needs
of
these
children
are
being
met
so
their
lives
can
be
turned
around,
they
can
go
back
out
and
be
productive
members
of
society--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--we
don't
submit,
your
honor...
we
think
that's
wrong.
the
fact
that
these
children
are...
are
getting
foster
care
doesn't
mean
it's
free.
in
fact,
the
expectation
of
both
social
security--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--your
honor,
there
is
an
expectation
in
state
law
and
an
expectation
in
the
social
security
act
that...
that
what
this
money
is
to
be
used
for
is
the
current
maintenance
of
the
child.
what
would
be
the
difference
if
we
were
to
submit
that
it's
free
in
the
home
of
a
parent?
a
parent
surely...
and
under
washington
state
law...
absolutely
is
obligated
to
pay
for
the
child's
care
and
maintenance.
are
we
then
to
suggest
that
anytime
a
child
in
the
home
of
a
parent
gets
ssa
or
ssi,
it
can't
be
used
for
current
maintenance
because
the
parent
has
to
use
their
own
funds
for
that
purpose?
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
but,
justice
kennedy,
that
would
be...
that
would
be
the
case
with
a
parent.
a
parent
is
obligated
to
pay
for
the
current
maintenance
of
the
child.
does
that
mean
they
can
never
use
their
ssa
or
ssi
benefit
for
the
child
for
the
current
maintenance
of
the
child?
we
think
not.
consistent
with
the
very
purpose
of
the
social
security
act,
is...
these
monies
are
to
ensure
that
that
child
gets
a
minimum
income
to
pay
for
their
current
maintenance.
the
state
shouldn't
be
treated
any
different
here
than
a
parent
would
be
treated.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
not
by
legal
process,
justice
ginsburg,
which
was
a
lesson
learned
by
the
grandmother,
wanda
pierce,
in
this
case.
the
department
wrongfully
attempted
to
get
at
the
social
security
benefits
by
legal
process.
that's
why
there
is
no
appeal
of
the
specific
danny
keffeler
case.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
well,
you--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--you
could.
the
issue
is
a
405(j)
issue.
the
issue
is
whether
that
person
should
be
paying
for
the
current
maintenance
of
the
child.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
they
should.
but
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
is
washington
state
has
a
specific
statutory
provision
that
says
if
the
child
has
a
guardian,
the
state
cannot
go
in
there
and
then
ask
to
be
representative
payee.
so
there's
a
violation
of
state
law.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
correct.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
correct.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
the
alj
in
the
case
of
danny
keffeler
said
that
there
was
no
finding
that
she
had
wrongfully
used
the
benefits,
but
went
on
to
suggest
at
the
end
that
the
state
hadn't
done
anything
like
submit
a
bill
to
her
showing
an
expectation
that
she
was
responsible
to
provide
for
the
benefit
and
care
of
this
child.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the
point
being--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--well...
and
specifically
what
happened
in
the
case
of
danny
keffeler,
when
the
state
attempted
legal
process
against
wanda
pierce,
that
was
wrong.
that
was
a
violation
of
407(a)--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--but
justice
breyer,
the
remedy
is
the
state
could
go
to
the
social
security
administration
and
ask
them
to
consider
an
alternative
representative
payee
for
the
child
in
this
case
because
wanda
pierce
was
not
providing
for
the
current
maintenance
of
the
child
as
we
believe
she
should.
we
believe--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--under
state
law,
we
believe
the
representative
payee
should
pay
for
the
current
maintenance
of
the
child
whether
in
the
custody
of
that
individual
or
not.
the
remedy,
however,
is
not
by
legal
process
407(a),
but
the
remedy
is
405(j)
process
by
going
to
the
social
security
administration
and
asking--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--correct.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
that's
correct.
and
with
that--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--to
remove
that
individual
as
a
representative
payee
and
appoint
another.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
if...
unless
we
have
a
state
law,
as
i
indicated
in
the
specific
case
of
danny
keffeler,
would
not
allow
us
because
she
was
named
guardian.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
with
that,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
where
is
the
legal
process
in
this
case?
there
is
in
fact
none.
the
only
thing
that's
being
suggested
is
reimbursement
is
the
legal
process.
in
the
case
of
title
ii
benefits,
an
individual
is
eligible
in
january.
social
security
doesn't
pay
until
february.
that
has
to
be
construed
as
reimbursement.
counsel's
interpretation
would
then
turn
the
entire
program
on
its
ear.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
is
not
legal
process.
it's
what--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--judicial,
quasi-judicial.
if
an
individual
has
the
authority
by
law
and...
who
goes
out
and...
and
actually
implements
something
that
takes
the
benefits,
but
it's
more
than
reimbursement
as
we
have--
ms.
christine
o.
gregoire
--we
would
submit,
justice
kennedy,
if
you
look
at
bennett
and
philpott,
what
this
court
found
in
both
those
cases
was
legal
process
was
actual
in
the
one
case
in
implementation
of
a
lawsuit;
in
the
other
case,
the
actual
attachment.
we
have
nothing
of
that
nature
here.
we
have
a
simple...
in
answer
to
your
question
about
is
the
state
asking
for
special
rights,
to
the
contrary.
the
state
is
simply
asking
not
to
be
disadvantaged,
to
be
treated
no
different
than
any
other
representative
payee
which
was
your
holding
in
philpott.
so
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
here
we're
simply
asking
to
do
that
which
any
parent
would
do
in
fulfilling
his
or
her
responsibilities
in
caring
for
a
child.
let
me
also,
if
i
can,
turn
to
the...
the
social
security
reimbursement
idea
of...
of
using
it
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
what
counsel
has
suggested
is
the
only
thing
that's
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
is
extras.
the
state
of
washington
pays
thousands
of
dollars
for
these
children
because
they
come
with
psychiatric
kinds
of
needs.
we
are
not
paying
the
minimum.
we
are,
in
fact,
paying
significant
amounts
of
money.
in
the
case
of
one
of
our
randomly
selected
children,
nacole
blimka,
in
one
month,
over
$2,000.
in
the
case
of
another
randomly
selected
child,
denita
smith,
in
one
month,
over
$3,000.
and
yes,
we
held
the
benefits,
got
no
reimbursement
whatsoever,
to
help
denita
smith
be
reunited
with
her
parent
so
that
her
parent
could
set
up
a
home,
pay
for
the
food
and
the
clothing
and
shelter
that
was
necessary
for
that
child.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
state
of
washington
does
exercise
discretion
which
is
accorded
it,
broad
discretion
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
she
would
simply
ask
you
only
extras
are
in
the
best
interest.
we
would
submit
supplying
food,
clothing,
shelter
is
always
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
and
that
is
what
social
security
suggests.
she
indicates
that
her
complaint
suggests
that
there
is
some
state
law
claims.
to
the
contrary.
the
complaint
all
the
way
along
has
suggested
a
407
violation.
she
further
suggests
that
r.c.w.
74.13.060,
the
statute
in
question
here,
is
mandatory.
to
the
contrary,
it
is
not.
it
allows
the
state
discretion
to
use
social
security
benefits
for
the
special
needs
of
a
child
and
to
reimburse
the
state
which
is
precisely
what
occurs
in
this
particular
instance.
i
ask
you
to
return
to
the
question
presented.
is
there
a
violation
of
407(a)
in
this
case
because
a
duly
designated
representative
payee,
supervised
by
the
social
security
administration,
is
using
the
monies
for
the
current
maintenance
of
the
child.
the
plain
reading
of
407(a)
to
that
question
is
no.
with
that,
we
would
ask
you,
respectfully,
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
washington
state
supreme
court.
thank
you.
