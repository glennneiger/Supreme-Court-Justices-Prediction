although
i
presume
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
against
the
state
for...
for
not
behaving
properly
as
the...
what...
what
is
the...
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
the
representative
payee
within
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
why...
why
is
405(j)
not
at
issue
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
those
points
are
raised,
of
course,
in
the...
in
your
opponent's
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
who...
who
can
invoke
the
court's
assistance?
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
beneficiary
can?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
why...
why
do
you
say
it
is
considered
current
and
not
past?
you...
you
just
decide
6
months
is
a
reasonable
currency
criterion?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
is
it
a
regulation
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it
happens--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
6
months
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
is
there
a
6-month
cutoff
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
little
complicated,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
the
same
thing
true
of
the
guardian
who's
been
appointed
the...
the
designated
beneficiary?
when
a
guardian
gets
money,
the...
the
guardian
reimburses
himself
for
past
expenses.
is
that
also
the
payment
of
a
past
debt?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
that...
or
that
she
wants
the
child
to
go
to
university.
why...
why
would
it
not
always
be
in
the
best
of
the
interest
of
the
child
not
to
pay
back
his
parents
and
put
it
into
a...
a
trust
account
for
future
education?
it
would
always
be
in
the...
in
the
better
interest
of
the
child
than
paying
off
the
past
debt
to
the
parent.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
all
this...
so
what
all
this
litigation
will
have
achieved
is
just
to
compel
the
states
to
use
the
current
checks
that
they
get
for
next
month
instead
of
for
last
month.
you...
you
get
maybe
a
3-month
ride.
i
mean,
i
guess
they...
they
lose
3
months'
worth.
but
so
long
as
they
re-gear
up
their
system
so
they're
paying
for
next
month,
all
of
this
will
go
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
make
a
lot
of
sense?
