mr.
dan
himmelfarb
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
imposed
no
obligation
to
present
evidence
of
petitioner's
background
at
sentencing.
it
imposed
no
obligation
to
conduct
a
more
extensive
investigation
of
his
background
before
sentencing.
those
conclusions
follow
from
a
straightforward
application
of
strickland
versus
washington
which
judges
attorney
performance
by
a
single
standard,
whether
it
was
reasonable
under
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
the
decision
to
choose
a
principalship
defense
and
to
reject
a
mitigation
defense
falls
comfortably
within
the
wide
range--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--my
understanding,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the
basis
for
the
motion
was
that
the
principalship
defense
could
be
undermined
by
presenting
the
mitigating
evidence,
so
they
wanted
to
do
it
separately.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
my
understanding
is
that
under
the
theory
advanced
by
petitioner's
counsel
in
support
of
the
bifurcation
motion,
principalship
alone
would
be
determined
at
the
first
phase
of
the
sentencing.
if
the
jury
found
principalship,
there
would
be
a
second
phase
at
which
counsel
could--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--if
you
look
at
the
actual
proffer
that
was
made
in
support
of
the
bifurcation
motion,
which
is
at
pages
44
and
45
of
the
joint
appendix,
what
counsel
said
was,
i
can
proffer
to
the
court
that
in
a
non-bifurcated
proceeding,
the
defense
is
in
a
position
of
coming
forward
with
evidence
regarding
psychological
history
on
mr.
wiggins.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
page
44
at
the
bottom.
i'm
in
a
position
to
come
forward
with
evidence
regarding
psychological
history
on
mr.
wiggins,
including
aspects
of
his
life
history,
including
a
diagnosis
of
a
personality
disorder,
including
diagnosis
of
some
retardation.
so--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
it's
true
it
was
a
general
proffer
rather
than
a
highly
particularized
proffer.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
think
there's
an
important
point
to
keep
in
mind
here.
the
constitutional
right
petitioner
has
raised
in
this
case
is
not
the
duty
to
know,
it's
the
duty
to
investigate.
the
claim
is
that
the
investigation
was
constitutionally
inadequate.
and
the
other
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
there
is
significant
evidence
in
the
record
that
a
significant
investigation
was
done,
an
investigation
which
we
think
is
constitutionally
adequate.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
agree
that
would
be
problematic,
but
i
don't
think
the
record
bears
that
suggestion
out,
again,
going
to
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
petitioner
makes
that
argument
in
his
brief,
and
there
are
record
cites
to
support
it.
but
we
don't
think
the
record
cites
do,
in
fact,
support
the
notion
that
each
counsel
thought
the
other
was
responsible
for
investigating
the
mitigation
case.
there
were
two
lawyers,
schlaich
and
nethercott.
at
page
485
of
the
joint
appendix,
schlaich
testified
that
after
he
left
the
baltimore
county
public
defenders
office
and
went
to
another
office,
from
that
point
forward
his
co-counsel,
ms.
nethercott,
did
most
of
the
mitigation
preparation
with
his
guidance.
then
ms.
nethercott
testified
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
as
well,
and
her
testimony
was
that
she
had
no
responsibility
for
retaining
experts,
that
that
was
schlaich's
responsibility.
so
i
think
that's
a
far
cry
from
testimony
by
either
that
only
the
other
one
had
responsibility
for
preparing
the
mitigation
case.
each
one
was
testifying
about
his
or
her
particular
responsibilities.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
it
remains
the
case,
though,
that
a
substantial
amount
of
investigation
was
done.
that
testimony--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--in
fairness
to
mr.
schlaich,
i
think
he
was
interpreting
the
question
to
mean
what
was
your
defense
at
sentencing,
not
so
much
what
was
your
mitigation--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
was
just
responding
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
whether
it
was
true
that
each
one
testified
that
the
other
was
responsible
for
the
investigation.
my
only
point
is
that
i
don't
think
the
record
bears
out
that
suggestion
in
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
do,
justice
kennedy.
the
investigation
that
was
done
in
this
case
by
trial
counsel
was
not
materially
different
from
the
investigation
that
was
done
by
post-conviction
counsel.
it
was
trial
counsel,
after
all,
who
obtained
the
social
services
records
that
documented
a
history
of
neglect.
trial
counsel
directed
public
defender
investigators
to
go
out
and
interview
petitioner's
family
members,
which
they
did.
trial
counsel
hired
a
psychologist
to
conduct
clinical
interviews
of
petitioner
which
were
done.
really
the
only
difference
between
what
trial
counsel
did
and
what
post-conviction
counsel
did
was
that
post-conviction
counsel
hired
a
social
worker,
a
so-called
mitigation
specialist,
who
supervised
the
investigation
and
pulled
the
information
together
in
a
report.
but
we're
talking
here
about
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
deficiency
in
the
investigation,
and
any
difference
in
the
two
investigations,
which
is
really
the
fact
that
the
social
worker
was
there
in
the
one
but
not
the
other,
we
think
can't
have
constitutional
significance.
i
do
want
to
say
a
little
bit
about
the
duty
to
present
claim
because
most
of
the
focus
in
the
argument
has
been
on
the
question
of
the
duty
to
investigate.
we
think
that
the
principal
defense
was
reasonable
both
because
a
finding
of
no
principalship
would
have
been
an
absolute
bar
to
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
and
because
the
principalship
case
that
the
state
put
on
here
was
so
weak.
we
also
think
it
was
reasonable
not
to
present
a
mitigation
defense
either
in
addition
to
the
principalship
defense
or
instead
of
it.
it
was
reasonable
not
to
present
it
in
addition
to
the
principal
defense
because
it
had
a...
a
very
serious
possibility
of
undermining
it.
it
was
reasonable
not
to
present
it
instead
of
the
principalship
defense
because
mitigating
evidence
is
just
that.
it's
evidence
that
would
be
weighed
against
aggravating
circumstances.
it
might
or
might
not
lead
to
a
sentence
of
death.
a
finding
of
no
principalship
is
a
categorical
bar
to
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
if
a
single
juror
harbored
a
reasonable
doubt
about
whether
petitioner
had
carried
out
the
killing
himself,
it
would
be
obligated
to
return
a
verdict
of
life.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
absolutely.
there
were
two
different
issues,
one
issue
at
the
guilt
phase,
one
issue
at
the
sentencing,
as
far
as
the...
as
far
as
petitioner's
role
is
concerned.
he
was
charged
with
first
degree
murder.
as
the
jury
was
instructed,
a
conviction
of
first
degree
murder
does
not
necessarily
encompass
a
finding
of
principalship,
a
finding
that
petitioner
himself
had
carried
out
the
killing.
so
it
was
perfectly
understandable
that
petitioner's
counsel
would
think
that
contesting
principalship
at
sentencing
would
be
a
reasonable
strategy.
