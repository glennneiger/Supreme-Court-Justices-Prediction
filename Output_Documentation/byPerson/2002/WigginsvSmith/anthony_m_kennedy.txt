so
that
counsel
referred
to
other
people's
reports
and
other
reports.
can
we
draw
any
inference
from
the
record
that
there
were
some
reports
other
than
the...
i
take
it
it's
the
social...
social
services
report?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
pre-sentence
and
social--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
social
services?
were
there
any
other
documents
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and...
and
the
psychologist's
is
the
social...
social
services
report.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
separate
report.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you--
--what
are
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are...
are
you
making
any
argument
that
the
ruling
on
the
bifurcation
motion
might
also
have
been
different
if
there
had
been
a
proffer
of
this?
or
did
the
judge
rule
on
the
bifurcation
motion
without
knowing
what
the
mitigation
evidence
might
be?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
that's
troubling
because
the
job
corps
overture
is...
is
quite
mild
compared
to
the
repeated
days,
months-on-end
physical
abuse
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
stepfather.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this...
well,
i'll
ask
you.
does
this
permit
us
to
make
the
inference
that
if
he
had
known
this,
he
would
have
brought
it
out?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it's
just
very
difficult
to
see
why
he
would
not
have.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
goes
to
the
tactical
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
a
transcript
of
that
hearing?
he
just
said,
i
want
a
bifurcated
hearing
and
sat
down,
or
did
he
say,
i
want
a
bifurcated
hearing
because
there's
going
to
be
very
substantial
mitigating
evidence
and
i
want
the
jury
to
consider
that
separately?
what
did
he...
do
we
have
a
transcript
of
what
he
said
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
also
doesn't
show
that
there
was
substantial
investigation,
which
is
what
you
went
on
to
say,
and
i
don't
think
it's
supported.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
does
that...
he
does
that
to
argue--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--after
the
fact
that
that
the
judge--
