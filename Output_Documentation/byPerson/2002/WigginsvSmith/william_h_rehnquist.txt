chief

william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
williams
case
is
a
white
horse
for
you,
that
is,
i
mean,
that
it
is
exactly
identical
to
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
go
back
to
strickland
and
you
can't
find
the
principle
that
you're
now
enunciating.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
last
year
in
bell...
bell
versus
cohen...
cone,
we
stressed
that
it
is
a
tremendously
deferential
regard
that
we
have
to
the
lawyer's
action
in
a
case
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
in
the
trial
itself
or
in
a
state

chief

involved
the

issue
had
they...
as
a
separate--
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
--no
two
voices
at
the
same
time.
justice
scalia
is
asking
you
a
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
do
you
think
the
test
is
that
williams
against
taylor
lays
down
as
to
determining
a...
a
probability
of
a
different
outcome?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is...
is
that
a
common
motion
in
maryland
capital
cases,
to
try
to
bifurcate
the
sentencing
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
would...
they
would
be
fighting
over
the
principalship
too,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
verrilli.
mr.
bair.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--these
are
footnotes
in
the
state
court's
opinion
or
footnotes
in
the...
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the...
the
post-conviction
proceeding
extended
over
a
period
of
5
months.
how
many
trial
days
were
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
had
recessed
and
then
resumed--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--several
times.
