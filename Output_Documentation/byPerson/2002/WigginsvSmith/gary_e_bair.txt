mr.
gary
e.
bair
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
first
start
with
a
correction
in
the
factual
record
in
this
case.
counsel
for
petitioner
has...
has
referred
the
court
to
ja605
and
606.
and
indeed,
that
was
a
comment
made
by
the
post-conviction
court
during
the
state
post-conviction
proceedings.
however,
that
was
an
oral
comment
from
the
bench
in
april
of
1994.
the
post-conviction
court's
written
opinion
did
not
issue
until
1997.
and
in
the
post-conviction
written
opinion...
it
was
a
257-page
written
opinion.
and
that
written
opinion
basically
countermanded
and
superseded
and
disavowed
the
statements
that
are
on
page
ja605
and
606.
if
you
look
to
page
137a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
that
is
where
you
have
the
excerpts
from--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--137a,
your
honor.
that
is
where
you
have
the
excerpt
from
the
state
habeas,
state
post-conviction
court's
written
opinion.
and
if
you
look
at
footnote
261
on
that
page--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--this
is
in...
these
are
footnotes
in
the
state
post-conviction
court's
opinion.
it
was,
as
i
said,
a
very
lengthy
opinion
and
had
several
hundred
footnotes
as
well
as
257
pages.
by
the
time
the
post-conviction
court
rendered
its
final
decision,
its
written
decision,
it
had
the
transcripts
from
the
post-conviction
proceeding.
and...
and
as
you
may
recall,
the
post-conviction
proceeding
lasted
5
months.
testimony
was
taken
over
7
days
in
a
5-month
post-conviction
hearing.
that
footnote
261
is
the
transcript
that
justice
scalia
was
referring
to
which
is
on
ja490
and
491.
so
this
is
the
testimony
that
the
post-conviction
court
used
to
make
its
fact
finding.
and
in
its
fact
finding
it
said
schlaich
had
more
information
than
appeared
in
the
psi
report.
i
would
go
back
to
what
was
said
earlier.
there
were
several
sources
of
the
information
for
trial
counsel.
in
fact,
i
would...
i
would
tally
them
up
to
be
six
different
sources.
you
had,
obviously,
the
dss
reports,
the
lodged
material
that
justice
breyer
referred
to,
220
pages
of
social
background,
educational
background,
medical
background,
because
petitioner
was
in
foster
care
from
when
he
was
about
6
years
old
to
when
he--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
think
he
got
a...
he...
he
got
a
social
history
in
a
different
way,
your
honor.
he
didn't
hire
a
forensic
social
worker.
instead,
he
obtained
lengthy
dss
reports,
hired
a
psychologist,
hired
a
criminologist,
talked
to
family
members,
talked
to
the
client.
he
didn't
do
it
in
the
way
that...
that
counsel
now
says
it
should
have
been
done.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
think
they
do
it
in
different
ways,
your
honor.
i
think...
i
think
sometimes
they
use
forensic
social
workers.
sometimes
they
use
psychologists.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
think--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
think
it's
wrong.
i
think
it's
wrong,
your
honor.
i
think
that
lawyers
in
maryland
use
psychiatrists,
they
use
psychologists,
they
use
social
workers,
they
use
combinations
thereof.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
pardon
me?
mr.
gary
e.
bair
he...
he
used
a
psychologist
and
he
used
a
criminologist.
and
he
obtained
very
lengthy
dss
records.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
yes.
they're
all...
they're
all
in
the
lodging.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
your
honor,
a
couple
of...
a
couple
of
points
to
be
made.
first
of
all,
i...
i
agree,
and
i
think
we
state
in
our
brief,
there
is
no
specific
reference
to
sexual
abuse
in
those...
in...
in
the
lodging.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
well,
there
is,
your
honor.
that...
that
goes
back
to
ja490
and
491.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
but
the
lawyer
explicitly
testified
that
he
knew
of
it.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
the
written
reports
and...
and
i
think
the
reports
of
others
could
be
either
written
reports
or
oral
reports.
i
think--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--your
honor,
again,
two...
two
points
to
be
made.
one
is
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
or
any
lack
of
a
record
here,
i
think
under
strickland
that
inures
to
the
detriment
of
petitioner.
he
had
the
burden
at
this
hearing
to
rebut
the...
the
strong
presumption
of
competence,
the
strong
presumption
of
reasonable
conduct.
but
let
me
go
back
to
what
the
reports
were.
you
had
reports
from
the
client.
and
i
think,
although,
as...
as
was
asked
earlier
by
justice
souter,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
say
whether
he
spoke
to
his
client.
i
think
we
can
infer
that
he
spoke
to
his
client.
he
represented
him
for
close
to
a
year.
counsel
for
petitioner
at
post-conviction
never
pursued
those
lines
of
questioning.
so
i
think
we
can
assume
that
this
lawyer
talked
to
his
client.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
there
were
7
days,
your
honor,
where
testimony
was
taken
in
those
5
months--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--yes.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
yes,
several
times.
it
was--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
agree.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
agree.
i
think--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--no,
but
i
think
logically,
going
back
to
the
reports
of
sexual
abuse,
there's
only
one
person
that
could
have
come
from
because
even
the
selvog
report,
which
is
what
post-conviction
counsel
prepared...
selvog
testified
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
that
his
sole
source
for
the
information
about
wiggins'
sexual
abuse
was
from
wiggins
himself.
now,
wiggins
obviously
spoke
to
his
attorney.
he
spoke
to
the
psychologist
who
interviewed
him.
he
spoke
to
the
criminologist
that
trial
counsel
hired.
clearly,
i
think
an
inference
can
be
drawn
that
wiggins
reported
that
sexual
abuse
either
directly
to
his
attorney
or
to
the
criminologist
or
to
the
psychologist.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
yes.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
yes,
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
either
wiggins'
own
statements
or
the
reports
of
the
other
experts
in
the
case.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
right.
there
was--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--from
wiggins.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
this
was
all
going
on--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--yes,
yes.
and
those
reports
were
prepared
before
trial
or
between
trial
and
sentencing.
there
was
a
2-and-a-half
month
postponement
between
the
time
of
this
trial
and
the
time
of
the
sentencing.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
yes.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
or
i
guess
the
only...
the
only
other--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--yes.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
the
only
other--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
gary
e.
bair
the
only
report
that
refers
to
sexual
abuse...
now,
the
only
written
report
that
refers
to
sexual
abuse
is
the
selvog
report.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
the...
the
selvog
report
was
the
one
done
by
the
social
worker
during
post-conviction
by...
by
post-conviction
counsel.
the
psychologist's
report
was
an
oral
report.
so
we
don't
really
know
exactly
what
he
knew
because
there...
that
was
never
reduced
to
writing.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
no.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
no.
i
think
he...
he
was
referring
to...
he
could
have
been
referring
to
reports
of
wiggins
himself.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
oral
reports.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
don't
think
it
has
to
refer
to
written
reports,
your
honor.
the
only...
just
to
follow
up
with
justice
breyer,
the
only
other
report
was
the
pre-sentence
investigation.
that
was
the
other
written
report
that
was
available
to
counsel.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
no,
no,
no.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
well,
i
think
two
points,
your
honor.
one,
counsel
did
testify
and
it
was
undisputed...
it
was
never
in
any
way
negated
through
cross
examination
or
any
other
vehicle...
that
he
knew
of
sexual
abuse.
in
fact,
he
specifically
answered
the
question,
the
more
specific
sexual
abuse
question,
i
knew
about
the
job
corps
overture.
so
those
answers
are
unequivocal
and
they
stand
in
the
record
unchallenged.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
agree.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
think--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--well,
i
think
he
made
a...
a
reasonable
tactical
decision.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
think
he
made
a
reasonable
tactical
decision.
he
had
a
powerful
case.
under
maryland
law,
the
jury
had
to
find
unanimously
and
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
wiggins
was
the
principal,
that
is,
the
actual
killer
in
this
case.
they
also
had
to
find
unanimously
and
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
murder
and
the
robbery
occurred
at
the
same
time,
and
there
was
evidence
in
this
case.
this
was
a
very
unusual
situation
in
that
it
wasn't
even
clear
whether
the
robbery
occurred
simultaneously
with
the
murder.
there
was
a...
there
was
a...
a
huge
dispute
at
trial
and
at
sentencing
over
when
ms.
lacs
was
killed
because
her
body
was
discovered
on
a
saturday.
wiggins
was
in
possession
of
her
car--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--yes,
absolutely.
he
challenged
and...
and
very
strenuously
both
during
opening
and...
and
closing...
pointed
out
the
evidence
in
the
case
that
showed
there
were
five
fingerprints
in
ms.
lacs'
apartment
that
were
not
tied
to
anyone.
there
was
a
hat,
some
sort
of
a
baseball
hat,
that
was
in
the
apartment.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
no.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
there
was
any
particular
person
who
was
another
suspect.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
no.
and
that...
that
was
never
challenged
as
part
of
any
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
in
these
proceedings,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
of
course,
our
position
is
they
were
doing
it.
they
had,
as...
as
i
said,
lots
of
information.
they
were
doing
it.
they
were...
they
were
keeping
that
option
open.
but
another
answer,
your
honor,
is
the
evidence
would
not
have
been
put
on.
the
more
evidence
that...
that
actually
came
out
in...
in,
you
know,
the
proceedings,
the
details
that
we've
now
learned
of
through
the
selvog
report,
they
are
so
double-edged.
they
are
so
potentially
harmful
particularly
in
the
context
of
this
case.
between
the
selvog
report
and
the
lodged
materials,
the
dss
records,
the...
the
jury
would
have
heard
not
just
that
kevin
wiggins
was...
had
been
in
foster
care
and
had
a
clean
record,
which
is
all
they
did
hear.
in
addition,
if
those
records
had
come
in,
they
would
have
heard
that
he
hated
his
biological
mother,
that
he
was
in
fights
with
other
foster
children,
that
he
had
once
stolen
some
gasoline
and
tried
to
set
fire
to...
to
a
building,
that
he
had
a
disturbed
personality--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--there...
there
was
no
need
to,
your
honor.
there's
no
need
under
maryland
law
to
give
a
detailed
proffer.
they...
they
did
not
want
to
tip
off
the
other
side
as
to
any
potential
things
that
might
be
negative
to
their
client.
and
again,
to
the
degree
that
we
don't
know
about
the
details,
it...
it
inures
to
the
detriment
of
wiggins.
it
was
his
burden
to
bring
out
all
of
this
evidence
and
he
didn't
do
it.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
no.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
of
course--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--i
think
it
was...
it
was
the
trial
court's
discretion.
i
think
it
was
just
a...
this
was
back
in
1989.
there
wasn't
a
lot
of
definitive
law
on
it
at
the
time.
since
then,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
has
said
absolutely
not.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
think
we
do
have
a
transcript,
your
honor,
and
my
recollection
is
that
there
was
a
short
discussion
of
it,
not...
not
a
detailed
discussion
of
it.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
it
would
have
been
stronger,
your
honor,
but
i
think
in
all
likelihood
if
you
look...
if
you
look
at
the
maryland
sentencing
law,
it
contemplates
it,
as
i
said,
the
court
of
appeals
in
maryland
has
since
held
definitively.
in
fact,
in
the
direct
appeal
in
this
case,
in
the
wiggins
case
itself
on
direct
appeal,
they
have
held
that
the
maryland
sentencing
procedure
in
capital
cases
requires
that
the
jury
go
through
certain
steps,
and
those
steps
all
have
to
be
done
at
a
unitary
hearing.
obviously,
there's
a
bifurcated
guilt/innocence
and
sentencing.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
agree.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
they...
they
did--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--no,
not...
not
really,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
e.
bair
i
don't...
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
i
think...
i
think
what
counsel
did
is
if
you
look
at
the
essence
of
the...
the
approach
at
sentencing,
clearly
it
was
we're
contesting
principalship.
there
was
one
comment
about
you're
going
to
hear
what
a
tough
life
he
had.
now,
that
was
done
i
think
for
a
couple
reasons.
one
is
counsel
knew
that
petitioner
could
allocute
and
probably
would
allocute
personally
to...
to
the...
the
jury.
they
also
knew
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
criminologist
who
was
going
to
testify
because
the
jury
knew
there
was
only
two
choices
for
this
man,
either
life
or
death.
that
was...
and
life
without
parole.
but
they
knew
it
was
either
life
or
life
without
parole
or
death.
and
they
were
also
putting
on
evidence
by
a
criminologist
that
would
show
that
wiggins
would
adjust
well
to
a
life
sentence.
so
i
think
they...
they
also
knew
that...
that
the
pre-sentence
report--
mr.
gary
e.
bair
--thank
you,
your
honor.
