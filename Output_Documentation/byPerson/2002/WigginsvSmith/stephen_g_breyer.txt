justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
my...
look,
there
is
a
document
here
called
lodging
and
it
says,
baltimore
city
department
of
social
services
department
file.
now,
in
looking
through
it
briefly,
i
cannot
find
in
it
all
the
references
that
you
say
are
not
in
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
they're
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
this
says,
other
people's
reports,
and
i'm
perhaps
going
to
hear
in
about
20
minutes
from
now
that
there
could
be
other
reports
to
which
he
was
referring
which
are
not
in
this
document
and
which
might
be
those
other...
those
other
interviews
with
other
people,
et
cetera.
in
other
words,
i
don't
want
you
to
sit
down...
it's...
it's
one
thing
if
i'm
supposed
to
look
at
this
document
and
say
did
this
lawyer
investigate
the
background,
and
the
answer
i
think
would
be
no.
but
it's
quite
another
thing
if
he
knew
all
kinds
of
other
things
from
other
sources,
namely
about
the
burned
hands,
all
the
things
you've
listed.
so
i
want
to
be
sure.
now,
you're
referring
me
one
other
thing,
the
proffer.
but
in
respect
to
the
proffer,
since
i've
read
the
briefs,
i
suspect
i
will
hear
the
following.
of
course,
he
didn't
want
to
proffer
this.
his
strategic
decision
was
to
make
the
jury
think
that
this
man
might
not
have
done
it,
and
the
more
lunatic
we
make
him
sound,
the
more
the
jury
is
going
to
think
the
opposite.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
i
suspect
i'll
hear
that
because
i've
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
would
like
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
about
the
first
part
which
was
justice
kennedy's
part,
i
think
so
far
all
of
our
parts...
questions,
which
is
when
you
read
just
the
part
that
justice
scalia
read
to
you...
and
he
says
it's
on
the
basis
of
other
people's
reports...
will
the
other
side
concede
or
how
do
we
know
it's...
what
he's
referring
to
is
this
document
rather
than
some
other
set
of
documents?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
the
dss
records
that
he
obtained...
are
they
all
in
the
lodging
or
there
are
some
other
ones?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
if...
if...
it's
5
months...
it
took
5
months.
they
went
into
this
in
great
care.
you've
given
us
the
lodging.
i've
looked
through
the
lodging,
my
law
clerk
more
thoroughly.
i
can't
find
a
word
about
the
sexual
abuse.
i
can't
find
a
word
about
the
frightful
things
that
he...
one
i
did
find
where
it
said
for...
when
he
was
taken
from
his
mother
at
age
6,
it's
true
that
the
mother
hadn't
fed
him
for
2
days.
all
right.
that's
there,
but
none
of
this
other
stuff
is
there.
and...
and,
indeed,
if
he
looked
at
any
of...
anywhere
for
this
other
stuff,
where
would
he
have
looked?
why
wasn't
that
in
the
record
which
took
5
months,
if
in
fact
he
looked?
why
was
there
no
more
reference
to
it
than
an
ambiguous
statement
where
he
seems
to
refer
to
the
lodging?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
actually...
to
me
that's
the
most
serious
thing
there
is,
i
mean,
in
terms
of
shaping
an
individual
who
could
later
turn
out
the
way
that
some
have
turned
out.
and...
and
there
is...
it
was
horrible
in
this
case,
and...
and
there's
absolutely
no
reference
whatsoever
that
i
can
find
that
suggests
that
this
lawyer
even
knew
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
said
he
knew
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
was...
that's
why
i
want
to
know
since...
since
that
statement,
the
two
pages
out
of
5
months,
when
i
read
them...
people
can
characterize
them
differently,
but
it
seemed
to
me
ambiguous,
and
the
written
reports
could
have
easily
referred
to
what
i
call
the
lodging.
but
if
they
didn't
refer
to
the
lodging,
what
did
they
refer
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
he
said
was...
what
did
he
say?
he
said,
in
other
people's
reports.
yes,
they
could
have
been.
so
i
would
like
to
know.
there's
been
5
months
of
trial,
as
you
said.
there
have
been
endless
proceedings.
in
your
opinion,
what
did
they
refer
to
if,
in
fact,
they
did
not
refer
to
the
lodging?
because
if
they
did
refer
to
the
lodging,
the
lawyer
in
those
two
pages
out
of
the
5
months
simply
made
a
mistake,
repeating
what
he
knew
later
and
thinking
that
he
had
learned
it
earlier
from
the
lodging.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
your
knowledge...
and
this
is
quite
important
to
me.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
the...
if
they
were
not
referring
to
the
lodging
which
contains
the
reports,
if
they
were
not
referring
to
that
document,
they
must
have
been
referring
to
or
they
were
referring
to
wiggins'
own
statements.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
other
experts
in
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
would
have
gotten
them
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
after
the
trial
was
over.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before,
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
criminologist
and
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
so
the
words,
other
people's
reports,
could
have
meant
wiggins
told
me
or
an
expert
whom
i
hired
who
talked
to
wiggins
told
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oral
reports.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
didn't
have--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
what's
worrying
me
obviously
is
we're...
we're
turning
an
awful
lot
here
on
this
word,
other
reports,
which
came
in
a
fairly
long
hearing
and
which
would
normally
be
taken
as
referring
to
written
reports,
though
it
doesn't
say
that.
and
i'm...
that
makes
me
concerned.
i'm
not
sure
where
to
go
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
bifurcated...
i've
never
heard
of
a
bifurcated
sentencing
hearing.
how
does
that
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
so
what
do
you
do?
you
present
the
principalship
defense
and
then
the
jury
votes
death
or
life,
and
then
if
they
vote
death,
they
go
on
and
present
the
next
one,
and
if
the
next
jury
or
the
same
jury,
having
heard
the
other
one,
votes
life,
then
it's
life?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
under
those
circumstances,
they're
saying
that,
obviously,
in
that
motion
he
would
have
given
everything
he
knew
about
the
background
since
he
thought
it
might
work
that
way,
and
if
he
didn't,
that's
evidence,
in
fact,
amazingly
convincing
evidence,
that
he
didn't
know.
he
didn't
know
about
the
sexual
history.
and
the
main
argument
they're
making
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
strategic
choice.
it
has
to
do
with
his
failure
to
investigate.
so
what's
your...
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
says
nothing
whatsoever
about
the
most
frightful
sexual
abuse,
about
having
the
mother
who
did
all
the
things
that
this
one
particularly
did,
not
feeding
them,
burning
their
hands
on
the
stove,
et
cetera.
i
won't
list
it.
but
i
just
don't
see
anything
in
the
thing
you've
just
read
that
suggests
that
he
knew
a
single
thing
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
and
so
their
point
is,
obviously,
if
he
had
known
about
it,
he
would
have
said
something,
and
the
fact
that
he
didn't
say
something,
when
coupled
with
the
ambiguities
on
the
pages,
you
know,
404
or
405
or
401-402...
you
get
what
we're
talking
about,
the
footnote...
coupled
with
that
shows
that
the
correct
reading
of
that
is
he
didn't
know
about
it.
