justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
wasn't
williams
decided
after
the
maryland
supreme
court's
opinion
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
therefore,
it
can't
be
used
for
purposes
of
deciding
whether
what
maryland
did
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
then-existing
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what
this
case
is
about,
mr.
verrilli,
about
failure
to
investigate?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
seem
to
me
if
it
were,
you
would
have
to
establish
pretty
clearly
that
counsel
did
not
know
these
many
things
that
you
say
he
did
not
know.
and
in
fact,
counsel
was
never
asked
the
question,
did
you
know
this,
did
you
know
that,
did
you
know...
we
don't
know
what
counsel--
i...
i'm
looking
at
the
joint
appendix
on
page
490.
he
knew
a
lot
of
these
things.
he's...
he's...
he's
asked
did
you
know
that
wiggins
had
been
removed
from
his
natural
mother
as
a
result
of
a
finding
of
neglect
and
abuse
when
he
was
6
years
old?
yes,
he
says,
i
knew
that.
that
was
in
the
social
service
records.
so
you
knew
it.
yes.
you
also
knew
that
there
were
reports
of
sexual
abuse
at
one
of
the
foster
homes.
yes,
he
knew
that.
you
also
knew
he
had
his
hands
burned
as
a
child
as
a
result
of
his
mother's
abuse
of
him.
you
also
knew
about
homosexual
overtures
made
towards
him
by
his
job
corps
supervisor.
and
you
also
knew
he
was...
he
was
borderline
mentally
retarded.
now,
that...
that
examination
could
have...
could
have
gone
further,
but
you
didn't
know,
did
you,
this,
this,
this,
this,
and
this.
there's
no
examination
like
that.
we
know
that
he
knew
many
things
about
this
person's
background,
but
we
don't
know
that
he
didn't
know
the
rest
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
do
we
know
that
he
didn't
know
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
have
to
correct
you.
that...
he...
he
didn't
say
that
all
of
this
that
he
knew
he
only
knew
because
it
was
in
other
people's
reports.
the
question
was...
he
had
just
said...
and
you
also
knew
that
he
was
borderline
mentally
retarded.
yes.
he...
then
another
question
is
begun.
you
knew
all...
he
interrupts
the
question
and
he
says,
at
least
i
knew
that
as
it
was
reported
in
other
people's
reports,
yes.
the
that
was
the
fact
that
he
was
borderline
mentally
retarded.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
how
it
reads.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
fourth
circuit
must
have
read
it
wrong
because
that's
the
way
it
reads.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
it
say,
and
nothing
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
you're
making
it
as
though
it
was
a
factual
finding
that
this
is
all
that
he
knew.
now,
they
knew
that
he
knew
that,
but
they
didn't
make
a
factual
finding
that
he
didn't
know
anything
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
verrilli,
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
the
habeas...
the
state
habeas
decision
that
you...
that
you
cited
us
to,
which
is
on
the
joint
appendix
page
604.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
if
you're
making
a
claim
of
failure
to
investigate,
the
burden
is
on
you
to
show
that
counsel
did
not
know
things
that
he
would
have
learned
on
investigation.
the
burden
is
on
you.
as
i
read
this
court's
decision,
what
the
court
is
simply
saying
is,
i
don't
ever
remember
a
death
penalty
case
where
there
was
not
a
social
history
done.
and
so
it
was
simply
unthinkable
not
to
have
a
social
history.
then
when
you
go
across
the
page,
so,
therefore,
based
upon
the
evidence
that
i
have
seen,
i'm
concluding
it
was
error
for
them
not
to
investigate
it
because
i
don't
have
any
information
before
me
to
believe
that
they
did
not
have
this
information
available
to
them.
you
see
the
context?
and
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
but
the
context
of
this
case
is
that
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
did
have
all
of
this
information.
that's
not...
that's
not
enough
to
satisfy
your
burden.
that
court
would
have
had
to
find
i
believe
that
they
did
not
have
this
information,
not
i
just
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
had
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
should
have
had
to
find
they
did
not
have
this
information.
it
doesn't
find
that.
it
just
says
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
had
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
tell
me
what
it
means.
it
says--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
did
have
all
of
this
information.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
earlier
the...
the
trial
judge
says,
i
just
don't
think...
i...
i
don't
know
any
capital--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
know
any
capital
case
in
which
a
social
history
wasn't
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
he...
i
think
he
reversed
simply
because
you're
always
supposed
to
do
a
social
history.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
he
reached
the
conclusion
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
reached
the
conclusion
because
he--
justice
antonin
scalia
he
reached
the
conclusion
because
he
said,
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
had
the
information.
he
never
made
the
finding
that
they
didn't
have
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bair,
you...
you
seem
to
accept
that...
that
all
that
he
knew
was
as
it
was
reported
in
other
people's
reports.
but
i
just
don't
read
the
text
that
way.
he
said,
at
least
i
knew
that
as
it
was
reported
in
other
people's
reports.
and
the
that
in
that
transcript
is
that
he
was
borderline
mentally
retarded.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
the
only
thing
that
he
said
he
got
from
other
people's
reports.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
know
where
he
got
all
of
the
other
information
that
he
said
he
had.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
he
was
mentally
retarded.
it
only
goes
to
whether
he
was
mentally
retarded.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bair,
what...
what
do
you
respond
to
opposing
counsel's
argument
that
it
doesn't
matter
because
you
didn't
know
until
the
eve
of
trial
that
you
wouldn't
have
had
a
bifurcated
proceeding,
so
you
should
have
been
doing
this
research
in
contemplation
of
a
bifurcated
proceeding?
justice
antonin
scalia
--does...
does
the
strength
of
the
mitigating
evidence
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
a
bifurcated
proceeding
is
allowed?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
they
have
been
more
likely
to
get
the
bifurcated
proceeding
if
they
had
come
up
with
a
lot
of
information
about
his
childhood
and
so
forth?
