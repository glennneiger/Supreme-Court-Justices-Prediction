mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
clearly
established
law
of
strickland
v.
washington,
a
lawyer's
decision
about
how
to
defend
a
client
facing
a
death
sentence
must
be
supported
either
by
a
thorough
investigation
or
by
a
reasonable
professional
judgment
supporting
limitation
on
investigation.
in
this
case,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
and
the
fourth
circuit
applied
that
rule
in
an
objectively
unreasonable
manner.
kevin
wiggins'
lawyers
did
not
fulfill
what
this
court
described
in
williams
against
taylor
as
their
obligation
under
strickland
to
investigate
thoroughly
their
client's
background,
and
no
reasonable
professional
judgment
in
fact
supports
or
could
support
their
failure
to
do
so.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
do
not
think
it's
exactly
identical
to
this
case,
your
honor,
but
we
think
it
clearly
informs
this
case
both
by
explaining
what
an...
what
an
objectively
unreasonable
application
of
strickland
amounts
to
and
in
emphasizing
the
critical
importance
of
investigating
a...
a...
your
client's
background
as...
as
a
prerequisite
to
making
informed,
reasonable
choices
about
how
best
to
defend
your
client.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
it
was
justice
scalia,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
disagree
with
that,
justice
scalia,
for
the
following
reason.
williams,
like
this
case,
was
an
aedpa
case
and
all
williams
could
do
was
decide
whether
strickland
had
been
unreasonably
applied.
williams
was...
because
williams
was
an
aedpa
case,
was
a
2254(d)(1)
case,
williams
could
break
no
new
ground
by
definition,
and
therefore,
the...
the
fact
that
williams
concluded
what
it
did
about
strickland's
requirement,
means
that
that
is
what
strickland
requires.
and
that...
and...
and
so
we
don't
think
it...
we're
going
beyond
aedpa
in
the
least.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
oh,
no,
no.
i
disagree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
it's
right
on
page
690
and
691
of...
of
strickland,
and
here's
the
principle
that
we
think...
strickland
specifically
says,
as
we
read
it,
that
a
lawyer's
judgment
about
how
to
defend
a
client
has
either
got
to
be
based
on
complete
investigation
or,
if
it's
based
on
less
than
complete
investigation,
it's
reasonable
only
to
the
extent
that
reasonable
professional
judgment
supports
the
limitation
on
investigation.
that's
the
rule.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
but
there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
this
case
and
bell
v.
cone,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
it's
this.
bell
v.
cone
was
not
a
case
about
the
failure
to
investigate.
that
was
purely
a
case
about
counsel's
decisions
about
what
information
to
present
to
the
sentencer
after
having
done
what
was
indisputably
a
thorough
investigation.
and
the
reason
that's
critical
is
because
as...
as
we
read
strickland,
the
whole
point
of
the
deference
given
to
counsel's
choices
about
what
to
present
is
premised
on
the
adequacy
of
the
investigation
that
precedes
them.
that
is
what
the
source
of
the
deferential
stance
towards
presentation
is.
it's
the
adequacy
of
investigation.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
this
case
is
about
both,
but
it's
principally
about--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
disagree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
here's
how.
there...
there
are
two
absolutely
compelling
reasons,
but
before
i
get
to
them,
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
very
next
thing
that
the
lawyer
says
in
that
colloquy.
and
the
very
next
thing
the
lawyer
says
is,
well,
yes,
at
least
i
knew
what
was
reported
in
other
people's
reports.
and
that
is
what
led
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
to
the
conclusion
it
reached,
which
was
that
the
social
service
records
and
the
pre-sentence
records,
other
people's
reports,
contained
that
information,
and
we
have
shown
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
they
do
not.
but
there
are
two
additional
points
that
are
critical
here,
and
the
first
one
is
this.
the
trier
of
fact,
the
actual
judge
who
heard
that
testimony--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
that
is
not
how
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--maryland
court
of
appeals
read
it.
it
is
not
how
the
fourth
circuit
read
it.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but...
but,
justice
scalia,
what
matters
here
for
aedpa
purposes
under
(d)(2)
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
based
its
determination
on
an
unreasonable
factual
finding,
and
there
are
two...
there
are
two
critical
indicia
here
that
it
did.
the
first
one...
the
first
one
is
this.
well,
there
are
three.
first,
the
records
don't
contain
the
information.
second,
the
trier
of
fact,
the
judge
who
heard
this
testimony,
concluded...
and
this
is
at
page
605
and
606
of
the
joint
appendix...
that
mr.
schlaich,
the
lawyer
who
gave
that
testimony,
did
not
know
what
was
in
the
social...
what
was
in
the
social
history
subsequently
prepared.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
in
the
state
habeas
proceeding,
your
honor.
his...
at
the
conclusion
of
his
testimony
and
during
closing
argument
by
the...
by
the
government
in
that
state
habeas
proceeding,
the...
the
trier
of
fact
who
heard
the
testimony,
could
assess
demeanor,
could
assess
credibility,
heard
all
the
other
evidence,
saw
all
the
other
evidence,
concluded
that
he
didn't
know
and
found
it
was
error.
and
then...
and
the
next
point
that
we
think
conclusively
demonstrates
that...
that
the
lawyers
did
not
know
is
this.
remember
that...
that
at
the
close
of
the
sentencing
proceeding,
not
the
post-conviction
proceeding,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
actual
sentencing
proceeding,
counsel
for
wiggins
made
a
proffer
of
what
mitigating
evidence
they
would
have
submitted
to
the
sentencing
jury
had
their
motion
to
bifurcate
been
granted.
that
proffer
doesn't
mention
any
of
the
mitigating
evidence
that...
that
we
have
shown
in
the
social
history.
it
doesn't
mention
the
terrible
abuse
of
the
first
6
years
of
his
life.
it
doesn't
mention
the
horrible
burning
incident.
it
doesn't
mention
the
sexual
abuse.
it
doesn't
mention
the
homelessness.
there's
no
conceivable
reason
why
counsel
would
have
withheld
all
of
that
information
from
its
proffer
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sentencing
phase
of
the
proceeding
if
counsel
knew
that
and
could--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
there
was--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--pre-sentence.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the...
there
is
a
document
which
the
state
has
lodged
which
indicates
that
there
were
transcripts
of
interviews
with
family
members.
those
aren't
in
the
record,
but
i
think
the
same
exact
analysis,
the
same
exact
inference
has
to
be
drawn.
if
those
had
included
the
kind
of
terrible
descriptions
of...
of
abuse,
it
would
have
shown
up
in
the
psychologist's
report
because,
after
all,
what
that
document
shows
is
the
psychologist
got
those
interviews
and
it
would
have
shown
up
in
the
proffer
because
that
is
the
most--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no.
that's
separate--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
a
separate--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--they
are--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--they
are
not
there.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
justice
breyer,
let
me...
let
me--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--let
me
address--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--let
me
address
that
directly
because
i
think
this
goes
to
the
essence
of
why
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
judgment
was
an
unreasonable
application
of...
of
the
strickland
rule,
and
it's
this.
the
proffer
occurred
in
the
following
context.
counsel
for
wiggins
made
a
motion
to
bifurcate
the
sentencing
proceeding
so
that
they
could
first
retry
the
factual
case
of
eligibility,
and
then
if
they
lost,
they
could
then
put
on
the
full-blown
mitigation
case.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
right.
bifurcation
would
have
first
involved
the
principalship,
and
then
had
principalship
been
established
to
the
jury's
satisfaction,
they
would
have
moved
to
the
issue
of
mitigation.
and
the...
and
the
trial
judge
denied
that
motion.
now,
he
denied
that
motion...
this
is
critical...
on
the
first
day
of
the
sentencing
hearing.
so
up
to
the
first
day
of
the
sentencing
hearing,
kevin
wiggins'
lawyer's
strategy
was
obviously
to
prepare
both
a
principalship
case
and
a
mitigation
case
because
they
made
a
motion
that
was
designed
to
allow
them
to
do
precisely
that.
so
there
is
no
conceivable
justification
for
them
to
have
failed
to
do
everything
a
reasonable
lawyer
would
have
done
to
develop
a
mitigation
case.
and
they...
and
what
the
proffer
shows...
i'm
afraid
the
proffer
cannot,
justice
breyer,
be
explained
on
the
basis
that
your
honor
described
for
this
reason.
the
point
of
the
proffer...
the
point
of
the
proffer
was
to
show
the
judge
and
to
create
a
record
on
appeal
of
what
they
would
have
shown
had
the
bifurcation
been
granted
and
they
could
have
tried
their
mitigation
case.
this
proffer
was
their
mitigation
case.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
what's
critical
in
that
regard
is
what
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
found
because
what
aedpa
requires
deference
to
is
factual
findings
made
by
a
state
court.
and
what
the...
and
the
factual
finding
that
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
found...
made
is
on
page
121
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
in
the...
in
the
second
paragraph
there.
it...
it
says,
counsel
was
indeed
aware
of
wiggins'
unfortunate
background.
they
had
available
to
them
not
only
the
pre-sentence
investigation,
but
detailed
social
service
records
documenting
sexual
abuse
and
physical
abuse.
that
is
the
sum
and
substance,
the
total,
of
what
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
said
in
terms
of
the
facts
here.
it's
the
sole
factual
finding.
that
factual
finding--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
said--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--they...
the
factual...
the
only
factual
finding
they
made...
the
only...
the
only...
the
only
thing
that
supports
and
explicates
the
general
statement
at
the
outset
of
that
paragraph
that
they
were
aware
of
his
unfortunate
childhood
is
the
specific
factual
finding
that
the
social
service
records
documented
sexual
abuse
and
documented
physical
abuse.
we've
shown
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
that
finding
is
wrong.
and
then
under
(d)(2)
in
aedpa
the
question
is
whether
the
maryland
court
of
appeals'
judgment
was...
was
based
on
an...
an
unreasonable
factual
determination.
and
we've
shown
that
the
only
thing
that
they
found--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
i
disagree.
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
reasonable
reading
of
what
the
trial
judge
held.
what
the
trial--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--the
trial--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--the
trial
judge
said
that
he
was
concluding
that
it
was
error
not
to
investigate.
if
they
knew
the
information,
it
wouldn't
have
been
error
not
to
investigate
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--with
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--with
all
due
respect--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
the
very
sentence
that
you
pointed
to
said,
based
on
the
evidence
that
i
have
seen,
i'm
concluding
it
was
error
for
them
not
to
investigate
it.
if
they
knew
the
information,
he
never
would
have
reached
that
conclusion.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
that's
completely
supported
by
the
proffer.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
excuse
me.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
that's
implicit,
justice
scalia,
in
his
conclusion
that
it
was
error
not
to
investigate,
and
i
think
it's
completely
confirmed
by
the
proffer
which
didn't
include
any
of
this
information
and
for
which
there
would
have
been
absolutely
no
explanation
for
its
exclusion.
absolutely
none
whatsoever.
so
i
think
with
respect
to
the...
to
the
factual
finding
that
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
made,
that
the
social
services
records
documented
abuse
and
provided
the
source
of
his
knowledge,
that's
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
i'm
going
to
answer
your
honor's
question
directly,
but
i...
i
need
a
minute
to
do
it.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
question
under
strickland,
it
seems
to
us,
is
that
once
you've
concluded
that
there
was
a
failure
to
investigate
adequately,
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
outcome
would
have
been
different
as
a
result
of
that
failure.
and
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me,
that
means
that
what
we...
and
strickland
also
stresses
that
that
is
an
objective
test.
that
is
not
based
on
the
idiosyncracies
of
the
individual
decision
makers.
it's
an
objective
analysis.
and
so
the
question
here
is
whether
had
this
information
been
investigated,
if
it
was
in
the
hands
of
competent
counsel,
is
there
a
reasonable
probability
that
competent
counsel
would
have
used
it
and
introduced
it,
and
then
is
there
a
reasonable
probability
that
it
would
have
affected
the
sentencing
jury's
outcome.
and
the
second
half
of
that
analysis,
it
seems
to
us,
is
answered
a
fortiori
by
williams
against
taylor.
the
first
half
of
that
analysis
seems
to
us
clearly
to
support
relief
here
because,
as
i
take
your
honor's
question,
it's
a
question
of,
well,
there
might
be
a
justification
for
not
submitting
this
evidence
to
the
jury.
yes,
there
might.
we
think
in
a
case
like
this
one,
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
choice
not
to
do
so
because
this
evidence
has
so
little
of
what
this
court
has
described
in
other
cases
like
burger
and
darden
as
a
sharp
double
edge,
and
it
is
so
powerfully
mitigating
that
we
don't
think
it
would
have
that
effect.
but
we...
we
respectfully
suggest
that's
not
the
relevant
question.
once
you've
established
deficient
performance
with
respect
to
investigation,
then
we
shift
to
the
prejudice
inquiry,
and
it's
an
objective
analysis.
and
so
long
as
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
competent
counsel
would
have
used
this
information
in
combination
with
the
case
that
they
made,
then...
and
there's
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
outcome
would
have
been
affected,
which
i
think
williams
v.
taylor
establishes
for
us,
then
we
have
shown
what
we
need
to
show
to
be
entitled
to
relief.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think,
if
i
may
just
draw
from
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
with
respect
to
that.
if
there's
an
obvious
failure
on
the
part
of
the
state
court
to
consider
the
totality
of
the
record,
that's
an
unreasonable
application
with
respect
to
prejudice.
and
with...
in
williams,
of
course,
as
your
honor's
dissenting
opinion
pointed
out,
there
was
a
much
more
severe
case
of
aggravating
information
than
here.
williams
had
a
terrible,
long
record
of
violence.
wiggins
has
none.
and
the
mitigating
evidence
here
is
even
stronger
than
the
mitigating
evidence
that
existed
in
the
williams
case.
and
so
we
think
it
follows
directly
from
williams
that...
that
if
you
look
at
whether
there's
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
outcome
would
have
been
different
here
on
the
basis
of
submitting
this
evidence,
that
we
think
that's
a
very
clear
and
easy
case
under
the
standards
that
williams
sets.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the...
factually,
justice
kennedy,
it's
the
latter.
the...
he
ruled
on
the
bifurcation
motion
at
the
outset
of
the...
of
the
trial.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
at
the
time
it
was,
and
the
reason
it
was,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
because
sometime
shortly
before
this
case
was
tried
in
baltimore
county,
another
baltimore
county
judge
had
allowed
such
a
motion.
and
we
think
that
fact
reinforces
the
utterly
unreasonable
character
of
the
failure
to
investigate
here.
these
lawyers
had
a...
had...
had
to
think
there
was
a
reasonable
prospect
they
were
going
to
be
able
to
put
on
a
mitigation
case,
but
we
know
that
all
they
had
to
put
on
that
mitigation
case
was
the
psychologist's
testing.
and
after
all,
that...
all
that
psychologist
did
was
test.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
but
that...
the
point
of
bifurcation
was
to
do
principalship
first,
and
if
they
prevailed
on
principalship,
they
wouldn't
go
to
the
second
phase.
and
only
if
they
didn't
prevail
on
principalship
would
they
go
to
the
second
phase
where
they
wouldn't
have
any
of
the
tactical
cross
currents
they
were
worried
about
because
principalship
was
already
established
and
they
could
go
whole
hog
and
make
the
fullest
mitigation
case
possible.
and
the
fact
that
they
were...
that
they
were
endeavoring
to
follow
that
strategy
until
the
first
day
of
the
sentencing
hearing,
october
11th,
1989,
shows
that
they
didn't...
that
all
they
had
as
of
october
11,
1989,
was
the
psychologist's
report...
shows
that
they
did
not
investigate
at
the
level
that
strickland
requires.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
they
were...
the...
the...
there
are
two
things
that
are
important
about
the
psychologist's
report:
one,
what
it
does
contain;
the
other,
what
it
doesn't
contain.
the
psychologist
was
commissioned
in
this
case
to
do
testing
of
mr.
wiggins,
intelligence
testing
and
then
psychological
profiling,
mmpi-type
testing.
the
evidence
is
undisputed
about
that.
that's
what
the
psychologist
did.
the
thing
that's
significant
about
what
was
discovered
was
the
fact
that
mr.
wiggins
was
of
borderline
intelligence,
which
seems
to
us
quite
relevant
and
entirely
consistent...
it
would
have
been
entirely
consistent,
even
absent
bifurcation,
to
use
that
evidence,
in
addition
to
an
effort
to
disprove
principalship,
because
the
borderline
intelligence
would
easily
and
strongly
have
supported
the
conclusion
that
mr.
wiggins
was
an
accomplice
and
not
a
principal.
but
the
thing
it
doesn't
show
is
any
of
the
history
of
abuse,
and
that's
because
the
psychologist
wasn't
commissioned
to
do
that.
they
didn't
do
what
they
needed
to
do
here,
which
was
to
do
the
social
history.
the
evidence
is
clear
that
it
was
routine
practice
in
these
public
defenders'
office
to
do
the
social
history.
they
admitted
that.
the
evidence
is
clear...
and
the...
and
the
public
defenders
admitted
it...
that
funds
were
available
for
that
purpose.
they
just
didn't
do
it.
they
just
dropped
the
ball
on
this.
they
didn't
do
what
all
the
lawyers
in
their
office
did
routinely,
and
they
didn't
do
what
the
state
post-conviction
trial
judge
said
he
had
never
seen
not
done,
which
is
prepare
this
social
history
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--there
is
not.
there
is
not,
but
it
wouldn't
be
a
surprise,
justice
souter,
that
even
if
an
interview
like
that
occurred,
that
the
defendant
would
not
have
revealed
it,
that...
it's
very
difficult
to
get
this
kind
of
history
of
horrible
personal
abuse
out
of
a
defendant.
it
very
often
requires
a
professional
to
do
it.
that
is
why...
that's
the
very
reason
why
the
social
workers
are
brought
in
to
do
the
kinds
of
social
histories
as
a...
as
a
routine
matter.
and
it
wasn't
done
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
clarify
the...
the
facts
surrounding
the
proffer
because
it's
very
important
to
understand
how
this
unfolded.
counsel
for
wiggins
made
a
motion.
that
motion
was
argued
on
october
11th,
1989
and
denied
at
that
time,
the
first
day
of
the
sentencing
hearing.
but
the
proffer
was
not
made
at
that
time.
what...
what
counsel
for
my
friend,
the
united
states,
described
was
what
mr.
schlaich
he
would
proffer
if
he
had
to
proffer.
he
made
the
actual
proffer
at
the
end
of
the
sentencing
proceeding,
and
it
can
be
found
at
pages,
i
think,
349
to
51
of
the...
348
to
51
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
there's
a
lengthy
proffer
there
of
what
he
would
have
shown
had
he
been
able
to
put
on
his
mitigation
case
in
the...
in
the
method
he
wanted
to.
so--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--he's
making
a
record
for--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--he's
making
a
record
for
appeal,
justice
kennedy.
here's
the...
here's
what
we
would
have
suffered
because
we
wouldn't
have
been...
we
weren't
able
to
put
on
all
of
this
mitigating
evidence,
and
here
it
is.
and
so
the
sum
total
of
his
mitigation
case
is
right
there
on
the
pages.
he's
described
what
it
is
and
it
contains
nothing
about
the
horrible
abuse
that
this
boy
suffered.
nothing.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whose
responsibility
it
was,
i
think
it
is
correct
to
focus
on
the...
the
colloquy
on
page
485
of
the...
of
the
joint
appendix,
but
the
question
asked
mr.
schlaich
there,
as
justice
stevens'
question
suggested,
was,
well,
he
first
says,
well,
it
was
ms.
nethercott's
job
to
develop
mitigation.
and
then
the
question
put
to
him
is
what
guidance
did
you
give
her,
obviously,
about
how
to
develop
the
mitigation
case.
and
he
says,
well,
what
we
decided
to
do
was
retry
the
factual
case.
that's
the...
that's
what
he
says
he
gave
as
guidance
with
respect
to
developing
the
mitigation
case.
so
it's...
it's
completely
clear
that
this
was
neglect.
they
just
dropped
the
ball.
now,
with
respect
to
what
they
actually
did
at
the
sentencing
proceeding,
picking
up
on
justice
o'connor's
questions,
i
think
this
is
critical
as
well.
remember,
strickland
says
no
hindsight,
but
that's
an
argument
that
works
against
the
government
in
this
case
because
what
these
lawyers
actually
did
was,
in
opening
statement,
invite
the
jury
specifically
to
consider
not
only
the
facts
of
the
crime
but,
quote,
who
this
person
is,
said
they
would
hear
he
had
a
difficult
life.
and
then
they
didn't
deliver
on
that
promise.
but
not
only
that,
dr.
johnson,
the...
the
criminologist,
got
up
and
testified,
well,
yes,
violent
people
do
tend
to
adjust
well
in
prison.
well,
that's
not
focusing
on
principalship.
that,
once
again,
is
inviting
the
jury
beyond
principalship
into
the
mitigation
inquiry
and
giving
them
some
reason
to...
to
mitigate,
but
of
course,
omitting
all
of
the
extraordinarily
powerful
reasons
to
mitigate
that
the
social
history
shows.
and
then
third,
there
was
as
a
matter
of
law
in
maryland
a
pre-sentence
report
that
had
to
go
to
the
jury.
and
there
was
nothing
that
wiggins'
lawyers
could
do
to
stop
that.
and
that
pre-sentence
report
gave
a
highly
misleading
and
negative
portrayal
of
wiggins'
background.
and
the...
what...
effect
of
what
these
lawyers
did
was
to
leave
that
unrebutted,
further
damaging
wiggins'
prospects,
further
ensuring
that
he
was
going
to
get
a
death
sentence.
now,
if
i
could
conclude
by
just
reminding
this
court
that
very
recently
in
the
miller-el
case,
this
court
said
even
in
the
context
of
federal
habeas,
the
deferential
review
of
federal
habeas,
there's
a
difference
between
deference
and
abdication.
and
what
my
friends
on
the
other
side
are
asking
for
here
is
the
latter.
they
are
asking
for
abdication.
they
are
asking
this
court
to
uphold
a
judgment
even
though
the
only
factual
finding
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
made
was
wrong
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
even
though
that
proffer
demonstrates
that
wiggins'
lawyers
did
not
do
the
work
necessary
and
did
not
know
the
powerful
mitigation
case
that
could
have
been
made
to
save
this
man's
life.
thank
you.
