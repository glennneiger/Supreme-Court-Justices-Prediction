justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
get
one
thing
straight
on
the...
the
long
footnote
that
you
quote.
they
end
up
saying,
you
knew
all
this
and
you
did
not
get
a
social
history.
do
you
think
it
was...
a
competent
counsel
would
have
gotten
a
social
history
or
not
knowing
what
he
said
he
knew?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is...
is
the
way
that
counsel
says
it
should
have
been
done
the
way
that
lawyers
typically
do
it
in...
in
maryland?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they're
wrong
to
tell
us
that
they
normally
use
social
workers.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was...
his
representation
was
that
this
case
is
unique
because
every
other
member
of
the
defense
bar
routinely
gets
the
social
history.
are
you...
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
didn't
use
any
of
these.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
didn't
use
any
of
those.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
your
view
on
page
137a
of
the
transcript,
all
of
those
matters
are
comprehended
in
this
question
and
this
answer
toward
maybe...
10
lines
from
the
top.
you
also
knew
that
there
were
reports
of
sexual
abuse
at
one
of
his
foster
homes?
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
term...
the
word
reports
there
means
that
he
relied
on
things
other
than
that
are
in
the
lodging.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
puzzled
about
another
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
those
reports
refer
to
sexual
abuse?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
those
reports
refer
to
sexual
abuse?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
still
puzzled.
were
there
any
written
reports
available
to
the
lawyer
that
referred
to
sexual
abuse
that
we
know
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
when
he
said
you
know
that
there
were
reports
of
sexual
abuse
at
one
of
his
foster
homes,
he
was
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
oh.
i
see
what
you're
saying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that...
that
word
reports
does
not
mean
written
reports.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bair,
may
i
ask?
did
counsel
during
the...
the
sentencing
hearing
come
up
with
a
theory
as
to
what
happened
other
than
that
his
client
was
the
killer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand...
but
did
he...
did
he
suggest
who
they
might
have
belonged
to?
did
he
come
up
with
a
theory
as
to
who--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--he
didn't
suggest
that
the
man
who
lived
downstairs
might
have
been
involved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
all
goes
to
explain
why
they
wouldn't
have
put
it
in,
but
why
didn't
they
put
any
of
this
in
the
proffer
at
the...
to
the
judge
at
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
where...
the
page
you
refer
to,
he
says,
when
asked
what
he
did
in...
in
mitigation,
he
said,
well,
basically
what
we
did
in
mitigation
was
attempt
to
retry
the
factual
case
and
try
to
convince
the
jury
on
the
principalship
issue.
that
doesn't
sound
like
the
kind
of
mitigation
we're
talking
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
part
of
the
transcript
certainly
doesn't
support
that
proposition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
part
you
called
our
attention--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
right.
so
this
part
does
not
support
the...
the
proposition
that
he
did
any
mitigating
research
himself
or
with
the
other
person.
he's
talking
about
the
principalship
issue.
