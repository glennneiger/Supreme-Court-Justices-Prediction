mr.
verrilli,
is...
is
there
any
evidence,
one
way
or
the
other,
as
to
whether
defense
counsel
simply
sat
down
with
the
defendant
and
said,
tell
us
about
your
background
and
what
has
happened
to
you
in
your
life?
is
there
any
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
about
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
he
had
been
in
a
position
to
make
a
strong
proffer,
why
wouldn't
he
have
made
it?
his
case
for
a
bifurcated
hearing
would
have
been
stronger
if
he
had
had
a
strong
proffer.
wouldn't
it
have
been?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
