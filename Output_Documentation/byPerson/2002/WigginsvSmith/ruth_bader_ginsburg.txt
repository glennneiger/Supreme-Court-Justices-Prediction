mr.
verrilli,
you
said
absolutely
no
reason
why
it
wouldn't
come
in
if
they
had
it.
why
couldn't
counsel
for
the
defense
think
if
we
introduce
this,
it's
going
to
be
subject
to
cross
examination?
and
if
we
look
at
that
social
history,
we
find
out
that
the
whole
thing
is...
the
defendant
himself
was
the
source
of
the
information
about
the
horrible
sexual
abuse
he
had
been
exposed
to
as
a
child.
the
jury
might
find
that
a
person
who
had
been
so
abused
would
be
full
of
hate
and
therefore
very
likely
would
have
had
the
mental
state
to
carry
out
this
brutal
murder
that...
in
other
words,
that
this
kind
of
information
could
be
a
two-edged
sword.
the
jury
could
infer
from
it
he's
not
fully
responsible
for
his
acts
or,
on
the
other
hand,
that
this
person
was
violent,
full
of
hate,
and
indeed
committed
this
brutal
murder.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
himmelfarb,
in
that
connection,
there's
something
i'd
like
you
to
set
me
straight
on.
there
was
a
statement
at
some
point
that
each
of
the
defense
counsel
thought
the
other
was
going
to
bear
the
laboring
awe
in
working
up
the
mitigation
case.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
each
one
thought
the
other
was
doing
it
and
the
other
wasn't
doing
it.
that
would
be
ineffective
representation
if
each
one
thought
the
other
was
investigating
and
it
turned
out
neither
investigated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
where...
where
do
i
get
that
notion
from
that
each
one
thought
the
other
was
principally
responsible
for
working
up
the
mitigation
case?
