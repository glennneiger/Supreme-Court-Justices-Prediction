about

what
does

turn

justice
sandra

--well,
obviously,
the...
the
defense
counsel
didn't
know
until
the
motion
was
made
and
ruled
upon
for
a
bifurcated
hearing
whether
the
judge
would
grant
it,
and
there's
no
reason
presumably
that
defense

should
not
have
investigated
the
mitigating

pending
that
ruling.

and
yet,
we
don't
have
a

understanding

what

and
in

did
not
defense

tell
the
jury
for

that
they
would
be
hearing
evidence
about
the
defendant's
background--
justice

then
nothing

on.

i

what...
what
is
the

to
make

it's
so
odd.

presumably
the...
the
determination

was
made
in

when

guilty

innocent,

so
to
try

wiggins
versus
smith
which
comes
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
in
1989,
the
petitioner,
kevin
wiggins
was
convicted
of
capital
murder
by
a
maryland
judge
and
was
sentenced
to
death
by
a
jury.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
represented
by
new
counsel,
petitioner
sought
state
post
conviction
relief
arguing
that
trial
counsel
had
rendered
ineffective
assistance
by
failing
to
investigate
and
present
mitigating
evidence
of
his
troubled
childhood.
to
support
his
claim
that
petitioner
presented
testimony
by
a
social
worker
who
discussed
petitioner's
long
history
of
privation
and
physical
as
well
as
sexual
abuse.
the
state
court
denied
the
petitioner
relief.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
emphasized
that
counsel
did
investigate
petitioner's
childhood
concluding
that
counsel
had
made
a
legitimate
tactical
decision
to
challenge
petitioner's
direct
responsibility
for
the
murder
rather
than
to
present
the
mitigation
case.
petitioner
then
sought
habeas
relief
in
federal
district
court.
the
federal
court
granted
the
writ
but
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed,
concluding
that
counsel
had
made
a
reasonable
strategic
decision.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit.
to
prevail
on
an
ineffective
assistance
claim,
the
petitioner
must
show
that
counsel's
performance
fell
below
an
objective
standard
of
reasonableness
and
that
the
deficiency
prejudice
his
defense.
our
principal
concern
in
evaluating
petitioner's
claim
is
not
whether
a
counsel
should
have
presented
a
mitigation
case,
but
whether
the
investigation
that
counsel
directed
supporting
that
decision,
not
to
introduce
mitigating
evidence
was
itself
reasonable.
in
our
review
of
petitioner's
claim
as
circumscribed
by
the
requirements
of
28
united
states
code
section
2254,
which
authorizes
federal
courts
to
grant
habeas
relief
only
if
a
state
court
decision
was
contrary
to
or
involved
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law.
counsels
investigation
of
petitioner's
life
history
fell
below
the
performance
standard
set
by
strickland
versus
washington.
counsel's
investigation
consisted
of
two
sources
that
contained
only
a
fraction
of
the
mitigating
evidence
revealed
during
state
post
conviction
proceeding,
a
pre-sentence
investigation
report
and
a
state
social
services
record.
counsel's
decision
to
end
their
investigation
with
these
sources
was
neither
consistent
with
the
professional
standards
that
prevailed
in
1989,
nor
reasonable
in
light
of
the
evidence
contained
in
the
records.
evidence
that
would
have
led
a
reasonably
competent
attorney
to
investigate
further.
in
assuming
that
counsel's
investigation
met
strickland
standards
and
in
deferring
that
counsel's
strategic
decision
despite
the
unreasonable
underlying
investigation,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
unreasonably
applied
strickland.
section
2254(d)
therefore
poses
no
bar
to
the
relief.
given
the
nature
in
the
extent
of
the
available
mitigating
evidence,
we
also
find
that
counsel's
deficient
performance,
prejudiced
petitioner's
defense.
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
a
competent
attorney
aware
of
this
evidence
would
have
introduced
it
at
sentencing
in
an
admissible
form.
moreover,
had
the
jury
been
able
to
place
petitioner's
bleak
history
on
the
mitigating
side
of
the
scale,
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
at
least
one
juror
would
have
struck
a
different
balance.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
