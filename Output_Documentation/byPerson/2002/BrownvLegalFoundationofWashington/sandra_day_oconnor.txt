mr.
fried,
what
plaintiffs
have
standing
to
ask
for
injunctive
relief
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
the...
in
the
complaint
was
an
injunction
sought
on
behalf
of
brown
and
hayes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i...
i
thought
it
read
to
the
contrary,
that
it
was
on
behalf
of
the
lpos.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
and
you
ask
for
it
now
on
behalf
of
brown
and
hayes,
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
behalf
of
the
foundation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
if...
if
it
is
shown...
and
i
guess
we
don't
know
here
because
it
hasn't
been
determined.
if
it
is
shown
that
no
compensation
is
due
because
it
wouldn't
have
earned
or
produced
anything,
then
how
is
it
a
taking?
i
mean,
that's...
because
the
takings
clause
refers
to
the
taking
without
just
compensation.
if
the
compensation
is
0,
how
is
it
a
taking?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if.
if
it
were,
how...
how
is
it
a
taking?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then
what
is
your
answer?
is
it
a
taking
if
the
just
compensation
is
0?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
is
it
in...
in
the
language
of
the
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
has
not
been
determined,
has
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
burman,
let
me
ask
you
something
as
a
practical
matter.
if
the
court
disagreed
with
you
and
concluded
there
was
a
taking
and
they
were
entitled
to
some
relief,
can
the
problem
be
solved
by
simply
adding
a
little
explanatory
provision
in
the
proposed
escrow
instructions,
that
if
you
don't
want
your
money
in
the
combined
account,
you
can
do
something
else
with
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
otherwise,
it's
going
in
the
iolta
account.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
would
become
taxable
to
the
person
opting
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
to
everybody
else.
if
the...
if...
if
the
person
entering
into
the
escrow
says,
having
understood
it,
look,
if
i
opt
out,
i'm
not
going
to
get
anything,
so
i
don't
care,
you
can
do
this,
would...
could
it
still
function?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
choice
did
the
plaintiffs
have
in
going
into
this
arrangement
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
they
wanted
to
engage
in
the
real
estate
transaction,
did
they
have
another
choice?
