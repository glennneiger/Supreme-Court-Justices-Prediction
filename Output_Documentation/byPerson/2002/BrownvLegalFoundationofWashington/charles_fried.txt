mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
wish
to
argue
four
propositions.
first,
that
the
interest
in
these
iolta
accounts
is
the
private
property
of
brown
and
hayes,
the
clients.
second,
that
it
was
not
regulated;
it
was
taken.
third,
that
it
has
value.
and
fourth,
that
an
injunction
or
declaratory
relief
is
an
appropriate
and
practicable
form
of
relief
in
this
case.
now--
mr.
charles
fried
--no.
i
think
we
are
entitled
to
a
declaration,
or
to
an...
or
an
injunction
just
as
was
received
in
eastern...
in
eastern
enterprises,
just
as
was
received
in
hodel
v.
irving,
just
as
was
received
in
nollan
and
dolan.
and
in
our...
in
our
complaint
filed,
we
asked
for
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief,
so
i
think
that
is
available,
and
it
is
a
practical
and
proper
form
of
relief
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
fried
how...
how
far,
justice
stevens?
mr.
charles
fried
they
did
not
go
that
far.
they...
no,
they
did
not.
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
if
the
injunctive
relief,
which
we
asked
for...
and
here
in
the...
the
complaint,
i
believe,
is
on
page
100
of
the...
100
of
the
joint
appendix.
i
think
it's
on...
no,
i'm
sorry.
it's...
yes,
in
the...
in
the
joint
appendix.
we
ask
specifically
for
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
in
general.
now--
mr.
charles
fried
--certainly
brown
and
hayes.
there's
a
question
whether
daugs
and
maxwell
do,
but
certain--
mr.
charles
fried
--yes.
an
injunction
was
sought
in
general.
a
general
injunction
was
sought.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
putting
my
hand
on
the...
on
the
section
in
the
complaint,
but--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
was
on
behalf
of
the
lpos,
but
then
finally...
yes.
now
i
have
it.
thank
you.
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
30,
we
ask
specifically
that
they
permanently
enjoin
the
defendants.
this
is
paragraph
3.
so
we
asked
for
that
relief,
yes.
mr.
charles
fried
we
certainly
do.
mr.
charles
fried
we...
we
ask
for
it
on
behalf
of
any
and
all
parties
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
fried
we
are
asking
for
more
than
the
dissenters
would
have
given
us.
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
charles
fried
yes.
we
are
asking
for
more
than
that.
we
are
asking
for
it
because
it's
very
clear
on
this
court's
precedents
that
where
compensatory
relief
would
be
impracticable,
or
is
not
contemplated
in
the
program,
an
injunction
is...
is
proper.
and
this
court
has
on
numerous
occasions
in
very
similar
cases
granted
injunctive
relief.
mr.
charles
fried
it's
been
presented
throughout,
justice
ginsburg,
and
in
fact,
in
the
fifth
circuit
case,
which
is
virtually
identical
to
this
case,
not
only
was
it
presented,
but
an
injunction
was
granted.
and
exactly
the
injunction
which
we
received--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
think
that
the...
i
submit,
justice
ginsburg,
that
that
paragraph,
which
i
have
read
to
you,
makes
that
clear.
mr.
charles
fried
and
in
the
summary...
and
i'm...
i'm
informed
that
it
was
also
made
clear
in
our
summary
judgment
motion.
so
that
the
courts
were
well
aware,
as
the
complaint
should
have
made
them
aware,
but
also
were
well
aware
that
we
were
seeking
an
injunction
for
all
parties
in
all
respects.
and
after
all,
that
is
precisely
the
relief
that
was
obtained
in
the
fifth
circuit
case.
mr.
charles
fried
they--
mr.
charles
fried
--the...
i
think
that's
exactly
the
reason.
if
there
were
an...
if
there
is
compensation
in
this
case,
exactly
as
the
court
said
in
eastern
enterprises,
it
would...
in
effect,
compensation
being
dollar-for-dollar
is
the
equivalent
of
shutting
down
the
program.
and
that
was
the
case
in
webb's
as
well.
i...
i
might
just
mention,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
respondents
throughout
this
case
say
that
the
eastern
enterprises
case,
which
is
very
important
to
our
injunctive
claim,
was
really
only
a
plurality.
there
was
not
a
majority
for
the
court.
i
don't
believe
that
the
fifth
justice,
which
was
yourself,
disagreed
with
the
remedy.
and
indeed,
the
fifth
justice
said
that
this
was
not
a
takings
case...
eastern
enterprise...
because
unlike
this
very
case
we
have,
this
was
not
the...
the...
you
said,
rather
the
exaction
is
a
forced
contribution
to
general
government
revenues.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
reading
the
wrong...
i'm
reading
the
wrong
passage.
in
the
eastern...
eastern
enterprises
case,
you
said
that
the
reason...
the
reason
that
you
didn't
think
that
was
a
takings
case
was
that
a
valuable
interest
in
an
intangible
or
even
a
bank
account
or
accrued
interest,
which
is,
of
course,
this
case,
had
not
been
appropriated.
well,
this
is
a
bank
account
and
a
crude
interest--
mr.
charles
fried
--yes.
mr.
charles
fried
my...
our
case
is
different
because
in
this
case,
as
in
webb's,
as
in
eastern
associates,
to
give
compensation
is
to
simply
erase
the
program.
while
in
the
case
where
physical
property
is
taken,
to
give
compensation
still
leaves
it
open
to
use
that
property
while...
where
what
you
have
is
money
and
you
must
make
compensation
for
that,
then
to
make
compensation
for
a
dollar
is
to
pay
a
dollar.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
eastern
enterprises.
mr.
charles
fried
that
would
be
correct
if
webb's
had
been
a
due
process
case,
but
it
was
not.
it
was
a
takings
case.
and
in
webb's,
they
didn't
say
you
can
take
that
interest
so
long
as
you
pay
just
compensation
for
it.
they
say,
you've
got
to
stop.
mr.
charles
fried
that
it
makes
no
sense.
it's
not
that
it's
hard
to
calculate.
we
would
be
happy
to
argue
how
you
would
calculate
it.
the
point
is
that
to
calculate
it
and
to
pay
the
just
compensation
is
to
shut
down
the
program.
it
makes
no
sense.
there's
no
program
left
after
you
have
paid
just
compensation.
mr.
charles
fried
the
compensation
is
not
0,
and
the
premise
of
the--
mr.
charles
fried
--if
it
were.
but
the--
mr.
charles
fried
--yes.
it
is
a
taking,
but
it
is...
as
the...
because
this
court--
mr.
charles
fried
--because
this
court
in
phillips
has
held
that
economic...
that...
that
there
is
private
property
and
it
has
value
even
though
it
has
no
realizable
economic
value.
but
we
do
not
concede
that
there
is
no
economic
value
here,
and
the
fact
that
it
could
not
have
earned
interest--
mr.
charles
fried
--yes,
it
has.
it
has
been
determined.
it
has
been
determined
and
conceded
by
the
respondents
that
there
is
interest
in
this
case
of
$5
and
$2.
they
go
on
to
argue,
ah,
yes,
but
absent
the
iolta
program,
that
would
not
have
been
earned.
this
court
in
webb's
specifically
addressed
that
point
and
said,
we
accept
the
proposition
that
apart
from
the
statute,
florida
law
does
not
require
that
interest
be...
be
earned
on
registered
deposits.
so
it
was
quite
clear.
this
is
just
another
version
of--
mr.
charles
fried
--those
are
gross
figures,
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
fried
perhaps
and
perhaps
not.
let's
say
that
there
has
not.
i...
we
argue
that
that
does
not
matter.
it
is
the
gross...
it
is
the
gross
interest
that
is
in...
involved
here--
mr.
charles
fried
--and
that
is
the
point--
mr.
charles
fried
--no.
we
would
get
the
gross
loss.
i
think
the--
mr.
charles
fried
--that
is
what
the
dissent
says.
we
do
not
agree
with
that.
what
we
agree
with
is
what
this
court
said
in
phillips
when
this
court
said
that...
and
it
used
the
example
of
the
rents...
the
government
may
not
seize
rents
received
by
the
owner
of
a
building
because
it
can
prove
that
the
costs
incurred
in
collecting
the
rents
exceed
the
amounts
collected.
if
the
argument
that's
being
made
now
were
correct,
then
that
statement
would
be
incorrect
because
it
would
mean--
mr.
charles
fried
--that
the
government
may
seize
those
rents.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
not,
justice...
justice
souter,
because
the
court
in
phillips
said
specifically
this
interest...
so
it
assumes
there
is...
this
interest
is
the
private
property
of
the
clients,
brown
and
hayes.
it
said
that
this
is...
that's
what
this
court
said.
it
is
their
property.
now,
it
doesn't
disappear
as
their
property
because
they
would
incur
expenses
in
collecting
it.
mr.
charles
fried
the...
the
court
certainly
did
not
say
that
any
of
that
interest
could
be
netted
out
and
paid
net
to
brown
and
hayes,
but
it
did
say,
quite
unambiguously,
that
that
interest...
not
in
some
general
sense,
but
exactly
that
interest...
was
the
private
property
of
clients,
brown
and
hayes.
now--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
that's
a...
i
mean,
that
is...
that
is
an
argument
which
depends
on
traversing
the
premise
established
by
this
court
in
webb's
and
phillips.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
that
is
the
argument
that
the
solicitor
general
made
in
phillips,
that
this
is
government-created
property,
and
it
was
rejected.
mr.
charles
fried
and
it
was
rejected
by
this
court.
it
was
rejected.
mr.
charles
fried
it
might
very
well.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
that
is...
that's
one
of
the
points.
mr.
charles
fried
if
i
could
just
address
the
gross-versus-net
point.
the
interest
to
which
we
are
entitled,
to
which
the
clients
are
entitled,
is...
it
was
calculated
by
respondents...
$5
and
$2.
that
is
the
amount
to
which
they
are
entitled.
it
may
well
be
that
along
the
way,
the
accountants
will
say,
fine,
and
we'd
like
$3.50
of
that,
and
the
lawyers
may
say,
fine,
and
we
want
actually
$4
of
that.
and
it
may
well
be
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
don't
have
any
money.
that's
not
any
of
the
government's
business.
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
fried
the
client
has
a
right
to
dispose
of
it,
but...
or
ought
to
have
a
right,
under
the
constitution,
has
a
right
to
dispose
of
it--
mr.
charles
fried
--but
he
will
pay
taxes.
mr.
charles
fried
that's...
that's
life.
mr.
charles
fried
it
may.
it
may
go
back
to
the
bank,
which,
in
a
competitive
industry,
would
presumably
work
its
way
down
to
the...
to
the
clients,
but
i
don't
need
to
make
that
argument.
mr.
charles
fried
it
doesn't
give
the
interest
to
the
bank.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
the--
mr.
charles
fried
--yes.
mr.
charles
fried
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
charles
fried
it
is...
the
client
is
compelled
to
engage
in
it
if
he
wishes
to
buy
and
sell
real
estate.
mr.
charles
fried
he's
not
compelled
to
buy
and
sell
real
estate.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
indeed,
not.
mr.
charles
fried
he
must--
mr.
charles
fried
--he
must
deposit
money
in
the
bank
if
he
wants
to
buy
and
sell
real
estate,
the
way
you
have
to
pay
money
to
a
grocer
if
you
want
to
eat.
if
i
may,
i'd
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
just
a
few
points.
first,
this
is
not
a
revenue
measure.
it
is
not
a
tax.
it
has
never
been
argued
to
be
a
tax.
indeed,
if
it
were
a
tax,
we
would
have
no
complaint.
indeed,
it
is
our
answer
to
the
arguments
made,
the
dog-in-the-manger
argument
that
was
made
in
the
court
below,
and
the
argument
made
by
aarp,
that
if
the
government
wants
our
money,
they
should
get
it
the
old-fashioned
way.
they
should
tax.
now,
the
court
said,
and
aarp
said,
it's
inconvenient
to
tax
because
that
comes
with
strings.
that's
called
democracy.
they
don't
like
the
strings.
and
so
the
bar
association
and
the
justices
wish
to
acquire
the
money.
mr.
charles
fried
no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that
if
they
did
it
as
a--
mr.
charles
fried
--as
a
tax...
if
they
did
it
as
a
tax
because
it--
mr.
charles
fried
--because
in
every
jurisdiction
and
certainly
in
the
federal
government,
taxes
have
to
jump
over
certain
hoops.
there
are
institutional
constraints,
and
it's
exactly
those
constraints
that
the
justices
and
the
bar
associations
want
to
escape.
they
have
told
us
so.
it's
all--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
would
be
an
entirely
different
question.
i
wouldn't
want
to
concede
it,
but
it
would
be
a
different
question,
and
a
harder
one
because
this
court
has
granted
greater
leeway
to
tax,
and
the
reason
it
has
is
because
taxation
is
a
recognized
institutional
form
with
lots
of
institutional
hurdles
that
the
respondents
do
not
wish
to
endure.
they
wish
to
do...
do
an
end
run
around
them.
now,
as
to
the
regulatory
purpose
here,
i
think
it's
sufficient
to
note
that
prior
to
iolta,
there
were
plenty
of
regulations...
both
of
escrow
agents
and
lawyers...
to
prevent
them
from
self-dealing,
and
lawyers
were
disbarred
if
they
violated
them.
this
iolta
measure
was
passed,
and
it
was
passed
only
as
a
way
to
raise
funds
for
legal
services.
so
i
think
that
the
regulatory
purpose
is
an
after-the-fact
invention.
now,
also
we
do
not
say
that
it
is
impossible
to
value
the
taken
here...
the
amounts
taken.
it's
perfectly
possible.
it's
$5
and
$2.
it's
simply
impracticable
to
force
brown
and
hayes
to
sue
for
it.
that's
the
impracticability.
it's
not
impossible.
we
do
not
say
that.
and
that's
why
cases
like
kimball
laundry
are
completely
beside
the
point.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
and
the
solution
for
that
is
the
political
process
rather
than
the
process
of
judges
and
bar
associations
raising
revenue.
and
under
the
political
process,
the
result
you
describe
happens
all
the
time.
it
should
not
happen
here.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
we're
enjoining
it...
we
are
asking
you
to
enjoin
it
because
it
is
an
illegal
program.
the
result
of
the
injunction,
or
a...
a
declaration
would
be
what
you
described.
mr.
charles
fried
no.
i...
i
think
that's--
mr.
charles
fried
--sufficient.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
