justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
fact,
they
specifically
said
this
equitable
relief
would
not
enjoin
takings,
but
would
simply
stop
washington
supreme
court
from
requiring
the
lpo's
to
comply
with
the
iolta
rules.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
fried,
the
question
that
justice
stevens
raised,
which
i
was
then
addressing,
was
not
what
was
in
your
complaint,
but
what
was
the
position
of
the
dissenting
judges
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
i
read
from
that
dissent...
so
you
are
clearly
asking
for
something
that
the
dissenters
did
not
say
you
would
be
entitled
to
when
they
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
they
said
the
equitable
relief
would
not
enjoin
takings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you
mentioned
your
complaint,
and
then
we
have
this
passage
in
the
dissent.
when
did
the
idea
of
an
injunction
of
the
takings...
when
was
that
squarely
presented
to
any
court?
because
it
would
seem
that
if
you
had
presented
it,
that
this
is
rather
curious,
what
we
get
in
the
dissent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
just
could
tell
me
at
what
point
you
made
it
clear
to
the
court
that
you
were
seeking
not
what
is
described
here,
that
is,
that
the...
that
the
injunction
would
be
addressed
to
the
compliance
of
the
lpo's
with
the
iolta
rules.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you
again,
mr.
fried,
are
going
quite
beyond
the
position
of
the
original
panel,
later
the
dissenters
in
the
ninth
circuit,
who
made
it
clear...
and
this
is
on
page
83a
of
the
original
panel
decision...
that
said,
just
as
a
client
is
not
entitled
to
the
full
amount
that
a
lawyer
collects
for
him,
but
only
that
amount
less
the
lawyer's
reasonable
expenses
and
fees,
so
just
compensation
for
the
interest
taken
by
iolta,
after
iolta
causes
the
interest
fund
to
exist,
is
something
less...
is
something
less...
than
the
amount
of
the
interest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that...
that
was
not
the
position
that
any
judge
has
brought
so
far
because
the
original
panel
that
held
in
your
favor
said,
yes...
and
i
don't
want
to
repeat
myself,
but
something
less.
it
would
be
something
less
than
the
amount
of
interest.
i
have
a
question
that...
that's
puzzling
me
about
this
theoretically
we
could
have
it
separate.
i
thought
that
the
program
can
only
work,
as
far
as
the
tax
law
is
concerned,
if
the
client
has
no
control
over
the
disposition
of--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
interest.
if
the
client
has
control,
then
it's
taxable
to
the...
then
it...
interest
like
any
other
interest
would
be
taxable.
so,
here,
the
iolta
has
this
peculiar
aspect
to
it.
you
can
it's
interest
belonging
to
the
client,
but
that
client
has
no
right
to
dispose
of
it
as
long
as
it's
going
to
be
nontaxable
income.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
it
would
be
interest--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
but
that's
another--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--another...
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
a
very
basic
question,
and
it's...
it's
essentially
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
really
takes
it
away
from
the
banks.
and
then
if
you
succeed,
it
goes
back
to
the
bank.
am
i
right
that
that's
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
might
be
some
due
process
claim,
mightn't
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
trying...
what...
what
we're
looking
at
here
is
a
takings
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
burman,
am
i
right?
it's
not
$5
and
$2.
that's
gross.
and
with
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
it?
they're--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not?
because
that
person
would
have
disposition
either
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
in
order
to
have
this
scheme
work,
the
client
cannot
have
any
control
over
the
disposition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
couldn't
do...
you
couldn't
do
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
dellinger,
does...
washington
has
the
same
program
as
in
texas?
that
is,
if
a
mistake
is
made,
and
this
money
could
have
earned
net
interest,
then
you
can
get
a
refund.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
fried,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
that
is
troubling
me
about
this,
in
addition
to
the
question
of
is
it
really
the
bank
whose...
whose
economic
gain
has
been
taken?
but
this
is
a
question
about
the...
the
class
sets
involved.
now,
i
know
this
isn't
a
class
action,
but
the
injunction
is
going
to
be
to
cover
everyone
in
this
group.
and
some
of
them
may
be
outraged
by
this
and
others
may
say,
we'd
much
rather
that
iolta
get
it
than
the
bank.
so
there's
something
troubling
about
an
injunction
that's
going
to
cover
all
of
these
people
who
may
have
very
diverse
views
about
what
they
would
like
to
see
happen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that
answer.
if
the
choice
is
between
the
banks
and
iolta,
and
some
of
the
people
say
we
don't
want
to
prefer
the
bank,
we
want
to
prefer
iolta.
you're...
you're
making
the
choice
for
them
in
saying,
you
have
to
prefer
the
bank
because
we're
enjoining
it.
