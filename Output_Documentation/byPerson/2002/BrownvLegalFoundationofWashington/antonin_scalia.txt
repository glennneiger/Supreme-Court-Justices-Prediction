justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
could
do
it
theoretically,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
computing
the...
the
various
payouts
would...
would
be
so
expensive
that...
and
the
payouts
so
small
that
it's
just
not
practicable.
isn't
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
except
your...
your
client
is
not
compelled
by...
by
those
banking
regulations
to
deposit
any
money
in
the
bank,
is
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think...
i
think
the
point
is
that...
that
your
client
must...
must
be
willing...
what
is
it...
must
deposit
money
in
the
bank
if
he
wants
to
deposit
money
in
the
bank.
that's
the
compulsion
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
must
deposit
money
in
the
bank
if
he
wants
to
deposit
money
in
the
bank.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
again,
i...
$5
and
$2.
it's
not
a
whole
lot
of
money,
but
it's
their
money.
why...
why
do
you
say
it
can't
be
calculated?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're...
there
you're
talking
about
something
that
has
to
be
sold
for
money.
this
is
quite
calculable.
we
know
exactly
how
much
interest
was
paid,
and
we
know
that
that
interest
belonged...
under
our
case
law,
belongs
to
these
plaintiffs.
what...
what
is
the
problem?
$5
and
$2.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
who
has
the
$5
and
$2?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
does...
does
this
mean...
let's...
you
know,
banks
pay
higher...
higher
amounts
for
certain
deposits
above
a
certain
amount.
and
you're
saying
that
if
the
government
passes
a
law
that
says
i
have
to...
i
have
to
deposit
my
$5,000,
together
with
other
people's
$5,000,
thereby
getting
additional
interest
for
all
of
it...
right...
you
can
keep
the
interest
because
i
wouldn't
have
gotten
it
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
a...
what
a
wonderful
scam.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
if
there's...
there's
a
regulatory
purpose
or
not.
i
mean,
that...
that
may
go
to
some
other...
some
other
element,
but
as...
as
to
whether
you've
taken
my
property,
the
interest
was
paid
because
of
my
$5,000,
and
then
you
come
back
and
say,
oh,
yeah,
but
you
wouldn't
have
gotten
that
much
because
you
wouldn't
have
been...
well,
that's
true.
i
wouldn't
have,
but
the
fact
is
i
was
in
with
those
other
people
and
i
did
get
them
more
money,
and
that
more
money
is
mine.
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
you
sure
it's
not
taxable
to
the
person
who
opts
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
--back
to
my
example.
my
example
of
you...
you
compel
a
bunch
of
people
to...
to
contribute
$5,000
apiece.
no
money
lost?
i
could
not
have
made
that...
that
additional...
that
additional
interest
on
the
$5,000.
so
it's
perfectly
okay
for
the
state
to
say,
hey,
you
know,
this...
this
interest
is
ours.
we
made
it
on
your
money,
but
you
couldn't
have
gotten
it
otherwise.
that
seems
to
me
extraordinarily
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
give...
you
give
the
same
answer
to
my
$5,000
hypothetical
that
your...
your
brother
would.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
so
long
as
the
government
sets
it
up
that
way
and
i
couldn't
make
any
more
money,
the
money
that
the
government
makes
on
my
money
is
the
government's.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
the
cases
make
clear
what
you
have
to
deduct
from
it.
what
if...
what
if
it
would
be
clear
that
i
would
have
had
to
have
to
sue
for
it,
and...
and
i
would
have
had
to
expend
attorney's
fees?
does
that
all
have
to
be
deducted
from
the
just
compensation?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
if
you
took
his
right
to
earn
interest.
but
that's
not
what
you
took
here.
you
took
$7.
he
did
earn
interest.
it
was
not
some
abstract
right
to
earn
interest
that
was
taken.
what
was
taken
was
$7.
justice
antonin
scalia
whose
money
earned
the
$7?
justice
antonin
scalia
his
money
earned
it,
didn't
it?
and
didn't
we
say
in
our
earlier
case
that
if
it's
his
money
that
earned
the
interest,
the
interest
belongs
to
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
we
decided
that
issue
in
phillips.
i
mean,
you
could
argue
that
point--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
didn't
we
decide
that
point
in
phillips,
that
there
was
a
taking--
--i
don't
know
if
we
did
that.
i
mean,
property--
--and
that
the
property
did
belong--
justice
antonin
scalia
--somebody's
property
or
the
property
of...
of
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
you
can
have
an
injunction.
justice
antonin
scalia
courts
have
the
power
to
tax?
