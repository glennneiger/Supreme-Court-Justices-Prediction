mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
establish
a
violation
of
the
just
compensation
clause,
let's
remember
there
have
to
be
three
elements.
there
has
to
be
property...
established
by
phillips.
there
has
to
be
a
taking
in
the
constitutional
sense,
and
there
has
to
be
a
denial
by
the
state
of
just
compensation.
mr.
burman
has
suggested
why
that
is
missing
in
this
case
because
there
has
been
no
just
compensation
that's
denied.
the
justices
of
the
washington
supreme--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
kennedy,
it
is
a
taking
when
the
government
takes
your
property
without
a
sufficient
regulatory
basis.
and
the
compensation
they
owe
you,
if
it
is
zero,
and
zero
is
paid,
there
is
no
violation.
i
know
it
is
somewhat
surprising
since
the
founding
generation
was
so
wedded
to
rights
of
property,
but
the
fifth
amendment
expressly
confirms
the
authority
of
government
to
take
property
for
public
purposes,
state,
local,
and
national.
they
have
to
pay
just
compensation.
if
they
take
$1
million
of
your
property
and
pay
you
$999,000,
they've
violated
the
clause.
if
they...
if
your
property
is
worth
$10,
and
they
pay
you
$10,
they
haven't
violated.
and
if
it
loses
$10
in
value,
and
it's
worth
zero,
then
they
owe
you
nothing.
there's
no
denial,
no
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
professor
fried
would
say
in
that
instance,
if
the
value
declines
from
$10
to
zero,
you
enjoin
them
from
taking
it.
that's
not
the
answer.
the
answer
is
that
the
compensation
is
zero.
now,
in
this
case,
by
definition,
as
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington...
insofar
as
the
english
language
would
permit
it...
said
we
do
not
want
to
take
property
that
individuals
could
earn
on
their
own.
they
say
at
page
149
of
the
joint
appendix
from
the
original
iolta
order,
in
adopting
these
amendments
to
the
code
of
professional
responsibility,
we
make
clear
that
those
funds
available
for
the
iolta
program
are
only
those
that
cannot
under
any
circumstances
earn
net
interest.
and
they
even
were
careful
at
page
165
of
the
joint
appendix
to
say
that
as
cost-effective
subaccounting
services
become
available,
making
it
possible
to
earn
net
interest
on
smaller
amounts
for
increasingly
shorter
periods
of
time,
more
trust
money
will
have
to
be
invested
for
a
client's
benefit
under
the
new
rule.
the
rule
is
self-adjusting.
unquote.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
my
answer
is
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes,
because
this
court's
cases
make
it
clear,
justice
scalia,
that
the
amount
of
just
compensation
that
is
due
is
the
amount
of
your
loss.
and
if
your
loss
is
zero,
there's
no
denial
of
just
compensation.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
i
would
not...
i
would
not
count
that
as
all.
the...
the
proper
measure
is
what
a
willing
buyer
would
pay
a
willing
seller.
in
this
instance,
i
think,
it's
the...
what
is
taken
is
the
ability
to
use
one's
money
to
earn
money
for
a
period
of
time.
what
would
a
willing
buyer
pay
for
that?
if
i
have
a
few
thousand
dollars
to
invest
for
72
hours
and
say
to
professor
fried,
you
can
pay
me
for
the
value
of
that...
my
right
to
earn
that
money;
if
he
goes
to
the
bank
and
the
bank
says,
you
can
deposit
here
for
72
hours,
but
when
you
come
back,
you
will
owe
us
money,
he's
going
to
pay
me
zero.
now,
if--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
think
that
is
a
mischaracterization
of
the
facts,
justice
scalia,
that
the
money
that
he
put
in,
if
invested
at
that
rate,
in
a
world
without
transaction
costs,
would
have
earned
that
amount
of
money,
but
that
world
doesn't
exist
in
the...
in
the
milky
way.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
$7--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that's
not
the
case
because
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--precisely,
it's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
exactly
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
breyer,
i
think
the
cases
make
it
clear
that
you
look
to
what
a
willing
buyer
would
pay
a
willing
seller.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
money
that
is...
the
money
that
is
acquired...
taken
in
the
common
language
sense...
comes
from
the
money
that
is
generated
by
the
pool
of
funds.
it's
not
money
that
could
have
been
paid
to
the
individual
client.
and
these
rules
make
it
clear
that
if
you
could
pay
it
to
the
individual
client,
because
you
can't...
you
can't
find
out
who
he
or
she
is,
or
allocate
the
money
to
them.
so
it
has
no
net
value.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
you...
you
did
decide
in
phillips
that
the
interest
was
property,
but
you
have
to
look
to
what
the
value
is.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
is
the...
it
is
the
property
of
the
client,
and
if
there
is
an...
a
way
of
getting
net
interest
to
the
client,
these
rules
require
it.
now,
several
of
the
examples
suggest--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--absolutely
correct.
you...
you
inform
the
iolta
program
that
the
money
could
have
earned
net
interest,
and
if
that's
true,
the
interest
comes
to
you.
now,
several
of
the
examples
were
in
a
sense
more
naked
wealth
transfers.
what's
different
about
this
program...
we've...
we've
addressed
the
fact
that
there's...
this
third
element
of
a
denial
of
just
compensation
is
missing,
but
i
do
want
to
address
the
fact
that
we
don't
believe
that
this
is
a
taking
because
if
you
apply
this
court's
penn
central
analysis,
all
of
the
factors
point
in
the
same
direction,
in
addition
to
the
absence
of
investment-backed
expectations.
this
is
a
program
that
serves
an
important
regulatory
goal
of
avoiding
the
appearance
of
self-dealing
by
lawyers.
now,
it...
it
raises
money
for
an
important
cause.
and
we
don't
deny
the
importance
of
that
to
the
program.
it
is
a
cause...
ensuring
equal
access
to
justice...
which
enhances
confidence
in
the
system
of
justice,
and
helps
the
petitioners
and
everyone
else
who
uses
that
system.
but
the
relevant
regulatory
interest
noted
by
the
justices
at
the
beginning
of
their
process
is
that
where
lawyers
are
placing
funds
of
their
clients
in
a
bank,
and
the
banks
are
in
a
position
to
benefit
the
lawyers,
you
have
a
risk
of
violating
one
of
the
first
principles
of
legal
ethics
that
lawyers
are
not
to
benefit
directly
or
indirectly
from
their
clients'
funds.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
not
the
formulation.
the...
the
funds
have
to
be
taken
from
the
bank.
they
can't
remain
with
the
bank
because
of
the
serious
ethical
problem
that
was
noted
in
the
briefing
to
the
justices
that
the
banks
are
earning
interest
and
providing
benefits
to
the
very
lawyers,
or
in
the
case
the
real
estate
escrow
agents
who
placed
the
money
there.
if
you
can't
economically
return
it
to
the
client,
if
that
cannot...
if
that
is
not
economically
feasible,
and
you
can't
ethically
leave
it
with
the
bank,
then
it
has
to
go
somewhere.
it
doesn't
have
to
go
to
iolta.
it
has
to
go
to
some
charitable
use
to
avoid
this
ethical
problem.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
there
are
two
problems
with
that
kind
of...
of
client
control.
one
is
the
tax
consequences
to
the
client.
if
the
client
directs
where
the
funds
go,
the
interest
would
be
attributable
to
the
client.
and
secondly,
if
you--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that's
correct.
it...
it...
i
think
that
goes
to
the
right
to
control,
and
the
government
often
regulates
the
right
to
control
one's
property,
particularly
in
a
heavy...
heavily
regulated
industry
such
as
banking.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is...
that
is
precisely
right.
now,
if
you...
if
you
choose
to
have
a
law
firm
do
your
transaction,
but
the
client
says,
i
want
some
other
escrow
agent,
and
not
the
lawyer,
then
you
don't
get
into
iolta.
but
here,
i
think
we
have
a
dispositive
flaw
in
that
there
is
simply
no
just
compensation.
and
the
reason
there
is
no
compensation
is
that
it's
actually
quite
complicated
to
track
and
allocate
all
of
these
funds.
it
may
seem
counterintuitive
that
you
can't
allocate
that
interest
back.
but
in
texas,
for
example,
if
you
look
at,
i
think,
footnote
2
of
the...
of
the
brief
of
49
state
bars,
in
texas,
where
they
made
$5.5
million,
it
was
on
40,000
attorneys'
trust
accounts
that
may
have
had
as
many
as
1
million
discrete
deposits.
and
if
we're
wrong
that...
and
there's
somehow
you
can
allocate
it
back,
you
do
so.
now,
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
is
possible
but
it
is
not
required.
i
don't
believe
that
the
fifth
amendment
has
a
dog
in
the
fight
over...
over
what
charitable
use
the
state
of
washington
chooses
when
they
serve
this
important
purpose
of
making
sure
that
there
is...
that
there
is
not
this
ethical
conflict.
there
are
really
five
different
ways
that
we
could
win
this
case,
just...
because
there
are
so
many
pieces
on
the
gameboard.
you
could
conclude
that
it's
not
a
taking
principally
because
it
has
a
valid
regulatory
purpose.
it's
not...
two,
it's
not
a
taking
because
of
the
absence
of
any
real
investment-backed
expectations.
three,
even
if
it's
a
taking,
we've
established
that
zero
compensation
is
due.
four,
even
if
you
think
some
compensation
might
be
due,
they've
never
gone
to
the
state...
not
a
single
client...
and
tried
to
prove
up
the
amount
of
compensation,
which
is
very
much
in
dispute
if
you
look
at
their
earnings
credit
analysis,
unlike
eastern
enterprises
where
we
knew
the
exact
amount,
it's
very
much
in
dispute
whether
some
or
all
of
those
costs
would
have
been
borne
down.
and
finally,
even
if
you
reject
all
our
other
positions,
you
then
reach
an
argument
that
we
don't
need
to
make
because
we
believe
in
our
other
arguments,
and
that
is,
why
not
treat
this
as
a
valid
revenue
measure?
unlike
the
bad
revenue
measures
of
eastern
enterprises,
where
the
state,
or
the
government
was
imposing
a
retroactive
onerous
burden
on
a
few
identifiable,
known
people,
here
it's
prospective,
reasonably
broadly
based,
and
raises...
and
modest
in
the
exaction.
that
looks
even
as
a
financial
transaction.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i'm
sorry?
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
courts
have
the
power...
and
other
agencies
often...
to
impose
fees.
that's
a
state
law
issue,
but
whether
it's
an
iolta
assessment,
or
a
user
fee,
or
however
you
want
to
characterize
it,
if
you
look
at
it
like
that,
i'm
not
sure
why
it
doesn't
stand
up
quite
well.
whenever
you're
talking
about
money,
you
have
to
decide
why
isn't
this
just
a
valid
way
for
the
government
to
raise
money?
and
part
of
the
takings
clause
shares
an
overlap
with
the
bill
of
attainder
and
the
ex
post
facto.
are
you
singling
out
a
few
individuals
retroactively,
as
justice
kennedy
focused
on
in
eastern
enterprises.
here
you're
not.
anybody
who
chooses
to
engage
in
x
will
pay
y.
when
x
is
a
lot
of
people...
40,000
in
texas...
and
potentially
all
of
us
who
do
transactions,
and
y
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
amount
of
money,
nonexistent
in
our
view,
but
minimal
at
worst
under
their
characterization.
thank
you.
