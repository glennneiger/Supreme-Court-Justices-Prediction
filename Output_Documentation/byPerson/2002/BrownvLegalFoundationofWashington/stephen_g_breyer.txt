justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
doesn't
that
just
prove
that
you
have
the
wrong
clause
of
the
constitution?
that
is,
your
clause
of
the
constitution,
the
one
you're
pushing,
says,
nor
shall
private
property
be
taken
for
public
use
without
just
compensation.
foreseeing
that
you
can
take
the
property
for
public
use,
you
just
have
to
pay
money
for
it.
just
compensation.
now,
if
paying
the
just
compensation
can't
work
out,
or
it's
too
hard
or,
you
know,
the
person
doesn't
have
enough
of
an
interest
to
get
anything,
that
doesn't
mean
the
government
can't
take
it.
it
just...
if
there's
something
wrong
with
it,
it
means
that
that
that
which
is
wrong
with
it
is
that
it
violates
the
due
process
clause,
not
the
just
compensation
clause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
the
rationale...
you'd
say
even...
i
mean,
occasionally
some
case
does
have
something
that's
a
little
hard
to
follow,
but
the...
the
theory
that
that
is
consistent
with
the
just
compensation
clause,
rather
than
the
due
process
clause,
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
it
taken
from
them?
so,
i
mean,
i...
i
can
see
why
you
see
webb
is
very,
very
similar,
but
the
difference
that
i
saw
is
that
webb
says
the
money
should
be
deposited
in
an
ordinary
interest-bearing
account,
and
here
it's
being
deposited
in
a...
in
an
account
that
is
really
the
creation
of
the
government's
program
that
just
couldn't
have
borne
interest
unless
you
collect
all
these
funds
together.
so
without
this
program,
the
person
couldn't
have
earned
interest.
now,
has
the
government
taken
that?
if
they
have
taken
it,
then
why
didn't
the
government
take
it
when
they...
when
they
tax
it.
suppose
the
tax
law
was
illegal
because
it's
very
unreasonable.
why
wouldn't
that
then
be
a
taking?
why
wouldn't
the
government
take
it
when
the
government
has
a
currency
reg
that
imposes
certain
conditions
upon
the
use
of
that
interest?
i'm
back
to
the
same
point.
why
isn't
this
really
a
due
process
problem,
not
a
takings
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i...
i
said
the
difference
in
webb's
is
that
in
webb's
it's
an
ordinary
interest-bearing
account.
here
it's
an
account
that
is
nonexistent
without
the
iolta
program
coming
in
and
saying
we
will
put
funds
together,
and
those
funds
could
not
have
earned
interest
on
their
own.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
making
the
same
argument
in
respect
to
taking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right.
that's
why
he
says
he
wants
the
injunction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
it
didn't.
it
didn't
need
it.
and
his
point
was...
his
point
was
that
since...
if
you
could
theoretically
give
the
compensation,
which
is
impossible
for
the
reason
you
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
impossible.
they're
not
entitled
to
anything
in
cash.
but
look,
if
you
could
do
it
theoretically,
there
would
be
no
more
program,
so
give
us
an
injunction
because
it
comes
to
the
same
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
i
think
they're
saying,
i
agreed
with
you.
you
know,
i
agreed
with
you.
but
i
wrote
a
dissent.
so
they're
saying
that
was
a
dissent.
you
lost.
now,
it
is
the
law
of
the
united
states
that
this
is
property.
indeed,
it
is
their
clients'
property.
now,
you
tell
me
on
that
assumption,
since
i
lost,
why
is
it
not
a
taking
of
that
property
for
which
they
are
entitled
to
just
compensation,
and,
in
this
case,
the
just
compensation
would
have
to
take
the
form
of
an
injunction.
now,
unless...
i'm...
i'm
anxious
to
hear
the
answer
to
that
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good.
so
tell
me
why
it
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
to
the
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
to
say,
i
guess
there's
a
sense
in
which...
suppose
a
robber
had
come
and
said
to
the
depositor,
your
money
or
your
life.
i
mean,
what
would
the
depositor
have
done?
i
guess
he'd
be
dead.
this
money
wouldn't
have
existed.
did
he
take
it
from
him?
did
he
obtain
it
from
him?
there...
there
is
a
problem
there
that
i'd
just
like
you
to
address.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
compensation,
but
i
wonder
what
about...
i
mean,
there
is
a
sense
in
which
the
program
took
the
money,
but
who
did
it
take
from?
did
it
take
it
from
the
property
owner?
is
there
a
sense...
or
do
you
concede
the
point
that
there's
a
taking?
