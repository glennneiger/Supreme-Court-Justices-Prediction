mr.
david
j.
burman
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
with
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
posed
because
i
think
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
flaw
in
plaintiffs'
case.
there
is
an
independent
requirement...
an
independent
element
of
their
cause
of
action
which
is
that
they
show
that
there
was
just
compensation
due
and
denied
by
the
state
of
washington.
that
has
not
happened
here.
mr.
david
j.
burman
no.
the
position
is
that
there
is
no
unconstitutional
taking
if
we
would
pay
compensation.
certainly
the...
the
plain
language
of
the
clause
says
the
property
may
be
taken.
mr.
david
j.
burman
in
certain
circumstances,
the
just
compensation
clause
acts
a
shield.
mr.
david
j.
burman
the
process
might
well--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--that
is
not--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--that
is
the
position
of
this
court's
cases,
not
the
position
of
the
state
of
washington,
which
does
not
go
that
far.
our
position
is
that--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--one
was
not
stated
here.
mr.
david
j.
burman
correct.
other
plaintiffs
might
well
have
a
due
process
claim.
these
plaintiffs
may
well
still
have
a
first
amendment
claim
since
their
real
complaint
with
this
is
their
subjective
ideological
one,
subjectivity
which
this
court
has
said
is
not
the
business
of
the
just
compensation
clause.
mr.
david
j.
burman
under
this
court's
cases,
it
is
not
their
money.
the
court
has
been
very
careful
to
say
that
what
we
look
at,
because
the
just
compensation
clause
is
a
type
of
indemnity
provision
that
is
worried
about
responding
with...
to
loss
of
pecuniary
or
monetary
value...
the
court
in
the
parcel
aggregation
cases,
such
as
boston
chamber
and
sage,
made
it
very
clear
that
if
it
is
not
economically
practicable,
if
the
costs
of
aggregation
would
exceed
the
benefit,
there
is
no
just
compensation.
mr.
david
j.
burman
answering
the
question
of
whether
it's
property,
as
the
court
made
clear
in
phillips,
does
not
answer
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
taking,
or
the
question
of
whether
there
is
just
compensation.
mr.
david
j.
burman
the
government
does,
as
it
had
the
additional
value
in
the
cases
such
as
the
boston
chamber
case,
and
in--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--that
is
gross.
and,
in
fact,
in
webb's,
the
very
case
they
rely
upon,
the
court
said
the
government
can
deduct
the
cost
of
protecting
that
money
before
you
calculate
what
is
due.
that
is
exactly
what
happened--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--webb's
did
not
have
an
injunction.
mr.
david
j.
burman
it's--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--where
the
textual
language
is
just
compensation,
and
where
the
value
is
economic
or
pecuniary
or
monetary
loss,
as
this
court's
cases
often
say,
it's
not
just
that
there
is
no
way
to
remedy
this
problem.
there
is
no
remedy
called
for
by
the
constitution.
the
remedy
is
just
compensation.
i
take
this--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--that
may
be
a
very
different
case.
these
plaintiffs
have
never
tried
that.
that
is
not
their
complaint.
they
make
no
allegation--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--actually,
we
don't
know
that.
mr.
david
j.
burman
no.
we
don't
know
that
that's
the
case
because
they've
never
presented
it
to
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
david
j.
burman
our
burden
is
not
to
come
up
with
hypotheticals
for
other
cases
that
they
might
bring.
these
two
plaintiffs
brought
their
case.
mr.
david
j.
burman
yes.
mr.
david
j.
burman
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
burman
and
the
difference
is
what
is
unique
about
the
government's
program
and
what
boston
chamber
says
would
be
relevant,
if
individuals
could
do
it,
was
aggregation
that
reduces
the
transaction
costs.
in
a
hypothetical
where--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--justice
scalia--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--there
is
an
element
of
compulsion
there
that
is
not
present
here,
and
there
is
no...
you...
you
posit
no
regulatory
purpose.
this
arose
out
of
a
clear
regulatory
purpose
to--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--and...
and
they
should
present
that
argument.
it
may
well
be
that
they
could
come
up
with
a
scheme
that
would
reduce
the
transaction
costs
and
create
a
net
value,
and
the
plain
language
of
the
rule
says
if
that
happens,
the
lawyer
has
to
honor
it.
mr.
david
j.
burman
it
is
the
lawyer's
obligation.
mr.
david
j.
burman
you
lost
only
on
the
question
of
whether
the
majority
should
have
looked
at
those
additional
elements.
the
majority
was
very
clear
to
say
we
express
no
opinion.
we
state
no
view
on
these
other
questions.
that
would
be
nonsensical
if
in
fact
it
follows
automatically
from
what
the
majority
said,
but
clearly
that's
not
the
case.
mr.
david
j.
burman
with
respect
to
the
injunction
question,
if
i
could
jump
ahead
to...
to
that
part
of
your
hypothetical,
eastern
enterprises,
we
believe,
is
a
different
situation
where,
as
in
the
youpee
case,
the
court
basically
said
congress
could
not
intended
this
circularity,
and
so
we
are
not
going
to
read
the
statute
that
way.
this
is
different
when
you
have
the
state,
and
it's
different
where,
even
the
dissenters
in
the
ninth
circuit
below
admitted
that
the
amount
due,
if
any,
is
going
to
be
smaller
than
the
gross
interest.
in
cases
such
as
webb's,
in
cases
such
as
sperry,
even
in
phillips,
the
court
seemed
to
acknowledge
that
the
deduction
made
sense.
mr.
david
j.
burman
there
is
property.
we
believe
there
is
no
taking,
and
mr.
dellinger
will
address
that
perhaps
more
directly
than
i
will.
but
it
is--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--the
property
was
transferred,
just
as
in
connolly,
just
as
in
eastern
enterprises.
mr.
david
j.
burman
correct.
it
has
not
been
taken
by
applying
the
multi-factor
test
that
the
court
says
applies
when
you
have
a
transfer
of
dollars,
which
is
what
happened
in
those
cases.
and
when
you
apply
that
test,
these
plaintiffs
admit
no
investment
expectation,
no
net
economic
loss.
mr.
david
j.
burman
these
owners
transferred
the
property
to
an
intermediary
on
its
way
to
a
third
party.
it
would
be
a
really
odd
rule
if
somehow
the
right
to
exclude
was
independent
of
the
economic
value
of
money.
just
as
interest
may
follow
principal,
it
would
make
sense
that
the
right
to
exclude
has
to
follow
the
economic
value
when
you
send
it
to
an--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--the...
the--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--the
problem
if...
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
if
you
give
the
client
the
right
to
opt
out,
the
irs
says
that
becomes
taxable.
we're
not
saying
that
you
net
out
the
taxes--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--correct,
and
that--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--it...
i
believe
it
might
well
be
able
to
function,
and
i
think
it's
important
that
there's
no
compulsion--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--it
is...
it
may
be
taxable
to
the
person
who
opts
out.
mr.
david
j.
burman
it
may
not
be
to
the
others.
i
don't
know
the--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--oh,
if
they
had
the
right.
you...
and...
you're
correct.
mr.
david
j.
burman
i
stand
corrected.
mr.
david
j.
burman
and
it's
not
the
tax
that
needs
to
be
netted
out.
it's
the
cost
of
individually
recording,
tracking,
paying,
and
reporting
to
the
irs
that
eats
up
these
nominal
amounts.
that
is
the
problem
here.
if
i
could
make
one
correction
to
something
mr.
fried
said.
there
is
no
compulsion
here.
you
don't
have
to
go
to
an
escrow
agency
that
has
an
lpo
or
a
lawyer.
you
can
go
to
one
that
does
not
have
one.
in
washington
and
many
states,
that's
the
case.
there
is
no
compulsion
here--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--absolutely.
banks
effectively
encumber
interest
with
their
charges.
that's
what
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
alleges.
they
say
prior
to
iolta,
banks
paid
no
interest.
they
bundled
and
effectively
encumbered
it
there.
when
required
to
separate
it
out,
i
can
guarantee
you,
you
won't
be
allowed
to
go
to
a
bank
and
say,
i'd
like
to
withdraw
my
$100
and
my
5
cents
of
interest
and
maybe
i'll
pay
a
year
$5
in
service
charges
later
if
i
feel
like
it.
that
does
not
happen.
this
is
money
that
is
encumbered,
and
you
should
look
at
the
net
amount.
if
there
is
no
value
lost,
there
is
no
taking
under
this
court's
cases.
kimball
laundry
could
not
be
more
clear.
in
kimball
laundry,
the
court
said
for
any--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--if
you
compelled
them
to
do
it,
that
might
be
a
different
case.
it
is
mr.
fried's
proposal,
which
i
believe
if
he
had
a
narrower
argument
he
would
have
made
it,
but
he
gives
you
the
radical
and
startling
argument
that
you
only
look
at
the
gross
amount
and
even...
and
that
even
if
there
is
no
net
value
due,
which
in
case
after
case...
such
as
kimball
laundry
and
marion
&
rye...
the
court
has
said,
if
no
economic
value
lost,
no
fair
market
value,
no
violation.
here
you
have
a
perfectly
functioning
market.
the
banks.
they
decide
what
is
the
fair
market
value
of
the
time
value
of
money
and
they
encumber
it
within
the
costs--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--that's
part
of
the
baseline
that
they
do
not
challenge.
mr.
david
j.
burman
it's--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--correct.
they
do
not
attack
it.
it's
the
federal
government
that
creates
a
tax
system
that
requires
a
lot
of
record-keeping.
they
do
not
challenge
that
baseline
cost,
and
our
argument
is
that
for
that
reason,
there
is
no
value
lost,
no
violation--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--as
in
yee
and
pruneyard
and
florida
power,
the
plaintiffs
voluntarily
went
into
a
transaction.
they
gave
up
their
right
to
exclude.
they
gave
up
this
interest
for
an
intermediary
for
it
to
move
on.
mr.
david
j.
burman
certainly.
they
could
have
filled
out
the
forms
themself,
and
gone
to
an
escrow
agent
that
did
not
employ
an
lpo
or
a
lawyer.
thank
you.
