justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
the
difference--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
the
difference,
mr.
fried,
that
in
the...
in
the
rent
example,
what
the...
what
the
members
of
the
court
were
assuming
was
that
if
somebody
wants
to
be
a
bad
businessperson,
he's
perfectly
free
to
do
it,
and
until
he
goes
bankrupt,
or
loses
the
property,
he
can
collect
the
rent.
the
situation
here
is
different
because
the
situation
here
is
such
that
there's
nothing
to
collect.
the...
the
way
the
background
principles
of
the
banking
statutes
are
set
up,
or...
which
are
effected
by
the
banking
statutes
means
that
the...
the
rent,
the
penny,
the
interest,
never
gets
to
the
person
who
owns
the
principal.
and
isn't
that
why...
isn't
that
exactly
why
phillips
does
not
determine
the
result
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
may
not
be
the...
the
best
expert
on
what
the...
what
the
majority
meant
by
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
thought
what
the
majority
meant
by
that
was
that
when
you
aggregate,
as...
as
is
the
case
in
these
iolta
accounts,
of
course
there
is
a
fractional
sense
that
is
attributable
to
every
item
that...
a
fractional
sense
of
the
interest
that's
attributable
to
every
item
that
goes
into
the
aggregation,
but
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
any
of
that
attributable
amount
could
ever
be
netted
out
and
ever
be
received
under
the
banking
statutes
by
those
individuals
to
whom
it
is
attributable.
if,
in
fact,
it
were
the
other
way,
then
the
iolta
scheme
would
force
a
separate
now
account
to
have
been
set
up.
justice
david
h.
souter
--why...
why
don't
you,
though,
have
to
make
exactly
the
same
argument
if
iolta
goes
down
the
drain...
compulsory
iolta
goes
down
the
drain
on
your
theory?
why
don't
you
have
to
make
the
same
argument
about
the...
the
background
government
regulation
which,
in
effect,
gives
the
interest
to
the
bank?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
it
does.
it
says,
look,
bank,
you
can
take
in
money,
but
you
can't
pay
out
any
interest
on
it.
you
can't
pay
out
interest
on
a
straight
checking
account
and
you
can't
pay
out
now
interest
to
a
corporation.
therefore,
in
effect,
you
get
to
keep
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the...
the
effect
of
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
just
as
much
to
deprive
your
client
of
the
$5,
if
there
is
any
deprivation
at
all,
as...
as
it
is
to
deprive
it
when
it
says
iolta
gets
it
instead
of
the
bank.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
your
client,
i
suppose,
is
not
compelled
to
engage
in
this
consensual
transaction
with
the
broker.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
client--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
the
client
is
compelled
to
deposit
the
money
if
it
wishes
to
get
banking
services.
but
in
no
instance...
either
the
iolta
case,
or
the
background
regs
case...
does
the
government
say
to
the
person
with
$10
in
his
pocket,
you've
got
to
put
it
in
the
bank,
or
you've
got
to
spend
that
money
on
real
estate.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
compulsion
is
the
same
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
dellinger,
isn't
the...
isn't
it...
it's
their
money
that
earned
it.
isn't
interest
by
definition
that
which
is
netted
out
that
the
bank
pays
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
that
is
the
definition
of
interest,
then
there
was
no
$5.
there
was
no
interest
earned
on
this
amount.
isn't
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
dellinger,
in...
in
that...
i
want
to
get
clear
on
that
example.
if
there
were
such
a
designation,
leaving
the
tax
consequence
aside,
isn't...
isn't
it
true
on
the
facts
under
the
washington
scheme
that
the
cost
of
identifying
the
amount
that
would
go
to
the
charity
would
be
greater
than
that
amount
so
that,
in
effect,
ultimately
the...
the
charity
would
net
nothing,
there
would
be
no
tax,
a
tax
return
would
have
to
be
filed
saying
zero.
is...
is
that
right?
