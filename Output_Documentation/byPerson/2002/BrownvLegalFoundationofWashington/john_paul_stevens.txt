justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
number
01-1325,
washington
legal
foundation
against
the
legal
foundation
of
washington.
mr.
fried,
you
may
proceed
when...
whenever
you're
ready.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
start,
mr.
fried,
may
i
ask
you
one
broad
question?
you
don't
agree,
i
take
it,
with
the
conclusion
of
the
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals,
which
i
don't
think
agreed
with
your
fourth
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
point
i
was
really
want...
you...
you
do
not
understand
the
dissenters
in
the
ninth
circuit
to
have
gone
that
far,
though,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
have
held
that
you're
entitled
to
injunctive
relief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
paragraph--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
weren't
those
gross
figures
rather
than
net
figures?
those--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
can
we
assume,
along
with
justice
o'connor's
question,
that
there's
no
net
loss
to
the
property
owner?
we
assume
the...
the
interest
is
the...
goes
with
the
principal,
and
therefore
it's
property,
and
property
has
been
taken.
but
has
there
been
any
net
loss
to
the
person
from
whom
the
property
has
been
taken?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it
had
been--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
agree
if
it
was
a
taking
and
you
were
to
get
just
compensation,
you
would
get
the
net
loss
rather
than
the
gross
loss?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
agree
with
that...
that
premise?
couldn't
a...
a
group
of
attorneys
or
real
estate
brokers
form
their
own
consortium
and
say
in
order
to
avoid
wasting
this
interest,
we're
going
to
put
the
interest
in
a
special
fund
and
we'll
give
clients
a
check-off
system
where
we'll
expend
it
the
way
they
want?
private...
private
enterprise
could
do
exactly
what
iolta
is
doing,
could
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if...
if
the
government
let
it,
and
just
because
the
government
doesn't
want
to
let
it,
doesn't
mean
the
government
has
a
right
to
do
it
on
its
own.
isn't
that
your
point,
or
isn't
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--except
correct
one...
or
explain
one
thing
to
me.
i
thought
that
if
it
netted
out
so
that
there
was
no
net
amount
available
to
the
depositor,
that...
i
mean,
the
other
way
around.
if
it
netted
out
that
there
was...
something
was
due,
even
5
or
10
cents,
then
that
would
be
improper,
and
you'd
have
to
give
them
the
money
back.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
burman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
dellinger.
mr.
fried,
you
have
about
5
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
i
shouldn't
be
taking
your
rebuttal
time,
mr.
fried,
but
are
you
saying
that
if
they
did
this
by
a
statute,
it
would
be
perfectly
okay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
part
of
the
revenue
code.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
program
was
exactly
the
same,
it
was
adopted
by
a
legislature,
and
had
the
title
tax
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
i
know
the
answer
to
my
question.
if
they
did
exactly
what
i
said,
would
it
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fried,
you
may
have
another
minute
if
you
didn't
get
your
rebuttal
through.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
course
of
their
legal
practice,
attorneys
are
frequently
required
to
hold
clients
funds
various
lengths
of
time.
they
have
a
professional
obligation
to
avoid
commingling
their
client's
money
with
their
own.
but
it
is
not
unethical
to
pull
several
client's
fund
in
a
single
trust
account.
before
1980,
client
funds
were
typically
held
in
non-interest
bearing
federal
insured
checking
accounts,
but
because
the
federal
banking
regulations
in
effect
since
the
great
depression
prohibited
banks
from
paying
interests
on
checking
accounts
the
value
of
the
use
of
the
client's
money
in
such
accounts
innured
to
the
banking
institution.
in
1980
congress
authorized
federally
insured
banks
to
pay
interest
on
a
limited
category
of
demand
deposit
referred
to
as
now
accounts.
this
category
includes
deposits
made
by
individuals
and
charitable
organizations
but
does
include
those
made
by
for
profit
corporations
or
partnerships,
unless
the
deposits
are
made
pursuant
to
a
program
under
which
charitable
organizations
have
the
inclusive
right
to
the
interest.
in
response
to
the
change
in
federal
law,
every
state
in
the
nation
has
adapted
a
so-called
iolta
program.
iolta
is
an
acronym
for
interest
on
lawyers
trust
accounts.
authorizing
the
use
of
now
accounts
for
the
deposit
of
client
funds
and
providing
that
all
the
interest
on
such
accounts
be
used
for
charitable
purposes.
this
case
presents
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
iolta
program
adopted
by
the
state
of
washington
supreme
court.
an
important
feature
of
that
program
is
that
it
categorically
prohibits
deposits
of
client
funds
into
iolta
accounts
if
those
funds
could
produce
net
interest
for
the
client.
the
two
petitioners
in
this
case
are
individuals
who
regularly
purchase
and
sell
real
estate.
one
of
them
made
an
excrow
deposit
of
about
$15,000
that
was
placed
in
an
iolta
account
for
two
weeks
and
the
other
made
a
$90,000.00
excrow
payment
that
was
held
in
an
iolta
account
for
two
days.
the
parties
assumed
that
the
first
deposit
generated
some
interest
and
that
the
second
earned
$4.96,
but
neither
petitioner
claimed
that
he
could
have
earned
any
net
interest
in
a
non-iolta
account,
or
that
the
interest
earned
on
his
deposit
in
the
iolta
account
actually
exceeded
the
bank
charges
and
other
transaction
cost
that
would
have
been
incurred
in
an
attempt
to
remit
any
net
interest
to
him.
after
discovery,
the
district
court
granted
the
defendant's
motions
for
summary
judgment.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
concluded
that
in
no
event
can
the
client
depositors
make
any
net
returns
on
the
interest
acrued
in
this
accounts,
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
concluded
that
constitutional
issue
focuses
on
what
the
owner
has
lost
not
what
the
government
has
gained.
since
petitioners
had
lost
nothing
there
had
been
no
taking
without
just
compensation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
sitting
en
banc
affirm
and
we
granted
certiorari.
like
all
of
the
other
judges
who
have
participated
in
this
case,
we
agree
with
the
proposition
that
just
compensation
required
by
the
taking
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
measured
by
the
property
owners
loss
rather
by
the
government's
gain.
petitioners'
loss
under
washingtonâ€™s
iolta
rules
was
zero.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
the
just
compensation
that
is
due
for
a
net
loss
of
zero
is
zero.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
scalia
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
that
has
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
kennedy
and
justice
thomas;
justice
kennedy
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
