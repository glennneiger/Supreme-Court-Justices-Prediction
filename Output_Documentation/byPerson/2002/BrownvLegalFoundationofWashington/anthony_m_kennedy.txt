justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let...
let
me
see
if
i
can
help
you
get
to
the
other
major
parts
of
your
case
by
asking
this
question.
in
loretto,
could
the
property
owners
have
obtained
an
injunction
against
piercing
the
building
for
the
little
antenna
or
the
wire
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
compensation?
i
doubt
it.
i
would
think
the
government,
after
loretto,
would
continue
to
be
able
to
poke
the
holes
in...
in
the
wall...
or
maybe
i'm
wrong...
even
though
compensation
was
negligible.
could
there
have
been
an
injunction
there,
and
if
the
answer
is,
well,
no,
why
can
there
be
an
injunction
here?
and
maybe
that
gets
you
to
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
nature
of
the
taking
that
occurred
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
my
hypothetical
on
loretto?
i...
i
take
it
loretto
establishes
that
there
was
an
invasion,
a
taking--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
let's...
let's
assume
that
the
compensation
was
just
so
minimal
it
just
really
couldn't
be
calculated.
it
was
10
cents
or
something.
could
you
have
had
an
injunction
against
installation
of
the
antennas
in
loretto
on
the
ground
that
the
compensation
can't
be
figured?
i
think
not.
and
if
that's...
if
my
conclusion
is
right
about
that,
how
is
your
case
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
position
of
the
state
of
washington
is
that
it
can
take
any
property
so
long
as
it
doesn't
have...
so
long
as
compensation
can't
be
calculated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
doesn't...
doesn't
the
state
have
some
duty
to
recognize
that
the
constitution
protects
property
and
it
shouldn't
take
property
that
doesn't
belong
to
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
if
you
can
get
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
if
you
can
get
away
with
taking
property
just
because
it
can't
be
valued,
then
you
can
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
position
of
the
state
of
washington.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose...
suppose
there
were
a
state
in
which
a
group
of
lawyers
or
real...
people
with
real
estate
accounts
got
together
and
say,
we
really
should
pool
this
interest
and
we'll
give
our
clients
a
choice
of
four
different
things
that
they
can
allocate
the
money
to.
and
we're
just
going
to
do
that
as
a
service,
and
we
think
it's
good
business.
actually
we
might...
the
company
that
does
this
might
make
a
few
dollars
themselves.
if
that
were
in
place,
could
the
state
of
washington
do
what
it
does
now,
say,
you
know,
this
looks
like
a
good
idea?
we
think
we'll
take
it
for
what
we
like.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
can...
do
they
even
have
the
possibility
of
trying
that
given
the
regulation
that
you
now
have?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you've
taken
away,
in
effect,
a
business
opportunity,
have
you
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
certainly
profitable
for
you
to
do
it.
why
do
you
think
you
can
do
what
private
business
can't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
your
burden
is
to
answer
hypotheticals--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
establish
whether
or
not
a
property
interest
is
being
taken
in
violation
of
the
constitution
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
say
that
simply
because
it
can't
be
computed,
a,
because
of
the
small
amounts,
and
b,
because
of
the
government's
unique
program,
that
it
is
not
property
anymore.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
justice
breyer's
question
i
think
was,
is
there
or
is
there
not
a
taking
of
property
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
been
regulated
out
of
existence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
it's
been
transferred
but
not
taken.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it...
it
seems
to
me
an
odd
rule
that
it's
not
a
right
of
the
owner
to
decide
to
whom
the
owner
can
transfer
the
property.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
a
perfectly
functioning
market
when
you
have
federal
and
state
regulations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
that's
your
definition
of
a
functioning
market,
the...
it's
the
federal
government
that
says
it
has
to
be
deducted...
it
has
to
be
spent
for
charity
purposes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
that
regulation
isn't
attacked.
i'm
not
sure
why.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
that's
the
issue
before
us.
i'm
just
not
sure
of
a
precedent
which
says
that
if
just
compensation
can't
be
calculated,
the
government
is
free
to
take
someone's
property
for
itself.
and...
and
i'm
just
baffled
by
what
that
principle
might
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the...
so
this
property
can
be
misused
and
the
state
can
take
the
property.
that's...
that's
your
formulation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
can't...
why
can't
the
private
system
design
mechanisms
so
that
clients
and
attorneys
can
designate
the
cause
to
which
they
want
it
to
go?
then,
they're
having
control
over
their
property.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
if
the
client
designated
a
charity,
that
would
be
a
charitable
deduction.
maybe
or
maybe
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
could
have
a
separate
funds.
you
could...
you
could
have
four
different
funds
that
attorneys
could
choose.
you
could
choose
save
the
whales,
or
help...
help
litigation
fee--
