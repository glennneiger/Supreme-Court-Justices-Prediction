justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
comparison
would
be
between
the
university,
education,
which
was
the...
which
was
the
defendant,
and
the
tax
authorities.
both
of
those,
education
and
tax,
seem
core.
or
if
you're
going
to
compare
the
tort
itself,
it
would
be
a
comparison
between
negligent
driving,
on
the
one
hand,
and
going
into
another
state
and
committing...
you
know,
peering
through
windows,
going
through
garbage,
totally
wrongly
getting
all
the
neighbors
to
reveal
private
information,
et
cetera.
so
comparing
the
particular
acts,
what's
the
difference,
or
comparing
sovereign
functions,
what's
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
education
versus
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
the
sovereign
function.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
saying
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
seems
like
that's
apples
and
oranges
to
me.
that
is,
in
the
one
case,
we're
looking
at
the
acts
they're
complaining
of,
and
here
the
plaintiff
is
complaining
of
acts
that
took
place
in
nevada
that
were
miles
outside
what
would
be
reasonable.
i'm
not
saying
he's
right,
but
that's
his
complain.
in
nevada
v.
hall,
they
were
complaining
about
negligent
driving.
so
what's
the
difference
there?
or,
alternatively,
in
nevada
v.
hall,
it
was
a
driver
who
worked
for
a
university,
and
here
it
is
an
investigator
who
works
for
the
tax
board.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
matter.
i
mean,
we're
trying
to
get
the...
we're
trying
to
get
the
analysis
of
it,
and
i'm
having
exactly
the
same
problem.
imagine
that,
you
know,
california
did
say
there
is
absolute
immunity,
even
if
you
beat
somebody
up,
absolute
tort
immunity.
okay?
even
for
beating
people
up.
now,
suppose
they
did
have
that;
you
could
prosecute
it
as
a
crime.
now
you're
in
nevada,
and
they
say,
the
plaintiff,
he
beat
me
up,
he
came
across
the
state
line,
down
from
lake
tahoe.
he
was
in
a
bad
mood,
lost
too
much
money
at
the
casino,
and
he
beat
me
up.
all
right?
now,
can
nevada
bring
that
lawsuit
or
not?
that's,
i
think,
what
justice
stevens'
question
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
therefore,
you
could
not
bring
the
lawsuit
in
nevada
about
somebody
beating
somebody
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that
were
the
law
in
california.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how,
then,
do
we
reconcile
that
position,
where
we're
back
to
our
starting
place,
with
the
fact
that
he
could
bring
an
action
if
on
his
way
down
from
lake
tahoe
in
the
state
car,
he
happened
to
drive
a
little
negligently
and
ran
somebody
over?
i
mean,
that's
nevada
v.
hall,
just
reverse
the
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
so
this
is
why
we're
having
a
problem.
it's
clear
that
if
our
tax
collector,
on
his
way
down
from
lake
tahoe,
runs
over
a
nevada
resident,
the
nevada
resident
can
sue
and
apply
nevada
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say,
if,
in
fact,
that
same
tax
collector
beats
up
somebody,
and
the
california
law
is
that
you
cannot
sue,
nevada
cannot
apply
its
own
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
about
a
congressional
statute?
that
is,
suppose
the
opinion
read...
what
would
your
objection...
i
know
you'll
object
to
this
possible
opinion,
and
i
want
to
hear
what
your
objection
is...
the
opinion
says
they're
complaining
here,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
with
a
serious
tort,
invasion
of
privacy,
you
know,
a
whole
lot
of
really
bad
behavior,
et
cetera...
they're
complaining
about
that
taking
place
by
a
california
official
in
nevada,
and
we
can't
really
distinguish
that
from
the
automobile
accident
taking
place
in
nevada.
they're
both
torts.
they're
both
very
bad...
you
know,
this
is
worse
conduct.
now,
it's
true
that
our
investigation
of
this
may
interfere
with
california's
tax
authority's
ability
to
sort
of
run
investigations
in
general.
but
if
that
turns
out
to
be
a
problem,
a
big
problem,
congress
can
legislate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
how
does
alden
fit
into
this?
in
alden,
i
take
it
the
court
now...
we've
held
that
a
citizen
of
maine
suing
in
the
state
of
maine's
courts
alleging
that
maine
had
violated
a
federal
law
can't
do
it.
sovereign
immunity.
right?
that's
alden.
all
right.
suppose
the
citizen
of
maine
walks
into
a
new
hampshire
court
and
brings
the
same
lawsuit
against
maine,
assuming
new
hampshire
has
appropriate
jurisdiction
under
its
own
laws.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
get
a
different
result?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
see,
what
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--nonetheless,
although--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
i'm
trying
to
do
is...
is
sort
out
what,
in
my
mind,
are
a
set
of
impossible
anomalies,
and
that's
why
i
ask
you
that
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
yeah,
of
course.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--your
answer,
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--your
answer
to
my
question
is
alden
cannot
be
avoided
simply
by
the
maine
citizen
walking
into
a
new
hampshire
court
and
bringing
the
same
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
would
guess
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
assuming
that's
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--assuming
that's
right,
now,
look
at
the
tremendous
anomaly,
which
you
were
just
about
to
address,
and
i
want
to
be
sure
you
do.
our
citizen
of
maine
walks
into
the
new
hampshire
court
and
sues
the
state
of
maine
under
federal
law.
and
the
answer
is,
he
can't
do
it
because
of
sovereign
immunity.
our
citizen
of
maine
does
the
same
thing,
but
this
time
his
cause
of
action
is
state
law.
and
now
you
say
he
can
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
only
difference
between
the
two
cases
is
that
his
cause
of
action
is
federal
law
in
the
first
case,
and
he
can't
sue
the
state;
but
state
law
in
the
second
case,
and
he
can,
which,
of
course,
means
that
the
law
of
new
hampshire
binds
maine
in
a
way
that
federal
law
cannot.
now,
that,
to
me,
i
just
can't...
that,
to
me,
seems
so
anomalous
that...
that
i'd
like
an
explanation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
you
can
give
it.
and
you
see
how
i'm
thinking
of
it
as
connected
here,
because
the
facts
here
are
just
part
of
that
general
anomaly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh-huh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
but
what...
what...
what
is
the...
i
don't
want
to...
i
don't
want
you
to
get
distracted,
because
i
thought
justice
ginsberg
and
maybe
justice
kennedy
and
i
were
driving
at
the
same
problem,
which
is
that
imagine
nevada
v.
hall
is
good
law.
all
right,
now,
the
question
comes
up,
how
do
you
prevent
nevada
from
going
wild?
all
right.
and
so
now
we
have
several
answers:
(a),
congress
can
pass
a
statute--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--(b)
interstate
compacts...
that
was
what
you
were
suggesting.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right,
some--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--kind
of
a
voluntary
action
by
the
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
(c)
privileges
and
immunities,
which
has
the
problem
that
it
refers
to
citizens
and
not
states,
(d)
equal
protection
doesn't
work,
i
don't
think,
because
it
says,
again,
citizens.
a
due
process
clause,
is
a
state
a
person
under
the
due
process
clause?
(e),
what's
(e)?
i
mean,
you
see?
if
nevada...
(e)
is,
of
course,
footnote
24,
but
then
that
gets
us
into
the
national
league
of
cities
problem.
and
so
national
league
of
cities--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that...
that...
that
approach...
equal...
no,
privileges
and
immunities,
due
process
of
law,
voluntary
action
states,
congress
enacts
a
law,
anything
else?
have
we
got...
is
that
the
exhaustive
list
that
we
must
choose
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
only...
all
right,
that's...
if...
if
nothing
in
that
list
works,
then
the
only
alternative
is
overrule
nevada
v.
hall.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or,
excuse
me--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--comity...
comity
is
not
the
answer
to
the
problem,
because...
well,
it
is,
in
a
sense.
it
is,
in
a
sense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
voluntary
restraint.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
leave...
say,
this
case,
i
can
easily
see
on
your
theory
writing
the
part
of
the
opinion
that
says
the
acts
in
nevada,
the
acts
in
nevada
that
were
arguably
torts
are
certainly
up
to
nevada
to
pursue.
but
the
discovery
commissioner
here,
they
say,
went
way
too
far
in
ordering
discovery
and
ordered
discovery
that
would
have
been
relevant
only
to
negligent
action
and
only
negligent
action,
really,
that
took
place
in
california,
though
a
nevada
resident
was
at
issue.
and
they
can't
do
that,
says
the
opinion,
because...
because...
and
now
this
is
where
it
seems
to
me
there...
something...
what
do
i
fill
that
blank
with.
they
can't
do
that.
they
can't
go
over
and,
in
nevada,
complain
about
negligent
action
as
this
discovery
commissioner
may
have
done,
negligent
action
in
california
aimed
at
a
nevada
resident
where
it's
a
tax
action.
they
can't
do
that
because...
and
now
what?
you
see...
do
you
see
what's
bothering
me?
i...
at
this
point,
it
seems
to
me
there
has
to
be
something
in
the
constitution
that
limits
that,
and
this
case
may
raise
that
problem
because
of
the
actions
of
the
discovery
commissioner.
and,
therefore,
i
think
i
need
something
to
fill
that
blank
with.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
it's
an
odd...
an
awkward
vehicle,
full
faith--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
what
is
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
answer
is
if
they
want
to
do
that,
they
can
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh-huh.
