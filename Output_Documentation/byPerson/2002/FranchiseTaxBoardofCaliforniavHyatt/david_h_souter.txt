justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be,
but
the
that
isn't
the
issue
that
we've
got
in
front
of
us
here.
i
mean,
the
question
in
front
of
us
is
not
how
far
can
the
nevada
courts
go
in
reviewing
california's
tax
practice.
the
issue
before
us
is,
among
others,
in
a
claim
of
tort
against
your...
your
operative
in
nevada,
for
the
manner
in
which
the
tax
is
collected
is
their
absolute
immunity.
and,
you
know,
maybe
the
nevada
courts
are
going
too
far
in
discovery,
but
that's
not
the
issue
in
front
of
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
justice
stevens'
question,
because
i'm
not
sure
of
your
answer
to
it.
what
if
the
state
of
california
passed
a
statute
tomorrow
morning
saying
the
use
of
thumbscrews
in
tax
collection
is
authorized?
is...
would
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
be
that...
or
wouldn't
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
be
that
if
you
went
into
nevada
and
you
used
thumbscrews,
you
would
be
entitled,
on
your
theory,
to
absolute
immunity?
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
is
the
reason
that
the
answer
is
different
in
the
two
cases,
the
reason
that
there
is
something
special
about
tax
collection
or
is
the
reason
that
there
is
a
closer
connection
in
the
hypo
of
the
beating
up
for
tax
collection
than
the
driving
the
automobile
for
tax
collection?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
it?
is
it
the
nature
of
the
tax
collection
or
the
nature
of
the
activity
which
leads
to
the
tort
liability?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
what
is...
was
your
answer
to
the
question?
suppose
that
this
tax
collector
were
driving
negligently
in
nevada--
justice
david
h.
souter
--suppose
the
tax
collector
were
driving
negligently
in
las
vegas.
it's
very
important
for
the
tax
collector
to
go
examine
the
record,
and
he's
driving
negligently.
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
suppose
that
we...
we
conclude
that
footnote
24
does
not
provide
sufficient
guidance
for
us
to
have
a
stable
jurisprudence
and
that
you
will
lose
unless
nevada
versus
hall
is
overruled.
would
you
then
ask
us
to
overrule
nevada
versus
hall?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know
you
don't
want
to
entertain
that
possibility,
but
suppose
that's
what
we
conclude.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
i
thought--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
would
go
to
individual
liability,
but
it
would...
it
would
not
affect
this
question,
but
i
may
be
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
comity
on
the
list?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean...
i
mean
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the...
what
if
the
case
came,
and
they
didn't
do
it?
justice
breyer's
question,
how
do
i
fill
in
the
blank?
i...
if,
let's
say,
through
this
intrusive
discovery
process,
systematically
applied,
they
really
were
interfering
with
california's
taxation,
couldn't
california
bring
an
original
action
to
enjoin
this
interference?
