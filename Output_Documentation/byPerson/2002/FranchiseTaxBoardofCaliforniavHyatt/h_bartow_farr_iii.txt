mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
federal
system,
it's
recognized
that
the
states
will
sometimes
have
overlapping
jurisdiction.
when
that
happens,
the
constitution
allows
each
state
to
apply
its
own
laws
against
the
background
principle
of
comity
where
they
believe
it
would
be
appropriate
to
defer
to
the
laws
of
another
state.
and
i
submit
that
the
nevada
courts
here
have
applied
these
principles
very
carefully.
nevada,
of
course,
correctly
held
that
they
were
not
required
to
apply
california's
legislative-created
law
of
immunity.
at
the
same
time,
however,
they
have
applied
principles
of
comity
to
strike
out
the
declaratory
judgment
count
that
would
have
gone
to
the
very
issue
that
is
being
contested
in
the
florida...
excuse
me...
in
the
california
tax
proceeding,
which
is
the
date
that
mr.
hyatt
moved
to
nevada.
and
they
have
also
given
california
complete
immunity
for
any
negligence
that
it
has
committed.
so
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me,
the
system
is
working--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--that's
an
interesting
question,
justice
stevens,
because
nevada
officials
themselves
have
immunity.
there
would
be
a
question,
i
suppose,
of
whether
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
requires
that.
my
general
feeling
is
probably
not,
but
that
is
really
not
a
question
so
much
of
whether...
a
choice
of
law
between
california
law
and
nevada
law,
but
simply
a
question
of
what
nevada
law
would
apply.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
itself
speaks
to
that
issue,
but
i
do
think
principles
of
comity
will
traditionally
reach
that
result.
and,
in
fact--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--they
are--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--that's
correct,
yes.
and
i
don't
think
there
is
a
federally
enforceable
law
of
state
comity,
but
i
think
that
is
the
system
that
has
existed
essentially
between
sovereigns
for
much
longer
than
the
united
states
is--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--well,
the
first
question,
of
course,
is
whether
the
court
has
legislative...
the
first
full
faith
and
credit
question
is
whether
the
court
in
which
the
suit
is
brought
has
legislative
jurisdiction.
so
there
is
a
requirement
that
that
state
have
constitutionally
sufficient
contacts
with
the
law--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--so
assuming
that
they've
satisfied
that,
they
are
entitled
to
bring
a
suit.
then
the
question
is
whether
the
state...
and
i...
and
i
believe
at
that
point
the
state
is
free
to
apply
its
own
laws
to
protect
its
own
interests.
i
think
that's
what
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
allows.
and
it
is
the
doctrine
of
comity
that
provides
the
acknowledgment
of
the
state...
the
other
state's
interests.
and
that's
typically,
in
fact,
what's
happened
with
nevada--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--versus--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--well,
there
are
two...
two
factors
there,
justice
kennedy.
first
of
all,
there
is
the
fact
that
nevada
has
some
very
real
interests
of
its
own,
its
own
sovereign
interests
to
protect
here.
i
mean,
there
have
been
torts
which
were
both
committed
in
nevada
and
directed
at
a
nevada
resident.
so,
to
begin
with,
before
one
gets
to
the
immunity
question,
nevada,
as
a
sovereign
state,
has
important
interests
in
assuring
compensation
and
also
in
deterring
that
kind
of
conduct.
so
the
idea
that
a
legislatively
created
immunity
by
another
state
should
be
able
to
prevent
nevada
from
protecting
those
interests
seems
inconsistent
with
the
federal
system.
now,
if
one
goes
beyond
that
to
the
question
of
inherent
immunity,
the
very
idea
that
a
state
should
have
to
be
subject
to
sue
in
the
courts
of
another
state,
i
think,
first
of
all,
as
you
know,
we
don't
believe
that
issue
is
properly
presented
on
the
question
presented
in
this
case.
but
if
you
would
like
me
to
address
it
just
for
a
moment,
i
think
there...
there
are
differences
if
one
looks
to
the...
to
the
way
that
the...
essentially
immunity
has
been
resolved
in...
in
the
course
of...
of
the
united
states.
first
of
all,
in
its
own
courts,
it
has
the
common-law
immunity
based
on
the
idea
that
it
is
both
the
king
being
sued
in
its
own
court,
and
also
typically
it
is
also
the
progenitor
of
the
law,
so
to
speak,
to
justice
holmes'
point.
in
the
united
states,
there's...
the
courts
of
the
united
states,
there's
a
very
specific
situation.
at
the
time
of
the
convention,
the
states
were,
obviously,
forming
a
new
sovereign,
and
the
question
of
whether
that
sovereign
was
going
to
grant
them
the
immunity
they
had
in
their
own
courts
or
whether
that
sovereign
would
be
in
the
same
position
essentially
as
foreign
sovereigns
typically
were,
which
is
that
they
did
not
have
to
provide
sovereignty
except
as
a
matter
of
comity.
that's
the
schooner
exchange
opinion.
but...
so
the
states,
at
that
point,
had
a
very
real
interest
in
deciding
that
question,
and
they
did,
in
fact,
decide
that
question,
as
the
court
has
recognized.
that
is
not
true
with
respect
to
the
immunity
that
they
have
had
in
the
courts
of
other
states.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
uh-huh.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
okay,
i
think
that
is
not
a
question
that
is
within
the
notion
of
what
is
the
question
in
this
case.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i'm
sorry.
i--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--excuse
me.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
no,
i--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--i'm
sorry.
i
started
to
answer
in
the
wrong
way.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
what
i...
i
reserve
the
point,
of
course,
always,
that
i
don't
believe
this
is
within
the
question
presented.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
but
i
actually
was
going...
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
i
don't
think
it's
the
same
kind
of
question
in
the
sense
that
i
think
still
when
you're
talking
about
enforcement
of
a
federal
cause
of
action
in
another
state,
that
is
still
really
a
federal-state
question.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that's
still--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--an
evolving
question.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
think
that
is--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--still
a
federal-state--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--i
think
that
is
still
a
federal-state
issue.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that's
right.
and--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--well--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--that's
correct.
actually,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that's
something
that
the
court,
to
some
extent,
addressed
in
alden
itself--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--in
distinguishing
the
opinion
in
nevada
versus
hall,
when
it
noted
that
when
you
get
into
the
situation
of
a
state
being
sued
in
the
courts
of
another
state
and,
as
in
nevada
versus
hall,
under
a
state
cause
of
action,
you
have
now
implicated
the
sovereignty
of
a
second
sovereign.
so
when
one
is
now
looking
at
the...
at
the
issues
of
sovereign
immunity,
one
is
looking
at
a
different
platform
of
issues
and
also
at
a
different
historical
base.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--i
mean,
i
think
that
there
are
two
things
going
on.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
the
question
is
not
whether
they
can
be
sued,
but
if
not,
why
not.
for
example,
with
pennsylvania
and
virginia,
as
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware,
had
a...
nathan
versus
virginia
is
a
case
in
which
that
very
situation
came
up.
but
in
the
courts
of
pennsylvania,
the
pennsylvania
attorney
general
urged
its
own
courts
to
recognize
sovereign
immunity.
so
that
could
naturally
fit
within
the
idea
that
schooner
exchange
had
made
clear,
which
is
that
when
you're
talking
about
coequal
sovereigns
of
that
nature,
one
is
talking
about
sovereignty
that...
excuse
me,
immunity
that
is
extended
as
a
matter
of
comity,
not
as
a
matter
of
absolute
right
of
the
other
sovereign.
and
the
reason
is...
excuse
me...
the
reason
is
that
if
you
don't
allow
the
sovereign
to
execute
its
own
laws
within
its
own
territory,
you're
depriving
that
sovereign
of
part
of
its
sovereignty.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
it
bears
a
little
bit.
but,
of
course,
article
iii
itself
is
not
a
exclusive
jurisdiction
provision.
the
section
1251
provides
exclusive
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
suits
between
states.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
and
they...
certainly
as
a
practical
matter,
they
would
have
been
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
mean,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
has
always
been
difficult
to
bring
a
suit
against
a
state,
either
in
its
own
courts
or
in
the
courts
of
another
state.
i
mean,
even
since
nevada
versus
hall,
typically
states
have
granted
immunity
to
other
states
for
when
they're
sued
in
their
own
courts.
and
if
they
haven't
granted
absolute
immunity,
what
they
have
done,
which
i
think
is
an
important
principle
emerging...
emerging
principle
of
comity,
is
they
have
tended
to
look
at
their
own
immunity
to
see
what
kinds
of
suits
could
be
brought
against
them
and
to
try,
then,
to
grant
to
the...
to
the
outside
sovereign
that
same
type
of
immunity.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--it's
relatively
rare,
and...
but
there
have
been
some
suits.
there
are
a
few
of
them
cited
in
our
red
brief,
if
i
can
find
the
page
number,
pages
38
and
39.
the...
there
are
suits,
for
example,
negligence
suits
involving
the
release
of
dangerous
persons
within
another
state
who
have
created
injury
to
citizens--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--of
that
state.
there
are
more
commercial-type
things
involving
contracts
or...
one,
in
particular,
is
a
it
for
invasion
of
privacy
when
someone
who
wrote
a
book
disclosed
information.
in
general,
though,
justice
o'connor,
as
i
say,
some
of
those
suits,
the
courts
have
just
said,
we're
not
going
to
hear
them
whether
you
have
a
valid
cause
of
action
or
not.
we're
simply
not
going
to...
going
to
recognize
that
in
our
courts
because
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
defendant.
other
courts
have
said,
yes,
we
will
open
our
courts,
but
we
are
going
to
look
to
our
own
immunity
to
try
to
have
essentially
a
baseline
to
measure
the
sort
of
immunity
that
we
are
going
to--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--accept.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
do
think
that
that's--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--just
a
matter--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--if
one
granted
lesser
immunity?
is
that
the
question--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--if
a
state
is
entitled
as
a
defendant
to
invoke
privileges
and
immunities
against
the
courts
in
another
state,
i
would
think
that's
right.
certainly
in
the
case--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--i--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--i
would
have
thought
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
no,
i...
that
would
be
my
assumption,
also,
justice
souter.
i
think
that
the...
the
privileges
and
immunities
and
equal
protection
are...
are
provisions
that
apply
to
individuals
who
are
claiming
discrimination
in...
in
another
state.
i
don't
think
they
would
apply
directly
to
a
state.
but,
as
i
say,
the...
the
notion
that
comity
is...
is
something
that...
that
doesn't
have
a
force,
even
though
it's
not
federal
enforceable,
it
seems
to
me
is
a
little
bit
of
a
misperception.
because,
again,
if
one
goes
back
to
the
notion
of
the
law
of
nations
or
separate
sovereigns,
comity
essentially
has
been
the
provision
that
governs
their
relations
since
well
before
the
convention.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
i
mean,
let
me
suggest
a
couple
of
other
possibilities,
justice
kennedy,
as
well.
i
don't...
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
would
take
original
jurisdiction
of
that
question
or
not,
but,
i
mean,
the
most
direct
example
of
something
states
could
do,
obviously,
is
they
could
reach
agreements
between
themselves.
i
mean,
there
have
been
two
cases
before
this
court
involving
suits
against
states
in
the
courts
of
other
states.
one
was
nevada
in
california's
courts.
this
is
california
in
nevada's
courts.
if
those
states,
who
are
neighboring
states,
feel
that
this
is
an
issue
that
they
need
to
address,
they
could
reach
some
sort
of
agreement
and,
therefore,
have
reciprocal
legislation.
and,
for
example,
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
for
years,
as
the
court
may
know,
there
is
a
doctrine
that
said
that
states
didn't
have
to
enforce
the
penal
laws
of
another
state,
even
though
full
faith
and
credit,
on
its
face,
would
make
you
feel
that
maybe
they
would
have.
but,
in
fact,
states
eventually
began,
through
reciprocal
agreements
in
decisions,
and
i
think
in
legislation
also,
saying,
you
know,
we
essentially
will
enforce
the
penal
laws
and
the
tax
laws
of
other
states,
so
long
as
they
do
for
us.
so,
again,
the
states--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--no,
no,
penal
judgments,
the
court
said
in...
in
milwaukee
county,
have
to
be
enforced,
but
they...
they
distinguished
at
that
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
idea
that
a
law
itself
would
have
to
be
in
force
before
it
had
been
reduced
to--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
and...
and--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--if
i
may--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--if
i
may
intercede,
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
a
compact.
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--it's
agreements
that
have
to
be
proven.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
right,
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
there
could--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--it's--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--it
seems
exhaustive--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--well,
comity--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--excuse
me...
comity
is--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--yeah,
i
mean--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--excuse
me.
i
don't...
i
certainly
don't
mean
to
minimize
the
theoretical
possibility
that
suits
in
courts
of
one
state
could
ultimately
prove
to
be
a
problem,
generally.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
there
is
nothing,
first
of
all,
in
the
history
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
that
would
suggest
that
once
a
state
has
proper
legislative
jurisdiction,
as
i
think
everybody
concedes
that
nevada
does
here,
that
somehow
that
clause
was
intended
to
displace
the
law
of
that
state
simply
because
another
state
had
made
different
policy
choices
about,
let's
say,
here,
compensation
and
immunity.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
what...
the
permutations
and
facts,
i
think,
go
particularly
to
what
constitutes
legislative
jurisdiction.
so
perhaps
in
that
sense,
my
statement
is
broader,
or
seems
broader
in
the
context
of
this
case
than
i
mean
it
to
be.
but
i
do...
but
i
do
think,
in
general,
that
i
don't
see
any
warrant
in
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
given
the
fact
that
it
was
enacted
with
very
little
debate,
and
almost
all
of
the
debate
was
about
judgments
and
not
about
enforcement
of
other
states'
laws,
i
think
it
would
be
stretching
the
clause
beyond
recognition
to
say
that
at
some
point
it
was...
it
was
telling
states,
you're
going
to
have
to
set
your
laws
aside
and
apply
the
laws
of
another
state.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that's
correct.
and
as
i
think
my
argument
might
suggest,
i
think
the
court
was
correct
to
essentially
back
away
from
that
kind
of
balancing
test
and
essentially
go
back
to
the
principle
of
saying
when
a
state
is
competent
to
legislate,
then
it
may
apply
its
own
laws,
leaving
the
additional
questions
about
what
might
happen
at
that
point
to
questions
comity
where
a
state
is
the
defendant.
and,
as
i've
suggested,
nevada
courts
have
shown
considerable
comity
already
here,
and
the
case,
of
course,
is
not
yet
concluded.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that's...
that's
true
in
one
sense,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
mean,
when
i
say
it's
not...
that
there's
no
federally
enforceable
state
law
of
comity,
i...
that's
true.
but
at
the
same
time,
i
mean,
the
court's
decisions
about
comity
since
back
in
the
last
18th
century
have
emphasized
that
it
is
a
serious
doctrine.
it's
a
doctrine
built
of
respect
for...
for
other
sovereigns.
and
in
particular...
and
i
think
this...
this
is...
also
goes
to
the
practical
problem
that
justices
kennedy
and
breyer
are
asking
about...
it
also
does
have
a
healthy
measure
of
self
interest
in
it.
i
mean,
when...
when
you
are
talking
about
coequal
sovereigns,
any
sovereign
that
is
exercising
jurisdiction
over
another
sovereign
understands
that
that's...
the
first
sovereign...
or
the
second
sovereign
has
the
same
power
and
authority
over
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
don't
believe
so
state
versus
state,
justice
o'connor.
or
course,
in
the...
in
the
types
of
cases
that
the
board
was
referring
to
this
morning,
like
mcnary,
there
are
comity
elements.
and
there...
and
there
is
a
jurisprudence
of
this
court
with
respect
to
federal
and
state
relations
which
does
depend
on
comity,
and
that
is,
of
course,
federally
enforceable.
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
concomitant
enforceable
doctrine--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--state
to
state.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
suppose
i
should--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--well,
i...
i
mean,
i'm...
i
suppose
i
should
pause
in
the
sense
that...
that
if
there
is
something
that
is
so
threatening
to
the
constitutional
structure
and
something
for
which
there
is
no
historical
basis
in...
in
terms
of
the...
the
way
that
sovereigns
deal
with
each
other.
now,
see,
that's...
that's
where
i
think
this
case
is
very
different,
because
even
though
there
was
certainly
a
practical
tradition
that
states
were
not
to
be
sued
in
other
states,
as
i
say,
since
schooner
exchange,
and,
indeed,
in
the
verlinden
in
1980,
this
court
has
always
taken
the
position
that
when
you're
talking
about
relationships
between
sovereigns,
and
they're
coequal
sovereigns,
and
the
issue
is
immunity
between
them,
that
is
a
matter
of
comity.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
as...
i
don't
think,
to
start
with,
that
the
answer
is
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
mean--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--right.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
i
mean,
i
still
think
that,
in
the
end,
the
answer
is
that
this
is
a
matter
that
one
trusts
to
the
judgment
of
states--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--that
if,
in
fact,
there
is
a
question
about
discovery,
that--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--i
mean,
that
i...
accepting
the
characterization,
although
i
dispute
it
to
some
extent,
but
to
the
extent
there's
a
question
about
discovery,
that
is
simply
part
and
parcel
of
the
states
being
able
to
exercise
their
jurisdiction.
i
don't--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--well,
there's
certainly
nothing
specifically
in
the
question
presented
about
discovery.
the...
the...
the...
again,
to
come
back
to
the
question
presented,
because
we've
discussed
a
wide
range
of
issues,
most
of
which
i
don't
think
are
within
the
question
presented,
but
when
we
come
back
to
the
question
presented,
the
question
is
basically
was
the
nevada
or
the
nevada
courts
required
to
dismiss
this
action
on
summary
judgment
because
of
california's
law
of
immunity?
and...
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because,
according
to
california,
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
requires
nevada
to
enforce
california's
law
of
immunity.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
our
view
is...
yeah?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
and,
in
fact,
they
have
become
more
specific
in
applying
comity,
i
believe,
in
saying
we
want
to
treat
the
other
sovereign
as
we
do
treat
ourselves,
not
just
as
we
want
to
be
treated.
we
are
treating
the
other
sovereign
the
way
we
treat
ourselves.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
certainly
think
that's
possible.
and,
of
course,
as
i've
said,
i
mean,
california
can
try
to
talk
to
nevada
and
try
to
reach
agreement
at
a
sovereign
level
about
this,
or
if,
in
fact...
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
has
a
specific
express
commitment
to
congress
of
the
right
to
declare
the
effects
of
other
laws.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
the...
i
suppose,
i
mean,
based
on
what
california
has
said
before...
said
up
to
now,
it
would
bring
it
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
that
it
would
say
that
there
is
some
requirement--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--that's
correct.
i
mean,
whether
they're--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--i
mean,
the
question
would
be,
is
there...
obviously,
the
question
that's
being
raised.
i
am
not
aware
of
the
federal
substantive
standard--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--that
says--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--that's
correct.
now,
you
do
have...
there
are
certain
cases,
in
fact,
in
which
you
can't
have
overlapping
jurisdiction,
where
you
can't
own
the
same
water,
you
can't
own
the
same
land,
you
can't
escheat
the
same
property.
so
that's
true.
the
court
has
addressed
those
kinds
of
cases.
in
a
situation
where
you're
simply
saying
another
state
is
applying
its
laws,
i
prefer
that
they
apply
our
laws,
and
i'm
troubled
by
the
discovery
that
they
have...
they
have
allowed
in
applying
their
own
laws,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
federal
principle--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--is
that
entitles
you
to
stop
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
it...
in
fact,
the
nevada
court
dismissed
the
declaratory
judgment
action
precisely
because
it
didn't
want
to
get
into
the
question
that
was
at
issue
in
the
california
proceeding.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
most
of
the...
most
of
the
other
material...
with
one
exception,
most
of
the
other
issues
involved
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
california
inquiry.
i
mean,
whether
confidential
information
has
been
improperly
disclosed
has...
is
not...
does
not
require
you
to
adjudicate
the
california
tax
liability
in
order
to
understand
that.
the
only
thing
that
has
any
bearing
that
is
close
to
that,
i
submit,
is
something
that
is
roughly
akin
to
like
a
malicious
prosecution
suit.
and
tort
law
itself,
over
time,
takes
care
of
that.
we've
not
gotten
to
that
issue
yet
in
the
nevada
supreme
court.
