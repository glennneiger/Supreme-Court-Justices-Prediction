mr.
felix
leatherwood
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
has
prompted
the
nevada
courts
to
extend
their
authority
over
california's
tax
process.
the
nevada
court
has
said
at
joint
appendix
138,
the
entire
process,
of
ftb
audits
of
hyatt,
including
the
ftb's
assessment
of
taxes
and
the
protests,
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
end
quote.
this
has
been
said
to
mean,
at
joint
appendix
138,
that
the
tax
process
is
under
attack.
this
lawsuit
interferes
with
california's
capacity
to
administer
these
taxes.
the
administration
of
taxes
is
a
core,
sovereign
responsibility
from
which
all
functions
of
state
government
depend
on.
it
is
protected
by
immunity
laws
of
common-law
tort
lawsuits,
like
the
kind
presented
by
respondent.
california
has
invoked
the
protection
of
its
immunity
laws,
but
the
nevada
courts
have
allowed
respondents
laws
to
proceed,
not
by
extending
full
faith
and
credit.
and
this
refusal
threatens
our
constitutional
system
for
cooperative
federalism
in
violation
of
article
iv,
section
1
of
the
united
states
code.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
justice
ginsberg,
we
do
not
join
in
the
chorus
to
overrule
nevada
v.
hall.
this
case
is
different.
this
case
goes
to
footnote
24
of
nevada
v.
hall.
it's
our
feeling
that
nevada
v.
hall
is
good
law
in
the
sense
it
does...
it
does
not
implicate
another
state
managing
another
state's
core
sovereign
function.
it's...
nevada
v.
hall
was
strictly
an
automobile
accident.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
i
mean,
compared...
i
thank
you,
your
honor...
in
comparing
the
sovereign
functions--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--yeah,
and
driving
an
automobile
in
another
state's...
on
another
state's
highway--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--that's
not--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--the
sovereign
function.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
well,
to
answer
the
court's
question
directly,
the
most
significant
difference
is
that
the
tax
function
is...
is
much
more
significant
than
the
education
function.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
well--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--no,
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
that
would
be
a
difficult--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
arguing
that
education
is
not
a
core
sovereign
function.
what
i'm
arguing
is
that
taxation
is
an
essential
core
sovereign
function
since
that
education
cannot
move
forward--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--to
provide
taxation.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
yes,
your
honor.
justice
o'connor,
what
we
are
attempting
to
say
here
is
that
this
case
is
more
analogous
to
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
the
area
of
the
federal
tax
injunction
act
along
the
line
of
fair
assessment...
the
fair
assessment
cases,
where
the
court
has
directed
that
the
federal
government
will
back
off
on
trying
to
manage
state
taxes.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
but
we
do
have
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
which
directs
that
a
state
is
to
recognize
the
public
acts
of
another
state.
and
we
do
have
an
immunity
law
applicable
here,
and
this
directs
that
nevada
should
respect
the
immunity
laws
of
the
state
of
california.
and
the
immunity
law,
in
this
particular
instance,
provide
absolute
immunity
for
conduct
as
undertaken
in
a...
in
a
tax
audit.
anything
that's
associated
with
tax
audit,
is
protected.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
absolutely,
i
agree
with
the
court
on
that
point.
the--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--the
extension
of
that--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--because
the
extension
of
our
immunity
law
does
not
cover
physical
torts
or
torts--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--outside
the
scope--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--of
course,
the
scope
of...
of
the...
the
acts
that
are
incidental
to--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--well,
in
fact,
your
honor,
if
they
would
use
the
nevada
standard,
use
the
same
standard
that
nevada
applies
to
its
own
taxing
agencies,
then
this
case
would
be
on
a
hold.
what
nevada
has
done
in
this
particular
case
is
that
it
has
gone
outside
its
own
precedent
and
applied
a
different
standard
to
california
taxing
agencies,
and
it's
not--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--your
honor,
i
am
not
asking
this
court
to
not
believe
the
nevada
supreme
court.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
nevada
has
published
precedent,
as
recent
as
1989,
where
it
requires
that
a
taxpayer
forego
bringing
a
lawsuit
until
they...
until
there
has
been...
until
there's
a
resolution
of
all
statutory
procedures.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
your
honor,
what
has
happened
in
this
particular
case,
97
percent
of
the
conduct
that
occurred
during
the
course
of
this
audit
occurred
in
california.
and,
quite
naturally,
what
nevada
is...
what
nevada
is
doing
is
permitting
mr.
hyatt
to
go
behind
the
actual
tort
and
make
a
collateral
attack
on
the
tax
itself.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
i
would
absolutely
agree
with
the
court
that
the
issue
whether
or
not
nevada
was
obligated
to
apply
our
immunity
laws
with
respect--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--with
respect
to
conduct
undertaken
incidental
to
this
audit.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
your
honor,
no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that,
under
that
particular
theory,
i
do
not
think
that
you
could
pass
law
in
the
state
of
california
that
will
essentially
sanction
a
crime,
and
there
was
no
crimes
committed
within
the
course
of
this
audit.
if
the...
if
an
auditor
commits
an
intentional
tort,
such
as
a
burglary
or
a
trespass
in
nevada
or
in
california,
it's...
it's
our
position
that
that
particular
conduct
is
not
incidental
to--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--well...
well,
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
my
position
is
that
even
though
that
law
does
not
exist
in
california--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--but
applying--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--applying
it...
my...
our
particular
theory--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--that,
yes,
we...
then
nevada
would
be
obligated
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
to
apply
that
particular
law.
but--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--if--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--if
that
were...
if
that
was
the
case.
but--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--in
this
particular
case,
that's
illegal
in
california
and
that's
illegal
in
nevada.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
no,
and
we're
agreeing
with
nevada
v.
hall.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
yes,
i--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--that's
not
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
if
that
conduct...
if
that
conduct
is
connected
to
the
actual
audit
itself,
then
it's
protected.
but
what
i'm
saying,
i
cannot
possibly
see,
under
any
possible
theory,
that
a
beating,
that
it...
that
breaking
into
someone's
house
could
actually
be
part
of
the
assessment...
tax
assessment
process.
if
an
auditor
engages
in
that
kind
of
behavior,
the
auditor
is
not
covered
under
the
absolute
immunity.
that
is
outside
the
scope
of
that--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--of
that
statute.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
well--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--well,
i
think
it's
both,
your
honor.
well,
first
of
all,
tax...
tax
collection,
by
definition,
is
an
intrusion
of
someone's
life.
the
allegations
alleged
here
are
principally
invasion
of
privacy,
disclosure
of
information,
that
sort
of
thing.
ninety-seven
percent
of
that
conduct
occurred
in
california.
you
cannot
possibly
investigate
or
prosecute
mr.
hyatt's
case
without
intruding
into
that
tax--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--absolutely,
your
honor.
that...
but...
but--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--well,
your
honor,
in
this
particular
case,
as
i've
indicated,
according
to
our
reading
of
nevada
precedent,
published
precedent,
that
they
would
not
permit
this
lawsuit
to
proceed
until
the
tax
process
has
been
concluded.
with
respect
to...
to
directly
answer
your
question,
it
does
not
appear
that
nevada
would
prosecute
its
own...
it
will
permit
a
prosecution
of
its
own
agents
in
the
case
where
the
allegations
are
principally
that
there
is
an
intrusion
into
mr.
hyatt's
life
or
that
there--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--no,
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
you
misread
the
opinion.
what
i
think
the
nevada
supreme
court
said
is
that
they
will
permit
intentional
tort
prosecution
of
government
employees.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
government
employee.
this
case
involves
a
government
agency
itself,
a
tax
agency.
and
under
nevada
law,
you
cannot
proceed
against
the
nevada
tax
agency
without
first
exhausting
your
administrative
and
statutory
remedies
to
contest
the
underlying
tax
itself.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
absolutely,
your
honor.
in
our...
in
our...
it
is
our
position
that
this
entire...
the
entire
lawsuit
is
linked
up
to
our
tax
process,
because
the
conduct
that
the
respondent
is
complaining
about
here
is
that
the
tax
itself
is...
the
tax
itself
and
the
tax
process
is
engaged
in
bad
faith.
and
i
would--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--part--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--i
think,
under
nevada
v.
hall,
he
would
be...
he
would
be
subject
to
negligent
liability.
it's
not
connected
to
a
core
silent
function
because
the
function
here
is...
the
function
here
is
a
tax
investigation,
whereas,
driving
is
something
that
you
can
investigate
independent
of
the
tax
process
itself.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
your
honor--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--well,
we...
we've
thought
about
this,
your
honor,
of
course,
and
we
would
accept
a
win,
if
that's
the
court's
direction,
through
overruling
nevada
v.
hall,
but
it's
our
contention
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
go
that
far
to
get...
to
get
to
this
point.
the
court
can
literally
analogize
to
the
special
protections
that
are
provided
to
state
tax
systems
within
the
federal
system
itself.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
agree
with
that.
of
course,
we
think
that
nevada's
failure
to
recognize
or
give
dignity
to
california's
immunity
statute
is
not
only
a
violation
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
but
is
a
hostile
act,
and
this
kind
of
hostility
is
contrary
to
our
whole
concept
of--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--well,
that
still
creates...
that
still
creates
the
situation
where
nevada
is
supervising
and
managing
california's
tax
practices.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
yeah.
in
this
lawsuit...
this
lawsuit
is...
is
being
prosecuted...
is
being
investigated
almost
exclusively
in
california.
the...
the
intrusion
here,
the
interference
here,
is
that
nevada
has
permitted
mr.
hyatt
to
use
this
lawsuit
both
as
a...
as
a
wall
and
a
battering
ram.
it
has
almost
suppressed
the
entire
california
tax
investigation.
it's
creating
an
entire
class
of
possible
plaintiffs
that
can
sue
california
just
for
literally
going
across
the
state
line
and
making
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
a
former
california
resident,
a
former
california
taxpayer,
actually
owes
any
taxes.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
well,
the
intentional
act
here
is
that
california
created
a
tax
system
in
bad
faith
to...
bad
faith
to
extort
an
exit...
an
exit
tax
from...
from
a
taxpayer.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
yeah,
and
i
would...
i
would
direct
the
court
to
joint
appendix
133,
where...
where
the
court
would...
the
nevada
courts
have
indicated
that
almost
all
the
action
in
this...
in
this
lawsuit
occurred
in
california.
and--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--actually,
your
honor--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--actually,
your
honor,
i
believe
there
were
three
trips,
and
they
were
short
trips...
they
were
trips
of
extremely
short
duration.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
well,
that's
not
part
of...
that's
not
part
of
the
allegations
of
the...
of
the
complaint
itself.
the
complaint
is
saying
that--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--no,
there
has
been
deposition
testimony
that
there...
on
one
of
the
trips,
that
the
investigator
looked
at
the
timing
of
mr....
of
respondent's
trash
delivery
and
also
looked
at...
determined
whether
or
not
respondent
was
receiving
any
mail
at
that
particular
location.
that
does
not
justify
the
pervasive
nature
and
the
extent
in
which
this
lawsuit
has
reached
into
california
and
literally
attacked
the
tax
process.
and,
once
again,
i
will
refer
the
court
to
the
joint
appendix
at
page
60,
where
it
is
alleged
that
the
california
tax
system
itself
is
a...
is
a
fraud...
that
is,
put
together
in
bad
faith
for
the
specific
purpose
of
extorting
an
exit
tax
from
former
residents
who...
as
they
leave
california.
well,
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions
in
this
regard,
i
would
like--
mr.
felix
leatherwood
--reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
thank
you.
mr.
felix
leatherwood
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
thumbscrew
example.
i
don't
think
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
would
actually
force
cal...
force
nevada
to
apply...
apply
a
california
thumbscrew
statute,
because
that
would
actually
be
outside
the
tax
function.
what
i'm
saying
in
this
particular
case
what
has
happened
is
that
nevada's
failure
to
give
us
back
to
california's
immunity
statute
has
resulted
in
interference
with
california's
tax
system.
if
this
court
does
not
intervene
and
give
us
back
to
our
particular
proposed
test,
which
would
look
into
california
to
see
whether
or
not
we
would
grant
immunity,
then
essentially
that
would
permit
any
defendant
any
form
of
taxpayer
to
run
to
the
border
and
literally
sue
the
state
of
california
or
any
other
state
to
prevent
the
enforcement
of
that
particular
statute.
in
addition,
i
pointed
out
that
this
gives
another
state
the
power
to
intrude
into
the
actual
operation
of
another
state,
and
that's
what
has
happened
here.
there
has
been
some...
some
discussion
as
to
whether
or
not
nevada
has
legislative
jurisdiction.
we
concede
that
they
have
legislative
jurisdiction
over
the
tort.
but
we...
what
we
complain
about
is
that
they
won't
respect
our
legislative
jurisdiction
or
our
tax
process
over
our
immunity
laws,
and
that
is
our
particular
complaint.
we
submit
the
case.
