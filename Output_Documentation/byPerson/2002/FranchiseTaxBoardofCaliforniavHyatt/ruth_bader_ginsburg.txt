justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
leatherwood,
may
i
ask
you
a
threshold
question?
some
of
your
friends
in
this
case
have
invited
an
overruling
of
nevada
against
hall.
of
course,
california
was
favored
by
that
decision.
do
you
join
in
the
plea
to
overrule
nevada
v.
hall,
or
do
you
say
this
case
is
different
because
it
involves
four
sovereign
functions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
mr.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--leatherwood,
we...
this
court
tried
to
follow
a
core
state
function
test
under
the
tenth
amendment.
and
in
garcia,
kind
of
gave
it
up,
didn't
it,
as
being
an
unworkable
thing.
now,
why
would
we
want
to
resurrect
that
here?
and
why
is
it
that
you
don't
say,
well,
if
the
court
wants
to
overrule
nevada
v.
hall,
that's
fine;
i'll
win.
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
your
position.
you're
asking
us
to
go
back
to
a
test
that
we
rejected
under
the
tenth
amendment
in
garcia,
but
you
don't
want
to
say,
sure,
if
you
want
to
overrule
nevada
v.
hall,
be
my
guest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
what
they're...
the
nevada
court
said,
we're
going
to
treat
the
tax
collectors
from
anywhere
who
come
in
to
our
state
and
act
here,
and
we're
going
to...
the
nevada
supreme
court
said,
we're
going
to
apply
our
rule,
and
our
rule
is
negligence
is
immunity;
intentional,
there
isn't.
so
you're
asking
us
to
discredit
or
disbelieve
the
nevada
supreme
court
when
it
said,
the
law
we
apply
to
tax
collectors
who
act
in
this
state
is
the
same
as
we
apply
to
nevada
tax
collectors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
but
this...
but
nevada
supreme
court,
i
thought,
made
very
clear
that
what
they
were
dealing
with
is
tortious
conduct,
harassing
conduct.
they,
in
fact,
refused...
nevada
supreme
court
refused
to
decide
where
this
man
was
domiciled,
because
that
would
interfere
with
the
ongoing
procedure
in
california
on
the
tax
liability.
i
thought
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
had
made
it
clear
that
they
were
dealing
with
the
way
their
resident
is
being
harassed
and
not
with
where
he
was
domiciled
on
a
magic
date.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
that,
again,
the
nevada
supreme
court
said,
we
are
not
going
to
touch
the
question
of
where
this
man
was
domiciled.
that's
for
california
to
decide.
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
this
new
thing.
one
allegation
was
trespass
and
going
through
the
man's
trash,
and
another
was
calling...
maybe
the
calls
emanated
in
california...
calling
people
in
nevada
insinuating
bad
things
about
this
person.
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
where
the
man
is
domiciled.
it's
a
question
that
california
is
deciding
and
nevada
says
it
won't
touch.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you...
you
recognized
that
there
were
two
trips
into
california.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
to
nevada.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
was
there
about...
on
one
of
those
trips,
there
was
a
trespass
on
his
property
and
rummaging
through
his
trash.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
a
more...
a
more
general
interference
with
his
privacy,
but
those
were
examples
that
were
alleged,
if
not
in
the
complaint,
somewhere.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
farr,
are
you
saying--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
that,
too,
is
just
a
matter
of
comity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
doesn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--doesn't
the
privileges
and
immunity
clause
of
article
iv
have
something
to
say?
if
you
can
treat
a
tax
collector
from
california
differently
than
the
tax
collector
in
nevada,
you're
not
giving
their
tax
collectors
equal
privileges
and
immunities
in
nevada.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
if
one...
you
said
that
the
only
stopper
was
a
notion
of
comity,
and
i'm
suggesting
that
you
might
not
be
able
to
treat
two
officials,
one
from
out
of
state,
one
from
in
state,
to
treat...
to
favor
the
in-state
official.
but
maybe
privileges
and
immunities
have...
has
something
to
do
with
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
clapper
and
bradford.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
discovery
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--interlocutory.
i
thought
that
we
couldn't
write
in
an
opinion,
as
justice
breyer
has
suggested,
if
i
didn't
think
that
that
question
was
currently
reviewable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
simply
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
simply
that
it's
a
prior
action
pending.
that's
what
makes
this
case
different,
and
one
of
the
things
that
makes
it
different
from
nevada
v.
hall.
why
is
it...
is
the
california
proceeding
ongoing?
isn't
it
normal
for
a
second
court
to
stay
its
operations
so
it
won't
interfere
with
that
prior
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
what
about
the
intrusive
discovery?
