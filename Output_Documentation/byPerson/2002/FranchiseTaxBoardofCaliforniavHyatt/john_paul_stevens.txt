i

so
under
california
law,
there
would
be...
that
would
be
actionable;
whereas,
under
nevada
law,
here,
what
they're
doing
is
actionable.
you
just
want
to
use
the
california
standard
rather...
rather
than
the
nevada
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
leatherwood,
if
i
understand
your
position,
it
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
a
hundred
percent
of
the
conduct
had
occurred
in
nevada.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
problem
i
have...
may
i
just
ask
this
question.
assume
there
is
a...
there's
a
difference
between
nevada
law
and
california
law,
as
i
understand
it.
some
things
are
actionable
against
a
tax
people
in
one
state
and
not
the
other.
why
is
it,
in
your
view,
that
if
the
same
conduct
had
occurred
six
months
later,
but
by
nevada
tax
collectors
instead
of
by
california
tax
collectors,
because
he's
been
in
both
states
and
probably
is
subject
to
tax
in
both,
nevada
would
allow
the
suit
against
its
own
tax
people
but
now
allow
it
against
the
california
tax
people?
why
does
that
make
sense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
understood
the
reasoning
of
the
nevada
supreme
court
to
say
they
would.
i
think...
i
must
have
misread
the
opinion.
is
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
farr,
can
i
ask
you,
do
you
think
they
were
compelled
by
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
to
grant
immunity
on
the
negligence
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
arguing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
farr--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
i
understand...
your
comity
argument
basically
is...
it's
kind
a
self-executing
thing,
because
each
time
a
state
has
to
answer
the
comity
question,
it
asks
the
question,
what
would
i
do
if
the
tables
were
reversed?
and
as
history
teaches
us,
they
generally
treat
the
other
sovereign
the
way
they
would
want
to
be
treated
themselves.
and
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
that's
the
rule
that
seems
to
have
been
developed
without
any
overriding
constitutional
command
order
here.
