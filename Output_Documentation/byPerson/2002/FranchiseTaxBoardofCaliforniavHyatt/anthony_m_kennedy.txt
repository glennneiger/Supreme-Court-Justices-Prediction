justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's...
that...
that...
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
premise
for
us
to
say,
that
education
is
somehow
secondary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're...
you're
saying
nevada
can't
have
a
great
university...
can
have
a
great
university
by
keeping
its
people
within
its
own
borders.
they
can't
go
to
california
to
get
information
to
solicit,
to
recruit
students?
that...
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
decision
for
us
to
write
on
that
premise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
the
state
of
california
to
argue
that
education
is
not
a
core
state
function
is,
to
me,
rather
astounding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
do
you
agree
on
that
point?
i
don't
understand
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
principles
of
comity
dictated
by
the
constitution?
suppose--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
nevada
said
they
were
not
going
to
grant
comity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
your
position
then
the
private
plaintiff
can
always
bring
suit
against
a
state
in
the
courts
of
another
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
under
due
precedent.
well,
that's
easy
to
satisfy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it's
very
odd
to
me
that
california
can't
be
sued
in
its
own
courts
and
it
can't
be
sued
in
a
federal
court,
but
it
can
be
sued
in
a
nevada
court,
which,
if
we
follow
that,
the
question
really
is
has
the...
has
the
least
interest
in
maintaining
the
dignity
of
the
state
of
california.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
seems
to
make
their
case
even
harder.
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
that
the
framers
thought
that
virginia
could
be
sued
in
pennsylvania
but
not
in
the
federal
court.
i
would
think
that
the
presumption
would
be
that
this
was
an
even
stronger
case
for
the
exercise
of
sovereign
immunity
than
when
all
of
the
citizens
of
the
union
are
involved
as
in
the
alden
situation--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
the
eleventh
amendment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
is
some
reluctance
to
say
that
california
officials
can
run
amok
in
nevada
without
nevada
being
able
to
do
anything
about
it.
i
suppose
if
it
were
a
pervasive
practice,
nevada
might
be
able
to
sue
california
in
the
original
jurisdiction
under
some
parens
patriae
theory.
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
be
the
underlying--
--underlying--
--substantive
law
in
justice
souter's
proposed
original
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
we
wouldn't
need
an
original
action
for
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
if
that's
so,
it
could
apply
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
what's
the...
what
would
an
original
action...
there
was...
there's
no
underlying
substantive
standard
to
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
leatherwood,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
