mr.
farr,
have
you
found
other
examples
around
the
country
of
suits
by
citizens
of
one
state
against
another
state
in
the
other
state's
courts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this
relatively
rare,
or
is
it
happening?
and
in
what
context
is
it
happening?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is...
is
the
question
of
comity
one
that
has
a
federal
component
so
that
this
court
should
weigh
in
on
when
it
has
to
be
exercised?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--even
in
the
face...
even
in
the
face
of
some
development
by
state...
a
state
court
that
seems
totally
out
of
whack
with
our
constitutional
structure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there
no
extremes?
is
there
no
limitation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
nevada.
the
respondent
filed
a
part
year
income
tax
return
in
california
in
which
he
claimed
he
had
left
california
and
become
a
nevada
resident
in
october
1991.
shortly
before
he
received
his
income,
some
substantial
licensing
fees,
the
petitioner,
california
tax
board
conducted
an
audit
and
determined
that
respondent
had
been
a
california
resident
until
april
1992.
as
a
result,
the
tax
board
issued
tax
assessments
and
imposed
substantial
civil
fraud
penalties.
the
respondent,
hyatt
filed
suit
against
the
franchise
tax
board
of
california
in
nevada
state
court
alleging
that
the
board
had
committed
negligence
and
intentional
torts
during
a
course
of
the
audit,
some
of
which
acts
were
alleged
have
been
done
in
nevada.
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
or
dismissal,
the
board
argued
that
the
nevada
court
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
required
nevada
courts
to
apply
a
california
statute
that
immunizes
the
state’s
tax
agency
from
suit.
when
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion,
the
petitioner
sought
writ
of
mandamus
from
the
nevada
supreme
court.
that
court
granted
the
petition
in
part
and
denied
it
in
part.
it
held
that
the
lower
court
should
have
declined
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
respondent’s
negligence
claim
under
principles
of
comity,
but
the
intentional
tort
claims
could
proceed
to
trial.
the
court
noted
that
nevada
immunizes
its
own
state
agencies
from
suits
for
discretionary
acts
but
not
for
intentional
torts.
that
court
accordingly
held
that
to
afford
petitioner’s
statutory
immunity
with
respect
to
intentional
torts
would
contravene
nevada’s
interest
in
protecting
its
citizens
from
bad
faith
acts
committed
by
sister
states'
government
employees.
we
hold
that
the
constitution’s
full
faith
and
credit
clause
does
not
require
nevada
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
california
statutes
providing
its
tax
agency
with
immunity
from
suit.
the
full
faith
and
credit
command
does
not
compel
a
state
to
substitute
the
statutes
of
other
states
for
its
own
statutes
dealing
with
a
subject
matter
concerning
which
it
is
competent
to
legislate.
nevada
is
undoubtedly
competent
to
legislate
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
alleged
intentional
torts
here
which
it
has
claimed
have
injured
one
of
its
citizens
within
its
borders.
we
declined
to
adopt
a
new
rule
requiring
state
courts
to
extend
full
faith
and
credit
to
a
sister
state’s
immunity
statutes
when
a
refusal
to
do
so
would
interfere
with
the
states'
capacity
to
fulfill
its
sovereign
responsibilities.
in
an
earlier
case,
nevada
versus
hall,
we
ruled
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
does
not
require
a
forum
state
to
apply
a
sister
state's
sovereign
immunity
statute
where
such
application
would
violate
the
forum
state’s
own
legitimate
public
policy
and
we
are
not
presented
here
with
a
case
in
which
the
forum
state
has
exhibited
a
policy
of
hostility
to
the
public
acts
of
sister
states.
the
nevada
supreme
court
sensitively
applied
comity
principles
with
a
healthy
regard
for
california’s
sovereign
status
relying
on
the
contours
of
nevada’s
own
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
as
a
benchmark
for
its
analysis.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
