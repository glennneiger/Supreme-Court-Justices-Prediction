chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
02-42,
franchise
tax
board
of
california
versus
gilbert
hyatt.
mr.
leatherwood.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
you
have
a
specific
act
of
congress
that
tells
the
federal
government
to
back
off.
and
i
don't
believe
you
have
any
such
thing
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
nevada
did
recognize
california
law
to
the
extent
it
was
similar
to
nevada's...
that
is,
saying
you
had
immunity
from
the
negligent
acts.
and
then
it
went
on
to
say,
no,
you
don't
have
immunity
from
intentional
acts,
even
though
california
law
does
give
immunity
from
intentional
acts.
but
surely
you
wouldn't
go
to
the
extreme
that
you
would
say
someone
could
come
over
to
las
vegas
from
california
and
just
beat
up
somebody
because
they
haven't
paid
their
taxes,
would
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
certainly
this
sort
of
thing
isn't
the
kind
of
thing
you
could
have
exhausted
your
remedies
on,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
that,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
is
a
difficult
thing
to
do,
because
there
are
congressional
statutes
that
mandate
that
here.
and
all
we
have
is
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
now,
perhaps
you
say
that's
sufficient,
but
isn't
it
possible
that
there
might
be
other
emanations
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
other
than
just
footnote
24,
or
whatever
it
is,
in
nevada
against
hall.
i'm
not
talking
about
overruling
it,
but
developing
it,
perhaps.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
would
have
to
show
as
an
intentional...
whatever
that
means
under
nevada
law...
not
just
negligent
when
they--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
want
to
reserve
your
time,
mr.
leatherwood?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
mr.
farr,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
our
original
jurisdiction
as
the
states
between
states
bear
something
on
this
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
idea
that
the
framers
would
provide
for
its
original
jurisdiction
in
the
supreme
court
in...
for
suits
by
one
state
against
another
suggests
they
thought
it
might
be
pretty
hard
to
bring
such
a
suit
anywhere
else.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
penal
laws
or
penal
judgments?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
can
you
say
that
categorically
and
absolutely?
i
mean,
there
are
all
sorts
of
permutations
of
facts
that
could
up.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
a
time
in
the
'30s
and
'20s
when
this
court
came
pretty
close
to
that,
the
cases
that
preceded
pacific
employers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
comity
is
something
like
a
hearty
handshake.
i
mean,
it...
it's
something
that
you
can't
put
any...
any
force
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
haven't--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
boundary
cases,
though,
adopted,
as
a
federal
rule,
something
maybe
different
from
the
law
of
either
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
farr.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
leatherwood.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-42,
franchise
tax
board
of
california
versus
hyatt
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
