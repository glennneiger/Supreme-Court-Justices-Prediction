anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
the
function
and
province
of
the
state
commission's
prudence
review?
what...
what
can
they
do
that's
proper?
and
i
assume
they
can
do
a
number
of
things
that
increase
costs
and
therefore
change
rates,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in...
in
the
course
of
that
regular
examination
that
they...
that
they
do,
can
they
find
certain
actions
that
require
refunds
to
the...
to
the
consumers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
never
if
it's
in
violation
of
a
tariff
or
a
ferc
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
except
that
ferc
specifically
addressed
this
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
and
your
earlier
answer
to
justice
breyer,
with
reference
to
whether
there
is
a
preemptive
effect
in
the,
what
we
might
call,
the
enforcement--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
interpretation
phase
of
the...
of
the
tariff,
it
seems
to
me
is
contrary
to
what
we
said
in
mississippi
power.
we...
we
actually
were
quoting
nantahala.
there
we
said
the
mississippi
supreme
court
erred
in
adopting
the
view
that
the
preemptive
effect
of
ferc
jurisdiction
turns
on
whether
a
particular
matter
was
actually
determined
in
ferc
proceedings.
