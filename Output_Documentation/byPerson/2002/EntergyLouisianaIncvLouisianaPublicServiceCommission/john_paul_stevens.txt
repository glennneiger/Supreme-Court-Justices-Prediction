well,
what's
left
of
public
service
commissions
then,
if...
if
you're
right,
so
far
as
policing
imprudent
acquisitions
and
that
sort
of
thing
for
a
multi...
multistate
company?
justice
john
paul
stevens
such
as.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
cost
of...
the
cost
of
power
is
just
one
of
the...
one
of
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
that...
is
that
a
death
sentence,
so
to
speak,
if
you
find
that
the
costs
are
trapped
and
unrecoverable?
may
not
that
ever
happen
to
a
utility
legitimately?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're...
you're
not
talking
about
costs...
trapped
costs
generally.
you're
just
talking
about
this
particular
kind
of
trapped
costs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
long
rejected
this
sort
of
case-by-case
analysis
of
the
impact
of
state
regulation
upon
the
national
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
it
was
violating
the
contract
in...
in
a
context
where
ferc
had...
had
looked
at
that...
that
specific
violation,
and
it...
and
it
announced
the
remedy.
