mr.
austin
c.
schlick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
nantahala
and
mississippi
power
&
light,
the
regulation
of
wholesale
rates
for
electric
energy
in
interstate
commerce
is
exclusively
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
federal
jurisdiction
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
multistate
utilities,
like
entergy
and
other
utilities,
are
able
to
carry
out
their
ferc-regulated
transactions,
to
plan
and
carry
out
those
transactions
without
the
interference
of
potentially
conflicting
state
regulation.
the
facts
of
this
case
highlight
the
need
for
exclusive
federal
regulation.
the
dispute
in
this
case
involves
the
correct
allocation
of
costs
incurred
for
the
common
benefit
of
five
utilities
in
four
different
states.
the
louisiana
commission
believed
that
the
costs
allocated
to
entergy
louisiana
were
too
high,
but
the
consequence
of
the
louisiana
commission's
rate
decision
would
be
to
reallocate
those
costs
to
ratepayers
in
texas,
arkansas,
and
mississippi
or
else
to
render
them
trapped
and
entirely
unrecoverable.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
correct,
your
honor.
under
this
court's
decision
in
nantahala,
a
charge
that
is
federally
approved
or
that
is
within
ferc's
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
approve
may
not
be
trapped
and
disallowed
by
the...
by
the
state
regulatory--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--that's
right.
i'm...
i'm
talking
about
costs
that
contribute
to
the
wholesale
rate
that...
that
is
within
ferc's
jurisdiction.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that
is...
i...
i
think
that...
that--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--there
are
two
points.
there...
there
is
the
general
prohibition
on
trapping,
but
also
in
this
case
we
have
a
ferc-approved
rate
schedule
that
determines
how
the
allocation
should
be
carried
out.
there's
a
question
whether
or
not
entergy
complied
with
that
rate
schedule,
but
the
resolution
of
that
question
involves
what
the
wholesale
rate
is
or
should
be,
and
that's
a
question
within
ferc's
jurisdiction.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
right.
only
ferc
can
decide
that
question.
unlike
the
cases
on
which
respondent
relies,
this
case
does
not
involve
a
state
contract
action
about
a
matter
that
is
within
the
state's
concurrent
jurisdiction.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
no
contract
dispute
between
the
parties
in
this
case,
the
entergy
operating
companies
and
the
holding
company.
rather,
this
case
arose
in
the
same
context
as
nantahala
and
mississippi
power
&
light,
a
retail
rate
setting.
and
the
dispute
involves
the
correct
division
among
the
operating
companies
in
multiple
states
of
costs
of
operating
the
system.
just
like
mississippi
power
&
light,
that's
a
cost...
that's
a...
a
question
that
only
the
ferc
can
determine.
it's
worth
mentioning
that--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--there...
there
is
a...
an
interpretation,
an
underlying
question
of
interpretation,
of
the
tariff,
but
beyond
that,
there's
the
question
of
whether
the
resulting
charge
was
just
and
reasonable.
and
that's
the
important
reasonableness
question.
that's
the
question
that
only
ferc
can
decide.
here
the
louisiana
commission
assumed
both
that
there
was
a
procedural
violation
of
the
system
agreement
in...
in
the
documentation
of
the
operating
committee's
decision--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--and
that
the
resulting
charge
was
unjust
and
unreasonable.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
in
the
context
of
what
the
wholesale
charge
is
or
should
be,
the
provision
of
the
act
is
section
824d
and...
and
824e.
the
underlying
principle
was
established
by
this
court's
decision
in
attleboro,
which
is
that
states
are
entirely
disabled
from
regulating
wholesale
rates.
that
was
implemented
through
the
federal
power
act
in
1935.
it
was
confirmed
in
this
court's
decision--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--justice
scalia,
in
fact,
they
were
regulating
the
wholesale
charge.
the
necessary
determination
of
the
louisiana
commission's
order
was
that
the
costs
pass
through
under
the
federal
rate
schedule
to
entergy
louisiana.
the
specific
costs
allocated
on
the
rate
schedule
were
too
high.
it
was
imprudent
in
the
louisiana
commission's
judgment
for
entergy
louisiana--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--that...
that's
correct.
the--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--the
only
additional
step
that
need
be
taken
in
this...
in
this
case
is
to
determine
whether
the
fact
that
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
the
ferc
rate
schedule
was
violated
somehow
puts
the
case
within
the
state's
jurisdiction.
that
was
the
question
that
only
ferc
can
answer.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
we
believe
it's
precisely
the
same.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
our...
our
answer
to
that
question
is
there
is
no
difference.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
not
just
as
an
intervenor.
under
section
825e
of
the
act,
the
state
could
actually
bring
a
complaint--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--to
ferc.
it
could
bring
the
issue
directly
to
ferc.
and--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--the
order
415
proceeding
in
1997...
that
was
resolved
in
1997...
shows
exactly
how
this
should
happen.
the--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--oh,
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
justice
scalia,
the
order
415
proceeding
shows
precisely
the
problem
with
that.
in
that
case,
ferc
said
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
system
agreement,
analogous
to
the
one
that's
being
claimed
here.
but
it
also
said
that
the
resulting
charge
was
just
and
reasonable.
in
fact,
ratepayers
benefited
overall
from
what
was
done
by
entergy.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
well,
the...
the
rate
schedule
has
been
approved--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--by
ferc
and--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--there's
a
requirement--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--and
there's
a
requirement
to
the
comply
with
rate
schedule.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
right.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
right.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
justice
scalia,
what...
what
happens
is
then
the
question
becomes
was
the
resulting
charge
just
and
reasonable.
in
order
415,
ferc
determined
the
resulting
charge
after
a
violation
of
the
rate
schedule
was
just
and
reasonable.
in
fact,
ratepayers
in
louisiana
benefited
from
what
entergy
did,
notwithstanding
that
it
wasn't
in
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
rate
schedule
at
that
time.
