unknown
speaker
--that
was
so
clear
to
the
parties
at
the
time,
and
you
say
it
is
and...
and
what
they...
what
they
were
anticipating
is
a
change
in
the
federal--
unknown
speaker
--and
therefore
you
should
do
what
you
would
have
done
if
they
had
complained.
unknown
speaker
--well,
let
counsel
answer.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
said.
unknown
speaker
and
in
this
case,
you're
saying...
so
that...
so
that
the...
ferc
is
not
saying
what
the
number
is
in
advance.
it's
setting
the
process
in
advance.
unknown
speaker
and
what
you're
saying
is,
sure,
they
came
up
with
the
number,
ostensibly
what
ferc
told
them
they
could
do,
but
they
didn't
go
through
the
right
process
to
get
it,
and
therefore
the
number
is
no
good.
but
in
order
to
say
the
number
is
no
good,
you're
still
challenging
something
which,
at
least
on
its
face,
has
been
authorized
by
ferc.
and
therefore,
why
isn't
the
appropriate
action
for
you
to
take,
to
go
back
to
ferc
and
say,
the
number
they're
claiming
under
your
authority
is
the
wrong
number,
tell
them
it's
the
wrong
number?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
the
question
here.
that's
the
question
here.
unknown
speaker
do
they
have
it
or
is
it
preempted?
unknown
speaker
and
one
question
as
to
whether
it's
preempted,
i
would
think,
would
be
can
they
go
back
to
the
federal
ratemaker
and...
and,
in
fact,
get
the
relief
that
they
want.
that's
something
we
ought
to
consider.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
they--
--okay.
you're
talking
about
the
condition
today,
and
what
you're
saying
today
is,
whenever
ferc
sets
a
tariff
that
leaves
the
bottom
line
number
to
be
filled
in
later,
a
state
utility
commission
in
a
ratemaking
proceeding
may
challenge
that
bottom
line
number
in
its
own
bailiwick.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
doing.
unknown
speaker
all
that
you're
saying
is
that
justice
souter
was
wrong
to
limit
it
to
places
where
the
federal
tariff
is
open.
it's
just
as
applicable
to
instances
where
the
federal
tariff
is
specific.
and
you're
saying
that
congress
in
the
federal
power
act
set
up
an
act
where
you
have
a
single
central
federal
body
to
provide
tariffs
for,
let's
say,
the
billions
and
billions
of
kilowatt
hours
made
every
year,
but
that
each
state...
50
or
51
different
local
service
commissions
are
going
to
adjudicate
whether
or
not
those
millions
of
words
are,
in
fact,
violated
and
what
we
will
have
is
51
separate
decisionmaking
bodies
to
determine
when
a
ferc
tariff
has
been
violated.
now,
i
grant
you
congress
did
not
say
in
the
act,
and
we
don't
mean
to
do
that.
but
it
would
be
an
awfully
surprising
thing
for
them
to
want
to
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
said
they
don't
want
to
do
it,
then
why
are
you
arguing
to
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
don't
want
to
do
that
is...
means
that
they
don't
want
51
bodies--
unknown
speaker
--adjudicating
the
correctness
of
the
application
of
rules
for
wholesale
rates
that
are
contained
of
thousands
or
millions
of
words
filed
before
the
federal
power
commission.
unknown
speaker
i've
always
thought
that
the
federal
power
act
did
not
want
to
have
51
adjudicative
bodies,
but
rather
wanted
to
have
one
centralized
body
that
states
were
free
to
use.
unknown
speaker
no,
okay.
unknown
speaker
mr.
fontham...
mr.
fontham,
there
are
five
states
in
this
and
there
could
be
more
in
a
regional
organization.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
[=
10]
o'clock.
