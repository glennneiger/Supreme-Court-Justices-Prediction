mr.
david
w.
carpenter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
multistate
power
systems,
each
retail
rake...
ratemaking
body
has
incentives
to
impose
cost
allocations
that
benefit
its
residents,
and
the
only
way
to
assure
that
the
power
pool
recovers
a
hundred
percent
of
its
generating
costs
is
for
a
neutral
body
to
referee
disputes
among
the
states
and
to
fix
the
allocations.
this
case
arises
in
the
energy
system
where
five
subsidiaries
provide
retail
service
in
four
different
states,
where
ferc
has
found
that
entergy's
cost
allocations
generally
can't
affect
its
net
revenues
and
where
ferc
has
thus
approved
a
tariff
that
gives
entergy
authority
to
calculate
the
inter-company
equalization
payments
that
allocate
costs
with
a
ferc
complaint
as
the
sole
remedy
if
the
rates
and
allocations
are
believed
to
be
unlawful.
though
we--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--it's
the
sole
remedy
under
the
tariff
itself,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
under
the
tariff
itself,
the
only
right
that
is
reserved
to
the...
this
is
section
4.12,
joint
appendix
11a.
the
only
right
that
is
reserved
to
the
operating
companies
is
to
seek
amend...
if
there's
a
dispute
over
the
rates,
is
to
seek
amendments
in
the
tariff
or
changes
in
the
rate
from
the
regulatory
body
that
has
jurisdiction.
there's
no
question
here
that
the
lpsc
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
to
order
amendments
to
the
service
schedule
or
changes
in
the
rates.
their
claim
is
only
that
they
can
disallow
the
costs
that
were
incurred.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes,
it
would
preclude
a
judicial
remedy.
it
operates
as
a...
as
a...
as,
obviously,
a
limitation
on
the
operating
companies'
remedies
and
as
a
forum
selection
clause
in
the
event
of
a
dispute.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
i--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--yes.
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i...
i
meant
that
they
can't
go...
they
couldn't
go
straight
to
court,
and
it
means
that...
for
the
same
reason
that
a
state
retail
ratemaking
body
can't
disallow
the
costs
because
under...
under
this
rate
schedule,
the
rate
calculated
by
the
energy
system
is
the
filed
rate
and
binds
everybody
unless
and
until
a
complaint
is
filed
with
ferc
and
ferc
holds
otherwise.
and
in
fact,
the
louisiana
commission
here
brought
a
complaint
for
the
period
ending
in
august
of
1997,
and
ferc
denied
relief
on
the
ground
that
although
the
tariff
didn't
authorize
it,
it
was
just
and...
nonetheless
just
and
reasonable
for
entergy
to
calculate
equalization
payments
by
including
certain
units
that
were
in
extended
reserve
status
because
ferc
found
that
those
units
benefited
louisiana
and
the
entire
system.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
well,
at
the
time
this--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--well,
it
was...
it
was
fairly
prescient
because
this...
this
language
i
think
dates
from
1953,
when
there
was
the
federal
power
commission.
so,
it--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--but
the...
the
key
thing
here
is
that
it's
undisputed
that
the
lpsc
can't
amend
the
service
agreement.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
right.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
but...
but
in
the
aftermath
of
the
ferc
order
that
found
that
these
charges
were
just
and
reasonable,
despite
a
finding
of
the
tariff
violation,
the
louisiana
commission
entered
an
order
that
said
that
ferc's
determination
bound
it
only
for
the
precise
period
that
ferc
had
addressed,
and
then
entered
an
order
that
prohibited
the
petitioner,
entergy
louisiana,
eli,
from
recovering
the
same
wholesale
costs
in
retail
rates
for
the
immediately
succeeding
period,
beginning
august
5th,
1977.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that
became
the
period
because
that
was
the
date
of
the
ferc
order.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
that
was
the...
that
was
the...
the
theory--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--of
louisiana
public
service
commission.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
oh,
no.
no
question
at
all.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's
right.
here
the
filed
rate
is
a
formula
that
is--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--that's
right.
it
can
change...
it
can
change
i
believe
monthly,
or
the...
the
rate
calculated
under
the
formula
can
change
monthly.
and...
and
ferc
approves
formula
rates,
you
know,
in
circumstances
where
it
believes
that
it
will
better
promote
the
overall
goals
of...
of
the
act,
and
it
imposes
terms
and
conditions
that
will
assure
that
the
overall
goals
of
the
act
are
promoted.
and
here
a
critical
term
and
condition
was
that
the
determinations
of
the
amount
of
the
payments
is
centralized
at
ferc
and
the
only
remedy,
if
there's
a
disagreement,
is
to
go
to
ferc
and
file
a
complaint.
as
i
point
out,
that's
clear
from
the
terms
of
the
tariff,
and
that's
what
ferc
said
in
each
of
the
orders
in
which
it
authorized
the
formula
rates.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
but
the...
if
ferc
were
to
agree
with
the
public
service
commission
that
we
violated
the
tariff,
that
the
result
was
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
a
refund
was
appropriate,
all
the
interests
would
be
protected
because
the...
they
would
order
a
refund
at
the
wholesale
level
with
interest
that
the
louisiana
public
service
commission
could
flow
through
to
retail
rate
papers...
rate
payers.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
well,
they
have
standing
under
the
act
itself.
section
305
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
no.
but...
but
they...
but...
but
what
it
does
mean
is
that
they
cannot
premise
a...
a
prudence
disallowance
on
the
ground
that...
that
eli
could
have
refused
to
pay
the
costs
or...
or
required
that
the
equalization
payments
be
calculated
on
a
different
basis.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
but...
but...
sure,
they
could
say
that.
it
was
imprudent
not
to
go
to
ferc.
but
they
can't
speculate
about
what
ferc
would
do
in
the
event
a
complaint
was
filed.
that's
clear
from
the
arkansas
louisiana
gas
case
of
this
court.
so
while
it's
theoretically
possible
they
could
say
that
it
was
imprudent
not
to
go
to
ferc,
no
remedy
could
be
predicated
on
that
finding
of
imprudence
because
they
can't
speculate
about
what
ferc
would
do
if
a
complaint
were
filed.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
absolutely,
absolutely.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
absolutely.
they
can
do
that.
and
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
to
justice
ginsburg
is
it...
when
that
procedure
is
followed,
all
legitimate
interests
are
protected
because
if
ferc
agrees
and
orders
a
refund,
it
will
be...
it
can
then
be
flowed
through
by
the
louisiana
commission
to
the
retail
ratepayers.
conversely,
under
their
procedure
in
which
they
can
disallow
costs
pending
a
ferc
determination
on
the
precise...
on
the
precise
issue,
you
have
exactly
the...
the
interference
with
commerce
that
the
federal
power
act
was
designed
to
prevent.
you've
got
duplicative
litigation
of
this
issue.
here
in...
could
be
in
five
different
retail
ratemaking
bodies.
and
the
effect
can
be
a
trapping
of
costs
that
we
never
get
back
because
if
ferc...
you
know,
they...
they
trap
the
costs
pending
the
ferc
order.
ferc
then
says...
reviews
it
and
says
what
we
did
was
fine,
just
and
reasonable.
then
obviously
ferc
doesn't
do
anything
at
the
wholesale
level.
in
the
meantime,
our
costs
have
been
trapped
at
the
retail
level,
and
we
can't
get
the
money
back
under
the
general
rule
barring
retroactive
ratemaking
unless
an
exception
were
somehow
made
to
that
rule.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
well,
what
they...
what
they
can
do
is
they
can
regulate
the...
the
prudence
of...
of
decisions
that
the...
the
utility
had
to
make.
so
in
circumstances
where
a
ferc
tariff
provides
a
choice
to
the...
to
the
retail
utility,
which
was
the
situation
in
the
pike
county
case,
then...
then
the...
the
state
commission
can
find
that
it
was
imprudent
to
exercise
the
choice
in
one
fashion
or
another.
but
the
point
here
is
there
was
no
choice.
the
equalization
payment
bound
the...
bound
eli
unless
and
until
it
was
found
to
be
unlawful
by...
by
ferc.
so
this
is
a
situation
where
under
the
filed
rate
doctrine
and
under
this
court's
decisions
in
mp&l
and
nantahala,
the...
the
state
commission
was
required
to
treat
the
resulting
expense
as
a
retail...
as
a
just
and
reasonable
expense
and
pass
it
through
to
retail
ratepayers
unless
and
until
ferc
ordered
otherwise.
there's
obviously
a
range
of
other
issues
that
aren't...
aren't
governed
by
ferc
rate
schedules
at
all,
as
to
which
state
utility
commissions
can
examine
the
reasonableness
of
the
decisions
of
the...
of
the
retail
body.
but
they
can't
say
that...
that
following
your
duties
under
a
ferc
tariff
is
unjust
and
unreasonable.
that's
a
question
for
ferc.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
absolutely,
your
honor.
they
can
disallow...
they
disallow
charitable
expenses.
they
disallow
expenses
all
the
time.
there's
a
citation--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--right.
they
cannot,
consistent
with
the
federal
power
act,
say
that
it
was
imprudent
to
do...
to...
to
do
what
the
ferc
tariff
required
the
utility
to
do.
that's
the
clear
teaching
of
mp&l
and
nantahala
and...
and
other
decisions.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
in
the
context
of
the
retail
ratemaking
proceeding?
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
no,
your
honor.
that's
an
issue
exclusively
for
ferc
because,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
if
the
rate
is
believed
to
be
too
high,
under
the
tariff,
the...
the
only
remedy
the
operating
company
would
have
would
be
to
go
to
ferc
and...
and
complain,
and
the
operating
company
has...
has
no...
no
right
to
refuse
to
make
a
payment
on
the
ground
that
there's
an
allegation
that
the
equalization
formula
was
improperly
implied.
but
as
i...
as
i
just
said,
the
filed
rate
doctrine
clearly,
you
know,
prohibited
the
order
here,
and
even
if
it
didn't
apply,
this
is
an
issue
that...
the
issue
of
the...
the
reasonableness
of
rates
and
the
practices
affecting
rates
is
an
issue
that
the
federal
power
act
clearly
allocates
to
ferc.
so
even
if
the
tariff
here
didn't,
you
know,
clearly
preclude
eli
from
doing
what
the
lpsc
found
a
prudent
company
would
have
done,
the...
the
filed...
the
federal
power
act
preempted
the...
the
state
from
addressing
the
issue.
and
the
facts
of
this
case
sort
of
illustrate
why
states
shouldn't
get
involved
in...
in
this
because
the
decision
that
was
made
here
sort
of
exemplifies
the
parochialism
that
the
commerce
clause
and
the
federal
power
act
was
designed
to
prevent.
it
was
acknowledged
by
the
louisiana
public
service
commission
that
the...
the
units
in
question,
the
out-of-state
units
in
question,
benefited
louisiana
and
the
entire
system,
increased
the
efficiency
of
the
entire
system.
but
it
said
that
was
irrelevant.
in
fact,
it
said
that
was
evidence
of
imprudence
because
the
effect
was
to
increase
the
costs
that
eli
incurred
and
thus
to
increase
retail
rates,
and
that's
a...
the
kind
of
parochialism
that
the
commerce
clause
prevents
and
the
federal
power
act
was
designed
to
draw
a
bright
line
that
would
eliminate
any
need
to
even
adjudicate
questions
whether
the
conduct
violates
the
federal--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--well,
they...
they
can't
regulate
issues
involving,
you
know,
the
exchanges
of
power
within
power
pools,
but
there
are
a
range
of
other
issues
that,
as
i
said
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
that
the
states
can...
can
decide.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
well,
the...
you
know,
whether...
whether
expenses
not
dictated
by
a
ferc...
ferc
rate
schedule
are
just
and
reasonable.
there's
a
whole
range
of
other
expenses
that--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--yes,
just
one
of
the
expenses
that
a
retail
utility
would
incur.
and...
and
so
there's
a
range
of
issues
that
they
can
decide.
what
they
can't
do,
though,
is...
is
decide
that
it
was
imprudent
to
incur
a
cost
that
a
ferc
rate
schedule
required
the
utility
to
incur,
and
that's
the
issue
here.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
well...
well,
ferc
regulates
the
transactions
within
power
pools--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--yes,
but
ferc's
jurisdiction
depends
on
the
fact
that...
jurisdiction
depends
on
the
existence
of
wholesale
sales
which...
which
exist
in
the
context
of
a
power
pool
because
each
retail
utility
is
simultaneously,
you
know,
providing
power
to
the
pool
at
the
set
rate.
so
it's--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--absolutely,
your
honor.
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's
right.
if
it
were...
if
it
were
subject
to
the
identical
rate
schedule.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
else
i
need
to
add.
