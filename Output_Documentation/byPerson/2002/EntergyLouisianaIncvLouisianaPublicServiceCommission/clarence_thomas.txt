justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiania.
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
(ferc)
regulates
the
sale
of
electricity
at
wholesale
and
interstate
commerce.
under
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
ferc
approved
cost
allocations
between
affiliated
energy
companies
may
not
be
reevaluated
by
state
regulators
in
setting
retail
rates.
petitioner,
entergy
louisiana,
inc.
or
eli
is
one
of
the
five
public
utilities
owned
by
entergy
corporation.
eli
shares
capacity
with
its
corporate
siblings
in
other
states
and
this
allows
each
company
to
access
additional
capacity
when
necessary.
entergy
allocates
cost
for
the
sharing
through
a
tariff
approved
by
ferc
called
the
system
agreement.
under
the
agreement,
some
companies
like
eli,
make
payments
to
others
to
cover
capacity
cost.
in
the
1980's
the
operating
committe
which
administers
the
system
agreement
initiated
the
extended
reserve
shutdown
or
ers
program.
the
ers
program
responded
to
systemwide
overcapacity
by
allowing
some
generating
units
not
immediately
necessary
for
capacity
needs
to
be
effectively
mothballed.
because
ers
units
could
be
reactivated
if
needed,
they
were
considered
available
for
purposes
of
calculating
capacity
cost
payment.
in
august
of
1997,
ferc
found
that
entergy
had
violated
the
system
agreement
in
classifying
ers
units
as
available
but
determined
that
a
refund
was
not
due
eli
customers.
ferc
approved
an
amendment
to
the
system
agreement
allowing
ers
unit
to
be
treated
as
available
if
the
operating
committee
determines
that
it
intends
to
return
the
unit
to
service
at
a
future
day.
in
1997,
eli
made
its
annual
retail
rate
filing
with
respondent,
louisiana
public
service
commission.
one
of
the
contested
issues
in
this
proceeding
was
whether
the
cost
of
ers
units
should
be
considered
in
setting
eli's
retail
rates.
in
finding
its
review
to
the
period
after
the
ferc
order
had
issued,
the
commission
concluded
that
it
was
not
preempted
from
disallowing
eli's
payments
or
capacity,
and
eli
was
not
permitted
to
charge
retail
rates
that
reflected
the
cost
of
these
payments.
the
state
district
court
denied
eli's
petition
for
review
and
the
state
supreme
court
upheld
the
commission's
decision.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
under
our
decisions
and
nantahala
power
&
light
company
versus
thornburg
and
mississippi
power
&
light
company
versus
mississippi
ex
rel.
moore,
the
commission's
order
is
preempted
through
the
filed
rate
doctrine.
in
both
of
these
cases,
we
held
that
ferc
approved
cost
allocations
could
not
be
second
guess
by
state
regulators.
the
only
differnce
between
the
tariffs
in
nantahala
and
mp&l
and
the
tariff
in
this
case
is
that
this
one
grants
the
regulated
holding
company
discretion
to
set
the
precise
allocation.
we
do
not
find
the
distinction
significant
enough
to
save
the
commission's
order
from
preemption.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
