justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
would
be
a
judicial
remedy
if
they
disagreed
with
the...
with...
with
ferc's
determination.
they
could...
they
could
appeal
to
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
just
couldn't
go
straight
to
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait,
wait.
how
would...
how
would
the
louisiana
public
service
commission
have
standing
to
come
to
ferc?
i
mean,
to
come
back
to
the
agreement,
it
says
each
company...
the
companies
who
are
parties
to
the
agreement...
reserves
the
right
to
unilaterally
seek
amendments
or
changes.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
provision
doesn't
govern
what
they
can
seek
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
sure,
they
can.
they
could
say
the
company
was
at
fault
for
not
going
to
ferc.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
can
they
go
to
ferc
as
an
intervenor?
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
take
it
that
was
their
status.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
could
go
in
and
say,
look,
they
should
have
complained--
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
what
louisiana
is
saying,
they...
they're
conceding
that
ferc
has
the
authority,
the
exclusive
authority,
to
prescribe
what
the
division
would
be.
however,
they're
saying
if,
in
fact,
there's
a
violation
of
that
division,
the
states
ought
to
be
able
to
adjudicate
the
violation.
they're
still
giving
ferc
all
of...
all
of
its
power.
they're
saying
ferc
decides
what
the
division
will
be,
but
the
state
agency
can
determine
that
the
division
has
not
been
carried
out
the
way
ferc
prescribed.
what
is
there
in
the
act
that...
that
says
that
ferc
is
the
exclusive
adjudicator
of
whether
its
directives
have
been
complied
with?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
regulating
the
wholesale
rates
is
what...
is
the
argument
that
will
be
made
by
the
state.
they're...
they're
leaving
it
to
ferc
to
regulate
it,
but
they're
adjudicating
whether
the
rates
prescribed
by...
by
ferc
have,
in
fact,
been
the
rates
charged.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
court
said
in
mississippi
power
&
light
that
once
ferc
sets
a
wholesale
rate,
a
state
may
not
conclude
in
setting
retail
rates
that
the
ferc-approved
wholesale
rates
are
unreasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
guess
that's
the
law,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
seems
to
me
it's
quite
a
different
question.
question
one
is
whether
the
allocation
was
unreasonable,
and
the
state
here
is
saying
we're...
we're
not
questioning
the
reasonableness
of
the
allocation.
that's
up
to
ferc.
but
we
don't
think
that
we
were
charged
that
allocation
that...
that
was
given
to
us.
and
that's...
that's
not
challenging
ferc's
decision
of
what
the
allocation
should
be.
it's
challenging
the
factual
question
of
whether
the
allocation
was
carried
out
the
way
ferc
prescribed.
justice
antonin
scalia
must
be
a
section
of
the
ferc
rules
or
regs
or
tariffs
which
says
the
company
may...
must...
or
must
pass
over
to
the
company
that
has
the
higher
number
of
generators
a
charge
equal
to
the
amount,
da,
da,
da,
that
this
particular
thing
we
have
before
it
gives
the
allocation
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
says
that
in
the
rate
schedule.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
rate
schedule
of
ferc
says
charge
a
rate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--based
on
this
allocation.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
i'll
ask
the
other
side.
i
don't
see
any
room
for
the
question
that
was
just
raised.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
do.
i
mean,
what...
what
happens
if
the...
the
state
says,
they
haven't
charged
it
according
to
that
allocation?
then
mississippi--
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
think
that's
right
under
the
law,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
because?
justice
antonin
scalia
because?
okay,
that's
exactly--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
to
get
the
question
very
precise,
that
is
the
question.
in
mp&l,
it
said
once
ferc
sets
a
rate,
which
means,
i
take
it,
that
they
have
the
terms
that
we've
just
described
in
the
tariffs,
a
state
may
not
conclude
in
setting
retail
rates
that
the
ferc-approved
rates
are
unreasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
now,
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
what
you
just
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
--maybe...
maybe
it
can
if
ferc
has
not
previously
adjudicated
that
very
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
here
what...
what
they're
contending
is
that
ferc
not
only
prescribed
the
formula,
but
that
in
order
415,
it
adjudicated
that
the
formula
had
been
properly
applied
or,
if
improperly
applied,
close
enough
for
government
work
is
what
they
said.
and
once
they
decided
that,
their
contention
is,
it's
not
up
to
the
state
to
second-guess
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
wait.
can
you
please
go
back
and
explain
to
me
my
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
use
your
example--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
have,
i
mean,
it
sounds
to
me
that
what
you're
saying
is
a
revolution
in
rate
conditions
or
setting
in
the
united
states.
i've
always
understood
it
to
be,
because
of
the
sentence
of
mpl
that
i
read
to
you,
that
if
ferc
says
we
have
a
piece
of
paper
here
that
either
directly
or
through
a
formula
makes
clear
that
$5
of
your
cost,
your
total
cost
for
the
consumer,
is
correct
way
to
determine
an
interstate
part
of
it,
then
when
the
local
commission
looks
at
the
$10
rate
to
the
consumer,
it
can
do
what
it
wants,
but
it
has
to
take
that
$5
as
a
given.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
the
commission
thinks
that
the
$5
that
the
company
put
on
its
line
as
part
of
the
interstate
payment
did
not
comply
with
every
condition,
did
not
satisfy
the
law
because
it
was
unjust
and
unreasonable,
their
remedy
is
to
go
to
ferc
and
to
say,
ferc,
they
didn't
comply
with
your
conditions.
they
let...
got
an
unreasonable
rate.
that
the
commission's
remedy...
the
local
commission...
is
not
to
readjudicate
that
itself.
and
the...
the
legal
authority
for
what
i've
just
said
i've
always
thought
was
the
sentence
i
read
to
you
out
of
mp&l.
now,
where
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
extra
5.
now,
i
thought
what
we
were
dealing
with
here
was
a
formula
set
out
by
what
i
used
to
call
the
fpc,
which...
which
formula
said
that
the
5
is
made
up
of
many
things.
one
of
those
things
is
a
charge
that
the
louisiana
company
is
to
pay
to
a
company
in
a
different
state
to
reflect
the
fact
that
that
company
in
the
different
state
has
generators
in
reserve
capacity
that
serve
everybody,
and
among
those
generators
are
generators
that
were
put
in
mothballs
provided
that
they
noted
in
the
minutes
of
the
joint
company,
et
cetera
that
this
is
a
mothballed
generator
available
for
reserve
capacity
if
necessary.
all
right,
and
if
i
understand
it
correctly
and
i've
said
it
correctly,
then
the
cost
at
issue
here
is
part
of
the
5,
not
part
of
the
other
5.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
now
we're
repeating
because
i...
i
just
said
that
if
you
think
that
the
minutes
were
not
filled,
if
you
think
one
of
the
other
conditions
that
was
put
forth
in
that
particular
tariff,
which
i
guess
is...
what
is...
page
57
or
something
of
the...
of...
but
if
you
think
one
of
those
was
not
fulfilled,
then
your
remedy
is
to
go
to
the
fpc...
the
ferc
rather.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
beginning
to
understand
your
argument.
is
this
what
it
is?
that
you'd...
imagine
we
have
a
federal
ferc
rule,
and
it
says
you
can
include
in
your...
in
your
charge
to
the
wholesale
company
the
charge
of
sending
a
salesman
to
the
foreign
state
to
tell
him
about
your
product.
all
right?
and
now
we
have...
now
we
have...
you
go
before
the
state
commission
and
the
company
says,
and
it
costs
me
$117
to
send
mr.
smith
to
do
that.
and
you
want
to
say,
i,
of
course,
am
forbidden
from
arguing
to
you,
the
state
commission,
that
they
violated
the
tariff.
but
i
can
tell
you
that
this
salesman,
named
murphy,
actually
spent
most
of
his
time
in
a
chicken
restaurant,
and
therefore,
what
he
did
for
that
117
fell
outside
the
tariff.
it
didn't
violate
the
tariff.
it
fell
outside
the
tariff.
and
similarly,
you
want
to
say
here
that
the
cost
of
the
generator
in
mothballs
did
not
violate
the
tariff
to
include
it,
but
rather
fell
outside
the
tariff
because
they
never
had
the
minutes,
et
cetera.
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what's
both?
if
you
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
say
you're
arguing
it
violated
the
tariff,
you
have
an
additional
problem
which
is
that
the
louisiana
public
service
commission
itself
said
that
the
staff
wants
us
to
say
this
violated
the
ferc
tariff,
but
we
have
no
power
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
and
they're
talking
about
the
post-august
5th,
aren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
then
they
say,
lpsc
staff
argues
that
the
ms-1
overpayment
should
be
disallowed
because
the
decision
violated
the
ferc
tariff.
as
eli
argues,
this
commission
is
preempted
from
determining
whether
the
terms
of
a
ferc
tariff
have
been
met,
for
the
issue
of
violation
or
compliance
with
a
ferc
tariff
is
peculiarly
within
ferc's
purview.
any
allegation
of
a
violation
of
a
ferc
tariff
should,
therefore,
be
brought
before
ferc.
i
read
that
and
thought
they
seem
not
to
have
decided
this
on
the
basis
that
you've
been
arguing
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
it's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law?
it's
wrong
at
describing
what
they
thought?
