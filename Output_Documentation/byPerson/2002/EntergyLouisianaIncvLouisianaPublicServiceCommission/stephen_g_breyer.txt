justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask?
the...
the
section
of
the...
of
the
agreement
that
you...
you
referred
us
to,
4.12.
it
says
each
company
reserves
the
right
to
unilaterally
seek
amendments
or
changes
from
any
regulatory
body
having
or
acquiring
jurisdiction
thereover.
why
didn't
they
just
say
from
ferc?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
if
as
you
say
it's
only
ferc,
why
didn't
they
just
say
from
ferc?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
see.
i
see.
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
got
you.
no.
i
was
just
wondering
whether--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--body
that
had
jurisdiction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
how
is
that
different
from
the
state
determining
that
a
retail
rate
is
unreasonable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
there
is
nothing
extra.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
have
to
see
what
the
other
side
would
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
a
response
to
this,
though,
because
you
said
before...
and
this
very
interesting
argument
might
be
cut
short
if
the
paragraph
that
i
read
to
you
is
applied
to
the
19...
post-1965
costs,
which
i...
aren't
they
the
costs
that
were
at
issue
when...
when
the
staff
was
talking
about
disallowing
costs?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
post...
the...
there's
the
post-'65
or...
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but...
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes,
that's
right.
i
understand
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
are...
but
it's...
it's
the
'97
costs
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
when
they're
talking
about
this,
it
seemed
as
if
they're
talking
about
post-august
5th,
1997
costs
on
page
64a,
65a.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
sure
they're
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
but
you
know
what
i'm
thinking
of
on
page
64a
and
65a
of
your
appendix.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
your
reference
to
the
new
tariff.
i
thought
the--
--it's...
it's...
they
have
a...
b,
is
this
committee
precluded
from
determining
whether
the
operating
committee's
decision
was
in
compliance
with
the
amended
section
10.02
of
the
system
agreement?
