mr.
michael
r.
fontham
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
following.
the
ferc
approved
a
contract
amendment
that
established
conditions,
procedures
before
a
utility
could
bill
an
affiliate
for
units
in
mothballs.
the
utility
failed
to
follow
the
procedures,
failed
to
consider
the
conditions,
and
failed
to
record
the
decision
in
its
minutes,
as
it
was
required
to
do,
and
then
said
to
the
lpsc--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--thank
you,
your
honor.
and
then
said
to
the
lpsc,
you
must
take
the
charges
anyway.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
because
the
issue
in
this
case
is
a
drastic
departure
from
what
this
court
held
in
mp&l
or
in
nantahala.
in
that--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--in
those
cases--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
the...
the
difference
is
that
the
ferc
set
the
rate.
the
utility
couldn't
bill
for
the
units
because
it
hadn't
gone
through
the
procedure
under
the
ferc
rate.
the
utility
billed
anyway.
it
says
if
the
rate
said
5,
the
utility
sends
a
bill
for
10.
10
shows
up
in
the
retail
rate
case.
the
question
is,
can
the
state
agency,
looking
at
the
ferc
tariff
and
looking
at
what
the
utility
billed,
make
the
decision,
instead
of
the
utility
making
the
decision,
in
the
state
proceeding
that
it's
wrong.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
and
it
hasn't.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
your
honor,
i
don't...
that
may
be
what
they're
saying,
but
that's
not
what
happened
in
the
case.
the...
in
the
case
the
ferc
did
refuse
to
order
refunds.
it
held
that
the
utility
had
invalidly
exercised
its,
quote/unquote,
discretion
to
violate
a
clear
and
ambiguous
tariff
for
10
years.
then
it
said,
we're
going
to
have
a
new
tariff.
we're
going
to
curb
the
utilities'
discretion.
we're
going
to
require
the
utility
to
have
a
procedure.
we
were
saying
it
is
too...
it
was
too
vague,
but
no,
no.
the
utilities
said,
our
discretion
will
be
curbed.
the
ferc
said,
their
discretion
will
be
curbed.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit
said
their
discretion
will
be
curbed.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
the
ferc
said
that
looking
retroactively,
in
effect,
retroactively--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
because
the
costs
that
were
incurred
and
are
at
issue
here...
actually,
i
lost
that
issue
before
the
lpsc.
the
lpsc,
as
to
all
the
charges
up
until
august
1997,
said
since
the
ferc
retroactively
effectively
changed
the
filed
rate...
i
don't
know
how
they
can
do
that,
but
they
did...
they
retroactively
approved
a
new
filed
rate.
you...
we
can't
touch
that.
then
the
lpsc
said,
okay,
now
we've
got
a
new
contract
amendment
that
operates
prospectively.
and
what
does
it
require?
take
a
look
at
what
it
requires.
this
was
in...
litigated
issue.
and
the
lpsc
says,
well,
they
didn't
follow
the
conditions
again.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
we
did
that.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
you
are
wrong,
your
honor,
in
this.
mp&l
says
that
the
state
commission
has
to
take
the
5.
if
the
tariff
says
5,
it
has
to
take
the
5.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
we're
dealing
with
the
extra
5
here.
we're
dealing
with
the
overcharge,
the
overbilling,
the
violation
of
the
contract.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
i'll
give
you
that,
your
honor.
the...
but
the...
but
the
problem
and
the
difference
is
that...
there
was
a
little
more
in
the
tariff
condition.
it
said
you
have
to
have
a
plan
to
return
the
unit
to
service.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
did
they
have
that?
no.
it
said--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--and
then...
and
that
poses
the
question
beautifully
because
we're
in
a
state
ratemaking
proceeding
and
now
we
know
the
question.
does
the
state
get
to
interpret
the
tariff
and
decide
what
it
means
and
what
it
says,
or
does
the
utility?
because
the
ferc
is
not
here
to
tell
us.
so
the
question
is,
what
goes
into
rates
today?
the
utility's
decision
based
on
a
violation
of
the
tariff
which
was
litigated
through
the
louisiana
courts?
they
got
to
eat
the
cake,
but
now
they're
back
because
they
didn't
like
the
taste
of
the
cake,
to
put
it--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
what...
what
the
commission
says
is
that
eli
is
at
fault
in
the
sense
of
any
utility,
going
back
to...
to
justice
souter's
reference
to
two
independent
companies
in
a
wholesale
power
transaction.
now,
we
all
know
you
can
go
to
court
to
enforce
a
wholesale
tariff,
and
that's
where
most
people
go.
in
the
case
of
a
parent-subsidiary
relationship,
well,
obviously
the
parent
gets
to
tell
the
subsidiary
what
to
do.
that's
true
in
everything.
it's
true
of
many
cost
allocations
that
we
see.
we
see
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
cost
allocations
coming
into
louisiana
based
on
entergy's
decisions
under
innumerable
types
of
allocation
schemes,
including
the
federal
tariff.
and
eli
has
an
obligation,
even
though
it's
owned
by
a
parent,
to
make
sure
the
parent
follows
the
terms
of
the
tariff,
just
as
the
wholesale
buyer
of
power--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--i'm
arguing
both,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--no.
that...
that
was
as
to
the
refunds.
that
was
as
to
the
period
going
up
to
1996.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
but...
but,
your
honor,
let
me...
let
me
take
this
and
put
it
in...
in
context
here.
when
a
state
commission
decides
issues
of
intrastate
ratemaking,
it
decides
all
kinds
of
questions
of
federal
law.
it
has
to
decide
what
the
internal
revenue
code
requires.
it
has
to
decide
what
the
consolidated
tax
return
provides
for.
it
has
to
decide
sec
allocations
that
are
filed
with
the
sec.
so
along
comes
a
situation
that's
completely
within
its
expertise.
what
does
a
ferc
tariff
require?
and
it
makes
so
many
decisions
involving
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
in
which
it...
it
decides
as...
as
any
other
state
court.
you
apply
federal
law,
you
apply
state
law.
it's
the
whole
body
of
law
that
you're
dealing
with.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
no,
your
honor.
the
ferc
did
not
address
this
question.
this
is
tariff
2.
tariff
1
the
ferc
did
address
and
it
said
the
utility
violated
the
tariff.
now
we're
on
tariff
2,
and
tariff
2
was
designed,
according
to
the
ferc,
to
curb
the
utility's
discretion.
and...
and
that
tariff
2,
designed
to
curb
the
utility's
discretion,
the
utility
then
immediately
proceeded
to
ignore.
and
even
in
their
reply
brief,
they
say,
we
did
nothing
more
than
we
ever
did
before.
that's
on
the
first
page
of
their
reply
brief.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
no.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
right.
that's
true.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--i...
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
i
do
think
that
your
predicate
is
correct.
they...
they...
the
ferc
gave
them
a
tariff.
that's
the
tariff.
the
utility's
decision
doesn't
become
the
tariff.
it's
like
any
contract
case.
if
i
have
a
contract
with
you,
and
i
can
charge
you
5,
and
i
send
you
a
bill
for
10,
that
doesn't...
my
10
doesn't
become
the
tariff.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes.
it
said...
what
it
said
was...
is,
you
go
through
this
process,
step
1,
step
2,
step
3--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--step
4.
the
utility
did
none
of
that.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
right.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
okay.
i'll...
i'll
answer
the
last
question
first.
the
reason
the
appropriate
action
for
the
lpsc
to
take
is
not
to
go
to
ferc
is
because
the
lpsc
has
the
authority
as
part
of
its
state
ratemaking
authority,
as
part
of
state
law
to
make--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--that's
the
question.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
it
wasn't
preempted--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--and,
your
honor,
the...
our
position
is...
and
i
believe
it's
correct...
that
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
power
act
that
preempts
the
state
from
doing
this,
that
the
only
ferc
jurisdiction
to
decide
enforcement
issues
didn't
even...
they
created
it
in
1980
approximately.
they
were
told
in
16
u.s.c.
825m
that
if
they
found
a
violation
of
a
tariff,
they
had
to
go
to
united
states
district
court.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
power
act.
in
fact,
the
senate
had
a
provision
in
the
federal
power
act
that
the
ferc
can
award
remedies
for
violations
of
its
orders.
it
was
pulled
out.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
no,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
if
there's
a
tariff--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--and
it
sets
forth
objective
requirements,
and
it...
and
the
utility
doesn't
follow
those
objective
requirements,
then
they're
not
entitled
to
bill
for
the
units.
that's
all
we're
saying.
we're
not...
this
is
not--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--they
did
say
we
don't
want
to
do
that.
it's
in...
it's
in
the
introduction.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
i'm
saying
that
they...
well,
maybe
i
misunderstood
what
they
don't
want
to
do,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
okay,
they
didn't--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--they...
they--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--not...
not
at
all.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
what
the
federal
power
act
says
is
there's
one
central
body
to
make
the
rate,
to
establish
the
reasonable
and
just
terms
of
the
rate.
all
the
courts
in
the
united
states
can
decide
whether
a
tariff
is
violated,
including
the
state
courts,
and
that's
the
way
it
always
has
been.
in
fact,
the
ferc
wouldn't
hear
the
cases
until
1979.
if
there
was
a
case
of
a
tariff
violation
pending
in
state
court,
you
had
the
potential,
this
potential
of
possible
loss
of
uniformity,
which
never
really
happened.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
a
high-profile
case.
where
are
the
conflicting
decisions?
and
the
reason
is
we
have
an
objective
tariff.
they
violated
the
objective
tariff.
nobody
can
really
dispute
that.
it
was
litigated
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
no.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
well,
your...
your
honor,
i...
i
will
respectfully
disagree
that
this
as
big
a
problem
as...
as
you
are
suggesting.
and
i'll...
i'll
tell
you
that
literally
billions
of
dollars
of
costs
are
split
up
by
entergy
among
its
companies,
only
a
very
small
sliver
under
the
federal
power
act.
now,
they
split
up
these
costs
from
energy
operations,
which
is
a
nuclear
company;
energy
services,
which
is
a
service
company,
by
allocating
them
into
the
jurisdictions.
anytime
there
would
be
a
conflicting
decision,
you
could
have...
supposedly
you
could
have
chaos.
what
really
happens
is
the
utility
tries
to
shove
as
much
costs
as
it
possibly
can
into
the
jurisdictions
which
are
reviewing
the
rates
frequently.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
right.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor,
and...
and
bear
in
mind
what
justice
stevens
was
addressing
there.
the
issue
of
prudence...
and
the
court
were
addressing,
but
the
issue
of
prudence
is
an
issue
is
that
comes
up
in
making
the
rate.
the
ferc
in
the
federal
power
act
is...
is
authorized
to
establish
just
and
reasonable
rates.
if
you're
going
to
raise
prudence,
you
raise
it
in
the
proceeding
where
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
gets
established.
we
admit
they
have
that.
then
you
have
the
next
question.
if
they
start
violating
their
contract,
is
that
something
that
the
states
can't
look
at?
and
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
power
act
that
suggests
that
states--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--no.
the
prior
violation.
this
is
the
second
tariff,
your
honor.
this
is
a
new
tariff
that
sets
conditions
which
were
supposedly
designed
to
curb
their
discretion.
but
going
back
to
mp&l,
this
court's
decision
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
mississippi
public
service
commission.
it
reversed
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
it
affirmed
the
mississippi
public
service
commission.
in...
in
that
decision
of
the
mississippi
public
service
commission,
327
million
will
be
incurred
under
the
ferc
tariff.
they...
they
had
to
actually
estimate
what
would
be
incurred.
now,
if
you
hand
the
utility
the
right
to
tell
the
state
public
service
commission
that,
oh,
it
will
be
500
million,
do
they
have
to
pass
it
through?
if
this
court
is
going
to
give
the
sword
of
preemption
to
utilities,
and
basically,
there's
a
test,
you
know.
we've
got
concurrent
jurisdiction.
the
test
for
concurrent
jurisdiction
or
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
unmistakable
intent
of
congress.
congress
had
it
in
there,
pulled
it
out
of
the...
in
the
senate
report.
the
ferc
can...
can
hear
violations.
it
was
in
the
senate
version
of
the
bill
in
1935.
if
you
look
on
page
6
of
our
brief,
you'll
find
that
the
senate
pulled
it
out.
the
ferc
had
no...
no...
jurisdiction
to
hear
tariff
violation
cases.
it
could
go
to
court.
that's
16
u.s.c.,
section
825m.
in
about
1980,
the
ferc
said,
well,
you
know
what?
we're
going
to
infer
the
power
to
do
that.
and
for
the
first
time
ever,
because
up
until
then,
the
ferc
had
been
refusing
to
hear
cases
that
were
pending
in
state
court,
wouldn't
even
exercise
primary
jurisdiction.
now,
obviously,
if
you
have
exclusive
jurisdiction,
there's
no
need
for
a
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine.
they
wouldn't
even
exercise
primary
jurisdiction.
they
left
it
to
the
state
courts,
all
the
state
courts.
now,
if
you
leave
it
to
the
state
courts,
what
is...
how
can
you
possibly
say
a
state
ratemaking
agency,
which
decides
issues
of
federal
law,
contracts,
all
the
time,
has
to
interpret
allocations,
has
to
decide
if
they're
right...
how
could
the
federal
power
act
have
taken
away
their
power
when
the
federal
power
act
was
passed--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--the
post-1997--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--august...
it's
august
5th,
1997.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
you
have...
you
have
costs
incurred
in
'96,
which
interestingly
enough,
were
incurred
in
violation
of
a
ferc
tariff
as
determined
by
the
ferc.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
as
determined
by
the
ferc.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
going
forward.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
right.
that's
when
the
new
tariff--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--that's
when
the
new
tariff
became
effective.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
i
don't,
but
i'll
be
happy
to
look.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
it's
the
amendment.
yes.
the
amendment
took
effect
august
5th,
19--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
your
honor,
i
believe
they
did
decide
it
on
the
basis
that
i've
been
arguing,
but
i'll
concede
that
that
language
is
sitting
in
there.
it's
wrong.
and--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--it's
wrong.
i
think
it
relates
to
the
refunds,
but
it's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
this
court's
law,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine,
the
fact
that
the
states
have
always
had
the
power
to
decide
this,
the
fact
that
the
ferc
had
to
infer
jurisdiction
to
decide
tariff
violations
in
the...
in
around
1979
or
1980.
the
ferc
has
never
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
decide
if
a
contract
has
been
violated.
the
arkla
against
hall
case.
that
case
is
a
case
that
came
through
the...
this...
the
louisiana
courts.
this
court
held
there's
a
difference
between
establishing
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
and
enforcing
the
contract.
and
if
you
go
back
to
the...
the
pan
american
case
decided
by
this
court,
this
court
held
that
with
regard
to
contract
enforcement
issues,
which
somebody
was
arguing
need
to
be
decided
by
the
ferc,
there
was
a
state
proceeding
pending.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
because,
your
honor,
the...
it's
a
contract.
this
is
one
of
the
sections
of
the
contract.
this
is
the
section
that...
it's
an
amendment
to
the
contract
that
was
approved
by
the
ferc.
it's
a
contract
between
the
parties--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--pardon?
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
the
parties
to
the
contract
are
the
five
operating
companies,
plus--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--only
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
entergy...
not
under
the
contract,
not
because
the
contract
says
so.
they
don't
have
to
take
an
illegal
charge.
but
as
a
matter
of
practice,
i
admit
that
the
big
boss
of
entergy
can
tell
the
operating
companies
what
to
do,
and
they're
not
going
to
lose
their
jobs
over
it.
so
they'll
take
the
charge
if
it's
an
overcharge.
you're
darned
right.
but
not
because
the
contract
says
so,
your
honor.
not
at
all.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
we're--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--we
are...
we
are
really...
the
contract
itself--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--more
or
less
becomes
the
tariff,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
there
is
no
separate
tariff.
it's
just
a
contract.
it
becomes
a
rate
schedule
filed
with
the
ferc.
but
in
pan
american,
this
court
said,
you
know,
in...
in
its
nature...
by
its
nature,
a
contract
like
that
is
a
state
court
contract.
and
the...
and
the
court
made
the
statement
by
the
fact
that
everybody
knows
there's
a
scheme
of
federal
regulation
doesn't
change
that.
and
the
state
courts...
and
i
think
it
implicitly
means
this--
mr.
michael
r.
fontham
--yes,
your
honor.
