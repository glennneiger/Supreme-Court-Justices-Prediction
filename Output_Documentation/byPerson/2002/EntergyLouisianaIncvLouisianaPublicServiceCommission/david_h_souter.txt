justice
david
h.
souter
could...
could
you
explain
one
thing
to
me?
and
that
is,
why
was
the
period
so
defined?
is
it
simply
that
it
was,
with
respect
to
that
period,
that
actual
figures
were
introduced
before
ferc?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
date
of
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
so,
in
effect,
that...
ferc
was
done
with
it
at
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but...
but
was
there--
justice
david
h.
souter
--was
there
any
question
in
the
terms
of
the
order
that
the
order
was
intended
to
operate
prospectively
until
ferc
changed
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
--am
i...
am
i
correct
in
assuming,
as
i
have
throughout
the...
reading
the
briefs
here,
that
the...
the
costs
that
a
given
operating
company
incurs
within
its
power
pool
is
essentially
the
same
issue
as
the
wholesale
rate
that
a...
that
a
totally
independent
company
might
pay
when
it...
when
it
bought
wholesale
off
the...
the
grid?
is...
is
that
a...
it
seems
to
me
in...
in
each
case,
the
operating
company
is
buying
power
at
wholesale,
whether
it
does
it
within
its
group
or
whether
it
does
it
on
an
open
market,
and
that's
what
in
each
case
ferc
is
regulating.
is...
is
that
fair?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
when
one
of
those
transactions
is
the...
is
the...
in
effect,
the
acquisition
of
power
by
a
local
operating
company,
that
transaction
is
economically,
i
guess,
the
equivalent
of
buying
wholesale
by
an
independent
company
that
is
not
part
of
a
power
pool.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
no,
i
understand
that.
and...
and...
but
ferc
also
has
general
authority
over
wholesale
interstate
sales.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that...
so
that
in
relation
to
what
a...
the
reason
i'm
getting
at
it
is,
in
relation
to
what
a
state
utilities
commission
can
do,
the
state
utilities
commission,
i
take
it,
is
in
the
same
position
vis-a-vis
eli
that
it
would
be
if
eli
were
a
totally
independent
company
buying
wholesale
off
the
grid.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the...
the
problem
is
that...
not
that
the
costs
would
be
trapped,
but
that
ferc
has
said
it's
not
trapped.
that's...
that's
the
point.
i
mean,
lots
of
utilities
lose
money
because
costs
are
trapped.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
real
point
is
here
ferc
has
said
they
can
do
it.
that's...
that's
the
only
point
that
you're
making,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
a
ferc
question,
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
take
it
you
agree
with
mr.
carpenter
that
the
state
can
be
heard
on
this
issue
as
an
intervenor
who
may
raise
the
issue
before
ferc.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
case,
it
can
get
to
ferc
if
it
has
a
gripe.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
all
i'm...
that's
all
i'm--
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
question--
justice
david
h.
souter
didn't
ferc...
didn't
ferc
also
say
that
the
rates
that
had
resulted
during
the
period
prior
to
the
amendment
were
just
and
reasonable
rates?
justice
david
h.
souter
absolutely.
they're
looking
retroactively.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
having
done
so,
and
having
set
the
rate,
how
then
is
a
state
utilities
commission,
in
effect,
able
to
go
behind
that
determination?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
way
to
look
at
the
problem
this
way?
ferc
says
you
may
charge
a
certain
tariff.
we're
not
coming
up
with
the
actual
number
now--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
it
depends
on
facts
that
will
vary
over
time.
you
may...
we...
we
are
approving
a
tariff.
you
supply
the
number
and
you
must
supply
the
number
according
to
certain
conditions.
and
what
the
louisiana
commission
is
now
saying
is,
the
number
that
you
supplied
was
a
number
that
violates
those
conditions.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
fact
remains
that
on
the
face
of
it,
ferc
has
said,
if
you
come
up
with
the
number,
that's
the
tariff.
so
if
you
are
going
to
challenge
that
number,
aren't
you,
in
effect,
challenging
a
ferc
determination?
and
to
do
that,
don't
you
have
to
go
back
to
ferc
and
say,
they
didn't
follow
your
conditions,
and
therefore
you,
ferc,
should
tell
them
that
that
number
is,
in
fact,
wrong
and
they
can't
charge
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
wrong
with
that
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
except
that
in
this
case...
and...
and
maybe
this
is
where
i'm
going
wrong.
tell
me
if
i
am.
in
this
case,
i
thought
ferc
did
not
say
the
number
is
5.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but...
but
at
the
end...
but
what
ferc
is
saying
is,
if...
if
you
go
through
that
process,
the
number
you
get
at
the
end
of
the
process
is
what
our
tariff
guarantees
you
to
charge.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
this
contract
the
contract
that
has
been
accepted
by
and
approved
by
ferc
and,
in
effect,
incorporated
into
the
tariff?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
we're
not
talking
about
a
freestanding
contract.
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
talking,
in
effect,
about
a
term
which
the
tariff
incorporates
by
its
reference
to
the
contract.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--right.
that's--
