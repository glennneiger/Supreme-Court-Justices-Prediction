so
the
difference
is
unlike
a
filed
rate,
which
is
a
number,
here
is
not
a
precise
number.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it...
and
it's
going
to
change
constantly.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it...
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
public
service
commission,
they
have
to
approve
the
local
rates
periodically,
and
how
does
the
timing
of
the
thing
work?
if
the
public
service
commission
has
to
go
to
ferc
and
then
there's
a
proceeding,
and
by
that
time
the
year
is
over.
justice
ruth

mr.
fontham,
i'm
a
little
confused
on
who
is
the
they
because
my
understanding
was
that
the
louisiana
company,
eli,
had
no
say
in
this,
that
it
was
the
entergy,
the...
the
holding
company...
the...
for
all
of
these
five
companies,
that
gave
the
instructions.
and
it
wasn't
as
though
eli
could
say,
well,
we
think
you
allocated
too
much
to
us.
you're
making
us
pay
too
much.
the...
each
unit
is
bound
by
what
entergy
says.
so
the
they
seems
to
me
to
be
entergy,
but
the
louisiana
public
service
commission
has
only
eli
before
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
how
can
it
say
that
eli
was
at
fault
for
something
that
eli
is
locked
into
by
virtue
of
being
part
of
this
multistate--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
each
state's
public
service
commission
can
do
what
the
louisiana
commission
has
done,
you
could
have
chaos.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
will
say,
my
utility
was
underpaid.
another
one
will
say,
ours
was
overpaid.
and
each
one
could
do
exactly
what
the
louisiana
commission
has
done.
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
that
just
cries
out
for
having
the
one
decisionmaker,
ferc.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
this
a
contract
enforcement
proceeding?
i
don't
follow.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
contract
between
whom?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
is
the...
who
are
the
parties
to
this
contract?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
agreed
with
me
earlier
that
the
operating
companies
have
to
follow
the
instructions
of
entergy.
