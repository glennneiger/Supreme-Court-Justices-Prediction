we'll

now
in
number

federal
communications
commission
v.
nextwave
personal
communications
and
a
companion
case.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
mr.
clement,
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
the
question
presented
speaks
of
an
obtained
option
automatically
canceled.
that
suggests
that
it
is
indeed
automatic.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
automatic
means
without
any
discretion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
doesn't
sound
at
all
like
the
question
presented,
which
says
at
auction,
automatically
cancel
upon
the
winning
bidder's
failure
to
make
timely
payments
to
fulfill
its
winning
bid.
it...
when
you
were
drafting
that
question,
it
sounds
like
your
perception
of
the
thing
was
quite
different
than
it
is
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
same
order
repeatedly
refers
to
the
automatic
cancellation
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
clement.
mr.
franklin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
refer
to
it
as
a
regulatory
determination
which,
of
course,
assumes
the
whole
point
at
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
is
it
phrased
in
terms
of
an
automatic
cancellation
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
franklin.
mr.
verrilli.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--apply
to
the
bankruptcy
order
in
that
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
it's
not
an
animal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
the
fcc...
can
an
fcc
licensee
encumber
the
license?
can
it
pledge
the
license
to
some...
to
a
bank
that's
giving
it
a
loan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
verrilli.
mr.
tribe,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
clement,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
01-653,
federal
communications
commission
versus
nextwave
personal
communications
and
a
companion
case
will
be
announced

scalia.
