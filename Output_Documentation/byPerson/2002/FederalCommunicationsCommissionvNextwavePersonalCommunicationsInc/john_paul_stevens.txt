i
agree,
you've
said
two
different
things
there.
if
it's
automatic,
it
happened
without
whatever
happened
next.
but
you're
saying
it
automatically
canceled
after
attempts
to
collect
failed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
when
was
the
automatic
trigger?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
is
that
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
you
have
the
authority
to
relax
the
payment
date?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
true--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
that's
true,
why
don't
you
settle
the
case
today?
they
say
they
can
pay
in
full
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
the
option
to
cure...
if
you
wanted
to
settle,
would
you
be
disabled
from
settling,
or
could
you
settle,
decide,
well,
we
think
it
would
be
wise
regulation
now
to
accept
the
payment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question
about
your
interpretation
of
the
automatic
cancellation?
is
it
the
commission's
view
that
they
could...
there
would
be
a
cancellation,
they
could
reauction
the
licenses,
and
that
the
original
licensee
would
still
remain
liable
for
the
entire
debt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they
would
remain
liable
for
the
entire
debt,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
what
do
you
say
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
point
that
the
statute
really
deals
with
a
situation
in
which
the
government
agency
is
not
the
creditor?
that's
what
it
basically
was--
