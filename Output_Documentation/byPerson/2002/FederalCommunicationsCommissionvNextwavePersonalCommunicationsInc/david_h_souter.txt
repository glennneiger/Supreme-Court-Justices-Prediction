h.

you
say
a
public
interest
determination,
but
the
only
correlation
that
seems
clear
to
me
is
a
purely
economic
correlation.
when
the
value
of
the
leases
dropped,
the
fcc
apparently
went
into
the
bankruptcy
court
and
said,
we
want
our
full
$4
billion,
and
when
the
value
of
the
leases
went
up,
the
fcc
took
the
position,
we
want
to
reauction
them
and
get
the
increase
in
value.
it
seems
at
each
point
at
which
the
fcc
made
a
decision,
it
was
making
an
economic
decision,
not
a
regulatory
decision.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
the
regulatory
purpose
is
having
financially
responsible
drivers
so
people
don't
run
around
the
road
hurting
people
and
leaving
them
to
bleed
on
their
own
account.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
just
as
much
a
regulatory
purpose
in
that
hypo
as
there
is
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
just
follow
up
on
that?
i
mean,
i
assumed
that
was
not
an
issue
here
because
they
had
auctioned
them
off
again
and
they
had
mitigated
their
damages.
is
that
the
way
the
commission
treated
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
can...
on
that
point,
do
you
agree
that
the
statute
is
a
response
to...
the
perez
case,
the
automobile
cancellation?
justice
david
h.
souter
there
was
a
regulatory
motive
there.
the
regulatory
motive
is
financially
responsible
drivers.
the
benefits
of
that
are
obvious.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
that
situation
is
supposed
to
be
covered
by
the
statute,
then
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
so
would
this
one
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
then
sole
emphasis
and
sole
purpose
really
boils
down
not
to
exclusiveness
but
a
kind
of
proximate
or
principal
causation
theory,
and
if
that's
the
case,
certainly
here
the
fcc
treated
the
debtor
relationship
as
the
principal
determinant
of
the
various
steps
that
it
took.
first,
it
insisted
on
its
4
billion,
then
when
the
market
changed
it
said,
forget
it,
we
want
to
reauction,
and
if
it's
a
principal
or
proximate
kind
of
causation
theory,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
prevail.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
doesn't
automatic
mean
automatic?
your
brother
has
just
explained
that
automatic
means
sometimes.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
means
automatic
without
teeth.
justice
david
h.
souter
automatic
except
where
it
isn't.
