justice

bader

that's
something
that
i
don't
fully
grasp
in
your
argument.
first
you
say,
this
is
fully
automatic,
this
cancellation
of
the
license.
you
don't
pay
up,
license
gone.
but
then
you
say,
but
we
can
extend
the
time
if
we
want
to.
we
can
use
our
discretion.
well,
the
automatic
argument
seems
at
war
with
the
discretion
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
mr.
franklin,
why
didn't
congress
provide
an
exception,
as
it
did
in,
for
perishable
commodities
for
the
department
of
agriculture?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there
is
this
nonbankruptcy
overriding
concern,
then
we
have
one
example
where
congress
responded
to
it
by
saying
the
bankruptcy
provision
isn't
going
to
prevail.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
stop
you
in
your
hypothetical,
because
i
thought
you
don't
get
the
license
till
after
you
have
make
the
down
payment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
they
didn't
have
any
license
until
they
did
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
know
how
the
commission
has
interpreted
it.
i
mean,
they
did
say,
we're
going
to
give
you
a
moratorium.
we're
going
to
give
you
a
chance,
and
we'll
make
a
deal
for
you.
you
give
back
some
of
those
licenses,
and
we'll
work
out
a
settlement,
and
for
one
year
the
fcc
said,
it's
okay
if
you
don't
pay
while
we're
considering
some
kind
of
settlement,
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
there
had
been
such
a
settlement,
then
there
could
have
been
some,
at
least,
licenses
retained
even
though
there
had
been
the
nonpayment,
which
is
supposed
to
be
an
automatic
trigger.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
at
least
according
to
this
presentation
the
fcc
said
that
it
does
have
discretion
to
grant
relief
from
the
automatic
cancellation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
does
the
word
"solely"
do?
i
can
follow
what
you
just
said
if
it
simply
said
because
of,
but
congress
wrote
solely,
and
that
has
to
have
some
function.
