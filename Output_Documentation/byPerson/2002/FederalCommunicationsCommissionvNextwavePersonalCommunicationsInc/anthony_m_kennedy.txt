but
your
point
is,
is
that
the
regulatory
discretion
and
authority
of
the
agency
has
been
replaced
under
the
statutory
scheme
in
large
part
by
the
dynamics
of
the
free
market.
the
highest
bidder
shows
us
which
is
the
most
qualified
person.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
to
the
first
part,
isn't
the
bankruptcy
code
and
the
policy
of
new
start
and
creditors
and
so
forth,
isn't
that
really
part
of
the
free
market
structure?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
fcc
practice,
have
you
ever
revoked
a
license
and
then
decided
that
you're
going
to
reissue
it
to
the
initial
holder?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
a
reconsideration
order
is
different,
but
a
new
issuance
it
seems
to
me
is
quite
questionable
so
far
as
the
discretion
of
the
agency,
and
i
think
i
agree
with
some
of
my
colleagues,
i'm
not
sure
that's
before
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
rationale
offered
by
the
commission
here
was
that
the
policies
of
the
fcc
outweigh
the
policies
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
is
there
authority
for
us
to
defer
to
the
commission
in
making
that
kind
of
a
determination?
i
mean,
why
don't
we
defer
to
the
bankruptcy
court,
which
says
the
policies
of
the
bankruptcy
act
are
more
important
than
the
policies
of
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
that's
the
explicit
rationale
of
the
commission.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
it
said.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
you
don't
defend
the
rationale
offered
by
the
commission?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assuming
we
think
there's
a
conflict,
is
there
any
authority
for
the
agency's
assertion
that
it
has
the
authority
to
determine
which
statute
outweighs
the
other?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this,
they're
saying
that
they're
not
going
to
take
bankruptcy
considerations
into
account.
