justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
the
question.
that's
my
question.
as
i
read
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me,
for
at
least
your
argument's
sake,
it
is
solely
because,
and
moreover,
of
course
this
statute
governs
the
fcc,
but
in
reading
the
statute,
i
don't
see
how
this
statute
was
at
all
intended
to
govern
the
instance
in
which
the
government
is
acting
as
creditor
in
respect
to
receiving
payment
for
a
good
that
it
has
sold.
now,
i
base
that
on
first
reading
the
purposes
of
this
in
the
history,
and
reading
the
whole
legislative
history,
which
will
not
convince
some
of
my
colleagues,
but
nonetheless
is
a
factor
in
what
i
think,
and
i
think
that
this
is
clearly
about
a
future
loan,
a
future
situation
in
which
the
future
situation,
the
government
is
forbidden
to
discriminate
against
a
human
being
because
he
was
once
in
bankruptcy.
this
seems
to
be
to
balance,
to
bring
back
into
balance
the
government
vis-a-vis
the
private
creditor.
if
you're
right
in
your
interpretation,
and
i
am
wrong,
i
see
no
way
whatsoever
in
which
the
government
would
have
the
right
to
take
a
secured
interest
or
in
any
other
way
collect
a
debt
which
a
human
being
owes
it
for
buying
a
license.
now,
that's
my
question.
i
want
to
get
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
far,
i'm
trying
to
get
the
answer
to
my
question,
and
so
far,
in
terms
of
my
interpretation,
the
second
point
you
made
is
in
terms
of
to
the
applicability,
if
my
interpretation
is
right.
i
want
to
know
if
it's
right,
and
i
only
come
up
with
one
thing
that
you've
said
so
far,
which
is
text,
which
is
important--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
i
learned
the
second
year
of
law
school,
i
learned
the
second
year
of
law
school...
and
obviously
many
of
my
colleagues
don't
agree
with
me,
but
i
learned
the
second
year
of
law
school
that
when
you
have
a
text
which
says
"all",
that
there
are
often
implied,
not-written
exceptions.
all
animals
in
the
park.
no
animals
in
the
park
doesn't
necessarily
apply
to
a
pet
oyster,
okay,
and
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
an
oyster
in
my
course
in
biology
is
an
animal,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
in
yours
it
was
a
rock,
or
a
vegetable
or
a
mineral.
but
regardless,
you
see
my
point,
and
my
question,
of
course,
is
that
since
that's
how
i
read
statutes...
not
everybody...
is
that
i
find
exceptions
implicit
in
statutes
where
to
fail
to
read
that
exception
is
to
destroy
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
is
not
backed
by
anything
in
respect
to
what
the
people
who
wrote
it
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
believe
it
destroys
the
purpose
of
the
statute
because
i
see
no
way
in
which
the
government
as
creditor
could
collect
the
money
it's
owed
through
a
secured
interest
in
what
they've
sold,
if
my
interpretation
is
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i'm
putting
that
as
strong
as
i
can.
i
want
to
get
a
complete
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
stop
you
right
there?
how
does
it
do
that?
because
when
it
goes
to
enforce
its
secured
interest,
i
take
it
it's
revoking
the
license
because
of
the
money
that
was
due
it.
and
so
how
do
you...
when
you
go
in
to
enforce
your
secured
interest
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
the
bankruptcy
judge
on
the
other
side
reads
525(c),
525
on
your
interpretation,
how
does
he
do
it?
because
it's
just
like
this
case.
they're
revoking
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
it
should.
that's
logical.
my
point
is,
how
does
the
bankruptcy
judge
at
that
point
get
around
the
language
of
525,
on
your
interpretation
of
it,
since
on
your
interpretation
of
it,
you
would
be
taking
back
the
license
because
of
failure
to
pay
a
debt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
cannot
take
a
secured
interest
in
the
license?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no...
well,
they
want
their
money
is
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
want
their
money,
but
there
are
taxicab
licenses,
there
are
nuclear
power
licenses...
licensing
is
the
most
common
thing
in
the
world.
you
often
pay
for
it,
and
what
i
really
am
worried
about
is,
imagine
they
took
a
secured
interest
in
the
license,
and
on
your
interpretation,
how
do
they
get
the
taxicab
license
back--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
the
guy
never
paid
the
$100,000
for?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
could
get
it
back...
in
other
words,
they
could
take
it
back
because
they
didn't
revoke
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
a
creditor,
i'm
a
private
creditor,
i
say
i
have
a
secured
interest
in
this,
it's
mine,
okay.
i
sell
it
at
auction.
now,
the
fcc--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
the
part
that's
precisely
bothering
me,
my
situation
is
no
worse.
when
i
read
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me
my
situation
is
worse,
because
if
the
statute
applies
here,
it
applies
there,
and
you
and
your
colleague
both
tell
me
no,
that
isn't
so,
and
if
you
can
show
me
it
isn't
so,
my
problem
disappears.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly
right.
why
didn't
you
argue
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
if
they
did,
it's
such
an
obvious
argument
that
i
feel
there's
something
wrong
with
it
if
you
didn't
argue
it.
