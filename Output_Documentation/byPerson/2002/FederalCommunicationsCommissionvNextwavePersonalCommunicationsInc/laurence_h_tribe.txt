mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
clearly,
we're
dealing
in
525
with
something
that
is
an
exercise
of
regulatory
power,
and
as
several
members
of
the
court
have
noted,
it's
always
possible
to
say,
even
though
we
are
revoking
or
canceling
this
license
automatically
because
you
didn't
make
the
payment,
we
have
other
motives
in
mind,
responsible,
financially
responsible
drivers
on
the
road.
we
are
not
simply
out
to
get
you
because
of
the
dollars.
that's,
of
course,
not
what
this
statute
is
about.
the
whole
point
of
the
perez
decision
was
to
get
rid
of
kesler
and
reitz,
which
required
peering
into
the
mind
of
the
bureaucrats,
not
always
a
wonderful
vision
to
behold,
and
not
clear.
this
is
a
causation
provision,
and
let
me
turn
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
from
the
perspective
of
creditors
who
need
to
be
able
to
rely
on
a
bright
line
test
of
whether
something
was
done
solely
because
of
nonpayment
of
a
dischargeable
debt,
or
solely
because
of
insolvency,
or
solely
because
of
an
invocation
of
chapter
11.
the
word
solely,
i
think,
does
serve
a
function
there,
and
that
is,
in
its
absence
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
for
a
licensee
in
regulatory
default,
a
licensee
who
hadn't
built
out,
to
hide
behind
the
existence
of
a
fiscal
default
and
say,
you
see,
it's
because
of
the
fact
that
i
didn't
make
a
payment,
not
because
i
didn't
build
out.
then
one
has
a
complicated
mess,
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
creditors
who
need
to
know
whether
an
agency
is
going
to
pull
out
the
lifeline
without
which
this
entire
edifice
collapses
and
is
just
a
bunch
of
hardware,
not
worth
anything
more
than
the
separate
parts,
from
the
point
of
view
of
creditors
who
need
to
know,
it
seems
to
me
a
very
clear
test
is
needed,
and
that
is,
was
this
the
sole
trigger?
have
they
come
up
with
some
other
substantive,
independent
basis
which
either
was
the
necessary
cause
or
a
sufficient
cause?
that's
what
the
d.c.
circuit
said,
and
it
makes
sense.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i...
in
a
way,
i
think
that
that
makes
our
point
all
the
stronger,
that
is,
even
when
the
agency
has
no
conflict
of
interest,
it
might
not
be
in
it
for
the
money,
and
one
wonders
here
why,
for
example,
why
they
don't
yank
the
license
when
the
debt
is
owed
to
private
creditors?
doesn't
that
show
in
just
the
same
way
that
they're
not
reliable?
that
is,
in
this
very
case--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
money--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
license
on
my
interpretation--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--does
not
cancel
and
at
confirmation
the
license
is
one
of
the
assets
of
the
estate,
and
at
that
point--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
they
don't
take
it
back.
that
is,
when...
there
are
a
number
of
things
in
the
estate
at
confirmation.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
the
bankruptcy
court
is
filled
with
elaborate
rules
about
when
you
can
and
cannot
foreclose.
that
is,
an
asset
is
part
of
the
estate
at
confirmation,
and
whether
you're
going
to
be
able
to
get
your
money
back
is
a
function
of
whether
you
are
under
or
oversecured.
there
are
provisions
in
1111(b)
for
dealing
with
both
situations.
your
situation
is
no
worse
when
you
are
a
regulator
than
the
bank
of
america,
or
one
of
the
clients
in
our
case,
citicorp,
and
no
better.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
what
i'm
saying,
justice
breyer,
is
that
after
bankruptcy,
if
nextwave,
for
example,
were
to
emerge
from
bankruptcy
they
would
still
have
the
license,
but
only
on
conditions
in
which
you
as
the
fcc,
like
other
creditors,
in
light
of
your
secured
interest,
had
taken
an
appropriate
piece
of
the
pie.
you
don't
get
it
all,
that's
the
point.
nor
does
a
private
creditor
get
to
grab
the
license
and
all
the
value
from
all
the
other
creditors
and,
in
fact,
when
you
are
an
agency
that
is
wearing
really
two
sets
of
shoes,
the
ordinary
regulator's
running
shoes
but
also
the
wing
tips
of
the
creditor
agency,
it
makes
the
situation
worse,
not
better.
that
is,
this
law
is
designed
to
assure
that
even
the
agency,
which
does
not
have
a
monetary
interest,
can't
simply
yank
all
the
value
for
itself
because
it
has
the
power
over
this
license.
if
the
agency,
on
top
of
all
that,
is
a
creditor
and
has
that
additional
set
of
incentives,
then
it's
all
the
worse.
you
wonder,
for
example,
why
it
is
that
in
the
mmds
licenses,
in
which
there
are
licenses
that
are
held
by
a
number
of
bankrupt
licensees
who
did
not
make
the
payments
they
promised
to
make,
why
it
is
that
the
fcc
does
not
regard
them
as
not
having
been
what
they
looked
like
at
the
time
of
the
bid.
the
reason
is
that
it's
been
paid
in
full.
so
it
really
is
a
situation
in
which
the
fcc's
position
as
a
creditor
should
not
redound
to
its
credit.
if
anything,
that
makes
this
statute
all
the
more
vital.
the
capital
formation
that
is
necessary
to
make
309(j)
work,
to
make
it
possible,
justice
scalia,
sometimes
not
to
demand
all
the
money
up
front,
but
to
have
something
more
creative,
maybe
demand
letters
of
credit,
guarantees,
none
of
that
can
work
if
creditors
who
put
in
over
half
a
billion
dollars,
not
in
a
gamble
but
on
a
very
careful
business
plan
that
was
completely
carried
out,
they're
not
providing
service,
but
catch-22,
it's
because
their
attempt
to
emerge
and
fully
cure
any
default
was
frustrated
by
the
agency
that
saw
pie
in
the
sky,
large
numbers.
in
that
situation,
for
the
agency
to
be
able
to
collapse
the
capital
formation
here
tells
us
something
rather
unpleasant
about
the
future.
how
likely
is
it
that
citicorp
and
the
california
and
kansas
pension
funds
and
all
of
the
other
organizations
that
have
put
money
in
on
reliance
on
the
way
section
525
works
will
do
this
again
next
time
around?
the
formation
of
capital,
the
market
on
which
the
fcc
chose
to
rely,
choosing
to
rely
in
the
capacity
of
a
first
lender,
with
no
more
or
less
secured
protection
than
others,
that
whole
system
depends
on,
in
the
most
literal
sense,
the
rule
of
law.
it
does
not
depend
on
the
question
whether
we
can
attribute
to
the
regulator
some
motive
that
does
not
relate
solely
to
the
money.
so
if
the
system
is
to
work
the
way
the
fcc
claims,
525
is
a
dead
letter.
now,
if
you
were
right,
justice
breyer,
if
there
really
was
a
problem
that
couldn't
be
solved
in
the
way
the
confirmation
rules
work,
in
the
way
the
pie
is
divided
up,
then
maybe,
as
with
perishable
commodities,
there
would
be
a
problem
for
congress
to
solve.
congress
has
in
section
523
enumerated
18
categories
of
debts
that
are
not
dischargeable
in
bankruptcy,
and
sometimes
it
does
it
in
another
statute,
not
always
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
these
are
policy
judgments
about
whether
something
is
unique
about
the
situation
that
requires
treating
the
government
in
some
different
way,
the
way
the
department
of
agriculture
is
treated.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you.
