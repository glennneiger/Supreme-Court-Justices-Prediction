mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
section
525
of
the
bankruptcy
code
permits
a
bankrupt
company
and
a
bankruptcy
judge
to
override
the
fcc's
regulatory
determination
of
the
public
interest
and
thereby
allow
the
company
to
retain
an
exclusive
entitlement
to
use
the
nation's
airwaves
that
the
fcc
and
congress
have
determined
is
not
in
the
public
interest
for
it
to
hold.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
i
don't
think
it...
i
think
that
that,
in
fact,
is
undisputed
as
this
case
comes
before
the
court,
that
the
fcc
had
valid
regulatory
reasons
for
taking
the
action
it
did.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
because
the
automatic
cancellation
happened
in
november
of
1998,
but
one
cannot
look
at
that
as
a
mere
snapshot.
you
have
to
look
at
the
reasons
why
the
fcc
had
that
rule
and
the
reasons
why
the
fcc
had
their
auction--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
i'm
not
aware
of
a
statute
like
that,
that
says,
solely
because--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--i
know
that,
but--
[laughter]
but
it's
important.
the
section
525
is
drafted...
is
an
antidiscrimination
statute,
but
it's
drafted
differently
than
other...
title
vii,
for
example,
does
not
use
the
word--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
with
respect,
your
honor,
the
term
because,
when
it
is
used
in
antidiscrimination
statutes,
and
we
have
cited
cases
on
page
3
of
our
reply
brief,
is
used
to
mean
motive.
because
means,
for
the
reason
that.
that's
what
the
definition
of
the
word,
because...
when
congress
drafted
section
525,
it
drafted
the
statute
narrowly.
it
intended
to
prohibit
arbitrary--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--i
think
that...
under
section
525,
the
mere
fact
that
an
agency
has
said
it
has
a
regulatory
motive
is
not
sufficient.
it
has
to
be
a
valid
one
that
is
not
simply
an
arbitrary
attempt
to
collect
a
debt,
and,
your
honors--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--but
in
perez
the
court
examined
that
motive
and
determined
that
looking
at
the
statute
and
looking
at
the
way
it
operated,
in
fact,
as
the
court
put
it,
the
sole
emphasis
of
the
statute
was
not
the
regulatory
purpose.
it
was...
as
the
court
said,
the
sole
emphasis
was
the
collection
of
debts.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i
don't
think
that
section
525
embodies
a
causation
theory
in
the
way
that
your
honor
is
postulating.
i
think
that
section
525
most
specifically
speaks
about
which
are
the
valid
considerations
that
an
agency
can
look
at,
and
in
this
case
one
needs
to
look
at
the
auction
system
that
congress
established.
congress
intended
to
replace
the
cumbersome
comparative
hearings
and
unjust
lotteries
of
the
past
with
a
new,
more
streamlined
mechanism
under
which
an
entitlement
to
use
our
airwaves,
everybody's
airwaves,
is
allocated
to
the
person
that,
or
the
company
that
values
it
the
most,
and
the
way
we
know
that
is
that
they
must
make
good
on
the
promises
embodied
in
their
auction
bid.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
automatic--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--automatic
means
automatic,
although
there
are
opportunities,
as--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well--
[laughter]
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
cancellation
was
automatic,
but
that
it
was
supported
by
valid
regulatory
concerns,
and
those
concerns...
i
mean,
the
auction
system
mandated
by
congress
would
be
completely
vitiated
if
a
bidder...
and
i
represent
people
that,
companies
that
are
repeat
players
in
this
game.
bidders
cannot
come
in
and
obtain
an
entitlement
to
use
our
airwaves
by
promising
that
they
will
make
a
payment,
and
that's
the
reason
why
they're
selected--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
i...
no
exception
was
needed
here.
the
agriculture
programs
allow
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
do
what
the
fcc
may
not
do
here,
and
that
is
to
cancel
a
license
solely
because
of
a
failure,
a
bankruptcy
status.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
statutes
that
are
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
the
agriculture
statutes,
they
allow
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
terminate
an
agricultural
license
where
somebody
has
been
discharged
from
bankruptcy,
ever
in
the
past,
or
even
if
a
partner
or
a
shareholder
of
a
company
has
been
discharged
from
bankruptcy.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
that
specific
exemption
makes
clear
that
congress...
there
was
a
debate
in
congress
as
to
whether
the
solely
because
language
would
cover
that,
whether
there
was
a
regulatory
purpose
or
not,
and
congress
felt
like
they
didn't
want
to
have
to
deal
with
that.
in
this
case,
however,
it
is
undisputed
there
was
a
valid
regulatory
purpose,
and
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
do
not--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--but
even
in
that--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--no,
with
respect,
if
one
looks
at
a
cash-on-the-barrelhead
system,
the
way
the
fcc
auctions
work,
and
our
clients
are
deeply
involved
in
them,
one
does
not
get
the
license
right
after
becoming
the
high
bidder.
there
is
a
period
of
time
in
which
the
fcc
has
to
look
at
various
factors
and
people
have
the
right
to
file
petitions
to
deny.
under
nextwave's
interpretation
of
section
525,
which
prohibits
an
agency
from
denying
a
license
to
anyone
for
failing
to
pay
a
dischargeable
debt,
under
their
interpretation
the
fcc
would
be
required
to
grant
a
license
to
somebody
who
has
been
declared
the
high
bidder
and
then
declares
bankruptcy
the
next
day.
what
nextwave
is
doing
here
is
truly
gaming
the
system.
they
are
saying,
it's
a
heads
i
win,
tails
you
lose
scenario.
we
can
go
into
bankruptcy,
we
get
the
license
because
we
promised
that
we
would
pay
more
than
anybody
else
would--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--you
make
a
down
payment,
and
nextwave
made
their
down
payment.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
even
on
a
cash-on-the-barrelhead
system
the
fcc
does
not
require
full
payment,
it
can't
require
full
payment
until
they
actually
grant
the
license,
and
that
is
a
several-month
lag
between
the
time
when
you're
declared
the
high
bidder...
in
one
case,
in
my
client's
case
it
was
more
than
a
year
after
they
were
declared
the
high
bidder
for
licenses,
and
they
actually
received
them,
because
of
proceedings
that
were
filed.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i
don't
think
that
the
fcc
has
deference
in
interpreting
the
bankruptcy
code,
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
whether
one
policy
outweighs
the
other.
i
think--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
our
rationale--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--our
rationale
is
that
they
can
be
harmonized,
and
should
be
harmonized.
for
example,
the
exception,
the
regulatory
exception
to
the
automatic--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
the
exact
rationale,
but
we
think
that
the
policies
can
be
harmonized
and
should
be
harmonized.
