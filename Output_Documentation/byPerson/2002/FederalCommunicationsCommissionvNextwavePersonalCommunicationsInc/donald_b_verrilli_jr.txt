mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
record
is
clear
that
the
fcc
revoked
nextwave's
licenses
solely
because
nextwave
deferred
a
payment
to
the
fcc
while
reorganizing
in
bankruptcy.
two
and
a
half
years
ago
the
fcc
blocked
nextwave's
bankruptcy
reorganization,
and
it
did
so
by
announcing
that
nextwave's
licenses
had
automatically
canceled
because
nextwave
had
deferred
a
loan
payment
to
the
fcc
in
1998.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
because
nextwave--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
did
not
make
it,
yes.
it
did
not
make
it.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
did
not
make
it--
[laughter]
--in
1998.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
we
were
reorganizing
in
bankruptcy--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
we
did
not
pay
because
we
were
reorganizing,
that's
right.
now,
throughout
the
proceedings
in
this
case
the
fcc
has
never
identified
a
ground,
other
than
that
single
nonpayment,
that
would
support
revocation
of
the
licenses,
and
that's
because
there
isn't
one.
what
the
fcc
has
done
instead,
and
what
it's
done
here
this
morning,
is
to
instead
suggest
that
section
525
of
the
bankruptcy
code
ought
not
apply
because
the
fcc
had
a
regulatory
or
public
interest
purpose
for
making
a
nonpayment
an
automatic
sole
trigger
for
revocation
of
a
license,
but
in
passing
the
bankruptcy
code,
congress
already
weighed
the
public
interests,
and
section
525
of
the
code
is
a
clear
expression
of
congress's
judgment
about
where
the
public
interest
lies.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
the
record
utterly
and
completely
refutes
that
proposition,
and
it
does
so
in
the
following
ways.
the
regulation
that
they
cite,
which
is
1.2110
of
their
rules,
and
it's
at
page
495
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
says
that
the
licenses
cancel
automatically
upon
nonpayment.
the
face
of
the
license
says
that
the
licenses
cancel
automatically
upon
nonpayment
and
for
no
other
reason.
the
announcement
of
the
license
cancellation
in
this
case
in
january
2000
said
that
the
licenses
canceled
automatically
for
nonpayment
and
no
other
reason.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
restructuring
orders
they
did
do
that,
but
that
doesn't
make
the
revocation
any
less
automatic.
all
it
did
was
move
the
date
back
in
a
legislative,
quasi-legislative
rulemaking,
move
the
date
from
when
it
would
initially
have
occurred
to
a
later
time.
when--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
date
was
suspended
by
the
fcc
well
in
advance.
the
payment
date
was
suspended
well
in
advance
of
its
occurrence,
so
a
payment
date
never
came
and
went
without
nextwave
or
any
other
licensee
failing
to
make
a
payment.
all
that
happened
here
was
that
in
advance
of
the
payment
date,
the
fcc
moved
the
payment
date,
but
when
it
did
so,
it
reaffirmed--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
this
was
suspended
in
advance
of
the
due
date
for
the
first
payment.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
is
right,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
it
does,
and
it's
already
been
taken
care
of,
in
fact.
the
question
under
the
avoidance
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code
is
when
the
debtor's
obligation
becomes
due,
and
the
issue
here
was
whether
the
obligation
became
due
on
the
date
of
the
auction
or,
instead,
later,
at
the
time
the
licenses
were
awarded.
now,
that
is
a
matter
entirely
within
the
control
of
the
fcc.
all
they
have
to
do
is
make
clear
in
their
regulations
when
the
obligation
attaches.
the
reason
that
there
was
a
problem
here
was
that
the
regulations
suggested
that
the
obligation
attached
later
and,
therefore,
if
the
value
of
the
asset
declined
from
the
time
of
the
initial
auction
to
the
time
of
the
license
award,
section
544
would
apply.
but
the
fcc
has
changed
its
regulations,
and
at
this
point
it
is
unambiguous
that
the
obligation
attaches
at
the
time
of
the
auction--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
therefore
544
can't
operate.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
it
did.
it's
just
a
nonissue.
it's
just...
that
issue
is
just
a
nonissue,
and
in
any
event
it
isn't...
the
question
really
here
is
whether
the
fcc,
when
it
effectively
acts
as
a
lender,
is
going
to
be
treated
any
differently
than
a
private
company
when
it
acts
as
a
lender.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
my
response
is
the
following,
justice
breyer.
first,
the
text
of
525
is
unambiguous.
it
applies
to
someone
who
is
or
was
a
debtor,
and
it
applies
to
debts
that
are
dischargeable,
as
well
as
those
that
have
been
discharged
and,
therefore,
it
is
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
it
applies
and
protects
companies
while
they
are
reorganizing
and
before
the
debts
are
discharged,
so
i
think
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that's...
it's
not
correct.
it's
not
the
right
reading
of
the
statute.
and
in
terms
of
what
it
does
in
operation,
it's
this.
now,
if...
if
this
had
been
a
situation
where
the
fcc
had
demanded
cash
on
the
barrelhead
up
front,
and
nextwave
had
gone
and
bid
and
gone
out
and
borrowed
that
money
from
a
bank,
and
had
to
pay
the
bank
over
time,
and
then
filed
for
bankruptcy,
there
would
be
no
question
that
that,
that
the
debt
to
the
bank
could
be
reorganized
and
disposed
of
in
the
normal
manner
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
a--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
if
we...
well,
i
think
that
that
point
is
exactly
right,
justice
scalia,
that
the
government's
regulatory
purpose
argument,
if
accepted,
would
give
them
the
authority
to
revoke
licenses
not
only
when
the
payment
was
not
made
to
the
government,
but
not
made
to
private
parties.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
it--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--two
points.
first,
the
government
can
collect
its
interest
as
a
secured
creditor
in
exactly
the
same
way
a
private
lender
could
through
the
bankruptcy
system.
it
has
enormous
protections
through
the
bankruptcy
system
as
a
secured
creditor.
it
gets,
it's
100
percent
entitled
under
the
bankruptcy
code
to
the
full
value
of
the
licenses,
and
it
has
numerous
other
protections
under
the
code.
it
can
make
an
election
under--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--you
can't...
the
fcc,
like
a
private
lender,
can't
foreclose
on
the
lien.
it
has
to...
its
debt
has
to
be
processed
through
the
bankruptcy
system.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
right.
they
can't...
under
the
bankruptcy
code
they
can't
take
back
the
license.
they
can
get
their
secured
claim
paid
to
the
same
extent
that
a
private
lender
could,
but
they
can't--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
they
can,
and...
but
just
as--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--the
transfer
would,
to
somebody
else
would
need
approval
from
the
fcc,
but
the
key
point
here
is
that
section
525--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
it
is
different
from
a
cancelation,
and
the
key
point
here
i
think,
justice
breyer,
in
answer
to
your
question
ultimately,
is
that
525
is
in
the
bankruptcy
code
to
protect
the
right
to
reorganize.
what
it
says
is
that
those
who
hold
government
licenses
cannot
be
denied
the
ability
to
invoke
the
bankruptcy
process
and
reorganize
solely
because
they
do
what
the
bankruptcy
code
allows
them
to
do.
without
this
protection,
licensing
agencies
would
have
the
ability
to
force
insolvent
debtors
to
liquidate,
because
it
would
have
the
power
to
revoke
their
permission
to
do
business
solely
because
they
hadn't
paid
a
debt,
or
solely
because
even
they
were
in
bankruptcy,
and
that
would--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
it
can.
it
can
give
it
as
a...
it
can...
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
there
are
some
restrictions
on
it,
but
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
it
can.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
the
question
of
whether
this
was,
in
fact,
an
automatic
revocation,
and
the
reconsideration
order,
which
is
the
order
under
review
here,
is
the
order
in
which
the
fcc
says
principally
that
it
departed
from
the
automatic
character
of
the
revocation,
but
that
reconsideration
order
says
no
fewer
than
14
times
by
my
count
that
the
revocation
was
automatic,
and
there's
one
statement
in
that
in
particular
which
i
think
should
put
to
rest
as
a
factual
matter
the
question
of
whether
this
was
anything
other
than
an
automatic
cancelation,
and
that's
at
page
74a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
and
it's
right
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
before
the
footnote.
and
the
fcc
says
in
the
reconsideration
order,
thus,
the
only
way
that
nextwave
could
have
avoided
the
loss
of
its
licenses,
even
under
the
rule
interpretation
it
urges,
was
to
have
avoided
default
by
making
full
and
timely
payment
on
or
before
the
payment
due
date.
if
the
only
way
that
nextwave
could
have
avoided
default
was
by
making
the
payment,
then
there
is
nothing
else
that
could
have
been
shown,
and
nothing
else
that
could
have
happened
in
the
reconsideration
process
or
any
waiver
process,
that
would
have
provided
an
additional
ground
for
revocation.
and
if
i
could
also
point
the
court
to
a
statement
on
the
prior
page,
page
73a:
for
all
these
reasons
we
reject
nextwave's
interpretation
of
our
default
and
cancellation
rules
and
reaffirm
that
the
failure
to
make
full
payment
in
a
timely
manner,
following
exhaustion
of
all
applicable
grace
periods,
constitutes
a
default
and
results
in
the
automatic
cancellation
of
the
license
without
further
commission
action.
their
theory
is
that
this
happens
by
operation
of
law
on
the
day
after
nonpayment.
it
is
as
automatic
as
anything
can
be,
and
nothing
about
the
reconsideration
process,
and
nothing
about
their
waiver
authority
changes
that
one
iota.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
but
they
said
in
the
reconsideration
order
that
they
were
not
going
to
do
that,
ever,
because
it
was
an
automatic
cancellation.
they
also
said
in
the
restructuring
orders,
justice
ginsburg,
that
you
referred
to
earlier,
in
each
of
the
restructuring
orders
they
said
they
would
not
grant
a
waiver
of
the
payment
deadline
under
any
circumstances,
and
then
when
individual
licensees
sought
waivers,
the
fcc
rejected
the
waiver
requests,
and
it
cited
back
to
those
provisions
in
the
restructuring
order
saying,
we
told
you
this
was
an
automatic
rule,
and
we
reject
your
request,
and
it
did
so
even
in
instances,
in
two
cases
where
the
licensees
were
providing
service.
and
so
there's
just
no
question
that
this
was
an
automatic
cancelation
rule
and
therefore
precisely
at
the
core
of
what
section
525
forbids
the
fcc
or
any
other
licensing
agencies
from
doing.
if
i
may,
i
want
to
turn
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
any
conflict
between
the
fcc's
exercise
of
its
authority
under
section
309(j)
and
the
bankruptcy
code.
the
answer
is,
as
a
statutory
matter
there
is
no
conflict,
because
the
fcc
was
not
required
to
have
an
installment
payment
plan,
and
even
if
it
were
required
to
have
one
there
wouldn't
be
a
conflict
because
congress
didn't
say
that
the
fcc
had
to
make
license
revocation
automatic
upon
nonpayment.
so
the
fcc's
argument
really
is
an
implied
repeal
argument
here,
that
309(j)
implicitly
repeals
525
in
some
applications,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
and
the
authority
is
exactly
contrary
to
the
position
that
the
fcc
deserves
deference.
the
fcc
deserves
deference
only
with
respect
to
interpretation
of
its
own
statute,
not
with
respect
to
the
bankruptcy
code.
so
the
answer
is
clearly
that
they
don't
get
any
deference,
and...
but
there
isn't
any
conflict.
all
there
is
is
the
fcc...
there
isn't
any
statutory
conflict.
all
there
is,
the
only
conflict
arises
from
the
fcc's
desire
to
make
this
an
automatic
cancelation
rule,
and
the
conflict
is
between
an
fcc
policy
choice
and
a
directive
from
congress.
when
the
conflict
is
at
that
level,
there's
no
doubt
about
what
the
answer
is,
which
is
that
the
directive
from
congress
prevails.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
because
what
525
forbids
are
the
grounds
on
which
the
license
is
revoked,
so
if
the
license
is
revoked
solely
because
of
nonpayment
of
dischargeable
debt,
then
whether
there's
a
rule
or
not--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
that
would
violate
525,
but
for
a
different
reason.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
it's
this.
525
doesn't
merely
forbid
revocation
for
nonpayment.
it
forbids
discrimination,
and
it
forbids
imposing
conditions
solely
because
of
nonpayment,
solely
because
of
being
in
bankruptcy,
so--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
it
does
have
several
functions.
for
example,
your
honor,
the
fcc
has
a
build-out
rule
for
these
licenses,
says
you
have
to
build
them
out
within
5
years,
and
to
serve,
a
requirement
that
we
were
in
compliance
with,
by
the
way.
but
if
we
hadn't
been
in
compliance
with
them
and
the
fcc
had
moved
to
revoke
the
licenses
because
we
weren't
in
compliance
with
the
build-out
rule,
and
we
had
said,
well,
the
reason
we
are
not
in
compliance
with
the
build-out
rule
is
that
we're
in
bankruptcy
and
we
can't
pay
the
vendors
to
build
it
out,
that
would
be
a
situation
in
which
the
fcc
could
enforce
its
rule,
even
though
at
some
level
it
is
because
we
were
in
bankruptcy.
it's
just
not
"solely"
because.
it's
because
we
violated
a
neutral
rule
that
was
not
focused
solely
on
nonpayment.
and
i
think
there
would
be
other
circumstances
in
which
the
fact
of
nonpayment
could
be
a
consideration
in
a
broader
or
a
different...
in
a
broader
or
different
set
of
circumstances.
but
when
you
have
what
you
have
here,
is
where
it
is
the
only
consideration,
the
only
factor,
the
determinative
consideration,
that
is
the
paradigm
case
of
violation
of
525.
what
the
fcc
has
done,
it's--
