justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clement,
suppose...
and
i
consider
this
a
classic
case
for
what
this
provision
of
the
bankruptcy
code
was
directed
to.
suppose
you
have
a
state
law
that
says
anyone
who
is
in
default
of
traffic
tickets
that
amount
to
more
than
$500
shall
have
his
license
revoked,
okay,
and
the
person
in
question
goes
into
bankruptcy,
doesn't
pay
the
$500,
gets
the
$500
discharged
in
bankruptcy,
the
state
you
think
can
revoke
his
license?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
isn't
there
a
regulatory
purpose
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
always
find
a
regulatory
purpose.
i
mean,
it's
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
always
such
a
mechanism
whenever
you
have
a
debtor
and
a
creditor.
the
creditor
can
always
extend
the
payment.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
need
some
special
power
from
the
state
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
just
making
up
a
regulatory
purpose,
as
a
regulator.
i
mean,
as
a
regulator,
as
a
creditor
you
can
always
say
it's
being
done
as
a
regulator,
always.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think...
so
it
is
really
a
legal
issue,
whether
you
have
that
discretion
or
not?
i
mean,
there
are
people
who
say
you
don't
have
that
discretion.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
we
have
to
decide
that
in
this
case?
i
didn't
realize
that
was
one
of
the
issues
presented.
that
may
be
a
more
important
issue
than
the,
you
know,
few
billion
dollars
involved
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
might
not
be
here,
but
i
mean,
we're
just
assuming
that
it
had
that.
the
case
is
here.
that
is
not
one
of
the
questions
presented.
i
frankly
don't
want
to
decide
that
question,
because
that
is
not
one
of
the
things
i've
given
a
lot
of
attention
to.
it
sounds
to
me
very,
you
know,
at
least
quite
arguable
whether
they
ought
to
have
that
authority.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
it's
not
in
dispute,
which
means
we
don't
have
to
decide
it.
it's
not
presented
in
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
have
to
look
at
the
reasons?
i
mean,
that's
what
troubles
me.
the
language
of
the
statute
simply
says
that
a
governmental
unit
may
not
revoke
a
charter,
franchise,
or
other
similar
grant,
okay...
it
goes
on,
solely
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--such
person
is
or
has
been
a
debtor,
blah,
blah,
or
hasn't
made
a
payment.
solely
because.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
let's
assume
that
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
makes
discrimination
because
of,
or
failure
to
hire
someone,
or
let's
say,
let's
say
killing
someone
solely
because
of
his
race--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
crime,
a
separate
crime.
and
someone,
let's
assume
he
kills
someone
who
is
jewish,
and
he
said,
well,
i
didn't
kill
him
solely
because
he
was
jewish;
i
killed
him
because
i
disagree
with
the
policies
of
israel.
does
that
get
him
out
of
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
made
it
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
getting
to
the
question
of
whether
the
fact
that
you
have
some
other
motive--
justice
antonin
scalia
--eliminates
the
sole
causality.
the
only
reason
this
person
was
killed
was
because
he
was
jewish,
and
so
also
here,
the
only
reason
this
license
was
terminated
is
because
the
person
hadn't
paid.
now,
there
may
be
some
regulatory
motive
in
the
background,
just
as
in
the
hypothetical
that
i
invented
there
was
some
international
political
motive
in
the
background,
but
that
doesn't
alter
the
fact
that
the
person
was
killed
solely
because
he
was
jewish,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
license
here
was
revoked
solely
because
the
payment
hadn't
been
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
the
statute
doesn't
cover
anything,
because
every
regulatory
body
that
cancels
a
license,
whenever
there's
a
license
involved,
you
can
say
that
there
is
some
regulatory
motive,
as
in
the
hypothetical
that
i
gave
to
mr.
clement.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
motor
vehicle
cancellation.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
nothing
in
the
federal
communications
act
requires
the
federal
communications
commission
to
stand
as
the
guarantor,
you
know,
to
hold
the
bag
for
the
person
that
they're
giving
away
this
multibillion-dollar
license
to.
they
could
require
cash
on
the
barrelhead,
couldn't
they?
and
let
the
person
who
wants
the
license
get
a
loan
from
some
bank,
let
them
be
stuck
holding
the
bag.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there's
no
regulatory
necessity
for
this
whole
tragedy,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
had
deferred
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean,
failed
to
make
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
we
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
might
have
been
some
legal
mumbo-jumbo
that
had
caused
the
payment
not
to
be
due.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
didn't
pay
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
say
it's
not
automatic.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
had
not
been
a
failure
to
make
an
earlier
payment?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
i
think
if
you
accept
the
fcc's
argument
here,
they
would
say
we
have
a
regulatory
purpose,
because
we
want
it...
we
want
these
licenses
to
be
given
to
people
who
have
the
financial
responsibility
to
operate
the
radio
stations
and
so
forth.
the
arguments
they
made
would
continue
to
apply
to
that
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
wouldn't
say
there's
no
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
if
we
accept
their
argument
here,
we
would
probably
have
to
accept
it
in
the
other
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
take
the
license
back
if
they
cause
the
debtor
to
have
to
sell
the
license
and
to
take
the
money
from
the
sale
of
the
license
and
give
it
to
the
fcc.
isn't
that
what's
going
on?
that's
different
from
a
cancellation
of
the
license.
the
license
subsists,
and
the
debtor
can
sell
it
to
somebody
else,
or
the
bankruptcy
court
on
behalf
of
the
debtor
can
sell
it
to
somebody
else,
is
that
right?
does
that
need
approval
from
the
fcc?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
different
from
a
cancellation,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
just
simply
changed
their
rules
to
say
the
fcc
"may"
cancel
the
license
in
the
event
of
the
nonpayment
of
any
installment,
that
would
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it
isn't
solely
because
of
that.
that
is
a
necessary
but
not
a
sufficient
condition.
the
fcc
would
be
saying,
we
will
consider
the
regulatory
situation.
if
you
fail
to
make
a
payment,
you
are
revocable,
but
we
won't
revoke
necessarily.
it
depends
upon
the
regulatory
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
binding
on
us,
certainly?
justice
antonin
scalia
these
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
federal
communications
commission
awarded
spectrum
licenses
to
nextwave
personal
communications
and
allowed
nextwave
to
pay
for
these
licenses
in
installments.
the
company
subsequently
filed
for
chapter
11
bankruptcy
and
suspended
payments
to
all
creditors
including
the
fcc.
its
plan
of
reorganization
envisioned
repayment
of
its
obligations
to
the
fcc
but
the
fcc
objected
to
the
plan
asserting
that
nextwave's
licenses
had
been
cancelled
automatically
when
the
company
missed
its
payment
deadline.
nextwave
filed
a
petition
with
the
fcc
seeking
reconsideration
of
the
license
cancellation
and
upon
denial
appealed
to
the
d.c.
circuit
asserting
that
the
cancellation
violated
the
bankruptcy
act
and
thus
should
be
set
aside
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed,
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm.
the
administrative
procedure
act
requires
federal
courts
to
set
aside
federal
agency
action
that
is
not
in
accordance
with
law.
the
question
before
us
is
whether
the
fccs
cancellation
violated
section
525
of
the
bankruptcy
act
which
provides
in
relevant
part
that
“a
governmental
unit
may
not
revoke
a
license
to
person
that
is
a
debtor
under
this
title,
solely
because
such
debtor
has
not
paid
a
debt
that
is
dischargeable”
in
bankruptcy.
here
the
proximate
cause
for
the
fcc’s
revocation
of
the
licenses
was
not
nextwave’s
failure
to
make
the
payments
that
were
due.
that
suffices
to
invoke
section
525.
contrary
to
petitioner’s
contention,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
agency
has
some
regulatory
motive
behind
its
action
in
canceling
for
nonpayment.
when
the
statute
refers
to
failure
to
pay
a
debt
as
the
sole
cause
of
cancellation,
it
cannot
reasonably
be
understood
to
include
among
the
other
causes
whose
presence
can
preclude
application
of
the
prohibition,
the
government
unit’s
motive
in
adopting
a
cancellation
for
nonpayment
rule
such
a
reading
would
deprive
section
525
of
all
force
since
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
situation
in
which
a
governmental
unit
would
not
have
some
further
motive
behind
the
rule.
petitioner’s
contend
that
nextwave’s
license
obligations
to
the
commission
are
not
“within
the
meaning
of
525
debts
that
are
dischargeable
in
bankruptcy"
because
they
function
as
regulatory
conditions.
we
disagree.
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
debt
is
defined
to
mean
liability
on
a
claim
and
claim
in
turn
is
defined
to
include
any
right
to
payment.
in
short,
a
debt
is
a
debt
even
when
the
obligation
to
pay
it
is
also
a
regulatory
condition.
petitioners
also
argued
that
respondent’s
obligations
are
not
dischargeable
in
bankruptcy
because
it
is
beyond
the
authority
of
bankruptcy
courts
to
alter
or
modify
regulatory
obligations.
dischargeability
however
is
not
tied
to
the
existence
of
such
authority.
a
preconfirmation
debt
is
dischargeable
unless
it
falls
within
an
expressed
exception.
artistically
symmetrical
with
petitioner’s
contention
that
the
bankruptcy
court
has
no
power
to
alter
regulatory
obligations
is
their
contention
that
the
d.c.
circuit
has
no
power
to
modify
or
discharge
a
debt.
just
as
the
former
is
irrelevant
to
whether
the
bankruptcy
court
can
discharge
a
debt,
so
also
the
latter
is
irrelevant
to
order
the
d.c.
circuit
can
set
aside
agency
action
that
violates
law.
the
court
did
not
seek
to
modify
or
discharge
the
debt
but
merely
prevented
the
fcc
from
violating
section
525.
finally
we
reject
the
contention
that
our
interpretation
of
section
525
creates
a
conflict
with
the
communications
act.
it
does
not
obstruct
the
functioning
of
the
spectrum
auction
provisions
since
nothing
in
those
provisions
demands
that
cancellation
be
the
sanction
for
failure
to
make
agreed
upon
periodic
payments.
indeed,
nothing
in
those
provisions
even
requires
the
commission
to
permit
payment
to
be
made
over
time.
what
petitioners
described
as
a
conflict
boils
down
to
nothing
more
than
a
policy
preference
on
the
fcc's
part
for
one,
selling
licenses
on
credit,
and
two,
canceling
licenses
rather
than
asserting
security
interests
in
licenses
when
there
is
a
default.
such
administrative
preferences
cannot
be
the
bases
for
denying
respondent
rights
provided
by
the
plain
terms
of
law.
while
the
fcc
retains
security
interest
in
these
cases,
it
did
not
seek
to
enforce
those
security
interests
but
opted
to
eliminate
the
licenses
to
the
forbidden
regulatory
step
of
revoking
them.
the
question
whether
section
525
would
also
prevent
the
government’s
enforcement
of
its
security
interests
is
neither
presented
nor
answered
today.
