well,
mr.
clement,
it
appears
to
me
that
the
fcc
went
along
with
the
bankruptcy
filing,
filed
a
claim
for
the
amount
that
wasn't
paid,
and
apparently
went
along
with
the
proposals
for
a
while
to
work
this
out
and
then,
very
shortly
before
the
decision
to
reauction
the
things,
the
fcc
decided
not
to
go
along
with
it.
that
doesn't
sound
like
some
automatic
cancellation.
i
mean,
the
fcc
appeared
to
treat
it
very
much
like
the
bankruptcy
claim
for
quite
some
time,
didn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
clement,
the
respondent
also
makes
a
right-to-cure
argument
under
the
bankruptcy
law,
and
you
haven't
addressed
that,
i
take
it,
in
your
briefs,
anyway.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
verrilli,
let
me
ask
you
about
something
else.
the
bankruptcy
court,
as
i
understand
it,
ordered
a
$3.7
billion
reduction
in
the
purchase
price
on
constructive
broad
grounds,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
we
were
to
affirm
here,
does
the
fcc
have
any
power
to
prevent
a
bankruptcy
court
from
reducing
the
price
in
that
fashion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
very
strange.
