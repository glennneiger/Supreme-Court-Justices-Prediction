mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
has
directed
the
fcc
to
use
auctions
to
allocate
scarce
wireless
spectrum
in
a
manner
that
furthers
the
public
interest.
those
auctions
allocate
spectrum
to
the
party
who
will...
who
values
the
spectrum
most
highly
and,
by
assumption,
will
use
it
most
effectively
to
serve
the
public.
in
addition,
congress
has
directed
the
fcc
to
consider
a
number
of
specific
factors
in
assessing
the
public
interest,
including
promoting
opportunities
for
small
business
and
ensuring
the
rapid
deployment
of
wireless
services.
nothing
in
that
public
interest
regulatory
regime
runs
afoul
of
section
525
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
to
be
sure,
in
administering
its
auctions
the
fcc
does
place
consequences
on
the
regulatory
signals
provided
by
the
failure
to
meet
regulatory
payment
deadlines.
in
particular,
the
fcc
views
the
failure
to
make
a
timely
regulatory
payment
as
a
proxy
for
a
determination
that
continued
possession
of
the
license
is
not
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right.
it's
been
replaced
in
large
part
but
not
exclusively,
and
i
think
both
aspects
that
are
important--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
there's
a
difference,
though,
when
a
regulator
regulates
solely
for
timely
payment
for
its
own
sake,
and
in
that
case
it
implicates
only
the
policies
that
are
addressed
by
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
i
think
it's
a
different
situation
when
the
regulator
looks
at
the
failure
to
make
timely
payment
as
a
proxy
for
something
else.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it's
automatic
in
the
sense--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
justice,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
when
it
says
automatic,
what
it
means
is
that
it
cancels
without
any,
the
need
for
any
further
action
from
the
commission,
but
in
any
given
case,
the
cancellation
of
a
license
is
a
result
both
of
the
automatic
cancellation
rule
and
the
fact
that
a
payment
deadline
has
come
forward,
and
where
the
commission
has
discretion
is
in
relaxing
the
payment
deadline,
and
you
can
see
that
in
this
very
case.
nextwave's
license
is
canceled,
according
to
the
fcc,
because
nextwave
failed
to
make
the
very
first
installment
payment
due
under
those
licenses.
now,
according
to
the
licenses
in
the
first
instance,
that
payment
was
due
on
april
30,
1997,
but
the
licenses
didn't
cancel
on
april
30,
1997
because
the
commission
in
its
discretion,
as
part
of
a
multifactor
public
interest
determination,
extended
the
payment
deadline
a
full
18
months.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
to
be
sure,
the
fcc
participated
in
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
protected
its
interests
as
a
creditor,
but
at
the
same
time
it
has
independent
interests
as
a
regulator,
and
the
fcc,
as
we
point
out
on
page
19
of
the
reply
brief,
made
clear
at
various
points
well
before
nextwave
went
into
bankruptcy
that
it
did
not
view
bankruptcy
as
an
exception
from
the
regulatory
provisions
of
the
communications
act,
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
specific
event
that
nextwave
points
to
as
the
automatic
cancellation,
it's
the
failure
to
make
a
payment
that
was
due
on
october
29,
1998,
and
it
was
due
on
the
29th
of
october,
1998,
rather
than
april
30,
1997,
precisely
because
of
a
public
interest
determination
by
the
commission.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
when...
i
mean,
it
is
true
that
the
fcc
tried
to
go
in
and
protect
its
interests
as
a
creditor,
but
at
the
point
that
nextwave
was
trying
to
keep
its
regulatory
licenses
that
it
promised
to
pay
$4.7
billion
for,
and
trying
to
keep
those
licenses
for
just
over
a
billion,
the
result
of
that
process
would
have
been
that
the
rest
of
that
amount,
the
$3
billion
plus,
would
have
been
an
unsecured
claim
of
the
fcc,
that
would
have
been
really
worth
virtually
nothing,
so
i
think
the
better
way
to
understand
this
case
is
that
the
fcc
does
have
interests
as
a
creditor,
and
it
has
tried
to
protect
those
interests
in
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
has
participated
in
those
proceedings,
but
at
the
same
time,
it
has
interests
with
the...
as
a
regulator,
and
in
its
capacity
as
a
regulator
it
hasn't
acted
in
a
way
that
would
result
in
a
sole-cause
cancellation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
don't,
but
let
me
give
you--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no.
the
only
regulatory
purpose
there,
at
least
as
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
is
in
providing
for
timely
payment,
but
suppose
a
state--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
again,
but
if
a
state
had
a
regulatory
purpose
in
ensuring
that
its
drivers
were
financially
responsible,
and
presumptively
said
that
a
license
would
fail
to
cancel
for
the
failure
to
pay
$500
in
traffic
tickets,
but
provided
a
mechanism
for
the
driver
to
go
in
before
the
regulatory
commission
and
say,
look,
i
know
i
haven't
paid
$500
worth
of
traffic
tickets,
but
i'm
actually
financially
responsible.
i
have
a
ton
of
money
in
the
bank,
and
so
you
ought
to
give
me
a
relaxation
of
the
rules
or
a
waiver--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right,
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
but
again,
if
you
look,
and
what
the
regulator
is
doing
is
extending
the...
extending
the
payment
not
as
a
creditor,
but
as
a
regulator,
i
think
you're
in
a
very
different
situation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
really
don't
think
that's
true,
with
respect.
i
think
the
kind
of
waiver
proceeding
or
opportunity
to
relax
the
rules
would
be
out
of
place
in
a
regulatory
regime
that
was
only
concerned
with
timely
payment.
it's
precisely
because
the
fcc
uses
the
timely
payment,
or
the
failure
to
make
timely
payment,
as
a
proxy
for
a
public
interest
determination
that
it
has
this
waiver
proceeding,
and
it
gives
the
regulating
entity--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
mean,
there
is
some
tension
there,
and
the
fcc
has
been
at
pains
to
try
to
make
sure
that
it
doesn't
bend
over
one
way
too
far
or
the
other.
in
its
restructuring
order
that
i
think
is
critical
in
this
case.
it
froze
the
payments...
it
suspended
the
payments
ultimately
for
18
months,
and
then
it
also
provided
some
restructuring
options
that
required
further
modifications
of
its
rules.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
when
it
did
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--when
it
did
that,
not
only
did
some
people
complain
that
they
didn't
give
enough
regulatory
relief,
but
other
disappointed
bidders
ran
to
the
d.c.
circuit
and
said,
look,
you've
acted
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
because
you
haven't
stuck
with
your
pre-auction
rules.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
again
i
think
the
key
is,
the
payments
do
cancel
automatically
after
all
the
efforts
to
get
the
payments
extended
have
failed,
and
that's
just
not
like
a
hypothetical
consideration
in
this
case,
because
in
this
very
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
no,
not
after
attempts
to--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
automatic
trigger
is
when
somebody
fails
to
make
a
payment--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and...
no,
it's
really
not
enough,
if
you
look
at
the
broader
perspective
of
the
regulation,
because
there's
an
alternative
way
to
get
out
of
the
automatic
cancellation.
it's
not...
if
you're
a
regulated
entity
and
you
don't
want
your
license
to
cancel,
you
don't
go
to
the
commission
and
say,
don't
apply
the
automatic
cancellation.
what
you
do
is,
you
go
to
the
commission
and
you
say,
i've
a
regulatory
payment.
it's
going
to
be
due
april
30.
i'm
not
in
a
good
position
to
make
that
payment,
so
what
i'd
like
you
to
do
is
relax
the
payment
deadline,
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--not
only
does
the
commission
have
the
authority
to
do
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
did
it
in
this
very
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
the
reason
we
don't
settle
the
case
today,
although
obviously
there
were
efforts
to
try
to
settle
this,
which
would
require
congressional
legislation,
which
we
were
unable
to
get
in
a
timely
fashion,
but
the
reason
that
they
are
not
in
a
position
to
cure
their
defaults,
if
you
will,
is
because
our
view
is
that
they
have...
the
opportunity
to
cure
has
passed.
the
licenses
have
actually
already--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
it
would
be
within
the
agency's
discretion
to
settle
the
litigation
at
this
point.
now,
of
course,
if
we
did
that,
i'm
sure,
as
in
the
last
time
the
commission
tried
to
relax
its
rules,
i'm
sure
we'd
draw
a
d.c.
circuit
challenge
to
that
exercise
of
discretion
to
relax
the
rules.
but
the
very
fact
that
there
is
that
reservoir
of
discretion
to
relax
the
rules
demonstrates
that
the
ultimate
cancellation
is
not
a
sole-cause
cancellation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
i
don't
think...
whether
or
not
the
fcc
has
the
authority
to
exercise
that
discretion
in
a
particular
case
might
be
an
issue,
but
it's
undisputed
that
they
have
that
right
as
a
general
matter
and,
in
fact,
nextwave
wouldn't
be
here
today
if
the
fcc
didn't
have
the
authority
to
offer
discretionary
relaxation
of
its
rules.
when
nextwave's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
really
think
it's
in
dispute,
because
in
this
very
case
the
payment
deadline--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no.
we
think
the
right-to-cure
argument
is
best
addressed
on
remand.
i
do
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
right
to
cure
is
not
any
longer
available
to
nextwave.
one
is
that
the
licenses
automatically
canceled
on
their
own
terms.
the
second
reason
is
that
the
license
restriction,
the
licenses
themselves
had
a
restriction
on
transfer
or
alienation,
and
there's
law
under
11
u.s.c.
365
that
deals
with
executory
obligations
that
says
that
the
debtor
in
possession
cannot
take
possession
of
a
license,
assume
the
obligations
of
a
license
if
there
are
restrictions
on
its
alienation
or
transfer.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
there
have
been
situations
like
that,
not
necessarily
in
the
c-block
license
situation,
but
there
was
a
situation
with
respect
to
a
different
program
where
a
license
canceled
by
its
own
terms
by
a
failure
to
renew,
and
the
commission
renewed
that
license
largely
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
that
licensee
was
already
providing
service,
and
so
the
result
of
revoking
the
license
would
be
to
deny
people
service
that
was
currently
being
provided.
now,
in
the
reconsideration
order
that's
the
subject--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
that
particular
instance
is
particularly
relevant,
because
nextwave
relied
on
that
in
its
reconsideration
proceedings
before
the
commission.
and
the
commission,
in
rejecting
that,
i
think
demonstrated
why
this
isn't
a
case
of
sole-cause
cancellation.
if
you
look
at
the
commission's
reasoning
on
page
82a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
commission
says,
quote,
"nextwave
is
providing
no
service.
"
"the
spectrum
licensed
to
nextwave
has
gone
unused
since
early
1997,
and
represents
licenses
in
90
markets
across
the
united
states.
"
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely,
it
does,
and
what
the
commission
decided
in
this
order,
which
is
under
review
in
this
case,
is
that
it
was
not
going
to
relax
or
provide
an
exception
to
the
automatic
cancellation
rule,
but
the
reason
it
decided
that
is
because
nextwave
wasn't
providing
service,
and
that
others
stood
ready
to
provide
service
under
that
spectrum,
and
what
i
would
respectfully
suggest
is
that
under
those
circumstances
the
cancellation
is
not
a
sole-cause
cancellation.
it
also
reflects
the
fact
that
nextwave
wasn't
providing
service,
that
others
stood
ready
to
do
it,
and
that's
enough
to
take
it
out
of
525,
which
is,
after
all,
a
very
narrowly
written
provision.
it
only
protects
against
sole
cancellation.
it
allows
the
failure
to
pay
a
dischargeable
debt
to
be
a
contributing
factor
in
a
regulatory
decision,
indeed,
the
primary
factor
in
the
regulatory
decision,
just
not
the
sole
cause.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
the
position
is
they
might
have
an
opportunity
to
go
after
that
as
an
unsecured
debt
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
true.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
an
open
question
before
the
commission
that
they
haven't
addressed.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
first
address
justice
o'connor's
very
proper
concern
that
licensees
are
going
to
be
able
to
enjoy
their
licenses
for
much
less
than
they
agreed
to
pay
the
commission.
that
is
not
a
dead
letter
and,
in
fact,
one
of
the
cases
that
is
being
held
for
this
case
involves
kansas
pcs,
where
the
bankruptcy
court
approved
the
plan
that
gave
the
fcc
5
cents
on
the
dollar
for
the
value
of
its
licenses.
now,
it's
true
that
one
mechanism
to
get
the
licenses
for
less
than
they
paid
for,
the
fraudulent
conveyance
theory,
is
something
that
the
fcc
can
address.
that
was
the
gwi
bankruptcy,
where
the
fcc
only
got
16
cents
on
the
dollar.
but
there's
a
second
way
to
do
it,
which
is
to
only
give
the
fcc
the
value
for
its
security
interest,
the
value
of
the
licenses
at
that
point,
and
the
bankruptcy
court
did
that
in
kansas
pcs,
and
only
gave
the
commission
5
cents
on
the
dollar.
second,
let
me
address
justice
kennedy's
concern
with,
where's
the
authority
for
the
fcc
to
take
into
account
bankruptcy
policy
concerns?
the
authority
comes
from
a
d.c.
circuit
decision
called
larose,
which
is
cited
on
page
79a
of
the
decision,
the
reconsideration
decision
that's
under
review.
the
larose
decision
is
a
d.c.
circuit
decision
that
tells
the
fcc
that
it
must
take
bankruptcy
policy
considerations
into
account.
now--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
it
is
binding
on
the
fcc,
though,
and
the
fcc
tried
to
do
its
best
to
take
bankruptcy
considerations
into
account.
now,
if
it
failed
to
do
it
properly--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
they
did.
they
did,
and
again
i
think
they...
one
of
the
reasons
they
took
bankruptcy
considerations
into
account
is
by
extending
payments
for
all
the
c-block
licensees
for
18
months.
but
if
you
think
the
problem
here
is
that
the
fcc
didn't
do
the
right
balancing
of
bankruptcy
policy
and
telecommunications
policy,
then
the
d.c.
circuit
or
this
case
could
reverse
for
an
arbitrary
capriciousness,
but
that's
not
the
role
of
525.
525
is
an
exceedingly
narrow
provision
that
simply
prevents
a
regulator
under
any
circumstances
from
canceling
a
license
solely
because,
and
here
it's
just
not
true
that
the
failure
to
make
a
payment
was
the
sole
trigger,
because
you
have
to
look
at
it
in
context,
and
what
triggered
default
is
the
failure
to
make
a
payment
of
a
payment
that
was
due
for
a
particular
reason.
now,
anybody
in...
any
fcc
licensee
could
have
gone
to
the
commission
and
tried
to
get
a
further
extension
of
that
payment
deadline.
they'd
already
gotten
extended
18
months.
they
could
have
gotten
extended
even
further,
and
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
how
there's
a
sole
trigger
when
the
very
payment
deadline
that
is
supposed
to
be...
trigger
the
automatic
cancelation
is
itself
the
reflection
of
a
multifactor
public
interest
determination
by
the
commission.
they
extended
it
18
months
but
no
further,
based
on
a
consideration
of
the
public
interest.
now,
on
justice
breyer's
concern
about
what's
going
on
here,
i
think
your
concern
is
exactly
right,
and
what
sense
does
it
make
from
a
bankruptcy
policy
to
disable
the
government
to
make
installment
payments?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think...
no,
i
think...
i
think--
[laughter]
i
think...
there's
two
reasons
we
didn't
argue
it.
one,
we
did...
there
is
that
flavor
in
the
brief,
but
the
other
reason
is,
you
at
one
point
said,
doesn't
the
commission
just
want
the
money?
that's
actually
not
true.
what
we
want
is,
we
want
the
licenses
back--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--don't
worry...
thank
you,
your
honor.
