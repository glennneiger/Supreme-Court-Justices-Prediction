justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
so.
but
could...
i'd
like
very
much
to
hear
your
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
was
it...
and
where
we
started
was
with
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy.
and
as
i
understand
where
they
were
driving,
there
is
a
statute,
and
the
statute
is
disc.
and
under
this
statute,
there's
either
some
language,
or
there's
some
history
anyway,
which
is
of
interest
to
me,
which
says
when
you
work
out
the
allocation
rules,
follow
section
881...
or
861.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
861,
which
is
for
allocation
of
all
kinds
of
things--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
puerto
rico,
to
abroad,
et
cetera.
so
now
we
look
to
861.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
lo
and
behold,
what
they
did
in
861,
after
disc
was
passed,
is
they
changed
the
861
rules,
and
in
those
changed
rules,
it
says
you're
going
to
allocate
everything
to
a
sic
category
called
transportation
services.
and
then
it
has
a
little
sentence
here.
the
taxpayer
may
not
subdivide
the
categories
in
this
list.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right?
so
that's
their
861
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what
legally
is
wrong
with
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--since
congress
told
them
to
use
861,
and
here
they're
using
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
in
respect
to
that,
for
you
to
win
on
that,
we'd
have
to
say
that
congress
intended
that
the
rules
be
different
for
disc's
than
for
puerto
rico,
for
europe,
for
saudi
arabia--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
everything.
or
we'd
have
to
say
that
we're
throwing
out
this
reg
for
everything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying
disc
has
to
be
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
what
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
that's
what
i
wanted
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's...
we
are.
i...
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
assume
the
example
was
identical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
will
take
your
words
that
you
have
just
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
will
ask
you
why
a
different
person
quoting
those
words
couldn't
make
the
identical
argument
in
respect
to
the
tremendous
tax
advantages
given
to
puerto
rico--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
in
respect
to
the
supreme
importance
of
having
allocation
between
europe
and
the
united
states
among
subsidiaries--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
principal
corporations
be
accurate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
that's
fine.
but
he
says
that...
and
what
you're
supposed
to
do
is
you're
supposed
to,
i
guess,
subtract
the
costs
which
are
allocated
to
the
items
of
gross
income
in
that
group.
is
that
what
you're
supposed
to
do?
you
take
the
gross
receipts
in
that
group--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you
subtract
the
costs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
now,
you
allocate
them
under
861.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
go
to
861--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
he
says,
now,
if
you
look
at
861,
and
try
to
allocate
according
to
861
to
the
group
that
they've
picked
out,
it's
seriously
nuts,
basically.
i
mean,
imagine
that
you
had
a
farmer
and
the
farmer
raised
roses,
and
he
had
some
fishes,
and...
and
what
he
has
is
he
does
research
on
fish
diseases.
and
he
says...
you'd
say,
well,
my
goodness,
you're
going
to
allocate
his
whole
laboratory
costs
which
does
nothing
but
fish
diseases
to
the
growing
of
roses
because
both
are
farming
or
fisheries.
now,
is
it...
something
like
that
is
really
out
of
whack,
it
makes
so
little
sense
that
that
isn't
a
reasonable
method
of
allocation
under
anybody's
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
so
why
is
it
reasonable
to
allocate
the
fish
disease
research
to
rose
culture?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he'll
grant
you
all
that.
he
grants
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he
says,
you
know,
sometimes
it
is
clear.
for
example,
it
is
clear
that
roses
don't
get
fish
diseases,
and
similarly,
he
says,
it
is
equally
clear
that...
i
don't
know
the
factual
details,
but
he
says
it's
equally
clear
that
a
727
research
is
not
as
vague
as
a...
is...
is
different
from
a
757.
just
the
same...
roses
and
fish
diseases.
and
he
says
where
it's
that
clear,
it's
not
reasonable
for
the
treasury
to
try
to
pretend
that
it's
vague
or
hard
to
allocate,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
the
statute
say
you
could
just
apply
it
across
the
board?
by...
the
statute
in
994
that
i
have
just
refers
to
50
percent
of
the
combined
taxable
income,
and
that
doesn't
define--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--26a,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
is
it
open
as
to...
suppose
the...
you
were
to
say
the
following.
where
a
taxpayer
can
show
that
a
particular
r&d
expense
can
be
definitely
allocated
to
some
item
or
class
of
gross
income,
other
than
the
disc
class
in
this
situation
or
whatever,
where
they
can
show
that,
then
the
commissioner
cannot
require
them
to
allocate
it
to
a
different
item.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
be
just
taking
the
words
of
the
statute.
now,
suppose
you
said
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
that's
what...
that's
what
i
find
difficult
to
reconcile
with
the
861...
861-8...
what
is
it
called?
it's
861-8--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--(3)--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--et
cetera...
sentence
which
says
but
you
have
to
use
two-digit
sic
categories
because
i
think
they're
so
broad,
those
categories,
that
it
should
be
possible,
like
my
fish
example,
to
find
instances
where
you
could.
and
why
aren't
they
in
that
category?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
includes,
by
the
way,
agriculture,
forestry,
and
fisheries.
that's
one
category.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
two-digit
sic?
is
that
still
with--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
if
we
thought
the
two-digit
was
a
little
bit
going
too
far,
would
that
throw
open
all
kinds
of
claims
on
the...
on
the...
from
all
kinds
of
people?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
degree
of
specificity...
well,
at
least
three-digit
would
separate
the
roses
from
the
fish.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
don't
have
to
consider
it.
all
we'd
have
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--at
some
point
they
certainly--
