justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
now
hear
argument
in
our
first
case,
number
1209,
the
boeing
company
against
the
united
states.
mr.
geller.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
can
i
ask
you
a
factual
question
that
will
help
me
understand?
does
the...
is
there
just
one
disc
involved
here,
or
do
you
have
several
discs
for
different
product
lines?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
what
difference
would
it
make
whether
it
was
the
747
program,
or
the
727
program
if
the
disc
sells
them
both
anyway?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
the
converse,
i
suppose
under
your
view,
all
of
the
r&d
would
go
to
the
domestic
corporation
because
it
all
takes
place
before
the
product
is
put
on
the
market.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
were
you
reading
from,
mr.
geller?
i'd
like
to
follow.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
were
you
reading
from?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
number
iv,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
on
that
point
doesn't
the
word
grouping,
the
last
word
in
subparagraph
(iv),
refer
to
the
three
choices
in
subparagraph
(vi)
of
the...
on...
on
page
32a?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true,
just
going
back
to
justice
o'connor's
thought,
that...
that
the
consequence...
the
government's
position
is
that
all
research
and
development
cost
gets
allocated
to
the
disc
when
you're
in
a
business
like
they
are?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i...
i
understand
the
distinction
between
capitalizing
it
and...
and
taking
it
in
the
current
year.
but
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
the...
the
net
result
of
the
government's
approach
is
that...
that
all
of
the...
all
of
the
research
and
development
expense
of
the
company
would
be
attributable
to
the
disc.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
can
i
go
back
for
just
a
second...
and
be
sure
i
understand
something
right...
to
the
fish/roses
hypothetical?
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
the
fishes...
the
research
on
the
fishes
would
be
charged
to
the
disc
only
if
fishes
and
roses
were
in
the
same
sic
grouping?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
so
if
they're
in
a
different
grouping,
then
the
rose
farmer
wouldn't
have
to
pay
for
the
fish
research.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
geller,
you
have
a
little
over
2
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
geller.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
first
case
is
01-1209
boeing
company
against
the
united
states.
in
1971
and
again
in
1984,
congress
enacted
statutes
that
provide
tax
incentives
for
american
manufacturers
to
increase
their
export
sales.
because
both
statutes
provide
for
a
lesser
tax
burden
on
qualifying
subsidiaries
that
handle
exports,
it
is
advantageous
for
the
parent
to
minimize
its
share
and
maximize
the
subsidiary
share
of
the
aggregate
income
produced
by
export
sales.
the
statutes,
however
contain
rather
complex
provisions
limiting
the
amount
of
the
aggregate
taxable
income
that
maybe
assigned
to
the
subsidiary.
this
case
involves
the
dispute
over
the
method
used
by
boeing
to
allocate
several
billion
dollars
of
research
and
development
cost
between
the
parent
and
its
export
subsidiaries.
the
rules
for
allocating
such
cost
are
not
set
forth
in
the
statutes
but
are
covered
by
treasury
department
regulations.
in
its
challenge
to
the
government's
computation
of
its
taxes
for
the
years
1979
through
1987,
boeing
contends
that
the
government
has
misinterpreted
one
regulation
and
improperly
relied
on
another.
the
district
court,
following
a
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit,
agreed
with
boeing,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict.
despite
the
fine
argument
advanced
by
counsel,
for
boeing
for
reason
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
that
is
joined
by
justice
scalia.
