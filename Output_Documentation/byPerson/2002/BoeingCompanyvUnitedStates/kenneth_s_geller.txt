mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
internal
revenue
code
generally
requires
every
corporation
to
pay
an
annual
tax
measured
by
its
entire
net
income,
but
congress
decided
30
years
ago
in
the
disc
and
fsc
statutes
that
it
wished
to
encourage
exports
by
giving
favorable
tax
treatment
to
the
portion
of
a
company's
net
income
that's
attributable
to
export
sales.
in
order
to
determine
the
extent
of
this
income
tax
benefit,
it's
obviously
critically
important
to
determine
precisely
how
much
net
income
is
generated
by
a
company's
export
sales
in
any
particular
year.
in
enacting
the
disc
statute,
congress
said
quite
specifically
how
it
expected
this
export
net
income
calculation
to
be
made.
gross
revenues
from
export
sales
were
to
be
reduced
only
by
those
costs
that
were
directly
and
factually
related
to
the
export
income.
export
sales
revenues
were
not
to
be
burdened
with
unrelated
expenses
which
would
distort
the
true
amount
of
export
income,
and
thereby
reduce
the
intended
incentive.
the
disc
regulations,
which
were
promulgated
shortly
after
the
statute
was
passed,
reiterate
that
there
must
be
a
direct
factual
relationship
between
export
sales
and
expenses.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
justice
scalia,
we
get
it
out
of
two
separate
statutory
provisions.
one
is
section
994.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
these
are...
this
is
found
on
page
27a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
and
specifically,
the
reference
in
994(a)
and
994(a)(2)
to
the
requirement
that
a
determination
must
be
made
of
the
net
income,
quote,
attributable
to
export
receipts.
we
think
that
the
common
sense
nature
of
the
word
attributable,
which
this
court
in
the
tax
context
has
construed
to
mean
generated
by,
or
caused
by,
is
that
you
have
to
take
the
export...
the
revenues
from
exports
and
reduce
them
only
by
the
costs
or
deductions
that
are
related
to
those
exports,
or
else
you
can't
possibly
come
up
with
a
true
figure
of
export...
net
export
income
that's
attributable
to
those...
to
those
sales.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
it
relies
on
a
provision,
which
we'll
talk
about
in
a
few
minutes,
that
has
many,
many
applications,
and
it
may
well
be
that
in
a
number
of
those
other
applications,
it's
perfectly
valid.
our
position
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
as
i
hope
to--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--because
it...
the
disc
provisions
are
unique
in
a
number
of
respects,
one
of
which
it
allows
the
taxpayer
to
engage
in
a
particular
grouping
of
transactions,
and
the...
the...
as
we'll
talk
about
in
a
few
minutes,
the
r&d
regulations
insist
that
r&d
be
attributed
in
a
way
that
disregards
the
particular
groupings
that
the
taxpayer
has
selected.
but
there's
another
statutory
provision
that
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to,
your
honor,
and
that's
section
861.
861
is
a
section
of
the
code
that
has
been
in
the
code,
was
in
the
code
for
more
than
50
years
at
the
time
the
disc
statute
was
passed,
and
it
provides
for
how
deductions
are
to
be
allocated
to
gross
income.
this...
this
appears
at
page
26a
of
the
appendix.
now
congress,
in
passing
the
disc
statute,
said
quite
specifically
that
it
wanted
deductions
under
the
disc
statute
to
be
allocated
in
a
way
generally
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
section
861,
which
were
well-established
at
that
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
congress
said
that
in
the
reports
of
the
house,
of
the
tax-writing
committee.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it's
not
in
the
statute.
it's
in
the
reports
of
the
tax-writing
committees.
but,
your
honor,
these
were
not
idle
statements.
these
were
not
statements
of
individual
congressmen,
or
statements
on
the
floor.
these
were
deliberate
statements
put
in
the
reports
of
both
the
house
and
senate
tax-writing
committees
which
focused
specifically...
specifically...
on
how
congress
expected
these
deductions
to
be
allocated.
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--your
honor,
these
were
specific
statements
that
went
to
the
heart
of
the
issue
that's
before
the
court
today,
and
we've
quoted
them
at
page
22
of
our
brief,
the
blue
brief.
congress
said
that
these
861
rules--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
committee
reports
said...
excuse
me,
justice
scalia.
the
committee
reports
said
that...
that
the
861
rules,
which
are
important
because
later
the
regulations
themselves
under
disc
reference
the
861
rules,
so
it's...
and
that's
the
heart
of
the
government's
argument
in
this
case,
so
it's
important
to
understand
what
people
thought
at
the
time
these
861
rules
meant.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
but
the...
the
regulation,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
government
relies
on
was
added
to
861
after
the
disc
regulations
were
finalized.
it
was
added
in
1977.
the
disc
statute
was
passed
in
1971.
the
disc
regulations
were
finalized
in
1975.
so
our
position
is
it's
important
to
understand
what
congress
in
1971
thought
it
was
doing
in
the
disc
statute,
and
therefore
it
seems
to
us
extremely
important
that
it
said
that
it
expected
deductions,
including
presumably
any
deduction,
including
r&d,
to
be
allocated
in
accordance
generally
with
the
principles
of
section
861,
which
were
described
quite
clearly
in
the
senate
and
house
reports
of
the
tax-writing
committees
to--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not...
not
quite,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
not
manipulable.
it
has
to
satisfy
the
regulations
promulgated
under
disc.
the
disc
regulations...
and
here
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
33a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
and
specifically
the
grouping
regulations...
provide
that
a
taxpayer
can
only
group...
can
only
group
transactions
if
they
fall
within
a
recognized
industry
product
line.
so,
in
other
words,
you
can't...
you
can't
allocate
expenses
to
any
sorts
of
transactions
you
want.
they
have
to
be
grouped
in
a
way
that's
consistent
with
the
disc
statute.
and
that's
exactly
what
boeing
did
here.
the
blue
sky
r&d
was
attributable
to
all
of
their
airplane
products,
and
therefore
it
was
allocated
to
the
groupings
of
all
of
the
different
airplane
programs.
these
program-specific
r&d...
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
factual
dispute
about
this.
the
program-specific
r&d
was
factually
and
directly
related
only
to
a
specific
program.
the
747
r&d,
for
example,
was...
was
factually
and
directly
related
only
to
the
747
program.
and
that's
why
boeing
allocated
that
r&d
only
to
the
747
program.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
it's
one...
it's
one
disc.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
because,
justice
stevens,
under
the
statute,
combined
taxable
income
or
export
income
is...
is
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
product
groupings,
or
at
least,
the
taxpayer
has
the
option
of
choosing
to
group
by
different
products
rather
than
by
all
the
sales
of
the
disc.
so,
therefore,
here,
we
determine
what
the
export
income
is
for
the
747
program,
which
takes
the
revenues
from
the
747
program
and
reduces
them
by
the
deductions,
including
r&d
that's
factually
and
directly
related
to
the
747
program,
and
you...
you
come
up
with
the
cti
for
the
747
program.
under...
it's
not
all
mixed
together
as
one
group
of
export
income.
under...
under
the
statute
and
regulations
boeing
was
entitled
to
group
transactions.
the...
the
problem
here
is
that
the
regulation
that
the
government
relies
on
takes
huge
amounts
of
r&d
that
are
directly
related
to
a
specific
program
and
allocates
them
among
all
of
the
programs.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
it
doesn't
really
matter
whether
the
product
is
on
the
market
or
not,
your
honor.
it
has
to
be
allocated
to
a
class
of
gross
income.
now,
that
class
of
gross
income
may
well
include,
as
it
does
in
this
case,
products
or
programs
that
aren't
yet
on
the
market
that
are
being
developed.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
nonetheless,
the
regulations
are
quite
clear
that
the
deductions
have
to
be
allocated
to
that
class
of
gross
income.
so,
for
example,
in
the
757
program,
which
was
in...
which
was
being
developed
in
1982,
there
were
no
sales
of
the
757
in
1982,
and
yet
there
were
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
r&d
expended
in
that
year.
in
our
view,
the
regulations
make
it
quite
clear
that
boeing
had
to
allocate
those
deductions,
that
r&d
and
other
deductions,
to
the
757
program.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
justice
souter,
you've
described
the
government's
position.
let
me
see
if
i
can
respond
to
it.
but
generally,
just...
as
to
the
last
point...
this
is
not
a
legislative
regulation.
there
really
is
no
chevron
deference
that's
in
play
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
is
some
degree
of
reasonableness.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
was,
but
it
was
promulgated
under
section
7805.
there's
no
specific
provision
in
the
code
that
allows
the
treasury
to
issue
legislative
regs
here,
but
i
don't
want
to
get
off
on
that
because
it--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
it
does
but
it
has
to
be
consistent,
obviously,
with
the
legislative
scheme
that
it's
interpreting.
justice
souter,
let
me
answer
your
question
a
number
of
different
ways.
first,
it
is
not
at
all
unique
for
expenses
to
give
rise
to
future
year
income.
in
fact,
most
expenses
give
rise
to
future
year
income.
the
fact
that
an
expense
may
occur
in
year
1,
and
the
income
may
be
generated
in
year
2,
is
a
commonplace.
it
doesn't
in
any
way--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
don't
accept...
they
can't
capitalize
it,
your
honor,
because
congress
made
a
judgment
in
section
174
of
the
code
in
order
to
encourage
r&d
to
allow
it
to
be
immediately
deducted
in
the
year
in
which
it's
incurred.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
but
the
government's
regulation
here
is
not
close
at
all.
the
government
concedes
that...
that
expenses
for
r&d
give
rise
to
future
year
income.
they
can't...
because
of
section
174,
they
can't--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
look
at
what
the
8(e)(3)
regulation
does,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
make
any
attempt
to
match
current
year
r&d
expenses
with
some
future
income
that
might
be
generated
from
that
r&d.
what
it,
instead,
does,
it
allocates
all
of
that
income
to
current
year
expenses...
to
current
year
revenues
for
products
that
have
no
relation
whatsoever
to
that
r&d.
for
example,
let
me
say...
come
back
again
to
the
757
program.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
sure.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
i'm
saying
that...
that...
i'm
saying
clearly
in
this
case
it's
factually
wrong.
for
example,
this
case
went
off
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
there
was
really
no
dispute
that
boeing
had...
as
a
factual
matter...
allocated
the
r&d
expenses
correctly.
as
a
factual
matter.
the
government
said
they
had
to
be
reallocated
because
of
this
conclusive
presumption
in
section
8(e)(3).
but,
yes,
i'm
telling
you,
justice...
justice
souter,
that
that's
incorrect
as
a
factual
matter,
that
in
fact,
under
section
174,
in
order
to
take
a
deduction
for
r&d
at
all
in
any
circumstance,
disc
or
no
disc,
the
taxpayer
has
to
be
able
to
factually
relate
that
r&d
expense
to
a
particular
product.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
factual
relationship.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
but
if
there...
there
could
well
be
a
spill-over
benefit
to
future
product
lines,
but
that
doesn't,
a,
mean
that
it's
not
directly
and
factually
related
a
specific
current
program.
and
also,
look
at
the
oddity
and
anomaly
of
the
government's
position
here,
justice
souter.
even
if
it
is...
there
is
some
spill-over
effect
for
future
product
lines,
when
the
government...
when
the...
when
boeing
was
developing
the
757,
it's
conceivable
that
they
were
learning
things
that
would
benefit
future
products.
but
what
the
government
does
is
take
all
that
r&d
and
allocate
it
to
existing
products,
sales
of
existing
products
that
couldn't
possibly
have
benefitted
from
that
r&d.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
861.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's...
that
is
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--what's
legally--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well...
well,
there
are
a
number
of
things
wrong
with
that,
justice
breyer.
the
first
is,
as
you
yourself
pointed
out.
at
the
time
congress
made
this
cross-reference,
at
the
time
the
legislative
history
said
that
the
rules
under
861
would
be
followed,
and
at
the
time
the
regs
were
issued
in
1975
that
cross-referenced
861,
this
8(e)(3)
rule,
which
is
an
aberrational
rule,
doesn't
follow
the
general
guidelines
of
the
861
rules.
it
was
not
even
in
the
regulation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
oh,
absolutely.
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
no,
no.
the
reg
has
many
other
applications,
and
we're
not
suggesting
that
it
be--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i'm
saying
disc
is
different,
justice
breyer.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
let
me
explain,
if
i
could--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--why
disc
is
different.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
disc
is
different
because...
for
two
reasons.
one
is,
disc
provides
preferential
tax
benefits
to
a...
to
a
subclass
of
net
income,
export
net
income.
it
is
critically
important
to
have
an
accurate
calculation
of
what
the
export
net
income
is.
you
cannot
have
an
accurate
calculation
of
the
net
income
from
sales
of
747s
if
you're
going
to
start
with
the
gross
revenues
from
the
sale
of
747s,
and
then
you're
going
to
deduct
from
it
expenses
that
have
no
factual
relationship
to
747s.
you
inevitably
are
going
to
be
left
with
an
erroneous
net
income
calculation.
now,
i
want
to
also
add
that
this
was
focused
on
in
1973
and
1975
when
the
treasury
was
issuing
its
disc
regulations.
in
1973,
treasury
issued
proposed
regulations
under
861
that
specifically
said
how
r&d
was
going
to
be...
was
going
to
be
allocated
in
the
context
of
a
disc.
they
gave
an
example,
which
is
identical
to
the
example
of
this
case.
it
was
an
example
involving
a
manufacturer
that
manufactured
four,
six,
and
eight-cylinder
engines.
each
was
grouped
as
a
separate
product
line,
as
it
was
entitled
to
be--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
is
identical.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
because--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--you'd
have
to
look...
you'd
have
to
look--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--you'd
have
to
look
at
those
statutes.
it
may
well
be
that
8(e)(3)
couldn't
be
applied
there
at
all
if
it
would
lead
inevitably
to
an
incorrect
calculation
of...
of
that
net
income.
but
there's
something
in
addition
here,
your
honor.
two
things
in
addition.
first,
justice
breyer,
the
994
regulations
do
not
incorporate
verbatim
all
of
these
861
rules.
they
don't
incorporate
8(e)(3).
they
don't
incorporate...
they
say
that
the
allocations
to
be
made
under
section
994
are
to
be
done
generally
in
accordance
with
the
rules
under
861.
at
the
time
that
that
was
put
in
the
regulations,
the
rules
under
861
unequivocally
provided
that
there
had
to
be,
for
every
allocation,
a
direct
factual
relationship
between
the
expenditure--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--not...
not--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
believe,
justice
scalia,
not
if
an
aberrational...
not
if
a
rule
could
be
put
in
several
years
later
that's
inconsistent
with
the
rules
that
the
tax-writing
committees
and
that
the
treasury
department
assumed--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--would
be
the
861
rules.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
excepts--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but
not
pursuant
to
the
rules.
this
is...
if
you
look,
in
fact,
at
the
8(e)(3)
regulation,
justice
scalia,
it
begins
by
explaining
why
it's
deviating
from
the
general
rules
of
861,
why
it
felt
the
need
for
r&d
to
deviate
from
the
general
rules
that
require
a
factual
connection
between
expenditures
and
revenues.
now,
there's
another...
there's--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
is.
it
is
certainly
the
specific
controls
over
the
general.
it
is
also
the
fact
that
there
was
a
regime
here
that
requires
a...
accurate
calculation
of
export
income.
the
rules
that
were
promulgated
in
1975
did
that.
an
aberrational
rule
was
put
in
in
1977
which
we
say
is
inconsistent
with
the
accurate
calculation
of
net
income
and
can't
be
applied,
at
least
in
this
context.
but
there's
another
reason,
justice
kennedy,
why
the
1977
8(e)(3)
regulation
is
inconsistent
with
disc,
and
that's
the
grouping
regulations,
which
i
want
to
call
your
attention
to,
which
is
a
very,
very
important
part
of
the
disc
statute.
if
i
could
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
grouping
regulations
which
appear
at...
at
994(c)(7),
which
is
the
bottom
of
page
33a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
you
will
see
that
the...
the
taxpayer
was
entitled
to
group
its
products,
to
figure
out
export
income
not
in
gross,
but
on
the
basis
of
each
product
or
recognized
product
line,
which
is
what
boeing
did
here.
and
if
the
court
would
look
at
(6)(iv)
in
the
middle
of
page
33a,
you'll
see
that
the
regulations
provide
that
the
taxpayer's
choice
as
to
how
to
group
is
controlling...
controlling.
and
the
regulations
go
on
to
say
that
costs
deductible
in
a
particular
year
shall
be
allocated
and
apportioned
to
the
classes
of
gross
income
resulting
from
such
grouping.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
that's
the
government's
argument.
but
it's
completely
inconsistent
with
the
words
of
the
regulations,
justice
kennedy.
the
regulations
say
that
all
of
the
determinations
under
(c)
have
to
be
made
consistent
with
the
grouping,
including
the
allocation
of
deductions.
so--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
says
it
in
the
language
that
i
just
read
to
you,
that
the...
all...
that
the
costs
deductible
in
a
taxable
year
shall
be
allocated
to
the
items
of
gross
income
resulting
from
such
grouping.
so,
here,
boeing
grouped
its...
its
classes
of
gross
income--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--excuse
me.
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i'm
reading...
i'm
reading
in
the
middle
of
page
33,
justice
stevens,
the
(iv),
the
paragraph--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--which
talks
about
how
costs
are
to
be
allocated
after
the
taxpayer
has
chosen
particular
groupings.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
under
disc.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
exactly
right,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there's...
there's
nothing
in
this--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i'm
reading...
sub
(iv),
(iv).
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
(iv),
justice
kennedy.
this
is
crucial.
and
if
you
look
at
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
in
st.
jude,
this
is
one
of
the
provisions
that
it
referred
to
as...
as
showing
that
8(e)(3)
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--you
have
inconsistent--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
justice--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
appreciate
that,
justice
o'connor.
you
don't
defer,
i
think,
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
language
of
the
statute...
it's
critical
to
determine
an
accurate
calculation
of
export
net
income.
the
8(e)(3)
regulation
provides
conclusive
presumptions
in
place
of
factual
matching
so
that
it
inevitably
will
lead
to
an
incorrect...
and
secondly,
as
i
said,
the...
it
was
the
understanding
of
everyone,
including
the
treasury
department
when
it
issued
the
disc
regulations
in
1975,
that
the
taxpayer's
choice
of
grouping
would
be
controlling,
that...
that
allocations
of
deductions,
including
r&d
deductions,
would
be...
be
made
on
the...
on
the
basis
of
the
taxpayer's
grouping.
and
when
8(e)(3)
comes
in,
it
says,
no,
no,
no.
for
r&d--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
no,
no.
i
think
it
refers
to
the...
to
the
choices
that
are
to
be
made
in
paragraph
(vii)
at
the
bottom
of
page
33a,
and
the
top
of
34a.
the
groupings
are...
you
can...
you
can
determine
cti,
justice
stevens,
either
on
the
basis
of
each
individual
transaction,
which
would
be
very,
very
cumbersome.
congress
understood
that
and
therefore
expected
that
there
would
be
grouping.
the
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
choose
two
different
ways
to
group
its
transactions.
one
is
by
recognized
product
line...
which
is
what
boeing
did
here,
the
747s,
the
767s,
the
recognized
product
lines...
or
basis
of
sic
code.
boeing
could
have
chosen
to
group
its
transactions
by
sic
code.
it
chose
not
to
do
that.
and
nonetheless,
the
8(e)(3)
regulation
comes
in
and
insists
that
although
all
other
deductions
can
be
made
on
the
basis
of
the
product
groupings
chosen
by
boeing,
which
the
regulations
say
are
to
be
controlling,
this
one
class
of
deductions,
r&d,
has
to
be
allocated
on
the
basis
of
sic
code.
and
that's
completely
inconsistent
with
the
statement
in
the
middle
of
page
33a
that
we
were
talking
about
that
says
that
all
of
the
deductions
are
to
be
allocated
on
the
basis
of
the
taxpayer's
grouping,
and
that
that
grouping
is,
in
the
words
of
the
regulation,
controlling.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
all
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
you
did
a--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
the...
actually--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
no.
it
would
actually
help
our
argument.
if
you
did
it
transaction-by-transaction,
you
took
an
individual
sale
of
a
747--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--airplane
and
you
tried
to
figure
out
what
the
export
net
income
was
from
that
sale,
it
seems
to
me
you
would
start
with
the
cost
of
the...
of
the
revenues
generated
by
the
sale
of
that
single
airplane,
and
then
you
would
try
to
figure
out
what
costs
were
incurred
in
producing
that
airplane,
including
the
r&d
costs.
you
would
never,
i
think,
take
costs
that
were
incurred
that
year
in
trying
to
develop
a
787
airplane,
which
had
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
the
sale
of
that
747,
and
attribute
those
costs
to
it
in
order
to
reduce
the
net
income.
that's
what
the
8(e)(3)
regulation
does.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
so
much
to
say.
justice
kennedy,
i
think
you
put
your
heart
on
the...
on
the
government's...
the...
the
problem
with
the
government's
position
here.
it's
simply
an
unwillingness
to
accept
the
fact
that
congress
created
a
number
of
incentives
here
that
were
not
designed
simply
to
raise
revenue.
they
had
other
purposes
such
as
the
export...
the...
the
beneficial
treatment
of
export
income
and
also
the
immediate
deductibility
of...
of
r&d.
now,
the
government
tries
to
defend
this
regulation
here
on
the...
on
the
basis
that
there's
this
temporal
mismatch
and
it's
all
the
result
of
not
capitalizing.
i
should
say
a
number
of
things
about
that.
first,
this
was
not
the
basis
for
the
regulation
at
the
time
the
regulation
was
issued.
it
was
not
the
basis
for
defending
this
regulation
in
the
lower
courts.
and
it...
and
the
government's
position
is
not
even
consistent
with
that
regulation
because
if
the
whole
problem
here
is
the
lack
of
a
temporal
mismatch,
you
would
think
that
if
you
had
a
class
of
gross
income
in
which
in
a
particular
year
there
was
both
revenues
and
r&d
expenses,
well,
in
that
situation
there's
no
temporal
mismatch.
they
would
at
least
allow
you
to
allocate
those
r&d
expenses
to
that
revenue
in
that
year.
no.
even
if
there's
revenue
in
a
class
of
gross
income
in
a
particular
year,
they
still
insist
that
those
r&d
expenses
be
spread
across
all
of
the
income
in
that
sic
code.
now,
i
want
to
mention
st.
jude,
because
in
this
case
we're
dealing
with
airplanes
and
airplanes,
and
while
the...
the
costs
are
specifically
allocated
only
to
particular
programs,
it
gets
a
little
more
complicated.
but
look
at
st.
jude.
in
st.
jude,
you
had
a
manufacturer
who
was
exporting
artificial
heart
valves.
that's
all
it
was
doing,
is
manufacturing
and
exporting
artificial
heart
valves.
in
the
same
year,
it
was
engaging
in
r&d
for
insulin
pumps,
and
for
pacemakers.
the
government
insisted
that
the
export
income
from
the
sale
of
those
heart
valves
be
reduced,
and
that
the
disc
benefit
be
reduced
because
of
the
r&d
spent
on
these
other
products
that
obviously
had
no
basis
or
relevance
to
the
sale
of
the
heart
valve
simply
because
they
were
all
within
the
broad...
same
broad
sic
code.
and
i
should
say,
justice
kennedy,
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
i
think
is
somewhat
unintelligible.
the...
the
part
that
you...
you
referred
to,
we
all
stumbled
over
because
it
makes
no
sense.
the
more
narrowly...
the
more
narrowly
you
define
your
classes
of
gross
income,
the
more
that...
that
costs
will
be
directly
allocated
to
more
than
one
class
of
income.
it's
not
a
question
of
anything
being
indirectly
allocated.
and
there's
no
default
rule
at
issue
here
either
because
all
of
our
costs
are
directly
allocable
to
specific
programs.
that's
all
we
ask
that
we
be
allowed
to
do.
we
ask
that
the
judgment
in
the
ninth
circuit
be
reversed.
thank
you.
