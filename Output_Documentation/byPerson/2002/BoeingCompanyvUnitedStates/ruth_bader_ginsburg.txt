mr.
geller,
there's
one
problem.
perhaps
you
can
cast
some
light
on
it.
the
word
is
attributable
that
you
pointed
to
in
994.
and
the
r&d
you
have
divided
into
blue
sky
and
program
or
product-specific.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that...
that's
boeing's
creation.
the
r&d...
that
division
is
eminently
manipulable,
it
seems
to
me,
if
it...
it's
the
distinction
between
whether
it's
allocated
across
the
board
because
of
blue
sky
or
particular
program
or
project
depends
on
some
official
act
by
a
corporate
board
which
could
be
yesterday,
could
be
next
month.
it's
in
the
control
of
the
corporation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
a
notice
and
comment
regulation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
if
it's...
whether
you
call
it...
if
you
call
it
an
interpretive
regulation--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
still
deserves
some
respect
from
a
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--does
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
code
3,
would
there
be
any
difference?
it
was
still
transportation
equipment
as
a
category.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
i
thought...
maybe
i'm
confused,
but
i
thought
the
government's
position
was
blue
sky,
product-specific...
this
is
r&d
and
we
treat
r&d
a
certain
way
and
we
don't
buy
into
that
line,
which
is
set
by
the
company.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
can
you
tell
us
this
continuing
significance
of
this
arrangement?
i...
we're
now
past
the
successor
of
the
fsc.
is
that
true?
