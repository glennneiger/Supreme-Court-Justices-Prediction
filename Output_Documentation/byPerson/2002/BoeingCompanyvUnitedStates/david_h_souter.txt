h.
souter
well,
what...
what
do
you
say
to
at
least
this
argument
of
the
government?
i...
i
guess
the
government
would
probably
say,
sure,
there's...
there's
a
kind
of
factual
sense
in
which
there
is
the
kind
of
relationship
that
you're
talking
about.
but
if
you
want
the
closest
relationship...
the
most
perfect
relationship...
you
would
capitalize
your
r&d
and
you
would
start
amortizing
it
when
you
actually
have
a
product
that
is
generating
income
that
you're
selling.
that
would
be
the
closest
match
you
could
get.
that
match,
in
effect,
has...
has
been...
has
been
set
aside.
instead
of
forcing
you
to
do
that,
the
law
now
allows
you
to...
to
use
your
r&d
as...
as
a
current
expense.
once
you
start
using
it,
once
you
start
treating
it
as
a
current
expense,
that
very
close
relationship
that
you
have,
if
you
had
capitalized
it,
is
gone.
and
what
the
government
is
saying
is,
it's
a
judgment
call
how
close
it's
got
to
be
now,
now
that
you
have
broken
the
link
and
have
allowed
current
expense.
and
that
kind
of
a
judgment
call
is
quintessentially
the
judgment
call
that
the...
that
the
treasury
makes
when
it's
write...
when
it
writes
regulations.
and
why
isn't
that
a
pretty
powerful
argument?
and
if
it
is,
how
do
you
get
over
the
point
of
reasonableness
or...
or
chevron
deference
as
the
government
would
see
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's...
there's...
certainly
there
is
some
degree
of
deference
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
can
argue
whether
it's
chevron
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure
they
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
most
precise
way
to
match
it,
i...
i
would
suppose,
is
the
capitalization
way.
and
the
government
says
once
you...
once
you
lose
the
quintessentially
perfect
way
of
doing
it,
then
how
you're
going
to
recognize
it
is
a
judgment
call.
justice
david
h.
souter
absolutely.
and
they
say
when
congress
made
that
judgment,
there's
a
further
judgment
left
and
that
is
the
judgment
how
close
has
it
got
to
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
sometimes...
sometimes
they
do
and
sometimes
they
don't.
i
mean,
if
things
work
out
fine,
the
answer
is
yes.
if
they
don't
work
out
fine,
the
answer
is
no.
and
that's...
that's
one
of
the...
that's
one
of
the
problems
that
the
government
raises.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
here...
may...
may
i
interrupt
you
with
this
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
say
it
has
no
relation
whatsoever.
i
take
it
then
you
are
saying
that
the
government
is
simply
factually
wrong
when
it
makes
the
statement
that
r&d,
which
may
have
a
closer
relation
to
one
product
line
than
another,
nonetheless
tends,
as
a
general
rule,
to
have
benefits
that
go
beyond
product
lines.
we...
they...
they,
in
effect,
say,
look,
you
learn
useful
things,
and
you
use
them
all
over
the
place.
are
you
saying
that
that
is
factually
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
you've
got
to
show
the
relationship--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
there
is
no
benefit
to
product
lines
outside
of
that
relationship.
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
are
the...
just
out
of
curiosity,
what
are
the
rough
proportions
of...
of
overseas
and
domestic
sales?
