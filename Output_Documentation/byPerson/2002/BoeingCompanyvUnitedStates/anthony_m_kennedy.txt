justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
why
does
861
get
you
out
of
the
general
allocation
provisions
any
more
than
994
does?
in
other
words,
the
question
was,
why
do
we
ignore
the
usual
rule
for
apportionment
of
r&d?
and
you
said,
well,
because
994
is...
is
specific
and...
and
has
some
policies
of
its
own.
and
then
you
said...
and
to
further
that
argument,
you
show
us
861.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
regs
that
we're
talking
about,
which
the
government
relies
on,
are
under
861.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you...
if
you
want
me
to
say
that
a
regulation
drawn
after
a
statute
was
enacted,
another
statute,
is...
is
invalid
because
the
intervening
statute
is...
is
applicable
instead,
what...
what
case
do
i
cite,
or
what
rule?
is...
is
the
rule
just
that
the
specific
controls
over
the
general?
i
mean,
is
that
all
we're
talking
about?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now...
now,
perhaps
you
can
help
me
here
because
this
is
a
complicated
statute.
is
the
government
going
to
answer
that,
of...
of
course,
that
is...
is
controlling,
but
that
is
only
for
the
purpose
of
one
of
the
three...
of...
of
one
of
the
three
choices
that
it
makes
in...
and...
and
it's
made
the
choice
to
have
the
combined
income?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
where...
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
you're
reading
under
(iii)?
sub
(iii)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
sub
(iv).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
mean
the
reg?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
getting
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
and
i
think
it
relates
to
what
justice
o'connor
is
asking
too,
is...
is
your
answer
to
the
last
argument,
that
a
transaction-by-transaction
basis...
we
would...
would
clearly
not
have
this
problem...
is
we
clearly
would
have
this
problem
and
we'd
look
at
861,
and
you'd
lose
there
too?
or
is
that
not
your
answer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
i
want
to
know
what
your
position
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
you
use
this
link...
this
severance
argument,
and
you
say,
oh,
well,
once
you
do
this,
you
sever
the
expense
from
the
future
income.
i
would
have
thought...
please
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
all
expenses
are...
are
severed
in
the
sense
that
all
expenses
can
be
used
for
future
income.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
just
as
a
housekeeping
matter,
if
boeing
were
to
prevail
here,
would
it
still
be
open
for
the
government
to
say,
well,
all
right,
you
can
allocate
along
your
product
lines,
but
the
blue
sky
portion
still
has
to
be
greatly
increased?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
i've
got
the
right
color.
the
red
sky
and
the
blue
sky.
the
blue
sky
is
the
general.
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
was
about
some
20
percent.
if...
if
the...
if
boeing
prevails,
can
you
still
go
back
and
say,
okay,
you
get
the
product
line,
but
you've
got
to
add
another
20,
30
percent
to
the
blue
sky?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
doing
is...
is
quarreling
with
the
decision
congress
made
under
174.
congress
said
r&d
is
inherently
something
that
ought
to
be
capitalized,
but
we
think
it's
so
important,
it's
going
to
be
expensed.
and
you
keep
saying
that,
well,
you
know,
really
it
can't
be
expensed.
we're
going
to,
in
effect,
make
them
capitalize
it
anyway.
that...
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion...
and
it's
the
paragraph
at
12(a).
i
think
you'll
be
familiar
with
this
one,
where
the
court
of
appeals
said,
the
more
narrowly
a
taxpayer
chooses
to
define
incomes,
the
more
costs
become
indirectly
or
indefinitely
related.
can
i
be
excused
from
trying
to
understand
that,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
really
was
restating
the
problem
rather
than
offering
a
specific
solution.
