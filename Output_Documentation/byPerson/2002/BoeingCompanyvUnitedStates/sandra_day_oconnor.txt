these
are
the
regulations--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
the
disc
scheme.
justice
sandra

o'connor
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
this
is
how
treasury
initially
thought
the
disc
scheme
should
be--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
problem
is
then
along
come
regulations
under
the
general
861
provision
governing
r&d
expenses,
and
they
don't
track
each
other.
so
how
is
it
that
we--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--don't
defer
to
the
treasury
department
interpretation?
that's
the
sticking
point
for
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
owe
some
kind
of
deference.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
is
kind
of
simplistic,
but
it
does
seem
that
in...
in
the
1970s,
congress
wanted
to
encourage
exports,
and
to
do
that,
they
thought
they
should
make
some
income
tax
advantages
for
companies
producing
products
for
export.
and
that
involved
allowing
grouping
of
products
and
favorable
income
tax
treatment
which,
if
you
didn't
have
the...
the
861
regulations
on
r&d,
would
allow
the
taxpayer
to
do
what
the
petitioner
is
arguing
here.
so,
it
seems
to
me
the
argument
is
that
the
861
regs
are
just
so
contrary
to
disc
that
they
shouldn't
govern
and
don't
govern.
is
that
the
thrust
of
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
861
applies
generally,
doesn't
it,
not
just
to
discs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
the
whole
scheme
that
congress
passed
in
the
'70s
to
try
to
encourage
exports.
so
it
just...
the
interpretation
of
861
in
the
regs
seems
to
go
somewhat
contrary
to
the
overall
purpose
of
the
scheme
for
discs.
