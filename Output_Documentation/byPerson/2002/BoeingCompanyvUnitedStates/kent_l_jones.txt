mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no.
if
it
were
done
on
a
transactional
basis,
which
is
the...
the
base
case
provision
under
disc,
861
regs
would
tell
us
how
to
allocate
costs
to
the
income
from
that
transaction.
and
what...
i
mean,
really
the...
the
first
point
of
departure
that
mr.
geller
made
from
the
statute
is
that
he
suggests
that
only
costs...
or
that
any...
the
costs
must
be
factually
related
to
an
item
of
income
to
be
set
off
against
it.
but
that's
not
the
statutory
standard.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
oh,
clearly
that's
not
the
case.
the
861
regs
were...
were
formulated
for
the
purpose
of
determining
combined
taxable
income
for
discs
and
fscs.
that's
what
congress...
that's
what
the
committee
said
they
wanted
the
secretary
to
do
under
the
disc,
and
that's
what
the
861...
if
you
look
at
861(f)(1)(iii),
it
says
that
expressly.
so--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it...
it
applies
generally,
but
it
was
specifically
formulated
with
the
calculation
of
combined
taxable
income
for
disc
in
mind.
and
so
it's...
it's
illogical
to
suggest,
as...
as
they
do--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
sorry.
i
meant
the
reg.
the
861-8
reg
was...
was
formulated
with
the
calculation
of
combined
taxable
income
expressly
in
mind,
and
we
know
that
both
by
the
terms
of
the
reg
861-8(f)--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
that's
one
way
of
making
the
point,
but
let
me...
let
me
address
directly--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
my
position
is
they've
totally
misdescribed
the
grouping
provision
of
the
disc
regs,
and
once
you
understand
it,
you
will
appreciate
that
the
861-8
regs
apply
to
all
of
these
transactions.
and
you
can...
you
can
see
that
by
looking
at
only
two
pieces
of
the
disc
regs.
the
disc
regs,
at
page
29a
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
says,
grouping
of
transactions
for
purposes
of
applying
the
pricing
method
is
provided
by
(c)(7).
so,
you
group
to
decide
what
your
pricing
method
is,
and
if
they
choose
the...
the
combined
taxable
income
method,
which
they've
done
here,
then
you
go
to
(c)(6),
which
is
back
on
page
33a.
(c)(6)
says
here's
how
you
determine
combined
taxable
income.
you
take
the
income.
you
deduct
the
costs
of
goods
sold,
and
then
you
allocate
under
provisions
of...
of
section
861
regs.
and
then
the
provision
that
mr.
geller
cites
says...
is
the
(iv)
provision,
which
says
you
that
allocate
the
costs
to
the
items
of
income
resulting
from
the
group.
that's
what
the
grouping
does.
it
groups
the
income,
and
then
against
that
income,
we
apply
the
costs
allocated
under
the
section
861-8
regs.
it
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's
33
of
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
the
last
phrase
of
the...
of
the
item
(iv),
and
it
says
that
we
allocate
costs
to
the
income
resulting
from
the
grouping.
now,
that's
what
the
grouping
is
all
about.
they're
allowed
to
pick
out
a
series
of
transactions,
group
the
income,
calculate
the
cti
for
the
group,
so
they
don't
have
to
file
a
separate
report
for
a
thousand
different
transactions.
that's
all
that
the
grouping
is
about.
now,
that's
been
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
his
own
regulations
for
25
years.
and
of
course,
under
this
court's
precedents,
his
interpretation
of
his
own
regulations
is
entitled
to
controlling
weight
unless
it's
inconsistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
text
of
the
regs.
and
as
the
tax
court
explained
in
the
st.
jude
case,
and
as
i
have
just
described,
the
text
of
the
reg
says
you
allocate
under
861
to
the
income
resulting
from
the
grouping.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you
take
the
gross
receipts
for
that
group--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
then
you
allocate
costs--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--under
861.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's...
that's
a
fair
synopsis
of
their
position,
and...
and
the
defects
in
it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
let
me
start
with
what
the
secretary
was
supposed
to
do
in
the
regs,
and
get
to
you
the
answer
to
your
question.
the...
the
statute
on
which
the
regs
are
adopted
doesn't
just
say
you
allocate
the
costs
that
are
definitely
related
to
the
product
in
determining
what
costs
would
be
charged
against
it.
it
also
says
you
allocate
to
it
a
share
of
costs
that
cannot
definitely
be
allocated
to
any
particular
item
of
income.
now,
when
the
conundrum
for
research
costs...
and
the
reason
that
we
have
a
separate
regulation
for
it
is
that
there's
more
than
one
way
that
research
costs
are
treated
under
the
code.
when
research
costs
are
capitalized
and
amortized
over
their
useful
life,
they're
then
properly
attributed...
as
this
court
said
in
indopco...
to
the
revenues
as
they're
received.
but
when
the
taxpayer
makes
the
election
that
section
174
gives
it
to
take
a
current
deduction,
it
severs
any
relationship
between
the
costs
and
the
income.
there
is
a
mismatching,
as
we
say.
there
is
no
proper
connection
between
the
costs
and
the
income.
now,
the
reason
that
we
need
to...
the...
the...
in
that
case
where
there
is
no
definite
relationship
between
the
costs
and
the
income,
the
default
principle
of
the
statute
is
that
the
costs
are
to
be
allocated
over
all
income
of
the
taxpayer,
not
just
the
income
from
any
specific
product,
but
the
income
from--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the...
a
reason
why
the
regulation
is
reasonable
is
because
if,
as
i
have
just
said,
the
statutory
default
cases...
you
can
apply
it
against
all
income.
what
the
secretary
has
said
is,
well,
i'm
not
going
to
make
you
apply
it
against
all
income.
i'm
going
to
make
you
apply
it
only
against
a
subcategory
of
income,
in
this
case,
the
income
associated
with
sales
of
a
product
from
which
foreign
sales
income
might
be
derived.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
that's
a...
that's
a
fallacy
in...
in
the
suggestion
of
mr.
geller
that
mismatching
occurs
all
the
time.
it's
very
rare
for
mismatching
to
be
tolerated.
for
example,
if
a
taxpayer
spends
$10
building
a
widget
in
year
1,
and
sells
the
widget
in
year
2,
the
$10
he
spent
in
year
1
isn't
mismatched.
it's
put
in
the
inventory
costs.
it's
charged
as
a
component
of
the
costs
of
goods
sold
in
year
2,
when
the
item
is
sold.
the
code
is...
and
the
secretary
is
very
thorough
about
routinely
requiring
matching
of
expenses.
this
is
an
exceptional
situation
created
by
the
congress
allowing
the
current
deduction,
but
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
allowing
the
current
deduction
for
research
doesn't
mean
that
that's...
that
congress
decided
it
was
definitely
related
when
it
was
taken.
it
clearly
isn't
definitely
related.
and
so
my...
my
point
was
that
if
it
would
have
been
reasonable
for
the
secretary
to
just
do
what
the
statute
says,
which
is
we'll
apply
it
against
all
income,
it's
more
reasonable,
the
secretary
decided,
to
apply
it
against
a
smaller
category.
and
then...
and
then
5
or
7
years
later,
the
secretary
decided
it
was
even
more
reasonable
to...
to
apply
it
against
a
somewhat
narrower
category,
and
we
got
down
to
sic
code
3.
well,
these
are
all
alternatives,
each
of
which
is
reasonable.
they're
more
reasonable
than
the
statutory
default
case,
the
secretary
decided.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
for
boeing,
we
can
go
all
the
way
to
sic
code
category
4,
which
is
planes
and
parts.
i
mean,
this...
this
issue
is
sort
of
abstract
in
this
case
because
whatever,
you
know,
objective
test
the
secretary
had
used,
it
would
result
in
the
same
in...
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
talking
about
section
861,
which
is
at
page
26a
of
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
subpart...
part
(b)
in
the
middle
says
that
you
allocate
a
ratable
part.
it
says
par,
but
i
think
that's
ratable
part
of
expenses
which
cannot
definitely
be
allocated
to
some
item
or
class
of
gross
income.
so
you...
and
you...
you
would
under
the
default
case
make
that
allocation
across
all
items
of
income.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if...
if
it's
currently
deducted,
it
cannot
be
definitely
allocated
to
an
item
of
income.
you
see,
petitioner
just
takes
two
words
out
of
the
statute
and
changes
them.
the
statute
says
you
allocate
costs
that
cannot
be
definitely
allocated
to
an
item
of
income.
and
he
says,
well,
we
allocate
costs
that
are
factually
related
to
a
product.
well,
that's
not
what
the
statute
either
says,
or
is
about.
we
allocate
costs
to
income
not
to
products.
now,
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
for
example,
if
they
group
products,
they...
they
group
all
the
sales
of
boeing
707s.
then
you
allocate
the
costs
to
that
group
based
on
the
costs
that
can
be
directly
allocated.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
they
share--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
and
a
share
of
the
costs
that
cannot
be
directly
allocated
to
an
item...
to
any
item
of
income.
now,
this...
the
reasonableness
of
this...
of
the
secretary's
approach
is
especially
clear
in
light
of
the
alternatives
that
he
faced.
if
he
had
adopted
the...
the
position
that
petitioner
prefers,
the
result
would
be
that
petitioner
would
claim
an
expense
against
a
product
that
was
going
to
be
built
and
sold
some
other
time,
and
never
charge
that
expense
against
that
product
when
it's
sold.
now,
the
obvious
and
unimpeachable
result
of
that
is
they
overstate
their
foreign
sales
income.
and
in
this
case,
they
do
it
by
$2
billion
over
the
period
that's
at
stake.
they
overstate
their
foreign
source
income,
which
has
the
direct
consequence
of
overstating
the...
the
disc
and
fsc
benefits
that
they
calculate
based
on
that
amount
of
combined
taxable
income.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that's...
i
don't
understand
the
factual
context
of
that
statement,
but
the...
the
answer
is
all
research
costs,
like
every
other
type
of
cost
gets
charged
against
the
income...
against
foreign
sales
income
to
the
extent
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--proportionally,
yes,
thank
you.
pro
rata
if
it's
not
current...
you
know,
if
it's
currently
claimed
and
not
capitalized
and
amortized.
if
it's
capitalized
and
amortized...
i
should
just
point
out
because
it's...
it
is
a
factual
point
that
is
worth
knowing.
if
it's
capitalized
and
amortized,
then
the
costs
are
recovered
as
part
of
the
cost
of
goods
sold--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
would
just
be
attributable
to
the...
to...
well,
i
mean--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--if
all--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--correct.
if
all
the
sales
were
disc
sales,
then...
then
you
would
be
right.
but
if...
if
some
portion
of
the
sales
were
domestic,
which
is
certainly
the
case
with
boeing,
then
that
portion
would
be
allocated
to
that
portion
of
the
income.
i
mean,
this
pro
rata
allocation
that
i've
been
talking
about,
that
what
you're
allocating
between
is
the
sales
that
the
disc
makes
and
the
sales
that
the
disc
doesn't
make.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
believe
the
record
says
something
like
two-thirds
of
boeing's
sales
during
this
whole
10-year
period
were
overseas
and,
therefore,
i
assume,
made
through
the
disc.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you
mean,
would
it
be
open
at
this
stage--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
at
this
stage
of--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
hate
to
make
a
concession
that
i'm
not
100
percent
certain...
certain
about,
but...
especially
since,
you
know,
it...
it
could
be
of
importance.
i
do
not
believe
that
issue
is
open,
but
it...
but
if
it
were,
i
would
reserve
our
right
to
address
that.
but
i
don't...
i
don't
know
exactly
how
it
would
be
open.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
oh,
i
agree
completely,
but...
but
i
understood
justice
kennedy
to
be
saying
that
if
the
court
adopted
boeing's
approach,
would
there
then
be
a
factual
question
about
what
part...
whether
the
blue
sky
amount
was
accurately
described
in
the
record.
and
i
just
don't
know
for
certain.
my
assumption
is
that
that's
not
still
open.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it...
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
sounds...
it
sounds
like
you
correctly
described
the
statute,
and
let
me
point
out
that
if
they,
for
example,
did
their
fish
research
or
whatever
it
was--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
they
capitalized
and
amortized
it
to
the...
to
the
appropriate
products
and
charged
it,
then...
then
they
would
be
entitled
to--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--(e)--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--(3)(i).
mr.
kent
l.
jones
first,
it
only...
that
only
applies
if
they're
deducted
under
174.
so...
so
we've
narrowed
the
issue
that
much.
and
when
they're
deducted
under
174,
as
i've
said,
there
were
a
series
of
reasonable
alternatives
facing
the
secretary
based
from
the
statutory
default
case
that
you
allocated
across
all
income.
now,
the
reason
i
keep
stressing
that
point
is
because
this
court's
decisions
are
very
clear
that
the
court,
especially
in
the
context
of
treasury
regulations,
doesn't
sit
here
to
decide
the
wisdom
of
the
particular
rule
chosen.
it
only...
in
the
words
of
correll...
looks
to
see
whether
some
reasonable
method
was
applied,
not
whether
this
was
the
best
one,
or
the
most
logical--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no.
we're...
we're
not
making
them
capitalize
it.
i
mean,
i
would
cite,
really,
my
explanation
of
that
as
justice
souter's
question
earlier,
that...
which
is
that
the...
the
decision
to
allow
this
current
deduction
is
effective
in
determining
taxable
income
for
domestic
purposes.
we
don't
dispute
that
there's
a
deduction,
but
i'll
point
out
861...
the
mere
fact
there's
a
deduction
doesn't
tell
you
how
to
allocate
it.
and
the...
861
says
that
if
the
deduction
is
not
definitely
related
to
some
item
of
income,
then
you
charge
it
against
all
the
items
of
income.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
they
actually
want
to--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--just
to
elaborate,
that
go
to
fish
research
that
that...
that
were
deducted
currently
rather
than
amortized
over
the
proper
future
income.
that's...
that's
what
this
case
is
really
all
about
is
this
peculiarity--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--several...
several
courts
have
correctly
said
that
the
purpose
of
the...
of
the
combined
taxable
income
calculation
is
to
serve
as
a
limit
on
the
disc
and
fsc
benefits.
congress
didn't
intend
unlimited
benefits.
they
didn't
intend
to
allow
benefits
of
the
type
that
boeing
is
seeking
where
they
inflate
their
foreign
source
income
by
not...
not
putting
the
costs
against
that
income
in
calculating
it.
and
so,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
the
secretary's
rule
is
designed
to
accomplish
the
correct,
in
the
secretary's
view,
determination
of
combined
taxable
income
for
this
very
purpose.
now,
it...
i
think
that...
that
the
issue
that...
that
may
actually
be
the
one
the
court
wants
to
consider
first
is
that
in
1984,
when
congress
enacted
the
fsc
provision,
it...
it
in
our
view
ratified
and
adopted
the
very
cost...
research
cost
allocation
regulation
that
we
have
in
this
case.
in...
in
the
deficit
reduction
act
of
1984,
there
are
two
provisions
that
relate
to
this
case.
congress
adopted...
enacted
the
fsc
which,
of
course,
is
based
on
the
provisions
of
the
disc,
and...
and
it
also
contains
the
combined
taxable
income
method
of
limiting
the...
the
benefit.
and...
and
at
the
same
time
that
they
adopted
the
fsc,
they
enacted
a
provision
that
took
one
piece
of
this
regulation
out
and
suspended
it.
that's
the
piece
called
geographic
sourcing.
that,
for
purposes
of
citation,
is
1.861-8(e)(3)(ii).
this
case
is
about
1.861-8(e)(3)(i),
which
is
the
rule
that
calculates
combined
taxable
income.
and
when
congress
took
out...
said
we're
going
to
suspend
this
geographic
sourcing
rule
in
this
regulation,
they
said,
we're
not
suspending
this
regulation
for
application
in
calculating
combined
taxable
income
for
discs
and
fscs.
well,
under
this
court's
decision
in
lorillard
v.
pons,
that
is
a
ratification
and
adoption
of
the
regulation.
the
court
made
the
point
in
lorillard
that
when
a--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--under
any
scenario,
that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
i
was
assuming
you
carefully
constructed
your
question.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
can
be
quite
broad.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
can
be
quite
broad.
but
the
point
is
that
it's
not--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's
not...
it's...
the
point
is
it's
not
as
broad
as
the
statutory
default
rule.
the
statutory
default
rule
is
by
definition
reasonable,
and
the...
the
narrower
rule
that
the...
that
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--is
that
you
apply
these
costs
against
all
items
of
income
because
they're
not
definitely
related
to
an
item
of
income.
that's
the
statutory
default
principle.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
in
861(b)
at
page
26a
of
the
petition
appendix.
it
says
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--okay.
now,
on
the
ratification
point,
lorillard
v.
pons
makes
the
point
that
when
congress
enacts
a
statute
that's
based
upon
a...
a
prior...
the
provisions
of
a
prior
act,
it
is
assumed
to
have
adopted
the...
the
administrative
interpretation.
now,
that's
not
a...
by
itself
an
overpowering
presumption,
but
what
lorillard
pointed
out
was
that
when
congress,
in
doing
that,
looks
at
the
agency's
interpretation
and
excised
a
portion
of
it,
the
inference
that
it
approved
the
remaining
part
is
very
strong.
now,
here,
it's
strong
not
only
because
of
that
inference,
but
because
congress
said...
i'm
sorry...
the
committee
that
made
this
amendment
said
that
they...
although
they
were
excising
this
part
about
geographic
sourcing,
that
the
part
about
combined
taxable
income
calculations
for
discs
and
fscs
would
remain
in
effect.
now,
petitioner
says,
but
2
years
later
congress
did
something
that
somehow
negated
that
ratification.
well,
of
course,
the
sub...
congress
can't
change
the
law
as
ratified,
but
that's
not
what
happened
in
'86
in
any
event.
what
happened
in
'86
was
that
the...
the
committee
what
was...
that
was
removing
the
suspension
of
the...
on
the
geographic
sourcing
rule
said
that
we're
not
saying
whether
the
regulation
is
valid
or
not.
well,
the
regulation
that
they
were
talking
about
was
the
geographic
sourcing
rule.
petitioner
says,
well,
they
were
talking
about
the
whole
rule.
no.
they
were
talking
about
the
geographic
sourcing
rule
as
we
know
from
the
last
part
of
that
same
report
which
says
that
nothing
in
this
act
has
anything
to
do
with
the
use
of
these...
of
the...
of
the
research
cost
allocation
regulations
for
calculating
cti...
combined
taxable
income...
for
disc
and
fsc
purposes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
can
try
to
help,
but
i'm...
i
can't
promise
results.
it...
it
looked
to
me
like
what
they
had
in
mind
was
the
thought
that
this...
that
a
taxpayer
who
says
my
research
only
relates
to
wing
nuts
on...
on
this
plane
is...
is
defining
it
so
narrowly
that
it's
not
realistic.
and...
and
indeed,
the
record
of
this
case
reflects
that...
that
research
on
one
type
of
plane
has
applications
on
other
types
of
planes.
and...
and
i
think
what
the
court
was
addressing
there
was
his
view
that...
that
this
was
an
appropriate
accommodation.
this
was
one
of
the
choices
that
the
secretary
had.
it
was
a
reasonable
choice.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
it
was
restating
the
problem
in
a
way
that
indicated
it
felt
that
the
secretary's
choice
was
a
reasonable
one.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
the
fsc
is
no
longer
with
us.
it
was
replaced
by
the
extraterritorial
income
provisions...
maybe
in
'98.
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
two-digit
is...
it
was
replaced
by
the...
the
narrower
three-digit
band
in
'94,
i
believe.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
mean,
again,
if
the
court
wanted...
felt
it
needed
to
look
at
the
two-digit
versus
three-digit,
although
to
me
they're
just,
you
know,
spectrums
along
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--this
case
really
doesn't
present
the
question--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--because,
as
i
said,
there's
just...
is...
there's
no
question
that
boeing
goes
all
the
way
to
sic
4.
and
so
if
the
standard
is
are
the
products
reasonably
related,
which...
which
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
think
you
have
to
consider
it,
but
if
you
did,
i
think
you
would
do
it
in
the
context
of
realizing
these
are
reasonable
alternatives,
and
that
the
secretary
didn't
have
to
pick
the
best
one.
he
just
had
to
pick
one
of
them.
and
i...
if
you
thought
that
none
of
these
were
reasonable,
then...
then,
you
know,
it
wouldn't
matter
which
one
he
picked.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
