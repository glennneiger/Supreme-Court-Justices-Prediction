justice
antonin
scalia
where
do
you...
do
you
get
that
proposition
in
the
statute,
mr.
geller?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
are
these
to
be
found?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
suppose
that...
that
r&d
expenses
have
to
be
attributed
in
a
lot
of
other
instances
under
the
code,
don't
they?
and...
and
doesn't
the
government
use
this
same
procedure
that
it's
been
using
here
in
other...
in
other
areas
where
it
has
to
attribute...
where...
where
r&d
expense
has
to
be
attributed?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
is
that?
i
mean,
why
is
it
attributable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay
elsewhere
to...
to
produce
this
result,
but
not
okay
here
to
produce
this
result?
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
did
congress
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
for
my
benefit,
when
it's
in
the
statute,
would
you
say
congress
said
it.
when
it's
in
legislative
history,
would
you
tell
me
who
said
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
when
you
say
congress
said
it,
i
thought
you
mean
it's
in
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i'm
sure
everybody
who
voted
for
that
knew
about
those
statements.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
committee
said.
please,
please.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
doesn't
mean
when...
you
say
in
accordance
with
861.
does...
does
that
mean
as
it
now
exists,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--861
as
it
may
be
amended
from...
or,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
it
may
be
interpreted
from
time
to
time
by...
by--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
treasury?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
a
different
argument.
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
i'm
saying
is
it
doesn't
seem
to
me,
even
if
you
believed
in...
in
legislative
history,
you
can't
rely
on
the
fact
that
they
say
it's
going
to
be
done
pursuant
to
861.
the
government
says,
we
are
doing
it
pursuant
to
861.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
geller,
i
don't
want
to
eat
up
your...
your
rebuttal
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
the
government
is
going
to
come
back
and
say,
look
it,
if
you
did
it
transaction-by-transaction,
we
would
apply
our
normal
rule
under
861.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it's
a
lot
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
be
correct
if
they
did--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
before
i
lose
the
thread
of...
my
thread
of
thought,
is
it
correct
what
mr.
geller
just
said,
that
if
it
was
done
transaction-by-transaction,
you
would
not
use
the
same...
the
same
allocation
basis
that
you're
using
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
was,
or
the
reg--
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is...
where
that's
last
language
i'm
looking
for?
it's
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--33a,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
his
argument
is
that
it
can...
that...
that
the
research
on
fish
can
definitely
be
allocated
to
fish.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
item
or
class
of
gross
income.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is...
what
is
class
of
gross
income?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
that
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
it
has
to
be
that
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
proportionately.
justice
antonin
scalia
if...
if
the
disc
is
25
percent
of
its
sales--
justice
antonin
scalia
--25
percent
of
its
r&d--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can...
can
i
come
back
to
the
blue
sky
expenses?
a
question
that
was
asked
earlier
caused
me
to
question
my
understanding
of
the
case.
as
i
understand
it,
boeing
is
willing
to
accept
a
ratable
portion
of
the
blue...
blue
sky
expenses
in
its
disc.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
a...
what
it...
what
it's
objecting
to
is...
is
those
expenses
that...
you
know,
that...
that
go
to
fish
research,
those
expenses
that
are
identifiable
to
a
particular
category.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the...
but
the
grouping
can
be
as
broad
as...
as
transportation
equipment.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
pretty
broad
group.
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
lost
me.
the
statutory
default
rule--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
got
you.
