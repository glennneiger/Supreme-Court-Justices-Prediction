mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
based
upon
years
of
experience,
study,
hearings,
and
overwhelming
persuasive
evidence,
congress
concluded
that
the
prompt
removal
of
aliens
convicted
of
committing
serious
felonies
was
essential
to
the
nation's
ability
to
control
its
borders.
detention
of
these
aliens
during
removal
proceedings
was
considered
vital
by
congress
to
effectuate
that
policy,
to
prevent
flight,
to
evade
removal,
and
to
prevent
harm
done
by
recidivist
criminal
aliens.
this
is
a
facial
substantive
due
process
challenge
which
cannot
succeed
unless
there
are
no
sets
of...
no
set
of
circumstances
under
which
the
congressional
policy
would
be
constitutional.
as
this
court
has
repeatedly--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--justice
scalia,
it's
the
government's
position,
as
held
by
three
courts
of
appeals,
that
that
provision
does
not
apply
to
a
habeas
corpus
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
itself,
that
the
language
of
that
provision
relates
to
challenges
to
an
action
by
the
attorney
general
or
administrative
action
and
does
not
preclude
a
challenge.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it's...
it's
our
submission,
after
careful
examination...
the
government
originally
took
that
position
that
you've
suggested
in
court
proceedings.
it
was
rejected
by
three
courts
of
appeals.
we
studied
it
further.
the
government
studied
it
further
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
those
decisions
were
correct
and
it
would
not
preclude...
and
we're
not
contending
here
today--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
we're
relying
on
the
language
that
it
refers
to,
and
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute
refers
to
actions,
administrative
actions,
by
the
attorney
general
or
immigration...
administrative
action
by
administrative
officials,
and
this
court's
construction
of
statutes
against
precluding
constitutional
challenges
to
other
statutes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
while
it
would
be
in
the
government's
interest
to
preclude
this
challenge
at
all,
we
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
court's
decisions,
including
the...
the
court...
the
decision
that
the
chief
justice
mentioned,
would
to...
would
be
to
construe
that
statute
as
not
to
preclude
this
action
in
this
case.
of
course,
that
would
lead...
your
construction
would
lead
to
a...
a
victory
on
behalf
of
the
government
in
this
case,
but
we've
carefully
examined
it,
and
we
think
that
we're
not
advocating
that
position
here
today.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
we...
we
may
be--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we...
we
may
be
wrong,
justice
scalia,
but
we're
referring
to
and
relying
on
the
second
sentence
which
says,
no
court
may
set
aside
any
action
or
decision
by
the
attorney
general
under
this
section.
it
does
not
state...
and...
and
we
think
the
court
would
construe
it
as
not
precluding
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the...
of
the
policy
made
by
the
congress
itself
in
enacting--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
understand,
justice
scalia,
and
the
government
did,
indeed,
make
that
assertion,
take
that
position
in
early
proceedings
in
this
case.
it
was
rejected
by
three
courts
of
appeals.
we
came
to
a
different
conclusion
after
reexamining
it,
and
that's
our
position
here
today.
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated,
congress
has
exceedingly
broad
latitude
in
dealing
with
aliens,
immigration,
and
the
nation's
borders.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
justice
breyer,
the...
the
case
has
not
been
litigated
on
that
basis
from
its
very
beginning.
i
refer
the
court
to
page
9
of
the
joint
appendix
which
is...
which,
at
the
bottom
of
that
section,
articulates
the
requested
relief
by
the...
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
petitioner
seeks
a
declaration
that
this
provision
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
as
violative--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
this...
not
only
is
it
in
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
that
the
individual
was
challenging
on
its
face,
the
district
court
considered
it
on
that
basis,
and
the
ninth
circuit
considered
it
on
that
basis,
and
it's
been
litigated
here
all
the
way
through
by
the...
by
the
respondent
on
that
basis.
if
there
was
to
be
an
as-applied
challenge,
there
would
be
a
great
deal
of
other
considerations.
and...
and
this...
as
this
court
has
said,
the
facial
challenge
must
be
rejected
unless
there
are
no
set
of
circumstances
under
which
the
congressional
policy
would
be
upheld.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there...
there's
been
no--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
and
the
ninth
circuit...
the
ninth
circuit
did
say
that
both
on
page
6...
6a
and...
and
on
page
30a.
but
what...
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
issue
a
broad,
sweeping
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
a
broad
class
of
individuals,
that
is
to
say,
all
lawful
permanent
residents.
that's
the
equivalent
of
a
facial
decision
as
to
unconstitutionality
as
to
a
broad
spectrum
of
the
people
covered.
and...
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
justice--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's...
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mostly
facial.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's...
that
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
did,
and
it's
our
position
that
this...
this
case
must
be
considered
under
those
circumstances
as
a
facial
challenge.
as
i
was
saying,
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
in
connection
with
immigration
and
protecting
the
nation's
borders,
there
is
no
power
at
which
there
is
more
deference
to
congressional
judgment,
no
authority
under
the
constitution
granted
more
to
the
political
branches,
particularly
to
congress.
congress
regularly
makes
rules,
this
court
has
said,
applicable
to
aliens
that
would
be
unacceptable
if
applied
to
citizens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
statute--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--here
there
was
a
conviction,
and
that
is
specifically
what
is
said
in
the
statute
itself.
it's
my
understanding--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--absolutely.
and...
and
what
happens
in
practice,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
either
the
removal
proceeding
is
brought,
as
congress
has
suggested,
if
possible,
during
the
period
of
incarceration
of
the
individual,
or
immediately
upon
release
from
incarceration.
so
we
were
talking,
to
summarize,
a...
this...
this
provision
under
1226(c)
applies
only
to
the
period
of
the
removal
proceeding
itself,
which
was
carefully
distinguished
by
this
court
in
its
zadvydas
decision
of
2
years
ago.
this
is
on...
compared
to
that
zadvydas
decision,
not
an
unlimited,
potentially
permanent
detention
period,
what,
as
the
court
suggested
in...
in
a
distinguishable
situation
a
number
of
years...
years
ago
in
the
carlson
case
involving
members
of
the
communist
party,
a
temporary,
limited
detention
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
individual
in
custody,
an
individual
who's
had
a
full
panoply
of
due
process,
having
been
convicted
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
with
full
due
process
of--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
my
understanding,
justice
stevens,
that
it
applies
to
convictions
after
the
statute
was
passed.
i
may
be
misunderstanding
that,
and
if
so,
i'll
try
to
correct
that
during...
during
rebuttal.
but
that
to
the
vast...
that
would
all...
to
the
extent
that
that
might
be
true
and
i
might
be
mistaken,
that
would
only
illustrate
why
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
the
statute
itself
should
not
be
declared
unconstitutional,
particularly
in
connection
with
individuals
convicted
afterwards.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
this
was
after
the
statute
was
passed,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
justice
souter,
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
test
that
the
court
has
consistently
applied
in
this
area
is
there...
is
there
a
rational
basis,
is
the
congressional
objective
rationally
likely
to
advance
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose.
those
statistics
that
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
which
were
before
congress
when
congress
enacted
this
statute,
provide
the
purpose
for
which
congress
acted.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
under
certain
circumstances,
the
court
has
used
that
language.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the...
the
means
to
achieve
the
objective--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--will
be
looked
at
possibly
separately.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
it
seems
to
me...
and
it
seems
obvious
particularly
in
this
case...
that
the
means
are
wrapped
up
in
the
objective
itself.
what...
it
is
clear
congress
is
dealing
with
a
very
difficult
problem
of
a
certain
category
or
groups
of
aliens
that
were
committing
serious
crimes
in
this
country.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
is...
yes,
justice
souter,
it's
all.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
the
statistics
tell
us
is
that
there
were
large
numbers
of
aliens
committing
serious
crimes
and
that
those...
those
individuals
committing
those
crimes
were
highly
likely
to
be
recidivists
and
that
they
were...
that
class
of
individuals
or
those
groups
of
individuals
were
cultivating
a
criminal
class
that
was
engaging
in
organized--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
80
percent--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the...
the
statistics
have
to
be
looked
at
very
carefully
because
that
20
percent...
20
percent
of
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
no.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in
that...
that...
well,
actually
the...
it's...
it's
worse
than
that,
justice
scalia,
because
that
figure
of
20
percent
who
absconded
were
people
that
had
been,
during
this
period
of
time,
been
given
individualized
hearings.
they
were
the
ones
that,
after
a
hearing,
the
authorities
thought
were
probably
likely
not
to
flee
and
20
percent
of
that
group
did.
when
you
look
at--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
justice
souter,
but
there's
no
question
that
there
were
large
numbers
of
lawful
permanent
resident
aliens
that
were
evading
the
deportation
proceeding
itself.
once
the
deportation--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
the
figure
jumped
to
40
percent
for
people
who
were
never
detained
at
all,
justice
stevens,
and
that's
explained
in
the
brief.
the
20
percent
to
which
you're
referring
are
people
to
which
an
individualized
hearing
was...
was
given.
in
1992
alone,
we're
talking
about
11,000
aliens,
criminal
aliens,
who
had
absconded.
and
we're
not
talking
just
about
showing
up
for
the
hearing
because
if
that
alien
isn't
in
custody,
he
won't...
and...
and
the
figure
jumps
to
90
percent
of
people
that
will
escape
the
deportation
order
itself
if
there--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i...
i
respectfully
disagree
in
this
sense,
that
if
you
have
the
alien
in
custody
during
the...
the
removal
period
itself,
he
will
be
in
custody
at
the
time
the
order
is
issued.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if
he's
not,
it's
very
difficult
for
the
government--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that...
that
is
not
the
way
the
process
works,
justice
stevens.
there
is
a
potential
appeal
that
the
individual
can
take--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
it
is,
and
the
government...
and
the
congress--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
but
this...
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
that
20
to
40
percent...
and
the
statistics
are
difficult
in
this
area.
there
are
such
large
numbers
of
individuals.
we're
talking
about
15,000
criminals
convicted
of
serious
crimes
per
year
that
are...
go
through
this
process.
if...
if
we're
losing
20...
even
20
percent
of
those
individuals
that
are
absconding
from
the
process
and
not
available
for
deportation
or
removal,
that
is
the...
that
is
what
congress
regarded
as
a
very
serious
problem.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
that
20
percent,
justice
stevens...
and
it's
explained
in
the
brief.
that
20
percent
were
the
individuals
for
which
there
had
been
an
individualized
hearing
given
during
that
period
of
time
when
that
process
was
taking
place.
if
you
don't
have
an
individualized
hearing,
of
course,
the
numbers
go
up
higher.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
one
of
the...
one
of
the
problems
that
congress
had
is
that
it
had
experimented
with
that
process.
it
was
not
being
successful.
the
individuals
were
absconding
notwithstanding--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it...
it
appeared...
it
appeared
to
congress
and
it
appeared
to
the
immigration
authorities
to
be
a
reasonably
tough
standard.
the
problem
with
criminal
aliens
is
that
once...
once
they
enter
this
process,
once
they've
been
convicted
after
due
process
of
having
committed
a
serious
crime
and
once
they're
in
that
process,
which
is
virtually
certain
to
lead
to
removal...
i
mean,
this
is...
removal
is
automatic--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's...
that's
correct,
justice--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's...
that's
precisely
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if...
no.
if
you
have
a...
if
you
as--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
i
think
it's
on
page...
pages
26
and
27
of
the
government's
brief
sets
forth
the...
the
regulations
of
the...
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
that
provide
that
you
may
have
an
immediate
hearing
if
it
is
not
you,
if
you
are
a
citizen,
if
you
contend
that
you
didn't...
weren't
convicted
of
a
crime--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
my
understanding
that
what
happens
is
that
there's
an
immediate,
or
a
relatively
prompt
individualized
hearing.
i'm
not
positive
of
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
there
is
the
hearing
that
the
ninth
circuit
talked
about--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--an
individualized
hearing,
which...
which
would
have
applied
all
the
way
across
the
board--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--in
those
cases
under
those
regulations.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
we're...
i'm
not
quarrelling
with
your
characterization
of
what--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
no,
justice--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
i'm
simply--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--this...
we
may
well
be
here
on
another
occasion
defending
a
broader
policy.
but
let
me
emphasize
the
facts
that
distinguish
what
you're
suggesting
and
what
the
court
considered
in
the
zadvydas
case,
an
immense
difference
that
exists
between
the
circumstances
here,
and
the
circumstances
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
statute
makes
no
distinction.
the
ninth
circuit,
of
course,
did
with
respect
to
excludable
aliens,
said
that
with
that
category
of
aliens,
the
statute...
even
under
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning,
the
statute
was
constitutional.
what
we...
the
statute
doesn't
make
that
distinction,
but
what
it
does
do
is
it
provides
for
a
brief,
limited
detention,
which
is
not
unlimited
and
not
potentially
permanent,
of
aliens,
an
area
of
congress'
authorities
at
its
zenith,
convicted
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
with--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
the
question
that
i
believe
i
addressed
earlier
that's
referred
to,
the
regulations...
and
i
hope
i'm
correct...
at
pages
26
and
27
of
the
government's
brief.
the...
the
regulations
provide
for
someone
claiming
who
is
claiming
that
they
are
a
citizen
as
opposed
to
an
alien,
or
claiming
that
the
crime
for
which
they've
been
convicted
was
not
a
covered
crime,
may...
may
have
an
accelerated
hearing,
which
is...
which
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that...
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
they
are
is
what...
they
are...
they
are
lawful
resident
aliens
until
there's
an
order
of
deportation,
but--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--they...
however,
they
have...
they
have
been
convicted
after
due
process
of
a
crime
that
congress
considers
serious,
and
they're
being
held
for
a
limited
period
of
time--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
if...
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
now,
we
haven't
briefed
and
studied
that
and...
and
i
have
to
rely
on
the
answer
that
i
gave
before.
but
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
correct
with...
it
would
be
within
the
power
of
congress
to
do
that
under
certain
circumstances.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
then
i
would've
have
to
answer
the
question
differently.
well,
if...
i
guess
no,
i
guess
i
would...
that...
that's
a
good
answer.
let
me...
let
me--
[laughter]
let
me
just
deal
with
a
few
things
that
were
raised
during
my
colleague's
argument.
first
of
all,
the
date
of
the
offense
that's
involved
in
this
case
was
after
the
enactment
of
this
statute.
on
page
8
of
the
respondent's
brief,
it
is
asserted
that
he
was
convicted
of
petty
theft
with
priors
and
sentenced
to
3
years'
imprisonment
in
1997.
that
was
when
that
conviction
took
place.
secondly...
and
i
think
a
lot
of
time
has
been
expended
with
respect
to
the
question
that
focused
in
large
part
by
justice
breyer.
what
happens
if
it's
not
the
individual?
what
happens
if
he's
really
a
citizen?
what
happens
if
he
wants
to
challenge
whether
this
crime
was
one
that
should
be
covered?
as
we
said
on
page
26...
and
we
cite
the
relevant
provision
of
the
ins
regulations...
those
types
of
things
can
be
challenged
in
an
individualized
bond
hearing
at
which
the...
which
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
talking
about
and
which
is
what
our
opponents
are
talking
about
here,
and
that
those
issues
may
be
raised
at
that
point,
which
is
precisely
what
the
respondents
are
talking
about.
so
that's
already
built
into
the
statute.
now,
one
might
quarrel
with
whether...
what
the
burden
of
proof
is,
and
where
it
should
be
and
how
it
should
be
written,
but
that's
a...
this
is
a
determination
by
the
executive
branch
with
respect
to
the
statute.
if
the
alien
can
show
that
the
ins
is
substantially
unlikely
to
prevail
on
its
underlying
charge
of
removability,
then
the
individual
may
be
released
on
bond.
if
the
decision
goes
against
the
individual,
that
can
be
taken
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
so
there's
a
process
that
takes
care
of
precisely
those...
that
category
2,
as
you
put
it.
now,
that
does
not
deal
with
the
question
of
dangerousness
or
risk
of
flight,
but
that's
what
congress
was
concerned
about
when
it...
when
it
enacted
the
statute.
congress
was
concerned
about
a
situation
in
which
large
numbers
of
individuals
who
commit
serious
crimes...
and
congress
went
to
the
effort
of
define
what
it
thought...
defining
what
it
thought
was
serious
crimes.
now,
if
there
is
some
question
about
that
in
an
individual
case,
or
if
there's
some
question
about
an
aberrational
lengthy
detention,
that
should
be
brought
to
this
court
or
the
courts
below
in
an
as-applied
challenge.
the
respondent
is
saying
here
today
that
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge,
but
that
has
never
been
the
way
this
case
has
been
litigated
from
the
petition,
which
i
cited
as
a
facial
challenge,
through
the
district
court's
decision
to
the...
to
the
as...
the...
the
facial
challenge
in
part
of
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
this
has
been
a
challenge
to
the
congressional
determination
that
people
who
commit
serious
crimes
are
to...
to
be
deportable
as
rapidly
as
possible.
they...
and...
and
to
the...
in
order
for
that
policy
to
be
effectuated,
for
our
borders
to
be
protected,
to
avoid
the
acculturation
of
a
criminal
alien
class
in
the
united
states
that's
operating
freely,
for
a
limited
period
of
time,
that
individual
will
be
detained
during
that
process
until
the
final
order
of
deportation
is
entered.
85
percent
of
the
aliens
that
are
brought
into
these
procedures
don't
even
challenge
the
immigration
decision...
immigration
judge
decision,
and
more
than
half
of
those
cases
are
resolved
within
30
days.
the
statistics
are
in
the
brief.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you.
