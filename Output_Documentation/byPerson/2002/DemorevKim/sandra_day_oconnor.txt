justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it's
your
position,
in
effect,
that
although
the
ninth
circuit
said
it
was
an
applied
challenge,
in
fact
the
ninth
circuit
itself
struck
it
facially.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
narrowed
the
description
of
what
it
did.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
permanent
resident
aliens.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well...
well,
is
that
rational
basis
review
the
one
we
would
employ
in
reviewing
legislation
passed
by
congress
concerning
immigration
policy?
and
have
we
applied
a
more
circumscribed
review
over
the
means
of
effectuating
those
policies?
are...
are
there
separate
questions?
i
mean,
the
power
of
congress
to
pass
the
law
and
to
say
what
it
does
versus
the
implementation
of
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
rabinovitz,
do
you
have
a
response
to
the
jurisdiction
problem?
i
mean,
it's
possible
that
despite
the
government's
failure
to
raise
it,
that
we
could
do
so.
and
why
doesn't
section
1226
tell
the
courts
to
keep
hands
off?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
have
to
tell
you
i
don't
understand
it.
i
thought
maybe
you'd
enlighten
me
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean
the
first
degree
burglary
conviction--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
not
an
aggravated
felony?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
sounds
like
you're...
you're
still
seeking
some
kind
of
facial
invalidation
of
the
statute
rather
than
as
applied
to
your
client.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
you're
relying
on
a
conviction
of
someone
else
for
a
different
kind
of
a
crime.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
we
talking
about
this
person
as
an
as-applied
challenge,
or
do
we
have
a
facial
challenge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
are
talking
about
the
first
degree
burglary--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--not
entering
a
car
with
intent
to
commit
theft.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
but
not
in
this
case.
