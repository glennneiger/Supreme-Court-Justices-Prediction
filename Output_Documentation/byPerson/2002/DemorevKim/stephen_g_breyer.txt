justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
i
have
a
quick
answer
just
to...
you
said
a
facial
challenge.
i've
been
assuming
that
it's
a
challenge
brought
by
a
resident
alien
who
himself
has
a
plausible
claim
that
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
him
because
he's
saying
two...
you
know,
petty
theft
with
a...
petty
theft
with
a
prior
is
not...
doesn't
fall
within
the
category
of
crimes.
i
don't
know
if
that's
right
or
wrong,
but
shouldn't
i
consider
the
case
of
a
person
who
has
a...
an
arguable
claim
that
he's
outside
the
system?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
uses
those
words,
i
know.
i
just
don't
know
how
to
consider
it
that
way.
i
mean,
a
person
who
had
no
claim
whatsoever...
am
i
supposed
to
consider
it
on
the
basis
of
a
person
who
has...
well,
he
would
get
the
removal
order
entered
in
24
hours
if
he
had
no
claim
whatsoever.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
who
i'm
supposed
to
consider?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
somebody
like
the
plaintiff
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
can't
you
deal
with
that
problem
with
a
standard
that's
tough,
that's
different
from
having
the
hearing?
after
all,
we
give
bail
pending
appeal
to
criminals
who
have
been
convicted.
we
give
bail
to
alien
terrorists
who
are
about
to
be
deported.
why
couldn't
you
have
a
tough
standard
but,
nonetheless...
like
bail
pending
appeal,
but,
nonetheless,
give
the
bail
hearing
to
the
person
who's
willing
to
come
in
and
he'd
have
to
show,
you
know,
he's
not
going
to
run
away,
he's
not
a
danger,
and
he
has
a
good
issue
on
the
merits?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
there
was
a
tough
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
correct.
so
if,
in
fact,
i
have
a
good
claim,
i'm
let
out
on
bail
while
they're
considering
it?
