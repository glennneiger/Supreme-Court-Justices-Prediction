chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
01-1491,
charles
demore
versus
hyung
joon
kim.
general
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
in
the
quirin
case
where
the...
the
presidential
order
said
that
the
people
shall
have
no
access
to
the
courts
at
all,
this
court
sat
to
hear
whether
that
sort
of
a
provision
was
constitutional
or
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
about
this
particular
individual?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
general
olson.
ms.
rabinovitz,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can...
you
say
the
government
believes
it.
the
congress
believed
it,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
more
do
we
need?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
in...
in
this
case,
your...
your
client
was
convicted,
was
he
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
what
question
is
that?
does
congress
in
the
statute
set
forth
the
crimes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did...
did
you...
but
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
go
off
on
that
basis,
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
the...
the
government
answers
that
there's
a
substantial
number
of
people
who
don't
show
up
for
these
hearings,
and
that's
the
purpose
of
holding
them.
so
that
certainly
is
a
regulatory
purpose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you...
look...
look
at
the
immigration
cases.
look
at
carlson
against
landon.
i
mean,
that
certainly
was
a
class,
not
an
individual.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
who
has
the
legal
right
to
be
here,
although
he's
been
convicted
of
a
crime
which
makes
him
deportable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
could
a
first
degree
burglary
not
be
an
aggravated
felony?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
a
very
good
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but...
it's
not
just
a
question
of
being
a
burglary.
first
degree
burglary
usually
means
with...
with
people
present
and
on
the
premises.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
isn't
it
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
in
this
case.
first
degree
burglary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--justice
breyer's
classification
of
people
who
have
really
serious
claims
and
people
who
have
frivolous
claims...
surely
a
claim
that
first
degree
burglary
is
not
deportable
under
the
statute
would
verge
on
the
frivolous.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
there's
no
question
that
these
people
are
going
to
get
a
fair
hearing
eventually.
the
question
you're
challenging
is
whether
they
should
be...
be
incarcerated
pending
that
hearing.
so
we're
not
talking
about
a
fair
hearing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you...
you've
got
someone
who
is
an
alien
here.
the
alien
has
committed
a
felony.
i
mean,
it's
difficult
to...
for
me
to
say
that
they
should
have
all
these
additional
benefits
so
that
somehow
they
can
avoid
deportation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
with
the
case
we're
dealing
of
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
do
you...
what
do
you
mean,
misdemeanors
constitute
an
aggravated
felony?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
there's
no
question
that
first
degree
burglary
is
not
a
misdemeanor.
so,
in
our
case,
that's
not...
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
that,
do
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
rabinovitz.
mr.
olson,
general
olson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
01-1491
demore
against
kim.
section
1226
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
requires
the
attorney
general
to
take
into
custody
any
alien
who
is
removable
from
this
country
because
he
has
been
convicted
of
one
of
a
specified
set
of
crimes.
respondent
is
a
permanent
resident
alien
who
was
convicted
of
first
degree
burglary
and
petty
theft.
the
ins
charged
him
with
being
deportable
from
the
united
states
based
on
his
convictions
and
took
him
into
custody
under
section
1226(c).
respondent
agreed
that
he
was
subject
to
mandatory
detention
under
the
act,
but
he
filed
a
habeas
corpus
petition
challenging
the
claiming
that
it
violates
due
process
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
detain
him
without
an
individualized
hearing
to
determine
whether
he
is
a
danger
to
society
or
a
flight
risk.
the
district
court
agreed
and
granted
the
writ.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
there
are
two
parts
to
the
opinion:
the
does
first
part
is
that
this
court
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
question?
the
statute
of
at
issue
provides
that
no
court
may
set
aside
any
action
or
decision
by
the
attorney
general
under
1226.
respondent
challenges
not
a
decision
of
the
attorney
general,
but
rather
the
statutory
framework
that
permits
his
detention
without
bail.
becuase
the
statute
does
not
clearly
bar
habeas
corpus
review,
we
have
jurisdiction
to
review
this
case,
and
that
we
decide
by
a
vote
of
six
to
three.
on
the
merits
of
the
constitutionality
of
1226(c),
we
decide
by
a
vote
of
five
to
four
that
it
is
constitutional.
congress
enacted
1226
in
the
light
of
evidence
showing
that
deportable
criminal
aliens,
were
not
detained,
continued
to
engage
in
crime
and
failed
to
appear
for
their
removal
hearings
in
large
numbers.
we
have
held
before
that
in
the
exercise
of
its
broad
power
over
naturalization
and
immigration.
congress
may
make
rules
as
to
aliens
that
would
be
unacceptable
of
applied
to
citizens.
we
also
have
held
the
detention
during
the
deportation
proceedings
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
deportation
process.
respondent
in
arguing
that
his
detention
under
1226(c)
is
unconstitutional,
relies
heavily
upon
our
decision
two
years
ago
in
zadvydas
against
davis,
in
which
we
held
the
detention
beyond
the
90-day
removal
period
for
an
alien
ordered
removed
was
permissible
for
only
such
time
it
is
reasonably
necessary
to
secure
the
aliens'
removal.
zadvydas
is
materially
different,
however,
from
the
present
case.
first,
the
aliens
in
that
case
were
once
for
whom
removal
was
no
longer
practically
obtainable
such
that
their
detention
did
not
serve
its
proported
immigration
purpose.
in
contrast,
because
1226(c)
authorizes
detention
of
aliens
pending
their
removal
proceedings,
the
detention
necessarily
serves
the
purpose
of
preventing
aliens
from
fleeing
before
such
proceeding;
second,
while
the
period
of
detention
at
issue
in
zadvydas
was
indefinite
and
potentially
permanent.
the
record
shows
that
1226(c)
detention
not
only
has
a
definite
termination
point,
but
it
lasts
in
a
majority
of
cases
for
less
than
90
days
as
which
the
court
considered
in
zadvydas.
so
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
scalia
and
thomas
have
joined.
