unknown
speaker
i
had
the
same
question.
it's
at
6a
of
the
petition
for
the
appendix.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
paragraph
at
the
bottom
of
6a,
says
we
stop
short
of
affirming
the
holding
that
it's
facially
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
we
affirm
the
grant
of
habeas
corpus
on
the
ground
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
him
in
his
status
as
a
lawful
permanent
resident
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
sort
of
half-facial.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mostly
facial.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but,
general
olson,
those
statistics
go
to
the
likelihood
of
entry
of
the
order
of
deportation,
not
of
the
likelihood
of
flight
which
this
statute
is
directed
at.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
the
statistics...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
as
to
the
likelihood
of
showing
up
at
the
hearing
itself,
which
this
statute
protects,
80
percent
of
the
people
do
show
up.
unknown
speaker
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
grant
that--
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
there
could--
--isn't
he
able
to
challenge
those
points?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
those
points
can
be
challenged.
i
thought
he
can
get
a
hearing
as
to
those
points.
unknown
speaker
we're
only
talking
about
people
as
to
whom
it's
acknowledged
that
they
committed
the
crime,
it's
acknowledged
that
they're
deportable.
and
the
only
reason
they
may
not
get
deported
is
the
attorney
general
might
exercise
discretion
to
let
them
into
the
country.
unknown
speaker
you
can
take
it
to
court.
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
a
claim,
you're
let
out
on
bail
while
they
consider
the
claim?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
given--
unknown
speaker
--given
that,
general
olson,
that
we're
only
talking
about
people
who
have
acknowledged...
you
know,
who
have
no
claim
that
they
didn't
commit
the
crime,
who
have
no
claim
that
they
are
not
deportable,
why
do
we
have
to
rely
upon
whether
80
percent
of
them
will
flee
or
90
percent,
or
even...
you
know,
or
none
of
them
will
flee?
why
is
it...
does
the
government
concede
that
it's
unreasonable
to
say,
look,
somebody
who
has
no
right
to
be
at
large
in
this
country...
he's
here
illegally,
has
no
right
to
be
at
large.
and
besides
that,
on
top
of
that,
he's
already
committed
a
crime
in
this
country.
he
should
leave
the
country,
and
we're
going
to
hold
him
in
custody
until
he
leaves.
if
he
wants
to
fight
that...
that
departure,
that's
fine,
but
he
will
be
in
custody
until
he
departs.
what
is...
what
is
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you're...
you're
fighting
it
on
the...
on
the
ground
that
somehow
we
have
to
prove--
unknown
speaker
--that
a
large
number
of
them
will
flee.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
even
if
none
of
them
would
flee,
if
they
have
no
right
to
be
here,
if
they've
committed
a
crime,
why
cannot...
they
cannot
be
held
in...
in
custody
until
they
leave?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
for
the
class
that
we're
talking
about,
it's
rather
artificial
to
talk
about
lawful
resident
aliens
because
they
can
get
a
hearing
on
whether
their
continuing
residence
is
lawful.
they...
they
are
determined
to
be
deportable.
they
are
no
longer
lawful
resident
aliens.
unknown
speaker
well,
general
olson,
aren't
they
lawful
resident
aliens
until
an
order
is
entered
that
they
be
deported?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
at
the...
at
the
point
of
the...
we'll
call
it
the
preliminary
hearing,
the
joseph
hearing,
when
they
can
bring
these
challenges,
there
is
no
order
that
they
be
deported,
and
they,
therefore,
have
got
to
be
considered,
as
i
understand
it,
as
lawful
resident
aliens.
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
how
could
that
language
not
repeal
habeas
jurisdiction?
no
court
may
set
aside
any
action
by
the
attorney
general
under
this
section.
how
can...
how
can
that...
i
mean,
what
can
you
do
in
habeas
corpus
unless
you're
setting
aside
action
by
the
attorney
general
under
this
section?
how
can
that
possibly
not
set
aside
habeas
corpus?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
now,
maybe
you
want
to
argue
it's
unconstitutional,
but
gee,
to
say
that
it
doesn't
do
this
is...
i
mean,
it's...
it's
incredible.
well,
the
court
in
st.
cyr,
with
which
both
justice
scalia
and
i
disagreed,
said
something
very
much
like
that,
didn't
it,
that
you
had
to
be
very
specific
if
you
were
going
to
repeal
habeas
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
so
are
you
going
to...
are
you
going
to
defend
the
ninth
circuit's
basis
here?
unknown
speaker
now,
ms.
rabinovitz,
i
had...
i
had
understood
from
general
olson...
and
please,
you
know,
if
it's
wrong,
i...
i
want
to
know
it...
that...
that
your
client
could
get
a
hearing
on
that
particular
issue,
whether
the
crime
he's
being...
he
has
been
convicted
of
is
one
of
the
crimes
that
entails
deportation.
is...
is
not
true
that
he
can...
that
he
gets
a
hearing
on
that?
unknown
speaker
individualized
hearing.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
it's
a
hearing
that
says
you
were
convicted
of
x
or
you
weren't
convicted
of
x.
it's
not
a
hearing
that
says
that
x
renders
you
deportable.
is
that
the
point?
unknown
speaker
so
it--
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
clear
he's
been
convicted.
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
seventh...
seventh
circuit
might
have
been
wrong.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i...
i
note
that
you
have
redefined
substantial
question
as
non-frivolous.
anything
that's
not
sanctionable
raises
a
substantial
question
for
purposes
of...
of
this
new
rule?
unknown
speaker
wow.
unknown
speaker
that...
that
is
true
but
all--
unknown
speaker
--all
of...
at
least
for
people
who
have
committed
their
crimes
after
this
statute
was
enacted,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
on
notice.
if
you
get
convicted
of
a
felony,
your...
your
welcome
in
this
country
is
at
an
end
if
it's
an
aggravated
felony,
and
you
will
be
held
until
it
is...
it
is
finally
determined
whether
that
is,
indeed,
an
aggravated
felony
or
not.
i
don't
know
that
that's
terribly
unfair.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
doesn't.
it...
it's
just
one
of
the
risks
you
take
when
you
commit
a
felony.
your...
it's...
it's
part
of...
of
the
condition
of
your
admittance
to
this
country.
once
this
statute
is
passed,
any
lawful
resident
alien
knows
that
if
he
commits
a
felony
and
it's
an
aggravated
felony,
he
will
be
deported.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
until
the
question
of
whether
it
is
an
aggravated
felony,
assuming
it's
at
least
arguable,
is
decided,
he
will
be
held
in
custody
and
not
permitted
to
be
at
large
in
this
country.
now,
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
terribly
unreasonable.
just
don't
do
the
felony.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
agree
that
the
alien
has
the
burden
of
showing
that?
unknown
speaker
in
your...
in
your
regime,
you
would...
would
there
be
any
problem
putting
the
burden
on
the
alien
to
show
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i...
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
but
insofar
as
the
substantiality
or...
or
the
likelihood
of
prevailing...
forget
about
flight
risk
for
a
moment.
insofar
as
the
likelihood
of
prevailing
and
the
substantiality
of
the...
of
the
issue,
that's
almost
what
the
statute
already
provides
for
in
a
bail
determination
hearing,
as
set
forth
on
page
26
of
the
government's
brief.
a
person
in
ins
custody
is...
is
entitled
to
a
bond
determination
hearing.
and
the
standard
is
whether
or
not
the
government
is...
he
has
to
show
the
government
is
substantially
unlikely
to
prevail.
that's
very...
forget
flight
risk
for
a
moment.
that
is
very
close
to
the
regime
that
you
propose.
so
i
don't
see
what
we're
arguing
about
here
as
to
that.
now,
if
you
want
to
say
that
you're
entitled
to
release
if
you're
not
a
flight
risk,
that's
something
quite
different.
and
i
would...
and
i
would
doubt
the
latter,
but--
unknown
speaker
--well,
perhaps
that's
why
i
asked
you
that
question
first.
it...
it
does
seem
to
me
that
if
you
concede
that
he
has
the
burden,
that
that
is
really
very,
very
close
to
what
the...
the
statute
already
provides,
forgetting
about
flight
risk
for
the
moment,
or...
or--
unknown
speaker
general
olson,
i
don't
want
to
intrude
upon
your
rebuttal
time,
but
i
have
one
question
that's
very
important
for
me
and
you
can
answer
it
yes
or
no.
assuming
i
disagree
with
you
as
to
the
reading
of
the
statute
as
to
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
if
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
is
that
provision
of
the
statute
in
the
view
of
the
government
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
rely
on
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
if
you
haven't
briefed
it.
[laughter]
