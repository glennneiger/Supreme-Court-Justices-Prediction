justice
antonin
scalia
general
olson,
do...
do
we
have
authority
to
entertain
this
challenge?
as
you
know,
an
amicus
has
raised
a
jurisdictional
question,
and
i
think
did
it
maybe
in
the
court
of
appeals
stage
as
well.
it
certainly
did
it
early
on
here.
the
problem
is
section
1126(e)
which
says,
no
court
may
set
aside
any
action
or
decision
by
the
attorney
general
under
this
section
regarding
the
detention
or
release
of
any
alien
or
the
grant,
revocation,
or
denial
of
bond
or
parole.
now,
is
that
provision,
number
one,
inapplicable
or,
number
two,
unconstitutional?
and
if
neither
of
those,
why
doesn't
it
mean
that
we
have
no
authority
to
entertain
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it
doesn't...
doesn't
say
the
challenge...
no.
it
says,
no
court
may
set
aside
any
action
by
the
attorney
general.
and...
and
what
is
asked
for
here
is
that
we
set
aside
the
attorney
general's
action
in
detailing...
in
detaining
this
alien.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
you're
relying
on
what
language
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
but
all
of
those
other
statutes
had
some
wiggle
room
i
think,
even
st.
cyr,
and
there
just
is
no
wiggle
room
here.
it
doesn't
refer
to
judicial
review.
it
simply
says,
no
court
may
set
aside
any
action
by
the
attorney
general
under
this
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
appreciate
your
carefully
examining
it,
but
i'd
still
like
to
know
what
language
in
it
leads
your
careful
examination
to
conclude
that
it
does
not
cover
this
case.
i
mean,
if
it's
unconstitutional,
that's
another
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
we'll
strike
it
down
for
that
reason.
but
my
goodness--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
refer
to
the
issue.
it
doesn't
refer
to
the
basis
on
which
the
setting
aside
is
done.
it
doesn't
say,
may
set
aside,
you
know,
on
grounds
other
than...
it
doesn't
even
refer
to
the
basis.
it
says,
no
court
may
set
aside
any
action
by
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
eight
out
of
10
of
these
criminals
show
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
very
comforting.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
can
get
a
hearing
on
whether
they
are
lawful
resident
aliens.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
they?
in
effect,
they
can
get
a
hearing
on
whether
they
are
lawful
resident
aliens.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
you're
not
asking
just
for
individualized
hearings
on
those
items,
are
you?
you're...
you're
not
just
asking
for
individualized
hearings
on
whether
you
are
the
person
that
did
the...
that...
that
was
convicted
and
whether
the...
the
crime
of
conviction
causes
you
to
be
deportable.
you
want
a
hearing
on
whether,
if
you
are
let
go,
you
will
show
up
for...
for
a
later
hearing.
and
i
don't
see
why...
why
that
is
necessary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
long...
so
long
as
you
get
a
hearing
on
those
other
substantive
points,
it
seems
to
me
the
government
ought
to
be
able
to
hold
you,
an
alien
who
has
no
right
to
be
at
large
in
this
country,
until
you
leave.
