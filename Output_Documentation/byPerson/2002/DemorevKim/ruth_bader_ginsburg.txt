general
olson,
didn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--didn't
the
ninth
circuit
narrow
the
group
somewhat?
i
thought
that
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
said
the
whole
thing
falls.
i
thought
the
ninth
circuit
said
only
as
to
lawfully
admitted...
what
was
it?
lawful
permanent
residents.
and
so
that
was
not
taking
the
whole
thing
at
its
face,
but
only
a
part
of
the
total
group.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
get
to...
to
zadvydas
and
the
distinction,
you...
you
make,
i
take
it,
no
distinction
between
lawful
permanent
residents
and
people
who
are
excludable.
people
who
are
lawful
permanent
residents
have
many
rights
in
common
with
citizens.
indeed,
this
court
once
said
that
they
were
a
suspect
classification.
but
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
you're
making
no
distinction
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
might
be
of
a
crime
that
they...
one
of
the
claims
here
is
that
this
is
not
a
qualifying
plot...
crime.
i
don't
get
into
that
box.
now
that
may
be
wrong
or
right,
but
suppose...
on
your
reading,
or
under
this
statute,
someone
would
not
be
able
to
get
bail
despite
a
good
claim
that
they
are
counting
a
crime
that
doesn't
qualify
as
one
of
these
serious
offenses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
aren't
there
one-and-a-half
or...
there's
this
joseph
hearing.
it's
not
just
that
either
you
have
a
hearing
or
you
don't
have
a
hearing.
you
have
the
hearing
that
justice
souter
was
referring
to
where
your
burden
is
enormous
because
you
will
not
succeed
at
that
hearing
if
you
show
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
this
crime
is...
doesn't
qualify
as
serious.
you
have
to
show
overwhelmingly
that
the
government
will
win
on
that
issue
in
it.
so...
but
there
is
something
other
than...
there's
this
joseph
hearing,
which
you
say
is
not
adequate,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ms.
rabinovitz,
why
wasn't
judge
fletcher
absolutely
right
in
rejecting
that
claim?
because
the
language
is
when
the
alien
is
released
from
criminal
custody.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
statute
directs
custody
when
the
alien
is
released
from
criminal
custody,
and
not
at
some
later
time,
not
at
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
a
removal
order.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
still,
if
the
statute
says
when
released
from
criminal
custody,
even
before
release,
but
it
doesn't
say
at
the
later
time
of
the
final
removal
order.
