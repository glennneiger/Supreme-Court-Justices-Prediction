yes,
but
general,
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
there
are
people
in
the
class
who
might
have
been
convicted
even
before
the
statute
was
passed.
so
you're
not
just...
just
continuing
detention.
you
have
to
go
out
and
find
them
and...
and
put
them
under
detention.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but,
general
olson,
i
wish
you
would
answer
this
question.
it's
very
important
to
understand
the...
the
government's
position
on
it.
we're
focusing
on
the
percentage
who
show
up
for
the
hearing.
am
i...
and
that's
correct.
that's
what
this
statute
is
directed
at.
and
am
i
not
correct
that
80
percent
of
the
aliens
in
the
class
did
show
up
for
the
hearing
without
being
detained?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
statute
doesn't...
the
statute
is
not
directed
at
the
consequences
after
the
deportation
order
has
been
entered.
am
i
not
right
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i'm
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
he's
at
the
hearing,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
you
say,
lock
this
guy
up.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
this
statute
is
not
directed
at
the
time
during
potential
appeal.
it's
directed
at
the...
as
i
understand
it...
now,
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
the
statute,
it's
directed
at
the
time
before
the
hearing
starts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
why
can't
the
immigration
judge
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
say,
a,
you're
going
to
be
removed,
and
b,
you...
you
go
in
the
clink
until
your...
you
go
away?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
general
olson,
you
don't
necessarily
lose
them.
all
you're
being
asked
to
do
is
to
have
an
individualized
hearing
as
to
each
member
of
that
20
percent.
