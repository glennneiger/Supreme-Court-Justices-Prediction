ms.
judy
rabinovitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
authorized
and,
if
so,
whether
the
due
process
clause
permits
a
statute
that
requires
that
lawful
permanent
residents
like
our
client
be
imprisoned
throughout
the
duration
of
removal
proceedings.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
yes,
your
honor.
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
explanation
for
why
this
court
did
not--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--this...
this
statute
contains
no
express
language
that
repeals
habeas
jurisdiction.
that's
one
answer
that
i
could
give
you,
your
honor,
and
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
st.
cyr
and
calcano,
absent
that...
that
language,
the
habeas...
there's
still
jurisdiction
in--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--but
this
court
has
said--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--yes.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
the
point
is
that
this
statute
requires
the
government
to
detain
individuals
like
our
client
who
are
lawful
permanent
residents
not
because
their
detention
is
necessary
to
protect
the
public
from
danger
of
flight
risk,
but
merely
because
they
were
convicted
in
the
past
for
one
of
a
broad
range
of
crimes
that
the
government
believes
may
render
them
deportable.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
well,
your
honor,
the
question
that
remains
to
be
determined
in
all
these
cases
is
whether
an
individual
is,
in
fact,
deportable.
congress
did
decide
that
certain
kinds
of
crimes
should
render
an
individual
deportable
and
these
individuals
have
been
convicted
of
crimes.
but
the
fact--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--the
fact
that
they've
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
mr.
chief
justice,
doesn't
mean
that
it's
a
crime
that
renders
them
deportable
under
the
statute.
and
i
think
that
this
addresses,
in
part,
justice
kennedy's
question
about
have
they
been...
is
this
just
that
they're
suspected
of
committing
crimes
or
have
they
been
convicted
of
crimes.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
yes,
mr.
chief
justice--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--he
was
convicted,
but
there
still
is
a
question
about
whether
his
conviction
actually
renders
him
deportable.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
no,
your
honor.
congress
sets
forth
a...
a
broad
category
of
crimes
that
can
render
somebody
deportable,
and
one
of
those
is...
is
a
broad
category
that
are
labeled
aggravated
felonies.
the
question,
though...
and
this
is
a
question
that
has
been
very
hotly
litigated
in
the
courts...
is
whether
a
conviction
is
an
aggravated
felony.
and
in
this
case,
that
question
is
especially
relevant
because
in
our
client's
case,
the
conviction
that
he
was--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--no,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--we're
defending
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling,
your
honor.
i'm...
i'm
just
explaining
that
this
issue
about
whether
somebody
is
deportable
is
an
open
issue,
and
that's
precisely
what
the...
that's
precisely
what
a
deportation
proceeding
is
to
determine.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
he
gets
a
hearing--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--he
gets
a
hearing,
your
honor,
but
it's
a
very
limited
hearing
to
the
extent
that
that
hearing
does
not
determine
that
he
has,
in
fact,
been
convicted
of
a
crime
that
renders
him
deportable.
all
that
it--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--yes,
although,
your
honor,
it
does
say
that
the
government
is
not
substantially
unlikely
to
prevail
on
its
charge,
so...
that
you
are
deportable.
so...
and
essentially
it--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--it
says
that
there
is
reason...
there's
a
possibility.
it's
not
impossible
that
you
will
be
found
deportable.
you...
that
it's
not...
since
the
government
is
not
substantially
unlikely
to
prevail
on
the
charge.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
there
are
many
individuals
who
are
subjected
to
mandatory
detention
under
this
statute
who
cannot
satisfy
that
standard.
in
fact,
that
that...
they've
had
that
hearing
and
the
court
has
held
the
government
substantially...
you
know,
we
can't
show
that
the
government
is
substantially
unlikely
to
prevail.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
no--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--no,
your
honor.
you're
absolutely
right.
we
are
talking
about
the
second
category
of
cases.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
yes,
your
honor.
it's
exactly--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--yes--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--let
me
try...
let
me
try
to
explain
how
the
statute
works
and
why
we
believe
that
it's
a
problem.
the...
the
proceeding
that
you're
asking
for,
a
determination
about
whether,
in
fact,
an
individual
is
deportable,
is
precisely
what
a
deportation
hearing
is
for,
and
that
kind
of
decision
is
not
made
the
first
time
you
come
before
an
immigration
judge.
it's
often
a
very
protracted
process,
and
we
have
individuals
who
have...
who
have
been
in
jail
for
17
months
pending
an
immigration
judge
hearing
to
determine
that
exact
question,
justice
scalia,
about
whether
they
are,
in
fact,
deportable,
which
is
why
we
say
that
the
relevant
question
is
whether
pending
those
proceedings,
there's
a
regulatory
purpose
in
detaining
that
individual.
and
we're
not--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
a
regulatory
purpose.
but
this
court
looks
to
the
regulatory
purpose
in
an
individual's
case
when
you're
talking
about
depriving
somebody
of
a
significant
liberty
interest,
which
is
what's
here.
we
don't
allow
people
to
be
locked
up
based
on
averages.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
no,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
respectfully...
i
read
carlson
differently.
in
carlson,
what
this
court
did
is
it
upheld
the
attorney
general's
discretionary
decision
that
five
individuals
could
be
detained
because
there
was...
that...
the
decision
to
detain
them
was
with
not...
was
not
without
reasonable
foundation.
it
was
a
discretionary
decision.
it's
wholly
different
from
this
case.
what
makes
this
statute
so
unique
and
so
unprecedented
is
that
the
government
is
prohibited.
there's
no
discretion
here.
the
attorney
general
is
prohibited
from
releasing
individuals
like
our
client,
a
lawful
permanent
resident
who
has
a
legal
right
to
be
here,
even
when--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--no,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
not
clear
that
this
conviction
makes
him
deportable.
in
fact--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--he's
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
but
it's
not
clear
that
this
conviction
renders
him
deportable.
that's
precisely
what
a
deportation
proceeding
is
for.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
both--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--not
necessarily,
your
honor.
that
remains
to
be
determined,
but--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--that's
a
good
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
but...
but...
yes.
but
let
me
point
out...
i
refer
you
to
the...
the
amicus
brief
for...
by
citizens
and...
and
immigrants
for
equal
justice.
it's
one
of
these
green
briefs.
and
it's
on
page
12
of
their
brief.
they
referred
to
a
case,
the
solorzano-patlan
case,
where
an
individual
was
convicted
of
entering
an
automobile
with
intent
to
commit
theft,
and
the
board
of
immigration
of
appeals
said...
or
the...
the...
excuse
me.
the
immigration
judge
said
exactly
what...
what
you
have
said,
which
is
that
how
could
this
crime
not
be
an
aggravated
felony?
it's
a
burglary,
entering
an
automobile
with
intent
to
commit
theft.
one-and-a-half
years
after
our
client...
after
this
person...
excuse
me...
he
wasn't
our
client...
was
detained,
the
seventh
circuit
disagreed.
despite
what
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
said
that
how
could
this
crime
not
be
a
burglary--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--mr.
chief
justice--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--that's
a
good
point,
your
honor,
but
the
government
did
not
petition
for
cert
in
that
case.
and...
and
the
point
that
i
want
to
make--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--no,
your
honor,
we're
not
seeking--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--no.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
your
honor,
this
is
definitely
an
as-applied
challenge,
and
i
refer
you
to
page--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--yes,
we
are.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
right,
right.
my
point
with
raising
that
example
was
just
to
point
out
that
the
question
of
what
constitutes
an
aggravated
felony
is
very
contested.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
oh,
it...
it
certainly
is.
it
remains
a
question
about
whether
this
is
an
aggravated
felony--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--because
you
need
to
look
at
the
precise--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
need
to...
to
disagree
with
you.
it's
unclear.
to
decide
whether
this
is...
is
an
aggravated
felony,
the
court
is
going
to
need
to
look
at
the
specific
language
of
the
statute.
the...
the
specific
crime
that
our
client
committed
was
he
broke
and
entered
into
a
tool
shed
and
he
was
convicted
under
california
state
law.
this
is
a
very
complicated,
technical
area
of
the
law.
and
all
that
i
can
tell
you
is
that
if
you
refer
to
our
brief
at
page
5,
note
6...
oh,
no.
excuse
me.
that's
not
the
place.
to
our
brief
at...
our
brief
at
page
30,
note
27,
we
note
numerous
examples
where
the
question
of
whether
something
is
an
aggravated
felony
has
been
contested
and
decided--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--right.
right.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
in
this
case,
if
we're
talking
about
somebody
who
raises
a
non-frivolous
challenge
like
our
client,
that
would
satisfy
this
case
because
this
is--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--your
honor,
i
misspoke.
what
i
meant
is
that
in
this
case,
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge.
it's
a...
it's
a
challenge
about
whether
this
statute
as
applied
to
our
client
who's
a
lawful
permanent
resident,
who
has
bona
fide
challenges
that
he
is
not
deportable
and
is
eligible
for
relief
from
deportation,
that
in
this
case,
applying
the
statute
to
him
is
unconstitutional.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
i
would
argue
for
that
opinion
in
this
case
because
it
would
resolve
this
case.
i
believe
that
there
also
might
be...
there
would
be
a
constitutional
issue
that
even
somebody
else...
due
process
requires
that
they
have
an
opportunity
to
show
that
they're
not
a
danger
and
a
flight
risk
because
that
is
the
purpose
of
regulatory
detention.
and
as
the--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--yes,
your
honor--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--and...
and
it
has
to
be
that
way
because
there
are
so
many
examples
of
circuit
courts
finding
that
the
board's
decision
about
what
constitutes
a
deportable
offense
is
wrong
and
yet,
that
those
were
cases
where
the
individual
could...
where
their...
their
claim
might
have
been
considered
bordering
on
the
frivolous,
even
though
it
wasn't.
and
let
give
you
a
very--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--let
me
give
you
an
example.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
but
your
question
presupposes
the
answer.
you're
saying--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--two
points.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
well,
two
points,
your
honor.
first,
in
this
case,
the
conviction
that
is
now
being
considered
as
possibly
an
aggravated
felony
was
committed
before
the
statute
took
effect.
so
even
under
your
honor's
proposal,
the
statute
could
not
apply
to
him.
in
terms
of
what
you're
suggesting,
though,
if
congress
was
to
say
that
anybody
who...
there
still
is
an
issue
of
whether
somebody
is,
in
fact,
deportable,
and
to
condition...
and...
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
individuals
who
are
facing
deportation,
particularly
lawful
permanent
residents,
have
a
right
to
a
fair
hearing.
to
say
that
those
individuals
must
give
up
their
right
to
physical
liberty--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--you're
right,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the...
the
point
is
that
if
somebody
is
locked
up
for
a
year-and-a-half,
and
they
can't
get
the
evidence
for
their
case,
because
being
locked
up
in
jails
also
makes
it
much
harder
for
people
to
present
their
cases,
there's
no
right
to
appointed
counsel.
it
means
they
can't
work.
there
are...
and
this
is,
again,
where
i
would
like
to
refer
you,
just
in
general,
to
the
amicus
brief
by
the
citizens
and
immigrants
for
equal
justice
which
points
out
other
cases
where
individuals
gave
up
their
claims
because
otherwise
they
were
going
to
be
in
detention
for
so
long.
and
let
me
just
point
out
one
other--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--well...
well,
first
of
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
this...
it's
not
only
for
people
who
are
convicted
of
felonies.
even
the
definition--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--okay,
but
the...
the
question
is
what...
what
constitutes
an
aggravated
felony.
misdemeanors
constitute
an
aggravated
felony
as
well.
you're
right.
in
this
case,
the
initial
conviction--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--i
know
it's
somewhat
shocking,
mr.
chief
justice,
but,
in
fact,
the
way
that
aggravated
felony
has
been
defined
so
broadly--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--the
courts
have
held
that
even
misdemeanors
can
be
aggravated
felonies.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
but
let
me
return
to
the
point
about
whether
it's...
whether
due
process
is
satisfied
by
requiring
that
somebody
be
mandatorily
detained
throughout
the
process
of
their
deportation
proceeding,
a
process
which,
as
i
said,
can
be
months,
often
years,
without
any
individualized
determination
of
danger
and
flight
risk.
and
the
example
that
i
wanted
to
give
ties
back
with
this
court's
decision
in
st.
cyr,
which
said
that
212(c)
relief
was
available
to
individuals
whose
convictions...
who
had
pled
guilty
prior
to...
to
the
statute
having
taken
effect.
all
of
those
individuals
were
subject
to
mandatory
detention
under
the
statute.
their
claim
would
have
been
considered
close
to
frivolous
until
the
supreme
court
ruled
differently.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
your
honor,
that's--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--your
honor,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
factors
that
the
immigration
service
and
the
immigration
judge
looks
at
when
they
make
a
determination
whether
somebody
should
be
released
on
bond.
they...
when
they're
determining
flight
risk,
that's
precisely
what
they
look
at.
they
say,
oh,
this
is
a
frivolous...
this
is
a
frivolous
claim.
we're
not
going
to
release
this
person
on
bond
because
they're
not
going
to
show
up.
and
we're
not
saying
that
individuals
in
that
situation
should
be
released
from
detention.
all
that
we're
saying
is
that
an
individual
needs
to
be
given
some
opportunity
to
demonstrate,
look,
i
was
convicted
of
this
crime,
but
i
have
claims
for
relief.
i'm
not
a
flight
risk.
i'm
not
a
danger.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
and
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--your
honor,
we
have
no--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--we
have
no
problem
with
congress
creating
a
presumption
that
individuals
who
are
charged
with
these
kinds
of...
with
being
deportable
for
these
kinds
of
crimes
are
a
danger
and
are
a
flight
risk,
and
that
they
need
to
come
forward
to
show
that
they're
not.
and
in
fact--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--let
me
try
to
clarify
what
i
believe
is
some
confusion
about
what
that
hearing
does.
the
hearing
essentially
just
shows
you
need
to
show
that
the
government
has
no
frivolous
claim.
that's
essentially
what
you
need
to
show.
i
mean,
you
have
to
show
that
the
government
had...
that
the
government's
charge
is
frivolous.
and
i
would
assume
that
the
government
is
not
putting
people
into
proceedings
if
they
have
no
possible
argument.
but
to
require
that
an
individual
be
locked
up
throughout
the
whole
deportation
process
just
because
they
cannot
show
that
the
government
has
a...
has
a
frivolous
claim,
that
doesn't
satisfy
due
process.
in
terms
of
burden,
your
honor,
what
i
was
referring
to...
what
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
is
whether
an
individual
is
going
to
have
an
obligation
to
show
that
they're
not
a
danger
of
flight
risk.
but
even--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--yes,
your
honor.
i
don't...
i
don't
see
it
that
way.
i
see
that
the
question
about
if
you
need...
if
an
individual
has
to
prove
that
the
government's
argument
is
frivolous,
that's
not
the
same
thing
as
showing
that
you
have
a
non-frivolous
claim.
and
that's
all
that
we're
saying.
i
think
that
they're
completely
different.
one
is
showing
that
the
government's
argument
is
frivolous.
i
don't...
most
of
the
cases
where
individuals
were
found
not
deportable,
it
wasn't
that
the
government's
claim
was
frivolous,
but
those
individuals
prevailed
in
their
proceedings.
and
that's
the
issue
here,
whether...
whether
an
individual
can
be
detained
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
without
any
opportunity
to
show
that...
that
there's
no
purpose
that's
served
by
their
detention.
and
i
think
that...
that
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
because
in
this
case,
once
the
district
court...
our
client
was
detained
for
6
months
without
any
individualized
determination.
the
district
court
then
said
due
process
requires
an
individualized
determination,
and
the
ins,
the
immigration
service,
on
its
own
decided
he
poses
no
danger
and
he
can
be
released
on
5,000-dollar
bond.
and
he's
been
out
for
the
past
3-and-a-half
years.
he's
now
getting
his
college
degree.
he's
working.
if
the
government
prevails
in
this
appeal,
it
will
have
no
choice
but
to
re-incarcerate
him
throughout
his
proceedings.
it's
not
a
question
of
discretion
like
carlson,
where
they
can
make
that
determination.
and
going
back
to
your
question
about
burden,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
regime
that
was
in
place
prior
to
this
statute,
and
that
is
now
in
place
in
those
circuits
where
they've
said
that
the
statute
needs
to
be
interpreted
to...
or
that
the
statute...
due
process
requires
an
individualized
determination,
still
requires
that
an
individual
show
that
they
are
not
a
danger
of
flight
risk.
they
bear
that
burden.
and
so
under
this
system,
no
individual
who's
a
danger
of
flight
risk
is
going
to
be
released
except
for
those
cases
where
there's,
you
know,
obviously
going
to
be
error.
but
in
general,
individuals
who
are
a
danger
of
flight
risk
aren't
going
to
be
released.
i
think
it...
there's
one
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
because
i
realize
my
time
is
short,
which
is
that
this
case
poses
a
serious
constitutional
problem,
and
we
believe
that
there
is
a
way
that
this
court
can
avoid
that
problem
by
construing
the
statute
to
not
apply
to
individuals
like
our
client
who
are,
in
fact,
not
deportable.
the
statute
says
that
individuals
shall
be
mandatorily
detained.
an
individual
who
is
deportable
on
one
of
these
grounds
is
subject
to
mandatory
detention.
as
we've
been
talking
about
here,
in
fact,
the
question
of
whether
he
is
deportable
remains
very
much
to
be
decided.
he
doesn't
have
any
order
of
deportation.
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
because--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--because
i
think
that
what
judge
fletcher
was
not
aware
of
is
that
the
whole
regime
right
now
that
the
immigration
service
has
is
to
conduct
deportation
proceedings
while
individuals
are
still
serving
their
criminal
sentence,
which
makes
complete
sense,
because
then
you
do
not
have
this
problem.
people
are
already
ordered
deported,
determined
deportable
while
they
are
still
in
jail.
and
so
the--
ms.
judy
rabinovitz
--there's
two
different
issues,
justice
ginsburg.
one
is
when...
is
deportable.
it
says,
when
released.
our
point
is
only
that
there
are
individuals
who
have
deportation
proceedings
while
they're
in
prison,
and
there
will
be
an
immigration
judge
decision
or
a
bia
decision
that
says
they
are
deportable.
now,
they
may
still
be
seeking
review
of
that
decision
in
the
federal
courts,
in
which
case,
that
decision
is
not
final
and
they
would
not
fit
under
the
next
statute,
the
statute
that
you...
that
this
court
construed
in...
in
zadvydas,
which
was
1241,
but
they
would...
or
excuse
me...
1231.
but
they
would
still
have
an
order
of
deportation,
and
then,
that
would
be
a
way
to
say
that
individual
is
deportable.
whereas,
here
you
have
a
situation
where
anybody
who
the
government
charges
with
being
deportable...
in
this
case,
our
client,
even
though
he
may
not
actually
be
deportable...
is
subject
to
mandatory
detention
for
possibly
a
year,
2
years,
however
long.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
