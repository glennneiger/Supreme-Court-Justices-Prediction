justice
david
h.
souter
but
it...
but
it
struck
it
facially
only
with
respect
to
the
permanent
resident
aliens.
justice
david
h.
souter
general
olson,
you've...
you've
put
in
statistics
about
the
number
of...
of
aliens
who
don't
show
up
for
the
hearings
and
the...
the
rather
low
percentage
of
those
who
are
ultimately
deported
from
the
class
that
don't
show
up
and
so
on.
on
your
view
of
the
government's
authority
over...
over
aliens
and
the
deference
that
the
court
owes,
would
our...
in
your
judgment
should
our
decision
be
the
same
regardless
of
those
statistics?
if
you
had
told
us
nothing
about
the...
the
probabilities
of
catching
people,
should
we,
on
your
view,
or
would
we,
on
your
view,
be
obligated
to
defer
and
simply
say
it's
up
to
the
government?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
does...
is...
does
that...
do
your
statistics
define
that
category
as
the...
the
legal
permanent
resident
aliens
or
all
aliens?
i
think
it's
the
latter.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
it...
if
it
is
the
latter,
then
i
don't
know
that
the
statistics
tell
us
anything
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
legitimacy
of
the
ends,
i.e.,
the...
the
automatic
detention,
with...
with
respect
to
the
class
that
we've
got
under
consideration
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
they
include
all
aliens
and
not
just
the...
the
permanent
resident
aliens.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
presume
there
was
some,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
what
i...
what
i'm
worried...
i
see
that,
and
what
i'm
worried
about
on
the
other
side
of
it...
i'm...
i
can
see
also
how
you
could
limit
it
like
to
bail
pending
appeal,
a
tough
standard.
the
other
side
of
it
is
the
alien
who's
there
and
who's
the
wrong
person
or
the...
or
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
him
or
there's
a
crime
that
they
say
he
committed
which
he
didn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
try
johnson
v.
robson
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
mean,
i
have
a
reason.
i
mean,
now
i
am...
i'm
confused
on
this
and
i'd
appreciate
it.
i...
i
assume
there
is
someone
in
prison.
he's
detained
like
your
client.
there's
a
class
of
people.
there
are
two
subgroups.
group
1
is
a
group
that
has
no
non-frivolous
argument
that
they
shouldn't
be
deported.
it's
virtually
conceded
they're...
they
should
be
deported.
their
only
arguments
against
it
are
frivolous.
group
2
are
people
who
have
a
real
non-frivolous
argument...
a
real
non-frivolous
argument...
that
they
aren't...
it's
the
wrong
person,
this
crime
doesn't
fall
within
the
statutory
definition,
i
probably
will
get
asylum,
something
like
that.
they
have
a
real
non-frivolous
argument.
now,
i
thought
that
what
we
were
talking
about,
at
least
in
part,
was
that
people
in
this
group
2
were
being
held
without
bail.
now,
am
i
right?
because
i
think
what
i
heard
the
solicitor
general
say
is
i'm
wrong.
we're
only
talking
about
people
in
group
1.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
was
just,
i
think,
what
justice
scalia
was
concerned
about.
that's
just
what
i'm
concerned
about,
and
i'd
appreciate
some
elaboration
on
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you...
you
consider
whether
he
broke
into
an
inhabited
tool
shed,
i
guess,
to
be
not
within
the
statute,
and
the
other
side
thinks
it
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
your
opinion,
would...
would...
and
this
goes
back
to
my
initial
question
which
i'm
still...
haven't
heard
you
really
answer.
look,
on
appeal,
somebody
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
in
order
to
get
out
on...
on
appeal...
have
bail
on
appeal,
he
has
to
show
not
only
he
wouldn't
run
away,
not
only
he
isn't
a
danger,
but
also
that
he
raises
a
substantial
question.
now,
suppose
that
we
were
to
say
at
least
those
people
who
show
that
they
raise
a
substantial
question...
a
substantial
question...
and
it
says
not
for
purposes
of
delay...
that
as
to
those
people,
you
have
to
have
an
individualized
hearing.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not
saying
if
it'd
satisfy
the
case,
though
i
take
it
from
what
you
say
it
would
satisfy
you
and
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
to
keep
someone
in
prison
without
bail,
after
they've
been
convicted
of
something,
pending
a
deportation
order
is
not
constitutional
without
an
individualized
hearing
at
least
if...
or
don't
say
at
least...
if,
among
other
things,
he
shows
there
is
a
substantial
question
not
for
purposes
of
delay.
imagine
an
opinion
that
said
that.
would
you
argue
for
or
against
that
opinion?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's...
that's...
i
mean,
your
argument
to
me
rings
true
for
people
who
have
real
claims,
but
if
you're
trying
to
apply
it
to
a
person
who
has
an
insubstantial
claim
or
a
claim
that
is
interposed
for
purposes
of
delay,
i'm
tempted
to
say,
well,
there's
a
very
good
reason
to
keep
him
locked
up,
namely,
he
doesn't
have
any
argument
and
he's
about
to
be
deported
and...
and
if
he
wants
to
be
deported
quickly,
he
can
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
he
has
a
substantial
claim,
it's
different.
justice
david
h.
souter
four
of
us
are
in
dissenting
positions
this
morning.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
descending
opinion
on
grounds
of
statutory
construction
based
on
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
avoidance.
justice
stevens,
justice
ginsburg
and
i
are
dissenting
on
the
constitutional
issue
which
the
chief
justice
has
just
described.
the
respondent
kim
is
an
alien,
lawfully
admitted
to
permanent
residence
in
united
states,
also
known
as
the
holder
of
a
green
card.
although
the
government
seeks
to
remove
him
from
the
country,
he
remains
a
lawful
permanent
resident
unless
and
until
an
order
of
removal
is
entered.
it
is
not
clear
that
such
an
order
will
be
entered
since
he
is
challenging
the
removability
before
the
immigration
court
and
has
applied
for
withholding
of
removal.
accordingly,
kim's
constitutional
right
to
liberty
is
the
same
as
that
of
any
lawful
permanent
resident
and
the
right
to
be
free
from
physical
confinement
except
as
justified
under
the
fifth
amendment's
due
process
clause
applies
to
permanent
resident
aliens,
as
well
as
the
citizens
of
the
united
states.
determining
what
the
due
process
clause
requires
in
this
case
is
not
difficult.
the
fifth
amendment
protection
of
liberty
is
that
its
height
and
the
government
tries
to
incarcerate
an
individual.
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized,
we
have
repeatedly
held
it
before
the
government
may
lock
someone
up,
it
must
show
that
the
individual's
detention
is
necessary
to
a
compeling
government
purpose
or
interest.
we
have
applied
this
principle
in
the
context
to
pre
trial
detention,
civil
commitment
and
only
two
years
ago
in
a
case
called
zadvydas
to
which
the
chief
justice
referred
in
the
context
of
detention
of
aliens
ordered
deported
from
the
united
states.
in
each
of
these
cases,
we
held
that
continued
incarceration
depend
on
an
individualized
showing
of
necessity,
such
as
a
showing
of
the
detainee
posed
a
risk
of
flight
or
a
danger
to
others.
detention
of
lawful
residents
cannot
be
justified
on
a
categorical
basis
without
individualized
assessments.
the
due
process
cases
that
shield
two
minimum
requirements
that
must
be
satisfied
in
each
individual
case:
the
first
is
substantive,
the
individual's
detention
must
be
necessary
to
a
governmental
purpose;
the
second
is
procedural,
the
individual
must
at
least
be
given
the
opportunity
to
convince
an
impartial
decision
maker
that
his
detention
is
in
fact
unnecessary
despite
the
government's
contrary
assertion.
kim
here
fails
both
requirements.
substantively,
the
statute
does
not
require
the
government
even
to
assert
a
reason
to
detain
a
particular
lawful
resident
alien.
the
government
claims
that
the
statute
is
constitutional,
nonetheless,
on
the
ground
that
there
is
a
statistical
justification
for
class-wide
detention
once
a
charge
of
removability
has
been
brought,
but
the
government's
reliance
on
general
statistics
misses
the
mark
even
on
its
own
terms.
none
of
the
government
study
show
that
aliens
in
kim's
position
are
highly
likely
to
abscond
unless
detain.
in
one
recent
study
expressly
concluded
that
mandatory
detention
was
unnecessary
to
prevent
flight
by
aliens
like
kim
who
are
alegedly
removable
but
not
yet
ordered
removed.
kim's
own
case
makes
it
clear
that
there
is
no
reason
to
detain
him
at
all
and
neither
the
court
nor
the
government
contests
this
fact.
after
the
district
court
ended
its
judgment
in
this
case,
the
ins,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
without
even
holding
a
hearing
concluded
that
kim
could
be
released
on
bond
of
$5,000.
locking
someone
up
wihtout
even
a
claim
of
necessity
when
the
government
admits
that
he
can
be
safely
released
on
bond,
is
an
arbitrary
deprivation
of
liberty
that
violates
the
substantive
component
of
due
process.
procedurally,
the
only
hearing
available
for
aliens
in
kim's
position
is
a
so-called
joseph
hearing,
which
is
an
opportunity
to
show
that
the
government's
claim
of
removability
is
essentially
frivolous.
such
a
hearing
only
permits
kim
to
argue
that
he
is
not
within
the
statutory
category
of
people
subject
to
mandatory
detention.
it
does
not
allow
him
to
show
what
our
cases
require
that
he
have
a
chance
to
show
and
that
is
that
his
detention
serves
no
governmental
purpose.
by
authorizing
kim's
detention
today,
the
court
is
allowing
the
government
to
imprison
a
lawful
resident
of
this
country
even
though
there
is
no
need
to
do
that.
justice
stevens,
justice
ginsburg
and
i
believe
that
sucn
an
action
is
a
fundamental
denial
of
due
process.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
constitution
correctly.
we
would
affirm
its
judgment
and
we
respectfully
dissent
from
the
court's
contrary
conclusion.
