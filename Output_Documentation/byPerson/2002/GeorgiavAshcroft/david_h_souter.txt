justice
david
h.
souter
is--
--so
that's
the--
--is...
is
that
one
of
the
ways,
at
least,
that
you
think
we
ought
to
view
this
case?
as
i
understand
it,
no
one
on
the
other
side
is
claiming
that
the
percentage
of
safety
has
got
to
be
maintained
in
order
to
avoid
retrogression.
but
one
difference
between
you
and
them,
at
least
as
i
am
reading
what
you're
saying,
is
you,
i
think,
are
saying
they
maintain
the
same
opportunity
to
elect.
minorities
maintain
the
same
opportunity
to
elect
if
they
use
their
best
efforts
and
their
good
politicians
in
doing
it.
whereas,
the
other
side
seems
to
be
saying,
there's
got
to
be
more
of
a
margin
of
safety
for
maintaining...
or
avoiding
retrogression
than
merely
best
efforts.
there
should
be
some
margin
of
safety,
even
if
it's
not
as
great
as
it
used
to
be
under
the
old
districts.
is
that
a
fair
way
of
looking
at
the
disagreement?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that's
the...
that's
the
conclusion,
and
we're...
we're
looking
for
some
kind
of
indication
at
this
point
of
whether
that
is
true.
and
the
only
indication
that
at
least
i
have
and
i
think
that
justice
ginsburg
is...
is
looking
at
right
now
are...
are
the
percentage
figures,
the
bvap
percentage
figures.
justice
david
h.
souter
--so...
so
what
you're
saying
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
what
is
your
answer
to
this...
this
counter-argument?
i
don't
know
whether
the
other
side
is
going
to
make
it,
but
let...
let
me...
let
me
try
it
here.
the
reason
that
section
5
is
in
there
is
that
efforts
simply
to
achieve
your
plimsoll
line,
the...
the
equal
opportunity,
historically
failed
over
and
over
and
over
and
over
again
because
every
time
a
decree
came
down
saying
equal
opportunity
is
required,
there
would
be
another
voting
change
that,
in
fact,
would
inject
a...
a
new
fact
pattern.
and
the
new
fact
pattern,
just
about
every
time,
resulted
in
something
less
than
equality.
section
5
is
there,
in
effect,
to
say
you
can't...
you
can't
make
a
move
without
advance
approval,
and
the
only
way,
in
effect...
this
court
has
said
in
beer,
the
only
way
to...
or
the...
the
best
way
at
least,
to
keep
from
moving
that
line
in
a
way
which
is
going
to
result
in
less
than
an
equal
opportunity
is
to
insist
that
at
least
the
status
quo,
as
best
you
can
determine
it,
is,
in
fact,
not
going
to
be
modified
by
the
change.
and
if
the
status
quo
is
some
measure
of
safety,
then
the
theory
of
section
5
is
preserve
the
measure
of
safety
because
if
you
don't
do
that,
we
know
what's
going
to
happen,
and
what's
going
to
happen
is
you're
not
going
to
get
to
the
line
of
equality.
that's
the
argument.
it's
essentially
an
historical
argument.
and
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
we...
that's
what
you
get
for
general
laws.
we...
we've
got
a
general
law,
and
that's
the
theory
behind
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
wouldn't
it
be...
why
wouldn't
it
be
fair
for
us
to
say,
number
one,
we're
going
to
maintain
the
beer
theory?
and
we're
going
to
accept
the
position
taken
by
judge
edwards
that
if
there
was
a
margin
of
safety
before,
there's
got
to
be
some
margin
of
safety
now
in
order
to
comply
with
beer
and
ultimately
with
section
5,
and
we're
going
to
leave
the
law
alone
to
that
extent
because
the
statute
is
up
for
renewal
in
a
few
years,
and
that
will
be
an
appropriate
time
for
congress
to
decide
whether
it
wants
to
modify
the
standard
or,
indeed,
to
continue
to
have
any
section
5
standard
at
all.
that's
a
timing
argument.
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we've--
justice
david
h.
souter
--maybe...
maybe
it
would
be--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
this
isn't
repealed.
this
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--this
is
an
automatic
expiration--
justice
david
h.
souter
--on
which
congress
will
have
to
act.
