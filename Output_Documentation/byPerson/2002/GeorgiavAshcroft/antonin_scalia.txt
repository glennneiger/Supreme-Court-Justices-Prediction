you're
drawing
a
distinction
between
safe
and
certain.
now,
did--
justice
antonin
scalia
--did
judge
edwards--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
drop
that
makes
no
difference.
that's...
that's
how
i
understood
their
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
safe
seat
is
a
safe
seat.
it
means
a
certain
seat.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
contain
the
word
backsliding,
does
it?
what...
what's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what's
the
text
that...
that
we're
interpreting
and...
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--interpreting
to
mean
backsliding?
justice
antonin
scalia
abridge
or
deny
the
right
to
vote.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
that
has
been
interpreted
by
some
of
our
opinions
to
mean
that
once
a
certain
level
is
reached,
you're
abridging
or
denying
the
right
to
vote
if
it
goes
below
that
level
of...
of
safety.
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--no.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
if
we
make
it
bad
enough,
they'll
think
about
repealing
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
worse
is
better
from
your
standpoint.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
certainty
or...
or
ability?
i'm...
i'm
really
concerned
about
how
far
we
are
getting
from
the
text
of
the
statute.
the
statute
says
nothing
about
retrogression.
indeed,
it
says
nothing
about
redistricting.
it...
it's...
it...
it
says
that
if
one
of
the
states
who
were
covered
by
section
5
seeks
to
administer
any
voting
qualification
or
prerequisite
to
voting,
or
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting,
which
i
would
have
thought
meant,
you
know,
whether
you
vote
on
a...
on
a
working
day
or
on
a
non-working
day,
whether
the
polls
are
open
for
a
certain
amount
of
time
or
not.
anyway,
we've
expanded
that
to
cover
districting.
then
it
goes
on
and
it
says,
any
change
cannot
have
the
purpose
and
will
not
have
the
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color.
and
we
have
said
that
that
means
you're
denying
or
abridging
the
right...
the
right
to
vote
if
you
backslide.
if...
if
a...
even
though
all
of
the
black
or
minority
citizens
can
vote
just
the
way
they
did
before,
if
the
percentage
of...
of
minority
voters
in
a...
in
a
certain
district
goes
down,
we
have
denied
or
abridged
their
right
to
vote.
i...
i
find
that...
maybe
that
is
a
plausible
interpretation
of
the
statute
when
you
are
going
from
a
good
chance
to
elect
a
minority
candidate
to
no
chance
of
electing
a
minority
candidate.
maybe
you
can
stretch
it
that
far,
but
to
say
that
you're
abridging
or
denying
the
right
to
vote
when
you
go
from
a
certainty
or
safe
seat
for
electing
a
minority
candidate
to
a
mere
probability
of...
of
electing
a
minority
candidate...
to
say
that
that
constitutes
a
denying
or
abridging
of
the
right
to
vote
seems
to
me
to...
you
know,
in
violation
of
the...
of
the
legal
principle
that
fun's
fun
but
you
can't
die
laughing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that
is
such
a...
such
a
stretch
of
the
statutory
language
that
the...
that
the
government
is
asking
us
to
accept
that
i...
i
find
it
implausible.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you...
you
wouldn't
say
that
a
reduction
from
90
percent
minority
to
85
percent
minority
abridges,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
proposition
that
mere
reduction
is
enough
is...
is
simply
not
valid.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
say
that
the
reduction
that
counts
is
the
reduction
below
the
point
where
the
minority
has
a
probability
of
winning
the
election?
why
does
it
have
to
be
below
the
point
where
the
minority
has
a
certainty
of...
of
winning
the
election?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you
should
have
appealed.
i
mean,
that...
if
that
was
a
real
possibility,
you
should
have
appealed,
but
not
to
appeal
and
then
ask
us
to
decide
whether
you're
proper
intervenors
because
this
might
affect
you,
it
seems
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
can't
walk
both
sides
of
the
street.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
intervention
was
granted,
but
you
didn't
join
the
appeal
from...
from
the
decision
below
or
file
a
cross
appeal.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't...
didn't
almost
all
of
the
black
legislature...
legislators
in
the
georgia
assembly
favor
this...
this
plan?
justice
antonin
scalia
how...
how
many
opposed
it?
was
it
just
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
woman.
i
forget
her
name.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
be,
but
i...
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
they
didn't
have
the...
the...
or
a
majority
of
them
at
least
didn't
have
the
best
interests
of
their...
of
their
race
in...
in
mind.
and...
and
of
course,
you
know
that
one
of
the
problems
has
been
in
the
southern
states
packing
minorities
into
one
district.
i
mean,
it's
been
the...
in
the
interest
of
particular
political
parties
on
occasion
to
put
all
the
black
voters
in
one
district
so
that
all
the
other
districts
can
be...
can
go
to
the
other
party.
and,
you
know,
maybe
the
black
voters
who
supported
this
plan
did
so
because
they
thought
it
was
a
good
thing
to
disperse
some
of
the
black
voters
who
weren't
needed
to...
to
produce
a
high
probability
of
success
for
a
black
candidate
into
other
districts.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
a
very
plausible
explanation--
justice
antonin
scalia
the
black...
the
black
community's
candidates
of
choice
has
overwhelmingly
been
democrats
and
to...
to
increase
the
probability
of
getting
a
democrat
elected
by
moving
black
voters
into
another
district
is
precisely
to
give
black
voters
a...
a
better
choice,
to...
to...
it
may
not
be
a
black
candidate,
but
it
will
be
the
candidate
the
black
voters
want.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
but...
but
i...
it's
an
implausible
argument
that
you
are...
you
are
contravening
the
choice
of
black
voters
by
increasing
the
probability
of
a
democrat's
getting
elected.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
district
court
didn't
consider
that
relevant
testimony
because
it
was
not
testimony
about
safe
seats
elsewhere.
