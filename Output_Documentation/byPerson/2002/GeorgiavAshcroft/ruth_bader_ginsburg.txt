mr.
walbert,
i
didn't
get
that
impression
from
judge
edwards'
opinion
or
judge
sullivan's.
they
both
say
we
are
dealing
with
a
narrow
section
5.
it
has
a
concept,
retrogression,
backsliding.
and
i
assume
that
they
would
say
if
you
start
out,
you
start
with
the
status
quo.
everyone
agrees
with
that.
if
you
start
out
with,
say,
30
percent
and
you
end
up
with
30
percent,
it's
okay.
you
don't
have
to
have
a
safe
district
because
the
starting
point
may
not
be
safe.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
it...
are
you
saying
that
when
you
get
up
over
a
certain
number
of
black
voters,
say,
50
percent,
then
retrogression
or
backsliding
is
really
out
of
the
picture
because
it's
good
enough?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
sounds
very
much
like
section
2
language.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
bossier,
the
two
cases,
clarified
the
difference
between
section
2
and
section
5,
and
what
you
just
read
from
justice
marshall
sounds
to
me
like
the
section
2
standard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
section
5
standard
is
you
start
with
what
you
have,
you
look
to
see
if
there's
backsliding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
start
with,
say,
55.
where
does
backsliding
start
in
your
view
of
section
5?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
how
do
you
fit
backsliding,
retrogression--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if...
if
you
go,
say,
from
55
to
what?
44?
that's
okay
because
you...
you
would
have
a
fair
opportunity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
although
it
would
seem
an
unusual
definition
of
backslide.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
doesn't
contain--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
the...
the
district
court
found
that...
i
thought
there
was
a
heavy
concentration
on
crossover
in
this
record.
wasn't
that
the
whole
controversy
about
engstrom?
didn't
he
say
that
there
would
be
minimal
white
crossover
in
these
districts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
intervention
was
granted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
how
could
you
appeal
from
a
victory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
i
ask
before...
before
you
conclude
your
argument,
what
is
the
status
of
the
litigation
that's
pending
in
the
state
court
to
resolve
the
dispute
between
the
attorney
general
and
the
governor?
