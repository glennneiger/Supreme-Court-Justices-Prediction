mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
a
section
5
preclearance
action,
the
appropriate
comparison
is
between
a
covered
jurisdiction's
proposed
voting
change
and
the
jurisdiction's
existing
practice.
in
the
present
case,
the
district
court
found
that
georgia's
proposed
senate
districting
plan
was
likely
to
cause
a
significant
diminution
of
black
voters'
ability
to
elect
their
candidates
of
choice.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
justice
department--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
justice
department's
view
is
that
the
analysis
should
focus
on
the
plan
as
a
whole,
and
our
guidance
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
do
look
at
the
plan
as
a
whole.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
because
our...
our
feeling
was
that
there
were
three
senate
districts
that
we
focused
on
specifically
because
we
felt,
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
that
the
diminution
in
black
population
was
likely
to
have
a
significant
impact
on
black
voters'
ability
to
elect
candidates
of
choice
in
those
three
districts.
and
we...
we
also
looked
to
where
those
black
voters
were
going.
were
they
being
redistributed
to
other
districts
in
which
they
would
increase
the
ability
to
elect
candidates
of
choice?
the...
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
has
always
been
on
the
ability
to
elect
candidates
of
choice.
so,
for
instance,
if--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--several
points.
the...
the
court
in
the
second
bossier
parish
case
discussed
the
retrogression
standard
and
grounded
it
in
the
word
abridge
and
explained
that
the...
the
word
abridge
necessarily
implies
a
comparison
to
some
baseline.
and
in
the
section
2
context,
the
baseline
is
a
hypothetical
reasonable
world.
but
because
section
5
is
targeted
specifically
at
voting
changes,
the
appropriate
baseline
is
the
jurisdiction's
existing
practice.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
because
i
think
the
likelihood
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think...
i
think
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i...
i
think
one...
one
thing
the
court
should
focus
on
is
that
when
we're
talking
about
the
senate
districts
at
issue
here,
we
are
talking
about
districts
that
are
among
the
strongest
for
blacks
in
the
state
of
georgia;
that
is,
under
the
benchmark
plan,
13
out
of
56
districts
with...
senate
districts
within
the
state
had
majority
black
voting
age
populations.
that's
in
a
state
that's
approximately
27
percent
black
in
terms
of
voting
age
population.
so
to
say
that
the
districts
in
which
blacks
are
strongest
have
been
reduced
to
a
point
where
blacks
have
an
equal
opportunity
to
elect
candidates
is
not
equivalent
to
saying
that
in
the
state
as
a
whole
blacks
have
equal
electoral
opportunities.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
i
think
if
we're
going
from
the
90
percent
certainty
to
the
51
percent
likelihood--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
would
still
say
that's
retrogression.
we...
we
do
have
a
sort
of
substantiality
inquiry
in
department
of
justice
preclearance
practice
where--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
i
think
part
of
the
reason--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--part
of
the
reason
that
the
government
challenged
these
three
districts
had
to
do
with
the
magnitude
of
the
increase,
but
part
of
it
also
had
to
do
with
electoral
history
and
evidence
of
racially
polarized
voting.
and
i...
i
don't--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
i
don't
know
the
reason
that
we
didn't
object
to...
to
senate
district
15.
i
do
know
as
to
senate
district
2,
for
instance,
that
even
though
the
bvap
under
the
benchmark
plan
was
over
60
percent,
in
a
1999
runoff
election,
the
black
candidate
of
choice
had
won
the...
the
primary
by
only
70
votes,
and
the
reason
was
that
the
black
candidate
received
approximately
78
percent
of
the
black
vote
but
only
9
percent
of
the
white
vote,
and
then--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
certainly
think
that
they
do,
and...
and
nothing
that
we've
said
in
this
case
and
nothing
that
the
district
court
said
is
to
the
contrary.
that
is,
if
the
state
had
sought
to
prove
that
the
likelihood
of
electing
black
voters'
candidates
of
choice
in
these
three
districts
would
be
somewhat
reduced,
but
that
that
was
likely
to
be
offset
by
corresponding
increases
in
the
ability
to
elect...
to
elect
candidates
of
choice
in
other
districts--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't...
there
was...
there
was
a
pair
of
senate
districts,
not
2,
12,
and
26,
one
of
which
was
reduced
sharply
in
black
population--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
that...
that's
not
the
case
at
all.
i
think
the...
the
nature
of
the
state's
plan
was
to
reduce
the
high
majorities
of
black
voters
in
some
districts,
and
those
voters
would
be
redistributed
to
other
districts,
but
not
districts
in
which
there
would
be
a
high
enough
black
population
to
create
a
plausible
likelihood
of
electing
black
candidates
of
choice.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
as...
as
an
original
matter,
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
that
black
voters
throughout
the
state
of
georgia
would
be
better
off
if
every
district
were
27
percent
black
on
the
theory
that
even
though
they
couldn't
elect
any
candidates
of
choice,
they
could
influence
all
legislators.
but
although
an
argument
could
be
made
along
those
lines,
the
court
has
consistently,
in
its
vote
dilution
cases,
framed
the
inquiry
in
terms
of
the
ability
to
elect...
to
elect
candidates
of
choice.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i...
i
agree
that
the...
the
precise
question
hasn't
come
before
this
court.
the
two
things
i'd
say
are
that,
first,
we
are
talking
about
the
strongest
districts
for
blacks.
so
to
say
that
those
districts
have
been
reduced
to
an
even
shot,
a
toss-up,
is
not
to
say
that
blacks
have
equal
electoral
power
statewide.
the
second
point
i'd
make
is
this
is
not
different
in
principle
from
what
goes
on
all
the
time
in
other
preclearance
settings.
that
is,
it
is
often
the
case
that
a
covered
jurisdiction
will
seek
preclearance
of
a
voting
change,
and
the
change
will
consist
of
getting
rid
of
something
that
the
jurisdiction
had
no
obligation
to
create
in
the
first
instance.
but
the
inquiry
has
always
focused
on
retrogression,
on
whether
the
state
has
made
black
voters
worse
off
than
they
were--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
i
think
you're
looking
at
it
correctly.
and
when
the
justice
department
approached
this
case,
there
were
other
senate
districts
in
which
the
absolute
drop
in
black
voting
age
population
was
much
greater
than
in
these
three
districts.
the
reason
we
found
these
districts
problematic
was
partly
the...
the
magnitude
of
the
reduction,
partly
the
fact
that
it
had
occurred
along
a
point
in
the
spectrum
where
a
10
percent
reduction
was
especially
likely
to
have
a
concrete
impact.
that
is,
it
stands
to
reason
that
reducing
black
population
from
60
percent
to
50
percent
will
more
likely
affect
concrete
results
than
reducing
it
from
80
percent
to
70
percent
or
from
20
percent
to
10
percent.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
and
we...
we
introduced--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
introduced--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
introduced
substantial
district-specific
evidence
of
racial
polarization
in
these
three
specific
senate
districts.
we...
both
statistical
and
anecdotal
evidence
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
high
degree
of
correlation
between
the
race
of
the
voter
and
the
candidate
of
choice
and
evidence
that
racial
appeals
had
been
made
in
prior
elections
within
those
districts.
so
the
first
step
was
to
say,
based
on
all
that
evidence,
there
is
a...
this
change
is
likely
to
have
a
significant
impact
on
black
voters'
ability
to
elect
candidates
of
choice
in
these
districts.
and
the
district
court
found
to
that
effect.
and
the
second
thing
that
the
district
court
said--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
his...
his
analysis
of
the
statistical
evidence
of
prior
elections
within
the
districts
was
that
there
would
be
minimal
white
crossover
voting.
there
was
substantial
racial
polarization
within
these
three
districts
specifically.
and
so
the
district
court
found
that
the
likelihood
of
black
candidates...
of
black
voters'
ability
being
able
to
elect
candidates
of
choice
in
these
three
districts--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
i
don't
believe
that
there
were
findings
to
that
effect.
the...
the
findings
were
basically
surveying
the
last--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--during
the
last
few
years.
basically
the
experience
under
the
benchmark
district.
but
the
second
thing
that
the
district
court
said
and...
and
emphasized...
and
i
believe
it's
on
pages
133
and
134a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
the
district
court
said
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page,
once
again
we
note
that
it
may
well
be
the
case
that
any
decrease
in
african
american
electoral
power
in
senate
districts
2,
12,
and
26
will
be
offset
by
gains
in
other
districts,
but
plaintiff,
namely
the
state,
has
failed
to
present
any
such
evidence.
so
the
district
court
acknowledged
in
principle
that
even
though
black
voters'
ability
to
elect
candidates
of
choice
in
these
three
districts
had
been
substantially
decreased,
the
state
might,
nevertheless,
be
able
to
prove
non-retrogression
for
the
plan
as
a
whole
if
it
presented
evidence
that
there
would
be
offsetting
gains
in
other
districts.
and
the
court
faulted
the
state
for
a
failure
of
proof
not
for
any...
not...
it
didn't
suggest
that
there
was
a...
an
analytical
barrier
to
proceeding
along
that
basis.
so
i
think
the
district
court
regarded
this
as
a
relatively
easy
case
precisely
because
there
were
meaningful
losses
in
identified
districts
and
no
attempt
to
prove
offsetting
gains
in
others.
and
again,
the
retrogression
standard
has
always
focused
on
whether
the
change
renders
minority
voters
worse
off.
and
again,
the...
the
preclearance
inquiry
would
substantially...
be
substantially
complicated
if
the
analysis
were
otherwise.
that
is
the
court
has
held,
for
instance,
that
relocation
of
polling
places
is
one
type
of
change
that
has
to
be
precleared
before
it
can--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the...
the
gravamen
of
the...
the
testimony
was
not
that
there
would
be
offsetting
gains
in
black
voters'
ability
to
elect
candidates
of
choice.
really,
the
thrust
of
the
plan
was
black
voters
would
be
taken
out
of
majority
black
districts
and
placed
in
districts
that
were
predominantly
white.
the
black
percentages
would
be
too
low
for
the
black
electorate
to
elect
candidates
of
choice,
but
it
might
be
high
enough
that
the
black
vote
could
swing
the
balance
between
a
white
republican
and
a
white
democratic
candidate.
that
was
really
the
thrust
of
the
plan.
and
because...
again,
whatever
might
have
been
said
in
the
first
instance,
the
court's
analysis
has
focused
on
ability
to
elect
candidates
of
choice.
congress
has
amended
section
2
to
facilitate
vote
dilution
claims
along
those
lines.
congress
has
continued
to
reenact
section
5
against
the
backdrop
of
the
court's
decision.
so
even
though
the
argument
could
have
been
made
that
it's
more
important
for
blacks
to
be
the
balance
of
power
in
a
lot
of
districts
than
to
be
able
to
elect
candidates
of
choice
in
a
few,
the
court
has
rejected
that
proposition
and
congress
appears
to
have
endorsed
the
court's
holdings
by
continuing
to
reenact
these
provisions
without
change.
if
the
court
has
nothing
further.
