justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's...
what's
the
legal
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is,
i...
i
thought
there's
a
statute,
and
the
statute
here
says
that
you
cannot
have
a
new
plan
which
will
have
the
effect
of
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
judge
edwards
says
that
that
statute
has
been
interpreted
to
mean
you
cannot
backslide,
and
he
adds
that
if
you
go
from
a
safe
seat
to
a
seat
where
there's
only
a
fair
opportunity,
that
is
clearly
backsliding
unless
it's
made
up
for
in
other
districts.
let's
call
it
frontsliding.
and
here
there
is
no
evidence
of
frontsliding,
and
here
there
are
two
experts
who
disagree
as
to
the
backsliding.
one
is
epstein
who
thinks
there
isn't,
and
the
other
is
engstrom--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--who
thinks
there
is.
and
two
judges
below
agreed
with
engstrom
and
one
judge
below
agreed
with
epstein.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
are
we
supposed
to
do...
to
go
back
and
redo
the
work
of
those
three
judges
and
say,
well,
we
happen
to
think
epstein
was
better
or
the
other
one
thinks
engstrom
was
better?
is
that
this...
what
this
case
is
about?
and
if
it
isn't
about
this,
i
don't
know
what
it's
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i'm
overstating
what
i
say
for
purposes
of
clarity,
because
you're
giving
a
view
of
engstrom,
and
i'm
sure
the
other
side
will
give
a
somewhat
different
view,
but
nonetheless,
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
i'm
supposed
to
do
as
a
judge
in
this
court.
after
reading
it,
i
thought
what
you're
asking
me
to
do
is
to
go
back,
look
at
what
judge
edwards
and
the
other
majority
judge
cite
as
convincing,
factual,
detailed
statistical
evidence,
look
at
the
evidence
of
the
political
figures
who
are
very
distinguished
whom
judge
oberdorfer
cites
the
other
way,
and
remake
that
evaluation
that
three
judges
of...
of
a
three-judge
district
court
did.
now,
my
question
is,
is
that
right?
have
it
got
it
right
what
you
think
we
should
do
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
good.
then
what
is
it
i'm
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
why...
if
that's
the
issue,
assuming
that
the
safe
seat,
going
down
to
only
a
probable
seat,
is
nowhere
made
up
for
by
countervailing
factors
elsewhere
in
the
state,
assuming
that,
why
isn't
going
from
a
safe
seat
to
a
fair
probability
seat...
why
is
that
not
backsliding,
retrogression,
other
things
being
equal,
an
abridgement,
a...
the
effect
of
abridging
the
right
to
vote
because
of
race?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
it?
it
if
that's
the
issue,
why
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
reading...
i'll
say
it
again
because
i'm
reading
from
judge
edwards.
going
from
a
safe
district--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--into
one
where
there
is
only
a
fair
opportunity,
that...
that,
he
says,
other
things
being
equal
in
the
state,
will
constitute
retrogression
in
effect,
not
necessarily
in
purpose,
but
in
effect.
and
now,
why
isn't
that
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
didn't
think
we're
dealing
with
safe
versus
certain
in
this
case.
i
thought
what
we're
dealing
in
this
case
is
two
judges
decided
that
dropping
from
safe
to
whatever
you
want
to
characterize
this
level...
edwards
characterizes
it
as
fair
probability,
but
characterize
it
as
you
wish...
dropping
from
safe
to
this
level,
however
you
want
to
characterize
this,
is
a
retrogression.
and
one
judge
thought
it
wasn't
given
the
circumstances.
so
what
is
it
that
you,
aside
from
re-evaluating
the
evidence,
believe
that
we
should
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
is
that
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
why
is
edwards'
standard
in
your
opinion
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you--
--and
the
reason
for
that
is
because,
i
gather,
historically
there
were
quite
a
few
instances
where,
indeed,
in
the
south,
you
could
elect...
a
black
representative
was
elected
by
a
black
community
in,
let's
say,
one
district.
and
then,
lo
and
behold,
what
happens
is
that
the
district
boundaries
are
changed
so
that
there
happened
to
be
a
lot
fewer
black
representatives
elected
out
of
districts
that
were
predominantly
black.
i
take
it
that's
why
congress
passed
this
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
backsliding
so
that
you
had
fewer
people
who
were--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
it
doesn't
really
have
to
do
with
retrogression
in
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
worse
off,
i
thought...
and
i'm
still
at
my
same
problem
of
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
in
this
case.
but
i
thought
worse
off
means
their
right
to
vote
is
abridged
because
of
race.
abridged
is
the
word.
and
that
it
isn't
so
much
a
question,
though
it's
partly
a
question,
of
percentage
of
black
voters
in
the
district.
it
is
really
a
question
of
what
a
reduction
in
that
percentage
means
in
terms
of
a...
a
race,
black
people,
being
able,
across
the
state,
to
have
a
better
or
worse
chance
of
electing
public
officials
that
they
want.
and
that's
a
function
of
polarization
because
if
there
isn't
a
lot
of
polarization,
there
is
no
such
person
as
the
official
they
want.
but
there
might
be
where
there
is
polarization.
and
it's
also
a
function
of
how
much
of
a
reduction
you
get
in
a
particular
district
in
terms
of
what
that
means.
now,
if
i'm
thinking
that
way,
a,
is
that
the
right
way
to
think
about
it?
b,
if
it
is,
do
i
have
any
alternative
in
this
case
but
to
go
through
the
statistical
testimony
about
polarization?
the
testimony,
if
there
is
any,
which
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
or
not...
i
thought
the
majority
held
there
wasn't...
that
somehow
other
districts
will
be
benefitted,
and
then
sort
of
second
guess
the
district
court.
what
is
it
i'm
supposed
to
do?
do
i
have
it
right?
and
if
i
have
it
right,
is
that
what
i'm
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
isn't
just
percents--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
a
question
of
what
a
percent
means
in
the
context
of
the
particular
district.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
not
just
a
little.
it
has
to
be
a
lot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
to
mean
a
lot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whether
they're
democrats
or
republicans
or
whatever
they
are
in
these
other
districts,
i
take
it
in
your
view
if
evidence
had
been
put
on
the
stand
that
the
black
voter
was
better
off,
then
you
might
lose
your
side
of
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
evidence
is
where?
what
am
i
supposed
to
read?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what...
what
do
i
read
and
what
pages
do
i
read?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
we're
supposed
to,
go
into
which
political
party
is
better
for
which
particular
group
of
people?
