justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let...
let
me
ask
you
this
because
some
of
what
you
say
might
be
explained
as
just
a
difference
of...
of...
a
conclusion
of
facts,
which
we
have
to
accept.
were
there
legal
premises
that
the
majority
opinions
adopted
below
that
were
wrong?
was
it
wrong
to
talk
about
robust
campaigning?
was
it
wrong
to
consider
polarized
voting?
were
there...
did
the
controlling
opinions
make
reference
to
any
impermissible
legal
standards?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
what
it...
what
it
comes
down
to
is
not
a...
is...
is
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
take
a
safe
district
and
make
it
a
district
where
there's
just
a...
an
even
chance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
this
cannot
be
within
the
definition
of
retrogression.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
ask
a
sort
of
a
general
question?
in
any
of
the
analysis,
do
the...
the
judges
take
into
account
the
likelihood
of
winning
primaries
as
opposed
to
the
likelihood
of
winning
the
election
itself?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
illegitimate
for
the
state
to
decide
to
keep
the
safe
seat
if
it
wants?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--illegitimate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it...
it
is
proper.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
is
it
proper
for
the
justice
department
to
consider
that
in
its
discretion
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
preclear?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
using
an
illegitimate
factor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the--
--what
about
section
15?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
state
have
any
latitude
insofar
as
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
concerned
and
insofar
as
your
department
policy
is
concerned
to
experiment
to
see
if
it
can't
expand
the
black
franchise
in
other
districts?
nothing
in
life
is
certain,
and
your
position
is...
is
that
the
state
is
simply
frozen
in
these
supermajority
districts
and
it
can't
attempt
to
increase
minority
representation
in
other
districts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
doesn't
it
have...
doesn't
the
state
have
some
latitude
to
try
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
the
same...
i
have
the
same
problem
with
justice
o'connor.
i...
i
thought
the
case
was
before
us
on...
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
likelihood
that
there
will
be
another
black
representative
from
another
district--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that
that
was
the
testimony
of
the
state
and
the
state
said
that
this
is
the
reason
why
we're
doing
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why...
why
is
that
the
only
change
that's
relevant?
why
is
it
insignificant
that
you...
you
change
a
district
that
was
previously
lily-white
into
a
district
that
has,
let's
say,
30
percent
black
voters
whose
wishes
and
whose
desires
have
to
be
taken
into
account
by
whoever
is
elected
from
that
district,
whether
he's
white
or
black?
why
is
that
an
insignificant
benefit
to...
to
the
black
voters
in
that
district
so
they
won't
get
some...
some
redneck
discriminatory
representative,
but
rather
somebody
who
will
take
into
account
their
needs,
even
if
he's
not
a
black
man?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we've
never
had
a
case
before
that...
that
amounts
to
a
reduction
not
below
the
level
where
they
can
elect,
but...
but
just
to
the
level
where
it's
merely
probable
as
opposed
to
certain
that...
that
they
can
elect.
i...
i
don't
know
that
we're
foreclosed
from
taking
that
reality
into
account.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
they
were
not
offsetting
gains,
what
was
the
gravamen
of
the
testimony
of
the
black
state
officials
who
testified
in
favor
of
this
plan?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
conceivable
if
all
they're
interested
in...
is,
is
in
race
and
you
want
us
to
presume
that.
they
might
also
wanted
to
have
kept
their
jobs.
