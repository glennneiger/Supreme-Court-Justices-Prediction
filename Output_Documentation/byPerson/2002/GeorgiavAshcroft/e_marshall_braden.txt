mr.
e.
marshall
braden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
court:
i
assume
that
the
threshold
question
for
the
intervenors
in
this
case
raised
by
the
state
is
whether
or
not
the
two
intervenors
of
the
four
intervenors,
two
african
american
republican
voters
and
two
african
american
democrat
voters,
are
properly
in
this
case.
is
intervention
permitted
in
a
section
5
case?
if
precedent
or
experience
provides
any
guidance
to
this
court,
the
answer
clearly
is
yes.
in
more
than
70
percent
of
the
section
5
litigation
in
district
court
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
more
than
70
percent
of
those
cases
have
involved
intervenors.
there
is
not
a
single
case...
not
a
single
case...
cited
by
the
state
of
georgia
where
the
court
has
rejected
the
concept
of
intervention
in
section
5
litigation.
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
absolutely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and--
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
--intervenors
did
not
join
in
the
appeal.
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
as
to
our
issue,
it's
not
moot
because
this
court
might
fashion
a
remedy
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
for
additional
findings,
in
which
we
would
have
presumably
a
position
to
argue
it
in
that
case.
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
we
did
not
ask
this--
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
--intervention
was
granted.
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
i
do
not
know,
justice.
it
appears
to
me
that--
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
--that
is
correct.
but
we
are
before
this
court
now
and
that...
in
that
issue
i
think
we
are
properly
before
this
court
as
decided
by
the
lower
court.
now,
the
real
issue
i
think
below...
before
this
court
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
can
accept
georgia's
invitation
to
throw
out
27
years
of
your
jurisprudence
because
the
reality
of
the
georgia
position
is
the
rejection
of
retrogression.
it's
not
this
bugaboo
about
safe
seats.
every
redistricting
plan,
by
its
very
nature,
creates
safe
seats.
the
plan
that
wasn't
precleared
created
safe
seats.
it
simply
created
safe
seats
solely
for
white
members
of
the
legislature.
their
proposal
would
permit
the
state
to
decide
that
there's
only
one
class
of
georgia's
citizens
entitled
to
safe
electoral
seats,
and
that
would
be
white
voters
in
georgia.
the
reality
of
what
happened
in
the
georgia
redistricting
process
is
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case.
to
maintain
the
political
majority
in
the
state
legislature
in
georgia,
the
individuals
involved
in
the
process
looked
at
it
and
decided,
well,
these
existing
black
districts,
these
existing
represented
communities
have
to
be
divided
up.
black
precincts
have
to
be
pulled
out
of
those
districts
and
put
in
adjoining
white
districts
so
we
may
be
able
to
maintain
the
democrat
level
of
vote
in
those
districts
so
white
democrats
can
win.
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
that
is,
in
fact,
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
one
in--
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
--actually,
i
believe
there
were
two,
but
one
in
the
senate.
actually
the
senator
representing
district
2
which
was
one
of
the
districts
that
was
rejected
in
this
case.
but
i
might
make
the
observation
that
the
view
from
aboard
the
ship
of
state
and
on
the
dock
is
quite
different.
if
you're
on
board
the
ship,
if
you're
already
in
the
legislature,
the
gangplank
doesn't
look
very
steep
going
up,
but
if
you're
there
trying
to
get
aboard
the
ship
of
state,
if
you're
not
an
incumbent...
incumbents
have
a
different
view
and
when
an
incumbent
needs
to
be
elected,
it's
totally
different
than
a
challenger
candidate.
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
that...
that...
justice
scalia,
that
is
a
very
plausible
explanation
in
a
hypothetical
state.
it
simply
isn't
a
plausible
explanation
in
the
case
of
georgia.
one,
no
one
alleged
that
these
districts
were
packed.
that
simply...
argument
was
never
made.
second,
we're
not
talking
about
incumbents
looking
at
the
notion
of
whether
or
not
we
will
maintain,
quote/unquote,
our
racial
position.
we're
talking
about
incumbents
looking
about--
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
--whether
or
not
they'll
be
elected.
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
absolutely
correct.
and
in
fact,
to
be
candid
with
you,
it's
our
view
as
the
intervenors...
we
believe
the
court
actually
probably
went
too
low,
that
they
took
the
numbers
down,
and
frankly,
the
election
results
from
the
last
election
showed
that
our
argument
was
vindicated
by
the
failure
to
elect
in
certain
district
candidates
of
choice.
the
process...
the
district
court
took
a
very
conservative
view
on
the
issue
of
retrogression.
they
permitted
the
state
to
decrease
the
number
of
black
voting
age
populations
in
many
districts,
and
the
reason
for
that
was
not
to
unpack.
look
at
the
record.
i
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
record.
look
at
the
testimony
of
the
person
who
drew
the
plan.
look
at
the
dissenting
opinion
of
the
judge.
clearly
what
was
happening
here
was
a
desire
to
divide
up
an
existing
community,
to
move
black
precincts
into
other
districts
to
help
elect
democrat
candidates.
now,
politically
that's
understandable
and
political
gerrymandering...
it
would
appear
to
me,
that
it's
possibly
constitutional
to
do
that,
but
not
in
a
retrogression
situation
where
we
would
reduce
the
black
community's
ability
to
elect
its
candidates
of
choice.
and
that's
what's
happening.
undeniable.
and
you're
talking
about
two
different
classes
of
candidates.
we
have
white
safe
seats
but
not
black.
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
and
i
think
that's
a
misinterpretation
of
this
court's
position
and
a
misunderstanding
of
what
the
voting
rights
is
meant
to
protect.
this
is
not
a
max
democrat
plan.
our
jurisprudence
doesn't
point...
we've
got
to
create
as
many
democrat
seats
as
possible.
we're
talking
about
maintaining
the
existing
level
of
the
choice
of
the
minority
community
which
might
be
democrat
or
might
be
republican.
but
we're
not...
it's
hard
to
imagine
the
congress
in
1982
renewed
this
act
and
thought
it
would
be
interpreted
of...
of
not
looking
at
how
many
black
or
minority
candidates
would
be
chosen,
but
how
many
democrats
would
be
elected
to
a
legislature.
one
can't
possibly
believe
that
they
would
think
that
your
jurisprudence
would
metamorphose
to
something
like
that.
that
cannot
be
what
we're
looking
at.
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
in...
justice
scalia,
the
fallacy
i
believe
of
that
argument,
in
all
due
respect,
is
that
there's
one
type
of
democrat
candidate,
and
the
reality
to
that
is
there
isn't
one
type.
and
the
political
science
on
this
is
abundantly
clear
and
the
record
in
this
case
is
abundantly
clear
that
there's
racial
polarization
and
bloc
voting.
no
one
denies
that.
it
exists
in
georgia.
and
this
is
simply
a
continuation
of
georgia's
sad
history
of
100
years
of
not
just
blocking
minority
voting
rights,
but
enacting
statutes
and
working
very
hard
to
do
this.
and
this
is,
in
fact,
another
statute
that
was
created
to...
again
to
divide
up
existing
representative
districts,
move
out
black
precincts
to
elect
democrats.
that's
the
process
here.
there
is
no
tension
whatsoever--
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
--in
the
district
that
they're
moved
to.
this
is
just
a
carefully
calculated
scheme
to
move
the
numbers
down
to
make
adjoining
districts
to
those
existing
black
districts
more
likely
to
elect
democrat
candidates.
and
what
happens
is
those
districts
the
black
precincts
are
moved
from
become
less
likely
to
choose
the
candidate
of
choice
in
more--
mr.
e.
marshall
braden
--absolutely
correct.
