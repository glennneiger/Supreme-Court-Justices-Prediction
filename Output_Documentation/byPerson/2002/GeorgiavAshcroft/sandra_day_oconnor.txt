justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
on
that,
do
we
look
at
the
whole
state
and
what
would
happen
overall,
or
do
we
just
focus
on
individual
legislative
senatorial
districts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what...
what
ended
up
deciding
this
case
apparently
was
the
fact
that
in
three
of
the
districts
that
were
drawn
for
the
senate,
the
number
of
black
voters
decreased
under
the
new
plan
from
what
it
had
been,
and
they
had
been
very
safe
districts--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--assured
of
electing
black
officials
before,
and
it
was
reduced
to
around
50
percent.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
that
the
finding
of
the
court
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
really
haven't
equated
section
2
challenges
with
section
5
challenges.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
that's
what
you're
arguing,
but
we
have
not
done
that.
and
we
have
said
that
section
5
prevents
retrogression.
so
i
think
this
case
boils
down
to
what
amounts
to
retrogression.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in...
in
preclearing,
does
the
government
look
at
the
effect
as
a
whole?
what
if,
under
the
plan,
it's
true
that
the
districts
reduced
the
black
voter
population
somewhat
from
the
prior
districting,
but
in
so
doing,
they
picked
up
enough
black
voters
in
another
district
that
gave
them
an
additional
elected
official
of
the
minority
race--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and...
and
as
a
whole
might
be
better
off?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
do
look
at
it
as
a
whole.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
didn't
think
that
this
plan
resulted
in
a
gain
as
whole?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
if
it's
reduced
to
a
probably
will
elect?
more
likely
than
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
was
another
district,
senate
district
15,
where
the
percentage
dropped
from
62
percent
to
50.8
percent,
and
the
government
didn't
challenge
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
was
that...
where
did
i
get
the
notion
that
there
was
very
likely
going
to
be,
under
their
plan,
another
minority
official
elected--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
an
additional
district?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
braden,
i...
i
think
even
if
you're
correct
that
intervention
was
appropriate,
did
the
intervenors
join
in
the
appeal
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
why
isn't
it
moot
as
to
your
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
first
is
no.
02-182,
georgia
versus
ashcroft,
and
the
case
comes
to
us
from
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
colombia.
the
issue
is
whether
georgia’s
state
senate
redistricting
plan
should
have
been
precleared
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act,
whether
a
plan
should
be
precleared
depends
on
whether
the
change
in
voting
law
or
practice
would
lead,
as
the
statute
says,
would
lead
to
a
retrogression
in
the
position
of
racial
minorities
with
respect
to
their
effective
exercise
of
the
electoral
franchise.
the
question
then
is
whether
georgia’s
state
senate
redistricting
plan
is
retrogressive
as
compared
to
its
previous
benchmark
districting
plan.
the
parties
conceived
that
the
1997
georgia
plan
is
the
benchmark
plan
for
this
litigation,
because
it
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
more
recent
redistricting
effort.
the
1997
plan
drew
56
senate
districts,
ten
of
them
with
a
black
voting
age
population
of
over
50%.
after
the
2000
census,
the
georgia
general
assembly
began
the
process
of
redistricting
once
again.
the
goal
of
the
general
assembly
was
to
maintain
the
number
of
majority/minority
districts
and
also
increase
the
number
of
democratic
seats
in
the
state
senate.
the
plan
redistributed
some
of
the
black
voters
from
districts
with
a
heavy
concentration
of
minorities
and
placed
them
in
other
districts
to
create
more
districts
throughout
the
state
with
a
sizable
minority
population.
the
new
plan
drew
13
senate
districts
with
a
majority
black
voting
age
population.
13
additional
districts
with
a
black
voting
age
population
of
between
30
and
50%
and
four
other
districts
with
a
black
voting
age
population
of
between
25
and
30%.
georgia
filed
suit
as
it
was
permitted
to
do
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
its
plan
was
not
retrogressive
within
the
meaning
of
section
5.
the
district
court
refused
preclearance
because
in
three
senate
districts
of
the
new
plan,
a
lesser
opportunity
existed
for
the
black
candidate
of
choice
to
win
election
under
the
new
plan
than
under
the
benchmark
plan.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
we
now
vacate
the
judgment
below.
preliminarily,
the
district
court
properly
granted
the
motion
to
intervene
filed
by
private
parties.
private
parties
may
intervene
in
section
5
actions
assuming
they
need
the
requirements
of
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
24.
on
the
merits,
we
reject
georgia’s
argument
that
a
plan
should
be
precleared
under
section
5
if
the
plan
would
satisfy
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act,
because
section
2
and
section
5
address
different
evils,
and
as
in
a
previous
case
from
this
court,
we
decline
to
equate
a
section
2
vote
dilution
inquiry
with
the
section
5
retrogression
standard.
georgia
also
argues
that
even
if
compliance
with
section
2
does
not
automatically
result
in
preclearance
for
section
5
purposes,
its
state
senate
plan
should
be
precleared
because
it
does
not
lead
to
a
retrogression
in
black
voter’s
effective
exercise
of
the
electoral
franchise.
while
we
have
never
determined
the
meaning
of
the
language
effective
exercise
of
the
electoral
franchise,
this
case
requires
us
to
do
so
in
some
detail.
first,
we
think
the
inquiry
must
encompass
the
entire
statewide
redistricting
plan
as
a
whole;
second,
any
assessment
of
the
retrogression
of
a
minority
groups
effective
exercise
of
the
electoral
franchise
depends
on
an
examination
of
all
the
relevant
circumstances
such
as
the
ability
of
minority
voters
to
elect
candidates
of
their
choice
and
the
extent
of
the
minority
groups
opportunity
to
participate
in
a
political
process.
with
respect
to
the
ability
of
minority
voter’s
ability
to
elect
a
candidate
of
choice,
section
5
gives
the
state
some
selectability
to
choose
one
theory
of
effective
representation
over
another.
with
respect
to
the
minority
groups’
opportunity
to
participate
in
a
political
process,
the
court
should
examine
among
other
things
whether
the
new
plan
adds
or
subtracts
districts
where
minority
voters
can
play
a
substantial
even
if
not
decisive
role
in
the
electoral
process,
and
whether
the
representatives
elected
for
majority/minority
districts
supports
the
new
districting
plan.
we
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
remand
the
case
for
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
georgia
has
met
its
burden
approved
under
the
somewhat
broader
legal
standard
than
district
court
employed.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justices
stevens,
ginsburg,
and
breyer.
