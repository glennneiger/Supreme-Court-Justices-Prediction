do
the
findings
tell
us
whether
there's
been
any
change
in
the
last
few
years
in
the
amount
of
white
crossover
voting?
it
seems
to
me
there's
some
anecdotal
evidence
to
that
effect.

were
they
based
on
evidence
during
the
last
few
years,
or
back
in
the
'80s
and
'90s?

--yes,
but
don't
the
figures--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--don't
the
figures
show
that
some
of
the
districts
were
way
up
there
before,
were...
were
packed
and
they
reduced
them
something
like
80
percent
to
55
or
60?
doesn't
that
fit
precisely
under
what
justice
scalia
described?
