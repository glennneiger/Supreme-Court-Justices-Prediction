mr.
david
f.
walbert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
some
6
decades
now,
the
policy
of
the
united
states
has
been
to
embrace
integration,
reject
segregation
and
separation
of
people.
we
stand...
really,
the
nation
of
the
united
states
of
america
stands
pretty
much
as
the
beacon
in
the
world
to
the
notion
that
balkanization
is
not
the
way
to
go.
particularly
in
public
affairs
and
in
public
life,
integration,
working
together,
not
separating
people
on
the
basis
of
race
is
our
goal.
this
court
started
that
trend,
that
great
trend,
in
the
early...
in
the
1940s
with
the
original
decisions
of
smith
versus
allright,
putting
aside
segregation,
the
past
history
of
that
in
this
country,
the
icc,
interstate
commerce
commission
desegregation
decisions,
brown
versus
board
of
education,
voting
rights
cases,
jury
cases,
and
so
on.
and
the
policy
of
the
united
states,
as
this
court
was
the
leader
on
that
at
all
times,
has
always
been...
has
been
for
integration,
for
treating
people
the
same
independent
of
their
color.
congress
followed
behind
this
court,
started
adopting
some
of
the
early
civil
rights
act
in
the
early
1950s,
the
more
moderate
ones,
if
you
will,
under...
under
president
eisenhower's
administration,
and
of
course,
the
great
civil
rights
act
of
1964
was
enacted.
1965,
voting
rights
was
enacted;
and
the
1968
open
housing
act.
throughout
that
entire
time,
the
policy
of
integration
has
been
the
policy
that
this
nation
has
embraced
and
espoused
and
advocated.
and
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
respectfully
that
the
state
of
georgia...
the
position
the
state
of
georgia
puts
before
this
court
in
this
case
today
stands
four
square
in
the
center
of
that
tradition.
georgia
comes
here
to
this
court
today
advocating
that
politics
should
be
open
and
integrated.
politics
should
not
have
allocations
unnecessarily,
in
particular,
of
seats
based
on
race.
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
what
we
say
is
totally
consistent
with
everything
this
court
has
said
that
touches
upon
this
matter
and
in
this
particular
regard.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
yes,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
was
going...
excuse
me.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well,
i
think
you
look
at
both,
and
when
you
look
at
the
whole
plan
of
redistricting,
then
you
go
down
to
look
at
the
district.
you
can't
do
one
without
the
other.
one
looks
at,
first
of
all,
the
whole
plan
and
sees
if
opportunities
are
the
same
in
terms
of
majority
and
minority
seats,
for
example,
or
opportunities
where
minorities
have
a
real
opportunity
get
election,
and
sees
whether
that,
under
the
whole
plan,
is
the
same
and
whether
that's
been
maintained.
and
to
do
that,
though,
one
has
to
look--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
that's
correct.
the...
the
likelihood
of
winning...
the...
the
black
voter
age
population
was
reduced
to
about
50
percent--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--which
according
to
the
evidence,
would
give
about
a
75
percent
chance
of
a
minority
candidate
of
choice
winning
in
that
particular
district.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
the
finding
was
that
safe
seats...
the
rule
of
law
was
that
safe
seats
must
be
maintained.
to
get
a
safe
seat
here,
one
had
to
raise
these
4
to
5
percent.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i...
i
think
it
understates
it
a
little
bit,
in
all
due
respect,
justice
souter,
because
i
think
the
district
court
came
squarely
down.
if
you
look
at
the
majority
opinions...
and
both
judge
sullivan
and
judge
edwards
wrote
ones
that
were
concurred
in
about
each
other...
and
judge
oberdorfer's
decision,
the
line
is
safe
seats.
one
must
maintain
safe
seats.
and
i
think
the
only
way
that
those
can
be
looked
at
in
this
case
is
that
all
of
the
evidence
is...
when
you
get
to
that
level,
no
one
has
ever...
on
an
open
seat
in
georgia,
no
one's
ever
lost
a
54
percent
bvap
seat.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i...
i
agree
entirely
with
that,
your
honor.
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
they
are
requiring
more
than
that.
the
fact
is
that
these
districts
that
evolved
demographically
from
the
1990
census,
when
two
more
districts
under
the
old
districting
plan
became
majority
minority,
became
high
bvap...
let's
take
senate
district
26,
for
example.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well,
i
would
say
this.
where
you
have
a
real
equal
opportunity
at
winning
the
seat,
that
is
enough.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well,
i
think
this,
your
honor.
i
mean,
the...
the
court
accepted
dr.
epstein's
probability
curve
all
over...
any
number
of
times.
i
think
it
was
on
page
36
the
first
time.
dr.
epstein's
evidence
is...
his
study
is
reliable
and
relevant
is
what
the
court
says
in
that
regard.
and
i
guess
the
critical
thing
is
that
was
the
only
evidence
in
this
case,
plus
the
legislators
who
testified,
and...
and
congressman
lewis
who
testified
about
the
likelihood
of
winning
at
a
50
percent
bvap
level.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well,
i
think
the
bottom
line
standard
of
safe
seat
is
the
problem
that
we
have.
i'm
not
sure
that...
they
didn't
speak
of
robust
campaigning,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
kennedy.
it
was
robust
districts,
meaning...
they
equated
that
with
safe.
and
the...
the
point...
that
is
the
legal
issue.
that
is
the
fundamental
legal
flaw
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority
below
that
we
take
issue
with,
the
fact
that
one
must
maintain
safe
seats
and--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--that--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--i--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
first,
that's
not
what
happened
in
the
record.
professor
engstrom
gave
no
testimony.
there
was
no
testimony
but
from
our
side
of
the
case
about
the
likelihood
of
winning.
professor
engstrom
came
in
and
said
there
is
racially
polarized
voting,
and
he
criticized
that
and
the
department
criticized
it,
and
it
was
relied
upon.
but
the
african
american
candidates
were
winning
in
election
after
election
after
election
in
which
he
said
there
is
a
problematic
racially
polarized
voting.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
no,
you
do
not.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
the
rule
of
law
that
was
established
here
by
the
majority
of
having
to
maintain...
having
to
maintain
a
safe
seat.
there's
no
question
they're
not
saying
you
have
to
create
one
if
there
wasn't
one,
but
the
question
is,
do
you
have
to
maintain
a
seat
that's
safe?
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--there's
two
reasons.
and...
and
first
of
all,
no
one
disagrees
that
lowering
the
percentage
and
the
likelihood
down...
the...
we're
not...
no
one
in
this
case,
including
the
district
court,
says
you
can't
lower
the
probabilities.
so
what
your
honor
is
saying
is
a
position
more
extreme
than
what
the
majority
says
below.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
and...
and
my
point
is
that
he
is
conceding
that
dropping
down
from
a
certain
seat
to
a
safe
seat
is
okay.
now,
how
does
that...
how
can
that
possibly
square
to
the
notion
of
retrogression?
everybody
agrees
in
this
courtroom,
including
the
majority
below,
that
there
can
be
decreases
in
the
likelihood
of
success.
the
only
question
in
this
court...
in
this
case
is
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
safe
or
equal
seats?
safe
is
just
out
of
the
air.
never
before
in
the
history
of
this
court
has
anyone
ever
said
safe
is
the...
is
the
plimsoll
line
or
the
water
line
beyond
which
you
cannot
drop.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well,
safe
is--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--and
that's
what
the...
and
the
court
is
acknowledging
that
there
is
a
drop
for
sure.
the
court
said--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--i
don't
think
that
could
be,
because--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--no,
it
doesn't
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
when
you
get
to
the
levels
they're
talking
about,
there
is
still
a
possibility
for
sure,
whether
it's
20
percent
or
whatever,
but
that's
a
real
possibility.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
they
used
different
legal
standards,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
breyer.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
safe
versus
equal.
that
is
the
difference
in
the
legal
standards
between
the
majority
and...
and
the
decision
below.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
because
i
think
it's
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
has
said
on
section
5
before.
and
if
i
might
read
several
of
the...
just
a
sentence.
and
i'm
going
to
start
with
justice
marshall,
who
was
the
most
aggressive
interpreter
and
advocate
of
what
section
5
would
mean.
and
in
his
dissent,
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
mississippi
in
1980,
he
three
times
addressed
what
section
5
requires
in
a
retrogression
context.
and
he
said
in
the
first
thing,
it
requires
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
elect
a
candidate
of
their
choice.
that
is
what
a
district
had
to
be
maintained
like
under
justice
marshall's
interpretation
of
section
5.
that's
on
page
1055
of
that
decision.
again,
on
the
next...
on
page
1057,
justice
marshall
says,
the
numbers
must
be
sufficient
to
provide,
quote,
a
fair
opportunity
to
elect
candidates,
unquote.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
and...
and
that's
in
section
5
under
justice
marshall
is
all
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
because
this
issue
that
is
in
this
case
today
has
never
been
squarely
put
before
this
court.
but
all
the
prior
language
of
the
court
interpreting,
where
does
section
5
kick
in
when
there
is
still
fair,
equal
districts.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--i
think
the
problem,
though,
judge...
and...
and
certainly
you
start
with
backsliding
and
retrogression,
but
the
question
is,
where
does
inquiry
stop?
truly,
you
could
say
at
a
100
percent
district
goes
down
to
80
percent,
the
chances
clearly
change
on
electoral
success,
without
a
doubt.
that
is
inevitable.
goes
from
100
to
60,
100
to
55.
that
is
a
real
and
palpable
change.
that
is
okay,
according
to
the
district
court,
because
at
least
we
stopped
at
safe.
that's
our
problem.
we
don't
think
safe
is
where
you
arbitrarily
draw
the
line
to
stop.
no
decision
of
this
court
ever
has
suggested
that
before.
so
is--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--in
our
view
of
section
5,
so
long
as...
if
you
have
a
district
that
is...
that
it
has
at
least
an
equal
opportunity,
it
must
be
maintained
in
that
fashion.
if
you
have
a...
a
district
where
minorities
have
an
equal
opportunity
or
better,
to
prevail
and
to
control.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
if
you
go...
excuse
me.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
if
the
evidence
in
a
particular
case
would
show
that,
that...
you
know,
we
never
went
below
50
on
anything,
so
that's
not
here
in
this
case.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
well,
i
think
the
problem
is
this,
though,
your
honor.
where...
what
would
be
the
policy
reason
where
a
section
of
the
voting
rights
act,
section
5,
could
be
construed
to
mandate
a
state
to
maintain
something
more
than
what
federal
law
could
possibly
compel
it
to
under
section
2?
mr.
david
f.
walbert
section
5
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
it's
abridge--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--it's
abridge
or
deny
the
right
to
vote--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
section
5?
mr.
david
f.
walbert
no.
congress
passed
the
statute...
section
5
in
1965
because
they
were
concerned
about
voter
registration
laws
changing
after--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--it
was...
it
was
passed
to
dovetail
with
the
literacy
test.
that's
why
it
was
passed.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
sure,
it
does,
as
been
interpreted
by
this
court
since
then,
but
the
original
reason
why
it
was
passed
was
to
fit
in
with
the
literacy
test.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
equal
opportunity,
yes,
your
honor.
and...
and
our
reasoning
on
that
is...
is
a
simple
thing.
if
one
looks
at
it
from
the
other
side,
and...
and
we're
not
saying
section
2
is
incorporated
in
section
5.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
cannot
be
the
abridgement
of
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
it's...
it's
implicit
in
what
we
did
because
we
looked
at
the
whole
election
scheme.
everything
that
dr.
epstein
did
was
the
whole
election.
dr.
engstrom
made
no
distinction
between
nonpartisan
elections,
generals,
and
primaries.
he
lumped
them
all
together
and
treated
them
in
one
ball
of
wax.
we
certainly
did,
and
our
evidence
always
looked
at
winning/winning,
winning
the
seat.
if
you
won
the
primary
and
lost
the
seat,
you're
a
loser
because
we're
talking
about
winning
the
election.
that's
all
we
looked
at.
if
you
didn't
win
it,
we
didn't
count
it.
but
the
thing
that
is
the
most
troubling,
i
guess,
in
this
regard
that
is...
and
the
reason
i
looked
to
section
2
is
not
that
section
2
is
incorporated
in
here,
but
if
you
assume
that
section
2
was
proved...
that
a
plaintiff
came
in
and
proved
a
section
2
violation
in
georgia,
what
would
be
the
high
water
mark
relief
that
they
would
get?
they
would
get
under
justice
souter's
opinion
for
the
court
in
johnson
versus
degrandy
a
district
with
an
equal
opportunity
to
prevail.
that--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
and
i
think,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect
here,
i
believe
that
the
problem
with
interpreting
it
to
be
an
absolutist
at
the
safe
seat
level,
you've
got
to...
in
our
opinion...
and
we
raised
the
issue,
of
course...
it's
a
grave
constitutional
question.
what
is
the
legitimate
ends?
what
is
the
legitimate
ends
into...
i
think
the
court's
discussion
in
city
of
boerne
versus
florida
is
the
most
detailed
discussion
recently
about
section
5
enforcement
power
under
the
14th
and
section
2
under
the
15th...
and
everybody
on
the
court
agreed
with
the
formulation
there.
the
ends
of
congress
must
be
legitimate
and
the
ends
must
be
related
proportionately
and
with
congruence,
the...
the
remedies
that
are
chosen
by
congress.
and
i
would
have
to
say
what
is...
other
than
just
preserving
what
happens
to
be
there...
the
only
reason
we're
talking
about
keeping
safe
seats
is
they
happen
to
be
there.
this
is
not
because
they're
ever
put
in
because
of
a
remedy.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
that's
a
different
question
surely,
but
no,
i
would
say
it's
not,
your
honor.
i
think
as
long
as
it's
not--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--excuse
me.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
correct.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
think
that
is
within
the
state's
prerogative
so
long
as--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--you
know--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--i'm
going
to
add
on
the
last
part
of
that.
so
long
as
it's
not
the
predominant
reason
for
the
way
the
lines
are
drawn
is
how
i
was
going
to
try
and
answer
the...
the
rest
of
the
last
question.
so
the
state
can
do
it.
and...
and
it
is
illegitimate
in
this
sense,
your
honor,
because
you're
getting
back
to
the
question
about
why
didn't
the
state
do
it,
which
is
almost
like
bossier
ii.
what's
the
purpose
and
so
on
behind
it?
so
long
as
we
maintain
a
system
that
satisfies
the...
what
i
would
call
the
high
water
liability
remedy
level
of
section
2,
that
has
got
to
be
enough.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
several
things.
first
of
all,
the
history
your
honor
cites,
which
is
correct
in
some
regards,
has
nothing
to
do
with
redistricting
history
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
georgia
at
least.
we
have
eight--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
i
think
insofar
as
you're
trying
to
apply
that
in
interpreting
section
5
in
this
context,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
realistic
way
of
interpreting
it
here
because
of
that
history.
if
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
segregation
and
so
on
before
1965,
a
horrible
history
before
1965,
that
that
was
enough
to
justify
in
the
year
2003
where
african
americans
are
demonstrably
having
success
that
no
one
would
have
dreamed
of
in
1965
in
the
state
of
georgia...
in
a
26
percent
black
state,
one-quarter
of
the
statewide
elected
officials
are
african
american
today
in
the
state
of
georgia.
and
to
say
that
it
is
necessary
is
so
divorced
from
the
factual
reality
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
fair
factual
predicate
to
apply
that
constitutionally
to
the
state
of
georgia
at
this
time
in
history.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
would
say
that's
punting
the
court's
constitutional
and
statutory
interpretation
duty
to
a
coincidence
of
time
like
that,
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor.
we
have
this
case
today.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
and
what
georgia
can
do
today
is
the
questions
before
this
court.
and
the
fact
that
congress
may
or
may
not...
any
law
that
ever
comes
before
this
court
may
be
repealed
the
next
week.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
but
it
is
always--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--it's
a
de
facto
extension
as
a
practical
matter.
there
is
no
real
likelihood
that
section
5
will
not
be
extended
as
a
practical
matter.
that's
been
true
in
'70,
'75,
'82.
whether
it
will
be
for
25
years,
20
or
50
or
become
permanent
this
time,
i
don't
know.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
don't
know
about
that,
judge.
we
don't
have
a
problem
with
section
5.
it's
the
way
it
would
be
applied
if
the
district
court
were
affirmed
in
this
case.
and
the
difficulty
is
that
just
the
whole
notion
of
making
section
5
compel
more
than
the
substance
of
section
2
in
a
redistricting
context,
there's
a
grave
illogic
about
that
given
the
narrow
purpose
of
section
5
which
is
always
the
freeze
and
the
backslide,
the
emergencies.
don't...
don't
let
anything
bad
happen.
if
what
your
honor
just
said,
justice
souter,
if
it
happened
that
there
was
a
mistake
and,
oh,
my
gosh,
it
really...
the
world
changed
in
georgia
and
55
percent
or
50
percent
wasn't
equal
and
it
turned...
and
40
percent
wasn't
and
it
had
to
go
back
up
to
60...
let's
take
an
unimaginably
bad
situation...
section
2
is
still
there.
section
5
could
be
applied.
section
5
is
a
stopgap,
extraordinarily
harsh
statute
that
is
unique.
it
is
unique
in
our
federal
system.
and
the
answer,
i
truly
believe,
to
your
honor's
question
is
section
2
is
always
there
if
any
of
those
kind
of
parade
of
horribles,
if
you
will...
if
the
expectation
of
equality
disappeared.
but
we're
dealing
with
the
facts
of
today,
and
the
facts
of
today
at
the
time
of
this
trial
showed
equality
was
absolutely
established
at
the
level
that
we
were
talking
about.
and
that
is
the
problem
with
this
case
that
is
before
this
court
today.
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
think
of
one
question
here,
and
it
is
this
question.
is
it
remotely
realistic
in
the
real
world
that
43
out
of
45
african
american
legislators
who
are
the
most
sophisticated,
knowledgeable
african
americans
about
politics
and
winning
and
political
power
and
electoral
power
would
have
voted
for
this
if
it
did
all
these
bad
things,
if
this
wasn't
the
best
way
they
could
see
of
enhancing
the
power?
is
that
conceivable?
it's
not
conceivable.
that's...
that's
fanciful.
one
can't
possibly
say
that's
possible.
and--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
there's...
that's
realistic
to
think
that
the
delegation
would
vote
themselves
out
of
office,
which
is
what
we're
talking
about.
are
they
making
their
districts
so
weak
they're
voting
themselves
out
of
office?
no.
their
testimony
is
unequivocal
that
this
enhances
black
voting
strength
because...
and
the
solicitor
general
was
wrong
when
he
says
there's
no
testimony
that
the
other
districts
would
be
enhanced.
there
is
no
testimony
that
any
other
districts
would
become
safe
seats,
but
from
a
black
point
of
view,
absolutely.
when
you're
shifting
the
black
votes
into
those
other
districts,
the
potential
is
enhancing,
the
potential
of
getting
someone
the
democrats
prefer
who
happens
to
be
white.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
that's
in
the
testimony
of
every
one
of
the
legislators,
said
that's
why
we
get--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--it
would
be
in
the...
it's
in
the...
the
testimony
of
the
legislators.
it
would
be
in
the
proposed--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--it's...
i'm
sorry.
it's
the
testimony
of
the
legislators.
some
little
bit
of
it
is
quoted
in
our
brief.
it's
in
the
proposed
findings
of
fact
in
great
detail,
but
it's
the
testimony
of
the
legislators.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
i
would
think
that's
a
fair
characterization,
your
honor.
as
a
practical
matter,
it
would
be
a
tragedy.
and
we're
well
aware
of
the
history.
we're
not
up
here
apologizing
that
we
are
disowning
the
history
of
race
in
georgia.
we
know
what
it
is.
the
attorney
general
knows
what
it
is.
but
it
would
be
a
tragedy
on
the
facts
of
this
case
to
utilize
that
history
to
penalize
what
african
americans
are
trying
to
do...
tried
to
do
in
this
reapportionment
under
this
evidence.
integration's
working
in
georgia.
we
have
the
most
politically
integrated
political
system
probably
in
the
united
states.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
no.
we
look
at
the
success
of
what
the
record
unequivocally
and
without
contradiction
demonstrates
in
terms
of
african
american
success
in
the
state
of
georgia,
and
it's
a
compelling
record,
your
honor.
it
shows
again
that
we
have
4
congressmen
out
of
13
who
are
african
american,
52
percent
district,
50
percent
district,
41
percent
district,
and
38
percent
district.
last
one
just
elected
13...
congressional
district
13
just
created...
this
reapportionment
got
two
new
districts.
13
was
open,
38
percent,
african
american
elected.
african
american
elected
in
the
last
election
in
a
28
percent
multi-member
house
district.
it's
working.
mr.
david
f.
walbert
yes.
there's
oral
argument
next
week
on
that,
your
honor,
and
we
expect
that
to
be
decided
very
quickly.
there
is,
of
course,
your
favorable
from
our
position
from
the
superior
court.
that's
on
direct
appeal
to
the
supreme
court,
oral
argument
next
week
and
that
will
in
all
likelihood
be
decided
very,
very
promptly.
so--
and
i
think
that...
what
is
the
reason...
putting
all
these
facts
aside,
which
are
compelling,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
section
5--
mr.
david
f.
walbert
--thank
you,
your
honor.
