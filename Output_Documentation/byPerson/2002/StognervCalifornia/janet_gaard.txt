ms.
janet
gaard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
based
on
new
evidence
that
children
who
have
been
sexually
abused
often
delay
reporting
the
crimes
for
substantial
periods
of
time,
the
california
legislature
extended
the
statute
of
limitations
for
the
most
serious
of
these
offenses
and
it
expressly
made
the
law
retroactive.
this
law
does
not
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause
or
the
due
process
clause.
turning
first
to
ex
post
facto,
this
law
does
not
criminalize
conduct
that
was
innocent
when
it
was
done.
ms.
janet
gaard
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
ms.
janet
gaard
because
what
we're
looking
at
with
those
four
categories
is
what
the
law
was
in
effect
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed,
whether
or
not
it
was
an
innocent
act
that
was
later
criminalized.
a
pardon
has
no
effect
on
the...
whether
or
not
the
act
was
innocent
at
the
time
it
was
committed.
so
i
would
say
that
is
like
an
ex...
a
statute
of
limitations,
that
there
would
not
be
a
change
in
the
ex
post
facto.
ms.
janet
gaard
no.
it
would
be
treated
the
same
for
ex
post
facto
purposes.
ms.
janet
gaard
yes.
ms.
janet
gaard
with
an
amnesty,
i
don't...
i
believe
it
would
be
the
same
with
the
ex
post
facto.
there
may
be
some
separation
of
powers
issues.
there
may
be
double
jeopardy
issues,
and
there
may
be
due
process
issues.
i
suppose
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
ms.
janet
gaard
i
believe
that
they
actually
would
be
very
similar,
but
it
would
depend.
i
think
sometimes
amnesties
are
conditional
or
some--
ms.
janet
gaard
--an
unconditional?
ms.
janet
gaard
then
what
you
would
look
to
would
be
due
process
there,
which
you
also
can
look
to
with
an
ex
post
facto
change.
ms.
janet
gaard
i
don't
think
that
you
look
to
substantive
due
process.
i
believe
that
what
was
expressed
earlier
is
when
we
have
an
explicit
textual
source
of
protection,
which
we
have
here,
you
don't
look
to
substantive
due
process.
the
protection
comes
by
way
of
procedural
due
process.
ms.
janet
gaard
yes,
i
believe
it
would
be,
your
honor.
ms.
janet
gaard
yes.
ms.
janet
gaard
without
violating
the
ex
post
facto
clause--
ms.
janet
gaard
--yes.
and
the
ex
post
facto
clause
has
been
interpreted
in
terms
of
the
four
calder
categories.
what
i'd
like
to
do
is...
is
focus
primarily
on
categories
one
and
four
which
this
court
has
said
are
mirror
images
of
each
other.
the
first
category
prevents
the
state
from
making
an
act
that
was
innocent
when
it
was
committed
criminal
at
a
later
time.
it
provides
fair
warning
so
that
citizens
are
able
to
assess
whether
or
not
to
engage
in
certain
conduct.
and
it's
related
to
guilt
or
innocence.
the
statute
of
limitations
has
no
relation
to
guilt
or
innocence.
it's
a
defense
that's
raised
that
says
whether
or
not
the
defendant
committed
the
crime,
the
state
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
prosecute.
and
when
you
look
at
whether
or
not
the
crime
existed,
what
you
look
at
is
the
definition
of
the
crime
as
set
forth
by
the
elements.
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
frazer
opinion,
footnote
22,
where
the
california
supreme
court
has
said,
whatever
its
nature
for
various
state
law
purposes,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense
insofar
as
the
definition
of
criminal
conduct
occur.
the
california
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
crime
that's
at
issue
in
this
case
is
set
forth
in
penal
code
section
288,
and
the
statute
of
limitations
has
no
relation
to
that.
interplaying
with
the
category
one
is
category
four.
ms.
janet
gaard
i
believe
when
you're
talking
about
increasing
the
punishment,
what...
what
the...
the
cases
have
looked
at
is
the
punishment
that
exists
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
and
it
really
is
the
actual
punishment
whether
or
not
the
term
of
a
punishment
is
1
year
or
it's
20
years,
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
authority--
ms.
janet
gaard
--the
second
calder
category,
if
we
look
back
at
the
historical
basis
for
that,
comes
from
the
creation
of
a
new
punishment
that
wasn't
in
effect
at
the
time.
ms.
janet
gaard
well,
i...
i
don't
think
so
because
the
second
one
was,
for
example,
where
the
new
punishment
that
was
imposed
was
banishment
which
didn't
exist
at
the
time
as
a
penalty
for
the
prescribed
crime.
the
third
one
is
the
increase
in
the
punishment.
but
creating
a
new
punishment,
i
don't
think
that
holding
a
defendant
liable
for
a
longer
period
of
time
is
the
type
of
punishment
that
this
court
has
looked
at
when
it
has
applied
those
cases.
what
we're
looking
at
is
the
purposes
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
which
is
to
provide
fair
warning
so
that
he
knows
whether
or
not
he
should
commit
the
crime.
ms.
janet
gaard
excuse
me?
ms.
janet
gaard
this
is
not
such
a
case,
and
in
fact,
the
california--
ms.
janet
gaard
--if
you're--
ms.
janet
gaard
--i
guess
you
have...
you
have
touched
on
a
couple
of
things.
first
is
repose
and
second
is
potential
for
prejudice.
and
the
potential
for
prejudice
exists
because
of
the
passage
of
time,
not
necessarily
because
of
the
retroactive
change.
so
the
fact
that
the
evidence
may
be
somewhat
stale
is
a
function
of
the
mere
passage
of
time,
and
as
the
court
is
aware,
there...
the
state
could
impose
no
statute
of
limitations
so
we
could
have
a
case
that
was
40
years
out
and
that
would
be
the
same
issue.
but
in
terms
of--
ms.
janet
gaard
--the
court
has
said,
and
similar,
but
this
court
has
repeatedly
held,
most
recently
in
carmell
in
2000,
that
the
four
calder
categories
are
the
outside
parameters,
and
that
a
law,
to
be
ex
post
facto,
needs
to
fall
within
one-fourth
of...
one
of
those
four.
and
in
terms
of
the
prejudice,
there
is
protection--
ms.
janet
gaard
--but
i
believe
what
the
court
said
there
was
that
what
was
impermissible
or
unfair
was
undermining
a
presumption
of...
of
innocence,
and
that's
not
relative
when
you
have
a
statute
of
limitations.
innocence
is
of
no
import.
so
what
the
court
said
was
in
calder
category
one,
you
cannot
change
the
elements
of
the
crime
retroactively,
and
in
calder
category
four,
it
said
you
can't
change
what
the
prosecution
has
to
prove
with
respect
to
those
four...
or
those
elements.
so
you
can't
change
the
presumption
of
innocence,
which
the
court
spoke
to
in
the
cummings
case,
and
you
can't
lower
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
required
to
prove
the
elements
of
the
crime,
which
is
what
the
court
was
saying
in
calder.
and
in
fact,
if
you
find
that
changing
this
would...
would
implicate
the
fourth
calder
category,
then
you
may
want
to
look
at
gut
v.
minnesota
where
the
court
held
that
a
change
in
a
venue
did
not
implicate
any
of
the
four
calder
categories.
and
if
you
were
to
change
venue,
that
would
also
change
the
fourth
calder
category
which
this
would.
and
also--
ms.
janet
gaard
--no.
i
think
what
that
would
be
is
so
long
as
the
statute
of
limitations
has
expired
and
not
been
revived,
that
there
is
no
present
threat
of
prosecution--
ms.
janet
gaard
--yes,
but
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
suppress
that
statement
because
it
would
be
unfair.
that
would
be
an
act
of
misleading
by
the
state
to
say
you
would
have
to...
to
testify
and
then
we're
going
to
use
it
against
you.
so
as
we
said,
we
don't
believe
this
fits
within
the...
one
of
the
four
calder
categories,
but
the
protections
come
by
way
of...
or
the
procedural
component
of
the
due
process
clause,
that
if
in
fact
there
has
been
actual
prejudice,
the...
the
defendant
may
raise
that
as
he
may
in
any
instance
where
there
is
a
pretrial
delay,
and
then
the
court
will
weigh
that
versus
the
reasons
for
the
delay,
which
is
the
test
that
this
court--
ms.
janet
gaard
--yes,
it
would
be.
whenever
there's
pretrial
delay,
you
use
the
test
that
the
court
enunciated
in
marion
and
reiterated
in
lovasco,
and
that's
where
we
believe
the
protections
come
here.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
demurrer.
there
has
been
no
allegation
by
the
defendant
that
he's
been
prejudiced
in
any
way
in
his
ability
to
present
a
defense.
ms.
janet
gaard
i
don't
think
that
that
was
the
intent
at
the
time
that
this
was--
ms.
janet
gaard
--if
we
look
at
the
historical
basis
for
this,
it
was
the
creation
of
a--
ms.
janet
gaard
--it
was
the
creation--
ms.
janet
gaard
--yes.
it
was
the
creation
of
a
new
punishment.
i
don't
think
they
had...
that
it
was
meant
to
be
a
catchall,
and
this
court
has
never
interpreted
it
to
be
a
catchall.
ms.
janet
gaard
it
has
not
said
it
is
not,
as
far
as
i'm
aware.
ms.
janet
gaard
and
i
think
that
justice
kennedy
mentioned
about
the
extensions,
and
one
of
the
things
that
you
need
to
look
at
is
when
you're...
you're
deciding
whether
or
not
an
extension
of
the
statute
of
limitations
that
isn't
applied
retroactively
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
we
look
to
a
defense
that
existed
at
the
time
the
act
was
committed.
and
if
he
had
a
3-year
statute
of
limitations
at
the
time
the
act
was
committed,
you
would
be
changing
the
evidence,
if
you
followed
his
theory,
from
3
years
to
an
extended
period,
whether
or
not
it
was
an
extension
or
a
revival.
so
we
don't
think
that
that
would
work,
and
this
court
would
actually
have
to
overrule
a
long
line
of
cases
saying
that
extensions
are
also
permissible.
and
the...
the
federal
district...
or
courts
of
appeals,
several
of
them
have
spoken
about
the
fact
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
not
the
type
of
element
that
we're
looking
for
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
change
in
the--
ms.
janet
gaard
--in
this--
ms.
janet
gaard
--may
i
answer?
ms.
janet
gaard
in
california,
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
a
pretrial
hearing
on
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
if
the
court
finds
that
the
statute
of
limitations'
exceptions
have
not
been
met,
the
defendant
gets
a
dismissal.
if
it
goes
to
trial,
the
court
makes
a
determination...
or
the
jury
makes
a
determination.
they
first
find
guilt
or
not
guilt,
and
then
they
make
findings
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence--
