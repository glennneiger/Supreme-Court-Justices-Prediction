unknown
speaker
were
those
state
law
cases
and
state
constitutional
cases?
unknown
speaker
did
he
base
his
decision,
the
one
that
you're
referring
to,
on
the
ex
post
facto
clause?
unknown
speaker
we've
said
in
graham
against
connor
that
if
a
provision
of
the
constitution
speaks
directly
to
a
subject
matter,
such
as
i
think
the
ex
post
facto
clause
does
to
your
case
here,
then
we
don't
go
to
substantive
due
process.
we
analyze
it
just
under
that
provision.
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
go
to
the
kind
of
evidence
necessary
to
prove
the
substantive
offense
certainly.
unknown
speaker
but
that...
that
simply
says
there
is
another
substantive
element
there.
it
doesn't
say
what
rule
of
evidence
you
follow
to
decide
how
that
was
made
out.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
have
a...
a
case
in
which
the
statute
of
limitations
has
not
yet
expired,
and
the
legislature
then
extends
it.
and
it's
during
the
extended
period
that
the
prosecution
has
brought
it.
is
there
an
ex
post
facto
violation
there?
unknown
speaker
and
how
does
that
fit
in
with
the
description
you
just
gave
of...
about
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
the
ultimate
conclusion
they
gave.
the
case
i
put
to
you
is
either
barred
or
it
isn't.
we
have
to
find
the
answer
to
that
before
we
know
whether
there's
evidence.
i...
i
just...
i
just
don't
understand
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
but
why
isn't
any
evidence
in...
in
one
case
or
the
other
in
the
hypothetical
i
put?
unknown
speaker
except
it
does
if
you're...
if
you're
right
on
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
another
question
on
the
ex
post
facto
lawsuit.
suppose
the
state
has
a
savings
clause
and
it
reserves
to
itself
the
right
to
extend
any
statute
of
limitations.
what
result
there
if
the
state
then
extends
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
this
was...
and
then
this
in
effect
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed,
this
general
power
in
the
state
to
extend.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you're
not
arguing
for
very
much
here.
the...
the
states...
all
the
states
can
just
pass
this
statute
and...
and
that's
the
end
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
what...
what
if
a
state
says
we
reserve
the
right
to
dispense
with
any
of
the
elements
of...
of
crime
that
are
on
our
books?
i
mean,
it
announces
that.
we
reserve
the
right
in
the
future
to
dispense
with...
retroactively
with
any
of
the
elements
of
the
crimes
that
we
have
defined
in
our...
in
our
code.
you
wouldn't
say
that's
okay,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
why
is
this
any
different?
i...
i
don't
know.
if
it
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
i
can't
see
how
the
state
can
get
around
it
by
announcing
in
advance
that
it's
going
to...
to
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
how
does
that
make
it
okay?
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
run.
the
state
announces
it
in
advance.
then
the
statute
runs,
and
the
state
says,
hey,
we
told
you.
we
told
you
beforehand
that
even
after
the
statutes
run,
we're
going
to
be
able
to
get
you.
and
i
thought
you
said
that's
okay.
unknown
speaker
that...
that
was
the
footnote
in
the
falter
case?
unknown
speaker
footnote
26
or
something?
now,
that
has
never
been
approved
by
this
court.
have...
have
various
circuit
courts
approved
of
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
california
supreme
court,
in
announcing
under
state
law,
didn't
give
it
that
fundamental
sweep
at
all.
unknown
speaker
we're
bound
by
what...
how
california
characterizes
its
own
statute
i
assume.
unknown
speaker
but
we...
we
have
to...
we
have
to
take
the
state
law
as
we...
as
we
find
it.
i
mean,
if
the
supreme
court
of
california
says
a
law
meant
one
thing,
we
don't
come
in
and
say
it
meant
another.
we
can
say
you've
changed
the
law
and
therefore
it's
ex
post
facto,
but
we
don't
decide
for
ourselves
over
the...
overruling
a
state
court
what
that
particular
law
said
at
a
particular
time.
unknown
speaker
that...
that's
the
law
in
california,
what
you
just
said,
that
even
though
you
never
raise
it
as
a...
as
an
issue
in
your
trial,
and
you're
in...
you're
in
prison,
many
years
you
could
then
come
in
and
under
california
law
if
it...
if
the
statute
had
run,
you
would
be
released?
unknown
speaker
then...
then
what
was
the
effect
of
the
frazer
case?
unknown
speaker
so
did
the
frazer
case
overrule
some
of
this
california
doctrine
on
statute
of
limitations
that
you've
just
told
us
about?
unknown
speaker
mr.
najera,
could...
could
you
explain
to
me...
i...
i
understand
your
argument
that
this
falls
within
the
fourth
category
of
calder
because
you
have
to
produce
more
evidence
under
the...
or
i'm
sorry...
less
evidence.
it
alters
the
amount
of
evidence
necessary
for
conviction.
before
the
statute,
you...
you
had
to
show
that
the
crime
was
committed
by
an
earlier
date
and
after
this,
you
don't
have
to
show
it
was
committed
by
that
earlier
date.
but
if
that's
the
case,
what
i
don't
understand
is
why
it
makes
any
difference
whether
this
increase...
or
decrease
in
the
amount
of
evidence
necessary
to
convict
occurs
before
or
after
the
old
statute
of
limitations
has
run.
in
either
event,
it...
it
amounts
to
a
decrease
in
the
amount
of
evidence
necessary
to
convict.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
hear
you
but
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
really--
--i
suppose
you
could
also
say
that
even
though
literally
it
would
apply
to
both
situations,
there's
a
longstanding
tradition
of
not
applying
it
in
the
case
where
the
statute
has
not
run,
and
so
you
would
construe
that
exception
rather
narrowly.
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct...
just
so
i
get
your
view
on
it...
am
i
correct
that
with
respect
to
an
unexpired
statute
of
limitations
where
there's
an
attempt
by
the
legislature
to
extend
it,
the
law
is
really
very
well
settled
that
that's
permissible?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
just
replicates
the
third.
yes.
that
makes
it
totally
redundant.
unknown
speaker
my
other
case...
i
don't
know...
quite
know
how
the
statute
of
limitations
works
in
the
criminal
area.
in
the
civil
area,
you
can
very
easily
waive
the
statute
of
limitations
if
you
don't
plead
it
at
the
right
time
or
if
you
make
a
counterclaim
based
on
the
same
facts,
et
cetera.
in...
in
the
criminal
system,
are
statute
of
limitations
routinely
held
waived?
unknown
speaker
or...
or
on
the
other
hand,
after
the
fact
and
a
prisoner
could
say
i
forgot
there's
a
statute
of
limitations
here
and...
and
bring
collateral
attack?
unknown
speaker
--and
what's
the...
what's
the
answer
with
respect
to
a
state
pardon?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
mean,
i--
unknown
speaker
what--
unknown
speaker
so...
so
it
wouldn't
apply
at
all
here.
