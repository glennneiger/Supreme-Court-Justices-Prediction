justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
same...
that's
here.
isn't
that
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
isn't
that
present
here,
at
least
in
respect
to
the
evidence?
i
mean,
a
person
as...
as...
for
example,
this
particular
defendant
you
would
like
to
prosecute,
among
other
things,
for
crimes
that
were
committed
in
your
view
43
years
before
the
present...
before
the
time
of
indictment
and
22
years
anyway
since
the
statute
of
limitations
expired.
it's
quite
possible
that
during
that
time
people
would
have
thought
that
they
didn't
have
to
keep
records,
that
they
didn't
have
to
keep
all
the
evidence,
that
they
might
not
have
to
defend
themselves.
and
of
course,
there's
something
to
be
said
on
the
other
side,
but
also
memories
can
be
revived
through
hypnosis.
is
this
such
a
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
so...
so
then
i...
but...
but
there...
they
could
be,
and
sometimes
those
are
inaccurate.
so
people
feel
that
they
are
free
not
to
keep
the
evidence
after
22
years.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
i'm...
i'm
trying
to
trigger
your
reaction
as
to
some
of
these
fairly
obvious
points
as
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
the
point...
the
point,
of
course,
is
that...
that
in
calder
v.
bull,
the
justice
says,
all
these
and
similar
laws
are
manifestly
unjust
and
oppressive.
and
some
of
the
purposes
here,
particularly
the
ones
on
evidence
and
so
forth,
seem
to
be
about
the
kinds
of
things
you're
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
your
strongest
argument
against
justice
souter's
initial
point,
which
i
thought
was...
that
the
word
aggravated...
every
law
that
aggravates
a
crime,
treating
that
as
a
kind
of
catchall
where,
in
fact,
it
isn't
literally
within
the
other
three,
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
purposes,
it's
the
same.
the
argument
against
treating
that
aggravating
a
crime
as
a
kind
of
catchall
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
evidence
that
it
wasn't
the
intent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it...
it
was
the
banishment
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
could
treat
the
banishment
that
they
were
referring...
that
one
thing
or
that
they
were
treating
it
as
a
catchall.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
way
or
the
other,
or
has
it
said
it
isn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
legislative
amnesty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
your...
i
mean,
starting
your
basic
argument...
i
look
back.
i
see
learned
hand
says
that
after
the
period
is
run,
it
is
unfair
and
dishonest
to
prosecute
a
person.
it
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
after
the
civil
war,
roscoe
conkling,
a
hawk
i
think,
said
when
they
wanted
to
revive
treason
against
jefferson
davis,
he
said
that
the
offense
is
dead
if
the
statute
has
run.
it
would
be
ex
post
facto.
hornbook
law
like
american
jurisprudence
until
recently
said
absolutely
contrary
to
the
constitution.
so
what's
changed?
or
are...
in...
in
the
government's
view,
were
all
those
people...
they
weren't
supreme
courts,
i
agree.
but
it
seemed
to
be
accepted.
so
has
something
changed
or
were
they
all
wrong
or
what's
the
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
think
that
hand
or
american
jurisprudence
or
the
cases
or
roscoe
conkling
or
the
civil
or
any
of
these
things
said
one
thing
one
way
or
the
other
about
whether
it
fell
within
the
categories.
i'm
not
sure
i'm
right
on
that,
which
is
why
i'm
raising
it.
and...
and
if
i...
if
i...
but
if
i
am
right,
can
you
use
the
second
category,
anything
that
aggravates
a
crime?
it
seems
to
aggravate
a
crime
to
say
that
this
crime
would
have
been
prosecuted
for
3
years
and
then
we
change
it
retroactively
and
say
it
could
be
prosecuted
for
50
years.
i
mean,
that
seems
to
aggravate
the...
so
what
is
your
response
to
those--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--am
i
right
in
thinking
they
were
silent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
two...
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
suppose
on
that
particular
point,
the
state
had
a
law
that
said
that
oral
evidence
can
no
longer
be
used
for
conviction
after
10
years
passes.
and
then
it
later
changed
the
law
to
say
it
can
be.
would
that
fall
under
the
fourth
category?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
just...
what
you'd
say
is
you'd
say
no
oral
evidence
of
child
abuse
can
be
admitted
after
10
years,
though
you
can
use
other
forms
of
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
according
to
the
state
of
california
the
marion
stogner
who
is
the
petitioner
committed
acts
of
sex-related
child
abuse
between
the
years
1955
and
1973.
by
1976,
the
three
years
after
the
last
act,
all
the
relevant
statutes
of
limitation
had
expired.
so,
at
that
point
the
law
forbid
any
prosecution.
about
20
years
later,
in
1993
and
1996,
they
are
two
different
statutes,
california
enacted
new
laws
which
in
effect
extended
limitations
periods
almost
indefinitely,
and
they
also
permitted
a
retroactive
revival
of
a
prosecution,
one
that
would
have
originally
been
barred.
california
then
applied
this
new
law
to
stogner
and
in
1998,
it
brought
a
prosecution
against
him
based
upon
the
acts
which
he
had
allegedly
committed
between
43
and
25
years
earlier.
now,
stogner
has
argued
that
the
constitution's
ex
post
facto
clause
bars
california's
effort
retroactively
to
revive
this
long
dead
prosecution.
we
conclude
that
stogner
is
right
and
we
hold
that
the
statute
is
applied
to
his
prosecution
is
unconstitutional.
our
conclusion
rests
upon
three
sets
of
considerations:
first,
we
think
that
the
statute
threatens
the
kinds
of
harm
that
the
ex
post
facto
clauses
seek
to
avoid.
judge
learned
at
hand
once
wrote
that
extending
a
limitations
period
after
the
state
has
"ensured"
a
man
that
he
has
become
safe
from
its
pursuit
seems
to
most
of
us
unfair
and
dishonest.
the
government
has
refused
"to
play"
by
its
own
rule.
it
has
deprived
the
defendent
of
that
fair
warning
that
might
have
led
him
to
preserve
evidence.
in
the
words
of
calder
versus
bull,
a
very
old
but
still
a
leading
supreme
court
case
in
the
ex
post
facto
area,
the
law
before
us
is
"manifestly
unjust
and
oppressive".
the
second
set
of
considerations
is
that
statute
falls
literally
within
the
terms
of
one
of
two
descriptions
of
ex
post
facto
laws
that
justice
chase
provided
nearly
200
years
ago
in
calder
versus
bull.
this
description
refers
to
instances
in
which
the
british
parliament
"inflicted
punishments
where
the
party
was
not
by
law
liable
to
any
punishment",
and
we
think
that
is
what
california's
law
does.
after
the
expiration
of
the
statute,
he
was
not
liable
by
law
to
any
punishment
and
california
then
passed
a
law
which
inflicted
a
punishment.
we
recognized
that
justice
chase
also
described
this
category
of
ex
post
facto
laws
in
a
different
way
with
the
words
"law
that
aggravates
a
crime
or
makes
it
greater
than
it
was
when
committed",
but
we
find
no
inconsistency
here
for
one
can
easily
read
the
phrase
law
making
a
crime
greater
than
it
was
when
committed
as
including
a
law
that
inflicts
punishment
where
when
the
law
is
passed
the
party
is
not
liable
to
punishment.
and
as
so
read
the
former
words
cover
the
case
as
well.
third,
legislators,
courts
and
commentators
all
have
believed
for
more
than
a
century
that
a
law
that
like
the
present
law
revives
a
forbidden
prosecution
is
an
ex
post
facto
law.
with
virtual
unanimity,
american
courts
have
said
this
and
when
necessary
they
have
held
it.
outside
of
california,
we
have
found
no
authority
to
the
contrary.
we
discuss
these
matters
further
in
our
opinion,
we
recognize
that
we
are
talking
about
a
law,
not
a
law
that
was
extending
the
statute
of
limitations
enacted
before
the
statute
expired
here
where
one
have
a
law
that
extends
the
statute
of
limitations
enacted
after
the
earlier
stature
has
expired,
and
it
is
that
latter
case
that
we
are
considering,
and
we
hold
that
this
latter
case,
the
laws
are
unconstitutional.
we
also
have
in
the
opinion
quite
a
lengthy
discussion,
i
call
it
a
discussion
with
the
dissent
which
took
a
contrary
view
of
a
number
of
these
matters.
the
bottom
line
is
that
we
hold
california's
effor
to
prosecute
marion
stogner
unconstitutional
and
we
reverse
the
california
court's
decision
to
the
contrary.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
have
joined.
