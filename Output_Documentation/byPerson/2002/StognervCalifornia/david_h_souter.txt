justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
before
you
get
to
four?
may
i
ask
you
just
to
spend
a...
a
moment
on
something
that...
that
hasn't
been
the
focus
of
much?
and
that
is
category
two
that...
that
refers
to
ex
post
facto
as
something
that
makes
greater
or
more
serious
a...
a
crime
that
was
previously
defined.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
sort
of
indexes
of
seriousness
in
a
crime.
one
is
the...
the
penalty
in
the
strict
sense
that
is...
is
provided
for
it,
but
another
index
seems
to
me,
the
period
of
time
after
its
commission
that
a
person
who
committed
it
is
liable
to
be
prosecuted.
that
is
a
judgment
about
seriousness.
and
that
judgment
is
being
changed
here.
why
doesn't
it
offend
the
second
category?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
that
isn't
exactly
the
term
that
at
least
that...
that
calder
used.
i
mean,
it...
it...
calder
states...
i'm...
i'm
looking
at
the
quotation
on
page...
page
6
of
the...
8,
rather,
of
the...
the
government's
brief.
it...
it
refers
to
every
law
that
aggravates
a
crime
or
makes
it
greater
than
it
was
when
committed.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
that
the
aggravation
greater
concept
isn't
necessarily
limited
to
the
index
of
punishment,
and
it...
it
could
refer
to
the...
to
the
index
of
seriousness
that...
that
exists
in
the
period
of
liability
to
prosecution.
justice
david
h.
souter
may...
may
i
ask
you
this...
this
question?
obviously,
the...
you
know,
the...
we're
engaged
in
kind
of
a
definition
of
what
the
categories
mean,
as
well
as
an
analysis
of
what
you
have.
would
you
agree
that
if
we
do
not
fit
this
case
within
one
of
the
calder
categories,
that...
and...
and
we
accept
your
position,
that
we
will
have
to
overrule
hale
and...
and
henkel,
the...
the
case
holding
that...
that
in
fact,
the...
the
fifth
amendment
cannot
be
pleaded
once
the...
once
the
statute
has
expired?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
in
other
words,
the...
one
could
be
required
to
present
evidence
against
himself
and
then
the
next
morning
the
state
could
say,
hey,
we've
had
a
great
idea.
we're
going
to
extend
the
statute
of
eliminations...
the
statute
of
limitations
and
prosecute
you
for
what
you
just
admitted
to
under
the
authority
of
hale
and
henkel.
is...
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
would...
would
that...
and
i...
and
i
think
this
is
your
position.
that
would
equally
be
true
if
the
statute
is
extended
before
it
has
expired.
justice
david
h.
souter
--let's...
let's
assume
the
state
says
no.
then...
then
there's
no
problem
here.
