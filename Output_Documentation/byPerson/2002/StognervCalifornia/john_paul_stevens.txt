justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
go
through
the
four
categories,
might
i
just
ask
this
general
question?
what
if
the
defendant
had
been
pardoned,
would
it
be
an...
an
ex
post
facto
violation
to...
for
the
legislature
to
say
we're
going
to
now
make
it
subject
to
prosecution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry.
i
really
didn't
understand.
you
say
that
the
pardon
would
be
treated
differently
than
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
it
would
be
treated
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
about
a
general
amnesty
for,
say,
illegal
aliens
coming
into
the
country
and
then
congress
passes
a
statute
saying
we
will
forgive
the
crime
and
you
cannot
be
prosecuted?
the
same
analysis
there
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
would
those
issues
be
different
in
that
situation
than
in
this
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
unconditional
in
my
hypothesis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
like
a
pardon
but
a
legislative
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
can't
we
look
to
due
process
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gornstein,
may
i
interrupt
you
to
ask
the
same
question
i
did
of
your
co-counsel?
do
you
agree
that
the
rule
in
this
case
will
apply
to
pardons
and
general
amnesties
as
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
other
clause
might
apply
other
than--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what...
what
provision
of
the
constitution
prevents
the
legislature
from
authorizing
the...
the
prosecution
of
someone
who
has
been
pardoned?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
what's
the
difference
with
an
amnesty
too?
legislative
amnesty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
word
final
appear
in
the
pardon
clause?
does
the
word
final--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you...
you
assert
there
would
be
no
ex
post
facto
violation,
but
why
is
it
different
from
the...
from
a
statute
of
limitations
running?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
you
could...
you
could
indict
someone
after
granting
them
amnesty.
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
one
question.
other
than
the
reference
to
the
language
in
the
four
categories,
is
there
any
precedent
of
this
court
supporting
the
government's
position?
