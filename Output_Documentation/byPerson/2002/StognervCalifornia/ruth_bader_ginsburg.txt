but
you're
saying
a
state
could
have
no
statutes
of
limitations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
have
no
trouble
with
prospective
application
of
either
saying
we're
not
going
to
have
any
statute
of
limitations
for
this
crime
or
prospectively
the
time
is
going
to
be
longer.
you're
only
talking
about
the
retrospective.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
for
the...
the...
you
were
being
asked
before
about
the
difference
between
extending
a
limitation
that
has
not
yet
expired
and
reviving
a
dead
case,
and
for
that
there's...
there
was
a
very
nice
statement
of
the
difference
between
the
two
by
judge
learned
hand.
i
thought
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
you
would
come
back
with
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
whatever
the
federal
stopper,
i...
i
gather
that
this
court
must
have
assumed
there's
such
a
distinction
when
it
was
dealing
with
fifth
amendment
claims
and
it
said,
once
the
statute
of
limitations
has
expired,
you
can't
plead
the
fifth.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
would
be
the
same
for
the
pardon
and
the
amnesty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
another
preliminary
question.
you
started
out
by
saying
these
are
very
troublesome
kinds
of
cases.
but
the
argument
that
you're
making,
i
take
it,
is
across
the
board.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
doesn't...
it
could
be...
it
could
be
pickpocketing
and...
and
the
argument
would
be
the
same.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
calder
category
in...
in
carmell,
the
opinion
of
the
court
said
that
category
covers
instances
where
the
government
refuses
after
the
fact
to
play
by
its
own
rules,
altering
them
in
a
way
that
is
advantageous
only
to
the
state
to
facilitate
an
easier
conviction.
if
that
was
the
court's
most
recent
description
of
the
fourth
category,
this
case
would
seem
to
fit
in
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
your
position
on...
on
hale
against
henkel
and
brown
against
walker?
the
fifth
amendment.
can...
can
the
state
say
the
statute
of
limitations
has
expired,
therefore
you
have
to
speak,
and
then
revive
the
time
in
which
the
prosecution
can
be
brought?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
odd,
mr.
gornstein,
isn't
it,
that
we
take
as
gospel
something
that
was
said
en
passant
in...
what
year
was
calder
against
bull?
very
early
on.
and
the
case
in
fact
decided
it
wasn't
an
ex
post
facto
law.
so
this
was
dictum
en
passant,
and
it
didn't
dispose
of
the
case
one
way
or
another.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--which
collins
also
said
something...
the
recitation
in
collins
included,
nor
deprive
one
charged
of...
with
crime
of
any
defense.
it
used
the
word
any
defense
available
according
to
the
law
at
the
time
the
act
was
committed.
