mr.
roberto
najera
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
comes
before
the
court
asking
one
thing
and
one
thing
only,
that
the
state
of
california
be
bound
by
its
decrees
and
its
laws
that
have
guided
it
throughout
the
history
of
california,
that
the
state
and
the
federal
government
be
bound
by
the
laws
of
the
land
that
have
been
in
place
essentially
since
the
state's
foundation.
since
early
on
in
this
country's
history,
chief
justice
marshall
looked
at
a
matter
similar
and
said
it
would
be
repugnant
to
the
genius
of
our
laws
to
allow
the
prosecution
to
continue
after
the
statute
of
limitations
had
expired.
such
has
been
the
law
that
only
a
few
times
in
the
history
of
this
nation
has
any
state
had
the
trepidation
to
attempt
to
revive
an
expired
cause
of
action
in
a
criminal
matter.
in
each
such
instance,
the
states
have
been...
the
state
has
not
been
permitted
to
do
so.
in
each
such
instance,
such
as
in
state
v.
sneed,
moore
v.
state,
and
other
such
cases--
mr.
roberto
najera
--they
were,
your
honor.
and...
however,
as
i
said,
in
adams
v.
wood,
it
involved
a
federal
matter
and
it
involved
a
matter
that
we
might
consider
equally
repugnant.
it
had
to
do
with
the
prosecution
of
an
individual
who
was
involved
in
the
slave
trade
and
laws
that
prohibited
that.
however,
the
attempt
to
punish
that
occurred
after
the
statute
had
run,
and
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
indicated
in
that
particular
case
that
even
if
the
case
had
been
treason,
it
could
not
be
prosecuted,
for
under
the
federal
law,
treason
was
only
prosecutable
for
a
3-year
period.
mr.
roberto
najera
no,
your
honor.
he
based
it
on
the
law
that
the
statute
of
limitations
in
that
case,
the
federal
law
had
in
fact
called
for
an
expiration
of
the
cause
of
action,
and
the
court
there
decided
that,
no,
it
could
not
be
prosecuted.
but
no,
he
did
not
decide
it
on
the
ex
post
facto
basis,
your
honor.
as
the
court
knows,
we
raise
two
issues
here,
the
ex
post
facto
clause
and
the
due
process
clause,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
two
clauses,
while
they
both
deal
with
arbitrariness
and
unfairness,
are
not
coextensive
and
that
similarly,
in
addressing
the
matter,
neither
is
petitioner's
claim
as
to
each,
for
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
we
are
not
looking
as
to
whether
rights
have
vested.
such
is
not
a
concern
of
the
court
for
ex
post
facto
concerns.
however,
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
stogner
has
been
vested
with
a
right.
the
state
of
california
has
given
him
a
substantive
right,
a
defense
that
is
neither
waivable
nor
forfeitable.
mr.
roberto
najera
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
however,
as
i
indicated,
the
two
claims
are...
are
not
necessarily
coextensive,
and
i
would
like
to
point
the
court
out
to
the
case
of
sacramento
v.
lewis.
there,
the
court
may
recall,
involved
a
high-speed
chase.
the
police
were
after
individuals
on
a
motorcycle.
the
motorcycle
crashed.
there
was
in
that
case
no
fourth
amendment
claim
because
no
seizure
had
occurred
of
the
person
prior
to
the
crash
taking
place.
the
court,
nevertheless,
was
able
to
analyze
that
case
under
the
substantive
due
process
principles
because
it
fell
outside
of
the
fourth
amendment.
here
we
clearly
believe
that
the
case
falls
well
within
the...
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
however,
should
the
court
decide
otherwise,
it
strikes
me
that
it
should
not
render
this
court
impotent
to
examine
the
matter
as
a
substantive
due
process.
it
seems--
mr.
roberto
najera
--well--
mr.
roberto
najera
--well,
justice
scalia,
as
i've
indicated,
the
causes
are
not...
are
not
absolutely
coextensive.
we
have
in
this
case
a
vested
right.
the
state
of
california
has
guaranteed
to
the
petitioner
the
right
that
he
be
free
from
prosecution,
the
right
that
he
be
free
from
conviction,
and
the
right
that
he
be
free
from
punishment.
this
is
vested
to
him
under
state
law.
as
such,
that
can
be
analyzed,
whether
or
not
the
court
deems
it
sufficient,
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
as
the
court
said
in
weaver,
we
are
not
concerned
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause
with
vested
rights.
that's
not
necessary
for
analysis
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
it
is
an
additional
factor
that
the
court
certainly
should
and,
we
urge,
must
consider
under
the
due
process
clause.
if
i
may
continue,
analyzing
the
matter
first
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
i
think
the
first
question
perhaps
that
should
be
addressed
is
whether
or
not
this
is
a
rule
of
evidence
and
whether
or
not
it
falls
within
calder
four.
clearly
this
is
a
rule
of
evidence
as
the
state
of
california
has
defined
it.
it
is
a
rule
of
evidence
because
it
is
required
of
any
finder
of
fact,
whether
it
be
a
judge
sitting
pretrial
examining
the
matter
as
a
demurrer
or
in
analyzing
the
matter
as
sufficiency
of
evidence
under
penal
code
995.
mr.
roberto
najera
yes.
i...
i
would
beg
to
differ,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is,
is
california
has
injected
the
statute
of
limitations
into
every
offense
in
which
it
applies.
in
such
cases
it
becomes
a
material
ingredient
of
the
offense,
and
in
such
cases
the
prosecution
is
barred
if
that
material
ingredient
is
not
proven
by
the
prosecution.
and
if
the
matter
should
proceed
to
trial,
a
jury
must
acquit
if
the
prosecution
is
not
able
to
overcome
its
burden
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
roberto
najera
it
does,
your
honor,
in
this
respect.
if
the
evidence
comes
before
a
jury,
for
example,
and
the
evidence
shows
that
the
prosecution
is
barred,
that
no
public
offense
is
stated,
the
jury
must
acquit.
it
is
a
rule
that
guides
the
jurors,
as
much
as
it
would
guide
a
court,
in
deciding
what
must
be
done
with
the
particular
facts.
if
the
facts
before
the
court
show
that
the
case
is
barred,
then
the
prosecution
cannot
continue.
the
jurors
must
acquit.
it...
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
most
clear
rules
of
evidence
and
applicable
throughout,
not
just
to
california
and
not
just
to
the
federal
government--
mr.
roberto
najera
--i
believe
not,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
i
believe
not
is
that
what
is
promised
by
the
statute
of
limitations
is
not
any
particular
number
of
years.
rather,
what
is
promised--
mr.
roberto
najera
--because
the
evidence
that
must
be
shown
by
the
prosecution
is
that
the
case
has
not
been
barred.
that
does
not
depend
on
any
particular
number
of
years.
it
depends--
mr.
roberto
najera
--the
case
is
barred
only
when
the
statute
has
run.
one
can
liken
it
to
a
conditional
promise.
mr.
roberto
najera
because
the
evidence
of...
of
an
extended
statute
of
limitations
doesn't
go
to
whether
or
not
the
case
is
barred.
the
evidence
is
still
the
same.
the
case
has
not
yet
run.
mr.
roberto
najera
i
am
right
on
my
theory
because
the...
the
state
is
in
fact
barred
from
proceeding,
and
the
evidence
that
would
come
before
the--
mr.
roberto
najera
--i
believe
if
there
is--
mr.
roberto
najera
--i
believe
if
the
state
has
reserved
the
right
to
extend
a
statute
of
limitations
before
the
statute
has
expired,
then
there
is
no
ex
post
facto
problem.
i
believe
that
the
problem
occurs--
mr.
roberto
najera
--well,
it's
not
the
end
of
this
particular
case
because
the
statute
has,
in
fact,
run.
certainly
a
state
is
permitted
to
set
statute
of
limitations,
decide
the
terms
and
conditions
thereof,
and
go
forward
in
the
future
under
such
a
premise.
in
this--
mr.
roberto
najera
--no,
i
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
roberto
najera
because
the
ex
post
facto
clause
violation
only
occurs
when
the
offense
is
deemed
no
more,
and
that
only
occurs
when
it
runs.
so
if
the
case
hasn't
run
yet...
or
the
statute
has
not
run
yet,
we
are
in
a
completely
different
posture.
no...
in
california--
mr.
roberto
najera
--it's
okay
in
the
statute
of
limitations
context
because
there
they
have
reserved
that
situation
that
allows
them
to
say
the
public
offense
still
continues
in
this
particular
situation.
what
we
have
here
is
an
absolute
rule
that
says
once
run,
not
only
can
no
punishment
be
had,
not
only
can
no
conviction
be
had,
but
not
even
a
prosecution
can
be
maintained.
there
is
no
offense
once
the
statute
has
run.
mr.
roberto
najera
yes,
and...
and
the
states
have
clearly
done
that
in
certain
instances
such
as
in
the
case
of
murder.
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
in...
in
such
a
particular
case.
mr.
roberto
najera
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
in
its
retrospective
aspect
that
we
run
into
problems
because
the
state
has
clearly
said
there
is
no
offense
anymore.
it
is
gone.
it
is
dead.
it
has
been
terminated.
mr.
roberto
najera
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
clear
as...
as
his
honor
judge
learned
hand,
that
we're
not
offended
in
the
same
manner
before
the
crime
has
expired
when
we
extend
the
matter--
mr.
roberto
najera
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roberto
najera
various
circuit
courts
have...
as
i
recall,
have
spoken
of
it.
some
have
objected
to
such
language
recently
such
as
the...
the
brechtel
case.
but
every
state
court
that
has
looked
at
the
matter,
not
just
in
california,
has
said
you
cannot
maintain
such
an
action
once
it
has
expired.
that's
clearly
been
the
law
throughout.
and
it...
it
is
important
to
note
that
this
type
of
precedent,
this
history
has
been
throughout
the...
the
history
of
the
united
states.
we
have
cases
extending
early
on,
state
v.
sneed,
a
case
that
was
cited,
i
might
note,
in
the
kring
opinion
that
was
overruled
by
this
court.
but
nevertheless,
it
was
cited
there
for
the
proposition
that...
that
a
statute
of
limitations,
once
run,
did
in
fact
cause
ex
post
facto
violations.
mr.
roberto
najera
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
and
state
opinions
are,
of
course,
in
accord.
and
it
is
striking
to
note
that
as
late
as
1993
in
a
case
in
california
called
blackburn,
an
accused
in
a
civil
matter
attempted
to
rely
on
the
fifth
amendment
in
order
to
avoid
questions
concerning
child
molestation.
and
the
court
there
said,
well,
you
haven't
made
a
sufficient
showing,
and
the
reason
being?
because
the
statute
of
limitations
essentially
replaces
the
fifth
amendment.
and
i
would
note
in
that
regard,
in
california
in
particular,
that
the
statute
of
limitations
has
been
viewed
as
such
a
powerful
matter
that
it's
been
likened
not
only
to
the
fifth
amendment,
but
it
has
been
likened
to
the
fourth
amendment
in
that
it
prevents
unlawful
seizures
of
a
person.
it
has
been
likened
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
that
one
cannot
prosecute
a
person
again
once
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run.
and
so
this
statute
of
limitations
is
not
a
matter
of
minimal
import.
mr.
roberto
najera
it...
it
had--
mr.
roberto
najera
--to
some
extent,
yes,
and
to
some
extent,
no,
because
in
ex
post
facto
analysis,
it
is
this
court
that
looks
at
state
law
and
it's
this
court
that
makes
a
determination
whether
or
not
it
violates
ex
post
facto
regardless
of
what
label
a
state
may
give
it
in
particular.
that
principle
was
announced
in...
in
lindsey,
and
it
certainly
was
reaffirmed
in...
in
carmell.
mr.
roberto
najera
well,
the
court
looks
at...
at
the
substance
of
the
matter
i
believe.
the
court
looks
at
whether
or
not
the
law
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
simply
changing
labels
would
be
an
easy
way
for
a
state
to
get
around
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
as
the
court
said,
as
early
as
cummings,
it's
a
matter
of
substance,
not
a
matter
of
form.
and
california,
throughout
its
history,
up
until
frazer
granted,
had
always
considered
statute
of
limitations
to
be
matters
of
substance.
they
were
not
simply
remedial
matters
or
not
simply
procedural
matters.
they
were
matters
of
substance
and
they
were
matters
of
rights
for
the
defendant
or
the
person
accused.
mr.
roberto
najera
whether...
your
honor,
whether
comfortable
or
not,
i
believe
it
fits,
and
i
believe
that
it
fits
within
each
of
the
four
categories,
not
only
because
of
the
nature
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
but
because
of
the
multifaceted
nature
of
the
statute
of
limitations
at
issue
here.
for
example,
if
we
look
at
calder
category
three,
which
deals
with
punishments
and
the
laws
that
are
annexed
to
the
punishment,
in
the
case
of
lynce,
which
i
believe
was
authored
by
your
honor,
in
that
case
what
was
at
stake
was
not
what
the
state
had
defined
as
the
punishment
per
se,
the
number
of
years.
what
was
at
stake
there
was
that
the
state
itself
had
granted
credits,
overcrowding
credits.
they
did
not
even
intend
to...
to
give
a
benefit
to
the
defendant
there.
and
yet
it
fell
within
calder
three
because
the
punishment
had
been
reduced
by
laws
that
were
annexed
to
the
crime,
the
laws
dealing
with
the
overcrowding.
and
in
that
way,
one
can
say
if
the
court
rejects
the
principle
that
this
is
a
material
ingredient
of
the
offense
itself,
as
california
has
defined
it,
certainly
as
a
matter
of
punishment,
it
is
a
law
that's
annexed
to
that
punishment
and
says,
after
a
certain
period
of
time,
no
punishment
shall
be
had.
and
that's
quite
clear
under
california
law
because
it
is
not
a
waivable
right.
in
other
words,
a
person
can
go
ahead
and
proceed
to
trial
or
go
ahead
and
plead
guilty
and
be
languishing
in
prison
and
suffering
the
punishment
and
years
later
discover
that
he
has
a
statute
of
limitation
right
and
assert
it
then
and
punishment
shall
be
had
no
more.
he
must
be
released.
and
so
in
that
way
i
do
believe
it
fits
within
calder
category--
mr.
roberto
najera
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that...
that
has
been
held
over
and
over
in
california
since
its
early
days
and
reaffirmed
in
particular
in
the
mcgee
case
which
was
seminal
in
california
and
which
defined
it
not
just
merely
as
a
matter
of
defense,
not
just
merely
as
a...
as
a
right
of
the
defendant,
but
also
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction
for
the
court.
and
in
that
case,
they
made
it
very
clear
that
since
no
offense
could
be
stated,
no
jurisdiction
could
be
had
by
the
court.
mr.
roberto
najera
well,
the
frazer
case
certainly
tried
to
redefine
the
history,
i
believe,
of...
of
the
california
law.
and
i
might
note,
of
course,
that
it
dealt
with
a
subsequent
statute
of
limitations
enacted
well
after
the
statute
of
limitations
applicable
to
petitioner
in
this
case
and
reinforced
by
805.5
in
1985.
mr.
roberto
najera
it
certainly
overruled
cases
such
as
sobiek
which
had
held
that,
in
fact,
this
was
a
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
while
calling
it
a
matter
of
legislative
grace,
they
did
not
touch
cases
such
as
zamora
which
occurred
in
1976,
the
same
year
that
the
statute
of
limitations
would
have
expired
here,
that
reaffirmed
that
this
was
in
fact
a
substantive
right.
and
i
might
note
that
even
while
using
the
language
legislative
grace,
this
court
in
weaver
said
even
if
good-time
credits
are
given
as
a
matter
of
legislative
grace,
it
does
not
bar
application
of
ex
post
facto,
and
so
such
credits
cannot
be
taken
away,
even
though
they
had
not,
in
that
particular
case,
been
earned.
mr.
roberto
najera
well,
there's
certainly
an
argument
that
can
be
made,
and...
and
i
know
that
amicus
has...
has
in
a
footnote
addressed
that.
my...
my
belief
is
that
what
must
be
shown
is
not
a
particular
number
of
years
per
se,
because
that
can
be
altered
i
believe.
what
must
be
shown
by
the
evidence
before
the...
before
a
court
is
that
because
the
number
of
years
requisite
of
the
statute
of
limitation
has
in
fact
passed,
therefore
the
case
is
no
more.
so,
yes,
one
does
consider
the
number
of
years,
but
the
number
of
years
only
matter
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statute
has,
in
fact,
run
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
roberto
najera
that
is
correct.
the
state
of
california
throughout
has
told
all
of
its
citizens
you
no
longer
need
to
keep
your
guard
up
because
the
statute
has
run.
if
you
have
evidence,
you
don't
have
to
preserve
it.
if
you
have
letters
that
might
be
of
some
support
in
your
case,
you
don't
have
to
maintain
them.
if
you
have
witnesses,
you
no
longer
need
to
know
where
they
are
or...
or
how
to
get
a
hold
of
them.
and
that
only--
mr.
roberto
najera
--yes,
and
in
particular
in
california
because
in
the
same
year
that
the
sobiek
case
was
decided,
in
which
the
court
said
it
is
a
violation
of
ex
post
facto
to
revive
an
expired
cause
of
action,
in
that
same
year
they
decided
people
v.
snipe,
which
was
an
extension
case.
the
statute
had
not
yet
run,
and
the
court
there
had
no
problem
saying
there
is
no
ex
post
facto
problem
there.
if...
if
i
might
continue,
and
i
would
like
to
attempt
to
address
all...
all
the
relevant
categories.
turning
to
category
number
two,
for
example,
there
we
deal
with
a
situation
in
which
a
crime
is
aggravated
or
enlarged
and
the
opposition
says,
well,
this
only
deals
with
punishment.
well,
in
one
respect
all
calder
categories
deal
with...
ultimately
with
punishment.
nevertheless,
it
is
a
situation
that
is
simply
not
redundant
to
the
other
categories.
it
is
a
category
unto
itself.
and...
and
even
though
there
does
not
appear
to
be
a
great
deal
of
case
law
on
the
point,
one
must
still
ask
the
question,
when
is
a...
when
is
a
case
aggravated
in
a
fashion
that
doesn't
merely
mirror
one
of
the
other
calder
categories,
and
i
believe
it's
when
the
jurisdiction
is
increased,
when
persons
who
fall
outside
of
the
statute
become
ensnared
in
it.
and
if
i
might,
unless
there
is
an
additional
question,
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time.
mr.
roberto
najera
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to,
first
of
all,
answer
one
question.
it's
clear
by
california
law
that
post-conviction,
a
person
can
raise,
either
by
habeas
or
other
appellate
relief,
the
statute
of
limitations
claim.
that's
been
clear
since
ex
parte
vice
and
was
reaffirmed
in
the
mcgee
case.
turning
to
the
collins
question,
the
real
import
in
collins
was
not
to
get
caught
up
in
distinctions
or
labels
such
as
substantive
versus
procedure,
and
it
would
seem
that
if
we
began
to
draw
such
distinctions
here,
we
run
ultimately
into
the
same
problems.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
collins
stands
for
the
proposition
that
affirmative
defenses,
defenses
which
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
establishing,
are
protected,
why
are
not
defenses
that
the
district
attorney
must
disprove
such
as
the
statute
of
limitations?
for
this
has
always
been,
in
california,
the
burden
upon
the
prosecution
to
show
that
the
statute
has
in
fact
not
run.
also,
it
seems
that
the
state
wishes
to
shift
the
burden
and
foist
it
upon
the
petitioner
and
says,
well,
we
can
address
this
in
procedural
due
process,
while
in
fact
that,
as
i
said,
foists
the
burden
onto
the
petitioner
when
the
burden
in
fact
lies
with
the
prosecution.
and
in
the
marion
case,
supreme
court
case,
the
court
reaffirmed
that
an
irrebuttable
presumption
of
harm
occurs
by
such
delay,
and
that's
by
way
of
the
legislative
act.
finally,
i'd
like
to
note
that
not
only
would
finality
be
upset
in
these
particular
cases,
but
really
what
we're
talking
about
is
respect
for
the
laws.
every
day
in
this
country
citizens
make
bargains
with...
with
the
state,
and
the
state
makes
bargains
with
its
citizens.
it
did
so
by
creating
a
statute
of
limitations.
and
every
day,
particularly
in
the
criminal
field,
most,
the
vast
majority
of
the
accused
enter
into
bargains.
they
plea
bargain.
they
give
away
their
rights
and
accept
a
bargain.
and
we
hold
them
to
that.
we
hold
them
accountable
for
what
they
bargain.
are
we
here...
if
we
accept
the
state's
position,
are
we
here
to
hold
the
state
to
a
lesser
standard
than
we
hold
to
what
many
consider
the
meanest
and
lowest
amongst
us?
i
would
think
not.
i
think
we
would
expect
the
state
and
the
federal
government
to
stand
for
something
more,
to
be
the
leader
and
not
the
follower,
to
have
a
standard
higher
or
at
least
equal
to
that
of
which
we
expect
of
each
of
our
accused,
each
person
who
pleads
in
this
particular
case.
i
would
ask,
as
i
said
in
the
beginning,
that
this
court
hold
the
state
to
the
bargain
that
it
chose
to
make,
to
the
terms
that
it
chose
to
define
by
creating
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
submit
the
matter.
