mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
california's
statute
of
limitations
does
not
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause
because
it
does
not
violate
any
of
the
four
calder
categories.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
insofar
as
we're
talking
about
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
correct,
yes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
the...
the
legislature
could
not
undo
a...
an
executive
pardon--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--under
this
court's
decisions.
under
the
pardon
clause,
it
has
finality
that
the
legislature
can't
undo
it.
i
think
the
case
is
ex
parte
garland.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
provision
of
the
constitution
that
grants
the
president
the
power
to
pardon.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
can
i...
let
me...
let
me
do
the
pardon
first.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
then
i'll
move
to
the
amnesty.
with
respect
to
a
presidential
pardon,
it
is
final
with
respect
to
the
legislature
by
virtue
of
the
pardon
clause.
the
pardon
clause
gives
the
president
the
power
to
issue
a
final
pardon
that
the...
the
legislature
can't
undo.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
is
not,
but
that's
how
the
court
interpreted
the
pardon
clause
in,
i
think
it's
ex
parte
garland,
but
i'm
not
sure
of
the
decision.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
there
would
be
a
state
constitutional
provision
usually
analogous
to
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
there
would
not
be
a
federal--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--if
the
state...
if
the
state
says
no,
then
the
only
question
that
would
arise
in
a
pardon
is
if
you
start
to
analogize
it
to
a
agreement
situation
like
santobello
because
in
some
pardon
situations,
it's
like
an
offer
and
it
has
to
be
accepted.
you
can't
just
force
a
pardon
on
somebody.
and
if
there's
an
offer
and
an
acceptance,
you
could
potentially
analogize
it
under
the
due
process
principle
of
santobello
where
the
government
can't
withdraw
from
an
agreement
without
implicating
the
due
process
clause.
with
respect
to
an
amnesty,
there
would
not
be,
again,
an
ex
post
facto
clause
violation,
and
there
would
not
be
a...
any
other
sort
of
due
process
violation,
again,
once
again,
unless
it
fell
into
the
santobello
kind
of
situation
or
the
raley
kind
of
situation
where
the
government
offers
something,
it's
accepted,
and
then
it--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--there's
no...
there's
no
ex
post
facto
clause
violation
with
a
statute
of
limitations
running
either.
that's
our
position
because
it
does
not
violate--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--yes,
yes.
now,
with--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
premise
of
that
decision
is
that
you
cannot
assert
the
fifth
amendment
when
there's
no
present
threat
of
prosecution,
and
there
is
no
present
threat
of
prosecution
when
there's
an
expired
limitations
period.
but
if
the
person
speaks
under
compulsion
in
that
situation,
and
a
statute
of
limitations
is
subsequently
retroactively
amended,
the
government
could
not
use
the
testimony
that
was
secured
through
compulsion.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the...
in
this
court's
decision
in
collins,
it
recognized
there
had
been
some
disagreement
about
the
scope
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
in
prior
cases,
and
with
some
courts
saying
that
it
goes
beyond
the
four
categories
to
capture
laws
that
operate
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
defendant
in
some
important
way
and
with
other
courts
saying
it's
limited
to
the
calder
categories.
in
collins,
the
court
resolved
that
debate
and
said
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
limited
to
the
four
calder
categories.
there
is
not
a
fifth
category
of
things
that
operate
unfairly
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
defendant.
now,
that
was
the
analysis
that
judge
hand
used
in
the
opinion
that
you
refer
to.
he
did
not
say
that
this
violates
any
of
the
four
categories.
he
essentially
said
this
operates
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
defendant
in
an
unfair
way,
a
line
of
analysis
that
this
court
ruled
out
in
collins
and
reaffirmed
ruling
it
out
in
carmell.
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
state
court
decision
that
judge
hand
referred
to
in
the
first
in
the
line
of
those
decisions,
hart
v.
moore.
it
frankly
acknowledged
that
this
law,
changing
an
expired
limitations
period,
does
not
violate
any
of
the
four
calder
categories.
it
said,
though,
we
are
going
to
go
with
the
spirit
that
underlies
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
well,
again,
this
court's
decision
in
collins
absolutely
rules
out
that
line
of
analysis.
in
order
to
find
an
ex
post
facto
clause
violation,
you
must
find
that
it
violates
one
of
the
specific
calder
categories.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
on
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
in
hart
v.
moore,
which
is
the
key
precedent
that
judge
hand
referred
to,
it's
just
an
1880
case,
the...
the
court
said
that
it
doesn't
violate
the
four
calder
categories.
and
so
it...
it
relied
on
the
spirit
underlying
the
clause.
in
the
case
of
judge
hand,
he
didn't
undertake
an
analysis
under
the
four
categories,
but
he
undertook
the
kind
of
a
catchall
fifth
category
analysis
that
some
of
this
court's
cases
suggested
was
possible
at
the
time,
but
that
the
collins
case
said
is
not.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
category
two,
category
two,
this
court
explained
in
the
carmell
decision,
is
traced
to
wooddeson's
discussion.
wooddeson
said
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
laws
that
affect
punishment.
one
of
them
creates
new
punishments,
another
one
increases
the
severity
of
the
punishment.
and
what
the
court
said
in
carmell
is
that
justice
chase
precisely
adapted
those
concepts
into
his
category.
category
two
is
changing...
creating
a
punishment.
category
three
is
increasing
the
severity
of
the
punishment.
and
that
is
the
limit
of
what
those
two
categories
involve,
and
neither
of
those
are
implicated
in
this
case
because
the
punishment
is
exactly
the
same
in
form
and
amount
as
that
which
was
prescribed
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but...
but
the
situation
is
not
that
the...
it
is
stare
decisis
from
that
case.
it
is
stare
decisis
from
subsequent
cases
like
collins
and
others
which
have
concluded
that
justice
chase
accurately
determined
the
limits
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
based
on
the
historical
evidence
of
what
the
framers
thought,
including
wooddeson
and
blackstone
and...
and
state
constitutions,
and
the
framers
and
other
sources
that
he
relied
on.
he
was
right.
he
got
it
right,
and
subsequent
decisions
of
the
court
have
held
that,
including
collins.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no.
in...
in
collins,
what
the
court
said
is
that...
that
prior
cases
had
used
that
formulation
of
any
defense
and
in
particular
beazell.
and
what
collins
did
was
to
clarify
that
the
only
defenses
that
are
available
are
those
that
go
to
excuse
or
justification
at
the
time
the
offense
is
committed.
and
it
merges
it
then
with
the
first
category
which
deals
with
changing
laws
and
criminalizing
conduct
that
was
innocent
when
done.
the
defenses
that...
that
are
prohibited
that
you
can't
change
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause
are
those
that
have
the
effect
of
criminalizing
conduct
that
would
have
been
innocent
when
it
was
done.
i
want
to
move
to
the
fourth
category
where
some
of
the
questions
have
been,
and
it's
critical
to
understand
the
fourth
category
is
closely
connected
to
the
first
category.
it...
it
changes
what
evidence
is
sufficient
to
show
that
the
defendant's
conduct
was
a
crime
at
the
time
he
acted,
and
a
statute
of
limitations
does
not
operate
in
that
way.
it
changes
what
evidence
is
sufficient
to
show
that
there
has
been
a
timely
prosecution,
but
it
has
no
effect
whatsoever
on
what
evidence
is
sufficient
to
show
that
the
defendant's
conduct
was
a
crime
at
the
time
he
acted.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it...
it
would,
justice
breyer,
if
you
said
no
evidence
is
sufficient
to
sustain
a
conviction
unless
it
meets
certain
specifications
because
that's
going
to
the
crime.
you
can't
prove
up
the
crime
that
way.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no.
admissibility
is
a
different
question,
justice
breyer.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
wouldn't
apply
to
admissibility.
under...
carmell
draw...
drew
a
distinction
between
admissibility
and
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
rules.
changes
in
admissibility
rules
are
permissible.
changes
in
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
rules
are
not.
now,
explaining
further
why
the
fourth
category
needs
to
be
read
in
this
way,
there
are
several
reasons.
the
first
is
that's
the
way
the
court
has
applied
the
fourth
category.
in
situations
where
there's
been
a
change
in
what
evidence
is
sufficient
to
prove
the
first...
to
prove
the
defendant
committed
a
crime,
it
found
a
violation,
as
in
carmell
and
as
in
cummings.
but
where
the
change
was...
there
was
a
change
in
what
was
sufficient
to
establish
some
other
precondition
that
doesn't
go
back
to
whether
the
defendant
acted
criminally
at
the
beginning,
the
court
hasn't
found
a
violation.
and...
and
the
example
is
gut
v.
minnesota
where
there
was
a
change
in
the
venue
rule.
what
was
changed
there...
change
was...
was
sufficient
to
prove
venue,
which
was
a
precondition
to
guilt,
but
it
didn't
change
what
was
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
defendant
acted
in
a
criminal
manner
when
he
acted.
and
the
court
said
that
there
was
no
fourth
category
violation.
also,
the
statutes
of
limitations
for
over
100
years...
all
the
courts
have
concluded
that
if
you
retroactively
amend
an
expired
limit...
i'm
sorry...
an
unexpired
limitations
period,
there's
no
ex
post
facto
clause
violation,
and
in
terms
of
the
calder
category
four,
there's
absolutely
no
difference
between
those
statutes
and
this
one.
in
both
cases,
it
changes
what's
sufficient
to
show
that
there
is
a
timely
prosecution.
in
neither
case
does
it
change
what's
sufficient
to
show
that
the
defendant
committed...
when
he
acted,
he
committed
a
crime.
and
that
is
what
category
four
is
about.
finally,
in
carmell,
this
court
noted
that
category
four
is
a
mirror
image
of
category
one,
and
it
said
they
both
work
together
to
prevent
subversions
of
the
presumption
of
innocence.
and
that
description
of
category
four
supports
the
conclusion
of
the
linkage
between
four
and
one
that
the...
what
you're
talking
about
are
rules
that
change
what
evidence
is
sufficient
to
show
that
the
defendant's
conduct
was
a
crime
when
he
acted.
and
that's
not...
and
the
statute
of
limitations
here
doesn't
do
that.
it
changes
what's
sufficient
to
show
that
there's
been
a
timely
prosecution.
it
doesn't
change
in
any
way
what's
sufficient
to
show
that
the
defendant
committed
a
crime
when
he
acted.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the...
the
only
precedent...
and
it's
mild
precedent...
is
the
stewart
v.
kahn
decision
where
the
court
was
examining
a
retroactive
tolling
period
during
the
civil
war,
and
the
court...
the
issue
actually
before
the
court
was
the
civil
component
of
that.
but
in
the
course
of
discussing
that,
justice
stevens,
the
court
mentioned
that
the
criminal
component
of
it
was
also
retroactive
and...
and
it
applied
to
expired
limitations
period.
and
in
a
paragraph
that
applied
to
both
civil
and
criminal,
the
court
said
there's
no
constitutional
problem
with
that.
