that...
that
would
render
the
rule
quite
pointless.
i
mean,
the
rule
is
if
it
is
analyzable
under...
under
a
very
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
and
is
not
valid
under
that
one,
you
then
don't
move
on
to
analyze
it
under
another
one.
and...
but
you're
saying
unless
you
win
under
the
narrow
one,
it's
not
over.
if
you
lose
under
the
narrow
one,
you
then
can
go
on
to
the
due
process
clause.
justice

that
doesn't
make
it
much
of
a...
much
of
a
safeguard,
it
seems
to
me.
