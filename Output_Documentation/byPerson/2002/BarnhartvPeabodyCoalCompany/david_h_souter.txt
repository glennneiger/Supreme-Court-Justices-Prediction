when

i
gather
that's
what
you're
doing.
when
do
you
actually
make
the
adjustments?
justice
david

but
is...
is
the
percentage
recalculated
as
of
the
beginning
of...
of
each
kind
of
fiscal
year
following
the...
the
initial
october

date?
or...
or
in
the
middle
of
a
company's...
in
the
middle
of
a
year
running
from
october
1,
are
they
suddenly
socked
with
a...
or
at
least
liable
to
be
socked
with
an
assignment
for
which
they
had
no
reason
to
plan
on

and
is
that

to

or
be

as

justice
david

okay.
justice
david

no,
but
if...
if
you
don't
read
the
two
provisions
together,
if
you
don't
read
the
shall
clause
and...
and
the
calculation
clause
together,
you...
you
get
a
system
which
is
simply
incoherent.
you've
got
a
system
in
which
assignments
are
being
made,
but
in
fact
the...
the
combined
fund
is
being
operated
as...
as
if
they
were
not
being
made.
and,
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
that
you...
you've
got
to
go
the
whole
hog.
you...
you've
simply
got
to
say
that
the...
the
october
1
deadline
has
got
to
be
read
together
with
the
shall
clause,
and
if
the
shall
clause
can
be
varied,
then
the
october
1
deadline
can
be
varied,
too,
because
otherwise
you
just
get
an
incoherent
system.
do
you
agree?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
you're
doing.
justice
david
h.

and
you've
given
us
step
one.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there's
a...
there's
a
retroactive
assessment?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
roberts,
all
i...
all
that,
i
guess,
is
conceded
in
the
argument,
but
the...
the...
when
all
is
said
and
done,
there
seems
to
be
an...
an
inequity
as
among
the
operators.
and
i
can
understand
your...
i
do
understand,
i
accept
your
argument
that
at
least
to
get
the
plan
going
initially,
that
the
objective
of
congress
would
have
been,
as
it
were,
a
good
system
rather
than
a
perfect
system.
what
i
don't
see
is
why
congress
would
want...
would
have
wanted
to
make
it
impossible
to
improve
on
that
system
later
by
eliminating
the...
the
inequity
of
an
erroneous
failure
to
assign.
and
it's...
it's
that
issue
that
makes
it
difficult
for
me
to
read
the...
the
shall
language
as
being,
as...
as
they
say,
jurisdictional
or
providing
a
cutoff.
can
you
address
what
the
reason
congress
would
have
had
for
wanting
to
preserve
that
inequity?
justice
david
h.
souter
how...
how
do
we
know
this,
mr.
roberts?
i...
i
take
it
there's
no
helpful
statement
in
the
legislative
history
saying,
you
know,
by
the
way,
this
is,
you
know,
the
linchpin
of
the
deal,
that
with
respect
to
unassigned
miners,
there
will
be
no
monkeying
around
after
october
1st,
'93?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but...
i
mean,
that...
that's
an
assumption
we
can't
make.
i
mean,
i
think
there
is
a
clear
understanding
that
when
someone
is
given
an
either/or
choice,
shall
may
be...
mean
one
thing.
when
one
is
given
a
timing
or
a
deadline
choice,
it
may
mean
something
else.
the
statute
is
addressing
different
issues
and
the
same
verb
may
well
have
different
meanings
in...
in
the
different
contexts.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
provided...
it
had
a
default
provision.
in
effect,
it
says,
if
there
hasn't
been
an
assignment
to
an
operator,
this
is
where
the
person
goes
for
purposes
of
this
tripartite
calculation.
but
the
fact
that
there
may
be
a
default
provision
in
the
case
of...
of
inaction,
i
don't
think
necessarily
is...
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
there
is
a
provision
for
all
time
about
what
shall
happen.
it's
just
that
their
immediate
object
was
there
had
to
be
a
grouping
of
these
miners
as
of
october
1
or
there
would
have
been
no
way
to
calculate
the...
the
sources
of
the...
the
various
assessments
to
pay
for
it.
but
that...
all
that
does
is
say,
okay,
you've
got
a
default
in
place...
default
position...
provision
in
place
so
that
you
know
what
to
do
as
of
october
1.
but
it
doesn't
answer
the...
the
question
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
she
could
have
done
that
if
she
had
done
absolutely
nothing
at
all.
if...
if
she
had
done
zero
on...
on
october
1st,
the...
the
default
provision
would
have...
would
have
come
into
play
and
there
would
have
been
a
result
of
october
1st.
and...
and
i
assume
you
would
not
take
the
position
there
that
a...
a
total
default
by
the
government
of
any
action
at
all
would...
would
be
required
to
go
unremedied
for
all
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
would
have
been
a
result
as
of
october
1st.
justice
david
h.
souter
these
cases
come
to
us
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
coal
industry
retiree
health
benefit
act
of
1992
established
a
comprehensive
scheme
for
funding
benefits
for
retired
coal
industry
employees.
the
question
here
goes
to
the
interpretation
of
the
section
of
the
coal
act
providing
that
the
commission
of
social
security
shall,
before
october
1,
1993,
assign
such
eligible
retirees
to
a
particular
coal
company
or
an
affiliate
which
will
then
be
responsible
for
funding
the
retirees
benefits.
assignment
of
beneficiaries
to
a
coal
company
has
two
relevant
consequences:
first,
each
company
must
pay
an
annual
premium
to
fund
the
health
and
death
benefits
for
its
assigned
beneficiaries
and
their
eligible
dependents;
second,
the
company
may
have
to
pay
a
further
premium
based
on
the
needs
of
retirees
who
are
not
assigned
to
particular
coal
companies.
this
so-called
unassigned
beneficiary
premium
is
calculated
based
on
the
number
of
assigned
beneficiaries
a
company
has.
the
greater
number
of
assigned
beneficiaries
to
hire
the
company's
unassigned
beneficiaries
premium.
in
these
cases,
the
commissioner
signs
several
beneficiaries
to
the
respondent
companies
after
the
coal
act's
deadline
of
october
1,
1993.
the
companies
sued
the
commissioner
in
two
separate
lawsuits
claiming
that
the
assignments
were
void
because
they
were
untimely.
the
district
courts
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
company's
in
both
cases,
thus
holding
that
an
assignment
after
october
1,
1993
was
void.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
both
judgments
based
on
circuit
precedent.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse.
although
the
statutory
date
is
clearly
a
mandatory
deadline,
the
use
of
the
word
shall
combined
with
a
date
does
not
automatically
prohibit
an
agency
from
completing
its
duty
even
in
untimely
fashion.
our
cases
have
held
since
1986,
that
the
federal
courts
will
not
impose
or
sanction
for
an
agency's
failure
to
comply
with
a
statutory
filing
timing
provision
if
congress
does
not
provide
one
and
congress
was
presumably
aware
of
these
cases
when
it
passed
the
coal
act
in
1992.
similar
uses
of
the
word
"shall"
combined
with
dates
and
other
provisions
of
the
coal
act
support
our
conclusion.
the
presence
of
a
system
for
funding
the
benefits
of
unassigned
beneficiaries
did
not
mean
that
congress
meant
to
leave
beneficiaries
who
are
not
assigned
on
time
unassigned
forever.
nothing
indicates
that
congress
ever
foresaw
other
possibility
that
beneficiaries
who
could
be
assigned,
that
is
beneficiaries
form
whom
a
responsible
coal
company
is
still
in
business
would
nonetheless
not
have
been
assigned
by
october
1,
1993.
the
companies
themselves
point
out
that
as
late
as
1995,
congress
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
work
had
been
completed
on
time.
the
provision
that
a
coal
company's
applicable
percentage
share
of
the
unassigned
beneficiaries
premium
is
determined
on
the
basis
of
assignments
as
of
october
1,
1993
was
adopted
on
the
reasonable
assumption
then
that
the
work
would
be
done
on
time.
it
did
not
state
that
if
the
work
was
not
done
on
time,
it
could
not
be
done
at
all.
the
legislative
objective
of
allocating
the
greatest
number
of
eligible
beneficiaries
to
responsible
coal
companies
is
served
by
treating
the
deadline
as
a
spur
to
prompt
action
by
the
commissioner
not
as
a
loophole
that
would
let
certain
fortunate
companies
go
scot
free.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
o'connor
and
thomas
join;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
