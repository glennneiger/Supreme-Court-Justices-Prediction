mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
seeking
a
windfall
because
the
social
security
administration
didn't
complete
its
work
on
time.
they
should
not
get
it.
it
is
conceded
in
this
case
that
the
beneficiaries
at
issue
were
supposed
to
be
assigned
to
bellaire
and
peabody.
it's
conceded
that
these
respondents
are
not
being
asked
to
pay
a
penny
more
than
congress
wanted
them
to
pay.
it's
conceded
that
congress
wanted
as
many
beneficiaries
as
possible
to
be
assigned
to
particular
operators.
section
9706(a)
itself
directs
ssa
to
assign
each
beneficiary.
now--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
respondents
make
a
great
deal
of
that
as
if
the
only
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
ensure
that
the
beneficiaries
would
continue
to
receive
their
health
coverage.
that
was
surely
a
major
percentage.
mr.
peter
buscemi
but
the
financing
method
of
the
benefits
was
also
a
key
component
of
the
statute.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
combined
fund
will--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--the
combined
fund
will
receive
funds
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
is
threefold.
it
is
complicated.
for
the
first
3
plan
years,
beginning
february
1,
1993
and
ending
october
1...
i'm
sorry...
september
30,
1995,
if
these
beneficiaries
are
not
assigned,
as
they
should
be,
to
bellaire
and
peabody,
all
of
the
other
assigned
operators
will
receive
a
greater
assessment,
and
they
will...
because
there
will
be
an
increased
number
of
unassigned
beneficiaries
during
those
first
3
plan
years.
mr.
peter
buscemi
correct.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
they...
they
surely
are
complaining.
the
apogee
case,
for
example,
in
the
eleventh
circuit
was
a
case
that
arose
precisely
because
of
that
sort
of
supplemental,
after-the-fact
assessment
designed
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
there
was
a
greater
number
of
unassigned
beneficiaries
in
the
plan.
and
that,
in
particular,
arose
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
eastern
enterprises
case.
mr.
peter
buscemi
they're...
they're
not
intervenors
in
this
case,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
buscemi
umwa
combined
benefit
fund?
mr.
peter
buscemi
your
honor,
both
the
assigned
beneficiaries
and
the
unassigned
beneficiaries
are
beneficiaries
of
the
combined
benefit
fund.
the
combined
benefit
fund
receives
premiums
for
each
beneficiary
from
the
assigned
operator,
if
the
beneficiary
is
assigned.
if
the
beneficiary
is
not
assigned,
as
i
was
starting
to
say
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
there
is
a
complicated
system.
for
the
first
3--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--step
one
is
the
first
3
plan
years.
mr.
peter
buscemi
during
those
3
plan
years,
the
unassigned
beneficiaries
are
paid
for
out
of
the
transfers
from
the
umwa
1950
pension
plan.
those
were
transfers
that
could
not
have
been
made
but
for
the
statute
because
pension
benefits
and
the
health
benefits
are
different.
and
congress
intervened
and
said
there
will
be
$210
million
moving
into
the
combined
fund
from
the
pension
plan.
that
money
is
used
for
unassigned
beneficiaries'
premiums.
it's
used
for
death
benefit
premiums,
and
for
the
first
year
and
the
first
year
only,
it's
used
to
reduced
the
assigned
operators'
assigned
beneficiary
premiums.
so
every
time
the
number
of
unassigned
beneficiaries
goes
up,
a
greater
share
of
that
$210
million
must
be
used
to
pay
for
the
unassigned
beneficiaries.
less
is
left
for
death
benefits
and
to
defray
the
first
year
assigned
beneficiary
premiums,
and
accordingly,
a
supplemental
assessment
is
made
on
all
assigned
operators
when
the
number
of
unassigned
beneficiaries
goes
up.
that's
part
one.
part
two.
beginning
on
october
1,
1995,
congress
says
that
there
shall
be
annual
transfers
from
the
interest
earned
by
the
abandoned
mine
land
reclamation
fund
established
under
the
surface
mining
control
and
reclamation
act.
now,
obviously,
you
can't
transfer
interest
that
you
don't
have.
the
interest
earned
by
the
aml
fund
has
been
declining.
interest
rates
have
been
going
down,
and
accordingly,
the
interest
rates
that
are
earned
by
the
fund
goes
down.
the
fund
at
one
time
earned
$80
million
a
year
in
interest.
it's
now
projected
to
earn
only
30
in
fiscal
2003.
so
there's
a
limit
to
how
much
can
be
transferred
from
the
aml
fund.
the
third
component.
if
the
aml
fund
transfer
is
not
sufficient
to
pay
for
the
beneficiaries,
the
unassigned
beneficiaries,
then
there
must
be
an
unassigned
beneficiary
premium
assessed
against
all
assigned
operators,
thereby
shifting
the
cost
of
these
beneficiaries
from
these
respondents
to
all
assigned
operators.
mr.
peter
buscemi
it
has
not
happened
yet.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
right
now
we're
talking...
if
everyone
nationwide
affected
by
this
case,
if
the
rule
were
to
change,
and
you
were
looking
purely
prospectively,
you
have
about
4,000
people.
but
if
you
go
back
to
the
beginning--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--you
have
about
10,000
people.
mr.
peter
buscemi
and
as
mr.
tennielle's
declaration,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
shows,
there
is
approximately
$105
million
that
was
already
at
stake
as
of
the
time
of
his
declaration
in
1999,
and
that
number
has
been
growing
ever
since.
mr.
peter
buscemi
your
honor,
the
trustees
want
to
see
this
statute
operate
the
way
it's
supposed
to
operate.
the
trustees--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--the
trustee...
it's...
it's
not
a
financial
interest.
the
trustees
believe
that
the
policy
of
the
statute
was
to
have
the
greatest
possible
amount
paid
for
from
the
private
sector
by
the
employers
who
employed
the
beneficiaries,
retired
miners.
and
the
trustees
have
been,
in
each
of
these
cases,
arguing
that
the
system
ought
to
work
the
way
congress
intended.
now,
on
the
applicable
percentage,
i
do
want
to
say
one
thing
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
several
questions
on
this,
and
that
is,
the
"as
of"
language
in
the
statute
is
very
important.
every
time
there
is
a
reassignment
as
a
result
of
an
administrative
appeal,
it's
made
as
of
october
1,
1993.
every
time
there's
an
initial
assignment
made
after
september
30,
1993,
it's
made
as
of
october
1,
1993.
they
all
go
back
to
the
beginning
because
these
beneficiaries
all
need
health
care--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--it
must
be,
your
honor.
it
must
be
because
if
there
is
a
reassignment--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--no.
otherwise
the
statute--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--no,
your
honor,
because
when
there's
a
reassignment
after
an
administrative
appeal,
for
example,
the
reassignment
occurs
in
1995
or
1996.
if
an
administrative
appeal
is
successful
and
there's
a
reassignment,
that
reassignment
is
as
of
october
1,
1993,
even
though
the
reassignment
isn't
made
until
later.
that's
absolutely
plain--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--absolutely,
your
honor.
all
of
these
assignments,
whether
they're
reassignments
after
administrative
appeals,
whether
they're
initial
assignments
during
this
period
when
the
commissioner
was
finishing
the
assignment
process,
they
all
go
back
to
the
beginning.
in
fact,
they
go
back
to
february
1,
1993
because
that's
the
beginning
of
the
first
plan
year.
i
might
say
there
are
many
provisions
in
this
statute
that
say
do
something
by
a
date
certain.
the
trustees
had
to
be
appointed
by
a
date
certain.
the
$70
million
transfers
from
the
'50
pension
plan
had
to
be
by
a
date
certain.
the
merger
of
the
'50
benefit
plan,
the
'74
benefit
plan
into
the
combined
fund
had
to
be
by
a
date
certain.
yet
no
one
would
argue
that
if
any
of
those
dates
was
missed,
then
there
was
no
authority
at
all.
and--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that's
precisely
what
mr.
tennielle's
declaration
points
out,
your
honor.
as
of
the
time
of
his
declaration,
there
had
been
approximately
$105
million
worth
of
payments
by
various
assigned
operators
who
had
received
assignments,
initial
assignments
of
beneficiaries
that
were
made
after
september
30,
1993.
those
amounts
would
have
to
be
refunded
or
credited.
indeed,
the
respondents
in
this
case
sought
just
such
refunds
or
credits.
if
you
look
at
judge
kinneary's
opinion,
for
example,
in
the
bellaire
case
in
the
appendix,
he
grants
a
credit
to
bellaire
in
the
amount
of
the
payments
that
they
made
on
behalf
of
the
beneficiaries
assigned
to
them.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
was
just
responding
to--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--and
we
did.
