justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
limiting
principle
to
your
interpretation?
i
mean,
can
this
go
on
forever
and
ever?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
tell
us
what
percentage
of
the
assignments
were
made
after
the
deadline,
and
how
long
after
the
deadline
was
the
most
recent
assignment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
i
don't
know
whether
the...
the
fallback
position
to
finance
the
unassigned...
the
benefits
for
the
unassigned
miners...
they...
there
are
two...
some
money
comes
out
of
the
first
pension
fund.
later
it
comes
out
of
a
government
fund.
and
then
there's
the
third
possibility
that
that
money
may
run
out
and
the
miners
will
be
assessed
for
the
payment...
for
the
unassigned...
the
companies
will
be
assessed
for
the
payments
for
the
unassigned
miners.
now,
what
is
the
government's
position
with
respect
to
a
company
that,
say,
had
nobody
assigned
prior
to
the
october
date,
but
after
the
october
date,
say,
500
miners
were
assigned?
now,
as
i
read
the
statute,
that
would
mean
the...
that
company
would
have
no
responsibility
to
contribute
to
the
payments
for
the
unassigned
miners.
am
i
right
about
that?
or
would
you
adjust
it
based
on
post-october
assignments?
justice
john
paul
stevens
despite
the
language
of
the
statute
that
justice
scalia
referred
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
roberts,
didn't
you
omit
one
of
the
other
statutory
purposes,
which
was,
insofar
as
possible,
to
assign
responsibility
for
paying
the
benefits
to
the
company
that
had
the
best,
the
closest
connection
with
that
particular
miner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
was
one
of
the
major
purposes,
was
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
will
pay
in
different
amounts.
different
coal
companies
will
be
paying
for
some
of
the
miners
under
your
proposal
rather
than
the
government's
proposal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
specific
hypothetical
that
troubles
me...
let
me
put
it
right
out
on
the
table.
supposing
a
company
had
no
assignments
made
to
its
prior
miners
until
after
october
1st.
if
i
understand
the
system
correctly,
at
the
end
of
the
line,
if
they
have
to
finance
the
payments
for
the
unassigned
miners
out
of
a...
a
pool
contributed
to
by
the
operators,
that
company
will
not
have
to
contribute
to
that
pool.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
mr....
let
me
just
interrupt
you
as
to
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy.
it's
true
for
the
first
and
second
stages
that
it
doesn't
matter,
but
if
you
have
to
go
to
the
third
stage
where
the
unassigned
miners
are
paid
by
the
companies,
then
what
he
says
is
absolutely
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
isn't...
isn't
it
true
that
with
regard
to
the
as...
with
regard
to
as
of
language
that
justice
scalia
is
emphasizing,
isn't
it
true
that
those
post-october
changes
are
made
as
of
the
october
date?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
at
least
the
cancellation
of...
of
an
assignment
would
be
made
as
of
the
earlier
date
even
though
it
took
later...
took
place
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
little
hard
for
me
to
accept
your
argument
that
the
equitable
structure
of
the
statute
is
enhanced
because
the
commissioner
didn't
get
his
work
done
on
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
furthermore,
the
argument
is
that
the
shall
merely
enhances
and
makes
more
meaningful
the
other
shalls.
i
mean,
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
unassigned
pool
wasn't
created
just
for
that
purpose.
it
was
also
created
to
take
care
of
people
who
couldn't
be
hooked
up
with
any
particular
company.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
agree
that
the
default
position
was
not
just
to
take
care
of
the
timing
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
isn't
assumed
it
will
always
be
sufficient,
is
it?
it's
been
sufficient
up
to
now.
but
isn't
it
assumed
that
in
time
that
they
will
have
to
resort
to
a...
a
company
financed
pool
of
money
to
pay
for
the
unassigned
miners?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
not
agree...
i'm
not
sure
you're
responding
to
my
question.
do
you
not
agree
that
there
is
a
significant
possibility,
even
a
likelihood,
that
you'll
reach
the
third
stage
of
financing
for
the
unassigned
pool?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
haven't
eliminated
the
unassigned
pool.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
question
is
who...
who
should
pay
for
those?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
with...
with
one
more
question,
if
i
may?
in
response
to
the
as
of
argument
that
justice
scalia
identified,
mr.
buscemi
gave
a...
a
list
of
a
whole
bunch
of
things
that
are
as
of
october
1st.
what
would
be
your
response
to
his...
his
list
of
as
of
things
that
really
happened
later
than
that
october
date?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
an
express
exception
like
on
the
appointment
date
of
the
trustees
and
so
forth?
