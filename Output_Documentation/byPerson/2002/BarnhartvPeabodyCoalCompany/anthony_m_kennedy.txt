--it
has
to
because
then
you'd
be
paying
more
than
your
share.
you'd
be
paying
based
on
the
assumption
that
you
only
had
x
number
of...
of
permanent
beneficiaries,
but
then
your...
you'd
be
paying
that
premium,
but
then
you
have
additional
beneficiaries
that
you
must
take
care
of
on
their
own
account
because
they're
assigned
to
you.
so
you...
so
you
are
hurt
if
you
can't...
if
you
can't
change
the
formula.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
one
question.
i...
i
take
it's
possible
if
a
company
had
received
assignment
of...
of
all
of
its
employees,
that
it
could
argue
that
it
was
paying
too
much
if
there
wasn't
the
adjustment.
have
any
companies
made
that
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's...
the
next
part
of
justice
o'connor's
question
is...
and
i
had
this
in
mind
also...
is
the
fund
will
always
have
adequate
funds
to
pay
for
the
unassigned
miners,
will
they
not?
the
plans.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the...
the
plans
in
that
sense
aren't
hurt
because
they're...
they're
not
going
to
run
out
of
money.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they're
not
complaining,
as
i
understand
it,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they're
not
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
the
company
which
had
a
full
assignment
is
going
to
be
paying
more
than
its
pro
rata
share.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
even
though
that
there
was...
you
say
there's
rough
justice.
this
is
making
it
even...
even
more
rough,
and
if
the
companies
are
not
paying
the
proportion
of
the...
of
the
benefits
that
the
statutory
scheme
requires.
they're
paying
more.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
that
fund
itself
is
maintained
based
on
the...
your
share
of
fully
assigned
miners.
more,
the
more
you're
assigned,
the
more
you
have
to
pay
to
that
fund.
or
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
universe...
the
universe
of
assigned
and
unassigned
was,
i
don't
think,
intended
by
congress
to
include
people
that
the
commissioner
didn't
get
around
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
that
number
again?
what
is
the
percentage
of
the
unassigned
we're
talking
about
that
were
initially
determined
properly
to
be
unassigned
for
other
criteria?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we're
talking
about
20,000,
and...
and
what's
the
total
universe
that
we're
talking
about
here
of
unassigned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assume
there
is
a
significant
risk.
