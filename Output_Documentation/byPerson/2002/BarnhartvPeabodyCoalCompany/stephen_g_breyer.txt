justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i'm
just...
as
i
understand
it,
which
may
show
i'm
wrong,
the...
the...
all
this
is
about
is,
since
the...
this
receptacle,
the...
the...
what
are
we
calling
it...
the
fund...
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
that's
financed
by
the
coal
companies,
too.
so...
so
that...
aren't...
isn't
the
money
that
we're
just
talking
about
coming
from
them
and...
and...
the
unassigned
people
go
into
a
fund.
the
unassigned
people
go
into
a...
what's
the
word?
it's
escaped
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
harm?
that
is
to
say,
as
you
agree...
i
think
we
both
agree
there
are
many
statutes
with
deadlines
in
them.
there
are
regulatory
statutes
set,
health
regulations
by
such
and
such
a
date
set,
consumer,
trucking
regulations.
and
the
courts
regularly
say
that
those
dates,
even
though
they
use
words
like
shall,
are
not
fixed
because
obviously
congress
wanted
the
regulations
written,
even
if
late.
well,
here
they're
saying
this
is
roughly
the
same
thing.
obviously,
congress
would
have
wanted
this
assigned
in
the
principle
of
pay
for
your
own
way,
and
nobody
is
hurt
by
doing
that
late.
nobody
is
really
hurt.
now,
i
want
you
to
reply
to
that.
what's
the
down
side
of
trying
to
interpret
this
like
we'd
interpret
other
regulatory
statutes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
way
that
you
or
your
clients
or
anyone
have
been
hurt
by
the
delay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is...
how?
how
were
you
hurt
specifically
by
the
delay
compared
with
if
they
had
done
it
all
perfectly
within
5
minutes?
imagine
they
got
the
same
assignments
on
time.
now
imagine
they
got
them
late,
and
how
are
you
hurt
by
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
have
different
meanings.
it
has
the
same
meaning.
but
in
fact,
it
doesn't
tell
you
what
happens
if
you
don't
do
it.
all
right.
so
they
didn't
do
it.
now
what?
if
you
don't
do
what
it
says,
then
what?
and
there
the
statute
is
silent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
it's
a...
look.
it's
not
a
linguistic
point.
the
point
is,
what
happens
if
you
don't
do
it,
what
you
shall
do?
and
there,
the
consequence
in
the
case...
you
said
you
couldn't
go
back.
you're
absolutely
right.
and
now
our
question
is
what's
the
consequence
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
their...
their
reassignments
cost
your
clients
money.
i
understand
that.
what
i
don't
quite
understand
is
mr.
roberts'
point
which
he
mentioned.
if
they're
right
in
the
case...
i
mean,
if...
if
you're
right
in
the
case,
then
other
companies
should
have
had
to
pay
more,
isn't
that
right,
to
balance
what
you
paid
by
way
of
less?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
why
weren't
they
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
case?
i'm
genuinely
puzzled
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
my
understanding.
so
i
would
appreciate
why
they
aren't...
i
mean,
mr.
roberts
brought
that
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'm
just
curious
why
they're
not
here.
