mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
with
a
legal
point,
and
i
want
to
start
by
looking
at
9706(a),
which
i'm
sure
you
have
handy.
i'm
going
to...
9706(a).
i'm
going
to
be
reading
from
the
red
brief,
bellaire's
brief,
at
a19.
and
this
is
the
assignment
provision
we've
been
discussing.
and
there
are
two
things
that
are
important
about
the
language
of
9706(a).
the
first
is,
of
course,
that
it
says,
shall
before
october
1st,
1993,
and
i
think
you
understand
our
arguments
there.
but
the
second
point--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--the
bellaire--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--a19,
9706(a),
section
(a),
9706(a).
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
the...
the
first
point
you
notice
is
the
shall
before
october
1st,
1993
language.
and
of
course,
you...
we've
made
our
point
there.
but
the
second
point
is
that
it's
the
same
shall
term
that
modifies
other
clearly
mandatory
jurisdictional
requirements
under
the
act.
the
commissioner
would
agree
that
she
had
no
option
of
assigning
these
miners
to
nonsignatories
or
to
assigning
them
to
people
that
were
out
of
business
or
to
not
following
the
statutory
prescribed
order
of
priority.
it's
one
term,
shall.
as
the
court
made
it
clear
in
another
deadline
case,
mohasco,
we're
going
to
assume
the
same
word
has
the
same
meaning
throughout
and--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
your
honor,
i...
i'm
not
aware
of
a
case
from
this
court
that
has
said
one
word
in
one
sentence
can
have
different
meanings
in
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
the
point--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
there's
just
one
shall.
and
the
petitioners
would
agree
that
there's
a
clear
consequence
if
they
had
not
assigned
to
a
signatory
operator.
why
isn't
there
the
same
mandatory--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
the
consequence
here...
and
that's
what
makes
this
an
easy
case...
is
the
fact
that
unlike
pierce
county,
the
statute
did
provide
a
consequence.
it
did
provide
a
fail-safe
safety
net
for
all
miners.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
the
proof,
your
honor,
that
this
was
not
that
mysterious
in
terms
of
language
is
the
fact
that
the
commissioner
had
no
problem
doing
what...
just
what
we
say
the
statute
required.
as
of
october
1st,
1993,
she
did
just
what
congress
said
she
should
do,
which
is
to
divide
the
world
of
miners
into
two
parts,
assigned
or
unassigned.
after
october
1st,
1993...
and
keep
in
mind
this
was
a
statutory
beginning,
not
a
statutory--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
no.
of
course,
the
statute
wouldn't
have
worked
in
that
setting.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
there's
no
doubt,
you
would
have
required
a
congressional
fix.
but
the
point--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--but
the
point
i'm
making
is
there
were
only
5,000
out
of
these
80,000
miners
that
they
ran
out
of
time
on.
as
of
october
1st,
what
did
they
do
with
these
miners?
they
put
them
in
the
unassigned
pool.
the
statute
has
very
specific
requirements
for
transferring--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--but
to
use
justice
souter's
words,
all
default
provisions
cover
everything.
it
would
be
an
odd
safety
net
that
said,
some
in
and
some
out.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
of
course,
not.
but...
but
this
gets
to--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
there's
one
thing
that
congress
clearly
appreciated,
and
let's
make
sure
we're...
i...
i
make
this
clear.
of
the
10,000
people
that
have
been
reassigned,
i.e.,
original
assignments
after
the
date,
7,500
are
folks
that
the
commissioner
originally
did,
quote,
"designate"
in
the
unassigned
pool.
they
reviewed
the
records.
they
looked
at
them.
they
said,
we
can't
find
anyone
to
whom
they
belong.
they're
going
to
the
unassigned
pool.
now,
the
proof
that
congress
contemplated
that
possibility
is
exactly
the
administrative
review
provisions
we've
been
talking
about.
what
were
they
about?
fact
error.
and
so
they
were
aware
of--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--20,000
were
initially
decided.
if
you
look
at
the
herrin
affidavit
at
ja179
to
1984,
it
specifically
says
that
20,000
were
initially
designated
unassigned.
and
this
proves
mr.
roberts'
point
that
what's
going
on
here
is
not
a
missed
deadline
case.
they
met
the
deadline.
what's
going
on
is
they
decided
to
reinvent
the
task.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
oh,
well,
they
started
with
80,000
altogether.
i'm
making
the
point
that
20,000
were
initially
designated
unassigned.
out
of
that
20,000,
7,500
later
they
decided
we
can
do
a
better
job
with
that.
and
our
point...
our
point
is...
i
mean,
there's
a
cost-benefit
analysis
here.
congress
could
have
said,
commissioner
of
social
security,
you
can
keep
doing
this
into
perpetuity
until
you
get
the
job
just
right.
they
didn't
say
that.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
but,
your
honor,
i
mean--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
that's
an
important
question.
but
ultimately,
it's
robbing
peter
to
pay
peter.
all
of
these
funds,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
came
from
coal
companies.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
because
of
the
cushion.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
the
cushion,
your
honor.
the
cushion.
a
critical
part
of
the
compromise
that
led
to
the
enactment
of
the
act
was
a
cushion
of
funds
to
provide
for
the
benefits
of
unassigned
beneficiaries.
that
cushion
has
been
sufficient.
so
there's
no...
there's...
there's
not
been
a
concern
yet
for
this
pro
rata--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--your
honor,
the
government
all
the
time
relies
on
much
less
reliable
proxies
than
this
one.
keep
in
mind
that
93
to
94
percent
of
these
miners'
records
were
reviewed.
the
risk
that
somehow
this
pro
rata
unassigned
beneficiary
premium
is
going
to
awkwardly
hurt
one
company
i
think
is
fanciful.
i
can't
imagine
how
that
could
happen
given
the
numbers--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
don't
know,
and
the
reason
i
don't
know
is
that
you...
these
aml
transfers
have
done
the
job.
since
1995
they
have
done
the
job,
and
this
is
a
declining
population.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
they
haven't.
of
course,
not.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
the
rough
justice
calculation
that
the
congress
made
is
we're
going
to
do
it
on
a
pro
rata
basis.
if
i
could
just
step
back
for
one
second,
i
think
this,
i
hope,
puts
the
1992
decision
in
context.
through...
from
1946
forward,
they
paid
for
these
benefits
in
two
ways.
one
was
pay
for
your
own.
the
employer
paid
for
his
or
her
employee.
and
the
second
one
was
pay
as
a
group.
they've
been
doing
that
through...
since
1946.
that's
what
the
aml
tax
does.
that's
on
all
coal
companies.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
right.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
there's...
there's...
i'm
sorry.
there's
clearly
some
point
at
which
the
wheels
of
the
statute
would
fall
off,
but
i
think
from
the
court's
perspective
of
construing
what
the
statute
means,
it's
appropriate
to
assume
the
commissioner
is
going
to
act
in
good
faith.
she
did
act
in
good
faith.
she
did
get--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
mean
to
be
saying
that.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
the
bigger
problem
would
have
been
the
assigned
miners
and
they
wouldn't
have
had
enough
money
to
pay
for
them.
when
i
say
the
wheels
fall
off
the
statute,
if
they
didn't
get
this
job
done
by
october
1st,
they've
got
a
very
serious
problem
on
their
hands
because
the
statutory
beginning
that
starts
on
that
date
is
they
began
sending
out
these
premium
requirements.
the
first
ones
went
out
on
october
22nd,
1993.
and
if
they
hadn't
done
a
sufficient
number,
you
wouldn't
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
their
benefits.
you'd
be
back--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--those
were
used
primarily
for
unassigned.
they
were
used
some
to
help
with
assigned,
but
most
were
used
to
pay
for
unassigned
benefits.
so
that's
the
point
i'm
making
there.
i'd
like
to
make
a
point
about
pierce
county
that
i
think
is
helpful
in
thinking
about
deadline
cases
in
general.
here's
why
we're
not
saying
that
when
a
statute
says
you
must
complete
this
foia
request
in
20
days,
our...
our
case
would
control
it.
in
pierce
county,
as
in
that
situation,
these
governmental
agencies
have
preexisting
general
grants
of
authority
to
do
these
acts;
i.e.,
go
get
misspent
federal
funds.
there
are
general
statutes.
there
was
one
in
pierce
county.
if
you
look
at
page
257
of
pierce
county,
the
plaintiff
conceded
there
was
otherwise
jurisdiction
to
get
this
money.
here...
and
so
what
pierce
county
means
is
we're
not
going
to
say
there's
a
repeal
by
implication
of
that
general
grant
of
authority
merely
because
we
now
have
another
statute
that
says
do
it
quickly,
get
it
done.
that's
not
this
case.
9706(a)
is
the
only
provision
either
petitioner
has
pointed
to
that
gives
you
this
grant
of
authority.
so
the
grant
comes
with
a
limit.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
there
are
express
exceptions
to
the
october
1st
deadline,
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
sigmon,
you
follow
the
russello
rule.
they
knew
about
the
possibility--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
the
other
shalls.
i'm
sorry.
the
other
shall...
i'm
sorry.
thank
you.
the
other
shalls
throughout
this
statute...
you've
got
two
different
issues
there.
one
of
them
is
that
they
apply...
there's
no
contingency
plan
if
you
miss.
here
we've
got
a
contingency
plan.
that's
one
inference.
the
second
is
they
all
regulate
private
entities.
this
goes
back
to
the
point
i
just
made
about
pierce
county.
if
a
private
entity
is
told
do
something
by
this
date,
they
don't
do
it,
a
court
clearly
has
authority
to
say,
we
said
do
it
by
this
date,
do
it.
they
had...
they
had...
you
don't
have
a
authority
problem
with
a
private
entity.
they
can
do
what
they
want.
with
the
government,
however,
and
particularly
when
it
comes
to
these
extraordinary
retroactive
assignments
of
liability,
the
commissioner
is
not
born
with
that
authority.
it's
not
inappropriate
to
ask
the
government
to
turn
square
corners
in
that
kind
of
a
setting
as
opposed
to
a
setting
where
they're
merely
exercising
a
general
power
to
get
misspent
federal
funds,
fulfill
a
foia
request.
there--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--by
the
statute.
it
says
that
if
they...
if
a
company
goes
out
of
a...
goes
into
bankruptcy,
we're
going
to
alter
the
applicable
percentage
as
of
october
1st,
1993
because
they
went
into
bankruptcy.
if
there's
a
reassignment,
it
goes
back
to
october
1st.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
let's
go
back
to
it
right
here.
you've
got...
in
the
provision
you're
talking
about,
9704(f),
the
applicable
percentage,
it
has
the
general
rule.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
a13
of
the
appendix.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
the
general
rule
is
stated
in
9704(f)
and
then
you
have
the
adjustments
to
the
general
rule.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
then
it
says,
look
at
number
2:
by
making
the
following
changes
to
the
assignments
as
of
october
1st,
1993.
they...
they
stuck
with
it.
i
mean,
they
understood
what
was
going
on,
and
that's...
that's
what's
so
inappropriate
here.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
mean,
justice
ginsburg,
you
made
the
point
that
there's
no
interest
running
on
this,
but
keep
in
mind
we
don't
get
interest
when
they
make
mistakes
on
our
assignments.
that's
a
wash.
right?
i
mean,
if
they
mistakenly
assign
someone
to
us,
we
don't
get
interest
there.
but...
thank
you,
your
honor.
