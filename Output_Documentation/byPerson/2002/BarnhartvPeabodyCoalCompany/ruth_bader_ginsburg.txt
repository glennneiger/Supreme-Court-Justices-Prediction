when
there
is
a
reassignment
or
taking
somebody
out
of
the
unassigned
pool
and
attributing
that
person
to
an
operator,
does
the
operator
who
has
now
gotten
the
assignment
have
to
pay
interest
for
the
period
from
october
'93
on,
or
is
it
just
that
you
pay
now
the
bill
that
we
would
have
sent
you
if
we
had
charged
you
in
'93?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
the
argument
that
the
social
security
administration
stood
before
congress
and
said,
we
can
make
this
date?
then
the
operators
who
might
be
saddled
with
additional
responsibility
could
breathe
easily
and
say,
well,
we
don't
have
to
set
up
any
reserve
for
the
assignment
of
more
operators
to
us.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there
were
quotations
in
the
record
that
had
an
official
from
the
social
security
administration
telling
congress
we
are
going
to
do
it.
it
was
more
than,
it's
a
hope.
i...
i
don't
have
that
at
my
fingertips
now.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
hasn't
happened
yet
in
fact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
you
have
to
give
back
money
if...
if
your
side
does
not
prevail?
then
these
payments
have
been
made...
the
assignments
that
were
made,
payments
have
been
made
as
of
october
1,
'93.
and
wouldn't
the
fund
have
to
give
those
payments
back?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
roberts,
on
the
other
hand,
you
are,
in
fact
your
companies
are
paying
less
than
they
would
have
paid
had
they
been
billed
properly
on
time
because
you
have
had
the
use
of
the
money
in
the
interim,
and
ms.
mcdowell
said
you're
not
being
charged
any
interest
because
you're
paying
in
19...
or
any
adjustment
for
inflation
because
you
get
to
pay
in
19-whatever,
'97
dollars
a
bill
that
was
due
from
october
1993
and
you
don't
get
charged
any
interest
on
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
my...
my
point
is
simply
had
you
gotten
that
bill,
that...
timely,
it
would
have
been
more
costly
than
getting
the
bill
later
because
you
have
had
the
use
of
the
money
in
the
interim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is...
i
mean,
congress
did
provide
that
if
you
think
you
were
assigned
people
who
belonged
to
someone
else,
you
can
complain
and
then
there's
an
adjustment
long
after
the
1993--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
congress
didn't
think
so,
at
least
the
congress
that
made
an
appropriation
so
that
the...
the
administration
could
get
the
job
done.
there
was
a
supplemental
appropriation,
wasn't
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
part
of
it
was
supposed
to
be
spent
to
enable
the
administration
to
finish
the
job.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
supplemental
appropriation
was
made
after
october
1st,
1993.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
would
that
money
go?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
secretary
had
gotten
around
to
only
half
instead
of
what
it
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
saying
she
couldn't...
she...
she
should
not
have
tried
to
make
it
perfect.
it
was
good
enough
for
government
work.
but
suppose
it
was
only...
she...
she
was
much
slower
and
she
only
did,
say,
one-third.
then
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
say
it
would
fall
off,
do
you
mean
that
in
that
event,
if
she
had
been
slower
than
she
was,
then
she
would
have
been
permitted
to
make
assignments
after
the
deadline?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
would
have
happened?
let's
say
she
did
only
one-third
of
the
job
and
you
had
this
large
pool
of
unassigned
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
first
3
years
they
got
the
money
from
the
pension
fund.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
the
interest
be
used
for
if
it
weren't
being
used
to
make
up
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
they
said
that...
they
answered
that
by
saying,
how
did
we
know
there
was
going
to
be?
we
didn't
know
there
was
going
to
be
anything
reassigned
to
us.
