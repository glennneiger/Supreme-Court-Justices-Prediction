but
that's
not
true.
in
fact,
if
later
research
has
showed
that
somebody
should
have
been
assigned
somewhere
else,
you...
you
don't
shift
the
beneficiaries.
it...
it
isn't
the
case
that...
that
this
is
designed
to
assure
a
perfect
system
in
which
somebody
who
is
responsible,
no
matter
that
a
mistake
was
made
in
the
past,
in
the
future
that
person
will
be
reassigned
the
way
he
should
be.
justice

ms.
mcdowell,
what
do
you
do
with
the
provision
of
9704(a)(3)(d)
which
makes
an
assigned
operator's
unassigned
beneficiaries'
premium
equal
to
the
operator's
applicable
percentage,
which
is
defined
as
its
percentage
of
total
assigned
beneficiaries,
quote,
"determined
on
the
basis
of
assignments
as
of
october
1,
1993?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
but...
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
does
not
make
a
third
exception;
that
is,
a
change
is
made
as
a
result
of
the...
the
finding
of
additional
assigned
beneficiaries
under
the...
under
the
commissioner's
ability
to...
to
find
it
after
october
1.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
what
does...
what
does
suggest
that
is
the
language,
determined
on
the
basis
of
assignments
as
of
october
1,
1993.
and
then
there's
no
provision
for...
elsewhere
that
would
enable
you
to...
to
make
the
other
adjustment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
it
isn't
essential
but
it
makes--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
still
don't
see
your
basis
for
doing
it.
you
say
it's
flexible
enough,
but
you're
confronted
with
language
that
says
it
will
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
assignments
as
of
october
1,
1993.
i
mean,
there
it
is.
it
says
it
in
cold,
hard
language.
there
is
no...
no
exception
elsewhere
to
do
what
you
say
there's
flexibility
to
do.
where
do
you
get
the
flexibility
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
it
didn't
foreclose?
yes,
it
did.
it
said,
determined
on
the
basis
of
assignments
as
of
october
1,
19...
what...
what
more
does
it
have
to
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
other...
exactly.
that...
that
makes
it
even
clearer
that
except
for
those
expressed
exceptions,
everything
else
has
to
be
done
as
of
october
1.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
read
that
language
that
way.
it...
it
says
applicable
percentage
is
defined
as
the
percentage
of
total
assigned
beneficiaries
determined
on
the
basis
of
assignments
as
of
october
1,
1993.
you're...
you're
telling
me
that
means
assignments
made
later,
but
that
you
say
on
their
face,
we're
making
these
retroactive
to
october
1,
1993?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
must
be
because
otherwise
your
theory
doesn't
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
the
other
side's
theory
of
the
case
is...
is
correct.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course.
they
were
assigned
incorrect...
i
mean,
what's
so
extraordinary
about
that?
it
just
means
you've
been
collecting
money
from
the
wrong
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
would
hope
you
give
it
back.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
you're...
unless
you're
a
company
that
had
bought
a
company
which,
which
had
that
switch
pulled,
in
which
case
you're...
you're
out
of
pocket
a
good
deal.
despite
the
fact
that
you're...
that
it's
less
money
than...
than
would
have
been
charged
originally,
it's
coming
out
of
your
pocket
when
you
bought
a
coal
company
that
you
did
not
believe
had
that
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so
you...
you
admit
that
that
language
doesn't
really
mean
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
can
do
it
with
a
reassignment,
why
can't
you
do
it
with
an
initial
assignment?
justice
antonin
scalia
without
doing
violence
to
the
language?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sutton,
i...
i
thought
that
or
maybe
i
just
hoped
that
justice
stevens
was...
was
asking
about
why
it
is
that
the...
the
crucial
language
determined
on
the
basis
of
assignments
of
october
1,
1993
is
in
fact
not
so
crucial,
that...
that
as
mr.
buscemi
said,
there
are
other
instances
in
which
something
was
not
determined
before
october
1,
1993,
but
nonetheless,
it
is
deemed
to
have
been
determined
before
october
1,
1993.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
does
the
statute
say
it
goes
back
to
october
1st?
does
the
statute
say
the
reassignment
shall
be
deemed
to
have
been
made
as
of
october
1?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that?
what
page?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
