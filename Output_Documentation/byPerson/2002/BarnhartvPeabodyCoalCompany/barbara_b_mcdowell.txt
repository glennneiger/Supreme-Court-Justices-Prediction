ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
coal
act
states
that
the
commissioner
of
social
security
shall,
before
october
1st,
1993,
assign
each
beneficiary
to
a
signatory
coal
operator
or
related
person
that
remains
in
business.
that
provision
understood,
in
light
of
this
court's
precedents,
establishes
the
deadline
that
is
mandatory
but
not
jurisdictional.
it
does
not
deprive
the
commissioner
of
the
power
or
the
obligation
to
complete
the
assignments
after
that
date,
if
necessary.
that
understanding
comports
with
the
text
and
structure
of
the
coal
act,
as
well
as
with...
with
one
of
its
central
purposes,
that
to
the
maximum
extent
possible,
each
coal
retiree's
benefits
would
be
paid
for
by
a
coal
operator
that
actually
employed
that
miner
or
a
related
person.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
the
statute
does
provide
for
administrative
review
of
assignment
so
that
a
coal
operator
who
was
assigned
a
miner
in
error
could
challenge
that
before
the
commissioner,
and
if
the
commissioner
found
that
the
assignment
was
erroneous,
the
miner
could
be
assigned
to
a...
a
more
appropriate
coal
operator.
in
addition,
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
commissioner
for
the
administrative
review
process
allowed
the
commissioner
herself
to
reopen
an
assignment
if
she
found
that
it
had
been
erroneous
within
a
1-year
period.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no.
congress
did
provide
a
fallback
position
for
all
of
those
who
weren't
assigned
by
october
1st
or...
or
at
any
time
because
they
had
no
former
employer
or
related
person
who
remained
in
business,
and
that
is,
that
they
will
be
treated
as
part
of
the
unassigned
beneficiary
pool.
the
benefits
for
those
miners
are
paid
from
an
appropriation
from
the
aml
fund,
a
fund
originally
created
to
ameliorate
the
problems
of
abandoned
mines,
and
if
that
fund
proves
insufficient,
the
funds
will
come
from
a...
a
premium
imposed
on
all
of
the
coal
operators
to
whom
beneficiaries
who
have
been
assigned.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
think
the
situation
addressed
in
that
provision
is
quite
different,
even
assuming
that
it
unequivocally
establishes
that
the
commissioner
couldn't
reassign
somebody
after
a
company
went
into
bankruptcy.
but
assignments
at
the
outset
of
the
process,
the
sorts
of
assignments
that
we're
concerned
with
here,
are
quite
different
from
an
assignment
after
bankruptcy
that
could
occur
20,
30,
or
40
years
down
the
road,
and
congress
may
well
have
been
interested
only
in
achieving
a
correct
initial
assignment
at
the
outset
and
not
with
continuing
to
readjust
the
assignments--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
that's
correct.
but
the
fact
that
the...
that
congress
directed
that
the
applicable
percentage
for
calculating
the
assigned
beneficiary
premium
shall
be
adjusted
in
certain
circumstances
doesn't
suggest
to
us
that
congress
would
not
have
permitted
it
to
be
adjust
in
other...
adjusted
in
other
circumstances
as
well
that
congress
may
not
have
explicitly
contemplated
at
the
time
that
the
coal
act
was
enacted.
one
of
those
was
the
fact
that--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
there's...
there's
no
indication
in
the
text
or
legislative
history
that
that
was
contemplated.
and
indeed,
since
congress
was
legislating
in
light
of
this
court's
opinions
in
pierce
county
and
montalvo-murillo,
the
provision
could
not
readily
be
understood
as
providing
coal
operators
with
that
sort
of
assurance.
in
addition--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--congress
didn't
explicitly
say
so,
no,
but
as,
we
have
cited
a
number
of
statutes
in
our
briefs
that
made
clear
that
when
congress
wants
to
terminate
an
agency's
authority
to
make
decisions
at
a
particular
point,
congress
knows
how
to
say
so
explicitly
and
it
has
done
so
in
those
situations.
it
has
not
done
so
here.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
i
think
it's
clear
that
congress
imposed
deadlines,
not
only
this
deadline,
but
other
deadlines
in
the
statute,
because
it
wanted
to
get
the
new
funding
mechanism
established
by
the
coal
act
into
place.
congress
wanted
the
assignments
to
be
made
promptly
so
that
the
combined
fund
could
then
send
bills
for
premiums
to
assigned
operators.
but
it
wasn't
essential
to
that
scheme
that
every
last
assignment
was
made
by
october
1st,
and
there's
no
indication
that
congress
adopted
the
deadline
in
order
to
provide
any
sort
of
certainty
to
coal
operators.
to
paraphrase
the
court's
decision
in
james
daniel
good,
it
would
seem
somewhat
curious
that
a
deadline
that
was
intended
to
expedite
the
collection
of
premiums
by
the
combined
fund
could
be
construed
to
prevent
the
combined
fund
in
some
circumstances
from
collecting
premiums
at
all.
and
that's
the
effect
of--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--oh,
the
statute
doesn't
itself
impose
a
limit
on
the
commissioner's
authority.
however,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
commissioner
has
not
made
initial
assignments
for
more
than
5
years
now
and
has
no
intent
to
recommence
them.
obviously,
congress
can
cut
off
the
authority
to
do
this
at...
at
any
particular
time
by
denying
an
appropriation
for
the
process
or
by
doing
it
explicitly.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
the...
to
answer
your
last
question
first,
the
last
one
was
made
in
1997.
congress
made
a
total
of
approximately...
rather,
the
commissioner
made
a
total
of
approximately
40,000
assignments
before
the
deadline,
in
addition
to
another
15,000,
approximately,
assignments
that
the
coal
operators
had
agreed
to.
after
the
deadline,
the
commissioner
made
10,000
more
assignments.
a
quarter
of
those
were
made
in
october
1993
or
a
handful
in
february
1994.
the
rest
were
made
primarily
in
1995
and
1996
and
a
few
more,
about
55,
in
1997.
and
the
process
has
been
completed.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
latter.
there's
no
interest
charged.
so
to
the
extent--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--the
operator
benefits
by
having
the
use
of
the
money
during
the
period
before
the
obligation
is
imposed.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
commissioner
didn't
say
we
will
make
the
deadline.
the
commissioner
did
express
optimism
in
september
of
1993
that
the
deadline
could
be
complied
with.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
think
it
could
have
been
only
an
expression
of
hope
in...
in
september
1993,
and
then
the
operators
would
have
received,
in
many
cases,
and...
and
these
respondents
certainly
did...
assignments
of
additional
beneficiaries
during
october
1993,
so
that
should
have
put
them
on
notice
to
make
inquiry
as
to
precisely
when
the
assignment
had
been
made.
i
think
a
particularly
more
telling
and...
and
earlier
statement
from
a...
an
acting
commissioner
came
in
february
1993
when
the
acting
commissioner
was
testifying
before
a
house
appropriations
subcommittee.
he
said
at
that
point
that
it
did
not
appear
that
the
assignments
could
be
completed
by
the
deadline.
one
member
of
congress
asked,
well,
what
is
the...
the
crucial
date,
then?
when
is
it
that
beneficiaries
will
lose
benefits
if
the
assignments
aren't
made?
and
the
acting
commissioner
went
on
to
explain
that,
well,
because
there
was
a...
a
$70
million
transfer
coming
into
the
combined
fund
on
october
1st,
1993
from
the
united
mine
workers
1950
pension
fund,
there
would
be
money
in
the
combined
fund
for
some
time
to
pay
benefits,
and
that
the
assignments
could
be
done
on
a
rolling
basis
to
bring
money
into
the
fund.
so
it
was
clearly
understood
at
that
point
that
there
was
no
jurisdictional
cutoff
of
the
time
to
make
assignments
contemplated
by
the
statute.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
statute
then
goes
on
to
provide
for
adjustments
in
years
after
1993
for
two
circumstances:
when
a
change
has
been
made
as
a
result
of
the
administrative
review
process,
and
when
a
change
has
been
made
as
a
result
of
coal
operators
going
out
of
business.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
and
the
fact
that
congress--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
fact
that
congress
said
that
these
adjustments
shall
be
made
doesn't
suggest
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
permit
other
appropriate
adjustments
to
be
made
as
well.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
congress
was
obviously
contemplating,
at
the
point
that
it
enacted
the
statute,
that
the
deadline
would
be
made,
satisfied.
so
it's...
it's
therefore
somewhat
understandable
that
congress
didn't
discuss
all
the
permutations
of
what
would
happen
if...
if
the
deadline
was,
in
fact,
not
satisfied.
and
an
additional
point
is
even
if
one
assumed
that
the
unassigned
beneficiary
premium,
the
applicable
percentage
used
to
calculate
it
had
to
remain
fixed
as
of
october
1st,
1993,
that
doesn't
really
address
the
commissioner's
assignment
authority
after
that
date,
and
it
is
not
essential
to
the
statute--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
significantly
change
the...
the
percentage
of
the
whole
that
the
operator
would
be
required
to
pay
for.
but
in
any
event,
in
practice
the
combined
fund
has
gone
back
and
taken
subsequent
assignments,
just
like
subsequent
reassignments,
into
account
in
calculating
the
applicable
percentage,
and
the
statutory
scheme
has
worked
quite
satisfactorily
in
that
respect.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i'm
not
aware
of
any
company
in
that
situation,
but
i
think
it
would
be
adjusted
for
post-october
assignments
as
well.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
it's
flexible
enough
to
allow
those
additional
adjustments
to
be
taken
into
account.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
a
task
that's
left
to
the
combined
fund
to
do.
it's
not
an
adjustment
that
the
commissioner
herself
made.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
you
know,
i
think
the
commissioner
typically
made
one
round
of
assignments
a
year
during
the
time--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--when
she
was
making
additional
assignments.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
sometimes
two
rounds,
i
believe.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
congress
didn't
foreclose
additional
adjustments
to
be
assigned
beneficiary
premium
in
addition
to
those
specified
in
the
statute.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
then
if
you
will
turn
to
the
next
subsection
of
the
statute,
it
provides
for
adjustments
for
plan
years
after
1993.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
in
any
event,
your
honor,
that
particular
provision
is
a
separate
section
of
the
statute
from
one
addressing
the
commissioner's
assignment
authority.
it
doesn't
provide
the
sort
of
clear
and
unambiguous
indication
that
congress
intended
to
prevent
the
commissioner
after
the
statutory
deadline
from
completing
the
task
that
congress
thought
was
important.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
that
is
certainly
how
it
has
been
applied.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
has
been
applied
flexibly
and
adjustments
in
the
applicable
percentage
have
been
made
retroactively.
thank
you.
i'll
reserve.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
justice
breyer
asked
why
there
weren't
coal
companies
on
our
side
of
the
courtroom.
it's
because
we,
that
is,
the
federal
government,
has
been
paying
through
the
aml
fund
for
the
benefits
for
the
last
few
years.
it
appears
that
in
the
next
few
years
that
interest
is
going
to
run
out,
and
at
that
point,
there
will
be
coal
operators
who
will
be
bearing
a
larger
burden
through
the
unassigned
beneficiaries'
premium.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
would
be
used
for
correcting
the
severe
health
and
safety
problems
caused
by
abandoned
mines
from
the
period
before
1977.
the
suggestion
was
made
that
coal
operators
were
being
denied
certainty
in
making
transactions.
if
that
had
actually
been
a
concern,
there
is
a
remedy
provided
by
the
administrative
procedure
act,
section
7061,
an
action
for
administrative
action
unreasonably
delayed.
a
coal
operator
conceivably
could
have
brought
an
action
under
that
statute.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
they
received
initial
assignments
at...
for
the
first
time
in
october
1993.
that
was
at
a
time
when
no
reassignments
were
being
made
through
the
administrative
review
process.
it
therefore
should
have
occurred
to
them
that
these
were
post-october
1st,
1993
assignments.
in
terms
of
there
having
been
a
political
compromise
that
the
october
1st,
1993
date
would
have
jurisdictional
effect,
in
light
of
pierce
county
and
montalvo-murillo,
no
such
compromise
could
be
assumed.
