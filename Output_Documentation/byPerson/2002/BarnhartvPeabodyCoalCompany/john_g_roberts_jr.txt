mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners'
position
is
that
when
congress
said
shall
before
october
1st,
1993,
it
meant
may
before
or
after
october
1st,
1993.
that
is
so,
according
to
the
petitioners
because,
as
they
read
the
statute,
congress
could
not
really
have
intended
to
limit
the
authority
of
the
commissioner
to
make
assignments
under
the
act.
but
there
is
nothing
implausible
or
even
unusual
about
reading
the
statute
to
mean
what
it
says.
the
consequence
of
not
assigning
a
particular
miner
by
the
statutory
deadline
is
that
the
miner
is
unassigned
under
the
statute.
the
statute
tells
us
what
to
do
with
unassigned
miners.
there
is
an
elaborate
backup
provision,
as
the
solicitor
general
calls
it,
to
deal
with
unassigned
beneficiaries.
first
and
foremost,
they
receive
the
same
benefits
as
assigned
miners.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly.
first
of
all,
from
congress's
point
of
view,
the
overriding
purpose
is
to
continue
benefits.
that's
taken
care
of.
second,
the
coal
miners
get
the
same
benefits
whether
they're
assigned
or
unassigned.
now,
but
the
argument
is
this
undermines
the
pay
for
your
own
principle.
but
the
pay
for
your
own
principle
itself
is...
embodies
rough
justice.
a
company
that
employs
a
miner
for
2
years
pays
for
all
his
benefits.
another
company
may
have
employed
him
for
25
years.
that's
the
compromise
that
was
agreed
to
and
that's
fine.
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
this
pay
for
your
own
principle
is
some
unqualified
desideratum
that
you
can
assume
congress
intended
to
pursue
at
all
costs
in
perpetuity.
we
know
that's
not
the
case.
they
had
a
deadline
and
they
imposed
it.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
and
we
know
that
was,
for
example,
not
a
purpose
they
wanted
to
pursue
ueber
alles.
if
a
company
goes
bankrupt,
those
miners--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
was
one
of
the
purposes,
yes,
and
it
was
one
that
congress
said,
spend
a
year
trying
to
make
these
assignments.
but
then
we've
got
to
launch
this
fund
and--
what
is
really
going
on
here
is
that
the
commissioner
wants
to
do
a
different
sort
of
job
than
congress
delegated
to
her.
this
is
the
sort
of
project...
and
i
think
this
is
a
critical
distinction
from
the
deadlines
in
pierce
county
and
those
sorts
of
cases.
the
agency
could
have
done
a
reasonably
good
job
on
this
project
in
4
months,
a
better
job
in
a
year,
maybe
a
nearly
perfect
job
in
5
years.
congress
said,
we
want
the
1-year
version.
why
do
we
want
the
1-year
version
and
not
the
nearly
perfect
version?
because
the
miners
are
going
to
get
the
same
benefits
either
way.
coal
companies
or
funds
established
by
coal
companies
are
going
to
pay
for
them
either
way.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
and
the
question
is--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
that's
right.
if
it
had
no
assignments.
now,
congress--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
congress
knew--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
congress
knew
there
was
some
unfairness
in
requiring
the
companies
to
pay
for
unassigned
beneficiaries,
and
it
cushioned
that
unfairness
by
saying
we're
going
to
draw
from
this
aml
fund
that
coal
operators
established
earlier.
that
will...
it
has
to
date
ensured
that
there
is
no
unassigned
beneficiaries--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
that...
it's
a
preexisting
fund
that
was
established
based,
i
believe,
on
per-ton
royalties.
the
point
is
everybody
is
contributing
in
different
amounts
to
establish--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
you
have
to
get
to
the
third
stage
where
there's
an
unassigned
beneficiaries
premium
assessed,
yes.
it's
done
pro
rata.
and
peabody
coal,
for
example,
will
have
a
very
sizeable
bill
if
that
reaches
it
because
they
have
over
4,000
assigned
miners.
this
case
is
about
330
miners
who
were
assigned
after
october
1st.
but
the
point
is
not
whether
you
could
write
a
funding
mechanism
that
is
more
equitable
or
fair.
it's
a
question
of
whether
that's
the
one
that
congress
wrote.
congress--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well...
well,
it's
not
like
the
other
regulatory
statutes,
first
of
all,
because
it's
an
extraordinary
grant
of
the
authority
to
impose
retroactive
liability.
the
grant
exists
nowhere
other
than
in
the
same
sentence
that
says
shall.
i
think
that's
quite
different
than
saying,
epa,
in
2
years
issue
clean
air
regulations.
that's...
that's
a
different
case.
and
pierce
county
is
quite
different.
i
think
the
government
probably
has
inherent
authority
to
recover
misspent
funds.
the
harm
is
the
same
harm
that
comes
from
disregarding
any
kind
of
deadline.
as
i
said,
this
is
the
sort
of
project
you
can
spend
20
years
on
and
always
come
up
with
a
more
perfect
assignment.
congress
knew
that.
they
knew
that
a
significant
amount
of
work
was
involved.
they
had
to
go
and
set
up
an
interim
funding
system
for
february
to
october
to
give
the
commissioner
time.
the
commissioner
came
back
and
said,
we've
done
it.
we've
completed
the
project.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
of
course.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
sure.
well,
it's
the
same
concern
the
court
noted
last
term
in
the
sigmon
coal
case.
the
coal
industry
is
characterized
by
a
significant
amount
of
transactions,
mergers,
acquisitions.
you
could
be
looking
at
acquiring
the
coal
company,
and
of
course,
given
the
nature
of
the
industry,
the
first
question
you
ask
is
what
is
your
liability,
and
they're
going
to
say,
well,
it's
this
much.
and
then
you...
then
the...
the
merger
or
the
acquisition
takes
place,
and
then
you
get
another
notice,
here
are,
you
know,
40
new
miners.
and
now,
all
of
a
sudden,
it's
this
much.
that
was
a
significant
concern
in
sigmon
coal,
and
it
is
significant
in
this
instance
as
well.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
interest
is
a
significant
factor
just
the
way
the
interest
rates
have
been
over
this
time
period.
it
certainly
doesn't
do
much
to
cushion
the
unfairness
and
inequity
of
getting
a
bill
retroactive
as
much
as
5
years.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the...
the
interest
is
apparently
not...
not
charged.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the...
the
key
factor
that
such
transactions
play
in
this
particular
industry
may
well
explain
why
you
don't
see
any
companies
on
this
side
of
the
case.
i
think
it's
always
wise
to
be
skeptical
of
fairness
arguments
that
are
raised
by
proxy.
there
are
no
companies
complaining
about,
oh,
we're
going
to
end
up
potentially
paying
a
higher
pro
rata
assessment
than
otherwise
because...
a
number
of
reasons.
again,
congress
cushioned
the
unfairness;
they
recognized
it
by
making
the
aml
fund
available.
second
of
all,
this
is
a
statute
that
is
suffused
with
concepts
of
rough
justice.
it
is
not
necessarily
a
more
perfect
result
to
pursue
5
years
instead
of
1
year
to
pay
for
your
own
principle.
that
does
not
necessarily
lead
to
a
more
perfect
result.
it
may
mean
that
more
companies
who
employed
miners
for
2
years
are
paying
over
all
of
those
benefits
than
companies...
when
companies
who
employed
the
same
miner
for
20
years
don't
have
to
pay
for
any.
but
the
critical--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
we
think
that
helps
us,
of
course,
because
it's
an
express
provision
for
an
assignment
after
october
1st.
there
are
no
other
such
provisions
and
because--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
reassignment
provisions,
yes.
now,
i'm
not
aware
of
a
situation
where
it's
reassigned
to
someone
who
never
had
any
assignments--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
right.
but
the
other
point
is
that
although
there's
a
provision
for--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oh,
no.
it
means
as
of
october
1st.
what
i'm
saying,
in
the
case
of
a
reassignment,
they
say
you
can
go
back
and...
and
reassign
it.
the
applicable
percentage
is
based
on
the
assignments
a
particular
company
had
as
of
october
1st.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
there's--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
there's
a
specific
exception
that
allows
reassignments.
there's
no
exception
for
reassignments.
and,
i
would
point
out,
there
is
no
provision
that
allows
changes
in
the
case
of
an
unassigned
miner,
and
that
is
what
has
been
going
on
here
primarily.
the
commissioner
has
been
revisiting
the
unassigned
pool,
and
that's
why
this
is
quite
different
from
a
lot
of
the
other
deadline
cases.
this
is...
we
think
the
commissioner
did
get
the
job
done
on
time.
she
just
wants
to
do
a
different
job.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
part
of
it.
and
the
one
thing
congress
did
not
do,
with
being
told,
you
know,
we're
coming
up
with
the
deadline,
they
didn't
change
the
deadline.
they
kept
that
in
place.
look
at
what
the
solicitor--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
before.
in
june
i
believe.
it
was
asked
for
in
february,
made
in
june
or
early
july.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
commissioner
did
get
the
work
done
on
time.
it's
just
she
just
wants
to
do
a
more
perfect
job.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
it's
reasonable
for
congress
to
determine
we
don't
need
the
more
perfect
job.
we
need
a
good-enough
job.
and
this
job
is
good
enough
to
get
the
fund
launched.
the
one
thing
that's
clear
is
that
the
way
the
petitioners
read
the
statute,
if
that
had
been
proposed
when
the
coal
act
was...
was
enacted,
it
never
would
have
gotten
off
the
ground.
the
idea
of
giving
the
commissioner
significant
discretion
on
an
open-ended
timetable
was
certainly
not
in
the
cards.
this
was
the
legislative
equivalent
of
trench
warfare,
parties
fighting
over
every
inch.
they
had
the
black
lung
model
which
did
give
the
secretary
of
labor
significant
discretion
in
allocating
responsibility
for
that
consequence
of...
of
the...
of
coal
mining,
and
they
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
it.
that's
why--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
we
know
it
primarily...
no.
there's
no
statement
like
that.
i
think
we
know
it
from
the
structure
of
the
statute
which
is
carefully
reticulated.
there
is
no
delegation
of
discretion
to
the
commissioner.
the
compromises
in
the
statute
are
spelled
out.
and
when
you
talk
about
revisiting
fairness,
keep
in
mind
you're
looking
at
one
particular
provision
and
you
say,
well,
that
looks
unfair.
it
may
be
because
another
provision
that's
not
at
issue
balances
that
out.
this
is,
as
the
court
noted
in
sigmon,
an
instance
of
legislative
horse
trading
and
log
rolling,
and
they're
setting
up
a
system
and
everybody
has
to
pitch
in
some.
the
older
pension
funds
pitched
in
some.
the
operators
pitched
in.
congress
came
forward
with
the
aml
fund,
and
it
moved
forward.
and
it
had
to
be
in
place
by
october
1st
or
the
wheels
would
have
fallen
off.
this
is
not
a
deadline
of
the
sort
you've
got
120
days
to
issue
a
decision.
thank
you,
your
honor.
