chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
happens
to
someone
who
wasn't
assigned
before
october
1st?
they're...
they're
not
just
left
out
in
the
cold,
are
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you...
you
say
congress
is
legislating
in
light
of
our
decision
in
pierce
county.
you're...
you're
just
applying
the
general
presumption
that
congress
does
that?
certainly
there's...
is
there
any
indication
here
that
congress
was
legislating
in
light
of
pierce
county?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
is...
this
is
quite
different
than
pierce
county,
though,
at
least
certainly
on
its
facts.
there
you
had
a
provision
that
the...
you're
supposed
to
ferret
out
some
sort
of
misappropriations
and
saying
that
the
inspector
general,
whoever
it
was,
was
supposed
to
do
it
in
4
months.
that's
simply
a
message
to
the
agency
to
get
going.
and
we...
i
think
we
said
quite
properly
that
didn't
mean
that
you
couldn't
ferret
out
this
sort
of
thing
after
the
4
months.
but
this
thing
has...
has
somewhat
different
ramifications,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mcdowell.
mr.
buscemi,

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
exactly
is
the
interest
of
the
trustees
that
you
represent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
a
fairly...
what
is
their
financial
or
pecuniary
interest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
buscemi.
