ms.
mcdowell,
there...
there
is
a
section,
9704(f)(2)(b),
that
deals
with
annual
adjustment
of
unassigned
premiums.
and
it
says
that
if
there's
an
assigned
miner
and
the
operator
goes
out
of
business
in
any
given
year,
then
that
assigned
miner
becomes
part
of
the
pool.
and
it
doesn't
matter
really
whether
the
initial
assignment
was
before
the
october
1
deadline
or
not.
they
just
go
into
the
pool
in
time.
and
that
seems
to
work
somewhat
against
your
interpretation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
does
show
at
least
that
much,
that
congress
didn't
want
to
continue
perpetually
to
adjust
these
things
for
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
it
possible
that
that
deadline
was
some
kind
of
political
compromise,
so
to
speak,
at
the
time
it
was
passed
and
the
operators
thought,
well,
that's
it?
you
know,
after
that
deadline,
it's
fixed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
would
you
explain
to
us
the
real
world
consequences
at
the
end
of
the
day
for
the
respective
positions
of
the
parties?
apparently
the
miners
will
be
covered
one
way
or
another.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
backwards
looking
assessment--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
those
early
years.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
much
are
we
talking
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
