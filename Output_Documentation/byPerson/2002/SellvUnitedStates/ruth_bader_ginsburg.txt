do
you...
do
you
equate
it
to
bail,
bail
pending
trial?
if
it's
denied,
and
the
trial
goes
on,
you
can't
get
it
back
again
once
the
trial
is
over.
is...
is
that
your
point,
with
respect
to
once...
once
he's
drugged
he
can't
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--restored?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you're
going
to
brief
this
issue,
so
perhaps
we
ought
to,
since
your
time
is
running
out,
hear
something
on
the
merits
of
your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happens
to
him?
you
can't
keep
him
in
prison
indefinitely.
i
had
very
much
the
same
question
in
mind.
as
i
understand
it,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
he
could
not
be
civilly
committed,
since
he's
been
found
nondangerous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
he
were
found
dangerous,
he
could
be
civilly
committed.
so
here
he
is,
nondangerous,
but
incompetent
to
stand
trial.
you...
you
agree
that
civil
commitment
was...
isn't...
isn't
available
under
those
circumstances?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
thought
that
the
whole
reason
why
we're...
how
you
got
to
this
stage
is
that
a
district
court
made
a
finding
that
this
man
is
not
a
danger
to
himself
or
others,
and
now
you
want
to
say
for
purposes
of
the...
your
being
here
on
that
question,
could
he
be
medicated,
because
he's
not
a
danger
to
himself
or
others,
that
finding
holds,
but
once
he
avoids
the
trial,
then
he
can
say,
ah,
but
for
purposes
of
civil
commitment
i
am
dangerous
to
myself
or
others?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
can
you
back
up
just
for
a
minute,
because
there's
a
piece
of
this
that
i'm
not
clear
on.
i
thought
that
before
the
issue
of
competence
to
stand
trial
came
up,
the
bureau
of
prisons
had
determined
this
man
to
be
dangerous
to
himself
or
others
without
medication,
and
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
was
going
to
medicate
him
under
the
danger
standard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
get
your
answer
to
the
question
that
justice
scalia
asked
mr.
short?
that
is,
suppose
it
is
determined
that
he
can't
be
medicated
for
the
purpose
of
making
him
competent,
what
happens
to
him?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
isn't
there
something
short
of
that,
though?
i
mean,
we...
we
are
told
that
there
are
the
old
kind
of
drugs
that
could
be
injected,
and
the
new
drugs,
which
originally
had
to
be
taken
orally.
isn't...
that
distinction
between
the
category
of
drugs,
not
the
particular
drug
within
that
category,
or
even
a
decision
between
something
that's
injectable
and
something
that
we'd
have
to
force
him
to
swallow,
isn't...
isn't
that
kind
of
determination
something
that
the...
shouldn't...
shouldn't
there
be
some
control
over
the
government's
discretion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
just
asking
the
government
to
identify
that
general
class
of
drugs,
not
the
court
making
the
decision
in
the
first
instance.
