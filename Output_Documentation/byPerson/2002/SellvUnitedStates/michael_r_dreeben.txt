mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
the
question
of
jurisdiction
first.
dr.
sell's
claim
should
be
analyzed
as
having
two
related
but
distinct
components.
one
component
of
his
claim
is
a
harper-style
objection
to
forcible
medication
by
the
government
in
order
to
render
him
competent
to
stand
trial.
the
second
component
of
his
claim
is
a
riggins-style
objection
to
the
fairness
of
his
trial
if,
in
fact,
he
is
medicated
and
restored
to
competence
and
tried.
the
riggins-style
claim
is
clearly
not
amenable
to
review
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
dr.
sell
has
not
even
been
tried.
there
is
clearly
no
determination
yet
whether
he
can
be
given
a
fair
trial,
whether
he
will
receive
one,
and
he
may
raise
an
objection
to
the
fairness
of
his
trial
at
the
conclusion
of
the
criminal
case
and
obtain
reversal
of
his
conviction
at
that
time,
but
the
harper-style
claim
is
amenable
to
review
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
it
deals
with
a
right
that
is
effectively
unreviewable
if
not
reviewed
now,
just
as
this
court's
cases
addressing
double
jeopardy
claims
and
qualified
immunity
claims
are
effectively
unreviewable
if
not
reviewed--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
right
would
be
lost
if
the
trial
occurs.
here,
one
of
his
claims
is
a
right
not
to
be
medicated.
that
right
will
be
lost
if,
in
fact,
he
is
medicated.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that's
right
and
that's
because
the
court
has
concluded
that
there
is
no
right
not
to
be
tried
in
the
relevant
sense
without
particular
evidence
that
will
be
suppressed.
what
that
reflects
is
a
right
whose
remedy
would
be
a
right
not
to
have
the
evidence
used
against
them,
which
could
include
reversal
of
a
conviction,
so
that
kind
of
a
claim
is
reviewable
at
the
end
of
the
case.
but
taking
dr.
sell's
claims
at
face
value,
he's
saying
it
will
violate
my
first
amendment
rights
and
my
substantive
due
process
rights
to
be
medicated,
and
those
claims
are,
in
a
sense,
independent
of
the
main
criminal
action.
justice
scalia
is
correct
that
in
a
sense
they
could
be
viewed
as
claims
that
could
be
brought
independently,
but
i
think
under
the
statutory
scheme
that
exists
they
are
better
brought
in
the
context
of
the
criminal
case,
rather
than
through
an
independent
apa
action
or
some
other
form
of
action.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
i'm
a
little
bit
less
concerned
about
the
practical
consequences,
although
i
share
the
view
that
the
delay
of
the
criminal
case
and,
more
importantly,
concretely
here,
the
delay
in
starting
the
medication
is
a
critical
problem
that
results
from
collateral
order
review,
but
there
are
two
things
that
i
think
reduce
any
of
the
costs
associated
with
permitting
collateral
order
review.
first,
if
this
court
does
settle
the
fundamental
question
in
favor
of
the
government
and
determines
that,
on
an
appropriate
showing
that
this
court
defines,
medication
for
the
purpose
of
restoring
competence
is
permissible,
in
the
future,
criminal
defendants
will
not
be
able
to
assert
that
broad,
unsettled,
and
important
legal
issue
and
obtain
a
stay
of
the
medication
order
in
order
to
litigate
it.
what
they
would
have
to
show
is
that
the
actual
application
of
those
standards
to
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
is
incorrect.
that
will
most
likely
be
reviewed
under
a
more
deferential
standard.
courts
of
appeals
can
establish
expedited
calendars
to
dispose
of
frivolous
claims,
and
can
weed
out
those
claims
that
don't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
would
be
a
new
exception
as
applied
to
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
but
the
standards
of
the
collateral
order
doctrine
i
think
are
met,
and
there
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
o'connor,
i
do
think
that
a
heightened
form
of
review
is
appropriate.
i
don't
have
any
case
that
has
precisely
articulated
the
correct
standard
of
review,
but
in
all
of
this
court's
substantive
due
process
cases,
what
the
court
has
done
is
balanced
the
interests
of
the
individual
in
his
liberty,
or
in
this
case
in
the
first
amendment
concerns,
against
the
government's
interest
in
achieving
the
objectives
that
it
has.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
order
to
render
the
defendant
competent
to
stand
trial,
your
honor,
the
government
would
have
to
have
some
sort
of
a
finding
that
would
justify--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
that
that
makes
any
difference
at
all,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
government's
authority
here
is
the...
derives
from
the
fact
that
dr.
sell
has
been
indicted
on
serious
criminal
charges,
and
he
has
been...
been
found
incompetent
to
stand
trial
on
those
charges.
the
government
will
be
completely
unable
to
achieve
what
this
court
has
recognized
to
be
the
compelling
interest
in
adjudicating
serious
criminal
charges.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
the
same
due
process
question
as
presented
here,
justice
kennedy,
with
the
possible
difference
that
our
interests
may
be
greater
with
respect
to
a
person
who
has
been
charged
than
with
respect
to
a
person
who
has
not.
material
witnesses
are
held
all
the
time
without
bail.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
authority
would
be
an
application
of
any
principle
that
this
court
adopts
in
this
case
to
permit
us
to
medicate
the
defendant.
as
i
indicated,
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
witness
and
a
defendant,
but
here
we
deal
with
someone
who
has
already
been
placed
under
indictment,
which
is
to
an...
a
certain
extent
a
significant
restriction
on
liberty
as
well
as
an
indication
of
a
paramount
government
interest
in
adjudicating
the
charges.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
maybe
it's
important
to
back
up
and
look
at
how
this
case
came
to
be
before
the
court.
dr.
sell
was
found
to
be
incompetent
to
stand
trial,
and
pursuant
to
statute
section
4241(d)
of
title
18,
he
was
committed
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
for
treatment
to
determine
whether
his
competency
could
be
restored.
in
the
context
of
that
confinement
at
a
medical
facility,
pursuant
to
regulations
of
the
bureau
of
prisons,
the
bureau
of
prisons
determined
that
antipsychotic
medication
and
nothing
else
was
the
means
by
which
the
government
could
restore
him
to
competency.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
the
regulations
do
indeed
address
the
potential
of
medication
for
the
purpose
of
rendering
competence
to
stand
trial.
that's
one
of
the
criteria
that
is
given
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
when
it
accepts
a
patient
for
treatment
under
section
4241(d),
and
the
bureau
in
fact
made
the
finding
that
this
was
a
medically
appropriate
treatment
for
a
person
who
has
the
illness,
the
serious
delusional
disorder
that
dr.
sell
has,
and
that
this
treatment
had
a
substantial
probability
of
restoring
him
to
competence.
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
administrative
order,
and
it's
the
same
administrative
order
that
i
referred
to
in
answering
justice
kennedy's
question,
justice
ginsburg,
does
rest
on
both
restoration
of
competency
and
to
a
certain
extent
on
concerns
about
danger.
what
happened
after
the
bureau
of
prisons
entered
that
order
is
not
that
it
immediately
implemented
it
and
began
to
medicate
dr.
sell.
rather,
it
stayed
the
order,
and
dr.
sell
then
sought
judicial
review
in
the
very
court
that
had
ordered
his
commitment,
which
is
why
i
think
that
it
was
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
hear
this
in
the
criminal
action
rather
than
under
some
separate
apa
action.
this
is
the
district
court
that
had
ordered
dr.
sell
confined.
the
magistrate
judge
determined
that
the
government
had
not
made
a
showing
of
dangerousness,
which
would
have
permitted
medication
under
washington
v.
harper,
but
that
it
had
adequately
shown
that
medication
was
necessary
in
order
to
restore
dr.
sell
to
be
competent
for
trial.
dr.
sell
then
appealed
that
determination
to
the
district
court,
which
entered
its
final
decision
saying
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
could
medicate,
there
was
a
substantial
probability
of
restoring
competence,
the
antipsychotic
medication
was
medically
appropriate
treatment
for
the
psychotic
illness
that
dr.
sell
had,
and
that
there
was
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
a
fair
trial,
and
any
particularized
fair
trial
concerns
that
dr.
sell
was
raising,
involving
effects
on
his
demeanor,
or
his
effects
to
relate
to
counsel,
should
be
determined
after
the
medication
has
been
administered
and
it's
been
determined
whether,
in
fact,
he
was
restored
to
competence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
at
that
point,
mr.
short
is
correct
that
under
4241
he
would
then
be
referred
over
to
the
director
of
a
medical
facility
where
he
would
be
held
for
confinement
to
determine,
pursuant
to
section
4246,
whether,
if
released,
he
would
be
dangerous
to
himself
or
others.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
is
not
something
that
courts
of
appeals
that
i
have
seen
have
had
to
deal
with,
and
this
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
it's
a
very
particularized
inquiry
under
the
sub--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
the
question
of
what
would
happen
if
dr.
sell
were
living
safely
in
free
society
is
obviously
distinct
from
this
case.
there's
no
authority--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
had
taken
justice
breyer's
question
to
involve
somebody
who's
at
liberty
but
not
charged
with
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes
to
both.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i...
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
question
that
you're
asking
is,
how
serious
need
the
offense
be
in
order
to
justify
an
intrusion
on
substantive
due
process
interests,
whether
they
be
through
psychiatric
medication
or
through
blood
pressure--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
i
entirely
agree
that
it
needs
to
be
a
sufficiently
serious
offense
to
outweigh--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
to
the
extent
that
a
person
was
making
a
claim
that,
i'm
not
medically
competent
to
go
to
trial
because
i
have
high
blood
pressure,
and
if
i
go
to
trial,
i
may
have
a
heart
attack
and
die.
this
actually
happens.
people
will
come
into
court
and
say,
you
can't
try
me
now
because
i'm
too
fragile,
i
have
a
serious
health
condition,
and
courts
then
have
to
balance.
it's
essentially
the
same
balancing
test
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
they
have
to
balance--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
may
be,
justice
stevens,
relevant
to
the
analysis
to
the
extent
that
courts
have
held
that
the
amount
of
time
that
a
person
can
be
held
for
treatment
under
4241(d)
cannot
exceed
the
ultimate
sentence
that
they
would
receive.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
it's
not
true
in
this
case
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
even
limiting
consideration
to
the
medicaid
fraud
and
money
laundering
charges,
the
test
is
the
maximum
sentence
that
the
defendant
could
receive
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law,
and
he
could
receive
a
sentence--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
this
court
obviously
hasn't
addressed
the
question,
and
it
would
be
free
to
weigh
in--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
it
probably
is.
of
course,
he's
also
charged
with
attempted
murder
and
conspiracy
to
murder
charges.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
to
be--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--you're
right,
justice
stevens,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
question
is,
how
long
can
the
government
hold
him
for
treatment,
he's
clearly
indicted
for
attempted
murder
and
conspiracy
to
murder
charges,
and
the
length
that
the
government
can
hold--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
because
the
government's
position
here
is
that
any
felony
case
is
serious
enough--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
again,
if...
if
a
court
were
to
hold...
it's
not
critical
to
my
position,
because
my
position
is,
it's
statutory
maximum.
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
we're
not
going
to
look
at
the
attempted
murder
and
conspiracy
murder
charges,
we
are
only
going
to
look
at
the
sentencing
guidelines
sentence,
and
we
are
going
to
hold
that
he
cannot
be
held
for
treatment
longer
than
his
ultimate
potential
sentence,
then
the
court
would
have
no
choice
but
to
remand
for
treatment
of
dr.
sell
under
4246
to
determine
whether
he
should
be
civilly
committed.
those
are
questions
that
were
never
litigated
in
any
court,
and
are
certainly
not
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
what
is
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
whether
treatment
to
render
a
defendant
competent
to
stand
trial
on
a
nonviolent
offense
is
a
sufficient
government
interest.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
has
not
been
getting
antipsychotic
medication.
he
gets--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--essentially,
no,
and
the
reason
is
that
there
is
no
other
form
of
treatment,
standing
alone,
that
would
have
any
likelihood
of
success
with
a
person
with
delusional
disorder,
persecutory
type.
this
is
a
serious
thought
disorder,
interfering
with
dr.
sell's
ability
to
rationally
understand
what
is
going
on
in
the
world,
and
it's
well-established
in
the
medical
literature
that
antipsychotic
medication
and
nothing
else
is
the
only
thing
that
may
hold
promise
of
treating
the...
the
ailment
that
he
has.
now,
the...
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i...
justice
souter,
if
a
court
were
to
attempt
to
make
an
order
drug-specific
for
a
patient
it
would
be
essentially
ignoring
the
medical
reality
of
what
this
treatment
will
entail.
now,
dr.
wolfson,
the
treating
psychiatrist,
or
consulting
psychiatrist
at
the
hearing,
testified
that
in
his
view
there
were
two
particular
medications,
quetiapine
and
olanzapine,
which
were
likely
to
be
the
most
suitable
ones
for
dr.
sell's
case
because
of
their
very
minimal
side
effect
profile,
that
they
would
have
a
much
better
chance
of
not
inducing
sedation
or
other
side
effects
that
he
might
claim
would
interfere
with
the
fairness
of
his
trial.
but
he
explained
that
he
did
not
want
to
be
locked
into
a
particular
medication
because
one
of
his
hopes,
as
the
psychiatrist
on
the
case,
is
that
dr.
sell
would
participate
in
choosing,
if
he
had
been
told,
he's
ordered
to
take
medication,
which
medication
he
wanted
to
take.
this
is
the
kind
of
interactive
process
that
doctors
and
patients
have
all
the
time,
and
for
a
court
to
superimpose
some
rigid
rule
up
front
that
establishes
this
and
only
this
medication
can
be
administered
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i...
i
think
the
court
should
be
very
cautious
about
superimposing
a
judicial
decision
making
process
on
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the...
the
problem
with
that,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
response
that
an
individual
patient
has
to
a
drug
is
individual-specific.
side
effects
can
be
described
in
general
categories,
but
nobody
knows
what
side
effects
will
actually
occur,
or
whether
the
drugs
will
be
effective
until
they've
been
administered,
and
it
is
not
uncommon
for
the
treating
psychiatrist
to
discover
that
a
drug
that
may
have
a
wildly,
you
know,
significant
side
effect
in
one
individual
has
none
in
another,
and
a
drug
that's
anticipated
to
be
entirely
successful
turns
out
not
to
be
successful.
one
of
the
newer,
new
generation
of
drugs,
the
atypical
drugs
that
have
the
more
favorable
side
effect
profiles
in
general
may
not
turn
out
to
be
suitable
for
a
particular
patient.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
would...
might
be
true,
justice
souter,
if
the
government's
alternatives
were
antipsychotic
medication
and
psychosurgery,
so
that
the
difference
was
dramatic
between
the
two
forms
of
treatment
that
are
being
proposed,
but
even
looking
at
the,
at
the
classes
of
drugs
that
are
at
issue
here,
the
atypical
drugs
and
the
older
generation
of
typical
antipsychotic
drugs,
there
are
very
important
and
dramatic
differences
between
them,
but
they
belong
to
a
family
of
medications
that
are
used
for
treatment
all
the
time,
and
the
psychiatrist's
understanding
of
the
various
range
of
effects
that
might
be
achieved
is
not
likely
to
be
enhanced
by
subjecting
that
to
judicial
review,
nor
are
the
potential
side
effects
so
dramatically
different
that
it
calls
for
an
entirely
different
substantive
due
process
analysis.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
is
legislation
that
authorizes
and
requires
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
treat
an
individual
to
attempt
to
restore
him
to
competency
once
he
has
been
determined
incompetent.
that's
what
section
4241(d)
says.
now,
it
does
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct,
and
it
does
not
specifically
refer
to
antipsychotic
medication,
but
in
1984,
when
this
legislation
was
enacted,
it
was
well
known
that,
for
the
kind
of
psychotic
conditions
that
render
a
defendant
incompetent
to
stand
trial,
it's
antipsychotic
medication
or--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--you
know,
justice
kennedy,
i'll
answer
that
question
yes,
but
i
recognize
that
it
involves
a
very
different
set
of
considerations,
because
the
intrusion
through
force
feeding
of
somebody
who
wants
to
die
might
be
considered
to
be
a
very
different
decision
than
treating
an
ill
person's
illness
with
medication
that
is
the
norm
that's
used
to
treat
people
with
these
kinds
of
disorders.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
as
a
matter
of
the
organization
of
government,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
ability
to
resolve
criminal
charges
through
the
mechanism
of
a
trial
is
a
compelling
interest
in
maintaining
social
order
and
peace,
and
in
order
to
try
these
criminal
charges,
the
government
has
no
option
but
to
attempt
to
restore
competency.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it...
it's
quite
clear
that
the
government
may
seize
the
person
and
hold
them
in
pretrial
detention,
which
is
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--not
that
this
court
has
considered,
but
this...
this
kind
of
medication
has
to
be
judged
against
the
backdrop
of
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
and
the
efficacy
of
the
treatment
for
those
people
who
have
this
kind
of
disorder.
virtually
everyone
who
is
committed
to
the
bureau
of
prisons'
care
for
incompetency
determinations
has
some
form
of
psychotic
disorder
that
can
be
treated.
there
are,
of
course,
organic
problems
that
cannot
be
treatable
at
all,
and
there
are
other
kinds
of
mental
illness
that
can
create
this,
but
the
statistics
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
furnished
to
us
in
considering
this
case
shows
that
80
percent
of
the
individuals
who
are
committed
take
these
drugs
voluntarily.
of
the
remaining
20
percent
who
did
not,
there's
a
very
real
indication
that
any
sort
of
judicial
relief
has
been
sought
through
appellate
review,
and
i
think
that's
because
these
drugs
enable
someone
who
has
serious
psychotic
orders
to
be
restored
to
a
point
of
rationality
where
they
can
make
decisions
about
what
they
want
to
do
with
their
life.
so
instead
of
remaining
incompetent
and
perhaps
being
committed
indefinitely
to
a
bureau
of
prisons
facility,
where
they
may
be
warehoused
without
any
treatment,
or
being
released
if
they
are
not
subject
to
civil
commitment,
so
that
they
don't
stand
trial
on
criminal
charges
and
suffer
essentially
no
consequences,
most
individuals
accept
the
fact,
particularly
after
an
initial
round
of
treatment
has
rendered
them
competent
so
that
thy
can
understand
the
benefits
of
this,
that
the
medication
is
the
appropriate,
medically
sanctioned
way
to
deal
with
the
disease
that
they
have.
and
when
the
government
has
no
mechanism
to
achieve
its
essential
interest
in
adjudicating
criminal
charges
but
for
using
these
medically
appropriate
means,
and
it
can
show
the,
the
items
that
have
been
laid
out
in
our
brief
of
medical
appropriateness,
no
less-restrictive
alternative,
and
that
there's
a
reason
to
expect
that
a
fair
trial
will
not
be
precluded,
the
government
should
appropriately
have
the
authority
to
override
the
substantive
due
process
interest
that
the
defendant
has
asserted
and
medicate
him.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
it
would,
justice
stevens.
