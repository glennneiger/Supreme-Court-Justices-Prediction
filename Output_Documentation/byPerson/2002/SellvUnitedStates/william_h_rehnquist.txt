we'll

argument
now

charles
thomas
sell
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
short.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
trial
has
taken
place?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
held
that
in
riggins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
perfectly
true,
but
i
think
the
hypothesis
offered
by
justice
scalia,
at
least
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
even
if
that's
the
case,
perhaps
he
has
to
wait
till
the
end
of
the
criminal
trial
in
order
to
appeal
it
because
our
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals
in
criminal
cases
has
been
so
strict.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
he's
nondangerous.
he
was
later
charged
with
attempted
murder,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
don't
even
agree
with
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
below
who
said
there
could
be
forcible
medication
for
a
violent
crime?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
wish
to
reserve
your
remaining
time,
mr.
short?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
now,
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
not
just
they're
unreviewable,
mr.
dreeben,
but
it
would...
i
think
we
said
in
those
cases
there
the
claim
was
a
right
not
to
be
tried.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
to
be
tried
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if...
what
if...
what
if
someone
says,
i
claim
a
right
to
be
tried
without
this
evidence
that
i
want
suppressed
but
the
court
has
ruled
otherwise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is...
what
is
the
basis
for
the
government
ordering
medication
in
the
case
of
high
blood
pressure,
where...
where
i
would
think
it
doesn't
necessarily
interfere
with
your
ability
to
make
trial
decisions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
short,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
short.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-5644
sell
againts
united
states
will
be
announce
by
justice
breyer.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
constitution
permits
the
government
to
administer
antipsychotic
drugs
involuntarily
to
a
mentally
ill
criminal
defendant,
in
order
to
render
that
defendant
competent
to
stand
trial
for
serious
but
non-violent
crimes.
in
two
previous
cases,
washington
v.
harper
and
riggins
versus
nevada,
this
court
has
said
that
an
indivudual
has
a
significant
constitutionally
protected
liberty
interest
in
avoiding
the
unwanted
administration
of
antipsychotic
drugs.
the
court
added
that
the
government
may
nonetheless
involuntarily
administer
antipsychotic
drugs
for
the
sake
of
the
individuals
own
safety
or
the
safety
of
others.
that
was
really
harper,
and
the
court
indicated
that
the
government
also
could
administer
similar
drugs
similary
when
necessary
to
allow
the
adjudication
of
a
serious
criminal
charge,
it
was
murder,
in
that
case.
we
now
hold
that
the
constituion
does
permit
the
government
to
administer
drugs
involuntarily
in
order
to
render
a
mentally
ill
individual
competent
to
stand
trial
for
serious
crime
provided
that
the
government
satisfies
certain
important
conditions.
conditons
which
we
recognize,
may
limit
involuntary
medication
fot
trial
competence
purposes
to
rare
instances.
we
set
forth
those
conditons
in
the
opinion.
i
can
summarize
them
as
follows:
first,
a
court
must
find
that
in
the
indivudual
circumstances,
important
goverment
interests
are
at
stake.
the
need
to
prosecute
serious
criminal
charges
whether
involving
a
crime
against
the
person
or
a
crime
against
property
may
count
as
an
important
government
interest.
so
too,
does
the
goverment
have
the
concomitant
constitutionally
essential
interest
in
assuring
that
the
defendant's
trial
is
fair.
second,
the
court
must
conclude
that
involuntary
medication
will
significantly
further
both
of
those
governmental
interests,
making
it
substantially
likely
that
the
defendant
will
be
able
to
stand
trial
and
substantially
unlikely
that
side
effects
will
render
the
trial
unfair.
third,
a
court
must
conclude
the
involuntary
medication
is
necessary,
to
further
those
interests
there
must
be
no
less
intrusive
alternative
that
would
likely
achieve
substantially
the
same
results.
fourth,
the
court
must
conclude
the
administation
of
the
drugs
is
medically
appropriate
i.e.
in
the
patient's
best
medical
interest
in
light
of
his
medical
condition,
the
specific
kinds
of
drugs
at
issue,
they
will
map.
finally,
a
court
asked
to
approve
involuntary
admistration
of
drugs
for
trial
competence
purposes
should
ordinarily
determine
whether
the
government
first
has
thought
to
administer
those
drugs
for
other
purposes
namely,
purposes
related
to
an
individual's
dangerousness
or
the
need
to
avoid
a
grave
risk
to
that
individual's
health.
considering
these
other
more
traditional
purposes
first
is
important,
if
drugs
are
authorized
for
these
other
reasons
the
problem
of
authorization
for
trial
competence
reasons
disappears.
if
drugs
are
not
authorized
for
these
other
reasons,
then
the
medical
experts
in
courts
can
focus
on
the
critically
important
questions
such
as
"why
is
it
necessary
and
medically
appropriate
forcibly
to
administer
drugs
to
an
individual
who
is
not
dangerous
and
who
is
medically
competent
to
make
up
his
own
mind
about
medical
treatment?".
having
such
standards
we
apply
them
to
the
case
before,
we
mention
that
there
are
strong
reasons
to
believe
that
forced
medication
in
the
case
before
us
might
have
been
justified
on
these
other
reasons,
on
dangerousness
grounds,
but
given
the
legal
posture
of
the
case,
we
are
required
to
assume
that
that
is
not
so.
making
that
assumption,
we
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
take
for
full
account
of
the
standards
that
i
have
just
summarized.
we
consequently
vacate
its
judgment
and
remand
the
case
specifying
if
they
do
it
again
they
should
do
it
on
a
basis
of
current
conditions
not
what
conditons
were
at
the
time
that
the
case
got
started.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
o'conner
and
thomas
have
joined.
