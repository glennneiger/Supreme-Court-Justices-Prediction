mr.
barry
a.
short
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
friday,
this
court
entered
its
order
stating
that
counsel
should
be
prepared
to
discuss
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
cited
the
cohen
v.
beneficial
case.
mr.
barry
a.
short
it
did
not
come
up
in
the
court
of
appeals,
justice
o'connor.
in
the
first--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--it's
a
decision
from...
it's
a
final
decision
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
mr.
barry
a.
short
that's
the
issue,
i
believe,
yes.
mr.
barry
a.
short
no
trial
has
taken
place,
not
at
all.
i...
i
believe
that
this
court,
of
course,
has
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
section
1254
because
it
granted
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
section
1291,
providing
for
appeal
of
final
decisions
of
the
district
courts.
i
believe
this
was
a
final
decision
pursuant
to
the
cohen
collateral
final
order
doctrine.
now,
while
this
court
has
not
addressed
the
collateral
order
doctrine
under
these
set
of
facts,
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have,
have
unanimously
concluded
that
an
order
approving
the
involuntary
medication
of
a
pretrial
detainee
constitutes
an
appealable
order
under
cohen,
and
these
cases
are
set
forth
in
footnote
5,
page
10
of
the
government's
brief.
in
order
to
fall
within
the
collateral
order
doctrine,
the
order
must
satisfy
several
requirements.
it
must
conclusively
determine
the
dispute
question,
it
must
resolve
an
important
issue
completely
and
separate
from
the
merits
of
the
underlying
action,
and
it
must
be
effectively
unreviewable
on
appeal
from
the
final
judgment.
mr.
barry
a.
short
except
by
that
time,
justice
o'connor,
his
rights
will
have
already
been
infringed.
he
will
not
be
able
to
become
unmedicated.
mr.
barry
a.
short
riggins...
riggins
was
looking
at
a
post
conviction
case,
however,
and
looking
only
to
see
if
his
trial
rights
had
been
violated.
mr.
barry
a.
short
i
would
say
on
all
three
it
would.
certainly
under...
under
the
first
and
the
fifth
amendments,
whatever
rights
he
would
have
would
have
been
infringed
irreparably
once
he's
medicated.
mr.
barry
a.
short
my
reflections
on
that,
justice
scalia,
is,
it
would
probably
be
too
late.
by
the
time
we
brought
any
type
of
other
action,
i
believe
the
government
would
have
proceeded
in
the
criminal
case
and
gone
ahead
with
the
order
and
had
him
medicated.
i
also
see
filing
such
an
action
with
another
district
court,
for
example,
having
it
defer
to
the
court
in
which
the
criminal
action
was
pending,
i
think
there's
some...
i
think
there's
some
procedural
problems
with,
by
the
time
that
was
done,
dr.
sell
may
have
already
been
medicated,
and
the
court's...
we
will
address
these
issues
hopefully
in
our
briefs
that
are
due,
that
are
due
friday.
mr.
barry
a.
short
yes,
sir.
mr.
barry
a.
short
again,
justice
scalia,
all
i
can
say
is,
i
think
by
the
time
that
would
be
reviewed,
filed,
and
considered,
i'm
afraid
dr.
sell
will
have
been
medicated,
and
again
we've
already,
of
course--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--i
do...
i
do
understand
that,
but...
and
again,
i
think
this
is
unreviewable.
mr.
barry
a.
short
once--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--it's
a
simple
statement,
but
once
he's
medicated
he
can't
be
unmedicated.
mr.
barry
a.
short
my
view,
justice
scalia,
is
it
can't
be
effectively
reviewed.
once
he's
medicated
with
these
drugs,
whatever
changes
take
place,
these
drugs
are
meant
to
cause
changes
to
take
place.
that's
the
purpose
of
giving
him
these
drugs.
in
effect,
the
decision
will
have
been
made,
his
mind
will
have
been
altered,
in
whatever
segment
that
is
altered,
and
that
cannot
be
undone.
mr.
barry
a.
short
justice
stevens,
that
is
correct.
mr.
barry
a.
short
yeah.
there
was
appeal...
there
was
an
appeal
of
that
order,
and
then
we
filed
a
motion
with
the
magistrate
judge
to
have
a
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not,
as
to
the
propriety
of
whether
or
not
he
should
be
medicated,
yes.
that's...
that's
the
procedural--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
barry
a.
short
he
was...
he
was
sent
to
the
springfield
medical
center
after
being
found
incompetent
under
section
4241,
in
order
to
be
treated
to
see
if
he
could
be
restored
to
competency.
mr.
barry
a.
short
very
well.
mr.
barry
a.
short
very
well.
the
individual,
of
course,
we
are
talking
about
today
is
charles
thomas
sell.
he's
a
dentist.
he
is
a
pretrial
detainee.
he
has
not
been
convicted
of
any
crime.
in
his
present
setting,
he
is
neither
dangerous
to
himself,
nor
is
he
dangerous
to
others.
the
government
wishes
to
medicate
dr.
sell.
mr.
barry
a.
short
yes,
it
is,
justice
o'connor.
the
district
court
made
that
finding,
and...
and...
essentially
reversing
the
magistrate
court,
and
the
appellate
court
affirmed
the
district
court's
finding
that
he
was
not
dangerous.
the
government
wants
to
forcibly
administer
to
dr.
sell
antipsychotic
drugs
solely
on
the
chance
that
it
can,
that
it
can
bring
him
to
trial
on
insurance
fraud
charges,
nonviolent
crimes.
dr.
sell
does
not
want
to
be
forcibly
medicated.
in
his
own
words,
he
said,
i
do
not
want
my
chemistry
altered.
my
brain
is
working
fine.
now,
dr.
sell
is
legally
incompetent.
he
suffers
from
a
rare
mental
disorder
called
delusional
disorder,
persecutory
type.
this
is
not
schizophrenia.
the
main
feature
of
this
disorder
is
nonbizarre
delusions.
in
other
words,
thoughts
that
are
plausible,
thoughts
that
can
conceivably
come
true,
probably
won't.
in
dr.
sell's
case,
he
believes
the
fbi
is
out
to
discredit
or
harm
him.
excuse
me.
mr.
barry
a.
short
justice
souter,
that's
absolutely
true.
mr.
barry
a.
short
that's
part
of...
that's
part
of
the
delusion.
but
another
feature
of
this
disorder
is
that
apart
from
the
direct
impact
of
the
delusions,
psychosocial
functioning
is
not
markedly,
markedly
impaired,
nor
is
the
behavior
odd,
which
means
that
his
disorder
only
affects
him
in
a
narrow,
a
very
narrow
band,
but
the
rest...
most
of
his
life
he
can
perform
as
a
normal
person
would,
function
in
a
normal
manner,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--the
problem--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--the
problem,
justice
scalia,
is,
because
of
his
delusion
he
can't
focus
on
the
trial--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--on
anything
else
other
than
the
fbi.
mr.
barry
a.
short
your
honor,
our...
because
we
feel
that
he
is
a)
medically
competent...
no
one
has
ever
contended
that
dr.
sell
is
not
medically
competent.
dr.
sell
is
perfectly
able
to
make
his
own
health
care
decisions,
and
make
his
own
decisions
about
his
mind
and
his
body,
and
he
has
made
the
decision--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--he's
legally
incompetent--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--yes,
but
he's
not
mentally
incompetent.
mr.
barry
a.
short
the
standard's
changed
somewhat,
but
the
answer
is
essentially
yes.
mr.
barry
a.
short
yes,
there
was
such
a
finding.
mr.
barry
a.
short
yes,
there
was--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--there
was--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--yes.
that
is...
that
is
my
position.
mr.
barry
a.
short
first
of
all,
since
he
is
medically
competent,
he
can
make
decisions
about
his
own
person
and
body.
mr.
barry
a.
short
well,
on
a...
at
a
basic
level
that
is,
that
is
what...
we
have
a...
we
have
a
nondangerous--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--this
is--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--this
is
very
different,
your
honor.
we
are
dealing
with
a
person
who
has
been
merely
accused
of
a
crime.
he
is
medically
competent.
he
is
nondangerous.
mr.
barry
a.
short
he
was
charged
with
that
offense,
yes.
mr.
barry
a.
short
no,
justice
breyer,
not
at
all.
the
nondangerousness--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--the
only...
the
only
times...
as
i
read
the
cases,
pretrial
detainees...
these
are
civilly
committed
people...
can
be
medically
administered
antipsychotic
drugs
is
if
they
are
in
the
prison
setting
and
they
are
dangerous
to
themselves--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--maybe
i...
maybe
i--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--maybe
i
misstated--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--our
view
is
that,
first
of
all
we
have
fundamental
rights
at
stake
here,
and
the
government
must
show
then,
of
course,
a
compelling
interest
in
overriding
those
fundamental
interests.
mr.
barry
a.
short
i'm
sorry.
maybe
i
misunderstood--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
requirements
of--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--oh,
i
have.
mr.
barry
a.
short
yes.
mr.
barry
a.
short
i
think
essentially
those
are
the
right
standards.
mr.
barry
a.
short
yes.
mr.
barry
a.
short
essentially--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--essentially
that's
it.
mr.
barry
a.
short
well,
it's
very
possible
then,
of
course,
i'm
not
understanding
justice
breyer's
contention,
and
it's
my
fault.
i
don't
concede
that
they
can
do
this
at
all.
mr.
barry
a.
short
i--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--i'm
sorry,
i
can't
recall
their
standards
with
such
preciseness
that
i
can
answer
that
question.
mr.
barry
a.
short
that
is
my
under...
that
is
my--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--that
is
our
position.
mr.
barry
a.
short
yes,
there
is
a
right
to
do
that.
mr.
barry
a.
short
the
intrusion
there
is
very
minimal,
and
i
think
the
government...
the
governmental
interest
is
obviously
to
protect
it
against
the
spread
of
whatever
dis--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--that's--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--i
do
not...
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
not--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--that's
correct.
mr.
barry
a.
short
the
direct
answer
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
is--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--is
that
you
do
not...
he
will
not
be
let
go.
mr.
barry
a.
short
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
a.
short
no,
i...
civil
commitment
is
what's
going
to
happen
to
this
individual
under
4241.
mr.
barry
a.
short
because
4241
provides
that
a
person
who
can't
stand
trial
because
they
are
legally
incompetent
are
referred
to
the
sections
of
4246.
the
director
at
that
facility,
under
section
4246,
will
then
have
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
dr.
sell
is
a
substantial
risk
to
persons
or
property
of
others
if--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--justice
souter,
i'm
saying
there
are
two
different
standards
at--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
a.
short
he
would.
he
would--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--he
is
subject
to
commitment
under
4246.
mr.
barry
a.
short
yes,
he
does.
he
does,
and--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--no,
that...
that's
not
what
will
happen
to
dr.
sell.
he
will
then
go
from
the
4241
to
4246,
at
which
time
the
director
of
that
facility
will
have
to
make
a
determination
whether
he
is
a
substantial
risk
to
others,
or
property
to
others,
if
he
is
released.
he
then
has
to
make
that
certification.
it
goes
to
the
district
court.
they
have
to
prove
that
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
if
they
so
show,
he
does
remain
committed.
mr.
barry
a.
short
no,
i
am
not...
i
am
not--
mr.
barry
a.
short
--no,
i
will
tell
you,
from
my
experience
in
this
case,
i
suspect
that's
precisely
what's
going
to
happen,
because
of
what
the
government's
view
is
of
this
individual.
mr.
barry
a.
short
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
a.
short
the
standard,
the
standard,
your
honor,
is
whether
or
not...
and
this
is
very
basic,
whether
the
person
has
the
right
to
make
the
choice.
our
position
is
that
dr.
sell
has
the
right
to
make
the
choice
over
his
medical
decisions.
he
has
had
experience
with
antipsychotic
drugs.
he
took
haldol
in
the
1980's.
he
had
an
attack
of
acute
dystonia,
which
this
court
has
recognized
as
being
a
serious
side
effect
in
at
least
three
cases,
harper,
riggins,
and
mills.
he
also
has
a
psychiatrist
that
has
told
him
that
antipsychotic
drugs
will
not
work
on
delusional
disorders,
and
dr.
sell,
with
all
due
respect
to
what
he's
charged
with,
is
not
a
stupid
person.
he
does
not
want
to
undergo
the
effects
of
antipsychotic
medication.
he
is
making
a
free
choice,
and
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
he
has
a
right
to
make
that
choice.
mr.
barry
a.
short
thank
you,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
barry
a.
short
i
only
have
2
minutes
i
need
to
use,
your
honor.
i
am
going
to
essentially
combine
one
of
the
comments
made
by
mr.
dreeben
with
questions
posed
by
justice
stevens.
mr.
dreeben
says
there
is
a...
we
are
talking,
of
course
by
a...
about
an
individual...
although
i
understand
there's
an
overall
concern
about
what
the
results
of
this
case,
case
are,
we
are
talking
about
dr.
sell
specifically,
and
the
government's
interest...
the
government
states
that
they
have
a
compelling
interest
in
prosecuting
dr.
sell.
now,
i
do
not
believe
the
statutory
maximum
is
what...
is
what
guides
here
on
the
thought
of
how
long
has
dr.
sell
been
in
custody.
dr.
sell
has
been
in
custody,
except
for
a
5-month
period
of
time
when
he
was
out
on
bond,
since
may
of
1997.
under
any
way
you
calculate
the
guidelines,
and
i
submit
the
guidelines
is
the
only
way
you
can
calculate
it,
he
has
served
much
more
time
than
he
would
have
served
had
he
been
convicted
and
sentenced
on
this
crime,
and
under
these
circumstances,
i
do
not
see
any
compelling
interest
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
prosecuting
this
defendant,
dr.
sell.
thank
you.
