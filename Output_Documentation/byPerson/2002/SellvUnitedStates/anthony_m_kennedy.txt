perhaps
it
depends
on
whether
we're
talking
about
the
right
to
avoid
medication,
as
opposed
to
the
right
to
avoid
medication
for
purposes
of
trial,
and
the
latter
would
give
you
maybe
somewhat
more
difficulty
under
prong
3,
whereas
the
former,
the
right
can
only
be
vindicated
by
treating
this
as
a
final
order.
would
you
accept
that,
or
would
you
say
that
it's
final
even
if
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
right
to
avoid
medication
for
purposes
of
standing
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
to
pursue
justice
stevens'
question,
that
order
was
in
the
context
of
this
criminal
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
is
your
general
principle
of
law
that
justifies
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
that
you
might
have
gone
further
in
your
case,
and
to
say
the
government
just
has
no
right
to
put
needles
into
pretrial
detainees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
they
can
make
the
defendant
wear
a
hat,
put
on
clothes,
give
a
voice
exempt
bar.
this
is
somehow
different.
it
seems
to
me
at
least
that
ought--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
don't
exactly
argue
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i...
i
don't
know
why
you
concede
that
the
government
has
this
right
at
all.
what
gives
the
government
the
authority
to
medicate
a
pretrial
detainee
or
someone
pretrial...
supposing
they're
not
even
in,
in
custody.
can
they
essentially,
out
with
a
needle
the
day
before
the
trial
and
say,
we're
going
to
get
you
ready
for
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
that's
pursuant
to
the
statute,
not
because
some
prosecutor
thinks
it's
a
good
idea.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how...
how
do
you
describe
the
authority
of
the
government
to
make
this
order
at
all?
suppose
this
defendant
were
under
a
voluntary
commitment
in
a
private
institution.
could
you
send
your
guy
out
there
with
a
needle
the
day
before
the
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
have...
you
have
this...
this...
this
case,
let's
assume
it's
this
person,
and
only
with
the
hypothetical
alteration
that
i've
given.
it's
this
person,
he's
in
a
private
facility,
voluntary
commitment--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--all
right,
so
what
is
the
authority
of
the
government
to
go
out
and
force
him
to
be
medicated
so
that
he
behaves
the
way
the
government
wants
him
to
at
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
inoculate
a
material
witness?
you
have
to
have
a
prosecution
witness.
he's
the
key
witness,
but
he's
incompetent.
could
you
force
him
to
be
inoculated
the
day
before
the
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
fully
understand
that,
and
i
want
to
know
if
they
can
be
medicated
and
what
your
authority
is
for
doing
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
at...
at
the
very
least
it
seems
to
me
that
you
should
have
statutory
authority
for
doing
this.
just
the
court
thinks
it's
a
good
idea
that
the
witnesses
behave
a
certain
way
and
order
medication--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
that,
that
was
competency
for
trial.
that's...
that's...
that's
the...
that's
not
the
standard
in
the
regulations,
as
i
understand
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
not
distinct
because
you
say
the
government
has
an
interest
in
having
him
medicated
for
trial.
i
don't
see
the
difference
in
somebody
who
is
at
liberty
and
in
custody.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
say
the
government
can
do
this
even
if
the
defendant
is,
is
not
in
custody,
and
just
to
follow
this
same
point,
suppose
a
defendant
not
in
custody,
at
home,
is
undergoing
a
hunger
strike
and
he's
going
to
die
before
the
trial.
can
the
government
come
out
and
force
feed
him?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if...
but
if
your...
but
if
your
interest
is
in
making
the
defendant
stand
trial,
it
would...
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
could
per...
suppose
it
was
for...
i
don't...
i...
we
could
play
with
the
hypothetical,
and
your
time
has
about
run
out.
i
still
just
don't
understand
your
basic
authority
to
do
this
at
all.
