justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
take
it,
that's
try...
that
is
tied
into
the
competence
to
stand
trial
because
he
thinks
that's
why
he
is
being
prosecuted,
is
that
it,
that
the
fbi
is
behind
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
how?
how
is
he
going
to
be
committed
if
he's
not
dangerous?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
you
are
telling
us...
and
you
are
telling
us,
are
you
not,
that
he
is
not
a
substantial
risk?
that...
that
that
may
not
be
something
we
accept
in
view
of
the
murder
charge,
but
i
mean,
on
your
theory,
you
are
saying
he's
not
dangerous.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize
there
are
two
different
standards,
but
there's...
if
i
understand
the
representations
you
have
been
making
to
the
court
about
your
client,
under
the
standard
for
commitment,
if
he
cannot
be
tried,
he
would
not
be
subject
to
commitment.
am
i
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
would...
so
are
you...
are
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--he
would
be
subject
to
commitment?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
satisfies
the
criteria
for
commitment?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
keep
saying,
if
they
show.
are
you
conceding
that,
in
fact,
the
evidence
is
there
to
show
it
and
that
he
will
be
in
fact
subject
to...
that
he
will,
in
fact,
be
lawfully
committed?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
don't
see
how
you've
answered
justice
scalia's
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
dreeben,
may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
this,
on
the
question
of
medication?
one
of
the
arguments
is
that
if
you
accept,
for
example,
essentially
your
standard
or
the
psychological
association's
standard,
in
applying
it,
you
cannot
apply
it,
as
it
were,
in
gross.
you've
got
to
apply
it
with
reference
to
the
specific
medication
which
is
proposed,
and
that
was
not
done
in
this
case.
i
think
the
argument
is,
it's
important
because
the
effects
of
the
various
possible
antipsychotic
medications
may
vary
tremendously.
would
you
comment
on
that
argument,
that
even
if
we
accept
the
standards,
they...
they
were
not
adequately
met
here
because
the...
the
order
was
not
drug-specific?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
of
course,
one
answer
to
that
is,
this
is
sufficiently
serious
so
that
you
ought
to
have
to
come
back.
in
other
words,
in...
in...
in...
the...
the
premise
of
your
argument
is
that
there's
kind
of
an
either-or
choice
that
is
made
here,
medicate
or
don't
medicate,
but
if
the...
if
the
substan...
if
a
substantive
due
process
right
is
recognized,
one
question
here
is,
how
serious
is
it,
and
maybe
it
ought
to
be
regarded
as
so
serious
that
the
government
would
have
to
come
back.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
a
different
question
about
seriousness,
and
i
think
it
was
raised
originally
by
a
question
from
justice
kennedy,
and
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
of
the
facts
or
of
your
answer.
should
we
treat
this,
assuming
we
are
going
to
recognize
it,
as
sufficiently
serious
that
the
government
should
have
no
power
in
the
absence
of
legislation,
and
if
that
is
so,
is
there
any
legislation
that
authorizes
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
treat
for
purposes
of
competency?
