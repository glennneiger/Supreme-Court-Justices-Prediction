justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
not
the
point.
the
point
is
whether
the
third
requirement
has
been
met,
that
it
is
effectively
nonreviewable
unless
it's
reviewed
this
way.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
reviewable.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
are
there...
are
there
no
ways
to
challenge
that,
except
in
the
context
of
the
criminal
prosecution?
i
mean,
if...
if
you
had
objections
to
being
medicated,
whether
for
purposes
of,
of
making
your
client
capable
of
standing
trial
or
not,
if
you
had
objections
to
being
medicated,
why
couldn't
those
objections
be
brought
under
section
1983
or
in
some
civil
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
concerns
me
is,
you
know,
the
cohen
doctrine
is
over
half
a
century
old.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
no
rooting
in
the
text.
the
text
of
congress'
statute
is
quite
absolute.
we
have
made
in
that
half
a
century
only
three
exceptions
under
the,
under
the
cohen
doctrine,
and
i'm
truly
concerned
about,
about
the
extent
to
which
this
new
exception
would,
would
be
available
to
disrupt
criminal
trials
considerably.
for
example,
a
defendant,
instead
of
challenging
the,
the
order
initially
can,
can
half-way
through
trial
decide
he
does
not
want
any
medication,
and
then
the
trial
has
to
be
postponed
so
that,
so
that
the
order
to
continue
the
medication
can
be
appealed.
i
just
see
real
difficulties
in
running
a
criminal
justice
system
when,
when
this
kind
of
an
order
is
immediately
appealable,
rather
than
reviewable
at
the
end
of
the
criminal
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you're
confusing
unreviewable
with
irreversible.
to
be
sure,
it
can't
be
reversed,
but
can
it
be
reviewed?
in
the
case
of
bail,
it
can't
be
reviewed,
because
once
the
trial
is
over,
it's
a
moot
question.
it
cannot
be
reviewed.
it's
not
just
that
it
can't
be
reversed,
it
cannot
be
reviewed.
but
you're
here
asserting
that
this
issue
cannot
be
reviewed.
it
seems
to
me
that's
just
patently
false.
it
can
be
reviewed.
your
complaint
is
that
it
can't
be
reversed,
but
that
has
never
been
the,
the
cohen
criterion.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
his...
if
that
is
his
objection,
and
if
his
objection
is
not
that
my
criminal
trial
will
be
distorted,
he
should
bring
a
separate
civil
action
and
perhaps
the
court
would
stay
the
criminal
action
until
that
one
is,
until
that
civil
action
is
determined,
but
it's
an
entirely
different
procedure
to
come
in
in
the
criminal
case
and
seek
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
that
order,
and
i
just
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
the
bureau
of
prisons
order
was
in
the
context
of
this
criminal
case?
i...
i
thought
that
they
ordered
him
to
be
medicated
before...
before
the
trial
was...
was
on
the
horizon.
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
then
he
should
be
able
to
stand
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he's
so
normal.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
is
your
solution
for
this
dilemma?
we
cannot
try
him
for
the
crime
that
he's
accused
of,
because
his
mind
is
not
working
properly.
he
is
entitled
to
refuse,
you
say,
drugs
that
would
cause
his
mind
to
work
properly.
it's
a
vicious...
what...
what
do
we
do
with
him?
do
we
continue
to
hold
him
with
the
inability
to
stand
trial,
not
treat
him,
because
he
refuses
treatment?
i...
it's
just
a
crazy
situation.
what
can
be
done
about
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
i
wish
you'd
go
back
to
a
question
i
asked
earlier
that
i
don't
think
i
got
an
answer
to.
what
do
you
propose
that
we
do
with
this
man?
he's
been
accused
of
a
serious
crime.
for
purposes
of
this
case
you're
willing
to
assume
it
to
be
the
same
if
he
had
been
accused
of
a
violent
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
is...
his
mental
ability
is
such
that
he
cannot
be
tried.
the
means
are
available
to
straighten
his
mind
out
so
that
he
is
competent
to
stand
trial,
but
you
say
no,
if
he
refuses
that,
we
must
respect
his
wishes.
then
what
do
we
do
with
him?
do
we
let
him
go?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
we
let
him
go.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i...
i
hope
that's
what's
going
to
happen,
but
i...
but
i
don't
know
how
it...
how
it
comes
about
with
the
law
as
you've
described
it
to
us.
that's...
that's
my
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i'd
be
less
worried
if,
if
all
that
was
before
us
here
is
the
up
or
down
question
whether
you
have
an
absolute
right
to
refuse
medication,
and
once
that
is
disposed
of,
the
issue
goes
away,
but
that's
not
what's
before
us
here.
that
is
not
the
only
thing
before
us
here.
the...
there
is
also
the
question,
assuming
that
you
can
be
medicated,
what
are
the
criteria,
and
i
assume
that
any
prisoner
can
make
the
claim,
i
have
a
right
not
to
be
medicated
unless
these
criteria
are
fulfilled,
so
in
every
criminal
case
you're
going
to
have
a
pre...
with
someone
who
has
psychological
difficulties,
or
who
is
found
to
be
not
triable
because
of
his
mental
state,
you
have
to
have
this
preliminary
appeal
all
the
way
up
before
the
trial
can
even
start.
it...
it's
not
a
one-time
thing.
