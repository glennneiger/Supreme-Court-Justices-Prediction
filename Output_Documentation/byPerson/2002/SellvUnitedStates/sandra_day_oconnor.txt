mr.
short,
did
that
subject
jurisdiction
come
up
when
you
were
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
interlocutory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
the
issue.
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
the
question.
would...
if
it...
if
we
did
not
think
there
were
jurisdiction,
then
at
the
end
of
the
day,
if
the
defendant
were
tried,
i
suppose
that
issue
could
be
raised
then.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
a
finding
we
have
from
the
lower
courts,
that
he
is
not
dangerous
to
himself
or
others?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
he's
legally
incompetent,
you
say--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
stand
trial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
there
a
finding
below
that
medication
will...
there's
a
substantial
probability
he
would
be
restored
to
competence
if
there
were
medication?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
there
a
finding
that
no
less
intrusive
alternative
is
available
to
restore
him
to
competence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
the
medication
is
medically
appropriate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
even
under
those
circumstances,
you
assert
that
there
can
be
no
medication?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought,
looking
at
your
brief,
that
you
were
asserting
that
the
petitioner
has
a
right
to
be
free
from
compelled
medication
by
the
government,
period,
per
se.
that's
the
rule.

day
o'connor
page
26
of
your
brief.
so
you
don't...
you
don't
go
along
with
any
other
standards.
you're
saying
there
is
an
absolute
right
to
be
free
from
compelled
medication.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about...
how
about...
how
about
vaccinating
little
children
with
a
needle
against
smallpox?
i
guess
there's
no
right
to
do
that
by
the
government?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
would
certainly
be
a
new
exception
to
the
collateral
order
doctrine,
would
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you,
if
we
reach
the
question
of
what
standards
to
apply,
it
doesn't
fit
comfortably
in
any
setting
with
which
we're
familiar,
strict
scrutiny,
rational
basis
test.
do
you
see
this
as
somewhere
in
between
some
kind
of
heightened
review,
and
if
so,
what
case
do
you
think
is
closest?
