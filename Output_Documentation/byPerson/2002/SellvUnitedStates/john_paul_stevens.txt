justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
back...
about
the
background
order?
isn't
it
correct
that
in
this
case
the
bureau
of
prisons
got
an
order
authorizing
them
to
medicate
your,
your
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
you
got
a
stay
of
that
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
that
i've
been
trying
to...
thinking
about
for
quite
a
while?
is
the
amount
of
time
he's
already
been
in
custody,
as
compared
to
the
potential
sentence
he
might
receive,
relevant
to
the
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
that
not
true
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
the
maximum
sentence,
rather
than
what
the
sentencing
guidelines
would
provide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
assumed
it
was
the
sentencing
guidelines
rather
than
the
maximum
statutory
sentence,
is
it
not
true
that
his
period
of
confinement
has
already
approached
that,
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
was
not...
that
was
not
part
of
the
analysis,
as
i
understood
it,
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
relied
entirely
on
the
financial
crimes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
critical
to
your
position
in
this
case
that
we
take
into
account
the
indictment
for...
for...
for
attempted
murder?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
time
he's
already
been
in
custody
exceeds
the
time
he
would
get
under
the
sentencing
guidelines?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
other
question,
just
to
be
sure
i
have
your
understanding
on
it?
has
he
or
has
he
not
been
getting
civil...
getting
treatment
during
the
period
of
his
detention?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
not
getting
medicine...
i
know
he's
not
getting
medical,
medicine,
but
has
he
been
getting
any
other
kind
of
treatment
for
his
ailment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
last
question
before
your
light
goes
off?
under
the
statute
that
provides
credit
for
prior
custody,
would
this
defendant's
custody
in
the...
count?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would,
okay.
