justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
doesn't
sound
nondangerous.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
are
we
supposed
to
do,
just
do
this
on
the
hypothetical
basis
that
he
isn't,
although
maybe
he
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
didn't...
he
did--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
a
person
who's
in
a
mental
hospital,
civilly
committed,
and
he's
dangerous,
going
to
commit
suicide
or
possibly
kill
someone,
that
the
doctors
in
that
civil
setting
are
forbidden
to
administer
psychotic
drugs?
that's
not
my
understanding.
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
you're
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but...
so...
but
my
question
on
this
case
is
the
following.
i
take
it
you
say,
to
follow
the
psychological
association's
standards,
one,
the
court
did
consider
whether
any
nondrug
therapy
could
restore
him
to
competence,
and
it
answered
the
question,
no.
the
court
did
consider
whether
there
was
a
substantial
likelihood
of
success
in
restoring
the
defendant
to
competence,
and
they
answered,
yes.
the
court
did
consider
whether
the
effectiveness
of
the
drugs
clearly
outweighed
the
risk
from
side
effects,
and
it
said
yes.
it
also
considered
the
effects
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
to
fair
trial,
and
decided
they
weren't
enough
to
change
the
question,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
once
you
concede
all
that,
they're
following
the
right
standards.
so
is
your
claim
that
we
should
go
and
review
because
they,
although
they
purported
to
follow
the
right
standards
they
didn't
really
do
it,
in
other
words,
going
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
or
is
your
claim
that
those
standards
that
your
side's
amicus
says
are
the
right
ones,
are
not
the
right
ones
and,
if
so,
what
are?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
would
appreciate
a
direct
answer
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
to
me,
either
you
have
to
say
that
the
psychological
association
standards
are
wrong,
or
you
have
to
say
they're
right,
and
if
you
say
they're
right,
then
you
have
to
ask
us
to
say
they
weren't
applied
correctly
here,
but
i
want
to
know
if
you
think
they're
the
wrong
ones,
or
if
you
think
they're
the
right
ones.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you
read...
if
you'd
simply
read
the
table
of
contents,
as
i'm
certain
you
have--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
the
apa,
the
psychological
association's
brief,
filed
on
your
side--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
have
four
standards,
so
i'm
asking
you
if
you
think
those
are
the
right
standards.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
if
you
think
those
are
there
right
standards,
do
you
think
they
were
applied
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
then
is
what
you're
asking
us
to
do,
since
you
think
they
were
applied,
and
you
don't
like
the
answer
the
court
came
to,
is
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
today
is
take
those
standards,
look
to
see
how
the
court
applied
them,
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
applied
them
incorrectly,
or
are
you
asking
us
to
do
something
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
trying
to
clarify--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
you
think
these
standards
are
wrong.
the
standards...
can
you
come
up
in
your
mind--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
won't
pursue
this,
but
i'm
just
trying
to
clarify
what
it
is
you
want
us
to
do.
now,
call
into
your
own
mind
the
standards
of
the
american
psychological
association.
i
read
that
amicus
with
some
care,
i'm
very
interested,
and
it
seemed
to
me
similar
in
principle
to
the
government's
point
of
view,
and
i
want
to
know,
in...
though
they
may
not
think
they're
applied
correctly
here,
but
what...
what...
tell
me
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the...--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
a
different
problem.
let
me
explain
to
you
what...
i
imagine
that
the
slogan,
mind-altering
drugs,
is
not
a
very
good
slogan
for
present
purposes,
because
there
are
a
lot
of
seriously
ill
people
whom
these
drugs
do
help
a
lot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
we're
thinking
of
that
class
of
people,
how
are
they
any
different
from
the
class
of
people
with
very,
very
high
blood
pressure
whose
lives
are
at
risk,
and
could
be
perhaps
medicated
with
blood
pressure
medicine.
these
people
could
be
medicated
with
antidelusional
medicine.
now,
is
there
a
difference
between
those
two
circumstances?
that
doesn't
answer
the
question,
because
what
i'm
looking
for
are
the
right
standards
to
use
to
separate
those
genuinely
ill
people
from
others
who
may
be
more
borderline,
or
may
be
less
obviously
helped.
now,
you
don't...
i
realize
now
you
don't
have
much
time,
but
i'm...
that's
what
i'm
struggling
with
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right,
suppose
he's
not.
then
he
goes
free.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
question
i
would
like
to
know
is,
suppose
that
you
have
a
person
who
has
very
high
blood
pressure,
a
defendant.
is
it
permissible,
or
clearly
permissible
under
the
law,
to
force
him
to
take
blood
pressure
medication
so
that
he
can
go
to
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
we
have
exactly
the
same
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
the
question
is
not
necessarily
about
psychiatry.
it's
about
whether
or
not
you
can
force
a
person
to
take
medicine
that
makes
him
competent
to
stand
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
why
it
would
be...
it
may
or
may
not
be--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--different
with
psychiatry,
but
then
the
question
comes
back
to,
assuming
we
have
the
right
standards,
which
are,
i
think
you
and
the
apa
agree,
the
psychological
people,
i
don't
see
much
of
a
difference
there
between
you,
the
lower
courts,
and
the...
as
to
the
standards
if
you
can
medicate
a
comp...
if
you
can
medicate
such
a
person
at
all,
and
so
what
we
know
is
that
you
can
go
to
the
person
with
high
blood
pressure
or
the
person
who
is
seriously
mentally
ill,
and
you
can
medicate
him,
because
the
government
has
a
good
reason,
where
he
is
going
to
be
tried
for
murder,
assault,
et
cetera,
all
right.
here
we
have
a
property
crime.
is
this
still
a
good
reason?
suppose
it
were
a
traffic
ticket?
i
mean,
i
take
it
this
is
a
person
whom,
in
the
absence
of
a
criminal
proceeding,
the
government
could
not
compel
to
take
medication.
am
i
right?
now,
i've
given
you
a
number
of
things.
i'm
trying
to
elicit
your
views
on
things
that
are
of
concern
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it's
not
obviously
distinct,
because
i
am
assuming
a
person
who
is
not
a
danger
to
himself
or
others
is,
in
fact,
in
that
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
now,
if
you
want
to
make
a
difference,
fine,
do
it.
i
start
out
with
the
proposition
that
a
person
who
is
wandering
around
a
free
person
now
suddenly
is
charged.
now
he
says,
i
have
very
high
blood
pressure
and
i
won't
take
my
medicine,
or
he
says,
i'm
delusional
and
i
won't
take
my
medicine.
if...
can
the
government
compel
person
1
or
person
2
to
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
where
it's
murder
and
assault,
if
they're
about
to...
a
traffic
ticket?
no,
all
right.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
that's...
if
that's
your--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
that's
exactly
right,
that
is
my
question,
because
i
thought
that's
what
was
at
issue
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
most
intrusive
thing
that
it's
clear
the
government
can
do
to
get
the
defendant
inside
the
courthouse
door?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
physically
seizing
him,
shackling
him,
i
guess.
anything
else?
