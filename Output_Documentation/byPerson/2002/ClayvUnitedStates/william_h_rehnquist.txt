we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
01-1500,
eric
cornell
clay
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
now
our
retroactivity
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
those
come
from
quite
diverse
contexts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
link...
linkletter
was
really
a
bygone
era
by
the
time
congress
passed
aedpa.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the...
the...
that
doesn't...
the
sentence
doesn't
end
with
judgment
became
final.
it
goes
on
to
say,
by
the
conclusion
of
direct
review,
or
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
seeking
such
review.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
you're
going
to
get
state
post-conviction
review
in
connection
with
federal
habeas
cases
because
of
the
exhaustion
requirement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you're...
when
you're
appealing
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals,
when
does
the
term,
final...
what
does
the
term
of
final
mean
there,
as
to
the
district
court
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
goldstein.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
an
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
that's
contrary
to
a
lot
of
other
things,
is
it
not?
i
mean,
you
can't
go
into
the
district
court
60
days
after
your
time...
after
the
district
final
judgment
was
entered
and
still
maybe
have
30
more
days
to
appeal,
and
the
district
court
isn't
going
to
do
anything.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why...
why
should
those
be
different?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
that...
except
that
they
wrote
the
two
sections
differently.
that...
that
certainly
is
something
of
a
reason.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i...
i
think,
mr.
roberts,
that
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
question
to
petitioner's
counsel,
2250...
44(d)(1)
doesn't
just
stop
with
the
word,
final,
it
goes
on
to
kind
of
explicate
the
possible...
possible
meanings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts,
refresh
my
recollection.
was
2255
and
22...
and
2240(d)(1)
enacted
as
part
of
the
same
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
de
bruin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if...
if
you're...
if
you're
going
to
say
that
2255,
by
contrast
with
2244(d)(1)
must
mean
something
broader,
then...
though,
the
broader
you
define
finality,
the
more
difficult
it
is
for
a
petitioner
to
make
his
case,
it
seems
to
me...
a
habeas
petitioner.
if
there
are
any
number
of
different
ways
that
a
judgment
can
become
final,
that...
that
is
bad
for
the
person
seeking
habeas
relief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
de
bruin,
and
the
court
thanks
you
for
your
help
to
the
court
with
your
amicus
brief
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goldstein,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
set
of
rule
33
are
we
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
what
set,
what--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--criminal
procedure.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
