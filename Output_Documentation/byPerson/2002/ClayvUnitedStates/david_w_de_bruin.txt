mr.
david
w.
debruin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
four
points
that
are
dispositive
of
this
case.
first,
the
most
natural
and
logical
inference
is
that
the
textual
language
in
section
2255
cannot
mean
exactly
the
same
thing
as
the
very
different
textual
language
enacted
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
statute
in
section
2244.
second,
the
text
of
each
provision
has
an
ordinary
and
accepted
meaning
that
is
not,
in
fact,
the
same.
third,
there
are
at
least
three
reasons
why
congress
logically
used
a
different
trigger
for
the
limitation
periods
in
section
2244
and
2255,
and
fourth,
no
harmful
or
absurd
consequences
flow
from
a
determination
that
congress
did
not
intend
these
very
different
provisions
with
their
very
different
texts
to
mean
precisely
the
same
thing,
as
the
parties
here
contend,
and
for
these
reasons,
i
submit
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
correct,
and
it
should
be
affirmed.
the
russello
presumption
in
this
case
is
particularly
strong.
congress,
in
fact,
used
three
different
formulations
in
aedpa
in
identifying
triggers
for
time
limitations
under
the
statute,
2244,
2255,
as
we've
talked
about,
and
also
2263.
in
each
of
those
formulations,
enacted
in
the
same
statute
at
the
same
time,
congress
explicitly
chose
different
words
to
describe
what
the
triggering
event
was
and
what
the
consequences
of
subsequent
events
were.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
i
believe...
i
have
the
exact
language,
that
in
russello,
the...
the
general
was
any
interest
acquired.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
correct,
any
interest
in
any
enterprise
which
the
defendant
has
established.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
well,
i
think
the...
the
meaning
of
becomes
final
in
2255
is,
in
a
sense,
broader,
in
that
there
are
different
conditions
that
can
trigger
when
a
judgment
becomes
final.
the...
the
normal
rule
is
that
judgments
of
courts
become
final
when
the
court
acts,
not
upon
the
expiration
of
review.
that
finality,
however,
may
be
disrupted,
or
arrested
by
subsequent
filings.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
no--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--no,
for
two
reasons.
one,
congress
logically
can
include
the
first
phrase,
the
conclusion
of
direct
review,
as
a
means
of
clarifying
and
contrasting
its
inclusion
of
the
second
or
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
seeking
such
review.
that
is
the
unusual
clause.
typically,
judgments
become
final
when
the
court
acts.
they're
not
dependent
upon
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
review
for
finality
to
attach.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
but
that
is
an
action
of
the
court,
justice
ginsburg.
in
other
words,
the
point
is,
and
the
parties
agree
that
the
word
final
does
have
different
meanings
in
different
contexts.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
and...
and
i
don't
dispute
that,
but
in
this
case,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
final,
and
it
is
guided
by
two
things.
the
meaning
of
final
in
2255
is
informed
by
the
language
in
2244,
where
congress
provided
a
very
specific
definition
there
that
it
did
not
employ
in
2255.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
not
actually
clear.
it
is
not
clear
that
congress
in
2255
intended
either
formulation
to
be
the
defining
point
in
all
cases.
under
rule
33,
there
was
very
similar
language
that
triggered
a
time
bar
to...
to
when
the
judgment
became
final
and,
as
interpreted
by
the
courts
there,
finality
was
not
always
coextensive
with
the
conclusion
of
direct
review.
the
rule
there,
universally
established,
was
that
if
a
court
of
appeals
issued
its
mandate
and
a
stay
of
the
mandate
was
not
obtained,
the
2-year
clock
under
rule
33
began
to
run
from
the
date
of
the
mandate
whether
or
not
the
defendant,
not
having
obtained
a
stay,
petitioned
this
court
for
certiorari.
so
although
the
question
is
not
presented
in
this
case,
it
is
not
automatically
clear
that
congress
in
2255
meant
either
of
the
triggers
that
appear
in
2244,
but,
as
this
court
recognized
in
russello,
these
provisions
do
not
need
to
be
mutually
coextensive.
one
can
be
a
subset
of
the
other.
in
this
instance,
congress
could
include
the
words,
the
conclusion
of
direct
review,
simply
to
provide
clarity
that
it
also
wanted
to
include
the
unusual
event,
which
was
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
seeking
such
review.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
what
is--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--yes,
i
believe.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
but
what
is
significant,
justice
breyer,
is
that
that
argument
essentially
undercuts
their
argument
that
congress,
in
enacting
2255,
was
using
an
established
meaning
of
final,
coming
from
this
court's
precedents
in
their
retroactivity
cases.
if
congress
believed
that
the
word
final,
as
used
in
2255,
standing
alone,
without
clarification,
automatically
conveyed
the
definition
this
court
has
used
in
the
retroactivity
cases,
that
definition,
as
this
court
knows,
applies
equally
to
state
convictions
as
well
as
to
federal
convictions.
in
fact,
that
rule
in
linkletter
was
originally
developed
in
the
context
of
review
of
a
state
conviction.
in
griffith,
the
court
applied
that
same
concept
of
finality
both
to
a
state
conviction
and
to
a
federal
conviction,
so
if
congress
thought
by
using
just
the
word
final,
we
mean,
in
essence,
the
retroactivity
definition--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--that
would
have
applied
to
both.
but
conversely,
if
congress
was
aware
that
that
word,
final,
might
mean
something
different,
then
the
obvious
differences
in
wording
here
make
a
meaningful
difference.
2244
means
what
congress
specified.
the
point
is,
there
is
no
greater
reason
to
believe
that
the
court's
definition
in
the
retroactivity
cases
applies
in
2255
but
not
2244.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
i
think
what
you
have
done
is,
you've
rendered
the
words
of
section
2244,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
wholly
superfluous.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
i--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--i
believe
that's
correct.
i
believe--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--i
think
congress
certainly
could
have
enacted
a
statute
that
had
the
same
trigger.
i
think
there
also
are
significant
reasons
why
it
made
sense
for
congress
not
to
use
the
same
trigger.
there
are--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--justice
scalia,
what--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--what
i
think
defeats
that
is
that
there
isn't
anything
else.
there
isn't
a
broader
universe
that--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--i
think
that's
right.
as,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
recognized,
the
habeas...
there...
there's
an
interest
in
setting
the
date
and
in
a
non-capital
case,
as
these
cases
will
be,
where
certiorari
has
not
been
sought,
if
claims
are
to
be
brought,
have
the
statute
begin,
the
claims
be
filed,
if
relief
is
appropriate,
relief
be
granted;
but
what
i
think
is
significant,
justice
scalia,
is
that
there
is
no
broader
meaning
of
final
that
anyone
has
ever
articulated.
the...
the
broadest
definition
that
has
been
identified
is
that
which
is
set
forth
in
2244,
the
conclusion
of
direct
review,
or,
what
is
not
normally
included
for
finality,
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
seeking
the
conclusion
of
direct
review,
as
opposed--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--they--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--i...
i...
they're
extensions,
is
exactly
right,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
that
finality
normally
occurs
when
a
court
acts.
here,
when
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
mandate,
nothing
else
happened
in
the
case.
mr.
clay
did
not--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--yes.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
well,
two
points.
one,
i
believe
2244
makes
clear
that
whatever
2255
means,
it
can't
mean
exactly
the
same
thing
as
2244,
because
congress
didn't
use
those
words.
that
still
leaves
the
question,
well,
what,
then,
does
becomes
final
mean
in
2255?
does
it
mean
when
the
court
of
appeals
issues
its
judgment?
does
it
mean
when
it
issues
its
mandate?
those
questions
still
need
to
be
answered.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
that
is
correct.
the
90-day
clock
runs
from
the...
from
the
entry
of
judgment,
not
the
mandate,
but
in
deciding
that
question,
what
did
congress
mean
by
final,
assuming
it's
not
what
it
said
in
2244.
because
it
didn't
say
that
here,
the
court
has
to
decide,
is
it
the
judgment,
is
it
the
mandate,
and
there
is,
in
fact,
a
developed
body
of
law
under,
i
submit,
a
very
analogous
situation.
under
rule
33,
the
defendant
had
2
years
from
final
judgment
to
bring
a
claim,
and
the
courts
had
interpreted
finality
in
that
context
to
mean
when
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
mandate.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
i
think--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--i
agree
with
you--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--i
agree
with
you
that
russello
sets
a
presumption,
it's
not
an
automatic
rule,
but
what
is
significant
in
this
case
is
not
just
that
there's
a
formulation
that
appears
essentially
the
same,
but
in
different
words.
what
you
have
is
two
provisions,
2244
and
2255,
that
are
markedly
parallel.
you
cannot
read
them,
going
along
almost
word-for-word,
and
then
you
get
to
this
difference...
which
is
not
a
minor
difference,
but
there's
an
entire
qualifying
clause
added...
and
not
be
struck:
"congress
must
have
meant
something
different
or
they
would
not
have
diverged
so
significantly.
"
mr.
david
w.
debruin
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
concede
that.
i
don't
concede
that
it
is
true
that
if
a
petition
is
filed,
that
the
clock
is
automatically
arrested
so
that
automatically
the
conclusion
of
direct
review
isn't
counted.
that's
not
really
presented
here
because
there
was
no
petition,
it
may
be
congress
did
not
mean
for
either
of
those
clauses
to
be
in
all
cases
the
determinative
fact
under
2255.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
it
could
mean
that,
and
that
was,
in
fact,
the
established
rule
under
rule
33,
which
is
a
very
similar
time
mechanism,
and
i
submit
the
most
appropriate
context
is,
look
at
other
congressional
enactments
imposing
time
limits
on
the
bringing
of
claims
after
judgment,
and
the
rule
under
rule
33
was
cert
was
irrelevant
unless
a
stay
of
the
mandate
was
obtained
under
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
41;
and,
of
course,
under
41(c)
you
can
obtain
a
stay
of
the
mandate
if
a
substantial
question
exists
for
the
presentation
of
a
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
i
don't
believe
that
is
a
general
rule.
the
most
analogous
rule,
as
it
existed
both
under
the
speedy
trial
act
and
under
rule
33,
was
that
simply
petitioning
this
court
for
certiorari
did
not
automatically
arrest
the
finality
of
a
judgment
for
either
of
those
two
statutes:
only
if
you
got
a
stay
of
the
mandate.
that's
the
whole
purpose
under
rule
41(c)
for
providing
for
a
stay
of
the
mandate;
and,
of
course,
it's
that
rule
that
the
simple
filing
of
a
petition,
that's
what
may
engender
meritorious
petitions,
which
the
government
contends
is
a
reason
not
to
interpret
2255
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
did
below.
it
makes
sense,
i
submit,
not
to
have
a
rule
that
the
automatic
filing
arrests
the
finality
of
the
judgment,
and
that
was,
in
fact,
the
rule
under
rule
33,
and
that's
the
way
the
speedy
trial
act
has
been
interpreted,
and
other
statutes
of
limitations,
that
the
filing
for
cert
does
not
automatically
trigger
the...
or
disrupt
the
statute.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
yes,
but
first
i
must
correct
you.
under
this
overall
statutory
scheme,
i
submit
federal
prisoners
have
more
time,
not
less,
and
the
reason
for
that,
it
is
wrong
for
the
parties
to
argue,
as
they
do,
that
this
construction
of
2255
is
necessary
to
ensure
parity.
there
is
no
parity.
as
the
court
knows
from
its
decision
in
duncan
versus
walker,
and
just
last
term
in
carey
versus
saffold,
the
1-year
statute
under
2244
applies
to
the
preparation
of
two
different
things.
it
applies
to
the
preparation
of
your
state
collateral
petition,
and
then
once
that
is
filed,
but
only
after
it's
filed,
there
is
tolling,
as
was
at
issue
in
duncan
versus
walker
and
carey
versus
saffold;
and
then
after
the
state
petition
is
resolved,
but
not
including
certiorari,
that's
very
clear,
then
you've
got
to
file
your
federal
2254
petition.
so
a
state
inmate
has
one
year
to
do
both,
prepare
his
state
collateral
claim,
assuming
total
exhaustion
under
rose
versus
lundy,
and
then,
after
the
state
collateral
petition
is
resolved,
the
federal
collateral
petition.
the
federal
inmate,
by
contrast,
has
a
full
year
simply
to
bring
his
2255
motion.
so
it
is
not
true
that
only
by
forcing
this
different
language
in
2244
and
2255
to
mean
the
same
thing,
will
you
achieve
parity.
there
isn't
parity.
federal
inmates
have
more
time.
but
there
are,
in
any
event,
reasons
for
that
difference.
again,
claims
coming
from
state
court
by
definition
must
be
exhausted,
previously
litigated
claims.
by
definition,
2255
claims
cannot
be
the
same
claims
that
were
litigated
on
direct
review.
i
submit
it
makes
logical
sense
for
congress
to
allow
the
state
claim,
previously
litigated
in
state
court,
to
run
its
full
course
at
least
through
cert
on
direct
review
before
starting
the
statute.
if
this...
and
i
submit
teague
here
really
provides
a
reason.
since
this
court
has
recognized
that
if
it
were
to
issue
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
procedure
before
the
time
expired
to
file
for
cert,
and
if
one
of
the
petitioner's
state
claims
was
litigated
on
direct
review,
it
is
less
an
affront
to
the
state
system
for
this
court
to
simply
grant,
vacate,
and
remand
than
for
a
lower
federal
court
to
take
up
that
claim
on
habeas.
so
congress
logically
could
have
said
that
the
time
to
begin
the
statute
will
not
run
until
the
expiration
of
time
for
the
conclusion
of
direct
review.
there
are
reasons
such
as
that
that
could
provide
an
explanation
for
why
congress
did
what
it
did,
which
is
to
provide
very
different
triggers
in
these
two
statutes.
fourth,
it's
important
that
there
are
no
harmful
consequences
that
follow
from
granting
these
two
different
provisions,
with
their
very
different
text,
different
meanings.
as
i
mentioned,
federal
defendants
will
always
have
at
least
one
full
year
from
the
issuance
of
the
mandate
to
bring
their
claim.
as
this
court
has
recognized,
in
a
non-capital
case,
the
defendant
has
no
interest
in
delaying
the
adjudication
of
any
collateral
claims
that
may
exist.
the
construction
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
clear
and
easy
to
administer.
the
federal
inmate
has
one
year
from
the
issuance
of
the
mandate
if
not--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--you
are
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
held
universally
that
if
you
petition
for
cert,
the
1-year
period
does
not
begin
to
run
until
the
petition
is
resolved,
and
that
rule
is
not
presented
here.
there
is,
in
fact...
authority
goes
both
ways,
that
subsequent
filings
in
a
different
court
at
times
do
arrest
the
finality
of
a
prior
judgment,
and
at
times
they
do
not.
my
only
point
was,
in
looking
at
the
language
of
2244
and
asking
whether
the
language
there,
the
conclusion
of
direct
review
defeats
the
russello
presumption,
my
point
simply
is,
it
does
not
defeat
it.
one
interpretation
is
that
congress
didn't
mean
either
to
apply
here,
and
instead
embraced
a
rule
much
like
the
established
practice
under
rule
33,
but
even
if...
the
court
does
not
need
to
accept
that
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
here.
the
rule
logically
could
be
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
issues
its
mandate,
the
case
is
over
in
the
court
of
appeals.
nothing
else
happens,
no
motion
to
stay,
no
petition
for
cert.
the
case
is
final.
that's...
that's
consistent
with
common
understanding
of
the
word.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
no,
but...
i'm
sorry,
but
continuing
on
my
thought,
if
nothing
happens,
the
case
is
final
when
the
court
of
appeals
rules.
you
have
a
year.
if,
however,
you
petition
for
cert,
then
the
judgment,
the
finality
of
the
judgment
is
arrested,
and
the
one
year
does
not
begin
to
run
until
the
petition
is
resolved.
that
would
be
perfectly
permissible.
in
other
words...
and
that
is,
in
fact,
the
construction
of
the
seventh
circuit,
that--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--you
would
get
a
whole
new
period,
and
that
is
consistent
with--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--it's
not
tolling.
now,
congress
has
provided
tolling
under
2263.
it
has
provided
tolling
under
different
aspects
of
the
statute.
but
no,
this
is
not
tolling.
there...
there
are
established
rules
that
a
judgment
is
final,
but
yet,
if
you
file
a
motion
for
reconsideration,
for
instance,
the
finality
of
the
judgment,
even
though
it
was
final
and
the
time
bars
were
running,
finality
is
arrested;
and
then
once
the
petition
for
reconsideration
is
decided,
you
have
a
full
period,
again,
and
so
justice
ginsburg,
that
would
be
a
perfectly
permissible
construction,
and
in
fact,
perhaps
the
most
logical
construction,
that
if
you
petition
for
cert,
the
finality
of
the
judgment
is
arrested
and
you
have
a
full
year.
the
point
is,
finality
will
always
be
affected
by
what
the
defendant
does
and
does
not
do,
and
there
will
always
be
a
series
of
different
rules,
depending
on
whether
a
petition
for
cert
was
filed,
whether
an
appeal
was
filed,
and
there
will
be
different
rules
from
state
as
well
as
federal.
there's
a
whole
series
of
different
rules;
but
the
rule
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was,
if
nothing
happens
after
the
court
of
appeals
issues
its
decision,
the
judgment
is
final
within
the
meaning
of
2255.
that's
consistent
with
the
fact
that
judgments
routinely
are
final
without
being
dependent
upon
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
review.
the
formulation
in
2244
is,
in
fact,
unusual.
congress
provided
for
that
in
2244,
but
did
not
provide
for
that
in
2255.
for
all
these
reasons,
i...
i
urge
the
court
to
find
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct,
the
construction
of
the
language
affords
the
text
its
natural
meaning,
does
not
work
any
harmful
results,
and
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
thank
you.
