justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
can
also
say
that
they
had
to
give
a
special
meaning
of
finality
so
that
we
could
respect
the
processes
of
the
states
and
make
it
clear
that
the...
all
of
the
state
procedures
had
to
be
exhausted,
as
the
chief
justice
indicated,
because
of
the
intrusive
nature
of...
of
habeas
jurisprudence,
of
habeas
orders
from
the
federal
courts,
and
so
you
can
read
this
as...
as
being
an
exception
to
this
general
federal
rule
when,
in
fact...
that
brings
me
to
another
point...
you
can
address
both.
i...
i
had...
i
had
thought,
as
the
amicus
brief
does
indicate,
that
finality
usually
does
mean
from
the
date
of
the
issuance
of
the
mandate,
and
then
you
go
back
and
you
toll
if
there's...
if
there's
discretionary
review.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
characterize
for...
for
us,
then,
your
understanding
of
the
amicus
view.
i
thought
their
view
is
that
it
just
becomes
tolled.
the
minute
you...
the
minute
you
file
the
appeal
it
becomes
tolled,
so
there's
no
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
i
should
think
the
normal
rule
does
include
the
tolling
exception
that
i...
that
i...
we've
just
explained.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's...
that's
not
quite
tolling.
if...
if
you...
if
you
waited
for,
say,
40
days
before
you
filed,
does
the
40
days
count
again?
do
you
tack,
or
do
you
get
a
whole
new
period?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
that's
not
quite
like
tolling,
i
think.
