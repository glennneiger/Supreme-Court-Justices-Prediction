mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
defendant
does
not
petition
this
court
for
certiorari
on
direct
appeal,
his
judgment
of
conviction
becomes
final
within
the
meaning
of
section
2255
when
the
time
for
filing
a
petition
expires.
that
interpretation
accords
with
the
well-settled
meaning
of
final
and
the
law
of
collateral
review,
and
it
sensibly
provides
federal
prisoners
the
same
time
to
prepare
collateral
attacks
as
similarly
situated
state
prisoners.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
judgment
would
become
final
if
there...
if
no
appeal
was
filed
at
the
time...
when
the
time
to
file
an
appeal
expired
after
the
10-day
period.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
we're
talking
about
finality
for...
for
a
different
purpose
here.
it's
not
a
question
of
finality
for
the
purpose
of
seeking
appeal,
or
when
a
judgment...
in
the
term
like
final
judgment,
which
is...
which
would
be
the
sense
of
finality
when,
for
the
purposes
of
deciding--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
in...
in
terms
of...
of
collateral
review,
first
of
all
the
congress
used
the
particular
phrase,
when
the
judgment
becomes
final,
that
has
an
established
meaning
in
that
context.
second
of
all,
it's
logical
that
the
time
to
commence
collateral
review
should
start
to
run
at
the
conclusion
of
direct
review,
which
this
court
has
made
clear
includes
the
period
when...
within
which
to
seek
certiorari
even
if
a
petition
isn't
filed,
and
that's,
in
fact,
what
congress
concluded
in
section
2244,
the
parallel
provision
for
state
prisoners,
and
there's
no
persuasive
reason
why
congress
would
have
started
the...
the
time
limitation
at
a
different
time
for
federal
prisoners.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
that...
that...
well,
i'm
talking
about
a...
a
reason
why
they
would
have
intended
that
result
as
opposed
to
a...
a
canon
or
a
textual
indication
that
there
might
be
a
difference,
but
even
as
to
the
textual
indication--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--but--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--but
this
doesn't
concern
the
processes
of
the
state,
your
honor,
it
concerns
review
in...
in
this
court,
and
this
court's
made
clear
the...
the
distinction
of
the
time
is
between
whether
the...
the
time
to
seek
review
in
this
court
is
included
or
is
not
included,
and
that's
not
a...
a
state...
a
remedy,
this
court's
made
clear
that
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
doesn't
require
a
petitioner
to
seek
review
in
this
court,
that
state
remedies
are
exhausted
as
long
as
all
avenues
of
review
are
pursued
in...
in
the
state
court
system.
so
concerns
about...
concerns
about
requiring
them
to
go
through
the
full
state
court
system
wouldn't
justify
the
difference
in
the
rule,
nor
would
generalized
concerns
about
comity,
which
would
suggest
that
state
prisoners
ought
to
have
less
time
to
seek
review
from
their
convictions,
if...
if
anything,
to
upset
their
state
court
convictions,
rather
than...
than
more
time.
and
really,
collateral
review
rules
are
driven
more
by
finality
concerns,
which
are
equally
strong
in
the
federal
context
and
the
state
context.
that's
why
the
teague
retroactivity
rules
and
rules
of
procedural
default
apply
equally
to
both,
and
because
finality
concerns
are
the
same,
there...
there
isn't
any
persuasive
reason
why
congress
would
have
started
the
time
limit
at
a
different
time.
the
negative...
the
negative
inference
points,
to
address
the
negative
inference
point,
there
are
three
reasons
why
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
draw
a
negative
inference
from
the
omission
of
the
clarifying
language
here.
first,
it
contradicts
the
presumption
that
congress
used
final
in
accordance
with
its
settled
meaning
in
the
collateral
review
context,
which
petitioner
discussed
earlier.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
it
explicates
the
meanings,
but
it
explicates
the
meanings
by
providing
the
definition
that
is
the...
is...
by
providing
an
explication
that's
consistent
with
the
background
definition
that
you
would
expect
final
to
have,
and
there's
a...
there
are
good
reasons
why
congress
would
have...
might
have
wanted
to
explicate
the...
to
explicate
it
more
carefully
in
2244.
petitioner
discussed
one,
which
is
that
2244
concerned
state
prisoners,
and
congress
might
have
been
concerned
that,
absent
clarification,
courts
might
import
the
definition
of
finality
used
by
the
state
of
conviction,
and
there
are
varying
definitions
there.
there's
not
the
uniform
definition
that
would
include
review
in
this
court.
second,
it's
possible
that
congress
might
have
been
concerned
that
the
courts
would
assume
that
the
time
limit
in
section
2244
starts
to
run
the
same
time
as
the
time
limit
in
section
2263,
which
also
concerns
state
prisoners,
state
capital
defendants
and
states
subject
to
expedited
collateral
review
proceedings,
and
so
congress--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--may
have
spelled
it
out
here.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
i...
i
don't
think
that
it
makes
a
difference.
there
are
variations
in...
in
language
like
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor,
but
it's
referring
back
to
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
under
which
the
person
is
in
custody.
the...
the
provision
2244(d)(1)
is
reproduced
in
the
gray
brief
on
page
2
to
3.
so
where
it
says
the
date
on
which
the
judgment
became
final,
it's...
it's
referring
back
to
a...
a
person
who's
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
a
state
court,
and
that
would
be
the
judgment
of
the
district
court...
i
mean,
of
the
trial
court
in...
in
that
situation,
but
fundamentally,
our
points
are
two.
one,
there's
a
background
rule,
and
the
presumption
is
generally
of...
of
what...
when
a
judgment
becomes
final
in
the
collateral
review
context,
and
it's
generally
presumed,
with
good
reason,
that
congress
legislates
against
that
background
rule
and
uses
the
terms
with
their
settled
meaning
in
that
context;
and
second,
we
know
congress
did
that
with
respect
to
state
prisoners
in
section
2244
because
they
clarified
it
there;
and
it
makes
sense
that
the
time
limitation
should
run
at
the
same
time,
because
there's
no
persuasive
reason
for
them
to
run
at
a
different
time.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
they
were
enacted
as
part
of
the...
the
same
statute,
your
honor,
but
the...
the
proposition
that
the
same
word
has
the
same
meaning,
the
same
word
becomes
final,
has
the
same
meaning
throughout
the
statute...
same
statute
would
apply
by
virtue
of
that.
so
the...
so
that
we
would
expect
that
when
congress
said,
becomes
final
in
section
22...
2255,
and
when
it
said,
became
final
in
2244,
both
referring
to
a
judgment
of
the
trial
court
convicting
the
defendant,
that
it...
it
intended
those
phrases
to
have
the
same
meaning.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
right.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
that...
that
would
be
one
possibility,
that
here
it
was
restricted--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--but
it
was
broader.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
but
it's
hard
for
me
to
conceive,
frankly,
what
the
broader--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--understanding
of
finality
is,
your
honor.
i
do
think
that...
that
not
every
time
that...
that
congress
uses
the
different
language
to...
that's
more
amplified
and
clarifying,
does
that...
that
mean
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that
the
words...
and
the
court
does
not
generally...
does
not
generally
apply
the
negative
inference,
the
russello
presumption
to
draw
the
conclusion
that
the...
that
identical
phrases
have...
have
different
meaning.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that...
that
would
be--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that
would
be
parallel
to
russello
and
parallel
to
some
other
cases
where
there's
been
additional
limiting
language,
and
the
court
has
said
therefore,
the...
we
won't
read
that
limit
into
the
earlier
language,
but
in
those
cases
also
what
bears
note
is
that
the
word
that
was
limited
later
on,
here
the
word
becomes...
the
phrase
becomes
final,
was
by
the
court,
in
those
cases,
given
its
ordinary
meaning,
what
you
would
expect,
apart
from
the
russello
presumption.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
and
here--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
yes,
your
honor,
and
there
isn't...
there
isn't
an
ordinary
meaning
across
the
board
in
every
context,
but
here
we
have
a...
a
narrow
context
in
which
congress
has
acted
in
the
collateral
review
context,
in
particular
in
the
commencement
of
collateral
review,
and
in
this
court's
cases,
in
the
collateral
review
context,
particularly
delineating
when
direct
review
ends
and
collateral
review
begins,
the
court
has
used
repeatedly,
over
30
years
before
enactment
of
aedpa,
the...
this
established
definition
of
finality,
and
there's...
there's
no
reason
why
congress
would
have
departed
from
that
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
submit.
