justice
ruth
bader

so
you
are
saying
that
in
the...
within
2244(d)(1),
those
words
are
surplusage,
they
don't
do
anything,
that...
the...
that
2244
would
mean
the
same
thing
if
there
were
a
period
after
"became
final".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
on
the
issuance
of
a
mandate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
surely
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
seem
to
take
only
one
part
of
the
definition,
because
2244
says,
on
direct
review,
or
the
expiration,
but
you
seem
to
accept
that
2255
does
encompass
direct
review.
that
is,
if
someone
actually
files
a
petition
for
cert,
then
the
finality
rule
would
not
kick
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
makes
sense--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
de
bruin,
i'd
like
to
take
you
back
to
that
word,
mandate,
because
finality
means
different
things
in
different
contexts.
the
most
basic
finality
rule
is
when
the
district
court
disassociates
itself
from
the
case,
and
then
the
case
is
lodged
on
appeal.
it's
final
for,
say,
preclusion
purposes
at
that
point.
this
court
dates
from,
not
from
the
mandate
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
take,
for
example,
our
rule
on
cert.
doesn't
it
run
from
the
entry
of
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals,
not
from
the
later
time
when
a
mandate
is
issued?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
where
do
you
make
up
the
mandate
rule
as
a
general
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
right
that
our
rules
don't
refer
to
the
mandate
date
at
all,
that
it's
always
the
entry
of
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
admit
that
for
one
part
of
that
clause,
congress
didn't
mean
any
different.
the...
if
there
is
a
petition
filed,
if
there
is,
in
fact,
a
cert
petition
filed,
then
state
and
federal
prisoners
got
treated
alike,
so
it's
the...
the
only
place,
as
i
understand
it,
where
you're
saying
there's
a
difference
is
whether
the
time
for
filing
a
petition
counts
even
when
the...
there...
no
petition
is
filed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
under
your
reading,
it
might
be
that
the
judgment
becomes
final,
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
becomes
final
when
the
mandate
comes
down,
even
though
the
petitioner
has
filed
a
cert
petition.
it
could
mean
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
general
understanding
is
that
when
you
file
a
cert
petition,
that
the
finality
is
suspended
until
that
petition
is
disposed
of?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
isn't
clear
on
the
point
that
i
asked
you
about,
because
i
thought
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
yes,
if
you
actually
file
your
petition
for
cert,
then
the
time
doesn't
run
until
the
petition
is
disposed
of.
i
thought...
you...
you
said
that's
ambiguous,
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
terms
of
confusing
things,
if
we
were
to
take
that
view
of
it,
it
would,
because
everybody
assumes,
well,
you
file
your
cert
petition,
then
it's
on
hold
until--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
first
case
is
number
01-1500
clay
against
united
states.
a
motion
by
a
federal
prisoner
propose
conviction
release
is
subject
to
a
one
year
time
limitation
that
generally
runs
from
the
date
on
which
the
judgment
of
conviction
becomes
final.
this
case
concerns
the
starting
date
for
the
one
year
limitation.
it
presents
a
narrow
but
recurring
question
on
which
courts
of
appeals
have
divided.
when
a
defendant
and
a
federal
prosecution
takes
an
unsuccessful
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
conviction
but
does
not
next
seek
this
court's
review
by
petitioning
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
on
what
date
does
the
judgment
becomes
final
for
post
conviction
release
purpose,
is
the
critical
date,
the
one
in
which
the
appellate
court
issues
its
mandate
or
does
finality
instead
attached
on
the
date
ordinarily
69
days
later
when
the
time
for
filing
a
petition
for
certiorari
expires.
in
accord
with
this
court’s
consistence
understanding
of
finality
in
the
context
of
collateral
review
and
the
weight
of
lower
court
authority,
we
reject
the
issuance
of
appellate
court
mandate
as
the
triggering
date.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
considered
the
mandate
date
crucial
so
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
that
court
for
the
purposes
starting
the
clock
on
the
one
year
limitation
period
we
hold
a
judgment
of
conviction
becomes
final
when
the
time
expires
for
filing
of
petition
for
certiorari
contesting
the
appellate
court's
affirmation
of
the
conviction.
under
that
holding,
the
petitioning
prisoner’s
motion
for
postconviction
relief
appears
to
be
timely.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
