justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
their...
amicus
wrote,
you
know,
a
pretty
good
argument
on
that
side,
and
i
thought
one
of
his
better
points,
which
is
that
if
we're
looking
at
the...
the
1-year
limitation
from
a
person
in
state
proceedings,
what
it
says
is,
it
runs
from
the
latest
of
the
date
on
which
judgment
became
final
by
the
conclusion
of
direct
review,
or
the
expiration
of
time
for
seeking
such
review;
and
then
when
you
look
to
the
parallel
for
somebody
in
federal
proceedings,
it
says
it
becomes
final
from
the
date
on
which
the
judgment
of
conviction
becomes
final.
in
other
words,
they
use
the
first
half
of
the
sentence,
doesn't
use
the
sentence...
the
second;
and
in...
in
the
state
proceeding
it
has
two,
and
here
it
has
one,
and
he
says
you
have
to
give
some
meaning
to
that
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
it
doesn't,
see,
because
you
have
became
final
by
the
conclusion
of
direct
review,
and
then
we
have
the
date
on
which
judgment
of
conviction
became
final,
and
he's
saying
that
he
would
interpret
it
so
they
mean
the
same
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
would
also...
what...
they...
they
also...
the
government
gave
meaning
to
the...
gave
meaning
to
the
difference
by
saying,
even
if
you're
right
about
that,
becomes
final,
becomes
final
includes
expiration
of
time.
that's
their
argument.
and
as
to
the
first
thing,
by
direct
review,
that
includes
expiration
of
time,
too.
they
just
put
it
in
to
make
sure
it
was
not
the
habeas
route
in
the
states,
and
then
they
put
the
second
clause
in
really
to
save
federal
judges
from
being
confused
about
what
happens
in
the
california
court
of
appeals,
what
happens
in
the
lower
inter...
intermediate
state
courts
to
make
sure
that...
that
this
ordinary
federal
situation
was
seen
as
applying
to
cases
as
they
wend
their
way
up
through
the
state
court
system,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
that's...
that
was...
i
heard
that
being
given,
in
any
case.
are
you
following?
was
i
clear
enough?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
if,
in
fact,
you
could
read
it,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
which
i
think
maybe
you
could,
or
as
the
way
the
sg
suggested
for
the
sake
of
argument,
is
there
any
argument
that
you
shouldn't?
i
mean,
it
sounds
simple,
clear,
uniform;
everybody'd
understand
it.
is
there
any
reason
not
to
read
it
that
way
if
the
language
permits
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
then
you're
answering
my
question,
no.
you're
saying,
there
is
no
reason
not
to
read
it
that
way
if
you
could,
with
the
language,
but
the
language
doesn't
permit
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
your
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
take
it
as
a
no,
that
if
it
did
permit
it,
there
isn't
any
good
reason.
