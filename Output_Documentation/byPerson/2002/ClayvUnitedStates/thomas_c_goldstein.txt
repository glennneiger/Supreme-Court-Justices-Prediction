mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
paragraph
6
of
section
2255
provides
that,
quote,
a
1-year
period
of
limitation
shall
apply
to
a
motion
under
this
section.
the
limitation
period
shall
run
from
the
latest
of...
and
it
identifies
four
events,
the
first
of
which
is,
quote,
the
date
on
which
the
judgment
of
conviction
became
final.
congress
did
not
define
or
otherwise
explicate
when
the
judgment
becomes
final
in
that
provision,
and
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
that,
given
that
final
can
mean
many
different
things
in
different
contexts,
when
does
it...
judgment
become
final
here?
petitioner
agrees
with
the
clear
majority
of
circuits
and
the
united
states
that
the
judgment
becomes
final
upon
the
conclusion
of
direct
review
or
the
expiration
of
time
for
seeking
such
review.
as
applied
to
this
case,
petitioner's
time
to
seek
2255
relief
began
to
run
when
his
time
to
seek
certiorari
in
this
court
expired.
congress
most
likely
intended
that
interpretation
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
is
the
one
that
this
court
has
consistently
used
in
the
most
analogous
context,
and
that
is
the
dividing
line
between
direct
and
collateral
review;
and,
second--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--not
merely
retro--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--those
included,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
also
cases
like
barefoot
versus
estelle,
dealing
with
the
presumption
of
correctness,
and
also
bell
versus
maryland,
which
addresses
the
question
of
when
a
statute
is
repealed,
when
does
that
repeal
affect...
what...
what
convictions
does
it
affect?
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
is,
in
effect,
our
point.
those...
most
of
those
contexts,
however,
do
deal
with
the
dividing
line
between
direct
and
collateral
review.
the
amicus
quite
rightly
points
out
that
there
are
other
meanings
of
final.
we
do
believe,
however,
that
they
don't...
they
aren't
as
close
as
this
one,
and
they
aren't
the
one
that
congress
most
naturally
looked
to,
and
since
congress
didn't
tell
this
court
what
it
meant,
you
would
look
to
the
dividing
line
between
direct
and
collateral
review,
because
that's
the
point
of
this
provision
in
section
2255.
i
mentioned
there
was
a
second
reason
that
i'll
come
to,
and
that
is
that
the...
the
minority
rule
doesn't
work
textually
and
would
produce
anomalous
results.
the...
as
i
mentioned,
the
court
has
picked
up
the
notion
of
final...
the
judgment
of
conviction
becoming
final,
and
that
language
appears
almost
verbatim
in
linkletter,
in
contexts
like
teague,
barefoot,
and
bell.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
the
point
still
would
favor
us.
you're
absolutely
right,
because
although
the
court
has
changed
the
line
for
retroactivity
and
changed
the
test,
it
has
never
changed
the
definition
of
what
is
final,
and
so
for
40
years
plus
the
court
has
consistently
included
the
time
to
seek
certiorari,
and
that's
a
perfectly
sensible
result,
as
it
would
be
applied
in
this
case.
the...
the
minority
rule,
by
contrast,
would
produce
anomalous
results.
it
would
mean,
for
example,
that
in
the
couple
of
months
after
the
mandate
issues
in
the
court
of
appeals,
a
judgment
of
conviction
would
be
both
final
and
non-final
at
the
same
time,
because
you
wouldn't...
although
the
statute
refers
to
the
judgment
of
conviction
becoming
final,
you
wouldn't
actually
know
at
that
point.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
understand.
justice
breyer,
that
is
exactly
what
has
caused
the
fourth
and
seventh
circuits
to
scratch
their
head.
it's
a
conceivable
inference.
we
don't
dispute
that.
of
course,
the
majority
of
courts
have
applied
another
canon
of
construction
here,
and
that
is
that
when
congress
uses
the
same
phrase
in
a
statute,
it's
interpreted
generally,
absent
some
strong
contrary
indication,
to
have
the
same
meaning.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
ah,
but
he
wouldn't,
and
here's
the
reason,
and
let...
let
me
just
take
you
very
carefully
through
this,
and
for
anyone
who
wants
to
look
it
up,
it's
the
blue
brief
on
page
1
would
be
the
different
statutory
provisions.
2255
says,
the
limitation
period
shall
run
from
the
latest
of
the
date
on
which
the
judgment
of
conviction
became
final.
according
to
the
amicus,
that
means
the
date
on
which
the
mandate
issues.
2244(d)(1)
says...
has
the...
has
that,
and
it
has
some
more,
and
that's
your
point.
the
limitation
period
shall
run
from
the
latest
of
the
date
on
which
the
judgment
became
final,
and
then
he
gives
that...
that
same
phrase,
judgment
became
final,
a
different
meaning
in
the
same
statute.
he
reads
that
to
mean
either
review
in
this
court,
or
the
expiration
of
time
to
seek
cert,
so
it
does...
it
would
have
actually
a...
that
phrase,
judgment
became
final,
would
have
a
different
meaning
in
22--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
right,
so
what
we
have,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
2244,
congress
explicates
a
phrase.
2255,
it
doesn't
explicate
it
at
all,
and
our--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
ginsburg,
it
is
correct
that
we
think
it
would
mean
the
same
thing
even
if
it
weren't
there,
but
it's
not
surplusage.
it
does
have
a
role,
and
so
i
have
several
reasons
to
articulate
to
the
court
why
there's
no
negative
pregnant...
our
view
is,
and
this
court
has
said,
not
every
silence
is
pregnant.
what
we
have
in
2255
is
silent.
my
point,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
inference
that
the
minority
of
courts
draw,
that
congress
was
doing
something
special
in
2244,
and
therefore
impliedly
didn't
intend
to
do
the
same
thing
in
2255,
is
not
correct,
and
i
have
several
points.
the
first
one
goes
to
yours,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
is,
it's
reasonable
for
this
court
to
ask,
okay,
why
did
it
put
it
in
2244
and
it
didn't
put
it
in
2255?
it
would
have
been
easier,
obviously,
if
it
had
put
it
in
2255.
the
reason
we
think
they
put
it
in
2244
is
not
to
specify
which
among
the
federal
interpretations
of
"judgment
becomes
final"
applies,
but
to
say
that
it's
the
federal
one,
not
the
state
one.
that's
the
real
difference
of
force
between
2244
instead
of
2255.
2244
cases
come
out
of
the
state
courts,
and
state
courts
define
finality
differently,
and
so
what
congress
did
there
in
44
was
make
quite
clear
that
they
were
applying
the
federal
rule.
that
was
very
important
in
particular,
because
state
proceedings
have
the
added
complication
of
not
just
state
direct
review,
but
state
post-conviction
review,
and
so
federal
habeas
courts
could
be
terribly
confused
on
when
the
judgment
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
is
our
point,
and
that
is
that
congress
really
needed
to
do
a
better...
a
very
good
job,
as...
as
good
as
they
did
in
aedpa
in
any
context,
but
they
needed
to
do
a
good
job
in
telling
federal
habeas
cases
in
the
20...
courts
in
the
2244
context
when
the
judgment
of
conviction
became
final,
because
if
20--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
kennedy,
this
is
the
second
point
on
the
question
of
do...
does
this
court
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
presence
in
24...
excuse
me,
44
but
not
55
creates
a
negative
inference,
the
sort
of
russello
presumption,
and
i
agree
with
you
that
it
would
rest
on
a
view
that
this
interpretation
in
44(d)(1)
is
unusual,
and
our
point
is
that
it's
not
unusual.
you
are
correct
that
the...
the...
as
they
said
in
melconian,
for
example,
that
the
term
of
art,
final
judgment,
does
generally
mean
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
but
everyone
agrees
that
that's
not
the
interpretation
here.
in
fact,
it's
very
clear
that
the...
the
phrase
here,
if
i
could
again
take
you
back
to...
take
you
back
to
it
in
2255,
is
judgment
of
conviction
becomes
final.
that
phrase,
judgment
of
conviction,
picks
up
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
32.
judgment
of
conviction
includes
the
conviction,
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
the
sentence,
and
it
is
by
necessity
already
final
and
appealable.
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
the
baseline
rule
is
final
judgment
in
the
sense
of
a
district
court,
that
would
mean
in
the
2255
context
that,
although
your...
your
direct
appeal
could
be
sitting
here
in
the
seventh
circuit
for
2
years,
after
the
first
year,
you
need
to
be
back
in
the
district
court
on
2255,
because
the
judgment
of
conviction
would
have
become
final
when
it
was
entered
by
the
district
court,
and
no
one
thinks
that's
sensible.
in
fact,
the...
the
notes
to
rule
5
of
the...
of
the
2255
rules
make
quite
clear
you're
not
supposed
to
be
in
on
your
2255
until
the
direct
review
process
is
over,
so
that...
my
point
was
that
the...
what
you're
describing
as
the
normal
background
rule
of
when
a
judgment
of
conviction
becomes
final
actually
describes
the
term
"final
judgment",
which
couldn't
apply
here.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
in
this...
in...
in
our
view,
under
2255,
mr.
chief
justice,
or--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it...
it
does
not
become
final,
in
our
view.
what
happens
is,
if
you
did
not
appeal,
it
would...
the
judgment
of
conviction
would
become
final
after
the
10
days--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
mr....
justice
kennedy,
i
do
agree
with
you
that
that's
the
amicus's
view.
our
point
is
that
it
doesn't
pick
up
what
you're
describing
as
the
normal
rule
of
final
judgment.
that
wouldn't
be
the
normal
process.
our
point
is
that
the
most--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
kennedy,
as
a
matter
of...
for
example,
melconian,
if
we
go
back
to
what
this
court
has
described
as
the
normal
background
understanding,
the
normal
background
understanding
is
that
just
when
it's
entered
by
the
district
court;
but
if,
again
if
i
could
come
back
to
my
basic
point,
and
that
is,
we
all
agree
final
can
mean
a
lot
of
things,
and
the
closest
one,
it
seems
perfectly
clear,
is
the
one
that
divides
direct
and
collateral
review,
because
that's
what
this
provision
does.
i
won't
deny
to
you,
justice
kennedy,
that
it
could
mean
different
things.
but
no
one...
and
my
third
point
i
wanted
to
make,
justice
ginsburg,
about
why
you
shouldn't
draw
negative
inferences,
nobody's
got
a
good
reason.
nobody's
got
a
reason
to
think
that
congress
would
have
wanted
this
time
to
be
available
to
state
prisoners,
but
not
to
federal
prisoners.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
could
address
first
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
background
understanding
of
when
a
judgment
of
conviction
becomes
final,
because
conceivably
that
would
give
rise
to
the
negative
inference
that
congress
was
doing
something
special
in
2244
that
it
didn't
intend
in
2255.
the
amicus
points
the
court
to
the
pre-amendment
rule
33,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
play
out
exactly
what
finality
means
there,
because
in
the
pre-amendment
rule
33,
there
wasn't
agreement
on
whether
or
not
finality
attaches
upon
the
issuance
of
a
mandate.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
before
the
1998
amendment,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
apologize,
to
criminal
procedure.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
do
apologize.
under...
before
it
was
amended,
some
courts
said
it
was
the
judgment.
some
courts
said
it
was
the
mandate.
that's
discussed
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
to
the
amendment.
in
addition,
most
things
under
rule
33,
those
other
than
newly
discovered
evidence,
ran
from
the
entry
of
the
judgment
in
the
district
court,
and
perhaps
most
important
of
all,
it's
settled
under
rule
33,
and
this
is
the
cook
case
from
the
ninth
circuit
that's
cited
in
the
amicus
brief,
that
under
rule
33
if
a
cert
petition
was
filed,
that
didn't
stop
the
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
there
were
no
contrary
cases,
you're
quite
right.
this
court
never
passed
on
it,
and
there's
no
contrary
authority.
and
so
my
point
is
this.
even
under
rule
33,
it
could
mean
a
lot
of
different
things,
and
i
do
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
among
all
the
analogies,
the
closest
one
is
this
court's
collateral
review
precedents.
i
do
want
to
pick
up
on
justice
breyer's
and...
and
the
chief
justice's
question
about,
well,
didn't
they
explicate
something
in
2244
that
they
didn't
in
2255,
and
if
i
could
give
a
contrary...
give
a
hypothetical
where
i
think
that
reasoning
would
apply,
if
2255
said,
when
the
judgment
of
conviction
becomes
final
by
the
expiration
of
direct...
by
the
conclusion
of
direct
review,
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
2255
petitioner
to
say,
"and
that
includes
the
time
for
seeking
cert.
"
because
then
you
would
have
a
real
contrast
with
2244.
you
would
have
one
of
the
phrases
in
55,
but
both
in
44,
and
there
you
could
have
a
genuine
inference.
here
we
don't
have
anything,
and
my
point
is
that
this
silence
is
not
pregnant.
you
don't
draw
the
inference
that
congress
meant
nothing
at
all,
or
that
congress
meant...
as
justice
scalia
points
out,
an
even
narrower
universe.
the
final
point
i
want
to
make
is
about--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
no,
his...
the
amicus's
point
would
have
to
be
that
2255
means
some
subset,
or
some
smaller
interpretation,
or
some
shorter
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
apologize.
you're
quite
right.
justice
scalia's
point
is
that
look,
if
you
use
the
word
by,
it
could
either
mean
it's
explicating
things,
or
more
naturally
it
means,
we've
picked
a
subset,
and
so
you
don't
have
the
subset
here.
that's
russello.
interest
versus
interest
in
an
enterprise.
interest
in
an
enterprise
is
a...
a
smaller
part
of
the
bigger
ball.
the
final
point
is
about
policy
reasons.
there
really
is
no
reason
congress
would
have
intended
this
period
of
time,
the
time
when
you
could
have
sought
cert
but
didn't,
to
be
available
to
a
state
prisoner
versus
a...
a
federal
prisoner.
there's
no
explanation
given
by
amicus
that
makes
any
sense.
for
example,
gvrs
apply
only
when
a
cert
petition
is
filed.
thank
you.
