unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
thought
they
would
intend
it
in
order
to
show
special
respect
for
the
processes
of
the
state,
so
that
a
state
has
completely
exhausted
all
of
its
procedures
for
determining
what
the
law
ought
to
be--
unknown
speaker
--before
they're
disrupted
by
a
federal
judgment.
unknown
speaker
do
you--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
that
in
2255
congress
used
the
phrase,
judgment
of
conviction,
and
in
2244(d)(1)
it
simply
used
the
word,
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
usually
variations
in
language
mean
variations
in
meaning.
unknown
speaker
i
wouldn't
think
that.
i
would...
i
would
think
that
where
you
say,
on
the
one
hand,
where
it
becomes
final
by
(a)
or
(b),
and
elsewhere
you
simply
say,
where
it
becomes
final--
unknown
speaker
--i
would
think
that
the
latter
means,
even
if
it
becomes
final
in
some
other
fashion.
now,
that
happens
not...
that
happens
not
to
help
the
respondent
here.
unknown
speaker
but
i...
but
i
do
think
that
that's
the
more
natural--
unknown
speaker
--don't
you
think
that's
the
more
natural--
unknown
speaker
--that's
right,
broader.
unknown
speaker
what
the
broader
would
be.
unknown
speaker
not
necessarily.
unknown
speaker
oh,
if...
if
you
applied
the
russello
presumption
here,
you...
you
would
be
applying
the
presumption
that
i
just
described,
namely
in...
in
one
section,
it
limited
it,
in...
in
the
other
section,
it
didn't
limit
it
at
all.
you'd
think
the
latter
section
would
be
broader,
not
narrower.
unknown
speaker
that's...
that's
what
russello
said.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
i--
unknown
speaker
--that
gets
you
into
the
argument
of
whether
there
is
an
ordinary
meaning
of
final.
unknown
speaker
let's...
let's
review
the
russello
presumption.
russello
had
an
earlier
section
where
the
more
general
word
was
limited.
what...
what
was
the...
what
was
the...
the...
what
was
the
general
word
involved
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
any...
any
interest
acquired.
that's
what
the
later
provision
said,
and
the
earlier
provision
said,
any
interest
in
the
enterprise
acquired.
unknown
speaker
okay,
and...
and
what
russello
said
is,
where
you
have
a
limitation
in
the
earlier
one,
an
interest
in
any
enterprise,
and
then
the
later
one
just
says,
any
interest,
we
assume
that
any
interest
is
broader.
it's
not
limited
by,
in
any
enterprise.
now,
if
you
apply...
and
i
think
that's
entirely
reasonable,
but
if
you
apply
that
same
principle
here,
what
it
comes
to
is
that
where
in
the
early
one
it
says
final
by
reason
of
(a)
and
(b),
and
in
the
later
one,
it
just
says,
becomes
final,
you
would
think
the
later
one
would...
would
include
(a),
(b),
and
maybe
(c),
(d),
(e),
but
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
narrower
than
the
earlier
one,
which
is
what
you're
insisting
it
is.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
russello
cuts
exactly
against
your
position,
rather
than
for
it.
unknown
speaker
but
aren't
you
picking
one
of
the
two
means
of
finality
that's
set
forth
in
the
earlier
provision?
you're
saying
in
the
later
provision
it
only
means
one
of
those
two.
that's
not
russello
at
all.
that's
the
opposite
of
russello.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
think
what
you'd
have
to
say
is,
it
means
those
two
perhaps
plus
some
others.
unknown
speaker
if
you...
if
you--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
--i
suppose
you
could
answer
justice
scalia
by
saying
that
these
are
exceptions
to
the
ordinary
rule
of
finality,
although
the
statute
doesn't
quite
read
that
way.
they're...
they...
or
they
are
special
extensions--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
ordinary
rule
of
finality.
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
case
would
be
persuasive
if,
indeed,
there
was
a
generally
understood
meaning
of
finality,
and...
and
that's
the
part
of
your
brief
i
focused
on,
and
i
just
don't
think
you
carry
the
day.
i
just
think,
as
justice
ginsburg
points
out,
it
means
a
lot
of
different
things.
so
once
that's
the
case,
all
you
have
to
rely
upon
is
this
principle
that...
that
where...
where
a
thing
is
said
two
different
ways
in
a
statute,
there
must
be
a
reason.
you
have
to
give
them
different
meaning.
that
isn't
an
absolute
principle,
and
it...
it
has
all
sorts
of
exceptions.
i
mean,
it...
it
just
depends.
for
example,
if
you
say,
from
the
day
of
entry
of
judgment
in
one
section
of
the
statute,
and
in
another
section
of
the
statute
it
reads,
from
the
day
judgment
was
entered,
do
you
really
think
you
have
to
give
different
meaning
to
those
two
formulations?
of
course
not.
it
all
depends
on
what...
what
the
other
factors
involved
are,
and
here--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
see
any
other
factor,
unless
you
show
that
finality
has
a
normal
meaning,
which...
so
that
the
earlier
provision
is
giving
it
some
peculiar
meaning.
that...
that
would
be
persuasive--
unknown
speaker
--but...
but
i
don't
think
you
carry
the
day
on
that
point.
unknown
speaker
mr.
de
bruin,
i
think
i
understand
your
argument
based
on
the
different
wording,
but...
i
think
this
question
was
asked
before,
too:
is
there
any
reason
why
congress
might
want
to
give
federal
post-conviction
petitioners
less
time
than
state
post-conviction
petitioners?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
it's
settled.
it's
settled
in
the
ninth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
his
point
was
it
was
an
even
broader
universe.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
justice
scalia's--
