no,
but
do
you
challenge
the
fact
that
they
are
giving
the
preference?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
serious
that
you
think
there
is
a
serious
question
about
that?
that
we
cannot
take
that
green
brief
as
a
representation
of
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
issue
as
i
understand
it
is
not
whether
without
preferences
there
can
be
a
military
academy
population
with
some
minorities,
the
question
is
whether
without
the...
the
weighting
of
race
that
they
do
in
fact
give,
they
can
have
an
adequate
number
of
minorities
in
the
academies
to
furnish
ultimately
a
reasonable
number
of
minorities
in
the
officer
corps,
that's
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
more
than
what
would
happen
if
they
did
nothing?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
believe
that
that
would
be
an
adequate...
at
least
means
of
experimenting
here...
take
it
as
an
alternative?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
taking
for
example
economic
disadvantage?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
seriously
believe
that
that
would
be
anything
but
a
surrogate
to
race?
it
would
take
the
word
race
out
of
the
categorization
of
the
label
that
we
put
on
it,
but
do
you
believe
it
would
function
in
a
different
way
but
as
a
surreptitious
approach
to
race?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
it
would?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
it
would?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
object...
but
the
object
i
would
have
assumed
given
the
dialogue,
the
object
is
to
increase
the
racial
number
of
the
percentage
of
minorities.
if
that
is
the
object,
than
whatever
it
is,
it's
not
a
race
neutral
measure.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you...
what
do
you
think
is
the...
is
the
principal
race
neutral
means,
that
the
academy
should
use?
justice
david
h.
souter
without
criticizing
necessarily
what
they're
doing
now,
what
would
be
the...
in
your
judgment,
the
best
race
neutral
way
for
them
to
go
about
reaching
your
objective?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no.
i
realize
your
position.
but
specifically,
which...
which
of
the
race
neutral
suggestions
that
have
been
considered
do
you
think
would
be,
you
know,
most
adaptable
to
the
academy
situation?
justice
david
h.
souter
recruiting
with
an
objective
of
minority
students?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
my
question
is,
if
they
don't
do
it
with
a
racial
objective,
how
does
the
recruiting
respond
to
the
position
taken
in...
in
mr.
phillips's
brief
that
without
the
kind
of...
of
racial
weighting
and
admissions
that
is
given
now,
they
simply
will
not
reach
a...
a...
a
substantial
number
of...
or
be
able
to
attain
a
substantial
number
of
minority
slots
in
the
class?
justice
david
h.
souter
general,
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that
the
only
reason
accomplishes
it
is
because
it
depends
on
segregation
at
the
lower
level
of
the
schools,
otherwise
it
would
not
accomplish
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the...
what
the...
what...
what
justice
powell
and
the
five
who
agreed
or
the
four
who
agreed
on
the
harvard
plan
were
getting
at
was
that
there
is
a
permissible
zone
between
a
purely
token
number
and
a
quota
or
a
set
aside
and
you
can
shoot
for
something
in
that
zone?
is
that
a
fair--
