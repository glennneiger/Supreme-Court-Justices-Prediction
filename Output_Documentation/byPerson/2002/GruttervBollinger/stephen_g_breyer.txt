stephen
g.

fine.
if
you
can
use
race
as
a
criterion
for
spending
money,
i
take
it
one
argument
on
the
other
side,
which
i'd
like
you
to
address,
is
that
we
live
in
a
world
where
more
than
than
half
of
all
the
minority...
really
75
percent
of
black
students
below
the
college
level
are
at
schools
that
are
more
than
50
percent
minority.
and
85
percent
of
those
schools
are
in
areas
of
poverty.
and
many
among
other
things
that
they
tell
us
on
the
other
side
is
that
many
people
feel
in
the
schools,
the
universities,
that
the
way...
the
only
way
to
break
this
cycle
is
to
have
a
leadership
that
is
diverse.
and
to
have
a
leadership
across
the
country
that
is
diverse,
you
have
to
train
a
diverse
student
body
for
law,
for
the
military,
for
business,
for
all
the
other
positions
in
this
country
that
will
allow
us
to
have
a
diverse
leadership
in
a
country
that
is
diverse.
now,
you're
familiar
with
that
argument.
but
if
it
is
reasonable
to
use
race
as
a
criterion,
as
a
plus
for
spending
money,
why
isn't
it
also
reasonable
to
use
it
as
a
plus
to
see
that...
to
obtain
that
set
of
objectives
that
i've
tried
to
summarize
in
a
second
that
you're
very
familiar
with.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
that
the
injury
is
more
severe
to
the
white
person
who
doesn't
get
in
when
that
white
person
doesn't
get
in
because
she's
not
an
athlete
or
he's
not
a...
he's
not
an
alumnus
or
he's
not
any
of
the
other
things
that
fits
within
these
other
criteria?
what
is
the
difference
there
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
legal
conclusion.
but
the
reason
if
i
thought,
for
example,
that
there
is
a
difference
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
between
a
system
that
says
to
the
discriminated-against
people,
the
law
does
not
respect
you,
and
a
system
that
says
the
law
does
respect
you,
but
we
are
trying
to
help
some
others,
suppose
i
thought
that
that
is
a
sound
legal
distinction
as
reflected
in
this
court's
cases,
you
would
reply
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
they
do
is
they
use
race.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
but
they
have
a
reason
for
it.
the
reason
for
it
is
they
want
to
produce
a
diverse
class
and
the
reason
they
want
to
do
that,
using
it
as
a
plus,
they
say,
is
to
do
the
things
i
said
before.
they
think
it
breaks
down
stereotypes
within
the
class.
they
think
it's
educationally
beneficial.
they
think
it
supplies
a
legal
profession
that
will
be
diverse
and
they
think
a
legal
profession
like
business
and
the
military
that
is
diverse
is
good
for
america
from
a
civics
point
of
view,
et
cetera,
breaks
the
cycle.
those
are
the
arguments
which
you
well
know.
so
what
is
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
what
they
say.
they
say
they're
not
using
race
as
a
surrogate
for
anything,
because
if
you
have
a
person
who
went
to
exeter
who's
very
rich
and
happens
to
be
black
and
is
a
conservative
republican,
it's
great
for
the
class
to
know
that,
too.
and
that's
why
they
want
a
certain
number.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
the
texas
plan
constitutional?
if
it's
designed
solely
in
order
to
have
a
diverse
mix
in
the
colleges
they
take
10
percent,
but
their
motive
stated
and
their
purpose
is
to
have
diversity
in
the
college?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
justice
powell's
opinion
in
bakke
can
be
viewed
as,
yes,
you
can
used
race
as
a
plus
factor,
where
the
program
is
not
against
anyone,
but
you
cannot
go
too
far,
and
it
says
individualized
consideration
is
necessary
there,
what
in
your
opinion
would
be
going
too
far,
other
than
quotas?
how
would
this
be
maintained
within
limits?
