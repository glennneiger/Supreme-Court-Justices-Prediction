justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
you...
i
mean,
a
university
or
a
law
school
is
faced
with
a
serious
problem
when
it's
one
that
gets
thousands
of
applications
for
just
a
few
slots.
where
it
has
to
be
selective.
and
inherent
in
that
setting
is
making
choices
about
what
students
to
admit.
so
you
have
an
element
here
that
suggests
that
there
are
many
reasons
why
a
particular
student
would
be
admitted
or
not.
and
a
lot
of
factors
go
into
it.
so
how
do
you
single
this
out
and
how
are
we
certain
that
there's
an
injury
to
your
client
that
she
wouldn't
have
experienced
for
other
reasons?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
say
that's
not...
it
can't
be
a
factor
at
all.
is
that
it?
is
that
your
position
that
it
cannot
be
one
of
many
factors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
have
some...
some
precedents
out
there
that
you
have
to
come
to
grips
with,
because
the
court
obviously
has
upheld
the
use
of
race
in
making
selections
or
choices
in
certain
contexts,
for
instance,
to
remedy
prior
to
discrimination
in
other
contexts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
you
are
speaking
in
absolutes
and
it
isn't
quite
that.
i
think
we
have
given
recognition
to
the
use
of
race
in
a
variety
of
settings.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
olson,
do
you...
do
you
agree
with
the
articulated
proposal
of
justice
powell
in
the
bakke
case
of
using
race
as
a
plus
factor
as
he...
as
he
saw
the
use
of
it.
do
you
disagree
with
that
approach?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
think
it
commanded
a
court.
i'm
just
asking
if
you
agreed
with
that
approach.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
mahoney
may
i
shift
focus
away
from
this
to
another
point
before
you're
finished,
that
i...
i
am
concerned
about.
in
all
programs
which
this
court
has
upheld
in
the
area
of...
you
want
to
label
it
affirm
tisk,
there's
been
a
fixed
time
period
within
which
it
would
operate.
you
could
see
at
the
end...
an
end
to
it,
there
is
none
in
this,
is
there?
how
do
we
deal
with
that
aspect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
approved
any
other
affirm
tisk
program
with
such
a
vague
distant
termination
base?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
know
what's
happened
in
the
law
schools
in
california
since
it
was
determined
by
state
law
affirm
tisk?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
are
other
law
schools
in
california,
too,
are
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
have
some
good
law
schools,
you
have
ucla,
you
have
usc?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sc
is
private?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
ucla?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
university
of
michigan
law
school
strives
to
assemble
a
highly
capable
diverse
student
body
by
focusing
on
academic
ability
as
well
as
on
each
applicant's
talents,
experiences,
and
potential.
the
law
school's
admissions
policy
does
not
define
diversity
solely
in
terms
of
race
but
it
does
reaffirm
the
law
school's
commitment
to
the
inclusion
of
african-american,
latino,
and
native-american
students
who
might
otherwise
not
be
present
in
meaningful
numbers.
petitioner
barbara
grutter
is
a
white
michigan
resident
who
was
denied
admission
to
the
law
school.
she
filed
this
suit
alleging
that
respondents
unlawfully
discriminated
against
her
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
district
court
agreed
with
petitioner
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
hold
that
the
law
school's
use
of
race
in
admissions
is
narrowly
tailored
to
further
a
compelling
state
interest
in
assembling
a
diverse
student
body.
we
last
addressed
the
use
of
race
in
university
admissions
in
the
landmark
bakke
case.
none
of
the
six
opinions
in
that
case
garnered
a
majority.
justice
powell
announcing
the
judgment
provided
a
fifth
vote
not
only
for
invalidating
the
racial
set
aside
program
at
issue
in
bakke
but
also
for
reversing
the
lower
court's
injunction
against
any
use
of
race,
whatever.
in
part
of
his
opinion
joined
by
no
other
justice,
justice
powell
concluded
that
attaining
a
diverse
student
body
was
the
only
interest
asserted
by
the
university
that
could
survive
scrutiny
since
bakke
universities
across
the
nation
have
modeled
their
admissions
programs
on
justice
powell's
views
concerning
permissible
race-conscious
admissions
policies.
courts
however
have
struggled
to
discern
whether
justice
powell's
diversity
rationale
is
binding
precedent.
we
need
not
decide
that
question
because
we
endorse
justice
powell's
views
and
in
the
context
of
higher
education,
student
body
diversity
is
a
compelling
state
interest
that
can
justify
a
narrowly
tailored
use
of
race
in
admission.
our
scrutiny
of
the
law
school's
interest
in
attaining
a
diverse
student
body
is
no
less
strict
for
taking
into
account
complex
educational
judgments
in
an
area
that
lies
primarily
within
the
university's
expertise.
the
educational
benefits
that
flow
from
student
body
diversity
are
substantiated
by
numerous
expert
studies
and
reports
showing
that
such
diversity
promotes
learning
and
better
prepares
students
for
an
increasingly
heterogenous
workforce.
for
responsible
citizenship,
and
for
the
legal
profession.
indeed,
high
ranking
retired
officer's
and
civilian
military
leaders
assert
that
a
highly
qualified,
racially
diverse
officer
corp
drawn
in
large
part
from
college
rotc
programs
is
essential
to
our
nation's
security.
moreover,
because
universities
and
law
schools
in
particular
represent
the
training
ground
for
a
large
number
of
our
nation's
leaders,
this
path
to
leadership
must
be
visibly
open
to
talented
and
qualified
individuals
of
every
race
and
ethnicity.
the
law
school's
race
admissions
program
is
also
narrowly
tailored
to
further
the
interest
we
approve
today.
the
law
school
considers
race
only
as
a
plus
in
a
particular
applicant's
file
and
gives
serious
consideration
to
all
the
ways
besides
race
that
an
applicant
might
contribute
to
a
diverse
educational
environment.
the
law
school's
pursuit
of
a
critical
mass
of
under
represented
minority
operates
neither
as
a
quota
nor
a
two
track
admission
system.
moreover,
the
law
school
engages
in
a
highly
individualized
holistic
review
of
each
applicant.
we
are
also
satisfied
that
the
law
school
sufficienty
considered
workable
race
neutral
alternatives
before
resorting
to
race-based
means
to
obtain
the
educational
benefits
of
diversity
that
the
law
school
seeks,
and
in
the
context
of
its
individualized
inquiry
into
the
possible
diversity
contributions
of
all
applicants,
the
law
school's
race-conscious
admissions
program
does
not
unduly
harm
non-minority
applicants.
now,
we
are
mindful
that
a
core
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
to
do
away
with
all
governmentally
imposed
discrimination
based
on
race.
accordingly,
race-conscious
admissions
policies
must
be
limited
in
time,
in
shrining
a
permanent
justification
for
racial
preferences
would
offend
this
fundamental
equal
protection
principle.
we
see
no
reason
to
exempt
race
conscious
admissions
program
from
the
requirement
that
all
governmental
uses
of
race
must
have
a
logical
end
point.
we
take
the
law
school
at
its
word
that
it
would
like
nothing
better
than
defined
a
race-neutral
admissions
formula
and
will
terminate
its
race-conscious
admissions
program
as
soon
as
practicable.
it
has
been
25
years
since
justice
powell
first
suggested
approval
of
the
use
of
race
to
further
an
interest
in
student
body
diversity
in
the
context
of
higher
education.
we
expect
that
25
years
from
now,
the
use
of
racial
preferences
will
no
longer
be
necessary
to
further
the
interest
that
we
approve
today.
