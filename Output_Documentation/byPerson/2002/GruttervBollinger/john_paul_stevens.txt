yes,
they
have,
if
the
brief
is
accurate
about
the
regulations,
the
academies
have
taken
a
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
but
they
are
quoting
material
that
the
academies
have
distributed,
which
indicate
they
do
give
preferences.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
challenge
the
fact...
that
that
is
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
one
question
about
the
extent
of
your
position.
there's
a
brief
applied,
i
think
it's
by
the
potawatomi
tribe.
if
michigan
had
made...
the
governor
of
michigan
many
years
ago
had
made
a
commitment
to
an
indian
tribe
to
allow
three
persons
into
the
university
of
michigan
every
year,
three
tribemen,
and
nothing
else,
would
that
be
constitutionally
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
just
one,
still
would
be
a...
that
would
exclude
an
impermissible
number
of
slots
for--
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
olson,
just
let
me
get
a
question
out
and
you
answer
it
at
your
convenience.
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
carter
phyllip's
brief.
what
is
your
view
of
the
strength
of
that
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
one
about
the
generals
and
about
the
military
academies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
suggestion
is
that
the
military
has
broader
latitude
than
the
private
university?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
pointing
to
rostker
suggests
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
olson,
i'm
not
sure
you
answered
justice
o'connor's
question.
do
you
agree
with
justice
powell's
suggestion
that
race
could
be
used
as
a
plus
in
something
like
the
harvard
program?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
answer
is
no,
you
would
not
agree
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
mahoney,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
is
really
prompted
by
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
terminal
point
in
all
of
this
point
and
we're
all
hoping
some
day
race
will
be
a
totally
irrelevant
factor
in
all
decisions,
but
one
of
your
arguments
on
the
other
side
of
your
case
is
that
there's
actually...
these
programs
actually
generate
racial
hostility
particularly
on
the
part
of
the
excluded
members.
and
that
in
turn
delays
the
ultimate
day
we
are
all
hoping
for.
what
is
your
comment
about
that?
