justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
cause
for
concern
with
your...
if
you're
the
dean
of
the
law
school
or
the
president
in
the
university
or
the
governor
of
the
state
that
minority
students,
particularly
from
the
black
and
hispanic
community
are
underrepresented
by
a
large
factor,
according
to
their...
their
share
of
the
population.
suppose
you
have
a
law
school
with
two
or
three
percent
hispanic
and...
and
black
students,
is
that
a
legitimate
concern
for
the
university
and
for
the
state
officials?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
year
after
year
after
year
there's
an
underrepresentation,
there
is
no
cause
for
the
state
or
the
government
or
its
educational
experts
to
be
concerned
whatsoever?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
a
broad
social
and
political
concern
that
there
are
not
adequate
members
of...
of
the
profession
which
is
designed
to
protect
our
rights
and
to...
and
to
promote
progress.
i
would...
i
should
think
that's
a
very
legitimate
concern
on
the
part
of
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
ask
you
this,
it's
about
the
military
brief
that
you
didn't
come
here
to
argue
about,
but
it
will
maybe
get
you
back
to
your
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
military
brief
tells
us...
the
green
brief...
that
there
are
preparatory
schools
that
the
academies
have
and
40
percent
of
the
registration
in
those
preparatory
schools
are
racial
minorities.
and
they...
suppose
the
government
does
this
and
expends
money
for
the
purpose
of
recruiting
and
helping
racial
minorities
apply
to
the
academies
and
succeed
there.
is
that
a
proper
constitutional
purpose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
allow
recruiting
targeted
at
minorities?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
disagree
with
his
use
of
the
term
diversity
as
being
a
permissible
governmental
goal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure...
in
his
brief
does
he
acknowledge
that
can
be
a
compelling
interest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
no.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
compelling
interest
that
allows
race
to
be
used.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
justice
scalia's
question
is
designed
to
put
to
you
the
fact
that
this
isn't
a
compelling
interest,
because
it's
a
choice
that
the
michigan
law
school
has
made
to
be
like
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
question
put
to
you
is
michigan
has
designed
its
school
in
a
particular
way
and
it
doesn't
have
to
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
that
brings
us
to
the
question
of
the
use
of
race,
which
is
being
used
here.
let
me
ask
you
this:
suppose
there's
a
reasonable
disagreement
as
to
whether
or
not
the
so-called
critical
mass
is,
in
fact,
a
disguised
quota,
you
would
say
it
is
not.
suppose
there's
a
reasonable
disagreement
on
that
point,
if
that's
so,
you
lose,
is
that
not
correct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
beyond
this
court's
capacity
to
say
that?
it
certainly
at
a
minimum
a
might
have
had
question
of
law
and
fact.
you're
arguing
here
that
it
isn't.
i'm
certainly...
at
least
open
the
possibility
that
we
can
disagree
with
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it's
hard
to
see
that
that's...
that's
true
here,
when
every
day
the
admission
staff
looks
to
see
what
the
numbers
are
based
on
race?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
just
have
a
daily
report
that
they
look
at
once
a
week?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
show
how
well
they're
doing
in
getting
the
so-called
critical
mass
which
is
just
a
synonym
for
a
number?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
difficult
when
it's
not
in
the
record.
i
do
have
one
more
question
on
this
quota
point.
i
don't
think
the
answer
that
you
gave
to
justice
scalia
was
in...
in
all
respects
complete.
you
said
well,
if...
if
there
were
a
program
that
no
matter
what
you
used
a
somewhat
different
phrase,
no
matter
what,
there
would
be
people
taken
regardless
of
qualifications...
that
would
be
a
quota.
suppose
the
pool
is
large
enough
so
that
you
can
find
minorities
to
fill
your
15
percent
aspiration.
why
isn't
that
a
quota
even
if
they're
qualified?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
that
was
a...
a
really
a
false...
or
an
improper
qualification
that
you
gave
to
your
answer?
