it
depends
on
what
factor
you're
talking
about,
doesn't
it?
you
accept
the
fact
that
they're
giving
preferences,
but
that
doesn't
convert
to
the
fact
that
if
they
didn't
give
preferences,
there
is
no
other
way
to
get
an
officer
corps
that
includes
some
minority
people,
does
the
brief
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
more
than
what
would
happen
if
they
did
something
else,
such
as
making
special
provision
for
all
people
of
economically
disadvantaged
background.
we
don't
know
whether
that
would
have
produced
the
same
number,
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
preparatory
schools...
do
you
concede
that
they're
only
for
minority
students?
i'm
familiar
with
those
preparatory
schools,
familiar
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
majority
of
the
people
that
attend
them
are
young
men
and
women
who
really
want
to
get
into
the
service
academies,
but
don't
have
the
grades
for
it.
and
the
service
academy
tells
them
whether
they're
black,
white
or
anything
else,
go
to
these
preparatory
schools
and
you'll
have
a
better
chance
next
time
around.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
just
for
minorities.
justice
antonin
scalia
including
at
the
point
of
giving
the
benefit
of
going
to
one
of
these
preparatory
schools.
you
wouldn't
allow
one
of
these
preparatory
schools
to
be
for
minority
only,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
general
olson,
is
race
different
from
sex
in
that
regard?
i
thought
we
have...
we
have
disapproved
using
sex
as
just
a
plus
factor?
that
is
one
factor
among
many,
but,
you
know,
when
you
get
down
to
it,
this
is...
this
person
is
a
male
and
therefore
we'll
put
that
into
the
mix
and
that'll
favor
the
person.
we've
disapproved
that
with
regard
to
sex
discrimination,
haven't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
race
discrimination
be
any
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mahoney,
i...
i
find
it
hard
to
take
seriously
the
state
of
michigan's
contention
that
racial
diversity
is
a
compelling
state
interest,
compelling
enough
to
warrant
ignoring
the
constitution's
prohibition
of
distribution
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
the
problem
is
a
problem
of
michigan's
own
creation,
that
is
to
say,
it
has
decided
to
create
an
elite
law
school,
it
is
one
of
the
best
law
schools
in
the
country.
and
there
are
few
state
law
schools
that...
that
get
to
that
level.
now,
it's
done
this
by
taking
only
the
best
students
with
the
best
grades
and
the
best
sats
or
lsats
knowing
that
the
result
of
this
will
be
to
exclude
to
a
large
degree
minorities.
it
is...
it's
not
unconstitutional
to
do
that,
because
it's...
that's
not...
not
the
purpose
of
what
michigan
did,
but
it
is
the
predictable
result.
nonetheless,
michigan
says
we
want
an
elite
law
school.
now,
considering
created
this
situation
by
making
that
decision,
it
then
turns
around
and
says,
oh,
we
have
a
compelling
state
interest
in
eliminating
this
racial
imbalance
that
ourselves
have
created.
now,
if
michigan
really
cares
enough
about
that
racial
imbalance,
why
doesn't
it
do
as
many
other
state
law
schools
do,
lower
the
standards,
not
have
a
flagship
elite
law
school,
it
solves
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
claims
it's
a
compelling
state
interest.
if
it's
important
enough
to
override
the
constitution's
prohibition
of
racial
distribution,
it
seems
to
me
it's
important
enough
to
override
michigan's
desire
to
have
a
super-duper
law
school?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
did
bakke
hold
that
the
harvard
plan
was
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
adopted
by...
by
a
state
institution?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
held
that
it
was
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
didn't
even...
we
didn't
even
have
the
details
of
the
harvard
plan
before
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
did...
did
the
court
know
what...
what
social
scientists
have
later
pointed
out
and
many
people
knew
before
it
that
when
the
harvard
plan
was
originally
adopted,
its
purpose
was
to
achieve
diversity
by
reducing
the
number
of
jewish
students
from
new
york
that
were...
that
were...
that
were
getting
into
harvard
on
the
basis
of
merit
alone?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
that
conform
up
in
the
course
of
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
today,
i'm
sure.
but...
but...
but
that
was
its
origin.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
too
many
of
any
race?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
not
too
many
of
any
religion,
i
assume?
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
without
a
quota?
just
sufficient
numbers,
but
that's
not
a
quota?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
say
sufficient
numbers,
you're...
i
mean
that
suggests
to
me
that
there
is...
there
is
some
minimum.
now,
you
don't
name
it.
but
there
has
to
be
some
minimum.
but
you
say
there
isn't
a
minimum?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you
have
to
eliminate
the
word
sufficient.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
2
percent
a
critical
mass,
ms.
mahoney?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
4
percent?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
pick
some
number,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
like
8,
is
8
percent?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
does
it
stop
being
a
quota
because
it's
somewhere
between
8
and
12,
but
it
is
a
quota
if
it's
10?
i
don't
understand
that
reasoning.
once
you
use
the
term
critical
mass
and...
you're...
you're
into
quota
land?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
long
as
you
say
between
8
and
12,
you're
okay?
is
that
it?
if
you
said
10
it's
bad
you
but
between
8
and
12
it's
okay,
because
it's
not
a
fixed
number?
is
that...
that's
what
you
think
the
constitution
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mahoney,
do
you
know
any
quota
program
that
would
take
somebody
to
fill
the
quota
no
matter
what?
all
the
quota
programs
i
know
start
off
by
saying
we
will
only
take
qualified
applicants,
but
then
setting
the
level
of
qualified
low
enough
that
they
can
fill
the
quota.
i
don't
know
any
program
that
said
no
matter
what
we're
going
to
fill
this
quota.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
establish
that
kind
of
a
standard
for
quota
is...
is
to...
is
to
just
eliminate
the...
the
whole
purpose
of...
of
that
aspect
of
our
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
aren't
just
like
every
applicant.
some
applicants
are
given
a
preference
because
of
their
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
you
say
automatically
follows
from
race?
justice
antonin
scalia
--does
the
constitution
prohibit
distribution
against...
against
oboe
players
as
opposed
to
flute
players?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
prohibit
distribution
on
the
basis
of
alumna
status?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
does
prohibit
distribution
on
the
basis
of
race?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
they're
in
already.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
people
you
want
to
talk
to
are
the
high
school
seniors
who
have
seen...
who
have
seen
people
visibly
less
qualified
than
they
are
get
into
prestigious
institutions
where
they
are
rejected.
if
you
think
that
is
not
creating
resentment,
you
are
just
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
any
other
area
where
we...
where
we
decide
the
case
by
saying
well,
there
are
very
few
people
who
are
being
treated
unconstitutionally.
i
mean,
if
this
indeed
is
an
unconstitutional
treatment
of...
of
this
woman,
because
of
her
race,
surely,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
she
is
one
of
very
few
who
have
been
treated
unconstitutionally.
