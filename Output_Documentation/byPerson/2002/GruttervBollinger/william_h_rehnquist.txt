mr.
kolbo.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
kolbo.
general
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
olson.
ms.
mahoney,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
mahoney,
supposing
that
after
our
bakke
decision
came
down,
whereas
cal.
davis
set
aside
16
seats
for
disadvantaged
minorities,
and
cal.
davis
said
we're
going
to
try
to
get
those
16
seats
in
some
way,
we're
going
to
try
high
school
graduates,
we're
going
to
try
socioeconomic
and
none
of
the...
none
of
those
methods
get
the
16
seats
that
they
want.
can
they
then
go
back
and
say
we've
tried
everything,
now
we're
entitled
to
set
aside
16
seats?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
my
hypothesis
was,
they
wanted
16
seats
and
that
plan
just
won't
give
it
to
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
says
wants
or
wants
maureen?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wants.
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
they
don't
interpret
the
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they...
they
don't
track,
as
i
understand
it,
the
other
pluses
that
the
university
talks
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can...
can
we
tell
from
the
statistics
whether
things
have
been
achieved
say,
more
and
more
minorities
are
getting
in
on
their
own
to
the
university
of
michigan
law
school
without
the
quotas?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
whether--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
critical
mass?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
say
the
last
15
years,
at
the
university
of
michigan,
which
wasn't
being
under
consideration
which
justice
powell's
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
the
university
determine
from
one
year
to
the
next,
you
say
some
years
it'll
come
out
8
percent,
some
year
9
percent,
do
they
make
a
conscious
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
toss
a
coin?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
can
regard
that
as
a
statement
rather
than
a
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kolbo,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
kolbo.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court,
in
no.
02-241,
grutter
against
bollinger
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
