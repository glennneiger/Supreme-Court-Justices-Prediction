mr.
kolbo,
may
i
call
your
attention
in
that
regard
to
the
brief
that
was
filed
on
behalf
of
some
retired
military
officers
who
said
that
to
have
an
officer
corps
that
includes
minority
members
in
any
number,
there
is
no
way
to
do
it
other
than
to
give
not
an
overriding
preference,
but
a
plus
for
race.
it
cannot
be
done
through
a
percentage
plan,
because
of
the
importance
of
having
people
who
are
highly
qualified.
what
is
your
answer
to
the
argument
made
in
that
brief
that
there
simply
is
no
other
way
to
have
armed
forces
in
which
minorities
will
be
represented
not
only
largely
among
the
enlisted
members,
but
also
among
the
officer
cadets?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
that
were
true.
let's
take
that
as
the
fact,
would
you
still
say
nonetheless
even
if
it's
true
that
there
will
be
very
few,
if
any,
minority
members
admitted
to
the
military
academies,
still
you
cannot
use
race?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why...
why
do
you
draw
the
line
at...
you
said
you
can
recruit...
you
can
use
a
race
criterion,
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
to
recruit,
you
could
have
minority
students
only
given
the
benefit
of
scholarships
to
go
to
these
preparatory
schools.
you
were
surely
recognizing
the
race
criterion
there.
why
is
that
permissible?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
was
asking
you
about
your
answer
to
the
question,
not...
the
fact
may
very
well
be,
but
i
thought
you
had
answered
the
question,
yes,
you
could
have
special
preparation
for
minorities
only,
yes,
you
could
have
recruitment
for
minorities
only.
i
thought
that
that
was
your
answer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
you're
right...
if
you're
right
about
what
equal
protection
requires
and
we
have
also
two
statutes
that
incorporate
the
equal
protection
principle,
then
there
could
be
no
affirmative
action,
i
take
it,
in
employment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
for
example,
if
we
have
a
prison
that
was
largely
minority
population
and
the
state
wanted
to
give
a
preference
so
that
it
would
have
a
critical
mass
of
correction
officers
of
the
minority
race,
that
would
be
impermissible?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
it's
not
in
my
hypothetical.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
recognize,
general
olson,
that
here
and
now,
all
of
the
military
academies
do
have
race
preference
programs
in
admissions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
that's
illegal
what
they're
doing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it...
that
it
is
illegal,
a
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
santa
clara...
i
think
what
justice
scalia
said
bears
modification,
because
in
fact
in
santa
clara,
the
highway
dispatcher,
there
was
a
plus
for
sex,
although
there
was
no
proven
discrimination
against
that
particular
woman
and
this
court
approved
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
in
fact
a
difference
between
the
michigan
plan
and
the
harvard
plan
that
the
harvard
plan
is
touted
in
bakke,
it
seems
to
me,
that
they
were
pretty
close
and
is
there
any
suggestion
that
her
i
am
sure
is
looking
for
critical
mass
that
harvard
didn't
look
for?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
mahoney,
how
does
the
michigan
plan
differ
or
the
harvard
plan,
for
that
matter,
from
what
was
familiar,
that
is,
highly
selected
schools
will
reject
a
certain
number
of
people,
take
a
number
of
people
as
automatic
acceptance
and
in
the
large
middle
will
say,
well,
we'll...
we'll
take
people
because
they're
different,
because
they
play
the
bassoon,
because
they
belong
to
a
minority
race?
because
in
the
days
that
when
i
went
to
law
school,
they
are
female,
because
we
want
the
class
to
be
diverse
and
so
they
used
race,
they
used
sex,
they
used--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
what
would
be
the
increase
of
the
named
plaintiffs,
the
increase
in
their
chance
of
admission,
were
there
no
average
tisk
programs?
