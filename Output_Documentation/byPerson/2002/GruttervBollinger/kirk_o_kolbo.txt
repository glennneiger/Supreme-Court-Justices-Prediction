mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
barbara
grutter
applied
for
admission
to
the
university
of
michigan
law
school
with
a
personal
right
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
that
she
would
not
have
her
race
counted
against
her.
that
race...
that
the
application
would
be
considered
for
free
from
the
taint
of
racial
discrimination.
the
law
school
intentionally
disregarded
that
right
by
discriminating
against
her
on
the
basis
of
race
as
it
does
each
year
in
the
case
of
thousands
of
individuals
who
apply
for
admission.
the
law
school
defends
its
practice
of
race
discrimination
as
necessary
to
achieve
a
diverse
student
body.
with
the
loss...
with
the
diversity
that
the
law
school
is
committed
to
ensuring
and
meaningful
numbers
or
critical
mass,
is
of
a
narrow
kind
defined
exclusively
by
race
and
ethnicity.
the
constitutional
promise
of
equality
would
not
be
necessary
in
a
society
composed
of
a
single
homogenous
mass.
it
is
precisely
because
we
are
a
nation
teeming
with
different
races
and
ethnicities...
one
that
is
increasingly
interracial,
multiracial,
that
it
is
so
crucial
for
our
government
to
honor
its
solemn
obligation
to
treat
all
members
of
our
society
equally
without
preferring
some
individuals
over
others.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
race
is
impermissible
because
of
the
constitutional
command
of
equality.
the
university
is
certainly
free
to
make
many
different
kinds
of
choices
in
selecting
students.
and
to
look
for
all
kinds
of
different
diversity,
experiential
diversity,
prospective
diversity
without
regard
to
race,
but
race
because,
your
honor,
of
the
constitutional
command
of
equality,
must
be
beyond
the
bounds--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--our
view,
your
honor,
is
that
race
itself
should
not
be
a
factor
among
others
in
choosing
students
because
of
the
constitution.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
and
i
want
to
be
clear
about
that.
we
are--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--and
we
absolutely
agree,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
we
believe
not,
your
honor,
for
the
reason
that
we
need
to
get
away
from
the
notion
that
there's
some
right
number
for
each
racial
group.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
i
wouldn't
say
not
to
be
concerned,
your
honor,
i
think
the
mere
fact
of
underrepresentation,
that
is
that
say,
blacks
are
not
represented
as
they
are
in
the
population
is
not
a
concern
that
would
justify
racial
preferences.
it
certainly
would
justify
perhaps
broad
social
and
political
concerns.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
the
current
concern
there,
your
honor,
ought
to
be
addressed
by...
by
addressing
the
problem.
if
there
is
some
reason
that...
that
particular
minority
groups
are
not
participating
as
fully
in
the
fruits
of
our
society
such
as
being
represented
at
the
schools,
we
need
to
address
those
problems.
but
racial
preferences
don't
address
those
problems.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
we
have
an
adequate
record
in
this
case
from
which
to
conclude
that
we
wouldn't
have
representation
of
minorities.
the
military
in
the
absence
of--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--i
believe
race
could
not
be
used,
your
honor.
i
think
that
other
solutions
could
be
looked
addressing
the
problem
why
they
are
not
minorities
in
the
military.
i
note
that
the
united
states
has
not
taken
a
position.
we
have
the
brief
as
your
honor
has
mentioned
from
several
individuals,
the
united
states
has
not
taken
a
position
in
this
case,
the
military
academies
have
not
taken
a
position.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
as
i
understand
it,
justice
stevens,
the
briefs
are
filed
on
the
behalf
of
individuals.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
well,
your
honor--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--we
don't
challenge
what
they
say,
your
honor.
we're
just
suggesting...
we
don't
have
a
record
in
this
case.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
we
don't
have
enough
information
on
it
to
know
whether--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--i
just
don't
know,
your
honor,
what
the
facts
are
with
respect
to
the
military
because
this
case
was--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--it
does
not,
your
honor.
we
have
no
evidence
as
to
what
the
extent
of
representation
is.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
well,
your
honor,
again,
the...
the
terms
you've
used,
reasonable
and
adequate,
we
have
no
information
in
this
record
on
which
i
can
make
those--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--and
that
number,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
again,
because
it
wasn't
part
of
this
case.
i
think
it's
more--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
the
court--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--taking
race
neutral
alternatives
into
consideration?
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
it
certainly
functions
differently,
your
honor.
race
controls--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--certainly,
yes--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--i
do,
your
honor,
because
it's
not
just
minorities
that
are
socioeconomically
disadvantaged
in
this
country.
that
happens
with
respect
across
racial
lines.
so
race
neutral
alternatives--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--well,
i
would
disagree,
your
honor,
because
i
think
if
you
have
a
race
neutral
means
that
accomplishes
many
purposes,
and
one
of
them
is
race,
that
is
not
necessarily
under
this
court's
precedents
unconstitutional.
the
court--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--sure.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
i
see
no
constitutional
objection
there,
justice
kennedy.
for
the
reason
i
think
it...
it's
quite
permissible
in
principle
to
draw
a
line
between
casting
a
wider
net,
recruiting
and...
and
the
point
of
competition
where
people...
where
people...
where
the
decision
must
be
made
whether
people
are
going
to
be
treated
on
the
basis
of
the
same--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--i
don't
see
the
constitutional
objection
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
because
very
simply,
justice
breyer,
the
constitution
provides
the
right
of...
individuals
with
the
right
of
equal
protection.
and
by
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
race
at
a
point
of
competition,
innocent
individuals
are
being
injured
in
their
constitutional
rights.
that's
the
distinction
between
that
and
simply
trying
to
cast
a
wider
net,
recruiting
spending
money
on
outreach
efforts,
a
very
principal
line
it
seems
to
me
can
be
drawn
between
those
two
things.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
the
difference
is
the
equal
protection
clause,
your
honor.
it
does
not
apply
to
alumni
preferences
in
scholarships.
it
applies
to
race.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
sound
and
reasonable,
your
honor,
is
not
enough
when
it
comes
to
race.
it
must
be
a
compelling
purpose.
and
that
is
the
difference.
there
are
many
policy
choices
a
university
can
make
that
i
may
disagree
or
agree
with,
and
that
i
have
no
legal
standing
or
no
client
has
a
legal
standing
to
challenge,
because
they
don't
implicate
important
constitutional
rights.
there
is
something
special
about
race
in
this
country.
it's
why
we
have
a
constitution
about
it.
it's
why
we
have
a
constitutional
amendment.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
because
it
doesn't
prevent
someone
from
applying.
the
key
is
to
be
able
to
compete
on
the
same
footing
at
the
point
of
competition.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
certainly
not--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--that--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--they're
not,
your
honor.
they
are
open
to...
accessible
to
all.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
i
believe
you
can...
as
part
of
a
broad
program,
i
believe
you
could.
you
could
seek
outreach
for
minority
students,
because
it's
very
simple
it
seems
to
me
to
draw
a
principal
distinction
between
outreach,
casting
a
wider
net
and
applying
the
same
standard
at
the
point
of...
at
the
point
of
competition.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
no,
of
course,
your
honor.
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
outreach
would
be
limited
to
minorities
only.
i'm
just
suggesting
that...
i
don't
understand
why
there
would
be
a
constitutional
objection
to
trying
to
cast
a
wider
net
by
focusing
as
part
of
a
broader
effort
of
outreach
in
recruiting
minority
students
and
it
can
be
quite...
it's
quite
easy
to
draw
the
line
between
that
and...
and
the
point
of
competition.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
there
could
be,
your
honor,
to
remedy
past
identified
discrimination,
but
not
to
exceed
diversity
and
there
is
not
today
as
i
understand
it
any
compelling
interest
in
the
employment
context
with
respect
to--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--it
would
be
impermissible,
your
honor,
unless
based
upon
a
compelling
interest
and
the
only
one
that
has
been
recognized
in
the
employment
context
is
identified
discrimination.
and
i
don't
see
that
in
your
hypothetical.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
again,
it's
a
distinction
drawn
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
if
it's
slots
on
the
basis
of
race,
your
honor.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
thank
you,
if
i
may
follow-up
on
the
last
question.
counsel's
answer
to
the
last
couple
of
questions,
i
think,
really
crystallizes
the
difference
between
their
position
and
ours.
the
university
of
michigan
sees
this
as
a
question
of
group
rights.
there
are
rights
on
the
part
of
minorities.
and
there
are
rights...
there
are
rights
on
the
part
of
whites
and
asians
and
other...
other
groups.
we
see
it
very
differently.
the
constitution
protects
the
rights
of
individuals,
not
racial
groups.
the
bakke
case
opening
up
16
spaces
in
the
class
when
that
system
was
struck
down
meant
that
about
2,500
students,
2,500
to
3,000
students
who
had
previously
been
discriminated
against
now
had
an
opportunity
to
compete
for
those
seats.
so
it
seems
to
me
the
question
is
not
answered
by
how
many
have
been
discriminated
against.
the
question
is
whether
in
fact
discrimination
is
occurring
against
the
individual
and
it
certainly
is
in
this
particular
case.
counsel
was
asked
some
questions
about
the
open-ended
nature
of
the
policy
at
issue
here.
and
i
think
it's
very
critical
that
we
understand
that
if
the
interests
that
they
are
asserting
here
to
be
compelling
is
upheld
as
compelling
by
this
court,
we
have
in
fact
the
first
indefinite,
ongoing,
unlimited
compelling
interest.
the
court
previously
has
confined
its
analysis
to
remedying...
remedying
identified
discrimination.
a
remedy
based
on
societal
discrimination
or
a
role-model
theory
for
example
in
wygant.
a
couple
of
the
reasons
that
the
court
struck
down
those
rationals
was
because
they
were
so
unlimited,
so
amorphus,
indefinite
with
respect
to
time.
that
certainly
is
the
case
with
the
interest
that
is
being
urged
here
today.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is...
it
becomes
very
clear
in
the
university's
argument
that
what
they've
done...
and
they
didn't
argue
so
much
this
in
the
lower
court,
but
they
made
it
very
clear
that
their
justification
for
the
preferences
is
based
in
effect
on
remedying
societal
discrimination.
their
argument
and
their
briefs
and
in
this
court
has
been
that
when
the
day
comes,
someday
and
maybe
it
will
come
someday,
we
hope
that
it
will,
that
someday
that
we
will
be
able
to
stop
using
race
for
these
purposes.
and
the
opinion
that
accepted
that
rational
it
seems
to
me
would
be
a
dramatic
step
backward
from
this
court's
precedents
which
rejected
the
notion
that
something
as
amorphus
as
societal
discrimination
would
be
sufficient.
