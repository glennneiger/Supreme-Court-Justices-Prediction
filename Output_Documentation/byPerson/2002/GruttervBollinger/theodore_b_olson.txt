mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
michigan
law
school
admissions
program
fails
every
test
this
court
has
articulated
for
evaluating
governmental
racial
preferences.
first,
it
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
understand...
the...
our
position
with
respect
to
that
is
we
respect
the
opinions
of
those
individuals,
but
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
we
do
not
accept
the
proposition
that
black
soldiers
will
only
fight
for...
black
officers
or
the
reverse
that
race
neutral
means
should
be
used
in
the
academies
as
well
as
other
places.
and
that
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
difference
in
analysis,
the
court
might
consider
its
position,
the
position
it
articulated
in
connection
with
the
military
in
rostker
v.
goldberg.
but
our
position
with
respect
to
that
brief
is
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
i'm
suggesting
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
court
will
want
to
look
at
each
of
these
individual
situations
according
to
the
circumstances
and
that
may
be
a
factor
in
that
context.
but
i
started
my
answer,
justice
stevens,
by
saying
you
do
not
accept
the
proposition
that
race
neutral
means
should
not
be
used
and
employed
fully
to...
to
make
sure
that
the
academies
are
accessible
and
open
and...
and
offer
opportunities
for
as
many
people
as
possible.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
coast
guard
does
not.
it's
prohibited
by
congress
from
doing
so.
i
do
acknowledge,
justice
ginsburg
that
the
other
academies
are
doing
so.
it's
the
position
of
the
united
states--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
haven't
examined
that
and
we
haven't
presented
a
brief
with
respect
to
the
specifics
of
each
individual
academy.
and
we
would
want
to
take
into
consideration
any
potential
impact
suggested
by
the
court
in
the
rostker
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there
are
a
variety
of
race
neutral
means
and
narrowly
tailored
methods
by
which
academies
and
universities
can
reach
out
to
people
of
all
backgrounds
to
make
sure
that
they've
eliminated--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
widespread
recruiting,
making
sure
that
there's
opportunities
for
education
and
advancement
in
the...
in
the
academies.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--not
limited,
a
race
neutral
system
of
broad
scale
recruiting
that
this
court
has
always
supported
the
proposition
that
efforts
may
be
made
by
governmental
institutions
to
eliminate
barriers
that
have
existed
where
artificial
barriers--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
is
the
opinion
of
certain
individuals.
it
is...
we
do
not
accept
that
conclusion
based
upon
those
opinions.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
race
neutral
means
must
be
demonstrated
and
will
be
accepted,
and
will
not...
and
the
court
will
not
accept
the
proposition
that
race
neutral
means
will
not
be
successful
unless
they've
been
attempted
and
demonstrated.
these...
this
program
that
the
university
of
michigan
law
school
fails
every
one
of
the
court's
tests.
first,
it's
a
thinly
disguised
quota
which
sets
aside
a
significant
portion
of
each
year's
entering
class
for
preferred
ethnic
groups.
secondly,
it
overtly
employs
stigmatizing
and
divisive
racial
stereotypes,
what
the
law
school
calls
diversity-relevant
characteristics.
it
identifies
persons
by
diversity-relevant
characteristics.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
exactly.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
a
response
to
those
many
arguments
is
that
they've...
they're
using
stereotypes
to
in
an
effort,
they
say
to
break
down
stereotypes,
they're
using
race
as
a...
a
surrogate
for
experience.
and
if
they
want
to
look
at
experience,
they
can
look
at
experience.
if
they
want
to
improve
the
educational
opportunities
of
minority
groups,
one
of
the
biggest
problems--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
that
person...
that
person
if
he
went
to
exeter
and
he
has
a
great
gpa
and
so
forth
gets
an
extra
opportunity
either
a
portion
of
the
class
is
set
aside
for
that
individual
solely
on
the
basis
of
race,
irrespective
of
his
experience.
and
the...
and
the
application
isn't
examined
for
the
type
of
experience
or
the
type
of
viewpoint
that
race-diversity
characteristic
is
used
as
a
substitute
for
any
examination
of
the
individual
on
the
individual.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
disagree
with
that
approach
in
the
sense
that
we...
we...
in
the
first
place,
contrary
to
what
our
opponents
have
said,
we
would
not
believe
that
that
single
opinion,
which
was
the
only
opinion,
to
examine
the
issue
of
diversity
under
a
compelling
argument--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we're
reluctant
to
say
never,
justice
o'connor.
but
this
test...
every
test
that
justice
powell
applied
in
that
opinion,
the
law
school
program
here
fails.
it's
a
stereotype.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i'm
suggesting
that
the
programs
here,
without
getting
to
the
point
of
whether
are
there
any
other
circumstances
whether
they
be
remedial,
which
this
court...
a
factor
of
the
court
has
recognized
before,
or
something
else
in
an
unusual
situation,
where
it
could
be
appropriate.
i
don't
know
what
that
might
be.
but
this
test--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
would
also
say
that
it's
conceivable
if
you're
constructing...
the
national
institutes
of
health
is
constructing
this
study
of
diseases
that
focus
on
particular
races,
the
race
may
be
a
factor
but
the
fact
is
that
the
law
school
program
here,
not
only
is
a
set
aside
and
a
quota,
but
it...
but
it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
the
harvard
program
a
wasn't
examined
aaccording
to
to
any
compelling
governmental
interest.
it
was
examined
only--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
would
not
based
upon
any
what
we
see
in
that
opinion,
which
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
only
way
to
answer
that
justice
kennedy
is
that
the
word
diversity
means
so
many
things
to
so
many
different
people.
it
means
both
a
means
to
get
experience
and
a
diversity
of
experience.
it
also
means,
i
think
what
the
law
school
has
done,
it's
an
end
in
and
of
itself.
if
it's
an
end
in
and
of
itself,
obviously
it's
constitutionally
objectionable
that
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--justice
breyer,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
stated
motive
of
the
texas
plan
or
the
california
or
the
florida
plan.
those
are
intended
to
open
up
those
institutions
to
a
broader
selection,
one
of
the
ways
in
which
this
court
has
accepted
the
institution
such
as
universities
may
operate
is
to
make
sure
that
barriers
are
broken
down,
accessibility
is
made
more
available
and
that
is
one
very
race
neutral
means
of
accomplishing
that
legitimate
objective.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
depends
upon
segregation
of
the
schools
in
texas
or
in
any
other
place.
it
is
a
diverse
selection
of
the
high
schools
in
that
state.
