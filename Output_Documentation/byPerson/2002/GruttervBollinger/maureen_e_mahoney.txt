ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
solicitor
general
acknowledges
the
diversity
may
be
a
compelling
interest
but
contends
that
the
university
of
michigan
law
school
can
achieve
a
diverse
student
body
through
facially
race
neutral
means.
his
argument
ignores
the
record
in
this
case.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the
brief
says
that
it
is
one
of
the
paramount
interests
of
government
to
have
diversity
in
higher
education.
and
it
has
certainly
been
the
consistent
position
of
the
department
of
education
for
the
past
25
years
that
bakke
is
the
governing
standard,
that
schools
are
encouraged
to
use
programs
to
achieve
diversity,
because
of
the
important
interests
it
serves
for
students
of
all
color.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
court's
judgment
in
bakke
said
and
certainly
what
justice
powell's
opinion
said
is
that
it's
simply
not
necessary
to
do
a
set
aside
because
a
plan
like
the
harvard
plan,
which
takes
race
into
account
as
one
factor
can
be
used
as
an
effective
means
to--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
if...
if
the
program
was
designed
to
have
a
fixed
16
seats,
no
matter
what
the
qualifications
of
the
applicant
pool,
no
matter
what
the
disparities
between
the
minority
and
majority
students
would
be,
then
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
that
would
be
a
quota.
if
that
is
the
nature
of
the
program.
but
here
the
record
indicates
that
the...
the
law
school's
program
is
nothing
of
the
kind.
that
what
has
occurred
over
the
years
with
this
program
is
that
there
have
been
offers
that
have
ranged
from
160
to
232
over
the
course
of
eight
years
there
have
been
enrollments
that
went
from
44
to
73.
it
has
been
a
very
flexible
program.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
this
court's
cases
that
suggests
that
the
law
school
has
to
make
an
election
between
academic
excellence
and
racial
diversity.
the
interest
here
is
having
a--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
the
question
isn't
whether
it's
important
to
override
the
prohibition
on
discrimination.
it's
whether
this
is
discrimination.
michigan...
what
michigan
is
doing
benefits--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
the
issue
is
whether
it
is
sufficiently
compelling
to
allow
michigan
to
take
race
into
account
in
this
limited
fashion
in
order
to
provide
a
much
better
education
for
students
of
all
races.
the
benefits
are
race
neutral,
your
honor,
and
the
burdens
are
really
quite
limited.
what
we're
talking
about
here--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but
your
honor
there
is
a
compelling
interest
in
having
an
institution
that
is
both
academically
excellent
and
racially
diverse,
because
our
leaders
need
to
be
trained
in
institutions
that
are
excellent,
that
are
superior
academically,
but
they
also
need
to
be
trained
with
exposure
to
the
viewpoints,
to
the
prospectives,
to
the
experiences
of
individuals
from
diverse
backgrounds.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
because
the
district
court
did
not
make
any
factual
findings
that
would
support
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
disguised
quota.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
the...
there
has
to
be
evidence
in
the
record
that
would
support
the
conclusion
that
it's
a
quota.
and
what
this
court
has
said
that
means
is
a
fixed
number...
that
is
sufficiently
rigid
that
no
matter
what
the
qualifications
of
the
applicant
pool,
the
law
school
is
going
to
adhere
to
a
fixed
minimum
and
i
think
it's
important
to
say
what
the
judge
found
on
this
issue,
at
230a
of
the
position
of
appendix,
the
judge
says
in
conclusion,
the
court
finds
that
the
law
school
wants,
10
to
17
percent
of
each
class
to
consist
of
african
americans,
native
americans
and
hispanics.
wants.
that's
an
aspiration.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
wants.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
wants,
your
honor.
that's
an
aspiration,
that
is
not
a
fixed
minimum.
he
made
no
findings
that
there
was
a
fixed
minimum.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
the
evidence
indicates
that
the
harvard
plan
works
in
exactly
the
way
the
michigan
plan
does.
in
fact,
harvard's
brief
in
this
case
indicates
that
under
their
plan
over
the
last
four
years,
they
enrolled
eight
to
9
percent
african
americans
which
is
a
stable
range.
in
the
last
four
years
of
the
record
evidence
here,
the
university
of
michigan
law
school
enrolled
7
to
9
percent
african
americans.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes.
what
we--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
in
fact,
the
court
upheld...
or
just
powell
appended
the
harvard
plan
to
his
opinion
in
this
case
and
there
were
five
votes
that
the
reason
that
the
mandate
of
the
california
supreme
court
should
be
reversed
was
because
there
was
an
effective
alternative
for...
for
enrolling
minorities
and
that
effective
alternative
was
a
plan
like
the
harvard
plan.
and
the...
the
dissenting--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
was--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
the
purpose
of
the
harvard
plan
that
was
attached.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
there
is...
there
is
certainly
a
major
difference
between
an
educational
policy
that
is
motivated
by
an
intent
to
exclude
people
based
on
racial
animus
and
one
like
the
law
school's
policy
and
the
harvard
plan,
which
is
designed
to
include
students
of
all
races,
so
that
the
education
of
all
students
will
be
enriched
as
a
result.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
your
honor--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor
it
is
not
a
question
of
not
too
many.
it's
that
the
law
school
has
attempted
to
take
race
into
account
in
a
very
mod
defendant
limited
fashion,
no
more
than
necessary
to
achieve
the
goal
of
trying
to
have
sufficient
numbers
of
minorities
that
there
can
be
an
excellent
educational
experience
for
everyone.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor
it
is
not
a
quota.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor
there
isn't
a
minimum.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
it...
it
can
be
related
to
numbers
without
being
a
quota.
in
fact,
the
department
of
education
in
1979
after
bakke
came
out,
issued
a
policy
interpretation
at
44
federal
register
58510
which
specifically
says
authorizes
schools
to
establish
and
pursue
numerical
goals,
end
quote,
as
long
as
they
don't
set
aside
a
fixed
number
of
places
or
make
race
the
sole
criteriaen
for
eligibility.
that
was
the
department
of
education's
interpretation.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
they
don't
your
honor,
but
that
is
what
bakke
held.
that
was...
that
was
the...
what
was
at
issue
in
that
case,
that
that
was
the
difference
between
the
program
that
u
c
davis
had
used
and
the
program
that
was
at
issue
in
the
harvard
plan.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
absolutely
your
honor.
what
justice
powell's
opinion
says
when
paraphrasing
the
harvard
plan
is
that
there
needs
to
be
an
awareness
of
the
necessity
for
more
than
token
numbers.
and
that's
because
the
educational
benefits
of
diversity
can't
be
achieved.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
that's
not
correct.
the...
there
is
a
report
which
is
called
the
daily.
but
it
is
not
looked
at
everyday.
the
evidence
was
clear
that
it
is
simply
something
that
can
be
printed
out.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
the
reason
it's
called
a
daily
is
that
it
is
a
running
database
that
allows
for
the
report
to
be
printed
at
any
time.
and...
and
the
evidence
indicated
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
the
details
actually
track
a
whole
variety
of
admissions
information
including
deposits,
they're
trying
to
see
how
they're
doing
in
terms
of
whether--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
they
track...
they
track
residency,
they
track
gender,
they
don't
track,
for
instance,
socioeconomic
status
which
is
a
plus
or,
in
fact,
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted
the
university
takes
any
racial
background,
any
ethnic
background,
any
unusual
characteristic
that
would
add
to
the
diversity
of
the
class
into
account,
but
it
doesn't
find
a
need
to
track
that,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
applicant
pool.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
what--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
actually
what--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--now,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
what
a
quota
is
under
this
court's
cases
is
a
fixed
number.
and
there
is
no
fixed
number
here.
the
testimony
was
that
it
depends
on
the
characteristics
of
the
applicant
pool.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
if
it
was
a
fixed
range
that
said
that
it
will
be
a
minimum
of
8
percent,
come
hell
or
high
water,
no
matter
what
the
qualifications
of
these
applicants
look
like,
no
matter
what
it
is
that
the
majority
applicants
could
contribute
to
the
benefits
of
diversity,
then
certainly
that
would
be
a
quota,
but
that
is
not
what
occurred
here.
and
in
fact
the
testimony
was
undisputed,
that
this
was
not
intended
to
be
a
fixed
goal.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
what
the
policy
says,
of
course,
is
that
it
will
only
take
race
into
account
as
long
as
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
the
educational
objectives.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should
conclude
that
this
is
permanent,
because
there
are
two
things
that
can
happen
that
will
make
this
come
to
an
end.
the
first
is
that
the
number
of
high-achieving
minorities
will
continue
to
grow
and
that
law
school
will
be
able
to
enrole
a
sufficient
number
to
have
a
critical
mass
or
meaningful
numbers
with
substantial
presence
without
having
to
take
race
into
account.
the
second
thing
that
can
happen,
your
honor,
is
that
we
could
reach
a
point
in
our
society
where
the
experience
of
being
a
minority
did
not
make
such
a
fundamental
difference
in
their
lives,
where
race
didn't
matter
so
much
that
it's
truly
salient
to
the
law
school's
educational
mission.
while
that
i
can't
say
when
that
will
happen,
we
certainly
know
that
as
a
nation,
we
have
made
tremendous
progress
in
overcoming
intolerance.
and
we
certainly
should
expect
that
that
will
occur
with
respect
to
minorities.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
in
bakke
itself,
your
honor.
in
bakke
itself,
there
were
five
votes
to
allow
the
university
of
california
davis
to
use
a
plan
modeled
on
the
harvard
plan.
it's
been
in
effect
for
about
25
years.
it
has
repeated
extraordinary
benefits
for
this
country's
educational
system.
and
i
think
it's
far
too
soon
for
this
court
to
included
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
they're
not
quotas,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
we
know
aspirations.
at
per
rations
moan
but
we
do
know
your
honor
that
there
has
been
improvement,
in
fact,
justice
powell
cited
to
a
study,
it
was
done
by
manning
it's
in
footnote
50
of
justice
powell's
opinion
and
it
gives
the
number
of
minorities
who
had
achieved
a
165
and
a
3.5
on
the
lsat.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
the
answer
would
be
that
we
do
know
that
in
1964
when
there
was
a
race-blind
policy,
there
were
no
blacks
admitted,
and
under
a
race-blind
policy
today,
probably
six
blacks
would
be
admitted
without
consideration
of
race.
so
there
has
not
been
enough
progress
to
allow
for
meaningful
numbers
at
this
point,
but
there
has
been
progress.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
we
know
that
for
the
first...
i
think,
4
or
5
years,
both
only
enrolled
about...
between
i
think
zero
and
7
african
american
students.
they
do
better
on
hispanics
because
of
the
demographics
of
that
state,
where
it's
virtually
50
percent
hispanic
at
the
college-age
level.
but
what
we
have
learned
is
that
in
the...
they
changed
their
program
2
years
ago
and
this
fall
they
succeeded
in
enrolling
14
african-american
students,
but
what
we
know
from
talking
to
the
law
school
admissions
counsel
with
bolt's
permission
is
that
the
african-americans
who
were
enrolled
under
that
program
have
a
9
point
lsat
score
gap
from
the
whites
who
have
been
enrolled,
so
the
same
gap--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
ucla,
well,
this
is
mainly
your
honor
a
problem
for
the
highly
selective
schools
because
of
the
nature
of
the
pool.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
ucla.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
ucla...
ucla
had...
the
class
that's
graduatiing
this
year,
for
instance,
i
believe
had
five
blacks
in
it.
so
i
believe
last
fall
they
did
better
and
we
have
been
told
that
that's
because
they
were
able
to
recruit
some
additional
numbers
of
black
students
because
of
a
special
critical
race
studies
program
they're
offering
but
that's
not
a
solution
to
the
pool
problem,
your
honor.
the
pool
problem
is
that
if
we
look
at
the
ranges
of
lsats
where
the
university
of
michigan
takes
its
students,
there
are
literally
about
30
in
the
entire
country,
three
or
four
per
top
10
schools.
so
some
kind
of,
you
know,
race-conscious
recruiting
that
schools
are
using
doesn't
solve
that
problem.
and
if
i
could
go
back
to
bolt
for
just
another
minute,
because
that
is
something
that
the
petitioners
raised
in
their
reply
brief,
is
that
given
that
we
know
that
they
have
exactly
the
sam
9-point
lsat
gap
that
michigan
gets
under
its
program,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
what
they
are
doing
would
satisfy
the
petitioner's
conception
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
because,
your
honor
i
think--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
because
i
think...
certainly
if
it's
a
fixed
number
that
you're
going
to
take
no
matter
what,
then
that
is
a
quota,
but
i
think
the
difference
between
a
quota
and
a
goal
is
the
flexibility.
and
what
this
court,
for
instance,
said
in
johnson
when
talking
about,
they
authorized
the
use
of
a
goal
and
they
said
that
the
line
between
a
goal
and
a
quota
is
in
fact
whether
or
not
you
have
to
automatically
and
blindly
promote
people
in
order
to
meet
the
goal
or
whether
it
is
a
factor
that
is
taken
into
account
and
that's
exactly
what
occurs
here.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
the
evidence
shows--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
it's
not
tossing
a
coin,
but
it
is
not
a
fixed
number.
what
they
do
is,
they
look...
it's
responsive
to
the
applicant
pool.
they
look
at
the
applicants,
they
are
looking
at
a
variety
of
factors
on
a
holistic
basis
and
they
find
the
applicants
that
they
think
are
going
to
bring
the
most
in
toto
to
the
law
school
class,
but
it
is
not
measured
against
a
specific
numerical
target.
and
the
district
court
did
not
find
otherwise.
it
is
simply
looking
at
that
pool
and
what
michigan
is--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--actually,
your
honor,
the
way
that
in
bakke
it
worked,
it
wasn't
the
situation
that
they
would
take
someone
no
matter
what,
but
they
did
have
a
rule,
that
you
could
not
be
considered
for
the
spaces
that
had
been
set
aside
if
you
were
white.
and
so
it
works
in
a
very
different
way,
your
honor.
there...
bakke
applied,
there
were
four
spaces
available
in
the
special
admissions
program,
but
he
couldn't
be
considered
for
them,
because
of
his
race.
that
doesn't
happen
at
the
university
of
michigan.
when
someone
applies,
whether
they're
white,
it
doesn't
matter
how
my
minorities
have
been
accepted
or
rejected.
they
are
considered
on
their
merits
just
like
every
other
applicant.
that's
the
defining
difference
between
what
happened
in
the
uc
davis
program.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
they
are
given
extra
weight
in
the
process,
because
they
have
something
unusual
and
important
to
bring
to
the
class.
that's
what
every...
that's
the
way
every
applicant
is
considered
and--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
they
also
write
essays
about
diversity.
every
applicant
is
given
the
chance
to
write
an
essay
about
diversity.
the
law
school
does--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
exactly
what
the
university
of
michigan
law
school
plan
does.
it
looks
at
all
potential
contributions
to
diversity.
and
what
the
evidence
shows
in
this
case
is
that
it
is
common
for
white
applicants
to
be
admitted
with
lower
grades
and
test
scores
than
even
minorities
who
are
rejected
because--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
but
the
question
is
whether
this
is
prohibited
discrimination.
and
the
answer
that
we
would
ask
this
court
to
give
is
that
a
minority
applicant
brings
something
special.
they
are
not
similarly
situated
to
the
white
applicant
who
has
the
exact
same
grades
and
test
scores.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the
record
certainly
does
not
support
that
inference
under
this
program.
and
the
reason
is
this:
the
program...
one
of
the
ways
to
prevent
that
from
happening
is
to
have
a
narrowly
tailored
program
to
have
very
limited
consideration
of
race
and
not
to,
for
instance,
have
two
great
a
disparity
between
the
qualifications
of
the
white
students
who
are
admitted
and
the
minority
students
who
are
admitted
under
the
program.
here
it's
actually
quite
limited.
in
fact,
you
know,
the
vast...
the
most...
the
most
of
the
minorities
who
are
admitted
are
in
the
top
16
percent
of
all
lsat
takers
in
the
country.
so
we're
talking
about
a
really
exceptional
group
of
students.
by
keeping
the
relative
qualifications
fairly
close,
like
that,
you
really
minimize
the
potential
for
any
kind
of
stigmatizing
or
hostility,
that
sort
of
thing.
and
what
the
record
shows
is
that
in
the
orfield
study
which
was
done
of
harvard
and
university
of
michigan's
students,
it's
in
the
record
at
exhibit
167,
that
there
is
overwhelming
support
by
the
students
at
harvard
and
michigan
law
schools
for
maintaining
the
diversity
program,
because
they
regard
it
as
so
positive.
that's--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor
that's
for
the--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
your
honor,
certainly
the
minorities
who
have
been
admitted
under
the
program
are
not
feeling
stigmatized
by
it.
if
they
continue
to
support
the
program
in
the
ways
that
they
do.
in
addition,
the
whites
who
are
seeing
their
performance
in
the
class
and
who
are
confirming
that
they
find
it
highly
beneficial
to
have
the...
the
chance
to
share
the
experiences
of
the
minority
students
when
they
are
learning
about
the
law,
has
to
be
given
substantial
weight
in
considering
whether
this
is
somehow
stigmatizing
or
perpetuating
historic
stereotypes,
which
is
really
the
test
that
this
court
used
in
vmi
to
determine
whether
or
not
something
should
really
be
condemned
because
of
its
potential
to
stigmatize.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
there
are
really
three
things
other
than
a
quota
to
look
for.
the
first
is
whether
there
is
flexible
consideration
of
the
diversity
contributions
of
every
potential
student,
which
michigan
program
clearly
satisfies,
whether
the
minorities
who
are
being
admitted
are
well
qualified,
because
you
don't
want
to
have
a
situation
where
they
can't
contribute
to
the
class
and
can't
succeed,
and
the
third
is
the
degree
of
the
burden
on
the
rejected
applicants,
that's
certainly
relevant
under
any
narrow
tier
learning
program.
and
here,
what
the
record
tells
us
is
that
95
percent
of
all
the
admissions
decisions
that
are
made
each
year
are
not
affected
by
the
consideration
of
race.
that
the
chance...
that
there
are
about
2500
students
who
are
rejected
each
year
probably
only
80
of
them
would
have
been...
would
have
gotten
an
offer
of
admission
from
michigan
under
a
race-blind
system.
that
is
a
very
small
and
diffuse
burden.
it's
not
one
to
be
minimized.
it's
certainly
something
that
the
court
has
to
pay
attention
to,
but
this
is
extremely
limited
in
scope
and
relative
to
the
benefits
to
students
of
all
races
and
to
our
nation.
it
has
to
be
weighed
in
the
balance
and
this
court
certainly
should
conclude
that
the
interests
that
are
being
served,
the
legitimate
interests
that
are
being
served
are
sufficiently
compelling
to
allow
this
kind
of
limited
consideration
of
race.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
don't
know
what
the
increase
for
the...
for
barbara
grutter
would
have
been,
for
instance,
we
do
know
that
across
the
class,
it
would
have
been
approximately
5
percent.
one
might
say
that
that
could
vary,
you
know,
by
individual.
the
record
evidence
would
indicate,
however,
that
barbara
grutter
would
not
have
been
admitted
under
a
race-blind
program,
although
that
issue
has
not
been
litigated
to
conclusion.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
thank
you,
your
honor.
