mr.
theodore
b.
olson
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
right
to
control
a
business,
whether
or
not
for
profit,
is
a
well-recognized
and
longstanding
interest
in
property.
when
that
control
is
surrendered
in
response
to
unlawful
force,
whether
motivated
by
economics,
politics,
or
ideals,
the
extortionist
has
attained
his
objective,
and
the
hobbs
act
has
been
violated.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
there's
an
unlawful
use
of
force
or
threats
or
violence,
justice
kennedy,
whether
it
be
in
the
form
of
trespassing...
and
the
aim...
which
this
court
recognized
8
years
ago
in
this...
in
this
very
predecessor
case
was
to
shut
down
the
clinics.
if
that
aim
is
achieved,
the
control
of
the
property
has
been
transferred
from
the
owner
of
those
clinics
to
the
extortionist.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
as
justice
souter
said
in...
in
the
dissent,
which
you
joined,
in
the
earlier
case,
the
first
amendment
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
and
it
can
be
dealt
with
in
particular
circumstances
in
particular
cases
where
it
arises.
the
issue
here
is
if
the
use
of
force--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
was
the
question
that
was
presented
that
was
not
accepted
by
this
court.
question
3,
i
think
it
was,
or
4
in
the...
the
one
scheidler
petition
was
not
accepted
by
this
court.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
submit,
justice
scalia,
that
that
is
not
going
to
be
the...
the
problem
that
this
court
or
any
courts
are
going
to
have
to
face.
first
of
all,
the
definition
of
property
as
controlling
a
business
has
been
accepted
for
a
long
time.
now,
the
only
question
that
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--under
some
circumstances,
it
could
have
if
illegal
force
or
threats
were
used
to
prevent
a
business
from
operating.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in
many--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
they--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--this...
this
court
specifically
carved
out
an
exemption
in...
in
the
enmons
case
with
respect
to
legitimate
labor
objectives--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
made
it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what...
what
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i...
i
can't
pull
a
specific
piece
of
the
language
out
of
the
statute,
but
this
court
said
nearly
20
times
in
the
enmons
case
that
the
hobbs
act
was
not
intended
to
cover
achievement
of
legitimate
collective
bargaining
demands,
and
because
the
court
did
not
want
to--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i...
i
take
that
the
court,
because
it
said
over
15,
nearly
20
times
legitimate
collective
bargaining
demands,
legitimate
union
objectives--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i...
i
can
only
submit,
justice
scalia,
that
it
seemed
to
me
a
clear
implication
of
the
words
used
by
the
court
and
the
fact
that
the
court
emphasized
that
it
was...
that
we
were
dealing
with...
the
court
was
dealing
with
the
extraordinary...
the
potential
extraordinary
change
in
federal
labor
law,
that
that
phrase
was
emphasized
over
and
over
again.
neither
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--in
the...
in
the
context
of
the
history--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
not
out
of
nowhere,
justice
scalia.
there
was
a
long
history
of--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what...
what
the
statute...
what
the
language
of
the
statute
does...
and
here's...
here's
where...
what
i
would
emphasize.
the
language
of
the
statute
specifically
makes
it
unlawful
and
makes
no
exception
for...
for
whether
the...
whether
the...
the
petitioner...
the...
the
protester,
or
the...
or
the
alleged
extortionist
is
motivated
by
ideals
or
politics
or
wanting
to
shut
down
a
business
or
a...
or
a
boycott
of
israel
or...
this
is
a
classic
use
of
force
and
extortion
in
the
organized
crime
setting.
the
use
of
force
or
threats
to
take
over
a
labor
union
or
a
business--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
let
me--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it...
the
question,
it
seems
to
me,
was
answered
in
part
by
this
court
in
the
earlier
now
case
by
saying
that
the
extortionist
doesn't
have
to
gain
a
financial
benefit
or
take
possession.
now,
the...
the
robbery
and
larceny
statutes
at
common
law
required
the
taking
and
acquiring
of
possession.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's...
that's
part
of
it,
yes.
and
the
answer
to
the
question
about
obtaining--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there...
there
is
a
stopping
point,
is
whether
at
the
end
of
the
day,
through
the
threats
or
the...
the
actions
of
the
extortionist,
that
property
interest
that
was
held
by
the
victim
of
the
extortion
has
been
transferred
to
the
hands
of
the
extortionist
in
the
sense
that
the
aim
has
been
accomplished.
the
aim
was
to
shut
down
the
clinics.
that
was
the
attempt,
and
to
the
extent
that
that
was
or
was
attempted
to
be
accomplished,
that
control--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we...
we
have
not
addressed
that,
justice
o'connor.
i
do--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
do...
i
do
agree.
i
think
that
it
would
have
to
be
sent
back
to
the
seventh
circuit
for
a
remand
to
examine
that
question.
the
jury
instruction
did
have
the
component
to
which
you
refer
which
we
would
characterize
as
a
liberty
interest
of
a
right
of
an
individual.
and
that
was--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
that...
i
think
that
at
the
end
of
the
day,
although
we
haven't
briefed
it
and
the
government
is
interested
in
the
definition
of
extortion,
at
the
end
of
the
day
that
might
have
to
be
the
result
because
the
general...
generalized
verdict
does
not
make
a
distinction
between
that
which
we
contend
is
property
right
which
was
obtained
by
the
extortionist
or...
or
was
attempted
to
be
obtained--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's...
no,
i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i...
the
question
presented,
in
connection
with
the
hobbs
act,
i
think
is
answered
this
way.
where
unlawful...
which
this
court
should
articulate,
we
hope,
in
its
opinion.
where
unlawful
force
is
used
to
arrest
sufficient
control
of
a
business
to
stop
the
performance
of
its
services,
the
hobbs
act
has
been
violated
because
control
of
the
business,
a
property
right
has
been
acquired.
i...
i
may
have
1
minute
left
to
just
mention
one
thing
with
respect
to
the...
the
rico
provision.
congress
created
a
private
right
to
damages
for
rico
violations
by
intentionally
copying
language
from
the
antitrust
laws
that
this
court
had
repeatedly
held
did
not
confer
a
right
to
seek
injunctive
relief.
this
court
has
said
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
antitrust
history,
was
copying
it,
intended
to
copy
it,
and
was
presumed
to
know
the
consequences
of
what
congress
was
doing.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
section
16.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
may
i
answer
that,
justice
stevens?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
context
of
the
language
that
the...
that
congress
knew
would
not
create
a
right,
and
knowing...
congress
knowing
that
section
16
did
specifically
create
such
a
right,
and
knowing
that
this
court
had
said
that
when
a
right
is
created
and
remedies
specifically
provided,
the
court...
the
court
will
not
expand.
the
court
will
accept
what
congress
has
done.
and
congress
did
not
adopt
and
in
fact
rejected
the
opportunities
or...
or
failed
to
accept
the
opportunities
to
adopt
precisely
the
remedy
that
would
have
had
that
result.
