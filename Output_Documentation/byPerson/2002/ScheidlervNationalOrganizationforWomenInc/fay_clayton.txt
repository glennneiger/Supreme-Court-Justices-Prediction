ms.
fay
clayton
justice
stevens,
and...
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
rico
issue,
if
i
may,
and
then
turn
to
the
hobbs
act
questions.
the
stark
contrasts
between
the
antitrust
law
and
rico
prove
the...
prove
why
private
injunctions
are
available.
when
it
comes
to
damages,
we
agree
that
the
language
is
virtually
the
same,
treble
damages
and
so
forth.
but
when
you
look
at
the
injunction
provisions,
they
are
radically
different.
in
the
antitrust
law,
sherman
iv,
all
the
injunction
provisions
were
put
in
a
single
paragraph
giving
the
government
the
exclusive
duty
to
enforce.
that
is
not...
that
was
not
copied
in
rico.
in
rico,
congress
took
out
permanent
injunctions,
put
them
in
section
1964(a),
a
separate,
unrestricted
section.
not
only
did
it
give
the
duty
to
the
government,
it
didn't
even
mention
the
government.
ms.
fay
clayton
no,
your
honor.
ms.
fay
clayton
justice
scalia,
of
course,
you
are
correct
about
section
(c).
section
(c)
does
give
standing
to
private
parties,
and
gives
them
these
extraordinary
new
remedies,
treble
damages
and
legal
fees,
which
they
could
never
get
without
a
statutory
grant.
but
section
(b)
does
not
give
the
government
the
right
to
use
permanent
injunctions.
it
only
talks
about
preliminary
relief.
it
takes
that
one
section
of
sherman
iv
out,
and
the
other
part,
the
permanent
injunctions
in
sherman
iv,
are
now,
under
rico,
put
in
a
wholly
different
provision,
the
unrestricted
section
(a).
the
natural
reading
of
section
(a),
which
says
all
these
permanent
remedies,
including
the
injunction
that
our
trial
court
granted
here,
went
against
future
criminal
activity.
section
(a)
in
an...
unrestricted
language
makes
that
available
to
the
court
to
restrain
violations
of
section
1962,
the
very
violations
that
section
(c)--
ms.
fay
clayton
--that's
a
question
that
we
have
pondered
for
a
long
time,
and...
and
i
think
the
motorola
brief,
which
explains...
a
very
important
brief...
why
preliminary
injunctions
should
be
available
to
everybody,
makes
a
good
argument
for
that.
but
we
don't
have
to
address
that
question
here.
my
own
thinking
is
that
section
(b)
gives
the
government
something
that
it
wouldn't
have
had
without
the
statutory
grant
because
preliminary
injunctions
require
one...
one
element
that
permanent
ones
don't,
the
irreparable
harm
to
the
victim.
and
the
government,
suing
as
sovereign,
doesn't
have
property
that's
harmed.
and
if
you
look
at
the
wollersheim
case,
they
recognize
that
was
a
plausible
reason
for
why
section
(b)
is
there.
ms.
fay
clayton
that's
right.
ms.
fay
clayton
that's
right.
ms.
fay
clayton
your
honor,
it
doesn't...
excuse
me,
justice
scalia.
section
(b)
does
not
say
the
attorney
general
may
institute
proceedings
under
section
1964(a).
it
says
under
this
section
which
is
section--
ms.
fay
clayton
--it
means
section
1964
as
a
whole,
your
honor,
and
in
section
(c)
private
parties
are
given
the
right
to
sue,
which
is
another
way
of
saying
the
very
same
thing.
in
fact--
ms.
fay
clayton
institute
proceedings,
sue
for
in
the
other.
and
the
court
said
both
of
them
mean
both
the
government
and
private
parties
may
go
and
get
injunctive
relief
including
divestiture.
it's
just
two
ways
of
saying
the
same
thing.
the
government
is
thought
to
institute
proceedings.
it's
bringing
them
as
a
sovereign.
private
parties
are
suing
for.
it's
just
the
traditional
language.
certainly
those
phrases
don't
bear
the
weight
of
the
argument
that
institute
proceedings
means
this
party
and
only
this
party
has
access
to
those
unrestricted
remedies
of
section
1964(a).
ms.
fay
clayton
well,
justice
breyer,
even
if
someone
made
a
mistake,
the
bill,
as
it
stands,
is
what
congress
voted
on,
and
what
the
president
signed.
it
is
that
bill
that
we
interpret.
and
we
all
agree...
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
that--
ms.
fay
clayton
--i
know
you
are,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
perhaps
the
only
thing.
and
you've
often
commented
on
how
there
are
probably
as
many
reasons
for
congressional
action
or
inaction
as
there
are
members
of
congress.
but
the
fact
is
the
bill
makes
a
very...
it's
a
very
radically
different
structure
from
the
antitrust
law.
private...
i
mean,
permanent
injunctions
are
unrestricted,
and
under
the
traditional
jurisprudence,
califano...
when
we...
we
assume
all
traditional
remedies
are
available
unless...
unless
there's
the
clearest
command.
there's
not
even
a
hint
here.
maybe
it
was
a
mistake.
it
was
certainly
not
a
clear
command
to
do
the
opposite.
and
as
my...
petitioners
have
pointed
out,
the
only
time
private
injunctions
were
voted
on,
they
passed
unanimously.
why
didn't
they
put
it
in
there?
i
think
it
would
have
been
redundant,
and
the
court
doesn't
like
surplusage.
if
they
had
said
in
section
(c),
and
private
parties
can
get
permanent
injunctions,
then
the
courts
would
have
been
trying
to
figure
out,
well,
what
did
they
mean
in
section
(a).
that
has
to
mean
something
different.
they
didn't
say
again
the
government
could
get
permanent
injunctions
in
section
(b).
that
would
have
been
redundant
too.
but
everybody
agrees
the
government
can
get
permanent
injunctions.
in
any
event,
this
court's
jurisprudence
teaches
us--
ms.
fay
clayton
--the
scheidler
brief,
the
opening
brief,
says
that
section
(b)
gives
the
government
unrestricted
access
to
the
remedies
in
section
(a).
that's
the
way
they've
put
it.
i
don't
read...
if...
if
that's
the
case
for
the
government,
the
same
applies
to
private
parties.
by
parity
of
reasoning,
anyone
with
standing...
and
it's
strict
standing
for
private
parties.
you've
got
to
be
injured
in
your
business
or
property.
ms.
fay
clayton
justice
scalia,
it's
not
automatic.
the
court
in
its
discretion
might
do
it
or
might
not,
but
it
must--
ms.
fay
clayton
--it's
been
in
the
hands
of
private
parties
under
the
antitrust
law
for
more
than
a
half
century
before
rico
was
passed,
and
the
courts
have
had
no
problem
exercising
their
discretion
to
my
knowledge.
in
fact,
in
the
american
stores
case,
this
court
pointed
out
how
the
very
same
remedy
sought
by
the
government
and
sought
by
private
parties,
the
government
might
get
it,
and
the
private
party
might
not.
furthermore,
any...
any
injunctive
relief--
ms.
fay
clayton
--and
then
i
think
the
court
wouldn't
grant
it
to
the
private
party,
and
they
certainly
wouldn't
grant
it
unless
it
was
designed
to
remedy
the
particular
injury
that
the
private
party
suffered
to
their
business
and
property
by
virtue
of
a
1962
violation.
it
would
be
very
strange,
indeed,
your
honor,
to
remove
from
private
parties
who
are
deputized
to
be
a...
private
attorneys
general,
supplement
the
government
resources,
to
take
away
this
powerful
core
injunctive
remedy
and
instead
make
them
sue
for
treble--
ms.
fay
clayton
--no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
district
courts
are--
ms.
fay
clayton
--the
court
would
only
do
that
in
an
extreme
case,
i
am
sure.
maybe
they
would
never
give
it
to
a
private
party,
but
it
would
be
up
to
the...
but
the
private
party
may
seek
it.
section
(a)
doesn't
say
they
automatically
get
it.
ms.
fay
clayton
i...
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
even
though
that's
not
an
issue
that
the
court
has
to
resolve
in
this
case,
i
think
the
motorola
brief
makes
an
excellent
case
for
why...
since
this
is
a
very
special
remedy,
it's
not
an
exclusive
list.
congress
didn't
mean
to
deprive
private
parties
or
anyone
else
of
any
of
the
traditional
remedies.
the
califano
rule
is
clear.
unless
there's
a
clear
command
to
deny
it,
it's
available.
i
don't
think
section
(b)...
remember,
it
doesn't
even
have
that
duty
language.
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
when
the
antitrust
laws
were
written,
there
was
no
merger
of
law
in
equity.
to
go
in...
when
someone
had
a
right
to
get
damages,
they
had
to
go
into
the
law
court
which
could
only
give
money
damages.
it
couldn't
give
injunctions.
that
had
changed
by
the
time
rico
passed.
and
congress
knew
that.
congress
knew
the
federal
courts
had
the
ability
to
design
any
appropriate
remedy
to
fix
the
wrong,
barring
the
clearest
command.
there's
no
clearest
command.
ms.
fay
clayton
but
they
were
passed
unanimously.
they
didn't
get
in
i
believe
because
it
would
have
been
surplusage.
it
would
have
been
redundant,
and
we
don't
like
that
in
statutes.
ms.
fay
clayton
we
don't
know,
your
honor,
and
we
can...
and
as
the
court
has
said
in
central
bank
and
solid
waste,
one
never...
it's
a
thin
reed
to
rest
an
interpretation
on
what
congress
might
have
had--
ms.
fay
clayton
--well,
i
think
that's
what
representative
steiger
said.
the...
in
fact,
we
quoted
him.
it's
ambiguous.
ms.
fay
clayton
but
it's
certainly
not
the
clear
command
to
the
contrary.
ms.
fay
clayton
i'd
like
to
turn
to
it.
thank
you,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
fay
clayton
i
would
like
to
turn
to
those.
i
think
we
all
agree
that
property
includes
both
tangible
things
and
intangible
things.
of
course,
in
this
information
age,
some
of
our
most
important
property
is
intangible.
so
the
question,
of
course,
is
how
does
one
obtain
it.
one
obtains
it
by
obtaining
control
over
it
or
dominion
over
it,
as
this
court
explained
in
the
carpenter
and
green
case.
remember
in
carpenter...
now,
this
is
a
mail
fraud
case
that
had
the
same
phrase,
obtain
property.
mr.
winans,
the
wall
street
journal
reporter,
the
on
the
street
column,
was
held
to
have
wrongfully
obtained
property.
now,
he
had
already
received
the
information.
ms.
fay
clayton
no.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
we
do
not
believe...
but
sometimes
they--
ms.
fay
clayton
--your
honor,
the
verdict
here
is
based
only
on
property.
if
you
look
at
the
hobbs
act
instruction,
it
required
that
the
respondents
be
made
to
part
with
property,
not
part
with
liberty
interests.
if
a
newspaper
publishes
an
editorial,
it
has
a
liberty
interest,
a
first
amendment
right,
to
do
it,
but
it
also
has
a
property
right.
ms.
fay
clayton
right.
ms.
fay
clayton
right.
ms.
fay
clayton
oh,
no.
ms.
fay
clayton
no,
no.
no,
your
honor.
what
we
believe
is
that
to
find
property
in
any
one
of
those
aspects
of
property...
there
are
three
aspects
of
property:
the
clinic's
right
to
control
its
equipment
and
buildings
and
so
forth,
the
women's
right
to
spend
their
money,
and
the
contract
among...
between
the
two
parties.
extortion
of
any
one
of
them
proximately
injures
all
of
them
because
it's
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
if
the
clinic
is
forcibly...
through
threats
of
violence,
the
clinic
is
forcibly
closed,
now
the
women
who
have
appointments,
which
are
contracts,
bilateral
contracts,
they
can't
get
in.
it's
a...
it's
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
so
to
extort
the
property
of
the
clinic
is
to
proximately
injure
the
women
in
her
business
or
property,
which
is...
the
standing
comes
under
rico.
this
is
something
that
petitioners
have
never
even
challenged
at
the
trial
court--
ms.
fay
clayton
--it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
fay
clayton
it
is
under
these
circumstances
where
she
has
an
actual
agreement
with
the...
the
clinic.
she's
not
just
going
shopping.
each
woman
who
went
to
these
clinics
had
an
actual
appointment
for
a
particular
service
at
a
particular
time.
when
i
have
an
appointment
with
my
doctor
for
a
biopsy,
i
have
a
property
right
in
seeing
my
doctor
at
that
time.
ms.
fay
clayton
just
as
in
the
carpenter
case,
you've
obtained
control
of
the
right
to
do
business
and
the
intangible
rights
that
come
out
of
business,
the
exclusive
rights.
ms.
fay
clayton
when
one
uses
a
demand
to
make
one
cede
their
control
over
property...
this
is
my
pen.
this
is
my
property.
it
has
ink
and
plastic.
but
i
also
have
a
right
to
use
it
for
writing.
and
if
someone
puts
a
gun
to
my
head
and
says,
if
you
use
that
pen,
i'll
shoot
you,
they
have
taken
my
property.
they've
taken
my
control.
ms.
fay
clayton
you
have
obtained
control.
ms.
fay
clayton
your
honor,
in
the
florida
prepaid
case,
in
the
craft
case,
in
the
drye
case,
this
court
made
crystal
clear
the
essence
of
intangible...
and,
for
that
matter,
tangible
property
is
the
rights
that
come
out
of
it,
especially
the
right
of
control.
the
right
to
control
my
pen,
the
right
of
the
clinics
to
control
their--
ms.
fay
clayton
--absolutely.
ms.
fay
clayton
right.
ms.
fay
clayton
i'd
like
to
address
those,
justice
breyer.
let's
start
with
the
soda
joke...
jerk
example.
martin
luther
king
didn't
tell
his
followers
to
go
into
the
woolworth's
and
bash
the
people
around
and
forcibly
prevent
the
white
people
from
getting
service.
ms.
fay
clayton
it--
ms.
fay
clayton
--not
true.
ms.
fay
clayton
justice
scalia,
that
is
not
correct.
we...
the
instruction
required
that
the
respondents
be
made
to
give
up
property.
we...
and...
and
question
12
ensured
that
a
mere
blockade
or
sit-in...
question
6
on
the
jury
form
asked
the
jury
if
any
of
the
predicate
acts
they
found
was
based
on
a
mere
blockade
and
sit-in.
the
jury
said
no.
i
told
the
jury
don't
include
in
your
predicate
acts...
i
told
them...
anything
that
was
based
on
mere
speech,
or
mere
presence,
or
the
message.
it
had
to
be
something
that
involved
force
or
violence,
the
wrongful
use
of
fear--
ms.
fay
clayton
--no,
your
honor.
if
the
jury
had
found
a
mere...
first
of
all,
that
was
argument.
the
jury
follows
instructions
not
argument,
as
the
weeks
case
from
this
court
has
held.
but
the
evidence
supported--
ms.
fay
clayton
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
fay
clayton
when
we
made...
we
made
that
argument,
but
we
also
told
the
jury
that
if
they
were
basing
any
predicate
acts
on
the
mere
presence
and
a
mere
blockade,
mere
sit-in,
they
had
to
put
yes
to
question
6.
they
put
no
because
we
showed
them
that
they
had
to
find
that
any
predicate
act
needed
an
element
of
force
or
violence.
and
that's
what
plan
did.
it
used
these--
ms.
fay
clayton
--yes,
your
honor,
by...
by
wrongful
means.
that's
correct.
ms.
fay
clayton
i'd
like...
yes,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
carpenter
case.
mr.
winans
had
the
information,
but
then
he
wrongfully
obtained
it.
how
did
he
wrongfully
obtain
it?
when
he
exercised
dominion
or
control
over
it.
this
court
said
he...
he
wrongfully
obtained
it
when
he
deprived...
that
was
this
court's
word...
deprived
the
journal
of
its
right
to
control
that
property.
in
the
green
case,
the
same
way.
the--
ms.
fay
clayton
--i
would,
your
honor,
if
she
had
been
doing
it
to
get
consent,
to
get
the
business
to
change
its
ways,
which
i
guess
she
was.
yes,
that's
not
the
lawful
way.
if
my
client,
the
national
organization
for
women,
organized
people
to
go
to
augusta
golf
course
and
tear
up
the
greens
until
they
let
women
members,
that
would
be
extortion.
ms.
fay
clayton
your
honor,
the
hobbs
act
doesn't
give
exemptions
for
motives,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
held.
there's
no
more
a
motive
requirement
there
than
there
is
under
rico.
ms.
fay
clayton
oh,
no,
i
don't
believe
i
said
that.
ms.
fay
clayton
the...
the
petitioners
had
offered
a
definition
of...
of
extortion
that
was
part
with
property,
and
they
didn't
define
it.
so
at
the
trial...
at
the
pretrial
stage,
that
was
all
they
offered.
they
didn't
object
then.
during
the
course
of
trial,
they
made
numerous
objections.
i
can't
say
they
never
objected.
they
didn't
timely
object.
and
their
original
view
of
what
extortion
meant
was
part
with
property,
which
is
the
same
i
think
as
give
up
property.
ms.
fay
clayton
the
difference
is
whether
property
is
being
attacked.
when
you
coerce
somebody
to
give
up
their
first
amendment
right,
that
might
be
coercion,
but
since
it's
not
focused
on
property,
it's
not
extortion.
ms.
fay
clayton
to
stop
speaking.
you
don't
have
property
in
your
speech.
liberty
interests
are
not
the
subject
of
extortion,
but...
but
property
interests
are.
every
extortion
is
a
coercion.
ms.
fay
clayton
not
quite,
justice
souter.
i
certainly
agree
that
the...
that
the
sit-in
protesters
were
not
extorting
anybody
because
they
were
trying
to
change
people's
mind
by
persuasion,
not
by
intimidation.
but
i
believe
if
you
look
at
the
old--
ms.
fay
clayton
--they--
ms.
fay
clayton
--but...
okay,
that...
that
may
be
right.
but
when
we
look
at
the
old
organized
crime,
the
classic
organized
crime
extortion
cases
that
the
hobbs
act
was
based
on,
we
see
organized
crime
going
in
saying,
let
these
people
run
your
pension
fund.
don't
do
business
with
these
people.
fire
these
people.
hire
those.
any
attempt
to
control
a
lawful
business
decision
i
believe
is
extortion,
whether
it's
positive
or
negative.
ms.
fay
clayton
but
the
proper...
excuse
me,
justice
souter.
the
best
way
to
address
the
first
amendment
issue
is
to
apply
the
standards
of
claiborne
hardware
to
any
extortion
at
conduct,
as
was
done
here.
make
sure
that
the
petitioners
had
to
have
specific
intent
that
the
crime
be
done.
make
sure
it
was
done
knowingly,
willingly,
wrongfully,
not
just
accidentally.
make
sure
the
enterprise
authorized
or
ratified
it.
those
were
the
instructions
given
here.
there
was...
nothing
could
be
a
predicate
act
unless
all
those
tests
were
met.
and
then
on
top
of
that,
they
had
to
use
demands,
wrongful
demands,
to
control
lawful
business
decisions.
and
i
do
believe
that
decisions
either
to
do
something
or
not
to
do
something,
as
long
as
the
business
owner...
say
the
company
makes
round
widgets
and
square
widgets.
and
the...
the
extortionist
says,
we
don't
like
round
widgets.
we
want
you
to
only
make
the
other
kind.
or
maybe
they
don't
make
round
and
they
want
them
to
start
doing
it.
that's
as
much
a
control
of
their
business
decisions
as
all
those
classic
organized
crimes
that
were
the
basis
of
the
hobbs
act.
and
it's
just
as
offensive
here.
your
honor,
we
ask
the
clock
not
to
turn
back
the...
ask
the
court
not
to
turn
back
the
clock
on
50
years
of
hobbs
act
jurisprudence
which
protected
businesses
and
their
customers
in
making
their
lawful
business
decisions.
we
ask
the
court
to
decline
to
add
any
limitations
like
tangible
or
personal
to...
to
the
hobbs
act.
by
the
way,
even
if
you
did,
the
state
law--
ms.
fay
clayton
--and
of
course.
enmons...
and
it's
section
(c),
your
honor.
it's
section
(c)
of
1951
that
says
nothing
in
this
law
will
affect...
and
then
they
list
all
the
labor
laws.
that's
why
there's
a
union
exception.
plus
the...
the
new
york
and
all
the
other
states
had
not
only
a
statutory
labor
exception,
but
common
law.
and
please
don't--
ms.
fay
clayton
--thank
you.
thank
you,
your
honors.
