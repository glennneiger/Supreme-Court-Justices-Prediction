well,
you
wouldn't
want
us
to
send
it
back
without
resolving
the
extortion
issue,
would
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
want
us
to
send
it
back
so
it
is...
it
is...
the
jury
is
given
a
charge
only
on
the
extortion
theory
that
you're...
that
you're
delivering.
then
it
comes
back
up
and
then
we
will
resolve
the
issue.
chief

have
the

01-1118,
joseph
scheidler
versus
the
national
organization
for
women
and
a
companion
case.
the
respondents,
the
national
organization
for
women
and
two
health
care
centers
that
perform
abortions
filed
suit
against
petitioners,
the
pro-life
action
network
joseph
scheidler
and
others
that
oppose
legal
abortion.
respondents
alleged
that
petitioners
violated
the
civil
provisions
of
the
racketeer
influence
and
corrupt
organizations
act,
known
as
rico
by
participating
in
a
nationwide
conspiracy
to
shut
down
abortion
clinics.
our
jury
found
that
petitioners
violated
rico
by
conducting
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
that
included
violations
of
the
hobbs
act,
state
extortion
law,
and
the
travel
act.
the
jury
awarded
damages
to
the
clinics
and
the
district
court
entered
a
permanent
nationwide
injunction
against
petitioner.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed.
the
court
concluded
that
petitioners
had
committed
extortion
as
prohibited
by
the
hobbs
act.
we
granted
certiorari
to
answer
two
questions:
first,
whether
petitioners
committed
extortion
within
the
meaning
of
the
hobbs
act?
second,
whether
private
litigants
may
obtain
injunctive
relief
in
the
civil
rico
action.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit.
we
hold
the
petitioners
did
not
commit
extortion
because
they
did
not
obtain
property
from
respondents
as
required
by
the
hobbs
act.
we
further
hold
that
this
determination
renders
insufficient
the
other
predicate
acts
supporting
the
jury’s
finding
the
petitioners
violated
rico.
therefore,
we
do
not
reach
the
question
of
injunctive
relief
under
rico.
the
hobbs
act
defines
extortion
as
the
obtaining
of
property
from
another
with
his
consent
induced
by
wrongful
use
of
actual
or
threatened
force,
violence
or
fear,
or
under
color
of
official
right.
congress
used
two
sources
of
law
as
models
in
formulating
the
act.
the
penal
code
of
new
york
and
the
field
code,
a
19th
century
model
penal
code.
both
sources
define
extortion
as
the
obtaining
of
property
from
another.
new
york’s
obtaining
requirement
entailed
both
a
deprivation
of
the
owner
and
an
acquisition
by
the
defendant
of
property.
we
have
likewise
construed
the
extortion
provisions
of
the
hobbs
act
to
require
both
the
deprivation
and
the
acquisition
of
property.
there
is
no
dispute
that
petitioners
interfered
with
disrupted
and
in
some
instances
deprived
respondents
of
their
ability
to
exercise
their
property
rights.
but
even
when
petitioners
achieve
their
goal
of
shutting
down
a
clinic
that
performed
abortions
they
did
not
commit
extortion
because
they
did
not
obtain
respondents’
property.
to
conclude
otherwise,
would
effectively
discard
the
statutory
requirement
that
property
must
be
obtained
from
another
replacing
with
a
notion
that
merely
interfering
with
or
depriving
someone
of
property
is
sufficient
to
constitute
extortion.
with
this
distinction
clearly
drawn,
congress’
decision
to
include
extortion
as
a
violation
of
the
hobbs
act
and
omit
coercion
which
is
a
related
offense
is
significant
here
as
is
the
fact
that
the
acts
predecessor,
the
anti
racketeering
act
prohibited
both
crimes.
the
omission
of
coercion
is
particularly
significant
given
that
a
paramount
congressional
concern
and
drafting
the
hobbs
act
back
in
1946
was
to
be
clear
about
what
conduct
was
prohibited
and
to
carefully
define
the
act’s
key
terms.
thus,
while
coercion
and
extortion
overlap,
there
has
been
and
continues
to
be
a
recognized
difference
between
these
crimes
and
because
the
hobbs
act
is
criminal
statute,
it
must
be
strictly
construed
and
any
ambiguity
must
be
resolved
in
favor
or
lenity.
we
also
hope
that
our
determination
of
the
hobbs
act
extortion
renders
insufficient
the
other
predicate
acts
of
racketeering
supporting
the
jury’s
conclusion
that
petitioners
violated
rico.
whereas,
here
the
model
penal
code
and
the
majority
of
states
recognized
the
crime
of
extortion
as
requiring
a
party
to
obtain
or
to
seek
to
obtain
property
as
the
hobbs
act
requires,
a
state
extortion
offense
for
rico
purposes
must
have
a
similar
requirement.
thus,
because
petitioner
did
not
obtain
or
attempt
to
obtain
a
respondents
property,
the
state
extortion
claims
were
fatally
flawed.
likewise,
the
travel
act
violations
which
were
committed
in
furtherance
of
extortionate
conduct
failed
because
petitioners
did
not
commit
extortion.
because
this
predicate
acts
supporting
the
juries
finding
of
a
rico
violation
must
be
reversed,
the
judgment
of
petitioners
violated
rico
must
also
be
reversed.
without
an
underlying
rico
violation
the
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court
must
be
vacated.
we
therefore
need
not
address
the
question
of
whether
a
private
plaintiff
may
obtain
injunctive
relief
under
rico.
