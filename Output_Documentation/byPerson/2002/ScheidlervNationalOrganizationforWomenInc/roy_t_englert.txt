mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
the
court
in
a
remarkable
posture.
if
you
agree
with
the
hobbs
act
arguments
in
the
blue
briefs,
you
should
reverse
the
jury
verdicts
and
direct
entry
of
judgment
for
the
defendants.
but
even
if
you
believe
the
arguments
in
the
red
and
gray
briefs,
you
should
still
reverse,
but
for
a
new
trial.
and
whatever
you
do
on
the
hobbs
act,
you
should
reverse
the
rico
injunction
because
rico
simply
does
not
authorize
private
injunctive
relief.
now,
why
do
i
say
so
starkly
that
even
respondents
and
the
government's
theories
require
reversal
of
the
jury
verdict?
because
the
attempts
in
those
briefs,
to
salvage
the
theory
of
plaintiffs'
case,
concede
that
someone
must
obtain
the
victim's
property
for
the
offense
of
extortion
to
be
shown.
and
the
whole
reason
the
court
granted
cert
on
the
hobbs
act
issue
was
to
review
the
seventh
circuit's
holding
directly
contrary
to
those
concessions
that,
quote,
a
loss
to,
or
interference
with
the
rights
of
the
victim
is
all
that
is
required,
closed
quote.
likewise,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
all
it
had
to
find
was
that
the
defendants
caused
someone,
quote,
to
give
up
a
property
right,
closed
quote.
you
will
find
in
the
red
and
gray
briefs
very
elaborate
efforts
to
suggest
meanings
of
obtain
and
property
under
which
the
record
in
this
case
supposedly
could
support
a
finding
that
petitioners
obtained
some
abstract
form
of
property
from
the
clinics
or
women.
but
no
defense
of
the
seventh
circuit's
holding
and
the
jury
instructions
that
substituted
the
phrases,
interference
with
and
give
up
for
obtaining.
so
there
ought
to
be
no
question
that
some
form
of
reversal
is
required.
now,
the
reason
why
there
should
be
reversal
for
the
entry
of
judgment
for
the
defendants,
and
not
just
for
a
new
trial,
is
that
respondents
and
the
government's
brief-formulated
conceptions
of
obtaining
and
property
are
wrong.
the
essence
of
the
theories
is
that
petitioners
obtained
control
over
the
use
and
disposition
of
clinic
assets.
to
refer
to
that
as
obtaining
property
of
another...
the
language
of
the
hobbs
act...
is
an
awfully
broad
use
of
language.
it's
a
far
cry
from
the
new
york
law
on
which
the
hobbs
act
was
based.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
respectfully,
it's
not.
my
clients
don't
have
the
clinic's
property
today
as
they
would
if
they
had,
in
fact,
obtained
it.
they
may
have
temporarily
interfered
with
some
use
of
it.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
is
a
sense
of
the
word
obtain,
but
it's
not
the
sense
relevant
for
interpreting
the
hobbs
act
for
several
reasons.
one
is
the
hobbs
act
has
historical
predecessors
that
this
court
has
said
should
be
looked
to
in
interpreting
its
terms.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
i
certainly
don't...
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
i
certainly
don't
concede
it's
a
relevant
sense
of
obtain.
because
of...
because
of
the
hobbs
act
historical
antecedents,
because
of
the
rule
of
lenity,
because
of
the
very
odd
use
of
language,
for
all
those
reasons,
that's
not
how
the
court
should
interpret
obtain.
but
more
important
than
any
of
those
things
is
the
implications
of
such
a
theory.
when
carry
nation
went
into
saloons
with
her
axe
and
destroyed
property,
she
certainly
interfered
with
the
property
owner's
unfettered
use
and
control
over
disposition
of
his
assets,
and
that's
exactly
what
she
intended
to
do.
was
that
extortion?
the
civil
rights
boycott
of
white
merchants
that
the
court
considered
in
claiborne
hardware
certainly
affected
the
ability
of
the
boycotted
merchants
to
use
their
property
and
involved
isolated
acts
of
violence
as
well.
these
aren't
hypothetical
concerns.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
but
were
the
court
to
uphold
the
theory
in
the
red
and
gray
briefs,
which
wouldn't
support
the
judgment,
but
if
the
court
were
to
uphold
that
theory,
it
certainly
could
be
charged
the
next
time
the
facts
of
claiborne
hardware
come
along.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
my...
that's
correct,
of
course,
justice
stevens.
but
my
fundamental
point
is
not
that
one
case
was
or
wasn't
charged
as...
as
extortion.
it's
if
you
uphold
the
theory
of
the
red
and
gray
briefs,
it
can
be
charged
as
extortion
in
the
future.
and
that's
actually
happened
to
people
for
the
ethical
treatment
of
animals.
it's
happened
to
other
animal
rights
groups.
because
of
these
implications,
the
southern
christian
leadership
conference
joined
the
amicus
brief
of
the
seamless
garment
network
at
the
cert
stage.
disability
rights
groups
that
conduct
protests
have
joined
the
seamless
garment
network
brief
at
the
merits
stage.

daniel
and
philip
berrigan,
nat
hentoff,
martin
sheen--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--oh,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
oh,
yes.
trespass.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
oh,
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there's
never
been
any
doubt
in
this
case--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--we
are
not
talking
about
extortion,
but
we
are
talking
about
some
things
that
could
be
punished
much
less
severely.
it
has
never
been
disputed
in
this
case,
from
the
opening
statement
through
the
closing
statement
of
the
trial
or
in
the
earlier
phases
of
the
case,
that
there
were
trespasses.
there
could
be
in
particular
circumstances--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
fair
enough
except
the...
the
jury
verdict
really
is
quite
at
rejection
of
petitioners'
proof
in
many
respects
rather
than
supporting
it.
but,
yes,
justice
o'connor.
i
really
don't
want
to
fight
with
you
on
that
particular
point.
but...
but
let's--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
but
that's
why
i
used
the
examples
of
carry
nation
and
claiborne
hardware
which
weren't
pure
speech
either.
there
was
certainly
violence
in
those
cases,
but
not
extortion.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
and
that's
a
very
important
point
supporting
our
position
because
congress
at
one
point
had
coercion
as
a
predicate
act
in
the
anti-racketeering
act
of
1934
and,
at
the
request
of
organized
labor,
took
it
out.
in
the
hobbs
act,
in
the
passage
of
the
hobbs
act
in
1946,
again,
organized
labor
lobbied
to
make
sure
that
coercion
was
not
part
of
the
hobbs
act.
coercion
is
a
different
crime
from
extortion,
and
interfering
with
someone's
rights
is
the
crime
of
coercion
under
the
model
penal
code,
under
new
york
law,
under
various
other
bodies
of
law,
but
it's
not
the
crime
of
extortion.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
it's
a
stretch,
justice
kennedy,
but
even
if
it
weren't
a
stretch,
it
still
wouldn't
be
a
hobbs
act
violation
for
a
different
reason.
there
must
be
consent
to
the
obtaining
of
property
or...
of
another,
and
simply
going
in
and
engaging
in
adverse
possession
doesn't
necessarily
entail
consent.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
that
actually--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes.
words
can
be
stretched
to
make
lots
of
things
into
lots
of
things
that
the
law
doesn't
want
them
to
be.
and
in
fact,
the
common
law
distinction
between
robbery
and
extortion,
which
are
both
hobbs
act
predicates,
is
one
is
with
consent
and
the
other
is
without.
so
robbery
is
a
classic
example
of
something
that
you
could
stretch
the
word
of
consent
to
cover,
but
it
isn't
extortion.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
breyer.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
if
it--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--in
the
hypothetical
example
you
just
gave
me,
they
most
certainly
have
obtained
property.
you
said
send
the
money
over
to
z.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--and
the
sg
is
wrong
because
that's
not
what
obtaining
property
meant
under
the
new
york
law
in
1946.
it...
it's
a
stretch
of
words.
it's
a
modern
concept
of
property.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
that's
getting
to
be
more
of
a
stretch,
but
probably
yes,
under
united
states
v.--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no.
there
is
a
major
difference,
with
respect,
justice
breyer.
saying
do
provide
services
to
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e
is
quite
different
from
saying
don't
provide
services
to
a,
b,
c--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
difference
is
that
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e
have
obtained
the
services
in
one
case
and
they
have...
and
no
one
has
obtained
any
property
in
the
other
case,
exactly
the
words
of
the
hobbs
act.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
justice
souter--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--if
i've
understood
you
correctly,
that's
even
more
support
for
our
position
because
the
words
of
the
hobbs
act
are
obtaining
of
property
from
another.
so
if
all
of
justice
breyer's
examples--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--property--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no.
with
respect,
what
is
common
is
not
control.
it's
acquisition.
it's
obtaining.
that's
what
obtaining
means.
the
solicitor
general's
own
brief
on
page
21
in
footnote
11
says
that's
what
obtaining
means.
and--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--but
control--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
apologize,
justice
souter,
for
interrupting,
but
control
is
not
property.
property
is
property.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so,
respectfully,
justice
souter.
the
distinction
i
draw
is
that
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
one
involves
obtaining
property,
and
the
other
doesn't,
on
the
assumption
that
the
services
are
property.
if
they
aren't
property,
i
win
the
case
for
a
different
reason.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i...
i
think
so,
justice
stevens,
but
the
case
is
not
immediately
coming
to
mind.
i'm
sorry.
i...
i
do
think
the
new
york
courts
construed
rather
strictly
the
obtaining
of
property,
and
the
solicitor
general's
more
expansive
cases
are
from
long
after
1946.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i'm...
i'm,
as
i
stand
here,
blanking
on
those
facts.
i...
i
believe
the
new
york
courts
did
construe
obtaining
of
property
rather
strictly
in
that
case
and
in
every
other
pre-1946
case,
but
i
can't...
i
apologize.
i
can't
give
you
an
intelligent
discussion
of
that
right
at
this
moment.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
rico
injunction
issue,
if
i
may.
it's
very
straightforward.
i
plan
to
address
it
only
briefly.
first,
this
court
has
held
in
several
cases
that
section
7
of
the
sherman
act
and
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
both
worded
almost
identically
to
section
1964(c)
of
rico,
did
not
authorize
private
injunctive
relief.
the
dissent
in
paine
lumber
contended
that
courts
had
inherent
power
to
grant
injunctions--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
very,
very
slightly
different,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
very
slightly,
but
the...
where
there's
a
world
of
difference
and
not
a
slight
difference
is
between
section
16
of
the
clayton
act
and
section
1964
of
rico.
and
in
section
16
of
the
clayton
act,
congress
authorized
private
injunctive
relief.
no
language
remotely
resembling
section
16
appears
in
section
1964
of
rico,
but
all
of
the
language
from
the
statutes
this
court
held
didn't
authorize
injunctive
relief
with
very
tiny
variations
appears
in
rico.
besides
the
obvious
statutory
language
borrowed
from
the
clayton
and
sherman
acts,
as
this
court
has
recognized
throughout
its
cases,
the
statutory
evolution
of
rico
presented
congress
with
repeated
opportunities
expressly
to
provide
private
parties
with
injunctive
relief
under
rico.
every
such
proposal
failed
before
and
after
the
final
enactment
of
rico.
the
court
below
dismissed
the
reliance
on
legislative
history
on
the
theory
that
this
court
would
not
ascribe
any
significance
to
legislative
inaction.
but
ironically
the
very
day
the
seventh
circuit
decided
this
case,
this
court
was
hearing
argument
in
chickasaw
nation
v.
united
states,
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
that
case
reiterated
the
longstanding
principle...
with
which
some
members
of
the
court
disagreed,
but
the
longstanding
principle
in
majority
opinions...
that
courts
ordinarily
will
not
assume
that
congress
intended
to
enact
statutory
language
that
it
has
earlier
discarded
in
favor
of
other
language.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it
was
actually
passed
unanimously
by
the
senate,
but
then
the
house
didn't
take
a
vote
on
it.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i...
justice
stevens,
i...
i've
misspoken
slightly.
excuse
me.
the...
the
post-rico
effort--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
pre-rico
effort
was
withdrawn.
the
pre-rico
effort
was
withdrawn
by
representative
steiger
on
the
ground
that
it
would
complicate
matters
too
much
to
take
it
up
at
that
stage
of
the
legislation,
but
it
was
very
important.
he'd
come...
come
back
again
with
it
next
year.
but
he
recognized
that
the
statute
didn't
have
private
injunctive
relief
in
it
in
his
floor
statements.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
nothing
that
sheds
tremendous
light
on
this
except
for
representative
steiger's--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--own
statements.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it
shouldn't
because,
as
is
pointed
out
at
pages
7
and
8
of
the
operation
rescue
reply
brief
and
correctly
so,
this
court
has
two
lines
of
cases:
one
when
congress
doesn't
specify
the
remedies.
that's
cases
like
franklin
v.
gwinnett
county
which
was
an
implied
right
of
action
case,
and
like
califano
v.
yamasaki.
and
a
different
line
of
cases
saying,
when
congress
does
specify
remedies,
they're
intended
to
be
exclusive.
a
line
of
cases
that...
that--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
justice
souter,
this
court
said
over
and
over
again
that
it
did
carry
that
implication
when
the
exact
same
language
was
used
in
the
sherman
and
clayton
acts.
the
paine
lumber
case,
the
d.r.
wilder
manufacturing
case,
a
whole
host
of
antitrust
cases.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
oh,
yes.
the...
the
language
of
sherman
and
clayton
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
scheidler
blue
brief--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it
is.
it
is.
the
terms
that
differ
are
quite
trivial,
and
some
sections
are
separated
into
different
subsections.
that's
about
all
the
difference
there
is.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
the
defendants
in
this
case
objected
strenuously
to
reading
the
word
obtain
out
of
the
hobbs
act.
they
did
not
say
that
giving
up
property
is
enough.
if
you
read
the
1995
opinion
wrongly
denying
the
12(b)(6)
motion,
that's
all
over
the
place.
if
you
look
at
pages
4324
to
4340
of
the
transcript
at
the
jury
colloquy,
the
point
that
there
needs
to
be
obtaining
was
made
quite
strenuously.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
at
the...
at
the
pages
i
indicated.
people
v.
barondess.
the
work
stoppage
led
to
obtaining
$100.
of
course,
it
was
extortion.
that's
the
property
in
that
case.
that's...
it's
cited
in
footnote
16
of
our
opening...
of
the
scheidler
opening
brief.
united
states
v.
cleveland
indians
baseball
company.
this
court
reminded
us
members
of
the
bar
that
the
tendency
to
assume
that
a
word
used
in
two
different
legal
rules
always
has
the
same
meaning,
has
all
the
tenacity
of
original
sin,
and
must
constantly
be
guarded
against.
to
think
that
property's
definition
in
tax
cases
and
in
fifth
amendment
takings
cases
is
necessarily
the
definition
of
the
hobbs
act
is
simply
wrong.
the
hobbs
act
draws
its
definition
of
property
from
the
common
law
and
the
new
york
law,
not
from
takings
cases
and
tax
cases.
the
first
amendment
is
in
this
case.
yes,
the
court
did
not
take
the
first
amendment
question,
but
the
principle
of
constitutional
avoidance
always
governs
the
construction
of
statutes.
and
ms.
clayton
concedes
that
classic
protest
activities
that
are
venerated
in
american
history
in
retrospect
would
be
covered
as
extortion
by
her
definition.
that
should
give
the
court
pause.
claiborne--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the...
the
answer
to
that
distinction,
if
i
may,
justice
souter,
is
claiborne
hardware
and
carry
nation...
those
fact
patterns
certainly
would
be
covered
even
under
the
distinction
you
suggest.
there
were
10
acts
of
violence
in
1966
in
claiborne
hardware.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
actually
i...
i
don't
think
that's
historically
accurate.
i
think
there
was
an
effort
to
stop
the
lunch
counters
from
serving
other
people
in
addition
to
getting
them
to...
to
serve
black
people.
but
it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it...
it...
there
are...
there
are
examples
that
this
court
should
be
concerned,
i
respectfully
submit,
about
calling
extortion
under
ms.
clayton's
definition,
and
that
would
include
the
facts
in
claiborne
hardware.
that
would
include
the
carry
nation
example.
the
seamless
garment
network
brief
goes
into
many
other
examples.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
the...
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
that
case
refers
to
it
has
having
elements
of
majesty
as
well
as
elements
of
violence.
and
the
court
really
should
be
concerned
about
whether
the
classic
historical
pattern...
and
please
look
at
the
seamless
garment
network
brief...
the
classic
historical
pattern
of
venerable
leaders
whose
followers
get
out
of
hand
is
really
what
is
meant
by
hobbs
act
extortion
and
rico.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
i--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--there's
another
more
legalistic
reason.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
if...
if
i
may,
there's
another
more
legalistic
reason
why
ms.
clayton's
and
the
solicitor
general's
position
has
to
be
wrong,
and
justice
breyer
and
others
have
laid
their
finger
on
it,
justice
ginsburg
as
well.
what
they're
talking
about
is
the
classic
example
of
coercion,
not
extortion,
and
for
those
who
like
legislative
history,
the
fact
that
organized
labor
got
coercion
out
of
the
statute
should
give
you
pause.
for
those
who
don't
like
legislative
history,
the
fact
that
there's
a
list
of
predicate
acts
and
coercion
isn't
one
of
them
should
give
you
pause.
i
think
almost
everyone
agrees
that
there
has
to
be
at
the
very
least
a
remand
in
this
case,
and
ms.
clayton
hasn't
quite
conceded
it.
but
if
this
court's
decision
in
griffin
v.
united
states,
a
criminal
case,
is
applicable
in
civil
cases
or
if
this
court's
decisions
in
yates
v.
united
states,
maryland
v.
baldwin,
sunkist
growers
are
applicable,
then
this
jury
verdict,
which
almost
indisputably
rests,
at
least
in
part,
on
indefensible
notions
of
property,
has
to
be
reversed.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.

violence.
let's
talk
about
violence
for
a
moment.
please
look
at...
at
special
interrogatory
4(e).
the
jury
was
asked
to
find
how
many
acts
or
threats
of
violence
to
persons
or
property
were
there.
the
jury
said
four.
ms.
clayton
argued
30
in
her
closing
argument,
and
the
jury
said
4.
so
actually
the
jury
rejected...
we
know
to
a
certainty
the
jury
rejected
most
of
now's
evidence,
and
there
weren't
even
any
allegations
that
mr.
scheidler,
mr.
scholberg,
or
mr.
murphy
actually
engaged
in
violence.
there
were
allegations
they
were
connected
to
violence,
not
that
they
engaged
in
violence.
and
i
should
say
my
clients
are
proponents
of
nonviolence.
mr.
terry
was
not
alleged
to
engage
in
acts
of
violence
either,
i
should
add.
rico.

section

of
the

is
repeated
almost

section

of
the
clayton

the
statute
that

nowhere
in
