justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
it's
obtaining
property
if
a
group
of
people
through
criminal
means
tell
an
owner
of
a
business
precisely
and
in
detail
how
he
has
to
run
his
business.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no?
in
other
words,
if...
if,
say,
you
have
a
group
of
terrible
criminals,
and
they
say
here
is
what...
we're
going
to
kill
you
unless
you
do
the
following,
and
then
they
say,
today
you
serve
x
and
tomorrow
you
serve
y,
and
you
send
the
money
over
to
z,
and
you
do
all
these
different
things;
in
other
words,
they
run
the
business.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
why
haven't
they
obtained
that
business?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
i
said...
say...
i
regretted
putting
that
in
the
hypothetical
the
instant
i
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
simply
looking
for
an
example
of
a
group
of
criminals
who
will
tell
a
property
owner,
a
businessman,
exactly
and
precisely
how
to
run
his
business
in
a
way
that
he
doesn't
want
to
run
it.
now,
why
isn't
that
obtaining
the
property
called
the
business?
i
mean,
that's
what
the
sg
i
think
is
suggesting
basically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
like
a
theft
of
services.
i
mean,
you
go
in
and
you...
there
was
a...
years
ago
a
person
who
figured
out
how
to
whistle
various
tones
into
the
telephone
so
that
it
would
connect
people
without
charge.
all
right.
now,
hasn't
that
person
stolen
the
use
of
the
telephone?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
and...
and
a
person
who
tells
the
telephone
company
owner,
i
want
you
to
go
and
provide
the
services
to
a,
b,
and
c,
hasn't
he
stolen
those
services?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then...
then
the
difference
between
that
and
a
person
who
tells
the
business
owner
to
provide
his
services
to
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e,
whom
he
doesn't
want
to,
that
doesn't
seem
a
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
wondered,
and
what
is
the
difference
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
says
there,
to
obtain
control.
to
obtain
control.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
what
i
don't
understand
is
whether
there
isn't
a
line
somewhere
between
obtaining
control
in
the
sense
of
taking
over
a
business
for
a
period
of
time,
shutting
down
a
business,
and
just
telling
the
owner
of
the
business
to
do
one
single
thing
once
that
the
blackmailer...
but
not
the
owner...
wants
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
a
spectrum
that
falls
within
that
word
control
or
the
word
taking
over
that
if
you
push
it
to
an
extreme,
the
hobbs
act
becomes
a
coercion
statute
in
respect
to
a
business
owner.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
where
you're
going
is
that
it
is
a
coercion
statute
in
respect
to
a
businessperson
insofar
as
you
ask
the
owner
of
the
business
to
do
something
that
he
doesn't
want
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
think
that's
too
extreme,
is
there
any
stopping
place?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i...
sorry.
--i
was
going
to
say
in
the
american
stores
case,
this
court
construed
the
very
same
language
in
the
clayton
act,
sections
15
and
16.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
looked...
i
mean,
i
couldn't
make
too
much
out
of
the
fact
that
you
take
the
language
from
the
clayton
act
which
says
the
attorney
general
may
institute
proceedings
in
equity,
and
you
move
it
to
section
(b)
and
just
change
it
to
say,
he
may
institute
proceedings
under
this
section.
that's
the
only
difference
with
the
clayton
act
that
i
could
find.
so
i
looked
up
the
history.
in
the
history,
it
looks
as
if
there
were
five
different
bills
floating
around,
and
things
didn't...
weren't
all
that
straightforward.
it
got
a
little
mixed
up.
and
you
have
in
the
house
several
congressmen
getting
up
and
saying
they
made
a
mistake
in
the
senate.
they
didn't
include
this.
they
should
have.
and
then
there
were
four
more
bills
floating
around,
and
the
ones
who
wanted
to
include
it
said,
send
it
all
to
the
judiciary
committee,
let
them
work
it
out,
and
they
never
worked
it
out.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
the
thrust
of
it
that
i...
that
i
got
out
of
that.
maybe
it
was
just
a
mistake.
well,
if
it
was
a
mistake,
you're
the...
you
have
another
law.
you
can
bring
it
under
the...
you
could
get
an
injunction
i
guess
under
the
abortion
act,
the
abortion
clinics
act,
or...
it
seemed
to
me
this
one...
they
made
a
mistake.
well,
they
made
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
have
a
long,
long
discussion
of
the
battle,
and
everybody
says,
without
any
opposition,
that
this
isn't
there.
you
would
have
thought
if
it
was
surplusage,
somebody
would
have
gotten
up
and
said,
well,
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
but
it
defined
property.
it
says
you
can
find
a
violation,
other
things...
all
the
other...
all
the
other
requirements
being
met.
you
have
to
say
that
the
doctors,
nurses,
or
other
staff
or
clinics
themselves
give
up
a
property
right.
the
term
property
right
means
anything
of
value--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--including
a
woman's
right
to
seek
services
from
the
clinic,
the
right
of
doctors
or
nurses
to
perform
their
jobs,
the
right
of
the
clinic
to
provide
medical
services
free
from
wrongful
threats.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
your
brief
i
think,
more
or
less,
seemed
to
concede
that...
that
at
least
two
out
of
those
three
parts
were
certainly
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't.
i
mean,
then...
then
do
we
have
to
decide...
is
this...
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
so...
so
in
other
words,
this
instruction
is
correct
that
it's...
it's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
a...
a
woman's
right
to
seek
services
is
property
which,
if
they
say,
i
don't
want
you,
the
clinic,
to
serve
the
woman
so
the
woman
can't
get
the
services,
that
is
obtaining
property?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
what
about
the
right
to
perform
a
job?
let's
think
of
a
labor
strike.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
think
of
the
strike,
my
goodness,
where
people
can't
get
into
the
factory.
and...
and
somebody
comes
out
and
says,
you've...
you've
interfered
under
the
hobbs
act
and
have
obtained
property;
namely,
my
right
to
perform
my
job
is
interfered
with.
the
person
at
the
soda
fountain...
you've
heard
the
litany.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
the
soda
fountain...
the
sit-ins.
the
soda
jerk
who
wouldn't
serve
the
black
customers.
well,
this...
this
is
interfering
with
my
right
to
perform
my
job.
i
mean,
this
seems...
you
have
another
statute
that
you
can
sue
under.
but
a
lot
of...
a
lot
of
people
who
don't
like
these
various
demonstrations
don't,
and
they'll
all
be
in
under
the
hobbs
act
and...
and
rico
and
so
forth.
i'm
rather
concerned
about
this
problem.
i'd
like
you
to
address
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was...
was
this
particular
instruction,
the
one
that
i
read
from
in
1998,
the
instruction
that
had
the
three
parts
to
it...
was
that
objected
to?
