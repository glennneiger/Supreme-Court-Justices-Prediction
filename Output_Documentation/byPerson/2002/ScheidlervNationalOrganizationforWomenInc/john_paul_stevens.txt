justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
case
number
01-1118,
scheidler
against
the
national
organization
of...
of
women.
you
may
proceed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that...
extortion
wasn't
charged
in
that
case,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
was
a
state
case
it
wasn't...
the
reason...
reason
it
wasn't
charged.
it
grew
up
through
the
mississippi
court
system,
if
i
remember
correctly,
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
do
with
the
new
york
case
involving
a
work
stoppage?
do
you
agree
with
that
case,
or
do
you
think
it's
wrong?
the
one
the
solicitor
general
cites
in
his
brief,
the...
the
old
1890
case
involving
a
stop...
a
strike,
i
guess,
is
what
you'd
say.
do
you
think
that
case
would...
would
be
decided
the
same
way
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
people
against
barondess,
decided
in
1892.
it
was
under
the...
under
the
new
york
statute,
which
i
think
everyone
agrees
was
the
model
for
the
federal
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
no
obtaining
in
the
very
literal
sense
that
you
used
the
term,
but
there
was
merely
acquisition
of
control
of
the
operation
in
that.
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
you
come
out
on...
on
those
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
clarify
one
thing
on
the...
on
the
rejected
amendment?
was
it
voted
down
or
withdrawn?
i
can't
remember.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
no.
i'm
talking
about
the
one
before
enactment.
the
post...
the
later
statute
is
a
little
less
persuasive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted,
a
private
litigant
could
get
relief,
injunctive
relief,
under
the
antitrust
laws,
not
under
the...
not
under
the
section
7
of
the
sherman
act,
or
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
but
under
whatever
the
other
number
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
question
is
really
whether
the
first
section
of
the
rico
gives
us
authority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
ms.
clayton.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--we
don't
agree
on
whether
they
get
it
pursuant
to
section
(a)
or
section
(b),
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--ms.
clayton,
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
i
just...
i...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
heard
you
correctly.
there's
a
definition
of
property
in
the
instructions,
a
three-part
definition,
at
page
158.
did
you
tell
us
that
that
instruction
was
not
objected
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
misunderstood
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mrs....
ms.
clayton.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
englert,
you
have
6
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
the
conduct
in
claiborne
hardware
was
pretty
rough.
maybe
it
should
have
been
included.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
one
question
about
that?
did
the
individuals
get
damages
here,
or
was
it
just
the
clinics?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
