justice

and
we
have
no
idea
what
the
jury
went
on.
there
were
three
pieces,
and
one
involved
the
people
who
worked
in
the
clinic.
one
involved
the
women
who
were
served
by
the
clinic,
and
the
third
involved
the
clinic
operation.
and
that
was
exactly
the
question
that
i
wanted
to
ask
you.
is
your
bottom
line
a
new
trial?
because
the
charge
doesn't
match
the
theory
you're
putting
forward.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
section
(a)
says
what
the
court
may
grant.
it
doesn't
say
who
has
authority
to
ask
the
court
to
do
that.
and
in
the...
the
provision
(b),
it
empowers
the
government
and
the
government
only
to
ask
for
preliminary
injunctive
relief.
it's
a
strange
thing.
why
would
congress
withhold
the
power
to
seek
a
preliminary
injunction
and
yet
give
that
party
the
right
to
seek
a
permanent
injunction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
it's
even
odder
that
they
don't...
the
private
party
can't
seek
that
preliminary
injunction
even
if
they
can
show
irreparable
injury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
carry
nation?
i...
you
would
concede,
i
take
it,
based
on
your
argument
that
if
rico
had
been
around
then
and
the
hobbs
act,
that
she
would
have
been
in
violation.

what's
the
difference
between--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
difference
between
coercion
and
extortion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--he
didn't
say
might
have.
you
said
that
you
would.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
both
sides
agree
on
carry
nation.
