but
are
we
talking
about
actions
that
constitute
the
commission
of
some
kind
of
criminal
offense
in
the
process?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
other
things,
destruction
of
property
and
so
forth,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
we're
not
talking
about
conduct
that
is
lawful
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--more
than
that.
in
some
cases,
assaults
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
think
to
paint
the
picture
that
we're
talking
about,
just
pure
speech
is...
is
not
the
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
say
coercion?
one
of
the
questions
was,
well,
coercion...
if
that's
defined
as
using
compulsion
to
force
a
person
to
do
or
not
do
something
that
she
otherwise
would
do
or
not
do,
does
this
conduct
fit
that
crime?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
crime--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
language
of
the
acts,
though,
is
a
little
different
than
this,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
analogy
may
not
be
perfect
because
the
language
differs.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr....
yes,
mr.
olson.
if...
if
we
agreed
with
your
view...
and
i'm
not
sure
we
will...
about
property
including
the
right
to
control
business
assets,
it
does
not,
i
assume,
cover
some
personal
right
of
somebody
to
obtain
services
in
the
clinic.
and
i
guess
the
jury
verdict
covered
both.
could
the
jury
verdict
be
upheld
here
even
if
the
court
agreed
with
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
asking
you
to.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
you
do
agree,
though,
i
guess
that
were
efforts
to
include
language
authorizing
the
obtaining
of
injunctions
by
private
petitioners,
and
that
was
not
adopted
by
congress.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
don't
know.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
it
includes
liberty
interest
deprivation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
what
happens
to
a
generalized
verdict
no
matter
how
you
define
this--
