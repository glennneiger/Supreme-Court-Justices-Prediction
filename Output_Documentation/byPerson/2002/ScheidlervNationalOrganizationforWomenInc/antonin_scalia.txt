justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
concede
it's
a
sense
of
the
term
obtained?
i
mean,
would
you
really
speak
of
obtaining
somebody's
property
when
you...
when
you
interfere
with
that
person's
use
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
must
wonder
why
it
wasn't
charged.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
point...
the
point
is...
the
point
is
not
whether
there's
a
first
amendment
violation
here.
the
point
is
whether
the
interpretation
of
the
word
obtain
that
the
government
is...
is
suggesting
we
adopt
does
not
threaten
to...
to
bring
us
constantly
into
difficult
situations
where
we're
going
to
have
to
try
to
sort
out
whether
that
definition
doesn't
sail
too
close
to
the
wind
with
respect
to
first
amendment
rights.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you...
do
you
agree
that
your
interpretation
would
have
been
applicable
to
the
civil
rights
sit-ins?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
agree
that
it
would
be
applicable
to
many
labor
picketing
situations--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
they
obstruct
entrance?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
exception
wasn't
with
regard
to
labor
objection.
what...
what
is
there
in
the
statute
that...
that
enables
you
to
make
an
exception
for
labor
picketing?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
language
of
the
statute
enables
you
to
separate
labor?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
said
any
legitimate
demands--
justice
antonin
scalia
--elsewhere.
it
didn't
always
limit
it
to
just
legitimate
collective
bargaining
demands,
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
that's
what
was
involved
in
the
case.
but
why
would
you
separate
legitimate
collective
bargaining
demands
from
other
legitimate
demands?
what
is
there
possibly
in
the
word
obtain
that
could
cause
you
to
separate
legitimate
collective
bargaining
demands
from
legitimate
demands
that
you...
that
you
refrain
from
doing
something
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so
you
say
we
simply
made
a
labor
law
exception
to
the
extortion
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
just...
just
out
of
nowhere,
a
labor
law
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
give
me
no
language
in
the
statute
that
would
justify
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
the
next
section,
it
did
mention
the
government
and
said
that
the
government
shall
have
the
authority
to...
to
use
the
injunctive
provisions
mentioned
in
the
first
section.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
in
the
third
section,
it
gives
private
individuals
a
right
to
damages,
but
does
not
mention
that
they
have
the
right
to
use
the
first...
first
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
just
addressing
the
second
sentence
of
section
(b).
there
is
a
first
sentence
which
says,
the
attorney
general
may
institute
proceedings
under
this
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
now--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that...
that
gives
the
attorney
general
the
power
to
institute
proceedings
under
(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
with
you
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
so
you
say
private
parties
have
the
power
to
require...
to
ask
the
court
to
order
a
person
to
divest
himself
of
any
interest,
direct
or
indirect?
do
you
know
of
any
other
situation
in
which
a
private
party
can...
can
cause
the...
the
divestiture
of
a
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
to
put
that
power
and...
and
to
request
it
in
the
hands
of
a
power...
of
a
private
party
seems
to
me
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
understand
it
in
the
context
of
the
antitrust
laws
where
the
divestiture
is
the
only
way
to
prevent
the...
the
monopolization,
but
to
use
that
as
a
punishment
for...
for
extortion
is,
it
seems
to
me,
quite...
quite
bizarre.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
divestiture...
you
say
the
divestiture
should
never
be...
should
never
be
used
by
the
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could...
could
simply
destroy
an
organization
as
the
punishment
for...
for
extortion
as
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
have
you
obtained
control
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
obtaining
control
means...
means
nothing
at
all
if...
if
whenever
you
deprive
somebody
of...
of
a
right,
you
say
you
obtain
control
of
the
right
that...
that
you've
deprived
them
of.
i
mean,
everything
becomes
an
obtaining
of
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i...
if
i
say
to
you,
don't...
don't
use
that
pen,
or
i'll
do
something
unlawful
and
you
don't
use
the
pen,
i
have
obtained
the
pen.
justice
antonin
scalia
in...
in
ordinary
parlance,
i
have
obtained
the
pen.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
just
obstructing...
just
obstructing...
you've
used
the
term
violence
several
times.
that's
not
what
the
instruction
required.
justice
antonin
scalia
as...
as
your
argument
to
the
jury
itself
indicated,
it
was
enough
if
they
obstructed
the
entrance
and
failed
to
part
like
the
red
sea--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
somebody
wanted
to
go
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
am
reading
the
closing
argument
on
behalf
of
the
clinic
plaintiffs
at
the
trial,
and
it
says,
in
every
issue
we've
shown
you
the
property
rights
of
the
clinics
and
the
women
were
extorted
under
rico.
even
a
few
hours
of
deprivation
of
legal
rights
will
satisfy
the
rico
act
of
extortion.
there
is
one
way,
i
guess,
in
which
you
don't
have
the
element
of
force
in
a
blockade,
and
that
would
be
if
the
blockaders
did
something
that
they
were
specifically
instructed
that
they
should
never
do,
that
is,
politely
move
aside,
part
like
the
red
sea,
and
let
a
woman
through.
but
you
know
that
never
happened.
no
witness
ever
testified
to
that.
no
witness...
not
defense,
not
plaintiff...
ever
said
that
any
of
the
blockaders
were
instructed
to
let
women
through.
in
other
words,
you
told
the
jury
that
you
could
find
an
offense
here
under
the
hobbs
act
by
the
mere
blockade.
it
wasn't
smacking
people
around.
it
was
just
not
letting
people
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're...
you're
changing
your
position
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
is...
it
is
strange
to
think
of
carry
nation,
that
notorious
extortionist.
i
mean,
you
know,
that's
just
not
the
crime
involved.
there...
there's
a
crime
there,
but
is
it
extortion?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
you
coerce
them
to
do
that
is
not
the
giving
up
of
property?
give
me
an
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
want
to
retain
the
labor
union
exception,
however,
i
assume.
