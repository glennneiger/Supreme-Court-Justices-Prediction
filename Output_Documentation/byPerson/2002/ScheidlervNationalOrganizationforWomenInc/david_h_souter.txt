except
that
services
is
not
property,
and
the
one
thing
that
is
common
in
both
the
negative
and
the
positive
examples
is
the
obtaining
of
control.
it's...
it's...
it
seems
to
me
it's...
it's
the
control
that's
important
when
he
says
serve
a,
b,
and
c.
it
isn't
property
that
he
has
obtained.
it's...
it's
an
action.
it's
a
service.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
true
in
each
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i...
i
agree
with
you
on
that
point,
but
i...
i
guess
i'm
saying
that
if
you
concede
in
the
one
case,
i
don't
see
why
you...
you
really
don't
have
to
concede
in...
in
the
other
case
because
the
one
thing
that
is
common
to
each
is
control,
and
there
is
no
property
in
a
tangible
sense
that
is
obtained
in...
in
the
positive
service
examples.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
does
one
obtain?
one
obtains,
in
each
case,
control--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i.e.,
direction.
justice
david
h.
souter
my
point
is
if
you
are
conceding
that
justice
breyer's
positive
examples
would
fall
within
the
statute,
i
don't
see
why
you
don't
have
to
concede
that
the
negative
example,
i.e.,
don't
serve,
doesn't
also
fall--
justice
david
h.
souter
--on...
on
your
own
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
don't
know
why
they--
justice
david
h.
souter
at
the...
on
the
second
round,
when...
when
the
senate
passed
and
the
house
didn't,
there's
no
explanation
in
the
house
record,
is
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would...
it
would
be...
i...
the
trouble
i'm
having
is
i
don't
have
any
trouble
seeing
the
argument
your
way.
the...
the
reason
i'm...
at
this
point,
i'm
not
convinced
is
that
you
do
have
in
subsection
(c)
the
language
referring...
it
says
may.
what
is
it?
may
sue...
i
can't...
yes,
may
sue
therefor.
and
we've
got
the
general
presumption
that
all
appropriate
remedies
go
with
a
cause
of
action.
and
i'm...
i'm
wondering
if
in
a
case
in
which
it's
uncertain
what
to
infer,
either
from
the
legislative
record
in...
on
intent,
or
from
the
textual
record
here,
whether
the
presumption
not
to
carry
the
day
in
a
case
of
doubt--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
it...
may
i
tell
you
the
reason
i
wasn't
convinced
on
that
is
that
if...
if
congress
were...
were
specifying
in
the
text
here
choices
among
ordinary
remedies,
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
strong
argument.
the
reason
it
seems
less
strong
here
is
that
the
choices
that...
or
the...
the
remedies
that
congress
has
specified
are
extraordinary
remedies,
e.g.,
right
in
this
section.
what
is
specified
is
treble
damages,
not
damages.
if
they
had
simply
said
can
get
damages,
i
think
it
would
be
a
slam-dunk,
but...
but
what
they
did
was...
was
to
specify
something
out
of
the
ordinary,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
that
carries
the
implication
that
ordinary
remedies,
consistent
with
what
it
specifies,
are...
are
meant
to
be
excluded.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
just
don't
remember
this.
does...
does
the...
does
clayton
use
the
phrase,
sue
therefor?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
have
to
go
back
and
look.
is
that
the
term
of
art
that's
in
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
i
just...
i
just
didn't
go
back
and
look.
that
is
the
phrase?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
else
could
it
mean?
justice
david
h.
souter
shouldn't
we
draw
the
line
this
way?
instead
of
speaking
as,
for
example,
the
solicitor
general
did
and
some
of
the
cases
do
about
obtaining
control,
isn't
the
way
to...
to
adhere
to
the
line
between
the
liberty
and
property
distinction
to
say
that
you
extort
if
you
gain
control
in
a
way
which
prevents
them
from
doing
business,
i.e.,
engaging
in
a
property
exercise,
but
you
do
not
extort
if
you
gain
control
simply
in
the
way
they
do
business,
i.e.,
their
choice
of
whom
to
serve?
if
we
draw
that
distinction,
then
the
old
sit-ins
in
the
lunch
counter
weren't
there
to
stop
them
from
doing
business.
they
wanted
them
to
do
business.
they
wanted
them
to
do
business
with
them.
whereas,
the
case
which
i
think
you
have
is
a
case
that
could
be
argued
that
the
point
of
it
was
to
stop
the
business,
period,
and
that
gets
into
property
and
crosses
the
line
from
liberty
to
property.
would
you
accept
that
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
wanted
a...
i
mean,
but
they...
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--their
immediate
object
was
to
get
the
sandwich
or
the
coke.
so
that
was
easy.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe...
maybe
it
is,
but
i...
i
think...
among
other
things,
i
think
we
are,
and
should
be
more
concerned
about
the
first
amendment
issues
which
arise
when
you
cross
the
line
into
liberty
than
the...
than
the
cases
were
40
years
ago
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
they
wouldn't...
they
wouldn't
be
if
you
observed
the
distinction
i
was
throwing
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
carry
nation
would
be
covered.
there's
no
question.
the...
the
lunch
counter
sit-ins
would
not,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
not
going
to
get...
you're
not
going
to
get
my--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no
majesty
with
carry
nation.
i
mean,
you
don't
get
my
sympathy
by
saying
you...
you
might
have
interfered
with
carry
nation
on--
