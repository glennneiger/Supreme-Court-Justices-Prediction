i
suppose
in
some
instances
one
competitor
can
buy
another
competitor's
firm
and
just
close
it
up
in
a
regular
business
transaction,
and
that...
that
would
be
obtaining
it
in
that
sense.
now,
of
course,
i
recognize
that
title
transfers,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
here
the
result
is
about
the
same.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
the...
that
the
boycott
or...
or
the
protests
are
sufficient
to
close
it
down.
they
have
obtained
it
in
a
certain
sense
in
that
they
have
obtained...
they
have
secured
for
themselves
the
use
that
they
want
of
it,
i.e.,
no
use.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--just...
just
on
the
obtain
point,
which
i...
i
agree
with
you
is
of
great
relevance
here,
if...
if
a
group
trespasses
on
property
and...
and
remains
there
for
a
period
of
days,
can
it
be
said
that
they're
obtaining
the
use
of
the
property,
or
is...
is
that
too
much
of
a
stretch?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
you
withdraw
in
order
to
avoid
confrontation.
i
suppose
if
a
robs
b,
and
b
turns
over
the
wallet,
in
a
sense
there's
consent,
not...
not
the
kind
of
consent
that
the
law
would
ever
recognize.
it's
a
consent
in
a...
just
from
the
standpoint
that
there's
a
voluntary
act
in
handing
over
the...
the
wallet.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
make
your...
you
make
your
muscles
move
and
that's
about
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
that
definition,
i
suppose
that
anytime
protesters
trespass
on
property,
they've
obtained
the
use
of
that
property
and
there's
a
hobbs
act
violation--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--hobbs
act
predicate
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if...
if
that's...
if
that's
a
strained
reading
of
obtained,
shouldn't
we
be...
take
counsel
of...
that
there's
a...
serious
first
amendment
consequences...
consequence
if
we
adopt
that
extensive
definition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the...
there's
always
a
first
amendment
implication
in
a
protest
case.
there's...
at
this
point
there
is
a
first
amendment
issue
in
the
case
because
of
the
broad
definition
you're
proposing,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
give
the
extraordinary
power
of
ordering
divestiture
and
not
giving
a
party
who
is
irreparably
injured
the
authority
to
go
into
court
and
say,
stop
now...
temporarily--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
have
two...
two
difficult
and
major
arguments
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
would
like
to
hear
your
comments
on
obtaining
property.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
but
still...
still
it
seems
to
me
that
your...
your
theory
doesn't
depend
on
violence.
your
theory
is
that
you're
obtaining...
or
that
the
defendants
here
were
obtaining
property
because
they
prohibited
its
use.
that's
your
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
so...
so
long
as
the
means
were
wrongful,
the
obtaining
definitional
problem
still
remains,
and
i
think
you
should
address
that.
