mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
makes
this
case
distinctive
as
a
first
amendment
case
is
the
presence
of
a
general
law
not
directed
at
speech
at
all
but
directed
at
conduct
that's
under
challenge
and
the
absence
of
any
expressive
activity
whatsoever
by
the
person
seeking
to
raise
the
overbreadth
challenge.
this
court's
cases
have
entertained
overbreadth
challenges
as
a
means
of
alleviating
the
chill
of
first
amendment
rights
of
persons
who
are
not
before
the
court,
but
the
court
has
never
entertained
overbreadth
when
the
consequence
of
doing
so
would
be
to
invalidate
a
general
law
that's
primarily
aimed
at
conduct
and
when
the
person
who's
raising
the
challenge
did
nothing
to
engage
in
speech
or
any
expressive
activity
at
all.
the
costs
of
an
overbreadth
challenge,
this
court
has
recognized,
are
high
because
they
prohibit
the
government
from
enforcing
a
law
against
conduct
that
is
not
constitutionally
protected.
but
those
costs
are
magnified
when
the
law
under
challenge
is
not
merely
a
law
that
directs--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
not
sure
that
this
court
would,
justice
stevens.
it
would
then
be
in
a
posture
more
analogous
to
the
j.h.
munson
case
that
was
before
the
court
in
which
the
court
considered
and
your
honor's
separate
opinion
addressed
the
question
of
whether,
when
there
was
an
independent
state
overbreadth
analysis,
could
an
aggrieved
state
official
then
bring
the
case
to
this
court.
what
is
clear
on
the
current
record
is
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
cited
and
relied
on--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
question
there
would
be
whether
the
state
was
sufficiently
aggrieved
so
as
to
have
standing
under
the
principles
announced--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
most
relevant
case
is
probably
the
asarco
decision
in
which
the
court
concluded
that
once
the
state
court
binds
the
state
officials
to
a
particular
ruling,
that
there
may
be
the
requisite
case
or
controversy
to
allow
this
court
to
decide--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
it
has
two
aspects,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
aspect
of
it
does
relate
to
whether
there
is
a
case
or
controversy,
and
there
clearly
has
to
be
a
developed
enough
case
or
controversy
to
allow
article
iii
to
be
invoked
for
this
court
to
announce
first
amendment
principles
at
all.
and
part
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine
responds
to
those
concerns.
but
another
aspect
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine
is
purely
prudential,
and
this
court
has
adopted
those
limits
as
a
matter
of...
of
prudential
principles
to
avoid
the
premature
adjudication
of
hypothetical
and
abstract
first
amendment
questions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
i
wouldn't
dispute--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
overbreadth
is...
is
an
application
of
a
more
general
principle
that
this
court
has
adopted
on...
in
various
circumstances
to
allow
a
party
who's
before
the
court
and
who
is
aggrieved
to
raise
the
rights
of
others.
for
example,
in
batson
challenges,
the
court
allows
criminal
defendants
to
raise
the
rights
of
the
excluded
jurors.
this
is
an
example
of
third
party
standing
designed
to
implement
first
amendment
norms,
but
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
costs
of
invalidating
a
law,
when
the
person
before
the
court
doesn't
have
constitutionally
protected
conduct,
are
high,
and
those
costs
are
higher
when
what's
being
invalidated
is
not
merely
a
law
aimed
at
speech,
but
a
law
aimed
at
access,
general
conduct,
as
is
this
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
probably
true
unless
the
court
applies
the
asarco
principle
to
allow
an
aggrieved
state
official
to
bring
the
case
here
because
its
own
supreme
court
has
interfered
with
the
implementation
of
federal
law--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
the
answer
to
this
paradox
is
that
the
state
court
can
adopt
much
broader
principles
of
law
with
respect
to
standing
than
this
court
would
impose,
and
it
can
administer
them
even
when
it's
adjudicating
federal
light...
rights.
for
example,
a
state
could
allow
a
purely
advisory
opinion
to
be
issued
by
its
state
supreme
court
challenging
this
law
by
any
citizen.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
true.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that...
that
is
an
adjudication
of
the...
of
the
overbreadth
challenge
on
the
merits.
it
would
be
a
determination
that
there
is
not
sufficient
real
and
substantial
overbreadth
to
invalidate
this
law,
and
we
do
think
that
that
is
a
correct
analysis
and
would
suffice
to
reject
the
virginia
supreme
court's
holding
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
not
exactly
right,
justice
souter,
because
i
think
this
is
an
area
analogous
to
the
court's
rules
in
criminal
cases
under
michigan
v.
long
where
the
court
has
to
decide,
does
this
opinion
rest
on
a
question
of
federal
law
or
does
it
rest
on
a
question
of
state
law?
and
in
michigan
v.
long,
the
court
adopted
a
presumption
that
if
what
a
state
court
does
is
cite
and
rely
on
federal
precedents,
we
will
presume
that
it
did
what
it
did
because
it
thought
it
was
compelled
to
by
the
force
of
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
it
would
only
be
a
modest
extension
because
in
this
case
the
court
did
not
separately
analyze
the
questions
of
standing
as
such
from
whether
respondent
could
bring
an
overbreadth
challenge,
and
the
question
wasn't
posed
with
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it...
what
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--let
me...
let
me
explain
it
this
way,
justice
souter.
if
this
court
said
the
first
amendment
overbreadth
doctrine
requires
that
state
courts
entertain
overbreadth
claims
like
this
one
even
when
it's
a
general
law
and
even
when
the
party
before
the
court
has
been
convicted
of
conduct
that
doesn't
involve
speech,
then
state
courts
would
be
required
to
follow
that
rule
and
could
not
adopt
a
different
standing
principle
that
was
narrower
and
that
would
exclude
respondent.
and
our
reading
of
the
virginia
supreme
court's
opinion
is
that
virginia
either
thought
or
assumed
that
it
was
required
by
this
court's
cases
to
entertain
an
overbreadth
challenge.
the
proper
response,
if
the
court
agrees
that
it's
not
the
state
court's
obligation
to
entertain
this
overbreadth
challenge,
would
be
to
vacate
the
judgment,
announce
the
correct
first
amendment
principles,
and
remand
the
case
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
for
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
this
case,
it
certainly
would
because
the
state
court
hasn't
relied
on
a
clearly
insufficient
case
or
controversy
in
order
to
adjudicate
federal
rights.
there
is,
in
fact,
a
case
or
controversy
here.
the
respondent
has
been
convicted
of
a
criminal
offense,
and
he
is
challenging
the
law
under
which
he
was
convicted.
so
this
case
does
not
fall
outside
of
the
case
or
controversy
requirement
even
measured
by
article
iii
standards.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that...
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
thank
you.
