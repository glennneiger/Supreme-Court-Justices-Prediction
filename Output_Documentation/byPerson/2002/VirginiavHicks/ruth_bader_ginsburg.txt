but
if
we
were
to
hold
for
you
on
that
ground,
the
virginia
supreme
court
would
be
free
to
say
on
remand,
would
it
not,
that
it
has
decided
to
take
a
more
generous
view
of
standing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hurd--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hurd,
that's
a
curiosity
about
this
case,
the
fact
background
of
it
that
perhaps
you
can
clarify.
you
keep
saying
legitimate
visitor.
this
man's
mother
and
his
child
and
the
mother
of
his
child
all
live
in
this
project,
and
one
would
think
that
he
would
certainly
have
a
basis
to
visit
his
family.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
we
don't
know
why.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
disputed
that
his...
that
they
live
in
the
project.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
follow
that
course,
we
wouldn't
get
to
the
substantive
overbreadth,
right?
we
would
just--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
have
some
original
alleys
in
the
district
that
are
comparable
i
think.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
dealt
with
only
one.
mr.
hurd
said,
yes,
your
question
of
public
forum
or
not
would
be
open,
your
due
process
vagueness
argument
would
be
open.
what
wouldn't
be
open,
if
we
ruled
against
you
on
this
first
amendment
overbreadth
thing,
is...
that's
all.
everything
else...
the
virginia
supreme
court
said
this
is
what
we're
deciding
and
we're
not
getting
to...
they
deliberately
said
we're
not
getting
to
public
forum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
just
stop
you
there
as
a
matter
of
accuracy?
we
don't
know
why
he
was
debarred,
but
we
do
know
that
one
of
the
charges
was
destruction
of
property.
we
don't
know
what
property
that
was.
so
it's...
i
think
you're
painting
a
somewhat
false
picture
to
suggest
that
this
was
a
loving
father
who
was
simply
going
to
visit
his
children.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
you
just
said
goes
right
to
vagueness,
that
you
have
an
administrator
who
says,
i'm
queen.
i'll
let
you
in
or
i
won't
let
you
in.
i
don't
see
why
you
need
the
first
amendment
hook
to
challenge
that
point.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
benjamin,
it
may
not
be
immediately
before
us,
but
it
seems
to
me
it
is
the
heart
of
your
case.
you
are
essentially
saying
that
a
public
authority
cannot
create,
for
people
who
live
in
projects,
a
gated
community.
the
people
who
live
outside
projects
can
have
streets,
everything
just
like
this,
but
government
can't
create
it
for
poor
people.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
it
did,
and
one
of
them
was
a
gang
member.
