justice
david
h.
souter
but
when
we're
not
talking
about
substantive
law,
why
is
that
really
an...
an
issue
for
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
can
do
what
they
want.
it's
their
courts.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
they
didn't
say
that
here.
i
mean,
they
didn't
say
the
supreme
court
requires
this
and
our
standing
doctrine
would
be
narrower,
but
we
feel
we
must.
i
mean,
we...
we
just
don't
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they...
they
did
with
respect
to...
to
substantive
law...
the
substantive
doctrine
overbreadth.
but
at
no
point
did
they
say,
we
would
not
entertain
this
matter
if
it
were
brought
under
state
law,
but
we
are
required
to
do
so
by
the
supreme
court's
substantive
doctrine.
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
hurd,
could
we
go
back
just
to
justice
stevens'
question
for
a
minute?
and
i...
i
just
want
to...
i
want
you
to
comment
on
the
significance
of
the...
of
the...
the
notice
that
you
set
out
on
page
5
of
your
brief.
the
notice
says:
no
trespassing,
private
property,
you
are
now
entering
private
property
and
streets,
et
cetera.
that
sounds
to
me
as
though
it...
it
means,
as...
as
a
no
trespassing
sign
normally
would,
that
if
you
are
not
a...
the
landowner
or
a
licensee
of
the
landowner
specifically,
you're
not
supposed
to
enter.
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
unauthorized
persons,
which
i
take
it
anybody
who
is
not
authorized
to
enter,
will
be
subject
to
arrest
and
prosecution.
so
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question,
if...
if
that
notice,
which
is
posted
all
over
the...
the
area,
is
a
statement
of
policy,
i
assume
it
is
excluding
everybody--
justice
david
h.
souter
--who
is
not
a
resident.
and...
and
it
then
goes
on
to
say
that
following
some
review
for
what
may
or
may
not
be
authority,
people
coming
in
can
be
arrested
and
prosecuted.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
is
that
what
this
says?
if
we...
if
we
stick
simply
to
the
notices
that
you've
put
up,
isn't
that,
in
effect,
the
burden
of
the
notices
that
you've
put
up?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
before
we
get
to
that,
it
says,
no
trespassing.
and
doesn't
that
normally
mean
that
if
you
are
not
the
landowner
or
a
licensee,
you're
trespassing?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
are
you
taking
the
position
that
the
policy
and
the
signs
are
different
in
their
content?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
read
them
separately,
are
they
different?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
does--
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
you're...
i
think
you're
saying
that...
that
under
asarco,
they
can
challenge
the
substantiality
point,
but
they
wouldn't
necessarily
be
able
to
challenge
the
standing
point
which
gets
this
particular
defendant
in
a
position
to
raise
the
issue
in
the
first
place.
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
certainly...
that
certainly
applies
when
you're
talking
about
substantive
law
whether
it...
it
would
be
an
extension
of
that
to
apply
it
to
standing.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
isn't
that
a
question
of
standing
by
definition?
justice
david
h.
souter
overbreadth
is
an
exception
to
standing,
and...
and
so
why
is
it
anything
but
a
standing
issue?
substantiality
of
overbreadth
is...
is
a
substantive
issue,
but...
you
see
my--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
that
would...
that
would
basically
be
applying
something
like
michigan
v.
long
rather
than
asarco,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
mr.
benjamin,
i'm
going
to
ask
you
to
assume
that
i
at
least
do
not
accept
the
view
that
the
record
shows
that
your
client
was
there
for
an
expressive
purpose
that
ought
to
be
recognized
by
the...
by
the
first
amendment.
i
don't
ask
you
to
stipulate
that
he
was
banned
because
he
was
a
criminal.
i
will
simply
assume
that
he
is
in
some
middle
ground,
that
he
is
not
there
for
expressive
purposes.
assume
we
don't
know
why
he's
there.
what's
your...
your
answer
basically
to
the
question
put
to
you
by
justice
breyer?
why
is
it
necessary,
in
order
to
protect
the
first
amendment,
to
allow
a
person
in
that
position
to...
to
raise
this
kind
of...
of
issue
with
respect,
say,
to
leafleters
or
people
who
are
there
for
expressive
purposes?
why
do
we
need
to
recognize
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
changing
my
hypo.
i
mean,
i...
i
said
let's
assume
that
we
don't
have
a
predicate
for
saying
this
person's
conduct
is
expressive.
i
will
grant
you
that
there
are
always
going
to
be
points
on
the
margin
in
which
we
say,
well,
was
he
there
for
speech
or
wasn't
he.
assume
he
wasn't.
what...
what
is
the...
what
is
the
best
argument
for
recognizing
his
right
to
raise
a
first
amendment
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
don't
you
have
an
adequate
basis
to
deal
with
them
under
the
vagueness
doctrine,
for
example,
that
is
open
to
you
on
remand,
even
if
you
lose
here?
why
do
we
have
to
turn
this
into
a
first
amendment
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
it
true...
but
isn't
the
problem
with
your
argument
this:
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
a
statute
that
ostensibly
addresses
speech
is
likely
to
have
a
serious
overbreadth
problem
if
it
is
very
vague
in
the
way
it
does
it,
but
it
is
a
very
different
thing
to
say
that
a
statute
that
does
not
ostensibly
address
speech,
that
addresses
conduct,
walking
across
a
line,
becomes
an
overbreadth...
presents
an
overbreadth
problem
simply
because
somebody
who
crosses
that
line
might
want
to
talk.
and
you're
arguing
on
the
basis
of
cases
in
the
first
category,
speech
with
vague
limitations,
to
tell
us
that
we
ought
to...
that
we
ought
to
consider
everything
in
the
second
category
a
speech
case.
isn't
that
the...
the
difficulty
of
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
if
you're
right
on
that,
we
don't
have
to
get
to
the
speech
issue.
if
you're
wrong
on
that,
you
have
the
problem
that
i
just
presented
to
you,
don't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
if...
look,
if...
if
you're
right
that
the
government
cannot,
in
their
words,
privatize
the
streets,
then
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
your
guy
can't
be
prosecuted
for
trespass
in
this
instance,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
issue
here.
if
it
turns
out,
on
the
other
hand,
that
the
government
can
indeed
do
what
it
purported
to
do
here,
then
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
suffers
from
the
problem
that
i
raised.
you're
saying
that
even
in
a
case
in
which
the
statute
doesn't
address
speech
but
addresses
conduct,
crossing
a
property
line,
there
is
a
speech
implication
and
every
one
of
those
trespass
cases
becomes
a
first
amendment
overbreadth
case.
isn't...
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
when
it
gets
very,
very,
very,
very,
very
vague
that's
when
it
becomes
a...
a
first
amendment
problem
even
though
it...
the
statute
doesn't
address
speech.
is
that
basically
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
could
we
administer
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we...
do
we
have
any...
any
overbreadth
cases
that...
that
would
support
that?
i
mean,
our
overbreadth
cases
start
with...
with
a
speech
claim
and
says,
well,
maybe
you
can
stop
my
speech,
but
you
can't
stop
his.
do...
do
you
have
any
authority
for--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
thought
they
wanted
to
have
a
parade
or
a...
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
--an
assembly
of
some
sort.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh.
