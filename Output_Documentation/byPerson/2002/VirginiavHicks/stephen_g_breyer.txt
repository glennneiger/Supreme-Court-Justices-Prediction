justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
sure
why
we...
why
it's
called
standing.
that's
where
i'm
basically
mixed
up
in
this
case.
the
person
has
nothing
to
do
with
speech,
the
particular
defendant.
it's
sort
of
like
a
person
who
has
a
gun
under
a
gun
statute
that
forbids
it.
and
he
wants
to
say
that
this
law
is
unconstitutional
because
it
might
apply
to
people
who
were
petitioning,
and
if
it
did,
it
wouldn't
do
it
right.
it
might
apply
to
people
who
were
speaking.
it
might
apply
to
speech,
just
as
the
gun
law
might
apply
to
people
who
have
a
gun
in
a
theater
in
a
part
of
a
play.
and
he
wants
to
say
that
this
law
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
him
because
of
that
problem
with
it.
and
in
the
gun
case,
it
would
be
apparent
that
the
law
wouldn't
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
him
because
in
most
of
its
applications,
it
would
be
constitutional
and
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
speech.
and
now
you
want
to
say,
that's
true
here,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
aren't
you
and
he
arguing
on
the
merits
of
a
constitutional
matter,
whether
this
statute
is
or
is
not
unconstitutional
because
of
the
possibility
that
it
could
be
badly
applied
in
a
free
speech
area
that
isn't
this
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
that
the
merits?
why
is
it
standing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
but
that's...
that's
the
problem.
i
mean,
this
is
exactly...
that's
why
i'm
mixed
up
about
the
standing
part
versus
the
merits.
it
seems
to
me
if
it's
a
traditional
question
of
standing,
there...
there
are
a
group
of
people
who
are
trespassing
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
speech.
and
then
there's
some
other
hypothetical
people
that
might
have
to
do
with
speech.
and
the
question
is
can
these
people
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
speech
invalidate
the
statute
because
of
the
way
it
applies
to
some
other
people?
now,
in
the
first
amendment
area,
we
have
normally
let
people
do
that,
but
in
other
areas
not.
all
right.
so
suppose
the
answer
is
not.
you
can't.
that's
their
problem.
let
them
raise
it.
now,
virginia
says,
we
want
to
let
any
taxpayer
raise
it.
if
it
were
purely
standing,
any
taxpayer
could
raise
it,
but
then
what?
i
would
have
said
that
the
first
holding
would
have
meant
it
is
not
unconstitutional
under
the
federal
constitution
to
convict
this
person.
and...
and
now,
under...
under
the
guise
of
standing,
they're
going
to
come
back
and
say,
oh,
no,
it
is
unconstitutional
because
we
let
this
person
raise
the
rights
of
some
others.
that's
where
i'm
confused.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
fine,
let
them
challenge
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
if
you're
right,
no
matter
how
much
they
challenge
it,
the
simple
fact
is,
if
you're
right,
it
doesn't
violate
the
federal
constitution
to
convict
this
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
raising
it
going
to
get
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
streets
in
cambridge
which
are
called
private
ways,
and
nobody
knows
what
that
means.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
the
answer
then
to
the
overbreadth
question?
that
is,
the
first
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
which
we
granted,
asks,
as
i
read
it,
the
question
of
whether
a
person
who
does
not
engage
in
expressive
conduct
at
all
can
ask
the
court
and
can
succeed
in
having
the
court
strike
down
a
statute
as
applied
to
him
for
the
reason
that
it
might
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
other
people
engaged
in
expressive
conduct.
the
example
would
be,
favoring
their
side,
that
you
have
a
gun
statute.
any
person
who
possesses
a
gun
is...
goes
to
jail,
and
the
defendant
says,
well,
i
did
possess
a
gun
and
i
was
trying
to
rob
a
bank,
but
maybe
this
statute
would
be
applied
to
a
person
in
a
play,
in
which
case
it
would
be
too
broad.
and
they
say
it's
like
that
absurd
example.
all
right.
now,
why
isn't
it
close
enough
to
the
absurd
example?
they're
also
arguing
that
this
is
a
statute
that
deals
with
drugs.
it
deals
with
ordinary
trespass.
very
few
of
these
people
want
to
pamphlet
or
engage
in
expressive
conduct.
a
handful
might,
but
if
they
do,
let's
consider
it,
when
this
statute
is
applied
to
them,
which
it
never
has
been
in
their
view.
now,
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
happened
to
be...
i
didn't
give
you
the
whole
statute.
there
were
seven
other
constitutional
errors
in
it,
but
i
didn't
mention
them
because
they
could
be
raised
on
remand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's...
that...
that
i'm
trying
to
make
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
is
there
a...
is
there
a
risk
here?
and
i'm
not
asking
it
from
one
point
of
view
or
another.
i
don't
know.
but
if
we
accepted
that,
there
are
trespass
laws
all
over
the
country.
and...
and
would...
i
don't
know
what
they
all
say,
but
people
who
are
convicted
of
ordinary
trespass...
and
a
lot
of
them
apply
to
public
property,
et
cetera...
could
then
come
in
and
say,
look,
these
trespass
laws,
even
though
they've
never
been
applied
to
stop
expression...
except
in
my
case,
but
i'm
assuming
it's
not
expression
in
my
case.
assume
it's
not.
we
have
to
set
them
all
aside
because
they
might
be
applied
to
expression
in...
in
a
way
that's
unconstitutional.
if
i
accepted
the
proposition
that
you've
just
accepted,
have
i
got
myself
in
that
box?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
other
words,
if
i
take
the
proposition
you've
just
accepted
as
your
argument,
am
i
then
allowing
people
who
trespass...
nothing
to
do
with
expression...
to
start
attacking
all
the
trespass
laws
on
the
ground
that
if
applied
in
the
expression
area,
they
would
be
unconstitutional?
and
they
haven't
been
applied
in
that
area.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words...
i
would
be--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
would
be
accepting
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
trespass
on
public
property...
there
could
be
all
kinds
of
situations,
federal
buildings
and
dozens
of
them,
where
in
fact
it's
really
applied
against
people
who
are
breaking
in
who
have
no
business
there,
and
they
just
don't
apply
it
or
it
never
has
come
up
whether
they
would
apply
it
were
somebody
interested
in
a
demonstration.
