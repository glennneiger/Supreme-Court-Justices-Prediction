justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
cite
our
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hurd,
that's
not
the
issue
anyway,
is
it,
whether
they
would
have
had
a
narrower
interpretation
under
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
is
whether...
whether
they
adopted
a
broader
interpretation
under
state
law
than
federal
law
would
require.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
the
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
indication
that
they
were
adopting
a
broader
interpretation
than
federal
law
requires.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
they
were
correct
about
what
our
standing
rules
are,
they
would
have
to
follow
those
standing
rules,
wouldn't
they?
they
could
not
apply
a
narrower--
justice
antonin
scalia
--basis
for
standing,
could
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hurd,
we
don't
normally
decide
whether
a
statute
is
constitutional
in
the
abstract,
do
we?
i
thought
we
normally
decided
whether
someone
has
been
unconstitutionally
convicted.
we
don't
go
around
bashing
statutes
in
their
totality.
we
say
this
person
was
unconstitutionally
convicted.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
why
it's...
it's
a
question
of
third-party
standing
whether
you
can
say
i
was
unconstitutionally
convicted
because
if
you
applied
this
statute
to
somebody
else,
he
would
be
unconstitutionally
convicted.
justice
antonin
scalia
which,
as
far
as
the
text
of
the
ordinance
is
concerned,
legitimate
business
could
include
pamphleting.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
far
as
the
text
is
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
wasn't
the
interpretation
by
one
of
the
administrators
that
leafleting
was
not
ipso
facto
legitimate
businessing,
or
pamphleting
or
whatever.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
an
addendum.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
the
signs
that
are
under
challenge
here,
or
is
it
the
ordinance?
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
may
well
be
that
the
ordinance
is
constitutional
but
the
signs
aren't.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
possible.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
they
want
him
out
too.
we
don't
really
know
that
either,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
same
party
can
have
standing
to
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
clearly
relates
to
the
doctrine
of
standing,
doesn't
it,
which
doctrine
says
that
you
normally
do
not
have
standing
to
raise
the
objections
of
other
people?
you
only
have
standing
to
raise
objections
to
your
own
treatment,
not
to
the
treatment
of
others,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
overbreadth
changes
that.
it
says
in
this
one
area,
you
can
object
to
the
treatment
of
other
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
wasn't
a
law
making
those
private
sidewalks.
what...
what
about
the
streets
to
and
from
the
entry
to
the
governor's
mansion
in
richmond?
are
they
public
streets
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
exclude
the
public
from...
from
marching
right
up
to
the
governor's
front
door?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
gate.
from
the
gate,
but
there's
a
street
that
goes
right
from
the
gate
right
up,
you
know,
circular
driveway,
right
up
to
the
governor's
front
door.
that's
a
public
street.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
it's
not
a
public
street.
justice
antonin
scalia
--so...
so
there
can
be
streets
owned
by
the
state
of
virginia
or
the
city
of
richmond
that
are
not
public
streets.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
only
issue
is
whether
this
is
one
of
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
residents
of
this
housing
project
would
call
these
streets
their...
their
driveways,
the...
the
access
to
their
particular
apartments.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
lot
of
stuff
in
cambridge
that
nobody
understands.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
have
to
argue
it
if
they
decide
it.
we...
we
will
review
a
question
that
is
either
argued
or
decided
by
the
state
court.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
decided
the
standing
question,
decided
the
overbreadth
question,
and
you're
saying
that
we
cannot
review
that
decision
because
he
was
not
the
one
that
initiated
the...
the
matter?
that's
just
not
what
our
law
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
had
a
whole
long
discussion
of
overbreadth.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
do
you
think
that
was
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
didn't
decide
that
overbreadth
was
an
issue.
they
just
went
ahead
and
decided
if
overbreadth
had
been
an
issue,
this
is
how
the
issue
would
be
resolved.
certainly
they
decided
that
overbreadth...
that
is,
the
standing
doctrine
of
overbreadth...
was
applicable
to
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why
did
they
go
into
the
discussion
of
whether
this
was
overbroad?
they
must
have
thought
it
relevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you're
going
appeal
to
page
60,
you're
just
out
of
the
frying
pan
into
the...
into
the
fire.
yes,
it...
it
doesn't
mention
destruction
of
property,
but
it
does
mention
domestic
violence.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
she's
answering
the
question,
please
tell
the
court
how
he
came...
how
has
he
come
and
have
you
banned
him
from
the
property.
yes.
all
right.
please
tell
the
court
how
that
came
about.
and
she
said,
number
one...
she
gave
two
reasons.
when
the
police
see
a
person
in
the
development
and
they
say
they
live
someplace,
they
confirm
with
the
office,
and
kevin
hicks
gave
a
false
address.
secondly,
because
of
the
domestic
violence
in
the
development.
i...
i
take
that
to
be
a
response
to
the
question
that
was
asked.
so,
you
know,
to
the
extent
we
know
anything
about
why
he
was
banned,
it
was
either
because
he
destroyed
property
or
because
he
participated
in
domestic
violence.
justice
antonin
scalia
those
are
all
vagueness...
those
are
all
vagueness
points.
they...
they
really
don't
go
to
the...
right?
you're
making
the
vagueness
argument
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
would
have
us
rule
on
a
vagueness
ground
as
well,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
sort
of
like
to
separate
the
arguments
that
are
going
to
vagueness
and
those
that
are
going
to
overbreadth.
the
ones
you're
making
now
don't
go
to
overbreadth,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
think
that
was
a
first
amendment.
what
about
morales?
what...
what
did
morales
involve?
justice
antonin
scalia
street
corner
assembly.
justice
antonin
scalia
their...
their
right
to
gather
and
assemble.
i...
that's
sort
of
first
amendment
stuff,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
the
thing
that
the
person
wanted
to
do
was
to...
was
to
gather
with
his
buddies
on
the
street
corner.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
the
richmond
redevelopment
and
housing
authority,
which
i
will
refer
to
as
rrha,
is
a
political
subdivision
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
it
owns
and
operates
whitcomb
court,
a
low-income
housing
development.
in
1997,
the
richmond
city
council
conveyed
whitcomb
court's
streets
to
the
rrha
in
an
effort
to
combat
crime
and
drug
dealing
by
nonresidents.
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
conveyance,
the
rrha
enacted
a
policy
authorizing
the
richmond
police
to
serve
a
trespass
notice
on
any
person
who
is
on
the
premises
without
a
"legitimate
business
or
social
purpose",
and
to
arrest
for
trespassing
any
person
who
after
receiving
that
notice
remains
or
later
returns.
the
rrha
gave
respondent,
hicks,
a
nonresident,
written
notice
barring
him
from
whitcomb
court.
subsequently,
he
trespassed
there
and
was
arrested
and
convicted.
at
trial,
he
claimed
among
other
things
that
the
rrha's
policy
was
unconstitutionally
overbroad.
the
virginia
court
of
appeals
vacated
his
conviction.
in
affirming,
the
virginia
supreme
court
found
the
policy
unconstitutionally
overbroad
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
because
an
unwritten
rule
that
leafletting
and
demonstrating
requires
advanced
permission
from
the
manager
of
whitcomb
court,
vested
too
much
discretion
in
that
manager.
we
conclude
that
the
rrha's
trespass
policy
is
not
facially
invalid
under
the
first
amendment's
overbreadth
doctrine
and
we
therefore
reverse.
under
the
overbreadth
doctrine,
a
showing
that
a
law
punishes
a
substantial
amount
of
protected
free
speech
in
relation
to
its
plainly
legitimate
sweep,
that
is
quote
from
our
cases,
suffices
to
invalidate
all
enforcement
of
that
law
unless
and
until
a
limiting
construction
or
partial
invalidation
so
narrows
the
law
as
to
remove
the
seeming
threat
or
deterrence
to
constitutionally
protected
expression.
only
substantial
overbreadth
supports
such
facial
invalidation
since
there
are
significant
social
costs
in
blocking
a
law's
application
to
constitutionally
unprotected
conducted.
even
assuming
the
invalidity
of
the
unwritten
rule
here
for
leafletters
and
demonstrators,
hicks
has
not
shown
that
the
rrha
policy
prohibits
a
substantial
amount
of
protected
speech
in
relation
to
its
many
legitimate
applications.
both
the
notice-barment
rule
and
the
'legitimate
business
or
social
purpose'
rule
apply
to
all
persons
entering
whitcomb
court
streets,
not
just
to
those
who
seek
to
engage
in
expression."
neither
the
basis
for
the
barment
sanction
namely
a
prior
trespass,
nor
the
purpose
of
a
barment
sanction
preventing
future
trespassers
implicates
the
first
amendment.
an
overbreadth
challenge
rarely
succeeds
against
a
law
or
regulation
such
as
this
which
is
not
specifically
addressed
to
speech
or
to
conduct
necessarily
associated
with
speech.
any
applications
of
the
rrha's
policy
that
violate
the
first
amendment
can
be
remedied
through
case
by
case
as
applied
litigation
rather
than
by
invalidating
the
entire
law
whenever
and
whereever
it
is
applied.
we
leave
open
on
remand
an
issue
raised
by
hicks
but
not
addressed
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
namely
whethere
the
provisions
of
the
rrha
trespass
policy
are
unconstitutionally
vague.
the
court's
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
joined
by
justice
breyer.
