m.

suppose...
and
suppose
i...
the...
the
court
were
to
agree
with
you
that
the
speech
analysis,
particularly
the
overbreadth
analysis
here,
was
wrong.
does
the
case
then
go
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
in
a
posture
where
mr.
hicks
has
the
opportunity
to
challenge
the
ordinance
as
being
unconstitutional
for
other
reasons
apart
from
the
first
amendment?
it's
vague.
it
inhibits
his
right
of...
of
movement.
these
are
streets
that
are
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
public,
whatever.
does
he
have
all
of
those
issues
preserved
to
him
on
remand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
the
context
of
that,
to
say
that
the
ordinance
is
vague
for
other
reasons.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
some
of
our
loyalty
oath
cases...
i
forget
if
it
was
adler
or
doremus.
doremus
was
first
amendment...
allowed
us
to
relax
our
standing
rules
in
order
to
reach
a
substantive
constitutional
issue
cited
by
the
state
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
take...
i
take
it
there
are
any
number
of...
of
difficult
and
important
issues
here.
one
is
the
character
of
these
streets.
we
don't
know
very
much
about
it
in
the
record.
the
other
is
whether,
even
if
they
are
streets
with
some
special
status,
whether
ms.
rogers
is
the
one
who
has
the
right
to
say
who
can
come
and
who
can
go.
this
is
ms.
rogers'
neighborhood
in
a
very
interesting
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i...
i
take
it
that
all
of
those
issues
are
open
for
you
to
argue
if
we
were
to
agree
with
the
state
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
was
simply
wrong
in
its
first
amendment
analysis
on
overbreadth,
and
you
would
have
all
of
those
arguments
to
confront
and
to
see
if
you
can
prevail
on
if
we
remand
it
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
know,
i...
i
think
it's
a
mistake
to
put
too
much
onto
the
first
amendment.
the
police
officer
stops
me
unlawfully
and
i
say,
i
was
on
the
way
home
to
talk
to
my
wife.
i
mean,
this...
this...
it
tends
to
trivialize
the
first
amendment
if
you
put
so
much
on
it.
you
have
some
very
important
substantive
issues
here
about
the
right
of
freedom
of
movement
to
use
the
streets
and
so
forth,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
for
the...
for
you
to
rest
the
case,
a,
on
the
first
amendment,
b,
under
what
is
a
very
questionable
application
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine.
it...
it
is
not
the
right
way
to
proceed
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
maybe
it's
not
your
fault,
but
that's
what
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
said,
and
in
the
course
of
doing
so,
it
arguably...
and
there's
a
very
serious
concern
that
it
misapplied
thornhill.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's...
let's
assume
that
we're
up
to
the
challenge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
some
very
important
vagueness
arguments
in...
in
the...
in
the
classical
sense
of
that
term
that
your
client
can
and
should
make,
and
they're
unrelated
to
the
speech
point.
they're
completely
unrelated
to
it.
they
can
play
back
in
the
speech
context
just
as
well,
but...
but
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
thought
about
this
just
in
the
speech
context,
and
that's
our
concern.
