if
they...
if
they
were
wrong
in
interpreting
our
cases,
they
still
could
have
done
exactly
that
they
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
say
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
we
sent
it
back
and
then
they
said
so,
then
we'd
have
to
take
the
case
and
decide
whether
they're
right
or
wrong
on
the
merits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
think
it
was
limited
to
those
people.
i
thought
it
was
a
total
ban
on
people
coming
in
without
permission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
does
the
policy
ban?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
just
ban
drug
dealers,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i...
let's
say
it's
legitimate
to
keep
all
the
drug
dealers
and
all
the
armed
robbers
out,
but...
but
how
many
other
people
does
it
keep
out?
that's
what
i
was
curious
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
the
no
trespassing
sign
apply
to
everybody?
it
doesn't
just
apply
to
ne'er-do-wells,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben,
assume...
i
know
it's
not
quite
clear,
but
assume
for
the
moment
that
virginia
had
clearly...
virginia
supreme
court
clearly
said
we're
going
to
allow
standing
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
but...
even
though
it
wouldn't
be
allowed
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
and
the
case
then
came
to
us
in
that
posture.
would
we
then
have
authority
to
decide
the
overbreadth
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
just...
i'm
just
wondering
if
it
went
back
and
they
said,
well,
that's
true,
but
it
was
a
matter
of
virginia
law.
we
think
we'll
entertain
a
stand,
and
then
they
decide
on
federal
grounds
that
it
violates
the
first
amendment.
then
my
question
is,
could
we
review
that
holding,
and
if...
if
we
reviewed
it
in
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
irony
of
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
virginia...
virginia
supreme
court
might
undertake
that
cost,
invalidate
a
virginia
statute
on
federal
grounds
that
we
think
are
wrong
and
we
couldn't
do
anything
about
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
benjamin,
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
your
mouth...
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't...
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
your
mouth,
but
is
this
what
you're
trying
to
say,
that
if
the
statute
is
so
overbroad
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
the
person
has
standing
to
challenge
it?
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he
is...
his
disability
is...
is
because
it's
not
a
first
amendment
issue
at
all
or
whether
he's
engaged
in
first
amendment
conduct
which
is
perfectly
prohibitable
as
to
him.
in
either
event,
it
doesn't
matter
why
he
can't
challenge
it
as
long
as
his...
as
the
statute
itself
is
overbroad.
is
that
what
your
position
is?
