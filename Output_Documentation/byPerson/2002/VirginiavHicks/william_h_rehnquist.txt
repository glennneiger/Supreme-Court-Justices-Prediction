chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
02-371,
virginia
v.
kevin
lamont
hicks.
mr.
hurd.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's...
there's
no--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--there's
no
citation
of
any
virginia
case
in
the
opinion,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
applies
to...
it
does
not
apply
to
someone
who
is
coming
to
see
someone
in
the
housing
development,
as
i
understand
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if...
if
we
agree--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hurd.
and
you
wish
to
reserve
the
rest
of
your
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's...
there's
also--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
also
a
question,
isn't
there,
mr.
dreeben,
of
whether
this
overbreadth
doctrine
is
essentially
a
part
of
the
first
amendment
or
a
part
of
the
standing
doctrine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
benjamin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
these
streets
were
still
as
if
they
belonged
to
the
city
of
richmond
after
they
were
deeded
to
the
housing
authority?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why...
you
know,
clearly
the
city
intended
that
they
no
longer
be
public
streets.
why
did
that
intention
fail?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
benjamin,
certainly
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
talked
about
overbreadth.
i
mean,
the...
the
one...
i'm
just
reading
a
sentence
here
from
appendix
page:
thus,
i
conclude
that
the
defendant
may
only
challenge
the
trespass
policy
as
it
was
applied
to
him.
now,
that...
that
is
overbreadth.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
the
supreme
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
our
cases
have
certainly
separated
vagueness
from
overbreadth.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
benjamin.
mr.
hurd,
your
time
is
expiring
even
as
we
speak.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-371,
virginia
against
hicks
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
