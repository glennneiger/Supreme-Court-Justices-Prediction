mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1997,
richmond
took
a
neighborhood
and
by
ordinance,
deed,
and
a
police
authorization,
made
it
so
that
a
person
could
not
walk
down
the
street
or
the
sidewalk
unless
he
could
prove
to
the
police
that
he
was
authorized
to
do
so.
the
policy
that
the
city
implemented
was
of
such
breadth
that
it
included
the
public,
residents
and
nonresidents
alike
of
this
community,
that
it
included
innocent
people
doing
lawful
things,
and
it
included
protected
conduct,
such
as
the
distribution
of
literature.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
they
were
still
public.
they
were
still
public
streets,
regardless
of
the
transfer--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--your
honor,
for
the
same
reason
when
congress
ruled...
or...
or
passed
a
law
saying
that
the
sidewalks
around
this
building
were
no
longer
to
be
used,
for
the
same
reason.
the
intent
didn't
matter.
the
character
and
the
use
and
the
form
didn't
change
at
all,
and
those
were
the
criteria
that
mattered.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
yes,
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
yes,
sir.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
you
can
exclude
the
public
from
the
gate.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
that
is
not
a
public
street,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
yes,
sir.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
well,
that
street,
your
honor,
i
would
call
a
driveway.
that's
what
it
is.
[laughter]
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
i
disagree
with
you.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
and
that,
your
honor--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--that's
true
too,
but
you
know,
i
have
never,
your
honor,
heard
anyone
with
a
grievance
say
let's
take
it
to
the
alley.
it's
always,
let's
take
it
to
the
street
because--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--your
honor,
that's
correct.
however,
those
same
issues,
of
course,
were
before
the
virginia
supreme
court.
the...
the
state,
the
petitioner,
did
not
even
challenge
standing
until
the
state
sought
cert
at
this
court.
the
question
presented
concerning
the
closest
issue
to
standing
was
whether
mr.
hicks
was
untimely
in
his
challenge
to
the
barment-trespass
policy.
the
state
in
all
of
the
state
courts
argued
that
mr.
hicks
should
have
challenged
his
barment
in
some
civil
proceeding,
and
that's
the
question
presented
on
page
97
of
the
joint
appendix
and
that
was
what
the
virginia
supreme
court
dealt
with,
it
having
been
the
only
issue
presented
to
them
on
this
at
page
158.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
if
it
is
true
to
say
that
the
virginia
court
necessarily
decided
the
standing
order,
it
not...
the
standing
issue,
it
not
having
been
raised.
but--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--yes,
sir.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
yes,
your
honor,
that
was
on
the
merits.
when
the
virginia
supreme
court
discussed
the
merits,
they
discussed
whether
there
was
overbreadth
and
whether
it
was
substantially
overbroad.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
you.
i
don't
think
they
decided
that
and
i
don't
think
it
was--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--your
honor,
because
it...
it
was
the...
the
immediate
issue
that
confronted
them.
they
were
confronted
with
a
policy
that
was
unconstitutional
in
so
many
fundamental
respects.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
your
honor,
if
the
virginia
supreme
court
did
implicitly
decide
the
standing
issue,
then
it
was
a
right
that
it
had
to
accept
this...
this
case
which
was,
as
the
government
concedes,
and
the
petitioner,
a
case
and
controversy.
mr.
hicks
was
convicted,
and
he
did
raise
all
of
these
constitutional
issues
in
defense
of
his
conviction.
and
if
the
virginia
supreme
court
implicitly
reached
the
standing
question,
then
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
state
rights,
it
was
entitled
to
do
that.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
your
honor,
my
response
is
that
in
the
ordinary
case,
such
as
some
of
your
hypotheticals
suggest,
it
would
become
instantly
apparent
that
the
robber,
although
claiming
that
the
statute
or
the
policy
is
overbroad...
it
would
become
instantly
apparent
that
he
had
no
basis
whatsoever
to
bring
this
motion.
if
he
even
got
to
a
hearing,
there
would
be
an
immediate
failure
of
proof,
but
it
wouldn't
get
to
a
hearing
because
there
would
be
a
motion
to
quash
the
motion
for
lack
of--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--in
this
policy
i
counted
eight
constitutional
errors.
in
this
case,
mr.
hicks'
conduct
was
expressive.
mr.
hicks
meets
virginia's
own
test
because
he
was
going
to
see
his
children,
and
there
is
no
expressive
action--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--your
honor,
i
understand
your
question,
and
mr.
hicks
at
the
inception
was
not
outraged
about
free
speech
and
first
amendment
issues.
he
was
outraged
about
the
fact
that
he
had
been
banned
for
apparently
nothing
more,
as
the
en
banc
virginia
court
found,
going
back
to
see
his
family
repeatedly.
he
was
upset
and
challenged
the
very
barment
proceeding
and
the...
the
entire
policy.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
the
en
banc
court
at
page
125,
footnote--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
not
the
supreme
court,
had
found,
your
honor,
that
the...
the
charge
of
damaging
property
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
barment,
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
or
in
the
evidence
suggesting
otherwise.
the
testimony
at
page
60
of
the
joint
appendix
does
not
permit
the
inference
urged
by
the
petitioner.
the
inference
at
most
urged...
that
you
could
draw
from
page
60,
the
testimony
there
is
that
the
police
quite
often
saw
mr.
hicks
in
the
development
and
he
gave
them
an
address,
and
then
ms.
rogers
would
confirm
that
he
did
not
live
there.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
your
honor,
what
gloria
rogers
is
doing
in
that
instance,
although
she
has
been
asked
the
specific
question,
how
did
kevin
hicks
come
to
be
barred,
she
begins,
as
she
does,
giving
a
general
answer
in
how
people
get
barred.
and
in
the...
she
began
with
that.
then
she
went
to
mr.
hicks'
case,
and
then
she
went
back
to
one
of
her
own
reasons
of
domestic
violence.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
yes,
your
honor.
we
had
sought
discovery
of
the
reasons
that
he
was
banned,
and
counsel
at
page
1312
and
13
had
said
that
counsel
needed
to
demonstrate
why
mr.
hicks
was
barred.
but
rrha
counsel,
the
housing
authority
counsel,
objected
that
the
reason
why
mr.
hicks
was
banned
was
irrelevant
because
being
a
private
property
owner,
the
position
was,
they
could
ban
anyone
at
any
time
for
any
reason.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
because,
your
honor,
as
you...
this
very
exchange
illustrates
how
unworkable
that
very
test
would
be
because
reasonable
people
will
disagree
over
whether
any
given
conduct
is
in
fact
expressive.
if
the
very
fact
that
mr.
hicks--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--because
the
whole
reason
for
the
exception
is
the
importance
of
first
amendment
rights
and
values.
to
impose
this
sort
of
a
test
would
defeat
the
purpose
and...
and
the
value,
the
opportunity
for
society
to
deal
with
laws
that
sweep
this
broadly
and
infringe
upon
and
violate
people's--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--because
i
think
the
virginia
supreme
court,
when
it
saw
the
entirety
of
this
policy,
including
not
just
the
first
amendment
issues,
but
the
vagueness
that
permeates
this
policy...
i
think
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
decided,
from
a
conservative
approach,
that
it
would
deal
with
the
most
to
it...
the
most
obvious
deficiency
and
that
is
the
complete
unfettered
discretion
that...
that
gloria
rogers,
the
housing
manager,
had,
that
every
single
police
officer
had,
and
deal
with
it
then
while
the
policy
was
before
it,
instead
of
going
on
and
settling
other
questions,
instead
of
requiring
that
challenges--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--mr.
hicks
didn't
need
the
first
amendment.
his
issue
from
the
very
beginning
began
with
the...
the
vagueness
that
permeates
this,
but
it...
he--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
i
lost
you
somewhat
during--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
yes.
and
that...
that...
but
it's
not
much
of
a
risk.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
because
those
challenges
would
fail
almost
immediately
because
it...
i
know
of
no
other
case
where
the
trespass
law
has
applied
so
pervasively
to
the
entire
streets
and
sidewalks
of
a
community.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
system
can
easily
deal
with
frivolous
motions
because
of
the
requirements
already
built
into
the
requirement.
overbreadth
must
not
only
exist
and
be
articulable,
it
must
be
substantial.
and
the
system
could
deal
with
that,
with
sanctions
if
necessary.
in
this
case
it
wasn't
enough
for
a
citizen
to
have,
in
fact,
a
legitimate
purpose
to
use
the
sidewalk.
he
had
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
he
had
a
legitimate
purpose.
the
legitimate
purpose
was
by
reference
solely
to
the
subjective
standards
of
any
particular
police
officer
or
gloria
rogers,
the
housing
manager.
there
was
no
housing
authority
handbook
of
what
constitutes
legitimate
business.
there
was
no
clear
meaning
as
to
what
legitimate
meant.
left
unsaid
would
be
whether
someone
could
go
onto
these
streets
and
sidewalks
if
their
business
was
to
argue
and
have
it
out
with
someone
or
to
go
meet
with
abortion
activists.
all
we
know
from
this
policy
is
that
before
you
can
use
these
sidewalks,
you
must
be
engaged
in
a
legitimate...
whatever
that
means...
business
or
social
reason,
which
by
its
own
terms--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--i
am--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--i
would,
but--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--your
honor,
you
can't
separate
vagueness
and
overbreadth,
and
this
argument
goes
directly
to
the
heart
of
first
amendment.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
i
think
that
this
court
has
used
the
terms
vagueness
and
overbreadth
interchangeably
and--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--i
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
was
taken
and
impressed
by
the
first
amendment
implications
that
are
produced
by
the
vagueness.
if
you
must
have
a
legitimate
business
or
social
purpose...
and
by
those
terms
what's
excluded
as
a
legitimate
purpose
are
lawful
purposes
like
wandering
or
jogging
because
that's
not
a...
a
business
or
social
purpose,
but
also
protected
purposes
such
as
distributing
fliers,
literature,
or
holding
religious
meetings.
that
does
not...
that
kind
of
conduct
at
least
arguably
does
not
fall
within
the
rubric
of
business
or
social--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--it
is
not,
your
honor,
because
this
policy
targeted
streets
in
the
first
place,
streets
and
sidewalks,
which
are...
a
principal
purpose
of
which
is
for
expressive
activity.
the
policy
itself
was
called
the
street
privatization
program.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
your
honor,
they...
they
can't...
the
government
can't
do
it
by
simply
saying
that
the
streets
are
private
and
simply
putting
up
signs
because--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--i
don't
understand.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
i
agree
that
the
challenge
can
be
made
if
counsel
sees
fit
to
do
so,
but
of
course,
he's
bound
by
the
state's
ethical
requirements.
and
the...
the
issue
won't
be
there
in
most
cases.
there
is
no
policy
that
is
going
to
be
as
vague
and
overbroad,
so
pervasive
in
its
effect
on
first
amendment
freedoms
as
well
as--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--your
honor,
yes.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
it's
not...
what
you
administer
is
what
has
always
been
administered,
the
requirement
of
a
finding
of
substantial
overbreadth.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
i
don't
think
that
in
chicago
v.
morales
that
there
was
any
claim
that
the
petitioners
in
that
case
were
involved
in
expressive
activity.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
that
was--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
was
in
forsyth
county.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
we
have
cases
such
as
watchtower,
for
example,
where
admittedly
in
watchtower,
jehovah's
witnesses
were
engaging
in
expressive
activity,
but
there
was
nothing
about
the
facts
of
that
case
or
the
ordinance
that
suggested
that
anyone
in
nonexpressive
activity
would
not
have
been
able
to
raise
the
substantial
overbreadth
challenge.
if
it
had
been
girls
scouts,
for
example.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
that
involved
the
chicago
anti-loitering
statute.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
right.
in
a
police...
a
two-part
test,
the
police--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--i
don't
know
that
this
court
reached
it
on
that
point.
it...
the
court
did
reach
overbreadth,
but
didn't
decide
on
overbreadth
because
the
statute...
see,
the
ordinance
explicitly
by
its
terms
did
not
reach
first
amendment
freedoms
or
protected
activity
because
you
had
to
be
doing
something
with
no
apparent
purpose.
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
under
that
ordinance,
it
wasn't
illegal.
that
didn't
violate
the
ordinance
because
that
was
an
apparent--
mr.
steven
d.
benjamin
--it
did
not
because
if
he
wanted
to
do
it
for
an
apparent
purpose
of
expressive
activity,
then
it
didn't
violate,
and
so
that
was
not
a
problem.
in
this
case
we
have
the
extraordinary
situation
that
a
person
must
have
government
permission,
police
permission
to
walk
a
street,
to
use
a
sidewalk,
and
his
right
to
do
this
depends
entirely
upon
the
completely
unfettered
discretion
of
the
police
and
a
government
official.
if
someone
wants
to
go
onto
that
sidewalk
and
pass
out
literature,
they
must
get
permission.
they
must
get
gloria
rogers'
permission,
and
she
can
give
that
permission
or
deny
that
permission
in
accordance
with
whatever
criteria
she
uses
at
any
given
moment.
the
first
amendment
problems
with
this
case
are
substantial
and
pervasive.
the
virginia
supreme
court
saw
that
and
dealt
with
it
while
it
was
there,
seeing
nothing
redeemable
about
this
policy
whatsoever.
