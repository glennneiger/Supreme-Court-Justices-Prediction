mr.
william
h.
hurd
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
this
trespass
policy
took
effect,
the
families
in
whitcomb
court
lived
in
the
middle
of
an
open-air
drug
market.
surely
those
who
must
rent
from
public
housing
ought
not
be
required
by
the
law
to
live
in
greater
danger
from
criminals
than
those
who
rent
from
private
landlords.
and
yet,
that
is
the
consequence
of
the
decision
below
and
its
mistaken
application
of
the
first
amendment.
this
defendant
is
a
common
trespasser,
not
engaged
in
any
expressive
activity.
the
court
below
struck
down
the
trespass
policy
only
by
indulging
in
an
extravagant
expansion
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
in
the
record,
your
honor,
that
the
state
supreme
court
was
doing
anything
other
than
applying
what
it
thought
was
this
court's
overbreadth
jurisprudence.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
your
honor,
you
don't
need
to
assume
that
in
this
case.
they...
they
discussed
the
question
of
standing
in
their
opinion,
and
they
referred
to
this
court
and
this
court's
traditional
rule
and
the
overbreadth
rule,
never
suggesting
for
a
moment
that
they
thought
virginia
might
have
a
more
generous
rule
of
standing
than
this
court
has
required.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
they
did.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
there
is
no
citation
when
discussing
the...
the
standing
issue,
the
overbreadth
issue
at
all.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they...
they
cite
this
court's
cases,
and
this
is
found
joint
appendix
page
159.
it
says
the
supreme
court...
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
the
second
complete
paragraph...
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
in
the
context
of
a
first
amendment
challenge,
a
litigant
may
challenge
government
action
granting
government
officials
standardless
discretion
even
if
that
government
action
as
applied
to
the
litigant
is
constitutionally
permissible.
they
then
cite
this
court's
decision
in
los
angeles
police
department.
they
then
go
on
to
cite
this
court's
decision
in
ferber
and
in
broadrick
and
in
gooding
v.
wilson
and
in
dombrowski
and
in
thornhill,
never
suggesting
for
a
moment
that
virginia
has
a
more
generous
notion
of
overbreadth
standing--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--it
certainly
could
do
that,
your
honor.
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
historically
adhered
very
closely
in
its
interpretation
of
the
state
constitutional
standards
to
the
standards
laid
down
by
this
court
under
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
well,
your
honor--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
they...
they
believe
they
are
required
by
this
court's
jurisprudence
to
grant--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
i
believe
we...
we
do
know
based
on
the
portions
of
the
record
i
read.
they
relied
solely
upon
this
court's
overbreadth
standing
jurisprudence.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
your
honor,
i...
i
think
of
the...
the
recently
decided
case
of
virginia
v.
black
cross
burning
where
in
that
case
the
criminal
defendant
raised
claims
under
both
federal
and
state
law.
it
decided
it
under
the
federal.
it
did
not
decide
it
under
the
state.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
no,
your
honor--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--that's--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
that
is
correct.
a...
a
state
may
well
be
able
to
adopt
a
broader
interpretation
of
standing
than
this
court
requires,
but
it
cannot
adopt
a
narrower
interpretation.
it
cannot
disregard
this
court's
direction
that
you
give
overbreadth
standing
according
to
the
federal
constitutional
standards,
according
to
this
court's
standards.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
at
all
that
it
was
adopting
a
broader
interpretation.
it
said
that
this
court...
i'm
paraphrasing,
of
course.
but
it
says
this
court's
standing
rule...
its
traditional
standing
rules
do
not
apply
in
these
overbreadth
cases,
and
then
it
cites
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
that's--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
the
state
supreme
court
has
no
discretion
to
disregard
this
court's
application
of
the
first
amendment
through
its
overbreadth
doctrine.
here,
what
happened--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--they
could
have,
your
honor,
but
there's
no
indication
that
they
did.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
they
didn't
say
so.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
well--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--well,
your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
problems
with...
with
mr.
hicks'
case,
one
of
which
is
exactly
the
one
you
described.
we
think
that
there
are
several
aspects
of
that.
we
think
one
aspect
of
standing.
we
think
another
aspect
is
that
this
court's
practice
has
been
not
to
allow
overbreadth
challenges
to
be
brought
in
cases
where
it
was
not
a...
a
speech-related
statute
or
a
statute
governing
something
closely
related
to
speech.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and...
and
certainly--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--it...
that
is
certainly
our
argument,
your
honor.
standing
is
one
problem
with
mr.
hicks'
case.
but
even
if
he
had
standing,
there's
a
problem
here
of
not
meeting
the
requirement
that
alleged
overbreadth
be
substantial.
in
fact,
the
state
supreme
court
didn't
address
this
prong
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine
at
all.
and
it's
clear,
we
believe,
that
even
if
there
were
some
possible
unconstitutional
application
of
this
policy,
that
the
overbreadth
would
not
be
substantial.
the
legitimate
sweep
of
this
policy
is
very
broad.
it
sweeps
up
those
who
come
to
whitcomb
court
to
deal
drugs
and
batter
women
and
damage
property
and
steal
and
intimidate
and
try
to
make
this
property
their
turf.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
your
honor,
that
is...
that
is
not
exactly
the...
what
the
policy
says.
the--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--the
policy
is--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--no,
your
honor,
but
in
terms
of...
of
the
legitimate
sweep,
if
we
tried
to
contrast
the
legitimate
sweep
of
the
policy--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
risk
that
any
legitimate
speaker
will
be
chilled
is...
is
very
small.
in
fact,
you
know,
the
policy
was
developed
to
chase
away
the
ne'er-do-wells
i
have
described,
and
if
we're
unable
to
remove
the
criminals,
it
would
not
be
safe
for
people
to
come
and
engage
in
speech.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
your
honor,
it...
it
does
not
apply
to...
just
to
ne'er-do-wells,
and
the
problem
is
how
do
you
know
until
you
actually
catch
them
in
the
act
of
dealing
drugs?
mr.
william
h.
hurd
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the...
the
policy
is
explained
by
gloria
rogers,
the
housing
manager,
on
page
32
of
the
joint
appendix.
there's
a
question
and
an
answer
at
the
bottom.
if
a
nonresident...
question...
if
a
nonresident
is
seen
on
privatized
public
housing
property
and
he
cannot
demonstrate
that
he
is
either
visiting
a
lawfully
residing
resident
or
conducting
legitimate
business,
is
he
an
authorized...
an
unauthorized
person?
mr.
william
h.
hurd
it...
it
certainly
could,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
absolutely.
it
all
could
be
included
under
the
concept
of
visiting
residents,
going
door
to
door
to
visit
them
and
hand
them
material.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
your
honor,
we
would
characterize
that
not
so
much
as
an
interpretation
of
the
written
policy
as
an
addendum--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--an
addendum
to
it
which
requires
the
demonstration
of
legitimate
purpose,
which
is
discussed
in
the
policy,
which
would
require
that
demonstration
be
made
to
the
housing
manager
to
show
that
the
leafleting
is
legitimate.
that--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
he
certainly
has
this...
this
due
process
right
to
wander
issue
preserved.
there's
a
question
that
the
state
supreme
court
did
not
address,
which
is
whether
these
streets
and
sidewalks
are
a
traditional
public
forum
or
a
nonpublic
forum.
and
he
has
certainly
asserted
the
right
to...
to
be
there...
the
right
to--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--that
would
be
a
substantive
due
process
challenge
there.
he
also
has
raised
below
a...
a
vagueness
challenge.
it's
a
little
different
than
the
one
he
raises
here.
but
he
would
have
that
available
to
him
as
well.
so
that
the...
the
only...
your
honor,
the...
the
only
argument
he
raised
below
in
the
state
supreme
court
that
would...
that
would
not
be
available
to
him
upon
remand
would
be
the
one
decided
by
this
court.
and
all
the
other
issues
he
pressed
below
before
the
state
supreme
court
he
could
press
again.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
no,
your
honor,
it's
not.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
no,
your
honor.
the...
the
policy
is
not
intended
to
convey
the
idea--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that's
the
case.
i
believe
that...
that
the
phrase
unauthorized
persons
calls
into
question,
well,
who...
who
is
authorized
and--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--your
honor,
in
the
context
of
a
private
apartment
complex,
it
would
not
mean
that.
a
private
apartment
complex
or
a
public
apartment
complex
where
a
tenant
has
a
leasehold
interest
has
the
right
to
invite
people
to
come
to
that
premises
without
having
to
have
the
landlord
grant
permission.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
it
is...
it
is
not
the
signs.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
it
is...
it
is
the
policy--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--it
is
the
policy
that
is...
that
is
challenged,
not...
not
the
signs.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
we're
taking
the
position
they
must
be
read
together,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
a...
a
person
might
be
able
to
read
the
sign
in
isolation
and
believe
that
they
had
to
get
some
permission
to
come
in
advance,
but
the
people
who
come
to
the...
to
this
housing
complex
and
do
so
legitimately
typically
receive
invitations
from
the
residents.
so
they
understand.
the
residents
understand
what
the
policy
is.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
your
honor,
two...
two
points
on
that.
the...
the
first
point
is
had
he
not
been
barred,
certainly
coming
to
visit
his
family
would
be
a
legitimate
purpose.
but
once
he
is
barred...
and
he
was...
he
was
barred
under
this--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--well,
the...
the
record
suggests
on
page
60
that
there
may
have
been
some
domestic
violence
in
the
background.
we
do
not
know
the
specific
facts
of
that.
but
we
do
know
that
that
is
referred
to
by
gloria
rogers
on
page
60
of
the
joint
appendix.
there's
also
a
reference
on
that
same
page
to
giving
out
false
information
about
addresses
he
allegedly
lived
at
in
the
premises.
he
did
plead
guilty
twice
to
trespassing
and
was
convicted
of
damaging
property.
he
does
not
challenge
the
particular
reasons
why
he
was
barred,
and
if
he
wants
to
deliver
diapers,
he
should
have
thought
about
that
before
his
misconduct
earned
him
this
barment
notice
and
he
thereby
forfeited
his
right
to
return.
besides,
your
honor,
justice
ginsburg,
there's
no
evidence
anyone
saw
any
diapers
or
that
he
was
there
on
such
an
errand
other
than
what
he
said.
and
when
he
asked
gloria
rogers
to
let
him
back
on
the
property,
he
never
mentioned
visiting
the
child
or
the
child's
mother.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
they
do,
and
had
he
not
engaged
in
misconduct,
the
situation
never
would
have
arisen.
but
it
certainly
cannot--
mr.
william
h.
hurd
--we...
we
do
not,
your
honor.
we
do
not.
the...
there
was
no
testimony
at
trial
from
the
mother
that
she
had
asked
him
to
come
or
that
he
had
brought
her
diapers
or...
or
any
of
that.
we
have
no
idea
whether
he
is
welcome
there
or
not.
but
the...
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
surely
it
cannot
be
the
law
that
a
desire
to
visit
one's
mother
or
one's
girlfriend
trumps
a
barment
notice
regardless
of
how
bad
the
individual's
prior
conduct
may
have
been.
he
did
not
challenge
that
barment
notice
by
saying,
well,
it
wasn't
bad
enough.
what
we
do
know
in
the
record
is
that
it
was
pretty
bad:
two
prior
instances
of
trespass,
damaging
property,
and
so
forth.
in
sum...
i
see
my
time
is...
is
running
out.
i'd
like
to
reserve
some
of
it.
in
sum,
we
have
families
here
living
in
desperate
circumstances,
marijuana
for
sale
on
bethel
street,
crack
cocaine
on
ambrose,
heroin
over
on
deforrest
street.
the
overbreadth
doctrine
was
designed
to
remedy
situations
where
a
challenged
statute
chills
the
rights
of
others
not
before
the
court.
here
it's
not
this
trespass
policy
that
chills
the
right
of
free
speech,
but
the
dangerous
conditions
at
whitcomb
court
that
the
policy
was
designed
to
alleviate.
we
ask
that
the
judgment
below
be
vacated.
thank
you.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
william
h.
hurd
thank
you,
your
honor.
