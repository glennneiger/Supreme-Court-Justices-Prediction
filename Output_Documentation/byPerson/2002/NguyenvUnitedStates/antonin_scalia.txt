there
was
no
objection.
justice

and
not
to
void
if
he...
if
he
won.
right?
and
not
to
void
it
if
he
won.
that's
a
nice
position
to
be
in.
you
just
sit
there,
don't
make
any
objection.
if
you
win
the
case,
everything
is
fine,
and
if
you
lose
the
case,
you
play
dog
in
the
manger
and...
and
come
up
here
and
say,
oop,
this
was
an
improper
panel.
that
doesn't
sound
to
me
the...
the...
like
the
way
the
system
ought
to
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
green,
suppose...
suppose
i
disagree
with
you
that...
that
you...
you
can
sit
through
a
trial
and
not
object
with...
with
impunity,
and...
and
i
think
that
you
lose
here
unless
you
can
show
plain
error
and
the
usual
requirements
for
avoiding
the
rule
about...
about
contemporaneous
objection.
why
do
you
come
within
the
plain
error
requirements
and,
in
particular,
the
requirement
that...
that
there
have...
that...
that
the
mistake
seriously
affect
the
fairness,
integrity,
or
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings?
why...
why
is
that
the
case?
you
acknowledge
that
your
client
could
have
been
tried
by
non-article
iii
judges.
you
acknowledge
that
the
judge
who
sat,
although
he
was
non-article
iii,
was
a
federal
judge
properly
appointed.
he
could
have
tried
your
client.
so
how
can
i
say
that
this...
that
the
proceeding...
yes,
there
was
a...
there
was
a
mistake,
but
did...
was
it...
was
it
a
mistake
that
seriously
affected
the
fairness,
integrity,
or
public
reputation
of
the
proceeding?
i...
i
just
don't
see
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
he...
he
should
resign
if
he
feels
that
way,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
he
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
statute,
in
effect,
says...
if...
if
you
take
that
position,
the
statute,
in
effect,
says,
we
don't
want
an
article
iii
court.
let's...
let's
concede
that
with...
with
the
one
article
i
judge
sitting
on
it,
it
ceases
to
be
an
article
iii
court.
but
that...
the
statute
says
that.
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that--
--to
get...
to
get
due
process,
you...
you
get
to...
you
get
to
that
portion
of
the
plain
error
doctrine
which
says
plain
error
applies
if
it
seriously
affects
the
integrity
or
fairness
of
the
proceeding.
and
if
you
have
the
president
of
the
guam
bar
association
sitting
on
the
court,
doesn't
that
seriously
affect
the
fairness
of
the
proceeding
in
a
manner
that...
that
having
a...
an
article
iv
judge
does
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
please
don't
tell
us
that
they're
asking
for
express
waivers.
