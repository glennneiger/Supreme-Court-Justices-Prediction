justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
counsel,
may
i
ask
you,
in
this
case,
is
it
possible
that
a
quorum
of
the
court
would
consist
of
two
members
of
a
three-member
panel
on
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
even...
even
though
the
panel
was
unanimous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
if...
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
and
it
went
back,
could
the
same
two
remaining
judges
constitute
a
properly
arranged
panel
and
decide
the
case
again?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
same
two
could
be
on
a
new
panel,
however.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
this...
is
this
a
right
that
can
be
waived?
no
objection
was
made
to
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
green,
how
does
article
iii...
how
can
article
iii
be
claimed
by
your
client
who
was
tried
not
before
an
article
iii
court,
before
a
territorial
court...
your
client
has
no
entitlement
to
an
article
iii
court.
so
this
seems...
you're
addressing
an
abstract
question
about
the
proper
composition
of
a
ninth
circuit
panel.
yet,
your
litigant,
your
client
has
no
entitlement
to
an
article
iii
tribunal
either
at
trial
or
on
appeal.
so
i
think
that
there's
a
serious
problem
of
whether
your
clients
are
positioned
to
raise
the
proper
composition
of
an
article
iii
court
when
they
are
not
even
entitled
to
an
article
iii
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
it
didn't
have
to.
in
other
words,
a
case...
an
article
iii...
a
case
in
which
litigants
are
entitled
to
an
article
iii
tribunal
then
must
go
to
an
article
iii
court.
here
congress
did
designate
the
ninth
circuit
to
hear
these
appeals
from
non-article
iii
trial
courts.
but
your
clients...
congress
didn't
have
to
do
that
with
respect
to
your
clients.
congress
could
have
given
them
an
article
iv
appellate
tribunal
and
that
would
have
been
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
congress
created
the
district
court
for
the
northern
marianas,
for
guam,
what
authority
was
it
exercising?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
panel
had
included
a
judge
who
was
holding
a
recess
appointment,
a
federal
judge
who
was
appointed
on
a
recess
basis
and
therefore
at
that
point
didn't
have
secure
tenure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
odd
in
a...
in
a
circuit
that
has
the
vast
majority
of
its
appeals
decided
without
any
oral
argument.
you
said
that
the
defendant
has
to
be
there?
your
party
has
to
be
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
important
right
that
you...
you
were
relying
on,
it's
her
right
only
because
there
happens
to
be
a
statute
that
sets
up
the
ninth
circuit
as
the
appellate
forum.
you
have
recognized
that
she
did
not
have
any
independent
right
to
that
kind
of
forum.
she
could
have
had...
since
the
court...
the...
the
authority
at
trial
is
determined
by
article
iv,
similarly
for
territory
authority
on
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
ordinarily
statutory
rights
can
be
forfeited
if
you
don't
assert
them
at
the
earliest
time
when
you
reasonably
could.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i'm
not
using
the
word
waiver.
it's
not
a
question
of
a
person
consenting,
but
forfeiting
by
not
raising
it
at
the
earliest
reasonable
stage.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
millett,
i'm
surprised
at
the
answers
that
you're
giving,
that
they're
not
prefaced
by
what
you
said...
i
thought
you
said...
in
your
brief
which
was
that
congress
did
not
enact
a
statute
that
allowed
the
ninth
circuit
to
include
one
of
these
judges.
the
court
shouldn't
speculate
on
the
constitutionality
of
a
different
statute.
the
statute
that
congress,
in
fact,
enacted
said
that
it
was
wrong
to
include
this
judge,
and
so
the
only
question
should
be
what
is
the
consequence
of
the
ninth
circuit
having
failed
to
follow
the
statute
that
congress
enacted
instead
of
speculating
on,
oh,
suppose
congress
had,
in
fact,
enacted...
enacted
such
a
statute.
but
you...
you
seem
to
be
engaging
in
the...
the
hypothetical
statute
that
congress
didn't
enact
to
determine
whether
it
would
be
constitutional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i...
may
i
ask
you
a
very
practical
question
that...
this
case
is
now
here.
so
it
has
gotten
some
notice.
what
is
the
ninth
circuit
currently
doing
with
respect
to
panels
that
review
decisions
from
guam,
from
samoa,
from
northern
marianas?
is
the
ninth
circuit
continuing
to
use
territorial
judges
to
fill
out
their
panels,
or
has
it
stopped
doing
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems
it
couldn't
be
pure
accident
because
the...
the
chief
judge
of
the
circuit
would
have
to
designate
that
judge.
so
that
was
an
advertent
act
that
she
designated
this
territorial
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
the
answer
to
that
you
just
treat
them
like
unpublished
decisions?
they
have
no
precedential
value.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
article
iii
courts
do
issue
unpublished...
quote,
unpublished.
of
course,
they
are
published,
but
non-precedential.
