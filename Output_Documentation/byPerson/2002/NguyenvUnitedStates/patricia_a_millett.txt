ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
a
statutory
violation
occurred,
and
there's
also
no
dispute
that
no
challenge
was
made
to
that
violation
below.
the
narrow
question
presented
is
whether
these
individual
defendants
are
entitled
to
reversal
under
the
plain
error
doctrine--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the...
there
certainly
would
still
be
a
statutory
violation
in
those
cases
absolutely.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
absolutely.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
plain
error
i
think
is--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--a
higher
standard.
i
certainly
hope
someone
would
object,
but
if
they
don't
and
assuming
that
it's
a
case
coming
out
of
the
territory
again,
then
we
would
go
back
to
the
same
analysis
and
say
whether...
could
congress
create...
if
congress
could
create
a
court
that
consisted
of
two
judges
and
guam--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--and
a
lawyer--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the...
i
think
our
position
would
be
the
same
as
it
is
here.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i'm
putting
aside
any
sort
of
due
process
concerns
that
might
apply--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
in
american
insurance
company
versus
canter,
which
was
opinion
by
chief
justice
marshall
at
the
beginning
of
this
nation,
dealing
with
territorial
cases,
it
addressed
there
a
court
that
consisted
of
a
lawyer
and
five...
i'm
sorry...
a
notary
and
five
jurors
in
a
territory--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--justice
kennedy,
i
think
there
are
difficult
constitutional
questions
that
would
be
raised
if
congress
were
to
prescribe
this.
i
think
based
on
the
analysis
in
our
brief,
it
is
a
statute
we
could
defend.
but
there
would
be
difficult
constitutional
questions
if
that
happened.
what
happened
here
was
a
mistake,
not
a
confrontation
between
the
branches
with
congress
trying
to
change
our--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think,
your
honor,
what
would
prevent
them
is
a
decision
from
this
court
declaring
limitations
on
their
statutory
appointment
power.
and
if
this
court...
and
if
the
ninth
circuit--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--and
if...
and
if
the
ninth
circuit
were
to
engage,
which
is
not
to
be
presumed
by
governmental
officials,
court
or
executive...
but
were
to
engage
in
some
pattern
of
violating
the
statute,
i
think
this
court's
supervisory
authorities
could
take
care
of
that.
but
in
an
individual
case
like
this,
where
there
was
no
assertion
of
the
right,
this
question
would
still
be
the
same.
did
plain
error
occur
that
affected
the
substantial
rights
of
these
particular
defendants?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
hope
so.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think,
your...
your
honor,
that...
that
we
would
defend
that
statute,
and
we
think
that
it
would
be
permissible,
assuming...
i
mean,
the...
a
better
way
to
approach
it
is
that
the
analysis
that
would
be
applied
would
be
as
this
court
did
in
mistretta
versus
the
united
states.
and
you
would
focus
on...
and
a
number
of
cases.
you
would
focus
on
what
is
the
nature
of
the
job
that's
being
imposed.
it's
a
judicial
function.
it
wouldn't
be
asked
to
do
some
sort
of
article
i
function.
and
would
doing
that
function
so
distract
or
withdraw
from
the
burden...
i'm
sorry...
distract
or
interrupt
the
judge's...
or
court's
ability
to
function
as
an
article
iii
court.
that
would
be
the
analysis.
now,
to...
to
put
a
finer
point
on
it,
in
fact...
and
the
reason
i
have
to
take
the
position
it
would
be
okay,
is
congress
has
enacted
a
statute,
28
u.s.c.
297,
which
authorizes
judges
of
the
ninth
circuit
to
go
sit
in
the
freely
associated
compact
states,
which
is
micronesia
and
the
marshall
islands,
which
are
not--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
i
understand,
justice
kennedy.
there
are
two
points
to
your
question.
i
would
like
to
get
to
them
both.
the
first
is,
would
it
violate
the
constitution
to...
does
it
violate
the
constitution
to
have
someone
who's
not
an
article
iii
judge
sit
with
the
ninth
circuit
on
a
given
day?
and
our
position
is
that
congress
could
do
it
and
that
we
would
defend
that
statute
based
on
the
analysis
i
gave--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
not
on
this
court.
i
think
this
court
has
unique
status.
the
supreme
court
has
unique
status
under
the
constitution.
there
shall
be
one
supreme
court,
and
its
composition
is
specifically
defined
by
article
i
and
nobody
in
congress
has
any
authority
or
power
to
change
that.
but
if
you're
talking
about
the
territories,
could
congress
say
they
have
no
right
to
appeal
at
all?
yes.
could
congress
say
your
appeal
will
be
within
the
limit...
as
long
as
it
doesn't
violate
due
process
or
a
fundamental
right,
will
be
to
three
state
court
judges?
now,
the
more
difficult
question
is,
could
you
have
the
combination
as
we
had
here?
and
we
think
under
the
analysis
of
united
states
versus
mistretta,
that
would
be
okay,
but
in...
in
particular,
as
to
territorial
residents.
but
even
if
it's
not--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
at
least
in
territorial
cases.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
way
we
get
to
this
position
is
two
steps.
is
first...
there
isn't,
obviously,
clearly
on
point,
but
if
you
add
mistretta
to
morrison
versus
olson,
which
had
a
delegation
of
non-article
iii
functions
to...
to...
that's
the...
the
independent
counsel
case...
to
the
special
division
that
appoints
the
independent
counsel...
and
so
you
combine
that
and
you
combine
that
with
the
precedents
on
sharing
of
power
with
magistrate
judges...
those
together...
and
then
add
to
all
of
that
the
very
limited
constitutional
rights
to...
to
a
particular
form
of
tribunal
accorded
to
people
in
the
territories.
but
i
also
wanted
to
get
back...
we
think
that
it
could
be
defended.
but
even
if
the
answer
is
no,
we
don't
think
the
constitutional
violation
would
be
plain
error.
but
to
get
back
to
your
binding
precedent
point,
which
i
think
is
an
important
one,
it's...
there's
three
things
to
keep
in
mind.
first
of
all,
whether
this
is
a
binding
precedent
or
not
has
absolutely
no
effect
on
the
claims
of
these
individual
defendants.
their
position
would
be
the
same
if
the
decision
were
unpublished.
and
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
has
itself
in
a
difficult
position
here.
it
should
address,
in
the
first
case,
the
power
of
this
precedent.
and
it's
not
an
issue
this
court
has
never
considered.
in
glidden...
the
glidden
company
case,
the
two
concurring
justices
specifically
said...
they...
they
agreed
that
the
court
was
competent
at
least...
it
was
an
article
iii
court...
after...
at
least
after
congress
had
passed
the
statute
giving
them
that
status.
but
if
those
two
concurring
justices,
which
provided
the
most
narrow
ground
for
decisions
in
that
case,
specifically
said
that
they
would
think...
they
would
uphold
the
validity
of
those
decisions
that
were
issued
prior
to
congress'
action.
and
i
think
this
court's
de
facto
officer
doctrine
would
speak
to
whether
unchallenged...
unchallenged
opinions
should
at
some
point
have--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
we
absolutely
agree.
i
was
trying
to
be
responsive
to
questions
that
were
posed.
but
we
absolutely
agree
that
this
is
not
the
appropriate
case
to
address
limitations
on
congressional
power
over
appellate
review
in
territorial
cases.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
right.
well,
justice
kennedy,
if
we're
talking
about
now
reversal
under
the
plain
error
doctrine,
then
the
types
of
structural
errors
in
which
this
court
has
found
reversal
to
be
appropriate
under
the
plain
error
doctrine
to
violate
substantial
rights
or
even
to
make
harmless
error
analysis
inapplicable
have...
is
a
very
narrow,
small
class.
and
those
are...
those
are
errors--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the...
the
fourth
prong
of
the
plain
error
analysis
is
whether
the...
the
error
seriously
affected
the
fairness
or
integrity
of
judicial
proceedings,
which
would
seem
to
be
responsive
to...
to
your
concern,
and
that
would
be
the
appropriate
place
to
put
it.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that...
that
the
types
of
errors
that
are
deemed
structural
under
the
plain
error...
i'm
not
talking
about
structure
under
article
iii...
are
things
that
go
to...
and
i
think
that
would
satisfy
prong
four...
are
things
that
go
to
whether
the
court
essentially
functioned
as
a
court.
does
it...
is
it
consistent
with
the
basic
precepts
that
underlie
our
judicial
system?
was
there
race
discrimination?
was
it
a
public
trial
where
they
completely
denied--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
justice
stevens,
we're
asking
this...
in
theory
that
could
happen,
but
i
think
we're
asking
this
court
to
decide
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
judges,
like
executive
officers,
attempt
to
comply
with
the
constitution
and
don't
intentionally
defy
rulings
of
this
court
or
statutes--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but...
right--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but,
justice
stevens,
before
this
court
would
address
whether
it's
waivable,
it
would
say
whether
it's
wrong.
this
is
isn't
that
something
that
was
just--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
and
so
i
think
it's
one
thing
to
have
a
right
that...
that
is...
that
is,
you
know,
parties
can
do
with
one
way
or
the
other
and
the
statute
or
the
law
doesn't
speak
to
it.
but
where
this
court...
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with,
i
think,
both
of
this
in
this
case
that
this
was
wrong,
that
i
don't
think
we
would
presume
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
going
to
go...
keep
doing...
and...
and
the
justice
department
isn't
going
to
defend
it.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
justice...
justice
souter.
i
think
you
can
have
errors
that
are
wrong,
but
the
question
is
whether
in...
in...
by
not
objecting
to
that,
they're
entitled
to
relief.
that's
different--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--than
whether
it's
a
right
they
can
waive.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
justice
souter--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--justice
souter,
when
we're
talking
about
waiver
here,
we
are
talking
about
something
that
is
unconstitutional,
just
like
someone
could
waive
their...
can
waive
their
right
to
an
article
iii
tribunal,
but
if
congress
passed
a
statute
that
violated
it,
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional
for
the
court
to
sit
in
that
manner.
we
don't
think
this
is
an
unconstitutional
issue.
but
waiver
is
not
the
same
as
it's
something
the
parties
can
freely
take
or
drop
because
you
have
to
go
back
and...
to
the
step
before
that
and
say
this
is
wrong
and
it
won't
be
done
and
it
shouldn't
be
done.
but
if
we
assume
that...
we're...
we're
in
the
context
of
plain
error
analysis
here.
that's
why
the
concept
of
waiver
is
being
discussed.
it's
not
whether
a
mistake
was
made
or
whether
these
people
have
the
right
freely
to
choose.
they
don't,
under
the
statute,
have
the
right
freely
to
choose
what
the
composition
of
the
panel
will...
will
be.
we
agree
with
that.
but
when
no
objection
was
made
below,
proceedings
were
completed,
an
appeal
was
completed
without
any
objection,
they
fully
and
freely
participated
in
that,
and
it
was
only
after
the
outcome
that
they
turned
around
to
challenge
the...
the
composition
of
their
court,
that's
an
important
value
too.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
i
think
this
court's
clear
rules
are
that
constitutional
questions
should
not
be
decided
unnecessarily.
and
it's
not
necessary
to
resolution
of
this
case
to
say
what
would
happen
if
there
was
a
full
decision
by
congress
to
enact
a
statute
to
make
it...
to
engage
a
confrontation
between
the
branches
and
to
analyze
whether
that
would
be
appropriate--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--and
even
if
it's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--and...
and
our
position
will
be
even...
we
don't
think
it's
a
constitutional
violation
not
because
of
what
congress
can
do
or
not
do,
but
because
even
if
it
violates
article
iii,
that's
no
injury
to
people
who
have--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no
article
iii
protections.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mm-hmm.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that...
no,
i...
thank
you
for
saying
much
more
articulately
than
i've
been
able
to
what...
what
our
point
is
about
waiver
versus
plain
error.
and
i
think
that's
exactly
right.
and
does...
does
this
affect
the
judicial...
judicial
integrity
has
to
be
analyzed
in
the
context
of
these
individual
defendants.
the
decision
should
not
be
if
this
particular
error
occurred
writ
large
across
the
nation
by
courts,
would
it
violate
judicial
integrity--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--as
to
whether
this--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
there...
the...
the
types
of
things
that
are
not
even
subject
to
harmless
error
are
not
whether
a
mistake
was
made
under
article
iii.
in
fact,
in
ex
parte
ward,
this
court
under
the
de
facto...
de
facto
officer
doctrine
sustained
the
actions
of
the...
of
a
recess
appointment
judge.
but
the
question
is
whether
it's
something
that
essentially
means
this
wasn't
functioning
as
a
court.
it
is
that
profound.
this
is
inconsistent
with
our--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
grateful
to
say
that
we
at
least
don't
know
of
that
if
they
are
doing
it.
but
as
far
as
we
know,
this...
this
was
an
isolated
incident.
the
ninth
circuit
sat
in
the
northern
mariana
islands
just
last
month,
february,
and
had
a
full
complement
of
article
iii
judges.
it
had
never
happened...
it
had
happened
back
in
the
'50s,
but
it--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
there's
no
doubt.
and
there's
no
doubt
that...
that
a
conscious
decision
to
appoint
this
judge
was
made,
but
i
think
the
question
went
to
whether...
as
i
understood
it,
went
to
whether
there's
an
ongoing
problem
or
a
policy.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
there
is
no
policy
that
we're
aware
of
of
doing
this.
it
hadn't
happened
for
50
years.
it
hasn't
happened
since
this
court
granted
certiorari.
no
reason
to
think
it...
that
they're
going
to
do
it,
at
least
until
this
court
rules,
and
on
the
assumption
that
this
court
will
agree
with
both
parties
in
this
case
and
tell
them
that
it
is
wrong
to
do
that,
that
it
won't
happen
again.
and
that's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it's
wrong.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
i
think--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--with
respect,
justice
kennedy,
it's
not
that
it's...
it's
right
with
a
waiver.
it
is
still
proscribed
by
statute.
it
is
still
unlawful.
the...
the
waiver
issue
is
only
whether
when
the...
when
an
objection
wasn't
made,
are...
are
the
defendants
entitled
to
the
extraordinary
relief
of
plain
error.
that's
not
a
routine
type
of
waiver.
that
is...
is
it
was
wrong.
we
all
know
it's
wrong,
and...
and...
but
do
these...
does
it...
did
it
really
hurt
the
interests
either
of
these
defendants
or,
in
this
particular
proceeding,
did
it
offend
judicial
integrity.
and
we
think
because
of
the
narrow
context
in
which
this
was
decided...
it
was
a
territorial
case...
to
have
a
territorial
judge
sitting
with
two
ninth
circuit
judges,
statutorily
wrong...
maybe
there's
debate
about
whether
it
would
be
constitutionally
permissible.
but
it
did
not
make
this
no
longer
a
court.
it
did
not
rise
to
the
level
of
race
discrimination
or
total--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
justice
souter.
our
position
is
that
it
would
not
because
you
had
a
quorum
of
ninth
circuit
judges
here,
and
a
quorum
is
sufficient
under
28
u.s.c.,
a
quorum
of
two
on
this
panel,
to
decide--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
not
going
to
argue
that
this
type
of
error
is
not
what
congress
was
anticipating
in
the
quorum
provision.
but
it's
not
that
far,
if
you
think
of
what
happens
when
a
panel
sits
and
then
a
judge
recuses
himself
after
argument,
once
the
case
is
submitted.
and
so
they
have
participated.
their...
obviously
their
name
would
not
be
on
the
opinion.
that
would
be
one
distinction.
but
the
fact
that
the
judge
sat
there
and
participated
and
could
have
had
some
influence...
it
would
be
unknown...
would
not
go
to
the
power
of
the
court
to
act.
and
this
court
has
made
the
distinctions
in
ex
parte
ward,
four
justices
in
the
freytag,
and
as
far
back
as
martin
versus
hunter's
lessee,
the
power
of
the
court
to
act,
the
ninth
circuit
to
act
with
a
quorum
here,
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
lawfulness
which...
with
which
they
acted.
in
ex
parte
ward,
a...
a
recess
appointment
federal
judge,
who
lacked
tenure,
by...
by
definition
lacked
salary
guarantees,
sat.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
this
court
said
that
this
court,
whichever
district
court
it
was...
i
forget,
i'm
sorry...
had
jurisdiction.
the
wrong
person
being
there
exercising
it
goes
to
the
lawfulness
with
which
the
court
acted.
and
so
i
think
because
we
had
a
quorum
here,
the
ninth
circuit
had
power
to
act.
it
acted
unlawfully
in
the
exercise
of
that
power,
but--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--my
answer
on
jurisdiction
would
be
the
same.
my
answer
on...
on
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--to
clarify,
justice
souter,
i
was
talking
specifically
about
power.
on
prong
four,
i
think
we
would
have
a
much
harder
row
to...
row
to
hoe
if
we
had
to
show
that
it
did
not
affect
integrity
to
have
a
director
of
tourism
sit
on
a
panel,
but
we--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
right,
certainly
prong
four
goes
far
beyond
jurisdiction.
but
what
makes
this
not
offend
judicial
integrity
is
that
territorial
residents
who
have
no
right
to
an
article
iii
compliant
tribunal
had
their
case
heard
by
three
federal
judges.
it
was
heard
fairly.
they
had
no
disqualifying
constitutional
due
process
biases.
they
rendered
a
unanimous
decision
on
overwhelming
evidence
in
the
face
of
highly
discretionary
challenges.
and
so...
and...
and
you
have
combined
with
that
what
justice
scalia
referred
to
in
discussing
with...
with
counsel
for
petitioner,
the...
the
counter-concern
that
there's
a
judicial
integrity
problem
with
allowing
people
to
proceed
before
a
court
and
then
wait
until
there's
an
adverse
outcome
to
challenge
who
it
was
that
rendered
that
decision.
and
so
taking
all
of
those
factors
together
in
the
particular,
peculiar
context
of
territorial
residents,
we
don't
think
this
offended
judicial
integrity
or
the
reputation
of
these
proceedings.
they
had
three
judges,
not
a
judge
and
a
layperson,
not
a
judge
and
a
child.
they
had
three
judges.
there
was
no
unconstitutional
bias.
there
was
full
consideration
of
their
arguments.
they
had
every
opportunity,
if
they
didn't
want
this
panel,
to
raise
an
objection,
but
they
didn't.
they
took
it.
they
went
with
the
judgment,
and
it's
now,
under
the
plain
error
doctrine,
i
think
too
late
in
the
day
to
object
to
the
composition
of
the
panel.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
justice
kennedy,
i
think
defense
counsel
are
frequently...
had
to...
have
to
make
difficult
decisions.
they
have
to
decide
whether
they
want
to
alienate
the
jury
by
objecting
to
evidence.
do
they
want
to
alienate
the
judge
by
seeming
too
obstreperous?
do
they
want
to
seem
like
they're
hiding
something
from
the
jury?
they
have
to
make
these
difficult
decisions,
but
the
whole
point
of
an
adversarial
system
is
that
defense
counsel
is
charged
with
doing
that
and
you
have
to
strike
balances.
and
if
on
balance
they
decided,
which
i
don't
think
counsel
should
think
about
their
own
reputation
in
defending
their
clients,
but
if
they
decided
it
would
be
better
not
to
make
the
panel
angry,
i'm
not
going
to
object,
that's
a
strategic
choice
that
they've
made.
but
at
the
same
time,
they
may
have
made
the
decision,
this
is
a
good
panel
for
us.
we
don't
know.
there's
nothing
inherently
prejudicial.
unlike
most
harmless
error
or
plain
errors
where
it's
inherently
prejudicial
to
a
defendant
to
admit
a
confession
or
suppress
evidence
about
the
circumstances
of
the
confession,
there's
nothing
inherently
prejudicial
ex
ante,
up
front
about
a
particular
judge
sitting.
and
so
there's
important--
