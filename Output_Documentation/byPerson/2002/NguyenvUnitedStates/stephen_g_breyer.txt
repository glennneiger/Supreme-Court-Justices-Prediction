justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
you...
you
have
a...
a
statutory
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
have
a
constitutional
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
let's
assume
away
the
statutory
argument
for
the
moment.
there
you
have
the
problem...
you're...
you're
right
that
it's
contrary
to
the
statute,
but
maybe
it
isn't
plain
error.
i'm
focusing
only
on
the
constitutional
argument,
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
constitutional
argument,
i
would
like
you
to
assume
the
statute
says
the
opposite.
the
statute
says
that
this
judge
can
sit.
so
purposes
of
a
constitutional
argument,
why
can't
your
party
waive...
why
can't
your
clients
have
waived
that?
my
particular
thought
is
that
we're
just
considering
a
case
in
which...
a
different
case
in
which
it's
at
least
arguable...
there
are
two
sides
to
the
argument...
whether
two
parties
can
get
together
and
have
a
magistrate,
who
is
not
an
article
iii
judge,
try
their
case.
the
consent
simply
consisting
of
the
fact
they
went
ahead
without
objection.
in
that
case,
there's
the
statute,
but
for
present
purposes,
we're
assuming
the
opposite
statute.
so
i
mean,
if
it's
at
least
arguable
that
you
could
have
consent,
shown
only
by
the
fact
they
went
ahead
to
a
trial
before
a
magistrate
and
that
would
be
enough
to
validate
constitutionally
the
magistrate
trying
the
case,
why
isn't
the
fact
that
you
went
ahead
here
constitutionally
sufficient
to
show
that
you
agreed
to
the
trial
before...
the...
the
appeal
that
included
one
judge
from
guam?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
understand
that,
but
my
question
is,
how
is
that
any
more
true
or
less
true
where
what
they've
done
is
consent
through
behavior
to
trial
of
a
case
before
a
magistrate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
that
magistrate
trials--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--through
consent
are
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
i
jumped
ahead
to...
thinking
what
you
were
going
to
say
before
listening
to
what
you
were
going
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
want
to
hear
what
you're
going
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
fault.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
are
you
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
we
agree
with
you
then,
if
we
agree
with
you
that
consent
through
behavior
is
not
good
enough
constitutionally,
we
would
also
be
saying
it
is
unconstitutional
to
have
consent
to
a
trial
before
a
magistrate.
you
see,
that's
quite
a...
a...
if
you're
going
to
say
yes
to
that,
that's
a
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
one
question
on
the
merits
i'd
like
to
ask
you.
let's
assume
we
get
to
the
merits
of
a
constitutional
question.
i
assume
for
that
purpose
that
the
statute
says,
the
ninth
circuit
shall
travel
to
guam
and
hear
appeals
and
for
purposes
of
this...
for
purposes
of
this
voyage
to
guam
to
hear
the
appeal,
the
make-up
of
the
panel
will
be
two
article
iii
judges
and
one
article
i
judge.
all
right?
that's
the
statute.
now,
why
is
that
unconstitutional?
i
cannot...
it's
very
unusual,
but
i
cannot
think
of
any
due
process
right
of
any
guam
person
who
would
be
hurt,
and
i
cannot
think
of...
why
it's
wrong
to
ask
an
article
iii
judge
to
take
on
this
additional
adjudicatory
function
with
an
article
i
judge
sitting
next
to
him.
it's
purely
adjudicatory.
it's
not
handing
out
radio
licenses.
it's
not
doing
anything
else
that's
unsuitable
to
a
judge.
why
not?
that's
the
merits
of
the
question,
and
i'm
not
saying
it
has
an
obvious
answer,
but
i
want
to
hear
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
appointments
clause
which
wasn't
even
raised
in
the
reply
brief.
i
mean,
that...
that's...
or
in
the
cert
petition.
is
that
all?
if
it's
not
the
appointments...
i'll
go
look
at
that.
sorry.
i
just
hadn't...
i
was...
i
was...
thought
you
were
going
to
say
something
about
the
structural
article
iii
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
say
why...
why
do
you
have
to...
the
ninth
circuit
is
an
article
iii
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
statute
says
that
for
purposes
of
hearing
an
appeal
from
guam,
two...
the
ninth
circuit
hears
it.
the
panel
shall
consist
of
two
article
iii
judges
and
one
article
i
judge.
okay?
now,
i
want
to
know
what
in
the
constitution
forbids
that
statute.
i'm
not
saying
it's
obvious
one
way
or
the
other.
i
want
to
know.
and
it
won't
help
just
to
say
it
forbids
it.
i
want
to
know
why
it
forbids
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
wait.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
the
interesting
case
under...
leave
plain
error
out.
i
mean,
you
may
be
right
on
the
plain
error.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
is,
i
think,
in
justice
stevens'
question
a
very
important
implication.
to
get
the
due
process
part
out
of
it,
assume
that
the
people
in
front
of
the
court
are
not
american
citizens.
indeed,
assume
it's
judge
wald
going
to
be
appointed
to
the
international
court.
now,
there's
no
due
process
problem.
so
can
the
congress
appoint
a
sitting
federal
judge
to
go
to
a
foreign
place
where
it's
perfectly
all
right
with
the
foreign
people
and
hear
their
case?
now,
i'm
not
sure.
but
that's,
i
think,
what
they're
arguing
is
at
issue
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
a
due
process
problem--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
a
question
of
what
kind
of
function
you
can
give
to
a
sitting
federal
judge
because,
after
all,
we
have
our
two
sitting
federal
judges
in
the
ninth
circuit.
they
went
out
to
guam,
in
principle.
they
constituted
themselves
a
different
sort
of
tribunal,
including
the
article
i
judge,
and
no
one
claims
that
was
unfair
to
anybody
in
guam.
so
there's
no
due
process
problem.
now,
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
same--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
clearly
is
no
due
process
problem.
i'm
mixed
up
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suddenly
we're
talking
about
waiver.
maybe
i
put
that
in
as
a...
it's
a
kind
of
red
herring.
it's
not
a
question
of
waiver.
it's
a
question
of
whether
this
is
plain
error
which
turns
into
a
question
of
does
it
seriously
affect
the
fairness,
integrity,
or
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
now,
i
take
it
in
all
these
hypotheticals
where
the
ninth
circuit
is
deliberately,
which
i
don't
think
they'd
do,
defying
a
congressional
statute,
getting
everybody
to
have
waivers
on
the
record,
which
are
totally
contrary
to
what
congress
said,
that
it
would
seriously
interfere
with
the
integrity.
but
in
a
case
where
nobody
even
thought
of
the
issue,
where
they
raised
it
a
lot
later,
it's
all
come
up
by
accident,
et
cetera,
and...
that
maybe
it
wouldn't
interfere
with
the
public
reputation.
so
what
has
waiver
to
do
with
it?
