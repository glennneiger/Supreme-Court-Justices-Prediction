mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
participation
of
a
non-article
iii
judge
on
an
improperly
constituted
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
renders
the
decision
of
that
panel
void.
the
parties
are
in
agreement
that
the
designation
of
judge
munson,
who
sits
for
a
10-year
term
on
the
ninth
circuit
panel,
violated
the
statute
pertaining
to
designations.
but
that
statute
does
more
work
than
simply
govern
designations.
that
statute
protects
the
article
iii
character
of
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
by
ensuring
that
only
article
iii
judges
are
designated
to
sit
on
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
yes.
a
properly
constituted
quorum...
or
a
quorum
of
a
properly
constituted
panel
could...
could
be
two
members.
but
our
objection
here,
justice
o'connor,
is
with
the
participation
of
a
judge
who,
with
all
due
respect,
had
no
business
being
there
in
the
first
place.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
even
though
the
panel
was
unanimous.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
no,
for...
for
two
reasons.
principally
because
the
rules
that
govern
quorum
call
for
a...
a
two-member
panel
rather
than
a
three-member
panel
when
there's
some
emergency
that's
certified
or
when
there's
a
disqualification
or
recusal.
so
i...
i
think
there--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--i
would
maintain
not
in
this
case
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
appears
that
there
has
been
some
participation
in
the
preparation
of
respondent's
brief
by
the
chief
judge,
as
well
as
judge
goodwin.
so
we
would
maintain,
given
that
involvement,
it
would
be
best
to
send
this
back
to
a
newly
constituted
and
properly
constituted--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--it
is
a
right
that
can
be
waived,
justice
o'connor.
there's...
there...
that's...
that
i
think
is
beyond
peradventure.
but
i
don't
think
there
was
waiver
here
because
there's
no
record
evidence
that
indicates
that
there
was
a
waiver.
this
court
in
new
york
v.
hill,
for
example,
found
a
waiver--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--well,
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--well,
the
additional
point
i
was
going
to
make
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question
is
that,
in
fact,
even
though
there
may
be
consent
or
even
though
there
may
be
waiver,
that
has
not
stopped
this
court
from
considering
these
important
structural
limitations
in
the
past.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
i
think
that
the
decision
is
void,
and
so
the
position...
the
position
would
be
that
although
all
article
iii
provisions
can
be
waived,
in
this
instance
because
of
the
nature
of
the
structural
error,
the
consent
or
the
waiver
would
not
matter
at
all.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
i...
i
think
that's...
that's
correct.
i
think
that
would
be
the
necessary
consequence.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
but,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
relies
upon
counsel
in
that
situation
being
confident
that
this
court
would
grant
a
writ
of
certiorari.
i...
i
think
that
that
kind
of
gamesmanship
is
really
quite
far-fetched.
this
court
does
not
sit
as
a
court
of
errors.
so
even
though
i
as
counsel
know
that
that
might
be
error
below,
i
would
still
have
to...
i
would
have
to
be
relying
on
the...
the
equivalent
of
legal
lightning
striking,
so
to
speak,
in
order
to...
to
be
certain
that
that
error
would
be
corrected.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
that
is
true
as
a
general
matter
at
the
trial
court
stage.
however,
it...
it's
very
much
our
position
here...
and
i
would
disagree
with
the
premise
only
insofar
as
you
said
as
to
the
court
of
appeals.
congress
vested
jurisdiction,
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.,
section
1291,
over
appeals
from
the
territories
in
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
no.
i...
when
congress
vests
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals,
it
does
so
not
only
to
its...
in
accordance
not
only
with
its
plenary
power
over
the
territories
under
article
iv,
but
also
pursuant
to
article
iii.
when
congress
creates
any
inferior
court
and
creates
a
jurisdiction
in
those
courts,
we
would
maintain
that...
that
congress
is
acting
pursuant
to
article
iii.
and
in
this
instance--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--it
was...
it
was
exercising
its
plenary
authority
pursuant
to
article
iv.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
that...
that's
exactly
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
that...
that's
correct.
even
if
congress
was
acting
under
article
iv,
the
statute
plainly
vests
jurisdiction,
and
it...
and
it
provides
for
independent...
independent
review
of
these
appeals
by
an
article
iii
court.
to...
to...
as
respondent
suggests,
to...
to
argue
that
a
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
could
be
specially
constituted
for
these
appeals
would
rewrite
section
1291.
section
1291
says
in
very
plain
terms
that
jurisdiction
shall
vest
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
in
the
following
senses,
justice
scalia,
it
did
affect
it.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
fairness,
the
ninth
circuit
is...
is
a
court
of
fully
independent
review,
and
i
would
maintain
that
precisely
because
the
petitioners
here
were
tried
by
an
article
iv
court,
it
makes
sense,
and
it
may
actually
be
constitutionally
required
that
in
some
sense
their...
their
appellate
review
is
had
by
an
article
iii
court.
but
in
any
event,
congress
statutorily
vested
jurisdiction
in
a
fully
independent
article
iii
court,
and
as
a
result
of
doing
so,
to
put
judge
munson
who
sits
for
a
10-year
term
on
a
panel
as
a
co-equal
participant
would
affect
the
fairness
of
the
court.
we
have
a
unique--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--i...
i
think
there
would
be
issues
of...
of
qualification
there,
and
there
might
even
be...
where
a...
a
recess
appointment
was...
was
held
in
a...
in
a
qualified
sense,
then
i
would
say
that
was
an
article
iii...
an
article
iii
qualification
for
an
article
iii
court
potentially.
if
there
were
issues
as
to
the
qualification,
we
might
be
in
the
realm
of
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
well--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--yes,
and...
and
i
would
add
to
my
response
to
justice
scalia
that
we
have
an
amicus
brief
here
from
judge
moore
who
sits
in
precisely
the
same
seat,
so
to
speak,
that
judge
munson
sits
as
a
territorial
judge
in
the
virgin
islands.
the
amicus
brief
of
judge
moore
points
out
very
plainly
that
he
views
himself
as
open
to
question
with
regard
to
his
impartiality
because
he
is
subject
to
the
hostile
treatment...
to
use
justice
douglas'
phraseology,
the
hostile
treatment
of
the
press
and
the...
and
the
glowering
disfavor
of
those
who
have
in
their
hands
the
power
of
reappointment.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
he
wants...
he...
he
prefers
that
you
convert
him
to
an
article
iii
judge,
so--
[laughter]
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
because
this
court
has...
has
said
that
the
claims
of
structural
validity,
claims
that
go
to
the
very
validity
of
the
tribunal
itself,
are
claims
which
invoke
institutional
interests,
not
just
personal
interests--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--well,
this
court
has
never...
this
court
has
never
addressed
the
question
of
whether
you
can
have--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--a
trial--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
i
do
that
sometimes
too.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
the
court
has...
the
court
has
never
before
held
that
it
would
be
permissible
for
a...
or
for
a
magistrate
to
conduct
a
full
trial.
and
that
i
would
maintain
because
that
also
might
affect
institutional
interests
could
also
not
be
subject
to
waiver
or
consent.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
that's...
that
argument
is
certainly--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--no,
i...
i
understand
that.
but
again,
i'm...
i'm
going
to
go
to
the
dividing
line
between
article
iii
interests
and
appointments
clause
interests
and
those
structural
limitations
and
structural
protections
in
the
court
system
which
are
not
quite
the
same
as
the
kind
of
structural
trial
errors
that
this
court
has
addressed
in...
in
gomez,
that
this
court
addressed
last
term
in
cotton.
those
really
are
errors
that
go
to
the
validity
of
the
claim,
not
necessarily
to
the
validity
of
the...
or
to
the
very
validity
of
the
institutional
interests.
i
think
the
hypothetical
that
you
posit
is
actually
glidden,
and
in
glidden,
this
court
held
that
even
where
the
designation
of
the
judges
from
the
court
of
claims
and
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
was
lawful
in
that
sense,
the
court
took
pains
to
look
and
see
whether
the
courts
from
which
those
judges
were
designated
were
article
iii
courts.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
no,
there
wasn't,
but
the
chief
justice
and
justice
clark
in
that
case
concurred
in
the
result,
and
the
difference
that
they
had
with
the
majority
was
that
they
didn't
think
that
bakelite
and
williams
should
be
deemed
overruled,
only
that
they
had
been
superseded
by
subsequent
events,
including
the
grant
of
lifetime
tenure
to
the
judges
on
the
court
of
claims
and
to
the...
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
no.
no,
they
did
not.
but
i...
i
would
maintain
that
there
was
a...
a
majority
of
five
on
a
seven-member
court
because
two
of
the
justices
had
recused
themselves.
a
majority
of
five.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
i
can't
answer
the
second
question.
to
be
frank,
i'd
like
to
know
the
answer
to
the
second
question
as
well.
but
as
to
the
first
question,
i
really
would
start
with
the
proposition
that
i
don't
think
it
matters.
i...
i
don't
think
it
matters
here.
the
conversation,
even
as
reported
by
respondents,
would
not
in...
in
my
mind
and
in
our
position
constitute
a
waiver
or
consent.
the
issue
of
who
hears
your
appeal
is
probably
so
important
that
it's
necessary
that
that
be
done
somehow
in
the
defendant's
presence.
respondent
relies
on
olano.
in
olano,
the
court
took
pains
to
point
out
that
the
defendants
were
present
when
the
discussions
of
whether
the...
the
alternate
jurors
could
deliberate
or
not.
here
i
would
say
this
is...
this
would
be
the
same
sort
of
issue
subject
to
the
same
sort
of
waiver
and
consent
requirements.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
i
think
for...
he
doesn't
have
to
be
there,
but
there
would
have
to
be
some
indication
on...
on
the
record,
in
addition
to
the
conversation
that...
that
respondents
recite,
that...
that
petitioner
nguyen
understood
that
there
was...
that...
that
she
was
waiving
some
important
right
to
a
fully
independent
review
by
an
article
iii
court.
and
i
want
to
stress,
as
i
say
that,
that...
that
this
claim
that
respondents
make
with
respect
to
waiver
and
consent
really
affects
only
one
of
the
petitioners
here.
we
have
to
continue
with
the...
with
the
case
of
petitioner
phan
for
whom
no
oral
argument
was
made.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
but
even
if
she
had
only
a
statutory
right
in
that
sense,
it's...
it
is
the
case
that
congress
creates
jurisdiction
and
creates
the
inferior
courts
pursuant
to
article
iii
under
a
statute.
that
doesn't
mean
that
constitutional
protections
and
constitutional
rights
don't
attend
the
statutory
grants
of
jurisdiction
and...
and
the
activities
of
the
courts
that
are
created
pursuant
to
article
iii.
there
are
numerous
examples
of...
of
pure
statutory
rights.
let's
take,
for
example,
the
right
to
appeal.
that
is
merely
a
statutory
right.
this
court
has
not
held
that
that's
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
that
is...
that
is
true.
but
here--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--that
is
true,
but
this
court
has
held
in
cases
that
involve
similar
article
iii
issues
and
similar
issues
of
the
appointments
clause
that...
that
issues
of
consent
and
waiver
are
not
dispositive.
a
fortiori
then,
i
think
issues
of
forfeiture
would
not
be
dispositive.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
i'm
going
to
give
almost
the
same
answer
that...
that
we
would
give
as
to...
as
to
our
claims.
it
violates
the
appointments
clause.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
well,
i'm
going...
i'm
going
to
there
as
well--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--and...
and
say
that...
that
if
the
judge
was
an
article
i
judge,
that...
if
that
judge
had
lifetime
tenure,
then
we
would
be
back
in
the
realm
of
glidden
again,
trying
to
decide
whether
that
court
was
actually
an
article
iii
court.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
it...
it
forbids
it
because
of
the
special
nature
of
article
iii
courts.
the
court
has
frequently
noted
that
article
iii
courts
are
independent.
they
have
constitutional
independence.
they
have
constitutional
salary
protection.
article
i
judges
are
not
independent
in
the
same
way.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
well,
we
said
in
our
brief
that
if
congress
were
acting
to...
in
accordance
with
its
plenary
power,
which...
as
i
think
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
poses,
that
might
well
be
constitutional.
i
think
there--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--i...
i
think
that
is
a
very
difficult
and
open
question,
and
i...
and
i
think
there
might
be
a
constitutional
issue
if
we
to
back
to
crowell
v.
benson,
and...
and
crowell's
reaffirmation
in...
in
northern...
or
rather,
thomas.
there
is
a
significant
issue
as
to
whether
you
can
have
territorial
judges
exercising
precisely
the
same
kind
of
almost
article
iii
jurisprudence
that
district...
regular
article
iii
district
judges
have
and...
and
not
have
some
sort
of
article
iii
review
from
that.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
i
think
that...
that
claim
can
be
made,
as
i
say,
on
the
basis
of
crowell
and...
and
on
the
basis
of
thomas.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
i
think...
i
think
i
would
make
it
and
i
think
i
would
make
it
for
the
following
reasons.
precisely
because,
as
justice
ginsburg
points
out,
these
article
iv
judges,
in
trying
cases
and
interpreting
federal
law,
are
certainly
doing
the
same
kinds
of
work,
exercising
the
judicial
power--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--well,
i...
there
is
certainly
article
iii
review.
i'm
not
sure
that...
that
article
iii
review
has
been
constitutionally
mandated
in
that
sense.
but
where
there
is
no
article
iii
protection
in
the
first
place
with
respect
to...
to
judges
who
are
exercising
that
authority
at
the
trial
court
level,
crowell
v.
benson
and
i
think
thomas
indicate
that...
that
there
is
a...
there
is
an
open
question
at
least
as
to
whether
article
iii
review
is
mandated.
and
this
court
said
the
same
in
guam
v.
olsen
on...
on
precisely
the
same
issue.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
this
case
was
not
decided
in
that
kind
of
narrow
context.
it
is
not
the
case
that
court
of
appeals
from...
or
decisions
of
the
court
of...
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
from
guam
or
the
northern
mariana
islands
are
narrow
decisions,
or
somehow
limited.
in
cruz
versus
the
united
states,
the
ninth
circuit
decided
a
question
about
the
transportation
of
firearms
in
interstate
commerce
and...
and
created
a
split
on
the
basis
of
a
guam
appeal
with
the
sixth
circuit.
judge
munson,
in
effect,
would
be
deciding
cases
that
would
apply
to
district
judges
in
montana.
i...
i
think
that
is,
in
part,
answer
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
about
the...
about
the
article
i
judge.
with
respect
to--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--i
think
actually
the
ninth
circuit
couldn't
do
that
because
of
its
article
iii
nature.
i...
i
think
that
would
be
a...
an
exceedingly
odd
thing
to
do
for
the--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--that's
true,
but
we
know
the
issue
of...
of
unpublished
decisions
is...
is
changing,
and
nonetheless
there
may
be
some
knowledge,
intra-circuit
knowledge,
about
how
these
issues
were
treated.
these
judges
are,
as
we
discussed
earlier,
interpreting
federal
law.
this
was
a
case
about
laws
that
arose
from...
from
18
u.s.c.--
and,
justice
souter,
i
would
point
out
that
with
respect
to
integrity
here,
i...
i
think
it
would
be...
it
would
have
more
integrity,
oddly
enough,
for
the
court
to
have
sat
with
the
director
of
tourism
of
guam.
now,
i
say
that
because
judge
moore
points
out
in
his
amicus
brief
that...
that
he
is
open
to
attack
on
the
ground
of
whether
he's
impartial
to
the
government.
and...
and
here
judge
munson
was
sitting
on
a
case
in
which
the
government
was
the
opposing
party.
i
would
add
too
that
this
is
the
kind
of
case
where
the
court
can...
can
articulate
a
high
wall,
a
bright
line
for
congress.
when
congress
vests
jurisdiction
in
an
article
iii
court,
that
means
article
iii
review.
that
decision
or
that
principle
is
implicit
in
glidden,
and
this
case
represents
the
missing
piece
of
that
puzzle.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
