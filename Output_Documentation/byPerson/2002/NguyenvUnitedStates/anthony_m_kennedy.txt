justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
surprised
you
say
that
there
can
be
a
waiver.
so
the
ninth
circuit
could
routinely
send
out
to
its
litigants
a
waiver
notice
waiving
participation
of
non-article
iii
personnel
and
there
would
be
no
structural
objection?
i...
i
thought--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
thought
the
whole
point
of...
of
your...
of
your
error
analysis
is
this
affects
the
structural
integrity
of
the
court
and
it
can't
be
waived.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
what...
what
is
your
position?
can
the
right
be
waived
or
not?
i
mean,
if...
if
you
say
the
right
can
be
waived,
then
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
or
not
they
knew
or
should
have
known
or
something
like
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that...
but
that
didn't...
that
was
not
a
court
which
in...
in
other
parts
of
its
duties
was
not
an
article
iii
court.
you're
saying
that
you
can
become
an...
be
an
article
iii
judge
one
day
and
article
iv
judge
the
other
day.
or
an
article
iii...
i
should
say
an
article
iii
court
one
day,
an
article
iv
court
the
next
day.
there's
simply
no
authority
for
that
proposition
that
i
know
of.
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
your
position
is
there...
there
could
be
a
waiver.
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
was
that
the
parties
could
waive.
suppose...
suppose
that
we
issued
this
decision
and...
and
your
position
prevails.
everybody
agrees
that
this
appointment
should
not
have
been
made.
what's
to
prevent
the
ninth
circuit
from
just
asking
the
parties
to
please
waive
their
rights
under
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
they
waive
that.
but
suppose
the
parties
waive
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that...
but
that...
you're...
you're...
there
are
two
questions.
one
is
can
an
article
iii
judge
go
to
another
court.
that's
not
this
case.
this
case
is
whether
a
non-article
iii
judge
can
go
to
an
article
iii
court
so
that
the
article
iii
court
is
on
some
days
an
article
iii
court
and
some
days
not
an
article
iii
court.
i...
i
assume
that
the
law
of
the
circuit
is
something
the
ninth...
ninth
circuit
is
proud
of.
is
it
going
to
now
have
under...
under
your
theory
an...
an
asterisk
by
the
opinions
that
are
written
by
non-article
iii
judges
so
that
that's
not
so
much
the
law
of
the
circuit?
i
mean,
this...
this
is
the
problem:
what
happens
to
the
court,
not
what
happens
to
the
judge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
congress
could...
could
authorize
a
state
superior
court
judge
to
sit
on
this
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
again,
mistretta
involved
the
assignment
of
a
judge
to
a
commission.
it
didn't
involve
the
delegation
of
duties
to
a
court.
and
that's
what
you're...
and
that's
what
you're
saying,
and
that's
quite
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
theory...
forget
the
supreme
court...
the
ninth
circuit
could,
if
it
was
authorized
by
congress,
have
a
visiting
state
court
judge
every
day
as
the
visitor
of
the
day.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
would
not
impair
its
article
iii
character.
i...
i
just
find
that
very
difficult
to
believe.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
it's...
i
think
it's
sometimes
not
unusual
for
us
to
put
a
hypothetical
case
to
test
your
proposition.
and
the
proposition
we
are
testing
is
whether
there
is
a
structural
deficiency
caused
by
a
territorial
judge
sitting,
either
by
accident
or
on
purpose,
if...
if
there's
such
a...
a
structural
impairment
of
its
constitutional
role,
of
its
constitutional
integrity
that
there
must
be
reversal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
agree
with
you
that
that's...
that
that's
a
hard
point
in...
in
the
case.
let
me
ask
you.
do
we
focus
just
on
the
rights
of
the...
of
the
litigant
in
this
case?
or
is
it
appropriate
for
us
to
consider
the
constitutional
integrity
of
an
article
iii
court?
in
other
words,
suppose
we
thought
there
was
damage
to
the
court,
not
necessarily
to
the
litigant.
can
we
take
account
of
that
in
the
plain
error--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
question
isn't--
--more
binding
than
the
one
we
have
here?
and...
and
justice
stevens'
question
is
important
because
this
case
has
consequence...
consequences
and
it
tells
congress
what
might
be
done.
congress
might
say,
well,
we
won't
put
this
burden
of
waiving
a
statutory
right.
we'll
take
away
the
statutory
right
and
say
that
article...
that...
that
article
iv
judges,
territorial
judges,
can
always
sit
on
ninth
circuit
opinions
involving
guam.
that's...
that's
why
we're
testing
whether
or
not
there's
a
structural
error
in
what
occurs
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought--
--but...
but
it
is
important
because
you're
saying
that
it's
just
a
statutory
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm...
and
i'm
suggesting
that
it
might
be
more
than
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
don't
usually
talk
about
a
statutory
violation
as
being
something
that's
immoral.
it's
just
a
violation
of
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
wrong
without
a
waiver.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
doesn't
decide
much
in
my
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
given
how
small
the
community
is,
the
bar
is,
in
guam
and
the
northern
marianas,
it
puts
counsel
in
a
somewhat
difficult
position
for
the
judge
to
say,
oh,
do
you
mind
if
i
sit
on
this
case
even
though
i'm
not
qualified.
so
i...
i'm
not
sure
the
waiver
was
all
that
voluntary.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
the
point.
