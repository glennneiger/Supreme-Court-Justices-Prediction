justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
government's
brief,
they
mention
a
conversation
with
the
chief
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit
by
a
former
lawyer
for
your
client.
i'm
curious
to
know,
a,
whether
you
disagree
with
what
is
said,
and
b,
how
did
they
get
in...
how
does
that
get
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
at
the
outset?
and
actually
two
questions.
some
years
ago
i
was
in
london,
and
i
was
asked
to
sit
with
a
british
court
on
the
bench.
and
i...
i
didn't
do
it,
but
i
often
thought,
well,
i
wonder
if
they
would
have
let
me
participate
in
the
decision.
supposing
here,
instead
of
the
article
i
judge,
you
had
a
british
judge
and
they
asked
him
to
sit.
that
would
be
one
question.
would
that
make
it
a
different
case?
and
secondly,
what
if
they
asked
the
president
of
the...
of
the
guam
bar
association
to
sit
as
a
third
person
on
the
panel?
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
the
same
statutory
violation
you
have
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
you
just
say
that's
harmless
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
plain
error.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
create
a
court
with
two
judges
and
a
british
judge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
assume
they
could
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
with
the
statute
we
have
now--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
--what
would
you
do
in
that
case
that
i
asked
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
perfectly
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
your
position,
as
i
understand,
is
this...
this
right
can
be
waived,
and
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
why...
supposing
we
decide
with
you
in
this
case,
why
next
month
the
ninth
circuit
might
go
back
and
ask
for
written
waivers
from
all
the
lawyers
in
guam
for...
to
repeat
the
process
and
put
on
the
president
of
the
bar
association
as
the
third
person
on
the
panel.
why
couldn't
they
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they're
complying
with
the
rule--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
there's...
if
there's
a...
a
waivable
right
there,
and
they
say
we
think
it's
in
the
interest
of
harmony
between
the
judges
and
lawyers
in
the
ninth
circuit
to
let
one
of
the
lawyers
sit
with
us
and
see
how
we
work
here
a
couple
of
times.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they're
going
to
do
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you've
already
admitted
it's
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why...
instead
of
getting
into
waiver,
why
don't
we
say,
under
the
plain
error
doctrine,
look,
everybody
agrees
that
it
was
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
the
waiver
would
be
stronger
if
it
were
in
advance
instead
of
afterwards.
i'm
positing
a
case
where
everybody
agrees
in
advance
we'll
let
the...
we'll
let
this
director
of
tourism
of
our...
of
guam
participate
as
a
judge
today
because
that
will
help
the
image
of
the
court
and
so
forth.
everybody
agrees
we'll
let
them
try
it.
why
isn't
that
waiver
more--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
also
have
the
opinion
to
announce
in
a
case
called
khanh
phuong
nguyen
and
tuyet
mai
thi
phan
against
the
united
states
has
come
to
us
from
the
island
of
guam.
this
also
is
a
case
from
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioners
were
tried,
convicted,
and
sentenced
to
lengthy
prison
terms
on
federal
narcotics
charges
in
the
district
court
of
guam.
they
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
panel
that
was
convened
to
decide
their
appeals
included
two
judges
of
the
ninth
circuit
who
are
life-renured
article
iii
judges
and
also
chief
judge
munson
of
the
district
court
for
the
northern
mariana
islands
who
sat
by
designation.
that
court
like
the
district
court
of
guam
is
not
an
article
iii
court
but
an
article
iv
territorial
court.
unlike
an
article
iii
judge
who
enjoys
life
tenure
and
may
remain
in
office
during
good
behavior,
a
judge
of
the
district
court
for
the
northern
mariana
islands
serves
for
a
term
of
ten
years
and
the
president
may
remove
him
from
office
for
a
good
cause.
before
argument
of
their
appeal,
petitioners
made
no
objects
to
chief
judge
munson’s
inclusion
on
the
ninth
circuit
panel.
after
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
their
convictions
and
sentences,
however,
petitioners
sought
writs
of
certiorari
presenting
the
question
whether
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
invalidated
because
of
chief
judge
munson’s
participation
in
the
consideration
and
decision
of
their
appeal.
we
granted
certiorari
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
we
vacate
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals.
section
292(a)
of
the
judicial
code
permits
the
chief
judge
of
a
circuit
to
assign
one
or
more
district
judges
within
the
circuit
to
sit
on
the
court
of
appeals
whenever
the
business
of
that
court
so
requires.
although,
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
court
for
the
northern
mariana
islands
is
literally
a
“district
judge”
of
a
court
within
the
ninth
circuit,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
his
designation
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
authorized
by
statute.
other
provisions
within
title
28
together
with
historical
usage
demonstrate
that
the
term
"district
judges"
as
used
in
section
292(a)
refers
only
to
those
judges
who
enjoy
the
protections
of
article
iii.
accordingly,
the
ninth
circuit
panel
that
included
chief
judge
munson
was
improperly
constituted.
in
our
view,
the
defect
in
chief
judge
munson’s
designation
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
merely
technical
but
rather
represented
a
breach
of
congress
decision
to
preserve
the
article
iii
character
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
presence
of
a
quorum
of
two
otherwise
qualified
judges
does
not
excuse
the
improper
panel
designation.
although,
the
quorum
statute
has
existed
for
over
a
century,
we
have
consistently
vacated
the
judgments
of
improperly
constituted
courts
of
appeals
despite
the
presence
of
a
quorum
of
competent
judges.
it
is
highly
doubtful
that
two
article
iii
judges
on
the
panel
below
and
any
authority
deserve
as
a
panel
by
themselves
when
the
court
was
not
properly
constituted
in
the
first
instance.
we,
therefore,
return
these
cases
to
the
ninth
circuit
for
a
fresh
consideration
before
a
properly
constituted
panel.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia,
justice
ginsburg,
and
justice
breyer
have
joined.
