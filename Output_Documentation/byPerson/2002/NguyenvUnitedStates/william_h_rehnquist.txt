we'll
hear
argument
first
in
number
01-10873,
khanh
phuong
nguyen
versus
the
united
states
and
a
companion
case.
mr.
green.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then...
then
your...
counsel
could
have
appeared
in
the
ninth
circuit
fully
aware
that
judge
munson
was
sitting,
go
all
the
way
through
the
argument
and
the
briefing,
never
mentioning
a
word
about
it,
and
still
the
counsel
would
have
the
ability
to
void
the
thing
later.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
justice
scalia's
question,
at
least
as
i
understood
it,
i
think
meant
for
you
to
concentrate
on
why...
why
this
would
bring
the
administration
of
justice
into
disrepute,
so
to
speak.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you
make
your
argument
that
this
was
improper,
what
was
done,
and
the
government
agrees.
but
there's
an
additional
requirement
here
under
plain
error.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
glidden...
really
there
was
no...
no
opinion
for
the
court
in
that
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they...
they
didn't
join
the
opinion,
did
they,
of
justice--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
green.
ms.
millett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in...
in
our
fulminante
case,
i
think
we
held
that
even
structural
error
was
subject
to
harmless
error
review,
that
it
was
not
simply
an
automatic
reversal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
mr.
green,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
green.
the
case
is
submitted.
