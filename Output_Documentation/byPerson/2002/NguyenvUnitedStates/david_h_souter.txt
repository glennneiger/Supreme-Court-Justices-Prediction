justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
assume
you've
got
a...
maybe
i'm
wrong,
but
i
assume
you've
got
a
fall-back
and
that
is,
okay,
if
you
don't
accept...
we
don't
accept
the
constitutional
position,
you're
still
claiming
that
you
have
a
legal
entitlement
to
the
ninth
circuit
and,
hence,
to
a
completely
article
iii
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
could
be
true
if
congress
was
acting
under...
under
article
iv.
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
that
if
congress
said,
all
right,
we're
going
to
have
appeals
from
the
territorial
courts
in
a
court
consisting
of
one
territorial
judge
and
two
article
iii
judges,
however
selected,
no
problem
with
that
constitutionally.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you...
you
would...
you
would
have
the
same
problem
if
congress
said
we're
going
to
set
up
an
article
iv
court
of
appeals
consisting
of
three
article
iv
judges.
you'd
have
the
same
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
claim
can
be
made,
but
i
mean,
would
you
make
it?
do
you
think
that
is
a
sound
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
could
make
the
same
argument
about
trial
judges
and...
and
article
iii
district
judges.
they're
doing
the
same
kind
of
work.
they're
subject
to
the
same
pressures
and
the
same
concerns,
and
if
it's
okay
for
the
district
court,
why
wouldn't
it
be
okay
for
an
appellate
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
hypothetical
is
just
simply
designed
to...
to
illustrate
the
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
if
it's--
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
it's
wrong
only
if
you
cannot
waive
it.
in
the...
the
hypothetical
is
that...
that
the
waiver
is
right
up
front,
that
the
person
says
it
would
be
wrong
without
the
waiver,
but
i
waive.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the...
the
question
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--excuse
me.
but
i
think
the
question
was
why
will
this
not...
this
practice
not
be
perpetuated
if
it
is
waivable.
it
is
not
an
answer
to
that
to
say
that...
the
other
courts
will
not
gratuitously
engage
in
unconstitutional
action
because,
if
the
waiver
is
effective,
there's
no
unconstitutional
action.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
on
your
position
you
have
to
face
the
fact
that
if
it's
waivable,
it
can
properly
happen
again
if
there's
a
waiver.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
let
me...
let
me--
justice
david
h.
souter
--hear
that
with...
with
what
my
follow-up
question
was
going
to
be.
and
you
can
answer
them
both.
justice
david
h.
souter
everybody
agrees
that
it
was
plain.
and
there
is,
in
fact,
a
serious
question
about
the
integrity
of
the
court
when
the
composition
of
the
court
is
simply
illegal.
and
so,
if
you
want
to
stick
to
waiver,
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
is
to
justice
stevens'
problem.
the...
the
alternative
to
waiver
is
to
face
the
fact
that
there's
something
seriously
wrong
with
a
court
which
is
unabashedly
illegally
constituted.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
ms....
ms.
millett,
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
i
mean,
you
have
said...
and...
and
i
understand
what
you're
getting
at.
that
does
not
make
this
no
longer
a
court.
but
in...
in
a
way
that
sort
of
begs
the
question
because
the
one
thing
that
is
plain
is
that
this
so-called
court
is
not
the
court
that
the
statute
calls
for.
so
far
as
the
statutory
definition
of
the
appropriate
court
to
hear
this
appeal,
this
court
is
illegally
constituted.
and
don't
we...
even
if
we
confine
our
concern
to
this
one
instance,
don't
we
have
a
reason
to
find
that
that
fact
does
go
to
the
integrity
of
the
proceeding
for
the
purposes
of
the
plain
error
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
quorum
assumes
that
you've
lost
one
who
was
also
an
appropriately
constituted
member
of
the
court.
and
you
haven't,
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mm-hmm.
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
long
as
it...
but...
but
if...
if
power
to
act
is
the
criterion,
then
your
answer
would
have
to
be
the
same
if
the
director
of
tourism
had
been
substituted
in
this
case
because
the
power
of
the
ninth
circuit
would
be
there
to
act,
a
quorum
of
article
iii
judges
would
be
sitting,
and...
and
so
i
take
it
your
answer
would
have
to
be
the
same.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
thought
your
answer
to
the
plain
error
question
of
integrity
was
essentially
an
answer
that
relied
heavily
on
jurisdiction.
and
the
jurisdictional
answer
was,
this
is
the
ninth
circuit.
it
has
power
to
act.
there's
a
quorum
of
ninth
circuit
judges.
and
that
would
be
the...
that
would
be
the
same
if
the
third
member
were
not
an
article
iv
judge
but
had
been
the
director
of
tourism.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
i
agree--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but...
which
is
simply
to
say
there
are
other
concerns
than
the
jurisdictional
concern.
