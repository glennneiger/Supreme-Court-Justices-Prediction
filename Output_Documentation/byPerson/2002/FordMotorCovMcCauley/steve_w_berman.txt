mr.
steve
w.
berman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
turn
to
the
question
that's
taken
the
balance
of
the
argument
so
far
and
that
is
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
and
i
do
so
with
the
same
reluctance
that
mr.
waxman
did
because
the
underlying
question
is
an
important
question
that
has
troubled
courts
dealing
with
class
actions
for
some
time
now.
but
despite
the
fact
that
i'd
like
the
court
to
answer
that
question,
i
don't
think
there
was
jurisdiction
on
appeal
or...
or
before
this
court
because
it's
quite
clear
that
no
matter
how
you
artfully
look
at
this,
this
is
a
simple
situation
that's
subject
to
1407(c)
and
(d)
which
this
court
has
said
commands...
and
that's
in
the
grauded
case...
unmistakably
commands
that
where
there
is
a
remand,
based
on
the
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
that
that's
not
reviewable.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
no
one
moved
to
dismiss
that
complaint.
the
court,
after
consideration
of
class
certification,
wrestling
with...
i
think
with
the
laws
of
the
various
different
states
that
were
invoked
by
that
motion,
said
to
us,
i'm
issuing
an
order
to
show
cause
why
i
shouldn't,
on
my
own
motion,
dismiss
this
case
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
and
then
we
briefed
that
issue
and
the
judge
dismissed
the
case
in
response
to
the
briefing
on
the
order
to
show
cause.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
justice
ginsburg,
that
was...
the
answer
is
yes.
it
was
before.
we
were
in
the
midst
of
the
class
certification
hearings.
we
had
two
or
three
hearings.
no
class
had
been
certified,
and
i
think,
as
i
said
earlier,
that
in
the
process
of
wrestling
with
the
various
state
laws,
the
district
court
scratched
his
head
and
said,
why
is
this
case
before
me?
mr.
steve
w.
berman
i
think
you
are
understanding
his
argument
correctly,
but
i
submit
that
he's
incorrect.
it's
not
a
new
case.
as
one
of
the
justices
pointed
out,
there's
no
authority
under
the
mdl
rules
for
us
to
just
say
this
is
a
whole
new
case.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
i
did,
your
honor,
and
if
you
read
judge--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--that's
correct.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
it
is
not
uncommon
in
mdl
practice
for
pretrial
purposes
to
try
to
organize
the
pleadings
for
the
district
judge
in
a
consolidated
complaint.
in
fact,
i...
i
can't
think
of
any
mdl
case
i
handle--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--well,
there
were
some
representative
changes
because
after
all
the
lawyers
across
the
country
got
together
for
the
first
time,
because
we
were
thrown
together,
some
of
those
lawyers
said,
if
you're
going
to
move
for
class
certification
of
a
nationwide
class
in
one
of
these
state
court
cases,
maybe
my
representative
doesn't
need
to
be
there
because
there's
five
other
representatives.
so
for
consolidation
purposes
and
for
organizational
purposes,
we
streamline
and
we
try
to
be
as
organized
as
we
can.
that
doesn't
mean
we've
abandoned
the
cases
underlying
below.
we...
we
did
not.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
well,
there's
a
federal
case
for
pretrial
purposes,
and
the
judge,
judge
dwyer
of
the
lower
court,
found
he
had
no
jurisdiction
anymore
over
that
case
which
is
proceeding
in
federal
court.
but
it's
a
diversity
case
asserting
state
law
claims.
so
it's
not,
quote,
a
federal
case.
it's
been
removed,
and
once
a
court
determines
that
there's
no
jurisdiction,
it's
no
longer
a
federal
case.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
well,
to
answer
that,
justice
ginsburg,
the
pretrial
order
that
mr.
waxman
cited
to
and
i
think
that
you
cited
to
as
well
said
that
the
consolidated
complaint
was
to
be
filed
for
pretrial
purposes
only.
there
was
no
waiver
in
the
record
that
we
filed.
the
judge
didn't
order
that
we
submit
such
a
waiver.
and
i
don't
know
that
i
have
the
authority
as
a
lawyer
to
alter
the
mdl
rules.
the
mdl
rules
don't
provide
that
i
can
decide
on
my
own
that
the
case
will
proceed
for
all
purposes
forever
in
front
of
judge
dwyer.
and...
and
yes,
the
complaint--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--it's
in
the--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--no,
it
does
not,
your
honor,
and
the
judge
didn't
mandate
that
we
do
it.
he
said,
should
you.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
yes,
you
did.
and
there's...
there's
nothing
in
this
record
other
than
the
complaint.
if
you
read
from
the
complaint
consent,
that's
the
only
thing
in
the
record
that
you
could
draw
that
we
consented
to
judge
dwyer
trying
this
case
for
all
purposes.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
i
base
that
on
my
understanding
of
mdl
practice.
i
mean,
we
didn't
say
we're
filing
this
for
trial
purposes.
we
didn't
say
we're
filing
it
for
pretrial
purposes.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
in
mdl
practice,
i
submit,
justice
scalia,
that
you
do
file
a
complaint
of
some
form
that
brings
all
these
plaintiffs
from
all
over
the
country
together.
i
can't
think
of
an...
an
mdl
case,
whether
it
brand
name
prescription
drugs
or
the
various
cases
that
are
pending
involving
the
pharmaceutical
industry,
for
example,
where
a
consolidated
complaint
of...
of
removed
state
court
cases
is
not
put
together
in
some
fashion.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
i
think
it
is
very
typical--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--i
could
submit
my
supplemental
record--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--it
never
got
there
because--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--that...
the
order
of
remand,
both
by
the
district
judge
and
the
ninth
circuit,
was
stayed.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
actually
i
think
the
language
of
the
order
is
that
the
cases
are
remanded
back
to
the
state
courts.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
yes.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
that's
correct.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
that's
correct.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
yes,
you
can.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
if
you...
if
you
took
jurisdiction
under
that
scenario--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--in
all
due
respect,
you
would
be
violating
both
the
spirit
and
the
intent--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--of
1407.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--there
was...
there
was
an
erroneous
order
of
the
district
court.
and...
and
i
submit
that--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--that's
correct.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
that
is...
that
is
not
what
he
meant.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
and
the
problem
i
have,
justice
breyer,
is
that
i
would
like
to
agree
with
your
argument
because,
as
you
pointed
out,
this
is
something
that's
plaguing
the
courts.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
well,
i
would
like
the
court
to
review
the
underlying
merits,
but
to
do
so,
i
think
you
have
to
do
some
gamesmanship
and
do
injustice
to
1407.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
that
was
disposed
of.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
and
i
understand
that,
justice
kennedy,
but
the
case
that
mr.
waxman
cites
and
the
cases
he
cites
for
the
proposition
that
an
aggrieved
party
can
appeal,
i
don't
quarrel
with
that.
the
problem
with
that
authority
in
this
case
is
that
none
of
those
cases
that
he
cites
are
cases
where
there's
been
a
dismissal,
which
there
was
in
this
case,
of
the
consolidated
complaint
on
the
grounds
of
a
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--i...
i
agree
with
that.
it
would
go
to
the
district
courts
pursuant
to
proper
mdl
practice.
we
would
move
for
enforcement
of
the
judge's
order
remanding
the
case,
but
we
couldn't
fight
that
issue
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
it
would
have
been
decided--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--that's
correct.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
and...
and
because
of
that--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--no.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
it
just
surfaced
today.
and...
and
the
jurisdictional
issue
just
surfaced
in
response
to
your
question.
no
one
raised
the
1407
issue
in
any
of
the
courts
below.
i
had
originally
had
come
to
talk
about
the
important
issue.
[laughter]
and
i...
i
don't
know
that
mr.--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--mr.
waxman
hasn't
had
time
to
address
that
issue.
i
don't
know
if
the
court
wants
me
to
go
into
that.
i
have
some
time
remaining.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
very
briefly
then.
this
court
has,
since
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
was
passed,
consistently
construed
diversity
jurisdiction
so
as
to
avoid
expanding
the
federal
caseload.
that's
the
teaching
of
snyder
v.
harris.
the
proposition
that's
asserted
here
today
by
the
petitioners
that
you
can
use
administrative
costs
in
satisfying
the
amount
in
controversy
would
vastly
expand
the
federal
caseload
in
two
ways.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
mr.
chief
justice,
my
answer
to
that
is
i
think
that
the
court
could
adopt
a
rule
allowing
the
amount
in
controversy
to
be
determined
from
either
viewpoint,
both
from
the
plaintiffs'
viewpoint
or
from
the
defendants'
viewpoint.
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question.
the...
the
question
really
presented
then
is
how
do
we
value
that
amount.
and
this
court's
teachings
i
think
have
answered
that
question,
and
that
is
in
the
hunt
case,
the
court
has
ruled
and
has
consistently
followed
this
proposition,
that
it
is
well
established
that
the
amount
in
controversy
is
measured
by
the
value
of
the
object
of
the
litigation.
and
so,
another
way
the
court
has
put
it
is
what
right
does
the
plaintiff
seek
to
have
enforced
here.
the--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--i...
i
think
the
court
has
never
squarely
been
faced
with
the
issue
of
should
the
plaintiff's
rule
be
adopted
or
not.
there
is
suggestions
that
it
should
be,
but
i
think
what
the
court
has
been
consistent
on
is
looking
at
the
value
of
the
object
of
litigation
from
the
point
of
view,
what
is
it
that
the
plaintiff
wants,
not
what
are
the
incidental
costs
to
the
defendant.
in
fact,
there
is
a
case...
and
i...
i
know
it's
an
old
case,
but
the
ross
case
and
the
elliott
case
squarely
hold
that
jurisdiction
does
not
depend
upon
any
contingent
injuries
or
damage
to
a
defendant
in
a
case.
and
if
the
rule
is
otherwise...
and
by
the
way,
i
think
there's
a
big
difference,
for
the
purposes
of
this
court's
review,
of
an
administrative
cost
versus
injunctive
relief.
so
let
me
first
focus
on
administrative
cost.
the
mischief,
i
think,
of
allowing
administrative
cost
to
be
considered
is
illustrated
by
an
earlier
ninth
circuit
decision
in
snow
v.
ford.
and
there
the
plaintiff
sought
an
injunction
because
ford
had
sold
a
trailer
package
without
an
$11
wiring
kit.
and
ford
argued
then,
as
it
does
now,
that
because
it
would
have
to
incur
substantial
costs
in
supplying
this
$11
kit,
that
there
was
federal
jurisdiction.
well,
the
value
of
the
object
of
litigation
from
the
plaintiffs'
point
of
view,
if
you
can't
aggregate,
which
under
snyder
v.
harris
you
can't,
is
$11.
if
the
court
is
going
to
allow
administrative
cost
to
be
considered,
then
this
court
is
going
to
have
hundreds...
federal
courts
are
going
to
have
hundreds
of
$11
cases
in
front
of
them.
and
i
think
judge
posner
hit
the
nail
right
on
the
head
in
the
brand
name
prescription
drug
case,
in
which
he
said
that
if
the
costs
of
compliance
were
considered,
then
every
case,
virtually
every
case,
quote,
however
trivial
would
cross
the
threshold.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
because
consistently
this
court
has
looked
at
the
value
of
the
right
to
be
protected
and
excluded
such
incidental
costs.
the
value
of
the
right
there--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--well,
i
do...
i
do--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--well,
then
you'd
have
to
overrule
snyder
and
the
non-aggregation--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--yes,
which...
which
they're
not
advocating.
but
from
a
policy
argument,
my
argument
is
that
you
would
suddenly
thrust
the
federal
courts
in
determination
of
what
basically
are
state...
routine
state
law
matters.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
that's
correct.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
that's
correct.
that...
it's
$2
million,
the
new
proposed
limit,
and
it
would
allow
aggregation,
which
this
court
so
far
has
not
allowed.
so
congress
realizes
under
existing
precedent
that
what
the...
ford
wants
to
do
here
is
not
permitted.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
that's
their
argument,
and
i
don't
think
it
counts
against
my
position
for
two
reasons.
in
order
to
make
that
argument,
what
they're
really
doing
is
aggregating
what
it
would
cost
to
reinstitute
the
system
as
if
they
were
going
to
pay
all
6
million
class--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--no,
because
right
now
there
are
just
six
plaintiffs.
this
is
not
a
class.
and
those
six
plaintiffs
may
have
a
total
of
$20,000
at
stake.
all
ford
has
to
do
to
satisfy
their
claim
in
this
case
is
to
give
those
six
people
the
rebates.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
and
the
only
way
to
get
around
that
is
to
aggregate
this
case,
which
they
can't
do.
and
so
the
danger--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--there
is
as
to
each
plaintiff.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
that's
right,
because
what
we
have
here
and
the--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--that's
right,
because
prior
to
this
litigation...
this
gets
to
the
common
and
undivided
interest.
prior
to
this
litigation,
these
plaintiffs,
these
6
million
people,
were
completely
unrelated.
they
had
no
common
interest
in
this
issue,
and
therefore,
you
can't
follow...
you
can't
aggregate.
they
have
to
be
treated--
mr.
steve
w.
berman
--no,
because
under
the
analysis
of...
of
this
court
and
the
gilman
court
in
the
second
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit,
again
because
each
person
had
a
separate
right,
as
they've
admitted.
they've
admitted
that
for
damage
purposes
each
person
had
a
separate
and
distinct
claim.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
it
is.
if...
if
i...
if
one
of
my
plaintiffs
decides
he
no
longer
wants
to
be
in
this
litigation,
they
have
don't
have
to
up
the
specific
performance
to
someone
else.
each
person
only
has
the
right
to
the
rebates
they
were
entitled
to.
so
they're
separate
and
distinct
no
matter
what
the
relief
is.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
no.
they...
they
were
removed
before
anything
happened.
mr.
steve
w.
berman
that's
correct.
you
have
an...
you
have
an
uncertified
class
here.
the
other
danger
i'll
touch
on
in
my
last
minute
of
allowing
the
injunctive...
amount
it
would
cost
the
defendant,
either
by
way
of
injunction
or
administrative
cost,
is
that
plaintiffs
could
use
this
new
theory
to
invoke
federal
court
jurisdiction.
the
amicus
seem
to
suggest
that
plaintiffs
never
want
to
be
in
federal
court.
that's
not
correct.
if
you
adopt
the
petitioners'
rule,
anytime
i
have
a
case
where
i
want
to
be
in
federal
court,
where
i
normally
could
not
be
in
federal
court...
and
i
have
many
such
cases
right
now...
i
would
just
simply
have
to
say
in
my
prayer
for
relief
that
the...
the
injunction
would
cost
the
defendant
more
than
$75,000.
and
bingo,
i
have
a
whole
new
rule
and
there's
a
whole
new
group
of
federal
cases
that
suddenly
would
arise.
so
in
closing,
unless
there's
any
questions,
the
problem
with
the
defendants'...
the
petitioners'
position
in
this
case
is
that
it
would
open
up
the
flood
gates
of
litigation
to
the
federal
court
system.
we
cited
a
rand
institute
study
that
about
65
percent
of
the
country's
class
actions
are
in
state
courts,
and
to
adopt
their
rule
would
mean
that
many
of
those,
probably
thousands
of
cases,
that
are
now
residing
in
state
courts
would
suddenly
find
their
way
into
federal
courts.
that
i
think
is
not
consistent
with
this
court's
policy
of
strictly
construing
the
diversity
statute
and
giving
deference
to
state
courts
and
state
governments
with
respect
to
laws
that
they
have
the
power
to
enact
and
to
have
those
cases
heard
in
state
courts.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
