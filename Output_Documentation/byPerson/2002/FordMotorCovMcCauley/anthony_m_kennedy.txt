justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
as
i
understand
mr.
waxman's
position,
it
is
that
the
consolidated
complaint
is
a
new
federal
action.
to
be
sure,
the
effect
of
the
district
court's
order
being
appealed
here
and
being
reversed
may
affect...
may
control
the
remand
of
the
cases
that
were
being
held.
but
this
action
must
be
looked
at
on
its
own
as
a
federal
action.
true,
one
of
the
proximate
causes
of
our
retaining
the
action
by
saying
that
there
is
jurisdiction
may
defer
the
remand
of
those
other
cases.
true,
that
looks
like
something
of
an
end
around
the
no
appealability
for
remand,
which
is
the
express
command
of
the
congress.
but
we
have
here
a
separate
case
and
we
have
to
look
just
at
that
separate
case.
number
one,
am
i
understanding
his
argument
correctly?
and
number
two,
what
is
your
response?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
a
question
of
abandonment.
it's
a
question
of
which
one
takes
precedence.
there's
now
a
federal
case
which
mr.
waxman's
argument
is
takes
precedent.
we
just
hold
everything
else
until
this
one
is
done.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--justice
breyer
told
you
that...
said
that
it
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
state
courts.
but
the
question
is
what
is
the
it.
you
have
to
first
dispose
of
the
action
that
was
instituted
by
the
consolidated
complaint.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
the
only
thing
we're
arguing
about
here,
and
the
arg...
and
the
contention
is
it
was
improperly
disposed
of
and
that
it
was
disposed
of
on
a
basis
that
injures
the
defendants
and
that
they
can
appeal
that
because
they're
aggrieved
under
the
cases
that
mr.
waxman
cites.
and
that's
all
we're
talking
about.
