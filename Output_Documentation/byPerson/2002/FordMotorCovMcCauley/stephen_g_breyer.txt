justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
you
have
a
brand
new--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
true,
but
does
it
normally...
is
it
normally
just
look
like
an
ord...
your
complaint
looks
like
an
ordinary
complaint.
it
names
four
people.
it
says
we're
bringing
a
case.
it's
diversity
jurisdiction.
it's
quite
clear,
i
think,
there's
venue.
and...
and
that's
it.
it
looks
like
a
normal
complaint.
so
is
it
ordinary
mdl
practice
that
what
happens
when
you
transfer
things
for
pretrial
proceedings,
the
lawyers
get
together
and
file
what
to
the
naked
eye
looks
exactly
like
a
normal
complaint,
as
if
they
marched
into
federal
court
on
day
one
and
filed
a
complaint?
is
that
normal
mdl
practice?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
i
verify
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
not
your...
i
mean,
is
there
some...
i
guess
i
could
look
it
up
in
a
book
on
mdl
practice.
now,
on
mdl
practice,
when
you
finish,
as
i
read
the
rules,
it
says
the
transferee
judge
can
reach
a
judgment.
but
if
he
doesn't
get
to
a
judgment
that
finishes
the
case,
he's
supposed
to
send
it
back
to
the
transferor
districts,
not
the
state
court,
but
back
to
several
transferor
districts.
is
that
what
happened
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
was
the
order
of
remand
the...
an
order
to
send
it
back
not
to
the
states
but
to
the
federal
transferor
districts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
the
state
courts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
must
be
wrong,
mustn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
should
go
to
the
transferor
districts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
also...
it
says
specifically
and
that
is
pursuant
to
the
mdl
order,
which
we
can
review,
can
we
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
we
would
have
the
power
in
this
case
to
review
what
should
have
been
the
ninth
circuit's
order
remanding
the
case
to
the
transferor
districts,
even
though
they
said
it
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
at
all.
after
all--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--not
at
all.
not
at
all.
if,
after
all,
an
order
of
the
mdl
panel
were
to
have
an
underlying
theory
that
there
wasn't
jurisdiction
in
some
court
or
other
under
1447,
i
don't
see
why
we
couldn't
by
writ,
as
provided,
review
it.
and
our
reason
for
doing
it
would
be
to
solve
an
important
and
serious
problem
of
jurisdiction
that
is
plaguing
the
lower
courts.
in
other
words--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
did
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
there
is
an
order
dismissing.
there
is
an
order
that
says
remand
it
to
the
courts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
the
state
courts.
but
that...
that
isn't
what
they
meant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
that
is
a
problem.
i
see
that
as
a
problem,
but
i
don't
know
if
it's
an
insuperable
problem--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
the
way
it
would
have
worked
if
they
had
gotten...
hadn't
said
remand
to
state
courts,
is
they
would
have
sent
it
back
to
transferor
districts.
some
transferor
districts
would
have
agreed
with
this
judge,
some
would
have
come
to
other
conclusions,
and
we
plainly
could
have
reviewed
the
ones
that
came
to
other
conclusions
so
we
could
have
decided
the
issue.
so
is
that
what
you
think
should
happen?
what
should
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
shouldn't
they
have
it
if
in
fact
it
really
does
cost
the
defendant
the
$75,000,
however
you
categorize
it?
why
shouldn't
the
federal
courts
hear
those
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
might
be
a
legal
argument
there,
but
i
thought
you
were
making
a
policy
argument
that
it
was
a
bad
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
don't
see
why
that's
so
if
in
fact
in
most
cases
i
think
that
if
it's
going
to
cost
$75,000
for
an
$11
claim,
if
it's
really
just
one
claim,
the
defendant
will
settle
it.
and,
of
course,
if
it's
not
really
just
one
claim,
but
really
involves
class
actions
involving
many
hundreds
of
claims,
that's
just
what's
supposed
to
be
in
the
federal
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
a
legal...
you're
making
a
purely
legal
argument
then.
