scalia
what's
sort
of
unusual,
though,
is
that
you
didn't
suffer
the
dismissal.
i
mean,
yes,
a
dismissal
is...
is
usually
a
final...
a
final
action,
and
it's
usually
the
person
whose
suit
was
dismissed
who
appeals--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not...
not
the
person
who
benefitted
by
the
dismissal
and
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
say
that?
for
pretrial
purposes
only.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
judge
says
on
page
41,
should
plaintiffs
in
all
or
some
actions
decide
to
file
a
consolidated
complaint,
that
complaint
shall
be
filed
within
15
days.
and
then
the
complaint
itself
doesn't
say
it's
for
pretrial
purposes
only.
justice
antonin
scalia
could...
could
you
come
back
to
my
question?
where...
you...
you
say
that
the
complaint
was
only
filed
for
pretrial
purposes.
on...
on
what
do
you
base
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
filed
a
complaint.
i
mean,
you
file
a
complaint--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
berman,
you
don't
want
us
to
review
an
order
that
never
existed,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
want
us
to...
to
review
an
order
that
should
have
issued
but
didn't
issue.
how
could
we
review
an
order
that
never
issued?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
we
can
review...
the...
the
erroneous
order
is
nonreviewable.
justice
antonin
scalia
us
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't...
they
don't
need
that
for
their
relief.
and
wouldn't
that
be
a
frivolous
complaint?
wouldn't
that
be
conferring
jurisdiction
by...
by
making
an
assertion
that
goes
way
beyond
what
anybody
would
consider
reasonable?
