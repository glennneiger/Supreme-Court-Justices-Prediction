justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
a
defendant
who
removes
a
case
and
then
is
remanded
is
surely
aggrieved
but,
nonetheless,
cannot
appeal.
and
the
problem
i
have
with
an
answer
that
you
went
by
too
fast
for
me
is
this
case
is
in...
was
in
the
washington
district
court
for
pretrial
purposes
only
under
1407.
the
transfer
from
the
several
district
courts
to
which
these
cases
were
initially
removed...
that
transfer
under
the
statute
was
for
pretrial
purposes
only,
not
for
trial.
and
after
the
pretrial,
under
the
statute,
the
cases,
unless
all
the
parties
consent,
would
go
back
to
the
district
courts
from
whence
they
came.
so
i
don't
understand
how
the
western
district
which
is
dealing
with
a
complaint
for
pretrial
purposes
only...
i
mean,
the...
the
request
that
a
complaint...
consolidated
complaint
be
filed
was
for
pretrial
processing.
how
do
you
get
from
that
an
action
that
displaces
all
of
the
other
actions
that
had
been
removed
from
the
state
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
may
i
stop
you
at
that
point?
because
the
pretrial
consolidated...
the
order...
this
is...
i'm
looking
at
the
appendix,
page
35.
it
says,
by
order
of
the
multi-district
panel,
the
cases
have
been
consolidated
for
pretrial
purposes
only.
now,
you're
saying
that
there
is
something...
something
that
i
don't
see
in
the
written
orders
that
says
they...
no,
it's
going
to
be
now
for
trial
purposes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
things
like
that,
juris...
basic
jurisdictional
thing,
agreeing...
this
would
be
a
consent
to
have
a
court
that
has
no
authority
to
adjudicate
a
case
to
adjudicate
it.
usually
such
a
major
step
is
done
not
by
inference,
not
by
implication.
this
is
saying,
court,
even
though
you
have
no
authority
under
the
federal
statutes
to
proceed
without
our
consent,
we
are
consenting,
so
go
ahead.
we're
waiving
any
questions
of
venue
or
anything
else.
the
fact
that
this
is
labeled
consolidated
complaint
is
simply
what
the
multi-district
statute
says.
it
says
that
the
actions
may
be
transferred
for
consolidated
pretrial
proceedings.
so
why
couldn't
this
consolidated
complaint
be
simply
for
pretrial
proceedings,
the
only
thing
that
the
multi-district
panel
transferred
the
case
to
western
district
of
washington
for?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
i
think
the
problem
is
those
six
state
court
actions
that
haven't
vanished.
nobody
ever
dismissed
them.
and
as
aggrieved
as
you
are...
and
i
agree
that
you're
aggrieved...
you
could
not
appeal
from
the
remand.
it
seems
to
me
these
two,
the
dismissal
of
the
consolidated
complaint,
the
return
of
the
actions
from
which
this
consolidation
originated,
that
those
two
are
inextricably
tied
together.
and
you
would
like
to
cut
them
off
and
say,
court,
just
look
at
the
consolidated
complaint.
forgot
about
those
separate
actions.
somehow
they
vanished.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
order
of
the
western
district
of
washington
was
that
the
state
cases
are
remanded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
touch
that,
that
the
ninth
circuit
dealt
only
with
the
consolidated
complaint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
give
me
an
example
of
any
case
in
which
a
defendant
in
a
product
liability
suit,
in
a
credit
suit
like
this
one,
a
defendant
has
said
i
want
to
preempt
the
class
action
and
so
i
am
going
to
bring
this
declaratory
suit
against
all
the
credit
card
holders
of
this
plan
all
over
america
in
the
forum
that
i
choose,
and
that's
going
to
be
where
the
class
action
is
going
to
proceed.
can
you
give
me
any
precedent
for
a
defendant
being
able
to
take
over
what
would
have
ordinarily
been
the
plaintiff's
product
liability
claim,
credit
card
claim?
i...
i
don't
know
of
any
such
case
where
a
defendant
has
been
allowed
to
make
such
a
case
its
show
rather
than
the
plaintiff's
show.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
you
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because,
mr.
waxman,
you
have
potential
plaintiffs
from
all
over
the
country.
normally
a
lawsuit
is
begun
by
a
plaintiff
and
the
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum
is
respected.
here
you
are
saying
a
defendant,
not
dealing
with
one
plaintiff,
but
dealing
with
hundreds,
maybe
thousands...
i
don't
know
how
many
credit
card
holders
there
are...
across
the
country
can
start
the
lawsuit
and
a
federal
court
would
listen
to
that,
would,
at
the
defendant's
urging,
somehow
certify
the
plaintiff
class.
i
don't
know
of
any
such
action.
i
don't
know
of
any
district
judge
who
has
done
that
at
the
urging
of
a
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
in
any
case
you
said
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
doesn't
occur
to
you
that
there
is
such
a
case,
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--where
defendant
starts
the
action
as
a
declaratory
action
and
a
class
gets
certified
on
the
plaintiff's
side.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
all
ask
for
compensation.
there
are
none
of
them
that
ask
just
for
specific
performance,
and...
and
even
in
this
consolidated
complaint,
the
first
thing
that
they
ask
for
is
compensatory
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
before
there
was
any
certification.
you
didn't
get
up
to
any
certification
of
any
class,
did
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
berman,
mr.
waxman
points
out
that
you
have
submitted
an
entire
complaint.
it
doesn't
look
like
a
pretrial-only
complaint.
it's
a...
it's
a
complete
complaint
that
has
a
prayer
for
relief.
so
it
looks
like
a
different
action.
and
he
said
by
filing
such
a
complaint,
you
in
effect
waived
any
objection
to
the...
to
the
multi-district
forum
going
on
to
dispose
of
the
whole
case,
not
just
pretrial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't,
mr.
berman,
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
berman,
i
think
something
needs
clarification
here.
when
a
district
judge
in
a
multi-district
case
like
this
makes
a
pretrial
order,
determination,
decision,
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
those
cases
go
back
to
the
district
courts
from
whence
they
came,
that
ruling
is
not
up
for
grabs
in
the
individual
district
courts.
that
is
the
law
of
the
case
that
they
all
must
follow.
and
as
i
understand
the
western
district
of
washington
decision,
that
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
that
would
not
be
open
for
contest
in
the
district
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
what...
that's
what
this
class
action
fairness
act,
which
has
considerable
support,
that's
pending
in
congress...
it's
still
pending,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
it
would
do.
it
would
allow...
if...
if
the
price
tag
of
all
these
small
claims
for
the
defendant
was
more
than
the
amount
in
controversy...
well,
i
think
it
puts
a
much
higher
price
tag
than
$75,000.
but
anyway,
that...
that's
the
idea
of
the
class
action
bill
that's
pending
in
congress,
to
put
all
these
cases,
to
aggregate
them
if
the
total
dollar
amount
for
the
defendant
is
very
high.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
were
these
class
actions...
were
these
actions
certified
as
class
actions
in
the
state
court
before
they
were
removed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
have...
you
need
the
aggregation
of
the
class
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why...
mr....
mr.
waxman,
if
you...
if
the
test
is
one
plaintiff...
if
it's
judge
posner's
test,
you
assume
there's
one
plaintiff,
what
will
it
cost
the
defendant.
injunctive
relief
for
one
plaintiff
would
only
involve
tracking
that
particular
plaintiff's
purchases,
and
that
wouldn't
add
up
to
$75,000.
