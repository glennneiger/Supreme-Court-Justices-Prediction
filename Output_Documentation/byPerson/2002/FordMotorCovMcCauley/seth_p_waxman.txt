mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
perhaps
with
that
observation,
i
would...
it
would
behoove
me
to
address
the
quest...
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court
first,
as
much
as
i
would
like
to
rush
into
why
there
clearly
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
regardless
of
whether
the
plaintiffs'
claims
for
injunctive
relief
are
viewed
as
separate
and
distinct
or
common
and
then
divide
it.
so
let
me
first
address
why
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
and
this
court
had
appellate
jurisdiction,
and
it
is
straightforward.
that
is,
there
is
an
appeal
in
this
case
from
the
dismissal
with
prejudice
of
a
consolidated
complaint
which
was
filed
voluntarily
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
seeking...
as
against
plaintiffs
that
are
different
than
any...
than
the
constituent
state
court
actions,
including
different
plaintiffs
seeking
different
causes
of
action
and
seeking
a
different
form
of
relief,
that
is,
specific
performance
of
the
ford
rebate
program.
and
it
is
very
clear,
both
from
the
cont...
the...
the
four
corners
of
the
consolidated
complaint
and
from
an
express
representation
that
my
friend,
mr.
berman,
made
at
the
oral
argument
in
the
class
certification
stage,
that
the
consolidated
complaint
was
filed
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining,
in
front
of
judge
dwyer
in
the
northern
dis...
the
western
district
of
washington,
a
judgment
on
the
merits
in
the
case.
that
is,
it
was
different
than
the
treatment,
the
maximum
treatment,
that
he
would
have
been
permitted
to
provide
under
the
multi-district
litigation
panel's
reference.
that
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--indeed,
and
that,
justice
scalia,
is
the...
is
the
question
i
believe,
the
specific
question,
that
the
court
directed
the
parties'
attention
to
in
its
request
for
supplemental
briefs.
now,
it
is
clear
that
a
prevailing
party
normally
cannot
appeal,
but
the
operative
word
that
this
court
has
recognized,
at
least
since
the
electrical
fittings
case,
is
normally.
and
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
have
applied
a
rather
particular
test
to
determine
when
normally
doesn't
apply,
and
that
is,
is
the
nominally
prevailing
party
sufficiently
aggrieved
by
a
decision
in
its
favor
that
it
retains
a,
quote,
stake
in
the
appeal?
and
that's...
that
test
was
articulated
by
this
court
in
guaranty
trust
v.
roper--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
in
forney
v.
apfel.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
ginsburg,
the
appealability
of
the
dismissal
with
prejudice
of
the
consolidated
complaint
does
not
depend
on
whether
the
consolidated
complaint,
quote,
did
away
with
the
other
actions.
the
reason...
we
would,
of
course,
readily
concede
that
under
1447(d),
if
all
that
had
happened
was
a
removal
of
the
six
state
court
actions,
a
transfer
for
pretrial
purposes
to
a
multi-district
litigation
court
and
a
determination
by
that
court
that
it
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
complaints,
there
would
be
no
appeal
because
the
remand
of
removed
state
court
actions
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
congress
has
decided,
is
not
a
determination
that
may
be
reviewed
by
federal
appellate
courts.
but
here...
and
this,
i
think,
is
the
salient
point.
here,
the
judge
did
not
require
the
plaintiffs'
lawyers
in
the
six
cases
to
file
some
sort
of
concordance
or
a
consolidating
document
that
often
is
ordered
so
as
to
facilitate
pretrial
proceedings.
what
the
judge
said
is
if
anybody
wants
to
file
a
consolidated
complaint,
they
may.
the
consolidated
complaint
that
was
filed
in
this
case
avowedly
invoked
this
court's
13...
the
federal
court's
1332
jurisdiction
and
sought
not
just
pretrial
consolidated
proceedings
on
discovery
and
motions,
they
wanted
a
full
trial
or
a
full
resolution
on
the
merits.
in
other
words,
it's...
it's
as
if
the
judge,
having
had
the
six
cases
transferred,
said
expressly,
look,
i'm
going
to
deal
with
all
of
the
pretrial
matters
that
are
the
subject
of
this
transfer
order,
but
if
you
all
like
me--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no,
no.
i'm...
i'm
not
explaining
myself
correctly.
the...
the
order
doesn't
say
these
six
removed
cases
are
here
for
trial
purposes,
and
if
it
did,
it
would
exceed
the
court's
authority
under
1407
and
this
court's
specific
holding
in
lexecon.
on
page
41
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
court
under
a
heading
say...
entitled
consolidated
complaint
says,
should
plaintiffs
in
all
or
some
of
the
consolidated
actions
decide
to
file
a
consolidated
complaint,
you
have
to
do
so
within
a
certain
period
of
time.
now,
that
raises
the
question,
since
they
did
it
voluntarily,
whether
what
they
were
filing
was
something
that,
in
essence,
sort
to...
as
i
said,
to
be
a
concordance,
to
consolidate
in
one
document
all
of
the
various
parties
and
all
the
various
claims
and
all
various
theories
so
that
a
court
can
meaningful
and...
meaningfully
and
efficiency...
efficiently
manage
the
pretrial
proceedings.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that...
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
although
there
are
instances
where
the
court...
where
the
transferee
court
has
ordered
the
filing
of
something
called
a
consolidated
complaint.
but
here,
there
are
two
salient...
at
least
two
salient
differences.
one
is
this
complaint
has
different
parties.
it
has
different
causes
of
action.
it
seeks
a
different
type
of
relief.
and
at
the
motion...
and...
and
it
seeks
quite
clearly,
based
on
the
conduct
of
the
parties
and
the
representations,
this
is,
in
essence,
saying
thank
you
very
much
for
having...
having
us
here
for
consolidated
proceedings
on
our
underlying
state
court
actions,
but
we
have
decided
we
like
you,
judge
dwyer,
and
we
want
you
to
try
a
case,
and
we're
going
to
file
a
brand
new
federal
action
that
is
docketed
in
the
western
district.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
ginsburg,
it
certainly
could
have
been,
and
if
it
were
ordered
by
the
court,
that
is
the
most
that
it
could
have
been.
but
in
this
case,
that's
not
what
it
was.
there
are
parties,
claims,
and
requests
for
relief,
and
particularly
the...
what
is
really
the
object
of
the
litigation,
the
request
for
specific
performance
of
the
ford
rebate
program--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that...
i
think
your
premise...
the
premise
of
your
question,
justice
stevens,
with
respect,
is
incorrect,
which
is
if
we
had
asked
for
a
dismissal
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction
grounds
and
prevailed...
that
is,
we
would
have--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
we
had
asked
for
it,
then
we
would
have
gotten
all
that
we
could
possibly
have
expected.
what
we
asked
for...
what
happened
in
this
case
was
they
voluntarily
filed
it.
they
asked
for
trial
and
judgment
on
the
merits.
the
court
sua
sponte
said,
i
don't
think
i
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
we
have
the
right
to
appeal
that
because
we
are
sufficiently
aggrieved
that
we
have
a
stake
in
the
case.
and
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
because
of
the
amount
in
controversy.
it
refused
to
apply...
it
followed
prior
ninth
circuit
precedent
and
refused
to
apply
the
defendants'
viewpoint
in
a
class
action
seeking
injunctive--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
would
have
been
aggrieved
in
the
same
way...
because
what
we
sought
was...
what
we
wanted
was
litigation
in
a
single
forum,
in
a
forum
which
had
already
conducted
substantial
pretrial
proceedings
and
a
federal
forum.
we
sought
judgment
in
our
favor
on
the
merits.
what
we...
which
would
have
produced
a
dismissal
or
a
judgment
with
prejudice.
what
we
received,
but
did
not
ask
for,
was
a
result
that
permits
the...
either
these
plaintiffs
or
anybody
else
in
the
country
to
continue
this
litigation
in
state
court.
and...
and
their...
the
lower
courts
in
the
cases
that
we've
cited
are--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think,
this
court's
decision
in
forney
v.
apfel
stands
for
that
proposition.
but
it
would...
this
is
an
easier
case
because
we
did
not
seek
to
dismiss
this
for
subject
matter
jurisdiction
grounds.
we
wanted
to
be
in
federal
court.
we
were
the
ones
who
removed
the
underlying
state
court
actions
here.
as
it
turns
out,
they
decided
they
wanted
to
be
in
federal
court
too.
but
there
are
a
long
line
of
cases,
and
really
an
uninterrupted
line
of
cases,
in
the
lower
courts
that
have
interpreted
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
forney
and
guaranty
trust
and
electrical
fittings
to
mean
that
where
there
is
a
dismissal
on...
of
state
law
claims,
not
on
the
merits,
but
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
defendants
are
aggrieved
in
a
practical
sense.
and
we've
discussed
a--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--not...
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
maybe
i...
perhaps
i'm
not
understanding
you.
i...
there's
an
interesting
epistemological
question
in
this
case
whether
the
underlying
state
court
actions
continue
to
exist
or
whether
they
had
been,
in
fact,
superseded
but
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--you
mean--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
with
respect,
justice
souter,
if...
there
are
plaintiffs
in
two
of
the
state
cases
who
are
not
even
named
plaintiffs
in
the
federal
case.
there
are
defendants.
there
is
a
defendant.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the...
all
of
the
cases
seek
a
nationwide
class.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
are...
i'll
go
to
door
number
two.
there
are
claims.
there
are
causes
of
action
in
the
underlying
state
cases
that
are
not
included
in
the
consolidated
complaint
and
vice
versa.
in
short,
the...
the...
from
a
case
management
perspective,
whether
both
a
federal
case
and
a
state
case
that
are
both
in
existence
can
go
forward
simultaneously
or
whether
one
should
follow
the
other
is
something
that
happens
all
the
time,
and
it
has
never
been
understood
to
divest
one
court
or
the
other
of
jurisdiction.
and
our
submission
here
is
that
we
have
something
that
is
distinctly
new.
it
was--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
in
point
of
fact,
justice
souter,
if
this
court
reverses
the
ninth
circuit
for
the...
for...
for
one
of
the
two
errors
of
law
that
it
committed,
and
on
remand,
the
conclusion
is
made
that
there
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
the
case
can
proceed,
we
will
be
in
precisely
the
same
posture
that
we
were
in
at
the
time
that
the
plaintiffs
filed
the
consolidated
complaint.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and...
well,
the
state
cases
have
not
yet
been
remanded,
but
if
the
state--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
had
been
removed.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
they
will
remain
removed
if
this...
if
a
federal
court
concludes
that
there
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there
is
a
single
order
in
the
case
that
says
there
is
no
jurisdiction.
and
it's
in
the...
in
the
joint
appendix.
there
is
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
consolidated
complaint
or
over
the
six
removed
actions.
and
therefore,
the
consolidated
complaint
is
dismissed,
and
the
clerk
is
directed
to
remand
the
underlying
state
actions
back
to
the
states.
now,
that
order
was
stayed
by
the
ninth
circuit
at
our
request
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
that
is,
if--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
after...
yes,
it
was
stayed
prior
to
argument
there
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
would
have
except
that
we
moved
for
a
stay
of
the
mandate.
the
mandate
issued
before
the
court
ruled
on
it,
and
the
court
then
recalled
the
mandate
and
directed
that
the
remand
of
the
underlying
state
actions
not
proceed
until
this
court...
at
least
until
this
court...
has
resolved
the
question.
but
ultimately--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--not
true,
justice
souter,
for
two
reasons.
i'll
give
the
broader
one
first.
if
we
had
filed
as
all
parties
in
the
case
and
the
solicitor
general
as
well
agree
is
the
complete
functional
equivalent
of
the
consolidated
complaint...
if
ford
and
citi
had
filed
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
federal
court,
even
after
the
state
cases
had
been
filed,
before
or
after
they
had
been
removed,
and
we
asked
for
a
declaration
that
we
can
terminate
the
ford
rebate
program,
there
would
be
no
question
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
as
i'm
standing
here,
justice
ginsburg,
i...
i
can't
bring
any
cases
to
mind.
i'll...
i'll...
i'll...
i'll
try
and
bring
one
to
mind
prior
to
my
rebuttal.
but
i
don't
understand
what
the
objection
would
be
if,
before
terminating
the
program,
we
said,
we're
going
to
terminate
this
program--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
we
want
a
declaration
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
if
we
were
to
have
filed
such
a
case...
and
my
submission
is
it
would
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
consolidated
complaint...
it
would
not
disempower
plaintiffs
or
plaintiffs'
representatives
from
filing
their
own
class
actions
in
state
or
federal
court.
and
if
that
were
the
case,
there
would
then...
there
would
be...
thereafter
be
a
determination
made
by
the
courts
involved--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--as
to
whether
it
makes
sense--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
am...
i
am
sure
that
there
are
many
such
cases.
i
can't
cite
you
one
as
i'm
standing
here.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
correct.
i...
i
know
that
our
brief
and
the
red
brief
and
the
solicitor's
general
brief
all
address
this
scenario,
but
i
can't
bring
to
mind
the
cases.
but
just
to
get
back
to
justice
souter's
question
again,
let
me
give
you
the
ex...
in
terms
of
whether,
if
we
proceed
here,
a
state
case
could
go
forward
and...
and
would
go
forward,
if
you
take,
for
example,
the
alabama
case
where
there's
no
alabama
plaintiff
here,
they
have
not
only
not
sought
specific
performance,
they
have
disavowed
any
specific
performance
and
brought
separate
claims
on
different
theories.
since
they
haven't
sought
specific
performance,
there
is
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
claim
because
we
are...
and
this
court
basing
subject
matter
jurisdiction
on
the
cost
of
providing
that
performance...
the
alabama
case
can
and
presumably
will
go
forward.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
under
this...
yes.
under
this
court's...
under
the
court's
current
jurisprudence,
yes,
we
would.
the
only...
it
would
only
be
if
this
court
were
to
resolve
the
question
it
left
open
in
free
v.
abbott
labs
that
we
would
then
have
some
argument,
or
that
the
court
determined
that
punitive
damages
could
be
accumulated.
but
since
they
aren't
asking
for
a
specific
performance...
and
neither,
by
the
way,
are
i
think
four
other
of
the
six
cases.
since
they're
not
asking
for
a
specific
performance,
we
don't
have
an
argument
under
this
court's
existing
case
law
for
keeping
the
cases
there.
and
they
could--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
i
don't
know
that
i
have
the...
all
of
the
details
of
the
underlying
cases
in
mind.
but
if
they
are
simply
a
claim
for
damages
and
punitive
damages
in
which
the
amount
in
controversy
is
not
$75,000,
and
they
aren't
asking
for
specific
performance,
i
don't
think,
consistent
with
the
law
of
this
case,
we
would
have
any
basis
for
objecting
to
them
going
forward.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
it's...
it
is
clear,
justice
ginsburg...
and
if
it
isn't
clear
from
the
complaint,
it
is
utterly
clear
from
the...
from
the
plaintiffs'
red
brief
in
this
case
at
page
45
that
what
they...
the
object
of
this
litigation
is
reinstatement
of
the
national
ford
credit
rebate
program
under
which
they
can
earn
credits
toward
the
purchase
of
a
ford
vehicle.
they...
they're...
they
don't...
none
of
these
plaintiffs
have
a
liquidated
claim
for
damages
because
they're
not
asking
that
they
be
paid
rebates
that
they
earned
and
weren't
paid.
those
were
credited
to
them.
they
are
all
asking
for
reinstatement
of
a
program,
which
doesn't
exist,
that
will
allow
them
to
earn
credits,
based
on
purchases,
toward
the
purchase
of
a
vehicle.
and
on
the...
on
the
question
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
court
below
made
two
errors
of
law.
first,
it
held
incorrectly
that
class
actions
joining
separate
and
distinct
claims
for
injunctive
relief
cannot
be
viewed
from
the
defendants'...
cannot
be
valued
from
the
defendants'
viewpoint.
and
secondly,
it
erred
in
concluding
that
the
plaintiffs'
interest
in
specific
performance
cannot
be
viewed
as
common
and
undivided.
and
if
the
court
has
no
questions
at
this
time,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
and
perhaps
address
the
merits
on
rebuttal.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'll
use
1
minute
on
appellate
jurisdiction
and
i
hope
2
minutes
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
on
appellate
jurisdiction,
there
is
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
what
was
intended
here
was
a
new
complaint
about
new
things
to
proceed
to
judgment
at
trial.
at
page
11
of
the
transcript
of
oral
argument
before
the
district
judge
on
the
class
certification
issue,
the
court
says,
"if
a
nationwide
class
were
to
be
certified.
"
--he's
talking
about
the
consolidated
complaint...
"would
there
be
any
need
for
further
mdl
proceedings,
or
would
the
whole
litigation
just
be
there
in
this
one
case
for
trial
or
other
disposition?
"
"mr.
berman:
that
is
my
understanding.
"
"there
would
be
no
further...
everyone
has
consented.
"
"all
the
plaintiffs'
counsel
and
defendants
have
consented
to
have
this
case
here.
"
justice
ginsburg,
in
response
to
your
question
about
cases
in
which
a
declaratory
judgment
action
was
filed
where
it...
the
case
could
have
been
litigated
by
a
plaintiff
class
in
a
consumer
case,
that
was
the
case
in
the
greenwood
trust
case
filed
by
a
bank
in
the
first
circuit
that
ultimately
produced
this
court's
decision
in
smiley
which
was
a
consumer
class
action
that
came
up
out
of
california.
now,
with
respect
to
specific
performance,
specific
performance
is
the
object
of
this
complaint.
it
is
what
they
want.
it
is
the
thing
they
need
in
order
for
any
of
them
to
be
able
to
realize
the
benefits.
and
as
this
court
said
in
mississippi
&
missouri
river
bridge
v.
ward...
in
that
case,
it
involved
removing
a
bridge
obstruction...
the
removal
of
the
obstruction
is
the
matter
of
the
controversy
and
the
value
of
the
object
must
govern.
the
complaint
itself
says
they
want
specific
performance
of
the
national
rebate
program,
and
if
there
were
any
clarification
needed,
you
look
at
page
45
of
the
red
brief
and
they
explain
that
that's
just
what
they
want.
if
there
were
any--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's...
it
would
not
if...
the
court
may
or
may
not
grant
specific
performance
of
the
national
program
in
response
to
a
particular
plaintiff,
but
it
would
certainly
not
be
a
frivolous
claim.
cases
like
that
are
brought
all
the
time.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
ginsburg,
first,
the
cost
is...
the
test
is
the
cost
of
supplying
the
relief
requested
in
the
complaint
to
any
one
plaintiff,
and
that
is
class-wide
relief.
it
would
also
cost
a
sufficient
amount
even
if
it
were
only
one
plaintiff.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
