mr.
waxman,
can
i
interrupt
you
with
a
question?
it
seems
to
me
you're,
in
effect,
arguing
that
the
federal
consolidated
complaint
was
kind
of
a
brand
new
lawsuit,
and
we
forget
about
everything
else
that
happened
before.
now,
if
that
were
the
case
and
you
just
had
that
complaint
filed
against
you
and
you
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
you
prevailed
and
they
dismissed
the
complaint,
it
clearly
would
not
be
appealable.
in
order
for
you
to
find
reasons
to
appeal,
you
got
to
go
back
and
say,
well,
now
we're
going
to
have
to
face
a
lot
of
other
lawsuits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
they
asked
for
dismissal
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
i'm
sorry.
you're
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
would
not
have
been
aggrieved...
if...
if
that
was
the
only
case
pending
and
so...
and
if
it
was
dismissed,
how
would
you
have
been
aggrieved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you...
do
you
argue
that
in
just
an
ordinary
case
if
a...
you
file...
a
defendant
files
a
motion
to
dismiss
both
on
the
grounds
of
no
cause
of
action
and
so
forth
and
so
on
and
also
no
jurisdiction,
you
win
on
no
jurisdiction,
you
can
appeal
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
ask?
mr.
waxman
pointed
out
to
us
that
this
order
was
actually
stayed
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i
don't
find
the
stay
order
in
the
appendix.
i'm
sure
it's
in
the
record,
as
he
points
out.
but
in
connection
with
getting
that
stay
and
the...
the
both...
in
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
did
anyone
point
out
to
either
of
those
courts
that
the
order
was
defective
for...
for
failing
to...
to
include
the
transferor
court
rather
than
going
direct
to
the
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
just
surfaced
today.
