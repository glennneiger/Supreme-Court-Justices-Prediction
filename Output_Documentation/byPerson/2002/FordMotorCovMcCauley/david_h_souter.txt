justice
david
h.
souter
let...
let
me
ask
you
about
one
solution
to
the
epistemological
question.
let's
assume...
let's
assume
that
on
the
remand
the
state
courts
think
they
are
still
alive.
are
you
going
to
the
state
courts,
let's
try
them
now?
hear
us
immediately.
we
want
a
trial.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
not
going
to
do
that.
what
you're
going
to
say
is,
defer
any
action
here,
if
you
win
on
this...
on
your
point
here.
you're
going
to
say,
defer
any
action
so
we
can
try
the
federal
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
that
it
seems
to
me,
unless
i
am
missing
the
point
of
what
you
are
necessarily
going
to
do,
it
follows
that...
that
the...
that
the
federal
case
is,
in
fact,
simply
the
alter
ego
of
the
state
cases,
and
if
you
win
here,
you
are
functionally
doing
nothing
but
eliminating
subsection
(d).
justice
david
h.
souter
are
they
within
the
class?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
and
don't
you
think
those
non-named
plaintiffs
would
be
happy
to
let
somebody
else
carry
the
ball
for
them
in...
in
the
federal
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
they're...
they're
not
going
to
fight
you
when
you
say
to
the
state
courts,
just
let
them
sit
here
until
we
get
the
federal
case
taken
care
of.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
you...
but
our
point
is
if
functionally
you
are
going
to
treat
this
as
the
alt...
the
equivalent,
the
alternative
to
all
of
these
state
actions...
and
you
have
told
me
nothing
to
suggest
that
you're
not
going
to
do
that...
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
the...
the
argument
has
got
to
prevail
that
functionally
this
in...
in
fact
is
nothing
but
an
end
run
around
the
non-appealability
of
the
remand.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
because
at
that
time
the...
the...
the
state
cases
had
been
remanded.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
mean...
i'm
sorry.
they
had
been...
they
had
been
removed.
i
misspoke.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
had
been
removed.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
still
think...
i
still
think
you're
in
trouble
because
even
if
we
accept
your...
your
reading
of
what
the...
the
court
ordered
and
what
it's
likely
to
do
if
you
prevail
here,
it
simply
changes
the
characterization
of
what's
going
on.
you're...
you're
saying
that
the...
that
if
the...
if
the
consolidated
case
stays
in
the
federal
court,
it
does
not
die,
and
in
fact,
because
of
that,
there
is
no
remand.
then
it
simply
follows
that
the
consolidated
course
is
a
trump
to
the
remand
and
you're
excluding
the
operation
of
subsection
(d)
in
a
slightly
different
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
will
it
go
forward
without
your
objection?
are
you
representing
that...
that
you
will
walk
into
the
alabama
court
and
say,
sure,
we're
ready
to
go
ahead?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
many...
how
many...
i'm
sorry,
but
how
many
other
cases
like
the
alabama
case
are
there?
in
other
words,
you...
you
say,
okay,
we'll
litigate
in
alabama.
any
others?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so...
so
that
if
that
had
happened...
going
back
to
an
answer
you
gave
earlier,
if
that
had
happened,
and...
and
the...
the
missing
step
had
been
included
and
it
said,
back
to
the
transferor
court,
the
only
thing
that
could
have
happened
with
the
transferor
court,
the
jurisdictional
issue
having
been
decided
in
the
western
district
of
washington,
would
be
to
remand.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is...
is...
is
there
a...
is
there
a
distinction
to
be
made
along
these
lines?
and
i...
i
may
not
be
able
to...
to
state
what
i'm
trying
to
work
out
in
my
mind,
but
here...
here's...
here's
the
distinction
i'm
trying
to...
to
get
at.
let's
assume
that
the...
that
the
only
issue
is...
is
an
issue
in
one
case.
they
didn't
give
the
$11
taillight
or
whatever
it
was.
and
because
of
the
bureaucracy
of
a
big
company,
in
order
to
provide
the
one
$11
tail
light,
it's
going
to
cost
$100,000
to
galvanize
everybody
into
action
and
get
the
tail
light.
i
see
your
argument
in
that
case.
there's
a
difference,
though,
in
this
case
because
what
they're
saying
in
this
case
is
they
promised
that
they
would
have
a
kind
of
administrative
system
in
place
that
would
take
account
of
all
these
various
credit
charge
card...
credit
card
charges
and...
and
would...
would
ultimately
result
in...
in
this...
this
credit
of
up
to
$3,500
for
our
benefit.
the
various
people
who
are
aggrieved
by
their
failure
to
do
it
aren't
all
claiming
$3,500.
you
know,
they
may
be
claiming
everything
from
$5
to
$3,500.
the
only
way
to
satisfy
our...
our...
the
claims
of
all
these
people
who
are
in
the
class
is
to
put
the
system
in
place.
if
that's
the
essence
of
their
claim,
they're
not
saying
we
want
you
to
incur
a
lot
of
administrative
costs
in
order
to
get
to
a
particular
result,
which
is
jurisdictionally
insufficient.
they're
saying,
we
want
you
to
put
the
system
in
the
place...
in
place
that
you
agreed
you
would
do.
the
system
is
not
an
administrative
cost.
it's
what
you
promised
in
the
first
place.
the
system
is
the
tail
light.
is
that
a
fair
distinction,
and
does...
does
that
count
against
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
system
is
not
an
aggregated
system.
there's
either
a
system
or
there
isn't
a
system.
if
there
is
a
system,
it
produces
different
results
depending
on
the
kind
of
business
that
individuals
do.
but
the
system
is
not
a
separate
system
for
all
of
the
members
of
the
class
which
is
being
aggregated.
it's
a
system
to
fulfill
one
promise
which
was
made
in
common
form
to
the
entire
class.
and
isn't
that
a
distinction
which
removes
it
from
this
notion
simply
of
administrative
cost?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
is...
there
is
no
claim
for
specific
performance?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
as
to
a
class.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
they...
so
they
could
multiply
3,500
by
6
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
philosophical
question.
mr.
waxman
got
into
epistemology
a
minute
ago.
let
me
ask
you
a
contrary-to-fact
question.
if
in
fact
the
federal
action
were
a
class
action
and
it
included
everybody
who
had
been
included
in
the
state
class
actions
and
specific
performance
had
been
requested
in
the
form
that
i
suggested,
would
that
not
take
it
out
of
the
aggregation
problem
and...
and...
and...
and
satisfy
the
jurisdictional
amount,
even
on
your
own
theory?
