well,
who
filed
the...
the
consolidated
complaint?
your...
presumably
you
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
had
different
parties
and
different
complaints
than...
than
the
separate
state
actions.

day
o'connor
why
did
you
file
that
consolidated
complaint
in
that
fashion?
it
was
before
the
district
court
as
part
of
a
pretrial
situation
in
a
multi-court
jurisdiction
problem.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
didn't
it
do
more
than
just
organize
the
pleadings?
didn't
it
change
parties
and
causes
of
action
and
look
like
a
whole
new
ball
of
wax?
