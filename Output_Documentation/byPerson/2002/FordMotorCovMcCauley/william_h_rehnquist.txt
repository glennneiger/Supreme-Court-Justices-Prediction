chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
01-896,
the
ford
motor
company
and
citibank
v.
john
b.
mccauley.
mr.
waxman.
the
court
would
appreciate
hearing
argument
on,
i'm
sure,
not
just
on
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
but
on
the
question
posed
in
the
supplemental
briefing
about
whether
there
is
appellate
jurisdiction
where
a
nominally
prevailing
party
in
the
district
court
can...
can
appeal,
and
also
about
whether
the
question
of...
under
1447(d),
if
this
was
an
order
of
remand,
whether
the...
the
thing
was
appealable
to
the
ninth
circuit
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
ordinarily
you
wouldn't
go...
go
about
it
that
way.
you'd
have
a
memorandum,
not
a
consolidated
complaint.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
the
district
court
say
it
had
no
subject
matter?
because
of
the
amount
in
controversy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
consolidated
complaint?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
stayed
by
the
ninth
circuit
prior
to
argument
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
that
stay
expire
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
waxman.
mr.
berman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i...
it
was
your
clients,
mr.
berman,
who
filed
the
consolidated
complaint
in
the
western
district,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
who
was
it
that
moved
to
dismiss
that
complaint?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
did
he...
on
the
subject
matter
ground
that
there's
not...
not
$75,000
in
controversy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
lexecon,
we
said
that
the
judge
who...
to
whom
it
was
referred
for
pretrial...
couldn't
try
the
case
unless
both
parties
consented,
didn't
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
says
remand
to
the
state--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
the
court
would
like
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
your
objection
just
to
the
concept
of
administrative
costs,
mr.
berman,
or
to
the
idea
that
it
can
be
compute...
the
amount
in
controversy
can
be
computed
at
all
from
the
defendants'
point
of
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a...
in
a
couple
of
those
quotes,
you
know,
taken
out
of
context,
they
seem
to
support
your
position.
they
certainly
don't
controvert
your
position.
but
the
court
wasn't
really
faced
with
the
issue
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
that's
not
the
same
as
for
specific
performance
purposes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
berman.
mr.
waxman,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
01-896,
ford
motor
company
versus
mccauley.
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
