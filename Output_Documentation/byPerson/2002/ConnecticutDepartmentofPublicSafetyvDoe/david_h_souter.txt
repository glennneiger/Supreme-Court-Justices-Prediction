justice
david
h.

would
you...
would
you
agree
that
there
is
at
least
some
subclass
of
cases
here
in
which
the
non-dangerousness
could
be
shown
in
a
way
that
probably
was
highly
accurate
and
did
not
involve
the...
the
difficulties
that
you
raise?
what
i've
got
in
mind
is
this.
the...
the
categories
of
individuals
who
are
listed
under
the
connecticut
statute
include
young
men
who
as
teenagers
had
intercourse
with
younger
teenage
girls.
no
one,
by
normal
standards
of
english
usage,
would
say
at
the
age
of
25
that...
that
a...
a
young
man
like
that
is
dangerous
in
any
sense
that
we
would
associate
dangerousness
with...
violent
sex
acts
and
things
of
that
sort.
so
there
seems
to
be
a...
a
category,
not
merely
a
set
of
individuals
who
may
prove
they're
not
dangerous,
but
a
category
that
is
presumptively
not
dangerous
in
the
sense
that
the
others
are.
and
yet,
there
is
no
way
for
them,
in
effect,
to...
to
get
themselves
declared
ineligible
for
the...
for
the
stigmatization
that...
that
goes
on.
why
isn't
there
a
due
process
problem
that
is
legitimately
raised
as
at
least
to
a
category
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do...
what
do
they
have
to
do
to
get
the
exception?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
ones
who
have
already
been
sentenced?
in
other
words,
the...
the...
sort
of
the
carryover
class
that
you
pick
up
the
minute
the
statute
goes
into
effect?
i
mean,
these...
these
are
the
ones
who
are
the...
raising
in...
in
the
prior
case,
the
ones
who
are
raising
the
ex
post
facto
kind
of
claim.
what
do
you
do
about
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
take...
take...
simply
take
the
case
as
an
example.
the
19-year-old
boy
the...
whatever
it
is...
14-year-old
girl
have
intercourse.
is...
is
that
person,
if
convicted
prior
to
the
date
of
the
statute,
subject
to
exception
from
the
listing,
and...
and
how--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
before
we
get
to
line
drawing,
i
misunderstood
your
response
to
me
i
guess.
what
is
the
answer?
are
those
people
in
my
hypothetical
exempted
or
do
they
have
a
process
by
which
they
can
be
exempted
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
justice
breyer
understands
that
they
would
not
be
exempted
from
listing.
and
i...
i
guess...
is
he
right
or
isn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume...
you
know,
we
accept
the
fact
that
line
drawing
has
to
be
done
and
so
do
the
other
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
case.
their
claim
is
that
the
fact
is
we've
got
at
least
some
category
which
we
can
identify
on
a
categorical
basis
which
is
being
stigmatized
as
dangerous
for
a
period
of...
i
guess,
a
minimum
of
10
years.
and
all
they're
asking
for
is
a
way
out.
they're
not
even
claiming
that
you
affirmatively
have
got
to
make
a
proof
of
dangerousness
in
the
first
instance
with
respect
to
those.
they
are
saying,
as
a
matter
of
procedural
due
process,
there
ought
to
be
a
way
out
and
there
is
none.
that's
not
to
contest
line
drawing.
that
is
to
contest
the
fact
that
the
state
could
let
them
have
the
burden
of
getting
out,
and
the
state
still
won't
do
it.
what
is
the
justification?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
that
is
not...
i
don't
think
that's
their
argument.
their
argument
is
not
that
they
are...
are
being
subject
to
a
stigma
for
10
years
because
they
were
convicted.
they
are
being
subject
to
a
stigma
for
10
years
because
the
state
of
connecticut
is
saying
through
the
internet
in...
in
effect,
that
they
are
currently
dangerous.
that's
the
stigma,
not
the
conviction,
the
current
state
of
dangerousness
which
is
stigmatizing.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
what
it
means
is
what
you
have
just...
to
begin
with,
what
you
just
stipulated,
that
in
fact
there
is
a
higher
probability,
a...
a
greater
risk
of...
of
dangerousness.
but
if,
in
fact,
there
is
no
means
of
differentiation
for
any
one
person
on
the
register,
then
that
probability
judgment
is
going
to
be
applied
in
the
public
mind,
naturally,
to
every
person
on
that
unless
there
is
a
way
to
establish
an
exemption.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
is,
and
yet
the
very
fact
that
the
state
chooses
to
list
that
crime
is
a
clear
indication
that
the
state
thinks
that
people
in
that
category
of
crime
deserve
to
be
listed
with
others
who
are
potentially
dangerous.
so
the
state's
very
categorical
treatment,
in
effect,
has
said
to
the
public,
you
can't
draw
any
clear
distinctions
based
on
the
particular
crimes
that
we'll
also
inform
you
of.
you've
already
made
the
categorical
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
for
the
fact
that...
that
the...
the
state
has
made
a
judgment
and
it
doesn't
deny
it,
that
individuals
who
have
been
convicted
of
crimes
in
the
categories
subject
to
the
law,
are
as
a
categorical
matter
more
likely
to
commit
them
in
the
future.
they
are
more
likely
to
be
dangerous
than
the
general
population.
and
so
it's
true.
the
state
does
not,
in
its
register,
say,
and
by
the
way,
this
john
doe
is
especially
dangerous.
but
the
state
can't
deny
that
it's
saying
this
john
doe
is
part
of
the
category
that
we
think
dangerous
enough
to
list
through
the
internet.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
can't.
i
mean,
it
cannot
do
that
on
the...
on
the
basis
of
what
the
state
puts
out
because
all
it
knows,
from
what
the
state
puts
out,
is
the
category
the
person
falls
into.
justice
david
h.
souter
all...
all
of
which,
however,
are
regarded
as
being
within
some...
above
some
threshold
of
dangerousness
or
they
wouldn't
be
listed
on
the
internet.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
have
people
said
there's
no
escape?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
isn't
it...
it's
also
squarely
within
procedural
due
process.
the...
the
state
is
saying
you're
putting
a
label
on
me,
and
that's
okay
if
you
give
me
a
way
to
get
out
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
a
procedural
due
process
challenge.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's
where...
i
mean,
i
think
that's
where
the...
the...
we're
not
sort
of
meeting
each
other
in
the
argument.
the
state
does
say
that
much.
no
question
about
it.
but
by
this
categorized
treatment,
the
state
is
saying
something
further.
the
state
is
saying
people
in
these
categories
are
likely
to
be
more
dangerous.
it's
a...
it's
the
second
statement
that
is
the
gravamen
of
the
problem
that
we've
got
here,
not
the
truthful
first
statement.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
nobody
is...
nobody
is
saying
it
can't.
nobody
is
saying
connecticut
can't
do
this.
all
they're
saying
is
if
connecticut
does
it,
they've
got
to
give
us
an...
an
escape
hatch.
justice
david
h.
souter
if...
if
there
is
no
potential
for
a
defamatory
or
stigmatizing
statement,
then
there
is
no
case.
i
agree
with
you.
but
simply
to
say
there's
no
defamation
here
is...
is,
with
respect,
it
seems
to
me,
to
try
to
avoid
the
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
stigma
plus
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
wearing
the
badge?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
there
stigma
plus
then
in
creating
a...
in
effect,
a
subclass
of
citizens
who
have
got
to
go
through
quarterly
registration
possibly
for
the
rest
of
their
lives?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
excuse
me.
are
you
claiming
that
there's
got
to
be
a
determination
in
advance
before
the
person
can
be
put
on
the
register,
or
are
you
claiming
that
a
person
who
is
on
the
register
who
claims
to
be
non-dangerous
should
be
allowed
a
hearing
to
get
off
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
never
mind...
what
is
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
has
there
got
to
be
a
hearing
in
advance
before
the
name
goes
on?
