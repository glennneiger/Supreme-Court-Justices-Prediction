does
this...
does
this
category
fit?
let's
take...
those
ages
will
do
fine,
19
and
14.
does
that
fit
within
an
excepted
category?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
that
there
are
certain
categories
of
people
who
can
be
exempted
from
that,
and
i
asked
if
the
hypothetical
that
justice
souter
raised...
that
particular
hypothetical...
fits
within
that
exempted
or
excepted
class.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--nineteen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
is
the
category?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
category,
general
blumenthal,
in
which
such
a
person
might
go
back?
there
seem
to
be
rather
precise
categories
that
are
excepted
with
an
age
range,
and
if
you
fall
outside
that
age
range,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
built
into
this
scheme
any
discretionary
exercises.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could
skip
that
entirely.
you
get...
this
is
on
the...
it's
not
listed...
i
can
go
to
the
internet
and
go
directly
to
the
person.
this
information...
this
disclaimer...
is
not
associated
with
the
individual
offender
listing.
it's...
it's
stuck
in
the
middle
of
a
bunch
of
stuff
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
think
that's
the
issue.
i
think
the
issue
is
the
state
says
here's
a
list
of
people
who
were
convicted
of
sex
offenses.
period.
you're
telling
us
that
this
particular
person
is
no
longer
dangerous.
we
say
that's
not
relevant
to
our
scheme.
there's
only
one
thing
that's
relevant:
was
he
or
she
convicted?
if
he
or
she
was
convicted,
you
have
nothing
under
our
scheme
to
be
heard
about
because
the
only
due
process
conviction...
the
only
due
process
hearing
that
counts
is
the
one
that
led
up
to
the
conviction.
that's...
that's
the
point,
that
you're
saying
my
person
is
no
longer
dangerous.
the
state's
answer
is,
under
our
scheme
that's
totally
irrelevant.
the
only
question
is,
was
this
person
convicted
of
a
sex
offense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
now
suppose...
that's...
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
is
your
real
argument.
suppose
the
list
said,
not
sex
offender
register,
but
register
of
persons
convicted...
convicted
sex
offender
list.
it
said
that.
and
then
it
put
the
disclaimer
that
we
are
making
no
judgment
about
this
person's
dangerousness
right
on
that
web
page
with
the
picture,
right
on
the
page
with
the
individual's
picture,
and
then
it
gave
the
offense
of
conviction,
the
date,
the
time
served,
and
that's
what
was
presented...
with
that
legend
in
bold
face...
every
time
a
user
goes
to
get
a
picture
sees
that
warning
of
what
the
state's
purpose
is...
would
you
still
have
a
procedural
due
process
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
i
don't
get
the
link
with
the
hearing
that
you're
asking
for.
that
your
address
has...
anytime
somebody's
address
is...
his
current
address
or
place
of
employment...
is
it
a
government
record?
they
have
a
right
to
get
that
out?
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
i'm
following
what
is
the
hearing
that
you're
entitled
to
because
the
government
supplies
your
current
address.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
the
burden
on
the
government
to...
i
want
to
get
the
full
dimensions
of
your
position.
the
registry
is
all
right,
i
gather.
there
was
no
injunction
against
the
registry.
the
registry
remains
in
place.
so
you're
attacking
only
the
notification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
your
position
on
the
notification
is
not
simply
that
a
person
should
have
an
opportunity
to
show
that
he
or
she
should
escape
from
this
list,
but
that
the
government
has
the
burden
before
it
puts...
posts
anybody
to
show
that
that
person
is
currently
dangerous.
is
that
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
the
category
of
violent
sex
offenders.
they're
on
the
registry.
you
don't
dispute
that.
they're
there.
everyone
is
on
the
registry.
can
that
person,
the
most
violent,
automatically
be
posted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
no
one...
no
one
could
be
put
on--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
to
turn
a
little
attention
to
what
is
the
plus?
because
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
when
you
take
the
registry,
you
say
is
the
plus,
and
yet,
you
don't
challenge
the
registry
and
the
district
court
doesn't
require
any
change
whatever
in
the
registry.
so
how
can
something
that
you
say
you're
not
seeking
to
disturb
or
at
least
you're
not
challenging
the
district
court
for
not
disturbing
it
is
the
plus?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
we
didn't
have
the
posting,
we
just
had
the
register,
and
you
had
to
tell
those
things
that
you
ordinarily
wouldn't
have
to
tell
the
state.
