justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
second
circuit's
position
puts
us...
decision
puts
us
in
a
somewhat
difficult
position.
it's
a
procedural
due
process
opinion,
and
we
have
to
say,
procedural
due
process
to
protect
what
right?
so
we
have
to
go
back
and
find
out
what
the
basic
right
they're
talking
about
is,
and
i
suppose
the
narrow
way
to
do
is
to
look
just
to
whether
or
not
there's...
there's
a
paul
versus
virginia
type
of
claim
with
this...
with
this...
with
a
stigma--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
public
also
understands
that
official
records
have
to
be
interpreted
in
different
ways.
we've
said
that
in...
in
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
when
there's
a
notice
on
the
police
bulletin
board
and
the
press
publishes
it,
it
says
what
it
says.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this...
if...
if
you
have
sort
of
a
first
amendment
argument
you're
concerned
with
here,
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
arguing
at
cross
purposes
to
our
precedents.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
this...
this
same
information
was
on
the...
on
the
internet
through
some
private
service
and
i
got
into
the
internet,
and
i
said
i
don't
want
to
live
next
to...
to
this
person.
that
is
my
judgment
that
i
can
make--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--based
on
a
public
record.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
what
is
the
finding?
that
they
have
to
be
likely
to...
to
offend
again?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
people
could
be
confined
under
hendricks,
and
then
the
law
serves
no...
no
purpose
at
all.
