mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
general
blumenthal
conveyed
three
very
important
aspects
of
this
case
in
his
opening
sentence.
in
essence,
he
said
the
people
of
connecticut
seek
access
to
concededly
truthful,
public
record
and
otherwise
public
available
information
concerning
convicted
sex
offenders.
these
individuals
have
no
constitutional
right
to
conceal
these
public
truths
from
interested
public
citizens.
the
second
circuit
examined
the
registry
and
said
not
only
is
the
information
about
every
individual
concededly
true,
but
the
registry...
and
this
is
set
out
verbatim
in
page
6
of
connecticut's...
the
blue
brief.
the
department
of
public
safety
has
not
considered
or
assessed
the
specific
risk
of
re-offense
of
any
individual
prior
to
his
or
her
inclusion
within
this
registry
and
has
made
no
determination
that
any
individual
included
in
the
registry
is
currently
dangerous.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
exactly.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
it
is
not
repeated
for
every
name
in
the
registry,
but
it's
clearly
set
forth
in
the
registry
itself.
it's
put
in
italics.
and
the...
and
the
state
goes
on
to
say,
individuals
included
within
the
registry
are
included
solely
by
virtue
of
their
conviction
record
and
state
law.
the
main
purpose
of
providing
the...
this
data
on
the
internet
is
to
make
the
information
more
easily
accessible
and
available,
not
to
warn
about
any
specific
individual--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
what
they
do
say
is
that
the
public
is
entitled
to
and
should
make
specific
judgments
about
specific
individuals.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
precisely.
and
the
point
that
you
were
making
earlier,
justice
souter,
is
that
there
are
different
types
of
crimes
that
may
be
of
interest
to
different
individuals.
if
you
have
small--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--because
they
are...
they
are
responding
to
the
people's
request
in
50
states...
and
the
people
of
the
united
states
through
the
congress...
to
make
information
available
to
us
about
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
sex
crimes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if...
if...
there...
that's...
the
federal
statute
allows
the
state
to
exercise
judgment
with
respect
to
the
use
of
its
resources
with
respect
to
this
public
record,
truthful
information.
now,
the
state
of
connecticut...
the
question
that
you're
raising,
it
seems
to
me,
falls
squarely
within
the
concept
of
a
substantive
due
process
challenge,
not
a--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
the
state--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
label
that
the
state
is
putting
on
is
that
you
have
been
convicted
of
a
sex
crime
and
that
the...
and
you
must
draw...
we
have
not
decided
that
you
are
dangerous.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the...
the
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
the...
this
court
will
examine
challenges
with
respect
to
the...
the...
in
that
category
on
a
substantive
due
process
basis
if
the
classification
is
reasonable--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
and...
and
our
submission
is
that
the
determination...
and
this
court
has
stated
it
as
recently...
recently
as
a
year
ago
that
sex
offenders
are
more
likely
to
be
recidivists
than
other
categories
of
individuals,
but
that
that
does
not
mean,
connecticut
goes
on
to
say,
that
any
individual
is
necessarily
dangerous.
that
classification
is
rational.
now,
it
is
also
rational
for
connecticut
to
have
determined,
as
it
did,
that
we'll
accord
opportunities
for
people
to
address
in...
in
certain
circumstances
the
nature
of
their
conviction.
but
it's
also
rational
for--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
think
that
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
situation,
justice
stevens,
in
that...
the...
and...
and
i
would
be
concerned
about
that.
but--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
because
that
requires
the
individual
to
carry
that
notification
himself
to
convey
the
government's
message.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
also
requires
that
message
to
be
brought
into
every
situation
that
the
individual
is
involved
in.
the
internet
is
a
reasonable
and
relative...
minimally
intrusive
way
of
responding
to
a
question
that
a
citizen
may
ask
of
a
state
and
to
which
the
citizen
is
entitled
to
an
answer.
the
citizen
here
has
to
ask
the
question.
it
isn't
carried
around
with
the
individual
everywhere
the
individual
goes.
and
this
is
public
record
information.
as
one
of
the
questions
in
the
earlier
argument
implied,
if
a
private
citizen...
cox
broadcasting,
for
example...
decided
to
make
this
information
available
to
the
public,
it
would
be...
have
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
do
so.
it
seems
anomalous
to
suggest
that
the
state
of
connecticut
cannot
impart
to
its
citizens
the
same
information
that
cox
broadcasting
would
have
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
do
so.
it
seems
to
us--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
seems
to
me,
justice
souter,
that
that
conflicts
directly
with
what
the
court
said
in
paul
versus
davis,
that
in
the
first
place,
there
is
not
defamation
here
because
it's
a
truthful
imparting
of
information.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
don't
think
it
is,
but...
but
even
if
it
were
defamation,
it
is
not...
there
is
no
stigma
plus,
as
this
court
required
in
paul
versus
davis.
there's
no
confinement
of
liberty.
there's
no
denial
of
any
individual
on
this
list
of
a
right
to
a
job--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
may
well
be.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it...
it...
we
submit
that
that
is
a
minimal,
reasonable
way
for
the
state
to
keep
track
of
people
who
have
committed
crimes
and
then--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
they
are
because
the
state
has
made
a
determination,
as
have
49
other
states
and
congress,
that
the
people
are
entitled
to
certain
public
record
information.
that
does
not
apply--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's...
well,
it
is...
it
is
incomplete
information
as
to
everyone,
we
submit.
but
it
does...
it
is
complete
information
with
respect
to
whether
individuals
have
been
convicted
of
a
sex
crime.
that
is
public
information.
that
is
information
to
which
the
citizens
are
entitled.
thank
you.
