justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's...
that's
right
there,
but
that
is
not
the
challenge
that's
being
made.
there's
no
challenge
being
made
here
that
the
state
cannot
have
a
register...
or
a
register
that
is...
is
structured
by
category.
the
challenge
that's
being
made
here
is
that
if
you
do
that,
there
should
be
a
due...
there
should
be
a
procedural
mechanism
for
somebody
who
can
show
that
he's
not
dangerous
to
get
out.
that
isn't
substantive
due
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
danger...
potentially
dangerous.
i
mean,
the
government
doesn't
have
to
make
a...
a
rock-solid
assessment
that
these
people
are
dangerous.
why
isn't
it
enough
for
the
government
to
say
this
is
a
category
of
people
who
may
be
dangerous?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
that
true?
it
is
perfectly
true.
can
the
public
act
on
it?
if
it
wants
to,
it
can;
if
it
doesn't
want
to,
it
doesn't
have
to.
it
may
make
further
assessment
of
whether,
indeed,
the
may
is...
is
close
enough
or...
or...
but...
i
don't
know
why
you
insist
on
saying
that
the...
that
the
state
has
said
these
people
are
dangerous.
it
seems
to
me,
even
without
the
disclaimer,
the
most
the
state
has
said
is
that
these
people
may
be
dangerous.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
hasn't...
he
hasn't
even
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
somebody
who's
on
that
list.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
he's
in
a
much
better
position
than...
than
your
clients.
as
far
as
anybody
knows,
he's
totally
innocent,
and
the
fbi
puts
him
up
there
as
the
most
wanted
without
a
hearing.
your
clients
have
had
a
hearing.
they've
been
found
to...
to
be
guilty.
they're...
it
seems
to
me
they're
in
much
worse
shape
than
somebody
on
the
fbi
list.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
but
just
putting
him...
putting
his
face
out
there
tells
the
public,
does
it
not,
this
is
a
dangerous
person
you
ought
to
be
on
the
lookout
for.
he
hasn't
had
any
hearing
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
people
of
connecticut
don't
trust
those
dangerousness
hearings.
maybe
the
people
of
connecticut
say,
i
don't
want
to
have
to
rely
upon...
upon
the
guesses
of
some
psychiatrist.
i
do
not
want
to
live
next
to
somebody
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
sexual...
sexually
predatory
offense,
and
i
don't
care
what
the
psychiatrists
say.
now,
can...
can
the
state
of
connecticut
accede
to
the
wishes
of
the
public
who
feel
that
way
about
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
citizens
may
not
trust
them.
citizens
have
seen
too
many
of
these
hearings
that
result
in
the
release
of
people
who
turn
out
to
be
dangerous.
why...
why
do
you
insist
that
the
state
must
tell
citizens,
we're
not
going
to
give
you
this
information
because
we
have
determined
that
the
person
is...
is
not
dangerous
and
therefore
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it?
