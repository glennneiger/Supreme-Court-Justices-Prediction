ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
eyes
of
a
concerned
public,
every
person
posted
on
connecticut's
megan's
law
list
poses
a
serious
threat
to
the
public,
particularly
to
children.
the
public
knows
that
megan's
law
is
named
for--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--petitioners
themselves
have
stated--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--that...
that
the
public
knows
this
is
a
megan's
law
list?
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
the...
the
message
of
dangerousness
comes
from
a
number
of
sources,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
the
purpose
of
this
law,
the
declared
purpose
of
this
law,
repeated
by
petitioners
and
repeated
by
the
lawmakers
who
passed
it,
is
to
protect
the
public
from
recidivist
sex
offenders,
and
particularly
to
protect
the
children
from
such
offenders.
the
law
is
administered
and
the
registry
is
both
put
together
and
published
by
the
state
police.
the
state
police
on
the
website
state
that
it
is
their
mission
to
prevent
crime
and
protect
the
public.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
they
don't
actually.
the
disclaimer
does
not
say
that
everybody
is
not
dangerous.
what
the
disclaimer
says
is
that
no
dangerousness
assessment
is
made
with
respect
to
any
individual.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
it
isn't
good
enough
because
all
it
says
is
what
we
already
know,
which
is
that
nobody
has
been
assessed
for
dangerous
or
not.
and
it's
contradicted
by
the
repeatedly
emphasized
message
to
the
public,
which
petitioners
themselves
stressed
so
urgently
below,
that
the
purpose
of
this
law
is
to
publish
current,
monitored
information
taken
from
offenders
so
that
it
can
be
posted
on
the
internet
so
the
public
will
know
what
they
look
like
and
where
they
live
at
all
times.
that
sends
a
very
compelling
message.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
there
were...
the...
the
court...
the
district
court's
decision
and
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
affirmed
it
were
based
on
rule
9(c)
statements,
undisputed
facts
on
summary
judgment,
and
they
included
the
fact
that
this
is
commonly
known
as
a
megan's
law.
there's
no
disputing
that.
everybody
in
this
country
knows
that
megan's
law
was
passed
in
response
to
the
rape
and
murder
of
a
child
victim.
that
is
the
genesis
of
these
laws,
and
it's
undisputed
that
that's
how
the
public
understands
them.
also
not
in
dispute
is
that
it
is
the
department--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--except
that
these--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--as
i
understand
your
question,
if...
the
problem
is
that
it
is
not
just
truthful,
already
public
information.
the
list
does
not
just
include
someone's
conviction.
it
also
includes
a
current
photograph
and
a
current
address--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--the
current
photograph
and
the
current...
it
is
not
because
the
message
that
it
conveys
is
that
this
is
a
person
who
is
being
watched
and
monitored,
who
must,
at
risk
of
felony
conviction--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--it
is
that
there
is
an
established
liberty
interest
in...
in
a
government
impose...
in
avoiding
a
government-imposed
stigma,
which
is
not
just
government
name-calling.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
but
it
is
more
than
a
liberty
interest
and
reputation.
this
is
a
government-imposed
stigma
which
is...
it's
part
and
parcel
of
the
regulations
that
are
imposed
on
people.
the
information
posted
on
the
registry
is
extracted
from
registrants.
on
pain
of
felony
conviction,
they
must--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--this
is
not
a
truthful
statement.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
no.
a
truthful
statement
can
also
be
stigmatizing,
but...
but
it's
not--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--i
think
paul
versus
davis
requires
that
there
be
a...
as
there
is
in
this
case,
a
false
stigma.
and
i
think
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
understanding
and
the
basis
of
this
law.
this
is
a
law
which
was
designed
to...
and
the
public
knows
it
was
designed
to...
protect
the
public
from
dangerous,
recidivist
offenders,
and
that
is
not
true
with
respect
to
many
of
the
people,
perhaps
most
of
the
people...
we
don't
know...
who
are
on
this
list.
not
only--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--the
government
says--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--the
state
says...
with
respect,
the
state
says
more,
but
even
if
it
said
that
these...
that
these
people
may
be
more
dangerous
than
other
people,
that
too
reduces
people
in
the
eyes...
in
the
eyes
of
the
public.
it
causes
people
to,
as
any
injury
to
reputation
would,
not
want
to
hire
them,
not...
want
to
avoid
them,
not
want
to
live
in
the
same
neighborhoods
with
them.
and
this
court,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
are
statistics
which
show
that
this...
that
some
subgroup
of
sex
offenders
are
more
likely
to
recidivate,
this
court
has
never
relied
just
on
statistical
information
to
make
dangerousness
assessments
about
individuals,
even
in
the
context--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--well,
there
are
two
points--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--there
are
two
points
with
respect
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
a
private
citizen
would
not
have
the
power,
as
the
government
does,
to
obtain
current...
to
require
people
to
register
current
photographs
and
current
addresses
for
posting,
and
there
is
not
the
same
government-imposed
imprimatur.
these
are
people
who
are
being
watched.
we
are
requiring
them
to
provide
this
information
to
us
on
a
regular
basis.
we
advertise
on
the
website
that
we
keep
this
information
as
updated
as
possible
in...
in
furtherance
of
the
department
of
public
safety's
declared
mission
of
protecting
the
public
and
preventing
crime.
all...
the
entire
context
of
this
registry
and
the
purpose
of
the
law
sends
the
ineluctable
message
that
the
people
who
are
posted
pose
a
present
threat
to
the
public.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
i
understand,
your
honor,
and
i
think...
let
me
see
if
i
can
respond
to
it
sufficiently.
we
are
not
asking...
first
of
all,
let
me
begin
by
saying
the
reason
we
don't
consider
it
to
be
a
substantive
due
process
analysis
is
that
we're
not
trying
to
expand
the
scope
of
the
due
process
law
to...
to
recognize
some
liberty
that
is
not
already
recognized.
there
is
an
interest
in
reputation
if
it
is
coupled
with
the
kinds
of
restrictions
that
are
imposed
by
this
law.
people
cannot...
literally
cannot...
remain
at
liberty
if
they
do
not
report
what
they
look
like
and
where
they
live
to
the
state.
they
will
be
prosecuted
for
a
felony.
they
cannot
move
without
advising
the
state
that
they
are
doing
so.
they
cannot
even
leave
the
state
for
temporary
periods,
if
they're
of...
of
a
substantial
period
of
time,
without
telling
the
state.
they
literally
cannot
remain
at
liberty
without
performing
these
functions
which
are
not
required
of
any
other
citizen.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
i
think
so.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
and
let...
let
me
try
to
address
it
now
if
i
haven't
done
it
yet.
even
if
there
were...
now,
as
i
understand,
your
honor,
you're
saying
that...
that
even
if
there
were
narrower
categories,
if
we
were
to
limit
this
to
people
who
were
more
dangerous
and
isn't
overbroad,
there
weren't
that...
that
kind
of
issue,
there
still
is
the
problem
because
it
is
a
procedural
due
process
issue
whether
a
particular
person
poses
a
present
threat.
that
isn't
something--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--but
the
problem
with...
the
problem
with
that,
your
honor,
is
that
the
list
does
not
just
say
that
the
person
was
convicted
of
a
sex
offense.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
i
would
if...
i
would
if
the
current
appearances
and
whereabouts
of
those
people
were
also
monitored
for
the
purpose
of
posting
them
on
a
list
whose
stated
purpose
is
to
protect
the
public.
i
would
not
have
a
problem
if
it
is
simply
an
internet
version
of
conviction
records.
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
public
records
of
conviction
and
the
information--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--the
hearing
that
we're
entitled
to...
and
it
isn't...
it
really
is
more
than
just
current
address,
although
that
is
one
aspect
of
it.
monitoring
address
and
photographs
and
posting
it
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
public
does
send
a
message
that
they're
dangerous.
but
even
if
there...
if
there
were
to
be
a...
a
list
that
simply
reflected
past
conviction
records,
that
would
not
pose
a
problem.
it
isn't
just
the
current
address.
it
is
the
combination
of
all
of
these
things.
it
is
the
context.
this
is
a
megan's
law
designed
to
protect
the
public
from
recidivist
child
molesters.
it
is...
it
posts
people
whose
current
appearances
and
whereabouts
are
monitored,
and
the
state
tells
the
public
that
they
are
monitored
on
the
website
itself.
it
says
that
we
provide
this
information
and
we
keep
it
as
current
as...
as
possible.
it
is
the
department
of
public
safety,
the
state
police,
who
post
the
information
beneath
their
prominently
displayed
mission
statement
that
it
is
their
job
in
life
to
protect
the
public
from...
from
crime.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
there's
a
fundamental
distinction
between
them
because...
think
about
it,
your
honor.
the...
the
10
most
wanted
list
is
the
result
of
an
investigation
that
focuses
on
a
particular
individual
and
there
are
exigent
circumstances.
it's
not
just
a
roundup
of...
of
the
usual
suspects.
it
does
focus
on
a
particular
person.
and
that
person
does
not
have,
by
the
way,
the
10-year
to
life
continued
reporting
requirements
based
on
past
conduct.
it
will
be
processed--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--well,
he
may
be
but...
but
consider
when
that
person,
even
if
he
committed
a
violent
crime,
is...
is
arrested
and
when
a
bond
hearing
is
heard,
the
recidivism
statistics
for
this
kind
of
crime,
this
person's
past
conviction
record
even,
will
not
be
the
sole
determinants
and
determine
what...
what
allows
him
to
be
released.
it
will
be--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--the
person
on
the
fbi
list
has
yet
to
have
a
hearing
on
whether
or
not
he
was
the
person
who
committed
the
crime,
and
presumably,
your
honor,
if
he
were
not
and
if
there
were
false
information
that...
that
led
to
his
arrest,
he
would
have
a
claim
for...
for
false
arrest.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
yes,
but
he
will.
and
there
is
at
least
some
individual
assessment,
an
individual
investigation.
that
hasn't
happened
with
respect
to
the
people
on
my
list.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
yes.
your
honor
has
asked
an
even
longer
question,
so
let
me
try
again.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
it...
even...
first
of
all,
this
is
a
very
broad
statute.
it
does
not
cover
just
the
most
dangerous
offenders.
obviously
it
covers
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
nonviolent
crimes,
been
sentenced
to
probation,
been
sentenced
to
unconditional
release.
it
covers
the
teenagers
about
which
there
has
been
some
discussion.
and
by
the
way,
some
of
those
teenagers
can
get
off
and
some
of
them--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--even
with
respect
to...
even
with
respect
to
the
19
worst,
it
still
remains
an
individual
determination
whether
a
person
poses
a
threat.
that
person
could
have
a--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--i'm
saying...
well,
this
is
a...
the
registry
is
systematic.
it's
not
as
though
it's
any
surprise--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--it
is
a--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--there
has
to
be
a
hearing
in
advance
not
before
the
person
registers,
but
before
the
person
is
publicly...
yes,
before
the
person
is
publicly
posted.
and
that
is
true
even
with
respect--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--yes.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
no.
i
am
saying
that
there
has
to
be
notice
that
you
will
be
posted
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
whether
or
not
you
belong
to
the
very
small
class
of
people
who
deserve
to
be
posted.
and
again,
we're
not...
the
reason--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--no.
and
even
under
the
federal
megan's
law...
let
me
point
out
that
even
under
the
federal
megan's
law...
that
small
category
of
people,
sexually
violent
predators,
are
not
allowed
to...
must...
must
have
process
before
the
government
is
allowed
to
monitor
them
every
90
days,
as
everyone
on
connecticut's
registry
is
done.
there
has
to
be
a
court
finding
that,
in
fact,
those
sexually
violent
predators
fit
within
that
category.
and
even
with
respect--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--the...
the
finding
is
that
they
fit
the
definition
of...
there...
there
are
a
number
of
criteria
and
there
are
expert...
expert
testimony
is
required,
and
so
there
are
criteria.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
but
those...
there
is
not
that
kind
of
confinement
law
in
connecticut,
but
there
certainly
is...
there
would
have
to
be
procedure
in
connection
with
that.
there
was
procedure
in
connection
with
hendricks.
there
has
to
be
procedure
in
connection
with
the
sexually
violent
predators
who
are...
who
are
regulated
in
that
way
under
the...
under
the
federal
megan's
law.
and
the
point
is
this:
even
with
respect
to
those
people
who
have
committed
violent
crimes,
there
are
treatment
mechanisms.
this
court
recognized
in
mckune
against
lile
that...
that
recidivism
rates
are
dramatically
reduced
by
people
who
receive
treatment.
it
is
not
difficult
to
provide
these
hearings.
there
are
dangerousness
hearings
done
in
every
court
in
every
state.
in
connecticut
as
well,
there
are
dangerousness
assessments
conducted
even
within
the
context
of
this
megan's
law,
connecticut's
megan's
law,
in
connection
with
exceptions
and
exemptions
to
registration.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
the
state
of
connecticut
can
accede
to
the
wishes
of
the
public
to
have
conviction
information.
the
neighbor
your
honor
talks
about
has
a
name.
he
can
be
looked
up.
the
neighbor
can
see
whether
or
not
he
has
a
prior
conviction
and
can
move
if
it
wishes.
but
the
state
of
connecticut
does
not
have
the
right,
without
providing
some
individual
process,
some
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
to
tell
the
neighbor
this
is
a
person
who
is
dangerous.
we
have
the
state
police
monitoring
this
person.
he
must
report
to
us
every
90
days.
if
he
does
not
return
his
address
notification,
he
will
be
arrested.
this
is
somebody
we
are
watching.
this
is
somebody
with
respect
to
whom
we
are
giving
you
this
information.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
it
presents
a
different
question.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
the--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--if
there
has
been
process
in
connection
with
the
parole
determination,
the
answer
is
no.
that's
the
fundamental
point.
even
with
respect
to...
this
court,
again,
has
never
used
statistics
even
that...
even
that
apply
to
some
subset
to
determine
that
an
individual
poses
a
present
threat,
the
kind
of
serious
threat
that
the
state
of
connecticut
repeatedly
has
said
that
is
posed
by
the
people
on
this
list.
at...
at
oral
argument
below,
general
blumenthal
argued
that
this
was
crucial
information
which
was
necessary
to
protect
the
public
from...
from
the
kinds
of
dangers
that...
that
occurred
in
the
megan
kanka
case.
this
is
not
just
a...
this
is
not
a
system
of
government
name-calling.
it
is
a
system
of
government-imposed
stigma
with
requirements
which
preclude
someone
from
remaining
at
liberty
if
they
do
not
comply
and
if
the
information
that...
and
the
information
that
they
then
give
up
to
the
state,
otherwise
private,
personal
information,
is
posted
on
the
internet
for
the
repeatedly-declared
purpose
of
protecting
the
public
from
the
people
who
are
posted.
and
again,
the
federal
wetterling
act
requires
only
that
relevant
information
be
released
that
is
necessary
to
protect
the
public
from
a
particular
person.
that
is
why
this
is
an
individual--
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
--excuse
me?
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
if
you
change
your
address,
if
you
change
your
name,
you
must...
you
must
report
to
the
state.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
if
you
change
your
address.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
you...
you...
i
think
you
would
have
to
report
that
too.
i
don't
remember
whether
there's
a
particular
provision,
but
there...
there
are
provisions
that
you
must...
you
must
update
your
current
address
and
information,
and
i...
i
presume
name
is...
is
the
same.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
it
does
actually,
and
you
are
required
to
submit
to
photographs
whenever
and
wherever
the
state
tells
you
to
and
at
least
every
5
years.
the
answer
is
yes.
you
cannot
even
leave
the
state
for...
for,
you
know,
any...
any
substantial
period
of
time
without
reporting...
without
reporting
that.
and
all
of
this
is
on
pain
of
felony
conviction.
that's
true
even
if
the
underlying
conviction
which
requires
you
to
report
were
a
misdemeanor.
and
one
more...
one
final
point.
the
hearings
that
are...
about
which
the
attorney
general
says
there
is
no
reliability,
not
only
are
they
conducted
under
the
federal
wetterling
act
and
in
connection
with
the
exemptions
and
exceptions
under
connecticut's
act,
but
there
are
a
number
of
states
with
already
streamlined,
well-positioned
systems
who
conduct
these
kinds
of
hearings
and
who
provide
process.
there
has
been
no
complaint
that
those
are
unworkable
systems.
they
are
performed...
the...
the...
less
than
half
the
states
in
this
country
have
categorical
notification
systems
like
connecticut's.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
but
it
isn't
a
question
of
just
giving
the
public
truthful
information.
the
issue
is
telling
the
public
that
these
are
people
who
need
to
be
monitored.
they
are
dangerous,
not
you
may
think
they're
dangerous
and
they...
and
you
may
not,
but
they
are.
that
is
why
we
are
doing
this
to
them.
that's
why
we
need
to
know
what
they
look
like
and
where
they
live
at
all
times,
and
you
need
to
know
what
they
look
like
and
where
they
live
at
all
times.
that
sends...
that
sends
a
very
different
message
from
they
may
be
or
they
may
not
be.
that
says
that
they
are.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
because
they
are
integrally
related.
remember,
my
understanding
of
the
stigma
plus
test
is
that
it
was
meant
to
distinguish
just
plain
defamation
cases
from
those
which
really
were
fourteenth
amendment
claims
based
on
something
the
government
was
doing
to
you.
the
plus
here
is
that
the
government
requires
you,
on
pain
of
felony
conviction,
to
provide
the
personal
information
that
then
is
published.
it
is
an
integral
system.
it
creates
a
new
class
of
citizen,
a
second
class
of
citizen,
which
has
different
obligations
from
other
citizens
and
from
which
information,
personal
and
otherwise
private
information,
is
extracted
and
then
posted.
private
citizens
do
not
have
to
tell
the
state
where
they
live
at
all
times.
they
don't
have
to
tell
the
state
when
they
are
leaving.
they
don't
have
to
provide
photographs
repeatedly.
ms.
shelley
r.
sadin
it
would
be
a
different
argument.
that...
that's
the
plus.
