mr.
richard
blumenthal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
like
alaska's,
is
about
fully
accurate,
concededly
true
public
record
information
about
convicted
sex
offenders
that
citizens
of
connecticut
and
the
50
other
states
need
and
deserve...
indeed,
they
demand
be
made
available
and
accessible...
so
they
can
make
choices
about
how
to
protect
themselves,
their
families,
and
their
children.
and
each
of
the
convicted
sex
offenders
on
this
registry
has
received
a
hearing,
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
many
of
them
a
trial,
all
of
them
the
full
panoply
of
due
process
rights
and
have
been
found
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
we
are,
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice,
talking
only
about
the
due
process
issue
and
only
about
whether,
first,
the
listing
on
this
registry
is
defamatory
and,
second,
whether
the
defamation,
if,
in
fact,
it
exists...
and
we
say
it
doesn't...
is
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
in
the
way
that
it
is
imposed
here,
that
is,
under
paul
v.
davis,
whether
there
is
a
loss
or
alteration
of
right
or
status
as
a
result
of
that
defamation--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--the...
the
claim
has
been
a
procedural
due
process
claim,
although
the
united
states
as
amicus
has
raised...
and
we
welcome
that
it
has
raised...
the
substantive
due
process
issue.
but--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--i
don't
know
whether
the
court
is
more
hospitable
to
claims
that
may
be
raised
by
amici
from
the
united
states
government,
but
it
certainly
is
a
relevant
issue
to
be
addressed
here
because
many
of
the
claims
raised
under
the
guise
of
due
process
really
involve
line
drawing
and
categories.
for
example,
the
question
of
which
offenses
should
be
listed
on
the
registry
really
is
a
legislative
determination.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
certainly
that
is
the
way
the...
the
case
comes
to
the
court,
raising
that
issue,
and
it's
one
that
we
believe
merits
reversal
of
the
second
circuit.
we
agree...
and
i
must
say
very
emphatically
we
agree
so
far
as
the
issue
of
stigma
is
concerned...
that
the
implication
as
reached
by
the
second
circuit
is
correct,
that
is,
that
every
person
on
this
list
is
more
likely
than
the
average
person
to
be
currently
dangerous.
we
think
that
implication
is
true.
every
bit
of
information
on
this
registry,
in
fact,
is
concededly
true.
and
there
is
differentiation
among
the
different
registrants.
the
differentiation
occurs
by
the
offense;
that
is,
the
information
that
is
listed
as
to
when
the
offense
occurred,
the
nature
of
the
offense,
the
number
of
offenses
enables
the
public,
having
this
information
accessible
and
available,
to
make
judgments
about
whether
that
individual
in
fact
may
be
dangerous.
and
of
course--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--there
is--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--justice
stevens,
there
is
no
category
of
information
on
the
registration,
as
it's
made
available
to
the
public,
about
whether
there
has
been
treatment.
the
information
provided
is
very
simply
address,
identifying
factors--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--that
is
correct,
so
far
as
the
information
provided
to
the
public
is
concerned.
and
the
reason,
if
i
may
presume
to
say
it,
may
be
that
the
effectiveness
of
treatment
may
be
problematic,
and
the
same
is
true
with
hearings
on
dangerousness.
the
unreliability
of
these
hearings
has
been
a
very,
very
substantial
problem,
and
the
kind
of
information
that
may
come
to
the
public
from
such
hearings
or
from
information
about
treatment
may
be
as
misleading
as
it
is
accurate
in
many
instances.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
there...
there
is,
in
fact,
justice
souter,
a
category
of
the
registrants
who
are
excepted
for
the...
a...
a
category
of
convicted
offenders
who
are
excepted
from
the
registry
if,
for
example,
they
are
18
or
younger
and
they
commit
statutory
rape,
if
the
victim
is
13
to
16
years
old.
there
are
exceptions
for
making
accessible
to
the
public
information--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--at
the
time
of
sentencing,
that
finding
is
made
by
the
sentencing
court,
or
later,
that
that
kind
of
registration
is
not
required
by
public
safety.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
the...
the
legislature
has
made
a
determination
that
certain...
under
certain
circumstances,
the
crime
is
not
registrable,
that
is,
there
is
no
requirement
for
registration.
in
certain
instances
unquestionably,
justice
souter--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--they...
they
could
go
back
to
the
sentencing
court.
there
is
a
provision--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--that
someone
who
would
fit
the
exceptions
can
go
back
to
the
sentencing
court.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
i
followed
the...
the
specific
class
that
justice
souter
was
referencing.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
i
believe
that
it
could.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
and...
and
that
question
really
is
the
more
fundamental
issue
about
legislative
line
drawing
and
unquestionably--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--maybe
i
should--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--i...
i
believe
that
probably
they
would
not
be
exempted,
although
they
could
go
back
to
the
sentencing
court,
and
determine
whether
the
circumstances
of
that
hypothetical
and...
and...
i'm
not--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--but
i
had
in
mind
all--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
someone
who
was
not
within
the
exemption...
and...
the
hypothetical
may
put
that
person
outside
it...
could
not
go
back.
the...
the
legislature
has
drawn
that
line,
and
it's
done
so
because
it
has
to
draw
lines
somewhere
and
has
imposed
that
classification
because
it's
judged
it
to
be
in
the
public
interest
to
do
so.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
the
justification
is
that
the
information
that
is
put
on
the
registry
is
accurate.
the
stigma,
if
there
is
any
stigma,
results
from
the
conviction
of
that
offense,
and--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--with
all
due
respect,
justice
souter,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
that
the
fact
of
being
on
the
registry
means
that
every
individual
is
subject
to
that
stigma.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
there
is
differentiation
insofar
as
the
crime
itself
is
listed.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
we...
we
can't
really
say,
justice
o'connor,
at
this
point
because
the
internet
availability
has
been
suspended
by
order
of
the
court.
all
of
this
information--
mr.
richard
blumenthal
--it
was
in
effect
for
a
couple
of
years,
and
even
then
it
was
too
early
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
having
any
discernible
effect
statistically,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
point.
i...
i
should
report
that
there
are
now
about
3,000
registrants
and
some
500
approximately
have
been
convicted
again
of
a
registrable
offense.
the
point
here
is,
though,
that
all
of
this
information
is
public
record
information.
the
requirement
and
the
obligation
for
registration
existed
before
1998.
in
fact,
it
began
in
1994.
so
no
status
or
right
was
altered.
and
the
registration
requirement
really
is
separate
from
how
the
information
is
made
available
to
the
public,
and
that
goes
to
the
paul
v.
davis
issue.
and
with
your
permission,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
blumenthal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
following
justice
ginsburg's
question,
there
really
is
no
plus
here.
the
point
is
the
registry
has
not
been
challenged.
the
registry
existed
before
the
posting,
the
publication,
making
this
information
available.
it
exists
now.
if
the
order
were
not
in
effect,
even
without
the
requirement
in
the
law
that
there
be
internet
publication,
an
ordinary
citizen
could
do
what
the
hartford
courant
did
and
file
an
information...
freedom
of
information
request.
the
internet
requirement
is
like
a
freedom
of
information
form
of
law,
and
it
is
unrelated
in
the
way
that
paul
v.
davis
says
it
must
be
related
to
the
supposed
stigma.
even
if
this
court
were
to
find
there's
a
defamation...
and
by
the
way,
connecticut
law
has
never
recognized
defamation
by
implication.
but
even
if
there
were,
paul
v.
davis
says
that
as
a
result
of
the
action
complained
of,
a
right
or
status
recognized
previously
under
state
law
must
be
distinctly
altered
or
extinguished.
in
this
instance,
there
was
no
pre-existing
right
not
to
register.
in
fact,
individuals...
sex
offenders
were
required
to
register,
and
that
obligation
continues
to
exist
afterward.
and
so
what
this
court
would
do
by
accepting
the
second
circuit's
decision
is,
in
effect,
to
constitutionalize
tort
law
in
the
way
that
it
has
declined
to
do
in
paul
v.
davis,
siegert
v.
gilley,
where
again
it
insisted
on
some
causal
link
between
the
defamation
and
the
supposed
loss
of
right
and
status.
and
that
is
utterly
lacking
here.
the
supposed
harms...
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
housing,
employment,
any
other
harm
that
results
from
this
supposed
stigma,
and
the
stigma
itself,
to
go
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
has
to
be
false
in
order
to
constitute
defamation.
this
court
said
so
in
codd
v.
velger,
and
that
is
plainly
not
true
here
because
all
of
this
information,
particularly
as
to
the
convicted
offense,
is
absolutely
truthful
and
leaves
to
connecticut's
citizens
to
make
the
judgment
about
whether
or
not
it
indicates
dangerousness.
the
disclaimer...
to
clear
one
other
point...
very
specifically
says
not
only
that
no
assessment
has
been
made,
but
also
that
the
publication
or
inclusion
of
this
individual
on
the
website
and
on
the
registry
is
not
to
be
deemed
a
judgment
or
a
conclusion
that
this
person
is
dangerous.
there's
a
specific
disclaimer
as
to
dangerousness.
but
even
without
it,
we
would
contend
there's
no
stigma
because
all
of
this
information
is
very
simply
public
record
information,
and
under
siegert
v.
gilley
particularly,
there
is
no
sufficient
link
between
the
supposed
stigma
and
any
loss
of
right
or
status.
there
simply
is
no
plus
here
as
this
court
has
interpreted
it
to
exist
and
must
exist
under
the
standard
that
this
court
has
set
forth.
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
at
the
very
least,
the
plus,
or
the
loss
of
right
or
change
of
status
must
arise
out
of
the
same
action
or
flow
from
it
in
some
way.
and
here
plainly
the
information
that's
conveyed
accurately
and
truthfully
on
the
registry
does
not
in
any
way
cause
the
registration.
it
does
not
result
from
the
registration.
the
registration
continues
to
exist
now
and
would
continue
to
exist
even
after
the
internet
is
taken
off...
is...
come
down
because
of
the
court
order.
so
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
