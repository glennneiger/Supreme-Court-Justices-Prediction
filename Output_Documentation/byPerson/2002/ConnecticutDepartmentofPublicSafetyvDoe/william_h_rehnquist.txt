h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
10-1...
1231,
the
connecticut
department
of
public
safety
versus
john
doe.
general
blumenthal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case,
general
blumenthal,
we're
not
talking
about
ex
post
facto.
we're
just
talking
about
due
process
of
some
sort
because
the
second
circuit
said
this
couldn't
be
applied
whether
it
was
done
afterwards
or
before.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
blumenthal.
mr....
general
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
it
says
on
the
registry
or
on
the
internet?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
olson.
ms.
sadin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you
state
that
as
a
fact,
ms.
sadin.
what
is
the...
what
is
the
record
support
for
that
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
asking
you...
ms.
sadin,
i'm
asking
you
what
is
the
record
support
for
the
statement
you
just
made?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
that
the
public
knows
that...
what...
that
they're...
that
they're
dangerous.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
also
say
that
it...
it...
they're
not
saying
that
anyone
is
dangerous
on
that
same
website,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
isn't
that
good
enough?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can...
can
a
truthful
statement
be
stigmatizing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
do
you
agree
that
a
truthful
statement
cannot
be
stigmatizing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
consistent
with
paul
versus
davis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
sadin,
i
don't
know
if
the
fbi
does
it
anymore.
i
think
they
used
to
put
out
a
10
most
wanted
list
of
the
most
dangerous
offenders.
now,
could
one
of
the
people
on
that
list
have
demanded
a
hearing
to
say
he
didn't
belong
on
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no,
but
he...
he's
going
to
have
to
be
on
the
watch
for
police.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if...
what
if
it
were
a
conviction,
ms.
sadin,
he
had
been
convicted,
and
instead
of
this
program,
it
specified
that
he
would
be
on
parole
for
15
years
with
much
the
same
restrictions?
would
that
make
it
any
different?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i...
i
know
it's
a
different
question
or
i
wouldn't
have
asked
you.
but
what--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
i...
what
i
want
to
know
is,
would
you
treat
it
differently
or
would
it
be
the
same?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
sadin.
general
blumenthal,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
blumenthal.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
connecticut
department
of
public
safety
versus
doe.
connecticut
like
every
other
state
has
enacted
a
law
known
as
megan's
law
that
is
designed
to
protect
its
communities
from
sex
offenders
and
to
help
apprehend
repeat
sex
offenders.
the
same
sort
of
law
that
was
involved
in
the
alaska
ex
post
facto
opinion
that
justice
kennedy
announced
earlier.
that
statute
requires
persons
convicted
at
sexual
offenses
to
register
with
the
department
of
public
safety
upon
their
release.
the
department
in
term
must
post
a
registry
containing
offenders'
name,
addresses,
photographs
and
descriptions
on
an
internet
website.
respondent
is
a
convicted
sex
offender
who
is
subject
to
the
connecticut
statute;
he
filed
an
action
claiming
that
the
law
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause.
the
district
court
granted
respondent
summary
judgment
and
permanently
enjoined
the
law's
public
disclosure
provision.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
concluding
that
the
due
process
clause
entitles
respondent
to
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
he
is
likely
to
be
currently
dangerous.
because
connecticut
had
not
provided
such
a
hearing,
the
court
enjoined
petitioners
from
disclosing
the
registry
information.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
due
process
clause
does
not
entitle
respondent
to
a
hearing
to
establish
factors
immaterial
under
the
statute.
the
fact
that
he
seeks
to
prove
that
he
is
not
likely
to
be
a
current
dangerous
is
of
no
consequence
under
connecticut's
megan's
law.
as
the
department
website
explains,
the
law's
requirements
turn
on
offender's
conviction
alone,
a
fact
that
a
convicted
offender
has
already
had
a
procedurally
safeguarded
opportunities
to
contest.
even
if
respondent
could
prove
that
he
is
not
likely
to
be
currently
dangerous,
connecticut
has
decided
that
the
registry
information
of
all
sex
offenders,
currently
dangerous
or
not,
must
be
publicly
disclosed.
unless
respondent
can
show
that
that
subtantive
rule
of
law
is
defective,
any
hearing
on
current
dangerous
list
is
a
bootless
exercise.
it
maybe
that
respondent's
claim
is
actually
a
substantive
challenge
to
the
statute
recast
in
procedural
due
process'
terms.
nonetheless,
the
respondent
expressly
disavows
any
reliance
on
the
substantive
component
of
the
fouteenth
amendment's
protection
and
maintains
as
he
did
below
that
his
challenge
is
strictly
a
procedural
one.
but
states
are
not
barred
by
principles
of
procedural
due
process
from
drawing
such
classification.
such
claims
must
ultimately
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
substantive
not
procedural
due
process.
because
the
question
is
not
properly
before
us,
we
express
no
opinion
as
to
whether
connecticut's
megan's
law
violates
principles
of
substantive
due
process.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
souter
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined;
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
