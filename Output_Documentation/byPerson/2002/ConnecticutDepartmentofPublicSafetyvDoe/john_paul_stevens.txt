john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
system?
last
year
we
had
a
case
that
came,
i
think,
from
kansas,
mckune,
involving
whether
a
person
had
to...
could
be,
in
effect,
compelled
to
go
into
a
sex
offender
program.
does
your...
and
that...
presumably
the...
those
treatment
programs
do
some
good
in
preventing
recidivism.
does...
does
your
reporting
system
give
the
convicted
offender
a
chance
to
differentiate
between
whether
he
went
through
such
a
program
and
one
who
did
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
draw
any
distinction
between
those
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
treat
one
who
had
treatment
and
one
who
had
no
treatment
exactly
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
olson,
can
i
ask
you
a
broader
question?
do
you
think
it
would
be
permissible
for
connecticut
to
require
every
person
in
the
category
to
wear
a
badge
that
recited
the
information
that
goes
on
the
internet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
general
olson,
suppose
you
look
at
it
as
a
stigma
minus.
what
about
the
hypothetical
i
asked
earlier
about
somebody
who
took...
a
convicted
felon
who
took
the...
the
treatment
program
and
survived
it
and
one
who
did
not?
they're
treated
alike
in
this
system.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's...
it's
incomplete
information
as
to
some.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
the
statute
work
with
somebody
who
changes
his
name?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
the
statute
work
with
someone
who
changes
his
name?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
change
your
address.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
you
change
your
name?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i...
but
if
you
change
your
appearance
by
shaving
off
your
beard
or
something
like
that,
do
they
require
reporting
of
that?
