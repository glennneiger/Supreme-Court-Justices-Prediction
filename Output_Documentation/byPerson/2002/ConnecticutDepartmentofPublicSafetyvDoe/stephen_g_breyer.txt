justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
on
my
list
here.
what
it
says
here...
i
mean,
maybe
i'm
wrong
in
the
statute
which
my
law
clerk
looked
up.
she's
usually
right.
and
it's
that
you...
you
get
into
the
exceptions.
you
go
back
to
the
sentencing
court
if
you
committed
the
sexual
intercourse
when
you
were
under
the
age
of
19
with
a
victim
between
13
to
16
and
you
were
2
years
older.
so
i
think
that...
that
justice
souter's
hypothetical
was
purposely
created--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
they
didn't
fit
within
that
exception.
and...
and
i...
i
suspect
that
we
can
find
a
large
number
of
people
who
would
be
convicted
of
statutory
rape
who
don't
fit
within
this
exception
and
who
are,
therefore,
thrown
in.
and
i
think
the
point
of
his
question...
it
would...
certainly
would
be
mine...
is
what
about
those
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
not...
that's
not...
i
think
what
i
took
the
chief
justice
is
asking...
i
took...
and
i'd
have
a
similar
question,
that...
that
their
response
i
think
to
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
with
justice
souter,
that
maybe
this
is
overly
broad
because
let's
imagine
the
19-year-old
who
simply
had
intercourse
once
with
a
much
younger
woman
and
obviously
is
no
danger.
their
response
is,
first,
it
says
to
the
public,
consider
every
case
on
the
merits.
we're
not
saying
whether
it's
dangerous
or
not.
second,
when
the
people
in
the
neighborhood
to
which
the
individual
has
moved
look
him
up
on
the
net,
they'll
see
what
he
did,
and
people
aren't
idiots.
they'll
understand
that
this
is
there
because
he
fell
within
the
law.
and
besides
that,
they
say,
it's
too
difficult
for
us
to
draw
finer
lines.
at
least
the
legislature
reasonably
so
could
conclude.
so
the
question
i
had
is,
is
there
any
objective
evidence
that
people
do
cause
mistake...
the
significance
of
this
19
or
20-year-old
boy
having
his
name
there?
are
we
just
doing
that
because
we
all
know...
in
quotes...
or
is
there
evidence
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let...
let
me
give
you
that.
what's
bothering
me...
and
it
may
be
i'm
just
missing
something,
but
if
i
am,
i've
missed
it
for
a
long,
long
time.
what
has
this
to
do
with
the
procedural
due
process
claim?
i'll...
i'll
say
that
my
reason
for
doubting
that
it
does
is
first
there
is...
there
are
some
laws
that
are
so
basic
that
they're
not
written
anywhere,
not
even
in
our
cases.
what
i
used
to
say
was
one
of
them
is
you
don't
ever
have
to
have
a
hearing
if
there's
nothing
to
have
a
hearing
about.
and
here
there's
nothing
to
have
a
hearing
about
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned.
these
people
concede
they
were
convicted
of
sexually
violent
offenses.
to
make
the
same
point
differently,
give
your
clients
all
the
procedures
they
want,
every
procedure
in
the
world,
and
let's
suppose
they
prove
they're
absolutely
not
dangerous.
still,
they
were
convicted
of
a
sexually
violent
offense.
so
it
wasn't
the
lack
of
procedure
that
caused
the
problem.
it
was
the
fact
that
in
your
view
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
does
not
permit
the
state
of
connecticut
to
turn
these
consequences
upon
being
a
sexually
violent
offender.
that's
a
different
argument,
and
the
only
kind
of
clause
i've
ever
seen
that
would
make
that
constitutionally
impermissible
is
the
due
process
clause
in
its
substantive
sense.
and
my
point
is
not
simply
a
technical
point,
for
if
you
had
focused
on
the
argument,
there
would
be
a
record
that
would
answer
questions
like
the
chief
justice's.
you
would
have
been
forced
to
create
a
record
that
would
have
gone
into
all
the
state's
reasons
and
what
empirical
data
there
was,
whether
this
was
justified
or
not.
that's
a
long
question.
but
i'd...
it's
at
the
root
of
what's
bothering
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
finding
a
liberty
interest
here.
after
all,
he
has
to
give
dna.
he
has
to
give
his
fingerprints.
that
isn't
my
problem.
i'll
give
you
all
the
liberty
interest
you
want.
my...
i
don't
want
to
repeat
what
i
said.
you
took
it
in
all
right.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
you
have
to
have
an
individual...
i
would...
if
you
were
arguing
the
substantive
due
process
argument,
which
it's
clear
by
now
is
what
i
think
the
right
category
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you'd
have
the
person
who
was
in
justice
souter's
example
and
he
would
come
in
and
say,
it
violates
the
constitution
to
apply
this
statute
to
me.
at
least
give
me
a
hearing.
but
that's
not
who
you're
representing.
you're
representing
a
class
of
people,
including
the...
the
19
most
dangerous
sexual
offenders
in
all
of
connecticut.
and
you're
saying
as
to
them
the
constitution
requires
a
hearing
and
the
state
responds,
what
are
you
talking
about?
first,
they're
very
dangerous.
second,
they've
all
been
convicted
of
crimes.
third,
a
hearing
will
be
a
waste
of
time
as
to
them
and
simply
delay
the
implementation
of
the
statute
and
a
lot
of
other
arguments
besides.
and
anyway...
all
right.
i'm
just
making
up
all
their
arguments,
but
what
is
your
response
as
to
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
being
clear.
i
know
that.
i'm
saying
that
if
they
were
arguing
substance,
those
people
could
make
the
argument
on
their
own.
don't
we
have
to
consider
you
in
terms
of
the
19
worst?
