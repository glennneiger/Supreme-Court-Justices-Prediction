it's

we
don't

mr.
blumenthal,
may
i
ask
you
whether
this
statute
has
helped
in
any
way
in
reducing
sex
crimes
in
connecticut?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
long
was
it
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
not
truthful?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
is
the
constitutional
basis
for
your
argument?
could
we
move
to
that?
i
mean,
you're
here
on
a
constitutional
claim,
and
i'm
not
sure
what
it
is,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
does
some
liberty
interest
and
reputation
survive
the
paul
versus
davis
case?
