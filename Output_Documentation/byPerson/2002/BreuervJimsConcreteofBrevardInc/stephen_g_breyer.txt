justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
reason?
i
mean,
leaving
the
word
out
of
it,
i
mean,
normally
the
background
rule
is...
this
is
an...
case
arising
under
federal
law,
and
the
background
rule
through
removal
is
if
either
party
wants
to
go
into
federal
court,
you
can.
now,
you
say
there's
an
exception
for
this
statute.
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
the
linguistic
point.
i'm
saying
leave
the
linguistic
point
out.
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
reason
would
there
be
that
people
would
want
to
make
an
exception
for
the
statute,
the
normal...
i'm
not
saying
there
is
none.
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
reason
is.
the...
the
normal...
i
would
be
just
repeating
myself.
have
you
got
what
i'm
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
federal,
yes.
give
them
a
choice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
because?
they
can
bring
it
either
place.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
why
congress
would
want
employees
to
have
a
choice,
but
would
not
want
the
defendant
to
have
the
choice
or
bring
it
to
state
court,
unlike
other
federal
statutes
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
yours
might
be
very
persuasive.
they
have
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
have
the
power
to
persuade,
and
they're
knowledgeable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
though
what
he
i
guess
was
driving
at
is
what
the...
in
1938,
the
year
i
was
born,
i'm
in
san
francisco,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
workers
down
in
salinas
putting
artichokes
in
cans.
and
their
employer
perhaps
was
violating
the
law,
so
they
go
into
the
state
court
in
salinas
and
the
employer
runs
up
to
san
francisco.
and
once
he
can
remove
that
case
to
san
francisco,
it's
too
expensive
for
the
employee
to
run
up
there.
and
that
was
why
your
opponent
says
they...
they
wrote
this
statute.
they
used
the
word
maintained,
and
the
administer
who
was
present
at
the
creation,
so
to
speak,
had
followed
that
for
quite
a
long
period
of
time.
now,
you're...
you're
saying
look
at
the
language.
the
language
just
isn't
good
enough.
is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
add
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
on
the
purposive
part.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
might
if
you...
it
might
not
if
you,
in
fact,
did
put
considerable
weight
on
the
knowledgeable
views
of
the...
of
the
administrators
who
were
present
at
that
time
and
the
presence
of
a
good
reason
for
wanting
to
have
achieved
that
result.
i...
i
grant
you,
i
see
problems
with
the
approach
i'm
enunciating,
but...
but
it
wouldn't
necessarily
change
those
other
acts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
meant
to
apply
retroactively
in
1948
to
those
statutes
passed
preceding
1948?
