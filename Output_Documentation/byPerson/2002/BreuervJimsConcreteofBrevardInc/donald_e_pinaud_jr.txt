mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
vitality
and
scope
of
the
rule
of
construction
from
shamrock
oil
that
says
that
the
removal
jurisdiction
to
federal
courts
should
be
narrowly
construed.
as
we
see
it,
the
overarching
question
in
this
case
is,
as
posed
by
respondent,
whether
or
not
the
rule
from
shamrock
oil
applies
to
cases
brought
in
state
court,
but
based
upon
a
federal
question.
we
think
it
has
to
for
three
reasons,
and
i'd
like
to,
if
i
can,
list
them,
and
then
i'll
go
back
and...
and
cover
each
of
them
individually.
first,
respondent
proposes
an
unworkable
distinction
whereby
the...
whereby
shamrock
oil
is
not
to
be
applied
where
a
case
is
brought
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
alone,
but
it
should
be
applied
if
it's
brought
together
with
some
state
law
claims.
secondly,
florida
has
a
right
to
protect
its
citizens.
and
thirdly,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
just...
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
law
of
florida
as
any
act
of
the
florida
legislature
or
any
decision
of
the
florida
courts.
let
me
cover
that
first
point
first,
which
is
the
unworkable
distinction.
respondent
concedes
that
shamrock
oil
would
certainly
apply
in
a
situation
where
a
state
law
claim
was
being
brought
together
with
a
fair
labor
standards
act
claim.
in
this
case
we
did
not
bring
a
state
law
claim.
we
only
brought
a
fair
labor
standards
act
claim.
we
could
have,
but
we
didn't.
if
you
were
to...
if
you
were
to
have
that
rule,
you
would
have
a
situation
where
whether
or
not
federal
jurisdiction
was
proper
would
be
wholly
dependent
upon
whether
a
state
claim
was
brought
with
federal
action.
we
don't
think
that--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--well--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--there
is--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--there
is,
i
think,
no
question
that
the
equal
pay
act
and
the
age
discrimination
act...
age
discrimination
enforcement
act
would
be
covered
by
the
court's
decision
in
this
case
because
the
enforcement
provisions
of
those
statutes
are
tied
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
that
would
be
correct.
the...
the
second
reason
that
i
think
shamrock
oil
applies
in
this
case
is
because
florida
has
a
right
to
protect
its...
its
citizens.
this
is
a
dispute
between
phillip
breuer,
mr.
breuer,
who
is
a
resident
of
the
state
of
florida
who
lives
in
duval
county,
who
works
for
jim's
concrete
of
brevard,
which
is
a
company
in
brevard
county,
in
an
employment
relationship
that
took
place
in
florida,
governed
by
florida
law.
they
worked
in
many
counties
in
florida.
certainly
then
florida
has
an
interest
in
that
relationship
and
in
this
dispute.
this
is
not
a
case
like
asahi
where
you
have
a...
a
california
court
looking
at
a
dispute
between
a...
you
know,
a
taiwanese
company
and
a
japanese
company.
florida
has
an
interest.
the
third
point
is
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
law
of
florida
as
any
decision
of
the
florida
legislature
or
any...
or
any
opinion
of
its
court.
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
laws
of
the
united
states
are
the
laws
of
florida.
florida
courts
have
an
obligation,
an
absolute
duty,
to
enforce
and
uphold
the
fair
labor
standards
act
just
like
they
have
to
enforce
and
uphold
the...
the
fourth
amendment,
the
fifth
amendment,
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it...
it
would
be
unrealistic
to
say
that
florida
has
an
obligation
to
uphold
these
laws,
but
then
has
no
right
or
no
interest
in
having
them
upheld
in...
in
florida
courts.
so
for...
for
those
reasons,
we
think
that
shamrock
oil
certainly
has
to
apply
to
this
case.
if
you
then
go
ahead
and...
and
apply
the
shamrock...
the
shamrock
analysis
to
either
the
expressly
provided
language
of
1441
or
the
maintain
language
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
you
have
to
reach
a
decision
that
these
cases
are...
are
not
properly
to
be
subject
to
removal.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
obviously
it's
our
position
that
maintain
in
this
case
does
mean
that
it
should
remain
in
state
court,
and
we
think
it's
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
the
first
reason
we
would
say
is
that
once
you
apply
the
shamrock
analysis,
maintain
has
to
mean
what
we
say
because
in
the
very
worst-case
scenario,
at
least
for
our
position,
maintain
is
ambiguous
or...
or
capable
of
two
different
constructions.
everybody
here
has
argued...
the
government
argues
and
respondent
argues...
that
it's
ambiguous.
well,
if
it's
ambiguous,
if
it's
capable
of
meaning
you
can
maintain
to
a
conclusion
in
state
court,
or
if
it
is,
rather,
capable
of
meaning
that
you
can
only
really
bring
or
commence
it,
then
under
shamrock
oil,
when
we
apply
that
analysis,
we
should
use
the
conclusion
that
most
limits
removal,
which
would
be
to...
which
would
be
to
say
that
maintain
means
you
continue
on
to...
to
final
judgment.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
justice--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
what
you
have
to
do,
though,
is
i
think
when
looking
at
the
expressly...
expressly
otherwise
provided
language,
you
have
to...
first,
you
have
to
apply
shamrock
oil
to
that
language.
now,
it's...
it's
our
position
that
when
congress
used
the
word
expressly
provided,
otherwise
expressly
provided,
it
meant
it
in
a
textual
sense.
that
is,
the
word
expressly
is
capable
of
two
different
meanings
itself.
it
can
mean
super
clear
or
absolutely
unambiguous,
or
rather,
it
can
mean
grounded
in
some
text.
because
it's
capable
of
two
different
meanings,
we
think
that
when
you
apply
shamrock
to
expressly,
you
choose
the
textual
meaning
because
the
textual
meaning
shrinks
removal
considerably
whereas
the
other
meaning
expands
it.
but
i
think--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--justice
ginsburg,
i...
i
don't
think
that
would
be
the
case.
i...
i
don't
think
that
that's
really
analogous
to
the
situation
of
bringing
it
from
the
state
court
to
the
federal
court.
it's...
it's...
the...
the
forum
choice
i
think
is
significantly
different.
when
the
employee
brings
his
action
in
state
court,
he's
choosing
that
state...
that
state
forum,
and
it's
for
a
reason.
and...
and
we
think
that...
that
those
reasons
are...
are
actually
well
articulated
in...
in
the
government's
1947
brief
when
they
were
actually
supporting
our
position.
so
i...
i
don't
think
it's--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--well,
i
think
then
my...
my
answer
to
that
would
have
to
be
the
rule
from
shamrock
oil
says
if
there's
two
reasonable
interpretations,
we...
we
make
a
decision
that
limits
removal.
i'm
not
sure
it's
reasonable
to
say
that
if
you
bring
it
in
one
federal
court,
it
can't
be
transferred
to...
to
another
federal
court
on...
on
the...
the
concerns
would...
that
would
give
rise
to
it.
if
i
could
go
back,
just
a
moment,
to
what
i
was
talking
about,
the...
the
expressly
provided
language,
addressing
your
question,
justice
scalia.
we
also
think
that
the
expressly
provided
language
has
to
be
the
textual
basis
based
upon
this...
this
court's
construction
of
28
u.s.c.
2283.
that's
the
anti-injunction
statute.
in
that
statute,
congress
has
provided
that
no...
that
no
federal
court
shall
issue
an
injunction
to
enjoin
a
state
court
proceeding
unless
expressly
authorized
by
congress.
we're
dealing
with
expressly
provided
language
in
1441.
we
see
the
language
as
completely
indistinguishable.
in
mitchum
v.
foster,
this
court
construed
that
language
in
2283
as
saying,
look,
that
language
does
not
mean
that
you
have
to
have
a...
a
statute
that
says
you
can
issue
an
injunction.
rather,
what
the
court
said
was,
we
look
at
the
scope...
we
look
at
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
statute
and
say
is
the
purpose
of...
and
intent
of
the
statute
to
allow
an
injunction.
so
really,
what
the
court
is
saying
in...
in
mitchum--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--i...
i
don't
have...
there...
there
is
no
case
that
i
know
of
that
would
be
on
point
in...
in
this
situation,
justice
scalia.
but
i
would
also
add
that
we
do
not...
though
we
think
that
the
first
analysis
should
start
with
shamrock
because...
the
first
analysis
of
maintain
should
start
with
shamrock
because
at
best
everyone...
everyone
agrees
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous
and
that
is...
that
is,
that
the
respondent
and
the
government
would
say,
well,
it
could
mean
this
but
maybe
it
doesn't.
i
don't
think
we
say
that
it's...
that
everything
hangs
or
falls
on
shamrock
necessarily.
if
you
look
at
the
way
maintain
was
used
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
we
think
that
the
word
maintain
is
an
express
prohibition...
prohibition
on
its
own.
this
is
not
just
our
opinion.
this
was
the
opinion
of
the...
of
the
majority
of
judges,
the
majority
of
courts
that
construed
the
statute
prior
to
the
1948
amendment.
it
was
also
the
opinion
of
the
united
states
back
in
1947.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
we
believe
that
the
word
maintain--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--justice
breyer,
i'm
not
exactly
sure
why
we--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--i...
i
think
i
understand
what
you're
saying
now--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--your
honor.
the...
the
reason
why
congress
wanted
an
exception
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
allow
employees
to
bring
these
cases
in...
in
state
court--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--well--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--well,
they
can...
they
can
bring
it
in...
in
either
place.
i
mean,
there
would
be
no
reason
why
congress--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--because
in
1938,
when
this
statute
was
passed,
it
was
difficult
for
many
employees
around
the
country
to...
to
effectively
vindicate
their
rights
for
unpaid
overtime
if
they
had
to
go
to
federal
court.
this
is--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--justice
ginsburg,
i...
there
are
certainly
cases...
certainly
statutes
where
congress
has
said
this
is
not
removable.
we
don't
think
that
congress
is
to
be
held
to
a
standard
where
they
have
to
use
magic
language
in
order
to
prohibit
removal.
we
think
that
the...
the
real
analysis
should
be
what
was
congress
intending
by
the
statute
at
issue
or
else
you--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure.
i...
i
will
say
this.
before
1948,
you
know,
congress
had
used
language
in
other
statutes
that
said
you
can't
remove
it,
and...
and
we
recognize
that.
but
if
you...
if
you
hold
congress
to
this
magic
language
statute,
then...
then
nothing
they
could
do
or
nothing
they
could
intend
would
matter
unless
they
use
this
specific
language,
and
we're
not
sure
that
that's
what
the
standard
should
be.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
well...
i'm
sorry.
the...
the
reviser's
notes
to
the...
the
1948
revisions
are
rather
meticulous.
they
talk
about
everything
they're
accomplishing
and
what
they're
trying
to
do.
i...
i
think
it's
noteworthy
that
with
all
the
changes
that
were
made
to
the
other
sections,
like
section
(c),
the
other
subsections,
that
in
order
to
accept
the
proposition
proposed
by
respondent,
you
would
have
to
conclude
that
congress
throughout,
with
these
other
sections
of
1441,
certainly
intended
to
contract
removal,
but
yet
with
1441(a),
it
grossly
expanded
removal.
i
mean,
this
is
a
time
now
where
fair
labor
standards
act
cases
were
generally
considered
to
be
not
removable.
that
was
the
prevailing
opinion.
there's
no
mention
in
the...
in
the
reviser's
note
or
any
of
the
history
to
the
statute
that...
that
congress
even
thought
about
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
so
i
think
the
more
realistic
assumption
in
the
enaction
of...
of
that
legislation
was
that
congress
accepted
the...
the
prevailing
opinion
which
was
that
maintain
was
good
enough,
that
maintain
was
an
express
prohibition
against
removal.
the...
when
you're
looking
at
the
word
maintain,
also
i
think
it's
to
see
obviously
the...
the
public
policy
concerns
that
i
was
just
addressing
with
justice
breyer,
but
we
do
think
it's
important,
as
did
the
government
back
in
1947,
that
in
enacting
this
legislation,
as
it
was...
originally
appeared
back
when
it
was
passed,
congress
used
the
maintain
within
38
words
in
the
same
sentence.
congress
said
an
action
may
be
maintained
in
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
and
then
38
words
later,
it
said
it
may
be
maintained
by
an
agent
or
representative
of
the
employee.
if
you
were
to...
if
you
were
to
assume
that
maintained
does
not
mean
what
this
court
essentially
has
said
it
meant
in
the
george
moore
and
smallwood
cases...
and
that
is
that
maintain
means
to...
to
continue
on...
to
continue
or
uphold,
continue
on
foot
a
suit
already
commenced--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--well,
the
way
i
think
we
look
at
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
certainly
congress
could
not
have
meant
by
saying
it
could
be
maintained
by
an
agent
of
an
employee
that
he
can
file
it,
bring
it,
and
then
somehow
have
the
case
ripped
from
his
control.
that
is
why
we
think
that
if
you--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--oh,
no.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
that...
that's
not
what
i
mean.
i
don't...
i'm
talking
about
when...
when
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
originally
enacted...
it...
it
no
longer
appears
with
this
language.
when
it
was
originally
enacted,
it
said,
an
action
under
this
section
may
be
maintained
in
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
which
we
all
agree
is...
includes
a
state
court.
and
it
also
said
in
the
same
sentence
that
that
action
can
be
maintained
by
an
agent
or
representative
of
the
employee
so
that
he
didn't
have
to
do
it
himself.
somebody
else
could
do
it
for
him.
and
the
point
that
we're
making
is
certainly
when
congress
said
that
that
other
person
can
maintain
it,
they
didn't
mean
that
that
person
could
start
the
case
and
then
have
the
case
ripped
from
him
and
have
somebody
else
take
it
over.
so
if
you...
if
you--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--well,
that's
exactly
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
if...
if
you
were
to
accept
the
argument
proposed
by
respondent,
you
would
have
to
accept
that
the...
the
agent
or
representative
of
the
employee
in
1938
could
file
the
case,
but
then
after
he
filed
it,
somebody
else
or
someone
would
have
the
authority
to
divest
him
of
his
right
to
prosecute
it.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
no.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
i'm--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--no.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
i
am
talking
about
what
could
the
word...
i...
i
was
responding
to
a...
a
question
by
justice
ginsburg
about
the
definition
and...
and
so
forth
of
maintain.
and
the
point
i
was
making
is
that
maintain
has
to
mean
more
than
simply
start
or
bring
or
something
like
that
just
because,
if
for
no
other
reason...
if
you
put
aside
shamrock
and
you
put
aside
the
policy
arguments,
for
no
other
reason
that
congress
in
this
statute,
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
when
it
enacted
it,
used
the
maintain
twice,
one
to
mean
you
can
maintain
the
suit
and
one
to
mean
that
a
person
can
maintain
it
for
you
on
your
behalf.
and
obviously,
if
congress
is
going
to
give
the
employee
the
right
to
have
an
agent
maintain
the
suit
for
him
or
her,
certainly
they
didn't
mean
you
can
just
bring
it
and
then
somehow,
not
for
removal
purposes,
but
you
won't
have
the
authority
any
more
to
prosecute
it.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
well,
i...
that's...
i
suppose
that
would
probably
be
the...
be
the
case,
but
i...
i
think
that's...
i
think
that's
more...
that's
more
akin
to
dismissal.
i
mean,
if
an
employee
brings
a
case
in
state
court
and
brings
a
case
in
federal
court,
i
mean,
they
can
always...
they
wouldn't
be
maintaining
it
if
they
themselves
choose
to...
to
abandon
it.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
but
that
would
be
the
employee's
decision.
that
would
be
no
different
than
saying
an
employee
can
maintain
the
case
in
state
court
when--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
the
employee
could
wrench
it
from
him
just
as
the
employee
who
was
maintaining
his
suit
could
choose
to
dismiss
it.
i
mean,
the
employee
controls
the
suit.
i
think
it's
more
analogous
to
the...
to
the
employee's
power--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--well,
if
the...
the
point
i...
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
if
this
representative
is
maintaining
the
suit
for
the
employee,
if
it
only
means
bring,
then
one
could
conceivably
fashion
reasons
why
that
person
wouldn't
have
a...
would
not
be
able
to
continue
on
foot
that
suit
aside
from
the
employee.
i...
i
know
we're
kind
of
dealing
with...
with
the
semantics
of
the
word,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
show
that
the
word
means
more
than
just
bring
or
commence.
at
this
same
time
also...
and
we've
cited
the
statutes
in
our
brief...
the...
the
government
passed
a
whole
host
of
laws
where
they
used
words
like
bring
and
commence.
why
choose
the
word
maintain
if
it
doesn't
mean
something...
something
more
in...
in
this
case?
also...
and
i
know
i've
mentioned
this
a
couple
times...
the
word
maintain
itself...
it
was
the
prevailing
opinion
back
then,
before
1948,
that
maintain
was
express.
that
is
the
exact
language
that
the
government
used
in
its
brief
filed
in
the
johnson
case,
that
this
was
an
express
prohibition
against
removal.
so
these
are
the
people
that
lived
contemporaneous
at
the
time,
that
understood
the...
the
public
policy
arguments
of
it,
that
understood
the...
the
semantics
of
it,
that
understood
presumably
the
intent
of
it.
and
we
think
that
that...
those
are
entitled
to
some
weight.
there's...
you
know,
there
is
another
argument
that
is
addressed
by
respondent
that,
you
know,
state
court
judges
are...
are
not
competent
to
handle
these...
these
kind
of
things.
or
i
shouldn't
say
competent,
but
they're
not
experienced
enough
to
handle
it
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
we
don't
think
that
that's
realistic.
state
courts
handle
matters
of
federal
jurisdiction
all
the
time.
we
depend
upon
state
courts
to
interpret
the
constitution
and
properly
apply
the
fourth,
fifth,
other
amendments.
there's
no
reason
why
they...
they
can't
handle
fair
labor
standards
act
cases,
and
they
handle
them
all
the
time.
we
filed
many...
we
have
brought
many
fair
labor
standards
act
cases.
most
are
removed
to
federal
court
because
removing
to
federal
court
makes
the
case
take
a
lot
longer.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
i
agree.
i
don't
think
removal
means
that
the
state
court
is
incompetent.
i...
i
was
addressing
an
argument
made
that
essentially
that,
well,
state
court
judges
don't
have
enough
experience,
they're
not...
federal
courts
are
better
at
handling
these
things.
i
don't
think
that
that's
fair
nor
realistic.
state
courts
handle
these
matters
all
the
time.
fair
labor
standards
act
cases
are
not
overly
complex.
they're
certainly
not
as
complicated
as
title
vii
cases
which
states
handle
all
the
time
and
handle
their
own
similar
anti-discrimination
cases
all
the
time.
so
there...
there's
just
no...
that
particular
argument
made
by
respondent
we
don't
believe
has
much
import.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
ginsburg,
you
had
asked
respondent
a
question
about
whether
or
not
the...
the
1948
amendments
could
have
in
any
way
been
intended
to...
to
clarify
the
removability
of
fair
labor
standards
act
cases.
and
as...
as
i
think
i
mentioned
earlier,
i...
i
just
wanted
to
add,
i
think
respondent
agreed
with
that.
i
don't
agree
because,
as
i
stated,
if
you
look
through
the
reviser's
notes,
they...
they
are
extraordinarily
meticulous.
they
list
what
they
are
doing
and
why--
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
--oh,
no.
no,
it
did
not.
it
certainly
did
not.
and
i...
i
think
that
is
important.
i...
i
think
also
that
these
public
policy
concerns
that...
that
justice
breyer
was...
was
discussing,
these
are
really
very
important
concerns
that
we
don't
think
should
be
overlooked.
this
is
a
time
where
you
don't
have
an
interstate
highway
system.
you
don't
have
a
whole
lot
of
time...
a
whole
lot
of
lawyers
who
want
to
practice
in
federal
court
or
who
can
practice
in
federal
court.
there
were
claims
at
the
time
for
as
low
as...
as
low
as
$11.
even
the
cases
today,
when
they're
individually
brought,
they're
not
typically
enormous
cases.
these
are...
these
are
employees
suing
for
their
wages,
trying
to
have
an
opportunity
to...
to
collect
them
without
it
being
inordinately
long
or
inordinately
impractical.
nobody
is
going
to
take
a
case
for
$11
or
$250.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
not
that
we
know
of,
but
it's
our
position
that
that
would
be
because
congress,
at
the
time
it
passed
this
law,
believed
it
was
express,
that
that
was
the
prevailing
opinion,
and
that
even
now
that
was
still
the
opinion
of
about
half
of...
about
half
of
the
courts,
half
of...
half
of
the
district
courts.
you
know,
this
is...
district
courts
every
day...
in
fact,
after
this...
i
think
just
before
this
court
granted
certiorari,
there
was
a
district
court
in...
in
texas
that
said,
absolutely
these
cases
need
to
be
staying
in
state
court.
so
i
think
congress
didn't
get...
i
don't
know
why
congress
didn't
get
involved
in
it,
but
i
would
think
it
would
be
because
they
thought
maintained
was
express
enough,
that
maintain
was
good
enough.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
donald
e.
pinaud,
jr.
thank
you.
