we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
02-337,
phillip
t.
breuer
versus
jim's
concrete
of
brevard.
mr.
pinaud.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
one
can
certainly
maintain
an
action
in
the
florida
courts,
and
unless
it's
removed,
it
will
continue
there.
i...
i...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
using
the
word
maintain
means
that
the
action
must
necessarily
remain
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--when...
when
you
say
that
the...
the
provision
said
it
could
be
maintained
by
an
employee,
that
sounds
more
like
a
synonym
for
brought
by
the
agent
of
the
employee,
that
the
action
could
be
brought
an
agent
of
the
employee,
which
of
course
does
not
help
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that...
that's
the
case
in
any
case
of
a
federal
statute
covered
by
the
removal
statute
unless...
unless
congress
says
otherwise.
i
mean,
to
say
it's
ripped
from
his
control
by
being
removed,
that
happens
all
the
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ripped
from
him
in
what
manner?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are...
are
you
talking
about
removal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you...
you...
when--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
say
ripped
from
him,
you're
not
talking
about
the
effect
of
removal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
you
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
fine,
mr.
pinaud.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hament.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
you
talking
about
the
anti-injunction
act
or
the
anti-removal
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hament.
ms.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice

you,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
pinaud,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pinaud.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court,
in
no.
