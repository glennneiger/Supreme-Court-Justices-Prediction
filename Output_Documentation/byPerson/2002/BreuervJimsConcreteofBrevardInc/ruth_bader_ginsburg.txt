justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
are
unworkable
aspects
to
your
position,
mr.
pinaud.
for
example,
a
title
vii
case
combined
with
an
equal
pay
case,
the
equal
pay
case
could
not
be
removed,
but
the
title
vii
case
could,
and
then
you
would
split
what
is
essentially
one
controversy
into
two
parts
because
one
is...
is
not
removable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
equal
pay
would
be
governed
by
the
same
thing
as--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
fair
labor
standards
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
you're
right...
if
you're
right...
the
equal
pay
case
would
have
to
stay
in
the
state
court,
although
the
title
vii
case
could
go
forward
in
the
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
your
reading
of
the
word
maintain...
and
your
whole
case
hangs
on
that
word,
maintain...
suppose
the
case
were
brought
initially
in
a
federal
court,
and
there
were...
there
was
a
motion,
a
1404(a)
transfer
motion,
to
transfer
the
case
from
one
district
court
to
another.
i
take
it
on
your
reading,
1404(a)
couldn't
apply
either
because
you
would
have
to...
if
the
plaintiff
chose
to
maintain
it
in
one
federal
court,
therefore
it
couldn't
be
switched
to
another?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you're
relying
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
maintain
in
any
federal
or
state
court,
any
state
court,
any
federal
court.
so
if
you
are
conceding
that
you
could
transfer
from
one
federal
court
to
another,
then
the
plaintiff's
choice
doesn't
inevitably
prevail.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
pinaud,
that's
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
the
fela,
and...
and
congress
therefore
expressly
provided
that
if
a
railroad
worker
brings
a
case
in
state
court,
it
cannot
be
removed.
and
congress
was
responding
to
the
problem
of
the
person
who
would
find
it
difficult
to
go
to
the
big
city
to
litigate
in
the
federal
court
rather
than
stay
in
the
state
court
close
to
home.
and
so
doesn't
the...
the
fact
that
congress
expressly
provided
that
fela
cases
are
not
removable
cut
against
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but
before
the...
the
19...
what
was
it...
what?
1445...
before
1948,
were
fela
cases
removable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
have
a
string
of
specific
statutes,
and
then
we
have
1445
that
lists
in
a
row
non-removable
actions,
a
catalog
of
actions
that
are
not
removable.
and
this
one
is
left
out.
wouldn't
one
infer
from
that,
well,
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
won't
if
the
employee
that
you're
representing
says,
i
don't
want
you,
i
want
another
representative.
then
you
can
no
longer
maintain
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
he
said,
i...
i
want...
the
employee
says,
i
don't
want
you
as
my
agent.
i
want
somebody
else.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
just
questioning
your...
your
saying
no
one
could...
you
couldn't
wrench
the
case
from
the
agent
because
the
word
maintain
is
used.
well,
of
course,
the
employee
could
wrench
it
from
him
and
give
it
to
somebody
else.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
nobody
else
could
appoint
an
agent.
so
i
can't
see
the
other
wrencher
in
the
picture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
one
would
suggest
that
a
state
court
isn't
competent
to
hear
an
ordinary
tort
case,
an
ordinary
contract
case,
but
if
there's
a
diversity
of
citizenship,
it
can
be
removed
to
the
federal
court.
removal
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
court
is
in...
in
any
respect
incompetent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
wage
and
hour
division
didn't.
in
1947,
it
expressed
the
opinion
that
fair
labor
standards
act
cases
were
not
removable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
then
what
it
did
was
to
clarify
what
was
ambiguous
before,
and
the
clarification
made
it
apparent
that
the
wage
and
hour
division
had
been
wrong?
is
that...
is
that
your
argument?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
any...
in
any
event,
they
clarified--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
they
did
in
1948
so
the
error
of
the
wage
and
hour
division--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--meaning--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
you're
saying
sounds
so
sensible.
why
was
it
that
a
number
of
federal
courts
didn't
get
it,
ms.
blatt?
there
was
quite
a
division
of
authority
on
this
question
and
the
wage
and
hour
division
originally
took
the
other
view.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
ask
whether
they
intended
to.
i
asked
whether
they
did.
i
don't
know
that...
that
congress
paid
any
attention
to
this
particular
johnson
against
butler
brothers
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
ever
a
proposal
made
in
congress
to
give
workers
who
have
flsa
claims
the
same
express
provision
that
is
there
for
railroad
workers?
