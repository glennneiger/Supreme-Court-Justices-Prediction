well,
except...
except
that
you
have
a
later
statute
that
says
that
it's
removable
unless...
unless
it
is
expressly
provided
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
think
something
that
is
ambiguous
expressly
provides
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
just
a
magic
language
case.
i
mean,
i
think
all
it
was
saying
is
you
don't
have
to
use
the...
the
very
words
so
long
as
you
have
clearly
made
that
disposition,
but
i
don't
know
that
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it...
it
stands
for
the
proposition
that
something
has
been
expressly
provided
for
when
there
is
simply
an
ambiguous
provision
that
might
be
interpreted
that
way,
but
then,
on
the
other
hand,
might
not
be
interpreted
that
way,
which
is...
which
is
what
i
think
you
have
to
fairly
say
about
maintain.
i...
i
don't
think
your
maintain
argument
goes
anywhere
unless
you
apply
to
it
the...
the
rule
of
preference
that
you're
urging
upon
us,
that...
that
you
have
to
interpret
it
so
as
to
prevent
removal
rather
than
permit
it.
but
that...
that
preference
is
eliminated
by
the
later
statute
unless
you...
unless
you
interpret
that
expressly
to
mean
that
an
ambiguous
provision
expressly
provides,
and
i
just
find
it
hard...
hard
to
swallow
that.
and
i
just
don't
see
any
of
our
cases
that...
do
you
have
a
case
that
deals
with
what
was
truly
an
ambiguous
provision
and...
and
nonetheless
said
that
it
expressly
provided
for
something?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
do
we
care
what
their
position
is?
this
is
not
a
matter
that's
within
their
administration,
is
it?
do
they
administer
the...
the
removability
of
matters
in...
in
federal
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
know,
their...
their
view
on
that
matter
is...
is
no
more
persuasive
than...
than
yours,
if
may
say
so.
