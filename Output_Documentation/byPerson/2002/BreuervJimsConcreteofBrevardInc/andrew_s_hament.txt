mr.
andrew
s.
hament
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
since
1875,
a
defendant
in
a
civil
action
has
had
a
right
to
remove
a
case
arising
under
federal
law
to
a
u.s.
district
court.
this
right
is
currently
codified
in
28
u.s.c.
1441(a),
which
authorizes
a
civil
action...
the
removal
of
a
civil
action
of
which
the
federal
district
court
has
original
jurisdiction
except
as
otherwise
expressly...
otherwise
expressly
prohibited
by
an
act
of
congress.
the
except
as
otherwise
expressly
provided
language
was
added
in
1948.
the
court
below
correctly
ruled
that
respondent
had
a
right
to
remove
this
case
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
plain
language
of
1441(a)
which
allows
removal
of
a
case
arising
under
federal
law,
such
as
a
fair
labor
standards
act
case,
unless
congress
has
expressly
prohibited
removal.
there
is
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
or
its
legislative
history
which
even
mentions
the
word
removal
much
less
expressly
prohibits
it.
second,
congress
has
explicitly
prohibited
removal
in
a
series
of
enactments,
and
when
it
has
done
so,
it
has
used
very
explicit
language
directly
referring
to
removal.
third,
the
words,
may
be
maintained,
in
any
court...
or
any
federal
or
state
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
identical
to
language
that
congress
has
used
in
other
statutes,
including
the
family
medical
leave
act
and
the
employee
polygraph
protection
act.
if
this
court
were
to
rule
that
removal
is
barred
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
then
this
would
affect
those
statutes.
and
again,
there
is
nothing
in
the
text
of
those
statutes
which
suggests
that
congress
was
attempting
to
prohibit
removal.
the
word
is
not
mentioned
in
the
text
or
the
legislative
history.
when
congress
has
prohibited
removal
in
a
series
of
statutes,
starting
in
1910,
it
has
very
directly
used
the
word
removal,
and
this
has
happened
both
before
and
after
it
enacted
the
fair
labor
standards
act
in
1938.
in
fact,
in
1948,
congress
created
a
section
of
the
28...
title
28
under
section
1445
and
entitled
it
non-removable
actions.
in
1910,
congress
stated
that
certain
railroad...
cases
against
railroads
under
the
federal
employer
liability
act,
fela,
that
actions
arising
under
those
laws
may
not
be
removed...
used
the
words,
may
not
be
removed.
in
1914,
congress
passed
an
enactment
stating
that
certain
actions
against
common
carriers
may
not
be
removed.
in
1933,
they
passed
the
securities
act
and
used
the
words,
shall
not
be
removed.
so
these
laws
were
in
place
using
very
direct
language
when
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
enacted
in
1938.
since
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
enacted,
we
have
examples
of
four
different
laws
that
were
passed
by
congress,
some
in
1441(a),
some
stand
alone,
that
use
the
words,
may
not
be
removed
or
shall
not
be
removed.
the
last
one
was
the
actions
under
the
violence
against
women's
act
of
1994.
so
we
know
from
example
after
example
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
1948
when
it
used
the
words,
except
as
other
expressly
provided.
mr.
andrew
s.
hament
number
one,
justice
ginsburg,
at
this
point
the
department
of
labor
has
changed
their
position,
and
i
think
that's
because
of
the
addition
in
1948
of
the
very
express
standard
that
except
as
otherwise
expressly
provided
by
an
act
of
congress,
this
type
of
case
would
be
removable.
mr.
andrew
s.
hament
no,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
s.
hament
respondent's
relying
on
the
view
of
congress
which
set
forth
a
very
clear
standard
in
1441(a)
that
these
types
of
actions
are
removable
unless
expressly
prohibited,
and
we're
relying
on
congress.
mr.
andrew
s.
hament
our
position
is
that
they
were
never
removable.
mr.
andrew
s.
hament
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
s.
hament
well,
justice
breyer--
mr.
andrew
s.
hament
--yes.
yes.
justice
breyer,
there...
there
is
no
legislative
history
to
support
that
congress
was
intending
to
prohibit
removal
for
that
or
for...
or
for
any
other
reason.
and...
and
yes,
in...
there
are
small
claims
that
are
possible
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
but
there
are
also
very
large
claims,
including
very
large
collective
actions.
if
congress
wanted
to
put
a
limit
on
the
amount
of
claim
that
could
be
brought
in
a
federal
court,
then
congress
could
certainly
do
that,
as
it
has
done
in
other
statutes,
and
as...
as
it
has
also
done
in
limiting
removal
of
certain
cases
based
on
amount.
but
congress
hasn't
chosen
to
do
that.
turning
to
the
point
of
the
effect
of
a
ruling
that
these
words,
may
be
maintained,
could
bar
removal
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
as
mentioned
and
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
concedes,
this
would
also
prohibit
removal
under
the
family
medical
leave
act,
the
employee
polygraph
protection
act--
mr.
andrew
s.
hament
--i...
i
think
the
problem
would
be
that
the
court
would
have
to...
to
eliminate
from
1441(a)
the
expressly
provided
otherwise
language
to...
to
achieve
that
result.
mr.
andrew
s.
hament
i
believe...
i
believe
it
was.
if
you
look
at
the
timing
of
the
addition
of
that
language
in
1948,
at
that
time,
the
right
to
remove
didn't
have
the
expressly
provided
otherwise
exception.
it
just
was
a
right
to
remove,
and
it
was
at
that
time
codified
in
28
u.s.c.,
section
71,
which
had
the
right
to
remove.
but
coupled
in
that
same
paragraph
were
two
examples
of
cases
where
congress
said
there
was
no
right
to
remove,
the
fela
action
and
the
action
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
dealing
with
loss
of...
or
injury
under
certain
actions
against
common
carriers.
so
right
in
the
same
paragraph
was
this
language,
may
not
remove
these
two
types
of
cases.
when
they
reorganized,
they
moved
that
language
to
1440...
1441...
1445
and
i
think
they
were
just
making
clear,
when
they
left
the
right
to
remove,
that
they
may
from
time
to
time,
as
they
have,
expressly
prohibit
removal
of
certain
actions.
so
i...
i
think
the...
the
addition
of
that
language
changed
nothing.
it
is
just
simply
adopting
what
the
congress
had
already
applied
as
a
standard.
mr.
andrew
s.
hament
i
would
be
a
little
disingenuous
if
i
said
i
think
that
congress
had
looked
to
the
wage
and
hour
brief
or
the
johnson
decision
in
doing
that.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
did
and
my
guess
is--
mr.
andrew
s.
hament
--right.
mr.
andrew
s.
hament
to
the
extent
they--
mr.
andrew
s.
hament
--considered
it,
they
overruled
it
because
johnson
in
that
case,
although
it
reached
the
rule
that...
that
there
was
no
removal
by
implication,
said
repeatedly
in
the
decision
that
congress
was
not
clear
in
expressing
its
intent.
so
to
the
extent
that
congress
was
paying
attention
to
johnson,
it
overruled
it
with
the
expressly
provided
other
language
in
1948.
if
removal
were
barred
in
this
case,
just
to
finish
on
the
point
of
the
effect
on
these
other
laws,
you
could
have
a
very
problematic
situation,
which
i'm
sure
congress
never
intended,
of
having,
for
example,
an
age
discrimination
case
which
would
not
be
removable
under
the
adea,
but
a
race
discrimination
case
under
title
vii
that
is
removable,
or
a
handicap
or
disability
discrimination
case
under
the
american
with
disabilities
act
which
would
be
removable.
you'd
have
erisa
claims
which
would
be
removable,
but
not
claims
for
leave
benefits
under
the
family
medical
leave
act.
you'd
have
a
title
vii
sex
discrimination
claim
due
to
unequal
pay
that
would
be
removable,
but
not
an
equal
pay
act
case
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and
again,
there's
no
indication
that
congress,
in
using
the
words,
may
be
maintained...
it
simply
confers
right
of
action...
would
have
ever
intended
this
effect.
finally,
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
address
petitioner's
argument
in
the
reply
brief
dealing
with
mitchum
v.
foster.
they're
arguing
that
there's
similar
language
in
the
anti-injunction
statute
which
says
that
except
as
expressly
authorized,
a
state
court
injunction...
a...
a
federal
court
may
not
enjoin
a
state
court,
and
relies
on
mitchum.
this
reliance
is
misplaced.
first,
the
underlying
law
in
mitchum
was
the
civil
rights
act,
the
42
u.s.c.
1983
action.
and
the
court
determined
that
the
power
to
enjoin
a
state
court
under
that
statute
was
inherent
in
the
necessary
and
indispensable
power
to
remedy
civil
rights
violations.
and
the...
the
right
to
enjoin
state
court
actions
was
absolutely
essential
to
the
purpose
of
1983.
second,
the
court
observed
that
it
had
a
long
history
of
making
exceptions
to
the
anti-removal
statute
without
directly
referring
to
the
anti-removal
statute
or
state
court
injunctions.
and
third,
in--
mr.
andrew
s.
hament
--anti-injunction
statute,
i'm
sorry.
and
third,
in
vendo
company
versus
lektro,
this
court
said
that
the
fact
that
in
mitchum
there
was
no
direct
reference
to
the
anti-injunction
statute
or
staying
state
court
injunctions
was
cured
by
the
fact
that
there
was
relevant
legislative
history.
none
of
those
factors
are
present
here.
obviously,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
does
not
rise
and
fall
on
this
removal
issue.
second,
congress
has
repeatedly
made
exceptions
very
expressly
and
directly
referring
to
removal
when
it
made
an
exception.
and
third,
there
is
no
legislative
history.
for
these
reasons,
the
respondent
respectfully
requests
that
this
court
affirm
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
that
this
case
was
removable.
