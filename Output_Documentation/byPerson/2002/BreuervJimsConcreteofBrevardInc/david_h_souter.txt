justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
petitioner
breuer
sued
his
former
employer,
jim's
concrete
of
brevard,
incorporated
in
a
florida
state
court
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
of
1938.
the
act
provides
that
an
action
may
be
maintained
in
any
federal
or
state
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
jim's
concrete
removed
the
case
to
federal
district
court
under
28
u.s.
code
1441(a)
which
reads
like
this:
"except
as
otherwise
expressly
provided
by
an
act
of
congress,
any
civil
action
brought
in
a
state
court
of
which
the
district
courts
have
original
jurisdiction
may
be
removed
by
the
defendant
to
the
district
court."
after
jim's
concrete
had
removed
the
case
to
the
federal
court,
breuer
sought
an
order
remanning
it
to
state
court.
the
district
court
denied
breuer's
motion
and
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed
finding
that
section
216(b)
did
not
include
the
kind
of
direct
unequivocal
language
required
by
section
1441's
express
removal
provision.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
and
we
now
affirm.
breuer
unquestionably
could
have
begun
his
action
in
the
district
court.
removal
is
thus
prohibited
under
section
1441
only
if
congress
expressly
provided
as
much.
nothing
on
the
face
of
216(b)
looks
like
an
expressed
prohibition
of
removal,
there
being
no
mention
of
removal
or
of
prohibition.
while
section
216(b)
provides
that
an
action
may
be
maintained
in
any
state
court.
the
word
"maintain"
enjoys
a
breadth
of
meaning
that
leaves
its
bearing
on
removal
ambigious
at
best.
"maintain"
in
reference
to
a
legal
action
may
be
read
as
to
bring
or
file
but
maintaining
an
action
may
also
mean
to
continue
to
litigate
as
opposed
to
commencing
an
action.
if
an
ambigious
term
like
maintain
qualified
as
an
expressed
provision
for
section
1441,
then
the
requirement
of
an
express
provision
would
call
for
nothing
more
than
a
mere
provision
pure
and
simple
leaving
the
word
"express"
without
any
consequence
at
all.
the
need
to
make
the
express
exception
requirement
a
serious
one
is
underscored
by
examples
of
indisputable
prohibitions
of
removal
in
a
number
of
other
statutes
which
demonstrate
that
when
congress
wishes
to
give
plaintiffs
an
absolute
choice
of
forum,
it
is
capable
of
doing
so
in
unmistakable
terms.
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
