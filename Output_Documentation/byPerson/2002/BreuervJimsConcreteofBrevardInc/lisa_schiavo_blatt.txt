ms.

thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
general
policy
of
the
removal
statute
is
to
give
the
defendant
the
same
right
as
the
plaintiff
to
have
his
case
heard
in
federal
court.
the
removal
statute
achieves
that
objective
by
permitting
the
defendant
to
remove
an
action
to...
to
federal
court
if
the
plaintiff
could
have
originally
filed
his
suit
there.
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
plaintiff
could
have
filed
this
action
in
federal
court
even
had
the...
even
had
the
defendant
preferred
that
the...
that
a
state
court
adjudicate
the
dispute.
the
policies
underlying
the
removal
statute
are
therefore
served
by
giving
the
defendant
the
same
right
to
insist
upon
a
federal
forum.
now,
the
removal
statute
creates
a
narrow
exception
to
this
policy
when
another
statute
expressly
bars
removal.
and
congress
has
foreclosed
removal
in
a
number
of
statutes
in
direct
and
explicit
terms
by
providing
most
notably
in
section
1445
of
title
28
that,
quote,
a
civil
action
in
any
state
court
may
not
be
removed,
or
in
other
statutes
that
no
case
brought
in
any
state
court
shall
be
removed.
there
is
no
similar
prohibition
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
does
not
address
the
issue
of
removal
at
all.
the
language
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
providing
that
an
action
may
be
maintained
in
any
federal
or
state
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
does
not
expressly
foreclose
removal.
rather,
it
grants
an
employee
a
cause
of
action
over
which
state
and
federal
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
the
language
does
not
purport
to
trump
or
override
generally
applicable
rules
that
affect
the
disposition
of
the
proceeding
such
as
whether
the
action
may
be
stayed
or
transferred
under
other
express
statutory
provisions.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
there
was
division
and
there
still
is
division
today,
but
we
think
that
the
1948
revision
makes
amply
clear
that
what's
required
is
an
express
bar.
and
when
compared
to
the
established
template
of
the
other
statutes
where
congress
has
foreclosed
jurisdiction
in
direct,
unambiguous
terms,
it
makes
clear
that
the...
the
correct
answer
is
that
the
actions
are
subject
to
removal.
and
the
example
i
wanted
to
give
was
about
why
the
word
maintain
doesn't
speak
to
how
the
action
may
be
disposed
of
under
other
provisions
was
a
bankruptcy
petition.
under
federal
law
that
would
operate
to
stay
the
continuation
of
any
judicial
proceeding,
and
a
similar
result
would
hold
true
under
state
and
federal
venue
provisions.
and
we
think
the
same
result
is
true
under
a
federal
removal
legislation.
there's
nothing
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
that
suggests
that
the
plaintiff's
initial
choice
of
a
state
law...
state
court
forum
must
prevail
over
the
defendant's
express
statutory
right
to
remove
an
action
under
section
1441(a),
and
we
think
the
employee's
right
to
sue
accordingly
is
subject
to
removal.
and
the
only
thing
i...
i'd
like
to
address
in
response
to
the
petitioner's
argument
is
this
principle
of
narrow
construction.
we
don't
think
that
principle
applies
for
basically
two
reasons.
and
the
first
is
that
because
there
was
no
dispute
about
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
case,
again
notwithstanding
florida's
interest
in
the
case
or
even
if
the...
had
the
defendant
preferred
the
state
court
forum,
the
plaintiff
could
have
insisted
that
the
federal
court
hear
the
dispute.
and
thus
the
only
relevant
inquiry
is
not
one
of
narrow
interpretation,
but
it's
a
standard
that's
set
forth
on
the...
under
the
plain
terms
of
the
statute
itself,
and
that
is
whether
another
statute
expressly
bars
removal.
and
we
think
for
the
reasons
that
have
been
given,
even
if
one
were
to
apply
a
principle
of
narrow
construction,
it
would
not
be
plausible
to
construe
the
word
maintain
as
an
express
bar
to
removal.
and
for
those
reasons,
we
would
urge
that
this
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
