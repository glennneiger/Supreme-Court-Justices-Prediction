justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
is
that?
let's...
let's
look
at
the
statute
and
talk
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
i
mean,
that's...
that's
one
reading
of
that.
i
mean,
you
could
say...
and
maybe...
maybe
it's
the
more
natural
reading...
that
as
to
the
origin
by
another
person
means
that
some
other
person
originated
it.
but
it
could
mean
as
to
the
origin
by
another
person,
if
i
represent
that
i
originated
it,
okay,
when
in
fact
another
person
originated
it,
i
would
be
making
a
misrepresentation
as
to
the
origin
by
another
person
because
i'm
denying
that
that
other
person
originated
it.
i'm
saying
that
i
did.
wouldn't
that
be
a
misrepresentation
as
to
the
origin
by
another
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
either
it
did
or
did
not.
either
it
did
or
did
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
before
you
get
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when...
when
you
put
your
own
name
on
it,
aren't
you
denying
that
it
was
originated
by
somebody
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
you're
stating
that
it
was
not.
you're
saying
that
it
was
not
originated
by
another
person.
and
that
seems
to
me
it
could
be
interpreted
as
being
a
misrepresentation
as
to
the
origin
by
another
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
put
your
name
on
it,
you're
saying
i
did
it.
nobody
else
did
it.
you...
you
made
a...
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
where...
where
is
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
before
you
go
on,
suppose...
suppose
they
hadn't
edited
the...
the
prior
crusade
in
europe
thing
at
all.
they
had
not
done
anything
to
it,
didn't
have
a...
a
new
introduction,
didn't
have
the
little
snippets
of
addition
that
they
had.
however,
they
did,
indeed,
make
the
copies
and
they...
they
made
the...
the
plastic
cassette
in
which
it
was
inserted
and
so
forth.
would
you
take
the
position
that...
that
they
were
the
origin
of
that...
of
that
product
and
therefore
could
represent
that
it
was
their
product?
justice
antonin
scalia
production
not
in
the
hollywood
sense
of
production.
justice
antonin
scalia
production
in
the
sense
of
i
made
this...
this
physical
article.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
is
there...
is
there
no...
i
understand
you're
saying
i
say
i
produced
this,
all
it
means
is
i
produced
this
physical
object.
but
suppose
in
addition
the
person
says
i
produced
this...
this
physical
object
and,
moreover,
i...
i
produced
the
show
that
is
on
this
physical
object.
that
is,
i'm
using
produced
in
the
hollywood
sense
now.
is
there...
is
there...
when
in
fact
i
didn't.
i
just
did
a
little
bit
and
most
of
it
was
done
by
fox.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
no
remedy
for
that?
because
that's
what
they
say
occurred
here.
they...
they
wouldn't
mind
your
just
saying,
you
know,
i...
i
am
the
maker
of
this
cassette
or
of
this
disk.
they
wouldn't
mind
that.
but...
but
what
happened
was
that
on
the
disk
it
said
i
am
the
artistic
producer
of
this
thing.
that's
what
they're
complaining
about.
now,
is
there
no
remedy
for
that
when
they
weren't?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
isn't
any
general
federal
anti-lying
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
you
could
these
people--
justice
antonin
scalia
or
prevented
him
from...
prevented
them
from
making
a
misattribution.
you
have
to
add
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
still
too
high.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the...
the
issue
is
whether
the
lanham
act
creates
a
cause
of
action
with
respect
to
that
particular
unhappiness.
what
do
you
respond
to
the
contention
that
the
word
origin
in
this
provision
simply
means
who
manufactured
it,
not
whose...
whose
idea
it
was?
and
to
put
it
in...
it
applies
in
a
patent
context
as...
as
well.
you
know
these...
these
vise
grips
that
you
can
have
a
pliers
that
will
hold
on
automatically
until
you
release
it.
suppose
the
patent
has...
has
expired
on
that,
and
i
produce
an
identical
copy
of...
of
the
vise
grip
and
i
sell
it
and
i
say,
you
know,
manufactured
by
scalia.
do
i
have
to
say,
oh,
but
it's
not
my
idea?
i
want
you
to
know
that,
you
know,
mr.
vise
grip
is
the
guy
that...
that
originally
did
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
have
to
say
that,
do
i?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
if
i
say,
and
moreover
it
was
my
original
idea?
would
there
be
a
cause
of
action
under
the
lanham
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
my.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
what
does...
what
does
that
have
to
do
with...
all
right.
i
don't
see
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
have
all
this
trouble
if
they
had
renewed
the
copyright.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
isn't
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
ms.
cendali,
how
far
back
do
you
go?
i
mean,
my
problem
with
your
interpretation
of
the
word
origin...
it
seems
to
me
a
very
good
cut-off
point
means
origin
means
who's
selling
it,
who...
who
produced
the
physical
thing.
now,
you...
you
don't
want
to
limit
it
to
that.
you
want
to
say
it
also
includes
what
the
physical
thing
contains
if
it's
a...
if
it's
an
intellectual
matter.
but
why
do
you
cut
it
off
at
the
last
copyright
owner?
i
mean,
suppose
the
cassette
contained
carmen
jones.
okay?
why...
why...
would
i
have
to
identify
not
only
whoever
was
the
author
of
the
derivative
work,
carmen
jones,
harry
belafonte...
i
don't
know
who
did
it.
would
i
also
have
to
identify
bizet
as...
as
the,
you
know,
the...
the
author
of
the
original
idea,
plus
the
unknown
frenchman
who
wrote
the
novel
from
whom
bizet
got
the...
got
the
idea?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
do
you
arbitrarily
say,
you
know,
you
go
back
to
the
last
copyright
owner?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
you
didn't
have
a
copyright.
and
that
would
apply
even
if
you
had
no
copyright
on
the
product,
just...
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you...
you
would
stand
by
that
for
forward--
justice
antonin
scalia
--causes
of
action--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
well
as...
as
well
as
reverse.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
if
i
sold
a
cassette
that
i
physically
manufactured
and
i
advertised
it
as
being
carmen
jones,
the
original
mgm
production,
and
in
fact
it
was
the
capitol
steps,
there
wouldn't
be
any...
there
wouldn't
be
any
lanham
act
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i'm
saying.
that's
forward
passing
off,
and
you
would
say
that
since
origin
means
what
you
say
it
means,
i've
manufactured
the
piece
of
plastic,
there's
no...
there's
no
cause
of
action
under
the
lanham
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
he
who
says
a
must
say
b,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent,
twentieth
century
fox
acquired
the
television
rights
to
general
dwight
d.
eisenhower's
1948
book
crusade
in
europe,
and
arranged
for
time
incorporated
to
produce
a
television
series
of
the
same
name
which
was
first
broadcast
in
1949.
when
the
copyright
in
the
television
series
expired,
fox
did
not
renew
it
and
the
series
passed
into
the
public
domain.
in
1988,
fox
reacquired
the
television
rights
to
the
book
and
licensed
respondents
sfm
entertainment
and
new
line
home
video
to
sell
crusade
in
europe
on
video.
at
this
point,
enter
petitioner,
dastar.
in
1995,
dastar
released
a
video
set
entitled
world
war
ii
campaigns
in
europe.
to
make
campaigns,
dastar
edited
the
crusade
television
series.
its
advertising
for
the
campaigns
video
set
says
"produced
and
distributed
by
a
dastar
subsidiary"
and
the
screen
credits
state
dastar
corporation
presents
with
no
reference
to
the
crusade
television
series,
the
book,
or
fox.
respondents,
fox,
sfm,
and
new
line
brought
this
action
alleging
as
relevant
here,
that
dastar's
sale
of
campaigns
as
its
own
product
without
credit
to
the
crusade
television
series
or
respondent's
constitutes
reverse
passing
off
in
violation
of
section
43(a)
of
the
lanham
act.
passing
off
or
as
it
is
sometimes
called
palming
off
occurs
when
a
producer
represents
his
own
goods
or
services
as
someone
else's.
so,
it
sells
you
a
cheap
watch
with
the
representation
that
it
is
a
famous
brand.
reverse
passing
off,
as
its
name
suggest,
is
just
the
opposite.
the
producer
misrepresents
someone
else's
goods
or
services
as
his
own.
it
does
not
happen
often
but
the
producer
might
want
you
to
think
that
what
he
is
selling
you
is
his
own
when
in
fact
someone
else
made
it.
anyway,
the
district
court
found
on
this
reverse
passing
off
case
for
the
respondents
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed,
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
the
respondents
argue
that
in
claiming
that
it
produced
campaigns,
dastar
violated
section
43(a)
by
making
a
"false
designation
of
origin
or
false
or
misleading
description
or
representation,"
a
fact
which
"is
likely
to
cause
confusion
as
to
the
origin
of
its
goods"
those
are
the
text
of
the
lanham
act.
that
claim
would
undoubtedly
be
sustained
if
dastar
had
bought
some
of
new
line's
crusade
video
tapes,
the
physical
video
tapes
and
merely
repackaged
them
as
its
own,
but
dastar's
alleged
wrongdoing
is
quite
different,
it
took
a
creative
work
in
the
public
domain,
the
crusade
television
series
copied
it,
made
modifications
arguably
minor
ones,
and
produced
its
very
own
series
of
physical
video
tapes.
thus,
the
question
presented
is
whether
origin
of
goods
in
the
lanham
act
refers
only
to
the
manufacturer
or
producer
of
the
physical
goods
or
whether
it
can
include
as
respondent
suggest
the
author
of
an
underlying
creative
work
that
the
goods
contain.
we
think
the
most
natural
understanding
of
the
phrase
origin
of
goods
is
the
producer
of
the
tangible
product
sold
in
the
marketplace,
in
this
case
the
physical
campaigns
video
set,
and
not
the
person
or
entity
that
originated
the
ideas
or
communication
that
the
goods
themselves
embody
or
contain.
that
normal
meaning
is
in
accord
with
the
purpose
of
the
lanham
act
which
is
primarily
to
protect
consumers
against
misbranding.
a
buyer
of
a
branded
product
believes
that
the
brand
name
company
produced
that
product
but
does
not
automatically
assume
that
the
company
came
up
with
the
idea
for
the
product
or
designed
the
product
and
typically
could
not
care
less
whether
it
did.
it
could
be
argued
that
the
consumer's
expectation
is
different
with
regard
to
what
might
be
called
communicative
products
such
as
books
or
videos
as
opposed
to
normal
products
such
as
hammers.
with
regard
to
the
former,
one
might
say
that
consumer
does
care
about
the
ideas
that
the
physical
products
contain
or
embody,
but
to
accord
special
treatment
to
communicative
products
would
bring
the
lanham
act
into
conflict
with
the
law
of
copyright
which
addresses
specifically
the
protection
of
rights
and
ideas.
the
right
to
copy
and
to
copy
without
attribution
once
a
copyright
has
expired,
like
the
right
to
make
a
product
whose
patent
has
expired
passes
to
the
public.
the
rights
of
the
patentee
or
copyright
holder
we
have
said
are
part
of
a
carefully
crafted
bargain
under
which
in
exchange
for
a
monopoly
limited
in
time.
once
the
patent
or
copyright
monopoly
has
expired,
the
public
may
use
the
invention
or
work
at
will
and
without
attribution.
allowing
the
cause
of
action
under
43(a)
for
dastar's
representation
of
itself
as
the
producer
of
its
videos
would
create
a
species
of
mutant
copyright
law
that
limits
the
public's
federal
right
to
copy
and
use
expired
copyrights.
when
congress
has
wished
to
create
such
an
addition
to
the
law
of
copyright,
it
has
done
so
specifically
as
for
example
in
the
visual
artists
rights
act
which
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
describing.
reading
origin
in
section
43(a)
as
respondents
proposed
would
also
create
serious
practical
problems.
a
video
of
the
mgm
film
carmen
jones,
for
example,
after
its
copyright
has
expired
would
presumably
require
attribution
not
just
to
mgm
but
to
oscar
hammerstein
ii
who
wrote
the
musical
on
which
the
film
was
based,
to
george
bizet
who
wrote
the
opera
on
which
the
musical
was
based,
and
to
prosper
merimee,
who
wrote
the
novel
on
which
the
opera
was
based.
in
many
cases,
figuring
out
who
is
in
the
line
of
origin
would
be
no
simple
task.
indeed,
in
the
present
case,
it
is
far
from
clear
that
the
respondents
have
that
status.
we
do
not
think
that
the
lanham
act
requires
this
search
for
the
source
of
denial
and
all
its
tributaries.
for
these
and
other
reasons
we
hold
that
the
phrase
"origin
of
goods"
in
the
lanham
act
defers
the
producer
of
the
tangible
goods
that
are
offered
for
sale
and
not
to
the
author
of
any
idea,
concept,
or
communications
embodied
in
those
goods.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
breyer,
however,
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
