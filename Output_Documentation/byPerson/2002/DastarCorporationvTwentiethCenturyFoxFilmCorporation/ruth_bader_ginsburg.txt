can
we
go
back
to
your
statement?
as
i...
as
i
understood
it,
it
wasn't
the
omission
of
fox,
but
the
addition
of
your
people.
in
other
words,
it
wasn't
the
failure
to
give
credit
to
respondents,
but
it
was
petitioner's
taking
credit
for
it
that
was
what
the
lower
courts
thought
was
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gerber,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
what
the
lower
court
did
because
i
don't
think
that
you
were
accurate
when
you
said
in
the
view
of
the
lower
court,
this
was
a
non-attribution
case.
i'm
looking
at
page
53,
and
the
court
indeed
does
start
out
by
saying
that
defendants
failed
to
identify
the
series,
but
then
there's
a
semicolon,
and
it
goes
on
to
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
53...
53a
of
the
petition.
i'm
questioning
mr.
gerber's
characterization
that
this
case
is
simply
a
non-attribution
one
because
after
the
semicolon,
it
says
why
that
was
a
problem.
it's...
it
gives
the
false
impression
that
the
series
contains
only
the
work
of
those
listed
in
the
credits.
so
that
was
the
problem
that
was
central
for
the
district
court,
not
simply
a
non-attribution,
but
an
incorrect
attribution.
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
ignore
that
clear
statement
by
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
without
proper
credit
could
mean
improper
credit,
but
when
the
court
is
developing
that
point
in
full,
it
says
there
are
two
things.
it
was
the
failure
to
identify.
why
was
that
a
violation
of
the
lanham
act
in
the
court's
view?
because
it
gave
the
false
impression
that
only
those
listed--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was
an
improper
attribution
case,
not
simply
a
non-attribution
case.
i'm
simply
questioning
your
original
characterization
which
i
do
not
think
pays
attention
to
what
the
district
court,
in
fact,
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
ninth
circuit
had
a
rather
quick,
unpublished
opinion--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
didn't
tell
us
very
much.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre,
before
you
finish,
there
was
a
reference
in
your
brief
that
i
didn't
follow.
it
cropped
up
in
another
brief
too,
and
it
had...
it
was
a
reference
to
the
berne
convention.
could
you...
what
is
the
relevance
of
that
international
treaty
to
this...
to
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
cendali,
could
you
describe
to
us
precisely
what
it
is
that
dastar
could
represent?
it
has
this
cassette
that
it's
selling,
and
you
said
that
they
can't
say
produced
by
dastar
and
not
say
fox.
what
exactly
could
they
say?
you
don't
question
that
they
could
copy
word
for
word
what's
in
the
public
domain.
in
packaging
it,
what
could
they
say?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
haven't
had
time
to
address
the
damages
aspect
of
it,
and
if
you're
right
that
what
went
wrong
here
was
not
the
copying...
they
were
free
to
copy--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then...
and
the
only
thing
that
was
wrong
was
that
they...
the
attribution
of
creator.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
they
get
the
profits
of
dastar
when...
when
all
they
did
wrong...
i
mean,
did...
copying
the
pages,
copying
the
cassettes
was
fine.
it
seems
to
me
to...
to
have
that
large
disgorgement
of
damages
is
a
misfit.
