mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
in
this
case
did
not
make
any
false
designation
as
to
the
origin
of
its
good,
a
videotaped
series
on
world
war
ii,
when
it
put
its
own
label
on
that
good.
petitioner
manufactured
the
good
at
issue
in
this
case,
the
video
series.
it
produced
it
and
it
and
it
distributed
it
to
consumers.
under
this
court's
decisions
interpreting
the
lanham
act
and
under
the
lanham
act
itself,
petitioner
is,
therefore,
the
origin
of
the
good
at
issue
at
this
case
and
is
the
source
of
that
good
in
the
way
that
this
court
has
used
that
term.
in
1990,
congress
addressed
the
question
of
artistic
attribution
and
it
addressed
it
in
the...
in
the
context
of
the
copyright
laws.
and
it--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we...
we
would
take
that
position,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
that...
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
way
this
court
has
consistently
interpreted
the
term
origin,
if
you
look
at
the
wal-mart
case,
the
qualitex
case,
and
going
back
to
the
concurring
decisions
in
the
two
pesos,
which
is
to
refer
to
the
source
of
production
or
manufacture.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
absolutely,
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
and
that's...
of
course,
we
encourage
the
intellectual
property
laws,
and
this
court's
decisions
encourage
firms
to
go
out
and
copy
goods
that
come
into
the
public
domain.
in
the
court's
recent
traffix
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
correct.
the
television--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we
do
think
that
it
could
be
copyrightable
as
a
derivative
work
to
the
extent
that
it's
not
subject
to
copyright
protection.
of
course,
the...
the
original
television
series
was
subject
to
a
copyright,
but
that
copyright
expired
in
1977
because
respondent,
twentieth
century
fox,
failed
to
renew
it.
and
of
course,
if...
if
the
respondent
had
renew
it,
one
suspects
that
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
arguing
about
the...
an
expansive
interpretation
of
the
lanham
act.
now,
congress
has
addressed
the...
the
question
of
artistic
rights
of
attribution.
it
did
so
in
the
context
of
the
copyright
laws,
and
it
did
so
very
carefully.
it
limited...
it
recognized
specific
rights
of
artistic
attribution
in
1990,
but
it
limited
those
rights
to
a
small
class
of
visual
arts,
made
them
personal
to
the
author
of
those
works,
and
limited
the
duration
of
the
life...
limited
the
duration
of
the...
the
rights
to
the
life
of
the
author.
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
a
general
right
of
artistic
attribution
that
is
not
limited
in
time,
that
applies
to
a
work,
an
audiovisual
work,
that
congress
specifically
exempted
from
the
scope
of
its
1990
legislation
and
that
is
not
personal
to
the
author
of
the
work,
which
in
this
case
was
time
inc.
who
initially
produced
the
television
series.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--two
responses.
first,
when
they
labeled
a
good
that
they
manufactured
and
produced
as
their
own
good,
they
didn't
make
any
false
designation
of
origin
within
the
meaning
of
section
(a)(1)(a)
of
the
lanham
act.
now,
as
we've
discussed
in
our
brief,
section
(a)(1)(b)
of
the
lanham
act,
which
the
respondents
in
this
case
have
never
invoked
and
the
courts
below
didn't
address,
isn't
limited
to
false
designations
of
origin.
it
applies
to
false
designations
that
misrepresent
the
nature
or
qualities
or
characteristics
of
a
good.
so
the
second
type
of
description
that
your
honor
characterized
conceivably
could
fall
within
the
scope
of
section
(a)(1)(b),
but
of
course
section
(a)(1)(b)
was
not
raised
in
this
case
and
it's
also
limited
to
the
context
of
commercial
advertising
and
protection.
the
purpose
of
the
lanham
act
and
the
trademark
laws...
and
this
is
made
clear
in
the
definition
of
trademark
that
appears
at
15
u.s.c.
1127,
is
to
ensure
that
firms
identify
and
distinguish
their
goods
in
order
to
prevent
consumer
confusion
as
to
the
source
of
goods.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
there's...
there's
another
source,
justice
scalia,
and
we've
mentioned
in
note
7
of
our
brief,
the
federal
trade
commission
act
gives
the
federal
trade
commission
authority
to
go
out
and
address
deceptive
or
unfair
trade
practices.
but
that
statute
too
isn't
limited
to
false
designations
of
origin.
origin
doesn't
even
appear
in
that...
in
that
statute.
origin
has--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we
haven't
addressed
that
issue,
justice
kennedy,
and...
and
there
is
some
varying
case
law
on
that.
i
think
most
courts
would
probably
answer
that
question
in
the
negative.
most
courts
have
interpreted
section
(a)(1)(b)
to
refer
to
advertising
in
the
print
ad--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
of
course--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--of
course,
advertising
is
often--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--advertising
is
often
associated
with
the
sale
of
products,
but
more
importantly,
(a)(1)(a)
is
addressed...
it's
intended
to
ensure
that
consumers
can
look
at
a
product
and
identify
the
source
of
that
product
so
if
they
do
have
complaints
about
the
product,
they
can
go
to
that
person.
and
notably,
in
this
case,
no
consumer
who
has
ever
purchased
petitioner's
videos
has
registered
any
complaint
along
the
lines
that
your
honor
is
suggesting.
and
if--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--under
section
(a)(1)(b),
that's
correct,
but
i
think
that
the
important
distinction
between
(a)(1)(b)
and
(a)(1)(a)
in
this
case
with
respect
to
origin
is
that...
is
that
(a)(1)(a)
is
limited
to
false
designations
of
origin
or
as
to
sponsorship
or
approval,
and...
and
the
latter
two
elements,
sponsorship
or
approval,
aren't
addressed
in...
in
this
case.
(a)(1)(b)
is
much
broader
and...
and
would
include
the
types
of
other
representations
that
your
honor
is
concerned
about.
and
of
course,
all
this
we
think
goes
back
to
the
notion
that
respondents
seek
artistic
attribution
for
their
product.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
believe
the...
the
copyright
would
cover
the
new
material.
and
of
course,
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i...
i
think
that's
right.
we
haven't
addressed
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--question
in
detail
in
our
brief.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
under
the
derivative
work.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
believe
that
that's
true.
but
we
think
it's
also
important
that
when
a
consumer
buys
the
product
in
this
case,
a
video...
a
package
of
videotapes
on
world
war
ii,
the
consumer
doesn't
purchase
the
intellectual
property
on
those
tapes.
and
that's
the
purpose
of
the
fbi
warning
that
appears
at
the
very
beginning
of...
of
the
tape.
the
consumer
purchases
a
videotape
series
package
and
a
copy
of
that
which
it
can
view
at
home.
nothing
in
the
lanham
act,
which
is
not
an
artistic
credit
statute,
required
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
provide
any
attribution
to
the
true
creator
of
the
television
series
that
petitioner
initially
copied.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
we...
we
think
that...
that's
true
with
respect
to
authorship
because
we
don't
think
authorship
or...
or
the
concept
of
invention
is
covered
by
(a)(1)(a).
and,
of
course,
the
notion
of
attribution
that
respondents
would
urge
this
court
to
adopt
this
case
would
have
to
apply
to
other
types
of
goods
like
the
sign
stand
in
the
traffix
case.
no
one
in
traffix
suggested
that
petitioner
could
go
out
and
reverse
engineer
and
copy
the
sign
stand
which
had
entered
the
public
domain,
but
that
when
it
did
that,
it
had
to
go
and
give
credit
to
marketing
displays,
the
firm
that
initially
had
the...
the
patent
on
that,
or
to
the
original
inventor
himself,
robert
sarkisian.
now--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--may
i
answer
that
question?
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
is
relevant
in
that
it's
an
international
convention
that...
that
covers
copyrights,
but
we
explain
our
brief
it...
we
don't
think
that
it
affects
the
analysis
in
this
case
because
it...
as...
as
the
berne
convention
implementation
act
states,
it
doesn't
expand
or
reduce
existing
rights
under...
under
domestic
law.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you.
