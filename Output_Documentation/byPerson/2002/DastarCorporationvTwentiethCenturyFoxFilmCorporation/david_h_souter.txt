justice
david
h.
souter
may
i...
on
that
score,
may
i
go
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the...
the
possibility
of
copyright
as
derivative
work?
would
that
copyright
cover
not
only
the
new
material,
but
all
the
original
material
that
they
incorporated
in?
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
that
if
they...
if
they
did
that,
if
they
got
that
copyright,
they
then
couldn't
turn
around
and
sue
for
copyright
infringement
when
the
original
crusade
in
europe
was...
was
marketed
by
the
others.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your...
in
that
case
your...
your
understanding
is
that
it's
only
the
new
material
that
would
be
subject
to
copyright.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
it...
i
mean,
why
is
it
lanham
act
rather
than
copyright
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i...
i
realize
that,
but
you
say,
well,
the
copyright
act
is
concerned
with
copying.
it's...
it's
concerned
basically
with...
with
copying
a
certain
intellectual
content.
that's
what's...
that's
what
they're
trying
to
protect.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
lanham
act,
i
thought,
was
not
trying
to
protect
intellectual
content.
it
doesn't
have
to.
there's
another
statute
there.
the
lanham
act,
i
thought,
wanted
to
make
it
clear...
wanted
producers
to
make
it
clear
who
is
at
fault
if
somebody
buys
the
product
and
doesn't
like
it.
there's
no
deception
here
about
that,
is
there?
they
know
they're
going
to
go
to
dastar
and
raise
the
devil
if...
if
they
don't
like
it.
isn't
that
the
point
of
the
lanham
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
they
will
have
somebody
to
talk
to.
dastar
will
say...
i'm
assuming
they
are
honest
people,
and
they
will
say,
well,
yes,
we
did
that.
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
don't
like
the
fact
that
we
copied
this
other
stuff
and
said
it
was
ours?
we're
the
ones
to
blame.
justice
david
h.
souter
dastar
knows
who
to
plagiarize.
justice
david
h.
souter
when...
when
i
see
the
dastar
name,
i'm
getting
good
stuff.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
why
i'm
relying...
yes,
but
i'm
relying
on
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to
me
that
is
just
as
much
a...
a
guarantee
that
they'll
know
who
to
copy
the
next
time,
as
if
they
had
made
it
themselves.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right,
and
they...
and
they
can
go
to...
and
they
can
go
to
dastar
and
raise
the
devil.
they
said,
you
didn't
tell
us
that
you
copied
that
other
thing.
we'll
never
buy
dastar
again.
but
they
know
exactly
who
to
blame.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
who
has
the
cause
of
action?
the
cause
of
action
is
the
other
company.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i...
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
realize.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
certainly...
it
may
be
unfair
competition,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
confusion.
let
me...
may
i
ask
you
a
different
kind
of
question?
i
thought,
in
answer
to
a
question
i
put
to
you
earlier,
that
you
might
be
suggesting...
you
did
not
come
out
and
say
it,
but
i
thought
you
might
be
suggesting
that
there
would
be
a
different
kind
of
analysis,
depending
on
whether
we
were
talking
about
an
object
like
the
sign
on
the
two
springs,
on
the
one
hand,
and
an
object
with
intellectual
content
on
the
other.
you
said
to
me...
i...
i
said,
you
know,
they...
if
they
don't
like
what
they
get,
they
will
know
that
dastar
is
to
blame.
and
your
answer
was,
no,
they
won't
because
they
won't
know
whether
dastar
copied
or
fox
or
fox
copied
dastar.
and
therefore
fox
will
suffer
because
there
is
confusion
and
fox
will
get
hurt.
and...
and
that
seems
to
be
a
distinction
based
on
the
fact
that
you're
buying
intellectual
content
as
opposed
simply
to
buying
a
sign
that
either
stays
up
or
it
doesn't
stay
up.
is...
is
that
an
argument
that...
that
you
would
make?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
that's
important
to
me,
but
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
the
original
producer
is...
is,
in
fact,
going
to
be
hurt
by
the
confusion
because
maybe
the
original
producer
will
be
blamed
for
the
fact
that
there
are
these
two
identical
intellectual
products
on
the
market.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
what
happens
in
the
case...
what
would
happen
in
the
case
in...
in
which
we...
we
start
out
with...
with
fox
marketing
its...
its
series
and
they
call
it
crusade
in
europe,
just...
just
as
they...
they
labeled
the
original
tv
program,
and
dastar
comes
out
with
a...
with
a
series
which
is
identical
to
it,
again,
copyright
has
expired?
dastar
comes
out
with
a
series
that
is
identical
to
it
and
calls
it
war
and
simply
says
at
the
bottom
of...
of
the
cassette,
cassette
manufactured
by
dastar.
is
there
a
lanham
act
violation
then?
there
is
no
claim
that
dastar
produced
anything.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
consumer
would
be
just
as
mad
and...
i
suppose,
and
there
would
be
a
danger
even
in
the
second
case
of
fox
being
blamed
for
the
identity
of
these
two
products.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
in
my
second
example,
they
didn't
falsely
describe
it.
they
just
said,
cassette
produced
by
dastar.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
any
change
in
title
is
therefore
a
deception.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
deception
in
the
sense
that
it's
an
implicit
denial
of
the
identity.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
have
a
minute,
would
you
address
ms.
cendali's
argument
that
there
is
significance
when
a
product
has
intellectual
content
and
there
is
duplication
because
then
the
confusion
may
very
well,
indeed,
redound
to
the...
to
the
original...
to
the
originator
of
the
product?
the
consumer
doesn't
know
who
to
blame,
so
the
originator
of
the
product
may
well
be
hurt.
what
is
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
her...
her
point
is
you
got...
you
got
two
sets
of
videos
out.
one
has
got
dastar
on
it
saying,
in
effect,
it's
ours.
the
other
one
has
got
crusade
in
europe
saying
fox.
the
consumer
is
mad
because
the
consumer
has
both.
the
consumer
doesn't
know
who
to
blame,
so
the
consumer
blames
both.
what's
the
response
to
that
argument?
