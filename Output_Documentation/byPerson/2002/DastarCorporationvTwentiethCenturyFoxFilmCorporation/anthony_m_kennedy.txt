if
i...
if
i
just
read
the...
the
label
on
the
videotape
and
it
says
campaigns
in
europe
and
it's
identical
to
crusades
in
europe,
and
i
want
to
sue
under
(b)
because
i've
just
bought
something
that
duplicated
what
i
bought
last
week,
does
the
label
constitute
commercial
advertising
or
promotion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
(b)
doesn't...
doesn't
help
and
if...
if--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
the
case
i
put,
the...
the
hope
you
hold
out
for
us
under
(b)
isn't...
isn't
very
promising
unless
you're
talking
about
sitting
and
reading
what
comes
on
in...
in--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
the
credits
which
no
one
ever
reads.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm...
i'm
supposing
a
case,
and
i
thought
you
had
indicated
that
(b)
might
cover
it,
but
there
has
to
be
some
advertising
other
than
what's
on...
on
the
label.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
same
point.
why
can't
he
sue
or
you
sue
dastar?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
sue
the
person
you
bought
it
from.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
can
sue...
he
can
sue
them
both
and
find
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
what
you're...
is
what
you're
saying
that
when
you
buy
the
books
or
the
videotape,
you're
buying
it
because
you
think
it's
going
to
be
different
and
you're
disappointed
when
you
find
out
that
it
isn't.
with...
with
traffix
you
know
if
it's
a
sign
that
stands
in
the
wind
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
that
goes
again
to
what
i...
justice
souter's
initial
line
of
questioning.
i...
i
really
think
it's
the
major
problem
in
the
case
for
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
you
do
is
you
sue
the
seller
dastar...
dastar...
for
misrepresenting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
that
fox
is
not
the
injured
person.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
critical
in
the
case
for
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
no
cause
of
action
if
a
commercial
advertising
misrepresents
the
nature
of
the...
of
the
goods?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
disclaimer
or
the
acknowledgement
have
to
be
on
the
package
or
just
in
the
forewords...
or
on
the
film,
just
in
the
screen
credits?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
if
dastar
had
done
what
you
say
they're
required
to
do,
would
it
have
sufficed
if
they
put
the
information
just
on
the
screen
credits,
or
does
it
have
to
be
on
the
package
that
the
consumer
buys?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
and
if
it's
not
on
the
package,
then
there's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--then
there's
a
cause
of
action
even
if
it's
on
the
screen
credits?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
buyer
doesn't...
the
buyer
has
already
bought
it
by
the...
i
mean,
the
screen
credits,
you
know,
you're
going
to
the
refrigerator
or
reading
cert
petitions
or
something.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
one...
no
one
looks
at--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--again,
i...
i'm
bothered.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
this
is
for
the
protection
of
the
consumer
at
all.
i...
i
understand
what
you're
telling
me
about
the
act.
