justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
just
point
out
on
3a,
it...
the
quote...
you
left
out
the
first
clause
i
think.
they...
they
labeled
the...
the
resulting
product
with
a
different
name
and
marketed
it
without
attribution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there
is...
there
is
a
sort
of
an
ambiguity
or
at
least
a
debate
over
what
the
source
is.
i
think
your
traficante...
the...
the
sign
that
stood
up
well
in
the
wind...
what
obligation
did
the...
did
the
second
manufacturer
have
to
say
the
idea
was
somebody
else's?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
why
isn't
it
the
same
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
they
didn't
hold
themselves
out
as
the
people
who
took
all
the
pictures.
a
lot
of
them
were
secondhand
pictures,
you
know,
taken
by
news
photographers
and
all
sorts
of
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't...
i
don't
readily
see
the
difference
between
that
and
the
sign
situation.
the
sign
manufacturer
wants
everybody
to
think
what
a
brilliant
builder
of
signs
he
is.
he
has
a
lot
of
other
models
in
his
catalog.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
ask
what
difference
would
it
make
if
the
person
claiming
the
credit,
instead
of
claiming
for
himself,
said,
developed
by
an
unknown
genius--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--when
he
knows
it
was
developed
by
you?
that
would
be
equally
misleading.
and
would
it
be
covered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
representation
is
not
i
developed
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
developed
it.
what
i...
what
i
represent
is
it
was
developed
by
a
brilliant
third
party
whose
name
i'm
not
going
to
disclose.
would
that
be
also
actionable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
it's
the
same...
it's
the
same
impact
on
you.
it
fails
to
give
you
credit
for
what
you
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
what
does
it
matter
whether
they
take
the
credit
for
themselves
or...
or
for
thomas
edison
or
some
third
party
that
everybody
assumes
really
is
the
genius
here?
it's
false
in
both
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--does
it
have
to
be
a
deliberate
or
could
be
a
mistake?
suppose
the
person
thought
the
third
party
did
it
and
he
was
wrong.
he
said
this
was
really
written
by
william
shakespeare
and
it
was
written
by
joe
smith.
would
that
also
be
actionable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
the
damage
be
exactly
the
same?
you
didn't
get
credit
for
something
you
developed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
can
i
interrupt
with...
with...
you
got
double
profits
in
this
case,
didn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
wasn't
the
theory
of
that
to
deter
new
violations,
which
i
find
strange
when
there's
an
injunction
against
new
violations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
that's
right,
there's
a
duty
to
disclose
the
true
producer
then.
that's
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you're
saying
they
have
a
right
to
know
that,
there
must
be
a
duty
to
disclose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
a
very
lesser
right
than
the
one
you
were
just
describing--
