italians.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
not
a
case
about
copying.
it's
a
case
about
deception.
no
one
is
disputing
that
someone
has
the
right
to
copy
works
when
they're
no
longer
protected
by
copyright
or
patent,
but
as
this
court
has
long
recognized
in
decisions
like
bonita
boats,
sears,
and
compco,
that
doesn't
give
you
the
right
to
create
consumer
confusion
in
how
you
label
such
works.
this,
i
should
correct,
is
not
a
case
about
a
work
that's
actually
in
the
public
domain.
since
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
as
we've
explained
in
our
brief,
we
retried
the
work
for
hire
issue.
the
district
court
once
again
affirmed
her
previous
summary
judgment
decision
that
the
work
was
work
for
hire.
so
the
underlying
book
by
general
eisenhower
is,
in
fact,
still
protected
by
copyright,
though
they
intend
to
appeal.
in
any
case,
here
dastar
violated
the
lanham
act
by
advertising,
packaging,
titling,
and
crediting
crusade
in
europe
in
a
manner
intentionally
designed
to
give
the
false
impression
that
it
was
an
original
product
originally
created
by
it.
and
dastar
knew,
moreover,
that
consumer
confusion
was
likely.
norman
andersen,
dastar's
president,
admitted
that
a
consumer
would
not
be
happy
to
have
purchased
a
copy
of
campaigns
if
he
or
she
already
had
a
copy
of
crusade.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
and
we're
not
urging
that,
but--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--yes,
that
would--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--if...
if
you
hold
yourself
out
falsely--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--if
you
hold
yourself
out
falsely
as
the
inventor
of
a
product
when
you
are
not,
that
creates
liability
under
the
lanham
act.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
well,
the
copyright
act
just
deals
with
copying,
people
making
copies
of
something
and
selling
it.
the
lanham
act
deals
with
deception,
and
that's
what...
that's
what
this
is.
it's
not
just
that
they
made
the
copies,
but
by
crediting
themselves
as
the
creator
of
campaigns
in
europe,
they
were
able
to
jump
start
their
video
business
and
to
be
able
to
then
get
all
the
good
will
associated
with
that
product
and
say,
look,
we
can
make
these
videos--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--that's
right.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
no,
your
honor.
for
one
thing,
if
they
don't
like
the
content
and
they
go
to
dastar,
they'll
have
no
one
to
talk
to.
with
regard
to
the
purposes
of
the
lanham
act,
as
this
court
has
made
clear
in
inwood
and
in
qualitex--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--but--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--but
the
purposes
of
the
lanham
act,
as
this
court
has
made
clear
numerous
occasions,
most...
very
recently
in
qualitex,
is
to
let
consumers
be
able
to
know
when
they're
getting
a
product,
if
they
want
to
get...
if
they
like
it,
they
want
to
get
other
things
from
that
product...
from
that
supplier,
they
can.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
well...
well,
your
honor,
you
just
don't
know
whether
the
next
person
they
plagiarize
is
going
to
be
as
good
as
twentieth
century
fox--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--well,
the
other
problem
with
it,
beyond
the
fact
that
they
are
deprived,
because
you
have
no
idea
whether
the
next
time
they
copy
will
be
as
good
as
the
first
time,
you're
also
depriving
the
consumer
of
the
ability
to
end
up
buying
two
of
the
same
product,
a
very
real
possibility
that
they
would
recognize.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
they
don't
know
who
to
blame
because
if
someone
buys
campaigns
and
crusade,
they
will
not
know
who
cheated
them.
they
will
not
be
able
to
tell.
the
products
are
lodged
with
the
court.
the
court
can
look
at
them.
if
you
bought
them
both,
if
i
bought
my
dad
one
for
christmas
and
another
one
for
him
for
his
birthday,
he's
not
going
to
be
happy
to
find
he
has
2
hours
of
the
same...
two
copies
of
the
same
7-hour
videotape.
and
in
page
205
of
the
record,
it's
clear
that
there
are
7
hours
of
content
in
that.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
you
wouldn't
know
who
to
sue.
and
maybe
he
also
would
think--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--but
it
could
have
been
fox.
he
wouldn't
have
known
who
was
the
one
telling
the
truth.
moreover,
he
also
wouldn't
know...
maybe
he
would
think,
you
know
what?
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
i
don't
know
if
that's...
that's
the...
the
best
way
the
law
should
deal
with
it.
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
though,
about
origin,
there's
nothing
in
the
lanham
act
to
suggest
that
congress
wanted
to
limit
the
word
origin
to
just
the
manufacture
of
a
product.
now,
in
justice
stevens'
concurring
opinion
in
two
pesos,
he
specifically
noted
that
the
term
origin
has
expanded
over
time
from
its
original
roots
as
denoting
geographic
origin,
a
concept
that's
now
in
(a)(1)(b)
of
the
lanham
act,
to
encompass
origin
of
both
source
and
manufacture.
so
just
by
this
court's
own
opinion,
source
is
something
different
from
manufacture.
what
is
source?
going
back
to
justice
o'connor
writing
for
the
court
in
feist,
in
talking
about
origin,
originator,
author,
the
common
reading
of
what--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--absolutely
none.
they
could--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--it's
not
at
all
the
same
case.
but
when
you're...
because
you're
simply
selling
a
physical
product...
if
all
dastar
did
here
was
sell
crusade
in
europe
as
crusade
in
europe,
it
would
be
a
totally
different
case.
but
what
they
did
here
is
they
held
themselves
out
as
the
maker
of
it,
as
the
creator
of
it.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
they
held
themselves
out
by
putting
their
names
and
only
their
names
on
the
credits,
by...
by
having
a
special
thanks
to
the
national
archives
right
before
their
names,
when
they
admitted
they
had
no
contact...
contact
with
the
national
archives
with
regard
to
creating
these
products,
by
putting
only
a
'95
copyright
notice
on
it,
by...
by
listing
only
themselves
as
producers.
the
only
conclusion
one
can
reach--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--but
the
sign
manufacturer...
when
we
deal
with
products,
we
don't
normally
think,
when
you
have
a
product,
that
someone
is
saying
i
invented
this.
we're
accustomed
to
lots
of
people
selling
similar
products.
the
commercial
context
is
very
different.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
well,
you're
right,
your
honor.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
but--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--i
maybe
can
help
you
on
that,
your
honor--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--because...
because
the
lanham
act
does
not
provide
a
cause
of
action
for
consumers.
so
if
you...
if
you
posit
the
idea
that
consumers
need
to...
can
sue
dastar
if
they're
disgruntled,
they
cannot
do
that
under
the
lanham
act.
the
lanham
act
provides...
it's
been
well
recognized
that
there's
only...
there's
no
cause
of
action
for
consumers.
the
only
people
then
who
can
sue--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--no,
your
honor.
there's
been...
if
you
can
look
in
mccarthy,
there's
well-established
case
law.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
the...
that's
right.
the
people
who
can
sue
are
people
such
as...
as
respondents--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--who
are...
who
are...
who
have
had
some
other
company
come
along,
steal
the--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--good
will
of
this
product
and--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--your
honor,
they
had--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--there's...
there's
no
issue
if
they
simply
copied
it
as
crusade
in
europe
and
sold
it
as
crusade
in
europe.
there...
we
would
not
be
here
on
a
lanham
act
cause
of
action.
our
problem
is,
as
we
said
in
our
complaint
at...
at
paragraphs
12
and
22
i
believe,
what
they
did
was
that
they
held
themselves
out
as
the
producers.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
yes,
they
absolutely
can
do
that--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--but
when
you
have
a
case
like
this
which
is
two
courts
have
found
it
was
a
bodily
appropriation.
the
only
things
they
changed
were
to--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--that's
right.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
your
honor,
i...
i
really
don't
think
so
because,
again,
they
could
have
copied.
the
problem
isn't
with
the
copying.
the
problem
was
the
taking
credit
for
themselves.
going
back
to
the
misattribution
point
on
page
21
of
the
cert
petition
and
justice...
judge
cooper's
description
of
her
own
summary
judgment
decision,
she
says,
by
bodily
appropriating
the
crusade
series
and
falsely
identifying
themselves
as
producers
of
campaigns--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--i
think
it's
designed
as
a...
as
a
tool
in
reverse
passing
off
cases
where
you're
dealing
with
products
to
help
assess
how
similar
those...
those
products
are.
to
go
back
to--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--no,
but...
but
what
it's
trying
to
do
is
to
find
a
way
of
getting
at
the
reverse
passing
off
problem.
the
lanham
act
doesn't
provide
a
particular
way
of
establishing
confusion,
deception,
or--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--i
don't
think
it...
there
would
be
liability
for
traffix
under
the
ninth
circuit
test
because
it's
not
just
bodily
appropriation,
but
it's
misattribution.
and
as
i
say,
when
you're
just
simply
saying
i
manufactured
the
product,
you're
not
misattributing
it.
if
dastar
said,
dastar...
i
manufactured
and
distributed
this
product,
that
would
not
be
reverse
passing
off.
they
are
allowed
to
credit
themselves
for
what
they
did.
they
just
cannot
credit
themselves
for
what
they
didn't
do.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
there--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--because--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--it
has
nothing
to
do
with
who
is
the
copyright
owner
or
not.
it's
distinct
from
copyright.
the
issue
is
and
the
only
issue
a
court
needs
to
decide
in
these
cases
is
does
the
person
claiming
a
credit
for
themselves--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--was
that
accurate.
so
if
the
person--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--i'm...
i'm
sorry.
if--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--right.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
but
again,
the
issue
isn't
giving
us
credit.
the...
the
danger
here
is
them
taking
the
credit,
them
taking
it--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--you're...
you're
right.
if...
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying
is
if
someone
mislabels
a
product
in
a
false
way
as
to
what
the
origin
of
that
product
is--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--that
is...
that
i
believe
is
actionable
under
the
lanham
act,
and
i
think
it
should
be.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
copyright
really
has
nothing
to
do
with...
with
this
case.
they're
separate
causes
of
action
for
separate
purposes--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--if
it
was...
if
it
was
a
mistake,
it
may
be
false
or
misleading,
but
there
wouldn't
be
any...
the
damage
is
likely
to
be
very
different
if
there
was
a
mistake.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
but
again,
it's
not
the...
to
go
back,
your
honor,
it's
not
the
giving
us
credit.
it's
simply
the
injury
lies
from
someone
taking
the
credit
for
themselves,
for
a
company
such
as
dastar
with
no
experience
in
the
video
business
to
suddenly
in
3
months,
at
the
investment
of
$4,000,
be
able
to
produce
a
7-hour
video
tape
that
it
can
represent
to
the
world
and
use
to
jump
start
its
video
business
and
sell
150
other
boxed
sets
in
competition
with
our
client.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
well,
yes,
in
part,
in
the
sense
that
certainly
when
someone
buys
a
creative
work
knowing
the
author
is
important
to
the
person.
if
you
like
a
tom
clancy
novel,
you'll
buy
another
tom
clancy
novel.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
yes.
that's
exactly
right.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
there
would
not
be
a
false
designation
of
origin
claim
under
(a)(1)(a).
it's...
because...
because
dastar
is
not
representing
itself
to
be
the...
the
creator.
it's
accurately
just
simply
listing
itself--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--but
there
might...
there
would
be,
however,
i
believe
in
that
scenario
a
claim
under
(a)(1)(b)
of
the
lanham
act
for
falsely
describing
the
nature
of
the
product.
as...
as
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--only...
that
was
true
from
the
purposes
of
origin,
and
i'm
saying
there
wouldn't
be
an
origin
claim.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
but
with
regard
to
the
title,
for
the
reasons
discussed
in
the
second
circuit
cases,
the
new
american
library
cases,
when
someone
comes
up
with
a
creative
work,
and
puts
a
title
on
it,
inherent
in
that
use
is
the
idea
that...
that
this--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--it...
it...
that's
what
those
cases
said,
so
to
the--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--that's
right--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--and
so
therefore,
i
think
that
would
be
a
separate
issue.
and
that's
why
as
consumers,
we
all
know
when
we
look
at
a
book
and
we
check
to
see,
you
know,
if
it
was
the
same
agatha
christie
book
published
under
a
different
title.
and
that's
an
example
where
disclaimers
are
not
very
difficult
for
people
to
deal
with
in...
in
reality,
and
something
that
consumers
all
can
expect.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
probably
the
easiest
thing
for
them
to
have
done
would
have
been
to
have
copied
it
down
to
the
last
iota
of
the
frame
and
simply
called
it
and
said,
manufactured
and
distributed
by
dastar.
that
would
not
have
been
a
problem
under
the
lanham
act
or
the...
or
the
copyright
act
if...
but
for
the
fact
that
the
work
is
not
truly
in
public
domain.
if
they
had
want...
they
could
have
also
said,
new
credits
created
by
dastar.
they
could
have
accurately
credited
themselves
for
that.
they
could
have
chosen
not
to
credit
anybody.
there's
no
requirement
of
credit.
or
they
could
have
given
credit
to
everyone.
they
could
have
listed
the
original
creditors
and
they
could
have...
creators,
and
they
could
have
added
their
name
on
it.
all
of
these
things
they
could
have
done
which
would
have
protected
the
consumer.
the
consumer
would
have
known
what
he
or
she
was
getting
and
also
not
usurped
for
themselves
unjustly
in
an
unjust
enrichment
way
the
good
will
to
which
they
do
not
deserve.
this
is--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
the
misattribution,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
for
several
reasons,
your
honor.
first,
the...
what
they...
the
disgorgement
is
the
normal
remedy
in
cases
like
this
because
it's
very
difficult
to
establish
actual
damages
of...
of
any
type.
the
statute
is
premised
and
works
this
way.
you...
you
establish
your
entitlement
to
profits.
in
other
words,
the
plaintiff
just
simply,
once
they
show
liability,
needs
to
show
what
their...
that
they
are...
what
the
sales
were,
and
then
the
burden
is
on
dastar
to
come
forward
and
establish
what...
what
deductions
should
be
from
that.
deductions
have
included
the
ability
to
argue
apportionment,
that
only
some
of
the
sales
should
be
attributed
to
the
infringement,
for
example.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
yes,
we
did.
the
court
had--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--no,
but...
but
the
issue
here
is
the...
they...
this
was
undisputed.
this
was
the
first
of
150
videos.
and
as
judge
posner
in
the
louis
vuitton
opinion,
discussed
in
our
brief,
discusses
the
enhanced
damages,
and,
in
fact,
damages
of
any
type,
are
particularly
proper
in
cases
such
as
this
where
there's
a
risk
of
surreptitious
infringement.
and
it's
not
easy
to
detect
reverse
passing
off.
you
could
have
easily
have
a
situation
where
someone
would
rather...
a
rational,
economic
actor
would
rather
lose
the
profits
on
a
particular
item
if...
if
they
can
get
their
entire
stream
of...
of
business
going
forward.
this
is
just
such
a
case
because
this
was
their
first
video.
they...
they
were
able
to
use
this
to
get
instant
legitimacy
in
the
video
business,
and
get...
the
injury
to
us
isn't
just
with
regard
to
this
product,
but
the
injury
for
us
is
the
entire
future
diversion
of
sales
that
they've
been
able
to
get
by
suddenly
using
twentieth
century
fox's
work
to
march
into
the
video
business
and
get
profits
time
immemorial.
that
is
why
congress
has
enacted
the
kind
of
damages
provisions
it
has
under
the
lanham
act
which
i
think
are
singularly
suited
for
just
this
type
of
case
where
it's
difficult
to
show
actual
damages
in
any
given
way.
i'll
note,
though,
that
the
court
in
our
case
did
specifically
find
that
we
did
suffer
actual
damages
and
they
did
not
appeal
from
that.
the...
the
record
is...
is
clear
and
they're
bound
with
it,
that
we
lost
sales
and
that
we
also
lost
good
will.
they
have
not
appealed
from
that.
the
court
did
not
quantify
that
in
any
way,
but
the
court
then
went
on
to
award
us
profits
and,
in
her
discretion,
to
award
us
double
profits.
she
was
using
her
discretion.
she
could
have
awarded
treble
profits,
but
she
chose
in
the...
in
the
principles
of
equity
to
make
a
rational
decision
as
befitting
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
i...
she
also
had
the
opportunity,
after
a
damages
trial,
to
see
the
demeanor
in
each
of
everyone
of
the
witnesses
and
to
assess
the
credibility
of
their
various
statements,
and
i'm
sure
she
factored
that
into
her
analysis
as
well.
and
i
think
that
the
award
should
be
upheld
and
we
hope
that
the
court
will
affirm
summary
judgment.
i
note
that
even
though
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
was...
was
short,
given
the
fact
it
was
a
summary
unpublished
opinion,
my
understanding
is
that
this
court
has
de
novo
review
and
has
the
ability,
if
it
so
chooses,
to
affirm
the
district
court's
opinion
on
any
fact
in
the
record.
we
think
that
the
record
amply
supports
the
fact
that
there
was
reverse
passing
off
here.
it
is
a
cause
of
action.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
court
to
ever
suggest
a
reading
of
the
lanham
act
that
reads
reverse
passing
off
out
of
the
lanham
act
the
way
that
the
solicitor
general
and
dastar
urges
here.
i'm
not
aware
of
a
single
court
to
ever
make
that
suggestion.
it
just
doesn't
make
sense
in
light
of
the
plain
language
of
the
lanham
act.
it
doesn't
make
sense
in
light
of
the
fact
that,
as
this
court
again
has
recognized
in
two
pesos,
the
'88
amendments
were
only
designed
to
codify
existing
law.
they
weren't
entitled...
intended
to
make
any
change,
and
there
was
absolutely
no
suggestion
anywhere
that
anyone
ever
thought
that
reverse
passing
off
should
be
eliminated.
it's--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--the
disclaimer...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
well,
i
think
it...
probably
on
the
package
the
consumer
buys
it
should
have
said,
manufactured
and
distributed
by
dastar.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
and--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--no.
i
think
that
if
the
credits...
if
our
credits
are
on
the
inside
and
not
on
the
outside,
they
wouldn't
need
to
put
a
disclaimer
probably
on
the...
on
the
outside.
in
other
words--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--well,
that...
well,
that's
why
the
outer
packaging
has
to
be
correct.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
they
simply
put
on
the
outer
packaging
manufactured
and
distributed
by
dastar,
they
wouldn't
need
to
have
a
disclaimer.
if
on...
if
on
the
inside
they
were
doing
something
different,
or
if
they--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--well,
again,
you
know,
as
this
court
in
qualitex
and
other
decisions
have
said,
a
consumer...
and
colgate-palmolive...
has
the
right
to
know
when
they
buy
something,
even
if
it's
a
capricious
reason,
you
know,
who
they're
getting
it
from
and
they
should
have
the
right
to
base
their
future
purchasing
decisions
based
on
accurate
information.
here
dastar
took
that
right
from
the
consumer.
a
consumer,
if
they
liked
campaigns
in
europe,
they
may
go
out--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--no.
you
would
think
it
could
be,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be.
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
no.
only
that
they
had
the
right
not
to
know
what's
false.
in
other
words,
the
law
could
go
so
far--
ms.
dale
m.
cendali
--i
appreciate
that,
but...
but
at...
at
a
minimum
a
consumer
should
not
have
false
information.
and
again,
as
i
come
back
to
where
i
started,
that's
what
this
is
about.
these
videos
have
been
lodged
with
the
court.
i
invite
the
court
to...
to
look
at
them.
and
you
will
see
how
deceptive
they
are
on
the
inside
and
on
the
outside
and
how
going
back
to
the...
my...
the
father
getting
the...
the
christmas
and
birthday
presents
that
are
identical,
which
is
a
very
real
possibility,
that
is
not
a
happy
situation
for
the
consumer.
congress
put
in
the
competitor
the...
the
private
attorney
general
role
to
stop
it.
and
i
note,
moreover,
that
this
was
very
targeted
act...
misconduct
on
their
part.
before
they
released
campaigns
in
europe,
they
saw
in
a
video
catalog
that
crusade
in
europe
in
a
boxed
set
was
for
sale.
they
didn't
care.
they
targeted
the
competition
and
they
continued.
thank
you.
