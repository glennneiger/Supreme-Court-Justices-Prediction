mr.
david
a.
gerber
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
dastar
discovered
that
an
old
tv
show
made
by
time
inc.
was
in
the
public
domain
because
fox
neglected
to
renew
the
copyright.
dastar
adapted
the
public
domain
show
at
considerable
expense
to
make
it
into
a
war
narrative
as
opposed
to
eisenhower's
story.
dastar's
product
did
not
refer
to
time
inc.
dastar's
product
also
did
not
refer
to
respondents
who
had
their
own
competitive
video
of
the
same
tv
show.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
tv
show.
because
of
the
latter,
that
is,
the
omission
of
credits
to
respondents,
and
the
finding
that
dastar
acted
willfully
in
omitting
those
credits,
the
lower
court
awarded
$1.6
million,
substantially
in
excess
of
the
$850,000
total
gross
of
dastar,
in
order
to
deter
it.
the
lower
courts
departed
from
the
lanham
act
in
a
very
expansionary
way
in
our
view
in
six
separate
dimensions.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
taking
the
lower
courts
in
ascending
order,
on
page
53a
of
the
cert
petition,
the
language
is
that
the
court
finds
that
defendant's
failure
to
identify
the
television
series
and
the
book
is
misleading
to
the
public.
and
then
at
the
ninth
circuit
level,
on
page
3a
of
the
petition,
the
language
is
that
dastar
copied,
et
cetera,
and
marketed
it
without
attribution
to
fox.
neither
court,
justice
ginsburg,
examined
dastar's
credits,
affirmative
credits,
for
accuracy,
for
whether
they
registered
with
the
consumers,
for
misleadingness
or
falsity
in
any
way.
i
would
suggest
that
the
record
indeed
is
that
it
was
the
omission
of
credits
for
their
competitors
that
was,
in
fact,
the
basis
for
the
double
award.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
our
first
and
most
sweeping
point--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--oh,
yes.
that's
a
reference
to
changing
the
title
of
the
work.
the
entire
phrase...
and
pardon
my
truncation
of
it...
on
page
3a
is
that
dastar
copied
substantially
the
entire
crusade
in
europe
series
created
by
twentieth
century
fox,
labeled
the
resulting
product
with
a
different
name,
and
marketed
it
without
attribution.
the
name
dastar
put
on
it,
instead
of
crusade
in
europe,
was
world
war
ii
campaigns
in
europe.
and
you
will,
i
believe,
see
that
in
neither
opinion
does
either
court
take
a
look
at
the
credits
on
dastar's
product
and
conclude
that
they
were
in
any
way
misleading,
nor
does
the
court
examine
them
at
all.
our
first--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--yes,
yes.
the--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--no,
it
isn't.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
our...
our
most
sweeping
statutory
point
is,
while
not
necessary
for
this
opinion
certainly...
this
case,
certainly
would
dispose
of
it,
that
the
current
version
of
the
governing
statute,
lanham
act
43(a)(1)(a),
does
not
recognize
reverse
passing
off
at
all.
the
judicial
interpretations
of
the
lanham
act,
under
which
this
claim
was
born,
were
under
a
prior
version
that
was
substantially
amended
in
1988,
and
while
no
court
has
construed
the
'88
language,
we
think
that
the
natural
and
plain
meaning
of
it
is
that
it
encompasses
only
forward
passing
off.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
forward
passing
off.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
it's
not
football,
your
honor.
[laughter]
it
is
the
standard
type
of
trademark
or
trade
dress
infringement
in
which
the
wrongdoer...
let's
call
it
brand
x...
utilizes
the
mark
rolex...
of
usually
a
well-recognized
company
and
puts
that
mark
on
its
product.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
in
forward
passing
off?
mr.
david
a.
gerber
i...
i--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--if
i
may
first
distinguish
reverse
passing
off
and
then
come
back
to
your
honor's
question.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
reverse
passing
off,
in
contrast,
is
where
brand
x
for
some
reason...
the
commercial
motivation
is
often
hard
to
discern...
gets
a
legitimate
rolex,
removes
the
rolex
name
and
puts
the
brand
x
name
on
it.
instead
of
passing
its
goods
off
as
rolex,
it's
passing
rolex's
goods
off
as
its
own.
i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor,
i--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
both.
our...
our
most
ambitious
argument
is
none
at
all,
and
we
do
have
as
a
less
ambitious
argument
the
second.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
i
don't
believe
so,
from
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
and
let
me--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--yes.
i...
our
view,
which
i
believe
is
shared
by
the
solicitor
general,
is
that
under
the
particular
statute
in
issue
in
this
case,
subsection
(a)(1)(a),
reverse
passing
off
is
a
no.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
it's
on...
it's
on
page
2
of
the
cert
petition.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
and
if
i
may
present
our
most
sweeping
argument,
the
language
in
particular
in
(a)(1)(a)
requires
a
designation
as
to
the
origin,
sponsorship,
or
approval
of
dastar's
goods
by
another
person.
so
that
would
naturally
cover
the
situation
in
which
dastar's
goods
had
the
name
of
another
person
such
as
fox
on
them,
but
it
would
not
cover
the
situation
in
which
dastar's
goods
had
its
own
name
on
them
because
of
the
by
another
person
language.
when
fox's
name
is
on
dastar's
goods...
and
that
is
the
normal
passing
off,
forward
passing
off...
there
is
a
designation
that
fox
sponsored
dastar's
goods
or
approved
it
or
was
the
origin
of
it.
but
you
can--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--i
don't
think...
the...
the
latter
principle
that
your
honor
stated
i
think
would
be
correct,
but
i
would
suggest
that
it's
not
illustrated
by
the
example.
i
think
your
honor
is
perhaps
looking
at
the
as
to
language
here.
and
in
our
view
what
that
means
is
that
a
representation
by
dastar
that
fox
did
sponsor
dastar's
work
or
that
fox
did
not
sponsor
dastar's
work
would
be
covered.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
but
neither
of...
both
of
those
are
in
contrast
to
reverse
passing
off
in
which
the
offending
party
is
putting
its
own
name
on
the
work.
so
that
doesn't
help.
and
the...
the
other
argument...
the
other
construction,
which
is
the
only
competitor
on
the
table
here
by
respondents
to--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
you're
not
stating
that
it
was
originated
by
another
person,
and
that
is
the
statutory
requirement.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
well,
i--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--pardon
me.
i...
i
would
rely
on
the
statutory
distinction.
it's
one
thing
to
make
a
representation
that
the
wrongdoer
is
the
originator,
with
whatever
implications
that
may
have,
and
another
to
make
a
misrepresentation
which...
which
seems
down
the
middle
of
the
alley
of
the
statutory
language,
that
another
person,
fox,
originated
the
work.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
well--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--that,
separate
and
apart
from
the
most
sweeping
argument
we
have,
really
goes
to
a
number
of
other
attacks
on
what
the
lower
court
did.
the
short
answer
is
you
can
if
it
is
not
likely--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--well,
in
the
district
court,
if
one
is
talking
about
the...
the
wheat
and
the
chaff,
on
page
31a
in
which
the
district
court
introduces
its
lengthy
discussion,
the
statement
is
that
the
lawsuit
is
based
on
defendant's
distribution
of
a
video
series,
which
plaintiffs
claim
is
an
infringement
of
the
protected
material
found
in
the
book,
and
is
an
appropriation
of
the
television
series,
crusade
in
europe,
without
proper
credit.
now,
the
reason
i
think
that
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
what
the
district
court
was
doing--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--yes.
i
would
suggest
that
without
proper
credit
means
what
it
says.
it
doesn't
mean
improper
credit.
it
means
that
the
proper
credits
were
not
affixed.
and
then,
of
course,
when
you
look
at
the
ninth
circuit...
circuit--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--i
understand,
justice
ginsburg,
but
again
i
would
urge
that
without
proper
credit,
that
phrase,
is
not
a
statement
that
there
were
improper
credits.
it's
a
statement
that
the
proper
credits
were
absent.
and
i
would
add
that
whatever
ambiguity
may
lurk
in
the
district
court's
findings,
it's
quite
clear
that
at
the
ninth
circuit
level,
which,
of
course,
is
what
this
court
is
reviewing,
the
case
is
a
non-attribution
case.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
correct.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
we
agree
with
that.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
if...
if
i
may
turn
just
for
a
moment
to
some
of
the...
to
the
question
2,
the
remedies
issue.
here
we
would
urge
that
the
statutory
language
and
legislative
intent,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
pertinent,
coalesce.
subject
to
the
principles
of
equity,
means
subject
to
the
principles
of
equity.
this
court,
while
the
lanham
act
was
being
debated,
applied
equitable
principles
in
an
intellectual
property
case
to
define
the
circumstances
under
which
profits
may
be
disgorged.
that's
the
sheldon
case.
and
it
said
equitable
disgorgement
of
profits
is
permissible
only
for
restitutionary
purposes,
only
to
restore
to
plaintiff
something
that
he
has
lost.
that
by
definition
precludes
a
purely
deterrent
award
which
is
not
restitutionary
in
the
slightest.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
i
have
two
short
points.
number
one,
ms.
cendali
contends
that
there
is
no
textual
support
in
the
section
of
the
lanham
act
at
issue,
41(a)(1)(a),
supporting
our
and
the
sg's
interpretation
of
origin
and
excluding
the
authorship
concept.
i
would
suggest
that
she's
wrong.
the
textual
support
is
the
word
origin.
unlike
the
copyright
act,
which
uses
the
word
author,
the
patent
act,
which
uses
the
word
inventor,
the
lanham
act
uses
a
different
word
and
the
word
is
origin.
and
that
is
completely
in
accord
with
this
court's
jurisprudence.
i
think
perhaps
as
justice
souter
had
suggested,
the...
the
purpose
from
a
policy
perspective
is
to
render
efficient
purchasing
decisions,
as
this
court
stated
in
qualitex.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
absolutely.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
yes.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
yes.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
i
think
that
is
forward
passing
off.
i
may
be--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--oh,
excuse
me.
yes.
mr.
david
a.
gerber
the...
the
answer
under
the
specific,
myopic
section
we're
looking
at
that
it
is
correct.
that
would
not
be
assertable.
it
would
be
redressable
under,
arguably,
subsection
(b)
and
we
may
differ
from
the
sg
with
respect
to
commercial
advertising
and
promotion
and
whether
a
point
of
sale
labeling
qualifies.
and
under
a
lot
of
consumer
protection
statutes
in
the
states
as
well
as
the
federal
trade
act,
the...
the
second
point
that
i
promised
responds,
i
believe,
to
justice
o'connor.
i
wanted
to
add
to
the
answer
to
the
question
yes,
this
would
be
a
copyrightable
derivative
work,
the
observation
that
the
copyright
defines
proper
credits
for
derivative
works.
it
tells
owners
of
derivative
works
who
may
be
designated
as
the
copyright
proprietor,
and
the
law
there
is
that
the
owner
of
a
derivative
work,
such
as
dastar,
may
use
its
name.
it
doesn't
have
to
refer
to
the
names
of
owners
of
preexisting
works.
so
what
we
have
with
the
suggestion
of
respondents
is
a
kind
of
dual
series
of
credits,
proper
credits
under
the
copyright
act,
and
then
authorial
credits.
i...
i
would
suggest
another
example
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
it
can
become
quite
burdensome.
you
know,
for
a
very
highly
complex,
iterative
product
like
a
car,
you
might
have
300
pages
of
credits
in
the
owner's
manual
before
you
even
get
to
how
do
you
turn
on
the
key
under
the
alternative
universe
of
credits
that
is
completely
different
from
the
derivative
work
credits
required
by
the
copyright
act.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
then--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--i'm
not
sure
i...
i'm
recalling
the
example
completely.
if
i
get
it,
the
consumer
does
know
who
to
blame.
it
has
the--
mr.
david
a.
gerber
--i'm
not
sure
i
will
buy
into
that
consequence.
where
both
parties
state
their
names
as
manufacturer,
the
consumer
could
be
quite
happy.
he
could
say
dastar's
cost
one-fifth
of
what
fox's
did
and
recommend
it
to
all
of
his
friends.
so
while
there
might
be
confusion
in
the
literal
sense,
it
might
actually
be
salutary.
and
the
efficiency
of
that
type
of
consumer
decision
is
really
what
putting
the
name
of
the
manufacturer
on
enables
the
consumer
to
do.
it
renders
the
transactions
efficient.
