counsel,
would...
would
the
new
dastar
video
qualify
as
a
derivative
work
that
would
deserve
copyright
protection
on
its
own?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
that
issue
being
litigated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
some
kind
of
affirmative
misrepresentation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mm-hmm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to...
to
get
some
kind
of
liability
under
the
lanham
act
under
a
reverse
passing
off
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's...
it's
related
to
this.
this
is
a
so-called
reverse
passing
off
theory
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
relying
on.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
say
there
is
no
such
thing
at
all
or
do
you
acknowledge
that
there
could
be
some
lanham
act
violation
if
there
were
some
kind
of
affirmative
misrepresentation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
indeed,
the
solicitor
general
would
urge
that
we...
we
not
take
the
broader
view.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
well,
we'll
find
out
in
a
minute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
and
is
this
affected
at
all
by
the
fact
that
the
copyright
had
expired?
this
was
in
the
public
domain.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
some...
how
does
that
affect
it?
can
you
put
your
own
name
on
something
that's
now
in
the
public
domain?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
this
was,
in
the
public
domain,
was
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
this
dastar
product
could
have
been
copyrightable
as
a
derivative
work
on
its
own?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
know,
i...
i...
this
just
totally
ignores
the
fact
that
it
was
in
the
public
domain.
i
mean,
of
course,
they
had
a
right
to
copy
it.
why
didn't
fox
renew
the
copyright
if
they
wanted
to
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--does
someone
have
a
right
to
go
in
and
take
part
of
a
previous
work
that's
now
in
the
public
domain
and
add
original
work
to
it
and
reissue
it
under
their
name
and
get
a
derivative
copyright
for
at
least
the
new
part?
now,
is
it
authorized?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
state
court,
we're
talking
about
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
a--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--a
jurisdiction
that
has
taken
a
rather
extreme
view
of
what
the
lanham
act
protects.
that's
what
we're
reviewing.
i
mean,
there...
it...
it's
a
means,
it
seems
to
me,
of
expanding
copyright
protection.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
what
it...
what
the
ninth
circuit
theory
seems
to
me
to
do
is
to
equate
the
likelihood
of
consumer
confusion
with
bodily
appropriation.
now,
in...
in
the
case
of
the
traffic
sign,
once
there
was
no
more
protection
under
law
for
that,
some
other
manufacturer
can
come
in
and
sell
it
and
produce
it
and
that's
a
bodily
appropriation,
all
right,
but
it
wasn't
treated
as
producing
consumer
confusion.
why
should
this?
