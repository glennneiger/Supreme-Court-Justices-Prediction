what
if
the
vote
was
four
to
three?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
against
the
housing
project.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
only
one
had
the
racially
discriminatory
motive,
one
of
the
four.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
three
did
it
on
the
merits.
justice
antonin
scalia
arguably
the
discriminatory
animus
on
the
part
of
the
citizens
could
invalidate
the
referendum.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
even...
even
if
it
wasn't
put
into
effect.
it...
if
there
were
that
animus,
it...
it
could...
by
our
past
cases
anyway,
if
it
could
be
shown,
it
would...
it
would
invalidate
the
referendum.
but
your
point
is
that
whether
the
referendum
was
valid
or
invalid,
the
municipality
would
have
had
to
stay
the
project.
it
wasn't
up
to
the
municipality
to
make
the
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
--we're
trying
to
find
out
what
is
a
sham.
that's...
that's
our
basic
problem.
i
don't
understand
what
is
a
sham.
in
the
antitrust
context--
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
antitrust
context,
i
understand
it
because...
because
there
is
the
law,
and...
and
you
come
up
with
a
phony...
a
phony
law,
you
know,
you
can
say
it's
a
sham.
but
there's
no
law
about
referendums.
you
could
have
a
referendum
on
anything
you
like.
how
can
you
have
a
wrong
referendum--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
thus
a
sham
referendum?
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
talking
about
personal
liability
or
official
liability?
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
so
you're
talking
about
liability--
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
they
do
that
if
they
had
no
choice?
i
mean,
if
the
law
told
them
you
have
to
stop
the
project
once
the
referendum
is
filed,
even
if
in...
in
their
heart
and...
heart
of
hearts
they
were
delighted
for
racial
reasons
that
this
was
the
case,
nonetheless
they
had
no
choice.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
a
legislature
could
do
that,
would...
would
we
enjoin
a
legislature
from
passing
an
unconstitutional
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
federal...
the
federal
congress
passes
unconstitutional
laws
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
we've...
we've
never
been
asked
to
enjoin
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there's
a
difference
between
whether
the
product
is
unconstitutional
and
whether
the
doing
of
it
is
unconstitutional.
and
the
doing
of
an
unconstitutional
referendum,
as
far
as
i
know,
is
not
unconstitutional.
you
are
entitled
to
pass
an
unconstitutional
referendum.
we
will
ignore
it,
however.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
quite
a
proposition.
if...
if
i
have
a...
you
know,
i'm...
i'm
a
racist
and
it
really
makes
me
happy
that
this
act,
which
i'm
compelled
to
do
by
law,
hurts
someone
of
a
certain
race,
that
renders
that
act
invalid
even
though
i'm
compelled
to
do
it
by
law?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
could
win
without
the
referendum.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
referendum's
the
worst
part
of
your
case.
you...
you
wish
there
weren't
a
referendum.
then
they
would
have
had
no
basis
to
deny.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you've
lost
on
that
and
didn't
appeal
it.
i
mean,
he'd
be
a
very
bad
man
for
doing
that,
and
you
might
have
a
cause
of
action
against
him.
but
i
don't
see
any
official
city
action
involved
in
that.
is
it
official
city
action
for
the...
for
the
mayor
to
stimulate
a
referendum?
how
is
that
official
city
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
--people
that
didn't
want
rich
people
to
move
in
the
neighborhood.
justice
antonin
scalia
people
that
didn't
want
rich
people
to
move
into
the
neighborhood.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you're...
you're
now
addressing
the
third
of
the
questions
presented.
it's
the
first
we've
heard
about
the
due
process
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
haven't
abandoned
that
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
still
making
the
due
process
claim.
now,
you
know,
this
is
substantive
due
process
we're
talking
here,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it's
a
fundamental
right
to
have
a
building
permit
granted
within
a...
within
a
reasonable
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
fundamental--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
never
mentioned
procedural
due
process
in
your
brief.
the
first
mention
i
heard
of
it
is
in
your
argument
here,
where
you
say
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
substantive
or
procedural.
your
brief
went
entirely
to
substantive
due
process.
