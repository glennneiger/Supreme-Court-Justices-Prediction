there's
no
evidence
of
some
kind
of
misbehavior
on
the
part
of
the
city
other
than
the
bare
claim
that
they
refused
to
issue
the
permit
during
the
process
of
the
referendum?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i'd
like
to
ask
a
question,
which
is
these
have
been
very
interesting
hypotheticals,
but
are
you
going
to
have
time
to
talk
about
the
questions
that
we
granted
cert
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i'm
interested...
what
we
have
in
front
of
us
now
at
this
point
as
issues.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
here
the
referendum
failed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did...
did
the
city
have
discretion
here
to
go
ahead
and
issue
building
permits
while
the
referendum
process
was
pending?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i...
i
do.
weren't...
weren't
there
some
other
questions
here,
like
didn't
we
grant
cert
on
three
questions--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--have
they
given
up
on
the
second
one?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
last
is
a
due
process?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
substantive
due
process?
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just...
this
is
such
a
strange
argument.
why
wouldn't
we
wait
and
see
if
some
action
was
taken
by
means
of
a
referendum,
passed
and
became
law?
then
wouldn't
we
be
able
to
say
that
constitutes
state
action
at
that
point
and
you
would
subject
it,
conceivably,
to
an
equal
protection
analysis
if
the
issue
is
raised,
and
apply
rational
basis
or
whatever
it
is?
i
don't
understand
why
you
ever
get
to
this
sham
action
and
noerr-pennington.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
are
all
kinds
of
nutty
referendum
measures
that
voters
put
forward.
i...
your
theory
would
seem
to
subject
a
state
or
a
city
or
whatever
it
is
to
a
lawsuit
every
time
there's
one
of
these
nutty
proposals
put
forward.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
in
1995,
the
respondents
purchased
land
zone
for
apartments
in
the
city
of
cuyahoga
falls,
ohio.
they
submitted
the
site
plan
to
the
city
planning
commission
proposing
to
build
multi-family,
low-income
housing
on
the
property.
the
city
council
eventually
approved
the
plan
but
strong
public
opposition
to
the
project
eventually
coalesced
into
a
referendum
petition
drive
calling
for
the
repeal
of
the
city
ordinance
authorizing
the
project.
pursuant
to
the
city
charter,
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
referendum
stayed
the
implementation
of
the
site
plan
until
the
final
vote
on
the
referendum.
while
the
petition
was
the
pending,
the
city
refused
to
issue
respondents
the
building
permits
necessary
to
begin
the
construction.
respondents
brought
suit
in
federal
district
court
alleging
that
the
city
by
submitting
the
petition
to
the
voters
and
refusing
to
issue
the
building
permits
gave
effect
to
the
discriminatory
sentiment
reflected
in
the
public's
opposition
to
the
site
plan.
thus,
violating
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
fourteent
amendment,
as
well
as
the
fair
housing
act.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
city
and
its
officials.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
concluding
that
respondents
had
produced
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
trial
on
each
of
its
claims.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
in
part
and
vacate
and
remand
in
part
that
decision.
respondents
have
not
presented
an
equal
protection
claim
capable
of
surviving
summary
judgment.
neither
of
the
official
acts
respondent
challenge
reflect
the
intent
necessary
to
support
equal
protection
liability.
both
the
decisions
to
submit
the
referendum
petition
to
the
voters
and
the
refusal
to
issue
the
permit
while
the
petition
was
pending
constituted
non-discretionary
ministerial
acts
consistent
with
the
city
charter.
respondents
point
to
no
evidence
suggesting
that
these
acts
were
motivated
by
racial
animus,
nor
did
they
demonstrate
that
the
allegedly
discriminatory
private
motives
that
triggered
the
referendum
drive
can
fairly
be
attributed
to
the
city.
respondents
also
fail
to
present
a
valid
substantive
due
process
claim.
we
need
not
decide
whether
they
possessed
a
property
interest
in
the
building
permits
denied
them
by
the
city,
because
the
city's
refusal
to
issue
the
permits
while
the
petition
was
pending
in
no
sense
constituted
a
egregious
or
arbitrary
government
conduct
in
violation
of
substantive
due
process.
moreover,
our
precedent
forecloses
respondent's
claim
that
the
city's
submission
of
an
administrative
ordinance
to
popular
vote
was
per
se
arbitrary.
the
city's
voters
retained
the
power
to
govern
through
referendum
with
respect
to
any
matter,
legislative
or
administrative
within
the
realm
of
city
affair.
finally,
because
the
respondents
now
have
abandoned
their
fair
housing
act
claim,
we
vacate
that
part
of
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
and
remand
the
constructions
to
dismiss
the
relevant
portion
of
the
complaint
with
prejudice.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
