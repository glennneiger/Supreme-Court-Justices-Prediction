justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
is
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
the
claim
in
your
opinion
that
we
are
reviewing?
i
mean,
i
want
it
to
be
specific.
the
sixth
circuit,
insofar
as
its...
insofar
as
we're
concerned,
we're
interested
in
what
the
lower
courts
held.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what,
in
your
opinion,
is
the
claim
that
they're
reviewing?
is
the
claim
that
these
three
individuals,
the
mayor,
the
clerk,
and
an
engineer,
acting
in
their
official
capacities,
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
other
parts
of
the
constitution
when
they
refused
to
issue
the
permit
despite
the
petition
and
despite
the
provision?
is
that
the
claim?
or
is
the
claim
they
did
something
else
as
well?
they
stirred
up
the
petition
people,
or
they
did
some
other
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
only
the
first.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
it
was.
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
your
brief
from
this
point
of
view.
you
were
talking
about
an
antitrust
analogy.
i
mean,
imagine
a
plaintiff
in
an
antitrust
case
deliberately,
to
ruin
his
competitor...
and
no
one
doubts
it...
files
a
case
in
the
court.
now,
no
matter
how
evil
that
person
was,
i
can't
imagine
or
i
haven't
heard
to
date
under
the
antitrust
law
or
any
other
law
somebody
who
would
sue
the
clerk
of
the
court
because
he
docketed
the...
he
docketed
the...
the
claim...
he
docketed
the
complaint.
and
according
to
what
you've
said,
that's
what's
at
issue
here,
that
they're...
they're
simply
carry...
now,
i...
i
need
some
explanation.
i'm
bringing
it
up
because
i'm
quite
honestly
confused
about
that
part--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i...
i
bring
it
up
because
i'm
confused
as
to
how
in
your
mind
you
see
this
thing
working.
i...
i
mean,
i
suppose
if
a
city
has
a
totally
evil,
horrible
petition
for
a...
for
a...
for
a
referendum,
a
person
still
could
make
it
and
the
person
who's
in
charge
of
carrying
out
the...
the
non...
the
ministerial
duties
himself
would
not
be
sued
even
if
that
person
himself
was
evil.
so...
so
what
is
the...
what...
what...
how
does
this
all
work
in
your
mind?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
assume
it's
a
sham.
it...
they're
evil.
they're
horrible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
terrible.
i
would
think
even
an
evil,
horrible,
terrible
person
has
the
right
to
go
to
the
legislature
and
petition
and
that
the
clerks
who
are
to
file
that
petition
are
themselves
clerks,
and
they're
to
do
it
even
if
they're
evil
themselves.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
i'm
worried,
in
about
2
minutes
from
now
i'm
going
to
hear
the
other
side
get
up,
and
they're
going
to
say
this
is
a
sham.
okay?
i
suspect.
now,
that's
why
i
want
to
understand
the
relevance
of
this.
and
i...
i
come
into
this
thinking
if
it's
the
nazis,
the...
the
most
terrible
racists
that
steal,
the
most
terrible
people
in
the
world,
if
they're
americans,
they
can
come
in
and
they
can
vote
and
they
can
go
to
their
legislature
and
they
can
put
anything
they
want
on
the
ballot.
and
the...
the
people
who
are
mechanically
in
charge
of
seeing
that
those
things
are
voted
on,
that's
their
job,
they
should
do
it,
and
if
those
are
evil
and
terrible
and
contrary
to
the
constitution,
the
courts
will
strike
them
down
when
they
get
passed.
now,
what's...
now,
you
explain
how
your
thing
fits
into
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
clerk
in
that
case...
the
clerk
of
the
court
who
says
i'm
putting
this
on
the
ballot...
he's
violated
the
law
in
putting
it
on
the
ballot?
of
course,
if
it's
passed,
it's
totally
unconstitutional.
but
you're
saying
that
the
clerks
shouldn't
even
put
that
on
the
ballot?
i
mean,
that
would
be
quite
a
novel
proposition
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
it
be--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
but
wait.
the...
the
project
is
built.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
you've
got
your
project.
and
now
what
you're
saying
is
that
they
violated
the
constitution
in
not
giving
you
the
permit
quicker.
and
they...
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
they
come
back
and
they
say,
how
could
we
give
it
to
you
quicker?
there
were
petitioners
who
they...
a
petition
and
the
law
prevents
us
from
giving
it
to
you
quicker
because
once
a
petition's
on
the
ballot,
the
law
says
we
can't
give
it
to
you.
now,
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
but
explain
to
me
a
little
bit
better
what...
their
response
is
the
reason
we
didn't
give
you
the
permit
faster
is
because
here's
the
provision
of
the
law.
it
says
once
a
petition
for
referendum
is
filed,
and
it
says
whether
it's
legal
or
illegal,
we
have
to
delay
this.
now,
your
response
to
that
is...
they
say,
what
should
we
have
done
that
we
didn't
do
once
that
petition
was
filed.
and
your
response
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
i'm
hearing
you
saying...
what
i'm
hearing
you
saying
in
response
to
my
question
is,
i'm
the
mayor
and
the
other,
and
i
say,
what
do
you
want
me
to
do?
the
statute
said,
don't
give
you
the
permit
because
the
petition
has
been
filed.
what
could
i
have
done?
and
your
answer
to
that
basically
seems
to
be,
nothing.
you
couldn't
have
done
anything.
we
agree.
but
the
petition
itself
was
an
evil
petition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
evil
being
quotes
for
what
we
all
know
is
going
on.
all
right?
so
it's
an
evil
petition.
and
therefore,
when
you
face
this
evil
petition,
even
though
you
couldn't
do
anything
about
it,
you
have
to
pay
damages
because
the
reason
we
were
delayed
was
because
of
that
process.
now,
is
that
basically
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now,
the
reason
that
that
bothers
me,
of
course,
is
because
i
can
think
of
a
whole
range
of
evil
legislative
acts,
and
i
can
think
of
quasi-acts
that
i'm
not
sure
about,
and
then
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
ones
i
like.
all
right.
so...
so...
but
i'm
worried.
in
the
first
category
and
the
second
category,
once
we
got
into
the
business
of
paying
damages,
because
it
turns
out
that
they
are
evil,
that
would,
in
fact,
chill
the
legislative
process,
which
is
a
democratic
process.
and
i
think
that's
the
argument
they're
trying
to
make.
so
i'd
like
to
get
your
response
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
just
want
to
finish...
but
i
just
wanted,
before
you
finish,
if
you'd
respond
to
something
justice
stevens
said,
which
is
about
regulatory
takings.
i
mean,
what
is
in
the
back
of
my
mind
here,
to
stimulate
an
answer,
is
suppose
you
weren't
section
8
housing.
suppose
you
were
building
a
hotel.
and
suppose
the
referendum
wasn't
people
who
might
be
bigoted...
may,
perhaps...
i
don't...
but
suppose
they
were
environmentalists,
and...
and
suppose
the
constitutional
claim
was
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
good.
the...
the...
you
see.
and
suppose
the
constitutional
claim
were
a
takings
claim.
now,
if
i
uphold
for
you
here,
if
the
court
votes
for
you
here,
wouldn't
it
then
have
to
say
that
all
these
environmental
cases
and
so
forth...
i...
i
don't
want
to
win
your
case
for
you,
but
i
might
be
in
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
the...
you
see...
see
there'd
be
quite
a
problem
about
whether
a
city
wouldn't
have
to
pay
damages
every
time
that
they
make
a
mistake
in
their
environmental
regulation
and
perhaps
try
to
stop
a
hotel
and
they
thought
they
could
stop
it,
but
it
turns
out
later
they
couldn't.
you
see...
do
you
see
the
analogy
that's
worrying
me?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
do
you...
what
do
you...
what
do
you
say
about
that?
