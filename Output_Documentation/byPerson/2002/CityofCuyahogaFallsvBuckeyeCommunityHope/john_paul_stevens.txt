justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
there
some
evidence
that
some
city
official
was...
sought
to
delay
the
proceedings
for
a
period
of
time,
not...
not
officially.
it
didn't
take...
pass
any
resolution,
but
didn't
they
oppose
immediate
action
on
a
couple
of
occasions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
one
of
those
comments
said
we
should
fight
this
because
we
don't
want
african-americans
to...
to
move
where
they're
going
to
move,
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
even...
if
that
had
happened,
it
would
still
be
true,
as
you
pointed
out
earlier,
that
every
official
action
taken
by
the
city
was
favorable
to
the...
your
opponents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what...
i'm
trying
to
be
sure
i
understand.
i...
i
think
i
understand
your
position.
is...
your
position
is
that
even
if
this
ambiguous
evidence
was...
clearly
showed
racial
hostility
and
that's
why
we're
trying
to
delay
it,
there
still
would
be
no
cause
of
action
because
everything
the
city
did
was
in
favor
of...
officially
was
in
favor
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
that
really,
we
don't
have
to
try
and
draw...
to
decide
whether
or
not
inferences
of
improper
motive
can
be
drawn
from
those
statements.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nager,
i
think...
i
understand
your
argument
as
it
applies
to
the
city,
but
am
i
correct
that
the
mayor
is
an
individual
defendant
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
wasn't
that
reversed
by
the
sixth
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
he
a
petitioner
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
so
there's
no
individual
liability
at
stake
here
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
nager,
is
the
complaint
in
the
record?
i
couldn't
find
it.
in
the...
in
the
papers
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't...
wouldn't
it
be
a
sham...
let
me
just
put
this
on
the
table.
as
i
understand
it,
the
ohio
supreme
court
said
that
this
was
not
a
legal
referendum
when
it
got
all
through
with
things.
and
if
everybody
had
known
before
the...
the
case
started
that
it
was
an
illegal
referendum,
that
would
have
been
a
sham,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
your
view
on
the
hypothetical
i
asked
to
the
other
lawyer?
supposing
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
mayor
and
everybody
else
in
this
used
the
referendum
as
a
method
of
delaying
a
granting
of
the
permit
and
that
they
did
so
for
racially
motivated
reasons,
would
there
be
any...
any
liability
on
anybody?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
was,
but
they...
they
figured
it
was
going
to
lose
in
the
long
run,
but
nevertheless,
let's
assume
they
wanted
to
delay
things
for
60,
90
days,
whatever
it
might
be,
because
they
wanted
to
delay
it
on...
on,
you
know,
this...
this
project.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it...
if
it
were
clear
because
this
case
is
on
summary
judgment,
so
really
don't
know
what
the
facts
are--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
if
there
were
clear
evidence
that
the
mayor
and
everybody
else
act
up
in
a
racially
motivated
reason,
would
there
be
liability
in
that
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
everybody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
assuming
everybody
who
opposed
the
project
was
racially
motivated
and
that
could
be
demonstrated
with
tape
recorder.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so...
so
your
answer
would
be
no
liability
in
that
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kramer,
i
asked
your
opponent,
but
is
the...
is
the
complaint
in
the
papers
before
us,
do...
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
i
was
curious
about,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
did
you
include
a
regulatory
takings
claim
in
your
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
also
there
were
eight
other
members
of
the
court
that
disagreed
with
me
if
i
remember
correctly--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
there
was...
if
it
was
racially
motivated,
there
was
just
sort
of
an
arbitrary.
there
was
an
absence
of
a
legitimate
reason
for
the
delays
and
the
shenanigans
and
so
forth.
but
it
seemed
to
me
the
same
argument
could...
could
be
made
if
they
were
trying
to
protect
the
wetlands,
and
they
used
the
same
kind
of
shenanigans.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
would
be
no
racial
basis.
