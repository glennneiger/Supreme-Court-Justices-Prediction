mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
a
municipality
may
be
held
liable
in
damages
because
it
withheld
the
issuance
of
building
permits
for
a
proposed
housing
project
pending
a
citizen-initiated
referendum
election
on
the
ordinance
authorizing
that
housing
project.
in
so
doing,
the
sixth
circuit
failed
to
appreciate
that
the
municipality's
actions
here
were
all
taken
pursuant
to
pre-existing
procedures
set
forth
in
the
city's
charter,
procedures
that
the
city
followed
to
the
letter.
as
non-discretionary
acts
taken
in
the
normal
prescribed
course,
the
municipality's
actions
here
were
necessarily
rational
ones
taken
without
discriminatory
motives
and
without
treating
the
respondents
here
any
differently
than
any
other
beneficiary
of
an
ordinance
would
have
been
treated
that
was
subject
to
a
petition.
and
for
that
reason,
we
respectfully
suggest
that
the
sixth
circuit--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
every
official
action
of
the
city
here
favored
the
respondents.
the
city
planning
commission
recommended
approval
of
the
housing
project
and
of
the
site
plan
authorizing
the
housing
project.
the
city
council
voted
in
favor
of
the
housing
project.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
justice
stevens,
prior
to
the
city
council
voting
on
the...
the
ordinance
to
approve
the
project,
there
was
a
lot
of
public
debate,
and
in
that
public
debate,
there
were
city
officials
who
said
we...
we
need
to
take
time
to
hear
the
citizens...
citizens'
concerns.
we
need
to
take
time
to
understand
what
we're
doing,
and
there
were
even
comments,
we
should
fight
this.
we
should
fight
this
and
delay
this.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it...
it
could
make
a
difference.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
if...
if
the
actions
were
taken
favorably
to
the
opponents,
it
couldn't
make
a
difference
because
at
that
point
the
alleged
statement
wouldn't
have
any
connection
to
an
adverse
action.
that...
that's
the
important
point
in
this
case
because
in
order
to
have
discrimination,
either
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
or
in
violation
of
the
fair
housing
act,
you
not
only
have
to
have
a
motive,
you
have
to
have
adverse
differential
treatment
by
the
person--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that...
that's
correct.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
correct
because
in
this
case,
all
of
the
city's
actions
either
favored
the
project
or
non-discretionary
actions.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
short
answer
to
that
question
is
the
answer
would
be
the
same.
of
course,
if
the
referendum
were
enacted,
it
went
to
a
vote
and
it
were
put
into
effect
and
it
was
racially
motivated,
that
action
would
be
subject
to
challenge
because
that
would
be,
in
fact,
an
action
of
the
city
because
they
would
have
adopted,
under
your
hypothetical
facts,
an
ordinance
that
could
allegedly
have
a
discriminatory
intent.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
and
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
and
the
answer
to
that
is
no
because
the
delay
that
happened
here
is
the
delay
that
would
happen
with
regard
to
any
referendum
that
was
subject
to
a
referendum
petition.
and
the
record
here
is
quite
clear--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
it's
a
different
case,
but
it's
not
different
outcome
here,
and
the--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
because
under
monell
and
its
progeny,
as
well
as
this
court's
state
action
cases,
the
municipality
can
be
held
liable
only
in
damages
only
if
the
city...
an
official
with
the
authority
to
authorize
it
has
authorized
the
discriminatory
action
that
you're
talking
about.
in
this
specific
instance,
the...
every
official
action
favored
the
project,
and
the
delay
that
you're
talking
about
was
authorized
by
a
city
charter
created
30
years
before
the
fact.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no,
because
they
wouldn't
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
there's
a
difference
between
six
city
council
members
voting
at
a
city
council
meeting
as
to
what
the
actions
of
the
city
are,
and
six
city
council
members
going
out
on
their
own
in
their
private
capacities
and
expressing
their
views
as
citizens,
and...
and
trying
to
get
other
citizens
to
agree
with
them
as
to
their
private
views.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
it
shouldn't.
under
arlington
heights
and
this
court's
cases,
the
city
could
be
held
liable
only
if
those
authorized,
in
this
instance
a
majority
of
the
city
council,
had
the...
the
discriminatory--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--four...
if
it
was
four
to
three
in
favor
of
the
housing
project--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--if...
if
they
had
discretionary
power,
and
four
of
them
exercised
their
discretionary
power
against
the
housing
project
on
the
basis
of
racially
discriminatory--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i
think
there,
there
would
be
a
good
argument
that
they
would
still...
that...
that
the
plaintiffs
would
have...
would
have
satisfied
their
burden
of
showing
but
for
the
racially
discriminatory
motive,
that
the
housing
project
would
have
been
approved.
so
in...
in
that
hypothetical,
which
is
not
the
facts
of
this
case,
of
course,
they...
they
would
have
had
sufficient
evidence
to
state
a
claim.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
obviously
our
hardest
hypothetical,
but
it's
also
the
same
answer.
and
it...
and
one
of
the
reasons
it's
the
same
answer
is
because,
remember,
under
your
hypothetical,
the
notion
is
that
if
these
city
officials,
not
acting
in
their...
exercising
their
official
powers,
but
acting
in
the
role
any
citizen
can,
can
go
out
and
organize
the
citizens
of
the
community
acting
in
their
private
capacities
to
get
a
referendum
on
the
ballot
and
vote
against
it.
of
course,
that's
what
democracy
is
about.
it's
about
politicians
taking
on
causes
on
behalf
of
people--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--he
was.
he
was
granted
summary
judgment
by
the
district
court
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
in
his
individual
capacity
had
committed
any
of
the
acts
that
were
alleged
against
him,
and
that
he
had
not
organized
the
campaign--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--no,
it
wasn't.
that
issue
was
not
taken
up
to
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
he's
only
here
in
his
official
capacity.
he
was
sued
in
both
his
individual
capacity
and
in
his
official
capacity.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no,
not...
not--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--the
issue
that
you
have
before
us
is
the
sixth
circuit's
judgment
is...
is...
because
under
the
sixth
circuit's
view
there
was
allegedly
evidence
of
racial
bias
among
the
citizens
that
the
municipality
could
be...
somehow
be
held
liable
for
that.
and
that's
wrong
for
two
reasons.
one,
it's
wrong
because
the
municipality
itself
has
to
have
the
discriminatory
animus,
and
there's
no...
not
only
no
evidence
of
that
here,
it
couldn't
have
been
the
case
since
they...
of
course,
all
of
their
actions
were
voting
in
favor
of
it,
or
treating
the
action
neutrally.
secondly--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--if
it
was
voted
on
and
put
into
effect,
the
alleged
animus--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that...
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
i...
i
do
want
to
make
clear
that
under
this
court's
cases,
the
court
has
never
said
that...
that
the
first
amendment
activity
of
a
petition
itself
is
subject
to
an
equal
protection
challenge.
what
the
court's
cases
say
is
if
there
is
a
vote,
either
on
a
bill
by
elected
representatives,
or
on
a
petition
by
citizens,
that
the
end
product
of
that,
which
becomes
a
law,
can
be
challenged,
and
that
private
animus
in
that...
is
contextual
evidence
for
whether
or
not
the
people
who
voted
on
that
final
product
were
themselves
motivated
by
discriminatory
animus.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
the...
the
question
is
if
there's
a
final
product,
was
the...
the
final
law,
was
that
racially
motivated--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--no,
you
haven't,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
the
court
has
said
is,
is
that
intent
of
the
law
is
the
key
test,
and
what
the
court
has
said
in
arlington
heights
is
because
you
can't
look
directly
at
the
motives
of
the
people
who
voted
on
it,
whether
they
be
legislators
protected
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause
or
citizens
protected
by
the...
the
secrecy
of
the
ballot
in
this
country,
they
look
at
other
indicia
to
determine
their
intent.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
correct.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
correct.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that...
well,
the...
we
don't
know
the
outcome
because
the
respondents
asked
for
the
final
vote
not
to
be
certified.
but
what
is
important
here,
i
think,
to
address
the
issue
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
the...
the
position
of
the
sixth
circuit
here
is
that
the
municipality
is
somehow
supposed
to
inquire
behind
a
facially
neutral
referendum
petition
and
determine
the
intent
and
motives
of
people
engaged
in
the
first
amendment.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no,
it
didn't.
once
the
referendum
petition
was
filed,
under
the
city
charter,
the...
at
that
point,
all
the
city
council
could
do
is
repeal
its
own
ordinance
or
submit
the
ordinance
to
a
vote
of
the
voters.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
correct.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
the...
the
sixth
circuit
said
it
was
the
former.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
correct.
respondents
in
their
brief
have
abandoned
what
the
sixth
circuit
held
and
which
we
petitioned
and
the
court
granted
cert
to
review
to
argue
a
completely
different
theory.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
don't
believe
that
it
is.
no,
i
don't
believe...
i
mean,
it's...
it's
obviously
in
the
record
of
the
case.
it
wasn't
reprinted
in
the...
in
the
joint
appendix.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
you
did--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
they've
abandoned
their
claim
that
they
litigated
and
prevailed
on
in
the
sixth
circuit,
that
they
could
proceed
on
the
disparate
impact
theory.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
a...
a
substantive
due
process
claim.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
and
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
there
was
a
triable
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
the
city
had
acted
rationally
in
proceeding
forward
with
its
referendum
petition.
and
we
would
say
that
the
simple
answer
to
that
was
at
that
time,
the
city
charter
required
the
city
officials
to
do
so
and
that
judgment
was
adopted
by
three
courts
until
the
ohio
supreme
court
several
years
later
reversed
itself
on
what
the
meaning
of
the
ohio
constitution
was.
but
the
subsequent
reversal
of
this
highest
court's
evaluation
of
what
the
law
was
can't
change
the
rationality
of
the
acts
at
the
time
that
they
were
taken.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
respect
to
the
disparate
impact
claim,
i
would
just
like
to
clarify
that
we
were
the
petitioners,
and
the
court
did
grant
certiorari
on
the
issue
and
there
is
a
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit
against
my
clients
on
that
issue.
and
while
they've
abandoned
the
claim
and
declined
to
defend
the
sixth
circuit's
judgment,
we
would
request
the
court
vacate
that
judgment
and
instruct
that
the
disparate
impact
claim
be
dismissed
with
prejudice.
with...
justice
breyer,
with
respect
to
your
questions
to
my
opposing
counsel,
a
point
we'd
like
to
add
to
what
you
had
to
say
is
simply
that
if
we
had
done
what
they
wanted,
we
would
have
been
subjected
to
a
damages
claim.
it
would
have
been
a
first
amendment
claim
by
the
citizens
seeking
to
put
something
on
the
ballot
by
initiating
a
petition,
and
it...
it
can't
be
that
in
order
to
avoid
a
fourteenth
amendment
damages
claim,
we
have
to
violate
other
people's
first
amendment
rights.
if
the
court
doesn't
have
any
further
questions,
we
have
nothing
further.
