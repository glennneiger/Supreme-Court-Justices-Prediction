mr.
edward
kramer
it's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
we...
we
have
waived
that
claim
that
had
been
certified
by...
by
this
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
city
and
the
solicitor
general
has
tried
to
complicate
what
really
is
a
very
simple
case.
what
is
the
injury
that
the
plaintiff
is
complaining
about?
the
plaintiffs
have
been
denied
unlawfully
their
site
plan
and
its
benefits,
including
a
building
permit.
city
conduct.
nothing
to
do
with
referendums.
nothing
to
do
with
first
amendment
rights.
the
issues
of
liability
in
this
case,
which
the
sixth
circuit
took
up,
was
did
the
city
and
its
officers
act
out
of
discriminatory
motive
by
delaying
this
housing
project
and
refusing
to
give
effect
to
the
site
plan
ordinance
to
appease
racial
and
anti-family
prejudices
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause--
mr.
edward
kramer
--we
believe
that
they
did
have
a
choice
and
we
cite
cases
to
the
court
from
the
ohio
supreme
court
on
page
25
of
our
brief
that
indicates
that
the
petitions
did
not
have
to
be
certified
by
the...
the
court...
by
the
city.
mr.
edward
kramer
the
lower
courts
weren't
asked
that
question,
your
honor,
because
we're
really
talking
about
whether
or
not
they...
there
was
an
official
conduct
by
the
city.
mr.
edward
kramer
as
i
said,
i
don't
really
believe
the
sixth
circuit
approached
the...
the
case
from...
from
that
particular
issue.
mr.
edward
kramer
there
was
discretion,
we
believe,
and
we
certainly
provided
evidence.
and
again,
as...
as
was
indicated
by
the
court
to
the
solicitor
general,
this
is
on
summary
judgment.
for
example,
in
the
record,
there
is
an
affidavit
from
the
law
director
for
the
village
of
orange
that
we
filed
with
our
brief
in
opposing
summary
judgment
that
indicated
that
there
was
discretion
not
to
certify
the
referendum.
mr.
edward
kramer
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
kramer
as
one
element
of
proof,
we
indicated
that
that
showed
that
there
was
discretion.
but
the
ohio
case
law
indicates
there
are
instances
where,
if
the
subject
was
inappropriate...
and
let's
remember
the
ohio
supreme
court
ruled
that
this
was
not
an
appropriate
subject
for
a
referendum.
mr.
edward
kramer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
kramer
that's
correct,
and
it
also
only
had--
mr.
edward
kramer
--well,
the...
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
edward
kramer
i
don't
know
of
ohio
law,
but
certainly
this
court's
decision
in
hunter
versus
erickson
dealing
with
an
ohio
referendum
indicates
that
that
type
of
referendum
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
edward
kramer
well,
with...
mr.
chief
justice,
we
are
talking
about
the...
this
court's
jurisprudence
that
deals
with
the...
simply
because
it's
a
referendum,
if
the
legislature
could
not
do
this,
pass
a
law
that
says,
for
example,
that
african-americans
cannot
own
property,
like
in
buchanan
versus
warley--
mr.
edward
kramer
--and...
no.
mr.
edward
kramer
and...
you're
correct,
justice
scalia.
and
we
have
not
asked
for
that.
mr.
edward
kramer
and
it
may
subject,
if
there
is
direct
injury,
damages
to
my
client,
and
that
is
all
we
have
before
this
case.
mr.
edward
kramer
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
kramer
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
kramer
the
response
is
that
it
was
the
city's
actions...
we
believe
the
evidence
that
we've
proffered
to...
in
the
summary
judgment
shows
that
they
took
this
action
as
a
public-private
partnership.
the
mayor,
city
councilpeople
looked
for...
as
they...
one
city
councilman
said,
any
legal
shred
to
be
able
to
reject
this
development.
mr.
edward
kramer
what
should
be
done
in
a
case
like
this
is
that
there
is
an
injury
to
my
client.
the
injury,
whether
it
was
discretionary
or
non-discretionary,
is...
is
not
the...
the
question.
what
was
the
purpose
behind
denying
the
building
permit?
and
under
arlington
heights,
this
court
has
indicated
one
of
the
things
that
a
court
can
look
at
as
competent
evidence
is
did
the
city
officials
take
action
to
appease
racial
bias.
even
if
it
was
a
nondiscretionary
act,
if
the
effect
of
that
was
to
permit
private
bias,
they've
committed
a
violation.
mr.
edward
kramer
what
we're
saying
is
that
it
may
not
be
invalid,
but
it
may
cause
liability.
it
can
be
a
legal
act--
mr.
edward
kramer
--yes,
justice
breyer.
we're...
we're
saying
that
even
if
it
was
a
legal
thing
to
do,
if
the
act
of
it
was
because
of
racial
or
anti-family
bias,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the--
mr.
edward
kramer
--what
i
would
say,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the
fact
that
there
was
an
evil
motive
behind
any
of
these
acts...
and
by
the
way,
the
referendum
is
only
the
culmination
of
the
acts.
there
was
a
series
of
discretionary
acts.
for
example,
the
strategy
of
the
city
was
to
do
two
things.
one
was
to
delay
this
project
because
they
knew
that
there
was
a...
a
very
finite
period
of
time
for
our
little
non-profit
tax-exempt
developer
to
build
this
project
or
lose
their
financing.
so
they
knew
the
longer
they
could
delay,
the
more
likely
the
project
would
die.
and
second
of
all,
they
wanted
to
make
the
project
more
costly.
so,
for
example,
they
required,
before
we
even
talked
about
a
referendum,
a
barrier
wall
to
be
built
before
even
a
building
permit
that
could
be
issued,
a
6-foot
earthen
wall
with
a
5-foot
fence
between
two
conforming
multi-family
projects.
mr.
edward
kramer
my
client
was
willing
to
do
that
because
he
was
told
by
the
city
it
would
smooth
the
process
over.
he
certainly
did
not
waive
his
rights.
and
in
the
depositions,
the
planning
commissioner,
louis
sharpe,
specifically
testified
the
reason
he
was
demanding
that
was
because
our
project
was
going
to
have
a
large
number
of
children.
now,
under
the
federal
fair
housing
act,
as
amended
in
1988,
such
an
act
may
well
violate
the
protection
against...
against
children.
mr.
edward
kramer
no,
but
there
was
three
hearings
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
public
opposition.
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
the--
mr.
edward
kramer
--the
actual
complaint
that
we
are...
where
we
think
we
were
injured
was
the
building
permits
not
being
provided
to
us.
the
delay
goes
to
the
amount
of
damages
we
think
our
client
has
suffered.
the
official
act
that
we're
talking
about
is
the
building
permits
being...
not
being
issued.
and--
mr.
edward
kramer
--that's
correct,
and
we
submitted
our
building
permits
after
the...
the
approval
by
the...
the
city
council.
what
we're
talking
about,
your
honor,
is
that
the
city's
actions
in
denying
that
building
permit...
we're...
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
all
we're
talking
about
is
summary
judgment.
is
there
sufficient
evidence
that
a
trier
of
fact
would
find
that
the...
the
actual
denial
was
racial
prejudice
of
city
officials
or
appeasement
by
city
officials--
mr.
edward
kramer
--your
honor,
the
complaint
is
not
in
the
appendix,
but
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
that
was
filed
with
the
sixth
circuit.
you'll
find
that
in
volume
i
on
page
37
of
the
record.
but
it's...
it's
the
sixth
circuit
joint
appendix--
mr.
edward
kramer
--which
i
believe
this
court
does
have.
mr.
edward
kramer
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
edward
kramer
it's
the
latter,
justice
souter.
we're
saying
that
the
referendum,
which
was
part
of
an
overall
scheme
by
city
officials
to
delay
this
project
so
that
it
would
kill
it.
and
so
the
injury
that
we're
talking
about
from...
from
the
referendum
deals
with
the
city
officials
using
that
as
the
legal
shred
to
be
able
to
deny
the
building
permits.
and
the
evidence
we
believe
that
we
have
proffered
to
the
court
through
the
summary
judgment
motion
is
that
there
was
not
only
citizen
bias,
which
under
arlington
heights,
this
court
has
indicated
we
certainly
can
allow...
it's
competent
evidence
that
can
be
looked
at
of
whether
or
not
legislators
used
that
bias
to
be
able
to
take
that
action.
mr.
edward
kramer
absolutely,
justice
souter,
because
the...
what
we
are
complaining
about
is
the
denial
of
the
building
permit.
that's
the
injury
that--
mr.
edward
kramer
--that's
correct.
mr.
edward
kramer
to
deny
in...
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
kramer
i
would
say
that
we
had
some
claim
for
the
time
between
when
we
submitted
the
request
for
the
building
permits
and
how
long
it
took
them
to
be
able
to--
mr.
edward
kramer
--that
would
have
been
a
matter...
well,
we
don't
know.
let
me
say--
mr.
edward
kramer
--we
don't
know
because
in
the
record
mayor
robart
sent
a
letter
ordering
his
building
commissioner
not
to
issue
a
building
permits,
and
that
was--
mr.
edward
kramer
--even
prior
to
the
referendum--
mr.
edward
kramer
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
we...
we
believe
we
indicated
that
this
was
not
something
that
the
city
responded
from...
responded
to
from
their
citizens,
but
this
was
a
scheme
where
city
officials,
including
mayor
robart
with
other
private
citizens,
got
together
and
said,
how
can
we
deny
this
project.
mr.
edward
kramer
and
we're
not
talking
about
that
that's
something
that
caused
a
damage.
what
we're
talking
about
is,
is
there
evidence
that
we
can
use
to
show
that
the
ultimate
decision,
which
was
to
deny
the
building
permit
that
caused
the
injury...
is
there
evidence
that
the
mayor
participated
in...
to
appease
racial
and
anti-family
bias.
this
is
really
a
simple
arlington
heights
case.
the--
mr.
edward
kramer
--the
problem--
mr.
edward
kramer
--i
understand
the
analogy.
mr.
edward
kramer
the
difference,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the...
we
are
asking
only
for
the
court
to
look
at
the
issue
of
has
the
plaintiffs
proffered
sufficient
evidence
that
racial
bias
and
anti-family
bias
was
involved
in
the
decision
to
deny
the
building
permit.
the
referendum
was
part
of
the...
an
overall
scheme
by
city
officials
to
delay
and
ultimately
kill
this
project.
if
that
is
the
case,
then
the
referendum,
which
ohio
supreme
court
has
ruled
was
illegal
to
begin
with...
even
if
it
was
legal,
we
believe
under
your
jurisprudence
if
the
motivation
of
the
city
to
use
the
referendum
was
unlawful,
the
violation
occurs
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
equal
protection
clause.
with
regards
to
your
question
about
the
regulatory
taking,
we
saw
this...
this
case
under
a
due
process...
substantive
due
process,
procedural
due
process...
examination
very
similar,
i
think,
to
the
situation
that's
actually
the
exact
opposite
to
the
city
of
eastlake
versus
forest
city
case,
which
justice
stevens
is
the
only
participating
member
that
was
on
that
particular
case.
mr.
edward
kramer
but
we
have
a
new
court,
your
honor.
[laughter]
and...
and
we
believe--
mr.
edward
kramer
--that's
correct.
mr.
edward
kramer
absolutely
not.
mr.
edward
kramer
well,
substantive,
or--
mr.
edward
kramer
--we're
not
talking--
mr.
edward
kramer
--about
a
reasonable
period.
we're
talking
about
both...
we
had
raised
both
procedural
and
substantive
due
process
claims
in
the
lower
courts.
what
we're
saying
is
the
process
was
so
fundamentally
flawed
that
it
rises
to
a...
a
due
process
violation.
whether
it's
substantive
or
procedural,
we
don't
believe
is...
is
really
the
issue
here.
we're
talking
about
a
process
where
there
was
a
whole
set
of
procedures
set
up
by
the
city
of
cuyahoga
falls
of
how
to
approve
this
site
plan
ordinance.
the...
the
site
plan
procedures
were
set
forth,
permitted
for
a
record
to
be
developed,
and
there
was
a...
planning
commission
meetings.
there
was
the
city
council
meetings.
and
if
the
city
council
or
the
planning
commission
had
denied
our
right
to
the
site
plan
ordinance
and
its
benefits,
we
would
have
had
a
right
under
ohio
law
to
go
under
the
ohio
administrative
procedure
act
and
get
a
court
to
review
that
issue.
mr.
edward
kramer
well,
the
only
reason
why
the
people
are
able
to
get
a
referendum
is
because
the
city
charter,
which
is
their
constitution,
permitted
that.
mr.
edward
kramer
that's
right,
but
in
the...
the
due
process
area,
your
honor,
we're
not
talking
about
discriminatory
intent.
all
we're
talking
about
is
looking
at
whether
the
procedure
set
forth
is
fundamentally
flawed
and
does
it...
is
it
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
not
substantially
related
to
the
general
welfare
as...
as
this
court
has
talked
about
ever
since--
mr.
edward
kramer
--no.
we're
talking
about
whether
you
have
to
have
a...
a
protected
property
interest
and
you
also
have
to
have
a
situation
where
there
is
a
arbitrary
and
capricious
action.
in
this
case,
we
have
ownership
of
property,
which
under
the
original
intention
of...
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution,
ownership
of
private
property
and
the
ability
to
develop
using
this
property
for
a
lawful
purpose
is
protected
by
the
due
process
clause.
and
when
you
look
at
the
issue--
mr.
edward
kramer
--well,
your
honor,
we
certainly
raised
the
question
about
if
this
was
a
discriminatory
motive,
that
would
mean
that
there
would
not
be...
under
general
welfare.
mr.
edward
kramer
but
more
importantly,
our
argument
is
that
there
is
a
per
se
violation
whenever
you
have
an
administrative
matter
which
should
be
taken
up
through
the
city
council
or
through
the
courts
or
through
a...
from...
from
an
administrative
agency
like
the
planning
commission.
and
the
evidence
in
the
record,
as
the
lower
courts
point
out,
is
that
we
met
all
the
requirements
for
the
city
to...
to
get
our
site
plan.
and
then,
when
the
city
council
approved
it,
when
the
planning
director
said
we
met
or
exceeded
the
site
plan
ordinance,
they
put
it
to
a
referendum
and
they
asked
20,000
voters
to
approve
or
disapprove
a
site
plan
ordinance,
they
never
saw
and
the...
and
whether
or
not
that
site
plan
ordinance
conformed
to
the
building
and
zoning
code
that
they
never
read.
if
that
is
not--
mr.
edward
kramer
--i
would
say
we...
we
are
asking
for
a
fairly
narrow
interpretation.
we're
saying
if
it's
an
administrative
matter
which
should
not
be
subject
to
the
decision
of
voters
because
this
is
not
legislative--
mr.
edward
kramer
--justice
souter,
we...
that
is
something
that
we
have
raised
in
our
brief,
but
we
have...
also
have
raised
a
much
narrower
issue
which
would
be
simply
looking
at
a
site
plan
ordinance,
should
it
be
subjected
to
a
popularity
contest?
there...
it's
standard-less.
this
court
has
ruled
in--
mr.
edward
kramer
--well,
the
reason
that
we
didn't
raise
that
is
the
court
didn't
certify
a
question
other
than
to
substantive
due
process.
we
believe
that
it
really
subsumes
that
issue
when
you
look
at...
the
procedure
itself
is
so
fundamentally
flawed.
it
is
very
similar
to
the...
the
situation
in
the
city
of
eastlake
that
this
court
looked
at.
mr.
edward
kramer
well,
the
ohio
court
in
both
cases,
justice
ginsburg,
first
ruled
that
it
was
an
administrative
matter.
mr.
edward
kramer
thank
you,
chief
justice.
