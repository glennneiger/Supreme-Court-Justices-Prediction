justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
your
difference
in
the
two
cases
is,
one,
you
have
an
official
action
taken.
we
deny
the
project.
here
you
don't
have
that.
but
suppose
there
had
been,
to
take
the
clearest
case,
a
tape
of
a
meeting.
the
mayor,
the
legal
director,
the
head
of
the
city
council,
they
all
got
together
and
say,
we
want
to
kill
this
project
and
we
know
that
the
most
effective
way
to
do
that
is
through
this
referendum
because
the
people
won't
like
it
and
they'll
vote
against
it.
so
they
have
a
deliberate
plan
to
string
the
thing
out
and
then,
as
the
last
act,
instigate
a
referendum.
and
as
i
take
it,
your
argument...
you
would...
you're
saying
even
if
you
have
that
scenario,
there
would
still
be
no
municipal
liability.
am
i
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it
was
racist,
sexist.
it...
it
had
to
do
with
was
it
administrative
or
legislative.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have...
do
you
have
any...
do
you
have
any
authority
to
say
that
there
is
discretion
to
reject
a
petition
that
is
properly
legislative?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose...
suppose
you
had
a
legislative
proposal
that
members
of
a
certain
race
will
never
be
included
in
any
kind
of
an
equal
opportunity
law.
suppose
you
had...
that
was
the
referendum.
is
there
any
authority
that
says
that
under
ohio
law,
that
couldn't
be
put
on
the
ballot?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
client
agreed
to
that.
your
client
didn't
make
any
objection
to
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said...
but...
but,
nonetheless,
he
didn't
contest
it.
then
you
say
the
whole
object
was
delay.
and
as
i
see
this
thing
unfold,
the
big
delay
is
during
the
pendency
of
the
referendum
because
it
was
at
the
end
of
february
when
the
planning
commission
got
this.
they
had
conditions
on
it,
but
it
acted
on
the
very
same
day.
the
ordinance
was
approved
on
april
1st.
as
things
go
in
the
zoning
area,
from
february
21st
until
april
1st
is
not
a
very
long
time,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
delay...
as
far
as...
that...
that's
not...
the
delay
that
you're
complaining
about
is
from
the
moment
the
petition
was
filed
for
the
referendum
until
when
he
finally
got
the
building
permits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
couldn't
have
expected
them
to
be
issued
the...
the
day
you
filed
the
site
plan.
i
mean,
there
has
to
be
a
meeting
of
the
planning
commission.
there
has
to
be
a
meeting
of
the
city
council.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
would
have
been
no
denial
of
the
building
permit
absent
the
referendum,
there--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
don't
you
know?
because
you...
there's
a
30-day
period.
there's
a...
the
city
council
acts
on
april
1st.
that
goes
into
effect
in
30
days
unless
there's
an
intervening
referendum.
so
that
you
would
have
had
by
may
1st
the
building
permits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that
was
in
the
30-day
period
when
they
couldn't
be
issued
because
it
hadn't
become
effective
yet.
the...
the
instruction
was
simply
what
the
law
was,
that
the
ordinance
approved
by
the
city
council
doesn't
become
law
until
30
days
after
that
approval.
so
that
the...
the
mayor,
to
that
extent,
was
just
telling
them
to
do
what
the
law
would
require.
but
in
understanding
your
complaint
and
how
you
are
tying
in
the
officials
to
the
referendum,
are
you
saying
that
absent
the
official
prompting,
instigation,
or
whatever
you
call
it,
that
there
would
never
have
been
a
referendum,
that
in...
in
fact
that
the
mayor
whipped
up
the
referendum?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
there
would
have
been
official
action.
and
that's
the
problem
here,
that
there...
do
you...
do
you
call
a
referendum
that's
put
on
the
ballot
because
10
percent
of
the
electorate
had
signed
petitions...
do
you
call
that
state
action,
which
is
subject
to
the
equal
protection
surveillance?
i
had
thought
that
that's
a...
that's
an
initiative
of
the
people
and
it's
not
action
of
the
city.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
say...
be
saying
that
if
the
ohio
court
had
stuck
to
its
original
position?
i
mean,
it
was
four/three
both
times.
