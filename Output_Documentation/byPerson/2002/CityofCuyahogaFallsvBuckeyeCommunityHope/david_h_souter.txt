david
h.
souter
now,
what
if
the
city
had
taken
the
same
official
action
that
it
took
in
this
case,
and
every
official
action
either
favored
or
was
at
least
neutral,
and
yet
the
city
officials
went
out
and...
and
whipped
up,
in
effect,
anti-black
sentiment
and...
and
urged
the
filing
of
the
application
for
the
referendum,
would
the
answer...
would
the...
would
the
result
be
the
same,
that...
that
there
would
be
no
way
that
the
city
could
be
held
liable?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the...
isn't
the
delay
simply
a...
even
the
delay
in...
in
an
instance
in
which
the
ordinance
is
defeated
simply
a
lesser
degree
of
damage,
but
which
would,
nonetheless,
be...
be
subject
to
a
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it...
there's...
there's
no
question
that
it...
it
would,
but
is...
is
the...
is
either
the...
the
statute
in
question
here
or
the
equal
protection
clause
blind
to
an
obvious
reason
for
the
delay?
in
other
words,
i...
i
quite
agree.
we
start
with
the
assumption
that
mere
delay
in
governmental
processes
does
not
give
rise
to
a
cause
of
action,
but
when
the
delay
is
induced
by
city
officials
for
a
racially
discriminatory
reason,
aren't
we
then
in
a
different
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
shouldn't
it
be
a
different
outcome?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
mechanism...
the
mechanism
is
provided
by
the
city
charter.
i
guess
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
if
city
officials...
let's
just
say
the
mayor,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
or
the
mayor
and
the
city
council...
in
effect,
do
not
establish
a
policy
in
the
sense
that
they
say,
we
want
to
stop
black
housing
projects,
but
they
follow
a
policy
of
trying
to
make
it
difficult
for
those
housing
projects
to
be
approved,
and
one
way
they
do
that
is
by
spurring
the...
the
request
for
referendums.
assuming
we're
going
to
apply
the
monell
rule
here,
isn't
that
a
policy
position
of
the
city
even
within
the
meaning
of
monell?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
kramer,
would
you
explain
to
me
what
exactly
you
think
the
relevance
of
the
subsequent
referendum
was?
for
example,
do
you
say
the
relevance
of
the
subsequent
referendum
to
your
claim
for
delay
in
issuing
the
permit
simply
is
the
evidence
that
it
furnishes
of...
of
racial
bias
ultimately
on
the
part
of
city
officials?
or
is...
is
its
relevance
that
it
increased
the
damages
otherwise
attributable
to
the
day...
delay
in
the
permit?
how
exactly
should
we
regard
the
referendum?
you...
you
understand
the
problem
that
we're
all
having
with...
with
it.
precisely
how
does
it
figure
in
your
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i...
i
understand
that.
if...
if
there
had
been
no
referendum,
no
petition
had
ever
been
filed
for
the
referendum
and
none
had
ever
been
held,
would
you
still
have
essentially
the
same
claim,
though
with
a
different
evidentiary
basis?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you...
i...
i
thought
your
claim
was
that...
that
you
would
still
have
been
delayed
in
being
issued
the
permits
and
that
you
would
still
have
had
a
claim
for
that.
am
i...
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
in...
in
the
absence
of
the
referendum,
how
long
would
that
have
been?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
what
your...
what
your
argument
boils
down
to
is
to
say
that
there
is
a
recoverable
substantive
due
process
violation
whenever
a
property
right
of
yours
is
interfered
with
by
a
misuse
of
the
legislative
process,
even
a
temporary
one.
isn't
that
the...
the
nub
of
your
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what...
from
the
standpoint
of
your
claim,
why
does
it
matter
whether
it...
it
was
a
legislative
use
countering
an
administrative
action,
or
whether
it
was
a
legislative
use
with
a
racial
motive?
it
is
an
improper
use
of
a
legislative
procedure.
and
you're
saying,
as
i
understand
it,
whenever
that,
in
fact,
is
effected,
there...
and...
and
you
can...
you
can
make
a...
a
colorable
claim
of...
of
some
economic
damage,
that
you
have
a
substantive
due
process
right
to
recover.
isn't
that
correct?
