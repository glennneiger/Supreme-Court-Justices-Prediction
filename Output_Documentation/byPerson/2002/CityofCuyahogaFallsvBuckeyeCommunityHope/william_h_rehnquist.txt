chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
01-1269,
the
city
of
cuyahoga
falls
versus
buckeye
community
hope
foundation.
mr.
nager.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
supposing,
mr.
nager,
that
you
have,
say,
a...
say,
a
seven-member
city
council
and
it's
confronted
with
a
project
like
this.
and
one
of
the
seven
members
of
the
city
council
says
that,
you
know,
he's
opposed
to
this
because
he
doesn't
want
african-americans
moving
into
this
area.
the
other
six
members
of
the
city
council
simply
treat
the
thing
on
the
merits.
does
the
action
of
this
one
individual
taint
the
whole
action
of
the
city?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're...
you're
talking
about
people
who
vote
in
a
referendum?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we...
we've
never
said...
we've
never
tried
to
examine
the
motives
of...
of
the
citizenry
who
vote
in
a
referendum
on
that
sort
of
question,
have
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
arlington
heights
was
a
city
council,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
nager.
mr.
salmons,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what...
what--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what...
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
the
petition
was
genuine
as
opposed
to
a
sham
in
these...
in
this
context?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
abuse
in
a
situation
like
this.
i
mean,
presumably
anybody
has
a
right
to
petition,
and
you
know,
the
fact
that
maybe
they
won't
get
the
necessary
votes
surely
doesn't
make
it
a
sham.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wait
a...
what
is--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you...
you
haven't
told
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
salmons.
mr.
kramer,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
kramer,
opposing
counsel
says
that
you
have,
in
effect,
abandoned
the
second
question
presented,
the
disparate
impact
question.
is
that
correct
or
is
it
not
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
didn't
the
lower...
the
lower
courts
didn't
adopt
that
proposition,
did
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
didn't
they
go
on
the
basis
that
the...
that
the
city
officials'
action
was
mandatory?
the
lower
courts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
didn't--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
that...
that's
a
question
of
ohio
law,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
way
you
sought
to
prove
it
was
to
get
an
affidavit
from
the
law
director
of
some
suburb
of
cleveland?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
it
rules
that
way
many
years...
many
years
after
this
case
was...
went
to
litigation,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
i
don't
believe
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
holding
in
hunter.
i
thought
in
hunter,
this
court
said
that
a
municipality
cannot
make
racial
laws
subject
to
referendum
and
no
other
laws,
which
is
quite
a
different
proposition
from
what
you
suggest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
permitted
it
30
years
ago,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kramer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nager,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nager.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-1269,
the
city
of
cuyahoga
falls,
ohio
verus
buckeye
community
hope
foundation
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
