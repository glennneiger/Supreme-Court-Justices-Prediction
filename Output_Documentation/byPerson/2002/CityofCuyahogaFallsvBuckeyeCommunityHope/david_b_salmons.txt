mr.
david
b.
salmons
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
challenge
only
the
delay
caused
by
the
city
charter's
neutral,
longstanding
provisions
facilitating
the
orderly
processing
of
citizen-initiated
referenda
to
review
ordinances
passed
by
the
city
council.
such
a
challenge
requires
courts
to
balance
the
vital
first
amendment
rights
implicated
in
the
referendum
process
with
the
equally
valid
goals
of
equal
protection
and
fair
housing.
in
this
case,
that
balance
is
clear.
the
city's
actions
in
giving
effect
to
the
properly
filed
referendum
petition
cannot
give
rise
to
liability
under
the
fair
housing
act
or
the
equal
protection
clause.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
referendum
petition
was
facially
neutral
and
that
numerous
reasonable,
non-racial
grounds
supported
it.
it
is
also
undisputed
that
the
city's
process
for
handling
such
petitions
was
longstanding
and
race-neutral.
under
any
conceivable
standard,
respondents
have
failed
to
provide
any
evidence
that
the
referendum
process
was
tainted
with
discriminatory
motive
either
on
the
part
of
the
city
officials
or
the
petition
organizers.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
yes...
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
to
be
sure,
the
analogy
to
the
noerr-pennington
line
of
cases
is
not
perfect
in
this
case,
but
it...
it--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--yes,
your
honor.
the...
the
approach
that
we
recommend
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
is
that
the
court
undertake
the
question
as
to
whether
the
petitioning
at
issue
was
genuine
or
whether
it
was
a
sham.
that's
the
same
type
of
analysis
the
court
has
undertaken--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--yes.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
there
are
two
ways
in
which
the
city
could
potentially
be
held
liable.
i
think
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
the
city
could
ever
be
held
liable
based
on
the
discriminatory
motives
of
the
referendum
petitioners
because
it's
clear
in
this
case
that
the
petitioning
was
genuine
and
this
isn't
a
sham.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
but
in
the
situation
where
you
do
have
a
sham--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i...
i
think
genuine
here
means
the
same
it
means
in...
in
the
other
contexts
in
which
the
court
has
used
the
sham
doctrine,
namely
that
it
was
about
the
first
amendment
activity.
the...
the
process
that...
that
the
city
here--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--certainly,
your
honor,
it...
in
the
event
that
you
have
a
referendum
that's
actually
enacted
into
law,
the
court
would
examine
it
in
the
way
that...
that
you
have
articulated.
we
thought
it
was
important
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
process
by
which
a
city
ordinance
is,
if
you
will,
stayed
pending
resolution
of
the
referendum
vote
is
a
traditional
and
important
part
of
the
process
for
referendums,
but
it
is
also
a
process
that
can
give
rise
to
abuse
if
you
have
a
petition
that
is
a
sham.
it's
not
about
the
first
amendment
process
at
all.
it's
simply--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--taking
advantage
of
the
delay.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that...
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor.
but...
but
i
think
there
are...
to...
to
get
back
to
the
original
question,
what
i'm
trying
to--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
let
me
just
say
that
there's...
there
would
be...
need
to
be
both
an
objective
and
a
subjective
component
to
the
sham
standard
as
there
is
in
other
contexts.
but
to
try
and
address
the
question
that
you
originally
posed,
it
does
seem
to
us
that
there
are
at
least
two
ways
in
which
the
city
can
be
held
liable
in
the
event
that
you
have
sham
petitioning.
one
would
be
that
if
the
city
officials
themselves
were
part
of
the
sham,
and
the
other
would
be--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
this
court's
sham
analysis
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
it's
actually
about
the
first
amendment
activity
or
it's
just
about
an
effort,
in
this
case,
to
take
advantage
of
the
delay
to
interfere
with
someone's
housing
rights.
we
think
that
same
analysis
can
apply
here
by
inquiring
as
to
whether,
first
of
all,
the...
the
referendum
petition
is
objectively
baseless.
is
there
any
way
that
that
petition
could
have...
be
enacted
into
law
and
enforced?
if,
for
example,
you
had
a
petition
that
said
no
minorities
shall
live
in
the
city
of
cuyahoga
falls,
clearly
that's
a
referendum
that
could
never
go
into
effect
and
never
be
enforced,
and
therefore,
it
may
be
strong
evidence
that
the
process
here
is
not
about
changing
a
law
of
the
city--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
i...
i'm
not
necessarily
saying
that
the
clerk
shouldn't
put
that
on
the
ballot,
but
that
would
be
one
part
of
the
analysis
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
process
was
being
abused
and
it
was
just
a
sham.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i...
i
think
that
very
well
may
be
strong
evidence
that
it
was
a
sham.
this
was
about
an
attempt
to
abuse
the
process.
it
wasn't
about
any
protected
first
amendment
activity.
and...
and
in
that
situation
i
think
there
is,
in...
in
addition
to
the
possibility,
although
i
think
perhaps
unlikely
that
you
can
hold
the
city
vicariously
liable
based
on
the
motives
of
the
citizens,
i
think
that
is
a
difficult
question
as
to
whether
the
actions
of...
of
the
referendum...
the
petition
signers,
the
10
percent
who
signed
the
petition
and
file
it,
whether
that
action
is
the
official
action
of
the
city
with
regard
to
the
petition
just
as
the
action
of
the
voters
at
the
referendum
vote
is
an
action
of
the
city
for
which
the
city
can
held
liable.
this
court
need
not
address
that
in
this
case.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
potentially,
your
honor.
i
think,
again,
the...
the
way
in
which
the
analysis
would
work
is
the
court
would
need
to
inquire
as
to
whether
the
petitioning
was
genuine
in
the
sense
that
there
was
a
genuine
effort
to
try
and
change
the
city's
ordinance.
and
if
so,
then
the
first
amendment
would
provide
immunity.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
but--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i...
i
think
you'd
need
to
examine
both
the
motives
in...
in
your
hypothetical
not
only
of
the
city
officials,
but
also
of...
of
the
petition
signers.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i'm
talking
about
the
liability
of
the
city,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
guess
the
short
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
even
people
with
racial
motives
have
the
right
to
petition
their
government
to
change
the
law.
and...
but
if
they...
what
no
one
has
the
right
to
do
is
abuse
the
process
in
order
to
interfere
with
someone's
fair
housing
and
equal
protection
rights.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
if
it
was
genuine
petitioning,
that
is
correct.
thank
you,
your
honor.
