mr.
craig
goldblatt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
individual
debtor
at
the
end
of
a
bankruptcy
case
will
typically
receive
a
discharge
of
that
debtor's
pre-bankruptcy
debts.
that
discharge,
however,
is
subject
to
a
number
of
statutory
exceptions,
each
exception
reflecting
a
congressional
judgment
that
a
particular
category
of
debt
be
paid
notwithstanding
the
prior
bankruptcy.
those
exceptions
include
not
only
debts
for
money
obtained
by
fraud,
debts
for
injuries
caused
by
drunk
driving,
and
amounts
due
for
alimony
and
child
support.
with
respect
to
the
fraud
exception
at
issue
here,
under
the
bankruptcy
code
and
this
court's
cases,
a
debt
is
nondischargeable
in
bankruptcy
if
the
creditor
can
establish
that
the
underlying
debt
arises
out
of
an
act
of
fraud.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
debt
that
would
otherwise
be
nondischargeable
for
that
reason
becomes
dischargeable
if
the
parties
enter
into
a
settlement
agreement
that
resolves
the
amount
of
the
debt.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
a
settlement
did
have
that
effect,
emphasizing
that
the
effect
of
a
settlement
was
to
trade
a
fraud
claim
for
a
contract
action
that
would
be
discharged
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
no,
your
honor.
the
question
of
dischargeability
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
that
is
how
each
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
addressed
the
question
has
treated
it.
indeed,
this
court,
in
grogan
versus
garner,
has
emphasized
that
the
construction
of
section
523(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
did,
indeed,
say
that
the...
the
settlement
effected
a
novation.
that
is
a
common
rule.
i'm
unaware
of
any
jurisdiction
in
which
that...
that
wouldn't
be
the
principle.
the
question,
nevertheless,
before
this
court
is
the
effect
as
a
matter
of
federal
bankruptcy
law
of
that
settlement.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
from
north
carolina,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
yes.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
unaware
of
any
jurisdiction
in
which
a
settlement
doesn't
effect
novation.
when
the
parties
to
a
dispute
settle
that
dispute,
it
is
commonly
the
case
that...
indeed,
in
every
jurisdiction
of
which
i'm
aware,
following
that
settlement,
the...
the
creditor
or
the
plaintiff
is
unable
to
bring
a
new
lawsuit
for
fraud.
rather,
the
party
is
left
to
enforce
the...
the
settlement.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
it
was
an
immediate
payment
of
$200,000
and
a
promissory
note
for
$100,000.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
your
honor,
leonard
warner
stipulates
that
the
debt
is
nondischargeable
as
to
him.
with
respect
to
mrs.
warner,
it
would
remain
our
burden
in
bankruptcy
to
show
that...
that
there
is
an
act
of
fraud
that
is
properly
attributable
to
her,
either
because
she
committed
it
herself
or
by
some
principle
of
agency
that
it
is
nondischargeable
because
of
her,
so
i...
i
don't
believe
that
the...
the
stipulation
by
its
terms
is...
is
dispositive
on
the
question
of
whether
it
is
nondischargeable
as...
as
to
her.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
i...
i
believe
that...
that's
a
final
and
unappealable
order
at
this
point,
and
yes,
that's
right,
of
course.
petitioners
assert
that
they
have
the
right
as
a
matter
of
federal
bankruptcy
law
also
to
continue
to
recover
on
this
debt
as
against
mrs.
warner,
who
also
is
an
obligor
on
the
promissory
note.
on
the
essential
point
that,
justice
ginsburg,
you
were
making
with
respect
to
the
holding
below,
the
description
you
offered
is...
is
exactly
right.
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
novation.
it
is
true
that
the
underlying
claim
of
fraud
has
been
released,
but
just...
that
was
equally
true
in
this
court's
decision
in
brown
versus
felsen.
in
brown,
the
parties
to
a
state
court
litigation
resolved
that
litigation
by
agreeing
to
the
entry
of
a
consent
judgment.
it
was
as
equally
true
there,
as
it
is
here,
that
the
parties
who
had
been...
whose
litigation
had
ended
in
the
consent
judgment
were
barred,
in
that
case
by
the
preclusive
effect
of
the
consent
judgment,
here
by
the
binding
effect
of
the
settlement,
from
bringing
a
new
suit
claiming
fraud.
all
they
could
do
was
enforce
the
consent
judgment.
nevertheless,
this
court
held
in
a
unanimous
opinion
in
brown
versus
felsen
that
in
bankruptcy,
the
creditor
nevertheless
had
the
right
to
seek
to
establish
that
the
underlying
debt
arises
out
of
an
act
of
fraud,
and
the...
the
reason
this
court--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--well,
yes,
justice
stevens,
that's
right,
and
here
what...
what
petitioners
seek
to
do
is
go
behind
the
settlement
agreement--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--and
see
what
the
settlement
actually
resolved.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
well...
well,
for
each
particular
debt
that
one
asserts
is
nondischargeable,
the
creditor
bears
the
burden
of
proving
in
bankruptcy
that
that
debt
arises
out
of
an
act
of
fraud.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
that's
right,
but
nevertheless,
under
brown
versus
felsen,
that
is
the
creditor's--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--if
the
original
indebtedness
arises
out
of
an
act
of
fraud,
justice
scalia,
then...
then
yes,
it
is
all
debt--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--justice
scalia,
we...
we
certainly
acknowledge
that
there
must
be
some
principle
of,
say,
proximate
causation.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
there
certainly
is
a
principle
of
proximate
causation.
you...
you
need
to
show
that
there
is
a
direct
connection
between
the
act
of
fraud--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--no,
justice
breyer,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
is
never
a
point
in
which
the
causation
becomes
too
tenuous
that
you
can't
prove
that
the
debt
that
one
is
contending
is--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--but
not...
not
only
is...
is
the
principle
of--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--exactly.
it's
not
just
a
question
of
but-for
causation,
but
as
in
common
law,
proximate
causation.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
your
honor,
here,
all
that
happened
is
that
the...
the
form
of
the
debt
changed.
the
parties
entered
into
a
settlement
agreement
in
which
they
changed
the
debt
from
an
unliquidated
cause
of
action
for
fraud
into
a
liquidated
promissory
note.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
that...
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
all
a
creditor
seeks
to
do
in
showing
a
debt
as
nondischargeable
is
seeks
to
enforce
the
debtor's
promise
to
pay
the
amount
of
money
given
in
that
settlement.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
that's--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--just
a
couple
of...
of
answers.
first,
it...
it
doesn't
terminate
the
proximity
any
more
than
the
consent
judgment
in
brown
versus
felsen
might
have
terminated
the
proximity
in
that
case.
it's,
of
course,
true
that
a...
a
consent
judgment
operates
as
a...
extinguishes
the
prior
cause
of
action
and
the
claims
merge
into
the
consent
judgment.
nevertheless,
this
court
said
in
brown
versus
felsen
that
notwithstanding
the
preclusive
effect
of
that
judgment,
a
creditor
has
the
right
in
bankruptcy
to
establish
that
the
debt
is
traceable
to
fraud,
and
what
it
said
is--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--presumably
yes,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--that's
right,
and
unless
the
creditor
can
prove
in
bankruptcy
that
the
debt
that's
now
reflected
in...
in
the
settlement
agreement
is
traceable
to
an
act
of
fraud,
the
creditor
will
lose
the
nondischargeability
action,
and
the
only
question
is
whether
the
creditor
should
have
the
opportunity
to
establish
in
bankruptcy
that
there
is,
in
fact,
an
act
of
fraud
that...
that
is
reflected
in
and
resolved
by
the
consent
judgment.
the
consent
judgment
says
expressly...
it
doesn't
say
there's
no
fraud.
it
says
that
this
is
a
compromise
of
disputed
claims,
and
in
exchange
for
the
release,
what
the
creditor
got
was
a
clear
carve-out
from
that
release
for
the
right
to
enforce
the
$100,000
of
debt
that's
reflected
in
the
promissory
note.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
that's
right.
the
settlement--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--but
it
is
completely
silent
on
the
question
of
whether
fraud
had
occurred,
just
as
the
consent
judgment
in
brown
v.
felsen
was
completely
silent
on
the
question
whether
that
debt
arose
out
of
contract
or
fraud.
in
brown,
this
court
said
that
the
creditor
has
the
opportunity
to
look
behind
the
fraud...
to
look
behind
the
settlement
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
for
fraud,
and
there...
there's
no
difference
here.
your
honor--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--justice
souter--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--justice
souter,
that
would
be
a
much
harder
case
for
reasons
we
set
out
in...
in
our
briefs.
we
contend
as
a
matter
of
bankruptcy
policy
there
are
reasons
why
such
an
agreement
shouldn't
be
enforced,
but
that
would
certainly
be
a
much
more
difficult
case
than
this
one.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
that's...
that's
exactly
right,
justice
souter.
the
way
this
works
in
bankruptcy
is
that
when
the
creditor
files
for
bankruptcy
with
this
promissory
note
outstanding
for
a
hundred-and-some-thousand
dollars,
the
creditor
comes
into
bankruptcy
and
files
a
proof
of
claim
saying,
i
have
a
claim
of
a
hundred-and-somethousand
dollars,
and
i'm
entitled
to
my
pro
rata
distribution
on
that
hundred-and-some-thousand
dollars.
the
proof
of
claim
is
on
page
82
of
the
joint
appendix.
no
one's
contending
that
the
release
bars
the
creditor
from
seeking
recovery
on
the
amount
of
that
debt.
the
only
question
is
whether
they
can
receive
recovery
in
the
full
amount
of
the
debt
by
showing
it's
nondischargeable,
or
whether
they're
limited
to
simply
the
cents
on
the
dollar
that
the
claim
will
pay
in
bankruptcy,
because
the
text
of
the
bankruptcy
code
makes
clear
that
the
form
of
the
debt
doesn't
matter,
that
a
debt...
that
under
section
523,
a
debt
can
take
any
number
of
different...
under...
i'm
sorry.
under
section
523
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
any
debt,
the
code
says,
is
nondischargeable
if
it's
traceable
to
an
act
of
fraud,
and
the
code
defines
debt
very
broadly
to
include
debts
that
are
liquidated,
unliquidated,
reduced
to
judgment,
et
cetera.
it's
quite
clear
the
form
of
the
debt
doesn't
matter,
unless--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--that's
right,
justice
scalia,
and
with
respect
to
that
question
there
is...
there
is
no
difference
between
a
consent
judgment
that
is
a
final
adjudication
of
the
claims
between
the
parties
and
a
settlement
agreement,
both
of
which
are
equally
preclusive,
both
of
which
are
equally
silent
on
the
question
of
whether
fraud
occurred.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
okay.
thank
you.
i
only
have
four
points.
first,
with
respect
to
the
state
law
question
of
preclusion,
we
say
in
our
reply
brief
on
pages
7
and
8
that
that
issue
had
been
waived.
i
don't
want
to
belabor
that
point,
but
i...
i
will
point
out
that
the
brief
respondent
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is...
which
is,
of
course,
in
the
record
here,
states
state
law
correctly.
there,
on
page
29
in
the
court
of
appeals
respondent
said,
there
is
no
issue
of
collateral
estoppel
in
this
case
because
there
have
never
been
any
evidentiary
findings.
we
submit
that's
a
correct
statement
of
state
law.
none
of
the
north
carolina
cases
cited
by
respondent
involved
a
case
in
which
a
settlement
agreement
is
given
preclusive
effect.
second,
with
respect
to
the
language
of
this
particular
release,
it
would
certainly
present
a
harder
case
if
you
had
a
situation
which
the
release
said,
we
give
up
all
of
our
rights
in
bankruptcy,
and
in
the
event
you
file
for
bankruptcy,
we
will
not
make
any
effort
to
collect
on
the
debt.
this
release
is
quite
far
from
that,
and
expressly
preserves
the
right
at
all
points
to
recover
on
the
amount
that
was
promised
in
the
promissory
note,
and
this
court's
opinion
in
brown
makes
clear
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
what
a
nondischargeability
action
is
is
simply
an
action
to
enforce
the
obligations
that
were
promised
as
part
of
the
settlement.
finally,
the
question
of
the
form
of
the
debt,
and
whether
the
form
of
the
debt
drove
the
decision
below,
there...
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
does
say...
and
this
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
8...
i'm
sorry,
page
9a,
footnote
8.
it
explains
quite
clearly
that
a
basis
for
its
decision
is
the
notion
that
the
creditor
was
substituting
the
tort
claim,
the
fraud
claim
for
a
contract
claim
and
rests
its
decision
on
that
basis.
the
consequence
of
that
decision
would
be
that
from
the
creditor's
perspective,
if
a
creditor
has
an
unliquidated
claim,
and
this
applies
not
only
to
claims
for
fraud
but,
say,
an
injury
caused
by
drunk-driving,
any
of
the
categories
of
nondischargeability,
if
you
have
an
unliquidated
claim
and
they
file
for
bankruptcy,
you
can
contend
its
nondischargeable.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
you've
litigated
all
the
way
to
judgment,
under
brown
you
can
say
in
bankruptcy,
even
if
the
judgment
doesn't
say
what
it's
for,
that
that's
nondischargeable.
it
would
create
an
anomalous
situation
in
which
the
middle
category,
cases
that
are
resolved
in
settlement
agreements
that
don't
resolve
the
question
of
liability,
the
rights
in
bankruptcy
to
show
nondischargeability
is
given
up,
and
because
the
code
makes
clear
that
the
form
of
the
debt
is
irrelevant
to
persons
of
dischargeability,
and
because
this
court's
decision
in
brown
versus
felsen
is
essentially
indistinguishable
from
this
case,
we
submit
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
we
agree
that...
that--
mr.
craig
goldblatt
--your
honor,
we...
we
agree,
as
we
say
in
our
reply
brief,
that
the
principal
basis
of
the
decision
below
has
been
abandoned
by
respondent
here,
and
we
believe
it's
been
abandoned
because
it
can't
be
squared
with
this
court's
decision
in
brown
versus
felsen,
which
holds
squarely
to
the
contrary.
mr.
craig
goldblatt
your
honor,
what
congress
was
doing
in...
in
sections
(a)(11)...
i...
i
see
my
time
has...
has
run
out,
but
what
congress
was
doing
in
(a)(11)
and
(a)(19)
was
giving
preclusive
effect--
