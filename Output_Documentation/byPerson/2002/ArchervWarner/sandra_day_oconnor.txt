ms.
blatt,
what
is
your...
what
is
the
government's
position
if
the
parties
had
expressly
dealt
with
it
in
the
settlement
agreement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
don't
agree
with
petitioner's
counsel
that
it's
a
harder
case,
but
wouldn't
give
it
up?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
now,
the
language
in
this
particular
settlement
agreement
gave
up
claims
arising
out
of
or
relating
to
the
matter
of
the
state
court
litigation.
was
that
not
a
waiver
of
this
claim?
