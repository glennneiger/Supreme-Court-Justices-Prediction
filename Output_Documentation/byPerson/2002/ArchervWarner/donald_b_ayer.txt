mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
make
four
points
this
morning.
the
first
one,
to
pick
up
on
what
justice
o'connor
said,
i
think
there's
a
fundamental
misconception
in
the
question
as
it's
presented
and
as
it
was
described
by
mr.
goldblatt
this
morning,
and
this
conception
is
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
categorical
rule
that
says
that
whenever
you
have
a
settlement,
because
it's
a
contract,
it
bars
any
further
pursuit
of
a
nondischarge
claim.
that
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
holdings
of
the
court
below,
all
of
which
looked
specifically
at
the
language
of
the
release
and
concluded
that
what
had
specifically
been
released
was
the
right
to
pursue
the
claim
under
523.
second--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--correct,
your
honor,
and...
and
that
leads
to
the
second
point,
which
is
that
what
is
at
issue
here
really
is
the
interpretation
of
the
language,
the
specific
language--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
you
said
in
terms
of
the
language
is
certainly
correct.
i
think
the
important
issue
is
that
this
is
a
settlement
and,
indeed,
there
is
also
a...
a
voluntary
dismissal
with
prejudice
in
a
state
court
case.
i
would
submit
the
proper
analysis
of
that
is
to
interpret
the
settlement
under
state
law
and
then
ask
the
question,
is
there
some
problem
with
federal
bankruptcy
law
that
requires
you
to
somehow
override
what's
been
agreed
to
or
what's
been
done
in
state
court.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i...
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
it
is
the
final
answer,
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
entirely
possible
for
parties
in
a
state
court
proceeding
to
enter
into
a
settlement
that
says,
and
we
hereby
specifically
release
our
523
claim,
and
had
that
been--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think...
i
guess
my
point,
your
honor,
is
that
the
question
of
whether
they
expressly
agreed
to
it
becomes
a
question
of
interpretation,
and
i
would
like
to
get
to
arguing
that
they
did,
in
fact,
expressly
agree
to
it.
the
first--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i...
i
think
brown
versus
felsen
certainly
expressed
the
view
that
they
didn't
want
to
encourage
people
to
have
to
affirmatively
determine
fraud
in
state
court
when
it
had
been,
in
fact,
been...
been...
the
issue
of
nondischargeability
had
been
put
into
the
bankruptcy
court,
but
nothing
in
brown
versus
felsen
in
any
way
qualifies
the
proposition
that
parties
can,
in
a
state
court
proceeding,
resolve,
for
example,
by
trial
an
issue
of
fraud
that
would
be
preclusive
under
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
but
it
does,
your
honor,
address
it
in
the
sense,
and
then
grogan
confirms
that
collateral
estoppel
does
apply,
so
that
if
you
have
a
state
proceeding--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--your
honor,
under
this
court's
matsushita
decision,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
in
order
to
determine
whether
there's
issue
preclusion,
you
have
to
look
at
the
state
law
in
the
state
where
the
judgment
is
entered,
and...
and
the
state
law,
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
in
north
carolina
is
that
if
you
have
a
voluntary
dismissal
with
prejudice
under
the
miller
building
case,
under
the
barnes
case,
that
voluntary
dismissal
with
prejudice
resolves
the
issues
that
were
put
in
issue--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
disagree,
your
honor.
the...
the
thomas
mcinnis
case
that
you're
referring
to
is
a
case
where
what
actually
happened
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
whether
prejudgment
interest
was
available
was
that
a
husband,
in
litigating
that
issue,
in
fact,
failed
to
timely
raise
it,
and
when
he
failed
to
timely
raise
it,
the
wife
was
subsequently
collaterally
estopped
from
pursuing
it.
there's
one
sentence
in
the
thomas
mcinnis
case
that
says,
we
apply
the
usual
principles
of
collateral
estoppel.
there
are
multiple
cases,
your
honor,
in
north
carolina
that
are
entirely
clear
that
the
rule
is
that
if
you
have
a
voluntary
dismissal
with
prejudice,
that
voluntary
dismissal
is
determinative
as
though
the
matter,
and
this
of...
almost
a
quote,
as
though--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
guess
what...
what
i
would
like
to
suggest
to...
to
the
court
is
that
what
we
do
have
here
is
a
settlement
of
a
state
court
litigation
followed
by
a
voluntary
dismissal
with
prejudice,
that
the
effect
of
that,
of
those
acts,
including
the
language,
because
that's
what
the
courts
here...
all
three
of
these
courts
focus
specifically
on
the
precise
language,
and
they
concluded
that
that
language
was
a
waiver.
i
would
submit
that
was--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--the...
the
miller
building
case
and
the
barnes
case,
both
of
those
cases
involved
collateral
estoppel.
it
was
invoked
by
a
new
party,
and
it
was
clearly
based
upon
the
fact
that
the...
that
the
matter
had
been...
in
one
case,
it
was
a
voluntary
stipulation
with
prejudice.
the
other
was
a
voluntary--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
don't
believe
you
can
tell
from
the
opinion,
and
that's
not,
certainly,
what
they
rely
on.
the
principle
that
is
stated
in
those
cases
in
a...
in
a
categorical
way,
and
i
can...
i
can
read
it
to
the
court,
is
that...
let's
see.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i...
i
think,
your
honor,
there
are...
there
are
many
federal
court
cases
that
recognize
that
a
matter
which
is
not
actually
litigated
in
the
sense
that
it
went
to
trial
and
was
determined
after
a
trial
or
a
fact-finding.
if
the
parties
intend
for
a
settlement
agreement
to
be
preclusive,
and
that
is
incorporated
into
a
judgment,
that
will
have
collateral
estoppel
effect,
and
that's
what
happened--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--we
are.
i'm
simply
trying
to
point
out
that
the
notion
that
there
is
some
sweeping,
overarching
general
law
that
says
it
always
must
be
actually
litigated,
that
that,
in
fact,
is
not
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
what...
let
me
suggest
to
the
court
a...
a
way
in
which
this
was
clear.
first
of
all,
i...
i
do
really
want
to
emphasize
that...
that
all
three
of
the
opinions
of
the
court
below,
none
of
them
adopt
this
sort
of
categorical,
it's
a
contract,
therefore
the
right
is
waived
approach.
that
is
not
the
issue
in
any
of
these
cases.
they
all
look
at
the
specific
language,
and
they
reason
to
the
conclusion.
the...
the
court
of
appeals,
for
example,
specifically
said
that,
quote,
a--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--let's
see,
here.
page
10a
of
the...
of
the
appendix.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
the
petition
appendix.
they
said,
in
invoking
the
novation
concept,
it's
necessary--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--it's
actually...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
it's...
it's
9a.
if
you
look
at
the
end
of
the
first
paragraph,
under
the
novation
theory,
courts
need
only
address...
wait
a
minute.
i'm
sorry,
the
top
of
the
page
on
9a.
when
following
the
novation
theory,
the
terms
of
the
settlement
should
be
examined
to
determine
whether
the
nondischargeability
claims
were
released.
the
rest
of
that
page
is
an
examination
of
the
terms,
and
if
you
look
over
onto
the
next
page,
10a,
they
quote
the
west
case,
which
says,
a
promissory
note
does
not
discharge
the
underlying
obligation
unless
the
parties
expressly
release
and
substitute
the
new.
that
is
what
these
cases
are
all
about,
all
three
of
them,
and
the
question
of
whether
the
settlement
released
the
claim
is
a
question,
i
would
submit,
in
the
first
instance...
not
in
the
last
instance,
but
in
the
first
instance,
it's
a
question
of
state
law,
and--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right,
but
your
honor,
the...
the
holding
of
all
the
courts
below
went
beyond
what
your
honor
is
saying.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--let
me...
let
me--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
let
me
refer
the
court,
for
example,
to
35a
of
the
petition
appendix,
where
it
is
stated
that,
quote,
by
including
in
the
release
future
claims--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--this
is
the
opinion
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
i'm
just
trying
to...
this
was
the
consistent
analysis
in
all
of
these
courts.
by
including
in
the
release
future
claims,
the
court
concludes
that
the
plaintiffs
effectively
released
and
extinguished
the
dischargeability
claim
which
they
now
seek
to
assert.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
whether...
whether
this
is
a
different
issue
than
you
granted,
i
guess...
i...
i
agree
that
the
question
as
it
was
presented
in
the
petition--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--is
most
easily
read
as
this
broad,
blanket
rule.
that
is
not--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i...
i
think...
i
think
there
is...
i
think
the
ultimate
question,
and
the
last
question
and
the
fourth
question
i'm
hoping
to
get
to,
and
i
will
get
to
now,
is
the
question
of,
if...
if
you
agree
with
me
for
purposes
of
argument
that
initially,
you
look
to
see
what
the
state
settlement
does
and,
indeed,
here
also
what
the
effect
under
state
law
of
the
voluntary
discharge
with
prejudice
is...
voluntary
dismissal
with
prejudice
is,
and...
and
you
see,
as
these
courts
below
held,
that
the
effect
is,
in
fact,
to
give
up
the
right,
then
the
question
is,
is
there
something
about
federal
bankruptcy
law
or
policy
that
prevents
parties
from
voluntarily
agreeing
to
do
that?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
it
would
depend,
your
honor,
what
was
in
the
consent
judgment.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i...
i
think
it
would
become
a
question
of
whether,
under
the
laws
of
the
place
where
the
consent
judgment
is
entered,
the
fact
that
there's
a
settlement
that
is
somehow
appended
to
that
order,
if
it's
appended,
whether
that
becomes
limiting
or
defining
of
the
terms
of
what's
agreed
to.
if
all
you
have...
i
would
agree
with
this.
if
all
you
have--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--there's...
there's
no
discussion,
your
honor.
in
fact,
what's
pretty
clear
in
brown
versus
felsen,
and
the
critical
difference
between
brown
and
this
case
is
that
there
was
no...
there
was
no
kind
of
any
release
of
a
fraud
claim.
you
simply
had
the
settlement,
and
the...
the
creditor
got
paid,
and...
and
nobody
had
yet
proven
affirmatively
that
there
was
fraud.
what
this
court
said
is,
on
those
facts,
you
get
to
come
in
and
prove
fraud.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i...
i
am
at
least
conceding
that
there's
no
waiver
of
the
right
to
argue--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
it...
it--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--your--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--if
it
amounts
to
a
clear
concession
that
there
was
fraud,
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
okay.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
in
consideration
of--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i...
i
would
say--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
would...
i
would
say
that
that
is
non...
that
is
not
nondischargeable
without
affirmatively
proving
fraud,
although
you
would--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
you--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that
leaves--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--it
is
not
non...
it
is--
[laughter]
it
is
not
clear
from
the
hypothetical
that
it
is
nondischargeable,
but
it
is
certainly
not...
you
have
the
opportunity
to
come
into
bankruptcy
court
and
prove
fraud.
your...
your
hypothetical
does
not
establish
fraud.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
absolutely.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
in
the
respect--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--in
the
respect
that
our
case
included
language
which
was
interpreted
by
all
three
of
these
courts
as
a
release...
under
state
law
as
a
release
of
the
right
to
go
to
bankruptcy
court
and
pursue--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--the
reason
it's
in
the
question
presented
is
because
it's...
it
is
the
holding
of
the
case
below.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
the
case
below
doesn't--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
guess
what
i
would
say
is
that
that
question
is--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
that's
right.
the
answer
is
maybe,
and
it
depends--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--and
what
it
depends
upon
is,
has
there
been
a
basis
on
which
to
conclude
that
that
right
has
been
given
up,
and
the
answer
is
that
no
such
basis
arises
simply
because
there's
a
settlement
contract.
we
do
not
claim
that,
and
neither
did
any
of
the
courts
below.
there...
there's
nobody
here
in
this
courtroom
or
in
this
case
who
says,
that's
the
rule
of
law.
that
you
can
say
it's
not
the
rule
of
law
and
everybody
will
agree
with
you,
but
that's
not
the
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
one
reason
why,
and
this...
this
gets
back
to
my
point
that
i
think
you
have
to
take
a
state
court
settlement
under
state
law
first
to
understand
it,
this...
this
settlement,
among
the
other
language
of
releases
which
we've
talked
about,
also
includes
language
that
commits
to
filing
a
voluntary
dismissal
with
prejudice.
now,
as
i've
indicated,
in
order--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
it
may
or
may
not,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case
in
north
carolina,
under
north
carolina
law,
under
miller
building
and
barnes,
when
you
file
a
voluntary
dismissal
with
prejudice,
it
is
as
though
the
matter
were
litigated
to
a
conclusion
and
the
plaintiff
lost,
and--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right.
it's--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
your...
your
honor,
that...
that
is
the
law
in
many
places.
that
is
not
the
law
in
north
carolina,
and
i
simply...
i
know
this
court
doesn't
spend
its
time
deciding
state
law
issues,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i...
i
think
the
rules
are
somewhat
similar.
i've
not
studied
them
to
know
how
precisely
parallel
they
are.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
let
me...
let
me
just
quote,
because
i...
i've
found
it...
the
language
in
miller
building
and
barnes
is
that
a
voluntary
dismissal
with
prejudice,
quote,
precludes
subsequent
litigation
to
the
same
extent
as
if
the
action
had
been
prosecuted
to
a
final
adjudication
adverse
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
the
language
of
the
release
is
quite
clear.
the
language
of
the
release
talks
about
releasing
any
and
all
rights,
including
future
rights.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
let
me--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well...
and
let
me
suggest,
your
honor,
that...
that
in
order--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
and
the
parties--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--but
i
think
we
know
under
arizona
v.
california
and
other
decisions
that
parties
can
do
that
if
they
in...
if
they
indicate
an
intention
to
do
it,
and
the
question
is,
have
they
done
that
here.
let
me--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think...
i
believe
it's
not,
and
i
really
feel--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
believe
it's
a
question
of
state
law.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
absolutely.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
and
let
me
address,
if
i
could,
what
i
view
as
the
logical
way
to
think
about
this.
once
you
have
a
state
contract
that
is
given
meaning
under
state
law,
the
question
is,
is
that
somehow
to
be
modified
or
overridden
in
light
of
federal
bankruptcy
policy,
and
what
we
have
here,
on
the
other
side,
i
think,
are
two
different
views.
we
have
one
view
of
the
petitioners
that
it
can
never
be
done,
there's
no
way,
bankruptcy
policy
won't
allow
it,
and
the
other
view
of
the
government
is
that,
well,
you
can
do
it
if
it's
clear
enough,
and
then
you
get
into
nice
questions
of
what,
i
guess,
our
federal
common
law--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--your
honor,
i
think
all...
all
our
approach
does
is
allow
parties
to
enter
into
settlements
to
be
given
what
effect
they
have.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
what
it...
i
mean,
i
guess
the
next
question
would
be,
what
else
might
be
adequate,
and
do
you
really
want
to
develop
a...
a
body
of
federal
law.
let
me,
if
i
could,
just
point
to
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
why
this
should
be
treated
as
essentially
a
federal
override
of
state
law
interpretive
principles
is
based
first
upon
citation
of
a
number
of
express
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
and,
i
think,
prove
the
opposite
point.
there's
a
whole
section
on
debtor
reaffirmations
which
set
up
detailed
procedures
that
the
bankruptcy
court
enforces
to
make
sure
that
debtors
don't
get
taken
advantage
of,
and
they
are
specific,
and
they're
clear,
and
the
bankruptcy
court
follows
them.
that's
an
occasion
for
the
bankruptcy
court
to
get
involved.
there's
the
idea
that
the
automatic
stay
cannot
be
voluntarily
given
up.
again,
that's
the
product
of
specific
language
that
creates
an
automatic
stay
to
protect
the
debtor
and
has
18
itemized
exceptions,
specific
language.
there...
they
invoke
the
preference
provisions
which
let,
of
course,
the
bankruptcy
court
go
back
into
transactions
that
occur
prior
to
bankruptcy,
and
look
at
them
on
very
specific
terms
set
forth
in
section
547.
they
talk
about
the
fraudulent
conveyance
section
does
the
same
thing
in
a
slightly
different
way,
but
there
are
no
such
provisions
whatsoever
with
regard
to
waivers
of
section
523
claims.
section
523
claims
are
something
that
the
creditor
loses
if
he
does
not
affirmatively
file
within
60
days
of
the
first
meeting
of
creditors.
there
are
no
protections
with
regard
to
that
in
the
code,
and
if...
if
something
isn't
filed,
they
disappear.
indeed,
the
whole
idea
that
creditors
are...
that...
that
the
issues
with
regard
to
nondischargeability
under
(a)(2),
(a)(4),
(a)(6),
and
(a)(15),
are
made
a
matter
of
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction,
the
reason
for
that,
and
your
case
and
brown
talk
specifically
about
that,
is
because
creditors
were
abusing
the
process
by
pursuing
them.
this
is
not
a
protection
for
creditors.
this
is
a...
a
way
of
making
sure
creditors
don't
come
in
after
bankruptcy
and
basically
put
the
screws
to...
to
debtors
who
have
gotten
a
discharge.
what
language
there
is...
and
we
talk
about
this
in
both
the
briefs,
i
think
specific
language
runs
counter
to
this.
we
talked
in
the
briefs
about
(a)(11)
and
(a)(19),
which
specifically
mention
settlements,
and
i
would
submit
the
better
interpretation
of
that
language
is
to
say,
in
those
instances
where
the
language
specifically
says
that
any
settlement
may
give
rise
to
a
nondischargeable
claim,
is
to
allow
the
bankruptcy
court
to
go
back
in
and
look
at
those
facts
even
if
the
right
to
a
nondischarge...
right
to
pursue
nondischarge
was
given
away.
i
think
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
relate
to
a
series...
they
don't
relate
to
any
language
of
the
code,
other
than
the
much
overbroad
idea
that
it...
that
it's
any
debt,
and
of
course
that
doesn't
mean
that
a
party
can't
be
foreclosed
from
litigating
the
523
claim
because
he's
already
lost
it
in
state
court,
so
any
doesn't
mean
absolutely
every.
the
policies
that
are
invoked
are,
first,
the
honest
but
unfortunate
debtor
policy,
but
nobody
here,
i
think,
seriously
suggests
that
a
party
can't
give
the
thing
away,
give
the
right
away
if
they
want
to,
and
so
i
think...
give
the
right
to
pursue
the
523
action
away
by
clear
enough
language.
that
seems
to
be
the...
the
petitioner
i
think
disagrees
with
me,
but
other
than
that,
i
think
the
better
view
is
that
they
can,
and
i
don't
think
this
court
in
any
of
its
cases
has
ever
suggested
that
the
honest
but
unfortunate
debtor
policy
forecloses
relying
on
prior
resolutions
under
state
law.
collateral
estoppel
certainly
applies,
and
we
think
settlement
language
that's
clear
ought
to
apply.
they
claim
that
allowing
this
is
some
sort
of
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
it
would
be
a
trap
if
the
rule
were
this
categorical
rule
that
says,
boy,
you
enter
into
a
settlement
contract,
you
lose
your
523
claim.
that's
not
the
issue
in
the
case.
the
issue
is,
does
the
language
here
support
the...
the
idea
that
the...
the
right
to
pursue
the
523
claim
has
been
given
up,
and
to
hold
parties
to
the
state
law
effect
of
releases
that
they
sign
is
no
trap
for
the
unwary.
that's
how
we
do
litigation
in
this
country
every
day.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
three
was
the
state
law
point.
i...
i
guess...
three
was
the
point
that
when
you
look
at
state
law
here,
the
reading
of...
the
fair
reading
of
state
law
does,
indeed,
support
the
state
law
rulings
of
all
three
of
the
courts
below,
and
point
four,
of
course,
is
that
there's
no
reason
in
federal
law
to
go
back
and
say
no,
we
have
to
second-guess
that.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i'm
not
aware
of
it,
your
honor.
they
certainly
can
if
they
want
to.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
your
honor.
