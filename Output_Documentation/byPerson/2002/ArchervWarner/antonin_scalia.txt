suppose
i
have
an
indebtedness.
i'm
running
a
business
and
i
have
one
indebtedness,
and
in
order
to
cover
the
payments
for
that
indebtedness,
i
incur
a
second
indebtedness
which
i
otherwise
would
not
have
incurred,
is
that
traceable
to
fraud?
justice
antonin
scalia
anything
that
happens
later
is...
that...
that
wouldn't
have
happened
but
for
the
original
indebtedness
is,
within
the
terms
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
traceable
to
the
fraud?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly,
and
that's
all
we're
talking
about
here,
isn't...
isn't
it?
how...
how...
you
know,
how
far
down
the
line
do
we
carry
traceable
to,
and
does
a
novation
end
the
traceability,
but
you...
you
have
to
acknowledge
it
has
to
end
somewhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
in...
in
connection
with
that,
one
side
said
to
the
other,
i
don't
care
whether
this
has
come
out
of
fraud
or
not.
regardless
of
whether
it
came
out
of
fraud,
i'm
going
to
give
you
this
money,
and
we'll
be
quits.
why
isn't
that
enough
to
terminate
the
proximity,
because
the
averment
of
both
parties
is,
never
mind
fraud,
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
fraud,
we're
going
to
settle
this.
whether
there
was
fraud
or
whether
there
wasn't
fraud,
you
get
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true,
but...
but
here
it
was...
there
was
no
acknowledgement
of
the
fraud.
it
was
given
with
the
averment
that
this
debt
does
not
hinge
upon
fraud.
this
debt
is
just
to
settle
this
controversy
between
us
whether
there
was
fraud
or
whether
there
wasn't
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
enough
to
terminate
the
proximity
necessary
for...
for
nondischargeability
in
bankruptcy?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
doesn't
a
consent
judgment
always,
at...
always
hinge
upon
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
a
settlement
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
there's
no
fraud,
but
it
does
say
that
this
indebtedness
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
there
was
fraud.
whether
or
not
there
was
fraud--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
indebtedness
exists.
it
seems
to
me
it
severs
the
connection
between
the
fraud
and
the
indebtedness.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
traceability
does,
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here,
how
traceable
is
traceable.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
talking
issue
preclusion,
just...
just
as
far
as
whether
it
suffices
to
terminate
the
traceability.
that...
that
isn't
necessarily
coextensive
with...
with
whether
there
was
issue
preclusion.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
like
a
strange
result,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
conduct
this
big
inquiry
and
find
out
that
the
guy's
been
defrauded
of
$300,
and
then
that
the
settlement
agreement
really
covers
up
a
fraud
and
you
say,
well,
but
you
know,
a
deal's
a
deal.
even
though
you
defrauded
him
of
it
and
the
whole
thing's
traceable
to
fraud,
we're
only
going
to
give
you
$200,000.
that's
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no,
no.
no,
the
settlement
agreement
was
just
an
arm's-length
agreement,
but
if
you
find
that,
in
fact,
the
debt
underlying
that...
that
agreement
was
fraudulently
obtained,
having
gone
through
all
the
trouble
of
determining
that
fact,
why
don't
you
make
the
guy
cough
up
all
the
money
that
he
got
by
fraud?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
answering
the
question.
you
just
want
to
answer
it,
maybe,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
sometimes
yes,
sometimes
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask...
this...
this
puzzles
me.
is
it,
indeed,
a
question
of
federal
law
whether
a
contract
which...
which
gives
up
all
future
rights
in
connection
with
this
claim
includes...
whether...
whether
the
contract
includes
the
right
to
claim
nondischargeability?
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
is
that
a
federal
question
or
a
state
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you...
you
think
it's
a
question
of
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
question
of
federal
law
what
the
consequence--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
that
state
contract
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
rather
unfortunate,
mr.
goldblatt,
that
there's
nobody
in
the
room
to
defend
the
position
that
i
understood
was
taken
by
the
question
presented,
namely
that
a
novation...
a
novation
is
all
you
need.
i
think
that's,
at
least,
an
arguable
position,
but...
but
nobody...
nobody
seems
to
want
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--discuss
the
issue
on...
on
which
we
took
the
case.
