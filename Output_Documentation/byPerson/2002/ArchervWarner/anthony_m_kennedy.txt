justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
understanding
that
if
the
fourth
circuit
were
correct
and
were
to
be
affirmed
in
this
case,
that
its
rule
would
be
the
generally
prevailing
rule
in
all
of
the
states,
or
would
certain
states
differ
on
whether
or
not
there
was,
in
effect,
a
novation
when
there
was
a
settlement
agreement?
would
we
have
to
go
state-by-state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
my...
my
question,
perhaps,
was
not
as
clear
as
it
ought
to
have
been.
the
fourth
circuit
placed
substantial
reliance
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
novation
under
state
law,
that
there
was
a
new
debt
created
superseding
the
old,
et
cetera,
and
my
question
is
whether
or
not...
if
we
affirm
its
judgment,
that
we
will
find
in
almost
every
other
state
a
settlement
is
also
a
novation,
or
will
the
rule
vary
from
state
to
state,
and
if
it
does
vary
from
state
to
state,
will
the
fourth
circuit
rule
from
this
particular
state
be
the
majority
rule
or
minority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm...
i'm
well
aware
of
that,
but
what
i'm
just
asking
is...
this
case
came
from
south
carolina,
was
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
from
north
carolina.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
north
carolina
rule
about
novations
and
settlements
the
majority
rule
for
most
of
the
states?
in
most
states,
would
this
be
called
a
novation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
what's
the
policy
reason
behind
that.
i
mean,
if...
if
what
we're
concerned
about
is
vindicating
the
federal
policy
that
the...
the
bankruptcy
code
protects
only
honest
debtors
and
not
dishonest
debtors,
why
not
give
them
the
whole
$300,000?
i
mean,
i...
i
know
brown
didn't
do
that,
but
why
didn't
it
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
fourth...
the
fourth
circuit
says
state
law
says
that
this
is
a
novation,
too,
so...
and
you're...
you
don't
want
us
to
be
bound
by
that
interpretation
of
state
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
going
to
be
the
same
in
every
state,
which
is
what
i've
asked.
the
very
first
question
we
asked,
or
i
asked,
was
whether
or
not
this
was
a
rule
depends
on
the...
the
vagaries
of
the
law
of
north
carolina
or
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
would...
i
would
have
to
agree
with
what
justice...
justice
ginsburg
seems
to
be
indicating,
that
this...
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
there's
issue
preclusion
as
to
an
issue
that's
never
been
litigated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
astounding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
suppose
after
this
case,
no
matter
which
way
it
goes,
you
can
have
an
archer
clause
in...
in
the
settlement
agreement.
i...
i've
never
seen
a
settlement
agreement
in
which
the
parties
agree
that
it's
going
to
be
nondischargeable.
as
a
matter
of
common
course,
do
these
clauses
appear
in
contracts,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
know
they
can.
