ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
creditor
settles
a
fraud
claim
without
resolving
the
disputed
issue
of
fraud,
the
creditor
has
the
right
to
enforce
the
settlement
debt
for
the
full
amount
in
bankruptcy
by
filing
a
proof
of
claim
and
by
establishing
fraud
in
response
to
the
defense
of
dischargeability.
that
conclusion
is
confirmed
by
brown,
which
held
that
a
creditor
who
settles
a
fraud
claim
by
consent
judgment
may
establish
fraud
in
response
to
a
bankruptcy--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
court
in
brown
did
two
things.
the
court...
the
question
of
fraud
was
not
litigated
in
brown
because
the
case
was
settled,
and
the
court
mentioned
in
its
last
footnote
that
there
would
be
a
different
situation
if
the
question
of
fraud
was
actually
litigated.
the
question
before
the
bankruptcy
court
in
brown
is
whether
the
money
owed
under
that
consent
judgment
was
money
obtained
by
fraud.
so,
too,
the
exact
same
question
is
relevant
here.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
not...
a
dismissal
with
prejudice
following
a
settlement.
as
this
court
stated
in
lawlor
versus
national
screen
service,
it's
cited
in
the
reply
brief
at
page
9,
is
that
it
has...
does
not
have
preclusive
effect
on
the
disputed
issue
unless
the
judgment
is
accompanied
by
specific
findings
on
the
disputed
issue,
and
that's
the
classic
requirement
for
issue
preclusion
or
collateral
estoppel,
that
the
matter
be
actually
litigated.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no,
the...
the
dismissal
with
prejudice
doesn't
impair
the
creditor's
right
to
walk
into
court
and
sue
to
enforce
the
settlement
debt,
including
the
right
to
try
to
get
the
full
amount
of
the
settlement
debt
in
bankruptcy,
and
on
this
issue
of
traceability,
it...
it
is
not
only
identical
to
brown,
but
the
code
by
its
express
terms
disclaims
any
distinction
between
a
liquidated
debt
and
an
unliquidated
debt.
the
settlement
in
brown
and
the
settlement
here
converts
an
unliquidated
fraud
claim
into
a
liquidated
claim
to
collect
on
the
settlement
debt.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
under...
under...
he
would
be...
the...
the
creditor
would
be
bound
by
the
settlement
agreement
under
principles
of
state
law
that
the
amount
of
his
debt
would
only
be
the
$200,000.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i'm
sorry,
are
you
talking
about
the
settlement
agreement
itself
was
procured
by
fraud?
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
court...
the
court
addressed
this
very
issue
in
brown.
the
creditor
there
did
not
get
a
fraud
judgment
for
exemplary
damages
and
special...
special
damages
under
state
law.
he
was
limited
to,
in
bankruptcy,
of
just
seeking
this
settlement
debt,
and
what
the
bankruptcy
code
does
is,
it
gives
the
creditor
a
statutory
right
to
render
that
settlement
debt
nondischargeable
if
fraud
can
be...
can
be
shown.
you
don't...
and
there's
another
way
of
looking
at
it,
too.
the
court--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--the
court
in
grogan...
it's
because
of
two
issues,
justice
kennedy.
under
state...
state
law
determines
the
amount
of
the
debt
that
is
owed,
and
there's
just
no
question,
at
least
i
don't
think
that
the
creditor
could
make
an
argument
that
he's
owed
any
more
than
$300,000.
he
can't
relitigate
and
try
to
get
up
to
$600,000.
that's
just
governed
by
state
law.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the...
again,
this
court
in
grogan
versus
carter
said
that
state
law
determines
the
amount
of
the
debt,
and
i
just
don't
think
the
creditor
would
have
a
good
faith
argument
that
he
could
go
beyond
the
settlement
agreement,
but
on
the
question
of
nondischargeability,
what
the
creditor
is
trying
to
do
is
collect
the
entire
amount
of
the
debt
by...
by
showing
fraud,
and
we
think
applying
brown--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
this
court
already
crossed
that
bridge
in
brown.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
but
the
second
point
is
that--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--whatever
the
limits
of
the
traceability
point,
which
this
court
addressed
in
a
separate
decision,
cohen
versus
de
la
cruz,
which
dealt
with
the
traceability
aspects--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--the
code
itself
says
that
any
enforceability
obligation,
whether
or
not
it's
liquidated
or
unliquidated
or
appears
in
a
judgment,
if
you
can
prove
that
there
has
been
a
fraudulent
acquisition
of
money,
the
resulting
debt
is
nondischargeable,
and
that
is--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--we
think
the
right
would
be
subject
to
waiver.
we
don't
think...
we
don't
see
anything
in
the
code
that
would
be--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--we
think
the
right
can
be
waived.
what
we
do
think,
though--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no,
it
certainly
wasn't
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
collect
on
the
debt,
and
in
fact
there's
an
express
preservation
of
not
only
the
right
to
collect
all
the
obligations
under
the
promissory
note,
but
to
collect
the
amounts
under
the
settlement
agreement,
and
we
think
to
apply
a
contrary
rule,
the
rule
that
the
court
below
applied,
would
be
unsound
for
three
reasons.
it
would
force
creditors
and
parties
trying
to
settle
a
case
to
start
negotiating
over
bankruptcy
contingencies
that
are
purely
hypothetical,
may
never
happen,
and
are
entirely
extraneous
to
the
settlement.
the
rule
adopted
by
brown
also,
our
second
point,
is
that
it
reflects
the
common
sense
and
ordinary
understanding
that
settlements
preserve
the
creditor's
right
to
enforce
the
settlement
agreement
and
the
statutory
right
to
prove
fraud
to
render
the
debt
enforceable,
notwithstanding
bankruptcy,
and
that
has
been
the
premise
of
hundreds,
if
not
thousands
of
settlement
agreements
entered
into
by
the
government
that
do
not
refer
to
bankruptcy
contingencies.
third,
to
hold
that
those
settlement
agreements
waive
the
creditor's
rights
in
bankruptcy
would
render
debts
dischargeable
even
where
the
debtor
committed
fraud,
and
that
result
would
undermine
congressional
policy
to
favor
the
rights
of
innocent
victims
of
fraud
over
the
perpetrators
of
fraud.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes,
if
there
was
an
affirmative
manifestation
of
an
intent.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
because
there
is
a
background
presumption,
justice
stevens,
that
rights
are
subject
to
waiver,
and
so
if
there's
an
intentional
relinquishment
of
a
federal
statutory
right,
then
a
court
can
give
that
effect,
but
not
only
is
there
silence
on
that
issue
in
this
case,
there
is
an
express
reservation
of
the
right
to
enforce
the
settlement
agreement,
and--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes,
and
that
includes--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--they're
not
suing
for
fraud.
they're
suing
to
collect
on
the
settlement
agreement
for
the
full
amount
in
bankruptcy.
by
asking
the
bankruptcy
court,
not
only
by
filing
the
proof
of
claim,
but
to
render
the
debt
survivable
and
enforceable
in
bankruptcy.
it's
no
different
than
the
settlement
judgment
in...
in
brown.
