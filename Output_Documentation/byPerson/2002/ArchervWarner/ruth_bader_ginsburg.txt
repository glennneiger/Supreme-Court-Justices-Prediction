ruth
bader

mr.
goldblatt,
i
take
it
you're
saying,
yeah,
a
novation
is
fine
with
you.
no
longer
do
they
have
the
original
claim.
they
have
substituted
for
it,
what
the
claim
is,
the
amount
of
the
settlement.
the...
what
was
it,
immediate
payment
of
x
dollars?
was
it
2,000?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's...
that's
what
they...
they
say
is
the
basis
of
their
claim
in
bankruptcy.
they
think...
they
know
they
can't
go
back
to
the
original
claim.
to
that
extent,
it's
a
novation.
that's
not
disputed.
but
there
is
one
element
of
the
background
of
this
case
perhaps
you
can
clarify
for
me.
it's
odd
that
leonard
warner
stipulated
that
this
was
a
nondischargeable
debt,
but
his
wife,
who's
in
the
bankruptcy
with
him,
says
yes,
it
is
dischargeable.
what
is
the
effect
of
the
stipulation
by
leonard
warner
that
this
debt
is
nondischargeable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
does
that
mean
that...
let's
say
the
fourth
circuit
is
affirmed,
that
you
could
still,
post-bankruptcy,
go
after
mr.
warner
because
he
stipulated
that
the
debt
as
to
him
was
nondischargeable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
didn't
look
to
what
the
court
had
decided,
but
what
the
claim
was
about,
but
here
we
have
something
in
addition.
there
is
a
judicial
order.
there
was
a
complaint
filed,
and
it
was
dismissed
as
part
of
the
settlement.
that
complaint
in
the
court
action
was
dismissed
with
prejudice.
what
effect
should
that
have?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
no
language
about
523,
which
you
just
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
is
a
standard
settlement.
it's
a
compromise.
neither
side
is
admitting
anything.
one
side
is
not
admitting
fraud,
and
the
other
side
isn't
saying
we've
proved
fraud.
it's
just
a
zero
on
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there's...
there's
no
collateral
estoppel
here.
that
argument
absolutely
dumbfounded
me,
frankly,
because
for
collateral
estoppel,
issue
preclusion,
you
must
have
raised,
actually
litigated,
there
must
be
a
court
determination
of
the
issue,
and
that
determination
must
be
essential
to
the
judgment.
you
don't
have
any
actual
litigation
here,
so
i
don't
know
how
you
can--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
only
decision
that
you
cite
from
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
says,
we
go
down
the
line
with
what
is
the
standard
understanding
of
issue
preclusion,
actually
litigated,
decided,
and
essential
to
the
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
would
certainly
run
entirely
against
the
stream,
and
it
would
run
against
the
restatement
of
judgments,
which
you
cite,
and
that
says
you
must
manifest...
yes,
parties
can
make
a
stipulation
finding.
they
can
do
it
in
a
consent
judgment
just
as
they
can
in
the
settlement,
but
they
have
to
make
that
manifest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
does
not
infer
that
an
issue
that
was
never
litigated
was,
in
fact,
decided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
read
you
the
language
from
mcinnis,
which
is
the
north
carolina
supreme
court?
it
was
not
just
simply
a
statement
that,
we
recognize
issue
preclusion
in
its
traditional
guise.
it
was,
issue
preclusion
does
not
apply
unless,
quote,
the
prior
suit
resulted
in
a
judgment
on
the
merits,
identical
issues
are
involved,
the
issue
was
actually
litigated,
the
issue
was
actually
determined.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
carolina.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i...
no,
no,
we
made
it
plain,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
here
that
the
parties
can
stipulate,
and
the
stipulation
will
have...
will
have
the
same
effect
as
a
finding,
but,
as
the
restatement
of
judgments
points
out,
that
must
be
made
manifest.
you
don't
imply
it
from
words
that
don't
say,
and
we
stipulate
that
this
claim
is
going
to
be
dischargeable
in
bankruptcy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
there's
no
dispute
that
the
settlement
released
the
claim.
there's
no
dispute
that
there
was
a
novation
here.
there's
no
dispute
that
they
no
longer
have
the
original
fraud
claim.
they
have
a
claim
only
on
the
promissory
note
that
they
got
as
a
result
of
the
settlement,
so
it...
they're...
they're
not
claiming,
oh,
we
can
go
back
to
the
day
we
filed
our
fraud
complaint.
they're
saying,
we
have
a
debt
here,
a
promissory
note,
and
that
is
the
sum
total
of
what
we
can
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
words
that
you
read--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
simply
supportive
of
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
can't...
you
can't
get
anything
more
than
the
amount
of
the
promissory
note
that
results
from
the
settlement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
go
back
just
one
step?
suppose
this
settlement
had
been
entered
as
a
consent
judgment,
just
as
was
the
case
in
brown
against
felsen,
what
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nothing.
the
court
just
enters...
there's...
the
parties'
settlement
is
incorporated
in
the
consent
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't...
in...
in
brown
against
felsen,
there
wasn't...
the
settlement
was
not
on
the
record?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
that
was
true,
certainly
true
as
far
as
claim
preclusion
goes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
claim-precluded,
but
you
constantly
mixed
up--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--claim
preclusion
and
issue
preclusion--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
yes,
a
voluntary
dismissal
with
prejudice
is
preclusive
of
that
claim.
you
can
never
bring
that
claim
again,
but
it
resolves
no
issues.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
haven't
seen
a
single
north
carolina
supreme
court
decision
that
so
holds,
that
a
voluntary...
i
thought
that
north
carolina
rules,
by
the
way,
were
based
on
the
federal
rules
with
respect
to
the
voluntary
dismissal
rule.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
the
voluntary
dismissal
is
claim-preclusive
but
not
issue-preclusive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
the
(a)(11)
and
(a)...
the
19,
the
express
provisions
for
nondischargeability?
