justice
david
h.
souter
would
there
be...
would
there
be
a
difference
if
the
settlement
had
expressly
said,
we
stipulate
that
there
was
no
fraud
leading
to
the
creation
of
the
debt
of...
for
which
this
in
effect
is
a...
a
novation?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
argument
here
is
we
don't
really
have
get
to
bankruptcy
policy.
there
simply
has
not
been
an
agreement
which
eliminates
the
fraudulent
character
of
the
debt.
is
that
basically
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
their
main
argument,
i
think,
on
the
other
side
is,
you
get
a
debt,
that's
what
it
is,
a
debt
for
money
obtained
by
fraud,
and
this
is
not
a
debt
for
money
obtained
by
fraud,
this
is
a
debt
for
money
owed
under
a
settlement
agreement.
now,
the
virtue
of
that
is,
it's
a
bright
line,
and
what
we're
saying,
i
think,
in
the
negative...
the
negative
of
it
is
that
if
you
depart
from
that,
well
there's
no
end
to
it.
you
have
a
settlement
agreement,
and
no
matter
how
long
you
go
into
the
future,
whatever
it
is,
that...
whatever
it
says
you're
supposed
to
do
in
that
settlement
agreement,
it
is.
use
the
words
proximate
cause,
use
whatever
they
want,
but
it
is
a
debt.
where
it
comes
from
is
the
fraud.
that's
where
the
source
of
the
debt
is,
no
matter
what
it
says
in
that
settlement
agreement,
and
there's
just
no
stopping
place,
no
way
to
look
into
it,
no
attenuation
forever,
et
cetera,
so
that's
what
i'd
like
you
to
here
address.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
all
right,
so
then
maybe
brown
was
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
it
was
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't...
isn't
the
problem
with
approaching
it
that
way...
i...
at
least,
i
think
the
problem
with
approaching
it
that
way
is
that
there
is
no
state
law
analog
to
the
issue
that
is
being
raised
here.
in
other
words,
under...
under
state
law,
there
was
a
fraud
claim,
there
was
a
settlement
of
the
fraud
claim,
but
there
is
no
issue
under
state
law
about
bankruptcy,
and
that
is
strictly
a...
a
federal
policy--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i
don't
know
how
we
get...
we...
we
look
to
state
law
to
find
out
whether
there
is
doubt
or
not,
but
i
don't
know
why
state
law
should
be
a
source
of
an
answer
to
this
federal
question,
which
is
peculiarly
federal.
justice
david
h.
souter
they...
they
might
be
able
to...
i
mean,
i'll
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
they
might
be
able
to
do
that,
but
in...
in
that
case,
the...
the
issue
here
would
be
resolved,
on...
on
your
theory,
certainly,
by
the
express
agreement
with
the
parties,
and
they
didn't
do
that,
so
we've
got
a
case
in
which
they
didn't
agree
on
the
issue
expressly,
and
i
don't
see
why
state
law,
which
doesn't
have
the
issue,
is
a
good
place
to
look
for
the
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
they
concluded
that
it's
a
waiver
of
claim,
and
we
don't
have
any...
i
presume
no
one
has
a
problem
with
that.
the
question
is
whether
there
is...
is
a
waiver
on
the
disputed
fact
issue,
and...
and
my...
my
question
to
you
is,
you...
you
refer
to
the
myriad
state
law
cases
that
hold
in
your
favor.
is
it
clear
that
those
are
cases
on
issue
preclusion--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
opposed
to
claim
preclusion--
justice
david
h.
souter
--or
res
judicata?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
was
it
a
stipulation
that...
that
expressly
addressed
the...
the
fact
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
taking
your
terms,
everybody,
i
guess,
agrees
that
if
the
settlement
agreement
said,
we
agree,
the
two
parties,
that
there
was
no
fraud
involved
in
the
creation
of
the
debt
which
this
agreement
settles,
that
that
would,
in
fact,
be
preclusive,
that
they
could
not,
in
fact,
prove
fraud
and...
and
nondischargeability.
why
is
the
settlement
here
like
the
settlement
i
just
described,
because
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
your
argument.
there's
no
legal
difference
between
the
settlement
we've
got
here,
which
says
nothing
about
fraud,
and
the
settlement
that
i
described
in
which
fraud
is
expressly
addressed.
why
are
the
two
alike?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't...
isn't
that
what
any
neither
party
settlement
does?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
that--
--so
far
as--
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
mr.
ayer,
let's
assume
that
that
particular
reason
isn't
necessarily
going
to
persuade
all
of
us
here.
do
you
have
another
reason
to
say
that
the
agreement,
the
settlement
here
should
be
treated
in
law
by
this
court
under
the
bankruptcy
code
just
like
a
settlement
that
expressly
says
there
wasn't
any
fraud?
do
you
have
any
other
reason?
