justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait,
but
what
about...
i
mean,
this
doesn't
make
too
much
sense
to
me.
you
say,
a
owes
b
$100,000
because
of
a
fraud
that
a
committed
against
b,
so
they
settle
it,
and
they
say,
our
settlement
arrangement
is
the
following.
we
enter
into
a
new
business
called
macy's
department
store,
and
many
years
later
there's
another
debt
between
the
partners
arising
out
of
buying
furniture
for
macy's
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
fraud,
and
now
you're
saying
that
that
debt's
going
to
be
never
dischargeable
because
the
cause
of
macy's
was
the
fraud?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i...
absolutely.
macy's
would
never
have
been
created
but
for
the
debt,
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
never
would
have
had
this
furniture
argument
but
for
the
debt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
does
that
mean,
proximate
cause,
then?
what's
the
difference
between
this
case
and
macy's?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no
traceability.
there's
never
a
problem.
underlying
this
was
the
fraud.
whatever
it
says
in
that
settlement
agreement
is
based
on
fraud.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
a
new,
different
issue
than
we
granted,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
that's...
the
question,
i
take
it,
is,
we're
assuming
there's
a
novation,
there's
a
settlement,
and
fine,
and
that
settlement
says,
i
promise
to
pay
$200,000,
so
it's
a
debt.
it's
a
debt
for
money,
and
the
question
is,
is
it
a
debt
for
money
obtained
by
actual
fraud?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
so,
how
do
we
characterize
that
debt?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
it
was,
but
it
was
released.
i...
i
don't
see
that
we
reach
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i...
i
would
assume
that
the
text
and
the
wording
here
that
you're
relying
on,
and
the
rule
of
the
state
about
a
novation
and
so
forth,
are...
are
prevalent,
not
universal,
but
are...
are
the
standard
form
of...
of
settlement
and
release
in
almost
every
state,
and
apparently
the
novation
rule
is
standard
as
well,
so
the...
the
result
that
you're
asking
us
to
reach
is
that
this
also
forecloses
any
federal
characterization
of
this
as
being
a
debt
incurred
by
fraud,
and...
and
that's
a
very
sweeping
statement,
and
a
very
sweeping
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
you're...
you're
then
conceding
the
following,
is
that
right,
that
if,
in
fact,
i
owe
you
$300,000
because
i
cheated
you
by
fraud,
we
then
enter
into
a
settlement
which
might
be
approved
by
the
court,
assume
it
is,
and
what
that
settlement
says
is,
in
light
of
what
you
claim
i
did
to
you,
cheat
you
through
fraud,
i
promise
to
pay
$200,000,
and
you
are
conceding
that
that's
all
there
is
to
the
case,
that
that
is
nondischargeable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
want
to
know
on
my...
the
facts
i
just
gave
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
your
opinion--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
200,000
debt
nondischargeable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
what
i'm
saying
is,
you
have
the
facts
i
gave
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
remember
what
they
were.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
said
it
was
$300,000
obtained
by
fraud.
i
said,
i
will
settle
that
by
entering
into
this
piece
of
paper
which
says,
i
promise
to
pay
200.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
approved
by
the
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are...
there
are
too
many
negatives
in
your
statement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
lost.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
give...
remember
my
example.
i
want
to
say,
in
your
opinion,
is
that
nondischargeable,
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
okay,
but
you're
saying
you
have
an
opportunity--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
prove
the
fraud?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
your
case
is
different
from
that
in...
i
gave
in
which
respect?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
release?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
and
the
reason
that's
in
the
question
presented
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
that
a
debt
shall
not
be
dischargeable,
and
that
means
the
debt
survives
bankruptcy
”to
the
extent”
it
is
for
money
obtained
by
fraud.
now,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether,
the
words
that
i
have
just
read,
can
cover
a
debt
under
an
agreement
that
settles
and
releases
an
earlier
fraud
claim,
and
we
hold
that
it
can.
the
case,
in
essence,
presents
the
following
circumstance:
a
sues
b
in
state
court
for
money
obtained
by
fraud,
a
and
b
then
settled
the
lawsuit.
the
settlement
agreement
provides
that
a,
here
said,
that
b
would
pay
a
$300,000,
but
b
paid
only
$200,000,
then
b
went
bankrupt,
and
a
says
this
remaining
$100,000
debt
survives
bankruptcy
because
it
is
for
money
obtained
by
fraud.
b
says
“no
it
is
not,
it
is
not
the
money
obtained
by
fraud
rather
it
is
for
money
promised
in
a
settlement
agreement”.
now,
the
lower
courts
agreed
with
b;
they
said
this
settlement
agreement
worked
a
novation,
it
erased
whatever
old
debt
there
was
for
fraud
and
it
substituted
a
new
debt
which
is
really
a
contract
debt
and
it
is
that
new
debt
which
is
not
for
money
obtained
by
fraud,
so
it
is
dischargeable
in
bankruptcy.
we
do
not
agree
with
that
view.
in
our
view
you
do
not
have
to
choose
one
or
the
other
characterization,
you
do
not
have
to
say
either
for
fraud
or
for
contract,
the
debt
could
be
both
a
contract
related
debt,
which
is
embodied
in
a
settlement
agreement
and
it
could
also
and
more
basically
be
a
debt
for
money
obtained
by
fraud.
at
least,
for
the
settled
case
itself
was
about
fraud.
this
conclusion
in
our
view
follows
from
an
earlier
supreme
court
case
called
brown
versus
felsen,
there
the
court
essentially
held,
as
we
see
it,
that
the
debt
embodied
in
a
consent
decree
could
amount
to
the
debt
for
money
obtained
by
fraud
as
well
wherefore
example
the
case
where
the
consent
decree
ended
was
a
fraud
case.
we
cannot
find
any
significant
difference
between
the
consent
decree
in
brown
and
the
settlement
agreement
here.
in
both
instances,
we
would
follow
congress's
desire
that
bankruptcy
court
makes
the
fullest
possible
inquiry
to
ensure
that
all
debts
arising
out
of
fraud
are
accepted
from
discharge
no
matter
what
their
form.
for
these
and
other
reasons
set
forth
in
the
opinions,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
we
remand
for
further
proceedings.
