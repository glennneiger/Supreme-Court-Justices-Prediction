well,
of
course,
there
it
wasn't
just
the
underlying
debt.
it
was
trying
to
find
out
what
the
judgment
actually
decided.
they
were...
they
were
able
to
go
beyond
the
terms
of
the
judgment
to
determine
what
the
judgment
actually
resolved.
i'm
not
quite
sure
it's
exactly
parallel--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
settlement...
they
had
gone
along
with
the
settlement,
and
then
they
came
up
with
a...
a
third
proposal
where
the
debtor
said,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
going
to
be
able
to
meet
my
obligations,
but
i've
got
another
proposal,
we'll
go
in
the
joint
venture
to
do
something
else
and
we'll
release
the
contract
claim
and
substitute
a
third,
could
you
go...
still
continue
to
go
behind
to
find
out
what
the
original
source
of
the
debt
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
even
if,
say,
they
had
five
or
six
different
transactions,
each
of
which
purported
to
be
a
complete
substitute
for
the
deal
they
had
just
been
unable
to...
you
can
always
go...
say,
well,
the
whole
thing
started
because
you
cheated
me
out
of
something?
justice
john
paul
stevens
directly
or
indirectly
out
of.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
real
inquiry
in
brown,
as
i
read
it,
is
can
we
go
behind
a
judgment
to
see
what
was
actually
determined
by
the
judgment.
it
wasn't
any
emphasis
on
the
settlement
aspect
of
it,
as
i
read
the
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
guess
the
holding
is,
yes,
you
may
go
behind
a
judgment
to
see
what
was
decided,
and
that
seems
to
me
a
little
different
from
going
behind
a
settlement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
would
you
just
clear
up
one
thing
for
me?
say
the
fraud
claim
was
for
$300,000
and
the
contract
was...
the
novation
was
$200,000,
in
the
bankruptcy
court
do
you
contend
they
can
get
the
full
300
or
just
the
200?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
that.
why
shouldn't
he--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree
that
some
fraud
claims
could
be
waived
as
far
as
the
dischargeability,
because
you
wrote
the
rights
settlement
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
that
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
policy,
just
as
this
case
would
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
enforce
the
settlement
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
a
reservation
of
the
right
to
sue
for
fraud.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ayer,
may
i
ask
you
this
question:
you
started
out
telling
us
you
were
going
to
make
four
points.
i
know
what
one,
two,
and
four
are,
but
i'm
just
curious
as
to
what
three
was.
