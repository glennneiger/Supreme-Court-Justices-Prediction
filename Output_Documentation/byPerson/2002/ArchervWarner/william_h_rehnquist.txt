we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
01-1418,
a.
elliott
archer
versus
arlene
l.
warner.
mr.
goldblatt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
talking
not
just
about
cause,
but
proximate
cause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldblatt.
ms.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
brown
decide
two
separate
issues?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
ayer,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
would
have
been
a
release
in
state
court
proceedings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
brown
versus
felsen
suggest
some
discouragement
to
the
idea
of
anticipatory
litigation
in
state
courts
of
issues
that
would
arise
in
bankruptcy
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
doesn't
qualify
the
proposition.
it
doesn't
address
the
proposition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
relying
on...
i
thought
you
were
relying
on
north
carolina
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
page?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereabouts
on
the
page
are
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
is
this
from,
this
is
the
opinion
of
the
bankruptcy
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
it
isn't
in
the
question
presented,
that's
what
i
thought.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the...
the
question
presented,
mr.
ayer,
is
whether
a
debt
that
would
otherwise
be
nondischargeable
becomes
dischargeable
if
the
parties
enter
a
settlement
agreement
under
which
the
amount
of
the
debt
is...
it
literally
doesn't
say
anything
about
fraud
or
collateral
estoppel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
view,
mr.
ayer,
would
simply
encourage
anticipatory
litigation
of
issues
that
might
arise
in
bankruptcy,
which
i
think
brown
suggests
is
not
a
good
idea.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but,
i...
i
think
here,
too,
probably
there's
general
agreement.
if
in
so
many
words
you
say
in
the
state
court
settlement,
i
waive
my
right
to
claim
nondischargeability
in
bankruptcy,
probably
everybody
would
say,
or
a
majority
would
say
yes,
but
you
don't
have
that
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ayer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goldblatt,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldblatt.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-1418
archer
against
warner
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
