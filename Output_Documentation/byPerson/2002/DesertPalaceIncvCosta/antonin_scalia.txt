the
first...
the
first
of
those
three
is...
goes
beyond
what
the...
what
the
government...
the
eeoc
guideline
would
require,
doesn't
it?
as
i
understand
the
eeoc
guideline,
it
doesn't
require
that...
that
the
indication
come
from
a
decisionmaker.
justice
antonin
scalia
although
the
fact
that
it
has
to
bear
upon
the
decision,
it's
hard
to
get
there
without--
justice
antonin
scalia
--pinning
it
on
a
decisionmaker
somehow.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is...
it
is
unquestionably...
it
was
unquestionably
made
in
price
waterhouse,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
what
it
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
--concurring
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
that
was
enacted,
was
there
already
a
considerable
body
of
court
of
appeals
opinions
which
had
interpreted
price
waterhouse
as
establishing
the
direct
evidence
rule,
or
did
they
come
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
do
you...
what
do
you
respond
to
the
argument
made
by
the
government
if...
that
if
that
is
what
it
means
and
if
it
does
not
embody
the
understood
requirement
of
direct
evidence,
it
effectively
supplants
(a)(1).
it...
nobody
would...
would
try
to
prove
a
case
under
(a)(1),
which
is
what
has
been
the
traditional
approach.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you...
you
accept
that
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
are
still
contradictory.
i
mean,
(a)(1)
would
require
in
a
mixed-motive
case...
okay...
if...
if
you
apply
(a)(1)
to
a
mixed-motive
case,
it
would
require
the
plaintiff
to
show
that
the...
the
improper
motive
was
an
effective
cause
and
that
the
employer
would
not
have
dismissed
this
person
anyway.
whereas,
if
the
new
2(m)
governs,
it's
just
the
opposite.
once
you
show
an
improper
motive,
it
is
up
to
the
employer
to
show
that
if
he
wishes
to
get
off,
he
would
have
taken
the
same
action
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
stands
mute,
he...
he
loses.
i
mean,
under
mcdonnell
douglas,
if
the
plaintiff
comes
in
with...
with
a
claim
that
this
was
the
motive
and
the...
and
the
defendant
doesn't
come
up
with
anything,
he
loses,
doesn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
any
case
that
goes
forward
is
a
mixed-motive...
is
a
mixed-motive
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
also
should
have
said,
i
believe
this
is
a
mixed-motive
case,
not
i
believe
this
is
not,
shouldn't
you?
you
had
a
bad
morning
i
think.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
okay.
