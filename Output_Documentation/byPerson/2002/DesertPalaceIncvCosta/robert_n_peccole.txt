mr.
robert
n.
peccole
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
at
the
very
middle
of
it,
when
we're
trying
to
settle
instructions,
the
parties
involved
agreed
to
instructions
1
through
9.
instruction
number
9
to
the
jury
was,
in
fact,
the
107(a)
instruction.
it
read...
and
this
jury
instruction
is
found
at
the
joint
appendix
32
and
33.
it
read,
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proving
each
of
the
following
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
one,
costa
suffered
adverse
work
conditions,
and
two,
costa's
gender
was
a
motivating
factor
in
any
such
work
conditions
imposed
upon
her.
gender
refers
to
the
quality
of
being
male
or
female.
if
you
find
that
each
of
these
things
has
been
proved
against
a
defendant,
your
verdict
should
be
for
the
plaintiff
and
against
the
defendant.
on
the
other
hand,
if
any
of
these
things
has
not
been
proved
against
a
defendant,
your
verdict
should
be
for
the
defendant.
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
is
the
parties
at
that
point
and
at
that
juncture
had
agreed
that
this
definitely
was
a
107(a)
case
and
it
would
go
to
the
jury
as
such.
the
only
objection
that
caesars
had
to
instructions
was
instruction
number
10,
and
instruction
number
10
was
the
same
action
defense
that
aids
caesars
in
the
fact
that
it
actually
cuts
down
the
type
of
damages
that
can
be
awarded.
in
fact,
monetary
damages
cannot
be
awarded.
that
instruction
aided
caesars
and
in
no
event
is
it
easy
for
them
to
now
come
before
this
court
and
say
they
were
harmed
by
the
fact
that
that
instruction
was
given.
i
would
point
out
that
this
is
similar
to
the
reeves
case,
and
the
reason
that
it
is
similar
is
in
reeves,
the
parties
in
that
case
had
basically
agreed
that
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework
would
be
used,
and
this
court
said
since
that
seems
to
be
the
position
of
the
parties,
we'll
accept
that.
well,
i
would
submit
that
the
same
thing
occurred
in
this
case.
the
parties
agreed
that
this
is
a
107(a)
case,
and
that's...
that's
the
way
it
was
presented
to
the
jury.
reading
703(m),
which
is
title
vii
200e-2(m)...
and
that's
found
at
the
respondent's
brief,
page
9...
the
section
specifically
states,
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
title,
an
unlawful
employment
practice
is
established
when
a
complaining
party
demonstrates
a
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin
was
a
motivating
factor
for
any
employment
practice,
even
though
other
factors
also
motivated
the
practice.
that's
stating
any
employment
practice
that...
that
takes
into
consideration
any
of
the
things
listed,
and
in
this
case,
it
was
gender.
so
it
was
a
gender-motivated
case.
i
would
point
out
that
when
we
look
at
this
statute,
it
talks
in
terms
of
a
plaintiff
having
to
demonstrate,
and
the
plaintiff
under
that
terminology
merely
had
to
show
and
bear
the
burden
of
showing
a
case
which
actually
would
indicate
that
gender
was
a
motivating
factor.
in
the
case
that
was
presented
to
the
jury,
there
was
absolutely
no
question
that
ms.
costa
showed
a
case
every
bit
as
strong
as
the
case
and
the
facts
that
were
found
in
price
waterhouse.
reference
does
not
have
to
be
made
to
price
waterhouse.
the
statute
itself
does
not
talk
in
terms
of
any
heightened
burden
placed
on
the
plaintiff,
nor
does
it
talk
in
terms
of
substantial
evidence.
it
goes
right
to
what
it
says
on
its
face
that
a
plaintiff
merely
has
to
demonstrate.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
we...
we
actually
took
the
position
that
the
language
in
703(m)
does,
in
fact,
supplant
the
language
in
701(a).
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
703(a).
excuse
me.
but--
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
--i...
i
would
like
to
maybe--
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
--i
would
like
to
backtrack
just
a
little
bit
on
that.
i
think
there's
an
explanation
necessary.
it
has
to
be
more
detailed.
in
the
price
waterhouse
case,
the
plurality
actually
had
said,
first
of
all,
the
motivating
factor
was
the...
the
motive
involved.
the
plurality
also
said
that
the...
the
words
because
of,
in
703(a),
really
didn't
mean
because
of.
it
said
something
along
the
lines
that
it
does
not
mean
solely
because
of.
that's
how
the
plurality
basically
got
to
motivating
factor.
the
language
motivating
factor
of
the
plurality
ended
up
in
703(m),
and
i
think
you
could
also
say
that
it...
the
definition
given
by
the
plurality,
to
because
of
in
703(a),
actually
came
over
into
703(m)
too.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
i
think
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
is
the
best.
the
ninth
circuit
actually
said
that
if
you
show
a
single-motive
type
case
which
falls
under
703(a),
that
it
goes
to
the
jury
as
a
because
of.
there
is
just
absolutely
no
question
that
is
the
better
approach.
the
other
approach
is,
if
there
is
a
mixed
motive...
and
these
are
decisions
that
have
to
be
made
by
the
judge
before
the
instructions
go
to
the
jury.
if
there
are
mixed
motives,
then
it
goes
to
the
jury
as
a
703(m).
in
this
case,
the
mixed
motives
were
there.
it
did
go
to
the
jury
as
a
703(m),
and
it
also
included
the
defense
that
caesars
had
available
under
706(g)(2)(b).
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
i...
i
agree
with
you
wholeheartedly
on
that.
in
fact...
and
that's
what
occurred
in
this
case.
if
you
look
at
the
verdict
form,
which
is
at
the
joint
appendix
on
page
40,
you'll
see
that
what
happened
is
the
jury
was
instructed
exactly
the
way
you
just
commented.
if
the
plaintiff
had
established
by
preponderance
of
an
evidence
that
gender
was
a
motivating
factor,
then
the
plaintiff
proved
its
case
and
should
win
right
then
and
there.
and
if
you
see,
you
will
find
in
number
2
of
the
interrogatories,
it
asks
the
question,
do
you
find
that
the
defendant's
wrongful
treatment
of
plaintiff
was
motivated
both
by
gender
and
lawful
reasons?
and
the
jury
marked
yes.
but
had
they
marked
no,
if
you
look
down
to
the
next
sentence,
it
says,
if
your
answer
was
yes,
answer
the
next
question.
if
your
answer
was
no,
proceed
to
question
number
4,
which
was
the
damage
section.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
e-2(m),
your
honor?
let
me
just--
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
--the
relationship
between
the
two
statutes?
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
okay.
first
of
all,
the
relationship,
if
we're
talking
about
703(m),
what...
what
happens
there
is
the
plaintiff--
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
--yes.
that's...
that
will
be
a
little
bit
easier.
okay.
703(m)
is
42
u.s.c.
2000e-2(m).
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
what...
what
that
new
statute
did
is
it
placed
on
the
burden
of
the
plaintiff
to
show...
and
i...
and
this...
this
burden
never
changes.
it
never
changed
with
mcdonnell
douglas.
it
does
not
change
here.
the...
the
burden
is
always
on
the
plaintiff
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
gender
was
a
motivating
factor.
so
what
happens
is
once
the
plaintiffs
have
proved
that,
he's
proved
his
case.
the
problem
now
shifts,
and
it's...
it's
an
affirmative
defense.
it's
not
a
shifting
of
burdens.
an
affirmative
defense
comes
into
play
under
42
u.s.c.
2000e-5(g)(2)(b)
which...
which
allows
the
employer
to
come
in
and
show
that
if
they
took
the
same
action,
even
though
there
was
a
gender-motivating
factor,
then
it
reduces
their
damages
or
the
possibility--
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
--my
answer
in
that
case
would
have
to
be
that
conceivably...
the
ninth
circuit
did
say
this,
that
there
are
those
cases.
the
cases
are
when
you
have
a...
a
single-motive
case.
they
got
back
into
the
distinction
between
single
and
mixed-motive.
if
you
have
a
true
single-motive
case,
then
it
would
come
under
the...
the
section
703(a)
which
is
42
2000-2(a)(1).
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
i
think
what
they
accomplished
was,
first
of
all,
they
clarified
price
waterhouse
from
the
standpoint
that
there
was
no
heightened
burden,
no
direct
evidence
burden,
no
substantial
factor
burden.
it
did
that
for
sure.
the
next
thing
that
it
did
is
it...
it
made
it
so
a
plaintiff
would
bear
the
burden
of
having
to
establish
that
gender
played
a
motivating
factor.
and
that
is
in
any
employment
decision,
not
just,
you
know,
the
very
limited
type
or
anything
like
that.
it
says,
any
employment
decision.
and
that
becomes
an
unlawful
employment
action.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
i
believe
it
does.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
i...
i
think--
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
--let
me
see
if
i
can
answer.
mcdonnell
douglas,
as
has
been
suggested...
it's
used
at
the
very
preliminary
stage
of
a...
of
a
case.
mcdonnell
douglas
at
some
point
in
that
decision
then
bursts.
it
goes
away.
and
so
what
you're
left
with
is
the
71...
or
703(a)
and
the
703(m).
now,
i'm...
here
i'm...
again
i'm
relying
on
what
the
ninth
circuit
said.
they
are
still
giving
mcdonnell
douglas
cases
some
deference,
but
what
they
are
saying
in
fact
is
yes,
once
you're
past
that
stage,
basically
the
703(m)
cases
will
come
into
play.
that
will
be
the
instructions
to
the
jury.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
no.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
to
guess,
i
would...
i
would
say
probably
a
vast
majority
of
the
cases
are.
they're...
or
not
single.
excuse
me.
those
are
mixed-motive
cases.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
no.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
yes.
and...
and
the
only
thing...
the
only
time
that
i
could
see
otherwise
would
be
a...
a
specific
instance
where,
for
example,
you
have
working
women
in
a...
in
a
department.
the
employer
comes
in
and
says
we
have
to
make
a
layoff
because
we're...
we're
in
dire
straits.
we
can't
afford
it.
they
lay
off
that
whole
division,
and
then
2
weeks
later
they
hire
a
whole
male
division.
i
think
that
you
have
the
single
motive
there
and...
and
you...
those
are
the
only
kind
of
cases
i
can
think
of.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
yes.
[laughter]
i...
i
would
entertain
any
other
further
questions.
i
think
that
one...
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
703(m)
and
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
has
approached
it,
has
made
it
simple
and
easy
for
the
judges
to
handle,
for
the
trial
attorneys
to
handle,
and
for
the
jury
to
handle
through
instructions.
it's
a...
it's
a
much
easier
way
of
handling
these
type
cases.
it...
it's
like
any
other
civil
case
basically.
plaintiff
has
to
come
in
and
show
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
it's
entitled
to
what
it's...
it's
saying
it's
entitled
to,
that
certain
things
occurred.
then
the
defense
can
either
sit
back
and
say,
well,
wait
a
second,
you
didn't
prove
your
case,
or
the
defense
can
say,
well,
maybe
there's
a
motivating
factor
here.
even
after
i
presented
valid
reasons
for
the
termination,
for
example,
then
what
they'll
do
is
they'll
say,
well,
maybe
i
want
this
instruction
that
limits
my
damages.
but
it...
it's
a
simple
structure,
and
we
have
got
to
get
to
that.
i
mean,
it
is--
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
--so
chaotic
out
there
in
the
circuits
right
now,
it's
just
unbelievable.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
i
don't
think
it
has
anything
actually
to
do
with
the
mixed-motive.
i
think
what
it
is...
they're
saying
is
even
if
that...
that
kind
of
evidence
is
present.
in
any
event,
you
succeed.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
yes.
mr.
robert
n.
peccole
i
think
if
you
read
the
any
employment
practice
means
any.
and
i
think
what
it
does
is
it
takes
away
from
that
last
sentence
or
phrase.
what
it's
done
is
it's
basically
said
any
employment
practice
where
you
can
show
that
gender,
for
example,
is
a
motivating
factor,
you've
proven
your
case.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
there's
other
factors
present,
whether
they're
legitimate
or
illegitimate.
