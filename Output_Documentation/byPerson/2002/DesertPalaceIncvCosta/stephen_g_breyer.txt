justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
so
that's
what
i
took
the
statement...
i
mean,
far
be
it
from
me
to
characterize
somebody
else's
opinion,
but
i
thought
the
statement
was
simply
saying,
and
here
this
is
an
added
feature
that
shows
how
right
the
majority
is
and
that's
true
in
that
case,
but
what
is
there
that
suggests
that
it's
not
just
an
added
feature
showing
the
majority
was
right
in
that
case,
but
that
you
have
to
have
it
and
can't
have
anything
that
isn't
direct
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
probably
am
unclear
about
it.
what
i
thought
happened
is
that
price...
that
mcdonnell
douglas
governs
a
circumstance
where
a
plaintiff
puts
on
a
case,
however
he
puts
it
on.
once
you
show
the
mcdonnell
douglas
factors,
you
can
get
to
the
jury
unless,
of
course,
the
defendant
puts
something
on.
and
once
the
defendant
puts
something
on,
mcdonnell
douglas
bursts
and
goes
away.
now,
am
i
right
about
that
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then...
then
i
don't
see
what
mcdonnell
douglas
has
to
do
with
this
because
i
would
think
90
percent
of
the
cases
in
which
there
is
a
mixed
motive
are
going
to
come
up
because
the
defendant
will
say,
i
did
it
for
a
different
reason,
and
the
plaintiff
will
come
back
and
say,
you
did
it
for
both
reasons.
so
i
think
in
90
percent
of
the
cases,
we're
not
going
to
have
any
mcdonnell
douglas
involved.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
will
just
be...
am
i
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did...
did
the
defendants
in
those
two
cases
put
on
any
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
so
do
i.
so
neither
of
those
cases
does
mcdonnell
douglas
have
to
do
with
anything,
because
they
aren't
involved
in
the
case
i
gather,
if
i'm
right,
once
the
defendant
put
on
some
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
my
question
really
is
since
mcdonnell
douglas
doesn't
have
much
to
do
with
the
cases
in
which
mixed
motive
comes
up,
why
does...
why
are
you
talking
about
mcdonnell
douglas?
what
has
mcdonnell
douglas
to
do
with
the
background
rule?
why
isn't
the
background
rule
just...
well,
what
your
opponents
are
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
explain
to
me...
and
you're
the
expert
on
this,
i'm
not.
you
try
a
lot
of
these
cases.
when
i
look
at
it,
being
naive
in
this
area,
since
i'm
not
trying
a
lot
of
them,
i
think,
well,
this...
this
seems
to
make
perfectly
good
sense.
a
plaintiff
comes
in
and
has
to
show
that
the
bad
motive
was
a
motivating
factor.
well,
once
the
plaintiff
has
shown
that,
why
shouldn't
the
plaintiff
win?
and
if,
by
the
way,
the
defendant
can
come
in
and
show
that
she
would
have
been
fired
anyway
because
she
was
a
bad
typist,
well,
then
maybe
he
shouldn't
have
to
pay
damages.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
would
you
have
that
background?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
is
it
if
you
have
two,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
in...
in
law
school,
in
my
first
year
in
torts,
i
learned
that
there's
an
odd
case
where
you
have
two
hunters
shooting
at
the
same
person.
now,
in
both
cases,
you
know,
they're
not
actually
literally
but
for
conditions,
but
they
fall
within
the
word
because.
my
torts
teacher
used
to
call
them
co-causal
conditions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i'm
amazed
that
you're
reading
because,
contrary
to
all
tort
law--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
mean
that
if
you
have
the
co-causal
condition,
which
happens
to
be
two
motives
here,
not
two
hunters,
that
it
wouldn't
fall
within
the
beginning.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
it's
a
special
case
we're
dealing
with
where
you
have
two
hunters...
i'm
sorry...
two
motives.
and
so
in
that
unusual
two-hunter/two-motive
case,
what
the
congress
did
was
write
2(m)
to
tell
you
treat
it
okay
for
liability,
but
don't
award
damages.
now,
where
am
i
wrong
in
that
analysis?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--am
i
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it...
does
it...
just
for
clarifying
in
my
mind,
does
it
matter
or
doesn't
it
matter
whether
you
say
(m)
governs
a
separate
set
of
cases?
when
i
came
in,
i
thought
the
answer
to
that
was
no,
it
doesn't,
that
e
governs
every
case
because
the
cause
can
govern
the
two-motive
cases
too,
and
that
in
(m)
congress
was
simply
clarifying
that
there
could
be
such
cases,
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
what
happens.
but
the
government
made
a
very
good
point
and
said
no,
i
shouldn't
look
at
it
that
way
and
i
should
look
at
it
as
if
e
governs
the
single-motive
case
and
then
(m)
comes
in
to
govern
the
dual-motive
case.
and
that
was
a
good
argument
too.
and
so
what
i'm
asking
you,
who
understands
this
a
little
better
than
i
do,
does
it
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
doesn't
matter.
that's
it.
