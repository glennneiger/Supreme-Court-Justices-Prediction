justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ricciardi,
would
that
demonstration
by
the
defendant
also
have
to
be
made
by
direct
evidence?
the
words
congress
used
is
the
same.
one
is
respondent
demonstrates,
and
the
other
is
the
plaintiff
demonstrates.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
question
whether
there
is,
you
would
be
suggesting
a
rule
that,
as
far
as
i
know,
is
alien
to
our
law,
that
is,
to
make
a
distinction
between
direct
evidence
and
circumstantial
evidence.
you
can
have
direct
evidence
by
a
liar
and
you
can
have
highly
convincing
circumstantial
evidence.
so
why
would
the
law
in
this
one
area
make
a
distinction
that,
as
far
as
i
know,
is
not
made
elsewhere?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
was
it...
the
it
that
was
said
in
price
waterhouse?
not
in
the...
not
in
the
plurality
opinion.
the
direct
evidence
rule
doesn't
come
out
of
a
plurality--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ricciardi,
can
we
go
back
to
the
background,
which
i
find
very
difficult
to
understand
because
if
an
elevated
proof
standard
is
wanted,
then
courts
not
uncommonly
will
say,
we
will
require
you
to
prove
something
by
more
than
a
mere
preponderance.
we
will
require
you
to
prove
this
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
then
i
can
understand.
but
a
line
between
direct
evidence
and
circumstantial
evidence...
is
there
any
other
area
where
direct
evidence
counts
for
more
than
substantial
evidence
just
by
virtue
of
being
direct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
how
do
you
get
it
out
of
price
waterhouse
when
it's
in
the
opinion,
as
justice
o'connor
said?
her
opinion.
there
were
four
people
who
didn't
say
direct
evidence.
there
was
justice
white
who
said
a
substantial
factor,
but
didn't
say
direct
evidence.
that's
a
lot
to
load
on
two
words
in
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
wouldn't
heightened
ordinarily
be
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
whether
direct
or
circumstantial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
were
those...
were
those
opinions
based
on
the
reading
of
this
court
as
depending
upon
justice
o'connor's
opinion
where
those
words
were
used?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
did
the
courts
independently
create
a
distinction
between
direct
and
substantial
evidence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
would
you
tell
me--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
would
the
court...
if
that's
what
it
was
trying
to
do,
why
would
it
resort
to
something
as
extraordinary...
now
that
we
no
longer
have
formal
rules
of
evidence,
like
you
need
two
witnesses
to
prove
a
and
three
witnesses
to
prove
b,
why
would
it
resort
to
that
kind
of
distinction
between
direct
and
circumstantial
rather
than
a
heightened
burden
expressed
as
clear
and
convincing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
as
i
understand--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
i
understand
(m),
it
isn't
a
question
of
shifting
the
burden
to
the
defendant.
the
plaintiff
wins
at
that
point.
if
the
plaintiff
demonstrates
sex
is
a
motivating
factor,
at
that
point
plaintiff
wins.
the
affirmative
defense
doesn't
take
away
the
plaintiff's
victory.
it
just
limits
the
remedy.
so
the
defendant
can't
get
off
the
hook.
as
(m)
is
structured,
it's
not
that
you're
loading
on
the
defendant
an
extraordinary
burden
of
showing
nonliability.
if
the
plaintiff
makes
the
demonstration
that
(m)
calls
for,
plaintiff
is
the
winner,
and
the
only
thing
that...
the
only
function
of
the
defense
is
to
limit
the
remedy.
that's
how
i
understand--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you...
if
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
you
were
right,
mr.
peccole,
about
(m)
taking
over
the
field
so
that
every
case
becomes
a
mixed-motive
case,
why
would
congress
have
added
not
even
if,
but
even
though
other
factors
also
motivated
the
practice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
they
said
whether
or
not,
then--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
would
see
your
point
clearly.
but
they
didn't
say
whether
or
not.
they
said
even
though,
which
seems
to
assume
that
two...
at
least
two
motivating
factors
have
been
shown:
one,
sex;
two,
another
motive...
another
even
though
another
motivating
factor
existed.
