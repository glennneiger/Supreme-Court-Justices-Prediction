mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
since
1964,
title
vii's
disparate
treatment
prohibition
has
required
a
finding
that
a
protected
characteristic
such
as
gender
was
a
but
for
cause
of
an
adverse
employment
decision.
now,
the
'91
amendments
create
a
special
rule
of
liability
for
mixed-motive
cases
where
proof
of
but
for
cause
is
not
required.
to
qualify
for--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it...
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
text
that
says,
even
though
other
factors
also
motivated
the
practice,
make
clear
that
the
amendment
only
applies
to
mixed-motive
cases.
it
doesn't
say,
even
if,
which
would
be
regardless
of
whether,
but
it
says,
even
though,
which
means
the
factors
were
present,
but
that
it
doesn't
matter.
and
so
the
text
makes
clear
that
it
applies
only
to
mixed-motive
cases,
but
it
doesn't
address--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--2(m)
says,
even
though
other
factors
also
motivated
the...
the
practice.
that's
what
2(m)
says.
and
that...
that
limits
it
to
mixed-motive
cases.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no.
if
it...
if
it
was
whether
or
not,
it
would
be
even
if.
even
though
means
the
factors
were
present.
other
factors
were
present,
but
it
doesn't
matter
under
this
statute
that
they
were.
now,
the
text
of
the
law
doesn't
address
what
kind
of
evidence
is
sufficient
to
make
out
a
mixed-motive
case,
and
it
leaves
that
to
resolution
through
background
principles
as
congress
typically
does.
congress
typically
does
not
address
what
kind
of
evidence
is
sufficient.
and
the
key
and
most
relevant
and
pertinent
background
principle
here
was
that
before
the
amendment,
direct
evidence
was
required
to
make
out
a
mixed-motive
case.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
two
sources
for
that,
justice
souter.
one
is
the
court
of
appeals'
decisions,
and
there
were
five
between
the
time
of
price
waterhouse
and
the
time
of
the
'91
amendments,
and
that
formed
an
important
part
of
the
backdrop
against
which
congress--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i...
i
would--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
think
that
those
two...
those
cases,
for
the
most
part,
were
trying
to
reconcile
this
court's
decisions
in
mcdonnell
douglas
with
price
waterhouse,
and
that's
exactly
the
first
source
for
where
we
would
get
the
background
rule
as
well.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
because
it
was
trying
to
be...
they
were
trying
to
be
faithful
to
this
court's
decisions
in
mcdonnell
douglas
and
price
waterhouse.
and
let
me
explain
how
those
two
decisions
fit
together
because
in...
in
price
waterhouse,
there
was
direct
evidence,
and
six
justices
said
that
was
sufficient
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof.
now,
no
opinion
expressly
stated
that
something
other
than
that
would
be
sufficient
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
and
five
did
not
say
that
it
would...
that
anything
less
would
be
sufficient,
however,
and
that
issue
is
resolved
by
mcdonnell
douglas
and...
and
that
line
of
cases.
and
what
mcdonnell
douglas
and
that
line
of
cases
say
is
that
in
a
purely
circumstantial
evident
case...
evidence
case...
the
plaintiff
has
a
very
light
burden
at
the
outset,
but
that
once
the
employer
comes
back
and
puts
on
a
nondiscriminatory
explanation,
the
plaintiff
has
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof
all
the
way
to
showing
pretext
and
but
for
causation.
the
plaintiff
under
the
mcdonnell
douglas
line
of
cases
has
to
show
but
for
causation.
so
when
you
put
the
two
decisions
together,
price
waterhouse
and
mcdonnell
douglas,
the
rule
that
emerges
is
in...
to
get
into
the
price
waterhouse
box,
where
you
get
a
shift
in
the
burden
of
proof,
you
need
direct
evidence.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it...
it's
a
mixed-motive
case
where
it's
not
a
but
for
factor.
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no.
if
it's...
if
it's
the
sole
motive,
then
it
would
be
a
violation
under
2000e-2(a)(1).
that
would
be
a--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no,
because
2000e-2(m)
is
designed
just
for
cases
where
there's
more
than
one
motive.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
leaves
that
to
background
principles.
and
as
i
was
saying,
that's
the
background
principle.
the
second
point
that's
very
crucial
here
is
that
if
there's
not
a
direct
evidence
requirement,
justice
stevens,
the
result
would
be
that
you
are
going
to
effectively
render
superfluous
2000e-2(1)
which
up
until
now
has
been
the
principal
safeguard
against
discrimination,
and
the
reason
is
that
2000e-2(a)(1)
requires
proof
of
but
for
cause.
2000e-2(m)
requires
proof--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--if
it's
just--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it...
certainly
it
is--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--2000e-2(a)(1)
but
not...
it
doesn't
apply
where
cases
where
it's
not
a
but
for
cause.
that's
what--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no.
that...
that's
a
special
case,
justice
breyer.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and...
and
the
ordinary
rule
is
that
you
have
to
show
that
it's
but
for
cause,
and
the
court
said
as
much
in--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the...
the
key
point
that
you're
missing
there
is
that
if
you
interpret
2000e-2(m)
in
that
way,
you
would
be
rendering
superfluous
2000e-2(a)(1)
which
requires
but
for
cause
by
virtue
of
the
because
of
language.
and
if...
if
under
the...
that's
because
in
order
to
show
a
violation,
a
plaintiff
would
only
have
to
show
motivating
factor,
not
but
for
cause.
it
would
render...
no
plaintiff
would
ever
seek
to
prove
a
2000e-2(a)
case.
they'd
always
seek
to
prove
a
2000e-2(m)
case.
and
the
result
would
be
that
what
up
until
now
has
been
the
principal
safeguard
in
literally
thousands
of
cases
under
title
vii
would
be
translated...
transformed
into
something
that
is
almost
completely
obsolete,
and
there's
just
nothing
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
so
radically
change
the
fabric
of
title
vii
law.
and
what
we
have
is
a
much
more
modest
adjustment.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
would
be
a
very
big
change
in
this
court's
law
if...
if
this
court
said
that
because
this
court
has
already
said,
under
title
vii,
the
background
understanding
is
more
likely
than
not,
and
that's
what
the
plaintiff
has
to
show.
and
so
the
way
to
look
at
this
amendment
is
not
as
a
very
fundamental
change
in
the
basic
fabric
of
title
vii
law,
but
a
response
to
a
particular
decision.
that's
what
congress
was
responding
to.
and
if
you'll
recall
in
that
case,
there
was
direct
evidence.
an
employer
basically
admitted
that
it
had
taken
gender
into
account,
and
then
the
court
said,
well,
the
employer
can
get
out
from
all
liability
by
showing
absence
of
but...
but
for
cause.
and
congress
responded
to
that
particular
decision
in
doing
that.
but
that
didn't
mean
that
congress
thereafter
went
on
to
undertake
a
complete
reexamination
of
the
law.
it
left
it
where
it
was,
and
where
it
was
is
in
purely
circumstantial
evidence
cases,
under
mcdonnell
douglas,
once
the
employer
introduces
a
nondiscriminatory
explanation,
the
plaintiff
has
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
pretext
and
but
for
cause.
if
the
court
has
nothing
further.
