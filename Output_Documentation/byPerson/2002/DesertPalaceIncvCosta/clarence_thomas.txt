justice

thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent
was
employed
by
petitioner
as
a
warehouse
worker
and
heavy
equipment
operator.
in
1996,
she
filed
this
lawsuit
asserting
a
claim
for
sex
discrimination
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
case
was
tried
before
jury
and
after
hearing
the
evidence,
the
district
court
gave
the
jury
a
mixed
motive
instruction.
the
district
court
rejected
petitioner's
argument
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
price
waterhouse
versus
hopkins,
a
mixed
motive
instruction
is
appropriate
only
when
a
plaintiff
has
presented
direct
evidence
of
discrimination.
a
ninth
circuit
panel
vacated
and
remanded
agreeing
with
petitioner
that
the
district
court
had
erred
in
giving
the
mixed
motive
instruction.
on
rehearing
en
banc
however,
the
court
of
appeals
reinstated
the
judgment
holding
that
there
is
no
heightened
evidentiary
requirement
in
mixed
motive
cases.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
congress
amended
title
vii
in
civil
rights
act
of
1991
which
provides
among
other
things
that
an
unlawful
employment
practice
is
established
"when
the
complaining
party
demonstrates
that
sex
was
a
motivating
factor
for
any
employment
practice,
even
though
other
factors
also
motivated
the
practice."
under
this
new
provision,
direct
evidence
is
not
required.
direct
evidence
of
discrimination
is
not
required
for
a
plaintiff
to
obtain
a
mixed
motive
instruction
under
title
vii.
first,
the
statute
on
this
phase
does
not
mention,
much
less
require
that
plaintiff
make
a
showing
through
direct
evidence.
title
vii's
silence
on
this
point
suggest
that
we
should
not
depart
from
our
conventional
rule
of
civil
litigation
that
a
plaintiff
must
prove
his
case
by
preponderance
of
evidence
using
direct
or
circumstantial
evidence.
second,
the
use
of
the
term
"demonstrates"
in
other
provisions
of
title
vii
tends
to
show
further
that
the
term
does
not
include
a
direct
evidence
requirement.
accordingly,
because
direct
evidence
of
discrimination
is
not
required
in
mixed
motive
cases,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
concluded
that
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
giving
a
mixed
motive
instruction
to
the
jury.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
