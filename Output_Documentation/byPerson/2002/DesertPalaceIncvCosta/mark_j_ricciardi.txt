mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
it's
ricciardi,
sir.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
extraordinary
situation
in
the
law
where
the
burden
of
proof
is
shifted
to
a
defendant.
courts
have
recognized
this
type
of
burden
shift
in
certain
limited
situations,
certain
torts,
and
in
1989
this
court
recognized
that
burden
shift
in
title
vii
cases.
we
are
here
today
because
the
court
below
has
held
and
the
respondent
argues
that
the
civil
rights
act
amendment
of
1991
shifts
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
defendant
in
virtually
all
title
vii
disparate
treatment
cases.
that
conclusion
does
not
follow
from
the
text
of
the
civil
rights
act,
nor
does
it
make
sense
based
on
this
court's
history
of
fashioning
the
orderly
presentation
of
proof
in
title
vii
cases.
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991
was
passed
in
part
as
a
response
to
certain
decisions
of
this
court.
one
of
those
decisions
was
price
waterhouse
v.
hopkins
where
the
court
recognized
that
in
certain
limited
situations
in
a
title
vii
disparate
treatment
case,
when
the
plaintiff
presents
direct
evidence
of
an
unlawful
motive
that
was
actually
relied
upon
in
making
a
decision,
the
burden
of
causation
then
shifts
to
the
defendant.
the
price
waterhouse
mixed-motive
framework
applies
to
a
narrow
subset
of
cases.
the
court
recognized
early
on
in
title
vii
that
most
of
these
cases
will
be
circumstantial
evidence
cases,
and
as
a
way
to
deal
with
that,
the
mcdonnell
douglas
case
set
up
a
framework
for
considering
the
vast
majority
of
those
cases.
in
the
few
cases
where
there
is
direct
evidence
of
illegal
animus
tied
to
an
employment
decision,
the
court
said
that
the
defendant
must
now
prove
that
it
would
have
made
the
same
decision
either
way.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
there's
two
definitions
that
we've
briefed,
your
honor.
both
of
them
i
think
are
helpful.
the
first
one
is
quoted
in
the
sg's
brief
at
page
26,
and
that's
from
the
eeoc
guidance.
and
i'll
read
that.
any
written
or
verbal
policy
or
statement
made
by
a
respondent
or
a
respondent
official
that
on
its
face
demonstrates
a
bias
against
a
protected
group
and
is
linked
to
the
complained-of
adverse
action.
we
proposed,
your
honor,
in
our
blue
brief
a
slightly
different
formulation,
but
i
believe
it
gets
you
to
the
same
place.
on
page
41
of
our
blue
brief,
borrowing
from
the
first
circuit
febres
case,
a
three-part
test
which
we
think
gets
you
to
the
same
place.
the
first
is
there
has
to
be
a
statement
by
a
decisionmaker;
second,
that
directly
reflects
the
alleged
animus;
and
third,
that
it
bears
squarely
on
the
contested
employment
decision.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
you're
correct,
your
honor.
the
words
of
the
eeoc
are
the
respondent
or
respondent
official.
yes,
so
it
does
go
a
bit
beyond.
i...
i--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--well,
i
think--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--what
could
be
contemplated
i
guess
is
a
respondent
official,
who's
maybe
even
higher
than
the
decisionmaker,
makes
the
statement.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991
sets
out
a
new
section,
and
we've
set
it
out
in
appendix
a.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
of
the
brief,
of
the
blue
brief,
your
honor.
it
sets
out
42
u.s.c.
2000e-2(m),
which
was
107(a)
of
the
civil
rights
act.
and
that
described
that
an
unlawful
employment
practice
would
be
established
when
the
complaining
party
demonstrates
that
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin
was
a
motivating
factor
for
any
employment
practice.
and
then
this
is
the
key
language:
even
though
other
factors
also
motivated
the
practice.
this
indicates
that
congress
intended
for
there
to
be
the
distinction,
recognized
in
price
waterhouse,
between
the
standard
mcdonnell
douglas
pretext
case,
which
you
prove
under
2000e-2(a),
and
the
mixed-motive
case
which
was
first
recognized
in
price
waterhouse.
the
second
part
of
the
text
that
evidences
this
distinction
is
section
107(b)
of
the
civil
rights
act
which
is
codified
there
in
that
same
place
at
2000e-5(g)(2)(b),
and
that
talks
about
where
an
individual
proves
a
violation
under
2(m)
that...
and
where
the
employer
does
not
succeed
in
proving...
excuse
me...
where
the
employer
does
succeed
in
proving
the
affirmative
defense,
then
in
that
case
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
only
to
declaratory
relief,
injunctive
relief,
and
attorneys'
fees
demonstrated
to
be
directly
attributable
only
to
the
pursuit
of
a
claim
under
section
2000e-2(m).
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
the
word
demonstrate
is
used
twice,
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
agree
that
the
respondent
or
the
defendant
or
the
employer
has
any
heightened
standard.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
in
order
to
interpret
the
burdens
of
proof,
this
court
historically
looks
at
background
principles.
and
when
we
look
at
this
statute,
using
the
court's
background
principles
of
mcdonnell
douglas
for
the
standard
pretext
case
and
price
waterhouse
for
the
standard
mixed-motive
case,
there's
no
heightened
evidentiary
standard
for
the
respondent
or
the
employer.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
your
honor,
i
believe
the
distinction
is
made
because
the
shifting
of
the
burden
to
the
defendant
in
employment
cases
is
an
unusual
thing.
it
does
not
happen
in
other
areas
of
the
law.
courts
need
a
bright
line
rule
in
order
to--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
price
waterhouse--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--well--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
what
i
believe
the--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--i...
i--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
and...
and
i
think
there
are
two
things
that...
that
we
have
to
look
at.
one
of
them
is
the
plurality
opinion
did
in...
in
note
13
state
that...
that
its
formulation
was
not
meaningfully
different
from
justice
o'connor's
concurrence.
for
what...
for
what
that's
worth,
that's
there.
and
another
way
i
think
to
look
at
the
direct
evidence
picture
is
that
six
justices
of
the
supreme
court
all
found
that
the
facts
in
price
waterhouse
were
sufficient
to
have
a
mixed-motive
burden
shift.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
well,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--i
think
we
get
that
from
going
back
to
background
principles.
the
mcdonnell
douglas
decision,
which
has
still
been
followed
and
has
been
referred
to
by
this
court,
is
the
rubric
that's
used
for
circumstantial
evidence
cases.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
plaintiff--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--i...
i--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--i...
i
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
the
reason
is
because
in...
if
you
look
at
the
facts
on
the
classic
mixed-motive
cases...
mt.
healthy,
for
example,
and...
and
that
was
a
case
specifically
relied
upon
in
justice
white's
concurrence.
there
we
had
a
school
district
in
a
written
letter
making
an
admission,
yes,
we
considered
the
illegal
aspect
of
your
first
amendment
rights.
and
then
we
have
price
waterhouse
where,
on
the
facts
it's
uncontested
that
the
written
evaluations
by
those
partners,
which
were
relied
upon
by
the
policy
board,
used
sexual
stereotypes.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
i
would...
i
would
imagine
they
absolutely
did,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
well,
because,
your
honor,
the
backgrounds
rule
enables
us
to
deal
with
the
cases
where
there
is
not
direct
evidence
of
the
illegal
motivation,
and
those
cases
will
be
rare.
and
if
you
look
at
mt.
healthy
and
if
you
look
at
the
facts...
price
waterhouse
facts,
in
the
concurrence
by
justice
o'connor
in
price
waterhouse,
it
says,
the
employer
has
created
uncertainty
as
to
causation
by
knowingly
giving
substantial
weight
to
an
impermissible
criteria.
i
believe
these
cases
will
be
few
and
far
between
where
you--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--i
have
not
uncovered
ones,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
what
the
court
in
price
waterhouse
was
faced
with,
and
i
think
it's
a
bright
line
rule
that
would
give
our
trial
judges
the
ability--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--well,
your
honor,
unfortunately
because
of
the
fractured
opinions
there,
we
have
had
to
rely
on,
besides
the
actual
words
on
the
page,
we
had
to
rely
on,
what...
the
way
the
circuits
have
read
the
case...
and
they
have
all
consistently...
almost
all
consistently
read
it
as
having
a
heightened
evidentiary
standard
and--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--your
honor,
it
might
ordinarily,
but
i
believe
in
employment
cases
it's
very
difficult
to
do.
in
employment
cases
we
have
stray
remarks,
we
have
rumors,
we
have
maybe
documents
that
are--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--your
honor,
i
think
that
you're
putting
too
much
weight
on
the
shoulders
of
the
trial
judges.
in
our
case,
our
trial
judge
was
convinced
that
there
was
direct
evidence,
and
he
was
sifting
through
what
we
believed
amounted
to
nothing
more
than
a
pile
of
circumstantial
evidence.
and
i
think
had
he
had
the
guidance
of
the
bright
line
rule,
it
would
have
been
easier
for
him.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
your
honor,
going
back
to
the
text
of
the
statute,
2(m)
defined
the
plaintiff's
duty
as
showing
that
the
illegal
criteria
was
a
motivating
factor.
but
the
vast
majority
of
cases
fall
under
2(a)(1)
where
the
plaintiff
must
show
that
he
or
she
was
discriminated
against
because
of
sex,
gender,
race,
whatever.
so
that
is
a
but
for
standard
in
2(a),
which
means
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
carry
the
ball
all
the
way
across
the
goal
line,
does
not
shift
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
defendant.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
well,
what
makes
this
extraordinary,
your
honor,
is
that
under
2(m),
the
plaintiff
never
has
to
prove
that
what
this
defendant
did
caused
this
injury.
the
but
for
is
in
2(a),
but
in
2(m),
the
plaintiff
can
say--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--your
honor,
i
believe--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--well,
your
honor,
my
response
to
that
is
i
believe
that
the
civil
rights
act
incorporated
2(m)
as
a
direct
response
and
a
partial
codification
of
the
price
waterhouse
decision
because
there
was
no
burden
shift
under
title
vii
until
price
waterhouse
created
it.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
your
honor,
i
believe
these
are
cited
in
the...
in
the
sg's
brief,
and
i
believe
there
were
five
circuit
courts
that
had,
between
price
waterhouse
and
the
civil
rights
act,
recognized
that.
your
honor,
may
i
reserve?
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
joint
appendix,
page
17,
the
middle
of
the
page.
it's
the
jury
instructions
colloquy.
the
court
says,
all
right,
may
i
hear
from
the
defense?
and
i
say,
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
no
objections
to
the
court's
instructions
1
through
9.
i
believe
this
is
not
a
mixed-motive
case,
and
under
price
waterhouse,
direct
evidence
is
required.
i
should
have
said
1
through
8.
there's
no
question
about
that.
i
don't
think
that's
fatal
to
this
appeal
for
several
reasons.
there's
no
question
that
the
trial
judge
was
on
full
notice
of
my
position
that
it
was
not
a...
it
was
not
a
price
waterhouse
case.
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
no.
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
it
was
a
mcdonnell
douglas
case.
we
should
have
gotten...
if
you
look
back
to
the
actual
jury
instruction
that
was
given,
number
7
on
page
32--
mr.
mark
j.
ricciardi
--it
was
not
a
price
waterhouse
case.
that's
why
i'm
here
today.
i've
been
living
with
this
for
many
years.
but
jury
instruction
number
7
was
the
2(a)(1)
because
of
language,
and
the
trial
judge
was
on
notice
from
our
colloquy
on
my
motion
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
which
starts
on
page
15,
that
i
was
objecting
that
the
prima
facie
case
hadn't
been
shown.
there
was
no
jury
issue
raised
to
show
pretext.
furthermore,
the
ninth
circuit,
both
the
panel
and
the
full
en
banc
court,
passed
on
the
propriety
of
the
mixed-motive
instruction
and
never
once
had
any
problem
with
the
way
i
had
preserved
the
objection.
and
then
finally,
in
this
court,
in
the...
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
we
formulated
the
question,
and
in
the
opposition,
which
i
believe
is
an
optional
filing,
the
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
raises
nothing
about
instruction
number
9
or
the
2(m)
formulation.
and
it
was
only
for
the
very
first
time
in
any
of
these
many
appeals
was
it
raised
in
the
merits
brief.
so
i
believe--
