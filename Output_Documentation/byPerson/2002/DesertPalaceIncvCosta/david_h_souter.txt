justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
but
doesn't...
doesn't
a
standard
like
clear
and
convincing
address
that
kind
of
problem?
if
all
you
have
are
stray
remarks
that,
you
know,
cannot
be
taken
as
company
policy,
et
cetera,
then
you're
going
to
have
a
hard
time
getting
to
the
clear
and
convincing
standard.
i
don't
see
why
the...
the
quality
of
evidence,
direct
or
indirect,
is...
is
necessary
to
address
that
problem
as
opposed
to
the...
to
the
quantum
of
proof,
clear
and
convincing
versus
preponderance.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
burden
of
proof
that...
that
you
keep
referring
to,
in
effect,
is
the
burden
of
proof
for
what
under
the
statutory
scheme
is...
is
a
partial
affirmative
defense.
what
is
remarkable
about
saying
if
you...
if
you
want
to
claim
a
partial
affirmative
defense,
you
have
the
burden
of
proof
on
it?
you
always
have
the
burden
of
proof
on
an
affirmative
defense.
justice
david
h.
souter
2(m)
is
addressing
something
else.
2(m)
is...
is
addressing
what
happens
if,
in
fact,
a...
a
defendant
wants
to
raise
an
affirmative
defense,
a
partial
affirmative
defense.
that's
all
it
addresses.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
isn't
all
it...
i
mean,
it
addresses
the
sufficiency
of...
of
liability,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
address
the...
the
affirmative
defense.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
say
that
because
that's
the
way
a
lot
of
court
of
appeals
determined,
or
do
you
think
that
was
a
necessity
by
virtue
of
the
split
in
the
opinions
on
this
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
only
one
stated
that
it
was
necessary
as
well
as
sufficient.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
had
five
that
did
not
say
it
was
necessary
as
well
as
sufficient.
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
this
correct,
that
mcdonnell
douglas
survives
on
your
reading
in
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
does
not
go
forward
with
anything?
the
plaintiff
puts
in
enough
to
make
a
prima
facie
case.
defendant
sits
mute.
mcdonnell
douglas
controls
the
result
there.
if
the
defendant
does
go
forward
with
something
at
that
point...
and...
and
here
i'm
not
sure
of
this,
but
i
think...
by
definition,
it
then
becomes
a
mixed-motive
case,
doesn't
it?
under
(m)?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
mcdonnell
survives
in
the
case
of
the
mute
defendant.
in
the
non-mute
defendant,
(m)
governs
everything.
