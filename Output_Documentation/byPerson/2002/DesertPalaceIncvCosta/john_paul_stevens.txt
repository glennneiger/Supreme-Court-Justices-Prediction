well,
the
text
makes
clear
that
the
exception
does,
but
why
does
2(m)
not
apply
to
all
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says
whether
or
not
they...
other
factors
motivate
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
cases
in
which
a
motivating
factor
is
not
but
for
causation
when
it's
not
a
mixed-motive
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i'm
asking
the
other...
the
converse
of
that.
if
there
was
no
second
motive,
but
merely
there's
evidence
of...
of
a
motivating
factor,
period,
isn't
that
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
also
not
be
a
violation
of
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
designed
to
create
a
special
defense
and
a
special
remedy,
but
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
what
it
takes
to
prove
the
case,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i...
i
still...
maybe
i'm
just
stupid,
but
i
don't
understand
the
difference
between
a
but
for
cause
and
a
motivating
factor
that
is
not
part
of
a
mixed-motive
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if...
if
the
only
motivating...
if
there's
a
motivating
factor
and
there's
nothing
else,
isn't
that
but
for
causation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
a
radical
change
in
our
law
if
we
said
that
instead
of
direct
evidence,
it's
clear
and
convincing
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
what...
what
did
congress
accomplish
by
703(m),
also
known
as
2000e-2(m)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
don't
suggest
the
defendant
always
admits
liability,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there's
only
issue
about
one
motive,
it's
always
that
the
defendant
has
some
kind
of
defense
in
every
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
think
it
was
a
mixed-motive
case
or
not?
