it
came
out
of
a
concurring
opinion
that
bore
my
name,
did
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
and
i
don't
think
it
appeared
in
the
plurality
opinion,
nor
in
justice
white's
concurring
opinion,
did
it?
justice

i
know
a
number
of
courts
have
followed
it,
but
i...
it's
hard
to
extract
a...
a
rule
under
those
circumstances.

congress,
in
making
its
amendments
in
1991,
did
not
mention
anything
about
direct
evidence,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
we
know
that
those
amendments
apply
only
to
mixed-motive
cases?
the
language
in
the
statute
congress
passed
is
pretty
broad.
justice
sandra

o'connor
and
in
theory,
it
could
apply
across
the
board.
