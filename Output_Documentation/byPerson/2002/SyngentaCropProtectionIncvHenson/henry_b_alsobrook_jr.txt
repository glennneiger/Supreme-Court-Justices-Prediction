mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
kikkonen
v.
guardian
life,
this
court
hypothesized
the
very
situation
that
we
have
before
you
this
morning
because
here
we
have
a
nationwide
class
action
settlement
where
the
court
specifically
by
judgment
retained
jurisdiction
to
manage
the
settlement
as
well
as
enforce
it.
a
critical
part
of
that
settlement
was
the
dismissal
of
this
case.
however,
when
class
counsel
went
to
dismiss
the
case,
as
the
eleventh
circuit
pointed
out
and
as
the
district
court
pointed
out,
his
efforts
were
thwarted
and
the
case
was
not
dismissed.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
no,
sir.
we...
we're
saying
that
under
1441
that
because
the
district
court
retained
jurisdiction,
that
that
was
original
jurisdiction
to
remove
the
matter,
and
that
actually,
your
honor,
when
we
removed
this,
they...
the
majority
of
circuit
courts
of
appeals,
namely
the
second,
sixth,
seventh,
and
eighth,
had
said
that
the
proper
vehicle
to
remove
this
was
the
all
writs
act.
and
that
is
what
we
are
claiming
today,
as
well
as
28
u.s.c.
1367
ancillary
jurisdiction,
and
we
have
set
that
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
we...
we
can...
our
reliance
on
1441
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
alabama
court
retained
original
jurisdiction
and--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
but
we...
we
construed
that
as
being
a
venue
rather
than
a...
a...
because
the
alabama
court
had
original
jurisdiction.
and
certainly
under
1651--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--the...
the
fact
that
we
had
to
take
it
to
a
federal
court
in
the
district
where
the
state
court
suit
lay,
and
then
it
was
immediately
transferred
to
the...
to
the
alabama
court.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
took...
we
took
our
road
map
from
agent
orange
product
liability.
there
they
had
a
texas--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--there,
there
was
a--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--we're
talking
about
the
second
circuit.
and--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
but,
your
honor,
also
in
that
case
was
the
case
of
ryan,
and
in
ryan,
it
was
brought
by
to
class
members
in
the
state
court
in
texas.
and
it
was
removed
to
the
federal
court
in
texas
and
then
transferred
to
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
and
that
was
our
road
map
for
getting
this
case
to...
back
to
alabama.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
yes,
and
we
also,
your
honor...
in
our
removal
petition,
we
pled
the
all
writs
act,
as
well
as
ancillary
jurisdiction
under
1367.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
we
contend
that...
that
in
order
for
the
court--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry.
yes.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
jurisprudence,
particularly
the
agent
orange
case--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--well,
i
can
cite
the
new
york
telephone
case
where
the
court
said
that...
that
removal
was...
not
removal,
but
a
writ
under
the
all
writs
act
was...
was
proper
to
avoid
the
frustration
of
judgment,
and
that
was...
that
was
certainly
the
situation
here.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
yes,
your
honor,
by
the--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--there
were
two
reasons,
justice
o'connor.
first
is
that
an
injunction
would
not
dismiss
the
case.
an
injunction
would
enjoin
the...
the
state
court
suit
from
going
forward.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
and
we
would
have
had...
our
client
would
have
had
to
carry
this
as
a
liability
on
their
books
ad
infinitum.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
yes,
they
did...
they
could,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--i
suppose
it
would
have
been.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
well,
justice
breyer,
at
the
time
that
we
did
this,
as
i
said
earlier,
there
was...
the
majority
of
federal
circuit
courts
said
that
the
proper
vehicle
was
to
remove
the
case
and
get
it
before
the
court
where...
that
had
issued
the
judgment.
today
with
the
number
of
class
action
settlements
that
are
going
on,
there
must
be
some
kind
of
way
by
which
a
federal
court
who
issues
a
judgment
can
enforce
that
judgment
across
state
lines.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
yes.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
i...
i
presume
that
the
state
court
under
those
circumstances
would
dismiss
it,
but
we
don't
know
that
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
another
reason--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
a
lot
of--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--and
not
only
that,
a
lot
of
judges.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
and
so
there
were
a
plethora
of
district
court
cases
that
allowed
the
removal
under
the
all
writs
act
and
took
jurisdiction
where
they
had
jurisdiction
originally
under
the
cases
of
naacp,
under
the
agent
orange
case,
and
the
sixth
and
seventh
circuit
cases.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
no.
the
tenth
circuit
had
ruled
that
the...
that
the
all
writs
act
could
not
be
used
in
this...
in
the
method
that
we
used
it.
we
are
not
unmindful
of
rivet
v.
regions,
but
we...
our
situation
there...
our
situation
in
this
case
is
much
different--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--we
didn't
attempt
that,
your
honor,
because
the
majority
of
the
circuits
at
the
time
approved
the
all
writs
act
as
the
vehicle
with
which
to
remove
the
case
and
to
get
it
back
before
the
district
court.
additionally,
we
felt
that
it...
state
courts
have
cases
removed
all
the
time
to
federal
court.
and
we
thought
it
would
be
less
onerous
to
the
state
court
judge
to
have
it
removed
rather
than
being
enjoined
by
a
federal
court.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
well,
the
removal
petition...
actually
the
court
loses
jurisdiction
of
it
at
that
time
because
they...
it...
it
is
removed
to...
to
the
federal
court.
and
there
again,
justice
ginsburg,
the...
we
felt
that
it
was
less
onerous
and
there
was
some
jurisprudence
or
some
dicta
and
some
legal
writing
that
indicated
that
it
would
be
less
onerous
to
the
state
court
judge
to
have
it
removed
rather
than
have
it
enjoined.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
there
again
we
had
to
rely
on
agent
orange.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
well,
we
relied
on
the
statute
because
it
says
in
the
aid
of
their
respective
jurisdiction,
and--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
and
we...
it
was
our
position
that
there...
there
respective
jurisdiction
related
to
the
alabama
court.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
we
had
to,
your
honor.
that...
under
1441,
we
had
no
alternative
but
to
remove
it.
we
couldn't
have
removed
it
from
the
louisiana
court
to
the
alabama
court
because
1441
by
venue
says
that
it
has
to
go
to
the
federal
district
court
in
the...
of
the
district
where
the
case
lies.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
that
could
be
done
under
the
anti-injunction
act,
your
honor.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
and
as...
as--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--because
14...
we
didn't
know
of
any
other
vehicle
that
would
allow
us
to
remove
it
from
louisiana
to
alabama.
even
the
all
writs
act
would
not
allow
us
to
remove
it
across
state
lines
or
even
out
of
the
district.
certainly
if
this
case
had
been
brought
in
mobile,
then
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
because
the...
the
court
in
mobile
would
have
authority
to...
to
remove
it
to
that
district.
but
it
was
brought...
brought
across
state
lines.
and
again,
we
followed
the
road
map
that
had
been
set
out
for
us
in
agent
orange.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
feel
that...
that
under...
under
the
hypothet
set
out
in
kikkonen
that
the
alabama
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
take
that
case.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
this
could
be
a...
well,
there
is
no
writ
for
this,
judge...
justice.
there
isn't
any
writ
for
this.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
because
in
other
cases,
the
all
writs
act
has
been
used
to...
to
remove
cases
to
avoid
a
state
court
case
from
thwarting
a
federal
judgment.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
well,
i
think
justice
kennedy
brought
that
up
and--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
well--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--if
we're
right
on
the
merits,
your
honor,
what
i
suggest
you
should
do
is
reverse
the
eleventh
circuit.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
i
would...
the
alternative
i
would
suggest
is
to
remand
the
matter
to
the
federal
district
court
in
mobile
with
instructions
for
them
to
file
an
injunction
or
a
contempt
proceeding
against
the
party--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--no.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
your
honor,
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
i
was
that
counsel,
and
i
had
talked
with
the
class
counsel
days
before,
and
he
assured
me
that
he
would
take
care
of
it
and
there
would
be
no
problem.
we
didn't
anticipate
this
happening
because
the
language
of
the
stipulation
of
settlement,
which
the
respondent
signed,
was
so
specific
that
we
couldn't
imagine
that
the
state
court
judge
would
not
dismiss
it
on
the
motion
of
class
counsel.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
he
actually
told
us
we
didn't
have
to
appear,
that
he
would
take
care
of
it.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
the--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--well--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--justice
scalia--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
and--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--and
also
because
the
majority
of
the
circuits
have
approved
the
procedures
that
we
followed
in
this
case.
you
have
the
second
circuit;
you
have
the
sixth,
seventh,
and
eighth.
and--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--the
reasoning
of
those
circuits
were
that
they
had
retained
jurisdiction
to
enforce
their
judgments.
for
example,
if
you
take
naacp
ii...
rather,
naacp
i,
the
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
circuit
court.
naacp
ii,
the
court
said
that
because
they
had
retained
jurisdiction
in
an
order,
that
they
could
go
forward
under
the
all
writs
act.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
well--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--well,
we
had
to
rely
on
what
the
courts
were
telling
us,
your
honor...
i
mean,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
the
agent
orange
case,
there
were
two
different
districts,
yes.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
no.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
excuse
me.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
justice
breyer
was
correct
when
he
pointed
out
that
the
stipulation
that
was
entered
into
is
really
not
ambiguous.
the
eleventh--
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
--all
right.
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
at
the
time
that
we
removed
this
also
we
relied
on
naacp
ii,
and
there
the
court
said
that
if
there
are
two
alternatives
that...
and
they
also
pointed
out
a
footnote
3
in
the
kikkonen
case
which
said
that
an
injunction
could
be
issued
where
there
are
two
alternatives
that...
that
you
can
choose
between
one
or
the
other,
and
that
the...
the--
anti-injunction
act
does
not
preclude
the
remedy
under
the
all
writs
act.
so
we
realize
that
the
court
is
not
a
legislative
body
and
that
it
has
been
brought
out
here
that
congress
is
the
one
that
can...
can
dictate
the
jurisdictional
bounds
of
federal
courts.
but
by
the
same
token,
your
honor,
we
have
a
great
number
of
class
action
settlements
that
are
pending
in
this
country
that
have
been
already
consummated
in
this
country,
and
we
face
a
situation
where
the
settling
party
who
has
settled
a
national
class
action
must
have
some
kind
of
remedy
to
stop
suits
in
state
courts
that
attempt
to
thwart
that
class
action
settlement.
and
so
we
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
that
in
its...
in
its
deliberations.
if
there
any
further
questions?
mr.
henry
b.
alsobrook,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
