do
you
agree
that
the
all
writs
act
is
not
a
source
of
original
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why...
why
then
didn't
you
try
to
get
an
injunction
in
the
district
court
in
alabama?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
that
isn't
before
us
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
several
circuits
have
allowed
the
all
writs
act
to
be
used
in
this
fashion,
do
you
think?
