justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
looking
at
the
language
of
the
all
writs
act,
which
authorizes
all
courts
established
by
act
of
congress
to
issue
writs
necessary
or
appropriate
in
aid
of
their
respective
jurisdictions
and
so
forth.
now,
in
this
case,
you
removed
from
the
federal...
to
the
federal
court
in
louisiana
in
order
to
protect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
in
alabama.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
square
that
with
the
language,
respective
jurisdictions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
rely
on
the
statute,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
think
that
refers
to
the
court
to
which
removal
would
take...
would
occur?
and
here
it's
the
louisiana
federal
court,
not
the
alabama
federal
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
you
removed
to
the
louisiana
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
those
cases
in
which
there
were
two...
two
different
districts
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
all
of
them
were
not,
were
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
weren't
some
of
them...
yes.
it
seems
to
me
it's
quite
different
if
you're
remanding
to
the
court
where
the
problem
arose
than
remanding
to
a
different
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
or
removing,
rather.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
about
contempt?
i
suppose
you
could
have
been...
your
client
could
have
been
held
in
contempt
in
that
court,
couldn't
it?
i
mean,
assuming
you're
wrong...
that
he's
right--
