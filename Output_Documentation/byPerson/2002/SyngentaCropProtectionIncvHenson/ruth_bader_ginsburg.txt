justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
have
no
right
to
remove
under
1441
because
there
wasn't
complete
diversity
in
the
louisiana
suit.
isn't
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
can't
rely
on
1441
and
that's
conceded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not...
nothing
in
41
rests
on
that.
it
has
to
be
a
case
that
would
qualify
for
original
jurisdiction,
and
you
don't
have
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
initially
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
judge
weinstein's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--order,
which
was
in
no
way
based
on
1441.
it
was
based
on
1651.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
all
done
under
the
all
writs
act
or
what
they
thought
was
the
authority
granted
by
1651.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
were
there
any
cases
under
the
relitigation
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act
that
used
that
device,
the
antisuit
injunction,
to
accomplish
the
same
thing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was...
that
was
a
question
of
fighting
it
out
in
the
state
court,
and
it's
not
the
antisuit
injunction
that
we're
discussing
now.
rivet
said
it's
an...
preclusion
is
an
affirmative
defense.
you
can
raise
it
in
the
state
court
that
prior
federal
litigation
precludes
this
case.
the
other
way
to
go
is
to
ask
the
court
that
entered
the
judgment,
the
class
action
judgment,
the
nationwide
class
action,
to
enjoin
the
party
who
was
supposed
to
have
settled
the
claim
from
proceeding
in
the...
in
the
original
case
when
part
of
the
bargain
was
to
dismiss
it.
so
i...
i'm
just
curious
why
you
didn't
attempt
that
route.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
that
because
right...
built
right
into
the
removal
provision
is
a
command
that
the
state
court
shall
proceed
no
further.
so
the
removal
petition
acts
as...
as
a...
an
injunction
against
the
state
court
proceeding
further.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
1441
wasn't
available
to
you.
so
as
long
as
something
new
is
being
created
in...
under
1651,
why
not
say
that...
that
the
court
that
has
jurisdiction
over
the
class
action
can
issue
orders
to
stop
inconsistent
litigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do...
as
far
as...
you're
creating
a
removal
that
doesn't
exist
by
statute.
so
not...
why
not
go
all
the
way
and
say,
under
the
all
writs
act,
we
can
remove
to
the...
from
the
louisiana
state
court
to
the
alabama
court?
why
touch
base
with
1441
when
1441
is
inapplicable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
still
have
problems
even
if
it
were
to
the
middle
district
of
alabama,
because
you
don't
have
complete
diversity
in
the
louisiana
action.
therefore,
1441
doesn't
apply.
you
would
still
have
to
use
your
all
writs
act
theory
even
if
the
case
were
pending...
if
the
federal
and
state
court
were
in
the
same
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
would
be
up
to
you
to...
i
mean,
the
court
doesn't
initiate
an
injunction.
you'd
have
to
ask
for
it.
and
i
assume
you
would
be
free
to
do
it.
if
all
this
court
would
decide,
if
it
decided
against
you,
was
that
the
all
writs
act
is
not
available
for
this
purpose,
that
would
leave
you
as
though
you
had
never
pursued
that
route
and
you
could
pursue
another.
there's
something
curious
about
this
case,
and
maybe
you
can...
you
can
help
me
understand
it.
when
the
plaintiff's
class
counsel
in
price
went
into
the
louisiana
court
and
said,
louisiana
court,
drop
that
case,
dismiss
that
case,
the
defense
counsel
wasn't
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
were
relying
on
plaintiff's
counsel--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
do...
to
do
that
job
for
you
and
felt
you
didn't
need
to
appear
in
the
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
yonkers
case,
the
united
states
government
urged
the
court
to
take
that
position,
didn't
it?
so
it
wasn't
something
newfangled
that
the
court
dreamed
up
on
its
own
when
it
was
the
department
of
justice
urging
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
you
would
defend
against
injunctive
relief
on
the
ground
that
the
settlement
was
narrower
than--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
why
didn't
you
seek
that
construction
from
the
court
that
issued...
that...
that
entered
the
settlement?
why
go
to
another
federal
court?
louisiana
doesn't
know
anything
about
this
case...
instead
of
saying,
alabama
federal
district
judge,
please
clarify
the
scope
of
the
settlement
so
that
we
can
either
go
on
with
our
case
or
know
that
we
can't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
be
wrong
with
the
eleventh
circuit
saying
in
substance
it's
the
same
thing?
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
stop
this
litigation
from
going
forward
in
louisiana.
so
even
though
the
defendants
used
the
wrong
device,
we'll
treat
it
as
though
it
had
been
in
application
for
an
antisuit
injunction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
number
of
courts
that
have
allowed
the
1651
all
writs
removal
have
said
that
they
thought
that
that
was
less
offensive.
that
was
more
faithful
to
the
federalism
concern,
that...
that
issuing
an
antisuit
injunction
was
more
offensive
to
the
state
than
this
removal
device.
