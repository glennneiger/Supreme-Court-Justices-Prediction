stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
that's
so,
then
why
don't...
why
are
we
trying
to
read
into
1441
language
that
isn't
there
and
read
requirements
out
of
1651,
requirements
that
are
there,
when
there
was
another
way,
totally
consistent
with
the
words,
the
statute,
everything
else,
that
you
could
have
achieved
any
legitimate
objective
that
you
had?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is.
isn't
that
just
in
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
and
justice
kennedy?
you
provided
the
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
certiorari
i
guess
is
the
closest.
historically
you
could
have
sent
certiorari...
a
court
to
any
other
court
and
to
any
administrative
agency.
i
guess
that
would
be
the
closest
historically.
would
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
as
we've
come
to
limit
it,
it's...
it's
higher
to
lower,
but
if
you
go
back
into
history,
it
wasn't,
i
don't
think.
i
mean,
has
it
come
down
to
saying,
look,
you
were
in
a
situation
where
you
thought
that
the
signer
of
the
stipulation
was
flat
out
violating
it,
and
you
didn't
know
what
to
do,
so
you
read
the
precedent,
and
there
was
precedent
that
suggested,
under
the
lower
court
precedent,
that
this
was
the
right
thing
to
do.
so
you
did
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
if
you
turn
out
to
be
wrong,
what
should
we
do
next,
assuming
you're
right
about
the
stipulation?
they
just
flat-out
wouldn't
follow
it.
and...
and
suppose
you
were
wrong
about
the
route.
have
you
any
suggestion
for
us
as
to
what
to
do?
do
we...
i
guess
we'd
have
to
dismiss...
order
this
case
dismissed
without
prejudice
to
your
going
to
the
alabama
court
and...
and
asking
them
to
enjoin?
or
what
is
your
suggestion
about
what
we
should
do--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
you're
right
on
the
merits
of
this
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
mean
the
merits
of
the
procedural
issue.
suppose
that
you're
wrong
about
that,
hypothetically,
but
you're
right
about
your
basic
instinct,
that
they
signed
a
piece
of
paper
saying,
we
promise
to
dismiss
this
case
in
the
state
court
and
then
they
didn't.
they
just
didn't
do
it.
that
was
your
view
of
this.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
have
you
any
suggestion
for
us
about
how
we
might
help
you
achieve
that
ultimate
objective,
and
by
us,
i
don't
mean
this
court
particularly.
i
mean
the
law.
the
law
should
provide
a
way
that
you
get
that
objective
if
you're
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
can
say
in
a
sentence...
as
i
read
this,
it
says,
class
counsel
hereby
stipulates
that
the
related
case,
including
any
and
all
claims,
will
be
dismissed.
and
then
it
defines
related
case
to
refer
to
hurley
henson
by
number
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i'm
just
curious
what
the
defense
would
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
administrative
agencies.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sewer
commissioners,
i
think
is--
