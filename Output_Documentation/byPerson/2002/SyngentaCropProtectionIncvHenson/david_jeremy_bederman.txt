mr.
david
j.
bederman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
all
writs
act
may
not
be
relied
upon
to
remove
an
otherwise
unremovable
case.
it
is
congress's
province
to
define
the
limits
of
removal,
and
chief
of
these
is
the
requirement
of
original
jurisdiction
in
federal
court.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
very
likely
mr.
alsobrook
will
apply,
as
the
eleventh
circuit
invited
them
to,
for
an
injunction.
such
an
injunction
could
proceed
because
under
this
court's
decision
in
parsons
steel,
the
state
court
has
yet
to
issue
a
conclusive
ruling
about
preclusive
effect.
and
therefore,
they're
at
liberty
to.
we
are,
by
no
means,
conceding
the...
the
substantive
merits
of
the
injunction
motion
whether
they
would
have
a
substantial
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits,
but
we
would
certainly
agree
that
they
have
the
ability
to
file
an
injunction
immediately.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
the
issue
on
the
merits
would
be
presumably
the
proper
construction
of
the
settlement
agreement--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--that's
right.
and,
of
course,
whether
an
injunction,
narrowly
tailored
to
the
parties,
would,
as...
as
the
justices
have
already
indicated,
be
properly
addressed
to
the
parties
to
order
dismissal
of
the
case.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
we
would
contest
the
merits
of
the
injunction.
we
would
not
context
the
ability
of
them
to
file
for
the--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--that's
right,
justice
breyer.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
the
only
defense
that...
that
i
could
imagine
is
the
ambiguity
in
that
provision,
as
you
were
reading,
at
38a
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
the
concern
about
whether
including
any
and
all
claims,
including
without
any
limitation
any
claims
defined
herein.
and
what
has
not
been
made
clear
is
that
there
were
subsequent
amendments
to
the
stipulation,
which
made
clear
that
certain
classes
of
claims
were
excluded.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
certainly
not,
justice
o'connor.
what's
before
this
court
is
what
is
the
proper
procedural
mechanism
to
be
used
here.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
in
this
fashion?
yes,
justice
o'connor.
that
clearly
this
is
what
i
would
characterize
as
a
newfangled
procedural
device
that
was
launched
by
the
second
circuit
after
the
yonkers
and
agent
orange
cases;
that
it
has
developed,
as
i
think
mr.
alsobrook
fairly
characterizes,
a
momentum
of
its
own
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
that
is
true,
but
my
recollection
of...
of
the
procedural
background
with
the
yonkers
case
was
that
there
was
some
concern
about
how
judge
sand
drafted
the
consent
decree
in
that
case.
he...
as
was
later
acknowledged,
judge
sand
had
been
perhaps
misled
by
certain
representations
made
by
the
archdiocese
of
new
york
and
therefore
he
did
not
include
a
provision
that
would
allow
for
a
subsequent
injunction
or...
or
a
retention
of
jurisdiction.
that
may
have
led
the
court
in
that
circumstance
to
invoke
all
writs
act.
but
there,
again,
the
complete
alternative
was
an
injunction
that
could
have
issued
in
these
new
york
land
use
proceedings
that
were
pending
in
state
court.
so
even
in
yonkers,
which
presents,
i
think,
analytically
a
very
different
context
here,
not
a
preclusion
case,
not
a
case
that
turns
on
the
construction
of
an
earlier
federal
court
judgment
or
settlement,
there
was
the
availability
of
injunctive
relief.
in
that
case,
the
second
circuit
bypassed
that...
that
reasoning
and
went
straight
towards
an
all
writs
act
basis--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--we
would
defend
essentially
on
the
merits,
is
that
an
injunction
should
not
issue
because
our
construction
of...
of
the
settlement
is--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--we
believe
that
the
proper
course
is...
in
view
of
the
precise
enumeration
of
the...
of
the
case
in
state
court,
that
the
proper
course
was
to
amend
the
petition
and
seek
a
resolution.
mr.
henson
and
his
counsel
could
have
very
well
initiated
an
entirely
new
case
and
evaded
the
terms
of...
of
the
settlement
in
that
fashion.
they
agreed
and
decided
that
the
proper
course,
the
more
forthright
course
was
to
seek
leave
to
amend
the
petition
to
make
clear
that
certain
claims
were
dropped
by
virtue
of
the
earlier
settlement,
but
there
were
remaining
claims
in
play.
and
it
was
believed
that
this
was
the
most
forthright
approach
to...
to
use
here.
i
would
credit,
justice
ginsburg,
that
it
may
have
been
equally
appropriate
to
go
back
to
the
federal
court,
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
or
some
kind
of
decision
in
that
fashion.
but
i
believe
that
this
course
was
certainly
honest
and
forthright
on
the
part
of
counsel
below.
i...
i
hardly
think
it
may
be
necessary
to
indicate
that
the
all
writs
act
does
not
confer
jurisdiction
under
1441,
as
was
already
made
clear
in
certainly
the
questioning
and
certainly
in
view
of
petitioners'
discussion.
original
jurisdiction
has
always
been
required
and
has
been
upheld
in
countless
cases.
and
moreover,
the
all
writs
act
textually
demands
that
federal
courts
issue
writs,
quote,
"in
aid
of
their
respective
jurisdiction.
"
petitioners'
argument
essentially
would
read
out
1651.
clearly
the
all
writs
act
does
not
independently
grant
original
jurisdiction,
and
this
has
been
consistently
upheld
by
this
court
for
nearly
200
years
from
the
mcintire
decision
in
1813
to
as
recently
as
clinton
v.
goldsmith
in
1999.
moreover,
issuance
of
writs
under
the
all
writs
act
is
certainly
conditioned
by
the
statutory
requirement
that
such
be
necessary
or
appropriate.
and
as
this
court
indicated
in
pennsylvania
bureau
of
corrections,
this
is
essentially
a
threshold
requirement
for
invocation
of
the
all
writs
act.
and
in
the
goldsmith
case,
as
recently
as
3
or
4
years
ago,
this
court
made
clear
that
the
all
writs
act
can't
be
used
as
a
form
of
cure-all
to...
to
fix
what
would
otherwise
be
the
availability
of
other
statutory
mechanisms
which
are
not
otherwise
complied
with.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
well,
if...
if,
of
course,
the
eleventh
circuit
had
construed
petitioners'
filings
in
that
way
and...
and
had
indicated
that
injunction
was
the
proper
mode
and
essentially
substituted,
as
they...
as
they
seem
to
invite
in
their
closing
lines
of
their
decision,
i
think
that
would
be
appropriate.
but
there
is
certainly
a
difference
in
form
and
in
content
between
a
removal
and
a
narrowly
tailored
injunction,
and
i
think
the
eleventh
circuit
was
correct.
and
other
courts
of
appeals
that
have
so
held
have
indicated
that
there
are
profound
federalism
concerns
that
are
implicated
in
allowing
essentially
a
common
law
writ
of
removal
to
be
used
to
evade
what
is
congress's
role
in
dictating
the
mechanism
for
removal
and...
and
patrolling
the
boundary
and
the
balance
of
authority
between
state
courts
and
federal
courts
in
this
country.
there
is,
as...
as
the
court
indicated,
no
such
thing
as
a...
as
a
common
law
writ
of
removal.
there
was
no
analogy
in
english
common
law
at
the
time
of
the
founding.
the...
a
writ
of
certiorari,
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
would
have
been...
could
have
been
potentially
directed,
i
would
agree,
to...
to
courts.
but
in
no
circumstance
was
there
analogy
in
english
common
law
for
the
court
of
one
sovereign
to
remove
cases
from...
from
another
sovereign.
and
unless
we
delve
into
a
kind
of
obscurantist
legal
history,
i
think
that
would
be
clear.
but
there
was,
in
fact,
no
analogy
for
that.
and
in
truth,
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
writ
of
removal--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--i
presume
that
in
english
common
law,
to
the
extent
that
administrative
agencies
existed,
the
ones
i'm
aware
of,
of
course,
were
quite
inchoate.
it's
potential
that
you--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--that's
right.
or...
or
sanitary
commissions
in
london.
one
might
imagine
that.
but
again,
at
issue
here
is...
is
removal,
which
this
court
has
always
indicated
is
a
creature
of
statute
because
of
the
profound
federalism
concerns.
and
essentially
what...
what
petitioners
would
have
this
court
do
is
allow,
by
use
of
the
all
writs
act
or
analogous
theories
of
ancillary
enforcement
jurisdiction,
to
achieve
what
is
otherwise
unavailable
by
statute.
and
as
this
court
clearly
said
in
the
pennsylvania
bureau
of
corrections
case,
although
the
all
writs
act
empowers
federal
courts
to
fashion
extraordinary
remedies
when
the
need
arises,
it
does
not
authorize
them
to
issue
ad
hoc
writs
whenever
compliance
with
statutory
procedures
appears
inconvenient
or
less
appropriate.
if
i
can
say
just
a
word
or
two
about
ancillary
enforcement
jurisdiction,
to
the
extent
to
which
petitioners
appear
to
be
relying
on
it.
this
court
has
said
very
clearly
in
both
kikkonen,
where
the
court
indicated
that
ancillary
enforcement
jurisdiction
may
be
used
in
view
of
what
courts
require
to
perform
their
functions,
and
in
peacock,
where
the
court
made
very
clear
that
ancillary
enforcement
jurisdiction
is
a
creature
of
necessity,
there
can
be
no
showing
of
necessity
here
by
virtue
of
the
availability
of
alternate
mechanisms,
whether
in
the
form
of
an
injunction
properly
issued
against
the
parties
and
consistent
with
the
relitigation
exception
under
the
anti-injunction
act,
or
even,
preferably,
recourse
to
state
courts
to
properly
rule
on
the
preclusive
effect
of
earlier
federal
court
judgments
and
settlements,
as
this
court
made
clear.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
in
the...
in
the
federal
court.
and
of
course,
obviously
sanctions
were
imposed
below
by
the
federal
district
court,
and
that's,
of
course,
not...
no
longer
at
issue
before
this
court,
but
that
court
has
that
power.
so
certainly
there
are
a
variety
of
mechanisms
to
ensure
compliance
with...
with
court
orders.
it
is
not
respondent's
submission
to
suggest
that
we
take
an
important
tool
out
of
the
toolbox
of
federal
courts
in
order
to
maintain
the
dignity
and
the
enforcement
of
their
judgments.
but--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that
characterization.
the
assumption
seems
to
be
that
the
injunction
would
somehow
issue
to
the
state
court,
and
as
of
course
we
all
know,
that
would
never
be
the
case.
that
truly
would
be
offensive.
the...
the
injunction
would
issue
to
the
parties,
however,
with
instructions
to...
to
dismiss
or
an
even
maybe
even
more
narrowly
tailored
instrument.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
absolutely.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
absolutely.
it
is...
if
congress
wishes
to
address
the
availability
of
removal
in
this
class
action
context...
and
there
is
pending
legislation
today
to
that
effect...
congress
is
free
to
do
so.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
i
wouldn't
speak
to
the
propensity
of
congress
in
those
circumstances,
but
they
could
also
amend
the
anti-injunction
act
to
also
change
the
balance
of
power
between
state
courts
and
federal
courts.
we
take
no
issue
with
that.
your
honors,
unless
there
are
any
further
questions.
