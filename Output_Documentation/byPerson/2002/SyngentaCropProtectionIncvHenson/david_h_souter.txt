justice
david
h.
souter
the...
the
only
loose
end,
it
seems
to
me,
that...
that
you
have
left,
after
your
answers
to
justices
o'connor
and
kennedy,
is
the
problem
you
say
your
client
would
have
in
carrying
liability
on
the
books
until
the
second
action
was
somehow
finally
terminated.
but
isn't
the
answer
to
that
that
once
you
had
gotten
either
the
injunction
or
simply
the...
the
order
to
the
parties
under
the
retained
jurisdiction,
you
then
could
have
gone
into
court
in
the
second
suit
and
said,
they
cannot
prosecute
the
suit?
it
has
been
enjoined.
therefore,
please
dismiss
it.
wouldn't
you
have
gotten
your
dismissal
and
wouldn't
that
have
taken
the...
the
liability
off
the
book?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
i
guess
why
wouldn't
that
have
been
the
appropriate
course?
