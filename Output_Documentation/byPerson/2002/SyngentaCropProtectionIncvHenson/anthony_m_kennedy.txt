well,
couldn't
the
injunction
have
ordered
the
party
to
dismiss
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
why...
why
wouldn't
that
be
sufficient?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
was
thinking
about
different
writs,
and
you've
researched
this
more
thoroughly
than
i,
i
suspect.
i
thought
the
closest
thing
here
was
a
writ
of
certiorari.
this
is
like
a
writ
of
certiorari,
but
a
writ
of
certiorari
is
from
a
superior
court
to
an
inferior
court.
and
i...
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
we
treat
state
courts
and
federal
courts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and...
which...
and
so
that
the
absence
of
that
kind
of...
of
writ
indicates
to
me
that
the
safer
course,
the
more
prudent
course
is
to
rely
on
the
standard
equitable
remedies
such
as
injunction
that
we've
been
discussing.
