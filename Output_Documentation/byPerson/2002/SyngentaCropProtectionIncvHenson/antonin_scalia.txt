except
that
a
lot
of
other
lawyers
had...
had
relied
on
the
course
that
you
relied
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
were
following
what
had
been
a
successful
course
in
the
past.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
to
be
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
alsobrook,
what
is...
what
is
this
writ
called?
i
mean,
lyndon
johnson
is...
is
once
supposed
to
have
asked
somebody
in
the
justice
department
to
get
him
a
writ
of
fixitatis.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
is
this
writ
called?
a
writ
of
removal?
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
well,
then
how
can
you
do
it
under
the
all
writs
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
alsobrook,
if
we
disagree
with
you
and
reverse
the...
and
affirm
the
eleventh
circuit,
we
would
be
affirming
a
decision
that
says
in
its
conclusion,
we
accordingly
vacate
the
district
court's
order
dismissing
henson
and
remand
with
instructions
for
the
court
to
remand
henson
to
louisiana
state
court.
we
do
not,
however...
this
is
part
of
what
it
said...
we
do
not,
however,
imply
that
the
district
court
may
not
by
injunction
force
henson's
dismissal.
so,
you
know,
we
wouldn't
have
to
say
that...
that
our
decision
here
was
without
prejudice.
the
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit
was
said
to
be
without
prejudice.
so
you...
you'd
be
able
to,
as
far
as
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion
is
concerned,
get...
get
the
injunction.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wonder
why
it
wasn't...
wasn't
more
efficient
for
you
to
seek
the
injunction
instead
of
coming
up
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess...
i
guess--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
answer
is
better
to
have
two
bites
at
the
apple
than
one.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
you
lose
here,
you
can
then
seek
the
injunction.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bederman,
i
just
asked
your...
your
friend
to...
to
explain
why
he
was
up
here.
why
are
you
up
here?
because
even
if
you
win,
the
case
will...
you
know,
don't
you
think
that
an
injunction
will
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why...
okay.
what...
what
is
at
issue
on
the
merits?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
settlement
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
you...
you
would...
you
would
contest
the
injunction
just
as
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
if
congress
wants
to
be
more
offensive,
it
presumably
can.
