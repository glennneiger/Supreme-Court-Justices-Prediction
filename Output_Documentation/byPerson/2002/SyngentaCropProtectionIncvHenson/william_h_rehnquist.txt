syngenta
crop
protection,
inc.
v.
hurley
henson.
mr.
alsobrook.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
alsobrook,
i
see
you've
changed
the
question
presented
from
the
time
in
your
certiorari
petition
to
your
opening
brief.
and
the
question
presented,
when
we
granted,
referred
to
28
u.s.c.,
section
1441,
and
now
you
have
dropped
your
reference
to
that.
does
that
mean
you're
abandoning
reliance
on
1441
or
simply
broadening
the
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
you
construe
as
being
venue?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you...
you
can't
remove
a
case
to
a
federal
court
outside
of
the
district
in
which
the
state
court
sat,
is
my
understanding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
is
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
court
are
you
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
your
theory
under
the
all
writs
act?
is
your
theory
that
removal
is
itself...
comes
under
the
all
writs
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can't
you
answer
the
question
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
the
all
writs
act
required
the
existence
of
some
sort
of
a
common
law
writ
like
certiorari
or
prohibition
or
injunction
or
something
like
that.
there...
there
never
was
a
common
law
writ
of
removal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
can
you
cite
any
of
our
cases
that
support
you
in
this
respect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
that
was
a
different...
that
was
an
existing
writ.
here...
here
you're
saying,
in
effect,
that
removal
is...
is
itself
a
writ.
and
i
simply
don't
see
how
the
cases
support
you
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
was
the
reasoning
of
those
circuits?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what...
did
they
specify
what
kind
of
a
writ
it
was
they
were
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
should
think
that
might
have
made
you
a
little
hesitant
to
rely.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
a
good
defense
to
a
malpractice
action.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
wish
to
save
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--remainder
of
your
time
for
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
mr.
bederman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it's
not
before
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
may
be
that
a
particular
remedy
in
a
particular
situation
might
be
less
offensive
to
federalism,
but
that's
a
concern
that
should
be
addressed
by
congress,
isn't
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
view
of
this
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bederman.
mr.
alsobrook,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not...
i
don't
think
that's
before
us,
mr.
alsobrook.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
i
don't
think
whether
or
not
you
might
be
entitled
to
an
injunction,
should
you
seek
one,
is...
is
presented
by
the...
your
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
alsobrook.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
01-757,
syngenta
crop
protection
versus
henson.
in
this
case,
respondent,
henson
filed
a
tort
suit
against
the
petitioner,
syngenta
crop
protection
in
state
court
in
louisiana.
the
state
court
judge
stayed
his
suit
when
henson
intervened
in
a
similar
suit
against
syngenta
in
federal
court
in
alabama
and
participated
in
a
nationwide
settlement.
the
settlement
appeared
to
provide
that
henson
would
dismiss
his
louisiana
suit
but
when
he
returned
to
louisiana,
he
told
the
state
court
judge
that
the
settlement
did
not
require
dismissal
and
the
judge
allowed
the
suit
to
proceed.
so,
syngenta
promptly
sought
to
remove
henson's
louisiana
suit
from
state
to
federal
court
relying
on
the
general
removal
statute,
28
u.s.c.
1441.
section
1441
authorizes
the
removal
of
actions
over
which
the
federal
courts
have
original
jurisdiction.
syngenta
claimed
there
was
original
jurisdiction
based
on
the
all
writs
act
and
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute.
the
federal
court
transferred
the
case
to
the
same
alabama
court
that
had
entered
the
earlier
settlement
and
the
alabama
district
court
dismissed
henson's
suit
as
barred
by
the
settlement.
henson
appealed
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
reverse
concluding
that
the
action
was
not
properly
removed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
this
decision.
the
all
writs
act
authorizes
courts
to
issue
all
writs
necessary
or
appropriate
in
aid
of
their
respective
jurisdiction.
this
is
a
fairly
broad
statement
but
as
we
explained
in
pennsylvania
bureau
of
corrections,
where
another
statute
specifically
addresses
the
particular
issue
at
hand,
it
is
that
authority
and
not
the
all
writs
act
that
controls.
removal
of
a
lawsuit
from
state
to
federal
court
is
permitted
only
where
authorized
by
statute.
here,
henson
relied
on
the
general
removal
statute
section
1441.
but
that
statute
permits
removal
only
of
actions
over
which
the
federal
courts
have
original
jurisdiction.
henson
claimed
original
jurisdiction
first
based
on
the
all
writs
act
but
as
we
explained
in
clinton
versus
goldsmith,
all
that
does
is
authorize
writs
in
aid
of
a
court's
jurisdiction;
it
does
not
grant
federal
courts
any
jurisdiction
in
its
own
rigth.
henson
also
relied
on
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
jurisdiction,
but
that
doctrine
allows
a
court
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
claims
that
are
ancillary
to
claims
over
which
it
already
has
jurisdiction.
ancillary
jurisdiction,
whether
alone
or
in
combination
with
the
all
writs
act,
cannot
help
henson
satisfy
the
statutory
requirements
for
removal.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
