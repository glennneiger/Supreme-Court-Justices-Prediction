mr....
mr.
kolbo,
as
a
preliminary
matter,
would
you
address
the
question
of
whether
the
named
plaintiff
patrick
hamacher
has
standing
in
this
case.
he
was
denied
admission,
i
think,
in
1997?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
he
claimed
that
he
intended
to
apply
to
transfer
to
the
university
of
michigan,
from
wherever
he
was
going
to
school,
and
yet
the
transfer
admissions
policy,
i
guess
isn't
before
us.
