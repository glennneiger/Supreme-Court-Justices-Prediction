mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
jennifer
gratz
and
patrick
hamacher
were
denied
admission
to
the
university
of
michigan's
flagship
undergraduate
institution,
the
college
of
literature
and
the
science
and
the
arts
under
an
admissions...
under
admissions
policies
that
facially
and
flagrantly
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
history
of
their
case
and
of
the
university's
defense
of
its
discriminatory
admissions
policies
is
a
powerful
argument
about
the
perils
of
entrusting
to
the
discretionary
judgments
of
educators
the
protection
of
the
constitution's
guarantee
of
equality
to
all
individuals.
for
nearly
5
years,
the
university
vigorously
defended
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
the
admissions
systems
that
were
in
place
when
petitioners
gratz
and
hamacher
applied.
these
systems
featured
separate
admissions
guidelines
for
different
races,
protected
or
reserved
seats
in
the
class
for
select
minorities,
that
is
blacks,
hispanics
and
native
americans,
racially-segregated
wait
lists,
and
a
policy
of
never
automatically
rejecting
students
from
their
preferred...
from
the
preferred
minority
groups
while
doing
so
for
others.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
the
transfer
admissions
policy
itself
is
not
before
you...
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--but
the
policy
is
essentially
the
same
with
respect
to
the
consideration
of
race
and
the
court
did...
we
did
certify
a
class
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
mr.
hamacher,
and
i
believe
it
was
december
of
1998.
we
moved
for
class
certification
and
the
district
court
granted
that
certification.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
of
course,
anything
with
respect...
anything
that's
happened
with
respect
to
mr.
hamacher
subsequent
to
that
time
it
seems
to
us
is
not
irrelevant
to
the
consideration
of
standing.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
well,
it's
not
exactly
the--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--the
transfer
policy
considers
race,
your
honor.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
not
in
precisely
the
same
way,
and
the
court...
there...
there
is
nothing...
it
may
be,
perhaps
included
in
parts
of
the
appendix
materials,
but
the
district
court
did
not
address
the
issue
of
the
transfer
policy
when
it...
in
mr.
hamacher's
potential
for
transferring
under
the
policy.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
nothing
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
no.
if
mr.
hamacher
prevails,
then
the
rights
of
many
thousands
of
others
will
have
been
vindicated
and
they
will
be
able
to
compete
under
a
nondiscriminatory
system.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
that's
true.
well,
your
honor
they
would
not
be
able
to
compete
under
a
nondiscriminatory
system
unless
this
particular
system
is
struck
down.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
no,
your
honor,
but
we...
we
do
believe
that
because
the...
the
transfer
policy
and
the
original
admissions
policy
are
fundamentally
the
same
in
the
respect
that
they
both
consider
race
in
the
admissions
process
in
a
way
that
is
discriminatory
and
we
believe
that's--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--that
would
be
true,
your
honor,
if
the
case
were
decided
strictly
on
the
issue
of
narrow
tailoring,
but
my
understanding
is
that
the
university
considers
race
for
a
purpose
to
achieve
a
diversity
that
we
believe
is
not
compelling,
and
if
that
is
struck
down
as
a
rationale,
then
the
law
would
be
same
with
respect
to
the
transfer
policy
as
with
respect
to
the
original
admissions
policy,
your
honor.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
he
would
be...
it
seems
to
me,
perhaps,
your
honor,
entitled
for
relief
for
damages.
he's...
he's
not
at
this
point
seeking
to
be
admitted
to
the
university.
he's
graduated
with
the
passage
of
time,
it's
been
five-plus
years
since
this
suit
was
filed,
mr.
hamacher
has
attended
and
graduated
elsewhere.
it
seems
to
me
he
would
be
entitled
to
damages.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
well...
well,
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
because
the
class
was
certified
with
respect
to
mr.
hamacher,
that
that's
sufficient;
that
if
the...
if
the
system
is
found
unconstitutional,
he
is
an
adequate
class
representative.
sure.
certainly.
one
of
the
critical
things
that
is
demonstrated
in
this
case
is
how
easy
it
is
for
one
system
to
be
disguised
as
another.
what
has
happened
in
this
case
is
that
for
five
years
again,
the
university
defended
the
system
with
its
facially
separate
admission
guidelines,
with
its
reserved
seats,
and
then
in...
two
years
into
this
case,
in
fact,
was
still
using
some
of
these
particular
forms
in
its
admissions
policy.
it
is
an
indication,
i
think,
of
how
difficult
it
is
to
conclude
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
system
that,
for
example,
comports
with
what
justice
powell
indicated
he
was...
he
approved
of
in
the...
in
the
bakke
case.
what
we
have
here
is
a
system
that
was...
is
not
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
any
governmental
interest,
any
compelling
governmental
interest.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
return
to
the
issue
of
diversity
and
the
diversity
issue
as
a...
as
a
compelling
state
interest.
the
fundamental
problem
with
the
diversity
rationale
is
that
it
depends
upon
the
standardless
discretion
of
educators.
it
is
a
discretion
that
would
be
exercised
in
a
number
of
different
respects.
and
we
need
to
be
clear
about
this.
the
university
and
its
amicus
have
all
made
it
clear
that
in
their
judgment
they
ought
to
be
entitled
to
use
race
as
much
as
necessary
in
their
educational
discretion.
if
that
is
the
rule
that
we
end
up
accepting,
then
universities
are
free
in
their
discretion
to
choose
which
races
are
discriminated
against,
which
are
favored.
we
can
have
one
institution
that
discriminates
against
one
group
of
individuals,
and
another
against
another.
we
can
have
with
the...
with
shifting
fashions
and...
and
preferences
and
time,
the
preferences
for
the
races
can
shift.
an
example
of
that
is
found
in
comparing
the
facts
of
this
case
to
the
bakke
case,
wherein
bakke,
asian
americans
were
included
in
the
preference,
and
under
the
university
of
michigan's
systems,
they
are
excluded.
the...
the
exercise
of
discretion
will
extend
to
who's
identified
in
a
particular
race.
it
will
be
for
educators
to
decide
whether
someone
of
a
mixed
race
is
someone
that
is
entitled
to
a
preference.
you
can
have
anomalous
situation
of
the
university's
guidelines
for
example
where
someone
who
is
both
half-white
and
half-black--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
a
matter
essentially
of
self-identification.
so
if
someone
of
mixed
race
who
is
white
and
black
identifies
himself
as
white,
then
as
far
as
the
university
is
concerned,
they
don't
bring
the
diversity
that
they're
looking
for.
if
that
person
identifies
himself
as
black,
then
merely
from
that
identification,
they
have
fallen
within
the
diversity
that
the
university
seeks.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
it...
the
problem--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--that's
true,
your
honor.
i...
i
raised
the
point
because
it...
it
indicates
how
standardless
this
interest
is.
it
is
not
defined
with
respect
to
any
constitutional
principle
like,
for
example,
an
interest
based
on
remedying
discrimination.
it
is
entirely
discretionary
with
the
university.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
well,
again,
justice
breyer,
the
constitutional
relevance
derives
from
the
fact
that
we're
talking
about
a
constitutional
right
here,
the
use
of
race,
which
is
not
the
same
thing
as--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--well,
your
honor,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
the
court
itself
has
made
clear
that
for
an
interest
to
be
compelling,
one
of
the
considerations
that
the
court
must
look
at
is
whether
there
are
standards...
independent,
ascertainable
standards
apart
from
the
discretion
exercised
by,
say,
an
employer
to
determine
whether
the
interest
is
one
that's
compelling
and
one
that
the
court
can
oversee.
that
interest,
that
standard...
that
standard
exists,
for
example,
when
we
have
an
interest
in
remedying
identified
discrimination.
the
court
has
made
it
clear
that
what
with
can
be
done
in
that
case
is
you
can
measure
the
extent
to
which
there
has
been
past
discrimination,
that's
not
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
employer
to
decide,
and
once
you've
measured
the
extent
of
that
discrimination,
you
can
tailor
your
remedy
to
that
interest.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
the
same
standard
would
apply,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
well,
your
honor,
i
want
to
be
clear
about
what
it
is
that
we're
arguing
for
here
today.
we
are
not
suggesting
an
absolute
rule
forbidding
any
use
of
race
under
any
circumstances.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
the
interest
asserted
here
by
the
university,
this
amorphous,
ill-defined,
unlimited
interest
in
diversity
is
not
a
compelling
interest.
nothing
we
argue
today
and
nothing
we
seek
to
do
today
would
undo
the
court's
precedents
that
have
recognized
if
some--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--your
honor,
that
is
not
a
conclusion
that
we
need
to
follow
from
this
court's
decision.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
i
would
not
go
that
far,
justice
stevens,
there
may
be
other
reasons.
i
think
they
would
have
to
be
extraordinary
and
rare,
perhaps,
rising
to
the
level
of
life
or
limb.
we
do
know
that
the
court
has
recognized
past
identified
discrimination.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
weber,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
title
vii
case,
your
honor
and
it's
not
implicated
by
this
decision.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that...
if
the
court
could
resolve
the
issue
consistent
with
title
vii,
which
has
remedial--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--no,
no,
if
this
court
decides
this
case
under
section
1981,
the
only
interest
asserted
here
at
least
is
an
interest
in
diversity
that
we
are
asking
to
strike
down.
it
may
be
that
there
are
some
other
interests,
including
a
remedial
one,
that
would
be
justified
under
some
other
statute.
but
the
issue
is
not
presented.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
the
use
of
race
to
exceed
nonremedial
objectives,
i
think
would
have
problems,
your
honor.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
yes,
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
that's
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
your
honor,
because
there
are
important
constitutional
rights
at
stake.
and
those
rights
are
the
right
to
equal
protection.
and
a
mere
social
benefit
that
is
having
more
minorities
in
particular
occupations
or
the
schools
simply
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
compelling
interest.
it
simply
is
not...
it
doesn't
remedy
a
constitutional
value,
like--
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
--i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
racial
preferences
are
not
the
answer.
if
there
are
problems
again
in
not
getting
a
sufficient
number
of...
if
minorities
are
not
competing
at
levels
of
other
racial
groups
then
we
should
take
steps
to
solve
that
problem.
but
racial
preferences,
because
they
injure
the
rights
of
innocent
people,
because
it's
a
prohibition
contained
in
our
constitution,
simply
aren't
permissible
to
remedy
that
problem.
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kirk
o.
kolbo
with
respect
to
the
point
system,
counsel
has
made
it
sound
as
if
it's
sort
of
a
fortuity
that
the
university
of
michigan
has
an
admissions
system
that
ends
up
admitting...
admitting
virtually
all
minority
students.
in
fact,
i
want
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
record
here.
we
put
in
the
record
the
guidelines
from
the
original
system
that
was
in
place
in
1995
and
1997.
at
the
joint
appendix,
at
page
80,
it's
made
very
clear
that
the
guidelines
were
set
in
1995,
when
jennifer
gratz
applied
to
admit
all
qualified
minority
students.
it's
also
undisputed
in
this
record
that
the
way
the
university
got
to
the
20
points
was
to
statistically
design
it
based
on
the
old
model.
so
what
they've
done
is
they've
taken
the
old
guidelines
that
were
set
to
admit
all
qualified
minority
students,
statistically
figured
out
how
many
points
they
needed
to
give...
to
give
to
students
under
the
new
system
to
replicate
the
old
system,
and
that's
how
we
ended
up
with
20
points.
so
it...
it
strikes
me
as
disingenuous
to
suggest
that
it's
simply
an
accident.
these
policies
have
a
purpose.
they
grant
a
preference
for
a
purpose.
and
the
new
system
does
what
the
old
system
did...
did,
which
is
to
create
a
two-track
system.
it's
not
enough
if
you're
jennifer
gratz
or
patrick
hamacher
to
be
merely
qualified
to
get
admitted
to
the
university.
to
be
admissible
is
not
simply
enough
because
of
their
skin
color.
if
however
you're
a
member
of
one
of
the
minority
students
and
you
meet
those
minimum
qualifications,
that's
sufficient.
if
that's
not
a
two-track
system,
i
can't
imagine
what
one...
what
one
would
actually
look
like.
with
respect
to
test
scores,
a
question
was
made...
a
question
was
asked
about
how
long
are
these
systems
going
to
last.
there's
actually
evidence,
and
this
was
not
put
in
the...
in
the
record
by
the
university,
with
respect
to
test
scores
and
disparities,
but
there's...
there's
also
opposing
opinion
which
has
indicated
that
as
long
as
we
have
these
preferences,
they
create
perverse
incentives.
we've
cited
the
work
of
john
mcwhorter,
for
example,
in
our
reply
brief
indicating
that
test
scores
to
the
extent
that
they're
not
narrowing,
or
to
the
extent
that
the
gaps
are
increasing
may,
in
fact,
be
to
the
fact...
due
to
the
fact
of
these...
of
these
preferences.
with
respect
to
the
hobbesian
choice
that
mr.
payton
has
talked
about,
they
have
resolved
a
different
hobbesian
choice.
the
university
has
decided
that
they
are
willing
to
lower
their
academic
standards
to
get
their
critical
mass.
they've
resolved
that...
that
hobbesian
choice
that
way.
but
they've
resolved
the
other
hobbesian
choice,
how
to
get
those
objectives
and
stay
selective,
they've
resolved
that
hobbesian
choice
on
the
backs
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
individuals
like
jennifer
gratz
and
patrick
hamacher.
they
are
the
ones
that
are
paying
for
the
hobbesian
choice
that
the
university
has
resolved
with...
by
the
use
of
a
two-track
admission
system.
with
respect
to
the
concept
of
critical
mass,
all
i
have
to
say,
if
one
can't
ascertain
from
the
way
it's
defined,
meaningful
means
sufficient,
sufficient
means
critical,
critical
means
sufficient,
that
meets
the
definition,
it
seems
to
me,
of
an
interest
that's
too
amorphous,
too
ill-defined,
too
indefinite,
just
like
the
role
model
theory,
just
like
a
remedy
for
societal
discrimination,
too
indefinite
to
support
the
use
of
a
compelling...
to
suit...
to
use...
to
be
a
basis
for
racial
preferences.
