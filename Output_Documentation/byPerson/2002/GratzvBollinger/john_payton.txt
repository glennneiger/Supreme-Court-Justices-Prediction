mr.
john
payton
mr.
chief
justice
and,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
think
i
want
to
spend
just
a
few
minutes
briefly
setting
the
record
straight
on
why
it
is
the
educational
judgment
of
the
university
of
michigan
that
the
educational
benefits
that
come
from
a
racially
and
ethnically
diverse
student
body
are
crucial
for
all
of
our
students
and
why
those
benefits
do
not
depend
in
any
way
on
the
assumption
that,
for
example,
all
african
americans
think
alike.
ls&a,
our
premiere
undergraduate
institution,
is
an
undergraduate
college,
most
of
its
entering
students
come
in
as
18-year-olds,
about
two-thirds
come
from
michigan,
and
about
half
from
detroit
or
the
greater
detroit
area.
michigan,
i
think
as
everyone
knows
is
a
very
segregated
state.
mr.
john
payton
yes.
half
of
our
students
come
from...
yes.
michigan
is
a
very
segregated
state.
detroit
is
overwhelmingly
black.
its
suburbs
and
the
rest
of
the
state
are
overwhelmingly
white.
while
michigan
is
extreme
in
this
regard,
it's
not
that
extreme
from
the
rest
of
the
country.
the
university's
entering
students
come
from
these
settings
and
have
rarely
had
experiences
across
racial
or
ethnic
lines.
that's
true
for
our
white
students.
it's
true
for
our
minority
students.
they've
not
lived
together.
they've
not
played
together.
they've
certainly
not
gone
to
school
together.
the
result
is
often
that
these
students
come
to
college
not
knowing
about
individuals
of
different
races
and
ethnicities.
and
often
not
even
being
aware
of
the
full
extent
of
their
lack
of
knowledge.
this
gap
allows
stereotypes
to
come
into
existence.
ann
arbor
is
a
residential
campus,
just
about
every
single
entering
student
lives
on
campus
in
a
dorm.
on
campus,
these
18-year
olds
interact
with
students
very
different
from
themselves
in
all
sorts
of
ways,
not
just
race,
not
just
ethnicity,
but
in
all
sorts
of
ways.
students,
i
think
as
we
know,
learn
a
tremendous
amount
from
each
other.
their
education
is
much
more
than
the
classroom.
it's
in
the
dorm,
it's
in
the
dining
halls,
it's
in
the
coffee
houses.
it's
in
the
daytime,
it's
in
the
nighttime.
it's
all
the
time.
here's
how
critical
mass
works
in
these
circumstances.
if
there
are
too
few
african
american
students,
to
take
that
same
example,
there's
a
risk
that
those
students
will
feel
that
they
have
to
represent
their
group,
their
race.
this
comes
from
it
isolation
and
it's
well
understood
by
educators.
it
results
in
these
token
students
not
feeling
completely
comfortable
expressing
their
individuality.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
are
meaningful
numbers
of
african
american
students,
this
sense
of
isolation
dissipates.
mr.
john
payton
it's
what
we've
been
referring
to
as
critical
mass.
mr.
john
payton
critical
mass
is
when
you
have
enough
of
those
students
so
they
feel
comfortable
acting
as
individuals.
mr.
john
payton
i
think
you
know
it,
because
as
educators,
the
educators
see
it
in
the
students
that
come
before
them,
they
see
it
on
the
campus.
mr.
john
payton
yes,
they
do.
this
is
an
incredibly
vibrant
and
complex
campus
that
has
diversity
in
every
conceivable
way.
and
i
think--
mr.
john
payton
--they
do.
in
the
record,
we
actually
have
an
expert
report
that's
not
contradicted
in
any
way
by
professor
raudenbush
and
by
professor
gurin,
just
on
the
issue
of
how
do
you
know
when
you
have
enough
students
in
different
contexts
and
circumstances
that
there
will
be
these
meaningful
numbers.
mr.
john
payton
they
said
that
given
the
numbers
that
have
been
coming
through
in
the
last
several
years,
we
are
just
getting
to
that
critical
mass.
and
the
way
they
analyzed
it
was
to
look
at
the
circumstances
in
which
students
interact.
entering
seminar,
a
dorm
context,
a
student
activities
context,
student
newspaper
context,
to
see
what
would
happen
if
you
distribute
the
students
across
these
small
encounter
opportunities.
mr.
john
payton
no.
the
answer
is
no.
we
have
dormitories
like
i
said.
just
about
every
single
entering
student
stays
in
a
dormitory.
we
do
not
have
any
dormitories
where
your
entrance
into
it
is
governed
by
your
race.
but
we
have
tremendous
representation
in
our
dormitories
because
everybody
has
to
stay
there,
okay?
so
the
answer
is--
mr.
john
payton
--the
answer
is
there
is
no
african
american
dormitory,
put
it...
the
full
answer
is
more
complex.
after
students
are
there
for
their
first
year,
they
can
choose
to
move
off
campus.
they
can
choose
to
stay
on
campus.
many
stay
on
campus,
many
move
off
campus.
ann
arbor
is
a
college
town
and
off
campus
is
actually
in
the
larger
campus
community
and
what
they
do
off
campus
is
obviously
up
to
the
students
themselves,
but
i
think
that's...
you
know,
that's
the
real
world.
if
you
have
the
meaningful
numbers
of
minority
students,
what
then
happens
is
that
students
will
see
a
range
of
ideas,
a
range
of
viewpoints
from
and
among
those
students
and
they
will
then
see
things
that
they
may
not
have
expected,
similarities
and
differences,
and
those
in
turn
will
have
the
result
of
undermining
stereotypes,
you
know,
and
this
happens
for
the
minority
students,
and
the
white
students.
this
happens
for
all
the
students.
you
know,
the
benefits
from
this
affect
every
single
student
that
comes
through.
and
they're
dependent
on
their
being
meaningful
numbers,
or
critical
mass,
of
minority
students,
or
the
benefits
don't
come
about.
that's
the
interest
that
the
university
is
asserting.
that's
why
they
think
that
this
is
so
crucial.
education,
understanding,
produces
citizens
and
leaders
in
our
complex
society.
mr.
john
payton
here's
how
our
system
works
and
i
believe
it's
not
a
quota
at
all
and
i
can
believe...
i
can
simply
explain
this.
the
way
it
works,
an
application
comes
in,
it
is
reviewed
on
the
basis...
every
single
application
is
read
in
its
entirety
by
a
counselor,
every
single
application.
it
is
in
fact
judged
on
the
basis
of
the
selection
index,
which
has
the
20
points
for
race
and
20
points
for
athletics,
but
it
also
has
all
sorts
of
other
things
that
it
values,
in
state,
underrepresented
state,
underrepresented
county
within
michigan,
socioeconomic
status,
what
your
school
is
like,
what
the
curriculum
that
you
took
at
your
school
is
like.
mr.
john
payton
your
grades--
mr.
john
payton
--the
way
it
works
is
that
every
application
comes
through
and
it's
read
in
its
entirety,
it
is
evaluated
taking
all
of
these
factors
into
account,
and
then
based
upon
the
number
that
comes
off
the
selection
index
which
can
go
up
to
150,
the
students
are
all
competing
against
each
other.
there
is
a
score
that
is
evaluated
throughout
the
year,
because
there's
an
overenrollment
problem
that
always
has
to
be
managed
and
if
the
score
is
higher,
you
are
in,
and
that
doesn't
matter
about
anything
other
than
what
the
score
is.
in
addition,
the
counselor
can
on
the
basis
of
three
factors
see
that
an
application
is
reviewed
by
the
admissions
review
committee.
mr.
john
payton
yes.
sometimes
twice.
because
every
application
is
read
when
it
comes
in,
and
those
that
a
counselor
flags
that...
because
they
find
that
there's
three
factors
you
have
to
have
flag
an
application...
academically
able
to
do
the
work,
above
a
certain
selection
index
score
and
also
contributes
at
least
one
of
various
factors
that
we
want
to
see
in
our
student
body,
including
underrepresented
minority
status,
but
also
very
high
class
rank
and
a
whole
range
of
other
things.
mr.
john
payton
i
think
we're
taking
that
term
as
the
federal
government
has
used
it,
and
the
reason
asians
aren't
included,
just
to
pick
up
one
of
the--
mr.
john
payton
--i
think
there
are
three
minority
groups,
you
know.
let
me
just
go
back
and
answer
what
we
want.
mr.
john
payton
i
think
this
is
actually
a
very
important
point.
they
are
underrepresented
in
our
applicant
pool.
mr.
john
payton
compared
to...
we
have
very
small
pools
of
african
americans,
for
example,
that
are
qualified
to
the
extent
that
we
require
students
to
be
qualified
to
do
the
work
at
the
university
of
michigan
and
what
that
means
is
that
if
we
didn't
take
race
into
account,
we
would
not
be
able
to
get
the
numbers
of
those
students,
the
critical
mass,
necessary
for
the
educational
benefits
that
we
want.
mr.
john
payton
that's
underrepresented.
mr.
john
payton
it's
actually
not
a
percentage
at
all
and
it
really
is
driven
by
the
educational
benefits
that
we
want
from
our
diverse
student
body.
if
we
had
in
our
applicant
pool
sufficient
numbers
of
minority
students,
african
americans,
for
example--
mr.
john
payton
--so
that
when
we
made
our
selection--
mr.
john
payton
--yes.
mr.
john
payton
a
sufficient
number
so
that
when
we
made
our
selections,
we
were
achieving
the
critical
mass
of
students
that
we
need
for
the
benefits
i
described.
that
is
not
a
fixed
precise
number
at
all,
as
you've
heard.
it
is...
that's
simply
not
the
nature
of
the
critical
mass.
but
when
you're
trying
to
figure
out
whether
or
not
in
your
applicant
pool,
you
have
sufficient
numbers,
so
that
the
normal
operation
of
our
process
would
yield
a
critical
mass,
that's
underrepresented.
we
are
underrepresented
with
respect
to
hispanics,
with
respect
to
african
americans
and
with
respect
to
native
americans.
mr.
john
payton
we
do
have
sufficient
numbers
in
our
applicant
pool
to
achieve
the
critical
mass
that
we're
achieving.
we're
not
taking...
you're
right
we're
not--
mr.
john
payton
--but
we're
not
taking
students
that
aren't
qualified,
you
are
correct
about
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
payton
it
is
that
significant
to
us.
but
i
think
that--
mr.
john
payton
--i
think
that
decision
which
would
say
that
we
have
to
choose,
would
be
a
hobbesian
choice
here.
our
premiere
institutions
of
higher
education,
i'd
say,
are
part
of
our
crown
jewels.
we
have
great
educational
institutions
in
this
country.
the
university
of
michigan
is
one
of
them.
i
think
we
are
the
envy
of
the
world.
if
we
had
to
say,
gee,
our
educators
tell
us
that
it
is
crucial
that
for
the
full
education
they
want
for
those
students,
all
of
those
students
we
needed
for
a
student
body,
that
the
decision
is,
oh,
gee,
we
want
to
you
decide
to
either
have
a
poor
education
for
the
essentially
white
students
and/or
you
can
say,
change
what
you
are
as
an
institution.
i
think
we
get
to
decide
what
our
mission
is.
i
think
the
constitution
gives
us
some
leeway
in
deciding
what
our
mission
is
and
how
we
define
ourselves.
mr.
john
payton
no.
i
think
what
we're
saying
is
we
can
achieve
both
of
those
things,
because,
in
fact,
achieving
the
educational
benefits
that
come
from
a
diverse
student
body
can
be
achieved,
given
our
mission,
if
we
can
go
about
selecting
students
in
a
way
to
achieve
the
critical
mass
of
minority
students
that
we
need.
we
want
both
of
those
things.
we
think
that--
mr.
john
payton
--yes.
mr.
john
payton
i
have
two
responses.
the
first
is
to
say
that
it
is
individualized
if
that
white
student
actually
was
socioeconomically
disadvantaged,
that
could
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
john
payton
yes.
mr.
john
payton
yes.
mr.
john
payton
well,
he
might--
mr.
john
payton
--the
answer
is
we
value
both
of
those
aspects
of
diversity.
we
want
both
of
those
represented
in
our
student
body,
all
right,
if
they
tie,
they
will
being
judged
exactly
the
same
as
far
as
how
the
selection
index
works.
mr.
john
payton
i'm
saying
that
each
student--
mr.
john
payton
--no,
no.
they
both--
mr.
john
payton
--they
both
receive
individualized
consideration.
they're
both
reviewed
in
their
totality.
they
both
may
be
sent
to
the
admissions
review
committee
where
they
get
a
second
reading.
in
bakke--
mr.
john
payton
--the
admissions
review
committee...
about
70
percent
of
the
applications
that
it
reviews
in
any
given
year
are
white
student
applications
that
are
sent
to
it.
okay.
it
can
reach
its
judgment
irrespective
of
whatever
happened
in
the
selection
index
score.
mr.
john
payton
they
can...
actually
once
it
goes
to
them
they
simply
look
at
the
application
and
make
a
judgment.
mr.
john
payton
it
does.
mr.
john
payton
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
john
payton
and
it
does.
in
bakke,
where
justice
powell
says
that
he
could
look
at
one
example
of
an
admissions
policy
and
he
discusses
briefly
the
harvard
plan
and
then
he
has
a
long
quote
from
it,
there
is
the
footnote
50
that
ms.
mahoney
mentioned.
in
both
footnote
50
and
footnote
51
there
is
a
citation
to
this
study
by
carnegie
and
he
introduces
that
by
saying
in
the
footnote
there
are
in
this
study
examples
of
the
actions
by
other
leading
institutions,
trying
to
get
diverse
student
bodies.
that
study
indicates
that
there
are
plenty
of
other
models
where
in
fact
some
effort
to
come
up
with
a
system
to
handle
these
different
factors
was
successful.
mr.
john
payton
i
don't
know,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
payton
actually--
mr.
john
payton
--that
is
not
correctly
describing
what
happens.
the
way
the
policy
works
and
the
way
it
is
implemented
is
how
i
described
the
policy.
in
fact,
the
results
of
the
policy
are
that
most
of
the
qualified
minority
applications
do
end
up
getting
admitted.
that's
not
the
design.
the
design
is
here's
how
you
do
it,
here's
how
the
decisions
are
made,
either
on
the
selection
index
score,
some
are
sent
to
the
admissions
review
committee.
most
of
those
that
are
sent
to
the
admissions
review
committee
are
in
fact
not
minority
applications,
but
the
design
is
not
gee,
admit
all
qualified
minorities,
the
design
is
to
take
these
different
factors
into
account
in
order
to
achieve
the
student
body
that
we
think
is
crucial
here.
mr.
john
payton
i
believe
that
is
the
case,
all
the
record
says
in
this
is
that
virtually
all
of
the
minority
students,
as
a
result
of
the
policy
ended
up
being
admitted.
i
think
there
are
certainly
some,
i
can't
give
you
one,
i
can't
give
you
one,
but
there
are
certainly
some
where
if
you
work
it
out,
you
can
see
that
won't
happen.
mr.
john
payton
the
design
is
to
make
sure
we
get
to
the
critical
mass
of
the
meaningful
numbers
and
given
the
small
pool
size
we
have,
the
way
it
operates
is
as
you
just
described,
but
that's
the
way
it
operates,
the
design
is
to
make
sure
we
get
the
critical
mass
of
students
that
are,
in
fact,
necessary
for
the
educational
benefits
that
we
are
asserting
here.
mr.
john
payton
i
think
that
the
reason
i
referenced
the
two
expert
reports
by
professor
raudenbush
and
professor
gurin
is
to
try
to
see
this...
those
two
reports
try
to
put
this
in
sort
of
an
everyday
example,
you
know,
students
don't
interact
with
the
student
body
as
a
whole,
they
interact
in
small
settings
and
it's
to
see
if
you
see
what
our
minority
student
population
is
how
that
would
distribute
into
these
small
settings.
and
on
the
basis
of
how
that
distribution
works,
professor
gurin
looked
at
it
to
see
whether
or
not
that
looked
like
that
would
be
generating
the
interactions
that
she
would
expect
for
these
educational
benefits.
mr.
john
payton
no.
mr.
john
payton
no.
the
answer
is
no.
and--
mr.
john
payton
--it
does,
and
i
think
you
described
it
exactly
as
how
it
has
come
about
with
respect
to
diversity
and
critical
mass.
in
the
harvard
plan,
in
justice
powell's
discussion
of
the
harvard
plan,
he
clearly
acknowledges
and...
because
the
plan
acknowledges
that
you
must
have
meaningful
numbers
and
it
means
more
than
token
numbers
and
there's
clearly
an
acknowledgement
that
if
you
have
too
few
numbers
you
get
the
dynamics
of
isolation
that
you
just
discussed.
mr.
john
payton
i
think
that
in
all
of
this,
you
know,
there's
a
false
precision
here
that
everybody
wants,
which
is
tell
me
exactly
what
this
is,
and
i
don't
think
it
exactly
works
like
that.
you
know,
we
have
a
lot
of
experience
as,
you
know,
an
educational
institution
about
what
has
happened
on
our
campus
and
what
has
worked.
the
class
that
we've
had,
the
entering
classes
that
we've
had
over
the
last
4
years
or
so,
have
ranged
from
12
percent
to
17
percent,
okay?
twelve
percent
to
17
percent.
i'm
not
saying
it's
a
percent
and
i'm
not
saying
it's
that
fixed
range,
but
12
percent
to
17
percent
is
sort
of
how
it
is
ranged
and
that
has
generated
the
representation
in
the
small
groups
that
is
what
is
working
to
achieve
some
of
these
educational
benefits
that
we're
talking
about.
but
it's
not
quite
that
precise
as
far
as
how
all
of
this
works.
mr.
john
payton
i
think
that
we
all
certainly
expect
it
to
come
to
an
end.
i
think
we're
all
quite
surprised
if
we
looked
back
at
bakke,
in
1978,
i
think
all
of
us
would
be
quite
surprised
from
that
vantage
point
to
realize
that
today
in
michigan
students
live
in
such
segregated
circumstances
growing
up,
it's
really
quite
unbelievable.
we
could
not
have
foreseen
that.
i
think
people
thought
that
we
were
coming
together
in
a
way
and
that
hasn't
occurred.
that's
created
some
educational
challenges
and
opportunities.
the
test
score
gap,
i
think
is
narrowing...
we
put
that
in
our
brief.
i
think
we're
all
quite
optimistic
about
how
this
is
going
to
progress.
there
is
progress.
i
think
the
pool
is
increasing.
but
i
can't
give
you
how
long
is
it
going
to
last.
i
think
we're
all
quite
confident
that
it's
only
going
to
last
for
x
number
of
finite
years,
i
just
can't
answer
with
any
precision
that
question
either.
mr.
john
payton
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
what
the
more
individualized
assessment
would
be
here.
i'm
not
saying
that
obviously
there
are
things
that
could
be
done
differently.
we've
done
things
differently.
the
two
schools
do
things
quite
differently.
but
i
think
we're
both
trying
to
achieve
the
critical
mass,
that
i
think
there's
no
dispute
at
all
from
anyone
that
the
critical
mass
is
essential
to
get
the
educational
benefits
that
we're
talking
about.
if
this
goal
is
a
compelling
interest,
then
critical
mass
is
essential
to
its
attainment,
given
the
small
pool
size
that
we're
talking
about.
can
it
be
crafted
in
another
way?
obviously,
from
the
amicus
briefs,
there
are
a
lot
of
schools
that
do
it
in
different
ways.
we're
doing
it
in
a
very
individualized
way
that
in
fact
does
allow
students
to
compete.
every
student
is
evaluated
on
the
same
criteria.
you
know,
head
to
head.
we
do
take
race
into
account
in
the
way
that
you've
heard
described.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
lacks
the
individuality
that
you
would
be
striving
for.
this
is,
you
know,
an
enormously
important
case.
when
justice
powell
said
in
bakke
that
it's
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
nation's
future
depends
upon
leaders
trained
through
wide
exposure
to
the
ideas
and
mores
of
students
as
diverse
as
this
nation
of
many
peoples,
i
think
that
statement
was
absolutely
correct
then.
i
think
it
is,
you
know,
it
has
never
been
truer
than
it
is
today.
this
is
of
enormous
importance
and
correct,
not
just
to
the
university
of
michigan,
i'd
say
to
all
of
higher
education
and
i
think
to
our
country
as
a
whole
to
be
able
to
do
things
that
bring
us
together,
that
bring
us
understanding,
that
result
in
tolerance
and,
i'd
say,
make
us
the...
more...
closer
to
the
day
that
we
all
look
forward
to
when,
in
fact,
we
are
beyond
some
of
these
problems
that
we've
been
discussing
rather
intensely
here
today.
mr.
john
payton
yes,
i
do.
i
think
they
do
in
all
sorts
of
ways.
they
are
certainly
producing
black
students,
white
students,
hispanic
students,
native
american
students
who
go
out
into
our
communities
and
change
their
communities.
mr.
john
payton
i
think
that--
mr.
john
payton
--i
think,
you
know,
some
of
our
other
schools,
the
nonselective
schools,
actually
some
can
end
up
with
completely
undiverse
populations
as
well;
that
the
fact
that
a
school
does
not
have
selectivity
doesn't
mean
that
the
community
college,
in
fact,
is
diverse.
so
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
follows
at
all
that
if
you
lower
your
standards
and
distribute
this
all
across
the
country,
we
will
get
these
educational
benefits,
you
know,
throughout
our
educational
system.
mr.
john
payton
yes.
mr.
john
payton
yes.
you
mean
do
they
benefit
if
they
had
a
racially
and
ethnically
diverse
student
body?
i
believe
most
every
single
one
of
them
do
have
diverse
student
bodies.
