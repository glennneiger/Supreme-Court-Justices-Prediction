justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
the
reason
that
these--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
it
entirely
discretionary
when
you
read
a
set
of
exam
books,
you
know,
it's
highly
subjective,
which
is
a
little
better
than
its--
often
i'd
make
a
mistake
as
a
professor,
so...
so
the
fact
that
there
aren't
written-down
standards
is...
is...
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
of
the
constitutional
relevance
of
that
when
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
something
lawyers
don't
normally
do,
which
is
to
select
among
people
individually
considered
which
one
is
better
for
this
particular
slot.
businesspeople
do
that,
lawyers
don't
except
when
they're
hiring.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
but
i
don't...
if
you
said
to
a
businessperson,
this
doesn't
have
standards,
such
a
thing,
i
think
they
might
laugh
and
say
my
job
and
experience
is
to
select
who's
better
for
this
slot,
so...
so
i'm
not
sure
of
the
constitutional
relevance
of
what
you
say,
which
seems
to
me
to
me
to
grow
out
of
the
nature
of
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes,
but
i
mean,
as
justice
stevens
just
said,
the
constitutional
problem
consists
of
the
injury
to
your
client
and
that
injury
is
the
same
irrespective
of
the
precise
nature
of
the
standards
on
the
other
side.
and...
and
what
i'm
sort
of
struggling
for
here
is
i
see
your
point,
if
you
say
you
cannot
use
race
at
all,
period.
no
matter
what.
that's
a...
that's
a
clear
position,
which
i
think
is
one
of
your
positions.
but
once
you
depart
from
that,
now
i'm...
i'm
interested
in
the
detail.
at
that
point
i'm
not
quite
sure
the
relevance
of
what
you're
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
suppose
you
say
you
used
the
word
extraordinary
as
compelling
justification,
and
the
other
side
says,
yes,
extraordinary,
we're
280
million
people,
we
have
large
racial
diversity
within
the
country,
the
world
is
even
more
diverse,
and
we
think
from
the
point
of
view
of
business,
the
armed
forces,
law,
et
cetera,
that
this
is
an
extraordinary
need
to
have
diversity
among
elites
throughout
the
country.
that
without
it,
the
country
will
be
much
worse
off.
that's
what
we're
being
told.
in
fact,
the
country
might
not
function
well
at
all.
and
we
have
to
train
those
people.
we
have
to.
all
right,
now,
how
can
you
say,
or
can
you
say,
that
isn't
extraordinary?
that
isn't
a
question
of
life
or
limb
for
the
country?
it
isn't
really
that
necessary,
when
so
many
people
are
telling
us
the
contrary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
that
is
not...
the
argument
is
basically
that,
look,
people
who
have
grown
up
in
america
and
are
black,
regardless
of
race,
no,
not
regardless
of
race,
regardless
of
socioeconomic
background
have
probably,
though
not
certainly,
shared
the
experience
of
being
subject
to
certain
stereotypical
reactions
from
people
throughout
their
lives.
now,
that
may
have
led
them
to
react
one
way,
or
another
way
or
not
react
at
all.
and
indeed
many
of
the
students
in
our
class
will
have
stereotypical
reactions.
and
it's
good
for
them
as
well
as
for
everyone
else
to
rid
themselves
of
those
reactions.
and
we
want
people
in
this
school
of
all
kinds
who
are
black,
because
that
will
be
helpful
education.
now,
that's
their
argument,
i
think,
in
that
respect,
not
the
argument
that
all
black
people
are
poor,
not
the
argument
that
all
black
people
have
been
discriminated
against,
not
the
argument
that
all
black
people
share
a
point
of
view.
as
i
read
it,
that's
their
argument.
and
so
you're
reply
to
that
argument
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
go
ahead.
are
you
finished?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wanted
to
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
the
point
system
here,
does
it
meet
the
opinion
of
justice
powell
in
bakke
when
that
was
called
for
individualized
consideration?
now,
the
concern
that
it
does
not,
is
that
you
under
this
system
would
seem
to
have
the
possibility
that
two
students...
one
is
a
minority,
african
american,
one
is
not,
majority,
and
they
seem
academically
approximately
the
same
and
now
we
give
the
black
student
20
points
and
the
white
student,
let's
say,
is
from
the
poorest
family
around
and
is
also
a
great
athlete,
and
he
just
can't
overcome
that
20
points...
the
best
he
can
do
is
tie.
and
so
that's
the
argument
that
this
is
not
individualized
consideration.
and
i
want
to
be
sure
i
know
what
your
response
is
to
that
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
remember
he
has
that
and
gets
20
points
for
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he
also
is
a
great
athlete
and
i've
constructed
this
example
to
make
it
difficult
for
you,
and...
but
i
mean
you
see
he
can
only
get
20
points,
no
matter
how
poor
he
is.
and
no
matter
how
great
an
athlete
he
is
as
well,
and
the...
let's
say
the
black
student
who
has
neither
ties
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
on
individualized
consideration,
the
black
student
might
lose,
if
there
were
the
individualized
consideration.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's...
and
that's
what
you're
giving
him.
now
what
is
the
answer
i'm...
i'm
trying
to
find
your
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
in
those
circumstances,
because
we
have
the
white
student
who
is
both
a
good
athlete
and
also
very
poor,
and
the
other
student,
the
minority
is
not,
could
that
be
sent
to
the...
the
individual...
could
that
be
sent
to
the
review
committee
and
the
review
committee
would
say,
well,
we
have
a
special
circumstance
here,
and
even
though
the
points
tie,
nonetheless
when
we
look
at
it
carefully,
we
see
that
the
white
student
has
these
extra
pluses,
despite
the
points,
we
let
in
the
white
student?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
can
ignore
the
points?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
want
a
clear
answer
to
this.
that
review
committee
can
look
at
the
applications
individually
and
ignore
the
points?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
the
answer
is
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
law
school
context,
there
was
testimony,
i
think
from
one
of
the
admissions
officers
that
said
5
percent
is
too
few,
10
percent
might
suffice.
and
he's
talking
in
respect
to
what
is
a
critical
mass.
now,
do
people
coalesce
around
numbers
like
that
or
is
that
just
out
of...
what
do
i
do
with
that
piece
of
testimony?
