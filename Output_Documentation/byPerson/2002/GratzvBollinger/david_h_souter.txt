yes,
but
isn't...
isn't...
i
mean,
mechanics
is
another
word
for
tailoring.
and
they're
saying
we
have
tailored
it
differently.
our
objectives
are
the
same.
we
may
be
reaching
those
objectives
in
roughly
the...
the
same
proportions,
but
the
argument
is
an
argument
about
tailoring
and
we've
changed
the
tailoring.
justice
david

and
atlethics,
too,
i
think?
justice
david

souter
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that
number
one,
it's
not
stigmatizing,
because
the
box
study
certainly
didn't
show
that
it
was,
and
number
two,
the
objective
is
not
to
show
that
there
is
a
correlation
between
race
and
one
point
of
view.
the
objective
is
to
show
students
what
the
correlation
or
no
correlation
is
between
races
and
points
of
view.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
michigan
plan
is
equally
consistent
with
the
latter
interpretation
as
with
the
former.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
design
is
to
admit
a
higher
percentage
of
the
qualified
minority
applicants
that
you
get,
given
the
numbers
that
there
are
today,
because
if
you
do
that
you
won't
get
your
mix?
justice
david
h.
souter
has
anyone
at
michigan
ever
defined
critical
mass
as
being
anything
more
specific
than
something
beyond
token
numbers?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
the
criteria
used
by
the
admissions
committee,
did
anyone
put
a
percentage
figure
or
a
specific
number--
justice
david
h.
souter
--beyond
the
concept
you've
got
to
get
more
than
just
token
representation?
