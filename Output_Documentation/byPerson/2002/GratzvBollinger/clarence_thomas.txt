mr.
payton,
do
you
think
that
your
admissions
standards
overall
at
least
provide
some
headwind
to
the
efforts
that
you're
taking
about?
justice
clarence
thomas
you
may
have
misunderstood
me.
i
mean
the...
ms.
mahoney
said
earlier
that
the
problem
of
law
school
admissions,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor,
that
it
was
for
the
elite
schools,
it
was
more
a
problem
at
the
elite
schools,
when
she
was
talking
about
boalt
hall,
for
example,
you
meant...
you
suggested
or
alluded
to
in
your
argument
today
that,
you
know,
you
don't
want
to
choose
between
being
an
elite
school
and
the
whole
diversity
issue.
it...
would
it
be
easier
to
accomplish
the
latter
if
the
former
were
adjusted,
that
is
the
overall
admissions
standard?
justice
clarence
thomas
now,
i
know
you
don't
want
to
make
the
choice,
but
will
you
at
least
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
tension?
justice
clarence
thomas
now...
about
10
terms
ago,
we
had
the
university
of
mississippi
higher
ed.
case
in
here--
justice
clarence
thomas
--and
the
argument
was
made
that
the
historically...
the
hbcs,
the
historically
black
colleges
provided
a
different
benefit
to
minorities.
would
the
same
arguments
with
respect
to
diversity
apply
to
those
institutions?
