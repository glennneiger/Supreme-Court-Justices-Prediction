--are
you
sure
that
the
transfer
policy
is
the
same
as
the
admissions
policy
for
new
freshmen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
didn't
find
any
such
finding.
there
was
some
little
material
in
the
record
that
gave
me
a
different
thought
about
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
it
considered
race,
but
not
in
precisely
the
same
way
as
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
that
would
be
true
even
if
he
doesn't
have
standing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
if
it's
struck
down,
but
that...
that
begs
the
question
of
whether
the
named
plaintiff
has
standing
to
represent
a
class
of
people
who
want
to
get
into
the
freshman
class.
he
wants
to
get
in
as
a
transferring
student.
i
mean,
it...
maybe
there's
standing,
but
the
mere
fact
that
if
he
wins
everybody
will
benefit
certainly
doesn't
speak
to
the
question
whether
he
has
standing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
therefore
if
you're
right
that
any
consideration
of
a
race
is
enough
to
condemn
the
program,
then
he
would
have
standing,
but
if
it...
if
it
requires
analysis
of
the
particular
components
of
the
policy,
then
we
ought
to
know
whether
the
transfer
policy
is
the
same
as
the
original
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--one
thing
i
don't
quite
understand
what
difference
does
it
make
to
your
client
whether
they're
three
or
four
races
or
five
or
six
races
as
long
as
she's
not
one
of
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
she's
equally
being
discriminated
against
as
a
caucasian,
no
matter
how
many
other
races
are
preferred.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
i
think
you
are
arguing
that
anything
except
remedies
for
past
discrimination
is
impermissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i...
i
think
that's
your
position,
is
it
not?
that
the
only
permissible
use
of
race
is
as
a
remedy
for
past
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
first
the
changes
were
sufficient
to
convince
the
district
judge
that
it
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
constitutional
line?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
argument
is
that
you
need
to
have
enough
of
them
to
demonstrate
that
the
point
of
view
does
not
always
fit
just
one
person.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
was
a
finding
i
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
also
forbidden
for
the
united
states
military
academy?
