justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
court
agreed
with
him
as
far
as
the
program
that
was
in
place
when
he
applied.
the
court,
i
thought,
held
that
program
unconstitutional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
but
upheld
the
program
that
came
into
being
after
his
application,
and
he
hasn't
reapplied
under
the
new...
but
he...
but
there
was
a
class
certified,
so
i
suppose
you
could
substitute
another
plaintiff,
someone
who
is
applying
under
the
current
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kolbo,
because
you
mentioned
the
employer
and
the
employer's
judgment,
i
gathered
from
your
brief
that
this
case
is
not
simply
about
public
universities.
employment...
because
you
bring
up
1981
and
you
bring
up
title
vi...
under
title
vi,
this
case
is
as
much
about
harvard
as
it
is
about
michigan,
isn't
that
true?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it...
and
in
the
private
sector,
employment
in
the
private
sector,
there's
1981.
so
there,
too.
so
this
case
is
much
larger
than
private...
public...
public
universities.
it's
all
colleges
and
universities,
and
it's
the
entire
realm
of
employment
if
you're
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
far
as--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
weber,
to
take
a
specific
case?
employment
setting,
the
employer
says
i
don't
want
to
confess
to
having
been
a
past
discriminator,
but
i'm
willing
to
engage
in
this
voluntary
affirmative
action.
i
take
it
that
that
would
be
impermissible
if
we
adopt
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
1981,
then...
then
the
person
who
was
attacking
it
on
grounds
that
it's
racially
discriminatory
just
says
my
lawsuit
is
under
1981,
which
it
could
be
as
well
as
title
vii
and
then
what
is
the
result?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
suit
is
brought
under
1981,
the
court
can
decide
what
the
plaintiff's
complaint
should
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no...
this
is
a
voluntary
affirmative
action,
no
admission
of
prior
discrimination.
i
gather
if
someone
brought
a
1981
suit,
to
stop
that,
your
theory
is
that
that
person
would
prevail?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
the
same
20
points
given
socioeconomic
status
also
had
20
points?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
got
only
one
20?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
you
were
an
athlete
you
wouldn't
get
race?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general...
we're
part
of
a
world,
and
this
problem
is
a
global
problem.
other
countries
operating
under
the
same
equality
norm
have
confronted
it.
our
neighbor
to
the
north,
canada,
has,
the
european
union,
south
africa,
and
they
have
all
approved
this
kind
of,
they
call
it
positive
discrimination.
do
we...
they
have
rejected
what
you
recited
as
the
ills
that
follow
from
this.
should
we
shut
that
from
our
view
at
all
or
should
we
consider
what
judges
in
other
places
have
said
on
this
subject?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
payton,
do
you
know
the
origin
of
critical
mass
that
is
being
spoken
of
here
as
though
it
were
something
that
were
invented?
i
know
it
goes
back
at
least
with
respect
to
the
enrollment
of
women
in
law
school,
the
schools
talked
about
we
want
to
get
a
critical
mass,
so
women
will
feel
welcome
because
when
they
were
one
at
a
time
curiosities
they
did
have
to
do
as
you
said
defend...
they
were
representatives
of
their
sex
and
if
they
failed,
all
women
failed.
once
they
had
a
critical
mass,
it
was
no
longer
necessary,
the
woman
was
free
to
be
who
she
was.
but
that
term
i
certainly
was
familiar
with
that
term
used
in
that
setting.
it's...
it
comes
from
sociology,
doesn't
it?
