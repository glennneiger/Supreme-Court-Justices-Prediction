so
if
the
university
president
or
the
dean
told
you
just
what
justice
breyer
said,
you
would
tell
them
there's...
and
that
we
have
underrepresentation
of
minorities,
you
would
tell
them
there's
nothing
you
can
do
about
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
the
stipulation
is
that
it
did
not
change
the
substance
of
how
race
and
ethnicity
were
considered.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
where
we
are
is,
there's
an
assumption,
you
may
not
agree
with
it,
but
it's
one
beginning
assumption
in
this
area,
that
there
may
not
be
a
quota,
every...
all
of
the
eloquent
things
you
said
could
be
easily
met
by
a
quota.
that...
let's
just
assume
for
argument,
we
cannot
do.
i
have
to
say
that
in...
in
looking
at
your
program,
it
looks
to
me
like
this
is
just
a...
a
disguised
quota.
you
have
a...
a
minority
student
who
works
very,
very
hard,
very
proud
of
his
athletics,
he
gets
the
same
number
of
points
as
a
minority
person
who
doesn't
have
any
athletics...
that
to
me
looks
like
an
overt
quota.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
you're
saying
is
that
race
is
individualized
consideration?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
otherwise
you're
saying
that
only
in
the
hypothetical
given
that
only
the
white
student
receives
individualized
consideration?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
some
are
more
equal
than
others?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
court
were
to
say
that
the
20-point
system
and
the
law
school
system
looked
just
too
much
like
a
quota
and
that
quotas
are
impermissible?
as
of
that
point,
is
it
our
burden
to
tell
you
what
other
systems
to
use
or
is
it
your
burden
to
come
up
with
some
other
system,
say,
more
individualized
assessment
in
order
to
attain
some
of
the
goals
you
wish
to
attain?
