mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
university
of
michigan
admissions
program
has
created
a
separate
path
and
a
separate
door
for
preferred
minorities.
for
those
groups,
if
they
meet
basic
if
they
meet
basic
qualifications,
their
path
is
always
clear
and
their
door
is
always
open.
nonpreferred
racial
groups
face
rigorous
competition
to
get
through
the
other
door.
the
university
admits
that
race
is
such
an
overarching
factor
in
its
admissions
process
that
eventually
every
qualified
underrepresented
minority
applicant
will
be
admitted.
the
20
point
bonus,
which
is
one
full
grade
point,
nearly
twice
the
benefit
of
a
perfect
sat
score,
and
six
times
better
than
an
outstanding
essay,
the...
that
bonus
is
actually
unnecessary
with
the
way
the
plan
actually
works,
because
every
qualified
candidate
who
gets
the
bonus
gets
into
the
university.
it
might
just
as
well
be
an
admissions
ticket.
the
university
acknowledges
that
its
pre-1999
admissions
program
used
separate
grids,
separate
qualifications,
separate
standards
and
protected
seats.
they
acknowledge
that
this
system
was...
which
was
held
unconstitutional
and
was
not
challenged,
yet
they
stipulated
that
the
only
changes
that
they
made
from
that
system
affected
only
the
mechanics,
not
the
substance
of
how
race
and
ethnicity
were
considered
in
the
admissions
process.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the...
the
university...
we...
we
respectfully
disagree
with
that
conclusion,
because
the...
the
university
itself
admitted
that
it
only
changed
the
mechanics.
it
intended
to
produce
the
same--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
submit
justice
souter,
that
the
changes
which
they
referred
to
as
mechanics
were
cosmetics,
that
ultimately,
the
system
was
intended
to,
and
they
acknowledge,
to
produce
the
same
outcome
as
the
prior
system.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
correct,
justice
kennedy.
and
what
the
court
only
needs
to
look
at
the
operation
of
the
system.
that
20
point
bonus
means
that
if
you
pass
the
minimum
qualification
standards
at
the
university
of
michigan,
you
were
admitted.
everyone
else
just
like
in
the
davis
program,
had
to
compete...
people
that
were
not
in
the
preferred
races,
who
were
not
on
the
preferred
class
had
to
compete
with
one
another.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
and
you
couldn't
get
both.
but
if
you
had...
whether...
whatever
your
background,
whether
you
were
an
athlete
or
not,
you
got
the
20
points
solely
because
of
your
race.
there
were
other
systems,
that
the
constitution
doesn't
implicate.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
but
if
you...
irrespective
of
those
other
factors,
if
you
didn't
get
the...
the
20
point
bonus
for
being
an
athlete
or...
for
socioeconomic
conditions,
the
only
thing
that
was
required
was
to
be
a
member
of
the
preferred
race.
like
the
other
program
that
we're
hearing
today,
the
same
state,
the
state
board
of
regents,
this
plan
violates
every
standard
that
this
court
has
set
for
the
examination
of
racial
preferences.
it
is
a
thinly
disguised
quota
because
there's
only
one
path,
a
segment...
justice
o'connor
put
it
this
way
in
croson...
a
segment
of
the
class
reserved
exclusively
for
certain
minority
groups.
it
isn't
tied
to
a
particular
number.
it's
a
segment
of
the
class
reserved
on
the
basis
of
race.
it
is...
it
is
based
upon
the
stigmatizing
notion
that
if
you
are
a
certain
race,
you
think
a
certain
way
or
if
you're
a
certain
race,
you
have
certain
experience
that's
are
common.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
we're
saying
is
that
if
you
assume
that
because
you
are
white
or
you
are
red
or
you
are
brown
or
you
are
black,
you
must
have
certain
experiences
and
you
must
have
certain
viewpoints.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
but
justice
stevens--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
a
self-contradictory
rational
that
they've
come
up.
they
say
first
of
all
you
have
these
characteristics
because
you're
black
but
we
must
admit
enough
of
you
into
the
class
to
prove
to
the
other
students
that...
that
black
isn't
the
reason
you're--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
their
argument,
a,
takes
several
forms,
at
one
point
it's
that,
at
one
point,
it's
the
need
to
get
more
people
elite...
of
different
backgrounds,
it's
a...
but
what
this
court
has
said
that
racial
preferences,
racial
stereotyping,
which
it
is,
is
stigmatizing,
it's
divisive,
it's
damaging
to
the
fabric
of
society,
it's
damaging
to
the
goal
ultimately
to
eliminate
the
problems
that
racial
discrimination
and
racial
differences
have
created.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
submit,
justice
ginsburg
that
none
of
those
countries
has
our
history,
none
of
those
countries
has
the
fourteenth
amendment,
none
of
those
histories
has
the
history
of
the
statements
by
this
court
which
has
examined
the
question
over
and
over
again
that
the
ultimate
damage
that
is
done
by
racial
preferences
is
such
that
if
there
ever
is
a
situation
in
which
such
factors
must
be
used
that
they
must
be...
race
neutral
means
must
be
used
to
accomplish
those
objective,
narrow
tailoring
must
be
applied,
and
this...
this...
these
programs
fail
all
of
those
tests.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--sadly,
i
believe
that
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
let
me
conclude
by
saying
that
the
michigan
law
school
and
the
university
of
michigan
ultimately
must
make
a
choice.
it
may
maintain
its
elitist,
as
it
refers
to
it,
selection
process
without
regard
to
race,
or
it
may
achieve
the
racial
diversity
it
seeks
with
race
neutral
compromises
in
its
admission
standards.
but
the
one
thing
that
it
may
not
do
is
compromise
its
admission
standards
or
change
its
admission
requirements
for
one
race
and
not
another.
that
is
forbidden
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
may
well
be
justice
stevens.
we're
not
defending
the
specifics
of
those
programs,
but
we
have
not
examined
them
individually.
we...
we
believe
that
the
ultimate
solution
to
the
problem
that
race
has
created...
that
difference
in
race
has
created
in
this
country
has
got
to
be
according
to
what
this
court
has
said,
the
most
neutral
race...
neutral
means
possible.
