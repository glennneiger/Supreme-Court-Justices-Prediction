chief

william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
nothing,
i
take
it...
if
mr.
hamacher
prevails
on
the
transfer...
there
is
nothing
in
his
prevailing
that
would
hurt
any
other
class
member.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
a...
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how...
how
does
the
university
of
michigan
decide
those
things?
do
they...
is
it
just
a
self-reporting
type
of
system
on
the
application?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kolbo.
general
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
general
olson.
mr.
payton,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
half
of
the
ones
who
come
from
michigan
come
from
detroit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
payton,
what
is
a
meaningful
number?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
critical
mass?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
know
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
they...
professors
at
the
university
of
michigan
spend
a
lot
of
time
with
the
students?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
they
spend
a
lot
of
time
with
them
other
than
lecturing
to
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
they
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
payton,
in
your
brief,
you
say
the
volume
of
applications
and
the
presentation
of
applicant
information
may
get
impractical
for
lsa
to
use
admissions
system
as
the
much
smaller
university
of
michigan
law
school.
now,
you're
saying
that
every
single
application
for
admission
to
lsa
is
read
individually?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
underrepresented
minorities,
what
comparison
are
you
making
to
say
that
it's
underrepresented?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
the
federal
government
use
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
perhaps
i
could
get
a
more
direct
answer.
how
do
you
decide
whether,
say,
african
americans
or
hispanics
are
quote
underrepresented,
close
quote?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
compared
to
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--when
you
say
underrepresented,
it
sounds
like
something
almost
mathematical,
that
you're
saying,
we
only
have
a
certain
percentage
of...
and
we
should
have
this
percentage,
well,
what
is
this
percentage?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
a
sufficient
number?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
asked
you,
what
is
a
sufficient
number?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
an
answer...
would
you
answer
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
payton.
mr.
kolbo,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining...
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
kolbo.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
opinion
which
i
have
to
announce
is
in
the
case
of
02-516,
jennifer
gratz
versus
lee
bollinger.
jennifer
gratz
and
patrick
hamacher
both
applied
for
admission
to
the
university
of
michigan's
undergraduate
college
of
literature,
science,
and
arts,
unlike
the
law
school
case
which
justice
o'connor
just
announced.
both
were
denied
admission.
they
subsequently
filed
a
lawsuit
in
federal
district
court
alleging
that
the
university's
use
of
racial
preferences
in
undergraduate
admissions
violate
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
section
1981
of
title
42
of
u.s.
code.
the
district
court
certified
a
class
consisting
of
those
individuals
who
unsuccessfully
applied
for
admission
to
the
undergraduate
program
from
1995
forward,
and
who
are
members
of
those
groups
that
respondents
treated
less
favorably
on
the
basis
of
race
and
considering
their
applications
for
admission.
the
office
of
undergraduate
admissions
of
michigan
(oua)
oversees
the
lsa
admissions
process.
oua
considers
a
number
of
factors
in
making
admissions
decision
including
high
school
grade,
standardized
test
scores,
high
school
quality,
geography,
alumni
relationships,
and
leadership.
oua
also
considers
race.
the
university
considers
african-americans,
hispanics,
and
native
americans
to
be
underrepresented
minority.
the
university
has
changed
its
admission
program
several
times
during
the
course
of
this
litigation.
the
current
program
employs
a
selection
index
on
which
an
applicant
can
score
a
maximum
of
150
points.
this
index
is
divided
lineally
into
ranges
generally
calling
for
admission's
dispositions
based
on
an
applicants
calculated
score.
a
score
of
100
points
guarantees
admission.
each
applicant
receives
point
based
on
the
factors
considered
by
the
oua.
an
applicant
is
entitled
to
20
points
based
upon
membership
and
an
underrepresented
minority
group.
the
university
also
provides
an
additional
level
of
review
for
some
applications
and
that
counsellors
may
flag
an
application
for
committee
review
after
determining
that
the
applicant
has
met
certain
criteria.
the
committee
then
determines
whether
to
admit
these
applicants.
the
parties
filed
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
determined
that
the
current
admissions
program
is
a
narrowly
tailored
means
of
achieving
the
university's
asserted
interest
in
a
diverse
student
body.
the
court
also
found,
however,
that
the
admissions
prgram
used
from
1995
to
1998
operated
as
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
quota.
thus,
the
court
granted
petitioner's
motion
for
summary
judgment
with
respect
to
that
program
and
respondent's,
the
university's,
motion
as
to
the
current
program.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
heard
this
case
en
banc
along
with
grutter
against
bollinger,
the
law
school
case.
the
court
issued
an
opinion
in
grutter,
and
the
petitioner
in
that
case
sought
this
court's
review
which
it
has
obtained.
petitioner's
asked
this
court
to
grant
certiorari
in
this
case
is
well
despite
the
fact
that
the
sixth
circuit
had
not
yet
rendered
a
judgment.
we
did
so.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
the
michigan
undergraduate
admissions
program.
we
hold
that
hamacher
have
standing
to
seek
his
perspective
relief
with
respect
to
the
university's
continued
use
of
race
in
admission.
thus,
we
turn
to
the
merits
of
petitioner's
claim.
we
hold
that
the
university's
current
policy
which
distributes
20
points
to
every
underrepresented
minority
applicant
solely
because
of
race
is
not
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
respondents
asserted
interest
in
diversity.
in
the
bakke
case,
justice
powell
emphasized
the
importance
of
considering
each
particular
applicant
as
an
individual
assessing
all
of
the
qualities
that
individual
possesses
and
in
turn
evaluating
that
individual's
ability
to
contribute
to
the
unique
setting
of
higher
education.
the
admissions
program
he
described
did
not
contemplate
that
any
single
characteristic
automatically
insured
a
specific
and
identified
contribution
to
university's
diversity.
instead,
each
characteristic
of
an
applicant
was
to
be
considered
in
assessing
the
applicant's
entire
application.
the
current
lsa
policy
clearly
fails
to
provide
such
individualized
review.
the
only
consideration
that
a
company,
the
lsa,
the
mechanized
distribution
of
20
points
to
each
underrepresented
minority
applicant
is
a
determination
that
the
applicant
is
in
fact
a
member
of
such
a
group.
moreover,
unlike
justice
powell's
discussion
where
the
race
of
a
particular
black
applicant,
as
he
put
it,
could
be
considereed
wihtout
being
decisive,
tespondents
readily
conceived
that
this
automatic
distribution
makes
race
decisive
for
virtually
every
minimally
qualified
underrepresented
minority
applicant.
the
flagging
program
does
not
save
this
admissions
program.
this
review
is
the
exception
and
not
the
rule
in
the
operation
of
the
program
and
it
is
only
provided
after
the
university
automatically
distributes
points
that
make
race
the
decisive
factor.
finally,
we
reject
the
university's
argument
that
administrative
challenges
make
it
impractical
for
the
school
to
use
the
program
upheld
in
grutter.
that
a
program
capable
of
providing
individualized
consideration
might
presents
such
challenges
does
not
render
constitutional
and
otherwise
problematic
system
such
as
michigan.
