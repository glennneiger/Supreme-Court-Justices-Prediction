oh,
he
has
standing
to
challenge.
that's...
that
seems
clear,
but
the...
depending
on
the
rationale
that
the
court
adopts
if
it
finds...
if
it
finds
the
program
unacceptable,
he
may
not
be
entitled
to
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
wanted
race
to
be
considered
by
private
institutions
such
as
harvard
and
what-not,
if
there's
a
problem
with
1981,
or
any
of
the
other
federal
statutes,
they
can
simply
amend
it.
what
the...
the
only
thing
that
the
constitution
applies
to
is
state
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
all
the
rest
is
simply
congress'
decision
to
impose
a
similar
restriction
upon
private
actors,
which
decision
it
can
change
if
it
wishes.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
olson,
do
you
know
whether
any
of
those
countries
that
justice
ginsburg
referred
to
that
have
gone
down
the
road
of
racial
preferences,
racial
entitlements,
have
ever
gotten
rid
of
racial
preferences
or
racial
entitlements?
justice
antonin
scalia
has
it
been
the
road
ultimately
to
a
color
blind
society
or
has
it
been
the
road
to
a
society
that
has
percentage
entitlements
for
the
various
races?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
michigan
have,
as
some
schools
i
know
have,
schools
that
have
affirmative
action
program,
does
it
have
a
minority
dormitory?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
apart
from
being
excluded,
if...
it
is
in
fact
the
residential
pattern
quite
mixed
and
there
are
no
dormitories
that
are,
you
know,
just
as
sometimes
there
is...
there
is
the
jocks
dormitory,
there
is
really
no
african
american
dormitory?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
none
of
that
matters.
justice
antonin
scalia
none
of
that
matters
if
you're
minimally
qualified
and
you're
one
of
the
minority
races
that
gets
the
20
points,
you're
in,
correct?
the
rest
is
really
irrelevant?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
your
standards
are
so
high,
you
say
that
there
are
very
few
of
those
who
can
meet
your
standards.
so
why
don't
you
lower
your
standards,
i
mean
if
this
is
indeed
a
significant
compelling
state
interest,
why
don't
you
lower
your
standards?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
taking
race
into
account,
you
can
you
can
do
it.
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
just
lower
your
qualification
standards,
if...
if
this
value
of...
of
having
everybody
in
a
mix
with
people
of
other
races
is
so
significant
to
you,
just
lower
your
qualifications.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
be
the
great
college
you
are,
you
can
be
a
lessor
college
if
that
value
is
important
enough
to
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
anything
that
contradicts
that
mission
is
automatically
a
compelling
state
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
payton,
it's
easy
to
say
they
can
ignore
the
points.
it's
easy
to
say.
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
a
minority
applicant,
one
of
the
minorities
favored
in
your
program,
who
was
minimally
qualified,
got
the
20-point
favor
and
was
rejected?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
important,
i
mean,
to
say
theoretically,
it's
fine,
yes,
theoretically,
you
can
reject
it.
but
as
i
understand
what...
what
the
other
side
is
saying,
it
is
automatic,
if
you
are
minimally
qualified,
and
you
get
those
20
points,
you
are
in,
that's
what
they
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
do
you
assert
that
that
is
false?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
are
some
qualified
minorities
who
get
the
20
points
and
who
are
rejected?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
payton,
let
me
ask
justice
o'connor's
question,
when
does
all
of
this
come
to
an
end?
