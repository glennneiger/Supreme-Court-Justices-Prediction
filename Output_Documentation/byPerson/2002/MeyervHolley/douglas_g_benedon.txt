mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question...
excuse
me.
the
question
presented
should
be
answered
with
the
following
bright
line
rule:
imposition
of
vicarious
liability
under
the
fha
should
be
determined
by
application
of
established
rules
of
corporate
and
agency
law
not
criteria
unique
to
the
fha.
under
these
principles,
corporate
shareholders
and
officers
are
not
vicariously
liable
for
the
torts
of
the
other
agents
of
the
corporation.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
a
different
rule
should
apply
under
the
fha,
that
vicarious
liability
could
be
based
on
control
alone.
that
is
not,
nor
should
it
be,
the
law.
while
the
starting...
the
starting
point
for
the
analysis
is
necessarily
the
statute
itself,
while
congress
has
authority
to
expand
the
class
of
persons
liable
for
violation
of
a
federal
law,
when
it
has
done
so,
it
has
done
so
expressly.
the
fha
was
never...
which
neither
defines
nor
expands
the
class
of
persons
liable
under
the
act,
and
as
this
court
stated
in
bestfoods,
this
silence
is
dispositive.
specifically,
congress
has
spoken
directly
when
it
has
wished
to
impose
a
control
test.
for
example--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--the
answer--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
that's
where--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--my...
your
honor,
my
answer
to
that
is...
is
several-fold.
first,
the
distinction
needs
to
be
made
between
a
corporate
broker
and
an
individual
broker.
mr.
meyer
in
this
case
is
a
corporate
officer
who
holds
a
broker's
license
solely
as
the
officer
of
the
corporation.
the
corporation
is
the
employer
of
the
agent.
the
agent
operates
under
the
license
held
by
the
corporation.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
it
has
to,
your
honor.
a
corporation
as
a
paper
person
needs
human
beings
to
fulfill
the
function
that
a
corporation
must
do,
as
does
any
corporation.
there
will
always
be
supervising
officers--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--the
named
broker,
again...
to
answer
your
question,
no,
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
not
the
designated
officer,
your
honor.
the
corporation
has
been
held
liable.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
but
not
the
designated
officer/broker.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
absolutely,
your
honor.
there
are
separate
licenses
issued
by
the
department
of
real
estate
in
california:
one
to
individuals
who
act
as
brokers,
and
one
to
individuals
who
are
brokers
only
in
their
capacity
as
officers
of
a
corporation.
those
are
separate
licenses.
the
only
license
in
this
cases
was
held
by
mr.
meyer
as
an
officer
of
the
corporation.
he
could
not
step
outside
the
corporation
and
act
as
a
broker.
his
existence
as
a
broker
depended
on
the
corporation.
he
could
not
transact--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--yes,
it
has,
your
honor.
in
two
cases,
there
have
been,
one...
one
state
case
and
one
district
court
case
cited
in
our...
in
our
briefs,
in
the...
re
grabau
case.
they've
held
that
the
california
statutory
scheme
imposes
only
a
disciplinary
remedy
for
any
violations
of
the
scheme
such
that
a
broker...
a
designated
officer/broker
who
violates
any
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute
may
be
subject
to
discipline,
but
is
not
the
basis
of
a
civil
action.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
correct.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
the--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--the
other
facets
is
that
liability
under
the
fha
cannot
be
premised
on
california
agency
law.
there,
the...
the
agency
under
the
fha
is
determined
on
federal
rules
of
agency.
to
determine
federal
agency,
this
court
held
in
general
contractors,
you
look
to
the
restatement
which
has
a
two-prong
test.
one
is
the
right
of
control,
but
the
other
is
that
the
person
controlled
has
to
be
acting
on
behalf
of
the
principal.
here,
the
agent
works...
is
working
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
in
this
case
when
mr.
crank
went
out
and
did
real
estate
transactions,
he
was
acting
on
behalf
of
triad.
he
was
not
acting
on
behalf
of
meyer.
the
problem
with
looking
at
each
state's
structure
is
we're
going
to
end
up
with
a
patchwork
construction
of
a
federal
statute.
the
law
may
be
different
in
nevada
than
from
oregon
than
from
washington
than
from
west
virginia.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
again,
your
honor,
the--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--correct.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
to
answer
that
question,
i
think
you
still
need
to
make
a
distinction
between
individual
brokers
and
corporate
licensed
brokers.
we
do
not
dispute
that--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--again,
i...
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
the
rules
still...
you
need
to
still
look
at
the
federal
law
of
agency
rather
than
how
the
state
defines
the
relationship
between
the
broker
and
the
agent.
you...
again,
you
look
to
the
federal
rules
of
agency
to
determine
agency
under
the
fha.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
the
general
law
principles
applied
in
the
broker/agent
context
would
establish
that
the
agent...
the
sales
agent...
is
the
agent
of
the
principal
broker
when
the
broker
is
acting
in
his
individual
capacity
when
the
agent
is
acting
on
behalf
of
the
principal,
of
the
individual
broker,
and
subject
to
that
broker's
control.
the
situation
is
different
when
it's
a
officer/broker
who
is
not...
the
agent
in
that
situation
is
not
acting
on
behalf
of
the
officer.
he's
acting
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
to
date,
that
is
how
california
has
treated
violations
of
the
california
statutory
scheme.
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
excuse
me,
your
honor.
individual
brokers
as
well.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
it's
a
statutory
scheme
that
applies
to
brokers
in
general
and
salespersons
in
general
who...
who
allegedly
violate
the
act.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
if
it's
an
individual
broker's
license.
i
think
i
may
have
caused
some
confusion.
under
general
principles
of
agency
law,
common
law
principles
of
agency
law,
the
sales
agent
is
in
an
agent
principal
relationship
with
an
individual
broker.
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
act
by
the
broker
under
california
law,
then
he
would
be
subject
to
disciplinary
action.
that
is
separate
and
apart
from
vicarious
liability
under
the
fha,
which
would
adhere
based
on
the
principal
agent
relationship.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
we
hold
that
the
theory
and
doctrine
of
corporate
veil-piercing
is...
is
available
in
the
appropriate
case
as
it
would
be
under
any
case
under
the
general
common
law,
although
here
it's
been...
it
wasn't
raised
and
it's
been
waived,
and
it's
never
been
proven.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
on
the
last
page
of
argument
in
a
footnote,
your
honor,
there's
a
reference
arguing
that
based
on
sole
ownership,
that
they
could
establish
an
alter
ego,
but
as
a
matter
of
law,
that's
insufficient
to
establish
alter
ego.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
first
a
motion
to
dismiss,
your
honor--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--followed
by
a--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--the
motion
for
dismiss
was
granted
in
part,
your
honor,
as
to
all
the
state
law
claims--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--the
1981
claim,
and
it
proceeded
just
on
the
fha
claim.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
absolutely.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
nothing,
except
sole
ownership.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
which
is
in
dispute.
we
maintain
that
ownership
was,
in
fact,
transferred,
but
we
are
assuming
for
the
purpose
of
this
proceeding
that
there
is
in
fact
ownership
resided
in
mr.
meyer.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
they...
the
theory
was
never
raised
below.
an
alter
ego
is
in
and
of
itself
a
fact-driven
inquiry.
where
it's...
and
so
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
raised
below,
it's...
it's
now
been
waived.
it
can't
be
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
that's
correct.
that
is
correct
and
that
is
our
position.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
no.
you...
i
would
like
to
amplify
on
that,
your
honor.
the
issue
of...
of
alter
ego
that's
been
now
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this...
in
this
court
by
the
solicitor
general
is
based
on
speculation
beyond
the
showing
that
there
was
sole
ownership
and
that
there
is
no
insurance
coverage.
everything
else
is
unsupported
by
the
record
in
terms
of
establishing
that
there
was
a
failure
to
adhere
to
corporate
formalities,
that
there
was
under-capitalization.
all
that
is
speculation.
and
the
argument
boils
down--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--no.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
no,
it
wasn't--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--it
was
not
even
asserted.
it's
asserted
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
they
mention
sole
ownership
in
the
footnote.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
yes.
and
for
example,
the...
your...
your
honor
made
reference
to
payment
of
taxes.
while
that
was
alleged,
it
was
never
proven
at
the
summary
judgment
stage.
that's
just
an
allegation
in
their--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--right.
there's--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--that
he...
that
taxes
were
paid
under
his
id?
none
whatsoever.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
on
the
other
side
claiming
that?
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
it
was
raised
solely
as
a...
as
an
allegation
in
the
complaint.
and
then
when
it
came
time
for
them
to
put
their
proof
on
the
table,
it
wasn't
there.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
correct.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
absolutely.
but
again,
it
was
not
raised
as
a
disputed
material
fact
on
the
summary
judgment,
so
there's
no
formal
denial
in
the
record
because
it
was
never
raised.
i'm
denying
it
now.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
that
there
was
no
issue
regarding
payment
of
taxes
under
mr.
meyer's
personal
id
number.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
right.
the
only
issue
on
the
summary
judgment
was
whether
or
not
mr.
meyer
was
still
the
owner
of
triad
corporation.
the
district
court
found
not.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
a
disputed
issue
on
sole
ownership.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
they're
claiming
that
that
was
sufficient
to
establish
alter
ego,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
well,
i'm
using
those
interchangeably.
i
apologize.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
i
use
those
interchangeably.
they...
both
alter
ego
as
a
basis
for
piercing
the
corporate
veil.
they
were
arguing...
and
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
held...
that
sole
ownership
of
the
corporation
was
enough
to
pierce
the
corporate
veil.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
no.
they...
solely
based
on
sole
ownership.
correct.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
based--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--right.
well,
that...
that's
the
argument
that's
made
in
their
footnote
on
the
last
page
of
their
brief
is
that
sole
ownership
would
establish
an
alter
ego
sufficient
to
pierce
the
corporate
veil.
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
that's...
that
is
insufficient.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
yes,
there
was.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
they
were
trying
to...
no,
i
disagree.
i
think
what
they
were
trying
to
establish
in
the
district
court
was
the...
the
control
exerted
by
my
client
over
the
corporation
as
opposed
to
saying
that
he
should
be
necessarily
a
veil-piercing--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--he
got
some
of
the
stock,
but
ownership--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--he
would
have
partial
control
as
a...
as
a
shareholder.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
but
the...
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
that
was
enough.
the
court...
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--it
was
enough
to
impose
personal
liability.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
no.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
solely
on
sole
ownership.
they...
the
ninth
circuit,
taking
a...
its
lead
from,
i
believe,
the
seventh
circuit,
said
basically
that
in
a
situation
like
this
where
you
have
sole
ownership,
under
the
fha
that's
enough
to
impose--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--correct.
it's...
it's
an
almost
per
se
piercing
based
on
sole
ownership.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
again,
i...
i
don't
have
the
facts
of
that
case
at...
at
the
tip
of
my
fingers.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
right.
but
again,
in
that
case
i
don't
recall
if
it
was
a
corporate
broker
or
whether
it
was
an
individual
broker.
but
if
it
was
a
corporate
broker
and
they're
holding
them
individually
liable
for
the
torts
of
the--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
it's
been
argued
by
both
sides
and
the
case
law
is
consistent
that
it's
federal
rules
of
agency.
and
under
federal
rules
of
agency,
the
salesperson
is
the
agent
of
the
corporation,
not
the
individual
broker.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
just
like
to
conclude
and
save
the
rest...
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
your
honors,
i
would
submit
at
this
point
unless
there
are
any
further
questions.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
i
would
start
from
the
premise
that
the
veil-piercing
theory
was
never
born,
not
that
it
wasn't
alive.
okay?
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
never
contained
in
the
complaint,
never
raised--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--but
again,
we
have
to
look
at
what
are
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
there--
mr.
douglas
g.
benedon
--there
are
allegations
of
sole
ownership,
corporate...
that
he
was
the
sole
owner,
that
he
was
the
officer/broker,
and
that
he
was
the
president,
and
that
the
taxes
were
paid
under
his
id
number,
an
allegation
that's
never
been
proven.
i
think
most
telling
to
what
was
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit
itself,
and
that's
at
page
67
of
the
joint
appendix
where
the
court
of
appeals
states
where
common
ownership
and
management
exists,
corporate
formalities
must
not
be
rigidly
adhered
to,
a
holding
which
is
clearly
erroneous,
but
which
sets
out
what
was
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
was
not
under-capitalization.
the
issue
was
not
mismanagement
of
corporate
formalities.
the
issue
is...
was
could
mr.
meyer
as
an
individual
be
held
liable
because
he
was
the
sole
owner,
president,
and
designated
broker
of
triad...
triad
realty.
excuse
me.
and
for
that
reason,
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
reversed
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
favor
of
mr.
meyer
reinstated
in
full.
