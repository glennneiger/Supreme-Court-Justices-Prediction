--was
there
some
reference
to
veil-piercing
in
the
respondents'
brief
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
we
look
to
general
federal
common
law
agency
principles,
or
are
we
bound
by
state
agency
law,
mr.
stewart?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
it's
fair
to
read
the
complaint
that
was
filed
as
putting
anyone
on
notice
that
it
was
a
veil-piercing
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
you
read
it
to
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
it's
not
clear
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
think
if
i
read
that
complaint,
i
would
read
it
as
one
that
was
proceeding
on
a
veil-piercing
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
it
was
proceeding
on
the
designated
broker
theory.
