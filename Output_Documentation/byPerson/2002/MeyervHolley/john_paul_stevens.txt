justice
john
paul
stevens
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
number
01-1120,
meyer
against
holley.
mr.
benedon.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
you
explained
to
justice
scalia
that
there
is
no
california
case
holding
a
corporate
broker
liable
in
this
situation,
as
i
understand.
are
there
any
california
cases
going
the
other
way?
has
it
ever...
has
the
issue
ever
been
presented
to
the
california
courts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
this
case
the
individual
could
be
subject
to
discipline,
but
not
to
liability.
is
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
was
the
relevance
of
whether
he
was
the
owner
or
not?
i
don't
quite
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
alter
ego,
but
not
piercing
the
corporate
veil,
is
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
were
arguing
that.
so
they
were
arguing
the
pierce-corporate-veil
theory
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the...
but
the
purpose
of
investigating
the
sole
ownership
issue
was
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
could
pierce
the
corporate
veil.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
seems
to
me
as
though
their
issue
of
whether
they
could
pierce
the
corporate
veil
was
at
least
raised,
and
the
question
is
whether
their
claim
of
sole
ownership
was
sufficient
to
establish
that
point.
maybe
i'm
misunderstanding
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
now
i'm
just
a
little
puzzled
about
the
extent
to
which
it
was
raised
in
the
district
court.
was
there
a
debate
on
the...
in
the
district
court
as
to
whether
your
client
was
the
sole
owner
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
was
the
purpose
of
that
debate
in
the
district
court?
wasn't
it
for
the
very
same
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
i...
i
don't
remember
the
facts
correctly.
but
i
thought
that
control
was
really
not
in
dispute.
i
thought
that
the...
the
person
to
whom
he
transferred
stock
didn't
get
all
the
stock,
did
he,
or
did
he
get
just
some
of
the
stock?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
still
would
have
had
control.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
very
well.
mr.
schwemm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schwemm,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
we
really
didn't
grant
certiorari
to
decide--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
california
question
as
esoteric
as
this
one
is.
and
i'm
just
wondering,
do
you
defend
the
rationale
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
do
you
defend
the...
do
you
abandon
reliance
on
any
federal
defense
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
federal
regulation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
is
your
piercing-of-corporate-veil
theory
a
federal
theory
or
a
state
law
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your
opponent
says
that
the...
the
results
under
california
law
is
he
can
be
disciplined
if
he
fails
to
do
so,
but
there
are
no
california
cases
holding
him
personally
liable
if
he
fails
to
do
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it's
right
or
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
schwemm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stewart.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
benedon,
you
have
7
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--oh,
excuse
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
benedon.
the
case
is
submitted.
