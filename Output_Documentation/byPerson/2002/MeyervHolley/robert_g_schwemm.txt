mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
veil-piercing
and
the
preserving
issue,
particularly
with
respect
to
justice
scalia's
question
because
i
disagree
with
my
learned
friend
on
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case.
there
was
a
12(b)(6)
motion
to
dismiss.
in
the
complaint
at
that
time,
there
were
essentially
two
theories.
the
complaint
said
that
mr.
meyer
should
be
liable
as
an
individual
because
he
owned
the
corporation,
and
the
complaint
also
said
that
mr.
meyer
should
be
liable
because
he
was
the
officer/broker.
the
district
court
granted
in
part,
even
with
respect
to
the
fair
housing
act
claim,
the
12(b)(6)
motion
and,
in
particular,
held
that
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
with
respect
to
ownership
under
no
circumstances
could
lead
to
liability.
and
the
only
thing
that
the
district
court
did
not
grant
12(b)(6)
on
was
the
issue
with
respect
to
liability
based
on
officer/broker.
that
led
to
discovery.
the
district
court
then
granted
summary
judgment
because
it
was
the
district
court's
theory
on
that
issue
that
there
could
not
be
liability
unless
mr.
meyer
held
an
individual
broker's
license
as
opposed
to
what
he
holds
in
this
case,
which
is
a
license
through
triad,
or
more
properly,
according
to
the
california
law,
triad
holds
the
license
through
him.
so
with
all
respect,
what
the
district
court
held
in
the
12(b)(6)
motion
was
that
no
set
of
facts
that
the
plaintiffs
could
prove
could
justify
veil-piercing.
we
never
got--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--and
the
facts
that
we
alleged
were
that
mr.
meyer
was
the
sole
owner
of
the
corporation,
which
they
denied,
and
that
that
was
sufficient
to
impose
individual
liability.
and
when
the
district
court
granted
12(b)(6)
motion,
my
understanding
of
that
is
that
he
is
saying,
under
no
set
of
facts
will
you
ever
win.
now,
what
would--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--absolutely.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
that's...
that
was
my
point--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--with
respect
to
the
summary
judgment.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
i
don't
think
so
because--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--at
the
12(b)(6)
motion
stage,
we
are
told
that
you
can't
even--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--yes.
if
my
learned
friend
was
right
that
this
was
a
summary
judgment
dismissal
of
that
claim,
i
might
agree.
but
that's
not
right.
we
were
stopped
at
the
very
pleadings
stage.
we
were
prepared
to
show
both
of
the
key
factors
with
respect
to
veil-piercing,
which
is
that
the
corporation
is
heavily
underfunded.
in
fact,
in
a
colloquy
with
the
district
court,
the
defendant's
counsel,
after
the
12(b)(6)
motion,
your
honor,
when
the
only
thing
left
was
the
summary
judgment
with
respect
to
the
broker
situation,
the
district
court
said,
is
there
any
money
in
the
company?
and
the
defendant's
lawyer
said,
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
correct,
your
honor.
the...
the
phrase
veil-piercing
is
not
mentioned--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--the
allegation,
if
i
could
refer
your
honor
to
page
4
of
the
joint
appendix
in
paragraph
6
of
the
complaint,
says
that
he
owned
the
corporation
and
on
that
basis
he's
individually
liable.
and
then
it
goes
on
and
says
he
also
was
the
officer/broker
of
the
corporation,
which
is
the
other
theory--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--there
is
another
part,
your
honor.
page
7
of
the
joint
appendix,
paragraph
13,
which
carries
over
to
page
8.
essentially
the
same
thing.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
is
additional
material
there,
but
there
is
the
allegation
of
ownership
leading
to
personal
liability.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
well,
i
wish
it
was
more
detailed,
your
honor,
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
sufficient
for
notice
pleading.
the
district
court
understood
it.
the
defendants
understood
it.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
and
that's
at
the
12(b)(6)
stage.
and...
and
my
understanding
of
that
is
he
is
saying,
i'm
not
going
to
get
you...
let
you
go
forward
to
your
proof
because
under
no
circumstances
can
there
be
veil-piercing
under
the
fair
housing
act,
which
is
just
wrong.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
no,
sir.
on
page
32,
which
is
the
district
court's
order,
page
32
to
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
the
district
court's
order--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--yes,
your
honor.
it
actually
starts
as
an
opinion
on
page
25
of
the
joint
appendix.
this
is
the
district
court's
order
granting
in
part
the
12(b)(6)
motion.
he
doesn't
allow
going
forward
at
the
12(b)(6)
stage
the
claim
based
on
ownership.
he
allows
going
forward
the
claim
based
on
corporate
broker,
and
he
specifically
refers
to
a
case...
this
is
the
12(b)(6)
decision...
that
talks
about
veil-piercing.
page
32
of
the
joint
appendix
in
the
footnote.
now,
our
point
is
that
that's
enough
for
notice
pleading.
the
defendants
understood
what
was
going
on.
the
judge
understood
what
was
going
on.
we
were
prepared...
certainly
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
justice
scalia,
we
would...
we
would
have
been
happy
to
go
forward
with
proof
of
underfunding,
and
there
is
substantial
proof
of
underfunding.
we
would
have
been
happy
to
go
forward
with
proof
of
lack
of
corporate
formalities.
this
is
a
company--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--that
we
did
allege.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
page
7
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor,
paragraph
13
toward
the
bottom
of
the
page.
after
it's
been
alleged
that
triad
was
owned
by
mr.
meyer--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--got
it?
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
we...
we
did
not
allege
the
details
of
that.
that
is
to
say,
we
did
not
allege
underfunding,
and
we
did
not
allege
lack
of
corporate
formalities.
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
not
required
under
conley
versus
gibson.
there
is
notice
pleading,
and
then
we
are
put
to
our
proof
if
that
had
been
permitted
to
go
forward
to
the
summary
judgment
stage.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
and
it
seems
to
me
in
a
case
decided
by
this
court
in
the
mid-'90s...
i
believe
it
was
peacock...
the
court
said
veil-piercing
is
really
not
a
new
claim.
it
is
a
theory
of
relief.
we
have
claimed
fair
housing
act
liability
in
the
complaint
based
on
these--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--yes.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
our
position--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--is
that
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
was
correct,
but
it
went
too
far
when
it
reached
out
and
said
under
the
fair
housing
act
we
have
to
go
beyond
traditional
principles
of
agency.
we
think
the
standard
should
be,
just
as
it
is
under
title
vii,
the
employment
discrimination
law,
in
kolstad,
burlington
industries,
and
faragher,
that
the
standard
for
vicarious
liability
under
the
federal
statute
should
be
a
federal
standard.
and
that
standard
should
be
traditional
agency
principles
as
informed
by
the
policies
of
the
fair
housing
act.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
apparently
felt
that
they
had
to
go
beyond
traditional
agency
principles.
what
we've
tried
to
do
in
the
brief
in
roman
numerals
i,
ii,
and
iii
is
point
out
three
separate
and
independent
alternative
theories
under
traditional
agency
principles.
and
in
that
sense,
we...
we
think
the
ninth
circuit
just
reached
out
and
tried
to
do
something
that
wasn't
necessary.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
our
position
on
that
is
that
it's
probably
federal
law,
but
as
i
read
bestfoods,
the
court
hasn't
specifically
determined,
and
if
i
may
say
that
this...
this
is
something
that
i
don't
have
a
position
on.
but
either
way,
we
are
entitled
to
a
remand
whether
it's
federal
or
california
law.
but
the
cause
of
action
clearly
is
the
fair
housing
act.
i
believe
the
government
takes
the
position...
and
we
certainly
don't
disagree
with
the
government...
that
it
is
a
federal
question.
and
if
i
may,
i
want
to
get
into
those
parts
i,
ii,
and
iii
of
our
brief,
and
particularly
the
first
part
and
vicarious
liability.
the
problem
we
have
with
petitioner's
argument
is
that
i
believe
it's
based
on
two
faulty
assumptions.
one
is
that
petitioner
wants
to
take
certain
parts
of
the
california
corporation
and
real
estate
law
that
are
advantageous
to
him,
but
he
doesn't
want
to
take
the
other
part,
which
is
the
responsibility
part.
it
is
literally
true
that
in
california,
a
corporation
can
be
a
broker,
but
it
cannot
be
a
broker
unless
there
is
an
individual
appointed
who
is
an
officer
of
the
corporation
and
has
qualified
under
the
broker
requirements,
and
that
individual
is
required
by
california
law
to
take
responsibility
for
the
supervision
and
control
of
the
agency.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
our
position
is
that
that
may
be
right,
it
may
be
wrong.
we
believe
this
is
a
federal
standard.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
if
we
got
a
remand,
your
honor,
we
would
very
much
like
the
opportunity
on
this
basis
to
argue
that
it's
wrong.
there
is
a
california
case
in
1978
that
holds
that,
but
a
year
later,
california
amends
its
licensing
statute
to
add
the
very
key
provision
in
this
case
which
is
10159.2
which
says
that
the
individual
who's
appointed
by
the
corporation
as
the
officer/broker
has
personal
responsibility.
so
our
argument
would
be
on
remand
that
that
change.
but
i
want
to...
i
want
to
make
the
point
that--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--well--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--i
would
put
it
actually
a
little
differently.
if
you
divide
the
corporation
from
mr.
meyer,
mr.
meyer
can
then
apply,
because
he's
qualified,
to
become
a
broker.
currently
he
would
have
to
file
a
paper,
but
he
would
clearly
get
the
status.
but
triad,
inc.
would
cease
at
that
moment
being
able
to
be
a
broker.
and
none
of
the
acts
in
this
case,
none
of
the
salesman's
acts,
could
have
been
performed
under
the
rubric
of
triad.
and
the
other
point
that
i
was
going
to
make
about
the
petitioner's
argument
that
i
think
is
faulty
is
it's
the
assumption
that
if
triad,
inc.
is
the
principal
of
these
agents,
nobody
else
can
be
the
principal
of
these
agents.
and
that's
clearly
inconsistent
with
longstanding
agency
principles
as
reflected
in
the
restatement,
section
20,
comment
f,
which
says
there
can
be
joint
principals.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
ordinarily,
your
honor,
but
not
in
this
case.
i...
i
repeat.
this
company
cannot
be
a
broker
if
it
doesn't
have
a
broker-qualified
individual
who
takes
responsibility
for
the
agents.
and
so--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not
on
all
fours.
i
believe
what
it
says
is
if
the
broker
is
operating
as
a
sole
proprietorship,
as
an
individual,
he
clearly
is
vicariously
liable.
that
is,
by
the
way,
what
86
percent
of
the
brokers
in
california
do.
they
operate
as
sole
proprietors,
and
they
are
clearly
vicariously
liable.
there
is
a...
an
additional
question.
what
happens
when
you
incorporate?
and...
and
so
it's
not
exactly
on
all
fours.
and
i
think
the...
the
jury
is
out
or
the
judges
are
out
with...
with
respect
to
what
california
would
do.
some
states
say
in
addition
to
the
corporation,
the
individual
is
vicariously
liable;
some
don't.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
there
are
many
uses,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like
to
address
that.
the
only
thing
that
we
are
arguing
that
mr.
meyer
was
responsible
for
is
what
i
would
call
the
licensed
activities.
for
example,
if
a
broker
went
out
on
the
way
to
a
meeting
and
negligently
drove
his
car
and
caused
an
accident,
that
is
not
the
kind
of
behavior
that's
subject
to
broker
supervision.
and
that
would
be
no
liability.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
only
i'm
not
saying
it,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
yes.
and
every
state...
i
want
to
make
this
point.
every
single
state
says
this.
11
states
say
you
can't
even
operate
as
a
broker
as
a
corporate
form.
39
states,
including
california,
said
we
will
allow
you
to
do
this,
but
there
has
to
be
one
human
being
that
is
responsible.
and
in
this
particular
case,
there
came
a
point
when
mr.
meyer
was
trying
to
get
the
triad
license
extended.
california
said
you
haven't
satisfied
that
because
you
personally,
meyer,
haven't
engaged
in
the
continuing
education
requirements
that
an
officer/broker
is
required--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--it's
very
analogous
to
lawyers,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
let
me--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--well,
it
held
that
and
then
california's
legislature
came
along
and
added...
added
the
requirements.
but
let
me...
let
me
make
this
observation:
when
mr.
crank,
the
salesperson
in
this
case,
wanted
to
extend
his
salesperson's
license,
he
was
required
to
have
his
broker
authorize
the
forms.
this
was
done
four
times
by
mr.
meyer.
if
you
look
at
the
form...
joint
appendix
lodging
75
is
the
most
recent
example,
but
there
are
three
other
examples...
the
california
form
says,
list
the
company.
triad.
and
then
requires
the
officer/broker,
meyer
in
this
case,
to
sign
a
certification
which
specifically
says,
i
certify
this
salesperson
is
employed
by
me.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
i'm
sorry.
i...
i
misspoke.
joint
appendix
lodging,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
it's
the
large
tan
one.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
and
this
was
done,
by
the
way,
for
mr.
crank
on
four
different
occasions.
what
i'm
trying
to...
to
say
is
this
is
a
classic
case
of
joint
principal.
there
aren't...
that
isn't
true,
justice
scalia,
in...
in
every
corporate
situation.
of
course,
not.
we
don't
argue
that.
we
argue
that
this
is
a
responsible
human
being
and
that
that
makes
him
liable--
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
--that
would
be
my
response
as
well.
we
have
a...
a
federal
standard
informed
by
state
law.
mr.
robert
g.
schwemm
thank
you.
