justice
anthony
m.

suppose...
suppose
that
i
were
to
agree
with
you
and
the
court
were
to
agree
with
you
as
to
your
criticism
of
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
and...
and
that
it
agreed
with
you
too
that
general
principles
of
agency
and
corporate
liability
apply.
based
on
this
record,
could
we
go
on
to
say
that
under
california
law
and
real
estate
law
generally,
the
real
estate
salesman
is
the
agent
of
the
broker,
and
therefore
the
broker
is
liable
under
agency
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or...
or
would
i
have
to...
would
we
have
to
remand
before
we
did
that?
because
this
is
discussed
in
the...
in
the
respondents'
brief,
and
the
respondent
makes
it
quite
clear.
and
maybe
you
disagree,
but
the...
the
law
is
cited
on
page
15
of
the
red
brief,
that
under
california
law,
the
broker
is
the
principal.
and
i
take
it
the
principal
would
be
liable
under
respondeat
superior
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
if
we
find
who
the
principal
is,
we
know
the
principal
is
going
to
be
liable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
california
law
the
broker
is
the
principal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that...
or
isn't
it?
maybe
you'll
take
issue
with
this,
that
the
corporation
operates
as
a
broker
only
because
it
has
the
individual's
broker
license
assigned
to
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
is
there
any
california
law
saying
that...
that
the
corporation
is
the
principal
in
a
situation
like
this
and
not
the
holder
of
the...
not
the...
not
the
named
broker?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this...
this
is
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
it
were
the
majority
rule
that
a
real
estate
broker
is
the
principal
for
the
salesman.
would
we
follow
that
rule
generally?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
again,
i'm...
i'm
referring
to
the
red
brief
at
pages
14
and
15
which
sets
this...
this
out.
you
say
there's
a
distinction
because
there's
a
corporate
broker
and...
and
an
individual
broker.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
we...
i...
we
can
explore
that
a
little
bit.
but
suppose
it
were
the...
the
general
rule
in
most
of
the
states
that
had
addressed
the
subject
that
the
broker
is
the
principal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
was
simply
addressing
the
point
of
whether
or
not
state
law
as
opposed
to
federal
law
controls.
and
if
it's
the
general
law
in
most
states
that
the
broker
is
the
principal,
then
that
would
certainly
be
sufficient
for
the
imposition
of
liability
under
this
federal
scheme.
would
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
just
returning
one...
once
again
to
the
broker
problem.
i'm
looking
at
gipson
versus
davis
realty,
which
is
a
case
by
judge...
written
by
judge
molinari.
it's
cited
on
page
15
of
the
respondents'
brief.
that
was
a
standard
respondeat
superior
case
where
the
broker...
pardon
me...
where
the
salesman
is
in
an
automobile
accident
and
they
seek
to
hold
the
principal
for
the
damages
caused
by
the
accident
within
the
course
of
his
employment.
and
this
is
the
case
where
the
statement
is
made
that
the
broker
is
liable
for
the
misconduct
or...
or
malfeasance
of...
of
the
agent
in
the
course
of...
of
his
employment.
and
it's
a
case
much
like
this
where
there's
a
corporation
that
holds
the
license.
there...
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
a...
a
distinction
between
the
corporate
license
and...
and
the
broker
license
that
you
made.
is
that...
was
the
law
changed
since
the
gipson
case,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
it
was
relied
on
in
the
respondents'
brief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
i
understand
the
facts
of
the
case,
it
was
an
individual
who
held
the
license
and
he
operated
through
a
corporation.
that's...
that's--
--well,
again,
i
would
say
that
what
california
decides
to
do
is
not
what
needs...
can
be
what
determines
under
the...
the
federal
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
the
gipson
case
that
you
cited
in
your
brief
is
on
all
fours
with
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
would
be
consistent
with
a
corporation
that's
wholly
adequately
funded
and...
and
whose...
which...
whose
veil
cannot
be
pierced.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't...
you
don't
rely
in
your
submission
on
the
proposition
that
under
california
law,
the
broker
is
liable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
because
you
accept
the
distinction
between
a
corporate
broker...
a
broker's
license
which
is
in
the
corporation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
in
a
majority
of
the
states,
the
broker
is
liable
for
the...
i
forget
the...
intervening
corporate...
suppose
in
a
majority
of
the
states,
the
broker
is
liable
for
the
acts
of
the
salesperson.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
