justice
antonin
scalia
--let
me
ask
the
opposite.
is
there
any
california
case
in
which
the
named
broker
in
the
corporation
has
been
held
liable
as
the
principal
solely
because
he's
the
named
broker?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
were
your
other
reasons.
you
said
you...
you
had
a
multi-faceted
answer,
or
something
like
that.
what...
what
are
the
other--
justice
antonin
scalia
--prongs
or
the
other
facets
of
your
answer?
justice
antonin
scalia
only...
only
by
these
corporate
brokers
or...
or
by...
by
individual
brokers?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
didn't...
refresh
my
recollection.
doesn't
this
come
up
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
was
denied
and
then
there
was
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
now,
so
if
it
came
up
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
then
whatever...
whatever
evidence
the
plaintiffs
were
going
to
rely
on
for
the
veil-piercing
would
have
had
to
have
been
brought
forward.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
did
they
bring
forward?
justice
antonin
scalia
sole
ownership
is
the
only
thing--
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if...
even
if
it
had
been
raised,
my
understanding
is
in...
in
order
to
have
it
sent
back
on
the...
on
the
basis
that
although
the
court
below
relied
on
one
theory,
it
could
have
relied
on
the
other,
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
put
the
plaintiff
to
his
proof
to...
to
at
least
come
up
with
facts,
the
assertion
of
facts,
not
the
demonstration
of
them,
but
the
assertion
of
facts
that
would
support
the
other
theory.
and
the
only
fact
contained
here
is
control.
so
if
control
is...
does
not
suffice
to
pierce
veils,
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
not
even
asserted?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
survive
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
you
don't
have
to
prove
it,
but
you
have
to
say
i...
you
know,
i
will
prove
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
even
asserted.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
while
it
was
alleged,
it
was
never
proven
at
the
summary
judgment
stage.
justice
antonin
scalia
there...
there
was
no
evidence
brought
in
at
all
to
establish
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
not...
not
that
it
was
enough
for
piercing
the
veil,
but
that
it
was
enough
for
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
what
basis?
not
on
veil-piercing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
you
don't
have
to
pierce
the
veil.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
could
prove
or...
or
claimed
they
could
prove
in
response
to
the
motion.
i
mean,
you...
you
don't
have
to
sit
back
and
say,
i
wonder
what
they
might
be
able
to
prove.
you...
you
have
to
have
made
an
offer
of
proof,
and...
and
what
the
court
held
was
that
none
of
the
facts
that
you
claimed
you
could
prove
would
suffice.
isn't
that
an
accurate
description
of...
of
what...
what
the
holding
of
the
court
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
was
at
the
summary
judgment
stage?
justice
antonin
scalia
32
of
the
joint
appendix.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
can...
can
i
go
back
to
an
earlier
point
you
made.
you
said
that
california
law
says
that
the
corporate
broker,
the...
the
one
who's
designated
for
the
corporation,
has
to
exercise
control
over
the...
over
the
brokers
in
the
corporation.
that
may
well
be
true.
the...
the
issue
is
not
whether
he...
he
has
to
exercise
control.
it's
whether
he
exercises
control
in
his
personal
status
or
rather
exercises
control
as
an
officer
of
the
corporation.
if
it's
in
the
latter
capacity
that
he
exercises
control,
he...
he
should
not
have
personal
liability.
it's
the
corporation
that
has
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
as
i
understand
the
california
law,
this
broker
could
not
operate
under
that
license
on
his
own.
the
only
way
he
could
use
that
license
was
as
an
officer
of
the
corporation.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
yes,
but...
sure,
of
course,
there
can.
but...
but
it's...
it's
corporation
law
that...
that
the
officers
of
the
corporation
are
not
one
of
those
other
principals.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
that
means
you
can't
have
a
corporation.
if...
if
you
want
to
run
a
real
estate
corporation,
you
can't
do
it
because
there
has
to
be
a
broker's
license,
and
you're
going
to
be
personally
liable.
what's
the
use
of
having
a
corporation
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
if
he
defrauds
a
client
or,
i
mean,
anything
that's
going
to
involve
big
money
on
the
part
of
the
corporation
is
going
to
come
back
on
the
head
of
the
individual
broker.
so
you're
saying
if
you
want
to
be
in
the
brokerage
business,
you
cannot
do
it
as
a
practical
matter
in
the
corporate
form.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
well,
no.
that...
that's
what
you
say
the
california
law
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
even
tougher
than...
than
what
most
states
provide
for
lawyers.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it
isn't
analogous
at
all.
lawyers...
lawyers
can...
can
avoid
personal
liability.
california
doesn't
give
personal
liability
there,
does
it?
i
mean,
my
statute
here
says
there's
an
officer
who's
designated
by
a
corporate
broker
license,
and
that
officer
is
responsible
for
supervision
and
control
of
activities
conducted
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
so
that
suggests
that
he's
conducting
that
supervision
on
behalf
of
the
corporation,
and
so
it's
the
corporation
that
would
respond
in...
in...
under
the
principle
of
respondeat
superior.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
only
have
74
pages
in
my
joint
appendix.
you
said
it
was
joint--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
got
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stewart,
as...
as
i
understand
the
theory
of
why
the
failure
to
bring
forward
affidavits
or
some...
some
evidentiary
proof
of
these
matters
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
was
not
necessary,
as
i
understand
it,
the
plaintiffs'
theory
is
it
wasn't
necessary
because
the
piercing-the-veil
portion
of
the
complaint
never
made
it
to
the
summary
judgment
stage.
it
had
been
dismissed
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
is
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
was
there
an
appeal
of
that
dismissal
on
the
face
of
the
complaint?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
portion?
was...
it
was
an
appeal
of
the...
of
the
portion
of
the
complaint
that
dismissed...
dismissed
a...
a
veil-piercing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
so
in
addition
to
the
complaint
being
very
vague,
the...
the
appeal
of
the
dismissal
was
pretty
vague
too.
i...
i
don't
understand
what...
i
mean,
if
you
were
objecting
to
the
dismissal
of
the...
of...
of
a
veil-piercing
theory,
you...
you
should
have,
it
seems
to
me,
come
forward
and
say,
i
object
to
dismissal
of
that
theory.
justice
antonin
scalia
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
do
have...
i'm
still...
what
is...
what
is
your
response
to
the...
to
the
assertion
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
plaintiffs
to
bring
forward
any
affidavits
or
evidence
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
because
on
the...
on
the
veil-piercing
issue...
because
that
issue
was
no
longer
alive
at
the...
at
the
summary
judgment
stage.
it
had
been
dismissed
on
the
complaint.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
you...
you
concede
that
then
and...
and
you...
you
fall
back
on...
on
the
simple
fact
that
the
veil-piercing
theory
was
never...
was
never
really
contained
in
the
complaint.
