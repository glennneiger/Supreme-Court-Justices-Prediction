mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
this
case
has
been
briefed
in
this
court,
it's
common
ground
among
the
parties
and
the
united
states
that
questions
of
vicarious
liability
under
the
fair
housing
act
are
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
generally
applicable
principles
of
agency
and
corporate
law
rather
than
by
reference
to
a
rule
that's
distinct
to
the
fha.
and
obviously,
it
is
a...
an
important
general
principle
of
corporate
law.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
court...
i'm
sorry.
i
think
the
task
for
the
court
would
to...
be
to
devise
a
uniform
nationwide
rule.
that's
what
the
court
said--
but
certainly
the
court
will
look
as...
as
in
faragher
and
in
ellerth,
the
court
looked
to
the
restatement
of
agency
which
for
the
most
part
is
a
compilation
of
decisions
rendered
by
state
courts.
so
it's...
it's
looking
to
the
law
of
the
states
generally,
but
it's
not
looking
to
the
law
of
a
particular
state.
so
with
respect
to
our
veil-piercing
argument,
we
would
say
that
the
court
should
devise
a
uniform
federal--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
think
that
the
claim
was
adequately
raised
in
the
district
court.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the...
the
plaintiffs--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
plaintiffs--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
plaintiffs...
the
plaintiffs
didn't
use
the
phrase,
veil-piercing,
but
on
page
of
the
joint
appendix,
for
instance,
they
alleged
that
mr.
meyer
is
the
designated
officer/broker
of
triad,
the
president
of
triad.
they
also
alleged
that
mr.
meyer...
they
alleged
that
mr.
meyer
was
the
sole
shareholder
of
triad.
in
addition,
as
mr.
schwemm
pointed
out--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
it's
true
that
they...
they
didn't
allege
in
the
complaint
inadequate
capitalization.
however,
as
mr.
schwemm
pointed
out,
there
was
a
colloquy
in
the
district
court
in
which
the
petitioner's
counsel
appeared
to
acknowledge
that
the
corporation
was
without
assets.
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
you're
right
that
the
primary
theory
that
the
respondents
advocated
in
the
district
court
was
based
on
mr.
meyer's--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
this...
this
was
raised
and
disputed
in
the
ninth
circuit;
that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--not
just
in
the
footnote.
in
the
ninth
circuit
at
page
7
and
8
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
ninth
circuit
having
turned
to
the
possible
liability
of
mr.
meyer
as
the
shareholder
of
triad.
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
petitioner
meyer
disputes
that
he
was
sued
in
that
capacity.
however,
the
ninth
circuit
goes
on
to
hold,
we
disagree.
we
think
that
claim
was
adequately
raised
in
the
district
court.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
but
the
ninth
circuit
clearly
understood
the
claim
against
meyer
as
shareholder
to
be
distinct
from
or
at
least
in
addition
to
the
claim
against
meyer
as
designated
officer/broker.
that
is,
what...
what
seems
to
us
to
make
this
a
paradigmatic
case
for
veil-piercing,
taking
the
facts--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
respondent,
is
the
combination
of
functions
that
mr.
meyer
played.
now,
it's
true
that
the
respondent
by
and
large
and
the
ninth
circuit
appeared
to
regard
these
distinct
functions
as
separate
and
independent
bases
for
liability.
but
in
our
view,
it's
only
a
short
step
to
say
even
if
no
one
of
the
roles
that
mr.
meyer
played
would
be
an
independently
sufficient
ground
for
imposing
personal
liability,
the
combination
of
functions,
together
with
the
inadequate...
apparent
inadequate
capitalization--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
is
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the...
the
ultimate...
there
was
not
a
separate
appeal,
but
the
ultimate
appeal
that
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
was
an
appeal
both
from
the
dismissal
of
certain
portions
of
the
complaint
and
from
the
grant
of
summary
judgment
with
respect
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
was
not
specific.
the...
the
appeal
from
the
dismissal
was
with
regard
to
mr.
meyer's
potential
liability
as
shareholder
and
the
appeal
from
the
grant
of
summary
judgment
with
regard
to
his
potential
liability
as
designated
officer/broker
was
based
on
the
grant
of
summary
judgment.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
would
acknowledge
that
the
theory
that...
that
we
and
the
respondents
have...
the
veil-piercing
theory
that
we
have
advanced
in
this
court
is
a
refinement
of
what
was
said
in
the
ninth
circuit.
but
it's...
it's
always
been
part
of
the
case
that
mr.
meyer's
liability
was
alleged
on
the
basis
of
his
status
as
shareholder,
his
status
as
designated
officer/broker,
his
status
as
president.
and
again,
the
claim
in
the
ninth
circuit
tended...
tended
to
be
more
that
these
were
independent
bases
for
liability.
and
our
view
is
that
no
one
of
them
would
be
sufficient
in
and
of
itself.
taken
together,
they
establish
that
mr.
meyer
exercised
pervasive
control
over--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there...
there--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that...
that's
correct.
the
district
judge
first
threw
out
on
12(b)(6)
everything
except
the
claim
against
mr.
meyer
as
designated
officer/broker,
and
subsequently
entered
summary
judgment
for
the
petitioner
on
that
claim.
and
then
there
was
a
final
judgment
and
that
was
taken
up
to
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that...
that's
correct.
now,
in
the
course
of
doing
discovery
on
the
designated
officer/broker
question,
they...
the
plaintiffs
unearthed
some
facts
that
are
potentially
relevant
to
the
veil-piercing
theory,
but
they've
had
no
discovery
on
veil-piercing
as
such.
and
another
important
criterion
in
determining
whether
veil-piercing
is
appropriate
is
whether
the
individual
bears
some
degree
of
personal
fault
for
the
wrong
alleged.
and
here,
the
plaintiffs'
allegation
is
that
mr.
meyer
negligently
supervised
mr.
crank,
that
that
was
a
contributing
factor
in
crank's
ultimate
misconduct,
and
that
would
suffice
to
show
that
aspect
of
the
veil-piercing
analysis.
i
think
it's
also
important
to
note
that
courts
are
typically
more
willing
to
pierce
the
veil
in
tort
cases
than
in
contract
cases;
that
this
court
has
described
the
fair
housing
act
as...
as
essentially
defining
a
new
type
of
tort.
the
theory
is
that
in
contract
cases,
an
individual
who
contracts
with
a
corporation
has
his
own
opportunity
to
assess
the...
the
corporation's
finances
and
decline
to
do
business
if
the
corporation
seems
likely
not
to
be
able
to
satisfy
its
obligations
whereas
in
a
tort
case
the...
the
potential
plaintiff
has
no
opportunity
to
do
that.
inadequate
capitalization
has
always
been
an
important
factor
in
veil-piercing
analysis,
and
really
it
goes
to
the
question
whether
the
incorporators
have
adequately
respected
the
independent
status
of
the
corporate
entity.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we...
we
don't.
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
it's
partly
that.
i
think
it's
partly
just
the
general
background
rule
is
individual
supervisors
are
ordinarily
not
vicariously
liable
for
torts
committed
by
the
people
they
supervise.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
may
i
answer?
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
if
a
consensus
developed
among
the
states
that
designated
officers/brokers
were
sufficiently
different
from
ordinary
supervisors
that
they
should
be
held
vicariously
liable,
then
we
would
advocate
that
as
the
general
federal
rule.
but
the
respondent
has
not
established
that
there
is
such
a
consensus.
