so--
--is
there
a
difference
in
the
licenses,
the
individual
license
that
justice
kennedy
was
referring
to
and
that's
mentioned
on
page
15
of
the
red
brief,
the
individual
broker
license
and
the
statement
that
the
individual
broker
licensee
is
vicariously
liable
and
the
broker
who
holds
the
license
under
the
corporate
name?
are
those
different
certificates?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
said
those
were
general
common
law
principles
that
are...
presumably
the
states
would
share.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
if
i
understand
your
argument
correctly,
you're
saying
that
the
discussion,
whether
it's
california
law
or
federal
common
law,
is
in
this
case
at
least
academic
because
under
california
law,
if
you
were
to
apply
it,
there
is
no
relief
for
these
plaintiffs,
that
the
only
remedy
where
it's...
the
license
is
held
in
the
corporate
name
is
a
disciplinary
sanction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
you
said
that
if...
if
this
were
a
license
to
an
individual
broker,
if
this
were
held...
the
license
were
held
by
meyer
as
an
individual...
that
he
would
then
have
a
principal
agent
relationship
with
crank.
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
an
issue
in
this
case
about
piercing
the
corporate
veil
as
a
means
of
holding
meyer
liable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
came--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
that
if...
that
a
judgment
winner,
as
the
holleys
are
at
this
stage,
can
defend
the
judgment
on
another
ground.
in
other
words,
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
in
their
favor
and
now
they're
saying,
well,
here's
another
theory
on
which
we
could
prevail.
i
didn't
know...
certainly
they
can't
get
an
immediate
victory,
but
if
they
attempt
to
defend
the
judgment
on
that
basis,
aren't
they
then
entitled
to
go
back
and
make
the
case
rather
than
taking
from
them
their
victory
and
saying
you
lose?
they
say,
but
we
have
another
theory
that
would
be
viable.
up
till
now,
we
won
with
this
one.
why
isn't
that
altogether
appropriate
they
should
now
be
given
a
chance
to
air
that
other
theory
in
support
of
the
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
said
there
was
no
genuine
issue...
no
triable
issue
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
that
there
were
no
facts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
the
question
is
the...
the
liability
of
mr.
meyer...
and
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
it's
not
a
trial.
you
don't
prove
your
case
at
that
point.
it's
only
if
there's
no
genuine
triable
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're...
the
point
you're
making
is
that
you
are
not
certainly
required
under
the
federal
rules
to
set
out
your...
any
theory
of
the
pleadings.
you
just
have
to
state
facts
showing
that
there's
a
claim
for
relief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stewart,
i'm...
i'm
confused
about
one
procedural
point.
was
there
not
a
final
judgment
in
the
district
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--at
the
end
of
the
rope,
one
final
judgment
that
says
that
defendant
wins
and
then
you...
from
that
final
judgment
you
can
take
up
all
the
rulings
against
the
verdict...
the...
the
judgment
loser?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
final
judgment
would
include
all
the
rulings
on
the
way
to
that
final
judgment
disposing
of
the
entire
case.
