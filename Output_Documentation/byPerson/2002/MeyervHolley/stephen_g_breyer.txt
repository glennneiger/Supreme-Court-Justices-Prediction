justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
there
were
a
bunch
of
things.
i
mean,
the
government
in
its
brief
lists
a
whole
bunch
of
things.
he
was
the
sole
shareholder.
he
was
the
president.
he
did
control
it.
he
paid
the
taxes
in
his
own
social
security
number.
he
made
various
transactions
that
violated
the
terms
under
which
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
corporate
form,
and
he
didn't
train
the
person
properly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
they
have
a
list
of
things
which
i
take
it
they
didn't
just
make
up,
that
they're
there
in
the
record.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then...
and
then
they
say
that,
well,
in
the
ninth
circuit
brief,
what
it
says
in
the
footnote
is
that
evidence...
evidence
will
show
that
meyer
is
the
sole
shareholder
of
triad,
and
thus
an
argument
to
pierce
the
corporate
veil
would
be
meritorious.
well,
they
don't
list
all
those
things
in
that
footnote.
that's
true.
but
we
should
send
it
back
and
let
the
ninth
circuit
decide.
i
guess
that's
basically
their
argument,
and
i
think
i
want
to
hear
as
complete
a
response
to
that
as...
as
you
have.
maybe
i've
heard
it
already.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
the
footnote...
they
mention
it
in
the
footnote.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's...
that's...
you're
quite
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--isn't
that
true
that...
that
you
have
to
have
something
more
than
simply
a
person
being
a
sole
owner
of
a
corporation?
otherwise
a
person
couldn't
create
a
corporation
with
himself
as
a
100
percent
owner.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
they're...
what
they're
saying
is
you
didn't
allege
anything
than
that,
and
you
certainly
didn't
support
anything
other
than
that
with
affidavits
or
other...
or
other
offers
of
proof.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
if
you...
if
you
didn't,
then
you're
out
of
luck,
aren't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i'm
not
saying
12(b)(6).
i
mean
on
summary
judgment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
have
your
complaint
here
on
page
16
and
17
of
the
joint
appendix.
first
claim,
fair
housing
act.
i
don't
see
anything
there
about...
about
veil-piercing
or
anything
like
that.
where...
where
is
it
in
the
complaint?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
or
anything
even
vaguely
like
that.
i
mean,
what
it
seems
to
say
is
that
mr.
meyer
himself
did
all
these
things,
or
through
his
agent.
now,
that's...
that's
what
it
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
see
where
it
says
he
owned
the
corporation.
what
i
don't
see
is
something
that
says,
and
therefore
he
is
liable
because
he
owned
it.
i
mean,
it
just
seems
to
be
the
part
where
you're
describing
the
parties.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
mean...
to
be
honest
with
you,
i'm
not...
i'm
just
debating
with
myself
whether
you...
we
should
send
this
back
to
the
ninth
circuit,
tell
them
work
this
out
or
not.
and
district
court
judges
are
not
mind-readers.
they...
they
can't
make
up
what
you're
saying
in
a
complaint
unless
you
say
it
and
unless
you
argue
it.
so...
so
that's
why
i'm
pressing
you
on
this.
i'm...
i'm
trying
to
find
the
particular
point
where
you
really
made
this
point
to
the
district
court
so
the
judge
would
focus
on
it
and
make
a
decision.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
he
didn't
seem
to,
in
his
opinion,
understand
it
because
the
only
reference
he
has
to
veil-piercing
seems
in
a
footnote
in
a
paragraph.
and
what
he
seems
to
be
saying
there
is
referring
to
a
different
argument,
the
argument
that
there
could
be
no
veil-piercing
because
he
didn't
even
own
this
corporation.
and
he
says,
that...
that's
really
wrong.
it's
not
true.
or
maybe
he
said
it
was
right,
but
he
was
wrong
if
he
said
it
was
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
evidently
that's
what
california
has
held,
and
given
the
wording,
it
seems
reasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
general
rule...
well,
we
can
ask
the
government...
what
the
general
rule
for
when
we
look
to
state
law
and
when
we
look
to
federal
law.
certainly
state
law
informs
what
the
federal
law
ought
to
be.
that's...
that's
faragher
and
burlington.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
isn't...
i
mean,
look.
the
judge
is
sitting
there
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
and
he
reads
the
complaint.
and
when
he
reads
the
complaint,
he
looks
to
claims,
and
he
sees
first
claim,
fair
housing
act,
which
doesn't
have
a
word
about
this
theory.
and
apparently
in
the
brief,
a
different
theory
was
produced,
the
one
that's
been
produced
today,
that
the
reason
they're
liable
is
not
because
we
want
to
pierce
the
veil,
but
because
it's
mr.
meyer
who's
really
the
holder
of
the
license
in
some
sense,
and
that
is
sufficient.
so
not
surprisingly,
the
district
court
says
that.
he
says
any
liability
against
meyer
as
an
officer
of
triad
would
attach
only
to
triad
in
that
plaintiffs
have
not
urged
theories
that
could
justify
reaching
meyer
individually,
with
one
exception.
and
he
then
goes
and
discusses
the
exception.
well,
if
i
were
a
district
judge,
i
would
have
thought
i
had
done
my
job
at
that
point
unless
somebody
came
in
and
petitioned
for
rehearing
and
said,
judge,
you
missed
something,
which
no
one
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
sole.
let's
try
sole
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
footnote.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of...
of
course,
what
was
raised
is
we
get
meyer
because
meyer
holds
the
license,
and
even
though
it's
held
in
the
name
of
the
corporation,
that
really
doesn't
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
maybe
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
is
actually.
i
mean,
it
says
that...
that
the...
the
defendant
violated
the
fair
housing
act
when
his
agent
discriminated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
it
says
in
paragraph
41.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
previously
in
paragraph
13,
it
lists
a
whole
lot
of
facts
about
the
relationship
of
mr.
meyer
to
the
company
including
the
fact
about
the
tax
numbers
and
so
forth.
and
so
what
they
say
is,
you
know,
the
complaint
doesn't
have
to
spell
out
every
theory,
but
it
does
state
some
facts
there
from
which
this
basis
could
be
fairly
inferred,
and
therefore
it
shouldn't
have
been
dismissed.
rather,
they
should
have
had
at
least
an
opportunity
to
argue
it.
i...
i
take
it
something
like
that
is
their
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
allegations
are
just
what
i
had
said,
paragraph--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
fair
housing
act
forbids
racial
discrimination
in
respect
to
the
sale
of
a
dwelling.
this
case
involves
discrimination
that
was
allegedly
engaged
in
by
a
corporation’s
employee.
he
was
a
real
estate
salesman
in
the
real
estate
company
with
a
corporation,
and
we
are
considering
a
victim
here
of
that
discrimination,
it
is
an
interracial
couple.
in
this
particular
aspect
of
the
case
that
we
are
considering,
they
have
sued
not
the
employee
nor
have
they
sued
the
corporation,
his
employer,
but
rather
they
have
sued
an
officer
of
the
corporation
and
its
sole
shareholder.
now
the
issue
raised
concerns
vicarious
liability.
that
is
the
kind
of
liability
that
traditionally
makes
an
employer
liable
without
fault
for
the
acts
of
an
employee
or
it
might
make
a
principle
liable
without
fault
for
the
acts
of
an
agent.
in
particular
question
we
have
to
consider
is
whether
in
deciding
who
is
liable
for
what
ordinary
rules
of
vicarious
liability
apply
and
those
ordinary
rules
would
normally
make
the
corporation
vicariously
liable
for
the
acts
of
the
corporation’s
employees
and
they
would
not
make
an
owner
or
a
corporate
officer
vicariously
liable
except
in
quite
special
circumstance.
now
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
ordinary
rules
do
not
apply.
rather
the
ninth
circuit
said
special
rules
apply,
and
those
special
rules
in
the
circuit’s
view
make
every
officer
of
a
corporation
and
shareholders,
personally
liable
without
fault
for
the
misbehavior
of
any
corporate
employee
as
long
as
the
officer
or
the
shareholder
“directs
or
controls”
or
has
the
right
to
direct
or
control
that
misbehaving
employee.
now
that
special
principle
goes
well
beyond
any
ordinary
vicarious
liability
principle
and
in
our
view,
ordinary
rules
of
vicarious
liability
apply
not
the
ninth
circuit
special
ones.
for
one
thing,
congress
said
nothing
in
the
act
about
extending
vicarious
liability
in
any
special
way.
in
fact,
it
said
nothing
in
the
act
about
vicarious
liability
at
all,
and
this
court’s
case
law
including
cases
involving
civil
right
statute
makes
clear
that
that
kind
of
silence
while
permitting
an
inference
that
congress
intended
to
apply
ordinary
background
tort
principles
cannot
show
that
congress
intended
to
apply
an
unusual
modification
of
those
rules.
rather
the
court
has
found
that
a
statute
applies
unusually
strict
rules
only
when
congress
has
specified
that
that
was
its
intent.
or
another
thing,
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development,
the
agency
primarily
charged
with
the
acts
implementation
and
administration
has
long
specified
that
ordinary
vicarious
liability
rules
apply
in
this
area,
and
the
court
normally
refers
to
administrative
agencies
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
have
also
examined
the
arguments
of
the
ninth
circuit
advanced
in
favor
of
its
interpretation,
and
for
reasons
set
out
in
the
opinion,
we
find
them
unconvincing.
consequently
we
hold
that
that
act
imposes
liability
without
fault
in
accordance
with
traditional
agency
principle.
the
respondents
in
this
case
make
other
claims,
including
the
claim
that
even
under
traditional
principles,
there
are
exceptions
that
would
make
those
traditional
of
principles
apply
here.
we
do
not
decide
these
matters.
we
say
however
that
the
ninth
circuit
remains
free
to
consider
them
on
remand
if
they
were
properly
raised.
consequently,
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
