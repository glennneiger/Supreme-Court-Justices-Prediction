mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
each
year's
annual
appropriations
act,
congress
has
prohibited
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco,
and
firearms
from
investigating
or
acting
upon
applications
for
discretionary
relief
from
firearms
disabilities
under
18
u.s.c.
925(c).
the
court
of
appeals
held
that,
in
the
face
of
that
statutory
bar,
a
federal
district
court
could
itself
grant
respondent
relief
from
firearms
disabilities.
that
holding
is
contrary
to
fundamental
principles
of
judicial
review
of
agency
action
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
under
the
apa--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
an
appropriations
law
is,
for
purposes
of
congress's
lawmaking
authority,
no
different
from
any
other
sort
of
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
now,
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
if
a
subsequent
appropriations
statute
is
said
to
repeal
or
suspend
the
application
of
a
prior
law,
that
intention
has
to
be
made
clear,
but
here
we
think
that
there's
no
question
that
the
annual
appropriations
act
is
clear.
there's
nothing
implied
about
what
congress
did
here.
there
is
an
express
prohibition
against
atf
either
investigating
or
acting
upon
applications
for
relief.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
i
mean,
effectively.
it's
a
suspension...
it's
an
annual...
a
suspension
for
a
period
of
1
year.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
absolutely.
congress
could
certainly
do
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
so
what
we
have
here
is
an
express
prohibition
against
atf
exercising
the
power
that
congress
conferred
on
it.
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
only
power
a
court
has
in
judicial
review
of
agency
action
is
to
review
what
the
agency
did,
and
it
may
only
set
aside
the
agency
action
if
the
agency
action
is
arbitrary
or
capricious
or
contrary
to
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
there
would
be
a
question
about
that.
as
i
recall,
there
was,
and
i
think
it
still
may
be
true
that
courts
may
grant
applications
for
naturalization,
but
the
court
i
believe
concluded
that
there
was
at
least
an
implicit
adversarial
process
in
the
sense
that
the
government
could
appear
on
the
other
side
of
the
case
and
oppose
it,
but
i
think
you
raise
a
very
good
point
in
terms
of
what
would
be
the
traditional
way
that
something
like
this
would
be
accomplished,
and
that
is
that
it
would
be
natural,
and
this
is
what
congress
did
in
925(c),
to
confer
this
authority
on
the
executive
branch,
and
it
did
it
in
very
broad
and
general
terms
and
then
provided
that
a
person
whose
application
is
denied
may
file
a
petition
in
district
court
for
judicial
review
of
such
denial.
in
other
words,
under
925(c)
it
is
the
denial
by
the
atf,
not
the
application
itself,
that
is
the
subject
of
judicial
review.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
think
it
is
not.
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
we
believe
the
word
denial
in
that
context
means
a
denial
on
the
merits,
and
this
is
what
a
number
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
looked
at
the
question
have
held,
and
what
congress
said
in
the
appropriations
act
is
that
atf
is
barred
from
even
acting
upon
the
application.
in
other
words,
it
can't
either
grant
or
deny
the
application
for
relief,
and
therefore
the
predicate
for
judicial
review
under
925(c)
is
missing.
we're
not
saying
that
there
is
no
judicial
review
at
all.
the
general
provisions
of
the
apa
remain
available
and,
under
5
u.s.c.
703,
the
avenue
for
judicial
review,
or
the
form
of
the
judicial
review
is
either
the
special
statutory
review
procedure,
in
this
case
925(c),
or
in
the
absence
of
that
or
its
inadequacy,
then
another
appropriate
form,
in
other
words,
the
general
provisions
of
the
apa.
but
once
again,
the
power
of
a
court
under
the
general
provisions
of
the
apa
is
simply
to
review
the
agency's
action
and
to
set
it
aside
if
contrary
to
law,
and
here
the
action
was
not
contrary
to
law,
it
was
compelled
by
law.
the
most
direct
avenue
that
respondent
could
have
challenged
the
agency's
approach
in
this
case,
its
failure
to
act,
was
under
section
706(1),
which
provides
for
a
court
in
reviewing
agency
action
to
set
aside
agency
action
that
is...
or
excuse
me,
to
compel
agency
action
that
is
unreasonably
delayed
or
unlawfully
withheld;
and,
again,
there
was
nothing
unlawful
about
atf's
withholding
of
a
decision
on
respondent's
application
for
relief,
because
congress
compelled
that
withholding.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
yes,
we
have.
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
foreign
convictions
are
covered
by
the
act.
now,
that
is
not
before
the
court.
the...
in
fact,
below
respondent
conceded
that
a
foreign
conviction
is
a
proper
predicate
under
922(g)(1),
and
the
eleventh
circuit
expressly
declined
to
reach
that
question.
it
wasn't
presented
in
the
petition
and
it's
not
before
this
court.
indeed,
the
question
of
whether
a
foreign
conviction
would
be
a
proper
predicate
is
something
that
would
be
raised
under
922(g)
in
a
prosecution.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
is
a
circuit
conflict
on
that
question,
but
that
conflict
has
arisen
in
cases,
criminal
prosecutions
brought
under
922(g),
and
that
would
be
the
proper
place
to
begin
to
make
that
claim.
neither
the
general
provisions
of
the
apa
nor
925(c)
provides
someone
who
is
wondering
whether
he
may
or
may
not
be
covered
by
a
provision
of
the
federal
criminal
laws
to
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
against
the
united
states
to
determine
whether
conduct
he
hopes
to
engage
in
would
be
covered
by
a
particular
criminal
statute.
so
even
though
it...
it
isn't
before
this
court,
but
we
also
believe
that
this
would
not
be
the
proper
avenue
in
which
to
raise
such
a
claim
in
any
event.
respondent
has
argued
that
what
is
going
on
here
is
an
implied
repeal
of
the
judicial
review
provisions
or
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
to
act
in
a
case
such
as
this
and,
as
i've
said,
there's
nothing
implied.
what
congress
did
was
expressly
bar
atf,
and
it
otherwise
left
the
court's
authority
unaffected.
925(c)
remains
in
effect.
it's
just
that,
by
virtue
of
congress's
prohibiting
atf
from
acting
on
applications
for
relief,
there
is
no
denial
which
could
be
the
predicate
for
review
under
that,
under
that
special
statutory
review
procedure.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that's
the
better
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
again,
the...
our
position
is
not
that
congress
amended
the
judicial
review
provision
of
925(c).
what
it
did
was
prohibit
atf
from
acting.
925(c)'s
judicial
review
procedure
is
still
in
effect.
the
question
is
whether
the...
whether
congress's
directive
to
atf
not
to
even
act
upon
applications
for
relief
constitutes
a
denial
and,
as
i
say,
atf
is
barred
from
either
granting
or
denying
relief,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
also
to
the
general
definition
of
agency
action
under
the
apa,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
this
is
5
u.s.c.
551
(13).
it
defines
agency
action
as
an
agency
rule,
order,
license,
sanction,
relief,
or
the
equivalent,
or
the
denial
thereof,
or
a
failure
to
act.
so
under
the
apa,
which
is
the
general
statute
governing
traditional
review
of
agency
action,
congress
itself
has
defined
a
denial
of
relief
as
something
different
from
a
failure
to
act,
and
i
think
there's
every
reason
to
look
at
925(c)'s
reference
to
a
denial
as
being
consistent,
rather
than
inconsistent
with
the
general
definitions
that
congress
has
applied
under
the
apa.
i
would
also
add,
though,
that
it
doesn't
matter,
that
even
if
the
atf's
decision
were
viewed
as
a
denial
within
the
meaning
of
925(c),
the
general
apa
standards
for
reviewing
that
denial
still
apply.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
this
court's
decision
in
zurko
and
the
prior
decision
in
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
both
make
clear
that,
even
where
you
do
have
a
special
statutory
review
procedure
that
establishes
the
form
for
judicial
review,
the
nature
and
character,
as
the
court
said
in
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers,
of
that
judicial
review
is
defined
by
the
general
provisions
of
the
apa,
section
706;
and
again,
under
those
provisions
the
court
can
only
set
aside
agency
action
that
is
contrary
to
law;
and
again,
here,
the
atf's
action
was
compelled
by
law,
not
contrary
to
it.
so
whichever
avenue
this
suit
was
thought
to
have
been
brought
under,
there
was
no
basis
for
the
district
court
to
grant
relief
at
all,
and
we
also
think
that
that
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
congress's
purposes
in
enacting
the
appropriations
bar.
the
legislative
history
which
respondent
has
produced
as
an
appendix
to
his
brief
explains
that
congress
had
become
concerned
about
the
inherently
subjective
nature
of
the
inquiry
that
atf
was
undertaking,
and
the
severe
consequences
that
could
result
if
atf
had
made
a
mistake,
and
also
that
congress
believed
that
the
money
that
was
being
spent
for
that
purpose,
$4
million
a
year
for
40
positions
at
atf,
would
be
better
served--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
what
it
decided
to
do
is
to
proceed
on
an
annual
basis.
it
would...
which
means
it
could
be
subject
to
revision
each
year.
it
was
a
practical
compromise.
the
third
circuit
explained
in
pontarelli
that
the
same
people
who
were
supporting
a
permanent
repeal
in
1992
were
also
the
movants
for
the
annual
appropriations
rider
on
the
theory
that
it
accomplished
essentially
the
same
thing
on
an
annual
basis.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
in
the
provision
for
atf.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
not,
for
there
is
another
sentence
in
the
appropriations
provision
for
atf
which
says
that
no
money
may
be
spent
to
transfer
functions
from
atf
to
another
department
or
agency,
and
i
think
the
reference
to
agency
in
that
provision
would
probably
include
other
provisions...
or
excuse
me,
other
agencies
within
the
department
of
the
treasury,
and
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
personally
couldn't
be
expected
to
act
on
applications
like
this.
the
secretary,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
dunne
decision,
has--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
says,
no
funds
shall
be
spent...
i
believe
it
says,
under
this
act,
to
transfer
functions
to
another
agency
within
atf.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
clear
import
of
what
congress
directed
is,
the
function
shall
not
be
transferred.
that
was
clearly
what
congress
was
driving
at.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
but
the
secretary...
first
of
all,
as
congress
well
knew
when
it
passed
this
appropriations
rider,
the
secretary
has
delegated
the
authority
for
acting
on
these
applications
to
atf.
that
is
the
legal
framework
against
which--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--perhaps
he...
i
mean,
he
presumably
could,
but
the
proper
avenue
for
a
respondent
to
pursue
in
that
situation
would
be
to
request
atf...
or
excuse
me,
the
secretary
to
revoke
the
regulation
that
produced
the
delegation,
and
then
if
the
secretary
declined
to
do
that,
to
seek
review
of
that
under
the
apa
on
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
respondent
has
not
pursued
that
avenue,
and
we
think
it
would
manifestly
not
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
the
secretary
to
withdraw
that
delegation
and
take
on
that
function
himself
with
all
the
other
functions
that
are
before
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
with
respect
to
the
nation's
economy
and
banking
and
all
those
other
matters,
and
in
particular
it
would
not
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
the
secretary
to
decline
to
do
that
in
the
face
of
the
appropriations
bar
that
congress
has
enacted,
with
the...
again,
with
the
clear
understanding
that
it
didn't
want
these
applications
to
be
acted
on
administratively,
but
in
any
event--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--excuse
me.
that's
correct,
but
it
would...
but
even
the
admission
or
acceptance
of
additional
evidence
would
be
in
aid
of
the
apa
review,
which
is,
again,
of
the
agency's
decision.
a
court
receiving
evidence
is
not
unheard
of
under
the
apa,
even
under
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
overton
park,
occasionally
there
will
be
situations
in
which
additional
evidence
or
an
explanation
from
the
agency
could
be
received
in
judicial
review,
but
that's
only
supplemental
of
the
record
that
was
before
the
agency.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
question
before
the
court
would
be
whether
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
unlawful,
and
again,
it
wasn't
unlawful
because
congress
compelled
it.
congress
compelled
the
secretary
or
atf
not
to
act
on
the
application.
now,
whether
or
not
that's
called
a
denial,
the
bottom
line,
the
failure
to
afford
any
relief,
was
compelled
by
congress,
so
the
agency
could
not
set...
or,
excuse
me,
the
court
could
not
set
that
aside.
looked
at
another
way,
the
only
relevant
evidence
that
would
be
introduced
in
court
would
be
evidence
of
the
fact
that
respondent
had
applied
during
a
time
when
the
statutory
bar
on
atf's
action
was
pending.
that
is
the
only
relevant
evidence
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
would.
it
would
violate
this
statute.
the
order,
whatever
they
might
have
read
on
their
own
time
the
order
would
be
taken
in
their
official
capacity,
and
the...
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
would
still
be
a...
the
second--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
says
expend
funds,
but
it
means
to
act...
but
it
says,
to...
it
is
directed
to
the
actions
of
the
atf
in
its
official
capacity.
only
an
official
act
of
atf
could
relieve
someone
from
firearms
disabilities.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
are
paid
for
the
office,
not
for
the
work
that
they
are
performing,
nor
could
the
secretary
direct
atf
to
grant
it,
because
again
he
would
be
directing
an
unlawful
act.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
the
argument
that
the
secretary
could
have
granted
relief
was
never
raised
below
in
this
case.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
brief
in
opp,
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
respondent's
brief,
and
again
if...
we
think
the
proper
avenue
for
that
would
be
a
suit
to
the...
suing
the
secretary
under
the
apa
or--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i...
first
of
all,
i
think
it
is
wrong.
it
would
be
a
different
disposition
of
the
judgment,
but
with
respect--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there's...
first
of
all,
let
me
make
another
point
which
i
think
goes
very
much
to
the
secretary's
authority.
we
point
out
on
page
4
and
5
of
our
reply
brief
general
principles
of
appropriations
law
that
are
really
a
particular
application
of
the
general
principle
that
the
specific
governs
the
general,
and
under
appropriations
law,
when
congress
appropriates
a
pot
of
money
for
a
particular
task,
that's
all
that
can
be
spent
for
that
task.
money
can't
be
drawn
from
some
other
pot
to
perform
that
task.
we
think
that
principle
should
apply
a
fortiori,
or
at
least
it's
a
reasonable
interpretation
for
the
secretary
to
make,
that
when
congress
has
prohibited
the
expenditure
of
any
funds
by
the
agency
to
whom
the
secretary
has
delegated
that
authority,
that
congress
did
not
expect
money
to
be
drawn
from
some
other
pot.
that
is
a
general
principle
of
appropriations
law.
at
the
very
least,
the
secretary
should
be
given
the
opportunity--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
are
a
number
of
comptroller
general
opinions
that
we
cite
at
the
bottom
of
page
4
of
our
reply
brief,
and
it's
against
principles
like
that
that
agencies
always
act
in
deciding
how
they're
going
to
spend
money.
but
if
this
argument
was
going
to
be
made,
the
right
disposition
would
be
to
present
it
to
the
secretary,
so
the
secretary
can
construe
this
statute,
just
like
all
the
other
statutes
that
need
to
be
administered,
and
the
way
to
do
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
at
the
very
least
it
would
not
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
the
secretary
to
decline
to
withdraw
the
delegation.
that,
we
think,
is
the
question
that
would
arise
in
that
situation,
because
the
secretary
now
may
not
act
on
these
applications.
he...
the
atf
acts
under
the
general
direction
of
the
secretary,
but
if
the
secretary
directed
atf
to
grant
one
of
these
applications,
he
would
be
directing
an
illegal
act.
he
would
have
to
withdraw
the
delegation.
he
hasn't
been
asked
by
respondent
to
do
that,
which
would
require
a
petition
for
rulemaking.
the
secretary,
in
deciding
whether
to
take
this
power
back
to
himself,
could
at
the
very
least
take
into
account
what
congress
has
said
about
not
wanting
these
applications
to
be
acted
upon
by
atf,
and
also
the
reasons
the
congress
gave,
which
is
that
this
is
a
very
subjective
undertaking,
with
high
risk,
and
congress
decided,
we
don't
want
this
function
being
performed
because
of
the
potential
consequences.
we
want
this
money
to
be
used
for
other
purposes
in
fighting
crime.
all
of
that
would
make
it
entirely
reasonable
for
the
secretary
not
to
take
on
this
function
himself.
the
other
important
point
to
notice
is
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
was
just
going
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--he
does
not...
nothing
in
the
statute
says
that
the
secretary
must
act
on
applications.
it
says
the
secretary
may
grant
relief.
it
does
not
require
him
to
grant
relief,
and
the
secretary
could
very
easily
withhold
action,
which
is,
after
all,
what
congress
required
atf
to
do.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
very
much
so.
it's...
it's,
or,
as
the
court
said
four
or
five
terms
ago
in
the
yang
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
with
respect
to
relief
from
deportation,
it
is
exactly
like
the
pardon
power,
and
it's
written
in
very
broad
terms.
it
establishes
several
preconditions,
whether
the
person
would
be
dangerous
to
the
public
safety,
and
whether
granting
it
would
not
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest,
and
even
then
the
secretary
is
not
required
to
grant
relief.
this
is
a
very
broad
discretionary
power,
and
i
think
it
ties
into
what
justice
ginsburg
was
asking
earlier,
wouldn't
this
be
an
extraordinary
power
to
give
to
the
federal
district
courts.
indeed
it
would,
because
the
question
is
not
just
whether
the
person
might
be
dangerous,
but
whether
granting
relief
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
that's
not
the
sort
of
determination
a
court
can
make
in
the
first
instance.
it's
something
that
congress
has
assigned
to
the
secretary.
in
this
case,
even
if
respondent
is
correct
that
he
wouldn't
be
dangerous,
it
doesn't
follow
that
restoration
of
firearms
abilities
would
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
that's
a
judgment
that
congress
invested
in
the
secretary,
not
in
the
courts,
and
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
atf
could
not
investigate
an
application
for
relief
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding
any
more
than
it
could
in
an
administrative
proceeding.
the
atf
agent
who
testified
in
this
case
was
one
of
respondent's
witnesses.
he
was
not
called
by
the
government.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
pardon
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that
would
be...
we
did
not
object,
the
government
did
not
object
in
the
district
court
to
his
testifying.
he
was
just
testifying
as
to
what
he
had
looked
up
in
the
records,
but
an
investigation
involves
far
more
than
that.
in
fact,
the
ausa
in
this
case
cross-examined
mr.
bean
and
a
couple
of
other
witnesses,
but
that's
far
short
of
the
investigation
that
congress
expected
atf
to
undertake
when
it
was
performing
these
functions,
and
that
it
did
undertake,
which
involved
an
investigation
of
the
crime,
neighbors,
not
just
the
people
whom
respondent
has
put
forward,
but
atf
would
go
out
and
develop
its
own
independent
leads.
none
of
that
capability
exists
when
the
government
is
responding
to
an
application
filed
in
court.
so
for
these
reasons
we
think
it
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
do
believe
it's...
it
is
broad
enough.
i
think
the
secretary...
all
it
says
is,
the
secretary
may
grant
relief.
i
think
the
secretary
could
decide,
and
in
fact
the
regulations,
144(d)
has
some
categorical
exclusions
that
the
secretary
had
adopted
but
the
district
court
in
this
case
ignored.
even...
we
think
the
court
couldn't
act
at
all,
but
it
even
ignored
the
standards
that
the
secretary
had
adopted
in
the
public
interest
to
implement
what
would
be
a
public
interest
standard
under
the
statute.
the
district
court
ignored
them,
so
we
think
that
the
secretary
could
make
a
categorical
determination
not
to
grant
relief.
