chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
01-704,
united
states
v.
bean.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
our
holding
in
roberts,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
the
holding
of
dickerson,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
didn't
it
just
repeal
the
thing,
then,
because
it
didn't
have
the
votes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
much
money
does
the...
would
the
secretary
spend
if
he
signed
an
order
transferring
a
function?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
could
revoke.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't...
the
statute
doesn't
say,
official
capacity.
it
says,
expend
funds.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
goldstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
did
your
client
seek
to
proceed
before
the
secretary?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
was
not
a
personal
conversation
between
the
two,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
you're
saying
is
that
congress
was
just
wasting
its
time
here.
it
was
trying
to
do
something.
it
just
didn't
accomplish
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
know
that?
you
say
the
scheme
that
results,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
see
that
from
the
enactment
in
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the...
that
just
doesn't
fit
with
the
real
world.
the
idea
that
the
secretary
on
his
way
to
the
international
monetary
fund
meeting
is
going
to
address
an
application
like
this
just
doesn't
make
sense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
know
that
that
was
the
holding
of
dickerson.
i
mean,
they
went
into
legislative
history...
you
couldn't
just
say
it
jumped
out
at
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
authority
for
saying
that's
a
general
principle
of
appropriations
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
