how
does
the
statute
make
it
clear
that
it's
a
personal
obligation
or
a
nondelegable
obligation?
what
are
the
words
that
it
uses,
or
that
those
statutes
use?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
i'm
sorry,
my
question
wasn't
clear.
i
want
to
go
to
the
examples
that
you
were
giving
of
personal
obligation.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
used
the
adverb,
personally--
justice
david
h.
souter
--certify,
et
cetera.
how
do
they
provide
for
that
so-called
personal
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
we
don't
have
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
it
didn't
say
that
because
it
thought
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
if
it
didn't
want
public
money
used
under...
by
the
delegate,
it
presumably
wouldn't
want
public
funds
used
for
the
same
purpose
by
everybody
else,
which
seems
like
a
fairly
reasonable
assumption.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
why
isn't
it
a
reasonable
assumption?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it
is
a
reasonable
assumption,
haven't
we
got
to
take
that
into
consideration
in
interpreting
the
annual
bar,
and
hold
against
you,
otherwise
we'll
be
clearly...
we
would
clearly
be
going
against
the
intent
of
congress?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the...
that
provision
assumes
that
there
is
going
to
be
action
upon
the
request,
that
the
atf
or
the
treasury
will
take
it
under
advisement
and
in
effect
say,
yes,
we'll
tell
you
yes
or
no
when
we've
had
time,
and
that's
not
what
is
happening
here,
and
if
that,
in
fact,
is
a
fair
distinction,
then
the
statute
you're
just
referring
to
doesn't
even
apply.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
once
again,
we're
just
going
around
in
a
circle.
if
we
accept
your
premise,
sure.
if
we
don't
accept
your
premise
that
a
refusal
to
act
and,
in
fact,
a
very
candid
refusal
to
act
is
tantamount
to
a
denial,
then
your
conclusion
doesn't
follow
and
the
statute
that
you
refer
to
doesn't
apply.
