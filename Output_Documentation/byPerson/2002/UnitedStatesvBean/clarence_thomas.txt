justice
clarence
thomas
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
united
states
versus
bean,
no.
01-704.
this
case
comes
to
use
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
18
u.s.c.
section
922(g)(1)
prohibits
a
person
convicted
of
a
felony
from
possessing
firearms.
18
u.s.c.
section
925(c)
authorizes
the
secretary
of
treasury
to
grant
relief
from
that
prohibition
if
it
is
established
to
his
satisfaction
that
certain
preconditions
are
met.
an
applicant
may
seek
judicial
review
from
the
united
states
district
court
if
his
application
is
denied
by
the
secretary.
since
1992,
however,
an
appropriations
bar
has
prevented
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco,
and
firearms
to
which
the
secretary
has
delegated
authority
to
act
on
section
925(c)
applications
from
using
funds
appropriated
herein
to
investigate
or
act
upon
applications
for
relief
from
federal
firearms
disabilities
under
18
u.s.c.
925(c).
atf
upon
receipt
of
respondent's
petition
returned
it
explaining
that
the
appropriations
bar
prevents
atf
from
acting
on
it.
respondent
contends
that
atf's
failure
to
act
constitutes
a
denial
within
the
meaning
of
925(c)
and
that
therefore
district
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
review
such
action.
the
lower
courts
agreed
with
the
respondent.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed.
inaction
by
atf
does
not
amount
to
denial
within
the
meaning
of
section
925(c).
the
text
of
section
925(c)
and
the
procedure
it
sets
out
for
seeking
relief
may
clear
that
an
actual
decision
by
atf
on
the
application
is
a
prerequisite
to
judicial
review
and
that
mere
inaction
by
atf
does
not
invest
a
district
court
with
independent
jurisdiction
to
act
on
the
application.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
