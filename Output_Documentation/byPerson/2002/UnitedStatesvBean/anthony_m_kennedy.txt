justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
congress...
well,
maybe...
i
mean,
i
suppose
congress
could
say,
this
law
that
we
enacted
a
year
ago
is
suspended
for
10
years.
it
will
not
go
into
effect
for
10
years.
i
suppose
it
could
say
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
if
it
really
bears
on
the
case,
but
suppose
congress
had
a
completely
different
scheme,
and
it
said
that
the
firearms
violator's
license
could
be
restored
if
he
applied
to
united
states
district
court,
no
agency
at
all,
you
just
go
to
court.
would
that
be
a
violation
of
article
iii?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
was
in
the
appropriations
law
just
for
the
atf,
or
for
the
whole
treasury
department?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
the
secretary
had
some
other
agency...
the
secret
service
didn't
have
much
to
do
that
month;
could
he
direct
them
to
process
some
of
these
applications?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
he
abuse
his
discretion
if
he
took
that
function
away
from
atf?
you
say
that
there's
a
provision
in
the
statute
that
he...
that
the
secretary
himself
cannot
transfer
the
function?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why...
if
the
united
states
was
a
party,
as
i
suppose
is
the
purport
of
what
you're
saying,
why
isn't
that
a
violation
of
the
appropriations
rider,
so
that
we
must
disregard
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still
think
participation
by
atf
in
the
judicial
proceeding
is
within
925(c),
and
congress
was
forbidden
that,
too.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
was
an
atf
agent
who
testified,
and
that's
within
925...
the
purview
of
925(c),
and
congress
says
you
can't
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what,
on
the
ground
that
it's
like
the
pardon
power,
it's
like
a
matter
of
grace,
or
something
like
that?
