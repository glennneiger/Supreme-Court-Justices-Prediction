justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
supposing
the
secretary
or
the
head
of
the
atf,
either
or
both...
say
they
spent
the
weekend
together
sometimes.
they
read
through
the
papers
on
their
own
time
on
a
sunday
afternoon
and
said,
gee,
this
is
a
case
of
rank
injustice,
i
think
we're
going
to
grant
the
petition,
and
they
entered
some
kind
of
an
order
granting
it,
would
that
have
violated
any
statutes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
in
their
official
capacities
but
it
wouldn't
have
cost
the
government
a
dime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
goldstein,
let
me
just
be
sure
about
one
thing.
is
your
submission
limited
to
cases
that
you
think
are
totally
clear
on
their
face,
or
does
it
cover
cases
when
there
are
marginal
issues
of
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you've
had
a
chance
to
complete
your
rebuttal,
i
had
one
question.
do
you
think
the
secretary's
authority
under
the
statute
is
broad
enough
so,
even
without
any
act
of
congress
or
anything
in
the
appropriation,
the
secretary
could
have
adopted
a
policy,
we
would
rather
use
our
money
on
other
purposes
and
so
we're
not
going
to
process
any
applications?
justice
stevens
