justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
that
that's
an
argument.
i
mean,
i
concede
that.
i'm
still
left
back
at
justice
scalia's
question,
because
i
thought
in
response
to
his
question
you...
i
had
the
impression
you
were
suggesting
that
the
secretary
had
somewhere
written
a
piece
of
paper
that
in
effect
denied
the
application,
and
i
looked
through
this
appendix...
i've
been
doing
that
and
listening
at
the
same
time--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
cannot
find
that
letter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
i
find
in
the
appendix
is
something
written
by
ms.
pamela
potaczek,
who
is
from
the
atf,
and
what
that
says
is,
because
of
the
restriction
we
are
returning
mr.
bean's
application
for
restoration.
that's
the
end
of
that.
he
can
apply
again.
now,
is
there
some
other
piece
of
paper?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
if
there
is
no
other
piece
of
paper,
what
is
the
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
which
was
simply
that
there
has
been
no
denial?
they
return
the
application,
and
if
your
client
felt
that
they
should
have
acted
on
it,
he
should
file
a
request
in
the
district
court
for...
of
course,
as
soon
as
you
do
that,
the
secretary
will
come
in
and
say,
of
course
i
didn't
act
on
it.
that's
what
congress
meant.
and
then
the
question
will
be
whether
that's
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
this
statute,
and
then,
of
course,
the
government
thinks
of
course
it's
a
reasonable
interpretation,
and
even
if
it's
an
incorrect
interpretation,
at
least
reasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
where
i
am,
which
is,
i
think,
what
justice
scalia
was
raising.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
respect
to
that,
is
there
an
instance
where
they
sent
a
letter
back
to
a
firearms
licensee
saying,
well,
we
aren't
going
to
process
this
because
of
the
statute,
and
then
the
firearms
licensee
said,
well,
you
haven't
denied
it,
i'll
stay
in
business,
and
then
they
went
to
the
firearms
licensee
and
said,
no,
you
can't
stay
in
business?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
if
we
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
we
don't
know,
in
other
words,
whether
or
not
this
reg
does
or
does
not
stand
in
the
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
understand--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--uh-huh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
serious
underlying
question
here
is,
i
agree
with
you
that
you
found
a
literal
way
around
this,
and
so
you're
saying,
well,
if
there's
a
literal
way
around
it,
and
you
have
a
statute
saying
do
it,
that
you
ought
to
do
it,
whatever
the
form
of
the
action
is
to
get
the
case
here,
and
i
guess
the
underlying
thing
is,
well,
my
goodness,
everyone
knows
what
congress
wants
here.
it's
perfectly
obvious.
and
so
a
secretary
who
said,
i'm
not
going
to
enforce
this
statute
because
congress
doesn't
want
me
to
even
though
there's
a
literal
way
i
could
do
it
without
technically
violating
the
actual
language
of
the
prohibition,
does
the
secretary
have
the
right
to
do
that?
well,
i
would
think
the
answer
to
that
question's
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
otherwise
congress
can't
work.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
his
point,
and
actually
although
he
raised
it
late,
is
certainly
a
factor.
that
seems
to
me
the
most
powerful
argument,
that
there's
no
point
sending
it
back
to
the
secretary,
really,
even
though
that's
the
correct
procedural
route,
if
the
secretary
under
the
law
has
no
choice,
and
what
he's
saying
is,
the
secretary
under
the
law
has
no
choice,
and
the
reason
is
because
literally
this
appropriations
measure
doesn't
cover
the
secretary's
action.
and
given
the
absence
of
that,
the
secretary's
under
a
statute
that
tells
him,
act,
and
moreover,
he
adds,
this
is
a
very
bad
way
to
repeal
a
statute,
that
really
under
normal
legislative
principles
if
they
want
to
repeal
it,
repeal
it;
and
therefore
it
isn't
wrong
for
us
to
consider
this
literally
in
this
circumstance.
so
that,
i
think,
is...
that's
an
argument
that's
worth
hearing
what
the
reply
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
maybe
we'd
reach
a
different--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
disposition
would
be
one
thing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
he's
saying,
that's
really
what
the
heart
of
this
is
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
testifying
investigation?
