mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress,
in
section
925(c),
provided
individuals
like
respondent
tommy
bean
two
rights
vis
a
vis
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
of
america.
individuals
may
apply
to,
quote,
unquote,
"the
secretary"
for
relief
from
firearms
disabilities
and,
if
the
secretary
denies
that
application,
they
may
secure
judicial
review.
the
obvious
flaw
in
the
government's
position
this
morning,
as
several
of
the
later
questions
identified,
is
that
congress
has
never,
expressly
or
impliedly
repealed
those
rights
vis
a
vis
the
secretary.
the
appropriations
statutes
that
are
before
you
address
only
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco,
and
firearms.
congress
has
set
aside
a
separate
and
special
budget
for
the
department
of
the
treasury
generally,
which
is
under
the
control
of
the
secretary,
it's
for
$123
million,
and
the
right
to
proceed
before
the
secretary
is
unaffected.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
page
27
of
the
joint
appendix
is
the
application.
it's
directed
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
care
of
batf.
we
went,
as
the
statute
directs,
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
told
tommy
bean
that
he
was
not
going
to
restore
firearms
rights.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
don't
have
his
number.
that's
right.
we
wrote
him
a
letter,
as
the
statute
requires.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--with
respect,
the
premise
and
the
conclusion
are
not...
of
your
question
are
not
correct.
the
atf
on
behalf
of
the
secretary
said,
i'm
not
going
to
grant
you
this
relief.
the
definition
of
denial...
the
statute
does
not
say,
denial
on
the
merits.
the
definition
of
denial
is
a
refusal
to
grant
the
requested
relief.
that's--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--can
i
address
both
the
question
of
whether
there
are
other
examples
of
the
scheme
we've
described,
which
is
to
say,
the
agency
head
does
it,
and
then
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
if
this
were
a
novel
scheme,
it
would
matter?
the
premise
that
there
aren't
parallels
for
this
is
not
correct.
i
can
give
you
three
examples.
the
attorney
general
is
required
to
personally
certify
any
person
who's
going
to
be
subject
to
the
federal
death
penalty.
that's
42
u.s.c....
18
u.s.c.
3593.
under
the
civil
rights
for
institutionalized
persons
act,
which
is
42
u.s.c.
1997(a),
the
attorney
general
is
required
to
personally
certify
a
prosecution,
and
there
are
various
federal
criminal
prosecutions
for
civil
rights
violations,
which
are
at
18
u.s.c.
245.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it's
the
two
in
combination.
925(c)
says
the
secretary.
921(a)(17)
defines
the
secretary
to
mean
that
individual
or
the
delegate.
then,
what
congress
did
is,
it
came
along
in
the
appropriations
action,
act
and
said,
we
recognize...
well,
i'll
give...
the
literal
language
is
that
the
atf
may
not
investigate
or
act
upon--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
apologize.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
they
generally
say,
the
attorney
general
shall
certify,
and
the
courts
have
interpreted
that...
i
believe
there
is
an
example
that
says,
personally.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
definitely
do
not
have
here,
but
we
have
the
equivalent,
and
then
i'll
get
to
justice,
the
underlying
question
of
justice
ginsburg's,
and
that
is,
does
it
matter
if
this
is
done
in
a
different
way.
we
have
here
the
parallel,
because
what
happened
is
that
congress
defined
the
secretary
to
be
that
individual
or
the
delegate,
and
in
the
appropriations
laws
has
told
atf,
as
the
delegate,
that
they
may
not
act
on
anything
else,
and
the
parallel
provision
that
mr.
kneedler
pointed
to,
which
is
that
the
secretary
may
not
transfer
to
any
other
division
or
agency.
what
congress
did
not
say...
and
this
is
extraordinarily
important.
it's
the
key
to
the
entire
case.
congress
did
not
say
that
no
funds
in
this
or
any
other
act,
or
no
funds
in
the
subsection
dealing
with
the
budget
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
may
be
used.
now,
it
is
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--maybe--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
may
be,
but
what--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
and
that's
the
underlying
point
to
justice
ginsburg's
questions.
this
court--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--and
let
me
explain
why.
the
27
c.f.r.
178144(a),
which
has
never
been
repealed,
required
us
to
send
it
to
atf.
we
had
no
choice.
there's
a
regulation
on
the
books
that
says
we
have
to
submit
it
to
the
director.
we
didn't
have
a
choice,
but
to
make
perfectly
clear
that
it
was
directed
to
the
secretary
we
say,
we
send
it
to
the
secretary
care
of
atf.
but
i
need
to
return
to
justice
souter's
question,
which
is,
is
it
good
enough
in
this
case,
as
in
many
other
instances
of
statutory
construction,
to
say,
we
get
the
general
sense
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
do?
the
answer
is
no.
in
this
area
of
law
uniquely,
congress
has
to
turn
square
corners.
the
relevant
text
of
any
statute
is
section
925(c).
it's
never
been
repealed.
it
says--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
let
me
get
to
that
point,
and
that
is,
i
agree
with
you
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
say
that
the
appropriations
acts
are
completely
ineffective,
and
if
our
interpretation
were
to
deprive
them
of
any
value,
we
agree
it
would
be
highly
questionable.
it
is
not.
the
scheme
that
results
is
clearly
one
under
which
the
secretary
will
grant
only
those
applications
where
the
right
to
relief
is
perfectly
clear.
where,
as
in
this
case,
it
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--because,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
congress
did
is,
it
created
a
system
under
which
the
subdivisions
underneath
the
secretary
may
not
investigate
or
act.
it's
left
to
the
secretary,
and
now
it
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect,
we...
well,
first
of
all,
the
text
of
the
statute
we
think
is
enough
on
its
face,
but
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
makes
sense,
we
think
it
does,
because...
and
i
will
point
you
to
several
other
examples
in
federal
firearms
law
where
congress
has
adopted
categorical
rules
allowing
felons
to
have
their
rights
restored.
we
believe
this
is
a
safety
valve.
we're
not
saying
that
the
secretary
has
to
grant
any
particular
application.
what
we're
saying
is
that
congress
recognized
that
there
would
be
extraordinary
cases.
what
congress
was
faced
with
was
that
atf
had
spent
$20
million
granting
3,000
applications,
and
that's
what
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
was
trying
to
cut
off.
what
we
are
describing
is
a
very
different
animal.
it
is
an
animal
that's
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
and
that
is,
the
secretary
is
still
empowered
to
grant
relief.
now,
justice
ginsburg,
one
of
the
premises
of
your
question
was
that
there's
a
delegation
here.
the
delegation
here
is
not
exclusive.
the
delegation
here
provides
that...
and
this
was
in
19...
when
the
batf
was
created,
the
secretary
provided
that
the
director
shall
act
under
the
general
supervision
of
the
secretary
and
under...
excuse
me,
and
under
the
supervision
of
the
assistant
secretary.
the
parallel
that's
drawn
by
the
solicitor
general
is
to
united
states
v.
nixon
and
to
the
accardi
case,
and
those
were
exclusive
delegations.
in
united
states
v.
nixon
this
court
said...
and
this
is
at
page
695
of
the
opinion...
that
the
special
prosecutor
had
plenary
authority,
and
the
regulation
provided
that
the
attorney
general
shall
not
interfere
with
the
special
prosecutor's
decision,
and
in
accardi,
and
this
is
at
page
266,
the
court
said
that...
the
scheme
in
accardi
was
that
the
attorney
general
would
act
only
after
the
bureau
of
immigration
affairs,
and
that
clearly
contemplated
that
the
ag
would
stay
out
of
the
process.
in
any
event,
not
only
is
this
not
an
exclusive
delegation,
but
our
fundamental
point
is
that
it's
an
illegal
delegation.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
justice
ginsburg.
here's
how
it
works.
the
statute
contemplates
when
there's
a
denial,
and
we
will
take
up,
probably,
the
question
further
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
denial
here,
but
to
focus
only
on
the
judicial
review
aspect,
when
there's
a
denial,
you
file
a
petition
with
the
federal
district
court.
what
happens
in
all
the
cases
would
be
what
happened
here,
and
that
is
that
the
district
judge
orders
the
united
states
and
the
secretary
made
the
party
defendant.
they
come
into
the
case,
and
they
have
the
opportunity
to
put
on
evidence,
to
examine
the
witnesses...
that
happened
here--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
ginsburg,
you
are
correct
what
we
asked
for.
you
are,
with
respect,
not
correct
about
what
the
government
said
in
this
case.
the
government
did
not
come
in
and
say,
our
hands
are
tied.
the
government
did
press
its
argument
that
there
wasn't
jurisdiction,
but
it
absolutely
did
participate
on
the
factual
side
of
the
case.
i
can
give
you
examples.
j.a.
51
is
the
examination
of
tommy
bean,
and
then
the
cross-examination
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
j.a.
55
is
the
opportunity
given
to
the
united
states
to
cross-examine
the
chief
of
police.
we--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no.
precisely
the
opposite.
j.a.
37
is
the
united--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--what
happened
is,
they
came
in...
i'm...
i've
confused
you
with
the
timing.
on
january
20,
199...
on
2000,
there
was
a
hearing
held
before
the
federal
district
judge,
judge
fisher.
the
united
states
participated.
it
did
not
say,
we
are
prohibited
from
participating.
they
had
been
given
the
opportunity
to
take
witnesses,
and
let
me
detour
very
briefly,
and
that
is
to
say
that
while
the
appropriations
statutes
prohibit
atf
from
acting
on
applications,
we
are
now
talking
about,
as
you've
pointed
us
to,
the
petition,
and
there
is
nothing...
and
that's
the
distinction
drawn
in
section
925(c).
atf
is
not
disabled
from
participating
in
the
district
court.
to
return.
there
was
this
hearing
on
january
20.
the
united
states
was
given
the
opportunity
to
put
on
evidence
and
cross-examine
witnesses,
as
i
was
just
describing.
immediately
afterwards,
the
respondent
bean
submitted
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
after
that
adversary
proceeding.
at
j.a.--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i'm
almost
there.
there
was.
j.a.
37
is
the
united
states'
response
to
our
proposed
findings
of
fact,
and
they
conclude
at
j.a.
37
that
our
proposed
findings
of
fact
are
supported
by
the
evidence.
finding
of
fact
27
is
that
petitioner...
that...
he...
we
were
the
petitioner
there.
petitioner,
based
on
the
circumstances
of
his
disability
and
based
on
his
record
and
reputation,
would
not
represent
a
threat
to
the
public
safety,
and
finding
of
fact
28
that
they
conceded
was
that
granting
petitioner
the
relief
he
requested
would
not
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
what
happened
here
is
that
the
evidence
was
so
overwhelming.
we
had
six
chiefs
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--because,
justice
kennedy,
nothing
in
the
appropriations
rider
prohibits
either
of
the
two
following
things:
first,
the
united
states
attorney
showing
up
and
representing
the
united
states,
relatedly
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
showing
up;
or
the
atf
participating
at
the
petition
stage,
as
opposed
to
the
application
stage.
i
think
it's
very
important
to
recognize
here
that
this
case
has
proceeded
up
until
today
on
the
understanding
of
the
parties
that
the
evidence
about
mr.
bean's
entitlement
to
relief
was
overwhelming.
six
chiefs
of
police,
a
priest,
a
local--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
[laughter]
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
our
position
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
breyer,
you
have
several
questions.
let
me
deal
with
them
in
the
following
terms:
was
there
a
denial
here,
second,
does
it
matter
whether
there
was
a
denial
here,
and
third,
is
it
sufficient
that
the
government's
position
and
interpretation
is
reasonable,
as
opposed
to
compelled
by
the
statutory
language?
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word
denial
is
a
refusal
to
grant
the
relief
requested.
our
position
is
that
when
atf
turns
around
and
sends
us
a
letter
saying,
we're
not
going
to
act,
that
is...
it's
not
a
failure
to
act,
it's
a
refusal
to
act.
that
is
a
denial,
and
i
can
point
to
their
own
regulation
that
means
it
must
be
so.
under
subsection
(i)(1)(3)
of
the
governing
regulation,
which
unfortunately
is
not
reproduced
in
any
of
the
documents...
we
do
cite
it,
i
apologize,
but
it
is
not
quoted
in
any
of
the
appendices.
under
that
provision,
atf
said
that
any
person
who
is
a
firearms
licensee...
let
me
briefly
draw
the
distinction
here,
and
that
is,
there
are
people
who
are
allowed
to
have
firearms
under
state
law,
but
there
are
federally
licensed
dealers,
importers,
collectors.
in
the
latter
class,
any
person
who
submits
an
application
to
atf
is
allowed
to
continue
operating
for
30
days,
until
30
days
after
the
denial.
if
the
government
is...
and
that's
a
quote,
of
the
denial
of
the
application.
if
the
government
is
correct
here,
it
would
make
the
profoundly...
have
the
profoundly
illogical
consequence
that
no
licensed
collector
has
ever
been
denied,
and
they
all
have
the
right
to
continue
operating.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
oh,
no,
just
the
reverse,
justice
souter.
let
me
be
clear.
the
regulation
says
that
you
get
to
keep
operating
under
your
license
until
30
days
after
the
denial.
what
i'm
saying
is,
if
you
accept
mr.
kneedler's
premise
that
all
these
letters
that
atf
has
been
sending
out
are
not
denials--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
souter,
if
the
government
is
correct...
and
i
won't
belabor
this
point.
if
the
government
is
correct
that
the
atf
letters
don't
count
as
denials,
then
every
licensed
dealer
in
the
united
states
can
continue
operating
indefinitely.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i'll
move
on,
then.
i
respectfully
disagree,
but
i...
and
i
think
the
language
will
track
in
our
direction,
but
let
me
move
on,
because
justice
breyer
had
two
subsidiary
questions.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
my
impression--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--my
impression
is
that
it's
a
form
letter
that
goes
out
to
everyone.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
now,
you...
i
had
promised
to
come
back
to
the
question
of
whether,
in
this
case,
it
matters
that
we
didn't
get
what
this
court
would
conclude
to
be
a
technical
denial
letter,
notwithstanding
if
you
accept
the
rest
of
our
argument
that
we
have
the
right
to
compel
the
secretary
to
give
us
one,
so
to
play
this
out,
our
position
is
that
the
secretary
had
the
duty
to
act.
the
question
back
to
us
is,
well,
maybe
the
secretary
didn't
act
here.
my
point
is,
that
doesn't
matter.
the
question
presented
by...
before
this
court,
if
i
could
take
you
to
it,
is
that...
is
fundamentally,
and
this
is
the
text
of
it,
whether
a
federal
district
court
has
the
authority
to
grant
relief.
the
government
has
never
contended,
again,
in
the
district
court
that
there
was
an
insufficient
premise
for
us
to
be
in
district
court.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
right...
excuse
me,
the
provision
for
judicial
review
in
section
925(c)
has
been
repealed,
and
that
takes
us
back
to
your
third
question,
justice
breyer,
or
third
subsidiary
one,
and
that
is,
is
it
enough...
and
this
is
justice
souter's
point.
isn't
it
enough
for
us
to
recognize
basically
what
congress
was
after
here,
and
i
will
turn
to
the
answer.
it
is
no.
tva
v.
hill,
will,
robertson,
many
other,
dickerson,
of
this
court's
precedents
make
perfectly
clear,
and
this
was
the
question
that
justice
scalia
started
out
with,
that
an
appropriations
repeal
has
to
be
categorical.
the
conflict
between
the
two
statutes,
section
925(c)
and
the
appropriations
law,
have
to
be
irreconcilable,
and
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
then
i
will
take
you
to
tva
v.
hill,
which
does
address
this
issue.
the
court
has
made
perfectly
clear
that
the
kind
of
legislative
history
here
is
the
kind
of
legislative
history
that
would
draw
justice
souter
and
possibly
justice
breyer
to
the
conclusion
that
we
know
basically
what
congress
was
trying
to
do.
those
are
appropriations
committee
reports,
and
this
court
could
not
have
been
more
clear
that
those
are
not
an
accurate
indicia
of
congressional
intent.
there
are--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
ginsburg,
let
me...
can
i
start
at
the
end
of
what
i
think
is
the
consequence
of
several
of
these
questions,
and
then
come
back
to
the
difference
between
administrative
review
and
judicial
review,
and
whether
this
would
just
be
unknown
to
american
law?
the
very
best
we
think
that
the
government
can
get
out
of
this
argument
is
a
judgment
of
this
court
that
says
we
were
entitled
to
a
remand
to
the
secretary.
when
we
came
to
federal
district
court
and
asked
for
relief,
the
best
the
government
could
do
was
an
order
that
says,
no,
you
should
have
acted.
what
can't
be
the
case,
we
believe,
is
that
the
secretary
would
be
able
to
just
let
these
things
pile
up
on
his
desk
and
say,
i've
never
denied
them,
tough.
now,
the...
what
we
take--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--right,
and
if
we
conclude
that's
not
a
denial,
we
can't
get
into
court.
the
government's
answer,
i
think,
if
we
move
down
the
road,
will
be
that
we
should
file
another
lawsuit,
an
apa
lawsuit
that
says,
to
compel
agency
action
unreasonably
withheld,
and
if
you
take
that
position,
if
you
conclude
that
this
is
agency
inaction
instead
of
an
agency
refusal
to
act,
the
surreply
to
that,
the
answer
is
that
you
should
treat
this
as
an
apa
action.
the
provision
that
mr.
kneedler
is
quoting
to
you,
5
u.s.c.
703,
says
that
the
form
of
an
action
under
the
apa
shall
be
the
special
review
provision
provided
by
statute,
and
that's
section
925(c).
if
we
were
required
to
file
under
the
apa
we
did.
that's--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
answer--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
the
answer
to
the
question
is
no,
and
let
me
explain
why.
[laughter]
mr.
kneedler...
thankfully.
mr.
kneedler
framed
the
question
as
whether
or
not
the
secretary
abused
his
discretion
by
not
withdrawing
the
delegation,
by
saying,
i
knew
what
congress
was
up
to,
this
is
my
agency,
i
know
how
this
thing
works.
the
answer
is
that
this
is
not
a
question
of
abuse
of
discretion.
it
is
a
question
of
a
clear
statutory
command.
section
925(c)
says,
we
can
apply
to
the
secretary,
and
clearly
contemplates
that
the
secretary
will
act
on
these
things.
it's
not
an
option.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
right
to
apply
to
the
secretary
would
remain.
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
secretary,
once
his
obligation
to
act
is
recognized,
will
set
up
standards.
he'll
say
things
like,
i'm
only
going
to
grant
relief
if
it's
an...
the
legislative
history
refers
to
a
technical
or
unintentional
violation
where
there
are
sworn
statements
in
front
of
me
that
make
perfectly
clear
this
person
is
no
threat
whatsoever.
that
will
be
up
to
the
secretary.
the
secretary
will
get
to
decide,
and
if
he's
granting
too
many
applications,
congress
will
come
along
and
say,
no
funding
under
this
or
any
other
act
shall
be
expended
to
investigate
or
act
on
appropriation,
on
925(c)
applications.
the
critical
thing,
and
the...
is
that
the
government
does
not
dispute
that
this
appropriations
rider
ever
since
1993
is
in
the
subdivision
that
applies
only
to
atf.
if
you
want
to
talk
about
congress
working,
they
need
clear
instructions.
we
can't
have
the
executive
branch
out
here
saying,
i
don't
really
like
this
statute,
and
so
i'm
going
to
infer
that
it's
been
repealed,
and
we
can't
have
the
courts
doing
that,
too.
it
will
take
no
effort
whatsoever,
if
this
is
what
congress
really
intends,
to
strip
away
the
statute
and
to
do
it
in
appropriations
law.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
we
have
a,
now,
i
think,
a
different
question
of
administrative
law,
and
that
is
the
fundamental
principle,
in
the
apa
context
or
a
parallel
like
925(c),
is
it
only
the
court
that
can
enter
the
order
saying,
you
have
a
right
to
relief?
or
does...
where's
the
proper
order,
send
it
to
the
secretary
and
saying,
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion,
it's
absolutely
clear
under
the
statute
you're
entitled
to
it.
now,
the
court
here
did
the
latter.
if
this
court
decided
that
was
technically
incorrect,
it
could
reverse
on
that
ground
and
say,
no,
no,
no,
the
correct
technical
judgment
is
to
put
it
back
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
neither
did
the
government.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
justice
scalia,
they
gave
us
what
we
asked
for.
i
apologize
for
that.
if--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--if
they
should
have--
[laughter]
if
they
should
have
done
something
else,
then
this
court
can
tell
it
so,
but
we...
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
hold
us
to
the
position
that
the
government
did
not
object,
that
only
the
secretary...
in
this
case,
when
you
go
through
the
district
court
record,
that
the
only
proper
remedy
is
an
order
to
the
secretary
to
grant
us
relief,
as
opposed
to
granting
us
relief
personally.
remember,
as
i
quoted
to
you
from
the
findings
of
fact,
the
government
left
the
playing
field
here.
it
admitted
that
with
all
of
the
evidence
we
had,
no
one
could
reasonably
dispute
that
tommy
bean
was
perfectly
entitled
and
represented
no
threat.
the
only
question...
they
participated
on
the
fact
side
of
the
case.
their
only
argument
that
they
attempted
to
advance
was
that
the
district
court
was
powerless
to
do
anything
at
all.
with
respect,
we
did
what
we
were
supposed
to
do
to
get
relief
here,
and
if
the
court
decides
that
it
only
should
have
gone
to
the
secretary,
that's
a
minor
change
in
the
judgment.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
kennedy,
let
me
be
clear
on
what
money
was
spent,
because
there
were
technical
questions
about
this.
the
united
states
attorney's
office
participated
here,
not--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--with
respect,
there
was
one
agent
who
was
one
witness.
the
appropriations
statute
says
you
may
not
investigate,
which
was
not
what
he
was
doing,
and
you
may
not
act
upon,
which
was
not
what
he
was
doing,
upon
applications,
which
this
was
not.
it
was
a
petition
under
section
925(c).
there
was
no
prohibition,
and
the
atf
agent
did
not
object
that
i'm
not
allowed
to
be
there.
we
did...
we
put
the
witnesses
on
that
we
were
supposed
to.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
he
can.
what
he
can
do
is,
he
can
take
and
is
required
to
take
up
into
his
own
hands,
as
the
three
examples
i
gave
to
justice
ginsburg,
the
responsibility.
he
can
detail.
he
has
a
budget
of
$123
million,
$141,000,
and
he
can
take
them
up
into
his
hands
and
say,
look,
i've
got
these
sworn
statements,
and
he
could
require,
i
want
10
sworn
statements.
he
could
require,
i
want
20,
and
he
can
have
someone
confirm
that
that's
the
right
person.
but
what
we
do
think,
and
this
goes
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
is
that
we
do
not
think
that
congress
contemplated
that
the
secretary
would
spend
$20
million
granting
3,000
applications.
if
he
decided--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
