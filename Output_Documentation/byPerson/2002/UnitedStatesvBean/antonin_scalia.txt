mr.
kneedler--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
call
it
a
statutory
bar.
i
thought
there
was
some
difference
in
appropriations
statutes
from
ordinary,
ordinary
laws.
are
the
two
exactly
the
same?
could
congress
create
a
substantive
obligation,
for
example,
in
an
appropriations
law,
provide
that,
oh,
i
don't
know,
nobody
shall
sell
stock
on
tuesdays?
could
they
put
that
in
an
appropriations
measure?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
think
that
that's
100
percent
clear?
i
mean,
in
robertson,
the
amendment
of
a
prior
statute
was
affected
not
by
the
simple
means
of
withholding
appropriations.
i
mean,
it
set
forth
different
language
that
was
going
to
govern
the
matter.
here,
the
only
thing
that
has
happened
is
they're
not
given
any
appropriations,
and
you
think
it
is
not
a
matter...
you
think
it's
entirely
clear
that
when
the
secretary
receives
an
application
and
says,
i
cannot
act
on
this
application
because
the
appropriations
rider
forbids
me,
do
you
think
it's
entirely
clear
that
that
does
not
amount
to
a
denial
of
the
application?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
may
be
the
better
one,
but
is
it
clear?
i
mean,
the
law
is
that
unless
you
make
it
quite
clear
in
the
appropriations
statute
that
you
are
intending
to
amend
the
prior
law,
the
prior
law
is
not
amended.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
be
a
transfer
to
another
agency
if
the
secretary
did
it
himself.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
he
gave
he
could
withdraw.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
agency
doesn't
always
have
to
make
a
record.
i
mean,
suppose
the
agency
just,
you
know,
just
makes
a
decision.
why
can't
this
court
treat
it
as
a
matter
of
review?
that
is,
the
issue
before
the
court
will
be
whether
the
action
here,
assuming
it's
a
denial,
was
unreasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
the
argument
is
that
the...
certainly
the
secretary,
and
perhaps
all
federal
officials,
don't
get
paid
by
the
hour,
they
get
paid
for
all
the
official
actions
that
they
take
during
the
year,
so
that
even
if
they
take
it
on
a
saturday
they're
being
compensated
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
minimally,
but
compensated.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
didn't
say,
denied.
he
said,
i'm
not
going
to
act
upon
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereupon,
your
remedy
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
be
to
sue
in
district
court
for
agency
action
unreasonably
withheld.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i'm
still
left
with...
assuming
all
that,
i'm
still
left
with
the
problem
that
you've
asked
for
the
court
to
make
the
decision
rather
than
asking
to
have
the
secretary
make
the
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
didn't
ask
for
it
to
be
put
back
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
the
court
had
an
obligation
to
give
you
something
you
didn't
even
ask
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
the
wrong
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask,
under
your
view
of
things
can
the
secretary
use
assistance,
or
would
that
constitute
a
delegation?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
when
congress
says
we
give
$500,000
to
subunit
b
to
perform
this
function,
you
cannot
use
$2
million
from
somewhere
else
to
perform
the
same
function.
that's
one
thing.
it's
something
quite
different,
however,
to
say
that
when
you
have
forbidden
one
unit
from
doing
something,
and
there
is
a
general
statute
which
allows
the
secretary
to
do
it,
that
that
prohibition
also
applies
to
the
secretary.
i
just
don't
think
it's
parallel.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
has
a
statutory
obligation
to
perform
the
function--
