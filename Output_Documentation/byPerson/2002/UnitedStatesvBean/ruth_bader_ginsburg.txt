justice

bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
there
was
an
alternate
argument
that
a
foreign
conviction
shouldn't
count
for
this
purpose.
has
the
united
states
ever
taken
a
position
on
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
kneedler,
if
we
shift
the
focus
from
the
agency
to
the
court,
is
it
your
essential
argument
that
congress
provided
for
an
appellate,
essentially
an
appellate
role
for
the
district
court
and
not
a
first
instance
role?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
the
only
authority
the
court
would
have
would
be
to
review
a
decision
made
by
an
executive
official,
but
there
is
a
provision
in
this
law
for
the
district
court
to
take
additional
evidence.
usually
when
a
court
is
performing
a
review
function
it
doesn't
take
any
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein,
may
i
back
you
up
just
a
bit,
because
i'm
looking
at
the
letter
you
cited.
it
is
addressed
to
the
secretary,
but
it's
care
of
director
of
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms,
and
congress
passes
all
kinds
of
laws
giving
the
secretary
authority
to
do
this
or
that,
which
the
secretary
invariably
delegates,
and
i
can't
think
of
an
instance
where
a
regime
of
this
order
is
taken
over
by
the
secretary
herself,
rather
than
by
some
delegatee,
but
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that's
made
to
order
for,
not
the
top
person,
but
for
it
to
be
delegated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
first
question
started
out,
it
seems
that
you
in
the
beginning
of
this
process
understood
that
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco,
and
firearms
was
the
relevant
actor,
because
you
addressed
the
secretary
care
of
that
agency,
not
the
secretary--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein,
i
would...
you
are
concentrating
on
the
agency
end
of
it.
looking
at
it
from
the
perspective
of
a
court,
you
seem
to
be
making
of
the
district
court
an
entity
that
doesn't
exist
in
the
u.s.
system.
you're
having
the
district
court
in
effect
being
an
examining
magistrate.
there
is
no
adverse
party.
you're
having
the
district
court
determine
whether
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
warrant
restoring
the
license.
we
don't
have
district
judges
performing
that
kind
of
mixed
function,
proceeding
in
that
ex
parte
way.
it
would
be
extraordinary
for
congress
to
make
such
a
provision,
and
yet
you
want
us
to
infer
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
united
states
came
in
and
said,
we
are
disabled.
congress
doesn't
want
us
to
play
a
part
in
that.
it
seems
to
me
then
the...
you
fight
that
out,
and
if
the
agency
isn't
disabled,
the
district
court
orders
the
agency
to
act.
but
that's
not
what
you
asked
for.
you
asked
the
district
court
to
restore
this
person's
license,
and
that's
the
relief
you
got.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
united
states
take
the
position
that
this
license
shouldn't
be
restored?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
how
there
was
an
adversary
proceeding,
then.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
what
sense
it
was
adversary?
usually,
if
the
bureau
hadn't
been
disabled
by
congress
it
would
say,
deny
an
application,
and
then
there
would
be
a
determination
on
the
merits,
but
here,
apparently
there
was
no
position
taken
on
the
merits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein,
before
we
get
into
legislative
history
and
how
it
bears
on
this,
i
see
congress
having
established
traditional
roles
where
the
executive
was
going
to
be
the
investigator,
the
court
was
going
to
be
the
reviewer.
the
agency
says,
we
have
no
authority
to
act.
when
a
court
says,
we
don't
have
authority
to
act,
it's
not
granting
or
denying
the
relief
requested,
so
isn't
that
the
proper
way
to
look
at
what
the
agency
is
doing?
when
it
says,
we
have
no
authority
to
act,
it
isn't
granting
or
denying.
and
then
on
the
court,
the
court
said,
congress
set
us
up
to
be
a
court
of
review,
not
first
view.
the
agency
hasn't
looked
at
it
because
it
says
it
has
no
authority
to
do
it.
congress
did
not
give
us
the
authority,
ever,
to
take
a
first
view
of
this.
