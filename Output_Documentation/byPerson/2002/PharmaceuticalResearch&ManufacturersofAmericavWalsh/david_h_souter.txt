justice
david
h.
souter
--but
if
you
take
that
position,
the
state
plan
could
be
rendered
meaningless.
i
mean,
the
state
plan
simply
becomes
a
kind
of
formal
open
sesame.
the...
there's
got
to
be
power
to
look,
as
justice
scalia
suggests,
or
the
state
plan
means
nothing.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
what
about
the
halfway
measure,
and
the
halfway
measure
has
been
described
by
the
government
as...
as
some
instances
of
prior
approval
that,
that
it
would
authorize
that
go
beyond
what
the...
the...
the...
the
very
strict
enforcement
of
medicaid
in
a
limited
sense
would
require.
do
you
think
what
the
government
has...
excuse
me.
do
you
think
what
the
government
has
suggested
is
also
beyond
the
authorization
of
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
that
a--
--a
problem
with
the
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
well...
no,
let
me
yield
to
justice
kennedy.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
west
lynn
creamery
difficulty
in
your
argument
that
here,
unlike
west
lynn,
there
are
no
entities
within
the
same
category,
manufacturers,
e.g.,
producers,
for
example,
some
of
whom
are
being
discriminated
in
favor
of
others?
what's
going
on
here
is
not
discrimination
by
the
state
within
a
given
class
to
benefit
the
members
of
the
class
within
the
state.
what
is
going
on
here
is
a
scheme
which
happens
to
fall
on
certain
individuals
in
a
manufacturing
class
who,
incidentally,
are
out
of
state,
for
the
benefit
of
people
in
a
different
class,
that
is,
the
consumers,
who
are
in-state,
and
west
lynn
doesn't
govern
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
is...
i
mean,
that's
a...
that's
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
prior
approval
scheme.
that...
you're
going
to
have
that
argument
no...
no
matter
how...
no
matter
how
prior
approval--
justice
david
h.
souter
--simply
because
you've
got
to
have
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
why
doesn't
the
secretary
do
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
i
think
the
secretary
is
ignoring
one
serious
problem,
and
i
suspect
it's
behind
justice
scalia's
question.
it's
certainly
in
my
mind.
it's
one
thing
for
the
secretary
to
act
within
enforcement
power.
it's
one
thing
for
the
secretary
to
interpret
the
regs
by,
the
statute
by
regulations
that
are
subject
to
chevron
deference,
but
if
the
secretary
does
neither
one
of
those
things,
and
from
one
side
of
the
secretary's
mouth
we
hear,
well,
yes,
some
prior
approval
beyond
what
is
strictly
necessary
for
the
direct
benefit
of
medicaid
recipients
is
okay,
but
this
goes
a
little
bit
goes
too
far,
courts
are
then
placed
in
the
position
of
saying,
well,
can
we
read
the
statute
so
precisely
as
to
say
that
the
secretary's
position
of
what
is
okay
is
okay
and,
by
going
this
step
further,
there's
a
violation
of
the
statute?
we
are
placed
in
a
very
difficult
position,
in
effect
by
the
secretary,
by
you,
in
being
asked
to
draw
a
line
with
a
very
fine
pencil,
whereas
if
the
secretary
wants
to
act
under
administrative
authority,
presumably
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
ah.
