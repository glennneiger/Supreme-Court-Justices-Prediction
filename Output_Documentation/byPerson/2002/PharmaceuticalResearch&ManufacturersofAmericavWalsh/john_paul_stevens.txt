justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
this
question:
could
the
state,
if
it
just...
without
adopting
a
maine
rx
program,
just
decide,
we
want
to
take
a
good,
hard
look
at
every
sale
of
drugs
that
comes
into
our
state,
so
we're
going
to
subject
every
drug
manufacturer
to
prior
approval
pursuant
to
1396r-8(d),
could
they
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
do
have
that
authority,
and
you
say
that's
an
open
question,
doesn't
it
follow,
a
fortiori,
that
they
can
do
what
they're
doing
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
my
hypothetical
was
completely
unrelated.
they
just
want
to
be
sure
you
can
open
the
caps
on
the
drug
containers,
or
whatever
it
might
be,
some
idiocentric...
i
don't
think
that
the...
as
i
read
it,
i
don't
see
anything
in
that
provision
that
says
it
must
serve
a
medicaid
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
phillips,
are
there
any
findings
that
any
medicaid
recipient
has
actually
been
harmed
by
this
program?
i...
this
is
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--one
of
the
things
that
bothers
me,
i
don't
know
that
we
have
any
findings
by
the
district
court
as
to
what
the
real
impact
will
be.
i
know
your...
your...
the
government
says
this
is
going
to
happen--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
if
everybody
agreed,
for
example,
to
join
the
maine
program,
maybe
it
may
work
out
fine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
may
well
be
that
prior
authorization
would,
in
turn,
lead
to
some
solution
between
the
drug
companies
and
the
state
as
to
how
this
will
all
be
handled.
i
don't
think
the
fact
they
agreed
that
it
would
trigger
prior
authorization
necessarily
proves
the
conclusion
that
the
medicaid
recipients
will
be
harmed.
it
may
well
be
true,
but
i'm
just
not
sure--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
record
supports
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
of
this
stage
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
only
opposes
the
very
threat
that
the
statute
by
its
own
terms
authorizes.
that's
the
threat.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
threat
of
prior
approval
which
the
statute
authorizes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
kneedler,
it
is...
it
is
at
least
theoretically
possible
that
the
secretary
could
approve
this
very
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
of
course.
it
needs
more
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
it
may
have
now
advanced
a
medicaid-related
purpose
that
may
or
may
not
be
sufficient.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
couldn't
that
procedure
be
followed
by
affirming,
and
saying
there
should
be
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
on
these
very
issues
that
you're
raising,
and
both
sides
would
present
the
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
read
the
statutory
authorization
for
prior
approval
to
mean
prior
approval
only
if
there's
a
medicaid-related
benefit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
rely
entirely
on
legislative
history
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
real
question
is
whether
it
has
an
unstated
limitation
that's
sufficiently
clear
that
it
preempts
the
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
real
question
is
whether
the
unstated
limitation
is
sufficiently
clear
to
be
preemptive
of
a
state
statute
to
the
contrary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
this
question:
i
thought
you
would
agree
that,
if
it
were
clear
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
this
program
was
going
to
harm
medicaid
recipients,
that
we
would
have
power
to
enjoin
the
program?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
an
unresolved
factual
question
whether,
in
fact,
these
adverse
consequences
would
follow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
may
not
agree
with
that
statement,
but
at
least
they
have
to
make
a
showing
there
in
fact
will
be
an
adverse
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
brief
question,
i
don't...
i'm
worried
about
your
time,
but
is
it
inconceivable
to
say
that
there
was
no
showing
at
the
time
of
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing
but
now
they...
maine
says
they
can
make
the
showing
that
they
should
have
made
before.
should
the
judge
not
listen
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
in
response
to
rising
medicaid
expenditures
in
the
1970s
and
1980s
several
states
began
to
experiment
what
were
known
as
prior
authorization
programs.
these
programs
require
a
state
agency
to
approve
a
doctor's
prescription
prior
to
the
prescription
being
filled
in
order
to
get
reimbursement
under
the
state's
medicaid
program.
building
on
the
states
lead
in
1990,
congress
amended
the
medicaid's
statute
to
grade
its
on
prescription
drug
rebate
program.
one
part
of
its
new
program
allowed
states
as
a
condition
of
coverage
of
payment
for
a
covered
outpatient
drug
to
require
approval
of
the
drug
before
it
was
dispense
so
long
as
two
safety
requirements
are
met.
those
requirements
that
there
will
be
a
response
by
telephone
or
other
communication
device
within
24
hours
of
a
request
per
prior
authorization,
and
two,
except
for
certain
excludable
drugs
there
is
at
least
72-hour
supply
of
a
covered
drug
will
be
dispensed
in
an
emergency
situation.
in
the
year
2000,
maine
enacted
the
maine
rx
program
which
is
primarily
intended
to
provide
discounted
prescription
drugs
to
maine's
uninsured
resident
that
is
actually
opens
to
all
residents
of
the
state.
under
the
program,
maine
will
attempt
to
negotiate
rebates
with
drug
manufacturers
to
fund
a
reduced
price
for
the
drugs
offered
to
maine
rx
participants.
if
a
drug
company
does
not
enter
into
a
rebate
agreement,
its
medicaid
sales
will
be
subjected
to
a
prior
authorization
procedure.
after
the
passage
of
the
statute
establishing
maine
rx
but
before
the
program
actually
went
into
effect,
petitioner,
an
association
representing
manufacturer's
that
account
for
more
than
75%
of
brand
name
drug
sales
in
the
united
states,
filed
suit
challenging
the
validity
of
the
maine
statute.
petitioner
asserted
that
maine
rx
is
preempted
by
the
medicaid
statute
and
that
it
violates
a
negative
commerce
clause.
the
district
court
sustained
both
challenges
and
entered
a
preliminary
injunction
preventing
implementation
of
the
statute.
the
first
circuit
reversed
and
we
granted
certiorari.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
vacating
the
district
court's
preliminary
injunction.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
and
justice
ginsburg
join
in
full,
and
in
which
justice
breyer
joins
as
to
all
except
one
part;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
the
judgment
as
has
justice
thomas;
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined.
