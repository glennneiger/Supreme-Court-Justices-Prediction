justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips,
that...
that
provision
is...
is
in
the
portion
of
the
statute
dealing
with
the
approval
of
the
state
plan,
a
state
plan
has
to
have
that
consequence.
it
has
to
serve
the
interest
of
the
medicaid
recipients.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
that
each...
each...
each
feature
enacted
by
a
state
has
to
be
judged
individually
under
that
standard.
it
seems
to
me,
why
isn't
it
the
case
that
if...
if
a
state
adopts
some
provision
which
does
not
comply
with
that
provision,
its
plan
is
no
longer
a
conforming
plan,
and
the
secretary
has
explicit
authority
under
the
statute
to...
to
repeal
the
secretary's
prior
approval
of
the
plan.
why
isn't
that
the
way
this
thing
should
work?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
how
can
the
authorization
provision
and
the
requirements
attached
to
the
authorization
provision,
how
can
that
conceivably
not
be
part
of
the
state
plan,
as
you
say?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it's
central
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there's
an
authorization--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
the
way
primary
jurisdiction
works?
i
thought
there
has
to
be
in
place
some
mechanism
for
getting
the
agency
to
pass
upon
the
question,
a
mechanism
that
the
person
who
is
dismissed
from
federal
court
is
entitled
to
use,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
exists
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
even
if
you
sit
on
it
until
it's
done--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
still
have
to
assure
that
there's
some...
some
mechanism.
i
mean,
all
the
primary
jurisdiction
cases
i
know
of,
there...
there
was
a
means
to
file
a
case
before
the
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
just
send
them
off
and
say,
you
know,
ask
the
secretary,
by
the
way,
and
have
the
secretary
write
us
a
letter.
i
don't
know
that
we've
ever
done
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips,
as
i
understand
your
position,
so
long
as
it
benefits
medicaid
recipients,
any...
any
authorization
scheme
is
okay?
i
mean,
a
state
can
say,
we'll
authorize
your
drug
if
you
pay
$5
to
each
medicaid
recipient?
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you...
you
may
be
up
in
a...
in
a
later
case
arguing
that
the...
that
the
reasonable
reading
of
the
authorization
requirement
is...
is
to
assure
the
safety
of
the
drug,
or
the
necessity
of
the
drug
for
the
particular
illness?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
hasn't
the
secretary
acted
under
it,
then?
what
are
you
bothering
us
for?
if
the
secretary
has
power
under
this...
under
this
regulation
to
stop
this
plan
from
going
forward
because
it
amounts
to
an
amendment
of
the...
of
the
plan,
and
an
amendment
that
hasn't
been
approved,
the...
the
secretary
has
the
power
to
stop
it.
why...
you
know,
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
we
have
to
get
involved?
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that's
one
of
the
valid
uses
of
the
authorization
provision?
you
think
that's
why
it
was
included
in
the
statute,
so
that
a
state
could...
could
shake
down
drug
companies
to
lower
prices
to
other
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
use
it
for
anything
at
all?
could...
could
you
use
it
to...
to
say,
we...
you
know,
you...
you
have
to
pay
each
member
of
the
maine
legislature
$100
a
year?
could...
could
you
put
that
in
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
assume
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
and
money
for
us
to
send
it
back
to
the
secretary,
at
least
if
we
are
convinced
on
the
basis
of
the
briefs
submitted
here,
that
even
if
the
secretary
did
approve
it,
that
approval
would
be
invalid.
i
mean,
you
would
concede
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
whatever
primary
jurisdiction
is
involved
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
certainly
makes
no
sense
to
send
it
back
to
the
secretary
if,
when
the
secretary
approves
it,
there
is
then
a
lawsuit
and
we
say,
oh,
by
the
way,
he
couldn't
approve
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
goes
too
far.
we
might
as
well
decide
that
now,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
take
that
to
be
a
yes?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
keep
all
of
their
drugs
off
unless
they
give
you
what
you
want
for
some
of
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could,
that's...
and...
and
you
say
it...
that
the
statute
envisions
using
this
authorization
as
a
cost-saving
measure.
does
this
save
any
costs...
does
this
statute
save
any
cost
to
the
medicare
recipients?
justice
antonin
scalia
to...
to
the
medicaid--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
understand,
because
some
people
won't
come
into
the
program
who
otherwise
would
come
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
i've
known
some
silly
administrators.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
point
is,
he
could
do
it.
the
point
is,
he
could...
you're...
you're...
you're...
you're
troubled
by
a...
by
a
statute
which
would
allow
a
denial
of
authorization
unless
the
drug
company
pays
$100
to
each
member
of
the...
of
the
legislature.
i...
i
gather
you...
you
acknowledge
that...
that
the
authorization
requirement
in
the
statute
has
some
unstated
limitation
upon
it,
or
don't
you
acknowledge
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
authorization
provision
have
some
unstated
limitation
upon
it,
a
limitation
that
is
not
in
that
sole
provision
alone?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't,
so
$100
to
each
legislator
is
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
the
state
passes
a
law
that
says
that
each
medicaid
beneficiary
shall
pay
an
additional
tax
of
$50
a
year.
you
say
that
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
that
law,
which
would
certainly
contravene
the...
the
whole
purpose
of
medicaid.
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
it
is
to
go
to
the
secretary
and
say,
since
this
law
is
an
amendment
of
the
state's
plan,
you
should
approve
it,
it
requires
your
approval.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
couldn't
strike
that
down
as
just
being
contrary
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
the
only
remedy
for
something
that
is
contrary
to
the
statute
is
not
going
through
the
secretary,
that
some
things
that
are
contrary
to
the
statute
can
be
attacked
directly,
as
is
being
done
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
that's
a
different
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
merits
question,
rather
than
whether
we
have,
you
know,
power
to...
to
move
at
all,
so
long
as
the
secretary
can
handle
the
problem
by
denying
approval.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you...
i
thought
you
had
acknowledged
that
the
authorization
requirement
must
not
merely
not
harm
medicaid
recipients,
but
that
the
authorization
must
serve
the
purpose
of
helping
medicaid
recipients.
don't...
don't...
don't
you
acknowledge
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
were
saying
it
does
help
them,
you
know,
and
you're
mentioning
the
ways
in
which
it
helps
the
medicaid
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
think
that's
necessary?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
