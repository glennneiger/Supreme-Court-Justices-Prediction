--administrative
regulations,
one
of
the
things
that
maine
said
was,
you've
stopped
us
at
the
threshold.
we
could
have
regulations
that
say,
for
example,
people
who
are
covered
by
insurance
will
not
have
access
to
this
benefit,
but
on
the
question...
you
said
would...
you
would
be
content
if
the
court
said,
the
secretary
has
to
look
at
it,
until
then
it's
no
good.
would
you
have...
this
is
the...
your
lawsuit.
could
you
have
gone
to
the
secretary
and
say,
said,
secretary,
we
want
you
to
look
at
this,
the
secretary
says,
i'm
busy
with
a
dozen
other
things
and
i
don't
want
to
look
at
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
the
secretary,
you
said
that
the...
at
least
the
sg
supports
your
view
that
this...
that
this
program
of
maine's
is
impermissible,
but
the
sg
also
told
us,
essentially,
that
this
case
wasn't
ripe,
so
we
shouldn't
have
granted
cert.
i
mean,
that
was
the
sg's
first
position,
that
this
is
a...
we
don't
know
what,
in
fact,
the
maine
scheme
is,
because
it
was
never...
it
never
went
into
effect,
because
you
got
an
injunction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
it...
it
was
the
government's
first
position
that
this
court
ought
to
let
the
case
ripen,
and
now
you...
you
are
necessarily
taking
a
position
in
this
lawsuit
because
we
granted
cert,
but
the
government
made
a
pretty
good
argument
essentially
that
this
case
wasn't
ripe.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
doesn't
that
depend
on
who
you
make
the
deals
with?
maybe
the
more
expensive
drug...
drugs
we're
willing
to
make
this
deal
with
you,
and
the
less
expensive
not
willing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
suppose--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
of
the
proposed
regulations,
is
anything
published?
there
was
nothing
before
either
court
about
how
this
would
be
implemented,
was
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
the
district
court?
