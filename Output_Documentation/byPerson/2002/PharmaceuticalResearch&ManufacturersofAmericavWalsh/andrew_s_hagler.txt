mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
people
without
insurance
are
charged
more
for
prescription
drugs
than
any
other
purchaser
in
the
market,
often
much
more.
patients
who
are
forced
to
pay
cash
at
the
pharmacy
are
those
least
able
to
absorb
these
high
prices.
to
ameliorate
this
hardship,
the
maine
legislature
will
embrace
a
market-based
approach
used
by
other
large
third
party
purchasers
to
leverage
its
purchasing
power
under...
as
a
third
party
purchaser
in
medicaid
to
obtain
price
relief
for
the
uninsured
in
maine.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
i
concede
that...
that
congress
never
thought
that
maine
might
use
prior
authorization
in
the
way
that
maine
rx
anticipates
it.
however,
what
congress
said--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--as
you
get
further
and
further
for
the
purposes
of...
of
providing
health
care,
you
approach
uses
a...
of
prior
authorization
that
might
offend
congress
and
this
court,
but
preemption
is
a
question
for
congress.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
we
did
not
so
argue
in
the
district
court.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
well,
it's...
it's
those
without
insurance.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
if...
we
anticipate
22
percent.
the
aarp
has
a
different--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--and
you
don't
know--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--well,
here's
the
difference
between
what
the
secretary
approved
and
what
the
maine...
and...
and
what
he's
proposing
with
respect
to
maine
rx
and
the
plan
amendments.
what
the
secretary
approved
was
a
program
that's
a
demonstration
project,
a
waiver
program,
allowing
more
people
into
medicaid
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they're
ineligible.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
approved
and
struck
down
by
the
d.c.
circuit
on
christmas
eve.
the
secretary
and
the
solicitor
general,
the
secretary
and
the
solicitor
general
identified
the
fact
that
that
program
helped
people
up
to
300
percent
of
poverty.
without
the
healthy
maine
program,
the
demonstration
project,
maine
rx
is
now
the
only
program
that
helps
those
people.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
well,
the
secretary
is
suggesting
that
the
state
of
maine
seek
a
plan
amendment,
but
by
definition,
a
plan
amendment
allows...
a
plan
amendment
is
something
that,
if
we
sought
a
plan
amendment
to
run
maine
rx
it
would
necessarily
be
allowed
by
the
medicaid
statute.
42...
the
medicaid
statute,
1396
subsection--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--we
don't--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--well,
if
the
secretary
were
to--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--it's
not
what
you're
supposed
to
decide.
the
secretary
has
not
acted,
other
than
speaking
to
this
court
through
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general.
the
medicaid
statute
provides
a
mechanism
for
the
secretary
to
tell
the
state
when
it
is
running
its
medicaid
program
in
a
fashion
which
violates
the
provisions
of
the
medicaid
statute.
that
is--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--it's
an
entirely
different...
correct,
it's
an
entirely
different
statute.
we
don't
believe
we
need
a
plan
amendment
to
seek
approval
to
run
the
maine
rx
program.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
but
you
should
not
decide
that
now.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
not
precisely.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
okay.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
yes.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
i
believe
that's
what
i--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--well--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--the
question
that
this...
the
first
question
that
this
court
certified
was,
as
described
in
the
secretary's
brief,
is
whether
the
federal
medicaid
statute
allows
the
use
of
that
authority
under
the
statute
to
compel...
the
prior
authorization
authority--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--and
he
says
yes.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
if
the--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--if
the--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--right.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
you
can
decide
the
preemption
question
now,
and
i
think
that
the
court
should,
and
the
preemption
question
is
whether
congress
intended
to
prohibit
what
maine
has
here
done.
when
congress
legislates
against
the
backdrop
of
the
preemption
doctrine
and
it
give...
gave
to
the
state
the
discretion
to
subject
to
prior
authorization
any
covered
outpatient
drug,
it
qualified
that
discretion
hardly
at
all.
the
only
qualifications
are
the
two
provisions,
the
procedural
safeguards
that
require
that
if
prior
authorization
is
sought--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--it's
congress'
business--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--to
set
the
line--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--what
congress
enacted
was
the
opportunity
for
the
secretary
to
tell
the
state
that
when
it's
begun
a
program
or
is
operating
its
medicaid
program
out
of
compliance
with
the
medicaid
statute,
that
it
believes
that
that's
the
case,
and
the
provision
provides
for
a
fair
hearing
for
the
state,
we
get
together
with
the
secretary,
we
try
to
work
it
out.
if
we
can't,
and
if
the
secretary...
if
maine
persists
in
wanting
to
run
the
program,
and
the
secretary
disapproves
the
program,
then
his
remedy
is
to
withhold
money
from
the
state
and--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--what
he
can
do
is
look
to
the
effect
of
what
happens
once
maine
rx
is
implemented,
and
look
to
the
effect
on
the
medicaid
beneficiaries
as
to
whether
or
not
they'll
be
harmed.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
oh,
i
submit
there...
that
there's...
i
disagree
with
respect
to
the
record.
i
believe
that
there's
very
little
in
the
record
which
demonstrates
that
there
will
be
any
harm
to
maine
rx
beneficiaries,
harm
to
their
health,
once
maine
rx
is
imposed,
and
should
the
state
ultimately
impose
prior
authorizations
under
the
maine
rx
statute.
you
have
lodging
materials
which
are
untested.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
if
we
were
to
return
to
the
district
court
we
could
demonstrate,
based
on
a
vigorous
use
of
prior
authorization
in
the
2
years
that
have
intervened
the
granting
of
the
injunction
and
today,
that
we
are
imposing
prior
authorization
and
we
are
answering
the
phone
in
less
than
2
hours,
and
that
medicaid
patients
are,
in
fact,
not
being
harmed.
we...
our
position
is
that
to
survive
a
facial
challenge
the
petitioner
must
demonstrate
that
any
use
of
prior
authorization,
as
contemplated
by
the
maine
rx--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--no,
and...
and
what
the
first
circuit
didn't
know
was
how
the
program
would
actually
be
implemented,
and
there
are
many
ways
of
implementing
the
program
that
not
only
will
not
cause
harm
to
medicaid
beneficiaries,
but
which
will
affirmatively
advance
the
purposes
of
medicaid.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
it
is
not,
and
the
reason
that
it's
not
is
because
the--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--we
do
have
current
experience
with
the
use
of
prior
authorization
to
save
medicaid
money.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
for
medicaid,
correct,
and
as
a
result
of
that
experience
we
know
much
more
about
our
abilities
and
would
be
able
to
describe
to
the
district
court
much
more
about
our
abilities
should
the
first
circuit--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--the
mandate
was
stayed
pending--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
so
we've...
we've
not
had
an
opportunity
to
implement
the
program.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
well--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--well,
the
federal
government
agrees
that
prior
authorization...
prior
authorization
is
undeniably
a
cost-saving
measure.
that's
the
primary
purpose
why
congress
permitted
the
states
broad
discretion
to
impose
prior
authorization.
under
the
maine
rx
program,
what
the
state
is
saying
to
manufacturers
is,
please
negotiate
with
us,
and
if
you
don't
negotiate
with
us,
we
will
review
the
drugs
that
you
manufacture
to
see
and
determine,
on
a
drug-by-drug
basis,
whether
it
would
be
appropriate
to
subject
those
drugs
to
prior
authorization.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
i
believe
that
you're
wrong.
i
believe
that...
that
the
secretary
has
the
discretion--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--yeah,
i
believe--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--i
believe--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--as
to
the...
i
believe
that
our
administrative
rules
demonstrate,
proposed
administrative
rules
that
the
department
hasn't
enacted
because
the
injunction
has
been
imposed
allow
the
department
of
human
services
of
the
state
of
maine
to
look
on
a
drug-by-drug
basis
as
to
whether
any
particular
drug
ought
to
be
subjected
to
prior--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--what
will
happen
is,
if--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--in
other
words,
if
pfizer
were
to
agree
to
provide
a
rebate
for
some
of
its
drugs
but
not
all
of
its
drugs,
must
we
look
to
the
other
drugs--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--and
determine
prior
authorization?
the
statute
contemplates
a
negotiation.
the
commissioner
is
to
use
his
best
efforts
to
negotiate
with
manufacturers
in
order
to--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
we
could,
but
the
statute
also
allows
us
not
to.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
the
purpose
of
that--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--to
the
medicare?
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
oh,
the
medicaid
recipients,
the
medicaid
recipients
themselves
pay
nothing,
but
it
can
save
money
in,
and
it's
probable
that
it
will
save
money
in
the
medicaid
program,
and
the
reason
for
that--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--well,
that's
what
the
first
circuit
picked
up
on,
but
the
other
reason
and
the
other
method
in
which
it
would
save
medicaid
money
is,
it
would
result
in
shifting
prescribing
behavior
from
more
expensive
drugs
to
less
expensive
drugs.
the
commissioner,
under
subsection--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--subsection
13
of
the
maine
rx
statute
gives
to
the
commissioner
the
discretion
to
run
the
medicaid
program
and
the
maine
rx
program
in
a
coordinated
manner
so
as
to
enhance
efficiencies
in
both,
and
so
i
believe
that
the
commissioner
would
never
impose
prior
authorization
on
the
cheapest
drug
in
a
therapeutic
class
even
if
that
manufacturer
didn't
provide
a
maine
rx
rebate,
because
it
would
be
silly
to
do
so.
he's
got
a
budget
to
operate.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
i
believe
that...
that
under
the
court's
preemption
analysis
we
look
to
the
primary
purposes
of
the
medicaid
statute
and
you
seek
to
determine
what
congress
intended.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
i
believe
that
it
doesn't,
but
even
if
it
does--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--and...
and...
and
when
that
offends
congress,
congress
has
the
ability
to
act.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
i'm
sorry.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
that's...
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
the
language
of
the
statute
is,
a
state
may
subject
to
prior
authorization
any
covered
outpatient
drug.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
every--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--indeed,
every
outpatient
drug
could
be
subjected
to
prior
authorization.
that,
too,
would
be
silly,
but
the
power
is
that
broad.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
well,
we...
we
disagree
that--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--that
it
will
not
hurt
people.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
right.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
because
the
secretary
can
act
if
the
injunction...
if
the
first
circuit's
decision
is
affirmed,
the
secretary
can
act,
and
tell
the
state
of
maine
we
believe
that
you
will
harm
medicaid
beneficiaries
and
we
will
take
your
money
away.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
but
the
secretary
hasn't
acted.
the
secretary
asked
this
court
to
approve
his
notions
of
what
maine
rx
might
look
like
if
it
were
more
limited
in
scope
in
terms
of
the
number
of
beneficiaries,
but
he
hasn't
defined
for
the
court
how
to
set
the
line.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
now,
there--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--no,
it's
contrary
to
the
statute.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
medicaid
beneficiaries
can't
be
required
to
pay
more
than
a
nominal
co-pay.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
congress
thought--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--but...
but
i'm
not
convinced
that
from
the
text
of
the
statute
you
can
find
an
intent--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--on
the
part
of
congress
to
prohibit
this,
and
even
if
it
were
to...
congress
were
to
prohibit
using
maine
rx
like
prior
authorizations
for
some
purpose
wholly
unrelated
to
health
care,
when
you
get
closer
and
closer
to
something
approaching
what
the
secretary
in
fact
does
approve
of,
how
can
a
court
set
the
line?
the
question
really
is--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--the
secretary
has
indicated
that
he'll
handle
the
problem,
or
he's
expressed
his
views
about
what
the
program
is.
the
court
should
wait
to
see
whether
the...
i
mean,
the
court
should
allow
the
secretary
to--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--yes,
but
it's
not...
i
do
agree
with
that.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
that's
correct.
we
have...
there's
no
facts
in
the
record,
and...
and
this...
this
is
a
facial
challenge
in
which
my
colleague
has
to
demonstrate
that
they
are
in
no
way...
there's
no
possibility
of
implementing
the
program
in
a
way
which
doesn't
cause
harm
to--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--some
showing.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
and
the
only
showing
that
the
district
court
seized
upon
is
this
notion
that,
by
definition,
prior
authorization
imposes
some
sort
of
procedural
impediment
to
free
access
to
all
drugs
on
behalf
of
medicaid
patients,
but
the--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--our--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--under
either
test
we
think
we
win.
under
the
first
test,
the
question
should
be,
did
congress
intend
to
prohibit
what
maine
has
here
done?
if
the
question
is,
does
the
maine
rx
program
advance
the
purposes
of
medicaid--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--it
assuredly
does
that.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
i'm...
i'm
not
convinced
that
that's
necessary.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
but
even
if
it
were
necessary,
there's...
the...
the
fact's
in
the
record,
and
the
reasonable
expectation
of
how
the
program
will
work
will
yield
medicaid
cost
savings
both
by
imposing
prior
authorization
on
drugs
that
are
more
expensive
than
their
therapeutic
equivalents,
and
also
by
making
maine...
allowing
people
without
insurance
in
the
state
of
maine
to
purchase
their
prescription
drugs
and
become
less
likely
to
become
disabled
and
financially
eligible
for
medicaid.
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
there
were
proposed
regulations.
they
are
in
the
appendix.
they
have
not
been
promulgated.
they
were
drafted,
and
they're--
mr.
andrew
s.
hagler
--yes.
they
were
handed
up
to
the
district
court,
and
they...
they
should
be
in
the
court
file.
they...
they
are
found
on
page
278
of
the
appendix,
and
that
provision
describes
how
maine
will
go
about
reviewing
the
drugs
for
prior
authorization.
if
a
manufacturer
refuses
to
participate
in...
in
a
maine
rx
negotiation,
then
the
commissioner
will
hand
a
list
of...
of
that
manufacturer's
drugs
to
a
committee
of
physicians
and
pharmacists
who
will
determine
whether
it's
clinically
appropriate
to
subject
those
drugs
to
prior
authorization,
guided
constantly
by
the
principle
that
the
purpose
of
medicaid
is
to
provide
necessary
medical
assistance
to
those
in
need.
