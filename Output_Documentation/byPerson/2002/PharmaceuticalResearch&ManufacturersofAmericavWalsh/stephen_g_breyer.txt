justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
possible...
i
mean,
as
i'm
seeing
this
at
the
moment,
if
the
state
uses
the
authorization
program
for
any
purpose
at
all,
we
know
that
some...
that
some
medicaid
recipients
will
be
hurt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
a
medicaid
recipient
walks
into
a
drugstore
and
asks
for
drug
x,
that
recipient
can
get
it
more
easily
if
it's
not
on
this
prior
approval
list
than
if
it
is,
and
that
being
so,
it
must
be
impermissible
under
federal
law,
unless
the
object
of
the
program
achieves
a
medicaid-related
purpose,
so
the
question
in
front
of
us
is,
does
it?
now,
what's
bothering
me
about
that
is
that
the
secretary
thinks
some
programs
like
maine's
are
okay,
and
others
maybe
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
my
mind
the
words,
primary
jurisdiction,
suddenly
flash
red.
how
can
i
decide
this
case
without
knowing
what
the
secretary
thinks,
and
how
can...
i
mean,
after
all,
if
the
secretary
says
this
one
is
okay,
that
would
have
a
big
leg
up
under
chevron,
and
if
the
secretary
says
no,
it
wouldn't,
so
why
isn't
the
correct
principle
primary
jurisdiction,
which
we
can
apply
whether
the
parties
like
it
or
not,
and
why
isn't
the
correct
result
here
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
and
say,
district
court,
maine
cannot
put
this
into
effect
until
they
ask
the
secretary
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
really...
that's
not
what
i
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
disagree
with
it,
so
we'll
have
to
work
it
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
their
views
the
secretary's
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'll...
fine,
i'll
ask
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
they
may
not
be
doing
that.
they
may
think
that
the
object
of
this
is
to
lower
the
health
care
costs
for
the
moderately
poor
not
yet
on
medicaid,
and
thereby
prevent
people
from
falling
into
the
medicaid
category.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maine
says
those
are
never
caught--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
that,
but
i...
i
mean,
i'm
a
little
bit
at
sea.
i
absolutely
wouldn't
call
it
primary
jurisdiction.
the
label
doesn't
matter,
but
the...
the...
but...
now,
where
i'm...
where
i'm...
where
i'm
at
sea
is
at
figuring
out
whether
it's
possible
to
say,
and
you
don't
say
this
in
your
brief,
that...
that
a
program
like
maine's,
which
is
arguably,
arguably
wrong,
or
arguably
right,
that
it
can't
go
into
effect
without
the
prior
approval
of
hhs.
now,
that's
going
to
require
me
to
look
up
the
approval
statutes,
a
whole
lot
of
things
that
weren't
briefed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
the
procedure--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
say...
who
does
it
apply
to?
that
is,
the
statute
says
it
applies
to
qualified
residents.
they
define
that
as
people
with
a
maine
rx
enrollment
card,
and
now
i
don't
know
who
those
people
are.
is
it
virtually
everybody
in
the
state?
is
it
a
small
subclass,
those
who
don't
have
insurance?
who
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
a
fairly
small
group.
what
percentage
of
that...
it's
15
percent
of
the
people
of
maine?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
15,
22
percent.
now,
if
that
being
so,
it
sounds
to
me
like
it
could
be
like
the
one
that
was
approved,
or
maybe
it's
not
like
the
one
that
was
approved.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
sounds
like
a
case,
to
me,
that
has
to
go
to
the
secretary,
whose
job
it
is
to
approve
it,
rather
than
having
us
fly
blind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
an
answer
to
my
question.
the
answer
to
my...
my
question
was,
it
sounds
to
me
like
a
program
that
the
secretary
might
approve
or
might
not
approve,
and
so
why
should
we
fly
blind?
why
isn't
it
the
case
that
you
can't
put
this
program
into
effect,
given
federal
law,
without
the
approval
of
the
secretary?
now,
when
she
approves
it
or
disapproves
it,
they
can
argue
about
whether
that
was
legal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
following
you.
is
your
argument
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--even
if
the
secretary
disapproved
this,
were
it
a
plan,
we
still
could
do
it?
if
that's
your
argument,
i'll
answer
that
question.
that's
a
legal
question.
i
think
it's
an
easy
one
to
answer.
in
my
mind,
the
answer's
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
can
explain
why
it
shouldn't
be
no,
but
i
want
to
know
if
that's
what
i'm
supposed
to
decide.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
fine.
so
then
you
want
me
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
have
this
statute
even
if
the
secretary,
were
it
an
amendment
to
the
medicaid
plan,
would
say
no,
okay?
i
say
that's
a
legal
question
we
can
decide.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
what
you
think
we
should
decide
now?
are
you
following
what
i'm
saying
or
not?
am
i
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
can
decide
the
question
if
the
sec...
you're
saying...
suppose
the
secretary's
approval
makes
no
difference.
let
us
assume
the
secretary
would
disapprove
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
would...
a
legal
question,
can
you
have
this
statute
anyway?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
that's
what
you
think
we
should
decide?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
what
you
think
we
should
decide,
fine,
then
why
isn't
the
answer
to
that
question
clearly
no?
you
would
have
a
federal
statute,
it
uses
the
federal
program,
the
secretary
thinks
it's
contrary
to
the
federal
program,
the
secretary's
views
are
within
her
authority,
let's
say,
under
the...
under
the
federal
program,
and
so
a
state
cannot
put
something
into
effect--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
is
so
clearly
contrary
to
the
medicaid
program
using
the
medicaid
device.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
is
congress--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
how
could
congress--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--sorry.
no,
go
ahead.
finish,
please.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
why?
i
mean,
how
could
congress
possibly
want
a
statute
which
would
hurt
the
medicaid
patients
at...
no
argument
it
wouldn't
hurt
some
of
them,
and
has
nothing
to
be
said
for
helping
anyone
related
to
medicaid?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
disagree
about
whether
that's
the
effect.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
can
i
decide
this
case
without
knowing
whether
the
people
in
charge
of
the
statute
agree
with
you
about
that,
as
they
might,
or
you
might
negotiate
some
implementation
of
how
to
have
regulations
that
they
can
agree
to,
or,
or,
or,
the
possibilities
are
endless.
how
can
i
decide
in
your
favor,
in
other
words,
without
knowing,
the
same
question,
what
the
secretary
thinks?
