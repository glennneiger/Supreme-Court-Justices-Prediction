mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1396a,
in
subsection
(a)(19),
which
is
found
on
page
244
of
the
joint
appendix,
congress
made
absolutely
clear,
as
a
singular
precondition
of
all
medicaid
plans,
that
they
must
assure
that
care
and
services
will
be
provided
in
a
manner
consistent
with
simplicity
of
administration
and
the
best
interests
of
the
recipients.
this
statute
does
not
allow
maine
to
use
medicaid
recipients
as
pawns
in
its
effort
to
reduce
health
care
costs
for
those
individuals
who
are
not
eligible
for
medicaid.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
medicaid
statute?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
way
this
operates
is
that
this
is
not
adopted
as
a
part
of
the
state's
plan
that's
subjected
to
review
by
the
secretary
of
hhs.
what
this
is,
is
a
completely
separate
program
that's
been
adopted
independently,
and
all
it
does
is
reach
out
and
hold
the
recipients
of
medicaid
as
hostages
in
order
to
extract
money
from
out-of-state
manufacturers--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
it's
not
a
part
of
the
plan.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
believe
the
secretary
might
have
that
power,
although
i
would
ask
you
to
ask
mr.
kneedler
when...
when
he's
arguing.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
over
and
above
that,
that
doesn't...
but
that's
not
an
exclusive
remedy,
that's
all.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--there's
a...
there's
a
formalistic
way
of
looking
at
it,
which
is
that
they
have
a
state
plan,
and
this
is
not
incorporated
as
part
of
the
state
plan.
what
this
has
been...
what
has
been
done
here
is
to
adopt
a
completely
separate
program
which
simply
reaches
out,
as
i
said
before,
and
seeks
to
hold
hostage
certain
elements
of
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
no,
there
has
to
be
a
state
plan.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
(a)(19)
reflects
congressional
intent
that
the
state
has
to
act
in
a
particular
way.
if
it
acts
contrary
to
that
way,
the
only
question
then
is,
are
there
multiple
remedies
available
to
respond
to
it?
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
i
think
the
secretary
does
have
that
authority
to
go
forward,
although
i
would
ask
mr.
kneedler--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i...
there's
an
open
question
as
to
whether
they
could
do
that.
certainly,
if
you
take
the
most
expansive
reading
of
1396r-8(d)
you
could
make
that
argument.
the
alternative
argument
would
be
to
what
extent
that
violates
or
interferes
with
the
formulary
formulations
that
are
embedded
in
the
statute.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
it
doesn't
follow
a
fortiori,
because
what
they're
doing
here
is
imposing
the
prior
authorization
with
respect
to,
you
know,
to
serve
purposes
that
are
completely
unrelated
to
the
medicaid
program.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
you'd
have
to
read
that
provision
in
the
context
of
the
entirety
of
that
provision
providing
for
coverage
of
drugs,
and
i
think
you
have
to
do
it
in
that
context,
and
i
think
there
are
broader
issues
there,
but
the
singular
problem
here,
obviously,
is
that
if
you
interpret
the
statute
as
broadly
as
the
state
of
maine
does
to
say
that
we
can
impose
prior
authorization
requirements,
then
what
they
can
say
is,
we
want
to
extract
money
from
manufacturers
solely
for
the
purpose
of
building
schools
or
roads
or
anything
else
that
we
want
to,
and
there's
no
restriction
on
that,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
what
you're
saying
is
you
want
to
have
prior
authorization
as
a
mechanism
to
deal
within
medicaid,
to
provide
generally
for
a
balance
of
interest
between
medicaid
recipients,
that's
one
thing.
but
what...
what...
what
maine
is
doing
is
using
medicaid
recipients
to
further
completely
unrelated
purposes
of
the
state,
then
it
seems
to
me
what
you've
done
is
essentially
ask
the
federal
government
to
subsidize
a
program
that...
that's
not
an
appropriate
one
to
subsidize.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it
is.
i
think
the
better
way
to
read
the
statute
is
to
recognize
that
this
is
designed
to
benefit
medicaid
recipients,
and
the
problem
is,
once
you
get
past
programs
that
are
designed
to
benefit
recipients
themselves,
it's
very
difficult
to
see
where
you
draw
the
line
after
that
in
terms
of
where
it
goes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
o'connor,
that
is
correct.
they
have
approved
those
programs.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
those
programs
are
in
litigation
as
we
stand
here--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--as
i
stand
here
today,
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't
have
any
particular
problem
with
sending
it
back
to
the
district
court
enjoined
subject
to
approval
by
the
secretary
of
hhs,
i
mean,
if
that's
the
way
the
court
wanted
to
resolve
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know,
justice
scalia,
that
you
need
to
be
dismissing
it
from
federal
court.
i
think
it's
quite
possible
for
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
stay
your
hand
pending--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
there
isn't
a
mechanism
for
asking
the...
to
petition
the
secretary
for
review.
i
think
if
maine
wanted
to
get
approval
of
this
particular
program,
it
certainly
had
it
available
to
do
that.
it
didn't
seek
that
particular
course.
and
justice
breyer,
i
think
it's
important,
in
the
context
of
trying
to
figure
out
primary
jurisdiction,
we
know
the
views
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
this
particular
program.
there
may
be
other
programs,
as
justice
o'connor
identified,
that
come
close
to
the
line
where
the
secretary
would
have
a
different
view,
and
i
think
it's
appropriate
in--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
believe
it
is
the
secretary's
view,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
is
not
my
position.
my
basic
position
is
that
the
court
doesn't
need
to
figure
out
precisely
what
prior
authorizations
are
permissible
in
order
to
decide
this
case,
because
the
one
thing
that
should
be
absolutely
clear
is,
you
cannot
use
this
mechanism
in
a
federal
program
in
order
to
disadvantage
the
primary
recipients
of
that
program
without
serving
any
medicaid,
sort
of,
related
purpose.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that...
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
we'd...
we...
i
mean,
i
think
we
would
take
that
position,
and
that
we...
that
you
cannot
read
(d)(1)
completely
in
isolation,
and...
and
to
the
fullest
extent
of
the
language
of
that,
without
regard
to
the
rest
of
the
provisions
of
(d)(1)
through
(d)(6),
and
you...
and
for
sure,
you
cannot
read
them
without
regard
to
the
more
fundamental
requirement
in
subsection
(a)
and
(a)(19),
that
the
primary
consideration
must
be
the
beneficiaries
of
this
program.
they
are
the
most
needy
people
in
our
country,
and
the
notion
that
you
use
them
as
a
mechanism
for
trying
to
simply
lower
health
care
costs
for
the
steven
kings
of
the
world
strikes
me
as...
as
an
outrageous
position
for
the
state
of
maine
to
take.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
breyer,
that
would
be
a
persuasive
argument
if
this
statute
had
any
kind
of
a
tailoring
mechanism
to
it
whatsoever.
it
is
open
to
all
residents
who
are
otherwise
not
covered
by--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
know
of
any
statutory
mechanism
for
a
third
party
to
come
in
and
ask
the
secretary
to
review
a
state
plan.
i
don't
know
that...
i
don't
know
that
there's
anything
that
prevents
anyone
from
sending
a
letter
to
the
secretary
to
ask
him
to
take,
to
undertake
that.
that
said,
the
secretary
obviously
knows
about
this
particular
scheme.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
the
one
thing
that
we
absolutely
know
about
the
maine
scheme,
and
it...
justice
breyer
described
it,
is
that
every
medicaid
recipient
is
placed
at
risk
by
the
prior
authorization
scheme.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
because
there
was
a
joinder--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
if--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the...
i
don't
have
to
go
to
the
united
states.
the
state
of
maine
concedes
in
its
brief
at
page
25,
maine
rx
can
be
expected
to
trigger
prior
authorization
more
often
than
previously.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
but
there'd
be
no
way
to
enjoin
the
program
before
going
into
effect,
which
means
that
you
essentially
have
to
wait
until
actual
medicaid
recipients
are
deprived
of
drugs
in
order
to
be
able
to
implement...
to
stop
a
program
that
on
its
face
does
nothing
to
benefit
medicaid
beneficiaries,
and
clearly
poses
a
serious
threat
to
them.
i...
if
we
go
back
to
the
hines
v.
davidowitz
language,
it
talks
about
the
full
achievement
of
congress'
objectives.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
but
it
only
authorizes--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--sure.
it...
to
serve
medicaid-related
purposes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i...
i
understand
that,
justice
stevens,
but
the
point
is
that
if
you
read
the
statute,
and
it's
essentially
six,
those
six
words,
to
say
that
the
state
has
unlimited
authority
to
do
that,
it
strikes
me
as
inconceivable
that
congress
would
have
allowed
this
entire
mechanism
to
be
available
for
the
state
to
come
in
and
simply
to
raise
revenue
from
out-of-state
manufacturers.
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
that
kind
of
a
conclusion.
the
much
more
sensible
way
to
narrow
the
statute
is
to
say,
if
it
serves
other
medicaid
purposes,
then
that's
an
appropriate
way
to
proceed.
if
it
doesn't,
then
it
seems
to
me
the...
the
court
has
to
conclude
that
the
best
interests
of
the
beneficiaries
ultimately
has
to
trump
here
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
justice
o'connor,
we
have
sort
of
three
components
to
that
argument.
the
thing
that
is...
i
concede
at
the
outset
that
there
is
no
case
of
this
court
that
directly
controls
in
either
direction.
this
is
a
unique
scheme
that's
been
adopted
here,
and...
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
when
the
entire
burden
of
the
program
falls
out
of
state,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
creates
at
least
a
serious
question
about
what's
going
on
here.
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
there's
no
question
that
states
are
free
to
create
certain
types
of
regulations
that
are
different
from
other
states,
and
that's...
and
that's
not
the
full
sweep
of
the
argument
that
we're
making
here.
what...
what--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
that's--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
wouldn't
presume
to
try
to
teach
you
about
the
commerce
clause,
justice
o'connor,
but
the
reality
of
what's
happening
here
is
much
more
like
the
west
lynn
creamery
case,
where
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
payment
of
a
subsidy,
all
by
out-of-state
entities,
in
order
to
benefit...
in
that
case
it
was
to
benefit
in-state
competitors.
there
are
no
in-state
competitors
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
didn't
hear--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--under
pike
v.
bruce
church.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yeah.
the
reason
we
didn't
raise
that
argument
is
that
we
thought
that
we
would
require...
in
order
to
make
that
argument
we
would
require
more
factual
findings
by
the
district
court--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
order
to
get
into
it,
because
there's
a
balancing
component
to
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
do
think
one
of
the
real
problems
with
this
program
is
that
some
states
will
adopt
this
kind
of
a
scheme
and
other
states
won't
adopt
this
kind
of
a
scheme,
which
means
that
you're
going
to
have
inherent
discrimination
with
respect
to
consumers.
some
consumers
will
benefit
to
the
detriment
of
other
consumers,
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that...
that
the
theory
of
west
lynn
creamery
was
designed
to
say
that
you
don't
just
look
at
the
competitors
and
the
relationships
between
them,
you
have
to
look
more
broadly
at
the
manufacturers,
the
wholesalers,
all
the
retailers,
and
all
the
way
down
to
the
consumers,
and
if
you
have
the
kind
of
discriminatory
effects
here
where
maine
seizes
for
itself
all
the
economic
benefits
and
imposes
on...
on
everyone
else
the
economic
burdens,
that
in
that
circumstance
this
runs
afoul
of
the
core--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--command
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that
was
part...
yes,
to
be
sure,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
part
of
what
they
said.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
accept
our
basic
theory
about
the
clear
discriminatory
implication
of
the
way
the
scheme
operates,
that
kind
of
an
operation
is
per
se
invalid.
that's
what
the
court
held
in...
in
west
lynn
creamery.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
it
doesn't
directly
cover
that,
and
i
conceded
that
at
the
outset.
on
the
other
hand,
the
point
here
is
that
there
are
entities
out
there
in
the
stream
that
are
within
maine,
and
on
whom
this
burden
is
not
imposed.
it
was
chosen
to
impose
the
burden
strictly
on
the
manufacturers,
and
it
is
done
in
a
way
that
will
create
disparate
impacts
with
respect
to
consumers
in
maine
versus
consumers
in
other...
in
other
states--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
and...
and
if
it
operates
within
medicaid,
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
no...
there's
no
significant
argument
to
be
made
there,
because
congress
has
basically
taken
it
over.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
otherwise...
and
one
last
point
i'd
like
to
make,
which
is
simply
that
the
commerce
clause
issue
does
not
need
to
be
addressed
in
the
event
the
court
holds
that
the,
that
the
maine
statute
is
preempted.
if...
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
stevens,
i
want
to
focus
on
the
narrowest
basis
on
which
this
case
can
be
decided,
which
is,
we
have
a
preliminary
injunction
that
was
issued
by
the
district
court.
a
preliminary
injunction
was
issued
on
the
basis
of
two
bases,
1)
the
state
has
not
put
forward
any
medicaid-related
purpose
to
be
served
by
maine
rx,
and
2)
that
no
matter
how
you
want
to
define
it,
there
is
an
obstacle
to
the
full
achievement
of
the
recipient's
primary
interest
of
receiving
medicine.
as
i
said,
there's
a
clear
debate
as
to
exactly
the
extent
of
the
obstacle,
but
that
there
could
be
no
question
that
there
is
an
obstacle,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
this
court
can
do
is
simply
say,
those
two
findings
are
not
an
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
record
in
this
particular
case,
therefore
there
is
a
basis
for
affirming.
if
the
court
wants
to
go
further
from
that
and
say,
on
remand,
some
guidance
might
be
useful
from
the
secretary
of
hhs
and
propose
some
mechanism
by
which
to
have
primary
jurisdiction
or
some
other
mechanism
devised
by
which
to
obtain
the
review
by
the
secretary,
i
think
there's
probably
no
problem
with
that
and,
as
i
said
before,
i
can't
imagine
that
we
would
have
any
complaint
about
that,
but
the
importance
of
this
is
to...
is
to
retain
the
injunction
in
place
so
that
the
unquestioned
harms
that
are
going
to
happen
are
not
allowed
to
take
place,
and
then
try
to
undo
them
after
the
fact,
which
was
the
reason
for
issuing
the
injunction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
when
you
get
past
the
preliminary
injunction
and
you
move
on
to
the
permanent
injunction,
if
they
think
that
they
can
show
no
burden
whatsoever,
or
if
they
think
they
can
show
that
there
are
greater
purposes
to
be
served,
that's
certainly
available
to
them.
but
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
this
court
ought
to
affirm
that,
and
nothing
that
the
first
circuit
said
justifies
taking
any
action
in
this
particular
case.
if
there
are
no
other
questions--
