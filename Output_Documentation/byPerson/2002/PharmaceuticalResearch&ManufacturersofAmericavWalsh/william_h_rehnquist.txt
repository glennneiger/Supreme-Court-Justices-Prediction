chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
01-188,
the
pharmaceutical
research
and
manufacturers
of
america
v.
kevin
concannon,
et
al.--
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
statute...
was
the
statute
discussed
in
the
first
circuit
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the...
the
provision
you
just
read.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the...
wasn't
this--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--one
of
the
reasons
the
first
circuit
vacated
the
injunction,
the
fact
that
there
just
hadn't
been
any
factual
development
here
as
to
what
was
happening?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
hagler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
is
this
actually
a...
the...
the
state...
the
state
of
maine
running
its
medicaid
program,
it...
it's
a
freestanding
statute,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
the
secretary
have
some
discretion
in
this
area
as
to
whether
to
say
it's
good
or
bad,
the...
the
maine
plan,
or
are
you
saying
it's
simply
not
his
business?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
did
congress
in
what
it
enacted
leave
any
room
for
the
secretary
to
have
some
discretion
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if...
if
it's
a
freestanding
pro...
if
it's
a
freestanding
statute,
not
part
of
maine's
medicaid,
how
can
the
secretary
disapprove
a
freestanding
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
question
whether
this
is
correctly
described
as
a
facial
challenge.
you
think
of
a
facial
challenge
more
in
terms
of
somebody
who
has
a...
first
amendment
implications,
or
at
least
criminal
law
applications.
this...
as
i
read
the
first
circuit's
opinion,
although
they
talked
about
a
facial
challenge,
i
thought
what
they
were
saying
was,
we
just
don't
know
enough,
since
the
thing
had
never
gone
into
effect
to
uphold
the
injunction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hagler.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-188,
pharmaceutical
research
and
manufacturers
of
america
versus
walsh
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
