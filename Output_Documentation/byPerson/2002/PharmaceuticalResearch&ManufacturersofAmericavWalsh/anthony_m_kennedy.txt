m.

i
want
to
have--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
any
state
regulation,
a
state
wants
to
have
a
special
rule
for
a
bicycle,
you
could
say,
well,
that
increases
the
cost
to
the
manufacturer
and
the
other
states
have
to
pay
for
it,
so
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
that
reasoning,
which
was
in
your
brief,
carries
the
day.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
i've
got
quite--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
had
thought
you
might
make
the
argument...
i
didn't
see
it
in
your
brief,
maybe
i
missed
it...
that
this
is
just
so
burdensome
on
manufacturers
to
go
from
state
to
state
to
state
that
it's
just
an...
it's
an
undue
burden
on
an
interstate
transaction,
period.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
southern
pacific
v.
arizona.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
other
thing
i
wondered
about
is,
if
you've
come
over
vermont
or
new
york
you
can't
have
the
advantage
of
this.
i
suppose
it's
not
necessarily
in
your
interest
to
argue
that
it
has
to
be
expanded
to
other
states,
but
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
also
was
a
questionable
part
of
the
program.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
does
that
lead
to
a
conclusion
as
to
its
view
as
to
this
program
that
we're
considering?
is
it
valid,
or
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
far
as
the
secretary
is
concerned.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
wasn't
the
plan
put
into
effect
if
the
injunction
was
lifted?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
i
see.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
federal
government,
with
reference
to
medicaid,
certainly
thinks
prior
authorization
is
an
important
enforcement
mechanism
and
now
you're
saying
oh,
don't
worry
about
it,
it
doesn't
make
much
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
hard
for
me
to
accept.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
very
reason
you
put
that
on
the
bargaining
table
is
because
you
know
it's
going
to...
it's
going
to
slow
down
the
sales
of
some
of
these
drugs.
incidentally,
i...
and
you
can
answer
that.
i
take
it
that
if
company
x
has
10
different
drugs,
and
it
can't
agree
with
you
on
the
rebate
price
for
just
one,
that
all
of
those
drugs
must
have
prior
authorization,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
read
the
government's
brief
to
the
contrary,
but
i'll
take
a
look
at
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
representing
that
it's
drug-by-drug,
so
a
company
can
agree
with
you
as
to
nine
of
the
drugs,
and
those
will
not
be
subject
to
prior
authorization,
but
only
the
tenth
drug,
as
to
which
you
can't
agree,
will
be
subject
to
prior
authorization?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
your
representation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
it
allow
it,
if
it
uses,
to
look
on
a
company-by-company
basis,
as
i'd
first
described?
in
other
words,
does
it
subject--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
discretion
of
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
