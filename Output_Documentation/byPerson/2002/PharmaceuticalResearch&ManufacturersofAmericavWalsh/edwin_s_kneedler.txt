mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
department
of
health
&
human
services
has
articulated
a
position
on
two
issues
that
are
directly
relevant
to
this
case,
and
those
positions
are
set
forth
in
the
letter
to
the
state
medicaid
directors
that
is
set
forth
in
an
appendix
to
our
brief
at
page,
i
believe
it's
page
45a
it
begins.
the
first
of
those--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
i
could...
there
are
two
problems--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
are
two
problems
with
the...
with
the
state
program
under
this
medicaid
director's
letter
that
the
secretary
sent
out.
the
first
is
that
it's
the
position
of
the
department
that
a
plan
such
as
this,
which
imposes
a
prior
approval
requirement
for
medicaid
patients,
if
the
drug
manufacturer
does
not
pay
rebates
with
respect
to
sales
to
nonmedicaid
patients,
that
sort
of
change
is
a
material
change
in
the
state's
plan
which
requires
the
approval
of
a
plan
amendment.
there
is
a
regulation
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
at
page
28,
and
quote,
that
requires
that,
and
that,
by
the
way,
i
think
could
be
the...
the
mechanism
effectively
for
a
prior
jurisdiction
sort
of
approach.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it's...
the...
the...
we
have
cited
this
regulation
in
our
brief,
and
the...
and
under
allens
v.
robbins
the
secretary's,
or
the...
the
secretary's
interpretation's
set
forth
in
the
brief.
it's
also
set
forth
in
the
medicaid
director's
letter.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
i
could
just
answer
that
and
then
move
to
the
second
question,
because
i
think
it's
related,
the
regulation
identifies
what...
that
material
changes
in
the
plan
have
to
be
submitted
for
an
amendment.
the
secretary's
enforcement
authority
comes
from
a
different
source,
which
is
in
42
u.s.c.
1396c,
which
allows
the
secretary
to
cut
off
funds
in
whole
or
in
part
if
a
state
is
operating
under
a
plan
that
requires
an
amendment
because
of
those
changes,
so...
but
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
it
was...
it's
entirely
reasonable...
first
of
all,
that's
a
matter
of
enforcement
discretion
under
heckler
v.
cheney,
and
at
least
for
the
time
being,
why
this...
while
this
case
is
under...
is
under
submission,
the
secretary
has
not...
has
not
proceeded.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
going
forward,
i
mean,
the
secretary
issued
this
medicaid
director's
letter
in
september,
after
the
court
had
granted
review--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
this
was
an
area
that
required
attention.
going
forward,
we...
we
expect
that...
that
states
will
submit
their
proposals
to
the
secretary
as
plan
amendments--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
here's
the
way
i
think
that
it
could
proceed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i...
i
think
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case
would
allow
that,
and
let
me
explain
why.
the
secretary's
second
position
in
this
case,
which
i
wanted
to
also
make
sure
i
articulated,
which
was
that
a...
that
a
proposed,
or
a
plan
such
as
this,
which
provides
for
rebates
for
nonmedicaid
patients,
still
must
serve
some
medicaid
purpose.
in
the
district
court,
when
the
district
court
entered
what
is
only
a
preliminary
injunction
at
this
stage,
at
page
71
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
district
court
pointed
out
that
the
state
had
not
argued
that
its
proposal
served
any
medicaid
purpose.
as
the
preliminary
injunction
was
entered,
it
was
entered
on
that
premise.
the
court
of
appeals
then
speculated
that
perhaps
it
does
serve
a
medicaid
purpose,
but
looking
back
at
when
the
preliminary
injunction
was
entered,
it
was
entered
on
the
premise
that
it
served
none,
and
we
think,
and
the
secretary
believes
that
a
plan
must
at
least
serve
some
medicaid
purpose.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if...
on
the
proper
showing.
the
rationale--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
the
rationale
adopted
by
the
district
court
was
the
rationale
that
some--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's...
but
we
believe
that
the
purpose
that
has
been
advanced
does
not
save
this
statute.
the
purpose
that
has
been
advanced
and
was
identified
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
purpose
that
some
people
who
were
close
to
being
medicaid-eligible
will
be
forced
to
spend
more
on
drugs,
may
become
medicaid-eligible,
and
therefore
cost
the
medicaid
program
more
money.
that's
a
medicaid-related
purpose.
the
problem
is,
the
state
statute
is
not
tailored
to
people
who
are
close
to
the
poverty
line.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
the
court
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
in
effect
affirmed
the
district
court's
injunction,
which
was
entered
on
the
basis
that
the
plan
serves
no
medicaid-related
purpose,
the
state
program
would
be
enjoined.
at
that
point
the
state
of
maine
could
submit
the
program
to
the
secretary
of
health
&
human
services
along
with
any
justifications
for
the
plan,
such
as
those...
there
are
two
additional
ones
that
have
been
raised
in
its
brief
in
this
court
for
the
first
time,
and
we
think
that's
how
it
should
play
out.
this
is
a...
right
now,
the
case
presents
a
very
narrow
issue
on
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
don't
think
it
would
be
a
hearing
in
the
district
court.
we
believe
it
should
be
submitted
to
the
secretary,
because
a
plan
amendment
is
required,
but
we
do
believe
that...
that
the
petitioner
has
made
a
sufficient
showing
based
on
the,
on
what
the
district
court
said,
that
this
plan,
that
maine
had
offered
no
justification,
no
medicaid
justification
for
the
plan.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we...
we
do.
the
legislative
history
of
the
prior
approval
position--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
and
also
there
are
two
other
provisions
of
the
act
which
we
think
are
relevant,
on
the
one
hand,
a19,
which
talks
about
the
best
interests
of
the
patients,
but
on
the
other
hand,
a(30)...
this
is
1396a(30)(a),
which
says
that
a
state
plan
must
provide
for
methods
of
payment
that
advance
efficiency
and
economy
in
the
medicaid
program.
we
think
both
of
those
speak
to
interests
within
the
medicaid
program
and
require
in
the
prior
approval
process,
as
well
as
in
the
administration
of
the
plan
generally,
weighing
the
interests
of
the
medicaid
beneficiaries
against
the
broader
institutional
interests
of
the
medicaid
program.
if
there
was
no
medicaid-related
purpose
requirement
at
all,
then
a
state
could
impose
a
prior
approval
requirement
if
the
drug
company
contributes
money
to
the
art
museum
or
to
the
state
highway
program.
we
think
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
dublino,
the
state
must
be
pursuing
a
purpose
in
common
with
the
federal
government,
a
medicaid-related
purpose.
what...
what
the
scope--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
ripe
for
this
court's
review,
but
we
now...
we
now
believe
that,
given
that
the
director's
letter
that
was
sent
out
in
september,
that
there
is
a
basis,
there's
an
articulation
of
the
secretary's
position
both
on
plan
amendments
and
the
requirement
of
a
medicaid-related
purpose
that...
that
this
court
could
properly
dispose
of
this
case
in
the
narrow...
in
the
narrow
way
i
suggested
which,
of
course,
would
also
obviate
any
requirement
to
consider
the
commerce
clause
question.
things
have
evolved
in
the
secretary's
evaluation
of
this
and,
as
justice
o'connor,
i
think
pointed
out,
the
secretary
has
since
approved
a
michigan
plan
amendment
under
this
same
general
approach.
