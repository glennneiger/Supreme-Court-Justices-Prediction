justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
do
you--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
is
it...
is
it
the
case,
if
we
were
to,
let's
suppose,
affirm
here,
that
the
health
&
human
services
head
could
nonetheless
call
a
halt
to
it
and
say,
you
no
longer
conform
with
our
understanding
of
what's
required,
you're
holding
hostage
our
medicaid
recipients
and
it's
having
a
negative
effect
on
them
because
of
the
prior
approval
requirements
of
drugs
that
otherwise
wouldn't
be
required?
is...
would...
would
the
secretary
have
that
power?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
probably
will.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
correct
that
the
secretary
has
approved
a
few
plans
in
other
states
that
do
go
beyond,
technically,
the
direct
medicaid
recipients,
for
instance,
the
people
who
are
very
close
to
the
line
and
might
well
become
eligible
soon?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
phillips,
do
you
also
rely
on
the
commerce
clause
as
somehow
prohibiting
what
maine
has
done--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
if
so,
how
do
you
make
that
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
anything
in
the
commerce
clause
that
prevents
a
state
from
addressing
within
its
state
boundaries
requirements
for
dispensing
prescription
drugs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
like
a
special
fuel
requirement
for
automobiles?
do
you
think
california
can
set
certain
standards,
that
of
course
it
affects
the
auto
manufacturers?
they
don't
make
them
in
california.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
not
what
happened
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
understand
the
commerce
clause
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
there
some--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
there
some
mechanism
by...
or
authority
by
which
we
could
somehow
refer
this
back
to
the
district
court
to
seek
some
kind
of
information
from
the
secretary?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how...
how
could
we
do
it?
i
don't
know
of
a
doctrine
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--would
you...
would
you
finish
your
response
to
me--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
tell
me--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
it
is
that
you
think
we
could
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
did
maine
offer
in
the
district
court,
in
the
hearings
on
whether
a
preliminary
injunction
should
issue,
a
justification
for
how
the
maine
rx
program
benefits
medicaid
patients?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
has
been
approved
for
maine?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
secretary
theoretically
could
conclude
already
that
to
require
prior
approval
for
every
prescription
drug
will
have
negative
effects
on
medicaid
recipients
who
otherwise
would
not
have
to
seek
prior
approval,
because
there's
quite
a
bit
in
the
record
about
the
difficulty
when
prior
approval
must
be
obtained.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
program
now
in
a...
being
operated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
way
you
spoke,
i
thought
you
had
some
current
experience.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
medicaid,
for
medicaid
patients.
