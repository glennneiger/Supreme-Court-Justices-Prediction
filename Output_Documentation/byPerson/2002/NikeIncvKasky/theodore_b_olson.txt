mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
california
has
transferred
its
governmental
authority
to
regulate
marketplace
communications
to
anyone
and
everyone
who
possesses
the
price
of
the
filing
fee.
unelected,
unaccountable
private
enforcers,
uninhibited
by
established
notions
of
concrete
harm
or
public
duty,
have
the
power
to
advance
their
own
agendas
or
personal
ideological
battles
by
launching
complex,
burdensome,
and
expensive
litigation.
the
in
terrorem
effect
and
potential
for
abuse
is
difficult
to
overstate.
this
case
can
and
should,
we
submit,
be
evaluated
according
to
the
means
used
to
regulate
speech
in
california,
not
the
content
of
that
speech.
the
court
and
several
of
the
justices
on
this
court
have
explicitly
and
repeatedly
acknowledged
that
it
is
exceedingly
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
draw
bright
lines
that
segregate
marketplace
speech
according
to
its
content
into
two
separate,
mutually
exclusive
hemispheres,
commercial
and
not
commercial.
these
issues
arise
in
an
infinite
array
of
contexts.
the
speakers
are
imaginative
and
creative,
and
rigid,
permanent,
constitutional
categorization
is
neither
advisable
nor
necessary.
if
the
commercial-noncommercial
dichotomy
is
employed
in
this
case,
and
in
others,
either
alternative
has
undesirable
consequences.
valuable
marketplace
speech...
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
stressed
that
speech
in
the
marketplace
of
commerce
is
valuable.
it's
valuable
to
consumers,
but
either
it
becomes
noncommercial,
making
it
difficult
for
government
to
regulate
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
marketplace,
or
it
then
is
characterized
as
commercial,
which
can
open
the
day...
open
the
way
to
regimes
such
as
california's,
where
anyone
with
a
whim
or
a
grievance
and
a
filing
fee
can
become
a
government-licensed
censor.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
justice
o'connor,
with
respect
to
concrete
harm
with
respect
to
specific
individuals.
first
place,
article
iii
would
require
that,
that
there
actually
be
concrete
harm,
an
individual
participating
in
a
transaction.
this
court
has
held
with
respect
to
10(b)(5)...
rule
10(b)(5),
for
example,
that
there
must
be
a
buyer
or
seller
of
securities.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
it
is,
justice
breyer.
it
will
limit...
first
of
all
it
will
limit
the
regulation
of
marketplace
speech
to
the
traditional
patterns
and
the
regimes
that
have
existed--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if...
well,
if...
there
are
other
problems
with
the
california
statute
in
terms
of
its
breadth
and
its
vagueness
and
things
of
that
nature,
but
the
principal
problem
that
we're
talking
about
here,
which
avoids
the
problem
of
saying
that
everything
is
either
commercial
or
noncommercial,
is
that
traditionally,
for
hundreds
of
years,
the...
the
private
individual
who
has
suffered
that
injury
has
been
able
to
bring
an
action.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
in
the
first
place,
there...
there
is
the
article
iii
requirement
of
actual,
concrete
harm
suffered
by
an
individual.
there
are
hundreds
of
years
of
common
law
tradition
with
respect
to
allowing
an
individual
who
is
the...
who
has
received
in
some
way
a
material
misrepresentation
of
fact,
which
your
question
presupposes,
that...
that
causes
justifiable
reliance
in
the
marketplace
and
actual
harm
as
a
result
of
that
conduct.
now,
with
respect
to
whether
that
individual,
who
can
then
recover
the
damage
actually
suffered,
can
go
on
and
then
seek
some
sort
of
institutional
injunctive
or
equitable
relief,
the
courts
over
the
years,
over
hundreds
of
years
have
developed
circumstances
under
which
the
remedy
in
the
injunctive
suit,
or
in
the
equitable
action,
has
to
be
tailored
to
the
actual
harm
suffered
by
the
individual.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
our
principle,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
the
governmental
power
to
regulate
speech
in
the
marketplace,
which
is
constrained
by
the
first
amendment,
has
been
transferred
to
private
citizens
without
the
normal
constraints
that...
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
one
of
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the...
well,
i
think
that
i
have
to
start
with
the
gertz
case,
in
which
the...
the
supreme
court
said
in
the
context
of
a
libel
suit
there
is
a
governmental
interest
in
protecting
individuals
from
actual
injury
suffered,
but
the
court
went
on
in
gertz
to
say,
but
that's
the
limit
of
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
we
believe
it
does,
justice
ginsburg.
those
kind
of
suits,
persons
who
bought
one
share
who
were
misled
in
the
marketplace,
or
one
pair
of
shoes
who
had
received
misleading
information,
has
been
actually
suffered,
eliminates
the
idea
that
governmental
power
is
being
transferred
to
people
in
gross,
that
the
license
to
be
government,
to
regulate
speech,
is
just
turned
loose
to
everyone.
these
are
traditional
notions
of
who
gets
into
court
and
under
what
circumstances.
act--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--let
me
answer
it
this
way.
this
court
has
said
in
yee
versus
escondido
that
if
the
legal
argument
is
embraced
within
the
question
actually
properly
raised,
the
litigants
can
make
that
argument.
it
also
discussed
that
same
issue
in
the
lebron
case.
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
is
a
requirement,
and
it's
addressed
in
the
appendix
in...
in
the
reply
brief
and
in
the
appendix
to
the
reply
brief
filed
on
behalf
of...
of
nike,
but
it's
also
important
to
recognize
that
this
specific
point
is
raised
in
the...
in
the
cert
petition
itself.
on
pages
27
and
28
nike
said,
made
the
point,
other
features
of
the
california
liability
scream...
scheme
aggravate
the
chilling
effect,
and
then
goes
on
to
elaborate
on
that
point
by
saying,
it
invests
every
single
california
resident
with
the
power
of
a
private
attorney
general,
so--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's...
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
but...
and...
and
mr.
tribe
says
that
it
was
raised
to
a
certain
extent
below.
i
can't
answer
that
question.
i
can
say
it
was
embraced
within
the
question
presented,
it
was
raised
in
the
cert
petition,
it
is
a...
it
is
an
antecedent
question
for
deciding
the
first
amendment
issue
in
this
case,
and
it
is...
it
is
an
issue
that
california
courts
have
been
dealing
with
for
many
years.
for
many,
many
years
the
california
courts
have
talked
about
and
considered
whether
this
any
person
provision
is
proper.
let
me...
i...
i've--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--thank
you.
