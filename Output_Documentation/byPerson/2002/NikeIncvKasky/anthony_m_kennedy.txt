justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do...
do
we
have
a
case
in
which
we
say
that
a...
a
civil
scheme...
i...
i
suppose
there
are
some
criminal
remedies
here,
but
let's
just
think
about
this
as
a
civil
scheme,
that
a
civil
scheme
of
this
type
is
so
burdensome,
so
extensive
that
it
chills
speech
and
is
therefore
invalid?
i...
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we...
we
have
plenty
of
criminal
cases
that
the
criminal
laws
are
either
vague
or
overly
broad
and
that
they
chill
speech.
what
about
in
the
civil
context?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
would
have
to
say
that
this
complaint
and
the
adjudicatory
system
it
wished
to
invoke
chills
speech,
therefore
the
complaint
must
be
dismissed.
i
mean,
is
that
the
remedy
you're--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
a
california
regulatory
agency
signed
its
name
as
the
plaintiff
to
this...
to
this
complaint.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
but...
but
we
have...
we
have
some
cases,
like
the
egg
commission
case
and
so
forth--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--has
i,
think,
a
certain
standing.
it
doesn't
have
to
show
injury
to
itself.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
know
what
we're...
you
know
what
we're
going
to
hear
next,
that
the
californians
are
very
interested
in
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
again...
and
again,
your
best
case
for
this
is
bantam
books,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can't
think
of
any
civil
scheme
which
is,
on
its
face,
so
burdensome
that
it
chills
speech?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
here
the
argument
is,
the
process
of
litigation
is
what
causes
the
substantive
injury--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
a
first
amendment
right,
which
is
clearly
something
you
have
article
iii
standing
to
assert.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
the
question
on
the
merits.
they
say
it
does.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
that's
one
of
the
issues
in
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
what
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
said
in
california.
i
would
think
that's
pretty
good
authority.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
is
your
client
hurt
by
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
he's...
so
he's
not
hurt
by
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
he's
not
hurt
by
that,
how
is
anybody
in
california
hurt
by
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
i--
--well,
you
try
to
have
it
both
ways.
you
say,
well
i'm
here
because
i'm
a
private
attorney
general,
but
i...
i
can't
really
try
this
case
as
well
as
an
attorney
general
could.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
seems
to
me
quite
inconsistent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
it's
very
difficult
to
define
commercial
speech,
then
isn't
it
true
that
under
this
scheme
companies
are
chilled
in
speaking?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are...
are
there
cases
where
we've
upheld
statutes
that
are
chilling
of
speech?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are
they?
