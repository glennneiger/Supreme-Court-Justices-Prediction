--well,
mr.
tribe,
this--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--this...
but
this
court
has
said
that
even
though
commercial
speech
concerns
a
public
issue,
it's
still
commercial
speech--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
we've
applied
a
different
test
to
commercial
speech.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
said
that
in
central
hudson,
we
said
that
in
bolger.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
distinguish
those?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you...
you
take
the
view
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--none
of
the
things
alleged
in
the
complaint
meet
the
commercial
speech
test
set
out
in
central
hudson?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
one
of
them?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
part
do
they
take?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
olson,
do
you
think
that
congress
would
be
able
to
authorize
a
scheme
of
private
attorney
general,
for
instance,
to
enforce
sec
regulations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
california
supreme
court
defined
commercial
speech
as
speech
when
a
person
is
engaged
in
commerce.
just
generally,
is
that
their
basis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
defend
the
california
supreme
court's--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--definition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
it...
if
this
case...
if
we
reach
the
merits,
and
if
we
have
to
address
it,
we're
going
to
have
to
know
what
commercial
speech
is,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we're
going
to
have
to
look
at
california's
definition.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
just
wondered
if
you
supported
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
none
of
this
speech
was
advertising
in
the
true
sense
of
that
term,
was
it?
