what
difference
would
that
make?
i...
i
really
haven't
been
clear
on
what
difference
it
makes
whether
it's
commercial
or
noncommercial.
so
long
as
it's
false,
and
so
long
as
it
misleads
somebody--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i
mean,
even
if
it's
not
commercial
speech,
if
somebody
misleads
me,
to
my
detriment,
with
a
false
statement,
i
wouldn't
have
a
cause
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
is
the
only
way
i
can
rely
to
my
detriment
is
if...
if
it
is
commercial
speech?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
if
i
rely
on
a...
on
a
statement
that...
that
the
person
expects
me
to
rely
on,
and
i
do
so,
and
it
harms
me,
i
have
a
cause
of
action.
i...
does
it
really
matter--
justice
antonin
scalia
let's--
--go
on.
let's
assume
a...
a
law
that...
that...
i...
i
guess
that...
that
there
were,
that...
that
requires
advertising
on
radio
or
television
to
be
supported,
that
you...
you
cannot
make
the
claim
unless
the
claim
is
supported,
all
right,
and
the
burden
is
on
you
to
have
the
support
before
you
can
even
make
it,
and
it's
a
violation,
even...
even
if
it
happens
to
be
true,
if...
if
you
have
not
done
the
studies
that
show
that
this
little
pill
does
this
thing
or...
or
another,
you
cannot
make
the
statement.
now,
i
suppose
we
would
allow
that
in...
in
advertising,
wouldn't
we?
but
would
we
allow
such
a...
such
a
precondition
to...
to
speech
in...
in
a
noncommercial
area?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
is
a
difference
between
what
we're
willing
to
do
with
commercial
speech
and
noncommercial
speech,
but
why...
why
wouldn't
we
limit
it,
limit
the
term
commercial
speech
in
that
context
to
advertising,
to
really...
and...
and
some
of
our
cases
speak
that
way.
it
has
to
be
the
context
of
the
offering
of
a...
of
a
transaction,
the
offering
of
a
deal.
so
that
if
you
have
some
general,
you
know,
advertising
on
television,
we're
a...
we're
a...
an
environmentally
concerned
company,
it
doesn't
fall
within
commercial
speech.
it's
only
if
it's
in
connection...
you
know,
on
the...
on
the
label
it
says,
buy
this
because,
or
you
know,
it's
a
pitch
to
sell
the
product.
isn't
that
a
line
that
it's
feasible
to
draw,
and
why
isn't
that
a
sensible
line?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
it's
not
a
perfect
world.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
haven't
said
that
they're
chilling
of
speech.
