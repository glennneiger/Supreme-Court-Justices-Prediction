justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
there's
another...
think
in
your
mind
of
two
documents.
document
1
is
the
letter
that
nike
sent
to
the...
the
athletic
managers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
put
that
side
by
side
with
the
document
in
the
bolger
case,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
the...
the
discussion
of
venereal
disease.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what...
now,
i...
you
have
to
write
an
opinion,
let's
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
says
the
difference
between
these
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
letter
about
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
as
long
as
we're
writing
distinctions--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
do
i
write
this
distinction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
ftc...
sorry,
if
you're
not
finished.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
mr.
tribe,
as
i
understand
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
will
happen
is,
they'll
find
in
5
minutes
somebody
who
bought
some
nike
shoes
who
feels
the
same
way,
you
know,
so
you'll
just
have
this
exact
suit
with
a
different
plaintiff,
possibly,
or
maybe
mr.
kasky
once
bought
some,
for
all
i
know,
and...
and
so
that
isn't
really
going
to
help,
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
in
your
view,
if
mr.
kasky
has
bought
some
shoes
and
is
prepared
to
say,
you
know,
if
i
hadn't
believed
their
ad
and
hadn't
been
deceived,
i
never
would
have
bought
them--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
can
go
right
ahead
with
this
suit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i...
i
accept
that.
i'm...
you
pointed
to
evils
of
both
the
other
positions,
but
the
problem
that
i'm
having
with
the
third
set
of
evils,
which
i
think
justice
o'connor
expressed--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is,
imagine
an
ad...
it's
really
an
ad,
and
it
says,
our
refrigerators
are
ozone-friendly.
the
penguins
love
them,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
it
turns
out
they
have
the
worst
chemical
in
there
anybody's
ever
heard
of.
it's
going
to
destroy
the
ozone
layer.
they're
lying
through
their
teeth,
all
right.
now,
that
ad,
i
take
it
either
the
ftc
or
a
private
person
could
proceed
against.
i
would
think
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
answer's
yes,
then
we
have
the
problem,
which
i
was
going
to
ask
mr.
tribe,
and
i...
i
need
thinking
on
this,
how
do
you
draw
a
line?
how
do
you
draw
a
line
between,
this
commercial
is
not
a
commercial,
it's
a
letter
sent
to
the
marketing
directors...
i
think
that's
their
best
one...
and
my
penguin-friendly
ozone
commercial?
how
do
we
draw
that
line
legally,
and
you're
doing
it
a
third
way,
but
how
do
we
stop
the
private
ag,
congress
having
the
right
to
give
the
private
ag
the
power
to
go
after
my
penguins?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
asarco,
where
it's
claimed
is,
it's
under
the
fourth
exception
listed
in
asarco.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
cox.
it's
under
the
fourth
cox,
i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
imagine
it
was
new
york
times--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
suppose
it
was,
the
defendant
was
the
new
york
times.
suppose
it
was
a
newspaper,
i
mean,
you
know,
and
somebody's
trying
to
stop
them
from
printing
an
article,
couldn't
they
get
here
under...
under
similar
circumstances?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
don't
know
if
literally
it's
asarco,
but
what
we
have
is
a...
is
a
plausible
claim
that
speech
of
an
important
political
nature
is
being
stopped.
now,
that's
their
claim.
now,
i...
i
would
have
thought
there's
a
way
to
get
the
case
here,
and...
and
why...
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
don't
see
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
amend
the
complaint
in
respect
to
at
least
one
argument,
which
i
think
is
a
substantial
argument,
and
that's
the
argument
that
this
particular
statement,
whether
made
to
the
directors
of
the
marketing,
or
whoever
made
it,
is
a
statement
that
plays
a
role
in
a
public
debate
about
what
kind
of
society
we
wish
to
live
in,
and
it's
looking
towards
action
of
a
legislative
sort,
an
administrative
sort,
or
possibly
an
interdependent
individual
sort,
like
a
boycott,
and
that
being
a
statement
that
plays
that
kind
of
role
in
a
public
debate,
it
is
entitled
to
the
highest
protection
regardless
of
the
forum
it
appeared
in,
so
california
cannot
proceed.
now,
in
respect
to
that
kind
of
an
argument,
what's
your
reply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
really
trying
to
get
you
to
the
merits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
well,
they
say...
they're
saying
don't
look
at...
look
at
the
statement.
it's
the
statement
we're
talking
about,
and
look
at
all
their
examples,
and
the
statement
that
nike
gave
is
characterized,
according
to
them,
as
i
characterized
it,
so
they
say,
we
don't
care
what
it
says
in
the
complaint.
the
complaint
apparently
would
like
us,
something
bad
to
happen
to
us
as
a
result
of
having
made
this
statement.
that's
enough
for
us.
the
first
amendment
protects
us
from
that
bad
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
why
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
accept
that.
i
want
to
get
you
just
back
once
more
if
i
can,
and
you
may
have
nothing
to
add,
but
i...
suppose
we
have
to
get
to
what
i
find
in
this
case
personally
the
hardest
question,
i
think
that
the
federal
trade
commission
certainly
has
the
right
to
regulate
unfair,
deceptive
advertising,
particularly
on
matters
of...
of,
that
you're
trying
to
sell
the
product,
including
those
having
to
do
with,
say,
the
environment.
i
also
think
that
the
first
amendment
is
designed
to
protect
all
participants
in
a
public
debate,
and
public
debates,
contrary,
in
my
mind,
to
what
you
said
before,
are
made
up
of
factual
statements,
primarily,
so
once
you
tie
a
party's
hands
behind
his
back
in
respect
to
facts,
you've
silenced
him.
now,
if
all
parties
should
participate
equally
under
the
first
amendment,
and
also
you
should
be
able
to
have
regulation
by
the
ftc
of
deceptive
advertising,
how
do
i
draw
that
line?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
and
i
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now,
but
that's
not
going
to
help
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
really
looking
for
is
help
in
writing
a
hypothetical
opinion.
i
have
to
write
a
standard,
or
a
rule,
or
a
statement,
and
i
know
that
30
briefs
here,
which
are
excellent,
have
tried
to
get
at
that,
but
i'm
still
in
my
mind
uncertain
about,
say,
your
view
or
the
others
on
what
that
sentence
should
say,
trying
to
distinguish
the
ones
from
the
others.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
where
i
am
really
is,
i...
i
think
it's
possible
to
look
at
the
commercial
speech
cases
as
creating
a
doctrine
with
an
exception,
and
it's
the
unfair
advertising
that
falls
outside
the
doctrine,
so
all
we
know
is,
we're
back
to
square
1
as
far
as
the
commercial
speech
doctrine
is
concerned,
so
let's
face
it
as
if
there
were
no
such
doctrine
and
try
to
figure
out
how
under
the
first
amendment
we
get
proper
standards.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that...
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
don't
know
if
we
want
to
do
it
or
not
do
it.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what...
how
to
go
about
it
if
i
ended
up
thinking
we
should
go
about
it.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
worse...
it's
worse,
actually,
because
i
think
your
case,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
i
think
it's
both.
you
know,
it's
both.
they're
both
trying
to
sell
their
product
and
they're
trying
to
make
a
statement
that's
relevant
to
a
public
debate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
what
do
we
do
if
we're
drawing
this
standard,
and
there's
a
wide
range
of
things
that
quite
honestly
fall
into
both?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
trumps
the
first
amendment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
right.
