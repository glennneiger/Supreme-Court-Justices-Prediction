mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
mid-1990s
there
was,
of
course,
an
intense
debate
on
the
pros
and
cons
of
globalization,
and
of
the
impact
of
companies
like
nike
on
workers
in
the
third
world,
where
nike
contracted
out
much
of
its
production
to
some
900
factories
in
51
countries
with
over
600,000
employees.
now,
the
critics,
many
from
pro-labor
groups,
denounced
nike
as
the
chief
exemplar
of
the
evils
of
globalization,
arguing
that
nike
was
simply
shifting
production
to
places
where
it
could
exploit
the
workforce
and
act
in
ways
that
were
illegal
and
immoral,
and
the
critics
took
much
of
their
documentation
from
the
media.
of
course,
nike
disagreed,
using
the
same
media
venues
as
the
critics
had
used
to
document
what
it
thought
were
the
connections
between
its
presence
and
activities
in
countries
like
south
korea
and
vietnam
and
the
development
of
technological
expertise
in
those
countries,
as
well
as
the
expansion
of
job
opportunities
there,
and
also
arguing
that
it
had
put
in
place
significant
safeguards
against
abuse.
the
products
were
mentioned
only
in
response
to
people
who
said,
well,
look,
this
product
is
made
in
such-and-such
country
and
it's
exploitative,
and
nike
would
have
a
press
release,
or
it...
sometimes
it
would
be
an
op
ed
saying
no,
you've
got
the
wrong
country,
this
product
is
made
in
such-and-such
other
place.
these
were
letters
to
the
editor,
pamphlets.
it
was
on
the
internet,
correspondence.
as
you
might
expect,
the
critics
talked
back.
there
was
a
lively
political
dialogue
about
the
realities
of
the
third
world
and
nike's
role
in
it,
a
little
hard
to
separate
the
two,
when,
as
the
dissenter
below,
one
of
the
dissenters
below
said
nike
had
become
the
poster
child
for
the
evils,
supposedly,
of
globalization,
so
not
surprisingly
the
debate
was
inconclusive.
the
surprise
came
when
the
story
took
an
unusual
turn,
unusual
at
least
in
our
system
of
government.
one
of
the
nike
critics,
marc
kasky,
asked
the
california
courts
to
endorse
his
view
and
to
hold
that
the
statements
that
nike
was
putting
out
were
false
or
were
misleading.
he
invoked
california's
unfair
competition
law
and
the
false
advertising
law
that
it
included,
which
gives
anyone
standing,
so
mr.
kasky
certainly
qualified,
to
sue
another
person
or
corporation,
here
nike
and
its
officers,
for
making
any
statement
in
a
newspaper
or
other
publication
such,
it
goes
on
to
say,
or
any
advertising
device,
including
over
the
internet,
concerning
any
circumstance
or
matter
of
fact
connected
with
anything
the
speaker
intends
to
sell
if
the
statement
is
untrue
or
misleading,
and
the
california
supreme
court
has
read
that
to
cover
anything
that
might
mislead
the
public.
the
plaintiff,
empowered
to
sue
by
the
business
and
professions
code
17204
on
behalf
of,
quote,
the
general
public,
unquote,
did
not,
under
california
decisional
law,
have
to
allege
or
prove
falsity...
it
could
be
an
omission
that
made
something
misleading...
he
didn't
have
to
allege
or
prove
reliance
by
or
injury
to
anyone,
or
any
particular
level
of
fault.
an
inadvertent
omission
will
suffice
under
the
day
decision.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
certainly,
mr.
chief
justice,
and,
in
fact,
one
of
the
suggestions
made
by
the
california
supreme
court
for
how
a
company
could
engage
in
this
debate
without
any
problem
is
simply
omit
all
the
facts
that
might
connect
it
to
the
situation,
and
that
kind
of
omission,
it
would
be
certainly
alleged,
would
be
misleading,
so
the
only
solution
that
nike
is
given
is,
talk
in
vague
generalities.
i
don't
deny,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there
can
be
cases
and
there
can
even
be
fraud
cases,
though
it's
hard,
given
the
pleading
requirements
of
the
fraud
tort,
that
do
rest
on
omissions,
but
i'm
just
suggesting
how...
how
capacious...
how
capacious
this
is.
the
relief
that
is
available
and
was
requested
by
mr.
kasky
includes,
and
i
don't
think
we
should
forget
the
importance
of
this,
an
adjudication
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
an
unlawful
business
practice,
and
in
nike's
case
that
would
be
no
small
matter.
i
mean,
it
would
be
said
you're
guilty
of
exploiting
women
and
children
in
the
third
world,
guilty
as
charged,
and
not
being
honest
about
it,
a
scarlet
letter
more
damning
than
the
label
of
national
labor
relations
act
violator
that
this
court
a
year
ago
in
b&k
versus
nlrb
treated
as
so
grave
a
blot
on
the
reputation
of
a
company
that
it
mustn't
be
imposed
for
activity
within
the
first
amendment
zone
without
giving
the
defendant
significant
leeway.
secondly,
there
is
available
a
court-ordered
injunction
both
prohibitory
and
mandatory
in
one
case
involving
the
alta-dena
dairy
in
california
under
this
statute.
the
consumers
union
of
the
united
states
brought
the
suit
as
a
private
attorney
general
against
a
dairy
that
had
been
putting
out
its
products
of
raw
milk
saying
they
were
just
as
nutritious
and
healthy
as
pasteurized
milk,
and
the
remedy
was
a
10-year
mandate
of
corrective
speech,
as
it
were,
corrective
education.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
guess
to
make
some
people...
this...
that's
what
the
statute
says,
that
some
people
might
have
been
misled.
needless
to
say,
the
kind
of
show
trial
that
would
be
involved
in
this
case
is
a
lot
more
expensive
than
that
one.
that
case,
by
the
way,
took
54
days
to
try,
44
witnesses,
there
were
40,000
pages
of
exhibits,
at
the
end
a
restitutionary
order
of
$100,000
was
given,
and
in
that
case
the
attorney
general
joined
the
suit,
he
collected
the
restitution--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
suppose
bantam
books--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
bantam
books
comes
to
mind.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
there
it
was
less
than
this,
it
was
simply
you
were
on
a
list
of
books.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
context
itself
took
the
position
in
b&k
that
chilling
effect
was
important,
and
what
about
defamation?
i
mean,
the
central
meaning
of
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
and
gertz
and,
you
know,
and
time
v.
hill
is
that
even
when
you
have
someone
who
is
harmed,
reputational
harm,
concrete
harm,
so
that
the
regulation
of
speech
is
simply
ancillary
to
vindicating
tangible
interest,
even
there
the
chilling
effect
is
so
great
that
even
though
there's
no
positive
value
in
false
statements
you
have
to
put
a
burden...
it's
a
matter
of
public
interest.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
essentially
that's
right,
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--this
trial
itself
is
illegitimate.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
let
me
say
two
things,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all
the
court
has
never
said
that
the
constitution
and
its
first
amendment
are
wholly
invisible
to
commercial
speech,
that
is,
if
you're
going
after
commercial
harms,
then
there's
a
lower
standard
for
commercial
speech,
the
four-part
central
hudson
test.
discovery
network
made
clear
that
if
you're
coming
at
it
from
a
different
angle,
commercial
speech
is
just
as
good
as
anything
else.
r.a.v.,
i
think,
dispelled
the
notion
that
the
constitution
has
these
blind
spots
and,
indeed,
the
whole
approach
of
the
court
below
and
of
mr.
kasky
was,
we
don't
even
have
to
deal
with
your
first
amendment
arguments--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--because
it's
misleading
commercial
speech.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
actually,
we--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right,
justice
o'connor,
we
don't
think
any
of
them
do,
but
even
if
they
did,
this
scheme--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
actually,
they
don't
come
close
in
general,
and
i
think
the
best
way
to
illustrate
that
is
to
look
not
at
the
various
verbal
formulas
that
have
been
used
by
this
court
in
terms
of
whether
it's
advertising
format,
whether
it's...
in
one
case
i
think
justice
stevens
talked
about
something
being
transaction-driven,
but
look
at
the
example
that
this
court
gave
in
central
hudson
when
it
was
addressing
the
question,
when
we
allow
greater
regulation
of
speech
that
is
closely
connected
with
the
government's
power
to
regulate
commercial
transactions
we're
not
in
any
way
limiting
your
ability
directly
to
comment.
the
example
that
was
given
was
the
pamphlet
from
the
con
ed
case.
that
was
an
example
of
direct
comment,
and
you
look
at
the
pamphlet
which
was
in
the
joint
appendix
in...
in
that
case,
and
it
turns
out
the
pamphlet
is
a
detailed
set
of
statements
about
why
nuclear
power
is
safer,
better,
cheaper,
better
for
our
independence,
and
you
know
what,
con
ed
had
a
nuclear
power
plant,
indian
point,
they
clearly
had
an
economic
interest
in
promoting
that
view,
and
that's
the
closest
any
of
these
statements
by
nike
come--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
is
that
the
letter
to
the
university
presidents
and
to
the
athletic
departments
of
these
universities,
which
is
exhibit
r
at
page
190
of
the
lodging,
is
an
extended
argument
about
why
the
claims
against
nike
are
unfounded.
it
is
not
in
any
of
its...
it
doesn't
have
air
jordans
on
it--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
way
trojan
condoms
were...
condoms
were
at
the
end
of
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--submission,
and
in
the
bolger
case
again,
i
think
if
i
were
writing
such
an
opinion
i
would
say,
in
bolger
we
again
reiterated
the
formula
that
had
been
used
in
central
hudson
and
gave
as
an
example
of
something
that
was
not
commercial
speech
the
promotional
pamphlet.
that...
that
was
sent
to
some...
you
know
who
it
was
sent
to?
it
was
sent
only
to
the
customers
of
con
ed.
it
was
an
insert
in
the
bills,
so
there's
no
doubt
that
that
was
speech
that
had
as
its
audience
only
those
people
who
purchased
from
con
ed,
whereas
in
this
case,
these
guys
are
not
direct
purchasers,
and
moreover,
and
i
think
decisively,
that's
the
closest
that
anything
in
this
case
comes
to
commercial
speech.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
i
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i'm
sorry.
i
was
only
going
to
add
that
mr.
kasky,
even
though
he
has
standing
to
do
a
great
deal--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--does
not
have
standing
to
sue
on
behalf
of
the
athletic
directors,
it
turns
out,
because
the
california
courts
in
the
rosenbluth
case
in
2002
said
that
this
is
a
law
where
you're
supposed
to
represent
the
public,
not
sophisticated
organizations,
because
they
might
have
their
own
interests,
so
to
the
closest
this
case
comes--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes,
it's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that's
not
right,
because
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
this
case...
and
its
opinion
i
think
merits
reading.
it's
at
least
as
good
as
the
dissents
in
the
california
supreme
court.
what
it
said
was,
not
that
we
can't
pick
and
choose
somewhere
in
this
pile
of
scattered
material,
as
it
described
it,
something
that
under
a
different
scheme
might
be
permissible.
what
we
hold
is
impermissible
is
making
the
courts
pawns
in
a
public
debate
and
having
what
amounts
to...
they
didn't
use
the
phrase,
show
trial,
but
essentially
they
were
saying
a
trial
in
which
you,
in
effect,
put
on
trial
such
a
large
and
massive
question
and
hopeless
mix
of
fact
and
opinion
as
the
impact
on
the
third
world
of
this
large
company.
now--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
probably
the
single
strongest
point,
and
let
me
connect
it
with
a
broader
theme,
because
in
discovery
network,
when
this
court
talked
about
the
fact
that
commercial
speech
is
a
category
that's
relevant
when
you're
going
after
commercial
harm,
in
a
sense
to
protect
consumers
from
fraud
or
one
kind
or
another,
in
the
reputation
area
it
is
again
not
speech
alone
you're
going
after.
you're
trying
to
vindicate
certain
interests
in
not
being
harmed.
you
have
to
have
someone
whose
reputation
is
harmed.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
think
simply
adding
a
name
wouldn't
necessarily
solve
the
problem.
the
attorney
general
of
california
put
his
arm
around
the
consumer's
union
in
the
alta-dena
case,
but
in
this
case
you
need
a--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right,
but
it
does
have
to
show,
the
statutes
are
written
to
require
it
to
show
that
there
is
an
area
of
legitimate
regulatory
concern.
consumers
might
be
fooled
into
believing,
by
the
egg
nutrition
council,
that
cholesterol
is
good
for
your
heart,
and
they're
trying
to
protect
them.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
first
of
all,
if
they're
very
interested
they
can
do
a
number
of
things.
they
can
pass
something
like...
congress
passed
the
dolphin
protection
act
saying,
if
you
really
care
about
dolphins,
then
whenever
a
can
of
tuna
is
sold,
it
can't
use
the
phrase,
dolphin-friendly,
unless
certain
things
are
met.
california
did
this
with
ozone
at
one
point
and
then
it
repealed
the
ozone-friendly
law.
but
giving
a
company
an
idea
of
what
it
has
to
disclose
and
what
the
issues
are
going
to
be
is
very
different
from
saying,
well,
here
we
are,
we're
sitting
here
and
waiting
until
somebody--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i...
no,
i
think
the
defamation
line
of
cases
is
even
better,
because
at
a
minimum
they
show
that
you
have
to
have
someone
who's
harmed,
and
you
have
to
have
deliberate
or
reckless
falsehood.
imagine
a
law--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it
seems
to
me,
justice
souter,
that's
a
line
enough
to
reverse
this
decision,
but
let
me
just
imagine--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
was.
it
was,
justice
ginsburg.
on
pages
12
to
14
of
our
reply
brief
we
detailed
the
sequence,
and
if
you
look
back
at
the
briefs
in
the
california
supreme
court
the
arguments,
all
of
the
first
amendment
arguments
were
made,
but
they
didn't
get
to
first
base
in
that
court
because
it
said,
hey,
misleading
commercial
speech
gets
no
protection.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
was
going
to
give
an
example--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
was
only
as
applied,
justice
ginsburg.
that
is,
it
does
not
suggest...
these
laws
have
been
on
the
books
since
the
'30s,
and
we're
not
suggesting
that
they
have
to
be
scrapped.
it's
the
innovative--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
an
as-applied
challenge,
because
these
laws,
if
applied
only
in
cases
where
harm
is
alleged
and
where
a
court
says,
to
solve
the
problem
we're
going
to
require
that
it
be
proved,
that
is,
it
would
be
the
california
courts
that
would
have
to
redesign
the
system
to
fix
it,
wouldn't
be
unconstitutional.
i
wanted
to
get--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--who
alleges
no
harm,
and--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
think
it
has
to
be...
i...
i
think
it
probably
is,
but
i
think
that
the
reason
that
it's
not
cured,
although
i
agree
very
much
with
the
position
the
solicitor
general
takes
that
that's
the
deepest
disease,
even
if
it's
taken
out,
imagine
a
law
that
said,
if
you
utter
a
defamatory
statement
that
is
knowingly
false,
we're
going
to
impose
a
gag
order.
even
if
the
attorney
general
administered
it,
you'd
need
to
have
a
possible
victim.
i
mean,
if
someone
says
bad
things
about
william
shakespeare,
and
the
state
of
california
decides
that
it
is
going
to
have
a
general,
floating
power
to
correct
speech
not
connected
with
the
regulatory
responsibilities
of
any
agency
like
the
ftc
or
the...
or
the
sec,
but
a
free-floating
power
to
correct
speech,
we
think
that
would
be
constitutionally
infirm,
but
in
this
case,
in
any
event,
it
doesn't
come
close
to
commercial
speech.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
in...
in
this
forum,
where
the
public
agency
didn't
need
to
allege,
was
not
administering
a
regulatory
program
to
protect
people,
i...
i
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--to
have
an
investigation,
no.
i
think
that
the
freedom
of
speech
includes
the
freedom
to
have
public
as
well
as
private
debate.
that's
what
this
is
about.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
of
course,
in
this
case
discovery
is
the
name
of
the
game,
it
would
become
a
massive
thing.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that
if
we
are
right
that
this
action
dies
aborning,
if
it's
like
the
statute
in
cox
v.
cohn
itself,
where
it
was
simply
an
impermissible
thing,
and
where
no
trial
would
cure
the
problem,
then
you
don't
get
to
that
difficulty,
but
if
it's
a
legitimate
trial,
if
the
law
were
redesigned,
very
broad
discovery
might
be
permissible.
i'm
a
little
worried
about
reserving
some
time,
but
i...
i
don't
want
to
leave
you
in
mid-air--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
will
do
just
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
just
deal
with
a
couple
of
technical
things
first.
the
attorney
general
of
california
was
notified
below.
he
filed
a
brief.
it's
not
required
in
california
that
all
of
the
arguments
be
rehearsed
before
him,
and
most
importantly
the
california
supreme
court
passed
on
the
fundamental
claim
that
this
scheme,
applied
to
public
debate,
violates
the
first
amendment,
and
under
yee
v.
escondido
in
any
event
we
can
make
a
different
argument.
but
if
you
look
at
the
brief
below,
the
most
telling
part
of
it,
i
think...
and
it
gets
to
the
pivot
of
this
case...
this
is
at
pages
30
to
31
of
the
california
supreme
court
brief.
it
there
recites
that
if
the
shoe,
as
it
were,
were
on
the
other
foot,
under
california
law
this
case
would
go
away
in
an
instant.
the
case
decided
unanimously
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
1984
is
epic
v.
superior
court.
in
that
case
there
was
an
ideological
boycott
of
companies
that
were
doing
business
with
the
plaintiff.
the
plaintiff
was
not
thought
to
be
environmentally
friendly
enough.
the
plaintiff
sued
for
trade
libel,
they
wanted
damages,
they
wanted
an
injunction,
they
said
it
was
interference
with
contract.
the
trial
court
was
about
to
hold
the
trial
and
the
supreme
court
of
california,
citing
article
1,
section
2
of
its
constitution,
said,
hey,
public
debate,
there
are
interests
on
both
sides,
but
the
courts
of
california
can't
resolve
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
have
here,
and
this
goes
to
the
question
of
the
private
attorney
general
action,
is
that
if
there
is
a
debate
between
interests
of
labor
and
interests
of
management,
the
california
supreme
court
has
transmogrified
this
old
statute,
which
was
pretty
strange
to
begin
with
but
had
never
been
used
to
stifle
and
silence
the
public
debate,
it's
transformed
it
into
a
conversation-stopper,
and
the
power
to
do
that
is,
i
think,
extraordinary.
they
say,
maybe
there
will
be
a
chill.
if
you
look
at
the
media
brief,
the
media
are
now
saying
that
businesses
around
the
world
are
already
afraid
to
communicate
with
us
because
california
may
get
them,
and
the
european
brief,
filed
by
a
consortium
that
controls
about
$2
trillion
of
investment,
says
that
the
efforts
of
the
european
union
to
encourage
transparency
are
being
frustrated
by
california
saying
that
if
you
come
out
and
answer
these
charges,
as
they
did
in
the
letter
to
the
athletic
directors,
you
can
be
trapped,
because
you're
a
business,
so
you're
trying
to
make
money,
so
it's
commercial
speech.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
