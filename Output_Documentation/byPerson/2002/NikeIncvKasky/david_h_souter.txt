justice
david
h.
souter
what's...
what
is
your
best
reason
for
saying
this
is
a
show
trial?
in
other
words,
you
want
a
new
category,
and
i
had
thought
your
best
reason
was,
and...
and
i
want
to
know
whether
you
agree
with
me
or
whether
there's
something
better--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
thought
your
best
reason
was
that
there
is
no,
no
need
for
any
allegation
and
in
fact
no
allegation
that
anyone
among
the
plaintiffs
or
among
the...
the
class
on
behalf
of
which
they
sue,
the
public,
was
injured
in
any
demonstrable
way.
is
that
the
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
what
the
show
trial
thing--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
isn't...
why
isn't
it...
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
why
shouldn't
it
be
sufficient
to
say
that
when
it
is
the
state
rather
than
any
citizen,
self-selected,
who
brings
this
suit,
we
would
at
least
depend
upon
some
state--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
accountability
as...
as
our...
our
safeguard,
and
we
would
let
that
go
forward
because
we
don't
think
there's
enough
risk
of
improper
chilling?
the
distinction
is,
when
anybody
can
walk
in--
justice
david
h.
souter
--there's
no
accountability.
why
isn't
that
the
line
to
draw?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
let's...
let's
assume
it
could
be
amended
in
some
way.
the
demurrer
is
to
the
complaint
as
it
is,
and
if
we
accept
their
position,
then
you
cannot
go
forward
with
the
complaint
as
it
is.
you
would
have
to
modify
your
lawsuit
by
amendment
or
bring
a
new
one,
and
why
isn't
that
sufficient
for...
for
the
fourth
cox
exception?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
cause
of
action
as
pleaded.
i
mean,
not
a
cause
of
action
that
you
might
have
pleaded,
or
a
different
one
that
you
might
bring.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
we're--
justice
david
h.
souter
you
simply
could
not
go
forward
on
the
cause
of
action
as
you
stated
that
cause
of
action
in
your
pleadings.
you
would
have
to
come
forward
with
a
cause
of
action
which
is
in
some
respect
different
in
order--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
order
to
meet
the
constitutional
objection,
and
if
that
is
the
case,
why
isn't
it
sufficient
under
cox
iv
that
you
could
not
proceed
in
the...
in
the
suit
as
you
have
pleaded
it
and
brought
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it...
is
it
correct
that
in
the
court
below
they
did
raise
the
point
that,
in
fact,
there
was
no
harm
here,
and
one
of
the
defects
of
the
procedure
was
that
no
one,
either
suing,
or
no
one
of
the
class
on
behalf
of
whom
suit
was
brought
had
or
was
alleged
to
have
had
suffered
any
injury?
that
was
in
their
argument,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it
was,
would
that
be
enough?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean,
if...
the...
the
argument
is
not
merely
that
there
is
something
magically
wrong
with
a
private
attorney
general.
the
argument
is
that
what's
wrong
with
a
private
attorney
general
is
that
without
public
accountability,
the
attorney
general
can
sue
without,
in
effect,
showing
any
harm,
so
whether
you
use
the
term
or
not,
that's
the
guts
of
the
argument,
and
if
they
raise
the
guts
below,
isn't
that
enough
to...
to
get
them
into
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
