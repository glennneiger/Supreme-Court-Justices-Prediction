justice
john
paul
stevens
is
your
position
that,
as
i
understand
it,
that
even
if
this
action
were
brought
by
a...
a
public
agency
it
would
still
be
impermissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if,
that
it
would
be
also
impermissible
for
a
public
agency
to
investigate
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
statements
were
true
or
false?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
you...
you
would
agree
a
public
agency
could
investigate
the
charges
here
to
determine
whether
they
are
true
or
false.
could
a...
in
a
private
action,
could
a
private
party
engage
in
discovery
to
find
out
whether
they
were
true
or
false?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can't
think
of
anything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
may
i
interrupt
to
go
back
to
your
article,
your
final
judgment
argument
for
just
a
moment
with
respect
to
this?
supposing
that
we
should
hold
that
in
a
case
like
this,
where
you
don't
have
article
iii
standing,
that
the
case
may
not
go
forward
unless
the
plaintiff
can
meet
the
new
york
times
standard,
prove
actual
malice
and
gross
negligence
and
all
the
rest,
but
it
could
theoretically
go
forward
if
those
allegations
were
made.
my
question
is,
is
it
your
understanding,
as
a
matter
of
california
law
and
as
a
matter
of
the
history
of
this
case,
that
you
would
have
the
right
to...
to
file
an
amendment
to
your
complaint
making
those
allegations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
if
that's
true,
is
it
clear
the
case
is
not
final,
the
judgment
of
law
is
not
final?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
only
if
we
were
to
hold
that
no
matter
what
you
allege,
new
york
times
or
anything
else,
these
statements
are
constitutionally
immune
from
criticism
in
a
proceeding
of
this
kind.
only
in
that
case
would
the
case
really
be
final,
if
we
held
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
think
of
any
case
that
this
court
has
decided
in
which
the
outcome
has
depended
on
whether
or
not
the
speech
was
commercial,
other
than
the
case
the
california
supreme
court
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
there's
any
at
all.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
