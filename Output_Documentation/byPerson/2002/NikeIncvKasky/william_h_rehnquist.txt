chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
02-575,
nike,
inc.
versus
marc
kasky.
mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
some
omissions,
even
though
not
technically
false,
could
be
false
in
their...
in
what
they
convey.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to...
to
make
them
realize
that
raw
milk
was
not
as
good
as
pasteurized
milk?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you'd
better
reserve
now,
or
you
won't
have
any
to
reserve.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
general
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
olson,
you're
saying
that
schemes
other
than
the
one
california
adopted
would
probably
make
much
more
sense
and
be
more
valuable
for
producing
speech,
but
what...
what
principle
is
it
that
you
rely
on
to
say
that
california's
scheme
is
bad,
just
because
there
might
be
others
that
would
be
much
more
favorable
to
the
market
of
speech?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
your
best
authority
so
far
as
a
case
from
our
court
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
answer
the
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hoeber,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
if
it
weren't
raised
below.
i
mean,
if
a
basic
first
amendment
challenge
to
the
statute
is
raised
below,
i
mean,
if
you
lose
in
the
supreme
court
of
california
you're
certainly
not
just
going
to
repeat
exactly
the
same
arguments.
you're
going
to
think
up
some
new
ones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
escondido
case
says
there's
some
latitude
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is...
is
it
different
for
first
amendment
purposes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereas
if
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--whereas
if
it
were
about
globalization
and
what
is
happening
in
these
countries
it
would
be
different
for
first
amendment
purposes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
just
becomes
something
violates...
you're
suggesting
that
if
it...
if
it's
contrary
to
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
surely
it
must
be
constitutional,
but
i'm
not
sure...
i
don't
know
that
we've
ever
said
that
everything
in
the
federal
trade
commission
act
is
constitutional.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hoeber.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tribe,

rehnquist

you,
mr.
tribe.

case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
have

of
the

announce
in
no.
