justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
supposed
to
be
like
the
attorney
general,
mr.
tribe--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
sets
up
a
private
attorney
general
so
this...
mr.
kasky
is
representing
the
public,
but
you've
been
talking
about
the
great
breadth
of
this
statute,
and
i
understand
all
that,
but
where...
at
just
the
threshold,
the
cases
were
thrown
out
in
the
lower
courts
because
they
said
there's
no
circumstances,
there's
nothing
you
can
narrow
this
complaint
down
to,
not
one
piece
of
literature.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nothing,
not
one,
and
the...
the
problem
with
this
case
is
that
it
comes
to
us
at
such
a
preliminary
stage.
there's
been
nothing
like
a
trial,
there's
been
no
narrowing
of
anything,
so
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
to
prevail
you
would
have
to
show
that
none
of
these,
that
there's
not
one
that
would
survive
past
a
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why,
when
it
wasn't
raised
below?
one
of
the
problems
is,
if
you
were
going
to
take
out
this
private
attorney
general,
you
would
be
saying
this
statute
is
unconstitutional,
pro
tonto.
that
wasn't
argued
below.
it
didn't
surface
'til
this
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
was
the
notice--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--where
was
the
notice
to
the
california
attorney
general
that
the
statute
was
being,
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
was
being
attacked
with
regard
to
the
private
attorney
general
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that...
that
justice
souter's
question
to
you
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--isn't
what
infects
these
laws,
that...
that
you
are
allowing
a
champion--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--who
has
no
public
accountability,
and
it
doesn't...
i
don't
see
how
that
comes
to
be
an
as-applied
challenge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
question
that
was
put
to
you
is,
isn't
this
statute
infirm
in
every
instance
where
you
have
a
private
attorney
general?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
what
the
statute
says.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
you
can
pair
one
share
of
stock,
go
into
court
and
say,
i...
i
want
a
class
action,
i'm
going
to
pursue
this
securities
suit,
it's...
it's...
it
goes
back
to
the
question
justice
breyer
asked.
i
buy
one
pair
of
nike
shoes,
i
come
and
say,
okay,
i'm
a
customer
and
i
want
to
sue
on
behalf
of
all
customers
similarly
situated.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
solution,
if
it
allows
room
for
that,
doesn't
really
get
to
the
problem.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
olson,
let...
let
me
just
ask
you
the
procedural
question,
because
i
found
that
your
argument
was
very
well
laid
out,
but
i
did
not
see
that
that
position
was
taken,
and
my
major
concern
was
that
the
california
official
who
should
speak
to
this
question
is
not
before
us,
wasn't
in
this
case
as
far
as
i
know,
the
attorney
general
of
california.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
aren't
you
notified
if
there's
a...
if
there's
a
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
passed
by
congress
so
that
you
will
have
the
opportunity
to
come
in
and
tell
the
court
what
your
view
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
doesn't
show
that
it
was
raised
and
decided
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
you're
saying
is,
is
that
cox
category
has
real
teeth
in
it,
and
that
you
just
can't...
you
have
to
show
that
it's
really
going
to
be
over.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
aspect
of
it
is
that
the
demurrer
was
granted
without
leave
to
repeat,
as
i
understand
it,
was
dismissed
with
prejudice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
would
think
out
in
california
if
a
litigant
is
challenging
a
statute
as
unconstitutional
in
every
instance,
that
you
cannot
have
such
an
institution
of
a
private
attorney
general,
doesn't
the
attorney
general
weigh
in
on
those
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
on
the
issue
of
whether
you
could
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
kind
of
animal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
you
can't
distinguish
what
you
are
targeting
from,
say,
a
label
that
says,
made
by
disabled
veterans,
when
it
wasn't?
you...
you
put
them
in
the
same
category?
