mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
going
to
start
with
the
jurisdictional
issues,
and
the
first
point,
and
mr.
kasky
never
bought
any
nikes.
he
never
bought
any.
i
suppose
now
he
never
will.
he
didn't
buy
any
nikes,
he
had
no
standing
under
article
iii.
as
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
there
was
no
case
or
controversy.
if
it
had
been
brought
in
federal
court
it
would
have
been
dismissed.
now,
in
these
circumstances
this
court
says...
it
said
in
asarco
the
court
can
still
take
jurisdiction,
but
in
asarco,
the
state
court
judgment
there
established
liability
and
left
only
questions
of
what
the
type
of
remedy
might
be.
here,
the
state
court
decision
by
the
california
supreme
court
effectively
overruled
nike's
demurrer
and
remanded
the
case
for
litigation
and
trial.
that
is
not
close
to
asarco.
nike
would
have
to
admit
that
the
statements
were
false
to
get
anywhere
near
the
judgment
in
asarco,
so
the
first
point
on
asarco
is,
it
doesn't
even
apply.
the
court
would
have
to
extend
asarco
to
even
consider
the
next
question,
which
would
be,
if
the
court
did
that,
whether
nike,
which,
of
course
has
the
burden
of
proof,
has
established
that
because
of
this
decision
it
will
suffer
or
has
suffered
an
article
iii
injury.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
no,
that's...
excuse
me,
justice
breyer.
that's...
that's
cox.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
which
i
will
get
to
in
just--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--but
nike
has
the
burden
under
asarco
to
show
that
it...
if
the
court
gets
to
it,
that
it
has
article
iii
standing,
and
i'll
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
reply
brief,
page
6,
and
the
only...
only
factor
that
nike
points
to
to
show
that
it
has
article
iii
standing
is,
and
i
quote,
the
certain
injury
nike
confronts
from
having
to
defend
its
speech
in
this
litigation,
and
i
will
say
that
i
do
not
believe
that
the
process
of
litigation
counts,
or
qualifies,
or
is
sufficient
to
establish
article
iii
standing.
if
it
were--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--the...
the
scheme...
the
scheme
would
be,
your
honor,
perhaps...
no
doubt,
but
the
process
of
litigation.
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
in
asarco,
if
the
process
of
litigation
itself
were
enough
to
establish
article
iii
standing,
then
the
lessees
would
have
had
standing
from
the
moment
they
put
it
in
the
case--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--well,
i
think
that...
that--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--the...
but...
but
going
through
the
process
of
litigation,
if
it
were
a
criminal
case,
the
arrest
and
the
prosecution
and
the
ultimate,
possible
conviction,
but
simply
going
through
the
litigation
does
not
distinguish--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--the
question
on
the
merits
being
the
chilling
effect
of
the
california
scheme--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--not
the...
not
the
litigation
its...
not
the
process
of
litigation
itself.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
under
asarco.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
under--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--well...
well,
what
i'm
saying
is,
that
may...
that
may
well
be
true,
and
it
may
well
be
true
that...
that
a
scheme
can...
can
stifle
speech
and
establish
harm,
but
the...
the
simple
process
of
litigation,
responding
to
discovery
and
going
through
the
litigation
is
not
what
is
stifling
the
speech.
it's--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--well,
all
right,
then
i'll
move
to
my
second
jurisdictional
point,
because
i
want
to
make
sure
it
comes
out,
and
this
is
under
cox,
and
that
is,
there
is
no
final
judgment
because
this
is
a...
in
a
traditional
sense
because
this
is
the
overruling
of
a
demurrer,
but
the
fourth
exception
set
forth
in
cox
provides
a
way
that
this
court
can
hear
a
case
in
this
circumstance,
but
one
of
the
conditions,
necessary
conditions
is
that
were
this
court
to
hear
the
case
and
reverse,
that
would
put
an
end
to
the...
to
the...
to
the
litigation,
at
least
to
the
relevant
cause
of
action.
here,
because
it's
a...
it's
a
demurrer,
and
the
question
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
against
the
demurrer,
nike
has
to
show
that
plaintiff
could
not
amend
the
complaint
in
response
to,
or
respondent
could
not
amend
the
complaint
in
response
to
the...
whatever
defect
might
be--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
california
was
that
we
could
not
amend
the
complaint,
or
the
facts
in
the...
in
the
complaint
could
not
be
amended
to
allege
noncommercial
speech,
noncommercial
speech,
and
that's
true.
we
don't
claim
that
we
would
allege
noncommercial
speech.
for
one
thing,
the
statute
only
covers
commercial
speech,
and
it's
a
red
herring
in
that
sense,
where
under
us...
that
we
would
lose
the
course
of
action
and
we
couldn't
proceed,
so
yes,
the
court
of
appeal
did
finish
by
saying,
we
don't
see
any
reasonable
possibility
that
the
complaint
can
be
amended
to
allege
noncommercial
speech,
so
that--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--well,
it
would...
the
complaint
as
it
is
would
not
be
sufficient,
but
what
cox
says
is,
for
the...
for
the
fourth
exception,
that
the
court's
ruling
of
reversal
must
be
preclusive
of
further
litigation
on
the
cause
of
action,
so
we
gave
the
example--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--well,
it
would
be
the
cause...
the
cause
of
action
would
remain
as
pleaded.
if
the
court...
if
the
court
were
to...
to
say...
and
we
gave
the
example
of
negligence...
the
court
were
to
say
strict
liability
is...
is
unconstitutional,
you
must
have
a...
something
more
than
strict
liability,
you
must
have
negligence,
the
cause
of
action
would
remain
the
same
as--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--as
in
libel
cases--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--it
would
be
more
burdensome.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
well,
we're
certainly
not
going
to
argue
about
words,
and
what...
that
is
certainly
correct,
that
if...
as
pleaded,
and...
and
we
pleaded
under
the
statute
it's
a...
it's
strict
liability,
and
if
the
court
were
to
say,
you
must
have
negligence,
we
would
amend
the
complaint
to
allege
negligence,
so
it
is
certainly
correct
that
as
pleaded
we
would
not
be
proceeding
on
an
as-pleaded.
we
would
amend
the
complaint.
what
i...
what
i'm
saying
is
that
as
i
understand
the
cox
exception,
the
point
of
it
is
that
the
court
is
saying
that
we
will
only
take
a
case
under
cox
iv,
and
we
know
that
if
we
reverse,
the
case
is
over
on
that...
on
that
cause
of
action,
not
the
technicality
of
the
pleading
so
much,
but
the
reality
of
it,
and
if
we
can
amend
the
complain
to
allege
the
additional
element,
it's
really
the
same...
it
is
the
same
cause
of
action.
it's
just
more
burdensome.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
yes.
my...
yes,
i--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--yes.
in...
in
san
francisco
superior
court,
the
trial
court,
the
judge
granted
the
demurrer
without
leave
to
amend.
under
california
law...
and
i
should
say,
california
law
is
not
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
california
law
is
the
field
code,
the
updated
field
code,
but
it
goes
back
to
1872,
in
fact
to
1850,
so
under
california
law,
when
the...
when
the
trial
judge
granted
the
demurrer
without
leave
to
amend,
we
were
entitled
to,
and
we
did
appeal
without
seeking
leave
to
amend,
and...
and
under
california
law,
and
i...
i'll
say
this
in
response
to
the
statement
on
page
4
of
the
reply
brief
that
he
makes
no...
excuse
me,
that
his
abandonment
of
the
claimed
right
to
amend,
we
did
not
abandon.
respondent
did
not
abandon
any
claimed
right
to
amend.
under
california
law,
we
are
entitled
to
amend.
we
didn't
abandon
it.
i'm
not
sure
how...
how
we
could
abandon
it.
we
felt
we
were
right
on
the
law,
and
we
appealed
from
the...
from
the
superior
court
to
the
court
of
appeal.
the
court
of
appeal
ruled
against
us
and
said,
as
i
noted
earlier,
we
don't
see
a
possibility
of
amended...
amending
it
to
noncommercial
speech,
which
we
agree
with.
we
appealed
to
the
california
supreme
court
because
we
felt
we
were
right
on
the
law,
and
the
california
supreme
court
agreed
with
us.
if...
if
the
california
supreme
court
had
said,
you're
wrong
on
the
law,
you've
got
to
prove
negligence,
maybe
the
california
supreme
court
would
have
done
that.
we
would
have
then
amended
the
complaint
and
proved
negligence.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
my...
my
reply
is,
number
1,
if...
if
this
court
were
to
say
the
case
is
barred,
of
course
we
couldn't
amend.
we
could
not
amend,
but...
so...
i'm
not...
i
don't
mean--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--yes,
i...
i'm
going
to...
i'm
about
to
move
to
the
merits.
i'm...
so
yes,
there
are
certain...
certainly
circumstances
we
could
not
amend.
now,
on
the
merits,
and
in
direct
response
to...
to
your
question,
that's
not
this
complaint.
that
is
not
this
complaint.
maybe
there's
a
lot
of
statements
in
nike's
briefs
that
suggest
that's
this
case,
and
that's
this
complaint,
but
the
record
before
this
court
is
in
that
complaint,
and
it's
nowhere
else.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
yes,
and...
and--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--and
it
doesn't
because
the
statements
alleged
in
the
complaint
are
specific,
factual
representations
that
say,
we
make
our
products
in
compliance
with
the
laws
of...
of
the
country
of
manufacture
with
respect
to
wages
and
overtime,
with
respect
to
health
and
safety,
with
respect
to
environmental
standards,
we
pay
our
workers
twice
the
minimum
wage...
they
are
specific
factual
statements
of
that
kind.
they
are
not
statements
that
go
beyond
that,
that
talk
about
globalization--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--my
client
is
here
as...
as
a
private
attorney
general
under
the
california
provisions
authorizing--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--so
he
is
not
hurt
by
it.
he
has,
as
i
said,
no
article
iii
standing.
he...
he
is
not
hurt
by
it.
he
is
a
private
attorney
general,
and
on
the
private
attorney
general
point,
i
will...
i
will
say
this,
on...
we
said
in
our
brief
that
it
was
not
raised.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
everybody
in
california
will
be
hurt
by
it,
or
is
hurt
by
it
in
exactly
the
same
way
that,
under
this
complaint
as
it
would
be
if
it
had
been
brought
by
the
california
attorney
general
or
by
the
federal
trade
commission.
the
california
statute,
apart
from
the
private
attorney
general
provision,
which
is
admittedly
unusual,
maybe
unique,
but
apart
from
the
private
attorney
general
provision,
the
california
statute
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
and
the
california
statute
have
the
same
standard
of
liability,
which
is
likely
to
mislead,
or
likely
to
deceive.
the
solicitor
general's
brief
sets
out
the...
the
standards
on
the
federal
section
5.
they're
essentially
the
same,
a
claim
that
is
likely
to
mislead
people,
that's
material,
and
so
under
section
5
under
the
california
statute
it
is
not
required
that...
that
the
plaintiff
come
in
and
prove
actual
deception,
actual
injury,
actual
harm,
so
it's...
it's
precisely
the
same
under
either
scheme.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
absolutely.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
well,
on
the...
on
the
same
grounds
i
said
before,
we...
if
the
court
were
to
add
an--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--well,
the
case
would
certainly
be
final
if
the
court
held
that.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
we
would
not
be
able
to
amend
the
case.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
it
would
be
over.
on
the
private
attorney
general,
because
it
is
an
unusual
provision,
i
will
only
say
this
on...
on
the
question
whether
it
was
raised
below.
that's
an
easy...
we
said
in
our
brief
it
was
not
raised
below.
that
is
an
easy
matter
to
settle.
nike
filed
the
brief.
they
filed
the
brief
in
the
california
supreme
court.
it's
their--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--well--
[laughter]
i
will
only
say
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
not
raised
below.
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
address
it.
it's
not
even
in
the
cert
petition.
you
can
look
at
pages
8,
9,
and
19
to
23,
and
they've
got
a
different
argument.
it's
not
there.
that's
the
fact.
the
upshot
of
not
raising
it
below,
i'm
assuming
the
court
doesn't
address
arguments
that
were
not
raised
below.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
and
i...
and
i...
i'm
aware
there's
latitude,
and
there's...
there's
latitude
as
to
what's
an
argument
and
what's
a
claim,
but
this
is
a
very
specific
argument
that
the
private
attorney
general
provision
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
not
that
i
recall.
i
don't
recall
that
argument.
the--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--well,
it...
it
certainly
would
not
raise
in
my
mind
an
attack
on
the
private
attorney
general
provision,
but
i
mean,
the
private
attorney
general
provision
is
a
well-known
and
well...
and
well-understood
provision
that
stands
out,
and
to...
to
attack
it,
i
think
you
have
to
mention
it.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
if
they
raised
the
guts
below,
it
would
be
enough.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
i...
i
guess
i
would
say
they
didn't
raise
the
guts
below.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
but
if
they
did,
yes,
i--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--yes.
the
attorney...
the
attorney
general
in
california
under
this
statute,
and
it's
not
just
for
the
private
attorney
general,
but
under
the...
the
false
advertising
and...
and
unfair
competition
statute,
any
time
a...
a
case
gets
on
appeal
the
attorney
general
gets
served
with
the
briefs,
so
when
we
appealed
in
the
first
instance
we
served
the
attorney
general
with
our
briefs,
and
we...
in
the
court
of
appeal
and
again
in
the
california
supreme
court,
and
the
attorney
general
came
in
and
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
the
california
supreme
court
on
our
behalf,
which
of
course
only
related
to
the
merits,
the
commercial
speech
issue,
which
was
the
issue
we
were
litigating.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
no.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
no.
i
want
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to...
to
footnote
3
in
the
reply
brief.
i
think
this
may
clarify
some
matters,
and...
and
in
particular
the
phrase
in...
in
footnote
3
that
says,
public
agencies.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
i'm
sorry,
it's
page
3,
footnote
3,
and
the
reference
to
public
agencies.
the
argument
that...
that
the
private
attorney
general
provision
is
unconstitutional
because
we
don't
have
any
injury,
and
allege
no
injury,
and
it's...
and
it's
unconstitutional,
the
result
of
that
argument
is
that
respondent
is
an
improper
plaintiff,
is
just...
doesn't...
doesn't
meet
constitutional
requirements
as
an
improper
plaintiff.
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that,
then
there
are
no
further
issues
for
this
court,
and
that
is
why
i
direct...
i
focus
on
footnote
3,
because
in
footnote
3,
as
i...
as
i
read
it,
nike
is
saying
that
even
if
the
court
holds
that
the
private
attorney
general
provision
is
unconstitutional
because
the
plaintiff
has
no
injury,
nevertheless
the
court
should
go
on
because
there
will
be
future
lawsuits
filed
by
public
agencies,
and
the
court
should
go
on
to
impose
a
scienter
requirement
of
deliberate
or
reckless
falsehood.
and
i
want
to
say
that
those
public
agencies,
which
is
another
word
for
law
enforcement,
which
would
be
california
attorney
general,
the
district
attorneys,
and
not
only
california,
other
states
and
the
ftc,
they
are
not
before
the
court.
those
parties
are
not
before
the
court.
i
don't
think
we
can
represent
those
parties.
if...
if
respondent
is
an
improper
plaintiff,
there
aren't
any
further
issues,
and
we
can't--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--well,
no...
no--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--well,
i
don't
want
to
say
that,
your
honor.
i
want
to
say
that...
that
if
we
turn
to
the
merits
of
this
case
and...
and
get
away
from
the
private
attorney
general,
if
the
private
attorney
general
is
constitutional,
then
respondent
is
in
the
same
shoes
as
the
federal
trade
commission
or
the
california
attorney
general,
and
that
as
far
as
the
merits,
go
there
is
no
difference.
i
said
earlier
that
the
california
statute,
statutory
scheme
is
the
same
as
section
5.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
well,
in
this
case,
the
reason
i
say...
and
i'm
not
trying
to
carve
out
facts
as
different
from,
necessarily
different
from
anything
else.
the
facts
here
were
representations
about
the
conditions
under
which
the
product
was
made.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
all
right.
now,
those--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
well,
this
case,
and
i...
and
i'll
start
with
a
focus
here,
the...
the
debate
in
this
case
that's
in
the
complaint,
and
the
only
debate
that's
in
the
complaint,
is
the
debate
over
what,
in
fact,
was
going
on
in
the
shoe
factories,
what
in
fact,
were
the
conditions.
that
was
the
debate.
now,
that
debate
is
not
the
same
as
a
public
debate
about
a
larger
public
issue.
it
is
a
debate
about
this
company's
actual
practices.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
well,
i
think...
i
think
it
has
to
be,
your
honor,
because
the...
the
company
is
making
representations
to
consumers
about
its
own
practices
for
the
purpose
of
convincing
those
consumers
that
they
should
buy
the
company's
products,
so
it
is
commercial
speech
in
that
sense.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
it
is
not...
it
is
not
a--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--yes.
it
would
not
be
about
the
company's...
this...
these
statements
are
about
the
company's
products,
the
conditions
under
which
the
products
are
made.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
well,
the
court
has
said
that
if
it
is--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--that
if
it
is
commercial
speech
and
it's
false
or
misleading,
it's
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
i...
i--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--it's
also
true
that
false
factual
statements
have
no
constitutional--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--yes,
you
would
have
a
cause
of
action.
you
would
certainly
have
a
cause
of
action,
and...
and
if
i
sold
you
a
watch
and
told
you
it
was
made
in
the
united
states
and
you
relied
on
that
and
bought
it
from
me
and
i
lied,
or...
or
even
if
i
innocently
told
you
that,
you
could
rescind
the
transaction.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
i...
i--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--i
suspect
it
does
not,
for
a...
for
a
cause
of
action
alleging
reliance
to
my
detriment
and--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--there...
there
is
a
paucity
of
authority
from
this
court
that
was--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--directly
on
point.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
no.
the
case
that...
that
was
most
important,
and
this
maybe
gets
back
to
justice
breyer's
point,
for
our
purposes
would
be
the
egg
commission
case...
the
egg
commission
case,
the
national
commission
on
egg
nutrition,
because
there
was
a
product
and
there
were
attacks
on
the
product
saying
it
caused...
that
the
cholesterol
was
bad,
and
this
is
25
years
ago,
and
it
was
new,
and...
and
the
federal
trade...
and
the
egg
industry
fought
back
and
said
no,
eggs...
eggs
are
helpful
in
nutrition,
and...
and
they
don't
harm,
so
that
was
a
case
where
you
had
a
dispute,
or
a
debate
about
the
product.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
well--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--well,
i...
yes.
if...
if
the
court
wants
to
do
that
in
this
case,
on
this
record--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--then...
then
my
suggestion
is
that
this
case
alleges
specific
representations
about
a...
a
company's
products,
namely
the
conditions
under
which
they
were
made.
consumers
rely
on
those
representations.
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
that.
they
rely
on
those
representations,
and
they
rely
on
them
in
making
decisions
as
to
whether
or
not
to
buy
the
company's
products.
when
companies
make
representations
about
their
products
with
the
purpose
of
consumers
relying
on
those
representations,
and
consumers
do
rely
on
those
representations,
it
violates
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
it
violates
the
california
statute,
and
it
ought
to
be
subject
to
regulation.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
no,
i'm
sure
the
court
has
not
said
that,
and
i...
and
i'm...
and
i--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--i'm
sure...
i
suspect
not.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
well,
it
may
be
feasible
to
draw.
i...
i
imagine
it
would
be
difficult
to
draw,
and
i
think
that's
why
the
federal
trade
commission
says
advertising,
product
labels,
other
promotions
and
marketing
material,
because
it
in
many
instances
is
not
easy
to
draw--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--oh,
i
think
the
california
supreme
court
was
trying
to
spell
out
what
it...
what
it--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--well--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--we
don't
need
to
go
as
far
as
the
california
supreme
court
may
have
gone,
in
particular
with
its
definition
of
product
references,
because
i
think
the
california
supreme
court
was
concerned
about
so-called
image
advertising
and
the
possible
ways
companies
promote
themselves
apart
from
this
particular
product.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
well,
we
support
it,
but
we
don't
have
to
go
as
far,
because
in
this...
because
we
have
representations
about
the
product,
the...
the
circumstances
under
which
the
product
was
made.
we
certainly
agree
that--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--well,
if
the
true
sense
means
advertising
format,
no,
these
were
not
in
advertising
format,
but
for
example,
the...
the...
one
of
the
exhibits
is
the...
is
a
primer,
a
30-page
primer,
which
looks
for
all
the
world
like
the
kind
of
promotional
brochures
and
marketing
material
that's
handed
out
by
lots
of
companies.
now,
it's
not
an
advertisement
on
television,
and...
and
that
line
may
be
feasible
to
draw,
or
it
may...
may
have
fuzzy
edges,
but
it's
going
to
leave
out
a
lot
of
promotions
and
a
lot
of
communications
that
consumers
rely
on.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
no.
[laughter]
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
maybe
the--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--well,
my...
my
position
is
that
it's...
consumer
protection
is--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--not
that
it
trumps
the
first
amendment--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--but...
but
the
hypothetical
is,
it's
both.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
and...
and
if
it
were
just
the...
if
it
was...
if
it
was...
companies...
the
court
has
said
that
companies
have
the
right,
or
speakers
have
the
right
to
comment
directly
on
public
issues,
and...
and
if
you
comment
directly
on
a
public
issue
and
discuss
the
public
issue,
you
are
certainly
protected.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
well,
they...
they
may
be
chilled
in
speaking
if...
because
of
the
difficulty
in
defining
commercial
speech,
and
that
presumably
will
chill
false
statements
as
well,
since
the...
the
statute
and
the
regulation
only
applies
to
false
and
misleading
speech,
and...
and
i
think
that
to
the
extent
the...
the
definition
is...
is
unclear,
it
may...
i
don't
know
that
for
a
fact,
but
it's...
it's
plausible.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
oh
yes.
yes,
there
are.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
well--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--i
think
you
caught
me
there,
your
honor.
on...
back
to...
to
justice
breyer's
question.
i
don't
think
anybody
would
say
defining
commercial
speech
is
easy,
but
in
this
case,
where
we
allege
that...
where
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
company
made
factual
representations
about
its...
the
circumstances
under
which
its
products
are
made,
with
the
purpose
of
persuading
consumers
to
buy
the
product,
and
we
know
that
consumers
want
that
information
and
rely
on
that
information,
that
should
fit
within
any
reasonable
definition
of
commercial
speech.
if--
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
--i
put
that
in
the
commercial
speech
category.
mr.
paul
r.
hoeber
thank
you,
your
honor.
