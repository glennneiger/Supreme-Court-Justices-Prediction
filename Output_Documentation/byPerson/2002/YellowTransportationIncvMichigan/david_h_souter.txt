justice
david
h.
souter
well
that's
one
of
your
views.
and
may...
may
i
ask
you
about
the...
the
answer
you
didn't
give
to
justice
scalia?
let's
assume
the
statute
isn't
as
clear
as...
as
you
are
arguing
that
it
is.
isn't
this
the
point
at
which
you
say,
if
it's
not
that
clear,
chevron
controls
the
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
there
at
least
an
argument
that
congress
could
have
had
that
in
mind
by
the
distinction
between
charged
and
collected?
i
mean,
if
there
is
presumably
a
difference
between
them,
then
the...
then
the
reference
to
charge
would
be
to
a
fee
that
was
not
collected,
which
would
get
you
to
the
point
which
you
said
congress
could
have
but
did
not
provide
for
by
the...
by
the
flat
$10.
so,
i
mean,
i...
i'm
not...
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is,
unless
i'm
missing
something,
i
don't
think
your
statutory
argument
compels
the
conclusion,
but
your
chevron
argument
is...
is...
perhaps
takes
care
of
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
this.
did...
does
michigan...
did
michigan
at
the
relevant
time
have
a
scheme
in
which
every
truck
of
every
size,
weight,
class,
et
cetera
was
charged
the
same
fee?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
can
you
give
me
a
yes
or
no
answer
to
that?
did
michigan
say,
we
have
a
law
that
says
if
you
are
a
truck,
you
pay
x
dollars,
no
ifs
or
buts?
is...
was
that
the
michigan
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
are
you
telling
me
that
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes?
there
is
only
one
category
known
in
michigan
and
that
is
the
category
of
a
truck?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
are
at
least
two
categories.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
there
are
at
least
two
categories,
don't
you
have
to
do
just
what
justice
scalia
said
you
have
to
do?
you
have
to
read
something
into
the
statute,
or
you
would
be
reading
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
charge
against
a
truck
in
category
a
what,
under
the
michigan
law,
you
would
have
charged
against
a
truck
for
category
b.
that
can't
be
right.
so
that
you've
got
to...
as
justice
scalia
has
suggested,
you've
got
to
read
in
some
kind
of
a
categorization
in
addition
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
no
matter
to
whom.
no
matter
to
what
truck.
