justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.
rothfeld,
the
problem
i
have
with...
with
your...
your
argument
is
how
does
one
go
about
identifying
the
category?
is
the
category
michigan
trucks,
or
is
the
category
trucks
subject
to
a
reciprocity
agreement
so
that
if
a
reciprocity
agreement
that
used
to
exist
with
michigan
were
canceled,
or
if...
if
a...
for
that
matter,
a
reciprocity
agreement
that
did...
that
used
to
not
exist
with
new
york
were
adopted,
you
come
into
the
category
or
go
out
of
the
category,
depending
upon
whether
you
have
a
reciprocity
agreement?
what
category
are...
are
you
urging,
and
why
do
you
pick
that
category
instead
of...
instead
of
another
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
for...
for
the
particular
truck,
or
for
the
particular
state
as
to
which
there
is
a
reciprocity
agreement,
or
with
respect
to
any
state
as
to
which
there
is
a
reciprocity
agreement?
it's
hard
to
figure
out
which
category
they...
they
were
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
that's
the
key
word,
of
this
type.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
type?
justice
antonin
scalia
owned
by
this
company?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
from
this
state,
or
subject...
or
from
a
state
that
has...
that
currently
has
a
reciprocity
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.--
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
don't
understand.
i
thought...
i
thought
'91
is
the...
is
the...
is
the
base
period
that...
that's
consulted.
why...
why
would
you
use
the
new
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
only
one
in
'91.
the
second
one
came
in
after
'91.
if
you
allow
a
new
fee
system
to...
to
change
things,
you
should...
you
should
allow
a
new
reciprocity
agreement
to
change
things.
i...
i
just
don't
see
why
this
is
a
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
they...
they
were
both
operating
in
'91?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i...
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
the
change
occurred
in
january
1,
1992,
but
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
reading
in...
you're
reading
in
from
any
carrier.
and...
and,
yes,
that's
reasonable
to
read
that
in,
i
suppose.
but
it's
also
reasonable
to
read
in
from
a
carrier
of...
of
this
sort.
or
you
could
read
in
from
this
particular
truck.
you
could
read
in
a
lot
of...
you
have
to
read
in
something,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
what
you
get
out
of
the
disjunctive.
justice
antonin
scalia
how...
how
does
that
help
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
for
the
trucks
that
were
from
reciprocity
states,
the
fee
was
neither
charged
nor
collected.
so
how
does
the
disjunctive
help
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
casey,
you...
you
say
that
the
purpose
of
this
section
was
to
preserve
state
revenues,
but...
but...
the
consequence
of
the...
the
theory
that
you're
espousing
is...
is
not
just
to
preserve
state
revenues,
but
to
augment
them.
it...
it
allows
the
states
to...
to
take
in
significantly
more
than
they
took
in
before.
that
is,
all
of
those
considerable
states
that
had
reciprocity
and
from
whom
they
collected,
from
whose
trucks
they
collected
nothing,
they
can
now
collect
$10.
that...
that's...
it
goes
far
beyond
preserving
state
revenues.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
i'm...
i'm
not
worried
about
the
sky
falling,
but
i'm
addressing
your
argument
from
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
and
you
say
the
purpose
is
to
preserve
state
revenues,
but
you
come
up
with
a
theory
that
goes
far
beyond
preserving
state
revenues.
it
permits
the
states
to
augment
their...
their
revenues
considerably.
in...
in
order
to
preserve
state
revenues,
you
need
go
no
further
than...
than
your
opponents'
theory.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your...
your
argument
is
you
can
charge
everybody
$10
no
matter
from
what
state.
isn't...
isn't
that
your
theory?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
you
can,
as
far
as
the
federal
statute
is
concerned,
charge
everybody
$10.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i'm...
as
far
as
michigan
is
concerned--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
argument
is
that
you
can
charge
everybody
the
full
$10.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
assert
the
right
to
terminate
reciprocity
agreements.
you...
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
basic
point
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
despite
this
federal
statute,
you
can
terminate
your
reciprocity
agreement
with
kansas
and
charge
the
full
$10.
right?
