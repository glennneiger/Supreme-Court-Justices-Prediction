mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
a
narrow
one,
but
it
has
considerable
practical
importance
for
the
continuing
flow
of
interstate
commerce.
in
1991,
congress
enacted
a
statute
that
was
designed
to
ease
the
burdens
that
state
registration
fees
impose
on
trucks
that
travel
interstate.
to
help
accomplish
that
purpose,
the
statute
provides
that
a
state's
registration
fee
may
not
exceed
the
fee
that
the
state
collected
or
charged
as
of
november
15th,
1991.
the
question
here
before
the
court
is
whether
that
federal
standard
precludes
a
state
from
now
imposing
a
fee
on
a
category
of
trucks
when
the
state
waived
the
fee
as
to
that
category
of
trucks
and
therefore
did
not
actually
collect
or
charge
it
as
of
the
controlling
date.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it...
it
waived
the
fee
for
all
carriers
in
the
category
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
the
state
had
in
place
a
reciprocity
policy.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
do
not
believe.
there
is
actually
nothing
in
the
record,
justice
stevens,
that
indicates
how
many
states
paid
fees...
how
many
trucks
paid
fees
and
how
many
did
not.
it's
my...
our
understanding
that
there
were
trucks
that
were
not
benefitting
from
the
reciprocity
policy
and
therefore
they
would
have
paid
fees.
so
i
think...
i
think
that
the
answer,
although
not
reflected
in
the
record,
is
that
some
trucks
paid
fees
and
some
did
not.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
as
i
say,
the
question
is
whether
if
there
is
a
fee
that
is
waived
as
to
a
category
of
trucks
in
1991,
whether
or
not
that
waiver
must
continue
to
remain
in
place
currently
because
of
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
we
think
that
the
inquiry
that's
posed
by
the
statute
is
how
were
trucks
of
a
particular
type
treated.
and
for
example,
imagine
if
a
state
had
in
place
a
sliding
scale
of
fees
as
to
different
types
of
trucks
at
$10
for
red
trucks,
$5
for
white
trucks,
and
nothing
for
blue
trucks.
the
statute
refers
to
in...
in
terms...
it
says
that
the
state's
fee
must
equal
the
fee
not
to
exceed
$10
per
vehicle
that
the
state
collected
or
charged
as
of
november
15th,
1991.
well,
what
in
that...
in
that
circumstance,
what
is
the
fee
that
the
state
charged
when
there
are
these
different
categories
of
trucks?
we
think
it
has
to
be
understood
to
mean
the
fee
that
the
state
charged
to
trucks
of
that
type,
and
so,
as
i
say,
in
1991
in
michigan
trucks
of
a
particular
type,
trucks
that
were
base-plated
in
the
state
of
illinois,
were
not
subject
to
fees.
we,
therefore,
think
that
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
the
same
policy
has
to
apply
to
trucks
in
that
category
now.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
there
was
a
change
that
was
announced
for
the
1992
registration.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that...
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--to
elaborate
on...
on
justice
o'connor's
question,
in
1991,
the
1991
registration
year,
there
is
no
question,
and
it
is
undisputed,
that
for
the
entitlement
to
operate
in
the
state
in
1991,
on
november
15th,
1991,
the
date
identified
as...
as
crucial
in
the
statute,
trucks
that
were
base-plated
in
states
that
had
reciprocity
understandings
with...
with
illinois
did
not
have
to
pay
fees.
and
therefore,
yellow
transportation,
the
petitioner
here,
whose
trucks
were
base-plated
in...
in
illinois
did
not
pay
fees.
it
is
true,
justice
o'connor,
that
in...
towards
the
end
of
1991,
prior
to
november
15th,
the
state
announced
a
change
for
the
1992
registration
year,
and
yellow,
being
a
diligent
taxpayer,
actually
paid
for
1992
prior
to
november
15th.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
base-plated
means
that
plates,
license
plates,
were
issued
by
that
state.
so
the
state...
the
title
for
the
vehicles
were
in
those
states.
those--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
title--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--either
illinois
license
plates
or
plates
that
were
issued
through
illinois.
there...
this
goes
beyond
any
issue
that's
presented
here,
but
there
is
a
understanding
between
the
states,
the
international
registration
plan,
and
there
are
international
registration
plates
that
can
be
provided
by...
by
any
state,
but
it's
provided
through
a
single
state.
and
so
the
license
plates
here
for
yellow
trucks,
it
is
sort
of
undisputed,
were
provided
by
illinois.
so
there
is
no
question
that
within
the
understanding
of...
of
the
michigan
scheme
in
1991,
the
yellow
trucks
were
based
in
illinois
and
therefore
benefitted
from
the
reciprocity
policy
in
place
in...
in
michigan.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
let
me
be
clear
what
i...
what
i
mean
by
that,
justice
kennedy.
i
don't
mean
type
of
truck
in
terms
of
the
number
of
axles
or...
or
the
weight
of
the
truck.
i...
i
mean
the
category...
the
rule
that
the
state
applied
in
1991...
the
state
had
in
place
a
system
of
rules
that
applied,
different...
as
we
know,
different
fees
to
different
types
of
trucks.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
imagine
that
the
state
had
a
scheme
in
place
in
which
it
charged
$10
for
red
trucks,
$5
for
white
trucks,
nothing
for
blue
trucks,
as
i
suggested
before.
what
is
the...
what
is
the
fee
that
the
state
applied?
you
have
to
say
the
fee
the
state
applied
to
who
and
look
at
the
rule
that
the
state
would
have
applied
in
1991.
and
that
means
identifying
the
type
of
truck
in
the
sense
of
how
would
the
rule
categorize
it.
and
congress
has
frozen
in
place,
we
believe,
the
rules
that
governed
fee
levels
at
the
time.
if
that
were
not
the
approach
one
took
and
there
were
these
different--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
if...
if
the
question,
justice
stevens,
is
whether
the...
the
fee
payer
could
avoid
the
fee
by
somehow
modifying
its
trucks--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--our...
our
understanding,
your
honor,
is
that
that...
the
state
could
not
do
that.
we
think
that
congress
has
frozen
in
place
expressly
by
the
terms
of
the
statute--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--yes,
and
let
me
explain
how
we
think
that
applies.
first,
the
statute
went
into
effect
in
1994,
although
it
was
enacted
in
1991.
so
in
the
intervening
years,
the
state
could
have
done
whatever...
whatever
it
wished.
we
think
that
congress
has
frozen
the
fee
levels
in
place.
now,
whether
those
fee
levels
were
established
by
reciprocity
rule
or
by
unilateral
state
law
or
by
administrative
fiat,
it
wouldn't
matter.
the
state
had
in
place
in
1991
a
policy
that
said
trucks
of
a
certain
character,
trucks
in
this
instance
license
plated
in
a...
in
illinois,
were
not
subject
to
fees.
fees
were
not
demanded
from
those
trucks.
they
weren't
collected.
they
weren't
charged.
those
trucks
did
not
have
to
pay
a
fee
to
entitle
them
to
operate
on
the
state's
roads
as
of
the
relevant
period.
and
that
being
the
case,
we
think
congress,
which
said
the
state's
fee
must
equal
the
fee,
not
to
exceed
$10
per
vehicle--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
we
are
picking
the
category
that
we
think
is...
was
selected
by
congress
because
congress
said
the
fee
in
place
in
1991
is
frozen.
and
so
if
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
it's
not
complex
in
practice.
i
think
that
what
congress
was
asking
the
state
to
do
is
look
at
how
it
would
have
treated
a
truck
of
this
type
in
1991.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
of
whatever--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
no.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
one
would
consider
the
rule
that
was
in
place
in
the
state
just
as
it
did
in
1991
and
say
here's
a
truck,
this
truck
is
base-plated
in
illinois.
that
is
a
characteristic
this
truck
has,
which
is
relevant
under
our
rule,
because
our
rule
says
under
our
existing
reciprocity
policy,
we
will
not
impose
a
fee
on
a
truck
that
has
its
license
plate
issued
by
illinois.
therefore,
this
truck
is
not
subject
to
a
fee.
if
such
a
truck
comes
along
in
1995,
after
the
statute
goes
into
effect...
and
i
should
say
the
statute
here
is
the
refreshing
acronym,
istea,
the
intermodal
surface
transportation
efficiency
act.
when
the
istea
statute
went
into
effect,
this
same...
same
truck
goes
into
the
state
of
michigan.
it
has
characteristics
which
waive
the
fee
to...
as
to
it,
had
this
truck
been
there
in
1991,
those
same
characteristics
make
the
state
waive
the
fee
as
to
it
now,
because
congress
has...
has
used
the
term
the
state
may
not
charge
fees
that
it
was
not
charging
in
1991.
again,
the
precise
language
is
the
state's
fee
must
equal
the
fee
that
the
state
collected
or
charged.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
such
a
vehicle
is
base-plated
in
illinois,
that
is
the
characteristic
that
is
made
relevant
by
the
state's
rule
in
place
in
1991.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that...
that
is
our
view,
and
we
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that...
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
souter.
and
if...
it
is
our
view
that
the...
that
the
statutory
language
is...
is
unambiguous,
but
if
we
are
wrong
about
that
and
if
there
is
any
opportunity
to
find
any
sort
of...
any
wiggle
room
for
the
state
in
the
statute,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
statute
does
not
unambiguously
require
that
reciprocity...
requires
states
to...
to
change
their
reciprocity
rules
because
the
state...
the...
the
statute
refers,
as
i
say,
only
to
the
fee
that
was
charged.
it
certainly
doesn't
say
that
states
may
change
rules,
particular
types
of
rules.
and
that
being
the
case,
chevron
deference
is
mandatory.
here,
in
fact,
agency
deference
should
be
at
its
height.
the
agency
here
was
expressly
delegated
by
congress
the
responsibility
for
promulgating
interpretations
of
the
istea
legislation.
it
conducted
notice
and
comment
rulemaking.
it
received
dozens
of
comments
from
all
interested
parties,
including
the
state
of
michigan.
it
issued
regulations.
it
issued
formal
interpretations
of
the
statute.
it
published
a
closely
reasoned
explanation
for
its
conclusion.
and
in
those
circumstances,
i
think
every
member
of
the
court
has
recognized
that
deference
under
chevron
principles
is
at
its
height,
and
because
i
think
it...
it
simply
cannot
be
said
that
the
statutory
language
is
clearly
inconsistent
with
the
approach
taken
by
the
agency,
the
agency's
approach
must
be
dispositive.
and
here,
what
the
agency
found,
unambiguously
and
expressly,
dealing
precisely
with
the
question
at
issue
before
the
court
now,
is
that
if
states
had
reciprocity
policies
in
place
in
1991,
they
may
not
amend,
change,
rescind,
modify
those
policies
in
such
a
way--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i...
i
think
that
is,
in
our
view,
a
change
in
the
reciprocity
policy.
the
reciprocity
policy
is
determined
by
what...
by
certain
factors.
the
state...
it
could
be
a
principal
place
of
business.
it
could
be
a
different
rule,
place
of
license
plating.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
agency
issued
their
interpretations
of
its
regulations,
which
were
published
actually
at
two
points.
there...
there
was
a
rulemaking
proceeding,
and
along
with
rulemaking
proceeding,
it
issued,
as
i
said,
formal
interpretations
of
the
statute
and
its
rules.
there
it
indicated
expressly
that
in
its
view
reciprocity
agreements
must
be
frozen
and
cannot
be
modified.
a
number
of
states
indicated
that
they
wanted
to
change
their
reciprocity
rules,
and
the
commission
then
held
a
second
administrative
proceeding--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
there
is
actually
some
question
as
to
whether
there
were
formal
reciprocity
agreements
in
place.
there
is
no
question
michigan
had
a
policy
of
providing
fee
waivers
to
trucks
that
were
based
in
states
that
in
michigan
view
provided
equivalent
waivers
to
trucks
that
were
based
in
michigan.
applying
that
policy
in
1991,
michigan
was
of
the
view
that
illinois
provided
such
a
waiver
for
michigan
trucks,
and
therefore,
michigan,
under
its
policy
announced
by
its
public
service
commission,
provided
equivalent
waiver
for
trucks
that
were
based
on
illinois.
that
was
unquestionably
the
rule
that
was
in
place
in
michigan
at
the
relevant
time,
and
because
of
that,
we
think,
that
was
the
fee
that
was
collected
or
charged.
to
identify
the
fee
that
was
collected
or
charged
or
can
now
be
collected
or
charged
from
a
particular
truck
that
comes
from
the
state,
one
has
to
look
at
the
rule
that
was
in
place
then
and
say,
what
was
the
fee
that
would
have
been
applied
then
to
this
truck?
under
that
approach,
michigan
cannot
now
change
its...
its
way
of
implementing
reciprocity
policies
and
therefore
charge
trucks
that
would
not
have
been
charged
at
that
time.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
now,
your
honor,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
couple
of
quick
points.
first,
we
think
that
the
key
issue
in
the
case
has
been
identified
by
questions
from
a
number
of
members
of
the
court.
something
has
to
be
read
into
the
statute.
now,
we
think
what
we
would
read
into
the
statute
is
clearly
the
correct
thing
to
read
into
it,
but
even
if
we
are
not
absolutely
right
about
that,
petitioner
should
prevail
because
given
the
agency's
determination
here,
the...
the
tie
goes
to
this
side
of
the
table
and
we
think
that
that
should
be
dispositive
on
that
issue
in
the
case.
second,
there's
been
some
discussion
about
issues
that
are
other
issues
in
the
case
and...
and
the
proper
disposition
as
to
them.
we
think
that
there
is
no
question
about
the
existence
of
reciprocity
agreements
or
policies
that
would
require
remand,
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
i
think
mr.
casey
has
candidly
acknowledged
that
there
was
clearly
a
reciprocity
policy
in
place
in
michigan,
whether
identified
reciprocity
agreement
or
simply
unilateral
policy.
there
was
no
question
about
the
nature
of
that
policy.
there
has
been
no
dispute
throughout
the
entire
course
of
this
litigation
about
whether
there
was
such
a
policy
and
whether
it
was
consistently
enforced.
and
therefore,
there...
i
think
there
is
no
subject
there
to
be
considered
further
on
remand.
the
question
of
whether
michigan's
prospective
change
in
its
policy
for
the
1992
registration
year
and
whether
yellow's
diligence
in
paying
that
early
should
somehow
affect
the
proper
outcome
here
and
require
yellow
to
pay
in
the
future--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the...
the
question
whether
the
fact
that
yellow
paid
in
advance
of
november
15th,
1991
for
a
registration
year
that
was
not
going
to
go
into
effect
until
sometime
in
1992--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
as
of
1991,
and
the
question
is
collected
or
charged,
in
our
view,
for
what?
and
we
think
it's
for
the
entitlement
to
operate
on
michigan's
roads
at
the
relevant
time.
i
guess
i
would
take
a
little
bit
of
issue
with
what
mr.
schlick
said.
the...
the
icc
we
think
expressly
addressed
that
point
in
its
declaratory
order
when
states,
including
michigan,
said--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
our
view
is
that
if
that
is...
if
there's
to
be
further
litigation
on
that
point,
the
proper
forum
for
that
is
the
administrative
proceeding
that...
that
mr.
schlick
also
mentioned.
there
is
actually
pending
before
the
department
of
transportation
a
proceeding
initiated
by
michigan
which
takes
issue
with
the
ata's...
with
the...
the
icc's
determination
on
that
point
and
asks
for
reconsideration
by
the
agency.
we
think
that
that
is
the
appropriate
place
to
consider
that
where
the
agency
can
exercise
its
expertise.
we
then
appeal
to
the
d.c.
circuit
if
there's
to
be
some...
some
question
about
it.
so
that...
that's
what
we
would
suggest
is
the
appropriate--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
it
is
true
the
michigan
supreme
court
did
not
decide
it.
our
suggestion
is
that
the
more
appropriate
place
for
it
to
be
subject
to
further
litigation,
if
there
is
to
be
further
litigation,
is
in
this
agency
proceeding
with
an
appeal
to
the
federal
court.
but...
but
you
are
correct
that
it
was
not
expressly
addressed
by
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
this...
in
this
case.
one
final
point
quickly
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
whether
the
state
terminated
reciprocity
agreements
or...
or
not,
or
simply
changed
its
policy.
we
think
it
doesn't
matter
how
you
look
at
it.
either
way,
the
state
clearly
changed
the
rule
that
it
was
applying.
it
had
a
clearly
articulated
rule
consistently
applied
that
trucks
based
in
certain
places
would
not
be
subject
to
fees.
it
is
now
changing
that
rule
and
it's
therefore
trying
to
collect
and
charge
fees
as
to
those
trucks
that
it
did
not
charge
before
or
collect
before,
and
we
think
that
is
clearly
precluded
by
the
statutory
language
and
is
certainly
decided
by
the
icc
adversely
to
michigan.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.--
justice--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
we
think
it
can't
be
considered
in
the
aggregate.
first
of
all,
the
statutory
language
refers
to
the
fee
per
vehicle.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
does,
but
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
respond
briefly.
the
particular
provision
which
has
the
fee-freezing
provision
refers
to
the
fee
per
vehicle.
so
i
think
that
would
be
precluded.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
