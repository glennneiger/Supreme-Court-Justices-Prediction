mr.
austin
c.
schlick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
assigned
responsibility
for
implementing
the
single
state
registration
system
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
icc
determined
that
when
states
apply
the
statutory
fee
cap,
they
must
consider
the
reciprocal
fee
reductions
and
reciprocal
fee
waivers
that
were
in
place
as
of
november
15th,
1991.
that
interpretation
serves
the
central
purpose
of
the
fee
cap
provision,
which
was
to
grandfather
the
fees
that
were
in
place
as
of
1991,
but
only
those
fees.
the
michigan
supreme
court's
generic
fee
rule,
on
the
other
hand,
would
convert
congress's
grandfather
provision
into
a
provision
that
would
allow
new
fees.
the
icc's
interpretation
ensures
that
the
capped
registration
fee
is
equal
to
the
fee
that
the
state
actually
collected
or
charged
as
of
november
15th,
1991.
congress
did
not
set
the
cap
at
the
amount
that
the
states
could
have
charged.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
do
that,
the
obvious
thing
to
have
done
would
have
been
to
set
the
cap
at
$10,
which
is
the
amount
that
the
icc
allowed
all
carriers
to
charge
as
of
november
15th,
1991.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
certainly
the
chevron
argument
is...
is
essential
to
this
case.
we
think
that
the
most
natural
reading
of
charge
or...
of
collected
or
charged,
though,
is
charged,
demanded,
collected,
received.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
the
icc
did,
during
the
rulemaking
proceeding,
change
its
interpretation.
as
the
d.c.
circuit
said
in
naruc
v.
icc,
that's
what
comment
periods
are
for.
and
the...
the
commission
ultimately
relied
not
only
on
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
but
also
on
the
purposes
underlying
the
statute.
the
conference
report
on
istea
makes
clear
that
there
were
two
purposes
in...
in
congress's
mind
when
it
drafted
the
statute.
one
was
ensuring
that...
ensuring
benefit
to
carriers,
ensuring
that
the
overall
costs
of
the...
of
the
state
registration
requirements
were
minimized.
the
second
was
preserving
existing
state
revenues.
michigan's
approach,
on
the
other
hand,
would
allow
dramatic
increases
in
the
fee
amounts,
in
this
case
an
increase
from
0
to
$10
per
truck,
that
would
overwhelm
the
administrative
savings
that
congress
intended
to
ensure
through
the
single
state
approach.
that...
that
also
would
be
a
very
odd
policy
to
allow
those
increases
since
congress
would,
in
fact,
have
been
authorizing
increases
that
the
states
themselves
chose
not
to
implement
as
of
1991.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
as
a
general
matter,
that's
correct,
but
let
me
explain,
justice
stevens,
the
particular
problem
presented
here,
which
has
not
been
addressed
by
the
icc
or
the
department
of
transportation
and
that
we
think
is
preserved
on...
on
remand.
as
of
november
15th,
1991,
michigan
arguably
had
two
different
fee
systems
in
place.
the
first
was
the
fee
system
for
1991.
if
yellow
transportation
had
come
to
the
state
of
michigan
and
said,
we'd
like
to
add
an
additional
truck
to...
to
our
registration
for
this
year,
effective
immediately,
michigan
would
have...
it
would
have
charged
and
yellow
would
have
paid
under
the
old
reciprocity
arrangement,
under
which
the
fact
that
the
truck
was
base-plated,
had
a
license
plate
for
illinois
would
have
been
dispositive.
however,
simultaneously,
michigan...
michigan
was...
was
demanding
and
yellow
paid
fees
under
the
1992
reciprocity
approach
where
the
fact
that
the...
the
truck
had
a
license
plate
from
illinois
would
not
be
relevant
and
the
fact
that
yellow
was
headquartered
in
kansas
would
be
relevant.
the
icc
did
not
determine
in
its
american
trucking
associations
proceeding,
which...
which
is
the
relevant
one
on
this
question,
whether
the...
whether
that
sort
of...
of
conflict
would
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
old
rule
or
the
new
rule.
and
that's
the
question
that
we
think
should
remain
open
on
remand.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
right
now
the--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--the
new
rule
would...
would
be
implemented
as...
as
a
result
of
this
unusual
situation,
unique
in
our...
in
our
experience,
where
there
were
two...
where
there
two
fee
systems
in
place
at
the
same
time.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
well,
the
unique
feature
here
is
that
both
were
in
place
and
operational
as
of
november
15th,
1991.
and
the...
that...
there's
also
a
question
of
whether
the
move
to
the
new
fee
system--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--that's
right.
as
of
november
15th,
1991,
both
were
in
place.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
and
operational.
yellow
might--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--to
answer
your
question,
justice
scalia,
the...
the
change...
the
new
system
became
effective
for
the
1992
registration
year
commencing
january
1st,
1992,
but
the
charges
were
assessed
in
the
fall
of
1991.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
the
significance
of
that,
justice
ginsburg,
would
be
something
for
the
department
of
transportation
in
a
pending
proceeding
that's...
that
is
open
now
to
consider.
that...
that's...
that
question
has
not
been
answered,
the
significance
of...
of
the
date
of
payment.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
no.
i
think
there
would
be
much
more
to
it
than
that.
and
again,
this
is...
this
is
a...
a
unique
situation.
there
have
not
been
problems
with
implementing
this
system,
and
the
department
of
transportation
has
before
it
a
request
for
declaratory
ruling
filed
by
michigan,
that
was
mooted
by
the
michigan
supreme
court's
decision
which
adopted
this
generic
view
rule
that
moots
out
all
these
questions.
and
that
proceeding
could
be
reopened
if
this
court
were
to
remand
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
but
the...
the
specific
significance
of
the
date
on
which
yellow
made
payment
has
not
been
addressed
by
the
icc
or
by
the
department
of
transportation.
the...
the
fee
system
here...
the
actual
fee
rule
of
the
icc
has
been
in
place
for
almost
9
years
now.
there
have
not
been
serious
problems
of
administration.
it's
a
mechanical
process
where
states
simply
fill
out
the...
carriers
fill
out
a
chart
which
has
the
applicable
state,
the
number
of
trucks
in
the
state.
it's
a
matter
of
multiplication
and
then
adding
some...
the
fee
for...
for
each
state.
as
i
was
explaining,
the
michigan
situation
is
unique
and
should
be
left
to
be
resolved
by
the
michigan
courts
and
by
the
department
of
transportation.
the
icc--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--we
do,
justice
ginsburg.
that's
a...
a
subpart
of...
of
this
state-specific
question.
the
facts
surrounding
that
have...
have
really
not
been
developed
before
the
michigan
courts
or
even
before
the
department
of
transportation
at
this
point.
the
icc's
interpretation
of
the
fee
cap
is
a
reasonable
implementation
of
congress's
provision.
it's
consistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute
and
its
purposes
and
we
submit
that
it
should
be
upheld.
the
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
should
be
reversed,
and
the
case
should
be
remanded.
