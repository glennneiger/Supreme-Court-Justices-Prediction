anthony
m.
kennedy
your...
your
test
that
you
propose
is
that
it's
the
type
of
truck.
it...
i
take
it
there's
nothing
in...
in
the
statute
or
in
regulatory
pronouncements
that
talk
about
types
of
trucks
unless
it's
the
number
of
axles
or
something.
but
type
of
truck,
it
seems
to
me,
can
be
applied
in
the
generic
way
that
michigan
argues.
it's
a
type
of
truck
because
it
was
within
the
exemption
or
without
the
exemption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
tell
me
again
why
you
think
the
statute
is...
is
clear
and
unambiguous
in
your
favor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
see...
i
see
the
sense
of
a
generic
approach
because
of
the
trucks
being
painted
a
different
color
or
reincorporation
and
so
forth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
find
that
under
the
clear
language
of
the
statute.
there's
a
common
sense
aspect
to
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
guess
our
point
is
that
for
you
to
make
the
statute
work,
you
are
reading
something
into
it
that
isn't
there,
which
is
this
generic
system
and...
or
this
generic
theory.
and
there's
a
certain
amount
of
common
sense
to
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
by
your
having
to
do
that,
you
in
effect
concede
the
statute
is
ambiguous
and
then
your
clear
argument
case
collapses.
