chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
first
case
this
morning
in
which
we'll
hear
argument
is
no.
01-270,
yellow
transportation,
inc.
v.
michigan.
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you
say
as
to
a
category
of
trucks.
why
do
you
add
that
qualification?
why
shouldn't
it
be
true,
if
you're
right,
that
if
a
truck...
if
a
fee
was
waived
as
to
any
truck,
it
should
remain
in
place?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the
term
base-plated
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
base-plated
in
illinois,
then
that
means
the
title
was
issued
in
illinois--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
it
had
illinois
license
plates
on
its
truck?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rothfeld.
mr.
schlick,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schlick.
mr.
casey,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
what
determined
reciprocity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
albeit
on
a
system
that
didn't
go
into
effect
until--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
indicates
what
percentage
of
revenue
a
state
like
michigan
gets
on
the
basis
of
these
reciprocity
agreements
or
how
much...
how
much
of
its
revenue
from
this
kind
of
tax
is
not
affected
by
reciprocity
agreements?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
carrier
in
your
view
signifying
the
entity
that
owns
the
trucks?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
michigan
has
some
interest
in
getting
its
own
trucks...
having
lower
fees
in
other
states
i
suppose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
casey.
mr.
rothfeld,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
understand
the
last
clause
that
you
just
spoke.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
statute
says
collected
or
charged.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it
really
hasn't
been
fully
fleshed
out
here,
that
particular
angle.
i...
i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
consistent
to
agree
with
your
basic
position
and
still
feel
that
was
open
on
remand,
as...
as
the
solicitor
general
said.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-270,
yellow
transportation,
inc.
versus
michigan
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
