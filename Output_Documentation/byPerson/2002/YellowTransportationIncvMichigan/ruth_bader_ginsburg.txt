justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
locked
in
permanently
to
1991.
so
even
if...
let's
say,
the
reciprocity
agreement
persists
in
1991,
but
michigan
wants
to
change
it
in
1993
and
'94.
it
cannot.
it's
locked
in
forever
to
a
reciprocity
agreement
that
it
made
with
its
sister
state
only
for
the
year
1991.
is
that
your
reading?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
new
vehicles?
what
about
a
vehicle
purchased,
say,
in
1995
base-plated
in
illinois?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
not
only
vehicles
that
existed
in
1991,
it's
any
vehicle
thereafter
acquired.
so
one...
one
element
of
this
is
that
michigan
could
not,
on
your
reading,
go
over
to
the
principal
place
of
business,
which
in
this
case
is...
i
take
it,
is
kansas
with
no...
no
reciprocity
with
michigan...
could
not
change
that.
everything
is
frozen
forever
under
istea.
is
that
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
that
was
not
the
commission's
first
view.
the
commission's
first
view
of
this
case
is
that
the
states
would
not
be
bound
by
the
reciprocity
agreements
and
could
charge...
whatever
they
charged
anyone,
they
could
charge
everyone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
yellow
freight
hadn't
paid
early,
would
this
argument
be
off
the
board?
in
other
words,
this...
this
fee
was
paid.
the
1992
paid...
fee
was
paid
before
november
15th,
'91.
suppose
yellow
freight
had
waited
till
after
january
1.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
suggesting
there's
a
possibility
that
somebody
would
be
penalized
for
early
payment,
for
prompt
payment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
say
the
same
thing
for
the
argument
that
there
in
fact
was
no
reciprocity
in
place
with
illinois
in
1991?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you're
wrong
about
the
text
being
unambiguous...
and
you
do
have
an
uphill
argument
there
because
didn't
the
two
lower
courts
in
michigan
reason
the
other
way?
didn't
they
reject
the
argument
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
embraced?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't
the
lower
courts
in
michigan
say
that
was
a
proper
reading,
that
the
icc's
reading--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
a
proper--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--which
makes
it
harder
for
you
to
argue
that
there
is
a
plain
meaning
the
other
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
state
sponsor
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
michigan
you...
you
helpfully
began
your
argument
by
pointing
out
that
the
case
had
been
decided
on
a
different
ground
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
question
of
plain
meaning
or
not
surfaced
for
the
first
time
in
the
michigan
supreme
court,
and
that
was
the
basis
for
its
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
make
that
argument?
did
the
state
of
michigan
make
that
argument,
or
was
it
something
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
brought
up
on
its
own?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
presented
it
but
not
as
your
main
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
casey
i
have
a
question
about
the
response
you
just
gave.
i
thought
there
was
lurking
in
this
case
as
an
issue,
if
there
should
be
a
remand,
that
there
was
no
viable
reciprocity
agreement
with
illinois,
that
that
terminated
in
1989.
are
you...
are
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--abandoning
that
argument?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
a...
is
that
a
live
issue
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
would
be
no
point
in
saying
that
that's
an
issue
open
for
a
possible
remand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
should
we
get
into
an
issue
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
didn't
resolve?
it
is
an
issue.
you
may
be
right
or
wrong
on
the
merits
of
it,
but
at
least
we
would
not...
we
are
here
reviewing
a
determination
made
by
the
michigan
supreme
court.
you
are
saying
that
we
should,
at
the
same
time,
strike
at
an
issue
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
didn't
reach.
