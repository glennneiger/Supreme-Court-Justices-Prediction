now,
was
there
some
change
as
of
1992
in
connection
with
the
fee
applicable
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
i
guess
that
isn't
before
us--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
if
we
think
it
isn't
altogether
clear
and
in
fact
could
be
read
the
other
way,
don't
we
have
to
consider
chevron
deference?
because
that's
how
the
agency
has
interpreted
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
michigan.
before
1994,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
allowed
states
to
charge
interstate
motor
carriers
operating
within
their
borders
annual
registration
fees
of
up
to
$10
per
vehicle.
in
the
intermodal
surface
transportation
efficiency
act
of
1991,
congress
directed
the
icc
to
create
a
new
system
called
the
single
state
registration
system
which
caps
state
registration
fee
by
directing
the
icc
to
establish
a
fee
system
that
would
result
in
a
fee
for
each
participating
state
as
equal
to
the
fee
not
to
exceed
$10
per
vehicle
that
such
state
collected
their
charge
as
of
november
15,
1991.
the
icc
ruled
that
under
the
new
system,
the
states
could
not
terminate
reciprocity
agreement
that
were
in
placed
under
the
old
regime.
to
allow
state
to
do
so,
the
icc
concluded
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
statute's
fee-cap
provision
and
what
congress'
intent
that
the
flow
of
revenue
for
the
states
be
maintained
while
the
burden
of
the
registration
system
for
the
motor
carriers
be
reduced.
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
determine
whether
the
michigan
supreme
court
erred
in
holding
that
the
icc's
rule
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
fee-cap
provision.
we
hold
that
the
icc's
interpretation
of
the
act's
fee-cap
provision
is
a
permissible
reading
of
the
statutory
language
and
reasonably
resolves
any
ambiguity
in
it.
we
therefore,
defer
to
the
agency's
interpretation
under
the
principles
that
established
in
chevron
u.s.a.
versus
natural
resources
defense
council,
inc.
the
statute
can
easily
be
read
as
the
icc
chose,
making
that
unlawful
for
a
state
to
renounce
and
modify
a
reciprocity
agreement
so
as
to
alter
any
fee
charge
that
collected
as
of
november
15,
1991.
under
the
icc's
rule,
where
a
state
waives
its
registration
fee,
its
fee
collected
or
charged
is
zero
and
must
remain
zero.
to
allow
states
to
disavow
their
reciprocity
agreements
that
can
permit
states
to
increase
their
revenues
substantially,
a
result
that
the
icc
reasonably
believes
congress
did
not
intend.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
