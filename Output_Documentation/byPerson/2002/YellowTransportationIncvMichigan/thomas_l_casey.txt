mr.
thomas
l.
casey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
i
begin
my
principal
argument,
i
would
like
to
spend
just
a
moment
on
this...
this
point
of
the
changeover
in
michigan
from
base-plating
to
principal
place
of
business.
we
believe
it
is
not
present
in
the...
in
this
case
at
this
point.
this
case
was
litigated
on
that
point
throughout
the
michigan
courts
up
until
the
michigan
supreme
court
decision.
michigan
had
in
place
a
system
called
base-plating
where
we
imposed
fees
based
on
the
state
in
which
the
vehicle
was
licensed.
in
early
1991,
the
system
changed
from
that
base-plating
system
to
a
system
that
all
the
other
states
used
based
on
the
principal
place
of
business
of
the
truck
carrier.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
what
determined
reciprocity.
that's
correct.
and
yellow
freight
company,
at
that
time
yellow
transportation...
their
trucks
were
licensed
in
illinois,
a
state
with
which
michigan
has
reciprocity,
but
its
principal
place
of
business
of
the
parent
company
is
kansas,
a
state
with
which
michigan
does
not
have
reciprocity.
and
so
when
michigan
made
this
change
during
1991,
we
then
switched
over
and
imposed
fees
for
yellow
freight
for
the
registration
year
of
1992.
but
those
fees,
as
normal
industry
and
state
practice,
were
sent
out
in
september
of
1991
for
the
next
registration
year.
and
yellow
freight
paid
them
in
october
of
1991.
again,
that's
typical
industry
practice.
they're
assessed
and
paid
in
advance
of
the
registration
year.
the
statute
took
effect
here
in
december
of
1991.
the
statutory
language
that
we're
dealing
with
talks
about
a
fee
that
such
state
collected
or
charged
as
of
november
15th,
1991.
our
argument
on
the...
the
way
it
was
litigated
through
the
state
courts
is
that
michigan
charged
yellow
freight
before
november
15th,
1991
and
we
collected
from
yellow
freight
prior
to
19...
prior
to
november
15th,
1991.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
for
the
registration
year
1992,
we
charged
and
collected.
yellow
freight
disputed
that.
that's
the
way
it
was
litigated
up
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
it
didn't
involve
this
question
of
whether
reciprocity
was
relevant
or
irrelevant.
the
michigan...
pardon
me.
the
michigan
supreme
court
decided
it
on
a...
a
different
basis
than
the
other
state
court
opinions
had.
and
that
raised
the
question
which
this
court
granted
certiorari.
in
its
briefs,
yellow
transportation
has
implied
that
we've
somehow
waived
that
issue.
we
have
not.
we
did
not
brief
it
in
this
court
because
this
court
limited
the
grant
of
certiorari
to
the
issue
that
the
supreme
court
did
decide.
so
we...
we
believe
that
the
case
should
be
affirmed
on
the
basis
that
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
decided
it.
if
it
is
not
affirmed,
however,
we
agree
with
the
united
states
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
michigan
supreme
court
for
consideration
of
this
other
issue
which
is
still
viable.
so
turning
now
to
our
principal
argument
in
defense
of
the
michigan
supreme
court's
decision,
the
statute
required
the
icc
to
implement
a
fee
system,
to
adopt
a
fee
for
the
states,
a
fee
system
for
a
fee
not
to
exceed
$10
per
vehicle,
that
such
state
collected
or
charged
as
of
november
15th,
1991.
beginning
with
the
statutory
language,
under
chevron,
if
the
intent
of
congress
is
clear,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
the
precise
question
that
needs
to
be
addressed
here
is
what
did
congress
intend.
how
do
you
determine
the
fee?
we
believe
that
congress's
intent
is
clear.
under
the
language
of
this
statute--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--if
it...
yes,
if...
if
the
statute
is
not
clear,
then
you
proceed
to
the
second
step
of
chevron,
which
is
whether
the
agency's
interpretation
is
a
permissible
one.
we
believe
we
don't
need
to
get
to
the
second
step
of
chevron
because
the
text
of
the
statute
is
unambiguous.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the...
i
agree
the
second
step
of
chevron
is
always
an
uphill
argument,
to
overcome
an
agency
interpretation.
it's...
but
on...
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
on
the
text
of
this
statute,
we
believe
that
the
agency
interpretation
is
impermissible.
what
the...
what
the
agency
did
here
was
not
just
interpret
the
statute;
they
have,
in
fact,
rewritten
it.
they
have
imposed
conditions
in
the
statute
which
are
simply
not
there.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes,
they
did.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes,
it
does
make
it
harder.
i
agree.
but
it...
it
is
still
a
burden
that
we
believe
we
can
overcome
because
we
believe
that,
as
this
court
did
in
the
whitman
v.
ata,
it
is
possible
to
look
at
a
statute,
say
a
statute
is
ambiguous,
and
still
say
that
an
agency
interpretation
is
unreasonable.
we
believe
what
the
agency
has
done
here
is
unreasonable.
what
the
agency
has
done
here
is
add
language
to
the
statute.
they
have
imposed
the
requirement
in
the
statute
that
you
look
at
reciprocity
agreements.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
about
looking
at
reciprocity
agreements.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
about
looking
at
particular
carriers
or
how
particular
carriers
are
treated.
all
this
statute...
this
subsection
of
the
statute
requires
and
permits
is
to
look
at
what
the
state
collected
or
charged
as
of
1991,
november
15th.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
record
in
this
case
is
very
scant.
it
was
decided
on
summary
disposition
right
after
filing
of
the
complaint.
i
do
know
that
in
the
year
2000,
which
is
9
years
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
total
michigan
revenue
from
registration
fees
was
$2.7
million.
there
are
38
states
participating
in
the
single
state
registration
system.
we
have
reciprocity
agreements
with
21
of
those
states.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
but
i
don't
know
how
those
individually
break
down.
michigan
registers
approximately
5,000
trucking
carriers
each
year.
about
half
of
them
are
from
canada.
but
i
don't
know.
that's
intra
and
interstate
carriers.
the
fees
for
intrastate
carriers
are
different.
they're
$100
instead
of
$10.
but
the
record
is
very
scant
in
this
case
because
of
the
way
it
developed.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
there--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--there...
there--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--there
are
very
few
words
which
are
at
issue
here.
the
fee
that
such
state
collected
or
charged
as
of
november
15th,
1991.
we
believe
that
means
you
look
only
to
what
the
state
collected
or
charged
under
its
fee
system.
that
is,
what...
if...
if
a
state
collected
or
charged
its
fee...
it's
$10
in
michigan...
from
any
carrier
as
of
november
15th,
that
ends
the
matter.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
well,
if...
under
our
interpretation,
under...
under
the
plain
text,
we
submit
you
don't
have
to
read
in
anything.
the...
the
words,
collected
or
charged,
are
in
the
disjunctive.
they...
they're
verbs.
they
require
something.
charged
means
sent
out
a
bill
or
an
invoice.
collected
means
we
received
something.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
these...
these
fees
deal
only
with--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
statute
in
michigan
imposes
a
$10
fee
but
permits
a
waiver,
meaning
0.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
no.
there...
there...
there's
a
fee
of
$10
or
0.
some
trucks
were
charged
10.
some
were
charged
0.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i...
i
disagree.
the...
the
words,
collected
or
charged,
are
in
the
disjunctive.
so
if
the
state
either
collected
the
fee
as
of
november
or
charged
it
as
of
november--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--no
matter
to
whom.
the
fact--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
well,
it's...
it's
true.
and
that...
that
goes
to
another
part
of
our
argument.
this...
this
system
or
this
section,
subsection
(3),
is
the
section
in
which
congress
implemented
its
goal
of
preserving
state
revenues.
there...
there
are
two
goals
that
congress
had
in
passing
the
single
state
registration
system.
one
is
to
simplify
the
whole
procedure
for
the
trucking
industry
and
for
states,
and
two
was
to
preserve
state
revenues.
this
subsection
(3)
that
we're
dealing
with
is
a
section
that
preserves
state
revenues.
and
when
you
look
at
it
in
that
context,
the
text
here
deals
only
with
fees
that
the
state
collects.
there
are
other
sections
that
talk
about
payments
by
trucks
to
states.
there
are
sections
that
talk
about
carriers
specifically.
congress
didn't
use
the
word
carriers
in
this
subsection.
they
didn't
use
the
words,
payments
by
trucks
to...
or
by
carriers
to
states.
they
could
have
used
those
words,
as
they
did
in
other
subsections.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
what...
you...
earlier
you
mentioned
trucks
of
different
weights
and
things.
we're
talking
only
here
about
the
power
vehicle.
we're
not
talking
about
the
trailer
part
of
the
truck.
this
is
just
for
proof
of
insurance.
it's
a
$10
only.
there
are
other
fees
that
various
interstate
agreements
have
for
different
axle
weights,
and
that
kind
of
thing.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
well,
i
would...
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--this...
correct.
this...
this
subsection
is
part
of
a
fee
system,
and
this...
this
subsection
of
that
system
is
the
section
that
deals
with
ensuring
that
states
receive
their
revenue.
and
when
you
put
it
in
that
context
and
you
look
at
the
specific
words
of
the
statute
here,
when
you
look
at
the
collected
or
charged
in
the
disjunctive,
the
statute--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
statute--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
statute--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that's
what
the
michigan
supreme
court
said,
in
essence,
that
if
the...
if
the
state
collected
or
charged
the
$10
fee,
period,
then
the
statute
is
satisfied.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
everything
else
is
irrelevant.
pardon
me.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
it
was
made
in
a
few
paragraphs
as
one
alternative
argument
in
a
long
brief,
but
the
principal
thrust
of
the
argument...
it
was...
it
was
mentioned
in
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
rejected.
it's
in
the
appendix,
i
believe,
on
page
29
where
they
rejected
it.
but,
yes,
it
was
presented
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
it
is
still
active
in
the
michigan
courts.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
our
argument...
our
principal
argument,
the
way
the
case
was
framed
in
the
state
courts
was
this
timing
issue.
did
michigan
properly
switch
over
from
the
base-plating
to
the
principal
place
of
business
and
could
we,
therefore,
impose
the
fee
and
apply
the
statute
to
yellow
freight?
we
also
argued
as
one
of
our
alternative
arguments
that
it
didn't
matter
or
that
the...
the
statute
didn't
matter...
didn't
apply
to
specific
carriers,
that
it
applied
broadly
to
everyone.
the
supreme
court
at
oral
argument
asked...
started
asking
questions
about
this
theory
that
they
ultimately
decided
it
on.
but
the...
the
theory
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
decided
the
case
on
was,
by
no
means,
the...
the
principal
focus
of
the...
the
case
that
was
briefed
and
argued
below.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
well,
the...
we...
we
submit
that
the
fears
that
have
been
expressed
in
our
opponents'
briefs
that
these
reciprocity
agreements
will
automatically
be
abrogated
is
unfounded,
for
a
couple
of
reasons,
principally
because
those
reciprocity
agreements
were
originally
entered
into
by
states
for
economic
reasons,
totally
apart
from
the...
the
statute.
it's
not
as
though
the...
the
state
is
looking
at
this
as
a...
as
a
giant
money-making
event--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--under
their
interpretation
what
has
happened,
in
effect,
is
that
state
revenues
are
at
best
frozen,
but
in
practical
effect,
they
may
really
be
ratcheted
downward
because
of
changing
economic
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
well,
when
michigan
changed
from
a
base-plating
to
principal
place
of
business,
it
resulted
in,
on
balance,
no
economic
benefit.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
but--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--our...
the
michigan
supreme...
under
the--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--or
the
maximum
that
they
were
charging
at
the
time
that
the
statute
took
effect.
it
may
not
have
been
$10.
whatever
their
state
maximum
that
they
were
charging
at
the
time,
and
some
states
don't
have
$10.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
as
far
as
michigan
is
concerned.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
of
course.
as
we've
indicated
in
our
briefs,
michigan
has
committed
that
we
are
not
going
to
abrogate
our
reciprocity
agreements,
but
as
i...
as
i've
indicated,
there
are
economic
reasons
why
states
are
not
going
to,
in
a
wholesale,
abrogate
these...
or
these
reciprocity
agreements.
they're
not
going
to
cut
their
own
throats
by...
by
doing
that.
they...
they
have
to
live
with
these
trucking
companies.
they
have
to
live
with
these
economic
benefits
that
cause
them
to
enter
into
these
reciprocity
agreements
in
the
first
place.
and...
and
there's
another
factor
at
work
here
too.
the...
the
1994
icc
termination
act
required
congress...
or
excuse
me...
required
the
department
of
transportation
to
replace
this
entire
regulatory
scheme
as
of
1997,
but
it
has
not
happened
yet.
depending
on
the
outcome
of
this
case,
it...
this
may
serve
as
an
impetus
to
replace
this
entire
system
with
something
that
could
serve
both
the
states
and
the
trucking
industry
better
than
the
current
system.
but
the...
as...
as
you
indicated,
the
sky
is
very
unlikely
to
fall
regardless
of
what
this
court
does
if...
if
it
affirms
the
supreme
court
or
not.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
would
michigan
win
or
lose?
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
michigan
probably
would
not
win
or
lose
in
that.
it
would
probably
be
no
change--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that...
under
the--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--under
the
theory--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that's
the
theory
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
opinion.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
we...
we
have
an
agreement
with
illinois,
not
kansas.
but
we
have
not.
we
have...
michigan
has
not
terminated
any
reciprocity
agreements.
michigan
will
not.
other...
under
this
rationale,
other
states
could
as
a--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--well--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--no.
there...
in
the
past,
back
in
the
early
1980s,
there
were
formal
written
contracts
of
reciprocity.
when
michigan
passed
its
statute
in
1989
formalizing
the
$10
fee,
the
public
service
commission
terminated
those
contracts
and
contacted
every
state
with
which
it
had
reciprocity
to
verify
this.
this
whole
question
of
reciprocity
is
somewhat
uncertain.
many
states
are
not
sure
with
whom
they
have
reciprocity
because
various
state--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--michigan
has
a
reciprocity
agreement
with
illinois,
we
believe.
we...
we
operate
our
system
as
though
we...
we
give
reciprocity
to
trucks
licensed
in
illinois,
and
it's
our

mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's...
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
i
misspoke
myself,
your
honor.
thank
you.
for
purposes
of
this
case,
at
the
time
we
had
the
base-plating
system,
but
now
it's...
if...
if
we
ultimately
lose
on
that
other
point
and
we
are
stuck
with
the
base-plating
method
and
could
not...
and
the
michigan
court
rules
against
us
and
we
are
stuck
with
the
base-plating
method,
that
could
cause
a
problem
for
michigan.
let
me...
let
me
just
close
by
saying
that
we
believe
that
the
michigan
supreme
court's
decision
is
faithful
to
the
text,
results
in
a
consistent
and
a
coherent
interpretation
of
the
federal
statute,
that
is
consistent
with
the
congressional
intent,
and
we
believe
it
should
be
affirmed.
if
it
is
not
affirmed,
we
urge
the
court
to
remand
the
case
back
to
the
michigan
supreme
court
for
consideration
of
the
other
issues
that
were
not
considered
by
it.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
