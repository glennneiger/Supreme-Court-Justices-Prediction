justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
did
it
waive
the
fee
for
all
carriers
or
just
the
carriers
involved
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
it
waive
the
fee
for
all
carriers
in
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
under
your
hypothetical,
would
that
rule
have
prevented
the
company
from
repainting
its
trucks,
paint
the
blue
trucks
white
or
the
white
trucks
red,
to
get
in
a
different
category,
which
is
what
happened
here?
they
moved
from
one
place
of
registration...
one
rule
where
the
trucks
were
licensed
to
a
place
of
the
home
office
or
something
like
that.
so
could
they
have
later
repainted
their
trucks?
or
in
this
case,
could
they
2
years
later
have
moved...
changed
the...
the
rule
on...
on
which...
whether
it's
a
place
of
licensing
or
the
home
office?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
whether
the
state
could
change
its...
its...
as
it
did
here.
it
did
it
in
one
year.
could
it
have
done
the
same
thing,
say,
3
years
later?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
did
they
change
their
reciprocity
policy?
they
just
changed
the
way
of
identifying
the
state
that's
relevant
for
determining
whether
a
particular
truck
has
to
pay
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
in
the
regulations
does
it
say
that
the
state
may
not
do
what
it
did
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
did
they
change
their
reciprocity...
did
michigan
change
its
reciprocity
agreement
with
either
illinois
or
arkansas
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
you
agree
with
your
colleague.
you
take
the
position
that
they
could
not
have
changed
the...
the
state
to
which
they
give
reciprocity
by
changing
from
licensing
state
to
state
of
principal
place
of
business,
even
if
they
had
done
it
2
or
3
years
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
also
suggest
that
the...
when
you
look
at
those
words
in
the
context
of
the
whole
subparagraph
(4),
which
is
the
part--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
begins,
shall
establish
a
fee
system,
so
you're
talking
about
collected
or
charged
as
part
of
a
system.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
words,
fee
system,
are
in
the
statute
itself.
that's...
those
are
the
first
words
in
the
subsection
to
which
you're--
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
explain
one
thing
to
me
that
response...
it
relates
to
justice
scalia's
question,
too.
in
this
particular
case,
it
clearly
augmented
state
revenues
because
the
place
of...
principal
place
of
business
of
this
carrier
doesn't
have
a
reciprocity
agreement.
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
with
respect
to
other
carriers,
it
might
diminish
the
revenue
because
some
of
them...
it
might
be
just
the
reverse.
they
might
have...
that
change
might
go
from
a
state
with...
with
a...
without
a
reciprocity
agreement
to
one
that
does
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--with
respect
to
some
states,
it
would
increase
revenues;
with
respect
to
others,
it
would
decrease
revenues.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
what...
how
would
you
come
out
or
how
would
the
case
come
out
if
we
decided
that
the
statute
required
every
state
to
maintain
existing
reciprocity
agreements?
it
couldn't...
they
couldn't
charge
higher
fees
and
they
couldn't
cancel
reciprocity
agreements.
would
you
win
or
lose
if
we
interpret
it
that
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
in
this
case.
as
i
understand
it,
you
haven't
changed
any
reciprocity
agreement.
you've
merely
changed
the
method
of
deciding
which
state
is
relevant
for
the
purposes
of
granting
reciprocity
to
particular
truckers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
haven't
terminated
the
agreement,
have
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
right.
you
don't
give
reciprocity
to
trucks
licensed
in
illinois.
you
give
reciprocity
to
trucks
who
are
owned
by
companies
who
have
principal
place
of
business
in
illinois.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
ask
on
that
question?
the...
the
point
is
should
not
exceed
the
fee
that
was
charged.
if
in
the
aggregate
the
change
from
the
place
of
determining
which
state
applies,
if
the
aggregate
were
to
decrease
the
collections,
which
theoretically
it
could
be,
then
there
would
be
no
violation
of
the
statute,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
a
fee
system
it
refers
to.
