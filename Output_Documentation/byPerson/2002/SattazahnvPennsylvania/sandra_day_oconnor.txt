justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
how?
i
can't
believe
you
would
take
that
position,
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
the
state
can
go
in
afterwards
and
seek
a
redetermination
of
the
death
penalty
under
pennsylvania
law.
you've
already
told
us
the
state
can't
appeal.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
what
provision
of
state
law
could
the
state
go
in
and
ask
for
it
to
be
done
in
some
other
fashion?
i'm
startled
by
your
answer,
really.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we're
just
asking,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
how
could
it?
the
whole
premise
of
your
case
is,
as
i
understand
it,
is
as
a
matter
of
pennsylvania
law,
a
split
verdict
has
the
same
effect
as
a
unanimous
verdict
for
life.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
apparently
pennsylvania
has
interpreted
its
law
differently
on
this
point.
pennsylvania
would
say,
i
gather,
that
if
the
defendant
does
appeal
in
these
circumstances
from
his
conviction,
that
it's
all
open
to
the
state
to
seek
the
death
penalty
again.
that's
what
pennsylvania
would
say.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
don't
want
us
to
hold
that
it
can
say
that.
you
want
to
say
that
the
federal
rule
should
come
into
play
and
prevent
pennsylvania
from
saying
that.
