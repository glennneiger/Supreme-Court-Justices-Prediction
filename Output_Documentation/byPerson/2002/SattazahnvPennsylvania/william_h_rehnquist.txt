chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
01-7574,
david
allen
sattazahn
versus
pennsylvania.
before
we
begin
the
second
argument,
i
would
like
to
welcome
a
group
of
french
judges
from
the
cour...
french
cour
de
cassation,
france's
highest
court...
who
are
visiting
our
court
today.
soir
le
bienvenue,
monsieurs.
mr.
dunham,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
wasn't
the
result
of
the
same
sort
of
factual
determination
by
a
jury
that
took
place
in
bullington,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
bullington
the
verdict
was
unanimous,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
quite
a
significant
difference?
here
the
jury
did
not
come
to
a
conclusion
one
way
or
the
other.
they...
they
hung.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
they
just
hung.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
its
verdict
had
to
be
unanimous
in
order
to
have
any
effect,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
the
judge
have
imposed
a
death
sentence
here
in
view
of
a
9
to
3
verdict
of
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
it
seems
to
me
when
you
say
pennsylvania
law
says
this
and
says
that,
as
justice
kennedy
just...
that's
not
what
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
said.
you've
obviously
got
a
constitutional
argument
here,
double
jeopardy,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
shift
it
over
and
say,
this
is
what
pennsylvania
law
says.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
pennsylvania
judges
ordinarily
tell
potential
appellants
what
the
consequences
of
an
appeal
will
be?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
appealing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
a
colloquy
would
that
be?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
you
know,
i
can
see
where
a
defendant's
being
arraigned,
or
being
advised
whether
or
not
he
should
have
counsel,
there's
that
sort
of
a
colloquy,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
ordinarily
a
judge,
after
a
verdict
comes
in,
there's
no
colloquy
between
the
judge
and
the
defendant,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
not
a
fact
finding
by
the
whole
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
that's
true,
but
it's
9
out
of
12,
or
11
out
of
1,
whatever
the
case
may
be.
it's
not
the
whole
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
there
is
something
magical
about
a
jury,
a
unanimous
jury
making
a
determination,
as
was
the
case
in
bullington,
where
you
don't
just
have
a
split
in
the
jury,
the
whole
jury
comes
back
and
says
yes,
it's
only
life.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dunham.
ms.
dougherty,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
here
the
judge
who
enters
the
verdict
in
this
particular
case
does
not
do
so
because
he
concludes
that
the
circumstances...
he
simply
does
it
because
the
jury
has
come
in
9
to
3,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
doesn't
exercise
independent
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--was
this
point
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
dougherty.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
take
it
the
judge
probably
knows
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
what
the
jury
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
srinivasan.
mr.
dunham,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
dunham.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-7574,
sattazahn
versus
pennsylvania
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
