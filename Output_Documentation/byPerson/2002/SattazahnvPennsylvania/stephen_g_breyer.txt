so,
let's...
let's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
go
back
for
a
second,
can--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
we
go
back
to
where
we
started
this
whole
discussion?
i
mean,
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
you
that
we're
dealing
with
a
kind
of
analogy,
that
the
law
in
this
entire
area
is
a
matter
of
analogy.
we're
analogizing
the
penalty
phrase
of
a
death
trial
as
if
it
were
a
second
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
take
it
your
problem
is
that
working
with
analogy,
there's
quite
a
lot
here
that
suggests
a
hung
jury,
and
there
are
some
things
that
don't,
so
if
it's
like
a
hung
jury,
of
course,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
doesn't
bar
it.
if
it's
not
like
a
hung
jury,
then
it
does,
so
i'd
like
to
ask
you
to
say
as
concisely
as
you
can
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
this
whole
area
of
law,
why
is
it
not
like
a
hung
jury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
this
is
like...
it
seems
like
bullington
in
one
respect,
and
not
like
it
in
another.
it's
not
like
it
in
the
sense
that
there's
a
hung
jury.
it's
like
it,
however,
in
the
sense
that
the
person
is
faced
with
a
terrible
choice.
if
he
doesn't
appeal,
he'll
live.
if
he
does
appeal,
he
may
die.
now,
if
that
terrible
choice
is
embodied
in
the
reasons
for
an
exception
to
the
ordinary
blank
slate
rule,
that
exists
here,
so
do
you
think
that
terrible
choice
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
exception
whatsoever,
or
does
it
have
something
to
do
with
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
why
did
the
court
create
the
exception?
for,
after
all,
ordinarily,
as
you
pointed
out,
when
a
person
a
person
appeals
his
trial,
he
makes
of
his
sentence
a
blank
slate.
it
can
be
reopened.
so
why
did
the
court
say
originally
that
death
sentences
are
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens,
in
your
view,
which...
i'll
be
rather
imaginary.
i
mean,
there
isn't
a
real
situation
like
this,
but
given
the
rulings
of
this
court,
i
think
you
could
have
a
state...
at
least
not
in
my
views,
but
other's
views,
you
could
have
a
state
which
on
sentencing
left
every
question
of
fact
to
a
jury,
so
they
decide
every
possible
question
of
fact,
but
the
ultimate
decision
about
what
to
do
after
those
facts
are
found
would
lie
in
the
hands
of
a
judge,
and
in
a
system
like
that,
where
the
judge
then
said
life,
would
your
argument
still
apply,
double
jeopardy
or
not?
could
they
reopen
it,
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
very
complex,
but
we
have
special
forms
and
they
go
do
it
all.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is,
i
want
a
state
still
that
turns
over
to
the
judge
the
power
of
life
or
death,
and
what
the
judge
in
such
a
state
decides
is
life,
and
now
there
is
an
appeal
on
the
guilt
and
innocence
phase.
on...
in
your
opinion,
can
the
state
reopen
that
ultimate
judgment
which
it
put
in
the
hands
of
the
judge?
and
you
see,
of
course,
why...
what
my
next
question
will
be
is,
why
isn't
this
that
state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
everything
you
want.
i
mean,
you
know,
i'm
just
trying
to
avoid
that
question,
so
have
everything
you
want,
everything
the
constitution
requires,
everything
the
opinions
of
this
court
requires.
what
i'm
interested
in
is
not
that,
but
i'm
interested
in
the
state
putting
the
sentencing
decision
in
the
hands
of
the
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
does
that...
that's
exactly
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
exactly
the
question.
i
mean,
is
that
what
makes
the
difference?
because
the
state
has
told
the
judge
what
to
enter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
rather
than
being
discretionary,
does
that
make
a
difference
for
double
jeopardy
purposes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
win.
that
assumes
the
issue.
i
mean,
that's
the
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
you're
right
if
you
win,
but
you're
wrong
if
you
lose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
fair
to
take
into
account,
assuming
competing
analogies
of
equal
weight,
choosing
the
one
that
would
least
discourage
appeals?
i
mean,
the
real
problem
here,
i
think,
is
the
problem
of
a
person
having
a
meritorious
appeal,
but
being
afraid
to
make
it.
so
can...
am
i
free
to
take
that
into
account,
at
least,
in
trying
to
choose
between
the
analogies?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
that...
due...
is
that
not
a
factor
that
i
can
take
into
account
in
trying
to
choose
among
competing
analogies?
