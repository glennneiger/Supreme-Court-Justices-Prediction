mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
pennsylvania's
imposition
of
a
default
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
by
operation
of
law
when
the
jury
in
a
capital
sentencing
proceeding
is
unable
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict
constitutes
an
acquittal
within
the
meaning
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
we
think
the
answer
to
that
question
lies
in
the
settled
rule
that
a
hung
jury
is
not
an
acquittal
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
double
jeopardy
law
has
always
drawn
a
clear
distinction
between
hung
juries,
where
the
jury
fails
to
reach
a
resolution
of
the
case,
and
acquittals,
where
a
unanimous
jury
makes
a
factual
determination
that
the
facts
in
evidence
fail
to
establish
the
defendant's
guilt,
or
in
this--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--justice
ginsburg,
we
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
those
two.
in
the
hypothetical
statute
that
you
posit,
if
the
jury's
resolution
in
favor
of
a
life
sentence
were
not
considered
to
have
final
effect,
that
would
strike
at
the
heart
of
a
value
central
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
that
the
state
could
then
continue
to
reprosecute
the
defendant
repeatedly,
so
we
think
that
in
that
hypothetical
statute,
when
the
jury
comes
back
for
a
life
sentence,
i
don't
know
if
it's
fair
to
call
it
an
acquittal
because
an
acquittal
has
a
settled
meaning
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
but
we
think
that
determination
would
be
accorded
finality
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
but
this
case
is
different
in
a
significant
respect.
here,
pennsylvania
gave
the
defendant
the
same
opportunity
to
obtain
a
final
acquittal
in
his
favor
that
defendants
traditionally
enjoy
on
the
underlying
question
of
guilt
or
innocence,
and
that
is
that
he
could
have
obtained
a
unanimous
verdict
in
his
favor,
and
we
think
that
distinction
is
critical
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
justice
souter,
it's
true
that
the
sentencing
proceeding
in
this
case
culminated
ultimately
in
the
entry
of
a
judgment,
but
the
fact
of
a
judgment
we
think
is
not
dispositive
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
and
that's
because
the
core
premise
of
the
clean
slate
rule
is
that
the
entry
of
a
sentencing
judgment
is
not
a
double
jeopardy
disposition
that
bars
the
state
from
resentencing
in
the
event
of
a
retrial.
it's
not
the
event
of
a
judgment
that
makes
the
difference.
it's
whether
that
judgment
manifests
the
qualities
of
an
acquittal.
that's
what
bullington
holds.
so
the
question
is
whether
the
entry
of
a
life
sentence
in
this
case
manifests
the
quality
of
a
factual
acquittal,
and
we
think
it
does
not,
because
a
hung
jury
has
never
been
thought
to
constitute
an
acquittal
within
the
meaning
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy,
because
the
state
can
resentence
in
the
event
of
a
retrial.
it's
true
that
the
state
has
decided
that
it
won't
appeal,
but
the
operation
of
the
clean
slate
rule
works
such
that
when
the
defendant
occasions
a
retrial
by
successfully
appealing
his
conviction
and
sentence,
at
that
point
the
state
is
free
to
conduct
a
resentencing
and
impose
a
harsher
sentence.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
if...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
correct,
but...
of
course
that's
correct,
justice
breyer,
but
i
think
the
reason
we
should
win
is
because
the
judgment
that
was
entered
in
this
case
is
not
a
factual
acquittal
of
the
nature
that
was
considered--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
in
that
case...
it
would
depend
on
how
the
jury
were
instructed.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
i
think
if
the
jury
is
required
to
make
a
unanimous
verdict
in
either
direction,
and
the
judge
imposes
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
because
the
jury
has
made
a
unanimous
verdict,
that
would
have--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
in
that
situation
it
would
present
some
of
the
same
difficulties
that
i
was
discussing
in
reference
to
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
in
that
it's
unclear
whether
the
defendant
would
have--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right,
and
if
the
judge
articulated
it
in
his
judgment
in
a
way
that
distinguished
between
a
judgment
of
a
life
sentence
based
on
a
unanimous
jury
verdict
and
judgment
of
a
life
sentence
based
on--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
in
that
situation
we'd
have
the
same
answer
that
we
would
to
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical,
which
is
that
because
the
defendant
has
not
been
afforded
an
opportunity
to
obtain
finality,
then
the
double
jeopardy
law
would
treat
that
judgment
as
final,
and
the
state
would
not
be
permitted
in
that
situation
to
revisit
the
sentencing
judgment.
but
this
case
is
different
in
a
significant
respect,
because
here,
pennsylvania
law
draws
a
distinction
between
a
unanimous
jury
verdict
and
a
hung
jury
that
results
in
the
imposition
of
a
life
sentence,
and
petitioner
had
the
opportunity
to
obtain
a
unanimous
jury
verdict,
and,
in
fact,
when
the
jury
initially
past
its
note
to
the
judge
indicating
that
it
had
reached
an
impasse,
petitioner
immediately
moved
for
declaration
of
a
mistrial
and
discharge
of
the
jury.
and
in
that
situation
it's
clear
under
double
jeopardy
law
that
when
the
defendant
invites
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial
and
the
discharge
of
a
jury,
there's
no
double
jeopardy
prohibition
against
the
state's
conducting
a
retrial
or,
in
this
case,
the
state's
conducting
a
new
sentencing
proceeding.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
justice
souter,
because
it
depends
on
whether
state
law
makes
unanimity
the
deciding
criterion.
if
state
law
does--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--our
position
is
that
if
a
state
has
a
unanimity
requirement,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
preclude
the
state
from
enforcing
that
unanimity
requirement,
but
if
a
state
draws
no
distinction
between
a
unanimous
jury
verdict
of
acquittal
and
a
one-juror
vote
for
the
life
sentence,
then
the
double
jeopardy
clause
requires
the
state
to
honor
the
finality
of
the
judgment
in
favor
of
a
defendant.
that's
our
position
in
this
case.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
justice
breyer,
we
think
the
due
process
question
in
terms
of
undue
burden
was...
was--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it's...
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
it's
a
factor,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
there
are
important
reasons
why
a
state
would
draw
the
distinction
drawn
by
pennsylvania
in
this
case.
there
are
three
reasons
why
a
state
might
choose
not
to
conduct
a
resentencing
in
the
initial
round
of
proceedings,
but
nonetheless
to
resentence
in
the
event
of
a
retrial.
first,
as
an
interesting
closure,
the
state
might
determine
that
after
a
capital
trial
and
a
capital
sentencing
hearing,
at
that
point,
it
makes
sense
to
accept
what
is
still
a
substantial
punishment,
the
imposition
of
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment,
but
if
the
defendant
occasions
a
new
trial
by
successfully
appealing
his
conviction,
at
that
point
the
balance
of
considerations
changes.
and
in
particular,
in
terms
of
the
second
reason,
if
a
state
were
to
conduct
a
new
sentencing
proceeding
immediately
after
a
hung
jury
in
the
initial
round
of
proceedings,
the
sentencing
jury
would
come
to
the
new
sentencing
proceeding
without
having
had
the
benefit
of
standing
through...
of
sitting
through
the
capital
trial,
and
the
state
might
reasonably
conclude
that
at
that
point,
it
would
have
to
retry
much
of
the
underlying
case
on
guilt
or
innocence.
by
contrast,
when
the
defendant
occasions
a
new
trial
by
successfully
appealing
his
conviction,
the
state
will
have
selected
a
capital
jury
to
conduct
the
trial,
and
the
new
capital
jury
will
come
to
the
sentencing
proceeding
entirely
familiar
with
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case.
