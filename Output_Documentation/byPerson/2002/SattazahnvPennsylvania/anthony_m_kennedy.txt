justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
assumes
the
point
in
issue.
the
state
says
that's
not
what
we're
saying,
it's
a
default
mechanism
and
that
is
not
the
only
chance
the
state
gets
if
there's
a
default.
i...
this
isn't
a
state
law
issue
we're
arguing.
i
take
it
that
the
case
comes
to
us
on
the
assumption
that
this
is...
that
missouri
has
done
is
a
correct
interpretation
of
its
law.
i
mean,
if
the
state
supreme
court
says
so,
so
you...
for
you
to
say,
oh
well,
the
state
says
this
is
the
only
chance,
that's
the
whole
issue
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
was
a
question
of
what
was...
whether
or
not
there
was
double
jeopardy,
whether
or
not
he,
in
fact,
could
be
subject
to
a
new
trial,
but
you
are
telling
us
that
the
state
in
this
case
has
said
that
this
is
his...
the
state's
only
chance,
and
that's
not
the
way
the
state
reads
this
law.
that's
all
i
would
say.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
this
is
the
state's
only
chance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
i
do
think
you
can
say
that
in
this
case,
there
was
a
judgment
that
could
have
been
final
had
there
been
no
appeal,
and
so
therefore
it's
different
from
a
hung
jury
case
in
some
other
instances
where
there's
just
no
determination
at
all,
because
after
the
jury's
failure
to
agree,
the
judge
did
impose
a
sentence
that
might
have
become
final,
that
looked
final
in
many
instances,
in...
from
many
perspectives.
it
turned
out
that
there
was
an
appeal,
but
it
could
have
been
final
if
there
had
been
no
appeal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i
take
it
that's
part
of
your
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
i
ask
you,
do
you
know
from
the
record
in
this...
does
the
record
tell
us
in
this
case
whether
or
not
this
criminal
defendant
was
advised
of
the
risk
of
taking
an
appeal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
does
seem
a
little
odd
that...
if
you
have
case
1,
where
there
are
no
errors
and
the
defendant
is
not
in
any
way
prejudiced,
and
there
is
a
life
sentence,
that's
final.
but
in
this
case,
there
was
a
flawed
trial,
the
defendant
was
prejudiced,
but
at
this
point
he
now
faces
a
greater
sentence
for
having...
for
having
established
the...
that
prejudice.
now,
obviously,
if
we're
going
to
give
him
the
option,
we'd
say
that's
a
risk
he
takes,
but
it's
a
little
troubling
about
your--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
from
the
dynamics
of
what
the
defendant
faces
when
he's
sitting
at
the
table
and
he
hears
the
verdict
come
in,
he
hears
the
verdict
come
in,
no
liability
for
the
death
penalty,
the
judge
then
sentences
him
to
prison,
and
i
had
thought
he
would
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief.
under
your
position,
no.
in
other
words,
he's
faced
the
ordeal
of...
of
the
trial,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
you
going
to
comment
in
the
time
remaining
on
the
second
argument...
which
i
call
just
a
due
process
argument...
that
it's
just
unfair
to
condition
the
appeal
on
the
possibility
of
a
death
sentence?
surely
the
second
argument--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--made
by
your--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
does
constitute
an
acquittal
of
the
death
penalty
if
there's
no
appeal.
