justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
that's
true,
then
they
certainly
can't
go
in
and...
and
ask
for
another
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so,
you
misspoke
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about...
actually,
two
questions
about
bullington?
is
it
not...
am
i
correct
in
recalling
that
in
bullington,
the
state
had
the
same...
the
jury
had
the
same
two
options,
it
either
could
have
found
unanimously
for
the
death
penalty,
or
either
unanimously
or
by
a
split
verdict,
it
could
have
refused
to
find
the
death
penalty
and
the
consequence
under
missouri
law
would
have
been
the
life
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
exactly
like
this
case
in
that
respect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
also
not
true
that
in
that
case,
we
can't
tell
whether
the
jury
verdict
was
finding
no
aggravating
circumstances,
or
a
finding
that
no
matter
what
the
aggravating
circumstances
are,
we're
not
going
to
impose
the
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they...
so
that
their...
the
double
jeopardy
did
not
rest
on
the
fact
there
was
a
finding
of
fact,
but
rather,
there
was
an
ultimate
judgment
that
death
is
the
inappropriate
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you...
can
i
interrupt
with
just
one
question?
are
there
any
other
double
jeopardy...
i
mean,
i
don't...
are
there
any
other
hung
jury
situations,
other
than
this
very
narrow
category,
in
which
the
prosecutor
does
not
have
the
option
to
go
ahead
and
seek
a
second
trial?
see,
here
you...
unless
the
defendant
appeals,
a
prosecutor
can't
do
anything
about
it
here.
is
there
any
other
hung
jury
situation
in
which
the
prosecutor's
hands
are
tied
in
that
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
but
a
hung
jury
is
not
quite
like
a
plea
bargain,
though.
and
that's
what
you're
talking
about,
isn't
it?
if
the
agreement
is
set
aside,
then
of
course
everybody
starts
from
scratch,
but
not...
but
when
you've
got
a
hung
jury,
normally
the
prosecutor
has
the
choice
of
whether
to
go
ahead
and
retry
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just...
let
me
ask
just
one
more
question,
then
i'll
be
through.
i
did
not
remember...
your
opponent
said
that
there
was
actually
a
finding
of
an
aggravating
circumstance
in
bullington.
was
he
correct
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
would
have
been
eligibility
for
the
death
penalty
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
i
said
i
wouldn't
ask
another
question.
i
would
like
to
ask
one
more.
if
the
jury
in
this
case
had
been
unanimous
and
said
life
rather
than
death,
would
the
judgment
entered
by
the
trial
court
have
been
any
different
than
the
judgment
it
actually
did
enter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no,
i'm
asking,
would
the
form
of
the
judgment,
the
language
used
by
the
trial
judge
in
entering
judgment,
would
it
have
been
any
different
from
the
language
it
did
use
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is,
the
language
of
the
judgment
would
have
been
any
different
within
the
two
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
counsel,
supposing
the
state
law
had
a
provision
in
it
that
the
votes
of
the
jurors
shall
remain
secret,
and
the
only
thing
that
shall
become
public
is
the
judgment,
what
would
you
do
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they're
instructed
just
as
they
were
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
protecting
the
privacy
of
the
jurors,
we're
just
not
going
to
let
the
public
know
how
they
voted,
and
that
we
just
have
a
judgment
out
there.
what
do
you
do
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
doesn't...
the
"because"
doesn't
follow,
because
you
don't
know
on
the
record
i'm
hypothesizing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
in
my
hypothesis
he
enters
exactly
the
same
judgment
he
entered
here,
and
he
just
says
i'm...
let's
close
the
files
on
this
case
so
the
public
won't
know
how
the
jury
voted.
