ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
bullington,
this
court
examined
its
holding
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
apply
to
sentencing
proceedings,
and
carved
out
a
limited
exception
which
was
based
on
the
findings
made
by
a
sentencer
in
a
capital
sentencing
proceeding.
the
exception
does
not
arise
out
of
the
proceeding
itself.
it
arises
out
of
these
findings,
which
distinguish
it
from
a
traditional
sentencing
procedure.
this
is
the
only
conclusion
which
is
consistent
with
existing
double
jeopardy
jurisprudence.
the
court
has
never
applied
double
jeopardy
protections
to
traditional
sentencing
procedures,
because--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--well,
double
jeopardy...
the
double
jeopardy
clause
doesn't
preclude
a
defendant
having
to
make
choices
in
making
a
decision,
and
there's
nothing
final
about
the
life
sentence
that's
imposed
by
a
default
judgment
under
the
pennsylvania
statute.
it's
no
different
than
any
other
sentence
imposed
at
the
end
of
a
traditional
sentencing
proceeding.
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
no,
your
honor.
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
under
double
jeopardy
analysis,
i
don't
believe
it
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
the
defendant
also,
upon
appeal--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--because
the
proceeding
itself
requires
a
finding.
it
leads
to
a
finding.
it
leads
to
an
acquittal
in
a
way
that
other
traditional
sentencing
proceedings
do
not,
and
when
someone
has
been
acquitted
of
the
death
penalty,
then
the
state...
that
would
be
precluded
by
double
jeopardy
purposes
for
going
back,
because
of
the
finality
that
attaches
to
an
acquittal,
not
to
the
final
judgment,
not
to
a
sentence
that's
imposed
as
the
result
of...
that
terminates
a
proceeding,
certainly,
but
it
doesn't
have
that
same
finality
that
the
court
has
always
accorded
to
an
acquittal,
and--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--exactly,
and
if
he
stops
and
is
satisfied
with
a
life
sentence
instead
of
trying
to
get
an
acquittal,
which
is
the
result
of
possibly
seeking
another
trial,
is
that
he
could
walk
out
of
the
courtroom
an
innocent
man
on
second
trial.
and
that
is
a
choice,
but
i
believe
under
chaffin
this
court
has
not
ruled
out
the
defendant
having
to
make
choices
like
that.
no
matter
how
serious,
how
tough
the
choice
is--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--i
believe
the
answer
is
no.
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
however,
i
think
it's
comparable
to
the
guilty
plea
situation,
where
the
government
could
forego
seeking
death
in
order
to...
for
an
agreement
to
life,
and
the
commonwealth...
the
state
would
not
be
able
to
appeal
that
imposition
of
the
life
sentence.
however,
if
the
defendant
appeals
and
gets
his
sentence,
gets
his
guilty
plea
withdrawn,
the
state
would
not
be
precluded
in
that
case
from
seeking
death
at
the
trial.
so
i
think
the
situation
is
along
those
lines.
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
the
situation
in
this
case,
and
the
situation
for
the
exception
in
bullington,
revolved
around
the
findings
by
the
jury,
and
it
revolved
around
the
idea
of
an
acquittal,
not
a
sentence,
and
that
was
pointed
out
further
in
rumsey,
where
the
court
talked
about,
the
sentence
was
based
on
findings
which
entitled
the
defendant
to
a
life
sentence,
and
again
in
poland--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
there
may
have
been
a
finding,
but
it
may
have
been
outweighed.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
remember
that,
but
it
may
have
been
outweighed
by
the
mitigating--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--but
the
ultimate
finding
of
the
jury
was
that
they
were...
that
they
acquitted
the
defendant
based
on
their
weighing
situation.
and
poland
further
limited
bullington
and
specifically
talked
about
when
there
is
not
an
acquittal,
then
bullington...
the
bullington
exception
does
not
apply,
and--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
know
that
that
would
qualify
as
an
acquittal.
that
may
be
a
decision
made
by
the
state
legislature,
but
the
fact
that
one
person
would
hold
out
for
life...
an
acquittal
is,
traditionally
has
been
looked
at
as
a
finding
of
innocence,
and
a
finding...
the
court
has
generally
recognized
it
as
finding
innocence
based
on
the
evidence
in
the
record,
and
it's
based
on...
the
whole
point
of
the
jury
system
is
to
reach
a
collective
agreement,
a
collective
judgment
by
the
community,
and
one
person
holding
out
for
life
does
not
possibly
affect
the
conscience
of
the
community
on
that
sentence.
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
i
don't
think
that
would
still
have
the
finality
of
an
acquittal
under
this
court's
double
jeopardy
jurisprudence,
and
of
course,
the
hypothetical
doesn't
apply
in
this
situation,
because
that's
not
what
pennsylvania
said,
but
i
don't
believe
that
one
juror
holding
out
for
life
could
possibly
garner
that
finality
that
an
acquittal
has,
and
if...
i
believe
there
are
certainly...
there
might
be...
there
would
be
an
argument
in
that
case
that
if
the
defendant
appealed,
that--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--a
state
could
do
that.
i
just
don't
believe
that
that
legislative
decision
would
have
the
same
finality
as...
as
an
acquittal,
because
an
acquittal
is
based
upon
a
collective
judgment
of
the
community
on
the
ultimate
question
of--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--i...
well,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
a
little...
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
your
question.
there's
a
definite
different
in
that
pennsylvania
requires
a
unanimous
jury
to
reach
a
verdict,
and
therefore,
pennsylvania
is
saying
unless
the
jury...
all
of
the
jury
agrees...
then
there
is
no
verdict.
there's
no
acquittal.
there's
no
conviction.
it's
a
hung
jury.
i
don't
feel
that
i
answered
your
question,
but
i'm
not
sure
how
to
better
answer
it.
i
do
believe
that
there--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--well,
there's
a
difference
in
language.
i
don't
know
that
there's
a
difference
in
effect,
in
the
double
jeopardy
concept
of
acquittal,
the
finality
that
should
be
accorded
that
judgment.
the...
pennsylvania's
position,
of
course,
is
that
without
these
findings
made
by
a
jury,
that
under
bullington
analysis,
then
double
jeopardy
would
not
bar
retrial
for
the
maximum
sentence.
you're
right
back
at
the
results
obtained
from
the
traditional
sentencing
proceeding.
the
imposition
of
a
particular
sentence,
in
this
case
life,
is
not
an
acquittal
of
any
more
serious
sentence
that
could
have
been
imposed
and,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
difrancesco
as
one
example,
the
pronouncement
of
sentence
simply
does
not
have
the
qualities
of
constitutional
finality
that
attend
an
acquittal.
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
life
would
have
been
imposed,
but
it
would
have
been
imposed
for
a
different
reason.
the
jury--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--well,
it
would
have
been
based
on
the
unanimous
verdict
of
the
jury.
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
it
would
have
been
a
life
sentence
in
both
cases.
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
yes,
your
honor.
if
there's
no
acquittal--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--then
bullington
doesn't
apply,
and
that's
what
would
be
different
in
the
sentence.
there
would
be
no
acquittal.
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
well,
the
facts
that
need
to
be
found
in
a
capital
sentencing
proceeding--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--my
problem
in
answering
the
question,
justice
breyer,
is
i'm
not
sure
what
facts
the
jury
is--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--he
comes
in
because...
that's
right.
he
has
no
discretion.
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
he
has--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--well--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--well,
i
think
it...
i
think
it
does,
and
to
go
back
to
your
hypothetical,
my
problem
in
answering
that
question,
if
the
jury,
in
fact,
has
found
as
fact
that
the
mitigating
circumstances
outweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances,
then
i
believe
that
would
be
an
acquittal.
if
the
jury's
findings
were
made
in
that
way,
and
the
judge
was...
the
judge
had
to
rely
on
those
findings
in
order
to
impose
that
sentence,
then
i
believe
that
that
would
be
an
acquittal,
which
would
distinguish
it
from
the
case
we
have
here.
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
because
an
acquittal
has
always...
the
definition
of
acquittal
has
always
been
based
on
a
finding
of
innocence,
on
a
finding
that
the
state
hasn't
proved
its
case,
and
if
there
are
no
such
findings...
and
that's
why
double
jeopardy
hasn't
been
applied
to
traditional
sentencing
proceedings,
and
if
you
don't
have
those
findings,
then
there's
no
basis
to
justify
the
acquittal,
which
would
bar
it
under
double
jeopardy.
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
well--
ms.
iva
c.
dougherty
--it
was
raised.
it
was
never...
it
was
raised.
it
was
not
specifically
addressed
in
this
fashion
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
but
it
was
before
the
court
to
address.
the
argument
seems
to
be
that
somehow
the
sentence
can
be
separated
from
the
conviction,
and
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case.
due
process...
procedural
due
process
requires
notice
and
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
sattazahn
had
that
throughout
these
proceedings.
substantive
due
process,
as
this
court
stated
in
albright
versus
oliver,
it's
reluctant
to
expand
this
generalized
notion
of
substantive
due
process,
and
therefore,
if
there's
a
specific
amendment
that
applies
to
the
states
that
addresses
the
issue,
that's
what
should...
that's
how
the
claim
should
be
reviewed.
in
this
case,
double
jeopardy
definitely
applies
to
the
states,
and
it
seems
that
double
jeopardy
covers
all
the
concerns
that
are
raised
in
the
defendant's
due
process
and
in
petitioner's
due
process
argument.
therefore,
the
only
way
that
the
defendant
should
not
face
a
clean
slate
on
resentencing
on
retrial
is
the
bullington
double
jeopardy
exception,
not
any
due
process
claim.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
