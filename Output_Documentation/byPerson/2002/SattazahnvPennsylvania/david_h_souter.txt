justice
david
h.
souter
--one
of
the
things
that
we
worry
about
in
enforcing
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
the
possibility
that
without
its
protection,
the
state,
in
effect,
could
fail
in
its
attempts
and
try
again
and
again
and
again
and
again.
is
there
any
risk
of
that
with
respect
to
the
penalty
determination
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
any
greater
risk
of
the
state's
being...
bringing
repetitive,
making
repetitive
attempts
to
get
the
death
penalty
against
a
given
defendant?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
a
question
that
ultimately
i
intended
to
ask
counsel
on
the
other
side,
but
what's
your
position
on
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
lose,
is
that,
in
your
judgment,
the
consequence?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
even
in
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
does
not
appeal
the
underlying
conviction,
the
state
can
say,
we'd
simply
like
to
try
again
on
penalty?
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
a
plausible
position
under
pennsylvania
law,
because
i...
and
here
i'm
really
at
sea,
but
we've
been
told
that
the
state
has
no
appeal
from
the
sentence.
the
state
cannot
go
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
say
something
was
wrong
in
the
sentencing
proceeding
and
we
should
have
another
opportunity,
so
how
would
the
state
get
its
second
choice?
do
you
think
it
would
be
inconsistent
under
state
law
for
the
state
simply
to
go
to
the
trial
judge
and
say
we'd
like
you
to
vacate
that
judgment
insofar...
or
the
verdict...
insofar
as
it
calls
for
a
life
sentence
and
let
us
try
again?
do
you
think
that
is
open
to
the
state
under
state
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
they
could
follow
the
course
that
i
just
suggested,
which
would
give
them
a
repetitive
opportunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i'm
just
asking
a
question
of
state
law.
do
you
think
the
state
law
can
be
read
in
a
way
that
would
allow
them
to
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
is
it
final
if
he
does
not
appeal?
i
mean,
just
to
clear
up
that
issue
upon
which
we
got
an
answer
that
surprised
us
from
counsel
on
the
other
side,
if
he
does
not
appeal,
under
pennsylvania
law,
can
the
state
go,
in
effect,
before
the
judge
again
and
say
we
would
like
to
have
another
attempt
to
get
the
death
penalty?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
that
important?
why
is
it
important
for
drawing
a
double
jeopardy
line
that
in
the
poland
situation
a
jury
makes
a
unanimous
determination,
or
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
a
judge
that
has
the
power
makes
the
ultimate
determination
himself?
if
the
judgment
can
otherwise
be
attacked
on
the
underlying
conviction,
why
should
it
make
a
difference
for
double
jeopardy
on
sentence
that
the
judgment
of
life
rests
upon
these
kinds
of
determinations
rather
than
the
operation
of
law
which
we
have?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
that
distinction
be
more
critical
than
the
so-called
judgment
distinction?
in
other
words,
in
your...
i
understand
you
to
be
arguing,
as
pennsylvania
argued,
that
the
line
traditionally
is
drawn
based
on
whether
there
was
an
acquittal
or
wasn't
an
acquittal...
an
acquittal
versus
a
hung
jury,
but
that
line
historically
also
is
drawn,
in
fact,
depending
on
whether
the
jury's
determination
results
in
a
judgment
or
not.
here,
we
have
a
judgment.
why
should
we
draw
the
line
based
on
acquittal
rather
than
drawing
the
line
based
on
judgment?
there
is
a
tradition
for
each.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the...
isn't
the
only
distinction
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
between
that
case...
the
case
that
he
posits...
and
this
one,
the
secrecy.
and
i
don't
know
why
the
secrecy
should
make
a
difference,
and
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
answer
by
saying,
look,
what
is
necessary
in
order
to
implicate
double
jeopardy
is
the
unanimous
acquittal
by
the
fact-finder,
and
if
the
record
does
not
manifest
that
unanimous
acquittal,
then,
in
fact,
there
would
be
no
double
jeopardy
bar
to
trying
him
on
the
sentence
again.
why
hasn't
that
got
to
be
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
on
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
it
does
not.
his
hypothetical
was,
it's
just
like
this
case
except
that
there's
a
secrecy
requirement,
so
we
don't
know.
and...
and
all
we
know
is
that
yes,
there
ultimately
was
one
or
the
other
condition
necessary
and
sufficient...
sufficient,
rather...
to
support
the
judgment
of
life,
but
we
don't
know
which
one
it
was,
and
i
would
have
thought
that
on
your
position
you
would
say
unless
it
affirmatively
appears
that
there
was
an
acquittal
by
the
unanimous
jury,
there
would
be
no
double
jeopardy
bar.
make
it
just
like
this
case.
