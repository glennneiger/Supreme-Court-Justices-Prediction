it
would
seem
that
there
isn't

or
the
only

circumstance...
in
which
the
state
could
see
the...
seek
the
death
penalty
again
is
the
one
that
we
have
in
this
case,
in
which
the
defendant
takes
the
appeal
on
some
underlying
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence,
and
it's
only
then,
if
he
is
successful,
that
the
state
would,
on
its
view
and
on
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court's
view,
have
another
shot
at
getting
the
death
penalty.
