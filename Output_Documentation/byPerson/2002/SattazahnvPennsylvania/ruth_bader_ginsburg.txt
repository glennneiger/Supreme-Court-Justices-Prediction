justice
ruth
bader

but
you
agree--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dunham,
do
i
understand
that
essentially
what
you
are
arguing
is
that
we
have
here,
to
put
it
in
simple
terms,
claim
preclusion
but
not
issue
preclusion?
you
agree
that
this
jury
found
nothing,
so
that
if
the
pennsylvania
law
had
been...
when
the
jury
comes
in
9
to
3
or
7
to
2,
whatever...
when
it
comes
in
that
way,
that
the
pennsylvania
law
had
been
new
trial
on
penalty,
you
would
have
no
double
jeopardy
claim.
so
you're
relying
on
the
entry
of
a
mandatory
judgment
for
life
to
effect
basically
claim
preclusion,
although
you
admit
there's
no
issue
preclusion.
that
is,
no
issue
has
been
found
by
anyone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
jury--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--didn't
do
anything
but
say
we
can't
agree.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
really
are
arguing
for
claim
preclusion,
because
in
the
two
juries...
the
jury
in
a
state
that
says,
okay,
we
do
a
retrial
on
sentence,
and
pennsylvania...
the
two
juries
are
doing
an
identical
thing.
you're
giving
it
a
different
label
because
pennsylvania
law
precludes
the
claim,
but
the
two
juries
have
done
precisely
the
same
thing,
so...
and
the
difference
between
this
case
and
bullington,
of
course,
is
that
there
was
a
determination,
a
fact
determination
by
the
fact-finder
for
life
rather
than
death.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
you
can't
equate
those
two
cases,
so
you
have
to
be
relying
on
claim
preclusion
because
a
judgment
has
been
entered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
would
go
even
if
it
had
been
1
for
life
and
11
for
death,
so
you've
repeated
a
few
times
the
9
to
3
for
life,
but
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
it
was
lopsided
the
other
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dunham,
maybe
i'm
misunderstanding
the
pennsylvania
law,
but
i
thought
that
this
position,
we
enter
judgment
of
life,
it
favors
defendants.
that
is,
the
state
is
saying
if
nothing
further
happens
we're
not
going
to
subject
this
defendant
to
the
chance
of
getting
death
on
a
resentencing
hearing.
we're
going
to
give
him
life.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
chooses
to
appeal
from
the
guilt
part
on,
say,
a
charge
error,
as
was
the
case
here,
then
we're
no
longer
going
to
give
him
that
benefit.
we
did
it
on
the
notion
that
the
thing
would
be
over.
he
wouldn't
be
subject
to
death,
but
now
he's
taking,
in
effect,
advantage
of
something
we
did
to
benefit
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
we
had
a
state
with
a
system
that
said,
if
any...
and
i
think
some
do
have
this
system...
if
any
one
juror
votes
for
life,
then
the
sentence
shall
be
life.
suppose
we
had
that
system,
and
the
jury
comes
in
and
says,
we're
11
to
1
for
death.
the
judge
enters
judgment
for
life.
in
that
case,
if
the
guilt...
if
it's
an
appeal
from
the
guilt
determination,
and
it's
successful,
then
there
wouldn't
be...
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
reopening
the
death-life
decision,
would
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you
say
it
would
make
no
difference
if,
instead
of
in
this
case,
where
the
legal
consequence
following...
follows
a
jury
disagreement,
a
state
that
says
we
make,
in
effect,
each
juror
the
decisionmaker
on
the
life-death
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not?
if
the
state
law
sets
up
that
single
juror
in
the
same
way
that
it
sets
up
a
single
judge,
if
the
trial
is
before
the
judge...
if
the
sentencing
trial
is
before
the
judge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
do
you
think
that
that
case
that
i
gave
you,
where
the
state
law
says
one
juror
for
life
is
enough,
and
pennsylvania,
do
you
think
there's
any
significant
distinction
between
those
two
laws?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
take
it
you
do
believe
that
there
is
a
difference
between
those
two
situations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
how
you
would
respond
to
my
question
about
the
state
that
has
a
system,
any
one
juror
who
votes
for
life,
if
there's
any
one
juror,
it's
a
life
sentence,
and
this
case?
is
there
a
distinction
between
those
two
for
double
jeopardy
purposes?
