justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
petitioner,
david
allen
sattazahn
was
convicted
of
first-degree
murder
in
connection
with
the
robbery
of
a
restaurant.
that
conviction
was
followed
by
a
penalty
phase
trial
to
determine
whether
he
would
be
sentenced
to
death.
under
pennsylvania
law,
the
verdict
in
the
penalty
phase
of
capital
proceedings
must
be
death
if
the
jury
unanimously
finds
at
least
one
aggravating
circumstance
and
no
mitigating
circumstance
or
if
it
finds
one
or
more
aggravating
circumstances
outweighing
any
mitigating
circumstances,
but
it
must
be
life
imprisonment
in
all
other
instances.
pennsylvania
law
further
provides
that
if
the
jury
cannot
unanimously
agree
on
the
sentence,
the
court
may
discharge
the
jury
and
must
then
enter
a
life
sentence.
petitioner’s
penalty
phase
jury
reported
to
the
trial
judge
that
it
was
hopelessly
deadlocked
nine
to
three
for
life.
following
petitioner’s
motion
to
discharge
the
jury,
the
court
did
so
and
entered
as
pennsylvania
law
required
a
life
sentence.
petitioner,
however,
appealed
his
conviction.
the
pennsylvania
superior
court
reversed
the
first-degree
murder
conviction
and
remanded
for
a
new
trial.
at
the
second
trial
pennsylvania
again
sought
the
death
penalty
and
the
jury
again
convicted
petitioner
but
this
time
the
penalty
phase
jury
unanimously
agreed
upon
a
death
sentence.
the
issue
presented
in
the
case
is
obvious
whether
even
double
jeopardy
clause
or
the
due
process
clause
barred
pennsylvania
from
seeking
the
death
penalty
in
petitioner’s
retrial.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
answered
in
the
negative.
we
affirm.
long
ago,
in
a
case
called
stroud
versus
united
states,
this
court
made
clear
that
where
a
defendant
who
was
convicted
of
murder
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
succeeds
in
having
the
conviction
set
aside
on
appeal,
the
life
sentence
imposed
in
connection
with
the
initial
conviction
does
not
by
itself
raise
a
double
jeopardy
bar
to
the
imposition
of
a
death
sentence
on
retrial.
stroud,
however,
involved
only
one
trial
for
the
substantive
offense
of
murder.
once
conviction
of
that
offense
was
obtained,
no
further
facts
had
to
be
found
in
order
to
render
the
defendant
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
our
more
recent
constitutional
jurisprudence
requires
such
additional
fact
finding
at
the
penalty
stage
and
a
line
of
cases
commencing
with
bullington
versus
missouri
holds
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
can
apply
to
capital
sentencing
proceedings
that
“have
the
hallmarks
of
the
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence”.
those
cases,
however,
make
clear
that
the
relevant
inquiry
to
determine
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
implicated
is
not
simply
whether
the
defendant
received
a
life
sentence
the
first
time
around
but
rather,
whether
that
first
life
sentence
was
an
“acquittal”
based
on
findings
sufficient
to
establish
legal
entitlement
to
the
life
sentence
that
is
findings
to
the
effect
that
the
government
failed
to
prove
one
or
more
aggravating
circumstances
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
here,
there
was
no
such
acquittal
in
petitioner’s
first
capital
sentencing
proceeding.
the
jury
did
not
acquit
petitioner
of
death
but
was
deadlocked.
it
made
no
findings
with
respect
to
the
alleged
aggravating
circumstance.
that
result
or
non
result
cannot
fairly
be
called
an
acquittal
based
on
findings
sufficient
to
establish
legal
entitlement
to
a
life
sentence.
neither
was
the
entry
of
a
life
sentence
by
the
judge
an
acquittal,
under
pennsylvania
scheme,
the
judge
has
no
discretion
to
fashion
a
sentence
once
he
finds
the
jury
deadlocked.
he
makes
not
findings
and
resolves
no
factual
matters.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
made
clear
that
the
statutorily
required
entry
of
a
life
sentence
does
not
as
a
matter
of
pennsylvania
law
confer
an
entitlement
to
that
sentence
as
a
maximum,
and
there
are
of
course,
valid
reasons
why
pennsylvania
might
choose
to
have
a
law
that
confers
only
a
conditional
entitlement
subject
to
defeasance
if
the
conviction
is
reversed.
the
state’s
simple
interest
in
closure
might
make
it
willing
to
accept
the
default
penalty
of
life
imprisonment
when
the
conviction
is
affirmed
and
the
case
is,
except
for
that
issue,
at
an
end
but
unwilling
to
do
so
when
the
case
has
to
be
retried
anyway,
and
its
interest
in
conservation
of
resources
might
make
it
willing
to
leave
the
sentencing
issue
unresolved
and
the
default
life
sentence
in
place
where
the
cost
of
resolving
it
is
the
empanelling
of
a
new
jury
and
in
all
likelihood,
a
repetition
of
much
of
the
guilt
phase
of
the
first
trial
though
it
is
eager
to
attend
to
that
unfinished
business
if
there
is
to
be
a
new
trial
and
a
new
jury
anyway.
petitioner
also
contends
that
the
common
wealth
unfairly
deprived
him
of
his
life
and
liberty
interests
in
the
life
sentence
resulting
from
his
first
sentencing.
we
think
not.
nothing
indicates
that
any
life
or
liberty
interest
that
pennsylvania
law
may
have
given
petitioner
in
the
life
sentence
imposed
after
his
first
capital
sentencing
proceeding
was
somehow
immutable.
he
was
deprived
of
any
such
interest
only
by
operation
of
the
process
he
invoked
to
invalidate
the
underlying
first-degree
murder
conviction
on
which
it
was
based.
we
decline
petitioner’s
invitation
to
hold
that
the
due
process
clause
provides
greater
double
jeopardy
protection
than
does
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
for
these
reasons
and
others
discussed
in
an
opinion
released
today,
we
hold
that
neither
the
double
jeopardy
clause
nor
the
due
process
clause
barred
pennsylvania
from
seeking
to
impose
the
death
penalty
at
petitioner’s
retrial.
