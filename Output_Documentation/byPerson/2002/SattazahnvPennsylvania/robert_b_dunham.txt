mr.
robert
b.
dunham
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
double
jeopardy
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
statutorily
mandated
judgment
of
life
that
was
entered
in
david
sattazahn's
first
capital
trial
is,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
a
judgment
that
precludes
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
from
seeking
and
obtaining
the
death
penalty
in
a
second
capital
trial.
pennsylvania
was
afforded
one
fair
opportunity
to
sentence
mr.
sattazahn
to
death,
and
the
jury
in
his
case
decided,
in
accordance
with
the
trial
court's
instructions,
in
accordance
with
the
verdict
slip,
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
pennsylvania,
to
report
to
the
court
the
presence
of
circumstances
that
it
knew
would
compel
the
court
to
impose
a
life
sentence.
that
judgment
of
life
having
been
imposed
after
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
try,
pennsylvania
could
not
seek
death
against
mr.
sattazahn
on
retrial.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
no,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
pennsylvania...
the
factual
difference
between
pennsylvania
and
missouri
is
the
following,
your
honor.
in
pennsylvania...
actually
in
both
states...
if
there's
a
unanimous
jury
verdict,
that's
the
verdict
that
the
court
imposes,
that's
the
sentence
the
court
imposes.
in
both
states,
if
the
jury
does
not
reach
a
unanimous
verdict,
then
the
court
is
required
as
a
matter
of
law
to
impose
a
life
sentence,
so
here,
when
the
jury
did
not...
when
the
jury
sent
its
note
back
saying
it
was
9
to
3
in
favor
of
life,
the
court
was
required
as
a
matter
of
pennsylvania
law
to
impose
a
life
sentence.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
well,
your
honor,
they
did
not
hang
in
the
traditional
sense
of
a
hung
jury,
and
the
distinction
between
this
case
and
a
hung
jury
case
is
the
following.
the
traditional
hung
jury
case,
the
lack
of...
when
there's
an
absence
of
unanimity
what
happens
is,
the
trial
court
discontinues
the
proceedings
and
jeopardy
never
terminates,
and
the
proceedings
are
sent
back
to
start
over.
here,
as
a
matter
of
pennsylvania
law,
the
legislature
determined
in
advance,
saw
the
possibility
of
a
nonunanimous
jury
as
one
of
the
foreseeable
outcomes
of
the
trial
and
in
so
doing
it
said,
well,
if
that
happens,
what
we're
going
to
do
is
say,
the
state
only
gets
one
chance.
if
the
state
does
not
meet
its
burden
of
proving
to
all
twelve
jurors
that
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
mitigating
circumstances,
then,
well,
that's
the
only
chance
they
get,
and
if
they
don't
do
that--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--well,
your
honor,
this
is
like
smalis
versus
pennsylvania,
another
double
jeopardy
case
in
pennsylvania
that
was
a
decade
before,
in
which
pennsylvania...
this
court
correctly
found
that
pennsylvania
could
say
what
was
necessary
for
the
court
to
enter
a
judgment--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--but
not
say
what
the
constitutional--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--this
is
what
the
statute
says,
your
honor.
what
the
statute...
the
statute
is
very
clear
when...
when
you
look
at--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--your
honor,
what
the
statute
says...
that's
true,
the
statute
does
not
expressly
say
this
is
your
only
chance.
what
the
statute
says,
it
delineates
the
two
circumstances,
and
the
only
two
circumstances
in
which
a
death
sentence
may
be
imposed,
and
then
it
says,
the
verdict
must
be
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
in
all
other
cases.
in
so
doing,
what
the
pennsylvania
legislature
determined
was
that
unless...
unless
the
prosecution
was
able
to
prove
its
case
for
death,
that
is,
that
aggravating
circumstances
outweighed
mitigating
circumstances,
and
was
able
to
prove
its
case
for
death
unanimously,
then
the
outcome
would
be
a
life
sentence.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
there's
no
issue
preclusion
with
respect
to
aggravating
and
circumstance...
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
your
honor,
but
what's
clear
is
that
this
jury
had
made
a
legally
binding
factual
determination
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
life
or
death,
and--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--no,
your
honor.
this
jury
did
split
9
to
3.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
the
verdict
had
to
be
unanimous
for
the
jury
verdict
to
be
imposed,
but
by
operation
of
pennsylvania
law,
when...
the
judge
is
then
given
the
opportunity
to
make
two
predicate
factual
determinations,
and
if
those
predicate
factual
determinations
are
found...
and
those
are
determinations
relating
to
whether
or
not
the
state
had
proven
its
case...
then
the
judge
must
impose
a
life
sentence.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
no,
it
could
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court...
yes,
your
honor.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
can
say
what
the
operative
effects
of
the
statute
are,
and
what
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
said
the
operative
effects
of
the
statute
are
is
that
when
the
jury
is
not
unanimous,
then
the
judge
must
take
a
particular
step,
and
that
is
to
impose
the
mandatory
life
sentence.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
well,
in
fact,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--well,
justice
kennedy,
what
pennsylvania
does
is,
pennsylvania
forecloses
any
appeal
of
the
sentencing
determination.
when
the
defendant
receives
a
life
sentence
at
the
close
of
this
trial-like
capital
sentencing
proceeding
the
state
does
not
have
authority
to
appeal
and,
of
course,
the
defendant
has
no
reason
to
appeal
because
he
has...
he's
come
out
with
a
life
sentence.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
he
was
advised
of
that
risk.
in
fact,
the
record...
everything
that
we
can
see
on
the
record,
from
the
record
there
is
nothing
that
says
anywhere
that
david
sattazahn
was
told
that
if
he
took
an
appeal,
he
risked
his
life,
and
in
fact--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--well,
pennsylvania
judges
tell
them
what
rights
that
they
are
waiving,
so--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--yes,
your
honor.
but...
but
what
was--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--i--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--that's
what
i
was
thinking
of,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
no,
your
honor.
there's
a
colloquy
as
to
you
have
a
certain
number
of
days
to
file
post
verdict
motions,
you
have
the
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel,
and
so
forth.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
well,
your
honor,
if
the
judgment
is
not
a
final
judgment
sentence,
i
don't
see
as
a
matter
of
double
jeopardy
jurisprudence
what
would
prevent
the
state
of
pennsylvania
from
then
saying,
for
every
other
defendant
who
had
received
a
life
sentence
solely
by
virtue
of
a
split
jury,
why
that
would
not
be
subject
to
further
proceedings.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
i
think
that--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--i
think
that's--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--your
honor,
under
double
jeopardy
law,
yes,
i
think
that
would
be
the
risk--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--i
think
the
suggestion
would
be...
they
certainly
cannot
appeal.
that
would
be
the
manner
in
which
it
would
be
done
if
the
state...
if
the
state--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--i
would
say
as
a
matter
of
double
jeopardy,
yes,
there
would
be
a
reason
to
fear
that.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
i'm...
that's--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--well,
your
honor,
i
mean,
i
think
it's
unlikely
that
the
state
would
do
that,
but
i'm
saying
that--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
yes,
your
honor.
justice
breyer,
it's
not
like
a
hung
jury
first
because
in
the
hung
jury
cases,
the
jury
fails
to
reach
a
decision
and,
as
a
result,
the
trial
court
then
discontinues
the
proceedings.
a
hung
jury
does
not
result
in
the
entry
of
a
judgment.
in
a
hung
jury
situation,
the
case
gets
sent
back
and
the
prosecution
then
has
the
opportunity
to
decide
whether
it's
going
to
proceed
with
a
retrial.
this
is
not
a
hung
jury.
it's
not
a
hung
jury
because
1)
it
does
not
produce
a
mistrial,
it
produces
as
a
matter
of
law
an
entry
of
judgment,
and
that
judgment
is
a...
what
we
would
say
is
a...
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
the
reason
it's
a
judgment
of
acquittal
is
because
this
court
has
made
clear
in
the
context
of
bullington,
it's
made
clear
in
the
context
of
rumsey,
and
even
in
monje
v.
california
and
casperri
that
there
is
something
fundamentally
different
about
a
capital
sentencing
proceeding
that
has
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
trial
of
guilt
or
innocence.
there's
something
fundamentally
different
about
those
proceedings
from
any
other
sentencing
proceeding
and,
because
of
that,
because
a
capital
sentencing
proceeding
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
life
or
death,
and
because
the
state
has
additional
burdens
of
proof,
additional
evidentiary
requirements,
the
sentencing
phase
is,
in
effect,
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
greater
offense.
because
of
these
factors,
when
a
defendant
emerges
from
a
capital
sentencing
proceeding,
tried
to
completion,
submitted
to
a
jury
and,
after
the
deliberations
are
done
and
the
law
operates,
comes
out
of
this
with
a
sentence
of
life,
that
life
sentence
is
an
acquittal
of
the
death
penalty.
now,
because
of
that--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
well,
but
your
honor,
i
think
it's
important
to
know
what
it
is
that
the
jury
knew
at
the
time
that
it
made
its
statement
to
the
judge
that
it
was
going
to...
that
it
was
intractably
split
9
to
3
in
favor
of
life.
what
that
jury
knew,
because
it
was
told
in
the
jury
instructions,
was
that
there
were
certain
circumstances
in
which
it
could
impose
a
death
penalty.
there
were
two
limited
circumstances...
aggravating
circumstances
and
no
mitigation,
or
aggravation
that
outweighed
mitigation...
and
in
all
other
circumstances
a
life
sentence
would
be
returned,
so
the
jury
is
told
that
up
front.
then
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
to
take
a
look
at
the
verdict
slip
in
the
case,
and
the
verdict
slip...
which
contained
language
in
bold
capital
letters
that
were
mandated
by
the
pennsylvania
rules
of
criminal
procedure...
the
verdict
slip
also
told
the
story
the
same
things,
and
told
the
jury
that
if
it
could
not
reach
a
unanimous
verdict,
it
was
to
report
that
to
the
court,
and
if
the
court
found
two
facts,
1)
that
they
were
not
unanimous
and
2)
that
they
were
not
going
to
be
unanimous,
the
court
would
have
the
duty
to
impose
a
life
sentence.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
what's
clear
from
this
is
that
this
jury
knew
when
it
was
reporting
back
that
a
life
sentence
would
result,
and
what's
also
clear
is
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
the
legislature
has
determined...
the
legislature
has
placed
on
the
state
the
burden
of
persuading
all
12
jurors
that
death
is
the
appropriate
punishment,
that
aggravation
outweighs
mitigation.
when
the
jury
splits,
that
is
a
fact
finding
that
the
state
has
not
proven
its
case
to
all
12.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
well,
it's
a
fact
finding
by
all
of
the
jurors
that
the
state
has
not
been
able
to
persuade
everybody.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
yes,
your
honor,
but
then
again,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
double
jeopardy...
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law...
there's
nothing
magical
about
the
jury
having
to
be
unanimous.
in
fact--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--but
here
the
sentencer
came
back
and
said
because
the
state
has
failed
to
prove
its
case
for
death,
then
the
answer
is
life.
the
pennsylvania
law
sets
for
the
circumstances
in
which
the
state
has
either
proven
or
failed
to
prove
its
case
for
death,
and--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--essentially,
your
honor,
what
you're
stating
is
the
clean
slate
doctrine,
and
what...
and
i
think
it's
critical,
when
we're
categorizing
the
cases,
to
figure
out
which
box
this
case
goes
in.
the
clean
slate
doctrine
applies
when
the
defendant
has
been
convicted,
and
has
been
convicted
of
the
relevant
charge.
if
it's
true,
as
this
court
has
said
in
bullington,
and
as
this
court
has
said
in
rumsey,
and
i
would
suggest,
your
honors,
as
it
said
in
both
casperri
and
monje,
that
there
is
this
categorical
distinction
between
capital
sentencing
proceedings
and
noncapital
proceedings,
and
that
what
happens
in
a
trial-like
capital
sentencing
proceeding
is
that
you
have
a
separate
trial
on
the
issue
of
the
death
penalty,
then
when
you
are
appealing
from
your
guilt
stage
conviction,
you're
essentially
appealing
from
a
lesser
offense,
and
so,
using
as
the
analogy
green
versus
united
states,
you
would
not
be
appealing...
you
would
not
be
placing
the
sentence
at
issue.
you
have
won
on
the
issue
of
sentence,
so
you're
appealing
a
lesser
offense.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
but
pennsylvania
can't--
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
in
bullington?
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
justice
stevens,
in
bullington
we
can
take
it
one
step
further.
in
bullington,
we
know
that
the
jury
found
at
least
one
aggravating
circumstance.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
now,
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
make
a...
i'd
like
to
just
talk
very
briefly
about
the
second
issue
and
then
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
the
commonwealth
has
agreed
that
this
statute...
the
pennsylvania
statute...
has
created
a
liberty
interest,
a
life
and
liberty
interest
in
the
life
sentence
that
was
the
product
of
the
nonunanimous
jury.
what
we
would
like
to...
the
dispute
between
the
parties
is
whether
that
life
and
liberty
interest
that
the
state
concedes
exists
survives
an
appeal,
and
for
all
the
reasons
that
we've
talked
about
in
the
briefs,
we
would
say
it
does,
because
there
is
a
special
interest
in
finality.
this
court
has
recognized
in
bullington
and
in
rumsey
that
capital
sentencing
proceedings...
and
also
in
the
other,
the
noncapital
cases
we
mentioned...
that
one
of
the
hallmark
differences
between
a
capital
sentencing
phase
and
a
noncapital
sentencing
is
precisely
the
expectation
in
finality
in
the
capital
sentencing,
and
so
the
defendant
has
a
legitimate
and
substantial
expectation
going
in
that
when
he
gets
this
life
sentence,
it
is
going
to
be
a
sentence
that
will
remain
with
him.
we
would
say
that
pennsylvania
arbitrarily
deprives
a
defendant
of
this
life
and
liberty
interest
if
it
conditions
his
appeal...
if
it
conditions
the
enforcement
of
that
right...
upon
giving
up
the
right
to
appeal
a
lesser
and
distinctly
different
offense.
it's
conditioning
the
enforcement
of
his
life
sentence
for...
in
this
case...
upon
his
not
appealing
the
lesser
first
degree
murder
charge,
and
that's
where
we
say
it's
arbitrary.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
b.
dunham
your
honors,
i
would
just
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points
in
rebuttal.
the
first
issue
i'd
like
to
address
is
the
question
of
the
state's
interest
in
closure,
and
the
policies,
the
way
the
double
jeopardy
policies
work
out
in
this
statute
in
this
case.
what
pennsylvania...
pennsylvania's
statute
as
it's
written
recognizes
several
different
interests.
one
of
the
interests
it
recognizes
is
the
interest
in
economy,
the
interests
in
finality,
the
interest
in
giving
the
state
a
single
opportunity
to
try
and
obtain
a
death
penalty.
on
the
other
hand,
it
balances
this
against
what
this
court
has
in
the
past
said
is
a
desirable
goal
of
trying
to
achieve
jury
unanimity.
so
it
has
a
preference
for
a
unanimous
jury,
and
it
balances
that
against
the
finality
of
the
sentence.
and
that's
why
the
judge
is
required,
when
the
jury
comes
back
and
says
that
it
is
not
unanimous,
why
that
judge
is
then
required
to
see
if
further
deliberations
are
going
to
be
fruitful.
when
the
judge
determines
that
the
jury
is
not
unanimous,
and
determines
that
the
jury
is
not
going
to
become
unanimous,
that
represents
a
decision
at
that
point
that
the
interest
in
finality,
imposing
the
life
sentence
now
and
ending
it,
outweighs
the
interest
in
obtaining
a
unanimous
jury.
and
that
is...
and
that
triggers,
that
ties
into
this
court's
long-term
double
jeopardy
jurisprudence
that
one
of
the
primary
interests
is
against
subjecting
a
defendant
to
multiple
trials,
forcing
him
to
run
the
gamut
of
a
second
capital
sentencing
proceeding
after
the
first
has
been
tried
to
completion.
on
another
issues,
your
honors,
one
of
the
things
that
i
would
suggest
as
a
possible
structural
way
of
looking
at
capital
sentencing
cases
to
see
whether
there
is
a
sensible
way
of
determining
whether
or
not
what
you
have
is
an
acquittal
is
this.
in
bullington,
this
court
talked
about
the
binary
choice
between
life
or
death,
and
the
significance
of
that
when
you
have
a
trial-like
proceeding,
in
distinguishing
between
whether
it's
an
acquittal
or
a
conviction,
so
there's
a
binary
choice.
what
the
pennsylvania
statute
has
done
is
create
a
second
binary
choice,
only
it's
a
procedural
one.
if
this
were
a
hung
jury
like
what
you
see
at
trial,
the
jury
has
three
options.
they
can
acquit,
they
can
convict,
or
there's
limbo.
the
hung
jury
in
the
case
goes
back.
the
pennsylvania
legislature
has
determined
that
there
is
a
second
binary
choice...
a
procedural
choice...
and
that
is,
unless
there
is
a
conviction,
a
life
sentence
is
entered,
and
by
eliminating
that
third
category,
it
has
made
the
determination
that
any
failure
by
the
state
to
prove
its
case
to
a
unanimous
jury
constitutes
an
acquittal,
so
i
would
say
that
the
second
binary
choice,
the
procedural
choice,
is
a
bright
line
way
of
saying
whether
or
not
there
is
an
acquittal.
and
a
bright
line,
i
think,
is
what
bullington
and
rumsey
stand
for--
