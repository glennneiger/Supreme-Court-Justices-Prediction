justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
if
you're
looking
at
the
text,
then
just
a
few
lines
above,
in
the
text,
where
it
talks
about
findings,
it
says
that,
due
to
the
nature
of
the
roles
of
men
and
women,
primary
responsibility
for
family
care-taking
often
falls
on
women,
and
then
it
says
employment
standards
that
apply
to
just
one
gender
have
serious
potential
for
encouraging
employers
to
discriminate
against
people
of
that
gender.
so
what
i
take
that
to
mean
is
that,
without
this,
state
employers
as
well
as
others
tend
to
say
to
the
woman,
you
go
take
care
of
your
sick
mother,
and
because
employers
know
that,
they
won't
hire
women.
that's
what
it
says
in
(5)
and
(6),
and
i
would
have
thought
that
sounded
like
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
as
if
this
statute
is
designed
to
help
remove
one
of
the
major
reasons
why
employers
discriminate
against
women.
that's
what
(5)
and
(6)
says,
and
then
the...
10
lines
down
it
says,
pursuant
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
wait,
because
if
you
accept,
i
take
it,
you
accept
the
proposition
that
congress
has
sufficiently
shown,
as
far
as
anyone
need
do,
that
state
employers
discriminated
in
their
hiring
against
women,
the
gener...
you
accept
that,
is
that
right?
that's
your...
your...
your...
your,
for...
because
if
that's
not
so,
i
guess
goodbye
to
title
vii,
a
whole
bunch
of
things,
but
is...
do
you
accept
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
distinguish
title
vii.
i'm
asking
you
if,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
you
accept
the
proposition
that
it
is
adequately
shown
that
state
employers,
like
a
lot
of
other
employers,
did
discriminate
against
women
in
hiring
people,
in
general.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
a
yes
answer
or
a
no
answer,
if
i
could.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
at
the
time
of
this
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
okay.
you
do
not
accept
the
proposition
that
it
is
adequately
shown
that
state
employers
discriminated
against
women
when
they
passed
this
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
no,
then,
i
don't
see
the
distinction
with
title
vii.
it's
goodbye
if
i
accept
that
argument,
i
think.
it's
just
that
it
was
earlier?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
because
if
you
imagined,
and
you
won't
concede
this,
but
i
think,
take
it
as
a
hypothetical,
then,
if
you
imagined
that
state
employers
had
been
shown
to
discriminate
against
women
in
hiring,
wouldn't
congress
have
quite
a
lot
of
leeway
in
choosing
the
remedy
for
that
discrimination,
and
wouldn't
this
statute
be
part
of
the
remedy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
other
words,
if
it's
absolutely,
then
the
answer
as
far
as
you
see
it
in
this
case
is
whether
there
has
been
an
adequate
showing
that
at
the
time
of
this
statute
state
employers
discriminated
against
women
in
hiring,
and
if
the
answer
to
that
question
in
your
view
is,
there
was
an
adequate
showing,
this
is
an
appropriate
remedy,
but
if
the
answer
in
your
view
is,
it
wasn't
an
adequate
showing,
then,
of
course,
you
would
win.
that's
how
you're
basically
seeing
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
the
medical
leave
act
here.
we're
not
talking
about
parenting,
are
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
you're
thinking
under
this
court's
cases,
which
we
accept
as
a
given,
congress
would
have
more
leeway
to
create
a
remedy
for
the
general
discrimination
than
it
might
have
if
the
discrimination,
that
if
the
leave
discrimination
were
at
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
there's
enough
for
both,
but
the
remedial
power
is
greater,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
there's
a
discernible
pattern
of
intentional
and
purposeful
discrimination
when
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
the
states
were
cited
as
being
in
the
forefront
of
enlightened
policies.
