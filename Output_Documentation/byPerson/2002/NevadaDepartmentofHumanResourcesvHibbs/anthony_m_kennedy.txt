suppose
you
have
two
statutes,
one
is
a
congressional
statute
that
says,
all
states
must
have
employment
and
pay
policies
that
do
not
differentiate
on
the
basis
of
gender,
and
the
second
is
the
fmla.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fmla
is
much
more
limited.
it's
just
12
weeks,
the
damages
are
capped,
it's
simple
to
operate--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
would
think
that
that
is
much
more
proportional
and
congruent
than
the
other
statute
that
i
described.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
this
question
about
the
operation
of
this
law
in
light
of
our
recent
cases
on
the
eleventh
amendment.
is
it
your
understanding
that
because
of
the
exercise
of
the
commerce
clause
power,
that
the
states
are
bound
by
this
law--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
all
we're
talking...
and...
and
do
you
think
that
state
attorney
generals
like...
probably
mr.
taggart
would
be
the
better
one
to
ask
that
question...
would
tell
their
governors
and
their
officials
you
are
bound,
by
law,
to
grant
the
family...
to
follow
the
family
medical
leave
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
if
there's
a
big
problem
you
can
have
an
ex
parte
young
suit
or,
if
the
government
just
is...
the
united
states
is
concerned
about
this,
the
government
of
the
united
states
can
intervene,
and
why
isn't
that
wholly
adequate--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
enforce
this
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
holding,
upholding
money
damages
under
the
fmla,
because
i
take
it
you
concede,
or
don't
you,
that
nevada
is
bound
to
follow
this
law?
