but
mr.
taggart,
we--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
first
rule
of
statutory
construction
is
to
read
on,
and
if
you
read
on
with
me--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
will
find
it
said,
to
promote
the
role
of
equal
employment
opportunity
for
women
and
men
pursuant
to
such
clause,
to
promote
the
goal
of
equal
opportunity
for
women
and
men.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
didn't
you
mention
(5)
in
your
opening
brief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
one
would
look
to
the
statute
before
one
looks
to
the
house
or
the
senate
report.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
pursuant
to
such
clause--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
taggart,
i
thought
that
part
of
your
argument
was,
if
the
discrimination
doesn't
exist
anymore
in
the
state,
even
if
it
did
at
one
time,
then
the
provision
would
have
to
sunset,
and
as
far
as
title
vii
is
concerned,
many
states,
the
vast
majority
of
states
have
their
own
title
vii
laws,
so
at
this
point
in
time
i
guess,
under
your
reasoning,
fitzpatrick
and
bitzer
would
have
to
go.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the...
in
the
title
of
title
vii
what
was
the
pattern
and
practice
that
justified
that
result,
because
when
the
original
title
vii
was
passed
this
court
had
never
declared
any
law
that
differentiated
on
the
basis
of
gender
unconstitutional,
and
when
it
was
extended
to
public
employees...
was
it
in
'72
+/?
this
court
had
just
begun
to
address
the
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet
the
court
said
congress
could
do
that
in
'72
with
no
special
record
of
any
kind.
the
record,
to
the
extent
it
existed,
was
made
for
race,
not
sex.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
taggart,
there
have
been
scores
of
title
vii
cases
where
there's
a
nice,
neutral
standard,
and
then
there's
a
decision
maker,
and
the
decision
maker
is
exercising
discretion
under
these
general
standards.
and
time
after
the
time,
the
decision
maker
is
duplicating
himself,
whether
race,
sex,
and
the
people
who
don't
look
like
the
decision
maker
say,
gee,
we
suspect
discrimination.
there
have
been
countless
title
vii
suits
that
have
prevailed
on
that,
that
the
standards
are
nice
and
neutral,
but
the
discretion
whether
to
hire
is
made
by
someone
who
is
coming
up
with
results
that
exclude
these
people.
now,
do
you
think
that
state
employers,
that
the
people
who
do
hiring
and
promotions
for
states
are
so
nonbiased,
so
unprejudiced
that
that
doesn't
affect
the
decision
makers
on
the
state
level,
as
opposed
to
the
municipal
level,
and
in
private
employment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
title
vii,
too,
the
lead
was
taken
by
the
states.
several
states
had
human
rights
laws
long
before
there
was
any
federal
law.
at
least
as
to
those
states
title
vii
should
not
have
been
valid
legislation,
should
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
there
was
no
sign
that
they
were
not
at
least
as
good
as
the
federal
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
kind
of
the
successor
of
the
man
going
down
with
his
babe
in
arms
to
ask
for
an
excuse
from
jury
duty
and
they
said,
would
tell
him
no,
you
don't
get
any
excuse,
but
you
give
excuses
to
women.
yes,
because
women
take
care
of
children.
i
take
care
of
children.
that's
the
same
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
changes
in
the
unemployment
and
workers'
compensation
laws,
those
persisted.
wasn't
the
wengler
decision
in
1980?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
states
all
have
that
kind
of
one-way
law,
where
the
woman
did
not...
if
the
woman
wage
earner
died,
then
her
husband
got
nothing
because
she
was
not
considered
really
an
equal
worker.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
went
on
till
1980.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
scalia
is
right,
is
he
not,
that
it...
the
bill
that
he's
talking
about
was
the
'87
bill,
and
that
didn't
say
anything
about
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
that's
the
startling
difference
between
the
bill
that
actually
passed
in
1993.
