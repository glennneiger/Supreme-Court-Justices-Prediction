thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
family
medical
leave
act
is
an
appropriate
response
to
enduring
problems
of
state
sex
discrimination
bias
against
women
in
hiring
and
promotion
because
employers
assume
that
women
are
more
likely
than
men
to
leave
their
jobs
to
go
take
care
of
their
family
members,
and
bias
against
men
in
the
dispensing
of
family
leave.
congress
gathered
ample
recent
evidence
of
these
mutually
reinforcing
problems,
and
congress
also
built
on
a
known
foundation
of
state
laws
and
decisions
fostering
different
roles
for
men
and
women
in
work
and
family.
those
different
roles
and
beliefs
about
them
persist.
offering
a
threshold
amount
of
leave
to
men
and
women
alike
is
responsive
to
the
problems.
the
act
has
successfully
encouraged
more
men
to
take
the
leave,
and
in
narrowing
the
gap
between
men's
and
women's
leave
rates,
the
act
erodes
the
very
basis
of
employers'
bias
against
women.
if
you
will,
it
makes
men
and
women
equally
unattractive.
[laughter]
the
act
also
responds
to
discrimination
against
men
in
the
dispensing
of
leave.
a
bare
prohibition
against
discrimination
doesn't
do
that
and,
in
fact,
the
bare
prohibition
against
discrimination
in
the
dispensing
of
leave
had
been
in
place.
that's
title
vii,
and
that,
for
the
generation
during
which
title
vii
applied
to
the
states,
that
had
not
succeeded
in
eradicating
sex-based
dispensing
of
leave,
and
in
the
real
world--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--by
the
states.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
highlight
four
aspects
of
the
evidence
of
sex-based
discrimination
in
leave
specifically
about
the
states.
first,
congress
learned
of
the
pattern
of
state
granting
leave
through
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics'
figures.
in
1987,
50
percent
of
women
in
state
and
local
government,
as
compared
to
30
percent
of
men
in
state
and
local
government,
were
offered
parenting
leave.
yale
also
did
a
50-state
survey
to
which--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--the
statute--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--parenting
leave
was
available
to
them
in
their
state--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--whether
they
took
it
or
not.
this
is
not
rates
of
people
taking.
this
is
rates
of
people
who
had
it
available.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
should
they
choose,
yes,
and
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
is
very
clear
on
that.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
the
states'
laws
and
the
states'
policies,
and
this
is
confirmed
by
other
pieces
of
evidence.
yale
did
a
50-state
survey
to
which
36
states
responded,
and
19
of
those
states
themselves
said
they
offered
parenting
leave
to
women
and
not
to
men
under
their
policies.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that's
19
out
of
the
36
responded
that
themselves
admitted
that
they...
they
had
these
policies.
the
president
of
the
labor
union
that
represents
state
employees
said,
the
vast
majority
of
our
contracts
really
cover
maternity
leave.
they're
not--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--justice
scalia,
let
me
clarify,
each
of
these
studies
and
all
the
figures
that
i'm
citing
are
not
talking
about
pregnancy
disability
leave.
we're
talking
about
maternity
leave
over
and
above
pregnancy
disability
leave,
so
we're
talking
about
whether
it's
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
assume
that
women
and
not
men
can
appropriately
go
home
and
take--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--we're
talking
about
both.
part
of
the
medical
leave
provision
allows
parents
to
take
care
of
their
seriously
ill
children
as
well
as
their
spouses
or
parents,
and
congress
saw
these
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
phenomenon.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
yes,
all--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--justice
scalia,
each
of
these
states,
when
they
called
it
maternity
leave,
the
important
distinction
is
that
it
encompassed
but
was
not
restricted
to
a
period
of
pregnancy
disability.
we're
talking
about,
for
example,
in
our
lodging
appendix
at
page
31,
the
rhode
island
agreement
that
applied
from
1992
to
1995.
in
provision
13.7,
maternity
leave
is
available
for
up
to
a
year,
without
regard
to
pregnancy
disability.
another
example
at
page
47,
48
of
our
lodging,
maternity
leaves
not
to
exceed
6
months,
but
may
be
extended,
and
paternity
leaves
are
available
for
3
months,
so
someone...
a
woman
can
take
a
maternity
leave
up
to
a
year
without
a
showing
of
maternity
disability,
and
a
man
can
take
3
months.
and
on
page
40
of
the
lodging,
again
the
pennsylvania
agreement
says
that
women
can
take
a
period
of
6
months,
and
it
may
be
extended
for
6
months,
no
provision
for
a
man
who
is
so
inclined
and
who
wishes
to
do
so,
to
go
take
care
of
his
infant
child,
and
i
think
these
stereotypes
are
very
alive
and
well
today,
and
the
act
was--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--it's
precisely
these
assumptions
that
have
caused
state
employers
and
other
employers
to
discriminate
against
women
in
hiring,
promotion,
and
retention,
and
against
men
in
the
dispensing
of
leave,
and
these
are
really
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
and
the
act
is
working.
in
the
5
years
that
were
studied
from
1995
to
2000,
there
was
a
jump
from
approximately
14
percent
to
21
percent
of
the
percentage
of
male--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--no,
but
i
think
the
point
is
that
there's
an
ongoing
problem,
and
that
congress
was
correct
in
discerning
that
this
was
really
at
the
core
of
the
problem.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
justice
scalia,
congress
already--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--justice
scalia,
that
prohibition
was
already
in
place
from
1972,
and
the
problem
also
is
that
a
bare
prohibition
against
discrimination
cannot
respond
to
discrimination
against
men
in
the
dispensing
of
leave,
because
in
the
real
world
a
facially
neutral
policy
without
a
threshold
leave
entitlement
really
equates
to
a
discretionary
practice
of
dispensing
leave
tainted
by
stereotypes
about
who
should
need
it.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
even
if
employers
do
not
affirmatively
provide
for
any
leave,
they
equally
have
a
no-leave
policy
for
men
and
women
that
is
formally
equal.
in
the
real
world,
some
workers
ask
for
leave
and
some
do
get
family
leave,
but
by
leaving
it
up
to
supervisor
discretion
we
open
the
door--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--to
discrimination.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
many
men
would
be
deterred,
if
they
didn't
have
an
affirmative
right
to
take
the
leave,
by
the
assumption
that
their
employers
would
not
grant
them
leave
if
they
requested
it,
by
the
assumption
that
they
would
be
retaliated
against
in
the
employment
process
if
they
took
it,
because
it
is
still
much
more
unacceptable
for
men
to
take
family
leave
than
for
women.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that's
right.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that's
right,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
so
the
question
is,
why
damages?
once
congress
has
found
a
problem,
a
serious
problem
of
unconstitutional
discrimination,
that
we
assert
exists
here,
the
standard
remedy
to
enforce
rights
in
the
employment
context
is
make
whole
monetary
relief,
the
centerpiece
of
which
is
lost
wages.
title
vii
uses
damages,
the
equal
pay
act
uses
damages,
and
here,
in
the
family
medical
leave
act,
these
are
limited
damages.
congress
took
great
care
to
ensure
that
they
wouldn't
overburden
the
states--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--congress
determined--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--congress
considered
very
carefully
that
damages
were
needed,
and
limited
the
damages.
they're
just
enough
to
spur
enforcement
and
not
burden
employers,
including
the
states.
you
need
money
damages
to
make
sure
cases
get
the
attention
of
higher-ups
in
state
government
as
well
as
in
private
industry.
states
at
the
highest
levels
may
be
fully
responsive,
but
the
application
of
stereotypes
is
typically
at
the
lower
level
of
the
supervisor
with
hiring,
promotion,
and
assignment
discretion,
the
line
supervisor
in
the
state
university,
in
the
state
hospital,
in
the
state
troopers,
in
the
state
human
services
agencies,
like
where
mr.
hibbs
worked,
and
without
the
clear
commitment
by
congress
that
a
threshold
of
family
leave
is
going
to
be
made
available
not
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
not
according
to
supervisor
decisions
about
who
really
needs
the
leave,
but
because
federal
law
requires
it
as
a
remedy
for
past
discrimination.
only
then
will
that
message
really
reach
the
line
supervisors
who
are
making
these
decisions.
so
i
would
emphasize
that
the
act
is
working,
the
damages
are
limited,
and
the
problems
at
which
it
aims
are
clearly
unconstitutional,
and
petitioners
are
just
wrong
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
record.
congress
clearly
identified
the
problems,
the
problems
of
the
states
as
on
a
par
with
problems
of
other
sectors.
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
body
of
recent
judicial
decisions,
finding
state
sex
discrimination
in
employment.
we've
included
some
illustrative
examples
in
our
brief
at
footnote
23.
the
united
states
has
included
some
examples
of
the
most
recent
cases
in
their
brief
at
note
15
and,
as
i
was
discussing
before,
congress
learned
of
the
patterns
of
states
granting
leave
to
women
but
not
to
men,
and
congress
saw
the
family
medical
issue
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
parenting
leave
issue.
these
were
all
responsibilities,
family
care
responsibilities
traditionally
performed
by
wives.
and
so
congress
aimed
in
subsections
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
at
a
common
problem
of
employers'
assumptions
of
women
taking
leave
burdening
their
employment
prospects,
and
employers'
assumptions
that
men
did
not
need
the
leave,
hindering
their
ability
to
take
it,
which
in
turn
exacerbates
the
discrimination
problem
against...
against
women.
so
denial
of
employment
opportunity
to
women
and
of
family
leave
to
men
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
congress
clearly
identified
the
problems,
had
facts
showing
that
they
continued.
nearly
every
state,
until
a
generation
ago,
overtly
placed
discriminatory
restrictions
on
womens'
workforce
participation.
that
history--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--well,
when
congress
was
acting
in
1993,
it
was
only
20
years
since
title
vii
had
been
extended
to
the
states,
and
less
than
that
since
this
court
had
adopted
heightened
scrutiny
of
sex-based
classifications
based
on
the
recognition
that
public
agencies
have
a...
have
a
tendency
to
rely
on
overbroad
sex-based
generalizations,
overbroad
sex-based
classifications,
so
it
was...
it
was
only
since
the
1970's
that
we
started
to
recognize
that
discrimination
that
we
had
previously
seen
as
benign,
as
often
intended
to
help
women,
was
really
hindering
their
advancement,
and
to...
and
to
seek
to
try
to
dismantle
that
system.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that's
right.
we
have
decisions--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--really
her
wages
were
supplemental.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that's
exactly
right,
and
we
have
the
beginning
of
a
process
of
dismantling
this
discrimination.
