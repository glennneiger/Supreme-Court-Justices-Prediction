mr.
taggart,
would
you
comment
on
this
argument,
which
i
think
is
really
an
elaboration
on
the
findings
in
the
purpose
statement
that
justice
breyer
was
referring
to.
i
think
you
can
distill
those
statements
down
to
something
like
this.
we
know
for
a
fact
historically
that,
whenever
burdens
of
family
responsibility
are
allocated,
they
are
allocated
to
the
woman,
not
to
the
man.
if
we
do
not
have
an
employment
standard
that
expressly
says
you
have
got
to
treat
them
exactly
alike,
the
women
will
always
get
the
short
end,
and
that
will
be
reflected
in
hiring
decisions,
among
others.
secondly,
in
order
to
make
this
determination
a
practical
one,
we
can't
simply
leave
it
that
whatever
you
do
for
men
you
should
do
for
women,
or
vice
versa.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
only
way
to
make
this
work.
i
think
that
is
the
argument
that
is
based,
in
effect,
on
these
two
sections.
that
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
simply
an
end
run,
a
phony
commerce
clause
argument.
would
you
comment
on
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
given
the
fact
that
we
have
accepted
in
prior
cases
the
pervasiveness
of
the
phenomenon
that
seems
to
be
quite
clearly
reflected
in
the
findings
and
purpose,
is
that
necessary
here
to
say,
well,
yeah,
it...
we've
already
said,
the
supreme
court
has
already
accepted
its
pervasiveness,
but
we've
got
to
go
a
step
further
and
say,
well,
yeah,
that
pervasiveness
even
goes
to
states.
isn't
there
a
point
at
which
the
point
has
been
made?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
fact
that
title
vii
goes
to
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
in
general,
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
states
have
engaged
in
that
and
were
engaging
in
it
at
the
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
if
they
had
passed
this
statute
without
the
12
weeks
in
it,
and
the
statute
had
simply
said,
on
family
leave
decisions,
the
decisions
have
got
to
be
the
same,
the
standard
for
making
them
has
got
to
be
the
same,
whether
the
employer,
employee
is
a
man
or
a
woman,
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
under
section
(5)?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this...
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
was
trying
to
get
in
another
question
before
justice
scalia
did.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
difference
between
the
case
i
just
put
to
you
and
the
case
that
we've
got
here
is
12
weeks,
and
i
suggested
that
one
reason
for
the
12
weeks
is
a
decision
on
the
part
of
congress
that
if
we
don't
put
some
period
of
time,
some
threshold
period
of
time,
our
nondiscrimination
standard
isn't
going
to
be
worth
anything.
for
example,
just
outside
this
case,
the
states
could
say,
okay,
we're
going
to
give
a
1-week
maternity
leave,
men
or
women.
obviously,
that
isn't
going
to
accomplish
anything.
so
congress
says,
we've
got
to
have
some
kind
of
a
threshold
in
order
to
make
this
requirement
of
neutrality
really
work.
why
is
that
not
a
reasonable
way
to
get
to
the
point
which
i
think
we
both
agree
would
be
a
perfectly
lawful
exercise
of
power
under
section--
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
we'll
take
that
as
a
given.
you
don't
concede
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
it
seem
plausible,
however,
that
the
period
of
time
was
designed
in
view
of
the
pervasive
history
of
discrimination
in
and
out
of
government,
and
that
it
is
just
as
applicable
when
it
is
applied
to
the
government,
just
as
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
however
you
come
out,
as
it
is
when
it's
applied
to
private
industry?
isn't
that
a
fair
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
do...
do
you
want
us
to
say
that
before
the
family
medical
leave
act
was
enacted
there
was
a
discernible
pattern
of
intentional
and
purposeful
discrimination
by
the
states
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
with
reference
to
the
granting
of
leave?
