well,
as
applied
to
private
employers,
i
suppose
congress
had
to
rely
on
commerce
clause
powers,
but
as
applied
to
states,
there
is
specific
reference
in
the
statute,
of
course,
to
section
5...
to
equal
protection.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
throughout
your
opening
brief,
you
never
referred
to
that
statute.
you
told
us
there
was
only
the
(4),
the
one
that
justice
scalia
referred
to,
and
it
wasn't
until
your
reply
brief
that
you
even
acknowledged
that
congress
has
said,
we're
doing
this
to
promote
the
goal
of
equal
opportunity
for
men
and
women.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the...
the
statute
says,
pursuant
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
can't...
what
about
the
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer
decision,
where
the
court
unanimously
found
title
vii
was
a
valid
abrogation
of
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
there
was
no
inquiry
into
the
history
of
gender
discrimination,
it
was
just
accepted?
do
you
think
that
that
case
would
stand
up
under
your
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
this
is
rather
similar.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
our
cases,
is
there
any
difference
between
congress'
prohibiting
something
under
its
section
5
power
and
creating
a
substantive
entitlement
under
that
power?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh,
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
a
12-week
period.
