we've
got
to
put
some
kind
of
a
threshold
there
that
will
mean
something,
and
so
we've
come
up
with
a
particular
period,
a
particular
number
of
weeks.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
presume--
--but
the
real
question
is
whether
it's
directed
at
discriminatory.
at
discriminatory
conduct.
if
it's
private
discrimination,
it's
not
constitutional;
if
it's
state
discrimination,
it
is
a
constitutional
question.
isn't
the
question
whether
it's
directed
at
discriminatory
conduct?
isn't
that
the
basic
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
do
you
concede
it
is
directed
at
discriminatory
conduct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it
were
directed
at
discrimination,
discriminatory
conduct,
that
would
embrace
both
the
states
and
the
private
employers,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that
jurisprudence
came
after
the
statute
was
enacted
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
perhaps
justice
scalia
should
ask
this
question,
but
i
was
just
wondering--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you
have
to
get
to
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
to
get
to
the
1993
version
of
the
statute
to
introduce
the
equal
protection
notion,
and
it's
interesting
to
me
that
precisely
the
same
remedy
was
provided
after
the
equal
protection
became
an
ingredient
of
the
problem
as
was
provided
before
the
equal
protection
rationale
was
introduced.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
12-week
period.
wasn't
that
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
was
the
statute
that
was
repeatedly
vetoed,
as
i
remember
it,
the
bill,
by
president
bush,
and
the
basis
for
the
veto
had
nothing
to
do
with
discrimination,
that
it
really
was
based
on
the
length
of
the
provision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
the
record
shows,
and
you're
up
here
arguing
just
the
opposite.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
latter
was
not
mentioned.
