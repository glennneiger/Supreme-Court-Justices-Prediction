justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
need
the
house
and
senate
report?
i
mean,
the
very
text
of
the
statute
doesn't
say,
in
order
to
assure
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
the
states.
that's
not
what
it
says.
it
says
that
what
we're
doing,
what
we're
requiring,
the
leave
that
we're
requiring,
we
are
requiring
in
a
manner
that,
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause,
minimizes
the
protection,
the
potential
for
employment
discrimination.
i
read
that
as
saying
what
we're
doing
here
is
being
done
with
an
eye
to
being
sure
that
it's
in
conformance
with
the
equal
protection
clause.
that's
quite
different
from
saying
that
we're
doing
it
in
order
to
enforce
the
equal
protection
clause,
which
is
being
violated
by
the
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
statement
in
the
text
goes
to
the
manner,
goes
to
the
manner,
not
to
the
purpose
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
taggart,
i...
i
thought
the
reason
you
didn't
refer
to
the
reference
to
equal
opportunity
for
men
and
women
is
that
that
is
not
a
reference
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
--people...
people...
people...
individuals
could
fail
to
provide
equal...
equal
opportunity
for
men
and
women
without
violating
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
she's
asking
you
to
distinguish
title
vii
from
this.
we
know
you're
not
challenging
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
have
said
it
was...
it
was
general
knowledge.
but
the
statute
we're
construing
here
doesn't
go
to
sex
discrimination
in
general,
it
goes
to
a
very
particular
type
of
sex
discrimination,
and
that
is
in
the
granting
of
leave,
and
on
that,
at
least
i
can't
say
as
a
matter
of
general
knowledge
that
the
states
were
in
violation
of
provisions
of
leave.
i've
no
idea
what
the
state...
what
the
state
was.
certainly
you...
you
need
evidence
to
show
that
they
were
violating
that
particular
aspect
of...
of...
of
equal
protection.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
your...
your
brief...
your
brief
agreed
with
him
zero
percent.
justice
antonin
scalia
your...
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
your
brief,
the
answer
is
quite
clearly
no,
you
don't
think
it's
proportionate
even
if
there
had
been
a
violation
shown.
isn't
that
what
your
brief
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
(5)?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
states
are
covered
by
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
are
covered
by
the
act?
to
how
many
states
does
the
act--
justice
antonin
scalia
--50
of
them.
how
many
private
employers
are
covered
by
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
like
how
many
do
you
think
that
is,
hundreds
of
thousands?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
6
weeks
was
adopted
with
the
50
states
in
mind,
is
the
argument
that's
being
propounded.
it's
clear
that
the
6
weeks
was
designed
for
the
50
states,
never
mind
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
private
employers.
does
that
seem
plausible?
justice
antonin
scalia
insofar
as
the
statute
applied
to
private
employers,
could
it
possibly
have
been
directed
at
unconstitutional
conduct?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
tell
me
what,
before
we
go
on
with
the
discussion,
what
you
mean
by,
were
offered
parenting
leave?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
available,
whether
they
took
it
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
had
the
opportunity
to
take
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
how...
how
could
that
be?
the
states'
laws
were
written
in
such
a
way
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
when
you
say
parenting--
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly,
and
that
explains
the
discrepancy.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out...
what
you're
saying
is
that
some
states
provided
for
maternity
leave,
but
did
not
provide
any
leave
for
the
father,
but
that's
quite
a
different
thing.
i
mean,
does
one
have
to
think
that
parenting
leave,
which
is
the
ability
to
go
home
and
take
care
of
a
child,
is
the
same
as
allowing
a
woman
who's
just
gone
through
childbirth
some
leave
to
recuperate
from
the
childbirth?
i
don't
think
that
proves
anything
at
all.
it
just
proves
that
some
states
had
a
policy
of
maternity
leave,
and
presumably
if,
you
know,
if
one
of
their
male
employees
gave
birth
they'd
give
him
maternity
leave,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
any
state
have
parenting
leave
laws
which
say,
we
just
want
you
to
have
time
to
take
care
of
your
family,
which
applied
only
to
men...
only
to
women
and
not
to
men?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
plenty
of
states
had
maternity
leave.
i
consider
that
a
different
category
entirely.
were
there
any
states
that
had
parenting
leave,
time
to
take
care
of
your
family,
that
applied
only
to
women
and
not
to
men?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why
couldn't
congress
have
solved
that
problem
adequately
by
simply
prescribing
that
no
state
shall
discriminate
in...
in
the...
in
the
giving
of...
of
family
leave?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
maternity
leave,
kind
of
no
state
can
have
maternity
leave
as
a
separate
category,
and
all
family
care
leave
must
be
offered
equally
to
men
and
women.
why...
why
wouldn't
that
have
been
a
proportionate
response
to...
to
the
defect
that
they
had
found?
why...
why
did
the
federal
government,
in
order
to
solve
the
problem,
have
to
impose
upon
the
states
12
weeks,
just
pulled
out
of
the
air,
12
weeks,
this
is
the
solution
to
this
constitutional
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
where...
is
it
supervisor
discretion?
you...
the
supervisor
cannot
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex.
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
without
this
12-week
period,
many
men
just
wouldn't
take
the
leave.
that's
probably
right,
but
then
many
men
wouldn't
necessarily
take
the
12-week
leave
either,
if
it's
available.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
generation
ago.
how
many
years
is
a
generation?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
isn't,
it's
12
weeks.
--entitlement
to
come
back
to
a
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
you
get
12
weeks,
and
if...
if
we
approve
this,
we
are
establishing
the
proposition
that
in
order
to
eliminate,
to
enforce
any
of
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
in
particular
equal
protection,
the
government
may
establish
whatever
substantive
requirements
might
further
equal
protection,
and
i
just
don't
know
where
the
government
plucks
12
weeks
from
and
says
that
it...
we
have
to
stop
discrimination,
and
therefore
everybody's
entitled
to
12
weeks
of
leave,
and
it's
an
extraordinary
leap.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
was
that
the
big
fight
in
the
statute?
is
that
what
was
really
going
on
when
this
12-week...
i
mean,
i...
i
was
around
at
the
time,
and
i
remember
the
big...
the
big
discussion
was
whether
there
ought
to
be
a
federal
law
that
requires
all
employers,
not
states
in
particular,
but
all
employers
to
give
all
workers
12
weeks
of
family
leave
if
they
wanted
it.
that
was
what
all
the
discussion
was.
i
didn't
hear
any
discussion
at
the
time
of
sex
discrimination,
and
you
present
it
to
us
as
though
this
was
the
motivating
factor
of
the
legislation.
i
find
that
hard
to
believe.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
24
weeks
have
been
proportional?
justice
antonin
scalia
6
weeks?
would
6
weeks
be
proportional?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
that
it
shouldn't
turn
on
the
length.
that's
the
point
i
was
getting
to.
i
can't
imagine
that
it
would
turn
on
the
length.
justice
antonin
scalia
--pass
it
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dinh,
would
it
violate
this
statute
for
a
state
to
provide
the
12-week
family
leave
to
men
and
women
both,
but
also
to
continue
a
policy
of
6-week
maternity
leave?
would
that
violate
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
addition
to
the
12
weeks.
justice
antonin
scalia
call
it
pregnancy
disability
leave.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
in
a
name?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
necessity
to
prove
disability,
just,
if
you
have
a
child,
you're
entitled
to
6
weeks
off.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
you
can't
walk,
or
anything
else,
just,
if
you
have
a
child,
you
have
6
weeks
off.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
violate
this
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
is.
it's
maternity.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
solve
the
problem,
unless
your
answer
is
categorically
yes,
it
would
violate
it,
because
then
the
discrepancy,
the
30
percent
versus
80
percent
that
we're
talking
about
would
continue.
