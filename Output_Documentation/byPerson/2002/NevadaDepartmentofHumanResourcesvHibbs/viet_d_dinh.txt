mr.
viet
d.
dinh
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
family
and
medical
leave
act
is
just
one
part
of
a
broader
statutory
scheme
to
eliminate
sex-based
employment
discrimination
in
the
hiring,
retention,
promotion,
and
granting
of
leave
benefits
for
both
men
and
women,
and
that's
the
key
point
to
emphasize
here.
congress
was
acting
not
simply
to
remedy
discrimination
in
leave-granting
policies,
but
more
fundamentally
congress
sought
to
remedy
and
prevent
sex-based
employment
discrimination
based
on
impermissible
presumptions
about
the
role
of
women
in
the
home
and
the
role
of
men
in
the
office.
i--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
i
have
not
seen
a
distinction
in
the
cases,
in
the
section
5
cases
of
this
court.
they
are
few
and
far
between,
as
you
can--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--as
you
can
appreciate,
but
the
distinction
is
not
readily
made.
one
can
characterize
the
entitlement
here
as
simply
a
prohibition
on
discrimination
for
men
and
women
who
take
leave.
it
is
simply
an--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--your
honor,
i
disagree
that
there
is
no
limiting
principle
here,
and
the
limiting
principle
is
precisely
provided
by
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
congruence
and
proportionality.
that's
precisely
the
limiting
principle
as
to
what
is
the
constitutional
violation
that
congress
seeks
to
redress,
and
whether
or
not
the
remedy
is
congruent
and
proportional.
the
constitutional
violation
here
that
congress
seeks
to
redress
or
to
prevent
is
employment-based
discrimination
based
upon
presumptions
about
leave-taking
habits
of
men
and
women.
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
your
honor,
i
was
not
there
at
the
time,
and
i--
[laughter]
but
i
will
take
your
word
for
it,
but
more
importantly,
i
think
we
should
take
congress'
word
on
its
face.
congress
says
at
29
u.s.c.
2601(b)(5)
that
the
purpose
of
the,
one
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is,
quote,
to
promote
the
goal
of
equal
employment
opportunity
for
women
and
men
pursuant
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
the
further
evidence--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--that's
precisely
right,
justice
o'connor...
i
mean,
justice
ginsburg.
justice
scalia
was
talking
about
s.
249,
the
1987
bill.
the
first
time
that
the
section
(5),
the
promotion
goal
that
entered
into
the
statute
was
in
the
next
iteration,
h.r.
925
in
the
house,
in
1987,
and
concurrent
with
the
insertion
of
the
promotion
of
equal
opportunity,
congress
also
included
the
provision
for
family
leave
for
care
of
parent
illnesses,
as
opposed
to
simple...
simply
children
illnesses.
and
so
there
is
some
concurrency
with
respect
to
congress'
reliance
on,
for
the
first
time,
section
(5)
authority
and
the
grant
of
family
leave,
and
that's
consistent
with
the
legislative
record
that
was
before
congress.
congress
was
facing
a
situation
where
it
was
finding
more
two-worker
families
entering
in
the
workforce
and
increased
demand
for
family
care
in
the
workforce,
and
it
said
that,
based
upon
the
evidence,
as
justice
souter
had
summarized,
that
when
push
came
to
shove,
women
would
be
expected
to
take
leave
to
take
care
of
the
family,
and
congress
was
finding
that
push
was,
indeed,
coming
to
shove,
and
was
adopting
a
remedy
that
was
directly
proportional
and
congruent
to
the
period
of
constitutional
violation.
it
adopted
a
gender-neutral
entitlement
to
leave
so
as
to
eliminate
the
underlying
presumption
that
this
court
has
said
is
impermissible.
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
your
honor,
i'd...
that
would
be
a
more
difficult
case.
i
do
not
think
that--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--it
would...
the...
the...
i
do
not
think
that
this
court's
jurisprudence
on
proportionality
has
fine...
is
so
finely
tuned,
and
this
court's
lack
of--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--and
i
do
not
think
that
this
court's
evaluation
of
congressional
enactments
under
section
(5),
the
unique
remedial
powers
of
congress
under
section
(5),
would
turn
on
whether
it's
10
weeks
or
12
weeks
or
13
weeks.
of
course,
if
it
is
more
an
increase,
then
it
would
be
less
proportional,
if
it
is
less,
then
it
would
be
more
proportional.
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
you
mean,
that
same
remedy,
you
mean
number
of
weeks?
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
not
exactly,
your
honor.
h...
the
first
time
that
the
family
leave
was
introduced
and
the
first
time
the
section
(5)
authority
was
invoked
was
in
h.r.
925,
and
there
were
differing
leave
times
for
different
provisions.
i
believe
there
was
one
that
for
section
(d),
for
the
personal
disability,
it
was
24
weeks.
some
was
at
6
weeks.
it
turns
out
that
when
congress
passed
this
statute,
a
prior
version
of
which
was
1990,
1991,
and
this
version
in
1993,
it
pretty
much
reached
the
equilibrium
of
12
weeks.
this
is
the
normal
give-and-take
of
the
legislative
process,
and
nowhere
in
this
court's
jurisprudence--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--no,
your
honor,
you
are
right,
the...
i
have
reviewed
the
veto
statements.
they
concern
the
imposition
that
these
types
of
policies
would
have
on
small
businesses
and
the
economy
of
the
united
states,
rather
than
on
the
discrimination
provisions
at
issue.
but
it's
clear
that
congress,
in
passing
the
statute,
was
relying
on
the
discrimination,
discriminatory
effects
that
these
types
of
leave
policies
would
have
on
women.
and
i
think
the
crux
of
this
case,
if
i
may,
turns
exactly,
justice
o'connor,
on
your
comparison
with
the
evidence
that
was
before
congress
when
it
enacted
title
vii,
when
it
extended
that,
when
it
included
that
into
the
gender.
as
you
may
recall,
this
court
in,
i
believe
in
price
waterhouse
v.
hopkins,
recounted
the
legislative
history
of
how
gender
entered
into
title
vii,
and
it
was
entered
there
as
the
legislative
equivalent
of
the
poison
pill
in
order
to
attempt
to
kill
title
vii,
and
so
not
much
evidence
was
put
into
the
record
regarding
gender
discrimination,
and
yet,
as
you
noted
in
1976,
in
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer,
this
court
assumed
that
that
was
adequate
in
order
to
invoke
section
(5)
authority,
or
justify
section
(5)
authority.
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
there
was
evidence,
with
respect
to
the
granting
of
leave,
of
such
discrimination
in
the
record
before
congress,
yes,
your
honor,
but
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
a
discernible
pattern
of
employment
discrimination
that
this
court
had
taken
judicial
notice
of
and
congress
had
before
it
and,
in
particular,
congress
has
evidence
of
employment
discrimination
based
on
leave-taking
presumptions
that
this
court
has
found
to
be
illegal.
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
it
goes
into
both
the--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--there's
no
question
that
under
the...
under
kimel
the
court
has
said
that
difficult,
intractable
problems
often
require
more
powerful
remedies,
and
that
would
certainly
be
the,
how
the
court
would
evaluate--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--your
honor,
some
states
were
in
the
vanguard,
some
states
were
laggards
in
the
granting
of
leave
policies.
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
yes,
there...
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
i
would
refer
your
honor
to
the
united
states
brief
at
pages
36
to
40,
and
also
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
at
pages
29
through
30,
which
recounts
some
of
this...
some
of
this
evidence.
the
key
here...
but
nevertheless,
the
statement
in
the
record
that
you
noted
was
about
states'
leave
policies,
whether
or
not
they
had
leave
policies
at
all.
we
know
30
states
had...
had
leave
policy.
the
position
of
the
united
states
rests
upon
not
whether
states
had
leave
policy,
but
the
character
of
such
leave
policies.
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
in
addition
to
a
12-week,
your
honor?
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
6
weeks,
if
i
can
characterize
the
6
weeks
not
as
maternity
leave,
but
as
pregnancy
disability
leave--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--well,
this
is
actually
a
matter
of
quite...
quite
good...
quite--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--no,
no,
it
is
a
matter
of
substance,
not
form
alone,
because
pregnancy
disability,
medically
and
in
insurance
terms--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--if
you
are--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--if--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--if
the
grant
of
the
additional
6
weeks
is
on
a
sex-based
basis--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--if
that
is
the
case,
then
that
would...
that
may
very
well
violate
title
vii.
it
would
not
violate
this
particular
statute.
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
yes,
it
may
very
well
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
if
it
is
above
and
beyond
the
pregnancy
disability
leave
that
this
court
has
recognized
can
be
accommodated,
unconstitutionally
though--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--well,
the...
the
key
here,
justice
scalia,
is
that
after
the
period
that
is
recognized
as
pregnancy
disability,
and
therefore
constitutional
under
geduldig,
beyond
that,
parental
leave,
infant
care
leave
is
simply
parental
leave,
and
there's
no
difference
whether
the
mother
or
the
father
takes
care
of
the
child.
indeed,
the
law
would
not
countenance
such
a
difference,
because
that
would
be
relying
on
the
very
presumptions
that
the
law
condemns.
and
so
the
key
here
is
that
if
there
is
an
additional
grant
of
leave
to
either
sex
beyond
the
period
of
pregnancy
disability,
that
would
constitute
a
violation
of
title
vii.
it
would
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
fmla.
the
reason
for
that
is
very
simple.
the
fmla
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
overall
antidiscrimination
scheme.
it
supplements
and
does
not
supplant
title
vii.
it
paints
a
little
bit
more
broad...
more
broadly
than
title
vii
in
the
sense
that
it
grants
affirmative
leave
rights,
but
in
one
further,
in
one
important
respect
it
paints
very
much
more
narrowly,
as
your...
as
your
question
to
my
colleague,
mr.
taggart,
had
indicated,
justice
kennedy.
that
is
because
it
is
very
narrowly
tailored
to
the
particular
problem
that
congress
was
facing,
which
is
the
problem
of
employment
discrimination
based
on
leave-taking
propensities.
and
so
in
that
sense
it
is
perfectly
congruent
to
the
constitutional
problem
that
congress
was
addressing.
congress
could
not
very
well
have
addressed
the
problem
of
gender-based
differentials
and
the
presumptions
in
law
and
in
practice
that
arise
from
those
differentials
by
granting
additional
leave
rights
only
to
women,
or
granting
leave
rights
only
to
men
that
would
perpetuate
the
discrimination
and
the
presumptions,
rather
than
eliminate
it
root
and
branch.
the
key
to
the
money
damages
is
the
same
key
as
it
is
in
our
general
antidiscrimination
statutes.
that
should
not
be
a
surprising...
title
vii
has
the
same
type
of
damage
remedies,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
discrimination,
whether
it
be
for
race
or
for
gender,
is
pervasive
and
pernicious
and
historically
recognized
by
this
court,
and
so
congress
has
made
a
judgment
that
it
needs
as
many
hands
on
deck
as
possible
in
order
to
enforce
the
effort
to
eradicate
discrimination,
and
money
damages
is
part
of
the
normal
remedy
in
order
to
ensure
that
plaintiffs
are
made
whole
and
state
actors
are
deterred
from
acting
unconstitutionally
or,
in
this
case,
in
violation
of
the
section
(5)
legislation
that
is
at
the...
the...
at
issue
here.
the
fact
that...
if
i
may
return
to
the
point
that
the
fact
that
it
should
not
be
surprising
that
this
court
assumed
in
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer
that
the...
that
congress
had
authority
under
section
(5)
to
include
gender
discrimination
in
title
vii,
because
in
the
same
year
was
the
year
that
the
court
for
the
first
time
extended
heightened
scrutiny
in
craig
v.
boren,
so--
mr.
viet
d.
dinh
--thank
you.
