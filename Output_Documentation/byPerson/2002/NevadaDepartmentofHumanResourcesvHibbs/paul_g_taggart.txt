mr.
paul
g.
taggart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
reasons
congress
did
not
validly
abrogate
state
immunity
when
it
adopted
the
family
medical
leave
act's
family
leave
provision.
first,
the
fmla
is
everyday
economic
legislation,
a
national
labor
standard,
not
antidiscrimination
legislation,
second,
congress
was
not
responding
to
a
discernible
pattern
of
unconstitutional
behavior,
and
third,
even
if
such
a
pattern
were
discernible,
the
12-week
family
leave
mandate
enforced
by
abrogating
state
immunity
is
not
a
proportional
and
congruent
response.
the
family
medical
leave
act
is
no
different
than
the
minimum
wage
and
other
national
labor
standards.
it
is,
in
its
operation
and
effect,
it
is
simply
commerce
clause
legislation.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
yes,
they
do,
but
they
do
not...
congress
did
not
invoke
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
it
did
in
the
ada
and
the
adea
statutes.
it
told
us
exactly
why,
in
the
house
and
senate
reports,
it
was
mentioning
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
yes,
there
is
specific
reference
to
equal
protection--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--but
congress
told
us
why
they
mentioned
equal
protection
in
the
house
and
the
senate
report,
where
congress
stated
that
if--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--we
agree
with
that
position,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
well,
why
we
didn't
mention
(5),
i...
i
apologize
if
we
did
not...
if
we
did
not
mention
it,
but
the...
the
senate
report
and
the
house
report
describe
exactly
why
congress
was
talking
about
equal
protection.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
yes,
that
is
correct,
but
the
operation
of
the
statute
clearly
shows
that
it
is
just
everyday
commerce
clause
legislation.
congress
was
deeply
concerned
that
the
family
medical
leave
act
itself
would
be
challenged
on
equal
protection
grounds,
and
that's
why
it
said
it
was
promoting
the
goal
of
equal
employment
opportunity.
everything
else
about
the
statute,
the
way
it
operates,
the
economic
benefit
that
it
provides,
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
prohibit
discrimination
at
all,
show
that
this
is
nothing
different
from
the
minimum
wage,
and
that...
that
is
what...
that
is
what
this...
this
was
adopted
in
the
tradition
of.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
that's
true,
but
the--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well,
it
does
say
that,
but
in
our
view,
it
is
more
important
to
look
at
the
operation
and
the
text
of
the
amendment,
and
how...
how
the...
or
of
the
act,
and
how
the
act
works.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
well,
justice
breyer,
the
statement
here,
in
our
view,
indicates
why
congress
adopted
a
gender-neutral
statute.
if
it
adopted
a
gender-specific
statute,
the
statute
itself
would
have
been
subject
to
challenge
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
our...
our
concern
here
is
that
any
everyday
economic
legislation
that
may
have
a
disparate
benefit
to
one
suspect
classification
or
another
will
all
of
a
sudden
be...
have
the
power
to
abrogate
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
then
state
immunity
will
be
subject
to
abrogation
at...
at
any
expense
where
congress
deems
that
commerce
clause
legislation
is
appropriate.
congress
should
not
be
allowed
to
do
indirectly
what
it's
prohibited
from
doing
directly.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
well,
even
if
that
were
true,
even
if
that
effect
occurred
from
the
statute,
the
failure,
the
utter
failure
of
the
statute
to
satisfy
this
court's
city
of
boerne
test
shows
that
it
is
purely
economic
legislation.
there
were
absolutely
no
findings
by
congress
regarding
state
conduct,
or
whether
state
conduct
was
unconstitutional,
and
it's
difficult
to
discern
from
the
record
before
this
court
or--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well,
first
of
all,
if
that
were
true,
then
any
law
that
congress
passes
that
has
any
arguable
fact
on
discrimination
based
on
gender
would
be
sufficient
for
satisfying
an
abrogation
of
state
immunity.
in
1993--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--yes,
it
would.
there...
or
we
would
take
the
position
that
it
would.
there
is--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well,
there
is
no
requirement,
and
we
are
not
urging
the
court
to
adopt
a
requirement
that
congress
make
findings.
congress
simply
helps
the
court
when
it
makes
findings
about
what
it
is...
whether
there
is
unconstitutional
state
behavior
that
would
justify
a
12-week
family
leave
benefit
that's
abrogated
by
state
sovereign
immunity.
but
title
vii
is
closely
hewed
to
this
court's
section
1
jurisprudence,
and
there's
every
reason
to
believe
that
title
vii
would
stand
up
to
the
city
of
boerne
test.
so
the
difference
with
this
statute
is
that
there
is
absolutely--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well,
we
are
not
arguing
that
position
and,
in
fact,
in
our
view
title
vii
is
so
closely
hewed
to
this
court's
section
(1)
jurisprudence
that
it...
it...
there's
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
satisfy
this
court's
test.
in...
in...
in
this
case,
though,
the
question
is,
in
1993
was
there
a
pattern
and
practice
of
state
behavior
that
would
justify
a
12-week
mandatory
family
leave
benefit
for
all
state
employees
that's...
that's
enforced
through
abrogating
state
immunity,
and
the
standard--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--yes,
that--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well,
we're
not
challenging
title
vii
in
this
case.
we're
challenging
that
in
1993,
when
the--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well,
in
our
view--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well,
in
order
to
show
a
pattern
and
practice
in
1993
it's
this
court's
section
(1)
jurisprudence
on
violations
of
the
equal
protection
clause
that
governs,
and
washington
v.
davis,
incorporated
into
the
gender
cases
through
state
administrators
v.
feeney,
is
a
test
which
requires
purposeful
and
invidious
discrimination.
there's
no
showing
that
there
was
a
pattern
and
practice
of
state
managers
in
1993
of
using
a
gender
stereotype
when
they
granted
leave.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
well,
title
vii,
and
the
circuits
have
said
this
already,
is
that
title
vii
is
so
closely
hewed
to
this
court's
section
(1)--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--if--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well,
a
qualified
yes
if
you're
talking
about
1972,
when--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--not
at
the
time
of
this
statute.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
no,
and
even
if
there
was
a--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--no,
it's
that
title...
it's
unclear
whether
title
vii
even
prohibits
things
that
this
court's
section
(1)
jurisprudence
wouldn't
also
prohibit.
title
vii
basically
codifies
what
this
court
said
in
washington
v.
davis.
it
allows
a
give-and-take
in
the
courtroom
of
the
evidence
to...
to
flesh
out
the
totality
of
facts
that
surround
an
employment
activity,
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
in
the
title
vii
lawsuit
an
inference
can
be
made
of
whether
purposeful
discrimination
actually
occurred.
it
allows
a
defense
not
based
upon
heightened
scrutiny
or
strict
scrutiny.
it
allows
just
a
simple
defense
by
the
employer.
unlike
the
family
medical
leave
act,
which
just
takes
away
any
defense
at
all
for
states
to
defend
the
policies
that
they
have,
that
it
doesn't
even
elevate
state
policies
to
a
heightened
scrutiny
standard,
but
in
1993
state
policies
were
gender
neutral,
and
under
this
court's
section
(1)
jurisprudence
those
policies
should
be
subject
to
a
rational
basis
review.
but
instead,
the
fmla
just
makes
all
of
those
policies
unlawful.
any
policy
that
doesn't
have
12
weeks
of
leave
is
simply
unlawful.
it
doesn't
give
the
state
the
ability
to
come
in
and
prove
that
that
policy
was...
was
applied--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--but--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well,
the...
this
statute,
in
our...
our
position
is
is
not
proportionally
concurrent,
because
first,
there's
no
pattern
of
state
behavior
that
would
justify
a
12-week
leave
benefit.
but
to
completely
make
unlawful
any
act,
any
state
policy
that's
less
than
12
weeks
would
require
a
substantial
showing
that
states
were
engaged
in
discrimination
in
the
employment,
in
employment
practices.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
absolutely.
if
your
hypothetical--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well,
i
don't
want
to
agree
with
you
100
percent,
but...
but
the--
[laughter]
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
well--
[laughter]
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
we
didn't--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well,
the
hypothetical
was,
if
there
was
enough
of
a
showing,
and
i
think
that's
the
question.
we
argue
there
was
no
showing,
which
would
justify
no
remedy,
but
even
if
there
was
a
showing,
the
remedy
has
to
be
proportional,
and
this
12-week
leave
benefit
just
goes
far
out
of
proportion
of
any
discernible
pattern
of
conduct
by
states
which
would
justify
it.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
our
position
is
that
the
presumption
has
to
be
that
states
act
in
a
constitutional
manner,
and
i'm
not
going
to
stand
here
before
the
court
and
say
that
states
are
perfect,
but
there's
certainly
no
pattern
which
would
justify
a
12-week
mandatory
family
leave
benefit
enforced
through
the
abrogation
of
state
immunity.
this...
the
fmla
is
simply
not
based
upon
any...
any
pattern
of
state
conduct.
the
congress
knew
in
1993
that
30
states
had
laws
just
like
the
family
medical
leave
act.
congress
wasn't
thinking
about
whether
states
were
violating
law
and
whether
states
needed
to
be
corrected.
congress
was
trying
to
supplement
what
states
were
already
doing
with
the
leave
benefit.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
well--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well,
title
vii
is,
in
our
view,
a...
a...
clearly,
a
law
that's
clearly
antidiscriminatory.
it
doesn't...
it
isn't...
wasn't
adopted
for
commerce
clause
purposes,
and
in
our
view
in
this...
the
family
medical
leave
act
is
just
a
round
peg
being
forced
into
a
square
hole.
it's
not...
wasn't
adopted
with
the
operation...
with
the
idea
of
acting
like
antidiscrimination
legislation.
it,
in
fact,
would
completely
allow
for
discrimination.
it
would...
and
that
wouldn't
be
prohibited
by
the
law
at
all.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
well,
that--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well,
certainly
that
would
sound
more
like
an
antidiscrimination
law
that
would
require
leave,
if
it's
granted--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--to
be
granted
on
a
gender
neutral
basis--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
well,
first
on
the
latter
part,
a
prohibition
or
a
requirement
for
gender-neutral
leave
would...
for...
if
leave
is
allowed,
it
must
be
allowed
on
a
gender-neutral
basis,
i
would
still
argue
that
that
would
be,
that
would
require
some
predicate
of
a
pattern
of
unconstitutional
behavior,
but--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--okay,
but
on
the
12
weeks
point,
this
court
would
have
to
assume,
without
any
indication
from
congress,
that
that's
why
it
used
12
weeks,
because
that
is
not
why
it
used
12
weeks.
12
weeks--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well,
at
the
time
the
act
was
adopted--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--30
states
had
family
leave
laws.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
every
state
is
covered
by
the
act.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
every
private
employer.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
no,
and
it...
first
it's--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--no,
because
it's
not
so
simple
as
to
draw
the
conclusions
about
the
society
in
general
directly
to
states
and
impute
states
with
unconstitutional
behavior
without
presuming
first
that
states
act
in
a
constitutional
way.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
well,
it's
our
view
that
the
two
questions
can't
be
split,
that...
that
the
state
conduct
is
so
critical
that...
that
it...
the
answer
cannot
be
derived
from
saying
that
if...
if
there's
this
conduct
in
general,
then
12
weeks
fits
both
state
and
non-state
actors.
the...
the
12-week
benefit
was
not
designed
at
all
by
congress
to
target
unconstitutional
conduct.
it
was
designed
to
give
children
12
weeks
of
child
development
time
with
their
parents
when
they're
born.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
it
may
be
possible,
but...
but
any--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--well--
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
--no,
we
do
not
concede
that
it's
directed
at
discriminatory
conduct.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
well,
that...
we
do
not
concede
that
point,
because
congress
did
not
have
any
predicate
on
which
to
base
the
direction
of
this
onto
the
states,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
please.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
first,
it's
important
to
distinguish
that
paternity
leave
and
leave
for
childbirth
and
when
a
child
is
adopted
is
not
the
question
that
was
presented
to
this
court
today.
the
question
presented
to
this
court
is
family
leave,
and
there's
certainly
no
record
of
family
leave
differentials,
as
has
been
argued
with
respect
to
parenting
leave,
and
second,
it
is
not
possible
under
any
jurisprudence
of
this
court
to
simply
presume
that
state
managers
discriminate
based
upon
some
stereotype.
title
vii
doesn't
do
that,
the
equal
protection
clause,
this
court's
section
(1)
jurisprudence
that
interprets
the
equal
protection
clause
doesn't
do
that,
the
heightened
scrutiny
test
does
not
do
that,
it
does
not
allow
someone
to
simply
presume
that
state
managers
are
using
some...
some
outdated
stereotype
in
making
their
decisions.
the
third
point
i
want
to
make
is,
it's
our
position
that
one
who
reads
the
text
and
the
history
of
the
family
and
medical
leave
act
would
hardly
recognize
the
statute
that
has
been
described
here
today.
this
was
simply
every-day
economic
legislation,
and
upholding
the
fmla
would
simply
tear
section
(5)
from
any
remedial
moorings
by
allowing
a
general
legislative
power
of
congress
to
grant
economic
benefits
so
long
as
there
is
some
incidental
benefit
to
some
suspect
class.
mr.
paul
g.
taggart
since...
i
do
concede
that,
and
since
1993
nevada
has
had
a...
a
state
policy
of
giving
our
workers
federal
family
medical
leave.
we
also
have
our
own
state
medical
leave
laws,
so
states
have
joined,
and
have
actually
led
the
federal
government
in
providing
family
leave
for
their
employees,
and
to
simply
say,
and
ignore
that...
that
pattern
and
say
instead
that
states
are
engaged
in
a
pattern
of
discrimination,
or
were
engaged
in
1993
in
a
pattern
of
discrimination,
in
our
view
does
not
stand
up
to
any
of
this
court's
section
(1)
jurisprudence.
thank
you,
your
honor.
