well,
but
now
in
the
statute,
the
findings,
or
the
beginning,
they
refer
to
the
equal...
the
equal
protection
clause.
they
say
it's
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
don't
they?

states?
chief
justice
william

rehnquist
--you
know,
i
presume
to
get
parenting
leave
you
have
to
be
a
parent,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
that...
that
is
a
terribly
instructive
statistic
unless
it...
it's
shown
that
equal
numbers
were
parents,
or
equal
numbers
applied.
chief

01-1368
the
nevada
department
of
human
resources
versus
hibbs.
the
family
and
medical
leave
act
of
1993
or
fmla
entitles
an
eligible
employee
to
take
up
to
twelve
weeks
of
unpaid
leave
annually
for
the
onset
of
a
serious
health
condition
in
the
employee's
spouse.
the
act
also
creates
a
private
right
of
action
to
seek
damages
against
any
employer
that
interferes
with
restrains
or
denies
the
exercise
of
these
rights.
respondent
hibbs
was
formerly
employed
by
petitioner,
the
nevada
department
of
human
resources;
it
terminated
him
when
he
exhausted
his
fmla
leave
and
failed
to
return
to
work.
he
has
sued
in
federal
district
court
in
the
district
of
nevada
seeking
damages
for
these
violations
of
the
act.
the
district
court
awarded
the
department
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
the
claim
was
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
affirm.
congress
may
abrogate
the
states'
eleventh
amendment
immunity
from
suit
in
federal
court
if
it
acts
pursuant
to
a
valid
exercise
of
its
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
congress
would
act
within
it
section
5
authority,
we
hold
when
it
sought
to
abrogate
the
states'
immunity
for
purposes
of
fmla's
family
leave
provision.
in
the
exercise
of
its
section
5
power
of
congress
may
enact
prophylactic
legislation
that
prescribes
facially
constitutional
conduct
in
order
to
prevent
unconstitutional
conduct.
valid
section
5
legislation
must
exhibit
congruence
and
proportionality
between
the
injury
to
be
prevented
in
the
means
adopted
to
that
end.
the
act
aims
to
protect
the
right
to
be
free
from
gender-based
discrimination
in
the
workplace.
when
it
enacted
the
act,
congress
have
before
significant
evidence
of
sex
discrimination
by
the
states
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
leave
benefit.
this
evidence
is
sufficiently
weighty
to
justify
the
enactment
of
the
prophylactic
section
5
legislation,
and
the
act's
family
care
provision
is
congruent
and
proportional
to
the
targeted
violation.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined;
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
kennedy
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia
and
thomas
have
joined.
