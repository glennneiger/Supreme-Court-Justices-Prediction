david
h.
souter
--mr....
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr....
mr.
kneedler,
did
the...
was
the
secretary's
approval
required
on
the
contract
that
included,
or
the...
the
revision
that
included
the
12-and-a-half
percent
royalty
rate?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no.
i...
i
understand.
wasn't
that
also
subject
to
the
general
statutory
requirement
that
these
leases
be
approved
by
the
secretary?
they...
you
know,
it
would
be
negotiated
by
the
tribes,
but
ultimately
didn't
it
require
the
secretary's
approval?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--let...
let
me
just
assume
and...
and
maybe
i
shouldn't
do
this,
but
you
just
briefly
at
least
assume
that
the
secretary's
approval
was
required
as
a...
a
matter
of
statute.
would
that
approval
responsibility...
in
your
judgment...
carry
any
duty
toward
the
tribe,
anything
comparable
to
a
fiduciary
duty
toward
the
tribe
not
to
approve
an
amendment
if
that
amendment
was
not
as
good
as
the...
in
the
secretary's
judgment,
the
tribe
could
have
gotten?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
tell...
let
me
ask
you...
maybe
it
would
be
easier
if
i
asked
you
kind
of
the
converse
question.
what
responsibility
does
the
approval
responsibility
include?
in
other
words,
is
it
merely
ministerial,
or
does
it
imply
any
duty
at
all
toward
the
tribe?
justice
david
h.
souter
nor...
nor
is
there
any
specific
statute,
is
there?
i
mean,
i...
i
think
the...
the
point
that
justice
o'connor
is...
is
raising
is...
is
my
point.
once
you
get
a
specific
statutory
obligation,
assuming
that
approval
carries
some
obligation
of
care,
inquiry,
whatever,
doesn't
that
carry
with
it
some
of
the
duty
that
we
normally
have
in
mind
when
we
talk
about
the
trust
duty,
and
doesn't
that
take
it
out
of
the
sphere
of
the
merely
moral
and
the
merely
political
into
the
legal?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
a
minimum...
a
minimum
is
a
minimum.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there's
still
something
to
argue
about
there,
i
would--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
then
i...
i
think
the
implication
of
your
argument
is
that
the
approval
is
purely
ministerial.
in
other
words,
if
the
tribe
is
the
responsible
party,
then
the
government
is
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that...
that
argument
sort
of
takes
the
lease
terms
simply
in
the
context
of
the...
the
12-and-a-half
percent
minimum
that
the
secretary
had
taken.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
a
stronger
argument
and
it
is
closer
to
the
termite
argument.
and
the
stronger
argument
is
whatever
your
obligations
as
a
trustee
may
be
under
the
approval
responsibility,
you
at
least
have
an
obligation
not
to
skew
the
bargaining
process
in
a
way
that
hurts
us
when
you
know
that
is
what
it
will
do.
and
as
i
understand
the
argument
about
the
ex
parte
communication,
it's
not
that
the
ex
parte
communication
was
per
se
unlawful.
it...
it
clearly
wasn't.
the
argument
is
that
the
ex
parte
communication
resulted
in
action
by
the
secretary
that,
in
effect,
induced
the
tribe
to
take
a
different
negotiating
posture
from
the
one
it
would
have
taken.
and
therefore,
their
argument
is
like
the
termite
argument:
you're
not
supposed
to
introduce
bad
termites
into
the
forest,
and
you're
not
supposed
to
take
action
as
a
minimum
that
hurts
us
as
negotiators.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
makes
trees
less
valuable.
this
makes
coal
less
valuable
under
the
contract.
they
get
hurt.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--can
i
interrupt
you,
sir?
could...
could
you
specify
what
the
variety
is
because
i
want
to
know
the
same
thing
justice
breyer
wants
to
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
but
that's...
that's
a
lease
that
the...
that
the
tribe
at
that
point
had
agreed
to.
would
you
specify
what
the
government
did
or
said,
number
one,
that
led
the
tribe
to
act
differently
from
the
way
it
would
have
acted
otherwise?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
intervention?
precisely
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
you're
saying
the
approval
was
wrong
for
two
reasons,
i
guess.
number
one,
the
rate
approved
was
less
than
half
fair
value.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
okay.
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
stand
corrected.
so
it
was
the...
the
approval
was
wrong
simply
because
the...
the
particular
value
of
this
coal
meant
that
it
was
being
conveyed
away
for...
for
half
what
it
was
worth.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
substance.
and
then
you're
also
making
the
argument
that
it
was
wrong...
and
i
think
i
used
the
word,
the...
the
bargaining
process
was
skewed,
but
you're...
you're
making
that
argument
too?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
may...
may
i
ask
you
this
question
as
to
whether
he
really
did
skew
it?
as
i
understand
what
the
skewing
might
be,
it
would
be
simply
the
refusal
of
the
secretary
to
allow
the
administrative
process
to
go
forward,
as
a
result
of
which
the
tribe
ended
up
negotiating
when
it
might
not
otherwise
have
negotiated.
it
might
have
held
out.
my
question
is
this.
didn't
someone...
and
i
forget
who
it
was
now...
on
behalf
of
the
secretary
come
right
out
and
say
to
the
tribe,
the
secretary
or
the
department
or
the
bureau
thinks
it
would
be
better
if
you
resolved
this
by
negotiating?
and
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
that
is
practically
saying,
look,
we're
not
going
to
decide
this
thing?
you
go
out
and
decide
it
by
negotiating.
and
if
that
is
true,
didn't
they,
in
effect,
tell
them
in
substance
what
they
were
doing?
