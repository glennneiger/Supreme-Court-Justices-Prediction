john
paul

the
court
will
hear
argument
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
against
the
navajo
nation
now.
mr.
kneedler.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
kneedler,
just...
could
i
just
go
back
for
a
second
to
the
secretary's
private
communications
with
the...
the
coal
company?
is
it
your
position
that
did
not
breach
any
fiduciary
obligation
whatsoever?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
not
have
a
fiduciary
obligation
to
the
tribes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
at
least
in
that
respect,
it's
different
from
the
vermont
yankee
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
it...
isn't
it...
maybe
i
misunderstand
the
facts.
but
wasn't
it
fairly
clear
that
had
this
conversation
not
taken
place,
that
the
adjustment
would
have
been
put
into
effect
that
the
tribe
wanted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
was
true,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
letter--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--did
both
the
tribe
and
peabody
understand
what
was
being
considered,
the
increase
that
had
been
recommended
by
the
junior
people
in
the
department?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frye.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt?
mr.
kneedler
said
that
this
really
was
all
contained
in
the
letter
that
was
sent
to
the
secretary
with
copies
to
the
tribe
earlier.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
didn't
you
know
that
at
least...
didn't
you
know
at
least
it
was
a
possibility
as
long
as
the
letter
was
on
the
table?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
frye.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
4
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
