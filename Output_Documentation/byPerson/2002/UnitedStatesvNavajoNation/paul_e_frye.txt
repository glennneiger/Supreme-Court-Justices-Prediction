mr.
paul
e.
frye
in
listening...
mr....
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
listening
to
the
government,
it's
clear
that
the
government
has
not
come
to
terms
yet
with
the
basic
principle
established
in
mitchell
ii,
that
where
congress
gives
the
federal
government
control
of
indian
property,
that
control
necessarily
implicates
trust
duties.
and
violations
of
trust
duties,
when
the
government
is
exercising
responsibilities,
within
the
contours
of
those
statutes
and
regulations,
gives
rise
to
a
claim
for
money
damages
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
that's
what's
missing.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
that's
a
two-part
question.
one,
after
the
navajo
tribe
signed
the
coal
lease
in
1964,
it
had
absolutely
no
control
over
anything.
i'd
like
to
read
you
one...
just
one
regulation,
one
operating
regulation,
that
the
secretary
has.
it
empowers...
and
this
is
at
page
44
of
our
lodging.
this
is
blm's
responsibility,
not
even
bia
who
has
the
principal
responsibility.
blm
has
the
responsibility
to,
quote,
oversee
exploration,
development,
production,
resource
recovery
and
protection,
diligent
development,
continued
operation,
preparation,
handling,
product
verification,
and
abandonment
operations.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
oh,
the
secretary
doesn't
mine
coal
anymore
than
the
bia
cuts
timber,
but
bia
sells
timber
to
private
timber
companies
to
do
the
timber-cutting.
the
bia
oversees
that
timber
production
in
the
same
way
it
oversees
the
coal
operation.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
well,
mitchell
ii
control
is
absolutely
parallel.
the
same--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--yes,
the
second
part
of
your
question.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
imla
has
come
before
this
court
several
times.
in
the
first
case,
in
the
poafpybitty
case
in
1968,
the
government
looked
at
imla
and
said
this
statute
imposes
trust
responsibilities
and
trust
duties
on
the
government.
it
said
that
three
times
in
that
decision.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
it
doesn't
do
so
expressly
just
as
the...
the
timber
statutes
didn't
do
so
expressly
in
mitchell
ii.
but
it
has
that
same
overlay
of
comprehensive
federal
control
and
regulation.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
okay.
we
are
not
complaining,
justice
breyer,
about
any
procedural
problem.
what
we
are
complaining
is...
is
about
the
secretary
colluding
with
peabody
coal
company
to
swindle
the
navajo
nation.
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
i
will
tell
you.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
yes.
the...
the
memorandum
that
secretary
hodel
hand-delivered
to
fritz,
every
word
of
that
was
penned
by
peabody's
lawyers
in...
in
the
administrative
appeal,
and
that's
shown
in
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--that
wasn't
my
entire
answer.
following
that,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
basically
instructed
his
subordinate
to
lie
to
the
navajo
nation
so
it
would
not
know
what
went
on.
the...
and
that
subordinate
was
the
last
person
that
the
navajo
nation
would
have
expected
to
deceive
it.
that
person
had
worked
with
navajo
chairman
peterson
zah
on
the
reservation
and
had
named
his
son
peterson
zah
vollmann.
after
that,
the
negotiations
were
skewed,
as
justice
souter
mentioned.
the
navajo
nation
thought,
because
of
these
odd
communications
coming
from
washington,
that
its
trustee
thought
that
the
20
percent
figure
was
vulnerable
on
the
merits.
we're
talking
about
a
breach
of
trust.
and
the...
the
question
is
whether
the--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--the
record...
the
record
shows
absolutely
no
consideration
by
the
secretary.
the
standard
that
was
at
play
here--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--peabody
actually...
the
letter
that
peabody
wrote
to
secretary
hodel
that
was
mentioned
by
my
brother
kneedler
actually
didn't
get
to
hodel's
office.
the
record
shows
that
that...
that
that
letter
was
routed
directly
to
fritz,
code
200
on
the
document,
and
that
fritz
gave
it
to
his
solicitors
who
were
working
on
his
opinion,
and
those--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--we
have
no
idea
what
was
made.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
that's...
that's
not
the
context
of
this
discussion.
the...
the
royalty
rate
was
upped
to
20
percent
a
year
before.
we
had
had
extensive
briefing,
studies
done
by
the
department
of
the
interior,
all
of
which
said
that
20
percent
was
the
right
number.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
no
basis
for
saying
it
was
the
wrong
number.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
the
number
today--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--is
less
than
the
federal
minimum
of
12-and-a-half
percent.
and
we
proved
that,
and
that's
in
our
proposed
finding
of
fact
number
315
that
it
was--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--we
have
not.
we
didn't
learn
about
this
until
discovery
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
we
have
sued
peabody,
and
there
are
aspects
of
that
that
deal
with
reformation
of
the
lease.
but
we
don't
have
any
ability
to
get
past
damages
from
the
government
for
breach
of
trust
for
the
time
period
for
which
this
activity
was
concealed.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
no...
no
trustee
has
the
ability
to
be
disloyal,
actively
disloyal
to
the...
to
the
beneficiary.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
the
secretary--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--the...
the
secretary
and
any
ordinary
trustee
can
receive
all
the
communications
he
wants.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
if
the
question
is
what
the
secretary
did
in
response
to
that--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--yes.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
the
statutes
and
regulations
did
require
minimum
royalty
rates,
and
as
this
court
held--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--very
low.
absurdly
low.
i
mean,
the...
the
government
would
say
to
this
court
if
we
had
approved...
if
we
had
misled
the
navajo
nation
so
badly
that
it
would
have
taken
11
cents
a
ton,
we
could
approve
the
11
cents
a
ton
because
the
minimum
royalty
rate
was
10
cents
a
ton
even
though
we
knew
it
was
worth
$4
a
ton
in
royalty.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
okay.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
yes.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
yes.
there
are
a
variety
of
things
that
led
the
tribe
to
accept
peabody's
proposed
package
of...
of
lease
concessions
from
our
standpoint,
and
the...
the
breach--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--the
culminating
events
of
the
breach--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--yes.
the
culminating
event
was
the
approval
of
a
lease
for
a
less
than
12-and-a-half
percent
royalty
rate
where
the
tribe
gives
up...
has
a
negative
bonus
of
$89
million
in
back--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--but
for
the
secretary's
intervention,
20
percent
would
have
been
slipped
in
as
the
new
royalty
rate.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
the...
the
memo
that
peabody's
lawyers
wrote
that
secretary
hodel
signed
telling
the
deciding
official
to
stop
action.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
yes.
that...
that
is
the--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--the--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--the
key
modifier
is
if
he
can
get
away
with
it.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
what
the
secretary
had
to
take
into
account
is
provided
by
the
language
of
article
vi
of
the
lease.
the
adjustment
had
to
be
reasonable.
and
to--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--and
to
find
that
out,
the
secretary's--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--the
secretary
can't
doff
his
trust
responsibilities
by
donning
the
mantel
of
an
administrator.
if
it's
reasonable,
that
means
i
think
necessarily
that
the
secretary
can't
set
it
so
high
as
to
bankrupt
the
operation
and
stop
the
coal
mining.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
that
would
be
the
indian
mineral
leasing
act.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
absolutely
not.
he
needs
to
exercise
independent
judgment
to
make
sure
that
whatever
the
royalty
rate
that
he
is
going
to
substitute
for
the
original
one
is
reasonable.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
i
think
fair
is
not
a
bad
characterization.
fair
and
reasonable.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
the
secretary
was
not
doing
what
he
thought
was
fair.
the...
peabody
sent
his
best
friend
in
there
with
his
pocket
full
of
peabody's
money
and...
and
it
was...
and
that's
in
the
records.
it's
$13,000
for
a
couple
of
hours
of
work.
and
he
says,
my
clients
have
learned
that
there
is
a
decision
coming
down
that's
going
to
hurt
them.
put
a
stop
to
it.
and
the
secretary
did.
there
was
no
independent
judgment.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
oh,
there's
no...
absolutely--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--it
was
for
the
lobbyist.
and
frankly,
he
was
underpaid
for
this...
this
bit
of
skullduggery.
[laughter]
mr.
paul
e.
frye
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
the
second
purpose
of
the
statute.
here,
the
department
of
the
interior
thwarted
both
purposes
of
the
statute.
it
thwarted
our
independent
ability
to
have
a...
to
exercise
our
self-determination
in
an
informed
way.
it
disinformed
us
so
that
we
couldn't
exercise
informed
self-determination.
and...
and
that's
what
the
judge
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
said.
he
said,
a
negotiator's
weapon
is
knowledge.
and
unaware
of
these
things,
the
navajo
nation
was
without
critical
knowledge,
and
in
fact,
the
record
shows
that
the
secretary
was
giving
this
knowledge
and
more
to
the
people
who
were
negotiating
against
us.
so
we
didn't
have
that
ability--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--the...
the
request
was...
was
included
in
that
letter,
and...
and
the
tribe
did
get
a
copy
of
that
letter.
but
we
didn't
know
that
the
secretary
had
acted
on
peabody's
request.
in
fact,
the
secretary
told
us
the
opposite.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
i
guess
that...
it
certainly
would
be
a
possibility.
but
there...
there
was
sort
of
a
law
of
the
case
that
developed
in
this
administrative
procedure.
peabody
made
the
same
request
of
secretary
clark,
and
secretary
clark
said
to
his
assistant
secretary
fritz,
what
should
i
do
with
this?
so
fritz
asked
everybody,
do
you
want
me
to
stay
this
so
you
can
negotiate?
the
navajo
nation
said
no.
fritz
then
wrote
everybody
saying,
we've
gotten
your
letter.
you
wanted
us
to
set
aside
this
procedure
so
you
can
negotiate.
not
everyone
wants
to
negotiate.
so
we're
going
to
continue.
that
was
kind
of
the
law
of
the
case
here.
getting
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
the
culminating
event
was
the
approval
of
a
lease
at
sub-12-and-a-half
percent
rates
when
every
federal
study
said
the
royalty
rate
ought
to
be
20
percent.
there
was
no
other
federal
study.
and
that
was
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
care.
this
court
has
said
in
the
kerr-mcgee
case
that
the
basic
purpose
of
the
indian
mineral
leasing
act--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--was
to
maximize
revenues.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
that
is
incorrect,
sir.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
yes.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
volume
ii
of
the
joint
appendix
in
this
court
includes
both
the
original
lease
and
these
coal
lease
amendments,
and
they're
virtually
totally
different
documents.
there's
new
tax
waivers.
there's
a
new
dedication
of
90
million
tons
of
coal.
there's
a...
for
the
north
lease
and
for
the
other
lease
another
180
million
tons
of
coal,
all
without
a
competitive
bid.
so
we
not
only
didn't
get
the
federal
minimum,
we
certainly
didn't
get
20
percent.
we
didn't
get
the
federal
minimum
of
12-and-a-half
percent,
and
we
had
to
pay
a
bonus
to
the
companies
of
$89
million
to
get
what
we
got.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
justice
ginsburg,
we
had
the
tax
before
all
of
this
happened.
and
as...
as
my
brother
kneedler
mentioned
to
the
court,
we
can't
tax
60
percent
of
the
coal
because
it
goes
to
the
navajo
generating
station
which
has
a
tax
waiver
in
the
plant
site
lease.
so
we're
capped
at
the
12-and-a-half
percent
royalty
level
for
60
percent
of
the
coal.
and
before
we
entered
into
these
lease
amendments,
we
were
not
restricted
in
the
amount
of
taxes
that
the
navajo
nation
could
impose.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
i
think
that's
right.
the
damage-causing
activity
finally
was
the
approval
of
these
damaging
lease
amendments.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
yes.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
no.
the
regulation
only
set
a
minimum
royalty,
and
as
this
court--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--the...
in
mitchell
ii,
for
example,
there
was
a
claim...
the
mitchell
ii
claims
did
not
track,
by
the
way,
specific
statutory
and
regulatory
provisions.
there
was
a
claim,
for
example,
that
was
upheld
for
the
failure
of
the
department
of
the
interior
to...
to
develop
a
system
of
roads
and
easements
conducive
to
timber
harvesting.
there
was
no
statute
that
required
that.
there
was
no
regulation
that
required
that.
that
was
part
of
the
trust
duty.
and
there
was
one
other
claim
that
was
upheld
in
mitchell
ii,
and
a
statute
said,
you...
if
you're
going
to
deposit
these
monies
into
the
federal
treasury,
the
federal
government
has
to
get
at
least
4
percent.
it
was
a
minimum
4
percent
rate.
and
the
allottees
and
tribe
in
the
mitchell
case
said,
just
by
turning
around
you
could
have
gotten
8
percent,
and
the
court
below
said,
yes,
you
can't
be
satisfied
as
trustee
with
the
minimum
rate.
you
have
to
at
least
strive
for
the
ceiling.
and
that
was
upheld.
that
claim
was
upheld
here.
so
there
were
several
claims
in
mitchell
ii
that
were
not
tracking
any
specific--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--actually
that's
incorrect.
the
statutory
scheme
in
mitchell
ii,
section
406(a),
said
that
the...
the
indians
could...
or
could
sell
their
timber
with
the
consent
of
the
secretary.
it's
the
exact
same
structure
as
we
have
here.
what
we
have
here
is
the
indians
can
lease
their
coal
with
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
the
approval
has
a
real
history.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
the...
the
secretary
certainly
had
exclusive
control
over
whether
to
approve
this
transaction,
whether
to
allow
the
trust
asset
to
be
sold
or
not.
he
had
exclusive
control
over
that,
and
that
is
within
the
contours
of
the
statutes
and
regulations.
and
i--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--that's
correct.
of
course,
that
lease
itself
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
as
trustee
of
these--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--that's
not
even
at
issue.
there
is...
there
is
no
secretarial
authority
to
adjust
the
rate
in
the
new
lease.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
yes.
i...
i
think
in
response
to
justice
breyer,
the...
the
event
that
caused
the
damages
here
was
the
improvident
approval,
without
observation
of--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--of
the
new
leases.
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
yes.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
now,
the
approval
requirement
has
a
history,
going
back
to
the
first
administration
of
george
washington.
in
the
trade
and
intercourse
acts,
congress
first
erected
what
this
court
has
called
the
strong
shield
of
federal
law,
to
prevent
indians
from
being
despoiled
in
their
property.
and
congress,
when
it
legislates,
legislates
against
this
rich
history,
this
background
in
the
context
of
the
approval
requirement.
in
the
anicker
case
in
1987,
in
a
leasing
context,
the...
the
court
said
that
the...
this
strong
shield
of
federal...
of
federal
law
was
designed
to
protect
the
indians
from
the
designs
of
those
who
would
take
their
property
for
less
than
fair
compensation.
that's
the...
that's
the
meat
of
the
approval--
mr.
paul
e.
frye
--correct.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
no.
this
is
extraordinarily
valuable
coal.
this
is
unusual
coal.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
this
is
12,500
btu
coal.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
yes.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
yes.
the
secretary
should
have
known
that
the
end
result
was
going
to
be
unfair
because
he
had
skewed
the
bargaining.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
well,
the
beneficiary
of
a
trust
shouldn't
have
to
guess
what
his
trustee
is
really
telling
him.
if
that's
what
the
trustee
wanted
to
say,
the
trustee
should
have
said,
i've
met
with
peabody.
i
like
their
lobbyist.
i'm
not
going
to
do
something
that
peabody
doesn't
like,
and...
and
we're
going
to
sit
on
this
thing,
as
his
subordinate
said,
until
hell
freezes
over
until
you
agree
that...
with
something
that
peabody
likes
and
you
can
live
with.
if
we
had
been
given
that
information,
we
would
have
taken
a
much
different
approach.
i
guarantee
you.
now,
i
think
justice
o'connor
made
the
point
that
if
all
we
have...
if...
if
the
trust
duty
only
applies
to
specific
statutory
and
regulatory
violations,
then
it's
meaningless.
the
trust
duty
has
to
be
something
greater
than
that.
and
this
court
in
the
varity
corporation
case
about
6
years
ago
said
precisely
that.
the
trust
duty
has
to
be
something
greater
than
the
sum
of
these
distinct
parts.
mr.
paul
e.
frye
i
would
say
not,
your
honor.
there
has
to
be
this
overlay
of
comprehensive
federal
control
and
supervision.
and
i
would
note
too
in
the
indian
tucker
act,
it
doesn't
restrict
indian
plaintiffs
to
the
same
rights
and
remedies.
it
gives
people...
indian
tribes
and
indian
people
the
same
access
to
the
court,
and
it
uses
a
different
word.
it
uses
the
word
laws
in
the...
in
the
jurisdictional
statute
in
the
indian
tucker
act.
and
we
know
from
illinois
versus
city
of
milwaukee
and
other
cases
that
laws
means
federal
common
law
and
the...
and
if
there's
anything
that's
grounded
in
the
federal
common
law
tradition,
it's
the
trust
duty
owed
to
indian
tribes.
and
that's
what
we
sue
under,
the
indian
tucker
act.
one
month
ago
yesterday,
president
george
bush
once
again
issued
a
presidential
proclamation,
following
those
of
president
reagan
and
president
clinton,
honoring
the
navajos
and
recognizing
their
special
service
to
the
united
states
in
times
of
war.
and
as
this
court
indicated
in
the
shoshone
case,
the
navajo
tribe
was
entitled
to
a
fidelity
at
least
as
constant.
we
respectfully
urge
affirmance.
