well,
the
lease
is
now
expired,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we're
not
still
operating
under
that
same
lease,
or
are
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there's
been
no
application
to
set
aside
the
lease.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
since
the
events,
has
the
tribe
obtained
the
authority
to
impose
taxes
that
was
not
previously--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
is...
does
the
united
states,
though,
have
some
general
duty
of
trust
to
the
tribe?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sure.
and
so
when
the
secretary
has
to
approve
a
lease,
should
that
general
duty
be
kept
in
mind
as
part
of
that
process?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
waive
sovereign
immunity
in
the
statute
for
purposes
of
monetary
damages
against
the
government?
it
doesn't
do
so
expressly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
number
today?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
today.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what...
has
the
tribe
asked
to
set
aside
this
lease?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
know
about
it
now.
i
mean,
does
the
tribe
want
out
from
under
this
lease?
