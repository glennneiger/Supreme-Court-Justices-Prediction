justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
apa
action.
i
mean,
is
this...
is
this
a
proceeding...
was
the
proceeding
supposed
to
be
a
proceeding
required
by
statute
to
be
decided
on
a
record?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
that's
an
informal
adjudication.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ex
parte
communications
take
place
all
the
time
in
those
situations.
so
what's
unfortunate
about
it?
maybe
it
was
unfortunate
politically,
but
i
mean,
legally--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
any...
is
there
any
rule,
regulation,
or
anything
in
the
apa
that
forbids
an
ex
parte
communication--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
this
circumstance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
there
be
now?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
don't
know
any
agency--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
ever
forbids
of
something
like
that,
but
i
might
be
wrong.
i
want
to
find
out
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
violation
of
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
some
d.c.
circuit
cases
that
suggest
when
there's
a
contest
between
a
valuable
privilege,
that
ex
parte
communications
are
not...
not
to
be
permitted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
i
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right.
that's,
i
take
it,
their
argument...
as
i
understand
their
argument,
or
part
of
it
anyway,
is
that
if
you
put...
we
hold
property
in
trust
for
the
tribe.
that
by
itself
doesn't
do
much
for
them.
that's
mitchell
i.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
when
you
get
a
whole
lot
of
very
detailed
rules
and
regulations
about
how
the
government
needs
to
behave,
well,
then,
you
find
that
there
is
a
specific
duty
for
the
government
even
if
it
isn't
quite
in
those
rules
and
regulations
to
behave
like
a
trustee
of
a
trust,
i.e.,
use
prudent
care,
reasonable
care,
whatever
the
standards
are.
so
they're
saying
whatever
the
details
of
the
regs
are
here,
there
certainly
was
a
highly
detailed
set
of
something
that
governed
how
the
government
would
behave
in
this
particular
lease
complexity,
a
very
complicated
situation.
and
therefore,
regardless
of
what
they
said,
there
was
also,
because
of
that
complexity,
an
obligation
for
the
government
to
use
reasonable,
prudent
care
no
matter
what
the
regs
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
what
they
didn't
do
here.
you
see,
it's
just
like
mitchell
ii.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
where
you're
going.
i
see
where
you're
going
with
that.
but
that
reads
mitchell
ii
very
narrowly.
and
it
is
as
if
in
that
forest
filled
with
government
foresters
that
the
tribe
members
had
to
stay
out
of,
one
day
a
forester
working
for
the
government
introduces
some
termites
into
the
trees,
and
lo
and
behold,
there
doesn't
happen
to
be
a
particular
anti-termite
regulation.
i
think
you'd
read
mitchell
ii
as
even
though
there's
no
anti-termite
regulation,
still
there
was
a
duty
of
care
there
for
the
government
not
to
behave
that
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
i
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
these
are
bad
anti-tree
termites.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
if
i
read
mitchell
ii
somewhat
more
broadly
and
thought
that
there
was
an
obligation
there
to
behave
like
a
trustee
even
if
i
couldn't
pin
it
to
a
particular
reg,
this
particular
action,
would
i
then
have
to
decide
against
you
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but...
but
the
government
had
a
good
response
to
my
question,
which
was
that
if,
in
fact,
i
was
agreeing
with
you
for
the
purposes
of
interpreting
mitchell
ii
hypothetically,
they
said,
you
know,
this
is
a
procedure,
and
it's
a
procedure
that
you're
complaining
was
violated.
and
that's
significant
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
would
read
this
trust
responsibility
as
creating
procedures
in
identical
circumstances
where
a
party
is
an
indian
tribe
that
do
not
exist
in
respect
to
anyone
else,
and
secondly,
it
would
be
finding
a...
money
damages,
$600
million
in
fact,
for
a
violation
of
this...
one
of
these
procedural
regulations.
and
i
cannot
even
think...
though
there
may
be
some,
i
cannot
think
of
an
instance
where
a
private
person
who
really
has
been
badly
hurt
can
recover
money
damages
from
the
government
where
what
the
government
did
was
not
follow
the
right
procedure.
so
it's
new
procedures,
plus
the
money
damages,
and
you'd
have
to
overcome
all
those
hurdles.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
that's...
tell
me
a
little
bit
less
pejoratively
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--more
specifically.
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
again,
that's...
you
know,
in
a
particular
context,
that
might
be
terrible,
but
when
you're
talking
about
administration,
it's
a
very
common
thing
for
parties
to
submit
proposed
findings,
et
cetera.
so
i
don't
know
about
this
circumstance,
but
that...
that
in
and
of
itself
is...
is
not
obviously
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but...
i'm
actually
having
exactly
the
same
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
precisely
is
it
that
breached
the
trust,
without
any
characterization?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who
said...
what
is
the
act
that's
supposed
to
be
the
breach
of
the
fiduciary
duty?
it's
not,
you're
saying
now,
the
procedure
of
ex
parte
communication.
it
is...
and
then
you
said
there
was
a
misrepresentation.
what
was
that?
i
mean,
are
there
other
things
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
may
be,
but
there
must
be
a
statute...
there
must
be
a
statute
that
turned
over
to
the
secretary
or
his
office
the
job
of
interpreting
that
word
reasonable
in
the
lease.
what...
what's
that
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
gives
the
secretary...
and
you're
saying
that
that
statute,
when
it
gives
the
secretary
the
power
to
decide
what
is
or
is
not
reasonable
under
the
lease,
means
that
the
secretary
must
really
just
take
the
indians'
point
of
view
into
account?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
fair,
in
other
words,
to
everybody.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then...
well,
but
then
what's
the...
the
breach
here?
he
was
doing
apparently
what
he
thought
was
fair,
i
guess.
i
mean,
maybe
it
was...
maybe
he
was
wrong,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
as
i
understand
it
now,
it's...
what
you're
saying,
it's
just
as
if
the
trees
in
mitchell
where
the
money
from
the
tree
was
supposed
to
go
to
the
indians,
if
the
government
had
cut
it
down
and
sold
it
for
a
half
a
cent
a
tree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
all
this
other
stuff
with
the
procedures
is
just
evidentiary
of
what
was
going
wrong.
but
what
was
going
wrong
is
it's
like
selling
the
trees
at
too
low
a
price,
if
they
were
supposed
to
go
to
the...
the
tribe,
if
the
proceeds
had
been.
that's...
that's
the...
basically
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that...
and
that...
that's...
there
isn't
a...
sort
of
like
a
statute
that
says,
secretary,
give
an
approval
or
not.
what
there
is
is
the
tribe
negotiates
something.
then
they
have
the
director...
the
area
director,
say,
okay,
that's
all
right
because
the
tribe
asked
him
to
say.
and
then
somebody
approve...
appeals
to
the
department
of
the
interior
under
a
regulation
of
the
interior
department
allowing
any
aggrieved
party
to
go
appeal.
and
then
the
secretary
intervenes
in
that,
and
then
they
don't
tell
the
tribe.
and
because
they
don't
tell
the
tribe,
the
tribe
enters
into
a
different
lease.
that's
really
what
happened.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
hard
to
fit
that
into
the
model
of
the
secretary
charging
a
penny
for
a
tree.
the
secretary,
in
a
sense,
didn't
charge
anything
for
anything.
the
secretary
allowed
this
trust
asset
to
be
conveyed
for
what
he
knew
to
be
about
half
of
its
value.
