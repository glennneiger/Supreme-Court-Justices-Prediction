bader

is
there
some
other
possible
cause
of
action?
certainly
it
was
unfortunate,
to
say
the
least,
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
at
the
time
apparently
had
private
conversations
that...
with
representatives
of
peabody
coal
to
try
to
discourage
the
approval
of
the
20-dollar
rate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is
there
any
other
remedy
for
the
tribe
potentially
for
this
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
lawsuit
now
pending--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
apa
suit
that
you're...
you're
envisioning
as
a
potential...
that
doesn't
have
any
dollars
attached
to
it.
that
would
be
for
declaratory
injunction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if...
if
fritz,
the
assistant
secretary,
had
signed
off
on
the
20
percent,
would
there
have
been
a
further...
further
recourse
by--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was...
you
mentioned
in
your
brief
another
route,
appellate
route,
that
could
have
been
taken
in
this
case
which
would
have
rendered
a
final
decision,
one
not
subject
to
the
secretary's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
if
the
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
you
had
started
to
explain
that
the...
the
responsibility,
or
the
authority
came
out
of
the
lease
itself
with
respect
to...
to
the
main
lease--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
we're
talking
about.
but
then
you
said
that
there
was
also
secretary
approval
involved
in
the
one
where
it
wasn't
a
term
of
the
lease.
i
think
you
started
to
say
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frye,
the
government
has
stressed
that
this
is
not
a
control
situation
like
mitchell
ii.
rather,
like
mitchell
i,
one
of
the
objectives
of
this
legislation
of
imla
was
to
give
the
tribe
the
management
and
control
authority,
and
the
government
had
just
a
secondary
role
of
approving
at
the
end
of
the
road.
but
unlike
the...
the
united
states
was
running
the
timber
operation.
here,
it's
the
tribe
that's
negotiating
the
lease.
it
seems
to
me
that's
quite
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
purpose
of
imla
was
to
help
the
indians
exercise
their
own
sovereignty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
got
a
severance
tax
as
part
of
the
package,
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
government
suggested
is
if...
if
you
take
the
12
percent
and
you
add
the
8
percent,
then
you
get
up
to
the
20
percent,
which
was
your
figure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
certainly
not
how...
how
the
court
described
it
in
mitchell
ii
because
the
court
spoke
about
exclusive
control,
that
the
united
states
did
all
the
negotiating,
that...
and
it
made
all
the
arrangements.
now,
whatever
you...
you
say,
you
have
to
deal
with
what
is
in
that
opinion,
and
it
does
stress
the
exclusive
control
of
the
united
states
and
distinguishes
the
prior
case
on
the
ground
that
the
other
case
was
designed
to
give
the
indians
autonomy
to
deal
for
themselves.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the...
the
authority
came
from
the
lease
from
the
term
that
the...
that
the
tribe
agreed
to,
that
the...
the
authority
to
adjust
the
royalty
in
this
case
comes
from
the
lease,
not
from
any
statute
or
regulation.
isn't
that
true?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
second
case
is
united
states
againts
navajo
nation
number
01-1375.
the
indian
mineral
leasing
act
of
1938
which
i
will
call
it
imla
allows
indian
tribes
to
negotiate
leases
to
mine
coal
on
indian
land
and
assigns
an
approval
role
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
this
case
concerns
a
1964
coal
lease
between
the
navajo
nation
and
predecessor
of
the
peabody
coal
company
and
specifically
a
1987
amendment
raising
the
royalty
under
that
lease.
the
navajo
nation
sought
compensation
from
the
united
states
for
an
alleged
breach
of
trust
in
connection
with
the
secretary’s
approval
of
the
1987
rate
increase.
because
no
liability
imposing
provisions
of
the
imla
or
its
implementing
regulations
supports
such
a
claim
we
reject
the
tribe's
suit.
the
lease
in
question
as
drawn
in
1964,
provided
for
a
royalty
of
37.5
cents
per
ton
of
coal
extracted
and
authorized
the
secretary
to
adjust
that
rate
on
the
20-year
anniversary
of
the
lease.
the
37.5
cents
per
ton
rate
was
higher
than
the
10
cents
per
ton
minimum
set
by
then
applicable
in
the
regulation,
but
by
the
1980’s,
the
1964
lease
rates
had
fallen
well
below
to
12½%
of
gross
proceeds
rate
prevailing
for
coal
mined
on
federal
lands.
when
attempts
by
the
tribe
and
peabody
to
re-negotiate,
the
lease
bogged
down,
the
tribe
asked
the
secretary
to
ajust
the
royalty.
in
june
1984,
the
area
director
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
sent
peabody
and
the
tribe
an
opinion
letter
raising
the
rate
to
20%
of
gross
proceeds.
peabody
thought
that
rate
exorbitant
and
pursued
an
administrative
appeal.
peabody
also
wrote
to
the
secretary
with
a
copy
to
the
tribe
asking
him
either
to
postpone
decision
on
the
appeal
or
to
rule
in
peabody's
favor.
further,
and
off
the
public
record,
peabody
representatives
met
privately
with
the
secretary.
in
july
1985,
the
secretary
instructed
a
subordinates
to
tell
peabody
and
the
tribe
that
no
decision
was
imminent
and
to
encourage
those
parties
to
resolve
their
differences
without
government
intervention.
some
months
later
the
tribe
and
peabody
agreed
to
an
amended
royalty
of
12½%
of
gross
proceeds.
in
december
1987,
the
navajo
tribal
council
approved
the
amended
lease
and
the
secretary
did
so
too
shortly
thereafter.
several
years
later,
in
1993,
the
tribe
sued
the
united
states
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
under
the
indian
tucker
act,
an
act
that
waives
the
government's
sovereign
immunity
from
a
suit
by
the
tribe
for
money
damages.
by
approving
the
lease
amendment,
the
tribe
maintained
the
secretary
effectively
deprived
the
tribe
of
the
20%
royalty
it
would
have
received
had
the
1985
adjustment
process
ran
its
course
without
secretarial
involvement.
the
court
of
federal
claims
found
that
the
secretary
in
meeting
privately
with
peabody
officers
had
acted
in
a
manner
elaborately
at
odds
with
the
government's
general
trust
relationship
to
the
tribe.
nevertheless,
the
court
held
that
the
tribe
could
not
prevail
for
no
law
or
regulation
authorized
compensations
from
the
federal
treasury
for
the
secretary's
alleged
breach
of
trust.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
reversed
that
determination,
the
measure
of
control
the
secretary
exercised
of
a
coal
leasing
on
indian
lands
that
court
house
sufficed
to
warrant
a
money
judgment
for
the
tribe.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
our
decision
is
controlled
by
a
pair
of
early
1980
cases
both
titled
unites
states
v.
mitchell.
the
mitchell
cases
instruct
that
to
come
within
the
indian
tucker
act's
waiver
of
the
government's
immunity
from
a
money
damages
suit,
the
complaining
tribe
must
identify
a
substantive
source
of
law
that
prescribes
specific
duties
and
then
show
that
the
government
had
failed
faithfully
to
perform
those
duties.
if
that
threshold
is
passed,
courts
must
next
determine
whether
the
specific
duty
imposing
law
can
fairly
be
interpreted
to
mandate
compensations
for
the
tribe.
the
general
trust
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
an
indian
tribe,
our
precedent
holds,
does
not
in
itself
support
relief
under
the
indian
tucker
act,
instead,
any
toll
on
the
us
treasury
must
be
rooted
in
specific
rights
creating
or
duty-imposing
statutory
or
regulatory
prescriptions.
here
as
the
court
of
federal
claims
reluctantly
held,
the
tribe
did
not
and
could
not
ground
its
claim
againts
the
government
in
any
concrete
statury
or
regulatory
imposition.
the
imla
assigns
to
the
secretary
only
a
modest
part
in
coal
leasing,
it
gives
him
no
comprehensive
managerial
role.
furthermore,
at
the
times
relevant
here,
neither
the
imla
nor
its
implementing
regulations
expressly
directed
the
secretary
to
pursue
the
best
interest
of
the
tribe
over
those
of
the
coal
leasee.
a
prime
aim
of
the
imla
was
to
enhance
tribal
self
determination
by
giving
the
tribe
not
the
government
the
lead
role
in
negotiating
mining
leases
with
third
parties,
while
the
act
reserves
a
lease
approval
function
for
the
secretary,
nothing
in
the
statute's
text
or
regulations
describes
a
duty
to
ensure
a
particular
rate
of
return
above
the
bare
minimum
and
we
reiterate
the
rate
ultimately
negotiated
between
the
tribe
an
peabody
far
exceeded
the
regulatory
minimum.
it
was
on
a
par
with
the
rate
the
united
states
itself
recieves
from
its
own
leases
to
mine
coal
on
federal
lands.
the
tribe's
complaints
about
the
skewing
effect
of
the
secretary's
1985
intervention
into
the
lease
ajustment
process,
that
complaint
is
similarly
unavailing,
would
no
formal
adjudication
ongoing,
nothing
in
the
imla
or
its
regulations
proscribe
the
secretary
from
communicating
ex
parte
with
peabody
or
with
the
tribe.
in
sum,
however,
one
might
appraise
the
secretary's
actions,
we
are
bound
by
dispositive
precedent,
no
relevant
statute
or
regulation
allows
us
to
conclude
that
the
secretary's
conduct
violated
an
obligation
enforceable
againts
the
united
states
in
an
action
for
damages
under
the
indian
tucker
act.
the
judgment
of
the
federal
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
acordingly
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
souter
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justices
stevens
and
o'connor.
