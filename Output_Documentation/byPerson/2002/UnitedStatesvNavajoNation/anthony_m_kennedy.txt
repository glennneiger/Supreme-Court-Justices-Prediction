what
i
can't
quite
understand
with
reference
to
your
position
as
to
the
correct
reading
of
mitchell
ii
is
this:
it
seems
to
me
you
say
that
even
if
there's
a
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty,
there
still
has
to
be
some
specific
statute
or
regulation
which
we
violate,
and
that
specific
statute
or
regulation
must
imply
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
for
damages.
that
makes
the
fiduciary
component
quite
irrelevant.
either
there's
a
specific
statute,
or
there
isn't.

so...
so
the
mere
designation
of
a
trustee
in
these
cases
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity?
