the
d.c.
circuit
used
to
create
its
own
apa
before...
before--
justice
antonin
scalia
--before
vermont
yankee.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
but
suppose
the
government
has
a
general
moral
and
political
duty
to
the
entire
citizenry
not
to
lease
government
land
at...
at
bandit
rates
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that...
but
that
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
doesn't
give
rise
to
a
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
--termites
are
good
for
trees.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
they're...
they're
not
good
for
houses,
but
they're
good
for
trees.
justice
antonin
scalia
oversee.
what
does
oversee
mean?
did
it
do
that
or
oversee
it?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
sure
that
that's
anything
more
specific
than
the
general
trust
responsibility
that
the
united
states
has.
it
has
to
oversee
the
disposition
of
all
the
lands
that
it
holds
in
trust,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
kind
of
control
that...
that
we
were
talking
about
in
mitchell
ii.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
he
did
think
it
was
vulnerable
on
the
merits.
i
mean,
couldn't
the
secretary
think
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
isn't...
isn't
that...
isn't
that
was...
isn't
that
the
representation
that
peabody
made
to
the
secretary,
that
that
was
just
an
enormous
increase
in
the...
in
the
fee?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
understand
that.
but...
but
don't
you
think
in
the
ex
parte...
the...
the
oral
ex
parte
contact,
the
same
point
was
made?
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
what
do
you
guess
they
made?
i
mean,
why
wouldn't
they
have
made
the
same
point
that
was
in
their
letter?
my
goodness,
all
of
a
sudden,
you're...
you're
upping
our...
our
cost
20
times?
i
mean,
you
know,
that's
incredible.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
what
the
breach
of
trust
consists
of.
number
one,
it...
you...
you
acknowledge
it
doesn't
consist
in
the...
in
the
ex
parte
contract.
i...
contact.
i
assume
that
any
trustee
does...
does
not
have
an
obligation
to
call
in
the...
the
cestui
que
trust
whenever...
whenever
a
lessee
wants
to
talk
about
something.
i'm
sure
many
trustees
deal
ex
parte.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not...
i'm
not
talking
about
actively...
i'm
just
talking
about
the
ex
parte...
receiving
ex
parte
presentations--
justice
antonin
scalia
--from
somebody
who
wants...
who
wants
a
lease
altered.
can...
can
an
ordinary
trustee
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
absolutely.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
and
so...
so
then
you...
you're
down
to
what
the
secretary
did
in
response.
that
depends
on
what
the
secretary's
obligation
is,
i...
i
presume.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
as
i
read
the
statute
and
regulations,
the
secretary's
only
obligation
was
to
assure
that
a
very
low
minimum
was...
was
complied
with.
and
after
that,
the
negotiation
was
up
to
the
tribe.
is
that
a
fair
representation
of...
of
what
the
statute
and
regs
require?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
are
very
low.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now
wait
a
minute.
when...
when
the
secretary
exercises
his
authority
to
approve
leases,
is
it
your...
is
it
your
contention
that
the
only
obligation...
not
to
approve
leases,
but
to...
but
to...
to
give
effect
to
that
provision
of
the
lease
which
allows
him
to
increase
the
lease
rates...
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here.
when
he...
when
he
approaches
that
obligation,
is
it
your
contention
that
his
only
duty
is
to
the
tribe?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
should
raise
it...
he
should
raise
it
5,000
percent
if
he
can
get
away
with
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
surely--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
just
don't
read
it
that
way.
it
seems
to
me
that
no...
anybody
would
be
crazy
to
enter
into
a
lease
like
that.
one
would
expect
that
the...
that
the
secretary
would
act
fairly.
sure,
take
into
account
what's
fair
for
the
tribe,
but
also
what's
fair
for
the
coal
company
that
entered
into
a
lease
at
a
much
lower
rate
earlier
at
arm's
length.
you
think
he...
you
think
the
secretary
couldn't
take
into
account
what's
fair
for
the
coal
company
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
reasonable
doesn't
mean
whatever
will
give
the
tribe
the
most
money.
it
also
certainly
includes
what...
what's
fair
for
the...
for
the
person
who...
on
the
other
side
of
the
lease
who...
who
is
suddenly
getting
socked
with
a
20-fold
increase.
i
don't
think
that's
unreasonable
at
all
for
the
secretary
to
take
that
into
account.
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
$13,000
didn't
go
to
the
secretary,
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was...
that
was
for
the
lobbyist.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't...
it...
more
precisely
it
wasn't
the
approval
of
a
lease.
it
was
the
approval
of...
of
the...
the
raise
of
the
figure
that
was
contained
in
a
lease
that
had
already
been
concluded.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
incorrect?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
price
above
the
minimum
that
the
secretary's
regulations
provided
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
problem
then
was
with
the
secretary's
regulation,
not
with
what
went
on
here.
that
regulation
was
invalid
as
arbitrary,
capricious--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that's...
but
that's
the
point,
i
mean,
in
order
to
leave
full
negotiating
authority
to
the
tribe.
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
minimum
is
so
low
that
it...
it
produces,
you
know,
highway
robbery.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
problem
is...
is
with
the
regulation
and
maybe
you
can
get
at
it
when
the
regulation
is
applied
this
way.
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
not
in
mitchell
ii
a
statute
that...
that
sought
to
place
the
negotiating
power
in
the
hands
of
the
indians
rather
than
in
the
hands
of
the
government.
i
mean,
that's
what
distinguishes
this
case.
you
have
here
a
scheme
that
is
meant
to...
meant
to
place
the
tribe
in...
in
charge
of
its
own
fate,
and...
and
it
effectively
tells
the
secretary,
we
don't
want
you
to
negotiate
these
leases.
that's
quite
a
bit
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
i
thought
you
said
some
of
these
were
new
leases.
i
mean,
that's
what
confuses
me.
when
i
was
making
that
point
earlier,
you
said
no,
some
of
them
were
new
leases.
now,
the
authority
to
adjust
the
rate
for
the
new
leases
certainly
didn't
exist
in
the
old
lease,
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that...
that's
right.
so
some
of
your
complaint
does
not
rest
upon
the
provision
in
the
original
lease
that
gives
the
secretary
the
power
to
adjust
the
rate.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
new
leases.
