mr.
arthur
a.
busch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
gang-related
murder
in
which
a
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
there
was
one
trial
conducted,
and
the
defendant
was
sentenced
to
life
in
prison.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
erred
in
its
conclusion
that
the
michigan
supreme
court's
decision
on
double
jeopardy
was
unreasonable.
the
aedpa
precludes
habeas
corpus
relief
where
a
state
court
makes
reasonable
factual
determinations.
the
michigan
supreme
court's
decision
was
not
only
reasonable,
but
also
correct.
the
michigan
supreme
court's
decision
was
correct
for
three
reasons.
first,
this
was
a
factual
matter
which
was
reasonably
decided.
second,
the
trial
judge's--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
evaluating
what
exactly
this
trial
judge
said.
it
was
ambiguous.
and
in
trying
to
determine
what
he
said,
then
we
could
understand,
or
they
could
understand
what
he
had
done
and
what
legal
import
that
had.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
your
honor,
the
factual
question
in
terms
of
what
it
was
that
he
said
is...
is
different
than
what
he
had
actually
done.
and
therein
lying...
understanding
what
this
judge
had
done
or
said,
the
meaning
of
it,
then
would
give
us
some
understanding
of
what
the
legal
import
was.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
that...
it
would
be
our
position
that
it
is
a
factual
question
and
courts...
the
court
in
parker
versus
dugger
and
wainwright
versus
goode
have
dealt
with
this
issue.
where
we
have
ambiguous
rulings
of
a
trial
judge,
that
has
been
found
to
be
a
factual--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--well--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--the
michigan
court
found
that
this
trial
judge's
decision
was,
in
fact,
tentative.
and
that
decision
and
conclusion
was
reasonable.
the
judge,
at
page
12
of
the
joint
exhibit,
speaks
of...
and
if
i
could
turn
to
that
page.
the
judge
starts
out
by
saying,
well,
my
impression
is
at
this
time--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--page
12
of
the--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--at
the
bottom
of
page
12
of
the
joint...
the
joint
appendix.
excuse
me.
the
court
says,
nothing?
well,
impression
at
this
time
is
that
there's
not
been
shown.
and
then
at
page
18
of
the
same
exhibit,
the
court
actually
schedules
an
8:30
motion
the
following
day
when
the
prosecutor
in
this
case...
the
assistant
prosecutor
asked
the
court
if
he
could
be
heard.
and
the
judge
said,
i'll
be
glad
to
hear
you.
and
in
fact,
the
court
had
originally
scheduled
the
attorneys
to
be
there
at
10:00
and
then
changed
the
time
for
them
to
show
up
before
the
jury
came
back.
and
lastly
i
think
it
shows
that
no
one
who
was
involved
in
this
case
at
the
trial
level
actually
believed
that
a
final
ruling
had
been
made.
the
court
says
at
page
34...
excuse
me.
the
defense
counsel
says...
and
i'm
quoting
mr.
odette...
that's
correct.
they
don't...
i'm
not
disputing
that,
but
it's
my
firm
impression
that
when
i
left
the
court
yesterday,
that
there
had
been
a
ruling
and
that
mr.
stamos
had
indicated
he'd
like
to
have
the
matter
reconsidered.
and
i
believe
the
court
said,
whatever.
and
what's
instructive
is
what
the
judge
said
next.
that's
right.
and
i...
well,
i
said,
yes,
i'd
be
glad
to
listen,
or
words
to
that
effect.
lastly--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--there
was
a
docket
entry
which
was
made
by
a
clerk
which
was
not
reviewed
by...
and
which
is
not
reviewed
by
the
trial
judge.
and
in
michigan,
the
docket
entry
isn't
dispositive
of
whether
or
not
the
judge
had
made
a
final
ruling
of
acquittal
or
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
the
court
has
also...
and
without
conceding
my
case,
in
the
alternative,
if
this
court
was
to
conclude
that
this
judge
had,
in
fact,
issued
or
made
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
it
would
be
the
people's
position
or
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
trial
court
need
not
be
able
to
reconsider
to
reach
a
just
result
because
they...
they
rule
so
swiftly.
in
other
words,
the
michigan
court
was
correct
because
judges,
trial
judges
in
particular,
need
time
to
reflect.
they're
often
making
these
decisions
without
trial
transcripts,
in
many
cases
without
extensive
legal
research.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
exactly.
and
also,
this
court
has
held
and
the
statute
requires
that
that
finding
of
fact
be
presumed
to
be
correct.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
yes,
and
in
fact,
in
this
particular
case,
the
judge
did
not
come
to
a
conclusion
as
to...
did
not
enter
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
in
this
particular
matter,
the
court
held...
in
that
particular
circumstance,
it
said
in
the
opinion
that
it
was
harmless
error
in
their
opinion.
however--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--they--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--the
rule
of
the
michigan
courts...
that
is,
the
michigan
rules
of
criminal
procedure
at
6.419,
i
believe
it
is...
requires
that
there
be
some
plain
statement
made,
essentially,
that
there
be
something
clear.
and
that
was...
and
it
is...
our
position
that
the
court--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--yes.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
at
these
of
the
prosecutor's
proof.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
it...
it
applies
when
the
motion
is
made
is
my
understanding.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
no.
it
can
be
made
at
any
time
and...
and
any
point
in--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--that
is,
the
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
the--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--the
rule
is
6.419(d),
and
it's
cited
at
page
17
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
it
says...
about
in
the
middle
of
the
page
in...
in
bold,
it
says,
did
not
substantially
comply
with
the
requirements
of
mcr
6.419(d),
and
provide
that,
quote,
the
court
must
state
orally
on
the
record
or
in
a
written
ruling
made
a...
a
part
of
the
record
its
reasons
for
granting
or
denying
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
and
my
understanding
of
that
is...
that
rule
is
that
anytime
the
motion
is
made,
the
judge
is
supposed
to
make
clear
the
reasons
why
he's
granting
a
directed
verdict.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
yes.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
that's
correct,
once
the
evidence
is
presented.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
the
rights
of
the
judge
to
change
his
mind...
our...
our
position
is,
is
that
he
has
that
right
until
the
jury
would
be
discharged.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
yes,
that--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--yes,
that's
the
rule.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
that's
my...
i
don't
think
it's
specific,
but
i
think
the--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--chief
justice--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--excuse
me.
at
the
close
of
the
prosecutor's
proofs,
that
motion
would
be
appropriate
under
our
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
the
rule
is
quoted
at
page
29a,
note
1
of
the--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--of
our
brief.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
excuse
me.
of
the
joint
appendix.
petition's
appendix--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--petitioner's
appendix.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
your
honor,
i--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--the...
the
rule
means
that
he
should
decide
as
promptly
as
he
can
is
the
way
i
understand--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--yes.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
yes,
and
i
think
that
happened
in
this
case.
this
defendant
came
prepared
to
try
the
case
on
a
first
degree
murder
theory,
and
nothing
substantially
changed
that
and
he
was
not
prejudiced
in
any
way.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
may...
can...
can
i--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--our...
no.
our
position
would
be
that
he
can
change
his
mind
anytime
up
until
that
jury
is
discharged.
chief...
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
respondent
here
has
stated
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
agrees
with
his
position
with
respect
to
the
second
prong
of
aedpa.
in
fact,
the
michigan
supreme
court
stated
in
its
opinion
at
footnote
4...
it
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
it
was
actually
not
reaching
the
conclusion.
it
wasn't
reaching
a
decision
as
to
whether
the
judge
could
change
his
mind.
the
respondent's
position
essentially
requires
the
people
to
forfeit
the
second
prong
of
aedpa.
even
if
the
court
was
wrong
on
its
factual
finding
or
unreasonable,
the
result
of
this
case
must
be
viewed
within
the
filter
of
that
statute
which
says
that
the
law
that
they
applied
was
reasonable.
there
are...
he
has
cited
several
cases
and
we
have
several
cases
in
the
other
direction,
interestingly
enough,
including
one,
united
states
versus
baggett,
which
comes
out
of
the
sixth
circuit
itself,
which
says...
in
that
case
there
were...
three
times
the
judge
announced
a
ruling
and
then
agreed
to
hold
it
in
abeyance.
in...
in
that
case
the
court
said
that...
that...
the
appeal
court
said
that
they
were
free
to
change
their
mind...
the
judge
was
free
to
change
their
mind
any
time
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment.
so
the
courts...
there
is...
there
is
no
established
precedent
with
respect
to
reconsideration,
and
we
would
respectfully
say
that
alternatively
this
court
ought
to
find
a
rule
that
trial
courts
can
reconsider
where
there
has
been
no
appeal
and
also...
and
we
would
argue
that
the--
mr.
arthur
a.
busch
--thank
you.
