mr.
busch,
why
wouldn't
it
be
unreasonable
if,
as
respondent
asserts,
the
michigan
rules
provide
that
a
directed
verdict
made
at
the
close
of
the
evidence,
that
the
judge
may
not
reserve
decision,
must
decide
it,
may
not
reserve
decision.
i
think
that's
what
the
judge
ended
up
doing
here,
is
that
not
so?
when
he
reconsidered,
he
reserved
decision
'til
the
end
of
the
defense
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they...
did
they
address...
i
didn't
notice
that
the
court
had
addressed
the
michigan
rule
that
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
can't
reserve
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you
have
the
rule,
the
rule
of
criminal
procedure,
so
we'll
know...
that
might
give
us
the
answer
to
this
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
michigan
rule
that
says
the
trial
judge
shall
not
reserve
decision
on
the
defendant's
motion.
does
that
rule
apply
when
the
motion
is
made
at
the
close
of
the
prosecutor's
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
respondent's
brief,
it's
put
in
quotes.
and
it
sounds
like
it's
quoting
from
a
rule,
6.419(a).
quote:
the
court
may
not
reserve
decision
on
the
defendant's
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
those
words
appear
in
the
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
29?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
cert
petition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
footnoted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
say
that
if
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
the
defendant
was
operating
under
the
impression
that
the...
if
the
defendant
didn't
know
before
he
put
on
his
case,
would
it
be
too
late
for
the
judge
to
change
his
mind
at
the
end
of
the
defense
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
we
follow
the
position
that
you're
urging
and...
and
the
judge
rules,
as
here,
premeditation
is
out
of
the
case,
i'm
not
going
to
charge
first
degree,
defendant
puts
on
defendant's
case
on
the
assumption
first
degree
is
out
of
the
case
and
then
the
judge
says
at
the
end,
oh,
sorry,
i'm
reversing
and
i'm
going
to
charge.
now,
you
say
the
judge
can
change
his
mind
at
any
time
'til
the
end
of
the
line.
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
grossly
unfair
to
a
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he...
he
didn't
say,
i
acquit.
the
judge
himself
said
this
at
the
trial,
he
said,
i
didn't
enter
a
directed
verdict.
i
granted
a
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
you're
urging
is
so
different
from
how
we
approach
trial
rulings
generally,
and
the
point
was
made
that
in
a
trial,
things
go
fast,
judge...
judges
make
rulings.
it's
very
common,
is
it
not,
for
a
judge
to
make
a
ruling
and
then
go
home
that
night,
maybe
read
over
the
daily
transcript,
maybe
have
her
law
clerk
check
a
few
authorities,
and
say,
oh,
my
goodness,
i
made
a
mistake,
the
next
morning.
you
couldn't
run
trials...
i
mean,
the
trial
judges
don't
have
the
luxury
that
appellate
judges
do
in
that
regard.
they
have
to
make
rulings
on
the
spot,
and
they
can
revisit
them.
you...
you
are
suggesting
that
this
rule,
like
no
other,
is...
once
the
judge
utters
the
words,
motion
granted,
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what's
different
between--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--saying
at
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
i
grant
your
motion,
and
then
overnight...
and
then
they
come
back
the
next
morning
and
the
judge
says,
i'm
not
so
sure.
prosecutor,
tell
me
more
about
this.
what's
the
difference
of
the
overnight
interval?
nothing
has
happened.
the
trial
hasn't
gone
on.
no
witnesses
have
appeared.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
follow
you
because
i
thought
the
judge
in
smalis
was
firm
throughout,
that
he
never
equivocated
about
what
his
ruling
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
he
came
up
just
where
he
was
the
first
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
were
all--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
his
lawyer
knew.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
you
would.
you
would
have
defended
your
client
as
best
you
could,
and
you
would
know
that
you
could
not
treat
with
security
what
the
judge
had
said.
if
you
did,
you
were
endangering
your
client--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
the
judge
had
signaled
that
he
might
reverse
his
ruling--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
at
trial
the
next
morning,
if
what
you
say
about
the
overnight
being
so
critical
to
the
strategic
planning,
then
counsel
could
say,
judge,
we
plotted
all
this
thing
out,
give
me
a
recess
so
we
can
reshuffle
the
thing.
at
that
point,
if
there
was
any
detrimental
reliance,
the
way
to
do
it
was
to
give
back
the
hours
that
had
been
lost.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wasn't
requested,
though.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
moran,
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
an
aedpa
question,
and
that
is,
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
a
division
among
lower
courts
on
just
how
much
leeway
a
trial
judge
has
to
take
back
a
directed
verdict.
and
if
there
is
disarray
in
the
lower
courts,
how
can
we
say
there's
clearly
established
law
in
your
favor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
kept
saying
i
didn't
direct
a
verdict.
he
was
distinguishing
as
between
granting
a
motion.
he
says,
i
granted
a
motion,
but
i
didn't
direct
a
verdict.
