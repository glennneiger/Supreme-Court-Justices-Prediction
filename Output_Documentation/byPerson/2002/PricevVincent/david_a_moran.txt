mr.
david
a.
moran
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first
of
all,
a
brief
factual
correction.
the
change
in
the
judge's
ruling
did
not
occur
before
mr.
vincent
testified.
the
change
in
the
judge's
ruling
occurred
on
april
2nd,
1992,
2
days
after
the
ruling
had
been
made
after
mr.
vincent
had
testified.
what
happened
on
april
1st,
1992
was
the
judge
indicated
that
he
would
reconsider
his
motion
and
hold
it
in
abeyance,
but
he
did
not,
at
that
time,
take
back
the
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
mr.
david
a.
moran
he...
he
took
the
position,
justice
scalia,
that
he
could
take
back
his
ruling
because
he
had
not
informed
the
jury
of
it.
mr.
david
a.
moran
a
position
that
we
submit
is
wrong
under
this
court's
precedent
in
sanabria.
mr.
david
a.
moran
what
a
reviewing
court
has
to
do
under
this
precedent
in
martin
linen,
justice
scalia,
is
look
at
the
words
and
actions
of
the
trial
court
and
decide
whether
or
not
it
amounts
to
a
ruling.
now,
in
this
case--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
actually,
justice
scalia,
it's
petitioner
who's
arguing
for
a
magic
words
approach,
or
the
michigan
supreme
court
at
least.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
justice
scalia,
our
position
is,
is
that
the
trial
judge's
intent
is
a
relevant
fact,
but
whether
or
not
what
he
did
amounted
to
an
acquittal--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--is
a
question
of
law.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
what
we
attacked
in
federal
district
court
on
habeas
was
the
michigan
supreme
court's
conclusion
that
there
had
never
been
an
acquittal
at
all,
and
we
persuaded
the
federal
district
judge
and
the
sixth
circuit
that
the
michigan
supreme
court's
conclusion
that
there
had
not
been
an
acquittal
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
this
court's
precedents,
particularly
ball,
kepner,
green,
because
the
michigan
supreme
court
placed
primary
emphasis
on
the
absence
of
formal
trappings,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
even
in
the
absence
of
any
written
judgment
at
all,
as
in
ball
and
kepner,
that
a
final
directed...
a
verdict
of
acquittal
is
final.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
this
court's
precedents,
particularly
martin
linen,
teach
that
what
the
reviewing
court
is
supposed
to
do
is
look
not
to
the
form
of
the
trial
court's
ruling
but
the
substance.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
smalis,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
moran
smalis
came
from
a
state
court.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that's
right.
in
this
case,
however,
if
you
look
at
the
full
record,
the
trial
judge
himself...
and
if
we
get
to
the
issue
of
intent,
justice
scalia...
the
trial
judge
himself
says
over
and
over,
i
made
a
ruling,
i
came
to
a
conclusion,
i
made
a
decision,
and
even
at
one
point,
i
granted
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict.
he
took
the
position
simply
as
a
matter
of
law,
double
jeopardy
law,
federal
double
jeopardy
law.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it
was
a...
it
was
its
legal
conclusion--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that
there
had
been
no--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--no.
but
it--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--mr.
chief
justice,
it
matters
for
aedpa
whether
it's
law
or
fact
because
then
we're
under
(d)(1)
or
(d)(2).
mr.
david
a.
moran
and
so--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
it
is
our
position
that
we
win
under
either
because
even
if
it's
a
finding
of
fact,
it's
so
unreasonable
to
say
that
there
was
no
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
here,
that
we
should
prevail.
but--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
moran
oh,
that's
not
quite
right,
justice
scalia.
what...
what
the
michigan
supreme
court
ruled
or
stated
was
they
agreed
with
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and
the
dissenters
in
the
michigan
supreme
court
that
characterizing
the
trial
judge's
comments
as
an
acquittal
would
require
us
to
reverse
mr.
vincent's
conviction.
the
michigan
supreme
court
actually
said
that.
so
they...
and
that
was
after
a
discussion
of
smalis.
both
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and
the
michigan
supreme
court,
after
reviewing
this
court's
decision
in
smalis,
like
so
many
other
lower
courts,
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
what
a
trial
judge
may
not
do,
consistent
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
is
revisit
a
directed
verdict
at
any
point
later
in
the
trial.
mr.
david
a.
moran
not
at
all,
justice
breyer.
mr.
david
a.
moran
no.
the
difference
between
that
and
this
is
that
the
ruling
is
not
final.
here
the
ruling
was
unquestionably
final.
the
judge--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
david
a.
moran
because
the
judge
announced
his
ruling.
all
the
parties,
including
the
judge,
understood
that
under
michigan
court
rules,
the
judge
could
not
reserve
his
decision,
had
to
make
it.
he
did
so.
he
announced
his
decision.
he
said,
okay.
is
there
anything
else?
mr.
david
a.
moran
it...
the...
the
court
rule
doesn't
say
that.
the
court
rule
says--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--the
michigan
rule...
i...
i
don't...
frankly,
i
don't
know
because
the
michigan
rule
simply
says
the
judge
may
not
reserve
his
decision.
mr.
david
a.
moran
in...
in
that
case
that
would...
that
might
well
be
all
right
because
he
hasn't
made
a
final
decision.
the
problem
here...
we're
not--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's
very
similar
to
lowe
v.
state
in
the
kansas
case
in
which
the
kansas
supreme
court,
after
this
court's
decision
in
smalis,
concluded
that
a
judge
couldn't
do
that
even
though
there
had
been
no
intervening
proceedings.
the
judge
had--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--an
acquittal
is
final.
that
is
the
most
fundamental
rule
of
this
court's
double
jeopardy--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--but,
your
honor,
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
an
acquittal
by
a
judge,
in
the
context
of
a
directed
verdict,
is
equivalent
to
an
acquittal
by
a
jury.
and
the
same--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i'm
not
arguing
that,
justice
ginsburg.
i
am
taking
the
position
that
if
the
judge
immediately
corrects
a
mistake,
as
happened
in
people
v.
vilt,
a
case
relied
upon
by
the
petitioner,
that's
different.
mr.
david
a.
moran
but,
your
honor,
if
that
was
the
law,
then
smalis
v.
pennsylvania
is
impossible
to
understand
because
in
smalis
the
prosecution
there
could
have
taken
some
sort
of
emergency
appeal
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme...
pennsylvania
superior
court,
got
a
ruling
late
that
afternoon,
and
come
back
the
next
morning
and
resumed
the
trial.
and
in
fact,
the
prosecution
tried
exactly
that
in
a
tenth
circuit
case,
united
states
versus
eliason.
mr.
david
a.
moran
actually
the
judge
in
smalis
agreed
to
a
reconsideration
motion--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes,
that's...
that's
right.
what
i'm
saying
is,
is
that
if
double
jeopardy
doesn't
protect...
if
there's
no
double
jeopardy
violation,
if
it
can
be
revisited
quickly,
then
smalis
is
impossible
to
understand
because
smalis
then
would
simply
come
down
to
if
you
can
do
it
quickly,
if
you
can
get
an
appeal
to
a
higher
court
and
a
reversal
quickly--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes,
justice
scalia.
and...
and
the
point
of
that
argument
is
that
it
makes
it
completely
dispositive
as
to
whether
there
are
other
defendants
remaining,
as
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
if--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--if
no
further
proceedings
have
occurred,
and
that
is
the
line
that
almost
all--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--first
of
all,
justice
breyer,
he
said,
i
granted
the
motion.
he
took
the
position
as
a
matter--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--and
he
came
back
the
next
morning
and
said
i
granted
your
motion.
he
took
the
position
that
it
didn't
count--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
if
further
proceedings
have
occurred,
which
unquestionably
occurred
here,
then
followed
by
an
overnight
recess,
during
a
trial
a
defendant--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--there
were
five
pages
of
proceedings
that
are--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--no.
on...
on
joint
appendix
pages
13
through
18,
the
parties
litigated
a
number
of
other
matters,
including
in
which
order
will--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--not
at
that
point,
no.
but
what--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--we
know
that
his
attorney
made
decisions
on
matters
such
as
who
is
going
to
go
first,
will
the
defendants
be
present
for
each
other's
juries,
will
witnesses
be
allowed
in
the
courtroom,
a
sequestration
order.
he
made
those
decisions
at
a
point
when
his
client
had
been
acquitted
of
first
degree
murder.
mr.
david
a.
moran
we
simply
don't
know,
justice
souter.
it's
a--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
well,
first
of
all,
on
those
particular
decisions,
we
don't
know
and
it's
impossible
to
reconstruct
that
at
this
point.
what
we
do
know
is
that
during
the
overnight
recess,
mr.
vincent
and
his
attorney...
as
this
court
noted
in
geders
versus
the
united
states,
an
overnight
recess
during
a
trial
is
a
critical
time
to
make
crucial
decisions--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's
actually
not
quite
true
as
to
mr.
vincent.
mr.
vincent
was
removed
from
the
courtroom
before
the
prosecutor
said
i
would
like
to
make
a
brief
restatement
on
first
degree--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--his
lawyer
was
still
there.
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
moran
the
ruling
had
not
been
taken
back,
though,
justice
souter.
all--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--what...
all
he
agreed
to
do
is
hear
more
argument.
he
did...
in
no
way
indicate--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--it
suggests
it,
but
it...
he
certainly
doesn't
say
it.
mr.
david
a.
moran
all...
he
makes
a
general
statement--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--if
i
had
been
in
trial
counsel's
position,
i
wouldn't
have
known
what
to
do
because
we
have
a--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--but--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--but--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--as
trial
counsel
stated
the
next
morning,
it
was
my
impression
that
you
made
a
firm
ruling,
judge.
so--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
don't
know
if
that
would
be
possible
with
a...
with
two
juries.
there
were
actually
two
juries
in
this
case
sitting
around
waiting
for
the
defense
to--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--it...
it
wasn't
requested
because
at
the
end
of
the
hearing,
in
which
the
prosecution
made
his
improved
closing
argument
to
the
judge,
there
was
no
ruling.
the
judge
simply
said,
i'm
going
to
think
about
it.
i'm
going
to
take
it
under
advisement.
he
didn't
make
the
ruling
until
after
mr.
vincent
testified.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
agree.
this
court's
precedents--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--and--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--and
i've
taken
the
position
in
the
brief
that
we
don't
have
to
show
prejudice.
under
double
jeopardy,
the
prejudice
is--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--is
inherent
in
being
subjected
to
post-acquittal
fact-finding
proceedings.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
agree.
mr.
david
a.
moran
justice
breyer,
yes.
and...
and
the
reason--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--the
rule
from
the
solicitor
general's
position
would
make
it
completely
dispositive
as
to
whether
there
happened
to
be
other
charges
remaining,
as
in
smalis
itself,
and
whether
or
not
there
happened
to
be
other
defendants.
mr.
david
a.
moran
if
they're
correct
that
it
was
not
an
acquittal.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
agree.
but
if
you
look
at
the
trial
judge's
comments,
he
consistently
maintains
that
he...
he
made
a
ruling.
and
ruling
is
actually
the
exact
word
from
martin
linen,
that
this
court
has
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
made
a
ruling.
mr.
david
a.
moran
because
what...
what
aedpa
requires
is
not
to
look
at
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts,
but
to
look
to
see
whether
the
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
a
clearly
unreasonable
application.
now,
i
should
point
out,
first
of
all,
on
that
issue
whether
a
judge
can
take
back
a
directed
verdict,
the
michigan
supreme
court
did
not
rule
against
us,
in
fact
indicated
that
it
agreed
with
our
position
that
a
judge
may
not
take
back
a
directed
verdict
if
he
had...
if
he
has
actually
rendered
one.
and
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
ruled
the
same
way.
but
if
you
look
at
the
split
of
authority,
it's
a
very
striking
split
of
authority.
the
cases
that
cite
and
rely
upon
smalis
on
very
similar
situations
where
there
is
a
directed
verdict,
a
partial
directed
verdict
during
an
ongoing
trial,
so
the
trial
continues,
and
then
the
judge
attempts
to
take
back
the
directed
verdict
at
some
point
later
in
the
trial,
those
courts
that
have
applied
smalis
have,
with
one
exception,
held
that
the
judge
cannot
do
it.
those
courts
that
have
gone
the
other
way
have
almost
uniformly
relied
on
a
second
circuit
decision,
united
states
versus
lorusso,
which
says
that
there
is
no
problem
with
doing
that
because
it
does
not
result
in
a
second
trial.
and
what
this
court
could
not
have
been
more
clear
about
in
smalis
is
that
a
double
jeopardy
is
violated
not
only
if
a
reversal
of
a
directed
verdict
would
result
in
a
second
trial,
but
if
it
would
result
in
a
continuation
of
the
same
trial.
and
that
is
why
this
case
is
constitutionally
indistinguishable
from
smalis.
the
only
difference
between
this
case
and
smalis
is
that
instead
of
going
to
a
higher
court,
as
was
attempted
by...
in
the
tenth
circuit
in
united
states
versus
ellison,
what
happened
there
is
that
the
prosecution...
there
was
a
partial
directed
verdict,
exactly
as
in
this
case.
the
prosecution
ran
across--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
there
was
doubt
as
to
what
the
judge
had
done.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
said
it
wasn't
a
directed
verdict
because
it
was
a
legal
ruling
and
not
a...
not--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
no,
and
that
is...
and
that
is
a
distinction.
that's
why
we
have
an
issue
one,
mr.
chief
justice,
is...
is,
of
course,
we
have
to
get
past
the
issue
of
was
there
a
directed
verdict.
then
we
get
to
issue
two.
if
there
was
a
directed
verdict,
can
the
judge
take
it
back?
and
that
is
where
i
maintain
that
this
case
is
constitutionally
indistinguishable
from
smalis.
on...
on
issue
one,
i...
i
just
wanted
to
make
a
further
point
about
whether
this
is
fact
finding
or
a
legal
finding.
the
michigan
supreme
court
itself
did
not
regard
what
it
was
doing
as
fact
finding.
there
was
not
the
slightest
indication
in
the
michigan
supreme
court's
opinion
that
it
thought
it
was
engaged
in
fact
finding.
nor
did
this
court
think
that
it
was
engaged
in
fact
finding
in
several
cases
in
which
this
court
has
examined
arguably
ambiguous
district
court
transcripts
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
acquittal
had
been
granted,
for
example,
scott
and
even
more
clearly,
sanabria.
in
sanabria,
this
court
had
to
wade
through
a
difficult
record
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
district
court
had,
in
fact,
granted
a
directed
verdict
on
both
theories,
numbers
theory
and
horse
betting
theory.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
i
believe
that
follows
immediately,
well,
first
of
all,
from
maryland
v.
benton
which
applies
double
jeopardy
clause
to
the
states,
but
also
from
crist--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--no.
but
it
also
follows
from
crist
v.
bretz
in
which
this
court
rejected
a...
montana's
attempt
to
declare
that
jeopardy
doesn't
attach
until
the
first
witness
is
sworn
in
a
jury
trial.
and
this
court
said,
no.
where...
where
jeopardy
attaches
and
terminates
is
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
and
it
concluded,
therefore,
that
montana
must
follow
the
federal
rule
to
that
point
which
is
that
jeopardy
attaches
when
the
jury
is
sworn.
and
so
this
court
has
consistently
applied
the
same
principles
about
jeopardy-attaching
and
jeopardy-terminating
events
whether
the
cases
arise
in
state
or
federal
court.
mr.
david
a.
moran
your
honor,
i
find
that--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--justice
scalia,
i
find
that
hard
to
square
with
martin
linen
which
teaches
us
that
what
a
reviewing
court
must
do
is
putting
aside
form,
looking
at
substance
to
decide
whether
the
trial
court
has
found
an
essential
element
of
the
offense
is
missing.
and
here,
the
trial
judge
clearly
stated
that
there
is
no
premeditation
been
shown,
that
therefore
second
degree
murder
is
the
appropriate
charge,
that
a
docket
entry
that
could
not
have
been
more
clear
was
made
to
that
effect
on
that
day,
march
31st,
1992,
and
then
followed
by
at
least
five
statements
by
the
trial
judge
over
the
next
2
days
explaining
that
he
had
made
a
ruling,
that
he
had
directed
a
verdict,
come
to
a
conclusion
and
made
a
decision--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--excuse
me,
justice
ginsburg.
you're
quite
correct.
he
said,
i
granted
a
motion.
i
didn't
direct
a
verdict.
and
his
distinction
was
clearly
one
of
law.
he
clearly
believed
that
so
long
as
the
jury
was
not
told,
there
was
a
distinction
between
granting
a
motion
and
directing
a
verdict.
and
that
position
is
untenable
after
sanabria
versus
united
states
and
also
martin
linen
where
the...
the
united
states
made
the
same
argument
in
martin
linen,
that
as
long
as
it's
the
judge
after
the
hung
jury
declaring
a...
an
acquittal,
if
it
doesn't
involve
the
jury
in
some
way,
it
doesn't
count.
the
same
argument
was
apparently
made
in
sanabria
and
dismissed
in
a
footnote
that
it
was
so
obviously...
so
obviously
contrary
to
martin
linen.
and
so
the
judge
never
said
as
a
fact...
as
a
fact...
i
did
not
find
absence
of
premeditation.
he
clearly
found
absence
of
premeditation,
consistently
admitted
that
that's
what
he
had
done,
but
simply
believed,
as
a
matter
of
double
jeopardy
law,
wrong
as
a
matter
of
double
jeopardy
law,
that
he
could
take
back
that
decision.
the
michigan
supreme
court's
conclusion
was
contrary
even
under
the
criteria
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
adopted,
wanting
to
see
certain
formalities
before
they
would
conclude
that
a
acquittal
has
been
granted.
that
standard
was
met
here.
the
michigan
supreme
court
itself
acknowledged
that
a
docket
entry
is
exactly
the
sort
of
formality
that
they
were
looking
for
but
then
inexplicably
failed
to
notice
that
there
had
been
such
a
docket
entry
made
in
this
case.
not
inexplicably
the
state
failed
to
include
the
docket
entry
in
its
appendix
in
violation
of
the
michigan
court
rules.
that's
why
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
apparently
unaware
of
the
dispositive
docket
entry.
mr.
david
a.
moran
there
was
a
motion
for
reconsideration
filed,
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
a.
moran
like
this
court's
denial
of
certiorari
there--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i...
i
believe
it
is.
an
appeal
to
the
michigan
supreme
court
is
a
discretionary
matter
in
the
first
place.
and
the
denial
of
reconsideration
is
traditionally
treated
as
a
discretionary
matter
under
michigan
law.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
it's
an
error
in
the
record
i
believe.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i...
i
can't
explain
it.
it
was
a
5
to
2
vote
for
denial
of
reconsideration.
i
simply
can't
explain
how
they
came
to
that
conclusion.
the
bottom
line
here
was,
was
mr.
vincent
subjected
to
post-acquittal
fact-finding
proceedings
in
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
exactly
as
in
smalis,
he
was.
smalis...
there
would
have
been
post-acquittal
fact-finding
proceedings--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
there
has
been
any
case
distinguishing
an
acquittal,
in
quotation
marks,
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
from
any
other
sort
of
an
acquittal.
an
acquittal
is
defined
in
martin
linen
and
this
court's--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
believe
he
was
acquitted
for
all
purposes,
justice
stevens.
i...
i
don't
believe
that
one
can
profitably
draw
a
distinction
between
being
acquitted
for
one
purpose
or
another.
