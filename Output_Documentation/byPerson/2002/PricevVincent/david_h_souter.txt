justice
david
h.
souter
may
i...
may
i
just
ask
you
a
further
question
to
make
sure
that
i
understand
the...
the
sort
of
the
assumption
behind
your
argument?
and
it's
really
the
same
question
that
justice
breyer
and
justice
scalia
i
think
were...
were
raising.
my
understanding
is
that
the
courts,
up
to
this
point,
have
treated
the
issue
here
as
an
issue
of
fact.
what
was
the
judge...
what
did
the
judge
think
he
was
doing?
did
he
understand
or
could
one
reasonably
understand
that
the
had
made
a
final
ruling
or
not?
it
might
also
have
been
treated
as
an
issue
of
law.
given
what
the
judge
did,
even
if
he
thought
he
had
made
a
final
ruling,
he
might,
as
a
matter
of
law,
consistent
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
have
been
able
to
change
his
mind
if
he
hadn't
issued
a
formal
order
and
if
no
one
had
acted
in
reliance.
but
i
understand
that
legal
question,
the
way
i
just
put
it,
is
not
the
question
that
people
understood
has
been
decided
in
this
case,
and
that
everybody
is
treating
this
as
a...
as
an
issue
of
the
factual
question
and
that's
what
you're
addressing.
am
i
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
has
the
rule,
as
you
just
quoted
it,
got
to
do
with...
with
reservation?
in
other
words,
the
judge
can
say,
my
reasons
are
a,
b,
and
c,
but
i'm
going
to
sleep
on
it,
and...
and
tomorrow
morning
i
may
come
up
with
d
and...
and
rule
the
other
way.
i
mean,
what's
that...
what's
it
got
to
do
with
reservation,
his...
his
reserving
his
right
to
change
the
ruling
at
a
later
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
does
the
rule
address
that?
i
mean,
justice
ginsburg
asked
a
question
going
to
reasonableness
that
depended
on
what
she
understood
from
the...
from
the
briefs
to
be
a
michigan
rule
saying
the
judge
can't
reserve
his
right
to
change
his
mind
later
or
reserve
judgment
on
the
motion
when
it's
made.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
mr.
busch,
may
i
make
this
suggestion?
it
seems
to
me
the
rule
distinguishes
between
motions
made
after
the
prosecution
has
rested
and
motions
made
after
the
entire
case
is
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
says
in
the
latter
case,
the
judge
can
reserve,
take
his
time
on
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to...
it
strikes
me,
just
reading
the
thing,
that
the
point
of
the
rule
is
that
before
the
defense
goes
forward,
the
defense
has
a
right
to
know
what
the
ruling
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
in
this
case
before
the
defense
went
forward,
it
knew
what
the
ruling
was
because
the
judge
had
come
in
the
next
morning
and
said,
okay,
i...
you
know,
i've...
i'm
going
to
listen
to
you
again.
i've
listened
to
you
again,
and...
and,
in
point
of
fact,
i'm...
i'm
not
going
to
grant
the
motion.
and
isn't
that
enough
to
satisfy
what
seems
to
be
the
point
of
the
rule,
and
that
is,
before
a
defendant
goes
forward
with
a
case,
he's
got
to
know
whether
he
has
to
or
not?
isn't...
don't...
isn't
that
a
fair
way
of
reading
this
thing?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
before
he...
before
he
went
forward
with
his
evidence,
the
judge
had
changed
his
mind
or
come
to
a
further,
more
final
conclusion,
however
you
want
to
characterize
it,
so
that
before
he
went
forward,
he
knew
the
judge
was
saying,
no,
i'm
not
throwing
out
the
first
degree
murder
charge.
and
isn't
that
enough
under
the
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--why?
justice
david
h.
souter
there
was
nothing
that...
that
was
done
to
the
defendant
that
the
defendant
himself
did
to
his
detriment.
--we
don't
know
because
all
we
know--
well,
have
we
any
reason
to
believe?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
those
decisions
would
have
been
different
if
he
had
understood
that
first
degree
murder
was
going
to
be
in
the
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
don't...
we
don't
know
in
the
sense
that
there...
there
hasn't
apparently
been
specific
litigation
to
that
effect,
but
is
there
any
reason
to
suspect
that
the
decisions
would
have
been
different?
in
other
words,
is
there
any
reason
whatever
to...
to
think
that
there
may
have
been
detrimental
reliance
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
there
is,
but
what...
what
is
it
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i...
i
realize
that,
but
by
the
time
he
departed
for
the
overnight
recess,
he
knew
that
the
judge
was
going
to
take
the
matter
up
again
the
next
morning.
the
judge
had
said
so.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
his...
his
counsel
knew.
his
counsel
knew.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
so...
so
if...
if
he...
if
he
relied
upon
there
being
no
change
in
the
ruling,
he
was
doing
so
at
his
peril,
was
he
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
always
glad
to
hear
people.
he
made
it...
he
couldn't
have
made
it
more
clear
that
he
did
not
understand
that
he
had
come
to
a
final
conclusion
on
that
motion,
could
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
as
a
betting
man,
would--
justice
david
h.
souter
--would
you
not
assume
that
there
might
be
a
change
as
a
result
of
what
he
had
said
before
they
recessed?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
syllogism
is
that
if
he
was
acquitted
as
a
matter
of
michigan
law,
a
fortiori
the
double
jeopardy
clause
applies
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
