justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sure
actually...
your
inference.
i
mean,
it's
quite
a
fine
point,
but
i
guess
i
wouldn't
say
necessarily
that
what
he
meant
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
that
is,
he
said
certain
things
in
the
world,
and
if
he
had
a
secret
meaning,
we
don't
care
nor
does
the
law.
but
having
said
these
particular
things
in
the
world,
then
the
question
would
be,
can
the
michigan
supreme
court...
does
it...
did
it...
it
characterized
those
things,
and
it
said
as
a
matter
of
michigan
law,
those
things
said
in
the
world
do
not
amount
to
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
so
then
i
guess
we
would...
if
that's
the
way
to
look
at
it,
then
we
would
have
the
problem
of
deciding
whether,
even
though
as
a
matter
of
michigan
law,
those
events
that
took
place
in
the
world
do
not
amount
to
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
nonetheless,
for
purposes
of
the
federal
double
jeopardy
clause,
do
they
amount
to
a
judgment
of
acquittal?
those
would
be
two
legal
questions.
one,
a
state
law
question,
and
one,
a
federal
question,
and
no
factual
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
something
of
a
quibble
because
i
don't
know
that
leads
us
to
a
different
place.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
docket
entry?
was
there
a
docket
entry
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do...
do
we
have
the
full
text
of
this
rule
before
us?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
little
hard
to
understand
that.
anyway,
they
said
it
was
harmless
error.
the...
the
court...
the
courts...
the
michigan
court
said
it's
harmless
error,
all
right.
but
it's
a
little
hard
to
understand.
it
says
you...
you...
the
prosecution
finishes
the
case.
the
defendant
then
says,
judge,
i
move
for
a
directed
verdict.
all
right?
or
a
failure
of
proof,
whatever
the
words
are.
then
it
says
the
judge
could
give
his
reasons
in
writing...
i
mean,
that's
one
way...
or
orally.
how
is
the
judge
supposed
to
do
this
without
taking
some
time?
what
does
reserve
there
mean?
does
it
mean
he
has
to
pass
on
it
before
they
present
the...
the...
he
has
to
decide
it
before
the
defense
presents
its
case?
does
it
mean
you
can't
reserve
it
'til
after
the
defense
has
presented
the
case?
does
it
mean
you
have
to
rule
instantly?
what
does
it
mean?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
can't
mean
instantly.
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
in
fong
foo
when
judge
wyzanski
i
think
got
angry
at
the
prosecution
for
some
reason
that
escaped
the
court
and
everyone
else,
directs
an
acquittal,
what
the
prosecutor
should
have
done
is
just
go
back
to
judge
wyzanski
and
say,
judge,
you
made
a
mistake
here.
i
haven't
been
talking
to
the
witness
in
the
hall
as
you
thought,
or
whatever,
and
then
judge
wyzanski
could
have,
in
fact,
taken
back
the...
the
judgment
of
the
directed...
directed
verdict
of
acquittal,
although
this
court
later
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
do
it
in
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
could
be,
but
presumably
michigan
knows
michigan
law,
and
if
they
want
to
say,
under
the
law
of
michigan,
the
events
that
took
place
here
do
not
amount
to
an
acquittal,
i
guess
that's
their
right.
now,
is
there
anything
in
the
cases
that
you
cite
which
says
that
federal
law
requires
michigan
to
count
these
things
as
an
acquittal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
it
happens
in
michigan
they
don't
do
that.
in
michigan,
they
have
the
michigan
system.
now,
what
is
it
that
tells
michigan
you
have
to,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
count
this
as
an
acquittal?
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
there
are
cases
where
the
court
has
said
this
is
an
acquittal,
but
i
don't
think
they're
faced
in
those
cases
with
a
state
court
that
says
the
contrary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
suppose
that
what
he
says
is,
i
direct
the
verdict.
there
are
two
defendants,
smith
and
brown,
and
the
judge
says,
i
direct
a
verdict
in
favor
of
smith.
oh,
my
goodness.
i
said
the
wrong
thing.
brown.
okay?
that's
what
happens.
are
you
saying
the
constitution
then
just
means
that
smith
is
home
free?
can't
try
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
and
the
difference
between
that
and
this
is
what?
12
hours?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how?
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
how?
explain
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
reserve
means,
i
take
it,
that
you
have
to
make
a
decision
prior
to
the...
the
defendant
putting
on
witnesses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
i
read
the
court
rule
and
then
read
the
federal
rule,
the
difference
in
the
practice
is
what
they
mean
by
reserve
under
the
federal
rule
where
you
can
reserve...
and
it
happens
every
day...
is
a
district
judge
says,
you
move
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiff's
case.
i'm
the
district
judge.
i
say
i'm
going
to
let
it
go
to
the
jury.
if
the
jury
acquits,
you're
home
free.
if
it
convicts,
i'll
go
back
to
it.
that
happens
all
the
time.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
what
the
michigan
rule
says
can't
happen
in
michigan--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that...
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far
at
all.
i
mean,
smalis
is
not
a
case
where
the
judge
changed
his
mind,
i
take
it.
and
this
is
a
case
where
the
judge
changed
his
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i'm
back
to
my
first
question.
the
judge
says,
smith,
you're
acquitted.
and
10
minutes
later
he
says,
oh,
my
goodness,
i
used
the
wrong
name.
it
was
brown.
now,
you're
saying
they
can't
retry
smith?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
goodness,
nothing
at
all
happened
in
those
10
minutes.
they
were
out
drinking
some
water.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
what...
what
proceeding
occurred?
no
proceeding
occurred.
they
adjourned
for
the
evening.
he
comes
back
the
next
day
and,
at
best,
he
says
for
you,
well,
i
misspoke.
i...
i
didn't
grant
the
motion.
so
what's
the
difference
whether...
we're
back
to
justice
ginsburg.
we're
all
pursuing
exactly
same
thing
which
i'm
having
trouble
with,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
does...
so
does
my
judge.
i
grant
the
motion.
smith...
smith
is
acquitted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he
says,
i
say
i
granted
the
motion.
i
acquitted
smith,
but
i
misspoke.
it
was
brown
i
meant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
that
in
my
case
too
smith
is
home
free.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
you
mean
they
spoke
some
more.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we
still
have
good
old
lucky
smith
who...
who
got
off
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--five
pages...
of
five
pages
of
extraneous
conversation
went
on
with
the...
the
judge
and
counsel.
and
i
take
it
now
you're
going
to
say,
yes,
he
got
off.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
okay.
that's
what
i
thought
you
would
say.
that's
all
right.
that's
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
that
may
be
true.
that's
why
i'm
nervous
about
the
position.
but
still,
you
from
your
point
of
view,
unfortunately,
lose
as
long
as
michigan
was...
was
at
least
within
the
discretion
that
federal
law
grants
them
in
characterizing
what
happened
here
as
not
an
acquittal.
i'm
right
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
not
correct.
they...
they
have
a
degree
of...
even
under
the
law,
that's...
i
mean,
under
the
law
section
too.
