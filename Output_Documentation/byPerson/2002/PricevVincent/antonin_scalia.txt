justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
there
are
really
three
questions,
aren't
there?
one
is
what
he
said,
and
there...
as
the
chief
justice
says,
there's
no
dispute
on
what
he
said.
the
second
question
is
what
he
meant
by
what
he
said.
and
the
third
question
is,
once
you
know
what
he
meant,
at
law
does
that
constitute
a...
a
final
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
are
three
questions,
and...
and
which
one...
is
the
middle
one,
what
he
meant,
as
opposed
to
what
he
said...
is
that
a
factual
or
a...
or
a
legal
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean.
are
you
addressing
justice
ginsburg's
question?
she's
talking
about
the
rule
that
says
you
can't
reserve--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
a
motion
is
made
at
the
close
of
all...
was
this
motion
made
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what
the
rule
applies
to?
at
the
close
of
the
prosecutor's
proof?
or
does
it
apply
to
only
when
the
whole
trial
has
been
completed?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
quoted
there
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
and
what
motion
does
it
refer
to?
a
motion
made
at
what
point?
at
any
point
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
after
two
witnesses
are
called
by
the
prosecution,
the
motion
can
be
made
and
the
judge
cannot
reserve?
justice
antonin
scalia
29.
justice
antonin
scalia
petitioner's
appendix?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
cert
petition.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
we
never
reach
your...
your
argument,
do
we,
if
we
decide
this
on
the
2254
ground.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
shouldn't
reach
your
ground
unless
we
have
to,
should
we?
because
your
ground
is
a
constitutional
ground.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
we
try
to
avoid
deciding
constitutional
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
sort
of
a
special
situation
because
in
those
situations
you
could
never
get
the
answer
if
you
always
decided
it
on...
on
immunity
grounds.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
parties
can...
can
repudiate
a
contract,
can't
they,
since
there's
no...
no
involuntary
servitude?
but
the
mere
fact
that
one
party
to
a
contract
knows
that
the
other
party
can
repudiate
it,
does
not
mean
that
the
repudiation
can
be
cost-free.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
party
is
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
contract
despite
his
knowledge
that
it
can
be
repudiated.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
didn't
take
it
back,
but
he
made
it
clear
that
he...
he
did
not
consider
it...
he
did
not
consider
that
he
had
made
a
final
ruling.
at
least
that
was
clear.
it
was
clear
that
no
final
ruling
had
been
made
before
the
testimony
occurred.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i...
can
i
ask
you,
do
you
believe
like
justice
breyer
that
a
judge
can
enter
a
final
order
without
meaning
to
enter
a
final
order?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
you
do
that
just
objectively,
and
even
if
there's
plenty
of
evidence
that
the
judge
didn't
intend
it
to
be
a
final
ruling,
if
he
used
certain
magic
words,
it's
a
final...
it's
a
final
ruling.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i...
i
don't
know
who...
who...
in
whose
favor
it
breaks.
i'm
just
asking
what
your
position
on
it
is,
whether...
whether...
because
on
that...
on
that
question
hinges
whether
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
question
of
fact,
as
we
would
be
in
interpreting...
in...
in
deciding,
you
know,
what
he
intended,
or
a
question
of
law,
as
we
would
be
in
interpreting
the
words
of
a
contract
where
indeed
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
parties
intended.
if
they
express
themselves
this
way,
you...
you
take
the
objective
meaning
of
it.
right?
and
that's
a
question
of
law
for
the
court
and
not
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
a
question
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
anyway,
the
michigan
supreme
court
didn't
find
the
fact
against
you,
did
it?
it
just...
i...
as
i
understand
it,
it
said
it
really
doesn't...
didn't
matter
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
said
even
if
he
had
made
a
ruling,
unless...
unless
the
jury
had
been
advised,
it
was
ineffective
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
surely
it
can't
mean
that
if
a...
if
a
motion
is
made
at
quarter
after
4:00
in
the
afternoon
and
the
court
customarily
recesses
at
4:30,
that
he
can't
wait
until
the
next
morning,
so
no
testimony
being
taken
in
the
meantime.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
being...
being
revisited
on
appeal
is
different
from
being
revisited
at
the
trial
by
the
trial
judge.
that's...
that's
the
distinction
that's
being
drawn
by
your
opponent
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
are
due
process
problems
that
you're
raising
now,
and
i
suppose
we
could
always
leave
them
to
be
resolved
by
further
proceedings
below,
inquiry
into
whether
there
was
any
prejudice
or
not.
but
that
doesn't
go
to
the
point
that's
before
us
here
which
is
whether
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy,
this...
this
terminates
the
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's...
it's
no
use
arguing,
well,
he
could
have
been
prejudiced.
okay,
he's
prejudiced.
we...
we
can
take
care
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
doesn't
got
to
the
double
jeopardy
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
absolutely.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
only
do
you
not
have
to,
it
does
you
no
good
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
the
federal
rule
is
that
it
attaches
when
there's
been
a
directed
verdict,
but
it's
up
to
state
law
when...
when
there's
been
a
directed
verdict.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there's
nothing
incompatible
there.
