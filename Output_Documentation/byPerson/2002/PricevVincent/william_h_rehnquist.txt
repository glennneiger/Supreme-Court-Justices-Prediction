chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
02-524,
janette
price,
warden
versus
duyonn
andre
vincent.
mr.
busch.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you...
when
you
say
this
was
a
factual
matter,
i
got
the
impression
that
as
to
basic
facts,
there
really
wasn't
any
dispute
about
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
there
was
no...
all
i'm
saying,
there
was
no
doubt
about
what...
what
he
said.
the...
the
legal
import
is...
may
be
much
more
difficult
to
figure
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
busch,
this
case
here
come...
the
case
comes
to
us
under...
under
aedpa;
that
is,
that
you
don't
have
to
show
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
correct
as
a
matter
of
law
in
its
decision.
you
have...
your...
your
opponent
has
to
show
that
either
it
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
our
precedents
or
contrary
to
our
precedents,
if
it's
a
legal
question,
and
if
it's
a
factual
question,
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
made
unreasonable
findings
of
fact.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
not
really
an
answer.
if
it's
just
the
prosecutor's
case
and
the
motion
is
made,
is
that
covered
by
the
rule,
or
is
it
required
that
both
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
case
be
in?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
motion
can
be
made,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
it
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
in
ordinary
trial
practice
certainly
you...
you
can't...
the
defense
counsel
in
a
criminal
case
can't
get
up
after
the
prosecution
has
called
two
witnesses
and
said,
i
move
for...
i...
i
move
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
i
would
think
the
first
time
that
could
be
made
ordinarily
would
be--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--after
the
close
of
the
prosecution's
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
29
of
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may,
mr.
busch.
we'll
hear
from
mr.
lamken.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
it
wouldn't
be
if...
excuse
me.
what...
what
if
you
have
a
series
of
defendants
in
a...
in
a
case
and
it's
being
tried,
and
at
the
close
of
the
prosecution's
evidence,
the
judge
dismisses
the
indictment
as
against
one
of
the
defendants,
but
keeps
on
so
the
jury
is
still
there?
what
happens
then?
can
the...
the
prosecution
come
back
a
couple
days
later
and
say,
you
made
a
mistake?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
say...
change
my
hypothetical
to
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that's
an
extraordinary
doctrine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lamken.
mr.
moran,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in...
in
your
position
here
attacking
a
state
judgment,
you
don't...
you
don't
immediately
get
to
the
constitutional
question.
you
get
to
the
question
of
whether
the
michigan
supreme
court's
ruling
was
either
contrary
to
our
precedents
or
an
unreasonable
application
of
them.
in
other
words,
the
michigan
supreme
court
could
have
been
wrong
as
a
matter
of
abstract
constitutional
law
and
it
could
still
be
upheld
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
in
smalis
there
was
no
doubt
about
what
the
judge
had
done.
i
mean,
there
he
expressly
found
that
the
state
had
not
proved
its
case
and
everybody
agreed
he
had
done
that,
and
then
the
state
appealed
to
the
higher
courts
in
pennsylvania.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
aedpa,
what
is
it
you
think
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
did
wrong?
was
it
to
misapply
our
law,
or
was
it
a
misapplication
of
the
finding
of
fact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
aedpa
doesn't
say
one
way
or
the
other.
aedpa
doesn't
use
the
term,
legal
conclusion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
asking
you
which
one
you...
you
want
to
be
under,
or
perhaps
you
want
to
be
under
both.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
no...
no
evidence...
no...
no
witnesses
testified,
did
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
surely
that...
that
suggests
that
he
has
not
finally
made
up
his
mind.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you...
that's
assuming
the...
assuming
the
whole
factual
point
at
issue
here,
that
there
was
a
partial
directed
verdict.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
in
smalis,
there
was
no
doubt
about
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that...
that
was
a
very
theoretical
thing,
whether
as
a
matter
of...
when
you're
saying
there's
no
evidence
as
a
matter
of
law,
that's
a
factual
ruling
or
a
legal
ruling.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i...
i
don't
think
that
bears
on
our
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
follow
up
on
an
earlier
question
of
justice
breyer's.
do
you
think
that
if
this
is
true
under
the
federal
system
that
it
was
a
directed
verdict,
it
must
therefore
be
true
under
the...
under
an...
under
any
state
system?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
fact
that...
that
that
case
applies
double
jeopardy
to
the
states
i
don't
think
necessarily
settles
whether
a
particular
state
procedure
is
or
is
not
a
directed
verdict.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
moran.
mr.
busch,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
busch.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
02-524,
price
against
vincent.
the
respondent
here
was
tried
in
flint,
michigan
for
what
was
called
open
murder.
meaning
that
he
could
be
convicted
either
of
first-degree
or
second-degree
murder.
but
the
clause
of
the
prosecution's
case
and
outside
the
hearing
of
the
jury,
the
defense
move
for
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
as
to
first-degree
murder.
the
trial
judge
agreed
that
second-degree
murder
would
be
an
appropriate
charge.
the
prosecutor
then
asked
to
make
a
statement
about
first-degree
murder
the
following
morning
and
the
judge
agreed
to
hear
it.
the
following
morning,
when
the
prosecutor
began
the
statement,
the
defense
counsel
objected.
the
defense
argued
that
the
judge
had
already
granted
its
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
as
to
first-degree
murder
and
the
continued
prosecution
of
that
charge
would
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
the
judge
said,
"oh,
i
granted
a
motion
but
i
have
not
directed
a
verdict.
the
judge
allowed
prosecution
on
the
first-degree
murder
charge
to
continue
and
the
jury
ultimately
convicted
the
respondent
on
that
charge.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
saying
that
continued
prosecution
for
first-degree
murder
had
violated
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
term
reversed
the
court
of
appeals.
it
held
that
the
trial
judge's
comments
had
not
been
sufficiently
final
to
terminate
jeopardy.
respondent
then
notified
the
court
of
a
docket
sheet
entry
indicating
that
the
charge
of
open
murder
had
been
amended
to
second-degree
murder,
but
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
declined
to
reconsider
its
ruling.
so,
the
respondent
then
sought
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
federal
court.
pursuant
to
a
statute
called
aedpa
which
congress
passed
in
the
90's,
a
state
prisoner
is
not
entitled
to
federal
habeas
relief
unless
he
can
meet
certain
requirements.
here,
the
parties
do
not
dispute
the
underlying
facts.
thus,
the
respondent
is
not
entitled
to
relief
unless
he
can
demonstrate
that
the
state
court's
decision
of
his
claim
was
either
contrary
to
or
an
unreasonable
application
of,
clearly
established
federal
law.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
resided
this
standard
but
then
failed
to
apply
it.
it
considered
the
double
jeopardy
question
as
an
original
proposition.
this
was
wrong.
the
michigan
supreme
court
did
not
apply
a
legal
test
contrary
to
those
we
have
adopted
or
reached
a
different
outcome
than
we
have
done
on
facts
materially
indistinguishable
from
those
of
this
case.
the
court's
decision,
therefore,
was
not
contrary
to
our
cases.
nor
was
the
michigan
supreme
court's
decision
an
unreasonable
application
of
our
precedents.
the
michigan
supreme
court
identified
the
applicable
cases
from
our
court,
united
states
versus
martin
linen
supply,
smalis
versus
pennsylvania.
it
reaffirmed
the
principles
articulated
in
those
cases,
but
after
evaluating
the
facts
of
the
case,
said
that
the
trial
judge's
comments
simply
were
not
sufficiently
final
to
terminate
jeopardy.
this
was
not
an
objectively
unreasonable
conclusion.
indeed,
many
other
courts
have
refused
to
find
double
jeopardy
violations
under
very
similar
circumstances.
thus,
even
if
we
agreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
should
prevent
continued
prosecution
under
these
circumstances.
it
was
at
least
reasonable
for
the
state
court
to
conclude
otherwise.
because
the
respondent
has
not
met
the
statutory
requirements
for
habeas
relief,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
