mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
a
long-established
background
principle
that
mid-trial
rulings
are
inherently
subject
to
reconsideration
by
the
trial
court
itself
until
the
end
of
trial.
that
is
especially
so
where,
as
here,
a
party
promptly
seeks
reconsideration
which
necessarily
renders
the
initial
ruling
inconclusive.
that
rule
reflects
four
important
legal
and
practical
considerations.
first,
trial
courts
often
must
rule
swiftly
without
the
benefit
of
extended
briefing,
argument,
or
deliberation
or
even
a
copy
of
the
trial
transcript.
they
could
not
operate
justly
absent
the
opportunity
for
reconsideration.
second,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
affords
the
government
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
make
its
case
in
the
first
tribunal.
in
the
context
of
trial,
that
full
and
fair
opportunity
includes
reconsideration.
indeed,
reconsideration
is
particularly
important
precisely
because
the
government
very
often
cannot
appeal.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
the
court
could...
there
are
many
stopping
points
short
of
our
argument
on
which
the
court
could
resolve
this--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
your
honor,
the
court
would
have
discretion
to
reach
the
constitutional
ground
if
it
thought
it
were
important
enough
to
resolve
the
disagreements
in
the
state
courts
and
their...
their
rulings
that
are
contrary
to--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
that
is...
that
is
one
of
the
rules
the
court
follows
and
it's
a
general
rule,
but
in
important
cases,
particularly
in
the
qualified
immunity
context,
for
example,
the
court
will...
will
sometimes
announce
the
constitutional
rule
because
it's
sufficiently
important
to
settle
the
matter
rather
than
resolving
it
on
statutory
grounds
or
in...
in
the
context
of
qualified
immunity
on
reasonableness
grounds.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
justice
scalia,
the
court
would
have
discretion
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue
if
it
chose,
but
it
would...
certainly
would
not
be
required
to
do
so.
for
example,
the
court
decided
a
double
jeopardy
issue
in
monge,
but
that
was
4
years
after
addressing
the
exact
same
issue
in...
on
teague
grounds
in
an
earlier
case.
and
for
those
4
years,
the
lower
federal
courts
and
the
courts
in
the
state
of
california
for
which
it
had
special
applicability
suffered
through
a...
a
tremendous
amount
of
uncertainty.
and
we
would
urge
the
court,
given
the
uncertainty
that's
out
there,
to
reach
the
constitutional
question.
however,
the
court
would
have
discretion
to
resolve
this
on
2254
grounds--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
but
not
for
due
process
purposes.
that
would
raise
a...
raise
a...
a
serious
due...
excuse
me...
due
process
issue.
it's
the
exact
same
issue
that
arises,
for
example,
when
a
trial
court
dismisses
a
count
of
a
complaint,
which
raises
no
double
jeopardy
concerns
at
all
and
then,
very
late
in
the
trial,
determines
that
he
had
erred
in
dismissing
an...
a
count
of
the
indictment.
when
that
happens,
the
ordinary
process
is
either
the
court
must
reopen
the
evidence
to
permit
the
defendant
to
put
on
the
defense
that
he
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
present,
or
the
defendant
may
be
entitled
to
a
mistrial.
but
that
is
very
much
a
fairness
trial,
due
process
issue,
not
a
question
of
double
jeopardy.
the
third
point
is
that
double
jeopardy--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--in
our
view
that's
precisely
correct,
so
long
as
judge
wyzanski
had
not
discharged
the
jury
because
once
you
discharge
the
jury,
the...
the
defendant's
right
to
trial
before
his
tribunal
of
choice
has
been
eliminated.
the...
so
long
as
the
jury
hasn't
been
discharged,
the
trial
court
has
inherent
authority
to
correct
its
own
mistakes.
no
double
jeopardy
purpose
is
served
by
giving...
by
precluding
reconsideration
to
give
the
defendant
the
benefit
of
acquittal
to
which
no
court,
and
certainly
not
the
jury
and
not
the
trial
court
that
putatively
granted
it,
believes
the
defendant
is
entitled.
particularly--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i'd
say--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
i
think
it
would...
our
best
case
would
probably
be
this
court's
statements
in
arizona
versus
washington,
in
essence
that
the
government...
although
the
government
often
doesn't
get
an
appeal
and
it
doesn't
get
a
second
shot
at...
bite
of
the
apple,
it
does
get
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
before
the
trial
court.
in
our
view
that
full
and
fair
opportunity
must
include
reconsideration
precisely
because
trial
courts
move
so
swiftly
and
because
the
initial
decision
by
a
trial
court
isn't
meant
to
be
a
final
decision
but
is,
in
fact,
part
of
the
deliberative
process,
part
of
the
ongoing
dialogue
in
trial
among
the
judge,
among
a
prosecutor
and
defendant's
counsel.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no.
we
think
it's--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no.
the
ordinary
rule...
and
this
is
the
same
rule
that
applies
where
a
court,
for
example,
dismisses
a
count
of
the
indictment...
is
that
defendants
are
entitled
to
rely
on
the
interlocutory
rulings.
if
they
do
so
to
their
detriment
and
to
their
prejudice
and
it
denies
them
the
opportunity
to
present
their
fair
defense,
that
is
a
significant
due
process
problem
and
may
entitle--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's,
actually
points
up
a
difficult
question
which
is
whether
or
not
the
dismissal
of
the...
well,
if
it's
dismissal
in
the
indictment,
it
certainly
isn't
a
double
jeopardy
problem,
but
if
it's
a
judgment
of
acquittal
at
that
point,
the
question
the
court
would
have
to
confront--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
that's
what
i
assumed
you
had
meant.
and
if
that
were
the
case,
the
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
that
there...
there's
constructively
or
through
legal
fiction
the
discharge
of
the
jury
with
respect
to
that
defendant
even
though
the
actual
jury
is
still
there--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--we
believe
the
actual
answer
would
be--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
i...
i
would
believe
that
the
proper
answer
would
be
that
if
the
jury
is
still
available,
the
prosecution
can
seek
reconsideration.
but
one
could
say
that
the
jury
was
constructively
discharged
with
respect
to
that
defendant
and
thereby
preclude
the
prosecution
from
seeking
reconsideration.
but
the
critical
moment
in
all
of
those
cases
is
what
constitutes
discharge
of
the
jury,
the
defendant's
chosen
trier
of
fact.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
the
constitution--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
certainly
the
constitution
doesn't
require
there
to
be
mid-trial
rulings
on
judgments
for
acquittal.
in
fact,
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
29(b)
specifically
allows--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
and
if
the
defendant
relies
to
his
detriment
and
it
prevents
him
from
presenting
a
fair
defense
to
which
due
process
entitles
him,
we
believe
that
he
might
be
entitled
to
a
mistrial.
but
we...
nothing
of
that
sort
happened
here
because
defendant
not
only
was
on
notice
that
this...
that
the
ruling
was
subject
to
change,
but
if
you
look
at
the
point
in
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
the
penultimate
page,
where
the
court
announced...
page
46,
where
the
court
announces
that
it
has
decided
to
reconsider,
there's
no
objection
from
the
defense
saying,
wait
a
minute,
we
relied.
our
whole
defense
rested
on
this
ruling.
there's
no
statement
to
that
effect.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that...
that--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
i...
i
think
that
just
points
out
the
general
rule,
that...
when
a
trial
court
issues
a
mid-trial
ruling,
the
defendant
generally
has
a
right
to...
to
rely
on
it,
and
if
he
relies
on
it
and
it
denies
him
his
opportunity
to
present
a
fair
defense,
that
presents
a
serious
due
process
problem.
but
it
is
not
a
double
jeopardy
problem
because
double
jeopardy
is
concerned
with
having
two
trials
against
the
defendant
when
the
prosecution
had
its
full
and
fair
opportunity
in
the
first.
the
final
problem
with
the
contrary
rule
is
that
it
requires
appellate
courts
to
engage
in
an
often
unrealistic
endeavor
to
go
through
and
try
and
determine
what
the
trial
court,
through
its
spontaneous
and
sometimes
extemporaneous
statements,
really
meant
to
do
or
what
it
actually
did.
for
example,
in
this
case
it
seems
to
come
down
to
the
question
of
whether
the
words,
my
impression
at
this
time,
is...
suggest
sufficient
tentativeness
and
whether
the
word
okay
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
it
is
so
ordered.
in
addition,
under
respondent's
approach,
the
trial...
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
required
to
determine
whether
the
request
for
reconsideration
came
promptly
enough,
whether
or
not
it
came
in
the
same
breath...
i
see
i'm
out
of
time.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
