justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
your
best
authority
for
that
proposition
from
this
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or...
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--or
does
that
take
us
somewhat
further
than
we've
gone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
you
drop
the
first
degree
murder
charge...
or
the
judge
orders
it
dismissed
and
then
the
defendant
testifies
thinking,
well,
at
least
i'm
not
going
to
be
tried
for
first
degree,
in
your
view
the
trial
judge
can
change
its
ruling
and
reinstate
the
first
degree
murder
charges
because
the
defendant
shouldn't
have
relied?
he--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the...
the
defendant
should
know
that
the
judge
can
change
his
mind,
and
so
he
better
not
take
the
stand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
getting
back
to
the
earlier
point,
if
a...
if
the
defendant
testifies,
thinking
there's
going
to
be
no
first
degree
charge,
and
it's
later
reinstated,
under
your
position
i
think
you
would
say,
he
shouldn't
have
relied.
the
rule
is
that
he
knows
the
judge
can
change
his
mind.
therefore,
his
reliance
was
at
his
peril.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
argue...
that's
the
consequence
of
your
argument
it
seems.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
hypothetical
is
there
is
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
that
called
to
their
attention
in
rehearing,
though?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
explain
their
failure
to
grant
rehearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
a
discretionary
matter,
i
wouldn't
think,
in
a
criminal
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
when
there
was
an
error
of
law
called
to
their
attention.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
assume
it
would
have
been
an
acquittal
as
a
matter
of
michigan
law
because
of
the...
the
docket
entry.
would
it
necessarily
follow
that
it
was
also
an
acquittal
for
purposes
of
federal
law?
