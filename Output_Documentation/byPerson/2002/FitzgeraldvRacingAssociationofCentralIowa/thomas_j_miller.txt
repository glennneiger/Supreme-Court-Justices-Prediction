mr.
thomas
j.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
iowa
legislature,
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause,
can
charge
different
tax
rates
for
its
riverboats
and
its
racetracks
for
a
number
of
legitimate
state
interest
reasons,
including
and
especially
the
one
highlighted
by
the
district
court
judge
here,
the
promotion
of
the
development
of
river
communities.
in
1983,
iowa
broke
ground
and
got
more
friendly
with
gambling
and
allowed
horse
racing
and
dog
racing
in
our
state.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
i...
is
there
a
neutral
term,
your
honor?
in...
in
regard
to
gaming,
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
having
horse
and
dog
racing
was
to
develop
a
new
subset
of
our
agricultural
economy,
the
breeding,
training,
and
raising
of
horses
and
dogs.
and
that
succeeded.
it
turned
out
to
be
about
a
$50
million
industry.
six
years
later,
with
visions
of
mark
twain
in
the
background
and
the
two
incredible
rivers
in
america
surrounding
our
state,
the
mississippi
and
the
missouri,
the
legislature
authorized
riverboat
casinos,
riverboat
gambling.
and
one
of
the
main
purposes
there
was
tourism,
economic
development
for
the
river
communities
and
riverfront
development.
in
a
very
short
time,
there
were
$17
million
worth
of
investment
along
the
various
riverfronts.
a
few
years
later,
though,
neither
gaming
enterprise
was...
was
doing
as
well
as
they
would
like,
indeed,
not
doing...
not
doing
well
at
all.
in
regard
to
the
riverboats,
the
problem
was,
well,
iowa
had
this
sort
of,
in
a
way,
naivete
maybe
about
betting.
they
restricted
the
amount
of
bets
on
riverboats.
it
could
only
be
a
$5
bet
and
one
couldn't
lose
more
than...
more
than
$200
in
one
setting.
well,
illinois
had
a
different
view
and
had
no
limits
and
were
starting
to
succeed
competitively.
the...
the
situation
with
the
racetracks
was
more
severe,
that
economically
it
just
wouldn't
work
to
have
racing,
either
horse
racing
or
dog
racing
alone.
so
iowa
became
the
first
state
in
the
nation
to
allow
the
sort
of
the...
the
golden
goose
of
gambling,
slot
machines,
at
racetracks.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
that...
that's
right,
your
honor.
indeed,
really
the
slot
machines
support
the...
support
the
racing.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
that...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
was
provided
on
a...
on
a
graduated
basis.
actually
in
next
year
it's...
the
36
percent
would
be...
would
be
reached.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
yes.
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
and
what...
what
we
say
is
that
the
development
of
the...
of
the
riverboats
could
be
rationally
preferred
by
the...
by
the
legislature
because
of
riverboat
development,
because
of
economic
development
on
the...
on
the
rivers.
additionally,
the...
the
district
court
found
that
the
additional
rational
basis
could
be
sort
of
supporting
the
riverboat
enterprises
as
a...
as
an
industry,
promoting
riverboat
history.
also,
we
argue
that
there
was
a
problem
of
riverboats
leaving
the
state,
that
three
out
of
six
in
the
previous...
previous
to
1994,
the
legislation
year,
had...
had
left
the
state.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
well,
that
was
the
next
purpose,
your
honor,
to
try
and
get
other
boats
to...
to
come
to
iowa,
and
apparently--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--well,
i
think
there's
been
many
times
where
the...
the
taxpayer
has
been...
been
treated
differently
even
if...
even
if
the
transaction
is
the
same.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
sort
of
the...
the
enterprise
zones,
for
instance.
communities
are...
are
given
favorable
tax
rates
all
the
time
for
economic
development
purposes
and
that's
what's
here.
and--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--yes.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that...
that
would...
that
would
be
another
example.
and,
you
know,
the
state
has
great
latitude
in
the
taxation
area
and
justifiably
so
because
there
are
so
many
complexities
that...
that
that
be
available
to
the
state.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
i...
i
think
as
far
as
i
know,
that's...
that's
the...
that's
the
case.
slot
machines
typically
are
not
in
multiple
purposes...
not
multiple
places
like
iowa.
typically
they're
in...
they're
in
casinos.
so
there's
not...
not
a
lot
of
apt
comparisons.
but
you
know,
this
is...
this
is
a...
a
question
for
the
legislature.
when
there's
no
suspect
category
or
fundamental
right
available,
the
legislature
has...
has
a
great
deal
of...
of
discretion.
and
the
enterprise...
the
purpose
of
the
enterprise
is
different.
the
economic
development
as
opposed
to
the
agricultural,
for
instance.
when
that...
when
that
is
the
case,
the...
the
legislature
really
has...
has
a
great
deal--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--well,
there
is
difference--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--there
is
difference
in...
in
the
enterprise.
one
has
slot
machines
and
table
games.
the
other
has
slot
machines
and...
and
racing.
but
here
you
have
a...
a
series
of
communities
in...
in
eastern
iowa
and
then
in
western
iowa
along
the
rivers
that
had
suffered
loss
of
manufacturing
jobs.
this
was...
this
was
an
effort,
a
legitimate
effort,
on
the
part
of
the
legislature
to
advance
a
new
industry,
a
tourism
industry,
on
the
two
rivers.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
it
was...
it
was
phased
in,
your
honor.
that--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--well,
the
legislature,
of
course,
had
the...
had
the
discretion
to...
to
have
them
both
at
36
percent.
the...
the
benefit
of
the...
to
the...
to
the
riverboats
was
that...
that
they
didn't
go
to
the
higher
rate
that...
that
the...
that
they
did
for
the...
for
the
racetracks.
it's
sort
of
a
chicken
and
egg
problem,
but...
but
they're
spared
that...
that
higher
rate
and...
and
that's...
and
that's
an
appropriate
benefit.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
that's
it.
the--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--that's
right,
your
honor.
there's
a...
there's
a
very
favorable
rate
for
the...
for
the
racing
at
the...
at
the
racetrack.
so
it's
a...
in
a
sense
it's
a...
it's
a
blend
of
rates
between
the
two.
again,
understandably
so--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not.
it's...
it's
the
same.
it's
the
same
rate.
so
you
have...
you
sort
of
have
20
percent
there
as
opposed
to,
say,
as
was
just
pointed
out,
4
or
5
percent
for
the
racing
at
the...
at
the
racetrack.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
it
would
be...
it
would
be
more
easily
to...
to
calculate
and
more
efficient.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
they
are
scattered
throughout
the
state.
two
of
them
are
on
the...
turned
out
to
be
on
the
rivers.
but
the
largest
one,
the
premier
one,
prairie
meadows,
is
in
the
des
moines
area
in...
in
central
iowa.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
well,
i
mean,
shocking
that...
that
a
legislator
on...
on...
in
riverboat
country
would
try
and
help
the...
help
the
riverboats.
i
mean,
that's,
for
better
or
worse,
part
of
the...
part
of
the
legislative
process,
always
was
and
always
will
be.
and...
and
courts
can't
be
sort
of
cops
to...
to
make
sure
that...
that
they...
that
they
do
not
do
that.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
yes.
well,
it's,
you
know,
the
old
adage
about
sausage,
making
sausage,
that
you
shouldn't
watch
it,
that--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--yes.
the...
you
know,
the...
the
legislature...
the
court
could
have
said
that
they
were
diverging
from...
from
the
standards
of
this
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
well,
our
argument
is...
is,
your
honor...
and
we
know
we're...
we're
into
sort
of
a
little
bit
new
territory
here.
but
our
argument
is
that...
that
the
court
has
made
a
decision
that
the...
the
analysis...
a
clear
decision
that
the
analysis
is
the
same
under
the
federal
and
the
state
constitutional
provision.
if
that
analysis,
judged
by
a
higher
court,
is
determined
to
be
wrong,
then
that
would...
would
seem
perhaps
to
settle
it.
but
more
significantly,
the...
the
respondents
didn't
argue
below
that
there
was
a
separate
analysis,
that...
that
they
should
look
at
it
separately.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
yes.
it's...
it
might
not,
but
we
argue
that...
that
they
sort
of
waived
that
argument,
that
they
didn't
argue
that
in...
in
the
first
time
through,
that
they...
it
was
a
different
analysis.
they
conceded,
like
everybody
else,
and
assumed
that
it
was
the
same
analysis.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
i
understand,
mr.
chief
justice.
maybe
i'm
making
my
argument
too
soon
and...
and
will--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--well,
we...
we
will...
we
will
try
i...
i
assume.
what...
what
we're
saying
here
is
that...
that
there
are
multiple
legitimate
state
purposes
available
that
are
well
within
the
zone
of
nordlinger
and
the
related
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court,
that...
that
this
is
comfortably
a
legitimate
state
interest,
a
number
of
them,
most
specifically
the
development
of
the...
of...
of
the
river
communities.
and
that's...
that's
consistent--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--well,
i...
i
don't
think
that
there's...
there
would
be
sufficient
legislative
history
to
foreclose
rational
speculation.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
i...
i
think
that
that
kind
of...
kind
of
history
would
not,
in
a
rational
speculation
case,
that...
that--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--well,
i...
i
suppose
not.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
i
wanted
to
be
thoughtful,
your
honor.
but
like...
we
get
back
to...
to
the...
the
rough
and
tumble
of
the
legislative
process
as...
as
you
suggest,
your
honor,
is
such
that
the
courts
don't...
don't
review
that,
don't...
don't--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--that's...
that's
pretty
much...
pretty
much
what's...
what's
being
said
here
and...
and
how
the
cases
have
been
interpreted.
and
is...
and
it
makes...
makes
a
lot
of
sense
because
like
you...
like
you
suggest,
your
honor,
when
there's...
there's
not
a
fundamental
right
or
a
suspect
category,
that's
the
pure
legislative
authority
and
that's
where
democracy
kicks
in
our...
in
our
country,
for
better
or
for
worse,
and
the
assumption
is
that
if
they
make
a
mistake,
democracy
later
will...
will
catch
that
mistake.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to...
to
now
turn
it
over
to...
this
has
been
my
first
argument,
so
i
refer
to
him
as
my
safety
net.
[laughter]
kent
jones
from
the
solicitor
general's
office,
and
reserve
what
time
is
remaining
after
he
is
done.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
i
would
just
point
out
that
minnesota
v.
clover
leaf
creamery
company
is
the...
is
the
case
where
this
court
decided
that
in...
in
a
case
before
this
court
that
comes
from
a
state
court,
that
the
federal
process,
the
federal
analysis
applies,
and
that
the
total
work,
the
total
decisionmaking
done
by
the
state
court
is
reviewable
here,
so
much
so
that
in
that
case
they
reversed
a
factual
finding
in...
in
the
court.
i
would
emphasize
too
that...
that
the
iowa
supreme
court
has
said
that...
that
the
analysis
is...
is...
always
is
the
same
between
the
state
provision
and...
and
the
federal
provision,
and
it's
only
departed,
as
a
matter
of
result,
only
one
time,
the
bierkamp
case,
in
the
130
years
that
the
two
provisions
existed
at
the
same
time.
with
that,
i
would
respond
to
any
questions
that
you
might
have
or...
or
conclude
by
asking
you
to
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
this...
of
this
act
because
there
are
multiple
legitimate
state
interests
developed
by
rational
speculation
to
support
the
legislation.
thank
you.
