mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'd
like
to
thank
counsel.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
taxing
decisions
are
like
spending
decisions
because
they
affect
the
state's
economy,
as
well
as
its
balance
sheet.
in
recognizing
that
fact,
this
court
has
consistently
upheld
the...
the...
has
consistently
held
that
a
state's
desire
to
promote
or
foster
one
type
of
business
over
another
or
even
to
promote
or
foster
one
mode
of
doing
a
business
over
another
is
a
rational
basis
that
supports
taxing
the
one
and
exempting
the
other.
for
example,
in
state
board
v.
jackson
in
1931,
this
court
held...
upheld
a
tax
differential,
a
different
tax
treatment,
of
chain
stores
versus
single
enterprise
retail
stores.
even
though
these
businesses
did
essentially
the
same
commerce,
the
court
held
that
in
the
state's
exercise
of
its
broad
authority
to
govern
the
economy
of
the
state,
it
can
prefer
one
mode
of
doing
the
same
business
over
another.
and
that
same
rationale
has
been
applied
by
this
court
in
numerous
contexts
involving
tax
distinctions
between,
for
example,
warehouses
located
near
railroads
and
warehouses
not
located
near
railroads,
between
laundries
that
are
operated
by
hand
and
laundries
that
are
operated
by
machine,
and
even
between
individuals
and
corporations
that
are
conducting
identical
businesses.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
assuming
that
we're
still
talking
about
state
laws--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--assuming
we're
still
talking
about
state
laws,
i
would
have
to
ask
myself
what
would
be
the
rational
basis.
the
rational
basis--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
that
might
explain...
the
difference
i
think
between
your
hypothetical
and...
and
where
i'm
trying
to
come
from
is
that
the
rational
basis
has
to
be
related
to
a
legitimate
state
purpose.
there's
a...
a
legitimate
state
purpose
in
fostering
certain
kinds
of
commerce
and
suppressing
others.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's...
it's
hypothetically
conceivable
and
that's
the
question
that
this
court
asked
itself
under...
under
fcc
v.
beach.
is
there
a
conceivable
state
interest
that
would
justify
that
distinction?
and
obviously,
that...
the
fact
that
there
has
to
be
one
doesn't
mean
there
always
is
one,
and
i'm
not
standing
here
saying,
well,
every
imaginable
distinction
is
justifiable.
the
distinction
in
this
case
is
simply
between...
is
whether
the
state
could
conceivably
have
preferred
riverboats
over
racetracks.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the...
there's
a
case
that
justice
ginsburg
could
tell
us
about.
she
argued
a
case
where
this
court...
i
think
it
was
called
weinberger
v.
wiesenfeld,
a
case...
not
a
tax
case.
it
was
a
social
security
benefits
case,
and
the
court
held
that
the
distinct
treatment
of...
of
the
surviving
spouse's
ability--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
it...
it
was
described
by
the
court
as...
as
a
rational
scrutiny
case,
and
it
said
there
was
no
legitimate
state
interest
because
in...
in
the
context
between
treating
differently
male
and
female
surviving
spouses,
in
light
of
the
objective
of
that
statute,
which
was
to
protect
the...
the
children
of
the
couple,
there
was
no
rational
basis
to
prefer
one
rather
than
the
other.
that
is...
that
is
the
only
case
that
i
can
cite
to
you
where
this
court
has
applied
a
rational
basis
test
to
strike
down
a
federal
statute.
there
may
well
be
others.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i...
i
can't
think
of
one,
but
it's
not
because
there
is
no
rational
basis
test.
it's
because
in
applying
this
test,
the
court
is
very
deferential
in
recognizing
that
states
have
intentionally
been
given
this
authority
over
regulating
state
commerce,
and
that
these
kinds
of
choices
are
left
to
the
legislative
branch.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i...
we
understand
that
to
have
been
a
case
where
the...
which
you
also
argued
i
believe,
unless
i'm
remembering
the
wrong
case--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--ah.
[laughter]
i
made
another
mistake
in
the
brief
that
i'll
get
to
later
if
i
have
a
chance.
but
that
was--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
afraid--
[laughter]
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but...
but
the...
it
was...
it
was
a
tax
case.
but
in
that
case,
the
court...
you
were...
the
court
was
persuaded
that
the
distinction
was
invidious.
the
court
didn't
say
that
a
different
treatment
of
unmarried
men
and
unmarried
women
in
this
particular
deduction
context
was
irrational.
the
court
said
it
was
invidious.
so
i
believe
that
the
only
tax...
federal
tax
case
that
has...
well,
i
don't
believe
there
is
a
federal
tax
case
that
this
court
has
decided
that
violated...
failed
to
meet
the
rational
basis
test.
the...
the
court
below
made...
the
iowa
supreme
court...
where
it
went
wrong
was
looking
to
only
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
there
were
many
purposes.
they
looked
to
just
the
purpose
of
whether
it
aided
racetracks,
which
just
kind
of
strikes
me
as
an
unrealistic
way
to
look
at
what
the
purpose
of
a
legislation
that
imposes
a
tax
on
racetracks
would
be.
but
to
answer
a
question
that
justice
stevens
raised
earlier,
when...
in
applying
the
rational
basis
test,
the
courts
are
to
look
to
any
plausible
or
conceivable
theory.
and...
and
in
fcc
v.
beach,
as
well
as
other
cases
we've
cited,
in
applying
that
test,
the
court
has
said
that
you
don't
look...
you're
not
bound
by
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
and
indeed,
you're
not
supposed
to
make
fact
findings
as
to
what
these
legitimate
interests
might
be.
instead,
you're
supposed
to
allow
the
state
any
rational
legitimate
interest
that
the
court
might...
might
be
able
to
perceive
and...
and
nail
down
that
point
in
that
case
by
saying
that...
and
i'm
quoting...
it
is
entirely
irrelevant
whether
the
conceived
state
purpose
actually
motivated
the
state's
decision.
so
you
don't
have...
the
state
doesn't
have
to
show
that
these
rational,
legitimate
state
interests,
in
fact,
motivated
the
decision.
it
doesn't
have
to
show
that
they
are,
in
fact,
the
basis
for
the
decision
because
this
is
a
federal
constitutional
question.
this
is
not
a
question
of
interpreting
the
state
law.
if
we
wanted
to
interpret
the
state
law,
we'd
want
to
know
what
its
purpose
was,
but
that's
not
this
task.
in
looking
at
the
constitutional
limitation,
it
only...
it
only
takes
effect
if
the
state
has
no
conceivable
or
plausible
legitimate
interest
in
the
classification.
one
other
point
to
mention
briefly
is
they
say
allegheny
pittsburgh
points
another
direction.
allegheny
pittsburgh
was
the
rare
case
that
this
court
said
in
nordlinger...
was
the
rare
case
where
there
was
a
west
virginia
state
constitutional
provision
that
said
all
assessment...
all
property
taxes
will
be
levied
based
on
market
value.
a
local
assessor
in
that
state
didn't
like
that
and
he...
he
assessed
taxes
based
on
acquisition,
which
is
prices,
which
is
the
last
sale
price
of
each
property,
and
that
resulted
in...
in
a
differential
treatment
of
each
taxpayer.
and
what
this
court
held
in...
in
allegheny
pittsburgh
was
that
because
the
state
constitution
prohibited
any
taxation
other
than
market
value,
there
was
no
legitimate
state
interest
to
justify
the...
the
distinguishing
tax
rates.
well,
that
case
doesn't
have
any
application
here
because
there's
no
provision
in
the
iowa
constitution
that
says
that
the
iowa
legislature
cannot,
in
regulating
commerce,
prefer
or
promote
riverboat
traffic
and
riverboat--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it...
well,
in
nordlinger,
the
court...
if
i
understand
your
question
right,
in
nordlinger,
the
court
upheld
an
acquisition...
last
sale
price
tax
scheme
i
think
in
california
where
there
was
no
constitutional
provision
in
california
that
required
market
value
taxation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
you
would
make...
i
think
in
that...
in
looking
for
a
legitimate
state
interest,
you
would
make
an
inquiry
into
whether
the
iowa
constitution
prohibited
preferring
riverboats...
preferring
riverboat
commerce
because
a
legitimate
state
interest
for
federal
purposes...
and
the
court
made
this
very
point
in
response
to
a
dissent
of
yours
in...
in
the
opinion
by
justice
brennan
in
the
minnesota
v.
the
clover
leaf
creamery
case.
