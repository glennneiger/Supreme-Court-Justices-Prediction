unknown
speaker
it's
called
gaming
if...
if
you
favor
it.
unknown
speaker
so
now
the
bulk
of
the
earnings
are
from
slot
machines
rather
than
the
races.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
under
your
scheme,
i
take
it
the
highest
tax
rate
for
slot
machine
income
at
racetracks
is
36
percent
versus
20
percent
for
slot
machines
on
riverboats.
unknown
speaker
and
you
want
to
offer
a
rational
basis
for
that
scheme?
unknown
speaker
well,
because
of
that
legislation,
the
delta
king
left
the
sacramento
river
and
it's
gone
up
to
the
mississippi.
unknown
speaker
they're...
they're
saying...
and
maybe
there's...
i
take
it
from
their
brief
that,
look,
there's
never
been
a
tax
scheme
like
this.
obviously,
a
state
very
often
would...
would
tax
at
a
different
rate
a
handsaw
and
a
screwdriver,
but
we've
never
heard
of
a
state
that
said
when
you
sell
a
screwdriver,
you
pay
5
percent
tax
if
you
sell
it
in
des
moines
and
a
3
percent
tax
if
you
sell
it
in
dubuque,
and
if
it's
sold
by
one
kind
of
a
person,
they
sell
8
percent
tax,
and
it's
all
the
same
screwdriver.
so
they're
saying
there's
never
been
a...
really
a
tax
system
like
this
anywhere,
and...
and
they
better
have
some
pretty
good
reason
or...
or
something.
i
mean,
now...
so
is
all
that
true,
that
there
never
has
been
a
system
like
that,
saying
the
same
screwdriver,
everything
identical,
all
it
is
is
it's
sold
in
different
parts
of
the
state
or
by
different
people,
and...
and
you
have
to
pay
a
different
tax?
unknown
speaker
like
what?
unknown
speaker
typical...
typical
sales
tax.
you
know,
the
state
may
tax
a
barber's
income
at
a
different
rate
than
a
hairdresser's
and
yet
they
may
use
the
same
stuff.
unknown
speaker
do...
do
you
agree,
at
least
to
the
extent
the
respondents
say,
that
there's
no
other
state
in
which
slot
machines
are
taxed
at
a
different
rate
depending
on
their
location,
that
this
is
unique
to
iowa?
unknown
speaker
so
i
push
their
argument
or
am
i
imagining...
i'm
trying
to
put
it
the
strongest
way.
look,
cosmetologists
and
barbers
do
different
things,
and
moreover
an
enterprise
zone
is
a
special
part
of
the
state
that's
not
exactly
the
same.
something
different
is
going
on
there.
here
it's
slot
machine
income.
nothing
different
is
going
on.
nothing.
unknown
speaker
i...
i...
yes,
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understood
it,
didn't...
didn't
the
tax
on
the...
the
higher
tax
on
the
racetracks
come
later?
unknown
speaker
and
i
can't
quite
understand
how
imposing
an
extraordinarily
high
tax
on
racetracks
is
suddenly
going
to
provide
a
benefit
for
riverboats.
unknown
speaker
it's
across-the-board
rate
for
everything
that
goes
on
at
the
riverboat,
right?
it's
a
20
percent
rate,
whether
its
roulette
or
card
games
or
dice,
it's
all
20
percent.
unknown
speaker
for
the
race,
there's
a
great
disparity
between
the
parimutuels.
it's
only
what,
about
5,
6
percent?
unknown
speaker
is
the
rate...
is
the
rate
for
taxing
other
gaming
activities
on
the
riverboats
different
from
the
slot
machines
on
the
riverboats?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
administratively
easier
to
calculate
if
you
have
all
one
rate
for
the
riverboat?
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
riverboats,
obviously,
are
located
on
the
rivers
which
bound
iowa
on
the
east
and
on
the
west.
how
about
the
racetracks?
are
they
scattered
throughout
the
state?
unknown
speaker
add
that
if
we
looked
into
this
at
any
depth
at
all,
we'd
discover
this
originated
from
a
legislator
who
hated
racetracks
and
loved
riverboats
and
was
trying
to
kill
the
whole
thing.
and
then
they
say
that
besides
that,
there
was
a
report
of
a
committee
that
said
all
this
enterprise
zone...
we
don't
think
that's
so,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
unknown
speaker
well,
under--
--if
we
ever
look
to
the
real
reasons
for
things,
it
would
be
a
disaster,
wouldn't
it?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
the
iowa...
the
iowa
supreme
court
seems
to
think
it
could
look
to
what
was
the
real
purpose,
not
the
purpose
that
we
could
conceive.
lots
of
nice
purposes
like
the
riverboat
drifts
away
and
the
racetrack
is--
but
you
said
something
in
your
reply
brief
that...
that
really
surprised
me.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
say...
if
you're
talking
about
federal
equal
protection,
this
is
an
area
in
which
the
leeway
for
the
legislature
is
the
widest
that
there
is.
but
couldn't
iowa
then
say,
okay,
we're
just
doing
this
under
iowa
equal
protection,
and
we
can
make
that
whatever
we
want?
and
for
us,
the
real
purpose
counts,
not
the
conceivable
purpose.
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
they
couldn't
do
that
on
remand.
on
page
6
of
your
reply
brief,
you
said
that
the
iowa
supreme
court
cannot
reconsider
the
state
court
decision
in
order
to
subsequently
establish
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground.
why
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
they
could.
i
mean,
nothing
would
foreclose
them
on
remand
or
the
iowa
supreme
court
itself.
unknown
speaker
all
our
opinion
would
say,
if
we
reverse
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
was
remand
it
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
and
so
certainly,
so
far
as
our
remand
order
is
concerned,
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
is
free
to
do
whatever
it
wants
so
long
as
not...
as
it's
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
unknown
speaker
i
doubt
if
you'll
have
any
better
luck
with
it
before
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
analysis...
i
don't
know
if
this
is
true
or
not...
but
if
the
legislative
history,
if
you
had
a
complete
record
of
all
the
debates
and
everything
else,
and
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
hypothetical
reasons
you
advance
were
definitely
not
the
reasons
that
motivated
the
particular
tax
rates,
that
they
did
it
just,
say,
to
get
even
with
the
racetracks
because
somebody
was
unhappy
with
something
they
had
done
in
the
past
or
something
like
that,
would
that
make
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
take
his
hypothetical.
there
is.
i'm
assuming
that
there
is,
that...
that
there's
a
reason
out
there
that...
that...
none
of
the
reasons
that
you
advance
were,
in
fact,
considered
by
any
of
the
legislators.
in
fact,
they
rejected
them.
they
thought,
we
really
don't
want
to
help
the
riverboats.
what
we
want
to
do
is
do
something
to
really
penalize
the
racetracks
because
they're
an
immoral
business,
they're
even
worse
than
gambling
on
the
rivers.
and
that's
why
they're
doing
it.
and
they
put
that
right
in
the
preamble
to
the
act.
would
that
make
any
difference
in
your
analysis?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
my
question
is,
is
it
rational
speculation
when
you
know
it's
not
true?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
usually
not
true.
i
mean,
usually
these
things
are
done
for
the
self-interest
of...
of
legislators
from
various
districts,
and...
and
as
long
as
there
could
be
a
rational...
i...
i
would
have...
i'm
surprised
it
took
you
so
long
to
answer
that
question.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
isn't...
isn't
that
exactly
really
the
point?
the
courts
just
don't
review
it.
and
unless
you
get
to...
to
some
fact
pattern
that...
that
gets
you
a...
a
higher
level
of
scrutiny,
it's
not
so
much
that
we're
engaging
in
rational
basis
scrutiny.
we're
just
saying
we
can't
touch
the
political
process
unless
you
get
yourself
into
a
suspect
class.
isn't
that
really
what
we're
saying?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
general
miller.
mr.
jones.
unknown
speaker
what
about...
what
about
slot
machines
owned
by
republicans
versus
slot
machines
owned
by
democrats?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
no,
that's
exactly...
i'm
serious
about--
unknown
speaker
--the
rational
basis
is
the
republicans
have
a
majority
in
the
state
legislature.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
about...
what
about
slot
machines
owned
by
farmers
and
slot
machines
owned
by
city
dwellers?
unknown
speaker
what...
what
have
we
held
wasn't
justified
outside
of
a
suspect
category
situation,
such
as...
i
don't
mean
republicans
and
democrats.
you're
into
first
amendment
suspect
categories
i
suppose.
what...
what
have
we
ever
held
was...
was
irrational
that
didn't
involve
race
or...
or,
you
know,
political
discrimination
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
suspect
category,
and
i
mean,
we're
into
sex
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
there
are
others,
but
it's...
it's
the...
it's
quite
interesting,
is...
is
there
a...
there
are
two
sets
where
they're
struck
down.
one
is
what
you
might
call
the
heightened
rational
basis
which
are
normally
not
economic
regulation,
but
there
was
the
mental...
the
mental...
the
building,
you
know,
the...
of
the
home
for
the
mentally
disturbed
or
whatever.
and
then
there
are
the
ones
that
are
out-of-state,
which
are
dormant
commerce
clause
cases.
but
is
there
any
which
is
a
pure
rational
basis
in
an
economic
area?
you
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
and
i
can't
think
of
one.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
when
you
talked
about
federal
tax,
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
the
one
that
you
have
in
your
brief,
martz
against
commissioner.
unknown
speaker
that
was...
that
was...
you
left
out
that
cert
was
denied.
unknown
speaker
these
are
all
cases
she
won
or
lost?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't...
you
didn't
make
the
mistake
of
citing
one
that
she
lost,
did
you?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
there
are
no
such
cases.
[laughter]
oh,
yes,
there
is
and
it
was
a
tax
case.
it
was
a
state
tax
case.
unknown
speaker
do
you
read
allegheny
as
saying
that
the...
if
the
state
had
enacted
exactly
the
scheme
that
was
being
administered
there,
that
it
would
pass
equal
protection
review?
unknown
speaker
would
the
answer
in
this
case
be
different
if
the
iowa
supreme
court
told
us
that
the
iowa
constitution
requires
that
all
slot
machines
be
taxed
alike?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
mccormick.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the...
our
decision
in
fcc
v.
beach,
which
was
just
referred
to
earlier,
where
it
says
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
the
actual
facts
were?
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
said
that
any
conceivable
rational
basis
is
enough.
we
don't
care
what
iowa
really
had
in
mind.
unknown
speaker
if
you
think
gender
discrimination
cases
aren't
different,
you're
just
wrong.
unknown
speaker
some
legislatures...
some
legislatures
don't
have
legislative
history.
what
is
to
be
done
in
those
cases?
what,
do
you...
you
convene
a
trial
court
to
take
testimony
from
legislators
and
others
to
find
out
what
was
the
actual
intent
of
the
legislators?
unknown
speaker
there
are
no
materials.
i
mean,
some
states
don't
have
legislative
history.
they
just
don't
keep
it.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
call
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
so
were...
were...
was
testimony
taken
from
legislators
asking
why
did
you
vote
for
this
bill?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
affidavits
from
legislators?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
they
explain
why
they
voted
as
they
did?
if,
as
you
say,
the...
the
intent
of
the
legislature
is
the
criterion,
why
didn't
you
ask
them,
why
did
you
vote
the
way
you
did?
unknown
speaker
the
whole
is
the
sum
of
its
parts.
if
you're
really
interested
in
why
the
legislature
did
it,
you
ought
to
get
affidavits
from
every
legislator
saying
this
is
why
i
voted
for
it,
and
if
51
percent
voted
for
it
for
a
certain
reason,
that
was
the
reason.
unknown
speaker
if
that's
how
it's
done
in
iowa,
it
can
be
done
that
way.
this
court,
when
it's
dealing
with
tax
cases,
it
doesn't
do
it
that
way.
it
doesn't
look
for
the
actual
purpose.
and
in...
and
in
the
wiesenfeld
case,
the
whole
thing
was
driven
by
it
being
a
gender
classification,
and
the
government's
argument
was
this
was
pure
favor
to
women.
and
the
argument
is,
no,
that
was
not
the
actual
purpose.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you're
looking
at
what...
what
the
legislature
did,
they
did
one
thing
great
for
the
racetracks.
they
gave
them
permission
to
have
these
slot
machines,
which
they
didn't
before,
so
they're
preferring
the
racetracks
by
giving
them
this,
but
they
say
not
too
much
because
we're
going
to
let
you
make
money
from
these
slot
machines,
but
not
too
much.
we're
going
to
take
a
piece
of
it.
so
you
like
what
they
did,
the
permission
to
have
the
slot
machines,
but
then
say,
ah,
but
once...
they
have
to
give
us
as
sweet
a
deal
as
they
gave
the
riverboats.
they
didn't
have
to
give
you
anything.
they
didn't
have
to
let
you
have
the
slot
machines.
unknown
speaker
but
it
was...
it
all
came
in
in
the
same
legislation,
didn't
it--
unknown
speaker
--so
they
gave
you
something
you
never
had
before
and
it
was
pretty
good,
but
you
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--well,
then
to
treat
you
the
same,
i
think
that
they
would
have
to
raise
the
parimutuel
betting
from
5
percent,
whatever
it
was,
to
20
percent.
unknown
speaker
that
the
riverboats
do
that
or
that
the
tracks
do
that?
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
you
said
the
riverboats.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand,
the
riverboats
wouldn't
make
money
either
if
they
didn't
have
the
slot
machines.
unknown
speaker
so
how
does
this
work?
i
mean,
i
thought
there
was
a
distinction
between
your
trying
to
show
in
a
case
like
this
that
the
rational
purposes
that
are
advanced
simply
are
not
served...
that's
a
factual
matter.
and
i
take
it
that's
allegheny.
they
showed
that
the...
that
this
wasn't
a
way
to
bring
about
what
they
claimed.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
but
it's
not
open
to
you
to
show
that
the
legislature
didn't
really
have
that
motive
for
the
reason
that
if
the
courts
permitted
you
to
show
it,
there
would
be
no
end
to
that.
people
would
be
arguing
about
legislative
theories
in
state
cases
like
this
forever.
so
if
that's
right...
i...
i
mean,
you're
not...
i
don't
think
you
can
show
the
first.
maybe
you
can.
unknown
speaker
yes...
is
you
can.
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
think
it
did
leave
it
open,
but
you
see,
they
come
in
with
some
rational
purposes,
and
you
think
you've
showed
here
that...
that
they
don't...
that
this...
this
particular
statute
could
not
serve
those
purposes
as
a
matter
of
the
world
of
fact?
i
mean,
one
is,
for
example,
they
say
if
we
don't
have
a
lower
rate...
you've
heard
it...
they'll
go
off
to
some
other
place,
and
they
have
one
that
went
to
some
other
place.
and
you
don't
deny
they
went
to
some
other
place.
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
another
factor
that...
that
was
part
of
it,
isn't
it?
there
was
a
20
percent
rate
across
everything,
all
the
kinds
of
games
that
they
have
on
the
riverboat.
so
that's
nice
and
administratively
convenient.
you
don't
want
to
have
one
rate
for
the
slot
machines
and
another
one
for
blackjack.
unknown
speaker
may...
may
i
address
a...
a
slightly
different
argument
that
you
were
making,
i
think
you
were
making
a
minute
ago?
and
that
is,
now...
it
had
two
premises.
number
one,
you
said
our
own
cases
show
that
a...
a
conceivable
rational
basis
cannot
be
relied
upon
when
the
record
indicates
that
in
fact
that
was
not
the
basis
for
the
legislation.
so
fact
limits
what
is...
what
can
be
considered
as
conceivable.
number
two,
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
iowa
supreme
court
made
a
determination
about
the...
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and...
and
at
least
they
determined
that
the
purpose
of
that
statute
was
not
to
aid
riverboat
gambling.
so
i
take
it
your
argument
is
you
can't
argue
that
this
differential
treatment
is
rationally
related
to
the
promotion
of...
of
riverboat
development
or
river
development
because
the
iowa
supreme
court
has
definitively
determined
that
that
was
not
the
case.
is
that
a
fair
statement?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
my...
my
question
i
guess
is
this.
there
is
no
question
that
the
iowa
supreme
court
in
the
construction
of
the
iowa
constitution
can
approach
matters
that
way.
if
this
court
approaches
matters
that
way,
then
in
effect
we're
going
to
have
two
different
methodologies,
one
for
federal
cases,
i
guess,
and...
and
one
for...
for
state
cases.
and
we're
going
to
have
to
take
every
state
case
subject
to
fact
determinations
made
by
the
state
courts,
and
that's
going
to
limit
the
application
of
this
conceivable
rational
basis
test.
why
would
it
not
be
wiser
for
us
to
say,
just
to
keep
the
systems
running
smoothly,
look,
we
are
not
going
to
be
bound
by
state
court
determinations
of
legislative
intent
or
purpose?
the
state
courts
are
perfectly
free
to
do
that
under
their
own
constitutions,
but
when
it
gets
to
us,
we
will
not
accept,
for
example,
the
determination
in
a
case
like
this
by
iowa
that
the
purpose
was
not
to
aid
riverboat
gambling.
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
sensible
way
for
us
to...
to
go,
leaving
the
state
courts
to
run
their
systems
any
way
they
want
to?
unknown
speaker
but
this
isn't
a
question
of
state
law.
it's
a
question
of
state
fact
in
applying
a
federal
law,
i.e.,
the...
the
rational
basis
scrutiny
under
the
federal...
the
equal
protection
clause.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was...
involved
interstate
discrimination
against
out-of-state
actors.
unknown
speaker
but
here
you
have
everybody
internal
in
the
same...
the
same
state.
so
i
think
that's
a
different
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
not
discriminating
against
out-of-staters,
which
is
a
federal
concern.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you're...
if
you're
right
about
how
iowa
goes
about
doing
things,
then
you
go
back
and
tell
the
iowa
court,
the
supreme
court
has
this
any
conceivable
purpose
test.
you
have
what's
the
real
purpose
test.
so
now
say
we'll
apply
our
own
state
notion
of
what
equal
protection
is
and...
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mccormick,
why
isn't
there
a
categorization
problem
in
this
case?
i
mean,
there
is
no
iowa
law
pertaining
to
slot
machines
in
particular.
there
is
a
law
taxing
table
games
at...
the
revenues
from
that,
at
20
percent.
right?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
perfectly
reasonable
to
look
upon
these
laws
this
way:
iowa
is
taxing
a
business
which
has
nothing
but
table
games
at
20
percent
on
all
the
table
games.
it
is
taxing
a
business
which
has
parimutuel
betting
plus
slot
machines
at
5
percent
for
the
parimutuel
betting
and
<thirty-four>
[=
34]
percent
for
the
slot
machines.
i
mean,
you
certainly
wouldn't
be
complaining
if
they
taxed
racetracks
at
a
combined
rate
of
15
percent
or...
or
a
combined
rate
of...
of
30
percent
for
that
matter.
now
you...
you
would
have
no
complaint.
so
why
does
it
make
any
difference
if
they
simply,
instead
of
picking
one
percentage,
charge
5
percent
on
the
parimutuel
and
34
percent
on
the
slot
machines?
but
they're
two
different
businesses.
one
is
just
table
games.
the
other
one
is
horse...
horse
racing
and
slot
machines.
they're...
they're
different
businesses.
they're
taxed
differently.
unknown
speaker
your
court
is
entitled
to...
to
view
it
that
way
from
state
law,
but
they
were...
they've
said
that
state
law
mirrors
federal
law,
and
just
because
they
choose
to
look
at
it
that
way,
that
doesn't
mean
i
have
to
look
at
it
that
way.
unknown
speaker
it's
an
odd
position
when
you
say
there
was
no
obligation
whatever
for
the
state
to
allow
slot
machines
at
racetracks,
but
if
they
allow
it,
they
have
to
be
as
generous
to
the
racetrack
as
they
were
to
the
riverboats.
what
didn't
come
in
as
a
discrete
item
came
in
as
part
of
the
whole
gambling
operation.
it
is
strange
to
say
not
only...
once
you
give
it
to
us,
you
have
to
give
us
the
best
deal.
unknown
speaker
but
you'd
have
no
equal
protection
argument
at
all
if
they
didn't
let
you
have
the
slot
machines.
unknown
speaker
iowa...
the
iowa
court
made
the
statement,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
iowa
equal
protection
clause
and
the
national
equal
protection
clause
had
identical
requirements
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
okay.
now
assume,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
we
don't
accept
the
analysis
for
purposes
of
federal
equal
protection.
do
you
understand
the
iowa
decision
to
be
that
there
is...
despite
that
finding
on
our
part
or
that
conclusion
on
our
part,
that
there
is
no
question
that
what
they
said
in
that
opinion
does
reflect
the
iowa
equal
protection
clause
and
the
result
that
they
reached
will
be
and...
and
can
be
found
on
the
basis
of
this
opinion
to
be
the
result
under
the
iowa
clause?
unknown
speaker
so
that
what
we
do
will
make
no
difference
in
the...
in
the
ultimate
result
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
unless
they
change
their
rationale,
there
is
no
question,
as
i
understand
it,
on
the
basis
of
this
opinion
what
the
result
will
be.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you're
going
to...
yes.
i
mean,
that's
what
i--
--they
can't
blame
it
on
us.
no,
that's
quite
right.
i
mean,
right
now
they're
blaming
it
on
us,
and
if
they
want
to
take
the
blame
themselves...
how...
how
are
they
appointed?
are
they
appointed
or
elected?
unknown
speaker
missouri
plan
appointed.
well,
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
in...
in
its
opinion
in
this
case
said
that
the
iowa
equal
protection
clause
and
the
federal
clause
were
the
same
or
subject
to
the
same
analysis,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
if
we
decide
that
it's
wrong
on
the
federal
section,
it
goes
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
they
could
just
as
easily
say,
well,
our...
our
state
equal
protection
follows
federal
equal
protection.
if
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
says
the
federal
is
one,
we're
going
to
follow
the
federal.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
foreordained
what
they
will
do.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think...
you
think
that
is
open
to
them--
unknown
speaker
--the
way...
the
way
they
wrote
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
they'd
have
to
eat
their
words.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
they'd
have
to
say
we're
changing
our
law.
unknown
speaker
and
i
doubt
that
this
is
the
first...
is
this
the
first
case
in
which
they've
said
we...
we
follow
federal
law
on
equal
protection?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
so.
unknown
speaker
judges
don't
like
to
eat
their
words.
unknown
speaker
but
as
i
understand
it,
they
didn't
say,
we
follow
the
feds.
they
said,
they
are
identical.
unknown
speaker
it
would
mean
they
were
wrong
twice,
both
in
their
interpretation
of
federal
law
and
also
in
their
interpretation
of
iowa
law,
right?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
get
the
boat
to
the
landlocked
lake?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
humphrey
bogart.
humphrey
bogart
gets
it
there
i
think.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
mccormick.
mr.
miller...
general
miller,
you
have
four--
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
