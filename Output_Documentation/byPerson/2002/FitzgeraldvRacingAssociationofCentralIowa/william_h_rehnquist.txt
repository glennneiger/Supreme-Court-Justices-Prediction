we'll
hear
argument
next
in

02-695,
michael
fitzgerald
v.
racing
association
of
central
iowa.
spectators
are
admonished,
do
not
talk
until
you
leave
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
we'll
wait
just

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
miller.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
is
02-695,
fitzgerald
versus
the
racing
association
of
central
iowa.
iowa
tax
has
adjusted
revenues
from
slot
machines
at
racetracks
had
graduated
rates
with
a
maximum
rate
of
36%.
the
tax
has
adjusted
revenues
from
slot
machines
on
riverboats
at
graduated
rates
with
a
maximum
rate
of
20%.
the
iowa
supreme
court
held
that
this
tax
rate
difference,
36%
as
opposed
to
20%,
violated
the
federal
constitution's
equal
protection
clause.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
breyer
we
reversed,
as
the
court
stated
in
nordlingerv.
hahn
“differences
in
state
tax
rates
do
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
so
long
as
there
is
a
plausible
policy
reason
for
the
classification”.
the
legislature
may
have
considered
the
underlying
legislative
facts
to
be
true
and
the
differences
reflect
a
classification
that
is
not
arbitrary
or
irrational.
that
standard
is
satisfied
here.
the
legislature
may
have
wanted
a
lower
riverboat
tax
rate,
for
example,
to
encourage
riverboats
to
remain
within
iowa
or
to
help
the
communities
in
which
the
riverboats
are
located.
there
is
nothing
irrational
or
arbitrary
about
such
justification.
for
these
reasons
and
other
set
forth
in
the
opinion
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
