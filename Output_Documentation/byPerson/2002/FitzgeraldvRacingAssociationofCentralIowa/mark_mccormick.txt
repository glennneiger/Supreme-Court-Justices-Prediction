mr.
mark
mccormick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
iowa
supreme
court
in
this
case,
as
this
court
will
determine
as
it
reviews
the
opinion,
addressed
two
questions,
not
merely
one
question,
in
this
equal
protection
challenge.
the
first
question
the
court
addressed
is
what
did
the
legislature
have
in
mind
in
enacting
this
legislation.
in
doing
so
and
in
answering
that
question,
the
state
court
was
doing
what
state
courts
routinely
do,
interpreting
state
law.
once
having
determined
the
meaning
of
state
law,
as
was
its
prerogative,
the
court
then
moved
to
the
second
question
which
is
the
only
question
that
the
state
and
the
united
states
have
argued
here,
really,
which
is
the
equal
protection
issue.
we
think
the
first
question
has
to
be
answered
before
you
jump
to
the
second.
mr.
mark
mccormick
the...
the
decision
in
beach,
as
i
understand
it,
did
require
the
establishment
of
a
legitimate
state
purpose
under
the
fcc
provision
that
was
at
issue.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
had
sent
the
case
back
to
the
fcc
said,
we
can't
think
of
a
better
reason
than
was
given
by
judge
mikva
in
his
concurring
opinion,
and
this
court
accepted
that
as
being
a
plausible
basis
then
for
the
distinction
that
was
at
issue
in
that
case.
mr.
mark
mccormick
i
think
you
do,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
case
that
was
mentioned
earlier,
the
weinberger
case,
is
an
illustration
of
how
it
makes
a
difference.
in
that
case,
as
the
court
ultimately
found,
there
was
gender
discrimination
which
was
inappropriate
in
dealing
with
the
issue
of
survivorship
benefits
as
to
spouses,
and
the
argument
that
was
being
proffered
by
the
government
in
that
case
was,
this
is
okay
because
this
statute
was
intended
to
take
care
of
women
who
have
trouble,
when
they
are
widowed,
getting
by
in
the
work
place.
mr.
mark
mccormick
no,
your
honor.
i...
i
am
not
saying
that
the
analysis
was
the
same,
but
i
am
saying
that
the
court
looked
to
the
actual
intent
as
it
was
shown
by
legislative
history.
mr.
mark
mccormick
what
is
routinely
done
in
iowa
is
what
we
did
in
this
case,
which
is...
and
what
courts
routinely
do
at
the
state
level,
at
least
what's
done
in
iowa,
is
that
the
court
looks
at
any
available
materials
that
would
bear
on
the
concerns--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--that's
right.
mr.
mark
mccormick
i'm
telling
you.
mr.
mark
mccormick
we
don't
have...
we
do
not
have
records
or
transcripts
of
legislative
debates
at
committee
hearings.
mr.
mark
mccormick
no,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--affidavits...
excuse
me.
but
affidavits
were
obtained
that
explained
what
the
concerns
were
that
were
being
addressed.
we
have
a
full
record.
this
was
a
summary
judgment
motion
in
which
we
put
in
information
that
was
available
to
the
legislature.
mr.
mark
mccormick
yes,
your
honor,
but
not
saying
why
they
voted
as
they
did,
but
explaining
the
legislative
history.
and
the
iowa
court
routinely,
in
dealing
with
the
meaning
of
state
law,
has
accepted
the
kinds
of
materials
that
we
put
in
the
summary
judgment
record.
mr.
mark
mccormick
because
iowa,
like
this
court,
suggests
that
an
individual
legislator
isn't
competent
to
say
that,
but
iowa,
like
this
court,
will
permit
legislators
to
explain
legislative
history,
which
is
what
was
done
here.
that's
what
we
did
with
these
legislator
affidavits.
the
iowa
court
used
the
kinds
of
materials
that
states
use
when
they--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--in
a
state
like
iowa,
where
we
don't
have
the
kind
of
information
that's
available
from
congress,
what
we
do
is
we
ask
our
court
to
determine
what
the
legislature
intended
as
it
must
in
many,
many
cases,
including
this
kind
of
case,
and
offer
the
court
the
kind
of
information,
the
background
information
that's
available.
mr.
mark
mccormick
this
court
has
said
in
several
cases...
it
has
said
in
the
nordlinger
case
and
also
in
heller
against
doe...
that
even
in
a
rational
basis
case,
to
be
plausible,
a
justification
must
not
be
precluded
by
the
record.
and,
for
example,
that
is
how
nordlinger
distinguished
allegheny
pittsburgh
because
allegheny
pittsburgh
had
determined
that
the
west
virginia
property
tax
scheme
was
a
market
value
valuation
or
appraisal
system.
and
in
nordlinger,
the
position
was
being
advocated,
well,
this
case
is
governed
by
allegheny
pittsburgh.
you
can't
have
an
acquisition
value
system
like
california.
the
court
distinguished
allegheny
pittsburgh
by
saying
that
the
record
in
allegheny
pittsburgh
precluded
the
legislative
goal
of
having
a
market
value...
excuse
me...
having
an
acquisition
value
tax
system.
that's
how
the
case
was
distinguished.
mr.
mark
mccormick
well,
your
honor,
our
argument
about
that
is
that
they...
they
threw
us
a
lifeline
when
we
were
faced
with
economic
disaster,
just
as
they
were
throwing
a
lifeline
to
the
riverboats,
but
it
had
an
anchor
attached
to
it.
what
they
did,
of
course,
was
have
a
2-year
moratorium
before
the
first
escalation
of
tax
occurred
and
they
provided
for
a
total
of
10
years
before
the
36
percent
is
effective.
it
will
be
effective
next
year.
mr.
mark
mccormick
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
mccormick
the
iowa
supreme
court
said
what
they
did
by
that
legislation
was
put
us
in
a
class
the
same
as
the
riverboats
with
respect
to
slot
machines,
which
was
the
main
activity
at
both...
both
venues,
and
that
they
treated
us
differently
by
imposing
this
draconian--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--your
honor,
the
record
here
shows
that
parimutuel
betting
has
invariably
been
a
losing
proposition
at
the
tracks,
and
the
legislature,
when
it
passed
this
statute,
specifically
and
expressly
required
that
the
riverboats
use
the
revenue
first
to
pay
their
debt,
because
they
were
in
terrible
circumstances,
but
secondly
to
subsidize
the
purses
at
the
parimutuel
betting
and
to
promote
the...
the
horse
industry.
and
such...
these
are
mandated
goals
which
were...
which
the
legislature
required.
mr.
mark
mccormick
no.
that
the
racetracks
do
that.
mr.
mark
mccormick
i'm
sorry.
i
meant
the
racetracks
are
required
by
the
statute
to...
to
do
those
things.
parimutuel
betting
has...
has
never
been
a
source
of
net
revenue
in...
at
least
since
the
bankruptcy
of
the
main
racetrack
in
1992.
mr.
mark
mccormick
well,
that's
certainly
arguable.
they've
had
them
since
they
were
initiated.
their
problem
in
1994
was
getting
rid
of
the
betting
and
loss
limits.
but
the...
the
iowa
court...
and
it's
our
contention
that
this
was
a
matter
that
was
within
the
prerogative
of
the
court...
in
ascertaining
the
legislative
intent
in
this
case,
said
it
was
not
the
intent
of
the
iowa
legislature
to
benefit
riverboats
at
the
expense
of
the
racetracks.
mr.
mark
mccormick
yes.
mr.
mark
mccormick
well,
our
contention
is
that--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--this
court
left
that
open
to
us
in
allegheny
pittsburgh.
mr.
mark
mccormick
well,
the
question
is
not
only
legitimacy
of
a
goal,
but
whether
there
is
a
rational
relationship
and
whether
the
classification
involved
is
reasonably
related
to
any
differential
treatment.
as
in
allegheny
pittsburgh,
our
complaint
here
is
a
comparative
one.
it's
the
comparative
treatment
for
the
same
activity
essentially
in
the
same
place
because
we've
got
racetracks
in
two
of
the
cities
that...
that
are
the
cities
where
two
of
the
three
riverboats
were
in
fact,
and...
and
on
the
same
activity,
which
is
what
the
iowa
supreme
court
found
when
it
determined
that
for
classification
purposes,
it
saw
no
difference
except
that
one
was
a
facility
that
was
fixed
and
the
other
floated.
and
then
having...
having
made
that
determination
of
the
equal
situation,
the
court
looked
at
differential
treatment
too
and
said--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--yes,
your
honor.
and
that
rate
was
in
place
in
1994.
there
wasn't
any
change
in
the
tax
paid
by
riverboats.
the
legislation
imposed
for
the
first
time,
because
it
authorized
for
the
first
time,
a
tax
on
slot
machine
usage
and
activity
at
the
racetracks.
mr.
mark
mccormick
that's
certainly
part
of
our
argument,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
mccormick
we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
state
law
has
always
been
within
the
domain
and
prerogative
of...
of
the
state
courts.
mr.
mark
mccormick
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
invite
your
attention
to
metropolitan
life
insurance
company
against
ward,
which
came
out
of
alabama,
dealt
with
burdensome
taxes
placed
on
out-of-state
insurers
that
wanted
to
do
business
in
alabama.
that
case,
like
this
one,
involved
a
summary
judgment
proceeding
where
information
was
put
into
the
state
court
record.
the
state
in
that
case
advanced,
as
i
understand
it,
something
like
17
reasons
as
rational
bases
for
that
differentiation.
now,
this
court
reviewed
two
of
them
because
the
state
court
held
that
they
were
valid
justifications
under
that
summary
judgment
record.
this
court
reversed,
finding
that
those
justifications
were
not
valid
or
supportable.
they
were
not
rational.
but
this
court
did
not
go
further
than
to
look
at
the
other
proffered
justifications
by
the
state.
the
court
sent
the
case
back
for
completion
of
the
summary
judgment
proceedings.
and
what
was
being
done
in
that
alabama
case
is
exactly
what
we
did
in
this
case
by
looking
at
the
summary
judgment
record.
mr.
mark
mccormick
that
was
the...
that...
that
was
the
issue
that
was
being
reviewed
on
equal
protection--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
mark
mccormick
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
talking
about
the...
the
equal
protection
issue
there.
i'm
talking
about
the
manner
in
which
the
record
was
determined
and
the
state
court
was
given
the
prerogative
of
telling
this
court
what
it
determined
the
purposes
were
of
the
law.
mr.
mark
mccormick
we're
going
to
say
that
we
thought
the...
this
court
would
say
if
the
record
showed,
whatever
the
record
was,
in
this
case
our
summary
judgment
record,
that
the
rational
speculation
by
the
government
is
not
supported
by
the
realities
of
the
situation,
then
that
the
court...
that
sort
of
justification
is
not
plausible.
we
thought
that's
what
this
court's
view
was.
we
certainly
will
argue
to
the
iowa
court
that
it
is
within
its
prerogative
initially
first
to
decide
what
the
legislative
purposes
were,
as
it
does
in
many
cases
and
as
this
court
has
in
many
cases
respected
when
it
is
doing
federal
constitutional
review
where
the
meaning
of
a
state
law
is
a
threshold
issue.
we'll
be
then
inviting
the
iowa
court,
if
this
court
remands
the
case,
to
reconsider
the
case
under
the
iowa
constitution.
mr.
mark
mccormick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
mccormick
well,
the...
at
least
the
view
of
the
iowa
court
was
that
these
two
enterprises,
the
riverboats
and
racetracks,
are
engaged
in
the
same
business.
they
are
in
the
same
class.
and
singling
one
of
those
taxpayers
out
for
differential
treatment
violates
equal
protection
in
the
view
of
our
court.
the...
the--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--no,
your
honor.
that's...
that's
certainly
correct.
but
in
terms
of
the
classification
here,
we
think
that
the
state
court
was
warranted
in
finding
that
these
two
taxpayers
are
in
the
same
class.
parimutuel
revenues
have...
have
not,
from
1994...
actually
immediately
preceding
that
and
subsequently,
ever
been
a
factor
in
the
revenues
of
racetracks
except
a
negative
factor.
the
table
games...
that's
an
advantage
that
the
riverboats
have
over
racetracks,
not
a
justification
for
differential
treatment
for
putting
a
heavier
tax
on
the
same
activity
at
the
racetracks.
mr.
mark
mccormick
we're
not...
we're
not
really
saying
that.
we're
saying
that...
that
any
differential
treatment
cannot
be
of
the
magnitude
that
exists
here
and
be
consistent--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
mccormick
what
they
said
was
that
they
applied
the
same
analysis
as
this
court.
mr.
mark
mccormick
yes,
your
honor.
we--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--if
the
iowa
supreme
court,
if
this
case
were
remanded,
determines
through
the
use
of
the
same
analysis,
the
same
result--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--well,
it...
i
sure
hope
so.
mr.
mark
mccormick
they're
through
a
missouri
plan
appointed,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
mccormick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
mccormick
we
think
that
the
court
has--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--no.
you're...
you're
right,
your
honor.
i'm
just--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--i
think
that--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--oh,
i
think
so.
i
think
it
would
be
available
to
the
iowa
court.
mr.
mark
mccormick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
mccormick
that's
right.
mr.
mark
mccormick
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
mccormick
in
fact,
there
are
cases
where
our
court,
in
applying
exactly
the
same
analysis
that
this
court
has
done,
has
reached
different
results.
we
have
bierkamp
against
rogers
in
our
brief
in
which
our
court
invalidated
the
iowa--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--we're
hopeful.
mr.
mark
mccormick
well,
what
they
said
is
the
scope
and
the
import
of
the
two
constitutional
provisions
are
the
same.
actually
part
of
that...
if
one
looks
at
the
history
in
iowa,
there's
an
old
case,
1911
case,
state
against
fairmont
creamery.
the
iowa
court
for
years
in
interpreting
the
iowa
equal
protection
provision
never
made
any
reference
to
federal
law.
and
that
case,
for
the
first
time
in
1911,
cited
a
couple
of
cases
from
this
court
and
said
our
decisions
are
in
harmony
with
the
decisions
of
the
united
states
supreme
court.
i
believe
the
evolution
shows
and
history
shows
that
what
the
court
has
done
since
then
is
for
convenience,
because
of
the
availability
of
the
precedent
of
this
court,
said
we
use
the
same
analysis.
and
we...
we
do
the
same
thing
in
antitrust
law.
we
do
the
same
thing
in
civil
rights
law,
even
though
we
have
some
statutory
differences.
but
the
court
is
still
free
to
arrive
at
a
different
result
under
that
analysis,
and
in
this
case
certainly
the
court
arrived
at
the
decision
that
it
did
not
only
under
the
federal
constitution
but
the
state
constitution.
mr.
mark
mccormick
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
i
think
what
they
have
said
is
that
they
use
the
same
analysis.
they
don't
say
the
same
result
is
foreordained.
this...
our
court,
for
example,
doesn't
follow
the
lyon
case
on
the
issue
of
the
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
court
has
been
independent,
treated
state
grounds
as
being
adequate
and
independent
in
appropriate
cases,
even
though
generally,
as
it
said
here,
it
tracks
with
the
federal
cases
under
similar
provisions.
one
thing
i'd
like
to
mention
to
you
because
i
think
it
is
a
little
bit
of
a
misinterpretation
of
reality
to
suggest
that
these
riverboats
were
created
in
iowa
to...
to
sit
on
our
border
rivers.
the
statute
involved
and
the
implementing
regulations
will
allow
a
riverboat
in
iowa
on
any
river
in
iowa,
on
any
lake
in
iowa,
or
on
any
reservoir.
and...
and
there
is,
in
fact,
as
the
record
shows,
a
riverboat
on
a
landlocked
lake
in
southern
iowa
such
that
for
comparison
purposes,
comparing
these
racetracks,
two
of
which
are
in
river
cities,
and...
actually
all
three
of
them
in
river
cities,
but
two
of
them
in
river
cities
where
there
were
also
riverboats
at
the
time
of
this--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--it's
an
interesting
process.
one
either
builds
it
there
or
carries
it
with--
mr.
mark
mccormick
--yes.
it's
african
queen.
and
the
notion
that
there
is
any
particular
navigation
or...
or
sailing
involved
with
these...
with
these
methods
of
housing
gambling
activities
is...
is
more
imaginary
than
real.
i
appreciate
very
much
your
attention.
we
believe
that
this
court
in
reviewing
past
state
court
equal
protection
decisions
and
more
recently
in
the...
in
the
tax
area
in
williams
against
vermont
and
hooper
against
bernalillo
county
has...
has
respected
the...
the
determinations
that
have
been
made
by
the
state
courts
as
to
what
legislative
intent
was,
as
we
ask
the
court
to
do
in
this
case,
and
in
those
cases,
and
applying...
after
that
threshold
determination,
applying
equal
protection
analysis,
found
the
statutes
under
a
rational
basis
analysis
did
not
comport
with
equal
protection.
we
think
this
is
a
case
where
the
record
will
support
this
court
in
finding
that
the
iowa
supreme
court
got
it
right
and
that
the
state
and
solicitor
general
have
it
wrong
under
this
record.
thank
you.
