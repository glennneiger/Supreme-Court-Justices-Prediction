mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
answer
to
judge...
justice
scalia's
question
about
conflict
of
interest,
the
lower
courts,
in
the
wake
of
firestone
tire
&
rubber
company
v.
bruch,
have
grossly
confused
the
concept
of
conflict
of
interest,
dollar-for-dollar
conflict
of
interest,
with
actual
bias.
and
that's
the
problem
with
the
ninth
circuit's
approach,
the
eleventh
circuit's
approach
and
the
other
circuits'
approach,
is
when
we
have
evidence
of
conflict
of
interest,
the
courts
are
requiring
evidence
of
actual
bias.
and
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
standard
that
this
court
intended
in
the
firestone
tire
&
rubber
case.
now,
the
other--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--only
if
the
trustee's
continued
employment
is...
is
contingent
upon
your
satisfaction.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
because
you
retain
too
much
control
over
the...
the
disposition
of
the
trust
corpus.
in
these
voluntary
plans,
a
plan
administrator
really
has
a
choice.
the
plan
administrator
can
elect
to
retain
control--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--the
more
egregious
case,
your
honor,
would
be
the
facts
of...
that
would
be
similar
to
the
facts
of
this
case
is
if
the
balance
of
the
trust
reverted
to
the
trustee
if
they
didn't
spend
all
the
money
on
your
children's
education.
that
would
be
an
even
more
egregious--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--well,
scott
on
trusts,
the
restatement
of
trusts,
all
refer
to
those
decisions
as
voidable
at
the
election
of
the
beneficiary,
and
the
court
would
review
that
decision
de
novo.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
yes.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
yes,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
did
articulate
the
ninth
circuit
rule
in
the
context
of
conflict
of
interest.
so
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
that
focus
in
mind.
but
the
treating
physician
rule
that
was
articulated
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
both
this
case
and
in
the
nord...
and
in
the
regula
case
was
not
a
weighted
rule.
there
was
not
a
thumb
on
the
scale
as
petitioner
has
put
it.
rather
the
rule
that
the--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--it...
it
doesn't
require
rebuttal,
your
honor.
it
requires
rejection
for
substantial
reasons.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
i
think
that
this
court's
jurisprudence
and
the
jurisprudence
of
other
courts
in
other
contexts
have
stated
that
concepts
of
abuse
of
discretion,
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
substantial
evidence,
are
really
very
similar
concepts
and
there
are
very
fine,
thin
lines
between
those
concepts.
for
instance,
a
decision
that
was
made
without
the
support
of
substantial
evidence,
i
would
submit,
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
if
no
reasonable
person
would
conclude,
as
the
plan
administrator
did
conclude,
i.e.,
it
lacked
substantial
evidentiary
support,
that
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
the
court
would
readily
reverse
that
type
of
determination.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
in...
in
reviewing
the
record
as
a
whole,
as
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
universal
camera,
for
instance--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--well,
unfortunately,
the...
the
court
didn't
bold-face
or
italicize
its...
its
use
of
the
term,
substantial
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
i
think
the...
the
court
in
reviewing
a
rule
56
motion
practice,
reviews
the
decision
of
the
district
court
de
novo,
and
it's
entitled
to
substitute
its
own
judgment.
the
parties
at
the
district
court
agreed--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--correct.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
well,
the...
once
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
the
district
court
had
erred
in
rejecting
the
procedural
treating
physician
rule,
the
need
to
articulate
specific
and
legitimate
reasons,
and
had
concluded
that
black
&
decker
operated
under
a
conflict
of
interest,
and
black
&
decker
represented
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
it
not...
it
need
not
even
consider
plaintiff's
evidence,
the
ninth
circuit
exercised
its
discretion
to
reverse
and
pay
the
case.
and
that
is
a
question
that
petitioner
clearly
did
not
seek
cert
on.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
yes.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
your
honor,
section
1133
of
the...
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations
that
were
in
effect
when
mr.
nord
filed
his
claim
require
the
statement
of
specific
reasons
in
order
to
reject
a
claim.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
an
erisa
claim.
the
statute
and
the
regulations
require
a
statement
of
specific
reasons.
and
the
lower
courts
have
described
the
statement
of
specific
reasons
as
encouraging
a
meaningful
dialogue
between
the
person
claiming
benefits
and
the
plan
administrator.
and
it
would
seem
that
a
mere
statement
of
conclusion,
we've
accepted
dr.
mitri
and
we've
rejected
your
physicians,
is
not
a
meaningful
dialogue.
it's
not--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--well,
they
are
required
to
review
the
evidence.
that's
the
petitioner's
position.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
well,
too
late
would
be
a...
a
specific
reason
for
rejecting
a
claim.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
and
the
problem
with...
with
that
particular
analysis,
your
honor,
is
that
we
don't
know
whether
black
&
decker
in
this
particular
case
put
the
same
thumb
that
it's
complaining
about
the
ninth
circuit
put
on
the
scale,
that
they
didn't
put
the
thumb
on
the
scale
for
dr.
mitri.
and
for
all
of
the
reasons
that
petitioner
and
its
eight
private
amici
have
argued
and
also
the
solicitor
general's
office
has
argued,
putting
the
thumb
on
the
scale
and
not
weighing
evidence
evenly
would
be
just
as
bad
if
it
was
done
the
other
side
silently.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
mitri.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
it...
it
is
arbitrary
if
it's
simply
putting
weight
on
the
scale.
but
the
ninth
circuit
cast
the
treating
physician
rule
as
merely
a
statement
of...
of
specific
reasons
that
are
legitimate
under
the
statute
and
that
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
evidentiary
record
before
the
court.
but
the...
the
treating
physician
rule
doesn't
distinguish
between...
strike
that.
i'm
sorry.
the...
the
treating
physician
rule
does
distinguish
between
physicians
that
have
different
levels
of
probative
evidence.
the
physician
with
more
information,
the
long-time
treating
physician,
has
a
greater
source
of
information
upon
which
to
express
an
opinion
than
does
the
one-time
consultative
examiner.
and
that's
really
illustrated
in
the
facts
of
this
case
where
dr.
mitri
stated
that
mr.
nord
should
be
able
to
perform
a
certain
level
of
work.
and
his
intentional
use
of
the
word
should
implies
that
most
people
or
a
substantial
number
of
people
with
this
level
of
impairment
can
engage
in
this
level
of
activity,
in
this
case
sedentary
work
interrupted
by
standing
and
walking.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
yes.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
did
use
the...
the
phrase
that
the
opinion
of
dr.
mitri
was
overwhelmed
by
the
other
substantial
evidence
of
record.
so
you're
right.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
the
general
application
of
the
treating
physician
rule
that's
reflected
in
both
the...
this
case
and
in
the
regula
case
is
that
the
court
used
the
rule
only
at
the
conflict-of-interest
level
of
inquiry.
it
didn't
instruct...
in
regula,
it
did
not
instruct
the
lower
court
to
weigh
the
evidence
in
any
particular
manner.
rather,
it
instructed
the
lower
court
to
allow
delta
air
lines
in
that
case
to
come
forward
with
evidence
that
the
conflict
of...
conflict
of
interest
did
not
infect
its
decisionmaking
process.
again,
it
allowed
rebuttal
evidence
of
actual
bias
rather
than
the
pure
conflict
of
interest
that
the
ninth
circuit
found
to
exist.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
i
think
that
the
courts
are
confused
below,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
the
courts
have
created
this
hybrid
animal
that's
asking
whether
conflict
of
interest
exists
and
then
using
actual
bias
to...
to
animate
its...
its
decisionmaking
process.
and
that's
the
problem.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--i
think
what
the
ninth
circuit
is
saying
is
that
when
we
have
expert
opinion
and
all
else
being
equal,
given
the
fiduciary
status
of
the
plan
administrator,
that
the
treating
physician
should
receive.001
percent
and
tip
the
scale
slightly
in
favor.
it's
the
fiduciary
status.
it's
the
conflict
of
interest
analysis
that
really
animates
the
court's
inquiry
into...
into
this--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--well,
the
question
then
would
be
whether
the...
the
tests
that
the
independent
medical
examiner,
the
one-time
examining
physician,
either
mirrored
the
test
results
of
the
treating
physician
or
provided
an
independent
clinical
basis.
and
under
the
mature
treating
physician
rule,
every
court
has
held
that
independent
clinical
findings
that
are
divergent
from
those
of
the
treating
physician
is
always
a
basis
for
rejecting
the
treating
physician's
opinion.
but
that's
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
dr.
mitri
agreed--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--yes,
it
does.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
in
the...
in
the
treating
physician
rule
that
exists
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
social
security
context,
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
independent
clinical
findings
are
an
independent
basis
for
rejecting
the
treating
physician's
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
if
there's
no
objective
test
result
from
any
physician,
an
mri
or
a
cat-scan?
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
i
don't
believe
that
any
reasonable
person
would
accept
a...
an
intern's...
or
a
general
practitioner's
opinion
that
the
person
suffers
from
a
brain
embolism
without
an
objective
test
showing
the
existence
and
presence
of
that
embolism.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
that's...
that's
the
test.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
well,
it
really
depends
on
how
you
view
juries
would...
would
review
divergent
expert
witness
opinion.
if
you
assume
that...
that
a
jury
would
not
tend
to
give
a
source
of
evidence
more
weight
than
a
evidentiary
source
that
had
a
less...
lesser
pool
of
evidence
or
information,
less
probative
information,
then
i
think
that
you're
right.
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
juries
do.
i
think
juries
look
at
it
in
a
reasonable
fashion
and
think
an
expert
with
more
percipient
information
is
going
to
get
more
weight.
and--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
that's
exactly
what
the
court
decided,
justice
ginsburg.
and
i
think
that
your
analysis
is
correct.
the
court
looked
at
the
treating
physician
rule
and...
and
said
it...
it
creates
tools
for
the
courts
to
use
engaging
the
reasonableness
of
administrative
decisions
in
that
context.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
i
was
speaking
more
generally
with
justice
kennedy.
i
apologize
for
bringing
in
an
inapt
analogy.
but
i
do
think
that
the...
the
logic
and
fundamental
underpinnings
of
the
treating
physician
rule
engaging
any
expert
witness
testimony
is
that
the
broader
panoply
of
information
available
to,
in
this
case,
a
treating
physician
justifies,
all
else
being
equal,
all
else...
assuming
the
same
set
of
objective
tests,
that
the
physician
with
the
greater
source
of
information
is
entitled
to
slightly
more
weight.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
the
solicitor
general
argues
in...
in
its
brief
that...
the
government's
brief,
that
it
has
primary
jurisdiction
to
develop
the
regulations
and
flesh
out
the
body
of
erisa
law.
but
this
court
has
long
held
that
development
of
the
body
of
federal
common
law
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
well,
justice
souter,
the...
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the...
the
secretary
of
labor
has
not
even
addressed
the
conflict
of...
of
interest
issue
and
that
is
the--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--but
it
is--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--it
isn't
the
reason
the
rule...
it
is
the...
the
focal
point
of
the
rule
in
the
erisa
context.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
yours
and
mine.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
the
parallel
between
the
two
exists
on
what
questions
are
asked
and
what
answers
are
given.
the
structure
is...
is
far
different.
congress
enacted
social
security
as
a
social
policy.
black
&
decker
adopted
its
disability
plan
to
attract
employees
as
part
of
an
employment
package.
and
there...
although
it's
black
&
decker's
money,
it
has
still
promised
benefits
under
certain
circumstances
and
then
has,
for...
for
reasons
that
we
still
aren't...
don't
know,
concluded
that
despite
the...
the
clear
opinions
of
the
treating
physicians
and
the
ambiguous
opinion
of
the
independent
medical
examiner,
concluded
that
mr.
nord
did
not
sustain
his
burden
of
proof,
and
despite
the
clear
evidence
from
the
human
resources
specialist
that
mr.
nord
could
not
perform
his
usual
and
customary
work--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
i
wrote
those
interrogatories
because
i
read
dr.
mitri's
opinion
when
he
said
mr.
nord
could
only
lift
15
pounds,
and
i
looked
at
the
human
resources
specialist's
statement
of
bona
fide
occupational
job
qualifications
that
the
occupation
required
lifting
20
pounds
and
a
number
of
other
factors,
including
the
recognition
of
dr.
mitri
that
mr.
nord
suffered
from
a
significant
pain
syndrome.
i
believed
that...
that
ms.
forward
would
answer
those
questions
all
in
the
negative,
that
no,
mr.
nord
could
not
perform
his
usual
and
customary
occupation.
she
didn't
answer
the
questions
all
in
that
manner.
but
she
did
answer
the
last
question
in
the
negative,
that
mr.
nord
could
not
perform
the
work
of
a
material
planner
with
the
pain
that
he
was
enduring.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
well,
the...
the
question
wasn't
framed,
though,
as
terrible
pain.
it
was
occasional
moderate
pain,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
the
question
appears
in
the
record.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
thank
you,
mr.
paterson.
l36
and
37.
the...
the
sixth
question
that
was
asked
of
ms.
forward--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--yes,
in
the
large
petition
lodging.
i
can
read
the
question
in
full.
dr.
mitri
describes
kenneth
nord
as
suffering
from
degenerative
disc
disease
and
a
chronic
myofascial
pain
syndrome.
you
have
indicated
in
your
employer's
statement
provided
to
metropolitan
that
the
work
of
a
material
planner
requires
continuous
interpersonal
relationships
and
frequent
exposure
to
stressful
job
situations.
assume
that
kenneth
nord
would
have
a
moderate
pain
that
would
interfere
with
his
ability
to
perform
intense
interpersonal
communications
or
to
act
appropriately
under
stress
occasionally,
up
to
one-third
during
the
day.
could
an
individual
of
those
limitations
perform
the
work
of
a
material
planner?
and
the
answer
marked
is
no.
and
ms.
forward
signed
that.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
significantly
interferes.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
well--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--in...
in
asking
a...
a
question
of
a
vocational
expert
or
a
human
resources
specialist,
assuming
the
person
suffers
from
moderate
pain,
could
they
perform
their
job,
then
we've
left
it
up
to
the
witness
to
answer
the
question,
what
does
moderate
mean?
and
so
what
i
did
was
define
moderate.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
but
not
preclude.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
yes,
justice
ginsburg...
in
my
experience
if
you
don't
define
the
terms
of
art
in...
in
questions
to
vocational
specialists,
you're
not
going
to
get
the
answers
that
are
helpful.
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
that
was
certainly
available
to
black
&
decker
to
solicit
that
type
of
information.
she
was...
she
was
a
kwikset
employee,
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
black
&
decker
corporation.
they
didn't
ask--
mr.
lawrence
d.
rohlfing
--the
treating
physicians
didn't
comment
on
the...
the
opinions
of
dr.
mitri
because
i
didn't
ask
them
to.
i
read
dr.
mitri's
report
as
supporting
the
proposition
of
disability.
his
lifting
limitations
were
less
than
the
lifting
required
of
the
job.
the
standing
and
walking
that
he
needed
was
not
permitted
in
the
facial
job
description.
and
i
made
a...
and
i
actually
argued
affirmatively
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
dr.
mitri's
opinion,
properly
read
in
the
context
of
the...
the
employer's
statement
that
ms.
forward
had
filled
out
before
at
the
request
of
metropolitan,
actually
supported
the
proposition
of
disability
rather
than
supporting
the
proposition
of
no
disability
that
had
been
advocated.
and
i
would
hasten
to
point
out
that
this
plan
does
not
contain
an
accommodation
clause.
it
doesn't
say
if
you
can
perform
your
job
with
accommodation,
then
you're
not
disabled.
it
doesn't
say
that.
and
if
we're
going
to
use
contract
analysis
in...
in
determining
the
effect
of
the
plan
language
on
the
ultimate
issue
of
disability,
the
failure
to
include
accommodation
as
an
affirmative
prong
of
the...
the
inquiry
in
the
issue
of
disability
is
fatal
to
black
&
decker's
case
because
the
only
reason
that
ms.
forward's
answers
to
the
first
four
questions
could
be
supported
is
if
black
&
decker
accommodated
it.
