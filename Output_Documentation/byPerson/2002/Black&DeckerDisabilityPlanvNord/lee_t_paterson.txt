mr.
lee
t.
paterson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
has
adopted
a
treating
physician
rule
in
erisa
cases
which
requires
the
plan
administrator
to
either
accept
the
opinion
of
a
treating
physician
or
to
reject
that
opinion
by
specific
legitimate
reasons
based
upon
substantial
evidence.
the
ninth
circuit
says
that
this
rule
gives
special
weight,
deference,
and
a
presumption
to
the
opinions
of
treating
physicians.
the
failure
to
follow
this
rule
has
two
effects.
first,
a
finding
that
the
plan
administrator
has
a
conflict
of
interest
which
mandates
de
novo
review,
and
secondly,
on
de
novo
review,
that
the
plan
administrator's
decision
was
not
reasonable.
the
ninth
circuit's--
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
--the
secretary
has
adopted
regulations,
which
were
effective
in
january
1
of
2002,
which
require
a
plan
administrator
to
obtain
the
opinion
of
an
expert
medical
professional
to...
to
advise
him
regarding
medical
opinions
and
to
be
able
to
provide
an
expert
medical
opinion
to
the
claimant
if
he
requests
it.
that
would
not
apply,
of
course,
to
this
case
since
this
claim
was
filed
in
1997.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
no.
there
is
no
requirement
to
provide
reasons
to...
or
between
the
two
physicians'
opinions.
there
has
always
been
a
requirement
under
erisa
and
the
regulations
that
a
plan
administrator
explain
the
reasons
for
his
denial
of
a
claim.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
this
claim
was
denied.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
yes,
they
were,
your
honor.
they
were
given
by
the
plan
administrator
in
writing
to
the
claimant.
he
told
the
claimant
that
he
was,
in
fact,
denying
the
claim
based
on
the
opinion
of
dr.
mitri.
he
told
them
he
was
denying
the
claim
because
he
did
not
meet
the
plan
definition
of
total...
i'm
sorry...
complete
inability
to
perform
the
job
of
a
material
planner.
he
told
them
that
part
of
the
reason
for
denying
the
claim
was
the
fact
that
the
plan
administrator
had
asked
the
claimant
to
please
have
his
treating
physicians
comment
on
the
opinion
of
dr.
mitri.
he
did
that
twice.
he
did
it
in
writing.
and
in
neither
case
did
the
respondent
respond
with
any...
from
the
treating
physicians...
with
any
response
from
their...
the
treating
physicians.
and
he
also
did
it
on
the
basis
that
janmarie
forward's
opinion,
who
was
a
human
resource
representative,
was
not...
did
not
change
his
opinion.
so
there
were
those--
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
--no.
there's...
there's
nothing
in
the...
if
you
mean
the
secretary
of
labor's
rules,
there's
nothing
in
the
secretary
of
labor's
rules
which
relates
to
any
weighing
of
a
conflict
of
interest
by
the
plan
administrator.
there
is
a...
a
provision
in
the
case
of
firestone
v.
bruch
in
which
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
if
the
plan
administrator--
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
--this
court
said
that
in
firestone
v.
bruch.
and...
but
the
question
in
that
case
that
has
been
not...
it
has
not
been
decided
in
that
case
and
which
has
created
a
conflict
of
interest
of...
i'm
sorry...
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
is
the
question
of
what
does
it
mean
to
weigh.
does
it
mean
to
weigh
the
conflict
of
interest,
or
does
it
mean
to
conflict
of
interest
against
the
reasonableness
of
the
decision?
the
second
circuit
has
said
it
means
to
weigh
the
conflict
of
interest
as
provided
in
restatement
187,
and
after
you
weigh
the
conflict
of
interest,
you
then
move
on
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
decision.
the
ninth...
the
ninth
and
the
eleventh
circuits
have
said
it
means
that
you
weigh
the
decision,
and
if
you...
the
conflict...
and
if
you
find
there
is
a
conflict,
then
you
find
that
the
decision
of
the
plan
administrator
is
presumptively
void.
and
the
remainder
of
the
circuits
have
adopted
something
called
the
sliding
scale
test
where
you
weigh
both
the
conflict
and
the...
the
reasonableness
of
the
decision
at
the
same
time.
this
court
commented
on
that
issue,
i
believe,
in
rush
v.
moran
when
the
court
said,
how
can
you
give
deference
to
the
opinion
of
a
treating
physician...
i'm
sorry...
of
a
plan
administrator
at
the
same
time
that
you
are
looking
for
conflict
of
interest?
we
would
submit,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
that
the
way
to
do
that
is
to
first
look
for
conflict
of
interest
in...
in
the...
the
way
that
restatement
187
does
that.
you
first
test
for
conflict
of
interest.
if
there's
no
conflict
of
interest,
then
this
potential
conflict
of
interest,
what
this
court
called
a
potential
conflict
of
interest,
goes
away.
it
is
a
nothing.
it
has
no
effect
whatsoever.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
i
didn't
mean
to--
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
--there's
no
question
about
that.
i
didn't
mean
to
argue
for
a
difference
in...
in
the
standard
of
review.
we
haven't...
we
haven't
brought
that
to
this
court
on
a
petition.
i
merely
meant
to
respond
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
absolutely.
there's
no
question
in
our...
in
our
position
to
this
court
that
the
treating
physician
rule
is
an
inappropriate
rule
under
either...
of
any
of
those
tests.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
i
believe
that
that's
correct,
your
honor.
what
would
happen
is
we
would
go
back
to
where
we
would
have
been
if
the
treating
physician
rule
didn't
exist.
the
ninth
circuit
would
be
using
its
presumptively
void
test,
would
look
to
see
if
the...
the
claimant
had
produced
any
probative
material
evidence
of
a
conflict
of
interest,
which
actually
affected
the
decision
as
opposed
to
just
a
potential
conflict
of
interest.
if
they
found
that,
they
would
find
that
the
decision
of
the
plan
administrator
was
presumptively
void.
if
they
didn't
find
that,
then
that
issue
would
drop
from
the
case
and
they
would
then
test
the...
the
decision
of
a
plan
administrator
based
on
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
yes.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
refusal
to
follow
a
treating...
the
treating
physician's
opinion
or
to
fail
to
rebut
that
opinion
by
specific
legitimate
reasons
was
a
material
probative
evidence
of
a...
tending
to
prove
an
actual
conflict
of
interest
which...
which
affected
the--
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
--i...
we
would
certainly...
we
certainly
intend
it
to
be
different
if...
if
we
can.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
the...
the
test
in
the
literature
is
called
the
presumptively
void
test.
i
don't
believe
the
ninth
circuit
calls
it
the
presumptively
void
test.
they...
they
call
it
the
atwood
test,
the
atwood
v.
newmont
gold
test.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
yes,
and
in
that
sense
it
would...
they
would
be
void.
i
think
the
presumptively
void
issue
comes
in
this
sense,
your
honor.
when
the...
if
the
claimant
comes
forward
with
material
probative
evidence
of
a
conflict
tending
to
show
a
conflict
of
interest
under
the
ninth
circuit's
test,
the
ninth
circuit
says
that
there
is
a
rebuttable
presumption
created
and
that
the
burden
is
then
on
the
plan
administrator
to
come
forward
with
evidence
and
to
rebut
that
material
probative
evidence
that
there
is
an
actual
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
yes.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
that's
correct.
i...
i
don't...
i've
been
asked
these
questions,
but
we're
not
arguing
the
issue
of
standard--
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
--thank
you,
justice
breyer.
i...
i
hope
that
i
can...
i
can
help.
in
section
187
of
the
restatement
of
trusts,
it
talks
about
a
potential
conflict
of
interest,
the
possibility
of
a
conflict
of
interest.
and
this...
this
court
talked
about
that
in
firestone
v.
bruch.
that
potential
conflict
of
interest
is
not
a
conflict
of
interest.
it's
just
the
possibility.
and
any
court
reviewing
any
trustee,
erisa
or
not,
if
they
thought
there
might
be
a
conflict
of
interest,
would
look
for
that
conflict
of
interest
and
see
if
there
was--
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
--it
might
consist
in
an
erisa
case
of
some
direction
from
the
president
of
the
company
to
the
trustee
to
cut
back
on
benefit
costs.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
that
would
be...
then
he
would
not
be
representing
the...
the
members
of
the
plan
and
he
would
be
breaching
his
fiduciary
duty.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
that's...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
under
this
court's
rule...
or
decision
in
firestone
and
in...
under
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
that
is
only
a
potential
conflict
of
interest.
there
has
to
be
material
probative
evidence
of
an
actual
conflict
of
interest
which
affected
his
decision.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
it...
well--
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
--that
is
a
potential
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
and
i
think
that
should
be
the...
the
criteria
that
the
court
has
to
look
for
in
each
of
these
cases
to
decide
whether
the
trustee
is
actually
conflicted
or
not.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
there
is
a...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
there's
a
tremendous
difference
in
the
social
security
standard
as
formulated
by
the
regulations
of
the
social
security
administration
and
the
ninth
circuit's
treating
physician
rule
in
social
security
cases
as
formulated
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
erisa
cases.
perhaps
i
can
point
out
a
couple
of
those
things.
first,
the
social
security
administration
has
a
regulation,
which
it
has
adopted,
which
provides
for
a
set
of
criteria
to
be
reviewed
by
the
administrative
law
judge.
those
criteria
include
the...
looking
at
the
physician's...
the
treating
physician's
opinion,
determining
whether
that
opinion
is
well
supported
by
clinical
and
laboratory
diagnostic
techniques,
seeing
if
it's
not
inconsistent
with
other
substantial
evidence,
looking
at
the
length
of
the
treatment
relationship
and
the
frequency
of
the
examination,
and
other
criteria.
once
the
administrative
law
judge
goes
through
those
criteria
and
determines
each
one
of
those
positively
towards
the
treating
physician,
he
then
may,
or
she
may
then,
if
they
wish,
provide
conclusive
weight
to
the
opinion
of
the
treating
physician.
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
is
completely
different
than
that.
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
says
that
if
a
person
is
a
treating
physician,
then
the
plan
administrator
either
has
to
accept
that
rule...
that...
that
opinion
or
has
to
rebut
it.
a
treating
physician
under
the
ninth
circuit
rule
could
be
a...
somebody
at
a
local
well
care
center
and
you
walk
in
and
get
a
shot.
that
makes
you
a
treating
physician.
now
you
have
an
opinion
which
you...
which,
under
the
ninth
circuit's
rule,
gives
you
a...
a
presumptive
weight.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
well,
we
don't
know
that
for
a
fact,
your
honor.
there
is
a
statement
in
the...
in
the
statement
of
facts
by
the
respondent
in
their
opposition
brief.
there
is
no
evidence
in
front
of
this
court.
the
first
time
i
ever
knew
about
that
was
when
i
read
the
respondent's
brief.
if
that
is
true,
he
should
file...
he
should
refile
with
the
administrator
and
attempt
to
use
that
evidence
to
get
his
claim
reopened.
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
i'm
aware
of
in
front
of
this
court
on
that
issue.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
yes.
he
may
go
back
to
the...
the
plan
administrator...
this
case
is
still
open
because
it's
on
appeal...
and
tell
the
plan
administrator
i
have
this
new
evidence.
it
shows
that
i
have
been
disabled
since
july
the
15th
of
1997
and
i
would
like
you
to
consider
that
evidence.
and
the
plan
administrator
will
do
that.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
well,
i
think
that's
absolutely
right,
because
one
of
the
congressional
purposes
in
erisa
is
to
encourage
employers
to
adopt
voluntary
disability
plans.
and
the
social
security
administrative
regulations
were...
are
regulations
which
have
been
adopted
by
the
social
security
administration.
in
this
case,
the
department
of
labor
which
is
the
correlative
to
the
social
security
administration
for
erisa
plans
is
opposed
to
the
erisa,
or
to
this--
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
--i
think
it
is
evidence.
i
think
the
first
thing
the
plan
administrator
would
do
is
to
look
at
the
medical
opinions
which
were
submitted
along
with
that
report
and
look
at
the
actual
decision
of
the
administrative
law
judge.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
it
might
or
might
not
be.
but
it
if...
if
it
is...
if
it
does
show
that
there's
a
difference
in
the
condition
of
the...
of
the
claimant,
it
should
be
presented
to
the
plan
administrator
to
give
him
a
chance
to
make
the
decision.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
that's
correct.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
it's
at
l36,
l37.
mr.
lee
t.
paterson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
ninth
circuit's
treating
physician
rule
is
a
categorical
rule
based
upon
the
assumption
that
a
treating
physician's
opinion
is
superior
to
other
medical
opinions
in
the
record.
in
the
regula
case,
at
page
1139,
the
ninth
circuit
got
to
the
issue
of...
of
the
treating
physician
rule
prior
to
the
time
it
even
began
to
discuss
the
conflict
of
interest.
and
it
held
the
treating
physician
rule
requires
deference,
as
it
applies
under
erisa,
and
that
the
treating...
the
plan
administrator
in
the
ninth
circuit
must
defer
unless
there
are...
he
has
good
enough
reasons
not
to
defer.
the
court
then
later
on
in
its
opinion
addressed
the
issue
of
conflict
of
interest.
this
court
in...
last
year
in
ragsdale
v.
wolverine
when...
stated
that
categorical
generalizations
failed
to
hold
true
that
the
justification
for
the
categorical
rule
disappears.
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
categorical
justification
disappears
both
in
the
individual
facts
of
the
case
and
as
a
general
proposition
for
all
other
cases.
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
respondent
went
to
dr.
hartman,
his
internist,
with
back
problems.
dr.
hartman
referred
him
to
two
specialists,
dr.
zandpour
and
dr.
ali,
both
of
whom
examined
him,
tested
him,
and
diagnosed
his
condition.
both
dr.
ali
and
dr.
zandpour,
based
upon
the
tests
they
conducted,
provided
a
diagnosis
of
mild
degenerative
changes
of
the
lower
lumbar
spine.
the
employers
sent
the
respondent
to
another
specialist,
dr.
mitri,
a
neurologist,
who
agreed
with
the
opinions
of
dr.
zandpour
and
dr.
ali,
but
also
looked
at
the
job
duties
of
respondent.
dr.
mitri
opined
that
he
could
perform
the
duties
of
a
material
planner
if
he
was
allowed
to
stand
up
and
walk
periodically.
just
focusing
on
these
four
physicians'
opinions,
it's
clear
that
the
opinions
with
the
most
weight
are
the
three
specialists,
dr.
zandpour,
dr.
ali,
and
dr.
mitri,
not
the
treating
physician,
dr.
hartman.
however,
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
requires
the
plan
administrator
to
give
deference,
special
weight,
and
a
presumption
in
favor
of
dr.
hartman's
opinion
even
though
he
referred
respondent
to
specialists
for
evaluation
and
even
though
he
has
no
apparent
expertise
in
back
injuries
or
back
pain.
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
categorical
generalization
is
not
true.
in
addition,
the
amicus,
american
medical
association,
has
brought
before
this
court
its
statistics
published
in
its
own
publication,
the
journal
of
the
american
medical
association.
those
statistics
state
that
39
percent
of
treating
physicians
misrepresent
symptoms,
diagnosis,
and
severity
of
illness
when
their
patients
submit
insurance
claims.
there's
no
justification
for
a
categorical
rule
that
treating
physicians'
opinions
are
entitled
to
special
weight,
deference,
and
a
presumption
in
erisa
disability
benefit
determinations
when
the
professional
organization
of
the
treating
physicians
admits
that
treating
physicians
often
make
misrepresentations
when
their
patients
are
filing
insurance
claims.
there's
no
support
for
a
categorical
rule
that
treating
physicians'
opinions
are
more
reliable
than
other
medical
opinions
either
in
the
facts
of
this
case
or
in
the...
the
erisa
context
in
general.
in
every
case,
the
erisa
plan
administrator
should
weigh
not
only
the
source
of
the
opinion,
but
also
the
experience,
the
testing,
the
treatment,
and
the
credentials
of
the...
of
the
physician.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
should
reject
the
ninth
circuit's
treating
physician
rule
and
remand
this
case
back
to
the
ninth
circuit.
