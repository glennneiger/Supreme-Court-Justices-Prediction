justice
antonin
scalia
did...
did
they
say
presumptively
void?
i...
i
had
thought
that
what
they...
what
they
said
was
if
they
found
an
actual
conflict,
they
simply
would
give
no
deference
and
would
review
de
novo
as
though
the
question
was
up
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
what
they
call
it.
i
want
to
know
what
the
consequence
is.
i
thought
the
consequence
held
by
the
ninth
circuit
was
that
if
they
did
find
the
actual
conflict,
they
would
give
no
deference
to
the
plan
administrator's
decision
and
would
review
the
question
de
novo
as
though
it
was
up
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
there's
no
such
directive,
but
the
plan
is
set
up
in
such
a
fashion
that
it's
employer-funded
and
the
higher
the
benefit
costs
are,
the...
the
more
the
employer
pays,
and
hence
the
less
profits
the
employer
has?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
just
a
potential
conflict
of
interest
or
is
that
an
actual
conflict
of
interest
when
the
plan
administrator
is...
is
an
agent
of
the
employer?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
using
conflict
of
interest
in
a...
in
a
strange
sense,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
certainly
a
conflict
of
interest
there.
he's
supposed
to
represent
the
employees,
but
he's
an
agent
of
the
employer,
and
the
more
he
gives
to
the
employees,
the
less
there
is
for
the
employer.
i
would
call
that
a
conflict
of
interest,
but...
but
that
is
not,
for
purposes
of
these
cases,
a
conflict
of
interest.
that
is
a
potential
conflict.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
they're
not
really
talking
about
a
conflict
of
interest.
they're
talking
about...
what
should
i
say?
evidence
that...
that
the
trustee
was
not
acting
in
the...
in
the
employees'
best
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
you...
you
would
acknowledge
that
the
social
security
determination
is
evidence
for
the
plan
administrator
to
consider
even
though
it's
using
a...
a
mandated
standard
of
respect
for
the
treating
physician's
determination
which
does
not
exist
under
the
plan?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he'd
make...
make
the
same
decision.
i
mean,
if
he
didn't
believe
the
treating
physician
and
didn't
have
to
believe
the
treating
physician,
as
the
social
security
administrator
has
to,
to
a
greater
degree
anyway,
he'd
come
out
the
same
way.
i
just
don't
see
how
it's
evidence
in
a...
in
a
proceeding
that
does
not
give
the
same
weight
to
the
treating
physician.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
firestone
was
using
conflict
of
interest
in...
in
a
different
sense
from
the
sense
in
which
it
was
used
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
which
it
means
not
evidence
that
he
was
instructed
to...
to
keep
down
costs,
but
the
mere
fact
that
the
employer
is
both
the
funder
of
the
plan
and
responsible
for
administration
of
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
alone
is
a
conflict.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
treating
physician
evidence
have
to
do
with
a
conflict?
that's...
that's
what
i
really
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clear
that
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
means
by
substantial
evidence?
i
mean,
that's
what
substantial
evidence
means
in
administrative
law
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
it
means
just
that
minimal
amount
of
evidence
that's
necessary
to
get
a
case
to
the
jury
in
a...
in
a
civil
trial.
but
is
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
means
by...
or
do
they
mean
substantial
evidence?
you
know
what
i
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i'm
under
the
impression
that
they
mean
substantial
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
even
think
they
have
to
say
that.
the
reasons
for
rejecting
the
claim
is
we're
rejecting
the
claim
because
you
are
not
disabled
or
because
your
disability
does
not...
you
know.
isn't
that
the
reason
for
rejecting
the
claim?
it
isn't
a
requirement
that
they...
that
they
review
the
evidence
in
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
do
they
have
to
give
a
statement?
i
mean,
you
know,
the
administrative
procedure
act
requires
a...
a
statement
of...
of
reasons
for
the...
in
some
detail.
but
i
don't
know
that
this
requirement
is
anything...
i
am
rejecting
your
claim
because
you
filed
it
too
late.
i
am
rejecting
your
claim
because
in
my
judgment
you
are
not
disabled.
why
isn't
that
an
adequate
statement
of
reasons?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
you
wouldn't
have
to
review
the
evidence
of
why
it's
too
late.
well,
you
know,
so
and
so
said
he
got
it
then.
so
and
so
said
you
got
it
earlier
than
that.
we
believe
so
and
so.
you
didn't
have
to
say
that.
you
say
we're
rejecting
it
because
in
our
view
you
filed
it
late.
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
same
thing
with
a
disability.
we're...
we're
rejecting
it
because
we
do
not...
we
do
not
believe
that...
that
the
disability
you
have
claimed
in
fact
exists.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
now
saying,
it
seems
to
me,
the
opposite
of
what
you
were
contending
earlier.
you're
saying
that
substantial
evidence
means
more
than
just
the
amount
of
evidence
that
would
enable
a
jury
to
find
a
particular
fact.
because
if
that's
all
that
substantial
evidence
meant,
you
wouldn't
need
a...
a
treating
physician
rule.
that
rule
would
exist
for
any
physician
that
the...
that
the
plaintiff
brought
in.
if
he
brought
in
a
non-treating
physician
and
there
were
no
substantial
evidence
on
the
other
side
in
the...
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
sense
of
substantial
evidence--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
plaintiff
would
win.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
treating
physician
rule
is
a...
is
a
useless
rule.
you
should
call
it
the
any
physician
rule.
if
the
plaintiff
comes
in
with
some
evidence
and
there's
no
evidence
on
the
other
side,
the
plaintiff
wins.
that's
certainly
not
what
the
ninth
circuit
means.
and...
and
as
you
were
just
describing
it,
it's
not
what
the
ninth
circuit
means.
it
means
that
if
you
have
a
treating
physician,
you
need
substantial
evidence
on
the
other
side
before
we're
going
to...
we're...
we're
going
to
let
you
overturn
the
treating
physician's
determination.
isn't
that
really
what's
going
on
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
i
can
explain
the
confusion.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense,
but
i
think
i
can
explain
it.
the
ninth
circuit
is
simply
saying,
look
it,
any
reasonable
person
would
give
the
treating
physician's
opinion
substantial
weight
over
somebody
who's
not
the
treating
physician,
and
if
the
plan
administrator
does
not
do
that,
and
since
he's
presumably
a
reasonable
person,
he
must
biased.
isn't
that
what's
going
on?
the
ninth
circuit
has
simply
said,
obviously
the
treating
physician
wins
in
the...
in
the
usual
case.
and
any
plan
administrator
who
says
he
doesn't
win
must
be
biased.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
not
true
in
my
view.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
can't
be
rejected
in
this
fashion.
the
treating
physician
who's
a
general
practitioner
doesn't
know
anything
in
particular.
not
a
specialist
with
the
brain,
he
says
this
man
has
a
brain
embolism.
that's
all
he
says.
doesn't
say
anything
else.
doesn't
give
any
more
details.
and
somebody...
and...
and
the...
the
employer
goes
to
a
brain
specialist
and
the
brain
specialist
says,
again,
nothing
more
than
this
patient
does
not
have
a
brain
embolism.
that
would
not
suffice
in
the
ninth
circuit,
would
it?
you
would
have
to
take
the
opinion
of
the
attending...
of
the
treating
physician.
justice
antonin
scalia
both
of
them...
both
of
them
have
come
in
with
conclusory
statements.
why
shouldn't
i
believe
the
conclusory
statement
of
the
expert
who
examined
the
person
rather
than
the...
the
general
practitioner?
what
the
ninth
circuit
says
is,
you
have
to
believe
the...
the
treating
physician.
justice
antonin
scalia
whose
money
is
at
stake
in
the
social
security
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government's
money,
really.
and
if
the
government
wants
to
be
particularly
generous
to
the
claimant,
i
guess
the
government
can
be
if
it
wants
to
adopt
a
rule
that's
very
favorable
to
claimants,
which
it
has
done
in
the
social
security
field.
but
it's
not
the
government's
money
at
stake
in...
in
this
case
and...
and
in
all
of
these
erisa
cases.
it's
either
the
trust's
money
or
the
employer's
money,
and
it's
supposed
to
be
dispensed
according
to
the
agreement
that
the
parties
have
entered
into.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
different
situation,
and
i
don't
think
the
government
has
as
much
leeway
in
deciding
to
be
generous
as
it...
as
it
does
in
the
social
security
field.
i
just
don't
see...
don't
see
the
parallel
between
the
two
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
that
question,
it...
it
asks
him
assuming
he
can't
do
his
job
for
one-third
of
the
day,
can
he
do
his
job?
what...
what
answer
would
you
expect?
i
mean,
if...
if
you
just
said
assuming
he
had
moderate
pain,
could
he
do
his
job,
then...
then
your
answer
would
mean
something,
but
you
asked,
assuming
he
has
moderate
pain
that
prevents
him
from
doing
his
job
a
third
of
the
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i'd
give
the
same
answer.
you...
it
seems
to
me
you...
you
had
a
hypothesis
that
doesn't
help
your
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
didn't...
you
didn't
leave
it
available
for
her
to
say,
i
don't
think
that
moderate
pain
would
interfere
with
his
ability
to
conduct
interpersonal
relationships.
that
was
not
available
for
her
to
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we're
not
examining
their
evidence.
we're
examining
yours.
the
issue
is
what
does
your
evidence
prove.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it
proves
much.
