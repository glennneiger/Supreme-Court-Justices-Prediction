justice
david
h.
souter
but
their
analysis
would
be
different
in
one
respect,
i
take
it,
and
that
is
in...
in
the
case
as
they
considered
it
first,
the...
the
refusal
to
follow
a
treating
physician
rule
was
taken
itself
as
evidence
of
conflict.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
result
might
be
different.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why...
why
isn't
it
a
thumb
on
the
scales
when
it
requires
substantial
evidence
to...
to
rebut?
that
sounds
like
a
thumb
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
whatever
term
you
want
to
use
it,
unless
you've
got
substantial
evidence
to
override
the
treating
physician's
opinion,
the
treating
physician's
opinion
is
supposed
to
control,
and
that
sounds
like
a
thumb.
justice
david
h.
souter
since
the
secretary
of
labor
doesn't
agree
with
you,
why
isn't
it
better
for
courts
to
leave
that
kind
of
a
decision
to
the
secretary
of
labor?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm...
i'm
not
suggesting
a...
a
primary
jurisdiction
rule.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the...
the
labor
department
is
a
lot
closer
to
the
situation
at
the
trial
level
than
an
appellate
court,
including
this
one.
and
i...
i
simply
would
have
thought
that
the...
that
the
department
of
labor
was
in
a
better
position
just
to
make
a
practical
assessment
of
either
the
need
for
the
rule
or
the
probable
value
of
the
rule
than...
than
a
court
is
likely
to
do.
and...
and
when
that
kind
of
expert
judgment
is
available,
why
isn't
it
simply
sensible
for
a
court
in
a
common
law
capacity
to
say,
we're
going
to
leave
it
to
the...
to
the
party...
to
the...
to
the
agency
that
is
in
a
better
position
to
make
the
judgment?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
conflict
of
interest
issue,
you
just
told
us,
is
not
the
reason
for
adopting
the
rule
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
has
a...
it
is...
it
is
being
given
significance
in
the
conflict
issue,
but
i
thought
that
was
not
the
reason
the
rule...
i'm
going
back
to
your
answer
to
your
question
to
justice
ginsburg.
that
isn't
the
reason
the
rule
was
developed
in
social
security,
and
that
wasn't
the
reason
the
rule
has
been
adopted
here.
