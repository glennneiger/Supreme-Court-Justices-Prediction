justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--as
to
your
case,
what...
what
difference
does
it
really
make?
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
portion
of...
of
its
opinion
which
is
not
being
reviewed
here--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and...
and
in
regula
seems
to
set
up
a
two-tier
system
or
a
dichotomy
of
an
administrator
who
is
a
fiduciary
and
an
administrator
who's
not.
i
should
think...
tell
me,
maybe
i'm
incorrect...
that
your
position
is
that
the
treating
physician
rule
is
an
inappropriate
approach
in
either
instance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
your
point
is
that
in...
in
either
context,
the
treating
physician
rule
is
inappropriate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
am...
am
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
take
the
case
on
the
theory
that
that's
governing
in
this
case?
i
mean,
you
didn't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--seek...
seek
review
of
it.
it's
just
the
treating
physician
rule
that
you
want
us
to
talk
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the...
do
the
department
regulations
have
some
sort
of
a
threshold
test
for
whether
there's
a
conflict
of
interest
or
is
that
just
not
addressed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
firestone,
as
i
recall,
just
recognized
that
the
plan
administrator
can
wear
two
hats,
be
employer
some
times
and...
and
a
fiduciary
at
others.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
don't
understand
what
that
has
to
do
with
the
question
that's...
that's
presented
to
us.
case
a,
that
there's
a
treating
physician
who's
a
longtime
personal
physician
and
his
opinion
is
given
to
the
administrator.
case
b,
the
employee
says,
you
know,
i'm
going
to
see
a
back
specialist
and
he
goes
to
a
back
specialist
who's
never
seen
the
man
before.
should
there
be
a
difference
in
those
two?
i
mean,
that's...
that's
what
you're
here
to
argue.
and...
and
dr....
was
it
dimitri
or
mitri?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mitri
was
a
specialist
in
this
area.
the
treating
physician
was
not.
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
it's...
it's
perfectly
plausible
to
say
that
we
give
the
specialist
even
greater
weight.
so
what...
the
treating
physician
rule,
it
seems
to
me,
quite
arbitrary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
that
characterizes
it
on
a
very
fact-specific
basis.
it
also
referred
to
the...
is
it...
regula
case
in
which
it...
it
said
there
is
the
treating
physician
rule.
i
think
you
have
to
defend
that
rule
as
a
rule,
if
applicable,
in
the
generality
of
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
what
purpose
does
the
ninth
circuit
rule
says?
the
ninth
circuit
says
the
treating
physician
is
employed
to
cure
and
has
a
greater
opportunity
to
know
and
observe
the
patient
as
an
individual.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
its
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we
don't
in...
in
the
law
of
evidence...
i'm
trying
to
think
of
an
analogy
where
we
have
some
special
rule
for
a
particular
kind
of...
of
person.
we
have
expert
testimony
generally,
but...
but
this
is
not
so
confined.
i've
never
seen
a
rule
like
this.
