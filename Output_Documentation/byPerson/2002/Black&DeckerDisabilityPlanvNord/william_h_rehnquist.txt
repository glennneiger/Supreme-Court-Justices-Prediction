chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
02-469,
the
black
&
decker
disability
plan
v.
kenneth
nord.
mr.
paterson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
there's
something
to
be
said
for
the
proposition
that
if
you
have
this
private
system,
you
don't
necessarily
want
to
bring
in
all
the
bureaucratic
trappings
of
the
social
security
review
process.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
paterson.
ms.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
rohlfing,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
rule
56
judgments,
summary
judgment,
that
is
purely
a
question
of
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the...
the
fact
that
it
is
reviewed
de
novo
doesn't
have
much
bearing
on
this
sort
of
a
case,
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
the
treating
physician
rule
itself,
which
he
clearly
did
seek
cert
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
position
on
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this...
we're
now
talking
about
an
erisa
claim,
not
a
social
security
claim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
connection
between
the
treating
physician
rule
and
the
concept
of
actual
bias?
the...
the
two
don't
seem
to
have
a
lot
in
common
so
far
as
i
can
see.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
confused
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what...
what
if
you
have
a...
a
treating
physician
who
presents
a
paragraph
to
the
plan
administrator
saying,
you
know,
i've
treated
this
fellow
for
6
months
and
i
think
he's
incapacitated?
then
you
have
an
expert,
you
know,
another
physician
weighs
in
on
the
other
side
and
puts
in
about
six
or
seven
paragraphs.
i
put
him
through
some
tests,
this
and
that,
and
i
think
he
is...
he's
not
disabled.
how
does
that
come
out
in
your
view
under
the
treating
physician
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does...
does
the
ninth
circuit
recognize
that
the
treating
physician
rule
can
be
rebutted
in
that
manner?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
other
courts
have.
does
the
ninth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rohlfing.
mr.
paterson,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
paterson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-469,
black
&
decker
disability
plan
versus
nord
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
