no,
justice
o'connor.
what
the
secretary
has
done
has...
is...
has
not
opposed...
imposed
a
treating
physician
requirement
or
otherwise
constrained
plan
administrators
in
the
way--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--they
didn't
consider
a
treating
physician
rule,
but
what
the
department
of
labor
did
do
was
impose
a
series
of
requirements
to
ensure
fair
and
accurate
decisionmaking.
so
plans
must
conduct
a
full
and
fair
review
of
a
claim,
and
they
have
to
consider
all
evidence
submitted
by
the
claimant.
and
before
making
any
medical
judgments,
they
have
to
consult
with
a
health
care
professional
with
the
relevant
training
and
experience.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
there's
no
evidence
that
they
considered
it.
but
they
did
overhaul
their
regulations
for
2002
and
did
impose
a
lot
of
requirements,
and
they
took
a
very
different
approach.
they
didn't
do
anything
that
constrained
plan
administrators
in
weighing
evidence.
instead,
they
said,
you
have
to
consider
all
the
relevant
evidence
and
make
an
independent
judgment.
and
then
they
finally
required
that
the
specific
reasons
have
to
be
given
for
any
denial
in
a
manner
that's
calculated
to
be
understood
by
the
claimant.
and
in
the
department's
view,
what
that
means
is
it
has
to
be
in
sufficient
detail
to
permit
meaningful
judicial
review
for
an
abuse
of
discretion.
but
the
ninth
circuit
takes
a
very
different
and
categorical
approach
that
singles
out
treating
physician
evidence
and
has
a
requirement
that
reasons
have
to
be
given
if
the
administrator
is
not
going
to
defer
to
that
evidence.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it
began
with
the
courts,
and
they...
most
of
them
did
impose
some
requirement
and
some
outright
rejected
it
because
they
thought
congress
had
entrusted
the
alj
as
the
finder
of
fact
with
the
responsibility
to
weigh
conflicting
evidence.
and
the
commissioner,
in
order
to
bring
uniformity
in
this
massive
nationwide
government
program,
adopted
a
less
aggressive,
deferential
rule
in
its
regulations.
but
the
department
of
labor
has
not
adopted
any
such
rule.
rather,
the
department
of
labor's
regulations
are
consistent
with
the
background
presumption
that
the
trier
of
fact
has
the
responsibility
in
each
particular
case
to
weigh
conflicting
evidence
based
on
her
judgment
of
the
relative
merits
of
the
evidence.
and...
but
the
department
of
labor,
as
i
said,
has
a
very
different
set
of
requirements
that
don't...
that
leave...
that
are
consistent
with
that
background
rule
and
don't
constrain
plan
administrators.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
the
department
of...
regulations
don't
speak
to
the
question
of
a
conflict
at
all.
what
this
court
said
in
firestone
was
that
a
conflict
must
be
weighed
as
a
factor
in
determining
whether
there's
been
an
abuse
of
discretion.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
right.
but
under
firestone,
if
the
employer
both
funds
the
plan
and
administers
the
plan,
we
think
that's
the
type
of
conflict
that
can
be
considered
as
a
factor
in
whether
there's
been
an
abuse
of
discretion.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
courts
have
differed
widely,
in
the
wake
of
firestone,
of
what
this
court
meant
in
firestone.
the
majority
of
the
lower
courts
have
not
taken
the
ninth
circuit's
approach.
they
have
said
it's
still
an
abuse
of
discretion
review,
but
there's
a
more
searching
inquiry
into
whether
there's
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
if
the
plan
administrator
is
operating
under
a
conflict.
now,
that
is
not--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
the
type
of
conflict
that
can
be
considered
as
a
factor
in
conducting
whether
there's
an
abuse
of
discretion.
now,
however
that
plays
out
in
a
given
case,
our
point
is
that
you
shouldn't
have
a
special
rule
that's
limited
to
treating
physician
evidence.
and
we
think
it's
inappropriate
under
erisa
for
three
reasons,
and
i
think
i've
already
said
two
of
them--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--nothing.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
nothing.
if
there
was
some
failure
to
defer
or
inadequate
explanation...
first
of
all,
there's
something
wrong
with
the
treating
physician
rule.
but
even
if
there
was
some
inadequate
explanation
such
that
the
court
could
not
conduct
meaningful
judicial
review,
the
standard
consequence
of
that,
justice
scalia,
is
a
remand
back
to
the
administrator
for
further
explanation,
not
a
de
novo
standard
of
review.
but
that's
not
the
question
presented
in
this
case.
it's
rather
the
propriety
of
a
judge-made
rule
that
singles
out
treating
physician
evidence
and
elevates
that
evidence
over
other
evidence.
now,
again,
it's
inconsistent
with
the
background
presumption
about
the
trier
of
fact...
the
responsibility
of
the
trier
of
fact
to
weigh
conflicting
evidence.
we
think
it's
in
significant
tension
with
the
regulations
that
the
department
of
labor
did
promulgate
which
do
not
constrain
plan
administrators.
and
finally,
the
third
reason,
is
that
erisa
leaves
to
employers,
private
employers,
the
decision
whether
to
provide
benefits
and,
if
so,
the
discretion
to
devise
the
form
and
structure
of
plans.
and
a
judge-made
rule
is
inconsistent
with
these
discretionary
and
voluntary
aspects
of
erisa
because
it
tells
plan
administrators
across
the
board
how
to
weigh
conflicting
evidence
in
claims
arising
under
varying
and
separate
plans.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
regulations
require
the
plan
administrator
to
consider
all
evidence
submitted
by
the
claimant,
and
it...
it
would
be
relevant
if...
depending
on
what
it
said.
but
this
court
in
cleveland
has
explained
that
the
commissioner
of
social
security
applies
a
variety
of
evidentiary
presumptions,
not
only
the
treating
physician
rule
but
the
most
prominent
one
is
the
listing
of
impairments
such
that
the
social
security
administration
may
make
a
finding
of
disability
even
though
the
person
in
fact
may
be
able
to
perform
the
essential
functions
of
the
job
when
judged
under
different
legal
settings.
and
i
think
the
issue
in...
in
cleveland
was
whether
there
was
reasonable
accommodation,
and
the
commissioner
doesn't
consider
that
when...
when
she
makes
her
determinations
under
the
social
security
administration.
but
it's
just...
it's
one
piece
of
evidence
that
would
be
before
the
administrator.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
be
reversed.
