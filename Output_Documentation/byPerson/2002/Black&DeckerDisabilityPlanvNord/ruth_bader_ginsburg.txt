justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
didn't
tell
us...
you
didn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
you
are
correct
in...
in
that
regard,
it
would
go
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
there
would
still
remain
the
question
on
which
you
didn't
seek
review,
and
that
is,
just
how
do
you
handle
this
conflict
of
interest?
i
presume
the
ninth
circuit
would
go
back
to
where
it
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
get
back
to
the
question
that
you
did
raise?
why
should
there
be
a
difference
in
the
social
security
standard,
which
does
apply
this
treating
physician
rule
and
disability?
both...
the
question
in
both
cases
is
whether
this
person
is
unable
to
work.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
take
it,
you
would
not
be
happy
with...
if
we
said,
well,
the
ninth
circuit
went
too
far,
but
it
should
be
set
up
just
like
the
social
security
because,
as
i
understand
it,
this
employee
did
get
social
security
disability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that's...
that
is
open
to
him
to
refile
and
say,
look,
i've
got
social
security?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
different
record
before
the
social...
the
alj.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
later
in
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
the
ninth
circuit
was
trying
to
spark
for
erisa
the
same
thing
that
the
courts
did
for
social
security.
the
social
security...
whatever
the
rule
is,
the
treating
physician
rule...
that
started
with
the
courts
and
then
the...
the
commissioner
said,
okay,
we'll
adopt
it
as
part
of
our
regulations.
but
didn't
it
begin
with
the
courts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
it
be
relevant
evidence,
as
mr.
paterson
suggested
it
would
be,
that
this
man
now
has
social
security
disability
benefits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rohlfing,
the...
the
petitioner
didn't
raise
any
question
about
the...
the
conflict
of
interest.
and
so
we're
here
on
the
petition
which
raises
only
the
treating
physician
rule,
and
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
you
could
have
the
treating
physician
rule
when
you
have
a
separation
of
the
trustee
and
the...
the
company.
so
if
you
could
get
down
to
the
treating
physician
rule,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--since
it's
the
only
question
that's
raised.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rohlfing,
why
are
we
getting
juries
into
it
when
i
thought
the
genesis
of
this
was
the
ninth
circuit
said,
in
social
security
the
courts
created
this
treating
physician
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
commissioner
liked
it
so
much,
the
commissioner
embraced
it
as
her
own.
and
so
now
we're
going
to
do
the
same
thing
for
erisa.
and
that's
why
when
you
complicate
it
with
this
bias
or
conflict,
there's
no
conflict
in
the
social
security.
and
as
i
read...
that's...
that's
a
piece
of
this
decision,
but
as
i
understood
it,
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
saying,
as
far
as
the
treating
physician
rule,
is
it
was
a
good
idea
in
social
security
and
it's
equally
good
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then...
then
you
started
to
talk
about
juries
and
in
the
social
security
context,
it's
a
guide
for
the
alj,
not
a
jury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
was
it
so
clear?
first
of
all,
if
you
take
the
treating
physician...
was
given
an
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
expert's
opinion,
on
dr.
mitri's
opinion.
here
it
is.
not
one
word
from
either
the
treating
physician
or
the...
what
is
it?
the
orthopedist
who
was...
who
was
called
in
by
the
treating
physician.
so
the
expert
stands
out
there
all
alone
with
no
comment
on
it.
and
then
as
far
as
the
human
resources
person
is
concerned,
it
was
mr.
nord's
counsel,
was
it
not,
that
wrote
up
that
evaluation
for
her
to
answer
yes
or
no,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
think...
i
think
if
you
gave
anybody
that
question,
somebody
is
in
terrible
pain,
can
they
relate
to
others...
it's
not
as
though
this
was
some
kind
of
a
neutral
evaluation
form.
it
was
a
loaded
question
that
you
asked
her.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
find
the
question.
where
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
36
and
37
of?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
didn't
ask
moderate.
you
didn't
ask
just
moderate
pain.
you
said,
moderate
pain
that
would
interfere
with
his
ability
to
perform
intense
interpersonal
communications.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
wasn't
moderate
pain
in
the
abstract.
it
was
moderate
pain
in
a
quite
concrete
context
that
would...
moderate
pain
that
would
interfere
with
his
ability
to
do
his
job.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
perhaps
you
could
address
why
your...
the...
the
treating
physician
didn't
comment
at
all
on
the
experts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
a
rule
adopted
by
the
social
security
administration,
in
determining
whether
a
claimant
is
entitled
to
social
security
disability
benefit,
special
weight
is
accorded
opinions
of
the
claimant's
treating
physician.
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
does
a
similar
rule
favoring
opinions
of
treating
physicians
apply
to
disability
determinations
under
employee
benefit
plans
covered
by
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974
an
act
known
to
the
bar
and
bench
as
erisa?
the
answer
we
hold
is
no,
treating
physician
opinions
need
not
be
favored
over
other
evidence
relevant
to
the
claimant's
medical
condition.
erisa
and
the
secretary
of
labor's
regulations
under
that
act
require
full
and
fair
evaluation
of
claims
and
when
benefits
are
denied,
clear
communication
to
the
claimant
of
the
specific
reasons
for
the
denial.
these
prescriptions
by
their
terms
did
not
command
plan
administrators
to
accord
special
deference
to
the
opinions
of
treating
physician.
should
a
treating
physician
will
be
adopted
for
whatever
potential
it
may
have
to
increase
the
accuracy
of
disability
determination
under
erisa
plans?
that
question,
we
think
is
one
the
legislature
or
superintending
administrative
agency
is
best
position
to
address.
critical
differences
between
the
social
security
disability
program
and
erisa
benefit
plans
portion
against
judicial
importation
of
an
agency
ordered
treating
physician
rule
from
the
former
area
into
the
latter.
social
security
is
an
obligatory
nationwide
program
in
which
the
decision
maker
evaluates
the
claimant's
condition
under
a
uniform
set
of
federal
criteria.
erisa
plans
come
in
different
sizes
and
shapes;
benefit
determinations
under
those
plans
are
likely
to
turn
in
large
part
on
interpretation
of
the
terms
of
the
particular
plan
at
issue.
absent
department
of
labor
endorsement,
today's
opinion
settles
courts
may
not
order
application
of
a
treating
position
rule
to
erisa
governed
employee
benefit
claims.
the
district
court
so
held
in
this
case
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
disagreed
declaring
that
a
treating
physician
rule
does
apply
to
disability
plans
covered
by
erisa.
finding
that
declaration
erroneous,
we
vacate
the
ninth
circuit
judgment
and
we
ran
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
