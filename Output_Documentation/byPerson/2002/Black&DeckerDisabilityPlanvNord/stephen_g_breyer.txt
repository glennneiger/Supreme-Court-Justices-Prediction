it
is
difficult
for
me
to
get
to
the
thing
when
i
have
a
kind
of
basic
confusion
in
my
mind,
which
i
have.
i
don't
understand
this
conflict
of
interest
thing
from
start
to
finish.
that
is
to
say,
why...
why
is
it...
why
is
it
any
different
to
have
a
trustee
in...
in
this
kind
of
a
case
who
hires
an
insurance
company
to
look
to
see
whether
the
people
are
disabled
or
not
than
to
have
a
trustee
who
hires
an
insurance
company
to
run
the
whole
plan?
and
anyway,
why
is
that
different
from
a
trustee
who,
say,
runs
a
classical
trust
and
has
to
decide...
call
it
a
spendthrift
trust...
whether
to
give
the
beneficiary
$1,000
this
month
and
have
less
in
the...
in
the
corpus
or
to
give
him
$800
this
month
and
have
more
in
the
corpus,
which
might,
by
the
way,
grow
to
help
other
beneficiaries?
so
i...
i
don't
understand
it
basically
and
i've
read
enough
to
know
that
i
really
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
could
it
consist
of?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
was
when
they
did
that,
did
they
even
think
of
the
treating
physician
rule?
did
anybody
say
to
the
department,
maybe
we
should
have
one?
no,
i
don't
think
we
will.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
firestone...
is...
is
it
a
conflict
of
interest
if
i
set
up
a
trust
for
my
children
to
pay
their
college
education,
and
then
i
have
to
make
decisions.
suppose
i
hire
a
trustee
and
that...
or
i
hire
somebody
to
run
it,
and
i'm
going
to
put
more
in
if
they
need
more,
less,
if
they
need
less.
so
the
trustee
has
to
say
whether
to
pay
for
the
$80
a
month
or
a
week
or
whatever,
a
day's
spending
money
or
not,
and
the
more
he
pays,
the
more
i'm
going
to
have
to
put
in.
is...
is
that
considered,
under...
under
traditional
trust
law,
a
conflict
of
interest?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
it
is,
if...
if
i
say
you're
a
trustee,
i
can
fire
you
when
i
want,
then
the
courts,
just
in
that...
like
scott
on
trusts
and
so
forth,
would
say
that's
a
conflict
of
interest?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
understand
that.
i'm
just
trying
to
figure
out
what
classical
trust
law
would
have
been.
so
you're
saying
it's
the
same.
it
should
be
treated
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then...
then
classical
trust
law,
scott
on
trusts,
says
that's
a
conflict
of
interest
and...
and
what
happens?
then
courts
review
it
all
if
you
set
up
a
trust
like
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
why
doesn't
this
just--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
given
the
confusion
about
it,
why
isn't
it
the...
sorry.
