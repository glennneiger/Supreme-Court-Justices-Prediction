justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
say
the
same
thing
for
scope?
this
case
is
about
duration,
but
congress
from
time
to
time...
in
fact,
you
mentioned--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
expanded
applications
of
copyright,
and
congress
itself
extends
the
scope
from
time
to
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
make,
as
far
as,
say,
translation
rights
that
didn't
exist
before,
the
same
argument?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why...
or...
and
if
you
wouldn't,
why
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lessig,
on
your
first
amendment
argument
i
don't
see
where
the
retroactivity-prospectivity
comes
in,
because...
i
follow
your
argument
under
the
copyright
clause,
but
if
you're
saying
that
the
time
is
too
long,
the
public
domain
should
get
this
stuff
sooner
rather
than
later,
would
you
explain
to
me
how
your
prospectivity-retrospective
line
fits
into
your
first
amendment
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
first
amendment--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--argument
you're
making
that
as,
i
take
it,
an
argument
independent
of,
it
doesn't
hang
on
your
copyright
clause
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
let's
just
take...
let's
say
that
was
your
only
argument
in
this
case.
how
does
that
tie
into
a
retrospective-prospective
distinction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
under
your
intermediate
scrutiny
test
we
would
not
be
hypothesizing
what
might
have
been
in
congress's
mind.
your
first
amendment
test
is
a
stringent
one.
you
have
to
have
an
important
purpose,
and
the
means
that
you
use
is
necessarily
tied
to
that
purpose.
if
you
take
that
position,
i
don't
see
how
you
make
the
retroactive-prospective
line
work.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
congress's
pattern
has
been
to
treat
all
authors
equally?
i
mean,
the
reason
that
it's
been
prospective
and
retrospective
is
that
people
should
be,
people
who
hold
copyrights
should
be
subject
to
the
same
regime
and
not
have
some
people
who
got
their
copyrights
the
week
before
the
law
passed
treated
differently
than
people
who
got
it
the
week
after.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
congress
has...
or,
you're
not
disputing
that
congress
has
always
made
these
extensions,
both
retroactive
and
prospective?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
stick
with
1976.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
that
was
what
you
said...
that's...
the
pattern
under
the
ctea
is
identical
to
the
one
in
the
'76
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
judge
sentelle
did
not
deal
with
the
first
amendment,
as
far
as
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--recall.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
i'm
asking
you...
perhaps
i'm
missing
it.
i
haven't
seen
where
you
get
the
prospective-retrospective
in
connection
with
your
first
amendment.
it
seems
that
you're
just
saying
there
that
70
years
is
an
unreasonable...
is
not
necessary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
doesn't
serve
an
important
purpose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lessig,
the
clause
says,
congress
shall,
and
suppose
congress
decides
in
this
expanded
world
of
ours
that
it's
going
to
make
certain
changes
and
demand
other
changes
from
our
treaty
partners.
suppose
it
says,
well,
the
germans
led
the
fight
for
70
years
in
the
european
union,
we'll
go
with
that,
but
we're
going
to
insist
that
they
have
a
more
expansive
notion
of,
say,
a
fair
use.
now,
why
couldn't
that
fit
within
the
promotion
of
knowledge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
has
to
be
a
limit,
as
you
acknowledge.
perpetual
copyright
is
not
permitted.
who
is
the
judge
of...
within
that
line?
who
is
the
judge
of
when
it
becomes
unlimited?
is
there,
in
other
words,
judicial
review
and,
if
there
is,
what
standard
will
this
court
apply
to
determine
whether
something
short
of
perpetual
is
still
unlimited?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
is
the
way
it's
always
been
done.
there
hasn't
been
any
copyright
extension
that
hasn't
applied
to
subsisting
work.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
one...
justice
breyer
brought
up
ben
jonson,
so...
this
case
doesn't
involve
works
that
are
already
in
the
public
domain.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
subsisting
copyrights.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
authority
the
constitution
assigns
to
the
congress
to
prescribe
the
duration
of
copyrights.
the
copyright
and
patent
clause
of
the
constitution
provides
as
to
copyrights,
congress
shall
have
power
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
that
means
knowledge
by
securing
limited
times
to
office
the
exclusive
right
to
their
writing.
in
the
1998
act,
hereon
the
inspection,
the
copyright
term
extension
act
or
ctea,
congress
enlarged
the
duration
of
copyrights
by
20
years.
as
in
the
case
of
prior
copyright
extensions
in
1831,
1909,
and
1976,
the
ctea
provided
that
it
its
enlarged
terms
would
apply
to
existing
and
future
copyrights
alike.
petitioners
are
individuals
and
businesses
whose
products
or
services
build
on
copyrighted
works
that
have
gone
into
the
public
domain.
they
sued
the
attorney
general
seeking
a
determination
that
the
ctea
fails
judicial
review
on
the
either
or
both
of
two
constitutional
constraints:
first,
the
limited
times
prescription
of
the
copyright
clause,
and
second
the
free
speech
guarantee
contained
in
the
first
amendment.
under
the
1976
copyright
act
as
originally
enacted,
copyright
protection
generally
lasted
from
the
works
creation
until
50
years
after
the
author's
death
under
the
ctea.
most
copyrights
now
run
20
years
longer
from
creation
until
70
years
after
the
author's
death.
concerning
the
copyright
clause,
the
petitioners
do
not
question
the
cteas
enlarged
time
span
itself.
they
do
not
say
life
plus
50
years
was
enough
but
life
plus
70
years
is
too
much.
instead,
they
charged
that
congress
went
awry
when
it
placed
current
copyright
holders
in
parity
with
future
holders.
petitioners
urged
that
congress
lacks
the
constitutional
authority
to
extend
the
duration
of
existing
copyrights
beyond
the
limited
time
set
when
those
copyrights
issue.
as
to
the
first
amendment,
petitioner's
contend
that
the
ctea
cannot
survive
inspection
under
the
heightened
judicial
scrutiny
appropriate
even
for
content
neutral
restrictions
on
speech.
the
district
court
for
the
district
columbia
rejected
petitioner's
complaint
and
the
cout
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
affirmed.
in
accord
with
those
courts,
we
reject
petitioner's
challenges
to
the
ctea.
text
history
and
precedent
conclude
confirm
that
the
copyright
clause
gives
congress
wide
leeway
to
prescribe
limited
times
for
copyright
proteciton
and
allows
congress
to
secure
the
same
level
and
duration
of
protection
for
all
copyright
holders
present
and
future.
the
copyright
clause
speaks
of
times
taht
are
limited
not
times
that
are
fixed
or
inalterable.
congress'
unbroken
practice
since
the
founding
generation
has
been
to
grant
to
authors
of
works
with
existing
unexpired
copyrights
the
benefit
of
term
extension
so
that
all
under
copyright
protection
will
be
governed
even
handedly
under
the
same
regime.
this
court,
it
is
true,
has
never
before
had
ocasion
to
decide
whether
extending
the
duration
of
an
existing
copyright
comports
with
the
limited
times
prescription,
but
as
early
as
1843,
the
court
held
that
the
same
clause
of
the
constitution
permitted
congress
to
expand
the
term
of
existing
patents.
the
court's
opinion
today
adheres
to
the
view
that
to
satisfy
the
limited
times
instruction,
congress
is
not
obliged
to
draw
a
line
between
works
currently
covered
by
copyrights
and
works
that
will
be
so
covered
in
the
future.
as
in
other
cases,
congress'
exercise
of
its
article
i,
section
8
powers,
courts
owe
a
large
measure
of
respect
to
congress'
judgments
about
how
best
to
carry
out
the
authority
the
copyright
clause
assigns
to
it.
among
key
reasons
for
the
ctea,
congress
responded
to
developments
abroad.
in
particular,
congress
aligned
the
baseline
u.s.
copyright
term
with
the
extended
baseline
copyright
term
earlier
adapted
by
the
european
union
for
existing
and
future
copyrights.
in
addition,
to
international
concerns
regarding
intellectual
property
to
which
the
united
states
is
becoming
increasingly
alert,
congress
had
in
view
relevant
demographic,
economic,
and
technological
changes.
satisfy
that
congress
acted
rationally,
we
are
not
at
liberty
to
second
guess
the
wisdom
of
the
ctea,
however,
debatable
the
needfull
or
the
utility
of
that
act
may
be.
we
further
conclude
that
the
ctea
does
not
run
a
foul
of
the
first
amendment.
free
speech
in
this
area
is
not
one
sided.
on
that
point,
this
court
has
recognized
the
framers
intended
copyright
itself
to
be
an
engine
of
free
expression.
the
copyright
scheme,
we
have
also
emphasized,
incorporates
its
own
speech
protective
safeguards;
it
does
so
by
distinguishing
between
protected
expression
on
the
one
hand
and
unprotected
facts
and
ideas
on
the
other,
and
by
allowing
fair
use
of
copyrighted
expression
for
purposes
of
criticism,
comment,
teaching,
and
even
parity.
the
ctea
supplements
those
safeguards
albeit
narrowly
by
permitting
the
reproduction
distribution
and
performance
of
certain
copyrighted
works
in
specific
circumstances.
satisfy
that
the
legislation
before
us
remains
inside
the
domain,
congress
decides
to
first
branch
does
no
transgress
other
constitutional
limitations
and
having
no
policy
setting
role
to
play.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
stevens
and
justice
breyer
have
each
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
