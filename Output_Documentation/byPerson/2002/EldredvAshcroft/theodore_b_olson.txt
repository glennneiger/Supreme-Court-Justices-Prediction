mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
questions
today,
especially
the
initial
questions,
suggest
one
of
the
many
insurmountable
obstacles
to
petitioners'
petition
in,
position
in
this
case.
that
is
that
the
first
congress
explicitly
gave
copyright
protection
to
the
authors
of
any
books
already
printed
as
well
as
explicitly
the
owners
of
existing
copyrights.
thereafter,
in
1831,
1909,
1976,
and
1998,
and
in
numerous
private
copyright
bills
and
temporary
extensions
of
the
copyright
law
and
in
repeated
patent
law
revisions,
congress
extended
the
terms
of
federal
copyright
and
patent
protection
of
subsisting
works.
as
this
court
explained
100
and
some
years
ago
in
its
burrows-giles
opinion,
such
constructions
are
accorded
very
great
weight
and,
as
that
court
went
on
to
say,
when
consistent
and
unchallenged
for
over
a
century
are
almost
conclusive
that
consistent
construction
by
congress
of
its
authority
under
the
copyright
and
patent
clause
now
has
lasted
from
the
105th...
from
the
first
through
the
105th
congress.
it
has
been
sustained
by
justices
of
this
court
and
early
decisions
of
this
court.
it
is
consistent
with
what
the
law
of
england
was
from
the
statute
of
anne--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
congress--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that...
it
seems
to
me
that
there
may
be...
this
is...
the
clause
itself
is
a
very,
very
broad
grant.
it
says
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
there
may
be
limitations,
justice
stevens,
they
are...
require
considerable
deference
by
this
court
to
the
judgment
of
congress--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
contains...
the
clause
itself
contains
limitations,
limited
times,
authors,
exclusive
rights
and
things
of
that
nature.
i
don't
think...
and
the
petitioners
expressly
disclaim
the
assertion
that
there
are
any
substantive
limitations
in
the
"promote
the-progress"
clause.
what
the
framers
were
saying
is,
we
want
to
give
congress
the
authority
to
promote
the
progress
of
useful
arts
and
sciences,
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
may
provide
additional
incentives
for
the
patentee
to
exploit
and
promote
and
disseminate
that
particular
work.
with
respect
to
creative
works
like
works
of
art,
books
and
that
sort
of
thing,
it
may
provide
many
ways--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
isn't
inconsistent,
i
submit,
justice
stevens,
for
the
congress
to
exercise
its
juris...
its
responsibility
under
this
broad
grant
of
power
to
determine
that
there
could
be
many
ways
in
which
the
holder
of
an
existing
right
may
benefit
the
public
by
continuing
to
have
that
right
for
an
additional
period
of
time,
the
same
reason
that
congress...
same
reasons
that
congress
had
when
it
created
the
right
in
the
first
place.
it's
not
just
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
but
i...
we
submit
that
specifically
with
respect
to
the
copyright
clause,
but
i
think
it
applies
to
the
patent
portion
of
the
clause
at
all,
it
isn't
just
the
invention,
it
isn't
just
the
writing
of
the
work...
and
this
relates
to
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
my
colleague
a
moment
ago.
it
includes
the
dissemination
of
the
work,
not
necessarily--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--not
necessarily
the
dissemination
alone--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
something
is
already
in
the
public
domain.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
would
not
want
to
rule
that
out,
justice
breyer,
for
the
very
reason--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
think
that
it
could
very
well
be
yes,
for
the
reason
that
in
the
1790
statute
the
congress
specifically
was
aware
of...
that
there
were
state
copyright
laws
which
didn't
last
as
long
as
the
federal
statute.
several
of
the
states
hadn't
finished
enacting
those
copyright
laws,
and
a
couple
of
states
hadn't
enacted
them
at
all.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
may--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
because
i
don't
think
that
a
per...
i
don't
think
there
is
a
per
se
rule
that
should
apply
here
because
this
is
a
grant
of
congress,
to
congress
to
exercise
its
judgment
as
to
what
may
be
beneficial.
there
may
be
other
constitutional
provisions
that
come
into
play,
or
there
may
be--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
also
see
compliance
with
international
competitive
markets
and
the
laws
that
are
being
adopted,
and
the
incentives--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that's
not
just
uniformity.
it's
providing
incentive
to
people
to
publish
here,
as
opposed
to
publish
in
europe,
where
longer
terms
might
be
available.
there
is
an
incentive
to
distribute
existing
works
that
may
be
necessary.
it's
the
consistency
that
congress
is
promoting
by
saying
to
individuals,
as
they
might
have
said
when
they
enacted
the
copyright
clause
in
the
first
place,
we
will
not
only
give
you
14
years,
but
if
we
change
our
mind
tomorrow,
and
think
that
a
better,
a
longer
period
is
necessary,
we're...
this
is
consistency,
but
it's
also
a
matter
of
fairness,
and
it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
think
that
that's
a
very
good
illustration
of
why
the
authority
is
granted
to
congress,
because
if
you
are
an
80-year-old
writer,
that
may
make
a
considerable
difference
in
terms
of
what
you
decide
to
do.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
may...
because
you
may...
if
you
have
no
incentive,
if
you
know
that
this
is
going
to
go
into
the
public
domain
sooner
rather
than
later,
it
may
affect
your
judgment
with
respect
to--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
might
also
affect
whether
the
publisher...
what
the
publisher
pays
for
your
prospective
work,
justice
breyer.
we...
the
copyright
clause
incentive
provides
incentives
not
just
for...
not
just
to
the
creators,
but
to
the
disseminators,
the
publishers,
the
broadcasters,
the
film
companies.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
again
that
illustrates
why
the
authority
is
vested
in
congress
to
make
these
judgments
rather
than
in
courts
to
make
these
judgments,
because
we're
not
talking
about
the
effect
on
an
individual
author,
or
an
individual
creator.
what
the
framers
of
the
constitution
were
concerned
about
is
a
gross
judgment
with
respect
to
what
might
generally
provide
incentives
to
the
population--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that's
a...
that
is
a
difficult
question
to
say
whether
there
is
any
limiting
principle
when
such
a
broad
grant
of
power,
authority
is
given
to
congress
and
has
been
exercised
so
repeatedly
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
i
submit...
well,
first
of
all,
even
the
petitioners
acknowledge
that,
as
far
as
prospective
limits
are
concerned,
that
isn't
a
judgment
that
this
court
is
being
made
to
ask
and,
in
fact,
the
petitioners
acknowledge
that
it
isn't
a
judgment
that
this
court
should
make,
so
the
only
point
that
the
petitioners--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
would
seem--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
acknowledge
that.
and
anything
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
is...
well,
it...
let
me
say
with
respond...
in
response
to
both
of
those
questions,
an
unlimited
time
would
violate
the
copyright
clause.
something
that
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
an
unlimited
time
would
violate
the
copyright
clause,
but
the
framers
specifically
did
not
put
in
numbers.
they
had
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
thomas
jefferson
suggested
that
a
number
should
be
put
in.
we
submit
that
it
would
be...
even...
since
the
petitioners
don't
suggest
that
it's
an
appropriate
function
of
this
court,
certainly
in
this
case,
to
pick
a
number,
133
years
or
something
of
that
nature,
but
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
from
the
statute
of
anne,
1710,
we
have
300
years
of
history,
of
congress
thinking
that
it
continues
to
benefit
the
process,
not
just
of
the
productivity,
of
the
creation
of
the
work
itself,
but
the
dissemination
of
it
to
provide--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
framers
had
an
opportunity
to
say
immutable,
unalterable,
unamendable.
they
didn't
use
that.
they
used
the
phrase,
limited
term,
which
means
then,
meant
then
and
means
now,
a
certain
specified--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--number
of
years
under
the
statute.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
submit,
justice
souter,
that
there's
no
per
se
limitation,
that
if
there
is,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
for...
if
it
is
true
that
congress,
having
specified
14
years
or
28
years,
decides
that
doesn't
work
very
well
because
of
the
economies
of
other
countries,
the
parade
of
constraints
on
artists
in
other
countries,
the
reasons
that
we
want
things
to
be
preserved
or
distributed,
it
should
be
2
more
years,
or
5
more
years
later--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
does
apply,
justice
stevens,
because--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
work
has
already
been
created,
but
the
artists
that
are
creating
works
day
in
and
day
out
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
congress
has
decided,
there's
an
ease
of
administration--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we're
not
just...
because
we're
not
just
talking
about
the
author.
if
we...
we're
talking
about--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
but
all
of
the
history
of
the
development
of
these
clauses
suggests
that...
and
this
court
has
indicated
in
its
decisions
with
respect
to
copyright,
that
the
framers
were
concerned
and
the
congress
is
legitimately
concerned
not
just
in
providing
the
spark
of
creativity,
but
to
make
sure
that
that's
distributed
widely
and
available,
and
there
may
be
many
reasons
why...
we're...
we--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
and
what...
but
the
definition
of
the
term
was
a
responsibility
vested
in
congress,
because
it
has
the
power...
the
legislative
history
of
the
1998
act
itself
suggests
what
was
going
on
here
and
suggests
why
the
framers
gave
this
authority
to
congress.
there
were
numerous
hearings,
there
were
testimony
by
the
folks
that
represent
the
same
position
as
petitioners
here
as
to
why
this
shouldn't
be
done,
why
it
should
be
done.
congress
weighed...
as
this
court,
the
phrase
that
this
court
used,
i
think
it
was
in
the
feist
case,
the
delicate
balance
that
was
so
difficult
for
congress
to--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the...
as
we
described
in
our
brief,
in
pages
34
through
36,
i
believe
it
is
in
our
brief,
that
the
concerns
about
the
limitation
on
exploitation
and
the
limitation
of
a
copyright
period
in
europe
is
based
upon
the
country
of
origin
of
the
work
and
the
shortest
time
available.
so
that
there
may
be
differences,
and
we
describe
that,
but
that
illustrates,
justice
breyer,
the
difference
between
1
cents
and
10
cents
and
$100
with
respect
to
this
particular
author
who's
this
particular
age,
or
a
particular
author
like
melville,
whose
works
weren't...
weren't...
didn't...
or
schubert,
whose
works
weren't
properly
appreciated
or
exploitable
until
many
years
after
their
death.
all
of
these
variations
are
quintessentially
legislative
judgments.
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
framers
to
have
eschewed
deciding
14
years
was
a
constitutional
limitation,
and
for
this
court
to
say
99
years
is,
and
again,
even
the
petitioners
aren't
asking
the
court
to
make
that
judgment.
the
petitioners
are
only
saying
that
there
shall
be
a
per
se
rule
that
the
word
"limited
times"
means
unchangeable
times.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
issue
before
this
court,
i
hasten
to
say,
as
i
said
before,
is
only
whether,
once
the
congress
makes
that
judgment,
it
can
ever
change
it
retrospectively.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
whether,
in
the
future,
a
certain
length
of
time
would
be
appropriate.
that...
but
the
answer
to
that,
justice
ginsburg,
i
submit,
is
found
in
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
and
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
as
to
the
extent
that
this
court
would
find
or
not
find
that
the
judgment
made
by
congress
with
respect
to
the
implementation
of
this
very
broad
power
is
convenient
or
useful
in
terms
of
the
achievement
of
the
goals.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
is
among
our
arguments,
justice
souter.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
an
argument
that
we
have
made
and
articulated
in
the
brief--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
unless
there
is
a...
the
court
is...
because
the
circumstances
change,
that
we
are
living
in
an
era
now
where
piracy
is
a
significant
problem,
there's
question
of
administrative
ease,
of
administering
a
system
where
copyrights
may
be
different
for
one
set
of
authors,
or
different
for
another
set
of
authors,
there's
changes
that
are
taking
place
internationally,
so
that
what
we're
saying
is
that
not
only
could
this
court
conceive
of
reasons
why
congress
thought
it
was
accomplishing
the
objectives
of
this
clause,
but
that
there
are
numerous
objectives
that
are
entirely
legitimate
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
justice
scalia,
and
the
examples
that
are--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
implicit
promise
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
that's
not
an
unreasonable
expectation
at
all,
justice
stevens,
because
that
was
the
premise
of
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
you
could
arguably...
you
could
conceivably
make
that
argument,
justice
souter,
but
there
is
a
bright
line
there.
something
that
has
already
gone
into
the
public
domain,
which
other
individuals
or
companies
or
entities
may
then
have
acquired
an
interest
in,
or
rights
to,
or
be
involved
in
disseminating--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--this
is
a
rational--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--oh,
i
concede
that
it's
a
bright
line,
but
it's
a
bright
line
that
would
have--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--congress--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
agree,
and
this
court
has...
we're
not
just
talking
about
the
judgment
of
the
congress
of
the...
the
105th
congress
in
1998.
this
is
the
way
the
statute
of
anne
was
written.
this
is
the
way
the
state
copyright
laws
were
written
when
this
country
became
a
nation.
this
is
the
way
the
1790
copyright
statute,
the
number
of--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there
was
an
interest
in
having
a
uniform
rule,
and
that's
precisely
why
the
framers
created
the
copyright
clause
in
the
constitution,
but
there
was
copyright
protection
in
some
states,
there
wasn't
copyright
protection
in
other
states,
and
what
we
know
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
wheaton
decision
is
that
there
was
not
a
common
law
copyright
in
existence.
this
court
explicitly
held
that.
now,
the
petitioners
make
this
quid
pro
quo
argument
that
somehow
implicitly
the
initial
1790
copyright
statute
was
saying
to
people,
you
get
a
copyright
if
you
exchange
whatever
existing
rights
you
have.
that
simply
does
not
make
any
sense.
there
is
no
language,
and
it's
a
relatively
late-discovered
argument,
because
it
sees
its
full--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
wasn't
finished,
but
i'm
happy
to
come
back.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
was
going
to
say
there's
no
language
whatsoever
of
preemption,
abandonment,
abrogation,
or
exchange
in
the
1790
copyright,
but
compare...
copyright
act.
but
compare
that
to
the
1793
patent
act
under
the
same
clause,
where
there
is
that
exchange
there.
the
other
thing,
as
this
court
has
said,
there
is
no
implied
abrogation
of
common
law
rights
which
would
be
a
doctrine
which
would
be
inconsistent
with
what
the
petitioner
is
arguing.
now--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--justice
breyer,
it's
conceivable
that
the
court
might
do
that
if
that
situation
was
present,
but
it's
not
remotely
the
situation
here.
we
have
the
adoption
of
copyright
terms
which
are
consistent,
generally
speaking,
with
copyright
terms
which
exist
in
the
european
union,
our
principal
competitor,
and
in
connection
with
international
treaties.
we
have
a
copyright
term
that's
consistent
with
the
concept
of
the
creator
plus
the
creator's
first
generation
heirs.
we
have
a
copyright
term,
remember,
which
supersedes
the
earlier
copyright
provisions
that
were
added
to
the
period
between
creation
and
publication,
so
that
the
limited
number
of
years
in
the
first,
the
1790
and
the
1831
statute
were
the
number
of
years
plus
the
relatively
unlimited
period
of
time
between
creation
and
publication,
so
we
don't
have
anything
remotely
like
that
in
this
situation.
we
have
a
process
which,
as
you
suggested,
or
one
of
the
questions
suggested,
is...
may
not
have
been
the
policy
that
you
as
a
member
of
congress
would
have
supported.
you
might
have
made
the
balance,
that
delicate
balance
that
this
court
has
referred
to,
in
another
way,
but
that
is
something
that
congress,
through
its
ability
to
gather
facts
and
make
balances,
is
quintessentially
capable
of
doing,
and
that
is
where
the
framers
vested
the
responsibility,
and
what
this
statute
does
is
to
favor,
if
at
all,
the
creator
with
respect
to
the
utilization
of
these
rights,
as
opposed
to
the
person
who
wishes
to
copy
the
creator.
that's
an
entirely
rational
distinction
for
congress
to
make.
thank
you.
