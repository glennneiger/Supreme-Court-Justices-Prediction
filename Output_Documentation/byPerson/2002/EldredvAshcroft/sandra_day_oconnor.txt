mr.
lessig,
i'll
tell
you
what
bothers
me
about
your
position,
and
that
is
that
congress
has
extended
the
term
so
often
through
the
years,
and
if
you
are
right,
don't
we
run
the
risk
of
upsetting
previous
extensions
of
time?
i
mean,
this
seems
to
be
a
practice
that
began
with
the
very
first
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
have
been
a
number
of
extensions
since.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
you
can
get
over
the
first
hurdle.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
court
really
has
not...
if
you
say
that
the
copyright
clause
is
not
violated,
i
don't
think
there
are
examples
where
this
court
has
then
resorted
to
first
amendment
analysis
to
invalidate
the
same
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
this
would
be
quite
a
new
proposition.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
the
framers
seem
to
have
adopted
these
two
things
at
the
same
time--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
think
there
are
not
examples
that
i
can
think
of
where
we
have
said,
well,
we'll
analyze
it
under
the
copyright
clause,
but
if
that
fails
we'll
turn
to
the
first
amendment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
it
has
expanded
very
much,
and
they
also
envisioned
a
very
short
term,
and
i
can
find
a
lot
of
fault
with
what
congress
did
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--because
it
does
take
a
lot
of
things
out
of
the
public
domain
that
one
would
think
that
someone
in
congress
would
want
to
think
hard
about.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
having
done
that,
it's
very
difficult
to
find
the
basis
in
the
constitution
for
saying
it
isn't
a
limited
term.
it's
longer
than
one
might
think
desirable--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
is
it
not
limited?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
rule
against
perpetuities
might
jump
in
there
at
some
point.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
could
agree
with
you,
in
terms
of
policy,
that
this
flies
directly
in
the
face
of
what
the
framers
had
in
mind,
absolutely.
but
does
it
violate
the
constitution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
is
hard
to
understand
how,
if
the
overall
purpose
of
the
copyright
clause
is
to
encourage
creative
work,
how
some
retroactive
extension
could
possibly
do
that.
i...
one
wonders
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
congress,
even
if
somehow
they
didn't
violate
the
clause.
but
if
we
affirm
here,
is
there
any
limiting
principle
out
there
that
would
ever
kick
in?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
it's
a
limited
term,
as
the
constitution
says,
is
there
indeed
any
limit
out
there?
