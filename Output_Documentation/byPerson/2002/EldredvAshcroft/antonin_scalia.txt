justice
antonin
scalia
general
olson,
you
say
that
the
functional
equivalent
of
an
unlimited
time
would
be
a
violation,
but
that's
precisely
the
argument
that's
being
made
by
petitioners
here,
that
a
limited
time
which
is
extendable
is
the
functionable,
functional
equivalent
of
an
unlimited
time,
a
limited
time
that
10
years
from
now
can
be
extended,
and
then
extended
again,
and
extended
again.
why...
their
argument
is
precisely
that,
a
limited
time
doesn't
mean
anything
unless
it
means,
once
you
have
established
the
limit
for
works
that
have
been
created
under
that
limit,
that's
the
end.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
also
argue
that
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
alone
will
justify
the
retroactive
extension
simply
as
a
matter
of
equity?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is,
that
the
copyright
clause
justifies
the
extension
for
works
not
yet
created,
but
it
would
be
enormously
inequitable
to
have
other
authors
who
put
in
the
same
amount
of
work
get
a
lesser
protection,
so
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
now
allows
you
to
do
the
retrospective?
