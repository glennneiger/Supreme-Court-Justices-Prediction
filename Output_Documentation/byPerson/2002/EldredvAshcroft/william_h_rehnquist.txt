h.

we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
01-618,
eric
eldred
v.
john
d.
ashcroft.
mr.
lessig.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
that
itself
mean
something,
mr.
lessig?
the
fact
that
they
were
never
challenged,
perhaps
most
people,
and
perhaps
everybody
felt
there
was
no
basis
for
challenging
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
talking
about
court
challenges,
not
academic
challenges.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
want
more
than
that.
you
want
the
right
to
copy
verbatim
other
people's
books,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
certainly
what
is
happening
in
the
country
today
in
the
way
of
congressional...
under
the
commerce
clause
is
totally
different
than
what
the
framers
had
in
mind,
but
we've
never
felt
that
that
was
the
criterion.
what
the
framers
thought
of,
there
weren't
steamboats,
there
weren't
railroads.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
said
there
was
a
general
grant,
and
that
congress
was
free
to
run
with
it
in
many
respects.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lessig.
general
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
congress
says
we're
going
to
grant
this
copyright
indefinitely,
forever--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
violates
the
limited
term,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
olson.
mr.
lessig,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lessig.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-618,
eldred
against
ashcroft
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
