justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
ask
you
about
one
of
the
limits,
just
focusing
on
the
copyright
clause
and
the
progress
of
science
and
useful
arts?
in
your
view,
does
that...
is
that
limited
to
encouraging
creativity
by
authors
and
inventors,
or
does
it
also
include
the
distribution
of
materials
that
might
not
otherwise
be
distributed,
like
old
films
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
the
quid
pro
quo
is
that
we
can
facilitate
distribution
of
some
old
film
by
an
additional
monopoly
grant,
you'd
think
that's
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
take
one
of
the
early
extensions,
just
extending
a...
an
already
granted
patent
to
an
inventor
for
an
extra
10
years.
how
can
that
be
squared
with
the
language
of
the
provision?
maybe
congress
did
it,
but
maybe
it
acted
improperly
when
it
did
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
our
question,
really.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
view
it
as
entirely
a
grant,
or
do
you
think
it
also
contains
limitations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
do
you...
i'd
be
interested
in
knowing,
do
you
think
it
does
contain
limitations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
did
the
example
we
just
talked
about,
a
patentee
giving
an
extra
10
years
on
his...
how
does
that
promote
the
progress
of
science?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
concentrating
on
our
patentee,
and
i'm
wondering
how
that
fits
into
the
notion
that
there
was
a
bargain
in
effect
between
the
inventor
and
the
government
that
at
a
certain
period
of
time
it
would
become
part
of
the
public
domain.
it
seems
to
me
it's
inconsistent
with
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the
reason
for
the
right
in
the
first
place
was
to
encourage
invention.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
argument
would
apply
to
new
copyrights,
but
to
extension
of
already
existing
copyrights
your
argument
doesn't
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
work
has
already
been
created.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
for
them,
they
get
the
benefit
of
the
longer
term
if
you
don't
apply
it
to
an
existing
copyright.
i
mean,
if
you
say
you
need
70
years
because
of
changes
in
the
economy
to
encourage
works,
you
grant
70
for
the
future,
but
why
does
that,
making
that
apply
to
somebody
who
created
his
work
20
years
ago
and
has
already
provided
what
he,
the
quid
pro
quo,
why
do
you
need
it
for
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
constitution
refers
to
the
authors
and
the
inventors,
doesn't
it?
they're
certainly
the
prime
actors
in
this
scene,
aren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
it
gets
into
the
public
domain
at
the
expiration
of
the
term.
that
was
an
important
part
of
the
bargain.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you,
why
is
it
enormously
inequitable
if
they
get
exactly
what
they
were
entitled
to
at
the
time
they
made
the
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
they
have
some
right
to
expect
that
they
will
be...
you
know,
an
additional
grant,
later
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
difficulty--
--if
we're
just
looking
for
a
bright
line,
the
line
that
they
suggest
between
unexpired
patents
and
copyrights
and
brand
new
ones
is
also
just
as
bright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
the
original
statute
was
replacing
a
bunch
of
state
statutes
or
state
rules,
partly
common
law,
partly
statutory,
that...
they
had
kind
of
a
mixed
up
legal
situation,
and
there
was
an
interest
in
having
one
uniform
rule
for
the
first
time
around.
