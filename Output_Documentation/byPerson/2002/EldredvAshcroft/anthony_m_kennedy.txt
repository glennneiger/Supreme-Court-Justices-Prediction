well,
i
suppose
implicit
in
the
argument
that
the
'76
act,
too,
should
have
been
declared
void,
and
that
we
might
leave
it
alone
because
of
the
disruption,
is
that
for
all
these
years
the
act
has
impeded
progress
in
science
and
the
useful
arts.
i
just
don't
see
any
empirical
evidence
for
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
perhaps
i
misunderstood.
i
thought
the
whole
thrust
of
your
argument
was
that
there
is
a
great
first
amendment
force
here
that's
being
silenced,
that's
being
thwarted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
that's
the
whole
underpinning
of
your
case.

in
victorian
england
you
could
buy
a
box
seat
for
900
years.
there
was
serene
complacency
about
their
culture,
and
god
bless
them,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
really
think
this
is
an
important
question
and,
as
justice
o'connor
points
out,
if
we
have
to
ask
what's
the
most
plausible
explanation
for
this
rule,
to
reward
existing
vested
interest
or
to
stimulate
new
works,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
probably
the
former.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
we
know
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why?
why
not?
