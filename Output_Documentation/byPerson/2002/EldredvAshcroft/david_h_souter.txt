mr.
lessig,
your
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
regardless
of
changed
circumstances
or
not,
your
basic
theory,
which
on
your
argument
would
have
been
appropriate
at
any
time
historically,
is
that
there
has
at
least
got
to
be
the
possibility
of
a
kind
of
a
causal
connection
between
the
extension
and
the
promotion
or
inducement
for
the
creation
of
some
subsequent
work,
but
why
is
that
any
more
plausible
a
reading
of
the
promotion
clause
than
simply
a
reading
that
says
the
promotion
clause
requires
that
there
be
a
general
scheme
in
place,
which
overall
tends
to
promote
or
induce,
and
part
of
one
aspect
of
that
scheme
can
be
that
the...
that
at
the
discretion
of
congress
the
period
of
protection
is
extended
from
time
to
time?
why
do
you
require...
why
do
you
say
the
clause
has
got
to
be
read
by
this
kind
of
specific
causation
theory
as
opposed
to
a
kind
of
systemic
theory
of
promotion?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's...
i
mean,
that's
the
issue
in
the
alternative
reading.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
why
is
it
a
limit
case,
rather
than
a
discretion
within
a
general
scheme
kind--
justice
david
h.
souter
--of
clause?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
if
you
accept
the
copyright
clause
argument,
then
you
have
a
way,
in
effect,
of
devaluing
the
government's
claim
of
its
important
interest
and
important
objective
when
you
get
to
the
first
amendment
intermediate
scrutiny
analysis.
whereas
if
you
don't
accept
the
copyright
clause
claim,
then,
in
order
to
make
the
first
amendment
analysis
we've
simply
got
to
say,
well,
gee,
is
the
promotion
of
useful
art
and
so
on
more
important
than
the
public
domain,
and
can
we
say
that
that
allows
a
distinction
between
50
years
and
70
years?
we're
pretty
much
at
sea,
so
i
thought
your
copyright
clause
argument
was
necessary
to
give
us
some
handle
with
which
to
deal
with
the
first
amendment.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
let's
assume
we
don't...
for
the
sake
of
argument
here,
let's
assume
we
don't
accept
the
copyright
clause
argument.
do
you
have
an
independent
first
amendment
argument
in
your
brief?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and
it
is...
tell
me
in
a
sentence
or
two
what
it
is.
i
mean,
at
that
point
i'm
where
justice
ginsburg
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's
the
copyright
clause
argument,
and
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying,
okay,
we
then
apply
that
in
first
amendment
analysis,
which
allows
us
to
make
a
coherent
intermediate
scrutiny
argument.
if
we
don't
accept
the
copyright
clause
retrospectivity
argument--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
what
is
your
first
amendment
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the
difference...
the
reason
that
analogy
doesn't
cut
it
for
me
is
that
the
limited
edition
print
depends
basically
on
an
implied
understanding
between
the
person
who
makes
the
print
and
the
person
who
buys
it,
and
the
understanding
is,
you
won't
go
beyond
100,
or
whatever
number
you
write.
we're
not
engaged
in
a
contractual
analysis
under
the
copyright
clause
between
the
writer
and
the...
and
somebody
representing
the
public
domain.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
analogy
doesn't
seem
to
work.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
assuming--
justice
david
h.
souter
--with
the
exception
of
a
limitation
which
illustrates
the
distinction
between
forever
on
the
one
hand
and
a
definite
number
on
the
other,
is
there
any
limitation
in
the
clause?
does
the
promotion,
does
the
preambular
recitation
of
promotion
as
such
place
a
limit
on
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
but
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and
is
your
argument
that
we
should
so
find
and
hold
against
their
retrospective
argument,
because
there
is
some,
at
least
plausible
basis
to
say
that
there
can
be
a
causal
connection
between
the
retrospective
extension
and
some
benefit
that
can
be
traced
to
those
particular
works
through
the
retrospective
extension,
like
dissemination?
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
also
your
argument
that
even
if
you
cannot
trace
that
kind,
or
at
least
plausibly
argue
that
there
could
be
that
kind
of
a
causal
benefit,
that
it
would
still
be
constitutional,
because
you
should
judge
the
extension
simply
as
contributing
to
a
general
system,
one
feature
of
which
is
that
from
time
to
time
there
may
be
retrospective
extensions,
and
so
long
as
that
general
system
induces
the
creation
of
works,
or
the
dissemination
of
works,
or
the
preservation
of
works,
so
long
as
the
general
system
works,
there
is
no
review,
no
limitation
on
the
tinkering
that
can
be
done,
even
retrospectively?
is
that
also
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
wouldn't
it?
if
the
equity
argument
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
justifies
extension
of
the
copyright
for
those
whose
copyright
will
expire
tomorrow
if
it's
not
extended,
in
order
to
put
them
on
parity
with
those
getting
copyrights
for
new
works,
why
doesn't
it
apply
to
the
copyright,
the
holder
of
the
copyright
that
expired
yesterday?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
you
don't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
you
don't
throw
out
a
line
there,
then
ben
jonson
certainly
gets
recopyrighted.
justice
david
h.
souter
except
congress
chose
this
one
and
didn't
choose
the
other
one.
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--basically
you're
saying
the
presumption
ought
to
be
in
the
congressional
judgment
about
how
to
draw
the
line
as
well
as
in
how
long
a
line
to
draw.
