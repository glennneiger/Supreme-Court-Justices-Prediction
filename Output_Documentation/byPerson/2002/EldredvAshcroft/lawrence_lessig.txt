mr.
lawrence
lessig
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
are
before
you
this
morning
challenging
congress's
1998
sonny
bono
copyright
term
extension
act,
which
extended
the
term
of
subsisting
and
future
copyrights
by
20
years.
petitioners
submit
such
a
blanket
extension
of
existing
terms
exceeds
congress's
power
under
the
copyright
clause
and
it
violates
the
first
amendment.
now,
the
government
has
responded
to
petitioners'
argument
in
a
way
that
betrays
a
simple
but
fundamental
confusion.
the
government
has
argued
as
if
petitioners
had
advanced
a
general
theory
of
the
copyright
clause,
or
a
general
constraint
under
which
congress
must
operate.
that
is
a
mistake.
this
case
is
about
limits
to
an
enumerated
power.
it's
not
about
general
power
of
congress
to
exercise
its
copyright
authority.
petitioners
have
advanced
a
particular
interpretation
of
the
only
express
limits
in
the
copyright
clause
designed
to
give
those
limits
meaning.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
justice,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
very
first
act
extended
terms
at
all.
speaking
technically,
which
for
a
lawyer
means
speaking
accurately,
the
1790
act
did
not
extend
a
federal
term.
the
1790
act
granted
a
term
for
works
that
already
existed
in
precisely
the
pattern
that
the
english
parliament
had
done
in
the
statute
of
anne
in
1710,
and
that
the
english
parliament
did
with
monopolies,
general
monopolies
in
the
statute
of--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
that's
right.
that's
the
important
hurdle,
and
we'd
like
to
jump
that
first,
but
the
other
ones,
justice,
you're
right,
in
1831
and
in
1909
congress
extended
terms
in
a
way
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
strongest
form
of
the
test
that
we
have
advanced.
those
extensions,
however,
were
never
challenged
in
any
court
and
certainly
not
considered
by
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
absolutely
true
that
this
case
is
here
because
of
a
fundamentally
important
changed
circumstance
that
makes
the
framers'
limitations
on
the
copyright
clause
much
more
significant.
this
is
the
first
time
i
can
remember
where
this
court
has
been
pointed
to
changed
circumstances
as
a
reason
to
reaffirm
the
framers'
values,
because
for
most
of
this
period,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
only
people
who
were
regulated
by
copyright
law
under
the
copyright
act
would
have
been
commercial
publishers,
primarily,
and
now
for
the
first
time
the
scope
of
this
exclusive
right
has
expanded
because
of
the
changed
technology
of
the
internet
to
reach
an
extraordinarily
broad
range
of
creativity
that
never
would
have
been
imagined
before.
now,
it's
not
the
case
that
the
earlier
extensions
were
not
questioned
on
constitutional
grounds.
in
fact,
melville
nimmer,
in
the
consideration
of
the
1976
act,
suggested
they
were
plainly
under--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--that's
right,
there
is
no
court
challenge.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
justice
souter,
the
reason
is
exactly
related
to
the
point
i
began
with,
that
this
is
a
case
about
limits
and
not
about
discretion.
if
it's
not
the
case
that
this
court--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
because
if
this
court
does
not
adopt
a
reading
of
the
form
we've
offered,
then
there
is
no
limit
to
the
ability
of
congress
to
extend
subsisting
terms.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
yes.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
i--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--i...
no,
justice
ginsburg,
we
would
not,
and
the
reason
is
again
related
to
the
method
we
have
adopted
to
interpret
"limited
times".
we
have
not
said
that
"promote
the
progress
of
science"
is
a
general
and
independent
constraint
on
the
copyright
clause
authority.
we've
said
it
must
be
looked
to
to
interpret
the
scope
of
"limited
times",
and
unless
retrospective
extensions
are
forbidden,
it
will
eviscerate
the
meaning
of
"limited
times".
that
does
not
occur
in
the
context
of
the
scope
of
exclusive
right,
nor
in
the
context
of
the
power
to
secure.
if
that's--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--justice
breyer,
under
our
theory
as
we've
advanced
it,
you're
right;
the
1976
act
would
be
unconstitutional.
whether
this
court
would
apply
such
a
holding
in
this
case
to
that
act
is
a
question
that
would
have
to
be
resolved
under
the
retrospective--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--justice,
the
theory,
which
would
advance
the
aim
of
limiting
times
in
a
way
that
is
enforceable,
is
only
applicable
in
the
case
that
we
brought
before
you
here
to
the
'98
act,
and
would
not
necessarily
be
applicable
under
the
'76
act
for
the
reasons
the
government
has
offered.
we
would
not
advance
this
argument,
but
the
government
has
offered
an
argument
in
a
parallel
case
that
suggests
a
distinction
between
the
'76
act
and
this
case.
that's
not
been
briefed
here.
it's
been
grounded
in
their
claim
that
the
treaty
power
creates
some
special
power.
we
wouldn't
advance
that
claim,
but
the
point
is
there
are
a
number
of
issues
that
the
'76
act--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--that's
certainly
true,
and
we
also
believe
that,
for
the
reasons
averted
to
by
amicus
aol
in
this
case
and
the
reasons
you've
just
suggested,
the
disruption
in
that
context
under
the
retrospectivity
cases
ryder
and
reynolds
casketville
company
would
be
sufficient
to
fit
it
within
the,
quote,
"severe
disruption
exception"
to
the
retrospectivity.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
justice,
we
are
not
making
an
empirical
claim
at
all.
nothing
in
our
copyright
clause
claim
hangs
upon
the
empirical
assertion
about
impeding
progress.
our
only
argument
is,
this
is
a
structural
limit
necessary
to
assure
that
what
would
be
an
effectively
perpetual
term
not
be
permitted
under
the
copyright
laws.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
well,
the
thrust
certainly--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--it's
certainly
the
case
that
we
are
asserting,
in
light
of
the
changed
circumstances,
that
the
opportunity
to
build
upon
works
within
the
public
domain
is
a
fundamental
first
amendment
interest,
and
that
the
first
amendment
values,
the
vital
speech
interest
at
stake
of
this
case,
is
that
the
public
domain
be
permitted
as
a
source
for
cultivating
work
about
our
culture
without
unnecessary
legal
restriction.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
we
want
the
right
to
copy
verbatim
works
that
should
be
in
the
public
domain
and
would
be
in
the
public
domain
but
for
a
statute
that
cannot
be
justified
under
ordinary
first
amendment
analysis
or
under
a
proper
reading
of
the
limits
built
into
the
copyright
clause.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
justice,
we've
argued
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
in
this
case
for
the
court
to
consider
the
prospective
line
until
they
decide
whether
the
case,
whether
the
prospective
and
retrospective
is
severable,
and
we
submit
it's
an
easy
case
to
show
that
it's
not.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
yes.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
that's
right.
i--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--well,
the
strongest
first
amendment
argument
is
about
the
retrospective
extension,
because
of
a
fundamental
change
that
occurs
when
congress
extends
subsisting
copyrights,
rather
than
when
congress
legislates
prospectively.
when
congress
legislates
prospectively,
it
has
no
way
to
know
who's
going
to
benefit
from
its
extension.
it
is
simply
evaluating
what
the
term
should
be
prospectively
in
a
way
that
we
presume
this
court
should
presume
is
legitimate
under
the
first
amendment.
when
it
legislates
retrospectively,
it
is,
in
effect,
looking
at
particular
authors
and
estates
of
authors
who
are
before
congress
asking
for
this
extension,
and
it's
choosing
between
these
particular
authors
and
the
public
at
large.
now,
it
may
be
that
in
exercising
that
choice
in
this
case,
congress
made
an
objective
valuation
of
who
would
be
in
the
best
position
to
advance
the
interests
of
promoting
the
progress
of
science,
or
any--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--well,
the
line
comes
from
deciding
what
the
first
amendment
interest
is,
and
if
this
court
heed
the
first
amendment
interest
off
of
this
difference
between
selecting
who
gets
the
benefit
of
20
years
of
extension
and
just
simply
legislating
in
a
general
way
prospectively,
then
this
court
could
hold,
with
respect
to
the
prospective,
that
it's
not
even
necessary
to
raise
the
intermediate
scrutiny
in
that
context,
but
again,
for
ashwander
reasons
we
don't
think
that
this
court
should
address
the
prospective
aspect
of
the
ctea
even
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
well,
justice,
that
certainly
is
the
reason
the
government
offers
for
this
pattern.
it,
of
course,
doesn't
explain
actually
what
congress
has
done
and,
even
in
this
case,
when
a
work
has
passed
into
the
public
domain,
then
there
is
precisely
the
same
week
before/week
after
problem
that
you
advert
to,
that
extension
does
not
extend
to
all
subsisting
works,
it
only
extends
to
all
subsisting
copyrights.
so
that
line
is
already
drawn
in
the
practice
that
congress
has
adopted,
but
our
point
is,
the
only
way
to
assure--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--well,
in
1831
it
did
not.
in
1831
it
granted
the
benefit
of
its
extension
to
a
subset
of
all
subsisting
copyright
holders.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
in
1976--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--that's
absolutely
right,
yes.
so
they
have
extended
it
to
both.
but
our
argument
is,
unless
this
court
draws
a
line
about
this
extension,
then
for
the
reasons
judge
sentelle
suggested
below,
there
will
be
no
limit
to
congress's
ability
to--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
yes.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
yes.
precisely...
actually,
we're
not
saying
anything
about
the
70
years
in
this
case
even
under
the
first
amendment,
because
we
believe
it's
unseverable,
but--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--our
copyright
clause
argument
is
certainly
a
way
of
framing
why
extensions
of
subsisting
terms
cannot
be
seen
to
promote
the
first
amendment
interest
of
speech
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
yes,
of
course
we
do.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
yes.
the
first
amendment
argument
we've
argued
in
our
brief
is
with
respect
to
the
retrospective
extension,
and
the
first
amendment
argument
is,
that
needs
to--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
that's
right,
i'm
sorry,
justice.
what
i'm
saying
is
not
that
it's
the
retrospectivity
that
makes
the
first
amendment
argument
troubling...
i
mean,
that
drives
our
first
amendment
argument.
all
i'm
saying
is,
we
have
addressed
the
retrospective
portion
of
ctea,
and
so
i'm
saying
in
the
retrospective
portion
of
ctea
you
would
apply
ordinary,
intermediate
first
amendment
review,
and
we
would
ask--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--well--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--well,
justice
o'connor,
the
first
amendment
is
always
an
independent
limitation
on
what
otherwise
would
be
legitimate
exercises
of
congressional
authority,
so
this--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
that's
right,
and
if--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--justice,
that's
right.
if
only
we
had
the
framers'
copyright
before
us,
because
of
course,
again
remember,
the
exclusive
right
the
framers
spoke
of
was
the
right
to
print
and
publish.
it
didn't
include
the
derivative
rights,
it
didn't
include
the
display
rights,
and
it
certainly--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
right.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
well,
if
it
is
limited,
then
there
is
no
limit
to
the
ability
of
congress
to
extend
subsisting
terms,
and
that
fundamentally
destroys
the
objective
that
the--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--right,
and
we
submit
the
framers
had
something
very
different
in
mind
than
the
rule
against
perpetuities.
the
point
is,
if
this
is
permitted,
then
there
is
no
limit
to
the
ability
to
extend
terms,
and
that
is
precisely
contrary
to
what
the
framers
had
in
mind
when
they
worried
about
this
problem
originally.
what
was
the
problem
they
were
solving?
it
was,
as
this
court
stated
in
graham--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--well,
if
it
flies
in
the
face
of
what
the
framers
had
in
mind,
then
the
question
is,
is
there
a
way
of
interpreting
their
words
that
gives
effect
to
what
they
had
in
mind,
and
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
in
many
respects,
mr.
chief
justice,
but,
as
this
court
has
also
said,
there
are
limits
to
what
congress
can
do
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
we're
happy
to
adopt
a
broader
interpretation
of
what
promote
the
progress
is
about,
within
the
general
framework
that
the
framers
established
in
light
of
the
english
practice,
which
was
a
quid
pro
quo.
the
ability
to
facilitate
distribution--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--so
long
as
the
grant
is
conditioned
upon
the
distribution.
so
long
as
the
grant--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--no,
that's
the
view
of
the
government's,
justice
breyer.
my
view
is--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--no.
what
we
were
saying
is,
if
congress
wants
to
permit
restoration
of
films,
for
example,
an
issue
that's
been
well
briefed
here,
congress
can
say,
if
you
restore
the
film,
then
the
restoration
gets
a
copyright
so
long
as
it
satisfies
originality
as
outlined
in
feist,
and
it
gets
a
copyright
for
a
period
of
time.
but
this
court's
opinion
in
graham
and
in
feist
made
clear
that
it
could
not
extend
copyrights
to
works
in
the
public
domain.
the
government
doesn't
concede
that,
but
we
stand
on
that
as
a
way
of
understanding
why
this
court--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--no.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
they
cannot
give
a
copyright
purely
for
purposes
of
distribution
to
publishers.
[laughter]
they
would
need
to
satisfy
all
of
the
implied
limitations
that
this
court
has
expressed
in
the
context
of
this,
the
most
carefully
limited
clause
in
article
i,
section
8.
it
is
one
of
the--
mr.
lawrence
lessig
--justice
ginsburg,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
objective
of
harmonization
fitting
within
the
"promote
the
progress
of
science"
understanding,
subject
to
constitutional
limitations.
if
france
adopted
a
rule
that
said
you
couldn't
grant
copyrights
to
hate
speech,
we
could
not
harmonize
with
that
rule
consistent
with
our
first
amendment
and
similarly,
as
mary
beth
peters
testified
before
congress,
ours
is
the
only
constitution
that
has
an
express
limitation
on
terms.
that's
got
to
mean
something,
and
if
it
means
that
we
are
limited
in
our
ability
to
agree
with
the
europeans
as
they
continually
expand
the
term
in
light
of
their
own
vision
of
what
copyright
is
about,
then
that's
the
meaning
of
a
constitutional
restriction.
this
court's
interpretation
of
"limited
times"
could,
of
course,
eviscerate
that
term
of
any
meaning,
but
under
the
principle
of
enumeration
as
this
court
has
articulated
it,
this
court
should
interpret
that
clause
in
a
way
that
gives
its
terms
effect
in
a
simple
way.
just
as
a
limited
addition
print
is
not
a
limited...
is
not
limited
if
each
time
a
customer
comes
in
a
new
print
is
printed,
so,
too,
a
limited
term
is
not
limited
if
each
time
copyright
holders
come
to
congress
they
can
extend
the
term.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
that's
right.
all
that
i'm
suggesting
is,
here
is
a
plain
meaning
of
the
term
that
gives
effect
to
the
constitutional
limit
in
a
way
that
assures
that,
in
fact,
the
limit
is
respected,
contrary
to
the
government's
argument,
which,
in
effect,
permits
congress
the
power
perpetually
to
extend
terms.
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
lessig
general
olson
has
been
perfectly
clear
in
setting
out
the
structure
of
the
government's
argument.
it
is
that
there
is
no
effective
limit
on
congress's
power
under
the
copyright
clause.
now,
were
this
the
first
time
this
court
had
considered
congress's
copyright
authority,
that
might
be
a
plausible
argument,
but
the
very
first
time
this
court
ever
struck
down
a
law
of
congress
as
exceeding
article
i,
section
8
power
was
in
the
context
of
the
copyright
clause.
we
have
125
years
of
history
of
this
court
making
sure
that
the
limits,
both
express
and
implied,
in
the
copyright
clause,
have
some
meaning.
the
feist
opinion
very
clearly
sets
out
the
implied
limits,
a
per
se
limit
for
originality,
for
the
reasons
justice
breyer
was
trying
to
get
me
to
say.
the
harper
as
well
as
graham
set
out
very
clear
limits
on
the
context
of
the
ability
to
extend
works
in
the
public
domain.
those
limits
make
no
sense
under
the
reasoning
the
government
has
offered.
the
government's
reasoning
would
make
all
of
those
opinions
irrelevant
and
wrong.
now,
we
offer
a
simple
way
to
make
this
clear,
express
limit
make
sense,
and
that
is
precisely
the
understanding
we
suggest
that
existed
in
1790.
the
only
precedents
that
existed
in
1790
were
precedents
of
setting
a
term,
and
then
when
parliament
was
asked
in
1735,
'37,
and
'39
to
extend
it,
they
rejected
it,
and
as
amicus
historians
said,
they
rejected
it
because,
as
a
pamphleteer
described
it,
that
would
be
effectively
a
perpetual
term.
now,
this
delicate
balance
that
the
government
invokes,
justice
breyer,
let
me
give
you
the
numbers.
the
delicate
balance
is
that,
under
the
most
reasonable
assumptions
of
copyright
royalty
income
and
under
our
interest
rate
of
7
percent,
as
the
amicus
economists
note
at
page
6,
note
6
of
their
brief,
the
current
term
gives
authors
99.8
percent
of
the
value
of
a
perpetual
term.
now,
that
might
be
a
delicate
balance,
that
they
give
the
author
99.8
percent
and
the
public.2
percent,
but
in
my
mind,
that's
delicate
in
a
very
different
sense
of
that
term.
thank
you
very
much.
