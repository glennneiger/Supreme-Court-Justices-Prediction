justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
we
then
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question?
to
make
that
very
specific,
if
we
agree
with
you,
does
that
mean
that
we
would,
in
principle,
have
to
hold
the
1976
extension
unconstitutional?
i
mean,
in
1976,
congress
extended
the
term
from
28
years,
renewable
once,
to
life
of
the
author
plus
50
years.
now
they're
extending
it
life
of
the
author
plus
70.
if
the
latter
is
unconstitutional
on
your
theory,
how
could
the
former
not
be?
and
if
the
former
is,
the
chaos
that
would
ensue
would
be
horrendous.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
we
ought
to
find
another
theory,
then.
is
there
any--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
essence,
you
think
it's
at
least
arguable
that
the
'76
act
had
various
positive
aspects
to
it
in
terms
of
the
purpose
of
the
copyright
clause
that
this
act
lacks?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
isn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words
you
could
have...
right
now,
if
congress
decides
to
have
a
law,
and
this
law
is
going
to
give
copyrights
in
1)
the
bible,
2)
shakespeare,
3)
ben
jonson,
and
the
reason
they
do
it
is
that
they
think
that
that
would
lead
publishers
to
produce
those
and
distribute
them,
and
they're
right,
they
will,
okay?
in
your
view,
that's
perfectly
constitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
thought
that
was
the
question
you
were
getting,
and
i
thought
you
were
saying...
i
must
have
misunderstood.
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
was
constitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
is
no,
they
cannot
give
a
copyright
purely
for
purposes
of
dissemination
to
publishers,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
dissemination
alone?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
no,
not...
don't
say
not
necessarily.
i'm...
for
purposes
of
my
thinking
about
it,
i'd
like
to
know,
imagine
we
have
just
dissemination.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
correct.
the
only
justification
for
the
extension,
there
is
no
other,
is
dissemination
of
a
work
that
is
already
in
existence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
want
to
say,
do
you
think
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
your
opinion,
in
my
example,
if
you
recall
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--your
answer
would
be,
if
congress
tomorrow
wants
to
give
a
copyright
to
a
publisher
solely
for
the
purpose
of
reproducing
and
disseminating
ben
jonson,
shakespeare,
it
can
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
hate
to
say
may--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
that
really...
that's
an
important
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
let
me
explain
to
you
why
it's
important
to
me.
i
have
a
list.
this
is
an
economic
statute.
the
harms
that
seem
to
be
caused
by
it,
the
extension,
i've
listed
as
follows,
approximate
numbers,
made
up,
but
magnitude
correct.
the
existing
copyright
holders
who
survive,
their
copyright
survives
70
years,
who
have
already
been
paid,
on
the
numbers
that
were
given,
about
$24
billion
or
more,
will
receive
an
extra
$6
billion.
that,
i
take
it,
is
a
harm.
their
works
have
already
been
created.
harm
number
2.
the
fact
that
people,
for
the
99
percent
of
the
copyrights
that
have
no
commercial
value
after
70
years,
have
to
find
the
copyright
holder
to
put
them
in
databases.
the
cost
of
that,
on
my
numbers
in
here,
made
up,
at
least
a
billion
dollars,
or
they
can't
find
the
people
at
all
and
get
permission,
an
innumerable
cost,
un...
valuable
cost
to
people
who
want
to
use
it.
those
are
costs.
on
the
plus
side
i
see
uniformity,
dissemination,
and...
now,
you
tell
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uniformity.
that's
uniformity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
on
the
last
point,
it's...
i've
counted
that
as
zero.
the
reason
i've
counted
it
as
zero
is
it
seems
to
me
that
the
added
value,
incentive
value
to
produce
between
life
plus
50,
or
life
plus
70,
is
zero.
it's
carried
out,
as
the
economists
do,
to
three
decimal
points,
divide
by
100
for
the
probability
of
your
ever
having
such
a
work,
and
you
get
virtually
zero,
no
difference
between
this
and
a
perpetual
copyright.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in...
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
you
think,
say,
verdi,
othello,
verdi,
othello,
80
years
old,
the
prospect
of
an
extra
20
years
way
down
the
pike
would
have
made
a
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
weighs
in
that
balance,
because
to
go
back
for
one
second,
in
practical,
economic
terms
i
gather
the
difference
between
a
copyright
that
lasts
for
100
years,
lasts
for
1,000
years,
lasts
forever,
is
probably
something
less
than
1,000...
on
$1,000
a
penny.
i
mean,
it's
a
penny
on
1,000,
or
probably
a
lot
less
than
that,
frankly.
so
i
can
not
only
not
imagine
a
person
whose
decision
to
write
would
be
governed
by
such
a
thing,
i
cannot
imagine
a
european
who
would
come
to
america
to
copyright
his
work
for
such
a
reason.
indeed,
i
wonder
why
that
european
wouldn't
come
anyway,
even
if
the
term
were
10
years,
because
if
he
doesn't
come,
he's
not
going
to
get
protection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
who
are
these
people
that
are
going
to
be
moved
by
that
incentive?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
you
to
finish
that,
but
i
want
you
to
go
back
to
the...
i
have
one
question
on
the
equity
principle.
are
you...
i
want
you
to
finish.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
go
ahead.
no,
no,
you
finish
first.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
i
mean,
i
think
you
have
a
point
on
this
equity
principle.
i
wonder,
is
there
any
review
there?
that
is,
suppose
you
have
a
statute,
as
this
one
arguably
is,
where
99.9
percent,
many
billions
of
dollars
of
benefits,
are
going
to
the
existing
holders
of
copyright
on
grounds
of
equity,
and
the
effect
of
the
statute
in
eliciting
new
works
is
near
zero.
i
mean,
that
would
seem...
where
this
equity
idea
is
the
camel
and
the
production
idea
is
the
gnat,
and
is
there
any...
can
we
say
something
like
that,
or
does
congress
have
total
leeway
in
respect
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--who
they
want
to
give
the
money
to,
basically?
