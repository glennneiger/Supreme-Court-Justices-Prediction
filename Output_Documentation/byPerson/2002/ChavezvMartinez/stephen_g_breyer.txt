justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
in
your
opinion
in
the
constitution
prevents
a
policeman
from
going
and
beating
up
a
witness?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
the
fourteenth
amendment
means
that
you
could...
in
other
words,
your...
your
client
could
have
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
if...
other
things
being
equal--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
he
was
a
witness.
he
gets
at
least...
at
least
the
suspect--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--gets
the
same
pre-trial
protection
as
a
witness
would,
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
prevents
coercion
being
used
against
a
witness
who
doesn't
want
to
testify.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
not
saying...
those
things
that
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment
weren't
introduced
into
trial
do
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
the
similar
reasons.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
could
you
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
those
things...
you
could
say
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
why
didn't
he
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you...
i
think
you
could
say
after...
after
30
years
or
50
years
of...
of
jurisprudence,
policemen
know
they're
not
supposed
to
beat
up
suspects
or
the...
the
equivalent.
and...
and
you
can
say,
all
right,
at
this
point,
i
would
think
that
does
shock
the
conscience
for
a
policeman
to
beat
a
confession
out
of
somebody,
and
so
i
don't
care
if
you
call
it
fourteenth
or
fifth.
but
then
the
question
here
would
be,
why
in
heaven's
name,
when
the
person
is
undergoing
serious
pain,
or
he
thinks
he's
dying,
where
the
doctors
are
saying,
get
out
of
here,
et
cetera,
whatever
they're
saying,
and
he
continues
to
press
and
then
says,
well,
you're
going
to
get
your
treatment
after
you
confess...
not
confess...
after...
after
you
answer
my
question.
what
were
you
doing?
then
we'll
treat
you.
he
says,
you
want
your
treatment,
you'd
better...
you
better
say
something,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
why
isn't
that
the
equivalent
of
beating
somebody
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
maybe
the...
the
point
where
it
would
make
a
difference
i
guess...
nobody
is
talking
about
weakening
or
overruling
miranda.
we
have
miranda
on
the
books,
and
miranda
set
some
technical
requirements.
you
have
to
give
a
warning.
now,
a
failure
to
give
a
warning,
pure
and
simple,
is
not
going
to
hurt
anybody
if
that's
never
used
in
trial,
so
there
isn't
1983
damages,
unless
you
beat
the
person
up.
then
there
is.
and
that
comes
under
the
fourteenth.
but
there
are
a
set
of
cases
where
it
will
hurt
people.
the
set
of
cases
where
it
will
hurt
people
is
where
because
they
violated
miranda
but
didn't
beat
him
up,
and
got
a
statement,
they
kept
him
in
jail.
that's
rather
like
the
case
justice
kennedy's
thinking
of.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
say
it
comes
under
the
fifth
amendment,
the
answer
is
going
to
be
yes.
and
if
you
say
it
comes
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
answer
is
going
to
be
no.
i
don't
know
if
we
should...
it
seems
to
me
what
we're
going
to
decide
in
this
case
is
effectively
going
to
decide
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
he
goes
under
the
fourth,
and
he
claims
he's
wrongly
seized
and
imprisoned
because
they
got
this
statement
out
of
him
in
violation
of
the
fifth.
that's...
i
mean,
this
is...
this
is
what's...
what's
worrying
me
is
not
so
much
this
case,
but
what
we're
going
to
write
and
the
implications
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
maybe
the
answer
would
be
that...
that
it's
not...
the
fifth
amendment...
the...
the
miranda
rules
are
methods
of
enforcing
the
fifth
amendment
so
that
if
all
is
violated
in...
in
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
is
a
miranda
rule
and
the
person
is
not
proceeded
against
in
court
and
the
person
has
not
been
physically
injured
in
any
way
and
has
not
suffered
any
real
harm
except
not
being
read
a
right
that
didn't
matter
anyway,
he
would
have
no
damages.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
could
bring
his
lawsuit,
but
he'd
gain
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
your
case.
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
why
the
fourteenth.
i
mean,
the
fourteenth...
the
fifth
applies
to
the
states
because
it's
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
therefore,
if
in
fact
you
violate
the
fifth
in...
in
a
way
that's
significant,
not
just...
i
mean,
causes
significant
harm,
not
just
you
didn't
read
a
miranda
right,
but
you
hurt
somebody,
then
why
wouldn't
the
fourteenth
carry
that
through
to
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that...
for
purposes
of
a
damage
action,
not
for
purposes
of
miranda,
or
what's
admissible.
but
for
purposes
of
a
miranda
action,
should
a
suspect
be
in
a
better
position
than
a
totally
innocent
witness
insofar
as
the
police
beating
him
up
is
concerned?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
had
beaten
him
up
or
been
coercive,
it
should
be
the
same
problem
whether
he's
the
witness
or
the
suspect.
and
if
they've
gone
past
whatever
point
is
reasonable,
i
guess
there
should
be
damages.
and
if
they're
doing
it
for
a
good
reason
because
they
want
to
stop
an
attack
or
something,
well,
that's
just
the
way
it
is.
and...
and
that's...
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
if
that's
what
the
law
is
and
what
the
right
words
are
to
get
to
that
place
and
how
you
deal
with
this
mass
of...
of
constitutional
rules,
if...
if
that's
the
proper
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you...
did
you
come
up
anywhere
in
your...
in
your
research
on
this
with
anything
that
suggests
that...
that
once
the
person
is
a
suspect,
and
once
he's
in
custody
of
the
police,
that
the
criminal
case
has
begun?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
is
it
clear
that
that
isn't?
is
it
clear
that
the
criminal
case
that
the
constitution
refers
to
is...
is
not
really
begun
until
it's
what
we'd
call
technically
is
a
criminal
case,
the
filing,
you
know,
indictment,
or...
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
that...
what?
that
the
criminal
case
had
begun
at
the
time
he
was
in
custody?
