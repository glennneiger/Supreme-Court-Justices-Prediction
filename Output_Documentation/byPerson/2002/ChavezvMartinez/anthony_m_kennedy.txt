justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
in
a
civil
case,
the
judge
orders
the
witness
confined
to
custody
until
he
testifies
in
violation
of
what
we
can
say
in
common
parlance
is
his
fifth
amendment
right
to
self-incrimination.
is
that
not
a
violation
then
and
there
to...
to
confine
the...
the
defendant
until
he
testifies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
don't
know
that
we
usually
talk
about
a
violation
as
an
unconstitutional
condition.
we...
we
would
say,
your
honor,
i
want
my
client
released
because
you
are
violating
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
think
in
a
very
realistic...
real
sense
you
are.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i...
i
just
have
to
tell
you,
i...
i
can
see
your...
your
point
on
miranda.
miranda
is
an
exclusionary
rule.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
all
of
the
fifth
amendment
is...
is
treated
in
that
way
because
of
the
questions
we've
initially
covered.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
if
you
beat
the
defendant
to
get
the
defendant...
to
get
the
confession,
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
very
strong
argument
that
that
is
a
fifth
amendment
violation--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--a
self-incrimination
clause
violation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
beating
a
prisoner
to
compel
a...
a
statement
is
not
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
order
of
a
trial
judge
in
a
civil
case
who
orders
the
witness
held
in
contempt
and
confined
unless
he
testifies,
and...
and
there's
a
valid
fifth
amendment
privilege
that
the
judge
is
overlooking?
no
fifth
amendment
violation
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
if
you
go
in
and
you
want
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
you
don't
mention
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
there's
a
1983
suit
against
a
judge
in...
in
this
hypothetical
case,
what's...
what's
the
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it's
a
1983
suit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
violation
in
the
case
that
i
put,
any
constitutional
violation?
i
mean,
that's...
that's
extraordinary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
may
i
just
interrupt,
mr.
clement?
supposing
there's
a
witness,
a
reporter
or
somebody,
who
claims
a...
a
privilege
against
divulging
information,
and
that...
and
the
court
holds
him
in
contempt
and
locks
him
up
for
30
days
or
something,
and
he
claims
he...
his
fifth
amendment
right
was
violated,
you'd
say
there's
no
fifth
amendment
violation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
how
could
he
get
out
of
jail
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
think--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--with
all
respect,
i
think
you're
evading
the
point
that
there...
let's
assume
there's
damage.
he's...
he's
locked
up,
as
justice
breyer
says,
for
5
days
for
not
testifying,
and
you
say
there's
no
fifth
amendment
violation.
i
can't
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
are
you
saying
that...
to
go
back
to
a
question
that
was
asked
earlier,
that
if
there...
if
the
police
just
take
somebody
into
custody
and
beat
him
up
in
order
to
get...
get
him
to
talk
with
no
intention
of
using
the
evidence
at
all...
they're
just
trying
to
investigate
a
crime...
is
there
any
constitutional
protection
against
that
kind
of
conduct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
all
right.
you
can
make
that
sentence,
if
you
want
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
let...
let's
assume
that
we
decide
the
case,
and
then
this
happens
a
second
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question.
you
can't
get
away
on
qualified
immunity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
asked
about
coercion.
there
was
no
coercion
in
quarles.
there
was
just
an
absence
of
miranda
warning.
forget
miranda.
let's
just
talk
about
coercion.
is
there
a
fifth
amendment
violation
in
the
case
that
he
put
where
there
was...
there's
an
element...
there's
a...
there's
a
degree
of
coercion?
there's
no
miranda
warning.
that's
out
of
the
case.
there's
no
sovereign...
qualified
immunity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this...
this
question
is
somewhat
like
justice
scalia's
question.
suppose
the
same
facts
so
far
as
the
hospital
was
concerned,
but
that
the...
that
the
incident
involved
a
kidnapping
and
the
injured
person,
your
client,
was
a
witness
to
the
kidnapping.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if...
if
the
questioning...
and
suppose
he
says,
go
away,
i'm
sick,
i'm
sick.
and
they
said,
no,
no,
we
want
your
answer.
why
is
there
coercion
in...
no
coercion
in
that
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
coercion
in
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's...
that's
a
miranda
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
it's
a...
well,
it's
also
a
basic
fifth
amendment
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
isn't...
why
isn't
the
element
of
coercion
the
same
in
each
case?
