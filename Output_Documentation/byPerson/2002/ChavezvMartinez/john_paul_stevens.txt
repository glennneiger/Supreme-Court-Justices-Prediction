john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
number
01-1444,
chavez
against
martinez.
mr.
robbins,
whenever
you're
prepared,
you
may
proceed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
on
that
point
that
you
addressed
before
you
get
through?
supposing
he
thought
at
the
time
of
the
questioning
that
the
material...
the
answers
would
be
used
in
evidence
later
on,
and
he
knew
that
it
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
constitution
to
use
those
answers
later
on.
would
he
be
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your...
i'm
just
directing
my
question
at...
you
sort
of
said
even
assuming
a
constitutional
violation,
he
nevertheless
is
entitled
to
good
faith
immunity.
and
i'm
saying,
well,
assume
the...
the
facts
i've
just
granted,
including
an
assumption
that
the...
it
would
have
been
a
constitutional
violation
to
use
the
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
paz,
i'm
sorry.
i
don't...
your
page
28
in
the
cert
petition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
where?
i
didn't...
i
don't
find
it
on
that
page.
justice
john
paul
stevens
"finally
defendants
argue
#"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
i'm
with
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
robbins,
why
couldn't...
why
couldn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
couldn't
you
view
the
continued
questioning
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
as
tantamount
to
punishment
when
you
have
locked
somebody
up
who
won't
answer
questions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
robbins.
the
case
is
submitted.
