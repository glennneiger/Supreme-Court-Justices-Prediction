fisrt
case
i
have
to
announce
is
chavez
versus
martinez,
no.
01-1444.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
while
respondent
martinez
was
being
treated
for
gunshot
wounds
received
during
an
altercation
with
police,
he
was
interrogated
by
petitioner
chavez,
a
patrol
supervisor.
at
no
point
was
martinez
given
miranda
warnings.
although
he
was
never
charged
with
a
crime
and
his
answers
were
never
used
against
him
in
any
criminal
proceeding,
martinez
filed
a
1983
suit
claiming
that
chavez
violated
his
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
and
as
fourteenth
amendment
substantive
due
process
right.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
ruling
that
chavez
was
not
entitle
to
qualified
immunity.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceeding.
chavez
is
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
as
to
martinez's
fifth
amendment
claim.
while
the
majority
of
the
court
remands
as
to
martinez's
fourteenth
amendment
claim,
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
i
would
conclude
that
martinez's
fourteenth
amendment
rights
were
not
violated.
the
opinion
is
joined
by
the
chief
jjustice
in
