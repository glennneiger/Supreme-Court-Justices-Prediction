mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
safeguards
the
integrity
of
the
criminal
trial
process
and
ensures
that
an
individual
is
not
convicted
on
the
basis
of
a
coerced
confession.
but
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
not
a
direct
limit
on
the
primary
conduct
of
the
law
enforcement
officers.
this
is
not
to
say
that
there
are
no
substantive
constitutional
limits
on
what
law
officers
may
do
to
obtain
information
or
to
secure
a
confession.
but
those
limits
are
to
be
found
in
the
fourth
amendment
and
in
the
law
of
substantive
due
process,
not
in
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
privilege--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
right,
justice
kennedy.
it's
not
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
it
very
well
might
be--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
very
well...
justice
o'connor,
it
very
well
could
be
a
fourteenth--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
generally,
at
least
as
i
understand
this
court's
decision
in...
in
sacramento
against
lewis,
in
these
kind
of
executive
action
contexts
where
things
are
ongoing,
i
think
there
is
some
kind
of
intent
element.
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i'm
not
sure
how
intent
would
need
to
be
proven
in
any
particular
case,
but
i
would
say
the
critical
difference
between
the
fifth
amendment
inquiry
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
inquiry,
when
it's...
when
it's
done
in
the
context
of
the
admissibility
of
a
coerced
confession,
is
in
that
context,
what
the
courts
are
taking
into
account
is
the
effect
on
the
integrity
of
the
trial
process
of
using
a
coerced
confession.
it's
a
different
calculus,
though,
when
you're
trying
to
regulate
primary
law
enforcement
conduct
because
it
strikes
me
that
not
everything
that
a
law
enforcement
officer
could
do
to
coerce
a
confession...
there...
there
may
be
some
acts
that
may
be
sufficiently
problematic
that
you'd
certainly
want
to
keep
the
confession
out
of
the
trial.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
i
don't
think
there's
a
fifth
amendment...
i
don't
think
there's
a
complete
fifth
amendment
violation.
the
courts
intervene
there
to
protect
the
privilege.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
you
mention
the
fifth
amendment,
but
i
think
the
important
thing
is
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
context
works
a...
a
bit
like
the
takings
clause.
and
justice
souter,
for
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
balsys,
noted
that
the
self-incrimination
privilege
is
unusual
because
it's
not
purely
and
simply
binding
on
the
government.
it
doesn't
say
that
in
all
contexts,
the
government
cannot
coerce
confessions.
what
it
says--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
typically
those
cases
have
been
dealt
with
on...
on
habeas.
and
what
i
would
say
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--if
there's
a
1983
suit
in
that
context,
i
actually
don't
think
a
1983
suit
would
lie
in
that
context.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
a
very
good
point,
justice
souter,
and
the
court
has
also
treated
in
the
penalty
context--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
so,
but
i
think
it
would--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--at
least
be
a
better
case.
but
as
i
was
trying
to
say--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--there
is
a...
there
is
a...
there...
what
there
is
is
there
is
an
ongoing
interference
with
the
fifth
amendment
right
that
the
courts
will
vindicate,
but
there
isn't
a
complete
constitutional
violation.
and
i
think
the
critical
distinction
is
that,
as...
as
justice
souter
said
for
the
court
in
balsys,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
not
purely
and
simply
binding
on
the
government.
the
government
can
compel
testimony
in
exchange
for
a
valid
grant
of
immunity.
what
it
can't
do
is
compel
testimony
and
attempt
to
use
it
in
a
criminal
case.
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no.
i
don't
think
that's
true.
i
think
that,
for
one
thing,
if
the
person
is
imprisoned
on
some
basis,
that
may
raise
an
independent
fourth
amendment
violation.
there
may
be
other--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and...
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
already
clarified
in
balsys
that
what
you
need
for
a
self-incrimination
violation
is
both
the
coercion
of
the
testimony
and
the
use
of
it
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
say
there's
no...
there's
no
damages
action.
of
course,
he
could
get--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
he
could
get
a
habeas
action
to
get
out
because
the
court
would
be
granting
relief--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--to
protect
the
fifth
amendment--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
in
any
event,
let
me
just
say
that
the
privilege
works
quite
differently
in
the
custodial
context.
the
reason
that
hypo
even
comes
up
is
that
in
the
context
of
a
civil
trial,
the
individual
has
to
raise
the...
the
self-incrimination
clause
themselves.
and
we
have
a
different
rule
that
operates
in
the
context
of
police
custodial
interrogation.
in
that
context,
the
privilege
is
self-executing.
the
individual
doesn't
have
to
raise
it.
and...
as...
the
other
thing
that's
different
about
the
custodial
context
is
that
in
the
custodial
context,
this
court
has
not
insisted
on
a
pre-testimony
grant
of
immunity.
they've
always
held
that
the
exclusionary
rules
prevent
a
constitutional
violation
from
occurring.
and
if
i
could
resort
to
the
analogy
to
the
takings
clause.
in
that
context,
it's
not
enough
for
the
government
to
take
property.
it's
only
a
constitutional
violation
if
the...
if
the
government
simultaneously
takes
property
and
refuses
to
grant
just
compensation.
in
the
same
way,
there's
no
self--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
and
it's
the
substantive
due
process
protection.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
i
think
to
get
back
to
that
point,
what's
important
is
in
the
context
of
trying
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
criminal
trial
process,
i
would
think
the
courts
would
want
to
be
quite
careful
about
what
they
let
into
evidence.
but
in
the
context
of
law
enforcement
officers,
they're
dealing
with
other
objectives
than
simply
trying
to
get
a
confession
to
secure
a
guilty
verdict.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
it
should,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
that's
best
done
on
remand--
yes.
--because,
although
there
is
a
due
process
argument
in
this
case,
it's
nobody's
fault
that
in
light
of
the...
the
governing
precedent
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
cooper
decision,
that
nobody
thought
that
they
had
to
prove
shocks-the-conscience,
or
any
of
the
factors
relevant
to
a
substantive
due
process
inquiry.
again,
that's
not
the
way
respondents
briefed
the
case,
but
one
can
hardly
blame
them
for
briefing
the
case
they
did,
given
that
the
ninth
circuit
had
held
under
cooper
that
as
long
as
the
conduct
was
sufficiently
egregious
to
have
the
evidence
be
inadmissible,
therefore
you
have
a
full
substantive
due
process
violation.
and
i
think
it's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i...
i
don't
really
disagree
with
him.
i
think
this
court
could
reach
the
qualified
immunity
issue
if
it
wanted
to,
but
i
think
perhaps
the
path
of
least
resistance
would
be
to
just
note
that
there
is
a
substantive
due
process
limit,
and
that's
something
that's
best
to
be
resolved
on...
on
remand.
i
think
the
important...
oh,
sorry.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you
very
much.
