justice
david
h.
souter
why
wouldn't
there
be
a
1983
suit
provided
that...
and
i
think
this
is
the
assumption
of
justice
kennedy's
question...
provided
that
the
witness
had
invoked
the
fifth
amendment?
there
would
be
a
1983
action
there
because
that
is
one
at
least
of
two
instances
in
which
we
allow
the
fifth
amendment
to
have
an
application
in
anticipation.
we
say
if
he
raises
it,
and
they
don't
come
forward
with
immunity,
we're
not
going
to
let
this
entire
process
go
forward
to
no
avail
since
nothing
can
ever
be
admitted
in
evidence
anyway.
the
fact
is
we...
the...
the
rule
allowing
it
to
be
raised
in
anticipation
i
suppose
would
be
the
predicate
for
1983
liability
here.
that's
not
this
case,
but
that...
that
would
be
true
in
the...
in
the
case
of
the...
the
civil
example
that
justice
kennedy
gave,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
good
enough
so
that
you
concede
there
would
be
1983
liability
there;
i.e.,
that
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
that
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
not
that
good.
