justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
robbins,
going
back
to
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
privilege,
i
take
it
the
thrust
of
your
argument
is
that
a
police
officer
who
fails
to
give
miranda
warnings
quite
deliberately,
doesn't
say
you
have
a
right
to
remain
silent,
doesn't
say
any
of
the
rest
of
it,
never
commits
a
violation
of
1983
unless
and
until
there's
attempt
to
use
the
information
in
court.
so
you
can
say,
police
officer,
you're
not
required
to
give
miranda
warnings
if
we're
not
going
to
use
this
testimony
in
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
the
miranda
is...
is
not
an
obligation
of
the
police
officer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there...
you're
saying
there
is
no
1983
penalty.
the
penalty
is
you
can't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
was
this
tried
below
with
a
fourteenth
amendment
substantive
due
process
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
in
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
is
it
open
to
resolution
on
that
basis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if...
if
we
think
the
facts
here
show
sufficient
coercion
to
rise
to
the
level
of
a
violation
of
substantive
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
should
the
judgment
be
affirmed--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
on
a
different
basis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
exigency.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that?
you
said
the
man
was
dying.
this
was
the
only...
only
chance.
but
there
was
an
eyewitness,
flores,
to
this
entire
thing.
why
wasn't
it
enough
for
the
police,
if
they
wanted
some
view
other
than
the
police
officers
who
engaged
in
the...
in
the
shooting,
just
to
interview
flores?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
he
be
a
lot
clearer
than
a
man
who...
who
is...
who
has
been
blinded,
who
has...
was
paralyzed,
who's
under
heavy
medication?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
could
be
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
very
likely
would
be.
is
there
some
intent
element
in
that
for
the
shocks-the-conscience--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it's
not
enough,
you
think,
to
find
that
the
officer
should
have
known
that
you
couldn't
ask
questions
in
the
manner
that
was
done
here
under
these
circumstances,
and
that
to
proceed
gives
rise
to
an
inference
of
intent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
should
it
be
analyzed
then
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
coercion--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--an
activity
that
might
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
disagree
with
mr.
robbins
who
said,
but
because
of
the
qualified
immunity,
you
wouldn't
send
this
back
in
any
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
this
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
case,
not
a
fifth
amendment
case
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
it
tried
on
that
basis--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--presented
on
that
basis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--by
way
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it
clear
by
now
in
our
cases
that
if
a
policeman
uses
excessive
force
that
rises
to
the
level
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
that
we
will
address
it
under
that
amendment,
that
the
fifth
amendment,
the
language
of
it
refers
to
use
in
trial
of
the
testimony?
and...
and
you
don't
have
that
limitation--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--under
a
substantive
due
process
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
going
back
to
your
earlier
distinction
between
the
suspect
and
a
witness,
if
someone
is
suspected
of
kidnapping
a
child,
and
that
child
is
not
going
to
live
without
some
medication...
i
believe
this
example
was
brought
up
in
one
of
the
briefs...
and
the
suspect,
whatever
answer,
will
certainly
be
incriminating,
the
police
may
not
exercise
any
coercion
to
get
the
suspected
kidnapper
to
tell
where
the
child
is
so
the
child
could
get
life-saving
medication?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
on
the
other
side
is...
is
the
life
of
a
child.
