mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
this
case
that
petitioner
ben
chavez
could
not
assert
a
qualified
immunity
defense
to
a
section
1983
lawsuit
alleging
that
his
interrogation
of
respondent
violated
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
we
believe
that
ruling
to
be
mistaken.
first,
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
at
all
on
these
facts.
but
second,
if
there
was
a
constitutional
right
implicated,
that
right
was
not
clearly
established
in
the
particularized
sense
required
by
this
court's
qualified
immunity
cases.
officer
chavez
could
not
reasonably
have
known
that
what
he
was
doing
violated
that
right,
and
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
should,
therefore,
be
reversed.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
yes,
because
the
constitution...
well,
because
the
first
inquiry
would
be
has
the
constitution
been
violated.
whether
he
thought--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
think...
i
think
the...
the
answer
is
that
while...
while
he
might
have
believed
that
the
constitution
would
in
time
be
violated,
because
he
could
not
himself
violate
it,
he
couldn't...
he
couldn't
be
liable
under
section
1983
for
committing
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
so
the
point
is
you
don't
even
get
to
the
question
of
clearly
established
if
there's
no
established
constitutional
violation
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i...
i
think
you've
put
it
exactly
right.
it
has
some
antecedent
application.
that
is
to
say,
it
applies
prior
to
the
moment
at
which
it's
actually
violated.
the
premise
is
we
need
to
ensure
against...
in
a
way
it's
a
prophylactic
protection
much
like
miranda
is.
that
is
to
say,
we
will
let
you
assert
it
in
what
is
concededly,
for
example,
a
civil
litigation
setting,
a
simple
deposition.
no
one
would
suggest
that
that
is
a
use
in
a
criminal
case.
but
we
allow
you
to
assert
it
because
if
we
didn't,
it
would
compromise
your
ability
to
ensure
that
the
right
is
protected
later.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think
it
is
consistent
with
a
body
of
well...
well-developed
law
that
to
penalize
someone,
particularly
through
that
kind
of
a
sanction,
for
the
assertion
of
a
right
is
in
the
nature
of
a...
sort
of
an
unconstitutional
condition.
and
there's
a
well-established
body
of
law
that
says--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--but
i...
i--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes.
i...
i
think
there
is
a
body
of
case
law
that
says
that
if
you
are
punished
for
the
assertion
of
a
right,
then
under
the
constitution
you
can
be
relieved
of
that
coercion.
however...
but
let
me
be
clear...
the
actual
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
exactly
what
the
text
of
the
fifth
amendment
says.
it
says
that
your
right
is
not
to
be
a
witness
against
yourself
in
a
criminal
case.
i
suggest,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
result...
that
the
holding
in
murphy
against
the
waterfront
commission
is
inexplicable
if
you
believe,
as
the
ninth
circuit
does,
that
it
is
sufficient
simply
to
coerce
an
otherwise
incriminating
statement
because
in
murphy
against
the
waterfront
commission,
the
holding
of
that
case
is
that
the
state
court
was
correct
in
requiring
the
witness
to
testify
even
though
there
wasn't
a
statute
that
protected
him
against
incrimination
because
the
fifth
amendment
itself
provides
the
fail-safe
that
if
you
are
coerced
into
giving
an
otherwise
incriminating
statement,
it
cannot
be
used
against
you.
and
my
central
submission
on
the
fifth
amendment
point...
and
of
course,
this
is
before
we
even
get
to
the
question
whether
office
chavez
could
have...
you
know,
has
qualified
immunity.
our
central
submission
on
this
is
that
you
don't
even
have
to
get
to
that
point
because
the
fail-safe
of
the
fifth
amendment
ensures
that
mr.
martinez's
statements
could
not
be
used
against
him
in
a
criminal
case
if
they
were
indeed
legally
compelled--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
let's
be
clear.
it
doesn't
prevent
all
coercion.
it
prevents
a
subset
of
coercion
that
shocks
the
conscience
for
purposes
of
the...
the
substantive
component
of
due
process.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
correct.
but...
but
i
think
it
is
important
that
we
not
torture
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
accommodate
the
worry
that
police
officers
will
torture
witnesses
because
that
concern
is
completely...
can
be
completely
accommodated,
and
routinely
is
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
under
the
aegis
of
the--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
yes.
you...
you
could
say--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
he...
well,
again,
let
me...
i...
i
want
to
answer
that,
but
i...
i...
because
this
is
a
qualified
immunity
case,
i
always
want
to
drop
the
footnote
that
we
have
an
extra
layer
of
protection
here
arising
from
the
fact
that
none
of
these
propositions
could
have
been...
none
of
the
propositions
adverse
to
us
could
plausibly
be
said
to
be
clearly
established
within
the
right
sense
of
the
term.
getting
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
he
did
not
violate
the
substantive
component
of
the
due
process
clause
because
that
inquiry
turns
on
a
set
of
concerns,
including
did
the
acts
shock
the
conscience.
were
they
committed
with
the
intent
to
harm
the
witness
in
the
sense
required
by
sacramento
against
lewis?
the
failure
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
substantive
due
process
analysis
was
that
it
thought
that
any
interrogation
which
would
render
a
statement
involuntary
and
therefore
inadmissible
at
trial
must,
therefore,
give
rise
to
a
freestanding
substantive
due
process
claim,
actionable
and
enforceable
under
section
1983.
that's
just
wrong.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
am
saying...
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
the...
the--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i...
i
respectfully
beg
to
differ,
and
i...
i
also
think...
i
must
say,
given
the
prominence
of
the
miranda
discussion
in
the
respondent's
brief
and
in
the
green...
green
brief
supporting
respondent,
i
believe
the
miranda
concerns
in
this
case
are
an
utter
red
herring,
and
let
me
say
why.
the
sanction
for
the
violation
of
miranda
is,
in
fact,
that
the
statements
taken
in
violation
of
miranda
cannot
be
used
in
the
direct
case
of
the
government.
that's
the
penalty
for
miranda,
and
if
that
happens,
you
get
the
statement
struck
in
the
direct
case
for
the
government.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i...
i
think
there
is
no
1983
penalty,
but
the
suggestion
that
as
a
consequence,
because
you
don't
have
a
freestanding
section
1983
claim
when
the
evidence
never
comes
in,
when
the
statement
is
never
offered,
the
suggestion
that
that
is
therefore
going
to
be...
send
a
signal
to
police
officers
that
they
should
violate
miranda,
you
know,
at
their...
at
their
discretion
i
think
is
terribly
mistaken,
and
for
a
very
important
reason
and
it's
this:
if
you
don't
give
miranda
warnings,
you
run
a
serious
risk
that
the
failure
to
give
those
warnings
will
be
taken
as
part
of
the
calculus
under
the
fifth
amendment
voluntariness
inquiry.
and
a
statement
which
is
involuntary
for
fifth
amendment
purposes
is
unusable
for
any
purpose
at
all,
direct
case,
impeachment,
derivative
use.
the
government
then
has
to
put
on
a
kastigar
hearing
to
show
that
all
of
its
evidence
was
independently
derived,
which
is,
as
the
court
said
in
kastigar,
a
heavy
burden
for
the
government
to
meet.
it
is
a
fool's
errand
i
suggest,
justice
ginsburg...
a
fool's
errand...
to
go
about
deliberately
violating
miranda
simply
because
the
violation
will
not
cause...
give
rise
to
a
section
1983
violation.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think...
respectfully,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
there
is
a
wealth
of
this
court...
this
court's
cases
that
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
proposition
that
coercing
a
statement
is
enough
by
itself
to
constitute
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
let
me
attempt,
if...
if
i
might,
justice
breyer,
to...
to
very
quickly
answer
justice
kennedy's
question.
i...
i
think
the
belief
that
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
it's
enough
under
the
fifth
amendment
simply
to
coerce
a
statement
that
would
otherwise
be
incriminating
cannot
be
reconciled
with
murphy
and
with
the...
with
balsys,
with
the
immunity
cases,
with
all
the
cases
that
stand
for
the
proposition
that
so
long
as
the
use
immunity
has
not
been
compromised,
you
do
not
yet
have
a
substantive
fifth
amendment
violation.
to
turn,
justice
breyer,
to
your
question,
i
acknowledge
that
there
is
coercion
in
this
case.
we
don't...
we
don't
blanch
on
that.
there
was
coercion
and
the
facts
of
this
case
are
tragic,
but
the...
but
the
reality
is
this.
this
officer
was
there
to
find
out
a
very
important
piece
of
information
under
extraordinarily
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
don't
know
that
it
was
denominated
substantive
due
process.
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--there's...
there's
no
question
that
the
ninth
circuit
decided
a
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
question.
i
don't
think
they...
they
labeled
it
substantive
versus
procedure.
and
indeed,
as
we
suggest--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--they
conflated
the
two.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
the
judgment
must
be
reversed,
first,
because
there
is
not
even
a
suggestion
that
the
intent
to
harm
requirement
under
sacramento
against
lewis
has
been
satisfied.
and
under
this...
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
you
cannot
have
a
substantive
due...
due
process
violation
without
that.
no
one
before
you
today
has
argued
that
that
sacramento
against
lewis--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--is
that...
the
source
i...
i
suggest
is
the...
the
principles
this
court
articulated
in
sacramento
against
lewis
for
police
conduct
that's
taken
in
enormous
haste
where...
where
there
is
not
the
opportunity
for
a
second
chance.
but
let
me
go...
there's
a
terribly
important
thing,
justice
o'connor,
i
have
not
yet
gotten
to
say
in
answer
to
your
question.
the
further
and
perhaps
most
fundamental
reason
why
it
would
be
a
mistake,
i
respectfully
suggest,
to
affirm
this
judgment,
even
on
the
due
process
argument,
is
that
this
is
a
qualified
immunity
case.
so
you
must
conclude
not
only
that
on
balance
this
rises
to
the
shock-the-conscience
standard,
but
that
it
does
so
with
such
remarkable
clarity
that
it
must
have
been
surely
apparent
to
this
officer
that
he
was
violating
that
standard.
you
cannot
find
that
on
this
record.
the
ninth
circuit
thought
so
because
of
mincey,
which
is
a
fair
trial
and
admissibility
of
evidence
case,
not
a
freestanding
substantive
due
process
case
and
which
had
all
manner
of
important
differences
from
the
facts
of
this
case,
including
an
absence...
a
total
absence...
of
exigency.
with
the
court's
permission--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i...
i
think
the
record
suggests
that
he
was
not
a
completely
clear...
did
not
have
a
completely
clear
view
of
the
facts.
but
he's
just
one
witness.
this
is
the
man
who
was
there.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
he...
he
was
the
most
important
non-police
witness
to
these
events,
and
i
suggest
that
the
officer
would
have
been
derelict
not
to
have
found
out
what
happened
from
him,
which
is
what
he
was
trying
to
do.
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr....
justice
stevens.
let
me
just
quickly
make
a
couple
of
points.
it
seems
to
me
that
petitioner
can
win
this
case
the
hard
way
or
the
easy
way.
the
easy
way
is
recognizing
that
this
body
of
law
is,
as
one
of
the
members
said
this
morning,
a
complex
of
constitutional
issues
with
cross
currents
that
cut
in
a
variety
of
directions,
that
in
light
of
verdugo
urquidez,
in
light
of
sacramento
against
lewis,
it
cannot
be
said
that
any
of
these
constitutional
principles
was
sufficiently
clearly
established
to
warrant
the
rejection
of
qualified
immunity.
but
i
want
to
win
it
the
hard
way.
first,
because
under
sacramento
against
lewis,
the
standard
for
substantive
due
process
is
intent
to
harm.
that
wasn't
pled.
that
wasn't
tried.
there's
no
such
argument
before
you
today.
no
one
thinks
that
if
sacramento
against
lewis
applies,
there
can
be
a
substantive
due
process
claim
at
all.
that's
why
it
wasn't
in
the
complaint.
and
no
one
here
before
you
is
suggesting
intent
to
harm.
now,
on
the
fifth
amendment,
justice
kennedy,
i'd
like
to
take
one
more
crack
at
the
concern
that
you've
articulated
because
i
think
it
is...
it
is
in
fact
possible
to
square
those
concerns
with
the
holding
in
murphy
against
waterfront
commission
which,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
is
perfectly
good
law
and
consistent
with
what
this
court
said
in
footnote
8
of
balsys
about
the
fail-safe
of
use
immunity
provided
directly
by
the
fifth
amendment.
so
long
as
the
government
has
not
compromised
the
availability
of
use
immunity
under
the
fifth
amendment,
there
hasn't
been
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
in
each
of
the
penalty
cases
that
are
suggested
by
your
hypothetical,
that's
what
the
government
has
done.
they
have
said
to
the
witness,
you
may
not
have
immunity.
you
may
not
assert
your
fifth
amendment.
if
you
assert
your
fifth
amendment
right,
we're
going
to
put
you
in
lock-up
right
now.
the
court
has
consistently
said,
you
know,
if
you
forfeit
the
use
immunity
and
actually
put
a
guy
in
jail
because
he
insists
on
it,
that's
as
good
as
use.
that's
a
protection
that
stems
from
the
fifth
amendment
itself.
and
that's...
that
explains
all
of
the
so-called
penalty
cases.
the
police...
the
garrity
case
in
new
jersey,
the
two
lefkowitz
cases
out
of
new
york.
that
explains...
what
is,
in
fact,
going
on
there
is
someone
is
being
punished
or
penalized
for
the
assertion
of
a
privilege,
including
the
right
against
use.
but
as
long
as
the
fail-safe
in
the
words...
justice
souter,
that
you
used
in...
in
footnote
8
of
balsys,
as
long
as
the
fail-safe
of
use
immunity
has
not
been
compromised,
as
it
has
not
been
in
this
case,
there
is
not
yet
a
full
fifth
amendment
violation,
which
can
only
happen
when
there's
a
use
in
a
criminal
case.
and
that
is
exactly
the
point
that
this
court
in
verdugo
urquidez
said
in
the
passage
that
the
ninth
circuit
decided
to
call
dictum
and
ignore.
that
was
a
big
mistake.
and
on
that
ground
alone,
it's
the
fifth
amendment
portion
of
its
decision--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--that
should
be
reversed
at
the
first
threshold.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i...
i
think
because...
well,
for
one
thing,
the
availability
of
use
immunity
is
still
there.
what
you...
what
i
think
it
would...
what
i
think...
what
i
think
it
would
amount
to
is
continued
coercion
of
a
statement
which
arguably
at
some
threshold,
once
you
cross
it,
does
indeed
become
too
coercive
to
render
the
statement
admissible.
but
that's
when
the
fifth
amendment
fail-safe
steps
in
and
says,
you
may
not
use
it.
that
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
but
because
the
fail-safe
wasn't
compromised
in
this
case,
as
it
was
in
the
line
of
cases
suggested
by
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
there
cannot
be
a
fifth
amendment,
and
we
don't
even
have
to
reach
the
question
of
qualified
immunity.
