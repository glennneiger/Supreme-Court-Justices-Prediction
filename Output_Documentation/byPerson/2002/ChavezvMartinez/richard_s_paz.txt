mr.
richard
s.
paz
justice
stevens,
and
if
it
pleases
the
court:
i...
i
would
start
with
simply
the
simple
observation
that
the
district
court
made
a
finding
of
fact
in
this
case
at
page...
it's
28a
and
29
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the...
in
the
appendix.
and
it
goes
directly
to
the
issue
of
what
we've
been
discussing
and
that
is
the...
the
intent.
and
just
if
i
can
back
up
a
little
bit
procedurally,
in
argument
today,
for
the
first
time
i
heard
counsel
say
that
they
acknowledge
there's
no
quarrel
that
there
was
coercion
in
this
case.
in
the
district
court,
the
entire
argument
was
there
was
no
coercion.
at
the
court
of
appeals,
the
entire
argument
was
there
was
no
coercion.
at
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
the...
there
was
never
a
discussion
or...
or
even
was
the
case
of
urquidez...
verdugo
urquidez
cited
for
the
fact
of...
that
this
was...
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments
were
only
a
trial
right.
those
issues
are
being
heard
here
for
the
first
time.
they
were
briefed
for
the
first
time
in
the
opening
brief.
cert
was
granted
in
this
case
on
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
not...
the
fourteenth
amendment
wasn't
even
discussed
on
cert.--
so
we've
gone
through
this
journey
of
ever-changing
theories
of...
of
liability
in
this
case,
but
i
think
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
beginning.
the
district
court
found
at
page
28,
finally
defendants
argued
that
chavez
was
not
attempting
to
abridge
the
right
against
self-incrimination
to...
to
exact...
extract
self-inculpatory
data
or
leads.
and
the
court
goes
on
to
then
describe
what
was
argued
by
the
defense,
that
mr.
chavez
was
there
simply
to
find
out
what
happened.
the
court
directly
rejected
that.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
it's
28a
in
the
appendix
of
the...
of
the
petition
for
cert,
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
it
starts
at
the...
at
approximately
the...
the
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
yes.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
yes.
so
the
district
court
carefully
looked
at
the
evidence
that
had
been
presented,
and
the
district
court
decided
the
case
really
because
the
testimony
of
chavez
at
the
time
the
tape
recordings
that
he
made
on
the
day
of
the
incident
and
his
deposition
testimony...
he
said
simply,
i'm
investigating
the
crime.
i
was
there
to
investigate
what...
the
crime
had
been
committed,
the
crime
of
attempted
murder
on
two
police
officers
on
the
theory
that
somehow
or
other
this
farm
worker
had
taken
away
the
officer's
gun
and
was
going
to
use
it
on
the
officers
when
they
shot
him.
that
was
the
core
of
the
case.
that
was
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case.
the
subsequent
declarations
that
were
submitted
were
only
submitted
after...
after
mr.
martinez
submitted
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
using
all
of
the
evidence
provided
by
the
defense
and
giving
them
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
on
all
the
evidence,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
there
may
be
a
violation,
and...
and
i
would
agree
that
most
likely
if...
if
it
was
in
violation
of
miranda,
there
would
be...
there
would
be
no...
it
would
not
be
admitted
into
a
criminal
case.
maybe...
it
may
be
under
the
quarles
exception.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
no.
no,
i
think
clearly
that's
the
kind
of
a
case
in
which
qualified
immunity
was
designed
to
prevent.
qualified
immunity
gives
as...
as
it
did
in...
in--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--then...
then
clearly--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--oh,
no,
no.
i
would
say--
[laughter]
i...
i
would
say
quarles
gives
us
the
direction.
when
there
is
an
immediate
danger,
when
there's
a
danger
to
the
public,
then
clearly
there
would
be
no
constitutional
violation.
the
court
has
already
made
that
decision.
i...
i
don't
think
that
that's
really
an
issue
that
we
have
to
struggle
with.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
that's
what
quarles,
i
believe,
says.
quarles
says
that...
that
the
miranda
violation
was
not...
was
not
sufficient.
and
i...
as
i...
as
i
recall
in
quarles,
the
evidence
was
admitted
against
him.
he...
he
said,
the
gun
is
over
there,
and
that
evidence
came
in
to
prove
the
violation
of...
of
possession
of
a
weapon.
so
i
think
that
the
court
implicitly
said
that
we're...
in
this
emergency
situation,
that
there
is
no...
no
fifth
amendment--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--no.
what
i...
i
think
once
it
becomes
coercive,
once
it
becomes
physical,
once
it
becomes...
then
i
think
that
you
would
interfere
with
the
core
values
of...
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
i...
i
would
say
yes
that
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
the
question
then
would
be,
what
is
the
remedy?
under
those--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--no.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--and
i
don't
believe
that's...
that
would
be
the
conclusion
because
the
remedy
would
not
be
appropriate
because
there
had
been,
as
we
saw
in...
in
saucier
versus
katz,
there's
a
situation
in
which
the
police
have
to
act,
and
so
the
police
act
if
it's
reasonable,
even
if
it's
a
reasonable
mistake,
even
if
they
have
the
wrong
guy
and
they
try
to
coerce
the
wrong
person,
it
may
be
reasonable
under
an
emergency
circumstance.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
i
would
hope
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
no.
i
think--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--your
honor,
only
in
the
limited
situation.
i
think
the
first
hypothetical
you
gave
me...
gave
us
was
you
simply
were
going
to
ask
him
questions
repeatedly.
now,
i...
i
don't
think
the
rubber
hose
example
was
before
me.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
i
would
agree
with
that
analysis.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
the
distinct...
the
distinct
difference
in
this
case
is...
and
i
understand
that
the
exigence
is...
the
exigent...
the...
the
terrorist
situation
is
a
difficult
one.
it's
not
our
case.
mr.
martinez
was
riding
a
bicycle
home.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
there
was
no
call.
there
was
no
crime.
there
was
nothing
that
had
happened
except
he
was
riding
his
bicycle
home.
so
we
really
can't...
i
don't
think
that
this
is
an
appropriate
vehicle.
there
may
be
such
a
case
that
will
at
some
time--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--i
did...
i
did
consider
that.
and...
and
i
think
clearly
it
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation
under
all
the
cases--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--yes.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
yes,
justice
o'connor,
it
was.
it
was...
it
was...
that
was
the
allegations
from...
from
the
beginning.
but...
but--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--correct.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
yes.
i
believe
it
does.
i
believe
the
history...
and
the
history...
the
early
cases,
the...
the
bram
case
in
1897
began
with
the
concept
of
the...
of
the
fifth
amendment
protecting
all
of
the
rights.
and
of
course,
bram
was
a
case
in
which...
it
was
against
the
united
states.
but
as...
as...
there's
an
evolution
that
i've...
i've
seen
through
our
cases
that...
that
show
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
once
it
was
incorporated,
it
actually
incorporated
the
fifth
amendment
privileges.
it
actually...
the
fifth
amendment
was
really
the...
the
core
values
of
what
the
constitution
meant
to
embody.
it
goes
back
to...
bram
cites
the
early...
early
cases
in
england
where,
although
the
right
against
self-incrimination
was
an
evidentiary
rule,
in
bram
they...
they
laud
the
fact
that
it
became
a
constitutional
rule,
that
it
became
immutable
so
that
no
act
of
congress...
as
we
decided
in
dickerson
not
too
long
ago,
no
act
of
congress
could
change
that.
so--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--i
would--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--i
would
disagree
with
you
on
one
point,
and
that
is
the...
the
language
of
the
amendment
talks
about
a
criminal
case,
and
in
our
brief,
we
did
talk
about
the
meaning,
the
distinction
between
a
criminal
trial
and
a
criminal
case.
and
all
of
the...
all
of
the
language...
the
most
recent
is
in
hubbell.
there's
the
discussion
about
the
fact
that
the
fifth
amendment
covers...
the
values
of
the
fifth
amendment
covers
everything
from
civil
to
administrative
to
bankruptcy
cases.
the
arnstein
case
in
1923
talked
about
the
fifth
amendment
protecting
a
bankrupt
person
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
not
even
involving
a
criminal
proceeding
at
all.
so
the
extension
of
the
fifth
amendment
goes
to
really
the
core
values.
we
just
don't
force
people
to
talk,
and
the
state
can't
do
it.
and--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--that
was
the
holding
in
arnstein
in...
in
1923,
and
a
bankrupt
person
who
was
under
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
simply
said,
i
have
a
right
to
remain
silent.
i
don't
want
to
answer
these
questions.
the
court
upheld
that
right
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
so
early
law
certainly
didn't...
didn't
say
it
had--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--they
may--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
but...
but
there
was
no
criminal
proceeding--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--i--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--and...
and
once
the...
the
right
has
been
given
to
the...
to
the
american
people
to
plead
the
fifth
amendment
in
any
pre-trial
proceeding,
including
an...
an
interrogation
at...
after
a...
after
a
shooting
such
as
this,
and
after
the
person
is
the
sole
suspect
of
a
horrible
crime,
then
obviously
that
is
part
of
the
criminal
case.
that
is
part
of
the
entire
criminal
process.
if
we
would
say
we
only
have
a
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent
if
we
introduce
it
into
a
court...
into
a
court
proceeding,
then
mr....
persons
like
mr.
martinez
who
were
never
charged
with
a
crime
would
have
no
remedy.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
i
agree.
i
agree,
justice
scalia.
i
think
it's
important
that
we
try
to
focus
on
what
really
are
the
bright
lines
here.
we
have
three
bright
lines
that
were
violated
by...
by
sergeant
chavez
in
this
case.
the
first
is
clearly
coercion
that
goes
back
to...
to
the
early
cases.
the
second
bright
line
is
that
there
was...
there
was
an
invocation
in
this
case.
mr.
martinez
twice
said,
i
don't
want
to
talk.
leave
me
alone
until
they
give
me
medical
treatment.
there
was
invocations
implicitly.
when
he
first
opened
his
mouth,
he
says,
leave
me
alone.
leave
me
alone.
i'm
dying.
those
are
the
first
words
out
of
his
mouth.
that's
an
invocation.
no
reasonable
police
officer,
no...
no
basically
trained
police
officer
could
believe
that
questioning
a
fellow
in
his
condition
was
permissible.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
then
it's
clearly...
he's
not
a
suspect.
clearly,
it...
questioning
is...
is
obviously
needed.
it's
necessary.
of
course.
but...
but--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--because
he's--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--because
he's
not
a
suspect.
because
he's...
he
isn't
the
sole--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--i
think
not.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
it
is.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
because
the...
the
constitutional
obligation.
when
the
person
is
a
suspect,
the
constitutional
obligation
rises
above.
that's
the
difference.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
no,
i
would
think
not.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
i
think
the
proper
result
is...
is
given...
given
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
the
proper
result
is
if
this
is
a...
a
witness
who
has
information
about
some
exigent
circumstance,
then
there...
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
attach
at
all.
and
obviously
the
officer
is
not
going
to
use
leading
questions,
coercive
questions
to
get
information.
the
basic
concept
of
getting
information
under
those
circumstances
is
you
want
it
to
be
trustworthy.
you
don't
want
the
officer
putting
words
into
the
person's
mouth
and
brow-beating
them
to
come
up
with
something
that's
a
bad
lead.
so
obviously
we
want
to
have
the
kind
of
questioning
that
would
be,
in
fact,
seeking
the
truth
as
opposed
to
putting
words
into
someone's
mouth
as
what
occurred
in
this
case.
the...
i'd
like
to
address
a
point
that's
been
raised,
and...
and
it
may
not
be
totally
necessary.
i'd
just
like
to
make
the
distinction
that
the...
the
basis,
the
entire
heart
of
the
discussion
that
coercion
is
somehow
permissible
unless
the
cases
are
introduced
into
a
criminal
case
or
into
a
criminal
trial
are...
are
the...
the
immunity
cases.
in
the
immunity
cases,
they...
they...
i
believe
that
the
defense
has...
or
that
the
petitioners
have
totally
confused
the
grant
of
immunity
and
coercion
in
a
public
trial
after
a
grant
of
immunity
where
a
person
is
told,
you
must
answer
the
questions.
and...
and
the
distinctions
is
one
is
an
inquisitional
situation
where
if
the
officer
has
a
person
alone
and
they're
forcing
them
to
answer
questions,
there
is
no
public
trial,
there
is
no
judge
there
to
make
sure
that
they're...
they're
not
being...
there
is
no
overreaching,
there
is
no
brow-beating.
the
person
who
was
even
under
a
grant
of
immunity
can
say,
i'm
not
going
to
talk,
and
face
the
consequences
of
going
to
jail
and
sit
in
jail
with
dignity
and
say,
i'm
not
going
to
talk.
i
believe
that
it's
more
important
to
assert
my
right
not
to
speak
than
to
be...
than...
than
sitting
in
jail.
our
law
still
doesn't
allow
the
court
or
the
jailers
to
use
coercion
to
extract
their
statement.
a
person
in
this
country
still
could
have
the
dignity
to
say
i
don't
want
to
speak
and
i'll
take
the
punishment,
and
if
it's
just
punishment,
that
it's
been
done
by
a
court,
then
that
is
not
coercion,
the
kind
of
inquisitional
coercion
that
this...
that
this
court
and
the
united
states
has
always
said
we
don't
tolerate.
are
there
any
other
questions?
mr.
richard
s.
paz
i
believe
that
there
can
be
some
questioning,
and
i
think
that
the
questioning
has
to
be...
even
if
it's
forceful
questioning,
there
must
be
limits.
and
it's...
certainly
it's
a
balance
because
it
has
to
take
into
account
what
is
the
circumstance
of
this
person.
the
danger
in
saying
i
agree
with
that
hypothetical,
your
honor,
is
that
what
if
the
person
is
the
wrong
person.
what
if
the
suspect
really
isn't
the
person
who
kidnapped
the
person?
what
if
they're
just
wrong
and
they
got
the
wrong
person?
that's
the
danger,
and
that's
why
we
have
to--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--that's
correct.
and
it's...
it's
always
a
difficult
choice,
but
we
have...
we
have
to--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--then
i
think...
i
think
that
there
is...
we
have
to
look
at
quarles
for
guidance
and,
again,
it
has
to
be
the
degree
of
the...
the
degree
of
coercion
that
is
permissible.
it's
difficult
to
say
that
any
coercion
is
permissible.
but
again,
given...
with
the
limited
hypothetical
and
limited
facts,
it's...
it's
difficult
to
make
a
judgment
at
this
point.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
no,
your
honor.
that...
that
was,
as
i
understood,
that
the...
the
use
immunity
that
was
granted
in...
in
waterfront
was
extensive
with
the
privilege.
it
was
allowed...
that
is,
as
i
understand
the
reading
of
the
case,
was
that
the
privilege
that...
that
the...
the
immunity
that
was
granted
was
sufficient
to
cover
both
any
state
prosecution
as
well
as
federal
prosecution.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
we
all
make
mistakes,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
richard
s.
paz
yes.
mr.
richard
s.
paz
i...
i
think
there
was
good
language
in...
in
colorado
versus
connelly.
justice
o'connor
wrote
a
concurring
opinion
i
think
that
covers
the
point
quite
well
that
said
that...
and
there
was
also
the--
mr.
richard
s.
paz
--as
i
recall,
the...
the
discussion
was
that
there
had
been
an
argument
that
the...
that
mosley's
statement...
that
that
by
using
mosley's
statement,
because
there
had
been
no
police
coercion,
that
it
was
permissible
because
the
purpose
of
the...
of
the
rights,
the
fifth
amendment,
was
to
prevent
police
misconduct
and
coercion.
and...
and
in
that
context
there
was
a...
there
was
a
discussion
about...
that
the...
that
the...
that
there
was...
that
because
the
rights
protect
outside
of
the
criminal
case
and
outside
of
the
trial,
that
there
was
no...
there
would
be
no
deterrence.
there
would
be
no
reason
to
enforce
it
at
that
point.
also
there
was
michigan
versus
tucker.
both
michigan
and...
and
colorado
versus
colony...
connelly
both
discuss
about
a
two-part
inquiry.
should...
should
we...
and
the
court
indicates
in
both
of
those
cases
that
there's
an
analysis
of
whether
the
police
officer
conduct
violated
the
fifth
amendment,
and
then
secondly,
what
is
the
remedy.
so
really,
those
two
cases
talk
about
the
difference
between
the
right
pre-trial
in
the
custodial
interrogation
setting,
as
well
as...
as
does
miranda,
and
the
difference
between
the
remedies
that
the
court
considered.
any
further
questions?
thank
you.
