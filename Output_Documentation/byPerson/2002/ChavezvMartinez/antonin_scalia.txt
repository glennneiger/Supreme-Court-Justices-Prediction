justice
antonin
scalia
but
we...
we
do
somehow
extend
the
fifth
amendment
protection
to
the
period
before
the
actual
introduction
of
the
evidence
in
a
criminal
trial.
that
is
to
say,
we...
we
permit
a
witness
to
refuse
to
answer
unless
the
witness
is
given...
is
given
immunity
from
prosecution.
now,
how
do
you
explain
that,
unless
somehow
the
fifth
amendment
has
some
antecedent
application
before
the
evidence
is
actually--
justice
antonin
scalia
--introduced
at
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
paz,
let
me...
let
me
tell
you
why
i
have
difficulty
with
the
proposition
which
you're
urging,
which
is
that
any
coercion
that
would
suffice
to
require
the
confession
to
be
excluded
from...
from
trial
is
also
a
coercion
that
violates
the
fifth
amendment,
not...
leaving
substantive
due
process
aside.
suppose
you
have
a
situation
in
which
a...
a
felon
has
taken
a
hostage
and
buried
the
hostage
somewhere,
and
suppose
that
it
is
possible
for
the
police
official
to
use
a
degree
of
coercion
which
would
not
shock
the
conscience.
it
isn't
beating
the
person
with
a
rubber
hose,
but
let's
say
failing
to
give
a
miranda
warning,
or
using
a...
a
sort
of
trickery
that...
that
would
amount
to
coercion,
threatening
perhaps,
you
know,
if
you
don't
confess,
your
brother
will
be
prosecuted
or
something
like
that.
it
would
be
sufficient
to
exclude
the
testimony
from
the
confession
from
the
trial,
but
the
policeman
doesn't
care
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you
would
say
that
that...
that
policeman
by
extracting
that
confession
has
violated
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
you'd
say
that
the
person
would...
would
have
a...
a
1983
action
against
the
policeman?
justice
antonin
scalia
only
because
of
qualified
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
violate
the
fifth
amendment
when
there's
a
danger
to
the
public?
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
think
this
applies
not
only
to
the...
the
unique
aspect
of
the
fifth
amendment
that...
that
miranda
constitutes,
but
to
all
fifth
amendment
violations.
justice
antonin
scalia
coercion
to
keep
it
out
of
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
--section
1983.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
it's
a
fifth
amendment
violation,
you
can
sue
the
policeman.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
person
who
goes
to
prison
for...
for
putting
this
person
in
a...
in
a
grave
begins
a
suit
when
he's
in
prison
suing
the...
suing
the
policeman.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
so
let's
assume
somebody
is...
you
think
he's
going
to
blow
up
the
world
trade
center.
i
suppose
if...
if
we
have
this
necessity...
this
necessity
exception,
you...
you
could
beat
him
with
a
rubber
hose.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it's
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
since
when
is...
is
necessity
a...
you
know,
a
justification
for
ignoring
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know...
okay.
do
you
know
any
of
our...
any
of
our
cases
that...
other
than
miranda
which,
you
know,
is...
is
in
a
field
by
itself,
do
you
know
any
of
our
cases
that
say
that
there
is
a
necessity
exception
to
the
coercion
prohibition
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
my
hypothetical
was
not
miranda.
my
hypothetical
was
that
he
was
coerced
in
some
fashion
other
than
the
failure
to
give
a
miranda
warning,
and
short
of
beating
with
a
rubber
hose.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i...
you...
you
mean...
you
say
it
extends
to
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
you
mean
you
can
refuse
to
provide
testimony
that
can
be
used
against
you
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding?
justice
antonin
scalia
simply
because
he
didn't
want
to
answer
the
questions,
or
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the...
the
questions
would
incriminate
him--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
a
criminal
proceeding.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well...
yes.
there
wasn't
any
yet
pending.
i
mean,
i
think
we
all
understand
that
you...
that
you
acquire
some
pre-trial
fifth
amendment
rights
to...
to
remain
silent,
but
whether
that
means
that
there
has
been
a
fifth
amendment
violation
before
the
entrance
is...
evidence
is
introduced
in
trial
is...
is
a
separate
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
nobody
questions
that...
that
there
are
some
aspects
of
our
fifth
amendment
law
which...
which
allow
you
to
plead
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
evidence
has
been
introduced
in
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
part
of
the
criminal
case.
i
mean,
as...
as
your
bankruptcy
example
indicates.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
difficult
at
all
if
they
know
that
this
is
the
fellow
that
did
the...
they
have
all
sorts
of
evidence.
they
know
this
is
the
guy
that...
that
buried
the
child,
or
deprived
the
child
of
medication
or
whatever.
it's
not
a
hard
question
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
paz,
what
do
you...
what
do
you
do
with
the
murphy
case
that's
relied
upon
so
extensively
by...
by
mr.
robbins?
as
i
understand
that
case,
it
was
a
state
legislative
commission
which
accorded
immunity
to
the
witness
under
state
law,
but
of
course
could
not
accord
immunity
under
federal
law.
and
we
held
that
the
witness,
nonetheless,
had
to
testify,
and
we
said,
of
course,
if
the
feds
try
to
use
the
evidence,
it
will
not
be
admissible
because
it
was...
it
was
obtained
under
coercion.
but
we,
nonetheless,
allowed
the
state
to
compel
the
testimony.
now,
were
we
allowing
a
fifth
amendment
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no.
that
wasn't
the
case.
that
was
the
whole
problem.
the
state
could
not
grant
immunity
from
federal
prosecution.
it...
it
granted
immunity
only
from
state
prosecution.
and
we
said,
nonetheless,
the
state
could...
could
lock
the
person
up
until
he
testified.
and
the
only
consequence
would
be
that
if
he
did
testify,
it
would
not
be
introducible
in
federal
trial
because
it...
it
had
been
coerced.
now,
i...
you
know,
it's
a
bizarre
case,
but
it
does
seem
to
stand
for
the
principle
that
mr.
robbins
asserts,
which
is
that
there's
no
fifth
amendment
violation
until
the
evidence
is
introduced.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think...
you
think
that
was
one
of
our
mistakes.
