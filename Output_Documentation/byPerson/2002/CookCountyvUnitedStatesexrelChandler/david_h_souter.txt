didn't...
didn't
we
recognize
it
in
the
amity
case
in
1826?
we...
we
quoted
sir
edward
cook
in
including
municipal
corporations
as...
as
persons.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
sure
that's
true
but
why...
why
do
you...
why
is
it
that,
in
your
opinion,
nobody
apparently
with...
just,
perhaps
no
exceptions,
or
one
or
two,
has
ever
sued
a
local
government
before
under
this
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
a
handful,
virtually
no...
none.
it's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--since
1986,
that's
already
16
years,
and
there
are
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
federal
programs
that
go
to
cities,
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
imagine
somewhere
in
those
billions
there
are
a
few
false
statements
being
made
by
people.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
sort
of
federalized
this
action.
i
mean,
you're
going
to
let
the
private
plaintiffs
go
out,
sue
all
the
cities,
and
if
you
think
there's
something
wrong
here,
you
will
step
in
and
deal
with
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
respondent,
janet
chandler,
used
to
supervise
a
medical
research
study
for
cook
county
hospital
funded
by
$5,000,000
grant
from
the
national
institute
of
drug
abuse.
because
chandler
believed
that
the
county
had
violated
certain
terms
of
the
grant
relating
to
research
protocols,
she
sued
the
county
under
the
false
claims
act.
so
far
as
it
concerns
us
here,
the
false
claims
act
imposes
civil
penalties
on
any
person,
those
are
its
words,
who
knowingly
presents
a
fraudulent
claim
to
the
federal
government.
the
government
itself
can
sue
for
fraud
but
a
private
plaintiff
like
chandler
may
sue
also
by
bringing
what
is
known
as
a
qui
tam
suit
on
the
government's
behalf.
if
she
succeeds,
she
may
get
up
to
30%
of
the
proceeds
for
herself.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
local
governments
like
cook
county
are
persons
subject
to
qui
tam
suits
under
the
false
claims
act.
in
the
steven’s
case
decided
three
terms
ago,
we
held
that
person
does
not
include
states.
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
municipalities
are
nonetheless
covered,
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
affirm.
the
term
"person"
is
not
defined
in
the
act
but
the
word
has
been
in
the
statutes
since
it
was
enacted
in
1863.
we
have
no
trouble
concluding
that
the
term
then
included
municipalities.
the
common
understanding
going
back
at
least
to
cook’s
institute
was
that
corporations
including
municipal
corporations
were
deemed
to
be
artificial
persons
for
statutory
purposes.
of
course
congress
could
have
given
a
word
a
narrower
definition
than
the
usual
one
just
described
but
nothing
in
the
act's
text
or
history
leads
us
to
think
that
it
did.
we
also
conclude
that
nothing
in
the
1986
amendments
to
the
false
claims
act
repealed
municipal
liability.
to
be
sure
those
amendments
raised
the
ceiling
on
damages
from
double
to
treble
damages,
the
change
that
the
steven’s
case
described
has
turned
what
had
been
a
remedial
provision
into
a
punitive
one.
the
county
argues
that
because
local
governments
enjoy
common
law
immunity
from
punitive
damages,
congress'
adoption
of
treble
damages
should
be
read
as
implied
repeal
of
municipal
liability,
but
the
punitive
nature
of
the
treble
damages
under
the
act
is
modest
and
it
therefore
offers
only
limited
support
for
the
argument
that
congress
must
have
repealed
the
act
in
so
far
as
it
covered
municipalities.
to
the
contrary,
the
clear
purpose
of
the
1986
amendments
was
to
strengthen
the
government’s
hand
in
fighting
all
fraud
which
local
governments
are
capable
of
committing
when
they
receive
and
administer
federal
funding.
we
conclude
that
municipal
liability
existed
under
the
original
false
claims
act
and
that
the
1986
amendments
did
not
implicitily
eliminate
it.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
