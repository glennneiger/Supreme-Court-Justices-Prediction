ms.
donnal
m.
lach
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
today...
presented
today
turns
on
whether
congress
intended
to
include
local
governments
within
the
meaning
of
the
false
claims
act's
undefined
term,
person,
which
this
court
determined
in
stevens
has
remained
unchanged
since
the
original
enactment
in
1863.
the
indications
are
that
congress
did
not
subject
local
governments
to
liability
under
the
1863
act,--
as
this
court
observed
in
stevens
and
in
hubbard
versus
united
states,
the
1863
act
was
enacted
as
a
criminal
statute.
it
imposed
criminal
fines
or
imprisonment
in
addition
to
civil
damages
and
forfeitures.
as
this
court
noted
in
marcus
v.
hess,
any
language
that
the
civil
portion
shares
in
common
with
the
criminal
portion
must
be
given
careful
scrutiny
lest
those
not
intended
are
brought
within
the
act's
reach.
the
word,
persons,
subject
to
liability,
is
shared
by
both
the
civil
and
the
criminal
provisions
of
the
1863
act,
thus,
a
person
that
could
be
held
liable
civilly
must,
under
the
1863
act,
necessarily
be
capable
of
being
subject
to
the
criminal
provision
as
well.
this
court,
in
city
of
newport,
noted
that
municipal
corporations
were
not
considered
capable
of
doing
a
criminal
act
or
a
malicious
or
willful
wrong...
excuse
me.
the...
the
criminal
nature
of
the
statute
in
itself
is
a
strong
indication
that
congress
did
not
include
local
governments
within
the
purview
of
the
statute.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
this
court
determined
that
the...
the
antitrust
statutes,
under
the
antitrust
statutes
the
term,
person,
does
include
municipalities,
local
governments.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
that
is
true,
but
we
are
unaware
of
any
case
in
which
a
local
government
has
been
prosecuted
as
a
criminal.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
yes.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
this
court
in
the
city
of
lafayette
and
city
of
boulder,
in
analyzing
the
term,
person,
and
determining
that
municipalities
were
included
within
that
term,
were
also
faced
with
the
treble
damages
of
the...
of
the
clayton
act,
and
subsequent
to
those
two
decisions,
congress
enacted
the
local
government
antitrust
act
of
1984,
in
which
congress
specifically
took
local
governments
out
of
the
range
of
the
treble
damages,
and
now
local
governments
are
subject
to
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
yes.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
yes,
that
is...
that
is
what
we're
arguing.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
it
does
not
appear
to
be
true
of
the
sherman
act,
but
again,
we
are
not
aware
of
any
case
in
which
a
local
government
was
prosecuted
under
that
act.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
any
more...
that's
true,
but
now,
ever
since
1878,
the
false
claims
act
has
been
bifurcated.
the
criminal
provisions
are
separately
codified
from
the
civil
provisions.
also,
as
this
court
noted
in
stevens
in
1863,
the
false
claims
act
was
enacted
to
combat
fraud
during
the
civil
war
by
private
contractors,
and
there
is
no
indication
that
in
1863
the
federal
government
was
buying
anything
from
local
governments,
or
that
there
were
any
federal
contracts
with
local
governments,
and
without
a
practice
of
federal
funding
to
local
governments,
congress
would
have
no
reason
to
envision
a
local
government
submitting
a
false
claim
for
payment,
nor
were
local
governments
firmly
established
as
persons
in
19...
excuse
me,
in
1863.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
not
at
all.
not
at
all,
and
in
fact,
in...
in
1863,
the
term,
person,
presumptively
included
private
corporations,
and
there
is
language
in
the
1863
act,
and
given
the
context
of
the
act,
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
private
corporations
were
included
in
the
provisions.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
the...
the
cases
at
that
time
were...
came
from
state
courts,
and
the
state
courts
were
not
consistent
throughout...
throughout
the
nation
as
to
when
local
governments
could
be
held
liable.
some
state
courts
held
they
could
be
held
liable
in
contract,
others
in
tort,
and
even
when
held
liable
in
tort,
there
was
sometimes
the
distinction
between
proprietary
and
governmental
function.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
louisville
and
letson,
though,
only
applied
to
private
corporations,
and
private
corporations
were
established
by
that
1844
case,
but
in...
this
court
did
not
extend
that
principle
until
the
1869
decision
in
cowles,
and
that
was
the
first
time--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--yes,
but
still,
in
terms...
this
court,
in
the
cowles
decision
in
1869,
believed
that
it
still
was
not
a
settled
issue
and...
and
settled
the
issue
once
and
for
all.
in
the
amity
case,
it
was
not...
it
was
not...
the
issue
that
was
before
the
court
that
needed
to
be
decided,
whether
local
governments
were
persons
unlike
in
the
cowles
case--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--yes,
but
by
saying
that,
this
court
in
monell
dated
the
presumption
as
firmly
established
as
of
the
1869
cowles
decision,
rather--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--i
think
that--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--well,
it
doesn't...
it
wasn't
an
automatic
or
a
dramatic
change,
but
nonetheless,
there
was
a
progression.
there
was...
there
was
a
transition
in
law
within
the
states.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
those
6
years,
of
all
6
years
in
this
country's
history,
of
course,
were
the
most
significant,
but...
but
in
terms
of
dating
a
presumption
that
one
can
firmly
rely
on,
there
is
no
firm
date,
other
than
1869,
in
which
acts
of
congress
were
determined
to
include
person
as
a...
include
municipality
within
the
word,
person.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
yes,
it
was.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
perhaps,
but
nonetheless
the
court
did
decide
the
issue,
and
made...
made
it
clear
that
for
once...
once
and
for
all,
this
issue
was
being
decided,
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
no
ambiguity
was
left.
the
first
case
that
ever...
that...
in
which
a
local
government
was
ever
brought
before
this
court
was
in
1861,
in
the
aspinwall
case,
and
there
the
issue
did
not
arise,
and
subsequent
to
the
1863
act,
yes,
there
were
other
cases
in
which
local
governments
were
brought
before
this
court,
but
the
issue
never
arose.
it
wasn't
until
1869
that
we
can
firmly
date
when,
in...
in
federal...
in...
in
congressional
enactments,
we
can
presume
that
the
word
person
included
local
governments.
and
this
court
in
monell
observed
that
it
took
years
of
judicial
conflict
before
corporations
of
all
sorts,
including
municipal
corporations,
were
established
as
persons
that
could
sue
and
be
sued
in
federal
court.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
if
this
court
determines
that
the
word,
person,
in
1863
did,
in
fact--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--include
local
government,
that--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--the...
the...
what
would
change
it
is
congress'
imposition
of
treble
damages,
which
this
court
has
noted--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--exactly.
exactly,
and
the
1986
amendments
were
just
that.
they
were
amendments.
what
was
not
changed
in
1986
remained
the
same.
nonetheless,
when
congress
provided
for
treble
damages,
which
this
court
has
determined
to
be
punitive,
congress
knew
what
this
court
said
in
city
of
newport.
this
court
reiterated
a
presumption
that
local
governments
are
immune
from
the
imposition
of
punitive
damages
unless
congress
specifically
indicates
otherwise.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
well,
under
the
1863
act,
there
were
only
double
damages,
which
this
court
concluded
were
remedial,
and
they
were
not
punitive,
but
there
was
a
big
step
made
in
18...
1986,
when
congress
changed
the
remedy
to
mandatory
treble
damages
and,
in
addition
to
that,
increased
the
statutory
fines.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
but
there
were
indications
prior
to
that
that...
that...
from
which
congress
understood
that
the
damages
were
punitive.
in
1981,
this
court,
in
texas
industries,
a
case
that
was
cited
in
stevens,
stated
that
treble
damages
are
meant
to
punish,
and
also
in
1981,
in
city
of
newport,
this
court
cited
an
1877
a
missouri
supreme
court
case
that
held
that
a
municipality
was
not
subject
to
treble
damages
under
a
trespass
statute,
notwithstanding
that
statute's
general
authorization
for
such
damages
against
any
person,
and
the
reason
was,
treble
damages
were
exemplary,
and--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--the
court...
the
court
noted
both.
the
court
said
in...
in
aspect,
they
are
remedial,
but
then,
also
they
did
have
an
intent
to
punish
as
well,
but
as
i
stated,
the...
the
clayton
act
no
longer
applies
to
local
governments
because
congress
took
affirmative
steps--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--it
was
a
dramatic
expansion,
but
as
this
court--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--well,
we
believe
that
congress
did
not
cut
back,
that...
that
local
governments
were
never
subject
to
the
act,
but
with
this
dramatic
expansion,
there
was
also
the
dramatic
increase
in
damages,
and
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
local
governments
have
an
affirmative
defense
when
punitive
damages
are
at
stake,
and
in
order
to
abrogate
that
immunity
from
punitive
damages,
congress
has
got
to
really
say
that
it
intends
to
impose
those
punitive
damages,
treble
damages
in
this
case,
treble
damages
plus
statutory
fines
in
this
case
on
local
governments,
and
there's
no
indication
anywhere
on
the
face
of
the
1986
amendments
that
congress
intended
to
impose
such
damages
on
local
governments.
local
governments
are
mentioned
twice
in
the
1986
amendments.
in
one
provision,
it's
the
jurisdictional
provision,
3732(b),
which
allows
local
governments
and
states
to
bring
state
court
claims
in
federal
court
when...
when
the
transaction
arises
from
the
same
transaction
as
a
false
claims
act
action.
that
indicates
that
congress
was
interested
in...
in
preventing
frauds
against
local
governments,
not
in...
in
imposing
punitive
damages
on
local
governments,
and
the
other
provision
is
the
cid
provision
which,
as
this
court
noted
in
stevens,
has
a...
has
a
definition.
that
definition
includes
states
and
political
subdivisions
of
states,
but
that
is
for
the
purpose
of
investigation--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--but
the...
but
the
point
is
that
where
local
governments
are
mentioned
in
the...
in
the
false
claims
act
in
the
1986
amendment,
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
was
mentioning
them
because
congress
was
intending
to
abrogate
the
immunity
from
punitive
damages.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
well,
that's
less
clear
under
the
false
claims
act.
this
court...
i...
i
know
that
your
honor,
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
suggested
that
the
term,
person,
is
different
in
30...
3730(b)
from
3730(a).
it's
less
clear,
i
think,
perhaps,
but
that
was
an
issue
that
this
court
expressly
declined
to
address
in
stevens
because
there
was
no
need
to
discuss
it
or
to
decide
it
at
that
point.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
i
think
perhaps
local
governments
could
bring
qui
tam
actions,
but...
but
it
is
not
clear.
there
are
also
the...
the
policy
considerations
with
respect
to
the
imposition
of
punitive
damages
on
local
governments.
local
governments
apply
for
and
use
federal
funds
for
the
benefit
of
their
residents
and,
as
this
court
noted
in
stevens,
in
city
of
newport,
the
court
was
concerned
with
the
imposition
of
punitive
damages
on
local
taxpayers
under
any
circumstances,
and
here
we
have
a
statute
that
imposes
three
times
the
amount
of
damages
and
imposes
statutory
fines,
which
get
very
hefty.
punitive
damages
against
a
local
government
have
got
to
come
from
someplace,
and
there
are
only
two
places,
reduction
in
services,
or
an
increase
in
taxes,
and
the
victims
of
punitive
damages
are
not
the
wrongdoers.
they're...
they're
the
innocent,
and
some
of
those
innocents
are
not
even
taxpayers
or
voters,
such
as
schoolchildren
or
homeless
medically
indigent.
the
united
states
significantly...
significantly
has
other
means
to
stop
fraud
by
local
governments,
and
to
deter
local
governments
from
committing
fraud.
the
united
states
has
common
law
causes
of
action
to
be
made
whole,
and
the
most
effective
deterrent
is
the
threat
of
debarment
from
participation
in
federal
funding.
with
no
indication
that
congress
ever
intended
to
include
local
governments
in
the...
in
the
1863
act,
and
with
the
dictionary
act
not
being
enacted
until
1871,
where
congress
for
the
first
time
created
a
statutory
presumption
that
the
word,
person,
includes
bodies
politic
and
corporate,
this
case
is
in
a
very
different
posture
from
the
monell
case.
in
monell,
this
court
did
not
just
look
at
the
word,
person.
this
court
looked
at
the
historical
environment
in
which
section
1983
was
enacted,
it
looked
at
the
legislative
history,
and
it
also
looked
at
the
dictionary
act,
which
was
enacted
just
2
months
prior
with
the
same...
by
the
same
congress
that
enacted
section
1983.
a
review
of
the
circumstances
around
the
1863
enactment,
together
with
the
text
and
the
historical
context,
leads
the
other
way.
there
was
no
concrete
presumption.
there
were...
there
were
indications,
yes,
but
does
that
lead...
does
that
add
up
to
a
presumption?
there's
no
concrete
presumption
until
this
court
said
so
in
cowles
in
1869,
and
then
we
have
congress
in
1871.
there
were
changes.
there
were
articulations
at
that...
at
that
point
in
time.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
thank
you.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
thank
you.
the
first
point
i'd
like
to
address
is
mr.
miner's
point
that
local
governments
were
sued
in
all
types
of
tort
actions
across
the
board.
congress'
understanding
of
the
suability
of
municipalities,
and
municipalities
as
persons
in
1863
was
really
dependent
on
state
law,
because
there
had
been
no
federal
expression
up
until
that
time,
and
across
the
board
in
the
states,
local
governments
were
viewed
differently.
some...
some
local
governments
were
viewed
as
quasi
corporations
and
some
as
municipal
corporations
with
different
levels
of
liability
and,
as
i
noted
earlier,
some
states
made
a
distinction
between
proprietary
and
government
functions,
so
congress'
understanding
based
on
state
law
at
that
time
was
not
consistent
enough
to
be
evidence
that
congress
understood
person
to
include
local
governments.
as
for
state
criminal
actions,
in
some
states
there
were
misdemeanor
actions
against
local
governments
for
nuisance
actions
such
as
failure
to
maintain
a
bridge,
but
there
is
no
common
law
with
respect
to...
to
federal
statutes.
when...
when
congress
enacts
a
criminal
statute,
the
states'
understanding
of...
of
who
is
a
person
subject
to
state
criminal
statutes
is
not
dispositive
of
what
congress
had
in
mind,
and
if
it
is
ambiguous
and
it
is
inconclusive,
as
justice
breyer
suggested,
it
might
be
what...
what
congress
was
actually
thinking
in
1863.
criminal
statutes
are
interpreted
narrowly,
and--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--yes.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
well,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
county
was
not
her
employer.
the...
our
codefendant,
hektoen
institute
for
medical
research,
was
her
employer.
cook
county
has
been
dismissed
from
that
count,
but...
but--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--well,
the
term
employer
is
not
defined
in
the
false
claims
act,
but
just
very
recently,
2
weeks
ago,
on
december
31,
the
eighth
circuit
reached
this
issue
and,
without
reaching
the
question
of
what
person
means
under
the
false
claims
act,
the
eighth
circuit
determined
that
employer
has
a
broader
meaning,
and
allowed
an
action
to
proceed
against
a
local
government,
in
that
case
the
st.
louis
housing
authority
under,
only
under
the
whistleblower
provision,
and
so
the
whistleblower
provision
in
itself
does
not
indicate
that
local
governments,
even
if
an
employee
can
sue
a
municipal
entity
under
the
whistleblower
provision,
that
does
not
automatically
mean
that--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--the
false
claims
act
actions
may
be
caused
by
another
party.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
yes.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
but...
but
in
this
case--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--not
against
the
county,
but
she
still
has
a
retaliation
claim
against
her
employer.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
under
the
false
claims
act.
there
were
two
defendants
in
this
case,
cook
county
and
the
institution
that
administered
the
grant,
and
that
institution
employed
janet
chandler,
and
so--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--it's
a
not-for-profit.
it's
a
not-for-profit
corporation,
and
so
that
defendant
is
in
the
case,
and--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--no,
under
the
eighth
circuit
case
a
municipality
can
be
held
liable
under
the
whistleblower
provision,
even
though...
i
mean
to
sound
very
exact--
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
--yes.
ms.
donnal
m.
lach
the
cases
that
have
addressed
this
have
noted
there...
a
local
government
can
be
in
cahoots
with
another...
another
entity
that
submits
false
claims,
the...
the
local
government
is
aware
of
it,
and
the
whistleblower
is
an
employee
of
the
local
government.
in
that
case,
it
is...
in
that
scenario,
the
whistleblower
is
blowing
the
whistle
on
someone
else
and
yet
is
employed
by
the
local
government
and,
under
this...
under
the
court's
reasoning
in...
in
the
eighth
circuit
case
and
in
the
two
cases
that
we
cited,
satalich
and
erie
county,
an
action
can
still
proceed
against
a
local
government
under
3730(h),
even
though
a
local
government
is
not
necessarily
a
person
subject
to
suit.
to
get...
to
get
back
to
the
points,
a
lawsuit
under
the
false
claims
act
can
be
brought
if
a
statement
is
made
in
reckless
disregard.
mr.
miner
suggested
that
the
statement
has
to
be
clearly
false,
deliberately
false,
and
under
the
1986
amendments,
the
standard
has
been
reduced
to
reckless
disregard.
as
for
deterrent,
by
the
time
some
of
these
actions
are
filed,
the
wrongdoer
is
not
even
in
office
any
more.
it
is
the
local
taxpayers,
the
local
residents
that
bear
the
brunt
of...
of
any
false
claims
act
action
and
penalty,
not...
not
the
person
that
actually
perpetrated
the
wrong.
when...
when
in
1986
congress
expanded
the
coverage
of
the
false
claims
act,
it
did
not
expand
the
fraudsters.
as
this
court
noted
in
stevens,
the
false
claims
act
covers
just
all
kinds
of
fraud,
but
it
does
not
cover
all
kinds
of
fraudsters,
and
there's
no
indication,
under
our
view,
that
local
governments
were
among
fraudsters
that
are
included
under
this
act.
in
response
to
mr.
stewart,
we
are
not
aware
of
any
dismissals
of
false
claims
act
actions
that
are
brought
against
local
governments.
the...
the
government
has
not
intervened,
obviously,
in...
in
a
number
of
these
false
claims
act
actions,
but
we're
not
aware
of
any
situation
in
which
the
government
has
actually
dismissed
a
claim
against
a
local
government.
these
actions
proceed
and,
even
if...
even
if
the
united
states
wanted
to
dismiss
an
action,
they
would
have
to
justify
their
dismissal
before
the
court,
and
the
same
with
a
settlement.
it
has
to
be
approved
by
the
court.
in
sum,
i
would
like
to
say
that
congress
knows
what
language
it
needs
to
impose
punitive
damages.
if
this
court
finds
that
local
governments
are
included
in
the
1863
act,
congress
did
not
use
the
requisite
language
to
indicate
that
it
meant
to
impose
punitive
damages
on
local
governments
in
1986.
thank
you.
