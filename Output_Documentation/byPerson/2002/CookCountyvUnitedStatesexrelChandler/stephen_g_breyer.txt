why
since
1986
have
we
seen
virtually
no
suits
brought
against
municipalities?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
lots?

justice
stephen

see,
what
i'm
worried
about
in
the
back
of
my
mind
is,
if
the...
assuming
that
the
history
in
the
1860s
is
fairly
inconclusive,
which
is
the
impression
the
briefs
have
left
me
with,
you
can
make
a
good
argument
one
way
or
the
other,
then
i'd
be
worried
about
suddenly
unleashing
potentially
billions
of
dollars
of
liability
as
lawyers
comb
through
the
vast
number
of
federal
programs
that
give
aid
to
cities,
looking
for
someone,
somewhere,
who
has
made
a
false
statement,
and
i'm
sure
there
are
quite
a
few,
at...
at
which
point
the
cities
would
suddenly
discover
vast
liability
for
treble
damages
that
their...
their
citizens
can't
avoid.
you
can't
sell
a
share
in
a
city,
and...
and
so
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
worries
me
practically,
and
i
wish
you'd
talk
about
it
a
little.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
grant
you,
if
the
history
of
this
is
clear,
you
win.
just
in
case,
though,
i'm
left
absolutely
uncertain
about
what
the
right
result
is
on
the
basis
of
what
happened
in
1863,
i
want
to,
just
in
case
it's
relevant,
to
have
in
my
mind
what's
likely
to
occur
in
the
year
2003.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
mean,
if
that's
the
only
answer,
though,
i...
i
begin
to
think...
i
don't
know
how
much
money
is
involved,
but
i
was
trying
to
make
a
guess
and
say,
leaving
out
social
security,
food
stamps
and
that
kind
of
thing,
which
are
individuals,
my
guess
is
there...
probably
it's
in
the
range
of
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
that
go
to
cities,
leaving
those
things
out,
and
you
have
a
few
bad
actors
in
every
program
that
maybe
purposely
make
a
lie
in
a
statement--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
help
preserve
their
job,
i
don't
know
why
they
do
it,
and...
and
there
we
have
suddenly
a
huge
liability
imposed
on
citizens.
now,
i'm
overstating
this
perhaps,
but
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
the
true
dimension
of
that
problem
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
give
the
government
any
remedy
that...
suppose
that
you
think
that
the
particular
qui
tam
action
is
causing
a
lot
of
trouble
in
a
medicare
area,
or
medicaid
area,
and
there
are
hospital
grants,
or...
you
know,
there
are
vast
numbers
of
grants.
can
you
do
anything
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
then,
in
other
words
the
city
would
have
to
come
to
you
and
say,
this
is
a
real
mess
here,
there's
nothing
to
it,
and
let's
settle
it,
and
then
you'd
have
to
get
involved
and...
and
deal
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
do
it,
though.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
have
there
been
a
lot
of
cases
since
1986
against
municipalities?
