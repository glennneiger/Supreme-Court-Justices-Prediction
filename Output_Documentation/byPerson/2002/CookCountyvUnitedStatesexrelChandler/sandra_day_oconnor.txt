--well,
if
we
think
that
it...
that
the
word,
person,
includes
municipal
corporations,
as,
indeed,
i
think
i
do,
based
on
cowles
and
monell,
then
what
changed
it
in
your
view?
why
would
we
now
have
a
different
view?
just
because
of
the
change
in
the
punitive
damages,
the
treble
damages
provision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
on
that
assumption,
then
what
would
change
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
without
an
accompanying
change
in
the
definition
of
person,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
do
have
the
presumption
in
the
city
of
newport
situation
of
not
treating
punitives
as
applicable
to
municipal
corporations.
