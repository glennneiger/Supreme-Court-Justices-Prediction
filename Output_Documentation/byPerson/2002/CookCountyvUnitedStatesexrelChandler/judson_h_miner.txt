mr.
judson
h.
miner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
really
can't
contribute
much
more
to
the
discussion
of
what
congress
meant
by
a
person
in
section...
in
1863,
other
than
to
point
out,
as
we
did
in
our
brief,
that
in
fact,
the
law
in
the
states
prior
to
letson...
and...
and
indeed,
letson
is
the
origin
of
the...
of
the
doctrine,
because
in
letson,
what
the
court
actually
said
was,
a
corporation
is
a
natural
person
for
purposes
of
the
suit
where
it's
incorporated
or
where
it
does
business,
and
the
court
then
goes
on
and
says,
and
that
doctrine
also
applies
to
all
corporations
and
body
politic.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
the...
that's
right.
they...
they
defined
corporations
by
the...
by
the
members,
and...
and
they
could
have
jurisdictions
all
over.
that
then
gets
cleared
up,
and...
and
the
law
was
absolutely
clear
in
all
of
the
states
as
we...
that
we
could
find.
we
found
no
dissenting
opinions
that...
that
held,
that
didn't
hold
that
a
local
government,
whether
it
was
a
corporation,
whether
it
was
a
quasi
corporation,
a
city,
a
county,
wasn't
held
responsible
for
any
obligations
it
had,
whether
by
contract,
whether
by
charter,
whether...
whether
by
statute,
wherever
they
came
from,
and
they
were
also
responsible
for
all
their
wrongful
torts.
so
that
then
brings
us
to
really
what
was
ms.
lach's
starting
point,
this
whole
question
of
the
implications
of
the
criminal
provisions
and,
in
fact,
not
only
the
sherman
act,
but
the
elkins
act
also
includes
criminal
provisions,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
person,
in
that
act,
includes
municipal
corporations,
but
the...
the
question
of
what
is
the
significance
of
including
criminal
penalties
in
1863
has
to
be
answered
in
the
context
of
what
was...
what
was
the...
the
view
in
1863.
unfortunately,
this
argument
really
doesn't
surface
until
the
reply,
and
so
we
haven't
had
a
chance
really
to
brief
it,
but
the
simple
reality
is,
in...
in
the
period
of
18...
in
the
era
of
1863,
indeed
in
the
19th
century,
local
governments
were
treated
just
like
private
corporations,
and
they
were,
indeed,
subject
to
indictment,
and
they
were
subject
to
criminal
punishment
on
the
same
terms
as
local
governments,
and
they
were
often
found
liable
for
acts
that
involved
both
fraud
and
deceit.
since...
since
this
was...
now,
i'd
like
to
read
to
the
court
from
dillon,
who
is
cited
repeatedly
as...
as
one
of
the...
the
scholars
of
the
era,
although
we...
we
have
not
cited
this
passage
because
the
issue
hadn't
come
up
before,
but
in
his
treatise
on
the
law
of
municipal
corporations
he
states,
english
law,
and
in
this
country...
in
the
english
law
and
in
this
country,
quote,
all
corporations,
municipal
as
well
as
private,
which
owe
duties
to
the
public
are
liable
to
indictment
for
malfeasance
as
well
as
nonfeasance
in
respect
to
their
duties.
and,
in
fact,
he
goes
on
to
explain
that
they're
responsible
for
palpable
omissions,
they're
responsible
for
willful
and
corrupt
acts,
and
in
a...
a
leading
case
at
the
turn
of
the
century
called
ludlow
versus
commonwealth,
56
s.w.
2d
958,
the
state
supreme
court
made
clear
that
the
purpose
of
holding
cities
liable
criminally
was,
indeed,
to
punish
them
and
to
deter
future
acts.
that
really
was
the
law
and,
in
fact,
in
a
leading
case
from
our
own
state,
the
illinois
supreme
court,
in
upholding
a
criminal
conviction
against
the
city
of
chicago
for
employing
women
for
more
than
10
hours,
states
in
the
case
of
people
versus
city
of
chicago,
100
n.e.
194,
the
municipality
is
held
to
the
same
degree
of
responsibility
as
an
individual.
in
securing
performance
of
specific
duties
imposed
upon
municipal
corporations,
the
state
has
the
same
power
of
coercion
and
the
same
method
of
redress
in
the
case
of
individuals
or
purely
private
corporations.
that
was
the
law
in
that
era.
that
was
the
law
when
the
false
claims
act
was
passed
and,
in
a
battery
of
cases
which
i
can
bring
to
this
court's
attention,
a
case
called
howard
versus
crawford
county,
12
f
cases
637,
chaplain
versus
the
corporations
of
the
city
of
new
york,
3
paige,
p-a-i-g-e,
chapter
573,
or
the
town
of
plymouth
versus
the
town
of
windsor,
7
vermont
325,
all
cases
that
predate
the
1863
false
claims
act,
local
governments
were
sued
in
lawsuits
for
fraudulent
and
deceitful
conduct
usually
involving
bond
issues,
or
trying
to
avoid
bond
obligations,
often
in
terms
of
their
responsibilities
to
take
care
of
their
indigent
citizens,
and
they
would
then
engage
in
schemes
to
get
their
indigents
into
another
jurisdiction
so
the
other
jurisdiction
would
have
to
pay
for
the
wrong,
sometimes
they
in
fact
had
paid,
gotten
paid,
but
they--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
--oh,
i'm
simply
using
these
as
examples.
i
understand
it's
part
of
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
reply
briefs
by
my
opponent
that
local
government
simply
cannot
have
the
mental
state
of
showing
either
fraud
or
intent
to
deceive,
and...
and
my
point
is
simply,
it
was
not
uncommon
in
those
days
for
local
governments
to
be
perceived
as
doing
fraudulent
or
deceitful
acts.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
oh,
i
think...
there
were
suits
that
were
brought,
and
we
brought--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
--i
think
the
answer
is
two-fold.
number
1,
as
this
court
recognized
in
hess,
it's
really
not
until
the
1940s
that
money
starts--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
--well--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
--but
i
think
the
answer
is
that
the
money
doesn't
start
coming
in
until
19...
until
the
1940s
and
thereafter,
and
in...
in
1943,
after
this
court's
decision
in
hess,
the
false
claims
act
gets
emasculated,
in
the
sense
that
it
becomes
very
difficult
to
bring
false
claims,
particularly
qui
tam
cases.
the
damages
are
substantially
reduced,
and
there
is
dramatic
fall-off
in
false
claims
litigation,
and
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
1986
amendments,
to
generate
new
life
into
it--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
--since
1986?
oh,
there
are--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
--oh,
there
are
lots
of
suits
since
1986.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
oh,
sure.
mr.
judson
h.
miner
well,
i
think
there...
there
are
a
couple
of
answers.
number
1,
i
think
that's...
that
was
congress'
decision
that...
that
it
was
important
to
protect--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
--oh,
i...
i
think
what
is
going
to...
first
of
all,
let's
understand
that
these
cases
are
not
now
brought
on
the
basis
of
negligent
statements,
or
slight
misrepresentations,
but
these
cases
involve...
this
is
a
statute
unlike
section
1983
or
the
sherman
act,
that
really
does
not
involve
itself
in
imposing
any
new
obligations,
any
new
or
unanticipated
responsibilities
on
local
governments.
it
merely
says,
when
you
entered
into
a
contract
with
us,
we're
going
to
hold
you
to
the
deal
that
you
made,
and
if
you
breach
that
deal
in
material
ways,
we're
going
to
try
to
get
our
money
back,
so
there
is...
there
are
protections
in
the
sense
that
it's
not
any
statement
that
gets
litigated
here.
it's
got
to
be
a
serious,
essential
misrepresentation
about
how
that
money
was
used
that
is
at
the
core
of
these
lawsuits,
so
that--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
--well,
i
think--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
--well,
i
don't
think
that...
first,
as
part
of
that
answer,
congress
has
made
a
decision
by
the...
by
increasing
damages
from
double
to
treble,
there
will
be
a
deterrent
effect,
and
that
one
response
of
this
is
going
to
be,
in
fact,
less
fraud.
there's
going
to
be...
the
money
will
be
used
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
given
to
the
states,
and
there
will
be
a
deterrent
effect
in
terms
of
government
officials
not
actually
engaging
in
fraud
and...
and
a
related
interest
in
the
act
is,
in
fact,
promoting
representative,
responsive
democracy,
and
by
disclosing
frauds
to
the
public,
you
can
correct
them.
but
the
reality
still
is
the
contract,
the
lawsuit
is
only
brought
if,
in
fact,
there's
been
an
essential
misrepresentation,
something
really
basic
about
what
was
done
by
a
local
government
that
has
actually
misused
the
money.
local
government
has
gotten
the
money,
and,
in
fact,
all
the
local
government
is
giving
back
is,
it's
giving
back
the
money
it
wrongfully
got,
if
it's
shown
that
it
got
it
by...
got
it
falsely
or...
or
fraudulently.
it's
giving
back
prejudgment
interest
and,
within
the
statute
of
limitations
of
10
years,
that
is
always
virtually
going
to
exceed
the
basic
laws,
and
it's
going
to
have
to
pay
back
the...
give
a
share
to
the
relator,
which
is
an
important
piece
of
this,
because
congress
has
also
recognized
that,
in
this
area,
where
you
do
have
large
amounts
of
fraud
out
there,
there
are
no
private
victims.
there
is
nobody
who
steps
forward
and
says,
i
was
hurt,
and
therefore
i'm
going
to
bring
a
lawsuit
to
protect
myself
and
the
government
will
benefit,
and
the
government,
the
court...
the
congress
recognized,
doesn't
have
the
research...
the
resources
to
deal
with
all
this,
so
it
desperately
needs
the...
the
private
inspector
generals
who
are
willing
to
step
forward
oftentimes,
not
as
bounty
hunters,
but
as...
as
really
offended
citizens
who,
like
dr.
chandler,
who
brought
it
to
the
attention
of
the
county
and
said,
you're
not
doing
what
you're
supposed
to
do,
and
they
took
responsibilities
from
him
and
he
said
again,
and
you're
not
supposed
to...
you're
supposed
to
be
providing
these
services,
and
suddenly
she
wasn't
responsible
for
that.
they
need
these
people
to
come
in
and
blow
the
whistle,
because
otherwise,
the
government's
not
going
to
find
it,
and
they...
they
recognize
that
oftentimes
they're...
they're
terminated,
so
we've
got
to
pay
them
something
for
coming
forward,
so
what
the
government
is
really
paying
in
many
of
the
claims
is
not
much
more
than
what,
in
fact,
the
government...
what
the...
the
local
government
is
paying
is
not
much
more
than
what
the...
the
federal
government
paid
in
this
case--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
--that...
that's
a--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
--no,
i
don't...
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that,
and...
but
i...
to
be
honest,
i'm
a
little
offended,
but
the
treatment
their...
plaintiffs
in
here
are
no
different
than
plaintiffs
in
antitrust
cases,
or
securities
cases.
many
are
truly
wronged
and
are
outraged,
and
there
are
always
some
who
will
take
advantage
of
it,
but
the
reality
is
that--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
--oh,
i
don't--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
--we're
here
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
because
cook
county
wasn't
about
to
simply
say
this
is
play
money,
and
we're
going
to
pay
you.
that
isn't
really
what
happens
very
often.
if
they're
wrong,
they
agree
and
they...
they
pay,
but
they...
they
also
fight
you
tooth
and
nail,
and...
and
you
have
to
prove,
in
fact,
they
didn't
do
what
they
said
they
were
going
to...
what
they
committed
themselves
to
do,
but
the...
the
reality
is
that
there
are
no...
in
1863,
i
think
persons
clearly
included
municipal
corporations,
as
it
included
all
corporations.
there
is
nothing
in...
in
the
act
itself
that
in
any
way
suggests
that
congress
did
not
want
to
apply
it
to...
to
municipal--
mr.
judson
h.
miner
--it
wasn't,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that,
first
of
all,
again
going
back
to
lafayette,
this
court
recognized
the
fact
that
congress
in
1890
was
concerned
about
private
corporations
didn't
preclude
including
municipal
corporations
as
persons
under
the
sherman
act,
and...
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
local
governments
in
that
day
did
commercial
activities.
they
built
bridges,
they
took
care
of
the
indigent
at
the
request
of
states,
and
they
were
held
responsible
for
their
actions
and,
in
fact,
when
they
didn't
live
up
to
their
responsibilities,
they
were
routinely
sued,
and
they
could
well
have
been
reached
by
federal
government.
i
guess
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
