justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
lach,
on
that
point,
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that
the
sherman
act
does
apply
to
municipalities?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
isn't
it
true
that
in
the
original
sherman
act,
imprisonment
was
authorized
for
every
person
who
violates
the
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
interpretation
of
the
law
on
the
civil
side--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
not
nullified
because
there
was
a
provision
that
said,
every
person
is
subject
to
imprisonment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my...
my
simple
point
is
that
by
putting
a
clearly
penal
provision
in
the
statute,
that
did
not
make
municipalities
out
of
the
act,
and
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
arguing,
that
the
1863
act
is
penal
in
part--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
therefore,
it
could
not
have
in...
covered
municipalities.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
true
of
the
sherman
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
any
more
than
this
is
a
case
of
prosecution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
lach,
the
decision,
the
opinion
in
cowles
was
very
brief,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
was
sort
of
like,
well,
of
course.
if
this
was
establishing
something
that
hadn't
been
just
taken
for
granted,
don't
you
suppose
the
court
would
have
engaged
in
a
little
more
reasoning?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
lach,
didn't
the
court
also,
i
think
in
the
context
of
the
clayton
act,
characterize
treble
damages
as,
quote,
remedial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nonetheless,
it
used
the
word,
remedial
to
characterize
treble
damages,
and
one
of
the
difficulties
that
your...
your
argument
that
you're
now
making
encounters
is
that
this
change
in
1986,
wasn't
it
a
dramatic
expansion
of
qui
tam
liability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then...
then
you
think
that
at
the
same
time
that
congress
expanded
it,
it
also
cut
back,
without
any
indication
at
all?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm...
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
fully
grasp
the
point
you
were
just
making.
were
you
suggesting
that
congress
was
worried
about
fraud
against
municipalities,
but
it
didn't
think
that
fraud
would
be
engaged
in
by
municipal
units?
i
mean,
i
remember...
i'm
from
new
york,
and
i
remember
tammany
hall.
i
don't
think
it
was
altogether
so
different
in
cook
county,
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--were
there
any
grant
in
aid...
i
mean,
it
may
be
kind
of
an
academic
question
if,
in
1863,
the
federal
government
was
not
giving
out
money
to
municipalities.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
lach,
there's
one
point
that
you
didn't
cover
in
your
opening
argument--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
i'm
curious
how
you
read
this
statute.
with
regard
to
dr.
chandler,
she
claimed
that
when
she
blew
the
whistle,
there
was
retaliation
against
her.
there
is
a
retaliation
provision
in
the
false
claims
act.
on
your
reading
of
it,
would
she
have
recourse
to
that
provision
against
the
county?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
whatever,
the
municipal
employer,
would...
you
say
that
there
is
no
municipal
liability
for
the
allegedly
ill-gotten
gains,
but
what
about
retaliation
against
the
whistleblower?
would
the
act
apply
against
the
municipal
unit
to
that
extent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if...
if
the
employer...
employee
could
do
that,
the...
the
retaliation
provision
refers
to
retaliation
against
an
employee
for
conduct
in
furtherance
of
a
false
claims
act
action,
so
if
there
is
no
viable
false
claims
act
claim
against
a
municipality,
then
i
don't
see
how
the
retaliation
provision
could
be
available.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
talking
about
this
very
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
if
you're
right
that
there's
no
municipal
liability--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--especially
by
dr.
chandler,
do
i
understand
from
your
last
answer
that
you
are
saying,
no,
she's
out
of
luck,
the
statute
would
not
cover
her?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
what
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
was
that
a
private
corporation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
far
as
a
municipal
employer
is
concerned,
a
municipal
employer,
having
retaliated,
would
be,
on
your
reading
of
the
statute,
just
as
free
from
responsibility
as
it
would
be
for
the
underlying
qui
tam
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
i
was
asking
you
about.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
one
court
has
said.
how
does
that
court
say
that
the
employee's
action
was
in
furtherance
of
a
false
claims
act
action
if
there
is
no
false
claims
act
action?
