mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
false
claims
act
is
the
primary
mechanism
for
addressing
deliberate
efforts
to
cheat
the
federal
government
out
of
money
and
property.
petitioner
has
identified
no
legitimate
ground
for
excluding
local
governments
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
local
governments
receive
very
substantial
amounts
of
federal
money,
and
fraud
by
local
governments
causes
precisely
the
same
harms
as
comparable
misconduct
committed
by
a
private
party.
moreover,
local
governments
are
presumptively
encompassed
by
the
term,
person,
and
qui
tam
suits
against
local
governments
raise
no
constitutional
concerns.
now,
with
respect
to
the
1863
act,
to
begin,
it's
true
that
as
of
1863,
there
was
no
square
holding
of
this
court
to
the
effect
that
a
municipal
corporation
would
presumptively
be
treated
as
a
person
for
purposes
of
federal
statutes.
however,
given
the
materials
available
at
that
time,
congress
would
certainly
have
reasonably
concluded
that
municipalities
were
covered.
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
as
early
as
1826,
this
court
quoted
with
approval
lord
cook's
observation
to
the
effect
that
the
term,
person,
presumptively
includes
both
municipal
and
private
corporations
and,
again,
because
fraud
by
municipal
corporations
in
the
procurement
of
federal--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that...
that's
correct.
there
was
no
square
holding
to
that
effect,
but
certainly
all
the
indications
in
the
court's
opinions
would
have
supported
congress
in
its
view
that
the
term,
person,
would
include
local
governments.
the...
the
court
in
monell
held
that
as
of
1871
a
clear
understanding
to
that
effect
had
been
established,
and
petitioner
has
identified
no
evidence
that
would
suggest
that
the
prevailing
consensus
changed
during
the
years
between
1863
and
1871.
it...
it
may
also
be
the
case
that,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
the
question
would
have
been
a
largely
academic
one
in
1863,
because
local
governments
wouldn't
have
received
a
significant
amount
of
federal
money.
the
congress
deliberately
drafted
the
act
in
a
broad
fashion
so
that
it
would
encompass
spending
programs
that
were
adopted
in
the
future,
even
if
they
were
unknown
in
1863,
and...
and
the
court--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--oh,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
congress
contemplated
that.
i'm
saying
congress
wrote
the
statute
in
a
way
that
would
cover
whatever
spending
programs
came
to
be
adopted
in
ensuing
years,
and...
and
the
court
addressed
essentially
that
situation
in
u.s.
ex
rel.
marcus
versus
hess,
in
which
it
said
the
type
of
financial
assistance
that
we're
dealing
with
here
would
not
have
been
undertaken
in
1863,
yet
congress
drafted
the
act
broadly,
and
these
funds
are
in...
as
much
in
need
of
protection
as
other
federal
money,
and
congress
did,
in
some
significant,
some
relatively
minor
respects,
continue
to
amend
the
false
claims
act
at
intervals
during
the
period
between
1863
and
1986,
and
during
that
period,
it
became
increasingly
apparent
that
local
governments
were
beginning
to
receive
enhanced
shares
of
federal
money.
it
also
became
increasingly
apparent
that
the
term,
person
would
be
construed
generally
to
encompass
local
governments,
yet
congress
retained
the
word,
person,
even
as
it
amended
other
features
of
the
act,
and
i
think
petitioner's
primary
argument
is
that
even
if
the
statute
included
municipalities
up
to
1986,
the
1986
amendments
took
local
governments
out
of
the
act's
coverage
by
adding
a
punitive
component
to
the
damages
available,
and...
and
this
seems
implausible
for,
essentially
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
whole
thrust
of
the
1986
amendments
generally
was
to
make
the
act
more
effective,
to
expand
its
coverage,
to
give
the
government
greater
weapons
in
fighting
fraud,
so
it
seems
very
unlikely
that
at
the
same
time
congress
would
have
removed
from
the
act's
coverage--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
the
city
of
newport
involved
a
different
sort
of
statute.
that
is,
the
statute
at
issue
in
city
of
newport
was
42
u.s.c.
1983,
and
it
provided
an
express
cause
of
action,
but
it
said
nothing
about
the
remedies
that
would
be
available,
and
essentially
this
court's
holding
was,
where
the
statutory
directive
is
for
courts
to
use
their
own
best
judgment
as
to
what
remedies
are
appropriate,
punitive
damages
should
generally
not
be
imposed
upon
municipalities,
but
here,
congress
has
spoken
precisely
to
the
remedies
that
will
be
applied
at
the
end
of
a
successful
suit.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
statute
does
authorize
the
government
to
intervene
to
take
over
the...
the
prosecution
of
a
case
and
to
settle
or
dismiss
it,
and
at
least
on
occasion,
the
department
of
justice
has
intervened--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
i...
i
don't
want
to
represent
that
this
is
done
often,
but
it
is
an
available--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes.
the
figures
i've
been
given
by
the
civil
division
are
that
138
qui
tam
suits
have
been
filed
against
local
governments
since
1986.
in
13
of
those,
the
united
states
has
intervened.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
know
what
the
disposition
of
those...
sometimes
we
might
intervene
to
settle,
sometimes
we
might
intervene
because
we
believe
the
claim
is
meritorious
and
we
want
to...
to
prosecute
the
suit
to
its
conclusion.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
have
dollar
figures
with
respect
to
municipalities.
i
know
overall
since
1986
the
treasury
has
realized
a
little
over
$10
billion
in
recoveries
from
false
claims
act
suits.
that
includes
both
qui
tam
suits
and
suits
that
were
initiated
by
the
united
states.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
want
to
represent
we
will
do
this
on
a
regular
basis.
i
just
want
to
say,
it
is
an
available
mechanism
under
the
false
claims
act
in
extreme
situations,
where
public
policy
concerns
cause
the
department
of
justice
to
conclude
that
it's
not
in
the
public
interest
for
the
suit
to
go
forward.
the
other
point
i
would
make
with
respect
to
the
city
of
newport
is,
again,
if...
the
city
of
newport
dealt
with
a
statute
that
didn't
specifically
address
the
question
of
remedies
at
all.
now,
if
we're
correct
about
the
law
as
it
existed
before
1986,
that
local
governments
were
covered,
and
that
they
were
subject
to
the
double
damages
remedy
that
this
court
had
held
to
be
essentially
remedial,
if
congress
had
wanted
to
exclude
municipalities
from
the
act's
coverage,
it...
it
really
seems
outlandish
to
think
that
congress
would
have
attempted
to
achieve
that
objective
by
leaving
the
word,
person,
in
the
act
unchanged,
and
by
amending
the
act's
liability
provisions.
if
congress
had
believed
that
it
was
appropriate
either
to
take
the
municipalities
out
of
the
scope
of
the
act
altogether,
or
at
least
to
subject
them
to
remedies
less
than
those
available
against
private
corporations,
the
natural
thing
to
do
would
have
been
to
amend
the
act
so
to
provide.
it...
it
seems
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
attempted
to
achieve
that
objective
by
so
indirect
a
means.
the
other
point
we
would
make
is
that
there
may
be
isolated
situations
in
which
an
award
of
treble
damages
under
the
act
will
far
exceed
the
harm
that
was
done
to
the
united
states,
but
the
alternative
that
petitioner
contends
we
believe
is
much
worse,
because
it
would
leave
the
act
entirely
unavailable
for
redressing
all
manner
of
fraud
committed
by
local
governments
against
the
united
states.
when
we
have
a
contract
action,
when
we
have
an
ordinary
suit
of
a
dispute
about
money,
and
we
regard
it
as
a
good
faith
controversy,
even
if
we
prevail
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it's
often
the
case
that
the
united
states
won't
be
made
completely
whole,
because
we
incur
costs
of
investigation,
costs
of
prosecuting
the
suit,
we
may
lose
the
time
value
of
money.
when
we're
dealing
with
good
faith
disputes,
congress
and
the
executive
branch
have
been
content
to
treat
that
undercompensation
simply
as
a
cost
of
doing
business.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i...
i
don't
know
that
any
do.
it
certainly
would
not
be
the
norm.
i
mean,
the...
the
american
rule
is
that
each
party
bears
its...
its
own
attorney's
fees,
and
so
absent
some
express
statutory
authority,
we
would
not
be
able
to
recover
our
fees,
even
if
we
prevailed,
and
so
again,
congress
is
willing--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
think
with...
certainly
as
to
municipalities
i
think
we
would
have
a
hard
time,
without
express
statutory
authority,
arriving
at
a
contractual
agreement
that
municipalities
would
be
subject
to
such
an
unusual
remedy
and,
as
i
say,
congress
and
the
executive
branch
are
willing
to
live
with
that
form
of
undercompensation
when
we're
dealing
with
a
good
faith
dispute.
the
false
claims
act
is
reserved
for
that
narrow
category
of
cases
that
involve
people
who
don't
simply
ask
for
money
that,
in
fact,
they're
not
entitled
to,
but
who
ask
for
it
knowing
they're
not
entitled
to
it,
and
congress
reasonably
concluded
that
different
remedies
were
necessary
to
address
efforts
to
defraud
and
cheat
the
federal
government.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there...
a
false
statement
is
one
category.
there...
there
is
a
knowing
requirement.
that
is,
the
individual
entity
has
to
knowingly
submit
a
false
claim.
there...
there
are
instances
in
which
the
claim
may
be
false
even
if
it
doesn't
contain
an
express
false
statement.
for
instance,
if
it's
very
clear
that
it's
necessary,
for
instance,
that
medical
services
be
medically
necessary
in
order
to
be
reimbursable,
and
the--
