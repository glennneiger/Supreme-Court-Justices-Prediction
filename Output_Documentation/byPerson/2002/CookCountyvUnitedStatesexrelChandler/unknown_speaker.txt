unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
lach,
you
don't
dispute
that
the
word
persons
extends
to
some
corporations
under
the
act,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there...
there
are
also
cases
from
about
that
time
that
say
that
a...
a
municipality
is
included
in
the...
in
the
term,
corporation,
at
any
rate.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
louisville
and
letson?
unknown
speaker
oh,
we...
we
thought
otherwise
in...
in
monell,
certainly.
we
said
in
monell,
and
i'm
quoting
it,
the
letson
principle
in
1869
was
automatically
and
without
discussion
extended
to
municipal
corporations.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
there
was
a...
a
major
change
between,
when,
1863
and
1869?
unknown
speaker
in
that
6-year
period,
there
was
suddenly,
whap,
it
applied
to
municipal
corporations,
before
that
it
didn't?
it
seems
to
me
most
implausible.
unknown
speaker
in
6
years?
unknown
speaker
ms.
lach--
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
you
would
have
a
better
argument
if
you
simply
said,
the
1983
change
does
not
impose
punitive
damages
on
local
corporations,
than
to
say
it
suddenly
proscribes
an
entire
escape
hatch
from
any
sort
of
liability
at
all.
unknown
speaker
but
it
didn't
make
it
clear
at
that
time
that
the
change
made
them
punitive.
it
was
only
in
the
stevens
opinion
that
we
decided
they
were
punitive.
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
whether
you
think
that
cook
county
could
bring
a
qui
tam
action?
unknown
speaker
and
there's
no...
there's
no
need
to
decide
it
here.
i...
i
was
just
curious
if
you
did
have
a
position
on
it.
unknown
speaker
before
that,
they
looked
at
the
citizenship
of
the
individual
shareholders
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
was
diversity
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
fact
that
local
governments
were
sued
in
these
cases
under
some
sort
of
common
law
theory,
i
take
it,
does
not
necessarily
answer
the
question
of
whether
statutory
language
using
the
word,
person
includes
them.
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
don't
paint
too
rosy
a
picture.
i
mean,
if
qui
tam
actions
were
as
desirable
as
you
assert,
they
would
not
have
been
eliminated
in
england
totally,
and
vastly
reduced
in
the
united
states,
because
they
are
an
invitation
to
shakedowns.
that's...
that's
why
they've
been
largely
eliminated
from
our
law.
unknown
speaker
so
you
know,
if...
if
loving
qui
tam
actions
is...
is
what
you
need
to
win
your
case,
you're...
you're--
unknown
speaker
--most
cases
don't
have
a
treble
damage
situation,
and
most...
most
cases
don't
deal
with...
well,
as
this
one
does,
with
municipalities,
where
it's
really...
you
know,
it's
play
money,
right?
it's
not
really
money
out
of
your
pocket.
unknown
speaker
so
better
to
pay
this
fellow
off
and
get
on
with
the
business
of
the
city,
and...
i
mean,
those
are
problems
with...
with
a
qui
tam
action.
let's
not...
let's
not
minimize--
unknown
speaker
there...
that...
that
case,
though,
was
dealing
with
a
private
corporation,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
now,
aren't
you
gilding
the
lily
a
little
bit
to
say
that
congress
in
1863
contemplated
that
there
would
be
massive
federal
spending
programs
in
the
future?
unknown
speaker
and
settled,
or--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
have
some
dollar
figures
in
those?
unknown
speaker
do
any
government
grants
or
contracts
have
attorney's
fees
provisions
in
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
a
problem,
you
can
put
it
in
your
grant.
unknown
speaker
is
a
false
statement
a
necessary
prerequisite
to
an
action
under
these
qui
tam?
