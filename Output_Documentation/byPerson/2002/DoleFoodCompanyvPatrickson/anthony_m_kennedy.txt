why
do
you
limit
to
the
majority?
supposing
they
have
practical
control
as
in
other
situations,
you
look
at
who
really
runs
the
company.
justice
anthony
m.

but
it
doesn't
say
majority
ownership
of
grandchildren
of
the
parent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
suppose
it
could
mean
ownership
of
other
forms,
for
instance,
an
oil-drilling
venture,
a
working
interest
of
70
percent,
which
is
not
usually
called
a
share.
it's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so...
so
there...
there's
work
for
that
phrase
in
the
statute
to
do
without
adopting
your
position,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
have
one...
one
small
procedural
question.
why
is
dole
properly
before
us?
i
want
to
make
you
feel
welcome
here,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you...
you
impleaded...
you
impleaded
the
dead
sea
companies,
and
they're
the
ones--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--oh,
you
represent
dead
sea?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why...
why
is
dole
properly
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
and...
and
dole
was
dismissed
on
that...
on
that
ground,
and
that
hasn't
been
appealed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that...
that
hasn't
been
brought--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
requires
us
to
interpret
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
and
under
that
act
foreign
states
can
claim
certain
immunities
and
rights
when
they
are
sued
in
the
state
or
a
federal
court.
a
corporation
that
is
an
instrumentality
of
a
foreign
state
can
also
claim
some
of
those
same
rights,
and
the
right
that
is
in
question
here
is
the
right
to
remove
a
suit
that
is
filed
in
state
court
to
a
federal
court.
these
are
two
cases
and
in
01-594,
the
petitioners
are
two
foreign
corporations
organized
under
the
lawsuit
of
state
of
israel.
they
were
sued
in
state
court
of
hawaii
and
they
invoked
the
act
in
order
to
removed
the
federal
district
court.
and
there
are
two
questions:
the
first
is,
does
israel's
relationship
to
these
companies
make
them
instrumentalities
of
a
foreign
state
so
that
they
can
come
within
in
this
act?
the
statute
says
a
corporation
is
an
instrumentality
of
a
majority
of
its
shares
or
other
ownership
interests
as
owned
by
the
foreign
state.
the
problem
for
these
petitioners
is
that
israel
did
not
own
their
shares
directly.
instead,
israel,
at
the
relevant
time,
owned
the
majority
of
shares
in
the
corporation
that
was
removed
from
these
corporations
by
several
tiers
of
ownerships.
they
were
subsidiaries
several
years
then.
so
they
were
subsidiaries
of
a
corporation
that
was
owned
by
israel
and
we
hold
that
this
indirect
ownership
does
not
suffice
to
bring
the
companies
under
the
act,
and
the
petitioners
say,
well,
since
you
can
trace
down
the
corporate
latter,
and
show
that
each
parent
own
the
majority
of
the
subsidiary
immediately
beneath
then
in
effect
and
certainly
in
common
parlance
these
companies
were
owned
by
israel.
in
matters
of
corporate
law,
the
structure
is
of
great
importance,
and
as
a
general
rule,
a
corporate
parent
that
owns
shares
of
this
subsidiary
does
not
own
the
subsidiaries
assets,
and
if
those
assets
happen
to
be
shares
in
some
other
corporation,
the
parent
does
not
own
them
either.
the
same
rule
applies.
these
petitioners
could
not
claim
to
be
instrumentalities
of
israel
for
a
second
alternative
reason.
that
is
because
even
if
they
are
indirect
ownership
theory
had
been
correct,
israel
had
divested
itself
of
its
ownership
in
the
corporate
parent
by
the
time
the
suit
was
filed,
and
we
hold
that
at
the
time
of
filing
suite,
not
the
time
of
the
alleged
wrong
that
is
controlling.
this
is
the
same
rule
we
follow
in
other
cases
where
jurisdiction
is
being
tested,
for
instance,
in
the
diversity
cases
as
the
time
of
suit
has
filed
that
is
controlling.
so
it
follows
that
under
the
relevant
provision
of
the
act
which
is
28
u.s.c.
sections
1603(b),
the
petiioners
cannot
claim
instrumentalities
status
under
the
act
and
they
cannot
invoke
its
protections
and
they
cannot
invoke
the
right
to
remove.
in
no.
01-594,
then
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed.
the
portion
of
the
opinion
for
the
court
referring
to
the
time
for
assertaining
ownerships
status
is
unanimous.
as
to
the
portion
of
the
opinion
discussing
direct
ownership,
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justice
o'conner.
in
no.
01-593,
the
petitioners
relied
on
a
different
theory
for
removal.
that
theory
involves
an
issue
which
is
not
the
subject
of
our
writ
of
certiorari,
so
that
case
is
dismissed
by
order
of
the
unanimous
court.
