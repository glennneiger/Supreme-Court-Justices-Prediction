justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
01-593,
the
dole
food
company
versus
patrickson,
and
a
companion
case.
mr.
paden.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
we
do
with
diversity
jurisdiction?
supposing
a
person...
supposing
diversity
jurisdiction
exists
at
the
time
the
suit
is
filed,
but
by
the
time
it
gets
up
on
appeal,
it
does
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
i...
i
would
like
to
know
just
for
purposes
of
analogy,
the...
when
something
exists
at
the
time
the
suit
is
filed,
but
is
lost
during
its
process.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
paden.
mr.
massey,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
is
the
phrase
that
you
say
is
familiar
from
corporate
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
a
phrase,
or
a
concept?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
not
saying
that
the
phrase,
shares
or
other
ownership
interest,
is
a
familiar
phrase--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why...
why
would
it
eliminate
the
right
to
jury
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--or
it
might
also
extend
over
a
considerable
period
of
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
was
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
passed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
presumably
lived,
then,
for
200
years
without
it,
these
cases
being
tried
in
state
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
massey.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
paden,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we...
we
have
always
construed
jurisdictional
statutes
quite
narrowly,
going
all
the
way
back
to
strawbridge
against
curtis,
that
said
you
have
to
have
complete
diversity
under
the
diversity
statute,
and
it
seems
to
me
you're
asking
for
something
different
than
that
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
paden.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-593,
dole
food
company
against
patrickson
and
the
companion
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
