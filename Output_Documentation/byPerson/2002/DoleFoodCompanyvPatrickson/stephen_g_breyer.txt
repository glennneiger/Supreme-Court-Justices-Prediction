justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
why
would
we
do
that?
if
we...
if
we
took
your
view,
there
are
quite
a
few
jurisdictional
statutes,
i
guess,
which
talk
about
action
against
a
foreign
state.
wouldn't
we
then
have
to
read
all
those
to
say
they
mean
actions
against
a
former
foreign
state,
so
if
you
sued
illyria
or
bohemia,
you
would
suddenly
discover
you
could
get
into
federal
court,
while
if
you
don't
take
your...
your
approach,
you'd
say
the...
the
question
of...
that
you're
worried
about
will
arise
when
they
get
to
the
substance
of
the
issue
in
the
state
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's...
what's
the
sensitivity
if
somebody
decides
to
sue
czarist
russia?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
if
the
state
gives
up
the
corporation,
and
no
longer
is
part
of
it,
i
would
have
thought
that
that's
just
one
of
the
risks
that
they'd
have
to
run.
why...
why...
i
mean,
they...
if
they
want...
if
they're
worried
about
it,
keep
control
of
the
corporation.
if
you're
not
that
worried
about
it,
then
when
you
release
the
corporation,
you're
subject
to
a
lot
of
state
court
lawsuits.
is
that...
why
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
can't
get
much
of
a
feeling
one
way
or
the
other
about
that,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
i...
i
don't...
can
you
say
something
that
will
make
it
quite
clear
that
would
be
a
terrible
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
a
lot
of
those
tort
claims
are
going
to
be
for
continuing
actions,
so
in
your
view,
if
the
chemical
is
disseminated
partly
while
the
state
is
the
owner
of
the
company
and
partly
while
it
isn't,
then
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
is
there
diverse...
there's
no
diversity
because
there
isn't
complete
diversity?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because?
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--nobody
doubts
that
there
are
other
ways
of
owning
corporations.
they're
just
saying,
one
other
way
of
owning
it
is
like,
under
the
public
utility
holding
company
act,
you
have
a...
a
pyramid
of
shares
with
intervening
corporations.
they're
not
saying
that's
the
only
other
way.
they're
saying
that's
one
other
way,
and
then
you
say,
no,
that
one
other
way
is
not
another
way,
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no...
nobody's
saying
stock
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they're
saying
is,
stock
in
intervening
corporations
organized
in
certain
ways--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
under
the
public
utility
holding
company
act,
is
one
other
way,
and
i
still
haven't
heard
the
word...
you
see,
that's
why
i
keep
asking,
because.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
to
me
it's
an
unusual
way,
not
that
unusual.
the...
the
law
books
are
filled
with
cases
involving
that,
under
the
act
i
cited,
and...
and
so
they
say,
that's
one
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
i
want
to
know
why
that
isn't
one
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
other
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
don't
quite
see
that,
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know
that's
your...
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now...
but
let
me
push
the
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--one
step
further.
suppose
i
thought
that
the
word,
other
ownership
interest,
is
at
least
open
to
this
unusual
type
of
arrangement
as
one
form
of
ownership
interest.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
still
you
should
say,
you
shouldn't
interpret
it
that
way,
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
now
if
i
think
it
is
not
a
stretch,
but
just
another
form
of
ownership--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
putting
this
hypothetically--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
then
go
on
to
think,
you
know,
i
cannot
think
of
a
reason
in
the
world,
not
even
one,
not
even
a
shadow
of
one,
as
to
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
say,
when
country
x
owns
business
a,
it
gets
into
federal
court,
but
when
everything
is
the
same,
but
for
a
stack
of
papers
this
thick
which
puts
a
bunch
of
intervening
paper
corporations
between
a
and
z,
it
doesn't
want
it
to
get
into
federal
court,
i
think
what
could
they...
what
human
being
could
possibly
think
of
any
conceivable
reason
for
drawing
that
difference,
and
at
that
point...
i'm
putting
it
as
strongly
as
i
can...
i
come
up
with
a
blank.
i
can't
think
of
one.
i
used
to
have
relatives
who
had
little
tiny
corporations,
and
the
number
in
between
was
a
matter
of
tax
law
or
something.
it
was
the
same
person
sitting
at
the
same
desk--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--doing
the
same
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
put
it
as
strongly
as
i
can.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
it
does
have
a
few...
but
nonetheless
my
question
is,
what
conceivable
reason
could
there
be
for
saying
those
special
advantages
disappear
when
there
is
country
a,
and
when
there
is
country
a
to
z,
since
the
only
difference
between
a
and
a
to
z,
i'd
repeat,
is
a
bunch
of
paper?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
their
point,
though,
is
that,
first
my
examples
were
slightly
absurd,
and...
which
they
were...
and
secondly,
that
in
any
real
case
where...
where
you
have,
say,
communist
russia
you're
suing,
or...
or
more
recent
former
states,
you're...
you're
actually
suing
the
state,
and
the...
the
defense
is,
but
that
state
no
longer
exists,
like
bosnia
or
something.
there
are
a
few
things
that
are
more
involved
in
foreign
relationships,
and...
and
boy,
to
suddenly
throw
that
to
50
state
courts
is
a
total
nightmare
if
you're
really
worried
about
the
foreign
state,
so
even
though
it
creates
differences
between
the
diversity
jurisdiction
and
the
other,
we
better
keep
these
in
federal
court,
or
we're
all
in
trouble.
i
mean,
that's
what
i
took
them
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
works
all
right
with
the
corporations,
but
what
if
you're
actually
suing
the
state,
which
still
has
some
assets
somewhere?
how
does
that
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
but
if
we
go
into
the
foreign
state,
former
foreign
states
don't
count,
we've
decided
that,
and
so
i...
just
curious.
i
don't
want
to
do
it
blindly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
reading
that...
that
throws
out
the
corporation
that
used
to
be
owned
but
now
isn't
by
a
foreign
state,
but
keeps
the
former
foreign
state
within?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
don't
think
of
these
things
all
the
time,
so...
so
what...
what
about...
they
just
don't.
it's...
and
that's...
we
have...
that's
why
we
have
a
difficult
problem,
so
i
wondered,
with
the
language,
and
nobody
accepts...
i
just
want
to
know
the
reason
for
this,
and
i'm
sure
it's
not
a
tenable
interpretation,
because
nobody's
advanced
it,
but
if
you
look
at
the
first
part,
literally
speaking,
it
says
a
foreign
state
includes
an
instrumentality
of
a
foreign
state,
and
so
an
instrumentality
of
a
foreign
state,
is,
among
other
things,
a
corporation,
the
majority
of
shares
of
which
the
foreign
state
owns.
and
that's
true
as
to
the
first
corporation
in
the
tier,
a.
well,
now,
since
a
is
included
in
the
term,
foreign
state,
it
therefore
is
a
foreign
state.
that's
what
it
says.
and
therefore,
b
is
a
company
whose
shares,
the
majority
of
which
are
owned
by
a
foreign
state,
and
so
forth
down
the
line.
now,
literally,
that's
what
it
says,
and
so
what's
wrong
if
i
can't
think
of
any
reason
why
they'd
want
a
difference,
and
the...
that
language
literally
covers
it,
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or...
but
you're
referring
there
back
to
the
intent
of
congress.
i
see
that
linguistic
point,
but
if
we're
referring
back
to
the
intent
of
congress,
i'm
back
to
my
question
i
asked
before,
what
possible
intent
of
congress
could
the
interpretation
that
you
advance
further?
i
mean,
what
reason
is
there?
the
same
questions
i
asked
before.
i'm
just--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you've
got
me
back
to
that
because
of
your
response,
which
referred
to
the
intent
of
congress.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
deal
with
somebody
who
sues
yugoslavia,
as
a
state?
i
mean,
they
find
some
assets
owned
by
yugoslavia,
they
go
sue
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
that
goes
to
a...
west
virginia
state
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
suing
yugoslavia.
that's
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the...
it
says,
defendant,
yugoslavia.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
somebody
over
there
who
claims
to
be
the
recipient
of
lawsuits...
i
mean,
we
could
easily
construct
a
serious
problem,
or
you
may
have
looked
into
it
in
telling
me
it
just
isn't
a
problem,
and
i'd
like
to
hear
you
say
that,
if
that's
so,
because
it
would
help.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
you're
telling
me,
and
you've
looked
into
it,
this
isn't
really
a
problem,
it's
theoretical,
not
real?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
listed
two.
they
said,
first
of
all
it's
easier
for
the
court
not
to
have
to
go
through
the
morass
of
paper
and
try
to
figure
out
who
owns
what
where,
and
the
second
one
is
that,
because
it's
less
surprising,
at
least
the
customers
and
others
will
know,
likely,
who
owns
the
company,
and
know
it's
the
state.
those
were
their
two
responses.
