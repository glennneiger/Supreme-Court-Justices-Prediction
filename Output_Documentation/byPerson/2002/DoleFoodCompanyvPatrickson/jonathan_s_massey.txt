mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
first
question
presented.
owning
shares
of
stock
in
a
parent
corporation
in
our
view
should
not
be
equated
with
owning
shares
in
the
subsidiary.
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
text
of
the
act,
and
the
structure,
and
its
purposes,
beginning
with
the
distinctive
text
of
1603(b)(2),
which,
as
justice
ginsburg
noted,
does
not
refer
to
ownership
in
the
abstract,
it
refers
to
a
special
legal
kind
of
ownership.
it
says,
a
majority
of
shares
or
other
ownership
interests
and,
in
using
that
familiar
phraseology
of
corporate
law,
it's
borrowing
something
which
is
related
to
the
meyer
opinion,
i
think,
that
justice
breyer
delivered
this
morning,
the
notion
that
there's
a
degree
of
separateness
between
a
corporation
and
a
shareholder.
that
case,
as
we
heard
it,
turned
on
the
liabilities
that
the
shareholder
would
not
bare--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
the
concept
of
a
majority
of
shares.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
the
phrase
in
particular,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
the...
as...
i'm
sorry,
the
concept.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
phrase...
no,
your
honor,
i'm
saying
it's
a
concept,
the
concept
of
what
it
means
to
own
a
majority
of
shares
in
a
corporation
and,
in
particular,
1603(b)(2)
is
written
from
the
perspective
of
the
subsidiary.
it's
written
from
a
bottom-up
perspective,
rather
than
a
top-down
perspective,
and
it
asks,
from
the
subsidiary's
perspective,
who
owns
the
majority
of
its
shares
and
it
is,
in
our
view,
the
corporate
entity
which
sits
directly
atop
the
subsidiary,
rather
than
the
foreign
state,
which
may
stand
several
tiers
removed.
it's
sort
of
telling
that
in
the
dead
sea
company's
own
corporate
disclosure
statement,
they
list
as
their...
as
the
owner
of
dead
sea...
israel
chemicals
limited,
which
is
the
company
which
sits
directly
above
dead
sea
bromine.
the
corporate
disclosure
statement
then
goes
on
to
say
that
israel
chemicals
limited
is,
in
turn,
held
by
another
company,
which
is
the
israel
corporation,
and
it
doesn't
explain
that
the
israel...
it
doesn't
state
that
the
israel
corporation
is
the
owner
of
dead
sea
bromine.
that's
just
the
natural
way
we
talk
about
it
in
the...
in
the...
especially
in
the
corporate
law
realm,
which
congress
was
adopting
in
16(b)...
1603(b)(2).
there
are
several
textual
clues
in
section
1603
that
congress
was
adopting
the
principle
of
corporate
separateness.
1603(b)(1)
requires
that
a
corporation
be...
a...
a
showing
that
the
agency
be
a
separate
legal
person.
1610(b),
which
governs
attachments,
limits
attachments
of
property
to
claims
against
the
particular
agency
or
instrumentality
against
whom
the
claim
is
raised,
and
this
court,
in
the
first
national
citibank
case,
held
that
the...
under
the
fsia,
the...
the
property
and
assets
of
a
foreign-owned
corporation
are
distinct
from
the
property
and
assets
of
the
foreign
state
itself,
so
this
is
not
even
a
case
like
bestfoods,
where
this
court
said
that
congress'
silence
was
audible
in...
in
that
congress
was
legislating
against
these
background
corporate
law
principles.
here,
there
are
quite
clear
textual
signs
that
congress
was
adopting
a
principle
of
corporate
law.
now,
the
primary
argument
on
the
other
side,
this
that
is
a...
the
indirect
shareholding
is
a
form
of
other
ownership
interest,
and
i...
we
think
that
is
not
a
proper
reading
of
this
statute.
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
there
are
other
forms
of
ownership
interests
in
the
world.
there
are
shares
in
an
oil
venture.
the
tennessee
valley
authority,
for
example,
doesn't
have
stock.
the
federal
government
simply
owns
it.
the
stock
has
been
retired.
congress
was
dealing
here
with
foreign
legal
systems
which
may
have
different
ways
of
framing
equity
interests.
socialist
countries,
for
example,
you
can
imagine
there
might
not
be
shares,
so
in
our
view
the
phrase,
other
ownership
interests,
is
meant
to
take
into
account
those
sorts
of
equity
holdings,
so
in
this
case--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
because
congress
was
dealing
with
other
foreign
owners,
other--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
because
there...
we
believe
it's...
there
are
two
reasons,
primarily.
first,
is...
the
first
part
of
the
phrase,
shares,
already
takes
care
of
stock.
it
would
be
unreasonable,
in
our
view,
to
say
indirect
stock
counts
as
other--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--because
stock
is
not
an
other
kind
of
interest.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
because
it's
already
been
listed--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--sure.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
that--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--because
it--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--right.
first,
because
it's
still
stock.
even
if
it's
indirectly
held,
it's
still
stock.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--okay,
and
then
second
is,
you're
absolutely
right,
the
law
books
are
filled,
the
u.s.
code
is
filled
with
many
other
phrasings
of
direct,
indirect
references
to
affiliates,
references
to
beneficial
ownership,
all
the
kinds
of
things,
a
control
test,
as
justice
stevens
mentioned,
all
the
kinds
of
things
that
could
capture
this
kind
of
interest,
but
instead
we
have
the
very
distinctive
phrasing
that
says,
stock,
and
in
our
view,
once
you
count
stock
first
as
a
direct
majority
ownership,
you
shouldn't
go
back
and
count
it
again
as
an
indirect
form.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
the
other
ought
to
be
reserved--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--i
know.
i
know.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
because
the
number
of
principles
that
animate
the
statute,
first,
this
is
a
jurisdictional
statute.
jurisdictional
statutes
should
be
construed
precisely
with
clear,
bright
line
rules
and,
in
our
view,
the...
the
kind
of
direct
legal
ownership
of
stock
is
a
kind
of
bright
line
rule
and
the
court
should
not
depart
from
it.
second,
the
statute
already
contains,
in
the
first
clause
of
1603(b)(3),
the...
the
so-called
oregon
test.
the
oregon
test
captures
governmental
entities
which
perform
sovereign
functions
which
are
staffed
by
government
employees
over
which
the
government
has
a
significant
degree
of
control.
that's
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
that
was
decided
both
by...
in
both
courts
below
adverse
to
the
petitioners,
and
it's
not
before
this
court,
but
that
clause
would
capture
all
of
the
stereotypical
cases
at
the
heart
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
so
we
ought
not
stretch
this
part
of
the
statute
to
cover
it.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
right,
and
of
course
congress
is...
congress
has
to
legislate
by
category.
it's
not
simply
dealing
with
the
example
of
100
percent
subsidiaries.
congress
is
drawing
a
general
rule
and,
as
a
general
rule,
the...
the
line
it
drew
was
reasonable
because
congress
was
interested
in
facilitating
suits
against
foreign
states
in
the
united
states
courts.
that's
one
of
the
purposes
that's
laid
out
in
1602
in
the
statute,
and
reading
the
statute
the
petitioners'
way
would
disserve
those
purposes.
first,
it
would
impose
important
procedural
burdens
on
litigants
that
congress
did
not
want
to
impose.
it
would
eliminate
traditional
state
long
arm
statutes.
it
would
eliminate
the
right
to
jury
trial.
it
would
create
immunity
questions,
because
once
immunity
is
invoked--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
under
the
fsia,
once
a...
a...
an
entity
is
deemed
to
be
a
foreign
state,
the
right
to
jury
trial
is
lost,
even
if
an
exception
to
immunity
is
subsequently
found
to
apply.
it
would...
the...
the
other
burdens
it
imposes,
it
eliminates
the
traditional
attachment
provision
that's--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
again,
as
i
said,
congress
is
not
just
legislating
with
that
specific
example
of
100
percent
subsidiaries,
it's
using
a...
the
general
category.
it...
it
has
to
operate
by
general
rule.
i
think
other
examples,
though,
would
show
that
when
you
have
multiple
tiers,
there...
the
surprise
factor
significantly
increases.
congress
was
concerned
that
litigants
would
be
surprised
to
discover
that
they
were
not
dealing
with
an
ordinary
commercial
entity
but,
rather,
a
foreign
state,
and
that
surprise
factor
increases
as
you
go
down
the
corporate
tier
to
the
nth
tier.
also,
there
are
potentially
complex
factual
inquiries
as
you
go
down
the...
a...
a
tier.
in
this
case,
there
are
organization
charts
which
show
how
the
shareholdings
have
been
computed,
but
consider,
when
ownership
is
not
expressed
through
shares
but
through
some
percentage
of
assets
or
partnership
interests
which
are
not
going
to
be
reflected
in
a
shareholder
ledger,
but
are
going
to
be
the
potential
subject
of
controversy
in
a
court,
and
i
think
the
potential
for
factual
disputes
increases.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
of
course.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
that...
that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
our
view,
congress
didn't
have
to
use
directly,
because
it
was
using
this
familiar
corporate
concept
of
a
majority
ownership
of
shares.
that
implies
direct,
because
the
owner
of
a
majority
of
shares
in...
in
this
tiering
relationship
is
the
corporation
immediately
above
the
subsidiary,
it's
not--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--where
this
court
has
held
it?
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
i'm...
i'm
not
aware
of
any...
of
any
case,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
do
that
right
now,
because
i
think
the
timing
question
is...
is
a
independent
way
of
resolving
this
case.
ever
since
1824,
when
chief
justice
marshall
announced
mollan
against
torrance,
the
rule
has
been
that
jurisdiction
is
determined
as
of
the
date
of
filing
the
complaint.
the
chief
justice
asked,
what
is
the
rule
in
diversity
cases?
well,
since
anderson
and
watt
in
1891,
diversity
cases
have
been
held
to
be...
to
be
governed
by
that
rule,
and
the
response
we
hear
is
that
this
is
a
federal
question
case,
but,
of
course,
even
federal
question
cases
are
governed
by
the
familiar
rule
that
the
date
is
given
by
the...
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
that's...
united
states
against
keene
corporation
in
1993
reflected
that
principle.
and
as
justice
ginsburg
noted,
even
if
some
parts
of
the
act
are
a
federal
question,
it's
also
telling
that
in
1332(a)(4),
congress
created
a
new
species
of
diversity
jurisdiction,
so
accepting
the
petitioners'
argument
here
would
lead
to
the
anomalous
situation
where
there's
a
diversity
part
of
the
statute
that's
going
to
be
governed
by
the
mollan
against
torrance
rule,
and
there
will
be
a
federal
question
part
of
the
statute
that
would
be
governed
by
a
different
rule.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
okay...
well,
i
misunderstood.
i
apologize,
but
then
that
also
means
that
there
are
some
diversity
rules
that
are
being
interpreted
one
way,
and
other
diversity
rules
being
interpreted
a
different
way.
either
way,
there's
an
anomaly,
and
it
appears
to
us
the
simplest
way
to
resolve
it
would
simply
be
to
adhere
to
the
longstanding
principle
that
the
date
on
which
the
complaint
is
filed
is
the
relevant
time
to
take
a
snapshot.
that's
also
more
administratively
feasible,
because
you
can
imagine
that
the
rule
of
when
the
underlying
conduct
occurred
is
a...
is
a...
might
be
difficult
to
determine
in
some
cases.
in
this--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
agree
completely.
and
so
it's...
it's
more
reasonable
to
assume
congress
was
legislating
against
the
background
understanding
that
the
date
of
filing
of
the
complaint
would
be
determinative.
it
used
the
present
tense
in
1603.
in
1441(d),
which
is
the
removal
provision
at
issue
here,
it
talked
about
a
case
against
a
foreign
state,
and
in
our
view,
it's
more
reasonable,
it's
more
naturally
read
to
think
that
a
case
is
a
case
against
a
foreign
state
only
if
the
entity
actually
is
a
foreign
state
at
the
time,
as
opposed
to
being
czarist
russia.
1608,
which
is
the
special
service
provision,
also
indicates
that
congress
is
contemplating
entities
that
actually
were
foreign
states,
because--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--right.
well,
i
think
the...
the
answer
to
the
jurisdiction
point
and
the
sort
of
state
court
point
is
that
they're
already
is
a
provision
in
the
diversity
statute,
1332(a)(3),
i
believe
it
is,
that
deals
with
citizens
of
foreign
countries,
so
there's
already
diversity
jurisdiction
for
suits
against
foreign
corporations
after
they've
been
privatized.
they
would
be
able...
any
claim
against
the
government
would
be
protected
by
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
as
justice
scalia
noted.
there
could
be
no...
of
course,
no
direct
liability
imposed--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
that,
of
course,
isn't...
that's
not
going
to
be
before
this
court
today,
but--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
no,
i'm...
we're
not
asking
you
to
decide
anything
about...
about
former
foreign
states.
i
think--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
the...
the
whole
immunity
that
foreign
states
enjoy
is
governed
by
1604
and
1605,
and...
and
the
provision
that
we're
focusing
here
is...
is
just
the
definition
of
agency
and
instrumentality,
so
i...
i
think
this
court
could
safely
leave
for
another
day
the
issue
of
the
former
foreign
state.
it...
it's
not
at
the...
it's
not
in
the
provision
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
interpret,
and...
and
it's
governed
by
different
provisions
which
your
honors
could...
could
leave
for
another
day.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
it's...
undoubtedly
the
forum
nonconvenience
defense
would
be
raised
in
state
court
as
well.
in
this
case,
the...
no
proceedings
of
any
substance
have
occurred,
so
nobody--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
that
is
the...
yes,
that's
the
general
pattern.
it's...
that's
correct
and,
of
course,
i
think
there
would
also
be
an
immunity
asserted.
the
dead
sea
petitioners
have
preserved
that.
it's
in
joint
appendix
57,
and...
and
the...
the
issue
of
whether
they
would
be
entitled
to
immunity,
or
whether
the
commercial
activity
exception
would
apply
or
something,
hasn't
been
litigated
yet.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
1976,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the...
the...
under
the...
the
prevailing
doctrine
of
the
separate
entity
rule,
any
separate
unit
or
corporation
was
not
entitled
to
immunity,
that's
correct,
and
it
was
governed
by,
after
1952
the
tate
letter,
which
the...
which
the
state
department
issue
didn't...
this
court
has
described
the
procedural
history
in
verlinden,
but
you're
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
that
in
the...
at
the
end
of
the
day,
what...
what
is
at
issue
here
is
