o'connor
is
it...
is
it
owned
in
the
same
capacity
now
as
it
was
earlier?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
it
owned
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
right,
and
so
are
you
going
to
address,
then,
how
it
comes
under
the
statute
at
all
in
those
circumstances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel
for...
i'm
just
not
sure
we
ever
get
to
this
question.
this
statute,
the
foreign
sovereign
immunity
statute
is
written
in
the
present
tense.
it
talks
about
an
entity
that
is
a
separate
legal
person,
and
a
majority
of
whose
shares
or
other
ownership
interest
is
owned
by
a
foreign
state,
and
when
the
action
was
filed,
there
was
no
such
ownership,
so
how
do
we
even
get
to
the
first
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
plan
to
address
the
other
question--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
statute
does
refer
to
other
ownership
interests.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
other
forms
of
ownership.
what
does
that
cover,
then?
