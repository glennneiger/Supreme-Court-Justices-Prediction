mr.
peter
r.
paden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
dead
sea
bromine
company
is
an
instrumentality
of
israel
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
for
three
principal
reasons.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
no...
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
at
the
time
this
suit
was
filed,
the
company
had
been
privatized.
it
was
privatized
in
1995.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
i
certainly
intend
to
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
the
three
reasons,
in
sum,
are
that,
throughout
the
period
of
time
giving
rise
to
the
claims,
israel
owned
a
majority
of
the
shares
or
other
ownership
interests
in
the
company.
we
contend
that
this
broad
phrase
plainly
encompasses
the
majority
ownership
of
dead
sea
bromine
that
israel
indisputably
possessed
through
a
tiered
ownership
structure.
secondly,
a
contrary
interpretation
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
basic
purposes
of
the
act.
the
same
policy
that
congress
found
applicable
to
directly
owned
entities
apply
equally
to
their
subsidiaries
where
the
foreign
state
retains
a
majority
interest.
to
restrict
instrumentalities
to
entities
in
which
states
hold
legal
title
to
the
shares
of
stock
would
exclude
a
large
number
of
the
very
types
of
state-owned
commercial
enterprises,
shipping
and
airlines,
mining
operations
and
the
like,
that
congress
specifically
intended
to
bring
within
the
reach
of
the
statute.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
don't
disagree
that
that
would
be
a
rational
disposition,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
indication
in
the
case
law,
and
there
have
been
numerous
cases
where
tiered
entities
have
appeared
before
courts,
that
it's
posed
any
particular
problem
to
identify
the
tiered
ownership
structure.
i...
i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases
where...
where
that's
posed
an
enormous
issue,
and
the
computation
of
ownership
and
corporate...
corporate
responsibility
for
subsidiaries
is
an
issue
that
lawyers
deal
with
every
day
in
commercial
litigation,
and
lawyers
have
well-established
techniques
to
ferret
out
the
corporate
change
of
ownership
and
it's...
it's
done
all
the
time.
we
don't
think...
it
clearly
can
be
an
issue,
but
we
don't
think
that
that's
a
particularly
insurmountable
issue
here,
and,
in
fact,
there's
certainly
no
indication--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--so
long
as
the
state's
ownership
interest
is
the
majority
ownership
interest,
your
honor,
there
could
be--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--that's
correct.
our
position
would
be
that
so
long
as
the
state's
interest
is
a
majority
interest,
that
would
be
the
limiting
principle,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
words
of
the
statute
seem
to
us
to
suggest--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--well,
the
statute
says
majority
ownership,
your
honor,
and
we
think
that--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--it
says
a
majority
ownership
interest,
your
honor,
and
we
think
a
majority
ownership
interest
is
about
as
broad
a
term
as...
as
could
be
conjured
up
to
try
to
describe
generically
the
concept
of
ownership.
i
think
congress
had
in
mind
that
this
statute
was
going
to
apply
to
entities
from
nations
all
around
the
world,
with
many
different
kinds
of
economic
systems,
and
in
some
countries
the
notion
of
ownership
isn't
even
so
clearly
established.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
that's
true.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
there
is.
there
are
certainly
other
kinds
of
ownership
in
our
legal
system...
partnership
interests
are
an
obvious
example...
which
don't
necessarily
refer
to
share
ownership.
but
ownership
interest
is
a
very,
very
broad
term,
and
it...
we
think
that
if
congress
had
intended
this
to
be
so
specifically
limited
to
direct...
directly
owned
entities,
it
would
have
said
directly
owned--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--well,
we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
phrase
needs
to
be
read
as
a
whole,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
a
situation,
when
the
statute
is
read
as
a
whole,
that
the...
that
the
principle
of
redundancy
and
superfluousness
which
judge
kozinski
felt,
decided
in
this
case
dictated
the...
the
restriction
to
direct
ownership
should
apply.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
i...
i
think
that
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
requires
a
comment.
i
think
that
the...
the
structure
of
this
statute
very
uniquely
reflects
our
federalist
system,
and...
and
the...
this
alleged
disparity
between
treatment
in
this
country
and
other
countries
i
think
is
something
of
a
red
herring.
congress
for
the
most
part,
in
establishing
this
system,
i
believe
it's
fair
to
say
contemplated
that
commercially
owned
ventures
of
foreign
states
would
be
subject
to
suit,
that--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--i
think
there's
an
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
in...
in
foreign
nations,
an
entity
would
be
subject
to
suit,
but
it
would
typically
be
subject
to
suit...
i
don't
think
there
are
too
many
foreign
countries
that
have
our
federalist
system,
and
certainly
not
too
many
foreign
countries
that
have
our
deeply
ingrained
right
to
a
jury
trial.
congress,
for
the
most
part,
was
saying
these
suits
should
go
forward.
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
was
to
bring
commercially
owned
ventures
of
foreign
states
within
the
subject
of...
of
litigation
and
make
them
susceptible
to
claims,
but
congress
said
that
in
doing
that,
because
of
potential
sensitivities
that
could
exist,
they
would
accord
those
entities
the
same
kinds
of
privileges
that
the
federal
government
gets
when
the
federal
government
waives
its
immunity,
so
that--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--my
sense
is
that
the
congress'
concern
about
sensitivities
was...
was
a
little
different
than
that.
i
don't
think
the
notion
was
offense
at
being
sued.
i
think
the
notion
is
that
foreign
states
would
have
a...
an...
a...
an
interest,
potentially...
not
in
every
single
case,
but
potentially
significant
interest
in
the
manner
and
treatment
of
claims
against
entities
that...
that
they
owned.
they
may
have--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
there...
there
are
cases,
but
i
think
they're
quite
rare,
where
a
commercial
entity
might
actually
be
able
to
contend
that
it
has
immunity,
but
for
the
most
part,
congress
was
thinking--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--well,
we've
pled
it
in
our
answer,
your
honor,
but
the
issue
has...
has
not
been
crossed
in
this
particular
case,
because
the
judge
in...
in
the
district
court
held
that
we
weren't
even
a
foreign
state,
so
the
question
didn't
even
arise.
there
are...
whether
or
not
an
entity
is
immune,
of
course,
if
it
is
a
foreign
state,
depends
upon
whether
one
of
the
exceptions
in
the
statute
applies,
and
the
commercial
activity
exception
requires
direct
effects
on
the
united
states,
and
so
forth.
there's...
there
are
issues
of
treaty
waivers,
there
are
a
number
of
issues--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--i
think
you
can
assume
that,
your
honor,
but
i
think--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--we
get
to
the
first
question,
your
honor,
because
the
use
of
the
present
tense
does
not
clearly
indicate
the
point
in
time
at
which
the
present
tense
exists.
this
statute
uses
the
present
tense
in
many
circumstances
in
some
of
the
subsequent
provisions
that
discuss
immunity
to
discuss
actions
that
clearly
took
place
at
the
time
the
events
arose.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
i
don't...
the
font,
the
jurisdictional
font
of
this
statute,
your
honor
is
not
diversity,
it's
federal
question.
this
court--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--i
think
that's
going
to
have
to
be
an
issue
that
is
decided
in...
in
cases
as
they
develop.
there
have
been
some
cases
where
entities
were
privatized
during
the
course
of
litigations,
and
courts,
i
believe,
have
consistently
held
that
in
that
case,
the
immunity...
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
jurisdictional
premise
is
not
lost
because
it
existed
at
the
time
of
the
claim.
the
preponderant
case
law
here,
your
honor,
has
been
to
look
either
to
the
time
of
the
acts
that
gave
rise
to
the
claim,
or
to
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
suit,
and
there's
a...
a
nice
opinion
by
judge
kaplan
in
the
southern
district,
in...
in
the
belgrade
case,
which
kind
of
synthesizes
those
cases.
we...
the...
in
the
jurisdictional
determination
under
this
statute,
the
way
it's
structured,
a
court
very
frequently
has
to
look
at
the
acts
giving
rise
to
the
claim
in
order
even
to
decide
if
it
has
jurisdiction,
because,
as
your
honor
will
recall,
in
section
1330,
jurisdiction
depends
upon
a
determination,
a)
that
a
party
is
a
foreign
state,
and
b)
that
one
of
the
exceptions
applies,
and
most
of
those
exceptions
require
an
examination,
whether
or
not
the
acts
that
gave
rise
to
the
claim
were
commercial
in
nature,
where
they
took
place,
so
that
the...
it's
not
at
all
unusual
in
the
context
of
this
statute
to
say
that
the
actions
that
gave
rise
to
the
claim
are
the
point
of
reference
for
the
jurisdictional
determination.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
your
honor,
we
think
that
looking
at
the
time
of
the
events
that
gave
rise
to
the
claim
is
the
approach
that
most
closely
comports
with
the
policies
and
purposes
behind
this
act.
what
congress
was
sensitive
about
is
when
the
actions
of
foreign
state
instrumentalities
are
called
before
the
courts
of
the
united
states
to
be
adjudicated,
and
congress
indicated
that
there
were
sensitivities
in
those
situations
that...
should
be
respected
by
according
a
broad
right
to
hear
in
court--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--well,
there's
probably
a
statute
of
limitations
claims
on
that,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the...
whether
the
acts
that
gave
rise
to
the
claim
are
at
issue
in
the
case,
and
i
don't
think
it's
difficult
to
imagine--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--well,
your
honor,
except
for
judge
kozinski
below,
every
circuit
court
that
has
looked
at
this
and
looked
at
the
legislative
history
has
concluded,
as
did
the
aba
working
group,
which
recently
did
an
extensive
study
of
this
statute,
and
that
group
was
made
up
of
prominent
international
relations
professors
and
practitioners,
that
actions
of
foreign
states
remain
potentially
politically
sensitive
even
after
an
entity
is
sold.
the
potential
here
is
the
point.
this
is
kind
of
a
prophylactic
statute.
i
don't
think
anybody's
saying
that
in
each
and
every
case,
there
will
be
intense
foreign
relations
issues,
but
i...
for
example,
the
foreign
state
may
very
well
have
ongoing
financial
obligations
for
pre-privatization
acts.
that's
the
case
with
one
of
the
amici
before
the
court
today
in
the
state
of
france.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
well,
two
responses,
if
i
may.
first
of
all,
we're
not
suggesting
that
it
should
only
be
the
time
of
the
events
that
gave
rise
to
the
claim.
we
believe
the
appropriate
rule
is
the
rule
expressed
in
the
consensus
of
case
law
today,
that
it
would
be
either
the
time
the
claim
was
filed,
or
the
time
of
the
acts.
but
your
question
about
section...
section
1330
is...
is
a
very
good
question.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
1332,
that
refers
to
claims
by
foreign
states.
when
a
foreign
state
entity
is...
is
a
plaintiff
and
chooses
to
come
to
this
court.
the...
the
statute
that
we're
alluding
to
is
when...
when
people
are
trying
to
assert
claims
against
these
entities
and...
and
bring
them
into
court
and
have
their
actions
adjudicated
in
courts
that
the
state--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--the
instrumentality
has
a
choice
whether
or
not
to
come
to
court
in
that
circumstance,
your
honor,
and
invoke...
and...
and--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--the...
the--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--i
don't
think--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--i
believe
that
if
the
acts
at...
at
stake
took
place
at
the
time
it
was
a
foreign
sovereign,
it
should
be
able
to
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
that's
correct.
i
think
the
question...
whether
or
not
an
entity
is
a
foreign
state,
the
analysis
is
the
same,
but
for
purposes
of
when
that
analysis
is
pertinent,
it
may
be
different.
it
may
be
different
when
we're
talking
about
what...
the
rules
about
execution
of
judgments
than
at
the
time
of
filing
a
claim.
the...
the
opposite
rule,
we
think,
leads
to
greater
anomalies.
under
the
opposite
rule,
you...
there's
a
very
clear
prospect.
there's
almost
an
inevitability
that
liabilities
attributable
to
acts
of
state
instrumentalities
are
going
to
be
adjudicated
outside
the
structure
and
protections
of
this
act.
state
court
juries
all
around
the
country
will
be
sitting
in
judgment
on
acts
of
state-owned
entities,
and
that
is
fundamentally
contrary
to
what
congress
wanted
to...
to
have
happen.
in
this
very
case
i
think
we...
we
posed
a
hypothetical
that,
if
we
just
change
the
facts
significantly
but
slightly,
if...
if
dead
sea
bromine
was
the
sole
manufacturer
of
the
toxic,
the
pesticide
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
if
dead
sea
bromine,
the
acts
of
a...
an
instrumentality
of
the
state
of
israel,
closely
monitored
and
overseen
through
the
government
company's
law
structure,
have
been
alleged
to
be
the
sole
manufacturer
of
this
product,
the
man...
the
party
that
sought
and
obtained
approvals
through,
as
alleged
in
the
complaint,
not
being
entirely
candid
about
known
health
risks,
had
knowingly
marketed
it
in
the
third
world,
had
been...
whose
actions
had
been
called
appalling
by
senator
leahy
in
a
public
hearing,
if
that
entity
was
on
trial
before
a
lot
of
different
juries
in
various
parts
of
texas
and
louisiana,
being
called
up
as
a
israeli
chemical
company
who
had
done
all
these
things,
i
think
it's
not
at
all
difficult
to
imagine
that
the
state
of
israel
might
have
some
interest
in
that
case.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
that's
definitely
true,
your
honor,
but
i'm
simply
trying
to
show
that
there
could
be
a
hypothetical
situation
that's
not
entirely
far-fetched,
where...
where
a
state's
ongoing
interest
in
litigation
against
an
entity
for
acts
that
took
place
when
the
state
had
responsibility
for
it
in
the
sense
that
it
owned
it,
were
at
stake.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
well--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--that's
clearly
a
policy
judgment,
and
what
we're
left
with
is
this...
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
the
purposes
and
policies
that
lay
behind
it,
and
we
think
that
with
that
information
before
us,
congress'
concern
about
the
risk
and
the
sensitivities
both
in
terms
of
uniform...
the
desirability
for
uniform
decisions
and
potential
risks
and
bias
that
can
take
place
in
multifarious
state
court
juries,
those
were
to
be
not
present
when
we
were
going
to
allow
claims
to
go
forward
against
state
entities,
and
where
the
acts
at
issue
are
the
acts
of
the
state
entity,
those
same
interests
would
seem
to
be
implicated.
many
states...
privatization,
of
course,
is
a
fairly
widespread
phenomenon
in
the
last
decade,
and
what
happened
to
our
client
has
happened
to
many
formerly
state
majority-owned
entities.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
if...
so
long
as
within
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
actions
of
a
foreign
state
instrumentality
are
at
stake,
then
it
should
be
within
the
claim.
your
honor,
this
case
poses
an
even,
i
think
more
stark
example.
as...
as
noted
by
the
court
below,
this
particular
litigation
is,
i
think
in
judge
kozinski's
words,
one
part
of
a
large
broadbased
litigation,
i
think
he
used
the
word
war.
the
delgado
case
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
was...
it
arose
out
of
cases
that
began
in
1994
in
texas,
based
on
the
same
claims,
based
upon
the
same
structure
of
parties,
and
at
that
time
we
were
majority-owned
by
israel,
so
under
the
rule
propounded
by
the
respondents
and
the
solicitor
general
there
would
be
federal
jurisdiction
over
the...
that
part
of
the
cases,
but
if
someone
waited
to
sue
until
later,
there
wouldn't
be.
i
think
credit
lyonnais
seems
to
be
in
the
same
position,
based
upon
the...
the
information
in
the...
in
the
amicus
brief.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
i'm...
i
represent
dead
sea,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
yes.
dole
is--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--dole,
i
believe...
dole
is
interested
in...
in
confirming
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
over
this
case
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
will
be
established
if
our
position
is
established,
and
to
this
extent,
we
have
a
common
interest
in
this
case,
apart
from--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--we
filed
the
removal
petition,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
dole
filed
a
supplemental
removal
petition
on
different
grounds
alleging
federal
question
jurisdiction,
which--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--correct.
that's--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--that's
correct.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
with
respect
to
the
phrase,
ownership
interest,
mr.
massey
suggested
that
the
issues
here,
and
i
believe
mr.
minear
as
well,
are
related
to
the
issues
in
the
recently
decided
meyer
case,
with
which
i
confess
i'm
not
familiar,
but
i
think
also
the
bestfoods
kind
of
case.
we
think
those
cases
are
very
different.
those
cases
relate
to
liability-creating
statutes
and,
in
the
context
of
a
statute
that
creates
liability,
whether
congress
intended
for
traditional
rules
of
corporate
veil-piercing
to
be
eased
somewhat
in
assigning
liability
in
the
case
of
the
superfund
law
to
the...
to
the
owner
of
the
contaminated
facility.
this
is
not
a
statute
that
gives
rise
to
liability.
it
defines
a
category
of
entities
that
are
within
the
scope
of
the...
of
the
group
that
congress
intended
to...
to
vest
with
a
certain
limited
protection
when
they
will
be
sued
in...
in
the
united
states,
namely,
a
broad
right
to
a
federal
forum,
and
so
forth.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the...
in
the
first
place,
of
course,
the
statute
has
to
be
construed
to
the
best
one
can
on
the
words
of
the
statute
and
the
congressional
intent.
i
think
there
is
some
interesting
language.
i...
i
believe
it's
the
delta
case
of
the
sixth
circuit,
or
maybe
the
texas
eastern
case
in
the
third
circuit...
talking
about
why,
in
the
context
of
this
law,
there
actually
should
be
a
broad
interpretation
of
diversity.
really,
that's
just
another
way
of
saying
because
congress
intended
to
bring
within
it
a
certain
defined
category
of...
of
entities.
i
think
it's
very
hard
to...
to
articulate
a
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
bring
commercial
operations
of
foreign
states
within
the
scope
of
the
statute
and
say...
let
me
back
up
a
moment.
there
was
a
time
when
dead
sea
works
was
the
immediate
parent
of
dead
sea
bromine,
and
dead
sea
works
was
owned
by
the
state
of
israel.
dead
sea
works'
job
is
to
extract
manganese
and
potassium
from
the
dead
sea.
dead
sea
bromine's
job
is
to
extract
dead...
bromine
from
the
dead
sea.
it's
impossible
to
come
up
with
a
rationale
why
congress
wanted
dead
sea
works
to
be
within
the
purpose...
the
purview
of
this
statute
and
dead
sea
bromine
not
to
be.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
correct.
i...
in
terms
of
ownership
interest,
i
think
it's...
it's
a
well-known
and
widely
used
phrase
in
our
law
as
well
as
others
to
be
a
generic
broadbased
term.
we
did
a
little
research
on
some
publicly
available
information
just
to
try
to
find
companies
that
i
think
we
can
say
are
well-known
to
be...
have
certain
relationships,
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
based
on
news
articles
and
so
forth,
that
general
electric
company
is
widely
understood
to
own
nbc,
the
broadcasting
network.
it
turns
out
that
general
electric
company
is
the
100
percent
shareholder
of
a
company
called
nbc
holdings,
inc.,
which
is
the
100
percent
shareholder
of
nbc,
inc.,
the
broadcasting
company.
i
think
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
ge
would
be
astonished
to
hear
the
united
states
and
the
respondents
explain
that
ge
does
not
have
an
ownership
interest
in
nbc.
it's--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--your
honor,
i
think
in
this
case
that...
that
we
think
that
the
respect
that
is
owed
to
the
justice
and
state
departments
in
this
case
is...
is
measured
by
the
persuasiveness
of
the
opinions
that
they're
offering.
essentially,
they're
offering
a
legal
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
congressional
intent.
i
don't
think
they've
said
that
the
interpretation
that
we're
offering
here
will
impair
or
jeopardize
the
conduct
of
our
foreign
relations.
in
fact,
the
only
comment
in
their
brief
about
this
is
to
note
that
there
have
not
been
frictions
in
foreign
relations
as
a
result
of
the
extant
state
of
the
law,
and
the
extant
state
of
the
law
is
really
in
our
favor
on
both
points.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
where
privatized
entities
have
been
held
to
be
agencies
or
instrumentalities,
and
certainly
where
tiered
entities
have
been,
so
we
think
it
really
is
a
matter
of
an
analysis
of
the
legal
opinions
about
statutory
construction
and...
and
whether--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--we're
trying
to
honor
the
intent
of
congress,
your
honor.
congress--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--i
think
what's
salient
is
what
congress
said,
your
honor,
and
congress
said
that
when
claims
are
brought,
when
we
are
going
to
allow
claims
against
foreign
state
entities
for
their
commercial
activities
or
whatever
in
this
country,
we're
going
to
accord
them
the
kinds
of...
the
federal
jurisdiction
breadth
and
lack
of
jury
trial
which
we
accord
to
ourselves
when
we
agree
to
be
sued.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
your
honor,
that
contains
a
lot
of
very
detailed
material
in
support
of
the
information
that
we
thought
pertinent
describing
the
particular
structure
of
the
government
companies
law
and
the
legal
regimes--
mr.
peter
r.
paden
--no,
sir.
it
doesn't--
[laughter]
--not
at
all.
that
had
nothing
really
to
do
with
ownership.
we...
we
actually
originally
put
that
material
in
the
record
in
support
of
our
argument
that
the
company
was
an
organ
of
the
state
of
israel
within
the
kind
of
emerging
case
law
there,
and
what
that
material
shows
is
the
extensive,
detailed
interrelationship
between
the
government
companies
authority
in
israel.
they
made
decisions
about
whether
or
not
the
company
was
going
to
have
to
use
company
cars,
about
whether
or
not
they
were...
they
made...
they
made...
they
had
input
in
the
operation
of
this
company
to
a
minute
degree
of
detail
and
to,
of
course,
very
profound
decisions
such
as
budget
decisions,
who
would
be
on
the
board
of
directors.
this
company,
under
the
government
companies
law,
a
government
subsidiary
company
is
treated,
for
all
intents
and
purpose
the
same,
whether
it's
indirectly
held,
as
a
government
company
which
is
directly
owned,
and
it...
and
this
detailed
material
is
really
in
support
of
several
pages
in
our
brief
where
we...
where
we
provide
a...
a
long
paragraph
with
a
series
of
examples
of
the
extent
of
the
interrelationship
between
the
government
of
israel,
the
ministers
of
finance,
the
government
companies
authority,
and
so
forth.
mr.
peter
r.
paden
thank
you,
your
honor.
