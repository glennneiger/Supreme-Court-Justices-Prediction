yes,
but
it's
a
lot
of
trouble
to
track
these
things
back,
you
know,
who
owns
shares
many
tiers
up,
and
congress
might
well
have
simply
determined
we
will
honor
the
sovereignty
of
other
states
when
they're
the
principal
stockholder
of
a
corporation.
where...
where
they
are
not,
we
are
not
impugning
their
sovereignty
by
going
ahead
and
permitting...
permitting
suit
against
the
entity.
that's
certainly
a
rational...
a
rational
disposition,
and
the
language
seems
to
suggest
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
your...
your
principle
would
apply
no
matter
how
many
tiers
up
they
go?
i...
i
assume
you
don't
think
the
second
tier
is
the
limit?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
the
name
of
the
state
does
not
appear
until
you
get
six
tiers
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you...
do
you
agree
with
the
respondents'
contention,
the
united
states'
contention
that
foreign
countries
would
not...
would
not
give
us
this
break,
that
generally
speaking,
in
international
law
they...
they'll
only
look
to
the
ownership
of
the
immediate
company?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
thought...
i
remember
when
they
enacted
the
fsia.
i
was
around,
and
i...
i
recollect
quite
vividly
that
its
object
was
to
bring
united
states
domestic
law
into
conformity
with
the
new,
accepted
international
determination
of
when...
when
sovereign
immunity
should
be
respected
and
when
it
shouldn't,
and
if
that's
the
case,
and
if
you
acknowledge
that
the
general
principle
internationally
is
not
to
go
beyond
the
ownership
of
the
immediate
company,
then
i
don't
know
why
language
which...
which
is
susceptible
of
that
meaning
shouldn't
be
given
that
meaning.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
they
be
sensitive
to
something
that
they're
willing
to
do
to
us?
i
mean,
the...
the
potential
sensitivity,
if...
if
they
would
hold
the
united
states
liable
in
such
a
situation,
i
mean,
would...
would
not
recognize
sovereign
immunity
of
the...
of
the
indirectly
owned
united
states
entity,
how
could
they
be
offended
by
our
doing
the
same?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
there...
i...
i
just
don't
agree
with
you
that
that's...
that's
the
policy
of
the
united
states.
there...
apart
from
who
can
get
into
federal
court,
there...
there
is
in
federal
law
a
thing
called
the
act
of
state
doctrine
under
which
we
will...
we
will
honor
and
accept
the
action
of
a
foreign
country
conducted
within
its
own
borders
and
will
not
allow
that
to
be
challenged
in
a
suit
in
the
united
states.
it's
a...
it's
a
longstanding
doctrine,
and
yet
we
do...
certainly
do
not
say
that
any
time
an
act
of
state
is
involved
in
a
piece
of
litigation,
there's
federal
jurisdiction.
this
act
doesn't
seek
to
do
that.
it
seems
to
me
the
federal
jurisdiction
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
actions
of
a
foreign
state
are
the...
are
the
subject
matter
of
the
litigation,
but
rather
whether
the
foreign
state
is
a
party
to
the
litigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
context
in
which
we
have
held
that
a
majority
ownership
of
shares,
that...
that
phrase
is
satisfied
by...
by
second-tier
ownership?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
