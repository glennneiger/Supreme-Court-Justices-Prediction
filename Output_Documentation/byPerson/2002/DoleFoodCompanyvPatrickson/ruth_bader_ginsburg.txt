justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--your
argument
would
be
stronger
if
it
were
a
stand-alone
term,
but
it
isn't.
it
comes
after
shares,
and
so
one
can
say,
well,
we're
going
to
read
ownership
interest,
shares
or
other
ownership
interest
as
something,
say,
equivalent
to
a
stock
certificate.
you...
it...
it
doesn't
just
say,
ownership
interest,
and
i
think
that
that's
why
the
statute
itself
doesn't
answer
the
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
your
point
that
there
are
no
other
countries
that
have
our
dual
federal
system
with
state
courts
and
federal
courts,
so
you're
not
urging
that
there's
substantive
sovereign
immunity.
you're
saying,
on
the
jurisdiction
side,
you
should
have
a
right,
or
congress
meant
to
give
you
a
right
to
have
access
to
federal
court
rather
than
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
contending
that
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
purposes
of
your
argument
now,
can
we
assume
that
you
are
not
claiming
the
substantive
immunity
and
the
question
is
a
forum
question,
whether
you
can
have
access
to
a
federal
forum?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
paden,
if
you
would
look
particularly
to
the
diversity
statute,
and
now
there's
a...
a
provision
that
expressly
deals
with
a
foreign
state,
everything
else
in
diversity,
you
would
agree,
it
depends
on
the
time
suit
was
brought,
and
so
if
you
moved
in
the
interim...
there
was
diversity
when
it
happened,
but
you
move
in
the
interim,
when
the
complaint
is
filed
there's
no
more
diversity.
i
take
it
you're
asking
us,
within
the
very
same
statute,
1332(a),
to
interpret
a
foreign
state
differently
so
that
its
nationality
at
the
time
of
suit
doesn't
count,
only
at
the
time
of
the
act,
and
that
would
be
anomalous
within
very
same
provision,
1332(a),
that
you
would
treat
one
one
way,
citizens
of
different
states,
that
has
to
be
as
of
the
time
the
complaint
is
filed,
but
a
foreign
state
only
at
the
time
the
event
occurred.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
1332
i'm--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you're
saying
in
court...
to
be
a
plaintiff,
the
foreign
state
would
have
to
be...
it
would
have
to
be
a
foreign
entity
at
the
time
suit
was
brought?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
it...
it
chooses
to.
it...
does
it
have
access?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
does
it
have
to
qualify
as
a
foreign
instrumentality
when
it
brings
the
suit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
it's
been
privatized.
can
it
come
into
federal
court
and
say,
we
were
at
the
time
of
this
incident
that
we're
suing
about?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
those
are...
then
you
are
interpreting
within
the
very
same
statute
a
citizen
of
a
state
would
be
treated
one
way,
or
a...
a...
an
entity
that
was
once
a
foreign
state
but
is
no
longer
would
be
treated
another
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you've
made
another
significant
change,
because
it
wasn't
the
plaintiffs
who
brought
the
israeli
corporations
into
this
action.
the
plaintiffs
sued
dole,
i
thought,
and
dole
impleaded
the
israeli
company.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
paden,
because--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you...
did
you
join
in
removing,
or
did
dole
file
the
removal
petition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
that's
how
it
got
up
to
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
massey--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we're
trying
to
find
out,
not
was...
what
congress
did
was
reasonable--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
what
did
congress
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
of
course
if
it...
what
it
did
was
reasonable,
that...
nobody
could
doubt
that
that
would
be
fine,
and
in
determining
what...
what
congress
did,
the
petitioners
pointed
to
a
number
of
statutes
that
use
the
word,
directly,
when
they
meant
to
cut
out
the
subsidiaries.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
say,
shares,
or...
or
a
company
directly
owned
by,
and
this
statute
is
silent.
it
doesn't
say,
directly
owned.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
paden
said
that
that
(a)(4)
would
be
interpreted
by
the
different
rule,
so
he's
being
consistent
with--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
massey,
practically,
is
it
so
in
these
litigations
that
if
you
can't
remove
to
the
federal
court,
the
state
courts
keep
them
and
try
them,
whereas
if
you
remove
them
to
the
federal
court,
they
are
then
dismissed
on
forum
nonconvenience?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
this
category
of
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
that
the
general
pattern?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
that
was
conceded,
that
for
purposes
of
newspapers
reports,
and...
yeah,
we
understand
that
you
would
have
five
tiers
down,
if
only
one
person
owns
it,
you
say,
well,
that
person
owns
it,
even
if
it's
the
fifth
tier
down,
but
the
question
is,
in
this
context
of
a
jurisdictional
statute...
and
i
wanted
to
ask
you
particularly,
you've
just
heard
mr.
minear's
argument,
do
we,
as
a
court,
owe
any
special
respect
to
what
the
executive
tells
us
a
statute
that
deals
in
the
foreign
affairs
realm
means?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
the
government
says
you
are
the
one
who's
saying,
oh,
a
foreigner
might
be
offended
by
the
jury
trial,
whatever.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
the
government
answers
no,
that
we
don't
think
this
is
going
to
be
disturbing
foreign
nations.
you're
the
one
who
says
that
it
will.
