mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
the
fsia
against
the
backdrop
of
venerable
corporate
law
principles,
including
the
principle
that
a
parent
corporation
and
subsidiary
are
distinct,
and
that
the
shareholders
of
a
parent
corporation
are
not
the
shareholders
of
a
subsidiary
corporation.
we
submit
that
the
fsia
refers
to
share
ownership
in
that
familiar
legal
sense.
viewed
in
that
light,
a
foreign
state's
majority
ownership
of
the
shares
of
a
parent
gives
the
foreign
state
control
over
the
subsidiary,
but
it
does
not
give
that
foreign
state
ownership
of
the
subsidiary's
shares.
if
congress
had
intended
that
the
fsia
would
extend
agency
or
instrumentality
status
to
the
foreign
state's
control
of
the
subsidiary,
it
could
easily
have
said
exactly
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
there's
a
very
strong
textual
indication
that
that's
not
a
correct
reading,
and
that
is
found
in
section
1623(b)(2),
where
it
speaks
of
a
majority
of
whose
shares
or
other
ownership
interest
is
owned
by
the
foreign
state,
or
political
subdivision
thereof.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
now,
obviously,
if
congress
had
intended
that
recursive
use
that
you've
described,
they
would
not
have
included,
political
subdivision
thereof,
which
is
also
a
part
of
a
foreign
state
and,
in
fact,
that
provision
excludes
agency
or
instrumentality.
we
think
what
the
court
can
draw
from
this
is
that
congress
was
using
foreign
state
in
a
very
strict
sense
of
simply
a
foreign
nation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
think
there
are
two
very
clear
reasons.
first
of
all,
congress
was
drawing
a
bright
line.
we
think
that
congress
wanted
to
avoid
litigation
over
where
to
litigate.
nothing's
more
wasteful
than
that...
and
by
doing
so
it
spoke
to
ownership
of
majority
of
shares
in
the
traditional
legal
sense,
which
provides
a
very
bright
line
rule.
we
also
think
that
this...
this
reading
must
be...
must
take
into
account
that
we're
not
speaking
solely
of
the
interest
of
foreign
nations,
but
also
of
the
interest
of
american
litigants.
congress
was
trying
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
two,
and
the
balance
that
we
suggest
here
is
one
that
recognizes
that
american
litigants
have
an
interest
in
a
clear
delineation
of
who
is
entitled
to
foreign
sovereign
status
and
who
is
not.
we
think
our
interpretation
reflects
both
of
those
concerns.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
it--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--again,
your
honor,
we
think
that
it
ought
to
be...
that
this
term
ought
to
be
interpreted
in
terms
of
a...
a
test
that
provides
a
bright
line
rule.
we
think
other
ownership
interest
refers
to
something
that
is
an
alternative
to
shares,
such
as,
as
justice
kennedy
has
described
in
ownership
in...
in
a
joint
venture.
we
don't
think
that
congress
intended
to
complicate
the
inquiry
by
making
inquiries
into
whether
something
that
is
sometimes
described
as
control
should
be
treated
as
a
different
type
of
ownership
interest.
we
think
that
here,
that
what
congress
was
seeking
was
clarity,
and
the
interpretation
that
we're
providing
is
designed
to
provide
that
clarity
for
foreign
nations
and
for
american
litigants
as
well.
now,
we
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
congress
drew
this
line
with
the
understanding
that
foreign
instrumentalities
is
a
narrow
term,
particularly
as
used
by
foreign
nations.
foreign
nations
by
and
large
would
not
provide
immunity
to
corporations.
we
believe
that
congress
took
the
step
of
extending
it
to
a
first-tier
corporation,
but
concluded
that
that
is
where
the
line
should
be
drawn,
it
should
go
no
further,
and
we
think
a
narrow
construction
of
this
term
is
also
appropriate
in...
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
congress
is
granting
a
special
privilege,
a
comity-based
privileged,
that
not
ought
to
be
extended
beyond
what
other
foreign
nations
recognize
in
applying
their
immunity
laws
to
the
united
states.
this
is
particularly
so
when
the
construction
that
we
urge
is
very
likely
to
lead
to
foreign
friction
with
other
nations.
because,
as...
because
foreign
nations
do
not
recognize
the
immunity
that's
being
sought
here
in
their
own
courts,
it's
very
unlikely
that
they
will
object
to
our
recognition
of
nonimmunity
on
the
same
basis
in
our
courts.
now,
even
if
this
court
concluded
that
the
fsia
granted
agency
or
instrumentality
status
to
subsidiaries,
the
dead
sea
companies
would
still
not
qualify
because,
as
noted
before,
they
did...
did
not
have
that
status
at
the
time
that
this
suit
was
brought.
we
think
that
the
diversity
statute
model
provides
the
appropriate
test
here.
diversity
jurisdiction
is
predicated
on
whether
or
not
the
parties
are
diverse
at
the
time
the
suit
is
brought.
it's
based
on
the
status
of
the
parties.
likewise,
jurisdiction
that
is
based
on
the
status
of
a
foreign
entity
ought
to
be
determined
at
the
foreign
ownership's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
the
question
here
is,
who
exactly
are
they
suing?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
they
might
be
suing--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
that
suit
most
likely
has
to
be
served
on
someone,
and
it's
likely--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
think
it's
unlikely
to
be
a
problem.
i
cannot
say
that
we...
we
can...
can
certify
that
this
problem
would
never
arise,
but
typically,
these
types
of
suits
are
brought
against
another
state
that
now
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
former
state,
and
there
might
be
interesting
questions
of
law
with
regard
to
the
liability
of
that
suit,
but
they
may
never
be
reached
because
in
that
case,
the
suit
is
being
brought--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
think
it
is
primarily
a
theoretical
problem.
we
think
that
congress
had
no
compelling
reasons
to
provide
immunity
for
past
agencies
and
instrumentalities
that
are
no
longer
associated
with
the
foreign...
foreign
state.
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
there's
other
mechanisms,
such
as
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
that
provide
protection
of
the
foreign
sovereign
interests
in
those
cases
and,
in
any
event,
a
foreign
corporation,
even
after
it
has
become
privatized,
still
has
access
to
federal
court
jurisdiction
under
the
alienage
diversity
statute,
provided
that
it
satisfies
the...
the
requirements
that
congress
has
set
forth.
finally,
i'd
like
to
note
that
because
two
questions
are
presented
here,
the
court
does
have
discretion
to
reach
both
of
those
questions,
and
we
think
that
there
would
be
an
advantage
in
clarity
in
the
law
if
the
court
did
address
both
the
so-called
tiering
question
and
the
timing
question,
since
they
both
have
led
to
disputes
among
litigants
in
the
lower
courts.
they...
both
issues
have
been
fully
briefed
and,
as
i
say,
the
court
does
have
that
power
to
make
that
determination
if
it
so
chooses.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
most
likely
would
not
apply--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
this
situation
because
obviously,
the
act
of
state
doctrine
applies
to
the
acts
of
a
foreign
state
in--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--within...
within--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--its
own
territory,
within
is
own
jurisdiction.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
your
honor.
