justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
at
page
20
of
the
respondent's
brief
we
have
four
different
interpretations,
possible
interpretations
of
the
acts
set
forth.
do
we
have
to
choose
among
those
in
order,
as
a
predicate
before
reaching
the
constitutional
issue,
and
i'll
just...
and
this
is
in
line
with
justice
o'connor's
question.
if
we
took
the
most
expansive
view
of
the
alternatives
that
she
presents,
then
the
opinion
that
we
would
write,
it
seems
to
me,
would
be
different
than
if
we
took
the
more
narrow,
the
most
narrow
view,
and
that
leads
me
to
the
question,
do
we
have
to
have
a
statutory
construction
at
the
beginning
point
of
our
holding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--go
to
the
police
department
under
this
uniform
federal
form
you
were
telling
us
about
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said
at
the
outset
that
there's
a
uniform
document
for
collisions
or
crashes
or
something.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
police
department
fills
it
out.
can
you
go
to
the
police
department
and
get
that
information?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
then
justice
souter's
hypothetical
is
different
from
this.
you
said
in
justice
souter's
hypothetical
that
you
could
go
to
that
department
and
get
the
document,
but
if
you
go
to
the
police
department
you
can't
get
the
document.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
a
somewhat
different
question,
although
i'm
not
sure
we've
resolved
the
point
that
we've
been
inquiring
about.
would
a
state
have
the
right
to
waive
this
privilege?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
allow
those
challenges
all
the
time
in
separation
of
powers
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
couldn't
you
say
the
same
thing
for
the
executive
and
the
legislature
in
a
case
like
chadha?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
don't
you
think
that
our
opinion
in
the
commerce
clause
case,
in
order
to
have
persuasive
force,
should
begin
with
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
recognize
that
a
privilege
can
be
waived
or
not
waived?
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
see
how
this
opinion
can
be
written
when
we're
not
sure
of
the
reach
of
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
set
forth
four
alternative
interpretations
at
page
20
of
your
brief.
do
any
of
the
documents
involved
in
either
of
the
tort
action
or
the
pda
action
comprise
just
those
set
forth
in
your
category
1,
which
is
reports
and
data
that
the
state
agency
actually
prepares
itself?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
some
of
the
documents
you
requested
fit
naturally
within
your
category
1?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
they
fall
in
category
2?
can
you
tell
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
documents
the
agency
has
in
its
possession?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
goes
to
the
waiver
point.
i
assume
the
state
can
waive
it
if
its
citizens
instruct
it
to
do
so,
or
maybe
not.
the
government
says
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
hypothetical
is
that
the
state
could
waive
it
if
it
wanted
to.
that's
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--hypothetical
question.
