would
you
help
us
figure
out
how
to
interpret
this
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
says
data,
highway
safety
data
compiled
or
collected
by
a
state.
now,
i
suppose
that
in
a
crossing
like
we
have
here,
where
there
might
have
been
accidents
from
time
to
time,
that
there
would
be
police
reports
or
highway
officer
reports
of
motor
vehicle
accidents
at
that
site,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
those
presumably
are
not
either
compiled
or
collected
for
the
purpose
of
getting
highway
funding
from
the
federal
government.
they're
compiled,
i
gather,
to
serve
the
normal
functions
of
law
enforcement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
don't
you
suppose
that
at
least
in
some
jurisdictions,
maybe
not
tacoma,
but
in
some
jurisdictions
you
will
find
just
ordinary
police
reports--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
accidents,
and
sometime
later,
perhaps
the
state
might
decide,
or
the
county,
i'd
like
to
have
some
federal
money
to
make
some
changes
at
that
crossing,
and
maybe
we
can
use
some
of
the
data
to
assemble
it
to
try
to
apply
for
federal
money.
now,
how
should
we
interpret
that
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
your
point
is
that
the
police
officers
are
using
a
kind
of
a
unified
federal
traffic
report--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--when
there's
an
accident?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
that's
our
question,
and
you
might
bear
in
mind
if
you
wish
that
i
think
we
generally
construe
evidentiary
privileges
narrowly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
documents
created
not
for
the
purpose
of
getting
federal
funds,
not
for
section
152,
but
for
some
other
purpose,
some
of
which
are
later
incorporated
in
a
federal
funding
application--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--by
a
different
agency?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
differ
from
petitioner
in
your
reading
of
the
statute.
yours
is
much
narrower,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
clement,
one
of
the
arguments
made
by
respondent
guillen
is
that...
is
a
tenth
amendment
argument.
do
you
think
he
has
standing
to
make
that
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
see
how
you
can
characterize
section
409
as
a
condition.
it's
an
incentive
provided
to...
for
the
state
to
participate
in
this
federal
funding
program.
the
federal
government
hopes
to
get
information
from
the
state,
and
thinks
that
they'll
be
more
apt
to
get
it
by
providing
the
protections
of
section
409.
i
don't
see
it
as
a
condition
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
why
not?
it's
a
necessary
and
proper
means
of
ensuring
that
the
federal
money
is
spent
wisely
and
efficiently.
now,
i
don't
see
the
big
issue
there,
frankly.
