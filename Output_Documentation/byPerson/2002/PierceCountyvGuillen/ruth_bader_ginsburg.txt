justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
be
plain,
do
you
mean
that
everything
that
goes
to
the
public
works
department,
everything
that
eventually
gets
to
the
public
works
department
and
is
relevant
to
the
safety
of
highway
crossings
is
exempt
from
discovery?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
could
get
a
police
report
of
an
accident.
isn't
that
standard
routine
in
negligence
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
is
there
that
suggests
that
congress
wanted
to
change
the
game
to
that
extent?
one
can
understand
what
you've
suggested
before,
wanting
to
keep
personal
injury
plaintiffs
in
the
same
place
they
were
before
this
legislation,
but
your
interpretation
takes
away
from
plaintiffs
things
that
they
would
have
had
access
to
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
just,
in
response
to
the
chief's
question,
said
that
at
least
the
police
report
of
this
accident
was
routine.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
these
rights,
is
it
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
trial
court?
i
mean,
it
would
be
one
thing
to
say
it's
mandatory,
it's
a
federal
requirement,
and
now
you're
suggesting
that
the
lawyer
can
overlook
it,
and
the
court
could
or
must
act
on
its
own?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
this
be
enforced
by
the
federal
government?
i
understand,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
the
federal
funding
is
not
tied
to
the
409
privilege,
but
is
tied
to
the
152
reporting
obligations,
so
what
federal
enforcement
would
there
be
for
a
county
that
says,
we
think
it's
fair
for
the
plaintiff
to
have
accident
reports,
so
we'll
give
them.
what
federal...
how
would
that
mandatory
requirement
that
you
just
stated
be
enforced
by
the
federal
authorities?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
that
the
409
privilege
is
not
simply
a
right
of
the
state
agency,
but
is...
that
the
funding
depends
on
the
state's
asserting
that
privilege?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
clement,
there
was...
you
said
that
the
pda
suit,
the
four
documents
were
required
to
be
turned
over
under
that,
but
i
thought
the
washington
supreme
court
said
that
accident
reports
from
nonofficers,
from
witnesses,
would
not
be
disclosable
under
the
pda,
though
they
would
be
subject
to
discovery
under
rule
26(b),
so
the
notion
that
the
pda
suit
was
the
one
that
determined
that
these
four
documents
were
required
to
be
turned
over,
i
don't
understand
that,
because
i
thought
there
was
one
part
at
least,
the
reports
from
nonofficers,
that
the
county
prevailed
on
before
the
washington
supreme
court,
but
that
it
was
a
pyrrhic
victory
because
they
lost
on
that
point
under
26(b).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
read
the
decision
to
say
that
these
documents
are
not
disclosable
under
our
freedom
of
information
act,
nevertheless
they
can
be
discovered
in
a
civil
litigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
congress
makes
that
judgment,
don't
we
owe
it
substantial
deference?
that
is,
we're
not
going
to
sit
as
a
committee
of
congress
to
determine
whether
there's
a
link
between
the
condition
of
these
intersections
and
vehicles
going
in
and
out
of
states.
if
congress
made
that
judgment,
it's
not
for
us
to
question
it,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
just
to
back
up
for
a
moment
to
address
the
question
that
mr.
clement
did
about
the
separateness
of
these
two?
is
there
anything
in
the
tort
action
that
you
are
seeking
that's
different
from
the
pda
action,
or
are
these
essentially
two
actions
seeking
the
same
material?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
way
you
interpreted
it,
although
you
say
it's
debatable,
is
that
everything
that
falls
under
the
pda,
everything
that...
those
four
documents,
those
are
not
available
to
you.
that's
what
mr.
clement
said,
i
think,
that
that's
what
rendered
the
pda
action
final.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
construction
put
forward
by
the
solicitor
general,
as
i
understand
it,
is
you
can
get
it
from
the
agency,
like
a
law
enforcement
agency,
but
not
from
the
public
works
department
if
the
purpose
is
to
implement
the
federal
program.
that's
the
government's
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
under
that
position,
i
suppose,
in
the
day
when
we
have
this
great
data
base
and
all
reports
are
there
initially,
then
under
the
government's
approach,
everything
would
be
exempt
from
discovery.
do
you
read
their
position
to
say
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you'd
have
another--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
the
list
whether
or
not
you
have
any
federal
money,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
this
is
not
tied
to
federal
spending.
that's
what
you
seem
to
be
saying.
that
it's
independent
federal
obligation
on
the
states
whether
or
not
they
receive
any
federal
money.
is
that
how
you
read
152?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
aren't
we
losing
sight
of
the
fact,
the
rather
plain
fact
that
the
states
and
the
counties
wanted
this?
they
weren't
satisfied
with
the
program
originally
because
they
feared
these
documents
would
be
discoverable,
and
make
the
county
liable.
do
you
have
another
spending
clause
case
where
the
states
and
the
counties
came
to
congress
and
said,
please
give
us
a
privilege,
and
then
say,
well,
now
it's
mandatory
and
it's
some
kind
of
a
club
rather
than
a
carrot?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
very
provision
they
wanted,
not
the
thing
in
general.
