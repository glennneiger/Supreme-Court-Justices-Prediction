mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
from
the
enactment
of
the
1966
highway
safety
act,
a
congressional
report,
specifically
number
17
to
the
89th
congress,
which
is
quoted
on
page
2
of
the
blue
brief,
congressional
reports
noted
that,
quote,
no
other
part
of
the
state
program
is
as
basic
to
ultimate
success,
nor
as
demanding
of
complete
cooperation,
end
quote,
as
state
collection
of
accident
reports,
because
they
are
the
basis
for
hazard
identification
and
correction.
however,
soon
after
the
1973
highway
safety
act
made
accident
data
collection
a
condition
to
federal
hazard
elimination
funds
the
secretary
of
transportation
reported
to
congress
that
states
strongly
objected,
because
they
feared
that
their
collection
of
accident
data
would
be
used
against
them
in
damage
actions.
because
of
this,
unintended
liability
exposure
threatened
the
integrity
and
proper
operation
of
a
cooperative
federal-state
program
that
has
saved
thousands
of
lives--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
your
honor,
no,
that's
not
completely
correct.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
they
are
collected
and
compiled
for
purposes
of
highway
hazard
identification,
essentially,
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
well,
it's
my--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--well,
in
the...
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
the...
your
honor
is
postulating
a
situation
where
there
is
an
accident
report
purely
state
in
origin.
just
to
help
the
court,
i
don't
know
that
such
a
thing
exists
after
the
crash
data
forms.
it's
to
be
understood
that
the
department
of
transportation
has
been,
since
1966,
working
with
the
states
to
develop
a
uniform
crash
data
form,
and
that...
i
think
it's
becoming
more
and
more
successful
as
that
goes
on,
so
i'm--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--essentially--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--the
forms
are
not
all
the
same,
because
each
state
has
the
right
to
choose
how
to
put
it
together,
but
the
elements
of
the
forms
are
dramatically
federal
in
their
nature,
and
they're
federal
totally
directed
toward
the
issue
of
highway
design.
that's
why...
nation-wide
there
was
a
report
cited
by
the
washington
state
amici
and
multi-state
amicus,
amici
briefs
that
pointed
out
that
nation-wide
before
1966
there
was
no
standard
at
all.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
the
county's
position,
and
we
believe
it's
well-founded,
is
that
the
constitutional
issue
is
not
an
excuse
for
artificially
narrowly
interpreting--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--well,
i've...
i'm
happy...
in
fact,
i
had
intended
to,
if
given
the
opportunity,
to
provide
the
court
the
way
the
county
believes
the
statute
should
be
interpreted.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
okay.
[laughter]
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
yes.
however,
as
the
court
pointed
out
on
that
issue
of
narrow
construction
that...
in
the
shapiro
case,
i
believe,
which
was
also
a
raw
data
case
whose
purpose
was
to
encourage
participation,
that
even
after
quoting
the
standard,
the
test
of
a
narrow
construction...
the
test
was
first
put
to
congress'
intent,
and
that
the
issue
of,
you
know,
that
particular
rule
of
construction
is
not
to
be
used
in
a
way
to
artificially
narrowly
interpret
what
congress
meant,
and
if
congress
meant
something,
then
that's
the
test.
to
answer
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question,
how
does
the
county
say
the
statute
should
be
interpreted,
pretty
much
we
agree
with
the
logic
of
the
united
states
solicitor
general,
but
just
would
suggest
that
the,
their
logic
be
extended
to
what
we
believe
is
the
logical
conclusion.
in
other
words,
we
disagree
with
plaintiffs
that
it
only
covers
generated
documents,
because
under
409
that's
interpretation
conflicts
with
what
this
court
has
said
the
plain
meaning
of
compiled
means,
as
this
court
has
discussed
in
the
john
doe
case
cited
to
the
court.
also,
this
reads
out
of
409
the
express
protection
also
of
data
collected,
not
just
generated.
it
ignores
the
legislative
history
of
why
409
was
amended,
and
why
it
used
the
language
compiled--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--our
reading,
your
honor,
is
that
there
should
be...
this
court
should
establish
a
bright
line
rule
that
documents
collect...
as
the
language
says,
for...
we
would
ask
the
court
to
enforce
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
reads,
documents
and
data,
quote,
compiled
or
collected
for
the
purpose,
end
quote,
of
specified
highway
safety
programs,
and
here's
the
operative
language,
quote,
shall
not
be
subject
to
discovery
or
admitted
into
evidence
in
a
federal
or
state
proceeding
or
considered
for
any
other
purposes
in
any
action
for
damages
arising
from
any
occurrence
at
a
location
mentioned
or
addressed
in
those
documents
or
data.
in
other
words--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--yes--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--yes.
i--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--yes.
there
are
specific--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--references
to
specific
types.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
it
says
data,
and
also
lists
reports,
lists...
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
i
was
trying
to
condense
it
down,
but
yes.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
what
we're
saying.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
to
the
extent
that
characterization
goes
to
the
data
that's
in
the
reports.
it's
not
to
say
that...
all
we're
saying--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--yes.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
we
believe
the...
again,
if
it
meets
the
test
of
dealing
with
an
occurrence
at
a...
again,
following
the
language
of
the
statute,
an
occurrence
at
the
location
mentioned
or
addressed
in
such
reports
in
the
damage
action,
then
that
report
that
it's
collected
and
compiled
by--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--yes.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
well--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--yes,
if
your
honor
means,
when
you
say
data,
going
to
the
report
to
get
the
data,
to...
if
you
were
to...
if
that
person
who
wanted
to
raise
that
issue
were
to
go
to
the
person
who,
or
the
entity
that
created
that
information,
and
were
to
depose
that,
those
people,
they
could
get
the
information
that
way.
all
we're
talking
about--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--yes,
you
can.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
yes,
and
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
i'm
sorry,
i
missed
the
question.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
yes.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
under
our
interpretation,
you
could
find
the
officer,
you
could
depose
the
officer,
but
you
cannot
get
the
report
if
it's
collected
and
filed
for
hazard
identification.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
no--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--no.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
yes.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
yes,
your
honor.
that's
a
distinction
that
the
cases
make--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--i
think
that
certainly
is
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
statute.
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
synthesize
how
the
courts
have
looked
at
this,
and
they
have
drawn
the
distinction
saying
that
really
what
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
put
plaintiffs
back
in
the
position
they
were
before.
all
this
mechanism
of
creating
accident
data
existed
beforehand.
that's
what
they
had
to
do.
they
didn't
have
this
silver
platter.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
your
honor,
before
the
1966
highway
safety
act
they
could
not
get
an
accident,
a
collection
of
accident
reports,
at
least
in
washington
state,
and
it's
my
understanding
nation-wide,
just
by
asking
for
them--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--yes.
if
you
knew
the...
and
that's
the
point.
you
essentially
have
to
know
what
plaintiffs
are
trying
to
find
out
to
get
the
document,
because
you
couldn't
ask
for
all
the
accidents
at
this
intersection.
you
could
ask
for
a
date
and
people
involved,
but
you
couldn't
ask
for,
give
me
all
the
accidents
at
a
particular
intersection.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
prior
to
1966,
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
that's--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--okay.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
no.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
no.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
let
me
think
about
that
for
a
minute.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
i
think
what
they
copied--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--well,
since
my
answer
would
be
strained
if
i
said
the
photo,
the
telephone
book,
what
i'm
referring
to
would
be
what
was
written
down
for
the
purposes,
and
collected
for
the
purposes--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--yes.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
the--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--the
piece
of
paper
written
for
tree
help...
and
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
the
question.
i
thought
the
court
was
asking
about
the
telephone
book.
the
telephone
book,
no.
the
piece
of
paper
that
was
written
down
from
that,
yes,
because
that's
collected
and
compiled,
and
that's
really
what
the
shots
case
said,
that
if
there's
a
question
about
this
of
whether
this
was
really
fairly
included
for
the
purposes
of
152,
then
for
that
purpose
you
have
an
in
camera
inspection.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
your
honor,
we...
respectfully,
we
disagree
with
that
characterization
of
our
position.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
the
police
report
of
this
accident,
when
you
go
and
ask
for...
and
the
reason
why
is
because...
because
of
the
highway
safety
act,
1966
highway
safety
act,
the
accident
reports
were
indexed
by
location.
you
could
go
and
get
a
specific
report
if
you
knew
the
facts
enough
of
the
accident,
but
only
that
accident
report,
not
all
of
them,
and
that
is
how
409--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--yes.
it
is
because
of
a
privilege.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
yes,
because
the
police
don't
do
that.
the
police
don't
care
about
highway
design
factors
other
than
because
the
form
asks
them
to.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that--
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
--i
think
the
purpose,
yes,
your
honor,
is
to
avoid
discouraging
states
from
participating,
and
allowing
them
to
get
accident
reports
from
the
hands
of
third
parties
does
discourage
states
from
participating.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
daniel
r.
hamilton
thank
you,
your
honor.
very
quickly...
3
minutes,
quickly...
i
would
like
to
correct
i
think
what
was
a
misstatement
by
respondent's
counsel,
or
at
least
one
of
them,
dealing
with
what
the
court
should
do
if
it
adopts
the
united
states'
position.
plaintiffs
say
that
if
you
adopt
that
position,
then
they
get
the
documents.
i'll
point
out
that
on
page
24
of
their
own
respondents'
brief
they
say
their...
interpretation
number
2,
which
they
say
the
u.s.
reflects,
they
say
on
page
24,
if
the
court
construes
the
statute
in
this
fashion,
then
a
remand
would
be
necessary
to
determine
which
specific
discovery
requests
would
be
precluded
and
which
would
be,
still
be
allowed.
they're
not
entitled,
even
under
their
own
admission,
under
the
u.s.
position,
and
in
fact
i
would
point
out
on
page
20
of
our
reply,
yellow
brief,
where
we
point
out
that
in
fact,
if
that
were
the
case,
even
if
the
u.s.
position
were
adopted,
these
particular
documents
would
have
to
be
protected.
furthermore,
obviously
there
is
some
confusion
as
to
where
we
differ
with
the
united
states,
and
it's
a
very
narrow
difference.
we
both
agree
that
generated
documents
are
protected.
we
both
agree
that
collected
and
compiled
documents
in
the
hands
of
public
works
are
protected,
and
we
both
agree
that
in
some
situations
they're
protected
in
the
hands
of
third
parties.
they,
though,
very
narrowly
define
that
in
situations
where
the
third
party
gets
it,
is
a
transferee
agency,
where
you
can
only
get
it
by
indexing,
or
where
it's
part
of
a
computer
base.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
its
own
st.
regis
paper
company
case,
where
it
addressed
a
statute
that
only
made
a
protection
when
it
was
in
the
hands
of
third
parties
or
officials,
and
it
contrasted
the
language
of
that
statute
with
other
statutes,
45
u.s.c.
section
41,
and
49-320,
whose
wording
is
almost
identical
to
409.
if
you
would
compare
those,
you
would
see
that
the
case
distinguished
those
types
of
statutes
from
a
statute
only
protecting
in
the
hands
of
third
parties.
so
whatever
409
does,
it
certainly
protects
more
than
just
in
the
hands
of
third
parties,
and
i
would
also
like
to
point
out,
the
reason
why
we
differ
from
the
u.s.,
we
believe
their
logic
is
correct
with
protecting
in
the
transferee
hands
and
in
a
computer
data
base
and
where
it's
indexed,
but
if
you
carry
that
logic
through,
we
believe
a
bright
line
rule
should
be
established
by
this
court,
because
obviously
the
state
courts
have
been
very...
some
state
courts,
a
minority
of
state
courts
have
been
very
resistant.
other
state
courts
have
been
trying
to
do
their
best
to
comply
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
some
states,
of
course,
have
found
every
opportunity
to
try
to
misinterpret
the
statute,
and
it
required
congress
at
least
twice
to
amend
the
statute
to
get
back
to
what
they
intended.
when
you
look
at
the
situation
of
why
they
wanted,
the
solicitor
general
believed
that
documents
in
the
hands
of
the
transferee
agency
are
protected,
they
said
that
the
reason
for
that
was
that
they
would
not
exist
but
for
the
planning
agency's
collection
of
that
information.
well,
so,
too,
accident
reports
would
not
exist
in
their
totally
different
form,
they
would
not
be
indexed
and
therefore
accessible,
and
they
would
not
be
in
the
county's
possession
but
for
the
highway
safety
act,
so
you
extend
that
logic
through,
then
you
come
to
a
bright
line
rule
which
we
believe
the
court
should
adopt.
