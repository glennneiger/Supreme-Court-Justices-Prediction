this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
23
u.s.c.
section
409
provides
that
materials
compiled
or
collected
for
the
purpose
of
certain
road
safety
programs
shall
not
be
subject
to
the
discovery
or
admitted
into
evidence
in
a
federal
or
state
court
proceeding.
as
initially
adopted
section
409
protected
it
from
disclosure
only
materials
compiled
for
the
prescribed
purposes.
the
phrase
or
collectibles
added
to
the
statute
in
1995.
respondents's
wife
died
in
a
car
accident
at
an
intersection
in
pierce
county,
washington.
when
respondent
sought
to
obtain
from
petitioner
documents
about
that
intersection's
accident
history,
petitioner
claims
such
information
was
protected
by
section
409.
the
washington
supreme
court
disagreed
finding
that
the
1995
amendment
to
section
409
exceeded
congress'
authority
under
the
spending,
commerce
and
necessary
and
proper
clauses.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
dismiss
the
writ
of
certiorari
with
respect
to
one
portion
of
this
case.
with
respect
to
the
remainder,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
in
light
of
the
canon
that
evidentiary
privileges
must
be
construed
narrowly,
we
conclude
that
section
409
protects
from
disclosure
only
information
compiled
or
collected
for
the
purposes
of
the
relevant
road
safety
program.
information
compiled
or
collected
for
purposes
unrelated
to
the
program
and
held
by
the
agency
that
are
regionally
compiled
or
collected
the
information
is
not
protected
by
section
409.
this
is
so
even
if
that
information
was
at
some
point
collected
by
another
agency
for
purposes
of
the
safety
program.
as
so
construed,
section
409
and
its
1995
amendment
fall
within
congress's
authority
to
regulate
the
use
of
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
and
to
regulate
and
protect
the
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
