chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
01-1229,
pierce
county
v.
ignacio
guillen.
mr.
hamilton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
that
our
court
has
always
preferred,
along
the
lines
suggested
by
justice
o'connor
and
justice
kennedy,
to
construe
a
statute
to
avoid
constitutional
problems
if
we
can,
and
certainly
the
respondents
here
at
least
suggest
there
are
several
different
constructions.
are
you
not
prepared
to
say
which
of
those
you
favor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'll
give
you
that
opportunity
right
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
could
certainly
get
a
police...
at
least
judging
from
my
own
practice
in
arizona
you
could
certainly
get
an
individual
police
report
of
an
accident.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
you
could
ask
for
the
police
report
of
the
particular
accident
that
you
were
concerned
with.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
like
to
reserve
your
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
this
simply
comes
up
during
a
trial.
a
witness
is
put
on
the
stand,
asked
about
the
preparation
of
a
report,
and
the
state
doesn't
object,
and
it
would
be
objectionable
under
the
statute.
now,
is
that
something
that
could
be
challenged
on
appeal,
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
about
a
commerce
clause
challenge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
buckley
v.
valeo
we
held
that
the
appointment
clause,
where
the
president
had
signed
the
legislation,
could
be
raised
by
private
individuals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--we
wouldn't
want
to
do
that
too
often,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
mungia,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they're
regulating
in
the
interest
of
a
commerce-type
thing
that's
preventing
automobile
accidents.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--no
state
has
to
participate
in
this
program
if
it
doesn't
want
to.
if
a
state
wants
to
turn
down
federal
money
it
can,
can
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
you
can
agree,
nonetheless,
that
a
state
can
refuse
to
participate?
you
say
you
can't,
by
reading
409,
tell
that
it
isn't
just
a
legislative
command
based
on
something
other
than
the
spending
clause,
but
don't...
you
do
agree,
don't
you,
that
if
a
state
didn't
take
the
federal
money,
it
would
not
be
bound
by
409?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
it's
just
categorical,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mungia.
mr.
hamilton,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hamilton.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-1229
pierce
county
versus
guillen
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
