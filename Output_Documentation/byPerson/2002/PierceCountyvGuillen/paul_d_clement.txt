mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
1995
amendment
to
section
409
is,
contrary
to
the
determination
of
the
washington
state
supreme
court,
constitutional.
the
provision
protects
data
that
is
compiled
and
collected
for
purposes
of
applying
for
federal
highway
funds
from
being
used
in
state
and
federal
court
litigation.
the
documents
at
issue
are
inherently
federal
in
character,
and
so
congress
has
the
power
to
prohibit
the
use
of
those
documents
in
both
federal
and
state
court
litigation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
those
documents--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
those
documents,
justice
o'connor,
would
be
discoverable
and
admissible
if
the
documents
were
sought
from
the
party
that
collected
them
for
a
purpose
different
than
the
federal
highway
funding
purposes,
but
what
the
statute,
i
think,
does
prohibit
is
somebody
going
to
the
state
highway
traffic
department
and
essentially
engaging
in
a
one-stop
shopping
enterprise
where
they
can
get
all
sorts
of
documents
that
have
been
collected--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
o'connor,
and
so
as
a
result
of
our
interpretation
of
the
statute,
the
typical
police
accident
report
can
be
obtained
from
the
police
department
and,
i
think
with
respect
to
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
the
report
about
the
tree
can
be
obtained
from
the
state
tree
department
or
the
state
environmental
department.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
a
difficult
question,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
that
as
you
know,
as
a
general
matter
evidentiary
privileges
are
waivable,
and
so...
and
that's
the
proposition
this
court
has
established
in
cases
like
menzonato
and
hill,
but
there
is
a
sense
in
which
this
privilege
exists,
in
our
view,
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
federal
government,
so
that
we
can
obtain
accurate,
complete,
and
candid
assessments
of
highway
traffic
safety
requirements,
and
so,
there's
a
suggestion,
for
example,
in
the
hill
decision
at
footnote
3
that,
when
a
third
party's
interests
are
at
stake,
that
the
court
may
not
find
waiver
under
those
circumstances
as
readily
as
it
would
otherwise,
so
our
view
i
think
would
be
that
although
the
court
need
not
definitively
resolve
it
in
this
case,
there's
a
strong
argument
that
the
privilege
would
not
be
waivable.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
the
admissibility
of
those
materials--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
there's
a
sense
in
which
it
would
violate
the
federal
statute,
but
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
department
of
transportation
is
going
to
be
able
to
leap
to
the
defense
of
the
statute
in
that
hypothetical
and
assert
the
interests
of
the
statute.
i
think,
however,
if
a
state
wanted
to
take
a
systematic
policy
of
disregarding
section
409,
i
think
that
would
implicate
the
federal
interests,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
a
state
would
be
able
to
do
it.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
so,
chief
justice.
i
think
it
is
something
that
could
be
procedurally
defaulted,
but
i
do
think
if
in
a
case
like
that
the
state
went
to
the
trial
judge
and
said,
look,
there
is
this
provision
of
federal
law,
section
409,
that
says
this
material
can't
come
in,
but
we're
happy
to
just
disregard
that
provision,
i
think
the
trial
court
might
well
be
within
its
rights
to
say
that
no,
we're
not
going
to
disregard
that
provision
of
federal
law,
we're
going
to
keep
the
material
out,
but
i
do
think
it
could
be--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
mandatory.
it
says
that
it
shall
not
be
admitted,
so
i
think
if
the
language
is
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
judge,
he
or
she
would
be
in
a
position
where
they
ought
to
exclude
the
evidence.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
under
the
circumstances
that
you're
envisioning,
justice
ginsburg,
the
federal
government
would
not
provide
funds
under
152
or
130
or
144
to
that
particular
locality.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
certainly
depends
on
the
states
or
the
localities
abiding
by
that
privilege
as
a
general
matter.
i
don't
think
a
state
or
a
locality
can
take
a
cavalier
position
of
saying,
we're
just
not
going
to
be
bound
by
the
provisions
of
this
federal
statute,
but
yet
we'd
still
like
to
take
the
money
under
those
three
statutes.
i
don't
think
that's
permissible,
and
the
reason
is,
is
that
section
409,
although
it
may
benefit
the
state
in
a
particular
litigation,
does
serve
an
important
federal
interest,
and
that
is
the
interest
in
getting
complete
and
candid
information
to
assess
and
to
award
federal
highway
funds.
by
analogy,
i
would
suggest
this
court
look
to
its
decision
in
the
buckman
company
v.
plaintiff's
committee
case,
because
in
that
case
this
court
recognized
that
the
fda
approval
process,
and
the
process
for
applying
for
fda
approval,
is
inherently
federal
in
character,
and
so
this
court
preempted
state
tort
law
that
might
distort
the
effect
of
applying
for
fda
approval.
in
the
same
way,
the
process
of
applying
for
federal
highway
funds
and
the
documents
that
are
used
for
that
purpose
have
an
inherently
federal
character,
and
so
the
federal
government
has
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
the
information
provided
to
the
federal
government
is
accurate
and
complete,
and
it
has
an
ability,
congress
has
the
power
to
take
those
essentially
federal
documents
and
protect
them
both
in
state
and
federal
court
litigation.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
the
answer
to
the
waiver
question,
unlike
the
answer
to
the
statutory
construction
question,
is
not
a
necessary
component
of
this
court's
decision.
we
think
the
better
view
is
that
it
could
be...
is
that
it
could
not
be
waived,
at
least
in
gross.
of
course,
if
it
could
be
waived,
i
think
that
is
an
additional
answer
to
any
accountability
questions
that
may
arise,
but
again,
we
think
the
better
view
is
that
it
can't
be
waived.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
the
better
view
is
that
he
doesn't
have
standing
to
raise
that
argument,
and
i'll
also
suggest
that
if
they
wanted
to
make
a
tenth
amendment
argument,
and
wanted
this
court
to
decide
the
difficult
question
of
whether
or
not
an
individual
had
standing
to
raise
a
tenth
amendment
argument,
that
they
probably
should
have
raised
the
tenth
amendment
argument
before
the
conclusion
section
of
their
brief,
and
i
think
this
court
would
be
well-advised
not
to
definitively
decide
whether
or
not
an
individual
had
standing
to
raise
a
tenth
amendment
issue.
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
all
tenth
amendment
challenges
are
created
equal,
and
i
think
therein
lies
the
difference.
if
all
the
tenth
amendment
challenge
is,
is
a
mirrored
reflection
of
congress
not
having
the
enumerated
power
to
enact
a
statute--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely.
in
those
kind
of
cases,
the
individual
does
have
standing,
but
this
court
on
various
occasions
has
suggested
that
there's
an
additional
component
to
the
tenth
amendment,
that
it's
not
just
a
reflection
of
the
enumerated
powers
of
congress,
but,
rather,
there
are
certain
special
areas
of
state
prerogatives
that
the
federal
government
can't
intrude
through
congressional
acts.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
right,
but
justice
kennedy,
i
think
there's
something
that
certainly
seems
different.
if
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
is
that
there's
some
element
of
state
sovereignty
that
congress
cannot
intrude
upon,
and
the
state
doesn't
object
to
that
intrusion,
it
seems
odd
that
the
individual
would
have
third
party
standing
to
raise
that
objection.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
again,
i
think
you
could,
and
i
think
that's
why
with
respect
to
a
more
typical
tenth
amendment
challenge
that's
based
on
an
enumerated
power,
or
the
lack
of
an
enumerated
power,
there
would
be
standing.
i
think
what
this
court
suggested--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
understand
that,
and
that
was
also
true
in
chadha.
i
think
if
there
is
a
difference,
and
this
court
suggested
there
might
be
a
difference
in
the
tva
case,
if
there
is
a
difference
it's
because
there
are
certain
tenth
amendment
challenges
that
have
the
nature
of
just
an
intrusion
on
state
sovereignty
that's
particularized.
the
hypothetical
that
the
cases
have
often
talked
about
is
moving
a
state
capital,
and
if
the
state
doesn't
object
to
moving
the
state
capital,
it's
hard
to
see
why
an
individual
ought
to
be
able
to
raise
that
question.
i
think
the
more
important
point,
though,
for
this
case
is
that
there
was
a
suggestion
to
this
effect
in
this
court's
tva
decision.
if
this
court
wants
to
revisit
that
decision,
it
probably
doesn't
want
to
do
it
in
a
case
where
the
tenth
amendment
challenge
is
not
properly
raised
and
isn't
even
raised
at
all
in
the
briefing
before
this
court
until
the
conclusionary
section
of
the
brief.
with
respect
to
the
enumerated
powers
questions,
which
i
think
are
the
gravamen
of
respondent's
case
and
the
washington
supreme
court's
decision,
there's
no
question
the
individual
has
standing.
that
was
true
in
this
case,
in
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
lopez
and
would
be
equally
true
here.
and
i
think
this
court
can
take
comfort
in
knowing
that
this
is,
at
bottom,
an
enumerated
powers
case,
not
a
tenth
amendment
case
in
any
specialized
sense,
because
the
washington
state
supreme
court
found
it
unobjectionable
that
section
409
would
apply
in
its
pre-1995
amendment
version,
and
what
that
indicates
is
that
there's
nothing
sacrosanct
about
state
courts'
procedures,
or
state
evidentiary
rules.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
agree
with
you
entirely,
justice
kennedy,
that
this
court
should
define
the
scope
of
the
statute
before
deciding
whether
or
not
it's
constitutional,
and
we
would
urge
the
united
states'
construction
of
the
statute.
i
would
say
that
the
waiver
question
is
somewhat
different.
i
don't
think
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
turns
on
the
waiver
question.
if
the
court
disagrees,
we
would
urge
the
court
first
to
find
that
this
privilege
is
not
waivable
at
least
in
gross
and,
second,
that
even
if
it
is
waivable,
the
statute
remains
constitutional.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
you
do
have
a
final
state
decision,
and
i
think
that's
most
clear
with
respect
to
the
pda
action...
that's
the
state
public
disclosure
act
that
was
brought...
because
in
that
case
the
washington
supreme
court
held
that
the
four
documents
were
disclosable
and
said
that
attorney's
fees
would
be
appropriate.
in
this--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
but
there
was
no
cross-appeal
on
that
document
either,
justice
scalia,
so
i
think
that
document
is
no
longer
part
of
the
case.
when
the
washington
court
of
appeals
held
that
four
of
the
five
documents
needed
to
be
disclosed,
pierce
county
took
an
appeal
to
the
washington
state
supreme
court,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
guillens
filed
a
cross-appeal
suggesting
that
the
fifth
document
ought
to
be
disclosed,
and
so
i
really
think
the
fifth
document
is
no
longer
in
the
case,
and
since
the
washington
supreme
court
found
that
attorney's
fees
were
appropriate,
that
means
that
there
was
a
final
judgment.
that's
true
both
at
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
not
how
i
read
the
decision,
justice
ginsburg.
i
thought...
i
read
the
decision
as
the
four
documents
were
clearly
going
to
be
disclosed
as
part
of
the
pda
action.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
not,
with
respect,
how
i
read
the
opinion.
i
read
the
opinion
that
those
four
documents
are
disclosable
under
the
pda.
the
only
objection
to
disclosure
under
the
pda
that
was
raised
by
the
county
was
section
409,
and
with
that
issue
resolved
against
the
county,
i
took
the
import
of
the
decision
that
those
documents
would
be
disclosed.
at
that
point,
i
think
it's
clearly
a
final
decision,
because
this
court
has
held
in
the
beckton
dickinson
case
in
the
context
of
section
1291
that
the
fact
that
attorney's
fees
need
to
be
resolved
on
remand
doesn't
deprive
a
decision
of
finality,
and
in
that
decision
this
court
relied
on
1257
decisions,
and
so
i
would
think
that
the
same
rule
would
apply
in
both
contexts,
so
i
think
that
the
pda
action
clearly
is
final.
i
think
the
tort
action
is
a
more
difficult
question
as
to
whether
that's
final.
i
think
this
court
might
have
to
change
its...
to
modify
its
precedents
a
bit,
but
i
think
it
might
be
a
wise
course
in
light
of
what
congress
has
done
here.
i
think
this
case
is
quite
analogous
to
a
case
that
this
case
found
final
called
national
mercantile
bank
v.
langdow,
and
in
that
case
there
was
a
state
venue
provision
that
a
federal
statute
trumped,
and
the
state
supreme
court
found
that
the...
this
court
found
that
the
state's
decision
saying
that
state
law
trumped
the
federal
statute
was
final,
and
i
think
the
cases
are
quite
parallel.
they
both
involved
congressional
efforts
to
modify
state
procedure
in
order
to
serve
a
federal
interest,
and
in
both
cases
when
the
state
court
disregarded
the
federal
interest
and
either
through
constitutional
means
or
statutory
means
found
the
federal
statute
inapplicable,
this
court
found
that
there
was
a
final
judgment
in
the
langdow
case,
and
i
think
by
extension
of
that
decision,
they
could
find
a
final
judgment
here.
i
think
the
main
difference
between
this
case
and
langdow
is
that
in
langdow
this
court
took
the
position
that
upon
remand
there
would
be
no
further
litigation
available
in
the
state
court
where
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
here,
there
might
be
some
litigation
that
would
go
on
in
the
tort
action,
for
example,
but
i
think
the
important
thing
is
that
the
federal
interest
has
been
extinguished,
and
i
think
if
there's
any
play
in
the
joints
in
this
court's
finality
decisions,
i
think
that
this
would
be
a
particularly
important
case
to
find
a
final
decision,
because
an
act
of
congress
has
been
held
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
these
actions
are
severable.
they
were
consolidated
for
purposes
of
appeal
before
the
washington
supreme
court,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that
would
be
fair,
or
this
court
could
just
sort
of
ignore
the
tort
case
and
say
that
it's
going
to
take
jurisdiction
over
the
pda
action
and
decide
this
federal
statutory
issue
in
the
context
of
the
state
pda
action,
and
then--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
mean,
i
think
that
this
court
could
say
that
to
the
extent
that
the
tort
action
is
before
it,
that
that
action
is
not
final,
and
that...
or
they're
not
going
to...
the
court's
not
going
to
definitively
resolve
that,
and
that
the
pda
action
is
final.
i
would...
this
court
in
a
different
context
actually
managed
to
bifurcate
a
single
case
and
say
that
one
part
of
the
case
was
final
and
the
accounting
action
that
was
subject
to
remand
was
not
final.
that's
the
w.
w.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
no,
but
i
think
if
you
can
do
that
in
a
single
case,
i
think
you
can
certainly
do
it
in
a
case
like
this,
where
they
started
as
separate
actions,
were
consolidated
only
for
purposes
of
appeal,
and
really
have
separate
life.
if,
for
example,
this
court
hadn't
exercised
jurisdiction,
what
would
have
happened
is
that
the
two
cases
would
have
gone
back
down.
the
pda
action
would
have
been
essentially
over,
because
as
the
county
suggested,
there's
nothing
left
in
the
pda
action
on
remand.
the
tort
action
would
go
on,
and
once
the
pda
action
went
back
to
the
trial
court,
then
it
would
have
been
appropriate
to
appeal
that
on
a
separate
track
from
the
tort
action,
and
there
would
have
been
really
no
point
to
making
the
county
go
through
that
exercise,
and
so
i
think
the
pda
action
is
final.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
think
the
important
submission
from
the
government
is
that
the
1995
amendments
can
be
given
force
in
a
way
that
renders
them
still
quite
well
within
the
congress'
power
under
the
commerce,
spending,
and
necessary
and
proper
clauses.
