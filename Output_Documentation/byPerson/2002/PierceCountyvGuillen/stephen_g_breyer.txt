i'm
still
slightly
mixed
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
imagine
the
forest
service
in
the
state
collects,
because
they
have
tree
lovers,
a
piece
of
paper
that
says
the
elm
trees
at
the
intersection
of
such-and-such
were
diseased,
all
right.
now,
that's
done
for
purposes
of
tree
health,
and
there's
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
environmental
tree
section
which
has
that
written
right
on
it,
and
one
day
the
transportation
department
for
safety
reasons
says,
send
us
a
xerox
of
that,
okay.
the
question
i
think
justice
souter
was
asking
and
justice
scalia,
and
i
would
certainly
ask,
is,
in
your
view,
when
they
send
a
subpoena
or
discovery
to
the
tree
department
to
get
that
piece
of
paper,
can
they
get
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
very
well.
suppose
that
the
transportation
department
one
day
wrote
a
witness'
name
down,
an
address
which
they
got
from
the
internal
state
government
telephone
book.
in
your
opinion,
could
a
plaintiff
go
and
ask
for
a
telephone
book?
the
answer,
i
guess,
is
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
see
what
the
difference
would
be.
they
didn't
collect
the
telephone
book
for
purposes
of...
they
didn't
make
the
telephone
book
for
the
purposes
of
accidents,
but
one
day
somebody
went
to
the
telephone
book
and
copied
some
information
out
of
it
for
the
purpose
of
accidents--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
that's
why,
you
see,
exactly
why
i
find
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
rather
strained,
so
what
is
the
answer
to
what
my
hypothetical
suggests?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
said
that
they
could
not
get
the
piece
of
paper--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
the
tree
division--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
all
i'm
having
trouble
is
distinguishing
between
the
piece
of
paper
written
for
tree
health
and
the
address
in
the
telephone
book
written
so
people
can
know
where
people
should
be
phoned.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
intrastate?
if
you
simply
have
a...
if
you
interpret
the
statute
to
say,
a
document
that
is
prepared
primarily
for
this...
for
getting
money,
primarily
for
getting
money
out
of
the
federal
government
can't
be
discoverable
in
a
tort
action?
what
part
of
the
constitution
would
that
violate,
if
that's
how
you
interpret
it?
you'd
get
all
your
documents,
i
guess,
and
so
would
anyone
like
you,
but
that
seems
to
be
basically
what
the
government's
arguing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i...
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
certainly
right,
and
so
congress
says,
we
have
a
federal
interest
in
trying
to
minimize
accidents,
and
in
order
to
do
that,
we
want
to
get
information
from
the
states
when
they
want
our
money,
and
to
be
sure
the
information
is
accurate,
we
want
to
be
sure
that
at
least
the
information
they
give
us,
they're
collecting
with
an
eye
towards
being
accurate
rather
than
with
an
eye
towards
protecting
themselves
from
tort
litigation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
sounds
reasonable
to
me.
what's
unreasonable
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
didn't
read
it
that
way.
i
thought
what
they
were
saying
was
consistent
with
if
it...
and
maybe
it's
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
it
is,
but
i
mean,
if
you
ever
have
the
great
single
data
base,
you'd
look
to
see
whether
the
document
was
primarily
created
for
the
one
purpose
or
the
other.
where
it's
primarily
created
for
accident
reports,
you
get
it.
where
it's
primarily
created
to
get
money
from
the
government,
you
don't.
i
mean,
does
that
work
as
an
interpretation?
i'm
not
sure
we
have
to
reach
it,
but
if
we
did?
