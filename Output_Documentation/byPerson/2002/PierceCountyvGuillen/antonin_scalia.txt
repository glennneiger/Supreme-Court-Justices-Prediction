scalia
it
doesn't
say
documents.
i
mean,
you
quoted
it,
you
began
the
quote
after--
justice
antonin
scalia
--after
the
noun.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
noun
you
inserted
was
documents.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
says
data,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
didn't
say
he
could
get
the
document.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
you
could
depose
him--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
was
what
my
question
was
going
to
be.
are
you
drawing
a
distinction
between
getting
the
document
that
was
generated
in
the
environmental
agency
and
deposing
the
person
who
made
the
document?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
it
says
data.
i
don't
care
about
the
cases.
i
care
about
the
text
of
the
statute.
it's
data
whether
it's
in
a
document
or
whether
it's
in
some
deponent's
head.
data
is
data.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
what's
special
about
the...
this
is
just
an
assertion
that
the
federal
government
has
no
authority
to
do
what
it
has
done,
and
you
say
an
individual
who
has
been
harmed
by
the
federal
government's
exceeding
its
authority
does
not
have
standing
to
challenge?
it
seems
to
me
we
do
it
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
all
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
whenever
the
government
goes
beyond
its
enumerated
power,
it
is
infringing
upon
the
powers
of
the
states,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
tenth
amendment
says
is,
you
know,
other
than
the
enumerated
powers,
the
other
powers
continue
where
they
used
to
be,
with
the
states.
in
other
words,
i
don't
see
anything
special
about
a
tenth
amendment
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
a
final
state
decision
here,
mr.
clement?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
a
fifth
document,
though,
and
they
didn't...
there
was
no
appeal
on
that
one,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
need
to
find
finality
with
respect
to
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
i
don't
want
to
wrestle
with
the
complexities
of
the
tort
action,
what
would
we
do,
just
dismiss
that
case
as
improvidently
granted
and
decide
the
other
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
can't
ignore
it.
i
mean,
we've
taken
the
case.
we've
granted
certiorari.
we've
got
to
do
something
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
hide
it
under--
