every
fact,
so
that
if
the
department
of
environmental
protection
has
prepared
a
report
saying
the
accidents
are
wrecking
the
grass
and
the
flowers
at
an
intersection,
and
that
report
is
then
given
to
whatever
the
data
collection
agency
here
is
for
this
purpose,
that
all
of
that
data,
including
the
data
in
the
department
of
environmental
protection,
is
then
covered
by
the
privilege?
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
same
data
is
in
the
environmental
report.
that
data
is
then
given
to
the
collection
agency.
does
the
data,
even
in
the
hands
of
the
environmental
department,
become
subject
to
the
privilege
at
that
point,
on
your
reading?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
report.
i'm
talking
about
the
fact
which
is
reported.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
data
in
the
report.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
that...
does
that
data--
justice
david
h.
souter
--become
subject
to
the
privilege?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
your...
then
the
answer
to
my
question,
i
guess,
is
no,
the
data
does
not
become,
as
such,
subject
to
the
privilege.
it's
only
the
data
as
held
by
the
collection
agency.
you
can
still
go
to
the
environmental
department,
depose
them,
get
your
information?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
if
you
don't
have
to
depose
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
because
of
a
privilege,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
the
reason
for
that
is
the
police
said,
look,
we
don't
have
to
do
your
homework
for
you.
if
you
know
what
you
want,
we'll
give
it
to
you.
if
you
don't
know
what
you
want,
we
don't
have
to
search
for
it.
isn't
that
the
reason?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
in
the
past,
then,
and
in
accordance
with
justice
ginsburg's
question,
you
could
have
asked
for
the
police
report,
and
in
justice
breyer's
example,
i
presume
you
could
have
gone
to
the
tree
division
and
said,
let's
have
the
slip
of
paper
that
says
the
elm
trees
are
diseased.
now,
you
can't
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
justice
ginsburg's
question
is,
i
thought
it
was
supposed
to
leave
things,
as
it
were,
level,
the
way
they
were,
that
a
disadvantage
was
not
being
created,
it
was
simply,
the
intent
was
simply
to
avoid
creating
a
new
advantage
which
would
deter
the
state.
isn't
that
the
way
we
should
read
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
can
avoid--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
irrelevant
under
your
argument
that
the
object
of
the
federal
legislation
is
safety
in
an
artery
of
commerce?
is
that
beside
the
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
that
think
the
federal
interest
in
this
case
is
comparable
to
the
federal
interest
in
lopez,
the
ultimate
interest?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
ultimate
federal
interest
that
gives
rise
to
all
of
this
regulation,
which
is
the
safety
of
an
artery
of
commerce.
are
you
either
disputing
that
that
is
the
object,
or
are
you
saying
that
that
object
is
on
par
for
constitutional
purposes
with
the
significance
of
the
government's
object
in
lopez?
