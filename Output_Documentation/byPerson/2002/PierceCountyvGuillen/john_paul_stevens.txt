justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
telling
us
what's
wrong
with
the
other
reading.
which
is
your
reading?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
you,
if
i
may.
are
you
saying
that
the
lawyer
defending
the
county,
if
the
plaintiff
called
him
up
and
said,
i'd
like
to
see
these
reports,
and
the
lawyer
said,
well,
they're
privileged,
but
i
think
i'll
give
them
to
you
because
i
think
it's
in
everybody's
interests
to
know
the
facts,
that
would
violate
the
federal
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
asking
you
about
showing
them
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there's
only
one
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
sure
i
understood.
you
say
the
documents
that
you
requested
fell
within
category
1?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
they
were
documents
that
were
actually
prepared
to
get
highway
funds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
your
view,
none
of
the
documents
that
you're...
that
are
in
dispute
fall
within
category
1.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
could
that
be
if...
how
could
any
document
be
collected
for
the
purpose
of
participating
in
the
federal
program
if
the
state
doesn't
participate
in
the
federal
program?
