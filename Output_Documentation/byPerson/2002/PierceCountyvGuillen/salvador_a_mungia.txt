mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statute
does
have
to
be
construed,
but
regardless
of
how
the
statute's
construed,
it
clearly
does
not
meet
this
court's
requirements
under
south
dakota
v.
dole
because
409
is
not
conditional.
you
read
the
plain
language
of
409,
and
it's
not
conditional
in
nature.
it's
a
mandate,
and
if
somehow
it
could
be
construed
as
being
conditional,
it's
certainly
ambiguous,
as
we've
seen
many
interpretations
and
many
questions
as
to
the
operation
of
409.
409
cannot
be
justified
under
the
commerce
clause.
it
does
not
regulate
commercial
or
economic
activity.
instead,
it
regulates
state
courts,
and
that
is
the
peculiar
nature
of
this
dispute,
because
what
is
at
issue
is,
is
what
does
a
state...
this
is
completely
an
intrastate
concern.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
justice--
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
--justice
breyer,
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
we
still
get
our
documents,
and
i
do
want
to
make
it
clear
for
the
record,
and
i
think
it's
clear
in
the
briefs,
pierce
county
took
a
different
tack
on
this
and
had
a
very
wide
scope
of
interpretation.
however,
despite
that
fact,
there
still
has
to
be
authority
under
the
commerce
or
spending
clause,
and
i
may
not
get
it
in
this
issue
if
we
get
our
documents,
that's
correct,
but
i'm
saying
that
no
matter
what,
the
act
has
to
have
authority
under
some
article
i,
section
(a)
basis.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
justice--
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
--justice
breyer,
because
the
analysis
starts,
is
this
commercial
or
interstate
activity
that
in
fact
the
federal
government
is
regulating,
and
they're
not,
they're
regulating
state
courts.
and
again--
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
--that
is
the
disputable
part,
as
to
whether
or
not
there's
any
evidence
in,
within...
not
only
in
the
record,
or
anywhere
that
can
be
found,
whether
this
action,
indeed,
would
prevent
any
further
accidents.
all
the
statute
does--
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
--justice
ginsburg,
that
is
the
historic
and
that
is
the
correct
analysis.
this
court
has
been
very
deferential
to
congress',
even
if
there's
something
within
the
information
source
that
could
support
that
reasoning,
and
again
i'll
go
to
u.s.
v.
lopez
and
u.s.
v.
morrison
for
that
proposition,
where
in
u.s.
v.
lopez,
there
were
no
congressional
findings
at
least
this
court
alluded
to.
they
do
not
have
to
make
congressional
findings,
as
long
as
there's
something
out
there,
some
information,
and
the
same
thing
with
u.s.
v.
morrison.
even
when
congress
did
make
a
congressional
finding,
this
court
said
we're
not
going
to
necessarily
find
that
in
fact
they
had
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
justice
ginsburg,
no.
they
are
seeking
different
materials,
and
the
materials
we
sought
in
the
tort
action
were
much
broader
than
what
we
sought
in
the
public
disclosure
act,
and
the
materials...
i
do
want
to
say
this
as
far
as
that,
there
is
no
judgment
in
the
tort
action.
i
mean,
that
should
be
clear.
there
is
no
final
judgment.
this
is
a
discovery
order
that
was
taken
up
on
interlocutory
appeal.
now,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
final
judgment
in
the
pda
action
is
a
closer
question,
but
i
would
point
out
to
the
court,
page
114
of
the
washington
state
supreme
court's
opinion
that
you'll
find
at
appendix
a-114
directs
the
lower
courts
to
make
their
rulings
in
accord
with
the
court's
opinion,
and
did
not
simply
say
these
documents
either
are
or
are
not
discoverable,
and
thus
it
is
debatable
whether
or
not
there
is
a
final
judgment
even
in
the
public
disclosure
act
case.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
correct,
and
i
read
the
opinion
differently,
where
in
fact
we
do
get
those
documents,
and
i...
we
may
have
a
fight
back
at
the
trial
court
as
to
the
language
of
the
washington
state
supreme
court,
because
i
realize
in
its
opinion
it
said
that
those
would
normally
not
be
discoverable
under
the
pda,
but
then
you
have
to
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
documents.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
justice
kennedy,
the
documents
that
we
sought
under
the
pda,
even
under
the
narrowest
construction,
under
the
narrowest
construction,
we
get
the
documents,
just
on
a
statutory
construction
under
the
pda
request.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
correct.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
and
so
at
least
in
this
case,
this
court
need
not
address
the
constitutional
issues,
finding
no
final
judgment
in
the
tort
action
and,
in
fact,
a
narrow
construction
for
the
pda
action.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
of
our
interpretation,
which
is
a
very
narrow
construction
of
the
statute.
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
no,
i'm
sorry,
if
i--
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
--oh,
no,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
saying
we
would
get
those
documents
under
our
construction.
in
other
words,
they
do
not
fall
within
the
parameters
of
that
narrow
construction,
because
these
are
documents
that
in
fact
were
prepared
by
another
agency.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
correct,
under
the
pda
action,
that
is
correct,
not
the
tort
action
but
the
pda
action.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
no.
if
they
don't
fall
within
category
1...
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
if
they
fall
within
category
2,
yes,
they
would.
under
the
pda
action,
those
documents
would
fall
within--
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
--correct,
they
fall
within
category
2.
and
i
do
want
to
point
out
to
this
court
that,
in
fact,
pierce
county's
position,
and
it's
shown
in
the
record,
was
that
we
could
not
even
discover
the
names
of
witnesses
or
the
names
of
the
people
involved
in
the
accidents,
and
that's
surely
not
part
of
the
federal
highway
funding
data,
because
why
is
the
federal
government
concerned
with
the
names
of
the
people
involved
in
the
accidents,
and
i
think
this
is
a
concern
about
putting
documents,
if
you
will,
in
a
black
hole
and
allowing
certain
information
which
our
supreme
court
has
held
is
essential
to
the
proper
determination
of
these
claims,
based
upon
state
and
local
law.
they
are
essential
to
those
determinations
going
in,
and
now
no
longer
being
discoverable.
i
think
that
is
a
very
basic
concern
with
this
statute,
and
why
at
least
one
reason
it
should
take
a
narrow
construction,
or
at
the
very
widest,
the
construction
put
forward
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
i
do,
and
that
is
the
day,
if
it's
not
today,
that
this
court--
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
--justice
breyer,
as
far
as
interpreting
the
electronic
portion,
it
probably
is
a
reasonable
interpretation,
and
you're
right,
i
mean,
it's
not
part
of
this
case,
but
it
probably
will
have
to
be
faced
sooner
or
later.
going
back
to
the
scope,
again,
because
we
are
talking
about
the
interpretation
of
this,
pierce
county
took
the
position
they
were...
and
this
is
in
the
companion
witmer
case,
which
is
the
one...
there
was
a
companion
case
at
the
state
level,
where
private
highway
surveys
done
by,
i
believe
it
was
the
mcdonald's
and
the
chevron
company,
which
the
county
then
took
within
its
possession,
it
was
unwilling
to
disclose
because
under
409,
so
again
i
think
the
county's
position
was
a
very
broad
one,
that
anything
that
goes
in
within
their
possession
then
becomes
nondiscoverable
and
you
cannot
use
it,
which
i
think
is
a
completely
unreasonable
interpretation.
i
do
want
to
take
a
few
minutes
and
talk
about
the
spending
clause,
because
this
is
not
a
condition.
if
you
read
section
409,
the
plain
language
of
409,
it's
mandatory,
and
surely
when
congress
has
intended
to
use
its
spending
clause
powers,
i
think
especially
in
the
federal
highway
setting,
it's
been
very
clear.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
justice
o'connor,
i
agree.
i
don't
think
it's
a
condition
either.
whether
you
want
to
term
it
as
an
incentive
or
something
else...
they
term
it
as
a
mandate.
i
think
regardless
of
how
you
term
it,
then
it
cannot
be
authorized
under
the
spending
clause.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
under
the
spending
clause
analysis,
this
court
has
long
gone
through
through
pennhurst,
through
south
dakota
v.
dole,
and
just
recently
in
durham
v.
gorham,
it's
clear
that
the
conditions
have
to
be
spelled
out.
now,
this
is
clearly
some
sort
of
imposition,
and
if
it's
not
spending
clause,
then
they'd
have
to
have
it
under
the
commerce
clause
authority,
which
goes
under
another
analysis.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
it
can
turn
down
federal
money,
and
that's
the
interesting,
mr.
chief
justice,
about
409.
again,
just
reading
the
plain
language
of
409,
it
is
mandatory,
and
there's
no
provision...
even
if
you
cross-reference
to
152,
there's
nothing
which
puts
anybody
on
notice
about
how
this...
how
a
state
can
avoid
the
mandates
of
409.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that's
an
open
question,
and
i
don't
necessarily
agree
with
that.
i
think
you
have
to
read
the
plain
language,
and
it
seems
like
congress
is
saying
you
will
do
this.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
correct.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
because
if
you
read
section
152,
what
it
mandates
states
to
do
is
come
up
with
a
list
and
a
survey
of
hazardous
sites.
that's
all
it
says,
in
52(a),
that's
the
mandatory
part.
so
congress,
if
it
has
the
authority,
can
tell
the
states,
do
this
list.
now,
the
question,
that
begs
the
question
whether
or
not
congress
has
that
authority.
i
think
then
that's
when
you
have
to
turn
to
the
commerce--
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
--justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct.
i
think
if
you
read
the
plain
language,
152,
unlike
23
u.s.c.
131,
141,
159,
161,
where
it's
clear
that
congress
says
you
must
control
highway
billboard
signs
or
you
lose
10
percent
of
your
funding,
you
must
control
size
and
weights
of
vehicles
that
go
on
interstate
highways
or
you
lose
10
percent
of
your
funding.
those
are
all
clear.
in
fact,
in
the
dole
case,
under
23
u.s.c.
158,
i
think
that
the
title
of
the
act
was
withdrawal
of
federal
funds.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
justice
ginsburg,
i
have
two
responses.
one,
i
think
actually
this
court
addressed
that
same
sort
of
analysis
in
new
york
v.
u.s.,
where
the
solicitor
general
argued
that
because
new
york
officials
wanted
the
benefits
of
the
low-level
hazardous
waste
act,
therefore
it
cannot
later
challenge
certain
provisions
of
that
act,
and
this
court
rejected
that
argument.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
and
that
goes...
then
to
my
second
part
of
my
response
is,
and
i
think
it's
a
fundamental
part
of
the
constitutional
analysis,
because
here,
if
the
states
wanted
this
protection
they
had
the
means
to
do
it
themselves,
and
this
court
has
explained,
again
citing
from
new
york
v.
u.s.,
state
sovereignty
isn't
for
the
benefit
of
the
states,
it's
for
the
benefit
of
the
citizens
to
derive
the
benefits
of
liberty
from
the
division
of
separate
powers,
so
it
really,
just
because
state
officials
want
it,
it's
clearly
that
the
people
of
the
state
of
washington
did
not
want
this,
because
it
infringed
upon
a
state
cause
of
action.
in
fact,
so
much
so
that
the
state
supreme
court
was
willing
to
hold
it
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
i...
justice
kennedy,
you
look
at
the
language,
and
in
fact
you
look
at
the
early
responses
by
pierce
county,
where
pierce
county
clearly
said,
we
cannot...
i
mean,
we
must...
we
don't
have
that
choice.
we
cannot--
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
--and
justice
kennedy--
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
--yes,
and
i...
justice
kennedy,
my
response
is,
i
don't
see
how
the
state
could,
because
i
think
just
for
the
very
reasons,
as
was
pointed
out
by
the
solicitor
general,
where
do
you
cross
that
line
between,
i
guess,
a
single
waiver,
and
then
it
becoming
endemic.
i
think
that's
the
whole
problem
here.
under
the
recent
cases
under
the
commerce
clause,
and
again
i
just
want
to
spend
a
couple
of
minutes
on
the
u.s.
v.
lopez
and
morrison
cases,
it
seems
clear
that
again
this
type
of
activity,
what's
being
regulated
is,
in
fact,
state
courts,
in
fact,
the
admissibility,
the
discovery
of
evidence,
and
that
is
certainly
intrastate,
and
there's
no
contention
here
that
somehow
justice,
or
the
discovery
of
documents
is
somehow
commercial
in
nature,
and
you
cannot
make
that
argument,
so
i
think
there
is
no
basis
under
either
the
spending
or
the
commerce
clause
to
support
this
legislation.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
justice
souter,
the
object
at
least
for
the
federal
highway
act
is
safety.
i
don't
think
the
same
thing
can
be
said
about
409,
because
then
you're
becoming...
as
this
court
said
in
u.s.
v.
lopez,
you're
building
inference
upon
inference,
because
you
have
to
go
and
say,
if
these
documents
are
no
longer,
in
fact,
discoverable,
would
it
result
in
safer
interstate
travel,
and
there's
just
too
many
intermediate
steps.
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
i
think
that
the...
justice
souter,
the
federal
interest
in
section
409--
mr.
salvador
a.
mungia
--justice
souter,
i
think
it's
more
the
latter.
i'm
saying
that
the
federal
government
certainly
has
an
interest
in
the
safe
passage
of
interstate--
