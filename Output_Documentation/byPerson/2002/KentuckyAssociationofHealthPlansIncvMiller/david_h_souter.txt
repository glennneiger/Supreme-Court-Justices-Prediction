justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
policy
term
that
is
changed
in...
in
the
literal
sense
of
a
change
in
language,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does
mean
that
under
a
policy
subject
to
a
law
like
kentucky's,
the
person
who
joins
the
hmo,
in
effect
the
person
who
obtains
the
insurance,
has
a
far
greater
choice,
in...
in
effect,
in...
in
the
expenditure
of
benefits
under
that
policy
than
he
otherwise
has.
he's
getting
something
under
a
policy
subject
to
the
connecticut
law...
the
kentucky
law,
that
he
does
not
get
under
a
policy
without
that
law,
and
that
is
a
breadth
of
choice
about
who
is
going
to
treat
him.
justice
david
h.
souter
well...
well,
sure,
but
i
mean,
the
point
of
the
statute
and
the
point
of
the
case
is
that
providers
do
elect,
and
to
the
extent
that
they
elect,
the...
the
person
subject
to
the
policy
has
a
choice
that
is
a...
a
breadth
of
options
that
otherwise
are
not
going
to
be
available.
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
nobody...
nobody
can
seriously
deny,
on
the
common
sense
criterion,
that
a
person
who
gets
hmo
coverage...
whether
it's
subject
to
a
law
like
kentucky's,
is
getting
a
far
greater
choice,
potentially
and,
i
presume,
actually,
since
you're
here,
than
a
person
who
signs
up
for
an
hmo
without
the
choice
guaranteed.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
a
common
sense
way,
someone
is
getting
a
different
kind
of
coverage,
i.e.,
a
breadth
of
choice
under
the
medical
coverage,
that
otherwise
wouldn't
be
available.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
considered
by
itself,
if...
if
you
simply
narrow
to
the
provider
subcategory
of
pharmacists,
i...
i
assume
you're
right,
but
if
you
look
at
the...
at
the
broad
category
that
is
covered
by
this
statute,
there
is
one,
i
think,
significant
difference
between
this
and
the...
and
the
limited
to
pharmacy
coverage
in
royal
drug.
i
think
the
difference
is
this.
pharmacy
coverage
basically
is...
is
coverage
for...
for
benefits
that
are
fungible
regardless
of
where
you
get
them.
the
super-aspirin,
the
industrial
strength
motrin
is
going
to
be
the
same
no
matter
what
drug
store
you
get
it
from.
medical
coverage,
however,
is
not.
it
is
really
important
to
patients
to...
to
choose
a
doctor
because
of
the
personal
relationship,
and
therefore,
i
don't
see
the...
the
precedential
force
of
royal
drug
in...
in
a
physician
coverage;
a...
a
physician
option
kind
of
case
like
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the...
the
patient,
in
fact,
is...
is
given
in
practical
terms
a
breadth
of
option.
it's
true
the
patient
can't
force
a
doctor
to
sign
up
with
the
hmo
or
force
the
hmo
to
take
on
a
particular
doctor,
but
in
practical
terms,
there
are
going
to
be
more
doctors
available
under
a
kentucky
kind
of
regime,
and
in
that
sense,
the
patient
is
given
a
breadth
of
options
that
otherwise
wouldn't
be
available.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
important
when
one
is
selecting
physician
coverage
in
a
way
that
is
not
important
when
one
is
selecting
drug
store
coverage.
justice
david
h.
souter
absolutely...
absolutely
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
of
course,
the...
the
criteria,
the
way
we
refer
to
that
criterion
under
the
mccarran-walter
trio
is...
is
not
in
terms
strictly
of
legal
right,
though
that
will
satisfy
it.
we
ask
whether
it's
integral
to
the
policy
relationship,
and
i
suppose
something
can
be
integral...
integral
to
the
policy
relationship
even
though
it
is
not
expressed
literally
in
terms
of
policy
language
which
grounds
a
conventional
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
no...
no
question
that
that
certainly
is
a...
an
example
of
something
that
is
integral.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
would
suppose
that
the
difference
in...
in
the
kind
of
policy
choices
that
we've
been
talking
about
would
be
regarded
as
a...
by
a
potential
hmo
subscriber
as...
as
integral
to
what
he
is
purchasing
when
he
signs
up
with...
with
one
hmo
rather
than
another.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
you're...
you're
saying
the
first
mccarran-ferguson
factor
includes
a
provision
that
determines
the
way
the
insurer
manages
the
risk,
even
though
it
may
not
affect
the
risk
as
between
the
insurer
and
the
insured.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
thought
that
was
the
argument
you
were
making
right
then
and
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
one
reason,
i
suppose,
is
the
presumption
against
preemption
which
we
are
trying
to
maintain
in
erisa.
