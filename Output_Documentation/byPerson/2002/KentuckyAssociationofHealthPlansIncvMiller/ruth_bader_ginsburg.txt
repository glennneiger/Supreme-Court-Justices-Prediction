i...
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
the
any
willing
provider
statutes
have
been
around
now
for
sometime.
i
understand
the
case
that
you're
making
in
its
most
dramatic
is,
this
spells
the
end
of
hmo's,
because
the
whole
thing
works
only
if
they
have
few
doctors
and
lots
of
patients,
so
the
doctors
have
a
guaranteed
patient
flow.
has
that
happened
in
states
with
any
willing
provider
laws,
that
there
are
so
many
doctors
who
are
coming
in
that
the
doctors
who
were
in
in
the
beginning
now
say,
the
rates
have
to
go
way,
way
up,
because
we
don't
have
any
guaranteed
patient
flow
any
more?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
whole
distinction
that
here
the
direct
beneficiary
is
the
provider?
that
is,
the
effect
of
the
any
willing
provider
law
has
opened
the
door
to
the
provider,
whereas
in
rush
and
in
ward,
it
was
the
insured
himself
or
herself?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is...
is
there
anything
more
than
that
that...
here,
the
patient
is
the
indirect
beneficiary
of
opening
the
door
to
the
provider.
in
those
two
cases,
it
was
the
insured.
there...
there
was
no
third
party
involved.
it
was
just
the
insurer
and
the
insured.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
not
true
in
either--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ward
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
you
characterize
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you...
you
don't
like
the
label,
insurance.
would
you
call
it
a
health
care
law?
you
said
it's
not
an...
an
insurance
law--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's...
they
could
just
as
well
have
been
in
something
labeled,
health
code.
this
is
not
like...
i
mean,
things
that
regulate
risk,
you'd
say,
oh
yeah,
i'm
going
to
find
that
in
the
insurance
code--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
here,
wouldn't
it
have
been...
suppose
the
law
had
been
written
to
say
that
no
doctor
can
join
a
closed
plan.
it
would
be
the
same
thing,
wouldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
would
be
the
equivalent
of
disbarment.
a
doctor,
a
rule,
a
regulation
of
the
medical
profession
is,
doctor,
you
cannot
join
a
closed
plan.
it
seems
to
me
that
would
accomplish
the
very
same
thing,
but
it
would
be
in
their
health
code.
unlike
some
things...
it
can't
be
that
everything
that
the
insurance
commissioner
does
is
therefore
regulating
insurance
within
the
meaning
of
this
legislation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
may
i
ask
a
follow-up
question,
then?
if
the
whole
difference,
then,
is
this,
quote,
common
sense
test--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'll
tell
you
frankly
what
my
problem
is.
i
read
the
sixth
circuit
opinion,
i
said,
yes,
that
makes
common
sense,
and
i
read
judge
kennedy's
dissenting
opinion
and
said,
yes,
that's
common
sense,
too,
so
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
these...
these
are
rational
judges
on
both
sides,
they
both
made
good
arguments,
and
they
both
conformed
to
some
sense
of
what
goes
on
in
the
real
world,
so
what
is
the
common
sense
test?
