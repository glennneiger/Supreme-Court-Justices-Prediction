now,
i
take
it
these
laws
have
become
fairly
common--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--around
the
country,
so
kentucky's
not
alone
in
having
such
a
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
for
instance,
here,
if
it's
chiropractic
services,
and
let's
assume
the
hmo
did
not
previously
include
chiropractic
physicians
as
providers,
after
this
law,
if
a
chiropractic
physician
in
good
standing
were
willing
to
come
in
under
the
hmo,
then
the
hmo
would
have
to
take
that
physician,
and
then
the...
the
patient
would
have
a
possibility,
at
least,
of
having
paid
services
seeing
a
chiropractor
that
formerly
would
not
have
been
available.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
well,
why...
why
is
what
i
said
different
from
what
happens
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you're
complaining
about
the...
the
increase
in
the
number
of
providers,
and
it's
that
increase
that
is
what
might
be
desirable
from
the
patient's
standpoint.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
how
does
it
spread
the
risk,
actually?
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
that
it
does
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i...
i
don't
see
how
that
spreads
the
risk.
i
understand
you
think
there's
a
practical
benefit
to
the
insureds--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
how
does
it
spread
the
risk,
please?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
we
ever--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--analyzed
a
case
that
way
in
solving
these
problems?
have
we
ever
relied
on
that
difference
in
language,
mr.
feldman?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
regulation
of
insurance
versus
regulating
the
business
of
insurance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
