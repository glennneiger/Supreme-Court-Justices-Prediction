mr.
robert
n.
eccles
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
congress
enacted
erisa,
it
created
a
federal
regulatory
structure
for
employers
and
unions
to
sponsor
plans
that
provide
health
care
benefits
for
employees
and
their
families.
the
vast
majority
of
erisa
plans
throughout
the
country
have
chosen
to
provide
these
benefits
through
hmo's
or
other
managed
care
entities
that
use
limited
provider
networks
in
order
to
deliver
quality
health
care
at
a
reasonable
cost.
the
kentucky
laws
before
the
court
today
preclude
that
use
of
limited
provider
networks
and
require
an
hmo,
and
by
using
that
term
i
mean
to
encompass
a
variety
of
managed
care
arrangements,
require
those
arrangements
to
allow
into
the
network
any
provider
willing
to
accept
the
network
terms.
because
erisa
saves
from
preemption
state
laws
which
regulate
insurance,
the
question
here
is
whether
these
any
willing
provider,
or
awp
laws,
regulate
insurance.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
kentucky
has
a
relatively
broad
law,
your
honor.
many
of
the
laws
are
pharmacy
solely,
but
they...
kentucky
is
not
alone,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
no.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
there
are...
there
are
different
laws
about
that.
the
kentucky
law
by
itself,
in
the
definition
of
provider,
includes
a
variety
of
specialties,
including
chiropractor,
and
there's
a
separate
chiropractor
any
willing
provider
law
also,
but
the
question
here
is
whether
that
law
regulates
insurance,
and
last
term,
in
rush
prudential
versus
moran,
the
court
said
that
a
law
regulates
insurance
when
insurers
are
regulated
with
respect
to
insurance
practices.
awp
laws
do
not
regulate
insurance
practices.
they
do
not
affect
the
risk
of
financial
loss
that's
transferred
by
the
hmo
policy,
they
do
not
change
the
terms
of
the
policy
at
all,
and
they
do
not
change
the
bargain
between
the
insurer
and
the
insured.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
they...
they
change
the
network,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they...
through
a...
they
potentially
change
the
network.
the
law
itself
creates
no
change.
if
the
provider
elects
to
join
the
network,
and
is
willing
to
accept
the
terms--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--no,
your
honor.
it...
it
gives
the
patient
no
right
he
would
otherwise
not
have.
if
you
look
at
the
exemplar
policy
that's
in
exhibit
c
to
the
joint
appendix,
you
will
see
nothing
that's
changed
in
the
policy
terms.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
the
choice,
you
know,
exists
if
the
provider
elects
to
join
the
network,
and
it's
entirely--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--potentially.
in
a--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--not...
the
policy
does
not
change
in
that
way,
justice
scalia.
what...
what
the
policy
says--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--no...
no,
it
does
not,
and
the
reason
is,
what
the
policy
provides
is,
we
will
pay
for
care
from
participating
physicians,
from
network
providers,
and
that
is
still
the
policy.
the...
before,
with
or
without
the
awp
law.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
it...
it
has
taken
away
the
hmo's
ability
to
select,
that's
correct--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--but
the
definition
of
who...
it
is
still
limited
to
participating
physicians
who
meet
its
own--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--but
the...
before
or
after
the
awp
law,
the
participant
has
no
right
to
choose
any
particular
provider.
the
participant
has
the
right
to
use
the
network
physicians
under
the
terms
in
the
policy.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
after
the
awp
law,
if
a
provider
joins
the
network,
the
participant
still
has
exactly
the
same
right.
the
network
has
a
different
composition.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
under
that
hypothetical,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
you
know,
if
that's--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--well,
we
don't
know
the
effect
of
the
law
on
the
networks--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--that...
that
would
be
a
significantly
different
law,
justice
o'connor,
and
for
this
reason.
in
that
case,
which
is
generally
referred
to
as
a
mandatory
provider
law,
it's
very
much
like
the
mandatory
benefit
laws
that
this
court
has
held
to
be
saved.
that
changes
the
legal
rights
to
get...
of
the
insured
to
get
that
type
of
care,
and
it
changes
the
risk
under
the
policy.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
because
the
terms
of
the...
the
network
would
already
provide
for
chiropractors.
the
only
question
is
how
many
would
come
in.
this
law
would
not
regulate
that.
that's
regulated
through
other
aspects
of
kentucky
law.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
but
the...
the
bargain
in
that
circumstance,
if
it...
if
it
works
out
that
way,
she...
she
is
able
to
stay
with
the
doctor,
but
under...
only
if
the
doctor
can
get
into
the
network,
and
is
willing
to
meet
the
terms
of
the
network.
it's
entirely
up
to
the
doctor
to
come
in.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
because
the...
the
change
is
the
legal
right
of
the
insured,
which
was
never
to
any
particular
provider,
and
that's
still
true
after
the...
the
law.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
i...
i
think
the
difference
between
that
hypothetical
and...
and
mine
is,
the...
the
standard
with
or
without
the
law
is
still,
if
the
provider
comes
into
the
network,
and
you
have
the
right
to
the
network
provider,
and
that's
all.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
we
believe
that
the
law
interferes--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--yes,
it
couldn't,
your
honor,
it
precludes
the
plans
from
limited
networks,
and
what
that
does,
and
this
is
the
point
made
by
the
ftc
staff,
which
has
been
writing
states
objecting
to
these
laws,
is
it
creates
an
uncertainty
in
the
network,
because
the
bargain
that's
been
made,
the
noninsurance
bargain
between
the
hmo
and
the
providers
is,
it's
altered,
although
the
policy
is
not,
and...
and
suddenly,
the
providers
who
are
in
the
network
already,
they...
they
signed
up
for
a
different
deal,
which
was
a
limited
network.
they
may
not
want
the
deal
they've
got,
because
they'll
have
less
patient
volume
than
they
thought
they
were
getting.
it
also
adds
significantly
just
administrative
costs
to
deal
with
more
providers,
and
it's
also
more
difficult
to
monitor
quality
with
a
larger
network,
so
it
does
have...
it's
the
uncertainty
of
what
the
law's
effect
will
be
that--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--well,
we're
really
complaining
about
the
uncertainty
that's
created,
that
the
networks
can
no
longer
be
selective,
which
has
quality
and
cost
implications,
including
fee
implications.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
i...
i
can't
tell
you
about
the
number
of
doctors,
justice
ginsburg.
the
studies
that
are
in...
cited
in,
particularly
in
the
amicus
briefs,
suggest
that
there's
been
about
a
15
percent
increase
in
cost
arising
out
of--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--i...
i'm
not
sure
they
could
do
it
in...
in
that
avenue,
through
medicare
or
medicaid.
the
federal
government
could
obviously
do
it
directly
with
its
own
law
on
the
books,
which
would--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
i...
i
don't
think
it
would
do
the--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--right.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
right.
what
is
relevant
is
whether,
as
the
court
said
in
moran
last
term,
these
are
insurance
practices,
and
the
court's--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--the--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--that...
that's
certainly
a
major
part
of
our
distinction,
justice
ginsberg.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
the...
the
patient,
i
would
say,
is
a
potential
beneficiary,
but
without
rehashing
that,
those
two
cases,
a
legal
right
was
created
for
the
insured.
in
ward,
the
court
said
that
was
a
mandatory
contract
term
that
had
been
added
by
using
the
notice-prejudice
rule,
and
rush
added
the
option
of
seeking
external
review
and
those...
and
described
it
as
a
legal
right
enforceable
against
the
hmo.
here,
there
is
no
such
legal
right,
and
we
believe
that
in
order
to
be
an
insurance
practice
under
this
court's
precedents,
the
practice
must
either
affect
the
spreading
of
risk,
which
any
willing
provider
laws
do
not
do--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--that's
right.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
or,
as
in
ward
and
rush
prudential,
must
affect
the
legal
rights
of
the
insured.
the...
the
court
has
used
a
formulation
of
that
phrase
in...
in
many
of
its
savings
clause
decisions,
including
those
two.
we...
we
also
think
the
court
has
approached
this
through
a
common
sense
inquiry.
that's
how
it
begins
the
savings
clause
inquiry,
and
on
a
common
sense
basis,
nobody
contends
that
the
provider
contracts
themselves
are
insurance
contracts,
and
nobody
contends
that
the
providers
are
part
of
the
business
of
insurance.
instead--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--but--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--i...
i
think
the
common
sense
approach
can
be
viewed
by
looking
at
this
court's
decision
in
royal
drug,
and
particularly
if
you
look
at
the
factual
parallels
with
this
case.
if
the
kentucky
statute,
the
general
any
willing
provider
statute
can
be
disaggregated
into
a
bunch
of
separate
statutes,
each
about
a
different
provider,
that
the
term,
provider,
includes
podiatrists,
physicians,
optometrists,
and
pharmacists,
so
we
have
here
effectively
one
part
of
the
statute
is
an
any
willing
pharmacy
statute,
that's
functionally
indistinguishable
from
the
statute
that
was
before
the
case
in
royal
drug.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
but
under
the
kentucky
law,
the
patient
has
no
right
to
choose
the
family
doctor.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
i...
i
understand
the
point,
justice
souter,
although
the...
the
option
and
the...
the
preference
don't
match
up
perfectly.
even
if
there
is
a
broader
range
of
options,
they
don't
necessarily
include
a
doctor
with
whom
the
patient
has
a
prior
relationship.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
but
returning
to
the
pharmacy,
it's
true
that
the
aspirin
is
all
the
same
wherever
you
go,
but
the...
the
agreements
at
issue
in
royal
drug,
besides
giving
the
benefits
of
pure
convenience,
the
ability
to
get
the
drug
at
the
corner
drug
store,
which
is
not
nothing,
also
gave
a
very
important
financial
advantage
if
you...
if
your
pharmacy
were
participating,
and--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
effect
that
the
agreements
that
were
being
regulated
in
blue...
with
blue
shield
and
royal
drug,
the
court
held
were
not
part
of
insurance.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
and
we
have
functionally
the
same
type
of
agreements
here,
an
agreement
between
the
hmo
and
the
pharmacy
or
other
provider,
and
they
also
should
not
be
part
of
insurance.
they're...
they're
outside
the
insurance
relationship,
and...
but
it
was
important...
i
want
to
make
this
point,
important
potentially
to
the
patients,
the
insureds
in
royal
drug,
that...
that
their
pharmacy
became
a...
a
participating
pharmacy.
it
was
not
inconsequential.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
besides
convenience,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
example
in
the
court's
opinion
was
taken
from
the
brief
of
the
united
states
as
amicus.
they
posited
a
10-dollar
drug
at
retail,
and
if
you
got
it
at
a
participating
pharmacy
it
cost
$2,
if
you
got
it
at
a
nonparticipating
pharmacy
it
cost
100
percent
more,
or
$4.
presumably
those
numbers
are
indexed
since
1979
now,
and...
and
greater,
but
it
was
of
great
interest
to
the
insured
whether
the
pharmacy
was
participating
or
not.
it
made
a
large
cost
difference,
and
yet
the
court
said
it
is
not
insurance
in
part
because
it
was
not
affecting,
was
not
integral
to,
was
not
changing
the
legal
rights
of
the
insured-insurer
relationship.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
that's
argued
in
the
briefs
that
it...
that
it
makes
a
difference,
and
we
understand
it's
an
antitrust
case.
we...
we
still
think
besides
the
direct,
factual
parallel
with
the
fact
that
kentucky
has
an
any
willing
pharmacy
statute,
that
royal
drug
is
still
the
correct
analysis
for...
it
gives
the
correct
analysis
as
to
the
mccarran-ferguson
factors
really
for
two
reasons.
one
is,
that's
what
this
court
has
applied
consistently
in
its
savings
clause
case...
cases.
it...
it...
this
court
said
in
the
first
savings
clause
case,
metropolitan
life
versus
massachusetts,
that
the
royal
drug
analysis
was
directly
relevant
to
the
erisa
savings
clause,
so
it
has
the
virtue
of
familiarity
and
precedent,
and
the...
the
standards,
the
mccarran
factors
make
sense
here.
they're
objective
factors
that
give
some
content
to
the
subjective
test,
the
common
sense
test.
but
the...
the
second
piece
of...
of
the
many
attacks
that
have
been
made
on
the...
the
relevance
of
royal
drugs
in
the
brief
is,
it...
it's
argued
in
the
brief
that
this
court
in
fabe
took
a
broader
view,
looked
to
a
different
clause
of
mccarran-ferguson
and
said
it's
broader,
that
insurance
regulation
can
be
a
little
broader,
and
it's
geared
to
protect
the
performance
of
the
contract,
and
we
don't
shy
away
from
that.
the
any
willing
provider
laws
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
performance
of
the
hmo
policy
here.
they
just
do
not
add
to
that
policy
at
all.
it's
argued
in
the
briefs
through
hypothetical
examples
that
they
are
effectively
kentucky's
regulation
of
hmo's,
the
adequacy
of
the
networks
and
so
on,
and
we
are
accused
of
wanting
to
undo
all
regulation
of
hmo's.
that's
not
our
position
here.
the
line
we
would
draw
would
preserve
most
of
the
state's
regulation
of
hmo's,
but
these
laws
are
not
laws
that
are
substantive
regulation
of
insurance,
the
awp
laws.
they
are
not
adequacy
laws.
they
are
not
continuity
of
care
laws.
kentucky
has
laws
like
that
on
its
books.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
i
would
characterize
them
as
a
law
that
gives
a
right
to
a
provider
and
makes
it
difficult
for
hmo's
and
erisa
plans,
but
gives
nothing
of
enforceable
right
to
the
insurers.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
it...
it
might
be
considered
a
health
care
law,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct,
and
in
that
case,
it
would
not
come
within
the
savings
clause,
but
it's
a
law
that
regulates
the
contracts
between
the
providers
and
the
hmo's.
now,
just
to
go
back
slightly
over
what
i
just
said,
we
are
not
here
challenging
the
basic
concept
of
state
regulation
of
hmo's.
where
we
think
the
court
has
drawn
the
line,
and
where
we
would
urge
that
it
continue
to
draw
the
line,
is
to
say
that
a
law
regulates
insurance
if
it
affects
risk-spreading,
which
this
does
not.
the
risk
here
is
the
risk
of
financial
loss
from
needing
medical
care.
erisa
actually
has
a
helpful
definition
that
makes
that
clear.
the
definition
of
an
employee
welfare
benefit
plan,
which
is
the
kind
of
plan
we're
dealing
with
here,
is
a
plan
that
provides
benefits
for
medical,
surgical,
or
hospital
care,
or
benefits
in
the
event
of
sickness.
that's
the
risk.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
but
it
regulates
only
the
noninsurance
relationships,
justice
kennedy.
it...
it's
exactly
what
the
court
held
was
not
insurance
in
royal
drug.
they're
external
to
the
insurance
relationship,
and
they
don't
change
the
insurance
relationship
at
all.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
that's
absolutely
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance,
and
that's--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--well,
what--
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
--sure.
the
distinction
is,
our
test
is,
effect
the
transfer
of
the
risk,
and
in
that
case,
there
is
suddenly
a
new
covered
risk,
the
risk
of
needing
mental
health
care
is
covered
by
the
policy
and,
if
that's
not
at
issue,
and
the
court
has
had
recent
decisions
where
it
has
not
analyzed
risk-spreading,
found
it
unnecessary,
it's
always
looked
at
the
second
mccarran
factor.
it's
always
considered,
you
know,
whether
the
legal
rights
of
the
insured
are
being
regulated
here,
are
being
protected
by
the
state
regulation
in
the
insurer-insured
relationship,
and
in
that
mandated
benefit
case,
they're
clearly
getting
a
new
legal
right
which
they
do
not
have
under
any
willing
provider.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
that's...
in
a
colloquial
sense,
of
course,
if
all
these
things
fall
into
play.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
if
all
these
eventualities
fall
into
place
and
you
do
have
a
broader
choice,
that's
obviously,
in
a
colloquial
sense,
of
some
benefit,
but
it's
not
what
benefit
means
under,
and
insurance
means
under
the
court's
savings
clause
process.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
that...
that's
correct,
justice
souter,
it
is
phrased
in
terms
of,
integral
to
the
relationship.
however,
when
the
court
has
described
that
factor
in
pilot
life,
in
unum
versus
ward,
and
rush
prudential,
it's
used
terms,
rush
prudential,
a
legal
right
to
the
insured
enforceable
against
the
hmo.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
right.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
our
point...
in
pilot
life,
the
court
described
the
second
factor
as
not
satisfied
because
the,
you
know,
the
cause
of
action
does
not
define
the
terms
of
the
relationship,
and
we
would
say,
you
know,
that
has
not...
does
not
occur,
either,
under
any
willing
provider.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
n.
eccles
i'll
address
four
points,
if
i
may.
first,
as
to
the
argument
that
a
condition
is
removed
in
the
policy
by
operation
of
kentucky
law,
that's
not
true.
before
and
after
the
kentucky
law,
the
condition
on
getting
payment
from
a...
from
a
participating
physician
is
identical.
all
that's
changed
is
that
outside
network.
the
law,
just
so
i'm
clear,
does
not,
by
itself,
require
a
network
to
admit
a
chiropractor
when
it
has
no
chiropractic
coverage.
that's
a
different
law.
if
it
did
that,
we
would
say
that
definitely
affects
the
legal
rights
of
the
insured
and
would
be
a
mandated
benefit
law
such
as
the
court
sustained.
second
point,
we
are
not...
a
comment
was
made
by
counsel
for
the
commissioner
about
regulations
of
providers
providing
benefits
to
the
insurers.
some
do,
and
those...
the
line
we
would
draw,
say,
if
it's
a
regulation
of
a
provider
such
as
a
continuity
of
care,
such
as
a
hold
harmless
provision
that
prevents
the
provider
from
billing
for
the
balance
above
the
network
rate,
that
clearly
affects
the
legal
rights
of
the
insured,
and
would
be
saved
under
our
test.
third,
royal
drug,
it's
this
court's
precedents
that
have
said
the
royal
drug
analysis
is
directly
relevant
to
the
erisa
savings
clause.
it
was
the
dissent
in
royal
drug
who
said
that
pharmacy
agreement
is
integral
to
the
relationship.
you
can't
have
it
without...
you
can't
have
the
insurance
without
the
pharmacy
agreement,
but
that
was
said
in
the
dissent.
the
court
rejected
that
view,
and
who
is
in
the
participating
network
is
not
part
of
the
benefit
of
the
insured.
the
insured
just
has
no
right
to
decide
what
doctor
to
go
to,
or
any
legal
right.
to
address...
fourth
and
finally,
to
address
perhaps
more
concisely
the
question
of
why
do
we
care,
if
this
isn't
going
to
expand
the
networks,
it's...
it
hurts
us
even
if
the
network
doesn't
expand
in
the
slightest
because
if
nothing
changes,
if
no
choices
or
options
are
expanded,
the
uncertainty
that
has
resulted
is
added
to
the
administrative
cost.
it's
affected
the
ability
to
be
selective.
you
have
these
networks--
