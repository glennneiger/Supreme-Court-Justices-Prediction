g.

if
that's
so,
i
mean,
since...
i'm
not
sure
of
the
relevance
of
this,
but
i
mean,
if
it
turned
out
that
this
law
or
others
like
it
drove
up
costs
for
no
advantages,
couldn't
the
federal
government
stop
them
by...
under
medicare
and
medicaid,
wouldn't
they
have
enough
power,
or
would
they,
to
simply
write
regulations
such
that
they
won't
reimburse
states
for...
if
these
circumstances
were
quite
bad?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
require
an
act
of
congress.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to...
you
think
they
don't
have
the
authority?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
anyway,
as
far
as
the
harm
is
concerned,
a)
we
don't
know
that
there's
any
harm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
b)
we
don't
know
that
the
government
could
deal
with
it
in
some
other
way,
and
so
it's
pretty
much
irrelevant
to
our
decision,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
we're
back
at
justice
scalia's
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
an
antitrust
case,
then.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
think
maybe
that
makes
a
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you...
what
about
metropolitan
life?
what
about...
you
have
a...
you
have
a
contract
the
state
says...
i
would
have
thought
the
harder
thing,
which
i
don't
think
any
more,
is,
is...
is
an
hmo
an
insurer.
we
went
over
that
in
that
other
case,
rush,
and
it's
quite
clear
that
40
states
regulate
them
as
insurers,
so
we
know
they're
insurers.
now,
if
any
state
tells
an
insurer,
mr.
insurance
company,
when
you
write
that
contract,
you
have
to
put
in
it
mental
health
benefits,
isn't
that...
that's
part
of
the
business
of
insurance,
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
here
what
they're
saying
is,
you
have
to
put
in,
use
any
physician
benefits.
i
mean,
it's
the
same
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we...
how
do
you
get
out
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
also,
i
guess
if
you
were
taking
the
view
that
the
language
business
of
insurance
could
mean
different
things
for
purposes
of
section
2(b)
of
mccarran-ferguson
in
here,
you'd
find
support
for
that
in
royal
drug
itself,
isn't
it,
which
said
that
maybe
the
meaning
of
those
words
in
2(a)
and
2(b),
although
they're
the
same
words,
is
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
doesn't
spread
the
risk.
it
doesn't.
i
mean,
it
just
doesn't,
does
it?
i
mean,
it's
simply
an
ordinary...
it's...
what
it's
a
regulation
of
is,
if
the
risk
eventuates,
the
insurer
has
to
carry
out
his
side
of
the
bargain
in
this
particular
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
regulation
of
the
goods
or
services
that
an
insurer
provides.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
you're
going
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
is
to
say,
it
doesn't
spread
the
risk,
so
if
the
other
case
means
you
have
to
have
a
risk,
then
you
lose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
doesn't...
i
thought
that
that
other
case
has...
since
it
involves
the
provision
by
an
insurer
of
goods
and
services,
and
a
regulation
of
how,
when
the
risk
eventuates,
it
is
pretty
similar,
and
so
the
difference
is,
what
they
say
in
footnote
18,
i
guess,
which
is
probably
what
was
going
on
here,
which
is
that
we're
interpreting
not
the
mccarran
act's
effort
to
allow
states
to
regulate
insurance.
we
are
interpreting
what
they
call
the
secondary
purpose,
and
that
purpose
was
to
impose
a
narrow...
narrower
limitation
on
the
reach
of
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
that
the
key
distinction,
or
is
there
another
one,
too?
