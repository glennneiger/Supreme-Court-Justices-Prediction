chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
00-1471,
the
kentucky
association
of
health
plans
versus
janie
a.
miller.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they...
they
do
have
something
to
say
about
who's
going
to
be
available
as
a
doctor
on
the
plan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
that...
that
really
does
not
seem
to
make
sense
to
me.
the
purchaser
has
the
same
right,
in
theory,
certainly
to
go
to
any
physician
in
the
network,
but
the
hmo
has
been
required
to
expand
the
network.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
hypothetical
about
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
before
the
law,
the
network
could
have
refused
him
categorically,
even
though
he
were
willing
to
meet
the
terms.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
hear
you,
i
just
don't
see
that...
that
you...
you
make
much
headway
in
saying
that
isn't
a
change.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
just
as
a
matter
of
convenience?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
eccles.
mr....
ms.
johnson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
johnson.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
feldman,
what
would
be
an
example
of
a
measure
which
did
spread
the
risk,
as
that
term
was
referred
to
in
royal
drug?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
name
of
the
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
if
the
risk
were
tied...
the
risk
is
that
the
patient
becomes
ill
and
needs--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--medical
care,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so...
so
how...
how
does
this
measure
spread
the
risk,
or
why
does
it
not
spread
the
risk?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it's
just
common
sense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
would
be
ridiculous
to
reach
it,
since
the
three
factors
are
what
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
eccles,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
eccles.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
00-1471
will
be
anoounced
by
justice
scalia,
the
kentuchy
healthcare
plan.
