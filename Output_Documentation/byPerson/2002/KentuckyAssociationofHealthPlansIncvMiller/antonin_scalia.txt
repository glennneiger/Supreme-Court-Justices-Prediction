justice

even...
not
potentially.
i
mean,
even...
even
if
nobody
elected...
even
if
nobody
elected
to
join,
what
has
happened
by
reason
of
this
law,
is
it
not
the
case
that
the
term
of
the
policy
is
changed,
that
originally
the
policy
said,
we
will
pay
for
your
treatment
by
a
limited
number
of
individuals
whom...
whom
we...
whom
we
approve,
and
that
policy
is
now
changed
to,
by
reason
of
this
law,
we
will
pay
for
your
treatment
by
any
individuals
who
want
to
join
our
plan.
isn't...
isn't
that
a
different
policy?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
rewritten,
but
doesn't
the
law
have
that
effect,
to...
to
effectively
change
the
term
of
the
policy?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
to
use
your
term,
physicians,
before
the
law,
is
defined
as
those
physicians
whom
we
are
willing
to
accept
as
part
of
the
plan,
and
after
the
law,
the
definition
of
participating
physician
is
any
physician
who
wants
to
join
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
you...
you're
really
asserting
that...
that
two
insurance
policies
are
exactly
the
same,
their
terms
haven't
changed,
or
their
terms
aren't
different,
where
one
says
you
can
get
your
automobile
fixed,
we
will
pay
to
get
your
automobile
fixed
by
these
companies,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
and
the
other
one
says,
we
will
pay
to
get
your
automobile
fixed
by
any
company
that
is
willing
to
do
the
job
up
to
our
standards,
and...
and
you
think
those
two
insurance
policies
are
saying
exactly
the
same
thing,
that
there's
only
a
hypothetical
difference
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
would...
i
would
be
sympathetic
to
your
case...
i...
i
keep
bumping
up
against
the
royal
drug
case,
where
it
seems
to
me
all
of
the
practical
things
you
say
about
this
case
could
have
been
said
there.
the...
the
contract
really
is...
is
altered,
the
contract
of
the
insured.
under
one
situation,
he
has
to
go
to
a
certain
drugstore,
under
another
situation
he
has
his
choice
of
drugstores
which
may
provide
lower
cost.
even
if
it
doesn't
provide
lower
cost,
it's
a
great
convenience
to
be
able
to
go
around
the...
around
the
corner,
and
yet
we
said
that,
you
know,
limiting
the
number
of
drugstores
with
whom
the
insured
could
deal
did
not
affect
the
business
of
insurance.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it
is
factually.
i
don't
care
about
factually.
tell
me
why
it's
legally
distinguishable.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
wait.
you...
you
want
us
to
abandon
the...
the
proposition
that
what
constitutes
the
business
of
insurance
is
the
same
under...
under
the
antitrust
laws
as
it
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
it
is
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
you
want
us
to
abandon
that,
then...
then
what
you've
just
said
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
the
same
analysis
does
not
apply.
you're
saying
that
the
mccarran-ferguson
criteria
do
not
necessarily
apply
to
erisa.
i
mean,
maybe
they
shouldn't,
but
that's
certainly
new
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
are
relevant
but
not
required?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
very...
the
very
factor
that
qualifies
as...
the
very
same
factor.
let's
assume
that
they
were
factually
the
same.
the
very
same
factor
that
qualifies
as
part
of
the
business
of
insurance
in
our
antitrust
analysis
could
nonetheless
qualify
as
not
business
of
insurance
under
erisa,
is
that...
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
vice
versa
means
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
just
answer
yes
or
no
to
what
i
just
said.
i
think
you
got...
i
think
you...
i
think
you
want
to
say
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
take
the
very
same
factor,
like
the
exclusion
of
certain
pharmacies,
which...
which
was
the
case
in
royal
drug.
that
very
same
factor
could
constitute
the
business
of
insurance
under
erisa,
and
yet
not
constitute
the
business
of
insurance
under
the
antitrust
laws,
because
we're
applying
a
different
test,
a
common
sense
test.
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes
or
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
in
the
erisa
case
there
is,
in
the
antitrust
case
there
isn't.
i
mean,
that's
what
makes
antitrust
different
from
erisa,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
they
both
focus
on
the
very
same
factor,
the
provision
of...
the
ability
of
the
insured
to
select
pharmacists.
now,
you
say
that
that
could
be
the
business
of
insurance
for
erisa,
and
yet
could
not
be
the
business
of
insurance
in
antitrust
cases.
yes
or
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i
think
that's
the
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
the
right
answer.
i
mean,
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
for
you
it's
the
right
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
not
sure
it's
the
right
answer
for
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
what
the
court
said
though,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
royal
drug
says
that
the
spreading
of
risk
is
an
indispensable
characteristic
of
insurance.
it
then
holds
that
the
pharmacy
agreements
do
not
involve
any
underwriting
or
spreading
of
risk.
now,
why
aren't
those
two
propositions
as...
as
true
here
as
they
were
in
royal
drug,
that
the
spreading
of
risk
is
the
essence
of...
of
insurance,
and
that
an
agreement
between
the
provider
of
the
goods
or
services
and
the
insurance
company
is
not
part
of
the
spreading
of
risk?
i
mean,
maybe
royal
drug
is
wrong,
but
i...
i
don't
see...
i
don't
see
how
you...
how
you
get
out
of
that
box.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
like
the,
you
know,
common
sense
test,
i
know
it
when
i
see
it.
what
i
worry
about,
the...
the
common
sense
test
is
that
we
will
approve
those
things
that
we
like,
and
disapprove
those
things
that
we
don't
like.
i
mean,
who
likes
a
private
antitrust
arrangement
that...
that
limits
choice,
so
you
just
say,
common
sense,
that's
not
the
business
of
insurance,
and
who
doesn't
like
something
that
enables...
enables
the
insureds
to...
to
have
a
greater
selection
in...
in
doctors,
so
we
say,
common
sense
says,
that
is
the
business
of
insurance.
i...
i
don't
trust
common
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
want
some
rule
of
law
that...
that
i
can
adhere
to.
i
thought
we
had
one
in
royal
drug,
and
i...
i'm
just
not
persuaded
about
why
insurance
is
one
thing
there,
and
it's
something
else
here.
i
mean,
if...
if,
indeed,
the
spreading
of
risk
is
what
insurance
is
about,
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
all
very
sophisticated,
but
i...
it
just
seems
to
me
that
what
constitutes
the...
insurance
in
one...
in
one
situation
ought
to
constitute
insurance
in
another,
and
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
just
common
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
what...
and
what
we're
doing
when
we...
when
we
deny
it
is...
is
exercising
policy
judgments
about
whether
we
think
the...
the
particular
thing
that's
been
done
is
desirable
or
not
desirable.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
don't
think
that
the...
that
under
erisa
it's
important
that
what
is
regulated
is
the
business
of
insurance?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
so
you
think
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
business
of
insurance.
it...
it
could
be
other
aspects
of
the
insurance...
of
the
insurance
company?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
like
what
buildings
the
insurance
companies
have
to
be
in,
and
other
things?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
once
you
depart
from
the
business
of...
the
business
of
insurance
concept
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
line
of
cases,
it
seems
to
me,
was
essential
to
make
sense
of
it,
and
it's
just
as
essential
to
make
sense
of
the
erisa
prescription,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
--have
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
kentucky
association
of
health
plan
versus
miller
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorar
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
petitioners
are
health
maintenance
organizations
that
maintain
exclusive
provider
networks
with
selected
doctors,
hospitals,
and
other
healthcare
providers.
the
advantage
of
these
exclusive
arrangements
according
to
petitioners
is
that
the
participating
providers
are
willing
to
provide
their
services
at
a
lower
price
in
exchange
for
the
increased
volume
that
the
exclusive
arrangement
assures
them.
kentucky
however,
does
not
like
the
insurers
preventing
people
from
going
to
their
own
doctors,
and
so
has
enacted
two
so-called
any
willing
provider
statutes,
which
prohibit
a
health
insurer
from
discriminating
against
any
provider
who
is
willing
to
meet
the
terms
and
conditions
for
participation
established
by
the
insurer.
there
are
similar
statutes
in
other
states.
petitioners
file
this
suit
against
respondent
the
commissioner
of
kentucky’s
department
of
insurance
asserting
that
the
awp
laws
are
preempted
by
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974,
commonly
known
feared
as
erisa.
erisa
preempts
all
state
laws,
"in
so
far
as
they
relate
to
any
employee
benefit
plan",
but
in
section
1144(b)(2)(a)
saves
from
preemption
“laws
which
regulate
insurance”.
the
court
of
appeals
sixth
circuit
concluded
that
each
of
these
laws
regulates
insurance
and
is
therefore
safe
from
preemption
by
1144(b)(2)(a).
we
affirmed.
in
our
view
kentucky’s
awp
statutes
are
laws
which
regulate
insurance
within
the
meaning
off
1144(b)(2)(a).
our
precedents
such
as
pilot
life
insurance
versus
the
dedeaux
established
that
to
come
within
this
provision,
state
laws
must
be
specifically
directed
towards
the
the
insurance
industry,
that
is
to
say
laws
of
general
application
that
simply
affect
insurers
as
they
do
everybody
else,
do
not
qualify
as
laws
that
regulate
insurance.
although
petitioners
contend
that
the
awp
laws
are
not
specifically
directed
toward
the
insurance
industry,
we
disagree.
neither
of
these
statutes
by
its
terms
imposes
any
prohibitions
or
requirements
on
providers
who
may
still
enter
exclusive
networks
with
insurers
who
conduct
business
outside
the
common
wealth
or
who
are
otherwise
not
covered
by
awp
laws.
the
statutes
are
transgressed
only
when
a
health
insurer
or
a
health
benefit
plan
that
includes
chiropractic
benefits
excludes
from
its
network
a
provider
who
is
willing
and
able
to
meet
its
terms.
also,
unavailing
in
our
view,
is
petitioner’s
contention
that
kentucky’s
awp
laws
fall
outside
1144(b)(2)(a)
because
they
do
not
regulate
an
insurance
practice,
but
rather
focus
upon
the
relationship
between
an
insurer
and
third
party
providers.
petitioners
rely
on
group
life
&
health
insurance
versus
royal
drug,
which
held
that
third
party
provider
arrangements
between
insurers
and
pharmacies
were
not
the
business
of
insurance
under
section
2(b)
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
erisa's
savings
clause
however
is
not
concerned
as
is
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
provision
with
how
to
characterize
conduct
undertaken
by
private
actors,
but
rather
with
how
to
characterize
state
laws
in
regard
to
what
they
regulate.
kentucky’s
laws
regulate
insurance
by
imposing
conditions
on
the
right
to
engage
in
the
business
of
insurance,
to
come
within
erisa's
savings
clause,
those
conditons
must
also
substantially
affect
the
risk
pulling
arrangement
between
the
insurer
and
the
insured,
kentucky’s
awp
statutes
pass
this
test,
we
think
by
altering
the
scope
of
permissible
bargains
between
insurers
and
insureds
in
a
manner
similar
to
the
laws
we
upheld
in
metropolitan
life
insurance
versus
massachusetts,
unum
life
insurance
company
versus
ward,
and
rush
prudential
versus
moran.
the
court's
decision
is
unanimous.
