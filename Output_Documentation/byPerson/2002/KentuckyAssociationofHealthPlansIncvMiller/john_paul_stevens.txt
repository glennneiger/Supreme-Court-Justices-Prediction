but
isn't
that
a
change
in
the
policy?
doesn't
it
give
the
patient
a
right
he
otherwise
would
not
have?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
i
don't
understand
is,
if
your
view
is
correct,
why
are
you
objecting
to
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
have
any
impact
on
your
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
another
difference
is,
there...
there
is
an
any
willing
provider
law
here.
there's
no
any
willing
provider
law
in
royal
drug.
there
was
a
private
arrangement
among
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--with
the...
the
blue
cross.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
not
consider
the...
the
benefit
of
having
the
selection
among
physicians
as
a
benefit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
say
it's
purely
financial.
as
long
as
you
pay
the
bills,
that's
the
only
thing
the
insurance
was
intended
to
cover.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
isn't
only
that.
i
think
the
statutory
language
refers
to
the
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance,
and
in
the
insurance
case
in
royal
drug
there
was
no
official
regulation,
only
private
regulation
of
the
agreement,
whereas
in
this
case
you
have
public
regulation,
so
it's
conceivable
that
here
you
have
regulation
of
insurance,
and
there
you
don't
count
a
private
agreement
as
the
kind
of
regulation
that
the
statute's
speaking
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
feldman,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
do
you
suppose,
if,
in
the
royal
drug
situation,
there
had
been
an
insurance
regulation
that
required
the
insurance
company
to
give
the
patient
an
option
between
generic
and
nongeneric
drugs,
that
that
would
have
been
the
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance?
