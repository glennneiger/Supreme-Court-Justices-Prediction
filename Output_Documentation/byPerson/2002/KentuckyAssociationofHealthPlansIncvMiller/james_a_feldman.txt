mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
think
one
example
would
in
metropolitan
life
against
massachusetts,
certainly
i
think
everybody...
i
understand
everybody
here
to
agree
that
a
law
that
required
an
insurance
policy
to
include
insurance
against
a
particular
risk
would
spread
the
risk,
but
i
think
what...
in
this
case
also
comes
right...
it
spreads
the
risk
at
least
for
purposes
of...
of
erisa
for
this
reason.
what
this
law
is,
is
a
condition
on
the
spreading
of
risk,
the
insurer
is
saying,
we
are
going
to
spread
the
risk
so
long
as
you
go
to
an
in-network
provider,
and
the
state
here
is
regulating
that
condition,
and
really
it's
analogous...
it
has
to
do
with
the
performance
of
the
risk-spreading.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it
does...
not
quite.
i
think
it
actually
does...
it
does
affect
that
risk,
but
i
think
it's
a
condition--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it's
a
condition
on
the
spreading
of
risk,
or
a
condition
on
the
performance
of
the
insurance
contract,
and
in
the
fabe
case,
which
was
a
mccarran-ferguson
act
case,
but
involved
a
different
provision
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
than
at
issue
in
royal
drug
and
the
pireno
case
that
followed
it--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
would...
i
guess...
for
you...
it
certainly
could
be...
i
think
semantically
it
could
be
said
to
just
increase
the
risk
in
just
that
way.
i
think
for
me,
i'm
more...
it's
more
comfortable
to
talk
about
a...
it
removes
a
condition
on
the
spreading
of
risk.
the
risk
would
be
spread
under...
without
this
law
so
long
as
you
go
to
a
provider
who
the
hmo
has
said
we're
going
to
let
into
our
network,
whereas
here--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
and
here
the
risk-spreading
is
so
long...
we're
going
to
spread
this...
such-and-such
a
risk,
but
so
long
as
you
go
to
any
willing
provider,
and
that's
a
different
condition.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that...
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
but...
but
it's
really
exactly
the
same
as
what
this
court
faced
in
fabe,
where--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--department
of
treasury
against
fabe.
in
that
case,
what
was
at
issue
was
a
priority
statute
about
how
to
distribute
the
assets
of
an
insurance
company
after
it
has
become
insolvent,
and
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
contract
as
to
what...
what
risks
the
insurer
was
going
to
insure,
but
what
the
court
said
is,
it
does
have
to
do
with
the
performance
of
that
contract,
because
if
the
assets
are
spread
in
a
certain
way,
the
insurer
will
actually
get
paid...
the
insured
will
actually
get
paid
if
that
risk
results,
and
otherwise
not.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
and
this
is
a
condition
on
that,
but
i
don't--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it...
it
operates
as
a
condition
on
the
spreading
of
risk,
because
without
this
law,
there--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
risk
will...
it's...
the
insurance
policy
says
we...
you...
we
will
spread
this
risk
among
all
our
insurers.
if
you
get
ill,
we're
going
to
pay
for
it
so
long
as
you
satisfy
a
certain
condition,
and
what
this
law
does
is,
it
alters
what
that
condition
is.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
but
the
court--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
and...
that
is
true,
and
the
court
repeated
that
in
royal
drug,
and
in
pireno,
and
in
fabe,
in
all
of
those
mccarran-ferguson
act
cases
it
made
exactly
that
point,
and
it--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
think
that's
the
most
important
one,
but
there's
a
number
that
are
related.
in
the
erisa
context,
for
example,
the
court
has
added...
the
court
said,
well,
we
first
look
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
at
the
insurance
policies.
it
didn't
just
say,
we
are
going
to
apply
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
to
erisa,
and
it
shouldn't
be
surprising
that
there
are
therefore
some
differences
between
the
two,
or
otherwise
it
would
have
been
unnecessary
for
the
court,
as
the
primary
test,
to
look
at
the
policy
as
a
whole.
second,
in
the
erisa
context,
the
court
has
specifically
said
that
not
all
three
factors
are
necessary
to
be
found
in
order
to
find
that
something
regulates
insurance.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
and
i...
i
don't
think
it
should
be
surprising
that
there
are
some
differences
between
erisa
and
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
not
only
because
of
the
policy
differences,
but
there's
a
noted
difference
in
language
between
what...
the
statute
that
the
court
was
construing
in
royal
drug
and
in
pireno,
and
with
the
one
it's
construing
here.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
erisa
just
says,
regulate
insurance.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
the
court
recognized
that
there
can
be
a
difference--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
but
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
it's
because
of
the
difference
in
language
that
the
court
from
metropolitan
life
on
has
adopted
a
different
analysis
in
erisa,
and
there's
actually
two
differences.
one
is
that
in
royal
drug
and
in
pireno,
which
involved
the
antitrust
exemption
that
has
to
be
narrowly
construed,
you
were
just
talking
about
a...
a
law
that
is...
that
is
in...
that
is...
the
business
of
insurance.
in
the
fabe
case,
which
involved
the
other
part
of
mccarran-ferguson,
which
saved
state
laws
in
the
areas
of
traditional,
in
the
area
of
traditional
state
regulation,
it
talks
about
regulating
the
business
of
insurance.
in
erisa,
you're
now
one
step
farther
away,
because
now
it
just
says,
regulate
insurance,
and
i
think
those
laws
are
differently
worded,
and
there's
every
reason
to
give
them
a
somewhat
different
scope.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
in
the...
i
think
the
court
in
the
pireno
case,
for...
oh,
the
difference
in
language?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
i
don't
think
the
court
has
relied
on
that
specific--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--language
in
any
of
its
cases
so
far,
because
most
of
the
cases
everything
has
lined
up
and
it
hasn't
had
to,
but
i
will
say
that
in
the
erisa
cases,
there's
now
a
couple
of
them
where
the
court
has
made
clear
that
all
three
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
actors...
factors
don't
have
to
be
applied
in
erisa,
and
the
court
has
never
reached
that
conclusion
under
the
antitrust
exemption
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
but
by
recognizing
that
they...
that
they're
not
all...
specifically
holding
that
they're
not
all
necessary
in
erisa,
i
think
the
court
again
recognized
that
there
can
be
a
divergence
in...
between
the
two
areas.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
and
i...
i
would
like
to
add
one
other
thing
about
the...
what's
been
called
the
common
sense
test,
which
is,
i
do
think
the
court
has
given
substantial
content
to
it
in
its
cases.
it
talks
about
a
regulation
that
homes
in
on
the
insurance
industry,
or
is
aimed
at
the
insurance
industry.
it
is
relevant
how
the
state
codified
it
because,
as
the
court
said
in...
as
recently
as
rush,
i
think,
the
term
insurance
acquires
its
coloration
and
meaning
from
state
law,
state
practice,
and
state
usage,
because
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
preserve
state
law
in
an
area
of
traditional
state
authority,
and
therefore,
the
codification
in
the
insurance
code
is
of
relevance.
and
finally,
at
the
very
least,
a
state
law
that
affects
the
contract
between
the
insured
and
the
insurer,
which
this
one
does,
has
a
necessary
effect
on
that
contract
and,
in
fact,
a
substantial
one.
that,
although
what
is
insurance
may
be
broader
than
that,
something
that
does
satisfy
that
i
think
clearly
is
insurance
under
the...
the
common
sense--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
it
probably
would
have
been,
and
i...
i
think
that
would,
of
course,
have
been
analyzed
under
the
other
half
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
if
it
was
a
state
regulation
of
that
sort.
that
concludes
my...
thank
you.
