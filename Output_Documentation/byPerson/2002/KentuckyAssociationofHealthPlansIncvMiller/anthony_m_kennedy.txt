m.

can...
can
kentucky
exclude
certain
specialties,
like
they
say,
we
will
not
have
chiropractors?
in...
in
kentucky,
can
the
plans
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
they
have
to
be
open
to
various
subspecialties?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in...
in
your
opening
remarks,
you
said
it
doesn't
change
the
bargain.
it
seems
to
me
the
thrust
of
justice
scalia
and
justice
souter's
questions
is,
it
does
exactly
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it...
it's...
maybe
i'm
under
a
misapprehension
as
to
how
the
bill...
i...
i
thought
that
the...
one
of
the
examples
given
in
the
brief
was,
a
woman
is
being
treated
during
the
term
of
her
pregnancy,
she
changes
her
employer,
she
wants
the
same
doctor
to...
to
treat
her,
and
she
is
the
one
that
can
initiate
the
request
to
the
hmo,
please
allow
this
doctor
to
treat
me,
and
the
doctor
then
says
yes,
i'm
willing
to
be
bound
by
the
terms
of
the
hmo,
and...
and
she
has
that
doctor.
that
seems
to
me
to
significantly
increase
the
bargain
that
she
made.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i...
i
recognize
that
we
have
the
risk-spreading
and
the
factors,
and
then
we
have
the
common
sense
test...
we
can
all
have
tests
floating
around
here.
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
this
just
does
regulate
insurance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
vice
versa.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how,
as
a
practical
matter,
does
it
affect
the
risk
here?
is
the...
is
the
risk
increased
for
the
insurance
company
under
this
law
because
it...
under...
under
the
kentucky
law
it
has
to
pay
for
chiropractic
services,
where
otherwise
it
would
not,
so
that's
an
increase
in
the
risk?
is
that...
is
that
your
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what...
that
was
going
to
be
my
second
question.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
risk-spreading.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
the
risk
is
a
condition,
is
a
health
condition
of
the
patient
that
will
be
covered.
