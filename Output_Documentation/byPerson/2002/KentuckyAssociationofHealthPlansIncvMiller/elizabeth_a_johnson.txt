ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
kentucky's
any
willing
provider
statutes
regulate
insurance
because
they
are
solely
directed
at
the
insurance
industry.
these
statutes
apply
only
to
kentucky
insurers
issuing
kentucky
health
benefit
plans.
petitioners
are
insurers
regulated
by
the
commissioner
of
insurance.
the
health
benefit
plans
that
they
offer
are
exclusively
regulated
by
the
commissioner
of
insurance.
these
statutes
are
located
in
subtitle
17a
of
the
kentucky
insurance
code.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
that's--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--if
that
law
was
not
in
the
insurance
code,
first
of
all
it
would
not
be
enforceable
by
commissioner
miller.
second
of
all,
insurers
are
the
only
entity
that
builds
networks
for
the
benefit
of
their
insured.
when
an
insurer
decides
to
offer
a
managed
care
plan,
they
tie
in
the
network
of
providers
to
the
benefit.
thus,
the
terms
in-network
benefit,
out-of-network
benefit.
therefore,
if
that
law
was
on
the
books
and
was
not
enforceable
against
the
insurer,
the
insurer
would
create
closed
panels,
and
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
have
any
doctors--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
but
this
court
has
found
that
relevant
to
the
inquiry,
and
the
fact
that
this
is
a
insurance
law
that
is
only
directed
toward
those
insurers
regulated
by
the
commissioner
of
insurance
is
very
important,
and
it
is
relevant,
and
the
fact
that
these
statutes
are
in
subtitle
17a
of
the
kentucky
insurance
code,
which
dictates
the
benefits
to
be
included
in
a
kentucky
health
benefit,
and
the
requirements
for
those
insurers
offering
those
plans.
the
common
sense
test
is
also
met
because
these
statutes
regulate
an
insurance
practice,
and
that
practice
is
the
practice
of
insurers
offering
managed
care
plans
to
contract
with
providers
for
the
benefit
of
their
insureds.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
your
honor,
royal--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--your
honor,
royal
drug
is
both
factually
and
legally
distinguishable
from
the
present
case.
first
of
all--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--well,
legally
distinguishable
is
that
you're...
in
royal
drug
you
were
looking
at
one
federal
statute.
in
the
present
case,
you're
looking
at
another.
in
royal
drug--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
i
believe
the--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--no,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
analysis
in
royal
drug
was...
was
appropriate
and...
and
accurate
for
an
antitrust
analysis
as
opposed
to
analysis
under
the
savings
clause,
which
this
court
has
said--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--no,
your
honor,
they
are
relevant,
as
this
court
has
said,
but
they
are
not
required,
and
in
this
court--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--in
this,
in
metropolitan
life
this
court
came
up
with
a...
a
broader
test
than
the
common
sense
test,
and
that
test
is
tested
by
the
mccarran-ferguson
factors
that
were
developed
in
royal
drug--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--but
they
are
not
required.
they
are
relevant.
they're
guideposts.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
in
an
erisa
case,
this
court
starts
with--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--the
common
sense
test,
and
under
the
common
sense
test
this
court
looks
at
whether
or
not--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--would
you
please
restate
your
question?
thank
you.
[laughter]
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
the
common
sense
test
controls
in
erisa
preemption
analysis.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
in
your
analysis
is
there
a
state
law
that
requires,
or
is
it
the
royal
drug--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--right.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
well,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
a
very
broad
test,
and
i...
i
think
it...
it's
looking
at
the
whole
picture,
and
the
fact
that
this
law
is
focused
on
regulated
insurers,
risk-bearing
entities
that
are
under
the
control
of
commissioner
miller,
and
it
regulates
their
insurance
practices.
20
years
ago
you
might
not
have
had
the
issue
where
providers...
that
insurers
were
contracting
with
providers
for
the
benefit
of
insurers,
but
that
is
a...
a
very
prevalent
practice
in
the
insurance
industry
today,
and
the
state
departments
of
insurance
regulate
that
practice,
and
in
kentucky
it's
heavily
regulated.
on
page
15
of
my
brief,
i...
i
set
forth
many
kentucky
statutes
that
regulate
the
insurer's
relationship
with
the
health
care
provider
for
the
benefit
of
the
insured.
these
statutes
were
also
set
forth
on
page
2
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
that
is
a
common
practice
in...
in
the
insurance
industry
today,
and
it's
a
heavily
regulated
practice.
the--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--it
is
different,
and...
your
honor,
and
in
royal
drug
was...
this
court
made
it
clear
that
they
were
trying
to
decide
whether
an
insurer's
practice
of
entering
into
provider
agreements
was...
constituted
the,
quote,
business
of
insurance
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
a
very
narrow
exemption
from
the
antitrust
liability.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
that's
true,
justice
stevens,
and
in--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--the
mccarran-ferguson
factors
are
also
met.
as
the
sixth
circuit
noted,
the
second
factor
is
clearly
met.
these
statutes
regulate
an
integral
part
of
the
policy
relationship
between
the
insurer
and
the
insured.
in
managed
care
plans,
provider
agreements
are
essential.
in
managed
care
plans,
and
under
kentucky
law,
certificates
of
coverage
cannot
exist
independently
from
the
provider
directory.
these
statutes
simply
prohibit
insurers
from
arbitrarily
limiting
the
number
of
providers
that
they
contract
with
for
the
benefit
of
their
insureds.
these
statutes
allow
insureds
greater
access
to
the
health
care
provider
of
their
choice,
and
i
think
this
is...
is
clearly
seen
in
krs
304-17a-505(1)(k),
which
requires
the
insurer
to
disclose
that
they
are
willing
to
contract
with
any
willing
provider.
this
simply
puts
more
control
to
the
insured
in
their
relationship
with
their
health
care
provider,
which
is
a
very
personal
and
unique
relationship.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
well,
again,
justice
scalia--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--your
honor,
the
sixth
circuit
did
find
that
kentucky's
any
willing
providers
transfer
or
spread
policyholder
risk.
as
the
sixth
circuit
noted,
these
statutes
open--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--justice
o'connor,
when
a...
when
an
insurer
sets
up
a
managed
care
plan
and
structures
their
benefits
to
be
in
a
managed
care
plan,
they
have
tied
in
the
network
of
providers
to
that
benefit,
and
when
you
have
a
statute
on
the
books
that
allows
the
insured
and
the
health
care
provider
greater
control
to
continue
a
relationship,
and
common
sense
tells
us
that
an...
an
insured
will
seek
an
out-of-network
provider
in
order
to
ensure
continuity
of
care
and
that
unique
relationship,
what
these
statutes
do
is,
they--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
--yes.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
johnson
it...
your
honor,
it
increases
the
risk
for
the
insurer
that
the
insured
will
not
have
to
seek
treatment
from
the
out-of-network
provider.
however,
as
this
court
has
noted,
all
three
mccarran-ferguson
factors
are
not
required
to
be
met.
this
court
reiterated
that
last
term
in
rush
prudential
versus
moran.
unless
there's
any
more
questions,
i
will
conclude
by
saying
that
kentucky's
any
willing
provider
statutes
are
laws
that
regulate
insurance,
and
therefore
are
saved
from
erisa
preemption.
thank
you.
