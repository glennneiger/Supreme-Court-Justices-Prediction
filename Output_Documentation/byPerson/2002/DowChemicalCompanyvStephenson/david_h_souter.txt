h.

but
were
they
plainly
included
within
the
class,
so
that
the
class
representatives
would
have
known
that
they
were
supposed
to
represent
these
people,
and
as
i
understand
it...
maybe
you
could
go
to...
go
to
this
point.
your...
your
friend
on
the
other
side
has
said,
the
first
time
that
in
writing
we
saw
anything
that
made
it
plain,
even
though
it
was
buried
in
language
somewhere,
that
the
injured
class
included
the
exposures
only
was
in
the
notice
of
settlement,
and
so
my
question
is,
is
that
correct,
and
number
2,
aside
from
that
point,
why
would,
why
should
we
understand
that
the
parties
involved,
including
the
representative
plaintiffs,
understood
that
injured
included
exposures
only,
so
that
they
knew
they
were
supposed
to
be
representing
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
there
are.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
were
symptomatic,
all
of
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
that's
get...
all
right,
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
gets
you
to
the
point
of...
of
the
settlement,
200,
whatever
it
was,
200
million
is
fine.
then
we
get
to
the
point
that
you
referred
to
a
moment
ago,
in
which
they'd
leave
it
to
the
judge
to
decide
how
the
200
million
is
going
to
be
split
up,
and
who's
in
effect
going
to
be
sub...
able
to
claim
benefits
out
of
what.
at
that
point,
i
suppose
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
symptomatic
class
representatives
are
going
to
be
in
favor
of
a
division
of
that
fund
which
gives
most
of
the
money
to
the
presently
symptomatic
veterans.
there
was
no
one
at
that
point,
that
i
can
see,
who
was
standing
up
for
the
as
yet
asymptomatics
and
saying,
wait
a
minute,
you're
not
setting
aside
enough
money
and
leaving
the
money
available
for
a
long
enough
period
of
time
for
us,
so
that
if
you're
right
up
to
the
point
of
settlement,
why
haven't
you
got
the
problem
once
that
point
is
reached?
justice
david
h.
souter
individual
veterans
were
heard,
but
they
weren't
representatives,
and
the
court
wasn't
a
representative.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
why
didn't
it?
why--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
i'm
posing
the
question,
as
at
the
point...
at
the
point
at
which
the
settlement
proceeds
are
being
divided,
as
between
those
who
will
get
something
and
those
who
will
get
nothing,
and
so
i'm
saying,
why
was
there
no
distinction
between
them,
for
our
purposes,
at
that
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
yes,
that's
true,
but
that
question
was
decided
before
in
respect
to
another
person.
now,
in
respect
to
that
other
person,
as
the
second
circuit
has
decided
it,
if
he
really
is
in
the
same
position
as
stephenson,
is
that
first
decision,
does
it
bear
the
weight
of
stare
decisis?
justice
david
h.
souter
stare
decisis,
though?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
gives
them
something,
but
not
more.
justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
say,
after
the
settlement,
do
you
mean
after
the
settlement
figure
was
announced
but
before
the
judge
made
the
division
of
proceeds
and
so
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
or--
justice
david
h.
souter
--after
the
judgment
was
entered?
