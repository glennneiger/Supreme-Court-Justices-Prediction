what
about
notice,
notice
to
these
respondents?
it's
sort
of
hard
to
find,
looking
back
at
the
settlement
agreement
and
the
orders
that
were
entered,
that
the
people
in
respondent's
category
were
thought
to
be
covered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
why...
why
was
none
of
the
money
held
over
for
such
late-blooming
claims?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
here,
so
may
i
ask
you
just
kind
of
a
preliminary
question
about
the
isaacson
case?
i
think
the
second
circuit
may
have
justified
federal
jurisdiction
over
that
case
under
the
all
writs
act,
and
i
think
this
court
recently
in
something
called
syngenta
said
that
wouldn't
fly.
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
isaacson,
remand
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
you
have
to.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
light
of
that
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
a
state
court
matter.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
these
points
were
made
in
prior
litigation
efforts,
maybe
not
by
mr.
stephenson,
but
these
points
were
litigated,
were
they
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
adequacy
of
representation,
and
notice,
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you're
saying
that
at
no
time
in
the
previous
reviews
of
this
judgment
was
adequacy
of
representation
dealt
with?
