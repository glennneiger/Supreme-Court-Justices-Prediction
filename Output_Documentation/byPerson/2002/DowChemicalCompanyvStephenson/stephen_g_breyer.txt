stephen

why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
suppose
i
agree
with
you
that
notice
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
the
second,
the
circuit,
second
circuit
has
a
footnote
where
they
say,
we're
not
deciding,
all
right,
so
we
have
to
assume
notice
is
adequate.
but
suppose
i
don't
agree
with
you
on
the
last
point.
suppose
i
can't
figure
out
a
reason
why
it
should
be
subject
to
some
special
standard
of
deference.
after
all,
this
person
is
claiming,
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
i
was
not
properly
represented.
if
i
don't
agree
with
you
about
that...
a)
why
should
i
agree
with
you
on
that?
b)
if
i
don't
agree
with
you
about
that,
still
the
second
circuit
said,
we're
looking
into
the
merits
of
this,
and
we
think
they
were
not
adequately
represented.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
to
know
whether
they're
right
or
wrong
about
that,
i
guess
i
have
to
read
500,000
pages
of
this
settlement
hearing
and
find
out
everything
about
this
case
in
order
to
decide
whether
they're
right
or
wrong--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--about
their
ultimate
judgement.
how
do
i
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
has
to
be...
i
think
the
answer
to
my
question
has
to
be,
is
just
tell
the
second
circuit,
wait,
amchem's
a
different
thing,
go
back
and
do
it
over.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
what
you're
saying
we
should
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
if
we...
if
i
reject
a),
if
i
reject--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
least
not
a
mass
tort
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
the
person
who
wants
to
settle,
you
know,
it's
always
open
to
any
one
of
a
million
people
in
the
action
to
come
in
later
and
say,
now
he
defines
himself
as
a
class
in
a
way
that
wasn't
represented
before,
not
too
hard
to
do,
and
he
says,
you
should
have
had
a
lawyer
for
that
group,
and
there's
just
nothing
anybody
can
do
about
it.
now,
that,
if
that's
so,
you
can't
settle
a
mass
tort
class
action,
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
i'm
putting
it
pretty
strongly,
but
i
want
to
get
your
response
to
that,
because
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that's
bothering
me
a
lot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
you
say,
that's
okay.
that's
not
such...
i'm
worried
about
it.
you
say,
don't
worry.
the
advisory
committee
says
you
shouldn't
settle
mass
torts.
they
all
should
go
to
trial
and,
fine...
i'm
a
little
hesitant
about
that,
considering
asbestos
is
eating
up
about
$200
billion
without
people
really
getting
compensated,
but
i
mean,
i'd
say
that
that's
a
possible
answer,
and
you
know
more
about
it
than
i
do,
i
should
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
a
case,
as
you
just
heard--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
as
you
know,
there
are
two
special
things
about
it.
one,
this
is
not
asbestos,
and
the
reason
it's
not
asbestos
is
because
asbestos
involves
future
claimants
whom
i
think
most
people
would
say
have
been
hurt
by
the
asbestos,
and
here,
there
are
future
claimants,
at
least
one
side
says,
have
not
been
hurt
by
agent
orange.
they
are
dying
naturally,
like
22
percent
of
us
will,
of
cancer,
and
they're
understandably
upset,
but
it
wasn't
agent
orange
that
did
it.
now,
that's
what
judge
weinstein
thought,
and
that's
why,
i
take
it,
he
felt
that
here,
unlike
asbestos,
you
don't
need
that
lawyer,
or
that
special
class.
now,
all
i
know
is,
that's...
this
is
the
third
time
that
question
has
been
raised
and
litigated.
the
first
two
times
it
was
decided
against
you.
are
we
supposed
to
sit
here,
knowing
virtually
nothing
about
it,
and
decide
whether
in
this
particular
case
that
was
right
or
wrong?
how
do
we
handle
this
case?
and
that's
why
they're
saying,
well,
what
you
should
do
is
give
some
weight
to
the
fact
that
this
was
already
decided
against
you
twice,
although
with
different
clients.
i'm
looking
for
an
answer.
i'm
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
not
trying
to
put
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--question.
i'm
trying
to
find
the
answer
to
how
we
deal
with
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
of
1984,
and
what
you're
saying
is,
it's
changed.
now,
is
that
change
relevant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
to
get
you
off
the
main
point.
i
was
very
interested
in
your
basic
answer,
so
continue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
the
adequacy
was
decided
in
two
separate
instances,
first
directly,
when...
i
think
it
was
ivy
and
somebody
out
of
texas
brought
the
same
kind
of
claim
that
you
have
brought
now,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
not
right,
because
i...
and
they
got
to
the
second
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
said
no,
you
people
were
represented
adequately,
and
that
was
similar.
then
i
thought
the
other
time,
which
is
not
directly
adequacy,
was
at
the
time
of
the
settlement
agreement
some
objectors
came
in,
and
they
raised
roughly
the
same
kinds
of
points
you're
raising
now,
and
there
judge
weinstein
said
that
the
settlement
was
fair,
and
then
it
went
to
the
second
circuit
and
they
said
it
was
fair,
despite
the
presence
of
that
objection.
that's
not
adequacy,
but
it's
raising
the
point
that
you
want
to
raise,
and
base
your
adequacy
argument
on.
so
those
are
the
two
things
that
i
thought
were
relevant.
now,
am
i
right,
basically,
in
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
texas
litigation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
ivy
in
the
same
position
as
stephenson?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
one...
and
suppose
i
agree
with
you
so
far.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
suppose,
for
argument,
and
i
say,
okay,
sure,
person,
claimant,
class
member
number
1,000,743
can
raise
for
the
fourteen
thousandth
time
class
representation
being
inadequate,
if
he
wants.
he's
probably
going
to
lose
because
of
stare
decisis,
but
he
can
do
it
if
he
wants.
now,
if
that's
the
analogy,
here,
i
would
say...
the
second
circuit
let
him
raise
it
and
then
said
he's
right,
but
the
reason
they
said
he's
right,
departing
from
their
prior
decisions,
is
because
of
our
amchem
and
ortiz
case.
now,
suppose
i
think
amchem
and
ortiz
don't
really
govern.
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
with
this
case,
send
it
back?
or
at
least,
they're
relevant
but
not
determinative.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
still
want
to
know
what
to
do
with
this
case.
i
mean,
what
do
i
do
with
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
he's
not
bound,
stephenson
isn't
bound
by
some
other
person
raising
that,
but
it's
stare
decisis,
like--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because?
