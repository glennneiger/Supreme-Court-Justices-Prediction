mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
isaacson
in
new
jersey
and
mr.
stephenson
in
louisiana
had
no
injuries
in
1984.
they
had
no
claim
that
they
could
have
brought
in
1984.
they
bring
the
claim
for
their
devastating
cancers
in
1998
and
1999,
when
they
can
under
their
state
law.
they...
the...
they
then
get
moved
to
dismiss,
because
others
have
somehow
settled
their
cases
without
them
ever
being
aware
of
it,
for
no
compensation,
and
told--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--mr.
isaacson's
here,
so
i
wanted
to
say
that,
but
i
think
we
do
a
remand.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
yes.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
in
light
of
syngenta,
yes.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
in
fact,
it
is
exactly
what
we
argued
at
the
time--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--when
it
was
being
removed.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
so
i
will
just
address
mr.--
stephenson
in
that
case.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
now,
mr.
stephenson
is
not
here
to
contest
whether
the
overall
settlement
is
fair
or
not.
that's
not
the
issue.
the
issue
here
is
whether
he
was
properly
before
the
court,
and
if
he
was
not
properly
before
the
court,
he
cannot
be
included
in
any
judgment.
that's...
that's
what
the
second
circuit
held,
and
the
question
then
becomes,
what's...
it
becomes
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
is
he...
in
order
to
bind
somebody
to
a
judgment,
they
have
to
have
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
in
the
class
action
setting,
we've
come
to
an
accommodation.
we
say
that
you
don't
have
to
personally
be
there,
but
if
you
have
notice,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
a
right
to
opt
out,
and
adequate
representation,
according
to
this
court
in
shutts,
then
we
will
say
that
you
are
deemed
to
have
been
there.
in
this
case,
mr.
stephenson
had
none
of
those,
and
let
me
tell
you
why.
to
begin
with,
we're
talking
about
the
question
of
representation
and
the
adequacy
of
representation.
at
the
time
this
class
was
certified,
there
were
no
representatives
selected,
not
a
representative
reviewed
for
anyone.
the
representatives
were
chosen
by
the
plaintiffs
after
the
court
was
certified,
after
the
notice
was
decided
on,
and
when
the
notice
was
going
out,
so
there
was
nobody
there
to
represent
anyone
at
the
time.
the
class
representatives
were
never
specifically
approved
by
the
court.
they
were
chosen
by
the
plaintiff's
counsel
for
the
purposes
of
trial.
all
the
class
representatives--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--1996
and
1998.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
well,
let's
say,
if
the
goal
is
the
ability
to
have
unexposed
people,
people
that
have
absolutely
no
disease,
to
somehow
take
care
of
them,
even
in
amchem
and
ortiz
there
were
certain
back-end
opt-out
rights
that
were
insufficient.
there
were
no
back-end
opt-out
rights
here,
so
one
of
the
things
the
court
would
have
to
do
is
to
give
some
kind
of
back-end
opt-out
rights.
it
would
have
to
have
some
kind
of
mechanism
to
take
care
of
information
that
came
as
a
result
of
science.
it's
an
interesting
phenomenon
that
most
cancers
don't
occur
until
more
than
20
years,
of
these
kinds,
afterwards.
in
actuality,
with
people
exposed
over
12
years,
the
present
claimants
probably
didn't
have
anything
related
to
agent
orange,
because
it
would
be
somewhat
later,
in
the
20
to
30
years,
that
they
would
actually
get
injured,
and
that
has
to
be
taken
care
of
if
you
want
to
look
at
futures.
there
also
has
to
be
some
kind
of
insurance,
some
kind
of
protective
mechanism
to
look
at
the
value
of
what
you're
getting
so
that
the
value
for
futures
in
comparative
dollars
is
equivalent.
there
are
a
lot
of
things--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--you
can
settle--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--i--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--well,
there's
multiple
questions
here.
one
is,
the
advisory
committee
in
1966
basically
said
it
was
inappropriate
for
mass
torts.
now,
if
you're
trying
to
make--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--i
would
think
that
if
there
is
a
question
on
how
you
can
do
it,
at
least
you
have
to
have
the
fundamentals
of
having
somebody
represent
those
individuals,
and
it's
a
person
so
that
a
lawyer
can
advocate.
if
you
have
an
individual
that
doesn't
have
an
injury,
at
least
you
have
an
advocate
for
that
individual,
and
he's
similarly
situated,
and
asking
for
the
same
relief
as
those
people
that
were...
that
he
wants
the
relief.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
somebody,
if
that
person
has
separate
counsel
advocating
for
them,
then
that's
the
first
thing
they
could
do
and
look
at
it.
i
mean,
is
it...
there
is
a
certain
difficulty--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--yes.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
well--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--i--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--i
understand.
you've
given
me
a
number
of
questions,
but
first
of
all,
the
first
question
was
never
decided
against
mr.
stephenson.
mr.
stephenson
never
had
an
opportunity
to
say
that
he
didn't
get
notice,
or
proper
notice,
and
it's
clearly
that
he
wouldn't
have
said
injured,
and
we've
talked
about
before,
the
actual
notice
that
went
out
said
it's
limited
to
people
who
have
injuries,
and
then
described
it
as
injury,
disease,
death
or
disability.
there
was
no
way
that
mr.
isaac...
that
mr.
stephenson
would
ever
have
thought
he
was
in
the
class
that
had
the
right
to
opt
out.
it's
also
true
in
this
matter
that
the
opt-out
period
ended
before
the
settlement
took
place,
so
there
was
never
an
opportunity
of
these
people,
of
the
uninjured
to
opt
out
of
the
class
and
have
the
rights
that
we
give
them
to
have
separate
litigation.
as
to
the
matter
of
the
science,
we
can...
we
can
speak
to
the,
you
know,
speak
to
the
science
itself.
it
has
changed
tremendously.
i
understand
that
your
honor
has
written...
has
written
on
this
in
a
footnote--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--i
think
the
change
is
absolutely
relevant,
because
the
possibility
of
the--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--the
change
in
the
science
has
been
dramatic,
and
i'll
just
say
very
briefly
that
in
1984
these
were
not
considered
human
carcinogens.
now
they're
recognized
as
human
carcinogens
by
the
international
agency,
the
research
on
cancer
by
the
epa,
and
it's...
the
national
academy
of
sciences,
so
our
scientific
understanding
is
utterly
changed
because
of
the
time
it
takes
to
do
those
kinds
of
scientific
types
of
proper
studies.
that's
what
has
to
be
taken
into
account
when
you
initially
go
about
having
a
settlement
and
thinking
about
futures,
and
that's
why
you
have
to
think
about
all
the
rights.
if
they
had
a
separate
advocate,
those
rights
would
have
all
been,
have
been
considered.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
certain
of
the--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--the
issue
of
adequacy,
and
the
issue
of
the
fact
that
there
was
never
any
advocates
chosen
does
not
appear
in
any
decision,
and
that
is
one
of
the
questions.
the
question
is,
what
does
mr.
stephenson
have
to
rely?
there's
not
a
designation
of
an
objector
that's
chosen.
we're...
we're
here--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--adequacy
was
dealt
with
writ
large,
and
i'll
separate...
there's
two
types
of
structural
adequacy
versus
prosecutorial
adequacy,
of
how
it's
prosecuted.
the
large
part
of
adequacy
was
discussed,
but
not
in
the
terms
that...
of
the
existence
of
any
specific
representatives,
and
as
i
said,
again
there
were
none
to
begin
with.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
well--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--theoretically,
justice
ginsburg,
but
in
reality,
justice,
judge
pratt
certified
the
class,
saying
he'd
find
adequate
representatives
in
the
future,
and
he
would
find
them.
when
judge
weinstein
certified
the
class,
there
was
still
no
representatives,
and
they
were
said...
he
asked
the
plaintiffs'
lawyers
to
find
them.
it
was
certified
without
any
single
representatives.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
there
were
certain
people,
there
was
one...
there
was
one
objector
in
the
record
who
was
a
very
informed
objector,
having
been
a
law
school
classmate
of
mr.
waxman.
he
did
raise
those
personally.
there
was
also
a
lawyer
that
raised
them
who
was
told
that
he
didn't
have
any
standing
to
raise
them,
and
there
was
a
question.
there
was
no
decision
that
describes
the
future,
the
issue
of
adequate--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--the
texas
litigation
took
place,
and
the
second
circuit
had
an
interesting
finding
there.
the
second
circuit
said
that
since
the
people
pre-1994
were
getting
the
same
compensation
as
the
original,
that
as
to
those
people
there
wasn't
any
difference,
because
they
were
eligible
for
the
same
compensation,
so
the
adequacy
decision
for
the
second
circuit
went
to
the
fact
that
the
result,
that
the
result
was
evenhanded
between
mr.
ivy
that
brought
the
case
and
the
present
representatives.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
no,
because
ivy
did...
was
eligible
for
money
from
the
settlement
funds.
the
settlement
funds
ran
out
in
1994.
that's
why
it's
different.
so
they
had
a
very
specific
holding
on
efficiency
in...
in...
before.
getting
back
to
my
other
point
on
prosecutorial
adequacy,
the
defend...
the
petitioners
would
ask
every
class
member
to
constantly
monitor
adequacy
to
make
sure
that
all
class
actions
are
adequately
handled,
when
they
say
you
can't
challenge
the
adequacy.
in
this
case
there
are
two...
there's
even
a...
there's...
in
prosecution
of
it,
in
not
having
ever
had
any
people
to
represent
the
futures,
after
the
settlement
was
finalized
in
199...
in
1988,
there
was
a
promise
in...
in...
in
the
fairness
notice
that
there
would
still
be
an
adjustment
made
if
there
were
future
scientific
findings.
nobody
ever
even
began
to
look
at
that,
because
there
was
no
representative
to
look
for
that.
also,
there
was
a
$10
million
reserve
fund
which
the...
which
the
defendants
demanded
in
case
of
state
court
action,
and
they
demanded
that
reserve
fund,
which
certainly
anticipates
that
there
would
be
further
state
court
actions,
they
demanded
that
reserve
fund
go
through
the
year
2008,
that
in
the
event
of
any
state
court
actions
they
would
have
money
that
they
would
get
back,
and
that
was
out
of
the
$180
million.
in...
that...
judge
weinstein
had
said
that
that
reserve
fund
would
be
stay...
would
be
held
for
futures
after
1994.
in
1994,
that
reserve
fund
at
petitioner
dow's
request
was
then
given
to
the...
to
the
class
assistance
program,
so
the
reserve
fund
that
was
supposed
to
be
there
to
2008,
and
had
the
capability
of
paying
some
money
for
post
1994
claimants,
was
also
depleted.
that's...
i
bring
that
up
because
that's
the
question
you
had...
the
question
throughout
the
proceedings,
and
as
this
court
said
in
shutts,
is...
that
adequacy
has
to
be
at
all
times.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
i...
the
standard
is
de
novo,
and
let
me
say
why.
there
are
things
that
you
cannot
ask
for
collateral
review
on.
there...
there
are
many
things
in
rule
23.
for
instance,
in
amchem,
the
predominance
question,
that,
that
is
for
direct
review,
whether
it,
the
class
is
certified.
the
question
as
to
collateral
review
goes
to
due
process
protections,
and
the
protections
are...
go
to
in
personam
jurisdiction.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
it's...
i
don't
find
it...
i
don't
think
it's
odd
in
the
sense
of
what's
being
reviewed.
the
question
that's
being
reviewed
is
whether
mr.
stephenson
was
properly
before
the
court.
whether
somebody's
properly
before
the
court
is
reviewed
de
novo
by
the
second
court
because
it's
a
jurisdictional
question,
so
the
question,
the
limited
question
that's
reviewed
by
the
second
court
is,
in
this
situation
we're
saying,
somebody
doesn't
have
to
be
personally
before
the
court--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--it
does...
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
now
you're
asking
us
to
apply
a
higher
one.
we're
ask...
it's
reviewed
by
an
appellate
court
for
abuse
of
discretion
standard
related
to
the
person
that
made
the
claim
in
the
prior,
in
the
underlying
court.
that
person
was
there
to
appear,
voice
his
objections
before
the
court,
have...
have
a
chance
to
present
evidence,
and
was...
and
the
court
had
personal
jurisdiction
of
that
person.
that's
why
we
think
that
the...
the
allusions
to
the
habeas
corpus
are
inapplicable.
the
question,
the
fundamental
question
here
is
not
the
settlement
as
a
whole.
it
was,
was
mr.
stephenson
there?
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
at
best.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
yes.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
it's...
it's,
yes.
it's
only
stare
decisis.
there
was
no
class
represented.
ivy
was
there
for
himself,
and
goes
no
far...
i
mean,
that...
and
that
wouldn't...
and
ivy
can't
revisit
it.
that
would
be
this
decision,
this
court's
decision
in
moitie,
in
federated
stores
v.
moitie,
the...
that...
it
wouldn't
be
for
ivy,
but
stephenson
was
not
there.
he
didn't
have
a
chance
to
make
his
arguments,
and
he
wasn't...
he--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--on...
on
notice,
as...
as
the
chief
justice
wrote
in
the
shutts
decision,
the
minimum
of
due
proces
is--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--but
the...
my
understanding
is
the
basis
for
this
court
s...
to
review
shutts
was
that
phillips
stated
that
there
was
a
potential
of
collateral
review,
and
that's
what
gave
phillips
standing
to
be
before
the
court,
and
in...
in
that
case
the
court
decided
the
jurisdictional
standard
that
would
allow...
and
it
set
a
minimal
jurisdictional
standard.
you
don't...
phillips
had
argued
you
personally
have
to
be
there,
and
this
court
said
no,
you
don't.
we'll...
we'll
deem
you
to
have
been
there
if
you
have
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard,
and
opportunity
to
opt
out,
and
adequacy
of
representation.
and
the
adequacy
of
representation
is
very
important
because
we
have
to
assume
that
the
person
representing
somebody
had
the
same
interests
at
heart
as
the
person
who's
never
before
the
court.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
yes.
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
well,
let
me--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--let
me
raise
two
things,
because
when
the
second
circuit
here
said
it,
and
judge
cardamone
sat
on
both
ivy
and
this
case.
he
was
on
both
cases
and
said
we
never
considered
this
before,
and
when
he
said
we
never
considered
this
before,
it
was
that
this
person
was
getting
nothing,
and
their
justification
in
ivy,
that
the...
that
ivy
was
still
eligible
for
funds
was
no
longer
applicable
to
stephenson,
who
was
eligible
for
nothing,
so
that's
one
part
of,
of,
of
the
equation.
the
other
part
is
that
adequacy
itself,
once...
we
go
to
what's
litigated
before.
what
happened
after
the
settlement
has
never,
could
not
have
been
litigated
before,
and
it
was
never...
the
adequacy
deficiencies
that
occurred
after
the
settlement
were
not
before
any
court
before.
mr.

smoger
no,
after...
well--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--after
the
judgment.
i
mean--
mr.
gerson
h.
smoger
--yes,
after
the
judgement
there's...
continued
the
inadequacy,
even
after
the
settlement.
i
mean,
it's
a
peculiar
fact
in
this
case
in
terms
of
the,
the
actual
settlement
and
the
fairness
hearing,
the...
whether
somebody
had
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
object
when
the
fairness
hearing
gave
no
distribution
at
all,
and
just
basically
dumped
the
money
into
the
judge
as
parens
patriae
and
said,
decide
it
however
you
want
without
representation,
the
petitioner
seems
to
think
that's
okay,
and
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
rule
of
law
to
say
that
you
can
get
around
any
due
process
protections
and
any
injustice
just
by
putting
money
into
the...
into
a
court.
that's...
courts
would
have
those
responsibilities
in
every
case,
because
that
absolves
all
the
parties
of
anything
that
might
be...
that
might
have
been
wrong
in
any
type
of
representation.
thank
you.
