mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
rely
on
four
propositions
in
this
case.
first,
there
is
a
long
final
judgment
in
the
agent
orange
litigation
that
binds
a
class
which
by
its
terms
includes
respondents.
second,
all
of
the
judges
in
the
direct
proceedings,
the
trial
judges
and
the
appellate
judges,
concluded
that
all
veterans
should
be
included
in
the
class
and
settlement,
because
all
of
the
veterans,
whether
they
were
symptomatic
or
not,
face
the
overwhelming
prospect
of
legal
defeat
on
issues
common
to
the
entire
class,
first
and
foremost,
the
government
contractor
defense.
third,
adequacy
of
representation
was
expressly
considered
several
times,
both
generally
and
with
specific
respect
to
asymptomatic
veterans,
by
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
and
fourth,
there
is
simply
no
question
that
judge
weinstein,
whose
scholarship
on
class
actions
the
1966
rule
23
advisory
committee
repeatedly
cited,
and
who
literally
wrote
the
book
on
mass
tort
litigation,
conscientiously
applied
the
procedures
of
rule
23,
including,
in
particular,
the
obligation
that
he
certify
and
thereafter
ensure
adequacy
of
representation.
now,
the
respondents
may
certainly
challenge
the
res
judicata
effect
of
the
judgment
against
them,
and
the
question
presented
for
this
court
is
the
permissible
scope
and
standard
of
that
review.
in
our
view,
due
process
does
not
require
and
finality
principles
do
not
permit
de
novo
relitigation
from
scratch
of
the
adequacy
determination
made
in
this
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
o'connor,
notice
in
this
case...
i
think
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
the
court
certainly
cannot
decide
this
case
on
the
principle
that
the
notice
was
constitutionally
inadequate.
in
the
first
place,
both
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
three
times
found
the
notice
adequate
under
rule
23
and
under
the
due
process
clause.
the
second
circuit
below
suggested
that
this
court's
decision
in
amchem
might
have
made
the
notice
defective,
but
notice
issues
were
not
presented
by
the
respondents
in
this
case
as
an
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance
in
their
brief
in
opposition,
and
what
is
more,
their
factual
record
in
this
case
is
completely
inadequate
to
conclude
that
the
notice
was
unsatisfactory
with
respect
to
the
content.
i
completely
understand
the
argument
that
they're
making
with
respect
to
how
the
words,
injured
by
exposure,
would
have
been
read
at
the
time,
but
one
cannot
answer
that
question
either
in
a
vacuum,
without
looking
at
the
external
circumstances,
or
in
hindsight.
one
has
to
determine
whether,
in
1984,
an
asymptomatic
veteran,
a
healthy
veteran,
would,
whether
all
of
them,
many
of
them,
most
of
them,
some
of
them,
or
some
significant
number
would
have
understood
that
that
includes
me
because
exposure
itself
has
been
said
to
be
injurious.
now,
at
footnote
12--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
ginsburg,
before
i
answer
that,
let
me
just
give
one
more
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
and
i'll
directly
address
your
question.
the
only
other
point
i
wanted
to
make...
i'm
afraid
i'll
forget
it...
is
that
in
footnote
12
of
our
reply
brief
we
point
out
that
at
the
time,
that
is,
at
the
time
of
certification
and
before
settlement,
publications
ranging
from
the
new
york
times
to
penthouse
magazine,
which
we
put
at
the
end
of
our
footnote,
and
newspapers,
local
newspapers
in
the
states
that
these
two
respondents
reside
in,
understood
that
the
class
included
all
veterans
in
vietnam
who
were...
were
or
may
have
been
exposed,
and
that's
the
factual
issue
that,
without
which
you
can't
resolve
the
notice
issue
in
this
case
adverse
to
us.
now,
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
first
of
all,
justice
ginsburg,
as
you
pointed
out,
the
metro
north
case,
a)
long
post
dated
the
final
judgment
in
this
case,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
i
do
understand
that,
and
it
was
looking
to
traditional
common
law
in
order
to
make
a
ruling
with
respect
to
the
fela.
now,
at
the
time,
in
19...
i
mean,
our
submission
essentially
is,
here
the
adequacy
determination
and
the
article
iii
claims
sort
of
mesh
together,
but
our...
our
submission
here
is
that
injury
in
fact,
which
is
what
is
necessary
in
order
to
include
them
in
the
class,
is
not
dependent
on
the
existence
of
a
mature
cause
of
action.
they
clearly
alleged
that
they
were
injured
in
fact
because,
as
new
york
state
and
other
states
recognized
at
the
time,
there
was
a
mature
tort
for
exposure,
injury
by
exposure,
and
many,
many
states
recognized
that
and
applied
that
rule
at
the
time,
and
in
any
event,
whether
or
not
they
had
a
mature
cause
of
action,
they
plainly
had
a
present
right
at
the
time
and
a
cognizable
interest
in
the
establishment
of
a...
of
a
fund
that
would
be
available
to
compensate
them.
that's
the
word
this
court--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
there...
i
believe
there
are
at
least
two
separate
questions--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
i'll
deal
with
the
respondents
in
this
case
first.
they
allege
that
they
never
saw
any
notice
saying
anything
at
any
time,
which
makes...
and
of
course
we
know
from
dusenbery,
and
before
that
mullane,
that
actual
notice
isn't
required,
so
the
wording
of
the
no...
these
are
peculiarly
inappropriate
parties
to
be
complaining
about
the
wording
of
one
of
the
many
notices
that
went
out
in
this
case.
there
were
at
least
three,
and
perhaps
four
notices
that
went
out,
and
the
notice
that
they
are
putting
their
attention
on
is
the
notice
certifying--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--not
at
all.
we
think
that
there
clearly
are...
since
actual
notice
isn't
required,
we
don't
think
that
they
lack
standing
to,
on
behalf
of
the
2.4
million
people
who
were
in
the
class--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--to
say
that
we
have...
mullane
requires
that
the
content
of
the
notice
be
adequate
as
well
as
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
ginsburg,
this
point,
and
indeed
most,
if
not
all
of
the
points
that
the
respondents
are
making
in
this
collateral
litigation,
were
made
by
my
clients
in
the
direct
proceedings
before
judge
weinstein
and
in
the
mandamus
petition
that
went
up
to
the
second
circuit
from
his
class
certification
decision.
we
argued
that
there
should
be
individual
notice
to
all
veterans.
the
government
represented,
the
plaintiffs
claimed,
and
both
the
trial
court
and
the
second
circuit
expressly
found--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
there
was
not
such
a
list.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
asymptomatic?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
named
representatives
were
not
asymptomatic,
and
by
design.
judge
weinstein
wanted
to
put
in
front
of
the
jury
the
strongest,
most
sympathetic
cases
for
causation,
and
there...
at
the
time
of
settlement
in
this
case,
the
symptomatic
representatives
were
completely
representative
of
the
views
of
all
veterans,
because
they
had
the
following
overwhelming
objectives:
defeat
the
government
contractor
defense
which,
as
it
turns
out,
was
applied
both
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
grant
judgment
against
the
people
who
actually
opted
out
and
pursued
their
claims.
secondly,
to
establish
a
defense
to
the
company's
defense
that
the
government
had
misused
it,
that
the
government
had
prevented
them
from
putting
warnings
on,
and
to
prove
general
causation,
that
is,
to
establish
proof
by
a
preponderance--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
ginsburg,
the
distinction
here,
even
at
the
distribution
phase...
and
remember,
the
parties,
the
plaintiffs'
representatives
and
the
plaintiffs'
lawyers,
recognizing
the
extreme
weakness
of
their
legal
claims,
however
great
the
pathos
was,
and
genuine
anguish
that
they
suffered,
that
their
legal
claims
were
so
weak
they
were
willing
to
settle
this
case
and,
on
the
assumption
that
judge
weinstein
and
the
special
master
would
allocate
the
formula,
and
the...
i
would
say
the
proof
in
the
pudding
is
that
the
named
representatives
included
six
veterans.
i
believe
only
two
of
them
were
ever
given
cash
benefits
in
this
case,
as
opposed
to
the
general
benefits
that
the
class
received
from
the
$70
million
class--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
were
all--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
were
all
symptomatic,
and
our
submission
here
is
that,
as
judge
weinstein
found
and
the
second
circuit
found,
in
response
to
precisely
these
arguments,
the
pervasive,
overwhelming,
common
weakness
that
all
of
the
plaintiffs
had
with
respect
to
the
legal
issues
made
the
representation
of
asymptomatic
veterans--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
souter,
i...
i
do
at
some
point
want
to
argue
to
the
court
why
we
think
that
de
novo
relitigation
of
adequacy
is
not
appropriate
on
collateral
review,
but
even
if
it
were,
i
believe
i
have
a
satisfactory
answer
to
your
question.
first
of
all,
the
way
that
the
distribution,
the
allocation
proceedings
occurred,
with
hearings,
multiple
hearings,
multiple
submissions
not
only
by
the
class
representatives
whose
proposal
was
uniquely
rejected
by
judge
weinstein,
but
by
individual
veterans,
veterans
groups,
actuaries,
scientists--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that,
to
be
sure.
to
be
sure,
but
they
were...
the
class...
first
of
all,
and
shutts
itself
stands
for
the
proposition,
phillips
petroleum
v.
shutts
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
court
and
the
parties
adverse
to
the
class
may
supply
the
arguments
and
the
necessary
sharpness
in
an
adversary
system
to
assure
that
in
the
main
the
procedures
followed
were
sufficiently
fundamentally
fair,
but
here
i
think
it's
very
important
not
to
character...
not
to
understand
that
in
1984
this
looked
like
the
type
of
futures
versus
presents
that
existed
in
amchem
and
existed
in
ortiz.
first--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
the...
this...
in
those
cases
you
had
a
situation
in
which
people
who
presently
suffered
from
asbestosis
and
mesothelioma
and
the
other...
the
other
tragic
manifestations
of
asbestos
exposure
had
valuable,
demonstrably
valuable...
there
was
a
matrix
to
figure
out
how
much
they
were
entitled
to,
and
the
rest
of
the
class,
which,
unlike
here,
included...
in
the
asbestos
context
included...
the
entire
civilized
world
who
may
or
may
not
have
been
exposed
to
asbestos,
had
claims
worth
nothing.
in
this
case
the
district
court
and
the
second
circuit
found
repeatedly
that
what
united
these
people
was,
none
of
them
had
a
legal
claim
that
was
worth
anything
under
the
way
the
law
existed
at
the
time,
and
we
think
exists
now.
secondly,
the
distinction
between
futures
and
presents
was
one
of
many,
many,
many
different
ways
that
you
could
distinguish
among
the
class.
the
more
salient
one,
we
think,
was
between
people
who
would
recover
anything
under
the
settlement
and
people
who
would
recover
nothing
under
the
settlement.
for
example--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
that
there...
there...
judge
weinstein
recognized,
and
several
people
who
appeared
before
him
and
provided
testimony,
written
and
oral
testimony
in
the
fairness
hearings,
in
the
distribution
hearings,
in
the
motion
for
reconsideration,
and
written
objections,
and
a
motion
to
certify
a
class,
made
him
very
aware
that,
and
he
himself
was
aware
from
reading
the
literature,
that
the
latency
period
for
many
diseases
is
as
long
as
40
years,
and
there
would
be
claims
that
would
come
up
long
into
the
future
that
some
people
would
attribute
to
exposure
to
agent
orange,
and
what
he
did
was,
he
said,
i
will--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
what
judge
weinstein
found,
and
what...
the
second
circuit
on
appeal
insisted
that
the
settlement
fund
be
entirely
disposed
of
within
the
period.
what
judge
weinstein
found
was,
we
have
to
make
provision
for
all
veterans
who
were
exposed.
i'm
going
to
do
it
in
two
ways,
given
the
size
of
the
class
and
the
indeterminacy
of
the
law.
number
1,
i'm
going
to
set
aside
a
certain
pot
of
this
money
to
provide
cash
benefits.
it
will
be
insufficient.
it
will
be
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
insurance,
although
more
than
sufficient
as
a
matter
of
proximate
causation,
since
nobody
can
demonstrate
that.
i'm
then
going
to
take
what
turned
out
to
be
$70
million
and
use
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
class
as
a
whole,
for
educational
programs,
for
counseling
programs,
for
health
programs,
for
the
very
kinds
of
programs
that
produced
the
enactment
of
the
agent
orange
legislation
that
now
provides,
on
a
monthly
basis,
more
money
than
almost
any
veteran
got,
period,
and
also
funded
the
medical
studies
and
scientific
studies,
or
prompted
enactment
of
legislation
that
funded
the
studies
that
now
allow
them
to
claim
that
there
are...
that
there
is
greater
evidence
of
an
association.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
as
to
the
other...
as
to
the...
pardon
me.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
i
could.
may
i
say
one
sentence
in
response
to
justice
o'connor--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
i
will.
with
respect
to
the
75
percent
of
the
fund
that
went
for
compensation,
judge
weinstein
understood
and
did
reserve
a
very
substantial
portion
of
that
for
people
who
manifested
in
the
future,
and
the
respondents
in
the
case
were
just
like
the
respondents
in
ivy/hartman,
which
is,
they
were
asymptomatic.
they
didn't
know
whether
they
were
going
to
become
ill
and,
if
so,
when,
and
what
judge...
and
many...
thousands
of
claims
were
paid
of
people
who
manifested
disease
in
the
future,
and
what
judge
weinstein
said
is,
look,
at
some
point,
the
time
passage
is
so
great
that
it
simply
becomes
almost
impossible,
as
a
matter
of
causation,
to
be
able...
we
all
get
sick,
and
unfortunately
we
all
die,
and
many
of
us
get
diseases,
and
as
time
passes,
he
ruled,
it
becomes
less
and
less
likely
you
could
ever
prove
causation,
and
that's
why
he
drew
the
line
that
he
did.
mr.
chief
justice,
our
proposition
with
respect
to
the
standard
of
review
is
threefold.
first
of
all,
it
should
not
be
de
novo
redetermination
of
adequacy.
second,
because
there
was
no
showing
of
collusion
or
fraud,
which
are
recognized
exceptions
to
the
res
judicata
effect
of
a
judgment,
and
because
the
courts
conscientiously
applied
procedures
that
congress
adopted
specifically
in
response
to
hansberry
in
order
to
provide
procedures
that
in
the
main
will
provide
fundamental
fairness
in
all
but
the
most
extraordinary
cases,
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
that
is
the
question
on
collateral
review.
and
third,
even
if
that
is
not
true,
and
even
if
a
court
should
take
note
of
the
substantive
claim
of
inadequacy
of
representation,
the
prior
determination
should
be
subject
to
a
highly
deferential
standard
that
is
appropriate
for
a
collateral
attack
on
a
20-year-old
judgment
in
which
pervasive--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--finality
and
reliance
interests--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
breyer,
first
of
all
the
second
circuit
did
not
do
that.
notably
it
didn't
do
it.
it
didn't
do
it
in
a
case
in
which
there
are
60
reported
decisions,
something
like
13,000
docket
entries
in
the
district
court
alone.
what
it
said
is,
we're
going
to
retroactively
apply
amchem.
we're
going
to
conclude
that
amchem
was
a
due
process
decision,
even
though
it
explicitly
disavowed
that,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--our
submission
that
you--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--certainly
not.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
certainly
not.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'm
just
pointing
out
that
amchem
didn't
redetermine
adequacy
as
a
factual
matter.
it
concluded
that
as
a
matter
of
law--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
ginsburg,
with
respect,
we
cited
in
our
brief
district
court
decisions
in
the
1980's
that
were--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--both
the
second
circuit
in
this
case
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
epstein
case
on
which
we
rely
characterized
amchem
as
heralding
a
new
era,
or
being
a
watershed
decision,
and
our
submission
only
is
that
for
purposes
of
the
new
rules,
doctrine
that
this
court
announced,
for
example,
in
teague
v.
lane
and
following
cases,
the
burden
is
on
the
party
that
seeks
to
invoke
the
benefit
of
a
later-decided
case
to
prove
that
a
conscientious
court
prior
to
the
announcement
of
the
rule
would
have
been,
quote,
compelled
to
conclude
that
futures
could
not
be
included
in
the
class.
now,
as
to
the
standard
of
review,
this
court's
decision...
this
court
even
in
teague
itself,
which
was
a
criminal
case,
the
court
said,
to
be
sure,
in
civil
cases
finality
concerns
are
far,
far
more
important,
and
in
cases
like
brecht
and
herrera,
this
court
has
emphasized
over
and
over
again,
even
when
a
defendant's
life
is
at
stake,
that
on
collateral
review,
in
a
subsequent
review
of
a
final
judgment,
the
showing
has
to
be,
quote,
necessarily
far
higher
to
obtain
relief
than
on
direct
review.
this
court's
decisions
in
the...
in
jurisdiction
cases,
subject
matter
and
personal
jurisdiction
cases,
where
we're
talking
about
the
fundament
of
the
power
of
the
original
court
to
decide
the
case
prove
that,
if
there...
in
stohl
v.
gotlieb,
this
court
pointed
out
that
with
respect
to
the
first
proceeding,
even
without
any
express
discussion
of
it,
we
have
to
assume,
and
we
will
conclusively
presume
that
the
original
court
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
unless
it
would
have
been
a,
quote,
manifest
abuse
of
authority
to
have
done
so,
and
with
respect
to
personal
jurisdiction,
durfee
v
duke
and
iowa
v.
baldwin
and
those
other
cases
all
stand
for
the
proposition
that
if
the
prior
court,
quote,
has
decided
the
question
of
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
as
a
contested
issue
there
will
be
no
reinquiry
into
personal
jurisdiction.
we're
not
even
advocating
that
rule
in
our
second
test.
we're
just
saying,
it
should
be
deferential.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
ginsburg,
this
is
a
representative
suit.
there
is
a
judgment
that
says,
at
this
point,
with
respect,
there
is
a
judgment
that
said,
these
parties
were
there.
now,
the
analogy
i
think
that
would
be
appropriate
here
would
be
with
reference
to
the...
the
default
judgment
cases,
where
you
can
say,
you
can't
have
a
default
judgment
on
jurisdiction
because
no
one
appeared
to
contest
it.
that
can't
happen
in
a
representative
suit.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
blue
brief,
the
judge
cannot
grant
a
default
judgment
in
a
class
action.
he
has
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--he
has
to
make
the
determination
that
the
representation
was
adequate,
and
it
was
made
repeatedly
and
affirmed
repeatedly
in
this
case.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
o'connor,
the...
the
isaacson
case
can't
just
be
remanded,
because
we
assert
jurisdiction
under
1442.
justice
breyer,
it
is
not
the
case...
adequacy
in
general,
and
specifically
with
respect
to
futures
was
specifically
raised
and
determined
before
the
judgment
became
final
as
well
as
in
ivy/hartman.
the
second
circuit's
decision
at
818
f.
2d
167
says,
quote,
appellants
argue
that
the
diverse
interests
of
the
class
make
adequate
representation
virtually
impossible.
we
disagree.
they
were
responding
to
a
brief
that
particularly
brought
the
precise
issue
to
their
attention,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
we
think
that
you
should
reverse
the
judgment--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--he
is
indeed
bound--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--by
the
final
judgment
in
this
case
both
because
he
was
adequately
represented,
and
a
determination
after
a
full
consideration
was
made.
he
was...
our
submission
is
that
there's
no
argument
that...
that
procedures
that
were
enacted
to
protect
due
process
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
were
followed,
and
therefore
he's
bound
under
walters
and
those
other,
that
due
process
line,
and
in
any
event,
if
you
take
a
look
at
adequacy
you
should,
a)
give
tremendous
deference,
and
because
the
issue
has
been
decided,
because
the
consequences
of
not
giving
deference
would
be
unbelievably
unsettling.
these
adequacy
determinations
are
not
easy,
and
res
judicata
doesn't
exist
for
the
easy
cases.
the
consequence
of
hundreds,
if
not
thousands
of
other
cases...
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
