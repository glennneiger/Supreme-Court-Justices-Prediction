justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
you
saying
that
even
though
the
notice
was
improper,
since
they
didn't
see
any
notice
at
all,
they
can't
complain
about
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smoger,
supposing
this
is
back
in
1984,
when
the
judgment
is
about
to
be
entered,
and
the
dow
says
in
effect,
you
know,
we
think
you
really
have
a
lousy
claim
on
the
merits,
but
we're
willing
to
pay
$200
million
if
we...
we
know
that
this
will
be
the
last
of
it.
now,
your
clients
became
ill
in
19,
what,
98?
justice
john
paul
stevens
1996
and
1998.
how
could
the
defendant
in
this
case,
or
how
could
the
court
in
this
case
have
affected
a
settlement
that
would
bind
everybody?
i
mean,
how
about
people
who
perhaps
get
sick
in
2018?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
it...
would
it
have
been
sufficient
to
say,
have
one
class
representative
be...
represent
all
those
who
were
then
asymptomatic
that
might
later
get
it,
or
would
you
have
to
break
that
down?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
in
some
cases
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
there
has
not...
is
not
going
to
mean
that
he
can
get
de
novo
review,
i
would
think,
of
the
determination
that
he's
bound
by
the
class
settlement.
you're
saying
that
when
it
comes
to
adequacy
of
representation,
it
is
de
novo
on
collateral
review?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
shutts...
shutts
was
not
a
collateral
review,
i
don't
believe.
