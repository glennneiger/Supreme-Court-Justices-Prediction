mr.
waxman,
i'd
like
to
stop
you
right
there,
exposure
itself
has
been
said
to
be
injurious.
this
court
in
metro
north
said,
exposure
only
people
have
no
claim,
and
it
did
so
purporting
to
use
traditional
common
law
in
interpreting
the
fela,
so
according
to
this
court's
decision
in
metro
north,
isn't
it
clear
that
these
people
had
no
ripe
claim
to
state,
and
how
could
they
be
adequately
represented
when
their
claim
had
not
yet
accrued?
as
i
understand
the
law
of
both
louisiana
and
new
jersey,
where
these
cases
come
from,
the
claim
doesn't
accrue
until
the
exposure
has
manifested
itself
in
an
injury,
in
an
illness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'd
like
to
ask
you
later
how
that
comports
with,
what
is
it,
eisen
and
jacquelin.
i
mean,
you
could
have,
if
you
really
thought
this
was
the
class,
given
mail
notice
to
all
the
veterans,
all
the
people
who
had
served
in
vietnam,
and
newspaper
service
is
very
nice,
but
it's
rarely
seen
by
anyone,
but
anyway,
let's
get
back
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
this
court
has
said,
under
the
common
law,
people
who
were
merely
exposed,
who
do
not
have
a
current
injury,
don't
have
any
claims.
they
may
never
have
a
claim,
but
they
certainly
have
no
ripe
claim
at
this
stage.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
purported
to
apply
traditional
common
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--actual
notice
isn't
required
when
you
don't
know
the
people.
it
is
required,
best
notice
practicable,
in
mullane,
when
you
knew
the
names,
they
were
identified
beneficiaries...
justice
jackson
says
those
people
have
got
to
get
mail
notice.
it's
only
when
you
don't
know
the
error
hasn't...
who
the
person
is,
that
the
other
is
adequate.
here,
there
were
records,
who
served
in
vietnam
from
'61
to
'72,
so
you
did
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr....
mr.
waxman,
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
waxman,
that's
well
and
good
that
your
clients,
the
defendants
in
this
case
did
that,
but
here
we
have
a
class
of
people,
potential
plaintiffs.
who
represented
them?
was
there
anyone
in
this
case,
other
than
the
judge,
who
has
a
global
settlement,
is
there
any...
were
any
of
the
named
representatives
asym--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
were
any
of
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
we
get
past
that,
mr.
waxman,
adequacy
of
representation
has
to
exist
at
all
stages
of
the
litigation,
and
we're
getting
to
the
point
where
there
isn't
going
to
be
any
trial.
there's
going
to
be
a
settlement
fund,
and
i
suppose
if
i
were
representing
someone
who
was
not
going
to
be
diseased
until
1998,
i
never
would
have
consented
to
a
settlement
fund
that
will
run
dry
in
1994.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one
thing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
didn't
do
anything
new.
mr.--
waxman,
you
put
it
in
your
brief,
repeated
it
today.
you
said,
retroactively
apply
amchem.
as
far
as
i
know
that
decision,
like
ortiz,
were
not
doing
anything
new.
they
were
applying
the
law
that
existed
then
that
the
court
thought
was
the
law
before,
so
amchem
was
not
a
change
in
the
law.
this
was
not
a
new
rule.
this
was
the
court's
attempt
to
interpret
what
the
rule
meant
when
the
rule
first
came
on
the
books,
and
what
it
meant
over
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
two
district
court
decisions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
a
single
court
of
appeals
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
these
were
all
parties
who
were
there.
every
case
that
you
mentioned,
durfee,
these
people
weren't
there,
so...
and
in
habeas,
all
the
criminal
cases,
of
course
the
defendant
was
there.
these
are
two
people
who
say,
we
weren't
there,
and
we
didn't
have
a
chance
to
litigate
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
representation
is
adequate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
formally
there
had
to
be
made
an...
you
couldn't
have
a
class
action.
to
certify
the
class
action
there
must
be
a
finding
of
adequacy.
there
certainly
was
such
a
finding.
you're
saying
that
that
was
incorrect,
because
your
clients
were
not
represented
by
anybody.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
certify
a
class,
you
must
find
that
the
representatives
are
adequately
representing
the
class.
