now,
it
sounds
to
me
when
you
say
all
those
things
that
you're
really
saying,
can't
settle
a
class
action.
unknown
speaker
it's
very
odd
that
abuse
of
discretion
is
the
standard
on
direct
review,
and
on
collateral
review
you
have
a
more
generous
standard.
that's
very
odd.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
[=
10]
o'clock.
