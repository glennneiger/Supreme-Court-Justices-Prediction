mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
hernandez
v.
new
york
described
a
hypothetical
case,
a
case
in
which
the
evidence
of
racial
discrimination
during
jury
selection
was
so
strong
that,
quote,
"a
finding
of
no
discrimination
is
simply
too
incredible
to
be
accepted.
"
this
is
truly
that
exceptional
case,
and
therefore
the
court
should
use
it
as
a
model,
a
model
of
the
weight
of
evidence
sufficient
to
render
objectively
unreasonable
a
trial
judge's
rejection
of
a
batson
challenge.
indeed,
whatever--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
want
to
embrace
them,
mr.
chief
justice.
[laughter]
i
fully
recognize,
as
an
officer
of
this
court
and
somebody
who
has
followed
this
jurisprudence,
that
even
on
direct...
that
the
deference
that
is
paid
to
a
trial
judge
in
a
batson
hearing
is
so
strong
that
even
in
hernandez,
this
case
said
on
direct
review...
and
hernandez
made
reference
to
the
high
standards
of
proof
in
habeas...
even
on
direct
review,
we
are
going
to
require
proof
that
a
trial
court's
finding
of
fact
in
a
batson
hearing
is
erroneous
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
and
to
that,
aedpa
enacted
subsection
2254(d)(2),
which
says
that
you...
a
writ
may
not
issue
unless
the
state
court
adjudication
resulted
in
a
decision
that
was
based
on
an
unreasonable
determination
of
the
facts
in
light
of
the
evidence
presented.
there
are
very
good
reasons
to
provide
these
dual
levels
of
deference
to
the
trial
judge.
the
trial
judge
in
the
case,
of
course,
is
the
finder
of
fact,
and
in
hernandez
this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
ultimate
finding
in
this
case,
the
finding
of
whether
or
not
the
trial
prosecutor
engaged
in
intentional
discrimination
in
making
race
the
tipping
factor,
a
but-for
factor
with
respect
to
the
strike
of
any
peremptory...
of
any
juror
under
a
peremptory
challenge...
is
a
factual
determination.
but
(d)(2)
and
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard
are
there
for
a
reason.
they
are
there
for
the
truly
exceptional
case
in
which
there
are
reasons
to
believe
that
the
trial
judge's
findings
are
deluded,
and
there
are
reasons
to
believe
that
the
evidence
suggesting
that
the
trial
judge's
finding
was
unreasonable
are
overwhelming.
and
i'd
like
to
address
the
first
first
and
the
second
second,
because
i
think
it
is
entirely
clear
that
given
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
way
in
which
the...
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
conducted
the
hearing,
that
whatever
this
court
decides,
this
case
is
going
to
stand
as
a
benchmark,
either
that
these
facts
represent
an
extreme
that
cannot
be
tolerated
or
that
even
these
extreme
facts
are
tolerable
under
batson.
now,
let
me
speak
first
to
the
trial
judge.
the
trial
judge
was
conscientious
and
he
was,
of
course,
to
some
extent
disabled
by
the
fact
that
the
trial
in
this
case
immediately
preceded
this
court's
decision
in
batson.
that
is,
this
is
one
of
these
few
cases
where
the
trial
occurred
before
batson,
but
the
case
was
pending
on
direct
appeal
when
batson
was
decided.
and
so
we
have
in
this
case
a
trial
judge
who
conducted
the
batson
hearing
over
2
years
after
the
jurors
testified
and
after
the
trial
prosecutors
gave
their
reasons
for
all
but
two
of
the
jurors.
and
therefore,
the
one
hallmark
of
deference,
which
is
that
the
trial
judge
is
a
percipient
witness
of
the
res
gestae,
if
you
will,
did
not
exist
in
this
case.
the...
the
decided
cases
under
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
reflect
significantly
more
than
a
dozen
cases
decided
by
this
judge
in
that
2-year
interim
period.
he
saw
thousands
of
venire
members
and
undoubtedly
heard
hundreds,
if
not
thousands,
of
batson
explanations.
and
moreover,
whereas
it
is
true
that
the
trial
judge
observes
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
and
a
prosecutor
can
certainly
use
as
a
race-neutral
reason
questions
raised
about
a
juror's
fitness
or
suitability
based
on
demeanor,
the
objections
in
this
case,
with
one
limited
exception,
the
prosecutor
said
nothing
about
the
demeanor.
the
prosecutor's
stated
objections
to
the
10
of
the
11
african
americans
who
were
struck
were
substantive
reasons
there
on
the
record.
in
addition,
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
did
not--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
can...
i...
i
embrace
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
for
many
years
before
i
entered
this
line
of
work,
i
was
a
trial
lawyer
and
i
can
remember
exercising
peremptory
strikes
just
because
of
hesitation.
my
only
limited
point
here
is
that
unlike
many
voir
dire
hearings...
and
i've
now
reviewed
many...
there
was
only
one
single
isolated
instance
in
which
the
prosecutor,
in
giving
his
reasons
either
at
the
time
or
in
the
batson
hearing,
said
he
hesitated
or
his
demeanor
led
me
to
question
it.
and
so
in
that
one
respect,
i...
again
i
think
this
case
is
more
susceptible
to
meaningful
appellate
review.
but
i
have
two
more
points
i
think
it's
very
important
for
the
court
to
consider
about
the
way
this
trial
judge
conducted
this
unusual
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
oh,
no.
it
was
direct
appeal.
the
case
was
tried.
there
was
an
immediate
appeal
taken.
during
the...
right
after...
i
think
a
month
after
the
case
was
tried,
batson
was
decided,
and
2
years
later,
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
abated...
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
10
of
11
african
americans
were
struck.
that
raises
an
inference
of
discrimination
under
batson.
remand
it
for
a
batson
hearing.
and
it
was
at
that
hearing
that
the
judge
made
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
that
are
reflected
in
the...
in
the
joint
appendix.
there
was
a
subsequent
habeas
proceeding
in
the
state
courts,
but
the
habeas
proceeding
didn't
deal
with
the
batson
issue
because
it
had
been
fully
exhausted.
the
trial
judge,
in
evaluating
batson,
did
not
look
at
the
very
substantial
evidence
of
pattern
and
practice
evidence
with
respect
to
what
was
going
on
in
dallas
county
at
this
time,
evidence
that
the
magistrate
deemed
appalling.
he
was
told
by
the
state
not
to
look
at
it.
he
did
not
consider
what
the
state
acknowledges
to
be
racially
disparate...
disparate
questioning
of
the
jurors
in
venire
on
the
question...
their
ability
to
impose
a
minimum
sentence--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we...
we
don't
know
to
a
certainty
that
he
didn't.
he
was
told
by
the
state
that
all
of
that
evidence
was
irrelevant.
indeed,
the
state
took
the
position
that
a...
that
comparative
evidence
between
white
jurors
and
black
jurors
was
irrelevant.
that
was
the
ground
on
which
they
urged
this
court
to
deny
the
petition
for
certiorari
on
direct
appeal.
all
i
can
say
is
it's
nowhere
reflected
in
the
district
judge's
opinion.
the...
the
trial
judge's
opinion
addresses
only
the
six
jurors
in
question
that
my
predecessor
claimed
were
struck
in
violation
of
batson.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
he
did.
and
there's
an
ambiguity,
and
that's
why
we
think,
interestingly,
that
this
case
is
a
(d)(2)
case
rather
than
a
(d)(1)
case.
in
this
court,
as
opposed
to
in
the
state
courts,
the
state
of
texas
is
here
before
you
saying
the
judge
considered
everything.
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
considered
everything.
they
don't
have
to
discuss
everything
that
they
considered,
and
therefore,
there
is
no
legal
error
that
was
committed.
and
our
submission
to
you
is
i
don't
know
if
that's
right
or
not.
it
doesn't
appear
to
be
right,
but
whether
it's
right
or
not,
the
result
that
they
reached,
the
conclusion
that
they
made
that
there
was
no...
that...
that
race
was
not
a
but
for
factor
with
respect
to
not
one,
not
two,
but
six
of
these
people.
under
the
record
in
this
case
and
in
light
of
the
way
they
conducted
the
jury
shuffle
in
this
case,
which
cannot
be
justified
on
non-racial
grounds--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'll
address
the
newspaper
articles
first,
i
guess
you
were
asking
about,
and
also
the
manual.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
newspaper
articles...
there
were
two
series
of
newspaper
articles.
there
were
three
articles
that
came
out
in
the
first
or
second
week
of
march
which
was
either
just
as
the
4
or
5
weeks
of
jury
selection
was
closing
or
after
it,
but
it
was
before
the
trial
began.
and
those
articles
precipitated
the...
what
was
called
a
swain
challenge
but
it...
what
became
a
swain-batson
challenge.
there
were...
there
were
other
articles
that
were
subsequently
issued
after
the...
after
the
trial
in
the
case
but
before
the
direct
appeal
and
the
batson
remand
that
looked
at
the
racial
percentages
in
capital
cases
which
mirrored
the...
in
many
ways
the...
the
march
9th
article
that
examined
jury
selection
in
100
felony
cases.
now,
the
manual.
there
were
two
manuals
in
the
case.
one
of
them,
the
earlier,
more
explicit
1963
manual,
was
not
offered.
it
is
discussed
in
the
march
9th
dallas
morning
news
article
which
was
admitted
in
evidence
at
the
batson
hearing.
the
other
manual,
the
john
sparling
manual...
mr.
sparling
testified.
there
was
testimony
in
the
case
by
judge
baraka
and
one
other
witness...
and
it
may
have
been
mr.
sparling...
that
they
were
not
sure
when
the
manual
ceased
to
be
used.
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
a
case
called
halliburton
concluded
that
the
manual
was
in
use
at
least
through
the
early
1980's
i
think
or
in...
by
1980
or
something
like--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--this
trial
was
'86
i
believe.
but
one
of
the
things
that's
most
striking
in
the
case
is...
there's...
there...
it
is
clear
that
at
least
one
of
the
two
prosecutors
in
this
case
was
trained
by
this
office
at
a
time
when
the
manual
was
concededly
in
use.
the
other
one
may
have
been.
but
one
of
the
things
that
i
found
striking,
just
going
through
the
juror
information
cards
yesterday
actually
in
preparing
for
the
oral
argument,
which
appear
in
the
joint
lodging
at
pages
54
to
108...
these
are
the
juror
cards
that
people
get,
the
prosecutors
and
trial
lawyers
get,
before
voir
dire
begins.
if
you
look
at
what
is
noted
there,
the
race
and
the
gender
and
religion
and
beards
and
things
like
that,
there
is
a
remarkable
coincidence
with
the
issues
and
factors
that
are
specifically
addressed
in
the
sparling
training
manual.
it's
not
our
submission
that
it's
proof
they
were
trained
by
it.
it's
not
our
submission
that
they
adhered
to
it
or
they
used
it.
we're
using
this
pattern
and
practice
evidence
just
as
a--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
answer
must
be
that
they
were
put
on
at
different
times.
if
you
look
at
the
notations
that
say...
the
race
and
the
gender
notations,
each
one
has
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
those
had
to
have
been
put
on
before
any
questioning
occurred
because
there...
they
are
on
those
cards
for
jurors
that
were
never
reached
or
were
never
questioned.
there
are
other
notations
about
answers
that
appear
to
be
in
different
handwriting,
and
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
it
at
all,
but
you
can
infer
that
they
were
noted
at
the
same
time
that
the
prosecution
made
notes
on
the
jury
questionnaires
which
are
also
in
the...
in
the
joint
lodging.
but
the...
the
other
point
i
just
want
to
make
about
the
trial
judge
is
the...
we
know...
there's
not
a
question
about
whether
the
trial
judge's
findings
are
unreasonable
in
light
of
the
evidence.
finding
number
6,
the
trial
judge
said
there
was
no
disparate
examination
of
any
venire
member.
well,
in
this
court,
the
state
has
totally
disavowed
that.
the
state
acknowledges
that
when
jurors
were
questioned
about
their
ability
to
impose
the
minimum
punishment
for
the
lesser
included
offense
of
murder,
they
used
two
different
scripts.
and
when
they
talked
about
the
means
of
execution,
they
used
a
graphic
script
that
went
on
in
detail
to
explain
how
somebody
is
executed
in
texas,
and
a
regular
script
that
just
said,
how
do
you
feel
about
the
death
penalty?
now,
they--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
it
does.
the
one
that
we're...
that...
that
you
have
to
focus
most
directly
on
is
number
10--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--which
is
the...
the
finding,
which
is
the
ultimate
finding.
but
my
point
is
that
there
are
a
number
of
findings
that
this
judge
made
that
are
at
the
very
least
suspect
and
one
in
which
the
state
has
completely
walked
away
from.
and
i
want...
i
want
to
spend,
if
i
can,
just
a
few
minutes
talking
about
the
jury
shuffle
and
the
disparate
questioning
because
i've
been
a
trial
lawyer
for
many
years,
but
never
tried
a
case
in
this
system,
and
it
was
sort
of
a
little
bit
confusing
to
me.
but
with
respect
to
the
disparate
questioning,
each
of
the
prospective
jurors
was
questioned
about
whether
they
could
impose
the
minimum
punishment
if
they
found
that
the
offense
was
murder
and
not
capital
murder,
and
the
minimum
punishment
being
5
years.
and
they
were
also
asked
about
their
views
about
capital
punishment.
now,
some
of
those
people
who
were
asked
about
their
views
about
capital
punishment
were
first
treated
to
a
graphic
description
of
how
that
punishment
occurs.
and
some
of
the
people
who
were
questioned
about
minimum
punishment
were
told
in
advance
the
range
is
5
years
to
99
years.
could
you
do
either?
and
many
of
them
were
just
asked,
what
do
you
think
the
minimum
penalty
is
that
you
would
impose
for
willful,
deliberate,
intentional,
cold-blooded
murder
where
there
was
no
robbery?
and
our
submission
in
our
principal
brief
and
below
was
that
the
state
used
those
disparities
in
a
racially
discriminatory
manner
and
that
bears
tremendously
on
the
intent
of
the
prosecutor
in
executing
the
peremptory
strikes.
and
their--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--not
at
all.
they
don't
have
to
ask
the
same
questions.
they
don't
have
to
ask
them
in
the
same
way.
all
that
we're
saying
is
that
when
they
do
ask
the
same
questions
and
they
ask
them
in
a
way
which
is
acknowledged
to
be
different
and
they
acknowledge
that
they--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
i...
i
managed
to
confuse
even
myself.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
prosecution...
i
believe
that
ms.
bunn
will
confirm.
the
prosecution
said
we
had
two
different
ways
of
questioning
about
these
two
subjects,
and
we
used
them
deliberately
at...
with
different
jurors
and
we
did
it
in
order
to
remove
jurors
that
we
thought
were
weak
on
the
death
penalty.
that
is
the
reason
that
they
give
and
that's
the
reason
against
which
their
justification
must
be
judged,
and
it
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--sure,
if
you...
i...
if
you...
somebody
says,
look,
i...
there's
no
way
i
can
impose
the
death
penalty,
and...
as
a...
as
a
prosecutor
i
don't...
i
don't
know
if
i
can
use
a
for
cause
strike,
i
don't
want
to
use
a
peremptory,
let
me
see
if
i
can't
get
them
to
say
something
that
will
allow
the
judge
to
knock
them
out
for
cause,
that's
entirely
legitimate.
the
question
is
why
did
they
do
it.
because
it
would
be
illegitimate
if
they
were
doing
it
deliberately
disproportionately
against
black
jurors
because
they
were
black
and
it
would
be
legitimate
if
they
were
saying,
okay,
you
know,
people
who
expressed
hesitation
about
the
death
penalty...
we're
going
to
do
everything
we
can
to
try
and
get
rid
of
these
people
for
cause.
and
let's
just
look
at
the
state's
own
statistics.
this
is
their
statistics
from
their
brief
at
pages
17
and
18
and
notes
38
and
39.
with
respect
to
minimum
punishment,
seven
of
the
eight
african
american
jurors
who
were
questioned
about
minimum
punishment
were
not
told
in
advance
that
the
minimum
punishment
was
5
years.
and
when
they
were
asked
what
they
thought
minimum
punishment
was,
they
said
20
years,
life.
one
person
said
that
he
thought
the
death
penalty
was
the
minimum...
minimum...
punishment.
for
the
whites,
36
white
jurors
were
questioned.
two...
only
two
were
not
told
that
it
was
5
years
in
advance.
now,
they
say
that's
not
fair
because
you
only
need
to
compare
those
jurors
who
had
expressed
hesitation
about
the
death
penalty
because
that
was
our
factor.
and
they
identify
in
their
brief
10
white
jurors
and
10
black
jurors
who
expressed
hesitation.
well,
two
things.
okay,
we'll
use
your
numbers.
that
means
that
of
the
10
black
jurors
who
expressed
hesitation,
7
were
given
this
trick
questioning
and
2--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--under
texas...
mr.
chief
justice,
under
texas
law,
that
is
grounds
for
disqualification
for
cause
and
the
prosecution
did
seek--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
inability
to
impose
the
minimum
punishment...
to
consider
the
minimum
punishment
that
the
law
allows.
and
they
did
try
and
strike
two
black
jurors
for
inability
to
impose
minimum
punishment,
however
odd
that
seems
given
the
role
of
the
prosecution
in
a
case.
they
say
there
were
10
of
each
and
even
taking...
10
hesitant
jurors,
and
even
taking
their
numbers
at...
at
their
word,
that
means,
nonetheless,
that
a
black
hesitant
juror
was
three-and-a-half
times
more
likely
than
a
white
to
be
struck.
and
it
doesn't
account
for
the
fact
that
their
10
white
jurors
wildly
understates
the
number
of
white
jurors
who
expressed
hesitation
about
the
death
penalty.
it
doesn't
even
include
a
white
juror
that
they
struck
for
cause
for
inability
to
impose
the
death
penalty,
mr.
sohner.
and
there
are
at
least
8
or
9
other
jurors
that
we
identify
in
our
papers
that
are
not
in
their
list
of
10.
so
even
if
you
take
their
universe
at
its
will,
blacks
were
three-and-a-half
times
more
likely
to
be
tricked
by
this
minimum
punishment
ploy
than
whites.
now,
on
the
graphic
script
about
the
death
penalty,
they
said,
you
bet,
there
were
some
people
that
we
went
through
all
the
gory
details
of
how
execution
occurs
because
we
were
trying
to
get
those
people
off
the
jury
because
they
were
hesitant
about
the
death
penalty,
but
we
did
it
with
hesitant
white
jurors
and
we
did
it
with
hesitant
black
jurors.
let's
look
at
their
numbers.
eight
of
the
15
african
american
jurors
were
given
the
graphic
script,
53
percent.
three
of
the
49
white
jurors
were
given
the
graphic
script.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
it
might...
it
might
be,
but
if
couldn't
be
on
this
record
because
there
were
only
15
black
jurors.
so
out
of
the
whole...
i'm
using
the
entire
universe
of
everyone
who
was
questioned.
let's
then
go
to
their
explanation.
they
say
it
only
applied
to
jurors
who
expressed
hesitation
about
the
death
penalty.
let's
just
look
at
that
universe.
there
was
10
of...
there
were
10
of
each.
okay.
that
means
that
7
of
the
10
black
jurors
that
they
say
expressed
hesitation
were
given
this
graphic
script,
and
of
the
10
white
jurors
that
say
expressed
hesitation,
2
were
given
this.
and
that
to
us
is
evidence
of
conduct
that
occurred
during
voir
dire
that
admits
of
only
a
racial
explanation
just
as
their
conduct
of
the
jury
shuffle,
which
is
a
ubiquitous
and
unique
texas
practice
that
exists
only
in
the
state
of
texas.
and
we
go
through
in
our
brief...
perhaps
in
as
not
as
much
detail
as...
as
would
be
appropriate
but,
nonetheless,
given
the
page
limits...
and
show
that
the
state
on
at
least
three
occasions
used
the...
its
prerogative
to
shuffle
the
jury
for
the
obvious
purpose
of
moving
african
american
jurors
who
were
in
the
front
of
the
venire
where
they
would
be
questioned
to
the
back
of
the
venire
each
week
where
they
would
not.
and
here
it's
important
to
understand
something
about
the
procedure
in
this
case.
there
was
a
different
venire
called
every
week.
jury
selection
extended
over
5
weeks.
each
week
either
40
or
50
new
venire
members
were
brought
into
the
courtroom,
and
they
were
seated
in
order.
and
as
soon
as
they
sat
down,
the
record
reflects,
the
judge
asked
the
state
first
and
then
the
defense
whether
they
wanted
to,
quote,
shuffle
the
jury.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
will
try
to
tell
you
and
i
would
respectfully
refer
you,
in
case
i
fail,
to
the
texas
bar
journal
article
that
we
cited
in
our
reply
brief
by
a
professor
at,
i
think,
the
university
of
houston
which
explains
this
practice.
but
in
texas,
jurors
of
course
are...
venires
are
required
to
be
chosen
randomly,
but
there
has
always
been
a
practice...
and
it's
now
codified
by
statute...
that
allows
the...
the
lawyers
in
the
case...
this
is
in
civil
and
criminal
cases...
to
look
at
the
venire
as
it's
arrayed
in
order
and
based
on
what
judge
holcomb
explained
for
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals,
based
on,
quote,
visual
preference,
because
they
haven't
questioned
these
jurors
at
all,
the
state
and
then
the
defense
can
say
we
want
to
reshuffle
the
order.
we
don't
like
the
order.
and
it
is
well
understood
in
texas
that
the
principal
reason
for
doing
that
is
race
and
gender.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
what
happens
is
you
take
the...
the
juror
cards
and
it's
either
done
in
the
central
jury
room
or
in
the
courtroom,
and
they
are
shuffled
either
by
the
clerk
shuffling
the
way
you
would
shuffle
a
deck
or,
in
this
case,
they
were
apparently,
according
to
the
record,
put
into
a
metal
basket
and
the
lawyer
would
sort
of
run
his
hands
around
and
they'd
pick
them
out,
and
they
would
then
be
in
a
new
order.
and
after
the
state
exercised
its
shuffle
or
declined
to
exercise
its
shuffle,
the
defense
could
choose
whether
to
shuffle
or
not.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
they
are
reseated
so
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--indeed.
indeed,
and
it
can
be
done
not
once,
but
twice.
and
it's
particularly
critical
here
because
what
the
judge--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--here's
the...
here's
the
consequence.
the
way
the
jury
was
picked
here,
they
questioned...
they
questioned
between
15
and...
generally
between
15
and
20.
one
week
they
got
to
30
jurors
because
they
were
doing
individual
voir
dire.
and
so
if
you
were
not
in
the
first
15
out
of
the
50
or
certainly
in
the
first
30
out
of
the
50,
you
weren't
going
to
be
questioned
at
all.
in
fact,
the
judge
told
them
at
the
outset,
that
if
they
were...
when
the
order
was
finally
set,
if
they
were
in
the
last
two
rows,
they
could
just
go
home
that
day
and
never
come
back.
and
so
the
consequence
of
shuffling
in
this
case
wasn't
the
consequence
you'd
have
if
you
had
50
jurors
picked...
this
is
a
capital
case.
we're
going
to
ask
all
of
you...
all
of
you...
questions,
and
it's
just
not
that
consequential
what
order
you're
in.
but
here
the
order
meant
everything.
if
you
could
get...
if
the...
if
the
prosecution
could
get
the
black
jurors
out
of
the
first
15
or
20
and
into
the
back,
they
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
the
disparate
questioning
or
exercising
peremptory
challenges.
and
the...
the
record
in
this
case
i
think...
it
doesn't
involve
an
admission
but
it
is
very,
very
strong
evidence.
i...
i
just
want
to
say,
before
sitting
down
for
rebuttal,
a
point
that
may
be
obvious,
but
it
is
surpassingly
important
for
this
court
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
batson
challenge.
there
are
many
areas
in
the
law
in
which...
in
which
this
court
delineates
the
contours
of
constitutional
doctrine
by
demonstrating
what
result
a
given
set
of
facts
yields.
and
so
too
batson's
abstract
rules,
its
doctrines
about
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
quantum
of
proof,
can
also
only
be
demonstrated
and
meaningfully
elucidated
by
a
model.
this
is
the
kind
of
area
like
voluntariness,
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
first
amendment
actual
malice
in
which
this
court
can
and,
i
submit,
under
(d)(2)
must
model
a
case
for
the
state
courts
and
the
lower
federal
courts
to
show
what
quantum
of
evidence
is
sufficient
to
require
a
conclusion
that
a
trial
court's
acceptance
of
a
prosecutor
as
batson's
avowed
reasons
are
objectively
unreasonable.
and
i'll
please
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
i
just
have
six
short
rebuttal
points
to
correct
the
record.
the...
while
the
graphic
script
was
given
at
the
beginning
of
the
voir
dire
and
therefore
based
only
on
the
questionnaires,
the
minimum
punishment
ploy...
that
is,
trying
to
trick
jurors
about
minimum
punishment...
was
done
at
the
very
end,
after
they
had
all
of
the
evidence.
and
therefore,
the
relevant
universe
of
whites
who
expressed
hesitation
is
not
10,
as
the
state
says,
but
19.
and
in
any
event,
even
with
10,
they
are
three-and-a-half
times
as
likely.
with...
also,
we
did...
the
trial...
the
defense
lawyers
in
this
case
objected
over
and
over
and
over
again
to
trying
to
trick
these
black
jurors
by
asking
them
what
minimum
punishment
they
would
give
without
expressing
the
number.
the
voir
dire
is
replete
with
this.
with
respect
to
the
graphic
script,
which
did
come
at
the
beginning,
well,
the
state
now
says,
well,
we
don't
have
the
questionnaires
for
all
the
people,
so
we
don't
really
know
how
many
there
were.
we
know
that
we
used
the
graphic
script
with
three
of
them.
okay.
the
three
that
they
used
that
they
identified
are
jurors
27,
59,
and
68.
two
were
excused
by
agreement,
and
one,
number
68,
was
seated.
but
we
do
know
what
the
juror
questionnaires
were...
i'm
just
doing
a...
sort
of
a
quick
list
on
the
back
of
my
note
card
here...
for
mr.
vickery,
ms.
mazza,
mr.
gutierrez,
mr.
hearn,
and
mr.
duke.
mazza,
who
is...
who
features
prominently
here
and
who
is
not
included
in
their
10,
said
in
her
questionnaire,
it
depends
on
the
crime.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
is
that--
