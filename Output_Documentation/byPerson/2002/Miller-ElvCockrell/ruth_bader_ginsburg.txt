ms.
bunn,
how
do
you
define--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is...
i
think
on
your
numbers
there
were
10
white
venire
members
and
10
black
who
expressed,
on
the
questionnaire,
hesitancy
about
the
death
penalty.
but
of
those,
there
were
only
two
of
the
white
jurors
who
got
the
graphic
script
and
there
were
i
think
eight
of
the
black.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
did
say
that
there
were
that
number
10--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
the
whites
who
expressed
hesitancy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
graphic
script
and
the
minimum
punishment.
that
never
came
up
before
the
trial
judge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
bunn,
if...
if
it
begins
and
ends
with
the
prosecutor's
neutral
reasons,
then
you
would
never
have
a
successful
batson
challenge
because
the
prosecutor
could
always
give
a
neutral
reason.
and
the
question
that
is
troubling
me
is
what
in
the
end
did
the
court
consider
and
look...
and
the...
and
the
state
trial
court
said,
well,
he
would
take
that
so-called
swain
evidence
for
what
it
was
worth.
he
never
told
us.
he
never
said
how
he
resolved
the
question.
and
the...
the
fact
finding
seemed
to
be
going
at
these
jurors,
the
black
jurors,
against
whom
peremptories
were
exercised,
one
by
one
and
saying
as
to
each
one,
there
was
a
neutral
reason
given
and
that's
it.
we
don't
know
how
anything
else
figured
in
this
package.
we
don't
know
whether
the
judge
said,
well,
i'll
take
it...
take
the
swain
evidence
for
what
it's
worth...
did
he
say
he
thought
it
was
worthless?
he
doesn't
tell
us.
we
don't...
we
just
can't
tell
from
this
record
what
went
on
at
that
stage
three.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
some
absences
in
the
finding,
and
let
me
go
back
to
the...
the
judge
saying,
i'll
reserve
the
question
whether
to
give
that
pattern
and
practice
evidence
any
weight.
and
then
we
haven't
got
a
clue
how
he
resolved
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
if
he
ever
even
came
back
to
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he...
he
said
he
was
going
to
decide
whether
he
was
going
to
give
it
any
weight.
maybe
he
made
a
decision
that
he
shouldn't
give
it
any
weight,
and
maybe
that
was
wrong
or
right.
but
we
just
don't
know.
