how
do
we
know...
how
do
we
know
he
didn't
look
at
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
before
you
get
to
the
jury
shuffle,
how
long
before
the...
the
voir
dire
in
this
case
had
the
newspaper
article
surfaced?
and
there
were,
i
guess,
two
sitting
judges
who
had
once
been
prosecutors
and
they
said,
well,
we
had
a
manual
that
we
work
with.
could
there
be
an
argument
that
that...
that
the
last
indication
that
the
manual
was
being
used
was
5
years
before
this
trial?
or
is
there
evidence
that
it
was
being
used
right
up
to
the
time
of
the
voir
dire?
could
you
tell
me
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
trial
was
'85?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
the...
that
the
court
finds
that
the
explanations
given
by
the
prosecutors
in
each...
prosecutor
in
each
case
were
completely
credible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
conclusion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
the
jurors
actually
then
reseated
or
are
they
just
called
in--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--everybody
gets
up
and
moves
and
the
back
people
get
in
the
front,
the
front
people
get
in
the
back.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
five
of
those
jurors
are
white
and
five
of
those
jurors
are
black.
but
with
the
five
black
jurors,
the
questioning
was
qualitatively
and
quantitatively
different.
it
went
on
much
longer
with
much
more
searching,
a
different
script.
what
result
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
were...
you
were
on
the...
the
theme
saying
that
the
hearing
was
conducted
properly
2
years
later,
and
i
don't
want
to
get
you
off
of...
of
that.
but
at...
at
some
point
just
answer
this
question,
and
maybe
it's
consistent
with
the
two...
the
hearing
you're
about
to
describe.
mr.
waxman
told
us...
and...
and
he's
fair
about
these
things...
that...
that
you've
walked
away
from
number
6,
that
there
was
no
disparate
prosecutorial
examination.
but
you
started
your
argument
by...
by
indicating
that
the
answers
were...
were
sufficient
to...
to
support
that.
are
you
saying
that
there
was
disparate
examination
but
that
it
was
justified?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
of
the
answers
that
they
gave
on
the
questionnaire
and...
and
answers
that
they
gave
just
before
the
script
was
used.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
would
say
then
that
you
haven't
walked
away
from
finding
number
6?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
why...
why
isn't
this...
you're
candid
to
say
that
you
may
have
erred
on
this
one
regard,
but
why...
why
isn't
this
a...
a
very
significant
fact
to
which
we
must
give
great
weight,
especially
you
indicated
the
evidence
was
circumstantial.
a
little
bit
odd
for
a
prosecutor
to...
to
say
that
circumstantial
evidence
isn't
important.
this
is
all
we
have
in...
in
these
cases
when
we're
trying
to
infer
motive,
and
best
evidence
is
often
circumstantial.
and
why
isn't
the
historical
evidence
here
overwhelming
circumstantial
evidence
and
good
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
the
credibility
finding,
which
is
number
2,
doesn't
prevent
us
and...
and
really
shouldn't
prevent
a
court
from
determining
whether
that
credibility
finding
has
a
foundation.
and
if
you
have
this
very
persuasive
historical
evidence,
the
different
script,
that
all
bears
on
whether
the
credibility
finding
can...
can
withstand
scrutiny.
you
can't
just
say,
well,
he
concluded
credibility
and
that's
always
for
the
trial
judge
and
then
walk
away
or,
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
you'll
never
have
a
batson
challenge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
absent
a
finding
that
the...
the
prosecutor
is
dissembling
based
on
demeanor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
1986,
two
dallas
county
assistant
district
attorneys
in
a
state
criminal
trial
used
preemptory
strikes
to
exclude
ten
of
the
eleven
african-americans
eligible
to
serve
on
the
jury,
and
that
jury
tried
the
petitioner,
thomas
joe
miller-el.
during
the
ensuing
17
years,
petitioner
has
been
unsuccessful
in
establishing
that
his
conviction
and
his
death
sentence
must
be
vacated
because
the
jury
selection
procedures
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
holding
of
this
court
in
batson
versus
kentucky.
the
claim
now
arises
in
a
federal
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
united
states
district
court
determined
that
petitioner
failed
to
establish
a
constitutional
violation
warranting
habeas
relief
and
after
losing
in
the
district
court,
the
petitioner
wanted
to
appeal
but
federal
statutes
require
before
that
appeal
can
be
taken
that
an
appellant
judge
issue
a
certificate
of
appealability
and
in
this
small
universe
of
the
law,
that
is
called
a
coa.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
denied
a
coa
and
that
denial
is
the
subject
of
our
decision
today.
we
have
no
difficulty
concluding
that
a
coa
should
have
issued.
the
critical
question
in
the
case
is
the
so-called
third
step
of
the
batson
analysis
and
that
is
asking
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
has
proved
purposeful
discrimination
and
this
in
turn,
depends
on
the
persuasiveness
of
the
prosecutorial
justification
for
the
preemptory
strikes.
that
issue
often
comes
down
to
whether
the
trial
court
finds
the
prosecutors
raised
neutral
explanations
for
the
strikes
were
credible.
credibility
can
be
measured
by
among
other
factors,
the
prosecutor’s
demeanor,
by
how
reasonable
or
how
improbable
the
explanations
were,
and
by
whether
the
prefered
rationale
had
some
basis
in
accepted
trial
strategy.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
presented
extensive
evidence
that
the
prosecutor’s
justifications
might
not
be
credible.
statistical
evidence
alone
raises
some
debate
as
to
whether
the
prosecution
acted
with
a
race-based
reason
when
striking
prospective
jurors.
the
prosecutors
used
their
preemptory
strikes
to
exclude
91%
of
the
eligible
african-american
venire
members
and
only
one
served
on
the
petitioner’s
jury.
in
total,
ten
of
the
prosecutor’s
fourteen
preemptory
strikes
were
used
against
african-americans.
happenstance
is
unlikely
to
produce
this
disparity.
we
questioned
the
court
of
appeals
the
dismissive
and
strained
interpretation
of
the
petitioner’s
evidence
of
disparate
questioning.
petitioner
argues
that
the
prosecutor’s
sole
purpose
in
using
disparate
questioning
was
to
elicit
response
from
the
african-american
veneri
members
that
reflected
an
opposition
to
the
death
penalty
or
an
unwillingness
to
impose
a
minimum
sentence,
and
this
is
more
than
a
remote
possibility.
disparate
questioning
did
occur,
and
in
our
view,
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
record
on
this
threshold
examination
in
the
coa
analysis
is
that
the
prosecutor’s
designed
their
questions
to
elicit
responses
that
would
justify
the
removal
of
african-americans
from
the
veneri
panel.
another
concern
is
a
text
of
practice
known
as
a
jury
shuffle,
and
this
procedure
permits
parties
to
rearrange
the
orders
in
which
the
member
of
the
veneri
are
examined
so
as
to
increase
the
likelihood
that
visually
preferable
members
will
be
moved
forward
in
the
room
and
empaneled,
and
with
no
information
about
the
prospective
jurors
other
than
their
appearance,
the
party
requesting
the
procedure
literally
shuffles
the
juror
cards
and
the
venire
members
are
then
reseated
in
the
new
order,
and
jurors
who
are
shuffled
from
the
front
to
the
back
of
the
panel
are
less
likely
to
be
questioned
or
to
serve
on
the
panel.
we
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
the
use
of
the
jury
shuffle
is
a
matter
of
further
concern
in
all
the
circumstances
of
this
case
as
set
forth
in
the
opinion.
finally
in
what
we
again,
emphasize
is
just
a
threshold
examination,
we
accord
some
weight
to
petitioner’s
historical
evidence
of
racial
discrimination
by
the
district
attorney’s
office.
it
reveals
that
the
culture
of
the
district
attorney’s
office,
at
least
in
a
period
before
the
case
was
tried,
was
suffused
with
bias
against
african-americans
in
jury
selection.
this
evidence
of
course
is
relevant
to
the
extent
it
casts
doubt
on
the
legitimacy
of
the
motives
underlying
the
state’s
action
in
this
particular
case.
to
secure
habeas
relief,
petitioner
must
demonstrate
that
the
state
court’s
finding
of
the
absence
of
purposeful
discrimination
was
incorrect
and
he
must
demonstrate
that
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
he
must
also
show
that
the
corresponding
factual
determinations
of
the
district
court
were
objectively
unreasonable
in
light
of
the
record
before
the
court.
state
represents
to
us
the
petitioner
will
not
be
able
to
satisfy
his
burden
and
that
may
or
may
not
be
the
case.
it
is
not,
however,
the
question
before
us.
the
coa
inquiry
asked
only
if
the
district
court
decision
was
debatable.
our
threshold
examination
convinces
us
that
it
was.
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
