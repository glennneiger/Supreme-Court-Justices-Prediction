justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
think
that
the
trial
judge,
therefore,
considered
the
issue
of
disparate
questioning.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
then
the
question
is,
if
they
considered
it,
did
he
reach
a
reasonable
conclusion?
what
about
justice
ginsburg's
mentioning
there
were
at
least
eight
white
jurors
who
also
expressed
reservations
who
were
not
given
this
graphic
description
of
what
the
death
penalty
involves,
but
instead
were
just
asked
could
you
find
against
a
person
if
that
meant
the
death
penalty?
what
about
those
eight
people?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
particular
thing
is
what
she
asked
and
you
say
right
now,
i
think
correctly,
that
the
trial
judge
did
consider
disparate
questioning.
you
also
agree
that
i
guess
it
was...
the
number
was
approximately
8
of
the
11
black
jurors
who
expressed
doubts
about
the
death
penalty
were
asked
this
very
graphic
question,
could
you
find
a
person
guilty
and
give
him
the
death
penalty
where
that
meant
taking
him
in
the
gurney,
et
cetera.
only
two
white
jurors
were
asked
that
question.
yet,
i
take
it
that
you
concede
that
there
were
at
least
eight
other
white
jurors
who
also
expressed
doubts
about
the
death
penalty
who
were
not
asked
that
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you
say
there
weren't
eight
such
people.
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
that's
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
have
another
question
which
i
think
is
to
me
more
important,
which
is
that
these
ambiguous
answers,
a
difficult
question
about
what
the
motive
was
of
the
prosecutor
in
peremptorily
striking
when
he
has
a
legitimate
reason,
to
decide
whether
it's
legitimate
or
not,
i
would
have
thought
history,
in
terms
of
how
the
county
has
behaved
in
general,
would
be
highly
relevant
to
characterize
and
decide
a
difficult
question
like
that.
but
on
page
911
of
this
record,
the
magistrate
makes
pretty
clear
that
he
thought
history
was
not
relevant
in
reviewing
that
third
part
of
batson,
reviewing
what
the
state
did.
and
the
state
court
judge
himself
said
on
page
844
i
guess
whether
or
not
i
will
give
it...
i
mean
such
evidence...
any
weight
is
another
question,
and
never
referred
to
it
again.
so
in
respect
to
that,
what
is
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
we
have...
in
essence,
we
still
have
a
group
of
three
busy
judges
who
are
reviewing
a
magistrate
reviewing
a
record.
the
record
is
controversial
at
best.
the
magistrate
uses
the
wrong
standard
concededly.
and
they
don't
even
issue
a
certificate
of
appealability.
well,
shouldn't
they
at
least
have
done
that?
