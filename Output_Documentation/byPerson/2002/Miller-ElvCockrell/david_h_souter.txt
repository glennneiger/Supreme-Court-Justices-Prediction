justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
did
say,
didn't
he,
when
he
admitted
the...
as
you
pointed
out,
when
he
admitted
the...
the
newspaper
article,
that
he'd
take
it
for
what
it
was
worth?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
which
is
something
you
could
have
put
in
i
presume,
the
state
could
have
put
in,
if...
if
it
had
thought
it
had
relevant
evidence
at
that
point,
and
it
didn't.
so
don't
we
have
to,
in
effect,
make
our
judgment
based
on
the
figures
that
justice
ginsburg
has
just
mentioned?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the...
if
the
prosecution
brought
it
up,
it's...
i
assume
it's
there
for
us
to
get
into
it,
and
we've
got
to
get
into
it
on
the
record
that
was
made.
and
if
the
prosecution
didn't
make
a
further
record
on
that,
it's...
it's,
it
seems
to
me,
appropriate
for
us
to...
to
look
into
the
issue
on
the
record
that
we
have.
and
if
we
do,
we
come
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
numbers.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
but
those--
justice
david
h.
souter
why--
--isn't
the
fact
that
we
are
having
this
colloquy
with
you
about
the
significance
of
the
numbers
a
pretty
good
argument
for
the
proposition
that
at
least
reasonable
jurists
might
disagree
about
the
significance
of
it,
and
therefore
there
should
have
been
a...
a
certificate
of
appeal
issued
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
on...
i'm
not
talking
now
about
the...
the
ultimate
resolution
of
it
which
mr.
waxman
addressed.
i'm
just
addressing
the...
kind
of
the
threshold
question
of
whether
there
should
have
been
a
coa
here.
and
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
your
argument
is
saying
that
unless
the
defense
has
got
just
a
slam
dunk
batson
argument
at
the
end
of
the
day,
there
shouldn't
be
a
coa,
which...
which
perhaps
reflects
what
the...
the
court
below
was
doing
when
it
seemed
to...
to
say
that
there
wasn't
going
to
be
a
coa
because
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the...
the
batson
claim
was
not
meritorious.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't...
isn't
the
degree
of
deference
and
the
significance
of
that
degree
of
deference
with
respect
to
specific
claims
something
that
is
worthy
of
being
determined
in
the
appellate
process
rather
than
something
that
ought
to
be
determined
at
the
threshold
before
the
appellate
argument
has
even
been
made?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
regardless
of
what
the
petitioner
may
have
said,
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
i
mean,
aren't
you...
aren't
we
making
out
a
pretty
good
case
again
by
our
colloquy
here
for
the
fact
that
there
was
something
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
here
on
the...
on
the...
the
reasonable
disagreement
among
jurists
standard?
