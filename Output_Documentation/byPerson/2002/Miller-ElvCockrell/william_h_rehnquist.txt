we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
01-7662,
thomas
joe
miller-el
v.
janie
cockrell.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now
you...
you...
mr....
mr.
waxman,
you've
got
two
presumptions
going
against
you
here:
the...
the
first,
the
hernandez
presumption
that
the
trial
court
has
to
be
deferred
to,
and
then
the
aedpa
presumption.
so
i...
i
hope
you'll
take
those
into
account.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly
demeanor
could
play
a
part
in
that
even
though
you
don't...
you
don't
say
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
he's...
he's
prejudiced
against
the
government
and,
you
know,
perhaps
the
way
he
answered
questions
may
give
you
a
reason
to
think
that,
that
the
transcript
doesn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at...
at
what
stage,
mr.
waxman?
you
say
this
was
2
years
after
the
actual
trial?
there
was
a...
a
state
habeas
proceeding
or
something?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying...
are
you
saying
that
the
prosecutor
on
voir
dire
must
ask,
when
he
gets
to
the
question
of,
you
know,
how
do
you
feel
about...
must
ask
the
same
questions
to
every
juror?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
wait
a
minute.
you
say
when
they
do
ask
the
same
questions
and
they
ask
them
in
a
way
that's
acknowledged
to
be
different,
that
seems
like
a
contradiction
just
starting
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
good.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
concede
that
would
be
legitimate,
that
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
was
the...
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
prosecution
in
asking
about
what
they
thought
the
minimum
penalty--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
is...
what
is--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
might
it
not
be
a
justification
there
that
more
black
jurors
showed
hesitancy
about
the
death
penalty
than
the
white
jurors?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
it
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
the
consequences
of,
quote,
reshuffling
the
order?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
waxman.
ms.
bunn,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
waxman,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-7662,
miller-el
versus
cockrell
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
