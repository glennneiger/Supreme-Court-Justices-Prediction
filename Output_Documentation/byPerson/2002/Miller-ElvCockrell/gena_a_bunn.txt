ms.

a.
bunn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
prosecutors
in
this
case
exercised
their
peremptory
challenges
to
remove
prospective
jurors
whom
they
believed
were
biased
against
the
state,
a
belief
based
not
on
stereotypical
assumptions
but
on
the
views
actually
expressed
by
these
jurors
during
voir
dire.
the
trial
judge,
who
observed
firsthand
the
entire
voir
dire
process,
credited
the
prosecutors'
race-neutral,
case-related
reasons
for
the
strikes.
the
judge's
findings
of
no
purposeful
discrimination
are
fully
supported
by
the
record
and
they
are
entitled
to
deference
in
this
court.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
is
circumstantial
evidence
of
some
kind
of
disparate
treatment.
if
those
are
the
facts,
if
these
jurors
had...
had
expressed
very
similar
or
equivalent
views
on
the
death
penalty
in
their
juror
questionnaires
and
then
were
treated
differently
by
the
prosecutors,
that
would
be
circumstantial
evidence
of
disparate
treatment.
it
is
evidence
that
is
not
in
existence
in
this
case,
however.
first,
petitioner's
attempts
to
make
comparisons
with
white
jurors
are
not
supported
by
the
record.
they
do
not
have
equivalent
views,
and
in
any
event,
to
the
extent
that
disparate
questioning
happened,
it
was
certainly
based
on
the...
the...
either
in
the
case
of
the
graphic
script
questioning
based
on
the
jurors'
responses
to
questions
on
the
questionnaires
or
in
the
case
of
the
minimum
punishment
question...
questioning
on
a
combination
of
the
responses
in
the
questionnaires
and
the
responses
to
questioning
in
the
voir
dire.
so
that
would
be
circumstantial
evidence,
but
it
is
not
present
in
this
case.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true
and
that's
supported
by
the
record
in
this
case.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes,
your
honor.
every
prospective
juror
who
was
questioned...
with...
with
the
exception
of
one
white
juror,
every
juror
questioned
in...
with
the
graphic
script
at
the
outset
of
the
questioning
had
expressed
some
level
of
opposition
to
the
death
penalty
in
their
juror
questionnaire.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
well,
perhaps
following
up
with
it.
now,
that
particular
juror...
i
believe
you're
referring
to
edwin
rand...
had
no...
there
was
no
indication
on
his
questionnaire
of
opposition
to
the
death
penalty.
that's
why
the
prosecutor
did
not
lead
off
with
the
graphic
script
for
mr.
rand.
however,
after
responses
like
that
and
then
the
response
of
mr.
rand
that
he
didn't
know
if
he
could...
maybe
today
he
could
impose
the
death
penalty,
but
tomorrow
maybe
he
couldn't,
after
that
kind
of
questioning,
then
the
prosecutor
did
lead
up
further
along
in
the
examination
with
a
semi-graphic
script,
but
certainly
not
at
the
outset.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
well,
your
honor,
first
off,
that's
not...
that's
not
precisely
true
according
to
the
record.
we
did
list
in
a
footnote
10
white
jurors
who
had,
at
some
point,
expressed
hesitancy
about
the
death
penalty.
however,
unfortunately,
we
do
not
in
a
sense
have
a
complete
record
because
the
juror
questionnaires
of
the
white
jurors
are
not
in
the
record
in
this
case.
defense
counsel
at
trial
only
presented...
offered
into
the
record
the
juror
questionnaires
of
the
african
american
jurors.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
who
at
some
point--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
who
at
some
point
in
their
examination
expressed
hesitancy
about
the
death
penalty.
but
we
don't
know
of
those
jurors
who
had
expressed
hesitation
about
the
death
penalty
in
their
initial
questionnaire.
by
example--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--well,
your
honor,
the...
for
one
thing,
defense
counsel
never
raised
a
disparate
questioning
argument
before
the
trial
judge,
and
that's
where
the
state
would
have
put
that...
that
evidence
in.
and
if...
if
defense
counsel
felt
like
there
were
a
disparate
questioning
argument,
it
would
have
been
defense
counsel,
given
that
he
had
the
burden--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--the
defense
counsel
did
not
argue
at
all
the
issue
of...
of
disparate
questioning.
the
state...
the
prosecution
brought
it
up
as
a
factor
to
consider
and...
and
argued,
as
we
have
argued
here,
that
the
state
certainly
did
use
different
lines
of
questioning
from
different
jurors
based
on
their
views
but
not
on
race.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
well,
again,
your
honor,
the...
the
record
in
this
case
doesn't
support
those
numbers
also
because
we
can
look
to
an...
as
analogy
to
the
african
american
jurors,
several
of
whom
did
not
express
hesitation
about
the
death
penalty
in
their
initial
juror
questionnaire
but
who
came
back
later
on
in
their
examinations
and
did
make
comments--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--they
were...
they
were
numbers
that
we
set
forth
in
talking
about...
in
discussing
the
disparate
questioning,
jurors...
white
jurors
who
had
at
some
point
expressed
hesitancy
about
the
death
penalty.
however,
to
infer
from
those
numbers
that
it
was
that
universe
of
jurors
who
the...
who
the
prosecutors
had
to
consider
their
juror
questionnaires
in
determining
whether
at
the
outset
to...
to
use
the
graphic
script,
that
is
not...
that
is
not
how
we
intended
the
footnote.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
well,
in
some
instances
the
prosecutor
did
both
with
african
american
and
white
jurors,
jurors
who
initially
in
their
juror
questionnaires
did
not
indicate
any
opposition
to
the
death
penalty,
but
into
their
question...
into
their
voir
dire
examination
did,
and
there
are
instances
where
the
prosecutor
did
go
into
the
graphic
script
later
on
in
the
examination.
but
that
is
not
what
the
petitioner
is
relying
on
here.
he--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--well,
your
honor,
given
the
level
of
deference
that
the
trial
judge's
findings
were
entitled
to
in
this
case,
we
do
not
think
that
it...
it
presents
that
kind
of
case
regardless
of
the--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--well,
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
the
court...
the
court
below
correctly
determined
that
no
coa
should
issue
in
this
case
given
the
multiple
levels
of
deference
that
the
trial
judge's
findings
were
entitled
to,
not
only
the
hernandez
standard--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--petitioner
has...
has
never
argued
that
he
was
not
able
to
make
any
level
of
detailed
argument
in
this
case
in
the
court
below.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
if
the
issue
were
looked
at
de
novo,
the
issue
alone
of
batson,
then
yes,
it
presents
compelling
evidence
both
ways.
however,
in...
viewed
to
the
scheme
of
2254(d),
it
is,
as
you
referred
to,
a
slam
dunk
case.
and
petitioner
did
not
meet
the
coa
burden,
and
that
is...
our
position
is
that
the
court...
court
below
correctly
denied
coa
given
the
deference
entitled...
that...
that
the
trial
judge's
findings
were
entitled
to
in
this
case.
and
getting
back
to
the
trial
judge's
findings,
just
a
few
things
that
we
disagree
with
the
petitioner
about
in
characterizing
the
trial
judge's
handling
of
this
case.
first,
the
fact
that
technically
the
batson
hearing
was
conducted
2
years
after
the
trial,
that
is
true.
however,
when
you
look
at
the
record
of
voir
dire
in
this
case,
though
it
was
pre-batson,
when
defense
counsel
raised
an
objection
to
the
strike
of
an
african
american
juror,
the
prosecution
came
forward
with
his
race-neutral
reasons
immediately,
contemporaneous--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--every
case
where
defense
counsel
objected
to
the
strike
of
that
particular
juror.
and
that
is
true
with
every
juror
challenged
here
with
the
exception
of
mr.
joe
warren.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
again,
your
honor,
the...
the
trial
judge...
the
trial
judge's
comments
to
the
juror
don't...
certainly
don't
vitiate
the
prosecutor's
reasons
for
striking
him.
but
nonetheless,
defense
counsel--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--defense
counsel
didn't
object
to
the
striking...
the
prosecutor's
striking
of
that
juror.
certainly
there
was
nothing
even--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--he
objected--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--that
is
true.
but
he
did
in
this
case...
defense
counsel
did
in
this
case
object
to
the
striking
of
every
single
african
american
juror
with
the
exception
of
joe
warren
and
paul
bailey.
so
he
was
not
using
a
running
objection
kind
of
conduct.
he...
he
specifically
objected
to
8
of
the
10
african
american
jurors
struck.
and
for
whatever
reason,
he
did
not
object
to
the
prosecutor
striking
joe
warren.
while
this
doesn't
give
rise
to
a
procedural
default,
it
could,
in
fact,
be
an
indication
that
defense
counsel
thought
there
were
legitimate
reasons
for
the
prosecutor's
strike
of
joe
warren.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes,
your
honor,
that's
what
we're
saying,
and
that
is--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--yes,
your
honor.
it's
the
state's
position
now--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--no,
your
honor,
we
have
not.
it...
it's
the
state's
position
now.
it
was
the
state's
position
at
the
time
of
the
batson
hearing
that
any
disparate
questioning
was
a
legitimate
means
to
deal
with
jurors
who
had
expressed
different
views
on
different
issues
but
was
not
based
on
race.
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
trial
judge's
finding.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
well,
again,
disparate
questioning,
like
many
other
pieces
of
evidence
that
petitioner
is
relying
on
in
this
case,
are
circumstantial
evidence
of...
of
discriminatory
motive
or
can
be
in
a
given
case.
assuming
that
there...
that
there
was
some
level
of...
of
disparateness,
even
within
those
jurors
who
had
expressed
views
about
the
death--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--well,
i
do
not
concede
that
to
the
extent
that
it
is
identifying
those
jurors
as
being
jurors
who
expressed
doubts
about
the
death
penalty
in
their
juror
questionnaires,
and
that
is
the
information
that
the
prosecutor
had
to
go
by.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
the
state's
view
is
that
while
the
federal
magistrate...
first
i'll
address
the
federal
magistrate's
handling
of
the
issue.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
the
federal
magistrate
did
err
in
its
elucidation
of
the
standard
of...
its
holding
basically
that
historical
evidence
is
irrelevant
at
batson's
third
step.
however,
certainly
an
error
by
a
federal
magistrate
does
not
entitle
a
petitioner
to
habeas
corpus
relief.
and...
and
any
error
as
well
was
cured
when
the
fifth
circuit
considered
independently
all
of
the
evidence
that
petitioner
had
presented
in
his
petition.
moving
on
to
the
trial
judge,
however,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--justice
kennedy,
it
is
evidence.
it
is
circumstantial
evidence.
but
the
trial
judge's
inquiry
and
certainly
an
appellate
court's
inquiry
must
begin,
must
key
in
on
the
reasons
that
the
prosecutors
struck
these
jurors
and
the
record
in
this
case.
and
in
this
case,
prosecutors
struck
prospective
jurors
for
legitimate,
case-related,
race-neutral
reasons.
that's
where
the
trial
judge's
analysis
began
and
ended,
and
it
overruled
the
state's
objections
to
the
pattern
and
practice
evidence
on
relevancy
grounds.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
well,
respectfully
i
disagree.
the
trial
judge
found
the
prosecutor's
reasons
to
be
credible,
and
in
making
that
credibility
determination
and
having
overruled
the
state's
objections
to
this
pattern
and
practice
evidence
and
stating
candidly
that
he
didn't
know
what
weight
he
was
going
to
give
it,
given
that
while
it
is
circumstantial
evidence,
he's
got
a...
he's
got
a
record
here
where
the
prosecutor's
reasons
are
supported.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
we
are
not--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--we
are
certainly
not
arguing
that
a...
a
batson
finding
from
a
trial
judge
is
completely
insulated
from
appellate
review.
however,
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
the
reasons
credited
by
the
trial
judge
are
supported
by
the
record,
there...
there
is
no
basis
to
overrule
the
trial
judge's
credibility
determination.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
however,
in
the
context
of
the
batson
hearing
that
he
was
resolving,
that
finding
is
reasonably
understood
as
a
finding
that
there
was
no
disparate
questioning
based
on
race.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
the
finding
regarding
disparate
questioning
i
believe
is
phrased
as
disparate
questioning
of
the
challenged
jurors.
so
given
that,
i
would
say
that,
yes,
that
supports
the
interpretation
certainly
that
it
was
made
within
the
context
of
the
batson
challenge
and
that
the
finding
was
limited
to
based
on
race.
there
was
no
disparate
questioning
based
on
race.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
i
would--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--i
believe
that
those
sorts
of
notations
were
made
on
the
juror
questionnaires
rather
than
the
juror
information
cards.
and
i...
i
would
agree
with
mr.
waxman
that
the
record
does
indicate
that
those
notations
were
made
toward
the
beginning
of
the
process,
prior
to
any
individual
questioning.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
not
on
the
juror...
the
juror
information
cards.
that
sort
of--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--that...
that
was
all
they
had
to
go
on
during
the
preliminary
phases.
when
they
received
the...
after
the...
the
panel
was
finally
seated,
when
the
jurors
were
given
the
questionnaires,
then
that's
what
the
parties
worked
from
in
making
more
notes
in
determining
which
to
challenge
for
cause
and
which
to
strike.
so,
again,
what
can
be
inferred
from
that
i...
i
think
is...
really,
it's...
it's...
there's
just
not
a
whole
lot--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
well,
your
honor,
again
it
is
our
position
that
on
this
record
a
certificate
of
appealability
was
not
warranted.
again,
given
the
multiple
levels
of
deference,
the
trial
judge's
clear
findings
in
this
case,
and
the
fact
that
they
are
supported
by
the
record.
and
again--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--well,
again--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--yes,
your
honor.
however,
it
was
clearly
before
the
trial
judge.
the...
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
consider
the
evidence,
nothing
besides
the
mere
absence--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--perhaps
he
did,
but
as
the
fact
finder,
that
was
his
prerogative,
and
the...
the
record
in
this
case...
again,
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
didn't
consider
the
evidence.
it
was
before
him
and
his
findings,
however,
properly
do
focus
on
the
record
in
this
case,
the
reasons
that
the
prosecutor
came
forward
with,
and
were
credited
by
the
trial
judge.
and
again,
the...
the
record
in
this
case
clearly
supports
those...
those
findings.
and
these
jurors
were
jurors
who
the
state...
both...
both
white
jurors
and
african
american
jurors
who
the
state
struck
were
jurors
who
had
expressed
views
that
the
state
was
uncomfortable
with.
and
again,
to
get
a
feel
for
what
the
prosecutor's
job
was
in
this
case,
they...
they
looked
at
ultimately
108
jurors,
individually
questioned
65
jurors,
and
the
prosecutor
had
to
view
that...
to
view
those
jurors
as
not
even
just
looking
at
do
you
believe
in
the
death
penalty,
yes
or
no,
but
where
does
this
particular
juror
fall
in
the
spectrum.
how
likely
are
they
to
be
able
to
consider
the
full
range
of
punishment
in
a
capital
murder
case?
that
was
what
the
prosecutor
was
charged
with
in
this
case.
and
if
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
it
supports
the
trial...
the
prosecutor's
reasons
for
the
legitimate
strikes
in
this
case.
they
were
supported
by
the
record.
they
were
case-related.
and
they
were
simply
not
based
on
race.
there
is
ample
support
for
the
trial
judge's
findings
and
simply
no
basis
to...
to
overrule
those
findings.
unless
there
are
any
more
questions.
