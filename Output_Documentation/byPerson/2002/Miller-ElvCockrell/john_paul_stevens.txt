mr.
waxman,
could
i
just
interrupt
to
ask
one
question?
when
were
those
notations
put
on
those
cards,
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
these
are--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
we
agree...
if
we
agree
with
your
analysis
of
number
6,
does
that
suffice
to
vitiate
number
2?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
ask
on
that...
that
question
that
if
the
different
script
was
based
on
concern
about
the
person's
attitude
toward
the
death
penalty,
would
it
not
be
true,
because
the
script
is...
comes
very
early
in
the
examination,
that
the
doubt
about
the
death
penalty
must
either
have
been
shown
in
the
written
response
questionnaire
or
something
said
right
before
that
script
took...
took
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it
is,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--now,
the
one...
may
i
just
follow
with
one
question?
now,
the
one
juror
who
said
there
were
four
categories
of
death
penalty
and
he
said
he
was
somewhere
between
one
and
two,
would
that
have
been
sufficient
to
justify
that
kind
of
script?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
true
in
every
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
for
example,
the...
joe
warren's
case
was
most
interesting
to
me
because
the
prosecutor
just
exercised
the
peremptory
without
any
explanation
whatsoever.
and
then
the
judge
made
quite
a
speech
to
the
juror
about
how
he
had
been
a
very
fine
juror,
and
that
was
sort
of
the
end
of
it.
and
then
later
on,
we
find
out
that
he
was...
he
was
not
a
very
fine
juror.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
prosecutor
did
not
give
a
reason
for
striking
that
juror.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
i
understand
it,
the
defense
counsel
had
a
kind
of
a
running
objection
and
made
clear
in
each
record
when
a
black
juror
was
stricken.
the
record...
he
made
it...
that
be
made
part
of
the
record.
but
he
didn't
object
on
a
juror-by-juror
basis.
he
didn't
have
any
standing
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
this
was
a
swain
hearing
rather
than
a
batson
hearing
at
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that's
not
true
as
to
finding
6,
because
he
didn't
find
there
was
no...
there
was
justification
for
disparate
questioning.
he
found
there
was
no
disparate
questioning.
and
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
that
there
was
disparate
questioning.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
read
literally,
it's...
if
read
literally,
it's
clearly
incorrect.
and
of
course,
as
to
the
findings
on
credibility,
there's
no
finding
as
to
any
particular
juror.
he
just
made
a...
a
gross
finding
that
everybody...
i
believe
everything
the
prosecutor
said.
basically
that's
what
he
found.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
ask
one
question
about
the
procedure?
were
the
juror
information
cards
that
have
the
notations
about
sex
and...
and
race
noted
on
it...
when
do
you
think
those
notations
were
made?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i
find
it
significant
there
are
no
notations
or
very
few
as
to
attitude
toward
the
death
penalty,
which
is
your...
your
key
to
everything.
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
card
on
which
the
prosecutor
said
soft
on
death
or
hard
on
death
or
anything
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
it
would
be
fair
to
infer
that
the
prosecutor
on
each
juror
noted
race
and
sex,
but
did
not
note
attitude
toward
death
penalty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which...
which
were
cards
prepared
before
the
voir
dire
examination
began.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
one
thing
that's
clear
is
they
did
note
the
race
of
every
juror
before
they
questioned
them.
that
much
is
clear.
