justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
at
least
in
some
of
the
circuits,
i'm
not
sure
in
the
cases
of
this
court,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
i
thought
that
in
trademark
infringement
cases,
that
the
circuit
court
said
that
they
have
certain
de
novo
authority.
historical
facts
are
clearly
erroneous,
but
the
conclusions
that
you
draw
from
the
historical
facts
give
them
certain
powers
of
de
novo
review.
that's
the
prevailing
rule
in
many
of
the
circuits,
is
it
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
infringement
cases,
and
shouldn't
that
same
rule
be
applied
here?
i
mean,
judges
have
the
capacity
in
the
trademark
area,
i
should
think,
to
know
what
dilution
is
or
is
not
if
we
have
certain
historical
facts.
i
don't
know
why
you
need
to
survey.
the
bugwiser-budweiser
example.
i
mean,
you
don't
have
to
be
too
tricky
a
judge
to
figure
out
that
this
is
very
harmful.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
does
tarnishment
fit
the
language
of
the
statute?
that's
what--
--yes,
i'd
like
to
know
that,
too.
i
don't
see
how
tarnishment...
you
know--
--does
that
lessen
the
capacity
of
the
mark
to
identify--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
thought
it
just
changed
the
reaction
to
the
mark,
rather
than
lessening...
i
mean,
you
know,
you
have
an
unfavorable
reaction,
rather
than
not
knowing
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
have
to
add
the
word
quality
to
the
statute.
yes.
the
statute
doesn't
contain
that
word.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
was
concerned
about
the
tarnishment
aspect,
and
i
still
have
to...
i
would
like
you
to
comment
on
the...
on
justice
ginsburg's
example,
too,
would
it
diminish
the
capacity
of
the
victoria's
secret
mark
to
identify
its
line
of
goods
if
some...
somebody
thought
they
also
sold
men's
pajamas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
moseley
against
victoria's
secret
catalogue,
no.
01-1015.
in
1995,
congress
amended
cection
43
of
the
trademark
act
of
1946
to
provide
a
remedy
for
the
dilution
of
famous
marks.
that
amendment
known
as
the
federal
trademark
dilution
act
describes
the
factors
that
determine
whether
a
mark
is
distinctive
and
famous
and
defines
the
term
"dilution"
as
the
lessening
of
the
capacity
of
a
famous
mark
to
identify
and
distinguish
goods
or
services.
the
question
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
is
whether
objective
proof
of
actual
injury
to
the
economic
value
of
a
famous
mark
as
opposed
to
a
presumption
of
harm
arising
from
a
subjective
likelihood
of
dilution
standard
is
a
requisite
for
relief
under
the
statute.
petitioners,
victor
and
cathy
moseley
own
an
operate
a
retail
store
named
victor's
little
secret
in
a
strip
mall
in
elizabethtown,
kentucky.
they
sell
a
variety
of
products
including
women's
lingerie
and
adult
novelties.
respondents
are
affiliated
corporations
that
own
the
victoria's
secret
trademark
and
operate
over
750
victoria's
secret
stores,
two
of
which
are
in
louisville,
kentucky,
a
short
drive
from
elizabethtown.
in
1998,
they
spent
over
$55
million
advertising
lingerie
bearing
the
victoria's
secret
trademark.
they
brought
this
action
alleging
the
petitioner's
use
of
the
name
victor's
little
secret
in
a
store-handling
tawdry
merchandise
was
likely
to
blur
and
erode
the
distinctiveness
and
tarnish
the
reputation
of
the
victoria's
secret
trademark.
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
likelihood
of
confusion
between
the
marks
but
held
that
the
two
marks
were
sufficiently
similar
to
cause
dilution
and
enjoined
petitioner
from
using
the
name
victor's
little
secret.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
expressly
disagreeing
with
a
case
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit
involving
barnum
&
bailey's
claim
that
the
use
by
the
state
of
utah
of
the
phrase,
the
"greatest
snow
on
earth"
on
its
license
plates
diluted
the
value
of
the
phrase
"the
greatest
show
on
earth."
the
fourth
circuit
had
held
that
the
statute
requires
proof
that
the
junior
mark
not
only
gave
rise
to
a
mental
association
with
the
senior
mark
but
also
cause
some
actual
harm
to
the
famous
mark's
economic
value.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict.
our
examination
of
the
text
of
the
statute
convinces
us
that
it
does
require
proof
of
actual
dilution
rather
than
just
a
likelihood
of
dilution.
in
the
language
of
the
act,
there
must
be
evidence
of
a
"lessening
of
the
capacity
of
the
mark
to
identify
and
distinguish
goods
or
services."
that
does
not
mean
that
the
plaintiff
must
prove
an
actual
loss
of
profits
or
sales,
but
as
the
facts
of
the
utah
case
demonstrate,
the
mere
fact
that
consumers
mentally
associate
one
mark
with
another
does
not
necesarrily
prove
that
there
has
been
any
reduction
in
the
capacity
of
a
famous
mark
to
identify
the
goods
of
its
owner.
there
being
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
this
case
of
actual
harm
to
victoria's
secret
mark.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
