mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
constitutes
dilution,
other
than
the
abstraction
of
the
statutory
definition
perhaps
is
reflected
a
bit
in
the
examples
we've
given
of
consumer
surveys
that
might
be
used
to
produce
evidence
in
a
case
of
this
nature.
if
consumers
were
asked
what
products
do
you
associate
with
the
name
victoria's
secret,
and
those
who
were
aware
of
victor's
little
secret
answered
it
substantially
differently
and
included
items
found
only
in
that
store
and
not
in
victoria's
secret
stores,
or
what
attributes
do
you
associate
with
victoria's
secret,
and
those
aware
of
victor's
secret
were
more
apt
to
say
tasteless
rather
than
tasteful,
which
would...
might
be
the
response
from
those
familiar
with
victoria's
secret.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it...
it
might.
all
of
these...
i
mean,
we
don't
take
the
position
that
a
consumer
survey
is
necessary
in
order
to
prove
a
case
in
the
first
place,
but
i
think
the
way
a
survey
would
be
designed
and
what
the
answers
would
show
is
illustrative
of
what
constitutes
dilution.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
unless
their...
a
conclusion
could
be
drawn
based
on
other
factors
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--a
mark
had
established
a
certain
distinctiveness
that
is
associated
only
with
the
particular
mark,
and
now
that
is
being
blurred.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
only
under
the
federal
dilution
statute
of
'95
if
the
mark
is
a
famous
mark,
and
in
the
toro
case
that
we
cite,
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
not
automatically,
but
if--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
would
involve
an
exact
replication
of
the
mark,
which
are
the
only
examples
given
in
the
house
report
or
in
the
legislative
history,
such
as
kodak
pianos.
most
of
the
cases,
however,
are
about
similar
marks
rather
than
exact
replications,
and
those
are
much
more
problematical
to
ascertain
whether
there
is
the
kind
of
effect
we're...
the
act
is
concerned
with.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
very
difficult.
we
don't
say
that
a
survey
is
needed.
there
are
other
factors
that
are
looked
to,
including--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes.
dilution
is
about
dilution
of
the
famous
mark
and
its
capacity
to
distinguish
the
particular
goods
or
services,
but
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
saying
that
mere
mental
association
of
the
two
marks
by
consumers
automatically
results
in
dilution.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
the...
the
question
is
not
do
you
think
of
victor's,
but
when
you
think
of
victoria's,
do
you
think
of
more
than
what
victoria's
secret--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--itself
has
as
its
merchandise
and
image.
is
their
name
now
associated
with
a
different
type
of
product
that
may
change
their
renown
or
cachet
with
customers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don't
believe
that
in
itself
constitutes
dilution
if
there
is
none
of
the
damage
to
the
ability
of
the
mark.
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
yes...
no,
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
think
the
fourth--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
fourth
circuit
case
of
ringling
brothers
was
very
illustrative.
people
might
associate
utah's
use
of
greatest
snow
on
earth
with
ringling
brothers'
use
of
greatest
show
on
earth,
but
if
they
keep
the
two
distinct
in
their
minds,
even
though
they
recognize
that
it's
a
play
on
the
same
words,
but
they
think
the
trademarks
refer
to
different
products
and
services,
then
there...
no
harm
is
done
to
ringling
brothers
as
the
fourth
circuit
held,
and
the
fourth
circuit
even
suggested
that
perhaps
they
even
benefit
from
having
people
think
additionally
of
their
mark.
that's
a
question
on
which
the
patent
and
trademark
office
has
not
taken
a
view,
but
the
harm
has
to
be
that
consumers
are...
are
diminished
in
their
capacity
to
recognize
the
mark
that
is
the
famous
mark
that's
being
protected.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
true,
at
least
when
it's
an
identical
mark,
or
one
that's
so
confusingly
similar--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there...
there
has
to
be
confusion
as
to
the
mark,
rather
than
as
to
the
source
of
the
product.
