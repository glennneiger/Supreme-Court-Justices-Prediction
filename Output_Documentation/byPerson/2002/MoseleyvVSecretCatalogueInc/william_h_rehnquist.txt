we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
01-1015,
victor
moseley
and
cathy
moseley
doing
business
as
victor's
little
secret
versus
v.
secret
catalogue,
inc.--
mr.
higgins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--of
economic
consequence,
and--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
many
consumers
do
you
need?
you
say
one
isn't
enough,
and
you
say
general
consumer
perception.
i
mean,
if
you
had
20
people
would
that
be
enough?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
was
asking
you
a
particular
question.
would
20
be
enough?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
do
you
ask
these
consumers?
how
many
kodaks
are
there?
is
that
what
you
want
to
ask
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that...
most
consumers
wouldn't
even
understand
that
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
sounds
like
a
lawyer's
dream.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why...
why
isn't
there
a
public
interest
in
not
having
some
organization
like
yours
simply
copy
another
person's
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
congress
has
gone
further
here
and
said
you
can't
simply
copy
someone
else's
name.
now,
you
say
there's
no...
maybe
congress
shouldn't
have
done
it,
maybe
it
hasn't
done
it,
but
to
say
there's
no
public
interest
at
all
on
that
side
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
me.
i
mean,
you...
you
don't
come...
your
client
doesn't
come
off
well
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
very
well,
mr.
higgins.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
wallace,
our
records
reflect
that
this
is
your
157th
argument
before
the
court
in
the
34
years
you
have
been
an
attorney
in
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general.
some
years
ago,
you
eclipsed
the
20th
century
record
of
140
arguments.
i
understand
that
you
will
soon
retire
from
government
service,
so
on
behalf
of
the
court
i
extend
to
you
our
appreciation
for
your
many
years
of
quality
advocacy
and
dedicated
service
in
the
solicitor's
office...
solicitor
general's
office...
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
that
doesn't
mean
we're
going
to
rule
in
your
favor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

you,
mr.
wallace.
