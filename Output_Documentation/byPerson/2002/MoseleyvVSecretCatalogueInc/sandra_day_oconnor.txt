well,
do
you
say
that
actual
confusion
is
relevant
to
the
dilution
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it's
not,
in
your
view,
relevant
to
the
dilution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
this
case,
the
other...
the
lanham
act
was
thrown
out,
in
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
say
that
actual
confusion
doesn't
matter,
then,
for
purposes
of
this
statute,
the
dilution
statute,
or
it
could?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
now--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
what
about
actual
economic
harm?
is
that
a
requirement,
in
your
view,
under
this
statute--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
the
plaintiff?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
statute
does
not,
in
defining
dilution,
speak
in
terms
of
economic
harm,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean,
just
using
the
name?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
likelihood
of
dilution
enough?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
it
causes
dilution
for
everybody--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
dellinger,
why
isn't
it
useful
to
think
in
terms
of
whether
there's
proof
of
some
diminution
of
value
of
the
mark?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you...
you
wouldn't
think
we
should
just
presume
a
diminution
in
value,
would
you,
because
the
mark
is
similar?
