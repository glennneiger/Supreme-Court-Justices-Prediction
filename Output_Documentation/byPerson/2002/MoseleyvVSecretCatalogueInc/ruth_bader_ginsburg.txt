justice

that's
the
best
evidence.
that's
the
best
evidence,
but
let's
go
back
to
what
is...
causes
dilution?
one
can
distinguish
what
the
patent
and
trademark
office
does.
that
is,
it
considers
marks
before
they're
in
use,
so
one
might
say,
oh,
the
distinction
between
causes
dilution
and
likely
to
cause
is,
likely,
you're
looking
at
the
thing
before
it's
ever
used.
once
it's
used,
you're
into
the
causes
territory.
that
would
be
a
nice
clean
line
to
say
that
all
that
it
means,
all
that
the
difference
in
phraseology,
causes
dilution
as
opposed
to
likely
to
cause,
is,
did
it
have...
a
causation
case,
you
have
to
have
a
junior
mark
that's
in
use,
so
why
isn't
that
a
satisfactory
line
between
what's...
what
causes
dilution
as
opposed
to
what
is
likely
to
cause
dilution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
well,
that's
likely
to.
they
can't
judge
it,
because
it's
not...
it's
not
in
use.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
asking
you,
getting
out
of
that
territory,
it
can
look
at
things
before
they're
in
use,
and
now
that...
now
the
junior
mark
is
in
use,
why
isn't
that
enough
to
satisfy
the
dilution
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
because
those
are
names
that
are
generic,
like
apple.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
kodak
pianos?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
dupont
shoes,
or
buick
aspirin?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
is
evidence...
or,
at
least,
how
did
this
all
get
started?
someone
sees
victor's
secret
and
writes
to
victoria's
secret
and
says,
you
want
to
stop
these
people,
so
we
know
that
one
consumer,
although
he
wasn't
confused,
said,
they're
diluting
your
mark.
now,
suppose
you
had
12
of
those
who
said,
yeah,
i
passed
this
shop,
victor's
secret,
and
i
thought
immediately
of
victoria's
secret.
would
that
proof
be
sufficient
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
may
i
ask
you
something
to
clarify
the
government's
position
on
this?
as
i've
been
listening
to
the
argument,
mr.
higgins
says
you
look
to
see,
he
said,
if
before
you
thought
there
was
one
victoria's
secret,
now
you
thought
there
were
two.
he's
suggesting
that
the
association...
it's
not
what
you
think
of
when
you
see
victor's
secret.
when
you
see
victor's
secret,
of
course
you're
going
to
think
of
victoria's,
but
what
counts
is,
when
you
think
of
victoria's
secret,
do
you
think
of
victor's.
that's...
that's
what
dilution
is,
and
if
it's
the
latter,
then
it's...
those
are
two
very
different
things,
aren't
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
going
on,
when
you
think
of
victor's
you
think
of
victoria's.
i'm
asking
you,
is
the
right
question...
is
the
necessary
question
of
the
customers...
when
you
think
of
victoria's,
do
you
think
of
victor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
differentiate
between
cadillac
and
chevrolet,
do
you?
chevrolet
would
have
just
much
cachet--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
dellinger,
can
i
just
clarify,
then,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
this
particular
shop
happens
to
sell
sex
toys.
it
could
just
as
well...
victor's
secret
could
sell
men's
underwear
and
your
argument
would
still
be
the
same,
am
i
right?
so
we
get
out
the
tawdriness
or
the
disparagement
or
the
tarnishment.
it's
just...
it's
a
store,
it
sells
underwear,
men's
underwear,
and
it's
got
the
label,
victor's
secret.
