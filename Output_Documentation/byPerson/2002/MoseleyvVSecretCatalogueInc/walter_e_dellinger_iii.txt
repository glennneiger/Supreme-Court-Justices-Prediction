mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
on
which
the
court
granted
certiorari
was
whether
the
plaintiff
must
demonstrate
that
it
has
already
suffered
economic
injury
as
a
precondition
to
any
and
all
relief
under
the
1996
act.
the
text
of
the
act
answers
that
question,
and
answers
it
no.
there's
simply
no
such
requirement
included
in
the
statute.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
scalia,
we
agree
that
the
act
requires
a
showing
of
actual,
present
dilution,
and
that
such
a
showing
was,
in
fact,
made
below.
what
is
dilution?
a
number
of
you
have
asked
that
question.
it's
best
understood
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
very
narrow
statute
that
only
protects
a
few
very
famous
marks.
i
do
not
think,
for
example,
justice
scalia,
that
delta
would
qualify
as
a
famous
mark
because
it
has
been
used
so
often
in
other
third
party
uses.
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--then
it
would
not
suffer
the
disqualification
that
would
come
as
to
what
is
present--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--about
proliferating
uses.
whether
it
would
otherwise
satisfy
that
would
remain
to
be
seen.
i
think
that
the
court
can,
and
the
courts
can
narrow
the
application
of
this
statute
by
taking
very
seriously
the
requirement
that
it
has
to
be
a
truly
famous
mark
that
has.
take
the
example
that
was
given
to
the
house--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
don't
know--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--on
those
facts.
i'd
have
to
know
whether,
if...
as
it
is
today,
yes,
i
would
think
if
it--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--if
they're
not
sure
who's
the
source
of
the
product,
it
may
be
infringement,
and
the
reason
i
resist
the
use
of
delta
is
that
a
lot
goes
into
a
determination
of
whether...
as
it
did
in
this
case...
as
to
whether
a
mark
has
those
special
qualities
that
mean
that
the
second
or
junior
user
and
the
third,
fourth,
and
fifth
are
lessening
its
capacity
to
communicate
these
very
distinctive
ideas.
the
example
used
in
the
house
report
was
tiffany's,
for
example.
we
all
know
that
if
another
jewelry
store
starts
as
tiffany's
you've
got
an
infringement
claim,
because
consumers
would
be
confused,
but
as
the
house
was
told,
what
about
a
tiffany's
restaurant,
and
that
means
that
tiffany's
used
to
stand
for
one
thing,
it
now
stands
for
two,
but
here's
the
absolute
heart
of
the
matter,
where
the
fda
comes
into
play.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
have,
and--
[laughter]
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
there
may
be
no
difference.
i'm
assuming
that
both...
if
you
assume
that
both
delta
and
tiffany's
are
famous
marks.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
but
here's
why
delta
faucets
and
tiffany's...
if
the
original
marks
are
famous...
both
constitute
the
harm
of
dilution.
dilution--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--just
using
the
name--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
not
under
the
act,
and...
and
nor
is
just
using
the
name
enough,
nor
is
just
semantic
similarity.
you
have
to
make
out
the
statutory
proof
that
it
actually--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
causes
dilution,
and
dilution--
--is
expressed--
--it's
creating
a
mental
association.
similarity
is
not
enough.
but
take
an
example
that
shows
how
critically
important
stopping
the
first
use
is.
if
you
can
have
a
tiffany's
restaurant,
then
you
can
also
have
a
tiffany
shoe
store,
a
tiffany
pet
store.
very
soon
tiffany's
no
longer--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--where
will
it
all
end?
[laughter]
that
is
exactly--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--exactly.
the...
what
congress
saw
as
the
harm,
justice
breyer,
for
truly
famous
marks,
to
quote
from
the
house
report
itself,
is
that
dilution
applies
when
the
unauthorized
use
of
the
famous
mark
reduces
the
public's
perception
that
the
mark
signifies
something
unique,
singular,
or
particular,
so
that
rolls-royce,
which
once
stood
for
one
thing,
once
it's
on
100
products
or
1,000
products
no
longer
identifies
and
distinguishes--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--congress
determined
that
that
was
bad
to
the
extent
that
the
mark
no
longer
stood
for
something
singular
or
particular,
no
longer
conveyed--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
i
do
not...
it
is
not
at
all
the
case.
congress
made
it
clear
that
safe
harbors
were
to
extend
a
wide--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--and
it--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--if
you
lose
distinctiveness,
what
you
lose
is
the
selling
power
of
the
mark.
rolls-royce
stands
for
something
important.
it
conveys
something
that
consumers...
it
signals
to
consumers.
rolls-royce
is
very
careful
about
what
products
it
allows
to--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
scalia,
it
is...
when
you
look
at
whether
a
mark
is
famous...
and
in
this
case,
it's
simply
not
contested.
this
is
a
mark
that
comes
in
behind
levi's
and
ahead
of
rolex
on
the...
on
the
list,
but
when
you
contest
that,
you
do
look
at
a
number
of
factors,
so
you
can't
stand
here
and
pick
out
any
one,
and
that's
a...
that's
an
important
gatekeeping
function
to
narrow
this
statute.
now--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--not
just
that,
but
a
certain
mark
and
quality
and
kind
of
product
is
exemplified,
and
that's
what
makes
a
mark
famous.
it
gives
it
this.
now,
if...
we
know
that
these
marks
have
value.
when...
when
companies
are
acquired,
often
as
much
as
four-fifths
of
the
value
may
go
to
use
that
name.
that
is
something
quite
valuable,
justice
breyer,
and
its
value
is
going
to
be
lost--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--if
there
are
a
thousand
different
ones.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
there
is
no--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
believe
that
is
the
case,
justice
scalia,
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
i
think
they
would
be
on
similar
footing,
and
chevrolet
has
its
own
kind
of
appeal.
it
appeals
to...
for
those
of
us
who
live
in
nascar
country,
there
is
sometimes
a
more
appealing
image
to
chevrolet
than
to
cadillac.
i
don't
mean
to
make
value
judgments.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
a
very
good
question,
and
that
is
justice
breyer's
question
for--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--we
believe
that
obviously
the
mark
does
suffer
in
value
if
you
make
out
the
finding
of
dilution.
the
fourth
circuit
would
require
you
show
actual--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
but
what
you...
what
you
presume
is
that
the
economic
injury
that
you're
talking
of
may
not
be
identifiable...
often
would
not
be
identifiable...
until
it's
too
late
to
rectify
the
harm
that
has
been
done.
if
you
think
of...
we
usually
use
as
examples
where
there
is
one
other
competing
user.
what
faces
the
sort
of
in-house
intellectual
property
counsel
for
a
company
with
a
famous
mark
is
that
there
are
users
popping
up
all
over
the
country
all
of
the
time,
so
that
if
the
first
user,
say
victor's
little
secret,
exists
in
elizabethtown,
kentucky,
and
if
you
can't
show
that
that
alone
produces
the
kind
of
harm
you're
looking...
or
that
your
question
would
imply
one
might
be
looking
for...
how
can
you
stop
the
second,
the
third,
the
500th
use?
at
what
point...
there's
no
privilege
for
the
first
user,
so
that
by
the...
here's
what
would
happen.
by
the
time
you
could
show
economic
damage
to
the
harm,
first
of
all
as
a
matter
of
law
you
might
have
lost
the
status
as
a
famous
mark
because
there
are
all
those
users
out
there.
secondly,
the...
it
is
not
clear
why
you
would
prohibit
the
500th
user
of
the
mark,
the
500th
different
kind
of
store
when
you
allowed
the
first
499
to
go
on,
so
that...
you
ask
the
question
of
whether,
at
present,
this
use
lessens
the
capacity
of
that
mark
to
identify
and
distinguish.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
i
think
this
case
is
a
very
good
example,
because
you
have
a
court
which
goes
through
a
list
of
factors
to
reach
a
conclusion.
the
opinion
is
rather
short,
but
that's
because
the
conclusion
in
this
case
is
so
close
to
being
a
core
example
of
the
statute.
they...
they
mention
the
fact
that
it's
a
very
distinctive
mark,
the
degree
of
similarity,
the
proximity
of
the
product
lines
helping
to
create
that
association,
the
shared
customers...
39,000
catalogues
distributed
in
elizabethtown.
the
suggestion
is
there
are
some--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
there
are
39,000
victoria's
secret
catalogues
distributed
in
elizabethtown,
kentucky
in
1998.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
a
good
question,
but
i...
four,
he
says,
but
i
think
that's
his
guess.
we
don't
know.
i--
[laughter]
i...
i...
think
it
is
substantial.
now,
once
you
have
these
other
uses
out
there,
particularly
if
it's
a--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--absolutely,
just
as
i
think
you
could,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--what
you
have
to--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
because
here
you
have...
here
you
have
an
actual
association.
what
you
have
in
this
case,
for
example,
that
the
judge
relies
upon,
is
not
a
survey.
it's
proved
by
actual
consumers.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
breyer,
congress
simply
did
not
agree
that
no
harm
has
been
done
when
the
famous
mark
loses
its
singularity,
and
remember,
if
there
can
be
one
store
under
victoria's...
under
victor's
little
secret
in
elizabethtown,
kentucky,
there
can
be
a
thousand
opening
the
monday
after
superbowl
sunday.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
it's...
your
example
is
that
there
is
a...
you're
suggesting
a
mere
mental
association.
i'm
not
sure
your--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--secondly,
i
am
not...
by
no
means...
it
would
take
a
lot
to
persuade
me
that
it
floats
is
a
truly
famous
mark
deserving
of
this
protection,
but
congress
believed
that
the
harm
is
that
if
you
have
a
mark,
and
congress
identified
marks
like
buick
aspirin,
but
if
you...
the
very
harm
congress
sought
to
prevent
is,
when
a
mark
stands
for
one
thing...
this
narrow
set
of
truly
famous
marks...
and
you
have
replicating
uses,
it
is
no
longer
going
to
stand
for
anything
in
your
mind,
and
congress
believed,
and
the
market
reflects,
that
that
is
a
true
loss.
now,
if
you
wait
to
try
to...
to
where
you
could
show,
as
the
fourth
circuit
would
require,
an
actual
revenue
loss,
you
can't
unring
the
bell,
particularly
with
tarnishment.
if
someone
opened
up--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
entirely
agree
with
that.
we
do
believe
that
the
dilution
of
the
victoria's
secret
name
through
blurring
would
be
sufficient,
but
in
this
case,
you
don't
have
to
rely
upon
that,
because
the
court
below
did
find
that
there
was
tarnishment
when
a
name
not
only
ceases
to
stand
for
one
thing,
but
is
associated--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes,
it
does,
and
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--let
me
just
quote
you
from
the
treatise,
one
sentence
from
the
mccarthy
treatise.
one
of
the
classic
functions
of
a
trademark
is
to
signify
that
all
goods
and
services
sold
under
the
mark
are
of
equal
quality,
or
of
a
special
quality.
that
is
part
of
identifying
and
distinguishing
a
mark.
it...
the
capacity
is
lessened.
it
lessens
the
capacity
to
identify
and
distinguish
a
particular
mark
when
that
mark
is
tarnished
by
what
the
trial
court
found
some
customers
would
find
to
be
an
unsavory
association.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
scalia,
i
think
you're
misstating
the
statute.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it's
not
whether
you
can
identify
and
distinguish.
it's
whether
the
mark's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--capacity
to
identify
and
distinguish
is
lessened,
and
if
it
no
longer
stands
in
one's
mind--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--if
it
no
longer
stands
in
one's
mind,
or
in
the
mind
and
the
public
perception
for
the
same
connotation
of
quality
as
it
did
before
the
association
with
the
unsavory
image,
its
capacity
to
identify
and
distinguish
that
quality
has
lessened,
but
moreover--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
statute
uses
dilution,
justice
stevens,
as
a
term
of
art,
and
nothing
could
be
clearer
than
that
congress
thought
that
term
of
art,
dilution,
encompassed
both
blurring
and
tarnishment,
as
i
think--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
may
not
persuade
justice
scalia--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
it...
congress
thought
otherwise.
the
house
report
says
that
the
definition--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
and
the
definition
of
lessening
the
capacity
encompasses
that,
but
in
any
event,
since
blurring
is
still
present,
this
is
thought
to
be
an
easy
case
by
the
courts
below,
for...
for
good
reason.
if
you
imagine
hundreds
of
different
users
of
the
victor's
little
secret
mark,
the
uniqueness,
the
quality,
the
public's
perception
is
going
to
be
lessened.
congress
further...
to
go
back
to
a
question
asked
by
justice
breyer...
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
it
wanted
the
safe
harbors
read
as
broadly
as
possible
to
ensure
that
there
was
no
restriction
on
first
amendment
rights,
so
the
courts
are
warmly
invited
to
create
as
large
a
safe
harbor
for
parody.
this
is
a
case
in
which
we
have
blurring,
we
have
tarnishment,
which
is
a
near
subset
of
blurring,
but
the
courts
below
looked
at
the
direct
customer
testimony.
colonel
baker,
the
judge
advocate...
staff
judge
advocate
at
fort
knox...
looks
at
a
victor's
little
secret
ad
in
the
base
newspaper
and
writes
off
to
victoria's
secret
and
says,
they're
using
your
name
in
an
unfavorable
way.
his...
his
deposition
testimony
remarks--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
someone
else,
i
think
you
well...
you
begin
to
have
the
elements
of
the
proof
of
dilution
when
you
show
that
someone
is
using
the
same...
or
a
name
which
reaches
mental
association
because
of
a
number
of
factors.
you
have
the
elements
of
dilution.
you
might
not
yet
have,
as
you
have
proof
in
this
case,
of
a
really
lessened
capacity
to
identify
and
distinguish.
now,
another...
the...
nobody
sought
to
introduce
a
survey
in
this
case.
i
would
trust
federal
judges
more
than
sociology
graduate
students
to
make
this
kind
of
determination,
and
nobody
sought
to
bring
before
this
court
a
fact-bound
determination
of
whether
all
of
the
judges
below
were
correct
when
they
found
that
there
was
a
strong
association,
and
beyond
that,
that
the
use
of
the
victor's
little
secret
mark
to
sell
the
kinds
of
goods
it
sells,
which
some
customers
find
unsavory,
and
which
mr.
moseley
himself
testified
some
members
of
the
public
find...
at
least...
extremely
offensive,
that
that
has
the
effect
of
lessening
the
capacity
of
a
victoria's
secret
mark
to
identify
and
distinguish
those
famous
goods
and...
and
products,
and
that's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it...
it
only
affects
the
fact
that
it
doesn't...
no
longer
singularly
stands
for
anything,
that
if
rolls-royce
were
on
100
different
products,
it
would
no
longer...
it
would
no
longer
mean
anything,
and
would
no
longer...
they
might
as
well
call
their
car
a
yugo
if
it's
used
on
products
hither
and
yon.
tarnishment
is
a
particular
good
example
of
why
the
lessening
itself
needs
to
be
remedied,
because
once
you've
tarnished
a
product,
it's
hard
to
unring
that
bell
in
the
public's
mind,
if
someone
had
a
national
program.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
tarnishment
has
generally
been
restricted
so
far
in
the
case
law
to
more
unsavory
associations,
sex,
drugs,
and
matters
of
that
kind.
this
is
an
act
which
is
more
limited
than
its
critics
suggest.
they...
of
course,
whether
it
was
a
bad
policy
was
a
matter
that
should
have
been
addressed
to
congress,
but
it
can
be
limited
to
a
few
very
famous
marks.
a
safe
harbor
is
read
broadly.
people
can
use
the
term,
victoria's
secret,
for
any
purpose
they
want
in
parody
and
commentary,
on
the
steps
of
the
courthouse.
they
just
can't
make
this
one
use
of
it,
that
is
a
commercial
use
in
commerce
that
lessens
the
capacity
of
that
mark
to
carry
out
its
function
that
congress
so
clearly
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
federal
trademark
dilution
act.
that's
why
i
think
the
courts
below
saw
this,
like
buick
aspirin
and
kodak
shoes,
as
a
core
paradigm
example
of
precisely
what
the
statute
was
designed
to
prohibit,
and
why
none
of
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--none
of
the
most
interesting
questions
arise.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
is
in
this
case,
justice
ginsburg,
where
the
sufficiency
of
that
i
think
was
really
not
challenged.
