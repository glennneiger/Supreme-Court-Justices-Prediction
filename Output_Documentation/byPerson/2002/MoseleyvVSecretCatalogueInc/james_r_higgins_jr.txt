mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
counsel:
we
are
here
today
to
obtain
a
construction
of
the
federal
trademark
dilution
act,
ftda,
that
will
keep
federal
trademark
law
in
its
proper
bounds.
we
submit
that
can
be
accomplished
by
choosing
objective
proof
over
supposition
and
inference
to
guide
future
ftda
cases.
this
case
from
the
sixth
circuit
involves
a
nonidentical,
nonconfusing
trademark
operating
in
the
remote
reaches
of
the
economy
that
was
nevertheless
enjoined
under
the
ftda,
and
demonstrates
the
dangers
of
an
unchecked
ftda.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
your
honor,
this
case
actually
came
from
kentucky,
and--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--i
suppose
that's
even
more
remote
than
tennessee
in
some
cases.
[laughter]
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
there
was
not
at
the
beginning
of
this
case.
the
closest
one
was
60
miles
away.
we
say
that
the
result--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--we
say
that
the
result
below
is
contrary
to
the
actual
words
that
congress
used
in
the
ftda,
namely
the
plain
words,
causes
dilution.
if
this
result
stands,
the
ftda
threatens
to
usher
in
an
anticompetitive
expansion
of
trademark
law
into
patent-like
realm.
perhaps
the
best
example
of
that
is
the
second
circuit's
nabisco
decision,
urged
in
part
here
by
respondents,
which
involved
a
goldfish-shaped
cracker,
and
it...
the
court
there
applied
the
ftda
to
grant
exclusionary
rights
in
an
unpatented,
uncopyrighted
design
of
a
product
to
enjoin
a
product
that
they
said
diluted.
that
is
contrary
to
this
court's
two
most
recent
decisions
involving
federal
trademark
law,
the
wal-mart
decision
and
the
traffix
devices
decision.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
there's
a
lot
of
people
who
want
explanation
of
what
dilution
is,
and
their
tarnishment
aspect
of
dilution
is
part
of
the
legislative
history.
it
is
not
expressed
in
the
words
that
congress
used
to
define
dilution.
congress
defined
dilution
as
the
lessening
of
the
capacity
of
a
famous
mark
to
identify
and
distinguish
the
goods
or
services
to
which
the
famous
mark--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--well,
it
could
identify
budweiser
beer,
but
the...
the...
our
point
about
this
case
is
that
there
needs
to
be
objective
evidence
that
consumers,
in
fact,
identify
the
accused
mark
with
the
famous
mark.
in
other
words,
we
say
that
section
43(c)(1)
of
the
ftda
in
its
words
causes
dilution,
imposes
a
causal
connection
between
the
accused
mark
and
the
beneficiary.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
okay.
the
injury
in
a
dilution
case
is
focused,
the
courts
agree,
on
the
selling
power
of
the
famous
mark
and
the
way
that
the
cases
go
is
that
everyone
agrees
that
that
selling
power
is
the
hook
that
the
famous
mark--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--the
question
becomes,
again,
one
of
consumer
protection.
all
of
that
is
tied
up
into
the
gist
of
the
ftda.
what
is
being
protected
is
the
selling
power
of
the
famous
mark...
which
the
fourth
circuit
in
ringling
brothers
referred
to
as
the
economic
value
of
a
trademark...
and
i
would
agree
with
you,
justice
breyer,
that
if
there
is
no
injury
there
should
be--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--it...
it
would
show
whether
or
not
consumers
would
now
identify
a
single
mark
with
two
different
sources,
and...
and
that
is
the
essence
of
what
trademark
dilution
by
the
circuit
court--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--the
theory
is...
with
which
we
don't
totally
agree...
the
theory
is
that
consumers
are
used
to
seeing
only
one
kodak,
and
now
they
see
two,
and
the
theory
is
that
that
is
the...
among
a
number
of
metaphors,
that
is
the
first
of
a
thousand
cuts
that
will
lead
to
harm.
now,
our
difficulty
with
that
is
that
not
every,
even
identical
use
of
the
same
trademark
ultimately
leads
to
the
dilution--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--actual
confusion
is
primarily
a...
a
lanham
act
infringement
concept.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
if
there
were
actual
confusion,
it
might
be
relevant,
but
this
case--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--that's
the
main
point
of
this
case,
is
that
the
court
has
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
these
accused
marks
by
our
clients
are
not
going
to
lead
to
confusion.
it
is--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--i
say
that
it
could
in
some
circumstances.
it's
not
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
we
think
that--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--we
think
that
the
plaintiff
in
a
dilution
case
needs
to
show
objective
proof
of
dilution,
and
that
necessarily
has
an
economic
component
with
it.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
the
statute
does
not
mention
economic
harm
per
se,
but
it
does
say,
the
lessening
of
the
capacity
of
the
famous
mark
to
identify
and
distinguish
and,
focusing
on
the
selling
power
of
the
mark,
we
say
the
best
evidence
that
would
be
adduced
in
a
case
of
dilution
is
surveys
of
consumer
perceptions
of
the
impact
of--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--we
think
that
is
not
a
completely
satisfactory
distinction
because
of
the
language
of
the
statute
that
authorizes
the
patent
and
trademark
office
to
look
at
a
mark
before
it
begins.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
and
the
statute
actually
says
that.
section--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--well,
we
would
agree
that
the
mark,
the
junior
mark
has
to
be
in
use,
but
we
would
not
agree
that
just
by
merely
using
a
mark
that
is
semantically
similar
to
the
famous
mark,
that
dilution
will
inevitably
result,
which
is
the
position
of
the
respondents
here.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
we
don't
suggest
that
we
have
to
prove
that
kodak
lost
sales.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
we
think--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--well,
first
of
all
we
believe
that
consumer
surveys
do
have
evidence
of
economic
impact,
and
we
don't
say
that
economic
damage
is
required.
that
takes
our
position
too
far.
the
actual
question
that
is
certified
is
whether
the
plaintiff
must
show
objective
evidence
of
harm
to
the
economic
value
of
the
famous
mark,
not
that
it
must
show
economic
harm
per
se.
i
realize
that's
subtle
distinction--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--i
don't--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--that
is
not
a
complete
economic
proof.
what
we
say
is
that
not
every,
even
identical
use
leads
to
dilution
in
the
minds
of
consumers.
think
of...
as
we
put
in
our
brief...
delta
airlines,
delta
faucets.
think
of
apple
records,
apple
computers.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
well
then,
how
about
ford
motor
company
and
ford
modeling
agency?
you
know,
that's
the
same
result.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
kodak
pianos
is
in
the
legislative
history
as--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--all
of
those
are
identical
marks,
and
we
say
that
this
case
presents
a
nonidentical
mark.
there
are
semantic
differences
and
there
are
gender
differences.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
we
say
it
is
not
sufficient,
because
the...
but
that
is
essentially
the
analysis
that
the
sixth
circuit
put
in
there.
the
sixth
circuit
said
at
page
27a
of
the
petition,
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
that
they
are
focusing
on
what
a
consumer
is,
quote,
"likely
automatically
to
think",
unquote,
and
then
link
that
to
the
famous
mark.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
what
our
position
is,
that
that
requires
a
court
to
guess
whether
the
association
that
the
consumer
thinks
of
is--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--what
we
would
like--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--we
want
the
plaintiff
to
show
that
there
is
objective
proof
of
consumer
perceptions
that
it
causes
dilution,
exactly
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
no,
that's
not
enough.
that's--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--dilution
consists
of
a
consumer's...
the...
general
consumers,
not
a
single
consumer,
but
general
consumer
perception
that
there
used
to
be
one
victoria's
secret
and
now,
in
their
minds,
there
are
at
least
two.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
well,
the...
the
record
and
the
briefs
reveal
some
articles
by
trademark
scholars
who
discussed--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
you
know,
this...
we
live
in
an
age
when
consumer
surveys,
voter
surveys,
public
opinion
surveys
are
done
over
a
weekend,
and
in
this
situation
that
is
the
kind
of
survey
that
we
would
suggest.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
you
ask
them
the
scientifically
designed
question.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
which
is,
you
know,
do
you
think
of
another
famous
mark,
and
do
you
believe...
as
the
law
review
article
suggests...
do
you
believe
such
things
as
whether
or
not
the
new
entrant
had
to
get
permission
from
the
famous
mark
in
order
to
market
this
product.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
and
that's...
that's
part
of
our
point,
your
honor.
if--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--we
do
not.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
as...
per
se.
what
we
say
is
that
there
is--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--because,
remember,
this
case
is
a
statute
that
is
wholly
different
than
the
common
law.
it
has
no
common
law
antecedent.
it
is
granting
property
rights
through
congress'
action
under
the
alleged
use
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
we
say
those
property
rights
that
are
being
granted
by
this
statute
create
rights
that
go
well
beyond
any
trade
area--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--we
did
mention
that
in
our
briefs,
but
the
primary
people
who
are
positing
that
position
here
are
the
amici,
who
represent
the
public
interest,
and
the
main
point
about
this
ftda
is
that,
other
than
bumping
up
against
the
first
amendment,
there
really
isn't
a
public
interest
that
is
being
expressed
or
applied
here.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
well,
we...
if
there
is
that
situation,
then
that
would
be
a
case
of
trademark
infringement
or
copyright
infringement.
this
case
does
not
involve...
this
case
does
not
involve--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--well,
there
is
a
public
interest,
but
that
is
addressed
primarily
on
the
free
speech
aspect
of
things.
we
would
agree
with
that.
the
problem
with
this
case
is
that
it
requires
courts
to
speculate
whether
the
beginning
of
a
semantically
similar
mark
is
going
to
inevitably
lead
to
dilution,
and
that's
contrary
to
the
words
that
congress
used.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
we
do
say
there
is
an
economic
component,
through
the
proof
that
we
suggest
be
required
under
the
causal
relationship
that
is
necessary,
and
the...
we
don't
abandon
the
economic--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--we--
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
--we
do
demand
that
the
plaintiffs
show
that
our
mark
is
harming
theirs
in
a
dilution
way,
that
it
does
lessen
the
capacity
of
that
mark
to
identify
and
distinguish
its
goods
or
services,
and
that's
best
done
by
consumer
surveys.
your
honor,
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
r.
higgins,
jr.
mr.
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
colonel
baker
was
ever
in
petitioner's
store,
and
his
particular
affidavit
was
challenged
and
disregarded
by
the
trial
court.
what
we
have
here
is
a
choice
between
two
standards
to
interpret
the
ftda.
our
choice
is
grounded
in
the
actual
use,
words
that
congress
used,
and
the
respondent's
position
is
grounded
in
the
academic
theory
of
dilution
which
we
say
is
way
ahead
of
the
law.
our
standard
is
objective
and
predictable.
theirs
is
subjective,
unpredictable,
invites
the
courts
to
substitute
its
own
judgment
for
consumer
perceptions.
it's
consistent
with
almost
nothing.
our
standard
focuses
on
measurable
consumer
perception.
theirs
focuses
at
the
beginning
on
semantic
similarity,
and
a
presumption
that
dilution
follows
from
that.
our
standard
merely
puts
the
famous
mark
owner
to
their
proof
to
show
that
congress'
words,
the
lessening
of
the
capacity,
has
been
established
as
a
matter
of
proof.
they
should
not
get
a
national
injunction
without
that.
our
standard
keeps
trademark
law
in
its
proper
bounds.
their
standard
merely
rewards
the
achievement
of
fame.
our
standard,
if
applied
in
this
case,
should
result
in
this
court
reversing
the
injunction
and
directing
that
the
petitioners
be
allowed
to
use
victor's
given
name
in
their
business.
thank
you.
