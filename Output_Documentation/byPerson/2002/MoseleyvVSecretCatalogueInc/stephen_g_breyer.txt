g.

before
you...
just
would
you
spend
one
minute...
it
would
help
me
a
lot
if
you
explained
to
me
what
dilution
is,
and
i'll
be
specific.
it
seems
to
me
what
you
have
here
is
a
case
of
what's
called
tarnishment,
and
what
tarnishment...
what
i
think
of
is
this,
is
it
like
this,
that...
that...
imagine
some
small
shop
wants
to
start
a
bug
spray
business.
it's
a
funny
example,
but
it
comes
from
an
actual
case,
and
they
decide
to
call
themselves
bugwiser
bug
spray,
and
their
slogan
is,
where
there's
life,
there's
bugs,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
budweiser
is
not
going
to
enter
the
bug
spray
business.
nobody
thinks
budweiser,
in
fact,
is
the
source
of
the
bug
spray,
but
budweiser
has
an
interest
because
the
people
who
see
this
ad
are
going
to
think
budweiser,
yuck,
and
they
don't
want
people
to
think
that.
now,
is
dilution
encompassed?
does
dilution
encompass
that,
and
my
reason
for
thinking
maybe
it
doesn't
is,
the
words
of
the
statute
refer
to
distinctiveness
of
mark.
they
don't
refer
to
tarnishment.
but...
is
it...
so
i
want
some
explanation
of
what
dilution
here
refers
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
believe--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
excuse
me,
before
you
go
back
to
cause,
which
is
your
main
point
which
i
want
to
hear,
i
do...
i'm
assuming
now
that
for
purposes
of
this
case
anyway,
you
concede
that
tarnishment
is
part.
if
you
don't
concede
that,
or
even
if
you
do,
will
you
please
explain
as
well
what
this...
what
it
is,
what
the
injury
is
where
you're
talking
about
a
lessening
of
capacity
to
identify
and
distinguish,
what
injury
is
that,
if
it
is
not
tarnishment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
then
please
explain,
putting
tarnishment
to
the
side...
there
is
no
tarnishment,
assume...
how
does
the
fact
that
you
have
a
tiny,
totally
separate
product
with
the
same
name
ever,
ever
hurt
the
selling
power
of
the
big
famous
name?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
don't
understand
conceptually
how
there
ever
could
be
an
injury.
i've
got
to
understand
that
first,
and
the
reason
is,
i
can
imagine
an
injury
through
tarnishment.
i
can
imagine
an
injury
where
the
big
product,
kodak,
intends
to
enter
the
small
area,
the
kodak...
whatever,
monkey
wrench...
and
it
is
intending
to
enter
and
draw
on
the
selling
power
of,
everyone
thinks
kodak
is
good,
so
i
can
think
of
those
two
things,
but
where
they
don't
intend
to
enter,
where
there's
no
tarnishment,
what,
in
principle,
is
the
harm
that
you
say
we
have
to
show
really
exists?
unless
i
know
what
that
is
in
principle,
i
can't
tell
if
you're
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
that
is
harmed
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
just
beyond,
i
would
have
thought
that...
you
don't
make
a
point
of
it,
so
i
might
be
wrong...
there's
a
pretty
significant
speech
interest
on...
on
your
side
of
the
case.
that
is,
if
this
statute
gets
out
of
hand,
advertising
is
part
of...
whether
we
like
it
or
not...
our
children's,
anyway,
daily
communications,
and
all
of
a
sudden,
if
there's
no
real
harm
you're
going
to
cut
off
what
people
can
say
in
commercial
contexts.
now,
you
don't
make
much
a
point
of
that,
so
don't
let
me
put
words
in
your
mouth.
explain
it
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there...
what
is
the
extra...
i'm
not...
if
you're
finished
with
that
question,
i'd
like
to...
which
i
think
there's
a
lot
to.
is...
what
is
particularly
the
harm?
is
it
just
that
the
customer
thinks...
either
customer...
thinks
of
the
other
even
if
there's
no
specific
tarnishment,
and
there's
no
general
tarnishment?
that
is,
people
associate
buick
with
a
good
car,
and
we
can
measure
whether
that's
identical
before
and
identical
after,
and
it
is,
so
there's
no
general
tarnishment,
there's
no
bug
example
tarnishment,
there's
nothing
but
the
fact
that
on
justice
ginsburg's
question,
both
sides
say
yes.
now,
is
that
harm
under
this
statute?
is
that
dilution,
or
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so...
so
the
ability
of
the
mark
consists
either
of
my
bug
example,
or
some
general
weakening
of
the
goodness
that
inheres
in
the
name.
anything
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
okay--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
answer's
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
so
what?
so
what?
i
mean,
i
don't
say
so
what
facetiously.
i
say
so
what
to
get
you
to
identify
the
harm
specifically
that
that's
likely
to
bring
about
to
the
first
owner.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
longer
identifies
one
thing.
it
now
identifies
a
thousand
things,
and
that,
of
course,
is
true
by
definition,
and
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
why
is
that
bad?
--congress
determined
that
that
was
bad
because--
just
automatically?
oh,
no,
go
ahead.
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
again,
that's
just
another
way
of
repeating
the
same
thing,
and
the
reason
that
i
think
it's
important
is,
perhaps
we
can
survive
with
only
having
one
tiffany's,
but
let's
think
of
some
slogans
out
of
my
youth,
you
know.
it
floats.
99
and
44/100th
percent
pure.
the
beforehand
lotion,
whatever
that
meant.
i'm
just
repeating
slogans
from
old
radio
programs,
and
the
reason
that
i'm
doing
it
is
because
i
want
you
to
see
immediately,
as
soon
as
you
depart
from
a
word
like
tiffany's,
which
is
totally
arbitrary
or
fanciful,
and
you
get
into
actual
advertising
slogans,
you
will
tie
up
free
speech
in
lawsuits
like
mad,
and
that's
what's
worrying
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
the
safe
harbor
is
fair
use.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fair
use,
and
that's
what's
again
worrying
me,
because
those
two
words,
fair
use
to
me
spell
lawyers,
lawsuits,
uncertainty
and
confusion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
why
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
not
require
some
proof
of
that?
that
is,
some
proof
that
this
mark...
which
not
only
identifies
a
wonderful
car,
but
now
has
come
to
stand
for
wonderfulness
in
general...
some
proof
that
because
somebody's
using
it
on
a
tricycle,
that
people
think
it's
a
little
less
wonderful.
now,
that's
not...
that's
hard
to
prove
one
way
or
the
other,
but
not...
i
mean,
requires
some
reason
for
thinking
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
you
can.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
suppose
right
here,
to
take
this
case,
that
the
people
who
go
to
victor's
who
have
ever
heard
of
it
honestly
do
not
believe
the
less
in
any
respect
whatsoever
of
victoria's
little
secret,
and
the
people
who
use
victoria's
little...
i
mean,
why
should
they
+/?
and
the
people
who
use...
go
to
victoria's
little
secret
have
never
heard
of
victor's,
so
you...
why...
why
suppose
they
come
in
and
show
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
why...
i
understand
you're
confusing
the
marks.
no,
you're
not
confusing
the
marks.
no.
i'm...
he's
saying
i'm
confusing
the
marks.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i...
did
i
have
it
backwards?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
people
who
go...
no,
the
customers
of
victor's
do
associate
victor's
with
victoria,
but
they
think
nonetheless
of
victoria.
they
might
even
think
more
of
victoria.
i
don't
know
what
they
think,
but
it's
not
negative
in
any
respect,
and
the
people
who
go
to
victoria's,
to
use
justice
ginsburg's
example,
don't
care,
or
don't
know,
or
they've
never
heard
of
victor's,
so
although
there
is...
in
a
subset
of
people...
an
association
of
the
name,
there
is
no
harm
of
any
sort
whatsoever,
and
they
will
prove
that.
should
they
not
have
the
opportunity
to
prove
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
in
your
view,
anyone
who
starts
going
around
for
a
commercial
reason
and
using
the
two
words,
it
floats...
it
floats...
where
they
want
people
to
think
of
ivory
soap,
they
are
open
to
a
lawsuit,
and
they
have
to
rely
on
a
fair
use
defense,
or
are
there
other
defenses?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
my
example
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
a
commercial
context...
in
a
commercial
context
where
people
are
polled--
