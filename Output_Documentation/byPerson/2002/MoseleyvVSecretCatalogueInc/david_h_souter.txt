justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
one
thing
i
think
you're
asking
for
beyond
justice
ginsburg's
example
is,
to
take
the
kodak
wrench
and
the
kodak
camera,
you're
asking
for
some
proof
that
somebody
heard
the
word
kodak
and
said,
was
it
the
camera
or
the
wrench
+/?
and
if
that
proof
exists
you've
got
your
objective
proof,
and
why
do
you
have
to
go
to
the
point
of
saying
that...
proving
that
kodak
lost
a
sale
as
a
result?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're...
you're
asking
for
proof
of
some
kind
of--
--that's
the
point
of
this,
for
heaven's
sake.
justice
david
h.
souter
--i...
that's
the
point
that
i
don't
see.
if
i
understand
it,
the
dilution
occurs
when...
or
that
dilution
is
the
process
of
lessening
the
capacity
of
kodak
to
identify
the
camera
rather
than
to
identify
the
wrench.
if...
if
it
is
shown
that
that
process
has
begun...
that
it
is
occurring...
why
do
you...
what
is
the
point
of
your
argument
that
it
has
got
to
be
carried
forward
to
the
point
of
an
economic
loss
of
some
sort?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
there...
under
the
terms
of
the
statute,
isn't
that
shown
simply
by
the
fact
that
the
consumer
stops
for
a
second
and
says,
is
it
the
camera,
or
is
it
the
wrench
when
the
consumer
hears
the
word,
kodak?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
further
proof
of
loss
of...
what
further
economic
proof
is
required
to
come
within
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the
answer
was
simply,
i'm
not
sure
any
more?
would
that
show
that
dilution
had
occurred?
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
what
about
the
first
time
it
was
used
either
for...
what
is
it,
the
airline,
and
what's...
faucets?
whichever
came
first.
what
about
the
first
time
it
was
used
for
the
second
product?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's...
and
keep
it
so
i
can
understand
it.
let's
assume
the
first
use
was
delta
airlines.
everybody
recognizes
delta
airlines.
somebody
starts
advertising
delta
faucets.
was
delta
airlines
famous
enough--
justice
david
h.
souter
--on
your
criterion?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let's
assume
it's
famous
enough.
the
ads
start
going
out
in
the
magazines
for
delta
faucets.
there
is
no
proof
that
delta
airlines
has
suffered
any
tangible
damage
at
this
point,
but
there
is
proof,
let's
assume
from
a
survey
of
magazine
readers,
that
when
they
see
the
word,
delta,
standing
by
itself,
they're
not
sure
who
the
source
of
the
product
is.
is
that
dilution?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
difference
between
tiffany's
restaurants
and
delta
faucets
is
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
what
do
i...
would
this
be
appropriate
for
a
summary...
would
you
urge
me
to
take
this
on
summary
judgment?
justice
david
h.
souter
not
little...
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
blurring,
then,
that
you're
describing
now
has
no
quality
component
to
it?
that
only
comes
when
you
get
to
the
subset?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
if
you're
dealing
with
rolls-royce,
i
suppose
virtually
any
blurring
is
also
going
to
be
tarnishment,
which
you
don't
necessarily
have
even
in
other
famous
marks.
