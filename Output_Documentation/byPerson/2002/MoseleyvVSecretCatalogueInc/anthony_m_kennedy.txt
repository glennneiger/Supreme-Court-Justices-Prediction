m.

you
mean
tennessee
is
remote,
or
this
particular
business
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
well,
kentucky--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--was
there
a
victoria's
secret
in
this
town?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
tennessee?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you...
you...
go
ahead.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
owner
of
the
senior
mark
is
entitled
to
more
protection
than
that.
i...
i
just
want
to
make
clear,
you
do
not
contest
that
tarnishment
is
a...
a
basis
for
the
respondent
to
prevail
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
don't
know
why
you
need
sophisticated,
so-called
sophisticated
polls
to
determine
whether
there's
tarnishment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
focusing
on
the
present,
suppose
i'm
a
trial
judge,
and
this
case
comes
to
me
in
the
pretrial
conference
stage,
and
i
say,
you
know,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
this
second...
this
junior
user
is
going
to
tarnish
the
image
of...
of
the
senior
user.
is
that
all
i
need
to
say,
and
then
i...
what
do
i
put
down
when
i
write
an
opinion
so
that
the
circuit
court
can
review
my
thinking?
i
mean,
what...
what
do
i
put
down?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--all
i
need
to
know
is
the
number
of
catalogues,
how
well-known
the
mark
is,
and
that's
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
my
own
judgment
as
to
what
tarnishment
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
mr.
dellinger--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
proof,
then,
submission?
if
you've
got
a
very
famous,
distinctive
mark,
and
you've
got
a...
a
very
similar
use.
you
have
those
two
things,
and
then
you
get
a
few
colonels
to
say
yes,
when
they
think
of
the
junior
mark
they
think
of
the
senior,
is
that
enough
proof?
