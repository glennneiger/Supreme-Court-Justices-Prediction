which
wouldn't
include
tarnishment.
i
mean,
it
can
still
identify
budweiser
beer
very,
very
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what's
your
answer?
what's
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
do
you
want?
what
do
you
want
in
place
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
want
the
plaintiff
to
show?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know...
what
does
that
mean,
of
consumer
perceptions
that
causes
dilution?
objective
proof
that
a
particular
consumer,
when
he
saw
victoria's
little
secret...
or
victor's
little
secret...
had
in
mind,
gee,
you
know,
that's
like
victoria's
secret.
is
that
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
enough?
what
does
dilution
consist
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
started
off
saying
dilution,
you...
to
show
dilution,
you
had
to
show
economic
harm.
that
i
can
understand.
you
produce
evidence
that...
of
some
harm.
that
is
now
not
your
position.
i
don't
understand
what
your
position
is.
if
it
is
not
a
showing
of
economic
harm,
you
know,
the...
the
mark
is
worth
so
much
less
than
it
was,
what
precisely
do
you
want
to
show?
i
truly
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
fine,
what
else
do
you
demand?
what
is
it
that
you
do
demand.
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
what
it
is
that
you
do
demand.
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you...
you
would
get
that
answer
from
a
consumer
if
you
asked
them
about
the
word,
delta,
what
products
do
you
associate
with
the
word,
delta,
and
the
consumer
would
say,
airplanes,
or
air...
you
know,
air
travel
and
faucets,
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
dilution
there,
would
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
believe...
are
you
saying
that
the
delta
example
is
only
good
now,
and
that
when
the
person
who
made
delta
faucets
first
came
out
with
a
faucet
that
he
called
delta,
or
delta
airline...
i
don't
know
who
came
first...
the
chicken
or
the
egg,
the
airline
or
the
faucet.
whoever
had
the
name
first,
are
you
saying
that
when
somebody
used
the
name
delta
that
the
senior
user
of
delta
could
have
excluded
the
faucet-maker
from...
from
delta?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
can't
even
have
delta
peanuts?
once
delta
is
famous,
just
for
air
travel,
i
can't
use
delta
for
anything
else?
that
would
automatically
violate
the
federal
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
you
have
to
do
is
find
a
consumer
who
knows
of
delta
peanuts
and
says,
you
know,
what
do
you
associate
the
name
delta
with,
and
he
says,
airlines
and
peanuts?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
but
that's
confusion.
i
mean,
if...
if
there's
confusion,
you
don't
need
this
new
law.
i
thought
that
it
was
the
case
that
if
you
come
out
with
a
kodak
piano,
even
if
nobody
in
the
world
thinks
that
kodak,
the
photography
company
has
anything
to
do
with
kodak
piano,
the
mark
has
nonetheless
been
diminished.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
goes
to
the
very
point
you've
just
been
talking
about,
and
contradicts
what
you've
said.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
there's
any
confusion
or
not,
you
can't
use
kodak.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it...
i
mean,
that's
to
some
extent
a
play
on
words.
it
depends
on
what
you
mean,
has
actually
suffered
economic
injury.
what
your
opposing
counsel
says
now
is
that
all
he
means
by,
has
actually
suffered
economic
injury,
is,
has
suffered
dilution,
has
actually
suffered
dilution
of
the
mark,
which,
of
course,
entails
economic
injury.
if
the
mark
is
diluted,
the
mark
was
worth
a
lot,
and
it's
now
diluted,
there's
economic
injury.
now--
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
bad?
i
mean,
you
see,
i
am
so
far
behind
understanding
you
that
i
don't
know
whether
you
have
just
asserted
that
that's
obviously
bad.
i
think
you
have.
tiffany's
restaurant
is
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
will
it
all
end?
justice
antonin
scalia
chevrolet
doesn't
matter.
you
can
use
chevrolet,
because
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
or
edsel,
even
easier...
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
say
it
signifies
something
distinctive,
you
don't
mean
that
buick
signifies
cars,
you
don't
mean
that
tiffany's
signifies
jewelry,
you
don't
mean
that
rolls-royce
signifies
sedans,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
pepsodent
would
lose,
or,
you
know,
just
some...
some
product--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
just
a...
you
know,
it's
an
ordinary
product.
how
can
you
have
an
absolutely
wonderful
toothpaste?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can.
there's
no
tiffany
of
toothpastes,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we're
only
talking
about
tiffany's,
rolls-royce,
a
couple
of
other
really,
really
quality
names.
is
that
what
the
statute
was
directed
at?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
confusing
the
marks.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
you
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand...
you
can
say
it,
but
i
don't
understand
it.
i
can
still
identify
and
distinguish
victoria's
secret,
but
i
just
think
less
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
doesn't...
any...
it
isn't
any
less
identifiable.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
take
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
--nothing
could
be
clearer
than
that
congress
adopted
a
definition
of
what...
of
what
dilution
consists
of
and,
to
my
mind,
that
definition
does
not
at
all
cover
disparaging
the
other
product.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
house
committee
thought
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
congress
thought
was
the
definition
that
congress
adopted.
