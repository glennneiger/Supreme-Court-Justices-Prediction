could
the
library
in...
general
olson,
in
view
of
what
you
answered
earlier,
you
said
any
patron
could
say,
i
want
to
unblock
everything.
could
the
library
say,
well,
we
want
our
staff
to
have
access
to
everything?
therefore,
we
are
going
to
unblock
everything
for
the
computers
that
we
use
internally.
i
thought
the
answer
to
that
question
was
no,
but
it
seems
inconsistent
with
the
answer
that
you
gave.
a
patron
says,
i
want
to
see
everything.
fine.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
one
of
the
things
that
was
criticized
about
this
statute
was
that
every
terminal,
even
the
ones
in
the
librarian's
own
office,
closed
office,
has
to
have
this
filtering.
but
your
answer
is,
no,
they
don't.
you...
you
make
it
sound
like
it's
really
the
library's
option.
if
they
want
to
put
everything
on,
they
can.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
olson,
the
words
of
the
statute
itself,
though...
there
is
some
ambiguity.
it's...
with
regard
to
disabling
the
filter,
the
words
are
for
bona
fide
research
or
other
lawful
use.
and
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
your
prior
answer
meant
other
lawful
use
means
anything?
so,
in
effect,
for
an
adult
anything
but
obscenity
would
be
a
lawful
use.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
olson
said
no,
you
don't
have
to
explain.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
if
you
read
other
lawful
purpose
to
mean
everything
except
the
specific
categories,
child
pornography,
obscenity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
you
used...
you
said
perhaps
50
percent.
this...
and
general
olson
said
tens
of
thousands
of
pages,
but
consider
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
relation
to
the
internet.
in
this
record,
at
least
in
this
opinion,
this
was
the
finding
made
more
often
than
any
other
by
that
three-judge
court,
but
every
time
they
used
the
word
substantial...
and
they
don't
give
us
any
50
percent.
substantial
over-blocking
is
the
word
that's
come
up
over
and
over
again.
i
think
you
must
have
said
it
in
at
least
a
dozen
findings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
this...
this
law
covers
elementary
and
secondary
schools
as
well,
but
this
challenge
relates
only
to
libraries.
