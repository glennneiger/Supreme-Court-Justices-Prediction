mr.
olson,
you
have
a
number
of
important
legal
concepts
to
address.
i
have
three
factual
questions.
i've
been
through
the
extensive
opinion
of
the
district
court,
and...
and
they
may
be
important
for
me.
three
different
things.
when
the
library
patron
requests
that
the
filter
be
disabled,
does
he
have
to
explain
why
he
wants
it
disabled?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
next
question.
do
you
ask
site
by
site
or
can
i...
can
the
library
patron
say,
unblock
the
whole
thing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
and
third,
the
district
court
said
in
some
cases
it
takes
24
hours
to
a
week.
is
that
the
usual
thing
or
does...
in
many
cases
can
the
librarian
just
push
a
button?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
have
a
problem
with...
with
that.
it...
it
seems
to
me
a
large
part
of
your
argument
is
you
want
us
to
think
of
this
just
in
the
same
context
of
the
librarian
going
through
a
list
of
books
and
deciding
what
books
to
buy.
but
the
internet
isn't
like
that.
what
is
it?
there's
a...
1.5
million
new
entries
into
the
system
every
day?
this
is
a
whole
new
medium.
it's
not
like
a
library.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
general
olson,
if
i
understand
the
situation
correctly,
the
libraries
are
wasting
a
lot
of
money
litigating.
they
could
simply
hire
somebody
to
come
into
the
library
every
day
and
say,
please
unblock
everything,
and
then
they
could
do
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
couldn't
the...
why
couldn't
the
children
be
protected
by
having
two
screens?
one
screen
for
the
kids;
the
other
for
the
adults.
one
is
blocked;
the
other
isn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought...
you
said
there
are
two
reasons
why
you
should
prevail,
and
we're
still
on
the
first.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
you...
you
said
at
the...
at
the
outset
that
it
would
be...
as
i
understood
it,
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
you
to
do
this
on
your
own
initiative.
and
now
you're
saying
that
you
could?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
be...
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
suppose
this
is
a
general
public
library.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
it
voluntarily
do
exactly
what
the
statute
tells
it
it
must
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
how
would
the
strict
scrutiny
come
out?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that...
and
that
is...
and
that
is
because
legally
you
would
be
a
state
entity
denying
access
to
a
designated
forum
to
a...
a
listener
who
is
a
member
of
the
public.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
your--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
i
think
we're
still
pursuing
the
first--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--sooner
or
later,
i
want
you
to
get
to
the
second--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
a
federalism
concept
and
you...
and
you
would
cite
our
cases
like
printz
and
so
forth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
your
argument
would
be
the
same
if
the...
if
the
state
of
california
were
doing
it.
it's
not
just
the
federal
government.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--oh,
you
mean
the
government--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
would
also
be
a
violation
if
the
government
paid
for
100
percent
of
the
cost
of
the
computer,
both
the
hardware
and
the
monthly
billing
for
the
internet.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
distinguishes
an
adult
from
a
child.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
general
olson,
i
hate
to
use
part
of
your
rebuttal
time.
but
would
you
tell
me
whether
the
government
thinks
we
should
address
the
unconstitutional
conditions
issue
that's
discussed
at
length
in
the
footnote
if
we
agree
with
you
on
your
principal
submission?
