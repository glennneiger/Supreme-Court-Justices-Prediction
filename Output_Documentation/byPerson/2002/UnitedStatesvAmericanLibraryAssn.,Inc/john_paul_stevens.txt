john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
would
apply
if
they
had,
say,
ten
computers
and
nine
of
them
were
financed
by
the
federal
subsidy
and
one
of
them
was
independently
financed.
that
one
would
be
covered
by
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
rely
on
the...
on
the
spending
clause
to
justify
this
restriction,
how
do
you...
how
does
that
justification
apply
to
that
tenth
computer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you...
you
could
have
it
on
a
separate
phone
line,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statute
would
still
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
do
you
justify
that
under
the
spending
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
wouldn't
it
be
equally
unreasonable
if
we
said
it
applies
to
separate
facilities
too?
i
don't
know
why...
i
don't
understand
the
distinction
between
a
branch
library
that
has
one
computer
in
it
and
a
big
central
library
with
10
computers,
one
of
which
is
separately
financed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
general
olson,
justice
white
wrote
a
number
of
opinions
in
the
first
amendment
area
where
he
started
out
saying,
this
is
a
case
about
billboards,
or
this
is
a
case
about
something
else.
i
would
think
this
is
a
case
about
the
internet.
it's
not
a
case
about
books.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
start
on
your
second
point,
let
me
just
ask
you
to
comment
on
one
thing
because
i
want
to
be...
i
want
the
solicitor
general
also
to
comment
on
the
same
thing.
do
you
think,
given
the
state
of
the
record
now,
if
we
agreed
with
the
government's
submission
that
the
district
court's
rationale
was
wrong,
would
it
be
proper
for
us
to
decide
to
rule
on
the
second
theory?
