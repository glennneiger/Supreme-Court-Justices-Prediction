general
olson,
what
does
the
record
disclose
is
the
percentage
of
lawful
material
that
is
excluded
under
these
software
programs
as
opposed
to
material
that
is
unlawful
for
the
library
to--
justice

mr.
smith,
why
shouldn't
we
be
conscious
of
the
holding
of
this
court
in
denver
area
v.
the
fcc
where
the
court
concluded
it
might
be
premature
to
apply
forum
analysis
due
to
changes
taking
place
in
the
law,
the
technology,
and
the
industrial
structure
related
to
telecommunications?
i
mean,
this
too
seems
to
me
an
area
for
caution,
is
it
not,
in
importing
wholesale
public
forum
analysis
in
the
library?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
think
denver
area
would
have
some
bearing
on
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
a
library,
when
you're
looking
for
a
book,
it
might
not
be
there,
and
you
might
have
to
go
to
the
librarian
and
order
it
or
borrow
it
from
another
institution.
i
don't
think
that's
atypical
of
what
happens
in
research.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
this
context,
perhaps
we
should
not
import
public
forum
analysis.
it
creates
lots
of
problems--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
instance,
in
public
schools,
as
has
already
been
discussed.
so
it's...
and
there
is
no
case
from
this
court
saying
that
having
an
internet
in
a
library
creates
a
public
forum.
that's
what
we're
here
to
decide
i
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
say
that
the
world
we
look
at
is
the
people
using
these
programs
under
the
federal
law
requirements
in
libraries,
then
it
isn't
a
public
forum.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
in
areas
where
it's
already
against
the
law
to
have
materials
that
are
obscene
or
harmful
to
minors?
you
think
the
government
has
no
authority
to
prohibit
its
aid
to
be
used
for
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
now,
should
we
make
any
allowance
here?
is
there
any
leeway,
if
you
will,
simply
because
the
technology
is
not
yet
available
to
filter
perfectly
where
it's
evident
that
there
isn't
a
huge
percentage
amount
of
things
that
are
being
excluded,
but
the
software
isn't
perfect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
should...
should
our
doctrine
take
that
into
account,
do
you
suppose?
