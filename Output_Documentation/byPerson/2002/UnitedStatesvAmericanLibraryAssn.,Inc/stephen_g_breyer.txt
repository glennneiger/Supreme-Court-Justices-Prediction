justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
that
would
prohibit
a
library
from
doing
the
following?
any
adult
who
wants
to
watch
the
thing
without
the
screen,
come
up
and
ask,
do
you
want
to
do
it,
and
you...
we
can
tell
you,
don't
watch
these
obscene
child
pornography,
et
cetera.
then
we
disconnect
it.
does
the
statute
prohibit
the
library
from
doing
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
also
a
public
forum
if
it's
a
public
school
library?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
want
a
yes
or
no
answer.
on
your
theory
is
it
or
is
it
not
a
public
forum
if
it's
in
a
public
school
library?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
need
a
yes
or
no.
you
either
do
think
it
is
or
you
don't
think
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
exactly
everything
is
the
same.
i
just
want
to
know
on
your
theory
of
the
public
forum
doctrine
is
the
10th
grade
library
or
in
an
elementary
school
or
a
high
school...
they
have...
they
do
exactly
what
the
libraries
do
here.
is
it
a
public
forum?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
on
your
theory
of
the
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
if
it
is
a
public
forum,
the
elementary
school,
addison
hill
elementary
school,
has
to
let
the
worst
possible
pornography
go
over
the
computers
that
come
into
the
public
school
library.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
want
my
answer
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no.
we
make
all
those
same
arguments
that
you've
just
made
and
say,
look,
there
would
be
all
these
other
alternatives
and
all...
all
the...
i'm...
i'm
just...
i'm
not
putting
a...
i'm
putting
a
difficult...
what
to
me
is...
is
a
difficult
problem
with
your
doctrine.
and
i...
i
want
to
see
how
it
works
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
i...
i
need
to
know
fairly
specifically
because
i
don't
want
if
there...
if...
to
me
frankly
if...
if
your
theory
of
it
means
that
every
public
school
has
to
have
a
computer
attachment
which
bring
this
material
into
the
school,
i
suppose
a
lot
of
schools
wouldn't
have
computers
at
all
in
their
libraries.
and...
and
that
is
worrying
me.
so
i'd
appreciate--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
fairly
definite
answer
on
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
answer
is
that
in
your
opinion
now
you
think
it
probably
would
be
constitutional
as
applied
to
school
libraries
but
not
as
to
public
libraries?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the...
the
other
part...
assuming
it's
some
kind
of
stricter
than
just
reasonable,
however
that
is
brought
about,
the...
i'm
very
much
concerned
also
about
something
justice
kennedy
raised.
if
all
that
this
statute
means
is
that
a
person
who
wants
access
to
the
10,000
deep...
whatever
it's
called...
what's
the...
some
special
word.
it's...
it's
deeply
like
star
wars
almost.
it's
some
kind
of
like
an
extra
galaxy
that's
very
hard
to
get
to.
all
right.
these
10,000
pages
which
now
were
blocked...
what
he
has
to
do...
that
person...
is
he
goes
to
the
desk
and
says,
please
unblock
it.
i
want
to
use...
i
want
to
do
research
and
this
is
blocking
things
that
i
want.
i'm
not
going
to
look
at
material
that
is
absolutely
unlawful,
such
as
this
very
obscene
material,
child
pornography.
and
then
the
library
is
free...
will
say,
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
all
that's
necessary,
you
have
to
go
to
the
desk,
what
is
the
great
burden
on
speech?
after
all,
i
grew
up
in
a
world
where
they
used
to
keep
certain
materials
in
a
special
place
in
the
library
and
you
had
to
go
and
ask
for
them.
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
that
in
the
statute.
all
it
says
in
the
statute
is
that
the
administrator
may
disable
a
technology
protection
to
enable
access
for
a
lawful
purpose.
so
why
couldn't
you
just
sign
a
piece
of
paper
saying
i
do
not
want
to
use
this
for
an
unlawful
purpose?
period.
end
of
the
matter.
what
in
the
statute
prevents
the
library
from
accepting
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
other
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that's
pretty
far-reaching.
it's
very
interesting.
but
the...
the
question...
i'm...
i
don't
suppose
you
object
to
the
federal
government
saying,
even
if
it's
money
to
be
spent
on
books,
you
cannot
spend
this
money
for
material
that
it
is
unlawful
for
the
student
to
see,
such
as
child
pornography.
are
you
objecting
to
that?
suppose
the
federal
government
were
to
say,
no
child
pornography.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
certainly
not,
okay.
so
then
what
you're
objecting
to
is
we
let
them
cut
that
stuff
out,
but
you're
objecting
to
the
requirement
of
a
particular
technology
where
the
technology
may
exclude
some
other
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
your
objection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
can
have
it.
you
just
have
to
go
up
to
the
desk
and
ask
for
it.
