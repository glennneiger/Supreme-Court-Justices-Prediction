mr.
paul
m.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
children's
internet
protection
act
is
unconstitutional
for
two
separate
reasons.
first,
the
act
does
require
libraries
accepting
federal
funds
to
engage
in
conduct
that
is
itself
at
least
presumptively
unconstitutional.
strict
scrutiny
does
apply,
we
say,
because
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--this
court's
whole
series
of
cases
involving
the
public
forum
doctrine,
your
honor,
which
i
noticed
was...
was
not
really
mentioned
by
my
colleague,
mr.
olson.
the
internet,
when
it
comes
into
the
library,
is...
all
of
the
information
available
on
the
internet,
as
diverse
as
human
thought...
immediately
available
to
the
patron.
it
is
the
most
pure
form
of
public
forum
that
you
can
possibly
imagine.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
the
whole
question
about
whether
the
library
could
do
it
this
way
depends
on
how
you
view
the
public
forum
doctrine.
and
the...
what
the
court
has
said
again
and
again
is
in
deciding
whether
something
is
or
is
not
a
public
forum,
you
look
at
whether
the
access
is
selective
or
general.
that...
that's
what
the
terminology
was
in
the
court's
case--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
applying
the
court's
general
holdings
in...
in
a
whole
series
of
cases
to
try
to
decide
whether
this
is
a
public
forum,
a
designated
public
forum,
created--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
internet
terminals
in
the
library
are
a
designated
public
forum,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
certainly
not.
we
do
not
say
that
strict
scrutiny
applies
to
the
decisions
that
the
library
makes
about
which
book
to
buy
because
when
the
library
buys
books,
it
chooses
books
one
by
one.
it
engages
in
selective
access
as
opposed
to
general
access.
with
the
internet,
on
the
other
hand,
the
entire
world
of...
of
content
that
is
on
the
internet
is
there
available
to
the
patrons.
it
has
not
been
selected--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--by
the
library
in
any
way.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that...
that...
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
the
way
the
public
forum
doctrine
works
in
our
judgment...
and
we're
basing
this
as...
as
close
as
we
can
on
this
court's
cases...
is
that
the
one
thing
that
government
can't
do
is
allow
all
content
under
the
sun,
not
even
knowing
what
content
is
there,
and
then
exclude,
cull
out
one
area
of
disfavored
content.
if...
if
you
say
that
that
exclusion,
that...
that
pointing
at
that
one
particular
area
of
content
and
excluding
it,
is
the
same
as
not
making
it
a
public
forum,
then...
then
the
public
forum
doctrine
no
longer
has
any
meaning.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the...
the
case
of
a
public
school
library
is
a...
is
a
more
difficult
case.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
think,
your
honor,
i
can't
give
you
a
yes
or
no
answer.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
would
have
to
know
how
the
policies
are
of
the
school--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--then
i...
then
i
do
say
it's
a
public
forum,
your
honor.
if
they
allow
students--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
certainly
not,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
certainly
not.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
first
of
all,
all
that
holding
that
it's
a
public
forum
does
is...
is
give
you
the
level
of
scrutiny
that
applies
to
the
rule.
then
you
have
to
look
at
the
rule,
apply
the
usual
standards
of
narrow
tailoring,
less
restrictive
alternatives,
compelling
interests--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--but
i
think
the
constitution
analysis
may
well
come
out
differently
with
respect
to
young
children,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--your
honor,
i
think
that...
that,
first
of
all,
classrooms
are
different
from
libraries
even
in
the
school
context
because
a
school
classroom...
library...
a
computer
is
obviously
not
used
for
independent
research.
if
the...
in
the
library
situation
in
the
school,
you
would
have
different
age
groups.
you'd
have
different
considerations.
you'd
have
different
policies.
there's
a
lot
of
different
things
that
could
be
distinguished
from
this
case.
and
i
think
it...
it's
important--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--it...
it
may
well
be,
your
honor,
depending
on
the
age
group,
depending
on
the
circumstances,
depending
on
the
way
the...
the
library
is
used
by
the
students.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--denver
area
has
a
substantial
bearing
and
i
think
it's
one
of
the
strongest
cases
supporting
our
position.
it
is
true
that
the
court
did
not
go...
it...
the...
the
plurality
opinion
in...
in
the
case
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
we're
going
to
apply
a
public
forum
analysis
and
strict
scrutiny,
but...
but
justice
breyer's
opinion
went
much...
very
close
to
that
and
said
we're
going
to
apply
very
heightened
scrutiny.
we're
going
to
look
very
carefully
at
this.
and
this
was
a
law
that
is
in
many
ways
closely
analogous
to
what's
going
on
here.
it
was
a
law
that
said,
we
have
a
public
access
station.
anybody
from
the
outside
world
can
come
in
and
put
whatever
programming
they
want
on
that
station,
but
we're
going
to
exclude
indecency,
just
that
one
area
of
content,
because
we
don't
think
that
belongs
in
the
home.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
the...
the
way
the
disabling
provision
is
set
up,
first
of
all,
is
it's
designed
to
give
the
library
some
job
to
determine
whether
your
purpose
is
bona
fide
or
not.
it
says
bona
fide
research
or
other
lawful
purpose.
so
the
first
problem
is
you
go
to
the
librarian's
supervisor
who
has
the
authority
under
the
statute
to
turn
off
the
filter
and
you
have
to
explain
to
them
what
your
purpose
is
to
look
at
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
the...
the
statute
on
the
face
of
it
says
the
library
is
required
to
inquire
into
your
purpose
and
make
a
decision
about
whether
it
is
a
bona
fide
research
purpose
or
other
lawful
purpose
for
looking
at
the
material
which
has
been
filtered
out
by
the...
by
the
filter.
so
you
have
a
discretion
problem
of
severe
proportions,
i
submit.
plus,
you
have
a
stigma
problem,
very
much
like
the
one--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--they
will
presumably
have
to
have
some
information
about
what
sites
you're
interested
in
looking
at
in
order
to
determine
whether
that
would
be
lawful
or
not.
so
they
will
then
have
to
inquire
into,
well,
what's...
what
is
it
you
need
to
get
that's
being
blocked?
why
are
you
looking
at
it?
is
it
lawful?
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
clearly
the
library
is
responsible
for
determining
whether
or
not
you
fall
within
the
exception.
even
if...
even
if
they're
empowered
under
the
statute...
and
i
think
this
is
unclear...
just
to
accept
your
representation
without
any
further
explanation,
you
still
have
the
problem
that
you're
going
up
to
the...
to
the
librarian
and
saying
please
turn
off
the
smut
filter.
i
need
to
get
access
to
some
material.
so
that...
that
you're
being
required
to
do
that.
there's
a
stigma
problem
very
much
like--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--there's
a
third
problem,
which
is
you
have...
a
lot
of
times
this
will
only
come
up
in
the
middle
of
your
research
session.
you
won't
know
that
you're
going
to
be
blocked
getting
access
to
the
republican
national
committee
site
or
to
the
site
for
some
orphanage
that
is
trying
to
raise
money.
there's...
since
the...
many
of
the
blocks
are
so
irrational,
you
can't
anticipate
it.
so
you'll
have
to
stop
your
session
and
go
talk
to
a
librarian
about
getting
this
thing
turned
off
or
getting
this
site
unblocked.
somebody
will
then
have
to
look
at
the
site--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--but
certainly,
your
honor.
but...
but
our
submission
is
that
you
shouldn't
just
willy-nilly
compare
the
internet
in
the
public
library
to
books
and
how
they're
handled
by
libraries
because
the
internet
is
a
public
forum.
it
is
all
of
this
content
that
has
not
been
prescreened
or
preselected
by
the
government
which
they
are
making
available
to
you--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
perhaps--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--indeed,
your
honor.
and...
and
the
court
has
repeatedly
cautioned
that
when
you're
making
a
decision
about
whether
something
is
a
public
forum,
you
have
to
look
at
the
particular
medium
of
communication
that
is
at
issue,
not
the
broader
context.
so,
for
example,
when
the
court
in
cornelius
was
looking
at
the
combined
federal
campaign
and
trying
to
decide
whether
that
was
a
public
forum,
the
government
said,
well,
it's
the
federal
work
force.
the
federal
work
force
is
not
a
public
forum.
but
the
court
said,
no,
we
have
to
look
and
see
what
kinds
of
people
have
been
given
access
to
the
combined
federal
campaign
and
allowed
to
solicit
funding
from
the
federal...
the
federal
workers
and
has
it
been
done
on
a
selective
basis
or
a
general
basis.
because
it
was
selective,
the
court
ultimately
determined
that
it's
not
a
public
forum.
it
may
well
be
that--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
if
you
allow
the
government
to
define
its
forum
as
all
content
under
sun...
under
the
sun
ever
invented
by
mankind
except
the
piece
that
they
don't
like,
then
i
submit
that...
that
will
be
the
end
of
the
public
forum
doctrine
because
there
will
never
be
any
situation
in
which
the
government
will
be
constrained
in
any
way
to
censor
out
a
particular
piece
of
content
that
it...
from
the
public
forum.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
right,
but
i'm...
we're
here
in
the
context
of
designated
public
forums.
and
if
you
allow
content--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--if...
if
you
allow
the
content--
[laughter]
--to
be
defined
as
everything
but,
that's
okay.
then
there...
there
is
no
doctrine.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
and
it...
and
then
it
has
to
make
another
decision.
is
it
going
to
just
turn
the
internet
on
or
is
it
going
to
do
what
it
could
do,
which
is
to
say
we
are
going
to
treat
websites
like
we
treat
books.
we're
going
to
look
at
them
one
by
one
and
decide
whether
they
should
be
available,
whether
they
meet
our
collection
development
policies.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
no,
no.
it
would
be...
it
would
trigger
strict
scrutiny
for
a
library
to
do
exactly
what
the
statute
requires.
that's
our
submission,
which
is
to
say
if
they
allow
the
whole
internet
in
except
this
one
piece
of
content
under
the
public
forum
doctrine...
or
perhaps
the
court
wants
to
apply
the
kind
of
public
forum
doctrine
light
of
the
whole
question
of
whether--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
our
position
is
that
that
would
trigger
strict
scrutiny
that
they
would
then
have
to
satisfy
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--excuse
me?
well,
in...
in
most,
if
not
all,
cases
it
would
come
out
against
it.
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
clearly,
because
they're
blocking
a
vast
amount
of
speech
that
is
not
even
sexually
explicit.
and
so
we
have
a
narrow
tailoring
problem.
and
there
are
much
more...
much
more
effective,
less
restrictive
alternatives
which
we
had
all
this
evidence
at
trial
about.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes.
i'm
trying
to
make
sure
i
get
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
appreciate
it,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
paul
m.
smith
clearly
not,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
there's
no...
there's
no
argument
that
we...
we'd
make
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
they
would
then
be
letting
them
in
as
they
would
books,
using
their
collection
development
policies,
deciding
what's
valuable,
and
that
would
not
be
a
violation.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
absolutely
not.
if
they're
not
letting
everybody
in,
as...
as
general
access.
they're
exercising
selective
access.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it's
not
a
question
of
exclusion.
it's
a
question
of
affirmative
inclusion
through
selection--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no,
your
honor.
we
don't
acknowledge
that
excluding--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--excluding
an
area
of
content
can
take
it
out
of
the
forum
doctrine.
let
me
get
to
my
second
point,
though,
which...
which
is--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--oh,
clearly,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
there
are
any...
any
facts
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
court
that
haven't
been
brought
out
in
that...
that
trial
and
that
lengthy
opinion.
now,
our
position
with
respect
to
point
two
is--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--it
is
that
libraries--
[laughter]
--even...
even
if
the
internet
is
precisely
analogous
to
books
in
the
library
context,
that
something
about
the
library
context
lets
librarians
in
the
exercise
of
professional
judgment
that
they
ordinarily
exercise,
even
in
deciding
to
edit
the
internet,
that
the
federal
government
under
the
first
amendment
has
no
business
using
the
spending
power
to
try
to
distort
that
medium
and
push
librarians
away
from
their
professional
judgment
toward
the
most
restrictive
possible
policy
on
information
flow
into
the
library
setting.
in
other
words,
our
second
point
is
that
a
library
is
very
much
like
a
public
university
which
this
court
has
several
times
indicated
is
a...
is
a
special
sphere
set
off
for
the
governmental
promotion
of
private
and
free
expression,
that
in
that
kind
of
a
setting,
the
federal
government
should
not
use
the
spending
power
to
impose
a
one-size-fits-all
policy
about--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no,
your
honor.
i'm
citing
only
first
amendment
cases.
i
believe
it
is
a
first
amendment
concept
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
relationships
or
certain
kinds
of
institutions
in
which
the
amount
of
speech
that
is
being
allowed
is
decided
by
the
people
who
are
designated
as
professionals
to
run
that
institution.
for
example--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
if
it
was
done
by
statute.
but...
but,
for
example,
professors
should
set
the
curriculum
at
a
public
university.
i
don't
think
that
the
congress
can
say
to
the
universities
of
this
country,
we've
given
you
money,
you
therefore
have
to
cut
your
departments.
if
you...
if
you
take
the
money--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
it...
when
you
get
to
the
people
who
run
the...
run
the
university
as
their
job,
that's
fine,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
certainly
not,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--first
of
all,
let
me
address
the
book
question.
what
this
law
is
analogous
to
is,
as
applied
to
the
book
context,
a
law
where
the
government
says
we're
going
to
help
you
buy
books.
here's
10
percent
of
your
book
budget
a
year,
and
it
doesn't
just
say
you
can't
spend
our
money
on
books
of
a
particular
content.
it
says
you
can't
have
in
your
library
books
of
a
particular
content.
it
starts
to
try
to
invade
the
professional
judgments
of
librarians
about
what
books
would
need
to
be
to
their
patrons.
and
we
have
here
a
situation
where
93
percent
of
the
libraries
have
made
a
more
liberal,
more
open
policy
decision
than
the
one
that
the
congress
favors,
and
they're
now
using
the
spending
power
to
push
them
in--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
as
long
as
it
was
viewpoint
neutral,
your
honor,
and
otherwise
a
legitimate
line,
that
would
be
not
a
problem.
but...
but
here--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--to
the
extent
one
could
define
that
concept,
i
think
that
generally
the
government...
the
court
has
said
the
government
can
decide
what...
what
the
money
that
it
uses
to
subsidize
the...
the
local
government
with...
what
it
will
be
spent
on,
but
it
can't,
i
think,
then
expand
the
subsidy
into
attempting
to
regulate
things
like
the
other
book
decisions
that
the
library
might
make.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
of
course
not,
your
honor.
certainly
the
government
can
say
that
you
shouldn't
make
available
materials
to
people
that...
that...
for
whom
they
have
no
constitutional
right
to
see
them,
obscenity
for
adults--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--if...
if
i
might,
just
in
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor,
take
a
moment
to
describe
what...
what
it
really
is
that
the
record
shows
about
how
these
filters
operate
because
i...
i
think
that
that's
really
very
helpful.
what
these...
these
filters
are,
are
lists
of...
of
sites
that
are
banned
for
access
in
the...
in
the
setting
where
they're...
where
they're
in
effect,
and
the...
the
findings
are
that
there's
about
100,000
sexually
explicit
sites
on
the
internet
at
the
time
of
trial.
and
so
we
can
assume
that
some
high
percentage
of
that
100,000
are
on
the
list,
90,000
perhaps,
because
there
were
some
that
they
missed
constantly.
now,
in
addition,
the
court
found
that
the...
the
very
same
list
blocks
at
least
tens
of
thousands
of
additional
sites
that
are
not
sexually
explicit
at
all
or,
if
they
have
sexually
explicit
materials,
are
educational.
they...
they
teach
people
about
gay
sexuality
or
they
teach
them
about
safe
sex
techniques.
and
so
we
have...
on
these
lists
is
a
proportion,
a
huge
proportion,
perhaps
25,
perhaps
50
percent
of
the
sites
that
are
blocked
that
are
not
illegal
even
for
children.
now,
of
the
90,000
or
so
that
are
blocked
that
are
sexually
explicit,
there
isn't
a
shred
of
evidence
in
this
trial
record
that
the
government
attempted
to
put
in
about
whether
any
of
those
are
obscene.
there
was
no
showing
of
any
kind
that
the
filters
ever
actually
find
speech
that
is
illegal
for
adults.
and
there's
good
reason
to
think
that
there
isn't
a
lot
of
it
on
there
because
clearly
illegal
material
is
distributed
in
a
different
way
than
the...
than
the
way
that
would
allow
the
filtering--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--if
i
could...
if
i
could
address
that,
your
honor.
the...
the
court
did
say
at
least
tens
of
thousands
and
they
used
the
word
pages
at
that
point.
but
it's
quite
evident,
if
you
look
at
the
way
they
were
reasoning
from
the
evidence,
that
they
meant
sites.
and
the
evidence
is
that
there's
about
11
million
websites
on
the
internet,
in...
in
the
accessible
part
of
the
internet
and
that
100,000
of
those
are
the
sexually
explicit
ones
and
that
the...
there
are
at
least
tens
of
thousands
more
that
are
on
the
list.
so
it's...
the
government
also
says
in
their
brief
that
about
one
percent
of
the
internet
is
over-blocked,
which
would
be
about
100,000
sites.
so
it
is
a
substantial
percentage.
it
is
also
a
substantial
amount.
and
most
importantly,
it's
a
very
large
percentage
of
what
they're
blocking
is
not
what
they
intend
to
block.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
that
is
not
my
answer.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no.
our
answer
is--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
way
for
it
not
to
be
a
public
forum
is
for
them
to
decide
affirmatively
what
they
do
want
to
include,
not
simply
to
say
we'll
take
the...
the
content
of
400
million
people
contributing
to
the
internet,
but
we'll
carve
out
one
thing.
if
you
allow
that,
then
there
is
no
designated
public
forum
doctrine,
and
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
the
distinction
between
a
public
forum
and
not
is
whether
or
not
there's
been
selective
access,
which...
by
which
it
means
case
by
case--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--maybe
chat
rooms
are
okay
because
the
question
is
whether
that's
a
content-based
exclusion.
but
clearly,
here
you
have
a
content-based
exclusion.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
and
it--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
fact
that
they
may...
may
or
may
not
think
they
have
a
good
reason
for
doing
it
can't
factor
into
the
analysis,
your
honor.
the
way
the...
the
public
forum
doctrine
works
is
you
look
at
whether
or
not
they...
they
have
allowed
access
generally
or
not,
and
if
they
have
allowed
access
generally
and
then
they
say,
but
we
don't
want
this,
then
that's
a
violation
or
at
least
it
triggers
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
because
it
lets
in
everything
in
the
world.
every
commercial
site,
every
catalog,
everybody's
personal
website,
and
a
million
other
things
i
can't
even
conjure
up
are
all
being
allowed
in
and
provided
to
people
in
that
setting.
and
then
they're
saying,
except
you
can't
have
this.
now,
if
that's
permitted
under
the
forum
doctrine,
how
can
southeastern
promotions
be
right
where
they
said
you
can
have
any...
any
play
except
hair?
we
don't
like
hair.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
and
you
have
to
deal
with
exactly
the...
the
discretion
of...
of
the
librarian
and
about
whether
or
not
he
or
she
is
going
to
allow
you...
allow
it.
you
have
to
deal
with
the
stigma,
and
you
have
to
take
the
time
out
from
your
research
session
to
go
do
that
if
it
turns
out
in
the
middle
of
your
research
session
that...
that
some
site
that
you
need
to
go
to.
and
you
have
to
decide
to
do
it
not
seeing
the
site
because
you
can't
see
it
to
know
whether
it's
valuable
to
you.
so
when
you're
surfing
the
internet,
the
vastly
more
likely
outcome
will
be
that
anything
that's
blocked
people
will
just
bypass
and
go
on
to
something
else.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
it's
not
clear
that
the
librarian
would
say
yes.
the
librarian
certainly
doesn't
have
to
say
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it
seems
he's
on
a
horn...
the
horns
of
a
dilemma.
either
that
is
something
that
has
got
a
lot
of
stigma
to
it
that
very
few
people
are
going
to
do,
so
it
has
the...
the
effect
of
suppressing
speech,
or
everybody--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that
is
my
position.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
sure.
you've
got
to
go
up
and
say
please
turn
off
the
porn
filter,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
that's
what
it
is.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
if
it
turns
out
that
people
wouldn't
be
stigmatized
by
that...
and
i
think
the
court
below
was
correct
to
conclude
that
they
will
be...
then...
then
there's
the
second
problem,
which
is
what...
what
is
the
purpose
that
you've
accomplished
by
requiring
people
to
go
through
this
meaningless
exercise
other
than
to
deter
them.
that
is
apparently
then
the
only
purpose
of
it
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--you
can
do
that
in
many
different
ways,
your
honor,
that
don't
require
anybody
to
approach
anybody.
you
simply
have
a...
a
card
that
they
put
in
the
computer
that
shows
their
age,
and
then
it
gives
them
whatever
access
the
library
decides
is
appropriate
or
whatever
the
parents
may
have
decided
is
appropriate
for
the
children.
there
are
many
less
restrictive
alternatives
including
use
of
the
filtering
technology
as
an
option,
at
the
parents'
option
for
different
ages
that...
that
can
be
considered
and
which
were
explored
in
depth
by
the
district
court,
which
i
must
say
looked
at
this
issue
very
carefully,
was
very
sympathetic
to
the
problems
that
arise
with
the...
with
the
sexually
explicit
content.
it
said
the
one
thing
we
can't
do
is
have
one
across-the-board
answer
even
in
one
library,
especially
nationally,
to
have
congress
which
has
no
knowledge
at
all
about
what
conditions
may
prevail
in
any
given
library,
saying,
well,
we're
going
to
push
you,
through
the
budgetary
process,
toward
our
position
even
though
93
percent
of
the
librarians
have
found
a
much
more
suitable
set
of
solutions
in
less
restrictive,
somewhat
more
subtle,
more
mixed
policies
than
the
one
that
congress
decided
in
its
wisdom
it
should
try
to
force
on
the
library
community
using
the
spending
power.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
only
to
public
libraries,
your
honor.
