mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
libraries
block
internet
pornography
from
their
computer
terminals,
they
are
simply
declining
to
put
onto
their
computer
screens
the
same
content
they
have
traditionally
excluded
from
their
bookshelves.
by
offering
internet
access
without
pornography,
freedom
of
speech
is
expanded,
not
abridged.
under
the
children's
internet
protection
act,
or
cipa,
no
internet
speech
is
prohibited,
inhibited,
threatened,
or
chilled.
libraries
are
simply
exercising
their
discretion
as
to
the
content
that
their
libraries
will
contain,
the
historic
discretion
to
exercise
that...
that
authority,
and
to
how
their
library
resources
will
be
used.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
shall
i
wait
until
you've
asked--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
my
understanding
that
the...
the
library
patron
would
not
have
to
explain
any
reason
why
he
was
asking
a
site
to
be
unblocked
or
the
filtering
to
be
disabled.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
library
patron,
if
the
patron
is
an
adult,
can
ask
the...
the
entire
filtering
to
be
disabled,
and
the
library
may
disable...
i
mean,
eliminate
the
filtering
with
respect
to
specific
sites
either
on
their
own
or
at
the
request
of
a
patron.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that
it
is...
it
is...
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that,
and
i...
but
my...
my
experience
and
my
judgment
in
connection
with
our
preparation
is
that
it
need
not
be
a
very
difficult
thing.
it's
something
that
libraries
can
do
without
a
great
deal
of
difficulty.
but
to
the
extent
that
it
took
any
time
at
all,
it
would
be
the
same
as
asking
for
a
book
that
is
not
on
the
shelf
or
asking
for
an
inter-library
loan,
the
kind
of
customary
things
that
library
patrons
do
when
they
ask
for
a
book
or
a
resource
in
a
library.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
i...
i
know
of
nothing
in
the
statute
that
would
prohibit
the
library
from
doing
that,
provided
that
the...
the
person
asks
and
the
patron
asking
is
an
adult.
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
libraries
to
sponsor
the
viewing
of
pornography.
when
government
gives
financial
aid
to
speech
on
government
premises,
it
may
make
rational
choices
as
to
what
not
to
finance.
those...
that...
that
doctrine
is
consistent
with
this
court's
previous
decisions.
in
connection
with
this
particular
content,
congress
and
this
court
have
found
that
government
has...
the
government
has
a
compelling
interest
in
preventing
the
dissemination
of
obscenity,
child
pornography,
and
in
the
case
of
minors,
material
that
is
harmful
to
children.
such
material
has
been
traditionally
excluded
from
public
libraries,
and
government
has
a
basic,
fundamental
right
in
addition
not
to
associate
with
or
finance
pornography.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
justice
souter,
that
is...
that
is
true
that
any
system
is
going
to
involve
some
over-blocking
and
under-blocking
because
it's
impossible
to
know
what
is
going
to
be
coming
over
the
internet
or
impossible
to
make
systems
that
are
perfect.
but
that's
consistent
with
what...
the
historical
decisions
that
libraries
have
made.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's...
there's
several
answers
to
that
it
seems
to
me.
in
the
first
place,
libraries
have
known
that
they
have
not
stocked
pornography,
and
it's
not
because
of
space,
popularity,
or
expense.
they
have
chosen
traditionally
not
to
stock
that
type
of
material.
every
time
a
library
decides
not
to
subscribe
to
a
magazine,
it
is
over-blocking
in
a
sense.
a
magazine
may
have
three
pornographic
pictures
in
it
or
sexually
explicit
pictures
in--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
knows
what
the
magazine
has
been.
it
may
not
know
what
the
magazine
is
in
the
future.
furthermore,
librarians
don't
read
every
book.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
but
it
can...
it
can
test
this...
what
we're
saying
here
with
respect
to
that
is
over-blocking
or
under-blocking
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
library
function
of
making
appropriateness
judgments
with
respect
to
content
generally.
that's
the
type
of
distinction--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
and,
justice
kennedy,
it
seems
to...
it
seems
to
the
government
and
it
seemed...
it
seemed
to
congress
that
gross
judgments
are
going
to
have
to
be
made.
these
libraries,
as
the
record
reflects
and
the
findings
of
the
district
court
reveal,
traditionally
or...
or
customarily
block
e-mail,
chat,
gambling,
gaming,
dating
services,
and
some
of
them,
as
reflected...
i
think
it's
on
page
37,
38
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement...
make...
make
judgments
with
respect
to
what's
appropriate,
what's
offensive.
those
types
of
judgments
are
being
made.
yes,
this
is
a
new
medium
and
it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
that...
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
our
point.
this
is
a
difference
in
quantity,
but
it
is
not
a
difference
generically
from
what
libraries
traditionally
have
done.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
in
a
specific
situation,
a
library
might
know
that.
a
library
might
decide
that
it
would
just
stock
history
books
or
just
stock...
stock
novels
of
a
particular
period.
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
libraries
don't
have
the
right
to
make
those
decisions
and
customarily
make
those
decisions.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
that's
right,
but
the
traditional
decisions
that
libraries
have
made...
and
the
appellees
do
not
dispute
this...
is
that
libraries
have
not
chosen
to
stock
the
types
of
material
on
their
shelves
that
they're
now
being
asked
to
keep
out
with
respect
to
the
internet.
this
is
a
similar
decision
with
a
different
medium.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but,
justice
souter,
they...
they
may
on
their
own...
there's
a...
there's...
one
of
the
materials
that's
in
the
record
is
someone
that
made
a
study
of
several
hundred
thousand
sites
and
decided
which
ones
were
properly
blocked
or
improperly
blocked.
those
types
of
studies
may
be
used
to
unblock
sites,
to
modify
the
filtering
system.
libraries
could
get
together
and
create
their
own
filtering
system
rather
than
the
ones
that
are--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i...
i
believe
that
the
answer
is
that,
a,
the
librarian
can,
in
response
to
a
request
from
a
patron,
unblock
the
filtering
mechanism
altogether.
and
secondly,
i
think
it's
not
entirely...
it's
not...
the
statute
doesn't
get
into
it,
but
it...
but
it
seems
entirely
consistent
with
what
i've
just
said,
and
i
think
consistent
with
the
import
of
your
question
is
that
the
library
staff
can
disable
the
filter
in
order
to
make
judgments
about
whether
something
has
been,
quote,
properly
or
improperly
blocked.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i...
i
was
answering
your
question
with
respect
to
what
the
staff
may
review
in
making
the
administrative
decisions
with
respect
to
unblocking
or
other
decisions
with
respect
to
the
implementation
of
the
statute.
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
having
in
place
this
technological
mechanism
by
which
this
material
can
be
filtered
out
or
is
designed
and
calculated
to
do
that.
it
doesn't...
the
statute
does
not
require
perfection.
it
doesn't
require
librarians
to
act
in--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--with
respect
to
that
patron.
i
mean,
the...
the...
if
my
answer
suggested
that
the
library
could
just
switch
off
the
filter
on
a
daily
basis,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
anything
remotely
like
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it...
this...
particular
patrons
may
say,
i'm
investigating
breast
cancer.
this...
the
sites...
some
of
the
sites
that
i'm
looking
for
i
can't
find,
and
they
appear
to
be
on
block.
can
those
sites...
or
i've
heard
about
these
sites...
be
unblocked?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's...
that's
correct.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that...
that
may
happen,
justice
scalia.
the
system
is
not
perfect.
it
is
not
going
to
be
perfect.
but
what
it
does,
it's
a
reasonable,
rational
articulation
by
congress
of
an
attempt
to
decide--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
think
that
is...
again,
is
a
practical
judgment
that
may
work
in
some
libraries.
it
might
require
a
great
deal
more
resources
from
librarians.
it
might
require
establishing
different
screens
and
mechanisms.
yes,
there
are
ways
in
which
congress
could
have
done
this
differently,
but
this
is
a
rational
judgment,
consistent
with--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
that
the...
my
answer
to
your
question,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
is
that
the
computers
in
the
library,
if
the
library
uses
the...
the
federal
funds
with
either
respect
to
the
discounts
or
the
subsidies,
direct
subsidies,
all
the
computers
in
that
library
must
be
equipped
with
the
technology
protection
measure
with
respect
to
each
of
those
computers.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
but
that
does
not
preclude
the
staff
from
determining,
in
connection
with
specific
requests--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
one
could...
you're
in
an
area,
it
seems
to
me,
that...
where
there
might
be
an
as-applied
challenge.
we're
talking
about
a
facial
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i...
i
understand
that.
i...
and
the...
your...
the
import
of
your
question
suggests
that
in
this
situation
a
librarian
might
exercise
this
discretion
with
respect
to
a
filter.
i
don't
think
in
the
first
place--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--my
answer
to
your
question
is
that
to
the
extent
that
librarians
are
disabling
the
filter
for
the
performance
of
their
administrative
function--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
right.
but
remember,
this
is
in
the
context
of...
of
material
that's
been
traditionally
excluded
by
libraries,
that
libraries
are
free
to
put
on
their
shelves
in
the
form
of
books
anytime
they
want.
it...
the...
the
position
of
the
district
court
and
the
position
of
the
appellees
is
that
the
libraries,
by
doing
this,
violate
the
first
amendment
right
of
their
patrons.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
an
issue
in
that
context,
and
we're
suggesting
that
the
patrons
have
a
right
to
internet
access
anywhere
they
want
outside
the
federally
subsidized
library.
and
the
library
has
several
choices
it
may
make
here.
the
library
might
not
have
internet.
maybe
it's
not
appropriate
for
that
particular
library.
the
library
may
have
internet
with
the
filtering
and
accept
federal
money
with
respect
to
putting
in
the
computers.
or
the
library--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i...
i
think
they
could.
they
could
either
have
a
separate
branch
where
separate
federal
funds
are
not
being
obtained,
or
you're
talking
about
a
separate
administrative
ability--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--facility.
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
that
the
statute
would
prohibit
that
set
of
operations.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
it
would,
justice
stevens,
although--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--because
it's
a
reasonable
condition
to
the
operation
of
the
funds.
in
the
first
place,
justice
stevens,
in...
the
internet
is
going
to
come
through
one
opening,
and
the...
the
various
different
computers
will
be
plugged
up
to
that
one
opening
so
that
the...
the
technological
answer
in
part
to
your
question
is
it's...
the...
the
library
would
have
to
decide--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
the
library
could
do
that
sort
of
thing,
but
it
would--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
it
would.
yes,
it
would.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
believe
that
it's
a
reasonable
condition
that
congress
reasonably...
the
patrons
may
not
be
able
to
distinguish
where
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
again,
as
we
said
in
our
briefs,
that
to
the
extent
that
that
is
an
issue,
it
should
be
made...
that
point
should
be
made
in
a...
in
an
as-applied
challenge
to
the
statute,
as
opposed
to
a
challenge
on
the
face.
we
don't
think
it's
technologically
going
to
be
a
problem
and
we
do
think
that
congress
can
reasonably
have
assumed
we're
using
federal
money
to
finance
internet
in
this
library.
patrons
are
going
to
be
exposed.
if
you're
going
to
take
the
money,
we
would
like
patrons
not
to
be
exposed
in
this
manner
to
that
material,
and
the
congress
could
well
have
decided
that
it...
the
taxpayers
don't
want
to
be
associated
with
a
subsidy
of
that
types
of
material...
that
type
of
material
which
has
traditionally
been
excluded
from
the
libraries
in
any
event.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i...
well,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
reasonable
choice
for
congress
to
make.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
with
respect
to
all
of
the
computers
in
the
library
in...
in
that
narrow
context,
yes,
but
i
do
think
that
that's
the...
we're
getting
down
to
the
refinements
of
particular
applications
and
those
types
of
challenges
have
not
yet
been
made.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
believe
that
that's...
that's...
well,
child
pornography
would
also
be
excluded.
both
obscenity
and
child
pornography--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
are
federal
criminal
statutes
with
respect
to
both
of
those.
and...
and
again,
this
is
a
reasonable
effort
by
the
library...
by
the
congress
to
make
rational
decisions
with
respect
to
allowing
for
some
escape
for
people
who
are
doing
research
or
for
other
appropriate
purposes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i...
i
agree
with
that,
but--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if...
if...
excuse
me,
justice
scalia.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the...
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
statute
put
it
in
terms
of
bona
fide
research
or
other
lawful
purposes.
that...
there's
bound
to
be
some
interpretive...
given
the
joints
there.
and
again,
to
the
extent
that
that
would
trigger
a
funding
decision
with
respect
to
the
enforcement
authority
or
something,
that's
appropriately
raised
in
an
as-applied
challenge.
i
think
it's
important
to
stress
the
converse
of
what
the
appellees
are
asking
for
here.
they're
asking
this
court
to
make
a
judgment
that
the
first
amendment
prohibits
them
from
exercising
the
discretion
to
make
that
kind
of
choice
with
respect
to
the
internet
that
they've
always
made
or
traditionally
made
with
respect
to
the
books
on
their
shelf.
the
consequence
of
that,
it
seems
to
me,
would
be
strict
scrutiny
applicable
to
librarians'
judgments
with
respect
to
not
just
the
internet,
but
microfilm,
television,
other
medium
that
might...
other
media
that
might
come
into
the
library,
and
that
librarians,
instead
of
spending
money
on
books,
are
going
to
be
spending
money
on
lawyers
defending
cases
brought
by
authors
saying,
you...
you
violated
my
first
amendment
right
not
to
have
strict
scrutiny,
and
that
instead
of
librarians
making
these--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
might
be
if
the
decision
was
written
that
way,
justice
stevens,
but
if...
if
the
appellees
are
right,
the
types
of
decisions
that
librarians
have
been
making,
appropriateness
is...
is
the
word,
quality,
appropriateness,
and
appropriate
decisions...
it's...
it's
in
the
record.
those
types
of
decisions
the
librarians
are
saying...
asking
this
court
to
say
are
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
and
violate
the
constitution.
this
court
would
have
to
make
a
first
amendment
distinction
between
the
selection
of
a
book
and
the
selection
of
another
source
of

mr.
theodore
b.
olson
justice
scalia...
i
mean,
justice
souter--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
i
was
expecting
the
next
question.
[laughter]
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
nothing
is
being--
[laughter]
nothing
is
being
required
of
the
library.
the
library,
if
it
chooses--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
it
wants
to.
but
the
case
comes
to
this
court
in
the
posture
that
the
district
court
has
held
and
the
appellees
are
arguing
that
for
the
library
voluntarily
to
make
that
choice
on
their
own,
irrespective
of
any
federal
government
subsidy
or
anything,
would
violate
the
first
amendment
rights
of
their
patrons.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the...
the
testimony
was
varied,
justice
o'connor.
one
of
the...
one
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court
was
that
tens
of
thousands
of
pages
of
material
may
be
erroneously
blocked.
now,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
different
filters
might
block
different
things.
sites
may
be
unblocked.
the
filter
may
be
set
aside.
but
even
if
it's
tens
of
thousands
of
the...
of
the
2
billion
pages
of
material
that
is
on
the
internet,
we're
talking
about
one
two-hundredths
of
1
percent,
even
if
it's
100,000,
of
materials
would
be
blocked.
if
it...
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
page
37a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
which
is
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
in
the
first
full
paragraph,
the
court
found
approximately
95
percent
of
libraries
with
public
internet
access
have
some
form
of
acceptable
use
policy
or
internet
use
policy
governing
patrons'
use
of
the
internet.
now,
what
the
libraries
are
saying
here
is
the
exercise
of
certain
discretion
violates
the
first
amendment
rights
of
their
patrons,
and
therefore
every
time
they
exercise
that
type
of
discretion
in
this
context,
they're
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
what
this
statute
does
is
gives
the
libraries
the
right,
if
they
choose
to
accept
federal
funds,
to
make
what
kind
of
decisions,
to
exclude
pornography
which
there's
no
dispute
in
the
record
libraries
have,
from
time
immemorial,
chosen
not
to
put
in
their
libraries.
so
the
decision
that
they're
making
is
the
same
one
they
have
already
voluntarily
made
over
the
years.
it
would
inhibit
their
decisions
to
exclude
e-mail,
chat,
gambling,
dating
services,
and
the
other
things
that
this
part
of
the
court
below's
decision
held
that
they
are
doing
already.
it's
the
traditional
type
of
discretion
that
libraries
have
exercised
with
respect
to
whether
they
be...
want
to
be
a
fiction
library
or
a
library
that's
specializing
in
this
or
that
or
technology
or
anything
along
those
lines.
so
the
type
of
discretion
that
the
librarians
are
saying
violate
their
first
amendment
rights
are
the
types
of
discretion
precisely
that
they've
been
exercising
for
years.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i...
we
have
no
problem
if
the
court
decides
it,
although
it
wasn't
briefed
and
it
wasn't
the
decision
below,
but
we
don't
think
it's
remotely
possible
for
this
court
to
decide
that
question
in
this
context
against
the
government.
if...
if
the
libraries
are
right,
they're
saying
they
don't
have
a
first...
they
can't
have
it
both
ways.
they
don't
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
make
this
discretion...
discretionary
decision
with
respect
to
their...
the...
the
materials
in
their
library,
and
then
they
turn
around
and
say,
allowing
us
to
make
that
is
an
unconstitutional...
or
giving
us
an
incentive
to
make
that
very
decision
is
an
unconstitutional
condition.
this
is
a
condition
that's
connected
with
libraries'
traditional
decisions.
it's
in
an
area
where
the
government...
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
this
court
has
said
the
government
has
a
compelling
governmental
interest
already.
it's
a
condition
to
the
use
of
the
funds.
this
is
not
extracting
from
libraries
some
separate,
unconnected
decision.
it's
connected
with
the
actual
use
of
the
funds.
and
it
does
not
say
that
libraries
may
not
stock
pornography.
if
they
want
to
abandon
the
years
of
tradition
of
not
stocking
pornography
on
their
bookshelves
or
in
some
other
form,
movies,
whatever
it
might
be,
they
can
still
do
that
without
violating
this
condition.
so
the
libraries
have
plenty
of
choices.
they
can
not
accept
the
public
money.
they
can
accept
the
public
money
and
use
it
in...
in
the
way
that
congress
decided,
which
is
consistent
with
their
traditional
exercise
of
discretion.
there's
many
distinguishing
factors
between
this
case
and
the
cases
in...
in
which
the
court
has
exercised...
expressed
some
concern
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment
issues
here.
it
is
not...
this
case
is
not
a
regulation
of
speech,
but
the
actions
of
a
government
acting
in
a
proprietary
capacity...
a
library
to
make
its
own
decisions,
deciding
what
to
subsidize,
what
speech
to
have
in
that
library,
what
speech
not
to
have
in
that
library.
the
government
is
merely...
is
making
a
content
decision,
not
a
viewpoint
decision.
there's
no
contention
that
there's
a
viewpoint
decision.
the
type
of
decision
that
they
say
is
being
forced
upon
them,
which
is
actually
voluntary,
is
the
same
type
of
decision
that
libraries...
librarians
customarily
make.
the
federal
statute
and
the
library
policy
that
they're
complaining
about
expands
information,
it
doesn't
contract
information.
and
this
court
said
in
the
arkansas
educational
television
case,
a
jurisprudence
that
would
result
in
the
constriction
of
speech,
rather
than
the
expansion
of
speech,
would
be
a
repression
of
first
amendment
rights.
if
congress
can't
put
this
condition--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--thank
you.
