justice
antonin
scalia
or...
or
he
can
say,
according
to
you,
what
do
you
care
what
i'm
investigating?
i
just
want
the
site
unblocked.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wonder
how...
how
effective
that...
that
system
is
in...
in
achieving
some
of
the
goals
of
the
statute
which...
which
is
not
just
that...
that
some
people
using
the...
the
net
happen
to
stumble
across
pornographic
stuff
but
also,
passing
by,
see
it,
and...
and
including
children.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
saying
not
only
that
they...
that
they
don't
want
to
be
associated
with
the
subsidizing
of
it,
but
they...
you're
saying
they
don't
want
to
subsidize
an
operation
which
includes
some
nonsubsidized
material
of
this
sort.
don't
you
have
to
say
that
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
say
they've
made
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but...
but
how
would
that
authorize
the
unblocking
entirely
which
would
let
in
not
just
the
material
that's
useful
for
research,
but
also
obscenity,
also
child
pornography?
how
is
that
allowing
a...
a
lawful
use?
that's
allowing
an
unlawful
use,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you
agree
with
it,
it
means
that...
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no.
i
think
if
you
agree
with
it,
it...
it
means
that
you
can't
unblock
a
whole
channel.
you
can
say,
i'll
let
you
have
this
material,
but
i
can't
unblock
this
channel.
justice
antonin
scalia
god
knows
what
else
there
is
out
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wasn't
even
leaning
forward.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it
begs
the
question.
the...
the
point
is
that
the
government
is
saying,
if
you
want
to
get
our
money,
you
don't
let
it
all
come
in.
so
it
is
not...
it
is
not
a
public
forum
once...
once
the...
once
the
blocking
is
applied.
justice
antonin
scalia
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
necessarily.
i
mean,
a
library
says...
and
some
have...
some
did
this
before...
before
the
federal
statute
was
in
effect.
a
library
says,
there's
this
whole
wide
world
of
the
internet
out
there,
but
we
don't
want
all
of
it.
some
of
it
is
garbage,
and
therefore
we're
going
to
block
the
obscenity.
we're
going
to
block
the
child
pornography,
and
we're
going
to
block
the...
the
pornography
that's
harmful
to
children.
now,
once
they've
made
that
decision,
hey,
presto,
it
is
not
a
public
forum
anymore.
justice
antonin
scalia
designated
public
forum
doctrine.
justice
antonin
scalia
traditional
public
forums
will
always
be
public
forums.
justice
antonin
scalia
i've
always
had
trouble
with
that
doctrine
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
how
did...
i
mean,
it's
fine
to
say
it's
no
violation
of
the
constitution.
but
you're
also
saying
yet
it
remains
a
designated
public
forum.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it...
you
agree
it
would
not
be
a
designated
public
forum.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
don't...
don't
many
libraries
already
exclude,
for
example,
chat
rooms?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
i
mean,
but...
but
my
understanding
was
that
some
libraries
that...
that
have
access
to
the
web
do
not
allow
access
to
chat
rooms.
they
don't
think
that
that's
a
proper
library...
library
function
or
whatever.
at
least
as
to
those
libraries,
i
assume
you
would
acknowledge
that
there's
no
designated
public
forum.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
you
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
i
ask
you
a
question
about...
about
the
public
forum
doctrine?
as
i
understood
your
earlier
answer,
the
internet
is
not
a
public
forum
if
a
library
does
not
take
all
of
it
and
chooses
to
exclude
chat
boxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
that
isn't
your
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
remains
a
designated
public
forum
even
if
you
don't
take
all
of
it,
you
say.
chat
rooms.
we
don't
want
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
selective
access?
i...
we
don't
want
chat
rooms.
and
it's
not
a
total
free-for-all,
anybody
wants
to
come
in
and
talk.
no,
we
don't
want
chat
rooms.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
content-based.
no.
okay.
it's
not
a
content-based--
justice
antonin
scalia
--now,
so
if
they
say
no
chat
rooms,
it
doesn't
become
a
designated
public
forum.
why
does
it
remain
a
designated
public
forum
if
what
they
say
is,
in
addition
to
chat
rooms,
we
don't
want
that
portion
of
the
internet
that
runs
a
risk
of
bringing
into
our
computers
obscenity,
child
pornography,
material
harmful
to
children?
we
don't...
i
don't
really
know
what
it
is
but
it's
not
worth
it
to
us.
so
we
don't
want
chat
rooms
and
we
don't
want
this...
you
say
it's
over-inclusive.
it's
not
over-inclusive.
it's
whatever
it
takes
to
keep
out
of
what
we're
bringing
into
our
library
those
harmful
materials.
now,
why
does
that
mean
i've
created
a
public
forum?
