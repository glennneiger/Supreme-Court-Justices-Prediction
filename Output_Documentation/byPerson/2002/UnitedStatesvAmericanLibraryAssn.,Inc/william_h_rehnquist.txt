we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.

the

v.
the
american
library
association.
general
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
general
olson,
there
are
supposed
to
be
90,000
books
a
year
published
in
the
united
states.
do
you
think
librarians
know
the
contents
or
even
know
of
the
existence
of
all
of
those
90,000
books?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
general
olson.
mr.
smith,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
cases
are
you
relying
on
to
say
that
the
libraries
would
be
required
to
engage
in...
in
conduct
that
is
presumptively
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
relying,
at
any
rate,
on
cases
dealing
with
libraries
as
such.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
relying
on
a
more
general--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
conclude
that...
you
conclude
that
a
library
is
a
designated
public
forum.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
the
whole
library?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so...
so
a...
a
library
that
chooses
not
to
get
the
internet
at
all
is
not
a
public
forum.
it's
only
when
it
gets
internet
terminals
that
it
becomes
a
public
forum?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
point
two?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about...
can
the
board
of
regents
set
the
curriculum?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if...
what
if
the
federal
government
said,
we're
going
to
give
you
10
percent
of
your
annual
appropriation
and
you
can't
use
that
money
to
acquire
a
particular
class
of
books?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
you...
you
can't
use
it
to
acquire
soft
pornography.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
general
olson,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
one
is
02-361,
united
states
versus
american
library
association.
in
this
case
i
have
an
opinion
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
to
announce.
congress
provides
public
libraries
with
two
forms
of
federal
assistance
to
help
them
provide
internet
access.
upon
discovering
that
library
patrons
including
minors
regularly
search
the
internet
for
pornography,
congress
enacted
the
children's
internet
protection
act
or
cipa
which
forbids
public
libraries
from
receiving
federal
assistance
for
internet
access
unless
they
install
software
to
block
obscene
or
pornographic
images
and
to
prevent
minors
from
having
access
to
harmful
material.
they
appellees
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
cipa's
filtering
provisions
in
district
court.
the
district
court
held
with
congress
at
exceeded
its
authority
under
the
spending
clause
because
any
public
library
that
complied
with
cipa
would
necessarily
violate
the
first
amendment
that
the
filtering
software
is
content-based
restriction
on
access
to
a
public
forum
and
that
cipa's
filtering
provisions
do
not
survive
strict
scrutiny.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse.
because
public
libraries
use
of
filtering
software
does
not
violate
their
patron's
first
amendment
right,
cipa
does
not
induce
libraries
to
violate
the
constitution,
and
it
is
a
valid
exercise
of
congress'
spending
power.
to
facilitate
learning
and
cultural
enrichment,
public
libraries
must
have
broad
discretion
to
decide
what
material
to
provide,
heightened
judicial
scrutiny
as
incompatible
with
such
broad
discretion.
thus,
public
forum
principles
do
not
apply
here.
cipa
does
not
impose
an
unconstitutional
condition
on
libraries
that
receive
federal
assistance
by
requiring
them
as
a
condition
of
that
receipt
to
surrender
their
first
amendment
right
to
provide
access
to
constitutionally
protected
speech.
when
the
government
appropriates
public
funds
to
establish
a
program,
it
is
entitled
to
broadly
define
that
program's
limit.
the
government
here
is
not
denying
a
benefit
to
anyone
but
is
simply
insisting
that
public
funds
be
spent
for
the
purpose
for
which
they
are
authorized.
as
the
use
of
filtering
software
helps
to
carry
out
these
programs,
it
is
a
permissible
condition.
cipa's
filtering
conditions
do
not
distort
the
usual
functioning
of
public
libraries.
public
libraries
have
no
rule
that
puts
them
against
the
government
and
there
is
no
assumption
that
they
must
be
free
of
any
condition
that
their
benefactors
might
attach
to
the
use
of
donated
funds.
i
have
written
a
plurality
opinion
in
which
justice
o'connor,
justice
scalia,
and
justice
thomas
have
joined;
justice
kennedy
and
justice
breyer
each
have
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
souter
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
joined.
