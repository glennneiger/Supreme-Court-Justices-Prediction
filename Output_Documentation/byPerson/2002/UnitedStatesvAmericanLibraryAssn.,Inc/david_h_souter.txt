justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
part
of
the
problem
that
a
lot
more
is
being
excluded?
i
mean,
as
i
understand
it,
the
statute
requires
that
a...
a
filter
of
some
sort
be
used.
filters
are
not
sold...
the
blocking
devices
are
not
sold
or
prepared
apparently
in
terms
of
the
concepts
that
the
statute
uses.
the
companies
that
do
prepare
them
will
not
even
disclose
what
in
fact
they
are
blocking
so
that
it
seems
that
an
inevitable
price
of
this
is
blocking
more
than...
than
the
statute
requires,
and
that's
even
without
getting
into
the
question
of
blocking
material
for
adults
as...
as
opposed...
that...
that
might
be
unsuitable
for
children,
but
certainly
aren't
for
adults.
how
do
you...
how
do
you
get
over
the
problem
of
the...
sort
of
the...
the
imprecision,
the
crudity,
the
overkill
of
the
blocking
devices?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
one
thing
that
is
clearly
inconsistent
i
think,
and
that
is
when
the
libraries
make...
historically
have
made
these
decisions,
they've
known
what
they
weren't
buying
or
weren't
stocking
on
their
shelves,
and
here
they
don't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
they...
the
blocking
makers
regard
that
as
proprietary
information.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it...
but
it
does
know
what
the
magazine
is,
and
here
it
does
not
know
what
the
website
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it...
you
know,
it
knows
it's
playboy
or
whatever
the
magazine
is,
and
here
it
doesn't
know
what
the
website
is
that's
being
excluded.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
when
the
library
makes
a
book
decision,
doesn't
it
make
a
decision
that
says,
we
will
not
put
god's
little
acre
on
our
shelves?
it's
a
yes
or
no
decision
with
respect
to
the
book.
it's
quite
true
there
are
lots
of
books
out
there
that
the
library
not...
may
not
know
about,
but
when
it
makes
a
decision
not
to
put
it
on
the
shelf,
it
knows
what
it's
deciding
not
to
do,
and
here
it
doesn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
somebody
along
the
line
knows
what
they've
decided
to
buy
within
the
category
and
what
they
haven't
decided
to
buy.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's...
that's
true.
but
i
think
the
thing
that...
one
of
the
things
that's
troubling
us
is
they're...
they're...
they
are...
they
are
forced,
by
virtue
of
that
decision,
not
to
stock
a
lot
of
other
material,
and
they
don't
even
know
what
it
is
and
there's
no
way
for
them
to
find
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
with
respect
to
the
library
staff
on
the
unblocking?
i...
i
think
her
original
question
was,
could
the
library
say,
we
want
our
staff
to
have
free
access
on
the
computers
that
they
use,
not
that
we
want
them
to
be
able
to
look
behind
the
block
to
see
what's
being
kept
out.
we
just
want
them
to
have
a
free
computer.
is...
is
that
a
violation
of
the
statute?
i
had
thought
it
was--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
that
would
include
the
staff
computers.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that's
not
the
question.
the
question
is
can
the
library
say,
this
is
ridiculous
blocking
this
stuff
for
our
staff.
we're
not
going
to
block
them.
the
staff
computers
are
either
going
to
have
no
blocks
or
every
morning
we
will
press
the
button
that
unblocks
the
staff
computers.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would
violate
the
statute,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
we
want
to
know
the
extent
of
the
statutory
prohibition.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
i
want
to
know
is
whether
they
can
do
it
without
violating
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
my
question.
the
library
simply
says,
we
want
our
staff
to
have
free
computers.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would
violate
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
the
library
do
this?
could
the
library
say,
okay,
we're...
we're
certainly
going
to
comply
with
the
statute
for
the
library,
but
we
are
going
to...
we
are
going
to
establish...
or
the
city
says,
we
will
establish
a
separate
office?
it's
called
the...
the
computer
viewing
office.
it
has
a
separate
budget
from
the
library.
it's
in
a
separate
building.
it
has
a
separate
staff.
administratively
it's
different.
and
with
respect
to
the
computers
in...
in
that
establishment,
we're
not
going
to
ask
for
any
federal
subsidies
and
the
computers
are
going
to
be
wide
open.
any
reason
they
couldn't
do
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
there
a
practical
distinction
that's
got
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
your
argument?
and
that
is,
not
every
library
can
have
every
book.
something
has
got
to
be
excluded.
so
we
start
with
the
assumption
that
the
librarians
have
got
to
make
these
judgments.
we
don't
start
with
that
assumption
in
the
case
of
the
internet
at
all.
and
the
question
in
the
case
of
the
internet
is
the
different
one.
can
you
require
them
to
exclude
certain
materials
that
it
would
be
illegal
for
them
to
have
as...
as
an
abstract
matter?
sure,
i
suppose.
but
the...
the
tough
question
is,
can
you
require
them
necessarily
to
exclude
a
great
deal
more
about
which
they
make
no
decision
whatsoever
and
which
would
be
perfectly
legal
for
them
to
have?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
do
me
a
great
honor.
but
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
i
am
souter.
justice
david
h.
souter
if...
if
they
want
them.
but
you're...
but
you're
right,
sure.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
if
the...
what
if
the
facts
were
changed
in
this
way?
the
library...
i'm
sorry.
did
i...
no.
please
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
one
last
question
before
you
get
to
the
second
one.
what
if
the
library
said,
we're
not
letting
in
the
whole
internet?
we
think
there
are
some
sites
that
it
would
be
valuable
for
our
research
patrons
to
have.
we've
got
to...
we're
simply
going
to
select
100
websites
or
1,000
out
of
the
millions
that
are
there
and
we're
going
to
let
them
in.
would
that
be
a
violation
of
designated
public
forum?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
your
response
be
if...
if
you
start
where
mr.
olson
started
and
said,
you
don't
have
to
go
through
all
of
this?
all
you
have
to
do
is
walk
up
to
the
librarian
and
say,
i'm
an
adult.
i
want
it
unblocked.
and
it
will
be
unblocked.
where...
where
does
that
leave
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
think
mr.
olson's
suggestion
was
that
the
librarian,
absent
some
extraneous
reason,
would
say
yes.
so...
so
let's
add
that
to
the
mix.
the
librarian
says
yes,
unblock.
what
is...
where's
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
your
position--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
even
to
do
that
would
be
stigma?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
doesn't
solve
the
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
isn't
what
he
says.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
says,
look,
you
block
a
lot
of
stuff.
just
please
unblock
it.
