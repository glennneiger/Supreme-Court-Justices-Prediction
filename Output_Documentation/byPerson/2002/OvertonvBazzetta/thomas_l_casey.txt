mr.
thomas
l.
casey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
were
wrong
for
two
reasons.
first,
because
the
constitution
does
not
give
prison
inmates
a
right
to
receive
in-person
visits
since
that
activity
is
inherently
inconsistent
with
the
status
as
a
prisoner
and
with
legitimate
penological
objectives
and
second,
because
the
michigan
visitation
rules
are
rational
and
reasonably
related
to
legitimate
penological
interest.
the
court
has
recognized
the
right
of
intimate
association
with
certain
people
in
certain
circumstances
outside
of
the
prison
context
in
cases
such
as
roberts
v.
united
states
jaycees.
in
turner
v.
safley,
the
court
examined
the
question
of
how
to
evaluate
a
right
which
is
recognized
outside
of
the
prison
context
and
determine
whether
it
applies
inside
the
prison.
the
right
there
was
the
right
to
marry.
the
court
said
you
should
look
at
the
elements
or
incidents
of
the
rights
to
determine
whether
it
is
affected
by
incarceration
or
the
pursuit
of
legitimate
corrections
goals.
in
roberts,
the
court
also
identified
several
attributes
of
the
right
of
intimate
association
which
respondents
assert.
these
rights
include
a
high
degree
of
selectivity
and
decisions
regarding
the
affiliations,
seclusion
from
others,
relative
smallness
of
the
group.
our
contention
is
that
all
of
the
these
attributes
are
significantly
affected
by
incarceration
and
they
are
inherently
inconsistent
with
incarceration.
and
so
the--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--in...
the
right
to
have
the
relationship
which
is
what
was
actually
at
issue
in
safley
with
marriage
and
in
the
jones
case
with
prisoner...
with
the
union
membership.
that
status
can
survive.
there's
no
effect
on
the
relationship
here.
what
this
case
is
about
is
activity--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--noncontact
visits
but
it
involves
activities
inside
the
secure
prison
walls
in
furtherance
of
the
relationship.
there's
no
impact
on
the
relationship
itself,
the
question
is,
can
prison
officials...
do
the
necessities
of
prison
have
an
impact
on
the
right
of
association.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
relationships
that
the
prisoners
are
asserting
are
family
members
beyond
the
definition
of
the
michigan
prison
system...
has
adopted
particularly
minor
nieces
and
nephews.
one
of
the
problems
with--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--children
of
the
prisoner
are
included
within
the
definition--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--by
a
family
member
within
the
definition
or
a
legal
guardian,
that's
the
michigan
regulation.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
there
was
a
statute
passed,
right
at
the
close
of
the
district
court
opinion
that
permitted
the
department
to
permit
visits
by
siblings,
the
department
changed
the
regulation
to
include
siblings,
minor
sibling
visits,
so
that
issue
is
no
longer
before
the
courts.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
pardon.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that
is
the
class
with
respect
to
minor
children,
they
also
have
a
contention
about
former
inmates
and--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
prison
officials
testified
uniformly
that
there
were
serious
overcrowding
problems,
prison
management
problems,
concerns
about
safety,
so
the
overriding
interest
was
to
reduce
the
volume
of
visitors.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
to
keep
the
numbers
down,
the
department
is
permitted
to
draw
lines.
and
that
is
to
draw
a
line--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--oh,
absolutely.
that...
there
was...
there
is
extensive
testimony
that
not
only
was
there
a
problem
with
overcrowding
and
management,
just
because
of
the
volume
in
general,
but
particularly,
because
of
children.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
in
response
to--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
court
specified
three
issues
and
the
first
issue
is
whether
there
is
a
right
to
visitation
at
all.
our
position
on
that
question
is
there
is
no
constitutional
right.
it's
a
privilege.
it's
not
a
right.
the
second
question
was
whether
assuming
there
is
some
limited
right,
are
the
michigan
regulations
rational
and
reasonably
related
to
legitimate
correctional
goals.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
way
the
case
evolved...
the
regulations
on
their
face
apply
to
all
visitation.
the
restrictions
apply
to
both
contact
and
noncontact.
when
the
case
was
initially
filed,
there
were
motions
for
summary
judgment.
there
was
a
3-day
hearing
on
that
motion
and
most
of
the
testimony
that
was
introduced
related
to
contact
visitation.
so
when
the
case
first
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
mistakenly
viewed
the
case
was
relating
only
to
contact
visitation.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
there
were
statements
in
the
brief
referring
to
contact
visitation,
largely
because
that
was
the
evidence
that
was
adduced
at
the
summary
judgment
proceeding.
but
the
complaint
challenged
the
regulations
in
their
entirety.
and
the
parties,
i
believe,
understood
that
it
applied
to
both
contact
and
noncontact.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
in
the
court
of
appeals'
first
opinion
it
held
that
it
applied
only
to
contact.
then
it
went
back
to
the
district
court
and
then
we
had
longer
trial,
more
elaborative
evidentiary
proceeding.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
in
its
entirety
on
our
motion.
there
was
no
misrepresentation.
there
may
have
been
some
unintentional
statements
which
led
the
court
of
appeals
to
conclude
in
the
first
view--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
first
order
of
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
in
its
entirety.
and
the
complaint,
the
initial
complaint,
did
not
say
we
are
challenging
only
contact.
the...
as
i
say,
because
of
the
way
the
summary
judgment
evidence
went
in,
it
evolved
that
the...
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was
related
only
to
contact.
but
the
rules
on
their
face
don't
make
a
distinction
between
contact
and
noncontact.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
at
page
111
of
the
joint
appendix,
there's
a
memorandum
that
was
issued
in
april
of
1995,
which
sets
out
hours
of
visitation
for
different
institutions...
it
varies
between
institutions.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
and
it
varies...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that
would
have
been
one
solution.
the
department
chose
a
solution
where
they
evaluated
the
visitors
and
concluded
that
it
would
be
best
to
make
quality
visits
for
close
family
members
following
essentially--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--they
did
not
know
in
advance
how
many
nieces
and
nephews.
we
simply
don't
keep
that
kind
of
record.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
essentially
what
they
did.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
no.
that's--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--no,
that's
one
of
the
bases,
it
would
possible
to
prohibit
all
children
in
prisons.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
our
position.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
well,
i
thought
i
was,
i'm
sorry
if
i
didn't
make
that
clear,
your
honor.
the
department
made
decisions
on
who
is
to
visit.
and
they
said
we
are
going
to
permit
visits
with
close
family
members,
children,
grandchildren,
at
some
point
they
have
to
draw
a
line,
as
you've
said,
which
is
kind
of...
and
they
drew
a
line
to
eliminate
certain
extended
family
members.
one
of
the
problems
is...
is...
if
the
court
finds
that
there
is
a
right
to
visitation,
the...
there
will
be...
i
suspect
a
great
deal
of
additional
litigation
on
where
those
lines
can
appropriately
be
drawn.
michigan,
for
example,
has
very
generous
rules
concerning
times
of
visitation,
they
permit
visits
on
evenings,
on
weekends
and
holidays,
some
states
don't
do
that.
if
there's
a
right
to
visitation,
i
suspect
there
will
be
litigation
on--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--no.
there...
inmates,
for
example,
in
the
lowest
security
level
are
entitled
to
eight
visits
per
month.
and
the
time
is...
is
not
regulated
either.
it
depends
on
overcrowding
and
situations
like
that.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
rule
permits
an
inmate
to
designate
immediate
family
members
as
defined
by
the
department
and
10
other
individuals.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
now,
there
are
certain
prohibitions,
former
prisoners
are
prohibited,
i
think,
unless
they're
a
family
member
and
receive
the
ward's
permission.
that
is
being
challenged
here
as
well,
but--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--no,
it
includes
spouses,
but
it
would
include,
it
would
include--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
child
can
visit
if
the
child,
you
know,
is
the
biological
child,
but
the
child
has
to
be
brought
by
a
member
of
the
immediate
family.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
someone
other
than
the
unwed
mother
would
have
to
bring
that
child
under
the
rules.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
but
someone
other
than
the
unwed
father
would
have
to
bring--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--he
is
not
qualified--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--if
he
is
the
legal
guardian,
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
if
the
mother,
the
custodial
parent,
has
gone
through
legal
guardianship.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
guardian
in
fact,
perhaps,
but
the
department
is
permitted
to
insist
on
enough
evidence
to
demonstrate
the
legal
relationship.
and,
again,
this
case
is
about
drawing
lines,
and
the
prison
officials
here
drew
reasonable
lines
based
on
a
perception
that
they
observed
in--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--these
rules
could
be
challenged
as
an...
on
an
as-applied
basis
but
we
did
go
through
a
complete
trial
on
the
merits
here.
there
is
evidence.
our
position
is
we
submitted
evidence
to
demonstrate
the
reasonable
relationship
under
turner
v.
safley.
so
if
there
is
a
right,
then
we
satisfied
the
requirements
of...
of
permitting
our
rules
to
take...
to
take
a--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--yes.
it's
a
class
action.
inmates
and--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--she
was
an
inmate.
so...
i
have
not
addressed
the
court's
third
question,
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
if
there
are
no
questions
on
that,
i'll
rely
on
the
briefs.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
would
just
like
to
clear
up
a
couple
of
points
initially.
this
case
is
not
about
visits
from
lawyers
or
clergy.
it's
not
about
custody
level.
persons
can
be
or
prisoners
can
be
in
minimum
custody
level
and
still
have
these
visitor
restrictions.
so
when
justice
kennedy
referred
to
solitary
confinement,
justice
breyer,
excuse
me,
we're
not
talking
about
that.
we're
just
talking
about
visitation.
and
justice
ginsburg,
i
stand
by
my
earlier
statements
about
the
nature
of
the
arguments
in
the
initial
district
court
proceeding
as
it
proceeded
in
the
first
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
of
a
distinction
between
noncontact
and
contact
visits
simply
didn't
come
up
in
that...
in
the...
in
those
district
court
proceedings.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
our
initial
position,
yes.
the
limitation
to
contact...
or
to
noncontact
visits
is
not
a
panacea.
children
still
present
problems
of
the...
they
have
unique
risks
and
burdens.
when
a
guard
and
a
visitationer
is
watching
a
child,
they're
distracted
from
watching
some
other
visitation.
the
michigan
prison
system,
most
facilities
with
multicustody
levels
have
one
large
room
for
visitation.
they
have
tables
and
chairs
for
the
contact,
along
one
wall,
there
will
be
vending
machines
and
along
another
wall,
there
will
be
one
or
two
of
these
temporary
booths.
and
noncontact
prisoners
are
brought
through
the
contact
room
to
that
booth.
visitors
for
the
noncontact
prisoner
are
brought
through
the
contact
room.
there's
ample
opportunity
for
exchange
of
contraband
and
visibility
of
other
activity
that's
going
on
in
this
one
room.
with
respect
to
the
argument
about
content-neutral
regulations
regarding
children,
prison
officials
are
entitled
to
make
categorical
decisions.
the
decision
here
is
that
it's
better
to
permit
the
quality
close
visits
based
on
a
parent-child
relationship,
partly
because
of
limitations
on
time
as
justice
scalia
alluded
to,
there
were
overcrowding
problems
before
the
regulations
were
put
into
effect.
all
of
the
wardens
testified
after
the
regulations
were
put
into
effect,
the
conditions
were
noticeably
better.
in
closing,
i
would
just
like
to
emphasize,
that
the...
the
judgment
of
the
corrections
officials
here
was
a
valid
exercise
of
their
informed
discretion
regarding
the
conditions
of
confinements.
the
courts
should
have
deferred
to
that,
this
court
has
recognized
deferral
to,
deference
to
prison
officials
as
an
important
factor.
and
in
summary
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
would
be
happy
to.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the...
a
child
of
a
prisoner
is
entitled
to
visit
if
they're
brought
by
a
member
of
the
immediate
family
or
a
legal
guardian.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
