mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
right
asserted
here
for
inmates
to
receive
in-person
visits
other
than
those
permitted
by
corrections
department
rules
is
consistent
neither
with
inmate
status
nor
with
the
legitimate
penological
interests
underlying
michigan's
rules.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
is
our
initial
position,
yes.
and
we
also
have
two
backup
positions.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
not
necessarily.
the
fact
that
the
federal
constitution
itself
does
not
create
a
liberty
or
a
property
interest
in
visitation,
does
not
preclude
the
possibility
that
state
prison
regulations
or
state
law
might
create
that
type
of
interest.
it
could
not
be
taken
away
under--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
answer
is
not
necessarily.
and
that
is
the
court
would
have
to
examine
under
the
standards
established
by...
in
sandin
v.
conner,
whether
or
not
state
law
provides
a
property
or
a
liberty
interest
that
can't
be
taken
away
without
sufficient
process.
and
that--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
it's
not
a
question
of
what
the
content
of
the
regulations
are.
that
was...
sandin
v.
conner
got
rid
of
that
inquiry.
instead,
the
question
is
whether
it
is
a
grievous
deprivation
or
an
adverse...
or
excuse
me,
an
atypical
hardship
that
is
contrary
to
the
typical
norms
of
incarceration.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
we
think
that's
a
very
difficult
question.
if
push
came
to
shove,
our
answer
would
be
the
warden
should
have
that
discretion
but
i
should
point
out
that
bureau
of
prison
regulations
and
the
state
of
michigan
both
provide
extensive
hearing
procedures
before
such
rights
are
withdrawn.
and
such
that
the
type
of...
for
example,
in
michigan,
you
can
challenge
the
underlying
finding
of
misconduct
if
your
rights
are
going
to
be
taken
away
for
the
minimum
2-year
period
bound
that's
at
issue
here.
and
you
get
not
only
an
investigation,
you
get
a
hearing,
you
get
administrative
review,
you
get
judicial
review.
and
we
believe
that
those
types
of
procedures
are
certainly
sufficient
in
terms
of
due
process.
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be
if
push
came
to
shove,
we
would
say
no,
it
could
be
a
matter
of--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--on
two
bases,
justice
stevens.
first,
marriage
has
or
can
have
a
religious,
that
is
free
exercise
element,
and
it
also
has
an
effect
on
property
rights
and
the
rights
to
certain
benefits
outside
the
prison
context.
neither
is
true
of
the
right
to...
of
visitation.
second,
incarceration
as
a
form
of
punishment
necessarily
places
a
barrier
between
the
prisoner
and
those
with
whom
he
would
otherwise
associate.
the
very
essence
of
the
punishment
is
that
separation
and
the
vesting
of
control
over
exceptions
to
that
separation,
in
the
state
and
corrections
authority.
marital
status
in
contrast,
such
as
free
exercise
of
religion,
doesn't
have
the
necessary
relationship
to
incarceration
as
a
form
of
punishment.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it
is
a
universally
accepted
practice,
that
for
certain
prisoners
under
proper
conditions,
certain
visits,
will
aid
in
rehabilitation
and
that
is
the
accepted
view
and
one
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
firmly
supports.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
that,
justice
o'connor,
is
a
matter
of
penological
philosophy,
but
not
a
matter
of
constitutional
right.
and
as
a
matter
of
sound
penological
philosophy,
the
bureau
of
prisons,
for
example,
does
allow
visits.
but
it
will
restrict
those
visits
rather
severely
if
the...
if
the
circumstances
provide.
and
we
believe
that
one--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
your
honor,
you
could
decide
it...
actually
turner
v.
safley,
as
we
read
it
has
two
components.
on
page
95
in
particular,
it
says
that
an
inmate
retains
those
rights
that
are
not
inconsistent
with
incarceration
or
with
the
penological
interests
of
the
corrections
system.
and
so
we
believe
that
this
court
could
resolve
it
under
either
of
the
inconsistent-with-inmate
status
problem,
which
is
to
say
that
there
is
no
right.
or
it
could
go
into
the
turner
v.
safley
balancing
and
determine
that,
in
fact,
michigan's
rules
do
have
the
requisite
relationship
to
legitimate
penological
objectives.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
justice
breyer,
i
think
part...
when
you
say
communication,
i
wouldn't
go
that
far.
we
are
saying
that--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
in
fact,
what
incarceration
cuts
off
and
what
the
punishment
of
incarceration
is
is
the
physical
separation
of
the
inmate
from
the
rest
of
society.
the
inmate,
for
example,
it's
not
inconsistent,
for
example,
for
a
corrections
official
to
have
authority
to
give
an
inmate
a
furlough
to
go
outside
to
work
for
example.
but
it
is
inconsistent,
for
an
inmate
to
say
you
must
give
me
a
furlough
to
go
outside
because
your
failure
to
do
so
interferes
with
my
in-person
associational
rights.
the
very
essence--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
i
think
the
answer
is,
the
very
essence
of
the
punishment
of
incarceration
is
separation
from
society
and
the
vesting
of
exceptions
thereto
in
corrections
officials.
that
is
the
punishment
and
that
is
the
difference
between,
for
example,
a
broader
right
to
communicate,
which
wouldn't
necessarily
be
cut
off.
a
broader
right--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--absolutely.
that
is
the
nature
of
incarceration
as
punishment,
justice
scalia.
turning
to
the
turner
balance
argument--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--justice
kennedy,
solitary
confinement
should
be
distinguished
from
merely
cutting
off
visitors
from
outside.
and
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
yes,
under
certain
circumstances,
solitary
confinement
for
life
would
be
permissible,
but
one
would,
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
in
various
cases,
have
to--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
the
barrier
for
solitary
confinement
for
life
would
be
whether
or
not
that's
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
but
the
reality
of
prison
life
is
that
prisoners
don't
get
to
choose
who
their
cellmates
are.
they
don't
get
to
choose
who
they
bunk
with.
they
don't
get
to
choose
who
they
dine
with.
they
don't
get
to
choose
the
institution
in
which
they're
incarcerated.
even
though
each
of
those
personal
choices
may
be
protected
outside.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
in
this
case
the
prison
does
allow
phone
calls
for
outside,
which
are
other
means
by
which
general
first
amendment
community
rights--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
the
court--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
court
actually
addressed
that
in
pell,
which
is
to
say
that
that's
not
a
problem
unless
the
state
precludes
the
prisoner
from
getting
aid
in
writing
letters.
and
pell
actually
addressed
the
specific
claim
that
the
prisoners
were
unable
to
write.
and
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
state
precludes
prisoners
from
getting
aid
in
writing
or
reading
letters
so
that
they
may
communicate
with
the
outside
world.
but
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
exactly
the
line
we
draw,
justice.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no.
there
may
be...
there
may
or
is
a
distinct
first
amendment
and
societal
interest
in
allowing
general
communications
between
inmates
and
the
outside
world.
in
that
sense
it's
important
to
distinguish
between
the
two
rights
at
issue.
one
is
a
substantive
due
process
in-person
associational
right,
and
the
other
is
a
more
general
first
amendment
right
to
communicate
or
like
a
more
general
first
amendment
right
to
free
exercise
of
religion.
the
former
is
what
incarceration
cuts
off.
the
latter
is
something
that
incarceration
may
limit
but
generally
only
to--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes,
your
honor.
he
would
have
a
visit
from
the
lawyer
and
potentially
clergy
as
an
exception
as
well.
and
that's
because
of
the
distinct
and
hybrid
nature
of
the
right.
it's
not
merely
an
associational
right,
but
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
may
be
at
issue,
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances,
the
right
to
free
exercise
of
religion
may
also
be
at
issue
in
the
case
of
clergy.
that's
why
almost
all
of
these
limits,
except
clergy
and
lawyers.
turning
to
the
turner
balance,
the
court
below
invalidated
the...
these
rules
as
applied
to
noncontact
visits
based
on
the
principle
that
noncontact
visits
do
not
raise
the
penological
concerns
that
contact
visits
do.
that
was
incorrect
for
three
reasons.
first,
many
prisons
including
federal
bureau
of
prisons'
facilities,
lack
noncontact
facilities.
the
construction
of
new
facilities
is
not
the
type
of
de
minimis
or
ready
alternative
this
court
contemplated
in
turner.
second,
the
portable
noncontact
booths
used
by
the
state
of
michigan
separate
the
visitor
from
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no.
in
fact,
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons'
facilities,
if
they
are
high
security
or
pretrial
dissension
centers,
they
will
have
noncontact
facilities.
if
they
are
lower
security--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
facilities
in
these
cases...
may
i
answer
the
question,
chief
justice?
i
see
i'm
out
of
time.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
okay.
the
facilities
at
issue
in
these
cases
are
portable
booths,
which
separate
the
inmate
from
its
visitor
but
not
the
visitor
from
all
the
inmates
who
are
having
contact
visits
so
they
do
not
address
the
problems
of
the
child
visitors
having
contact
with
inmates.
