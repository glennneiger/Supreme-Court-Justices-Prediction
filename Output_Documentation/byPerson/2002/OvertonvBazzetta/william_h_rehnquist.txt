v.
michelle
bazzetta.
mr.
casey.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
exist
outside...
what
relationship
are
you
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
also
of
some
concern
with
the
activities
of
children
within
the
prison
as
opposed
to
adults?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
limit
on
the
number
of
times
the
same
person
can
come
in
a
given
month?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
particular
person
brought
this
action,
did
they
not?
michelle
bazzetta?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
she
was
an
inmate
somewhere?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
casey.
mr.
lamken.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
can.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
lamken.
ms.
labelle,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
case
go
to
the
sixth
circuit
twice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
particular
procedural
history
significant
in
what
we
decide
on
the
issues
before
us?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
happened
to
mrs.
bazzetta
who
wrote
this...
who
brought
this
action?
did
she
ask
for
all
these
things
and
was
denied
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
it
was
a
class
action.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
her
sister
wanted
to.
i
mean
shouldn't
her
sister
have
brought
the
action,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
bazzetta
is
the
inmate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
else
did
ms.
bazzetta
challenge
that
had
happened
to
her,
besides
the
visit
from
her
sister?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how...
how
can
one
of
them
represent
an
entire
class
then
if
each
of
them
is
challenging
something
different?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what,
where...
where--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--where
do
you
get
this
out
of
the
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
roberts
was
a
case
involving
whether
you
can
get
into
the
jaycees
or
not,
not
whether
you
could
get
out
of
prison.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
moore
was
a
zoning
case.
i
mean,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
prisons.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can't
they...
can't
they
regulate
categorically
rather
than
just
tuning
it
to
each
particular
family
to
say
that
your
own
children
are
in
a
different
class
than
siblings
or
nieces
or
nephews
and
say
one
can...
i
mean,
the
whole
thing
is
line-drawn.
you're
going
to
draw
lines
or
slice
somewhere
as
you
put
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
is
your
authority
for...
in
cases
from
this
court,
say,
for
the
content
neutral
principle?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
say
something
about
being
content-neutral?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
answer
the
question
briefly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
labelle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
casey,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
casey.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist

opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
