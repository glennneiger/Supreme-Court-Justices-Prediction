justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
specific
anti-niece...
i
didn't
understand
this
case,
i
guess.
i
thought
there's
a
simple
determination
by
the
prison
authorities,
we
don't
want
children
in
the
room,
period.
now,
we'll
make
an
exception
for
that
if
they're
your
children.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
had
nothing
to
do...
it
had
something
to
do
with
a
lot
of
people,
but
basically
they
think
children
are
more
dangerous
to
the
child
or
more
disruptive,
because
they're
younger,
harder
to
discipline,
they
might
run
around
in
the
room.
they
might
learn
things
that...
that
they
don't
want
children
exposed
to
the
language
or
behavior
of
the
prisoners,
et
cetera.
so
i
just
thought
it
was...
now
maybe
you're
telling
me,
no
no,
that's
not
the
reason
it
was
totally
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
quite
interesting
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
they
don't
prohibit
all
children.
they
say
generally
children
are
more
of
a
problem
than
adults
to
have
in
visits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
draw
a
line.
we
say
no
children
except
for
your
own
children.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
don't
you
defend
it
on
that
basis,
if
that's
what
it
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
to
the
first,
if
you're
right
on
the
first
point,
which
is
what
is
disturbing
about
the
first
point,
a
prisoner
would
have
no
right
whatsoever
to
any
kind
of
visit
or
communication
or
association
with
outside
people,
even
if
there
were
virtually
no
penological
reason
for
doing
that?
and
that's...
why
do
you
have
to
go
that
far?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
that
because
that's
what's
that
the
cases
seem
to
say.
communication,
association.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
thinking
of
cases
where
that's
justified
what
the
prison
is
doing.
and
if
you
win
on
your
first
point,
you
better
think
of
cases
where
the
prison
is
unjustified,
but
it
still
wins.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
that
is
true,
but
i
thought...
i
thought
that
this
case...
it's
much
more
complicated
than
i
thought.
i
thought
it
was
fairly
simple,
at
least
in
my
mind.
i
assume
with
you
that
turner
is
the
law
and
there's
some
kind
of
constitutional
right
here.
but
i
thought
we
had
basically
four
regulations,
one
says
no
children
can
visit
unless
they're
your
own
children.
the
second
one
says
no
prisoners
can
visit
unless
they're
in
your
family.
the
third
one
says
that
you
lose
those
rights
if
you're
on
drugs,
you
lose
them
for
two
years
if
you
have
two
drug
problems.
and
there
was
one
other,
which...
if
the
children
come
in,
they
have
to
be
accompanied
by
an
adult,
okay?
and
i
thought
that's
what
the
regs
say
and,
in
addition,
there's
another
reg
which
says,
warden,
if
you
feel
you
need
to
make
an
exception
for
a
particular
visit,
you
can
do
it.
okay?
now,
that's
what
the
regs
were,
the
district
court
said
those
are
unconstitutional.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that's
right
and
i
would
like
to
know,
assuming
with
you,
that
turner
is
the
law,
what's
unconstitutional
about
them?
it
strikes
me
as
the
most
reasonable
thing
to
say
that
you
can't
have
children
in
a
prison
environment
unless
they're
your
own
children.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they've
now
dealt
with
that,
i
take
it.
and
you're
saying
that...
that
we
should
decide
what
is
a
totally
hypothetical
thing,
whether
a
regulation
in...
are
they
seeking
damages?
i
take
it
they're
seeking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--an
injunction.
the
law
is
now
that
they
will
let
the
family
members
in,
if
you
have
a
brother
who's
2
years
old,
they
can
bring
the
brother.
so...
so
i
would
think
that's
pretty
hypothetical,
but
any
way,
i'll
consider
that.
what
about
the
rest
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
say,
sure,
it's
reasonable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sure
it's
reasonable.
the
reasonable
thing
is
we
want
as
few
children
as
possible.
but
we're
not
prepared
to
say,
if
they're
your
own
children,
you
can
never
see
them.
that
to
me
sounds
like
a
reasonable
thing.
why
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
of
course.
you
say
nieces
and
nephews
are
the
same
as
a
child,
that
i
guess,
that's
a
matter
of
judgment.
and
i
take
it
i
can
imagine
a
case
where
a
person
and
who
is
a
prisoner
would
have
the
same
relationship
with
let's
say
a
foster
step-child
or
something
that
he's
raised
that
i
might
have
or
you
might
have
with
a
natural
child.
but
that's
why
i
thought
there
is
a
reg
here
that
permits
the
warden
to
make
exceptions
in
unusual
cases.
now,
why
isn't
that
good
enough?
so
that
if
the
warden
turns
a
person
down,
where
that
is
the
relationship,
then
that
person
could
complain
about
it
and
bring
a
lawsuit
rather
than
striking
down
the
whole
reg.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
mean
they
couldn't?
the
children
couldn't
visit...
i'm
now
confused
about
the
facts.
i
have
a
reg
in
front
of
me,
by
the
way,
which
says
the
warden
may,
quote,
allow
a
single
visit
between
a
person
and
a
prisoner
and
a
person
not
on
the
approved
visitor's
list
as
long
as
it's
in
the
best
interests
of
the
prisoner
and
there's
no
threat
to
order
and
security.
now,
why
is
it
that
that
reg
doesn't
give
the
warden
the
power
to
deal
with
unusual
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
said
there's
no
exception,
if,
in
fact,
a
prisoner
has
raised
a
6-year
old
child
just
as
it's
his
own
child,
but,
in
fact,
there's
no
formal
adoption
paper.
so
there's
testimony
that
he
would
never
let
that
child
in?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
concerned...
although
i
believe
you
also
said
that
there
were...
their
own
children
weren't
allowed
in.
what's
the
example
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no...
so,
in
other
words,
you
have
to
be
the
legal
guardian
of
the
child
if
it's
not
your
child,
in
order
to
have
a
visit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
this
case...
this
case,
in
other
words,
it
sounds
to
me
from
having
listened
to
it
and
looked
at
it
a
little
bit,
it's
a
kind
of
litigation
problem,
i
mean,
there's
a
long
litigation
history
here
of
contention.
and
perhaps
extreme
positions.
but
given
that,
is
it
up
to
us
to
say,
could
we
say,
look,
on
their
face,
these
regs
are
okay,
under
turner?
if
they're
not...
if
they're
being
applied
in
a
way
that
makes
really
very
little
sense,
let
the
individual
who
has
this
unusual
situation
of
the,
you
know,
adopted
child
or
something
like
that,
let
him
ask
for
the
visit,
let
him
ask
for
an
exception
to
be
made,
if
necessary,
and
then
if
that
doesn't
happen,
and
i
would
imagine
normally,
if
calm
prevails,
it
would
happen,
but
if
it
didn't
happen,
then
he
could
bring
his
case.
or
if
there
is
such
a
person
in
this
case,
you
could
proceed
with
that
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
limitation
by
the
way
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
have
a
minute,
i
have
one
factual
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
from
the
brief
from
the
respondents,
i
just
want
this
clarified,
there
are
a
certain
number
of
prisoners
who
have
families
and
they
have
children,
but
they
aren't
legally
married.
now
from
the
briefs,
i
had
the
impression
that
visits
are
allowed
by
those
children,
even
though
they're
not
legally
married,
unless
parental
rights
have
been
terminated.
but
from
respondents'
argument,
i
had
the
impression
that
you
could
not
have
a
visit
from
such
a
child,
period,
unless
you
went
through
some
formal
adoption
procedure.
which
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whether
they're
married
or
not
married?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
