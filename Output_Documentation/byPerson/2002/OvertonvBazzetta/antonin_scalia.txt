justice
antonin
scalia
it
limits
the
number
at
any
one
time.
but
does
it
limit,
you
know,
you
can
only
have
so
many
visitors
a
month?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
sufficient
to
solve
the
problem
of
overcrowding
and
too
many...
too
many
people?
if...
if
you
have
too
many
people,
an
easy
way
to
solve
it
is
just
to
reduce
the
number
of
visits
each
one
of
the
inmates
is
allowed
to
have
per
month.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
adults
are
permitted?
suppose
i
don't
have
any
children,
i
don't
have
any
spouse,
i
don't
even
have
any
siblings.
justice
antonin
scalia
ten
others,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
he's
the
guardian?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he's
the
legal
guardian,
he
would?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
close
enough
family
relationship
despite
the
lack
of
the
wedding
bond,
he
would
probably
be
the
guardian,
i
would
guess,
wouldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say
that
even
if...
even
if
the
prison...
even
if
the
prison
administration
is
unjustified
in
refusing
to
allow
the
prison
a
furlough
out
into
society,
even
if
a
thoroughly
trustworthy
prisoner,
you
would
still
say
he
has
no
right
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
unconstitutional
then,
and
this
is
why
i'm
reluctant
to
get
this
court
into
a
whole
new
line
of
constitutional
law...
is
it
unconstitutional
to
send
a
prisoner
from
the
east
coast
to
a
prison
far
removed
from
his
family
and
friends?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
targeting
the
rights.
their
object
is
not
to
cut
off
those
rights.
their
object
is
to
reduce
the
number
of
children
in
the
room,
to
reduce
the
number
of
visitors,
just
as
in
the
other
case,
their
object
is
to
use
prison
facilities
that
are
more...
that
are
cheaper,
that
are...
that
are
more
readily
available,
so
they
send
the
inmates
somewhere
else.
but
if
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
the...
to
the
visitations
you're
talking
about,
it
doesn't
seem
right
to
me
that
you
should
be
able
to
be
removed
from
the
people
who
could
possibly
visit
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
going
to
have
to
pass
on
one
by
one
nieces,
nephews,
grandchildren,
illegitimate
children,
children
of...
one
by
one,
all
of
these
are
constitutional
questions,
on
the
theory,
i
suppose,
that
what
is
truly
stupid
must
be
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
turner
assumes
the
question
that
we've
been
immediately
discussing,
that
there
is
a
fundamental
right.
before
you
get
to
the
turner
questions,
you
have
to
establish
that
there
is
a...
aright
to...
to...
to
visitation
in
prison.
if
you
talk
about
intimate...
the
right
to
intimate
family
association,
i
suppose
there
is
no
more
stronger
right
to
intimate
family
association
than
the
right
of...
of...
of
a
man
and
wife
to
cohabit,
and
that's...
that's
eliminated
in
prison,
unless
you
think
that
conjugal
visits
are
constitutionally
required.
do
think
that
they're
constitutionally
required?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
pretty
intimate
family
association
that
you're
cutting
off
there,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
arrange
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
arrange
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
ms.
labelle,
once
you
leap
over
the...
the
prior
constitutional
question,
as
justice
breyer
has
and
go
immediately
to
turner
v.
safley,
we
are
in
the
line-drawing
business.
and
it
becomes
a
constitutional
question,
whether
it
is
unreasonable
to
exclude
an
nephew
or
a
niece
or
somebody
who
has
this,
is
as
close
to
the
prisoner
as
a
child
might
be.
why
do
we
want
to
get
in
this
line-drawing?
why...
what
is
the
problem
here?
is
there
any
real
risk
that
prisons
are
going
to
arbitrarily
and
unreasonably
limit
visitation?
would...
would
any
prison...
or
any
person
trying
to
manage
a
prison
without...
without
a
revolt
arbitrarily
cut
off
visitation?
it
seems
to
me
a
problem
in
search
of
a
solution.
justice
antonin
scalia
solution
in
search
of
a
problem.
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
think
that's
fair?
you
think
that's
fair?
i
have
children
that
want
to
visit
me.
they
are
my
children
in...
in
a
stable
wedlock
situation,
they
can't
visit,
because
we've
adopted
an
absolute
number
of
children
and
and
some
of
my
coprisoners
whose
nieces
and
nephews
want
to
visit,
they
have
been
visiting,
so
i
can't
see
my
kids?
does
that
seem
fair
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
want
an
absolute
number.
kids
are
kids.
so
since
some
of
my
coprisoners
are
seeing
nieces
and
nephews,
i
can't
see
my
children.
there
are
just
too
many.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
occur?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
would
be
anything
under
nine
just
on--
--you
put
me
in
prison,
you
got
big
troubles.
