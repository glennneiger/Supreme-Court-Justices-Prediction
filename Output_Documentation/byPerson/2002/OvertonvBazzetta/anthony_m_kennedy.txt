justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
your
initial
position,
in
your
view,
under
a
scheme
like
this
could
complete
discretion
be
given
to
the
warden
to
determine
who
gets
the
visitation
and
who
does
not?
you
know,
you
didn't
really...
you've
been
looking
sloppy
for
a
couple
of
days
so
i'm
going
to
take
away
your
visiting
privileges?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
it
isn't
an
issue
here.
but
one
of
the
reasons
i'm
asking
is
because
if
the
warden
doesn't
have
complete
discretion,
then
that
indicates
that
maybe
there's
some
right
that's
either
conferred
by
the
statute
or
by
the
constitution.
you
say
the
warden
has
complete
discretion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
you
read
these
regulations,
does
the
warden
have
the
complete
discretion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
under
that
standard,
do
you
think
the
warden
should
have
complete
discretion
to
deny
anybody
for
any
reason
visiting
privileges?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
under
all
circumstances
under
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
they
do
it
for
the
purpose
of
denying
the
prisoner
the
contact?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
involves
a
constitutional
challenge
to
regulations
in
the
state
of
michigan.
those
regulations
are
promulgated
by
the
michigan
prison
officials
and
they
limit
noncontact
visits
with
the
inmates
in
the
state
prisons.
an
increasing
number
of
prison
visitors
were
causing
difficulties
for
prison
officials
in
maintaining
security
and
controlling
drug
use
within
the
prisons.
so,
michigan
promulgated
these
regulations
which
limit
visitation.
each
inmate
now
may
receive
visits
only
from
individuals
on
an
approved
list.
the
list
may
include
an
unlimited
number
of
immediate
family
members
plus
ten
others.
minors
may
visit
only
if
they
are
children,
grandchildren,
or
siblings
of
the
inmate
which
excludes
nieces
and
nephews.
they
may
visit
only
when
accompanied
by
a
guardian
or
an
immediate
family
member.
a
child
may
not
visit
if
the
inmateâ€™s
parental
rights
have
been
terminated.
a
former
prisoner
may
not
visit
unless
he
is
an
immediate
family
member
of
the
inmate
and
the
warden
approves.
prisoners
who
incur
two
substance
abuse
infractions
in
prison,
that
is
drugs
or
alcohol,
may
not
receive
any
visitors
except
clergy
and
lawyers
but
they
may
seek
reinstatement
of
their
visitation
privileges
after
two
years.
when
a
group
of
prisoners
and
their
friends
and
family
members
sued
the
prison
official
under
section
1983
to
challenge
the
regulation
the
district
court
certified
the
matter
as
a
class
action
and
the
class
contended
the
regulations
as
they
pertain
to
these
noncontact
visits
violate
a
constitutional
right
to
intimate
association
and
that
the
limits
on
visits
for
inmates
with
substance
abuse
infractions
violated
the
eight
amendment
cruel
and
unseal
punishment
clause
as
well.
the
district
court
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
held
the
restrictions
on
noncontact
visits
to
be
unconstitutional
and
we
now
reverse.
although,
we
have
said
that
the
constitution
protects
certain
kinds
of
highly
personal
relationships,
in
this
case,
we
need
not
explore
or
define
the
asserted
association
right
or
determine
the
extent
to
which
it
survives
incarceration.
that
is
because
the
challenge
regulations
do
bear
a
rational
relation
to
legitimate
penalogical
interest.
we
find
the
regulations
are
valid
under
the
criteria
set
forth
in
one
of
the
important
cases
in
this
area
issued
by
this
court,
a
case
called
turner
versus
safley,
and
the
opinion
recites
all
of
the
tests
of
turner
versus
safley
and
applies
them
to
these
regulations,
the
restriction
on
visits
by
children
not
related
to
the
legitimate
interest
in
prison
security
and
protecting
children
from
exposure
to
harmful
inmate
conduct,
the
prohibition
on
visits
by
former
inmates.
there
is
a
self-evident
connection
to
the
legitimate
interests
in
prison
security
and
deterrence
of
future
crimes.
the
restrictions
on
visits
by
inmates
with
substance
abuse
violations
serves
the
goal
of
deterring
the
use
of
drugs
and
alcohol
in
prison.
this
is
particularly
true
with
high-risk
inmates
who
are
already
subject
to
severe
restriction
and
if
we
were
to
say
that
there
could
be
on
added
restrictions
on
visitation
for
use
of
drug
and
alcohol,
there
would
be
a
little
incentive
for
those
prisoners
to
follow
these
rules,
and
furthermore
accommodating
the
asserted
rights
would
cause
significant
allocation
and
reallocation
of
prison
financial
resources
and
would
impair
the
ability
of
officials
to
protect
those
inside
the
prison
walls.
for
these
and
other
reasons
set
forth
in
the
opinion,
the
regulation
satisfied
the
turner
test.
they
are
not
invalid
on
their
face.
if
the
withdrawal
of
all
visitation
periods
were
permanent
or
for
a
much
longer
period
or
applied
in
an
arbitrary
manner
to
a
particular
inmate,
the
case
would
present
different
considerations.
the
claims
here,
however,
do
not
support
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
entire
regulation
is
invalid,
and
we
also
hold
that
the
regulations
do
not
impose
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
the
regulations
do
not
create
unconstitutional
conditions
of
confinement
violating
the
eight
amendment.
we
do
not
hold
and
we
do
not
imply
that
any
right
to
intimate
association
is
altogether
terminated
by
incarceration
or
is
always
irrelevant
to
claims
made
by
prisoners.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
souter,
ginsburg,
and
breyer
join;
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
scalia
joins.
