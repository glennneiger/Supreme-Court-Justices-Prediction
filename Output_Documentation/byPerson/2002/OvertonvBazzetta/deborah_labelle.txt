ms.
deborah
labelle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court.
the
court...
i
would
like
to
clarify
quickly
the
administrative
proceedings
before
we
got
to
trial
in
this
court,
because
the
court
asked
an
inquiry.
we
did
have
a
3-day
trial
and
a
preliminary
injunction
hearing
and
at
that
time
the
corrections
department
represented
that
the
rules
were
only
as
to
contact
visits
and
the
court,
recognizing
that
there
were
some
smuggling
and
contraband
issues,
thereafter
denied
a
preliminary
injunction
and
followed
with
the
summary
judgment,
summary
disposition
based
solely
on
the
understanding
that
it
was
limiting...
these
rules
only
limited
contact
visits.
and
that's
how
it
went
to
the
sixth
circuit.
ms.
deborah
labelle
no.
the
district
court
ruled
only
with
regard
to
thinking
it
was
contact
and
the
sixth
circuit
accepted
it
that
way,
when
it
became
clear,
when
it
was
sent
down,
that
the
visits
were
being
applied
to
ban
all
visits
for
certain
categories
of
people,
we
asked
for
a
rehearing
in
the
sixth
circuit,
they
used
a
clarifying
opinion
and
then
said
that,
no,
the
justification
is
given
for
limiting
contact
visits,
smuggling
and
contraband
did
not
suffice
for
limiting
all
visits
for
these
categories
of
visitors.
ms.
deborah
labelle
yes,
your
honor.
it
went
to
the
sixth
circuit
after
a
whole...
first
on
the
initial
preliminary
injunction,
then
it
went
back
down,
it
was
tried
on
the
issue
of
noncontact
visits
and
the
permanent
ban.
the
permanent
ban,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
not
tried
in
the
first
go-around,
because
they
indicated
that
they
had
not
yet
implemented
it
in
any
form,
so
it
was
not
yet
right.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
that
it
is
not
significant,
only
to
clarify
one
point,
the
issue
of
whether
the
siblings
are
before
this
court.
it
was
after
the
district
court's
decision
that
the
department
chose
to
pass...
that
a
rule
was
passed
voluntarily
allowing
the
department
to
allow
siblings
in,
which
they
have,
but
they
have
put
a
position
throughout
the
case
and
up
through
the
sixth
circuit
that
they
had
the
right,
at
any
time,
to
withdraw
that
voluntary
choice
to
allow
siblings.
so
i
think
the
siblings
issue
is
still
very
much
before
this
court.
ms.
deborah
labelle
that's
correct,
your
honor,
including
siblings,
children,
that
it
is
all
a
matter
of
discretion.
ms.
deborah
labelle
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
that
is
why
the
case
has
gotten
so
far.
it
is
because
that
the
insistence
that
families
and
prisoners
do
not
retain
the
rights
of
intimate
association
past
the
prison
door.
ms.
deborah
labelle
certainly
not,
justice
scalia.
ms.
deborah
labelle
because
that
is
a
collateral
consequence
of
something
that
happens
to
prisoners.
they
get
moved.
they
get
transferred.
this
court
addressed
that
in
olim.
that's
not
what
happened.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
that
if
they
are
targeting
the
intimate
associational
rights
at
issue,
if
that
is
the
purpose
that
we
are
going
to
target
the
intimate
associational
rights,
then
a
fundamental
right
has
arisen
and
then
it's
a
turner
question.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
that,
your
honor,
what's
going
on
here
is
that
the
decision
to
slice
deeply
into
the
family
and
to
make
that
decision
as
to
who
gets
to
visit
and
who
doesn't
goes
directly
to,
and
that's
exactly
what
they
did,
they
said,
here
are
minors
and
we're
going
to
select
out
certain
intimate
associations,
we're
going
to
slice--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
you
don't
have
to
for
two
reasons,
your
honor.
one
i
think
if
this
court
affirms
that
the
intimate
associational
rights
that
are
at
issue
here
do
pass
through
the
doors
for
the
families,
that
you
will
have
departments
of
corrections
exercising
their
discretion
and
their
expertise
under
turner,
which
they're
allowed
to
do,
something
that
is
clearly
not
evident
here.
they
didn't...
there
is
no
expertise
in
their
decision.
ms.
deborah
labelle
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--thank
you,
your
honor.
with
regard
to
the
categorical
restrictions,
they
are
challenged
as
both
facially
and
as-applied
under
turner,
because
i
think
turner
is
a
very
fact-intensive
question.
ms.
deborah
labelle
the...
your
honor,
the...
it
was
a
class
action.
and
she
represented--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--one
of
the...
what
happened
is
that
she...
her
sister
wanted
to
bring
in
her
newborn
child
to
visit
ms.
bazzetta
and
that
would
have
been
the
nieces
and
nephews
which
were
precluded.
there
were
other
class
representatives--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--the...
ms.
bazzetta
was
denied
the
visit
with
her
niece
and
nephew.
her
sister
was
also
a
class
representative.
ms.
deborah
labelle
is
the
inmate.
there
were...
the
class
representatives
were
both
the
prisoners
on
the
inside
and
the
family
members
on
the
outside
who
joined
together
to
bring
this
action.
ms.
deborah
labelle
ms.
bazzetta
challenged
only
the
denial
of
her
ability
to
see
her
nieces
and
nephew.
ms.
barker
challenged
the
ability
to
see
her
children.
ms.
barker
challenged--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--we
had
class
representatives,
your
honor,
that
were
certified
as
adequate
to
represent
each
of
the
interests
in
which
we
presented
to
the
court.
ms.
deborah
labelle
with
regard
to
the
categorical
restrictions
on
the
minor
siblings,
children,
nieces
and
nephews,
it
is
both
a
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
claim
of
intimate
association,
and
family
association.
and
what
we
have
said
here
is
that
the
department
can
make
its
decisions
to
limit
people.
they
can
do
it
either
neutrally
by
volume,
they
can
say
we're
going
to
say
neutrally
that
you
can
only
have
so
many
minors,
just
as
they
do
adults.
you
can
only
have
so
many
minors
come
to
visit
at
any
time
and
we
are
not
going
to
slice
into
who...
who
is
your
most
intimate
family
member.
or
we
can
do
it
with
regard
to
the
further-out
reaches,
which
is
they
can
say
cousins,
i
suppose,
or
even
further,
but
they
can't
go
into--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
that
i
get
it
from
the
court's
decisions
in
moore,
in
roberts
and
that
this
court
has
already
said
that--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
that
you're
correct,
your
honor,
in
that
the
roberts
edicta,
which
everyone
has
relied
upon
in
this
case,
is
what
i'm
referring
to.
but
moore
directly
says
that
you
have
to
protect
certain
intimate
family
relationships
and
by
anyone's
understanding
of
what
it
means
to
be
family--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--it
had
nothing
to
do
with
prisons,
your
honor,
but
it
did
identify
that
there
are
intimate
associational
rights
involved
in
families
choosing--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
that...
i
think
that
turner
is
the
governing
case
in
here
and
in
fact,
i
think
if...
further
that
if
these
rules,
if
this
is
not
affirmed
it
would
be...
do
great
damage
to
the
turner
case,
because
what
turner
says
is
when
you
have
these
fundamental
rights,
that
then
you
look
to
extreme
deference
to
the
corrections
department.
ms.
deborah
labelle
no,
i
don't
think--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
that
although
some
states
certainly
allow
it,
it's
certainly
not
constitutionally
required,
because
there
is
two
prongs
of
turner.
one
is
whether
it...
it
is
inconsistent
with
incarceration
and
certainly
you
can
argue
that
people
going
outside
the
prison,
the
conjugal
visits
puts
certain
burdens
and
may
be
inconsistent
with
the
general
incarceration.
ms.
deborah
labelle
if
every--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--you
can
arrange
for
it.
and
i
think
that
you
would
not
win
under
a
turner
test
with
that
limit
on
that
associational
right.
but
here
where
they
have
impinged
on
the
associational
and
intimate
associational
right
in
such
a
way
but
if--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--yes,
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the...
this...
this
court
has
on
the
outside
recognized
that
we
have
intimate
association
rights,
we
have
companionship
rights.
and
although
they
may...
there
may
be
attributes
of
that
right,
that
are
necessarily
diminished
by...
by
having
one
member
of
your
family
in
prison,
the
many
attributes
of
what
it
means
to
be
a
family
is
not
gone.
the
ability
to
see
your...
your
wife's
face,
the
ability
to
see
your
child
and
assure
that
you're--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--and
i
think,
justice
breyer,
what's
wrong
with
that
is
that
it's
not
the
business
of
the
department
of
corrections
to
start
making
decisions
once
you
decide
that
family
members
and
children
can
come
in,
that
to
make
decisions
as
to
which
family
members
are
close...
which...
for
those
people
who
are
18,
17,
16,
who
have
no
children
but
wanted
to
see
their
only
family
member,
which
was
their
brother
or
sister,
the
questions--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--no.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
that
the
question
is
whether
it's
reasonable
to
slice
off
certain
family
members
and
there's
a
penological--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--interest
in
doing
it.
ms.
deborah
labelle
because
it
is
total
discretion
on
what
constitutes
the
family
and
who
comes
in
and
it
interferes
with
the
fundamental
right
at
issue
here
which
is--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
that's
true
that
you
can
draw
lines,
and
you
can
draw
lines
that
are
content-neutral
with
regard
to
the
family,
because
that's
what
the
concern
was
here,
volume.
so
you
can
say,
you
can
only
have
two
minors,
or
you
can
only...
on
your
list,
or
you
can
only
have
five
minors
visit
or
we're
going
to
limit
the
number
or
they
can
say,
we
are
only
going
to
protect
the
recognized
intimate
associations
which
include
your
children,
your
grandchildren,
your
siblings
and
your
nieces
and
nephews.
ms.
deborah
labelle
the...
the
record
in
this
case
is
that
the
warden
had
neither
discretion
or
at
least
the
wardens
that
testified
felt
they
had
neither
discretion
to
allow
minor
siblings
in
and...
or
do
they
have
any
discretion
whatsoever
with
regard
to
the
permanent
ban.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
that,
your
honor,
they
did
arbitrarily
here,
they
denied
all
minor
siblings--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--they
denied...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
they
denied
all
minor
siblings
coming
in.
they
restricted
who
can
bring
the
child
in
to
such
an
extent
that
there
were...
that
children
were
no
longer
allowed
to
come
in
to
visit
their
parents.
they
denied
all
biological
children.
ms.
deborah
labelle
the
testimony
of
the
warden
was
if
you
were
not
on
the...
the
visiting
list,
your
honor,
you
could
come
in
during
the
time
that
you
were
waiting
to
get
cleared.
but
if
by
policy
you
were
prohibited
from
coming
in,
if
you
were
a
minor
sibling--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--the
testimony
of
the
warden
was
that
if
by
policy
you
were
prohibited,
then
there
could
be
no
exception
to
policy.
there
could
be--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--there's
testimony
that...
that
there
was
no
ability
for
wardens
to
make
exceptions
with
regard
to
policy
decisions.
if,
in
fact,
the
person
had
not
yet
been
able
to
clear
and
be
put
on
the
visiting
list,
but
they
were
allowed,
those
exceptions
could
be
made,
but,
for
example,
the...
the
prisoner
whose
younger
brother
was
begging
to
come
in
after
their
mother
had
died
and
this
was
his
only
relative,
the
warden
testified
she
could
not
make
an
exception
to
that.
ms.
deborah
labelle
the
example
of
that
was
actually
that
there
was...
some
testimony
with
regard
to
justice
ginsburg's
example
with
regard
to
the...
the
father
of
the
child
who
was
unwed
could
not...
and
who
had
custody
of
the
child
but
was
not
the
legal
guardian
could
not
bring
the
child
in
to
visit.
there
are
many--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--if
you
were
not...
no.
even
if
it
is
your
child,
your
biological
child,
you
must
be
the
legal
guardian,
if
you
are
not
married.
so
that
if
you're
not
married,
you
cannot
bring...
the
parent
can't
bring
the
child
in
to
visit
the
other
parent,
unless
you
go
through
the
full
legal
guardianship
proceedings.
and--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--correct,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think...
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
because
it's
not
a
right
to
visit,
you
do
have
a
right
on
the
outside
to
that
intimate
association.
if...
and
here,
i
mean
you're
not
precluded
from
intimate
association
with
your
biological
child
and
the
parent,
the
legal
parent,
can
make
a
decision
can
make
a
decision
as
to
whether--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
the
protection
for
intimate
association
on
the
outside
is
not
limited
to
legal
relationships.
in
here
are
legal
parents
on
the
outside
who
are
members
of
this
class,
and
who
were
class
representatives
saying,
listen,
the
adoption
here
was
an
open
adoption.
we
all
agreed
that
this
child,
in
the
best
interests
of
this
child,
that
it
should
see
it...
his
or
her
natural
parent.
and
i'm
making
a
decision
that
it's
in
the
best
interests
of
this
child
to
come
in
and
visit.
and
it's
the
prison
saying...
and
i
have
to
say
the
prison
didn't
say
there's
some
reason
for
us
to
do
this.
they
said
we
never
thought
about
it.
we
really--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--your
honor,
assuming
the
right
that
exists
and
we
go
to
turner--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
there
has
to
be
some
reasonable
justification
for
infringing
on
the
right.
in
the
case
of,
for
example,
the
biological
children,
the
guardianship...
which
is
not
just
one,
your
honor,
but
20
percent
of
the
women
in
prison
have
their
kids
in
foster
care
or
people
who
cannot
bring
them.
we're
not
talking
about
one
or
two.
we're
talking
about
hundreds
of
people
here.
to
the
extent
that
they
have
any
reason,
but
what
they
said
is
we
just
didn't
think
about
it.
they
didn't
exercise
their
expertise.
ms.
deborah
labelle
yes,
because
that
was
the
concern
articulated.
if,
in
fact...
i
suppose
there
could
be
one
exception.
if
in
fact,
there
was
some
evidence
of
a...
of
a
wild
minor
sibling
smuggling
ring
and
there
was
some
basis
to
target
certain
individuals,
they
could
do
it.
but
what
they
said--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--correct,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
that
the...
the
authority
is...
is
turner
itself,
because
what
they
said--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--no,
but
it
did
say
what
you
have
to
do
is
compare
the
rationale
for
the
regulation
that
infringes,
you
have
to
see
if
there's
a
reasonable
penological
purpose,
are
there
alternatives
and
look
at
the
balancing.
ms.
deborah
labelle
the...
the
rules
themselves,
the
time,
place
and
manner
restriction.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
that
that
wouldn't
occur,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
labelle
because,
first
if,
in
fact,
you
limited
the
number
of
children
down
to
such
a
minuscule
amount
of
minors
that
had
no
relationship
with
their
concerns
with--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--but
they
allow
that
amount,
your
honor.
what
they
said
was
we
need
to
reduce
volume
by
10
to
15
percent.
and
we
had
absolutely
no
problem
with
the
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions
it
did
so.
what
they
did
by
this
sort
of
overbreadth
and
basically
because
they
felt
there
were
no
rights
at
issue
here,
they
reduced
it
over
50
percent.
there's...
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
to
see
if
there's
a
reasonable
relationship
here.
ms.
deborah
labelle
--and
there's
not.
ms.
deborah
labelle
no,
your
honor.
go
ahead.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
that
the...
what
they
do
is,
for
adults,
there's
a
10
limit
there.
ms.
deborah
labelle
yes,
absent
there
being
a
rationale
or
a
specific
security
concern,
which
is--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
that
if
you're
doing
a
categorical
restriction,
it
is
their
burden.
if
they're
doing--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--no,
i
think
that
you
can
have
individual
requirements
as
many
states
do
with
regard
to
a
rational
basis
to
say
someone
who
has
been
out
of
this
prison
for
6
months,
we're
not
going
to
allow
you
to
come
in,
because
it's...
there's
a
rational
basis.
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
because--
ms.
deborah
labelle
--i
think
that
because
there
was
absolutely
no
basis,
the
only
concerns...
i
think
because
it
was
a
different...
a
deference
to
the
different
concerns
articulated,
the
concern
with
regard
to
minors
was
simply
volume.
there
was
no
articulation
that
any
particular
group
of
minors
raised
any
specific
concern.
ms.
deborah
labelle
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
labelle
may
i
answer
the
question,
your
honor?
ms.
deborah
labelle
i
think
that
the
general
right
there
was
both
a
general
associational
right
that
you
have
to
companionships
with
loved
ones
as
well
as
an
equal
protection
argument.
ms.
deborah
labelle
thank
you,
your
honor.
