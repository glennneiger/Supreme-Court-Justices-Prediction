well,
does
the
right
to
association
while
in
prison
survive
in
some
form,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
noncontact
visits,
aren't
we
talking
about
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
presumably
children
of
the
prisoner
are
included,
are
they
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
are
limited...
they
have
to
be
accompanied
by,
what
is
it,
a
legal
guardian?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
have
a
fallback
position
from
that?
and
if
so,
what
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
a
facial
challenge
not
as
an
as-applied?
would
an
as-applied
challenge
be
possible,
assuming
we
recognize
some
right
of
visitation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
all
prisons
allow
some
form
of
visitation
for
prisoners?
isn't
that
a
pretty
universally
accepted
practice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
if
you're
going
to
release
somebody
back
into
society,
you
don't
want
to
cut
off
all
contact
with
family
members
or
friends
who
might
help
that
person
on
release,
do
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
isn't
the
turner/safley
rule
quite
adequate
here
to
deal
with
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
presumably,
the
prison
allows
prisoners
to
send
mail?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
how
about
phone
calls?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
a
prisoner
who
doesn't
know
how
to
read
and
write
and
who
has...
whose
family
has
no
telephone,
what
are
they
supposed
to
do
without
a
contact
visit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
a
noncontact
visit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what...
what
is
the
basis
of
the...
is
this
some
kind
of
a
facial
challenge
to
the
whole
scheme
of
regulating
noncontact
visits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
it?
is
it
an
as-applied
challenge,
of
some
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
claim
a
first
amendment
claim
or
what?
what...
what
is...
what
provisions
of
the
constitution
specifically
are
you
looking
to?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but...
but
when
in
the
prison
context,
we've
had
specific
cases
and
have
tried
to
articulate
some
governing
principles
outlined
largely
in
turner
v.
safley
about
what
the
prison
can
do
and
not
do.
should
we
just
look
to
that
case
and
analyzing
this
rather
than
the...
some
zoning
cases
and
other
things?
