justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
casey,
i
would
like
to
back
up
to
go
where
you
were
when
you
were
responding
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
do
i
take
it
that
your
position
is
whatever
rights
there
may
be
to
have
a
relationship,
for
example,
by
telephone
call,
correspondence,
there
is
absolutely
no
right
to
any
visitation,
even
noncontact,
so
that
whatever
you
permit
is
a
matter
of
administrative
grace?
is
that
your
starting
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
no
right
to
visitation,
noncontact
visitation
at
all?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
everything
that
we're
arguing
about...
you...
in
your
view
of
this
is
a
matter
of
administrative
grace?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
casey,
would
you
explain...
you
have
been
very
clear
of
what
is
your
position
about...
round
one
of
this
case
in
the
lower
courts,
when
you
clarified
that
your
regulations
went
only
to
contact
visits
and
then
you
came
around
and
said
it
applies
to
all
visits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
the
district
court
the
first
time
around
the
district
court
didn't
think
it
was
limited
to
contact?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
district
court
understood
that
it
was
dismissing
the
complaint
with
respect
to
any
visitation,
contact
and
noncontact,
or
we
just
don't
know?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
relation
to
the
family,
this
one
last
question,
a
child
must
be
accompanied
by
an
adult
and
you
cut
that
back
from
any
adult
on
the
filing
of
the
affidavit
to
only
an
immediate
family
member.
does
an
immediate
family
member
include
an
unwed
father?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
an
unwed
father
would
not
be
a
spouse?
this
is
the
child...
the
mother
is
incarcerated,
the
child
is
brought
to
visit
her.
can
the
person
who
brings
the
child
be
that
child's
biological
father,
maybe
even
care-giving
father?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
unwed
father
would
be
a
member
of
the
child's
immediate
family.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
although
not
of
the
mother's
immediate
family?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
mother
is
in
prison?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
unwed
father
would
not
qualify?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
lamken,
you
are
then
agreeing
with
mr.
casey
that
there
is
right
of...
no
right
to
any
visitation,
contact,
noncontact,
that
what
right...
what
privilege
is
extended
is
a
matter
of
administrative
grace?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
there
is
a
right
to
communicate
to
that
extent,
or
you've
been
candid
and
upfront
and
said
there's
no
right
to
visitation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
extend
that
as
well
to
telephone
calls
and
writing
letters?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there's
nothing
in
the
district...
in
the
district
court's
opinion
or
order
that
clarifies
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
their
position
is
they
have
the
right
to
say
no
to
all
children?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
their
position
is
not
different
with
respect
to
a
child,
a
grandchild,
a
sibling.
they
say
whatever
we
want
to
do,
it's
up
to
us
to
do
in
our
judgment
and
you
have
no
right
at
all,
whatever
you
get
is
a
privilege.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
where
we
have...
mr.
lamken
clarified
that...
that
there
is
a
right
of
expression,
and
that's
why
he
said
you
couldn't
cut
off
letters.
but
he
maintains
that
there
is
not
this
right
of
intimate
association,
that
the
right
doesn't
exist
at
all.
so
you
never
get
into
turner
v.
safley
balancing.
and
i
think
your
first
job
is
to
establish
that...
that
just
as
a
prisoner
retains
a
right
of
expression,
which
can
be
curtailed
drastically
given
incarceration,
just
as
there
is
that
interest
and
expression,
so
there
is
a
retained
interest
in
intimate
association,
which
can
be
shrunk,
but
not
totally
eliminated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
relationship
that
counts
is
the
relationship
to
the
prisoner,
not
to
the
child?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
unwed
parent
would
not
be
related
to
the
prisoner,
but
you
have
on
that
list,
let's
assume
we're
past
the
basic
question
and
there
is
some
constitutional
right,
you
have
on
the
list
a
person
whose
parental
rights
have
been
terminated,
and
you
would
allow
that
person
a
right
that
doesn't
exist
outside
the
prison,
in
other
words,
once
a
parental
relationship
has
been
terminated,
there
is
no
visitation
right,
according
in
the
larger
society,
but
you
would
say
that
it's
arbitrary
in
the
prison
setting
to
deny
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
it's
no
right
of
yours,
if...
if
you...
if
the
legal
parent
wants
to
allow
someone
with
no
parental
rights,
but
you've...
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
as
far
as
any
right
is
concerned,
a
person
who
has...
whose
parental
rights
have
been
terminated
is
a
stranger
to
the
child.
and
it's
one
thing
to
talk
about
what
would
be
reasonable
for
a
prison
to
do.
but
i
don't
know
how
you
get
any
right
with
respect
to
someone
who
has
no
right
outside
the
prison?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
you...
but
if
you
spread
to
other
prisoners,
then
you're
going
beyond
the
constitutional
right
that
you've
identified
as
intimate
association.
i
understand
that
for
family.
but
just
a
friend
who
is
an
ex-prisoner.
how
does
that
come
with
intimate
association?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
do
i
understand
your
position
that
you
don't
get
to
any
turner
against
safley
question,
because
there's
simply
no
right
to
beginning
with,
no
right
that
can
be
shown?
