justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
got
the
impression
that
the
state
had
represented
that
they...
that
they
covered
only
contact
visitation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
court
thought
it
only
applied
to
contact
visitation--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
the
rules
as
i
understand
are
at
page
174
of
the
appendix
of
the
cert
petition
and
they
don't
tell
us
anything,
at
least
i
couldn't
find
anything,
about
the
number
of
visits
a
person
can
have
or
how
often.
do
the
rules
regulate
that
the
number
of
times
a
particular
visitor
may
visit
an
inmate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
111
of
the
joint
appendix?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
evidence
they
found
out
how
many
nephews
and
nieces
would
be
excluded
by
the
rules
and,
therefore,
worked
that
into
the
quantity
determination,
that's
a
strange
way
to
regulate
quantity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
would
you
distinguish
the
holding
in
turner
against
safley
pertaining
to
the
right
to
marry?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
agree
that
the
inmate
could
be...
have
a
visit
from
his
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
high-security
prisons
that
don't
have
noncontact
facilities?
i
know
there's
some--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--low
security.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
shouldn't
we
decide
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
we're
dealing
with
facilities
that
can
have
noncontact
visits?
