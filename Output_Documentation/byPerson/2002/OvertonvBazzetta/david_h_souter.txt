justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
understand
it,
the
regs
originally
would
have
prohibited
visits
from
minor
siblings
of
the
prisoner
and
that
has
been
changed
by
statute;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
on
the
class
of
visitor
eligibility
then,
what
were
i
going
about
is
nieces
and
nephew,
minor
nieces
and
nephews?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
state's
interests
in...
in
restricting
visits
from
minor
nieces
and
nephews
of
the
prisoner?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
simply
a
means
of
reducing
volume?
there's
nothing
peculiar
to
the
niece/nephew
relationship?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
just
want
to
keep
the
numbers
down
and
this
is
one
way
to
do
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
labelle,
are
you
asking
them
to
exercise
their
expertise
on
a
subcategory
of
children
basis?
or
are
you
saying
as...
is
your
real
point
something
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
that
once
they
make
a
decision
to
allow
child
visitation,
they've
got
to
restrict
it?
if
they
restrict
it
at
all
on
what
you
call...
i
think
you
called
a
content-neutral
basis.
and
i
believe
you
meant
by
that
they
can
put
a
number
on
it,
only
x
number
of
children
in
y
period
of
time
or
something
like
that,
but
they
cannot...
i
thought
you
were
saying...
determine
subcategories
of
children
who
will
be
privileged
and
others
that
will
not
be.
that
would
be
one
answer
to
justice
breyer
and
one
answer
i
guess
to
the
problem
that
we've
all
got
about
how
are
we
going
to
manage
this
litigation
if...
if
we've
got
to
do
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
is...
is
your
basic
position
the
so-called
content-neutral
position?
all
you
can
regulate
is
number
once
you
allow
any
in?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
you
would
say
the
burden
would
be
on
the...
on
the
prison
to
say
despite
the
number
regulation,
this
one
can't
get
in
as
opposed
to
the
burden
on
the
prisoner
saying
despite
your
regulation,
an
exception
ought
to
be
made
for
me?
you're
switching
the
burden?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
cut
you
off.
finish
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--how
do
you
square
your
argument
on
content-neutral
with
respect
to
child
visitation?
with
other
visitation
that
might
be
an
issue,
for
example,
one
of
the
things
that's
an
issue
here
is
the
possible
visitation
of
other
prisoners.
would
you
say
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
once
the
prison
allows
any
adult
visitation,
the
only
limitation
it
can
place
as
a
general
matter
is
numbers,
and,
therefore,
the
prison
would
have
to
object
on
a
specific
basis
with
the
burden
to
establish
on
a
specific
basis
that
the
visitation
of
any
prior
prisoner
would
be
deleterious?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
just
as
a
threshold
question,
are
you
going
to
apply
your...
your
content
neutral-theory
across
the
board
to
adults,
as
well
as
children?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
would
be
the
burden
of
the
prison
to
show
that
in
a
given
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
you
were
saying
the
only
categorical
restriction
you
can
make
is
visitors,
nonvisitors.
when
you
say
you
can
have
visitors,
the
only
further
restriction
is
one
of
numbers
given
at
least
this
prison's
rationale?
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
if
you're
going
to
accept
that
kind
of
categorization
as
legitimate,
what's
your
basis
for
saying
that
in
the
case
of
child
visitation,
it's
got
to
be
content-neutral?
justice
david
h.
souter
or
are
you
merely
quantifying?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're...
so
you're
saying,
look
we
will
take
their
rationale
at
their
word,
and
if
we
take
it,
this
is
the
only
limitation
that
they
could
put
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
