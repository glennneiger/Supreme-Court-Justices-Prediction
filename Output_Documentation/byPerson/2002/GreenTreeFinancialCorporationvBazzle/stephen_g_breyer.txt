justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
true.
that's
true,
but
what's
bothering
me
is
exactly
this
point.
i
can
understand
your
argument
to
this
point.
a
state,
i
don't
think
could
possibly,
consistent
with
section
2,
interpret
the
word
arbitration
in
a
contract
to
contain
all
the
bells
and
whistles
of
a
court
proceeding,
because
that
would
transform
the
arbitration
into
a
court
proceeding,
and
therefore
they
would
have,
in
this
subtle
way,
not
only
have
shown
hostility
to
but
destroyed
the
arbitration
contract,
but
what
about
this
one.
is
this
hostile
to
arbitration?
i
have
no
doubt
that
green
tree
wouldn't
have
agreed,
in
all
likelihood,
had
they
known
what
was
going
to
happen,
and
to
that
extent
it
is
hostile
to
arbitration,
but
the
consumers
on
the
other
side
might
have
said,
oh,
we
rather
like
it,
in
which
case
from
their
point
of
view
it
isn't
hostile
to
arbitration,
so
sort
of
from
one
side
it
is,
and
from
the
other
side
it
isn't,
and
how
do
we
decide
whether,
overall,
it
is
or
it
isn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
what
we
don't
know
here
is
whether
there
is
or
there
isn't.
we
have
silence,
and
like
many
that
are
silent,
you
have
to
impute
an
intent,
and
what
south
carolina
did
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is,
they
imputed
an
intent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
did
it
by
a
rule
that
says
that
since
the
other
parties
in
our
minds
would
have
jumped
for
joy,
and
you,
your
client
would
have
weeped
in
dismay,
we
in
that
situation
interpret
the
contract
against
the
drafter,
which
happened
to
be
your
client,
so
they
chose
the
other
side
and
thereby
concluded
that
it
was
not
hostile
to
arbitration,
though
it
wasn't
in
the
interest
of
one
of
the
parties.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you...
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
obvious
solution
to
that
would
be
to
read
into
their
contract
the
idea
that
they
had
agreed
to
that
situation
provided
they're
fairly
represented,
et
cetera,
and
if
they
don't
like
the
result,
they
can
arbitrate
that,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
leaves
this
open,
and
i
mean,
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is...
whether
you
did...
whether
this
or
is
not
the
proper
interpretation
of
what
the
parties
intended
is
certainly
disputable,
and
if
it's
disputable,
why
shouldn't
the
arbitrator
decide
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well...
well,
wait.
you...
i'm
going
to
hear
in
about
10
minutes
or
so
a
pretty
good
argument
the
other
side,
too--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
that
my
question
is,
where
you
have
a
contract
that
says,
interpretations
of
the
contractor
should
be
arbitrated,
and
where,
in
fact,
what
we're
arguing
about
today
is
how
one
part
of
the
contract
should
be
interpreted,
how
did
we
get
here?
why
wasn't
that
referred
to
the
arbitrator?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
but
wait.
there
is
a
case,
including
one
i
just
wrote,
i
think,
for
the
court
which
makes
very
clear
that
what
you
send
to
the
arbitrator...
i
mean,
there
are
dozens
of
cases
where
you
have
a
phrase
in
a
contract,
and
that's
in
dispute,
and
the
parties
have
agreed
we
send
disputes
about
the
meaning
of
the
contract
to
arbitration,
you
send
that
to
the
arbitrator.
i
mean,
the
only
things
that
you
don't
are
whether
there's
the
arbitration
contract
is
itself
valid,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
is
there
any...
is
there
any--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
any
case
you
could
cite...
i
mean,
i
read
most
of
them
when
i...
when
i
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
howsam
case.
i
don't
think
you
can
think
of
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
are
we
talking
about
that
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
the
meaning
of
when
you
say
it's
a
jurisdictional
issue,
when
you
agree
to
somebody
else's
statement
it's
a
jurisdictional
issue.
what
i
have
in
front
of
me
is
a
contract.
it
says,
in
this
phrase,
disputes
will
be
arbitrated,
there
is
a
question,
what
does
that
mean,
that
word
arbitration
in
this
contract,
and
then
i
know
that
the
parties
have
agreed
to
arbitrate
the
meaning
of
the
dispute,
all
right...
of
any
phrase--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--including
that
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
how
did
we
suddenly
get
into
court,
was
my
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
well,
why
isn't
this
hostile?
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
wait,
let
me
give
you
an
example.
you
would
agree
that
the
state
couldn't
interpret
silence
as
follows.
the
word
arbitration
in
this
contract,
since
it's
silent,
means
that
the
arbitration
will
take
place
at
the
bottom
of
a
coal
mine
with
no
air,
okay.
we
agree,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
what
the
other
side
has
said
is,
you
know,
in
respect
to
one
of
the
parties,
this
is
the
same
thing.
of
course
my
client
would
never
have
agreed
to
arbitration
if
he
knew
that
a
class
action
lawyer
could
find
a
provision
in
the
contract
that
nobody
thinks
really
hurt
them
but,
in
fact,
we
didn't
live
up
to,
and
then
obtain
$10
million
in
a
judgment
before
an
arbitrator,
of
which
he
gets
three
and
the
rest
is
distributed.
now,
look,
that's
what
we
were
trying
to
get
away
from.
that's
why
we
went
to
arbitration
and
not
the
court.
of
course
we
wouldn't
agree
to
such
a
thing,
and
of
course
reading
such
a
thing
into
the
silence
is
the
same
as
putting
us
at
the
bottom
of
that
coal
mine,
or
at
least
close
enough
so
you
cannot
say
that
it
is
neutral
as
to
whether
or
not
arbitration
is
good
or
bad
or
likely
to
occur,
or
volt
was
neutral
or
pro-arbitration.
this
state
rule
is
not
neutral,
it
is
hostile
to
it.
now,
that's
basically
their
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
and
i'd
like
to
hear
the
reply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
they...
could
they
then
have
a
state
law
that
says,
and
the
party
that
invokes
the
arbitration
in
the
contract
will
receive
from
the
other
party
a
bonus
of
about
$100,000
for
having
done
a
good
thing?
see,
that's
equally
ridiculous
as
to
my
example
in
the
coal
mine,
and
all
i've
done
is
make
sure
that
the
arbitration...
it's
not...
it's
not...
you
see,
it
satisfies
your
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
love
arbitration.
oh,
but
forget
my
ridiculous
example.
go
ahead
with
your...
with
your...
with
your
explanation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
i've
got
that.
then
do
you
think...
the
other
question
that's
bothering
me...
that
was
one,
and
there's
one
other,
is
that
we
have
the
words
in
the
contract
here,
and
the
words
are,
the
dispute,
any
claim,
including
what
the
contract
means,
or
the
validity
of
the
arbitration
clause,
et
cetera,
shall
be
resolved
by
binding
arbitration,
by
one
arbitrator,
selected
by
us,
with
consent
of
you,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
phrase.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
there
obviously
is
a
disagreement
as
to
the
meaning
of
that
phrase.
well,
why
shouldn't
that
be
arbitrated?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
what
we
should
do
in
this
case
is
say,
forget
what
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
says--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
south
carolina,
sorry.
i
got
it
right
the
first
time...
south
carolina
supreme
court.
forget
what
they
say.
the
question
is,
what
did
the
parties
mean,
and
therefore
send
it
back
to
the
arbitrator
for
that
determination,
not
influenced
by
the
south
carolina
opinion
in
front
of
us.
now,
is
that
the
correct
resolution,
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
the
first
case
was
a
case
where
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
bazzle
or
one
of
them
was...
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
said
what
it
meant,
not
the
arbitrator.
the
second
case,
which
was
in
front
of
the
arbitrator,
was
the
arbitrator
being
influenced
by
what
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
had
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
it's
the
other,
it's
lackey
the
supreme
court--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
instruction,
but...
but
was
he
not
guided
or
influenced
in
some
way
by
the
supreme
court
decision?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sure
they
did,
so...
but
my
impression
is
they
appointed
in
bazzle,
the
district
court
appointed
a
class,
or
certified
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
it
was
after
that
that
they
go
to
the
arbitrator
in
lackey,
and
now
what
they're
telling
us
is,
the
arbitrator
in
lackey,
knowing
that
the
district
court
had
appointed
the
class
in
bazzle,
then
appointed
the
class
in
lackey,
and
what
they
say,
i
take
it,
is
well,
that's
not
independent,
he
just
thought
that's
what
he's
supposed
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait,
wait--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
it
says
the
terms
have
to
be...
i
mean,
it
doesn't...
it
says
in
the
statute
you
have
to
enforce
the
arbitration
that
they
wrote,
and
here...
now,
it
is...
this
point
is
bothering
me,
because
i'm
not
sure
what
your
answer
to
this
was.
i
do
see
the
phrase,
shall
be
resolved
by
binding
arbitration,
by
one
arbitrator
selected
by
us,
with
consent
of
you.
now,
the
opt-out
can
be,
consent
of
you.
i
get
that.
if
they
don't
opt
out,
they
consent,
but
what
about
the
phrase,
by
one
arbitrator
selected
by
us?
we've
come
around,
we've
been
talking
about
that
nonstop,
but
i...
i
don't
have
a
clear
answer
to
that,
because
what
seems
absolutely
clear
in
the
case
of
justice
scalia
and
me,
and
he's
never
been
in
this
courtroom,
or
in
the
arbitrator
room
or
anywhere,
you
know,
i
didn't
select
that
arbitrator.
i
selected
you
for
a
different
case.
now...
now,
how
do
we...
how
do
we
square
that
with
the
words,
an
arbitrator
selected
by
me,
if
i'm
green
tree?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
they
said
right
at
that
point
we
don't
want
this
as
a
class
action,
then
they
win?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
i
see,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
risk
that
if
we
just
did
what
you
said,
they
write
in
no
class
actions,
a
court
says
this
is
a
contract
of
adhesion,
and
that
provision's
oppressive,
and
so
we
strike
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
shall
be
announcing
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
this
case
and
an
opinion
in
which
i
am
joined
by
justice
scalia,
justice
souter,
and
justice
ginsburg.
the
case
is
about
arbitration
clauses
in
contracts
that
green
tree,
which
is
a
commercial
lender
made
with
many
of
its
customers.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
held
two
things:
first,
it
held
that
the
contracts
were
silent
on
the
question
of
whether
the
parties
had
agreed
that
arbitration
could
take
the
form
of
class
arbitration
rather
like
a
class
action
where
the
named
customer
brings
a
suit
representing
a
host
of
others.
then
it
held
that
in
no
circumstances
were
the
contracts
are
silent.
the
arbitration
can
proceed
as
class
arbitration.
we
granted
certiorari
to
determine
whether
the
state
court's
decision
is
consistent
with
the
federal
arbitration
act.
now,
four
of
us,
anyway
got
stuck
at
the
threshhold.
we
thought
that
the
questions,
whether
the
contracts
are
silent
about
class
arbitration
or
whether
instead
as
green
tree
said,
they
forbid
it,
is
a
threshhold
question,
and
we
think
that
was
not
really
a
question
for
the
court,
that
was
a
question
for
the
arbitrator.
so,
we
conclude
that
on
that
question,
the
arbitrator
should
have
decided
it
independently
but
he
did
not.
so,
we
remand
the
case
so
that
he
can.
now,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
the
south
carolina
is
therefore
vacated,
and
it
is
remanded
after
further
proceedings.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
dissenting
in
part.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
o'connor
and
justice
kennedy
joined
and
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
