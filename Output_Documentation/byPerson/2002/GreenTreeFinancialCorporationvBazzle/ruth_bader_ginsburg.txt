yes.
yes,
one
might
doubt
it
if
their
claim
was
worth
$2,
and
it
would
cost
them
more
to
go
into
court
to
make
the
objection.
the...
the
class
action
vehicle
in
some
cases
will
make
an
action
possible
that
wouldn't
be
brought
before
an
arbitrator
before.
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips,
first,
you're
not...
you're
not
urging
that
there's
any
inherent
inconsistency
between
the
arbitration
and
class
action.
you
concede
in
your
brief,
i
think,
that
if
the
parties
agreed,
yes,
you
could
have
a
class
action
in
arbitration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
there
been
no
class
actions
in...
in
arbitration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
there
been
no
class
actions
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
aaa
have
no
rules
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--class
actions?
it's
just
silent--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
suppose--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
the
parties
had
chosen,
say,
a
new
york
forum...
i
thought
an
arbitration
agreement
is
supposed
to
be
a
forum
for
action
laws.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
they
said
nothing
about
class
action
and
they
chose
new
york
as
a
forum,
new
york
has
a
class
action
vehicle.
they
could
get...
the
plaintiffs
could
get
a
class
action,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it...
it...
then
arbitration
is
something
other
than
a
mere
choice
of
forum,
because--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
did
select
the
arbitrator.
it
was
your
arbitrator.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
should--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
you're
concerned
about
the
third
parties,
how
does
it
differ
from
a
court-declared
class
action
where
the
safeguards
are
the
class
members
have
notice,
and
there's
a
notice
here
that
is
clearer
than
most
notices,
and
if
they're...
if
they
say
that
they
were
inadequately
represented,
they
could
collateral
attack
on
that
basis.
why
should
those
states'
laws
be
any
different
in
an
arbitral
forum
than
in
a
court
forum?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
court
can't
do
it
as
it...
the
federal
rules
have
a
class
action
provision--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
federal
rules
can't
affect
substantive
rights,
only
procedure,
so
the
class
action
device,
classes
are
certified
every
day
in...
in
federal
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
they're
not
changing
the
substance
of
any
contract
that
they're
declaring
in
a
contract
setting,
a
class
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
said
there's
a...
there's
a
silence
in
this
contract
and
we're
going
to
construe
it
against
the
drafter.
you
concede
that
you
could
have
arbitration
in
a
class
format,
and
so
that
south
carolina
said
it
doesn't...
this
contract
doesn't
say
one
way
or
the
other
and
we'll
construe
it
against
the
drafter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
history,
ms.
pillard,
of
this
in
south
carolina,
or
is
this
the
first
time?
have
there
been
class
proceedings
before
arbitrators
in
the
past?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
a...
suppose
the
state
law
said,
not
only
do
we
interpret
silence
to
mean
you
can
have
it
in
a
class
format,
but
that
if
any
arbitration
clause...
any
arbitration
contract
excludes
class
action
we
will
hold
that
against
our
public
policy
and
unenforceable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the...
the
supreme
court
would
explain,
we
love
arbitration,
that's
why
we're
not
going
to
let
anybody
make
it
a
smaller
arbitration,
so
that's...
so
we're
not
being
hostile
to
arbitration.
