mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first
in
volt
and
then
again
last
term
in
waffle
house
this
court
made
clear
that,
quote,
arbitration
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
a
matter
of
consent,
not
coercion.
it
is
that
core
federal
principle
that
was
violated
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
to
be
sure,
justice
o'connor,
but
this
contract
was
not
interpreted
in
accordance
with
the
understanding
of
the
parties,
with...
with
respect
to
the
parties.
ultimately,
you
have
to
look
for
the
parties'
consent
to
this
kind
of
an
agreement,
and
what
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
was
quite
clear
about--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
be
sure,
there
was
no
express
provision
to
that
effect,
but
if
you
look
at
the
south
carolina
supreme
court's
decision
in
this
case
what
it
says
is,
first,
the
parties
were
absolutely
silent
with
respect
to
class
arbitration.
that's
not
surprising.
i've
never
read
a
class
arbitration
clause
in
any
contract,
and
i'm
told
that
no
one's
ever
even
attempted
to
draft
a
class
arbitration
clause.
but
second
of
all,
the...
the
court
went
further
than
that
and
said
what
was
going
to
inform
its
judgment
about
how
to
interpret
or
how
to
apply
this
particular
situation,
it
wasn't
anything
with
respect
to
the
language
or
understanding
of
the
parties.
what
it
was
was,
without
any
contractual
directive
whatsoever,
staying
it
twice,
the
court
simply
coerced
green
tree
to
defend
a
class
arbitration
proceeding.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in...
the
difference
between
this
case
and
volt,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
there
the
parties
agreed
that
the
arbitration
itself
would
be
controlled
solely
by
california
law.
that
was
the
consent
of
the
parties.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
and
that
was
understood
by
this
court,
and
by
the
lower
courts
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
to
embrace
california
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the...
the
underlying
contract
is
governed
by
south
carolina
law,
but
the
arbitration
provision
itself
is
governed
exclusively
by
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
ways
you
can
get
to
this
question.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
effort
by
south
carolina
supreme
court
to
apply
south
carolina
law.
what
they
did...
they're
not
looking
for
the
consent
of
the
parties.
they're
looking
to
coerce
a
result
based
on
their
view
of
efficiency
and
equity
which
involves
the
interests
of
completely
third
parties
to
this...
to
this
situation,
not
the
parties
to
this
particular
agreement.
if--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if,
in
fact,
south
carolina
had
purported...
if
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
had
purported
to
try
to
interpret
this
agreement
as
in
some
sense
reflecting
a...
a
consent
by
the
parties
to
a
class-based
arbitration
it
would
be
a
much,
much
closer
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
not
the
standard
that
the
court
applied
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
that's
not
bad
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
difference
between
that,
of
course,
is
that
is
what
you
expect
when
you...
when
you
consent
to
a
bilateral
arbitration
arrangement.
when
you
say,
we're
going
to
proceed
to
resolve
this
dispute
in
an
efficient
and
economical
fashion,
you
understand
that
that
means
arbitration,
however
the...
however
that
gets
played
out
and,
indeed,
generally
speaking,
you
would
expect
that
to
be
a
question
for
the
arbitrator,
more
than
you
might
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
difference
here,
of
course,
is
we're
talking
about
making
a
decision
that's
binding,
or
at
least
purports
to
be
binding
on
literally
thousands
of
other
individuals
who
are
not
parties
to
this
agreement,
and
this
goes--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
we
don't
know
whether
they
objected
or
not.
all
we
know
is
that
they
received
notice
and
took
no
action
as
a
consequence
of
it,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
you...
if
you
flip
this
case
around,
in
this
situation,
where
the...
where
the
unnamed
members
potentially
are
going
to
receive
$5,000
to
$7,500
of
windfall
recoveries,
my
guess
is
they're
not
going
to
object,
but
what
if
the
case
had
gone
the
other
way.
what
if
the
arbitrator
had
issued
a
$1
nominal
damage
award
for
each
member
of
this
class.
does
anyone
seriously
doubt
that
the
next
day
any
of
those
unnamed
class
members
could
show
up
and
say,
excuse
me,
i
have
a
right
under
my
contract
to
choose
my
arbitrator
in
an
agreement
between
myself--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--can
i...
can
i
respond
to
that,
justice
ginsburg,
because
you
see,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
simply
reflects
the
manifest
hostility
to
the
arbitration
agreement
as
it's
been...
as
it's
been
written
by
the
parties
here.
i
mean,
basically
what
we're
talking
about
is,
we
have
a
dispute.
it
involves
what
will
largely
be
a
few
thousand
dollars,
potentially.
i
mean,
the
entire
contract
here
involved
$15,000
of...
in
one
case
and
$7,500.
you
expect
the
disputes
are
going
to
be
relatively
small,
and
you
expect
that
the
parties
are
going
to
choose
an
efficient
method
of
trying
to
resolve
those
cases
and
move
on,
and...
and
they
waive
their
right
to
a
public,
or
judicial
review,
because
the
theory
is,
win
or
lose,
it's
worth
taking
the
risk.
when
you
take
that
kind
of
a
situation
and
you
convert
it
into
a
$27
million
fine,
nobody
would
agree
to
that
ab
initio.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
seems
to
me
that
the
linchpin
theory
of
the
case
ought
to
be
the...
the
point
i
started
with,
justice
breyer,
which
is,
you
look
to
determine
whether
there
is
the
consent
of
the
parties
or
whether--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
what
south
carolina
did--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--they
imputed
an
intent.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
also
doesn't
reflect
the
consent
of
both
of
the
parties.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
both
parties
have
to
consent,
justice
breyer.
that's
the
nature
of
consent.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
simply
can't
have
unilateral
consent.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--south
carolina
supreme
court
drew
that
line.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
specifically
held
that
the
parties
agreed
that
the
arbitration
clause
would
be
governed
exclusively
by
the
federal
arbitration
act,
and
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there
are
two
ways
to
get
there.
first
of
all,
as
a
matter
of
just
south
carolina
law
we
know
that
south
carolina's
arbitration
provisions
completely
go
by
the
wayside
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
munoz
held
that
several
years
ago.
if
the
faa
applies,
there
is
no
state
law
that
is
residual
to
it.
it
is
determined
by
the
federal
arbitration
act,
which
means
that
the
arbitrator
is
going
to
make
certain
kinds
of
decisions.
but
the...
i
think
the
key
line
here
is
that
arbitrators
are
absolutely
free
to
fashion
whatever
rules
they
think
are
appropriate
for
resolving
disputes
in
a
bilateral
situation.
the
question
is,
where
does
the
arbitrator
get
the
authority
to
reach
out
to
literally
thousands
of
other
parties
in
order
to
resolve
their
rights?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
although,
justice
ginsburg,
there
is
not
a
single
example
that
i
could
identify
of
any
parties
ever
agreeing
to
go
into
a
class
action
through
arbitration.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
other
than
this
one?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
are
in
california,
but
that's...
that's
it.
california
and
south
carolina
are
the
only
places,
and
the
reason
is,
is
that
what
you
create
is
this
extraordinarily
hideous
hybrid
kind
of
a
proceeding.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
as
far
as
i
know.
i
mean,
they
didn't
file
a
brief
in
this
case,
but
as
far
as
i
know
aaa
doesn't
have
rules
specifically
dealing
with
it.
they
find
it
to
be,
as
i
understand
it,
quite
burdensome
to
try
to
figure
out
how
to
deal
with
it.
if
you
think
about
it,
this...
you're...
you're
taking
a
dispute
that
by
its
nature
is
supposed
to
involve
a
few
thousand
dollars,
converting
it
into
$27
million.
the
costs
in
this
case
alone--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--were
$36,000.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that's
part
of
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
the
difficulty
with
that
is
that
there's...
there's
no
state
law
in
general...
i
mean,
there
are
no
statutes
out
there
that
provide
for
class
actions
with
respect
to
arbitrations.
that's
why
this
is
a
hostile--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--oh,
absolutely.
the
federal
arbitration
act
creates
a
substantive
law
of
arbitrability.
to
be
sure,
it
incorporates
and
embraces
decisionmaking
by
the
arbitrator.
it
recognizes
some
limited
role
in
some
circumstances
for
state
law,
although
again
south
carolina
doesn't
do
that,
but
there...
there
is
nothing
that
provides
a
mechanism
for
converting
your
ordinary
bilateral--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i...
i
think
if
the
parties
all
agreed
to
have
it
resolved
by
the
same
arbitrator--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
i
think
in
that
situation
what
you're
then
doing
is
depriving
us
of
our
right
under
those
agreements
to
choose
our
own
arbitrator.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--this
in
a
vengeance,
i
will
say,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i...
i
have
a
substantial...
substantially
less
of
an
objection
to
that
kind
of
a
procedure
because
it
doesn't
adjudicate
unnamed
parties'
rights,
or
purport
to
adjudicate
those
rights.
at
least
you
have
a
real
dispute
that
already
exists--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--which
can
justify
in
some
sense
consolidation.
i
still
think
you
have
to
respect
green
tree's
right--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
because
the...
the
arbitration
process
requires
the
filing
of
claims
and
going
through
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
we
don't
know
whether
there
is,
in
fact,
a
dispute
between
the
parties
in
the
absence
of
some
effort
by
the
plaintiffs
to
come
forward.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but...
but
it...
just
because
you
may
have
a
right
doesn't
mean
you
necessarily
care
to
assert
your
right.
again,
it's...
it's
easy
to
look
at
this
case
and
say,
well,
gee,
there's
an
opportunity
to
pick
up
$5,000
in
windfall,
or
$7,500
in
windfall,
but
you
know,
an
arbitrator
could
just
as
easily
have
rendered
a
decision
here
that
said,
this
is
a
pure
technicality,
it's
entitled
to
$1
in
nominal
damages,
and
the
class-wide
relief
ought
to
be
$1,900,
and
attorney's
fees
ought
to
be
a
third
of
that,
which
is
$600--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
i
guarantee
you
they
would
not
be
willing
or
prepared
to...
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
would
not
be
prepared
to
abide
by
that.
every
one
of
the
unnamed
members
would
say,
i
never
had
an
opportunity
to...
to
participate
in
the
selection
of
the
arbitrator
who
has
resolved
my
substantial
rights.
there's
no
basis
at
all
to
bind
me
under
these
circumstances,
and
i'm
going
to
show
up
and
make
a
claim.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
see,
justice
breyer,
we...
we
keep
making
up
more
and
more
and
more,
and
none
of
this
is...
is
at
all
linked
to
any
kind
of
consent
among
any
of
these
parties.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
do
not
consent
to
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
raised
that
as--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--as
early
and
often--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
and
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
specifically
addressed
the
question
of
waiver
and
found
that
we
never
waived
our
right
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
was
our
arbitrator
with
respect
to
the
dispute
with
the
bazzles
and
the
lackeys
and
the
buggses,
to
be
sure,
but
we
did
not
agree
to
an
arbitrator
to
resolve
any
disputes
involving
unnamed
third
parties--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--see,
i
don't
think
it
is
disputed
what
the
parties...
what
the
parties
intended,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
except
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
the
question
of
whether
the
arbitrator
has
the
authority
to
resolve
the
rights
of
unnamed
third
parties
is
not
a
question
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide.
that's
a
question
for
the
court
to
decide.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
it
goes--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
goes
to
the
core
of
the
arbitrator's
jurisdiction
and
authority
to
decide.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
breyer,
i
think
on
the
question
of
whether
the
arbitrator
has
jurisdiction--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
authority
to
decide
the
rights
of
a
party,
that
is
a
question
for
the
court
to
decide--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--not
for
the
arbitrator.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
howsam
dealt
with
the
specific
problem
of
the
procedures
to
be
followed
with
respect
to
a
bilateral--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
we're
not
talking
about
the
procedures
to
be
followed
in
a
bilateral
agreement.
we're
talking
about
what
you
have
to
do--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
resolve
the
rights
of
third
parties
who
are
not
signatories--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that...
that's
my
point,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
anything
the
arbitrator
did
to
us--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because,
justice
breyer,
the...
the
contract
says
that...
that
it
binds
us
and
you,
and
us
and
you
are
defined
as
green
tree
and
the...
and
the
specific
named
participants
in
this
proceeding.
it
doesn't
say
word
one
about
the
rights
of
all
of
the
other
individuals
in
this--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
the
south
carolina...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
they're
not
here
complaining
today,
but
mr.
chief
justice,
you're
going
to
have
to
resolve
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
can
interpret
an
arbitration
agreement
in
a
way
that
allows
these
kinds
of
proceedings
for
the...
for
the
generality
of
cases,
and
what
do
we--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
if
you
were
going
to
allow
a
class
action
in
an
arbitral
forum
you
would
certainly
want
those...
those
protections
to
be
built
in.
my
point
is,
is
that
the
way
you
get
those
kinds
of
protections
to
exist
in
the
ordinary
class
action
is
because
the
state
coerces
the
litigation.
the
ordinary
rule
is
that
you
cannot
represent
third
parties,
and
the
court
has
identified
as
a
matter
of
its
power
situations
in
which
it's
going
to
embrace
that
approach,
but
that
doesn't
get
you
past
the
contract
problem.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the...
the
difference
there,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
here
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
the
full
authority
of
the
arbitrator
is
defined
by
the
consent
of
the
specific
parties
to
the
agreement,
and
these
parties
don't
have
the
authority
to
bind
nonparties.
the
court
said
just
last
term
in
waffle
house--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and...
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
apologize--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
the
premise
of
it,
which
is
that
the
faa
doesn't
have
anything
to
say
about
this,
but
the
core
principle
of
the
faa
is
that
there
is
supposed
to
be
consent
of
the
parties,
so
we
ought
to
be
looking
to
the
expectation
of
the
parties
to
determine
what
rights
you're
going
to
adjudicate
as
a
matter
of
arbitration.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's...
that
is
exactly
right,
justice
souter,
and
if
you
look
at
the
south
carolina
supreme
court's
opinion
it
doesn't
talk
about
anything
that
has
to
do
with
consent.
it
talks
about
equity
and
fairness
and
judicial
economy,
all
factors
that
influence
the
rights
of
third
parties
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
arbitration
agreement
that's
before
the
arbitrator.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the...
but
what
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
said
was,
we're
going
to
promote
judicial
economy
and
we're
going
to
do
it
without
a
contractual
directive
to
do
so.
to
be
sure,
the
court
said
we...
we
do
not
find
language
so
clear
here...
because
you
know,
what
they're
basically
worried
about
is,
does
this
absolutely
prohibit
the
possibility
of
class
arbitration.
is
there
language
in
there
that
says,
under
no
circumstances
will
we
ever
have
class
arbitration.
i
would
have
read
the...
this
agreement
to
have
actually
said
that,
but
they
didn't
say
that.
what
they
said
is,
well,
we
think
it's...
we
think
it's
ambiguous,
and
therefore
we'll
construe
it
against
you,
but
all
that
gets
you
to
the
point
is
that
the
contract
says
nothing
about
this,
and
the
problem
with
trying
to
square
that
with
the
faa
is
that
the
animus
for,
or
the...
the
motivation
for
acting
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
the
consent
of
the
parties,
not
simply
can
you
manipulate
the
contract
in
a
way
that
gets
you
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
has...
well,
has
consented...
yes,
has
signed
an
arbitration
agreement--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
not
with
this
arbitrator,
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
had--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
we
have
a
right
in
it,
and
it's
worth
pointing
out
we
still
have
a
right,
with
respect
to
each
one
of
those
third
party
claims,
to
have
our
choice
of
arbitrators.
we
picked
this
guy
for
these
three
or
four
claims.
as
justice
kennedy
observed,
we
went--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure.
why
not?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the...
the
point
is
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--of
a
single
arbitrator--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--with
no
right
to
judicial
review--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
stevens.
the
problem
is,
why
would
we
make
a
judgment
at
the
outset
of
this
process
that
says,
we
are
going
to
enter
into
the
most
informal
decisionmaking
process
with
no
right
to
judicial
review
and
with
$27
million
at
stake.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no
one
would.
it
would
be
madness.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
kennedy,
i'm
going
to
have
to
answer
that
on...
in
the
rebuttal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'll
give
you
the
specific
citation
when
i
step
up
here.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
kennedy,
in
response
to
your
question,
i
don't
know
precisely
the
first
time
that
we
raised
this
issue,
but
i
know
that
if
you
look
at
the
record
on
decision
at
pages
152
and
again
at
1539,
in
both
bazzle
and
in
lackey,
we
say
point
blank
the
arbitrator
exceeded
his
authority
to
proceed
as
a
class
action,
and
that
neither
green
tree
nor
any
of
the
unnamed
class
members
consented
to
have
the
arbitrator
arbitrate
their
claims,
so
we
said
it
as
plainly
as
we
could
with
respect
to
the...
with
respect
to
the
notion
of
consent.
the
specific...
aside
from
that,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
said
we
didn't
waive
our
rights,
and
it's
quite
clear
that
if
we
fight
over
these
issues
in
front
of
the
arbitrator,
we
don't
waive
our
rights.
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
first
chicago.
justice
breyer,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
arbitrator
thought
he
exercised
independent
authority,
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
both
parties
in
this
case
have
taken
inconsistent
positions.
if
you
read
the
respondent's
briefs
below,
they
say
that
the
arbitrator
had
no
authority
to
go
beyond
the
class
certification
of
the
decision
that
had
already
been
made
by
the
state
court.
whether
he
did
or
not
i
say
at
the
end
of
the
day
doesn't
matter,
because
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
for
the
arbitrator,
but
if
it
is,
he
exceeded
his
authority,
because
he
clearly
doesn't
have
the
authority
under
this
contract
to
make
a
decision
with
respect
to
the
third
parties.
that
takes
us
to
the
question
justice
scalia
raised,
which
is,
you
know,
what...
what
do
you
do
with
the
fact
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
said
not
word
one
about
arbitrator
selected
by
me?
there's
nothing
that
interprets
that
language
of
this
agreement,
and
if
the
federal
arbitration
act
doesn't
have
at
least
some
component
here
to
say,
look,
the
terms
of
the
contract
cannot
be
categorically
ignored
or
disregarded
by
the
state
court,
those
are
rights
that
are
there.
we
said
as
plainly
as
we
could
we
would
not
consent
to
this,
and
the
court
rejected
it.
and
the
final
point
i
would
make
with
respect
to
hostility,
while
it
is
true
that
this
court
has
consistently
struck
down
efforts
to
be
hostile
to
arbitration,
it
has
never
said
that
that's
the
only
basis
on
which
preemption
will
arise.
preemption
in
this
context
exists
in
the
same
way
it
does
in
every
other
context,
does
it
interfere
with
the
full
achievement
of
congress'
objections.
that's
hines
v.
davidowitz,
and
the
answer
to
that
here,
and
it's
the
same
answer
that
would
arise
if
they
were
to...
if
we
had
an
agreement
that
said
class
action
has,
that
of
course
this
is
manifest
hostility
to
this
arbitration
agreement
as
written.
it's
a
bilateral
agreement,
and
all
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
had
to
say
about
that
bilateral
agreement
is,
it
would
be
judicially
inefficient
for
us
to
have
to
go
through
each
one
of
these
individually.
well,
that's
all
well
and
good,
but
that's
coercion,
that's
not
consent,
and
if
the
federal
arbitration
act
has
any
meaning,
it
means
that
you
apply
the
consent
of
the
parties
here,
and
if
you
do
that,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
to
be
overturned.
thank
you,
your
honors.
