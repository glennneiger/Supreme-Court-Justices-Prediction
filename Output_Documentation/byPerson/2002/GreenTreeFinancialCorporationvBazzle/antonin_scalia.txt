justice

scalia
--as
to
the
other
contracts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
not
as
to
yours.
yours,
you...
you
agree
to
the
arbitrator
and
whatnot,
but...
but
take...
take
somebody
else
who--
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
in
court
by
reason
of
a
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
not
in
court
by
reason
of
a
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
here,
they
are
before
the
arbitrator
only
by
reason
of
a
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
the
difficulty
that...
one...
one
thing
you
said
a
second
ago
is...
is
really
not
accurate,
i
don't
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
might
not
want
to
put
your
company's
entire
future
in
the
hands
of
one
arbitrator.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
doctrine
of
state
contract
law
led
you...
led
to
this
result,
the
doctrine
of
construe
the
instrument
against,
contra
proferentem
against
the
person
who
drafted
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
can...
can
that
produce
anything?
i
mean,
suppose
one
side
claims
the
contract
says
nothing
about
it,
but
one
side
claims,
you
should
pay
all
the
costs
of
the
arbitrator,
all
right.
is...
is
a
state
court
going
to
decide
that
question
by
simply
saying,
well,
the
contract
says
nothing
about
it,
but
to
do
it
that
way
would
be
against
the
interests
of
the
drafter,
so
yes,
it's
in
the
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
my
next
question
is
going
to
be,
what
if
the
other
side
comes
in
and
says,
you
ought
to
pay
me
$10
million,
and
the
other
side
says,
gee,
there's
nothing
in
the
contract
about
that.
[laughter]
can
the
state
court
say,
well,
it's
against
the...
it's
against
the
interests
of
the
drafter
so
it
must
be
there
in
the
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
--to...
to
pluck
out
a
right
to
a
class
action
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
is
against
the
interests
of
the
person
who
drafted
the
contract.
it's
weird.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
big
difference--
--what
are
consolidation
arbitration...
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
you
mean
when
the
same
arbitrator
has
more
than
one
case
involving
the
same
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
he's
been
selected
for
the
various
issues.
i
mean
he...
he's
been
selected
in...
in
all
of
the
various
cases.
the
parties
have
agreed
to
this
arbitrator.
they
just
haven't
agreed
to
have
them
all
decided
in
one
proceeding,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that...
that's
a
long...
that's
a
long
way
off
from
compelling
somebody
who
hasn't
agreed
to
this
arbitration.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
begs
the
question.
i
mean,
that
precisely
begs
the
question.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
what
we're
debating,
whether
they...
whether
they
agreed
to
that
or
not,
and
to
say
that
they
agreed
to
it
because
they
agreed
to
it
doesn't
get
us
very
far.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
wait,
wait.
why...
why...
what
issue
was
placed
before
him
when
they
moved
to
decertify
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
of
whether
he
would
be
in...
in
violation
of
the
order
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
pillard,
when...
when
a
class
action
is
instituted,
it
seems
to
me
it
amounts
to
an
interpretation
not
just
of...
of
these
contracts
that
were
in
front
of
this
arbitrator,
but
also
of
the
other
contracts
that
have
been
brought
into
this
arbitration,
and
what
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
is
how
any
interpretation
of
one
of
those
other
contracts
would...
would
allow
them
to
be
brought
into
this
from
the
standpoint
not
of
this
company...
this
company
at
least
selected
this
arbitrator
for
these
cases,
and
you
could
say,
well,
they
didn't
select
him
for
the
other
cases,
which
may
be
a
good
point,
but
let's
talk
about
the
customers,
the
plaintiffs.
they
didn't
select
this
arbitrator
for
any
case,
not
even...
not
even
for
their
own
case.
they
have
had
foisted
upon
them
not
some
federal
district
judge
who
has,
you
know,
the...
the
army
behind
him,
but...
but
some
arbitrator
that,
you
know...
who
knows
who,
that
they...
they
never
selected
at
all.
how
can
you
possibly
draw
them
into
this...
how
can
you
possibly
say
that
that
contract
is
reasonably
interpreted
to
allow
them
to
be
brought
into
this...
into
this
arbitration?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
deceptive.
they...
they
are
summoned
in
by
the
power
of
the
government,
not
by...
not
by
their...
their
contractual
commitment
to
be
summoned
in.
even
if
there
were
no
contract
they
could
be
made
part
of
a
class
action,
so
to
say
that
you
can
do
it
when
the
government
is
coercing
it,
and
therefore
it's
a
perfectly
reasonable
interpretation
of
a
contract,
doesn't
make
sense
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
here,
the
only
basis
for
getting...
for
getting
these
plaintiffs
into
this
court,
or
into
this
arbitral
court
is
their
voluntary
agreement,
and
their
voluntary
agreement
gave
them
the
right
to
select
an
arbitrator,
and
they
have
been
deprived
of
that
right
entirely.
justice
antonin
scalia
consolidations
aren't
class
actions.
i
mean,
those
are
quite
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your
authority
that...
that
it
has
to
be...
you...
you
seem
to...
to
be
positing
some
kind
of
a...
of
an
intent
requirement
on
the
part
of
the
state.
it
has
to
have
it
in
for
arbitration.
why
isn't
the
federal
arbitration
act
more
reasonably
interpreted
as
directed
at
those
state
laws
that...
that
are
destructive
of
arbitration,
that...
that
are...
are
hostile
not
in
the
sense
of
any...
of
any
mental
intent,
but
that
in
their
operation
make
it
difficult
for
parties
to
enter
into
arbitration
agreements,
and
if
that's
what
it
means,
a
law
that
interprets
a...
an
arbitration
agreement
fantastically,
you
know,
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
coal
mine,
or,
you
know,
you...
you
have
to
pay
so
many
million
dollars
win
or
lose,
or,
i
think,
you...
you
have
to
subject
yourself
to...
to
class
actions,
is
a
law
that
is
hostile
to
arbitration,
that
is...
it
is...
it
is
antagonistic
to
the
ability
of
parties
to
decide
between
themselves
how,
when,
and
where
and
to
what
extent
they
will
have
an
arbitrator
decide
matters
for
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
think
that
they
could
allow
a
waiver
of
judicial
review
and
disallow
a
waiver
of
class
actions?
that
would...
that
would
boggle
my
mind.
and
you
think
that
wouldn't
display
hostility?
