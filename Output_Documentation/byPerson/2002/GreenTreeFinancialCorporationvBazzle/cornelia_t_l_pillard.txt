ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
green
tree
first
protested
by
asking
the
arbitrator
to
decide
whether
the
case
could
go
forward
as
a
class.
they
did
not
object
to
his
power
to
decide,
but
they
asked
him
to
decide
and
i...
i
think
the
relevant
document
is
on
page
15
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
green
tree's
memorandum
to
the
arbitrator.
there
is
nothing
in
the
faa
that
preempts
a
state
court
or
arbitrator
from
applying
ordinary
state
contract
law,
the
doctrine
of
construction
against
the
drafter,
to
read
a
contract
to
authorize
class
arbitration.
as
a
legal
matter,
the
consent
of
the
parties
is
determined
under
state
contract
law
by
applying
the
doctrines
of
contract
law
to
resolve
ambiguities
where
they
exist.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
the--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--you
apply--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--justice
scalia,
the...
the
argument
is
that
the
arbitrator
has
the
authority
under
state
law
to
interpret
the
ambiguity
in
the
contract,
and
it's
not
weird
at
all
in
this
case,
where,
since
1979
in
south
carolina,
arbitrators
have
had
the
authority
to
consolidate
arbitrations,
and
the
leading
cases,
champ,
the
case
on
which
green
tree
relies,
episcopal
housing,
which
is
the
first
circuit
case,
the...
the
cases
that
look
at
whether
this
is
allowed,
advert
to...
i'm
sorry,
episcopal
housing
was
itself
a
consolidation
case,
but
the
cases
that
allow
class
arbitration
advert
to
the
underlying
rule
in
the
jurisdiction--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--the
same
arbitrator
can
take
different
disputes
under
arbitration
clauses
and
bring
them
together
where--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--that's
right.
they're
all...
but,
that's
one
of
the
versions--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--it...
it's
not
at
all.
first
of
all,
i
disagree
with
the
premise
of
your
question,
justice
scalia,
that
they
haven't
agreed
to
this.
where
the
contract
permits
it,
what
green
tree
and
the...
the
class
members,
absent
and
named
class
members
agreed
to
was
a
contract
with
the
potential
for
a
class
proceeding,
with
the
potential
for
a
class
proceeding.
this...
under
the
southland
cases,
since...
since
20
years
ago
cases
have
been
going
forward--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--they--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--this
is
an
faa
preemption
case,
but
the
faa
has
nothing
to
say
here.
the
act
doesn't
say
anything
about
class
arbitration,
and
the
faa
ousts
only
state
law
that
is
hostile
to
arbitration.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
it's
not
hostile--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--right.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
think,
justice
breyer,
that
misapprehends
what
we
mean
by
hostile
to
arbitration.
hostility
to
arbitration
refers
to
state
rules
that
are
suspicious
of
or
undermine
the
ability
of
an
arbitral
forum
to
resolve
a
dispute,
and
saying
that
a
case
is
going
to
proceed
on
a
class
basis
is
a
far
cry
from
saying
this
case
is
going
to
proceed
at
the
bottom
of
a
coal
mine,
where
parties'
rights
would
actually
be...
would
not
be
able
to
be
fulfilled.
that's
the
outside
edge.
this
court
has...
has
always
said,
well,
arbitration
can't
go
forward
if
the
parties
can't
get
meaningful
relief,
and...
and
i
think
your
coal
mine
case
would
be
such
a
case.
but
what
we
mean
by
hostile
to
arbitration
is
not
whether
one
or
the
other
party
to
the
arbitration
wishes
that
they,
in
the
end,
once
the
dispute
arises,
that
they
weren't
before
an
arbitrator.
no.
what
we
mean
is,
whether
state
law
reflects
a
suspicion
about
the
capacity
of
arbitration
to
resolve
a
dispute,
and
if
anybody--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--i...
i
don't
think
it
does,
because
it's...
well,
because
it's...
it's
targeted
at
the
arbitration,
and
if
the
state
had
such
a
rule
one
could
look
at,
what's
the
purpose,
what's
the
legitimate
purpose
of
that
rule--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--it
seems
the...
well,
that
is...
is
the
focus.
the
focus
has
to
be
whether
the
state
law,
not
looking
at
ex
post,
once
the
parties
are...
are
unhappy
with
the
broadly
worded
contract--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--yes.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
yes.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
exactly,
and
it
was.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
no,
justice
breyer.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
because
the
arbitrator
already
did
look
at
this
clause
and
decided
that
the...
that
the
language
of
the
arbitration
agreement
allowed
him
to
decide.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
the...
the
bazzle
case
did
not
go
up
to
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
before--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--the
cases
came
up
to
the
supreme
court
together--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--after
both
decisions
were
made,
and
as
an
initial
matter
the
bazzle
case
went
to
the
trial
court,
which
decided
as
an
initial
matter
that
the...
in
the
lackey
case
the...
the
arbitrator
made
the
decision
as
an
initial
matter,
looking
at
the
language
of
the
contract
and
determining,
without
any
prior
judicial
instruction
on
the
matter--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--green
tree
tries
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
to
dispute
that
the
arbitrator
in
lackey
made
an
independence
decision--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--that
the
contract
authorized
class
arbitration.
that
argument
is
a
complete
red
herring.
their
own
brief
to
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
repeatedly
asserted
that
in
lackey
the
arbitrator,
quote,
took
it
upon
himself
to
determine
the
propriety
of
a
class-wide
arbitration
and
certify
a
class.
that's
at
page
29
of
their
south
carolina
supreme
court
brief.
they
say
again
and
again...
their
question
presented
refers
to
the
arbitrator
deciding
the
class
action
issue
himself.
that's
question
presented
2--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--we
don't
have
either
precisely,
but
let
me
tell
you
what
i
think
is
relevant
to
that.
the
arbitrator
in
bazzle
did
also
consider
the
issue.
the
issue
was
placed
squarely
before
the
arbitrator
when
green
tree
moved
him
to
decertify
the
class
to
grant
that
green
tree
did
fight
this,
a--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--they
moved
to
decertify--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--there
was
no
order
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
at
that
time.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
there
was
only
the
order
of
the
trial
court,
which
read
the
contract
to
allow
class
arbitration.
then
it...
the
class
was
certified
and
sent
to
the
arbitrator,
and
then
the
issue
was
before
the
arbitrator
should
be
decertify
the
class,
and
green
tree
argued
that...
that
they
should.
moreover,
in
green
tree's
motion
to
vacate
the
award,
after
the
arbitrator
in
bazzle
made
the
arbitration
award,
they
characterized
the
arbitrator
as
having
made
the
decision
that
the
class
could
proceed
in
arbitration.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
certified
a
class.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
right,
and...
and
i
very
much
disagree
with
that
characterization
of
the
record,
and
i'll
try
to
help
to
make
it
clearer.
first,
as
i
pointed
out,
in
their
own
briefs
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
they
characterized
the
lackey
arbitrator
as
having
acted
independently.
there
is
no...
no
record
support
for
green
tree's
current
assertions
that
the
arbitrator
did
not
make
an
independent
decision.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
supports
it,
and
it
is
not
the
case.
the
arbitrator
said
that
he
determined
that
a
class
action
should
proceed
based
on
his
careful
review
of
the
broadly
drafted
arbitration
clause
prepared
by
green
tree.
that's--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--i'm
not
aware
that
there
are,
justice
ginsburg.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
reported
decisions
on
that.
there
have
been
class
arbitrations
in...
in
the...
one
of
the
largest
economies
in
the
world
for...
for
20
years,
and
there
have
been
a
smattering
of
class
arbitrations
in
other
places,
and
i...
i--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--i
have
two
answers
to
that,
justice
scalia.
first,
there's
no
question
that
if,
under
a
contract
that
had
a
forum
selection
clause
that
said,
any
disputes
under
this
contract
will
be
resolved
in
a
forum
chosen
by
us
with
the
consent
of
you,
and
a
plaintiff
chose
a
forum
and
filed
a
class
action
and
offered
opt-out
rights
to
every
absent
class
member
who
wanted
to
opt
out,
and
those
absent
class
members
were
bound
by
the
same
contract,
their
right
to
consent
to
the
forum
would
be
protected.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
up
to
your
last
sentence.
they
have
not
been
deprived
of
that
right.
it
is
exactly
true
that
the
authority
of
the
arbitrator
over
the
absent
class
members
derives
from
contract,
and
every
single
absent
class
member
was
a...
a
signatory
to
the...
to
the
same
arbitration
clause.
they
were
all
governed
by
the
same
clause,
and
once--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--green
tree
wrote
a
clause
that...
it
swept
everything
within
it.
they
said,
we
trust
everything
to
the
arbitrator.
this
clause
is
extremely
broad.
once
they
did
that...
they
drafted
a
clause
which
the
arbitrator
and
every
south
carolina
judge
to
look
at
it
believed
was
susceptible
of
a
reading
that
had
authorized
class
action.
in
that
case,
you
read
this
contract
as
if
it
had
provided
for
class
arbitration,
and
when
they
select--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--i
would
think
not,
no,
and
indeed,
those
people
were
excluded
in
this
case.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
because
they
have--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--because
they
have
no...
the
arbitrator
has
no
authority
over
them,
because
neither
they
nor
green
tree
consented
to
that,
but
by
hypothesis,
if
you
had
a
clause--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--oh,
i
disagree.
the
consent
was
bilateral.
green
tree
chose
an
arbitrator,
and
when
it
chose
an
arbitrator
for
a
case
under
a
contract
broad
enough
to
authorize
class
action,
legally
it
has
chosen
an
arbitrator
with
the
possibility
that
the
class
could
proceed.
indeed,
when
they
chose--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--the
arbitrator,
the
case
had
already
been
filed
as
a
class
action.
it
was...
they
were
on
notice--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--of
the
possibility
that
this
issue
would
be
litigated
on
a
class
basis.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
have
several
answers
to
that,
justice
souter.
first
of
all,
this
court
has
never
said
that
a
case
with
a
large
amount
of
money
at
stake,
indeed
in
mitsubishi
motors
with
antitrust
cases,
in
mcmahon
with
ricos...
rico
and
securities
cases,
large
amounts
of
money
at
stake,
arbitration
is
permitted.
they--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--right.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
right.
they
were...
they
were
on
notice.
if
they
had
good
lawyers
doing
this,
they
would
have
a
long
time
before
1998
put
in
the
simple
one
phrase
that
they
put
into
their
contract
as
of
1998
which
says,
nobody
who
signs
this
can
be
a
class
member
or
a
class
representative.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
yes.
i
think
in...
in
particular,
the
episcopal
housing
case
put
them
on
notice
as
of
1979
there
were
consolidations
being
permitted,
and
the
courts
who
were
looking
at
the
class
question,
the
champ
court--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
courts
that
have
decided
whether
or
not
to
authorize
class
arbitration
in
an
appropriate
case
have
looked
as
an
analogy
to
the
consolidation
precedent,
so
you
have
a
jurisdiction
in
which
there
is
consolidation
precedent,
and
parties,
when
they
agree
to
contracts
in
ambiguous
terms,
agree
to
submit
to
the
natural
evolution
of
state
law,
and
that
is...
that
does
on
occasion
present
risks.
that
does
present
risks,
but
they
chose
both
to
draft
a
clause
very
broadly
and
to
submit
everything
to
the
arbitrator.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
no,
and
i...
and
i
certainly
don't
think
that
is
a
preemption
question
for
this
court.
i
certainly
don't
think
so.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
because...
two
reasons.
one
is
that
this
was
filed
as
a
class
action,
so
when
they
selected
the
arbitrator
they
were
on
notice
that
at
least
the
plaintiffs
were
trying
to
do
this.
the
second--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--no.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
the
second
answer
is
that
the
contract
was
written
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
susceptible
of
permitting
class
arbitration,
so
when
they
select
an
arbitrator
under
this
contract,
they
take
into
account,
this
could
be
an
arbitrator
that
could
award
punitive
damages.
this
could
be
an
arbitrator
that
could
proceed
on
a
class
basis.
this
could
be
an
arbitrator
who
could
order--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--broad
discovery.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
this
could
be
an
arbitrator
who
could
do
any
of
the
things
the
contract
permits.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so,
because
the...
the
language
of
the
contract
and
the
authority
that
they
have
given
to
arbitrators
is
determined
from
the
contract
language,
not
from
the
parties'
choices
at
the
threshold
where
a
particular
dispute
has
already
arisen.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
well,
i...
i
intended
to
give...
to
give
that
answer
when
i
said
this
is
not
a
preemption
question.
it
is
not
an
faa
question.
it
is
a
state
law
question,
and
i
think
that's
exactly
right,
justice
kennedy,
the
narrow
scope
of
faa
preemption
focuses
on
whether
state
law
is
hostile
to
the
arbitration
forum,
to
the
choice
of
arbitral
forum
to
resolve
ambiguities
like
these.
there
is--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--one
would
have
to
look
at
the
reasoning
of
the
state
court
in
so
holding.
if
the
reasoning
was
hostility
to
arbitration,
trying
to
trade
it
up--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--that
is,
as
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
made
clear,
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
if
it
were
an
application
of
general
contract
principles
of
unconscionability
in
a
particular
case
with
no
suspicion
of
arbitration
as
such,
then
i
think
a
state
could
do
that
under
state
law.
if
the
state
had
a
general
law
that
applied
to
litigation
and
arbitration
against
class
action
waivers,
or
against
waivers
of
class
actions
in
adhesive
contracts
that
applied
to
both
fora,
to
the
litigation
and
to
the
arbitration,
i
think
under
that
circumstance
also
it
would
not
be
hostile
to
arbitration
for
the
state
law
to
override
the
parties'
choice--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--justice
scalia,
parties
have
an
ability
to
do
that,
and
anyone
who
wants
to
put
in
a
clause
saying,
no
class
arbitration,
is
invited
to
do
that.
this
court
has
never
interpreted
hostility
to
arbitration
that
broadly,
as
you
just
described.
what
this
court
has
said
again
and
again
is
that
the
faa
preempts
only
state
laws
that
single
out
arbitration
provisions
for
suspect
status
that
undercut
the
enforceability
of
arbitration
agreements.
here,
the
arbitration
agreement
was
enforced,
and
there
is
no
faa
rule,
contrary
to
green
tree's
contentions,
that
all
arbitration
agreements
should
be
enforced
according
to
their
written
terms
without
the
benefit
of
state
rules
for
resolving
contract
ambiguity.
rather,
as
the
court
reiterated
in
waffle
house,
absent
some
ambiguity
in
the
agreement,
it
is
the
language
of
the
contract
that
defines
the
scope
of
disputes
subject
to
arbitration.
this
court
has
repeatedly
made
clear
that
it
is
state
contract
law
that
applies,
and
it
is
state
contract
law
that
resolves
any
contract
ambiguity.
green
tree
is
seeking
a
radical
expansion
of
faa
preemption.
their
rule
would
federalize
countless
disputes
over
the
meaning
of
arbitration
clauses.
parties
to
arbitration
will
come
and
say,
we
never
intended
to...
to
permit
discovery,
protective
orders,
various
types
of
motions,
types
of
damages
and
the
like
that
would
invite
any
party
unhappy
with
the
results
of
an
arbitration,
saying
we're
getting
into
more
than
we
thought,
this
is
hostile
to
arbitration
as
we
prefer,
to
come
to
this
court
and
ask
it
to
second-guess
ordinary
state
law
interpretation
of
an
arbitration
agreement.
this
court
should
not
expand
the
scope
of
faa
preemption
in
this
case.
there's
no
warrant
for
it
here.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
it's
really
very
limited,
justice
stevens,
i
agree.
this
case
deals
with
whether
this
particular
agreement
foreclosed
class
arbitration.
green
tree
agrees
that
where
an
agreement
authorizes
it,
class
arbitration
can
be
done,
and
so
all
they're
asking
you
to
do
is
to
second-guess
the
state
court's
interpretation
applying
the
rule
of
construction
against
the
drafter,
and
i
would
very
much
dispute
their
characterization
of
what
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
did
of
applying
a...
a
rule
without
any
contractual
or
statutory
directive
to
do
so.
the
court
was
there
quoting
from
a
different
case,
and
this
case
is
a
fortiori.
clearly,
the
court
looked
and
said,
there's
no
specific
directive.
as
a
preliminary
matter,
the
court
said,
the
contract
is
silent.
then
they
looked
at
the
more
general
language
the
trial
court
had
relied
on
and
said,
there's
affirmative
authorization
here
under
the
general
language,
and
they
looked
at
green
tree's
argument
that
the
reference
to
this
contract
foreclosed
it,
and
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
said,
i
find
it
ambiguous,
and
i'm
going
to
apply
the
ordinary
rule
of--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--it
depends
on
why
they
think
it's
oppressive.
if
they
think
that
waivers
generally
in
contracts,
pre-dispute
agreements
to
waive
the
right
to
proceed
as
a
class,
whether
the
contract
is
an
arbitration
agreement
or
not
are
oppressive,
then
i
think
it
might
not
be
hostile
to
arbitration.
if
they
say,
a
waiver
of
a
class
action
in
an
arbitration
setting
is
oppressive
and
unconstitutional,
that
might
run
afoul
of
this
court's
precedence
in...
in
casarotto.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
thank
you.
