justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
your...
your
argument
that
if
the
south
carolina
court
is
unreasonable
in
interpreting
state
law,
then
it
comes
up
here?
i...
i
just
don't
understand
how
we
get
this...
this
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--please,
finish
your
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
to
ask
about
consent.
at
what
point
and
how
did
you
first
object
to
the
class
action?
did...
did
you
instruct
the
arbitrator
that
we
consented
to
your
appointment
for
individuals
a,
b,
and
c,
but
not
for
other--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we...
we
do
not
consent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
when
did
you
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
after
the
first--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
idea
of
class
action.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where...
where
is
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--where
is
it
in
the
record
that
you
first
made
your
objection
to
the
class
action,
and
do
you...
does
that
objection
say
that
we
have
not
consented
to
the
arbitration
as
to
these
other
parties?
is
that
how
your
objection
was
phrased,
and
where
can
i
find
it
in
the
record?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
in...
that
was
in
lackey.
in
bazzle,
did
the
arbitrator,
after
the,
what
i'll
call
referral
from
the
state
trial
court,
did
the
arbitrator
then
say,
as
an...
as
an
independent
matter,
i
ratify,
i
confirm,
i...
i
agree
that
the
contract
should
be
interpreted
this
way,
or
does
it...
or
did
he
just
say,
i
am
following
the
order
of
the
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
green
tree
didn't
appoint
the
arbitrator
for
that
purpose.
green
tree
appointed
the
arbitrator
for
x,
y,
and
z.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--could
the...
could
the
arbitrator
have
said,
i'm...
i'm
going
to
include
in...
in
this
class
some
people
who
don't
have
an
arbitration
contract
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
why
is
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
the...
green
tree
did
not
consent
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
hypothesis
is,
the
consent
must
be
bilateral,
and
here
it
wasn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
they
had
had
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
they
had
had
enough
foresight,
could
they
have
told
the
arbitrator,
we
are
selecting
you,
but
for
this
suit
only.
you
may
not
have
a
class
action.
we
are
not
consenting.
could
they
have
said
that
up
front?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
notice
the...
none...
none
of
your
answers
to
these
questions,
including...
you
had
several
answers
for
justice
souter.
none
of
your
answers
said,
well,
you
know,
that's
a
very
interesting
theory,
mr.
justice,
but
this
is
a
state
law
matter,
it's
not
for
you.
i...
i
haven't
heard
that.
