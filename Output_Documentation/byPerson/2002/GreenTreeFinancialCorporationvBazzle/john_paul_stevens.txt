justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i...
can
i
interrupt
with
this
question,
mr.
phillips?
supposing
you
had
the...
green
tree
had
agreements
with
a
large...
large
number
of
consumers,
and
suppose
15
of
them
filed
separate
arbitrations,
they
all
went
before
the
same
arbitrator.
could
the
arbitrator
have
entered
an
order
saying,
i
think
it
would
be
efficient
to
have
all
these
cases
tried
together,
so
i'm
going
to
enter
an
order
requiring
you
to
do
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
the...
supposing
green
tree
objects.
could
he
nevertheless
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
then...
but
you
say
your...
your
objection
would
have
been
cured
if
the
arbitrator
had
written
a
letter
to
every
plaintiff
and
gotten
an...
a
written
okay,
that
would
have
made
it
okay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
my
15-individual
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
know
there's
a
common
issue
in
all
these
cases...
i
mean,
they...
they
all
had
the
same
legal
issue
involved,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it...
but
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
everybody
in
the
class
has
consented
to
an
arbitration
with
green
tree--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
to
a
class
action
arbitration,
but
to
an
arbitration.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
with
these
arbitrators.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
they
have
consented
to
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
is
it
really
reasonable
to
assume
that
if
he
knew
he
had
a
thousand
different
arbitrations
coming
up
he'd
want
a
thousand
different
arbitrators?
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
the
same
issue
in
every
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because--
justice
john
paul
stevens
makes
some
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this,
if
you
have
another
moment:
does
this
case
have
any
future
significance,
because
isn't
it
fairly
clear
that
all
the
arbitration
agreements
in
the
future
will
prohibit
class
actions?
