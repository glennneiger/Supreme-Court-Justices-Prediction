we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
02-634,
the
green
tree
financial
corporation
versus
lynn
w.
bazzle.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
how
does
that...
how
does
differ
from
volt,
mr.
phillips?
there,
the
contract
didn't
say
anything
about
the
court
staying
the
arbitration,
and
yet
we
said
in
our
opinion
that
that
was
a
permissible
thing
for
a...
that
once
the
law
of
california
had
been
invoked,
that
was
a
permissible
thing
to
be
done.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
said
the
place
where
the
construction
was...
was
taken.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
didn't...
didn't
the...
didn't
the
agreement
here
say
it
would
be
governed
by
the
law
of
south
carolina?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
if
the
south
carolina
court
in
a
somewhat
different
case
had
said
this
arbitration
is
going
to
be
governed
by
our
state
rules
of
discovery.
the
parties
have
said
nothing
about
it,
but
they
just
say,
if
you're
going
to
be
bound
by
the
laws
of
south
carolina,
that's
what
you're
going
to
do.
is
that
bad?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
but
here...
here
the
south
carolina
arbitrator,
which
you...
you
certainly
consented
to
his
appointment,
went
ahead
and
did
pretty
much
this.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not...
not
as
sweeping--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
other
individuals--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
other
individuals
are
not
here
complaining.
i
mean,
they're
probably
glad
they
got
the
7,000
bucks--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--don't
they
wear...
wear
out
after
just
one
case,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
phillips.
ms.
pillard,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--south
carolina.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
pillard.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.

green
tree
financial
