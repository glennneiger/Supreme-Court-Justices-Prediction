david
h.
souter
well,
but
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
you...
i'm
sorry,
i
thought
you
were
done.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
who
are
not...
and
who
are
not
objecting
so
far
as
i
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
green
tree
is
the
one
who's
objecting.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
please.
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
reason,
as
i
understand
it...
the
reason,
as
i
understand
it,
you
say
there
isn't
consent
was
the
reason
you
gave
in
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice,
that,
in
fact,
they
had
agreed
to
be
bound
by
south
carolina
law
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
the
contract,
but
not
with
respect
to
the
arbitration
clause
itself,
and
my
question
is,
how
do
you
draw
that
line?
there's
nothing,
per
se,
inconsistent
between
applying
the
faa
and
applying
some
state
law.
that
has
to
be
done.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
why
do
you
draw--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
i
mean,
you
say
governed
exclusively
by
the
faa,
in
the
sense
that
the
faa
naturally
is
going
to
trump
any
inconsistency
with
state
law,
but
here,
there
isn't
a
clear
inconsistency
with
state
law,
and
the
faa
is
always
applied
with
some
state
law
in
mind.
you
have
to
have
some
procedure,
and
so
on,
and...
and
therefore
i...
i
don't
know
how
you
can
draw
this
nonporous
line
between
the
faa
and
arbitration
on
one
hand
and
state
law
on
the
other.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
difficulty...
and
i...
i...
i'm
still
having
trouble
getting
over
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
don't
consent
to
every
jot
and
tittle
of
means
by
which
the
arbitration
will
be
conducted.
they
consent
in
a
gross
kind
of
way
to
arbitration
or
nonarbitration,
and...
and
that's...
that's
what
their
consent
makes
the
difference
between,
but
they
don't
consent
to
every
consequent
detail
that
enters
into
the
actual
conduct
of
the
arbitration,
so
why
should
we
draw
the
line
where
you
want
us
to
draw
the
line
as
opposed
to
drawing
the
line
a
little
further
and
saying,
if
you
consent
to
arbitration
and
a
state
says,
not
inconsistently
with
the
faa,
arbitration
can
be
done
on
a
class
basis
if
there
are
common
issues
and
so
on?
why
should
we
draw
the
line
to
exclude
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're...
you're
saying,
this
is
so
far
from
anything
that
would
have
been
contemplated--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
a
detail
to
be
filled
in
later,
and
that's
why
you
draw
the
line--
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
but
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
were
on
notice
that
somebody
wanted
a
class
action,
but
it
seems
to
me,
number
1,
they
were
not
on
notice
that
south
carolina
law
would
provide
a...
a
class
arbitration
because,
as
you
said,
it
hadn't
occurred
before,
and
the
only
thing
that
they
definitely
consented
to
was
an
arbitrator
for
this
case,
and
in
a
situation
in
which
there
was
no
existing
state
law
that
put
them
on
notice
that
they
were
in
jeopardy
of
this
result,
they're
saying
there
are
some
things
we...
i
think
they're
saying
there
are
some
things
we...
we
agree
that
have
to
be
filled
in
later
about
the
terms
of
the
arbitration.
but
with
no
history
to
indicate
that
the
request
for
class...
or
class
treatment
would
be
granted
and
would
be
possible
under
south
carolina
law,
we
surely
did
not
consent,
we
certainly
did
not
take
the
risk
that
we
consented,
that
we
were
consenting
to
arbitration
for
all
of
these
other
people,
and
if
you
doubt
that,
mr.
phillips
says,
just
step
back
and...
and
bear
this
in
mind.
without
judicial
review,
would
we
have
rolled
the
dice
for
$27
million
on
one
arbitrator?
what
is...
what
is
your
answer
to
that,
that
it,
in
effect,
it
is
just
too
implausible
to
draw
this
conclusion
out
of
the
limited
consent
that
they
gave?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
no
question
about
it.
it's
a
question
of
what
they
plausibly
consented
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
they
had
been
in
california
they
would
have
done
that,
but
were...
were,
you
know,
were
they
on
notice
that
they
had
better
guard
against
that
jeopardy
in
south
carolina?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they're
saying
this
isn't
natural
evolution,
this
is
creationism,
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--don't...
don't
they
have
a...
don't
they
have
a
point
that
there
is
a
distinction
when
the
difference
gets
to
be
that
great?
