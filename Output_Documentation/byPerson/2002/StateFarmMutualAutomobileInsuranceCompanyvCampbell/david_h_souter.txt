justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
on
the
other
side
that
the
instances
of
conduct
involving
facts
having
nothing
to
do
with
settlement
within
policy
limits,
all
came
in,
in
effect
as
rebuttal,
as
admissible
rebuttal
evidence
in
response
to
issues
that
state
farm
raised?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
that
may
be.
i
mean,
i
think
there's
no
question
it
was
looking
at
a
national
scheme.
the
question
is
whether
our
gripe,
or
your
gripe
is
with
the
utah
supreme
court
or
with
the
case
as
it
was
tried,
and
i
take
it
your
answer
to
my
question
is,
there
was
evidence
going
to
practices
having
nothing
to
do
with
settlement
within
policy
limits
that
did
come
in
without
any
relationship
to
rebuttal
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
let's
assume
the
$100
million
had
never
happened.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
argument
as
made
is,
this
is
a
company
with
a
surplus
in,
literally
measured
in
the
billions.
you've
got
to
have
a
really
big
judgment
to
get
their
attention.
what's
your
response?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
know,
but
you're
making...
i
think
you're
making
two
arguments.
first,
you're
making
the
argument
that
you
started
with,
and
that
is,
evidence
was
improperly
admitted,
acts
in
other
states
were
improperly
considered,
acts
unlike
failure
to
settle
were
improperly
considered.
let's
assume,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
you
lose...
i
mean,
if
you
win
on
that,
i
presume
we're
not
going
to
get
to
the
point
you're
arguing
now.
let's
assume
you
lose
on
that.
you
get
to
the
point
that
you're
arguing
now
and
you
say,
okay,
4
times
the
amount
of
actual
damage
would
be
okay,
145
is
not.
what
do
we
put
in
an
opinion
to
indicate
what
is
the
proper
point
in
between
4
and
145?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
i
know
that,
and
the
question
is,
is
4
times
the
relationship
appropriate,
and
145
is
not?
and
how
about
80,
and
60,
and
20?
how
do
we
grapple
with
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
point
of
your
argument
ultimately...
you're
not
saying
this,
but
i
mean,
if
we
accept
the
way
you're
going,
are
we
really
going
down
the
road
to
saying,
look,
at
some
point
we've
got
to
leave
this
in
a
less
protean
state,
and
we've
got
to
pick
a
number,
and
is
that
our
business
to
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
tribe,
i
can't
remember...
i
assume
it's
in
the
briefs,
i
just
don't
remember,
what
was
the
instruction
to
the
jury
on
any
limits
on
their
consideration
of
the
out-of-state
evidence?
was
the
jury
told,
look,
you
can
only
punish
them
for
what
they
did
here,
this
only
goes
to
intent,
or
something
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
objection
never
eventuated
in
a
request
for
an
instruction--
justice
david
h.
souter
--or
in
instruction
addressing
specifically
that
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
limiting
instruction
did
you
ask
for?
