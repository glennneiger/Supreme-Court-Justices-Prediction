justice
antonin
scalia
and
why
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
birnbaum,
why
doesn't
it
go
to
reprehensibility
if
it
were
true
that
this
failure
to
settle
claims
that
were
quite
valid
was
simply
part
of
a
nationwide
pattern
to
pay
out
less
than
was
due,
not
just
in
this
context
but
in
every
context?
why
doesn't
that
go
to
reprehensibility?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it
would
go
to
reprehensibility,
and
it
would
go
to
the
harm
suffered
by
this
plaintiff,
if
they
introduced
evidence
of
doing
the
same
thing
to
other
plaintiffs
in
other
states,
the
same
thing
to
other
plaintiffs.
how
does
that
go
to
the
harm
to
this
plaintiff?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
possibly
say
you
cannot
introduce
evidence
from
other
states,
and
at
the
same
time
say,
unless
it's
introduced
to
show
reprehensibility.
once
you
say
you're
allowed
to
introduce
it
for
reprehensibility,
i
don't
know
why
all
of
this
doesn't
go
to
show
that
state
farm
is
more
reprehensible.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
maybe...
maybe
you
can
tell
me
how
one
defines
reprehensibility
so
that
it
only
includes
what
you
call
the
same
acts.
maybe
you
can
tell
me.
that's
what
gives
me
the
trauma,
and
you
say
not
different
acts.
what
is
different
acts?
it
has
to
be
something--
justice
antonin
scalia
--other
than
a
policyholder
who...
you
know,
who
passed
five,
six
cars
on
the
highway?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
cheating
all
policyholders
in
all
contexts,
paying
less
than
they're
entitled
to,
why
isn't
that
similar
to
what
happened
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
similar
conduct
in
bmw,
to
give
some
feel
for
what
you
mean
by
similar
conduct?
justice
antonin
scalia
selling
cars
with
scratches
on
them,
or
is
it
selling...
what
about,
you
sell
cars
with
defective,
knowingly,
with
defective
clutches?
would
that
be
similar?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would...
it
has
to
be
cars
with
scratches,
it
has
to
be
the
same
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
car
had
a
scratch.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
only
cases
that
are
relevant
are
other
cases
where
bmw
pawned
off
cars
that
had
scratches?
it
could
pawn
off
all
sorts
of
other
defects,
but
not
scratches?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
lose,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that,
you
know,
we
say
that
you
can't
take
into
account
harm
to
others,
but
you
can
take
into
account
harm
to
others
so
long
as
that
is
done
under
the
rubric
of
reprehensibility.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you've
done
the
same
thing
to
other
people,
you
can
be
punished
more.
now,
you
may
find
a
significant
difference
between
punishing
you
for
what
you
did
to
the
other
people,
and
punishing
you
more
for
what
you
did
to
this
person,
because
it
is
rendered
more
reprehensible
because
of
what
you
did
to
other
people,
but
i
don't
see
a
whole
lot
of
difference
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
no
amount
of
money
will
suffice.
maybe
we
have
to
send
them
to
jail.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
didn't
have
authority
to
send
them
to
jail
though,
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
get
this
out
of
what
provision
of
our
bill
of
rights?
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
specific,
is
it?
10
times
is
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
think
the
ratio
should...
i
mean,
we
did
say
something
in
bmw
about
ratio
between
compensatory
damages
and
punitives.
what
do
you
think
the
ratio
should
be?
no
limit,
10
to,
145...
whatever
it
takes
to
stop
them?
i
mean,
what
if
nothing
will
stop
them
but
sending
them
to
jail?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
even
in
utah,
i
thought
our
case
says
you're
punishing
them
for
the
harm
done
to
this
plaintiff.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
can
take
reprehensibility
into
account,
but
it's
for
the
harm
done
to...
well,
what
about
the
harm
done
to
all
the
other
plaintiffs
in
utah?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
shouldn't
have
said
that.
