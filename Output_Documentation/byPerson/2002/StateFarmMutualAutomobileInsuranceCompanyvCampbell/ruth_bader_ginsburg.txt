nonetheless,
if
the
jury
found
such
a
policy,
that
there
was
a
policy
as
alleged
by
the
plaintiff,
that's
not...
we
have
to
take
that
as
a
given,
don't
we,
ms.
birnbaum?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
here
you're
not
drawing
a
line...
one
of
the
lines
was
similar
conduct
and
in
the
same
state,
but
in
the
automobile,
automobiles,
we're
a
very
mobile
society,
so
i
don't
think...
well,
perhaps
you
are,
but
you
said
this
is,
we
draw
a
line
around
utah,
but
suppose
the
driver
who
was
insured
by
state
farm
was
from
california,
or
from
new
york,
where
you
get
more
than
seven
incidents
out
of
14
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
we
had
just
gotten
off
the
extraterritorial...
where
you
said
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
the
insured
was
from
california
or
from
utah.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
far
as--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
birnbaum,
i'd
like
you
to
clarify
your
position
on
what
has
been
called
extraterritoriality--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
i
thought
today
that
you
were
very
forthright
with
the
court.
you
said
no,
you're
not
going
to
make
a
distinction
whether
the
plaintiff
comes
from
california
or
new
york
rather
than
utah.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
can't
just
draw
a
line
around
the
state
of
utah
and
say,
that's
the
relevant
state.
but
you
tell
us
a
supplemental
brief
was
calling
attention
to
a
case
where
there
was
a
specific
request
to
make
that
kind
of
charge.
you
made
no
such,
state
farm
made
no
such
request
in
this
case,
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes?
where?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
instruction
number
46,
which
i
looked
for,
was
the
closest
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
talks
about
both
compensatory
and
punitive
damages,
that
you
should
base
it
on
state
farm's
conduct
in
handling
of
the
case
against
curtis
campbell.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
only.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
that's
not
even
saying
other
people
within
utah.
so
that's...
and
it's
alike
for
compensatory
and
punitive.
that
is
nothing
like
the
charge
that
said,
look
in
the
state
of
nevada.
but
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
that
you
are
saying,
you
don't
look
only
to
utah,
because
this
particular
plaintiff
happened
to
come
to
utah.
it
would
be
the
same
thing
if
the
plaintiff
came
from
california.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tribe,
maybe
fewer,
maybe
fewer
now
after
a
verdict
of
that
size,
and
isn't
that
one
of
the
problems?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that...
now
there's
an
incentive
for
lawyers
to
pursue
such
claims.
before
they
might
have
thought
them
too
small
to
be
worthwhile.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
that
true
in
new
york
or
vermont?
i
mean,
you
said
in
utah
there
would
be
no
one
who
can
get
another
$145
million--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you
could
multiple
that
by
50.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
isn't
there
a
certain
irony
in
that
it
was
chopped
down
to
$25
million,
and
then
the
utah
supreme
court,
using
this
court's
case
law,
saying
we
don't
give
the
ordinary
deference
that
we
would
give
to
that
judgment
of
the
trial
court,
because
the
supreme
court
had
told
us
we
must
engage
in
de
novo
review,
and
engaging
in
de
novo
review,
we
don't
chop
it
down,
we
put
it
back
to
where
it
was
originally.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tribe,
i
thought
you
answered--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tribe,
you're
talking
about
a
second
utah
plaintiff.
i
thought
you
answered--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--several
questions
ago
you
said
this
could
be
multiplied
at
least
50
times.
that
is,
one
big
winner
in
each
state.
