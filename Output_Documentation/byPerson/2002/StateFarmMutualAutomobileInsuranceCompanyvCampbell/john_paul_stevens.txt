justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
number
01-1289,
state
farm
mutual
v.
campbell
and
others.
ms.
birnbaum,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
birnbaum,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
the
other
side,
what
is
at
issue
is
a
policy
that
your
company
had
over
the
years,
i
forget
the
name
of
it,
bp
and
something
or
other,
and
i
looked
for
that
policy
in
the
record,
and
i
couldn't
find
it.
is
it
in
the
record?
is
there
a
written--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
a
lodging?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
suggest
an
analogy?
this,
in
a
way
this
reminds
me
of
the
argument
we
heard
last
week...
maybe
it
was
last
session...
about
the
three
strikes
law
in
california;
that
you're
not
necessarily
punished
for
the
other
things
you
did,
but
you
can
take
into
account
your
prior
crimes
even
in
other
states
in
order
to
justify
a
more
severe
penalty
for
what
you've
done
here.
and
isn't
it...
part
of
the
argument
the
other
side
makes
is
that
this
is
a
very
large
company,
and
the
board
of
directors
doesn't
hear
about
a
$100
million
punitive
damage
award
down
in
texas,
and
therefore
you've
got
to
at
least
give
them
enough
money
so
the
board
of
directors
will
know
they
ought
to
take
corrective
steps.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
ms.
birnbaum.
mr.
tribe,
we'll
hear
from
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
interrupt
with
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sure
you're
going
to
get
to
it,
but
one
can
infer...
maybe
it's
not
entirely
clear...
that
all
of
this
was
established,
and
there
are
very,
very
many,
many
bad,
bad
deeds
done
in
all
parts
of
the
united
states,
but
that
the
$145
million
is
in
large
part
punishment
for
what
was
done
outside
of
utah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
point
that
relates
to
that
is
that
when
the
supreme
court
of
utah
made
the
comparison
to
what
the
criminal
penalty
might
have
been,
they
had
to
be
referring
to
more
than
what
could
have
been
imposed
in
utah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
utah?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
you've
told
me
that
this
is
all
based
on
what
happened
in
utah.
i
haven't
read
this
massive
record,
and
you
tell
me
you
have.
in
the
second
phase
of
the
punitive
damages
trial,
not
the
first
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--when
they
did
get
into
out
of
state
evidence,
what
proportion,
in
your
judgment,
of
that
evidence
related
to
utah,
and
what
proportion
related
to
other
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
telling
me
that
over
half
of
the
evidence
related
to
utah
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
correct
in
telling
us
that
this...
there's
only
one
example
of
a
failure
to
settle--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
there
must
have
been
a
lot
of
records--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
they
didn't
destroy
all
the
evidence
to
have
a
trial
go
on
this
long.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
one
other
question
just
about
the
proceedings
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
record
is
so
large
i
didn't
have
the
whole
thing
completely
in
mind.
after
the
trial
judge
reduced
the
jury's
award
of
$145
million
to...
what
was
it,
$20
million?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--$25
million,
state
farm
still
appealed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
did
both
sides
appeal
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
it
wasn't
clear
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
thinking
it
would
have
been
quite
a
shock
if
state
farm
had
been
the
only
appellant
here
and
that
was
the
result
of
that
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
sort
of
dramatic,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
both
sides
appealed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what's
the
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
professor
tribe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
argument
is
that
this
is
all
utah
damages,
so
there
are--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--49
other
claims
out
there
that
must
be
at
least
as
valuable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wasn't
that
after
the
trial?
i
thought
that
was
in
the
petition
for
reconsideration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
about--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
have,
i
think,
a
minute
and
a
half...
but
let's
make
it
two
and
a
half.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
disagree
with
mr.
tribe's
suggestion
that
over
half
the
evidence
related
to
utah?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
the
utah
evidence
was
evidence
relating
to
this
particular
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--rather
than
to
other
utah
policyholders.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
ms.
birnbaum.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
we've
got
your
position.
the
case
is
submitted.
