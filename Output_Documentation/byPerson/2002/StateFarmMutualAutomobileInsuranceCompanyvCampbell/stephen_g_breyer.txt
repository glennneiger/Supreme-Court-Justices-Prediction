justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
answer
is
that
all
that
does
go
to
reprehensibility.
it
does.
a
person
who
commits
this
conduct
and
is
part
of
a
company
that
engages
in
all
kinds
of
bad
action
is
a
person
who
is
somewhat
more
reprehensible
than
if
you
worked
for
a
company
that
doesn't
engage
in
all
this
bad
action,
but
i
thought
your
point
was
that
that's
true,
but
unless
you
draw
a
line
like
the
line
that
was
drawn
in
gore,
you
are
inviting
a
jury
to
punish
the
company
for
all
kinds
of
things
that
truly
do
make
them
more
reprehensible,
but
without
standards,
without
a
legislature
telling
them
how
reprehensible,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
just
saying
how
rich
they
are.
i
mean,
the
question...
whether
they're
rich
or
not,
they
seem
quite
rich,
but
maybe
they're
not,
but
the
harm
here
was
what?
that
is
he
had
a
$50,000
policy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he
for
a
period
of
time
the
client
thought
that
he'd
have
to
pay
$136,000
out
of
his
own
pocket,
for
how
long
a
period
of
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
for
18
months
he's
frightened
that
he'll
have
to
pay
$136,000
out
of
his
own
pocket,
all
right.
now,
because
of
that
fright,
he
was
given
a
million
dollars
in
compensation
and
another
$145
million...
i
don't
know,
how
much
went
to
him?
how
much
went
to
the
lawyers?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--$56
million
goes
to
the
lawyers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
much
went
to
him?
how
much
went
to
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
$14
million
went
to
him,
and
where
did
the
rest
go?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
that's
all
necessary
for
the
follow...
or
at
least
not
necessary,
reasonable
for
the
following
reason.
this
is
a
very
big
company,
and
unless
you
really
make
them
pay
they
might
do
this
again,
or
if
not
this,
something
equally
bad,
okay?
now,
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is,
there
is
a
claim.
even
if
it's
out
of
proportion
to
the
harm,
we've
got
to
wake
these
people
up
at
state
farm.
now,
they
get
wakened
up
by
this
145
million
judgment,
believe
me,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
now...
all
right.
now,
what's
your
response
to
that,
that's
a
very
desirable
and
necessary
thing,
or
they
might
do
it
again?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
suppose
there
had
been
10
cases
in
which
10
other
people
were
frightened
of
having
to
pay
$136,000
for
a
period
of
18
months.
then,
in
your
opinion,
would
it
have
been
justified
to
enter
this
judgment
of
$145
million
to
wake
them
up?
indeed,
at
4
month
intervals
they
kept
doing
this
over
and
over.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
the
policy
is,
pay
as
little
as
possible,
even
if
fraud
is
necessary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
i
see
that,
but
what's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
companies
would
have
a
policy
of
trying
to
make
as
much
money
as
possible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
some
companies
could
add--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--could
add
to
that,
by
the
way,
one
way
we
make
money
is,
we
pay
out
as
little
as
possible
and
we
charge
as
much
as
possible.
i
remember
an
airline
that
had
the
policy,
charge
the
customer
the
highest
price
he
will
pay
for
the
service
that
he
wants,
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
could
be
such
a
policy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oh,
no,
no,
but
by
the
way--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
might
be
that
such
a
policy
would
even
condone
doing
a
lot
of
bad
things
to
do
that,
and
what's
worrying
me
about
permitting
that
kind
of
policy
to
serve
as
a
justification
for
a
$145
million
judgment
is
precisely
what
i
wrote
in
my
concurrence
in
the
bmw
case,
that
the
constitution,
indeed
the
magna
carta
says
that
you
should
not
take
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
law;
and
to
take
12
people,
call
them
a
jury,
selected
at
random,
and
tell
them
that
they
are
free
to
go
through
the
business
practices
of
a
company--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
unite
them
under
the
name
of
a
policy
and
then
assess
$145
million
for
every
bad
thing
that
this
jury
thinks--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
that's
bothering
me--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
was
referring
to
them,
and
my
problem
is
that
in
fact
what
you
have
is
a
system
where
if
you
take,
let's
call
it
the
most
evil
corporation
in
the
world,
and
i'm
sure
there
are
some
such,
and
they
commit
a
very
minor
tort
in
respect
to
someone,
pursuant
to
their
policy
of
being
evil--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
criminal
laws,
there
are
regulatory
authorities,
there
are
statutes--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
is
common
law,
there
are
many,
many
sources
of
law;
and
it's
disturbing
in
terms
of
the
picture
of
the
law
to
have
12
people
picked
at
random
to
assess
an
enormous
fine
without
standards
other
than,
"this
defendant
is
evil",
and
i'm
assuming
he
is
evil.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
i'm
trying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
get
you
to
say
what
the
standard
was,
if
it
is
not
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean,
you
could
right
in
this
case
put
people
in
prison
for--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no,
i
mean,
you'd
have
to
bring
another
trial,
wouldn't
you?
