justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
say
the
evidence
of
conduct
in
other
jurisdictions
should
have
been
excluded,
it
was
inadmissible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
it
does
go
to
reprehensibility
if
we're
giving
some
kind
of
an
ethical
report
card
to
state
farm.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
does
not
go
to
reprehensibility,
i
would
think
would
be
your
point,
as
to
the
harm
suffered
by
this
plaintiff.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
seems
to
me
the
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
that's
all
that
was
offered
in
gore,
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
didn't
really
have
to
reach
your
question
in
that
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
would
you
formulate
the
standard
that
you
want
us
to
adopt,
the
standard
which
confines
the
reprehensibility
evidence
to
what
you
deem
to
be
appropriate
in
a
case
such
as
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
rule
do
we
have?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
then
you
have
no
concern
with
punishing
for
acts
that
took
place
out
of
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
abandoning
that,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
i
don't
understand
where
we
are
on
the
out
of
state.
you
say
you're
going
to
get
to
that
under
another--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--prong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
99
cents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
i
suppose
to
the
extent
it's
relevant
it
is,
that
you
need
an
awfully
big
award
against
an
awfully
big
company,
because
you
want
the
company
itself
to
take
corrective
steps,
and
if
this
$100
million
award
isn't
even
called
to
the
attention
of
the
board
of
directors,
maybe
that
says
you
needed
a
larger
award
than
would
otherwise
be
justified.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
this
jury--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
the
bright
line
be
helpful
if
we
said,
up
to...
pick
a
number...
10
times
will
be
usually
accepted
unless
that
is
not
adequate
enough
to
compensate
the
plaintiff
for
the
wrong
that
was
done
to
him?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
was
the
sole
ground
of
liability,
was
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
basis
of
the
underlying
tort,
which
was
the
failure...
which
was
the
excess.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
was
the
excess.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--nothing
you
have
said,
mr.
tribe,
professor,
persuades
me
that
the
jury
didn't
punish
this
company
for
being
a
bad
company
quite
without
reference--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
the
harm
this
plaintiff
suffered.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
some
people
get
part
of
it
that
weren't
hurt
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
wasn't
referring
to
the
lawyers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
was
referring
to
the
other
people
that
took
an
assignment
of
the
claim
together
with--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
again,
you're
defining
reprehensibility
quite
without
regard
to
the
specific
injury
imposed
on
the
plaintiff.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
defining...
you're
giving
a
report
card
to
the
entire
company.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think...
justice
breyer
touched
on
this.
part
of
the
harm
to
the
larger
community
here
is
the
image
that
this
does
to
the
judicial
system
when
corporations,
businesses,
people
of
substance
want
to
use
the
courts
and
they're
deterred
from
doing
it
by
the
threat
of
runaway
punitive
damages,
and
that
is
not
good
for
the
legal
system.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
if
there
were
in
utah
a
second
campbell,
a
second
excess
carrier,
and
the
case
was
tried
6
months
later.
would
they
get
the
same
punitive
damages?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
both
hypothetical
plaintiffs
are
injured
around
the
time
campbell
is,
and
they
both
bring
the
same
kind
of
suit
and
they
have
the
same
evidence;
they
each
get
the
145?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case
from
the
utah
supreme
court,
we
addressed
once
again
the
subject
of
punitive
damages.
curtis
campbell
was
insured
by
state
farm
insurance
company
and
he
ended
up
suing
his
own
company.
the
background
was
this.
campbell
and
his
wife
were
driving
on
a
two-lane
high
way
in
utah;
campbell
decided
to
pass
six
vans
traveling
ahead
of
him.
this
resulted
in
an
accident
that
caused
one
driver
his
life
and
rendered
another
permanently
disabled.
campbell
escaped
unscathed.
campbell
was
sued
and
the
insurance
company
state
farm
turned
down
a
settlement
offer
for
the
$50,000
policy
limit.
the
jury
found
campbell
a
100%
at
fault
and
returned
a
verdict
for
about
$185,000.
so,
there
is
an
excess
amount
over
the
policy
limit
of
$135,000.
at
first,
state
farm
refused
to
pay
the
excess,
later
it
agreed
to
do
so
but
campbell
sued
state
farm
nonetheless
alleging
bad
faith,
fraud
and
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
in
campbell's
suit
against
state
farm,
the
jury
awarded
him
$2.6
million
in
compensatory
damages
and
$145
million
in
punitive
damages.
the
trial
court
ordered
the
compensatory
damages
reduced
to
$1
million
and
the
punitive
damages
reduced
to
$25
million.
utah
supreme
court
reinstated
the
$145
million
punitive
damage
award
and
this
is
the
decision
we
now
review.
sstate
have
discretion
over
the
imposition
of
punitive
damages.
it
is
well
established
though
that
there
are
procedural
and
substantive
constitutional
limitations
on
those
awards.
in
bmw
of
north
america
versus
gore,
we
instructed
courts
reviewing
punitive
damages
to
consider
three
guideposts:
first,
the
degree
of
reprehensibility
of
the
defendant's
misconduct;
second,
the
disparity
between
the
harm
sufferend
by
the
plaintiff
and
the
punitive
damages
award,
and
third,
the
difference
between
the
punitive
damages
awarded
by
the
jury
and
civil
penalties
authorized
or
imposed
in
comparable
cases.
under
these
principles,
this
case
is
neither
close
nor
difficult.
it
was
error
to
reinstate
the
jury's
$145
million
punitive
damages
award.
in
applying
the
first
gore
guidepost,
we
must
acknowledge
that
state
farm's
handling
of
the
claims
against
campbell
merits
no
praise.
while
we
do
not
suggest
there
was
an
error
in
awarding
any
punitive
damages
based
upon
state
farm's
conduct
toward
campbell,
a
more
modest
punishment
for
this
reprehensible
conduct
could
have
satisfied
the
state's
legitimate
objectives.
the
utah
courts
should
have
gone
no
further.
the
case
instead
was
used
as
a
platform
to
expose
and
punish
the
perceived
deficiencies
of
state
farm's
operation
throughout
the
country.
the
utah
supreme
court's
opinion
makes
explicit
that
state
farm
was
being
condemned
for
its
nationwide
policies,
rather
than
for
the
conduct
directed
to
campbell.
from
opening
statements
onward
campbell
framed
this
case
as
a
chance
to
rebuke
state
farm
for
its
nationwide
activities.
the
state
cannot
punish
a
defendant
for
conduct
that
may
have
been
lawful
where
it
occured
nor
as
a
general
rule
does
a
state
have
a
legitimate
concern
in
imposing
punitive
damages
to
punish
a
defendant
for
unlawful
acts
commited
outside
of
the
state's
jurisdiction.
lawful-out-of-state
conduct
maybe
probative
where
it
demonstrates
the
deliberateness
and
culpability
of
the
defendant's
action
in
the
state
where
it
is
tortious,
but
that
conduct
must
have
a
nexus
to
the
specific
harm
suffered
by
the
plaintiff.
also,
the
the
utah
courts
erred
in
relying
upon
this
and
other
evidence
for
a
fundamental
reason.
punitive
damages
were
awarded
to
punish
and
deter
conduct
that
borne
no
relation
to
campbell's
harm.
the
defendant's
dissimilar
acts
independent
from
the
acts
upon
which
liability
was
premised
may
not
serve
as
the
basis
for
punitive
damages.
due
process
does
not
permit
courts
in
the
calculation
of
punitive
damages
to
adjudicate
the
merits
of
other
parties'
hypothetical
claims
against
the
defendant
under
the
guise
of
the
reprehensibility
analysis.
turning
to
the
second
gore
guidepost,
we
have
been
reluctant
to
identify
concrete
constitutional
limits
on
the
ratio
between
the
harm
that
the
plaintiff
usually
reflected
in
the
compensatory
damages
award
and
the
punitive
damage
award.
our
jurisprudence
and
the
principles
have
now
established
demonstrate,
however,
that
in
practice,
few
awards
exceeding
a
single-digit
ratio
between
punitve
and
compensatory
damages
will
satisfy
due
process,
and
compensatory
damages
are
substantial
moreover
than
a
lesser
ratio
perhaps
only
equal
to
compensatory
damages
can
reach
the
outermost
limit
of
the
due
process
guarantee.
in
the
context
of
this
case,
we
have
no
doubt
that
there
is
a
presumption
against
an
award
that
has
145:1
ratio.
with
respect
to
the
third
gore
guidepost,
the
most
relevant
civil
sanction
under
utah
law
for
the
wrong
done
to
campbell
appears
to
be
a
$10,000
fine
for
an
act
of
fraud,
an
amount
dwarfed
by
the
$145
million
punitive
damages
award.
an
application
of
the
gore
guidepost
to
the
facts
of
this
case
likely
would
justify
a
punitive
damages
award
at
or
near
the
amount
of
compensatory
damages.
the
punitive
award
of
$145
million
was
neither
reasonable
nor
proportionate
to
the
wrong
committed,
and
it
was
an
irrational
and
arbitrary
deprivation
of
the
property
of
the
defendant.
the
judgment
of
the
utah
supreme
court
is
reversed.
justices
scalia,
thomas
and
ginsburg
have
each
filed
disserting
opinions.
