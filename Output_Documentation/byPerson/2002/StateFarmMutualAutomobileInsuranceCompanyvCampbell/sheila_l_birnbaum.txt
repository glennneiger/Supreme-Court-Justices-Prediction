ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arose
from
a
single
failure
by
state
farm
to
settle
a
third
party
automobile
case
in
the
state
of
utah
within
the
policy
limits
of
its
insured
in
utah.
there
was
evidence
in
the
record,
uncontroverted
evidence,
that
this
was
the
only
case
in
the
state
of
utah
where
a
policyholder
of
state
farm
had
been
subject
to
potentially
a
threat
of
execution
on
a
judgment.
all
of
the
other
judgments
that
were
in
excess
of
policy
limits,
which
there
were
seven
of
in
the
state
of
utah
over
a
14-year
period,
including
both
before
and
after
mr.
campbell's
case--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
it's
in
the
lodging,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
it's
at
1506
to
1531
in
the
lodging,
and
if
you
look
at
the
b,
so-called
pp&r...
it's
called
the
performance
planning
and
review
manual...
it
is
a
guide.
it
is
a
personnel
evaluation
guide
on
how
to
evaluate
personnel,
and
it
applies
to
all,
all
the
personnel
of
state
farm,
all
thousands
of
personnel,
and
what
the
plaintiff
did
was
to
cherry-pick
from
this
long
manual
which
is
in
the
lodging,
as
i
said,
one
or
two
points
that
didn't
even
apply
to
claims
adjustors
or
claims
representatives,
but
to
supervisors,
to
try
to
create
this
pervasive
nationwide
scheme
that
there
was
an
attempt
by
state
farm
over
20
years
to
lessen
the
claims
that
they
were
paying
and
not
pay
the
fair
value
of
claims.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
you
may
have
to
take
that
as
a
given,
your
honor,
but
the
question
becomes,
how
is
that
policy
related
in
any
way
to
this
decision
to
try
a
case
in
the
state
of
utah,
and
how
can
state
farm
be
punished
for
its
nationwide
conduct,
when
all
this
case
was
about,
and
should
have
been
about--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--your
honor,
some
evidence
could
have
come
in
under
this
court's
determination
in
bmw
to
show
reprehensibility,
but
evidence
that
could
have
come
in
to
show
reprehensibility
had
to
be
comparable
to
the
conduct
that
was
at
stake
here.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
your
honor,
the
record
is
replete
in
our
opening
brief.
we
cite
to
the
many
times
all
of
this
evidence
came
in
on
direct,
of
the
plaintiff's
experts
and
the
plaintiff's
so-called
fact
experts.
that's
a
makeshift
argument.
this
didn't
just
come
in.
this
was
a
2
and
month
trial
on...
and
most
of
that
trial
was
geared
to
this
nationwide
scheme.
and
more
importantly,
if
you
look
at
what
the
utah
supreme
court
said
in
reinstating
this
incredibly
excessive
verdict,
145
to
1,
when
you
look
at
that,
it
is
very
clear
that
the
utah
supreme
court
was
looking
at
a
national
scheme.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
and
it's
all
cited
in
our
brief,
in
our
opening
brief,
many,
many
times.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
your
honor,
there
was
not,
because
that
wasn't
necessary
in
the
state
of
utah.
if
a
litigant
objects
in
limine
to
the
introduction
of
this
evidence,
which
was
done--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--that
was
many
times
done,
and
your
honor,
when
this
court
came
down
with
the
case
of
bmw
v.
gore,
there
was
an
oral
argument
made
that
that
kind
of
evidence
was
unconstitutional
under
gore,
because
it
was
dissimilar
and
extraterritorial.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
because,
your
honor,
if
we
are...
if
we
permit
litigants
to
create
this
overriding
scheme
that
you
are
engaged
in
fraud
in
all
your
business
practices,
and
that
you
can
be
punished
for
that,
it
is
as
if
in
gore--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--your
honor--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--absolutely.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
absolutely.
your
honor--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--well,
your
honor--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--your
honor,
because
in
gore
v.
bmw
this
court,
the
majority
of
this
court
held
that
you
can
introduce
on
the
reprehensibility
question
similar
conduct
that
compares
to
the
conduct
that
occurred
to
the
particular
plaintiff
in
the
underlying
case.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
but
that...
but
your
honor,
it
would
be
like--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--your
honor,
but
it
would
be
like
in
gore
saying
that
there
was
a
plan
to
maximize
profits,
and
that
not
only
could
you
introduce
and
consider
the
repair
issues
that
occurred
in
gore,
but
you
could
also
show
that
there
was
discrimination
against
minority
customers,
that
there
was--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--i
couldn't
have
said
it
any
better,
your
honor.
[laughter]
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
well,
i
think--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--no.
no,
you
have--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--because
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
happened
here,
and
i'd
like
to
explain
to
you.
maybe
it's
a
little...
but
what
happens
in
third
party
and
first
party
cases,
in
this
particular
case
there
was
a
decision
to
go
to
trial.
why
was
that
decision
made
to
go
to
trial?
because
at
least
the
lawyers
for
state
farm
in
some
of
the
claims
represented
felt
this
was
a
no
liability
case.
mr.
and
mrs.
campbell
said
that
they
were
not
liable,
that
they
didn't
cause
this
accident.
this
wasn't
a
no-brainer.
there
was
evidence.
the
jury
decided
on
other
evidence.
but
when
you
bring
into
this
equation
20
years
of
conduct
that,
some
of
it
that
is
lawful,
this
wasn't
only
fraudulent
conduct.
this
jury
heard
and
was
instructed...
not
instructed,
but
in
the
summation
there
was
references
to
the
payment
of
non-oem,
the
specification
of
non-oem
parts,
was
perfectly
legal
in
almost
every
jurisdiction.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
i
think--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--i
think,
your
honor,
the
proper
reprehensibility
inquiry
is
limited
to
an
examination
of
a
defendant's
specific
misconduct
toward
the
plaintiff
and
similar
conduct
by
the
defendant
toward
others,
but
it
has
to
be
similar.
this
was
not
similar
conduct
requiring--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--but
the
question
here
was,
was
there
a
bad
faith
failure
to
settle?
that
is
the
conduct.
if
there
was
evidence
of
bad
faith
failure
to
settle
in
other
states,
that
could
come
in
on
reprehensibility.
that
could
inform
the
jury
in
some
way,
and
under
bmw
v.
gore,
you
said
that
that
kind
of
conduct,
similar
conduct
in
bmw
was
identical
conduct.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
no,
i--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--we
have
not
gotten
to
the
ratio
of
the
comparable
penalties
questions
under
bmw.
we
were
just
focusing
on
reprehensibility.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
exactly
what
the
court--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--no,
it
would
not.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
it's
the
conduct--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--it
was
the
conduct
that
occurred
in
that
case.
in
that
case
there
was
a
failure
to
tell
consumers--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--that
the
car
had
a--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--if
you
open
it
up
to
all
kinds
of
other
defects,
then
you're
opening
it
up--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--you're
opening
it
up--
[laughter]
--to
the
kind
of
thing
that
can
happen
here,
especially
if
it
gets
punished.
in
this
case
there
was
a
million
dollars'
worth
of
compensatory
damages,
a
substantial
number,
and
this
verdict
was
145
times
that.
that
could
only
be
considered
because
it
was
punishing
all
of
this
extraterritorial,
dissimilar,
and
in
many
instances,
lawful
conduct.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
the
really
important
thing
here
is
that
the
utah
supreme
court--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--yes.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
under
ratio
and
comparable
penalties,
your
honor.
because
this
court
has
said
that
you
could
introduce
extraterritorial
conduct,
similar,
past
conduct
with
regard
to
reprehensibility,
but
there
are
three
guideposts
in
gore,
and
the
utah
supreme
court
ignored
the
other
two
guideposts.
of
course,
when
it
came
to
the
ratio
guidepost,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
relationship,
reasonable
ratio
between
the
penalty,
the
punishment,
and
the
harm
to
the
plaintiff:
not
the
harm
to
others,
not
the
harm
to
the
community
at
large,
not
the
harm
to
all
of
the
consumers
that
dealt
with
state
farm,
as
the
utah
supreme
court
held
and
found,
and--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--here,
your
honor,
there
was
a
compensatory
damage
award
of
a
million
dollars.
that
was
a
substantial
compensatory
award.
the
ratio
that
would
be
reasonable
with
regard
to
a
million
dollars
could
not
be
145
to
1.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
as
long--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--but
even
if
there
is
a
ratio,
what
reprehensibility
does
is
put
you
on
the
continuum
of
blameworthiness,
and
this
court
has
said
previously
that
4
to
1
is
close
to
the
line.
in
txo
it
permitted
10
to
1
because
economic
damages
was
small,
and
you
looked
at
potential
harm
as
well
as
the
realized
harm
to
the
litigant
there.
here,
he
had
substantial
compensatory
damages.
in
addition,
if
you
look
at
the
third
guidepost
in
gore,
you
have
comparable
penalties
and
sanctions
for
comparable
conduct.
that's
how
that
is
defined.
what
was
the
conduct
here?
it
was
a
failure
to
settle
within
policy
limits.
it
wasn't
intentional
tort;
it
was--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--could
i
just
first
answer
this
$100
million
punitive
damage
award,
because
i
think
that
really
shows
where
the
utah
supreme
court
is
going.
there
was
no
judgment.
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
bad
faith
failure
to
settle.
it
had
to
do
with
an
uninsured
motorist
coverage.
the
case
was
settled
for
pennies
on
the
dollar.
there
was
no--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--pennies.
pennies.
unfortunately
i
couldn't
put
into
evidence
the
amount
because
there
as
a
confidentiality
agreement,
but
that
case
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
kind
of
conduct
here.
you
cannot--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--your
honor,
i
think
if
you
look
at
this,
this
was
a
jury
award
that
was
never
made
into
a
judgment.
why
would
anybody...
it
was
settled.
it
was
a
runaway
verdict
in
a
place.
why
would
anybody
go
to
the
board
of
directors
with
something
like
that?
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
okay.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
the
answer
to
that
is,
first
of
all,
surplus
was
the
wrong
number
to
ever
focus
on.
that
money
is
accounted
for,
and
there
are
some
very
good
briefs,
amicus
briefs
that
talk
about
surplus.
there
was
never
a
profit
from
underwriting
in
this
particular
instance,
and
the
fact
that
the
company
has
surpluses,
that's
to
pay
out
claims.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
yes.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
there
is
a
question
in
the
record.
the
trial
court
said
that
it
was
for
a
short
period
of
time.
the
utah
supreme
court
said
it
was
for
18
months.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
well,
your
honor,
there
would
be
40
percent
that
would
go
to
the
lawyers--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--and
under
the
agreement
the--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--right.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
10
percent
of
the
award
was--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--it
went
to
the
two
other
plaintiffs
in
the
original
case.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
the
response
to
that,
your
honor,
is
there's
nothing
in
this
record...
first
of
all,
that
kind
of
ratio
is
totally
unreasonable
and
out
of
proportion
to
the
harm
to
the
plaintiff.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
yes.
there's
no
question
of
that.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
it's
not
a
necessary
thing
on
this
record,
it
is
not
a
desirable
thing.
there
was
no--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--there
was
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
there
was
any
other
case
in
which
there
had
been
a
failure
to
settle
within
policy
limits
that
jeopardized
an
insuree--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--your
honor,
if
that
happened,
then
each
one
of
those
plaintiffs
could
have
a
bad
faith
failure
to
settle
claim
in
which
they
could
have
gotten
punitive
damages
in
their
own
states.
there
is
no...
this
whole
concept
that
this
is
a
clandestine
scheme,
every--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--well,
that's
what--
[laughter]
that's
what
the
supreme
court
of
utah
said,
even
though
it's
not
in
their
statute.
can
you
imagine,
on
fair
notice,
when
we
talked
about
fair
notice,
that
you
could
go
to
jail
for
a
failure
to
settle
one
case
in
the
state
of
utah?
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
no,
they
didn't.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
i
think
you've
already
put
that
in
your
opinions
in
this
court
already,
and
that
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
relationship
between
the
amount
of
the
punitive
damages
and
the
compensatory
harm
to
the
plaintiff.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
well,
i
think
you
grapple
with
that
only
by
looking
at
the
three
guideposts
that
you've
already
put
forth,
and
it
could
be
4,
it
could
be
5,
and
some
courts
have
even
held
10,
but
most
of
the
courts
that
have
followed
your
jurisprudence
have
held
that
3,
or
4,
or
5
is
close
to
the
line.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
now,
we're
not
asking
you
to
put
a
bright
line.
it
would
be
helpful,
but
i
don't
think
this
court
is
prepared
to
do
that.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
that
would
be
an
excellent
way
of
drawing
the
line,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
your
honor,
we
get
it
out
of
due
process,
the
two
bedrock
provisions
called
due
process
and
federalism.
federalism,
comity,
states'
rights.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
no,
we're
not
suggesting
that.
i
thought
it
was
a
good
idea,
however.
[laughter]
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
right.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
well,
it
might
not
have
been
totally
the
same
that--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--it's
in
the
lodging
at
394.
it
was
instruction
number
46.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
that's
right--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--right.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
right.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
absolutely,
your
honor.
let
me
just
mention
one
other
part
of
the
guideposts
which
i
think
are
very
relevant
here,
and
that
is
comparable
penalties
for
comparable
misconduct,
and
here
it
is
uncontroverted
that
the
penalty
that
the
utah
courts
or
the
utah
system
could
have
placed
on
state
farm
for
an
act,
for
a
single
act
of
bad
faith
failure
to
settle,
which
was
at
stake
here,
was
$10,000.
yet
when
the
utah
supreme
court
examined
that
guidepost
from
the
court,
it
looked
at
the
scheme.
it
looked
at
all
of
the
nationwide
conduct
to
determine
that
1)
you
could
be...
you
would
have
to
disgorge
all
your
profits
or
you
could
be
imprisoned,
which
was
not
correct
anyhow
under
the
utah
statute.
but
if
you
restate
the
guideposts
that
you
have
already
come
down
with,
and
you
make
it
clear
that
we're
talking
about
conduct
that
was
permitted
to
the
plaintiffs,
that
we're
talking
about
reasonable
ratios
that
had
to
do
with
the
plaintiff's
wrong,
not
harm
to
others,
not
harm
to
all
of
those
in
utah...
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
bad
faith
failure
to
settle
issue,
there
was
no
one
in
the
state
of
utah
that
was
harmed
by
that
kind
of
conduct.
there
was
nobody
that
was
even
subject,
justice
breyer,
for
a
short
time
with
execution,
and
that...
and
there
was
no
reason,
there
was
no
reason
to
deter
that
kind
of
conduct
because
there
was
no
conduct
in
the
future,
after
the
campbell
case,
that
that
even
came
close
to.
so
i
think
that
if
you
focus
on
those
factors,
those
guideposts
that
you
elucidated
to
in
gore,
and
make
them
stronger,
that
would
be
sufficient
for
the
lower
courts
to
do
their
job
in
doing
a
meaningful...
meaningful
appellate
review,
not
the
kind
of
review
here
that
was
based
on
questionable
conclusions
and
improper
predicates.
thank
you.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
do
i
have
a
little
time,
can
i
just...
left
to
respond?
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
two
minutes?
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
thank
you,
your
honor,
i
appreciate
that,
because
there
are
certain
things
that
mr.
tribe
said
that
i
think
we
have
to
clarify.
first
of
all,
this
case,
on
the
openings
of
the
plaintiff,
the
plaintiff
said
to
the
jury,
this
case
transcends
the
campbells'
file.
it
involves
a
nationwide
practice.
he
went
on
to
say,
you're
going
to
be
evaluating
and
assessing
and
hopefully
requiring
state
farm
to
stand
accountable
for
what
it
is
doing
across
the
country.
that
is
the
purpose
of
punitive
damages.
on
the
summation,
they
asked
this
jury
to
act
as
a
national
regulator,
because
none
of
the
regulators
had
acted
against
state
farm.
can
you
imagine,
in
a
14...
in
a
20-year
period,
state
farm
handled
approximately
280
million
claims.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
the
only
instruction,
your
honor,
was
the
instruction
that
i
previously
read
to
justice
ginsburg
that
they
should
look
to
the
conduct
toward
the
campbells,
and
that
was
the
instruction.
there
was
no
other
instruction.
but
whether
there
was
an
instruction
or
not,
i
think
as
the
ninth
circuit
just
said
in
white
v.
ford,
you
have
to
look
at
the
evidence,
the
openings,
the
closings,
and
what
was
punished
here.
it
was
a
scheme,
and
the
scheme
had
no
causal
relationship
with
the
decision
to
try
this
case.
you
asked,
justice
stevens,
how
much
of
the
evidence
was
extraterritorial?
huge
amounts,
and
it
came
in
on
direct,
and
we
have
it
cited
in
our
brief,
and
it
wasn't
only--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--no,
your
honor.
it
related
to
mr.
campbell's
underlying
case,
not
to
actions
in
utah
that
harmed
utah
policyholders.
that
was
all
inferred
from
this
large
national
scheme.
in
fact,
the
evidence
is
contrary.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
absolutely.
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
and
if
you
look
at
the
footnote
in
their
brief,
and
look
at
our
reply
brief,
we
point
out
all
of
that
evidence
had
to
do
with
the
underlying
case.
the
lawyers
from
the
underlying
case,
mr.
campbell,
mrs.
campbell,
ospital,
slusher
et
cetera,
and
this
issue
of
whether
there
was
one,
whether
this...
mr.
campbell
was
vulnerable,
mr.
campbell
was
the
only
person
in
this
whole
trial
that
wasn't
vulnerable.
he
was
a
60-year-old
white
man
and
who
had
a
b.a.
and
an
m.a.
he
sat
through
the
entire
trial
and
he
said
he
was
not
liable,
and
the
decision
was
made
that
this
was
a
no
liability
case.
mr.
tribe
says
ospital
was
not
speeding--
ms.
sheila
l.
birnbaum
--thank
you
so
much.
