mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
might
begin
by
saying
that
i
barely
recognize
the
case
that,
though
i
didn't
try,
i
read
the
transcript
in,
from
hearing
ms.
birnbaum's
description.
she
says
that
the
conduct
involved
in
this
case
was
simply
the
failure
to
settle.
it
wasn't,
she
says,
even
an
intentional
tort.
well,
the
court's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
sole
ground
of
original
liability
was
objectively
unreasonable
failure
to
settle,
but
phase
2,
which
was
held
at
the
insistence
of
plaintiffs,
who
wanted...
of
the
defendants
who
wanted
to
bifurcate,
phase
2
focused
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
an
intentional
tort,
and
there
was
found
to
be
fraud;
and
the
court,
the
trial
court
affirmed
the
judgment
partly
on
the
ground
of
intentional
fraud;
and
the
fraud,
and
it's
not
a
surprise
really
to
the
lawyers
for
the
defendants,
because
they
made
it
clear
in
their
opening
statement
that
they
understood
the
whole
theory
of
this
case
to
be
that
the
insurance
policies
that
were
being
sold
by
state
farm,
which
led
people
to
think
that
in
first
and
in
third
party
cases
the
claims
adjuster
would
try
to
do
a
reasonably
objective
job
of
satisfying
the
claim
if
possible,
in
fact
weren't
bad
at
all.
there
was
a
clandestine
cap
that
was
imposed
by
this
innocuous-looking
bureaucratic
pp&r
program
that
was
thoroughly
documented
and
that
was
imposed
from
headquarters,
documented
elaborately
by
hundreds
of
examples;
and
it's
true,
some
of
them
came
from
other
states,
and
i
will
get
to
that;
but
they
were
all
just
illustrative,
because
it
came
from
headquarters
in
bloomington,
and
it
was
a
directive--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and,
in
fact,
it
was
necessary
here.
that
is,
they
made
up
things.
they
doctored
the
file.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
made
up
the
fact
that...
they
defamed
this
dead
person
and
said
that
he
was
speeding
to
meet
a
pregnant
girlfriend,
who
didn't
exist.
there
were
findings
that
they
systematically
shredded,
and
destroyed,
and
fabricated
documents
for
two
decades
in
order
to
cover
up
the
fact
that
they
were
not
selling
what
they
were
pretending
to
sell.
and
it
was
found
in
this
case
clearly,
and
then
again
de
novo
by
the
utah
supreme
court,
that
this
policy,
which
was
clandestine
and
then
covered
up,
was
a
policy
that
had
persisted
for
two
decades,
which
they
even
now
seem
unwilling
to
acknowledge.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
sure.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
oh,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens.
i
do
plan
to
get
to
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
justice
stevens,
what
they
said
was
this.
they
referred
among
other
things
to
the
utah
unfair
claims
practices
act,
which
said
$10,000
fine
per
violation;
and
there
were
in
their
view
thousands
of
individual
instances
of
wrongfully
denied
benefits.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
in
utah,
yes,
because
they
didn't
draw
this
fancy
distinction
between
first
and
third
party
claims
that
is
being
drawn
for
the
convenience
of
state
farm.
the
wrong
is
not--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
was
the
example--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
kennedy.
that
was
the
tip
of
the
iceberg.
justice
kennedy,
this
is
very
important.
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
the
failure
to
settle
a
case,
and
it
was
a
fraudulent
failure
to
settle
a
case,
not
just
a
random
accident,
but
it
was
pursuant
to
exactly
the
same
policy,
capping
the
average
amount
that
a
given
claims
agents
puts
out
in
terms
of
state
farm
money,
that
is
used
in
these
other
instances.
it
was
exactly
the
same
policy.
in
this
case,
it
was
because
this
fellow
named
bill
brown
wanted
to
move
to
colorado,
and
because
he
did,
and
because
he
was
close
to
his
quota,
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
and
it
is
found...
and
it's
not
disputed
any
longer.
because
he
wanted
to
move
to
colorado,
he
puts
pressure
on
somebody
underneath
him
to
make
sure
that
that
year's
numbers
look
better.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's
not
just
making
as
much
money--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it's
stealing.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
justice
breyer--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and
if
the
policy
is
sell
him
a
ticket
and
then
turn
him
away
at
the
door--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--pretending
to
sell
him
a
place--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
breyer--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
breyer,
please...
i
believe
in
the
magna
carta
as
much
as
you
do.
it
was
not
arbitrary.
there
were
criteria.
the
criteria
were
pursuant
to
an
instruction
proposed
by
state
farm,
and
in
this
case
it
was
not
every
bad
thing.
all
of
the
specifics,
including
these
seemingly
trivial
things
like
appearance
allowances,
were
all
introduced
in
particular
cases
to
show
how
they
were
being
used
by
someone
who
was
up
against
his
monthly
quota,
and
because
he
was
up
against
the
monthly
quota...
you
read
the
testimony
of
gary
fye
at
page
1375
and
1387
of
the
joint
appendix.
because
they
were
up
against
the
monthly
quota,
the
people
at
the
receiving
end
who
thought
they
had
a
claims
agent
who
was,
as
they
call
him,
a
good
neighbor,
in
fact
had
someone
who
was
selling
them
a
place
in
the
airline,
and
it
wasn't
there,
deliberately.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
because
of
the--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
first
of
all,
as
to
the
harm
suffered,
proposed
instruction
40
by
state
farm
would
have
told
the
jury,
i
think
consistent
with
this
court's
jurisprudence
and
with
the
history
of
punitive
damages,
that
they
could
consider
the
effect
of
state
farm's
behavior,
quote,
"on
the
lives
of
plaintiffs
and
of
other
policyholders.
"
and
it's
because,
justice
breyer,
of
what
you
said
in
bmw
that
a
lot
of
other
people
who
are
harmed
by
these
practices
are
not
likely
to
be
able
to
sue.
that
is,
they're
not
going
to
make
it.
mr.
fye
testified
at
30
and
44,
for
everyone
like
campbell,
who
will
take
on
a
company
this
size
and
with
the
resources
of
state
farm,
there
are
hundreds,
if
not
thousands,
who
will
simply
go
away,
because
state
farm--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
that's
the
hope.
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--one
of
the
advantages...
there
may
be
down
sides,
but
if
we
prevail,
justice
ginsburg,
we're
prevailing
on
a
theory
that
the
practice
we've
identified,
which
is
quite
specific,
for
20
years
of
putting
these
invisible
caps
that
cheat
the
insured
in
all
kinds
of
cases
throughout
the
state
of
utah,
there
will
no
longer
be
anyone
who
can
recover
for
those
harms,
beyond
compensatory
damages,
because
the
penalty
will
have
been
extracted.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
if
they've
done
this
in
every
state,
then
they
should
be
exposed
to
the
possibility
of
punitive
damages
in
other
states.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
you
know,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
that
was
delivered
from
the
bench
by
the
district
court
after
2
months,
in
his
own
words...
they
accuse
us
of
writing
his
opinion.
in
his
own
words,
what
he
said
was
that
absent
a
punitive
award,
the
problem
of
recurrence
of
their
misconduct
is
extremely
high,
the
probability
of
recurrence;
because
he
saw
the
evidence
that
they
never
stopped;
and
he
said
that
even
the
$25
million
award
that
he
felt
constrained
by
state
law,
mistakenly,
to
give,
he
thought
would
not
suffice
because...
and
i'm
now
reading
from
his
december
19
opinion...
because
the
$25
million
may
not
be
enough
to
offset
the
profit
that
they're
likely
to
have
earned.
that
is,
every
time
they
cheat
the
insured
by--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
the
overwhelming
majority
related
to
utah,
and
every
time
it
came
in
dealing
with
another
state,
contrary
to
what
we
heard,
it
was
because
the
door
had
been
opened,
and
it
was
specifically
found
by
the
trial
court
that
they
waived
any
objection
to
the
testimony
in
question,
despite
what
we
heard
about--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes,
but
let
me
tell
you,
justice
stevens,
it
was
so
uniform
that
the
particular
examples
were
picked
because
they
so
nicely
illustrated
the
way
a
particular
device
like
the
use
of
non-opm
parts
would
interact
with
the
cap
that
was
imposed.
it
was
nothing
about--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--we
have
no
way
of
knowing,
justice
stevens,
because
they
have
erected...
the
record
also
shows
that
since
the
1970s,
part
of
their
policy
of
destroying
records
has
included--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--getting
rid
of
all
those
records.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it's
because...
part
of
what
was
said
by
the
trial
court
was
that
it
took
the
persistence
of
a
david
to
bring
this
particular
goliath
to
his
knees.
much
of
the
evidence
certainly
wasn't
produced
through
discovery.
the
key
evidence,
including
the
may
1979
pp&r
report,
was
obtained
indirectly
through
other
cases,
not
with
any
cooperation
on
the
part
of
state
farm.
state
farm
kept
saying,
we
don't
have
a
pp&r
policy.
oh,
and
then
we
got
rid
of
it
in
1992;
and
we
got
rid
of
it
again
in
1994;
and
yes,
there's
a
pp&r
policy,
but
it
doesn't
actually
set
the
cap
on
any
particular
claim.
well,
that's
a
nicely
and
artfully
put
point.
it
doesn't.
what
it
does
is,
it
imposes
a
ceiling
which
averages
things
out
and
forces
whoever
is
unlucky
enough
to
come
in
when
somebody
is
about
to
hit
his
ceiling
to
get
cheated.
it
seems
to
me
that
we...
it's
true
that
it
all
began
by
looking
at
this,
as
it
happened,
failure
to
settle.
that's
a
happenstance.
it
could
have
begun
in
some
other
way.
because
it
happened
to
a
couple
that
was
rather
vulnerable,
and
yet
tenacious:
this
fellow
had
had
one
wife
who
had
been
murdered
in
his
home,
another
wife
who
had
died
of
cancer.
he
himself
had
parkinson's
disease.
they
were
part
of
the
weakest
of
the
herd,
as
state
farm's
policies
put
it,
that
they're
picked
on,
because
they're
less
likely
to
fight
back.
but
it
happened
that
these
people
did
fight
back,
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
a
matter
of
rewarding
them.
they
get
a
relatively
small
piece
of
this.
the
family
of
the
dead
young
man
gets
part
of
it.
the
state
may
get
part
of
it.
the
key
point
is
that
it
is
a
critical
disincentive,
and
justice
kennedy,
any
notion--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--some
lawyers
will
certainly
get
part
of
it.
i
don't--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i--
[laughter]
what
made
me
think
you
might
have
been?
no,
but
it
seems--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
could
be,
but--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
breyer,
first,
it's
not
fair
to
say
that
was
the
only
standard.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
second...
second--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
thought
this
court
did
a
rather
good
job
in
bmw.
reprehensibility
could
hardly
be
higher
when
one
has
a
repeat
offender
who
even
now
mischaracterizes
its
intentional
tort,
when
one
has
a
repeat
offender
that
obstructs
justice--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
but
justice
kennedy,
in
txo
this
court
talked
about
the
ratio
not
just
of
the
harm
that
actually
befell
the
particular
plaintiff,
but
of
the
punitive
damages
to
the
harm
that
might
have
befallen
that
plaintiff
if
the
tortious
plan
had
been
carried
to
completion.
here,
if
it
had
been
carried
to
completion
the
home
would
have
been
taken,
because
a
deal
would
not
have
been
struck
in
december
of
'84...
of
'84,
and
also
in
txo,
and
in
other
cases,
you've
spoken
of
the
harm
to
the
larger
community.
you've
also
spoken
of
the
importance
of
extracting
the
profit
from
tortious
behavior.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
kennedy,
i
certainly
agree
in
principle;
but
to
pick
a
case
in
which
a
corporation
has
defied
the
legal
system,
has
shredded
documents,
has
covered
up
its
deliberate
wrongdoing,
has
not
even
bothered
to
pay
attention
to
a
$100
million
award...
yes,
of
course
it
wasn't
reduced
to
a
judgment,
but
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
that
that's
not
relevant.
what
was
critical
is
that
they
had
built
a
wall
of
deniability
so
that
no
one
in
a
decisionmaking
capacity
is
informed
of
punitive
judgments.
mr.
muskowski
testified
in
this
case
that
he
would
not
let
anyone
know,
in
a
position
of
authority,
even
of
the
punitive
judgment
in
this
case;
and
in
their
reply
brief
they
say,
well,
mr.
mendoza
had
decisionmaking
authority,
but
if
you
look
at
the
relevant
pages
in
the
joint
appendix,
you'll
see
that
that's
not
true.
in
the
colloquy
it's
clear
that
he
did
not.
what
that
means
is
that
a
company
can
surround
itself
with
an
impregnable
wall
and
in
effect
spit
at
the
legal
system.
how
good
is
that
for
its
image?
now,
it
may
be
that
an
ideal
legal
system
might
not
use
juries
for
this
purpose,
but
is
it
the
mission
of
this
court
to
redesign
the
legal
systems
of
the
50
states?
15
states
have
signed
an
amicus
brief
here
saying
it's
important
to
them
to
be
able
to
use
punitive
damages
when
the
regulatory
and
criminal
justice
systems
haven't
quite
caught
up
with
whatever
latest
axis
of
evil
is
afoot
in
the
corporate
world.
is
it
really
helpful
to
any
of
us
to
have
a
corporation
be
able
to
defraud
all
of
the
people
who
rely
on
it,
who
depend
on
it,
and
get
away
with
paying
simply
what
harm
they
happened
to
cause
in
the
one
case
when
they
get
caught?
it
seems
to
me
especially
bizarre,
especially
bizarre
for
state
farm
to
speak
here
proudly
of
the
fact
that
this
is
the
worst
case
in
history.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
25.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
there
was
a
cross-appeal
by
state
farm.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
state
farm
appealed
because
it
thought
there
should
be
no
punitives.
it
seems
even
now
they
think
it
did
nothing
wrong.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
there
was
a
cross-appeal
by
the
campbells
on
the
grounds
that
they
thought
it
was
a
mistake
of
state
law
to
have
reduced
the
punitives.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes,
well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
in
a
sense
that
looks
ironic.
it
looks
as
though
cooper
v.
leatherman
came
back
in
a
boomerang,
but
i
think
really
the
way
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
utah
supreme
court,
they
applied
cooper
in
an
even
more
vigorous
way
in
general.
that
is,
they
didn't
just
engage
in
de
novo
review
of
the
question
of
excessiveness.
they
engaged
in
de
novo
review
of
all
the
facts,
so
you
have
not
just
a
jury,
but
a
jury
and
a
trial
court
and
a
full
appellate
court.
the
only
fact
on
which
they
said
they
weren't
going
to
defer
was
a
technical
issue
about
the
wealth
of
state
farm,
and
the
real
reason
they
actually
gave
for
increasing
the
25
to
145
was
their
conviction
that
the
trial
court
believed
that
25
would
not
stop
state
farm
from
persisting
in
its
practices,
and
that
it
was
only
their
own
earlier
suggestion
that
the
ratio
should
matter
a
great
deal
that
had
misled
the
trial
court.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
in
this
case,
sending
them
to
jail
was
an
option
that
the
supreme
court
of
utah
mentioned,
and
that
state
farm
doesn't
seem
to
take
very
seriously.
they
think
the
state
supreme
court
of
utah
doesn't
understand
its
own
law.
there
are
provisions
of
utah
law
that
make
deliberate
fraud
of
the
sort
they
committed
an
imprisonable
offense,
and
maybe
that's
an
option,
but
that
suggests--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
haven't...
i
have
no
contact
with
the
attorney
general
of
utah,
but
they--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
of
course
you...
yes.
yes,
but
the
comparability
standard
asks,
how
serious
an
offense
is
this,
and
i
submit
it's
extremely
serious.
but
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
on
ratio,
i
think
that
instead
of
trying
to
come
up
with
a
number...
because
i
think
suggesting
any
number
would
be
so
arbitrary
that
it
would
do
more
damage
to
this
court
than
good
to
the
legal
system.
it's
not
like
6
months
for
the
idea
of
a
serious
crime.
i
mean,
it
would
just
be
a
number
plucked
from
the
air,
and
it
would
backfire,
because
as
the
law
and
economics
people
are
fond
of
pointing
out,
any
number
you
pick
will
then
lead
people
to
sort
of
modify
their
behavior
accordingly,
and
just
internalize
the
costs
on
a
kind
of
bad
man
theory,
and
what
you
really
are
trying
to
do
is
stop
the
behavior.
we're
not
talking
about
negligence
here.
we're
talking
about
something
of
which
the
optimal
level
is
zero.
the
optimal
level
of
deliberate
fraud
and
deception
covered
up
in
this
way
is
zero.
the
relevance
of
the
ratio,
i
think,
is
simply
as
one
thing
to
look
at.
if
the
ratio
looks
very
high,
you
ask
why
is
it
so
high?
in
this
case,
the
answer
comes
back,
it's
so
high
because
the
ratio
of
the
number
of
people
they
hurt
to
the
number
who
are
going
to
be
motivated
to
sue
and
able
to
sue
is
very
low.
i
mean,
is
very...
you
know,
a
number...
a
huge
number
will
be
hurt.
a
very
small
number
are
going
to
be
able
to
make
it
through
that
filter.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
suppose.
i
suppose,
but
there
are
ways
of
getting
rid
of
frivolous
lawsuits.
the
point
also
is,
it's
hard...
if
you
see
an
increase,
justice
o'connor,
and
if
it
is
an
increase
that
gets
anywhere,
it
might
be
because
they
stopped
destroying
the
evidence,
because
they
stopped
fabricating...
they've
so
doctored
the
files,
like
the
file
in
this
case,
to
make
it
look
in
any
given
case
as
though
the
report
that
they
give
corresponds
to
the
history
of
the
case,
and
it's
awfully
hard
to
sue
successfully
when
the
file
has
been
massaged
and
doctored.
the
result
in
a
case
like
this
is
of
course
it
looks
like
a
very
large
award,
but--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
if
it
was
for
any
activity
that
occurred
during
the
period
from
may
1979
to
the
time
of
this
trial--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
i
think
that
it's
a
penalty
that
is
like...
there
ought
to
be
some
double
jeopardy
like
doctrine
that
if
they
can
show
that
they've
already
been
punished
for
this
course
of
conduct,
they
ought
not
to
have
to
pay
the
penalty
a
second
time.
now,
the
double
jeopardy
clause--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
would...
i
just
made
it
up.
[laughter]
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
just
made
it
up.
i
said
there
ought
to
be
such
a
doctrine.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes,
a
second--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
if
they
commit
50
big
offenses,
it's
part
of
our
jurisprudence
of
50
states
that
they
might
be
subject
to
50
penalties.
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right.
that's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
ultimately,
you
are.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
scalia,
there's
no
pretense
that
this
is
compensatory
damages.
the
compensatory
damage
compensates
them
for
the
harm
done
to
them.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
then
the
reprehensibility
of
what
was
done
to
them
is
affected
by,
as
this
court
has
said,
whether
it
was
an
isolated
event,
as
they
claimed,
or
whether
it
was
done
as
part
of
a
schematic,
systematic
form
of
predation.
now,
it
was
of
that
sort.
that
was
shown.
the
fact
that
it
was
predation
that
was
launched
from
bloomington
and
therefore
spread
throughout
the
country
is
state
farm's
problem.
it
shouldn't
be
the
problem
of
the
plaintiff
who
collects
punitive
damages
in
a
given
case.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
there
was
no
request
here,
as
there
was,
for
example,
in
the
recent
ninth
circuit
case
against
ford,
no
request
whatsoever
by
state
farm
for
such
an
instruction.
what
they
did
request,
and
were
not
entitled
to,
was
that
under
bmw
they
preserved
an
objection
that
the
out-of-state
evidence
be
completely
disregarded,
even
though
it
came
in
in
response
to
the
doors
that
they
had
opened,
but
they
did
not--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--not
at
all.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
and
they
were
fully
aware...
i
mean,
the
day
after
bmw
came
down,
there
was
a
bench
conference.
there
was
an
extended
colloquy.
it
was
fully--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
the...
may
21,
1996
was
before
the
full-blown
2-month
period
of
the
phase
2
trial.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
it
was
known
very
clearly
the
day
after
bmw
that
a
good
bit
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
because
many
of
the
examples
of
how
this
policy
worked,
would
come
from
other
places,
would
not
be
utah-based.
the
$100
million
verdict
which
would
illustrate
the
wall
they
built
would
come
from
texas.
they
never
once
asked
for
an
instruction
limiting
matters
to
utah,
and
i
don't
fault
them
for
it.
it
would
have
been
rather
bizarre
to
do
so,
because
they
knew
full
well
that
we
were
not
asking
the
utah
jury
or
the
utah
courts
to
punish
them
for
what
they
did
elsewhere.
we
were
simply
using
what
was
done
elsewhere
first
to
rebut
their
commissioners...
they
brought
in
commissioners
from
various
states
to
testify
that
state
farm
never
did
anything
wrong.
the
trial
court
said,
now
you
know,
if
you
do
that,
you're
going
to
open
the
door...
justice
stevens,
i
wanted
to
just...
if
you
do
that,
you're
going
to
open
the
door
to
proof
of
what
happened
elsewhere.
they
didn't
mind,
and
they
insisted
that
the
sequence
of
proof
be
rebuttal
first,
actually,
through
depositions,
and
then
the
principal
arguments,
which
made
it
look
as
though
it
was
part
of
the
direct
case.
i
think
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--this
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
