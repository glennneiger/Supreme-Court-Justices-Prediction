justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
ask
you
a
technical
question
about
the
local
rule?
i...
as
i
recall,
wherever
it
was
referred
to,
it
was
referred
to
not
as
rule,
but
as
order.
does
everybody
in
the
case
agree
that
whatever
this
order
was,
it
had
the
status
of
a
local
rule
for
purposes
of
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
you're
saying
that
that
jurisdiction
is
on
the
level,
as
i
think
you
are,
on
the
level
with
subject
matter
jurisdiction--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
it
seems
to
me
you've
proved
too
much,
because
if
it
were...
if
congress
were
assuming
it
was
on
that
level,
congress
wouldn't
have
done
this
in
the
first
place.
you
can't
consent
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
you
can't
consent
to
it
by
filing
written
forms
before
trial,
so
we've
got
to
make
the
assumption,
just
as
justice
ginsburg
did
in
her
question,
that
we're
dealing
with
an
interest
which
congress
viewed
at
a
very
lower
level.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
we...
i'll...
i'll
grant
you
that...
i
mean,
i
read
the
statute,
this...
and
the
rule
the
same
way
you
do.
of
course,
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
consent
beforehand,
and
i
think
you're
right,
consent
in...
in
written
form.
the
question
is,
if...
if
that
consent
is
not
given,
and
a
whole
trial
is
held,
did
congress
regard
the
subject
of
the
consent
as
being
on
the
same
level
as
subject
matter
jurisdiction
so
that
it
could
not
possibly
either
be
satisfied
by...
by
an...
an
inferred
consent
or
corrected
afterwards,
and
if
it
were
on
the
level
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
then
there
couldn't
have
been
consent
in
the
first
place,
so
we've
got
to
assume
that
congress
regarded
the
interest
here
as
something
less
significant
than,
say,
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
justice
david
h.
souter
who
do
you
suppose
was
intended
to
be
protected
by
these
congressional
requirements?
the
point
of
my
question
is,
wasn't
the
point
to
protect
people
who
didn't
want
to
be
tried
by
a
magistrate
judge,
and
if
that
is
the
answer,
why
is
someone
in
your
position,
or
your
client's
position,
in
a
position
to
object
at
all
here?
your
client
gave
consent.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
if...
if
we
say,
this
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
structural
problems,
which
is
what
we
were
getting
at--
justice
david
h.
souter
--earlier
when
we
were
saying,
well,
it
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
personal
jurisdiction,
so
if
we
say,
that's
not
really
involved
here,
then
it's
merely
a
personal
protection,
and
i
suppose
it's
a
personal
protection
for
the
purpose
who...
for
the
person
who
can
give
or
refuse
consent,
and
as
long
as
your
client
said,
fine
with
me
to
be
tried
by
a
magistrate
judge,
why
isn't
the
end
of
it,
that
the
end
of
it
for
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
saying
my
client
never
consented
that
they
could
get
by
without
giving
a
written
consent,
but
that...
i
mean,
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
turning
the
whole
premise
on
its
head.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
i
should
let
you
give
your
answer,
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
think
you're
answering
a
different
objection.
i
said,
why
isn't
your
consent
sufficient
so
that
once
you
give
it,
you
have
no
further
objection,
and
you
said,
the
answer
is,
i
didn't
consent
to
a
trial
in
which
they
can
sit
back
and
wait
and
see
what
happens
and
then
say,
oh,
we
didn't
consent,
rendering
the
entire
thing
a
waste
of
time.
justice
ginsburg
says,
yeah,
but
if
we
say,
they
don't
have
the
right
to
pull
their
consent
if
they
sat
there
and
implicitly
consented,
then
you
don't
have
that
problem
at
all,
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
argument,
and
i
don't
think
you've
answered
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
another
question,
too,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--your
answer
was,
i
consented,
so
far
as
i
was
concerned,
to
be
tried.
i
didn't
consent
to
give
them
an
option
to
go
through
an
entire
trial
and
then
pull
the
rug
out
if
they
didn't
like
the
result.
justice
ginsburg's
suggestion
and
my
suggestion
is,
if
we...
this.
if
we
find
that
an
implicit
consent
on
their
part
is
sufficient,
they
can't
pull
the
rug
out,
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
issue
so
far
as
self
protection
is
concerned,
and
i
don't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
don't
see
a
way
around
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
was
why
you
were
going
to
another
subject.
no,
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
i'd
do
it,
too.
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is...
don't
they
give
the
consent,
though,
when
the
magistrate
judge
sits
down
and
says,
let's
go,
and...
and
the...
i
realize
consent
is
not
failure
to
object.
there's
a
distinction
there,
but
if
the
party
sits
there
and
the
trial
begins--
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
magistrate
can
say
the
words,
let's
go...
i
mean,
he's
got
that
first
amendment
right,
and
if
he--
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
magistrate
does
say
that,
and
everybody
sits
there,
as
it
were,
with
a
smile
on
their
face,
i
would
suppose
that
that
was
a
consent
at
that
point.
i
mean,
isn't...
couldn't
you
infer
the
consent
at
that
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
use
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
section
636(c)(1)
of
the
federal
magistrate
act
of
1979
allows
fulltime
federal
magistrate
judges
to
conduct
civil
trials
as
long
as
the
magistrate
judge
is
designated
by
the
district
court
for
that
purpose
and
is
acting
upon
the
consent
of
the
parties.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
parties
consent
can
be
inferred
from
their
conduct
in
litigation.
a
state
prisoner,
the
respondent
here,
brought
an
action
against
members
of
the
prison’s
medical
staff
here,
the
petitioners,
alleging
that
they
had
been
indifferent
to
his
medical
needs.
early
on,
all
the
parties
were
told
of
a
need
to
file
a
form
showing
consent
to
proceed
before
the
magistrate
judge.
the
plaintiff-respondent
filed
the
consent
form
but
not
all
of
the
defendants
did.
instead,
the
defendants
simply
showed
up
before
the
magistrate
judge
for
the
purposes
of
litigating
the
case
and
never
made
any
objection
to
her
proceeding.
after
a
full
trial,
the
jury
found
for
the
defendants,
it
was
only
on
appeal
that
the
court
of
appeals
realized
that
consent
forms
had
not
been
formally
filed,
and
it
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
this
affected
the
magistrate
judge’s
authority
over
the
case.
the
district
court
found
that
the
defendants
had
implied
their
consent
to
the
magistrate
judge’s
authority
but
it
held
implied
consent
to
be
insufficient
under
the
act.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
we
hold
that
the
basic
premise
of
a
magistrate
judge’s
authority
on
the
636(c)(1)
is
the
voluntary
consent
of
the
parties
which
can
be
inferred
from
parties'
conduct
before
the
magistrate
judge.
we
have
two
principal
reasons
for
this
conclusion:
first,
the
text
of
636(c)(1)
which
is
the
source
of
the
magistrate
judge’s
authority
refers
only
to
the
consent
of
the
parties
without
any
qualification
as
to
the
form
of
consent.
it
is
true
that
the
usual
and
preferable
procedure
for
obtaining
consent
set
out
in
636(c)(2)
of
the
act
and
the
relevant
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
is
for
the
parties
to
file
written
consent
forms
with
the
clerk
of
court
prior
to
proceeding
before
the
magistrate
judge,
but
we
do
not
restrict
compliance
with
these
procedures
as
an
absolute
prerequisite
to
the
magistrate
judge’s
authority
under
636(c)(1).
there
is
another
more
pragmatic
reason
for
allowing
consent
to
be
inferred.
in
giving
the
magistrate
judge
authority
to
preside
over
civil
cases,
congress
was
trying
to
reduce
the
district
court’s
case
load
while
at
the
same
time
protecting
a
litigant’s
right
to
insist
on
a
district
judge
protected
by
article
iii.
while
recurring
re-litigation
in
the
absence
of
express
written
consent
would
give
maximum
protection
to
the
litigant’s
rights
to
an
article
iii
judge,
it
will
impose
a
significant
burden
on
judicial
resources
and
would
give
undeserving
parties
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
we
conclude
that
the
better
rule
is
to
accept
an
inference
of
consent
whereas
here
the
litigant
was
made
aware
of
the
need
for
consent
and
the
right
to
refuse
it
and
still
voluntarily
appeared
to
try
the
case
before
the
magistrate
judge.
we
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
scalia,
and
kennedy
join.
