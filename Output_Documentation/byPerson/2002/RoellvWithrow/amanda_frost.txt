ms.
amanda

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
all
parties
must
expressly
consent
before
a
magistrate
may
exercise
jurisdiction
under
section
636(c).
first
and
foremost,
this
is
because
the
text
of
the
magistrates
act
and
rule
73(b)
require
express
consent.
in
addition--
ms.
amanda
frost
--i'd
like
to--
ms.
amanda
frost
--the
word,
express,
is
not
there,
your
honor.
it
is
in
rule
73(b),
and
in
addition,
i'd
like
to
point
your
honor...
your
honor
to
some
of
the
provisions
of
636(c)
which
strongly
indicate
that
the
consent
must
be
expressed.
ms.
amanda
frost
73(b)
refers...
it
does
not
use
the
word
express,
your
honor.
ms.
amanda
frost
neither
use
the
term,
express.
rule
73(b)
refers
to
the...
that
the
parties
shall
execute
and
file
a
consent
form.
that
is
a
written
form
of
consent
that
obviously
must
be
express.
it
couldn't...
wouldn't
be
possible
to
file
in
writing
a
consent
without
that
being
express.
it
is
our
position
here
that
written
consent
is
required,
and
i
used
the
word
express
only
because
this
court
need
not
go
that
far
in
this
case,
because
these...
the
petitioners
here
not
only
failed
to
file
their
consent
in
writing,
as
73
requires,
but
they
also
failed
to
articulate
consent
at
all,
and...
and
so
there
is
no
need
to
reach
the...
the
question
of
whether
a
consent
must
be
in
writing.
ms.
amanda
frost
i...
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
for
example,
i
think
that
everything
that
these
petitioners
did
was
as
consistent
with
an
intent
to
withhold
consent
as
to
give
consent,
and
i'd
like
to
show
you
as
an
example
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
was
filed
in
this
case
that
petitioners
have
pointed
to
as
being
evidence
of
clear
consent.
it's
captioned,
to
the
honorable
judge
of
the
district
court,
and
it
was
submitted
to
the
clerk.
in
addition,
a
magistrate
may
review
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
under
636(b)
without
the
parties'
consent,
so
nothing
that
the
petitioners
did
by
submitting
this
motion
indicated
their...
their
intent
to
consent
to
these
proceedings.
ms.
amanda
frost
yes,
there
certainly
was,
your
honor.
ms.
amanda
frost
yes.
ms.
amanda
frost
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
petitioners'
argument,
and
the
reason
i
think
that
argument
cannot
be...
is
not
in
accord
with
the
language
of
the
magistrates
act
is,
first
of
all,
consent
is
used
consistently
throughout
the
act
to
be...
to
mean
an
express
statement.
for
example,
in
636(h),
a
retired
magistrate
may
come
out
of
retirement
and
serve
again
upon
the
consent
of
the...
of
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
court,
and
i
don't
think
even
petitioners
would
argue
that
that
consent
could
be
implied
in
the
sense
that
the
chief
judge
never
said
or
wrote
that
the
retired
judge--
ms.
amanda
frost
--well,
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor,
because
both
provisions,
636(h)
and
636(c)(1)
use
the
term,
upon
consent,
and
i
think
that
where
congress
used
the
same
term
throughout
the
statute,
it
should
be
interpreted
to
have
the
same
meaning,
but
that's
not
the
only
provision
i
rely
on.
there's
the
fact
that
the
congress
thought
consent
would
be
communicated
to
the
parties.
there's
the
fact
that
congress
said,
upon
consent,
meaning
consent
must
come
first.
it
makes
no
sense
to
say,
consent
must
come
first,
if
what
congress
meant
was,
simply
by
showing
up
once
the
magistrate
starts
exercising
that
authority,
we
are
going
to
consider
you
to
have
consented.
ms.
amanda
frost
justice
ginsburg,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
there
is
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
rule
12,
which
says
that
showing
up
will
be
waiving
your
right,
and
here
we
have
a
statute
that
requires
consent,
and
it's
important
to
look
at
why
congress
wanted
that.
congress
was
clearly
very
concerned
that
consent
be
voluntary,
willing,
and
knowing.
petitioners
agree,
and
the
question
is,
what
is
the
best
way
to
protect
that?
express
consent
protects
the
consent
and
ensures
that
it
is
voluntary.
ms.
amanda
frost
i
think
not,
your
honor,
for
a
few
reasons.
first
of
all,
there
is
nothing
that
would
have
stopped
these
parties
from...
from
arguing
after
the
fact
that
they
hadn't
intended
to
consent,
and
there's
no
evidence
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
the
counsel
failed
to
specifically
consent--
ms.
amanda
frost
--the
argument
they
would
make
is--
ms.
amanda
frost
--i
think
that
what
the
state
attorney
general
would
say
was,
i
had
not
realized
that
my...
i
had
not
realized
that
i
had
not
checked
with
my
clients,
that
i
had
not...
because
the
state
attorney
general
took
this
case
over,
he...
he
could
say,
i
had
not
realized
that
my
clients
had
not
already
agreed
to
do
this,
they
have
a
right
to
an
article
iii
judge.
ms.
amanda
frost
well,
i
think,
your
honor...
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
these
questions
go
to
the
question
of
whether
congress
intended
different
consent
standards
for
different
parties,
and
also
to
the
question
of
whether
congress
would
want
this
kind
of
satellite
litigation
on
the
question
of
consent.
i
think
it
is
telling
that
these...
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
when
asked
whether
they
consented,
said
they
could
not,
never
consented,
the
documents
they
submitted
to
the
district
court
were
captioned
to
the
district
court,
they
did
not
indicate
that
they
intended
to
go
before
a
magistrate.
would
congress
have
wanted
courts
to
have
to
deal
with
the
satellite
litigation
of
parties
arguing
whether
they
did
or
didn't
consent?
ms.
amanda
frost
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
true
in
this
case,
but
if
the
rule
is
explicit
consent
rather
than
inferred
consent,
and
if
that
is
established
as
the
rule,
then
there
will
be
far
fewer
occasions
on
which
mistakes
are
made.
ms.
amanda
frost
yes.
ms.
amanda
frost
well,
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
i
think
that,
both
throughout
the
magistrates
act
and
the
legislative
history,
congress
referred
to
section
636(c)
as
an
expansion
of
the
magistrate's
jurisdiction
to
act,
and
that
jurisdiction
can
only
be
invoked
upon
the
consent
of
the
parties.
ms.
amanda
frost
yes.
ms.
amanda
frost
i
respectfully
disagree,
justice
souter,
and
here's
why.
it's
not
a
question
of
consenting
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
it's
a
question
of
what
did
congress
say
are
the
limits
of
the
magistrate's--
ms.
amanda
frost
--i
would
not
put
it
quite
in
those
terms,
in
terms
of
less
significant.
i
think
what
congress
did
was
establish
thresholds
to
the
magistrate's
exercise
of
jurisdiction,
and
this
is
separate
and
apart
from
saying
this
is
a
federal
question
case.
of
course,
we
agree
with
that.
this
case
was
properly
in
federal
court.
the
question
is,
were
the
two
prerequisites
to
the
magistrate's
exercise
of
authority
met?
one
is
the
designation
by
the
district
court,
and
the
other
is
consent.
ms.
amanda
frost
first
notice...
that's,
i
think,
a
question
that's...
it's
arguable,
but
i
would
think
that
the
argument
would
be
that
no,
the
client
at
that
point
is
bound
by
the
attorney's
representation,
just
as
clients
are
bound
by
their
attorney's
representations
in
many
other
situations.
ms.
amanda
frost
i...
i
think
the...
it's
arguable,
but
the
answer
i
think
is
no,
because
there
are
many
very
important
decisions
that
counsel...
they're
supposed
to
consult
with
their
client
and,
indeed,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
rules
of
professional
responsibility
if
they
didn't
in
this
instance
on
this
question
of
consent,
but
if
for
some
reason
the
counsel
made
an
error,
frequently
litigants
are
at
the
mercy
of
their
counsel.
ms.
amanda
frost
yes,
well,
justice
breyer,
the
first
response
to
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine
is
that
that
is
supposed
to
apply
to
minor
errors,
and--
ms.
amanda
frost
--and--
ms.
amanda
frost
--i
was
going
to
say,
it's
not
that
important
considering
the
fact
that
they
expressly
consented
after
the
fact
of
the
trial,
but
that,
of
course,
cannot
be
what
this
court
relies
on,
or--
ms.
amanda
frost
--justice
breyer,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
first
that
congress
created
it
as
a
jurisdictional
threshold,
second,
that
congress
was
very
aware
of
the
constitutional
issues
that
arise
when
you
delegate
article
iii
powers
to
non-article
iii
actors,
and
for
that
reason,
congress
repeatedly
stated
it
wanted
consent
to
be
voluntary,
knowing,
and
willing.
it
was
concerned
that
less-advantaged
litigants
might
be
coerced,
or
might
not
realize
that
they
have
a
right
to
an
article
iii
judge.
for
this
reason,
congress--
ms.
amanda
frost
--uh-huh.
ms.
amanda
frost
i
think
that
would
not
be
sufficient,
your
honor,
because
it
would
change
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
in
addition
it
would...
the
question
would
have
to
arise,
what
would
happen
if
the
attorney
general
came
in
at
the
end
of
this
process
and
said,
i
didn't
consent,
and
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
strong
basis
on
this
record
for
the
attorney
general
to
proceed
on
that
argument
successfully.
the
rule
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
attorney
general
was
supposed
to
be
familiar
with
was
that
all
the
parties
must
submit
written
consent
before
trial,
so
the
fact
that
they
didn't
would
be
strong
evidence
they
had
not
intended
to
consent.
then
you
have
the
fact
that
all
their
pleadings
are
captioned
to
the
district
court,
you
have
the
fact
that
there
was
some
switching
off
of
counsel
so
it's
not
clear
whether
the
individuals,
individual
defendants
here
had
ever
been
consulted,
or
ever
had
an
opportunity
to
object.
ms.
amanda
frost
i
do
not
know
the
customary
way
that
pleadings
are
captioned.
i
do
know
that,
from
looking
through
the
record
in
this
case,
that
later
pleadings,
once
the
issue
had
come
up
that
the
magistrate...
that
there
was
never
explicit
consent
before
the
trial,
and
later
pleadings
did
not
have
that
caption,
so
it
had
been
taken
out,
and
i
guess
my
point
in--
ms.
amanda
frost
--nothing.
there
was...
there
was
not
in...
in
the
summary
judgment
motion
that
i
appealed
there
is
in
all
caps,
a
line
that
says,
to
the
honorable
judge
of
the
district
court,
and
in
the
later
pleadings
that
line
was
simply
removed.
there
was
nothing
there.
but
my
point,
your
honor,
is
not...
yes,
that
may
have
been
a
form
caption.
i
don't
dispute
that.
my
point
is
that
there
is
nothing,
from
their
submitting
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
that
indicates
their
consent.
ms.
amanda
frost
this
court's
decision
in
the
caterpillar
case
held
that
as
long
as
there
is
the...
as
long
as
diversity
is
met
at
the
time
of
the
entry
of
judgment,
then
that
is
acceptable,
but
that
isn't
your
hypothetical.
ms.
amanda
frost
the
district
court,
the
lower
court's
judgment.
ms.
amanda
frost
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
amanda
frost
no.
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
justice
souter.
the
first
is
that
there
are
both
structural
protections
and
personal
protections
in
the
consent
requirement.
as
this
court
said
in
cftc
v.
schor,
when
congress
requires
consent,
or
when
consent
is
required,
that
serves
as
a
break
on
the
delegation
of
article
iii
authority,
and
that
preserves
the
separation
of
powers
required
by
the
constitution.
ms.
amanda
frost
yes.
ms.
amanda
frost
because
my
client
never
consented
to
what
happened
here,
which
is
that
the
attorney
general,
by
failing
to
consent--
ms.
amanda
frost
--i
have
a
slightly
different
point
i'm
trying
to
make,
justice
souter,
which
is--
ms.
amanda
frost
--which
is
that
at
the
end
of
this
proceeding,
if
the
attorney
general's
office
had
said,
oh,
we
made
a...
we
didn't
mean
to
consent,
we're
not
filing
a
written
consent
form,
and
we
can't
consent
here,
then
there
would
have
been
a
new
trial,
and
of
course
they
were
only
going
to
do
that
if
they
lost
at
trial,
so
when
i
said
my
client
didn't
consent,
my
point
was,
my
client
didn't
consent
to
go
through
a
proceeding
where
his
adversary
had
the
opportunity
to
decide
at
the
end
of
the
case
whether
they--
ms.
amanda
frost
--i
disagree,
your
honor,
and
here's
why,
because
the
magistrates
act
establishes
consent
as
one
of
the
vital
thresholds
to
the
parties,
to
the
magistrate's
exercise
of
authority,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
the
provision
that
you're
reading
from
would
apply
in
a
situation
where
congress
said,
before
a
magistrate
can
take
over
that
article
iii
authority
there
must
be
both
designation
and
consent.
i
think
if...
if
the
district
court
here
had
not
designated
this
magistrate,
that
is
also
an
error
that
could
not
be
overlooked.
ms.
amanda
frost
yes,
i
agree,
and
let
me
answer...
you're
very
right,
justice
souter,
and
let
me
answer
the
question
that
i
think
you
both
are
posing,
which
is,
could
a
harmless
error
standard
be
applied
here?
in
other
words,
if
it
is
true
that
the
only
right
is
my
client's,
and--
ms.
amanda
frost
--oh,
i
saw
them
as
related,
because
i...
if
i
understood
your
question
correctly,
what
i
thought
you
were
asking
was--
ms.
amanda
frost
--i
agree.
ms.
amanda
frost
yes,
i...
i
was...
i
agree
with
your
honor,
and
that
was
why
i
was
turning
to
the
question--
ms.
amanda
frost
--well,
respectfully,
your
honor,
i
think
this
is
related,
because
what
i
was
trying
to
say
is
that
while
i
agree
with
you
that
once
you
say,
if
these
people
go
forward
at
trial,
they're
stuck,
then
there
is
no
question
about,
did
my
client
get
a
raw
deal
here,
because
everyone's
bound,
and
they
would
have
been
bound
if
they
had
lost,
so
that
is
why
i
am
going
on
to
the
next
argument,
which
is
harmless
error,
and
whether
or
not
that
would
legitimately
be
something
that
a
court
could
apply
in
this
situation,
and
this
court
has
said,
in
both
it's
magistrate
judge
jurisprudence
and
also
in
its
article
iii
jurisprudence--
ms.
amanda
frost
--yes,
and
i
think
that--
ms.
amanda
frost
--exactly,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
amanda
frost
that
is
my
argument,
justice
stevens,
which
is
that
because
the
statute
says
upon
consent,
the
consent
must
come
first,
and
therefore
simply
by--
ms.
amanda
frost
--i
agree
that
consent
could
be
inferred
at
that
point,
but
i
would
disagree
strongly
that
congress
intended
inaction
to
equal
consent.
ms.
amanda
frost
yes,
exactly.
i
agreed
that
consent
could
be
inferred
from
the
parties'
conduct,
but
that
does
not
meet
the
requirement
of
the
statute.
ms.
amanda
frost
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
but
then
the
question
is,
well,
did
congress
intend
for
some
different
standard
for
consent
to
be
applied
in
different
cases?
the
congress--
ms.
amanda
frost
--yes,
i
agree
with
that,
justice
kennedy,
and
that
would
be
another
reason
to
say
yes,
congress'
concerns
actually
do
apply
to
the
state
attorney
generals,
but
in
any
case
i
think
that
what's
relevant
here
as
well
is
the
fact
that
congress
clearly...
and
it
couldn't
be
more
clear,
both
from
the
use
of
the
word
jurisdiction
in
the
statute,
and
from
the
fact
that
in
the
legislative
history
congress
expressed
these
concerns
about
voluntariness,
that
consent
must
be
expressed.
the
counsel
for
the
petitioners,
when
she
was
arguing,
repeatedly
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
local
rules
and
rule
73(b)
protect
the
voluntariness
concerns.
they
serve
that
purpose,
and
that
is
our
point.
that
is
what
congress
said
consent
is
for,
and
that
is
why
congress
said
consent
cannot
be
something
that
simply
is
implied
as
you
go
along.
consent
must
be
something
you
communicate
to
the
clerk.
it
must
be
something
clear,
and
that
is
why
eight
courts
of
appeals,
we
respectfully
submit,
have
already
reached
the
conclusion
there
must
be
express
consent.
they've
reached
the
conclusion
that
without
it,
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction,
and
both...
and
all
of
these
decisions
came
before
amendments
to
the
magistrates
act
in
1990,
in
'96.
if
congress
had
an
issue
with
both
the
consent
requirement
being
read
as
express
consent
and
with
courts
concluding
they
had
no
jurisdiction
without
it,
then
congress
could
have
take
action,
taken
action,
and
because
it
didn't,
i
believe
that
that
is
a
sign
that
congress
meant
what
it
said
in
the
magistrates
act.
