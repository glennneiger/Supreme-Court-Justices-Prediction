chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
02-69,
joseph
roell,
petra
garibay,
and
james
reagan
versus
john
michael
withrow.
ms.
eskow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
rule
73(b)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
can...
can
local
rules
in
one
district
produce
a
different
result
than
another
district
which
didn't
have
that
local
review
with
respect
to
this
sort
of
consent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
basically
this
isn't
jurisdictional
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
want
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
your
time,
ms.
eskow?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
frost,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
part
of
73(b)
uses
the
word
express?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
neither
the
statute
nor
the
rule
use
the
term
express,
as
you
suggested
earlier.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wasn't
there
a
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they...
they
did
participate
in
the
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
even
if
filing
that
motion
did
not
give
implied
consent,
perhaps
it
could
be
argued
that
simply
participating
in
the
trial
gave
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
used
in
a
little
bit
different
sense
there.
it
requires
basically
the
permission
of
the
chief
judge,
which
you
know,
i
think
you're
quite
right
in
saying
that
that
would
not
be
satisfied
by
simply
doing
nothing,
but
in...
in
a
case
where
you're
talking
about
an
agreement,
i...
i
think
it's...
the
law
is
different
in
some...
in
some
respects.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it...
i
mean,
who...
who
is
the
attorney
general's
client
except
state
officials?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
630...
636(c),
as
you
point
out,
talks
about
the
consent
of
the
parties.
now,
supposing
an
attorney
for
a
party
comes
in,
signs
a
consent
form,
and
then
the...
he
loses
the
case.
can
the
client
later
come
in
and
say,
i
never
authorized
the
attorney
to
sign
that
consent
form?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
aren't
bound
by
their
attorney's
representations
in
some
criminal
cases.
i
mean,
the...
the
client
must
make
the
decision.
you
don't
think
this
is
one
of
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
customary
way
in
the
southern
district
of
texas
to
caption
a
pleading,
before
the
magistrate
judge,
if
the
magistrate
judge
is
presiding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
later
pleadings
have?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
frost.
ms.
eskow,
you
have
3
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
eskow.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-69,
roell
against
withrow
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
