justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
like
double
jeopardy
when
this
first
witness
is
sworn,
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
suggested
earlier
that
the
second
sentence
of...
of
(c)...
of
(c)(1)
contains
the
written...
the
writing
request,
whereas
the
first
second...
sentence
doesn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
writing
request
in
the
second
sentence
is
a
request
for
the...
the
magistrate
to
participate,
rather
than
the
consent
itself.
it
says,
upon
the
consent
of
the
parties
pursuant
to
this
specific
written
request.
there's
no
requirement
of
writing
with
respect
to
the
request
in
the
first
sentence,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
disavow
the
need
for
writing
in
the...
to
evidence
the
consent
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right,
but
there
doesn't
have
to
be
a
written
request
with
respect
to
the
first
sentence.
there
just
has
to
be...
if
one
reads
it
the
other...
the
way
your
opponent
does
it,
there
just
has
to
be
a
writing
evidencing
the
consent
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
expressed.
i'm
saying,
that's
not
expressed,
but
i'm
just
saying
that
it's
not...
it's
not...
the
two...
the
writing
requirement
that
is
referred
to
in
the
second
sentence
is
not
an
exact
parallel
of
what
they
contend
the...
the
writing
requirement
is
in
the
first
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
that's
the
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
that's
the
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
make
one...
ask
you
one
clarifying
question
for
me?
is
it
your
position
that
it...
it
is
not
necessary
either
to
consent
in
advance,
or
to
have
the
consent
in
writing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
wasn't
there
a
finding
that
that
did
not
occur
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statutory
provision
that
you...
that
you
cited,
which
provides
for
subsequent
discussions,
is
predicated
on
the
fact
that
consent
has
first
been
communicated
to
the
clerk
of
the
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
congress
basically
talked
about
this
discussion
process
against
the
backdrop
of
a
consent
form
that
had
already
been
communicated
to
the
clerk.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
once
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
with
this
question?
if
you
took
justice
ginsburg's
suggestion
that
just
participation
in
the
trial
is
enough
to
establish
the
consent,
that
would
mean
that
the
consent
need
not
be
given
in
advance
of
the
beginning
of
the
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
statute's
rather
clear
that
it
has
to
come
first,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
may
i
ask,
does
he
even
have
the
authority
to
say,
let's
go,
before
consent
has
been
given?
