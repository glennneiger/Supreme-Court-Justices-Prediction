ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
parties
knowingly
and
voluntarily
proceed
to
trial
before
a
magistrate
judge,
they
consent
within
the
meaning
of
28
u.s.c.
section
636(c)(1).
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
confers
case-dispositive
authority
on
full-time
magistrate
judges
upon
the
consent
of
the
parties.
congress
did
not
specify
in
section
636
what
form
that
consent
should
take.
it
did
not
include
adjectives
such
as
express
or
written,
and
the
omission
of
such
qualifiers
is
significant.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
yes,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
rule
73
does
require
that
the
parties
execute
a
consent
form
filed
with
the
court,
and
it
did
not
occur
in
this
case.
however,
a
violation
of
that
rule
did
not
divest
the
magistrate
judge
of
authority
to
preside
over
the
case,
and
that
is
because
the
authority
emanates
from
the
statute,
specifically
the
requirement
that
the
consent
be
voluntary
in
636(c)(1),
and
although
it
was
error
not
to
follow
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
or
the
local
rules
for
the
southern
district
of
texas,
which
may
have
had
writing
requirements,
these
rules
were
related
to
procedural
safeguards
to
protect
the
voluntariness
of
the
parties.
they
are
not
the
consent
requirement
themselves,
and
it
is
the
voluntariness
of
the
agreement
that
gives
a
magistrate
judge
authority
to
preside,
not
compliance
with
technicalities
of
statutory
referral
procedures.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
yes,
justice
stevens,
we
do.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
any
case-dispositive
actions
under
section
636(c)--
yes.
--yes,
that
would
have
to
be
with
the
consent
of
the
parties.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
yes.
yes,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
well,
certainly,
consent
in
our
view
is
predicated
on
two
things,
and
first
it's
notice
that
the
magistrate
judge
is
proceeding
in
this
case-dispositive
authority,
and
notice
that
the
party
has
an
opportunity
to
decline
to
consent
to
that
procedure.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
certainly,
that
would
be
a
signal,
and
yes,
if
a
party
did
not
object
at
that
point,
after
being
on
notice
that
the
magistrate
judge
was
exercising
case-dispositive
authority.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
the--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--we
would
respectfully
disagree,
justice
kennedy.
absolutely,
the
rule
is
designed
to
protect
the
voluntariness
of
the
parties'
consent
and
to
ensure
that
they
aren't
coerced
into
agreeing
to
a
procedure
and
into
relinquishing
their
right
to
an
article
iii
judge
when
it's
not
something
that
they
voluntarily
choose
to
do,
but
those
are
merely
the
procedures
to
protect
the
consent.
the
consent
itself
is
the
predicate
for
the
exercise
of
the
authority,
and
although
there
was
a
departure
from
the
local
rules,
and
in
this
instance,
it
was
not
merely
on
the
part
of
two
defendants
who
neglected
to
file
a
form
but
on
the
part
of
plaintiff
withrow,
who
neglected
to
obtain
all
parties'
consent,
as
was
his
responsibility
under
the
local
rules--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--no,
justice
ginsburg.
he...
he
was
pro...
he
was
pro
se
at
that
time.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
no,
justice
kennedy.
certainly,
that
was
just
an
indication
of
the
various
mishaps
that
can
happen
because
of
the
nature
of
the
varying
local
requirements
that
exist
in
different
districts.
you
also
had
in
this
instance
a
district
judge
who
referred
the
case
to
the
magistrate
before
the
defendants
had
even
been
served,
much
less
had
an
opportunity
to
consent,
and
the
magistrate
judge
did
not
comply
with
local
practice
of
confirming
on
the
record
all
parties'
consent--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--absolutely
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
in...
in
this
circumstance,
certainly
that
authority
emanates
from
the
statute
itself,
and
a
local
rule
can't
determine
the
authority
of
the
magistrate
judge.
that
would
apply
nationally,
and
in
every
court,
but--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--yes,
before
even
the
case
could
be
referred
the
local
requirement
existed,
but
that
was
departed
from
both
by
the
clerk,
who
provided
a
form
to
the
district
judge
before
it
had
been
signed
by
the
parties,
and
by
the
district
judge
himself,
who
referred
the
case
without
waiting
for
all
parties'
consent,
or
even
all
parties'
service.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
absolutely.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
that
was
at
a
preliminary
proceeding,
justice
ginsburg,
a
spears
hearing,
that
was
determine
whether
or
not
plaintiff
withrow's
claim
should
even
be
permitted
to
proceed,
or
whether
he
should
be
permitted
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
and
whether
service
would
be
affected.
no
defendant
had
been
served
at
that
point.
it
was
an
evaluation
under
section
1915(a)
of
whether
this
prisoner
suit
should
be
allowed
to
proceed,
and
at
that
time
there
was
a
representative
of
the
attorney
general's
office
present
at
the
hearing,
merely
in
an
informational
capacity,
but
none
of
the
defendants
had
been
served,
and
they
were
not
yet
represented,
so
she
indicated
at
that
hearing
that
she
could
not
consent
on
their
behalf.
later
on,
after
that
hearing,
when
it
was
determined
that
some
claims
could
proceed,
there
was
service
on
the
defendants,
and
that
was
effected
on
a
different
attorney
general,
who
in
turn
assigned
it
to
the
attorney
general...
the
assistant
attorney
general
who
did
represent
the
defendants
at
trial
and
filed
answers
on
their
behalf,
and...
and
that
attorney
did
neglect
to
file
the
required
forms.
however,
at
the
time
of
service,
the
case
had
already
been
referred,
and
he
did
not
go
back
to
confirm
whether
previously
the
forms
were
on
file,
but
everyone
in
this
proceeding
was
assuming
that
all
the
parties
consented
because
the
case
was
already
before
the
magistrate
judge,
and
everyone
was
acting
in
accordance
with
a
section
636(c)(1)
referral.
indeed,
in
the
referral
order
that
the
district
judge
signed
that
sent
the
case
to
the
magistrate
judge,
it
specified
that
if
the
defendants
did
not
consent,
they
merely
needed
to
indicate
that
to
the
court
and
it
would
go
back
to
the
district
judge,
so
certainly
there
was
an
awareness
that
the
case
was
proceeding
pursuant
to
the
dispositive,
case-dispositive
provisions
in
subsection
(c).
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
yes,
who
was
represented
by
separate
counsel,
and
that
counsel
did
follow
the
instructions
from
the
court
and...
and
did
comply,
and
that
was
not
complied
with
by
the
attorney
who
was
representing
the
two
defendants
at
trial
in
this
case,
but
everything
that
that
attorney
did
was
consistent
with
and
demonstrated
the
parties'
consent
in
this
instance,
including
filing
a
dispositive
motion
with
the...
the
court
that
the
magistrate
judge
could
grant
only
if
she
had
authority
under
subsection
(c),
and
only
if
she
had
the
parties'
consent,
and
when
she
denied
that
motion
and
made
that
adverse
ruling,
that
she
could
only
do
with
the
parties'
consent,
these
defendants
never
once
objected,
they
did
not
dispute
that
they
consented,
instead,
they
asked
her
to
reconsider
the
merits
of
their
summary
judgment
motion.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
certainly,
communicated
to...
to
the
clerk
suggests
that...
that
the
clerk
will
be
informed
of
the
decision.
when
the
parties
filed
a
dispositive
motion
that
invoked,
affirmatively
invoked
the
case-dispositive
authority,
that
was
before
the
clerk
and
would
have
notified
the
clerk
that
they
were--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--it
would,
and
moreover,
it's
subsection
(1)
that
discusses
the
authority
of
the
magistrate
judge--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--and
speaks
only
of
consent
that
is
the
provision
of
the
statute
in
which
congress
gave
this
grant
of
authority.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
subsection
(2)
is
a
procedural
mechanism
for
ensuring
the
voluntariness,
the
requirement
under
subsection
(1).
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
with
subsection--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--subsection
(2),
in
this
instance,
no.
because
of
the
local
procedures
that
are
requested
the
district
courts
develop
under
subsection
(2),
they
were
not
complied
with
by
any
of
the
parties
or
any
of
the
judges
in
this
case,
so
there
was
a
departure,
but
because
there
was
full
compliance
of
subsection
(1),
in
that
the
parties
all
voluntarily
agreed,
absolutely
there
was
authority
to
proceed.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
yes,
justice
souter.
that
is
not
disputed
by
any
of
the
parties.
that
is
just
the
mechanism
by
which
the
southern
district
of
texas
implemented
it
as
a
general
order.
it
is
printed
in
writing,
it
is
signed
by
the
judges
of
the
court,
the
chief
judge
of
the
court,
and
it's
something
that
is
respected
by
all
parties
as
being
the
local
rule
in
that
case.
congress'
intent
not
to
require
any
specified
form
of
consent
is
evidenced
by
the
language
in
(c)(1)
itself,
where
the
first
provision
is...
for
full-time
magistrate
judges
does
not
require
any
form
of
written
consent,
it
merely
speaks
to
consent.
in
the
very
next
sentence
of
the
statute,
which
is
on
page
3a
of
the
appendix
in
the
petitioners'
brief
on
the
merits,
the
statute
specifies
that
for
part-time
magistrate
judges,
there
has
to
be
a
specific
written
request
by
the
parties
in
order
for
the
magistrate
judge
to
exercise
case-dispositive
authority,
and
the
fact
that
congress
in
the
very
next
sentence
chose
to
insert
and
to
require
a
written
consent
indicates
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
make
the
same
sort
of
requirement
with
respect
to
full-time
magistrate
judges,
because
that
adjective
is...
is
lacking,
and
the
court
should
not
engraft
terms
onto
the
statute
that
congress
chose
not
to
include.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
an
inferred
consent
rule
and...
and
determine
consent
based
on
the
parties'
voluntary
conduct
beforehand,
and
there
was
notice,
and
there
was
a
clear
indication
of
conforming
to
636(c)--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--in
this
case?
yes,
my
understanding
is
that
no
party
had...
had
even
thought,
it
had
not
crossed
any
party's
mind
that
consent
was
lacking
and
that
all
parties
were
intending
to
be
bound
by
the
judgment.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
that
is
the...
the
correct
approach.
certainly,
in
the
seventh
and
eleventh
circuits,
where
those
courts
require
express
post
judgment
consent
separate
and
apart
from
looking
at
the
underlying
conduct,
in
those
situations
there
is
not
an
effective
judgment
if
the
parties
refuse
to
put
express
consent
on
the
record
after
the
fact.
that
is
certainly
one
approach
to
the
statute.
it's
one
approach
that
we
believe
is
valid,
because
requiring
that
express
consent
at
some
point
in
the
proceedings
to
confirm
the
earlier
conduct
is
something
that...
that
would
protect
the
voluntariness
concerns
congress
had,
but
we
don't
believe
that
it's
required
in...
in
terms
of
the
authority,
that
the
authority
comes
from
the
voluntary
agreement
that's
evidenced
from
how
the
parties
proceeded,
and
certainly,
if
the
court
wished
to
avoid
the
gaming
concerns
that
the
fifth
circuit
expressed
under
the
type
of
post
judgment
consent
rule
that
the
seventh
and
eleventh
circuits
adopted,
then
adopting
an
inferred
consent
rule
would
eliminate
that
by
requiring
parties
to
be
bound
by
the
bargain
they
struck.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
yes,
justice
o'connor,
that's
absolutely
true,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
makes
that
requirement.
indeed,
another
provision
of
the
federal
magistrates
act,
the
provision
governing
misdemeanor
trial
authority,
that's
in
18
u.s.c.
section
3401(b),
requires
not...
it
used
to
require
written
consent.
in
1996,
congress
amended
the
act
to
require
only
oral
consent,
but
it
specified
that
it
could
be
oral
or
written,
but
that
it
needed
to
be
express.
the
words,
expressly
consents,
are
in
that
provision,
and
certainly
neither
the
word
express,
nor
the
word
oral
or
written,
exist
in
636(c)(1).
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
yes.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
we
would
read
the
statute
differently,
justice
stevens,
that
the
fact
that
it
says,
upon
the
consent
of
the
parties
pursuant
to
their
specific
request,
would
indicate
that
the
consent
of
the
parties
has
to
be
pursuant
to
their
written
request.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
we
would
respectfully
disagree.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
that
the
writing
requirement
only
exists
with
respect
to
the
part-time
magistrate
judge,
and
that
that
goes
to
the
consent
as
well.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
well,
certainly
respondent
has
a
variety
of
writing
requirements,
and
one
that
they
deem
to
be
dictated
by
the
local
rules
as
well,
which
is
something
that's
not
spoken
to
in
subsection
(c)(1).
certainly,
the...
the
statute
in
(c)(1)
imposes
no
sort
of
express
or
written
requirement
with
respect
to
consent
or
with
respect
to
requesting
a
magistrate
judge--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--in
any
form.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
and
the
absence
of
that
we
believe
is
significant
because...
in
these
other
provisions
because
in
the
misdemeanor
trial
authority,
it
requires
consent,
and
is
probably
the
closest
analogy
to
the
trial
authority
in
subsection
(c)(1).
there
is
both
express
consent
required,
and
it
specifies
that
it
can
be
oral
or
written.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
certainly,
congress
is
aware
of
the
common
sense
meaning
of
consent,
and
in
substance--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--we
don't
believe
it's
obvious,
justice
breyer,
because
if
it
was
the
form
of
the
local
rules,
or
the
form
of
consent
prescribed
by
local
rules
that
determined
the
authority,
you
would
have
magistrate
judges
with
different
authority
in
a
variety
of
jurisdictions
across
the
country.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
certainly
it
may
be
a
good
idea
as
a
matter
of
policy--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--to
require.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
certainly,
our
view
is
that
because
congress
specified
the
requirements
for
local
rules
in
a
separate
subsection
than
the
consent
requirement
itself,
it
was
anticipating
that
there
would
be
some
need
to
protect
the
voluntariness,
but
that
it
is
the
voluntariness
that's
the
cornerstone,
and
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
administrative
discretion
on
the
local
level.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
yes.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
that
certainly
is
the
question.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
the...
yes,
absolutely.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
because
the
underlying
voluntary
consent
is
there
through
the
parties'
conduct,
and
to
the
extent
the
court
construes
the
statute--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--well,
certainly--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--assuming
there
is
a
violation
of...
of
the
rule,
and
that
their
consent
is
not
lacking,
the
question
is,
what
is
the
consequence
for
noncompliance
with
the
rule,
and
certainly
the
failure
to
comply
with
these
procedures,
for
that
to
be
an
automatic
grounds
for
reversal
would
be
a
deviation
from
accepted
practice,
which
is
a
party
has
to
object
to
a
proceeding,
has
to
preserve
error,
and
here,
no
party
objected,
and
it
is
their
personal
right
to
the
article
iii
judge.
it
is
their
personal
consent--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--that
is
at
stake.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
well,
certainly,
if
congress
had
not
provided
for
a
scheme
that
existed,
and
the
parties
randomly
invoked
the
authority
of
a
person
on
the
street,
that
would
be
a
problem,
but
here,
you
have
a
magistrate
judge
who
has
been
specifically
assigned
by
congress
to
perform
this
function
and
has
been
designated
by
the
district
judge
of
the
court,
and
the
only
question
is,
have
the
parties
agreed,
and
if...
and
if
no
party
objects
to
that
and
the
magistrate
judge
enters
the
final
judgment,
even
if
there's
been
noncompliance
with
the
rules,
the
question
is,
what
is
the
harm,
and
even--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--no.
no,
your
honor,
absolutely
not.
it's
not
a
question
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
term,
jurisdiction,
solely
is
a
question
of
authority
of
the
powers
of
the
magistrate
judge
to
act.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
it's
more--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--absolutely.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
and
that
it
can
be
waived
inadvertently,
even
by
failing
to
timely
assert
the
person--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--well,
certainly
in
peretz
versus
united
states
this
court
considered
a
circumstance
where,
in
a
felony
trial,
a
magistrate
judge
was
supervising
the
voir
dire,
and
the
defendant's
counsel
did
not
make
any
objection
to
that
when
it
went
on,
and
this
court
determined,
both
from
a
personal
litigant
article
iii
perspective,
as
well
as
from
a
structural
perspective,
that
there
was
no
infirmity
in
that
procedure,
and
that
a
defendant
who
does
not
assert
his
right
to
an
article
iii
judge
has
no
cognizable
right
that
he
can
enforce,
and
that
would
be
the
same
circumstance
here,
for
the
same
reasons
why
the
felony
voir
dire
was
permissible
without
objection
of
the
defendant
in
peretz
versus
united
states.
here,
without
objection
from
the
parties,
with
their
fully
informed
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
proceedings,
and
their
proceeding
through
judgment
affirmatively
invoking
the
authority
of
the
judge,
it
is
directly
parallel
to
the
situation
in
peretz
versus
united
states,
and
certainly
the
litigants
waived
their
personal
article
iii
right
to
a
district
judge,
and
the
same
structural
protections
that
this
court
deemed
sufficient
in
peretz
also
would
exist
here,
because
the
magistrate
judge
is
appointed,
or
direct...
referred
the
case
only
by
the
district
judge,
the
district
judge
can
at
any
point
in
time,
sua
sponte,
for
good
cause,
take
the
referral
back
from
the
magistrate
judge,
and...
and
supervises
the
process.
that
insulates
it
from
separations
of
powers
concerns
that--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--no,
your
honor.
we...
in
this
instance,
certainly
if
the
parties
are
voluntarily
proceeding
with
knowledge,
a
magistrate
judge
would
be
aware
that
they
were
going
forward
and
that
there
are
rules
that
inferred
consent
is
what
satisfies
the
statute,
then
yes,
a
magistrate
judge
would
know
when
a
party,
upon
notice
both
of
their
right
to
object
and
of
the
nature
of
proceeding,
invoked
the
affirmative
authority,
yes,
the
magistrate
judge
at
that
time
would
know
that
the
parties
have
made
the
dissent.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
well,
certainly
in
many
circumstances
the...
the
local
rules
do
provide
for
the
communication
to
the
clerk,
and
that
is
what
rule
73
provides.
as
a
matter
of
practice,
however,
in
1990,
congress
relaxed
the
consent
provisions
to
permit
discussions
between
the
district
judge
and
the
magistrate
judge
about
consent,
that
they
could
remind
the
parties
that
they
could
consent
to
a
magistrate
judge,
and
that
that
was
a
topic
that
could
be
discussed
in...
in
the
courtroom
provided
that
there
was
no
coercion
to
consent.
if--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--in
1990,
congress
amended
subsection
(c)(2)
to
loosen
the
consent
requirements,
and
certainly
it
still
anticipated
that
the
decision
is
going
to
go
to
the
clerk
of
court,
but
magistrate
judges
and
district
judges
are
not
prohibited
from
discussing
the
matter
of
a
referral
with
the
parties,
and
if
a
party
failed
to
sign
the
requisite
form,
certainly
there'd
be
no...
no
prejudice
by
proceeding
to
inform
the
judge
at
the
time
that
the
issue
came
up
that
they
did
consent,
and
certainly,
to...
to
wait
until
the
eve
of
trial,
when
every
indication
was
that
they
had
consented,
and
to
withdraw
it
at
that
point,
an
inferred
consent
rule
would
be
more
consistent
with
holding
the
parties
to
the
benefit
of
their
bargain.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
no,
justice
stevens.
we
believe
that
you
do
have
to
consent.
you
have
to
voluntarily
agree
before
the
magistrate
judge
can
act.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
no,
your
honor,
the...
only
a
finding
that
they
did
not
expressly
consent.
the
magistrate
judge
expressed...
actually
did
find
that
they
clearly
had
implied
their
consent
by
their
conduct,
but
deemed
implied
consent
insufficient.
the
only
piece
that
was
missing
was
an
express
memorialization
of
the
voluntary
agreement
that
did
exist.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
well--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--we
would
disagree,
justice
kennedy.
the
legislative
history
actually
indicates
that
the...
the
provision
was
intended
to
enable
the
district
judge
and
the
magistrate
judges
to
inform--
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
--to
inform
the
parties
of
the
availability,
irrespective
of
whether
they
had
actually
already
consented,
because
too
many
magistrate
judges
and
district
judges
believed
that
they...
they
could
not
go
on
record.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
thank
you.
ms.
lisa
r.
eskow
because
the
statute
was
designed
to
protect
the
voluntariness
of
the
parties,
and
the
local
rules
and
the
federal
rules
also
serve
that
purpose,
and
here
you
have
no
party
suggesting
that
they
were
coerced
or
involuntarily
dragged
before
a
magistrate
judge
rather
than
an
article
iii
judge,
to
reverse
in
these
circumstances,
as
the
fifth
circuit
did,
to
sua
sponte
investigate
consent
when
there
is
no
question,
where
no
one
is
claiming
to
have
been
involuntarily
dragged
before
the
magistrate
judge,
would
be
to
import
some
sort
of
automatic,
per
se,
plain
error,
subject
matter
jurisdictional
principle
into
a
context
that
is
not
based
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction
but,
rather,
the
particularity
of
a
particular
officer
presiding
and,
as
justice
breyer
noted,
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine
exists
to
insulate
judgments
from
attack
that
have
a
technical
deficiency,
for
example,
not
signing
a
consent
form.
and
because
all
parties
voluntarily
proceeded
in
this
fashion,
their
consent
should
not
have
been
questioned
after
the
judgment
was
entered,
and
there
is
no
basis
to
find
any
sort
of
harm
to
any
of
the
parties
when
their
article
iii
rights
were
not
violated
in
any
respect,
and
for
these
reasons
we
would
ask
that
you
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit.
