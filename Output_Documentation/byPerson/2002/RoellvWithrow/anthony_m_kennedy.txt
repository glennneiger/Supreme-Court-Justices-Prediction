anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
the
consent
has
to
precede
the
action
of
the
magistrate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
there
had
to
have
been
consent
before
he
took
any...
the
magistrate
took
any
action
in
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
an
hour
into
the
trial,
somebody
hands
counsel
a
note
that
says,
your
honor,
we've
made
a
mistake,
our
office
said
we
can't
consent
to
this,
the
trial,
the
magistrate
should
say,
too
late,
you've
appeared,
you've
been
deemed
to
have
given
consent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
first
dispositive
motion
that
he
rules
on?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
we
need
a
whole
jurisprudence
parallel
to
the
simple
rules
that
you
all
didn't
follow.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
need
a
whole
jurisprudence
that's
parallel
to
the
simple
rule.
the...
the
object
of
the
rule
was
structural,
in
a
sense.
it
was
to
bring
home
to
the
parties
that
they
had
a
choice,
to
make
them
consider
the
choice,
to
make
sure
that
the
choice
was
not
in
any
way
forced
on
them
or
suggested
to
them,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
rule
defeats
all
of
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
your
rule
is
that
a
pro
se
defendant
has
to
tell
the
state
of
texas
how
to
comply
with
the
federal
rules?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
it's
like
personal
jurisdiction,
or
more...
it's
more
like
personal
jurisdiction
or
subject
matter--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
if
you
say
personal,
then
you
have
on
your
side
the
rule
that
a
general
appearance,
general...
as
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--as
a
rule
waives
deficiencies.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
of...
one
of
the
insulating
features
in
the
suggested
form
and
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
makes
it
express
that
the
consent
form
is
not
to
be
communicated
to
the
judge
or
the
magistrate
in
order
to
protect
the
attorneys
who
don't
consent
so
that
the
magistrate
or
the
judge
doesn't
know
which
party
doesn't
consent,
and
your
rule
completely
destroys
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
no,
but
you...
you
presume
a
regime
in
which
the
magistrate
said,
i'm
ready
to
proceed,
and
you...
somebody
stands
up
and
says,
well,
i
don't
consent.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
the
regime
you
want
us
to
adopt,
so
that...
that
destroys
the
confidentiality.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where
did...
where
did
the
congress
do
that?
you
say
the
congress
did
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how...
how
could
they
have
made
that
argument
in
this
case,
say,
well,
we
just
forgot
about
the
rule,
we
didn't
know,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i...
i
just
can't
imagine
what
the
state
attorney
general
would
say,
after
having
participated
in
a
trial
and
say,
well
you
know,
i
really
didn't
consent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
the
statute
says
that
consent
has
to
be
communicated
to
the
clerk.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
we
could
take
notice,
couldn't
we,
that
state
attorney
generals
might
not
want
to
antagonize
magistrates.
they're
going
to
be...
they're
institutional
litigants,
will
appear
there
all
of
the
time,
and
they
might...
and
they
might
be
reluctant
to
withhold
consent,
unless
they
could
do
it
under
the
anonymous
basis
provided
for
in
the
rules.
