g.

the
obvious
reading
of
a
statute
like
this
i
would
think,
and
you
tell
me
why
i'm
not
right,
but
it
just
means
consent
in
such
form
as
the
judicial
conference
or
local
rules
provide.
i
mean,
congress
is
perfectly
aware
in
these
procedural
statutes
that
judges
have
rulemaking
authority
and
that
they
elaborate
the
statute
through
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
also
aware
that
they're
writing
a
statute
for
the
judiciary
that's
implemented
through
rule,
and
where
you
have
a
term
like
this,
that
is
implemented
through
rule,
that
everybody
would
think
it
would
be
implemented
through
rule,
the
word
consent
in
the
statute
means
consent
in
the
form
that
the
rules
provide.
does
congress
have
to
add
that
every
time
in...
i
mean,
isn't
it
obvious?
or
perhaps
it
isn't,
but
why
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
wrong
with
that?
i
mean,
if
the
local
rule
is
okay,
what's
wrong
with
that,
i
mean,
if
that's
what
the
rule
authorities
want
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
it's
a
matter
of
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
matter
of
law.
very
often,
congress
legislates,
and
they
use
words
like
consent,
and
so
forth,
and
those
are
implemented.
i
don't
want
to
just
repeat
the
point.
i
want
to
be...
i
want
to
see
what
you
can--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--assume
you
lose
on
that,
just
for
the
sake
of
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
guess
the
other
question
is
whether
you
can
cure
the
violation
by
not
objecting
on
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i'm
saying,
suppose
that
there
is
not
consent.
suppose
i
were
to
believe
that
the
word
consent
in
the
statute
picks
up
the
method
of
the
rule,
at
least
it
rules
out
implied
consent,
so
suppose
i
held
against
you
on
that
point,
then
still
you'd
say,
we
win
anyway,
because
we
can
waive
this
requirement
by
just
not
objecting
on
appeal.
when...
when
the
other
side
appeals
it
we
say,
we
don't
care,
or
when
you
appeal
it
the
other
side
says,
we
don't
care.
we
consent
now.
what
happens
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
what,
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
argument
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
course,
that
you
can't
cure
a
basic
jurisdictional
problem.
you...
both
parties
could
not
go
out
on
the
street,
pick
the
third
person
whom
you
see
and
say,
you
decide
our
case,
and
then
you
appeal
his
decision,
and
when
somebody
says,
who's
that
person,
you
say,
we
waive
all
the
claims
that
he
isn't
a
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
is
why,
because
the
argument
that
it
is
like
a
person
on
the
street
is
that
a
magistrate
who
is
not
an
article
iii
judge
is
going
to
preside
over
a
jury
trial,
and
the
result
of
that
trial
will
have
all
the
trappings
and...
and
dignity
and
enforcement
power
of
a
judgment
of
a
court
of
the
united
states,
and
the
only
way
this
could
possibly
occur
is
if
the
parties
consent,
particularly
since
it's
a
jury
trial,
and
where
they
don't
consent,
he
really
is
like
a
person
off
the
street,
because
of
the
importance
of
what
the
parties
are
giving
up
in
order
to
obtain
his
judgment
rather
than
that
of
an
article
iii
judge.
all
right,
now
that's
the
other
side's
argument.
now,
i
want
to
know
how
you
respond.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i
thought
they
were
going
to
ask...
i
agree,
peretz
is
not
in
point,
because
it's
an
issue
where
they
did
consent,
but
the...
the...
there
is
a
doctrine
called
the
de
facto
officer
doctrine,
and
that
means
that
if
it's
a
fairly
unimportant
error,
it
can
be
waived.
for
example,
if
a
judge
sat
in
the
wrong
district,
or
the
judge
was
designated
to
sit
while
the
other
judge
was
sick,
and
then
the
other
judge
died,
so
he
wasn't
just
sick.
i
mean,
and
these
were
all
errors,
and
the
court
said,
well,
they
do
not
go
to
jurisdiction,
they're
waivable.
now,
why
isn't
this
case
like
that,
at
least
if
we
assume
there
was
real
consent
given,
it
was
just
implied.
it
violates
the
statute
all
right,
but
no
real
harm
is
done,
if
they
want
to
waive
it,
they
can?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
they'll
say,
this
is
sort
of
minor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
after
all
it's
not
that
important,
given
the
fact
they
gave
the
consent
anyway.
at
least,
they
showed
up
for
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
i'm
asking
you
really
to
answer,
why
isn't
it
trivial?
why
is
it
important?
why
isn't
it
small
enough
that
it
could
be
waived?
why
is
it
grand
enough
that
it
implicates
what
we
call
jurisdictional
error,
the
parties
can't
cure
it,
they
can't
waive
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
with
our...
suppose
you
have
a
defective
diversity
suit,
and
you
get
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
suddenly
discover
that
one
of
the
defendants
is
from
the
same
state,
that
there
are
many
defendants,
and
so
the
party
says,
oh,
don't
worry,
we'll
drop
him
out,
so
they
drop
him
out
at
the
appellate
stage.
does
that
rescue
the
whole
case,
or
do
you
have
to
do
it
all
over
again?
what
happens?
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
entry
of
which
judgment,
of
the
lower
court's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
district
court,
so
you'd
say
if
we're
doing
it
by
analogy,
you
win?
