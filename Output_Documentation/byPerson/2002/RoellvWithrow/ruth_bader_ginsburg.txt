justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
he
represented
at
the
trial,
withrow?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
she
was...
she--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
local
rule
did
require
express...
it
required
consent
in
writing
before
the...
the
proceeding,
didn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do...
do
we
know
how
this
came
about,
because
the
magistrate,
she
was
certainly
aware
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
she
asked
the
state,
do
you
consent,
and
whoever
was
representing
the
state
said,
well,
i
have
no
authority
to
do
that
today.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
one
of
the
defendants
did
put
in
a
form.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
take
it
from
your
argument
this
morning
you
would
say
that
these
defendants...
suppose
they
lost.
suppose
the
plaintiff
won.
they
could
not
then
say,
magistrate,
you
never
had
any
authority
because
we
did
not
give
you
in
advance
written
permission
to
proceed.
they
could
not...
they
would
be
bound.
is
that
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
not
asking
the
question
hypothetically.
i'm
asking,
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
defendants,
having
lost
instead
of
having
prevailed,
then
said,
aha,
now
we
can
get
out
of
it
because
we
never
formalized
our
consent,
you...
you
are
saying
that
they
could
not
have...
that
on
these,
on
the
facts
of
this
case
they
could
not
have
bowed
out
if
they
lost?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
the
text
does
not
require
express
consent.
i
beg
to
differ.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
does
not.
i
think
that's
how
you
want
us
to
interpret
it,
but
i
don't
think
the
word
is
there,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
could
be
implied.
that's
the
question
of
whether
the
consent,
if
it
is
required,
as
it
appears
to
be,
could
be
implied,
and
if
there
ever
were
a
case
for
implying
consent,
this
is
that
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not?
if...
justice
kennedy
brought
up
the
analogy
to
personal
jurisdiction.
if
one
makes
a
general
appearance
just
by
showing
up
in
court,
then
any
question
of
whether
the
court
would
otherwise
have
jurisdiction
is
gone,
because
there
is
jurisdiction,
personal
jurisdiction
by
consent,
just
by
making
a
general
appearance,
so
why
isn't
showing
up
in
that
magistrate's
courtroom,
going
to
trial
without
objecting,
why
isn't
that
equivalent
to
a
general
appearance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
could
understand
that
in
the
abstract.
in
the
concrete,
as
applied
to
this
case,
if
the
plaintiff,
the
pro
se
plaintiff
didn't
consent
and
then
lost,
i
could
see
an
argument
there,
but
this
is
the
state
attorney
general,
and
when
they
show
up
and
they
go
to
trial,
it
seems
to
me
it's
reasonable
to
imply
that
they
have
consented.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
ms.
frost--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you're
asking
them
to
engage
in
much
more
than
satellite
litigation
over
consent.
the
result
of
your
position
is
that
there
will
be
a
whole
new
trial,
so
it's
going
to
engage
the
court
much
more
than
making
a
determination
whether,
in
fact,
the
state
officials
consented
by
appearing
before
the
magistrate,
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it
was
the...
but
it
was
the
local
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it...
and...
so
we're
dealing
with
only
the
consequences,
and
i
could
see
if
this
were
a
big
question
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
you'd
say
that
the
parties
can't
waive
that,
but
this
kind
of
rule
is
at
a
much
lower
level.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then,
if
it's
jurisdictional
as
you
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
why
doesn't
1653
control?
title
28,
1653
reads,
defective
allegations
of
jurisdiction
may
be
amended
upon
terms
in
the
trial
appellate
court.
a
provision
like
that
would
take
care
of
the
pro
se
person,
because
the
court
could
say,
on
terms
it's
not
fair
to
hold
this
person,
this
pro
se
litigant
to
consent
that
that
person
didn't
give,
but
that
it's
perfectly
appropriate
to
hold
the
state
attorney
general,
so
even
if
we
grant
that
it
was
jurisdiction,
why
doesn't
60...
1653
take
care
of
it,
saying
defective
allegations
of
jurisdiction
may
be
amended
even
in
the
appellate
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you're
wrong
about,
that...
that
the
state
attorney
general
could
have
done
that,
and
if,
as
the
petitioners'
counsel
said,
they
would
have
been
stuck.
they
went
to
trial.
it's
just
like
making
a
general
appearance.
if
you're
wrong
about
that,
then
i
gather
that
you
would
lose,
because
then
you
would
have,
if
the
defendants
couldn't
get
out
at
the
end
of
it
by
saying,
sorry,
we
never
consented,
if
they
couldn't
get
out,
then
i
think
you
must
lose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one
dysjunction,
and
you
have
stressed,
and
i
think
rightly,
that
why
was
congress
doing
this?
it
didn't
want
parties
to
be
coerced
into
getting
a
magistrate
instead
of
an
article
iii
judge,
it
wanted
to
assure
voluntariness,
and
those
two
concerns
are
not
present
in
this
case.
i
mean,
nobody
is
suggesting
the
state
attorney
general
is
being
coerced,
or
didn't
do
this
voluntarily,
so
the
reasons
for
the
provision
don't
exist,
don't
match
this
case.
