justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
it
make
sense
under
a
statute
in
which
the
action
of
the
state
is
by...
by
definition
crucial?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
was...
that
was
never
an
issue
in...
in
the
north
carolina
case,
was
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
was
never
an
issue
in
the
north
carolina
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe...
maybe
justice
shouldn't
have
taken
the...
the
request.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
but
you
were
making
the
argument
a
moment
ago
that
if,
in
fact,
they
took
the
request
from
the
state
court
judge
in
north
carolina,
they
can
hardly
object
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
a
different
kind
of
argument.
and...
and
since
that
was
not
an
issue,
i...
i
don't
know
that
they
are
precluded,
or
would
be
precluded
from
changing
their
mind
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
they...
they
won't
have
that
problem
now,
will
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't...
wouldn't
it
also
be
ripe...
wouldn't
the
time
run
simply
if...
if
the
state
moved
to
vacate
the
injunction?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
at
that
point
wouldn't
it
have
signified
that
it
was,
indeed,
attempting
to
administer
the
plan?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it
now
seeks
to
vacate--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then
that
goes
back,
i
guess,
to
the
earlier
suggestion.
if...
if
this
court
indicated
that,
in
fact,
the
alternative
ground
was
prematurely
raised,
wouldn't
that
respond
to
the...
to
the
second--
justice
david
h.
souter
--except--
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
except
for
one
fact,
and
that
is
now
we
have
a
districting
statute
which...
which
is
the
later
one
in
time.
the...
the
districting
command
and
the
at-large
command
are
no
longer
of...
of
even
weight.
the
districting
command
is
later
in
time
and
therefore,
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
conflict,
that's
got
to
get
some
precedence.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
yes.
