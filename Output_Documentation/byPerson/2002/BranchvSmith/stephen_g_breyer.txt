justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a...
that's
the
problem
i
have
trying
to
figure
this
out.
suppose...
suppose
we
looked
at
the
preclearance,
and
suppose
i
thought
that
it
hasn't
been
precleared
and
it
should
have
been.
and
the
reason
it
hasn't
been
precleared
is
the
reason
that's
been
discussed,
that...
that
they
haven't
tried
to
administer
it
yet
and
when...
and
they...
and
the
department
has
60
days
from
the
time
that
the
state
tries
to
administer
it.
i
mean,
i
thought
that's
what
the
statute
says,
doesn't
it,
that
they
have--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
enacts
or
seeks
to
administer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
have
to
enact,
and
this
doesn't
sound
like
an
enactment.
it
sounds
like
something...
seek
to
administer,
and
they
haven't
sought
to
administer
it.
all
right.
so
then
we'd
send
it
back.
then
the
department
would
have
to
decide
whether
to
preclear
it.
well,
they
may
well
preclear
it.
or
what
happens
next?
that's
where
i'm
a
little
confused.
i
mean,
it...
the...
the
real
constitutional
issue
here...
or
one
of
them
anyway...
is
assuming
there
is
the
preclearance,
then
has
the
mississippi
court
acted
unconstitutionally
in
assuming
authority
to
issue
a
plan,
whereas
previously,
the
mississippi
court
had
said
you
lack...
we
lack
that
authority.
and
all
of
a
sudden,
we
have
an
order
here
which
seems
to
overrule
in
earlier
cases,
and
it
doesn't
even
have
an
opinion.
in
other
words,
can
you
help
clarify
what
we
should
say
in
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
we
ended
up
thinking
it
should
be
precleared?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
that's...
that's
true,
but
look,
there's
a
case,
wise
v.
lipscomb--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
you've
seen,
and
in
that
case,
this
court
says,
in
those
circumstances...
which
are
these...
until
clearance
has
been
obtained,
a
court
should
not
address
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
measure.
so,
we
said
specifically,
don't
address
it.
now,
what...
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
chance
the
legislature...
which
is
its
job,
i
take
it...
will,
in
fact,
enact
a
plan
during
that
period
of
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
does
it
remove
the
federal
obstacle
if...
instead
of
passing
on
the
hypothetical
of
whether
the
federal
ground,
which
is
a
alternative
ground,
et
cetera
is
good
or
bad...
if
we
just
repeated
the
language
from
wise
versus
lipscomb,
said
it's
premature
to
decide
this
constitutional
issue,
our
cases
say
not
to,
but
there's
an
alternative
ground
here?
that
would
make
it
clear
to
everybody,
wouldn't
it,
that
the
ground
on
which
the
federal
injunction
rests
is
the
preclearance
ground?
and
then,
would
the
state
say,
okay,
if
it's
the
preclearance
ground,
we're
going
to
administer
it.
and
then,
the
60
days
would
begin
to
run,
and
then
you're
out
from
under
this
strange
stalemate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that,
but
if
i
don't
agree
with
you
about
that,
then
would
it
satisfy
what
you're
really
after
which
is
to
get
out
of
the
stalemate?
you
see,
we
would
just
simply
point
out
that
this
is
an
alternative
ground
and...
and
it
has
no
real...
we're
not
reaching
it
because
it's...
there's
this
other
ground.
in
other
words,
i'm
repeating
what
i've
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
get
you
out
of
the
stalemate.
i'm
trying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--are
there
two
injunctions?
i
thought
there
was
just
one
injunction
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--two
grounds.
so
if
we
suggest
that
one
of
the
grounds
was
premature,
then
doesn't
that
do
the
trick?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
meanwhile,
the
legislature
will
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
why
can't
we
just
do
what
we'd...
i'd
suggested
anyway...
i
think
others
did
too...
that...
that
you...
you...
we'd
simply
say,
look,
here's
an
injunction.
it
rests
on
two
grounds.
ground
one,
this
plan
hasn't
been
precleared,
the
mississippi
plan,
the
court
plan.
ground
two,
it's
unconstitutional.
you'd
say
ground
two
is,
a,
premature,
doesn't
really
support
the
issue,
it's
an
injunction...
because
it's
premature,
et
cetera.
and
now
you'd
have
a
decision
that,
i
guess,
from
a
legal
point
of
view
insofar
as
we
were
right
about
that,
would
just
rest
on
the
ground
that
it
hasn't
been
precleared.
and
since
that's
the
only
reason
for
issuing
the
injunction,
then
the
department,
if
the
state
of
mississippi
wants
to
put
the
plan
in
effect,
would
preclear
it.
if
the
state
doesn't
want
to
put
it
in
effect,
well,
that's
their
business.
but...
but
if
they
are
going
to
put
it
in
effect,
then
the
department
would
have
to
get
busy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we're
in
an
unusual...
i
mean,
this
is
unusual
because
i
guess
we
would
be
reviewing
a
reason
for
the
judgment.
it's
unusual
because
there's
a
legislature
that
doesn't
want
to
reapportion.
and
the
third
aspect
in
which
it's
unusual
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
according
to
some
of
the
parties,
has
overturned
previous
cases
of
that
court
which
said
the
chancery
court
lacks
the
power
to
enter
the
plan,
and
it
did
it
without
writing
an
opinion.
it's
normal
that
a
court
writes
an
opinion.
now,
is
there
any
likelihood
or
chance
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
before
this
issue
comes
back
to
us,
if
it
does,
would
explain
what
the
reason
is
for
departing
from
what
seems
to
be
a
long
precedent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
also
have
to
reach
your
issue,
don't
we?
even
if
we
agree
with
you
on
that,
we
still
have
to
reach
the
cross-appeal
issue,
don't
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
do
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
get
your...
to
get
your
result,
you
have
to
read,
there
shall
be
established
by
state
law
a
number
of
districts,
et
cetera.
and...
and,
in
fact,
it's
pretty
hard
to
read
it
that
way,
for
me
it
seems,
because
this
thing,
there
shall
be
established
by
law
a
number
of
districts,
i.e.,
not
at-large,
was
enacted
by
congress
in
response
to
courts
that
had
threatened...
courts,
not
legislatures...
that
had
threatened
at-large
elections.
and
so
they
were
quite
unhappy
about
that
in
congress,
and
they
passed
this
law
saying
there
shall
be
established
by
law
a
number
districts.
it
seems
to
me
their
object
was
certainly
court
districting,
wasn't
it,
as
well
as
legislative
districting?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
can't
a
state
just
say
we
require
our
legislature
under
state
law
to
conform
to
the
federal
requirements
by
having
a
plan
by
january
15th
by
going
to
the
chancery
court
if
you
don't
have
a
plan,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
the
state
of
mississippi
says,
well,
that
in
effect
is
what
they
did,
don't
we
have
to
take
their
word
for
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
a
state
court,
and
here
we
have
an
unexplained
judgment
without
an
opinion
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
which
seems
to
say
that's
what
it
is.
it
doesn't
say,
but
that's
the
holding
of
it.
