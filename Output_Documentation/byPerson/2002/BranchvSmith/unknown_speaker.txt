is
there?
unknown

i
mean,
in...
in
the
north
carolina
case,
they
were
not
violating
any--
unknown

so--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
feldman.
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman,
let's
assume
that
we
agree
with
everything
you
say
in
your
brief,
and
we
agree
it's
not
been
precleared.
isn't
the...
will
the
injunction
that's
now
in
place
prevent
further
preclearance?
one
of
the
reasons
for
not
preclearing
before
was
there's
this
injunction
standing--
unknown
speaker
--and
that's
still
an
obstacle,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
only
way
to
make
that
clear
would
be
to
vacate
the--
unknown
speaker
--the
other
ground.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
unless
that
injunction
is
vacated,
we're
at
a
stalemate.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
it
was
really
wrong
for
the
district
court
to
reach
out
and
unnecessarily
decide
a
constitutional
question.

the
statutory
language
is
not...
is
not
whether
it's
in
effect
or
not.
it's
whether
he's
seeking
to
administer
it.
that's
the
problem.
