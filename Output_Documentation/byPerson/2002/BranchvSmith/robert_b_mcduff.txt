mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
justice
stevens,
may
it
please
the
court:
for
40
years,
ever
since
the
decision
in
baker
versus
carr,
state
court
judges,
like
federal
judges,
have
played
a
role
in
addressing
constitutional
problems
stemming
from
malapportionment.
this
was
reflected
in
scott
versus
germano
in
1965,
and
again
in
growe
versus
emison
in
1993
when
the
court
said
not
only
that
state
judges
play
a
role,
but
they
are
preferred
to
federal
judges
as
agents
of
reapportionment.
in
this
congressional
redistricting
case
from
mississippi,
the
chancery
court
of
hinds
county,
acting
with
the
blessing
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
stepped
into
the
breach
and
adopted
a
plan
when
the
legislature
defaulted.
that
plan
has
been
enjoined
by
the
federal
district
court,
and
the
united
states
department
of
justice
has
said
not
once,
but
twice
that
it
was
postponing
the
statutory
time
period
for
preclearance
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
so
that
even
now,
nearly
1
year
after
the
plan
was
adopted
and
submitted,
no
preclearance
decision
has
been
made.
a
federal
court
order
is
in
place
telling
state
courts
they
may
not
hear
congressional
redistricting
cases.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
they
did
not,
your
honor,
but
we
did.
and
we
were
allowed
to
intervene
in
this
case
to
defend
the
state
court
judgment,
which
my
clients
had
a
right
to
seek,
and
which
they
did
secure
redistricting
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i
don't...
i
don't
know...
i
respectfully
disagree,
justice
scalia.
this
is
a
state
court
order,
and
the
attorney
general
of
mississippi
has
no
right
to
refuse
it
or
not,
and
he
certainly
has
no
right
to
undo
it.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
that's
correct,
but...
but
unlike
the
situation...
but
we...
i
guess
my
first
answer
is,
we
did
appeal
it,
and
so
the
injunction
is--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--is
subject
to
being
overruled.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
that's
correct.
but
unlike
a
situation
where,
for
example,
an
injunction
is
issued
against
a
criminal
law,
or
regulatory
provision
that
the
attorney
general,
or
the
state
defendants
have
some
discretionary
authority
to
enforce,
and
where
it
makes
sense
that
if
they
do
not
want
to
appeal,
no
one
else
should
be
allowed
to
appeal
if
they're
not...
if
they
don't
care
enough
about
enforcement,
this
is
an
order
that
the
attorney
general,
and
the
state
defendants
are
required
to
obey,
assuming
federal
obstacles
are
eliminated.
now,
if
the
attorney
general
doesn't
appeal
for
whatever
reason,
it
makes
sense
to
allow
the
people
who
secured
the
judgment
in
state
court
to
intervene
and
defend
that.
otherwise--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--because
the
action
of
the...
the
action
of
the
state
here
is
the
action
of
the
state
courts,
and
they
have
issued
an
injunction.
the
attorney
general
cannot
undo
that.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i
think...
i
think
the
executive
is
seeking
to
administer
it
just
as
much
as
he
was
back
when
the
plan
was
first
submitted.
if
the
federal
obstacles
are
removed...
the
constitutional
injunction,
and
the
preclearance
obstacle...
the
state
defendants
are
going
to
abide
by
the
order
of
the
chancery
court,
and
submit
this
plan--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--to
remove
the
section
5
obstacle
as
quickly
as
possible,
consistent
with
the
60-day
deadline
in
the
statute,
so
that
once
the
constitutional
obstacle
is
removed,
the
plan
can
be
in
force.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
well,
that...
that
is
assuming
that...
that
my
clients
don't
have
standing,
and
i
think
we
clearly
do
as
parties
who
secured
the
state
court
judgment.
otherwise,
you
would
be
in
a
situation
where
the
attorney
general
could
unilaterally
nullify
the
state
court
injunction
simply
by
not
defending
it.
that's
one
reason
my
clients
were
allowed
in
this
case,
was
to
defend
the
state
court
injunction
they
secured.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
there
is
an
appeal
pending
filed
by
the
state
court
intervenors
challenging
the
chancery
court's
plan.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
that...
the
briefs
have
been
filed.
no
oral
argument
is
scheduled.
i
think...
i...
i
don't
know,
but
i
think
the
mississippi
supreme
court
is
waiting
to
hear
from
this
court
what
it
should
do
because
it
is
looking
at
a
federal
court
order
telling
it
it
has
no
business
in
congressional
redistricting.
and
the...
the--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
well,
we...
we
are
certainly
asking
this
court
to...
to
vacate
the
federal
court
order.
and--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--it
says
60
days
after
it's
submitted,
it's--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i
think...
i
think
there
are
two
things
we
want
you
to
say.
first
is
that
the
federal
court's
constitutional
basis
for
the
injunction
is
wrong,
and
that
mississippi
courts,
like
courts...
like
courts
throughout
the
country,
do
have
a
right
to
adjudicate
congressional
redistricting
cases,
at
least
where
the
legislature
defaults.
and
then,
second,
we
are
asking
you
to
rule
that
as
a
result
of
the
passage
of
the
60-day
period,
the
plan
has
been
precleared.
if
you
agree
with
us
on
the
first
issue,
disagree
on
the
second,
then
the...
then
the
matter
will
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
and
the
preclearance
process--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--will
go
forward
in
the
justice
department.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i
don't
know
if
it
was
a
conditional
ruling,
justice
ginsburg.
it
was
an
alternative
ruling,
and
we
are
appealing
both
grounds.
and
i
think
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
deal
with
them
both
in
one
appeal
rather
than--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--well--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--the...
i...
i
think
it
was,
and
i
do
think
it
is
necessary
to
reach
that
issue
because
otherwise,
we're
going
to
go...
if...
however
you
rule
on
the
section
5
issue,
the
case
goes
back
down.
hopefully
the
plan
is
either
declared
precleared
by
this
court
or
later
precleared
by
the
attorney
general.
the...
the
district
court
is
simply
going
to
reinstate
that
constitutional
ruling.
this
case
will
come
back
up
here
on
appeal,
and
we'll
be
into
the
2004
election
cycle.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
that...
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
cases
from
which
that
statement
emanates,
and
the
only
cases
in
which
this
court
has
been
called
upon
to
apply
that
principle
are
connor
versus
waller,
and
united
states
versus
board
of
supervisors
of
warren
county,
which
we
discuss
at
the
beginning
of
our
reply
brief.
but
those
are
cases
that
are
very
different
from
this
one.
in
those
cases,
the
federal
district
courts
substituted
constitutional
analysis
for
the
preclearance
process
and...
and
ordered
the
use
of
un-precleared
plans.
here
the
federal
district
court
enjoined
the
use
of
a...
an
allegedly
un-precleared
plan
and
gave
an
alternative
ruling
the
same
way
courts
do...
the...
in
the
same
fashion
that
courts
do
all
the
time.
and
in
these
circumstances,
i
think
it
makes
sense
to
go
ahead
and
deal
with
both
issues
on
the
appeal
so
we
don't
have
this
case
bouncing
up
and
down
the
appellate
ladder
while,
number
one,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
is
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
do,
and
number
two,
we've
got
a
march
1,
2004
deadline
approaching.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i...
there's
certainly
no
indication
that
the
legislature
will,
your
honor.
and...
and
that's
why
it
is
important
for...
as...
as
the
court
said
in
growe
v.
emison,
for
state
courts
to
be
able
to
step
into
the
breach,
and
deal
with
the
problem
without
the
sort
of
obstacles
that
the
federal
court
has
imposed
here,
first
on
the
constitutional
grounds,
and
then
second,
on
the
section
2
grounds
because
we
contend
the
plan
has
been
precleared.
and
let
me
respond
to
one
other
thing--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
that...
that's
right.
the--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--that's
right.
but
if
this
court
resolves
the
issue
on
the...
in...
in
reviewing
the
federal
district
court's
injunction,
then
the
state
court
will
not
be
in
the
position
of
having
to
do
that.
and
the...
the...
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
question
of
seeks
to
administer
because
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
the
mississippi
court...
the
mississippi
courts
adopted
a
plan
to
be
used
in
elections
as
long
as
the
section
5
obstacle
is
used...
is
removed,
and
any
other
federal
constitutional
obstacles
are
removed.
and
as...
as
the
opinion
says...
justice
o'connor
said
in
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
lopez
versus
monterey
county...
the
second
lopez
decision...
seeks
to
administer
is
simply...
it...
it's
not
necessarily
a
term
of
discretion.
you
can
either
seek
to
administer
or
not,
but
is
a...
it
is
a...
the
seek
is
a
temporal
phrase
showing
that
the...
the
plan
should
be
submitted
prior
to
its
administration.
and
here,
the
attorney
general
doesn't
have
any
discretionary
authority,
and
i
think
it
would
be
contrary
to
section
5
if
he
were
able
to
undo
the
chancery
court's
order
simply
by
the
fact
that
he
didn't
appeal
this
case
when
he
knew
we
were
appealing.
the...
in
fact,
there's...
we've
referred
frequently
to
the
north
carolina
preclearance
of
the
plan
adopted
there
by
a
state
court
regarding
legislative
districts.
and
if
you
look
in
the
appendix
to
the
naacp
amicus
brief,
there
is
the
letter
of
submission
sent
by
the
trial
judge
in
north
carolina
to
the
justice
department
where
he
submitted
the
plan.
the
attorney
general
didn't
submit
it.
in
fact,
the
attorney
general
had
opposed
imposition
of
the
state
court
plan
during
the
state
court
proceedings.
that
plan
was
precleared,
and
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
if
the
justice
department
can
preclear
a
plan
submitted
by
a
state
court
judge,
it
cannot
come
here
in
this
case,
and
say
that
a
state
court
judge...
a
state
court
plan
from
a
mississippi
judge
is...
has
been
withdrawn,
or
has
been
suspended
simply
by
the
simple
act
of...
simply
by
the
simple
fact
that
the
attorney
general
did
not
take
an
appeal
in
this
case.
that
was
taken
by
us.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
oh,
no,
there
was
not
an
issue,
but
i'm
just
pointing
out
that...
i
mean...
i
mean--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--the...
the...
oh,
i
think
justice
should...
justice
definitely
should
consider
a
submission
from
a
state
court
judge.
section...
section
5
says--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
oh,
all
i'm...
all
i'm
saying,
justice
souter,
is
i
don't
think
they
can
come
in
here
and
say
that
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
did
not
appeal
here--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--means
that
the
submission
was
withdrawn
or
suspended.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
justice
scalia,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
premise
that
the
state
in
mississippi
has
no
intention
of
administering
this
plan.
once
the
constitutional
obstacle
is
removed,
if
it
is,
and
once
preclearance
is
declared,
if
it
is,
the
state
defendants
are
going
to
administer
their
plan...
that
plan.
they
are
under
a
state
court
order
to
do
so.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
say
that
the
mississippi
situation
is
somehow
different
from
the
north
carolina
situation
is
to...
is
to
exalt
the
form
over
the
substance.
certainly
in
mississippi
the
state
court
judge
could
have
submitted
that
plan.
the
state
court
judge,
i
guess,
could
have
intervened
in
the
case,
in
the
federal
case,
and
appealed
if
the
attorney
general
didn't.
but
that
would
be
quite
unusual,
instead--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
but...
but,
justice
scalia,
the...
the
failure
of
the
attorney
general
to
take
an
appeal
is
no
indication
that
he
will
not
administer
the
plan
once
the
federal
obstacles
are
removed.
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
he
will
obey
the
state
court
order.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
the...
the
60
days,
in
our
view,
justice
breyer,
has
already
run.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
then
i...
i
think...
i
think--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--i...
i
think
that
gets
us
exactly
nowhere
because
the
department
has
said
it
is
not
going
to
resume
the
preclearance
process
as
long
as
the
constitutional
injunction
is
in
place.
so
unless
it's
vacated,
the
preclearance
process--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--i'm
sorry.
there's
one
injunction.
two
grounds.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
well,
i
think
it
does...
it
does
get
the
process
ticking
again.
but
the
problem
is
at
that
point,
once
it
is
declared
precleared,
the
federal
district
court
will
impose
its
constitutional
injunction,
we'll
be
back
up
here.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
will
still
be
facing
that
injunction.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
well,
that's...
that's
wishful
thinking.
and
it--
[laughter]
if
it
were
true,
we
wouldn't
be
here
i
think.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
no.
i
think
it
was
the
difficulty
of
pairing
two
incumbents,
and
they
couldn't
agree.
they
couldn't
agree
on
how
to
do
it
because
we
lost
a
seat
in
mississippi.
let
me
make
one--
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
--no,
they
won't
have
that
problem
now.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
but
i
still
think
there's...
there's
been
no
indication
thus
far
that
any
action
is
going
to
be
taken
in
that
respect.
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
thank
you,
your
honor.
justice
breyer,
the
state
of
mississippi
does
want
to
put
the
plan
into
effect.
that
was
the
order
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
however
brief
it
was,
saying
the
chancery
court's
plan
will
remain
in
effect
until...
unless
superseded
by
a
timely
plan
of
the
state
legislature.
the
attorney
general
submitted
the
plan
for
preclearance
under
order
by
the
chancery
court.
he
has
done...
he
has
not
withdrawn
the
preclearance
submission.
mr.
robert
b.
mcduff
and...
and
there's
nothing
about
the
absence
of
the
appeal
here,
particularly
where
we
are
taking
the
appeal,
that
suggests
he's
not
seeking
to
administer
it,
justice
scalia.
and
let
me
mention
one
other
thing
along
those
lines.
the
language
is
enact
or
seek
to
administer.
now,
the
lesson
of
growe
v.
emison,
at
least
we
think,
is
that
a
state
court
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
legislature
when
the
legislature
defaults
on
redistricting,
and
certainly
if
the
legislature
had
enacted
this
plan,
and
the...
it
had
been
enjoined
by
the
federal
court
for
whatever
reasons,
and
the
attorney
general
had
not
taken
an
appeal,
but
legislative
leaders
had
or
intervenors
had,
i
don't
think
we
would
say
that
the
preclearance
submission
was
thereby
withdrawn.
it
seems
to
me
the
state
court
is
in
no
different
position,
and
we
shouldn't
say
that
the
attorney
general's
failure
to
appeal
here
would
withdraw

by

60

certainly
by
the
time
of
the
second
60

where
the
justice
department
said,
we're
not
going
to
continue
to
review
this
plan
because
of
the
constitutional
injunction.
well,
there's
no
language
in
section
5
that
stops
the
60-day
period
from
running
on
that
ground.

and
in
fact,
the

not

in

here
there
are
compelling
reasons
why
it
is
important
for
the
60-day
period
to
be
removed
even
if
there's
a
constitutional
injunction.
often
these
cases
are
decided
under
severe
time
constraints.
if
a
constitutional
injunction
is
imposed,
state
officials
may
try
to
remove
it
as
quickly
as
possible
and
restore
the
plan
in
time
for
the
election.

the...

it,
in
effect,
prolongs
itself
by
feeding
off
the
constitutional
injunction,
and
even
if
the
constitutional
injunction
is
vacated,
the
state
still
has
to
deal
with
this
now-postponed
section
5
obstacle
that
will
not
be
removed
in
some
situations
in
time
for
the
election.
let
me
say
one
other
thing
about
the
constitutional
ruling,
the
fact
that
it
was
an
alternative
ground.
we
think
there
is
doubt
about
the
section
5
ground,
as
we've
suggested
here,
and
particularly
given
the
importance
of
resolving
these
cases
so
that
elections
can
go
forward
without
continued
federal
court
interference,
i
think
it
is
crucial
for
this
court
to
rule
on
the
constitutional
ground,
as
well
as
the
preclearance
ground
here.
the
rule
of
connor,
and
the
rule
of
the
warren
county
case
are
not
jurisdictional
rules.
they're
supervisory
rules
imposed
by
this
court
to
ensure
the
orderly
processing
of
the
section
5
issue
when
it's...
when
it's
in
a
case
in
which
other
issues
are
involved.
here
the
orderly
processing
of
this
litigation,
and
the
creation
of
the
situation
where
mississippi
can
conduct
its
elections
in
2004
without
continued
confusion
of
the
type
that
we
had
at
the
last
election,
that
interest
favors
resolving
the
constitutional
issue
now,
at
the
same
time
the
section
5
issue
is
resolved.
and
so
for
all
of
these
reasons
and
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
respectfully
urge
that
the
court
vacate
the
injunction
of
the
district
court
on
all
grounds.
