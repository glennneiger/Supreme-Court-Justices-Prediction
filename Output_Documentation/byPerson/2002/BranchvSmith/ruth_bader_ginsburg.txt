but
if
we're
talking
about
section
5,
the
language
of
section
5
is
whenever
a
state
shall
enact
or
seek
to
administer
any
voting
qualification,
et
cetera.
and
because
the
state
is
not
currently
seeking
to
administer
anything,
enact,
i
take
it
means
legislation.
seek
to
administer
could
be
the
executive,
but
the
executive,
since
it's
not
appealing
the
injunction,
isn't
currently
seeking
to
administer
anything.
justice
ruth

but
mr.
mcduff,
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
mcduff,
on
your
first
point,
which
you
would
like
us
to
decide
first,
i
thought
the
district
court
expressly
made
that
a
contingent
ruling.
didn't
it
say
if
we're
wrong
on
that
this
plan
hasn't
been
precleared,
if
we're
wrong,
then
we
have
this
alternate
constitutional
point.
they
phrased
it
that
way
as
if
to
say,
we
would
like
the
court
to
understand
that
our
principle
ruling
is
that
this
plan
hasn't
been
precleared.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
we're
reversed
on
that,
then
we
have
something
else
we
want
the
court
to
know
about.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
a
highly
conditional
ruling,
the
kind
of
ruling,
let's
say,
that
a...
that
a
trial
court
would
make
under
rule
50,
when
it
conditionally
rules
on
a
new
trial
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
clue,
by
the
way,
why
in
all
this
time--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
there
any
clue
why,
in
all
this
time,
the
legislature
has
not
acted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
district
court...
didn't...
isn't
that
what
the
district
court
said
when
it
said
this
is
our
alternative
holding
in
the
event
that
on
appeal,
it
is
determined
that
we
erred
in
our
february
19
ruling?
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
contingent
ruling.
if
we're
right
about
that
it
hasn't
been
precleared,
then
this
doesn't
come
into
play.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one...
one
could
agree
with
the
court,
what
it
was
intending
to
do
and
give
effect
to
what
it
was
intending
to
do,
and
if
we
should
hold,
if
we
should
agree
with
the
court,
that
there's
no
precleared
plan,
then
it
would
be
appropriate
to
vacate
the
decision
to
the
extent
that
it
rests
on
the
constitutional
ground.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
long
does
it
take
if
you
take
the...
if
you
said
derail
the
preclearance
procedure
before
the
attorney
general,
switch
to
the
d.c.
district
court
track?
how
long
do
those
proceedings...
section
5
proceedings...
in
the
district
court
ordinarily
take?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
there
is
something
unusual
about
that
request
for
information.
it
seems
to
have
been
triggered
by
the
district
court.
i'm
looking
at
page
100a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
where
the
district
court
is
commenting
on
this
opinion,
this
opaque
opinion,
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
that
says
the
chancery
court
has
authority,
and
then
says...
this
is
the
end
of
the
first
paragraph
on
the
page...
that
at
the
very
least,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
will
consider
the
implications
very
carefully
and
might
perhaps
request
more
information.
i'm
not
aware
of
the...
of
district
courts
telling
the
attorney
general
how
the
preclearance
process
should
run.
is
this
standard
operating
procedure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
wallace,
one
thing
isn't,
i
think,
debatable
and
that
is
since
2c
is
on
the
books,
no
court
has
ever
resorted
to
whatever...
was
2a,
whatever.
since
2c
is
there,
that's
the
one
that
the
courts
have
used,
is
that
not
so?
