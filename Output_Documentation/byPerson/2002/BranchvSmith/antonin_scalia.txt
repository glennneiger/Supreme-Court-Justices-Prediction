justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
the
issue
is
whether
the
state
was
still
pursuing
the...
the
redistricting
that
was
the
subject
of
the
application
to
the
attorney
general,
and
whether
it
was
doing
so
or
not
depended
upon
whether
the
state
was
appealing
from
the
federal
injunction.
if
the
state
accepted
the
federal
injunction,
it
no
longer
was
pursuing
the...
the
reapportionment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
he
also
has
no
right
to
ignore
a
federal
injunction--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unless
he...
unless
he
appeals
it.
he
has
every
right
to
appeal
it.
he
represents
the
state,
and
he
chose
not
to
appeal
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
not
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
with
that
is
that
you're
not
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
would...
we
would
not
require
the...
the
state
or
the...
the
federal
courts
to
do
a
vain...
or
the
attorney...
the
federal
attorney
general
to
perform
a
vain
act.
what
use
would
it
be
for
him
to
approve
the
reapportionment
when
the
state
attorney
general
is
still
subject
to
a
federal
court
injunction
which
he
has
not
appealed
and
therefore
cannot
ignore?
what
possible
good
would
it
be
for
the
attorney
general
to...
to
approve
the...
the
apportionment?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
constitutional
obstacle
won't
be
removed
as
long
as
the
attorney
general
doesn't...
doesn't
appeal
the
federal
court
injunction.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
is
our
decision
going
to
affect
that
federal
court
order?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
our
decision
going
to
affect
that
federal
court
order?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue
when
there's
no
need
to
do
so?
i
mean,
if...
if
we
agree...
if...
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
second
point,
there's
no
need
for
us
to...
to
rule
on...
on
the
first
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
the
same
token--
--whether...
whether
or
not
the...
the
federal
district
court
used
it
as
a
makeweight,
there's
just
no
need
for
us
to
reach
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
that's...
that's
not
what
they're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
they...
what
they
did
not...
what
they
did
not
object
to
is
the
fact
that
it
was
not
the
attorney
general
who
had
to
submit
the
request
here.
that's
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
provision
of
the
statute
which
required,
before
it
could
be
precleared,
that
the
state
be
about
to
administer
it.
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
the
person,
or
the...
the
entity
of
the
state
that
is
seeking
to
administer
it
must
be
the
one
who
applies
for
clearance.
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
so,
all
that
was
at
issue
in
north
carolina
is
whether
the...
the
administering
person
has
to
be
the
one
to
seek
clearance.
and
at
most,
the
case
stands
for
no
answer
to
that
question.
it
certainly
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
whether,
when
the
state
has
no
intention
of
administering
it,
which
is
the
situation
here,
and
was
not
the
situation
in
north
carolina,
the...
the
attorney
general,
nonetheless,
has
to
reply.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
he
have
administered
the
plan?
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
the
crucial
question.
yes,
he
could
do
all
that,
but
could
he
have
administered
the
plan?
if
not,
his
intention
to
go
forward
is
no
indication
that
the
state
is...
is
seeking
to
administer
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's...
that's
dictum.
i
mean,
what
the
district
court
said
about
that
is...
is
dictum.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
says
until
a
constitutional
plan
is...
is
precleared,
but
what
is
a
constitutional
plan
was
not
before
the
court.
now
you
may
well
know
how
the
district
court
is
going...
going
to
rule
on
it,
but
you
don't
know
that
the
district
court
will
be
affirmed
in
that
ruling,
or...
i
don't...
i
don't
see
how
the...
the
constitutional
ruling
is
embodied
in
the
injunction.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it
meant
just
by
a
court?
it
would
really
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
the
legislatures
to...
to
do
what
they're
supposed
to,
and
to
enact
these
districts
by
law.
it
would
take
a
lot
of...
a
lot
of
these
cases
that...
that
place
the
burden
upon
the
district
judge
to
reapportion
a
whole
state
would
go
away.
he'd
say,
if
the
legislature
doesn't
ask,
all
of
you
guys
are
going
to
run
at
large.
boy,
that
would...
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
not
happen.
the
legislature
would,
indeed,
do
the
job
it's
supposed
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it...
it
would
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
interpret
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
in
affirming
that,
we
certainly
can
say
why
we're
affirming
it.
and...
and
if
we
say,
yes,
the
injunction
is
valid
for
one
reason,
and
one
reason
only,
we
do
not
reach
the
other...
the
other
reason,
and
there
is
no
basis
for
reaching
the
other
reason.
certainly
we
can
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
side
doesn't
agree
they
were.
would...
would
you
bet
your
life
that
they're...
that
they're
right
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
court
has
ever
done
it
before--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
all
of
the
years
that
courts
have
been
operating
under
this
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
2c
didn't
exist
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
repeating
the
1911
law
that
you
just
mentioned?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
did
they...
why
did
they
pass
it
if
it
didn't
do
anything
but...
but
say
what
the...
what
the
1911
law
already
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you've
got
to
give
me
some
plausible
reason.
i
mean--
--legislative
history
helps,
by
the
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
gather
the
legislative
history
you've
just
told
us
is,
as
usual,
on
both
sides
of
this
thing.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume--
justice
antonin
scalia
--go
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
there
would
be
no
possible
reason
for
reenacting
it
if
they're...
if
they're
going
to
be
construed
consistently,
just
as
they
were
when
they
were
both
enacted
simultaneously.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you...
what
do
you
answer
to
the...
the
fear
that
one
has
to
have
that
redistricting
by
having
all
the
elections
at
large
is
precisely
what
those
who
were
interested
in
diluting
minority
vote
would
like?
justice
antonin
scalia
these
cases
are
here
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
mississippi.
after
the
2000
census,
mississippi
lost
one
congressional
seat.
the
state
legislature,
however,
failed
to
pass
a
new
redistricting
plan.
beatrice
branch
asked
a
state
chancery
court
to
issue
a
redistricting
plan
for
the
2002
elections.
that
is
one
of
the
cases,
branch
versus
smith.
in
a
similar
action,
john
smith
asked
the
federal
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
mississipi
to
enjoin
the
state's
all
districting
plan
and
any
state
court
plan
and
to
order
at
large
elections
pursuant
to
a
provision
of
the
mississippi
code
and
2
u.s.c.
section
2a(c)(5)
or
alternatively
to
devise
its
own
redistricting
plan.
the
three-judge
district
court
temporarily
deferred
to
the
state
court,
the
state
chancery
court,
but
began
crafting
its
own
plan
just
in
case.
the
district
court
set
a
deadline
for
the
state
court
to
complete
its
plan
and
to
have
it
precleared
pursuant
to
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
afterwhich
the
district
court
would
act.
specifically,
if
the
state
court
plan
was
not
precleared
by
february
25,
2002
the
federal
district
court
said
it
would
order
its
plan
used
for
the
2002
congressional
elections.
well,
the
state
court
did
prepare
a
plan
and
the
state
submitted
it
to
the
department
of
justice
for
preclearance.
however,
doj
requested
additional
information
from
the
state
noting
the
60-day
review
period
would
not
commence
until
that
additional
information
was
received.
such
additional
information
was
provided
five
days
before
the
federal
district
court's
february
25
deadline.
february
25,
2002
came
and
went
without
doj
preclearing
the
state
court
plan.
the
federal
district
court
therefore
enjoined
use
of
the
state
court
plan
and
ordered
use
of
its
own
redistricting
plan.
the
district
court
also
held
in
the
alternative
that
the
state
court
had
violated
article
i
section
4
of
the
united
states
constitution
by
promulgating
a
plan.
the
state
did
not
appeal.
that
is
a
crucial
fact.
the
department
of
justice
refused
to
give
the
state
court
plan
further
consideration
because
the
district
court's
injunction
rendered
the
state
court
plan
incapable
of
administration.
branch,
who
intervened
in
the
district
court
proceedings,
filed
this
appeal
contending
that
the
federal
court's
injunction
was
improper
because
the
state
court
plan
was
automatically
precleared
either
as
a
consequence
of
doj's
failure
to
object
within
60
days
of
the
state's
initial
submission
or
as
a
consequence
of
doj's
failure
to
object
within
60
days
of
the
state's
subsequent
submission.
branch
also
appealed
the
district
court's
holding
that
the
state
court
had
violated
article
i
section
4
of
the
constitution.
smith
cross
appealed
the
district
court's
decision
to
develop
its
own
redistricting
plan
rather
than
order
at
large
elections
pursuant
to
2
u.s.c.
2(a)(c)
and
mississipi
code.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
in
both
matters
and
now
that
you
understand
the
facts
we
affirm.
we
unanimously
hold
that
the
district
court
properly
enjoined
enforcement
of
the
state
court
plan.
a
jurisdiction
seeking
preclearance
under
the
voting
rights
act
must
provide
the
attorney
general
with
information
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
change
is
nondiscriminatory.
doj's
request
for
additional
information
in
this
case
was
neither
frivolous
nor
unwarranted
and
therefore
properly
postpone
the
initial
60-day
period.
the
state
court
plan
was
also
not
precleared
60
days
after
the
state
submitted
the
requested
information,
because
the
state
was
no
longer
at
that
point
seeking
to
administer
the
state
court
plan
which
is
what
is
required
for
preclearance
under
the
voting
rights
act.
the
state
had
failed
to
appeal
the
district
court's
injunction
and
therefore
the
state
court
plan
was
dead.
because
the
private
parties'
action
are
not
those
of
the
state
branch's
appeal
is
sufficient
to
demonstrate
that
the
state
was
still
seeking
to
administer
the
plan.
since
we
affirm
the
injunction
on
the
ground
that
the
state
court
plan
was
not
precleared
in
time
for
2002
election,
we
have
no
occasion
to
review
the
district
court's
alternative
article
i
section
4
holding
and
we
vacate
it
as
a
basis
for
the
injunction.
as
for
the
cross
appeal,
we
conclude
that
the
district
court
properly
fashioned
its
own
congressional
re-apportionment
plan
under
2
u.s.c.
section
2(c),
which
requires
that
states
be
divided
into
congressional
districts.
a
plurality
of
the
court
consisting
of
the
chief
justice,
justice
kennedy,
justice
ginsburg
and
i
would
hold
that
section
2(a)(c)
only
applies
when
a
state
legislature
and
courts
have
all
failed
to
redistrict
the
state
pursuant
to
section
2(c).
this
interpretation
allows
both
sections
2(a)(c)
and
section
2(c)
to
be
given
effect.
section
2(a)(c)
governs
the
manner
of
any
election
held
"until
a
state
is
redistricted
in
the
manner
provided
by
state
law
after
any
apportionment",
but
when
a
court
redistricts
pursuant
to
section
2(c),
it
necessarily
does
so
in
such
a
manner,
because
it
must
follow
the
state's
policies
and
preferences
for
the
districting
as
we
held
in
a
case
called
white
versus
weisser.
a
court
may
invoke
section
2(a)(c)'s
stop-gap
provision
only
when
an
election
is
so
eminent
that
redistricting
cannot
be
completed
without
disrupting
the
election
process.
as
for
mississippi's
at
large
election
provision,
it
envisions
both
legislatively
and
judicially
prescribed
redistricting
and
does
not
come
into
play
as
long
as
it
is
feasible
for
a
court
to
complete
the
redistricting.
justice
stevens
joined
by
justice
souter
and
justice
breyer
concur
in
part
and
concur
in
the
judgment.
while
agreeing
that
the
district
court
properly
enjoined
the
state
court
plan's
enforcement
and
promulgated
its
own
under
2
u.s.c.
section
2(c),
they
conclude
that
section
2(c)
impliedly
repealed
section
2(a)(c)
and
that
section
2-c
therefore
also
preempts
mississippi's
at
large
election
provision.
finally,
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
joined
in
part
by
justices
stevens,
souter
and
breyer,
and
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
