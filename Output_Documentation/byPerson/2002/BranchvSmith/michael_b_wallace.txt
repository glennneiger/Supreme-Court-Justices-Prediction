mr.
michael
b.
wallace
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
seems
that
the
court
is
focusing
on
the
question
of
preclearance
here,
and
the
real
problem
with
the
question
of
preclearance
is
that
the
justice
department
has
stopped
the
preclearance
process
because
of
the
injunction.
now,
we
believe
that
the
justice
department
acted
properly
in
so
doing.
they
have
a
regulation
that
says,
we
will
not
consider
premature
submissions,
and
this
court
said
in
georgia
that
any
reasonable
regulation
will
be
enforced.
their
position
is
that
whenever
the
state
has
been
told
it
cannot
administer
a
change,
then
it
cannot
be
seeking
to
administer
a
change
within
the
meaning
of
section
5,
and
therefore,
this
was
premature.
so
they
stopped.
now,
the
question
is
what
can
be
done
about
that,
and
i
think,
in
all
probability,
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
about
that
is
for
the
attorney
general
of
mississippi
to
go
down
the
street
to
the
district
court
and
ask
them
to
preclear
the
change
under
section
5
because
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
other
mechanism
whereby
anybody
can
force
the
justice
department
to
get
moving
on
a
section
5
preclearance.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
i
think
not,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
because
of
the
very
strange
system
of
divided
jurisdiction
that
congress
consciously
created
back
in
1965
when
it
said,
we
will
let
the
district
of
columbia
deal
with
statutory
questions.
we
will
let
the
court
back
home
deal
with
constitutional
questions.
that's
been
in
the
act
from
day
one,
and
it's
given
this
court
trouble
from
day
one.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
i've
never
been
in
one,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
that
i
could
tell
you,
but
i
would
think
it
would
take
close
to
a
year
anyway.
now--
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
--as
a
practical
matter,
justice
breyer,
that
might
get
the
process
moving,
because
i
think
i've
understood
the
united
states
to
indicate
that
they
would
get
moving
if
that's
what
the
court
did.
but
under
the
usual
rules
of
this
court's
jurisdiction,
it
sits
to
review
judgments
and
not
opinions.
and
the
judgment
is
that...
that
the...
that
the
district
court
plan
shall
stay
into
effect...
shall
stay
in
effect
until
preclearance
of
a
constitutional
plan
takes
effect.
that's
true--
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
--and
if...
and
if
the
court
does
say
that,
and
if
the
justice
department
does
get
moving
as
a
result
of
that
opinion,
then
that
will
move
the
process
along.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
i
suspect
the
mississippi
supreme
court
can
take
a
hint
as
well
as
the
justice
department,
justice
breyer.
there
was
no
error
in
this
injunction,
and
ordinarily,
the
court
would
not
edit
opinions
on
valid
judgments.
but
if
the
court
does
that,
then
certainly
the
justice
department
may
move.
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
may
move.
we
moved
for
a
stay
at
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
that
stay
was
denied.
the
briefing
is
finished.
there
has
been
no
stay
order.
i
presume
they
will
set
the
case
for
oral
argument
in
due
course.
but
if
they
get
an
opinion
from
this
court
that
says,
we'd
certainly
like
to
know
what
you
have
to
say,
i
think
i
can
say
with
confidence
that
they
will
set
the
case
with...
for...
for
argument
in
due
course.
so
as...
as
justice
breyer
says,
it
is
a
strange
case.
we
think
it
is
a
case
in
which
the
judgment
is
absolutely
correct,
and
the...
and
what
the
justice
department
has
done
is
absolutely
correct
under
its
regulations.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
the...
as...
as
justice
ginsburg
has
observed,
i
think
that
is
an
alternative
ground
in
the
opinion.
i
do
not
think
that
it
affects...
infects
the
judgment,
but
it
makes
a
problem,
as
mr.
mcduff
has
noted,
because
even
if
there
is
section
5
preclearance
down
the
road,
this
district
court
would
enjoin
it
again.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
we
believe
that
it
is
sufficient
to
uphold
the
judgment
below
because
there
is
no
error
in
the
judgment,
and
there
is
no
error--
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
--i
think
they
did
not,
although
it's
a
close
call.
in
ashwander--
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
--the...
the
district
court--
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
--and
that's
why
the
district
court
set
the
alternative
judgments.
i
think
they
thought
they
were
making
it
easier
for
this
court.
ashwander
doesn't
say
never
decide
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
we
certainly
agree
that
they
were,
and
if
they're...
and
if--
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
--i
would
be...
let
me
turn
to
that,
if
i
may,
justice
scalia,
because
we
believe
that
they
are...
that
the
justice
department
and
the
district
court
were
correct
on
the
section
5
ground.
and
that
goes
back
to
the
february
14th
letter
for
more
information.
as
the
assistant
solicitor
general
has
said,
that's
a
standard
application
of
georgia
versus
united
states.
when
you
have...
when
you
need
more
information
to
decide
a
section
5
issue,
then
the
justice
department
is
entitled
to
stop
the
clock
and
ask
for
more
information,
and
the
clock
won't
move
again
until
they
get
more
information.
this
is
a...
a
straightforward
application
of
a
regulation
that
this
court
has
already
approved.
the
district
court
so
found,
believed
that
the
request
for
more
information
was
absolutely
valid,
and
therefore
said,
there
has
been
no
approval,
there
is
no
plan
in
place,
and
for
that
reason,
we
must
put
in
a
plan
of
our
own.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
by
no
means
is
it
standard,
justice
ginsburg.
but
what
the
district
court
was
doing
in
this
case
was
deciding
whether
or
not
there
would
be
enough
time
for
the
preclearance
to
be
completed
before
the
qualifying
date.
the
intervenors
were
suggesting
we
did
not
need
a
federal
trial,
we
should
wait
for
the
justice
department
to
finish
its
work.
the
justice
department
already
had
before
it
a
complicated
submission
from
the...
from
the
attorney
general
of
mississippi,
which
begins
on
page
228...
221a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
and
that
presented
not
only
the...
not
only
the
congressional
redistricting
plan
itself,
but
also
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
to
overrule
70
years
of
precedent
and
allow
trial
courts
to
do
redistricting.
so
those
two
issues
were
already
before
the
justice
department
when
the
district
court
wrote.
but
all
the
district
court
wrote...
said
is,
we
think
we
better
get
busy
and
try
this
case
because
this
looks
like
a
real
hard
submission
to
us,
and
we're
not
sure
that
they're
going
to
be
able
to
decide
this
case
before
our
qualifying
date.
so
it's
unusual,
but
it's
certainly
well
within
the...
the
scope
of
what
the
district
court
was
being
asked
to
do.
and
i
think
they
properly
pointed
out
problems.
and...
and
with
the
help
of
the
district
court...
the
help,
indeed,
of
the
submission
that
attorney
general
moore
had
already
made,
i
think
the
justice
department
properly
saw
that
there
were
questions
that
needed
to
be
asked.
they
asked
those
questions,
and
that
stopped
the
60
days
from
running.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
i...
i
think
you
do.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
i
think
you
do
because
in...
because
once
it
is
conceded
that
the...
the
district
court
had
to
impose
a
remedy
in
2002,
then
the
question
arises
of
what
that
remedy
should
be.
and
it
was
our
position
in
the
district
court,
and
it
is
our
position
here
that
the
district
court
should
have
enforced
the
law
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
as
justice
stevens
has
observed,
says
that
you
must
have
at-large
elections,
and
an
act
of
congress
dating
back
to
1941
that
says
you
must
have
at-large
elections
in
these
circumstances.
that's
section
2a(c)(5)
of
title
ii.
we
ask
for
that
to
be
enforced,
and
that's
an
issue
that
i
think
must
be
reached
in
this
case
regardless.
i
think
the
united
states
has
the
only
argument
for
not
enforcing
the
1941
act.
they
claim
that
it
is
absolutely
incontrovertibly
inconsistent
on
its
face.
for
the
reasons
that
justice
o'connor
has
stated,
we
think
it
is
not
inconsistent
on
its
face.
we
also
point
back--
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
--no
court--
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
--this
court
did
it
under
almost
identical
statutes
70
years
ago
in
smiley
and
carroll
and
koenig.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
there
was
a
1911
act
that
said
basically
the
same
thing.
the
1911
act
says
you
shall
elect
representatives
by
districts,
but
at
the
same
time
it
says,
but
if
districts
have
not
be
redistricted,
then
any
new
representatives
will
be
elected
at
large.
and
that's--
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
--as
difficult
as
it
is
to
read
the
mind
of
congress,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
while
they
were
clearly
unhappy,
they
were
unable
to
agree
in
any
detail
on
what
ought
to
be
done.
and
even
on
section
2c,
there
was...
there
were
people
who
stood
up
in
both
houses
of
congress
and
suggested
that
this
law
would
not
be
enforced
in
states...
in
court
proceedings,
that
it
was
being...
that
it
was
addressing
itself
to
legislatures.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
there
it--
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
--i
think
it's...
i
think
it
is
difficult
to
know
why
they
passed
it,
there
being
no
reports--
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
--we
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
as...
as
was
noted
in
the
hanson
decision
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
i
think
there
was
gamesmanship
on
both
sides
in
both
houses.
gamesmanship
is
a
word
that
comes
from
the
hanson
case.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
it
is...
i
don't
know
that
they
have
enforced
2c.
i
think
most
of
them
have
believed
that
they
were
acting
under
this
court's
oversight
which
tells
courts
always
to
read...
always
to
do
single-member
districts
when
they
can.
but
it's
certainly
true,
justice
ginsburg,
no
court
since
1967
has
ordered
at-large
elections
in...
in
redistricting
cases.
but
we
believe
what...
if
you
look
at
the
rules
of
construction,
and
at
what
congress
actually
did,
without
trying
to
speculate
on
what
they
were
trying
to
do,
they
enacted
language
that
had
been
before
this
court
in
1911
and
was...
and
was
construed
in
1932
to
allow
at-large
elections.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
that
would...
and
that
is
a
difference
in
1911
because
those
two
parts
of
the
act
were
enacted
at
the
same
time.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
but
if
they
could
be
construed
consistently
in
1911,
then
i
think
they
can
be
construed
consistently
in
2002.
and
if
they
can
be
construed
consistently,
it
doesn't
matter
which
one
was
enacted
first.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
the...
the
difficulty
of
figuring
out
what
congress
thought
it
was
doing
on
this
single
piece
of
legislation
tacked
onto
a
private
immigration
bill
is
very
difficult,
justice
scalia.
i
recognize
it.
but
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
which
did
discuss
the
legislative
history,
they
had
thought
about
this
for
2
years
and
specifically
considered
repealing
the
1941
act,
and
they
didn't
do
it.
they
came
back
and
did
something
else.
and
we
think
under
standard
rules
of...
of
construction,
that
means
the
1941
act--
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
--i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
argue
that
congress
impliedly
repealed
a
1941
act
and
didn't
intend
to
pre-empt
a
state
law
that
said
the
same
thing.
i've
tried
to
come
up
with
that
argument,
justice
stevens,
but
i
don't
think
i
can
make
it.
[laughter]
so--
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
the...
the
answer
that
i
have
is
that
an
act
of
congress
is
not
subject
to
the
voting
rights
act,
and
would
be
enforced
on
its
face.
but
the
other
answer
i
have
is
this.
we
have
a
long
history
over
the
last
20
and
30
years
in
mississippi
of
coming
up
with
remedies
which
will
protect
the
rights
of
minority
voters.
the
most
common
remedy
since
gingles
is
to
do
single-member
districts,
but
it's
not
the
only
remedy.
and
there
are
remedies
where
you
can
elect
people
at
large
and
because
of
the
way
the
election
is
held,
all
people
running
together,
not
requiring
majority
votes,
not
having...
not
having
anti-single-shot
requirements,
those
have
worked
in
mississippi.
minorities
have
been
elected
in
white
jurisdictions
in
multi-member
races
by
using
those
sorts
of
procedures.
congress
didn't
tell
us
what
sort
of
procedure
to
use
in
an
at-large
election,
and
in
young
v.
fordice,
this
court
made
clear
that
whatever
procedures
you
use
would
have
to
be
precleared.
i
don't
think
the
legislature
will
act
for
all
of
the
reasons
we've
seen,
but
the
district
court
would
certainly
use
those
remedies.
they've
used
them
before.
minorities
will
be
protected.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
i
think
i
defend
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
as
far
as
it
went.
i
draw
a
distinction
between
this
case
and
growe
that
they...
they
simply
said
that
in
growe,
the
supreme
court
did
not
consider
this
issue,
which
is
true,
and
therefore
we
look
at
the
chancery
court.
it's
not
the
legislature.
it
can't
act.
there
is
a
distinction...
another
distinction
between
growe
and
this
case,
which...
which
the
district
court
did
not
dwell
on
and
we
dwell
on
in
our
briefs.
in
growe,
there
was
a
federal
claim
before
the
district
court...
before
the
state
court.
and
under
the
supremacy
clause,
ordinarily
a
state
court
must
litigate
federal
claims,
and
this
court
recognized
their
authority
to
do
so
in
growe.
here,
for
whatever
reason,
the
plaintiffs
in
the...
in
the
chancery
court
who
are
intervenors
in
this
court
did
not
assert
a
federal
claim.
they
made
it
quite
plain,
we
are
proceeding
only
under
state
law.
we
do
not
want
to
proceed
under
federal
law,
and
that
under
u.s.
v.
term
limits
simply
doesn't
exist.
there
is
no
federal...
there
is
no
state
law
claim
for
congressional
redistricting.
so
that's
the
difference
between
growe
and
this
case,
and
this
is...
that's
the
grounds
on
which
we
defend
it.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
there
is...
there
is
no
state
law...
first
of
all,
there
is
no
state
law
requiring
redistricting.
there
are
statutes
that
talk
about
how
the
legislature
proceeds,
but
there
is
no
substantive
law
that
says
redistricting
shall
take
place.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
it
is
under
no
duty
to
redistrict,
and
could
be
under
no
duty
to
redistrict
because
the
redistricting
requirement
comes
only
from
the
united
states
constitution.
the
authority
to
redistrict
comes
from
the
elections
clause,
and
the
state
of
mississippi
cannot
impose
on
their
legislators
any
requirement
having
to
do
with
congressional
redistricting.
a
decision
was
made
by
the
framers
over
200
years
ago
that
legislators
are
the
people
to
regulate
congressional
elections,
and
if
they
fail
to
do
it
in
their
job
of
representing
the
people,
then
congress
will
do
it
in
its
job
of
representing
the
people.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
because
at
that
point,
your
honor,
it...
it...
the...
perhaps
the
legislature
could
do
that.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
no,
i
don't
think
you
do,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
perhaps
they
could
delegate
authority.
if
the
legislature
said
this
problem
is
too
hard
for
us,
we
want
to
delegate
it
to
state
courts,
then
that...
that
issue
would
be
tested
like
any
other
delegation.
mr.
michael
b.
wallace
but
it...
but
when
you
are
dealing
with
federal
constitutional
guarantees
and
provisions,
you
do
not
always
take
the
state
courts
as...
as
gospel
even
on
state
law.
the
district
court
here
said
there
is
no
delegation,
and
as
your
honor
knows,
there
was
no
explanation
of
why
the
writ
of
prohibition
was
denied.
it
really
doesn't
set
much
of
a
precedent
for
anything,
but
the
district
court,
which
is
familiar
with
mississippi
law,
says
there
is
no
delegation
in
this
case.
we
have
looked
at
mississippi
law,
and
nothing
has
been
delegated.
so
the
question
of
whether
a
legislature
could
delegate
power
to
the
courts
is
not
here.
what
we
have
before
us
is
a
case
where
the
legislature
has
not
delegated
power
to
the
courts.
it
has
simply
done
nothing
and
when
it
does
nothing,
the
states
in
that
circumstance
are
powerless
to
act
if
we
go
back
to
the
acts
of
congress,
and
we
think
we
enforce
the
at-large
statute
from
1941
as
the
district
court
should
have
done.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
