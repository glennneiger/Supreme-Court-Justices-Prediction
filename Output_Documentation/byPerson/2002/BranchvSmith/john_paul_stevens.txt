justice
john
paul
stevens
the
court
will
hear
argument
in
number
01-1437,
branch
against
smith,
and
the
cross-appeal
of
smith
against
branch.
mr.
mcduff,
you
may
proceed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcduff,
can
i
ask
you
what
is
the
status
of
the
state
court
litigation?
is
there
an
appeal
pending
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
do
you
explain
the
failure
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
to
rule
on
that
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
are
two
questions
i
had.
first
of
all,
was
it
proper
for
the
district
court
to
decide
a
constitutional
issue
which
was
totally
unnecessary
to
support
its
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i...
i
take
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
state
court
would
have
to
make
the
same
constitutional
determination,
or
the
state
court
isn't
free
from
making
constitutional
determinations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
just
the
opposite.
it
has
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it's
part
of
the
injunction
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
course,
we
have
a
doctrine
that
we
don't
decide
constitutional
issues
unless
we
have
to.
do
you
think
that
doctrine
should
have
applied
to
the
district
court
in
this
case
because
the
section
5
ground,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
was...
was
self...
was
sufficient
to
sustain
the
objections?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
those
deadlines...
you've
demonstrated
in
your
brief
that
the...
the
clearance
hadn't
occurred.
i
mean,
if...
if
we
agree
with
your
position
on
the
preclearance,
the
deadlines
were
not
a
real
obstacle.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
mississippi's
own
default
rule?
doesn't
mississippi
have
that
same
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
wallace.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
wallace,
don't
you
agree
that
with
the
injunction
outstanding,
the
justice
department
would
have
the
same
reason
for
refusing
to
preclear
that
it's
already
given?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
you
say
it's
absolutely
correct
if
the
constitutional
reasoning
were
wrong,
and
if
they
say
we
won't
approve
a...
a
mississippi
plan
that
is
in
violation
of
our
constitutional
holding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
view
that
the
section
5
ground
of
decision
is
sufficient
to...
to
uphold
the...
the
injunction
below?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if...
if
that's
true,
did
not
the
district
court
violate
our
rule
against
deciding
constitutional
issues
unnecessarily?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
a
close
call
if...
if
the
judgment
is
clearly
correct
on
the
section
5
ground?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it's
only
a
close
call
if
you
think
there's
doubt
about
the
section
5
ground.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't...
says
you
don't
do
it
if
it's
not
necessary,
and
it
clearly
was
not
necessary
if
they're
right
on
the
section
5
ground,
which
everybody
seems
to
agree
they
were.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
do
you
agree
with
the...
with
mr.
feldman
that
in
any
event
the
mississippi
statute
is
out
of
the
picture
because
that's
pre-empted
no
matter
which
way
we
go
on
this
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
can
i
go
back
to
the
constitutional
issue
that
the
district
court
decided
in
this
case?
your...
your
adversaries
say
that
you
do
not
defend
the
reasoning
employed
by
the
district
court,
even
though
you
defend
their
judgment.
do
you
think
that's
a
fair
comment
on
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
there
is
no
state
law
requiring
redistricting
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
the
mississippi
legislature
is
under
no
duty
to...
to
redistrict?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
mcduff,
you
have
5
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
mcduff.
the
case
is
submitted.
