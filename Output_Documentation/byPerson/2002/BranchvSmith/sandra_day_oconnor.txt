now,
did...
did
mississippi
appeal
from
the
injunction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
could...
you
could
view
it,
i
guess,
if
you
had
to
look
at
it
at
all...
and
i'm
not
sure
we
do...
you
could
say
that
2a(c)
applies
before
a
plan
has
been
redistricted
in
the
manner
provided
by
state
law,
and
that
2c
applies
afterwards.
i
mean,
you
could
harmonize
them.
they've
been
in...
in
existence,
these
two
provisions,
for
a
very
long
time,
and
we
normally
don't
see
repealed
by
implication,
or
hold
that
there
is
such
a
thing--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
you
can
harmonize
them.
