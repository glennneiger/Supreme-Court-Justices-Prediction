mr.
james
a.
feldman
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
our
position
that
the
state
court
redistricting
plan
was
not
precleared
on
either
of
the
two
occasions
that
appellants--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--if
it's
clear
that
this
injunction
is...
rests
only
on
section
5
grounds,
and
not
constitutional
grounds,
that
certainly
would--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the...
what
the
injunction
actually
says
is
something
like
the
injunction
will
last
until,
and
unless
there
is
a
constitutional
plan
that's
precleared.
and
insofar
as
it
uses
the
word
constitutional,
and
we
know
the
views
of
the
district
court
about
that,
i
think
that
as
long
as
that...
that
word,
constitutional,
is
there,
that...
that
that
remains
an
obstacle
to
administering
the
plan.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
at
least
that
part...
at
least
the
injunction
has
to
be
modified
to
remove
the
word
constitutional.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
isn't--
it--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--if
the
court
made
clear,
i
think,
that...
that
the...
that
this
injunction
couldn't
rest
on
the
ground
that
article
i,
section
4
of
the
constitution
was
violated
by
the...
by
the
state
court
plan,
then
i
think
it
would
be
ripe
for
a
preclearance.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
if
a
state
moved
to
vacate
the
federal
court
injunction?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
in
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--there...
well,
there's
really
two
grounds
on
which
we
think
the
injunction
is...
is
relevant.
there's
a
narrower
ground,
which
i
think
it...
primarily
the...
the
argument
so
far
has
been
concerned
with,
which
is
that
the
state
was
no
longer
seeking
to
enforce
the
plan
because
it
didn't
appeal
it.
and
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--if
the
state
took
action,
they're
still
not
appealing
it,
but
i
suppose,
after
this
court's
order,
if
they
went
back
to
the
district
court,
and
said,
in
light
of
this
court's
order,
we're
trying
to
seek
to
enforce
it
again,
and
if
they
had
the
ability
to
do
that,
then
that...
then
that
would
be
eliminated.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
there
is
a
broader
ground,
however,
because
the...
insofar
as
the
injunction
is
a
injunction
that's
based...
rests
on
constitutional
grounds,
it's
the
department's
position
that...
that
the
preclearance...
the
section
5
uses
the
terms
seek
to...
seek
to
administer.
it
says
it
may
be
enforced
once
the
attorney
general
acts,
and
it
talks
about
voting
changes
that
are
in
force
and
effect.
and
all
of
those
things
point
to
a
contemplation
by
the
statute
of
a
change
going
to
the
attorney
general
when
it's
ready
to
be...
ready...
ready
to
go
into
effect,
when
there's
no
present
legal
obstacle.
as
long
as
there's
a
present
legal
obstacle
other
than
a
section
5
injunction
to
its
current
administration,
then
the
attorney
general...
it's
too
early...
it's
too
early
to
go
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think...
as
i
said,
i
think
it's
clear
that
if
the...
if
the
court
made
clear
that
this...
this
injunction
rests
on
section
5
and
doesn't
rest
on
the
proposition
that
it
violates
article
i,
section
4
for
the...
for
the
plan
to
go
into
effect,
then
it
would
be
ripe
for
a
preclearance
at
that
point.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think...
i
do
think
the
section
5
ground
was
sufficient
to
sustain
it.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
you
certainly...
the...
the
only
reason
i
would
hesitate
for
that,
before
i'd
quite
go
that
far,
is
district
court
was
faced...
if
you
put
yourself
in
the
situation
that
the
court
was,
with
very
tight
deadlines...
and
there
are...
even...
although
courts
should
avoid
deciding
constitutional
questions
when
possible,
there
may
be
some
extreme
circumstances
where--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
i
agree.
and
actually
i...
i
do
think
the
district
court
certainly
could
have
said
and...
and
perhaps
should
have
said,
this
is
a
constitutional
issue.
especially,
it's
a
novel
constitutional
issue
that
raises
novel
questions
that
haven't
been
addressed
before,
and
the
section
5
ground
was
sufficient
to
sustain
the
injunction.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
i
guess
only
insofar
as
when
you
read
the
actual
order
of
the
court,
it
says
a...
this...
this
shall
go
into...
the
state
may
not
enforce
the
state
court
plan
until
the
state...
there's
a
constitutional
plan
that's
precleared.
and
if
you
read
that
word--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
i
think
that
may...
that
may
well
be
right.
i...
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
i'd
like
to
go
to,
actually
the
first...
the
first
alleged
preclearance
which
is
supposed
to
have
occurred
60
days
after
the
plan
was
initially
submitted
to
the
district
court,
and
that
preclearance
did
not
occur...
was
initially
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
excuse
me.
that
preclearance
did
not
occur
because
on
february
14th,
before
the
60-day
period
had
expired,
the
attorney
general
sent
the
state
a
letter
saying,
i
need
more
information
before
i
can
preclear
this
plan.
that
procedure,
under
which
the
attorney
general
did
that,
was
specifically
held
valid
by
this
court
in
georgia
against
the
united
states,
and
the
court
in
georgia
specifically
held
that
that
stopped
the
60-day
clock
from
running.
later,
in
morris
against
gressette,
the
court
held
that
the
attorney
general's
substantive
determinations
under
section
5
are
not
subject
to...
are
not
subject
to
judicial
review
at
all.
and
therefore,
the
attorney
general's
determination
that
more
information
is
needed,
that
the
information
before
him
was
not
sufficient
to
permit
preclearance...
to
permit
him
to
make
the
determinations
he
had
to
make...
also
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
and
therefore,
because
that
whole
process
was...
was
approved
by
the
court
in
georgia
against
the
united
states,
because
more
information
was
sought,
that
that
terminated
the
60-day
clock
then,
and
it
did
not...
the
plan
was
not
precleared
some
days
later
when...
when
the
60-day
period
would
have
expired.
i
think
for
the
reasons
i
said
earlier,
it
also
was
not
precleared
at
the
later
period
both
because
the
state
didn't...
on
the
narrower
ground
that
the
state
did
not
appeal
the
injunction,
and
on
the
broader
ground
that
the
injunction
was
there.
and
the
section
5
process
is
designed
so
that
something
that's
ready
to
go...
the
attorney
general
should
reach
his
decision
on
an
act
that's
ready
to
take
effect.
finally,
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
go
to
the
statutory
question
of
the
interaction
of
sections
2c
and
2a(c).
with
respect
to
that
question,
it's
our
position
that
the
district
court,
as
a
remedy
here,
correctly
ordered
the
districting
of
mississippi's
congressional
delegation,
and
did
not
order
that
they
be
elected
at-large.
and
that
was
required
by
federal
law,
specifically
by
2
u.s.c.,
section
2c,
which
provides
that
there
shall
be
established
by
law
single-member
districts
in
each
state,
and
that
representatives
shall
be
elected
only
from
districts
so
established.
that
command,
it
seems
to
us,
is
unequivocal,
and
required
the
district
court,
when
it
was
faced
with
the
problem
of
what
to
do
about
mississippi,
to
create
single-member
districts.
it
would...
did
not
have
the
power--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
generally,
but
i
do
not
think
in
general
these
can
be
harmonized,
or
at
least
within
the
scope
of
where
it's
possible
for
2c
to...
to
operate.
for...
one
reason
is
that
the
language,
representatives
shall
be
elected
only
from
districts
so
established,
is
unequivocal,
and,
in
fact,
it
shows
that
the
earlier
portion
of
2c
that
says,
there
shall
be
established
by
law
congressional
districts
in
each
state,
has
to
mean
established
either
by
a
court,
or
by
a
legislature,
or
by
anyone
who
acts.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
they
do
have
the
same
statute,
which
we
would
view
as
pre-empted
by
section
2c.
but
that
was
the...
the
scheme
that
was
in
effect
in...
from
1941
to
1967.
the
reason
why
2c
was
enacted,
and
the
way
to
give
2c
some
effect
is
that
congress
at
that
time
was
faced
with
a
situation
where
there
were
at
least
six
courts
that
had
threatened
to
order
at-large
election
of
entire
congressional
delegations
in
the
aftermath
of
baker
against
carr.
and
congress
responded
to
that.
the
concern
specifically
was
that
courts
would
order
at-large
elections,
and
the
response
was
the
enactment
of
section
2c.
