this
argument's
probably
better
addressed
to
the
respondents
than...
than
you,
but
do
you
understand
the
respondents
to
argue
that
the
percentage
of...
of
milk
solids
which
is
one,
and
labeling,
which
is
the
second
part
of
the
statute,
simply
will
cease
to
exist
if...
if
this
pricing
regulation
is
not
upheld?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
thought
that
that
was
going
to
be...
when
i
got
into
the
case
i
thought,
well,
they're
going
to
say
that
it's
just
impossible
to
have
the
labeling,
but
i...
i
don't
understand
them
to
argue
that.
i
can
ask
them,
of
course,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just...
just
before
you
get
there...
well,
maybe
it's
a
part...
does...
do
nevada
producers
have
a...
a
federal
marketing
order?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
arizona
as
well?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they...
they...
do
they
opt
out
of
it
if
they
want
to
sell
the
milk
to...
to
california
producers,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
see,
and...
and
so
far
as
the
nevada
and
arizona
dairy
farmers
are
concerned,
they
can
sell
to
california
without
implicating
any
mechanisms
under
the
federal
marketing
order?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there...
but
there
was
no...
but
there
is
no
federal
marketing
order
that
supersedes
it,
or
am
i
wrong
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why
doesn't
that
resolve
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
i...
i
see.
in
other
words
it
would
have
to
be
a
california
marketing
order
treating
nevada
milk,
not...
not
a
nevada
marketing
order
saying
what
happens
when
you
go
to
california.
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in...
although
you
would
not
prevail
if
we
so
held.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
surely
we're
not
bound
by
shamrock
if...
if
we
consider
it
not
to
be
sound,
not
to
have
sound
reasoning.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i...
i...
and
i
must
say,
without
knowing
many
of
the
details
of...
of
the
pricing
scheme,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
labeling
and...
and
requirements
for
fortification
with,
i
guess,
nonfat
solids
can
exist
perfectly
well
without
your
pricing
scheme.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
if
that's
so
inevitable,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
been
in
7254.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it...
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
englert,
it
make...
does
make
a
certain
amount
of
sense
to
say
that
you
should
have
one
rule
of
construction
for
preemption
and
for
dormant
commerce
clause,
and
you
don't
have
two
different
rules
for
interpreting
congressional
intent
with
the
same
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were...
were
those
statutes
preemption
statutes
as
well?
you
see,
here
you
have
a
preemption
statute--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and...
and
the
argument
is
that...
but
let's
say
that
it
was
simply
a
preemption
case
that,
well,
directly
or
indirectly
congress
doesn't
want
have
to
spell
out
everything,
so
it
says
indirectly,
so
this...
so
this
is
not
preempted.
then
you
have
a
dormant
commerce
clause
and
you
say,
well,
we
have
a
different
rule
for
that.
that
seems
a
little
odd.
