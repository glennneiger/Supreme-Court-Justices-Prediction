thank

mcdowell.
mr.
urban,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
respond
to
your
adversary's
contention
that
when
you
use
the
word
construe,
congress
does
not
ordinarily
tell
this
court
how
to
construe
a
provision
of
the
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
certainly,
looking
over
a
large
group
of
statutes
that
congress
has
enacted,
there
may
be
something
to
what
you
say.
[laughter]
but
i...
i
do
think
the...
the
word
construed
is
simply
out
of
place
when
congress
is
saying
something
to
this
court
about
how
to...
how
to
interpret
the
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who's
your
authority
for
that,
for
the
extension
of
the
unmistakably
clear
principle?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
cases
would
be
what,
benjamin,
something
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
with
the
chalker
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
chief
office.
