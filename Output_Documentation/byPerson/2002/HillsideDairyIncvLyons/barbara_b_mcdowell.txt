ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
144
does
not
indicate
with
unmistakable
clarity
that
congress
meant
to
exempt
from
the
commerce
clause
any
california
laws,
much
less
to
exempt
the
particular
raw
milk
pooling
regulations
at
issue
here.
indeed,
section
144
is
most
naturally
read
as
protecting
only
a
narrow
set
of
california's
fluid
milk
composition
and
labeling
laws
from
invalidation
only
under
federal
statutes
and
regulations,
not
under
the
constitution.
first,
congress
did
not
state
or
even
imply
that
the
commerce
clause
is
among
the
provisions
of
law
from
which
section
144
provides
protection.
section
144
directs
how
those
provisions
of
law
shall
be
construed,
and
congress
ordinarily
does
not
direct
this
court
and
the
federal
courts
how
to
construe
the
constitution,
and
under
the
canon
that
general
words
are
known
by
their
more
specific
companions,
the
words,
any
other
provision
of
law
is
understood
to
refer
to
the
preceding
words,
this
act,
to
refer
only
to
federal
statutes
and
regulations
implementing
them.
section...
second,
section
144
protects
only
california
laws
regarding
two
specifically
defined
subjects,
the
percentage
of
milk
solids,
and
solid
not...
solids
not
fat
in
fluid
milk
products
sold
at
retail,
and
the
labeling
of
those
products.
the
laws
challenged
here
do
not
concern
either
subject.
they
instead
concern
how
california
handlers
account
to
the
california
equalization
pool
for
purchases
of
out-of-state
raw
milk
which
may
or
may
not
ultimately
be
processed
into
fluid
milk
products
subject
to
the
composition
and
labeling
requirements.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
this
specific
provision,
section
144,
applies
only
to
california.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
the
nutrition
and
labeling
act
does
contain
an
exemption
for
maple
syrup
composition
and
labeling
that
might
have
been
designed
to
benefit
the
particular
states
where
maple
syrup
is
produced.
i'm
not
aware
of
the
particular
background
of
that
provision.
there's
also
an
adjoining
provision
of
the
1996
farm
bill
that
provides
further
indication
that
congress
didn't
intend
section
144
to
apply
to
all
of
the
pricing
and
pooling
laws.
that's
section
143(b)
on
page
17
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
authorizes
the
promulgation
of
a
federal
milk
marketing
order
for
california
if
california
dairy
farmers
approve
of
one.
such
a
federal
milk
marketing
order
would
have
contained
its
own
separate
federal
pricing
and
pooling
provisions.
it
would
necessarily
have
superseded
the
california
pricing
and
pooling
provisions
at
issue
here.
it
seems
unlikely
that
congress
intended
in
section
144
to
preserve
the
very
pricing
and
pooling
laws
that
section
143(b)
and
the
federal
marketing
order
would
supersede.
the
legislative
history
reinforces--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--no,
it
authorized
the
promulgation
of
one
if
california
dairy
farmers
approved.
california
dairy
farmers
have
not
asked
for
a
federal
marketing
order
at
this
point.
under
a
federal
marketing
order,
by
the
way,
handlers
are
required
to
treat
milk
from
sources
inside
and
outside
the
marketing
order,
marketing
area
similarly,
so
the
same
minimum
pricing
requirements
that
would
apply
to
a
dairy
farmer
within
the
marketing
area
would
also
apply
if
milk
came
in
from...
from
outside
that
area.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
because
there...
there
is
no
federal
marketing
order
that
applies
to
california,
and
of
course
the--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
if
there
was
a
federal
milk
marketing
order
for
california,
milk
from
nevada
would
be
treated
the
same
as
milk
from
california.
of
course,
federal
milk
marketing
orders
aren't
subject
to
the
constraints
of
the
commerce
clause,
as
are
the
california
orders.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
and
this
is
a
particularly
unusual
commerce
clause
exemption
because
it
does
benefit
only
one
state.
it
seems
particularly
appropriate
in
that
circumstance
to
apply
the
clear
statement
rules
and...
and
to
require
an
affirmative
indication
that
congress
wanted
to
allow
california
and
only
california
to
burden
out-of-state
interests.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
certainly
one
of
the
most
familiar
instances
of
this--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--there
are
other
instances
in
which
congress
has
affirmatively
authorized
particular
action
by
states.
for
example,
the
northeast
bancorp
case
involved
a...
an
authorization
for
states
to
essentially
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
to
prohibit
acquisitions
of
local
banks
by
out-of-state
holding
companies,
and
when
congress
enacts
an
affirmative
authorization
one
would
think
that
then
congress
is
removing
any
impediments
that
congress
can
remove
from
state
regulation,
but
that's
not
the
forum
of
the
provision
at
issue
here.
rather,
it
applies
only
to
this
act
and
other
provisions
of
law
which
are
naturally
understood
to
be
federal
statutes
and
regulations.
with
respect
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
we
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
suggesting
that
a
statute
can
violate
that
clause
only
if
it
discriminates
on
its
face
based
on
citizenship
and...
or
residency.
in
chalker,
the
court
recognized
that
a
statute
could
also
violate
that
clause
if
it
discriminates
based
on
some
factor
closely
related
to
citizenship,
such
as
the
location
of
a
person's
chief
business
office.
the
distinction
drawn
by
the
california
regulations
are
somewhat
similar.
the
lower
courts
didn't
consider
whether
that
distinction
is
closely
enough
related
to
state
citizenship
to
implicate
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
accordingly,
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
be
reversed
with
respect
to
both
the
commerce
clause
and
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
question,
and
that
the
case
be
remanded.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
not
entirely
correct,
justice
stevens.
there
are
portions
of
other
states
that
are
not
included
in
federal
marketing
orders,
either,
i...
i
believe,
and
perhaps
the
entire
state
of
maine
is
not.
california
is
unique,
however,
in,
to
the
extent
that
it
has
its
own
freestanding
marketing
program
and,
of
course--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--california
is
the
largest
economy.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
the
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
privileges
and
immunities
question.
it's
a
narrow
question.
ultimately,
on
remand,
the
privileges
and
immunities
claim
may
not
have
to
be
decided
because
a
ruling
in
petitioners'
favor
on
the
commerce
clause
issue
would
provide
them
all
of
the
relief
that
they're
seeking.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
entire
case
needs
to
be
remanded
for
consideration
of
the
commerce
clause
claim
on
the
merits,
as
well
as
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
claim,
and
if
the
commerce
clause
question
is
decided
in
petitioner's
favor,
all
of
the
petitioners
would
benefit
from
that
ruling,
so
there
might
not
be
occasion
to
consider
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
as
well.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
