mr.
mark
j.
urban
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
distinct
and
separate
inquiries
in
construing
section
7254.
first,
does
it
create
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption
for
any
california
law,
and
second,
what
laws
are
within
the
scope
of
section
7254?
as
regards
the
first
step,
it
is
unmistakably
clear
that
congress
in
adopting
section
7254
intended
to
provide
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption
for
at
least
california's
milk
content
and
labeling
laws.
as
regards
the
second
step,
the
scope
of
section
7254
encompasses
not
just
the
milk
content
and
labeling
laws
themselves,
but
also
the
various
means
that
california
uses
to
continue
those
laws
in
effect.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
first
of
all,
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
statutes
the
court
found
that
there
was
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption.
in
that
case
they
used
the
term
construe.
second
of
all,
i
don't
know
that
congress
is
aware
of
the
niceties
of
the
difference
between
construe
and
interpret--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--or
it
would
have
used
both
of
those
words.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
but
beyond
that,
your
honor,
the...
they
then
say,
construe
to
preempt,
prohibit,
or
otherwise
limit.
if
they
want
to
delimit
the
scope
of
the
protection
of
section
7254
merely
to
preempt,
they
wouldn't
have
added
two
additional
phrases,
and
in
addition
to
that,
many
of
the
preemption
savings
statutes
use
the
term,
this
act
or
other...
any
other
act
of
congress,
or
lists
a
set
of
acts
or
regulations.
they
don't
simply
have
the
statement
of
one
act
and
then
a...
a
general
term
like,
any
other
provision
of
law.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there's
two
ways
the
congress
can
act
to
save
state
laws.
one
is
by
a
preemption
savings
statute,
and
the
other
is
by
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption.
and
beyond
that,
congress
can't
affect
the
state
exercise
of
authority
through
any
means
that
involves
the
constitution,
and
that,
the...
the
first
question
then
is,
does
section
7254
create
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption.
and
then,
as
i
indicated,
the
choice
really
is,
is
it
preemption
only
or
something
more
and
the
statute
itself,
by
using
the
terms,
prohibit
or
otherwise
limit,
suggests
that
it
is,
or
states
directly
that
it
is
something
more.
if
they
just
simply
wanted
to
have
this
as
a
preemption
savings
statute
they
would
have
stopped
at
preemption.
and
again,
the
argument
was
raised,
well,
why
didn't
they
mention
the
constitution
directly.
none
of
the
two
areas
where
there
have
been
cases
in
which
the
court
has
found
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption,
one
of
which
is
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
and
the
other
of
which
is
the
northeast
bancorp
case,
was
there
mention
of
the
constitution.
they...
they
looked
at...
at
the
total,
at
what
the
statute
said,
at
what
the
context
was
in
which
those
statutes
were
adopted,
and...
and
from
that
concluded
that
congress
had
intended
to
fully
regulate
in
those
areas
or
to
provide
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption.
the
petitioners
have
tried
to
use
a
doctrine
of
adjustum
generis,
the
laws
are
interpreted
in
the
company
they
keep.
i've
never
seen
an
application
of
that
doctrine
where
all
you
have
is
one
statute
or
one
item
mentioned,
and
then
you
say
any
others.
usually
that
doctrine's
applied
when
you
have
three
or
four
items.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
that...
that's
true,
your
honor.
that's
the
second
inquiry,
what
is
the
scope
of
the
statute,
and
they
are
distinct
inquiries,
and
it
would
be
possible
for
the
court
to
determine
that
the
statute
doesn't
cover
pooling
and
pricing
laws--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--and
still
protect
the
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption
from
milk
content
and
labeling
laws.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
we...
if
you
so
held,
we
would
be
back
to
the
district
court
on
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
dormant
commerce
clause
violation
for
the
milk
pricing
and
pooling
laws,
but
the
core
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
section
7254,
which
was
to
protect
and
allow
state
milk
content
and
labeling
laws
to
have
full
effect,
that
would
be
protected,
because
we
have
the
shamrock
farms
case
from
the
ninth
circuit
that
held
that
there
was
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption
created
for
those
laws.
i
want
to--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--what
was
directly
before
the
court
in
the
shamrock
case,
your
honor,
was
a
challenge
to
the
milk
content
and
labeling
laws,
and
then
the...
the
other
item
that
was
before
the
court
that
was
specific
was
the
fortification
allowance,
which
is
a
small
part
of
the
milk
pricing
and
pooling
laws,
and
then
there
was
a
general
allegation
involving
milk
pooling
and
pricing
that,
upon
which
there
was
an
admission
made
about
the
laws
being...
i
think
it
was
something,
interwoven.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
the
court
believes
that
there's
no
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption
at
all--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--your
honor,
as
a
general
matter,
you
can
have
composition
and
labeling
laws
without
a
pricing
scheme.
california's
composition
standards
are
unique
because
they
require
fortification.
that
produces
several
features.
one
is
that
there's
not
a
ready
market
to
sell
into
california
with
complying
milk.
if
you
didn't
have
pricing
and
pooling
laws
and
you
went
back
to
the
free
market,
you'd
be
subject
to
the
same
boom-bust
cycle
that
led
to
the
creation
of
these
pricing
and
pooling
laws
in
the
first
place,
and
when
you'd
reached
the
point
where
the
prices
were
very
high
and
supplies
were
low,
i
think
the...
the
inevitable
result
of
that
would
be
that
the
composition
standards
would
be
undone
and
they'd
simply
revert
to
the
federal
standards.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
i...
i
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
what
congress
did
in
7254,
and
this
goes
to
the
scope
of
the
statute,
is
that
they
protected
the
composition
and
labeling
laws
themselves,
and
they
also,
by
using
terms
like,
directly
or
indirectly,
establish
or
continue
in
effect,
regarding
rather
than
regulating,
referred
to
something
more,
and
that
something
more
are
the
means
that
california
uses
to
enable
the
laws
to
continue
in
effect.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
you
did,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
mark
j.
urban
the...
milk
is
an...
is
an
unusual
commodity
because
it
can't
be
stored,
and
like
any
commodity,
it's
subject
to
periods,
and
we
have
this
a
lot
with
agricultural
pricing,
where
you
have
periods
of
low...
you
have
high
supply
and
therefore
you'll
have
a
low
price.
people
leave
the
industry
and
then
the
cycle
will
reverse,
and
it's
when
you
reverse
the
cycle...
and
that's...
that
is
what
happened
with...
with
milk
that
led
to
the--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--formation
of
those
laws,
and
it's
also
what
occurs
frequently
with
agricultural
commodities.
i
mean,
they're...
they're
subject
to
a
boom-bust
cycle,
and
at
some
point
in
that
cycle
you're
going
to
have
prices
that
are
very
high,
and
we...
we've
had
that
happen
in
california
to
some
extent
for
other--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--other
reasons,
and...
and
you...
and
at
that
point,
and
it
did
happen
in
california
in
'99,
as
we've
cited
in
the
brief,
there
is
a
lot
of
pressure
to
undo
the
standards
because
they
are...
they
are
more
expensive
and
you'll
have
limited
supplies.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
the
connection.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
the
raw
milk
that
comes
to
a...
a
processing
plant
varies
to
some
extent
in
the
amount
of
fat
and
solids
not
fat.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
then
the
processor...
this
is
how
california's
processors
are
different
from
other
states'...
adds
in
solids
not
fat
in
order
to
meet
the
standards,
and
they
have...
you
know,
this
is
all
mechanized.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
correct.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
my
recollection
is
somewhere
around
10
to
15
percent,
most
of
which
comes
to
fluid
milk
plants,
which
are
the
class
1
plants.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
california's
prices
rise
and
fall
as
an
independent
market.
i
don't
know
what
happens
in
other
parts
of
the
united
states,
and
i
want
to...
aside
from
the
sort
of
economic
theory
of
the
boom-bust
cycle,
it
is
a
fact
that
california's
own
laws
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
pooling
and
pricing
laws
is
to
provide
supply
and
price
stability
in
order
to
allow
for
adequate
supplies
of
fluid
milk
at...
at
prices
that
are
reasonable
to
consumers,
and
that
the
purpose
of--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--that...
that's...
that
is
the
wrong
model.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
the--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--the
right
model
is
that
the...
the
prices
are
generally
set,
and
they're
recalibrated
regularly,
based
on
certain
free
market
markers,
like
various
cheese
exchanges,
et
cetera,
and
then
there
are
ways
for
each
of
the
prices
to
be
adjusted,
the
class
1,
class
2,
class
3,
class
4
prices
to
be
adjusted
so
that
they're...
they
reflect
in
a
sense
an...
a
open
market,
and
there's
also
a
desire
to
have
these
prices
be
comparable
to
the
prices
that
are
being
paid
on
the,
in
the
federal
marketing
orders
so
that
that
doesn't
produce
problems,
so
there's
not
a
subsidy
from
one
class
of
use
to
another
class
of
use.
what
there
was
was
then
a
blending
when
you
come
to
the
producers
of
their
revenues,
and
that's
the
pool,
and
that
blending
of
revenues,
they
adopted
a
two-tiered
system.
one
was
a
quota
system,
and
one
was
all
other
prices,
and
that
really
was
set
up
because
the
quota-holders
had
contracts
and
commercial
dealings
with
class
1
dealers
which...
for
which
they
got
a
higher
price,
and
the
goal
was
to
protect
those...
those
rights
and
reflect
those
rights
in
the
difference
between
a
quota
price
and
an
everything-else
price.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
that...
that's
exactly
right.
the
in-state
producers
are
regulated.
they
get
a
guaranteed
minimum
price.
out-of--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--right.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
they're
at
both
an
advantage
and
a
disadvantage.
they're
not
regulated,
so
they
have
the
disadvantage
that
they
don't
have
a
guaranteed
minimum
price,
but
they
have
the
advantage
that
they
can
compete
on
price,
so
if
they
want
to
be
efficient
and
undersell
california
producers
they
can
do
that,
so
they
have
both
a
benefit
and...
both
sides
have
a
benefit
and
burden.
one
is
of
regulation
versus
nonregulation.
i
want
to
go
into
the
legislative
history
of
section
7254,
which
was
mentioned.
when
section
7254
was
adopted,
the
federal
law
nlea
preempted
california
milk
content
standards,
but
that
law
only
applied
to
fluid
milk
in
interstate
commerce.
the
house
conference
committee
report
which
petitioners
cite
not
only
described
the
preemption
issue,
but
it
also
said
that
the
purpose
of
adoption
of
7254
was
to
allow
california
to
fully
enforce
and
apply
its...
its
standards.
it
would
have
made
little
sense,
in
light
of
that
congressional
intent,
for
congress
to
on
the
one
hand
allow
for
a
exemption
from
preemption
but
at
the
same
time
allowed
the
exact
same
body
of
law
to
be
subject
to
a
dormant
commerce
clause
challenge,
which
is,
in
fact,
what
happened
in
the
shamrock
case,
yet
that
would
occur,
that
undermining
of
congress'
intent
to
have
california
be
able
to
fully
enforce
its
own
milk
content
standards,
if
section
7254
were
held
to
be
only
a
preemption
savings
statute.
we've
touched
on
the
issue
of
the
scope
of
section
7254,
and
we're
not
claiming
that
the
unmistakable
clear
standard
applies
to
the
scope,
and
we're
certainly
not
claiming
that
it's
unmistakably
clear
that
section
7254
applies
separately
to
pricing
and
pooling
laws.
what
we're
claiming
is
that
section
7254
not
only
covers
the
laws
themselves,
but
the
means
to
keep
those
laws
in
effect,
and
in
answer
to
questions--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--that
it
doesn't
extend
to--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--first
of
all,
we
couldn't
find
a
single
case
where
the
court
has
come
back,
after
it's
determined
there's
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption,
for
example
with
the
business
of
insurance,
come
back
and
each
time
it
decides
what
is
the
business
of
insurance,
that
it
says
this
is
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption
so
we
have
to
use
an
unmistakably
clear
standard.
the
court
has
interpreted,
after
it's
found
a
general
area
of
law
that...
in
which
there's
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption,
that
it's
interpreted
then
what
is
within
that
area
of
the
law
using
standard
rules
of
statutory
construction,
and...
and--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--yes.
yes,
prudential
insurance
v.
benjamin,
but
then
when
the
court's
come
back,
for
example,
in
royal
drug
to
look
at
what's
the
business
of
insurance,
they've
used
standard...
you've
used
standard
rules
of...
of
statutory
construction.
and
you
know,
that...
that
makes
a
certain
amount
of
sense
here,
because
you
know,
you
have
both
a
preemption
savings
statute
and
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption
in
the
same
statute,
which
is
the
case...
if
you
have
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption
you'd
have
to
essentially
have
two
sets
of
rules
as
to
how
you
interpret
the,
what
is
being
affected
by
that...
that
exemption,
one
for
preemption
and
one
for
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption.
that...
that
doesn't...
doesn't
seem
logical.
they
should...
whatever
congress
intended
be
covered
by
the
law
should
be
interpreted
the
same,
whether
it's
a
commerce
clause
exemption
or
a
preemption
exemption.
the
second
issue
before
the
court
is
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
and
when
this
issue
was
considered
by
the
ninth
circuit
they
ruled
that
because
the
out-of-state
dairy
producers
were
not
being
regulated
based
on
their
residency,
but
that
the
regulatory
scheme
involved
place
of
production,
that
the...
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
didn't
apply.
that
is
fairly
unexceptional,
because
the
purpose
of
the
privilege
and
immunities
clause
is
that
it
applies
when
a
state
law
deprives
a
nonresident
who
enters
a
state
to
engage
in
some
protective
privilege,
that
they're
entitled
to
the
same
privilege
and
immunities
as
a
resident
of
that
state.
there's
no
entry
into
the
state
by...
by
the
dairy
farmers
from
arizona...
if
they
came
into
the
state
to
produce
milk,
they'd
be
treated
exactly
the
same
as--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--the
chalker
case
is
a
case
where
there's...
there
was
different
regulation
when
you
came
into
the
state.
there
was
a
tax
if
you
did
business
in...
you
came
into
tennessee
and
did
business.
there,
the
question
was,
they...
they
didn't
say
residency
per
se.
they
said--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--place
of...
yes,
chief
office
of
business,
and
i
think
the
court
correctly
found,
based
on
their
common
experience
and
knowledge,
that
that
was
simply
a
pretext
or
a
surrogate
or
a
proxy
for
residency.
that's
not
the
case
here.
here,
it's
a
shipment
of
goods,
milk
into
a
state.
it's...
it's
a
state
regulatory...
economic
regulatory
scheme,
essentially,
that's
affecting
the
goods
themselves,
and
that's
nothing
like
what's
happened
in
chalker.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
in
the...
in
the
context
of
the
statutes
that
they
had
before
them,
yes.
whether
that
is
a--
mr.
mark
j.
urban
--the
distinction
in
chalker,
what
was
the
discrimination
was
facial.
it
was
based
on
where
your
place
of...
of
business
was.
if
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
is
being
interpreted,
or
would
be
interpreted
to
say
that
if
you
had
some
transparent
proxy
for
place
of
residence,
like
they
did
in
chalker,
that
that
would
somehow
be
foreclosed
by
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
i
think
that
would
be
a
misreading
of
what
the
ninth
circuit
did.
they
took
a
statute
that,
as
they
indicate,
merely
regulated
based
on
place
of
production,
not
on
residency.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
in...
in
summation,
there...
the
two
issues
involving
the
section
7254
before
the
court
are
first
whether
it
establishes
an
exemption
and
second,
its
scope.
on
the
first
issue
we
believe
it's
unmistakably
clear
that
there
is
an
exemption
established
by
7254
to
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
as
to
the
second
issue,
we
believe
that
california's
milk
pooling
and
pricing
laws
are
within
the
scope
of
section
7254.
mr.
mark
j.
urban
thank
you.
