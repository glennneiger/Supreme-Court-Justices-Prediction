i
thought
the
only
thing
congress
had
ever...
maybe
there's
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
only
one
i...
only
one
i
know
of.
is
there
another
one?

of
course,
congress
is
sort
of
at
a
loss
for
words,
because
it...
it's
only
the
commerce
clause...
that's
the
only
provision
of
the
constitution
that
congress
can
instruct
us
not
to
apply,
so
it's
understandable.
maybe
out
of
respect
for
the
rest
of
our
body
of
law
they...
they
might
use
the
word
construe,
right?
i
mean,
we
don't
have
any
other
examples
of
where...
unless
it
was
the...
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act,
which...
which
we
did
not
uphold.
