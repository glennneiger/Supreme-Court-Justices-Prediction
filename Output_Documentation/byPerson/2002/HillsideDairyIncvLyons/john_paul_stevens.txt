justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
it
was
only
insurance
that
congress
had
performed
the
extraordinary
act
of
waiving
the
commerce
clause.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
just
one
factual
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
in
thinking
california
is
the
only
state
that
does
not
have
a
federal
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
its
own,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
my
other
question
is,
do
you...
does
the
government
think
we
have
to
reach
the
privilege
and
immunities
issue
to
decide
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
urban,
the
problem,
as
i
see
it,
is
not
whether
they...
you
might
construe
the
language
as
broad
enough
to
cover
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
but
the
thing
it
saves
is,
legislation
regarding
milk
solids
and
fats
and
so
forth,
and
doesn't
say
anything
about
saving
pricing
legislation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask,
though,
are
the...
the
percentage
of
solids
in
the...
in
the
milk,
is
that
something...
that's
something
that's
not
determined
by
the
farmer.
that's
determined
by
the
processor,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
done
even
if
the
milk
when
it
left
the
farm
was
deficient
in
fat
solids.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
california
legislature
has
created
a
milk
marketing
structure
that
requires
that
the
prices
for
milk
produced,
processed,
or
sold
in
california
by
creating
an
equalization
pool
that
in
essence
shifts
revenue
from
processors
of
high
value
milk
products
to
processors
or
low-value
milk
products.
in
1997,
california
changed
its
marketing
structure
to
require
the
contributions
to
this
equalization
pool
be
made
on
some
out-of-state
purchases.
petitioners
are
out-of-state
milk
producers
that
challenge
this
law
on
the
grounds
that
it
violate
the
dormant
commerce
clause
and
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
district
court
did
not
reach
the
merits
of
these
cases
but
dismissed
them
both.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
holding
that
a
federal
statute
enacted
in
1996
had
immunized
california's
milk
pricing
and
pooling
laws
from
commerce
clause
challenge
and
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
claim
failed
because
of
the
1997
amendments
did
not,
on
their
face,
create
classifications
based
on
citizenship.
today,
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
federal
statute
at
issued
covers
california
laws
regulating
the
composition
and
labelling
of
fluid
milk
but
does
not
clearly
express
any
intent
to
insulate
california's
milk
pricing
laws
from
commerce
clause
challenge.
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
erred
in
relying
on
this
federal
statute
to
dismiss
the
commerce
clause
challenge.
with
respect
to
petitioner's
privileges
and
immunities
clause
claim,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
absence
of
an
expressed
statement
in
the
california
statute
discriminating
on
the
base
of
citizenship
to
bar
petitioner's
claim.
that
holding
however
is
inconsistent
with
the
decision
of
this
court,
the
case
decided
back
in
1919.
but
on
expressing
an
opinion
on
the
merits
of
the
previleges
and
immunities
claim,
we
find
that
the
absence
an
expressed
statement
regarding
citizenship
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
rejecting
this
claim.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
these
two
cases
are
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
