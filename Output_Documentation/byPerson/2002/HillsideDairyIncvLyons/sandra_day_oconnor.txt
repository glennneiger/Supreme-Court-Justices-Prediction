--well,
is
it
true
that
the
pricing
and
pooling
laws
were
adopted
to
help
the
milk
producers
comply
with
the
fluid
milk
content
provisions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
what
the
attorney
in
the
shamrock
case
conceded.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
agree?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
section
7254
does
use
the
word
indirectly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
the
court
below
didn't
deal
with
the
privileges
and
immunities
issue,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
generally
speaking,
what
percentage
of
the
raw
milk
comes
in
from
out
of
state
to
california,
of
the
total?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it's
generally
a
small
percentage.
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
i
think
that
you're
dire
consequences
scenario
would
play
out.
do
milk
prices
tend
to
rise
and
fall
over
a
wide
region
of
the
united
states
at
the
same
time,
or
does
it
tend
to
be
very
spotty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
true
that
in-state
producers
of
raw
milk
are
guaranteed
a
minimum
price
for
their
milk
under
the
california
scheme,
but
out-of-state
producers
are
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
the
out-of-state
producers
are
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they're
at
a
disadvantage
to
that
extent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
support
the
ninth
circuit's
view
that
to
be
covered
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
it
has
to
be
facially
discriminatory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i...
i
would
have
thought
that
broad
statement
was
not
accurate
in
light
of
chalker,
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
facially
discriminatory
to
be
covered.
