mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
of
inventive
statutory
interpretation
by
the
ninth
circuit.
the
statute
at
issue
directs
the
courts
how
to
construe
this
act
or
any
other
provision
of
law,
yet
the
ninth
circuit
interpreted
the
statute
rather
inventively
as
an
exemption
from
a
provision
of
the
constitution.
the
statute
protects
california
statutes
and
regulations
regarding
two
aspects
of
california's
composition
regulation
of
packaged
fluid
milk,
yet
the
ninth
circuit
interpreted
the
statute,
rather
inventively,
as
an
exemption
for
all
aspects
of
california's
economic
regulation
of
raw
milk.
inventiveness
may
have
a
role
to
play
in
some
cases
of
statutory
interpretation,
but
not
when
the
governing
legal
standard
requires
that
congress
has
made
its
intent
unmistakably
clear.
the
ninth
circuit's
statutory
holding
should
be
reversed.
there
is
also
a
constitutional
issue
before
the
court
involving
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
article
4.
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
reversed
on
that
issue
as
well,
but
not
because
it
was
overly
inventive.
the
ninth
circuit
simply
ignored,
with
no
explanation
at
all,
binding
precedent
from
this
court
requiring
that
courts
look
beyond
the
face
of
the
statute
to
determine
whether,
in
practical
effect,
it
draws
a
distinction
based
on
citizenship
or
residency.
the
california
statutes
and
regulations
at
issue
in
this
case
draw
a
distinction
based
on
where
milk
is
produced,
and
93
percent
of
dairy
farmers
live
on
their
farms.
to
draw
a
distinction
based
on
the
state
of
production
is,
in
effect,
to
draw
a
distinction
based
on
the
state
of
residency,
and
the
distinction
should
be
subject
to
scrutiny
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
we
do
not--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--only
the
individual
petitioners
are
entitled
to
invoke
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
yes,
and
there
are
individual
petitioners.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
a...
a
husband
and
wife,
darrel
and
diane
kuiper,
yes.
let
me
return
to
the
statutory
issue.
this
act
or
any
other
provision
of
law
in
section
144
means
statutory
or
regulatory
law,
not
the
constitution.
why
do
i
say
that?
number
1,
section
144
is
phrased
as
a
directive
to
courts
about
how
to
construe
particular
bodies
of
law.
congress
doesn't
have
the
power
to
tell
courts
how
to
construe
the
constitution.
it
does
have
the
power
to
tell
courts
how
to
construe
congressional
silence
or
inaction,
and
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
is
a
good
example
of
the
kind
of
phraseology
congress
uses
when
it
wants
to
enact
a
commerce
clause
exemption,
but
section
144
is
a
poor
candidate
from
the
outset.
number
2,
the
canons
of
construction
applied
in
numerous
decisions
of
this
court,
most
recently
the
keffler
case
in
february,
required
that
a
general
phrase
like,
other
provision
of
law,
be
construed
by
reference
to
the
phrases
that
came
before.
federal
statutory
and
regulatory
law
is
naturally
paired
with
this
act,
but
would
be
very
odd
to
throw
the
constitution
in
as
an
afterthought
through
use
of
the
phrase,
other
provision
of
law.
number
3,
the
legislative
history
is
devastating
to
respondents'
position.
the
absence
of
a
single
reference
to
the
constitution
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
is
quite
significant,
but
it's
not
the
strongest
refutation
of
respondents'
argument
in
the
legislative
history.
rather,
the
very
first
paragraph
of
explanation
of
section
144
in
the
conference
report
describes
it
as,
quote,
an
exemption
from
the
preemption
provisions
of
any
federal
law
respecting
standards
of
identity
and
labeling
for
fluid
milk,
close
quote.
that
can
be
found
on
page
33
of
the
blue
brief.
number
4,
and
this
is
merely
the
clincher
that
builds
on
the
first
three
points,
the
standard
is
whether
congress
has
been
unmistakably
clear
in
passing
a
commerce
clause
exemption.
the
evidence
is
so
strongly
the
other
way
that
one
might
call
it
unmistakably
clear
that
congress
did
not
pass
a
commerce
clause
exemption,
but
it--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
that...
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
their
contention.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i...
i
don't
understand
them
to
argue
that
either,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
the
strongest
form
their
argument
takes
is,
there
is
a
relationship
between
economic
regulation
of
raw
milk
and
compositional
regulation
of
packaged
fluid
milk,
and
any
relationship
is
enough
to
satisfy
this
statute.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i...
i
don't
think
that's
factually
accurate,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
not...
not--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor.
he
did
not
concede
that.
what
he
did
concede
was
that
the
fortification
allowance--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--which
is
a
particular
provision
of
the
stabilization
plan,
that
is
the
pricing
plan,
not
the
pooling
plan,
was
adopted
to
help
compliance
with
california's
composition
standards.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it
does,
your
honor,
but
it's
very
interesting
to
look
at
the
parallel
phrasing
of
section
144
of
the
farm
bill,
7
u.s.c.
7254,
and
the
preemption
provision
of
the
nutrition
labeling
and
education
act,
which
is
21
u.s.c.
section
343-1.
both
use
the
phrase
directly
or
indirectly.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
in
the
preemption
provision
of
the
nlea,
congress
was
talking
about
was...
what
was
preempted,
and
it
was
saying
anything
a
state
does
directly
or
indirectly
to
have
labeling
requirements
different
from
federal
law
is
preempted.
what
section
144
of
the
farm
bill
does
is,
it
unpreempts
california's
standards
for
milk.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
now,
unless
california
is
prepared
to
say
that
it's
entire
pooling
and
pricing
plans
were
preempted
by
the
nlea
in
1990,
which
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
hear
from
mr.
urban,
the
entire
pooling
and
pricing
plans
weren't
unpreempted
by
section
144
of
the
farm
bill,
either.
let
me
turn
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
issue.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
nevada,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
sales
to
california...
or,
to
california
processors,
excuse
me,
are
not
regulated
by
those
milk
marketing
orders.
the...
the
seller
and
the
buyer
would
both
have
to
be
within
the
marketing
order
for
it
to
be
governed
by
the
federal
milk
marketing
order,
i
believe.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
oh,
it
did
actually,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it
affirmed
the
rule
12(b)(6)
dismissal.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it's
on
page
a14--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--of
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
and
its
only
reasoning
was,
the
statutes
and
regulations
do
not,
on
their
face,
refer
to
citizenship
or
residency.
the
controlling
precedent
that
absolutely
precludes
that
reasoning
is
the
chalker
case
from
this
court
in
1919,
and
respondents
frankly
have
not
even
made
an
argument
for
why
chalker
should
be
overruled.
our
own
submission
is
that
the
84
years
since
chalker
was
decided
have
strengthened
its
underpinnings
a
great
deal,
rather
than
undermining
them.
the
camden
case
from
1984
reinforces
chalker
by
rejecting
a
formalistic
approach
to
the
threshold
question
of
discrimination,
and
the
lunding
case
from
just
5
years
ago
stresses
the
concern
with,
quote,
practical
effect,
close
quote,
in
this
court's
privileges
and
immunities
clause
jurisprudence.
there's
just
nothing
to
justify
the
ninth
circuit's
disregard
of
this
court's
cases.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
court
has
said
very
consistently
in
its
dormant
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
that
the
intent
of
the
congress
must
be
unmistakably
clear.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
in...
in
some
instances,
they
were.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
that's
what
the
court
did
in
new
england
power
company
v.
new
hampshire,
and
the
statute
being
construed,
the
provision
of
the
federal
power
act
being
construed
in
that
case,
like
the
statute
being
construed
in
this
case,
was
not
so
much
a
preemption
clause
as
an
unpreemption
clause.
the
typical
statute
that
comes
before
this
court
alleged
to
be
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption
is
one
that
says
certain
state
laws
are
protected,
or
are
allowed,
and
in
many
of
those
cases
the
court
has
said,
and
new
england
power
v.
new
hampshire
is
a
good
example,
the
court
has
often
said
yes,
those
state
laws
are
not
subject
to
preemption
under
federal
law,
but
there
is
no
unmistakably
clear
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption.
so
the...
the
court's
jurisprudence
as
i
read
it
is
really
rather
consistent
in
setting
a
higher
standard
for
exemptions
for
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
and
there's
a
reason
for
that,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
commerce
clause
is
part
of
the...
is
one
of
the
structural
provisions
of
the
constitution
and,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
south-central
timber
case,
the
particularly
strong
rule
of
construction
ensures
that
all
states
know
what's
going
on
and
have
their
say
in
congress
before
the
protections
the
states
have
vis-a-vis
one
or
another...
vis-a-vis
one
another
are
altered.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it's
all
true.
it's...
it's...
but
it
was
just
as
much
of
a
sin
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
ignore
the
93
percent
correlation
between
where
dairy
farmers
reside
and
where
milk
is
produced
as
it
was
to
say,
we
don't
look
beyond
the
face
of
the
statute.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it's...
it's
exactly--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i...
i'm
not
making
that
broad
an
argument,
justice
breyer.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
in
this
case,
as
in
the
chalker
case,
there
is
an
extremely
high
correlation
between
place
of
business
and
residency
or
citizenship
of
individuals,
and
just
as
this
court
said,
we
don't
care
that
someone
from
alabama
could
have
a
principal
place
of
business
in
tennessee,
because
most
people
from
alabama
don't
have
a
principal
place
of
business
in
tennessee--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--so
too,
here,
the
ninth
circuit
should
not
have
cared
that
nevadans
could
have...
could
produce
milk
in
california
when
93
percent
of
all
dairy
farmers
do
produce
milk
in
the
state
and,
indeed,
on
the
very
farm
where
they
reside.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i...
i
certainly
suspect
it's
a
violation,
but
we're
we're
not
asking
this
court
actually
to
hold
that
there's
any--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--privileges
and
immunities
violation.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
just
that
there
should
be--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--substantive
constitutional
scrutiny.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
give
this
case
any
substantive
constitutional
scrutiny.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
right,
but
on...
on
both
issues,
justice
breyer,
the
ninth
circuit
declined
to
engage
in
any
substantive
analysis--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--with
respect
to
the
dormant
commerce
clause
on
the
erroneous
ground
that
it
was
unmistakably
clear
that
there
was
a
commerce
clause--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--exemption,
and
with
respect
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
on
the
ground
that
location
is
not
the
same
as
residency
or
citizenship,
and
we
need
not
look
behind
location
of
production
to
ask
whether
it
is
so
closely
correlated
with
residency
or
citizenship
as
to
create
an
improper...
a
classification
that
must
be
scrutinized
under
the
constitution.
mr.
urban
pointed
out
that
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
uses
the
verb
construe,
and
rightly
so,
but
what
it
says
the
court
is
not
to
construe
as
forbidding
state
regulation
is
congress'
silence.
it
is
not
a
directive
how
to
construe
the
constitution.
it
is
a
very
proper
statute,
perhaps
the
model
for
how
a
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption
should
be
written.
don't
construe
our
silence
to
mean
we
want
to
stop
the
states
from
doing
something.
the
statute
here
is
very
different.
the
statute
here
says,
construe
this
act
or
any
other
provision
of
law
in
particular
ways.
mr.
urban,
in
talking
about
section
7254,
said
at
one
point,
the
use
of
three
different
verbs,
only
one
of
which
is
preempts,
suggests
that
congress'
intent
was
something
more
than
merely
to
negate
federal
preemption.
i
respectfully
submit
that
suggesting
that
congress
had
more
in
mind
is
not
enough
to
meet
the
unmistakable
clarity
standard.
under
gregory
v.
ashcroft,
an
unmistakable
clarity
standard
means
it
would
be
plain
to
anyone
reading
the
act
what
congress
had
in
mind,
and
merely
saying
the
use
of
three
verbs
suggests
something
does
not
make
it
plain
to
anyone
reading
the
act.
i
do
think...
justice
stevens
asked
ms.
mcdowell
if
the
court
needs
to
reach
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
claim.
i...
i
believe
the
court
does
need
to
reach
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
claim
in
the
limited
way
we
have
suggested
and
that
is
because,
although
ms.
mcdowell
correctly
said
the
petitioners
might
prevail
on
remand
under
the
commerce
clause
and,
indeed,
i
hope
we
will,
and
if
we
do
that
will
give
all
of
my
clients
the
relief
that
they
need,
we
also
might
not
prevail
under
the
commerce
clause,
and
i
think
we're
entitled
to
pursue
both
the
commerce
clause
claim
and,
with
respect
to
the
individual
petitioners,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
claim
on
remand.
the...
justice
kennedy
asked
me
some
questions
in
my
opening
argument
about
the
federal
marketing
orders
in
effect
in
nevada
and
arizona,
and
i...
i
perhaps
didn't
speak
with
sufficient
clarity
about
two
aspects
of
that.
the
federal
milk
marketing
orders
cover
parts
of
nevada
but
not
other
parts.
some
are
and
some
are
not
covered
by
federal
milk
marketing
orders,
but
in
any
event,
it's
worth
making
clear
that
the
marketing
orders
fundamentally
operate
on
the
processors
of
milk,
not
on
the
producers
of
milk,
so
when
we
say
the
federal
milk
marketing
orders
operate
in
parts
of
nevada,
we're
really
talking
about
nevada
processors.
if
you
ship
your
milk
to
a
california
processor
it...
it
is
at
no
point
governed
by
a
federal
milk
marketing
order.
whatever...
with
respect
to
the
unmistakably
clear
standard,
mr.
urban
made
the
argument
that
once
you've
found
an
unmistakably
clear
dormant
commerce
clause
exemption,
the
unmistakably
clear
standard
has
no
more
role
to
play
and
it's
just
a
matter
of
ordinary
statutory
interpretation.
this
court's
cases,
i
believe,
do
not
support
that
proposition,
but
he
spoke
specifically
about
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
cases
in
which
the
court
has
construed
the
phrase,
business
of
insurance,
without
any
particular
thumb
on
the
scale.
well,
that
is
how
the
court
must
construe
the
phrase,
business
of
insurance,
because
congress
has
delegated
authority
over
an
entire
business
to
the
states.
that's
very
different
from
this
very
precisely
drawn
statute
that
speaks
about
two
particular
aspects
of
california's
compositional
regulation
of
raw
milk
and
saying,
well,
let's
just
resort
to
ordinary
principles
of
statutory
interpretation
to
determine
whether
that
also
reaches
economic
regulation
of
fluid
milk.
the
unmistakably
clear
standard
is
still
in
effect,
and
ingenious
arguments
about
the
relationship
between
economic
regulation
of
fluid
milk
and
composition
regulation
of
raw
milk
are
not
enough
to
meet
that
standard.
in
particular,
it
cannot
possibly
be
the
case
that
the
1997
amendments
to
california's
pooling
plan
are
somehow
necessary
to
effect
composition
regulation.
the
main
thing
the
1997
amendments
did
was
not
negate
the
possibility
that
out-of-state
milk
would
flood
california
to
such
an
extent
that
there
would
be
price
effects
that
ultimately
would
have...
would
have
sanitary
effects.
what
the
1997
amendments
did
essentially
was
say,
we're
going
to
intercept
some
of
the
revenue
that
would
otherwise
go
to
out-of-state
processors
at
california's
border
and
redistribute
it
just
to
in-state
interests.
we're
going
to
take
some
of
the
money
that
they
would
otherwise
get
in
their
milk
transaction
and
say,
it
must
go
to
californians,
not
to
you
out-of-staters.
that's
the
essence
of
the
commerce
clause
violation
in
this
case,
and
it's
also
inconceivable
that
that
kind
of
regulation
could
be
protected
by
this
statute.
if
that
kind
of
regulation
is
protected
by
this
statute,
then
a
regulation
that
says
100
percent
of
every
milk
check
that
would
be
written
to
a
nevadan
must
instead
go
to
a
californian
is
protected
by
this
statute,
i.e.,
no
out-of-state
milk,
and
that
can't
possibly
be
the
unmistakably
clear
intent
of
congress
in
section
7254.
one
last
detail,
and
it
is
just
a
detail.
mr.
urban
said
that
10
to
15
percent
of
the
milk
that
comes
into
california
is
from
out
of
state.
i
understand
from
a
publication
that's
cited
at
page
39
of
our
opening
brief
called
dairy
profit
weekly
that
the
actual
number
is
closer
to
3
percent.
when
congressman
bill
thomas
spoke
at
a
field
hearing...
thank
you.
