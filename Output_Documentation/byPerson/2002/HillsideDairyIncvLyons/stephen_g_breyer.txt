justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
federal--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
an
ingenious
argument,
but
i
mean,
if
i
understand
it
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
we...
if
you
didn't
have
the
price
controls,
then
competition
would
break
out,
and
competition
breaking
out
would
mean
in...
if
we
were
back
in
the
thirties,
that
eventually
everybody
would
go
out
of
business
but
for
one
giant
milk
seller
who
then
would
raise
the
price
so
high
that
the
people
really
getting
angry
at
him,
as
opposed
to
only
paying
$18,
which
is
considerably
above
the
market
level,
they
might
have
to
pay
$24,
even
more.
they'd
really
get
angry,
and
this
time,
though
they
don't
get
angry
at
the
$18
price,
they'd
start
really
shipping
milk
in
from
arizona,
and
once
they
shipped
in
milk
from
arizona,
maybe
that
wouldn't
have
the
fortified
stuff
in
it
and
they'd...
they'd
amend
the
law
so
that
you
could
bring
it
in
from
arizona
and
down
would
go
the
labeling
requirement
as
it
stands
today.
do
i
understand
the
argument
correctly?
i've
parodied
a
little,
but
i
don't
think
i've
parodied
it
that
much.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
did.
yes,
i
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how...
how
does
the
latter
part
come
in?
i
mean,
if
we
have
to
write
this,
as
i
understand
it,
and
i'd
just
as
soon
you
correct,
because
i
don't
want
to
say
something
if
it
isn't
right.
this
is
actually
a
simple
system,
it's
not
so
complicated,
and
at
the
heart
of
it
is
simply,
we
could
pretend
that
they
want
to
pay
the
dairy
$16
a
hundredweight
indefinitely.
that's
stable.
and
now
the
problem
is,
although
you
can
say
to
everybody,
pay,
a
handler
is
paid
$16,
when
they
do
that
they're
going
to
discover
cheese
coming
in
from
wisconsin,
and
the
cheesemakers
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
compete
and
still
pay
$16,
so
they
figured
out
in
california,
here's
how
we
keep
our
cheesemakers
in
business.
we
subsidize
them.
we
pay
them
$2
because
they
can
only
sell
at
$14.
where
do
we
get
the
money
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
pay
$18
to
pay
the
cheesemakers
$14
so
that
all
can
pay
$16
to
the
dairies.
that
way,
the
cheesemakers
stay
in
business
despite
wisconsin,
and
the
milk
sellers,
unfortunately
the
retailers
have
to
charge
more
and
the
mothers
have
to
pay
more
for
their
milk,
but
that
in
a
way
helps
the
people
who
want
to
eat
a
lot
of
cheese.
we
don't
know
what
happens
to
them
if
they
eat
too
much
cheese,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
we
are.
but
i
mean,
that
seemed
to
me
the
essence
of
the
system,
and
since
that's
the
model
that's
in
my
mind,
and
since
it
could
become
relevant,
i'd
like
you
to
correct
me
if
i'm
not
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
is
the
right
model?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
two
sentences...
i
hadn't
understood
that.
they
wrote
two
sentences
on
this
in
the
opinion,
and
you're
saying
it's
really
the
first
sentence
that
is
the
holding,
that
there
is
no
violation
with
respect
to
the
individual
dairy
owners
because
the
classifications
the
pooling
plan
amendments
create
are
based
on
the
location
where
milk
is
produced,
and
the
next
sentence
is
sort
of
a
throw-away,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
to
the
contrary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
how
you...
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
answer
to
the
last
point
on
privileges
and
immunities?
i
hadn't
taken
that
in,
and
i...
i
think
it's
been
argued
on...
on
your
side
as
if
what
the
court
had
said
was,
well,
the
statute
doesn't
create
a
classification
on
its
face,
doesn't
create
a
classification
based
on
an
individual's
residency
or
citizenship,
which
certainly
it
doesn't,
and
then
you
say
quite
right,
but
of
course
a
statute
nonetheless
could
do
that
in
effect,
and...
and
thereby
have
the
same
violation
that
it
would
have
had
if
it
had
been
on
its
face,
but
that
isn't
their
point,
and
as
i
reread
this
they're
saying...
i
think
it
does
say
what
they
say
it
said.
what
the
judge
was
saying
is,
wait
a
minute,
there...
there's
no...
nobody
here
could
say
they're...
they're
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
residency
or
citizenship.
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
it's
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
where
the
milk
is
produced.
we
don't
care
if
he's
a
california
resident
or
a...
or
an
alaska
resident,
it's
where
the
milk
is
produced,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
as
i
read
it,
says
the
judge,
i.e.
on
its
face,
that
says
anything
to
the
contrary.
now,
what's
the
answer
to
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see,
you're
saying
it
might
violate
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
even
if...
or,
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
what...
it's
a
violation
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
for
a
state
to
discriminate
against
out-of-state
commerce,
because
after
all,
out-of-state
commerce
is
mostly
produced
by
out-of-state
residents?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
massachusetts
passes
a
statute...
you
know
this
area
better
than
i
at
the
moment,
but
if
massachusetts
passes
a
statute
and
it
says,
we're
fed
up
with
nectarines
from
california,
they're
too
woolly,
and
therefore
no
more
nectarines
from
california
coming
into
massachusetts,
it's
absolutely
true,
every
nectarine
farm
down
there
is
owned
by
a
california
resident,
none
by
massachusetts
residents.
that
violates
the
privileges
and
immunities
provision,
in
your
opinion,
as
far
as
individuals
own
the
farms?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i
know
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that,
but
there's
nothing
to
the
contrary--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
well,
that's
primarily
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
i'm
more
familiar
with
the
privileges
and
immunity
clause
argument.
i'm
less
familiar
with
how
courts
in
this
area--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i...
i
understand.
