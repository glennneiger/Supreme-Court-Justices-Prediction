justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could...
you
could
read
that,
couldn't
you...
you...
you
argue
that
to
accept
your...
to
respondent's
view
would
mean
the
savings
clause
has
no
work
to
do,
but
the
savings
clause
could
still
be
for
cases
of
negligent...
negligent
operation,
for
cases
in...
of
negligent...
negligence
in
manufacturing
a
piece
of
equipment.
so
there...
there
would
be...
on
any
reading
of
this,
there
would
be
something
saved.
so...
so
you...
i
think
you
have
to
modify
your
argument.
the
savings
clause
would
be
nullified.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
basis
of
one
jury
verdict?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
like
in
tort
actions
in
general.
i
don't
see
how
you
get
from
one
jury
verdict,
that
that
becomes
the
positive
law
of
the
state,
that
you
must
have
a
propeller
guard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
the
coast
guard
itself
didn't
find
anything.
it
said
we're
not
making
the
standard
now.
as
counsel
for
petitioner
pointed
out,
there
is
no
formal
action.
there's
just
non-action
by
the
coast
guard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
were
still
watching
it.
they
didn't
make
a...
a
determination
that
propeller
guards
are
dangerous,
therefore
should
not
be
used.
they
said
we're
still
keeping
this
under
advisement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
something
that's
published,
that's...
that's
a
formal
kind
of
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
shapiro,
in...
in
this
very
setting,
the
coast
guard
said,
when
this
boat
safety
act
was
new,
states,
until
we
get
around
to
doing
this,
your
law
controls.
so
there
must
have
been
some
scope
for
state
law
regulating
equipment
that
was
there
for
the
coast
guard
to
say,
it
will
take
us
time
to
get
our
regulations.
in
the
meantime,
state
law
applies.
so
there
must
have
been
some
law
to
apply
in
the
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
talking
about
in
the
interim.
it's
from...
what
was
it...
'71
to
'73?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
rules
that
applied
were
state
rules
because
the
coast
guard
said,
states,
your
law
controls
while
we
haven't
got
any
yet.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
shows
that
there
must
have
been
state
law.
you...
you...
i
thought
you
were
saying
it's
been
forever
or
for
a
very
long
time
that
only
federal
law
sets
the
standards.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
coast
guard
must
have
thought
there
were
standards
in
existence
that
could
be
applied.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
do
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
did
congress
then
say
minimum
standards?
it
didn't
say
the
coast
guard
standards
are
necessarily
adequate.
it
just
said,
coast
guard,
set
minimum
standards.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
didn't
argue
that.
i
mean,
in
illinois...
all
through
the
illinois
state
courts,
the
assumption
was
that
the...
the
law
to
be
applied,
if
you
could
have
a
common
law,
would
be
illinois
common
law,
not
some
federal
maritime
common
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they...
all
they
said
is
that
the...
the
preemptive
force
is
different.
they
did
not
say
that
illinois
common
law
was
displaced.
that
is,
if
there
is
state
law
to...
if
there
is
law
other
than
the
coast
guard
regulations
to
apply,
it
was
illinois
state
law
all...
all
along.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
it
wasn't
until
this
court
that
you
raised
the
question,
never
mind
state
law,
the
federal
maritime
law
would
control
in
any
event.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
was
the
argument
that
illinois
law
is
preempted,
why
was
that
at
issue
at
all
if,
as
you
say,
there
is
no
state
law
in
this
area?
it's
all
federal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you...
in
your...
in
the
briefing
of
this
case
in
the
state
court,
did
you
make
the
argument
federal
law
covers
the
waterfront?
there
is
no
state
law
to
apply?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
yamaha
said
that
this
is
an
open
question,
and
it
didn't
resolve
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
that,
mr.
shapiro.
i
don't
know
why
the
illinois
state
legislature
couldn't
say
that
our
state
law
is
the
coast
guard's
standards
and
nothing
else.
a
state
legislature
could
see
that
this
kind
of
result
of
a
jury
never
happens
again.
the
state
would
be
free
to
say
precisely
that
whatever
the
coast
guard
includes
is
the
law,
and
what
they
haven't
included,
it
can't
be
required.
the
state
legislature
could
enact
such
a
law.
i
don't
see
why
it
couldn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
couldn't
a
state
legislature
say,
satisfaction
of
the
minimum
standards
prescribed
by
the
coast
guard
excludes
any
other
liability
for
design
defects?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
couldn't
the
state
legislature
say
that?
