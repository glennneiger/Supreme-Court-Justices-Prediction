justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not...
not
when...
i
mean,
that's
why
i
think
yours
is
the
better
view,
actually.
but
i
mean,
on
your
view
you
needn't
drive
a
wedge
between
the
common
law
and
positive
law
because
there's
meaning
for
both.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i've
never...
i
guess
it's
a
better
question
for
the
government.
i
don't
see
why
you'd
want
to
drive
a
wedge
between
those
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
you
need
that?
i
mean,
i'm...
i'm
interested.
i
might...
why
do
you
need
that
if,
in
fact,
your
interpretation
of
the
preemption
clause
is
correct?
there
are
some
regs
of
the
coast
guard
that
do
preempt
positive
common...
common
law
and
positive
law,
and
some
that
don't.
and
so
the
savings
clause
simply
makes
clear
that
those
that
don't,
don't.
it
gives
meaning
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
don't
need
this
damages
thing,
do
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
maybe.
that
may...
but
what
i
don't
see
here
is
whether
he's
aware
of
the
fact
which
is...
and
i'm
aware
of
it
and
you
are...
that
whatever
standard
the
coast
guard
has...
let's
say
you
have
to
have
a
1-inch
wire,
and
what
my...
they
mean
by
that
is
you
don't
have
to
a
2-inch
wire.
okay?
absolutely
clear.
and
there
is
no
point
in
telling
the
state
of
idaho
you
can't
pass
a
law
for
a
2-inch
wire
when
any
jury
in
the
state
of
idaho
can
come
in
with
a
judgment
that
does
precisely
the
same
thing
as
that
rule.
i
mean,
maybe
this
coast
guard
commandant
doesn't
care
about
whether
it
can
preempt
at
all,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
logical
to
take
the
position
you
can't
have
a
regulation
but
you
can
have
a
tort
judgment
that
is
identical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
say
we
don't
care
if,
in
fact,
the
rules
that
we're
about
to
promulgate
are
totally
ignored
by
the
states,
as
long
as
the
purpose
is
to
compensate
someone.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i
don't
see
how
you...
you
talk
about
straining.
all...
there
is
some...
number
of
statutes.
they
all
read
a
little
differently,
but
there
isn't
really
that
much
substantive
difference
between
them.
and
although
the
court
has
disagreed,
i've
tended
to
take
the
view,
treat
statutes
and
common
law
alike,
and
probably
they're
not
preempted
either
unless
the
agency
comes
in
and
makes
it
pretty
clear
that
they
are.
now,
that's
pretty
easy
for
people
to
follow.
if
they
want
to
argue
pro
and
con
preemption,
they
go
to
the
agency.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
wouldn't
i
reach
that
same
position
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
very
simple.
in
those
situations
where
you...
as
you
just
heard,
the
ones
that
the
petitioner
just
argued
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
how
it
is
so
different
from
geier.
i
mean,
you
read
it
as
saying
if
there's
no
regulation
at
all,
no
requirements,
then
the
state
couldn't
have
any
tort
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
you
would
say,
for
example...
not
just
that,
but
in
your
view
if
you
had,
like
a
propeller
that
shot
torpedoes,
i
mean,
something
that
was
absolutely
absurd,
you...
the
state
would
not
be
able
to
have
a
tort
judgment
based
on
that
even
though
the
coast
guard
has
never
had
the
chance
to
look
into
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
mean,
i
grant
you
that's
a
possible
reading.
but
i
think
perhaps
a
better
reading
of
it
would
be
that
you
can't
have
a...
a
rule
or
a
regulation
or
a
tort
judgment
or
any
other
requirement
of
law
different
from
a
coast
guard
requirement
when
there
is
a
requirement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
not
when
there
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
all
you'd
have
to
do
is
go
to
the
coast
guard
and
say,
look
what's
happened,
and
then
they'd
be
explicit,
if
you're
right.
and
the
other
side
there
would
have
a
chance
to
argue
to
the
coast
guard
that
you're
not
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
fine.
if
that's
the
policy
of
the
coast
guard,
then
i
don't
see
why
you
should
rely
upon
them
for
preemption.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you...
you
say
that...
that
in
the
situation
you...
where
you
have
the
conflicting
jury
verdicts,
which
i
agree
is
a
problem,
you
go
to
the
coast
guard
and
tell
them
that,
and
they
just
say,
oh,
that's
too
bad.
we
don't
care.
they
might
not
say
that,
of
course.
but...
but
if
they
did
say
that,
that's
why
congress
insisted
that
you
have
this
identical
requirement.
that's
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
they
do
just
refuse
to
have
any
requirement.
i
mean,
that's
equally
absurd
to
me.
on
the
one
hand,
you
point
to
one
absurdity
one
way,
but
it
seems
equally
absurd
to
have
no
law
in
the
area
where
the
coast
guard
just
refuses
to
act.
