what
would
happen
if
there
were
no
savings
clause
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
that...
that
this
clause
is
different,
say,
than
the
one
we
had
in
geier.
the
geier
clause...
savings
clause
begins...
or
preemption
clause
begins
with
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
regulation.
this
begins
the
other
way.
it
says
the
state
may
not
have
any
regulation
unless
it's
consistent
with
an
existing
federal
regulation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
a
state
said
there
can
be
a
common
law
action
in
the
courts
of
this
state
for
the
violation
of
any
safety
regulation
which
this
legislature
proposes,
and
we
hereby
direct
that
there
be
a
propeller...
a
guard
on
every
propeller.
would
that
statute
be
valid
under...
under
4306?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
4306
doesn't
require
a
coast
guard
standard.
it...
it
says
that
there's
a
disability
on
the
state
legislature
unless
there
is
a
coast
guard
standard
and
that
state
statute
is
parallel
to
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's...
let's
take
the
government's
position
which
is
that
the
state
could
not
pass
a
statute
on
a...
requiring
a
propeller...
a
propeller
guard.
if...
if
that's
true,
if
we
accepted
that,
why
is
it
that
a
jury
should
be
able
to
require
the
same
thing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let...
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
let's
assume
a...
a
hypothetical
case
in
which
the
engine
manufacturer
is
sued
and
is...
and
is
found
liable
by
the
jury
for
having
a
propeller
guard
which
makes
the
boat
difficult
to
turn
so
the
boat
hits
the
dock.
it...
it
can't
turn
fast
enough
to
avoid
the
dock.
we
have
that
case
and
it's
consolidated
with
yours.
so
we
have
one
case
where
they're
liable
for
having
the
guard
and
another
case
where
they're
liable
for
not
having
the...
the
guard.
would
you
argue
the
case
the
same
way
and
would
we
have
to
affirm
both
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
if
the
manufacturer
is
subject
to
conflicting
jury
verdicts,
as
you
indicate...
i
suppose
we
could
change
the
hypothetical
so
we
have
two
states,
one
which
requires
it,
the
other
of
which...
and...
and
you
would
say
those
weren't
preempted,
either.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
seems
to
me
to...
to
give
very
little
effect
to
the
wording
of
the
clause
which
says
that
a
state
cannot
have
a
standard
unless
it's
parallel
to
a
federal
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
commandant's
lawyer
or
the
commandant
might
well
admit
that
if,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
there's
defective
design,
if...
if
the
propeller
falls
apart
and...
that
then
there's
liability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that...
this...
this
thing
that
you
quote
us
just
brings
us
right
back
to
where
we
began.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
under
your...
your
rationale,
you
say,
oh,
but
there's
a
duty
to
compensate,
and
that's
different.
why
doesn't
that
same
argument
apply
so
that
you
tell
justice
o'connor,
oh,
yes,
the
jury
can...
can
go
full
speed
ahead?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
design
defect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's...
that's
not...
that's
not
true.
the
coast
guard
doesn't
say
how
the...
the
propeller
should
be
manufactured,
out
of
a...
an
eighth
of
an
inch
or...
or
of
a
tenth
of
an
inch
blade.
and
if
the
smaller
blade
falls
apart,
you
can
sue
the
manufacturer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
suppose
there
would
be
some
close
cases.
suppose
there's
two
ways
to
make
a
propeller.
one
is
to
have
it
slightly
canted
with
a
teflon
cover
and...
and
a
gear
mechanism
that
makes
it
stop
the
minute
it
hits
a
hard
object.
the
other
is
the
cheaper
way,
to
make
it
terribly
sharp
and
no...
no
ability
to
stop.
could
the
injured
party
sue
the
manufacturer
of
the
second
kind,
the...
the
cheap,
dangerous
kind
of
propeller?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
in
new
hampshire?
