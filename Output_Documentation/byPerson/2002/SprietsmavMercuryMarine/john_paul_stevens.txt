justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
satisfy
the
second
condition
of...
of
your
two-prong
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
i'm
just
asking
you
about
the
second
part
of
your
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
isn't
it
true
that
there
all...
aren't
there...
isn't
it
true
there
are
all
sorts
of
cases
in
which
different
designs
of
boats
may
have
a...
be
more
dangerous
than
other
designs,
depending
on
whether
they
have
a
propeller
guard?
i
notice
that
one
of
the
allegations
in
the
prayer
for
relief
in
the
complaint
was
they
provided
an
unreasonably
dangerous
design
in
utilizing
an
unprotected
propeller.
that...
as
i
read
that,
that
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
every
boat
needed
a...
a
propeller
guard,
but
rather
some
particularly
dangerous
designs
might
need
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
you
get
some
preemption
and
some
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
i'm
not
sure
you
answered
my
question
before.
again,
supposing
90
percent
of
the
boats
really
don't
need
a
propeller
guard,
using
the
reasoning
of
the
committee
that
decided
not
to
recommend.
but
there
are
10
percent
that
are
some
exotic
design
that's
particularly
dangerous
and
they
really
are
dangerous
unless
they
have
a...
a
propeller
guard
on
them.
could
you
say
that...
that
10
percent
has
to
be
treated
like
the
90
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
the
design.
i'm
just
talking
about
a
particular
design--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
seems
to
be
particularly
hazardous
if
you
had
the
propeller
too
close
to
the
person
operating
the
boat
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
what
if
the
manufacturer
of
the
propeller
is
on
notice
that
it's
being...
was
being
purchased
for
a
particularly
dangerous
design,
as
i've
described?
it
seems
to
me
sometimes
the...
the
company
could
know
what
kind
of
boats
it's
going
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
could...
it
seems
to
me
as
a
matter
of
defense
to
tort
liability,
you
could
put
all
that
evidence
in,
and
say
in
this
particular
case,
our
design
was
sensible
for
the
very
reasons
you
just
described.
therefore,
we're
not
negligent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
do
you
cite
kelly
against
washington
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
critically
important,
but
you
didn't
even
cite
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
shapiro,
the
solicitor
general
disagrees
with
you
on
this
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i...
i
thought
his
brief
said
he
thought
they're
wrong
on
the
presumption
going
the
other
way.
i'm
pretty
sure
that's
in
his
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
suggesting
that
if
this
action
had
been
in
lake
geneva,
wisconsin,
instead
of
where
it
was,
you'd
have
a
different
result
or
you
might
have
a
different
result?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
argument
you're
making
now
would
not
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
the
opinion
to
announce
in
no.
01-706,
sprietsma
against
the
brunswick
corporation,
a
case
that
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
petitioner's
wife
suffered
fatal
injuries
when
she
fell
off
a
motorboat
and
was
struck
by
its
propeller.
petitioner
brought
a
state
law
tort
suit
against
respondent,
the
manufacturer
of
the
motorboat
alleging
that
it
had
manufactured
an
unreasonably
dangerous
product,
because,
among
other
things,
the
motor
was
not
protected
by
a
propeller
guard.
the
state
court's
held
that
the
action
was
preempted
by
the
federal
boat
safety
act,
a
statute
enacted
by
congress
in
1971
to
improve
the
safe
operation
of
recreational
boats.
the
statute
gives
the
secretary
of
transportation
authority
which
has
been
delegated
to
the
coast
guard
to
issue
regulations
establishing
minimum
safety
standards
for
recreational
vessels
and
associated
equipment.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
petitioner's
action
is
preempted
either
by
the
federal
statute
itself
or
by
a
decision
of
the
coast
guard
in
1990
not
to
promulgate
a
regulation
requiring
propeller
guards
on
motorboats.
for
reasons
stated
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
petitioner's
action
is
not
preempted
and
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
