well,
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
coast
guard
could
require,
isn't
it?
propeller
guard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
arkansas
electric,
i
think
we
held
that
a
federal
decision
to
forego
regulation
in
a
given
area
may
imply
an
authoritative
federal
determination
that
the
area
is
best
left
unregulated
and
would
have
as
much
preemptive
force
as
a
decision
to
regulate.
is
that
the
situation
here?
certainly
the
coast
guard
looked
at
it
and
decided
not
to
regulate.
should
we
apply
arkansas
electric
and
say
that's
binding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
the
holding
of
arkansas
electric;
it
doesn't
have
to
take
the
form.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
the...
the
passage
i
read
to
you
indicates
that
a
decision
not
to
regulate
can,
in
fact,
be...
have
preemptive
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well...
well,
maybe
it
ought
to
be
interpreted,
to
try
to
make
sense
of
this
scheme,
as
certainly
covering
the
situation
where
the
state
by
its
common
law
doctrine
tries
to
make
a
requirement
that
the
coast
guard
has...
and
the
federal
government
has
flatly
contradicted
by
regulation.
that
may
not
be
this
case,
but
if
the
coast
guard
were
to
pass
a
regulation
saying
no
propeller
guards
should
be
put
on
boats
because
we
think
it
is
more
dangerous,
if
they
have
them,
now
we
should
interpret
the
savings
clause
as
not
allowing
a
cause
of
action
on
that
same
ground.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe...
maybe
it
doesn't
do
that
much.
i
mean,
maybe
the
savings
clause
allows
causes
of
action
for
breach
of
warranty,
for
negligent
operation
of
the
boat,
and
things
like
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
unless
there's
just
no
federal
regulation
at
all
on
this.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
the
federal
government
has
not...
acting
through
the
coast
guard,
has
made
no
requirement,
no
decision
at
all.
