mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
coast
guard
is
the
federal
agency
charged
with
administration
of
the
boat
safety
act
and
with
the
promulgation
of
safety
standards.
and
to
understand
the
coast
guard's
traditional
view
of
these
issues
and
the
backdrop
against
which
congress
legislated,
it
may
be
helpful
to
look
to
what
the
coast
guard
said
at
the
time
the
boat
safety
act
was
proposed.
and
if
you'll
look
to
page
31
of
the
blue
brief,
this
is
the
answer
provided
by
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
when
he
was
asked,
in
written
form,
whether
it
was
his
view
that
compliance
with
federal
safety
standards
would
furnish
a
complete
defense
to
liability
under
common
law
or
state
law.
and
he
was
further
asked,
if
there
wouldn't
be
a
complete
defense,
should
that
be
made
explicit
in
the
act.
and
the
commandant
said:
we
do
not
believe
that
compliance
with
promulgated
standards
under
the
act
has
the
effect
of
relieving
a
manufacturer
from
liability
under
the
usual
tort
law
concerning
negligence
or
warranties.
for
many--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--for
many
years
the
coast
guard
has
required
compliance
with
standards
by
inspected
vessels.
courts
have
consistently
held
that
a
vessel
owner's
compliance
with
coast
guard
inspection
requirements
is
not
synonymous
with
seaworthiness
under
maritime
law.
though
the
analogy
is
apparent,
we
would
have
no
objection
to
an
express
provision
to
clarify
that
a
manufacturer's
compliance
with
promulgated
standards
does
not
by
itself
relieve
him
of
any
tort
liability
which
otherwise
could
pertain.
and
i
think
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i'm
not
sure
whether
the
commandant
was
a
lawyer,
but
the...
the
questions
were
submitted
to
him
in
written
form.
he
was
given
time
to
consult
with
his
advisors
and
prepare
his
answers.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think...
i
think
what--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
a
couple
of
things
are
noteworthy
about
the
way
that
the
commandant
responded.
first,
when
he
gave...
first,
he
made
clear
that
the
coast
guard
was
familiar
and
was
comfortable
with
the
idea
that
even
when
it
had
inspected
a
vessel
and
had...
the...
the
vessel
had
passed
the
coast
guard's
own
regulatory
standards,
nevertheless
there
was
a...
the
possibility
of
damages
liability
based
on
unseaworthiness.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
think
part
of
the
argument
on
the
other
side
has
been
that
whatever
the
text
of
the
statute
might
say,
the
court
should
strain
to
hold
common
law
claims--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
first
of
all,
the
tort
judgment
is
not
identical
because
it
fulfills
an
important
purpose
that
the
prescriptive
standard
doesn't,
namely
compensating
people
who
have
actually
been
injured
by
reason
of
defects.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
as
this
court
made
clear
in
geier,
the
effect
of
holding
that
state
common
law
suits
are
not
categorically
preempted
is
not
that
the
federal
judgments
can
be
ignored;
that
is,
there's
still
a
role
for
principles
of
conflict
preemption.
the
court
in
geier
said
the
point
of
the
savings
clause
would
be
eviscerated
if
common
law
claims
were...
that
were
not
identical
to
federal
standards
were
categorically
preempted.
nevertheless,
particular
common
law
claims
can
conflict
with
the...
the
text
or
purposes
of
particular
regulations.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
what
he
is
saying
is
we
have
always
understood
that
compliance
with
our
regulatory
requirements
will
not
furnish
a
categorical
defense
to
suits
at
common
law
and
we
would
understand
the
same--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
exactly
right
and
that's
precisely
the
analysis
that
the
court
went
through
in
geier
and
it's
the
analysis
we
urge
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think
the
court
has
often
pointed
out
in
various
contexts
that
even
where
it
can
be
said
that
a
primary
goal
of
congress
was
x,
we
shouldn't
assume
that
congress
intended
to
pursue
that
goal
at
all
costs.
the
point
is
simply
that
congress
drew
a
somewhat
different
balance
with
respect
to
common
law
actions
than
it
did
with...
with
respect
to
prescriptive
rules.
and
i
think
part
of
the
reason
for
that
was
that
congress
was
establishing
a
mechanism
by
which
the
coast
guard
could
itself
promulgate
prescriptive
safety
standards.
in
ousting
state
law,
it
was
replacing
state
law
with
something
else.
but
the
boat
safety
act
doesn't
contain
any
mechanism
by
which
an
injured
person
can
seek
compensation
for
his
injuries,
and
therefore
it
was
natural
for
congress
to
determine
that
subject
to
conflict
preemption
principles,
the
remedial
mechanisms
that
had
previously
been
available
should
continue
to
be
available.
and
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
well,
the...
the
same
could
have
been
said
of
the
savings
clause
in
geier,
but
the
court,
nevertheless,
concluded
that
common
law
actions
were
not
categorically
preempted.
and
i
think
the
reason,
as
ms.
brueckner
said,
was
that
no
one
could
have
supposed
that
common
law
claims
going
to
an
entirely
different
aspect
of
the
manufacturer's
conduct
than
the
divine,
design
feature
that
was
at
issue
in...
in
the
coast
guard's
regulatory--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that
may--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that...
that
might
be
a
legitimate
rule
to
follow
in
the
absence
of
statutory
language
expressly
addressing
the
subject,
but
here
we
have
one
provision
that
says
a
state
may
not
establish
a
law
requirement
of
setting
forth
a
safety
standard
or
requirement
for
associated
equipment
unless
it
is
identical
to
a
federal
safety
standard.
and
then
in
the
savings
clause
it
says...
and
this
is
at
page
app.
6
of
the
blue
brief...
compliance
with
this
chapter
or
standards,
regulations,
or
orders
prescribed
under
this
chapter
does
not
relieve
a
person
from
liability
at
common
law
under
state
law.
so
whatever
that
means,
it
has
to
mean
there
will
be
some
circumstances
under
which
the
manufacturer
complies
with
all
applicable
federal
rules
and
yet
is
nevertheless
held
liable
under
the
common
law.
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but...
but
if...
if
the
same
rule
of
preemption
were
applied
to
common
law
suits
as
to
prescriptive
regulations,
namely
that
the
state
couldn't
do
anything
that
was
not
identical
to
federal
law,
it
could
never
be
the
case
that
a
manufacturer
who
complied
with
federal
law
could,
nevertheless,
be
held
liable
at
common
law.
the...
the
preemption
clause
and
the
savings
clause,
read
together,
compel
the
conclusion
that
congress
at
least
intended
a
different
rule
of
preemption
to
apply.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
i...
i
don't
think
anyone
would
have
contended
that
such
a
suit
would
be
preempted
by
the
preemption
clause
even
in
the
absence
of
the
savings
clause.
and
again,
this
is
exactly
the
same
situation
that
was
before
the
court
in
geier.
had...
had
that
argument
been
a
sound
one,
the
court
would
presumably
have
construed
the...
the
motor
vehicle
safety
act
savings
clause
that
was
at
issue
there--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
it
does
refer--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
it
does
refer
to...
may
i
finish?
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
refers
to
liability
under...
at
common
law
or
under
state
law,
and
therefore
state
law
is
most
naturally
taken
to
be
a
reference
to
laws
that
accomplish
purposes
similar
to
those
of
the
common
law.
