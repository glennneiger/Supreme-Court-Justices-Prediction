ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
state
common
law
tort
claims
that
a
boat
engine
was
defective
because
it
lacked
a
propeller
guard
are
preempted
either
by
the
boat
safety
act
of
1971
or
by
an
unpublished
coast
guard
letter
stating
that
the
agency
had
decided
not
to
take
any
regulatory
action
with
respect
to
propeller
guards.
there
is
no
express
preemption
here
because
the
boat
safety
act
includes
a
savings
clause
that
expressly
preserves
the
availability
of
common
law
claims.
and
in
light
of
this
clause,
this
case
boils
down
to
the
question
of
whether
our
claims
are
impliedly
preempted
because
they
conflict
with
some
valid
expression
of
federal
law.
and
the
answer
to
this
question
is
no
for
two
distinct
reasons.
first,
as
the
united
states
has
argued,
the
coast
guard
letter
itself
lacks
the
force
of
law
regardless
of
its
content.
and
second,
even
if
the
coast
guard
could
preempt
state
law
in
this
fashion,
there's
no
preemption
here
because
our
claims
are
entirely
consistent
with
the
coast
guard's
stated
reasons
for
not
taking
any
regulatory
action
with
respect
to
propeller
guards.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
if
there
were
no
savings
clause,
our
position
is
that
there
would
still
be
no
express
preemption
because
section
4306
of
the
boat
safety
act,
by
its
terms,
in
our
view
does
not
encompass
common
law
claims.
but
the
savings
clause--
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but
here,
as
in
geier,
reading
this
preemption
clause
as
encompassing
common
law
claims
would
render
the
savings
clause
of
this
statute
superfluous,
and
that
is
exactly
the
result
that
this
court
rejected
in
geier.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
in
our
view
that
statute
would
be
valid
because
we
read
4306
as
not
even
preempting
state
positive
law,
that
is,
laws
and
regulations,
unless
there's
an
actual
coast
guard
standard.
but
this
court
need
not
resolve
that--
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
--section
4306
in
our
view
can
be
read...
read
two
different
ways.
one,
our
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
it
only
kicks
in
where
the
coast
guard
has
regulated.
the
united
states
disagrees
on
this
point
and
reads
4306
as
expressly
preempting
all
forms
of
state
positive
law,
that
is,
laws
and
regulations,
even
where
the
coast
guard
hasn't
regulated.
but
the
united
states
and
we
agree
that
however
you
read
4306
with
respect
to
state
positive
law,
common
law
claims
are
preserved,
and
the
reason
is
that
4311(g)
would
be
stripped
of
any
meaning
if
4306
is
read
as
encompassing
common
law
claims.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
because
that
is
what
congress
made
clear
in
section
4311(g)
that
juries
should
be
able
to
do.
jury--
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
--i
agree,
justice
scalia.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
first,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
this
savings
clause
is
slightly
broader
than
that
at
issue
in
geier,
because
of
the
reference
to
state
law,
is
not
a
reason
to
construe
it
narrowly.
second,
the
reference
to
state
law
can
easily
be
understood
as
a
reference
to,
as
the
statute
itself
says,
liability
imposed
under
state
law,
which
we
read
to
mean
a
reference
to
state
damages
statutes
such
as
wrongful
death
and
survival.
and
this
case
is
a
perfect
illustration
of
that.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
section
4311(g)'s
language
is...
is
quite
clear
and
it
is
set
forth
at
the
blue
brief
at
page
6.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
i
disagree,
your
honor,
because
the
reference
to
liability
at
common
law
or
under
state
law
to
my
mind
suggests
a
reference
to
liability
under
state
law,
and
liability
under
state
law
in
this
context
is
liability
by
which
the
measure
of
damages
is
a
state
statute,
such
as
the
wrongful
death
statute
or
the
survival
statute
here
that
this
complaint
arises
under.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
that...
that
may
be,
your
honor.
i
would
note,
however,
that
in...
in
cipollone
this
court
noted
that
language
exactly
like
this,
a
savings
clause
that
specifically
preserved
liability
at
common
law
or...
or
under
state
law
in
the
comprehensive
smokeless
tobacco
act,
preserved
common
law
claims.
this
is
the
same
language.
and
again--
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
--you're
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
even
without
the
savings
clause,
we
read
section
4306
on
its
face
as
not
encompassing
common
law
claims,
and
the
main
reason
why,
putting
aside
the
savings
clause,
is
that
the
language
of
4306
tracks
the
language
of
section
4302
of
the
statute,
which
is
the
affirmative
delegation
of
rulemaking
authority
of
the
coast
guard.
it's
on
the
first
page
of
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief.
and
4302
authorizes
the
coast
guard
to
do
two
things:
promulgate
minimum
safety
standards
and
require
associated
equipment.
and
this
is
exactly
the
same
language
that's
in
4306.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
absolutely,
your
honor,
under--
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
--no,
your
honor,
and
here
is
why.
this
case
really
presents
the
question,
putting
aside
the
express
preemption
issue
which
we
believe
is
resolved
by
geier,
of
under
what
circumstances
does
an
agency's
affirmative
decision
not
to
regulate
pack
a
preemptive
punch
such
as...
so
as
to
wipe
out
common
law
claims.
and
there
are...
there
are
two
preconditions
that
must
be
met,
neither
of
which
is
present
here.
first,
the
agency's
decision
not
to
regulate
must
take
the
form
that
itself
possesses
the
force
of
law,
and
that
is
lacking
here
for
reasons
i'll
explain
in
a
moment.
second,
the
agency--
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
--actually
the
holding
of
arkansas
electric
was
that
there
was
no
preemption
at
all
in
that
case,
but
perhaps
your
honor
is--
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
--yes,
your
honor,
but
a
pure
decision
not
to
regulate
or
a
pure
agency
inaction
has
only
been
held
to
exert
preemptive
effect
in
the
context
of
statutes
that
preempt
the
field
where
there's
total
federal
occupation
of
the
field.
here,
however
you
read
4306
with
respect
to
state
laws
and
regulations,
common
law
claims
we
believe
are
excluded
from
the
regulated
field.
therefore,
there
has
to
be
a
conflict.
and
for
affirmative...
an
affirmative
agency
decision
not
to
regulate
to
preempt
state
law
under
a
conflict
preemption
analysis,
there
both
has
to
be
an
agency
action
that
possesses
the
force
of
law
and
there
has
to
be
an
actual
conflict
between
the
agency's
underlying
reasons
for
not
regulating
and
the
common
law
claims.
and
both
of
these
criteria
are
absent
here.
first,
as
the
united
states
has
argued...
and
we
agree...
this
unpublished
letter...
coast
guard
letter
itself
lacks
the
force
of
law.
it's
important
to
remember
here
that
not
only
is
there
no
agency
regulation,
but
there
was
never
any
rulemaking.
there
was
never
any
publication
of
a
notice
that
the
coast
guard
was
even
considering--
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
--yes,
your
honor,
and...
and
your
honor's
hypothetical
actually
illustrates
my
point.
there's
no
question
that
a
boat
manufacturer
could
not
be
held
liable
for
installing...
could
not
be
held...
a...
a
claim
alleging
that
a
boat
manufacturer
was
negligent
per
se
for
installing
a
propeller
guard
couldn't
be
based
on
an
existing
coast
guard
regulation
because
the
letter
lacks
the
force
of
law
with
respect
to
boat
manufacturers.
there's
no
agency
action
here
that
could
form
the
basis
for
any
common
law
claim
one
way
or
the
other.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and...
and
this
is--
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
--but
it
does
give
meaning
to
the
language
of
section
4311(g)
which
says
that
even
where
a
coast
guard
has
promulgated
a
minimum
safety
standard,
common
law
liability
is
preserved
except
to
the
extent
that
there's
an
actual
conflict.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
i
respectfully
disagree,
justice
ginsburg,
and...
and
here's
why.
the
respondent
here
does
contend
that
the
savings
clause
applies
to
breach
of
warranty
and
negligent
manufacturing
claims.
and
that
argument
fails,
first
of
all,
because
such
claims
are
not
encompassed
within
4306
on
its
face,
and
therefore
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
need
for
congress
to
save
those
claims.
secondly,
this
court
construed
a
similar
savings
clause
in
geier
as
expressing
congress's
intent
that
mere
compliance
with
minimum
safety
standards
would
not
be
an
absolute
defense
to
liability
in
a
product
liability
action.
and
compliance
with
a
coast
guard
regulation
establishing
a
minimum
safety
standard
could
never
be
an
absolute
defense
in
a
case
involving
negligent
manufacture
or
a
breach
of
warranty,
for
example.
so,
the
respondent's
theory
leaves
really
no
meaningful
role
for
the
savings
clause
to
play.
and
i
would
emphasize
that
these
arguments
were
all
asked
and
answered
in
geier,
and
the
court
held
that
a
similarly
worded
savings
clause,
albeit
without
the
reference
to
state
law,
has
to
mean
that
common
law
claims
are
not
expressly
preempted.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
our
claims
must
necessarily
be
permitted
to
go
forward
if
they
conflict
with
federal
law,
but
there's
clearly
no
conflict
here
again
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
coast
guard
letter
lacks
the
force
of
law.
and
on
that
point,
before
turning
to
the
reasons
why
our
claims
are
actually
consistent
with
the
coast
guard's
stated
reasons
for
declining
to
regulate,
i
would
further
note
that
not
only
is
there
no
regulation,
no
rulemaking
here,
but
the
coast
guard
letter
was
never
even
published
in
the
federal
register.
it
was
never
made
available
to
the
public
in
any
formal
way
whatsoever.
and
it
doesn't
even
purport
to
set
forth
a
definitive
agency
position
on
the
subject
of
propeller
guards.
what
the
letter
says
is
that
the
agency
is
going
to
continue
to
consider
the
matter
and
gather
further
data.
and
so,
this
letter
itself
lacks
the
force
of
law.
the
second
reason,
of
course,
is
that
even
if
the
coast
guard
could
preempt
simply
by
writing
a
letter,
our
claims
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
coast
guard's
stated
reasons
for
declining
to
regulate.
the
coast
guard
was
focusing
on
the
lack
of
a
universally
acceptable
propeller
guard
solution,
the
costs
of
a
retrofit,
and
such
other
matters,
and
there's
no
inconsistency
between
our
claims--
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
--there
would
still
be
no
preemption
here
because
the
coast
guard
letter
lacks
the
power
to
preempt.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
it
would,
your
honor,
but
our
position
is
that
there
still
has
to
be
a
regulation
and
there's
no
regulation
here.
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
it
would
satisfy
the
second
part
of
the
test.
finally,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may,
but
i--
ms.
leslie
a.
brueckner
your
honor,
the...
the
maritime
argument
was
waived.
the
reason
the
united
states
never
briefed
it
is
that
respondents
didn't
even
raise
it
in
their
opposition
brief
to
this
court.
it
was
never
raised
until
they
filed
their
brief
on
the
merits.
this
is
not
the
time
or
place
to
decide
the
issue
raised
by
respondent,
particularly
the
yamaha
question
that
was
specifically
left
reserved
in
justice
ginsburg's
opinion.
on
the
savings
clause,
their
whole
argument
is
that
the
savings
clause
must
be
read
simply
to
preserve
breach
of
warranty
and
negligent
installation
claims.
not
only
is
this
not
supported
by
the
language
of
the
clause,
which
is
itself
broad,
but
the
legislative
history
of
the
boat
safety
act
in
the
senate
report...
let's
forget
about
the
commandant
for
the
time
being.
the
senate
report
states...
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
blue
brief
at
32...
that
the
purpose
of
this
section
to
assure
that
in
a
product
liability
suit
mere
compliance
with
the
minimum
standards
promulgated
under
the
act
will
not
be
a
complete
defense
to
liability.
this
demonstrates
that
congress
had
in
mind
product
liability
actions
just
like
this
one.
respondent
also
claims
that
these
boats
are...
are
terribly...
that
propeller
guards
are
terribly
hazardous
and
the
coast
guard
has
found
this.
well,
first
of
all,
the
coast
guard
letter
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
hazards
of
propeller
guards.
and
contrary
to
mr.
shapiro's
contention,
in
april
2001,
the
coast
guard's
advisory
committee
issued...
stated
in
its
minutes
a
recommendation
that
the
coast
guard
actually
require
propeller
guards
as
one
of
four
permitted
options
on
boats
exactly
like
this
one.
this
is...
the
cite
is
on
page
11,
footnote
14
of
the
yellow
brief.
so
not
only
did
the
coast
guard
not
find
in
1990
that
propeller
guards
are
hazardous,
but
it's
considering
requiring
them
on
boats
just
like
this
one.
on
the
conflicting
judgments
point,
mr.
shapiro
raises
the
specter
of
conflicting
jury
verdicts
in
these
cases
and
congress
cannot
possibly
have
intended
that
result.
that's
exactly
the
result
that
congress
permitted
in
the
context
of
motor
vehicles
where,
absent
a
federal
safety
standard,
the
states
are...
juries
are
permitted
to
impose
whatever
liability
they
choose.
and
even
where
there's
a
minimum
standard,
under
geier,
jury
verdicts
may
be
permitted
to
go
forward.
but
if...
and
indeed
there
are
conflicting
jury
verdicts
that
arise,
the
coast
guard
can
step
into
the
breach,
and
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
state
legislatures
could
pass
a
rule
saying
that
no
liability
could
be
imposed
in
cases
like
this
one.
i
would
also
point
out
on
this
conflicting
jury
verdict
problem
that
we
are
not
seeking
punitive
damages
in
this
case.
punitive
damages
are
not
available
in
illinois
in
a
wrongful
death
action.
finally,
i
would
note
that
the
absence
of
a
regulation
is
itself
reason
to
find
no
preemption
here.
this
statute,
as
we
read
it,
provides
that
common
law
claims
may
be
permitted
to
go
forward
unless
there's
a
conflict.
here
there's
no
regulation.
there's
no
formal
statement
of
agency
purposes.
there's
no
articulated
reasons
that
our
claim
could
possibly
conflict
with.
and
finally,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
we
have
a
victim
here
who
would
be
left
without
any
compensation
whatsoever
if
this
court
holds
that
common
law
claims
are
preempted.
we
would
urge
this
court
to
permit
our
claims
to
proceed.
thank
you.
