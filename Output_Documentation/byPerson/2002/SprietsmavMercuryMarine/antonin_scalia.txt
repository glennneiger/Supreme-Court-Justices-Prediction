ms.
brueckner,
here's...
here's
my
problem
with
4311(g).
you
can...
it
not
only
is
a
savings
clause
for
common
law,
it's
also
a
savings
clause
for
state
law.
it
says
it
does
not
relieve
a
person
from
liability
at
common
law
or
under
state
law.
now,
i...
i
do
not
know
how
an
intelligent
congress
could
have...
could
have
written
such
a
thing.
but
that's
what
it
says:
at
common
law
or
under
state
law.
now,
you
can't
read
the
savings
clause
portion
that
says
under
state
law
to
mean
all
state
law
because
then
the
savings
clause
would
totally
cancel
the
preemption
clause.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you...
you
have
to
limit
state
law
to
mean,
well,
not
all
state
law.
and
why...
why
would
it
not
be
natural
to
read
common
law
also
not
to
include
all
common
law,
for
example,
not
including
any
common
law
that
specifically
imposes
liability
for
failure
to
have
certain
propeller
standards?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
but
the
savings
clause
says
even
those
that
do,
don't.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
isn't
that
the--
--no,
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to...
the...
the...
i'm
certain
it's
not
clear
to
the
contrary,
but
it's
at
least
arguably
to
the
contrary.
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
do
we
care
whether
the
coast
guard
was
happy?
i
mean,
this
isn't
even
plumbing
the
mind
of
congress.
it's
plumbing
the
mind
of
the
coast
guard.
what
do
we
care?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
commandant
didn't
seem
to
understand
that.
in...
in
your
endorsement
of
the
commandant's
statement,
i
thought
you
were
disagreeing
with...
with
counsel
for
the
petitioners
here
who...
who
did
say
that
there
could
be
conflict
preemption
of
common
law
claims,
anyway.
the
commandant
doesn't
even
seem
to
recognize
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
geier
didn't
have
the
same
clause,
and
i...
i
think
it's
a
big
difference
when
it
says
under
common
law
or
state
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
you...
you
have
to
distinguish
state...
not
just
state
common
law,
but
state
statutes.
you
have
to
draw
some
line
that
is
going
to
exclude
state
statutes
as
well
as
the
common
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
not
necessarily.
i
mean,
you
say
if
illinois
imposes
it,
i
mean,
this
is
one
reason,
it
seems
to
me,
that
you
can
take
the
statute
at...
at
its
word.
the
common
law
never
imposes
a
requirement.
this
jury
found
that
a
propeller...
that
failure
to
have
a
propeller
guard
was
negligence.
another
jury
in
another
case
in
the
same
state
may
find
that
the
failure
to
have
a
propeller
guard
was
not
negligence.
there's
no
state
requirement
being
imposed.
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
do
you
treat
the
savings
clause?
what...
what
do
you
think
it
means?
