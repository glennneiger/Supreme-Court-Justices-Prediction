justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
did
they...
did
they
go
through
any,
in
effect,
administrative
procedure
kind
of
formal
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
be...
it
may
not
be
necessary
in
the
sense
that
they
are
under
an
obligation
to
do
it,
but
if
they
don't
do
something
like
that,
i...
i
don't
know
that
their...
their
announcement
has
any
particular
status
that's
relevant
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
to
make
this
clear,
would
you
identify
the
kinds
of
cases
that
you
envision
at
state
law
that
this
clause,
in
effect,
says
you
may
not
defend
conclusively
by
claiming
compliance
with
a
coast
guard
reg?
what
kinds
of
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
no,
no,
i
understand
your
point.
but
you've
got
negligent
operation
and
what...
what
else
do
you
have
in
mind?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
how
about
negligent
manufacture?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean,
that
may
be
true
if
you're
talking
about
commercial
boating,
but
it's
not
true
of
recreational
boating.
justice
david
h.
souter
little
motorboats?
justice
david
h.
souter
5-foot
skiffs
and
little
put-puts?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
because
it...
it
happens
to
lie
on
the
border
between
two
states,
but
not
every
landlocked
lake
is
subject
to...
to
coast
guard
maritime
jurisdiction.
