mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
a
word
of
history
here
explains
some
of
the
mystery
surrounding
the
statutory
language.
for
over
90
years,
congress
has
specified
the
safety
equipment
that
has
to
be
installed
on
motorboats,
and
it
was
in
1937
that
this
court
ruled
in
kelly
v.
washington
that
the
states
may
not
impose
their
own
requirements
for
safety
equipment
on
boats
that
travel
in
interstate
waters.
and
that
was
the
background
of
this
legislation.
this
act
preempts
state
law
creating
any
requirement
for
boat
equipment
that
is
not
identical
with
the
prescribed
coast
guard
regulation.
and
this
serves
a
critical
fail-safe
purpose.
risky
devices
like
propeller
guards
may
not
be
imposed
on
the
public
under
state
law
unless
and
until
they're
approved
by
the
expert
regulatory
agency
under
the
criteria
that
congress
has
laid
down.
now,
this
preemption
provision
has
three
exceptions
which
are
written
right
into
the
provision,
but
none
of
those
exceptions
fits
this
case.
so
my
friends
have
to
make
the
argument
that
this
general
savings
clause,
which
says
nothing
about
preemption,
is
another
implicit
exception,
but
that's
inconsistent--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and...
and--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
the...
the
wisdom
of
this
statute
is
that
until
the
coast
guard
makes
a
decision
about
a
device
like
propeller
guards,
they
may
not
be
imposed
on
the
public.
think
of
what
happens
under
justice
kennedy's
example.
if
illinois
commands
installation
of
these
devices
and
backs
up
that
judgment
with
millions
of
dollars
in
damages,
people
in
49
other
states
are
exposed
to
the
risks
and
burdens
of
propeller
guards.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
we
agree
with
the
statement
in
garmon
that
the
court,
for
preemption
purposes,
should
assume
compliance
and
then
ask
what
are
the
implications.
the
implications
are
that
illinois
could
coerce
the
installation
of
these
devices.
another
state
may
disagree.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
or
one
or--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
after
the
first
jury
verdict,
then
the...
in
come
the
claims
for
punitive
damages
in
the
next
case,
and
there
is
a
powerful
coercive
effect
from
damage
actions.
this
court
has
said
so.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
what's--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the...
what
the
safety
council
found,
the
coast
guard's
committee
of
21
experts,
was
that
for
all
boats
that
travel
more
than
10
miles
an
hour,
these
are
infeasible
devices.
and
the
reason
is
you
have
to
match
the
propeller
guard
with
the
particular
engine
and
the
particular
hull
combination.
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
hulls
out
there.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the...
the
coast
guard
said
that
the
available
accident
data
compiled
by
the
21
experts
did
not
support
a
propeller
guard
requirement
under
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
in
april
of
2001,
they
looked
at
this
again,
and
the
coast
guard
representative
on
the
safety
council
said
we
realize
we
cannot
mandate
installation
of
propeller
guards.
they're
not
feasible,
and
the
propeller
guard
subcommittee
said
again,
these
will
increase
blunt
trauma
injuries.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
it's...
i
believe
it's
footnote
14
in
plaintiff's
reply
brief.
they...
they
cite
to
the
web
site
for
these
council
minutes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
but
under
this
statute,
that
isn't
necessary,
your
honor.
it...
they...
they
did
have--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
because
of
the
wording
of
this
statute,
which
is
so
different
from
geier...
it's
the
exact
opposite
of
geier...
under
this
statute,
unless
there's
an
identical
coast
guard
regulation
in
place,
state
law
is
preempted.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
as
to
equipment,
associated
equipment,
for
boats,
unless
there's
a
coast
guard
regulation
in
place,
the
states
can't
mandate
that
equipment.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--your
honor--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--your
honor,
we...
we
think
that
overlooks
the
history
that
i
began
with
because
under
this
court's
decisions,
the
states
could
not
impose
requirements
for
equipment
or...
or
construction,
design
or
structure
for
boats
moving
in
interstate
waters.
that
was
kelly
v.
washington,
a
unanimous
opinion
by
chief
justice
hughes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
yes,
there...
there
are
three
exceptions
to
the
preemption
provision.
they're
explicit
exceptions,
and
we
don't
have
to
go
looking
to
the
savings
clause
for
a
fourth,
implied
exception.
there...
there
is
an
exception
if
the
coast
guard
grants
an
exemption
under
apa
procedures.
they
didn't
do
that
here.
there's
another
exemption
for
local
hazardous
conditions,
but
that
exception
doesn't
fit
here
either.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
the
key
point,
your
honor.
that
was
done
by
formal
exemption,
and
that
shows
that
this
statute
has
the
exceptions
built
right
into
preemption
provision.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
what...
what
was
happening,
according
to
the
legislative
history,
is
the
states
were
beginning
to
require
battery
covers,
anchors,
lines,
and
other
pieces
of
associated
equipment,
including
warning
decals
on
the
boats,
and
congress
says,
this
has
to
stop.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
these
requirements,
but
we
can't
have
50
sets
of
them.
so
this
field
is
being
preempted
for
associated
equipment
requirements
until
the
coast
guard
adopts
a
regulation
or
the
coast
guard
gives
an
exemption,
which
it
did
in
1971.
and
i
think
the
structure
is
very
important.
this
is
so
different
from
geier.
there
was
not
a
structure
like
this
with
three
exceptions
written
right
into
the
statute,
and
to
treat
the
savings
clause,
which
doesn't
say
a
word
about
preemption
and
which
the
legislative
history
says
is
simply
a
matter
of
state
law
defenses,
as
a
fourth,
implied
exception
to
preemption
truly
does
violence
to
the
structure
of
this
law.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
does
not
address
preemption
at
all.
it
addresses
an
affirmative
defense
that
it...
that
could
be
available
under
state
law.
that's
the
defense
of
compliance
with
coast
guard
regulations
or
orders
or
any
provision
of
this
entire
statute.
now,
section
288c
of
the
restatement
of
torts...
this
is
an
echo
of
section
288c
which
was
published
just
a
few
years
before
congress
passed
the
savings
provision.
it
doesn't
deal
with
preemption
at
all.
it
deals
with...
with
compliance.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
has
a
huge
scope
of
operation,
unlike
geier.
to
start
with
the
coast
guard's
example,
the
ordinary
negligence
case,
negligent
operation
was
very
important
to
congress
because
most
of
these
propeller
accidents
occur
because
of
negligent
operation
or
reckless
operation
of
the
boat.
that's
what
the
coast
guard
says
on
its
web
site
today.
and
so
the
defendant
couldn't
defend
by
saying,
gee,
my
boat
complies
with
all
the
coast
guard
regulations--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the...
the
next
thing
the
coast
guard
referred
to
is
express
warranty.
the
defendant
couldn't
say
simply
because
i've
complied
with
this
long
list
of
coast
guard
requirements,
i
don't
have
to
honor
my
contractual
promises
or--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--negligent
installation
is
certainly
covered,
and
defective
manufacture
is
also
protected
by
the
savings
clause.
that's
when
a
particular
unit
comes
off
the
assembly
line
and
it's
defective.
those
were
the
original
tort
cases--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it
is
possible
and
for
this
reason.
the
language
of
the
statute
for
associated
equipment
only
preempts
requirements
for
associated
equipment.
and
that
could
be
construed
to
mean
simply
requirements
to
install
propeller
guards,
which
you've
not
installed.
now,
if
you
took
a
different
interpretation
of
requirements
for,
it
might
encompass
that
case,
but
this
court
could
give
a
narrow
construction
to
requirements
for.
and
this
case
is
the
paradigm
case
because
manufacturers
have
decided
not
to
use
this
kind
of
safety
equipment
because
they
know
it's
a
hazard.
it's
a
known
hazard.
several
courts
have
disapproved
these
devices.
21
safety
experts
of
the
coast
guard
have
pointed
out
the
dangers
that
this
creates.
so
manufacturers
have
consciously--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
because
the
manufacturer
doesn't
know--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
reason
that's
preempted
and
that
that
is
a
requirement
for
associated
equipment,
even
in
the
case
that
you
give,
is
because
the
manufacturer
has
no
idea
what
hull
is
going
to
be
put
together
with
this
motor.
the
motor
can
move
from
hull
to
hull
to
hull.
and
what
the
coast
guard
found...
the...
the
committee
found
in
its
report
was
that
you
have
to
have
an
exact
hydrodynamic
fit
between
the
particular
engine
and
the
particular
hull
and
the
particular
propeller
guard.
so
if
juries,
say,
impose
propeller
guards
on...
on
designs
we
think
are
dangerous--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
we...
we
rely
on
the
logic
of
this
committee
report
which
says
that...
that
for
all
planing
boats
that
go
10
miles
an
hour
or
faster,
these
devices
are
counterproductive
because
they
interfere
with
steering.
they
double
the
amount
of
fuel
that's
consumed.
they
increase
air
and
water
pollution
and
they
create
serious
hazards
of
blunt
trauma
injury.
so
what
the...
the
committee
found
was
that
these
devices
for
any
category
of
planing
boat...
and
here
we
have
a
boat
that
goes
50
miles
an
hour.
we've
got
an
18-foot
ski
boat
with
a
115
horsepower
engine.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
that's
true
in
many
of
these
preemption
cases,
but
all
it
takes
is
an
errant
jury
verdict
or
two
or
three
to
coerce
a
decision
by
the
manufacturer
to
install
devices
that
are
very
hazardous
to
the
public.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
justice
breyer,
that's
cold
comfort.
they
would
hand
us
this
brief
that
they've
just
submitted
saying
that
it's
up
to
the
jury
to
decide
whatever
the
jury
wants.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
because
congress
had
a
different
vision.
congress
was
going
with
the
rule
of
kelly,
kelly
against
washington.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
legislative
history
is
very
explicit
on
that.
the
boating
associations
and
the
manufacturers
associations
had
all
kinds
of
very
elaborate
standards
of
their
own,
and
everybody
said
during
these
hearings
that
is
to
be
encouraged.
we
want
them
to
do
more
of
that.
the
statute
shouldn't
stop
that.
but
there
was
no
suggestion
that
the
states
could
intervene
and
impose
their
own
standards
and
their
own
requirements.
and
in
fact,
in
the
ray
decision,
this
court
said
minimum
standards
under
another
similar
statute
do
not
mean...
do
not
mean
that
the
states
can
embroider
on
and
supplement
those...
those
standards.
and
after
all,
the
preemption
provision
here
doesn't
say
anything
about
minimum
standards
or
maximum
standards.
it
says
all
requirements
for
boat
safety
equipment
are
preempted
unless
there
is
an
identical
coast
guard
regulation
in
place.
this
is
the
rule
of
kelly
against
washington
which--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
did
not.
plaintiffs
cited
it
in
their
brief.
it's
302
u.s.
and
i'll
give
the
court
the
cite.
i
think
it's
critically
important.
302
u.s.
at
14
through
15.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
it's
quoted
in
the
cases
that
we
do
cite.
it's
quoted
in
the
ray
decision.
it's
a...
it's
an
early
precursor
of
ray
and
in
locke.
i
was
explaining
it
as...
as
the
background
of
congress's
legislation
here.
and
i'd
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
makes
a
huge
difference
here
that
this
is
a
case
that
arises
in
the
maritime
context.
at
a
minimum,
the
maritime
context
means
there
is
no
presumption
against
preemption,
as
the
court
below
held.
and
because
congress
wanted
to
achieve
uniformity--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--oh,
yes,
it
is.
we
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
because
this
court--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--absolutely.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
since
the
'40s
and
the
'50s,
this
court,
and
later
in
foremost
and
in
sisson,
this
court
has
held
that
recreational
boats
fall
squarely
within
the
maritime
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i...
there
may
be
some
carve-out
for
new
hampshire
in
this
statute.
[laughter]
and
i've
tried
to
figure
out
the
reasons
for
that
carve-out,
and
i've
never...
i've
never
understood
those.
but
this
is
maritime
context,
and
this
lake...
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
has
held
that
is...
it's
a
navigable
interstate
body
of
water.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
absolutely
not.
it
has
to
be
an
interstate
body
of
water.
but
since
the
1850s,
this
court
has
held
that
interstate
waterways
are
subject
to
the
maritime
jurisdiction.
and
this
waterway,
by
the
way,
was
constructed
by
the
u.s.
army
corps
of
engineers.
it's
surrounded
with
marinas
that
rent
pleasure
boats,
and
this
is
big
business,
the
pleasure
boating
business,
on
dale
hollow
lake.
and
because
this
is
a
maritime
context,
that
says
a
lot
about
the
savings
clause,
because
this
court
has
held
that
in
maritime
cases,
savings
clauses
should
be
interpreted
narrowly
to
avoid
obstructing
the
carefully
constructed
preemption
provision
in
the
statute
and
to
avoid
making
an
end
run
around
the
coast
guard's
expert
supervision,
which
is
what
congress
wanted.
and
we
go
further
and
say
that
because
the
court
below
was
right
in
characterizing
this
as
an
admiralty
case,
any
conflict
between
illinois
law
and
federal
law
is
just
imaginary.
that's
because
federal
common
law
follows
federal
maritime
jurisdiction,
and
there
can't
be--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
the
illinois
supreme
court
agreed
with
us
on
this
point.
they
have
two
pages
in
their
opinion--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
we
think
this
is
an
included
question.
it
was
certainly
addressed
by
the
court
below.
the
court
below
cited
this
court's
jensen
decision,
which
is
the
leading
maritime
preemption
decision.
and
it
was
using
maritime
analysis
to
support
the
preemption
holding
that
the
court
ultimately
made.
now,
this
was
step
number
one
in
our
preemption
argument
below,
but
we're
entitled
to
elaborate
it
in
this
court
and
cite
additional
cases.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
we...
we
proceeded
to
argue
in
the
alternative
that
under
express
preemption
and
under
a
conflict
preemption
that...
that
state
law
was
preempted.
but
with
a
two-page
discussion
in
this
opinion
on
maritime,
i
think
it
is
an
addressed
and
included
question.
and
if
the
court
doesn't
consider--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
made
the
first
part
of
the
argument.
we
said
federal
law
covers
the
waterfront
because
congress
conceived
of
this
as
a
maritime
question
and
was
preempting
state
law
broadly,
exerting
its
traditional,
under
kelly
against
washington,
the
usual
federal
government
role
over
equipment
installed
on
motorboats.
and
we
said
that
this
is
an
enclave
of
federal
law.
and
we
cited
this
court's
yamaha
decision
and
we
cited
the
foremost
decision.
we
cited
admiralty
cases
and
we
said
it
was
an
admiralty
case.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
right,
but
our...
my
point
is
that
we
were
citing
this
court's
admiralty
decisions.
and
then
the
illinois
supreme
court
went
further
and
cited
a
host
of
additional
admiralty
decisions.
now,
when
you
have
that
kind
of
discussion
in
a
state
court
opinion
of
a
federal
law
issue,
this
court,
i
believe,
can
reach
that
as
an
included
question
and
it's
an
intertwined
question.
and
let
me
suggest
it
is
the
easiest
way
to
resolve
and
the
narrowest
way
to
resolve
this
case
because
it
is
propeller
guard-specific.
it
makes
no
aggressive
law
regarding
tort
claims
on...
on
the
land,
and--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
solicitor
general
hasn't
briefed
this
point,
the
maritime
law
point.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
think
you'd
have
the
same
result,
but
you
would
have
fewer
reasons
for
reaching
that
same
result.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
would
not
apply.
it
would
apply
to...
to
lake
michigan
but
not
to
lake
geneva.
now,
i'd
like...
like
to
return
to
justice
kennedy's
comment
about
the
conflicting
judgments
among
state
courts.
if...
if
illinois
were
to
mandate
propeller
guards
and
back
up
the
judgment
with
millions
of
dollars
in
damages,
that
would
impose
these
devices
on
all
the
people
in
the
united
states,
and
at
everybody's
estimate,
these
are
risky
devices
with
serious
problems.
and
in
the
next
case
in
another
state,
we
would
be
sued
for
installing
these
devices.
the
walt
disney
world
was
sued.
they
put
a
little
propeller
guard
on
a
bumper
boat
and
they
were
sued
when
a
kid's
arm
got
caught
in
the
propeller
guard.
so
sure
as
can
be,
if...
if
one
state
mandates
them,
the
next
state
is
going
to
penalize
them.
and
the
legislatures
of
the
state...
this
is
the
worst
and
most
shocking
aspect
of
this
theory.
the
legislatures
of
the
states
could
not
protect
their
citizens
against--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--what
it...
what
it
could
not
enact
is
a
law
that
says
no
boats
coming
into
the
state
of
illinois
or
california
may
be
equipped
with
propeller
guards.
why?
because
that's
not
identical
with
the
coast
guard
regulation.
and
yet,
the
juries
in
various
states
could
be
imposing
these
devices.
people
could
be
losing
their
lives
and
boats--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
think
that
that
may
well
be
a
safety
standard
in
disguise,
but
it...
the
state
could
not
do
the
thing
that
it
really
had
to
do
which
was
to
prohibit
boats
using
propeller
guards.
if...
if
juries
in
various
parts
of
the
united
states
put
pressure
on
manufacturers
to
put
propeller
guards
on
their
boats,
the
legislature
needs
the
power
to
say
no,
this
can't
come
into
the...
can't
come
into
the
state.
but
that
is
clearly
preempted
under
the
sg's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and
i
think
that
is
a
true
disservice
to
federalism,
to
have
these
kinds
of
conflicting
judgments,
and
it
shows
the
wisdom
of
congress's
architecture
in
this
statute,
that
the
states
may
not
impose
requirements
for
propeller
guards
unless
and
until
the
coast
guard
vets
these
proposals,
finds
that
they're
safe,
finds
that
they
satisfy
federal
criteria
of
feasibility
and
safety,
and
adopts
the
rule
and
a
regulation.
it's
like
fda
legislation,
protect
the
public
against
common
law
claims
of
this
sort
that
could
have
such
serious
adverse
effects
on
the
public.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the...
there's
a
good
reason
for
refusing
to
act
in
this
instance,
and
that
is,
these
devices
are
very
hazardous.
you
can't
turn
the
boat
safely.
there's
a
danger
of
blunt
trauma
injury
that
is
worse
than
the
propeller
slices.
a
surgeon
can
slice
up
propeller
slices
occasionally,
but
the
blunt
trauma
injury
from
a
propeller
guard
is
lethal
if
it
hits
you
in
the
chest
or
in
the
head.
and
it...
it...
the
steering
is
interfered
with.
you
have
to
double
the
horsepower
of
these
engines
once
you
put
a
big
bird
cage
around
or
a
big
circle
around
the
propeller
guard.
there...
there
are
thousands
of
pounds
per
square
inch
of
pressure
exerted
on
these
propeller
guards,
and
they
create
a
serious
navigation
hazard.
and
it...
it
isn't
just
the
committee
that
in
1990
concluded
that
these
were
dangerous.
these
were
30
experts
on
safety
appointed
by
the
secretary
of
transportation
that
assigned
all
these
dangers
and
feasibility
problems.
and
this
is
exactly,
by
the
way,
what
seven
courts
have
held
who've
looked
on...
at
propeller
guards
on
the
merits.
they've
held
that
these
devices
are
not
feasible
and
that
they're
dangerous.
there's
not
a
single
court
in
the
united
states
that
has
said
that
these
have
to
be
installed.
and
so,
this
is
the
problem,
the
real
world
problem,
of
having
individual
juries
listen
to
those
who
lost
before
the
administrative
forum
on
propeller
guards.
okay,
we're
going
to
start
all
over
again
in
the
court
system,
and
now
we're
going
to
get
juries
to
start
commanding
installation
of
propeller
guards.
there's
a
real
world
hazard,
a
danger
for
the
public,
and
congress
has
wisely
drafted
this
statute
to
protect
us
and
our
children
against
that
risk.
now,
these
devices
clearly
raise
policy
concerns
of
nationwide
significance
and
that's
why
the
coast
guard
had
to
consider
these
issues
in
proceedings
around
the
country
that
lasted
for
18
months.
many
sectors
of
society
are
affected
by
these
devices,
and
congress
just
did
not
intend
that
individual
juries
were
going
to
make
these
decisions
for
the
whole
country.
this
would
be
extraterritorial
regulation
with
a
vengeance,
just
what
this
court
said
in
locke
should
not
be
done
under
state
law.
now,
my
friend
also
has
argued
in
the
brief
that
safety
is
the
goal
of
the
boat
safety
act,
and
that
uniformity
is
just
a
secondary
concern.
but
congress
did
pursue
its
safety
agenda
through
a
particular
method,
and
that
was
uniform
standards
for
marine
equipment.
congress
wanted
the
whole
nation
to
benefit
from
safe
and
efficient
standards,
and
it
wanted
the
whole
nation
to
be
protected
against
standards
and
requirements
that
represent
risky
experiments.
and
that's
just
what
propeller
guards
are.
and
that's
why
the
coast
guard
said
in
1991
that
these
standards
have
to
meet
stringent
federal
criteria
before
they're
imposed.
and
that
does
bring
us
back
to
congressional
intent
because
when
congress
passed
this
preemption
provision,
the
states
were
starting
to
adopt
requirements
for
battery
covers
and
for
warning
placards
on
boats
and
for
lines
and
anchors.
and
congress
said,
that's
fine,
but
we
can't
have
50
sets
of
these
requirements.
we've
got
to
be
uniform
set
of
these
requirements.
and
it
is
untenable
to
conclude
that
although
the
harbor
master
at
belmont
harbor
cannot
compel
the
installation
of
propeller
guards,
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
is
perfectly
free
to
do
that
with
a
big
threat
of
damages.
both
of
these
are
exercises
of
illinois
law
and
they're
both
preempted.
we
accordingly
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
