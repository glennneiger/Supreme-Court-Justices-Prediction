we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
01-706,
rex
sprietsma
v.
mercury
marine.
ms.
brueckner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
really
is
a
bit
of
a
stretch,
isn't
it,
to
say
you're
talking...
when
you
say
state
law,
you're
only
talking
about
wrongfully
tendered
an
act
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
say
it's
quite
clear...
it
does
not
relieve
a
person
from
liability
at
common
law
or
under
state
law.
whatever
we
may
come
up
with
as
the
meaning
of
that
or
you
may
suggest,
i
don't
think
you
could
say
it's
clear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
guess
you
have
a
different
meaning
of
clear
than
i
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
brueckner.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
he...
is
the
commandant
a
lawyer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
shapiro,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
ms.
brueckner,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brueckner.
the
case
is
submitted.
