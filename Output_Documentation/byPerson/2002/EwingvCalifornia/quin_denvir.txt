mr.
quin
denvir
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
march
2000,
gary
ewing
walked
into
a
los
angeles
pro
shop,
took
three
golf
clubs,
stuck
them
down
the
pants
legs,
and
walked
out.
he
was
quickly
apprehended
for
that
crime.
for
that
crime--
mr.
quin
denvir
--because
the
value
of
the
golf
clubs
was
approximately
$1200,
it
was
grand
theft
under
california
law.
for
grand
theft,
as
a
general
matter,
california
provides
a
maximum
sentence
of
three
years.
it
also...
because
mr.
ewing
had
served
a
prior
prison
sentence,
he
would
be
subject
to
a
recidivism
enhancement
of
one
year,
so
the
maximum
sentence
that
he
would
have
faced
under
california
law,
but
for
the
so-called
"three-strikes
law",
would
have
been
four
years
in
prison,
which
could
have
been
reduced
by
one-half
by
his
conduct
in
prison
and
his
work
in
prison.
however,
because
mr.
ewing
had
a
prior
conviction
for
first-degree
burglary,
which
has
been
classified
as
a
serious
felony
by
california,
and
for
robbery,
which
has
been
classified
as
a
violent
felony
by
california--
mr.
quin
denvir
--he
was
armed
with
a
knife
at
that
time.
and
because
of
those
two
convictions,
he
came
under
the
california
"three
strikes
and
you're
out"
law.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
he
received
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
and
with
a...
with
an
added
bar
that
he
could
not
even
be
considered
for
parole
for
25
years.
mr.
quin
denvir
it
is
correct,
your
honor.
it...
the
judge
did
have
discretion
to
strike
the
priors
or
to
reduce
this
wobbler
offense
to
a
misdemeanor.
she
declined
to
do
so,
partly
on
the
basis
of
his
prior
record.
his
prior
record
were
all
misdemeanor
convictions
prior
to
that
time.
but--
mr.
quin
denvir
--yes,
your
honor.
all
his...
he
had...
the
prior
convictions
that
he
had
were
felonies
were
four
felonies,
all
occurred
within
one
year,
in
19...
in
one
month,
in
1993.
there
were
three
first-degree
burglary
convictions,
and
then
there
was
one
robbery
conviction.
he
had
other--
mr.
quin
denvir
--no,
your
honor.
i
was...
i
thought
justice
kennedy's
question
was
directed
not
to
the...
what
they
call
the
"strike
priors",
but
to
the
fact
that
he
did
have
other--
mr.
quin
denvir
--previous
crimes
that
were
misdemeanors.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
think
that's...
the
sentencing
judge
relied
on
that,
to
some
degree,
in
denying
him
any
discretionary--
mr.
quin
denvir
--relief.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
the
grand
theft
actually
was
a
misdemeanor,
as
we've
shown
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief.
there
was...
there
was
a
misconception
that
that
was
a
felony.
and
in
fact,
it
was
a
misdemeanor
in
ohio,
the
first--
mr.
quin
denvir
--i--
mr.
quin
denvir
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
quin
denvir
is
in--
mr.
quin
denvir
--in
fact,
we've
attached
the
governing
court
records
as
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
that
shows
it
was
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
i
believe
that
he
had
the
four...
the
four
prior
convictions...
the
strike
convictions,
the
felonies,
and
i
think
he
had
another
nine
misdemeanors,
and
then
this
present
offense.
i
think
that's
the--
mr.
quin
denvir
--we
got...
we
got--
mr.
quin
denvir
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
law,
in
itself,
is
not
unreasonable
and
it
could
result
in
a
proportionate
sentence.
it
did
not
in
this
case.
under
this
court's
decision
in
solem
versus
helm,
the
court
has
said
that
you
can
look
to
the
prior
record
as
relevant
to
the
sentencing
decision
because
it
aggravates
the
present
crime,
but
the
focus
must
remain
on
the
present
crime.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
rummel...
the
court
said
in
solem...
the
majority
opinion
said
that
rummel
would
be
controlling
only
in
a
similar
factual
situation.
we
do
not
believe
we
have
that
here.
and
as
far
as
harmelin
was
concerned,
the
basic
principles
of
solem
were
reaffirmed
by
seven
justices
in
harmelin
and,
we
believe,
when
applied
here,
will
show
that
this
is
a
grossly
disproportionate
sentence.
mr.
quin
denvir
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
quin
denvir
--and
to
answer
your
question,
we
are
challenging
only
the
sentence
that
mr.
ewing
received
for
the
crime
that
he
committed,
that
he
was
sentenced
at.
there's
much
discussion
on
both
sides
of...
as...
i...
as
the
background
of
the
three-strikes
law.
we
have
no
doubt
the
three-strikes
law
could
result
in
a...
in
a
constitutional
sentence.
it
did
not,
in
this
case.
so
however
the
scheme
is
that
reached
this
sentence,
this
life
sentence
for
stealing
three
golf
clubs,
that
sentence
is...
falls
under
the
eighth
amendment,
in
our
view.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor,
that
they
don't
play
into
this
case.
and
i
think
that...
as
i
said,
that
the
three-strikes
law
is
merely...
it's
the
process
that
produced
an
unconstitutional
sentence.
it
could
have
been
produced
by
a
different
sentencing
scheme,
also.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that's
true.
in
solem
v.
helm,
the
court
made
very
clear
that
it
was
looking
only
to
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
on
mr.
helm.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor,
the...
in
solem
versus
helm,
the
court,
of
course,
had
a
recidivist
scheme.
the
focus
there
was
on
number
of
prior
offenses,
as
opposed
to
the
nature
of
the
prior
offenses.
the
court
said
that
the
defendant,
under
double-jeopardy
principles,
cannot
be
punished
for
those
prior
crimes;
however,
they
are
relevant
to
the...
to
the
sentence
imposed
for
the
present
crime.
and
the...
and
the
reason
they
are
relative...
and
the
court
said
this
best
in
gryger
versus
burke...
is
what
they...
what
they...
what
they
authorize
is
a,
quote,
"stiffened
penalty
for
the
latest
crime,
which
is
considered
to
be
an
aggravated
offense
because
of
repetitive
one.
"
that's
at
page
8
in
our
reply
brief.
but
what
solem
v.
helm
made
very
clear
is,
although
the
prior
crimes
are
relevant,
the
focus
must
remain,
when
judging
proportionality
or
gross
disproportionality,
on
what
this...
what
this
defendant
did
at
this
time,
what
he
is
being
sentenced
for
at
this
time.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor--
mr.
quin
denvir
--i
think
that
what
the
court
can
say
is
that
his
prior
crimes
are
relevant,
in
the
sense
that
they
make
this
crime
a
more
aggravated
crime
than
a
crime
committed
by
a
first
offender--
mr.
quin
denvir
--and
that
there
can
be
a
reasonable
enhancement
for
that.
but
in
this
case,
he
has
been
sentenced
to...
he
has...
his
sentence
has
gone
from
a
maximum
of
three
years
for
a
first
offender
to
life,
all
based
on
the
recidivism.
mr.
quin
denvir
at
that
point--
mr.
quin
denvir
--your
honor,
if
he,
in
fact,
committed
a
crime
at
this
point
that
was
a
serious
or
a
violent
crime,
they
may
have
a
basis,
but
what
the
court
has
said
very
clearly
is
that--
mr.
quin
denvir
--is
the
focus
remains
on
this,
because
otherwise--
mr.
quin
denvir
--he's
being
punished
for
the
prior
crimes.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because,
as
i
say,
what
the
court
has
said
over
the
years
is
that
the
important
part
about
the
prior
crimes
is
that
it
shows
that
this
is
a
repeat
offense.
and
the
fact
that
he
has
committed
offenses
in
a
row
makes
this
particular
offense
worse.
the
fact
that
he
has
committed
worse
offenses
in
the
past
does
not
aggravate
this
crime.
i...
this
is...
this
still
remains
shoplifting
three
golf
clubs,
regardless
if
he
had
been
a
triple
murderer
or
anything
else,
and
that's
what
he's
being
punished
for.
because
if
he's
being
punished
because
of
those
prior
crimes,
their
nature,
there's
really
serious
double
jeopardy--
mr.
quin
denvir
--your
honor,
i...
the...
if
you...
if
you
look
at
our--
mr.
quin
denvir
--well,
your
honor,
if
you
look
to
our...
to
the
comparison
with
other
jurisdictions...
and
i
just
don't
think
this
has
been
highlighted
in
our
brief...
there
are
only...
there
are
only
five
jurisdictions
that
would
have
allowed
a
life
sentence.
there's
only
one
additional
jurisdiction,
montana,
that
would
have
allowed
a
term
of
years
as
great
as
the
minimum
sentence
here,
and
that's...
montana
allows...
is
five
to
a
hundred
years.
and
most
states
allow
for
either
grand
theft
or
recidivist
grand
theft--
mr.
quin
denvir
--ten
years
at
the
most.
mr.
quin
denvir
no,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
solem
v.
helm,
the
court
noted
that
he
could...
that
mr.
helm
could
have
received
a
comparable
sentence
in
one
other
state,
and
nevertheless
held
that
it
fell
under
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your--
mr.
quin
denvir
--your
honor,
and...
what
i'm
saying
is...
i'm
going
back
to
what
the
court
said
in
solem
v.
helm
in
its
analysis,
which
i
think
is
controlling
here.
it
made...
it
made
the
point
that
the...
the
prior
convictions...
he
cannot
be
punished
for
those,
but
they
do
aggravate
this
present
crime
that
he's
being
punished
for.
and
the
way
they
aggravate
it
is
that...
is
that
this
shows
that
it's
a
repetitive
offense.
now,
he
can
have
a
reasonable
enhancement
of
the
normal
penalty
for
grand
theft
based
on
the
repetition
aspect
of
it,
but
at
some
point
it
becomes
unreasonable.
and
it
becomes
unreasonable
if
you
go
from
three
years
to
life
based
on
his
prior
crimes.
at
that--
mr.
quin
denvir
--because
of
the
nature
of
the
crime
that
he
committed,
which
is
stealing
three
golf
clubs,
a
crime
that
is
not
deemed
either
serious
or
violent
under
california
law.
mr.
quin
denvir
it
is
a
felony.
it's
actually
a
wobbler
and
could
be
charged
either
way.
mr.
quin
denvir
but
in
this
case,
it's
a
felony.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor,
if
that
were
true,
then
there
would
be
no
limiting
principle
on
recidivist
laws
under
the
eighth
amendment.
it
would...
at
that
point,
you
could
say
the
mere
fact
that
he
broke
any
law...
if
he
broke
a
traffic
offense...
a
petty
offense
would
show
that
he
couldn't
follow
the
law
and
could
get
a
life
sentence.
mr.
quin
denvir
it
is
a
felony,
and
it's
one
of
the
least
grave
felonies
in
california.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor,
i
think
you
do,
because,
as
i
understand
the
harmelin
case,
if
you
take
the
dissent
and
the
plurality,
they
both
agreed
on
the
basic
principle
here,
which
is
that
there
cannot
be
gross
disproportion
between
the
offense
and
the
sentence.
and
the
reason
i
go
back
to
solem
versus
helm
is
that
it
was
a
recidivist
case
and
there
was
some
further
information.
i
don't...
as
i
read
the
court's
opinion,
at
least
the
plurality
opinion,
in
harmelin,
the
big
change
was
that
you
would...
you
would
not
look
automatically
to
intra-jurisdictional
or
inter-jurisdictional
comparisons.
you
would
first
have
to
find
an
inference
of
gross
disproportionality
before
you'd
go
to
the
second...
the
other
two
steps.
that's
what
i
understood
to
be
the
major...
the
major
refinement
of
solem
v.
helm
that
was
in
the
plurality
opinion.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor--
mr.
quin
denvir
--i...
let
me
see
if
i
can
answer
your
question.
as
far
as
under
the
three-strikes
law,
there
is...
because
it
sets
this
absolute
minimum
of
25
years...
it's
a
life
sentence,
but
it
adds
a
kicker
to
it
which
says,
unlike
other
life
sentences,
you
have
to
wait
at
least
25
years
before
you
can
even
be
considered.
so
we...
since
this
law
was
passed
in
1994,
we
have
no
experience
with
this
law.
mr.
quin
denvir
right.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor--
mr.
quin
denvir
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
understand--
mr.
quin
denvir
--your--
mr.
quin
denvir
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't...
i...
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
answer
that,
but
let
me
see
if
i
can
answer
it
in
a
different
way.
but
for
the
three-strike
law,
mr.
ewing,
with
his
record,
could
receive
no
more
than
four
years.
now,
there
are
other
recidivist
laws
in
california
besides
the
three-strike
law.
mr.
quin
denvir
they
could,
your
honor,
and
california
is--
mr.
quin
denvir
--i
think
that's
right.
i
think
the
long
sentence...
the...
california
substituted
determinate
sentencing
law
for
indeterminate
in
1977,
and...
but
under
the
old
indeterminate
sentencing
law,
my
clear
recollection
is
that
those
long,
indeterminate
sentences
were
always
triggered
by
serious
or
violent
felonies,
and
that
is
something
that--
mr.
quin
denvir
--no?
mr.
quin
denvir
and--
mr.
quin
denvir
--well,
your
honor,
if
you
look
for
the
question
of
parole
in
california,
which
the...
which
the
state
suggests
is...
saves
his
life
sentence,
the
court
looked
at
this
in
1995
in
the
case
california
department
of
corrections
versus
moralez.
and
what
the
court
said
at
that
time
was
that
90
percent
of
all
defendants
who
came
up
for
their
first
parole
hearing
were
found
unsuitable
for
parole
and
that
85
percent
were
found
unsuitable
at
subsequent
hearings.
now,
that
has
not
improved
any,
because,
as
you'll
see
in
the
amicus
brief
of
families
against
mandatory
minimums,
at
page
18,
as
of
2000,
the
board
of
prison
terms,
which
is
the...
which
is
the
parole
authority...
their
official
records
show
that
they
only
recommended
parole
in
1
percent
of
the
2000
cases
that
came
before
them
with
a
life
sentence.
mr.
quin
denvir
by
both,
your
honor.
mr.
quin
denvir
both
by
legislature
and
by--
mr.
quin
denvir
--well--
mr.
quin
denvir
--your
honor,
first
of
all,
as
to
the
question
of
initiative
versus
legislation,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
court,
in
other
areas,
has
said
that
there's
no
greater
deference
given
to
one
than
the
other.
but
the
other
question
is,
there's
no
doubt
that
some
deference
has
to
be
paid
by
this
court
to
legislative
judgments
or
initiative
judgments
in
the
questions
of
punishment
and
in
dealing
with
recidivists.
the
court
has
made
that
very
clear.
but
it
is
that
deference
that
has
led
to
the
court
setting
a
very
forgiving
standard.
the
court
said
that
it
would
not
require,
in
this
area,
or
as
excessive
fines,
strict
proportionality
between
the
crime
being
punished
and
the
sentence.
it
has
said
it
was
only
when
there
was
a
gross
disproportion,
and
that's
a
very
deferential
standard.
that
is
a
standard
that
allows
the
legislature
to
make
many
reasonable
judgments,
but
says
that--
mr.
quin
denvir
--some
judgments
are
unreasonable.
mr.
quin
denvir
well,
your
honor--
mr.
quin
denvir
--life
imprisonment
for...
for
the
crime
of
stealing
three
golf
clubs,
we
believe,
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor--
mr.
quin
denvir
--your
honor,
the
sentence
that
he's
been
given
is
life
in
prison.
he's
been
consigned
to
die
in
prison
unless
some
administrative
agency
determines
to
let
him
out.
and
as
i've
just
quoted
you--
mr.
quin
denvir
--and
he
might
be,
but
on...
there
is
no...
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
would
suggest
he
has
a
reasonable
expectation
in
that
regard.
in
fact...
in
fact,
what's
before
the
court
would
suggest
that
there
is
not
a
reasonable
expectation,
particularly
if
the
animus
that
drives...
that
drove
the
passage
of
this
law
continues
for
25
years
and
they
still
think,
"well,
gee,
if
they
committed
these
prior
crimes,
they
ought
to
be
locked
up
for
life,
because
they
may
commit
other
crimes.
"
mr.
quin
denvir
those
are
not
three-strikes
cases.
mr.
quin
denvir
that's
correct.
mr.
quin
denvir
he
is
alive,
your
honor.
he
is--
mr.
quin
denvir
--he's
lost...
he's
aged
and
has
lost
eyesight
in
one
eye
as
a
result,
but
he's
still
alive
at
this
point--
mr.
quin
denvir
--he
was
38
years
old.
he's
40
years
old
now.
so--
mr.
quin
denvir
--as
a
practical
matter...
i
mean,
this...
25
years
is
probably
a
life
sentence
for
him,
unless
there's
some
major
medical
development
that--
mr.
quin
denvir
--your
honor,
i...
if...
i
misspoke.
what
we
say
is
the
focus
must
be
on
the
present
offense.
it
is
an
aggravated
offense.
he
is
a
repeat--
mr.
quin
denvir
--a
repeat
offender.
he
is
a
repeat
offender.
he
is
someone
who
committed
this
offense
with
a
prior
record
of
offenses.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
think
it
is,
in
the
sense
that
it
shows
that
there
has...
there
has
been
some...
there
has
been
a
series
of
repetition.
but
what
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that
regardless
of
the
repetition,
the
fact
that
it's
a
repetitive
offense,
if
the
focus
remains
on
what
he
did
now,
the
triggering
offense,
which,
under
solem
v.
helm,
is
the
focus,
then
no
matter
what
he
has
done
in
the
past,
no
matter
how
much
repetition,
it
is...
it
is
grossly
disproportional
to
sentence
him
to
a
life
sentence.
at
that
point--
mr.
quin
denvir
--your
honor,
if
there...
if
there
were
a...
if
there
were
a
series
of
crimes
of
the
same
nature...
for
instance,
if
there--
mr.
quin
denvir
--yes.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
would...
that
would
show
a
propensity
to
steal
golf
clubs,
but,
again,
i
don't
believe--
mr.
quin
denvir
--i
don't
believe--
mr.
quin
denvir
--he
shouldn't
be
penalized
for
that.
that
may
be
beyond
his
control.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
believe
that
life
is,
because
it
is
still...
the
crime
that
has
to
be
punished...
i
mean,
and
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
solem
v.
helm...
this
is--
mr.
quin
denvir
--you
know,
in
solem
v.
helm--
mr.
quin
denvir
--your
honor,
i...
your
honor,
there's
no
doubt
that
the
prior
record...
and
the
court
has
said
that
is
relevant
to
the
punishment
for
the
present
crime,
and
it
does
aggravate
it.
but
there
are
limits
to
how
aggravated
shoplifting
three
golf
clubs
can
be,
no
matter
what
has
happened
before--
mr.
quin
denvir
--your
honor,
it's
still
three...
it's
still
stealing
three
golf
clubs.
it's
not
robbery,
rape,
murder,
or
something
of
that
nature.
i
mean,
it
is...
it
is
still
there.
i
mean,
the...
to
raise
your
question,
what
if
someone
had
a
long
history
of
jay-walking
and
had
seven
or
ten
or
a
hundred
convictions
for
jay-walking
and
jay-walked
again?
i
think
the
court
would
not
say
you
could
get
a
life
sentence
for
that
just--
mr.
quin
denvir
--because
it's
repetitive.
mr.
quin
denvir
it
hurts
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
property
crime
and
causes--
mr.
quin
denvir
--a
loss,
that's
correct.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
i--
mr.
quin
denvir
--your...
it
is...
it
is,
your
honor,
and
i
think--
mr.
quin
denvir
--and
i
think
that
if
there
had
been
some...
some
violence
that
had
actually
occurred
out
of
this,
then
he
undoubtedly
would
have
been
punished
under
a
different
statute
with
higher--
mr.
quin
denvir
--but
your
honor,
california
determined
that
when
it
set
the
ranges
for
grand
theft--
mr.
quin
denvir
--if
the
court
has
further
questions,
i'd
rather
answer
the
questions--
mr.
quin
denvir
--than
reserve
time.
mr.
quin
denvir
california
considered
that
when
they
set
the
penalties
for
grand
theft.
and
they
set
the
penalty
as
a
maximum
of
three
years
in
prison.
if
they
set
different
penalties
for
grand
theft
from
a
person,
and
for
robbery,
there
is...
there
is...
all
those
things
are
taken
into
consideration
here.
and
the
fact
that
this
could
have
eventuated
into
something
else,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it
did
not.
and
in
fact,
if
anything,
mr.
ewing
seemed
to
be
doing
everything
he
can
to
be...
to
get
out
of
there
undetected,
if
that...
if
you
look
at
the
facts
of
this
crime.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
have
no
idea
how
he
could
have
done
that.
it
seems
to
me
a
miracle
that
he
could
have...
actually
got
out
the
door,
but
he
apparently
did.
he's
not
a
very
tall
man,
as
i
recall.
mr.
quin
denvir
i
think--
mr.
quin
denvir
--i
think
he
was
planning
on
removing
them
before
he
used
them,
i
take
it--
mr.
quin
denvir
--your
honor,
i
would
reserve
any
additional
time,
unless
there's
additional
questions.
mr.
quin
denvir
thank
you.
mr.
quin
denvir
your
honor,
the
point
i...
i'd
like
to
make
two
points.
one
is,
if
the
discretion
in...
under
the
california
law
is
very
limited.
one
thing
would
be
to
treat
a
wobbler,
if
it
is
a
wobbler,
and
reduce
it
to
a
misdemeanor;
so
you
would
go
from
25
to
life,
or
life,
to
one-year
maximum
penalty.
that's
not
used
very
often.
the
other
one
is
to
strike
a
prior
conviction.
but
that's
a...
the
california
supreme
court
in
romero
said
that's
a
very
limited
discretion,
that
it
is
only
when
you
can
find
that
this
offender
is
outside
the
"spirit
of
the
law",
whatever
that
is.
and
there's
an
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
los
angeles
public
defender
in
romero
that
shows
that
that
discretion
has
been
used
very
little
in
california.
so
the...
this
limited
discretion
has
no
effect
on
it.
the
only
other
point
i'd
make,
as
far
as
the
repetition...
as
far
as
the
labeling,
if
all
the
legislature
has
to
do
is
say,
"what
we're
doing
here
is
incapacitation,
and,
therefore,
the
court
can't
look
at
that.
"
then
it
really
writes
the
eighth
amendment
protections
against
grossly
disproportional
sentences
out
totally.
if
it's
just
a
question
of...
they
say,
"here's
our
reason",
and
you
can't
even
question
that,
because
they
can
always
claim
they
want
to
incapacitate
any
criminal
for
any
amount
of
time.
