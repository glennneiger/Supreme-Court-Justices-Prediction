mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
i
think,
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
i
don't
know
what
the
statistics
are
under
the
old
indeterminate
sentencing
law
that
was
in
effect
in
california
until
1976.
but
in
a
way,
i
think
the...
your
honor's
question
triggers
an
issue
that
i
think
is
central
here.
the
isl,
the
old
california
law,
was
premised
very
explicitly
on
a
penological
theory
that
emphasized
rehabilitation
of
the
offender.
i
think
the
question
that's
raised
in
this
case,
and
it's
a
question
that's
particularly
apt
in
light
of
the
harmelin
opinion,
is,
when
can
a
state
decide
that
they're
going
to
move
away
from
a
more
lenient
policy
of
rehabilitation
or
extending
leniency
to
a
first-time
offender,
and
move
toward
a
policy,
a
tougher
policy,
of
incapacitation?
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well,
again,
your
honor,
i...
the...
my
answer
is
that
i
do
not
know
what
those
records
would
have
shown.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes,
and
i
did
interpret
the
issue
to
be
a
proportionality
issue
rather
than
an
unusualness
issue.
but
i
do...
something
in
the
recesses
of
my
mind
tells
me
that
we
had
a
three-time
loser
statute
in
california,
and
i
think
that
put
people
away
for
life
without
parole.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well,
in
our
view,
the
most
prominent,
kind
of,
objective
factor
that
this
court
could
look
to
in
weighing
this
sentence
is
what
the
legislature
has
said
are
felonies.
what
california
has
done
in
this
case
is,
they've
narrowed
their
target
to
a
subclass
of
felons
who
have
committed
what
the
legislature
has
deemed
to
be...
and
i
think
what,
on
the
face
of
it,
can
reasonably
interpreted
as
being...
serious
or
violent
crimes.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
four
hundred
dollars,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
now
it's
$100
if
it's
citrus.
[laughter]
but
once
there
is
that
predicate
of
serious
or
violent
felonies
set
in
place,
then
what
the
three-strikes
law
does
is,
i
think,
reasonably
moves
toward
a
policy
of
incapacitation
upon
the
commission
of,
not
just
any
new
crime,
not
a
misdemeanor
or
an
infraction,
but
a
new
crime
that
the
legislature
has--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--no,
your
honor.
the
way
the
statute
is
written
is
that
if
the
prior
felonies
meet
the
statutory
definition
of
being
serious
or
violent...
if
you
have
two
of
those,
then
any
new
felony
triggers
the
three-strike
sentence.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes,
because
wobblers
are
felonies,
by
definition,
in
california,
and
any
felony
qualifies.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
as
long
as
the
first
two
strikes
meet
the
level
of
being
serious
or
violent,
which--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well,
we...
in
california,
the
felony
is
defined
by
the...
not
just
the
locus
of
where
the
term
will
be
served,
but
also
by
the
length.
it's
more
than
a
year.
and
we
think
that
that's
a
traditional
line
of
demarcation
between
offenses
that,
over
the
course
of
time,
society
deems
to
be
of
elevated
seriousness.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
so,
and
there
are
political
restraints
on
the
legislature
in
enacting
laws
in
general
applicability.
there
are
certainly
economic
restraints
on
a
legislature
in
deciding
to
set
a
punishment
scheme
that
provides
for
long
terms
of
imprisonment.
that's
costly.
and
that
to...
for
a
court
to
second-guess
that,
comes,
we
think,
perilously
close
to
the
court
suggesting
that
the
legislature
can,
in
some
instances,
not
declare
a
certain
crime
to
be
a
felony,
but
must
declare
it
to
be
a
misdemeanor,
and
we
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
court's
jurisprudence
that
would...
that
would
support
that
type
of
an
intrusion.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
there
are
no
statewide
standards.
each
elected
district
attorney
in
the
various
counties
in
california
has
the
option
of
promulgating
guidelines.
some
of
them
have.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
some
of
them...
some
of
them
differ.
we
think
that's
a
rather
unremarkable
event
in
light
of
the
fact
that
prosecutorial
discretion
is
always
going
to
lead
to
some
sort
of
different
approach
depending
on
local
conditions.
but
there
is
not,
as
far
as
i
know,
any
statewide
guideline,
and
certainly
nothing
that
would
be
binding
on
the
local
prosecutors.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes,
the
prosecutor,
under
the
statute,
is
required
to
allege
the
priors,
but
the
prosecutor
may
seek
dismissal
of
the
prior
strikes
either
in
the
furtherance
of
justice,
or
because
of
problems
of
proof.
but
the
judge
also
has
authority
to
strike
strikes,
even
without
the
consent
of
the
prosecutor,
in
california.
and
so--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--yes,
the
prosecutor,
in
a
way,
has
that
discretion,
because
he
or
she
can
charge
a...
an
alternative
felony
or
misdemeanor
as
a
misdemeanor
in
the
first
place,
but
even
under
the
three-strikes
law,
the
trial
judge
retains
the
discretion
to
sentence
a...
an
alternative
felony
misdemeanor
as
a
misdemeanor,
and
that
would
take
the
case
out
of
the
three-strikes
scope.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well,
we
think
that
might
possibly
be
constitutional,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--might
possibly
be
constitutional.
i
think
it's
more
likely
that
it
would
be--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--well,
because
i
think
the
limiting
principle
that
we're
seeking
here,
your
honor,
is
one
that's
premised
on
the
felony
classification.
if
the--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--it...
i
think
it
would
make
the
constitutional...
it
might
change
the
constitutional
analysis.
it
might
make
the
result
different.
i
think,
again,
once
you
have
the
predicate
in
place
of
the
serious
or
violent
felonies,
then
i
think
the
reason
you're--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--no,
your
honor.
if...
the
prior
crimes
have
to
qualify
as
serious
or
violent
under
the
definitions
of
a
separate
statutory
scheme,
so
they
would
not--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--yes,
i
think
that's
true.
there
are
serious
crimes
where
no
injury
is
inflicted,
but
the
crimes,
i
think,
by
their
nature,
tend
to
be
crimes
where
the
prospect
of
violence
is
rather
imminent.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
no,
i
think...
i
think--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--i...
again,
your
honor,
i...
it's
a...
it's
a
much
tougher
call.
i
think
it
might
be
permissible
to
do
it,
provided
that
the
sentence
allows
for
a
possibility
of
parole,
after
the--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--yes.
that
would
distinguish
it
from
solem,
your
honor.
but
nevertheless,
here,
the
predicate,
even
though
the
prior
crimes
don't
necessarily
have
to
involve
the
actual
infliction
of
violence,
they
are
crimes
that
by
their
nature--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--well,
i
think
it
might
be
a
sliding
scale,
but
i
think
violence
does
play
a
significant
role
and
can
justify
a
scheme
like
this,
even
in
the
absence--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--of
a
great
number
of
priors.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well,
we
think
a
lot
would
depend
on
whether
the
legislature
in
the
jurisdiction
had
determined
for...
for...
on
an
historical
basis
and
for
reasons
independent--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--but
we
think...
if
the
legislature
declares
those
to
be
a
felony,
then
i
think
we
become
a
lot...
we
come
a
lot
closer
to--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--yes,
it
does,
your
honor,
in
a
very
significant
respect,
because
what
the
legislature
calls
the
offense
in
connection
with
it
being
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony
does
reflect,
we
think,
a
reliable
longstanding
consensus
of
the...
of
the
community.
and
under
the
harmelin
principles
of
deference
and
reliance
and
objective
factors,
we
think
that's
a
prominent
objective
factor.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well,
again,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--yes.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
i
do
think
that
it
is
a
much
tougher
case
for
us,
and
i'm
not
at
all
certain
that
it
would
be
constitutional
if
all
of
the
crimes,
the
predicate
through
the
new
crime,
were
simply
speeding.
i
think--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--well,
i
don't...
in
the
california
context,
the
question
would
only
arise...
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
arise
at
all,
because
you
wouldn't
have
a
speeding...
even
as
a
predicate,
any
felony-triggering
events,
and
the
speeding
wouldn't
qualify
as
a
serious
or
violent
felony
under
the
statute
anyway.
so
this
hypothetical
is
very
far
removed
from
the
three-strikes
scheme
that
california
has
in
place.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--well,
again,
your
honor,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
i
would
absolutely
concede
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
i'm
just
saying
that--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--yes,
we
do
adopt
the
theory
of
incapacitation,
and
we
do
rely
on
incapacitation
as
a
theory
that
justifies
the
sentence
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well,
i
think
it
becomes
much
more
difficult,
but
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
becomes
logically
impossible,
because
i
think
there
is
still
room
for
judicial
scrutiny,
within
the
context
of
the
harmelin
narrow
proportionality
principle,
to
take
a
hard
look--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--well,
but
i
think
the
court
can
still
look
at
whether
the
phenomenon
of...
as
in
this
case,
of
heightened
recidivism
based
on
prior
violence,
or
serious
offenses
threatening
violence
and
triggered
by
a
new
crime
that,
say...
that's
classified
as
a
felony
by
the
legislature
and
that
offers
a
sentence
of...
a
lengthy
sentence,
but
that
still
offers
a
possibility
of
parole--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--yes,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--it...
and
i
acknowledge
it...
to
justice
souter,
it
makes
it
a
very
difficult
situation.
but
under
harmelin,
those,
i
think,
are
penological
objectives
that
the
judiciary
ought
to
defer
to
the
state.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
no,
your
honor.
it
disables
the
states
from
changing...
from
dealing
with
changing
conditions.
