justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
slightly
stuck
on
this,
because
i...
i'd
like...
there
is
some
relevant
information
that
i
can't
get
a
hold
of,
and
you
may
some
in
your
experience,
but
it
isn't
in
the
brief.
imagine...
let's
take
the
set
of
people
who
have
committed
at
least
two
serious
crimes
or
more,
maybe
50
serious
crimes.
they're
very
serious
criminals.
and
they're
warned,
"if
you
do
anything
again,
you've
had
it.
"
so
think
of
that
set
of
people.
now,
i
would
like
to
know,
in
light
of
that
set
of
people,
now
one
of
the
members
of
that
set
commits
a
crime
equal
to
stealing
$1200...
whether
they
steal
$1200
or
equal
to
that;
that's
a
very
subjective
judgment...
what's
the
longest
sentence
such
a
person
has
ever
actually
served?
here,
they
are
going
to
25
years,
real
years.
and
the
second
question
i'd
like
to
know
is,
what
is
the
least
bad
crime
that
such
a
person
ever
committed
who
did
serve
25
real
years?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
to
know
both
of
those
things.
and,
obviously,
they're
find-outable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
obviously,
i
don't
want
experience--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--under
this
law.
that
would
be
circular.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
looking
for
is,
in
the
absence
of
this
law--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
the
absence
of
this
law,
what
is
the
longest
sentence
a
person
like
yours...
and
i'm
defining
1200.
and
there's
loads
of
records...
i
mean,
in
the
california
adult
authority
before
this
law
was
passed,
et
cetera.
and
the
second
question
is,
what
is
the
least
bad
thing
such
a
person
who
really
served
25
years
did?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that...
those
are
empirical
questions,
and
you're
talking
about
this
being
unusual.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
the
california
adult
authority,
which
was
only
the
law
in
california
for
70
years,
people
could
receive
very,
very,
very
long
sentences.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
not
this
long
for
this
thing,
but...
but...
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
they...
i've
looked
it
up,
actually--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you're
quite
right
that
this
is
not
as...
you
couldn't
get
this
long
a
sentence,
but
you
could
get
a
pretty
long
one
for
being
a
third
offender
and
committing
a
property
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i...
that
doesn't
tell
us
how
long
the
people
actually
served.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
not
life
imprisonment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
25
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
25
years
that
he'll
really
serve.
we
know
that.
as
far
as...
what
happens
after
those
25
years
is
a
matter
of
parole
or
a
decision
by
other
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
mean,
parole,
in
all
the
cases
you're
citing,
is
relevant,
so
you
can
describe
it
as
you
want.
we
both
know
what
the
facts
are.
the
facts
are
he
has
to
be
in
jail
for
at
least
25
years,
and
then
he
might
be
paroled.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
tell
me,
am
i
fair
to
say
assume
there
never,
in
the
history
of
the
united
states,
has
been
a
person
who...
of
the
set...
i'm
only...
i
don't
want
to
be
pejorative;
i
want
to
characterize
it
your
way,
and
i'll
characterize
it
as
taking
the
set
of
very
serious
criminals
with
very
serious
records,
and
a
person
in
that
set
commits
another
crime,
and
the
other
crime
is
approximately
theft
of
$1200...
and
am
i
fair
in
saying
there
hasn't
been,
ever,
a
sentence
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
in
the
last
hundred
years
anywhere
close
to
this
one?
and
i
base
that
on
my
knowledge...
which
you
could
get;
it's
public...
of
35,000
real
cases
in
the
federal
system
where
to
get
a
sentence
like
this
one
for
a
prior
offender,
you
had
to...
you
have
to
now,
you
know,
hijack
an
airplane,
commit
murder,
something
really
serious
beyond
belief
compared
to
this,
and
that
the
worst
sentence
you
could
get
for
something
like
this
is
about
four,
five
years.
and
then
i
look
to
the
california
adult
authority,
and
i
see,
under
that
sentencing,
nobody
could
have
gotten
more
than
ten
real
years,
and,
indeed,
the
average
was
somewhere
around
five.
and
you
have
all
those
records,
and
you
have
come
up
with
nothing
in
your
brief.
and
therefore,
can
i
say...
my
assumption
is,
this
is
by
an
order
or
factor
of
two
or
three
times
higher
than
anyone
ever
was
sentenced
before
in
the
united
states
for
such
a
thing?
you
see,
i'm
making
a
very
extreme
statement
empirically,
and
i
want
to
know
what
the
response
is
to
my
statement,
and
i
want
to
know
why
i
shouldn't
hold
you
to
my
statement
since
you
have
the
information,
and
why
i
shouldn't
say
that's
just
way
too
much.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right,
how
do
we
decide...
how
do
we
decide
if
you
say,
of
this
serious
set
of
criminals,
you
go
to
jail
for
life
if
you
jay-walk...
i
mean,
the
next
time.
is
that...
is
that
disproportionate?
how
am
i
supposed
to
say
what
is
or
was...
is
not
if
i
don't
look
to
the
empirical
facts?
and
i'm
not
holding
you
to
present
empirical
facts.
i'm
just
saying,
why
shouldn't
i
decide
on
the
basis
of
empirical
fact
that
is
available?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
also,
i
don't
know
how
to
work
with
felony
and
misdemeanor,
because,
across
the
nation,
my
impression
is
that
those
are
classified
in
very
different
ways,
and
they
are
classified
sometimes
according
to
the
prison
that
you
serve
in,
as
in
massachusetts,
and
sometimes
you
can
find
a
felony
that,
in
ordinary
common
sense,
is
a
lot
less
serious
than
certain
misdemeanors.
that's
why
i'm
very
pushed
to
know
what
to
work
with
unless
you
work
with
empirical
fact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
justice
stevens'
hypo,
taking
it
one
step
further,
i
guess
we
would
have
to
say
that
if
there
were
15
prior
speeding
offenses,
and
they
had
been
classified
as
felonies
in
california,
that
there
was
no
disproportion
between
25-to-life
for
15...
with
a
predicate
of
15
prior
speeding
offenses,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
penalties
for
torture
and
murder,
on
the
other
hand.
because
i
think
it's
undisputed
that
the
only
standalone
penalties
that
are
this
great
are
the
penalties
for
torture
and
homicide.
that
would
be
rather
a
stretch,
wouldn't
it,
regardless
of
whether
the
legislature
wants
to
put
a
felony
label
on
them
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
speeding's
important,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
torture
and
murder?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
isn't
that
this
case?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
to
approach
proportionality
other
than
to
say,
what
sentences
are
given
for
the
same
crime,
or
what
crimes
are
treated
with
the
same
sentence?
now,
suppose,
looking
at
that,
i
find
this
is
the
rare
case.
if
it
isn't,
why
isn't
it?
i
mean,
all
the
information
we
have,
as
i've
said
before,
seems
to
suggest
that
this
is
higher
by
a
factor
of
two
or
three
times
anything
else
you
can
find.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
cited
a
lot
of
instances
in
which
the
law
permits
such
a
sentence,
but
that's
quite
different
from
saying
there
was
such
a
sentence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
do
you
have
instances
where
people
were
sentenced
to
25
real
years
in
prison
for
having
committed
such
an
offense?
or
were
you
citing
that
the
law
would
permit
such
a
sentence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good,
okay,
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
that
would
be
a
very
bad
thing.
i
agree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
justice
o’connor
said,
justice
stevens,
justice
souter,
justice
ginsburg
and
i
dissent
that
the
crime
at
issue
here
consists
of
theft
of
three
golf
clubs
with
a
sticker
price
totaling
$1,197.
the
offender
has
a
prior
criminal
record
that
includes
four
prior
felony
convictions
arising
out
of
three
burglaries,
one
with
a
knife.
the
sentence
consists
of
twenty
five
years
of
real
prison
time
not
mitigated
by
any
possibility
of
parole.
the
legal
question
is
whether
this
sentence
is
grossly
disproportionate.
in
answering
this
question,
we
recognize,
the
four
of
us,
what
this
court
has
previously
held.
first,
the
eighth
amendment
does
apply
to
a
sentence
for
a
term
of
years;
second,
the
constitution
does
leave
the
states
with
great
sentencing
leeway
forbidding
only
the
rare
sentence
at
the
outer
bound,
and
third,
it
is
important
for
courts
to
apply
objective
criteria
in
so
far
as
possible.
we
have
tried
to
apply
reasonably
objective
criteria
and
our
conclusion
is
that
this
case
does
present
that
rare
case
where
a
punishment
is
grossly
disproportionate.
in
our
view,
comparative
sentencing
practices
provide
the
most
reliable
objective
measure
of
proportionality,
but
we
accept,
at
least
for
argument’s
sake,
the
majority's
view
that
we
should
make
these
comparisons
only
after
first
determining
that
a
sentence
crosses
a
legal
threshold,
a
threshold
that
we
assume
is
designed
to
separate
whether
perfectly
innocuous
sheep
from
the
potential
goats.
the
sentence
here,
in
our
view,
does
fall
within
that
potential
goat
category.
for
one
thing,
it
is
similar
to
but
not
identical
with
the
recidivist
sentence
that
this
court
struck
down
in
solem
versus
helm,
the
real
time
sentence
in
this
case
is
shorter.
it
is
twenty
five
years
without
parole
compared
with
life
without
parole
in
solem,
but
that
difference
twenty
five
years
versus
life
simply
puts
this
case
into
a
twilight
zone
of
legal
uncertainty.
that
uncertainty
adding
plausibility
to
the
defendant’s
legal
attack
helps
the
sentence
cross
the
legal
threshold.
for
another
thing,
it
amounts
to
application
of
one
of
the
most
severe
punishments
available
to
one
of
the
less
severe
forms
of
criminal
behavior.
however
we
measure
that
conduct
severity,
including
which
we
do
through
use
of
the
government’s
own
criteria.
finally,
experienced
judges,
namely
those
who
sentenced
offenders
in
the
40,000
actual
proceedings
upon
which
the
federal
sentencing
commission
based
its
federal
guideline,
apparently
also
would
have
thought
this
sentence
unduly
harsh.
for
the
commission
use
neither
prior
shoplifting
nor
other
similar
theft
defenses
as
a
basis
for
specially
augmenting
a
recidivist
sentence.
so,
we
conclude
at
the
least
the
court
should
have
undertaken
a
comparative
sentence
analysis.
now,
the
comparative
sentence
analysis
here
shows
that
this
sentence
before
us
is
out
of
line
and
by
a
considerable
degree
with
prior
sentencing
practice
in
california
as
well
as
prior
and
present
sentencing
practices
in
other
states
and
in
the
federal
system.
when
we
make
the
determination,
we
note
that
what
matters
is
real
time
served,
not
the
time
that
sentencing
statutes
authorized,
and
we
asked
two
questions:
first,
how
do
other
jurisdictions
punish
similar
offenders
namely
recidivists
who
engage
in
similar
conduct?
second,
for
what
other
form
of
criminal
conduct
do
other
jurisdictions
reserve
this
kind
of
severe
punishment,
twenty
five
real
years
in
jail?
i
would
summarize
our
answers
as
follows:
as
to
the
first
question,
the
state
supported
by
the
federal
government
has
found
precisely
one
relevant
example
of
another
jurisdiction's
similar
sentence
outside
this
california
three-strike
law
context.
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
fall
that
there
is
only
one
does
not
lie
in
the
research.
after
all,
it
would
be
illegal
to
impose
a
sentence
anywhere
near
twenty
five
real
prison
years
in
all
but
a
handful
of
states,
and
even
as
to
those
latter
handful,
there
is
very
little
reason
to
believe
that
judges
do
impose
the
maximum
sentence
that
the
law
in
those
few
states
permits
them
to
impose.
given
a
present
population
approaching
two
million,
that
single
example
of
a
relevant
similar
sentence
that
state
and
federal
governments
together
have
been
able
to
find
suggest
that
outside
contemporary
california
such
sentences
are
truly
unusual.
it
does
not
suggest
the
contrary.
as
to
the
second
question,
the
kind
of
conduct
that
this
type
of
severe
punishment
is
reserved
for
in
other
jurisdiction
twenty
five
years
real
time,
in
those
other
jurisdictions,
the
kind
of
conduct
involves
recidivists
who
go
on
to
commit
murder,
air
piracy,
drug
offenses
involving
what
we
say
twenty
pounds
of
heroine,
robbery
involving
serious
bodily
injury
in
a
million
dollars
and
so
forth.
in
california
before
the
three-strikes
law,
90%
of
all
nonrecidivists
first-degree
murderers
served
less
than
twenty
real
years
in
prison,
and
even
now,
california
caps
prison
time
at
ten
years
or
less
for
nonrecidivist
crimes
such
as
voluntary
manslaughter
and
arson
involving
great
bodily
injury.
it
reserves
ewing
sentence
twenty
five
real
years
for
nonrecidivist
first-degree
murderers.
now,
compare
with
this
conduct,
the
conduct
here
at
issue,
theft
of
three
golf
clubs
with
a
sticker
price
totaling
$1,197.00.
now,
we
like
the
majority
recognize
the
constitution
does
permit
california
to
adopt
a
new
stricter
sentencing
system
and
that
is
what
it
has
done
with
the
three-strikes
law,
but
after
looking
as
we
do
in
the
opinion
in
some
detail
at
that
law,
we
can
find
no
administrative
consideration
or
other
considerations
that
could
justify
the
sentence
given
here
for
this
type
of
crime.
for
these
and
other
reasons
set
forth
in
our
opinion,
we
would
find
the
sentence
grossly
disproportionate
and
hold
it
unconstitutional.
