justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
denvir,
you
conceded
a
moment
ago
that
the
prior
offenses
can
be
considered
for
purposes
of
treating
this
offense
as
an
aggravated
offense,
given
the
prior
record;
and
yet
when
you
answer...
you've
done
this
more
than
once...
when
you
have
answered
the
question
of
going
to
disproportionality,
you
have
said,
"it's
25
to
life
for
stealing
three
golf
clubs.
"
i
don't
think
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
either
your
argument
is
it's
25...
the
appropriate
comparison
is...
or
the
appropriate
characterization
is
"25
to
life
for
three
golf
clubs.
"
in
which
case
you,
in
effect,
are
telling
us,
"ignore
the
priors;
they
don't
aggravate.
"
or
you've
got
to
say,
"it's
25
to
life
for
stealing
three
golf
clubs
when
you
have
a
prior
record.
"
--whatever
it
was,
nine
prior
offenses,
including
four
felonies,
in
this
case.
which
is
it?
because
i
assume
it
may
well
affect
the
result.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
when
you
said
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
it
inconsistent
with
your
position...
when
you
say,
"the
focus
must
be
on
this
offense.
"
is
it
inconsistent
with
that
to
say,
"this
offense...
is
stealing
three
golf
clubs
worth
$1200
by
somebody
with
a
prior
record
of
nine
offenses?
"
is
that
consistent
with
putting
the
focus
on
this
offense,
in
the
terms
that
you're
using?
justice
david
h.
souter
a
hundred
prior
instances
of
stealing
three
golf
clubs
would
not
affect
the
analysis
then
on
your
view?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i've
just...
i've
just
given
you
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
a
hundred
prior...
three
golf
clubs
every
time,
a
hundred
times...
would
that
justify
the
treatment
that
he
has
gotten?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
if
we...
if
we've
got
our
crazy
example
of
a
hundred
priors
exactly
like
this,
and
we
follow
your
verbal
criterion
at
least
of
focusing
on
this
event
as
aggravated,
would
this
be
disproportionate,
grossly?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
we
were
trying--
justice
david
h.
souter
--maybe
we
were
trying
to
have
it
both
ways
verbally
because
we
were
imprecise.
but
with
respect,
i
think
that's
what
you're
trying
to
do.
because
on
the
one
hand,
you
concede,
yes,
it
may
regarded
as
an
aggravated
offense
in
light
of
the
priors,
and
then
in
the
next
breath
you
say,
"but
the
focus
has
got
to
be
on
this
offense.
"
justice
david
h.
souter
even
with
the
hundred
prior
instances?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
adopt
justice
scalia's
analysis?
i
mean,
this
came
up
in
the
briefs,
and
this
was
an
interesting
point.
does
the
state,
for
purposes
of
proportionality
analysis,
have
the
option
to
adopt
a
different
theory
of
penalty?
and
he's
given
an
example.
do
you...
do
you
adopt
that
argument
here?
and
do
you
think
that
is
a
justification
that
you
want
to
rely
on
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
here's
the
problem
that
i
have
with
that,
and
this
is...
this
is...
this
is
what
i
wish
you
would
address.
if
we
allow,
for
purposes
of
proportionality
or
gross
disproportionality
analysis,
this
kind
of...
the
consideration
of
varying
intentions...
retribution,
incapacitation,
deterrence,
and
so
on...
and
every
time
the
state
gets
to
a
very
high
offense,
the
state
says,
"oh,
we've
changed
the
theory.
"
"we've
gone
from
deterrence
to
retribution.
"
it
seems
to
me
that
it
makes
this
kind
of
analysis
of
comparables...
this
proportionality
analysis...
impossible
because
we
no
longer
have
two
comparable
entities
on
either
side
of
our
comparison.
what
we
have
is
a
low
sentence
on
the
one
hand
for
deterrence,
and
a
high
sentence
for
incapacitation
or
retribution.
we
have
apples
and
oranges
instead
of
oranges
and
oranges.
so
my
question
is,
if
we
accept
the
state's
option
to
say,
"we've
changed
the
theory",
don't
we
read
comparability
analysis
right
out
of
the
law?
doesn't
it
simply
become
logically
impossible?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
my
problem
is,
i
don't
know
what
we're
supposed
to...
what
we
can
compare
for
comparable
examples
on
proportionality
analysis
if
it
can
be
fundamentally
affected
by
the
state's
change
of
intention
from
one
theory
in
one
crime,
or
one
set
of
penalties,
to
another
theory
in
another
set
of
penalties.
i
don't
see
what
we
can
compare.
we
no
longer
have
comparables.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
maybe...
maybe,
and
i...
we've...
we
haven't
said
this...
maybe
our
assumption
is
that
the
state,
in
establishing
a
penal
system,
is
going
to
establish
it
on
a
set
of
consistent
and
neutral
principles
from
beginning
to
end.
would
that
be
a
legitimate
basis
for
us
to
ground
our
constitutional
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
effect,
you're...
going
back
to
the
beginning
of
your
argument,
i
think
you're...
i
think
you're
saying
that
what
the
judge
here
did
in
rejecting
the
request
to
downgrade
or
to
disregard,
in
effect,
was
saying,
"yes,
i
am
finding
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
it
is
appropriate
to
sentence
on
an
entirely
different
theory,
a
theory
of
putting
them
away,
as
opposed
to
a
theory
of
deterrence.
"
and
i...
that
seems
to
be
the
logic
of
what's
going
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question
on
that?
because
again,
you
started
toward
it
in
responding
to
me
at
the
beginning.
like
you,
i
came
in
here
assuming
that
the
state
could
change
its
theories.
if
that
is
so,
then
i
guess
what
that
means
for
proportionate
or
gross
disproportionality
analysis
is
this:
a
state
can
do
it
and
can
pass
our
eight
amendment
test
if
it
has
a
reasonable
basis
for
saying,
"we
are
going,
under
certain
circumstances,
to
say
there
is
a
change
to
theory
of
sentencing.
"
"the
theory
changes
from
deterrence
or
mere
retribution
to
a
theory
or
public
protection,
putting
away
the
person
who
simply
will
repeat
and
repeat
and
repeat.
"
so,
for
purposes
of
our
proportionality
analysis,
the
question
would
come
down,
do
they
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
doing
that
under
their
statute,
in
general?
and
in
particular,
is
there
a
reasonable
basis
for
saying
that
this
is
a
case
for
that?
and
if
the
answers
to
those
two
questions
are
yes,
then
it
passes
the
test.
is
that...
would
you
adopt
that
analysis?
