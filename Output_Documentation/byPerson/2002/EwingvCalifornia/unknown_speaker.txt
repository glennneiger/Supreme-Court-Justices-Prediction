unknown
speaker
what
was
the
value
of
the
golf
clubs?
unknown
speaker
was
it
armed
robbery?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
fair
to
add
that
another
reason
for
the
sentence
was
that
the
judge
did
not
disregard
the
priors,
and
that
was
because
the
judge
had
the
record
in
front
of
him
and
the
record
showed
other...
a
history
of
other
offenses?
would
that
be
a
fair
statement?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
those
surely
are
not
misdemeanors.
unknown
speaker
oh,
other
than--
unknown
speaker
--other
than
the
burglaries.
unknown
speaker
now--
unknown
speaker
--it
actually
went
back
to
1984,
didn't
it,
with
grand
theft
in
'84,
grand
theft
in
'88?
unknown
speaker
the--
unknown
speaker
well,
solem
stands
with
rummel
and
with
harmelin.
they're
really
three
different
points,
and
solem
is
probably
the
case
that
favors
you
most.
but
certainly
rummel
is
good
law,
and
harmelin
is
good
law.
and
i
think
those
cases
don't
favor
you.
unknown
speaker
--well,
when
we're
examining
the
constitutionality
of
the
three-strikes
law,
as
applied
to
this
sentence,
we
should
take
into
account,
should
we
not,
the
purposes
of
the
california
law,
which
was
to
have
a
law
which
was...
gave
simple,
clear
notice
of
the
three-strikes
policy?
and
if
you
want
us
to
take
case-by-case,
then
that
whole
policy
is
undercut,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
i
was
going
to
ask
you
about
that,
because
you
had
said
that
the
principal
focus
has
to
be
on
this
sentence.
i'm
just
not
sure
what
your
authority
for
that
is
when
we
have
a
recidivist
scheme
of
this
kind.
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
not
sure
how
that
works.
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
with
recidivism
as
a
factor
in
analyzing
this
sentence?
unknown
speaker
give
it
some
weight,
but
not
controlling
weight,
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
why--
unknown
speaker
--why
can't
the
state
say
that...
where
a
person
has
a
string
of
convictions
like
this
man
has,
that
it's
time
to
get
him
off
the
street,
as
justice
scalia
says,
that
he
simply
cannot
conform
to
the
law?
unknown
speaker
what--
unknown
speaker
--what--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what's
the
reason
for
saying
that
though...
that
you
can
only...
that
the
focus
remains
on
this
crime,
but
others
are
relevant?
i
mean,
that
really
is
kind
of
meaningless,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
would
be
enough?
thirty
years?
would
you
like
30
years
for
walking
off
with
three
golf
clubs?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
you're
going
to
look
on
it
as
just
stealing
three
golf
clubs,
and
cast
a
blind
eye
to
his
long
record
of
criminal
activity,
i
don't
know
why
you
can
give
him
any
more
than,
you
know,
a
couple
of
years.
unknown
speaker
but
we
said--
unknown
speaker
--we
said
in
rummel,
there's
always
going
to
be
some
state
that
punishes
more
harshly
than
others.
and
certainly
it
was
not
intimated
that
that
state,
therefore,
would...
it
was
cruel
and
unusual.
unknown
speaker
well,
just
help
us
one
more
time.
the
prior
history
is
relevant,
but
then
how
relevant?
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
principal
focus
has
to
be
on
the
three
golf
clubs,
like
we're
some
judges
out
of
victor
hugo
or
something
and
that's
all
we
have
to
focus
on.
but
this...
there's
a...
there's
a
long
recidivism
component
here,
and
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
california
law
that
you're
asking
us
to
ignore,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
is
reasonable
to
say
if
he
commits
another
felony...
he's
committed,
you
know,
three
already
and
nine
other
convictions...
"one
more
felony",
california
tells
him,
"and
you
go
away
for
life.
"
why
isn't
that
reasonable?
and
this...
and
this
was
a
felony.
unknown
speaker
but
is
a
felony
under
california
law.
unknown
speaker
why--
unknown
speaker
--why
can't
california
decide
that
enough
is
enough,
that
someone
with
a
long
string
like
this
simply
deserves
to
be
put
away?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i'd
be
with
you
there,
if
it
was
a
misdemeanor
or,
you
know,
some...
but
this
is
a
felony
under
california
law.
unknown
speaker
harmelin
came
later.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
if
it's
unusual
unless
i
know
what
happened
to
other
people.
unknown
speaker
mr.
denvir,
can't
the
people
of...
this
thing,
by
the
way,
was
not
adopted
by
the
legislature,
was
it?
it
was
adopted
by
plebiscite,
of
the
people
of
california--
unknown
speaker
--by
both.
unknown
speaker
by
plebiscite.
so
the
people
of
california
decided,
"we
want
to
be
tougher".
why
do
we
have
to
be
bound
by
whatever
the
more
permissive
scheme
was
earlier?
the
people
of
california
knew
that
scheme,
and
they
decided,
"this
is
no
good.
"
"we
still
have
too
much
crime.
"
"we're
not
punishing
people
enough,
or
we're
not
keeping
them...
keeping
them
incarcerated
long
enough.
"
why
do
we
have
to
be
bound
by
whatever
the
previous
record
was?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
the
question
before
us
is,
is
it
unreasonable
to
put
away
somebody
who
has
this
record?
unknown
speaker
what's
the--
unknown
speaker
but
we're
just
doing--
unknown
speaker
those
are
cases
where
people
might
have
gotten
reduced
time
for
good
behavior--
unknown
speaker
--none
of
which
is...
and
one
question
i
wanted
to
ask
you,
in
view
of
the
infirmities
of
mr.
ewing...
is
he
still
alive?
unknown
speaker
counselor--
unknown
speaker
--how
old
was
he
at
the
time
of
sentence?
unknown
speaker
counselor--
unknown
speaker
i
would
concede
that,
but
the--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
posit
further
that
his
score
has
not
improved.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
don't--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
think
it
would.
and
the
reason
it
wouldn't
is...
i
assume
you
would
concede...
is
that
jay-walking
does
not
hurt
other
people
the
way
100
instances
of
stealing
golf
clubs
worth
$1200
hurts
other
people.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know,
and--
unknown
speaker
--and
may
lead
to
something
beyond
property
crime.
isn't
grand
larceny
much
more
likely
to
result
in
physical
confrontation
and--
unknown
speaker
--physical
injury
than
jay-walking?
unknown
speaker
which
is
why
it's
a
felony.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
serious
crime,
in
part
because
of
that...
in
part
because
of
the
risk
of
physical
confrontation
that
he
poses.
unknown
speaker
--i'm
curious
about
one
thing.
was
he
really
a
very
tall
man,
or
were
these
irons
rather
than
wood?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
good
thing
that
walking
is
not
an
essential
part
of
golf,
because
otherwise
walking
with
those--
unknown
speaker
--golf
clubs
in
his
pants
would
have
been
very
difficult.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
he
took
a
golf
cart
out
to
the
car.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
de
nicola,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
he
shouldn't
hold
you
to
it,
since
you
don't
have
the
burden
of
persuasion
here,
do
you?
i
thought
you're
defending
a...
a
decision
below.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
limit
for
being...
what
is
dividing
line
between
grand
theft
and
petty
theft
in
california?
unknown
speaker
when
i
went
to
law
school,
it
was
$100,
except
if
it
was
citrus
that
you
stole,
it
was
$50.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
things
that
puzzles
me
about
the
statute...
maybe
you
can
enlighten
me...
i
thought
that
if
there
were
two
priors
that
were
violent
but
not
related
to
property,
such
as
murder
and
rape,
that
the
third
related
to
property
wouldn't
trigger
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
even
if
you...
if
you
had,
say,
a
murder
conviction
and
a
rape
conviction
and
then
you
committed
a
wobbler
that
was
a
property
crime?
would
the
statute
treat
that
as
a
third
strike?
unknown
speaker
regardless
of
the
character
of
the
first
two
strikes.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
so...
and
there's
no
requirement
that
it
be
related
to
property.
i
misunderstood.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
i
think
some
of
our
constitutional
jurisprudence
makes
it...
makes...
turns
upon
the
distinction
between
felonies
and
misdemeanors,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
just
on
the
theory
that
justice
scalia
has
explained...
where
this
guy
is
just
too
dangerous,
we
just
don't
want
him
on
the
street
anymore,
so
we'll
put
him
in
jail
for
life,
25
years
without
possibility
of
parole.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
the
conclusion
that
justice
souter's
questions
would
lead
to
is
that
a
state
cannot
use
any
factor
except
retribution.
or
if
it
uses
any
other
factor,
it
does
so
at
the
risk
of
our
simply
holding
it
to
be
disproportionate.
unknown
speaker
and
i
don't
know
that
our...
i'm
sure
that
our
cases
don't
support
that.
unknown
speaker
now,
if
that
isn't
grossly
disproportionate,
why
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
would
be
essentially
to--
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
could
you
argue
that,
because
discretion
is
consistent
with
the
goals
of
the
statute
before
the
sentencing,
that
some
discretion
is
also
permitted
to
a
reviewing
court
after
the
sentencing,
and
they
can
still
maintain
the
symmetry
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
no,
i...
has...
has
a
trial
judge
ever
been
set
aside
for
imposing
the
third
strike?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think--
unknown
speaker
--there
are
any--
