but
we
have
given...
we've
said,
at
least,
here,
that
we
are
going
to
give
great
latitude
to
state
legislatures
in
determining
how
many
years
to
give,
and
how
to
categorize
an
offense.
why
don't...
why
don't
we
look
to
the
harmelin
case
for
the
standards,
rather
than
solem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
will
announce
first
the
opinion
in
ewing
versus
california,
no.
01-6978.
the
case
comes
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
california’s
second
appellate
district.
california’s
three-strikes
law
was
designed
to
protect
the
public
safety
by
ensuring
longer
prison
terms
and
greater
punishment
for
repeat
felony
offenders.
under
the
three-strikes
law,
defendant
who
is
convicted
of
a
felony
and
has
previously
been
convicted
of
two
or
more
serious
or
violent
felonies
must
receive
a
sentence
of
at
least
twenty-five
years
to
life
in
prison.
while
on
parole
from
a
nine-year
prison
term,
the
petitioner
stole
three
golf
clubs
worth
nearly
$400
a
piece
from
a
pro
shop,
a
california
jury
convicted
petitioner
of
felony
grand
theft.
the
prosecutor
alleged
and
the
trial
court
found
the
petitioner
had
been
convicted
previously
of
four
serious
or
violent
felonies.
in
sentencing
petitioner
to
twenty
five
years
to
life,
the
trial
court
declined
to
exercise
its
discretion
either
to
reduce
petitioner’s
felony
conviction
to
a
misdemeanor
or
to
dismiss
the
allegations
of
some
or
all
of
his
prior
convictions.
the
california
court
of
appeal
affirmed
concluding
the
petitioner’s
sentence
did
not
violate
the
eight
amendment’s
prohibition
on
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
the
supreme
court
of
california
denied
review.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
the
california
court
of
appeals'
decision.
in
enacting
the
three-strikes
law,
the
california
legislature
made
a
deliberate
policy
choice
that
individuals
who
have
repeatedly
engaged
in
serious
or
violent
criminal
behavior
and
whose
conduct
has
not
been
deterred
by
more
conventional
approaches
to
punishment
must
be
isolated
from
society
in
order
to
protect
the
public
safety.
though,
three-strikes
laws
may
be
relatively
new,
we
have
a
long-standing
tradition
of
deferring
to
state
legislatures
in
making
and
implementing
these
kinds
of
important
policy
decisions.
the
constitution
does
not
mandate
the
adoption
of
any
one
penalogical
theory
and
nothing
in
the
eight
amendment
prohibits
california
from
deciding
to
incapacitate
repeat
offenders
like
petitioner
who
have
already
been
convicted
of
at
least
one
serious
or
violent
felony.
we
have
long
recognized
recidivism
as
a
legitimate
basis
for
punishment
and
it
is
a
serious
public
safety
concern
in
california
and
across
the
nation.
any
criticism
of
the
law
should
be
directed
at
the
legislature
which
is
primarily
responsible
for
making
the
policy
choices
that
underlie
any
criminal
sentencing
scheme.
petitioner’s
sentence
is
long
but
so
is
his
criminal
history.
he
has
served
nine
separate
prison
terms
and
committed
most
of
crimes
while
on
probation
or
parole.
his
prior
strikes
were
serious
felonies
including
robbery
and
residential
burglary.
in
weighing
the
gravity
of
his
current
offence,
we
must
also
place
on
the
scales
petitioner’s
long
record
of
recidivism.
though
long,
petitioner’s
sentence
reflects
a
rational
legislative
judgment
that
is
entitled
a
deference.
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
each
have
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
souter,
ginsburg,
and
breyer
have
joined;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter,
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
