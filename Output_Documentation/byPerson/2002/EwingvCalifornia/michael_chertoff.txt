mr.
michael
chertoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
last
series
of
questions
which
justice
souter
posed
to
mr.
de
nicola
really
framed
the
issue
in
light
of
this
case's
most
recent
pronouncement
in
harmelin...
this
court's
most
recent
pronouncement
in
harmelin.
i
would
have
read
harmelin
as
establishing
two
principles,
at
a
minimum.
one
is,
the
analysis
is
not
proportionality;
it's
gross
disproportionality,
an
extremely
rare
basis
to
invalidate
a
statute.
second,
we
recognize
that
the
states
are
entitled
to
adopt
different
penological
theories,
or
a
mix
of
theories.
in
fact,
i
would
have
thought
that
a
state's
entitled
to
say,
for
example,
that
certain
types
of
crimes
ought
to
be
addressed
in
terms
of
retribution;
other
types
of
crimes
posing
other
kinds
of
issues
can
be
dealt
with
in
terms
of
deterrence
and
incapacitation.
and
if
the
consequence
of
that
principle
is
that
this
court
has
very
limited
review
on
comparability
of
sentences,
at
least
where
we
are
dealing
with
sentences
that
allow
for
the
possibility
of
parole,
then
i
think
the
conclusion
is
that
it
is
the
extremely
rare
case
in
which
a
sentence
gets--
mr.
michael
chertoff
--well--
mr.
michael
chertoff
--it's
not
for
several
reasons,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
although
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
speak
to
what
the
pre-1977
proportions
were
in
terms
of
sentencing,
we
do
know,
for
example,
that
elsewhere
in
the
country
there
have
been
comparable
sentences.
we've
cited
in
the
united
states--
mr.
michael
chertoff
--actually,
i
think
in
footnote
13,
we've
cited
several
cases
in
other
states
where
you
have
very
comparable
punishments,
where
you
have
larcenies
between
4
and
$700
as
the
third
strike--
mr.
michael
chertoff
--we
cited
review
and
rejection
of
disproportionality
challenges
in
one
case
in
nevada
to
a
life
sentence
without
parole
for
a
grand
larceny
of--
mr.
michael
chertoff
--$476,
and
a
similar
one,
i
think,
in
south
dakota.
also,
of
course,
as
we
look
at
the
current
sentencing
regime,
this
is
not,
as
in
solem
versus
helm,
where
you
have
single
judge
who
is
apparently
an
outlier
under
the
state
sentencing
scheme.
in
this
case,
if
one
takes,
in
fact,
a
petitioner's
own
figures,
you
have
at
least
2
to
300
individuals
whose
third
strike,
under
the
california
scheme
as
it
now
exists,
has,
in
fact,
been
a
property-based
crime.
and
i
think
the
most
compelling
reason
why
this
is
not
that
very,
very
rare
case
where
we
strike
down
a
sentence
is
precisely
what
justice
ginsburg
has
been
repeatedly
asking
about,
the
discretion
that
the
courts
have
to
tailor
the
particular
sentence
in
this
case
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
if
we
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
sentencing
judge
carefully
considered
the
entirety
of
the
file
with
respect
to
the
trigger...
or
the
predicate
offenses,
which
involved,
actually,
three
burglaries
in
the
course
of
a
single
month,
one
of
which
involved
pulling
a
knife
and
threatening
somebody,
as
well
as
at
least
nine
prior
offenses.
and
interestingly,
in
no
case
since
1988
had
the
petitioner
ever
successfully
completed
probation
or
parole.
he
was
always
violating
probation
or
parole
by
committing
his
next
offense.
and
that's
precisely
what
the
sentencing
judge
looked
at
and
explicitly
referred
to
in
rejecting
the
request
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
either
to
downgrade
the
triggering
offense
to
a
misdemeanor,
or
to
eliminate
some
of
the
strikes.
and
i
would
have
thought
that
is
precisely
what
we
expect
and
want
judges
to
do
in
a
rational
sentencing
system.
mr.
michael
chertoff
that's
correct;
an
entirely
different
theory,
though,
that
is
embraced
by
the
state
in
passing
this
law.
mr.
michael
chertoff
i
would
absolutely
agree
that
if
it
satisfies
those
two,
it
passes
the
test.
that's
not
to
say
that
if
it
flunks
those,
it
automatically
fails
the
test.
but
certainly
if
you
meet
those
conditions,
i
think
you
pass
the
test.
and
i
think
there's
a
common
sense
to
that.
one
could
look,
for
example,
at
certain
types
of
violent
crimes,
like
murders
and
rapes
and
say,
irrespective
of
whether
it
was
a
crime
of
passion
or
something
that
will
never
happen
again,
"it
is
so
heinous,
our
philosophy
is
we
have
to
punish
it.
"
but
one
can
also
look
at
comparatively
small
crimes,
at
least
if
they're
felonies,
and
say,
"if
someone
is
repetitiously
unable
to
conform
their
conduct
to
the
requirements
of
the
law,
we
don't
have
to
wait
until
he
commits
the
next
felony
or
the
next
two
felonies
before
we
put
an
end
to
it.
"
and
interestingly,
if
one
goes
back
blackstone,
who
talks
a
little
bit
about
the
issue
of
proportionality
as
it
related
back
in
his
day,
he
discusses
the
fact
that
when
you
deal
with
habitual
offenders,
it
would
be
cruel
to
the
public
to
simply
allow
that
person
to
get
out
again
and
commit
their
next
crime.
so,
i
don't
know
that
it's
so
much
that
the
state
changes
its
theory,
as
that
the
state
adapts
its
theory
to
the
particular
type
of
crime
and
particular
type
of
offender.
and
that's,
of
course,
what
we
want
to
have
in
sentencing.
and,
finally,
i
would
say
this.
in
a
scheme
like
california,
where
the
state
judge
has
the
power
to
tailor
to
the
particular
offender
and
the
particular
offense
what
the
right
answer
is,
for
the
federal
courts
to
come
in
under
gross
disproportionality
analysis
and
recalibrate
that...
even
if,
sitting
as
state
trial
judges,
the
justices
might
feel
we
would
do
it
differently...
would
be
essentially
converting
the
courts
into
a
constitutional
sentencing
commission.
and
if
one
looks
at
the
companion
case--
mr.
michael
chertoff
--convert
the
court
into
a
constitutional
sentencing
commission.
doing
the
kind
of
analysis
that
we
now
have,
a
sentencing
commission--
mr.
michael
chertoff
--it
would
be
a...
certainly
very
complicated
thing,
justice
breyer.
so...
and
if
one
looks
at
the
companion
case,
andrade,
and
the
subsequent
cases
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
have
flowed
from
that
case,
one
sees
this
phenomenon
beginning
to
emerge,
where
every
fact
pattern
is
evaluated
slightly
differently.
one
court
views
burglary
as
being
a
violent
offense;
one
court
says
it's
not
a
violent
offense.
mr.
michael
chertoff
the
state
law
could
certainly
provide
for
some
kind
of
review
as
a
matter
of
state
sentencing
law
in
terms
of
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
sentencing
judge.
mr.
michael
chertoff
i
know
of
cases
where
they
have
affirmed
trial
judges
that
have
set
aside
strikes.
i
don't
know
of
a
case--
mr.
michael
chertoff
--i'm
not
aware
of
it.
mr.
michael
chertoff
i'm
not
aware--
mr.
michael
chertoff
--of
such
a
case.
certainly
the
state
law
could
allow
that
to
happen.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
return
the
rest
of
my
time
to
the
court.
