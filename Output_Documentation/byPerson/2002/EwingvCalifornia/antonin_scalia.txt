how
many...
how
many
convictions
in
all,
felonies
plus
misdemeanors?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
purpose
of
the
three-strikes
law,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
take
off
of
the
streets
that
very
small
proportion
of
people
who
commit
an
enormously
high
proportion
of
crimes.
i
forget
what
the
statistics
are,
but
it's
something
like,
you
know,
of
those
convicted,
20
percent
commit
85
percent
of
the
crimes.
it
sounds
to
me
like
your
client
is
a
very
good
candidate
for
that
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
that's
a
reasonable
law.
it
seems
to
me
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
person
you
want
to
get
off
the
streets.
he's
obviously
going
to
do
it
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
have
thought
that
your
response
to
justice
souter
would
have
been
that
it
might
seem
disproportionate
insofar
as
the
penal
goal
of
punishment
or
retribution
is
concerned,
but
it
depends
on
what
you
want
your
penal
goals
to
be.
california
has
decided
that
disabling
the
criminal
is
the
most
important
thing,
and
in...
from
that
point
of
view,
it's
not
necessarily
disproportionate.
the
one
is
disabled
as
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
proportionality...
you
necessarily
have
to
look
upon
what
the
principal
objective
of
the
punishment
is.
if
the
objective
of...
if
the
objective
is
retribution,
then,
sure,
i
guess
it's
disproportionate
to
execute
somebody
for
killing
only
one
person,
when
you
do
no
more
than
execute
somebody
for
killing
20
people.
but
if
your
purpose
is
disabling
the
criminal,
i'm
not
sure
that
it...
that
the
example
that
justice
souter
gave
is
disproportionate.
