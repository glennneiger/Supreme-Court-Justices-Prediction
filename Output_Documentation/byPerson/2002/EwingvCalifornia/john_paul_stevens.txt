justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
theory
of
the
limits
of
the
constitutional
protection
here?
supposing
the
offense
was
speeding...
and
it
can
be
dangerous
speeding...
and
you
had
a...
you
said
that...
15
arrests
for
speeding
gives
you
this
very
sentence
we
got
in
this
case.
would
that
be
permissible,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
possibly
be
constitutional
or
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
wouldn't
it
clearly
be
constitutional
if
we're
thinking
about
protecting
the
public
from
repetitive
offenders?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
statute
would
have
been
unconstitutional
if
they
had
said
it's
a
misdemeanor
when
it's
$1200...
if
the
legislature
just,
say,
called
the
three
golf
clubs
for
$1200
by
a
misdemeanor
instead
of
by
felony,
would
that
change
the
constitutional
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
serious
or
violent...
it
really
doesn't
have
to
be
violent;
it
has
to
serious.
but
you
could
have
had
$1200
thefts,
four
or
five
of
them,
and
he
would
still
qualify,
wouldn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
there
not
serious
crimes
that
are
not
violent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they're...
i'm
just
trying
to...
i'm
trying
to
understand
the
theory.
is
violence
an
absolute
requirement,
in
your
view,
in
one
of
the
priors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
so
then
we
could
have
something
equivalent...
maybe
instead
of
$1200,
$2000
or
something.
but
if
you
just
had
five...
or
three
or
four
$2,000
burglaries,
that...
do
you...
would
that
be
permissible
to
put
him
in
jail
on
the
same
sentence
that
you
have
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
25
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
your
view,
violence
is
really
more
significant
than
the
number
of
prior
offenses,
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you...
but
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
your
view
would
be
if
there
were
no
violence,
but
just
seven
or
eight
high-speed
offenses,
say,
speeding,
or
$1200
golf
clubs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
speeding
is
dangerous.
people
get
hurt
in
automobile
accidents.
it
seems
to
me
it's
exactly
the
same
risk
to
the
public
that
you
have
with
this
kind
of
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
depends
on
what
the
legislature
calls
the
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
this...
in
california,
does
the
appellate
court
ever
set
aside
sentences
on
the
ground
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
invoke
the
three
strikes
law?
