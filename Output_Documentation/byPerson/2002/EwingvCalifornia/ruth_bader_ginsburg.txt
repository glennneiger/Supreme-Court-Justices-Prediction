that
was
the
ohio
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
one
that
was
alleged
to
be
a
felony,
i
think,
in
the
government's
brief--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
think
that
it
was
only
a
misdemeanor.
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
denvir,
would
you
clarify
whether
your
challenge
is
strictly
as
applied?
because
some
of
the...
some
of
the
points
that
you
make
seem
to
be
going
to
the
statute
wholesale.
so,
for
example,
you
talk
about
it...
the
statute's
infirm,
because
it
has
no
washout
for
aging
offenses,
but
there
was
no
such
offense
at
stake
here.
the
strikes
were
all
rather
recent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
we...
so
we
should
leave
out
things
like
no
washout,
that
someone
who
never
served
any
time
would
subject
to
the
three
strikes--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
how
do
you
decide--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
much
is
too
much?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
statistics
that
you
were
quoting,
though,
those
were
not
three-strikes
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
de
nicola,
there's
a
lot
of
discretion
built
into
this
scheme.
it
comes
across
as
three
strikes
and
you're
out,
and
that's
it;
but
it's
not.
there's
discretion
in
the
prosecutor
and
discretion
in
the
judge.
are
there,
in
los
angeles
or
in
california,
any
guides
to
prosecutors
in
exercising
their
discretion,
say,
whether
to
treat
a
wobbler
as
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
prosecutor
can
charge
something
as
a
misdemeanor.
as
far
as
the
striking
a
strike
is
concerned,
is
that
solely
for
the
judge?
or,
i
suppose,
it
depends
on
what's
charged.
the
prosecutor
can
decide
not
to
charge
two
strikes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
similarly,
to
reduce
a
wobbler
to
a
misdemeanor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
might
it
be
an
abuse
of
the
judge's
discretion
not
to
reduce
such
a...
if
it's
a
wobbler,
in
such
a
case,
or
not
to
strike
a
strike?
