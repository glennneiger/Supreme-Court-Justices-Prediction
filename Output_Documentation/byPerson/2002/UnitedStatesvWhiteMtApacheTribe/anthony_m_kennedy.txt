justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if...
can
we
talk
just
for
a
moment
about
the
analogy?
and
we'll
call
it
just
that,
the
area
of
private
trusts.
i...
i
take
it
that
usually
a
trustee,
who
has
the
obligation
to
repair
buildings
for
the
beneficiaries
so
they
don't
fall
into
disrepair,
does
so
at
the
beneficiaries'
expense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that...
that
didn't
seem
to
figure
into
your
argument.
again,
it...
it
struck
me,
as...
reading
the
briefs...
that
that
was
an
argument...
you
don't
really
make
that
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
because
the
trustee
here
is
both
the
beneficiary...
is...
is
a
co-beneficiary
of
the
trust?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
would
have
seemed
to
me,
following
justice
scalia's
question
and
my
own,
that
if
the
law
of
trusts
gave
a
clear
indication
one
way
or
the
other
that
there
was
a
liability,
then
the
tucker
act
analysis
might...
might
be
different
accordingly.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
the
government
could
have
just
destroyed
the
property
or
the
structures
on
the
land?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
put
it
another
way.
do
you
think
they
had
a
duty
not
to
destroy
the
property?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i
understand.
but
part
of
the
question
we
have
is
to
what
extent
did
the
government
assume
duties
beyond
immunizing
the
property
from
state
taxation
and
preventing
its
alienation.
did
they
have
any
additional
duties?
and
i'm
not
clear
on
whether
you've
told
me
they
had
a
duty
not
to
destroy
it
or
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
did
they...
from
any
source,
did
they
have
a
duty
not
to
destroy
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you'd
help
me
if
you
responded
yes
or
no,
to
be
honest
with
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
would...
how
would
you
describe
the
duties
the
united
states
has
as
trustee
with
relation
to
this
property?
how
would
you
describe
the
sum
total
of
its
duties?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
just...
just
to
put
justice
souter's
question
back
before
you...
and
my
own:
what
trust
duties
does
the
united
states
have
in
addition
to
not
alienating
the
property,
and
making
sure
that
it's
immune
from
state
taxation?
i
think
your
answer
is
it
has
no
fiduciary
obligations
at
all.
there
may
be
some
obligations
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
protect
property,
et
cetera,
but
as
a
trustee,
it
has
no
fiduciary
obligations
other
than
the
ones
that
are
mentioned.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
do
those
general
obligations
with
reference
to
this
property
import
any
duty
other
than
the
duty
not
to
alienate
and
to
ensure
that
it's
immune
from
state
taxation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
want
to
make
i
understand
your
argument.
if
the
government
had,
after
this
statute
was
enacted,
said,
you
know,
we
really
don't
have
any
interest
at
all
in
these
buildings,
and
just
let
them
go
to
waste,
but
they
didn't
use
them
in
any
way,
there
would
be
no
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
does
that...
does
that
extend
to
a
requirement
that
the
united
states
spend
its
monies
rather
than
the
tribe's
monies
to
preserve
the
land?
suppose
in
this
case
that
some
basic
erosion
systems
were
needed
because
the
land
was
eroding,
endangering
the...
the
topography,
and
some
simple
irrigation
rivulets
or...
or
drainage
rivulets
would...
would
save
the
property.
would
the
united
states
have
the
obligation
to
perform
those...
those
repairs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
its
expense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
authority
do
you
have
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's...
that's
certainly
not
a...
a
trustee
doesn't
have
the
duty
to
repair
at
his
own
expense
in...
in
a
private
trust.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
if
your--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
your
answer
to
me--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
based
on
your
answer
you
gave
to
me
about
the
hypothetical
about
the
erosion
occurring,
it...
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
the
united
states
has
an
affirmative
duty
in
that
case,
the
fact
that
it
occupied
or
didn't
occupy
the
buildings
does
not
alter
its
duty
to
keep
those
buildings
in
repair.
its
occupancy
and
use
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
in
my
hypothetical
they
didn't
occupy
or
use
the
land.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
brauchli--
--what
about--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
don't
want
them.
and
you
said,
well,
you
know,
it's...
it's
going
to
cost
us
a
lot
of
money
to
keep
up
these
buildings.
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
for
that.
we
can't
do
that.
could
the
government
then
say,
well,
we
have
a
stand-off,
we'll
destroy
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
after
the
1960
act
was
enacted
and
they
had
become
the
trustee.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can...
can
the
government
terminate
this
trust
anytime
it
wants?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
the
government
terminate
this
trust
anytime
it
wants
by
executive
order?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's...
that's
what
i
thought.
the
trust
remains
in
effect
at
all
times.
