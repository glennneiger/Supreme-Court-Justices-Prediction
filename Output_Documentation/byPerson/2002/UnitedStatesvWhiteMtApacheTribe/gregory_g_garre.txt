mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1960,
congress
declared
the
former
fort
apache
military
post
to
be
held
in
trust
for
the
white
mountain
apache
tribe.
the
specific--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
it...
it's
certainly
much
older
today.
it's
about
40
years
older
today.
the
condition
the...
the
legislative
history
doesn't
discuss
the
condition
of
the
fort
in
particular
detail.
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
military
fort
was
built
for
temporary
use...
today,
some...
almost
a
century
ago,
and
in
1960
had
been
built
for
temporary
use,
you
know,
more
than
50,
60,
or
70
years
ago.
so
it
wouldn't
at
all
have
been
surprising
if
there
had
been
a
state
of
decay
in
1960.
and
of
course,
when
congress
passed
the
1960
statute,
there
was
no
indication
at
all...
certainly
not
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
or
in
the
legislative
history
that's
contained
in
respondent's
lodging...
that
it
had
in
mind
a
historic
preservation
goal,
or
that
it
had
in
mind
that...
that
it
would
require
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
undertake
the
enormous
financial
responsibility
of
having
to
restore
a
century-old
fort.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
absolutely,
justice
o'connor.
the...
the
vast
majority
of
the
buildings
and
historic
district
area
of
fort
apache
are
used
today
for
school
and
administrative
purposes.
the
bureau
of--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--they
are.
as
we
point
out
in
note
1
of
our
reply
brief,
the
department
of
the
interior
has
spent
more
than
$3
million
over
the
past
decade
or
15
years
on
repair
and
maintenance
projects
at
the
fort.
it's
also
true
that
the
tribe
itself
has
engaged
in
historic
restoration
efforts
at
the
fort
with
the
support
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
the
department
of
the
interior,
and
with
the
assistance
of
private,
state,
and
even...
in
some
cases...
federal
tax
dollars.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
true.
just
like
the
u.s.
government--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
when
congress
places
land
in
trust
for
indians,
it
has
two
well-settled
meanings
that
this
court
has
recognized.
first,
it
places
a
restraint
on
the
alienation
of
property,
and
second,
it
immunizes
the
property
from
state
taxation.
and
if
you
look
at
pages
6
and
7
of
the
respondent's
lodging,
that
indicates
that
in
1958,
when
there
was
discussion
about
what
to
do
with
fort
apache,
the
tribe
itself
encouraged
the
department
to
have
congress
place
the
land
in
trust
so
that
it
was
in
a
nontaxable
status
like
the
surrounding
reservation
lands.
now,
we
know
from
the
first
mitchell
decision
decided
by
this
court
that
simply
placing
property
in
trust
does
not
in
itself
create
a
substantive
right
to
money
damages.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
justice
ginsburg,
that...
that
may
be
true
in
the
factual
sense,
but
the
1960
act...
that
is,
that
the
federal
government
is
using
the
property,
but
the
1960
act...
quite
unlike
the
general
allotment
act...
specifically
reserves
to
the
government
the
right
to
use
the
property
for
government
uses.
and
in
that
respect,
we
think
the
trust
relationship
created
by
the
statute
in
this
case
is
much
more
limited
than
the
one
that
was
created
by
the
statute
in
mitchell
i,
and
the
existence
of
factual
federal
control
cannot
in
itself
give
rise
to
a
damages
action
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i...
i
think
generally,
the
"administrative
use"
can
refer
to
executive
uses,
and
is
a
very
broad
term.
in
that
respect,
i
think
it's
instructive
that
congress
used
that
term.
nevertheless,
i
think
that...
that
"administrative
purposes"
has
to
be
read
with
school
purposes,
and
can
be
read
to
refer
to
both
uses
for
storage
and
the
like,
and
also
for
administrative
purposes
used
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
undertake
activities
at
fort
apache
or...
or
on
the
surrounding
reservation.
so
in
that
respect,
it's
administrative
for
the
purpose
of
the
department
of
the
interior,
who
operates
activities
there
through
the
local
agent
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
now--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--oh,
well,
our
position
would
be
that
the
vast
majority,
if
not
all,
was...
well,
that's
not
true.
the...
the
vast
majority
of
the
property
has
been
within
the
government's
control,
but
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
remands
for
building-by-building,
in
a
sense,
trial
on
the
existence
of
federal
use
and
control.
and
the
tribe
does
have
access
to
the
fort
apache
property.
the
tribe
is
there.
the
tribe
even
has
a...
a
cultural
museum
that
it
operates
on
the
property.
so
it's...
it's
not
as
though
this
is
a
federal
enclave--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
you
look
at
appendix
a
to
the
tribe's
complaint,
which...
which
has
a
detailed
building-by-building
analysis
of
the
ways
in
which
the
building
don't
meet
certain
requirements,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
the
tribe's
damages
claim
extends
to
all
the
buildings
at
fort
apache
and
that,
therefore,
it
may
extend
to
buildings
over
which
the
federal
government
is
not...
have
any
active
use
or...
or
control.
but
we
don't
think
that
a
damages
action
can
be
brought
against
the
united
states
based
on
some
fact-bound,
manipulable
notion
of
federal
control.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
under
the
tucker
act...
and
this
court
emphasized
it
in
the
mitchell
decisions,
and
it's
emphasized
it
in
other
decisions...
a
substantive
right
to
damages
against
the
united
states...
which,
after
all,
is
a
right
to
damages
against
the
public
fisc...
has
to
be
grounded
in
a
source
of
substantive
law.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that...
that's
true.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that
is
true
and
it's
much
unlike
the
typical
common
law
trust,
but
the...
the
most
fundamental
reason,
justice
kennedy,
is
we
don't
think
that
a
court
should
have
to
plumb
through
the
common
law
to
determine
whether
or
not
congress
established
a
right
to
damages
against
the
united
states
in
this
case.
and
it's
also
true...
if
you
look
at
the
common
law,
the
first
thing
you...
you're
met
with...
with...
is
with
the
general
rule
that
you
can't
get
breach
of
trust
damages
against
the
sovereign.
so
you'd
have
to
get...
not
only
you'd
have
to
get
around
the
courts--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
and
i
agree,
justice
scalia,
and
we
think
that
that
question
should
be
answered
by
looking
to
the
act
of
congress
on
which
the
tribe
relies,
which
is
the
1960
act.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
with
respect,
i
disagree.
and
i
think
the
mitchell
i
case
establishes
that.
in
mitchell
i,
both
the
court
of
claims
and
the
dissenters
on
this
court
reasoned
that
because
the
general
allotment
act
placed
land,
quote,
in
trust,
that
therefore
one
could
look
to
the
common
law
and
therefore
one
could
import
into
the
tucker
act
all
the
liabilities
that
would
follow
against
a
private
trustee,
even
liabilities
that
would
result
in
damages
actions.
a
majority
of
this
court
rejected
that
analysis.
now,
in
mitchell
ii,
the
court
specifically
affirmed
the
result
in
mitchell
i,
and
it
emphasized
that
mitchell
ii
was
different
because
in
that
case,
the
court
had
statutes
and
regulations
that
created
specific
management
duties
that
could
be
fairly
interpreted
as
mandating
the
payment
of
compensation
for
the
breach
of
those
duties.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
at
page
18a
of
the
petition
appendix...
and
the...
even
the
tribe
recognizes
on
page
11
of
its
brief...
that
the
1960
act
doesn't
set
forth
any
specific
management
duties
on
the
part
of
the
government.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i...
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
the
notion
that
the
government
would
destroy
the
property,
if
it
did
so
in
a
way
that
was
clearly
inconsistent
with
the
terms
of
the
act--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that...
that
duty,
if
it
exists,
comes
from
ordinary
tort
principles
and
from
principles
of
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment.
and
those
claims
haven't
been
asserted
in
this
case.
this
case
involves
a
breach
of
trust
action,
a
claim
for
damages
based
on
the
alleged
breach
of
trust
which
the
tribe
grounds
in
the
1960
act,
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--not
under...
under
the
1960
act,
the
statute
in
this
case.
now,
if
the
government
had--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i...
i
think...
i
think
it
would,
justice
stevens.
if
i
could
respond
by...
by
maybe
running
through
some
hypotheticals--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes,
it
would
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
if
congress
sold
the
fort
to
someone
else,
or
if
congress
destroyed
the
fort.
then
the
tribe
might
have
a
claim
for
just
compensation.
the
tribe
has
referred
to
some
just
compensation
cases
in
its
brief,
but
it
hasn't
brought
a
just
compensation
claim
in
this
case.
the
tribe
also
might
seek
to
bring
a
damages
action
under
the
federal
torts
claimed
act...
tort
claims
act
for
some
kind
of
destruction
of
property.
the
tribe
hasn't
brought
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
it's...
it's
not
clear
to
me
the
context
in
which
that
question
came
up.
but
i
also
think
that
it's
true
that
if
the
secretary
decided
that
it
was
necessary
to
level
a
building
because
it
proves
an
attractive
nuisance
to
school
children,
or
because
it
was
desirable
to
build
a
more...
newer
and
better
educational
facility
at
the
fort,
that
the
1960
act
would
authorize
the
secretary
to
do
that.
but...
but
we
do
recognize
that
there
are
other
principles
in
this
area
stemming
from
the
fifth
amendment,
a
source
of
substantive
law,
stemming
possibly
from
the
federal
torts
claims
act,
another
source
of
substantive
law,
which
aren't
invoked
in
this
case,
which
might
be
implicated
based
on
the
government's
management
of
the
property.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
in
mitchell
ii,
justice
o'connor,
the
statutes
and
regulations
there,
which...
which
the
court
described
as
a
pervasive,
statutory
scheme
governing
indian
timber
management,
provided
specific
fiduciary
management
duties
that
could
be
fairly
interpreted
as...
as
mandating
payment
of
compensation.
they...
they
specifically
govern
the
generation
of
profits
or
proceeds
for
the
indian
tribe,
and
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
violation
of
those
duties,
grounded
in
a
statute
or
regulation,
gave
rise
to
a
money
damages
action
under
the
tucker
act.
this
case
is--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
the...
the
principal
duties
are
the
ones
that
the
court
has
always
recognized
when
it
places
land
in
trust:
not
to
alienate
the
land
and...
and
it
immunizes
it
from
state
taxation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
correct
when
the
tribe
comes
into
court
under
the
tucker
act
and
asserts
a
claim
for
monetary
damages
against
the
united
states
treasury.
we're
dealing
against
an
area
of
sovereign
immunity
where
the
united
states
is
immune
from
damages
for
breach
of
trust
unless
congress--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--not
enforceable
in
an
action
for
monetary
damages.
of
course,
in
this
area,
the
court
has
recognized--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it's
conceivable
that
there
would
be
an
equitable
remedy
based
on
a
violation
of
statute,
not
on
equitable
duties.
this
is...
this
is
a
realm--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes.
sorry.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
in
that
situation,
justice
souter,
the
tribe
might
be
able
to
bring
an
injunction...
injunctive
action
perhaps
under
the
apa
claiming
that
that
use
of
the
property,
the
destruction
of
it,
would
exceed
the
scope
of
the
government's
use
right
under
the
1960
act.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that...
that
would
be
under
statute,
not
on
some--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
it
could
be
a
property
interest
as
well.
i
mean,
we
acknowledge
that
the
1968...
the
1960
act
gives
this
tribe--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to.
the
court
has
had
many
cases
brought
by
indian
tribes
claiming
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment
of...
of
property,
which...
at
least
in
some
management...
some
aspects
would
have
a
trust
in
it.
overlapping
all
this
area
is
the
notion
that
the
government
has
political
and
moral
responsibility
to
the
indian
tribes,
and
the
court
has
recognized
that
throughout
its
decisions
since--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
united
states
has
general
fiduciary
obligations
to
the
indian
tribes
that
this
court
has
recognized.
but
the
court
has
never
recognized...
and
i
think
it
rejected
the
notion
in
the
mitchell
i
case
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--not
a
duty
and
certainly
not
a
duty
that's
enforceable
in
an
action
for
monetary
damages.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
o'connor,
that
duty
certainly
is
not
expressed
in
the
terms
of
the
1960
statute,
and...
and,
of
course,
there
are
other
statutory--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i...
i
don't
think
that
that
position
would
be
consistent
with
the
court's
ruling
in
mitchell
i,
where
the
court
rejected
the
notion
that
the
use
of
language,
in
trust,
subjects
the
united
states
to
all
the
liabilities
of
a
private
trustee.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
with
respect,
i
think
that
there...
there's
less,
justice
o'connor,
that...
that
congress
specifically
carved
out
of
the
trust
relationship
the
right
of
the
government
to
use
the
property
for
the
government's
purposes.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but...
but
there's
a
key
difference,
justice
ginsburg,
between
this
case
and
mitchell
ii
with
respect
to
the
question
of
control.
in
mitchell
ii,
the
court
emphasized
throughout
its
decision
and...
and
discussed
the
statutes
and
regulations
in
detail
for
more
than
four
pages.
the
control
stemmed
from
specific
statutory
and
regulatory
duties
that
were
created
by
congress
in
that
case,
and
the
court
found
that
the
violation
of
those
specific
duties,
which
could
be
fairly...
fairly
interpreted
as
mandating
compensation,
gave
rise
to
a
damages
claim
against
the
united
states.
in
this
case,
the
tribe
can't
point
to
a
single
statute
or
regulation,
and
the
only
statute
it
relies
in
this
case...
in
this
court
is
the
1960
act
that
creates
any--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
there...
there
is
no
specific
management
duty
in
this
case.
instead
of
the
situation
in
mitchell
i
or
mitchell
ii,
congress
gave--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it...
it
might,
justice
stevens,
but
i
think
the
reference
to
that
also
is
important
in
terms
of
congress'
express
delegation
to
the
secretary
the
duty
to
use
all
of
the
trust
property,
the
land
and
the
buildings,
to
operate
an
indian
school
there,
which
is
the...
the
use
that...
that
the
property
had
been
put
since
the
1920s.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it...
it
certainly
would
be
a
much--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--different
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i...
i
think...
if
i
can
analyze
that
claim.
i...
i
think
they...
they
might
have
a
claim,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
no,
justice
breyer,
and
if
i
could
explain
why.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--congress
creates
a
number
of
duties.
and
congress
has
legislative...
of
course,
in
the
area
of
historic
preservation,
and
it
creates
duties
that
the
courts
below
found
are
procedural
in
nature.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
then
the
statute...
they
would...
they
would
have
a
specific
management
duty.
and
then
the
question--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i...
i
think
they
might
under
that
situation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but
there's
a
second
question
under
the
court's
cases
that
the
court
would
have
to
answer
it,
and
that's
case
two,
and
that's
whether
or
not
that
specific
statutory
duty
can
be
fairly
interpreted
as
mandating
the
payment
of
compensation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
of...
of
course,
in
that
situation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
of
course,
in
that
situation--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
think
it's
the
question
because
the
word
control
doesn't
appear
anywhere
in
the
face
of
the
statute.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes.
and...
and
i
think...
and
if
i
could
be
more
clear,
i
think
that
we
think
the
court's
cases
and
the
tucker
act...
and...
and
we
think
can
also
look
to
cases
in
the
section
1983
context...
establishes
a
two-step
inquiry.
first,
has
congress
created
a
specific
duty
on
the
government's
part,
and
second,
can
that
duty
be
fairly
interpreted
as
mandating
a
payment
of
compensation
breached?
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
conceivably
you
might
have
a
tort
claim,
justice
breyer,
but
that's
not
a
claim
that's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--possibly
as
a
breach
of
a
contract
or
a
tort--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--violation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
the
court
refused
to
do
that
in
the
mitchell
i
case
because
there,
the
court
used
the
language,
in
trust,
and
it
refused
to--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
what
the...
i
mean,
there
you
might
have
a
situation
where
the
question
is
whether
you
could
enforce
obligations
against
a
private
individual
who
left
it
in
trust.
here
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--you
could
impose...
you
could--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
the
restatement
provisions--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that
we
referred
to
incorporate
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
in
this
area,
and
you
could
impose
possibly
injunctive--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i...
i
think
it's
both,
justice
scalia,
that
the
public
trust
is
different
in
that
we
don't
ordinarily
assume
that
the
government
acts
in
all
its
capacities
as
a
private
trustee.
and
that's
certainly
true
in
the
indian
law
context.
this
court...
there
are
more
than
56
million
acres
of
land
that
the
government
holds
in
trust.
if
the
court
assumed
just
by
congress'
use
of
the
word
in
trust,
the
government
had
assumed
all
the
liabilities
of...
of
a
common
law
trustee,
then
that
would
be
an
enormous
potential
liability
that
there's
no
indication
whatsoever
congress
ever
agreed
to
assume.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
under
the
tucker
act...
and,
of
course,
the
tucker
act
doesn't
refer
to
claims
for
breach
of
trust.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes.
that...
that's
true,
justice
souter.
but
i...
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--those
words
had
great
effect
here.
they
had
the
same
effect
that
the
words
have...
this
court
has
recognized...
with
respect
to
the
alienation
of
land
and
with
respect
to
immunization
of
land
to
state
taxation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
those...
those--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
with
respect,
i
would
disagree.
it
has
those
two
settled
consequences.
we
know
from
pages
6
and
7--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the...
that...
that
line
of
argument
is
the
argument
that
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeal...
the
court
of
claims
made
in
mitchell
i
and
that
the
dissenters
made
in
mitchell
i,
and
we
think
that
the
majority
of
the
court
rejected--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
the
factual
sense.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no,
no,
justice
souter.
that's
not
the
implication
of
our
argument.
they
do
have
the
accepted
meanings.
the
united
states
holds
land
in
trust.
it
is
immunized
from
state
taxation.
if
the
tribe
itself
held
it
or
private
indians
held
it,
it
wouldn't
be
subject...
it
would
be
subject
to
state
taxation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
it
does
in
this
case,
and
that's
the
significance
of
holding
it
in
trust.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that...
that...
it
also
has...
in
this
case
it
has
the
effect
of
making
the
lands
here
like
the
surrounding
reservation
lands.
and...
and
again,
i
think
pages
6
and
7
of
the
tribe's
lodging
helps
to
make
that
point.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
is
not
using
the
property,
and
is
not
required
to
use
the
property
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe
as
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
at
page
14a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
it's
using
the
property
for
its
own
government
purposes,
and
in
that
respect,
this
case
is
completely
unlike
mitchell
ii,
where
the
statutes
and
regulations
specifically
required
the
government
to
manage
the
property
as
an
economic
resource
for
the
indians.
there
are
no
trust
assets
to
pay
for
any
historic
restoration
efforts
because
congress
directed
that
the
property
would
be
used
for
government
purposes,
not
for
any...
any
kind
of
economic
purposes
that
would
generate
assets.
congress
has
a
separate
regime
for
historic
preservation.
it
grants
millions
of
dollars
each
year
for
historic
preservation
projects,
and
as
mr.
brauchli
alluded,
congress
has
granted
funds
for
historic
reservation
at
fort
apache.
the
tribe
has
engaged
in
its
own
historic
preservation
efforts
there
with
millions
of
dollars
of
private,
state,
and
federal
funding,
and
the
department
of
the
interior
has
put
millions
of
dollars
of
its
own
maintenance
and
repair
efforts
into
the
fort.
thank
you
very
much.
