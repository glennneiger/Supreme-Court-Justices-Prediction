justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
your...
in
your
opinion,
if
this
statute
had
added
the
words,
and
if
the
government
does
take
control,
it
shall
use
ordinary
prudence
and
skill
to
preserve
the
property,
then
they'd
have
a
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
yes
or
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
yes
or
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
say
might,
i'm
just
imagining
the
same
statute,
everything
that's
gone
on
this
morning,
and
it
says
if
they
take
control,
they
shall
use
ordinary
skill
and
prudence
to
preserve
the
property.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
then
is
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
be
no
even
then.
then
what
have
we
been
arguing
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because,
i
mean,
everybody
has
been
asking
you
whether
that
can
be
implied
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
my
impression
was
you
said
yes.
i
mean,
if
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
so
if
they
said,
and
by
the
way,
if
in
fact
they
take
control,
the
trustee...
i.e.,
the
united
states...
has
a
duty
when
they
take
control
to
use
ordinary
skill
and
prudence
to
preserve
the
property.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
the
answer
is
then
they
would
have...
they
could...
then
they'd
win.
right?
if
it
said
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
adds,
and
indeed
if
they
violate
this,
they
have
to
pay
a
lot
of
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
we're
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
our
issue
here...
what
i'm
getting
at
is
our
issue
then
is
whether
that
word
control
implies
those
latter
words--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
were,
in
fact,
left
out.
that's
the
question.
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
i...
i
was
reading...
it's
subject
to
the
right
of
the
secretary
of
interior
to
use
any
part
of
the
land
in
improvements.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i...
we
have
to
decide
right
to
use...
does
that
imply
those
words
that
are
left
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
didn't
say
he
had
to
use
it,
did
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
misspoke.
i'm
sorry
to
have
mixed
people
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
meant
right
to
use.
does
it
imply
the
words
that
are
not
there
when
they
use
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
work
in
other
areas
of
real
estate
law,
where
suppose
i
turn
my
beach
house
over
to
a
friend
and
he
has
a
wild
party
and
destroys
it?
do
i
have
a
claim
against
him
if
i
had
no
knowledge
he
would
do
such
a
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
normally
is
it
the
case
when
you
give
or
lease
or
give
property
to
other
people
if
they
wreck
the
place,
contrary
to
expectation,
we
imply
into
those
promises
or
words
that
they
had
to
take
reasonable
care?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
normally
do
that
in
the
law,
why
would
we
not
do
the
same
thing
here
where,
indeed,
in
addition
to
what
you
normally
have,
you
have
this
word
trust
and
special
relationship?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
if
it
were,
i
guess
the
real
analogy
would
be
it
goes
to
the
city
of
falls
church
to
be
held
in
trust
for
the
public
to
be
used
as
a
school
for
as
long
as
they
want
it,
and
thereafter
to
go
to
the
archeological
society
for
preservation.
and
now
they
run
it
down
as
a
school,
and
the
question
would
be
can
the
archeological
society
now
sue
them
for
the
loss.
i
don't
know.
maybe
it
can.
well,
this...
this
doesn't
say
that
it
goes
to
the
archeological
society--
--it
goes
to
the
tribe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
don't
even
know
of
one
that
says
i
have
my
forest
which
i
leave
to
the
people
of
falls
church,
and
lo
and
behold,
20
years
later,
that
forest
is
a
wreck.
they
cut
every
tree.
and
i
don't
know
if
the
citizens
of
falls
church
can
sue
there
either,
but
i
know
the
indians
can.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you...
you
rent...
it's
rather
interesting.
i
mean,
suppose...
suppose
that
the
trustee...
this
were
an
ordinary
trust,
but
the
trustee
was
giving
it
to
a
third
party
to
use,
which
he'd
have
the
right
to
do
under
the
trust.
and
the
third
party
didn't
repair
the
basketball-sized
holes
in
the
pavilion.
how
do
we
decide
if
it's
that
third
party's
responsibility,
or
if
trust
assets
should
have
been
used?
i
mean,
here
i'm
thinking
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
trustee
is
both
the
trustee
and
the
third
party
himself
because
he's
using
it
for
his
own
purposes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
the
tenant
have
to
repair
the
holes
in
the
roof?
