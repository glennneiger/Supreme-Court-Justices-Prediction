justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
garre,
is...
is
any
of
the...
or
let
me
ask
you
an
open-ended
question.
how
much
of
the
property
which
is
the
subject
of
this
claim
was
within
the
government's
control
throughout
this
period,
and
how
much
of
it
was
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
the
tribe
making...
is
the
tribe
making
a
monetary
claim
with
respect
to
property
which
it
has
had
in
its
control,
as
distinct
from
the
government's,
during
this
period?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i...
i
realize
that.
i
realize
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
in...
in
effect,
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
there
are
no
trust
duties.
there's
a
peculiarity
here.
the
word
trust
in...
as
you're
using
it
in
the
argument,
simply
has
those
two
implications:
don't
give
it
away
and
place
it
in
a...
in
a
condition
or...
or,
by
virtue
of
the
word
trust,
it
is
in
a
condition
to
avoid
taxation.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
you're
saying
that
there
are
no
fiduciary
duties
beyond
that.
if
there
is
any
duty
beyond
that,
it's
got
to
come
from
the
constitution,
or
it's
got
to
come
from
a
specific
provision
of...
of
a
statute
creating
a
duty
not
necessarily
as...
as
that
of
a
trustee,
but
simply
as
a
statutory
duty.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
you're
saying
two
things,
and
they...
they
mesh
perfectly.
one,
you're
making
a
sovereign
immunity
argument.
two,
you're
saying
there
is
no
trust
responsibility
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
the
trustee
except
not
to
alienate.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
are
conceding
that
there...
that
there
might
be
equitable
remedies
based
on...
on
a
theory
of
fiduciary
duty?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
if...
may...
may
i
just,
you
know--
justice
david
h.
souter
--pursue
the
example
that
justice
stevens
used?
if
the
government
said,
30
days
from
now,
we
are
going
to
blow
up
all
the
buildings,
there
would
be
a...
an...
an
equitable
remedy
based
upon
fiduciary
duty?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
that...
i...
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
you're
saying
that
would
not
be
based
on
fiduciary
responsibility?
justice
david
h.
souter
if...
if
it
exceeded
the
government's
use
right,
what...
what
other
obligation...
what
would
be
the
source
of...
of
a...
of
an
obligation
if...
if
it
was
not
fiduciary
duty?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
property
interest
takes
into
consideration
the
trust
relationship,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
mr.
garre.
you're...
you're
arguing
that
you
can't
infer
from
the
use
of
the
word
trust
that
all
of
the
obligations
and
all
of
the
potential
liabilities
of
a
private
trustee
are
carried
by
it.
but
your
argument
seems
to
go,
if
i
understand
it,
to
the
other
extreme,
that
the
use
of
the
word
trust
seems
to
imply
no
obligation
and
no
responsibility
unless
it
is
followed
by
a
specific
delineation
of
what
those
responsibilities
are.
and
my
question
is...
justice
breyer
a
minute
ago
was
saying,
well,
what
would
be
different
if
we
added
certain
words.
and
my
question
is
what
would
we...
be
different
if
we
subtracted
certain
words
on
your
theory?
what
if
the
statute
had
not
included
the
words,
in
trust?
wouldn't
your
argument
be
exactly
the
same?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
would
you
answer
my
question?
wouldn't
you
be...
aren't
you
making
the
same
argument
under
a
statute
that
says
in
trust
that
you
would
be
making
under
a
statute
that
did
not
include
the
words,
in
trust,
at
all?
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
you...
what...
what
are
we
to
do
with
the
usual
canon
of
construction
that
we
assume
that
congress
does
not
use
useless
words?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
they...
they
couldn't
alienate
under
a
statute
that
says
the...
the
land
and
et
cetera
will
be
held
by
the
united
states
for
the
tribe.
taxes
couldn't
be
levied
by
lesser
sovereigns
against
lands
held
by
the
united
states
under
those
circumstances.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to
me
that
the
word,
in
trust,
means
nothing.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
would
you
not
have
those
consequences
without
those
words?
it's
true
if
you
have
those
words,
the
consequences
follow.
but
wouldn't
the
consequences
follow
without
the
words?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
in
fact
that's
all
the
government...
if
that's
all
congress
was
getting
at,
why
didn't
congress
simply
say
that
instead
of
using
the
phrase,
in
trust,
that
normally
carries
enormous
implications?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
justice
ginsburg
has
suggested
that
maybe
the...
the
significance
of
that
line
of
argument
depends
on
whether
there
was
or
was
not
control.
but
i
think--
justice
david
h.
souter
--on
your
argument,
i
think
what
you're
telling
us
is
that
mitchell
i...
and
in
any
event
your
argument...
has
the
implication
that
those
words
add
absolutely
nothing.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the
government
of
the
united
states
held
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
and
it...
and
it
would
do
so
under
the
statute
if
the
words,
in
trust,
weren't
used.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
they
cut--
justice
david
h.
souter
--could
they
cut
down
some
trees
and
say,
we're
going
to
sell
off
some
timber
because
we've
got
to
raise
some
money
to
fix
the
roof?
would
that
have
been
a...
a
legitimate
use
of
the
property?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
literally
got
to
come
out
of
a
pocket
of
the
national
government
which
has
no
relation
to
the
tribe's
assets
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
your
argument
that
they...
i...
i'm
not
saying
whether
you
win
or
lose
on
it,
but
isn't
your
argument
that
they
are
obliged
to
give
us
the
money
to
repair
them
because
the
deterioration
took
place
when
they
were
in
control?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
your
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it...
let...
may
i
also
get
clear
on
something
that
i...
i
thought
i
was
clear
on
but
i'm
not.
is
it
your
theory
that
they
are
responsible
for
the
waste
or
damage
or
deterioration
that
took
place
up
to
the
point
at
which
they
ceased
actively
to
use
it,
or
up
to
the
point
at
which
they
relinquished
control
over
it
to
you?
because
i
take
it
those...
for
some
buildings...
will
be
different...
different
dates.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
what
is
your
theory?
is
it
that
their
responsibility
is
measured
by
the
date
at
which
they
ceased
to
use,
or
the
date
at
which
they
relinquished
control
to
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
during
part
of
the
period
in
which
the...
the
property
was
just
boarded
up,
their
responsibility
was
still
in
effect.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
a
1960
statute
declared
that
the
former
fort
apache
military
reservation
was
held
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
white
mountain
apache
tribe
subject
to
the
right
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
use
any
part
of
the
land
in
improvements.
the
secretary
has
exercised
this
right
with
respect
to
about
30
of
the
post
buildings
and
appurtenances.
in
1993,
the
tribe
commissioned
in
assessment
of
the
property
resulting
in
a
finding
that
it
was
in
need
of
rehabilitation
expected
to
cost
about
$14
million.
this
is
the
amount
that
tribe
sought
when
it
subsequently
sued
the
united
states
citing
the
terms
of
the
1960
act
and
alleging
that
the
united
states
had
breached
its
fiduciary
duty
to
maintain,
protect,
repair,
and
preserve
the
trust
property.
in
response,
the
government
acknowledge
that
the
under
the
indian
tucker
act,
it
was
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
federal
claims
with
respect
to
certain
tribal
claims.
but
the
government
stressed
that
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
operated
only
when
underlying
substantive
law
could
be
fairly
be
read
as
giving
rise
to
a
particular
duty
breach
of
which
should
be
compensable
in
money
damages.
here
the
government
argued,
no
statute
or
regulation
not
even
the
1960
act
could
fairly
be
read
to
impose
a
legal
obligation
to
maintain
the
property,
let
alone
authorized
compensation
for
breach.
the
court
of
federal
claims
agreed
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
the
federal
circuit
reversed
and
remanded
on
the
understanding
that
in
light
of
the
1960
act,
the
government’s
use
of
the
property
triggered
a
common-law
trustee’s
duty
to
act
reasonably
to
preserve
the
property.
an
obligation
fairly
interpreted
as
supporting
a
money
damages
claim.
we
now
affirm.
as
the
government
has
argued,
and
as
justice
ginsburg
explained
a
moment
ago,
the
indian
tucker
act
gives
the
court
of
federal
claims
lurisdiction
over
tribal
claims
but
it
creates
no
substantiate
right
enforceable
against
the
government
by
way
of
a
claim
from
money
damages.
the
statute
creates
a
right
capable
of
supporting
such
a
claim
only
if
it
can
fairly
be
interpreted
as
mandating
compensation
by
the
government
for
damage
sustained.
the
act
at
issue
in
this
case
does
permit
a
fair
inference
that
the
government
is
subject
to
duties
as
a
trustee
and
potential
liability
and
damages
for
breach.
the
statute
expressly
defines
fiduciary
relationship
in
providing
that
fort
apache
be
held
by
the
government
in
trust
for
the
tribe,
and
it
invest
the
united
states
with
discretionary
authority
to
use
portions
of
the
trust
corpus.
under
the
terms
of
this
provision,
the
united
states
has
enjoyed
daily
occupation
of
the
trust
corpus
and
so
has
obtained
controlled
over
the
property.
although
the
1960
act
does
not
expressly
subject
the
government
to
conservation
duties,
the
fact
that
the
property
occupied
by
the
united
states
is
expressly
subject
to
a
trust
supports
a
fair
inference
that
an
obligation
to
preserve
the
property
improvements
was
incumbent
on
the
government
as
trustee.
the
court
of
federal
claims
does
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
the
government
should
be
liable
in
damages
for
breach.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia,
and
justice
kennedy
join.
