but
there
was
an
enormous
difference
in
that
case
in
that
the
indians
managed
the
land.
under
the
general
allotments
act,
the
idea
was
to
make
the
individual
owner
autonomous.
here,
i
think
it's
not
disputed
that
this
land
has
been
operated
by
the
u.s.
government,
and
the
u.s.
government
has
exclusive
control.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
just
explain
one
small
point
to...
to
me?
i
know
what
"school
purpose"
means.
what
is
"administrative"?
is
that
administrative
in
connection
with
the
school,
or
some
free-floating
administration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
are...
to
this
extent,
you're
differing
from
counsel's
position
before
the
federal
circuit,
because
i
believe
at
that
level,
counsel
was
asked
if
the
united
states
could
dynamite
all
the
buildings
to
the
ground
with
no
liability
to
the
tribe,
and
the
answer
was
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre,
there...
there
is
one
significant
difference,
and
that
is
the
control
element.
mitchell
i
stressed
that
the
control
was
with
the
allottee.
mitchell
ii
has
a
whole
paragraph
that
says
what's
key
is
who
has
control.
and
as
i
read
it,
it
was
that
these
specific
instructions
were
an
indication
that
the
u.s.
had
exclusive
control,
but
that
the
real
thing
was
the
control,
who
has
control
of
this
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
you're...
you're
reading
it
differently
than
i
have
just
set
it
out.
as
i
take
the
court
to
have
said
control
is
key,
and
these
specific
regulations
show
that
there
is
indeed
control,
that
the
united
states
runs
the
show.
but
the
nature
of
this
trust,
there
wouldn't
be
any
instructions.
you
wouldn't
expect
there
to
be
detailed
instructions.
the
question
is
who
was
in
control.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
they
didn't...
in
justice
kennedy's
question,
if
the
united
states
didn't
use
it
for
administrative
and
school
purposes,
then
the
united
states,
under
the
terms
of
the
trust,
has
no
right
to
hold
it
because
they
have
this
exclusive
right
of
occupancy
only
for
those
purposes.
and
if
they
just
let
the...
then
it
would
be...
wouldn't
it
belong
to
the
tribe?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
precisely
are
you
asking
for?
you
said...
you
started
to
say
something,
and
then
you
were
asked
a
question.
you
said
you're
not
asking
for
wear
and
tear.
what
is
the
measure
of
the
damages
you're--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
it
would
be...
that...
that
would
be
the...
14
million-dollar
figure
to
bring
it
up
to
code?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
still...
what
you're
talking
about
is
what
it
would
cost
to
bring
this
up
to
historic
building
preservation
level?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
of
the
government's
argument
that
this
was
really
an
illusory
trust?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
is,
the
statute,
the
1960
statute,
gave
the
government
the
right
to
use
this
for...
for
school
and
administrative
purposes
as
long
as
they
wanted
to.
so
at...
looking
at
it
from
1960,
that
could
be
forever.
they
might
have
wanted
to
use
it
as
a
school
forever,
and
then
the
tribe
would
have
nothing.
