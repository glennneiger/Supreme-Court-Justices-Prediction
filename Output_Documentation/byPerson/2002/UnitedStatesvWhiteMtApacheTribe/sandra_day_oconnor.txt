day
o'connor
what
condition
was
it
in
in
1960?
was
it
basically
like
it
is
today,
or
has
it
gotten
worse?
what
was
it
like
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--making
use
today
of
a
portion
of
the
structures
there
for
the
school
and
administrative
needs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
those
maintained
in
some
fashion
for
that
use
by
the
federal
government?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
u.s.
government
does
hold
the
property
in
trust
for
the
tribe...
the
white
mountain
tribe.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
basic
responsibility
does
that
entail,
would
you
say,
the
fact
that
the
government
is
a
trustee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
mitchell
ii?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
there
might
well
be
a
duty
for
the
trustee...
the
u.s.
government
acting
as
trustee
here...
not
to
lay
waste
to
the
property
held
in
trust
for
the
tribe--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--not
to
affirmatively
lay
waste
to
it
or...
or
allow
something
to
happen
that
just
the
ordinary
care
would
suggest
should
not
happen.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
does
say,
all
right,
this
property,
fort
apache,
is
to
be
held
by
the
u.s.
government
in
trust
for
the
tribe.
and
maybe
that
conveys
some
notion,
in
addition
to
not
alienating
it,
not
laying
waste
to
it.
now,
whether
what's
done
fits
that
i
don't
know.
maybe
ordinary
wear
and
tear
isn't
covered,
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
there's
a
little
more
here
than
was
true
in
mitchell
i.
it's
specific
property,
hold
it
in
trust,
and
the
government
can
use
it
for
a
school
or
administrative
needs,
but
there...
there's
something
more
than
was
in
mitchell
i.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
since
1960,
did
the
u.s.
use
some
of
the
buildings
other
than
it's
now
using?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
there
are
35
buildings
on
the
premises,
how
many
did
the
government
use
since
1960?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
of
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
physically
occupied
all
35?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
since
1960.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
now
it
physically
occupies
4
of
the
35.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
at
the
trustee's
own
expense.
that's
the
point.
the...
the
trust
itself
has
to
provide
the
means,
the...
the
financial
wherewithal
to
make
those
repairs.
this
isn't
a
duty
financially
imposed
on
the
trustee.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you'd
have
to
have
some
authority.
you
may
disagree,
but
how...
how
do
you
find
it
out
of
trust
law?
