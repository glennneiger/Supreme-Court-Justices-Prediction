mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
never
taken
control
of
these
buildings,
we
would
not
be
here.
it
would
be
a...
a
bare
trust.
simply
putting
these
buildings
in
trust
does
not
create
any
fiduciary
obligations.
but
the
secretary
did
take
control.
it's
not
mandatory;
it's
voluntary.
and
that's
why
this
case
is
exactly
like
mitchell
ii.
in
mitchell
i,
there's
no
nexus
between
the
general
allotment
act
and
managing
a
forest.
but
when
you
look
at
the
forest
management
statute,
there's
a
direct
nexus
from
the
forest
management
statutes
to
control
of
the
forest,
and
when
you
control
the
forest,
to
the
exclusion
of
the
tribe,
then
you
are
responsible
as
a
fiduciary.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
justice
scalia,
i
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
the...
the
benefit
to
the
tribe...
congress
stripped
the
united
states
of
all
fee
simple,
absolute
title
and
gave
100
percent
beneficial
title
to
the
tribe.
the
united
states
has
no
retention
of
ownership
whatsoever.
they
have
a
use
easement,
and
that's
all
they
have.
a
very
limited
right.
and
the
benefit
is
what
congress
said,
and
congress
said,
we're
going
to
take
this
fort,
which
we
established
to
kill
apaches
and
imprison
them,
and
we're
going
to
give
it
to
the
white
mountain
apache
tribe.
and
they
gave
it,
and
it
has
value.
it
has
35
buildings.
it
has
7,500
acres.
now
it's
only...
you
know,
we're
down.
we're
talking
about
288
acres.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
well,
it
was
to
protect
white
settlers--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--but
from
my
clients'
viewpoint,
it
was
established
to
conquer
them.
so
that's
what
i'm
here
for,
my
client.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
and
there
was
a
benefit.
and
the...
the
benefit
said...
it's
been
postponed
because
the
united
states
secretary
reserved
a
very
limited
right
to
use
it
for
a
school--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--absolutely
none.
before
march
18,
1960,
they
could
have--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--justice
kennedy,
if
i
understood
your
question,
i
thought
you
meant
before
march
18,
1960
when
they
owned
it--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--oh.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
occupying.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
yes,
that
is
true.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
the...
the
fact
is
that
they
occupied--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--they
occupied
and
physically
controlled
the
buildings.
if...
for
instance,
we
are
not
filing
a
claim
for
the
four
buildings.
there's
only
4
buildings
out
of
35
being
used
for
a
school
right
now.
the...
four.
and
so
we're
not
filing
a
claim
for
those,
and
they
just...
they
just
sprang
for
3
and
a
half
million
dollars
to
fix
those
up.
but
the
other
buildings
that
they
have
used
and
occupied
and
destroyed
and...
and
some...
they've
demolished
four...
those
are
the
buildings
that
we
have
a
claim
for.
and
we
say
we're
not
charging
you
for
trespass.
we're
not
charging
you
for
reasonable
wear
and
tear,
but--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--yes,
and
the
reason
that
they
have
fallen
off
from
use
is
because
the
enrollment
went
from
500
students
down
to
about
80.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
the
government
used
all
of
the
buildings.
they
physically
occupied
them.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
yes,
they
did,
and
they
used
them
for
storage
and
for
schools.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
yes.
and
so
it's
been
under
the
exclusive
control.
but
as--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--four
for
school
and
about
six
for
its
administrative
use.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
if...
if
the
land
is
being...
as
i
understand
the
question,
you...
you
are
leaving
this
to
falls
church
and
as
a
beneficiary--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--that
is
not
our
situation--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--i
don't
know
because--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--i
don't--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--well,
this
is
a
private
trust.
i
think
this
is
a
private
trust,
and
it's
not
a
public
trust.
but
it's--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--justice
scalia,
i
think
you're
saying
that...
you're
talking
about
a
situation
where
the
beneficiary
doesn't
do
anything
with
the
property.
if
the...
if
the...
i
think
the
analogy
would
be...
that
you're
making
is
if
the
white
mountain
apache
tribe
did
nothing
to
their
property.
then
that's
their
choice.
but
if
you
as
the
trustee
went
in
there
and
destroyed
the
property
that
you
were
going
to
give
to
the--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--beneficiary
of
falls
church,
that's
our
situation.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
and
they're
a
trustee.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
i
don't...
i
think
there's
a
different...
there's...
this
court
unanimously
last
term
in
the
klamath
case
said
that
the
fiduciary
relationship,
the
trust
relationship,
between
the
united
states
and
the
tribes
is
the
primary
cornerstone
of
indian
law.
it
was
a
unanimous
opinion.
there's
a
special
trust
relationship
between
the
indian
people
and
the
united
states
government
and
when
the
united
states--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--yes.
yes,
they
do.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
because
they--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--well,
this
is
not
a...
i...
the
united
states,
if
they
are...
the
beneficiary
is
the
tribe,
and
i
think
when
you
have
a
trustee
in
control
and
occupying,
they...
according
to
the
treatises
i
read...
read,
there's
an
absolute
obligation
to
protect
and
preserve
the
beneficiary.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
well,
i
just
disagree
with
that.
when
the
united
states
is
the
trustee--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--okay.
my
authority
is
the
mitchell
ii
which
was
a
waste
case
as
well
as
a
benefits
case
because
in
that
case,
there
was
a
requirement
to
manage
the
forest
on
a
sustained
yield
basis,
and
if--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--no,
but
they
did
appropriate
money--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--well,
i
think
that
the
trust
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
indian
tribes
is
sui
generis.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
you
cannot
import
the
common
law
wholesale
into
a...
this
type
of
situation.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
well--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--well,
the
complaint
is
for...
for
damage
to
the
infrastructure
for
failure
to
keep
up
the...
the
water
and
sewer
system,
the
electrical
system,
as
well
as
the
buildings
that
they
used
and
controlled.
they
had
total,
exclusive
control.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
it
expires
and
they...
they
said
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
below
that
the...
the
circuit
judges
said,
well,
can
you
use
it
as
a
uranium
dump?
and
the
department
of
justice
said,
no,
because
that
would
be
a
breach
of
the
trust
because
we're
only
allowed
to
use
it
for
school
or
administrative
purposes.
therefore,
a
uranium
dump
would
be
outside
the
use
allowed.
i
think
waste
is
a
use
outside
what
congress
allowed
them,
and
it's
a
specific
use
and
it
should
be
construed
against
the
easement.
the
easements
are
not
wide
open.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
well,
i
think
in
this
case
the
united
states
was
obligated
to
prevent
the
deterioration.
all
they
have
to
do
is
repair...
they
have
basketball-sized
holes
in
the
roof
letting
rain
in
which
progressively
deteriorates...
deteriorates
the
property.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
i
think
they
should
use
their
own
assets
since
they're
using
it
rent-free,
and
they
should
protect
the
property
because
they
have--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--yes,
the
united
states'
assets.
i'm...
are
you...
i'm
not--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--oh,
you
mean
the
trust
assets.
you
mean
the
buildings
themselves?
i
don't...
well,
they
have
collected
rents--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--for
some
of
the
buildings.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
of
the
tribe's
timber?
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
i
would
say
they
cannot
do
that
without
the
tribe's
permission.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
well--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--well,
under
landlord
and
tenant
law,
the
tenant
would
certainly
be
liable
for
the
waste,
and
this
court
said
that
in
the
bostwick
case.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
the
tenant
would
be
responsible.
any
lease
of
tribal
property
by
a...
a
tenant,
the...
the
duty
is
to
the
united
states
as
well
as
the
tribe.
and
the
united
states
under
the
leasing
regulations
has
an
absolute
duty
to
go
in
there
and
protect
the...
to
protect
the
value
of
the
property...
and
i
put
that
in
my
brief...
the
value
of
the
property
from
a
tenant
who's
injuring
that
property.
so
here
they're
saying
we're
like
a
tenant,
but
we
can
commit
all
the
waste
we
want
to.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
i
think
the
measure
of
damages
would
be
against
the
measuring
stick
of
a
reasonable
trustee
in
like
circumstances
in
total
control
of
the
trust
corpus
of
his
beneficiary.
and
i'm
saying
it's
that
amount
of
damages
necessary
to
bring
it
up
to
code,
less
reasonable
wear
and
tear.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
well,
that
was
been
altered
because
the
tribe
has
engaged
in
a
little
self-help,
and
we
actually
took
over
five...
five
buildings,
and
we
had
a
grant
from
the
white
house
save
america's
treasures
and
the
national
endowment
of
the
humanities
and
the
state
of
arizona,
and
the
tribe
put
2
million
of
their
own
dollars.
so
i
think
that
figure
is
more
like
$8
million,
and
that's--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--not
necessarily.
its
just
a...
when
you
have...
not...
we're
not
talking
about
restoring
it.
we're
talking
about
rehabilitating
the
buildings
and
you
can
keep
its
historic
character
and
make
modifications
to
it.
we're
not
talking
about
restoring
it
and
making
it
into
a
theme
park
like
the
government
suggests.
we're
talking
about
bringing
it
up
to
code.
you
can
make
some
modifications
to
it.
the...
the
standards
are...
the
secretary's
standard
says
if
you're
going
to
have
properties
listed
on
the
national
register
of
historic
properties,
you
can
make
modifications,
but
you
have
to
keep
the
historic
character.
you
can
upgrade
the
electricity.
you
can
repair
the
roofs.
and
actually
the
code
is
a
lot
more
lax
than
the
uniform
building
code.
the--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--well,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
usually
uses
the
general
services
administration
and
the
uniform
building
code
or
the
uniform
code
of
building
conservation.
that's
what
the
national
park
service--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--yes.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
right.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
right.
and
their
assessment,
the
bia's
assessment,
in
1998
came
out
within
a
few
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
our
assessment
of
the...
of
the
cost
to
make
the
repairs
which
they
had
deferred
maintenance
basically
for
40
years
in
some
buildings.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
no,
they
have
not.
because
of
the
deferred
maintenance,
those
buildings
are
boarded
up.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
right,
and
that's--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--no.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
let
me
clarify
something.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
the...
the
buildings...
when
the
need
expires,
their
right
to
be
there
expires.
i'm
talking
about
the...
the
boys'
dorm
now.
that's
the
basketball-sized
holes
in
the
roofs.
we
made
a
demand.
the
tribe
made
a
demand
for
the
return
of
15
buildings.
they
said,
you
no
longer
need
them.
give
those
buildings
back
to
us.
your...
your
right
to
be
there
has
expired,
but
you
give
us
the
money
for
the...
to
repair
those
because
they're
not
inhabitable.
they
used
to
be.
our
experts...
we've
spent
a
lot
of
money.
we
have
photographs
from
1960.
we
know
they
were
in
very
good
shape
in
1960.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
they
said...
oh,
they...
they
want
to
give
us
the
buildings.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
they
said,
you
can't
have
the
money.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
they
don't
own
them,
and
under
mitchell
ii,
this
court
said
that
when
the
united
states
is
in
control
of
a...
of
a
resource
of
a
tribe,
a...
a
fiduciary
relationship
is
established
in
respect
to
that
resource.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
that
is
my
point
which
i
did
not
apparently
express
very
well,
but
that
is
the
point
that--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--they
were
using
the
buildings
as
the
progressive...
it's
not
a
big
bang
theory
about
a
building
falling
down.
[laughter]
it's...
it's
a
progressive
deterioration
of
the
buildings.
and
then
when
they
felt
that...
they
just
started
to
board
them
up,
and...
and
we
said,
okay,
we'll
take...
they
said...
well,
actually,
they
wrote
a
letter,
said
they're
yours.
and
we
said,
what
do
you
mean
they're...
they're
ours?
with
an
$8
million
repair
bill
and
you
had
total
control,
and
you
feel
you
have
the
right
to
destroy
property
that
you
don't
own?
and
this
deprives
congress
of
the
benefit
that
congress
intended.
so
here's
the
executive
branch
saying,
we
don't
care
what
congress
gave
you.
we'll
make
sure
you
don't
get
anything
except
a...
a
pile
of
rubble.
and
someone
has
got
to
pay
for
that,
and
the
tribe
should
not
pay
for
that.
and
that's
the
point
of
the
damage
claim.
we
went
to
the
secretary
and
they
said...
after
a
year
of
wasting
my
time
at
the
solicitor's
office,
they
said...
finally,
the
special
assistant
to
the
secretary
said,
you're
going
to
have
to
sue
us
because
we're
not
going
to
give
you
the
money,
and
we
feel
we
have
the
right
to
destroy
this
property.
and
that's...
whether
it's
demolition
by
neglect
or,
as
the
department
of
justice
said
in
the
circuit
court
below,
since
you
don't
have
title
to
this
property,
contrary
to
the
plain
text
of
the
act,
we
have
the
right
to
dynamite
it.
and
somehow
it's
been
held
in
some
kind
of
purgatory
state
where
what
congress
intended
to
give
to
the
tribe
wasn't
really
intended
to
give
to
the
tribe.
it's
a...
it's
a
plaything
for
the
bia
to
play
with
and
destroy.
and
that's
not
the
fiduciary
relationship
that
this
court
has
been
noted
for
in...
in
respect
to
a
one-on-one
relationship.
in
nevada
versus
united
states,
we
said,
when
it's
one
on
one,
a
fiduciary
relationship
and
there's
a
fiduciary
obligation
incumbent
upon
the
united
states
when
it
deals
with
indian
people.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
it
is
different
depending
on
the
building,
and
that's
why
we
say
we
have
to
go
building-by-building.
and
they
have
raised
the
statute
of
limitations.
they
said,
your
claim
is
premature,
in...
in
the
trial
court.
then,
in
the
circuit
court
they
said,
it's...
no.
they
said
it's...
you're
too
late.
you
didn't...
the
statute
of
limitations
will
bar
your
claim.
so
that's
still
lingering
out
there.
then,
in
the...
then
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
they
said,
it's
not
in
trust,
and
therefore
we
can
dynamite
it.
then,
in
their
briefs
here
they
say,
we
control
everything
and
your
claim
is
premature.
so
they
have
shifting
defenses.
different
buildings,
because
they
didn't
maintain
them,
they
started
sloughing
off
one-by-one
because
they--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--it's...
it
goes...
it
really
does
have
to
go
by
building-by-building
because
i
would
say
that--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--in
the
last
5,
6.
the
last
6
years
have
been
progressive,
where
they
started
boarding
them
up
and
just
stopped--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--it's...
it's
some
of
each.
it's
a
deteriorating
use.
we
don't
ask
them
to
restore
pre-1960
condition.
we're
saying
take
the
1960
condition,
and
the
waste
you
committed
from
1960
when
it's
under
your
control.
we
don't
want
them
to...
they
don't
have
to
restore
it
back
to
its...
as
they
say...
old
west
shape.
we're
just
asking
it...
for
the
condition
that
when
we
got
it
from
congress,
congress
said,
here's
the
gift.
here
is
the
fort
apache,
but
we're
going
to
give
the
secretary
just
a
limited
use,
and
when
that
need
expires,
then
the
secretary
has
no
right
because
but
for
that
act,
the
secretary
can't
even
set
foot
on
that
property.
it's
trespass.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
yes.
there's...
they
maintain
that
they
relinquished
some
buildings
and
therefore
it's
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
it
was
the
date
when
they
relinquished
control
and
we
accepted
it
because
we
refused
to
accept
them
without
the
money
to
repair
them.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
and
they're--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--yes,
because
they
still
kept
them
on
their
facility
inventory
maintenance
list,
but
they
didn't
get...
they
get
the
maintenance
money
and
they
use
it
for
other
things
other
than
the--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--are
you
talking
about
after
march
18th,
or
before--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--if
they
never
physically
occupied
those
buildings
or
they
stopped
using
them,
it's
not
their
liability.
if
they
walked
away
from
the
property
in...
on
march
18th,
1960,
they
said,
hey,
congress
just
gave
this
to
you.
we've
been
using
them
but
we're
going
to
walk
away
today.
no
responsibility.
none.
because
when
they
were
the
owner,
they
can
do
whatever
they
want.
when
the
tribe
becomes
the
owner
and
they...
they
take
control
of
the
trust
corpus,
then
there's
an
obligation,
the
most
fundamental,
rudimentary,
crude
fiduciary
duty
as
to--
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
--pardon?
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
no,
it
cannot
because
the
executive
branch
does
not
have
the
power
to
terminate
this
reservation.
only
congress
can.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
but
it's...
it'd
be
only
a
bare
trust,
your...
your
honor,
because
if...
once
they...
once
they
relinquish
the
control
and
the
need
is
not
there,
their
liability
ends.
you
know,
we
have
taken
over
the
cook's
cabin.
we've
taken
over
four
buildings.
their
liability
is
going
to
end
there
because
we
took
them
over.
we
had
to
use
some
self-help.
mr.
robert
c.
brauchli
well,
the...
to
answer
that
question,
your
honor,
the
measure
of
damages
always
could
be
measured
against
a
reasonable
trustee.
if
they
kept
using
for
100
years,
then
of
course,
there's
going
to
be
normal...
you
know,
even
normal
wear
and
tear,
but
there's
still...
that's
something
for
the
trial
court
to
sort
out
as
to
the
measure
of
damages.
i
mean,
what
is
reasonable...
what
is
reasonable
to
repair,
what
is
reasonable
not
to
under
the
circumstances.
that's...
that's
a
question
for
the
trier
of
fact
as
to
the
measure
of
damages.
but,
you
know,
the
reality
of
the
situation
is
that
the
need
has
expired
except
for
about
10
buildings.
in
this...
i
mentioned
the
bostwick
case
because
in
the
bostwick
case,
the
united
states
had
open,
free
use...
unrestricted
use
of
a
private
home,
and
they...
they
committed
waste.
and
there
was...
and
this
court...
court...
they
were
sued.
the
united
states
was
sued
and
the
court
said
that
there's
an
implied
covenant
against
waste
even
those
the
lease
is
silent
as
to
that
duty.
and
i
think
the
analogy
is
here
in
the
trust
situation.
when...
when...
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
statute
doesn't
say
you
have
to
repair
buildings
when
you're
using
them.
it
would
be
unnatural
for
a
statute
to
say
so.
that's
all
i
have,
your
honor.
