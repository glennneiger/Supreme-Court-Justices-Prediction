justice
john
paul
stevens
the
court
will
hear
argument
in
united
states
against
the
white
mountain
apache
tribe.
mr.
garre.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
interrupt
with
just
one...
one
question?
the
trust
here
refers
not
only
to
the
land
but
to
the
improvements.
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
that
make
a
difference?
in
a...
in
a
private
situation
wouldn't
that
normally
create
in
the...
the
trustee
a
duty
to
ensure
against
fire,
and
to
take
care
of
the
improvements
as
opposed
to
just
bare
legal
title
to
the
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
brauchli.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
i
mean,
what...
what
kind
of
a
theory
is
that?
if...
if
the
government
occupies
the
buildings
and...
and
by
that
preserves
them
in
a
small
sense,
they're
falling
apart,
but
at
least
it's
better
than
a
complete...
complete
abandonment,
they're
liable,
but
if
they
completely
abandon
them,
they're
not.
i...
i
just
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
i
mean
after
1960.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
your
initial
argument
was
that
after
1960,
once
the
government
took
control
by,
i.e....
by
that
i
thought
you
meant
possessing
the
buildings--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
had
a
duty,
but
that
if
it
had
not
possessed
the
buildings
or
occupied
the
buildings,
it
would
have
no
duty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i...
i
just
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i'm
not
sure
you
confront
the
question,
and
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
is.
if
the
waste...
duty
to
protect
waste
requires
spending
some
money,
whose
money
do
you
spend?
the
trustee's
or
the
trust's?
the
beneficiary's
money
or
the
trustee's
money?
if
you
buy
an
insurance
policy,
does
the
trustee
pay
for
out
of
his
own
pocket
or
out
of
trust
assets?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
the
united
states
have
used
trust
assets
to
perform
that
duty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
they
should
use
it.
could
they...
in
your
judgment,
could
the
united
states
have
used
trust
assets
to
perform
that
duty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what...
what
is
this
code?
is
it
a
generally
applicable
code
about
things
like
electric
wiring
and...
and
sound
roofs,
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
is
that
what
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
that
what
you're
referring
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--when
you
say,
the
code?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
ask
this
factual
question?
i
should
know,
but
i
really
don't.
how
long
ago
did
the
government's
active
use
of
the
buildings
cease?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
a
theory
on
when
their
active
use
of
the
buildings
ceased?
justice
john
paul
stevens
give
me
any
building.
was
it
10
years
ago?
five
years
ago?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
theory
is
that
the...
the
waste
occurred
before
or
after
they
ceased
using
some...
or
some
of
each?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
in...
suppose
in
1960
the
government
said,
here
are
the
buildings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
brauchli.
mr.
garre,
you
have
1
minute
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
