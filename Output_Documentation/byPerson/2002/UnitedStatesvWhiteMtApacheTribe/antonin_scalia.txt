justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that...
but,
i
mean,
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
tucker
act.
i
mean,
to...
to
plead
sovereign
immunity
begs
the
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
exactly
the
question
before
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
in
order
to
say
he
controlled
it,
you...
you
would
have
to
say
he--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
wasn't
a
question
of
laying
waste
in
mitchell
i,
was
it?
it
was
just
a
question
of
not
using
the
land
to
its
utmost
financial
benefit.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
question
he's
asking
you
is...
is
destroying
the
land.
you
say
in
your...
you
quote
in
your
brief
austin
on
trusts
to
the
effect
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
a
private
trust
and
a
public
trust.
what...
what
kind
of
cases
is...
is
that...
is
that
section
referring
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
suppose
i
leave
my...
my
house
to
the
city
of
falls
church
in
trust
for
the
people
of
falls
church.
what...
what
obligations
are
imposed
on
the
city
of
falls
church?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
imposing...
what
obligations
are
imposed
upon
falls
church.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
leave
property
to
falls
church
in
trust
for
the
people
of
falls
church
or
in
trust
for
some
category
of
the...
of
the
people
of
falls
church.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
little
league
or
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
is
that
all
that...
that
scott
on
trusts
was
referring
to,
just
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
if
that's
all
he
was
referring
to,
you
know,
that's
been
waived
by...
by
the
statute
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
there
was
something
quite
different
he
was
referring
to,
that
the
whole
nature
of
a
public
trust
is
different
from
a
private
trust.
if
that's
not
the
case,
then
all
of
that
is
quite
irrelevant
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
control...
the
control
here
was
not
control
given
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe.
to
the
contrary,
it
was
control
given
for
the
united
states'
own
use.
it
seems
to
me
that's...
that's
quite
different.
i
agree
that
if...
if
you...
you
say
the
united
states
shall
control
it
for
the
benefit
of...
of
the
tribe,
you
might
have
a
different
case.
but
that's
not
what
this
statute
said.
it
said
the
united
states
shall
control
it
for
its...
its
use,
running
an
indian
school
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
administrative
purposes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
fort
was
to
protect
white
settlers.
but
you...
you
know,
you
can
describe
it
the
way
you
like.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
brauchli,
would
you
give
me
your
view
on
the
hypothetical
that
i
asked
your...
your
colleague
on
the
other
side?
suppose
i
leave
property
to
the
city
of
falls
church.
the
city
of
falls
church
takes
possession.
it's
not
occupied
by
anybody
else.
and
it's...
it's
in
trust
for
the
people
of
falls
church.
it
doesn't
do
anything
with
the
land.
it
just
leaves
it
there.
now,
in
the
law
of
trusts,
that...
that
would
be
wasteful,
and
the
trustee
would
have
to
use
the
land
in
order
to
generate
income
for
the
people
of
falls
church,
or
at
least
do
something
for
the
people
of
falls
church.
do
you
think
the
city
of
falls
church
would
be
in
breach
of
trust?
do
you
know
of
any
lawsuits
against
cities
or
any
public
entities
that...
that
have
accepted
land
or
other
property
in
trust?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
lot.
it's
a
great
big
lot,
and
i
say,
you
know,
i'd
like
to
leave
it
to
the
city
of
falls
church
and
i
do.
and
the
city
of
falls
church
doesn't
do
anything
with
it,
just
leaves
it
there.
it
could
have
built
a...
you
know,
an
apartment
building
and
gotten
a
lot
of
income
for
the
city
coffers.
it
could
have
built
a
baseball
diamond
or
whatever.
it
just
leaves
the
lot
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
lawsuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
crucial
to
your
case
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
goes
to
the
point
of
whether
a
public
trust
is
the
same
thing
as
a
private
trust.
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
that
it
goes
to
the
indians
afterwards.
it
just
says,
in
trust.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
destroying
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i'm
putting
destroying
it
aside.
i'm...
i'm
just
saying
that
the
city
of
falls
church
doesn't
do
anything
with
it.
it
does
not
do
what
a
trustee
would
normally
have
to
do,
and
that
is
produce
income
from
it,
or...
or
use
it
in...
in
some
way
that
will
benefit
the...
the
cestui
que
trust.
okay?
it
just
leaves
it
fallow.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
i
don't
know
of
any
lawsuits
in
which
in
such
a
situation
a
citizen
could
say,
you
know,
i'm...
i'm
a
citizen
of
falls
church,
and
you
are
wasting
my...
my
trust
estate.
justice
antonin
scalia
--waste...
waste
is
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
--waste
is
different
from
doing
something
that
costs
money,
and
the
money
has
to
come
from
somewhere.
and...
and
do
you
think
the
united
states
could
sell
off
a
piece
of
this
to
private
hands
in
order
to
obtain
the
money
to
renovate
these
buildings?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're...
you're
urging
then
that
ordinary
trust
law
does
not
apply
in
the
case
of
a
public
trust.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
brauchli--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm...
i'm
confused
about...
about
these
buildings
that...
that
have
basketball-sized
holes
in
the
roof.
the
government
is
still
using
these
buildings?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
they're
not
using
them
anymore.
so
i
mean,
you
can't
argue--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
they
have...
if
they're
not
using
them,
you
can't
say
that
they're
in
control
of
them,
and
that
their
being
in
control
requires
them
to
make
the
repairs.
i
mean,
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under...
under
the...
under
the
statute,
they're
not
required
to
use
the
buildings.
they
may
use
the
buildings.
if
they're
no
longer
using
them,
and
they
have
basketball
hole...
size...
sized
holes
in
the
roof,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
come
up
with
some
theory
other
than
the
government's
continuing
control
which
imposes
upon
the
government
the
obligation
to
repair
the
buildings.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
did
the
government
say?
you
can't
have
the
buildings,
or
you
can't
have
the
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
exactly
right,
it
seems
to
me,
if
the
only
theory
on
which
they're
obliged
to
repair
them
is
that
they're
in
control
of
them.
they're
saying,
you
know,
we're
not
using
them
anymore.
we
don't
want
to
repair
them.
if
you
want
them,
they're
yours
and
you
can
repair
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
they...
they
were
still
using
those
buildings
when
the...
when
the
basketball-sized
holes
in
the
roofs
appeared?
