justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
is
10324
which
you're
relying
on.
that
is,
the
arbitrator
shall
be
empowered
to
interrupt
and
determine
the
applicability
of.
i
mean,
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this...
this
is
a
contract
matter.
right?
i
mean,
if...
if
the
parties
clearly
didn't
want
the
arbitrator
to
do
this
and
wanted
the
court
to
do
it,
you...
you
don't
dispute
that
the
court
would
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
just
a
question
of
contract.
now,
you
concede
the
point
that
arbitrability
is
for
the
courts.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
presumably
if
10304
had
read
no
dispute,
claim,
or
controversy
shall
be
arbitrable,
okay,
under...
under
this
code
where
6
years
have
elapsed,
that
would...
would
that
exclude
this
from...
from
the
arbitrator?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
goodness,
it's
using
the
exact
term
that
you
concede
sends
it
over
to
the...
to
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
what
do
you
have
to
do
beyond
using
the...
the
very
word
that
you
say
bounces
it
to
the
court?
they
say
it.
it
shall
not
be
arbitrable.
and
even
that
will
not...
will
not
get
it
to
the
courts.
what...
what
does
one
have
to
do
to
get
it
to
the
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
my
next
question
is
going
to
be,
is
there
a
whole
lot
of
difference
between
saying
it
shall
not
be
arbitrable
and
saying,
it
shall
not
be
eligible
for
submission
to
arbitration?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
think
there
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
which
is
why
you're
fighting
me
so
hard
on
this.
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
happened
to
the
intent
of
the
parties?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you're
talking
as...
as
though
this
is
some
law
being
sent
down
from
on
high.
i
thought
we
established
that
step
one
is
what
did
the
parties
intend.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that
even
if
the
parties
say
it's
not
arbitrable,
well,
that
doesn't
matter.
we
still
go
through
this...
this
game
that
seems
to
come
down
from
on
high.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
you're
saying
arbitrability
under
our
cases
is
not
for
the
court
necessarily.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
say
arbitrability
is
for
the
courts,
then
if
the...
if
the
agreement
between
the
parties
says
this
is
not
arbitrable,
that
question
of...
of
whether
those
facts
exist
or
not
ought
to
be
for
the
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
if
i
have
an
arbitration
agreement
that
says
all...
all
disputes
arising
from
an...
an
accident
on
the
employer's
premises
shall
be
arbitrable,
and
the
issue
is
whether
this
accident
occurred
on
the
employer's
premises
or
not?
one
of
the
parties...
or
the...
the
employer
contends
that
this
injury
occurred
elsewhere
entirely.
who
decides
whether
it
occurred
on
the
premises
or
elsewhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
different
from
here?
the
parties--
justice
antonin
scalia
--did
not
agree
to
arbitrate
any
claims
that...
with...
with
regard
to
an
accident
that
did
not
occur
on
different
premises,
but
that
incurred...
occurred
more
than
6
years
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
agree
to
arbitrate
it.
they
said
it
shall
be...
shall
not
be
eligible
for
submission
to
arbitration.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
don't
see
how
that
principle
applies...
doesn't
apply
here,
but
applies
in
the
other
premises
situation.
i...
i
just
don't
see
any
distinction
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
can't
you
make
it
a...
i
mean,
it's
up
to
the
parties,
who
are
masters
of
their
agreement.
if
they
want
to
make
timeliness
part
of
the
condition
of
the
arbitration,
surely
they
can
do
it,
can't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
text
in
john
wiley
&
sons?
what
was
the
language
of
the
agreement?
did
it...
did
the
agreement
say
that
no
controversy
shall
be
eligible
for
submission
to
arbitration?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
that...
that
seems
to
me...
let
me
put...
it's
the
same
question.
let
me
put
it
to...
to
you
another
way.
is
there
any
difference
between
your
reading
of
this
clause,
shall
be...
shall
not
be
eligible
for
submission
to
arbitration,
and
the...
the
way
you
would
read
a
clause
which
said,
no
dispute,
claim,
or
controversy
which...
which
occurred
6
years
previously
shall
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
not
arbitrable...
shall
be
remediable?
no
award
shall
be
given
for
any...
for
any
occurrence
prior
to
6
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
that...
that
would
be
a
merits
question,
and
that's
what
i
think
was
at
issue
in...
you
know,
it's
a
statute
of
limitations.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
phrased
as
a
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
it
says
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--neither--
justice
antonin
scalia
--neither
does
a
clause
which
says
only...
only
events
that
occurred
on
the
employer's
premises
are
arbitrable.
that
doesn't
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
decides
that
either.
but...
but
since
it
is
an
arbitrability
question,
you...
you
assume
the
court
will
decide.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
think
they
were
going
to
arbitrate
about
any
matter
that
occurred
more
than
6
years
previously.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore,
they
didn't
think
the
arbitrator
would
be
the
one
to
decide
whether
it
occurred
6
years
previously
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
all
sorts
of
characteristics
of
a
claim:
where
it
occurred,
when
it
occurred,
the
people
between
whom
it
occurred,
and
so
forth.
you...
you've
given
us
no...
no
basis
for
distinguishing
one
of
those
characteristics
from
another
as
far
as
whether
the
court
or...
or
the
arbitrator
decides.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suggest
that
a
very
clear
basis
is
what
the
parties
themselves
have
said.
when
they
have
referred
to
a
particular
characteristic
as
being
non-arbitrable,
it
means
that
the
question
of
whether
that
issue...
whether
that...
that
fact
rendering
it
non-arbitrable
exists
is
a
question
for
the
courts.
that...
that
would
solve
a
lot
of
cases.
and
i
don't
know
how
else
you...
you...
you
distinguish
where
from
when
from
between
which
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
here
where
language
is
not
very
likely
to
reflect
their
intent,
it's...
their
language
will--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
more
likely
to
be
reflected
by
some
arbitrary
rule
that
if
it
relates
to
place,
yes;
if
it
relates
to
time,
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
before
you
do
that,
do
you
disagree
with...
what
he
said
the...
i
thought
that
your...
your...
you
would
accept
what
he
says,
but
that...
that
your
point
is
that
the
primary
conduct
causing
the
injury
under
this
agreement
is
conduct
that
occurred
within
the
last
6
years--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
not
conduct
that
occurred
before
6
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
said
more
than
that.
i
mean,
it
said...
you
quote
it
on
page
25.
it
said...
and
this...
i
wanted
to
ask
you
how
that
got
into
the
federal
register.
it
said,
the
courts
determine
the
scope
of
the
agreement
to
arbitrate,
including
whether
a
matter
is
eligible
for
arbitration
on
subject
matter,
timeliness,
or
other
grounds.
and
that's
the
nasd
in
the
federal...
what's
it
doing
in
the
federal
register?
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it's
the
same
thing
if...
if
you
say
that
the
accident
occurred
somewhere
other
than
in
the
work
place.
and
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i...
can
i
ask
you
about
the
rules,
about
10324
in
particular
which
deals
with
the
interpretation
of
provisions
of
the
code?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
your...
the...
the
other
side
says
that...
that
that
provision
gives
the
arbitrator
the
power
to
decide
whether
6
years
have
elapsed
or
not.
if
it
did
that,
i
suppose
it
would
also
give
the
arbitrator
the
power
to
decide
whether
the
injury
was
one
that
occurred
in
the
work
place;
that
is,
whether
the
subject
matter
was
also--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
see
how
you
could
limit
it
to
the
one
and...
and
not
apply
it
to
the
other,
could
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
shall
be
empowered
to...
so
how
do
you
read
it?
shall
be
empowered
to
interpret
and
determine
the
applicability
of
all
provisions.
how
do
you
read
it?
meaning
what?
once
he
has...
once
he
has
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
within
the
scope
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
starr,
i
guess
the
same
anomaly
occurs
when...
when
the
dispute
goes
to
whether
the
primary
conduct
is
covered.
isn't
there
the
same
anomaly--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
the
court
decides
it?
and
if
the
court
decides
it,
the
arbitration
can't
go
forward
even
though
the
plaintiff
may
have
a
cause
of
action
before
that
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
the
conduct
that...
that
is
not
arbitrable.
