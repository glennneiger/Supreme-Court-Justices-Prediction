stevens
but
if
the
temporal
restriction
then
were
phrased
in
terms
of
no
relief
shall
be
granted
on
a
claim
arising,
then
it
clearly
would
go
to
the
arbitrator.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
clearly
would,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
depends
on
the
wording
of
the
clause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
to
one
of
three...
i
think
they
agreed
to
submit
to
one
of...
of
one
of
three
or
four
different
arbitrators,
and
they
happened
to
pick
this
one.
and
if
the
other
arbitrator
had
different
rules,
it
would
have
had
a
different
result.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
dr.
starr,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
meaning
of
the
rule?
it
may
not
really
be
germane
to
this
ques...
but
i've
been
puzzled.
supposing
you
had
a
case
in
which
the
conduct
occurred
7
years
ago
and
it
was
fraudulently
concealed
until
1
year
before
the
arbitration
is
requested.
would
that
be
arbitrable
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
occurrence
is
7
years
ago.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
is
an
absolute
rule
without
any
tolling
provision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
starr,
can
i
interrupt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the...
the
claimant
files
a
piece
of
paper
saying
the
events
occurred
5
years
and
11
months
ago,
and
the...
a
company
comes
in
and
files
a
piece
of
paper
and
says,
no,
they
occurred
6
years
and
1
month
ago.
it
depends
on
how
you
interpret
it.
who's
going
to
decide
which
is
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
just
filing
a
defensive
pleading
would
oust
the
arbitrator
of
jurisdiction--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--even
though
the
claim
itself
said
it
was
5
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
so...
so
in
my
hypothetical--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
would
be
the
arbitrator's
initial
task
to
resolve
the
question
of
fact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
am
i
correct--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
if
the...
if
the
claimant
files
a
claim
saying
it
happened
5
years
ago,
and
the
company
files
an
answer
saying,
no,
it
happened
6-and-a-half
years
ago,
they
would
immediately
refer
that
to
the
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
make--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
make
their
submission
in
a
motion
to
dismiss,
not
in
an
answer.
they
say
this
is
not
proper...
suited
for
arbitration
because
the
time,
in
fact,
is
different.
justice
stevens
justice
breyer
has
an
opinion
to
announce.
