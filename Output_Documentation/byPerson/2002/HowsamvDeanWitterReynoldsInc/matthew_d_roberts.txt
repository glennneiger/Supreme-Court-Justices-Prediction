mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
two
reasons
the
question
whether
petitioners'
claims
were
submitted
within
the
6-year
time
limit
is
for
the
arbitrators
to
decide.
first,
as
this
court
held
nearly
40
years
ago
in
john
wiley,
when
the
parties
have
agreed
to
submit
the
subject
matter
of
the
underlying
dispute
to
arbitration,
the
question
whether
the
dispute
was
presented
within
a
contractual
time
limit
is
presumptively
for
the
arbitrators
even
if
the
time
limit
is
a
prerequisite
that
conditions
the
duty
to
arbitrate.
second,
the
time
limit
in
this
case
is
imposed
by
the
nasd
code
of
arbitration
procedure,
which
the
parties
incorporated
into
their
agreement
in
full.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
okay.
arbitrability
is,
as
used
in
the
court's
cases,
a
term
of
art
that
includes
two
questions.
one
of
those
questions
is
whether
the
parties
are
bound
by
a
valid
arbitration
agreement
and
the
other
question
is
whether
the
subject
matter
of
their
underlying
dispute
is
within
the
scope
of
that
agreement.
and
by
the
subject
matter
of
their
underlying
dispute,
what
i
mean
is
whether
they
agreed
to
arbitrate
disputes
about
the
primary
conduct
that...
that
has
given
rise
to
the...
to
the
underlying
claim.
and
what
the
court
held
in...
in
john
wiley
is
once
the
parties...
once
the
court
has
determined
that
the
parties
have
agreed
to
arbitrate
disputes
arising
out
of
the...
the
underlying
conduct
that's
at
issue,
then
questions
about
their
litigation
conduct
and
how
those...
how
that
dispute
was
processed
after
it
arose...
those
are
presumptively
for
the
arbitrators
to
decide.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor.
the...
the
agreement
didn't
use
that...
that
language.
it
said
the
failure
of
either
party
to
file
a
grievance
within
this
time
limitation
shall
be
construed
and
be
deemed
to
be
an
abandonment
of
the
grievance.
but
the
point--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--there...
there
may
be--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--there
may
be
differences,
your
honor,
but...
but
the...
the
time
limit
language,
the
eligible
for
submission
language,
what
that
indicates
is
that
the
timely
submission
of
a
claim
is
a
prerequisite
to
arbitration
of
the
merits
of
the
claim.
it
doesn't
say
one
way
or
the
other
who
decides
whether
that
prerequisite
has
been
met.
it
doesn't
say
that
the
timeliness
question
is
not
arbitrable.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
says
the
underlying
claim
is
not
arbitrable--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--if
it's
not
timely.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
you
presume...
you
presume
that
because
if
the
parties
didn't...
didn't
contemplate
that
they
would
arbitrate
about
disputes
arising
from
the...
from
the
underlying
conduct,
which
that
goes
to,
then
they
presumably
didn't
think
the
arbitrators
were
going
to
have
anything
to
do
with
any
questions
connected
with
such
a
dispute.
but
when
they
did...
no.
here...
here
we
know.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
when--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--they
agreed
and
there's...
there's
no
question
about
it
that
they
agreed
that
disputes
that
arose
from
petitioners'
securities
accounts
would
be
within
the...
would
the
kind
of
disputes
that
they
would
arbitrate.
and
so
when
this
claim
arose,
it
was
within
the
scope
of...
of
the
agreement.
and
the
question
here
is
not
whether
it's
the
kind
of
claim
that
the
parties
agreed
that
they
might
arbitrate
about.
it's
a
question
of
whether
a
claim
that
was
arbitrable
when
it
arose
has
become
not
subject
to
arbitration
because
of
the
parties'
litigating
conduct.
and
ordinarily
people...
people
would
assume
that
the...
the
forum
that
they've
selected
to
resolve
the
underlying
dispute
is
going
to
resolve
ancillary
questions
about
how
the
dispute
has
been
processed
and
the
litigating--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--my...
my
distinction
is
between
and
it's
the
distinction
the
court
drew
in
the
john
wiley
case
and
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
followed
for
40
years
except
in...
in
the
limited
context
of
the
question
presented
here.
it's
the...
the
distinction
that's...
that's
been
embodied
in
the
uniform
arbitration
act,
which
is
cited
on
page
14
of
the
reply
brief.
it's
the
distinction
between
the
primary
conduct
and
whether
there's
a
limit
on
what
primary
conduct
is
subject
to
arbitrability
and
other
questions
about...
about
litigating
conduct.
and
the...
the
rule
that
would
focus
on
the
language
of...
of
the
parties
and
parse
that
language
to
see
whether
it's
phrased
as
a
limit
of
arbitrability,
to
then
decide
whether
the
presumption
in
favor
of
courts
deciding
the
question
of
arbitrability
imposes
an
extra
layer
of
complexity
that
doesn't...
it's
not
likely
to
reflect
the...
the
real
intent
of
the
parties.
the...
what
we're
trying
to
figure
out
is
not
whether
the
parties
thought
this
was
a
question
of
arbitrability,
but
who
they
intended
to
decide
the...
who
they
intended
to
decide
the
question.
and
the...
and
when
the
underlying
claim
is
within
the
scope
of
their
agreement,
it's
likely
that
they
intended
that
ancillary
questions
would
be
decided
by
the
party
that
they
committed
the
underlying
dispute
to.
but
even
setting
that
aside,
here
we've
got
10324.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
their
language
reflects
their
intent--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it
reflects
their
intent
that...
that
timely
submission
of
a
claim
is
a
prerequisite
to
arbitration
of
the
merits
of
that
claim.
but
it
doesn't
reflect
their
intent
of
who
is
to
decide
whether
the
prerequisite
is...
is
met.
there's...
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
that.
rule
10324,
which
is
also
a
part
of
the
parties'
agreement,
does
say
something
about
that.
it
says
that
the
arbitrator
shall
be
empowered
to
interpret
and
determine
the
applicability
of
all
code
provisions.
and
the
time
limit
is
a
code
provision.
the
clear
import
of
that,
regardless
of
the
issue
that
we're
discussing,
is
that
the
arbitrators
are
empowered
to
apply
the
time
limit.
and
so,
even
setting
aside
the
40
years
of
law
that's
settled
by
john
wiley
and
the
distinction
between
the
subject
matter
of
the
underlying
dispute
and...
and
questions
that
go
to
the
parties'
litigating
conduct,
the
agreement
here
is
clear
and
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
it's...
it's
concerned...
the...
the
code
is
concerned
with
the
rules
of
the
arbitrable
forum,
and
it
makes
sense
that
the
arbitrators
are
the
ones
to
interpret
and
apply
those
rules.
and
that's
confirmed
by
rule
10324.
but...
but
yes,
the...
the
question
whether
a
claim
is
timely
submitted
goes
not
to
the
character
of
the
underlying
claim
at
the
time
it
arose
and
whether
claims
of
that
character
are
subject
to
arbitration.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
that...
it's
going
to
completely
undermine
the
purpose
of
arbitration,
your
honor.
the
reason
that
people
agree
to
arbitration
is
because
they
want
cost
effective
and
efficient
dispute
resolution,
and
moving
all
these
questions
into
antecedent
judicial
proceedings
is
going
to
delay
dispute
resolution.
it's
going
to
impose
added
costs
on
the
parties,
and
it's
going
to
undermine
the
very
reason
they
agreed
to
arbitrate.
and
it's...
it's...
that's
another
reason
why
it's
just
not
likely
that
that's
what
they
intended...
intended
to
happen.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
it's
a
forum-specific
limit,
and
that's
another
reason
why
it
makes
sense
that
the
forum
that
the
limit
applies
to
should
be
the
one
that...
that
applies
it.
it
says
that
cases
won't
be
eligible
for
arbitration
under
this
code.
it
doesn't
refer
to
whether
they
might
be
pursued
in
other...
in
other
forums
or
other
venues.
it
reinforces
the...
the
expectation
that
the
arbitrators
would
decide
it
which,
in
any
event,
as
i
said,
is...
you
know,
you
can't
get
any
clearer
than
a
rule
that
says
that
the
arbitrator
shall
be
empowered
to
interpret
and
determine
the
applicability
of
all
code
provisions.
thank
you.
