justice
william
h.

we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
01-800,
karen
howsam
v.
dean
witter
reynolds.
mr.
friedberg.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
that
some
of
the
language
in
first
options,
which
the
respondent
relies
on
cuts
against
your
case.
how...
how
do
you
deal
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
respondents
here,
of
course,
argue
that
because
of
the
not
to
be
submitted
clause,
the
6
years,
that
limits
the
scope
of
the...
of
the
arbitration
agreement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
try
again.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
friedberg.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
starr,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can
agree
to
a
temporal
restriction
and
still
not
commit
yourself
as
to
who
decides
whether
that
restriction
is
true.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how...
how
does
the
party
that's
dealing
with
the
nasd
know
that
this
is...
i
mean,
why
should
it
be
bound
by
what
the
nasd
has
said
in
other
contexts?
i
mean,
it's
not
a
government
organization,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i...
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
the
question--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--why
is
these
interpretations
that
are
not
part
of
the
agreement
that
the
respondent
or
the
petitioner
here
signed...
why
are
they
binding
on
the
petitioner?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
we're
just
talking
here,
when
you
say
the
nasd
has
said,
this
is
incorporated
in
the
code
of
procedure
which
she
agreed
to
be
bound
by?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
i
thought...
i
thought
you
said
something
else.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
that
bind
her?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
i
enter
into
a
contract
with
sears
and,
say,
i'll
pay
$300
for
something,
and
then
sears
has
a
publication
which
says,
you
know,
here's
the
warranty
and,
okay,
you
get
the
warranty.
and
then
sears
puts
out
a
magazine
and
says,
what
we
really
mean
in
this
warranty
is
a,
b,
c.
now,
certainly
that
doesn't
affect
the
terms...
how
you
interpret
the
terms
of
the
warranty.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
the
nasd's
interpretation
of
the
rule.
i
mean,
if
you
have
a
private
entity
expressing
a
view
as
to
what
the
contract
means,
i
just
don't
think
it
binds
the
other
side.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
briefly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
starr.
the
case
is
submitted.
