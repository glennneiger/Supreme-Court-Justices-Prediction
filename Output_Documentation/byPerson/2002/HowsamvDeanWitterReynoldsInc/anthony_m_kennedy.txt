justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
justice
ginsburg
asked
a
question
that
i'm
also
interested
in.
quite
apart
from
the
reference
of...
in
the
agreement
to
the
fact
that
the
arbitrator
shall
decide
this,
your
second
argument,
on
your
first
argument,
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
if
i
write
the
opinion
or
another
member
of
the
court
writes
the
opinion
in
your
favor?
if
the
essence
of
the
dispute
involves
the
particular
issue,
then
that
is
arbitrable
and
that's
for
the
arbitrators
to
decide?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
just
don't
know
what
you
want
us
to
write.
it's
the
same
question
justice
ginsburg
had.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is...
what
is
the
general
principle
that
justice
ginsburg
was
asking
for
that
controls
your
first
conclusion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
brings
you
to
