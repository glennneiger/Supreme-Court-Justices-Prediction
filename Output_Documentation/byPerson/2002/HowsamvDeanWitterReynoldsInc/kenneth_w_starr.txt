mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
with
what
we
believe
to
be
the
fundamental
point
in
the
case.
it
has
been
mentioned
in
the
opening
arguments,
and
that
is,
this
is
in
fact
determined
by
contract.
what
did
the
parties
intend?
in
response
to
the
specific
question
posed
by
justice
ginsburg,
the
language
of
at&t
we
think
is
quite
pertinent.
it
says
arbitrability
simply
means
whether
the
parties'
agreement
creates
a
duty
for
the
parties
to
arbitrate
the
particular
grievance,
not
whether
there's
an
arbitration
clause
at
that
level
of
generality.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
believe,
justice
souter,
that
the
language
is
in
fact
clear,
of
10304.
let
me
return
to
that.
but
let
me
go
to
your
point
with
respect
to
litigation
chaos.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
is
going
to
the
issue
of
what
did
at&t
mean
by
the
specific
word
grievance.
what
i
believe
10304
is
is
a
clear
statement
by
the
parties,
leaving
the
first
options
presumption
aside,
which
works
for
us.
if
there
is
any
doubt
as
to
who
decides,
the
presumption
is
the
courts
decide.
but
here
we
know,
by
virtue
of
the
plain
meaning
of
eligible
for
submission.
when
we
couple
that,
since
this
is
an
nasd
rule...
and
what
we
did
not
hear
from
the
sec
was
what
did
the
nasd
intend.
what
have
they
said
this
rule,
which
has
been--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it's
eligible--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--eligible
for
submission.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
justice
souter--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--justice
souter,
we
would
guide
the
court
first
to
the
word
eligible
for
submission.
eligible...
and
the
nasd
has
described...
and
we
set
this
forth
at
page
25
of
the
brief...
specifically
what
it
means
in
this
context.
but
eligible
is
a
very
familiar
term.
it
is
found
in
rule
6
of
the
court,
and
what
it
means
is
if
you're
not
eligible,
you
don't
get
to
this
podium.
you
don't
go
to
the
forum.
and
the
parties
are...
i
think
what
is
essentially
dividing
the
parties
here
today
is
that
there
is
some
sense
that
because
of
john
wiley
&
sons,
the
parties
cannot
agree
to
a
temporal
restriction.
that
makes
no
sense
whatever,
and
indeed
it's
inconsistent
with
the
federal
arbitration
act,
congress'
policy.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
and
that
guides
us...
you're
exactly
right,
and
so
you
then
go
to
what
is
that
temporal
restriction,
and
let's
analyze
that
temporal
restriction.
we
believe
the
words--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
might
very
well
go
to
the
arbitrator--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--under...
under
those
circumstances.
it
all
depends
upon
the
specific
language.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
absolutely.
but
here,
your...
justice
stevens,
we
know...
and
i
would
guide
the
court
or
refer
to
the
court
to
page
25
where
we
summarize
what
the
nasd
has
said
this
is
its
rule.
the
rule
is
applicable
throughout
the
industry.
this
is
commonplace.
this
is
what
the
rule
means,
and
it
is
called
a...
a
jurisdictional
limitation,
a...
a
substantive
jurisdictional
limitation,
and
it
gives
the
reason.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
submission
agreement
in
1997...
and
this
is
commonplace.
in
that
submission
agreement,
the
petitioner
did,
indeed,
agree
to
submit
the
issue
for
arbitration
to
the
nasd
under
the
rules.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
but
they...
they
don't,
and
that's
the
assurance
i
want
to
give
and
why
it's
odd
that
the
sec
has
been
silent
on
this.
the
sec
has
had,
in
terms
of
what
the
industry
knows...
this
is
common
practice
in
the
industry,
this...
this
rule,
the
eligibility
rule
that
you
could
use
at
a
university,
are
you
eligible
for
admission
to
this
university?
eligibility
means
qualified
for
our
justice.
chief...
now
chief
judge
becker
described
in
painewebber
v.
hofmann...
we
quote
that
language
at
page
20.
12
years
ago
he
said,
looking
at
the
dictionary,
at
webster's,
it
can
only
have
one
reasonable
meaning,
and
that
is
qualified
for
it.
one
doesn't
get
in
the
door.
and
there
needs
to
be
a
gatekeeper.
and
it
is,
under
this
court's
presumption...
this
court's
law
and
it's
consistent
with
the
federal
arbitration
act
as
well...
it
makes
sense
for
the
courts
to
be
the
gatekeeper.
and
i
want
to
come,
if
i
may,
to
justice
souter's
concern
about
litigation
chaos.
to
the
contrary.
the
rule
that
is
being
suggested
here
ushers
in
all
manner
of
difficulties
and
we
would
describe
or
refer
the
court,
in
particular...
this
is
in
our
brief...
to
the
edward
jones
v.
sorrells
case.
the
seventh
circuit
had
before
it
the
following
kind
of
question.
eligibility
claim
made.
no
one
went
to
court,
but
an
eligibility
defense
offered
to
the
arbitrators.
the
arbitrators
simply
noted
it.
some
of
these
arbitrations
go
on
for
years.
literally
2
years
is
not
unknown
in
the
industry.
in
that
particular
case,
the
arbitrators
never
decided
the
eligibility
issue.
and
the
nasd
has
said
this...
we
refer
you
to
page
7
of
our
brief,
as
well
as
page
25.
there
was
a
need
for
the
eligibility
rule...
for
that
rule
to
be
clear
and
for
there
to
be
a
gatekeeper.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct.
but
the
issue
is
who
then
decides
whether
this
forum...
who
is
the
gatekeeper?
that's
what's
before
you.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not...
not
at
all
because
if
there
is
a
different
limitation...
and,
indeed,
10304
draws
the
very
distinction
between
the
eligibility
requirement
to
get
in
the
door
of
arbitration
as
opposed
to
a
statute
of
limitation
which
might
vary.
now,
the
6-year
limitation...
the
eligibility
rule...
and
we
would
guide
the
court
back
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
eligible
for
submission.
we
think
that's
clear,
but
we
think
it's
clear
for
the
reasons
chief
judge
becker
said.
but
we
would
again
refer
the
court
to
what
the
nasd
has
said.
it
is
a
substantive
jurisdictional--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
the
self-regulatory
organization,
which
is
what
the
nasd
and
the
exchanges
are,
submit
their
proposed
rules
to
the
sec
which
could
change
this
at
the
stroke
of
a
pen.
it
has
not
done
so
for
lo
these
years
while
these
issues
have
been
languishing
in...
in
the
courts.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
because
she
agreed
in
the
submission
agreement
to
be
bound
by
arbitration
under
the
code
of
procedure.
it's
an
express
agreement
by
her
which
she
signed,
which
goes
back
to
paragraph
19--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
what
i
tried
to
say
is
that
the
nasd
has
described
the
reasons
for
the
rule
to
which
she
agrees.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
binds
her
only
in
the
sense
of
it
helps
the
court
understand
what
the
background
of
the
rule
is.
she
is
bound
the
rule.
we
are
now
moving
to
what
does
the
rule
mean
and
what's
the
purpose
of
the
rule.
we
think,
mr.
chief--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--there
may
very
well
be,
under
those
circumstances,
an
issue
of
whether
there
was
a
contract.
the
other
side
doesn't
dispute
that
there
is
a
contract
and
that
the
nasd
rule
is
a
part
of
the
contract.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i'm
not
suggesting
binding
authority.
i'm
suggesting
that
illumination
is
provided
by
the
nasd's
explanation,
which
also
goes
to
the
purpose.
why
is
this?
is
this
simply
an
arbitrary
rule?
no.
it
is
a
rule
that
is
borne
of
experience
of
the
entire
industry--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
there
would
be
an
issue
that
the
court
would
then
analyze
what
is
the
occurrence
or
event.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
and...
and
in
terms
of
purchase
or
sale
of
security,
it
might
very
well
that
that
would
not
be
arbitrable
in
this
industry
because
of
the
occurrence
or
event.
there
are
also,
as
the
court
knows,
statutes
of
repose
in
the
statute
of
limitation...
in...
in
the
federal
securities
context
as
well.
but
the
point
is
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that's
correct.
it...
it
is
a
absolute
eligibility
rule
that
simply
tells
the
person...
and
again,
there's
no
choice
here
in
the
sense
of
if
she
had
gone
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange
or
the
american
stock
exchange
because
the
rule
is
exactly
the
same.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
justice
breyer,
i
believe
that
the
question
of
arbitrability,
the
duty,
and
who
decides
that
question
is
guided
by
the...
is
determined
by
the
intent
of
the
parties.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
now
look
to
the
contract.
there's
discussion
as
what
does
the
contract
include.
the
parties
have
been
in
agreement
that
the
contract
includes
the
rules,
including
10304.
that
is
the
most
specific
and
targeted
provision,
that
we
then
go
to
that
rule,
and
we
say,
what
is
the
parties'
intent
with
respect
to
whether
this
issue
is
eligible...
this
matter,
dispute,
claim,
or
controversy
shall
be
eligible
for
submission.
it
does
not
say
specifically
the
courts
are
going
to
decide
that.
right?
but
the
first
options
presumption,
since
the
language
is
not
clear
that
the
court
shall
decide
it,
is
that
that
is
the
baseline.
that
is,
in
fact,
the
default
position
unless,
indeed,
the
parties
have
clearly
and
unmistakably
provided
that
that
is
an
issue
for
the
arbitrator.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
and
10324
is,
in
fact,
a
broadly
worded
provision
that
says
on
its
face
that
the
arbitrators
are
empowered
to
decide,
to
interpret,
and
the
like,
the
provisions
of
the
code.
several
points.
the
first
is
this
is
a
very
general,
as
opposed
to
a
quite
specific,
provision,
and
when
we
then
analyze
it,
and
we
analyze
it
in
the
context
of
the
remainder
of
the
code...
and
i
would
guide
the
court
especially
to
rule...
or
section
10104
that
says
arbitrators
shall
be
appointed--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--10104
is
at
page
35--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--of
the
brief,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
that's
10304.
and
then
at
the
bottom
paragraph,
10104
says
that
arbitrators
shall
be
appointed
by
whom?
the
director
of
arbitration
only
for
cases
that
shall
be
eligible
for
submission
under
the
code.
in
other
words,
when
we
take
the
code
and
we
look
at
various
provisions...
and
we
refer
the
court
to
our
footnote
8
on
page
36
of
our
brief
where
we
identify,
justice
kennedy,
a
number
of
provisions
of
the
code
that
cannot,
in
reason,
be
interpreted
by
the
arbitrators.
the
powers
of
the
director
of
arbitration,
by
way
of
example.
we
enumerate
six
examples.
i
think
they're
more
like
17,
but
when
one
goes
through
the
entire
code
of
arbitration
procedure,
one
will
see
a
number
of
provisions
that
the
arbitrators
just
will
not
have
occasion--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--because
it
is
building
in
a
procedural
versus
subject
matter
distinction,
a
sort
of
way
of
looking
at
the
code
as
opposed
to
determining...
and
you
used
the
term,
justice
ginsburg,
statute
of
limitations.
this
is
not
a
statute
of
limitations.
we
would
guide
the
court
again...
refer
the
court
to
the
second
sentence
of
10304
which
draws
the
distinction...
this
also
goes
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question...
that
with
respect
to
this...
the
first
sentence
tells
us,
6
years
eligible
for
submission.
it's
not
eligible
for
submission--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
would
be
a
question
of...
for
the
court.
it's
a
question
of
arbitrability.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no.
under
the...
i'm
sorry.
if
you're
suggesting
that...
and
this
is
the
sorrells
example.
the...
at...
there,
there
has
been,
in
effect,
an
agreement,
as
it
were,
to
allow
the
arbitrators
to
take
that
first
cut
which
comes
back
to
justice
kennedy's
rule.
they
can,
if
the
parties
agree,
make
the
eligibility
determination,
but
if
they
make
it
wrong,
that's
sorrells.
if...
if
the
evidence
is
it's
6
months--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
only
under
the
circumstances
that...
i
want
to
be
very
clear.
the
issue
of
eligibility
is,
in
fact,
a
question
of
arbitrability
and
it's
presumptive...
it
is
for
the
courts
to
decide
absent
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
but--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
you're
suggesting
a
procedural
issue,
namely,
filing
an
answer
which
suggests
to
me
that
the
company
has,
under
those
circumstances,
agreed
for
the
arbitrators
to
decide
that
issue.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
you
can,
under
those
circumstances,
say
the
arbitrators...
i
will
allow
the
arbitrators
to
take
this
initial
cut
at
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
exactly.
and
that's
what--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
you're...
you're
in...
you're
in
the
court.
i
was
trying
to
respond
to
the
specific...
specific
hypothetical,
but
the
principle
is
yes,
you
go
to
the
court.
what
you
would
do
under
those
circumstances
is
not
file
an
answer.
you
would,
in
fact,
say
you
go
to
court
and
you
go
to
court--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--there's...
it's
the
same
principle.
you're
saying
this
is
an
eligible
arbitration.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
are
you
going
to
stand...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
was
just
going
to
say
the
issue
is
are
you
going
to
stand
on
your
rights
under
the
contract.
in
your
hypothetical,
they're
filing
an
answer
which
is
exactly
what
happened
in
sorrells.
it
goes
through
arbitration
and
eventually
this
is...
i
want
to
provide
the
court
again
with
the
sorrells
exam--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
you...
the
point
is
you
would
file
that
in
court.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
justice
breyer,
we're
asking
you
not
to
apply
a
presumption
at
all.
we
want
you
to
follow
the
intent
of
the
parties--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
again,
the
presumption
and
the
analysis
in
first
options
goes
to
where,
in
fact,
the
parties
have
not
spoken
to
this
issue.
we
believe
the
parties
have
spoken
to
the
issue
through
the
nasd
rules
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
stated,
and
that
is,
it's
not
that
we're
seeking
to
build
in
some
new
presumption.
to
the
contrary,
we're
suggesting--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that's
the
standard
with
respect
to...
the
first
options
presumption
works
for
us.
what
we're
relying
on
is
the
intent
of
the
parties
as
articulated
in
the
rules,
and
again,
the
nasd
has
said,
here's
the
reason
for
the
rule.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
same
logic
applies.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
that
they
could.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
once
the
arbitrator
has
juris--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--arbitrators
have
jurisdiction,
they
are
empowered
to
interpret
the
code.
but
it
would
be
passing
strange
to
suggest
that
prior
to
arbitration
a
number
of
the
provisions
of
the
code
precede
the
appointment
of
the
arbitrators
and
go
to
the
powers
of
the
director
of
arbitration.
therefore,
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
the
arbitrators
can
by
virtue
of
the
all
language,
which
this
court
has
said
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
twa,
any
number
of
contexts,
to
the
effect
that
that
breadth,
if
anything,
raises
ambiguity.
i
just
to...
if
i
may
respond,
i
believe
again
the
first
options
presumption
is
the
default
presumption.
but
we
would
guide
the
court
and
we
rest
our
case
on
10304--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that's
correct,
because
we
think
the
parties'
intent
is
clear
and
the
nasd
is
clear
with
respect
to
why
this
rule
exists.
it
exists
because
long,
stale
claims,
as
good
as
the
arbitration
forum
is...
and
it's
a
very
fine
forum.
it's
been
used
in
the
industry
since
1872.
but
it
does
not
work
for
long,
stale
claims.
you
can't
say
let's
arbitrate
a
claim
from
1929--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it's
not
odd
in
this
context
where
the
original
agreement...
there
was
not,
justice
ginsburg,
an
agreement,
in
paragraph
19
of
the
original
client
access
agreement,
to
arbitrate
in
some
generic,
undifferentiated
way.
it
is
to
arbitrate
under
the
rules
of
either
a
self-regulatory
organization
or
an
exchange--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it's
the...
it's--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it's
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
is
the
same
principle
in
terms
of
to
what
did
the
parties
agree.
and
i
think
justice
ginsburg
is
resisting...
i'm
inferring...
resisting
the
idea
that
something
that
is
in
the
code
could
somehow
be
in
the
contract.
we
would
respectfully
disagree
and
say
that
will,
indeed,
create
havoc
in
the
securities--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
guide
you
back
to
10304
and
its
language
and
the
term
eligible.
i
think,
with
all
due
respect,
that
that
interpretation
does
grave
violence
to
the
term
eligible
for
submission.
eligible
cannot
mean
that
you
go
to
the
university
and
then
they
said,
whoops,
you're
now
out.
it
cannot...
and
there
needs
to
be
a
gatekeeper
here--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--your
honor--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--may
i
briefly
respond?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
justice
ginsburg,
our
submission
is
rigorously
enforce
the
contract.
this
is
part
of
the
contract.
that
is
what
dean
witter
v.
byrd
says.
