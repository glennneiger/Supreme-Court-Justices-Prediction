justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i
didn't
understand
it
that
way.
i
thought
the
question
was
not
what
the
parties
intend.
it's
how
we
find
out
what
they
intend.
and
i
thought
we're
trying
to
decide
between
a
tough
burden
of
proof
standard
on
that
that
favors
courts
and
where
you
apply
no
burden
of
proof
standard
or,
if
anything,
favor
the
arbitration.
in
both
instances,
we're
trying
to
find
out
what
the
party
intended.
but
we
assume
that
they
intended
court
unless
there
is
clear
and
convincing
evidence
they
wanted
this
arbitrable.
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
then
i
may
not
have
stated
it
correctly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
of
course,
and
i
thought
what
my
opinion
said
was
that
when
we're
trying
to
decide
whether
they
agreed
to
arbitrate
or
not,
we
apply
a
fairly
tough
standard.
they
have
to
show
rather
clearly
that
they
did.
what
were
the...
what
was
the
word
you
quoted
at
the
beginning
from
the
opinion?
didn't
you
quote
a
phrase
that
said
on
that...
in
deciding
whether
an
issue
is
arbitrable,
we
apply
the
standard
of?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
i'm
sorry.
you
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
get
the
phrase
and
then...
i'm
not
communicating.
i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'd...
i'd
like
you
to
go
back
to
what
i
thought
was
the
key
question,
justice
ginsburg's
initial
question.
what
is
this
term
arbitrability?
now,
the
context...
i've
gotten
not
to
an
answer,
but
i've
gotten
to
a
beginning
with
first
options.
first
options
says
that
the
question
of
whether
you
agreed
to
arbitration
is
basically
a
matter
of
intent
and
apply
state
law.
that's
the
basic
rule.
then
there's
a
subsidiary
rule.
the
subsidiary
is,
but
if
what
you're
interested
in
is
whether
the
parties
agreed
to
arbitrate
the
question
of
arbitrability...
see
justice
ginsburg
says
what
is
that...
at
subsidiary
rule,
what
you
do
is
assume
that
silence
means
no
because
only
if
it's
clear
and
unmistakable.
then
first
options
goes
on
to
say
we'll
give
you
a
couple
of
examples.
an
example
whether
or
not
a
particular
merits-related
dispute
is
arbitrable
because
it
was
within
the
scope
of
a
valid
arbitration
agreement,
that
is
not
a
question
of
arbitrability.
why
not?
because
the
parties,
after
all,
have
a
contract
for
arbitrability.
they
thought
about
the
question
of
arbitrability.
it
won't...
it...
it's
all
very
likely
that
they
wanted
this
whole
thing
to
be
arbitrable.
and
then
they
give
you
an
example
of
where
it
is,
where
there
is
no
contract,
where
there
is
nothing,
where
the
parties
never
thought
about
arbitration,
in
all
likelihood.
now,
with
those
examples,
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
honing
in
on
but
we
don't
have
yet
an
answer
to
the
question
justice
ginsburg
asked.
well,
if
there's
a
contract
and
it's
a
thing
they
likely
thought
about
and
it's
sort
of
a
minor
subsidiary
thing
and,
after
all,
it's
something
that
the
arbitrator
knows
about
and
courts
don't,
that
would
all
say
it's
not
about
arbitrability
in
the
sense
of
requiring
a
special
presumption.
but
if
there's
nothing
at
all
in
writing,
if
it's
something
courts
know
about,
there
is.
all
right.
that's
where
i
am.
that
doesn't
help
you
because
i
think
in
this
case,
yours
would
fall
in
the
first
category.
but,
nonetheless,
i'd
appreciate
a
response
because
i...
i
need
my
thinking
developed
on
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
we
agree
with
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
step
back
one
second...
one
second
from
these
details
you're
in?
because
i'm
seeing
it
not
as
a
matter
of
detail.
what
we're
after
is
the
parties'
intent.
in
most
places
in
the
law,
the
law
of
arbitration
in
this
area
is
either
neutral
or
sometimes
favorable
to
arbitration.
but
there
is
one
exception.
the
one
exception
is
where
the
parties
may
or
may
not
have
agreed
to
arbitrate
arbitrability.
and
there
we,
interestingly
enough,
use
a
presumption
that's
very
hostile
to
finding
the
intent
to
have
the
arbitrators
arbitrate
arbitrability.
now,
in
terms
of
the
reason
for
that
hostility,
how
does
that
apply
here?
i
would
think,
at
first
blush,
it
shouldn't
apply
at
all.
why?
because
we're
talking
about
rules
of
an
arbitration
forum.
and
rules
of
an
arbitration
forum...
after
all,
they're
more
expert
in.
and
moreover,
the
parties
have
agreed
to
go
to
arbitration
in
a
lot
of
circumstances
anyway,
so
they
at
least
know
something
of
what
they're
talking
about.
why
would
we
want
to
apply
so
hostile
an
interpret...
hostile
a
presumption
as
to
what
their
intent
really
is
in
this
kind
of
an
area?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
fine.
if
no
exception...
if
no...
if...
if
that's
really
what
you
mean,
then
you
do
not
mean
that
there
has
to
be
clear
and
unmistakable
evidence.
what
i
mean
by
my
assumption
is
these
words,
clear
and
unmistakable
evidence,
because
once
we're
out
of
that
box,
then
i
think
we're
right
into
what
justice
kennedy
said
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
but,
i
mean,
it's
only
those
words,
clear
and
unmistakable,
that
help
you,
and
that's
what
i
mean
by
the
hostile
presumption.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
but
you...
you
agree...
you
want
it
clear
and
unmistakable
or
not?
is
that
the
standard
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
you
don't
think
you
even
need
it.
you
don't
think
you
even
need
the
presumption.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case
is
howsam
v.
dean
witter
concerns
an
arbitration
rule
of
the
national
association
of
securities
dealers.
the
rules
says
that
no
dispute
"shall
be
eligible
for
submission
to
arbitration
where
six
years
have
elapsed
from
the
occurrence
or
event
giving
rise
to
the
dispute."
it
is
a
kind
of
a
statute
of
limitation.
now,
that
nasd
rule
ended
up
being
incorporated
into
an
arbitration
agreement
that
dean
witter
had
made
with
a
customer,
karen
howsam
and
it
consequently
became
relevant
to
the
resolution
a
dispute
between
them.
howsam
wanted
the
dispute
submitted
to
nasd
arbitration
and
dean
witter
thought
it
was
too
late
that
the
six
years
had
expired
and
wanted
the
whole
thing
dismissed.
dean
witter
went
to
court
to
try
to
get
the
judge
to
interpret
that
particular
rule,
and
the
question
before
us
is
who
should
interpret
and
apply
that
six-year
rule,
the
court,
which
is
what
dean
witter
claims,
or
the
association
arbitrator?
of
course,
in
a
sense
we
should
simply
look
to
the
arbitration
contract
between
the
parties
to
decide
that
question
for
arbitration
is
a
matter
of
contract
but
the
contract,
when
you
look
quite
understandably
because
this
is
detail
and
quite
typically
simply
says
nothing
about
the
matter.
so,
instead,
we
have
to
look
to
certain
court-developed
rules
for
guidance
about
how
we
ought
to
interpret
this
silence
in
the
contract.
now,
if
you
look
at
those
rules,
almost
all
of
them
in
the
area
favor
looking
to
arbitration
because
the
court's
cases
generally
favor
arbitration,
but
there
is
one
rule,
an
interpretive
rule
that
does
not
favor
arbitration
and
that
is
the
rule
that
says
the
"question
of
arbitrability
itself,
i.e.,
whether
or
not
a
matter
is
arbitrable
is
a
matter
for
the
court
to
decide
unless
the
parties
clearly
and
unmistakably
provide
otherwise."
now,
dean
witter,
like
the
court
of
appeals
below,
says,
"well,
the
nasd
six-year
time
limit
rule
is
a
rule
that
stands
at
the
gateway
of
arbitration."
if
you
fail
the
rule,
you
do
not
get
there,
and
it
adds
the
application
of
the
nasd
rule
will
decide
whether
the
parties
can
or
cannot
proceed
to
arbitration
and
for
that
reason,
dean
witter
concludes,
application
of
the
nasd
rule
presents
a
question
of
arbitrability
presumptively
for
the
court,
not
for
the
arbitrator.
but,
in
our
view,
the
statute
of
limitations-type
question
at
the
nasd
rule
does
not
raise
a
question
of
arbitrability
at
least
as
this
court's
case
law
has
used
that
phrase.
the
nasd
rule
does
not
concern
such
major
threshhold
matters
as
whether
the
parties
are
bound
at
all
by
an
arbitration
contract
and
that
is
pretty
much
what
this
court
is
meant
by
question
of
arbitrability.
rather,
it
concerns
a
procedural
manner
tied
to
the
workings
of
the
arbitration
process
itself.
this
court's
precedent,
commentary
on
the
manner,
common
sense,
all
suggest
that
this
kind
of
procedural
issue
directly
related
to
arbitration
is
better
handled
by
arbitrators
and
that
the
court
should
presume
that
the
arbitration
contract,
silent
on
the
point,
intends
to
leave
the
issue
to
the
nasd
arbitrator
not
to
judges
to
decided.
now,
our
opinion
spells
out
in
some
detail
why
that
is
so.
we
reverse
a
decision
to
the
contrary
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
o'connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
