--definition
of
the
domain
of
arbitrability?
you're
saying
shall
be
eligible
for
submission
just
means
that
the
arbitration
forum
doesn't
get
to
the
merits
if
more
than
6
years
have
elapsed.
but...
so
you
say
that's
not
a
question
of
arbitrability
but
how
the
arbitrator
will
proceed.
what
is
your
definition
of
arbitrability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
question
that
doesn't
go
to
the
arbitrator...
you're
saying
this
one
does.
it's
just
he
has
to
take
it
up
first...
or
she.
but
we're
dealing
with,
if
it's
a
question
of
arbitrability,
the
courts
decide
it.
if
it's
not
a
question
of
arbitrability,
but
the...
the
range
of
other
questions,
then
it's
for
the
arbitrator.
so
my
question
is,
what...
the
domain
for
the
court...
the
question
is
it
arbitrable
is
a
question
for
the
court.
what
is
the
content
of
that
label,
arbitrable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
friedberg,
do
you
disagree
with
the
government?
the
government
did
say
there
are
two
considerations.
the
first
one
you
agree
with
obviously,
whether
the
parties
entered
into
a
binding
arbitration
agreement.
and
then
the
government
says
there's
a
second
question,
that
is,
whether
the
subject
matter
of
the
dispute
falls
within
the
scope
of
that
agreement.
those
are
the
two
things.
you
seem
to
be
saying
there's
only
the
one,
did
they
agree
to
arbitrate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
are
you
saying
essentially
the
parties
have
an
agreement
to
arbitrate,
and
that
looks
like
very
broad,
any
and
all
questions,
and
then
there's
this
code
of
procedure?
so
what
the
nasd
code
is
directed
to
is
how,
if
the
arbitrator
has
authority,
the
arbitrator
is
to
proceed.
is
that
essentially
what
you're
saying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
this
6-year
is
a
statute
of
limitations
for
the
arbitration
forum?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
it
says
nothing
about
if
the
case
were
in
court
what
the
limitation
would
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
thought
that...
that
what
it
says,
this
rule
says...
one
interpretation
of
it,
plausible
interpretation,
is
arbitrators
decide
the
eligibility
question
first.
do
you
agree,
mr.
starr,
that
this
6-year
rule
is
a
rule
for
the
arbitration
forum?
that
is,
suppose
this
dispute
now
goes
to
court
and
the
court
says,
we
think
that
the
6-year
limit
has
not
been
met.
then
the
customer
says,
fine,
court,
but
under
new
york
law,
the
limit,
if
we're
in
court,
is
10
years
and
i'm
well
within
that.
this
is
a
limit,
as
i
understand
it,
this
6-year
limit,
is
for
the
arbitration
forum
only,
not
for
the
dispute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
now...
now,
that's
my
puzzle
because
isn't
it
odd
that
a
limitation
period
that
applies
only
in
the
arbitration
forum
is
then
decided
by
a
court
where
the
court
would
have
a
different
limitation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
are
not...
but
that
those...
those
provisions
are
not
ones
that
the
court
decides
either.
and
i'd
like
you,
mr.
starr,
to
tell
me
why
i'm
wrong,
because
i
take
it
from
your
argument
you
would
say
i'm
wrong,
in
saying
we
have
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
signed
by
the
broker
and
the
customer.
that
seems
to
be
as
broad
as
you
can
get.
and
then
we
have
a
code
of
procedure
which
says,
if
you
are
going
to
use
the
nasd
auspices,
these
are
the
procedural
rules,
including
statute
of
limitations,
which
you
should
decide
up
front
and
not
after
you've
decided
the
merits.
limitations
first,
then
merits.
if
i
think
of
this
as
the
agreement
is
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
sets
what's
arbitrable,
then
the
code
of
procedure
is
how
you
proceed
in
the
arbitration
forum.
what
is
wrong
with
that
division?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
nobody
is
questioning
the
6-year
limitation,
and
the
question
is
who
decides
it.
and
i'm
still
left
with
the
anomaly
that
a
limitation,
applicable
only
in
the
arbitration
forum,
gets
decided
by
a
court.
it's
not
a
limitation
on
court
action.
it's
not
an
all-purpose.
it's
not
saying
this...
these
parties
will
arbitrate...
will...
will
have
this
dispute.
this
dispute
will
be
dead
after
6
years.
you've
conceded
that
that's
not
so.
the
dispute
might
be
alive
for
12
years
depending
on
what
the
state
law
is.
isn't
it
odd
that...
to
read
a
contract
to
say
that
a
rule
governing
only
the
arbitration
forum
and
not
the
court
is
decided
by
the
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
would--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
i
was
saying
is
that
there's
a
difference
between
a
code
of
procedure
that
says
we
agree
to
arbitrate
and
then
this
is
the
rules
governing
the
arbitration
forum
when
you're
in
arbitration.
the
parties
have
agreed
to
a
code
of
procedure
for
arbitration.
that's
how
i'm
reading
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
could
be
if
you
say
that
all
this
is
is
a
code
of
procedure,
like
the
federal
rules.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
that's
what
you...
if
you
say
we
opt
for
arbitration
and
we
opt
for
it
to
proceed
under
this
set
of
procedural
rules.
