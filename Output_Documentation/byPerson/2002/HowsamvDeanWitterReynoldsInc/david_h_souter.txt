justice
david
h.
souter
--is...
is
that
your
criterion,
that...
that...
the...
on...
on
the
question
of
what...
arbitrability
turns
on
the
question,
do
you
get
in
front
of
the
particular
person
or
tribunal
at
all
as
opposed
to
how
long
do
you
stay
when
you
get
there?
in
other
words,
if...
if
it's
a
question
of
whether
you
get
there
at
all,
it's...
the
question
is
arbitrability
and
the
presumption
goes
one
way.
if
the
question
is
how
long
you
stay
there
if
you
get
in
front
of
that
person,
that's
not
an
arbitrability
question
and
the
presumption
goes
the
other
way.
is
that...
that's
your
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
you're
saying,
i
guess,
is
that
if
the...
if
the
allegation
of
harm
falls
within
the
subject
of
the
arbitration
clause,
everything
goes
to
the
arbitrator
unless
they
have
unmistakably
said
that
some
subsidiary
issue
does
not.
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
and
haven't
we
got
to
take
that
position?
because
otherwise
we're
just
going
to
have
litigation
chaos?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
a
grievance...
i
mean,
isn't
the
point
of
speaking
of
grievance
just
what
mr.
roberts
said?
the
grievance
has
got
to
refer
to
the
primary
conduct
causing
injury.
if
it
is
not
limited
to
that,
in
the
absence
of
unmistakable
language,
then
we're
going
to
have
a
trial
before
every
arbitration
if
there
is
any
procedural
or
other
defense
that
could
be
raised.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
is
your
submission
argument,
your...
your
argument
based
on
the...
on
the
word
submission.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
submission...
i
just
don't
see
how
submission
can
decide
this
case
because
you
can
say
the...
the
ultimate
issue
is
submitted
when
the...
when
the
whole
case
goes
to
the
arbitrator,
or
you
can
say
it
is
submitted
when
the
arbitrator
gets
beyond
procedural
issues
and
gets
down
to
the
issue
of
the
primary
conduct
that
caused
the
injury.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
don't
see
how
submission
is...
is
going
to
be
the...
the
deciding
factor.
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
the
whole
reason
for
filing
the
answer
is
to
get
it
out
of
the
arbitration.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
why
you
file.
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
can,
but
what
if
you
don't
say
that?
what
if
you
say,
i
am
saying
it
was
6
years
and
1
month
and
for
that
reason
this
eligibility
question
is
jurisdictional
and
it
goes
to
a
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
and
if
that's
what
they
say,
then
they
go
to
the
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
all
they've
got
to
do
is
file
a
paper
and
we're
out
of
arbitration
and
into
court.
and
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--all
right.
and...
and
doesn't
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no.
you
go
ahead.
