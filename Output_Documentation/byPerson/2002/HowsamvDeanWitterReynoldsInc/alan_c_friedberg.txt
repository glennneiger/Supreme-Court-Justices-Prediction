mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
at
least
a
little
irony
in
the
fact
that
dean
witter
is
the
litigant
here
before
you,
about
27
years
past
the
time
when
it
started
with
dean
witter
and
byrd
the...
the
move
toward
closing
the
courthouse
doors
to
public
investors
and
forcing
them
into
industry-run
arbitration.
dean
witter
is
now
back
here
attempting
to
place
a
hurdle
in
the
way
of
the
public
investor
who
ironically
at
this
point
seeks
to
enforce
an
arbitration
agreement.
the
issue
today
before
the
court
is
the
extent
to
which
the
industry
and
dean
witter
may
now
invoke
court
involvement
to
interfere
with
a
customer's
claims
before
arbitration
and...
and
to
decide
whether
the
customer's
claims
are
timely
under
a
section
of
an
arbitration
code
providing
for
a
time
limitation
on
eligibility.
the
issue
is
who
decides.
it
is
clear
that...
that
over
the
years
a
presumption
has
developed
in
favor
of
arbitrability
where
there
is
an
arbitration
clause
in
a
contract.
and
the
cases
say
that
that
presumption
can
only
be
overcome
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
parties
agreed
to
have
a
court
decide
arbitrability
issues
within
a...
within
the
scope
of
an
arbitration
agreement.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
evidence.
the
arbitration
clause
in
the
1992
agreement
between
the
parties
is
as
broad
a
clause
as
one
can
imagine.
the
client
agrees
that
all
controversies
between
her
and
dean
witter
concerning
or
arising
from
any
account
or
any
transaction
involving
dean
witter
and
the
client,
whether
or
not
it
occurred
in
the
account,
or
the
construction,
performance,
or
breach
of
this
or
any
other
agreement
between
us.
it's
an
industry-designed
arbitration
clause,
meant
to
be
as
broad
as
possible.
the
intent
clearly
is
to
move
cases
against
brokers
by
customers
out
of
the
courts
and
into
arbitration.
that...
that
1992
agreement
was,
of
course,
followed
by
a
1997
submission
agreement
signed
by
ms.
howsam
which
merely
states
that
as
an
undersigned
party,
she
and
her
trust
submit
the
present
matter
in
controversy,
as
set
forth
in
the
attached
statement
of
claim,
to
arbitration
in
accordance
with
the
constitution,
by-laws,
rules,
regulations,
and/or
code
of
arbitration
procedure
of
the
sponsoring
organization.
in
this
case,
it's
the
nasd,
but
the...
the
other
self-regulatory
organizations
and
exchanges
have
similar
rules
to
the
6-year
rule.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
well,
first
of
all,
first
options
is
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
question
about
whether
an
arbitration
agreement
existed,
which
is
not
the
case
here.
and
justice
breyer,
writing
for
the
court,
wrote
that...
that
in
that
situation,
the
presumption
shifts.
the
at&t
case...
clearly
the...
when
the
question
is
just
the
scope
of
an
arbitration
agreement,
but
there
is
no
question
about
the
existence
of
the
agreement,
there
needs
to
be
clear
and
unmistakable
evidence
of
an
intent
to
have
the
courts
decide
rather
than
the
arbitrators
decide.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
the...
the
respondent,
of
course,
is...
is
referring
to
rule
10304,
which
says
that...
that
disputes
which
arose
out
of
transactions
or
events
more
than
6
years
prior
are
not
eligible
for
submission
to
arbitration.
first
of
all,
that...
that
rule
is
found
in
a
section
of
the
arbitration
code.
it's
not
found
in
the
agreement
itself.
and
it's
found
in
a
section
of
the
code
of
arbitration
procedure.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
exactly,
justice
scalia.
and
the
point
i
was...
was
trying
to
make
is
that...
that
the
code
has
to
be
read
as...
as
one
code
in
that...
in
that
respect.
the...
it's
also,
i
think,
illuminating
that
the...
the
section,
the
300
series
of
the
code
in
which
that
is
found,
is...
is
not
the
eligibility
section
in
the
sense
that
the
100
series
is.
the
300
series
is...
is
basically
a
procedural,
instructive
portion
of
the
code
for
the
arbitrators
to
apply.
there
is
some...
we...
we've
made
the
argument
and...
and
i
think
it's
a
valid
argument...
that
eligible
for
submission
can
mean
a
number
of
things.
and...
and
that
it
refers,
in
this
case
to...
it
could
refer
in
this
case
to
when
the
arbitrators
take
the
case
under
submission,
just
as
this
court
takes
the
case
under
submission
after
the
petition,
after
the
briefing,
after
the
arguments
are
made.
there...
there
is,
of
course,
the
need
to
get
the
case
in
front
of
a
tribunal
in
order
to...
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
case
is
timely.
so
while
the
rule
may
prevent
the
case
from
going
all
the
way
to
the
end
zone,
it...
it
certainly
doesn't
prevent
the...
the
litigant
from
or
the...
the
person
arbitrating
from...
from
getting
out
of
the
starting
gate.
moreover--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--that...
that
is
one
point,
justice
souter.
the...
the
other
point
that...
that
needs
to
be
made
is
that
whether
or
not
this
is
part
of
the
code,
part
of
an
agreement,
it
falls
within
the
john
wiley
and
moses
cone
case
law
as
opposed
to
the
first
options
holding.
and
in...
in
john
wiley,
if
the
court
will
recall,
there
were
prerequisites,
timeliness
prerequisites,
to
filing
for
arbitration,
which
the
court
said,
because
there
was
an
arbitration
agreement
and
there
was
no
dispute
about
that,
were
for
the
arbitrators
to
decide.
in
moses
h.
cone
hospital,
there
were...
there
were
prerequisites
of
timeliness.
the...
as
i
recall,
the
arbitration
had
to
be
filed
within
30
days
after
an
opinion
by
an
architect
as
to
the
disputed
contracting
claims.
and
so...
and...
and
the
court...
the
court
clearly
said
in
moses
cone
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
establishes
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
any
doubts
concerning
the
scope
of
arbitrable
issues
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
arbitration,
whether
the
contract
involves
construction
of
the
contract
language
itself
or
an
allegation
of
waiver,
delay,
or
a
like
defense
to
arbitrability.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
justice
ginsburg,
our...
our
definition
of
arbitrability
i
think
has
to
be
broader
than
that.
but
there
is...
there
is
the
merits
arbitrability.
there
is
the--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--it's
a
hard
question
for
me
to
get
my
hands
around,
justice
ginsburg,
but
there...
there
is
no
question
that
in
the
first
instance
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
a
claim
is...
is
arbitrable.
and...
and
if
the
court
finds
that...
that
there
is
an
arbitration
clause
that
covers
the
merits
of
the
dispute,
then
the
court
should
defer
to
arbitrators
on
any
question
regarding
scope.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
i
don't
think--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--right.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
right.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
i
believe
not,
justice
scalia.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
well--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--well--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--i'm
not--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--i
don't
think
there
is
either,
justice
scalia.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
precisely.
i
think
what
we
have
to
do
is
look
to
the
case
law,
including
the
att
case
and...
and
its
progeny,
and
first
options
says
the
same
thing
really,
that
the
court
has
to
decide
in
the
first
instance
is
there
an
arbitration
agreement.
having
decided...
and
in
this
case
it's
undisputed...
that
there
is
an
arbitration
agreement,
then
the
question
is,
does
it
go
to
the
substance
of
the
case
or
is
it
a
matter
of
the
scope?
and
the
cases
say,
starting
with
the
gulf
and
warrior--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--that...
that's
what--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--right.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
but
the
question
is
who
will
decide
a
certain
issue
of
arbitrability,
and
at&t
and...
and
moses
h.
cone
and
first
options
even
says
that
once
you
find
that
there's
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
the
substance
of
the...
the
dispute,
then
the
question
is
did
the
parties,
by
unmistakable
evidence,
agree
that
the
courts,
rather
than
the
arbitrators,
would
decide
that
scope
issue.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
i'm
saying--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--there...
there's
a--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--i
think
that's
true
for
that
threshold
issue,
but
if
we
get
to
a
point
where
all
issues
that...
that
may
preclude
ultimately
submitting
the
case
to
the
arbitrators
for
determination
have
to
be
decided
by
the
court,
then
we're
running
afoul
of
john
wiley.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
i
think
you're
wrong,
justice
breyer,
although--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--i
think
what...
what
the...
again,
what
the
initial
issue
for
the
court
is,
did
the
parties
agree
to
arbitrate
the
substance
of
the
dispute.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
i
believe
i
quoted
from
the
moses
h.
cone--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--decision
which...
which
says...
which
says
that
the
presumption
is
in
favor
of
the
arbitrator's
deciding.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
no.
i--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--justice
kennedy,
it's
basically
what
was
announced
in
the
at&t
case
when
it
was
sent
back
to
the
court
to
decide
who
decides
certain
questions.
the
court
should
decide
in
this
case
that
where
there's
a
valid,
written
agreement
to
arbitrate
the
subject
matter
or
the
merits
of
the
dispute,
particularly
where
the
arbitration
clause
encompasses
all
controversies
and
the
parties
have
not
clearly
and
unmistakably
reserved
certain
issues
of
arbitrability
for
a
court
decision
and...
and
i
mean,
within
the
scope
as
opposed
to
the
basic
dispute...
the
presumption
in
favor
of
arbitrability
should
apply,
and
issues
relating
to
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
agreement
are
for
the
arbitrators.
and
in
this
case...
at&t,
when
the
court
sent
the
case
back
to
the
lower
court
said,
these
issues
are
for
the
arbitrators
to
decide
unless
you
find
unmistakable
evidence
that
the
parties
agreed...
and
this
is
the
intent
of
the
parties...
that
the
court
would
decide.
i...
i
would
like
to
reserve--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--no.
i'm
not...
obviously
i'm
not
doing
a
very
good
job
of
expressing
our
position.
where
the
subject
matter
of
the
dispute,
the
merits-related
issue...
as
in
first
options,
it
was
the
question
of
whether
the
kaplans
owed
money
or
not...
is
within
an
arbitration
agreement,
then
any
ancillary
type
dispute
as
to
timeliness
should
go
to
the
arbitrators
to--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--i
think
in
the
first
instance
the
court
would
decide
that
because
the
parties
did
not
agree
to
arbitrate
any
claims.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
because--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--because--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--because
of
the
principle,
justice
scalia,
set
out
in
the
john
wiley
case
and
the
moses
h.
cone--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--i...
i
think
because
the
court
has
previously
said
that
a
timeliness
issue
is...
is
a
procedural
issue.
it's
intertwined
with...
with
substantive
issues,
of
course,
but--
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
--they
could
but
they
didn't
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
c.
friedberg
that...
that
is
what
our
position
is.
