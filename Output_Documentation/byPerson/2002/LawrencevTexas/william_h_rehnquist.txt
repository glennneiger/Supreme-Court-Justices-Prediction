chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
02-102,
john
geddes
lawrence
and
tyron
garner
v.
texas.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
your
substantive
due
process
submission,
mr.
smith,
certainly,
the
kind
of
conduct
we're
talking
about
here
has
been
banned
for
a
long
time.
now
you
point
to
a
trend
in
the
other
direction,
which
would
be
fine
if
you're
talking
about
the
eighth
amendment,
but
i
think
our
case
is
like
glucksberg,
say,
if
you're
talking
about
a
right
that
is
going
to
be
sustained,
it
has
to
have
been
recognized
for
a
long
time.
and
that
simply
isn't
so.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
it's
about
procreation
or
nonprocreation,
but
none
of
the
cases
that
you
have
talked
about
involved
nonprocreation,
did
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all...
almost
all
laws
are
based
on
disapproval
of
either
some
people
or
some
sort
of
conduct.
that's
people
legislate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
you
prevail,
mr.
smith,
and
this
law
is
struck
down,
do
you
think
that
would
also
mean
that
a
state
could
not
prefer
heterosexuals
to
homosexuals
to
teach
kindergarten?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
smith.
mr.
rosenthal,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
we
should
go
through
counsel,
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosenthal.
mr.
smith,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
smith.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-102,
lawrence
against
texas
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
