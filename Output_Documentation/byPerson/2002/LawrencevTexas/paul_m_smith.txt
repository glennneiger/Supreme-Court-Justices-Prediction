mr.
paul
m.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
texas
in
this
case
claims
the
right
to
criminally
punish
any
unmarried
adult
couple
for
engaging
in
any
form
of
consensual
sexual
intimacy
that
the
state
happens
to
disapprove
of.
it
further
claims
that
there's
no
constitutional
problem
raised
by
a
criminal
statute
that
is
directed
not
just
at
conduct,
but
at
a
particular
group
of
people,
a
law
that
criminalizes
forms
of
sexual
intimacy
only
for
same-sex
couples
and
not
for
anyone
else
in
the
state
who
has...
has
the
right
to
make
a
free
choice
to
engage
in
the
identical
conduct.
petitioners
are
two
adults
who
were
arrested
in
a
private
home
and
criminally
convicted
simply
because
they
engaged
in
one
of
the
forms
of
sexual
intimacy
that
is
on
the
banned
list
in
the
state
of
texas
for
same-sex
couples.
they
bring
two
constitutional
claims
to
the
court
today.
first,
among
the
fundamental
rights
that
are
implicit
in
our
concept
of
order
of
liberty,
must
be
the
right
of
all
adult
couples,
whether
same-sex
or
not,
to
be
free
from
unwarranted
state
intrusion
into
their
personal
decisions
about
their
preferred
forms
of
sexual
expression.
second,
there's
no
legitimate
and
rational
justification
under
the
equal
protection
clause
for
a
law
that
regulates
forms
of
sexual
intimacy
that
are
permitted
in
the
state
only
for
same-sex
couples,
thereby
creating
a
kind
of
a
second
class
citizenship
to
that
group
of
people.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
court's
cases,
mr.
chief
justice,
say
that
history
is
a
starting
point,
not
the
end
point
of
the
analysis.
and
i
think
that
it's
important
to
look
at
history
as
a
whole
and
one
of
the
errors
that
i
think
that
the
court
made
in
bowers
v.
hardwick
was
only
looking
at
the
issue
in
terms
of
homosexual
sodomy
and
not
looking
at
the
issue
in
general
terms,
which
is
the
right
of
everyone
to
decide
for
themselves
about
consensual
private
sexual
intimacy.
if
you
look
at
the
history
as
a
whole,
you
find
a
much
more
complicated
picture.
first
of
all,
you
find
that
sodomy
was
regulated
going
back
to
the
founding
for
everyone
and
indeed
the
laws
in
the
19th
century
didn't
focus
on
same-sex
couples,
they
focused
on
particular--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
it
does
come
into
it,
because
if
you're
going
to
suggest
that
the
state
of
the
law
in
the
books
in
the
19th
century
is
the
touchstone
you
have
to
take
into
account
that
in
the
19th
century
at
least
on
the
face
of
the
law
married
couples
were
regulated
in
terms
of
their
forms
of
sexual
intimacy
that
were
created
for
them.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
indeed,
they
all
were,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
guess
i'm
suggesting
mr....
justice
scalia,
that
it's
been
conceded
here
by
this
state,
it
was
conceded
by
the
state
of
georgia
17
years
ago,
that
married
couples
can't
be
regulated
as
a
matter
of
substantive
due
process
in
their
personal
sexual
expression
in
the
home.
that
means
that
the
state
of
the
law
on
the
books
in
the
19th
century
can't
be
the
deciding
factor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor.
that
may
well
be
true.
i
was...
i
was
working
with
the
assumption
that
there
may
be
justices
who...
of
the
view
that
married
couples
do
have
such
a
right
and
i
am
suggesting
that
the
real
issue
here
is
whether
that
fundamental
right
extends
outside
the
marital
context
into
other
unmarried
couples
who
form
bonds
and
have...
and...
for
whom
sexual
intimacy
plays
an
equally
important
role
in
their
lives.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
the
court
in...
has
moved
from
griswold
to
eisenstadt...
has
moved
in
the
contraception
area
outside
of
the
marital
context
to
the
unmarried
context,
certainly
the
right...
the
qualified
right
to
abortion
applies
to
unmarried
people,
as
well
as
married
people.
and
i
think
that
the
court
in...
in
looking
at
this
issue
of
the
scope
of
the
fundamental
right
to
make
choices
about
sexual
intimacy
ought
to
take
into
account
not
just
the
state
of
law
on
the
books
in
the
19th
century
but
a
couple
of
other
factors,
one
the
change
in
enforcement
in
the
last
50
years
because
the
court's
fundamental
rights
cases
all
do
look
at
current
laws,
as
well
as
19th
century
law
and
also
even
in
the
19th
century,
the
fact
that
there's
no
record
of
active
enforcement
of
these
laws
against
conduct...
of
adults
consensual
occurring
in
the
private
setting
and
that's
true
for
married
couples,
it's
true
for
different-sex
couples
who
weren't
married,
it's
true
for
same-sex
couples.
the
enforcement
of
the
sodomy
laws
of
this
country
going
back
to
the
founding
involves
coercion,
it
involves
children.
it
involves
public
activity.
it
doesn't
involve
the
kind
of
conduct
that's
at
issue
here.
so
you
really
have
a
tradition
of
respect
for
the
privacy
of
couples
in
their...
in
their
home,
going
back
to
the
founding
and
i
think
then
what
began
to
happen
in
1960
was
a
recognition
that
we
should
take
that
tradition
and...
and
turn
it
into
positive
law
on
the
books.
and
so
you
now
had
three
quarters
of
the
states
who
no
longer
regulate
this
conduct
for
anyone
based
on
a
recognition
that
it's
not
consistent
with
our
basic
american
values
about
the
relationship
between
the
individual
and
the
state.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
your
honor,
but
the
court's
decisions
don't
look
just
at
history,
they
look
at
the...
at
the
function
that
a
particular
claimed
freedom
plays
in
the
lives
of
real
people.
that's
why
contraception
became
an
issue.
that's
why
abortion
became
an
issue.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
court
has
said
that--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
court
has
said
that
it's
going
to
use
reasoned
judgment
to
identify
a
realm
of
personal
liberty
that
involves
matters
of
central
and
core
to
how
a
person
defines
their
own
lives,
and
relates
to
key
other
people.
it's
about
moral
upbringing
of
children
in
the
home.
it's
about
procreation
or
nonprocreation
in
your
sexual
relations
with
your
mate.
it's
about
basic
questions
of
what
kind
of
a
family
you're
going
to
live
with
and
other
intimate
associations.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
they
certainly
involved
the
right
to
decide
to
engage
in
sexual
relations
with...
while
preventing
procreation,
that's
what...
that's
what
griswold
and
eisenstadt
and
carey
all
say
you
have
a
right
to
do.
that
there's
a
right
to
decide
whether
to
bear
and
beget
children
and
then
that
right
resides
with
unmarried
people
as
much
as
it
resides
with
married
people.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
it's
illogical,
fundamentally
illogical
to
say
that
an
unmarried
couple
has
a
right
free
of
state
intrusion
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
have
procreative
sex
or
nonprocreative
sex,
but
doesn't
have
the
right
to
be
free
from
state
intrusion...
free
from
a
law
that
says
you
can't
have
any
sexual
intimacy
at
all.
there's
a...
there's
a
jagged
piece
missing
from
the
edifice
of
this
court's
substantive
fundamental
rights
jurisprudence.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
this
particular
law
does
that,
yes,
your
honor,
but
certainly
our...
our
submission
is
that
fornication
laws
and...
and
laws
involving
sodomy
regulation
more
broadly
would
be
equally
unconstitutional,
because
they
involve--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--right.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
first
of
all
that
the
positive
law,
the
law
on
the
books
proves
too
much
because
it
intruded
right
into
the
marital
bedroom
and
that
the
record
of
enforcement
which
may
be
more
informative
actually
supports
us
rather
than
supporting
the
notion
that
this
is
something
that
can
be
regulated.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
evidence
we
have
is
the...
is
the
absence
of
reported
cases
discussing
arrests
for
that
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
certainly
it
seems
to
us
there's
a
significance
to
the
fact
that
it
has
never
been
treated
as,
for
example,
drug
use
in
the
home
has
been
treated.
and
people
do...
the
police
obviously
do
actively
seek
to
infiltrate
homes
to
find
that
kind
of
activity,
it's
been
treated
in
a
categorically
different
way.
but
perhaps--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
argument
about
19th
century
enforcement
is
that
they
didn't
prosecute
anyone
for
private
and
consensual
crimes
involving
adults,
that
they
worried
about
children,
they
worried
about
public
activity,
they
worried
about
coercion,
but
that
they
didn't
worry
about
same-sex
or
different-sex
sodomy.
now
as
to
the
equal
protection
point
which
i
think
i
should
get
to
in
my
remaining
time.
this
is
a
statute
which
in
addition
to
intruding
into
that
area
of
important
fundamental
protections,
limits
its
focus
just
to
one
small
minority
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
texas.
it
says
that
these
specified
forms
of
sexual
intimacy
called
deviate
sexual
intercourse
are
illegal
only
for
same-sex
couples
and
not
for
anyone
else
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
i
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional
under
my
first
point,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
think
there
is
a
multiple...
multiply
unconstitutional
statute,
because
it
does
the
second
thing
as
well,
it
says
that--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--if
there
was
a
record
of
enforcement
almost
exclusively
as
to
same-sex
couples,
i
think
there
would
be
potential
constitutional
problems
there,
but
the
statutory
language
itself
would
not
involve
an
equal
protection
problem
of
the
same
sort
that
we're
dealing
with
here.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
don't
know
whether
statutes
actually
are
written
that
way,
your
honor.
the
point
i
would
make
is
that
when
a
statute--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that
may
be
as
well.
i
think--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
didn't
suggest
that
they're
unconstitutional.
my
point
is
that
when
a
statute
is
limited
to
one
particular
group
of
people,
particularly
a
minority
of
people
in
the
state,
that
that
limitation
itself
has
to
be
justified
under
equal
protection,
that
that's
a
classification
of
people,
not
merely
a
definition
of
conduct.
and
that
if
the...
if
the
justification
of
the
line
that
was
drawn
here
is...
is
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
mere
rationale
basis
analysis.
because--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
it
would
have
to
be
justified
by
the
state.
they
may
well
come
in
with
evidence
that
this
is
not
a
problem
that
needs
to
be
addressed
or
that
the
victims
are
more
able
to
protect
themselves,
they
may
have...
they
may
have--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
the
one
thing
that
i
submit,
the
court,
the
state
should
not
be
able
to
come
in
to
say
is
we
are
going
to
permit
ourselves
the
majority
of
people
in
our
society
full...
full
and
free
rein
to
make
these
decisions
for
ourselves
but
there's
one
minority
of
people
don't
get
that
decision
and
the
only
reason
we're
going
to
give
you
is
we
want
it
that
way.
we
want
them
to
be
unequal
in
their
choices
and
their
freedoms,
because
we
think
we
should
have
the
right
to
commit
adultery,
to
commit
fornication,
to
commit
sodomy
and
the
state
should
have
no
basis
for
intruding
into
our
lives
but
we
don't
want
those
people
over
there
to
have
the
same
right.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
first
of
all,
the
first
law
that's
appeared
on
the
books
in
the
states
of
this
country
that
singles
out
only
same
sex
sodomy
appeared
in
the
'60s
and
the
'70s
and
it
did
not...
and
it
does
not
go
way
back,
this
kind
of
discrimination.
now,
bigamy
involves
protection
of
an
institution
that
the
state
creates
for
its
own
purposes
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
potential
justifications
about
the
need
to
protect
the
institution
of
marriage
that
are
different
in
kind
from
the
justifications
that
could
be
offered
here
involving
merely
a
criminal
statute
that
says
we're
going
to
regulate
these
peoples
behaviors,
we
include
a
criminal
law
which
is
where
the
most
heightened
form
of...
of
people
protection
analysis
ought
to
apply.
this
case
is
very
much
like
mclaughlin,
your
honor,
where
you
have
a
statute
that
said
we're
going
to
give
an
specially
heightened
penalty
to
cohabitation,
but
only
when
it
involves
a
white
person
with
a
black
person.
that
interracial
cohabitation
is
different,
and
the
state
there
made
the
argument
we're
merely
regulating
a
particular
form
of
conduct,
and
that's
a
different
form
of
conduct
than...
than
intro
racial
cohabitation.
and
this
court
very
clearly
said
no.
you're
classifying
people.
and
that
classification
has
to
be
justified.
and
this
court
at
many
times
said
a
merely
disapproval
of
one
group
of
people,
whether
it
be
the
hippie
communes
in
moreno
or
the
mentally
retarded
in
cleburne,
or
indeed
gay
people.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
and
what
this
court
does
under
the
equal
protection
clause
is...
is...
standard
as
a
bull
work
against
arbitrary
government
when
the...
when
there
is
no
rational
justification
for
the
line
that
is
drawn.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
we
certainly
do
not
think
we
do,
your
honor.
we
think
this
fails
rational
basis
scrutiny,
just
as
the
law
did
in
romer,
in
cleburne,
in
moreno,
in
eisenstadt,
all
of
those
laws
were
thrown
out
under
rational
basis
scrutiny,
because
the
state
basically
didn't
come
up
with
anything
other
than
we
want
it
that
way.
we
want
these
people
to
be
excluded.
we'd
had
distaste
for
them.
we
disapprove
of
them.
it's
mere
disapproval,
or
hostility,
however
historically
based,
is
not
sufficient.
and
certainly
even
applying
the
rational
basis--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
certainly
bowers
is
not
an
equal
protection
case
and
it
didn't
involve
this
kind
of
discrimination.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no
i
was
still
talking
about
the
level
of
scrutiny
under
equal
protection,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it's
hard
when
you
have
these
two
points
to
shift
back
and
forth.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
three
weeks
ago,
yes,
your
honor.
the...
but
the
court
in
applying
even
the
rational
basis
standard
has
not
been
insensitive
to
the
reality
of
what
the
world
is
like,
and
to
the
fact
that
some
groups
of...
some
classifications
tend
to
be
involving
minorities
that
have
had
histories
of
discrimination
against
them
and
that
the
overall
effect
of
some
line-drawing
can
be
very
harmful.
in
romer
itself,
the
court
looked
at
the
actual
effects
of
the...
of
the
amendment
in
the
constitution
and
all
of
the
many
ways
in
which
it
caused
harm.
here
you
have
a
statute
that
while
it...
while
it
purports
to
just
to
regulate
sexual
behavior,
has
all
sorts
of
collateral
effects
on
people.
people
in
the
states
who
still
regulate
sodomy
everyday
they're
denied
visitation
to
their
own
children,
they're
denied
custody
of
children,
they're
denied
public
employment.
they're
denied
private
employment,
because
they're
labeled
as
criminals
merely
because
they've
been
identified
as
homosexuals.
and
that
we
submit--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
the
issue
of...
of
preference
in
the
educational
context
would
involve
very
different
criteria,
your
honor,
very
different
considerations,
the
state
would
have
to
come
in
with
some
sort
of
a
justification.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
i
think
it
would
be
high...
high
problematic,
such
a
custody
case.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
if
that
were
the
only
justification
that
could
be
offered,
there
was
no
some
showing
that
there
would
be
any
more
concrete
harm
to
the
children
in
the
school.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
i...
i
think
the
state
has
to
have
a
greater
justification
for
its
discrimination
than
we
prefer
pushing
people
towards
heterosexuality.
that
amounts
to
the
same
thing
as
disapproval
of
people's
choices
in
this
area
and
there
has
to
be
a
more...
more
reasons
and
justifiable
distinction
than
simply
we
prefer
this
group
of
people,
the
majority,
instead
of
this
group
of
people,
the
minority.
justice
jackson
in
the
railway
express
case
said
very
eloquently
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
an
important
bull
work
against
arbitrary
government
because
it's
there
to
make
sure
that
legislators
don't
avoid
political
retribution
by
imposing
onerous
burdens
only
on
one
minority,
but
that
in
fact
the
majority
will
live
by
the
same
rules
as
purports
to
impose
on
everybody
else.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
we're
asking
you
to
overrule
it
and
we
think
that
the
right
of...
of
the
fundamental
right
of
unmarried
people
to
make
these
choices
about
private
adult
consensual
intimacy
applies
to
different
sex
couples
as
well
as
same
sex
couples
and
that
bowers
was
wrong
for
essentially
three
reasons,
first
it
posed
the
question
too
narrowly
by
focusing
just
on
homosexual
sodomy,
which
is
just
one
of
the
moral
choices
that
couples
ought
to
have...
that
people
ought
to
have
available
to
them.
and
second
in
its
analysis
of
history,
which
i
think
i
explained
already
and
third,
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
in
the
assumptions
that
the
court
made
in
1986
about
the
realities
of
gay
lives
and
gay
relationships,
the
court
simply
asserted
in
the
bowers
case
that
there's
no
showing
that
has
been
demonstrated
between
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
this
conduct
and
family.
and
certainly
while
it
may
not
have
been
shown
in
that
case
or
even
apparent
to
the
court
this
1986,
i
submit
it
has
to
be
apparent
to
the
court
now
that
there
are
gay
families
that
family
relationships
are
established,
that
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
registered
in
the
census
in
the
2000
census
who
have
formed
gay
families,
gay
partnerships,
many
of
them
raising
children
and
that
for
those
people,
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
sexual
expression
as
they
will
in
the
privacy
of
their
own
homes
performs
much
the
same
function
that
it
does
in
the
marital
context,
that
you
can't
protect
one
without
the
other,
that
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
draw
a
line
there
and
that
you
should
protect
it
for
everyone.
that
this
is
a
fundamental
matter
of
american
values.
so
those
are
the
three
reasons
we
ask
you
to
overrule
bowers
v.
hardwick
as
to
the
fundamental
rights
aspect
of
the
case
and
that
we
think
that
that
is
an
area
where
the
court
should
go...
should
go
back
and
reconsider
itself.
the
court
has
now
left
open
for
nearly
30
years
the
question
of
whether
anybody
outside
has
a
right...
has
a
privacy
right
to
engage
in
consensual
sexual
intimacy
in
the
privacy
of
their
home.
and
i
submit
to
you,
you
know,
while
the
court
has
left
that
unanswered,
the
american
people
have
moved
on
to
the
point
where
that
right
is
taken
for
granted
for
everyone.
most
americans
would
be
shocked
to
find
out
that
their
decision
to
engage
in
sexual
intimacy
with
another
person
in
their
own
home
might
lead
to
a
knock
on
the
door
as
occurred
here
and
a
criminal
prosecution.
and
that...
that
reality
is
something
that
the
court
needs
into
account
and
certainly
in
so
doing,
it
shouldn't...
in
constructing
its
fundamental
rights
edifice
draw
distinctions
between
gay
couples
and
other
couples.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
think
that
the
state
has--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--your
honor,
adultery
is
a
very
different
case.
it
involves
the
state
interests
in
protecting
the
marital
contract
which
people
voluntarily
take
on.
and...
and
so
in
assessing.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
sure,
the
state
is--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
i
can
understand
a
law
which
says
we're
going
to
attempt
to
channel
heterosexuals
towards
marriage
by
making
them...
making
it
illegal
for
them
to
have
sex
without
marriage.
i
can't
understand
that
law
under...
under
that
kind
of
rational
which
only
regulates
same
sex
couples
and
says
you
can't
have
sex
but
everyone
else
has
a
right
to
do
that.
as
for
adultery
and
all
of
the
other
parade
of
horribles
which
people
have
raised
in
their
briefs,
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
to
look
at
the
individual
interests
and
the
state
interests
and
their
dramatically
different
in
all
of
those
cases
incest,
prostitution,
all
of
these...
bestiality,
all
of
these
things
either
there's
very
little
individual
interests
or
there's
very
heightened
state
interest
or
both,
in
all
of
those
cases,
so
the
idea
that
by
recognizing
the
right
of
all
adult
couples
to
make
choices
like
this
in
their
own
home
the
court
is
going
to
open
up
a
whole
can
of
worms,
i
submit,
is
correct.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
have
a
couple
of
points
to
make.
i
thought
i
might
address
this
question
of
what
it
was
that
we
proved
in
the
record
below
and
whether
or
not
we
have,
as
a
result,
adequately
teed
up
the
issues
before
the
court
without
having
put
into
evidence
directly
that
this
was
a
noncoercive
act
or
a
noncommercial
act
or
a
nonpublic
act
or
things
of
that
kind.
our
position
is
that
this
is
a
criminal
statute
that
has
only
two
elements,
it
has
a
list
of
particular
kinds
of
sexual
intimacy
that
you're
not
allowed
to
engage
in
and
it
they
have
to
prove
as
well
that
the
two
people
involved
were
of
the
same
sex.
there
was
a
complaint
that
was
filed
that
listed
those
two
elements.
my
clients
pleaded
no
contest
to
those
two
elements
but
said
that
there
is
an
insufficient
basis
for
imposing
criminal
liability
on
them,
because,
first
of
all,
they
invade
fundamental
rights
and
second
of
all,
because
the
law
is
discriminatory,
while
it's
supposedly
got
a
moral
basis,
it's
a
discriminatory
morality,
a
morality
imposed
only
on
one
category
of
couples
in
a
state
which
does
not
penalize
in
any
way
adultery,
fornication
or
sodomy
for
people
of...
of
couples
that
are
different
sex.
those
are
the
arguments
that
were
made
and...
so
our
position
is
that
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
both
facially
and
as
applied
here,
because
the
state
purports
to
impose
liability
based
on
those
two
elements
alone
and
that
they
are
constitutionally
insufficient
bases
both
for
fundamental
rights
reasons
and
because
it's
a
discriminatory
state.
the
other
point
i
thought
i
might
just
address
for
the
moment
is
the
public
health
rationale
which
didn't
come
up
before.
essentially,
what
the
facts
are...
and
i
think
this
comes
out
to
a
large
extent,
it's
undisputed
in
the
amicus
briefing...
the
issue
is
not
briefed
in
here
because
the
texas
brief
doesn't
even
attempt
to
make
this
argument,
but
it
is...
the
facts
are
that
if
this
was
the
line
between
safe
and
unsafe
forms
of
sexual
intimacy
it's
as
if
the
law
cuts
right
across
it.
regulating
some
of
the
most
safe
forms
of
sexual
activity
possible,
including,
for
example,
lots
of
safe
sex...
same-sex
activity
involving
women
and
leaving
completely
unregulated
all
sorts
of
forms
of
unsafe
sexual
activity
involving
different
sex
couples.
so
if
there
was
ever
a
case
of
a
law
where
the
fit
is
egregiously
improper
and
insufficient
to
justify
the
law
under
the
rational
basis
test,
this
would
be
such
a
case.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
