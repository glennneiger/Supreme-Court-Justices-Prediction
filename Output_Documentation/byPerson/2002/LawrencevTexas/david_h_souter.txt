justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
even
if
you
take
the
narrowest
view
of
glucksberg
and
even
if
you
say
there's
got
to
be
a
positive
historical
sanction,
that
in
fact
there
is
no
historical...
no
substantial
historical
evidence
to
the
contrary
because,
a,
the...
the
sodomy
laws
were
not
enforced
against
consensual
activity
historically
and
b,
they
were
not
aimed
at
homosexual
as
opposed
to
sodomy
in
general?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that...
your
historical
point,
you
say
even
if
i
accept
your
argument,
i
should
win?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
even
have
to
get
to
the...
as
i
understand
it,
you
don't
even
have
to
get
to
the
characterization
of
homosexual.
the
statute
clearly
defines
certain
acts
committed
by
or
together
with
individuals
of
the
same
sex
and
that's
your
class,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
more
do
we
need?
justice
david
h.
souter
when...
when
did
texas
select
homosexual
sodomy
as...
as
a
subject
of
specific
criminal
prohibition?
justice
david
h.
souter
my
question--
justice
david
h.
souter
--go
ahead,
but
my
question
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
about
sodomy
among
two
adults
of
the
same
sex?
justice
david
h.
souter
when...
when
was...
was
the
first
statute
passed?
i
think
200
years
was
mentioned.
was
there
a
law
in
the
books
in
1803?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
have
to
be...
it
doesn't
have
to--
--territorial--
justice
david
h.
souter
1803
or
the
first
date
of
the
texas
legislature's
meeting,
did
they
pass
it
at
the...
at
the
first
meeting
of
the
legislature?
justice
david
h.
souter
when
did...
when
did
they
single
out
homosexual
sodomy?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
issue
here
doesn't
have
much
of
a
longstanding
tradition
specific
to
this
statute,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the...
mr.
rosenthal,
isn't
the
thrust
of
justice
breyer's
question
that
when...
when
the
state
criminalizes
behavior
as
immoral,
customarily
what
it
points
to
is
not
simply
an
isolated
moral
judgment
or
the
moral
judgment
alone,
but
it
points
to
a
moral
judgment
which
is
backed
up
by
some
demonstration
of
harm
to
other
people.
we...
we've
heard
questions
for
example
about
harm
to
a...
a
marital
institution.
it
makes
sense
to
say
whether
you
think
the
law
is
enforceable
or
not.
it
makes
sense
to
say
that
adultery
threatens
the...
the
durability
of
a
particular
instance
of
marriage.
on
the
instance
of
marriage.
what
kind
of
harm
to
others
can
you
point
to
in
this
case
to
take
it
out
of
the
category
of
simple
moral
disapproval,
per
se?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
point
to
a
kind
of
harm
here
to
an
individual
or
to
the
individual's
partner,
which
is
comparable
to
the
harm
that
results
from
the...
the
harm
to
the
deterioration
of
the
body
and
the
mind
from
drug-taking?
i
mean,
i
don't
see
the
parallel
between
the
two
situations.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
not
the
state's
claim
in
any
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
you
read...
i
don't
know...
i
can't
remember
now
who
filed
it,
but
there
was
one
medical
brief
filed
on
that
subject
and
the
argument
there
was
that,
in
fact,
these
laws
are...
are
directly
antithetical
to
health
claim.
do
you...
do
you
have
any
comment
to
make
on
that
brief?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
issue
was
open,
so
far
as...
as
we're
concerned
that
that
would
be
your
position,
i
take
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
that's
the
reason
for
it,
why
doesn't
texas
prohibit
the
conduct
in
a
heterosexual
relationship?
i
mean,
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
harm
because
if
there
were
a
harm,
beyond
moral
disapproval,
the
law
would
not
be
restricted
to
homosexuals.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
not
prohibited?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
