mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
give
me
just
a
moment.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
humbly
submits
that
enforcement
of
texas
penal
code
statute
21.06
does
not
violate
the
14th
amendment
of
the
constitution
because
this
court
has
never
recognized
a
fundamental
right
to
engage
in
extramarital
sexual
conduct
and
because
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
the
statute
sufficient
to
withstand
equal
protection
scrutiny.
i'd
like
to
begin
with
a
brief
discussion
of
substantive
due
process.
from
a
practitioner's
standpoint,
it
appears
that
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
appears
to
resolve
the
means
by
which
the
court
entertains
a
claim
of
novel
protected
liberty
interests.
since
the
constitution
does
not
expressly
address
the
issue
of
privacy
or
of
sexual
conduct,
we
look
to
the
court's
precedents
and
to
the
history
of
our
people.
if
a
historical,
traditional
analysis
applies,
it
then
serves
as
objective
guideposts
to
guide
this
court,
as
long
as
those
ideals
and
laws
do
not
infringe
on
fundamental
rights.
the
court
has
maintained
that
designation
of
a
liberty
interest
is
done...
not
done
with
impunity.
but
only
those
interests
that
appear
to
be
carefully
identified
asserted
rights
should
be
drawn
and
should
be
considered
as
liberty
interests.
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
particularly
show
which
rights
the
petitioners
are
asking
to
uphold.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
no,
sir,
they're...
they're
asking
for
the
right
of
homosexuals
to
engage
in
homosexual
conduct.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
these
people
are
homosexuals.
they're
not
homosexuals
by
definition
if
they
commit
one
act.
it's
our
position
that
a
heterosexual
person
can
also
violate
this
code
if
they
commit
an
act
of
deviate
sexual
intercourse
with
another
of
the
same
sex.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
the
difference
it
makes
is
as
the...
as
the
record
is
set
out,
it
does
not
really
define
the
issues
such
that
the
court
can
actually
give
the
petitioners
a...
a
specific
form
of
relief.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
we're...
the
class
actually
is
people
who
violate
the
act,
not
classes
of
individuals
based
upon
sexual
orientation.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
of
course
we...
we
believe
that
bowers
versus
hardwick
is...
is
good
law.
it's
substantial
law
and
that
this
court
should
not
overrule
bowers--
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
and
it's
our
position
that
bowers
versus
hardwick
is
still
good
law,
that
there's
nothing
that's
changed
about
the
fundamental
liberties
or
the...
or
the
history
or
traditions
of
our
country
that
should
make
the
analysis
in
bowers
incorrect
any
longer.
the
petitioner
also
claims
that
the
mores
of
our
nation
have
changed
to
the
point
where
physical
homosexual
intimacy
is
now
part
of
the
fabric
of
american
values.
and
it's
our
position
this
cannot
be
correct.
even
if
you
infer
that
various
states
acting
through
their
legislative
process
have
repealed
sodomy
laws,
there
is
no
protected
right
to
engage
in
extrasexual...
extramarital
sexual
relations,
again,
that
can
trace
their
roots
to
history
or
the
traditions
of
this
nation.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
history...
tradition
does
not
matter
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
it...
it
can
be
a
protected
liberty
interest.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
the
public
perception
of
it?
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
of
homosexuals,
but
not
of
homosexuality
activity.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
even--
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
--sure.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and...
and
in
addition,
what
i
was
trying
to
say
by
the
fact
that
various
states
have
changed
their
position
on
sodomy,
they've
done
it
through
the
legislative
process.
and
that's
where
we
believe
this
belongs,
is
in
the
state
house
of
texas,
not
this
court.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
goes
back
to
whether
the...
where...
whether
people
in
texas
and
people
in
the
other
states
that
had
this
law
on
their
books
actually
accepted
through
their
representative
government.
i
think
it
comes
down
to
the...
the
actual
people
who...
who
determine
the
consensus
and
mores
of
the
state
or
the...
or
the
elected
legislators.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
certainly.
and
just
because
someone
has
decriminalized
sodomy
doesn't
mean
that
they
embraced
that
practice
as
something
that
ought
to
be
taught
in
the
schools
as
was
mentioned
before.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
all
right--
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
--okay.
first
of
all,
let
me...
let
me
correct
something
that...
that's
very
minor
at
this
point,
but
the
allegation
was
made
in
petitioners'
argument
that
people
can...
convicted
of
homosexual
conduct
are
banned
from
jobs
and
housing
and
all...
and
all
that
kind
of
thing.
in
texas,
homosexual
conduct
is
a
class
c
misdemeanor.
that
is,
it
is
the
lowest
misdemeanor...
or
the
lowest
prohibition
that
texas
has.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
it's
our
position
that
the
line
should
be
drawn
at
the
marital
bedroom,
through
which
we
can...
through
the
law
enforcement
or
anyone
else
cannot
pass
unless
something
illegal
happens
inside
that
bedroom.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
you're
right
about
that,
but--
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
--first
of
all,
let
me
say--
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
--first
of
all,
let
me
say
that
consent
may
alleged
in
this
case,
but
consent
is
not
proven
in
the
record
in
this
case.
there's...
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that
people
are
capable
of
giving
consent
or
that
consent
was,
in
fact,
given,
but
even
given
that,
i...
i
think
that
the...
that
this
court
having
determined
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
conduct
that
it
will
accept
and
certain
kinds
of
conduct
it
will
not
accept
may
draw
the
line
at
the
bedroom
door
of
the
heterosexual
married
couple
because
of
the
interest
that
this
court
has
that
this
nation
has
and
certainly
that
the
state
of
texas
has
for
the
preservation
of
marriage,
families
and
the
procreation
of
children.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
i
do
not
know
what
that
texas
law...
what
the
texas
law
says
in
that
regard.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
again,
your
honor,
we're
not
saying
that
they
can't
be
proper
guardians
and
we
can't
say
that
they
can't
raise
children.
that...
that's
not
the
issue.
the
issue--
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
--we
are
sure
that
they...
that
they
can't
do
that.
but
we're
also
not...
not
penalizing
their...
their
status.
we're
penalizing
only
the
particular
activity
that
those
unmarried
couples
may
have
with
respect
to
whether
they
have
sexual
intimacies.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
it
used
to.
it
does
not
do
that
now,
unless
the
sexual
intimacy
is
in
public
or
where
someone
might
view--
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
--it
does
not
criminalize
it,
it
does
not
condone
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
again,
adultery
is
not
penalized
in
texas,
but
it
is
certainly
not
condoned
in
texas.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
i
think
what...
what
i'm
saying
is...
and
i
had
not
gotten
into
the
equal
protection
aspect
of
the...
of
the
argument
yet,
but
under
the
equal
protection
argument,
texas
has
the
right
to
set
moral
standards
and
can
set
bright
line
moral
standards
for
its
people.
and
in
the
setting
of
those
moral
standards,
i
believe
that
they
can
say
that
certain
kinds
of
activity
can
exist
and
certain
kinds
of
activity
cannot
exist.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
they
can
make
that
a
law,
but
there
would
be
no
rational
basis
for
the
law.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
again,
if...
if
texas
did
pass
the
law,
it
would
have
to...
have
to
show
through
some
rational
basis
test
that
it's
rationally
related
to
some
state
interest.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
certainly.
and
it
goes...
it
goes
to
things
as
diverse
as--
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
--oh,
certainly
not.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
but
it
also
violated
a
fundamental
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
the
fundamental
right
that
was
asserted
there
is...
is
a
long-established
fundamental
right
that
we
don't...
we
don't
treat
races
differently
because
we
think
that
one's
inferior
or
we
stereotype
someone--
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
--yes,
and
the
same
with...
with
the
case
that
was
cited
from
florida.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
sodomy
as
a...
as
a--
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
sodomy
had...
has
a
longstanding
tradition
of
the
history
of
texas
of
sodomy
being
against
the
law,
however--
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
texas
was
a
state
back
then.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
certainly
in
the...
in
the
1854
penal
code,
the...
the
kinds
of
activity
that...
that
were
classified
now
as
sodomy
were
against
the
law.
however,
i
think
to
address
your
question--
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
--in
1973,
in
the
passage
of
the
1974
penal
code.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
not
specific
to...
not
specific
to
that
statute,
but
it
has
a
longstanding
tradition
in
texas
as
being
something
that
should
be
proscribed
and
something
that
is
regarded
as
immoral
and
unwholesome.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
to
the...
to
the
time
that
texas
was
a
republic,
before
it--
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
--certainly
not.
but
it
would
have...
any
law
that
would
pass
would
have
to
have
some
rational
basis
to
the
state
interest.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
part
of
the...
part
of
the
rationale
for
the
law
is
to
discourage
similar
conduct,
that
is,
to
discourage
people
who
may
be
in
jail
together
or
want
to
experiment
from
doing
the
same
kind
of
thing
and
i
think...
and
i
think
that
the
state
can
do
that.
people
can
harm
themselves
and
still
be...
and
still
have
it
be
against
the
law.
but
they
can
take
drugs
and
do
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
not...
not
only
do
we
say
that
morality
is
a
basis
for
this,
but
of
course
the
antecedents
have
raised
that
there
may
also
be
health
considerations.
i
don't
know
whether
there
are
or
not.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
that's
not
the
state's
claim,
but
i
can't
say
that
it's
not
true.
obviously
this...
this
has--
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
there
was
a
law
filed
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
that
took
exactly
the
opposite
position.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
sir,
for
each
expert
there's
an
equal
and
opposite
expert.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
i
think
texas
has
the
right
to
prohibit
certain
conduct.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
because
heterosexual
conduct
is...
the
same
kinds
of
conduct...
and
by
the
way
it's
not
distinguished,
it's
still
called
deviate
sexual
intercourse
with
heterosexuals.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
but
it's
not
prohibited.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
but
it
also
can
lead
to
marriage
and
to
procreation.
and
that's...
and
that's
a
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
no,
but
i
think
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
the
state
can
make...
have...
can
have
preferences...
and
again
it
doesn't
say
that
simply
because
heterosexual
people
can...
can
have
deviate
sexual
intercourse,
the
state
approves
it.
there
are
just
simply
other
sanctions
that
the...
that
the
state
may
imply.
i
did
want
to
briefly
distinguish
this
case
from
your
decision
in
romer
v.
evans.
and
obviously
the
distinction
there
was...
was
that
the
colorado
amendment
sought
to
classify
people
based
on
their
orientation
and
not
their
conduct.
and
by
so
doing,
they
excluded
a
certain
class
of
people
from
the
political
debate.
now,
on
the
contrary,
texas
welcomes
all
into
the
political
debate
and...
in
the
last
texas
legislature,
fortunately
our
legislature
meets
only
every
other
year,
but
in
the
last
texas
legislature,
there
was
a
hate
crime
statute
passed
which
made
it
a
more
heinous
crime
to
make
someone
a
victim
of
crime
based
upon
their
sexual
orientation
and
it
included
all
sexual
orientations.
it
included
homosexuals,
bisexuals
and
heterosexuals,
all,
so
i
don't
think
we
can
say
across
the
board
that
there's
some
sort
of
texas
policy
that
we're
trying
to
overall
discriminate
against...
against
homosexuals
as
a
group.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
true,
if
it
weren't
that
the
historical
fact
that
that's
not
in
fact
true.
that
there
have
been
people
who
have
campaigned
in
texas
and
have
admitted
their
homosexuality
and
have
been
elected
to
office.
mr.
charles
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
no,
ma'am,
they
can't
be
charged
as
law-breakers
for
having
that
orientation.
they
can
only
be
charged
as
law-breakers
if
they
commit
that
particular
act.
and
then,
again,
the
state
does
not
allow
any
disabilities
to
come
from
class
c
misdemeanor
acts.
i'm
sure
it's
obvious
to
this
court
that
the
issues
of
homosexual
rights
are
highly
emotional
for
the
petitioner
in
these
quarters
but
equally
anxious
in
this
court's...
for
this
court's
decision
are
those
who
are,
number
one,
concerned
with
the
rights
of
states
to
determine
their
own
destiny,
and,
two,
and
possibly
more
important,
those
persons
who
are
concerned
that
the
invalidation
of
this
little
texas
statute
would
make...
would
make
marriage
law
subject
to
constitutional
challenge.
then
again,
how
far
behind
that
can
there
be
other
acts
of
sexual
gratification
brought
for
constitutional
challenge
also.
there's
already
movements
to
lower
the
age
limit
of
consent
for
children
engaged
in
sexual
practices.
and
there
are
secondary
effects,
particularly
in
texas
law,
where
we
are
a
common
law
state
and
the
common
law
is
based
upon
community
property
shared
by
both
spouses.
the
state
of
texas
is
asking
this
court
to
be
mindful
of
the
far-reaching
aspects
of
your
decision
in
this
case,
so
as
not
to
disenfranchise
23
million
texans
who
ought
to
have
the
right
to
participate
in
questions
having
to
do
with
moral
issues.
we
ask
you
to
affirm
the
texas
court
of
appeals.
