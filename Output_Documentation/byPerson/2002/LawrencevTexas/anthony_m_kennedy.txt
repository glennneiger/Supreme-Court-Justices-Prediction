well,
if
the
statute
covered
both,
would
there
be
an
equal
protection
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
can
see
that
your
point
may
have
some
relevance
on
the
equal
protection
side
of
the
equation,
some
relevance,
i
don't
think
it
may
be
controlling.
it...
it
doesn't
seem
to
meet
the
arguments
that's
made
under
the
substantive
liberty
part
of
the
argument
with
reference
to
bowers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
doesn't
meet
the
petitioners'
argument
with
respect
to
bowers
versus
hardwick,
which
they
say
should
be
overruled.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
question
is
certainly
clearly
before
us.
i
mean
this
is
your
statute.
you
convicted
the
people
for
these
acts
and
you
have
to
be...
you
have
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
question
before
the
court
is
the
validity
of
a
texas
statute
making
it
a
crime
for
two
persons
of
the
same
sex
to
engage
in
certain
intimate
sexual
conduct.
in
houston,
texas,
police
officers
were
dispatched
to
a
private
residence
in
response
to
a
reported
weapons
disturbance.
the
right
of
the
police
to
enter
does
not
seem
to
have
been
questioned
at
any
stage
in
the
case.
now,
the
police
entered
the
apartment
where
one
of
the
petitioners,
joseph
geddes
lawrence
resided.
the
officers
observed
lawrence
and
other
man,
tyron
garner
engaging
in
a
sexual
act.
garner
is
also
one
of
the
petitioners
here.
lawrence
and
garner
were
arrested,
held
in
custody
overnight,
and
charged
under
the
texas
criminal
statute.
the
statute
punishes
certain
sexual
conduct
when
committed
by
persons
of
the
same
sex.
the
petitioners
were
convicted
and
they
challenged
their
convictions
under
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
constitution.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
texas
fourteenth
district
affirmed
the
conviction.
they
had
an
en
banc
hearing
and
it
was
a
divided
court.
the
majority
in
the
state
court
considered
bowers
versus
hardwick,
the
decision
issued
by
our
court
in
1986
to
control
the
federal
due
process
aspect
of
this
dispute.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
the
constitutional
claims
presented
including
the
question
whether
bowers
versus
hardwick
should
be
overruled.
we
conclude
this
case
shoed
be
resolved
by
determining
whether
the
petitioners
were
free
as
adults
to
engage
in
this
private
conduct
in
the
exercise
of
their
liberty
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
for
this
inquiry,
we
deem
it
necessary
to
revisit
this
court’s
holding
in
bowers.
bowers
versus
hardwick
had
some
factual
similarities
to
this
case.
there
too,
a
police
officer
observed
the
petitioner
in
his
own
bedroom
engaging
in
intimate
sexual
conduct
with
another
man,
as
in
the
instant
case,
the
defendants
in
bowers
were
adults
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
offense
and
their
conduct
was
consensual.
the
bowers
court
rejected
the
petitioner’s
claims
under
the
due
process
clause.
the
bowers
court
began
its
discussion
as
follows:
it
said,
the
issue
presented
is
whether
the
federal
constitution
confers
a
fundamental
right
upon
homosexuals
to
engage
in
sodomy
and
hence,
invalidates
the
laws
of
the
many
states
that
still
make
such
conduct
illegal
and
have
done
so
for
a
very
long
time.
that
statement
in
our
view
discloses
bowers
failure
to
appreciate
the
extent
of
the
liberty
at
stake.
to
say
the
issue
in
bowers
was
simply
the
right
to
engage
in
certain
sexual
conduct
demeans
the
claim
put
forward,
just
as
it
would
demean
a
married
couple
or
to
be
said
that
marriage
is
simply
about
the
right
to
have
sexual
intercourse.
the
laws
involved
in
bowers
and
here
are
to
be
sure
statutes
that
do
prohibit
a
particular
sexual
act.
their
penalties
and
purposes
though
have
more
far-reaching
consequences
touching
upon
the
most
private
human
conducts,
sexual
behavior
and
in
the
most
private
of
places,
the
home.
the
statutes
seek
to
control
a
personal
relationship
that
is
within
the
liberty
of
persons
to
choose
without
being
punished
as
criminals.
now,
in
academic
writings,
some
of
which
are
referred
to
in
the
opinions
and
in
many
of
the
amicus
briefs
filed
in
this
case,
there
are
criticisms
of
the
historical
premises
that
were
relied
upon
by
the
majority
and
in
other
concurring
opinions
in
bowers.
we
need
not
enter
this
debate
to
reach
a
definitive
historical
judgment.
it
should
be
noted,
however,
that
there
is
no
long-standing
history
in
this
country
of
laws
directed
at
homosexual
conduct
as
a
distinct
matter.
laws
prohibiting
sodomy
do
not
seem
to
have
been
enforced
against
consenting
adults
acting
in
private.
a
substantial
number
of
prosecutions
for
which
there
are
records
were
for
predatory
acts
against
those
who
could
not
or
did
not
consent
as
in
the
case
of
a
minor.
the
history
relied
upon
in
bowers
is
more
complex
than
the
majority
and
concurring
opinions
in
that
case
indicate.
the
historical
premises
are
not
without
doubt.
at
the
very
least,
they
are
overstated.
now,
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
court
in
bowers
was
making
the
broader
point
that
for
centuries
there
have
been
powerful
voices
to
condemn
homosexual
conduct
as
immoral.
the
condemnation
has
been
shaped
by
religious
beliefs,
conceptions
of
right
and
acceptable
behavior,
and
respect
for
the
traditional
family.
to
many
persons,
these
are
not
trivial
concerns
but
profound
and
deep
convictions
accepted
as
ethical
and
moral
principles
to
which
they
aspire
and
which
thus
determine
the
course
of
their
lives.
these
considerations
do
not
answer
the
question
before
us
however.
the
issue
is
whether
the
majority
may
use
the
power
of
the
state
to
enforce
those
views
on
the
whole
society.
our
obligation
is
to
define
the
liberty
of
all,
not
to
mandate
our
own
moral
code.
in
all
events,
we
think
that
our
laws
and
traditions
in
the
past
half
century
are
of
most
relevance
here.
these
show
an
emerging
awareness
that
liberty
gives
substantial
protection
to
adult
persons
in
deciding
how
to
conduct
their
private
lives
in
matters
pertaining
to
sex.
we
discuss
in
the
opinion
as
part
of
that
emerging
awareness,
the
legislative
determinations
in
some
of
the
states
to
repeal
laws
prohibiting
private
consensual
conduct
between
adults,
and
we
cite
the
same
policy
and
provisions
of
the
model
penal
code
promulgated
by
the
american
law
institute.
many
of
these
changes
already
had
taken
place
when
bowers
was
decided.
then
chief
justice
burger
was
one
of
the
five
justices
in
the
bowers
majority.
he
filed
a
separate
opinion
and
there
he
made
sweeping
references
to
the
history
of
western
civilization
and
to
christian
moral
and
ethical
standards.
that,
however,
did
not
take
account
of
authorities
pointing
in
an
opposite
direction
including
the
decision
of
the
european
court
of
human
rights
in
a
case
called
dudgeon
versus
unite
kingdom.
that
decision
with
facts
like
bowers
and
the
instnat
case
held
that
laws
prescribing
this
sort
of
conduct
are
invalid
under
the
european
convention
on
human
rights.
in
today’s
opinion,
we
discuss
some
of
the
cases
decided
before
bowers.
these
precedents
including
griswold
versus
connecticut,
eisenstadt
versus
baird,
roe
versus
wade,
and
carey
versus
population
services
all
limited
the
government’s
authority
to
enter
the
most
private
aspect
of
the
lives
of
individuals.
the
holding
of
bowers
is
inconsistent
with
the
teaching
of
these
cases.
two
principal
cases
decided
after
bowers
cast
this
holding
into
even
further
doubt.
these
are
planned
parenthood
versus
casey
and
romer
versus
evans.
romer
versus
evans
was
a
case
decided
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
there
may
be
a
tenable
argument
of
the
guarantee
of
equal
protection
renders
that
texas
statute
unconstitutional,
but
it
is
our
view
that
the
instant
case
requires
us
to
address
whether
bowers
itself
has
continuing
validity.
we
conclude
the
rational
of
bowers
does
not
withstand
careful
analysis.
bowers
was
not
correct
when
it
was
decided
and
it
is
not
correct
today.
it
ought
not
to
remain
binding
precedent.
bowers
versus
hardwick
should
be
and
now,
is
overruled.
the
present
case
does
not
involve
minors.
it
does
not
involve
persons
who
might
be
injured
or
coerced
or
who
were
situated
in
relationships
where
consent
might
not
easily
be
refused;
it
does
not
involve
public
conduct
or
prostitution;
it
does
not
involve
whether
the
government
must
give
formal
recognition
to
any
relationship
that
homosexual
persons
seek
to
enter.
the
case
does
involve
two
adults
who
with
full
and
mutual
consent
from
each
other
engaged
in
sexual
practices
common
to
a
homosexual
lifestyle.
the
petitioners
are
entitled
to
respect
for
their
private
lives.
the
state
cannot
demean
their
existence
or
control
their
destiny
by
making
their
private
sexual
conduct
a
crime.
their
right
to
liberty
under
the
due
process
clause
gives
them
the
full
right
to
engage
in
their
conduct
without
intervention
of
the
government.
it
is
the
promise
of
the
constitution
that
there
is
a
realm
of
personal
liberty
which
the
government
may
not
enter.
had
those
who
drew
and
ratified
the
due
processes
clauses
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
known
the
components
of
liberty
in
its
manifold
possibilities,
they
might
have
been
more
specific.
they
did
not
presume
to
have
this
insight.
they
knew
times
can
blind
us
to
certain
truths
and
later
generations
can
see
that
laws
once
thought
necessary
improper
in
fact,
serve
only
to
oppress.
as
the
constitution
endures,
persons
in
every
generation
can
invoke
its
principles
and
their
own
search
for
greater
freedom.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
texas
fourteenth
district
is
reversed.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
joined;
justice
thomas
has
also
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
