justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
getting
to
your
equal
protection
argument
now.
let's...
let's
separate
the
two.
the
first
is,
your...
your...
your
fundamental
right
argument,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
equal
protection?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
same-sex/other-sex
aspect
doesn't
come
into
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
may
well
be,
but
so
were
same-sex
couples.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
same-sex
couples
could
not...
could
not
perform
this
act
lawfully.
what
more
do
you
need
than
that?
it
was
prohibited.
when
you
go
beyond
that
and
say,
oh,
but
it
was
also
prohibited
for...
for
other
sex
couples,
you're
getting
into
an
equal
protection
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
not
a
fundamental
right
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
conceded
it.
i
haven't
conceded
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
our
basic
american
values,
to
revert
to
what
the
chief
justice
was
suggesting
earlier.
really
what's
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
we're
going
to
adhere
to...
in
the
first
part
of
the
case,
not
the
equal
protection
aspect.
it's
whether
we're
going
to
adhere
to
what...
what
we
said
in...
in
glucksberg,
mainly
that
before
we
find
a
substantive
due
process
right,
a
fundamental
liberty,
we
have
to
assure
ourselves
that
that
liberty
was
objectively
deeply
rooted
in
this
nation's
history
and
tradition.
that's
what
we
said
in
glucksberg
and
we've
said
it
in
other
cases.
or
are
we
going
to
depart
from
that
and
go
to
the
approach
that
we've
adopted
with
regard
to
the
eighth
amendment,
which
is
it
evolves
and
changes
in...
in
social
values
will
justify
a
new
perception
of
what
is
called
unusual
punishment.
now,
why
should
we...
why
should
we
slip
into
the
second
mode?
i'm...
i
mean,
suppose
all
the
states
had
laws
against
flagpole
sitting
at
one
time,
you
know,
there
was
a
time
when
it
was
a
popular
thing
and
probably
annoyed
a
lot
of
communities,
and
then
almost
all
of
them
repealed
those
laws.
does
that
make
flagpole
sitting
a
fundamental
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
the
function
it
plays
in
the
lives
of
real
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
law
stops
people
from
doing
what
they
really
want
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
you
can't
have...
you
can't
have
any
sexual
intimacy.
it
says
you
cannot
have
sexual
intimacy
with
a
person
of
the
same
sex.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
the
record
of
enforcement,
that
there
were...
that
what
happened
in
this
case
was
an
accidental
intrusion
of
the
police?
they
didn't
come
into
the
bedroom
looking
for
people
conducting
illicit
sexual
relations?
they
were
there
for
another
reason
and
happened
to
discover
these...
these
men
in
that
conduct.
what
do
you
mean
by
lack
of
enforcement?
the
police
have
not
gone
around
knocking
on
bedroom
doors
to
see
if
anyone...
i
mean...
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
crime
that
the
police
go
around
looking
for,
but
do
you
have
any
evidence
to
show
that
when
they...
when
they
found
it
being
committed,
they
turned
a
blind
eye
to
it
and
did
not
prosecute
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
because
it's...
it's
an
act
committed
in
private,
and...
and
the
police
respect
the
privacy
of...
of
one's
home,
of
one's
bedroom,
and
so
they
don't
investigate
and
find
it.
but
it
seems
to
me
what
you
would
need
is
evidence
that
when
the
police
discovered
this
matter,
they
said,
oh,
well,
these
are
not
laws
that
we
enforce.
i
don't
see
any
evidence
of
that
sort.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith,
aren't
there
a
lot
of
statutes
like
that?
aren't
there
statutes
in
many
states
about
adultery
that
don't
cover
sexual
relations
of
one
of
the
married
couple
with
someone
else
of
the
same
sex?
are
they
unconstitutional
because
of
denial
of
equal
protection?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
rape
laws?
there
are...
there
are
rape
laws
that...
that
only
apply
to...
to
male/female
rape.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that
they're
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
suppose
the
state
has
a
rape
law
that...
that,
you
know,
that
really
requires
the
penetration
of
the
female
sex
organ
by...
which
is
the
classic
common-law
definition
definition
of
rape,
and
it
has
no...
no
law
of...
about
homosexual
rape.
you
think
that
that
law
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
step
at
a
time?
this
is
more
common?
this
is...
or
this
is
something
that
we
find
more...
more...
more...
more
odious?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
you
you
can
put
it
that
way,
but
society
always...
in
a
lot
of
its
lives
makes
these
moral
judgments,
you
can
make
it
sound
very
puritanical,
the...
you
know,
the
laws...
the
laws
against
bigamy,
i
mean,
who
are
you
to
tell
me
that
i
can't
have
more
than
one
wife?
you
blue-nose
bigot.
sure.
you
can
make
it
sound
that
way,
but
these
are
laws
dealing
with
public
morality.
they've
always
been
on
the
book,
nobody
has
ever
told
them
they're
unconstitutional
simply
because
there
are
moral
perceptions
behind
them.
why
is
this
different
from
bigamy?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
said
the
opposite
in
bowers,
didn't
we?
overrule
bounds
essentially
on
that
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
equal
protection
and
on
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--maybe
you
ought
to
hold
up
one
hand
so
i'll
know
which?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
we
had
the
same
problem
in
the
last
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
a
justification
is
the
same
that's
alluded
to
here,
disapproval
of
homosexuality.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
it
would?
justice
antonin
scalia
only
that
the
children
might...
might
be
induced
to...
to
follow
the
path
of
homosexuality.
and
that
would
not
be...
that
would
the
not
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
probably
say
the
same
about
adultery,
you
think
adultery
laws
are
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
think
people
probably
feel
the
same
way
about
that,
you
know.
it
may
not
be
a
nice
thing
to
do,
but
i
certainly
don't
expect
a
knock
on
the
door
and
go
to
jail
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
the
marital
contract
important
to
the
state?
because
it's
the
source
of...
of
the
next
generation,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
there's
not
some
of
the
same
thinking
behind
the
conscious
choice
of
the
state
to
favor
heterosexual
and
marital
sex
over
homosexual
sex?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
that.
aren't
we
clear
what
right
they're
seeking
to
uphold?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
aren't...
why
aren't
they
seeking
to
vindicate
the
right
of
either
homosexuals
or
heterosexuals
to
commit
homosexual
act?
what
difference
does
that
make?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i...
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
get
that
argument.
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say...
you
were
responding
to
the
argument
that
the
morals
haven't
changed,
or
that
the
morals
have
changed
so
that
homosexuality
is
now
approved.
and
you
respond
to
that
by
saying
that
there's
no
tradition?
i
mean,
that's...
that's
a
totally
different
argument
from
tradition.
i
mean,
the...
the
argument
is
tradition
doesn't
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
do
you
think
that
the
public
perception
of...
of
homosexual
acts
has...
has
not
changed?
do
you
think
it
hasn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
yes.
do
you
think
there's
public
approval
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
base
that
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
base
that
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
i
think
there
ought
to
be
some
evidence
which...
which
you
can
bring
forward?
justice
antonin
scalia
like
perhaps
the
failure
of
the
federal
congress
to
add
the
sexual
preference
to
the
list
of
protected
statuses
against
which
private
individuals
are
not
permitted
to
discriminate,
that
addition
has
been
sought
several
times
and
it's
been
rejected
by
the
federal
congress,
hasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
thought
you
were
responding
to
the
argument
that
the
public
perception
hasn't
changed.
that
there
still
is...
is
a
public
disapproval
of
homosexual
acts.
and
you
can't
establish
that
by
saying
that
the
states
have
repealed
their
homosexual
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
might
there
be
a
difference
between
the
people's
willingness
to
prosecute
something
criminally
and
the
people's
embracing
of
that
as
a
fundamental
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
fairly
certain
that
they
can't
procreate
children,
aren't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
adultery?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
adultery?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rosenthal,
don't
you
think
that
what
laws
a
state
may
constitutionally
pass
has
a
lot
to
do
with
what
laws
it
has
always
been
thought
that
a
state
can
constitutionally
pass,
so
that
if
you
have
a
200-year
tradition
of
a
certain
type
of
law...
and
i
don't
know
of
a
200-year
tradition
of
laws
against
lying
at
the
dinner
table...
the
presumption
is
that
the
state
can
within
the
bounds
of...
of
the
constitution
to
pass
that
law
in...
as
declaring
what
it
has
proscribed
as
contra
bonos
mores,
a
term
that's
been
in
the
common
law
from
the
beginning
as
against
good
morals,
bigamy,
adultery,
all
sorts
of
things
like
that,
and
isn't
that
determined
pretty
much
on
the
basis
of
what
kind
of
laws
the
state
has
traditionally
been
allowed
to
pass?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
a
constitutional
text
there,
wasn't
there,
with
loving
versus
virginia.
i
thought
there
was
something
about
a
civil
war
and
no
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
a
trick
question,
mr.
rosenthal.
don't...
don't
fall
into
that
trap.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
homosexual
sodomy
was
unlawful
in
texas
from
when?
there
was
not
a
statute
addressed
just
to
that.
it
was
addressed
to
sodomy
in
general,
but
homosexual...
but
homosexual
sodomy
included,
and
that
law
goes
back
how
long?
to
1803?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
rational
basis
is
that
the
state
thinks
it
immoral
just
as
the
state
thinks
adultery
immoral
or
bigamy
immoral.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
my
dissenting
opinion
responds
to
the
particular
legal
points
made
by
the
court.
i
would
like
to
summarize
here
just
a
few
general
considerations.
the
texas
statute
at
issue
here,
undeniably
seeks
to
further
the
belief
of
its
citizens
that
certain
forms
of
sexual
behavior
are,
as
the
court
says,
“immoral
and
unacceptable”.
that
is
the
same
interest
furthered
by
criminal
laws
against
fornication,
bigamy,
adultery,
adult
incest,
bestiality,
and
obscenity.
bowers
held
that
this
was
a
legitimate
state
interest
preventing
sexual
behavior
that
the
society
believed
immoral
and
unacceptable.
the
court
today
reaches
the
opposite
conclusion.
it
embraces
instead
justice
stevens’
declaration
in
his
bowers
dissent
that
“the
fact
that
the
governing
majority
in
a
state
has
traditionally
viewed
a
particular
practice
as
immoral
is
not
a
sufficient
reason
for
upholding
a
law
prohibiting
the
practice”.
this
effectively
decrees
the
end
of
all
morals
legislation.
one
of
the
most
revealing
statements
in
today’s
opinion
is
the
court’s
warning
that
the
criminalization
of
homosexual
conduct
is
“an
invitation
to
subject
homosexual
persons
to
discrimination
both
in
the
public
and
in
the
private
spheres”.
it
is
clear
from
this
that
the
court
has
taken
sides
in
the
culture
war
and
in
particular,
in
that
battle
of
the
culture
war
that
concerns
whether
there
should
be
any
moral
opprobrium
attached
to
homosexual
conduct.
for
many
americans
do
not
want
persons
who
openly
engage
in
homosexual
conduct
to
be
partners
in
their
business,
scoutmasters
for
their
children,
teachers
in
their
children’s
schools,
or
boarders
in
their
home.
they
view
this
as
protecting
themselves
and
their
families
against
a
lifestyle
they
believe
to
be
immoral
and
destructive.
the
court,
however,
views
it
as
discrimination
which
it
is
the
function
of
our
judgments
to
deter.
so
imbued
is
the
court
with
the
law
profession’s
anti-anti-homosexual
culture
that
it
is
seemingly
unaware
that
the
attitudes
of
that
culture
are
not
obviously
mainstream,
that
in
most
states
what
the
court
calls
discrimination
against
those
who
engage
in
homosexual
acts
is
perfectly
legal,
that
proposals
to
ban
such
discrimination
under
title
vii
have
repeatedly
been
rejected
by
congress,
that
in
some
cases
such
discrimination
is
mandated
by
federal
statue
such
as
the
federal
statute
mandating
discharge
from
the
armed
forces
of
any
service
member
who
engages
or
intends
to
engage
in
homosexual
acts,
and
that
in
some
cases
such
discrimination
is
a
constitutional
right
as
we
have
held
with
regard
to
the
boy
scouts
of
america.
let
me
be
clear
that
i
have
nothing
against
homosexuals
or
any
other
group
promoting
their
agenda
through
normal
democratic
means.
social
perceptions
of
sexual
and
other
morality
change
over
time
and
every
group
has
the
right
to
persuade
its
fellow
citizens
that
its
view
of
such
matters
is
best,
that
homosexuals
have
achieved
some
success
in
that
enterprise
is
attested
to
by
the
fact
that
texas
is
one
of
the
few
remaining
states
that
criminalized
consensual
homosexual
acts,
but
persuading
ones
fellow
citizens
is
one
thing,
and
imposing
ones
views
in
absence
of
democratic
majority
will
is
something
else.
what
texas
has
chosen
to
do
is
well
within
the
range
of
traditional
democratic
action
and
its
hands
should
not
be
stayed
through
the
invention
of
a
brand
new
constitutional
right
by
a
court
that
is
impatient
of
democratic
change.
it
is
indeed
true
as
the
court’s
opinion
says
that
“later
generations
can
see
that
laws
once
thought
necessary
and
proper
in
fact
serve
only
to
oppress”,
and
when
that
happens,
later
generations
can
repeal
those
laws,
but
it
is
the
premise
of
our
system
that
those
judgments
are
to
be
made
by
the
people
and
not
imposed
by
a
governing
caste
that
knows
best.
one
of
the
benefits
of
leaving
regulation
of
this
matter
to
the
people
rather
than
to
the
courts
is
that
the
people,
unlike
judges
need
not
carry
things
to
their
logical
conclusion.
the
people
may
feel
for
example
that
their
disapproval
of
homosexual
conduct
is
strong
enough
to
disallow
homosexual
marriage
but
not
strong
enough
to
criminalize
private
homosexual
acts
and
they
can
legislate
accordingly.
the
court
today
pretends
that
it
possesses
a
similar
freedom
of
action
so
that
we
need
not
fear
judicial
imposition
of
homosexual
marriage
as
has
recently
occurred
in
canada.
at
the
end
of
its
opinion,
the
court
says
that
the
present
case
“does
not
involve
whether
the
government
must
give
formal
recognition
to
any
relationship
that
homosexual
persons
may
seek
to
enter”.
do
not
believe
it.
today’s
opinion
dismantles
the
structure
of
constitutional
law
that
has
permitted
a
distinction
to
be
made
between
heterosexual
and
homosexual
unions.
if
moral
disapprobation
of
homosexual
conduct
is
as
the
court
says
“no
legitimate
state
interest”,
and
if
as
the
court
says
casting
aside
all
pretense
at
neutrality
“when
sexuality
finds
overt
expression
in
intimate
conduct
with
another
person,
the
conduct
can
be
but
one
element
in
a
personal
bond
that
is
more
enduring”.
what
justification
could
there
possibly
be
for
denying
the
benefits
of
marriage
to
homosexual
couples
exercising
what
the
court
in
today’s
opinion
calls
“the
liberty
protected
by
the
constitution.”
one
can
believe
that
this
case
does
not
involve
the
issue
of
homosexual
marriage
only
if
one
thinks
that
principle
and
logic
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
decisions
of
this
court.
many
will
hope
that
as
the
court
comfortingly
assures
us,
that
is
so.
