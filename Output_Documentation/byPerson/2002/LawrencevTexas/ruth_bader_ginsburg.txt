were
you
talking
specifically
about
this
eisenstadt
against
baird
where
there
was
an
unmarried
couple...
while
there
was
an
unmarried
person
and
the
conduct
in
question
would
have
been
perhaps
in
the
19th
century,
early
19th
century,
criminal?
are
you
talking
about
fornication?
justice

mr.
smith
before
you
continue
down
to
the
equal
protection
line.
your
first
argument
was
the
right
of
personal
privacy
in
one's
most
intimate
sexual
relations,
you
were
asked
and
you
didn't
get
a
chance
to
answer
because
you
went
back
on
your
equal
protection
track,
you
are
asking
the
court
to
overrule
bowers
against
hardwick.
i
thought
that
was
very--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
the...
the
statute,
texas
has
already
decided
that
for
us.
it
has
called
this
homosexual
conduct,
so
whether
it's
a
heterosexual
person
or
a
homosexual
person,
the
crime
is
engaging
in
homosexual
conduct.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
texas
permit
same-sex
adoptions...
two
women
or
two
men
to
adopt
a
child
or
to
be
foster
parents?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
in
portraying
what
texas
sees
as
a
family
and
distinguishing
both
married
and
unmarried
heterosexual
people
from
homosexual
people,
those
things
wouldn't
go
together
if
the
state
said
at
the
same
time
said
same
sex
couples
are
qualified
to
raise
a
family.
you
can
adopt
children,
you
can
be
foster
parents.
you
don't
know
what...
what
the
texas
law
is
on
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it
would
be
relevant
to
your
argument
that
they're
making...
that
texas
is
making
the
distinction
between
kinds
of
people
who
have
family
relationships
and
can
be
proper
guardians
of
children
and
those
who
can't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
saying
the
state
of
texas
is
doing
this
for...
to
protect
the
actors
who
are
involved
in
this?
one
can
say
the
state
is
taking
action
to
see
that
people
don't
harm
others
or
themselves.
you're
not
suggesting
that
that's
the
reason
for...
for
this
particular
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but
procreation...
many
people
with
the
blessings
of
texas
can
have
sexual
relations
who
are
unable
to
procreate,
so
i
don't
see
how...
whatever
the
line
might
have
meant
in
times
gone,
it
certainly
isn't
true
that
sexual
relations
are
for
the
purpose
of
procreation
and
anything
that
is
not
for
that
purpose
is
beyond
the
pale.
you
can't
make
that
distinction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
somebody
wants
to
participate
in
the
political
process,
run
for
political
office
who
is
homosexual
and
the
charge
is
made
on
the
other
side
don't...
don't
vote
for
this
person,
this
person
is
a
law
breaker,
there
is
a
closer
connection
to
romer
in
that
regard,
isn't
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
charge...
they
could
be
charged
as
law-breakers.
