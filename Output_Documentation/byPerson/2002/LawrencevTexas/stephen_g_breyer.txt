justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
what
extent
can
you
characterize
it?
i
mean,
the
aclu
brief
has
a
lot
of
evidence
along
this
line.
i...
and
it
seemed
to
me
they
want
to
characterize
it
as
saying
that
the
history
has
gone
exactly
the
opposite
direction
than
what's
been
suggested.
but
if
you
go
back
to
colonial
times
really,
the
laws
not
only
were
different
but
look
at
the
prosecutions.
and
they
did
prosecute
people
for
sex
crimes.
but
they
didn't
prosecute
people
for
same-sex
crimes.
and
then
if
you
go
across
the
history,
it's
only
recently
that
people
have
been
prosecuted
for
same-sex
crimes.
is
that
a
fair
characterization?
what
is
the
real
record?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
their
basic
argument,
i
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
argument
of...
of
bowers,
to
overrule
bowers
is
not
directly
related
to
sodomy.
it's
related,
but
not
directly.
it's
that
people
in
their
own
bedrooms,
which
have
their
right
to
do
basically
what
they
want,
it's
not
hurting
other
people.
and
they...
the
other
side...
says
bowers
understated
the
importance
of
that.
it
got
the
history
wrong.
it
didn't
understand
the
relationship
of
the
sodomy
to
families
and
in
addition,
bowers
has
proved
to
be
harmful
to
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
people,
if
not
because
they're
going
to
be
prosecuted,
because
they
fear
it...
they
might
be,
which
makes
it
a
possible
instrument
of
repression
in
the
hands
of
the
prosecutors.
now,
that's
the
kind
of
argument
that
they're
making.
harmful
in
consequence,
wrong
in
theory,
understating
the
constitutional
value.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
now
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
i
didn't
bring
in
in
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
was,
getting
those
sort
of
three
or
four
basic
points,
i
would
like
to
hear
your...
your
straight
answer
to
those
points--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
on
their
face,
they're...
i
mean,
i'm
not...
not
a
criticism,
i
mean,
directly
responding,
directly
responding
to
the...
to
the...
to
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
this
is
drawing
the
line
at
the
bedroom
door,
this
case
is
inside
the
bedroom,
not
outside.
that's
the
statute
makes
criminal,
to
my
understanding,
of
it
what
takes
place
within
the
bedroom
through
consent.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
why
isn't
that
something
that
the
state
has
no
business
getting
involved
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
long
as
it
doesn't
hurt
anybody?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
you
said...
you
said
procreation,
marriage
and
children,
those
are
your
three
justifications.
now
from
what
you
recently
said,
i
don't
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
marriage,
since,
in
fact,
marriage
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
conduct
that
either
this
or
other
statutes
do
or
don't
forbid.
i
don't
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
children,
since,
in
fact,
the
gay
people
can
certainly
adopt
children
and
they
do.
and
i
don't
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
procreation,
because
that's
the
same
as
the
children.
all
right.
so...
so
what
is
the
justification
for
this
statute,
other
than,
you
know,
it's
not
what
they
say
on
the
other
side,
is
this
is
simply,
i
do
not
like
thee,
doctor
fell,
the
reason
why
i
cannot
tell.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
is
aside...
aside
from
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
they
say,
for
example,
it
is
against
the
law
at
the
dinner
table
to
tell
really
serious
lies
to
your
family?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
really.
it's
very
immoral.
i
mean,
i
know
there's
certainly...
it's
certainly
immoral
to
tell
very
serious
harmful
lies
to
your
own
family
under
certain
circumstances
and
around
the
dinner
table,
some
of
the
worst
things
can
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the...
the...
so
texas
could
go
right
in
there
and
any
kind
of
morality
that
they
think
is
just
immoral
or
bad,
cheating,
perhaps.
what
about
rudeness,
serious
rudeness,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
about
the
statute
which
this
court
i
think
had
to
grapple
with,
people
felt
during
world
war
i
that
it
was
immoral
to
teach
german
in
the
public
schools.
so
then
would
you
say
that
the
state
has
every
right
to
do
that,
parents
want
their
children
to
learn
german,
but
the
schools
forbid
it?
see,
the
hard
question
here
is
can
the
state,
in
fact,
pass
anything
that
it
wants
at
all,
because
they
believe
it's
immoral.
if
you
were
going
to
draw
the
line
somewhere,
i
guess
you
might
begin
to
draw
it
when
the
people
is
involved
inside
his
own
bedroom
and
not
hurting
anybody
else.
now
that...
that
now...
so
you
say
it's
morality.
i...
i
agree
many
people
do
believe
that
that's
a
question
of
morality.
many
do
not,
but
nonetheless,
what
can
you
add
to
what
you're
saying,
other
than
simply
asserting
its
morality?
because
i
don't
think
you
think
that
the
state
could
pass
anything
in
the
name
of
morality?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you've
not
given
a
rational
basis
except
to
repeat
the
word
morality.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
teaching
german.
