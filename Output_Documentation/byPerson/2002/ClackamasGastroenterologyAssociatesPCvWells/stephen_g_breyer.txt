justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
is
the
common
law
rule
on
respondeat
superior
for
an
ordinary
corporation
vis
a
vis
a
director?
is
a
director
of
an
ordinary
corporation
an
employee
of
the
corporation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if...
if
that's
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
answer
was
yes,
was...
he
is
an
employee?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
well,
then
darden
says
common
law,
common
law
says
directors
are
employees,
and
these
are
directors,
end
of
case.
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
may
be
clumsy--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
should
it,
because
i'm
still
stuck
with
the
language
of
darden,
which
reads
as
a
general
rule,
when
congress
has
used
the
term,
employee,
without
defining
it,
we
have
concluded
that
congress
intended
to
describe
the
conventional
master-servant
relationship
as
understood
by
common
law
agency
doctrine,
and
it
says,
that
rule
stood
as
an
independent
authority
for
the
copyright
decision.
so,
too,
should
it
stand
here.
now,
is
your
view,
it
should
not
stand
here
in
this
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
sufficient?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
you're
asking
us
to
depart
from
darden
and
to
make
an
exception
from
the
darden
rule
for
the...
this
particular
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
when
you
say
circumstance,
there's
a
word
in
an
act,
so
you're
saying
that
the
word,
employee,
in
this
title
of
the
ada
does
not
bear
the
common
law
definition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i'm
asking...
they
said
in
darden
that's
the
end
of
it,
and
you
say...
i
want
to
be
just
clear
about
it.
you
say,
it
is
not
the
end
of
it.
common
law
is
not
the
end
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
now
i
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
exactly
my
point.
that's
why
i
started
out
asking
you
whether
you
concede
that
a
director
of
a
corporation
is
an
employee
under
the
common
law,
because
if
you
concede
that,
you're
saying
that
the
common
law
fluid
test
ends
up
with
the
director
being
an
employee,
and
i
take
it
that
it's
well-established
a
director
is
an
employee.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
my
question
was
to
try
to
get
the
framework.
either
you're
saying
the
common
law,
you
win,
or
you're
saying,
common
law,
i
lose,
but
i
win
anyway
because
it's
not
the
common
law,
so
if
you
want
to
take
the
tack,
common
law
test,
i
still
win,
explain
it
to
me.
how
is
a
director
ordinarily
an
employee,
but
this
one
isn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
we're
away
from--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
thought
you
had
a
very
good
case
in
your
brief,
and
then
i
read
darden,
and
i
realized
the
reason
i
was
thinking
it,
i
was
out
of
date
and
thinking
that
hearst
was
still
good
law.
that's
frankfurter's
opinion
on
employee.
i
thought
it
was
a
great
opinion,
all
right,
but
i
can't
square
that
with
what
the
court
said.
that
was
my
initial
question,
and
i'm
still
there,
because
i
haven't
really
heard
you
explain
why
it
is
that
the
common
law
test
won't
pick
up
your
clients.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
owe
deference
to
the
eeoc
standard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
hate
to
be
a
bore
on
this,
but
will
you
please
write
the
two
sentences
for
me
where
i
have
to
say
either
that,
we
apply
the
common
law
test,
and
in
this
instance,
the
common
law
test
comes
out
in
your
favor,
or
we
have
to
say,
we
don't
apply
the
common
law
test
because
the
ee...
this
statute
is
different.
which
of
those
two
paths,
both
of
which
could
lead
to
your
victory
or
your
defeat,
do
you
think
we
should
take?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
neither,
all
right.
then
write
that
section
of
the
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how...
how
does
the
eeoc
treat
an
ordinary
corporation
that,
let's
say,
has
12
regular
employees
and
then
three
directors,
the
cousin,
the
father,
the
son,
or
whatever,
of
the
owner,
so
there...
so
it's
as...
if
you
count
the
three...
and
it's
a
perfectly
ordinary
corporation.
there's
nothing
special
about
it.
do
they
count
those
three
directors,
or
not,
as
employees?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
remember,
these
three
are
just
cousins.
they're
not...
i
mean,
they
only
show
up
once
a
year,
and
they
vote,
and...
and
that's
it.
that's
their
connection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
they
count
them
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
don't
count?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then...
and
those
are
people
who
the
common
law
really
would
consider
to
be
employees,
at
least
while
they're
there
for
that
hour
a
year,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they're
there
once
a
year
for
an
hour,
and
during
that
time
they
spill
some
water,
somebody
slips...
i
mean,
a
corporation,
i
guess,
would
be
liable,
or...
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
for
that
hour.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
why,
because
i
would
think
then
you
lose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
have
to
do
is
follow
the
common
law
definition.
that's
darden.
so
if
darden
applies,
i
take
it
you
win,
but
if
darden
doesn't
apply,
it
seems
to
be
much
harder
for
you
to
win,
because
then
the
agency
should
get
deference
under
skidmore,
at
least,
in
applying
the
term,
and
the
agency
here
has
a
different
definition
than
the
one
that
helps
you.
so
that's
where
i
am,
and
i'm
quite
uncertain
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i'm
quite...
still...
i
hate
to
go
back
to
this,
but
it
seems
to
me
there
might
be
millions
of
small
businesses
in
the
country
that
have
about
10
or
12
employees
where
if
you
count
their
directors,
they
are
going
to
be
covered,
and
if
you
don't
count
them,
they
won't
be,
and
i'm
curious
about
the
practical
effect
of
that.
of
course,
if
the
eeoc
counts
them
now,
there's
no
problem.
if
it
doesn't
count
them
now,
this
decision
would...
would
affect
that.
do
you
have
any
sense
of
what
the
facts
are?
