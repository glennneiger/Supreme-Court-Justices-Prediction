mr.
steven
w.
seymour
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
four
doctors
who
are
shareholder-directors
of
the
petitioner
are
not
employees
under
the
ada,
the
americans
with
disabilities
act,
because,
like
partners,
they
own
and
manage
their
own
clinic.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
in
an
ordinary
corporation,
the
common
law
rule
is
that
the
employee
is
like
a
servant.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
i'm
sorry.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
yes.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
because
darden
doesn't
apply
here.
darden
was--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--i
believe
i
did.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
yes.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
well,
the
difference
between
this
case
and
darden
is
significant.
darden
was
a
case
in
which
the
court
was
required
to
determine
whether
an
individual
was
an
independent
contractor--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--or
an
employee.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
that's
not
a
choice
here.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
that's
right.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
because
there
are
frankly
not
much
common
law
that
gives
us
guidance
on
how
to
decide
whether
a
director-shareholder
in
a
professional
corporation
is
an
employee
or
not.
the...
in
darden,
it
cited
factors
that
are
really
quite
good
at
determining
whether
an
individual
is
an
independent
contractor
or
an
employee.
those
factors
don't
work
very
well
here,
because
they're
not
designed
to
address
the
issues
that
we're
looking
at.
that
is,
for
example,
one
of
the
factors
that
the
common
law
looks
to
to
determine
whether
a...
an
individual
is
an
independent
contractor
is
whether
the
individual
provides
their
own
tools
of
the
trade.
well,
that's
not
the
kind
of
factor
that's
going
to
work
very
well
in
this
kind
of
case.
therefore,
we're
suggesting
that
a
darden-like
analysis
is
very
appropriate,
but
we
think
that
it's
better
to
use
factors
such
as
suggested
by
the
government
in
their
brief,
that
is,
the
eeoc
guidance,
because
those
kinds
of
factors
suggested
in
the
eeoc
guidance
go
the
heart
of
the
difference
between
shareholder-directors
and
employees.
the
factors
in
darden
do
not,
so
therefore
the
darden
factors
are
like
trying
to
pound
a
round
peg
into
a
square
hole.
we
shouldn't
do
that,
because
it
becomes
clumsy.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
yes,
your
honor,
except
that
i
think
that
the...
the
tax
purposes
were
more
under
the
general
tax
laws,
not
under
erisa,
because
they
could
establish
an
erisa
plan
and
deduct
the
expenses.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
yes.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
and...
and
just--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--well,
they're
treated
as
employees
for
that
purpose,
but
they
should
not
be
treated
as
employees
for
purposes
of
the
ada.
for
example,
if
we
turn
the
coin
over
and
look
at
the
other
side,
and
the
court
is
required
to
examine
whether
someone
who
is
labeled
a
partner
is,
in
reality,
a...
an
employee.
if
the
court
finds
that,
looking
at
the
economic
realities
of
that
situation,
that
the
partner
is
really
an
employee,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
now-employer
should
issue
w-2's,
or
that
they
should
have
been
withholding.
those
are
tax
issues,
and
they
don't
have
the
same
purposes
as
the
ada.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
yes.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
under
oregon
law,
they
can
opt
out
of
worker's
compensation.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
yes.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
they
get
salaries
plus
a
bonus,
which
is
the
division
of
their
profits.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
that's
true.
there's
nothing
inconsistent
about
that,
and
our
concern
with
this
case
is,
the
court
didn't
go
past
the
fact
that
the
clinic
was
organized
as
a
professional
corporation,
and
when
the--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--that's
our
view.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
that's
our
view.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
for
this--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--for
this
particular
circumstance,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
well,
i
think
the
common
law
definition
is
one
thing
to
look
at.
that
is
the--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--yes,
that's
what
we're
saying.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
common
law
is
not
the
end
of
it.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
no,
there
isn't
much
in
the
common
law,
because
a
professional
corporation
is
not
a
product
of
the
common
law,
nor
is
a
limited
liability
partnership,
nor
a
limited
liability
company,
and
all
three
of
those
organizations
are
virtually
functionally
identical
once
they're
up
and
running.
they
have
the
same--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--attributes,
yes,
but
not
that
focus
on
this
particular
question,
and
that
is
whether
a
shareholder-director
in
a
professional
corporation
should
be
considered
an
employee
for
purposes
of
defining
who--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--and
a
more
fluid
test
would
be
certainly
more
flexible,
because--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--well,
that's...
i...
i
understood
your
question
to
be--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--well,
under
an
ordinary
corporation,
i
think
your...
your
question
would
be
yes,
but
under
a
professional
corporation,
it's
different.
it's
much
more
like
a
partnership,
because
if
we
look
at
the
emergence
of
these
new
entities
like
limited
liability
partnerships,
limited
liability
corporations,
and
professional
corporations,
they're
all
emerging
for
professional
businesses
like
this
clinic
from
sole
proprietorships
or
general
partnerships,
and
the
only...
there's
really
no
difference,
functionally,
when
we
look
at
those
different
entities.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
no,
the--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--in
the
partnership,
individuals
are
liable,
but
in
a
professional
corporation,
in
a
limited
liability
partnership,
in
a
limited
liability
company,
the...
for
professionals,
those
limited
liabilities
are
all
the
same,
and
they're
not
as
good
as
a
general
corporation,
or
an
ordinary
corporation.
in
other
words,
the
doctors
in
this
clinic,
in
a
pc,
have
liability
for
their
own
acts,
and
limited
vicarious
liability
for
the
acts
of
the
other
doctors.
that's
not
true
inside
an
ordinary
corporation.
it
is
true
inside
a
limited
liability
partnership
and
a
limited
liability
company.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
that's
right,
it's
for
malpractice-type
claims,
and
i
think--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--that's
pretty
much
true
not
just
in--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--yes,
they
do,
and
that's
true
for
all
three
of
those
emerging
types
of
entities,
professional
corporations,
limited
liability
partnerships,
and
limited
liability
companies.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
well,
for
example,
as
a
partner
in
a
partnership,
limited
liability
partnership,
i
have
exactly
the
same
limits
on
my
liability
as
the
doctors
in
this
clinic,
and
i
am
not
an
employee,
i'm
a
partner,
and
the
only
difference
between
my
status
and
the
status
of
these
doctors
is
the
form
of
the
business,
and
that's
really
just
a
label.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
well,
every
court
that's
addressed
the
issue
of
whether
partners
are
employees,
including
this
court--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--i'm
sure
there
are
some
who
would
say
that,
but
i
think
that
what
the
courts
need
to
do
is
look
at
the
individual,
not
just
at
a
label,
and
look
beyond
the
label
to
find
out,
as
the
eeoc
standards--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--yes.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
but
i'm
saying
that
a...
a
limited
liability
partnership
and
a
professional
corporation
should
be
treated
alike
for
purposes
of
the
eeoc.
excuse
me,
for
purposes
of--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--pardon
me?
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
and
i'm...
if
i
may,
the...
the
problem
with
darden
is,
it's
examining
a
different
relationship
than
we
have
in
this
case.
in
the
darden
case,
the
issue
was
whether
an
individual
was
an
independent
contractor,
and
we
deal
with
those
issues
all
the
time.
our
clients
come
and
say,
i
want
to
be
an
independent
contractor,
or
make
my
employees
independent
contractors,
and
we
have
to
go
through
the
books
and
say,
no,
we
can't
let
you
do
that
because
of
darden,
or
whatever.
we
don't
see
those
kinds
of
circumstances
in
the
law.
there's
no
common
law--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--well--
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
--the
reason
that
it's
bad...
yes,
it
is
all
bad.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
and
the
reason
is
that
we
should
treat
similarly
situated
businesses
the
same,
and
there
are
a...
a
class
of
partner-like
or
proprietor-like
individuals,
and
there
is
a
class
of
employee-like
individuals,
and
just
because...
let's
say
it
starts
out
as
a
general
partnership.
just
because
they
shift
into
a
limited
liability
partnership,
or
a
professional
corporation,
or
a
limited
liability
company,
that
shouldn't
change
who
belongs
in
which
class,
and
if
we
look
beyond
the
label
of
professional
corporation,
then
we
can
see
what
the
relationships
are
and
therefore
settle
that
issue.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
steven
w.
seymour
thank
you.
the
protected
class,
people
in
the
protected
class
should
be
the
same
as
are
counted
toward
the
15-employee
threshold.
that
is,
we
should
look
at
the
individuals
in
the
business
enterprise
the
same,
whether
we
are
determining
whether
they
are
eligible
to
file
a
lawsuit,
or
are
protected
by
the
act,
or
are
counted
towards
the
act's
coverage.
must
these
doctors
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet?
what
we're
saying
is
that
what
these
doctors
deserve
is
to
be
treated
the
same
as
their
colleagues
in
businesses
that
are
identical,
but
have
a
different
form.
that
is,
these
doctors
in
the
professional
corporation
should
be
treated
the
same
as
doctors
in
a
limited
liability
partnership
or
a
limited
liability
company.
would
it
be
simpler
to
simply
look
at
the
form
of
the
business
and
stop
there?
it
would,
but
it
would
also
be
simpler
if
we
looked
at
the
term,
partner
and
said,
well,
partners
can
never
be
employees,
or
we
look
at
the
term,
independent
contractor,
and
say
well,
independent
contractors
can
never
be
employees,
but
we
don't
do
that
for
good
reasons.
we
look
beyond
the
label,
and
i'm
suggesting
that
that
is
appropriate
here
as
well.
look
beyond
the
label
and
see
what
the
realities
are,
a
reality
check.
does
the
eeoc
count
directors
as
employees?
generally,
in...
in
business
law
there's
a
big
difference
between
a
director,
an
officer,
a
shareholder,
and
an
employee,
so
as
i
read
the
eeoc
guidance,
that
is
a
vehicle
through
which
businesses,
courts,
and
the
eeoc
can
look
at
an
individual
and
determine,
well,
is
the...
is
the
label,
director,
in
this
circumstance
appropriate,
or
are
they
really
functioning
as
an
employee?
you
can,
of
course,
have
inside
directors,
that
is,
employees
who
are
appointed
to
the
board
of
directors,
or
you
can
have
outside
directors
in
some
circumstances
where
they
aren't
affiliated
except
in
an
advisory
role,
as
a
member
of
the
board,
and
they...
members
of
the
board
of
directors
could
be
paid
or
they
could
be
not
paid,
and
i
don't
think
that's
an
issue
that
should
necessarily
be
determinative
on
deciding
whether
or
not
they
are
an
employee.
the
court
of
appeals
here
did
not
look
beyond
the
fact
that
the
shareholder-directors
had
organized
as
a
professional
corporation,
but
the
trial
court
did,
and
looked
at
factors
similar
to
those
identified
in
the
eeoc
guidance,
and
concluded
that
these
shareholder-directors
were
not
employees.
we
believe
that
is
the
correct
approach
the
court
should
take.
