would...
would
you
say
that
the
eeoc
guidelines
and
writings
and
treatises
on
the
differences
between
professional
corporations
and
other
corporations
might
themselves
be
part
of
what
we
call
the
common
law?
i...
i
take
it
part
of
your
position
is
based
on
the
proposition
that
the
common
law,
i
suppose
of
agency,
up
through
the
1950s
just
didn't
have
much
on
this
subject
at
all,
when
we're
talking
about
the
difference
between
partners
and
professional
and...
and
employees
of
a
professional
corporation.
there
just
wasn't
a
corpus
of
writing
on
that
subject.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
as...
as
courts
begin
to
write
about
these
things
in
the
area
of
subchapter
s
status,
tax
status
and
so
forth,
there
is
an
emerging
decisional
law,
at
least,
that's...
that's
evolving,
i
take
it,
and
you
might
say
that
has
some
common
law
attributes.
it
might
not
be
common
law
as
we...
as
we
usually
define
it.
