justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
what
is
your
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
didn't
even
cite
darden,
i
don't
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
think
darden
would
be
the
first
place
we'd
look.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
the
decision
has
to
be
made
on
whether
these
people
are
employees.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
darden
says,
well,
we're
going
to
look
to
the
common
law,
so
what
makes
you
think
we'd
do
something
else
in
this
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
how
they
qualified
under
erisa.
we
set
this
thing
up
solely
for
that
reason.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
didn't
they...
in
order
to
be
covered,
didn't
they
have
to
be
employees?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
don't
have
a
partnership
here.
we
have
a
professional
corporation--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
we
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
we're
not
talking
about
partnership.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
the
price
that
has
to
be
paid
for
professionals
to
set
up
a
professional
corporation
is
to
be
subject
to
the
ada,
and
the
anti-discrimination
law
of
title
vii,
and
so
forth,
because
these
people
are
going
to
be
counted.
in
this
case,
it
makes
a
difference.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
all
bad,
that
they
have
to
be
subject
to
these
provisions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
say
that
the
eeoc
has
adopted
standards
that
differ
from
the
common
law,
and
has
by
regulation
or
otherwise
determined
that
we
should
apply
its
test
to
this
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
agree
with
the
petitioner's
attorney
that
if
you
look
to
the
common
law
test,
these
people
would
be
employees?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
we
were
looking
to
see
if
some
other,
lower
employee
was
covered,
not
these
directors,
and
that
turns
on
whether
you
count
them
as
employees--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we're
not
looking
to
see
if
they
themselves
are
covered
under
the
ada
in
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
just
thought
congress
was
more
concerned
with
not
making
really
small
businesses
covered
by
these
acts,
that
we
weren't
focused
on
whether
these
professional
shareholders
should
be
covered,
but
whether
this
was
the
kind
of
small
business
that
shouldn't
be
covered
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
we
have
to
give
some
weight
to
the
eeoc
view?
do
you
just
want
to
ignore
it
completely?
