mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it...
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
eeoc's
guidance,
the
question
whether
shareholder-directors
are
employees
depends
on
whether
they
operate
independently
and
manage
the
business
or,
instead,
are
subject
to
the
organization's
control.
that
standard
aligns
the
test
for
determining
the
employment
status
of
shareholder-directors
with
the
test
that
courts
have
long
used
in
deciding
whether
partners
are
employees.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
guess
largely,
yes.
the
eeoc
started
with
the
common,
common
law
right
to
control
test
that
is
used
to
distinguish
between
independent
contractors
and
employees
and
adapted
it
to
make
a
distinction
between
those
who
were
the
proprietors
of
the
business
and
that
business'
employees,
and
it
did
so
in
a
way
to
align
its
standards
for
looking
at
the
question
of
shareholder-director
with
the
same
standards
that
have
been
used
by
all
the
courts
in
deciding
whether
partners
or...
are
employees--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--if
you
look
to
the
restatement
as
the
measure
of
the
common
law--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--then
generally
speaking,
a...
a
director
who
didn't
employ
service...
perform
services
would
not
have
been
an
employee,
but
a
director
who
performed
services
would
be.
now,
the
only
hesitation
i
would
have
is
to
say
that
the...
that
at
the
time
of
the
restatement
there
wasn't...
there
weren't
professional
corporations
that
mixed
and
matched
features
of
partnership
and
corporations,
so
there's
not
as
clear
an
answer
on
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the...
the
court
should
give
weight
to
the...
the
eeoc's
test
because
it
reflects
its
accumulated
and
longstanding
experience
in
administering
the
act,
but
we're
not
asking
for
chevron
deference
here.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it...
it
did
say
that,
that
it...
it
doesn't
get
chevron
deference.
now,
there
is
an
exception
now.
under
the
ada,
the
eeoc
can
issue
regulations,
and
this
court
has
held
that
those
regulations
are
entitled
to
chevron
deference,
but
this
is
guidance
that
applies
across
the
board
to
all
the
nondiscrimination
laws,
and
what
the
court
has
said
in
that
context
is
that
the
eeoc's
analysis
gets
weight,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
it
has
accumulated
experience
under
the
law.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
would
be
a
skidmore
deference,
that's
correct.
now,
what--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--neither
of
those
two,
justice
breyer.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i...
let
me
get
to
darden,
because
i
think
that's
the
focus
of
your
questions.
as
we
read
darden,
there
is
language
that
is
certainly
broad
enough
in
it
to
say
that
any
time
you
use
the
word,
employee,
you
mean
common
law
employee,
but
i
think
that
those,
what...
you
have
to
understand
darden
in
the
context
of
the...
the
issue
it
was
resolving
in
that
case,
and
there
it
was
trying
to
draw
a
distinction,
whether
the
term
employee
embraces
independent
contractors,
and
in
that
setting,
congress
had
twice
amended
statutes
to
make
clear
that
the
term,
employee,
did
not
mean
independent
contractor
after
this
court
has
said
that
it
could,
and
in
that
context,
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
start
out
with
a
very
strong
presumption
that
when
congress
uses
the
term,
employee,
it
does
not
mean
independent
contractor.
but
that's
not
the
situation
we
have
here,
and
in
other
cases
where
the
court
has
looked
at
statutes
that
use
common
law
terms,
like
title
vii
does
with
respect
to
the
term,
agent,
it
has
felt
a
lot
more
freedom
to
adjust
that
common
law
term
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
and
i
would
point
you
to
the
faragher
case
and
the
kolstadt
case
as
two
examples
of
that,
and
that's
what
the
eeoc
has
done
here.
it
has
adapted
that
common
law
principle
in
light
of
the
fact
that
we
have
an
established
tradition
in
the
courts,
well-established,
of
looking
at
the
question
of
partnership
in
a
functional
way,
does
this
person
actually
operate
as
a
proprietor
of
the
business,
or
is
this
a
partner
in
name
only,
and
it
makes
perfect
sense
for
the
eeoc
to
apply
that
same
kind
of
functional
analysis
in
deciding
whether
shareholder-directors
are
employees,
because
for
purposes
of
deciding
who
should
get
the
protection
of
the
act,
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about
primarily
here,
there
is
no
practical
difference
between
shareholder-directors
who
run
a
business
and
partners
who
run
a
business,
and
so
it
makes
sense
to...
to
use
the
same
test.
applying
the
same
test
also
makes
sense
in
light
of
the
purposes
of
the
small
business
exemption,
because
the
purpose
of
that
exemption
is
to
spare
small
businesses
the
very
substantial
burdens
of
complying
with
the
nondiscrimination
laws,
and
those
burdens
are
experienced
in
exactly
the
same
way
regardless
of
whether
those
who
choose
to
organize
a
small
business
do
so
through
a
partnership
form
or
a
corporate
form,
and
the...
the
analysis
that
the
tests
should
be
the
same
across
the
board
also
makes--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--yes,
we
do.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
it...
it's
possible
that's
true,
but
what
the
eeoc's
guidance--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--you
make--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--what...
what
we
have
here
under
the
eeoc's
guidance
is,
ultimately
you
make
an
overall
judgment
that's
either-or,
based
on
all
the
considerations
in
the
guidance,
and
they
are
at
page
9
of
our
brief,
so
that,
just
as
in
the
partnership
context,
you
look
at
all
of
these
factors,
and
just
as
you
would
in
an
independent
contractor
status
kind
of
situation,
you
look
at
all
the
relevant
factors,
and
then
you
make
an
overall
judgment
about,
essentially
does
this
person
function
as
a
proprietor
of
the
business,
or
is
he
functioning
as
an
employee
of
the
business
overall.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the...
the
approach
that
the
eeoc
has
taken
is
to...
is
a
functional
approach
that
tries
to
treat
all
people
alike,
and
to
look
to
the
real
functional
relationship
between
the
individual
and
the
employee,
and
the
fact
that
somebody
may
have
chosen
to
do
something
for
tax
consequences,
or
chose
to
do
something
for
purposes
of
limiting
individual
liability,
really
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
he
is
the
sort
of
person
who
should
receive
protection
under
the
nondiscrimination
laws,
and
this
is
ultimately
what
we
are
determining
here,
are
these
shareholder-directors
people
who
are
employees
and
therefore
receive
protection
under
the
nondiscrimination
laws,
because
it's
only
those
people
who
are
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
in
order
to
answer
the
question
you
have
in
front
of
you,
which
is,
is
this
a
small
business
and
does
this
employee
get
protection,
you
first
have
to
answer
the
question
of,
are
these
shareholder-directors
employees
who
get
protection
under
the
law,
so
that
is
the
inevitable
product
of
having
to
decide
the
small
business
exemption,
is
that
you
have
to
decide,
these
are
people
who
get
protection
under
the
laws,
and
it...
it's
just
not
the
case
that
the
policies
that
underlie
decisions
about
incorporation
having
to
do
with
tax
consequences
and
individual
liability
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
these
are
the
kind
of
people
who
should
receive
protection
under
the
nondiscrimination
laws.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well...
i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i...
what
congress
did
in
the
small
business
exemption
is
to
link
the
exemption
to
the
number
of
people
who
receive
protection
under
the
laws,
and
that
makes
sense,
because
it
means
that
at
most,
when
the
small
business
exemption
applies,
at
most,
14
individuals
will
be
excluded
who
otherwise
would
have
had
protection.
