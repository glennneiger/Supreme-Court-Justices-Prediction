mr.
craig
a.
crispin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
clinic
and
the
government
in
this
case
essentially
is
to
look
to
ignore
the
form
and
structure
of
the
corporate
business,
yet
just
2
years
ago,
in
cedric
kushner
versus
king,
this
court
held
that
a
sole
shareholder
was
separate
and
distinct
from
the
corporate
structure
itself,
and
that's
the...
the
essence
of
the
question.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
that
was
a
rico
question,
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
two
parts
of
the...
the
rico
enterprise
on
the
one
hand
and
the...
the
other
aspect
of
the
rico
question
existed
with
both
the
individual
sole
shareholder
and
director
of
the
corporation
as
being
separate
and
distinct
from
the
corporation
itself,
and
in
that
case
the
court
said,
you
cannot
collapse
the
two.
the
defense
position
was,
they
are,
in
fact,
the
same
identity,
and
this
court
said
no,
that's
not
true.
what...
the
corporate
structure
is
something
separate
and
distinct,
which
is
recognized
by
this
court,
has
been
recognized
for
years
and
years
and
years,
and
that
that
is
something
that
cannot
and
should
not
be
ignored.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
justice
souter,
the
individuals
that
are
subject
to
discrimination
in
this
particular
case
are
not
only
the
lower-level
employees
as
this
case
presents.
we
have
four
shareholder-directors,
and
any
one
of
those
could
come
down
with
a
disability
and
have
the
remaining
three
shareholders
refuse
to
accommodate
or
otherwise
violate
the
ada
with
respect
to
that
one
individual,
so
the...
the
individual--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--that's
correct.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
that's
right,
your
honor,
i...
although
i...
let
me
comment
that
i'm
not
sure
i
would
concede
the
51
percent,
all...
i
would
concede
it
for
your
hypothetical.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
but
our
position
is
that
the
employing
enterprise
is
the
determining
factor.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
as
i
read
their
position,
i...
i
believe
that
they,
under
the
new
guidance,
would
count
those
directors
under
their
balancing
test.
they
would
apply
the...
this
multiple-factor
balancing
test,
look
at
the
degree
of
control,
and
decide
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
well,
in
that
case,
your
honor--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--in
that
case,
your
honor,
they
would
not
be
counted.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
they
don't
count,
because
they're
not
performing
services--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
would
be.
we
know
that...
that
employee
is
considered
a
person
who
performs
services
for
the
corporation--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--on
their
acts,
if
they
are
performing
services--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--for
the
corporation
for
compensation
they
would
at...
for
that
hour--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--be
considered
employees.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
now,
of
course,
under
the
ada
we're
looking
at
numbers
of
employees
over
20
weeks
within
a
calendar
year.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
but
again,
the
idea,
as
this
court
recognized
in
walters
versus
metro
educational,
was
that
the
determinations
under
the
employment
discrimination
statutes
should
be
subject
to
ready
and
easy
determination.
complex
and
expensive
factual
inquiries
should
be
avoided,
but
yet
the
government's
test
and
the
clinic's
test,
which
has
adopted
the
government's
test,
would
have
this
court
look
at
the
facts
in
each
individual
case
every
time--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--no,
your
honor.
the
skidmore
deference
is
appropriate,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
your
honor,
two...
two
responses
to
your
question.
under
darden,
it...
it
does...
the
court
has
decided
that
the
common
law
applies,
and
we
would
say
that's
appropriate.
the
precise
test
under
darden
dealt
with
the
independent
contractor
versus
employee
test.
that
is
not
absolutely
translatable
here,
but
the
key
concept
is
that
the
common
law
applies
is
appropriate.
the
second
aspect
of
your
question,
your
honor,
was
on
the
deference
entitled
to
the
eeoc
opinion,
and
as
i
understand
skidmore
deference,
it's
only
that
deference
which
is
appropriate
under
the
circumstances
of
their
test.
in
this
case,
the
eeoc's
test
is
not
workable.
it
leads
to
inconsistent
results,
and
it
fails
to
further
the...
the
interests
that
are
looked
at
under
the
statute,
and
i
can
turn
to
those
points.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
mr.
chief
justice,
it
may
address
it,
but
it
need
not.
it
need
not
treat
a
corporation,
whether
it's
a
professional
corporation
or
a
general
corporation,
differently--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--it's
not
a
reasonable
decision
in
looking
at
the
professional
corporation
as
the
eeoc's
test
would
apply
to
it,
and...
and
the
reasons
are
that,
as...
as
the
eeoc
and
the
clinic
has
suggested,
an
important
issue
is
one
of
consistency,
yet
applying
their
test
does
not
lead
to
consistent
results.
one
can
imagine
the...
the
circumstance
of
a
professional
corporation
with
one
shareholder-director
and
14
employees.
under
their
test,
that
individual
corporation
would
not
be
covered.
it
has
fewer
than
15.
take
the
situation,
though,
where
there
are
14,
15
director-shareholders
of
the
professional
corporation
and
14
employees,
a
business
nearly
twice
the
size
of
the
first
one,
and
yet
that
one
would
be
covered
because
of
the
15
employees.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
well,
as
i...
as
i
read
the
test,
what
the
eeoc
would
do
in
that
circumstance
would
look
at
the
number
of
employees,
and
the
15
employees,
whether
there
was
1
or
14
shareholders
would
make
no
difference,
and...
and
yet
with
15
or
14,
or
15
or
25
shareholders,
whether
or
not
they
were
considered
employees
or
not,
the
15
individual
employees
would
be
enough
to
provide
coverage,
yet
take
the
same
circumstance
and
back
off
the
one
with
the
number
of
employees,
and
under
the
eeoc's
test,
it
would
be
a
factual
shareholder-by-shareholder
determination
which
would
be
required
to
determine
whether
this
company...
corporation
is,
in
fact,
covered
or
not.
and
so
we
have
the
situations
where
many
more
entities,
enterprises
with
a
lot
of
people
working
for
them,
which
may
not
be
covered
on
the
one
hand,
and
down
the
street
a
very
similar
corporation--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--that...
that's
right,
unless
they
have
less
than
15
employees,
but
yet
in
a
professional
corporation
as
we
have
here,
the
individual
shareholders
are
performing
services
for
the
corporation.
in
fact,
that's
the
business
of
the
corporation,
is
to
provide
the
medical
services
that
these
four
shareholders
were
performing.
they
created
revenue
which
came
into
the
corporation,
they
got
the
benefits
of
the
corporate
structure
for
tax
benefits
and
for
erisa
purposes,
and
yet
they...
and
yet
the
eeoc
would...
would
put
a
factual
determination
on
whether
or
not
one
or
more
of
the
individuals
were,
in
fact,
employees.
the
interest
of
predictability
would
be
lost
in
such
a
situation.
predictability
is
important
for
both
the
enterprise
itself
to
know
whether
it's
covered,
and
also
for
the
individual
employee,
the
secretary
or
the
nurse
down
the
hall.
in
a...
a
test
that
says,
we
adopt
the
corporate
structure
as
the
appropriate
test,
those
individuals,
the
enterprise,
the
nurse,
the
secretary,
all
they
have
to
do
is
look
at
their
paycheck
to
see
if
it's
a
corporation,
and
count
up
the
number
of
people
working
for
that
corporation,
performing
services--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--i...
i
think
that's
a
possibility,
yes.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
in...
in
my
practice,
which
is
exclusively
dealing
with
employment
matters,
yes,
we
see
that,
individuals
who
are
quite
concerned.
also,
i
am
aware
of,
although
i
cannot
cite
you
to
studies
which
indicate
that
fear
of
retaliation
for
bringing
a
claim
is
a
real
factor
on
individuals.
if
they
know
they're
not
protected,
they
don't
bring
the
claim.
now,
that's--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--that's
true.
if
they...
if
they
know
they're
not
protected,
then
they...
they
don't
risk
the
kind
of
retaliation
for
raising
the
claim,
and
they
go
on
and
just
do
their
jobs.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
i
think
the
numbers
are
significant,
that
there
are
quite
a
number
of...
of
small
businesses
in
that
category,
professional
corporations,
but
whether
that's
a
factor
that
should
enter
into
the
court
is,
of
course,
your
decision,
not
mine,
but
if
congress...
but
the...
the
touchstone
of
that
question,
then,
would
be,
though,
the
intent
of...
of
congress,
whether
congress
intended
the
term,
employee,
to
have
a
common
law
application
and,
if
that's
the
case,
then
they
should
be,
in
fact,
covered.
that's
what
congress
wanted
to
do.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
well,
your
honor,
number...
i've
got
two
responses
to
that.
number
1,
it...
it's
one
example
of
a
way
that
it
would
provide
inconsistent
results,
but
i
just
talked
about
a
different
one
which
is
very
different,
which
provides
inconsistent
results
by
their
test.
second,
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
partnership
is
not
subject
to
title
vii
or
ada
because
it's
a
partnership.
some
of
the
lower
courts
have
done
that,
and
justice
powell
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
hishon
case
did,
in
fact,
address
that,
but
this
court
has
never
so
held.
that's
not
a
question
that
this
court
need
address
in
this
opinion,
but
it
is
something
that
the
court
may
want
to
look
at
in
terms
of,
under
the...
for
example,
under
the
restatement
second
of
agency
in
1958,
the
partnership
was
recognized
as
being
able
to
have
employees
as
members
of
its
partners
who
were
performing
services
for
that
partnership,
so--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--justice
ginsburg,
i...
i
believe...
i
believe
your
question
addresses
whether
those
directors
who
are
not
involved
day-to-day--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--would
be
covered
as
employees,
but
the
common
law
test,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
there's
a
question
of
compensation.
if
the
services
are
being
provided,
and
there's
compensation
for
those
services,
then
the
individual
would
be
counted
as
an
employee
and,
as
we
indicated
earlier,
the
question
under
the
ada
deals
with
five
work
days
in
20
different
weeks,
so
the...
the
director
who
comes
in
just
on
occasional
basis,
even
if
compensated,
would
not
be
enough
to...
to,
typically
to
add
another
employee.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
your
honor,
the...
the
decision
of
this
court
in,
in
the
a...
in
determining
what
employees
count
for
ada
purposes
was,
the...
the
decision
was
the
payroll
method,
and
looked
to
the
payroll,
whether
an
individual
is
on
the
payroll
for
5
days
of
the
week
for
20
weeks
in
the
preceding
or
current
calendar
year,
so
the
director,
if
that
director
is
performing
services
adequate
to
put
him
or
her
on
the
payroll
for
the
entire
week,
would
be
counted
as
an
employee
for
that
particular
week.
i...
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
be
a
rare
occasion
where
a
director
who
had
no
other
role
in
the
company
but
to
come
in
and
sit
in
on
a
meeting
or
keep
up
with
things
would
appear
on
the
payroll,
but
if
they
were,
then
they
should
be
counted
as
employees,
because
they
are
performing
services,
receiving
compensation,
and
then
it
just
simply
moves
into
the...
the
method
of
counting
those
employees.
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
they
are
on
salary.
they
work
every
day.
the
compensation
or
revenue
they
produce
goes
into
the
corporation.
they
enjoy
the
corporate
shield
from
liability
for
all
but
that
small
category
of
exposure
to
malpractice
cases--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--it
very
well
may
be
the
largest
monetary,
but
one
could...
could
list
a
number
of
things,
such
as
liability
on
the
leasehold,
liability
for
employee
claims,
liability
for
employment
contracts,
liability
for
tax
payments,
that
would
be
the
liability
of
the
corporation,
and
for
which
the
individual
shareholder-directors
would
not
have--
mr.
craig
a.
crispin
--exactly,
mr.
chief
justice,
that...
that
is
correct,
and
so,
from
the...
the
monetary
standpoint,
as
i
said,
that
would
be
the
greatest
problem,
but
the...
the
idea
of
limited
liability
exists
in
this
corporation,
as
it
does,
in
fact,
in
the
limited
liability
partnerships
and
limited
liability
companies,
and
if
the
touchstone
is
whether
there
are
corporate
limited
liability
features,
then
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whatsoever
whether
we're
dealing
with
a
limited
liability
partnership,
limited
liability
corporation,
a
professional
corporation,
or
a
general
corporation,
individuals
would
be
employees
if
they
met
the
requirements
otherwise.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i'll
conclude.
