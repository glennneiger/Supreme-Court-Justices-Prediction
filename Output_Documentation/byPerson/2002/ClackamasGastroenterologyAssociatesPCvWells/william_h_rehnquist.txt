chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
01-1435,
clackamas
gastroenterology
association
versus
deborah
wells.
mr.
seymour.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who...
darden
also
says,
a
couple
of
pages
after
the
quote
that
justice
breyer...
since
the
common
law
test
contains
no
shorthand
formula
or
magic
phrase
that
can
be
applied
to
find
the
answer,
all
of
the
incidents
of
the
relationship
must
be
assessed
and
weighed
with
no
one
factor
being
decisive,
which
suggests
a
more
fluid
test,
certainly,
than
the
other
language.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
seymour.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
crispin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
kind
of
a
legal
issue
was
it
there,
mr.
crispin?
what
act
were
we
construing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
it,
perhaps
better
than
the,
just
straight
common
law,
of
course,
deal
with
the
coming
of...
of
age,
so
to
speak,
of
the
professional
corporation,
which
really
didn't...
didn't
amount
to
much,
if...
if
it
even
existed
20
or
25
years
ago?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
it
need
not,
but
it
has
chosen
to
do
so,
and
the...
the
question,
i
guess,
before
us
is,
under
skidmore
deference,
is
that
a
reasonable
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you...
are
you
basing
your
estimate
of
what
the
eeoc
would
cover
on
the
materials
set
forth
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
9?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
they
have
many
people
working
for
them,
they
won't
be
subject
to
the
small
business
exception.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
there
are
no...
if
they're
not
protected,
they
have
no
claim
to
make.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
with...
with
malpractice,
don't
you
have
a
much
greater
likelihood
of
punitive
damages
and
things
like
that,
that
you
don't
have
arising
just
out
of
a
contract
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
crispin.
mr.
seymour,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
seymour.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-1435,
clackamas
gastroenterology
associates
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
