justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the...
the
reason
we
said
it
was
that
we
couldn't
find
any
basis
in
the
statutory
history
or
the
text
that...
that
gave
us
a
clue
that
congress,
in
effect,
wanted
to
ignore
something
which
is
such
hornbook
law.
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
i
think,
is
that
there
is
a
reason
to
think
congress
would
want
to
look
at...
at
nontraditional
concepts
here.
the
argument
is
that
the
common
law
definition
of
employee
does
not
axiomatically
apply
because
it's
not
addressing
the
issue
that
congress
was
addressing
in
that...
in
this
statute.
the
issue
that
congress
was
addressing
in
this
statute,
as
i
understand
the
argument,
in
fact
taking
the...
the
very
words
that
mr.
gornstein
used
a
moment
ago,
was
the
issue
of
protecting
people
who
can
be
hurt
by
discrimination.
it
was
a
protection
issue.
so
that
i
think
what
he's
saying,
and...
and
what
the
petitioner's
counsel
are
saying
is,
the
one
thing
that
we
do
know
about
employees
is
that
they
were
people
who
were
intended
to
be
protected
by
this
statute.
if
that
is
true,
it
is
not
probable
that
they
were
trying
to
include
as
employees,
the
protected
category,
people
who
don't
need
protection
because
they
are
in
ultimate
control
of
the
business,
the
ones
who,
if
there's
going
to
be
discrimination,
are
going
to
be
doing
the
discriminating,
so
it's
probable
that
the
people
who
have
that
ultimate
control
would
intend
it
to
be
within
the
employee
category.
that's
an
issue
that
the
common
law
didn't
address.
how
do
you
respond
to
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying,
even
on
the
premise
of
their
argument,
it
does
not
exclude
any
one
of
the
four.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
suppose
if
one
of
the
four
had
a
51
percent,
a
truly
indefeasibly
controlling
interest,
you'd
concede
that,
but
short
of
that,
which
apparently
is
not
the
case
here,
you
say,
even
if
i
take
their
premises,
they
lose.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what...
why
would
they
be
doing
this?
i
mean,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
secretaries
won't
work
for
the
corporation
unless
they
know
it's
covered
under
this
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
mean,
is
it
a
realistic
possibility?
i
mean,
are
people
making
employment
decisions
depending
on
whether
they...
they're
going
to
be
able
to
sue
if
there
is
discrimination
likely?
