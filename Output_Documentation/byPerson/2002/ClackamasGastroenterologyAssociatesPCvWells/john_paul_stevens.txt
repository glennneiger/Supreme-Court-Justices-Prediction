justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
hear
you.
i
couldn't
hear
the
response.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
but
isn't
there
a
huge
difference,
that
they've
got
limited
liability?
if
you
have...
the
corporation
is
liable
if
you
have,
you're
incorporated?
isn't
that
the
true
with
your
case,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
in
partnership,
the
individuals
are
liable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say
you're
not
an
employee,
but
isn't
that
the
question
we
have
to
decide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
every
partner...
no
partner
is
ever
an
employee.
you're
not
suggesting
that,
are
you?
say
you've
got
a
law
firm
that's
got
250
partners,
you're
going
to
say
none
of
them
are...
are
employees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
application
of
your
test?
you...
you
urge
us
to
remand
the
case,
as
i
understand
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
answer
the
question
whether
these
individuals
operate
independently
and
manage
and
control
the
business
on
the
one
hand,
or
are
subject
to
the
organization's
control
on
the
other,
and
i
ask
you,
is
it
not
possible
that
the
same
individual
could
meet
both
halves
of
that
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
some
of
his
duties,
he'd
be
manager,
and
some
others
he'd
have
to
respond
to
what
the
group
told
him
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
do
if
you
find
such
a
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
respect
to
surgery,
he
takes
orders
from
the
directors.
with
respect
to
advising
patients,
he's
on...
on
his
own.
justice
john
paul
stevens
respondent
deborah
wells
was
employed
by
a
petitioner
in
oregon
medical
clinic
that
is
organized
as
a
professional
corporation.
after
her
termination,
she
brought
this
action
against
petitioner
alleging
unlawful
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
disability
under
title
i
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
petitioner
moved
for
summary
judgment
asserting
that
was
not
covered
by
the
act
because
it
did
not
have
15
or
more
employees.
the
accuracy
of
that
assertion
depends
on
whether
the
four
doctors
who
serve
as
the
clinic's
four
director
shareholders
are
counted
as
employees.
relying
on
an
economic
reliaties
test,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
four
director
shareholders
were
analogous
to
partners
in
the
partnership
and
therefore
were
not
employees.
on
appeal,
the
divided
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
use
of
any
corporation
including
a
professional
corporation
precludes
an
examination
to
determine
whether
the
entity
is
in
fact
a
partnership.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
though,
the
ada
does
not
helpfully
define
the
term
"employee",
the
statute
says
that
an
employee
is
an
individual
employed
by
an
employer.
our
cases,
construing
that
term
in
other
context,
tell
us
to
look
to
common-law
agency
doctrine
when
filling
the
gap
in
the
statutory
text.
particularly
helpful
is
the
common-law's
definition
of
the
master-servant
relationship
which
focuses
on
the
master's
control
over
the
servant.
in
accord
with
the
common-law's
focus
on
the
element
of
control
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
has
adopted
specific
guidelines
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
a
director
shareholder
is
an
employee
subject
to
a
firm's
control
or
a
person
who
operates
independently
and
manages
a
business.
we
are
persuaded
by
the
eeoc's
guidelines
and
by
its
focus
on
the
common-law
touchstone
of
control.
accordingly,
we
have
decided
to
send
to
case
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
consider
whether
the
four
doctors
are
employees
of
the
clinic
in
light
of
the
eeoc's
guidelines.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
breyer
joins.
