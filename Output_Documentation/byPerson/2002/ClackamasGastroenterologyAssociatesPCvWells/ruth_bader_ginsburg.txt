--but
this
was
a
case
where
it
was
very
important
to
the
shareholders
in
this
corporation
that
they
be
labeled
employees
for
erisa
purposes.
it
had
to
be...
if
they
weren't
employees,
they
weren't
going
to
be
able
to
get
themselves
covered
under
the
retirement
plan
as
the
law
then
was,
so
in...
in
the
erisa
context
you
would
be
saying,
of
course
they're
employees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
wouldn't...
on
your
theory,
they're
not...
so
they
are
employees
for
that
purpose?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the...
the
whole
thing
was
set
up
the
way
it
was,
instead
of
as
a
partnership,
for
the
reason
that
these
people
needed
to
be
characterized
as
employees
for
retirement
plan
purposes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
are
they
not
also
employees
for
worker's
compensation
purposes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they'd
have
to
opt
out.
they
start
out
by
being
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
start
out
as
being...
do
they
get
salaries?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
get
salaries.
there's
nothing
inconsistent
with
being,
say,
the
president
of
the
company
and
principal
shareholder
and
being
both
an
owner
and
an
employee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the...
that
the
individual
liability
is
not
across
the
board,
but
it's
only
for
malpractice-type
claims?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
other
claims
against
the
clinic,
it...
they...
they
would
have
limited
liability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
there
isn't...
there
isn't
any
settled
law,
is
there,
that
a
limited
liability
partnership
would
not
be
treated
the
same
way
that
this
entity
is...
is
treated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
the
court
say
the
eeoc
doesn't
get
such
deference?
i
mean,
didn't...
wasn't
that
way
back
in
the
gilbert
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
would
be
kind
of
a
skidmore
deference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
it
simpler
just
to
say,
well,
they
picked
a
corporate
form
with
their
eyes
open
because
it
was
important
for
them
to
be
labeled
employees,
at
least
for
retirement
purposes,
so
they
have
to
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet.
they
got
that
qualification
so
they
could
have
their
retirement
plans,
and
then
it's
just
much
simpler
to
say,
that's
the
form
that
they
chose,
and
the
law
for
many...
in
many
contexts
does
follow
what...
the
form
parties
choose
for
their
arrangement.
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
answer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
respond
to
the
famous
two
clinic
examples,
one
is
set
up
as
a
partnership
and
one
is
a
professional
corporation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
making
a
distinction
between
owner-directors
who
are
also
working
every
day
providing
the
services
of
the
entity,
and
owner-directors
who
are
not
involved
in
the
day-to-day
service
delivery
function
of
the
enterprise?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
you
say
the
director
gets
a
fee,
and
the
meetings
are
not
frequent
but
the
director
is
expected
to
remain
au
courant
with
what's
going
on
in
the
business,
so
how
do
we
judge
that?
we
can't
say,
only
the...
for
the
hour
of
the
meeting
that
director
counts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
event,
the
director,
the
owner-directors,
shareholder-directors
that
we
have
here
are
working
for
the
corporation
every
day,
and
they
are
on
salary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
that
small,
when
you're
talking
about
a
professional
medical
corporation?
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
be
the
biggest
liability,
not
the
small--
