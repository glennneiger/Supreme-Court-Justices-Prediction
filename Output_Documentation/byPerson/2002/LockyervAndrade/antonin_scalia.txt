scalia
but
if
we
know
what
the
rule
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
have
to
know
what
it
is.
the
question
is,
is
there
a
clearly
pronounced
federal
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
answer
to
that
may
well
be
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
which
case
we
have
no
occasion
to
pronounce
on
what
the
federal
rule
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
we
have
to
say
is
that
there
is
no
clearly
enunciated
federal
rule
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
century
of
decisions?
i
thought
we
decided
this
since
i've
been
on
the
court.
i've
been
here
longer
than
i
thought,
i
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
there...
for
a
century
we
have
been
engaged
in
proportionality
analysis?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
california
courts
contradict
that?
did
the
california
courts
here
say,
grossly
disproportionate
crimes
don't
violate
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
he
have
that
record
before
him?
isn't
there
a
presentence,
equivalent
of
a
presentencing
report?
doesn't
he
get
the
record
of
what
this
person
he's
about
to
sentence
has
done
in
the
past?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
only
the
burglaries
were
mentioned
in
the
presentencing
report?
justice
antonin
scalia
were
proven?
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
was
not
the
court's
test,
that
was
justice
kennedy's
test,
which
you
say
was
the
lowest
common
denominator.
you
think
it's
clearly
established
law
that
where
you
have
a
split
decision,
the
lowest
common
denominator
is
the
law
of
the
land?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
a
highly
controverted
proposition
myself.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
an
opinion
of
the
court,
an
opinion
of
justice
kennedy,
and
you
say
that
all
the
states'
courts
have
to
accept
the
proposition
that
that
is
the
law
of
the
land?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
justice
powell's
opinion
in
bakke
is
the
law
of
the
land,
and
you
think
that
that
is
generally
accepted?
justice
antonin
scalia
understood.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
point
is
that
the
proposition
is
not,
is
simply
not
well-established,
that
you
must
accept
a
less
than
majority
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
as
being
the
law
of
the
land
so
long
as
it's
the
lowest
common
denominator.
