mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
today,
the
state
of
california
asks
this
court
to
disregard
and
essentially
to
overrule
a
century
of
decisions
that
have
held
that
grossly
disproportionate
penalties
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
if
any
sentence
is
grossly
disproportionate,
it's
that
which
was
imposed
on
leandro
andrade.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia,
i
didn't
hear
the
question.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
your
honor.
in
weems
v.
united
states
in
1910,
this
court
said
that
sentences
must
be
graduated
in
proportion
to
the
offense.
most
recently,
in
harmelin
v.
michigan,
seven
justices...
and
justice
kennedy's
opinion
becomes
the
rule
of
harmelin...
prescribed
a
three-part
test
based
on
solem
v.
helm
for
deciding
if
a
sentence
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
chief
justice
rehnquist,
each
of
the
cases
said
it's
consistent
with
all
of
the
cases,
and
each
of
these
cases
cites
to
weems
v.
united
states
as
saying
that
grossly
disproportionate
punishments
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
many
state
courts,
and
virtually
every
circuit
has
said
that
justice
kennedy's
opinion
from
harmelin
becomes
the
rule
of
harmelin,
because
in
united
states
v.
marks
it
was
the
narrowest
ground
that
a
majority
agreed
to,
and
of
course
justice
kennedy's
opinion
is
simply
a
modification
of
the
three-part
solem
test.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes,
your
honor.
under
this
court's
decision
in
williams
v.
taylor,
in
bell
v.
cone
and
yes,
in
early
v.
packer,
there
are
two
ways
in
which
a
federal
court
can
grant
habeas
relief.
one
is
to
find
that
it
is
contrary
to
clearly
established
federal
law.
the
other
is
to
find
that
it's
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law.
both
are
present
here,
and
all--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
there
are
cases
prior
to
solem
that
found
sentences
to
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
in
robinson
v.
california
in
1962,
for
example--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes,
your
honor,
and
it
did
find
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no.
my
point,
your
honor,
is
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
grossly
disproportionate
sentences
violate
the
eighth
amendment,
and
the
cases
that
i
mentioned
say
that.
in
addition--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes,
your
honor,
and
what
i'm
simply
saying
is,
these
are
examples
which
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
grossly
disproportionate
sentences
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
your
honor.
the
california
court
of
appeals,
and
you
find
this
in
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition,
said
it
questioned
whether
gross
disproportionality
analysis
would
be
applied,
and
it
questioned
whether
solem
v.
helm
analysis
applied,
and
therefore
the
california
court
of
appeals
did
not
apply
the
three-part
test
from
solem
v.
helm
and
the
three-part
test
that
comes
from
justice
kennedy's
opinion
in
harmelin.
and
in
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
it
is
those
cases
that
announce
the
test
that
should
have
been
applied,
and
those
cases
are
clearly
established
law.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--i
do
disagree.
first,
the
california
court
of
appeal
expressly
said
it
was
not
going
to
do
gross
disproportionality
analysis.
it
did
not
do
solem
analysis.
it
did
not
do
harmelin
analysis.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor.
the
california
court
of
appeal
said
the
test
under
california
law
is
whether
the
sentence,
quote,
shocks
the
conscience.
that
is
a
quite
different
test
than
the
objective
test
of
solem
and
harmelin,
which
is
carefully
calibrated
determining
whether
a
sentence
is
grossly
disproportionate.
also,
the
three
factors
used
by
the
california
court
of
appeal
under
the
lynch
analysis
were
quite
different
than
the
solem
analysis.
first,
there
was
no
comparison
of
the
gravity
of
the
offense
to
the
harshness
of
the
punishment.
second,
the
court
did
not
look
to
similar
punishments
in
the
same
jurisdiction.
in
california,
the
punishment
for
rape
would
have
been
8
years
in
prison,
the
punishment
for
manslaughter
would
have
been
11
years
in
prison,
the
punishment
for
second
degree
murder
would
have
been
15
years
in
prison,
and
he
received
50
years
to
life.
in
fact,
if
his
prior
offenses
had
been
rape
and
murder,
he
could
have
at
most
gotten
a
year
in
jail.
this
goes
to
justice
stevens'
question
earlier.
his
prior...
his
crime
here
was
the
misdemeanor
of
shoplifting.
because
of
double-counting
it
was
elevated
first
to
petty
theft
with
a
prior,
and
then
it
triggered
the
three
strikes
law,
but
in
order
for
it
to
be
petty
theft
with
a
prior,
there
has
to
be
a
prior
property
offense.
if
his
prior
crimes
had
been
rape
and
murder,
then
his
maximum
sentence
for
stealing
these
videotapes
would
have
been
a
year
in
jail.
it's
because
his
prior
offenses
were
property
crimes
that
the
double-counting
could
occur.
additionally--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor.
the
confusion
here
is
that
with
regard
to
petty
theft,
petty
theft,
the
misdemeanor
can
become
the
wobbler
petty
theft
with
a
prior
under
california
penal
code
section
666
only
if
the
prior
crime
is
a
property
crime,
and
if
you
look
at
california
penal
code
section
66,
it
enumerates
just
property
crimes.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
your
honor.
they
used
a
petty
theft,
but
they
also
used
the
burglaries
to
convert
the
petty
theft
to
a
petty
theft
with
a
prior,
and
then
they
used
the
petty
theft
with
a
prior
to
trigger
the
three
strikes
law.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
that
is
correct.
however,
your
honor,
under
california
penal
code
section
667(g)
any
prior
felonies
must
be
pled
and
proven,
and
the
only
prior
felonies
here
that
were
ever
mentioned
were
the
burglaries,
and
as
a
result,
simply
because
of
stealing
$152
worth
of
videotapes
in
those
burglaries,
he
received
a
sentence
of
50
years
to
life,
and
under
the
third
prong
of
the
rule
of--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor,
they
played
no
role
in
the
sentence
here,
and
the
reason,
as
i
said,
is
the
california
penal
code
says
any
prior
felonies
must
be
pled
and
proven.
if
you
look
at
the
felony
complaint--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
this
is
not
what
occurred
here.
if
you
look
at
the
sentencing
transcript
on
page
37
of
the
joint
appendix,
you'll
see
that
the
sentencing
judge
made
no
mention
to
anything
other
than
the
three
burglaries.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor,
because
california
penal
code
requires
an
order,
for
it
to
be
considered
a
strike,
it
has
to
be
pled
and
proven.
the
criminal
complaint
here,
the
criminal
information,
the
jury
finding
was
just
as
to
those
burglaries,
and
the
sentencing
judge
focused
it
just
on
those
burglaries.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
there's
no--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--indication
here
that
there
was
ever
any
consideration
other
than
the
burglaries.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
there
was
a
probation
report,
but
because
under
california
law
prior
strikes
have
to
be
pled
and
proven,
because
only
the
burglaries
were
mentioned,
there's
no
reason
here
for
the
judge--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no.
only
the
burglaries
were
proven.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
the
jury,
on
pages
18
and
19
of
the
joint
appendix,
found
the
burglaries,
thus
there
was
no
reason
for
andrade
to
challenge
the
contents
of
the
probation
report,
and
the
judge
never
mentioned
the
probation
report.
he
focused
just
on
the
burglaries.
and
the
other
thing
that
makes
this
case,
i
think,
quite
unique
is
no
other
state
in
the
country
would
impose
a
punishment
like
this
on
andrade.
the
solicitor
general's
brief
points
to
some
instances
where
in
essence
grand
theft,
stealing
more
than
$400
has
led
to
a
sentence.
the
state
can't
identify,
and
there
is
no
instance
where
anybody
else
has
received
this
sentence.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
justice
breyer,
the
reason
this
case
is
different
is
the
underlying
conduct
here
is
a
misdemeanor
that's
double-counted
in
order
to
become
the
basis
for
a
life
sentence.
earlier,
for
example,
justice
scalia
even
invoked
the
distinction
between
misdemeanor
and
felony.
a
key
point
here
is,
there
is
no
limiting
principle
that--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
because
that
could
lead
to
an
indeterminate
life
sentence
for
stealing
a
candy
bar
or
even
a
gum
ball.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
and
that
would
violate--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--it
is
not
subjective,
it
is
the
three-part
objective
test
that
is
the
rule
of
harmelin.
it
is
first
comparing
the
gravity
of
the
offense
to
the
harshness
of
the
punishment.
in
solem
v.
helm,
this
court
said
the
courts
can
evaluate
the
gravity
of
the
offense,
looking
to
see
if
it's
a
violent
versus
a
nonviolent
offense.
leandro
andrade
never
committed
any
violent
offense.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
of
course.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
it
is,
and
recidivists
can--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but
leandro
andrade
never
was
accused
or
convicted
of
breaking
and
entering
with
knives
and
in
fact,
your
honor,
even
if
you
look
at
all
of
his
offenses,
his
criminal
pattern
is
virtually
identical
to
that
of
helm
in
solem
v.
helm.
i
would
go
back
to
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--first,
your
honor,
as
i
said
before,
there's
no
indication
that
those
were
ever
considered,
nor
could
they
be
by
the
sentencing
court,
but
second,
your
honor,
even
if
you
consider
all
of
those,
then
his
criminal
record
is
virtually
identical
to
helm's
in
solem
v.
helm,
and
this
does
go
to
chief
justice
rehnquist's
initial
question.
one
way
that
this
court
has
said
that
you
can
find
that
a
penalty
or
a
sentence
is
contrary
to
clearly
established
federal
law
is
if
a
state
court
ignores
a
decision
that
is
on
all
fours.
solem
v.
helm--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
in
solem
v.
helm
it
was
a
life
sentence,
but
there's
nothing
in
solem
or
harmelin
that
indicates
that
disproportionality
analysis
is
only
where
there's
no
possibility
of
parole.
if
that
were
the
analysis,
then
a
state
could
avoid
disproportionality
review
just
by
calling
every
life
without
possibility
of
parole
a
75-year
sentence.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
solem
v.
helm
answers
that
question.
here,
leandro
andrade
received
an
indeterminate
life
sentence
with
no
possibility
of
parole
for
50
years.
that
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
sentence
that
helm
received
in
solem
v.
helm,
and
yet
the
california
court
of
appeal
expressly
said
it
would
not
apply
solem
v.
helm.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor.
the
reason
is,
two
things
were
clearly
established
at
the
time
the
california
court
of
appeal
decision
came
down,
first,
that
grossly
disproportionate
sentences
violate
the
eighth
amendment,
and
the
court
said
it
questioned
it,
didn't
apply
it,
and
second,
the
test
that's
supposed
to
be
used,
the
objective
test
from
the
rule
of
harmelin...
from
solem
v.
helm,
and
the
court
did
not
apply
that
three-part
test,
and
in
that
way
the
court
acted
contrary
to
clearly
established
law.
also,
since
solem
v.
helm
is
really
factually
indistinguishable
in
this
case,
the
court
acted
contrary
to
in
not
following,
and
in
addition--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes,
your
honor,
at
least
with...
insofar
as
gross
disproportionality
violates
the
eighth
amendment,
and
the
test
for
gross
disproportionality
being
clearly
established,
and
the
california
courts
followed
neither
of
those.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
in
two
ways.
first,
the
three-part
test
that
it
prescribes
is
still
followed,
though
justice
kennedy's
opinion
from
harmelin
says
there's
only
a
need
to
consider
the
latter
two
prongs
if
there
is
an
inference
of
gross
disproportionality
comparing
the
gravity
of
the
offense
to
the
harshness
of
the
punishment.
and
second,
no
subsequent
case,
including
harmelin,
has
ever
ruled,
overruled
solem
v.
helm,
so--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
unreasonable
here,
because
the
california
court
of
appeal
applied
only
rummel,
but
in
footnote
32
in
solem,
the
court
said
that
rummel
is
confined
to
its
facts,
because
it's
before
the
three-part
test.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
and
rummel
remains
good
law
insofar
as
result,
but
harmelin
affirms
the
three-part
test.
this
court
has
repeatedly
affirmed
that
three-part
test.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
that's
correct,
your
honor--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--this
is
that
rare
case,
because
in
this
instance,
a
man
who
had
never
committed
a
violent
crime
received
an
indeterminate
life
sentence
with
no
possibility
of
parole
for
50
years
for
stealing
a
small
amount
of
videotapes.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
i
think,
your
honor,
that
there
is
very
little
likelihood,
based
on
all
of
the
california
cases,
that
a
resentencing
would
lead
to
a
different
result
here,
so
in
that
sense
i
agree
with
you,
and
that's
why
it
really
is
a
constitutional
issue.
does
an
indeterminate
life
sentence
for
this
conduct,
even
taking
into
account
his
recidivism,
justify
the
penalty
that
was
received
here?
this
court
has
prescribed
exactly
the
objective
factors
to
be
considered,
and
to
treat
stealing
$153
worth
of
videotapes
more
seriously
than
second
degree
murder
doesn't
even
meet
a
rational
basis
test,
and
it
is
an
unreasonable
application,
and
in
that
way,
this
case--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--based
on
three
burglaries
that
were
13
years
earlier,
and
twice
shoplifting
a
small
amount
of
videotapes,
and
that's
why
our
argument
is
that
this
is
that
rare
case
where
it
is
grossly
disproportionate
punishment
to
in
essence--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--it
is
correct
that
this
court
has
not
found
any
sentence
to
be
grossly
disproportionate
since
harmelin...
you've
not
dealt
with
this
issue
since
harmelin...
but
there
are
lower
court
cases.
for
example,
a
year
ago
the
eighth
circuit
in
henderson
v.
norris
found
a
life
sentence
for
possessing
a
small
amount
of
cocaine
was
grossly
disproportionate,
applying
the
rule
of
harmelin
and
also
applying
the
solem
v.
helm
test.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
i
don't
think
it
was
a
recidivist
case,
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
there
are
state
courts
that
have
found
recidivist
sentencing
structures
to
violate
united
states
constitution,
but
there
are
not...
then
those
would
also
involve
recidivists,
and
those
would
have
applied
both
solem
and
helm.
the
west
virginia
court
in
state
v.
deal,
for
example,
found
a
recidivist
sentencing
structure
to
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
the
colorado
court
of
appeals
in
people
v.
gaskins
came
to
the
same
result,
and
that
also
explains
why
this
case
is
different
than
early
v.
packer,
which
you
decided
yesterday,
and
there
the
criticism
was
that
it
was
a
situation
where
the
state
court
didn't
cite
to
or
mention
the
controlling
supreme
court
decision.
here,
the
california
supreme
court
said
it
was
rejecting
the
test
prescribed
by
this
court,
rejecting
the
test
from
harmelin
v.
michigan,
which
is
a
very
different
situation
than
this
case.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
your
honor.
the
exact
wording
from
the
court
was
the
question.
the
exact
wording
was,
and
i
quote
to
you
from
page
76
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition,
however,
to
the
extent
that
the
defendant
suggests
that
proportionality
analysis
applies
under
both
the
state
and
federal
constitutions,
we
must
question
that
assertion,
and
then
the
court
said,
on
the
same
page,
the
current
validity
of
the
solem
proportionality
analysis
is
questionable.
and
having
said
it
was
questionable,
the
court
then
did
not
apply
the
rule
that
grossly
disproportionate
sentences
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
the
court
did
not
apply
the
solem
analysis,
the
rule
of
harmelin
that
the
court
identified
in
harmelin
v.
michigan,
and
it
was
the
failure
of
the
court
to
apply
the
controlling
test,
it
was
the
failure
of
the
court
to
follow
the
controlling
precedent--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--that
made
the
decision
contrary.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
but
your
honor,
they
then
did
not
apply
the
three-part
test
that
justice
kennedy
articulated,
which
is
the
rule
of
harmelin--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--well,
they
didn't--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
they
didn't
use
in
any
way
the
three-part
test
from
harmelin.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
all
they
did
was
analogize
to
rummel
v.
estelle.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
in
united
states--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
in
united
states
v.
marks
this
court
described
how
to
determine
the
rule
when
there
is
no
majority
opinion,
but
especially
here,
where
justice
kennedy
is
simply
slightly
modifying
a
prior
test
from
solem
v.
helm,
the
law
is
clearly
established.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
virtually
every
circuit
has
said
that
is
the
rule
of
harmelin,
but
especially
so
here,
where
it
is
simply
slightly
modifying
a
test
that's
been
on
the
books
for
20
years,
since
solem
v.
helm,
that
says
three
considerations
are
used
to
calibrate
whether
a
sentence
is
cruel
and
unusual.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
my
sense
is
you're
going
to
have
occasion
soon
enough
to
deal
with
that
issue--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but--
[laughter]
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
i
think
there's
three
reasons
why
it
is.
first,
this
court's
opinion
in
united
states
v.
marks
describes
how
to
determine
what
the
holding
is.
second,
every
circuit...
and
we
cite
this
in
our
brief...
refers
to
the
rule
of
harmelin,
and
virtually
every
state
that's
considered
it
refers
to
the
rule
of
harmelin,
which
shows
that
it's
clearly
established.
and
third,
the
solem
v.
helm
test
was
not
in
any
way
overruled.
seven
justices
in
this
court
in
harmelin
adhered
to
the
solem
test.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
but
seven
justices--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor.
seven
justices
agreed
that
grossly
disproportionate
sentences
violate
the
constitution.
four
would
apply
an
even
more
protective
standard
for
criminal
defendants,
but
seven
justices
clearly
adhered
to
that.
seven
justices
adhered
to
the
solem
v.
helm
test.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
often
justices
will
disagree,
but
the
question
here
is,
is
the
rule
clearly
established,
and
the
rule
that
grossly
disproportionate
sentences
violate
the
constitution,
the
rule
that
there's
an
objective
three-part
test,
is
what
is
the
clearly
established
law,
and
your
honor,
if
any
sentence
is
grossly
disproportionate,
it's
this
case.
the
punishment
here
isn't
just
cruel
and
unusual,
it's
cruel
and
unique.
the
state
can't
point
to
even
one
other
person
in
this
history
of
the
united
states
who
has
received
a
sentence
of
50
years
to
life
for
shoplifting
a
small
amount
of
merchandise.
even
in
california
this
sentence
would
be
regarded
as
quite...
much
larger
than,
say,
second
degree
murder,
manslaughter,
rape,
which
shows
that
it
is
a
grossly
disproportionate
punishment.
thank
you.
