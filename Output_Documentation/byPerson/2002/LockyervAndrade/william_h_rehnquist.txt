chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
01-1127,
bill
lockyer
v.
leandro
andrade.
mr.
danzig.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
the
case
in
which
the
ninth
circuit
first
decided
for
itself
the
constitutional
question,
and
then
decided
whether
the
state
court
had
reasonably
applied
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
also
inconsistent
with
our
idea
that
we
try
to
avoid
constitutional
questions
if
we
can,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
california
fine
people
for
jay-walking?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
enforced
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
danzig--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
wish
to
reserve
some
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
thank
you,
mr.
danzig.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chemerinsky,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
don't
think
that's
quite
accurate,
mr.
chemerinsky.
i
think
if
you
were
to
take
points,
decisional
points,
you
would
look
at
rummel
on
one
side,
and
then
solem
moves
away
from
that,
and
then
harmelin
moves
back
towards
rummel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
as
a
state
court
judge
trying
to
apply
our
cases
when
you
take
those
three
cases?
i
mean,
it
isn't
a
very
obvious
answer,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it...
justice...
i've
just
read
it
over,
and
it
cites
rummel
more
often
than
it
cites
solem.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
point
that
i
think
you
need
to
address
is
the
aedpa
point.
that
is,
is
the
supreme
court
of
california
way
out
of
line,
or
whatever
the
test
is,
you
know,
improperly
applied--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
the
light
of
these
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
opponent
says
that
the
california
court
relied
on
a
lynch
analysis,
which
is
a
state
court
doing
much
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
disagree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
realize
that,
and
my
question
to
you
was,
if
the
california
court
said
we're
going
to
do
a
lynch
analysis,
is
that
substantially
the
same
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
your
opponent,
or
perhaps
the
representative
of
the
state,
said
that
was
not
so.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you...
mr.
chemerinsky,
do
you...
do
you
think
that
solem
v.
helm
was
as
strong
a
case
after
our
decision
in
harmelin
as
it
was
before?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
do
you
think
a
state
court
judge
is
acting
unreasonably
if
he
says
we
have
three
cases,
rummel,
solem,
and
harmelin,
and
it
just
isn't
quite
all
that
clear?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
then
harmelin
goes
ahead
and,
as
i
say,
cites
rummel
more
often
than
it
does
solem.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--they
say,
mr.
chemerinsky,
on
that
same
page,
they
say
that
the
solem
proportionality
analysis
is
questionable
in
the
light
of
harmelin
v.
michigan.
they
certainly
weren't
saying
they
were
refusing
to
apply
harmelin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
said
they
simply
refused
to
follow
harmelin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i...
you're
not
meaning,
then,
that
they
expressly
refused
to
follow
harmelin,
you're
saying
that,
in
fact,
they
didn't
use
the
same
formula
as
harmelin
suggested?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
split
4
to
3
as
to
what
the
test
required
in
that
case,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you...
doesn't
that
throw
some
doubt
as
to
how
closely
you
follow
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
doesn't
that
suggest
that
the
test
isn't
that
clear
if
they
apply
it
and
three
come
out
one
way
and
four
come
out
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
chemerinsky.
mr.
danzig,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
danzig.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
