suppose
we
were
to
find...
and
there's
argument
in
this
about
the
briefs
both
ways,
but
suppose
we
were
to
conclude
that
this
has
likely
been
a
most
effective
scheme,
that
it's
reduced
the
crime
rate
in
the
state
of
california.
the
prisoners
talk
about
it
all
the
time.
they
know
what
three
strikes
means.
it's
a
simple
thing
that
they
can
understand,
and
that
it
works.
if
we
made
that
finding,
and
there...
your
adversaries
will
disagree
that
that's
true,
but
if
we
made
that
finding,
does
that
bear
on
whether
the
sentence
is
disproportionate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
this
particular
case
it's
50
years
for
stealing
some
tapes,
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
light
of
the
answer
that
you
gave
to
my
question,
and
then
to
justice
o'connor's
about
what
is
the
standard,
i'm
now
at
somewhat
a
loss
as
to
how
to
defend
your
statute
under
the
incapacitation
and
deterrence
theory.
that
doesn't
bear
on
proportionality?
that's
quite
a
surprising
answer
to
me.
i
thought
the
whole
point
of
this
statute
was
that
we
wanted
something
that
works.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
proportionality
has
to
be
judged
against
the
legislative
objective,
i
should
think.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
then
the
question
that
i
put
to
you
does
bear
on
proportionality.
the
premise
i
put
to
you
does
bear
on
proportionality,
that
we
need
a
system
that's
simple
but
works,
that
reduces
crime
in
the
state,
and
you
told
me,
oh,
well,
that
means
we
could
lock
up
everything,
everybody
so
you
can't
use
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
don't
lock
up
everybody.
that's
not
the
three
strikes
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
danzig--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
object
to
that
relief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
he
presumed
to
know
what
the
record
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
no.
no.
that's
true
as
to
the
strikes,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
didn't
notice
the
entire
record
in
order
to
inform
his
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
her.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there's
no
indication
that
the
record
was
not
before
the
judge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
that,
there's
nothing
in
harmelin
as
i
reread
it
that
indicates
that
you
must
preclude
or
prescind
from
that
analysis,
that
initial
analysis,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
recidivist
element
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
recidivism
is
part
of
the
analysis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we're
not
just
talking
about
gum
balls.
we're
talking
about
all
of
the
offenses,
including
breaking
and
entering
with
knives
and
so
forth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
under
the
three
strikes
regime?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
doesn't
tell
us
much
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
three
strikes
regime.
