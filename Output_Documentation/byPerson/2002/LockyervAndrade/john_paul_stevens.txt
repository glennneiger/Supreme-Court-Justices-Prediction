justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
on
that
point,
do
you
think
there
was
not
even
the
need
to
look
at
the
second
or
third
elements
of
the
test
because
there
is
not
even
a
basis
for
saying
this
sentence
was
grossly
disproportionate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
the
case
could
be
decided
on
the
ground
that
there's...
an
inference
of
gross
disproportionality
should
not
be
drawn
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
just
refresh
my
recollection
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
the
prior
argument,
the
argument
was
made
that
violence
was
the
critical
matter
in
the
prior
conviction.
were
there
violence
in
the
earlier,
in
the
priors
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
with
your
colleague
in
the
prior
case
that
violence
is
a
critical
element
in
the
priors
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
seem
to
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they're
consecutive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
isn't
that
50?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
he
being
punished
because
he's
a
heroin
addict
or
because
he
stole
these
tapes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
said
earlier
that
you
thought
the
proper
analysis
was
contrary
to,
rather
than
unreasonable
application,
and
how
can
you
decide
whether
something's
contrary
to
a
rule
unless
you
know
what
the
rule
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
you've
answered
my
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
to
decide
whether
or
not...
regardless
of
what
the
ninth
circuit
did,
i
think
one
of
the
things
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
or
not
the
sentence
in
this
case
is
contrary
to
a
federal
rule,
and
i
don't
know
how
we
can
decide
that
without
knowing
what
the
federal
rule
is,
and
i
was
asking
for
your
advice
on
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
have
to
identify
that
as
the
federal
rule
before
we
go
on
to
decide
whether
it's
contrary
to,
i
think.
is
that...
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
don't
understand
why
a
parking
offense
wouldn't
qualify
if
a
man
is
on
parole,
and
any
breach
of
parole
is
always
emphasized
as
being
particularly
bad,
and
one
of
the
things
he
can't
do
is
engage
in
parking
in
no-parking
zones,
and
if
he
did
that
in
breach
of
a
parole,
and
he
had
nine
prior
cases,
i
don't
know
why
you
couldn't
impose
your
three-strike
penalty
on
the
overtime
parker.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says,
any
violation...
it
put
it
in
as
a
wobbler,
any
violation
of
a
parole
condition
by
a
person
who's
on
parole.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not,
because
the
other,
in
the
other
case
they
emphasized
the
fact
he'd
been
on
parole
a
number
of
times,
what...
his
violations
were
parole
violations.
is
the
fact
that
whether
or
not
it's
a
parole
violation
relevant
to
our
inquiry
at
all?
