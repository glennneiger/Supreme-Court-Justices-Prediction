limiting
principle
here?
justice

one?
justice
sandra

o'connor
--excuse
me,
what
is
your
limiting
principle?
i
haven't
heard
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
also
arises
out
of
california’s
three
strikes
law,
but
this
unlike
the
previous
case,
the
un
case,
comes
here
in
collateral
review,
habeas
review,
rather
than
direct
review
as
the
prior
case,
and
it
comes
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
november
1995,
respondent
leandro
andrade
stole
approximately
a
$150
in
videotapes
from
two
different
k-mart
stores.
because
of
andrade’s
criminal
history,
he
was
charged
with
two
separate
counts
of
petty
theft
with
a
prior
conviction.
after
a
jury
found
him
guilty,
he
was
sentenced
to
two
consecutive
terms
of
25
years
to
life
imprison
under
california’s
three
strikes
law.
the
state
appellate
court
affirmed
andrade’s
sentence.
respondent
then
file
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
alleging
that
the
length
of
this
sentence
violated
the
eighth
amendment
prohibition
against
cruel
on
unusual
punishment.
the
ninth
circuit
granted
the
writ
concluding
that
the
state
court
committed
clear
error
when
it
held
that
the
sentence
did
not
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversethe
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
we
noted
the
outset
that
this
case
comes
before
from
habeas
review.
under
the
statutory
scheme
set
forth
in
the
federal
statutes
that
we
call
aedpa
section
2254(d),
we
may
grant
the
writ
of
habeas
only
if
the
state
court
decision
was
contrary
to
or
involved
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law.
this
federal
law
does
not
require
a
federal
habeas
court
to
adapt
any
one
methodology
in
deciding
whether
a
state
court
prisoner
is
entitled
to
relief
under
2254(d).
in
this
case,
we
do
not
reach
the
question
whether
the
state
court
erred
in
its
decision
and
instead
focused
solely
on
whether
section
2254(d)
forecloses
habeas
relief
on
andrade’s
eighth
amendment
claims.
clearly
established
law
under
section
2254(d)
means
the
governing
legal
principle
or
principle
set
forth
by
this
court
the
supreme
court
at
the
time
that
this
state
court
renders
its
decision.
the
problem
with
andrade’s
position
is
that
our
precedents
in
this
area
have
not
been
a
model
of
clarity.
we
have
not
established
a
clear
or
a
consistent
path
for
lower
courts
to
follow.
through
this
thicket
of
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence,
one
governing
legal
principle
emerges
as
clearly
established.
a
gross
disproportionality
principle
is
applicable
to
sentences
for
terms
of
years.
the
precise
contours
of
this
principle
are
unclear
however
and
it
is
applicable
only
in
the
exceedingly
rare
and
extreme
case.
here
the
state
court
decision
was
neither
contrary
to,
nor
an
unreasonable
application
of
this
clearly
established
gross
disproportionality
principle.
the
decision
was
not
to
contrary
to
our
clearly
established
law.
the
facts
here
fall
in
between
this
court's
cases
in
rummel
versus
estelle
and
solem
versus
helm.
while
this
case
resembles
to
some
degree,
both
rummel
and
solem,
it
is
not
materially
indistinguishable
from
either.
second,
the
state
court
decision
was
not
an
unreasonable
application
of
this
gross
disproportionality
principle.
we
think
the
ninth
circuit
erred
when
it
defined
objectively
unreasonable
to
mean
clear
error.
these
two
standards
are
not
the
same
that
the
loss
of
clear
error
fails
to
give
proper
difference
to
state
courts
by
conflating
error
with
unreasonableness.
here
the
state
court
decision
was
not
objectively
unreasonable
because
the
governing
legal
principle
gives
legislatures
broad
discretion
to
fashion
a
sentence
that
fits
within
the
scope
of
the
proportionality
principle
the
precise
contours
which
are
unclear.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
stevens,
ginsburg,
and
breyer
have
joined.
