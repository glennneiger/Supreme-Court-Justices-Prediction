--okay,
but
if
we
do
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
you're
saying--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
chemerinsky,
the
difficulty
that
i
have
with
your
argument
is,
number
1,
the
point
that
justice
ginsburg
made,
but
a
further
point
that
has
come
out
this
morning.
when
we
are
asking
whether
there
is
clearly
established
law,
i
think
we've
got
to
take
into
consideration
something
that
has
become
clear
from,
i
think
has
become
clear
from
this
argument,
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
the
test
is
genuinely
a
proportionality
or
a
gross
disproportionality
test,
or
whether
that
is
simply
an
example
of
a
kind
of
rational
basis
test,
because
we've
had
this
difficulty
in
fitting
the
recidivism
into
the
structure
of
proportionality
analysis,
and
i
think
what
tends
to
come
out
in
the
answers
that
we've
gotten
this
morning
is,
there's
more
than
just
proportionality
which
is
being
considered
here.
if
that
is
true,
if
that
is
a
fair
characterization
of
the
way
our
reasoning
is
working,
then
don't
we
have
great
difficulty
in
saying
that
there
was
clearly
established
law
simply
by
looking
to
solem
and
to
harmelin?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
that
if
the
law
is
going
to
become
unclear,
it's
going
to
be
as
a
result
of
what
we
say
this
morning,
as...
rather
than
what
we
have
said
before.
