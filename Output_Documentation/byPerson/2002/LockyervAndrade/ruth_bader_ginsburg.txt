justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
we
can
just
back
up,
i
think
you
started
out
by
urging
that
we
not
do
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
in
terms
of
the
order.
it
first
made
a
ruling
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment,
and
then
it
determined
whether
we
had
clearly
established
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
urging
that
we
not
reach
any
ultimate
decision
on
the
eighth
amendment
question,
but
simply
decide
that
however
you
come
out
on
that,
the...
there
was
no
violation
of
clearly
established
federal
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
which...
the
ninth
circuit
said
it's
appropriate
in
these
cases
to
decide
the
eighth
amendment
question
first.
what
is
your
view
on
that?
should
we
follow
in
line
with
what
the
ninth
circuit
did,
or
should
we
say
the
proper
thing
to
do
is
to
find
out
whether
it's
an
unreasonable
interpretation
of
clearly
established
federal
law,
and
if
it
isn't,
that's
the
end
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
seems
just
the
opposite
of
what
you
responded
to
me
earlier,
that
we
don't
have
to
decide
the
eighth
amendment
question,
that
we
can
just
decide
whatever
the
answer
to
that
is,
this
was
not
off
the
chart.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
precisely
we
have
to
ask
whether
there
is
a
federal
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
danzig,
there
is
something
missing
in
this
case
that
was
present
in
the
other.
that
is,
the
judge
in
the...
mr.
ewing's
case
was
asked
to
reduce
the
wobbler
to
a
misdemeanor,
was
asked
to
strike
a
strike
and
she
said
no,
it's
not
within
the
spirit
of
the
three-strikes
law.
here,
the
california
court
of
appeals
seemed
almost
nonplussed
that
there
had
not
been
such
requests
timely
made
to
the
trial
judge,
and
twice
the
court
of
appeal
said
it
would
still
be
open
to
mr.
andrade
to
pursue
on
state
habeas
both
pleas,
that
is,
the
wobbler
should
be
reduced
to
a
misdemeanor,
a
strike
should
be
out.
do
you
agree
that
that
avenue
of
relief
is
open
to
mr.
andrade?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
didn't
repeat
it
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
chemerinsky--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
must
find
in
either
case
clearly
established
federal
law,
and
frankly
that's
my
problem
when
you
cite
weems.
there
are
lots
of
grand
statements
in
our
cases,
but
most
of
them
come
out
rejecting
the
claim,
and
you
cited
weems.
that
was
an
extraordinary
case
because
it
involved
not
simply
hard
labor,
but
hard
and
painful
labor.
it
was
a
kind
of
a
penalty
that
was
foreign
to
anglo-american
law,
and
if
that's
the
one
example
before
we
get
to
solem,
you
really
don't
have
anything
concrete
to
go
on.
you
just
have
grandly
general
statements.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
a
status
crime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
saying,
are
you,
that
being
an
habitual
criminal
is
like
being
a
drug
addict
or
a
drunk?
that
is,
just
being
drunk,
just
being
stoned
on
drugs
is
not
a
crime?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
they
say,
but
you've
given
robinson
as
an
example,
and
that's
a
case
where
i
thought
the
court
said
there
was
no
crime,
not
that
it
was
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
for
a
crime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
chemerinsky,
i
thought
that
what
made
the
petty
theft
in
this
case
into
a
wobbler
was
not
the
crimes
that
were
listed
as
strikes,
but
another
petty
theft.
is
that
not
true?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
they
used...
they
didn't...
there
was
a
second
petty
theft.
that
was
the
crime
of
conviction.
i
thought
there
was
an
earlier
one
that
made
the
crime
of
conviction
the
petty
theft
with
a
prior.
is
that
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
it
not
so
that
a
judge
having
the
two
strikes
that
are
listed,
and
also
having
the
full
record
of
the
crimes
that
this
person
has
committed,
that
that's
relevant
to
the
discretion
the
judge
has
to
strike
a
strike,
or
to
say
i'm
not
going
to
treat
that
petty
theft
as
a
felony,
the
petty
theft
with
prior
as
a
felony.
i'm
not
going
to
do
that.
there
was
in
this
case,
was
there
not,
in
addition
to
the
two
strikes,
some
serious
criminal
activity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
ask
you
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
ones
that
count
as
strikes.
i
asked
you
about
the
sentencing
judge
who
has
discretion
could
say,
looking
at...
if
that's
all
we
had
on
this
record,
i'm
not
going...
i'm
going
to
exercise
my
discretion
to
knock
down
the
wobbler
to
a
misdemeanor.
i'm
going
to
knock
out
a
strike.
isn't
that
in
effect
what
sentencing
judges
would
do?
they
would
look
not
simply
to
the
two
strikes
that
are
formally
pled,
but
this
person's
entire
record.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
that
matter,
what
about
what
judge
sneed
said
in
his
dissent
in
the
ninth
circuit
when
he
pointed
out
that
there
was
much
in
this
criminal
history
record
in
addition
to
the
two
strikes,
including
federal
marijuana
transportation
offenses
and
a
parole
violation
for
escape
from
federal
prison?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
on
all
fours,
on
that
point,
is
there
any
decision
where
a
term
of
years
was
struck
down
as
disproportionate?
solem,
i
take
it,
was
a
life
sentence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
question
is
what's
clearly
established,
and
if
i'm
a
trial
court
judge,
i'll
look
to
see
what
the
court
did,
not
grandly
general
statements
that
it
made
about
constitutional
principle,
and
if
i...
if
my
investigation
led
me
to
find
that
no,
there
has
not
been
a
single
case
in
which
a
term
of
years
has
been
struck
down,
then
i
might
assume
that
the
law
for
terms
of
years
is
not
clearly
established.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
although
it
didn't
apply
it,
although
it
said,
we
don't
have
to
go
beyond
the
first
step,
and
it
said,
you
might
get
to
those
others
in
exceedingly
rare
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
suppose
what
you
are
telling
us
is,
this
is
that
rare
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
this
question
that's...
is
a
practical
one,
is,
in
view
of
what
i
referred
to
before
that
judge
sneed
brought
out
in
his
dissent,
if
any
of
those
other
activities
could
have
been
priors,
wouldn't
a
resentencing
here
likely
yield
the
very
same
result,
except
that
this
time
the
prosecutor
would
spell
out
what
that
entire
course
of
conduct
was?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
wasn't
that
they
were
treating
this
person
as
someone
whose
prior
record
warranted
incapacitating
him.
they
weren't
merely
punishing
a
single
offense.
they
were
punishing
a
person,
or
they
were
incapacitating
a
person
that
they
found
to
be
an
incorrigible
offender.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
case
hasn't
been
seen
yet.
this
would
be
it.
this...
there
has
been...
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
there
has
been
no
case
since
harmelin
where
we
have
said
that
a
sentence
is
grossly
disproportionate,
and
no
lower
federal
court
has
struck
down
a
sentence
since
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
a
recidivist
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
there
been
a
recidivist
case
since
that
trilogy
that
you
recited?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
were
the
words
that
it
used?
i
don't
think
it
was
that
strong.
i
thought
it
questioned
whether
those...
that
was
still
good
law.
