mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit's
grant
of
habeas
relief
in
this
case
should
be
reversed
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
court
erred
in
setting
aside
the
state
court
judgment
because
it
did
not
properly
apply
the
principles
of
habeas
corpus
review
to
cases
that
are
considered
under
the
aedpa.
as
confirmed
in
two
concurring
opinions
issued
by
this
court
yesterday,
early
v.
hill
and
woodford
v.
visciotti,
this
case
is
resolvable
on
aedpa
grounds
and
therefore
the
court
need
not
address
the
constitutional
issues
in
this
case.
in
any
event,
independent
of
the
habeas
corpus
aspects
of
this
case,
the
sentence
in
this
case
is
not
grossly
disproportionate
and
therefore
does
not
violate
this...
the
eighth
amendment.
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
2254(d),
a
federal
court
may
not
grant
habeas
relief
unless
the
state
court
determination
on
the
merits
was
either
contrary
to,
or
involved
an
unreasonable
application
of
this
court's
clear
controlling
precedent.
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
state
court
determination
involved
an
unreasonable
application.
despite
the
ninth--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
despite
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
in
this
case,
a
careful
analysis
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
here
reveals
that
although
they
reversed,
or
granted
habeas
relief,
reversing
the
district
court
on
unreasonable
application
grounds,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
this,
all
of
the
reasoning
lends
itself
to
a
contrary-to
analysis
rather
than
an
unreasonable
application,
and
opposing,
or
the
respondent
has,
in
fact
briefed
the
contrary-to
prong
of
the
2254
as
well
as
the
unreasonable
application
prong.
for
example,
the...
and
for
the
most
part
the
circuit
court
held
that
holding
was
based
on
the
conclusion
that
the
state
court
merits
determination
erred
because
it
did
not
consider
the
three-case
triumvirate
of
rummel,
solem,
and
harmelin,
and
faulted
the
state
court
for
failing
to
apply,
or
essentially
disregarding
solem,
but
as
early
v.
packer
made
clear
yesterday,
on...
when
we
are
talking
about
a
contrary-to
application,
it's
not
necessary
for
the
state
court
to
have
cited
this
court's
controlling
authority,
and
it's
not
even
necessary
for
the
court
to
be
aware
of
it,
and
in
fact
the
state
court
in
this
case
cited,
or
provided
what
we
call
a
lynch
analysis
under
california
law,
which
incorporated
virtually
every
aspect
of
the
solem
analysis
that
the
state
court
said...
pardon
me,
that
the
ninth
circuit
said
the
state
court
disregarded.
so
on
that
basis
alone,
and
i
think
early
makes...
the
per
curiam
opinion
in
early
makes
clear
that
that's
okay
if
you
have
an
application
of
state
law,
or
you
rely
on
state
law
that
provides
even
greater
depth
of
analysis
than
the
federal
rule
would
require,
and
that's
what
happened
here.
the
lynch
analysis
requires
what
would
be
comparable
to
the
second
and
third
prongs
under
the
solem
analysis,
which,
following
harmelin,
are
deemed
no
longer
required
unless...
and
serve
only
to
validate
an
initial
inference
on
the
first
prong,
so
this
was
clearly
not
a
contrary-to
case.
the
court...
the
state
court--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--yes,
justice
stevens,
i
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
there
is
no
inference--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
i
do
agree
with
that,
and
on
the
eighth
amendment,
the
pure
eighth
amendment
question,
that
there
was
no
inference
of
gross
disproportionality
here,
and
therefore
the
second
and
third
prongs
were
not
required,
but
the
state
court
did,
in
fact,
apply
a
second
and
third
prong
analysis,
and
that
leads
into
the
only
portion
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
that
really
addresses
the
reasonableness
of
the
state
court's
decision.
the
ninth
circuit
disposed
of
the
unreasonable
application
analysis
in
a
footnote,
and
it
basically
said
that
the
state
court's
reliance
on
state
law
is
irrelevant
because
it
didn't
cite
federal
law,
and
i
think
that
the
decision
yesterday
in
early
v.
hill
kind
of
renders
that
particular
portion
of
the
analysis--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--the
record
does
not
indicate
whether
there
were
or
not,
your
honor.
the
priors
that
were
the
predicate
for
the
three
strikes
sentence
were
both
residential
burglaries,
and
there...
we
have
no
facts
concerning
them
in
the
record,
but
the
gravamen,
as
we
all
know,
of
a
residential
burglary
is
the
potential
for
danger
and
violence
that
comes
from
invading
someone's
home,
and
also
subsequent
to
this
case
being
decided
quite
recently,
the
california
legislature
amended
its
statute
and
now
includes
a
residential
burglary
where
the
house
is
occupied
in
its
articulation
of
violent
felonies.
it's
no
longer
just
confined
to
the
serious
felony--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
not
to
be
overly
inconsistent
between
our
mutual
arguments,
but
i
think
this
court
has
held
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
violence
does
not
necessarily
dictate
the
proportionality
analysis.
there
may
be
circumstances
where
a
crime
is
of
sufficient
gravity
that
doesn't
involve
violence,
such
that
extremely
long
sentences
are
appropriate.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
it's
going
to
change
dramatically
is
determinative
or
dispositive,
but
i
do
think,
justice
breyer,
that
there
are
a
couple
of
responses
to
that
question.
first
of
all,
turning
back
to
one
of
the
questions
justice
souter
asked
in
the
prior
argument,
i
believe
that
when
the
state
is
going
to
define
certain
felonies
as
being
sufficiently
serious
to
trigger
the
imposition
of
the
three
strikes,
or
three
strikes
approach
or
harsher
sentencing,
i
think
a
rational
basis...
the
courts
may
be
required
to
engage
in
a
heightened
scrutiny
analysis
to
determine
whether
there's
a
rational
basis
for
that
in
the
first
place.
but
i
think
that's
distinct
from
any
proportionality
analysis,
and
the
problem
with
the
hypothetical
that
you
pose
is
that,
while
you
are
correct
that
there
is
a
subjective
prong
to
this,
the
question
is,
where
does
that
subjectivity
belong?
is
it
within
the
particular
personal
subjective
views
of
the
reviewing
court,
or
is
it
within
the
confines
of
the
subjective
views
as
reflect...
that
the
legislature
represents
of
the
subjective
views
of
the
citizenry?
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--i--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--i
understand
your
question,
justice
breyer,
to
basically
go
to
what
is
grossly
disproportionate.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
and
the
court,
this
court
has
not
defined
that
term,
or
given
us
any
clear
guidelines,
but
we
do
know
that
by
the
very
nature,
grossly
disproportionate
implies
an
extreme
situation,
and--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--not
really,
because
i
suppose...
i
mean,
in
an
extreme
example,
justice
kennedy,
we
could
lock
up
everybody
for
extremely
long
periods
of
time,
and
it
could
still
go
past
that
point
of
proportion,
of
gross
disproportionality.
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
more
clear
definition
than
simply
the
impact
of
the
sentencing
statute,
and--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--the
limiting--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--the
limiting
principle
we
offer
is,
or
we
urge
upon
the
court
is
the
one
that's
been
mentioned
in
a...
or
has
been
used
as
related
to
an
example
mentioned
in
a
couple
of
the
court's
opinions,
when
they
refer
to
lifetime
for
parking,
and
the
reasonable
mean...
understanding
of
that
example
is
often
cited
as
a
life
sentence
for
a
first-time
parking--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--the
limiting
principle
would
be
that
those
are,
that
sentences
are
grossly
disproportionate
when
they
are
not
reasonably
susceptible
to
debate
amongst
reasonable
minds.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
no,
your
honor,
i...
justice
stevens,
i
disagree
with
that.
it
is
not
a
50-year
sentence
for
stealing
tapes,
it
is
two
25-years-to-life
sentences.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
they
are
consecutive.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
because
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
two
things
in
reaching
that
conclusion.
first
of
all,
they
represent
independent
episodes
of
criminal
behavior.
they
are
not
connected.
they
may
have
the
impact
of
resulting
in
a
50-year
sentence,
but
it...
but
they
do
reflect
the
fact
that
the...
mr.
andrade
in
this
case
demonstrated
beyond
any
question
that
he
is
a
habitual
offender.
he
was
arrested
and
either
cited
and
released,
or
booked
and
released
and
2
weeks
later
he
went
right
back
out
and
did
the
same
thing.
not
only
that,
he
told
the
probation
officer
that
he
stole
the
tapes
in
order
to
sell
them
to
buy
heroin,
not
as
gifts
for
his
children,
but
to
buy
heroin
with.
he
also
indicated
he
was
a
hopeless
heroin
addict,
and
that
he
always
does
something
stupid
when
released
from
prison,
and
i
think
the
reasonable
inference
of
what
he
meant
was,
he
always
goes
out
and
recommits
crimes,
so
i
think
that's
part
of
why
it's
not
a
50-year--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--he's
being
punished
because
of
his,
of
a
combination
of
his
record
of
recidivism
and
his...
or
his
habitual
criminal
behavior.
the
other
reason
i
think
it's
important
to
make
the
distinction
between
the
two
25-to-life
sentences
versus
characterizing
it
as
50
to
life
for
receiving,
or
for
stealing
some
tapes
is
because
of
the
ameliorative
effects
of
the
california
sentencing
structure.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
and
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
if
i
misstated
that,
i
did
not
mean
to.
i
think
that
the--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--absolutely,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
no,
i
did
not
mean--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
it
doesn't
bear
on
proportionality,
i
certainly
believe
that
it
does.
i
simply
said
that
standing
alone,
without
any
further
consideration,
that
would
also
justify
an
extreme
example,
but
yes,
i
do
believe
that
it
does
bear
on
proportionality
in
light
of
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
statute,
but
in
measuring
that
legislative
purpose,
i
do
believe
that
what's
reasonable...
sentences,
evaluating
sentences
on
whether
they
are
reasonably
susceptible
to
debate
also
provides
a
framework
or
a
lens
with
which
to
look,
to
apply
that
analysis.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
not
exactly,
justice
ginsburg.
we
are
saying
that
the
case
is
disposable
on
aedpa
grounds,
but
if
the
court
found
that
the
state
court
merits
determination
was
unreasonable,
it
necessarily
would
have
to
turn
to
the
eighth
amendment
issue.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
the
latter,
justice
ginsburg.
the
methodology
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
developed
as
articulated
in
van
tran
is
inconsistent
with
the
very
spirit
of
the
aedpa.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
i
would
like
to
clarify
that,
justice
stevens.
i
didn't
say
that
the
proper
analysis
in
this
case
was
contrary
to.
i
said
that
the
ninth
circuit
purported
to
reach
an
unreasonable
application
prong,
but
when
you
look
at
their
reasoning,
it
actually
is
a
contrary-to
argument
that
they
made,
and
i
meant
to
say
that
when...
if...
to
the
extent
that
it
is
a
contrary-to
decision
that
they
made,
no
matter
the
fact
that
they
ultimately
labeled
it
unreasonable
application,
this
court's
per
curiam
decision
yesterday
in
early
v.
packer
has
essentially
resolved
that
question,
because
of
what
they
base
their
decision
on.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
the
federal
rule
i
think
is
articulated
in
harmelin,
and
that
is
that
grossly
disproportionate
sentences
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
yes.
you're...
i
would.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
i
don't
think
that
we
have
to...
that
it's
necessary
to
resolve
the
eighth
amendment
question,
but
it
may
be
necessary
to
know
what
the
rule
is
before
we
know
whether
the
state
court
selected
the
right
rule
or
not--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--correct.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
in
many
circumstances
it
may
be.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
correct.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
yes.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
the...
i
think
you
can't...
that
begs
the
question.
it
cannot
disassociate
the
wobbler
offense
that's
at
issue
in
this
particular
case
from
the
recidivism.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
but
it's
a
certain
class
of
recidivists.
it's
not
just
recidivists
in
general.
it
is
that
class--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--that's
already
demonstrated
that
they
are
willing
to
commit
the
most
serious
and
violent--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--potentially
violent
types
of
crimes,
and
has
now
indicated
that
they
are
also
unwilling
to
remain
law-abiding,
and
there
comes
a
point
at
which
the
state
has
a
right
to
say,
enough
is
enough.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
well,
i
think
that
would
probably
return
to
the
rational
basis,
the...
analysis.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
wobblers
and
the
jay-walking.
there's
the
obvious
distinction
that
there's
a
longstanding
historical
tradition
between
felonies
and
misdemeanors
and
infractions.
the
infractions,
the
jay-walking
doesn't
even
present,
for
the
most
part,
a
property
or
personal
safety
issue.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
there
is,
i
believe,
a
code
on
the
books
that
makes
it
an
offense,
or
an
infraction.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
the...
if
the
california
legislature
chose--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--that
is
not
a
wobbler
offense.
it's
a
parole
revocation
issue.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
it
is
in
the
sense
that
the
court
has
held
that
when
doing
a
proportionality
analysis,
his
entire
criminal
picture
can
be
taken
into
consideration.
we're
not...
the
court
is
not
required
to
confine
the
analysis
only
to
the
predicate
and
triggering
offenses,
so
in
that
sense
it
does...
it
is
an
indication
of
continued
habitual
criminality
and
an
unwillingness
to
remain
law-abiding.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
yes,
but
it
requires
an
explanation,
your
honor.
he...
mr.
andrade
did,
in
fact,
ask
the
court
for
misdemeanor
treatment
under
california
penal
code
section
17(b).
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor,
but
there
is
an
odd
chronological
history
here
that's
just...
that
distinguishes
this
case.
the
california
court
of
appeal,
or...
pardon
me.
the
judgment
came
down
in
this
case
a
few
weeks
before
the
california
supreme
court
issued
its
decision
in
romero
granting
trial
courts
the
discretion
to
dismiss
priors,
so
in
the
california
court
of
appeals
decision,
they
noted
that
that
romero
decision
had
said
that
if
you
got
a
record
that
you
can't
determine
whether
the
sentencing
judge
knew
whether
he
had
or
not...
he
or
she
had
discretion
to
dismiss
the
strikes,
then
the
proper
basis
for
addressing
that
is
through
state
habeas.
mr.
andrade
then
filed
a
petition
for
review
to
the
california
supreme
court
which
was
denied,
and
without
prejudice
to
file
a
state
habeas
corpus
petition
based
on
romero,
which
he
did.
he
went
back
to
state
court,
filed
a
habeas
corpus
petition...
pardon
me.
he
did
not
file
a
state
habeas
corpus
petition...
pardon
me.
he
did
file
a
state
habeas
corpus
petition
which
was
entertained
by
the
same
sentencing
court
that
had
sentenced
him,
and
that
court
said
that
it
did
not
find
that
he
was
appropriate
candidate
for
dismissing
the
strikes.
curiously,
though,
that
court
also
noted
that
if
it
felt
that
it
read
the
law
as
having
discretion
to
impose
concurrent
rather
than
consecutive
sentences,
it
might
consider
it.
that
wasn't
an
issue
at
the
time.
it
was
just
kind
of
dicta
within
the
court's,
the
sentencing
court's
decision.
ultimately,
though,
about
a
year
later,
the
california
supreme
court
issued
another
case
called
people
v.
garcia
in
which
the
supreme
court
said
that
sentencing
courts
have
a
right
to
dismiss
strikes
on
a
count-by-count
basis,
and
mr.
andrade
has
never
asked
by
any
vehicle
for
a
reconsideration
of
that
issue,
so
in
theory
he
could
go
back
at
this
point
and
file
another
state
habeas
corpus
petition
and
ask
for
what
we
would
call
garcia
consideration,
and...
which,
based
on
what
the
court,
the
sentencing
court
had
previously
indicated,
the
court
might
be
inclined
to
grant
him,
which
would
reduce
this
sentence
if,
assuming
it
was
applied
to
one
of
the
counts,
to
a
25-year-to-life
sentence.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
we
would
not
concede
the
issue,
but...
and
i'm
not
saying
that
we
would
necessarily
oppose
it,
but
it
is
available
to
him.
we'd
have
to
consider
our
position
on
that
if
and
when
it
was...
he
made
that
application.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
thank
you.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
thank
you.
given
the
limited
time,
there
are
just
a
couple
of
brief
points
i
would
like
to
make
about
respondent's
argument.
i
think
it's
clear
that
when
he's
arguing
that
the
proportionality
analysis
has
to
be
confined
to
the
predicate
offenses
and
the
triggering
offense,
without
regard
to
the
entire
record,
what
he
is
essentially
doing
is
raising
a
facial
challenge
to
the
statute
despite
the
fact
that
the
ninth
circuit
claimed
that
they
were
not
invalidating
the
statute,
and
to
that
extent
that
any
facial
challenge
can
be
made,
the
ameliorating
provisions
of
the
california
scheme
would
result
in
a
finding
that
the
statute
is
not...
in...
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
secondly,
just
as
a
points,
a
couple
of
points
of
correction...
the
court
has
already
touched
upon
it...
the
court
of
appeal
did
not
question
whether
the
proportionality
analysis
was
correct.
it
questioned
whether
solem's
version
of
the
proportionality
analysis
was
still
correct.
that's
what
the
state
court
did,
and
it
still
went
ahead
and
applied
a
proportionality
analysis
via
a
state
court
decision
of
lynch.
and
in
terms
of
whether
gross
disproportionality
was
addressed
or
not,
the
state
used,
or
the
state
court
used
a
standard
articulated
from
lynch,
which
is
shocks
the
conscience,
and
it
is
much
stronger
language
and
is
at
least
reasonably
a
euphemism
for
grossly
disproportionate.
also,
i
will
find
the
page
in
just
a
moment,
but
i
believe
at
the
sentencing
hearing
the
judge
did
indicate
that
he
had
considered
the
probation
report.
it's
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
i
will
find
the
cite
in
a
moment.
ultimately,
if
there's
any
doubt
about
whether
there's
clear
precedent
or
not,
the...
i
think
that
the
state
court
determination
should
be
given
deference
in
this
case,
and
almost
finally,
not...
andrade
did
not
receive
life
for
three
burglaries
and
two
petties,
he
received
that
because
the
ameliorating
provisions
go
into
the
analysis,
and
as
he
was
not
granted
the
benefit
of
any
of
them,
and
in
fact
hasn't
even
asserted
one
of
them,
he
did
not
receive
that
sentence
for
that,
for
strictly
life
for
three
burglaries
and
two
petties.
he's
received
it
based
on
his
overall
record.
in
terms
of
whether
there
are...
anyone
else
in
california
has
suffered
a
similar
sentence,
while
we...
i
have
no
reference
to
any
50-year-to-life
sentences
based
on
two
convictions,
there
are
300
and...
approximately
344
defendants
in
california
serving
25-year-to-life
sentences
for
petty
offense,
offense
with
a
prior
which
constitutes
the
one
25-to-life
sentence.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
correct,
your
honor.
finally--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--no.
it
was
simply
a
response
to
respondent's
assertion
that
we
could
not
point
to
anyone
else
serving
a
similarly
severe
sentence
for
a
similar
crime--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
well,
i
don't
think...
i
would
not
characterize
it
as
trivial,
but
i
understand--
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
--i
think
that
under
the
california
scheme
it's
clear
presumptively
that
theft
is
a
felony
offense,
and
we
simply
grant...
and
california
simply
grants
the
first-time
offender
an
opportunity
to
reform.
i
don't
consider
it
trivial
or
minor.
ultimately,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
disapprove
van
tran.
it's
presenting
significant
problems.
it's
inconsistent
with
this
court's
pronouncements
in
williams
v.
taylor
and
in
bell
v.
cone
and
penry
v.
johnson.
it
establishes
a
methodology
that
is
simply
incorrect,
and
finally,
in
1996,
congress
limited
the
scope
of
federal
habeas
corpus
review.
here,
the
ninth
circuit
failed
to
properly
apply
those,
the
principles
guiding
that
analysis.
mr.
douglas
p.
danzig
thank
you,
your
honor.
