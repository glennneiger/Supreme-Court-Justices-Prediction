justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
on
the
merits
that
we
can't
convert
this
court
into
a
sentencing
commission,
but
it's
also
true,
i
guess,
that
there
must
be
some
way
of
deciding
when
a
state
has
gone
too
far,
and
i
don't
know
any
way
that's
other
than
highly
subjective,
except
to
look
at
data
that
would
show
what
happened
in
the
past,
but
if
you
take
that,
how
do
you
give
the
state
the
right
to
become
harsher
in
the
future?
now,
you're
going
to
say,
well,
it
has
that
right,
and
of
course
it
does
to
a
degree,
but
is
there
a
way
to
say
that
it
has
to
meet
some
burden,
or
that
it
has
to
show
something
if
it's
going
to
change
dramatically
what
was
the
consensus
in
the
past--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
a
harsh
direction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
to
be
the
latter,
but
still
there
has
to
be
a
way
of
deciding
when
they
go
too
far.
in
other
words--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
what
i'm
looking
for,
and
i
look
to...
you
know,
what
i've
said
before
as
a
way
of
isolating
the
problem,
and
then...
and
i
think
here
you
might
say
that
on
the
merits
of
your
case,
it'll...
you'd
be
hard-pressed
to
find
many
examples
outside
of
the
three
strikes
laws
where
there
were
such
sentences
given
for
such
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
so.
i
mean,
there
are
a
handful
in
the
sg's
brief,
that's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
go
back
for
a
second
to
the
merits
of
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
i...
we
all
have...
my
problem
that
i'm
struggling
with
is,
is
there
an
objective
standard.
you're
absolutely
right
about
what
the
problem
is
i'm
having,
and
i
tend
to...
do
look
to
this
empirical
stuff
as
a
way
of
finding
an
objective
standard,
and
if
here
the
empirical
part
suggests
this
is
way
out
of
line,
i'm
now
faced
with
the
question,
well,
can't
the
state
make
a
harsher
system
if
it
has
a
reason
for
doing
it,
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
must
be
yes.
but
then...
then
i'd
ask,
very
well,
doesn't
the
state
have
to
come
up
with
some
reason
that's
persuasive
in
this
case
that
it
makes
a
difference
to
extend
the
three-strike
thing
with
this
kind
of
thing
in
mind,
this
kind
of
case
in
mind,
to
the
wobblers?
i
mean,
is
there
some
punitive
purpose
in
terms
of
incapacitation
that's
gained,
of
a
significant
kind,
by
increasing
the
wobbler
sentences
by
factors
of,
you
know,
multiples
of
four
or
five
or
10
or
something,
over
what
they
would
have
been
before
when
committed
by
serious
criminals,
and
i
guess
the
answer
to
that
is,
there's
no
indication,
or
is
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
only
considering
the
class
of
recidivists,
and
i'm
saying...
let's
call
them
recidivist
plus
wobbler,
all
right.
that
group
of
people,
recidivist
plus
wobbler,
is
getting
an
enormous
increase
in
sentence
over
what
was
or
is
any
other
place,
on
average,
and
therefore
i
think,
gee,
maybe
this
is
really
grossly
disproportionate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
jay-walking?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
if
jay-walking's
not
there,
and
this
is,
the
wobblers,
why
can
the
wobblers
be
there,
but
not
the
jay-walkers?
that's
what
i'm...
that's
what
i'm
thinking
about
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
saying,
i
take
it,
on
this
point
that
let's
think
of
the
class
of
serious
criminals,
and
we've
decided
in
california
to
tell
all
people
in
that
class
one
more
crime,
you've
had
it.
now,
they
have
to
define
one
more
crime,
and
so
where
they
choose
to
draw
the
line
is
the
line
not
before
you
get
to
wobblers,
but
the
line
after
you
get
to
wobblers,
and
they
say
that
takes
jay-walking
and
parking
offenses
and
everything
and
says,
we're
not
talking
about
those,
we're
talking
about
these,
and
what
the
other
side
is
arguing
is,
that's
within
the
legislative
discretion
that
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
must
give.
all
right.
why
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
no,
they're
saying
on
that
particular
point,
and
i'm
trying
to
get
your
response--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
say,
there
are
felonies
which
are
not
wobblers,
and
they're
quite
serious.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
wobblers
which
are
medium-serious,
and
there
are
those
things
that
can't
even
wobble.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are
trivial,
and
where
we
choose
to
draw
the
line
is
between
the
last...
you
know,
between...
below
the
wobblers
and
not
above.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
it
could.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
could,
and
they'll
say
yes,
that
is
true
in
certain
circumstances,
and
then
they
will
repeat
the
argument
i
just
made.
i'm
not
holding
him
to
my
argument.
i'm
trying
to
push
you
a
little
bit,
and
to
say,
if
people
are
told,
one
more
gum
ball
and
you've
had
it,
that's
a
legitimate
purpose
of
sentencing.
now,
how
do
i
come
back
in
some
other
than
purely
subjective
way
and
say,
well,
you
know,
you've
gone
too
far?
is
there
anything
one
is
to
appeal
to
other
than
a
judge's
subjective
reaction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we
have
the
sg's
footnote,
which
does
have
a
few.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
not
this
serious.
i
mean,
not
this
trivial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
this...
i'm
looking
for
the
right
word.
not
this
minor?
