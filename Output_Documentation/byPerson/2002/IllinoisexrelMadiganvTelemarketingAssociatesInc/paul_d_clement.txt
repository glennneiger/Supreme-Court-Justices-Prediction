mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
repeatedly
reaffirmed
the
government's
authority
to
protect
the
public
from
fraud,
even
though
virtually
every
representation
involves
speech.
indeed,
while
striking
down
broad
prophylactic
laws,
every
time
this
court
has
addressed
the
issue
of
charitable
solicitation,
it
has
reaffirmed
the
constitutional
viability
of
individual
fraud
actions.
now,
part
of
the
reason
that
this
court
has
distinguished
between
individual
fraud
actions
and
broad
prophylactic
rules
is
that
an
individual
fraud
action
can
bring
into
bear
the
entire
context
of
a
misrepresentation.
the
difficulty
with
a
statute
like
that
before
the
court
in
riley
was
that
it
necessarily
focused
on
a
single
factor,
fundraising
costs,
and
didn't
take
into
account
what
was
told
to
individual
donors
or
anything
else,
and
then
categorically--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that
the
fundraising
costs
are
part
of
the
analysis
of
the
fraud
action,
but
i
wouldn't
have
read
riley
as
making
that
factor
wholly
immaterial,
and
i
think
the
important
thing
is
that
in
the
calls
in
this
case,
they
weren't
just
saying,
we're
here
to
raise
money
for
vietnam
vets.
the
record
suggests
that
there
was
an
emphasis
on
particular
charitable
services.
we're
raising
money
for
food
baskets.
we're
raising
money
to
help
veterans
here
in
dupage
county.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
two
responses,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
since
there
are
these
specific
misrepresentations
in
this
case,
that
alone
is
a
reason
to
reverse
the
decision,
because
the
illinois
supreme
court
seemed
to
be
laboring
under
the
misimpression
that
those
cases
were
wholly
off-limits
because
the
fundraising
percentage--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
so
let
me
bring
you
to
the
second
part
of
the
question,
which
is,
i
think
there
are
problems
when
you
have
a
situation
where
the
only
thing
that
is
said
is,
we're
here
to
raise
money
for
charity,
but
i
think
in
reality,
you
have
to
give...
you
have
to
trust
juries
in
common
law
fraud
actions
a
little
bit
to
take
into
account
the
broad
nature
of
the
representations
that
are
made.
the...
the
virtue
of
a
fraud
action
as
opposed
to
a
broad
prophylactic
rule
is
that
a
fraud
action
can
take
into
account
the
entire
mosaic
of
the
representations
that
are
made,
and
there's
no
need
to
focus
on
one
particular
tile
and
see
whether
it's
literally
true
or
literally
false.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i...
i
think
so.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
if
every--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--because
there
are
other
elements
of
a
common
law
fraud
action.
you
also
have
to
show
materiality,
and
reasonable
reliance.
if
every
single
person
raised--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--because
if
every
single
person
raising
money
has
had
these
astronomical
fundraising
costs,
which
of
course
is
not
true,
but
if
that
were
true,
then
a...
an
individual
donor
who
recognized
that
might
well
not
have
any
reasonable
reliance
on
the
representations
that
money
is
going
to
charity,
because
no...
no
charity,
apparently,
can
get
any
money
to
the
actual
services
that
money
is
being
raised,
but
that's
not
true.
a
very
important
element
of
common
law
fraud
that
i
think
can
provide
sufficient
protection
to
legitimate
charities
is
the
intent
to
deceive,
and
the
intent
to
deceive
i
think
is
going
to
make
a
big
difference,
because
if
you
have
a
legitimate
charity
that's
asked
by
a
donor
what
percentage
of
the
money
goes
to
the
specific
service
that
you're
raising
money
for,
let's
say,
food
baskets,
and
that
charity
responds
and
provides
forthcoming
information,
then
i
don't
see
how
the
prosecution
or
plaintiff
can
ever
show
an
intent
to
deceive.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i...
i
think
that's
right,
but
i...
i
would
say--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
part
of
the
evidence
i'd
like
to
put
before
the
jury
on
intent
to
deceive--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--is
when
a
donor
asks
that
question--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'm
reliably
informed
that
this
particular
proceeding
would
go
as
a
bench
trial,
which
i
think
would
provide
even
further
protection
for
free
speech.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that...
my
answer
is
in
terms
of
the
jury
because
i
do
think
that
the...
the
decision
that
this
court
announces
is
going
to
affect
jury
trials
as
well,
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
i'd
like
to
get
before
the
jury
the
fact
that
when
these
particular
fundraisers
were
asked
the
question,
well,
where
does
the
money
go,
at
least
the
record
suggests
that
they
flatly
misrepresented
where
the
money--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
would
say
first
that
we
wouldn't
have
any
objection
if
you
wanted
to
retreat
from
what
you
said
in
riley.
[laughter]
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but...
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
that
is
not
what
you
have
to
do,
and
i
think
the
important
thing
is
the
type
of
hypo
of
just
all
they
do
is
call
up
and
say,
i'm
here
to
raise
money
for
charity,
what
that
hypothetical
tends
to
do
is
force
the
analysis
into
the
single
variable
analysis
that's
reflected
in
broad
prophylactic
rules,
and
the
answer
in
these
cases,
and
i
think
what
the
opinion
should
suggest,
is
that
the
context
does
matter
terribly,
so
to
take
some
of
the
questions--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
concern
justice
breyer,
if
i
could,
when
he's
worried
about
the
start-up
charity,
well,
if
a
start-up
charity
says,
hi,
we're
a
start-up
charity,
we
are
trying
to
raise
money
for
a
new
cause,
and
here's
what
we
hope
to
do
with
the
money,
that's
very
different
than
if
a
start-up
charity
picks
up
the
phone
and
says,
we're
a
start-up
charity,
and
we're
going...
if
you
give
us
money,
we're
going
to
help
this
particular
child
in
this
foreign
country.
i
mean,
if
a
start-up
charity
avoids
fraudulent
statements,
then
that's
going
to
have
a
reasonable
effect
on
the
mind
of
the
donor,
and
the
donor's
going
to
recognize
that,
okay,
a)
start-up
charities
may
have
higher
cost,
but
more
importantly,
the
representation
that
i
received
was
not
that
you
were
going
to
provide
food
baskets
in
dupage
county,
but
that
you
hoped
to
provide
special
services
that
weren't
being
provided
currently
by
any
extant
charity,
and
i
think
that
context
can
make
all
the
difference.
and
there
are
many
elements
of
common
law
fraud
actions.
you
have
to
show
knowledge
of
falsity,
intent
to
deceive,
materiality,
and
reasonable
reliance.
in
illinois,
as
is
typical,
you
have
to
show
those
factors
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
all
of
that
is
going
to
provide
substantial
breathing
room
for
first
amendment
values.
indeed,
much
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
the
libel
and
deformation
area
has
been
a
process
of
taking
the
requirements
of
the
common
law
for
fraud,
which
were
much
more
onerous,
and
superimposing
them
on
the
law
of
libel
and
defamation,
where
things
like
falsity
was
presumed,
and
damages
could
be
presumed,
upon
a
showing
of
defamation,
and
i
think
if
you
put
it
in
that
context,
that
all
of
the
safeguards
that
this
court
has
carefully
constructed
over
the
years
in
the
libel
and
defamation
context
are
in
place
to
protect
the...
the
first
amendment
rights
and
provide
breathing
room,
then
i
think
that
the
idea
that
the
sky
is
falling
is
really
mistaken
in
these
cases.
and
i
think
to
the
contrary,
if
this
court
were
to
suggest
in
a
case
where
the
reality
is
that
not
just
85
percent
is
going
to
the
professional
fundraiser,
but
fully
97
percent
is
going
to
something
other
than
program
services,
because
vietnow
only
spends
20
percent
of
the
money
they
receive
on
program
services,
if
this
were...
court
were
to
suggest
in
this
case
that
there's
not
a
fraud
action,
then
it
really
will
be
open
season
for
charitable
solicitation
fraud.
and
i
think
this
court
has
been
particularly
concerned
about
broad
prophylactic
rules
in
the
first
amendment
area.
this
is
reflected
in...
in,
most
critically
in
its
prior
restraint
doctrine,
and
that...
that
instinct
is
reflected
in
schaumburg,
munson,
and
riley,
but
at
the
same
time,
there's
a
corollary
principle,
which
specific
instances
of
fraud
can
be
prosecuted
by
the
government,
and
that
instinct
is
also
reflected
in
munson,
schaumburg,
and
riley,
and
there's
simply
nothing
in
the
first
amendment
that
suggests
that
charitable
solicitation
fraud
need
go
unpunished,
and
with
respect,
i
think
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
here
in
creating
a
broad
prophylactic
immunity
for
charitable
solicitation
from
the
law
of
fraud
is
just
as
unjustified
as
the
broad
prophylactic
rules
limiting
charitable
solicitation
that
this
court
struck
down
in
schaumburg,
munson,
and
riley.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
