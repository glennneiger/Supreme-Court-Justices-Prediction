justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look
at
all...
think
of
all
of
the...
of
the
green,
dark
green
briefs.
those
briefs
are
filled
with
examples
of
instances
where
the
telemarketer
kept
a
large,
maybe
90,
maybe
100
percent,
which
seem
perfectly
legitimate.
for
example,
it's
a
start-up
campaign,
and
at
the
beginning
they
have
to
keep
up
more,
keep
more.
for
example,
it's
an
educational
campaign,
and
what
the
charity
thinks
is,
we
want
to
spend
this
money
so
people
will
have
heard
our
name,
or
will
examine
themselves
for
possible
breast
cancer,
or
whatever.
or,
it
could
even
be
the
nature
conservancy,
where
for
accounting
reasons
the
money
that's
going
to
purchase
land
is
not
treated
as
if
it
were
an
expense
on
behalf
of
the
charity,
so
they're
filled
with
examples.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
suppose
in
your
case
the
defendant
proved
that
he
was
within
one
of
those
examples.
would
you
then
say,
if
the
jury
believes
that,
that
you
should
win,
or
the
defendant,
and
the
reason
i
ask
is
that
i
think
most
people
feel,
and
the
relevance
of
your
case
is
that
the
money
is
going
to
help
the
charity,
indeed,
most
of
it,
and
what
they
will
have
shown
is
that
the
money
did
go
to
help
the
charity,
but
in
this
instance,
helping
the
charity
was
consistent
with
the
telemarketer
keeping
a
very
large
percentage,
so
could
you
explain
how,
in
your
view,
the
law
works
with
all
those
examples
in
the
dark
green
briefs?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
well,
if
you're
saying
that
they
lose,
the
telemarketer,
even
if
all
the
money
is
being
used
to
help
the
charity,
then
i
agree
with
the
thrust
of
the
questions
that
have
gone
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
how
you
can
possibly
prosecute
people
for
fraud
where
there
is
no
fraud--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and...
and
that
would
seem
to
me
a
case
where
there
is
no
fraud.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
a
charity,
too,
so
there's
a
first
amendment
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
in
other
words,
you
intend
to
convict
people...
you
intend
to
convict
them,
and
this
may
be
one
of
them.
you
intend
to
convict
the
nature
conservancy
because
98
percent
of
its
revenue
is...
is
accounted
for
as...
as
telemarketing
expense,
where
in
reality,
they're
buying
land
with
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
you
intend
to
convict
the...
the
organization
that
is
simply
trying
to
inform
women
about
the
importance
of
self-examination
for
cancer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
allegation
in
paragraph
63,
from
1987
through
the
present,
in
conducting
their
charitable
solicitations,
the
donors
made
representations
which
induced
the
donors
to
contribute
funds
for
charitable
purposes
by
representing
that
the
funds
they
contributed
would
go
to
charitable
purposes.
now,
that
doesn't
say
what
the
particular
representations
were,
but
they
had
a
lot
of
affidavits
attached
which
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i'm
saying,
in
terms
of
whether
there
is
an
allegation
in
the
complaint.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
understanding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
the
question
is
simply
whether
they've
alleged
that
there
were
specific
affirmative
representations,
and
the
status,
i
gather
from
the
sg's
brief
and
what
i've
just
read,
is
that
they
allege
there
were
representations,
and
then
they
attached
affidavits
which
have
in
them,
and
there's
a
footnote
in
the
sg's
brief
that
list
the
affidavits,
statements
as
to
particular
affirmative
representations,
and...
and
therefore,
i
want
to
know
is
that,
if
that
issue
isn't
in
the
case,
fine,
but...
but
i'm
somewhat
puzzled
as
to
why
it
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
i
ask
you,
taking
it
just
as
you
want
to
present
it,
fine,
and
i
think...
i'm...
i'm
convinced
that
there
are
a
lot
of
instances
in
which
somebody
keeping
85
percent
of
the
money
would
be
perfectly
consistent
with
a
charitable
purpose,
but
there
may
also
be
quite
a
lot
of
instances
where
keeping
85
percent
of
the
money
serves
no
charitable
purpose,
and
really,
it
isn't
much
of
a
charity,
and
there
the
public
is
deceived.
now,
is
there
anything
wrong
with
prosecuting
that
kind
of
charity,
and
if
it
turns
out
to
be
the
first
instead
of
the
second,
you
could
raise
the
claim
later,
after
the
prosecution,
or
during
the
trial,
that
we
don't
know
what'll
happen
in
such
a
circumstance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that...
that's
correct.
that's
exactly
my
question.
i
understand
that
there
are
circumstances
where
that
fact,
that
virtually
all
the
money
goes
to
the
telemarketer
and
little
to
the
charity,
is
absolutely
justified
in
terms
of
charitable
purpose,
but
my
question,
which
i'm
repeating,
is,
there
may
be
many,
many,
many
instances
where
it
isn't,
and
so
what's
wrong
with
prosecuting
those
people
for
fraud?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
there's
a
perfectly
good
standard,
that
if
you're
going
to
keep
85
percent
of
the
money,
you
better
have
documents
showing
that
you're
doing
it
for
a
good,
charitable
reason,
that's
all,
and
the
people
who
will
be
prosecuted
are
the
people
that
can't
show
that.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now,
i'm
not
saying
that's
a
constitutional
standard.
i'm
not
saying
it's
a
state
law
standard.
i
don't
know
what
standard
it
would
be.
i
want
to
get
your
answer.
