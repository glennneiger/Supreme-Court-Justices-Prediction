i
suppose
the
breathing
room
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
false
statement,
a
misrepresentation,
let's
assume
with
knowledge
of
its
falsity,
which
is
relied
upon
by
the...
by
the
listener,
that
there's
some...
has
to
be
damage
and
so
forth.
is
that
what
you...
what
do
you
tell
the
jury,
what
a
reasonable
person
would
believe?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why...
why
is
it
that
if...
if
we
assume
that
the
donors
would
not
have
given
the
money
had
this
statement
been
made,
that
that
is
not
a
large
part
of
showing
a
misrepresentation,
i
mean,
i
assume
people
wouldn't
buy
automobiles
or
toasters
if
they
knew
that
the
manufacturer
was
getting
95
percent
of...
of
the
cost
and
there
was...
only
5
percent
went
into
raw
materials,
so
there's
always
some
problems
here,
but
let's
suppose
that
95
percent,
100
percent
of
the
donors
would
not
have
given
the
money
if
they
had
known
the
facts.
isn't
that
the
beginnings,
at
least,
of
a
misrepresentation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
isn't
it
material
if...
if
the
money
would
not
have
been
given
had
the...
had
the
fact
been
disclosed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
doesn't...
isn't
that
another
way
of
saying
the
person
is
acting
under
a
misimpression?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
make...
let's
make
an
assumption
that
95
percent
of
the
donors
in
the
case
of
your
client's
charity
would
not
have
given
the
money
had
they
known
of
the
amount
being
kept
by
the
telemarketers.
is
there
anything
the
state
can
do
to
protect
the
people
of...
of
the
state
from
having...
from
parting
with
their
money
under
those
circumstances?
