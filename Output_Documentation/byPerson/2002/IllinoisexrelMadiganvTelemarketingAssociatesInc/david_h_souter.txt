justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
concern
that
we
have
is
that
there's
no...
there
is
no
way
to
predict
in
advance
what
is
going
to
be
treated
or
what
is
going
to
be
found
as
the
half-truth.
let
me
put
the
question
to
you
this
way.
leave
to
the
side
the
moment
the
particular
cases
that
in...
that
you
include
among...
among
those
you
have
brought
in
which
at
least
the
allegation
is
that
a
very
specific
misrepresentation
was
made,
no
labor
cost,
90
percent
goes
to
the...
to
the...
the
objects
of
the
charity.
put
them
aside,
and
consider
only
the
cases
in
which
no
representation
is
made
beyond
the
fact
that
we
are
collecting
money
for
this
charity,
and
no
representation
is
made
about
the
amount
of
money
that's
going
to
go
for
overhead
and
the
amount
that's
actually
going
to
get
to
the
charitable
donees.
i
don't
see
where
any
charitable
fundraiser
could
in
advance
draw
a
line
and
say,
i
don't
have
to
disclose
anything
under
risk
of
being
prosecuted.
i
would
suppose
that
any
charitable
fundraiser,
if
you
win
this
case,
would
say,
there's
only
one
way
i
can
cover
myself,
and
that
is
to
disclose
the
percentages
when
i
make
the...
the
solicitation.
otherwise,
i'm
vulnerable
to
a
prosecution.
if
that
is
the
way
the
charitable
fundraisers
are
going
to
be
forced
to
operate,
then,
in
fact,
we
have
totally
undercut
the
precedent
that
says
you
can't
require
that
disclosure,
so
my
question
is,
how
can
we,
how
could
we
sanction
a
system
on
your
theory
that
would
be
fair,
without,
in
practical
terms,
whether
we
say
it
or
not,
requiring
the
very
disclosure
that
we
have
said
previously
need
not
be
required?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
maybe
we
should.
i'm
not
saying
one
way
or
the
other
there,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
let's
assume
that
it's
unrealistic
in
this
particular
case.
85/15,
okay,
let's
assume
you
win.
65/35,
60/40,
55-45...
it's
those
cases
that
we've
got
to
worry
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
let's
take...
let's
take
the
cases,
leaving
aside
the
specific
misrepresentations
here,
let's
take
the
case
that
we've
got.
15
percent
is
going.
i
take
it
you
believe
that
on
the
basis
of
that,
a...
a
jury
could
infer
that
there
was
an
intent
to
deceive,
from
the
silence?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
you
bet,
and
that's...
that's
what
you've
got
in
this
case,
but
as
justice
scalia
said,
we've
got
to
write
the
opinion,
and...
and
if
we
consider
the
case
in
which
there
were
not
these
quite
specific
misrepresentations,
all
you've
got
is
silence
about
the
percentage,
and
a
statement
that
the
object
of
the
charity
is
vietnamese
orphans
or
whatever
it
may
be,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
start
getting
below
the
85/25,
you
get
into
an
area
in
which
the...
the
result
is
a
dice
throw,
and
if
that
is
the
case,
the
only
way
the
charitable
fundraiser
can
protect
himself,
with
the
greatest
good
faith
in
the
world,
is
to
disclose
the
percentage,
and
if
that's
what
we
are
going
to
require
in
fact,
then
we
better
face
the
fact
that
we're
going
to
have
to
retreat
from...
from
what
we've
already
held.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
wouldn't
mind.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
what...
that's
what
we've
got
to
do,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
can't...
why...
why
isn't
it
appropriate
for
us
to
say
that
the
affidavits
can
function
for
first
amendment
purposes
like
a
bill
of
particulars,
and
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
ought
to
consider
that,
and
if,
under
illinois
practice,
they
could
function
as
a
bill
of
particulars,
then
there's
nothing
in
our
first
amendment
jurisprudence
that
prohibits
the
prosecution.
that
leaves
open
the
broader
question,
but
in
this
particular
case,
why
wouldn't
that
at
least
be
an
appropriate
response
for
this
court
to
make
with
respect
to
the
affidavits?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize
that
that's
not
the
way
it
was
originally
brought.
all
i'm
saying
is,
isn't
it
appropriate
for
us
to
say,
if...
if
we
otherwise
believe
it,
that
the
affidavits
can
function
consistently
with
the
first
amendment,
consistently
with
our
first
amendment
cases
as
a
bill
of
particulars--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and...
and
when
you
get
to
that
particular
level,
it's
okay
to
prosecute?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
just
as
a
matter
of
state
procedure
you
can't
do
that,
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
see.
