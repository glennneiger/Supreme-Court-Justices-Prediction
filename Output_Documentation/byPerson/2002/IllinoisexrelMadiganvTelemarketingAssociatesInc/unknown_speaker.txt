unknown
speaker
what
about--
unknown
speaker
--what
about
25
percent
going
to
the
charitable
purpose?
unknown
speaker
the
public's
told,
you
know,
i'm...
i'm
soliciting
for
x
charity,
would
you...
would
you
give
money,
please,
for
x
charity--
unknown
speaker
--to
help
children
in
cambodia.
unknown
speaker
25
percent
of
the
money
actually
goes
to
that
purpose,
25
percent.
unknown
speaker
i...
i--
unknown
speaker
--what
do
we--
unknown
speaker
--public
opinion
poll
as
to
whether
the
public
reasonably
understood
it
was
going
to
be
more
than
25
percent?
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
that
was
misleading,
but
it
is
not
misleading
to
say,
i'm
going
to...
this
money
is
going
to
go
to
this
charitable
cause
when,
in
fact,
you
acknowledge
many
charities
have
to
pay
substantial
amounts,
substantial
percentages
in
order
to,
in
order
to
get
organizations
to
solicit
for
them,
and
who...
who
is
to
say
that
the
25
percent
is
too
much.
i've
no
idea
whether
it
is.
unknown
speaker
you're
just
going
to
give
that
to
a
jury
and
leave
the
fundraising
to
be
liable
criminally
or
not,
depending
upon
whether
this
jury
thinks
that
25
percent
is
too
little
to
go,
or...
i...
i
just...
i'm
not
comfortable
with
that
at
all.
unknown
speaker
it
would
still
be
a
misrepresentation
even
if
they
had
good
reasons
for...
for
giving
the
fundraiser
90
percent
of
the
money.
unknown
speaker
it
would
still
be
a
misrepresentation,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
why...
why
is
there
no
fraud,
just
because
the
charge
is
reasonable?
fraud
exists
if
you
have
represented
to
the
public
something,
whether
the
something
you've
represented
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable
or
not.
if
the
public
is
unaware
that
95
percent
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
charge
for
this
kind
of
fundraising,
and
the
public
therefore
believes,
given
what
you've
said,
i'm
raising
money
for
vietnamese
orphans,
that
at
least
50
percent
of
that
is
going
to
go
to
vietnam,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
fraud
case.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
answer?
unknown
speaker
okay,
then...
then
why
don't
you
elaborate
on
your
answer.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
fine.
i
mean,
those
specific
misrepresentations
that
turned
out
to
be
false,
and
some
of
them
said
90
percent
is
going
to
go
there,
those
are
no
problems.
the
ones
we're
concerned
with
are
the...
the
fraud
allegations
that
are
sustained
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
this
money
is
going
to
go
to
this
cause
and,
in
fact,
only
15
percent
of
it
is
going
to
go
to
that
cause.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
able
to
show
to
the
jury
how
reasonable
it
is
for
this
particular
fundraiser
to...
to
retain
85
percent?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
why?
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
what
the
effect
of
the
representation
was
upon
the
public?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
go
to
materiality?
how
does
it
go
to
reasonable
reliance?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
donor--
--this
is
not
a
jury
trial,
is
it?
isn't
this
an
equity
proceeding?
everybody's
talking
about
the
jury
all
the
way
through,
but
i
think
it's
a--
--a
fraud
action
for
damages
is
a
jury--
--i
thought
it
was
a
proceeding
in...
before...
in
chancery
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
okay--
unknown
speaker
well
now,
i
don't
read
the
record
quite
that
way,
mr.
copilevitz.
the
affidavit
that
i
mentioned
earlier
on
page
169,
where
the...
the
woman
said
that
she
specifically
asked
the
question
and
was
told
90
percent
or
more
goes
to
the
vets,
that
strikes
me
as
a
straight
common
law
fraud
action.
are
you
saying
that
that...
that
the
state
is
prohibited
by
the
first
amendment
from
prosecuting
that
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if--
unknown
speaker
mr.
copilevitz,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
respond
to
justice
kennedy,
no,
that
it
doesn't
constitute
fraud
simply
to
refuse
to
tell
somebody
something
which,
if
he
knew,
he
would
not
have
made
the
contribution.
i
mean,
perhaps
someone
would
not
have
made
the
contribution
if
they
knew
what
an
inefficient
charity
this
particular
charity
was,
or
knew
that,
you
know,
for
the
past
several
years
there
had
been
a
lot
of
organizational
problems.
does
the
person
have
to
come
out
with
all
this
upon
pain
of
being
guilty
of
fraud?
unknown
speaker
certainly
you
don't
have
to
tell
someone
everything
which,
if
he
knew,
would
make
a
difference.
that
doesn't
constitute
fraud.
unknown
speaker
is
the
100
percent
tax
deductible
when
80
percent
goes
to
the
fundraiser?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
we
presume
that
just
as
some
charities
pay
too
much
for
fundraisers,
some
of
them
may
pay
too
much
for
their
corporate
offices.
they
may
enter
into
exorbitant
leases
that
they
could
have
gotten
for
half
of
that
had
they
been
better
negotiators.
surely
we
wouldn't
reduce
the
tax
deduction
because
some
of
those
expenses
were
unreasonable.
it
seems
to
me
that's
simply
the
way
the
tax
deduction
works.
if
it's
an
expense
of
the
charity,
it's
an
expense
of
the
charity.
unknown
speaker
mr.
copilevitz,
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
there
was
a
statement
that
the
defendants
had
made
no
affirmative
representation.
i
had
not
read
the
opinion
that
way.
could
you
either
locate
it
during
your
argument,
or
if
you
can't,
file
a
statement
afterwards
telling
us
on
what
page
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
that...
that
statement
appears?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
the--
unknown
speaker
--but
i
took
the--
unknown
speaker
and--
--well,
why
wouldn't--
--and
supporting
your,
what
you're
saying,
the
question
presented
gives
us
the
naked
question
if
the
85
percent
is
enough.
there...
there's
nothing
in
the
question
presented
that
talks
about
these
fringe
issues.
you're...
you're
dead
right
on
that.
unknown
speaker
--it's
all
there,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
would...
would
you
say
that
the
state
of
illinois
or
any
state
could
require
charities
every
6
months
to
report
the
percentage
of
money
going
to
telemarketers
and
the
percentage
going
to
the
ultimate
beneficiaries
in...
in
direct
payments
and
file
this
every
6
months?
unknown
speaker
i
assume
that
the
state
attorney
general
or
the
state
secretary
of
state
can,
indeed,
close
down
charities
which
are
being
used
as...
as
private
money-making
ventures.
aren't...
aren't...
isn't
that
possible?
unknown
speaker
not...
not
through
a
fraud
action,
but
through
investigating
the
books
of
the
charity.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
fundraiser
keeps
the
donor
list
itself,
and
it
seems
if
it
were
in
business
to
collect
for
the
charity,
rather
than
in
business
to
collect
for
itself,
it
would
surely
give
the
charity
the...
the
names
of
the
donors.
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
