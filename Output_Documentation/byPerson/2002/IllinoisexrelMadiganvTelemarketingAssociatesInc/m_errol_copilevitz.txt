mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court:
what
charities
spend
or
pay
for
fundraising,
whether
based
upon
a
percentage
or
otherwise,
are
a
measure
of
the
charity's
judgment
about
how
much
to
invest
in
persuasion,
a
fully
protected
activity
and
it
cannot
be
second-guessed.
the
first
amendment
guarantees
the
right
of
unpopular
organizations
to
zealously
pursue
their
causes.
the
petitioner
comes
to
this
court
having
pled
one
case,
but
having
argued
another
case.
the
petitioner's
denial
of
any
intent
to
impose
a
cost
limitation
on
charitable
appeals,
and
the
petitioner's
claim
that
its
only
purpose
is
to
combat
fraud,
is
simply
not
supported
in
this
record.
what
is
clear
is
that
the
petitioner's
claim
is
focused
exclusively
on
the
amount
of
the
respondents'
fee.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
that
violation
had
been
pled
in
this
case,
we
would
have
a
different
result
at
the
illinois
supreme
court.
paragraph
74,
at
page
104
of
the
appendix,
is
the
paragraph
that
incorporates
these
affidavits,
and
the
allegation
is
simply
that
if
the
fee
of
the
fundraiser
had
been
disclosed,
they
would
not
have
made
contributions.
the
illinois
supreme
court
specifically
found,
as
did
the
illinois
appellate
court
and
the
trial
court,
that
there
were
no
affirmative
misstatements
made.
in
order
for
the
petitioner's
case
to
be
sustained,
it
has
to
have
two
legs.
we
know
that
cost
alone
is
not
an
indication
of
fraud,
so
it
has
to
have
some
other
positive
statement.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
well,
you're
dealing
with
the
lesser
of
two
evils.
high
undisclosed
fundraising
costs
are
a
lesser
evil
than
compelling
a
point
of
solicitation
disclosure
of
information
that
is
inaccurate,
that
this
court
has
held
is
not
material,
and
risk
creating
for
smaller--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--the
percentage
doesn't--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--no,
because
the
whole
concept
is
built
on
the
only
return
the
nonprofit
received
is
the
net
dollars,
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
riley,
there
is
a
wide
range
of
values
that
the
organization
receives
from
the
appeal
itself.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
no.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
i
agree.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
is
it
tax
deductible?
yes.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
that
presume...
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
the
organization
receives
a
benefit
beyond
the
net
dollars.
the
purpose
of
the
organization,
and
if
you
look
at
the
appendix,
article
5
of
the
articles
of
incorporation
at
joint
appendix
16
says
that
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
this
organization
is
to
increase
the
community
awareness
of
the
problems
faced
by
vietnam
veterans.
the
contract
that
my
client
had
with
the
vietnam
veterans
incorporated
a
part
of
that.
it
incorporated
a
magazine.
it
incorporated
an
800
number.
it
incorporated
distributing
information.
the
difference
between
the
15
cents
on
the
dollar
that
was
received
and
the
fee
is
value
that
this
organization
received,
so
certainly
the
entire
amount
of
any
contribution
is
tax
deductible,
and
it's
not
fair
or
proper
to
say
that
the
organization
received
no
benefit
other
than
the
dollars.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
yes.
an
organization
like
mothers
against
drunk
driving
exists
to
advocate
a
change
of
attitude.
they
could
well
enter
into
a
contract
that
says,
every
cent
you
raise
i
am
giving
to
you
to
call
that
many
more
people
in
order
to...
to
deliver
our
message,
in
which
case
they
would
have
100
percent
cost
of
fundraising
under
the
approach
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
and
they
would
be
justified,
and
your
gifts
to
that
organization
would
be
fully
deductible,
as
they
should
be,
and
they
have
the
first
amendment
right
to
spend
what
they
believe--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--you
presume
that
the
contract
is
made
at
arm's
length
in
the
marketplace.
unpopular
charities
have
the
same
right
to
have
their
message
circulated
as
does
a
popular
organization.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
and
the
charity
may
have
all
manners
of
expense
that
may
be
relevant
to
one
donor
but
not
be
relevant
to
another.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
it
appears
in
page
348
of
the
opinion,
and
i
quote:
further,
vietnow
has
never
expressed
dissatisfaction
with
the
fundraising
services
provided
by
the
defendants,
and
there
is
no
allegation
that
defendants
made
affirmative
misstatements
to
potential
donors.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
but
the
affidavits
were
inherently
unreliable.
they're...
the--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--it's
not...
those...
those
affidavits
are
incorporated
for
the
sole
purpose
of
demonstrating
that
there
was
not
a
disclosure
of
the
fee
paid.
if
those
affidavits
were
true
and
correct,
each
one
of
them
would
have
supported
an
independent
action
in
violation
of
a
specific
statute
in
the
illinois
charitable
association
act--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--it's
not
in
the
case.
there
are
no
allegations...
those
would
have
constituted
violations
of
specific
sections
of
the
statute.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
there
was
no
allegation
in
the
complaint.
the
only
place
they're
found
are
in
the
affidavits
which
are
incorporated
as
a
reference
that
the
fee
was
not
disclosed
and,
had
it
been,
they
would
not
have
given
it.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
that's
the
sole
purpose
of
it.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
chief
justice's
question.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
yes,
sir.
what
they
said
is
that
the
only
allegation
was
that
the
fees
were
excessive
and
they
weren't
disclosed,
that
there
was
no
allegation
of
any
affirmative
misrepresentation.
they
did
not
say
that
an
action
couldn't
be
brought
for
fraud
if
there
was
an
affirmative
misrepresentation.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
well,
maybe
i'm
not
clear,
then.
what
i
am
saying,
that
high
fund-raising
costs
alone,
and
the
failure
to
disclose
those
costs,
consistent
with
schaumburg,
munson,
and
riley,
are
not
an
indication
of
fraud
in
and
of
themselves.
the
state
needed
two
legs
to
stand
on.
they
might
have
had
the
high
fundraising
costs,
but
they
needed
some
form
of
misrepresentation
connected
with
the
use
of
the
money,
and
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
found,
what
the
appellate
court
found,
and
what
the
trial
court
found
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
that
the
second
leg
did
not
exist,
and
therefore,
the
claim
could
not
stand,
because
to
do
so
would
have
been
contrary
to
this
court's
holdings--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--thank
you.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
those
violations
of
the
statute
are
certainly
subject
to
prosecution.
that's
not
the
case
that
was
brought
by
the
state
of
illinois.
they
amended
the
complaint
two
times.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
the--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--the
illinois
supreme
court
found
as
a
matter
of
law
that
those
affidavits
were
not
part
of
the
complaint,
and
this
court
certainly
has
the
authority
to--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--that's
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
found--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
it's
the
quote
that
i
just
read,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
well,
my
reservation
in
answering
the
question
yes
is,
again,
you
are
focused
simply
on
the
value
of
the
net
dollars
that
are
received.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
well,
i
would...
i
would
refer
to
the
decision
of
judge
posner
in
the
ucc
case,
where
we
had
virtually
that
very
set
of
facts,
and
the
solicitor
for
the
internal
revenue
service
proposed
that,
in
dealing
with
how
would
we
know,
the
notice
issue
and
the
standard,
is
there
would
be
a
case-by-case
analysis,
and
it
would
evolve,
and
judge
posner,
i
believe
correctly
determined
that
that's
no
standard
at
all,
and
if
there's
no
standard,
we're
back
to
the
lesser
evil.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
well--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--i
don't
believe
that
you
can
measure
the
worth
of
an
organization
based
upon
its
financial
efficiency.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
yes,
sir,
and
there
are
some
states
that
do
require
that.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
there
is
statutory...
yes,
your
honor,
there's
statutory
authority--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--yes,
sir,
and
under
section--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--well--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--i
would
agree,
and
i
would
point
to
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
at
the
footnote
referring
to
the
brief
that
was
filed
by
disabled
american
veterans,
explaining
the
problem
of
donor
acquisition
mailings,
that
it
can
cost
$1
or
more
to
acquire
$1,
and
that
that
should
be
something
that
the
petitioner
should
give
deference
to,
and
in
footnote
13
of
the
petitioner's
reply,
they
took
exactly
the
opposite
position
and
said
the
fact
that
it
was
donor
acquisition
mailings,
trying
to
acquire
new
donors,
was
not
a
reason
to
set
aside
the
principles
that
they've
enunciated
in
their
complaint.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
yes,
sir.
the
state
of
illinois
has
a
series
of...
of
disclosure
requirements.
they're
content-based,
neutral
disclosures.
you
must,
before
you
ask
for
a
donation
in
illinois,
if
you're
a
compensated
professional
fundraiser,
disclose
your
professional
status.
you
must
also
disclose
that
you
can
obtain
copies
of
financial
records
for
the
organization
from
the
office
of
the
attorney
general.
you
must
also
answer,
if
asked,
what
your
fee
is.
you
must
disclose
it.
you
must
disclose,
if
asked,
what
portion
of
the
monies
will
go
to
the
charitable
organization.
you
must
disclose
the
primary
purpose
of,
the
charitable
purpose
of
the
organization.
the
state
of
illinois
can
publish
reports,
the
state
of
illinois
maintains
a
web
site.
there
are
800
numbers.
there
are...
there
is
a
requirement
that,
prior
to
anyone
parting
with
consideration,
in
the
mail
piece
that
is
sent,
when
you
are
sitting
in
the
privacy
of
your
own
home,
having
made
simply
a
pledge
in
the
mail,
in
writing,
there
is
a
disclosure
that
you
can
obtain
copies
of
the
financial
information.
there
is
a
disclosure--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--yes,
your
honor,
because
it's
the
breathing
space
of
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
and
riley
and
schaumburg
and
munson
that
we
require.
it's
the
lesser
of
two
evils.
a
compelled
point
of
solicitation
disclosure
will
disproportionately
adversely
affect
smaller,
newer,
and
less
popular
charities.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
i
would
point
to
the
concurring
opinion
written
by
justice
scalia
in
the
riley
case
that
the...
that
it's
the
normal
presumption
of
people
to
believe
that
someone
is
being
compensated.
they
know
when
they
get
something
in
the
mail
that
you
had
to
pay
for
the
stamps,
you
had
to
pay
for
the
printing.
you
have
in
illinois
a
step
further,
the
disclosure
of
the
professional
status
and
the
information
before
you
part
with
any
consideration
how
you
can
obtain
all
the
information
if
cost--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--excuse
me.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
that's
a
subject
of
contract,
and
i
would
suggest
that
that's
something
illinois
could
address.
there
are
state
laws
in
new
hampshire
and
arkansas
that
i
can
recall
off
the
top
of
my
head
that
specifically
require
as
a
condition
of
a
contract
that
the
list
and
the
names
be
made
available.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
this
contract
wasn't
entered
into
at
arm's
length
and,
in
fact,
the
attorney
general's
web
site
cites
the
percentage
of
this
contract
as
being
the
common
amount
that
professional
fundraisers
routinely
charge,
and
as
the
court
addressed
in
riley,
that
the
state's
paternalistic
instinct
in
protecting
attorneys--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--it
can
be.
that...
it's
on
the
web
site
of
the
attorney
general,
that
professional
fundraiser
fees
generally
run
between
80
and
90
percent.
there's
also
footnoted
in
the
brief
a
reference
to
a
report
that
was
done
that
veterans
groups
are
among
the
lowest
receiving
organizations
because
of
the
nature
of
their
appeal,
and
nation-wide
averaged
17
percent,
and
in
this
case
they
allege
15
percent,
but
the
reality
is
something
different
than
that.
because
of
the
magazines
that
were
published
in
the
last
contract
they
got
$20,000
in
addition
to
their
percentage.
if
no
phone
call
had
been
made,
they
would
have
received
100
percent
of
the
money.
they
got
the
benefit
of
a
nationwide
800
number.
they
got
the
benefit
of
2,200
magazines.
they
got
the
opportunity
to
talk
to
nine
of--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--well,
it...
it's
for
me
in
the
breathing
space
concept,
but
what
they
allege
is,
in
the
complaint
is
that
they
raised
money
for
the
charitable
purpose.
what
they
don't
allege
is
that
no
money
went
to
the
charitable
purpose.
it's
a
question
of
degrees.
again,
we
come
back
down
to
what
portion
of
the
gross
dollar
in
hard
dollars
went
to
the
program
purpose.
what
we
can't--
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
--no,
they
would...
there
was
a
value...
the...
one
of
the
primary
program
services
was
to
raise
the
awareness
of
the
plight
of
the
vietnam
veteran
and,
as
a
result
of
a
phone
call,
9
out
of
10
people
called
do
not
make
a
contribution,
but
the
organization
got
the
benefit
of
every
one
of
those
conversations,
and
maybe
next
year
or
next
month
they
got
a
bequest,
or
they
got
a
donation
of
a
car,
or
they
acquired
a
donor
by
direct
mail.
they're
only
focusing
on
one
campaign.
they
don't
look
at
every
campaign.
in
the
footnote
in
the
dav,
referring
to
them,
they
did
not
limit
themselves.
it
can
be
campaign-by-campaign.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
no,
sir.
mr.
m.
errol
copilevitz
thank
you.
