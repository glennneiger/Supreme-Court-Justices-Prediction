well,
would
this
prosecution
have
been
brought
if
the
fee,
if
the
amount
given
to
the
charity
had
been
more
substantial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
anyone
know
when
the
attorney
general
would
be
likely
to
charge
them?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is...
is
there
an
intent
requirement,
an
intent
to
defraud
requirement
under
the
illinois
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
the
instruction,
though,
to
the
jury
be
under
the
illinois
law?
what
must
the
state
prove
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
let
me
ask
you
this.
is...
is
the
state
taking
the
position
that
there
is
a
material
misrepresentation
of
fact
here
because
the
amount
given
to
the
charity
was
a
trifling
amount?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that...
is
that
how
you
bill
the
material
misrepresentation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
your...
the
respondent's
brief
says,
well,
the
governor
had
a
charity
ball,
and
just
17
percent--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--was
kept
and
no
prosecution.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
