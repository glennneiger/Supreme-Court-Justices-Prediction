mr.

william
h.
rehnquist
but
one
of
your
affidavits
says
that
one
of
the
solicitees
expressly
asked
and
was
told
that
90
percent
or
more
goes
to
the
vets.
now,
certainly
that's
a
classic
misrepresentation,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
it
has
a
reasonable
understanding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
want
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
mr.
huszagh?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
clement,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
copilevitz,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
supreme
court
of
illinois
didn't
go
off
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
separate
statute
regulating
solicitation,
and
that
therefore
you
couldn't
have
a
common
law
fraud
action
in
illinois.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
that
these
allegations
would
have
been
a...
a
violation
of
a
specific
statute
governing
fraud,
governing
charitable
solicitation,
but
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
didn't
say
that
because
there's
a
statute
governing
solicitation
you
could
not
bring
a
common
law
fraud
action
in
this
case.
what
they
said
was
that
the
first
amendment
prohibits
you
from
doing
it,
as
i
understood
their
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
said
that
in
this
opinion,
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
give
me--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
give
me
the
citation
in
the
petition...
the
petition
for
the
certiorari.
if
you
can't
find
it
now,
file
it
with...
file
it
with
the
clerk
later.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
copilevitz.
mr.
huszagh,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
huszagh.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
01-1806,
illinois
ex
rel.
madigan
versus
telemarketing
associates
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
