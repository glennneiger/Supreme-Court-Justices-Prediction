mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
cannot
be
true
that
charitable
solicitors
are
free
to
commit
fraud
just
because
they
are
charitable
solicitors.
under
long-established
common
law
fraud
principles,
it
is
unquestionably
fraudulent
to
induce
someone
to
make
a
gift
of
money
by
saying
it
will
be
used
for
a
specific
charitable
purpose
when,
in
fact,
only
a
nominal
amount
goes
to
that
purpose
and
the
solicitor
keeps
the
vast
majority.
the
first
amendment
does
not--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--displace
these
principles.
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
25
percent
may
or
may
not
be
a
misrepresentation,
depending
upon
what
the
public
was
told
about
the
ultimate
purpose
of--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--if
the
public--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--well--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--if
the
public
reasonably
understands
that
significantly
more
than
that
amount
goes
to
that
purpose--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--then
it
would
be
a
misrepresentation
to
rely
upon--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--that
assumption--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--assumptions
form
a
fundamental
part
of
human
communication,
assumptions
about
the
meaning
of
language,
assumptions...
assumptions
about
events
and
conditions.
if
somebody
were
to
say
that
they
were
soliciting
money
to...
for...
for
the
family
of
people
who
died
on
september
11,
and
the
people
they
were
referring
to
were
their
parents
who
died
of
natural
causes
in
topeka,
kansas,
on
september
11
of
1995,
that's
a
misrepresentation,
because
people
are
entitled
to
make
a
reasonable--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--assumption
about
what
that
language
means.
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--i...
i
think
the
court
needs
to
distinguish
between
two
different
types
of
circumstances.
one
is
the
fact
that
there
may
be
legitimate
reasons
why
a
charity
could
have
expenses
above
a
certain
level.
it
could
be
that
they're
an
unpopular
charity.
it
could
be
that
it's
a
charity
that's
small,
or
has
recently
started
up,
but
those
are
the
types
of
reasons
that
the
court
used
to
invalidate
laws
that
declared
expenses
above
a
certain
threshold
to...
to
establish
that
the
charity
was
a
sham
entirely.
those
don't
negate--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--and--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--and
that's
my
point,
that
the
first
amendment
should
not
displace
that
principle
where
misrepresentations
are
determined
based
upon
whether
the
defendant
made
a
material
representation
of
fact,
and
it's...
i
is
no
different
from--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--there's
a
substantial
likelihood,
or
there's
less
likelihood
that
such
a
prosecution
would
bought,
been
brought,
because--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--i
think
really
the
ultimate
question
is
not
whether
they're
going
to
know
whether
the
attorney
general
is
going
to
bring
the
case,
but
whether
they've
committed
fraud.
ultimately,
the
attorney
general
is
not
going
to
prosecute
every
case
of
fraud
that
exists,
and--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--as
to
what
we've
alleged
for
common
law
fraud,
yes,
there
is,
and
we've
made
that
allegation
as...
with
respect
to
all
of
the
statutory
antifraud
counts
as
well,
and
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
concern
about
the
uncertainty
as
to
whether
a
specific
statement
may
be
a
misrepresentation,
depending
upon
the
inability
to
predict
exactly
what
the
public
may
know,
then
certainly
there's
no
such
objection
if
the
defendant,
it
can
be
proved
knew
that
they
were
creating
a
false
impression.
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
yes,
it
is,
but
our
position
goes
further,
which
is
that
there
is
no
constitutional
value
in
intentional
half-truths
or
artificial,
contrived
ways
of
stating
something
that
may
be
literally
true--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--i
would
agree
that
if
that
were
the
conclusion
as
to
what
would
occur
in...
in...
if
the
law
that
we
advocate
were
permitted,
then
the
court
would
effectively
be
forced
to
reevaluate
the
validity
of
its
precedents,
and
we
are
not--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--but
in
this
case
we
are
not
urging
the
court
to
do
so,
but
it
is
our...
our
premise
that
the...
that
that
conclusion
does
not
necessarily
follow,
and
it
has
not
been
established
in
this
case.
ultimately,
these
speakers
know
how
much
is
going
to
be
used
for
various
purposes,
or
they
certainly
have
the
ability
to
know
that,
and
they
are
the
masters
of
their
own
speech,
and
to
suggest
that
they
have
no
ability
to
know
what
the
public
is
going
to
believe,
or
be
led
to
believe
when
they
make
specific
representations
about
seeking
money
for
charity
i
think
is
somewhat
unrealistic.
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
but
i
think
that
the...
the
question
then
becomes
whether
the
court
should
displace
common
law
fraud
principles,
which
already
provide
a
measure
of
breathing
room
for
that
type
of
uncertainty.
ultimately--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--no.
it
is
important
for
the
jury
to
decide
what,
in
fact,
the
donating
public
did
believe
as
to
how
much
was
going
to
be
used
for
the
purposes
described,
that
this
is
not
some
normative
imposition
by
the
government
as
to
what's
reasonable.
this
is
an
adjudicatory
process
to
determine
what
the
understanding
of
the
public
was,
and
ultimately--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--the
state
would
have
to
prove
that
there
were
a
material
misrepresentation
of
fact,
leaving
aside
for
a
moment
the
intent
requirement.
the
material
misrepresentation
of
fact
includes
three
elements
which
provide
the
defendant
with
a
breathing
space
for
some
of
the
uncertainties
that
the
court
seems
to
be
sensitive
to.
first,
the
assertion
must
be
factual,
not
some
type
of
representation
like,
this
charity
is
a
humdinger
that
can't
be
disproved
in
a
court
of
law.
the
interpretation,
the
meaning
to
that
statement
has
to
be
a
reasonable
one,
which
is
an
objective
requirement
subject
to
supervision
by
the
courts,
so
if
somebody
believed
that
150
percent
of
every
donation
was
going
to
go
to
charity,
that
is
objectively
unreasonable,
and
the
court
would
eliminate
that.
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
no,
because
that's
not
reasonable.
it's
not
reasonable--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--it's
not
reasonable
for
the
public
to
assume--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--the...
there
is
no--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--it's
what
the
government
proves
that
the
donating
public
understood
based
upon
what
they
were
told,
what
they
were
reasonably
led
to
believe.
that
may
include
their
background
assumptions
about
how
much
normally
goes
to
fundraising
costs
or
other
administrative
overhead,
and
that
can
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
charity,
as
well
as
the
statements
made
by
the
defendants.
the
other
elements,
to
finish
my
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
and
justice
kennedy's
questions,
is
that
there
is
in
addition
a
materiality
requirement.
it
is
not
enough
that
the
statement
be
technically
false,
like
a
difference
between
95
percent
and
93
percent.
the
difference
has
to
be
material,
and
that
again
provides
that
certain
falsity
will
go
unprohibited
because
the
materiality
requirement
already
gives
a
buffer
zone.
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
well--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
i...
i
think
there
are
two
basic
answers
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
and
one
is
that
the
reasonableness
of
the
manner
in
which
the
expenditures
are
made
is
not
a
proper
subject
of
the
government's
paternalistic
bureaucratic
oversight
to
second-guess
that
judgment,
and
i
think
the
court
made
that
clear
both
in
munson
and
more
specifically
in
riley,
and
we
are
not
arguing
that
the...
whether
the...
the
plaintiff's
fraud
claim
for
actual
specific
misrepresentations
turns...
they
will
win
or
lose,
depending
upon
whether
there
is
some
reasonableness
element
to
the
manner
of
the
expenditures--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--well--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--but
that
leads
to--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--that
leads
to
the
second
point
that
i
was
going
to
make.
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
and
i
don't
dispute
that,
but--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--that
is
my
answer
to
the
second
part
of
justice
breyer's
question.
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
no,
i--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--no,
it
is
not.
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
let
me
deal
with
the
nature
conservancy
first.
i
think
that's
an
example
in
which
the
public
who
gives
money
to
the
nature
conservancy
understands
realistically
that
their
money
is
going
to
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
buying
land,
and
to
suggest
in
some
artificial
sense
by
a
prosecutor
that
no,
really
they
thought
it
was
going
to
be
used
in
an
accounting
format
to
be
treated
as...
as
an
expense
as
opposed
to
a
capital
acquisition
establishes
fraud
is...
is
simply
unrealistic.
the
other
example
again
focuses
upon
the
specific
nature
of
the
representation
made,
and
there...
there
is
a
wide
variety
of
differences,
but
if
the
representation
is
made
that
the
money
is
going
to
be
used
to
feed
hungry
orphans
in
vietnam,
it
does
not
somehow
become,
per
se,
nonfraudulent
if,
in
fact,
those
funds
are
being
used
to...
to
get
out
the
word
about
the
plight
of
vietnam
veterans,
which
is
different,
and
materially
different
from
what
the
representation
was
to
the
donors.
i
think
that
is
our
basic--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--it...
yes,
because
it
was
a
trifling
amount--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--well,
materiality
doesn't
always
have
to
rise
to
the
level
that
there
will
only
be
a
trifling
amount
that
would
go
to
the
charity,
but
there
was
a
significant--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--yes.
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
well,
i...
i
don't--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--i'd
rather
not
use
my
time
to
try
and
explain
the
misleading--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--impression
given
by
that
example.
let
me
just
say
that
the
facts
of
that
case
are
dramatically
different
than
were
represented,
and
the...
the
argument
that
there
has
been
any
impermissible
selective
prosecution
in
this
case
based
upon
some
type
of
discriminatory
element
that
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
that.
if
there
were
such
a
case,
the
court
has
said
that
there
is
a
reserved
ability
to
do
so.
what
i
would--
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
--yes,
i
would.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
s.
huszagh
i'd
like
to
first
correct
two
clarifications
in
the
record.
in
fact,
the
illinois
supreme
court
never
said
that
the
affidavit
should
not
properly
be
treated
as
part
of
the
complaint.
they
refer
to
the
affidavits,
but
our
allegations
stand
on
their
own
without
the
need
for
those
affidavits,
which
would
simply
be
an
elaboration
of
the
types
of
misrepresentations
made
to
donors.
a
second,
the
web
site
that
the
illinois
attorney
general
keeps
does
not
hold
up
90
percent
kept
by
fundraisers
as
the
ordinary
and
usual
thing
that's
regularly
practiced
in
this
area.
they
indicate
that
as
another
one
of
several
egregious
examples
that
people
should
be
warned
against,
but
that
is
not
the
only
weapon
they
should
have
in
their
arsenal
against
actual
fraud.
this
case
is
not
a
claim
based
upon
a
mere
nondisclosure
of
a
high
fee.
it
is
a
claim
based
upon
a
particular
instance
of
actual
deception
based
upon
statements
made
to
donors
that
constitute
misrepresentations
under
the
common
law
of
fraud,
not
explicit
misstatements
as
the
illinois
supreme
court
said,
or
affirmative
misstatements,
not
explicit
lies,
but
misrepresentations
in
the
form
of
half-truths,
and
we
ask
this
court
not
to
hold
that
half-truths
are
constitutionally
protected.
i
think
the
court
said
as
much
in
milkovich
and
the
masson
cases,
and
no
different
rule
is
warranted
here.
there
is
that
semantic
distinction.
let
me
point
out,
however,
that
the
key
allegation
in
this
complaint,
in
the
body
of
the
text
at
joint
appendix
page
9,
paragraph
34,
says
that
the
effect
of
representations
that
were
made
was
that
people
were
told
that
a
significant
amount
of
each
dollar
donated
would
be
paid
over
to
vietnow,
and
the
defendants
knew
that
was
false
because
15
cents
or
less
of
each
dollar
would
be
given
to
vietnow
for
its
purposes.
the
allegation
is
that
people
were
told
that
their
money
was
going
to
be
paid
to
vietnow
and
used
to
buy
food
baskets,
to
provide
job
training
for
veterans.
that
is
an
actual
representation.
whether
it
constitutes
a
misrepresentation
turns
upon
whether
it
reasonably
led
people
to
believe
something
that
was
false,
and
we
ask
the
court
to
continue
to
uphold
those
principles
in
this
context.
there
is
no
plausible
claim
that
in
this
case
what
these
defendants
are
alleged
to
have
done
is
beyond
the
state's
power
to
prohibit
by
a
properly
drafted
law,
that
these
circumstances
are
egregious,
and
there
is
also
no
possible
claim
that...
that
any
law
invoked
here
cannot
be
applied
against
anybody.
the
fallback
position
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
is
that
the
court
should
take
the
draconian
step
of
saying
that
unless
there
is
an
explicit
misrepresentation
of
fact,
not
an
implied
one,
that
there
should
be
blanket
immunity
for
charitable
fundraisers
to
lead
people
to
believe
that
their
money
is
going
to
be
used
for
specific
purposes
and
have
no
liability
if
that
is
1
percent
true.
that
is
not
something
that's
justified
by
the
first
amendment.
they
have
conjured
up
dire
scenarios
about
all
sorts
of
charities
disappearing
from
the
landscape
simply
by
the
type
of
examples
that
they
have
given
for
a
chilling
effect.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that,
and
there
is
nothing
in
common
experience
to
show
that,
but
what
they're
asking
the
court
is
to
say
no,
it's
not
enough
for
as-applied
claims
of
that
variety
to
be
brought
in
other
cases,
but
that
there
should
be
no
prosecution
ever.
the
state
is
categorically
prohibited
from
bringing
a
fraud
claim
in
such
circumstances.
that
is
not
a
value
that
the
first
amendment
supports.
the
first
amendment
value
that's
most
important
here
is
the
donor's
right
to
be
able
to
make
informed
decisions.
i
see
the
light's
on.
