well,
what...
what
you
say
would
be
very
impressive
and
would
eliminate
my
problems
if
you
were
willing
to
go
further
and
say,
whenever
you
say,
i'm
raising
money
for
vietnamese
orphans,
oh,
100
percent
of
the
money
you
collect
is
understood
by
the
public
to
be
going
to
vietnamese
orphans,
but
you're
not
willing
to
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
that's
not
reasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
25
percent.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
does...
what
does
the
judge
instruct
the
jury?
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
if
you
think
it's
reasonable
to
send...
or...
or
what?
no,
no,
it
wouldn't
be
whether
it's
reasonable.
it's
what
you
think
the
average
person
would
have
thought,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
do
have
to
write
an
opinion
though,
you
know.
