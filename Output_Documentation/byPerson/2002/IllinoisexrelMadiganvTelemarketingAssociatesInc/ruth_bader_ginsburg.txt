but
isn't
that
essentially,
mr.
clement,
what
is
happening
here?
that
is,
these
are...
to
the
extent
that
these
are
telephone
calls,
and
say,
like
you
to
contribute
to
vietnam,
and
this
money's
going
to
be
spent
on
veterans,
and
that's
the
extent
of
it,
it
seems
that
the
illinois
attorney
general
is
measuring
the
decision
whether
to
bring
a
fraud
claim
by
the
percent
that
goes
to
the
charity
in
comparison
to
this...
this
portion
that
goes
to
the
fundraiser.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
ask
a
question
and
you
give
a
false
answer,
the
two
examples
were
given...
i
was
struck
by
another...
one
of
the
affidavits'
comments.
this
is
the
one
at
joint
appendix
1...
182.
the
receipt
says
it's
tax
deductible,
and
now
the
donor
asks,
on
being
told
that
only
20
percent
went
to
the
charity,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
a
question
that's
not
entirely
hypothetical?
suppose
congress,
trying
to
get
a
handle
on
fundraising
operations
that
are
really
operating
to
line
the
pockets
of
the
fundraiser,
rather
than
for
the
benefit
of
the
charity,
would
say,
if
more
than
40
percent
of
what
is
collected
goes
to
the
fundraiser,
then
the
donor
will
get
a
tax
deduction
only
for
the
amount
that
actually
goes
to
the
charity.
in
other
words,
taking
your
theory,
up
to
40
percent,
but
saying
if
the
fundraiser
gets
more
than
40
percent,
then
the
donor
will
not
get
a
deduction
for
everything
the
donor
gave,
but
only
for
the
part
that
went
to
the
charity,
would
that
be...
would
that
violate
the
first
amendment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm...
i'm
sorry,
i
don't...
that
may
be
the
purpose
of
the
organization,
so
that's
for
the
charitable
purpose,
to
spread
the
word
about
drunk
driving,
but
the
example
that
i
gave
you
is,
the
fundraiser
says,
you're
not
a
very
appealing
charity.
if
you
want
us
to
raise
money
for
you,
we're
going
to
charge
a
great
deal,
and
you
get...
you'll
get
something,
where
if
you
were
doing
it
on
your
own,
you'd
get
nothing.
in
that
kind
of
case,
not
the
example
of
madd,
where
the
word
about
drunk
driving
is
being
spread,
but
just,
the
economics
of
it
is
that
the
fundraiser
takes
80
percent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
is...
this
case...
something
you
said
i
thought
was
not
quite
right.
this
case
went
off
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
so
there
was
no
trial.
there
was
no
findings
of
anything
and,
given
the
liberality
of
complaint
amendments,
even
if
you're
right
that
they
didn't
make
those
allegations,
they
surely
could,
so
one
thing
is
to
say,
i
thought
your
position
was,
no
matter
what
they
said
in
the
complaint,
this
kind
of
operation
must
be
allowed
to
go
on,
not
simply
that
they...
they...
there's
a
defect
in
pleadings
here,
but
no
claim
could
be
stated,
not
that
these...
these
pleadings
didn't
state
a
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
can...
you
said
many
times
you
can
ask,
you
can
obtain.
it
seems
that,
then,
the
sophisticated
person
is
protected,
the
sophisticated
person
will
ask,
but
the
person
who
isn't,
who
doesn't
know,
i
mean,
your...
your
position
is,
it's
okay,
if
asked,
must
tell,
but
if
doesn't
ask,
then
it's
against
the
first
amendment
to
require
a
statement
of
how
much
goes
to
the
fundraising?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
disproportionately
affect
donors
who
are
unsophisticated,
because
those
are
the
ones,
by
and
large,
that
don't
ask.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it...
is
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
looking
at
this
picture
of
this
fundraiser,
one
of
the
things
that
was
alleged,
it
seemed
to
me,
is
odd.
it
said
that
the
fundraiser
does
not
give
the
names
of
the
donor
to
the
charity,
to
vietnow.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
we
going
on
that
again?
that
this
is
the
common
amount
that
fundraisers
usually
charge,
80
percent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
charges
by
the
attorney
general
of
illinois
that
a
for-profit
fund
raising
enterprise,
engaged
in
fraudulent
solicitation
for
a
charitable
organization,
underlying
the
suit
of
contract
between
the
fund
raisers,
i
will
refer
to
as
telemarketers,
and
a
charity,
vietnow
whose
purpose
is
to
promote
the
welfare
of
vietnam
veterans
and
their
families.
the
contract
provides
that
85
cents
of
each
dollar
collected
would
be
retained
by
the
fund
raisers.
the
illinois
attorney
general
charged
the
telemarketers
defrauded
the
public
by
falsely
representing
that
money
donated
would
fund
specific
endeavors,
for
example,
thanksgiving
baskets,
job
training
and
rehabilitation
services,
paying
bills
and
rent
owed
by
disabled
veterans,
when
in
fact
15
cents
or
less
of
each
dollar
donated
would
be
available
for
such
purposes.
the
illinois
supreme
court
ruled
that
this
suit
could
not
be
maintained.
that
court
relied
on
three
decisions
of
this
court
holding
incompatible
with
the
free
speech
secured
by
the
first
amendment
state
and
local
laws
are
prohibited
charitable
solicitations
when
fund
raising
fees
exceeded
a
prescribed
reasonable
limit.
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
first
amendment
secures
the
right
to
engage
in
charitable
solicitation,
but
it
does
not
shield
fraud.
our
prior
decisions
held
that
high
fund
raising
costs,
without
more,
do
not
establish
fraud.
we
have
also
held
that
the
mere
failure
to
volunteer
the
fund
raiser's
fee
when
contacting
a
potential
contributor
standing
alone
is
insufficient
to
state
a
claim
for
fraud.
we
adhere
to
those
rulings,
but
we
rid
the
illinois
attorney
general's
complaint
in
a
light
favorable
to
the
complainant
as
we
generally
do
when
a
complaint
is
attacked
as
insufficient
at
the
very
outset
of
the
case.
so
reading
the
complaints
before
us,
we
are
satisfied
that
the
charges
against
telemarketers
have
a
solid
core.
in
affirmative
statements
telemarketers
made
intentionally
misleading
donors
regarding
the
deployment
of
their
contribution.
we
cast
no
doubt
on
the
legitimacy
of
the
charity's
public
awareness
campaigns
or
advocacy
or
information
dissemination
endeavors,
but
we
clarify
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
disarms
state
from
assuring
that
their
residence
are
positioned
to
make
informed
choices
about
their
charitable
giving.
just
as
states
may
require
charities
and
fund
raisers
to
file
detail
of
financial
disclosure
forms
that
may
communicate
that
information
to
the
public.
so
states
may
stop
fund
raisers
from
misleading
potential
donors
into
believing
a
substantial
portion
of
their
contribution
with
fund
specific
programs
or
services
knowing
full
well
that
the
line
share
of
contributions
would
be
otherwise
employed.
we
stress
that
in
fraud
actions
of
the
type
at
issue
here,
the
state
bears
the
full
burden
of
proof.
furthermore,
under
illinois
case
law
false
statement
alone
is
insufficient
to
subject
fund
raisers
to
fraud
liability,
rather
the
complainant
here,
the
illinois
attorney
general
must
show
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
misrepresentation
was
knowingly
false
was
intended
to
mislead
the
listener
and
successfully
did
so.
proof
requirements
of
this
order
in
other
context
notably
actions,
for
defamation
of
public
officials,
have
been
held
to
provide
sufficient
breathing
room
for
protected
speech.
the
court's
opinion
is
unanimous.
justice
scalia
has
in
addition
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
