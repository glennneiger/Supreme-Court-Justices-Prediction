the
thing
i
don't
understand,
though,
is
the
difference
between
good
charities
and
bad
charities
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
have
a
particle
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
the
state
was
a...
was
a
misrepresentation
or
not.
you
can
get
85
percent
from
a
good
charity,
and
85
percent
from
a
bad
charity
and
keep
it,
but
the
statement
to
the
public
is
equally
misleading
in
either
case.
i
mean,
maybe
that's
not
enough,
but
maybe
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
see
how
the
character
of
the
charity
has
any
bearing
on
the...
on
the
kind
of...
whether
there's
fraud
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
arguing
that
it's
a
good
charity,
and
i'll...
i'll...
we'll
assume
that
for
purposes
of
the
decision,
that
they're...
they're
perfect,
but
it
still
seems
to
me--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you've
raised
the
suggestion
that
maybe
we
should
use
the
new
york
times
standard,
and
if
that
were
the
case,
would
it
not
be
arguable
that
your
people
knowingly
made
these
statements
with
the
understanding
they
would
believe
that
they
were
literally
true,
and
that
there
was
not
an
over...
you
know,
that
the...
that
the
charity
was
going
to
get
a
larger
amount
of
the
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
the
new
york
times
standard
might
cut
against
you,
in
other
words.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the
question
is
how...
how
true
was
the
statement?
what
is
the
reasonable
understanding
of
the
person
who
listened
to
this
solicitation?
i
think
everybody
sort
of
agrees
that
if
they
knew
the
facts,
they
wouldn't
have
given
the
money
and,
as
justice
kennedy
suggests,
therefore
they
were
misled,
and
then
the
new
york
times
standard
suggests
to
me
that
you
knew
they
would
be
misled,
because
you
say
it
in
your
own
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
an
argument
that
the
85
percent
is
an
incorrect
figure.
that's...
then
i
think
the
case
that's
presented
by
the...
the
certiorari
position
is,
assume
that
85
percent
is
the
correct
figure,
then,
is
it...
you
know,
is
it
fraud?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
