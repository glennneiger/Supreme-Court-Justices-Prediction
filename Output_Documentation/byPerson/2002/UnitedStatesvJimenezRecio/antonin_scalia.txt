it's
the
opposite
of
a
choate
offense,
i
assume,
is
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
when
one
of
them
has
abandoned
efforts.
i
mean,
if...
if
one
of
them
leaves
the
conspiracy,
i
suppose
you
have
a
different
conspiracy
then,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
one
of
them
knows
that
it's
no
longer
possible
and
he
leaves
the
conspiracy.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
conspiracy
of
one,
so
to
speak,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if...
for
a
conspiracy
conviction,
i
mean,
because
the
whole...
the
whole
purpose
is
to
prevent
people
banding
together
for
wicked
purposes,
but
if...
if
there's
no
conspiracy
involved
and
he's
mistaken
in
the
fact,
i
assume
there's
no
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay...
or
dismiss
it.
they...
they
just
leave
it
up
to
the
judge?
it's
a
crime
or
not
depending
upon...
is
there
any
other
instance
where
the
model
penal
code
does
this
sort
of
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
the
ninth
circuit
rely
on
in
united
states
versus
cruz?
if...
if
the
law
is
as
uniform
as
you
say
it
is,
what...
what
did
they
rely
on?
they
must
have
relied
on
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
impossibility
caused
by
the
government
be
any
different
from
impossibility
caused
by
somebody
else?
you...
you
want
to
reframe...
you...
you
think
that
we
could
answer
this
question
no,
but
still
find
for
your
clients
because
this
is
not
just
impossibility
simpliciter,
this
is
impossibility
produced
by
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
wasn't
impossibility
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
was
it
terminated?
it
was
terminated...
people
didn't
write
notes
to
each
other
saying,
you
know,
let's
call
off
the
conspiracy.
it
was
terminated,
the
ninth
circuit
found,
because
its
object
was
no
longer
possible.
i
thought
that's
why
they
found
it
had
terminated.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
there...
there
is
a
public
danger
presented
by
people
who
band
together
to
rob
a
bank
even
when
there
is
no
money
in
the
bank.
it's
utterly
impossible.
right?
that...
that's
quite
different
from
the...
the
unquestionable
fact
that
there's
no
public
danger
presented
by
people
who
band
together
to
curse
somebody
with...
with
a
voodoo
doll.
you
can
say,
well,
you
know,
that's
a
harmless
conspiracy,
but
a
conspiracy
to
rob
a
bank
is
not
harmless.
these
are
bad
people,
and
if
they
don't
do
this
bank,
they
may
do
another
bank.
now,
you
acknowledge
that
that
is
a
conspiracy
even
though
there...
a
criminal
conspiracy
even
though
there's
no
money
in
the
bank.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
it
does...
it
is
not
a
criminal
conspiracy
if
the
reason
there
is
no
money
in...
in
the
bank
is
that
the
government
has
removed
the
money
from
the
bank
knowing
that
there's
going
to
be
a...
a
break-in?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
the
government
took
the
money
out
of
the
bank,
that
would
be
different
than
if
there
was
just
no
money
there
from
the
outset.
justice
antonin
scalia
they...
well,
in
both
cases
they
thought
there
was
money
in
the
bank.
in
one
case,
they
were
wrong
because
there
was
never
money
in
the
bank.
it
was
a
blood
bank.
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
second
case,
there
was
no
money
in
the
bank
because
the
government,
anticipating
a...
a
robbery,
had
removed
it.
and
you
say
that
there's
something
different
about
the
second
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i
don't
think
so
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
said?
that...
this
argument
you're
making...
is
that
the
basis
on
which
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
this...
this
conviction
couldn't
stand?
i
thought
it
was
just
simply,
you
know,
whether
they
were
enticed
in
or
not.
the
mere
fact
that...
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
execute
the...
the
conspiracy
was
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that...
and
that
would
follow...
that
would
also
be
true
if
the
project
was
impossible
from
the
outset.
right?
that...
i
mean,
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
you...
you
say
if...
if
they
enter
in
a...
into
a
conspiracy
to
rob
a
bank
in
which
there
is
no
money,
that
can
be
prosecuted.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know
it
has
been,
you
say.
but
it
can...
but
it
can
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
doesn't
that
violate
your
principle?
you
say
there's
no
harm
done
there
either.
there
is
just
as...
just
as
much
no
concrete
harm
that
could
have
been
done
there
except
the
harm
of
wicked
people
banding
together,
which
is
what...
what
the
crime
of
conspiracy
is
directed
against.
why
should
it
make
any
different...
difference
whether
the
impossibility
exists
from
the
outset,
or
whether...
whether
it...
it
occurs
later
in
the
scheme.
what...
why
does
that
make
any
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
assuming
cruz
is
right.
