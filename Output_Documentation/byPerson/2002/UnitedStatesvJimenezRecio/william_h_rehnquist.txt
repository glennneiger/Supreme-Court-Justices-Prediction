what
does

or
in

we'll

from

well,
mr.

the
only
question
presented

a
conspiracy
ends
as
a
matter
of
law
when
the

frustrates
its
objective.

say

h.
rehnquist

but
the
government
formulated
the
question
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
not--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that's...
that's
not
part
of
the
question
before
this
court.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
a
conspiracy
ends
as
a
matter
of
law
when
the
government
frustrates
its
objective.
and
whether
there
might
be
some
other
grounds
that
the
ninth
circuit
might
have
decided
it
on,
that
is
not
before
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
