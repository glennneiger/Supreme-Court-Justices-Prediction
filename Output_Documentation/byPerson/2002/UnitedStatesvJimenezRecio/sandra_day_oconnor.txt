and
taken
some
act
in

it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when
does
the
conspiracy
terminate,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.--
--but
explain
again
what
you
mean
now?
if,
instead
of
cocaine,
it
had
been
powdered
sugar,
can
there
be
a
conspiracy
conviction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
they
think
they're...
they
have
a
load
of
cocaine
and
that
was
their
intent,
but
unbeknownst
to
them,
it's
powdered
sugar.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
case
would
you
cite
to
us
for
this
notion
under
attempt
law?
is...
is
there
anything
from
this
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
it...
it
looks
like
the
instruction
to
the
jury
said
that
a
defendant
may
only
be
found
guilty
of
the
conspiracy
charged
in
the
indictment
if
he
joined
the
conspiracy
at
a
time
when
it
was
possible
to
achieve
the
objective
of
that
conspiracy.
was
that
the
instruction
given
them?
