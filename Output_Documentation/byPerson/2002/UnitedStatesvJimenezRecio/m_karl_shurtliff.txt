mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
counsel:
mr.
sullivan
and
i
expect
that
we
were
not
invited
here
to
argue
our
view
that
the
case
below
was
decided
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
question.
however,
having
said
that,
we
would
not
wish
to
have
it
taken
that
we
abandon
that
argument.
mr.
chief
justice,
a
number
of
the
questions
posed
seemed
to
go
to
the
heart
of
what
this
case
is
about.
justice
stevens
asked,
what
was
the
conspiracy
that
survived?
the
government
argues
at
length
in
the
brief
and
here
today
that...
notwithstanding
the
charge
in
the
indictment
and
the
trial
of
this
case
below...
that
by
november
18th,
1997,
mr.
recio
and
mr.
lopez-mesa
could
be
charged
with
the
crime.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
is
that
the
indictment
framed
what
this
case
was
about
by
november
18th.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
that's
the
argument
that
the
government
makes
that
we
should
not
sustain
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
this
case
as
framed
by
judge
browning
who
formulated
the
decision.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
i...
i
understand
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
and...
and
we
do
speak
to
that.
the...
the
question
was
posed,
what
conspiracy
survives,
and
i'm
suggesting
that
no
conspiracy
survived,
and
that
the
answer
is,
is
that
the
government
framed
the
case
as
they
would
have
it
and
that
the
issues
that
the
government
talks
about
here
today
and
in
their
brief
at
length
as
to
when
the...
these
two
late-comers
to
the
conspiracy
enter...
came
into
it...
obscures
that
notion.
your
honor...
or
mr.
chief
justice,
the...
the
question
posited
in
the...
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
has
been
really
argued
here
much
today
by
the
government.
the...
the
question
is
correctly
whether
a
conspiracy
ends
as
a
matter
of
law
when
the
government
frustrates
its
objective.
that
is
taken
from
the
formulation
of
former
chief
judge
browning
in
this
case
below
that
he...
all
they
said
was...
in
describing
the
case
here
and
referring
back
to
cruz...
in
cruz
we
ruled
that
a
defendant
could
not
be
charged
with
conspiracy
to
distribute
illegal
drugs
when
the
defendant
was
brought
into
the
drug
scheme
only
after
the
law
enforcement
authorities
had
already
intervened
and
defendant's
involvement
was
prompted
by
that
intervention.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
say
that
this
was
an
impossibility
case,
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
conspiracy
to
continue
as
to
other
people.
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
that
case
was
in
these
circumstances...
in
these
limited
circumstances,
in
cruz
and
in
recio...
that
given
the
government
intervention
in
the
objective
of
the
conspiracy,
given
the
government
intervention
and
the
invitation
after
that
to
join
the
conspiracy
by
recio
and
lopez,
that
they
couldn't
join
the
conspiracy.
it
was
a
new--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--i
think,
mr.
justice
scalia,
that
you
could
answer
the
question
no
and
still
find
for
our
clients
because
this
is
not
the
case.
this
is
not
why
they
were...
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
their
convictions.
the--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--there
wasn't
impossibility.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
it
was
termination.
they
added...
typically
and
historically--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--the
object,
mr.
justice
scalia,
was...
was
frustrated
by
the
government
intervention.
the--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--indeed,
justice
ginsburg,
there
was
sharp
disagreement.
justice...
judge
o'scannlain
and
eight
other
members
of
the
court
dissented
from
the...
not
granting
the
rehearing
en
banc.
however,
what...
the
point
i
seek
to
make,
not
very
well,
apparently...
is...
is
that
what
the
court
below
did
not
say
was
that
it
was
impossible
to
have
a
conspiracy,
but
that
they
added
to
abandonment
and
accomplishment
a
new
ability
to
frustrate
or
end
the
conspiracy.
that
is
government...
and...
and
narrowly.
government
intervention
that
frustrates
its
objective
and
that
government
intervention
invited
the
new
participants
into
it.
and
justice
ginsburg,
you...
you
inquired
as
to
what...
or,
justice
o'connor,
as
to
the...
as
to
the...
what
the
model
penal
code
might
say
about
that.
and
i
would
suggest
that
in
that
regard,
wharton,
in
describing
that,
said...
suggests
that
the
model
penal
court...
code
suggests
the
position
that
if
the
conduct
is,
quote,
"so
inherently
unlikely
to
result
or
culminate
in
the
commission
of
a
crime
that
no
public
danger
is
presented
warranting
defendant's
punishment
as
a
conspirator.
"
and
i
think
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
saying
in
this
case,
that
if
we
look
at
this
historical
purposes
of
conspiracy...
and
the
government
has
well
traversed
that
in
its
briefs
and
its
reply
brief...
that
the
gist,
the
gravamen
of
a
conspiracy
is
the
combination
that...
to
agree
to
do
something.
mr.
justice
kennedy,
you
inquired
whether
to
do
something
that's
not
illegal
is...
can
be
a
conspiracy,
and
i
suggest
that
that...
that's
part
of
what
brings
us
here
is
the
confusion
as
to
when
you
can
and
cannot
and
ought
not
have
a
conspiracy.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
indeed,
justice
scalia.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
there
would
be
no
conspiracy
if
the
government
had
intervened
in
that
conspiracy
early
on
and
the
involvement
of
the
participants
charged
was
only
as
a
result
of
that
involvement.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
i'd
think
not,
mr.
justice
scalia.
i
think
the...
the
question
would
be
what
the...
what
the
participants
who
were
engaged
to
participate
in...
in
the
robbing
of
the
bank
thought.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
and--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--i...
i
don't
think
there's
anything
different,
justice
scalia--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--mr.
justice
breyer,
they
can
be,
and
they
ought
to
be
depending
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
that's
why
the--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--i
think...
i
think
they're
guilt...
they...
i
think
they...
they're
in
on
the
conspiracy.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
they're
guilty
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
whether
they're
guilty
or
not
is
another
question.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
because
the
facts
before
us
are
that
these
two
individuals
joined
at
the
behest
of
the
government,
and
that
they
were
charged
and
tried
for
activity
before
the
date
of
november
18th,
1997.
they
were...
the...
the
government's
focus
on
this
case
was
narrow.
they
weren't
charged.
and
one
of
the
questions--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--intervened.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
frustrated.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
they
frustrated
the
objective
of
the
conspiracy--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--and
then
they
encouraged
the
participation
by
their
intervention
of
the--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--indeed.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
it's...
it's
similar
to,
but
different--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--and
you
have--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--and
you
have
this
case,
mr.
justice
breyer.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
well,
i...
i'm
not--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--mr.
justice...
or
justice
scalia,
i...
i
don't
think
that
they
got
to
the
notion
of
entrapment
or
enticement,
and...
and
that's...
i
think
that...
and
so
i
can't
say
that...
that
that's
part
of
the
predicate
for
how
they
got
where
they
got...
went
in
this
case.
i
think
they
focused
on
the
government
intervention
and
the
government
involvement
without
calling
it
the
typical
terms
of
entrapment--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--i--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--mr.
justice
kennedy,
i
think...
i
think
the
question
was
similarly
asked
to...
to
the
government,
and
i...
i
would
probably
agree
with
their
answer.
i
think
they
relied
on
castro,
a
predecessor
case
from
the
ninth
circuit,
and
then
they
relied
on
another
case.
i
think
what
happened...
i
don't
know...
was
is
that...
like
many
of
us,
the
more
you
study
the
area
of
conspiracy,
i
think
the
more
confused
you
get.
and
i
think
that's
what
justice
jackson
was
talking
about,
and
i
would
urge
that
we
consider
what
he
said
because
i
think
they...
they
blended
in
and
it's
different...
it's
hard
to
dichotomize
between
impossibility
and
termination
and
multiple--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--but,
mr.
justice
kennedy,
the...
the...
in
cruz,
he
was
invited
to
join
the
conspiracy
after...
only
after...
the
government
was
sitting
there
with
the
drugs
and
he
was
a
late
recruit
to
the
process.
he
wasn't
an
early
conspirator.
in
this
case,
these
persons
were
invited
to
join
only
after
the
government
had
fully
intervened.
they
could
have
stopped
it
then.
the
only
activity
was
to
get
new
recruits.
and
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
both
cases...
they
didn't
say
they
couldn't
be
charged
with
a
new
conspiracy.
they
could
have
been
charged
with
it.
indeed,
they
left
that
open
in
both
cruz
and
here.
they
could
have
been
charged
in
a
new
conspiracy
for
the
activities
that
they
engaged
in.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
i
think
they
could
have
been
charged
with
a
second
conspiracy
starting
on
the
19th.
they
weren't
charged.
i...
i--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--it
should--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--justice
ginsburg,
the...
the
question
of
variance
is
another
one
of
those
little
things
that
pop
up
and
confuse
some
of
us.
but
the
issue
in
this
case,
there
was
no
variance
because
the
government
said,
we
indict
you
for
activity
by
november
18th,
1997.
the
prosecutor
stood
before
the
jury
in
his
opening
and
his
closing.
the
instructions
all
went
to
the
issue,
we
will
show
that
these
persons
were
engaged
in
this
activity
for
either
a
single
load...
the
load
at
issue...
or
that
they
were
members
of
a
larger
conspiracy
before
november
18th,
1997.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
that's
not
variance.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
and
as
to
that
issue,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
we
said
it
in
our
briefs
and
i
said
it
in
my
brief
specifically,
i
believe,
that
the
policy
that's
come
down
through
the...
through
the...
conspiracy
is
not
that
old...
that
there
is
no
good
reason
why
the
answer
to
that
question
ought
not
be
yes,
that
a...
that
a...
it
is
terminated
as
absolutely
as
if
the
conspiracy
were
abandoned
or
if
it
were
accomplished
because
there
is
no
good...
there
is
no
chance
of
it
being
successful.
there's
no
chance
of
the
unified
activity
creating
the
dangers
that
we
speak
of
and...
when
we're...
when
we're
trying
to
combat
conspiracy.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
it
has
been,
mr.--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--surely.
surely.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
i
think
it
probably
should
not
make
much
difference--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--in
a
lot
of
cases,
but
i
think
each
case
is
fact-specific,
mr.
justice
scalia.
and
i
think
in
this
case
you
have
to
look
at
what
was
charged,
what
was
tried,
and
what
the
conspiracy
was
about.
and--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--i'm
not
real...
i'm
not...
i'm
not
really
sure,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
the...
the...
we
didn't
do
an
excerpt
for
the
record.
i
think
it's
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
some
of
them
are
referred
to.
i
don't
know
that
we've
listed...
i
don't
think
all
of
the
instructions
are
in
the
record
here.
the...
the
instruction
as
to
the
conspiracy.
and
that's
how
it
was
charged
that
it...
that
they
had
to
belong
before
or
after...
before
and
not
after.
the--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--thank...
thank
you.
the
issues
here
raise
difficult
questions.
the
whole
area
of
conspiracy
raises
difficult
questions
of
interpretation
and...
and
law.
i
suggest,
and
we
suggest
that
the
decision
below
is
not
as
far-reaching
as
it
might
otherwise
appear,
that
justice
browning
formulated
a
result
in
this
case
that's
much
narrower
than
what
we're
about.
but
on
the
other
hand,
having
said
that,
and
being
here,
the
question
is
whether
the
government
intervention
in
these
circumstances,
in
these
extant
circumstances,
ought
end
the
opportunity
and
the
ability
to
join
a
conspiracy.
we
simply
urge
that
frustration
of
the
purpose
of
the...
by
the
government...
invitation
to
join
by
the
government
in
these
circumstances
is
no
less
or
is
no
more
in
keeping
with
the
termination
of
the
conspiracy
than
would
be
had
they...
some
of
the
people
abandoned
the
conspiracy
or
had
it
been
accomplished.
the
government
argues
that
the
answer
to
this
question,
if
we
answered
it
in
the
affirmative,
would
raise
havoc
with
our
ability
to
prosecute
these
kinds
of
cases.
we
would
suggest
that
that's
not
the
instance
here.
here
in...
here
and
in
cruz,
as
near
as
we
can
tell,
cruz
has
been
cited
once;
this
case
not
at
all.
it's
not
a
set
of
circumstances
that
are
likely
to
reoccur
often
or
with
great--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--yes.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
but
that's
not
what
happened
here.
the...
the...
they
were
intercepted--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--and...
and
i...
i
retreat
again
to
the...
what
they
were
charged
with
and
what
the
indictment
was
and
what
they...
that
we
will
prove
that
they
were
involved
by
november
18th,
1997.
we
will
prove
that.
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
that's
what
they
kept
saying
and
they
argued
that
throughout.
now,
here
they
want
to
suggest
that...
that
by
going
to
the
19th,
it
provokes
no
prejudice
on
the
part
of
the
defendants.
that's
not
the
case
they
were
charged
with.
that's
not
the
case
that
was
tried
below.
and
so,
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
yes,
but
there
was
no
involvement
and...
and
depending
on
how
they
were
charged.
and
i--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--it
was,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
indeed.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
no.
the
government
supported
that,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
and...
and
that,
mr.
justice
kennedy,
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
said,
that
it
doesn't
support
either
the
single
load--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--i
think,
mr.
justice
kennedy,
you
send
it
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
for
a
determination
whether,
but
for
a
decision
that
cruz
is
incorrectly
applied
in
the
facts
in
this
case,
would
the
decision
below
remain
the
same.
and
i
suggest,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
government's
position
in
this
case,
that
the...
that
it
could
be
concluded
that
notwithstanding
the
application
of
cruz
in
the
ninth
circuit
below,
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
could
by...
almost
by
redacting
it,
eliminating
the
references
to
cruz...
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
the
evidence
was
just
simply
insufficient
to
sustain
the
conviction
for
either
the
single
load
or
the
multi-load
before
november
18th.
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
i...
i
think
that's
entirely
correct,
justice
stevens.
the...
the
jury
wasn't
asked
to
find
that,
and
the...
and
the
government
was
very
careful
in
the
way
they
tried
this
case.
we
will
show
you
that
by,
and
the
whole
case

by.
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
issue
was
whether

if
cruz
is
wrong,
the
question

still
be
whether
these
persons
entered

mr.

mr.
justice...

justice
souter,
we...
we
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
with...
with
other
reasons
because
the
court--
mr.
m.
karl
shurtliff
--in
the
instructions
that
we've
read
did
apply
cruz,
and
everybody
was
satisfied--
mr.
m.

--the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
ineffective...
there
were
several
issues
raised
and...
and
decided.
the
government
suggests
that
if
we
allow
this
decision
to
stand,
that
it
would
cause
irreparable
injury
and
damage
to
the
ability
of
the
government
to
prosecute
crime,
to
catch
people
who
are
miscreants,
and
that
it
would
make
inordinately
difficult
the
choices
of
the
prosecutor
in
determining
what
and
how
to
charge.
we
would
suggest
simply
that
that's
the
obligation
of
the
prosecutors
now.
cruz
doesn't
add
any
burdens
to
the
prosecutorial
responsibility.
thank
you.
