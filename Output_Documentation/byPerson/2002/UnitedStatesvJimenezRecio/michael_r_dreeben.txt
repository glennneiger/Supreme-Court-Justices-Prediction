mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
made
clear
that
conspiracy
is
an
inchoate
offense,
the
essence
of
which
is
the
agreement
to
commit
an
unlawful
act.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
it
means
an
uncompleted
offense,
activities
that
have
not
yet
progressed
to
the
point
of
having
violated
a
substantive
provision
of
the
criminal
law,
yet
which
represent
a
sufficient
step
to
warrant
legal
intervention
under
the
doctrine
of
either
attempt
or
conspiracy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
scalia,
except
that
word
seems
not
to
have
appeared
in
this
court's
opinions.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
in
the
case
of
a
conspiracy,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it...
it
may...
it
means
that
with--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--with...
right.
with
reference
to
the
object
offense.
so
a
conspiracy
is
an
agreement
to
commit
an
offense.
the
offense
has
not
yet
been
formed.
it
has
not
actually
been
realized,
but
the
conspirators
have
agreed
to
commit
the
offense.
and
the
law
of
conspiracy
deems
it
appropriate
for
society
to
intervene
at
the
stage
at
which
the
conspirators
have
entered
into
that
agreement
so
as
to
protect
society
against
two
things.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
o'connor,
under
the
drug
statute,
this
court
held
in
united
states
v.
shabani
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
proof
of
an
overt
act
in
order
to
punish
a
drug
conspiracy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
conspiracy
terminates,
justice
o'connor,
either
when
the
conspirators
achieve
the
objective
that
they
have
agreed
to
carry
out,
or
when
they
have
abandoned
efforts
to
do
so.
that
fundamentally
reflects
the
principle
that
the
essence--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
not
automatically,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
individual
will...
in
order
to
accomplish
a
withdrawal
from
the
conspiracy
has
to
do
more
than
simply
leave
it.
the
law
of
withdrawal
of
a...
on
withdrawal
from
a
conspiracy
requires
that
the
conspirator
do
some
affirmative
act
to
terminate
the
existence
of
the
conspiracy
either
by
going
to
law
enforcement,
or
by
communicating
to
his
fellow
conspirators
that
he's
done
with
the
venture
and
he's
out
of
it.
but
the
termination
of
the
participation
of
one
co-conspirator
through
withdrawal
or
abandonment
or
telling
law
enforcement
does
not
terminate
the
conspiracy.
the
very
nature
of
conspiracy
is
a
group
of
individuals
who
have
come
together
to
carry
out
an
unlawful
act,
and
in
order
for
the
conspiracy
to
do
that,
it
frequently
will
grow
and
enlarge
its
membership.
other
members
may
drop
out.
but
so
long
as
there
is
a
common
agreement
to
commit
a
definable
crime
or
unlawful
act,
the
conspiracy
continues.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
this
court
has
never
addressed
the
question,
and
i
could
find
no
cases
in
the
common
law
that
had
addressed
the
question.
certainly
under
the
common
law,
you
cannot
have
a
unilateral
conspiracy,
although
the
model
penal
code
would
have
allowed
that.
there
may,
however,
be
policy
reasons
to
hold
that
once
a
conspirator
has
embarked
upon
his
venture,
even
if
all
of
the
other
conspirators
are
arrested
and
give
up
the
effort,
that
one
lone
conspirator
who
still
soldiers
on,
without
knowing
that
the
other
conspirators
have
abandoned
it,
might
properly
be
held
liable
for
seeking
to
accomplish
the
aims
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
such
an
animal
exists,
it
would
be
a
conspiracy
in
which
all
members
but
one
have
abandoned
the
objective.
in
a
case
like
this,
however,
where
what
happens
is
that
two
members
of
a
multi-member
conspiracy
are
arrested,
one
of
them
becomes
a
government
agent,
the
other
one
perhaps
does
not...
and
it's
not
clear
that
he
did
abandon
the
efforts
to
accomplish
the
goals
of
the
conspiracy...
but
there
are
many
others
at
large
who
are
continuing
to
carry
out
the
conspiracy,
the
criminal
agreement
persists.
and
where
the
ninth
circuit
got
off
on
the
wrong
foot
was
by
believing
that
a
conspiracy
ends
when
its
goals
have
been
defeated.
when
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
has
been
defeated,
the
ninth
circuit
thought,
the
conspiracy
is
over.
that,
however,
is
contradictory
to
the
fundamental
principle
of
conspiracy
law
that
the
essence
of
the
crime
is
the
agreement
between
the
parties
to
carry
out
an
unlawful
act,
and
to
take
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--conspiracy
to
distribute
and
deliver
marijuana
and
cocaine.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
the
conspiracy
that
survived
was
the
conspiracy
to
distribute
that
cocaine
and
marijuana
that
had
been
seized.
but
what's
crucial
is
that
those
conspirators
who
remained
liable
were
entirely
unaware
that
the
government
had
intervened
and
frustrated
the
objective
of
the
conspiracy.
and
i
think
that
the
hypothetical
that
makes
clear
why
the
ninth
circuit
went
wrong
is
the
instance
where
the
government
enters
the
market
in
a
reverse
sting
operation
and
goes
into
the
market
as
a
seller,
offering
to
sell
drugs,
and
a
collective
of
individuals
decides
to
pool
their
resources
and
arrange
to
purchase
the
drugs
that
the
government
is
offering.
it
is
highly
likely
that
the
government
has
no
intention
and
never
had
any
intention
of
delivering
actual
drugs.
therefore,
the
goal
of
the
conspirators
is
frustrated
at
the
inception.
they
don't
know
it,
but
they
could
never
accomplish
the
object
of
their
conspiracy.
yet,
it's
settled
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
elsewhere
that
the
conspirators
can
still
be
held
liable
because
their
agreement
to
perform
an
act
which,
under
the
facts
as
they
understand
them,
would
be
unlawful.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
conspiracy
intervenes
at
an
earlier
stage,
justice
stevens.
the
traditional
federal
rule
is
that
in
an
attempt,
you
need
the
intent
to
perform
the
illegal
act,
plus
a
substantial
step
towards
its
completion.
the
law
of
attempt
has
always
required
a
little
bit
more
activity
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
before
the
government
can
intervene
and
penalize
it.
and
that's
in
part
because
of
the
need
to
have
some
corroborating
evidence
that
the
defendant
actually
did
intend
to
carry
out
an
illegal
act
and
to
avoid
penalizing
something
as
a
thought
crime.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
conspiracy
charge,
justice
ginsburg,
remained
the
same
in
both.
in
the...
the
indictment
was
not
changed.
it
was
a
single
indictment
that
alleged
the
conspirators
formed
an
agreement
at
a
date
unknown
to
the
grand
jury,
but
by
november
18th,
1997,
to
distribute
and
possess
with
intent
to
distribute
cocaine
and
marijuana.
in
the
original
trial,
the
parties
were
unaware
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
united
states
versus
cruz,
which
forms
the
basis
for
the
legal
rule
that
the
government
challenges
here.
and
it,
therefore,
proceeded
on
the...
what
we
believe
to
be
the
wholly
correct
theory
that
respondents
could
be
held
liable
for
joining
that
conspiracy
on
november
19th
when
they
agreed
to
become
couriers
to
move
the
drugs
further
down
the
road
in
idaho.
they
did
not
know
that
the
drugs
had
actually
been
seized
earlier
by
the
government
and
that
the
government
was
watching
them.
so
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
in
cruz
meant
that
what
the
government
had
argued
in
the
first
case
no
longer
was
sufficient
to
support
conspiracy
liability.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
doesn't
lapse
through
a
period
of
time,
justice
kennedy.
what
could
cause
the
conspiracy
to
end
is
the
conspirators'
wholly
abandoning
pursuit
of
the
objectives
of
the
conspiracy.
in
other
words,
if
all
of
the
conspirators
on
the
outside...
those
who
were
in
arizona
on
the
sending
end
and
those
who
were
on
idaho
on
the
delivery
end...
had
all
concluded
that
something
has
gone
wrong
with
this
shipment,
the
drugs
have
disappeared,
they
could
have
abandoned
the
narrowest
version
of
the
conspiracy--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
people
who
were
in
jail
were
the
couriers,
not
the
principals.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct,
because
so
long
as
those
individuals
who
are
involved
in
the
conspiracy
are
still
trying
to
accomplish
its
objective,
the
conspiracy
is
still
alive.
and
as
the...
as
in
the
case
of
the
government
sting
where
there's
never
any
drugs
in
the
outset,
the
conspiracy
is
impossible
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
the
conspirators
to
successfully
accomplish.
but
if
it
is
accepted
that
that
can
be
a
crime,
where
there's
a
government
sting
at
the
outset,
then
surely
the
government's
intervention
in
midstream
doesn't
automatically
terminate
the
conspiracy
as
a
matter
of
law,
which
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
held.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
o'connor,
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
powdered
sugar
is
supplied
by
the
government
under
the
representation
that
it
is
cocaine,
or
whether
the
defendants
are
actually
seeking
to
move
powdered
sugar
knowing
that
they
are
seeking
to
move
powdered
sugar.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
liability.
because
the...
the
question
of
conspiracy
liability
is
judged
by
what
the
actor
perceives
to
be
the
facts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
is
the
same,
justice
kennedy,
and...
and
the
uniform
position
in
the
federal
courts
is
that
it
is.
that
would
be
a
mistake
of
fact,
and
when
the
conspirators
or
the
person
who's
attempting
to
commit
a
crime
has
the
intent
to
commit
a
crime
and
takes
a
substantial
step
for
it,
the
fact
that
unbeknownst
to
him
some
aspect
of
the
universe
is
such
that
he
can't
complete
the
crime
does
not
defeat
the
accomplishment
of
the
objective.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
the...
the
modern
rule,
justice
scalia,
is
that
there
is
a
crime.
in
this
country,
the
earliest
case
that
addressed
it
and
the
case
that
all
of
us
are
familiar
with
from
law
school
is
people
versus
jaffe,
a
new
york
court
of
appeals
case
from
1906.
and
that
case
did,
indeed,
hold...
as
justice
kennedy
has
described
it...
that
if
the
person
is
receiving
what
he
believes
to
be
stolen
goods
and
the
goods
are
not
stolen,
he
is
not
liable.
but
the
modern
focus
on
attempt
law
is
on
the
intent
of
the
actor
to
commit
an
illegal
act,
and
the
fact
that
unbeknownst
to
him
there
are
circumstances
that
prevent
him
from
accomplishing
the
completed
crime
does
not
defeat
his
liability
for
an
attempt.
in
other
words,
attempt
law
and
conspiracy
law
have,
to
an
extent,
converged
on
the
policy
that
the
importance
of
inchoate
crimes
is
to
get
at
dangerous
actors.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there...
the
only
thing
that
there
is
from
this
court,
justice
o'connor,
are
two
opinions
that
have
addressed
the
obstruction
of
justice
statute,
osborn
versus
united
states
and
united
states
versus
aguilar.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
statute
that
didn't
use
the
word
attempt.
it
used
the
word
endeavor.
and
the
court
made
quite
clear
that
the
impossibility
of
the
defendant
accomplishing
the
objective
of
his
crime
doesn't
defeat
liability.
in
osborn,
it
was
an
individual
who
was
attempting
to
bribe
a
juror.
unbeknownst
to
him,
the
intermediary,
who
he
was
using
to
pay
the
bribe,
was
working
with
the
fbi.
and
of
course,
the
bribe
was
not
going
to
be
paid.
the
juror
was
not
going
to
be
corrupted.
and
yet,
the
court
held
that
an
endeavor
to
commit
the
crime
is
punishable.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
the
model
penal
code
goes
very
far
in
the
direction
of
the
intent-based
focus
of
attempt
law
and
conspiracy
law.
in
the
model
penal
code,
there
is
no
defense
for
impossibility
of
any
kind,
fact
or
law.
what
the
model
penal
code
does,
however,
is
allow,
in
certain
extreme
cases
that
it
wasn't
able
to
craft
a
principle
for,
a
power
to
a
judge
to
either
reduce
the
grade
of
a
crime
or
to
dismiss
it.
and
the
model
penal
code
was
thinking
about
hypotheticals
which
have
not
come
up
in
any
cases
that...
that
anyone
has
actually
found,
such
as
where
an
individual
believes
that
he
can
kill
through
incantations
and
voodoo
and
sets
about
to
do
so.
under
an
orthodox,
doctrinaire
approach
to
principles
of
attempt
law,
that
individual
has
the
intent
to
kill,
and
has
carried
out
a
substantial
step.
many
commentators
have
said
that
should
not
occasion
liability
because
it's
inherently
impossible
that
the
actor
will
achieve
his
goal
and
in
reality
that
person
is
probably
not
a
dangerous
individual
who
warrants
punishment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
only
a
matter
of
degree,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
for
that
reason,
the
model
penal
code
rejected
a
legal
rule
that
would
carve
out
inherent
impossibility
and
said
that
it's
really
something
that
should
go
to
whether
a
judge
should
reduce
the
grade
of
a
crime
or
dismiss
it.
our
position
is
that
that
sort
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
know
if
there
are
any
other
instances
where
the
model
penal
code
does
it,
but
our
position
is
that
the
sounder
approach
is
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--leave
those
cases
in
the
hands
of
prosecutorial
discretion
and
the
common
sense
of
juries.
the
fact
is
that
there
really
are
no
hypotheticals
in
real
cases
that
resemble
the
killer
by
incantation.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
ninth
circuit,
i
believe,
made
a...
a
linguistic
mistake.
there
are
an
abundance
of
cases
that
say
that
a
conspiracy
ends
when
its
goal
is
either
accomplished
or
defeated,
and
those
cases,
read
in
context,
mean
that
if
the
conspirators
actually
abandon
their
efforts
to
complete
the
crime,
or
all
of
them
are
arrested
and
they're
in
custody
and
they're
really
not
in
a
position
to
go
forward
anymore,
the
conspiracy
ends
at
that
point.
and
frequently
that
sort
of
a
determination
is
made
for
purposes
of
the
admission
of
co-conspirator
statements
under
801(d)(2)(e).
you
want
to
know
whether
the
conspiracy
is
alive
so
you
can
determine
whether
to
admit
post-arrest
statements
by
one
conspirator
against
another
conspirator.
and
in
those
cases,
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
say
that
the
conspiracy
ended
when
all
of
the
co-conspirators
are
arrested
and
have
given
up.
the
ninth
circuit
took
that
language...
the
language
referring
to
the
defeat
of
the
object
of
the
conspiracy...
and
took
it
literally,
and
the
effect
was
to
create
a
defense
of
factual
impossibility.
and
the
court
actually
used
those
words.
it
was
factually
impossible
for
the
conspirators
to
complete
their
crime.
therefore,
the
conspiracy
was
over
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
all
depends,
justice
breyer,
on
whether--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--on
whether
he's
still
attempting
to
achieve
the
goal
of
the
conspiracy.
there
are
a...
a
number--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
not...
not
necessarily,
justice
breyer.
in
this
case,
for
example,
one
of
the
two
arrested
couriers,
sotelo,
reportedly
told
arce,
the
other
arrested
co-conspirator,
that
they
should
both
tell
a
lie
to
the
authorities
and
then
try
to
escape.
i
mean,
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
so
long
as
the
statement
isn't
made
in
furtherance--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
what
it
may
show
is
that
the
statement
wasn't
made
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
if
he's
simply
talking
to
his
neighbor,
it
may
not
be
doing
anything
to
carry
out
the
aims
of
the
conspiracy.
if,
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--right.
the
statement
to
be
admitted
as
a
statement
of
a
co-conspirator
must
be
both
during
the
course
of
and
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
so
to
continue
your
hypothetical,
if
you
suppose
that
a
comes
out,
and
then
tries
to
communicate
through
intermediaries
that
he
knows
where
the
drugs
are
and
that
people
should
take
efforts
to
secrete
them
before
the
authorities
seize
them,
then
that
statement
could
be
admitted
as
a
co-conspirator's
declaration.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
actually,
i...
i
think
the...
the
way
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
the
involvement
of
the
two
couriers
begins
on
november
19th,
the
day
after
the
drugs
are
seized,
when
they're
recruited.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
that's
right.
when...
when
the
case
was
charged,
the
parties
weren't
focusing
on
cruz
and
the
case
was
just
charged
in
the
way
conspiracies
normally
are;
namely,
the
grand
jury
alleges
that
the
conspiracy
came
into
existence
by
a
particular
date
when
it
could
be
certain
that
it
did
come
into
existence.
it
may
have
come
into
existence
earlier,
and
the
grand
jury's
charge
says
from
a
date
uncertain,
but
at
least
by
november
18,
there
was
a
conspiracy
in
place
and
the
following
four
individuals
were...
are
to
be
charged
as
co-conspirators,
plus
others
unknown
to
the
grand
jury.
now,
in
light
of
the
way
the
facts
actually
panned
out
at...
at
the
trial,
and
given
the
holdings
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
government
failed
to
prove
pre-seizure
involvement
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
couriers,
the
indictment
might
have
more
accurately
been
written
to
say
that
on
november
18th,
at
least,
a
conspiracy
was
formed,
and
by
november
19th
the
respondents
joined
it.
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy,
because
the
crucial
aspect
of
a
conspiracy
and
a
defining,
limiting
principle
is
the
scope
of
the
nature
of
the
agreement.
courts
have
worked
out
a
multi-factor
test
to
determine
whether
you
have
one
agreement
or
two
agreements.
and
it
focuses
not
on
literal
identity
of
membership
or
complete
chronological
co-existence
of
the
participation
of
each
conspirator,
but
whether
there's
a
common
agreement
which
each
is
seeking
to
advance
forward
in
his
own
way
and
whether
the
excess
of
one
is
dependent
on
the
efforts
of
the
others.
now,
in
this
case,
construed
most
narrowly,
the
indictment
alleges
a
conspiracy
to
move
drugs,
staring
in
phoenix,
arizona,
through
las
vegas,
and
all
the
way
up
to
idaho
and
then
perhaps
beyond
that.
that
is
the
conspiracy
in
which
respondents
were
involved
as
substitute
couriers
brought
in
to
move
the
truck
from
the
karcher
mall
in
idaho
to
its
ultimate
destination.
that's
the
same
conspiracy
that
existed
at
the
outset.
the
original
couriers,
had
they
not
been
arrested,
would
have
completed
the
trip.
so
what
you
have
is
one
common
agreement
in
which
all
participants
are
working
to
achieve
the
same
goal,
and
there
is
only
a
switch
of
two
members,
the
two
couriers,
midstream--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
ginsburg,
if
you
read
the
indictment
as
alleging
that
they
were
involved
on
the
18th
and
we
didn't
show
that
they
were
involved
until
the
19th...
and
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
that's
what
we
showed...
you
have
a
variance
between
the
allegations
of
the
indictment
and
the
proof
at
trial.
and
the
settled
law
on
variances
is
that
it
is
no
defense
for
a
defendant
if
the
proof
varies
from
the
conspiracy
charged
in
the
indictment
so
long
as
the
conspiracy
that's
proved
up
is
within
the
scope
of
the
indictment,
a
lesser
included
conspiracy,
so
to
speak,
and
the
defendants
suffer
no
prejudice
from
the
variation.
now,
in
this
case,
everyone
knew
from
the
outset
that
the
centerpiece
of
the
government's
proof
against
respondents
was
going
to
be
the
observation
of
them
driving
up
after
the
call
was
placed
to
the
arizona
supplier
of
the
drugs
and
getting
into
the
truck
and
driving
the
truck
away
down
the
highway
in
idaho,
following
which
they
were
stopped
and
gave
completely
unbelievable
stories
about
what
they
were
doing
driving
around
with
a
truck
filled
with
drugs.
there
was
no
prejudice
to
the
defendants
in
defending
against
a
conspiracy
that
was
proved
up
based
on
the
events
of
the
18th
because
those
events
were
always
going
to
be
at
the
heart
of
the
government's
proof
that
they
were
liable.
so
absent
a
showing
of
prejudice,
the
variance
between
the
allegations
of
the
indictment
and
the
proof
at
trial
does
not
warrant
any
relief.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's...
the
essence
of
our
argument
is
that...
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
ruling
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
did
not
rely
on
principles
of
variance
or
principles
of
multiple
conspiracies
or
any
other
fact-based,
record-based
analysis
that
would
show
that
the
government
didn't
prove
the
conspiracy
alleged
in
the
indictment.
what
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on
was
its
holding
in
cruz
which
is
that
a
conspiracy
ends
when
the
government
intervenes
and
renders
its
completion
impossible.
and
the
ninth
circuit,
therefore,
reasoned
that
respondents
could
not
have
joined
the
conspiracy
alleged
in
the
indictment
because
that
conspiracy
was,
as
a
factual
matter,
over.
accordingly,
the
only
way
on
the
ninth
circuit's
view
that
the
government
could
win
this
case
is
if
the
government
showed
that
respondents
joined
the
conspiracy
before
the
seizure
of
the
drugs,
or
if
they
were
involved
in
a
broader
conspiracy
that
involved
other
drugs.
only
under
those
two
assumptions
did
the
ninth
circuit
think
that
the
government
could
prevail.
and
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient
to
prove
either
of
those
other
conspiratorial
activities.
it
never
questioned
that
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
to
prove
a
conspiracy
to
participate
in
the
distribution
of
drugs
on
november
19th,
when
respondents
showed
up
and
got
in
the
truck.
and
because
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
in
its
holding
that
a
conspiracy
terminates
when
it
becomes
factually
impossible
of
accomplishment,
the
rest
of
its
analysis
also
crumbles.
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
address
the
jury
instruction
issue
first,
the
jury
in
this
case
was
instructed
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
cruz,
and
therefore,
the
jury
was
asked
to
find
whether
there
was
evidence
of
respondents'
involvement
in
the
conspiracy
before
the
seizure
of
the
drugs
or,
alternatively,
whether
they
were
involved
in
a
broader
conspiracy,
not
limited
to
the
drugs
that
were
seized.
at
pages
6
through
8
of
our
reply
brief
at
the
petition
stage,
we
addressed
the
consequences
of
what
happens
if
this
court
should
conclude
that
the
cruz
legal
rule
is
incorrect.
and
in
essence,
our
position
is
that
any
rational
jury
that
found
guilt
under
the
cruz
instructions
also
would
have
found
that
respondents
were
involved
in
a
conspiracy
to
distribute
the
very
drugs
that
they
drove
to
the
karcher
mall
to
pick
up.
that
was
the
centerpiece
of
the
government's
evidence,
that
respondents
were
involved
in
a
conspiracy,
and
the
fact
that
the
jury
may
have
found
that
respondents
were
involved
in
a
longer
conspiracy,
or
in
other
conspiracies
wouldn't
detract
from
the
rationality
of
its
necessarily
concluding
that
the
respondents
were
also
involved
in
this
conspiracy.
even
if
this
court
didn't
agree
with
that
rationale
or
chose
not
to
reach
it,
it's
important
to
note
that
the
effect
of
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
is
to
find
insufficient
evidence
to
prove
the
crime
charged
in
the
indictment.
that
doesn't
leave
the
government
with
the
option
of
pursuing
a
new
trial
on
correct
instructions
with
the
cruz
findings
purged
from
them.
it
would
mean
that
respondents
have
permanent
immunity
from
the
crime
that's
charged
in
the
indictment.
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
cruz
is
wrong,
and
either
this
court
or
the
ninth
circuit
also
concluded
that
the
jury
instructions
somehow
prejudiced
the
defendants,
the
remedy
would
be
a
new
trial.
it
is
also
important,
i
believe,
to
note
that
the...
the
principle
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
adopted
would
go
contrary
to
what
this
court
has
noted
about
the
evolution
of
conspiracies.
in
a
case
called
blumenthal
versus
united
states,
which
we
did
not
cite
in
our
briefs,
but
it
appears
at
332
u.s.
539,
the
court
noted
that
conspiracies
involving
elaborate
arrangements
generally
are
not
born
full-grown.
rather,
they
mature
by
successive
stages
which
are
necessary
to
bring
in
the
essential
parties.
and
in
this
case,
two
essential
parties
were
brought
in
not
at
the
inception
of
the
conspiracy,
but
after
events
that
the
conspirators
were
aware
of
required
that
new
couriers
were
brought
in.
they
were
not
aware
that
the
government
had
seized
the
drugs,
but
they
knew
that
they
needed
new
couriers.
they
brought
them
in.
under
the
principles
of
blumenthal,
that's
all
one
conspiracy.
respondents'
counsel
has
mentioned
the
model
penal
code
provisions.
the
model
penal
code
at
section
5.01
addresses
the
question
of
impossibility
under
attempt
law
and
concludes
that
the
defense
should
not
be
recognized
and
at
section
5.03
does
the
same
for
conspiracy.
finally...
thank
you.
