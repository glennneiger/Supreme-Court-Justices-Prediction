justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
the
case...
four
conspirators,
a,
b,
c,
d.
a
is
arrested,
out
on
bail.
a
makes
a
few
statements
which
are
overheard.
can
you
admit
that
hearsay
against
b,
c,
d,
who
are
later
found?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
they
couldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say,
would...
in
that...
normally...
normally
a
person
who's
arrested,
that
ends
the
conspiracy
as
to
that
person,
doesn't
it,
at
least
normally?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
thinking
of
that.
i'm
thinking
it
is
an...
there...
there
is
no
reason
to
think...
all
we
know
about
him
is
he's
arrested
and
he
happens
to
mention
something
to
a
neighbor
that
has
nothing
to
do...
who
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
conspiracy.
this
statement
is
not
made
in
furtherance
of
any
conspiracy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
simply
made
after
a
is
arrested.
as
far
as
we
know,
a
has
nothing
further
to
do
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
that
shows...
in
other
words,
that
shows
what?
that
shows
that
although
the
conspiracy
in
your
view
continues...
b,
c,
d...
but
a
has
withdrawn?
is
that
what
it
shows?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
inadmissible,
in
other
words,
even
if
a
has
never
been
arrested?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what
is
your
reason?
i'm
just
trying
to
get...
a,
b,
c,
and
d
form
a
conspiracy
to
deprive
a
person
of
civil
rights,
to
rob
a
bank,
to
commit
an
act
of
terrorism,
whatever.
they
do
it
on
january
1.
on
march...
in
march,
a
government
agent
infiltrates.
now
it'll
fail.
in
april
three
more
people
join.
all
right?
now,
why
should
the
law
not
be
those
three
people
are
just
as
guilty
as
anybody
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
facts
of
the
case
are
just
what
i
said.
now
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
they're
guilty.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
guilty
and
they
joined
after--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no.
i'm...
all
the
facts
are
just
as
i
say.
so,
they're
guilty,
and
now
what
they
did
is,
after
all,
join
it
after
the
infiltration
of
the
government
agent
made
it
absolutely
certain
there
would
be
no
success.
all
right.
now,
how
is
that
different
than
the
facts
before
us?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now...
now
i
take...
you
say,
number
one,
you
take
my
hypothetical
and
say,
but
the
government...
what
did
the
government
do
that
was
different
from
the
hypothetical?
the
government--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--intervened.
yes,
i
got
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
joined
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true
in
my
hypothetical
too.
now
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
they
led.
i
see.
the
government
led
my
three
extra
people
to
join.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying
it's
like
an
entrapment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
it's
not
quite
as
strong
as
an
entrapment.
so
what
you're
argument
is,
is
that
where
the
government
has
joined,
thereby
frustrating
the
objective,
and
in
addition
brings
about
the
circumstances
through
which
the
later
membership,
a,
b...
of
my
three
extra
people
take
place,
that's
close
enough
to
entrapment,
plus
the
fact
that
the
conspiracy
can't
exceed...
can't
succeed.
put
those
two
things
together
and
you
have
grounds
for
not
convicting.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
the
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
all
right,
and
you
have
this
case.
but...
so
it's
like
a...
a
mix.
it's
like
an
impossibility/entrapment
mix.
that's
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
ridiculing
the
argument.
i'm
trying
to
understand
it.
it's
a...
it's
an
interesting
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
this
case
we
consider
the
legal
validity
of
a
rule,
a
ninth
circuit
rule
that
they
set
forth
in
a
circuit
case
called
united
states
versus
cruz.
cruz
said
that
a
criminal
conspiracy
ends
automatically
when
it
becomes
impossible
to
achieve
the
conspiracy’s
objective,
when
for
example
the
government
prostrates
a
drug
conspiracy’s
objective
by
seizing
the
drug
that
its
members
have
agreed
to
distribute.
the
facts
of
this
case
in
which
cruz
was
applied
illustrate
how
the
rule
work.
the
police
stopped
the
truck
in
nevada
and
they
found
a
large
stash
of
illegal
drugs
in
the
truck.
so,
with
the
help
of
the
truck
drivers,
they
set
up
a
sting.
the
driver
has
paged
the
contact.
the
contact
said
he
would
call
somebody
to
get
the
drugs.
a
few
hours
later,
the
defendants
in
this
case,
the
respondents
here
they
arrived
at
the
scene.
one
of
them
drove
away
in
the
truck,
the
other
followed
in
the
car.
now
eventually,
the
defendants
were
convicted
of
being
part
of
the
basic
conspiracy
to
possess
and
to
distribute
the
drug.
but
the
ninth
circuit
following
the
cruz
rules
set
aside
their
conviction.
the
circuit
said
that
once
the
government
had
seized
the
drugs
from
the
truck
in
nevada
it
became
impossible
to
achieve
the
drug
distribution
objective
of
the
conspiracy.
so,
the
conspiracy
ended,
and
that
they
said
was
before
the
defendants
arrived
on
the
scene,
so
the
government
could
not
convict
them
for
belonging
to
a
conspiracy
that
it
ended
before
they
joined
it.
now,
that
is
all
sorts
of
logical
but
in
our
view,
the
cruz
rule
incorrectly
states
basic
conspiracy
law.
a
conspiracy
does
not
terminate
simply
because
the
government
unbeknownst
to
some
of
the
conspiracy’s
member
has
made
it
unlikely
or
even
impossible
for
the
conspiracy
ultimately
to
succeed.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
essence
of
a
conspiracy
is
an
agreement
to
commit
a
non-lawful
act,
that
agreement
is
a
distinct
evil;
it
poses
a
threat
to
the
public
and
that
threat
is
not
just
the
substantive
crime
might
occur
but
also
that
the
conspirators
will
continue
to
commit
other
crimes
or
similar
crimes
on
other
occasion.
when
police
have
frustrated
the
conspiracy’s
object
but
the
conspirators
do
not
know
it,
those
conspiracy
related
dangers
remain.
so
to
does
the
essence
of
the
conspiracy,
namely
the
agreement
to
commit
the
crime.
legal
authority
outside
the
ninth
circuit
overwhelmingly
supports
this
view
of
the
law
that
the
government’s
frustration
of
the
conspiracy’s
objective
does
not
necessarily
prevent
prosecution
of
unknowing
conspirators,
and
in
our
view,
this
latter
view
correctly
sets
the
law.
so,
we
find
the
ninth
circuit’s
cruz
rule
erroneous.
we
reverse
the
judgment
here
in
so
far
as
it
relies
upon
that
rule,
and
we
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
