mr.
dreeben,
what
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
the
first
trial
in
this
case
described
a
narrower
conspiracy,
did
it
not,
than
was
involved
in
the
second
trial?
and
would
you
explain
what
the
difference
was
in
the
conspiracy
charge
initially
made,
and
the
conspiracy
charge
in
the
second
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
model...
model
penal
code
take
a
position
on
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
could
we
just
clarify
this
particular
case?
why
the...
the
date
of
the
18th
when
the
two
people
involved...
the
proof
as
to
them
goes
only
from
the
next
day
on?
and
why
the...
their
conspiracy
starts
the
day
that
the
drugs
are
seized.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
although
the
larger
conspiracy
that
they're
part
of
began
presumably
much
before
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
they're
charged
with
a
conspiracy
dating
from
the
18th.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
although
they
don't
enter
the
picture
until
the
19th.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
were
going
back
to...
i
think
you
hadn't
completed
your
answer
to
why
it's
okay
that
even
though
the
proof
as
to
these
two
defendants
starts
on
the
19th,
not
on
the
18th,
it's
okay
to
have
the
indictment
say
they
were
participants
from
the
18th.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
government's
position
is
there's
only
two
ways
a
conspiracy
can
end.
one
we
know
is
not
this
case.
they
didn't
succeed.
the
other,
the
government
says,
is
that
the
conspirators
have
to
abandon
it,
not
that
it
becomes...
there's
an
impediment
to
its
completion,
but
abandonment
by
one
person,
if
she
withdraws
from
the
conspiracy
and
tells
the
police,
for
example,
or
tells
the
co-conspirators.
but
an
impediment...
another
impediment...
doesn't
stop
the
conspiracy
from
persisting.
and
the
ninth
circuit
i
thought
pretty
clearly
said,
yes,
it
does,
and
that...
wasn't
there
rather
sharp
disagreement
among
the
ninth
circuit
judges
over
this?
they
didn't
treat
it
as
a
question
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben
said
that
was
a
variance
whether
it
was
the...
they
joined
on
the
18th
or
the
19th.
the
question
is
what
did
they
join,
and
why
should
it
make
a
difference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
these
defendants
didn't
know
there
had
been
any
seizure,
why
should
it...
why
should
their
guilt
turn
on
that
factor?
as
far
as
they're
concerned,
this
is
a
truck
that
has
gotten
by
the
government's
surveillance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
says
that
the
conspiracy
began
on
or
about
that
date,
but
then
it
says
the
defendants
became
member.
it
doesn't
say
the
date
the
defendants
became
member.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
in
this...
suppose
in
this
case
the
truck
had
been
apprehended
in
arizona,
and
neither
of
the
participants
at
that
point
cooperated
with
the
police
except
to
tell
the
police
that
their
instructions
were
to
drive
the
truck
to
a
certain
place.
then
without
any
government
intervention
in
calling
recio
and
his
buddy...
recio
and...
and
his
co-defendant
show
up
without
any
government
intervention.
so
we
have
the
government
seizure,
just
as
you
do
in
this
case,
but
the
scenario
plays
out
just
as
it
was
arranged
without
any
government
intervention.
in
that
case,
would
you
say
that
the...
that
the
conspiracy
continued
and
these
people
are
properly
prosecuted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you're
making
it
turn
on
the
government
having
a
part
in
bringing
in
the
latecomers.
