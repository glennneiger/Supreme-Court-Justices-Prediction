m.

well,
it
is
in
the
dictionary.
i'm
getting
it
in
a
minute.
it
will
take
me
a
minute
to
noodle
while
i
get
it
out
of
the
dictionary.
but
i...
i
thought
that
it
meant
something
that's
not
yet
formed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
that's
what
the
word
meant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
incipient
i
suppose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--would
you...
would
you
tell
me
what
the
conspiracy
was
that
survived
the...
the
claimed
end
of
the
conspiracy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
is
there
a
temporal
component
to
your
argument?
if
the
initial
defendants
had
been
arrested
and
detained
for
a
month
and
then
they
got
around
to
the
sting
operation,
would
it
still
be
a
conspiracy,
or
does
it
lapse
after
some
reasonable
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
so
long
as
one
of
the
end
delivery
people
didn't
know
about
it
and
thought
that
the
drugs
were
still
on
the
way,
he
could
continue
to
recruit
people
and
so
forth
even
if
the
principals
had
been
in
jail
for
a
month
and
the
drugs
had
been
seized
for
a
month?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's...
let's...
all
right.
but
even
those...
some
couriers
had...
had
been
in
jail.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
is
that
different
from
an
agreement
to
receive
stolen
goods
and
then
we
find
out
the...
goods
are
not
stolen?
that's...
that's
not
actionable
i...
i
had
thought.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
government
have
charged
a
separate,
second
conspiracy
if
it
had
chosen
to
do
so?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
relied
on
cruz,
and
in
cruz
it
said
it
extends...
the
court
said
it
extends
conspiracy
liability
beyond
reasonable
limits
to
say
that
it
continues
when
the
product
can
no
longer
be
delivered
and
all
that
remains
is
for
a
new
recruit
to
be
added.
but
there
is
no
reason
given
for
that
in...
in
cruz.
there
must
be
some
legal
doctrine
that
it
rests
upon.
impossibility
or
entrapment
are
the...
are
the
two
categories
that
we
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
something
else.
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
don't...
i
don't
know
what's
confusing
about
having
people
with
a
criminal
intent
who...
who
join
a
conspiracy
with
the
intent
to
violate
the
law
being
called
conspirators.
that's
not...
it
doesn't
sound
like
rocket
science
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
think
that
this
defendant...
these
defendants
could
have
been
charged
in
a
new
conspiracy?
it
seems
that...
that
undercuts
your
argument.
i
thought
the
whole
purpose
of
this
argument
was
to
have
some
reasonable
confines
on
how
long
a
conspiracy
can
exist
after
everybody
knows
it's
not
going
to
go
forward.
and
now
you
say
there
was
a
second
conspiracy
that
could
have
been
charged?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
should
happen
if
the
trial
judge
faithfully
followed
cruz?
and
under
cruz,
the
jury
should
not
have
found
him
liable,
but
we
say
that
cruz
is
wrong.
does
it
still
have
to
go
back
for
a
new
trial?
because
the...
on
page
76a
of
the
appendix,
the
instructions
seem
to
say
that...
one
of
two
things.
you
can
only
find
him
guilty
of
the
conspiracy
if
he
joined
it
prior
to
1:18
a.m.
on
november
18th.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
find
there's
a
larger
conspiracy,
you
can
find
him
guilty,
but
that
larger
conspiracy
must
be
to
distribute
other
drugs
than
those
that
were
seized.
so
i...
i
suppose
the
proof
doesn't
support
either
of
those
conspiracies.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
happens
if
we
think
this
instruction
was
wrong?
under
the
evidence,
the
defendants
should
have
been
convicted,
and
that
cruz
is
wrong.
do
we
still
have
to
send
it
back?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course--
--assuming
cruz
is
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
assuming
cruz
is
wrong,
and
then
it
would
seem
to
me
the
evidence
is
fully
sufficient
to
convict
if
cruz
is
wrong
because
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
they
joined
it
before
or
after
1:18
a.m.
on
the
18th.
