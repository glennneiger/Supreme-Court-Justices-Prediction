justice
john
paul
stevens
what...
what...
conspiracy
to
do
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
it
the
marijuana
and
cocaine
that
had
already
been
seized
by
the
government,
or
some
other
marijuana?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
difference
between
an
attempt
and
the
conspiracy,
in
the
attempt
you
need
a
dangerous
probability
of
success
or
something
along
that
line,
but
you
don't
need
that
in
a
conspiracy
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask?
are
the...
are
the
instructions
to
the
jury
in
the
papers
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
instructions
are
in
the
petition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
means
the
jury
must
have
found
that...
that
there
was
evidence
sufficient
to
say
they
joined
before
the
impossibility
occurred.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
government
object
to
that
instruction,
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
another
question?
is
there...
is
it
conceivable
that
the
jury
found
that
the
evidence
after
the
impossibility
was
sufficient
to
sustain
the
verdict?
because
they
weren't
asked
to
find
that.
i
mean,
i
don't...
as
i
understand
mr.
dreeben's
argument,
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
later
on,
that
they
joined
the...
they
joined
an
ongoing
conspiracy,
but
the
charge
didn't
ask
them
to
find
that,
as
i...
maybe
mr.
dreeben
will
comment
on
it
in
his
rebuttal.
