that's
the
district
court
judge?
justice

but
it
wasn't
a
final
judgment
in
the
sense
that
an
appeal
could
be
sought
from
that,
because
it
was
transferred.
the
district
court
judge
transferred
it.
he
didn't
dismiss
the
60(b)
motion,
which
i
would
have
thought
the
district
court
might
have
done,
and
then
it
perhaps
could
have
been
appealable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what...
what
does
the
statute,
the
aedpa
statute
contemplate?
that
somebody
in
this
defendant's
position
could
have
applied
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
permission
to
file
a
successive
petition?
could
that
have
been
done
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
not
done?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then,
to
get
an
appeal
on
that...
it
sounds
so
complicated,
because
the
law
has
gotten
so
complicated
with
aedpa,
but
maybe
he
should
have
sought
transfer
back
to
the
district
court
so
the
district
court
could
dismiss
it
and
give
something
from
which
an
appeal
could
be
taken.
