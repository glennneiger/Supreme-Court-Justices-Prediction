justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
sixth
circuit
did...
the
sixth
circuit
had
held
before
in
a
case
arising
out
of
kentucky
that
if
you
don't
go
to
the
top
court,
you
have
not
exhausted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
the
jurisdictional
issue
really
turn
on
whether
it
was
a
second
or
successive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
you
say
that,
but
the
relief
sought
in
the
60(b)
motion
was
not
relief
from
the
state
court
judgment.
it
was
relief
from
the
final
judgment
in
the
habeas
proceeding
because
of
the
tennessee
rule,
so
they
asked
to
reopen
the
habeas
proceeding,
not
to
file
a
second
habeas
proceeding,
and
they
asked
to
reopen
it,
and
just
to
have
a
claim
which
was
undecided
in
that
proceeding
decided,
which
had
never
been
decided,
so
there
was
not
asked
for
second
consideration
of
a
claim,
just
for
the
first
consideration.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
of
a
claim,
a
first
litigation
of
a
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
ask
in
the
60(b)
motion
for
relief
from
the
state
court
judgment
which
would
be
the
relief
requested
in
the
habeas
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
ask
for
relief
from
the
state
court
judgment
in
the
60(b)
motion,
or
just
from
the
habeas
court
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
it
was
a
60(b)
motion,
because
that's
what
60(b)
is
directed
at,
where
the
second
or
successive
petition
would
have
asked
for
relief
from
the
state
court
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
call
it
that,
but
supposing
instead
of
the...
the
tennessee
rule,
they
had
been
able
to
demonstrate
it...
very
improbable,
just
to
give
the
hypothesis
out...
that
a
waiver
of
the
claim
for
the
prosecutorial
misconduct
had
been
executed
and
the
waiver
was
false,
that
there
was
a
fraud
on
the
court
in...
in
having
that
issue
precluded
from
review.
would
a
60(b)
motion
have
been
permissible
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
granting
a
60(b)
motion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
wouldn't
that
be
the
office
of
a
60(b)
motion,
to
correct
that
very
fraud?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
that
situation
a
60(b)
motion
would
be
permissible
under
that
section?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
have
to
file
a
motion
and
have
those
facts
developed
in
order
to
do
it,
and
60(b)
is
the
avenue
for
doing
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
here,
the
relief
requested
is
precisely
the
same,
namely
that
one
claim
was
not
heard
which
was
in
the
case,
for
a
reason
that
was...
turned
out
to
be
a
gross
mistake
of
the
law.
they
thought
the
law
was
exhaustion
because
of
a
rule
of
law,
and
it
turns
out
they
were
wrong,
so
you
have...
instead
of
fraud,
you
have
a
mistake
of
law.
now,
maybe
that
doesn't...
doesn't
justify
60(b)
relief,
but
it
certainly
is
a
classic
case
of
what
60(b)
is
directed
to...
to
solve.
justice
john
paul
stevens
directed
at
the
final
judgment
in
the
habeas
proceeding
as
opposed
to
the
final
judgment
in
the
state
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
true
of
my
fraud
case,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
here
it
isn't
a
sham,
it
was
just
a
mistake.
they
misread
the
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
conceivable
that
a
district
judge
might
erroneously
in
some
case
call
something
second
or
successive
and
it
really
wasn't?
is
it
ever
possible
for
him
to
do...
make
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
he
does
make
a
mistake,
what's
the
remedy
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
instead...
i
gave
you
a
fraud
example...
instead
of
that
it
was
a
mistake.
the
judge
thought
that
the
petitioner
had
waived
the
case.
they
thought
there
was
a
document
in
the
file
waiving
this
issue
and
he
was
just
dead
wrong,
and
he
said,
then
the...
after
the
decision...
the
final
decision
in
the
habeas
case,
the
judge...
the
litigant
finds
out
that
the
judge
incorrectly
relied
on
a
mistaken
representation
of
fact.
could
he
not
file
a
60(b)
to
correct
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it...
it
undermines
it
in
the
sense
that
it
denied
the
litigant
a
hearing
on
a
claim
asserted
in
the
habeas
proceeding,
namely,
the
prosecutorial
misconduct.
he
just
never
got
a
hearing
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
exactly
what
it
was
here,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
failed
to
exhaust.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
ruling
was
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that
argument,
but
if...
but
i
don't
understand
your
position
if
it
was
based
on
a
mistake
of
fact,
rather
than
a
mistake
of
law.
here
was
just
a
clear
mistake
of
law.
the
parties
all
misunderstood
what
the
law,
as
later
explained
by
the
tennessee
court,
was.
it
was...
he
did
not...
he
had,
in
fact,
exhausted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
didn't
think
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
was
2
years
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
changed
the
understanding
of
the
district
judge
and
the
litigants.
they
thought
the
law
was
otherwise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
he
knew
what
the
tennessee
court
was
later
going
to
decide?
well,
actually,
the--
because
what
he
did
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
what
the
tennessee
court
decided.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
did
demonstrate,
did
it
not,
that
the
district
judge
was
wrong
in
his
ruling
on
exhaustion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
the
60(b)
motion
was
directed
at
the
state
court
judgment,
is
that
what
you're
telling
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
not
at
the
habeas...
not
asking
the
habeas
court
to
vacate
the
ruling
on
the...
on...
denying
habeas
and
setting
it
down
for
a
ruling
on
the...
on
the
prosecutorial
misconduct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he's
not
relitigating
a
claim
that's
been
adjudicated,
he's
relitigating...
he
wants
to
litigate
a
claim
that
had
not
been
adjudicated.
he
wanted
a
ruling
on
the
merits
of
his
claim,
which
he
never
got.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct,
but
they
didn't
get
a
ruling
on
the
merits
of
the
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
just
ruled
that
it
was
procedurally
defaulted
because
it
had
not
been
exhausted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
not
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
amounts
to
an
adjudication
on
the
merits,
but
in
fact,
the
merits
had
never
been
decided.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think...
i
think
you're
saying
that
if
there's
an
adjudication,
there's
no
room
for
a
60(b)
motion
predicated
on
a
mistake.
that's
your
submission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
that's
your
submission.
in
construing
rule
60(b),
it
simply
does
not
apply
if
there's
been
an
adjudication,
but
my
suggestion
to
you
is
that
the
only
time
60(b)
applies
is
when
you've
got
a
judgment
you
want
to
reopen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
agree
with
everything
you
say
if
you
are
correct
in
classifying
a
particular
judgment...
i
mean,
a
particular
claim
as
a
second
or
successive
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
some
cases,
i
think,
when
that
classification
does
not
fit
the
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
no.
01-9094,
abdur'rahman
against
bell.
the
case
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted,
but
i
have
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
from
the
courtâ€™s
dismissal.
