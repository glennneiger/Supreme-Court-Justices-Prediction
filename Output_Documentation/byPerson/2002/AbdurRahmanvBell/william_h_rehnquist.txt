chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
01-9094,
abu-ali
abdur'
rahman
versus
ricky
bell.
mr.
liebman.
i
think
the
court
would
like
to
hear
argument
on
the
questions
we
asked
for
supplemental
briefing
on,
as
well
as
your
original
petition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
couldn't
he
have
moved
to...
in
the
sixth
circuit...
to
remand
the
case
if
he
disagreed
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
means
that
the
district
court's
decision
was
not
final.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
page
1a
of
the
blue
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let's
go
back
to
(3)(a)
for
a
minute,
mr.
liebman.
it
says...
as
you
point
out...
before
a
second
or
successive
application
permitted
by
this
section
is
filed
in
the
district
court.
you
say
all
of
that
is
a
prerequisite,
i
take
it,
for
the
court
of
appeals
acting,
but
supposing
it's
a
second
or
successive
application
that
is
not
permitted
by
this
section.
that
wouldn't
deprive
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
jurisdiction
to
say
no,
would
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but...
so
then
the
first,
the...
the
first
clause
of
(3)(a)
is
not
really,
strictly
speaking,
entirely
jurisdictional.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's,
of
course,
part
of
the
issue
in
the
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
the
question
is
whether
you
can
ask
for
cert
for
any...
from
any...
part
of
it
in
view
of
the
provision
of
the
statute
that
it's
not...
i
just
don't...
i'm
not
sure
you
can
bifurcate
the
order
and
say,
we're
not
challenging
the
denial,
we're
challenging,
in
effect,
the
reason
for
the
denial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
liebman,
we've
decided
a
couple
of
cases,
one
about
30
years
ago,
harris
against
nelson,
and
then
another
case
called
pitchess,
in
maybe...
that
indicate
that
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
particularly
60(b),
do
not
apply
if
they
conflict
at
all
with
the
habeas
regulations.
now,
you
don't
cite
either...
either
of
those
cases
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
sorry.
i--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
didn't
see
them
in
the
index.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
didn't
cite
them
in
your
opening
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
the
second
circuit
was
the
only
case
that
really
supported
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
this
area
as
to
whether
a
60(b)
rule
can
be
used
as
a
substitute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how...
how
long
after
the
district
court
ruled
that
your
claims
were
not...
not
exhausted,
how
much
time
elapsed
between
then
and
the
time
you
filed
your
rule
60
motion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
3-1/2
years,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
answer
my
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
3-1/2
years?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
hasn't
the
sixth
circuit
had
an
opinion
on
that
subject
as
to
whether
the
rule
promulgated
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court
was
a
change,
or
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
doesn't
that
foreclose
you,
because
when
you're...
if
it's
not
second
and
successive
as
defined
by
aedpa,
that
means
those
are
the
only
kind
you
can
bring?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
that
you
can
pull
something
else
in
under
rule
60.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
you
suggesting
there
was
fraud
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
what's...
what's
the
authority
for
that
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
liebman.
i
take
it
you're
reserving
your
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
summers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
go
on
a
different
section
of
rule
60,
wouldn't
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
section
of
rule
60
that
specially
deals
with
fraud.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
summers.
mr.
zidlicky,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
zidlicky.
mr.
liebman,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
liebman.
the
case
is
submitted.
