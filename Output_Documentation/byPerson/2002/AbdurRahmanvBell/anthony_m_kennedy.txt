m.
kennedy
well,
the
law's
new.
i
mean,
that's
your
whole
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
all
right,
i'll--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
describe
for
me
what
portion
of
rule
60(b)
is
still
operative
with
reference
to
mistakes,
given
aedpa?
does
aedpa
completely
supersede
rule
60(b)
with
reference
to
the
category
of
mistakes
and,
if
not,
how
would
you
characterize
or
describe
for
us
what
remains
of
rule
60(b)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
to
anything
that's
been
adjudicated,
the
category
of
mistakes
is
removed
from
rule
60(b)
when
aedpa
is
in
the
picture?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
your
view,
60(b)
necessarily
has
a
much
more
narrow
application
in
aedpa
cases
than
in
other
cases,
or
in
habeas
cases
than
in
other
cases?
