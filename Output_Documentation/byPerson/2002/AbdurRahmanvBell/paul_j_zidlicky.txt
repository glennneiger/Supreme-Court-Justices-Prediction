mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
by
first
responding
to
justice
stevens'
question,
in
which
he
said
that
the
rule
60(b)
motion
didn't
seek
the
relief
of
granting
of
federal
habeas.
it
actually
did.
in
the
joint
appendix
in
170,
the
court...
the
petitioner
sought
relief
from
the
state
court
judgment
in
bullet
point...
i
believe
it's
five,
but
in
any
event,
i
think
underlying
that
is
the
question
of
whether
there
had
been
a
prior--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--yes.
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
for
both.
for
both,
justice
stevens.
he
asked
for
both
of
those,
and
i
think...
he
sought
to
reopen
the
judgment,
and
he
also
sought...
he
sought
in
bullet
point
5
to...
or,
relief
from
the
state
court
judgment,
and
that's
in
the
joint
appendix.
the
question--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--well,
i
was
just
responding
just
to
justice
stevens'
point
that
he
didn't
seek
that
relief
in
his
rule
60(b)
motion.
he
actually
did,
but
the...
but
the
underlying
question
is--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--what
he's
trying
to
do
is,
he's
trying
to
relitigate
a
claim
that
had
been
adjudicated
against
him
through
rule
60(b),
and
this
court
said
in
calderon
that
you
can't...
that
the
requirements
of
2244(b)
can't
be
evaded,
and
one
of
those
requirements
is,
you
can't
relitigate
a
claim
that
has
been
adjudicated.
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
no,
justice
stevens,
there
was
an
adjudication
of
his
claim.
there
was
an
adjudication
of
his
claim
by
the
district
court
which
said
his
claim
was
procedurally
defaulted--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--and
that
he
had
failed
to
establish
cause
and
prejudice,
and
that--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--no,
he--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--well,
that's...
but
i
don't
think
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
in
this
court's
cases
in
stewart
and
slack,
the
court
made
clear
that
in
determining
whether
there
had
been
a
prior...
the
language
that
the
court
had
used
was
whether
there
had
been
a
prior
adjudication
of
the
claim.
here,
there
was
a
prior
adjudication
of
the
claim.
this
court's
precedent,
going
back
to
wainwright
v.
sykes,
coleman
v.
thompson,
and--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
no,
it
is...
it's
an
adjudication
for
purposes
of...
it's...
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
he
can
come
back
and
file
to
relitigate
the
issue,
come
back
and--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--that's
not
the
test
that
this
court
has
adopted
in--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--i
don't...
you're
right,
justice
souter,
he
didn't
make
a
determination
regarding
the
underlying
merit
of
the
constitutional
claim,
but--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--i
think
it's
correct
as
a
descriptive
matter
to...
but
with
one
qualification.
what
you're
saying
is
that
there
is
an
exception
for...
i
think
in
substance
what
you're
saying
is,
you
can
continue
to
relitigate
claims
of
procedural
default
because
they're,
quote,
not
on
the
merits,
but
i
think
the
way--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--justice
souter,
and
perhaps
this...
this
is...
i
don't
think
this
is
an
exceptional
case
in
this
regard.
when
he
went
back--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--well,
the
argument
that
he's
making
is,
he's
entitled
to
relitigate
a
claim
that
has
been
adjudicated
against
the--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--well,
i
do
think
that
this
is...
this
case
is
fundamentally
different
than
the
case
in
stewart
and
slack.
in
those
cases,
what
the
court
had
determined
was,
it
wasn't
a
second
or
successive
habeas
petition.
you
weren't
seeking
to
relitigate,
and
the
reason
was
because
you'd
never
received
an
adjudication
of
the
case
at
all.
the
court
didn't
say
no
to
your
habeas
claim.
it
said,
not
yet.
in
slack,
the
court
said,
go...
go
exhaust.
in
stewart,
the
court
said,
the
case
is
not
ripe.
here
what
the
court...
here
what
the
court...
the
district
court
told
him
was,
they
didn't
say
not
yet,
the
court
said
no,
you're
going
to
lose,
and
you're
going
to
lose
based
on
precedent
from
this
court
starting
with
wainwright
v.
sykes.
really
what
they're
asking
is
for
an...
a
loophole
to
this...
to
the
requirement
for
second
and
successive
petitions
for
procedurally
defaulted
cases,
and
if
that's
the
loophole,
then
there's
no
way
to
distinguish
that
from
abuse
of...
abuse
of
the
writ
cases,
because
in
both
instances,
you
can
make
the
argument
that
there
wasn't
any
ruling
on
the
substantive
merits,
but
there
was
a
ruling,
and
the
one
that's
important
was,
he
received
an
adjudication,
and
if
he
disagreed
with
that
adjudication
he
should
have--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--i
think
what...
the
analysis
that
the
court
would
have
to
determine
is
whether
there
had
been
an
adjudication.
if
later
on
there's
a
claim,
after
the
court
has
decided
the
issue,
that
there
was
a
mistake
of
fact
or
a
mistake
of
law,
the
question
is,
are
you
trying
to
relitigate
the
issue,
and
if
that's
the
case
then
60(b)
wouldn't
apply.
but
if
you're
saying
that
there
was
never
adjudication
in
the
first
place
for
the
example
of
a
judge
who
had
been
bribed
in
the
first
federal
habeas
proceedings,
you
would
say,
well,
that's
not
a
second
or
successive
habeas
application--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--i
think
if
there's
been
an
adjudication,
and
i
think
that's
the
sense
that...
in
your
decision
in
slack...
that's
the
underlying
issue.
now,
it...
that
doesn't
mean
that
there's
no
relief.
you
can...
you
can
try
to
seek
to
file
a
second
or
successive
habeas
application,
but
this
court
in
davis
versus
pitchess
made
clear
that
rule
60(b)
is
not
a
way
of
circumventing
the
requirements
of
aedpa,
and
you
in
calderon
made
clear
that
what
aedpa
prohibits
is
the
relitigation
of
a
claim
that
had
been
adjudicated,
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
in
this
case.
there
had
been
an
adjudication.
he
claims
that
it
was
wrong.
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
that
is
my
submission.
i
don't
think
there
was
a
mistake
here.
i--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--well,
your
honor...
and
the
reason
that
60(b)...
you
know,
one
of
the
arguments
that
petitioner
makes
here
is,
they
say
that,
well,
these
claims
will
rarely
be
granted
so
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it,
but
the...
but
what
aedpa
requires
is,
it
says
these
claims
are...
the...
if
you're
trying
to
relitigate
a
second
or
successive
habeas
application,
what
it
does
is,
it
takes
that
away
from
the
district
court
completely,
the
delay
in
the
costs
that
are
associated
with
that
relitigation.
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
right.
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
but
i
think,
though,
a
determination
of
procedural
default
falls
in
the
heartland
of
habeas
jurisprudence,
and
it's
the
heartland
of
a
determination
that
you're
not
entitled
to
relief.
in
slack
and
in
stewart--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--yes,
justice...
justice
kennedy,
i
think
that's
right,
and
i
think
the
reason
why
is
because,
as
this
court
explained
in
davis
versus
pitchess,
you
can't
use
60(b)
to
circumvent
the
substantive
requirements
of--
mr.
paul
j.
zidlicky
--i
think...
i
think
what
congress
did
was,
it...
it
did
identify
the
criteria
that...
that
a
district
court
would
look
to
in
determining...
it
defined
that
criteria,
but
the
one...
the
one
place
that
you
could
look
to
is,
you
could
then
go
back
to
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
under
2241
for
those
exceptional
circumstances.
