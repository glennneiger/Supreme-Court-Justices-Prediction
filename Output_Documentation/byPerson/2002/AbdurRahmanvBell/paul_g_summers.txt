mr.
paul
g.
summers
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
of
this
case
and
the
writ
should
be
dismissed,
but
if
this
court
concludes
that
it
does
have
jurisdiction,
then
the
alleged
60(b)
motion
was
a
prohibited
second
or
successive
application
because
it
attempted
to
revisit
a
prior
final
adjudication
based
upon
alleged
error
of
fact
or
law.
turning
to
the
jurisdictional
issue,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
transfer
order.
the
transfer
order
was
not
a
final
order.
it
had
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the...
over
the
motion
because
it
considered
it
as
what
it
was.
it
was
a
second
or
successive
application.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
under
the
gatekeeping
authority
of
2244(b)(3)
of
aedpa,
then
the
sold
province
as
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
second
or
successive
application
should
be
granted
or
should
be
denied
is
in
the
province
of
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
you
can't
separate
these
two
functions.
under
aedpa,
and
under
the
clear
enactment
of
congress,
when
congress
gave
the
court
of
appeals
the
exclusive
and
sole
jurisdiction
as
to
whether
or
not
a...
an
application
or
leave
for
application
for
a
second
or
successive
should
be
granted
or
denied,
it
also
gave
them
the
exclusive
authority
to
determine
whether
it
was--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
well--
[laughter]
mr.
paul
g.
summers
it's
the
first
one,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
if
you
were
to
split
those
two
decisions
that
the
court
of
appeal
has
jurisdiction
over,
then
there
would
be
a
proliferation
of
appeal
of
that
first
predicate
decision.
the
decision,
the
first--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--your
honor,
i
don't...
i
would
not...
i
don't
think
this
is,
frankly,
an
extraordinary
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
a
second
or
successive.
that
is
to
say
that
when
the
sixth
circuit
got
the
transfer
order,
they
saw
just
what
it
was,
and
that
it
was
a
second
or
successive
application--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--yes,
your
honor.
what
they
asked
for
was
the
relitigation
of
a
claim
that
had
been...
that...
that--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--they...
they
asked
for...
they
asked
for
the
relitigation
of
a
prior
final
determination,
which
we...
we
submit
and
we...
our
position
is
that
this
was,
in
fact,
a
second--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--they
asked...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
they
asked
for
relief
from
the...
from
the
habeas
judgment
in
the...
in
the
district
court--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--well,
they
alleged
that
it
was
a
60(b)
motion,
but
when
the
district
court
received
the
motion,
the
district
court
put
substance
over
form
and
saw
clearly
that
it
was
a
second
or
successive--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--it
would
be
the
inherent
authority
of
the...
of
the
district
court
to
take
care
of
a
situation
of
fraud
on
the
court.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
well,
we
don't
think
it
would
even
have
to
be
a
60(b)
motion.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
fraud
on
the
court
that
would
impugn
the
very
integrity
of
the
prior
final
adjudication
would,
in
fact,
be...
be--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--yes.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
that's
right.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
if
there
was
a
fraud
on
the
court.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
but
that...
but
the
fraud
on
the
court
would
undermine
the
complete
efficacies
of
the
proceedings,
and
that
the
final
judgment
wouldn't
even
be
final,
because
it
would
be
a
sham.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
that...
i
mean,
that
could
be
a
possible
avenue,
but
that...
but
that
would
only
go
as
to
the
fraud
on
the
integrity--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--well--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--of...
of
course,
your
honor,
that
argument
would
fly
in
the
face
of
the
finality
requirements
of
aedpa,
which
only...
which
only
gives
us...
which
only
gives
us
limited
circumstances
to
relitigate--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--well,
but
in
the
fraud
case,
your
honor,
the
fraud
on
the
court
means
that
the
original
judgment
is
a
complete
sham,
is
a
complete
sham,
and
there
was
no--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--well,
they
want
it
both
ways,
if
it
please
the
court.
they
either
say
that
it
was
a
new
rule
or
an...
or
an
old
rule
that
clarified
tennessee
law.
if
it
was
a
new
rule,
then
that
would
contravene
2244(b)
under
aedpa.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
when
the--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--a
prior
final
determination...
a
prior
final
determination
by
the
district
court
as
to
the
procedural
default
should
be
conclusive.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
yes,
sir,
because...
because--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--well,
but
we...
yes,
your
honor,
but
under
the
provisions
of
aedpa
there
are
two
circumstances
where
he
could
file
a
second
or
successive,
which
we
say
is
what
he
has,
in
fact,
done
here.
one,
of
course,
is
if
it's
a
new
claim
involving
a
constitutional
law
that's
made
retroactive
by
this
very
court,
or
newly-discovered
evidence
to
show
factual
innocence,
but
when
that
court...
when
that
district
court...
makes
a
final,
a
prior
final
adjudication,
then
that
is...
that
should
be...
that
should
be
final.
he
should
appeal
that
decision.
he
should
appeal
that
decision--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--through
the
normal
appellate
process.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
he
did
not
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
yes,
your
honor.
if
the--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
if
this
petitioner
had
decided
that
instead,
the
district
court
found
that
he
had
improperly
exhausted
his
remedies
under
state
law,
that
he'd
showed
no
cause
of
prejudice
or
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice,
that
he
had
procedurally
defaulted,
and
that
he,
his
claim
was...
it
was
conclusive
that
he
had
no
habeas
relief,
if
the
petitioner
had
wanted
to
appeal
that...
had
wanted
to
find
out
whether
or
not
the
district
court
was
wrong...
he
should
have
appealed
that
case.
he
did
not.
under...
under
the
case
law
but
also
under
60(b)
doctrine
a
60(b)
motion
is
not
a
substitute
for
an
appeal.
he
did
not
appeal
that
adjudication
by
the
district
judge.
he's
out
of
business
so
far
as
that's
concerned.
what
he
filed
in
the
district
court,
the
district
judge
got
that
document,
he
looked
at
substance,
and
the
district
court
said,
this
is
a
second
or
successive.
the
only
jurisdiction
in
the
world
to
determine
whether
to
grant
or
deny
second
or
successive
is
the
court
of
appeals.
when
that
court
of
appeals
got
that
transfer
order,
there
was
no
termination.
they
got
what
was--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--well,
human
beings,
it's
certainly
possible.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
there
could
be
a
motion
to
transfer
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
if,
in
fact,
finds
that
it
was
improvidently
transferred,
could
transfer
it
back.
that
would
be
that
remedy,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
no,
your
honor.
if
it
was
a
mistake
of
fact,
if
it
did
not
go
to...
to
undermine
the
integrity
of
that
being
a
final
adjudication,
no.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
if
he
were...
if
it
were
something
of
the
nature
of...
of
denying
him
the
opportunity
to
have
a
hearing,
or
if,
in
fact--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--well,
no,
sir.
he
did...
he
received
a
hearing.
he
received
a
hearing,
your
honor,
that...
and
in
that
hearing
it
was
determined
by
the
court
that
he
had
improperly--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--failed
to
exhaust...
improperly,
that
he--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--failed
to
show
cause
of
prejudice,
that
there
was
no
miscarriage
of
justice,
and
that
he
was
conclusively
entitled
to
no
habeas
relief
in
the
district
court,
and
that
was
a
conclusive
final
determination,
and
if
he
had
felt
like
the
court
was
wrong,
he
should
have
filed
an
appeal
in
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
your
honor,
if
he
had
thought
the
judge
had
made
a
mistake,
he
should
have
appealed.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
well--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--well,
his
argument
that
tennessee
adopted
a
rule
that
either
is
a
new
rule
or
an
old
rule
is
not
of
much
import
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
because
the
rule
39
that
he
relies
upon
changed
nothing
in
tennessee
law--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--so
far
as
appellate
process.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
well,
i
think...
i
think
the
district
court
knew
what
the
law
was
when
he
made
that
decision,
but
certainly
the
sixth
circuit
knew
what
the
law
was.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--what
the
tennessee
court
later
decided,
your
honor,
did
not
change
tennessee
law
so
far
as
discretionary
review
at
all...
at
all.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
the
district
judge
was
exactly
correct
on
his
decision.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
the
decision
as
to
the
availability
of
a
remedy
is
a
state
decision.
the
decision
as
to
what
has
been
exhausted
is
a
federal
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
the
rule
39
that
the
petitioner
relies
upon
did
not
change
discretionary
review
in
tennessee
one
iota.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
tennessee
rule
of
appellate
procedure
11
says
in
its
comment
that
rule
39
does
not
change
trap...
as
we
call
it,
trap
11...
whatsoever.
discretionary
review
was
in
'95,
when
he
did
not
appeal
to
the
supreme
court,
as
well
as
in
june
28,
2001,
an
absolute
available
remedy
under
the
normal
appellate
processes
in
tennessee.
mr.
paul
g.
summers
your
honor,
our
view
is
that
the
district
court
was
right
in
1998
when
he
ruled
that
the
claims
were
procedurally
defaulted,
and
if
this
case...
if
this
case
were
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
today,
he
would
rule
that
the
claims
had
been
procedurally--
mr.
paul
g.
summers
--but
there's
no
question
that...
there
is
no
question
that
in
1998,
when
the
district
court
found
that
the...
that
the
issues
had
been
procedurally
defaulted,
and
that
there
had
been
no
showing
of
cause
in
prejudice,
no
miscarriage
of
justice,
that
that
was
a
conclusive
final
determination.
what
this...
what
this
petitioner
attempts
to
do
is
to...
under
the
guise
of
a
post-judgment
pleading...
avoid
or
evade
the
second
or
successive
restriction.
this
flies
in
the
face
of
aedpa,
would
be
a
mockery
of
the
finality
requirements
of
aedpa,
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
transfer
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
proper
transfer,
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
determined
the
gatekeeping
criteria
was
satisfied,
the
writ
should
be
dismissed
or,
in
the
alternative,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
