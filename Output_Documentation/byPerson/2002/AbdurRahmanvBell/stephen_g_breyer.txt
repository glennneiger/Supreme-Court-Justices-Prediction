justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--see
what
martinez-real
has
to
do
with
it.
i
may
be
missing
it,
but
i
thought
that
in...
in
this
case,
the
reason
that
you
cannot
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
order
refusing
to
give
you
permission
to
file
a
second
habeas
is
because
there's
a
statute
that
says
you
can't
come
to
this
court
when
a
court
of
appeals
refuses
to
give
permission
on
second
habeas,
and
none
of
that
was
involved,
to
my
knowledge,
in
martinez-real.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
a
question
about
whether
or
not
there
was
a
premature
decision,
or
whatever
it
was,
and
they
sent...
the
court
of
appeals
sent
it
back
for
adjudication
on
this
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it's...
i'm
not
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean,
martinez-real
was
a
grant
of
a
petition
for
second
or
successive?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then,
what
has
that
statute
to
do
with
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
martinez-real?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
was
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
so
then
the
statute
doesn't
apply,
i
guess--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i...
i
just
don't
see
how
you
get
around
the
statute
that
says
that
you
can't
come
here
after
a
court
of
appeals
either
grants
or
denies
the
second
or
successive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
wasn't
at
issue,
i
take
it,
in
the
other
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
you...
one
doesn't
really
ask
for
cert
from...
from
a
question.
one
asks
for
cert
to
review
an
order,
and
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
an
order
granting
or
denying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
that...
now,
this
will
get
to
the
merits,
which
i'm
sure
you'd
like
to
get
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
i
thought
that
the
argument
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
right
is
roughly
the
following,
that
what
your
client
should
have
done,
or
the
way
it
should
have
worked
is
that
the
district
court
initially
dismissed...
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
procedural
default...
his
initial
parts
of
the
initial
petition,
because,
said
the
district
court,
he
didn't
exhaust
those,
and
he
can't
do
it
now
because
the
time
is
up,
and
your
client
never
appealed
that
ruling
in...
the
first
time.
what
he
should
have
done
is
appealed
it.
then,
when
he
asked
for
cert
and
the
tennessee
statement
came
down,
he
would
simply
have
amended
his
cert
petition
and
allowed
us
to
gvr
in
light
of
our
case
in
tennessee,
but
he
couldn't
do
that,
because
he
hadn't
appealed
that
in
the
first
place,
and
therefore
he
had
a
final
ruling,
a
final
judgment
against
him
on
that
issue,
and...
and
that's
why...
that's
why
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
right,
and
that's
also
why
it
really
is
a
second
and
successive,
because
after
all,
you...
it's...
you
want
a
district
judge
to
reopen
a
judgment
where
he
made
a
mistake
but
you
didn't
appeal
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
the...
now
i'm
thinking,
when
i
read
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
again,
they're
not
really
saying
anything
different.
i
think
they
must
mean...
i
grant
you
it
can
be
read
either
way,
but
i
can't
believe
that
they
mean
every
60(b)
motion
no
matter
what
is
second
or
successive.
it
seems
to
have
arisen
in
cases
where
they
had
good
reason
to
think
that
the
60(b)
motion
in
that
case
was
second
or
successive,
as
in
your
case
they
are
looking
at
the
60(b)
motion
as
a
substitute
for
a
new
petition
for
the
reason
that
it
was
dismissed
the
first
time
as
a
procedural
default,
which
is
the
end
of
this
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
didn't
appeal
it.
rather,
for
whatever
set
of
reasons,
you
wait...
i
mean,
not
saying
it
was
your
fault,
but
you
wait
and
go
back
and
do
this
other
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
there...
is
there
really
a
minority
rule
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
some
court
that
really
meant
it,
that
no
matter
what,
60(b)
is
always
second
or
successive?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
you
didn't
appeal.
i
thought
you
did
not
appeal
the
first
time...
we're
back
in
the
year
2000,
or
early
2001.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
'99?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
at
that
time
i
thought
you
did
not
appeal
the
district
court's
ruling
that
you
had
procedurally
defaulted
because
you
hadn't
exhausted
claims
x,
y,
and
z,
and
the
time
had
run.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
so
i
don't
see
how
that
helps
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
isn't
the
right
way
to
do
this,
if
you
were
writing
it
from
scratch,
we
have
the
statute,
you
simply
say,
look,
this
is
what
second
and
successives
are
for.
when
the
law
changes
just
in
the
middle
of
the
case,
bring
a
second
and
successive.
that's
the
rare
case
where
it
should
be
allowed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
don't--
--but
i
mean
what
happened
to
you.
isn't
that
the
case
that
they're
there
for?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
the
right
way
to
do
it?
that
is,
in
your
opinion,
how...
suppose
we
had
a...
we
have
a
defendant,
a
petitioner,
a
convicted
person,
and
he
has
a
whole
lot
of
claims,
and
there
he
is
in
federal
court
and
he
brought
all
of
his
claims
up
to
the
state
supreme
court
but
for
three,
then
he
suddenly
thinks,
oh
my
god,
i
wish
i'd
brought
those
up,
too,
and
the
district
judge
says,
well,
you
sure
had
to,
so
you
lost
them,
because
it's
too
late
now.
procedural
default.
it
seems
obviously
right,
doesn't
even
appeal
that
part
of
the
case.
but
while
the
case
is
on
appeal,
this
court
says,
he
didn't
have
to
go
to
the
state
supreme
court
with
those
three
claims
if
the
state
supreme
court
agrees,
and
then
state
supreme
court
then
does.
all
right.
now,
there
he
is.
under
the
law
as
it
is
right
now,
he
can
make
his
three
points.
he
can
make
his
three
claims,
and
yet
as
it
was
before,
he
couldn't,
and
it's
right
on
the
case,
it's
still
ongoing.
what's
supposed
to
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
opinion
is
there
just...
is
there
no
way
a
person
could
say,
judge,
please
read
the
supreme
court
and
the
tennessee
court,
and
you'll
see
that
your
ruling
was
wrong,
and
believe
me,
that's
right,
so
what
is
he
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying
he's
just
out
of
luck,
nothing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
terribly
unfair--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
do
they
really
intend
in
congress
if,
for
example,
the
court
comes
up
with
an
interpretation
of
a
statute
that
shows
the
defendant
didn't
commit
a
crime,
and
there
he
is
in
habeas.
he's
got
a
final
ruling,
denied.
lo
and
behold
the
supreme
court
comes
up
with
a
case
to
say,
you
never
committed
a
crime.
he
looks
at
aedpa.
he
can't
find
it's
a
second
or
successive
because
it
says,
constitutional
ruling.
what's
he
supposed
to
do?
nothing?
and
do
you
think
congress
meant
that
there
was
no
remedy
at
all?
