justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
if
it
had
merely
been
a
change
in
tennessee
law,
that
would
not
have
been
a
predicate
for
a
second
and
successive
habeas,
would
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
it
strictly
in
the
province
of
the
sixth
circuit
to
determine
that
what
it
has
before
it
is
a
request
for
something
that
should
be
called
a
second
or
successive
petition
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
if
it
is,
they've
got
the
final
word,
but
whether
it
is
is
a
separate
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
didn't
do
so
in
so
many
words.
i
mean,
is
your
argument
that
if
we
split
this
question
into
a)
jurisdictional
fact,
b)
the
authority
of
the
court
if
the
jurisdictional
fact
is
present,
if
we
split
those
two
questions
that
there's
going
to
be
constant
litigation
over
the
jurisdictional
fact,
and
that's
why
we
ought
to
read
the
statute
your
way,
or
is
there
some
point
of
text
that
is
not
occurring
to
me
that
supports
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
one
or
the
other.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
text
or
policy?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
going
to
be...
i
mean,
is
it
going
to
be
a
difficult
question
in
most
cases?
i
mean,
this
is
an
extraordinary
case.
you
can
see
how
the
jurisdictional
fact
question
gets
raised
here,
but
you
know,
in
most
cases
is
this
going
to
be
even
a
colorable
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he's
doing
it
simply
because
he
is
saying,
i
guess,
that's
where
i'm
trying
to
get
to
ultimately.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
it's
an
adjudication
that
has
finality,
which
merits
adjudications
usually
do,
but
it's
a
finality
adjudication
that
does
not
rest
upon
any
finding
about
the
underlying
merits
of
the
claim
that
he
wanted
to
bring
for
relief.
isn't
that
clear?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
asking
you
whether
it's...
i'm
just
asking
you
as
a
descriptive
matter--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
and
we
use
the
term,
i
think...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
we
use
the
term,
merits
determination,
to
refer
to
a
determination
that
is
binding,
i.e.,
he
can't
do
something
back
in
the
state
court
and
then
come
back
and
try
again
here.
we
call
that
a
determination
on
the
merits,
but
there
are
two
kinds
of
merits
determinations.
one
is
a
finding
of
default
which
cannot
be
cured.
second
is
a
finding
which
may
involve
default,
but
may
involve
a
determination
on
the
merits
of
the
underlying
claim,
and
this
is
just
a
default
kind
of
merits,
not
an
underlying
claim
kind
of
merits
finality,
isn't
that
correct,
just
as
a
descriptive
matter?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
you
can
and
maybe
you
can't.
his
argument
here
is,
this
is
one
that
i
ought
to
be
allowed
to
relitigate,
i.e.,
to
litigate
despite
a
finality
judgment,
because
of
something
very
unusual
that
happened
as
a
result
of
the
supreme
court's
rule
change.
what
he's
saying
is,
this
is
a
special
kind
of...
third
kind
of
case
in
the
middle,
and
you
want
to
treat
this
one
for
60(b)
purposes
like
a
nonfinal
determination.
i
think
that's
the
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
may
be
wrong
that
it's
an
exceptional
case,
but
that's
the
argument
that
he's
making,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
he's
not
making
that
blanket
statement.
he's
saying
that
in
a
case
like
this,
in
which
the
finality
which
is
claimed
does
not
rest
on
a
merits
determination,
i
ought
to
have
a
chance
under
60(b).
