mr.
james
s.
liebman
okay.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
i'd
like
to
take
up
first
is
why,
in
our
view,
the
unusual
circumstances
of
this
case
satisfy
the
two
sets
of
demanding
requirements
that
are
on
the
petitioner
here
to
succeed:
1)
he
has
to
show
that
this
is
not
a
successive
petition,
and
2)
he
then
additionally
has
to
get
over
the
high
hurdle
that
60(b)
imposes.
let
me,
though,
go
first
to
the
jurisdictional
questions
that
your
honor
referred
to.
this
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
three
ways.
it
was
there
because
mr....
the
petitioner
here
went
into
the
district
court
and
he
said,
here's
my
60(b)
motion,
i'd
like
to
get
60(b)
relief.
the
district
court...
and
this
is
on
pages
42
through
44
of
the
record,
of
the
joint
appendix...
said
very,
very
clearly
that
it
was
going
to
make
two
rulings.
first
it
said,
this
is
not
a
rule
60(b)
motion,
it
is
something
else,
it's
a
successive
petition.
because
it's
a
successive
petition,
you
cannot
get
60(b)
relief
in
this
court,
and
i'm
going
to
refer
or--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--right.
what
i...
but
what
that
did,
your
honor,
was
to
establish
a
final
disposition.
it
terminated
all
of
the
petitioner's
rights
under
60(b).
there
were
no
rights
left.
he
told
the
district
court--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--he
did.
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
it
was
final
for
purposes
of
the
60(b),
because
the...
for
purposes
of
the
district
court's
view
there
could
be,
would
be,
never
could
be
any
60(b)
relief.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
your
honor,
all
of
that's
right,
and
if
the
belts
don't
work,
let's
go
to
the
suspenders.
he...
the
case
was
transferred
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
could
not
take
jurisdiction
over
the
case
unless
the
prerequisite
for
its
jurisdiction
was
established,
and
if
you
look
at
2244(b)(3),
which
is
in
our
appendix
to
our
brief
at
page
1a--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--1a
of
the
blue
brief,
it's
very
clear
under
(b)(3)(a)
that
it
has
to
be
a
second
or
successive
application
before
the
court
of
appeals
has
any
jurisdiction
to
do
anything
with
it,
so
its
jurisdiction
turns
on
the
question
whether
it
was
a
successive
petition
or
not.
if
it
wasn't
one,
it
could
not
act
under
this
statute
and
would
have
to
remand
back
to
the
district
court.
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
the
martinez-villareal
case.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
yes.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
it
was
not
done
here
because
he
was
saying
all
along
this
was
not
a
successive
petition,
if
it
was,
he
would
not
satisfy
it.
he--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--he
was
saying
that
he
did
satisfy
the
requirements
of
60(b),
that
the
statute
recognizes
a
difference
between
certain--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--oh
but,
your
honor,
in
martinez-villareal,
i
think
it's
very
clear
this
case
is
exactly
the
same
as
martinez-villareal,
which
this
court
ruled
expressly
on
the...
the
first
question
it
took
up
was
the
jurisdictional
question.
what
happened
there
is
that
the
petitioner
went
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
said,
this
is
a
successive
petition,
i'm
transferring,
you
can't
be
in
this
court.
he
then
took
an
appeal,
and
he
went
up
on
a
transfer
saying,
okay,
you've
got
the
transferred
motion
in
front
of
you.
the
court
of
appeals
actually
dismissed
the
appeal
saying,
we
don't
have
that,
but
it
decided
in
the
context
of
the
transfer...
and
this
is
very
standard
procedure
here
now
under
aedpa...
it
decided,
first
question
first,
do
we
have
jurisdiction,
and
it
said,
you
know
what,
we
figured
out
that
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
because
this
is
not
a
successive
petition,
so
we
remand
back
to
the
district
court.
this
court
then
took
cert
on
that
question,
and
the
first
question
it
asked
was,
do
we
have
cert
here
because
of
subsection
(e)
here,
and
it
said,
we
do
have
cert
here
because
(e)
is
very
clear.
the
grant
or
denial
of
authorization
can't
come
to
the
court.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
absolutely.
in
fact,
it
has
the
obligation,
not
just
the
jurisdiction,
to
decide
whether
it
is
a
successive
petition,
because
if
it
isn't,
it
can't
decide
the
case,
because
then
it's
got
to
start
with
the
district--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--oh,
well
i...
i'm
not
actually
sure
it's
the
first
clause.
it
says
that
the
applicant
shall
move
in
the
appropriate
court
for
an
order
authorizing
that.
that's
what
essentially
gives
the
court
the
jurisdiction,
but
it's
got
to
be
for
an
order
authorizing
what
qualifies
under
the
statute
as
a
second
and
successive
application.
this
was
not
a
second
and
successive
application.
therefore,
as
in
martinez-villareal--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--right,
but
that...
his
position
was
it
was
not,
and
therefore
the
court
needed
to
dismiss
that
case,
and
it
had
two
options
at
that
point.
it
could
either
remand
it
back,
which
is
the
majority
approach,
or
it
could
simply
have
dismissed,
and
then
he
could
have
gone
back
and
filed
in
the
district
court
again,
which
is
what
a
few
courts
do.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
that
did
not
happen,
your
honor,
although
petitioner
understood
the
court's
decision,
if
you
look
on
pages
41
and
42,
to
say
this...
it
expressly
says,
you
cannot
file
60(b)
here
in
this
court
because
it's
automatically
successive.
you
cannot
do
it.
you
will
never
get
any
rights
under
60(b).
mr.
james
s.
liebman
he
could
have,
but
in...
your
honor,
in
the
martinez-villareal
case,
there
was
no
such
question,
no...
no--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--oh,
yes--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
the
provision
(e)
here
says
that
the
grant
or
denial
of
an
authorization
cannot
come
up
to
the
court
on
cert,
so
the
fact
that
the
court
there
in--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no.
it
was--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--what
it
said
was...
and
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
martinez-villareal
quite
clearly.
there's
a
threshold
question.
the
threshold
question
is,
do
we
have
in
front
of
us
a
second
or
successive
petition.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
yes.
yes,
yes,
yes.
that
was
the
question
there,
because
martinez-villareal
filed
a
request
to--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--it
said,
the
answer
is,
this
is
not
a
second
or
successive
petition.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
oh...
but
here
the
court
said...
if
i
can
be
clear
about
this...
the
court
said
two
things,
and
it
said
them
actually
in
different
orders.
january
18
order,
it
said,
this
is
a
successive
petition,
so
now
we've
got
to
go
to
the
gateway
question
of
whether
you
can
get
into
court.
and
then
a
couple
of
weeks
later,
actually
almost
a
month
later,
february
11,
it
said,
you
don't
meet
the
gateway
requirement.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
that's
what
i'm--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
the
very
first
thing
that
our
cert
petition
says
in
this
case
is,
we
are
not
asking
for
cert
from
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
meet
the
gateway
requirement.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
this
order
had
multiple
parts,
your
honor.
it
was
actually
divided
up
into
multiple
parts,
and
what
he
said
was,
we
are
asking
for
cert
from
some
parts
of
the
order,
segmented
out
and
given
paragraphs.
we
are
not
asking
for
cert
from
other
parts
of
that
decision.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
this
was
not
a
denial.
what
the
statute
says...
and
i
think
that's
really
important...
is
the
grant...
i'm
reading
(e),
as
we
go
over
from
(1)(a)
to
(2)(a).
the
grant
or
denial
of
an
authorization
by
a
court
of
appeals
to
file
a
second
or
successive
application
shall
not
be
appealable,
but
he
was
not
appealing
the
grant
or
denial.
he
was
appealing
the
preliminary
question
whether
it
even
was,
whether
the
court
even
could
have
taken
jurisdiction
of
that
because
it
had
a
second
or
successive--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
your
honor,
then
let
me
go
to
the
garter
if
the
belts
and
suspenders
haven't
worked
here.
petitioner
filed
a
motion
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
his
original
appeal,
and
he
said,
in
this
appeal,
what
we
would
like
you
to
do
is,
rather
than
issuing
the
mandate
on
the
judgment
that
you
issued
before,
which
went
up
on
cert,
we
would
like
you
to
remand
this
case
in
order
for
the
court
below
to
take
up
these
issues,
whether
on
60(b)
or
in
other
ways,
and
the
court
denied
that
motion.
it
didn't
say
why,
but
it
denied
that
motion
without,
expressly
in
regard
to
that,
doing
any
kind
of
gatewaying.
it
just
said,
we
deny
it.
now,
it
gives
the
reason
in
the
earlier
january
18
order
that
it
thought
that
any
post
judgment
motion
in
one
of
these
cases
was
automatically
successive,
and
that's
our
first
question--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--which
is,
that
was
a
mistake--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--yes.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
your
honor,
you're
absolutely
right,
the
premise,
which
is
that
rule
60(b)
or
related
motions
in
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
be
used
to
fill
the
office
of
an
appeal,
but
there's
a
very
established
doctrine
there.
it
came
up
in
the
muniz
case,
in
the
blackmon
v.
money
remand
that
this
court
made,
and
the
question
there
is
whether
it
was
reasonably
available
to
him
at
that
moment
to
make
an
appeal.
if
it
was,
60(b)
doesn't
come
into
play,
and
that's
perhaps
the
most
important
question
in
this
case.
as
of
the
time
mr.
abdur'
rahman
filed
his
brief,
his
first
brief,
opening
brief
in
the
tennessee...
i
mean,
in
the
sixth
circuit
on
august
5,
1999,
this
court's
o'sullivan
decision
had
come
down
two
months
earlier.
o'sullivan
read
a
rule
of
illinois
procedure
establishing
a
discretionary
review
process
that
is
identical
in
terms.
the
state
of
alabama
has
actually
gone
through
the
terms
in
its
brief
and
shown
that
they're
identical.
this
court
said,
and
i
quote,
without
more,
those
words
are
not
sufficient
to
tell
us
that
that
discretionary
procedure
is
outside
the
ordinary
post-conviction
review
process
in
that
state.
in
this
state
of
tennessee
at
the
time,
there
was
that
rule,
identical
to
the
rule
in
o'sullivan,
and
nothing
more
in
the
law.
in
fact,
the
state
concedes
in
its
brief
that
there
was
nothing
in
tennessee
law
at
the
time
besides
the
rule.
so
it
was
not
available
to
him
at
that
point
for
the
very
reason
that
if
he
had
made
that
argument,
it
would
have
been
a
frivolous
argument
because
it
would
have
run
foursquare
into
the
precise
holding
of
a
decision
of
this
court
but
two
months
before.
it
was
only
when
rule
39
came
down
after
the
appeal
was
over,
while
the
case
was
on
cert,
that
it
said
no,
no,
no,
no,
the
law
of
tennessee
has
been
since
1967
that
our
discretionary
review
procedure
in
rule
11
has
never
been
part
of
the
regular
and
routine
state
post-conviction
review
process
that
we
have--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--yes,
we
do.
we
cite--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--we
cite
both
of
them
on--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
i
believe
that
they
are
cited
in
our...
well,
i
guess
you're
right.
i
thought
we
had
cited
them
in
the
reply
brief,
but
we
make
reference
to
them
where
we
point
out,
if
i
can
find
it
here...
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
on
page
3
of
our
reply
brief,
the
yellow
brief,
we
cite
pitchess
and
browder.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
we
didn't.
the
state
raised
them,
and
we
responded
to
them,
and
the
point
is
that
we
actually
think
that
martinez-villareal
and
slack
stand
on
top
of
pitchess
and
browder,
so
that
they
were
obviously
decided
in
that
same
context,
and
so
we
cited
the
more
recent
case,
but
in
any
event
in
our
reply
brief,
what
we
point
out
is,
this
court
has
been
very
clear
to
say,
is
there
a
conflict
between
a
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
and
the
habeas
jurisprudence?
if
so,
the
civil
rule
doesn't
apply.
if
not,
it
does
apply,
and
as
almost
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
held,
there
are
certain
very
limited
circumstances
when
a
60(b)
motion
does
not
interfere
with
the
policies
of
the
habeas
jurisprudence,
and
in
those
limited
number
of
cases,
which
includes
this
one,
it
is
appropriate
to
use
60(b).
mr.
james
s.
liebman
oh,
no.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
no,
your
honor.
we
don't
at
all
stand
on
the
second
circuit
approach
to
this.
the
majority
rule
is
that
it
is
a
case-by-case
analysis.
it's...
for
example...
the
dunlap
case
where
judge
posner
recently
cited
all
of
the
lower
court
opinions,
and
what
he
said
was,
the
majority
rule
is
that
you
have
to
look.
you
have
to
say,
is
this
the
kind
of
60(b)
that
avoids
the
problems
that
successive
petitions
are...
cause
that
we
have
a
rule
for?
if
they
do,
decide
the
60(b)
motion.
if
not--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--we
filed
the
rule--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--but
it
was
the
key
point--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--yes.
yes.
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--i
think
3-1/2
years
is
the
right...
but
the
reason
is
that
the
trigger
for
the
60(b)
motion
did
not
come
down
until
june
2001.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
your
honor,
two
points.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--that
is
the
argument
that
the
state
made
here,
and
it's
what
the
district
court
said,
and
i
can
tell
you
the
district
court
believed
it,
but
it
doesn't
matter
here.
i
don't
want
to
get
off
on
that,
because
we
think
that
whatever
the
rule
ought
to
be,
this
is
the
kind
of
60(b)
motion
that
is
not
successive
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
is...
it
relies
upon
legal
and
factual
issues
that
are
entirely
within
the
four
corners
of
the
original
proceeding.
there's
nothing
new
here.
the
law,
the
facts,
the
evidence,
everything
is
the
same.
secondly,
so
that
means
you're
not
getting
out--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
but
it
isn't
new,
your
honor.
it
was
a
declaration
of
the
law
as
it
existed
all
the
way
back
in
1967.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
but
it's
like
the
fiore
case,
your
honor,
where
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
said
yes,
we
came
down
with
this
interpretation
of
the
state
statute,
and
it's
true
the
lower
courts
had
all
seen
it
differently
up
to
that
point,
but
we
were
telling
you
what
the
statute
meant
all
the
way
back,
and
this
court
treated
it
as,
quote,
old
law.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
because--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
your
honor,
what
o'sullivan
says
is,
if
there
is
a
clear
statement
of
law
by
state
law,
by
rule
or
decision
that
says...
as
the
south
carolina-arizona
provisions
cited
in
this
paragraph
say...
that
this
particular
discretionary
review
procedure,
quote,
is
not
available,
then
the
supreme
court
and
the
federal
courts
will
respect
it,
but
otherwise,
if
we
don't
know
what
the
law
is,
or
it's
not
clear,
then
we
don't
need
to
respect
it,
so
that
was--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--the
state's
brief
was
filed
before,
petitioner's
brief
filed
after.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
oh,
your
honor,
that's
a
very
important
point.
in
our
certificate
of
probable
cause
to
appeal
we
asked
the
district
judge,
starting
with
point
1,
the
prosecutorial
misconduct
claims
and
the
procedural
default
ruling
on
them
is
what
we
want
to
take
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
our
appeal,
and
the
district
court
granted
a
cpc...
a
certificate
of
probable
cause...
on
that
ground,
so
that
was
in
the
case,
it
was
in
the
appeal,
and
it
was
specifically
in
the
mind...
well,
it
was
on
the
paper
that
this
was
the
issue
that
the
cross-appeal
was
going
to
be
focused
on.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
'99,
actually.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
yes.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
all
i
would
say--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--you're
right,
but
they
were
in
the
certificate
of
probable
cause,
which
is...
you
have
to
get
that
first,
but
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
reach
your
certificate
of
probable
cause.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
i'm
just
saying...
well,
it
does
help
in
this
sense,
your
honor,
i
think,
which
is
that
until
o'sullivan
came
down
and
removed
the
argument
that
petitioner
thought
he
had,
he
was
planning
to
raise
it,
but
when
o'sullivan
came
down,
after
the
cpc,
but
before
he
actually
got
to
file
his
brief,
now
suddenly
the
claim
that
he
wanted
to
raise
looked
frivolous,
because
there
was
not
a
declaration
of
state
law
on
the
point.
there
came
to
be
a
declaration
of
state
law,
and
when
it
came
sua
sponte,
it
happened
to
say,
because
the
court
in
tennessee
believed
that
this
to
be...
was
the
case...
that
the
law
of
tennessee
has
always
been
since
1967
that
this
was
never
part
of
the
post-conviction
review
process,
so--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no,
it
has
not.
the
issue
is
percolating
in
the
lower
courts
and
in
the
sixth
circuit,
but
it
has
not
ruled
yet.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
they
said
that
in
kentucky
based
upon
a
kentucky
supreme
court
decision
in
1985.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
after
that
point,
there
are
five
or
six
decisions
of
the
sixth
circuit
saying
that
failure
to
exhaust
that
remedy
is
failure
to
exhaust.
there
is
no
similar
decision
in
tennessee
at
all
in
the
court
of
appeals
before
o'sullivan
came
down,
because
the
understanding
of
practice
there,
and
i
know
because
i
practiced
there
at
that
time,
was
that
this
didn't
need
to
be
exhausted.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
the
law
did
not
change.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
this...
the
second
and
successive
is
designed
to
avoid
every
change
in
the
law
being
the
basis
for
a
habeas
petition,
but
this
is
not
a
change
in
the
law.
it's
exactly...
every
petitioner
literally
argued
that
not
only
is
this
discretionary,
so
it
should
not
be
exhausted,
but
he
also
said
the
nature
of
this
discretionary
process
shouldn't
be
exhausted
because
it's
different
from
post-conviction.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
absolutely.
if
it
is
a
change
of
law,
it's
preempted
by
the
terms
of
the
successive
statute
which
says,
we've
got
a
rule
here
for
changes
in
the
law,
but
that's
why
this
isn't
successive,
because
this
is
not
a
change
in
the
law,
it's
within
the
four
corners--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no,
your
honor--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
the
state
agrees
if
it's
fraud,
if...
martinez-villareal,
where
you've
got
some
state
court
decision
that
changes
everything--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--it's
got
to
be--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--no,
no,
no,
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
that
there
are
certain
circumstances
where
something
that
is
literally
second
in
time
does
not
qualify
as
a
second
or
successive
petition
that
triggers
2244,
and
so
we
need
to
know
what
that
is,
and
the
two
standards
are
when
it
is
within
the
four
corners
of
the
first
petition
and
it
completely
undermines--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--the
authority
is
martinez-villareal,
slack,
and
calderon,
and
a
huge
body
of
lower
court
law
that
establishes
those
very,
very
narrow
circumstances
where
it's
so
tied
into
the
first
petition
because
it's
the
same
facts,
and
it
so
undermines
that
first
judgment
that
there's
no
judgment
left,
that
you
need
something
to
substitute
for
it,
but
you
don't
have
a
successive
petition.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
yes,
i
am.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
pages
12
and
13
of
our
reply
brief,
the
yellow
brief.
on
those
pages,
in
the
footnote
in
the
text
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
are
cited.
every
single
one
of
those
cases
is
a
60(b)
case
in
a
habeas
or
2255
situation
where
60(b)
was
granted,
relief
was
granted
and
it
was
determined
that
this
was
not
a
second
or
successive
petition.
in
each
one
of
those
cases,
the
reason
was
mistake
of
law,
the
u.s.
supreme
court
or
some
other
court
came
down
with
a
new
decision,
and
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
that
issue
was
not
raised
on
direct
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
came
back
on
a
60(b).
in
each
case
they
had
to
adjudicate
the
question
of
whether
it
was
reasonable
for
them
not
to
have
raised
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
that
time,
and
in
each
case
they
did
on
the
ground
that
the
new
decision
that
came
down
changed
everything,
and
it
suddenly
made
what
looked
like
a
frivolous
claim
at
that
time
into
what
was
not
a
frivolous
claim,
but,
indeed,
one
on
which
there
was
at
least
a
right
to
adjudication
on
the
merits.
in
some
cases
they
won,
in
some
they
lost
when
they
went
to
the
merits
after
they
got
their
60(b)
relief,
but
the
fact
is
that
those
cases,
including
this
court's
gvr
in
blackmon
v.
money,
which
was
a
60(b)
case
on
a
successive,
or
a
second,
not
a
successive
but
a
second
habeas
petition,
were
cases
where
they
had
not
been
raised
on
appeal,
but
they...
they
were
determined
to
be
at
least
potentially
ones
where
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
not
having
done
it,
and
frivolousness,
not
making
frivolous
claims
is
such
a
basis.
this
court
in
gomez
and
other
cases
has
been
particularly
emphatic
that
habeas
petitioners
should
not...
especially
in
capital
cases...
should
not
be
raising
frivolous
claims.
the
second
thing
i
want
to
point
to
is
that
the
2244(b)(3)(e),
which
says
that
there
is
no...
it
not
only
says
the
supreme
court
can't
take
a
cert
petition,
it
says
that
rehearing
petitions
can't
be
held
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
the
court
of
appeals
are
unanimous
in
saying,
if
the
question
is
whether
this
is
a
second
or
successive
petition,
that
can
be
reheard.
that's
not
governed
by
2244(b)(3)(e).
we
can
separate
that
question
out,
and
we
can
decide
that,
and
it's
exactly
the
same
thing
here.
the
key
case
there
is
mancuso
in
the
second
circuit,
166
f.
3d
97,
so
the
courts
have
been
separating
out
those
questions,
saying
if
it's
a
question
of
jurisdiction--
