justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
liebman,
initially
in
this
case,
when
the
district
judge
transferred...
i
think
it
got
one
on
the
state's
recommendation
that
that's
how
you
handle
these
cases.
on
behalf
of
the
defendant,
did
anyone
ever
say,
please
enter
judgment
against
me
under
60(b),
i
want
to
make
this...
test
whether
this
is
a
60(b)
case
or
a
habeas
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
could
have
asked
to
test
that.
he
could
have
said,
please
don't
transfer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
then
you
said
you
didn't
need
to
put
it
in
your...
make
a
cross-appeal
of
it
because
you
didn't
think
it
was
a
tenable
argument,
so
you
can't...
i
don't...
i
don't
see
how
you
could
have
it
both
ways,
to
say
it
was
the
law
all
along,
but
we
didn't
have
to
say
that
that
was
the
law
because
o'sullivan--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--hadn't
come
down,
or
had
just
come
down.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
appellate...
the
appellate
brief
in
this
case,
the
brief
in
the
sixth
circuit,
when
the...
when
the
prosecutor
was
appealing
on
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
that
was
filed
before
o'sullivan
came
down,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
point
at
which
you
could
have
filed
a
cross-appeal
was
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
summers--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
summers--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you...
are
you...
you're
making
the
general
point
that's
not
peculiar
to
aedpa?
i...
tell
me
if
my
understanding
is
correct...
that
60(b)
is
not
supposed
to
do
service
in
place
of
an
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
a
district
court
rules
incorrectly,
and
you
didn't
appeal
that,
and
then
there's
a
clarifying
decision
by
some
other
court
that
really
shows
the
district
court
was
incorrect
on
the
procedural
default,
you
can't
then
say,
ah,
give
me
the
relief
under
60(b)
that
i
could
have
gotten
if
i
had
taken
a
timely
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
wholly
apart
from
aedpa.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
question.
that's
the
ultimate
question
that
i
think
this
court
granted
cert
to
decide,
but
then
we
discovered
that
there
are
all
these...
this
procedural...
the
question
whether
a
tennessee
court
saying
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
does
service
for
the
federal
courts.
that
is,
the
federal
courts
could
say
it's
an
open
question.
you
have
to
exhaust
the
remedies
that
are
available
to
you.
you
could
have
requested
review.
you
didn't
request
review.
we
don't
care
if
tennessee
says,
ah,
you
don't
have
to,
because
that's...
that
ruling
would
be
made
only
for
purposes
of
saying,
let's
get
into
the
federal
court.
i
take
it
that's
your
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
on
your
view,
the
district
court
was
right
when
the
district
court
said
the
first
time
around,
sorry,
you
didn't
exhaust.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that...
we
don't
know
that
because
i
think
it's
an
open
question
whether...
after
o'sullivan...
the
position
taken
in
o'sullivan
would
apply
when
the
state
court
says
you
don't
have
to
exhaust.
