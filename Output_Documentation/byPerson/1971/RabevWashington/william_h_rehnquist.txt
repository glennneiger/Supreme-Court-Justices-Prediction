justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
conceding
then
that
the
state
of
washington
could
have
legislated
so
as
to
prevent
the
showing
of
this
film
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
shown
with
the
exposure
to
people
outside
the
drive-in?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
cover
a
situation
such
as
your
state
supreme
court
found
to
exist
here
where
at
least
the
people
in
these
houses
were
exposed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
is
your
complaint
here
basically
lanzetta
versus
new
jersey
type
of
complaint
that
you
weren't
given
fair
warning
of
what
the
state
intended
to
punish
criminal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
also
--
that
is
your
only
complaint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
then
that
the
state
legislation
must
be
so
narrowly
drawn
as
to
require
proof
on
the
part
of
the
state
that
someone
was
actually
on
this
overpass
or
in
this
house
seeing
it
rather
than
a
reasonable
probability
that
it
might
occur?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
you
are
saying
that
the
state
does
indeed
have
to
show
that
actual
person's
view
from
outside
the
theater,
juveniles
or
people
who
didn't
want
to
be
in
order
to
make
this
a
criminal
offense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
couldn't
your
client
have
gotten
another
copy
of
the
film
from
somewhere?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
he
wasn't
adjoined
from
showing
it,
he
was
prevented
by
the
film
being
out
of
his
possession?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ludwig
i
read
justice
mcgowan's
opinion
as
finding
the
picture
only
partially
obscene.
i
didn't
read
in
his
finding
it
obscene
in
a
traditional
sense
of
an
entire
judgment
on
the
whole
film.
am
i
wrong?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ludwig
is
that
your
contention
that
when
you're
dealing
with
people
who
are
unwilling
viewers
or
with
juveniles,
that
the
type
of
material
which
the
state
may
proscribe
need
not
necessarily
need
all
three
of
the
obscenity
clauses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
aren't
you
saying
mr.
ludwig
that
when
you're
dealing
with
obscenity
in
the
context
that
juvenile
in
the
sense
in
the
context
of
unwilling
viewers,
it
may
have
a
broader
definition?
