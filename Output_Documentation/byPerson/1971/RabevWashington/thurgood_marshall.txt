involve
drive-in
in

justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
there
anything
–
is
it
true
in
this
(inaudible)
there
were
houses
nearby
where
somebody
can
sit
on
the
porch
and
see?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
to
stop
a
young
kid
from
standing
and
seeing
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
see
any
difference
between
that
and
a
closed
theater
that
doesn't
not
allow
children?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
see
any
difference
between
that
and
the
situation
in
a
closed

that
does
not
admit

of
findings
of
facts
that
says
that
said
park
y
drive
is
a
residential
area
and
an
overpass
providing
a
clear
view
of
the
screen
to
residents
of
the
area
and
passing
motorists.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
i
assume
that
where
there
is
an
overpass,
there
is
some
people
on
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
this
is
a
finding
of
fact
here.
it
says
that
a
overpass
was
there
and
it's
clear
enough
for
them
to
see
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
back
to
my
point
and
maybe
i
am
in
agreement,
on
page
81,
an
opinion
of
judge
mcgowan,
on
both
occasions
teenage
and
younger
children
were
observed
by
the
officer
to
be
watching
the
motion
picture
from
various
points
outside
the
theater
fence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
agree
with.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
just
getting
facts
for
my
own
self
as
to
whether
that
picture
was
available
for
children
to
see,
that's
one
point
i
am
interested
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
home
owner's
right
of
privacy
not
to
see
any
movie
or
not
to
be
disturbed
by
the
picture
there
or
what
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
in
the
world
do
you
get
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
recognize
that
you
do
not
have
a
state
statute,
that's
what
i
am
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
states
could
very
well,
i
understand
mr.
dwyer
admit
that
the
state
could
pass
such
a
statute
and
so
you
can
show
these
where
they
are
being
seen
by
unwilling
people,
but
you
haven't
passed
the
statute.
you
only
have
the
one
statute
which
obviously
--
well,
how
long
this
statute
has
been
on
the
book?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
we
can
say
before
drive-ins?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
but
wouldn't
you
assume
so
and
so
the
whole
point
is
that
the
statute,
you
haven't
passed
such
a
statute.
you
wanted
to
use
the
old
statute
to
apply
to
the
interference
of
the
right
of
privacy
of
the
person
who
lives
across
the
road
and
his
answer
is,
you
could
do
it
by
statute,
but
you
can't
do
it
without
the
statute.
now
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
it
involve
drive-in
in
maryland?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
there
anything
–
is

you

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
court
has
said
so?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
dwyer,
i
might
take
you
back
for
a
minute.
