mr.
curtis
ludwig
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
motion
picture
carmen
baby
is
played
on
a
large
outdoor
screen
is
obscene.
its
dominate
theme
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest
in
sex
and
the
court
below
has
so
held.
now
considering
the
use
and
the
manner
of
display,
the
washington
state
supreme
court
following
a
careful
review
to
decisions
of
this
court
properly
and
justifiably
found
this
movie
obscene.
the
washington
state
court
--
mr.
curtis
ludwig
no,
there
haven't
mr.
justice
douglas,
none
at
all
in
my
jurisdiction
regarding
this
movie
or
any
other
to
my
knowledge.
you
asked
earlier
about
the
standard
in
washington
regarding
punishment
or
penalties
in
general.
i
know
of
no
other
reported
cases
concerning
obscenity,
sustaining
of
conviction
in
our
jurisdiction
other
than
state
versus
rabe.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
think
mr.
justice
–
formerly
justice
mcgowan's
opinion
was
probably
the
best
written
brief
submitted
more
or
less
to
this
court
in
a
way.
what
he
said
was
that
the
dominant
theme
of
that
movie
appealed
to
the
prurient
interest
in
sex
and
in
the
context
of
its
display,
it
was
obscene.
that
court
and
in
their
opinion
indicated
that
we
are
obviously
not
judging
the
obscenity
in
the
abstract.
the
declaration
of
obscenity
was
aided
by
a
specific
set
of
circumstances,
involving
outdoor
display
of
a
movie
which
the
opinion
says
had
a
dominant
theme
appealing
to
the
prurient
interest.
now,
i
like
to
distinguish
this.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
yes
your
honor,
i
am
aware
of
that
and
i
was
going
to
try
and
lead
into
how
i
feel
he
interpreted
that
or
how
i
interpret
that.
as
i
said
–
indicate,
i
would
like
to
make
a
distinction
between
state
of
washington
versus
rabe
and
the
opinion
in
the
court
below
and
this
court's
opinion
in
a
book
versus
attorney
general.
as
i
said
i
have
done
page
9
of
our
brief
a
short
exert
from
that
opinion.
it
was
expressly
indicated
by
mr.
justice
brennan
that
that
material
was
judged
in
the
abstract
and
that
it
was
expressly
pointed
out
at
circumstances
of
production,
sale
and
publicity
are
relevant
to
a
determination
of
obscenity.
petitioner
here
has
continually
referred
to
the
the
film
as
non-obscene,
that's
the
language
of
this
brief,
that's
his
comments
to
the
court
today.
he
suggests
in
his
reply
brief
on
page
one
and
he
suggested
to
your
honors
today,
that
we
practically
concede
that
non-obscenity.
on
the
contrary
the
respondent
urges
and
the
court
below
determined
that
it
is
in
fact
obscene.
petitioner's
conviction
under
the
state's
obscenity
statute
rests
solely
on
that
determination.
now
what
the
court
below
and
what
justice
mcgowan
said
in
his
opinion
was
simply
that
in
an
abstract
determination
the
film
would
probably
pass
the
roth-memoirs
definition
of
obscenity.
opinion
below
suggests
in
paraphrasing
that
some
might
find
it
not
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value,
but
in
the
context
of
its
display,
in
the
outdoor
theater,
hoisted
up
on
the
nearby
residency,
it
was
in
fact
obscene.
in
that
particular
regard
i
have
noted,
would
interest
the
morality
amicus
curiae
brief
which
urges
that
the
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
is
not
part
of
the
test
for
obscenity
established
by
roth
and
we
need
not
reach
that
issue
here.
in
my
view,
whether
social
value
is
or
is
not
or
privately
test,
should
be
important
only
in
an
abstract
determination
of
obscenity.
i
say
that
because
assuming
that
morality
is
wrong
in
their
amicus
brief
and
assuming
that
other
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
is
a
part
of
the
test
and
assuming
for
the
moment
that
carmen
baby
has
some
redeeming
social
value.
that
social
value
is
certainly
going
to
be
lost
or
obscured
to
those
unwilling
viewers
of
this
outdoor
display.
now
petitioner
rabe
completely
overlooks
that
fact
and
he
suggests
in
his
brief
on
page
20
that
if
the
householder
took
time
to
watch
the
entire
film,
it
would
presumably
be
restored
to
constitutional
protection.
now
that's
really
a
novel
unique
idea.
picture
if
you
will,
a
home
owner
who
views
an
erotic
scene,
very
offensive
to
him.
now
petitioner
would
ask
him
to
go
ahead
and
view
the
rest
of
the
scene,
so
the
petitioner's
constitutional
rights
would
be
protected,
views
a
little
bit,
but
they
ask
him
to
ahead
then
and
watch
more
of
this
offensive
material.
it
hasn't
been
argued
orally
today
but
it
was
called
somewhat
in
the
brief
that
the
washington
court,
both
the
lower
court
and
the
supreme
court,
were
permitted
to
consider
this
film
carmen
baby
as
the
residents
as
the
arresting
officer
outside
the
screen
or
perhaps
the
younger
children
had
without
the
soundtrack.
now
if
that's
the
way
it's
being
displayed
to
those
people
outside
the
theater,
why
should
he
quarrel
with
us
judging
it
in
that
same
vein.
if
you
don't
have
the
soundtrack,
if
you
are
displaying
it
without
a
soundtrack
then
it
should
be
judged
without
a
sound
track.
for
these
reasons
i
say
whether
or
not
social
value
is
a
part
of
an
abstract
determination
should
not
be
a
deciding
factor
in
this
case.
this
is
an
outdoor
display,
a
motion
picture
with
a
dominate
theme,
appealing
to
prurient
interest
in
sex,
a
movie
with
erotic
sexual
scenes,
respondent
urges
that
such
a
set
of
circumstances
is
amply
sufficient
within
the
guidelines
of
this
court
to
establish
the
obscenity
of
this
display.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
your
honor,
we
rely
on
those
mentioned
by
justice
mcgowan,
the
ginzburg
case,
the
michigan
case,
the
redrup
case,
and
numerous
other
decisions,
i
think
of
comparing
opinions
of
chief
justice
warren
that's
cited
in
the
brief
in
one
case
wherein
he
stated
it
was
not
the
film
that
was
on
trial,
but
the
defendant,
it's
not
the
film
but
the
manner
of
use
and
display.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
yes
your
honor,
i
think
the
kind
reliance
by
the
washington
court
of
the
opinion
was
redrup
on
assault
individual
privacy.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
our
statute
your
honor
prohibits
the
showing
of
obscene
material.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
and
i
think
this
court
your
honor,
in
all
respect,
has
also
held
that
in
certain
settings,
these
things
maybe
obscene,
whereas
they
would
not
otherwise
be
obscene
in
the
abstract.
perhaps
some
would
find
social
value
in
mr.
ginzburg's
material
and
some
social
value
in
mr.
michigan's
material
or
perhaps
if
there
was
not
an
obtrusive
display,
some
would
find
social
value
in
an
abstract
determination
for
saying
it
may
probably
pass,
but
in
the
context
of
its
use
and
exhibition,
it's
obscene
to
those
viewers.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
yes
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
yes
and
as
i
understand
that
he's
thinking
of
roth,
judging
this
beyond
in
an
abstract
setting
and
not
in
the
context
of
its
outdoor
obtrusive
display.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
no
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
we
had
at
that
time
and
we
still
have.
we
have
had
a
general
obscenity
statute.
it
has
been
changed.
the
only
material
change
is
protection
for
minors
and
juveniles.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
think
this
court
has
indicated
that
in
a
case
where
concern
of
juveniles,
you
need
a
statute
expressing
that
limited
concern,
but
i
don't
think
this
court
as
i
have
review
the
opinions
and
decisions
has
said
that
you
need
a
special
statute
to
prohibit
pandering,
that
you
need
a
special
statute
to
prohibit
what
mr.
michigan
was
doing,
or
that
you
need
a
special
statute
to
take
care
of
the
obtrusive
display
that
there
was
not
present
in
the
cases
reversed
by
redrup.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
not
an
obscenity
conviction.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
on
the
theory
that
because
of
the
contextual
segregation
--
mr.
curtis
ludwig
because
as
this
court
has
said
perhaps
in
the
recent
case
of
cohen
whatever
else
may
give
rise
to
the
state's
broader
power
to
protect
or
interfere
in
this
field,
they
must
be
in
some
way
erotic.
the
lights,
the
noise,
those
are
nuisance
matters
unless
you
--
mr.
curtis
ludwig
yes
i
presume
it
could
your
honor,
but
i
wonder
if
we
buy
and
accept
petitioner's
argument
wholeheartedly,
that
when
talking
about
a
fundamental
first
amendment
guarantee
if
he
is
right,
then
how
can
we
restrict
a
constitutional
guarantee
by
statute.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
no,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
that.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
it
may
have,
yes
your
honor.
that's
our
feeling
that
in
a
blatant
obtrusive
display
of
an
erotic
sexual
scene,
it
maybe
all
we
need
is
the
dominant
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
to
the
subject
and
i
think
the
other
cases
have
so
indicated.
perhaps
we're
here
on
a
case
of
first
impression
and
the
things
to
be
here
on
that
basis.
petitioner
here
also
quarrels
though
what
the
language
of
the
opinion
below
in
reference
to
the
display
as
offensive.
i
think
using
the
descriptive
term
offensive
does
not
depart
from
the
precedence,
it
does
not
involve
any
change
in
the
law.
the
use
of
the
term
offensive
is
simply
a
further
descriptive
word.
it
is
obscene,
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
obscenity
is
offensive
to
most
americans.
now
this
was
recognized
in
the
report
of
the
commission
on
obscenity
and
pornography,
we
cited
at
page
12
of
our
brief.
the
reply
brief
of
petitioner
points
out
that
they
maybe
didn't
cite
it
all
and
that
the
commission
also
recommended
a
particular
legislation
for
this
problem.
now
that's
very
simple
and
very
easy
to
understand.
the
report
of
the
commission
on
obscenity
and
pornography
were
simply
deemed
consistent.
they
further
recommended
removal
of
most
obscenity
statutes.
naturally,
if
we
follow
their
overall
recommendations,
then
we
wouldn't
even
have
the
general
obscenity
statute
and
we
would
have
to
legislate
a
particular
statute
to
correct
this
problem
of
offensive,
obscene
displays
which
they
recognized
and
found
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
yes
mr.
justice.
basically
this
case,
the
opinion
below
relying
on
redrup,
i
think
taking
the
overall
obscenity
picture
with
all
of
the
cases
that
we've
had
before
this
court,
this
case
recognized
the
right
of
privacy
in
a
situation
where
we
shouldn't
have
to
judge
this
film
in
the
abstract,
but
judge
it
on
its
effect
and
its
manner
of
display,
the
use
and
conduct
of
the
exhibitor.
this
case
presents
a
problem
of
protecting
the
individual's
right
of
privacy.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
it's
not
in
the
record
your
honor.
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
from
mr.
rabe
that
when
he
had
film
there
for
adults
only,
he
hired
an
off-duty
policeman
to
check
identification,
that
is
i
review
the
transcript
directly
before
the
court,
i
can't
say
whether
he
was
testifying
about
this
particular
film
or
a
previous
one.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
no
there
is
not
your
honor.
the
record
is
void
on
that.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
that's
correct.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
--
mr.
curtis
ludwig
in
my
recollection
it's
not
accurate
because
i'm
sure
the
washington
court
in
writing
this
opinion
had
statement
of
facts
before
it
and
accepted
that
as
in
the
record
(inaudible)
mr.
curtis
ludwig
81
of
the
appendix.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
yes
your
honor
because
they
were
relying
substantially
on
redrup
and
i
think
redrup
stood
for
the
proposition
that
to
protect
juveniles
who
had
to
have
a
specific
limited
statute,
whereas
the
washington
court
and
respondent
feels
that
redrup
also
stood
for
the
fact
that
you
didn't
have
to
have
such
a
statute
for
your
concern
with
the
blatant
and
obtrusive
display
that
affects
somebody
else's
privacy.
petitioner
argued
--
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
see
no
effect
one
way
or
other
is
mr.
chief
justice
if
it's
shown
outdoor
in
a
manner
where
unwilling
or
even
willing
youngsters
can
see
it,
whether
it
would
be
in
a
drive-in
seat
or
in
a
park,
whether
they
are
admitted
by
choice
or
where
they
are
able
to
see
it
free
of
charge,
i
see
no
distinction
there.
concerning
the
right
of
privacy,
petitioner
suggests
that
that's
dependent
on
statute
for
its
existence
and
cites
our
court
below
as
saying
that
we
had
not
even
recognized
a
common
law
right
of
privacy.
but
the
opinion
goes
onto
point
out
and
respondent
submits
that
the
right
of
privacy
is
as
fundamental,
a
constitutional
right
as
any
other
constitutional
right,
just
as
fundamental
as
the
right
of
free
speech.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
think
a
strict
interpretation
of
the
ninth
amendment
maybe
--
mr.
curtis
ludwig
nuisance
action
mr.
justice.
perhaps
i
think
the
state
if
they
have
a
criminal
statute
prohibiting
obscene
or
obtrusive
displays
has
a
right
to
protect
that
right
as
well
as
other
rights
for
the
people.
stanley
versus
georgia,
griswold
versus
connecticut
represent
that
right
i
think.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
understand
that
your
honor
and
i
accept
that,
but
i
think
in
answer
to
the
petitioner
we're
saying
that
it's
not
a
right
dependent
upon
statute,
i
think
it's
a
constitutional
right
and
a
common
law
he
was
talking
about
and
i
think
the
state
or
the
sovereign
state
of
washington
owes
the
protection
of
those
constitutional
rights.
in
effect
what
it
seems
to
me
is
a
balancing
of
rights,
a
balancing
of
the
individual's
right
of
privacy,
to
home
owner's
right
of
privacy
against
the
producer
of
the
motion
pictures,
fundamental
right
of
free
expression,
a
right
of
privacy
is
just
as
sacred
to
the
homeowner
as
the
right
of
free
expression
is
to
the
producer
and
interestingly
i
think
this
case
can
be
decided
by
recognizing
that
right
of
privacy,
protecting
the
home
owner's
right
of
privacy
without
denying
or
discouraging
the
movie
maker's
right
to
produce
and
display
what
he
wishes.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
that
home
owner's
right
of
privacy
is
to
be
free
from
obscene,
erotic
sexual
scene.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
from
the
state's
general
obscenity
statute
and
from
the
case
of
roth
which
says
obscenity
is
not
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
we
have
a
general
--
mr.
curtis
ludwig
our
general
obscenity
statute
your
honor
is
an
old
statute,
it's
not
new.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
think
it
may
--
we
have
amended
it
now
to
protect
juvenile.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
your
honor,
i
think
the
general
obscenity
statute
is
sufficient
mr.
dwyer
has
been
kind
enough
to
tell
me
that
our
general
obscenity
statute
is
dated
perhaps
1909,
but
other
people
have
been
convicted
under
general
obscenity
statues
with
guidelines
and
decisions
from
this
court.
i
think
that
general
obscenity
statue
is
neither
vague
nor
over
broad,
applied
to
an
obtrusive
display
of
a
motion
picture,
hoisted
up
on
residents,
if
the
dominate
theme
of
that
material
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest
in
sex.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
noise
and
light
is
other
than
erotic
sexual
scenes
and
i
go
back
to
cohen
v.
california
where
the
exact
words
escape
me,
but
whatever
else
may
give
rise
to
the
state's
broader
part
to
regulate
and
prescribe
this
type
of
conduct,
it
must
be
in
some
way
erotic
and
this
is
erotic.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
petitioner
says
that
it
is
a
vague
applied
as
an
ex
post
facto
decision
that
there
are
no
guidelines.
clearly,
it's
no
more
an
ex
post
facto
or
retroactive
decision
in
this
court's
opinion
was
in
roth
when
it
judicially
defined
obscenity
as
material
dealing
with
a
prurient
or
dominate
theme
appealing
to
the
prurient
interest
in
sex.
as
to
guidelines
of
fair
notice,
the
statute
gives
the
notice
when
it
prescribes
obscenity.
the
previous
rules
of
the
court
set
the
standards
and
convey
sufficient
warnings.
i
have
said
in
the
brief
it
perhaps
the
rating
maybe
the
standards
and
that
is
not
accurate
and
as
an
afterthought
i
see
that,
that
isn't
precise
legal
guideline.
a
guideline
should
be
whether
the
dominant
theme
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest
in
sex
and
the
x-rating
perhaps
as
a
practical
matter
be
some
further
value
or
notice
to
the
exhibitor
that
it
very
well
may
have
a
dominant
theme
which
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
your
honor
i
think
perhaps
it
could
have.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
but
we
had
since
the
prosecution
commenced
amended
the
statute.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
didn't
express
the
limited
concern
for
juveniles
as
was
suggested
by
redrup
and
redrup
was
a
case
that
they
were
relying
on.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
well,
as
i
read
redrup
it
did
not
require
a
special
statutory
concern.
it
merely
said,
in
none
of
the
cases
was
there
a
claim
that
the
statue
in
question
reflected
a
specific
and
limited
state
concern
for
juvenile.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
no,
i
do
your
honor.
i
think
they
relied
on
redrup
for
this
reason
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
and
none
was
there
any
suggestion
of
an
assault
upon
individual
privacy
by
publication
in
a
manner
so
obtrusive
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
an
unwilling
individual
to
avoid
exposure
to
it.
on
one
situation
it
required
a
statue,
on
the
other
our
court
feel
it
did
not.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
am
not
familiar
with
cohen.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
think
we
do
give
fair
notice
by
our
statute
prescribing
obscenity
and
then
defining
obscenity
as
material
dealing
with
a
--
having
a
dominant
theme
appealing
to
the
prurient
interest
and
then
saying
that
other
things
are
relevant
in
the
determination
of
that
obscenity.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
know
the
statue
is
a
general
obscenity
status
your
honor.
in
just
a
moment
left
and
the
most
part
of
this
case
as
it
appeals
to
a
prosecutor
and
of
most
concern
to
law
enforcement
agency
involves
a
procedure
for
seizure
of
evidence.
this
court's
cases
of
marcus
and
a
quantity
of
books
and
lee
art
theatre,
are
the
only
cases
i
think
on
point
of
seizure
of
this
type
of
material.
they
are
all
logical
and
clear.
they
present
no
problem.
they
are
cases
which
were
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
nature
and
the
purpose
of
the
seizure.
lee
art
theatre
was
a
case
of
seizure
for
evidence
and
does
not
support
the
proposition
that
a
prior
advisory
hearing
is
necessary,
only
that
a
warrant
or
seizure
requires
more
than
a
conclusory
affidavit
of
an
officer.
the
confusion
seems
to
arise
in
the
lower
courts
from
the
failure
to
recognize
a
basic
distinction,
a
distinction
between
seizure
and
its
suppression
as
marcus
and
the
quantity
of
books
and
seizure
aimed
at
securing
evidence.
(inaudible)
decided
in
1968
prior
to
lee
art
theatre
seems
to
appreciate
the
distinction.
interestingly
enough
that
was
the
first
circuit
court
case
on
this
point
and
it
said
a
prior
advisory
hearing,
but
that
was
a
case
where
they
had
seized
four
copies
of
a
film,
the
same
film
for
prosecution
and
they
said
you
can't
do
that.
four
copies
as
distinguished
from
one
for
evidence
is
quite
a
distinction.
the
court
ordered
them
to
deliver
that
one
and
from
there
on
other
courts
have
followed
that,
other
courts
have
suggested
other
alternatives.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
your
honor
i
think
lee
art
theater
said
that
it
should
be
made
on
a
judicial
determination
designed
to
focus
searchingly
on
the
question
obscenity
as
the
marcus.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
motion
picture
carmen
baby
is
played
on
a
large
outdoor
screen
is
obscene.
its
dominate
theme
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest
in
sex
and
the
court
below
has
so
held.
now
considering
the
use
and
the
manner
of
display,
the
washington
state
supreme
court
following
a
careful
review
to
decisions
of
this
court
properly
and
justifiably
found
this
movie
obscene.
the
washington
state
court
--
mr.
curtis
ludwig
no,
there
haven't
mr.
justice
douglas,
none
at
all
in
my
jurisdiction
regarding
this
movie
or
any
other
to
my
knowledge.
you
asked
earlier
about
the
standard
in
washington
regarding
punishment
or
penalties
in
general.
i
know
of
no
other
reported
cases
concerning
obscenity,
sustaining
of
conviction
in
our
jurisdiction
other
than
state
versus
rabe.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
think
mr.
justice
–
formerly
justice
mcgowan's
opinion
was
probably
the
best
written
brief
submitted
more
or
less
to
this
court
in
a
way.
what
he
said
was
that
the
dominant
theme
of
that
movie
appealed
to
the
prurient
interest
in
sex
and
in
the
context
of
its
display,
it
was
obscene.
that
court
and
in
their
opinion
indicated
that
we
are
obviously
not
judging
the
obscenity
in
the
abstract.
the
declaration
of
obscenity
was
aided
by
a
specific
set
of
circumstances,
involving
outdoor
display
of
a
movie
which
the
opinion
says
had
a
dominant
theme
appealing
to
the
prurient
interest.
now,
i
like
to
distinguish
this.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
yes
your
honor,
i
am
aware
of
that
and
i
was
going
to
try
and
lead
into
how
i
feel
he
interpreted
that
or
how
i
interpret
that.
as
i
said
–
indicate,
i
would
like
to
make
a
distinction
between
state
of
washington
versus
rabe
and
the
opinion
in
the
court
below
and
this
court's
opinion
in
a
book
versus
attorney
general.
as
i
said
i
have
done
page
9
of
our
brief
a
short
exert
from
that
opinion.
it
was
expressly
indicated
by
mr.
justice
brennan
that
that
material
was
judged
in
the
abstract
and
that
it
was
expressly
pointed
out
at
circumstances
of
production,
sale
and
publicity
are
relevant
to
a
determination
of
obscenity.
petitioner
here
has
continually
referred
to
the
the
film
as
non-obscene,
that's
the
language
of
this
brief,
that's
his
comments
to
the
court
today.
he
suggests
in
his
reply
brief
on
page
one
and
he
suggested
to
your
honors
today,
that
we
practically
concede
that
non-obscenity.
on
the
contrary
the
respondent
urges
and
the
court
below
determined
that
it
is
in
fact
obscene.
petitioner's
conviction
under
the
state's
obscenity
statute
rests
solely
on
that
determination.
now
what
the
court
below
and
what
justice
mcgowan
said
in
his
opinion
was
simply
that
in
an
abstract
determination
the
film
would
probably
pass
the
roth-memoirs
definition
of
obscenity.
opinion
below
suggests
in
paraphrasing
that
some
might
find
it
not
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value,
but
in
the
context
of
its
display,
in
the
outdoor
theater,
hoisted
up
on
the
nearby
residency,
it
was
in
fact
obscene.
in
that
particular
regard
i
have
noted,
would
interest
the
morality
amicus
curiae
brief
which
urges
that
the
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
is
not
part
of
the
test
for
obscenity
established
by
roth
and
we
need
not
reach
that
issue
here.
in
my
view,
whether
social
value
is
or
is
not
or
privately
test,
should
be
important
only
in
an
abstract
determination
of
obscenity.
i
say
that
because
assuming
that
morality
is
wrong
in
their
amicus
brief
and
assuming
that
other
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
is
a
part
of
the
test
and
assuming
for
the
moment
that
carmen
baby
has
some
redeeming
social
value.
that
social
value
is
certainly
going
to
be
lost
or
obscured
to
those
unwilling
viewers
of
this
outdoor
display.
now
petitioner
rabe
completely
overlooks
that
fact
and
he
suggests
in
his
brief
on
page
20
that
if
the
householder
took
time
to
watch
the
entire
film,
it
would
presumably
be
restored
to
constitutional
protection.
now
that's
really
a
novel
unique
idea.
picture
if
you
will,
a
home
owner
who
views
an
erotic
scene,
very
offensive
to
him.
now
petitioner
would
ask
him
to
go
ahead
and
view
the
rest
of
the
scene,
so
the
petitioner's
constitutional
rights
would
be
protected,
views
a
little
bit,
but
they
ask
him
to
ahead
then
and
watch
more
of
this
offensive
material.
it
hasn't
been
argued
orally
today
but
it
was
called
somewhat
in
the
brief
that
the
washington
court,
both
the
lower
court
and
the
supreme
court,
were
permitted
to
consider
this
film
carmen
baby
as
the
residents
as
the
arresting
officer
outside
the
screen
or
perhaps
the
younger
children
had
without
the
soundtrack.
now
if
that's
the
way
it's
being
displayed
to
those
people
outside
the
theater,
why
should
he
quarrel
with
us
judging
it
in
that
same
vein.
if
you
don't
have
the
soundtrack,
if
you
are
displaying
it
without
a
soundtrack
then
it
should
be
judged
without
a
sound
track.
for
these
reasons
i
say
whether
or
not
social
value
is
a
part
of
an
abstract
determination
should
not
be
a
deciding
factor
in
this
case.
this
is
an
outdoor
display,
a
motion
picture
with
a
dominate
theme,
appealing
to
prurient
interest
in
sex,
a
movie
with
erotic
sexual
scenes,
respondent
urges
that
such
a
set
of
circumstances
is
amply
sufficient
within
the
guidelines
of
this
court
to
establish
the
obscenity
of
this
display.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
your
honor,
we
rely
on
those
mentioned
by
justice
mcgowan,
the
ginzburg
case,
the
michigan
case,
the
redrup
case,
and
numerous
other
decisions,
i
think
of
comparing
opinions
of
chief
justice
warren
that's
cited
in
the
brief
in
one
case
wherein
he
stated
it
was
not
the
film
that
was
on
trial,
but
the
defendant,
it's
not
the
film
but
the
manner
of
use
and
display.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
yes
your
honor,
i
think
the
kind
reliance
by
the
washington
court
of
the
opinion
was
redrup
on
assault
individual
privacy.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
our
statute
your
honor
prohibits
the
showing
of
obscene
material.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
and
i
think
this
court
your
honor,
in
all
respect,
has
also
held
that
in
certain
settings,
these
things
maybe
obscene,
whereas
they
would
not
otherwise
be
obscene
in
the
abstract.
perhaps
some
would
find
social
value
in
mr.
ginzburg's
material
and
some
social
value
in
mr.
michigan's
material
or
perhaps
if
there
was
not
an
obtrusive
display,
some
would
find
social
value
in
an
abstract
determination
for
saying
it
may
probably
pass,
but
in
the
context
of
its
use
and
exhibition,
it's
obscene
to
those
viewers.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
yes
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
yes
and
as
i
understand
that
he's
thinking
of
roth,
judging
this
beyond
in
an
abstract
setting
and
not
in
the
context
of
its
outdoor
obtrusive
display.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
no
your
honor.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
we
had
at
that
time
and
we
still
have.
we
have
had
a
general
obscenity
statute.
it
has
been
changed.
the
only
material
change
is
protection
for
minors
and
juveniles.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
think
this
court
has
indicated
that
in
a
case
where
concern
of
juveniles,
you
need
a
statute
expressing
that
limited
concern,
but
i
don't
think
this
court
as
i
have
review
the
opinions
and
decisions
has
said
that
you
need
a
special
statute
to
prohibit
pandering,
that
you
need
a
special
statute
to
prohibit
what
mr.
michigan
was
doing,
or
that
you
need
a
special
statute
to
take
care
of
the
obtrusive
display
that
there
was
not
present
in
the
cases
reversed
by
redrup.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
not
an
obscenity
conviction.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
on
the
theory
that
because
of
the
contextual
segregation
--
mr.
curtis
ludwig
because
as
this
court
has
said
perhaps
in
the
recent
case
of
cohen
whatever
else
may
give
rise
to
the
state's
broader
power
to
protect
or
interfere
in
this
field,
they
must
be
in
some
way
erotic.
the
lights,
the
noise,
those
are
nuisance
matters
unless
you
--
mr.
curtis
ludwig
yes
i
presume
it
could
your
honor,
but
i
wonder
if
we
buy
and
accept
petitioner's
argument
wholeheartedly,
that
when
talking
about
a
fundamental
first
amendment
guarantee
if
he
is
right,
then
how
can
we
restrict
a
constitutional
guarantee
by
statute.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
no,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
that.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
it
may
have,
yes
your
honor.
that's
our
feeling
that
in
a
blatant
obtrusive
display
of
an
erotic
sexual
scene,
it
maybe
all
we
need
is
the
dominant
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
to
the
subject
and
i
think
the
other
cases
have
so
indicated.
perhaps
we're
here
on
a
case
of
first
impression
and
the
things
to
be
here
on
that
basis.
petitioner
here
also
quarrels
though
what
the
language
of
the
opinion
below
in
reference
to
the
display
as
offensive.
i
think
using
the
descriptive
term
offensive
does
not
depart
from
the
precedence,
it
does
not
involve
any
change
in
the
law.
the
use
of
the
term
offensive
is
simply
a
further
descriptive
word.
it
is
obscene,
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
obscenity
is
offensive
to
most
americans.
now
this
was
recognized
in
the
report
of
the
commission
on
obscenity
and
pornography,
we
cited
at
page
12
of
our
brief.
the
reply
brief
of
petitioner
points
out
that
they
maybe
didn't
cite
it
all
and
that
the
commission
also
recommended
a
particular
legislation
for
this
problem.
now
that's
very
simple
and
very
easy
to
understand.
the
report
of
the
commission
on
obscenity
and
pornography
were
simply
deemed
consistent.
they
further
recommended
removal
of
most
obscenity
statutes.
naturally,
if
we
follow
their
overall
recommendations,
then
we
wouldn't
even
have
the
general
obscenity
statute
and
we
would
have
to
legislate
a
particular
statute
to
correct
this
problem
of
offensive,
obscene
displays
which
they
recognized
and
found
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
yes
mr.
justice.
basically
this
case,
the
opinion
below
relying
on
redrup,
i
think
taking
the
overall
obscenity
picture
with
all
of
the
cases
that
we've
had
before
this
court,
this
case
recognized
the
right
of
privacy
in
a
situation
where
we
shouldn't
have
to
judge
this
film
in
the
abstract,
but
judge
it
on
its
effect
and
its
manner
of
display,
the
use
and
conduct
of
the
exhibitor.
this
case
presents
a
problem
of
protecting
the
individual's
right
of
privacy.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
it's
not
in
the
record
your
honor.
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
from
mr.
rabe
that
when
he
had
film
there
for
adults
only,
he
hired
an
off-duty
policeman
to
check
identification,
that
is
i
review
the
transcript
directly
before
the
court,
i
can't
say
whether
he
was
testifying
about
this
particular
film
or
a
previous
one.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
no
there
is
not
your
honor.
the
record
is
void
on
that.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
that's
correct.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
--
mr.
curtis
ludwig
in
my
recollection
it's
not
accurate
because
i'm
sure
the
washington
court
in
writing
this
opinion
had
statement
of
facts
before
it
and
accepted
that
as
in
the
record
(inaudible)
mr.
curtis
ludwig
81
of
the
appendix.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
yes
your
honor
because
they
were
relying
substantially
on
redrup
and
i
think
redrup
stood
for
the
proposition
that
to
protect
juveniles
who
had
to
have
a
specific
limited
statute,
whereas
the
washington
court
and
respondent
feels
that
redrup
also
stood
for
the
fact
that
you
didn't
have
to
have
such
a
statute
for
your
concern
with
the
blatant
and
obtrusive
display
that
affects
somebody
else's
privacy.
petitioner
argued
--
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
see
no
effect
one
way
or
other
is
mr.
chief
justice
if
it's
shown
outdoor
in
a
manner
where
unwilling
or
even
willing
youngsters
can
see
it,
whether
it
would
be
in
a
drive-in
seat
or
in
a
park,
whether
they
are
admitted
by
choice
or
where
they
are
able
to
see
it
free
of
charge,
i
see
no
distinction
there.
concerning
the
right
of
privacy,
petitioner
suggests
that
that's
dependent
on
statute
for
its
existence
and
cites
our
court
below
as
saying
that
we
had
not
even
recognized
a
common
law
right
of
privacy.
but
the
opinion
goes
onto
point
out
and
respondent
submits
that
the
right
of
privacy
is
as
fundamental,
a
constitutional
right
as
any
other
constitutional
right,
just
as
fundamental
as
the
right
of
free
speech.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
think
a
strict
interpretation
of
the
ninth
amendment
maybe
--
mr.
curtis
ludwig
nuisance
action
mr.
justice.
perhaps
i
think
the
state
if
they
have
a
criminal
statute
prohibiting
obscene
or
obtrusive
displays
has
a
right
to
protect
that
right
as
well
as
other
rights
for
the
people.
stanley
versus
georgia,
griswold
versus
connecticut
represent
that
right
i
think.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
understand
that
your
honor
and
i
accept
that,
but
i
think
in
answer
to
the
petitioner
we're
saying
that
it's
not
a
right
dependent
upon
statute,
i
think
it's
a
constitutional
right
and
a
common
law
he
was
talking
about
and
i
think
the
state
or
the
sovereign
state
of
washington
owes
the
protection
of
those
constitutional
rights.
in
effect
what
it
seems
to
me
is
a
balancing
of
rights,
a
balancing
of
the
individual's
right
of
privacy,
to
home
owner's
right
of
privacy
against
the
producer
of
the
motion
pictures,
fundamental
right
of
free
expression,
a
right
of
privacy
is
just
as
sacred
to
the
homeowner
as
the
right
of
free
expression
is
to
the
producer
and
interestingly
i
think
this
case
can
be
decided
by
recognizing
that
right
of
privacy,
protecting
the
home
owner's
right
of
privacy
without
denying
or
discouraging
the
movie
maker's
right
to
produce
and
display
what
he
wishes.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
that
home
owner's
right
of
privacy
is
to
be
free
from
obscene,
erotic
sexual
scene.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
from
the
state's
general
obscenity
statute
and
from
the
case
of
roth
which
says
obscenity
is
not
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
we
have
a
general
--
mr.
curtis
ludwig
our
general
obscenity
statute
your
honor
is
an
old
statute,
it's
not
new.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
think
it
may
--
we
have
amended
it
now
to
protect
juvenile.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
your
honor,
i
think
the
general
obscenity
statute
is
sufficient
mr.
dwyer
has
been
kind
enough
to
tell
me
that
our
general
obscenity
statute
is
dated
perhaps
1909,
but
other
people
have
been
convicted
under
general
obscenity
statues
with
guidelines
and
decisions
from
this
court.
i
think
that
general
obscenity
statue
is
neither
vague
nor
over
broad,
applied
to
an
obtrusive
display
of
a
motion
picture,
hoisted
up
on
residents,
if
the
dominate
theme
of
that
material
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest
in
sex.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
noise
and
light
is
other
than
erotic
sexual
scenes
and
i
go
back
to
cohen
v.
california
where
the
exact
words
escape
me,
but
whatever
else
may
give
rise
to
the
state's
broader
part
to
regulate
and
prescribe
this
type
of
conduct,
it
must
be
in
some
way
erotic
and
this
is
erotic.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
petitioner
says
that
it
is
a
vague
applied
as
an
ex
post
facto
decision
that
there
are
no
guidelines.
clearly,
it's
no
more
an
ex
post
facto
or
retroactive
decision
in
this
court's
opinion
was
in
roth
when
it
judicially
defined
obscenity
as
material
dealing
with
a
prurient
or
dominate
theme
appealing
to
the
prurient
interest
in
sex.
as
to
guidelines
of
fair
notice,
the
statute
gives
the
notice
when
it
prescribes
obscenity.
the
previous
rules
of
the
court
set
the
standards
and
convey
sufficient
warnings.
i
have
said
in
the
brief
it
perhaps
the
rating
maybe
the
standards
and
that
is
not
accurate
and
as
an
afterthought
i
see
that,
that
isn't
precise
legal
guideline.
a
guideline
should
be
whether
the
dominant
theme
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest
in
sex
and
the
x-rating
perhaps
as
a
practical
matter
be
some
further
value
or
notice
to
the
exhibitor
that
it
very
well
may
have
a
dominant
theme
which
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
your
honor
i
think
perhaps
it
could
have.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
but
we
had
since
the
prosecution
commenced
amended
the
statute.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
didn't
express
the
limited
concern
for
juveniles
as
was
suggested
by
redrup
and
redrup
was
a
case
that
they
were
relying
on.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
well,
as
i
read
redrup
it
did
not
require
a
special
statutory
concern.
it
merely
said,
in
none
of
the
cases
was
there
a
claim
that
the
statue
in
question
reflected
a
specific
and
limited
state
concern
for
juvenile.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
no,
i
do
your
honor.
i
think
they
relied
on
redrup
for
this
reason
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
and
none
was
there
any
suggestion
of
an
assault
upon
individual
privacy
by
publication
in
a
manner
so
obtrusive
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
an
unwilling
individual
to
avoid
exposure
to
it.
on
one
situation
it
required
a
statue,
on
the
other
our
court
feel
it
did
not.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
am
not
familiar
with
cohen.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
think
we
do
give
fair
notice
by
our
statute
prescribing
obscenity
and
then
defining
obscenity
as
material
dealing
with
a
--
having
a
dominant
theme
appealing
to
the
prurient
interest
and
then
saying
that
other
things
are
relevant
in
the
determination
of
that
obscenity.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
i
know
the
statue
is
a
general
obscenity
status
your
honor.
in
just
a
moment
left
and
the
most
part
of
this
case
as
it
appeals
to
a
prosecutor
and
of
most
concern
to
law
enforcement
agency
involves
a
procedure
for
seizure
of
evidence.
this
court's
cases
of
marcus
and
a
quantity
of
books
and
lee
art
theatre,
are
the
only
cases
i
think
on
point
of
seizure
of
this
type
of
material.
they
are
all
logical
and
clear.
they
present
no
problem.
they
are
cases
which
were
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
nature
and
the
purpose
of
the
seizure.
lee
art
theatre
was
a
case
of
seizure
for
evidence
and
does
not
support
the
proposition
that
a
prior
advisory
hearing
is
necessary,
only
that
a
warrant
or
seizure
requires
more
than
a
conclusory
affidavit
of
an
officer.
the
confusion
seems
to
arise
in
the
lower
courts
from
the
failure
to
recognize
a
basic
distinction,
a
distinction
between
seizure
and
its
suppression
as
marcus
and
the
quantity
of
books
and
seizure
aimed
at
securing
evidence.
(inaudible)
decided
in
1968
prior
to
lee
art
theatre
seems
to
appreciate
the
distinction.
interestingly
enough
that
was
the
first
circuit
court
case
on
this
point
and
it
said
a
prior
advisory
hearing,
but
that
was
a
case
where
they
had
seized
four
copies
of
a
film,
the
same
film
for
prosecution
and
they
said
you
can't
do
that.
four
copies
as
distinguished
from
one
for
evidence
is
quite
a
distinction.
the
court
ordered
them
to
deliver
that
one
and
from
there
on
other
courts
have
followed
that,
other
courts
have
suggested
other
alternatives.
mr.
curtis
ludwig
your
honor
i
think
lee
art
theater
said
that
it
should
be
made
on
a
judicial
determination
designed
to
focus
searchingly
on
the
question
obscenity
as
the
marcus.
