justice
potter
stewart
and
this
motion
picture
was
based
on
the
opera
carmen,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
called
carmen
baby?
justice
potter
stewart
this
movie
was
shown
without
incident
in
other
states
--
in
your
state,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
public
theaters.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
been
shown
pretty
well
all
over
the
united
states,
hasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
public
theaters,
reviewed
in
the
newspapers.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
a
fact
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
can
be
suppressed
under
the
constitution,
and
that's
been
decided
in
two
other
courts,
has
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
involved
the
movie?
justice
potter
stewart
some
states
have
the
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
don't
need
to
go
that
far
however
here.
there
was
no
such
statute
of
any
kind,
that's
your
point
here?
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
whether
how
much
power
the
state
might
have
under
the
police
power
to
require
drive-in
to
be
so
many
feet
away
from
any
residences
or
to
put
up
passes
so
that
the
light
and
the
noise
and
the
traffic
wouldn't
bother
people
or
this
content
of
the
movie
wouldn't
bother
people.
those
are
all
questions
that
arise
if
there
were
any
such
statute
here.
here
there
is
simply
no
such
statute
of
any
kind,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
dwyer
since
we
are
talking
about
a
statute
that
doesn't
exist,
i
don't
see
why
you
have
to
take
any
position
in
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
what
it
could
constitutionally
provide.
your
point
is
there
is
no
such
statute
of
any
kind,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
need
to
--
it's
very
possible
that
a
state
could
provide
that
nobody
should
have
a
drive-in
theater
within
a
200
yards
of
any
residence,
but
there
is
no
statute
of
any
kind
in
this
case,
that's
you
point,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
search
warrant
at
all
here,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
an
arrest
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
search
was
incident
to
the
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
so
the
arrest
was
valid,
you
say
the
search
would
still
be
invalid,
searches
in
the
first
amendment
area?
justice
potter
stewart
that
we
should
not
apply
ordinary
fourth
amendment
law?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
a
policeman
in
he
street
in
new
york
city
walks
in
the
store,
and
sees
--
he
is
an
eye
witness
to
the
sale
by
the
proprietor
of
the
hardest
imaginable
core
kind
of
pornography.
couldn't
he
just
arrest
that
person
on
the
spot
assuming
that
new
york
has
a
valid
criminal
statute
covering
that
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
am
assuming
it's
your
idea
as
to
the
worst
possible
thing
you
can
imagine?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
court
said,
that
the
judge
mcgowan's
in
his
opinion
at
least
said
that
if
we
were
to
apply
strict
rules
of
roth,
the
film
carmen
baby
probably
would
pass
the
definition
of
obscenity
test?
justice
potter
stewart
what
decisions
of
this
court
do
you
rely
on?
justice
potter
stewart
now
here
there
was
no
claim
on
your
part
as
i
understand,
and
no
evidence
that
there
was
anything
like
the
so-called
pandering
that
the
court
found
in
ginzburg,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
statute
doesn't
prohibit
that?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
right
and
you
have
indicated
that
this
movie
had
one
of
what
this
court
has
held
are
the
three
requisite
elements?
justice
potter
stewart
you
may
think
so,
but
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
mcgowan,
judge
mcgowan
he
didn't.
he
said
there
was
one
of
the
elements,
but
on
the
record,
it's
on
page
9
in
appendix.
justice
potter
stewart
he
said
this
doesn't
meet
the
criteria
of
roth,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don't
have
any
statute
or
arguments
that
talks
about
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
outdoor
obtrusive
display?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
assume
that
this
was
--
and
i
haven't
seen
any
movies
lately,
but
goldilocks
and
the
three
bears
and
that
the
light
and
the
noise
and
the
traffic
bothered
householders,
that
the
showing
of
the
movie
bothered
the
nearby
householders.
could
you
get
a
conviction
under
this
ordinance?
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
did
with
this
movie
which
your
court
has
found
is
not
obscene?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
bothered
the
nearby
residents
say
or
potentially
a
minor?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
presume
that
your
state
could
legislate
against
those
nuisance
matters,
could
it
not
--?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
that
he
has
any
claim
here
as
a
constitutional
guarantee
to
show
a
bright
light
on
somebody's
window
or
to
make
a
lot
of
noise
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
conviction
was
under
968.0102,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
and
then
on
page
96
and
97,
the
same
opinion
of
the
court
explicitly
refused
and
found
it
impossible
to
ground
its
decision
on
the
fact
that
this
film
was
exhibited
to
minor,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
constitutional
right
of
privacy
is
assertable
only
against
government,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
constitution,
about
all
constitution,
the
right
of
privacy
if
it
is
a
constitutional
right,
if
suppose
it's
a
constitutional
right,
is
assertable
only
against
government,
state
or
federal.
any
other
right
of
privacy
is
a
matter
of
tort
law,
is
it
not,
against
private
relation
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
a
right
against
intrusion
by
government,
that's
a
constitutional
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well
why
would
the
motion
picture
have
to
have
that
dominate
theme?
if
there
was
a
motion
picture,
that
noise
and
light
of
which
bothered
householders,
why
couldn't
you
convict
somebody
under
the
statute
for
that
kind
of
an
invasion
of
privacy
because
it
has
been
found
that
this
movie
is
not
obscene
in
a
constitutional
sense?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
guess
you
have
stanley
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
redrup
--
quite
apart
from
redrup
what
do
you
think
about
ordinary
due
process
of
law,
cohen
against
arkansas?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
variety
of
cases
that
say
that
a
criminal
statute
has
to
give
fair
notice
both
to
the
citizenry
and
to
the
law
enforcement
officers
and
to
the
judges
as
to
why
it
is
that's
illegal.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
read
your
statue,
it
doesn't
say
any
of
those
things.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
motion
picture
was
based
on
the
opera
carmen,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
called
carmen
baby?
justice
potter
stewart
this
movie
was
shown
without
incident
in
other
states
--
in
your
state,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
public
theaters.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
been
shown
pretty
well
all
over
the
united
states,
hasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
public
theaters,
reviewed
in
the
newspapers.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
a
fact
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
can
be
suppressed
under
the
constitution,
and
that's
been
decided
in
two
other
courts,
has
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
involved
the
movie?
justice
potter
stewart
some
states
have
the
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
don't
need
to
go
that
far
however
here.
there
was
no
such
statute
of
any
kind,
that's
your
point
here?
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
whether
how
much
power
the
state
might
have
under
the
police
power
to
require
drive-in
to
be
so
many
feet

the

those
are
all
questions
that
arise
if
there
were
any
such
statute
here.
here
there
is
simply
no
such
statute
of
any

isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
dwyer
since
we
are
talking
about
a
statute
that
doesn't

i
don't
see
why
you
have
to
take
any

in

the

as
to
what
it
could
constitutionally
provide.
your
point
is
there
is
no
such
statute
of
any
kind,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
need
to
--
it's
very
possible
that
a
state
could
provide
that
nobody
should
have
a
drive-in
theater
within
a
200
yards
of
any

but
there
is
no
statute
of
any

in
this

that's

there
was
no

at

it
was
an
arrest

justice
potter
stewart
and
the
search
was
incident
to
the
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
so
the
arrest
was
valid,
you
say
the
search
would
still
be
invalid,
searches
in
the
first
amendment
area?
justice
potter
stewart
that
we
should
not
apply
ordinary
fourth
