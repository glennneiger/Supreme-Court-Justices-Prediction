mr.
william
l.
dwyer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
courts
of
the
state
of
washington
have
declared
themselves
to
be
not
bound
by
this
court's
constitutional
definition
of
obscenity
and
they
have
thrust
to
decide
to
publish
a
man
criminally
for
exhibiting
a
motion
picture
which
is
clearly
non-obscene
and
is
protected
under
the
first
amendment
guarantee
of
freedom
of
expression.
in
the
course
of
doing
this,
the
courts
of
the
state
of
washington
have
welded
a
general
obscenity
statute
of
the
type
which
typically
exists
in
all
50
states
and
of
the
type
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
made
clear,
can
be
used
only
to
punish
or
suppress
material
which
is
obscene
under
the
test
promulgated
in
the
leading
case
of
roth
versus
united
states.
as
summarized
in
many
case,
since
then,
perhaps
most
explicitly
in
the
book
versus
attorney
general
of
1966,
in
order
to
convict,
the
state
must
prove
the
three
elements
(inaudible).
first,
it
must
be
established
the
predominant
theme
of
the
material
taken
as
a
whole
is
an
appeal
to
currying
an
interest
in
sex
and
not
some
other
kind
of
appeal.
second,
the
material
must
be
patently
offensive
and
affronting
the
contemporary
community
standards
of
candor
in
representing
or
depicting
sexual
matters.
third,
that
the
material
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
i
mention
those
elements
despite
their
well-known
familiarity
to
the
court
and
the
counsel
in
this
field
because
of
our
belief
that
it
is
vital,
that
this
definition
be
honored
and
adhered
to,
if
freedom
of
speech
is
to
survive
the
application
of
the
obscenity
laws
in
united
states.
if
this
definition
should
be
weakened
or
abandoned,
the
small
crack
in
the
wall
which
is
afforded
to
the
general
obscenity
laws
as
to
unprotected
speech,
will
very
quickly
become
a
wide
open
door
to
the
punishment
of
protected
expression.
in
roth,
the
court
pointed
out
that
it
was
implicit
in
the
history
of
the
first
amendment
that
obscenity
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
and
that
finding,
that
belief
is
the
basis
for
obscenity
law
as
it
exists
today.
and
the
court
has
repeatedly
made
clear,
both
in
full
scale
opinions
and
in
per
curiam
reversals
over
the
last
15
years
that
that
definition
applies
so
as
to
protect
material
which
most
people
would
find
offensive,
disgusting,
of
little
value
perhaps.
bit
the
definition
must
be
adhered
to
in
order
for
the
first
amendment
guaranteed
to
be
carried
out
in
the
actual
day-to-day
enforcement
of
the
laws.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
$600
fine
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
he
was
not
sentenced
to
prison
at
all,
just
a
fine.
the
sentencing
judge
remark
to,
however,
that
he
was
fixing
the
fine
at
a
level
he
considered
high
enough
to
prevent
such
display
of
motion
pictures
from
happening
again
in
that
community.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
is
based
on
the
verbatim
of
carmen
without
the
music.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
carmen
baby.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
it
did.
as
several
witnesses
testified
the
trial,
the
story,
follows
the
story
line
of
opera
carmen,
which
in
turns
follow
a
novel
by
mérimée,
a
french
novelist.
the
character
of
carmen
is
very
similar,
an
evil,
young
woman
fatalistically
headed
toward
her
own
destruction.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
in
a
few
cases,
there
have
been
prison
sentences
in
the
neighborhood
of
30
days
as
i
recall
most
recently
in
seattle.
in
motion
picture
prosecutions,
prison
sentences
have
only
been
meted
out
in
the
type
of
film
that's
shown
in
places
called
the
adult
bookstore
for
example,
which
specializes
in
erotic
materials.
in
exhibitions
for
general
consumption
such
as
the
present
case,
fines
have
been
usually
penalty
imposed.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
it
was
indeed,
it
was
shown
in
seattle,
and
it
was
shown
in
yakima,
which
is
not
far
from
richland.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
in
public
theaters.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
it
has,
it's
been
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
reviewed
in
the
new
york
times.
one
witness
testified
in
the
court
below
that
he
saw
it
shown
at
oak
ridge,
tennessee
in
a
situation
where
it
was
shown
in
an
outdoor
screen
and
the
sound
was
piped
into
the
motel
for
those
wishing
to
listen.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
it
was
decided
in
new
jersey
and
in
maryland
i
believe
and
the
opinion
in
new
jersey
i
think
is
very
eloquent.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
no,
in
neither
state,
mr.
justice
marshall,
they
did
involve
drive-in.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
it
involved
the
same
movie,
but
shown
at
an
indoor
theater.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
the
photographs
in
the
record
show
that
there
are
a
few
depleted
houses
at
some
distance
from
the
screen,
some
of
which
would
be
able
to
have
the
view.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
there
was
nothing
to
stop
anyone
of
any
age
for
standing
at
the
fence
and
looking,
that
there
is
a
physical
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
i
am
sorry.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes,
i
do.
i
think
the
state
could
probably
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes,
i
think,
the
state
could
properly
legislate
in
that
area
what
has
been
called
the
area
of
obtrusive
display
legislation.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes,
indeed
it
has
and
why
the
states
have
not
more
clearly
picked
up
that
opportunity
and
acted
upon
it
before
how,
i
don't
know.
what
you
have,
we
have
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
new
york
has,
arizona
has,
but
i
think
it's
still
a
minority
of
states
that
have.
our
state
could
and
should,
but
hasn't
and
that's
the
fatal
defect
in
the
present
prosecution.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
there
was
nothing
shown
in
the
record
here
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
there
was,
in
fact,
any
exposure
to
people
outside
the
drive-in.
there
was
no
evidence
that
anybody
outside
the
drive-in,
saw
that
film
or
complained
about
it,
or
was
affected
by
it
in
many
ways.
but
we
do
concede
and
i
think
there
is
no
contest
that
a
state
can
legislate
in
the
obtrusive
display
area
by
enacting
a
clearly,
narrowly,
specifically
drawn
statute
which
could
apply
to
the
drive-in
motion
picture
theaters
as
well
as
billboards,
news
stands
and
other
types
of
displays.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes,
i
believe
such
legislation
could
be
enacted
and
in
the
report
of
the
president's
commission
on
obscenity
and
pornography,
there
is
even
a
model
statute
to
that
effect.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
that
is
one
of
our
basic
complaints,
yes,
indeed
it
is
because
nothing
in
the
statute
gave
mr.
rabe
any
notice
that
he
could
be
prosecuted
on
any
theory
for
showing
a
non-obscene
film
under
certain
circumstances
such
as
an
outdoor
exhibition.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
that's
not
our
only
position.
we
further
contend
that
in
expanding
the
obscenity
statute
as
it
did
so
as
to
sweep
this
picture
within
its
ambit,
the
washington
supreme
court
has
rendered
that
obscenity
statute
void
for
vagueness
in
the
application
because
it
has
punished
the
exhibition
of
the
film
on
the
ground
of
offensiveness
or
obtrusiveness,
words
which
recur
throughout
the
opinion
with
no
definition,
no
substantive
standard
whatever
to
guide
either
this
defendant
or
any
other
exhibitor
in
the
future
as
to
what
he
could
or
could
not
exhibit
in
an
outdoor
theater.
the
prime
danger
of
the
many
dangers
we
see
in
the
washington
opinion
is
that
the
court
there
expressly
says
that
even
though
it
is
enforcing
a
general
obscenity
statute,
it
does
not
have
to
be
guided
by
the
roth
definition
of
obscenity.
that
we
believe
cries
out
more
than
any
other
single
element
in
the
case
for
a
reversal.
the
court
in
our
view
has
misread
this
court's
decisions
in
ginzburg,
michigan
and
redrup
and
has
engrafted
an
ill-defined
or
completely
undefined
common
law
crime
upon
the
existing
obscenity
statute
rendering
that
statute
fatally
vague
and
uncertain.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
there
is
no
question
mr.
justice
marshall
that
some
residents,
have
they
been
home
and
watching
could
have
seen
that
screen
from
outside
the
theater.
there
is
also
no
question
that
passing
motorists
could
have
seen
the
screen.
the
washington
supreme
court
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
well,
there
might
or
might
not
be.
i
don't
think
such
an
assumption
can
be
made
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
no.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes
and
that's
true.
there
is
no
contest
about
that,
but
if
there
was
someone
there
the
screen
would
be
visible.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
i
would
think
so.
i
think
that's
required
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
cohen
case
last
year
for
example
and
by
the
language
of
the
redrup
case,
both
of
which
speak
in
concrete
terms
of
an
actual
assault
upon
privacy
as
a
precondition
for
prosecution
under
these
circumstances.
i
would
think
it
would
not
be
enough
to
prove
for
the
state
to
prove
that
a
work
was
displayed
under
circumstances
where
it
might
have
given
offense
to
someone.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
exactly.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
and
that
is
the
fatal
defect
of
the
prosecution
as
we
see
it,
yes.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
the
opinion
goes
on
to
say
that
the
presence
of
those
juveniles
cannot
support
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
because
at
the
time
in
question
the
state
had
no
statute
directed
to
the
protection
of
juveniles.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
the
answer
is
that
the
record
shows
that
there
were
people
of
minority
age
at
that
fence
watching
at
least
parts
of
the
picture,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
that's
entirely
correct.
the
court
in
judge
mcgowan's
opinion
when
this
opinion
goes
on
to
say
that
although
washington
has
since
passed
a
juvenile
type
statute,
it
had
not
at
the
time
and
therefore
the
presence
of
those
juveniles
cannot
support
the
conviction.
that
the
same
analysis
should
have
been
applied
to
the
privacy
argument
in
our
view
that
also
should
have
required
a
statute.
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
this
motion
picture
is
not
obscene
under
the
roth
definition.
it
has
a
predominant
dramatic
appeal,
a
very
strong
story,
a
story
that
has
been
often
told
and
retold
in
many
different
versions.
it
is
well
within
the
contemporary
standards
of
candor,
the
motion
picture
critics
and
others
are
in
recent
years
have
praised
and
made
important
and
the
tenants
of
audiences
have
made
important
many
films
which
are
no
less
candid
than
this
in
the
portrayal
of
sexual
matters
and
indeed
in
the
court
below
there
was
no
competent
evidence
even
that
this
film
exceeded
current
standards
of
candor
in
any
respect.
and
as
to
the
third
element
redeeming
social
value,
this
film
has
a
moral
message
and
it
has
social
value
according
to
at
least
the
six
impressive
defense
witnesses
who
testified
at
the
trial.
i
would
not
tell
the
court
that
this
film
is
one
of
the
best
films
ever
made.
obviously
it's
not,
but
in
first
amendment
litigation
the
tests
are
almost
always
made
as
to
materials
which
most
of
us
would
not
prefer
to
see,
but
which
are
nonetheless
protected.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
it
is
here
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
saw
it
in
the
court's
view
room
yesterday
for
the
first
time.
judge
matthews
of
the
new
jersey
court
was
correct
in
describing
it
as
a
work
of
art,
those
were
his
words.
a
question
of
whether
it's
a
pleasing
work
of
art
is
real
one
of
taste
and
not
of
obscenity
law.
one
man's
vulgarity
is
another's
lyric
as
the
late
like
mr.
justice
harlan
had
said
for
the
court
in
the
cohen
case
and
that
remark
applies
we
believe
to
this
motion
picture.
now
here
the
washington
court
and
the
prosecution
virtually
concede
what
i
have
just
said,
namely
that
the
film
is
not
obscene.
but
the
playing
it
was
obscene
as
shown
because
scenes
in
the
movie
were
visible
from
a
few
nearby
houses
and
they
postulated
that
the
privacy
of
the
persons
in
those
houses
was
necessarily
invaded
by
the
visibility
of
this
motion
picture.
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that
it
does
not
have
to
judge
the
material
for
obscenity
vel
non
one
way
or
the
other.
now
although
this
necessarily
implies
that
a
different
standard
exists
for
outdoor
theaters
as
compared
to
the
indoor
theaters,
yet,
neither
the
court
nor
the
prosecution
has
suggested
what
that
standard
might
be.
the
exhibitor
is
told
in
effect
you
maybe
prosecuted
under
the
obscenity
statute
for
showing
a
non-obscene
film,
but
it's
up
to
you
to
guess
at
which
film.
if
the
analysis
of
the
washington
court
were
applied
across
the
boards
of
all
motion
pictures,
many
and
i
believe
most
films
could
be
condemned
in
their
dissemination
punished
under
the
obscenity
statutes
on
the
basis
of
very
short
isolated
single
images
that
maybe
on
the
screen
for
a
matter
of
seconds
and
any
such
rule
would
be
a
license
to
suppress
almost
any
film.
the
outdoor
theaters
are
an
important
medium
of
expression
in
the
united
states.
one
of
the
amicus
brief
shows
that
about
25%
of
the
nation's
theaters
are
outdoor
theaters
of
the
present
time.
the
potential
effect
of
this
decision
unless
reversed
on
those
theaters
would
be
chilling
and
suppressing
to
say
that
the
very
least.
the
court's
opinion
below
as
i
say
lapses
into
such
terms
as
offensive
displays,
offensive
expression,
personally
distasteful
and
so
on,
all
of
which
reveal
that
the
decision
below
renders
the
statute
standardless,
devoid
of
standards
and
i
believe
the
state
reinforces
the
truth
of
that
point
in
its
brief
when
it
suggests
that
exhibitors
should
be
guided
by
the
unofficial
industry
reading
system
in
deciding
what
they
should
or
should
not
exhibit
on
pain
of
criminal
prosecution.
it
suggested
in
the
state's
brief
that
the
motion
picture
production
code
readings
should
put
an
exhibitor
on
notice
that
if
he
shows
an
x-rated
film
in
a
manner
deemed
obtrusive
he
can
be
prosecuted.
but,
certainly
the
invocation
of
an
unofficial
standard
like
that
and
we
are
not
even
shown
what
the
standard
is
or
standards
plural
are
in
this
record
cannot
take
the
place
of
a
legislatively
inactive
standard
of
criminal
liability.
the
washington
court
has
read
ginzburg
and
michigan,
redrup
and
the
fanny
hill
case,
a
book
versus
attorney
general
as
authorizing
an
abandonment
of
the
roth
definition
for
obscenity.
that
we
suggest
is
a
patent
and
obvious
misreading
of
those
cases.
in
ginzburg
in
ruling
that
pandering
could
be
considered
in
an
evidentiary
way
as
to
whether
material
was
obscene
or
not.
the
court
expressly
said
that
this
analysis
simply
elaborates
the
test
by
which
the
obscenity
vel
non
of
the
material
must
be
judged.
a
book
versus
attorney
general
was
to
the
same
effect.
michigan
merely
held
that
the
predominant
prurient
appeal
can
be
addressed
to
a
deviant
sexual
group
rather
than
the
majority.
in
redrup,
i
believe
the
court
has
misread
worst
of
all
in
that
per
curiam
decision
where
the
court
reversed
a
number
of
convictions.
it
pointed
out
that
three
elements
were
not
present,
namely
there
was
not
present
a
statue
directed
to
juveniles.
there
was
not
present
showing
of
invasion
of
privacy
and
there
was
not
present
any
showing
of
pandering
under
the
ginzburg
case.
redrup
in
our
view
of
the
case,
left
it
open
for
the
states
to
legislate
as
to
juveniles
and
to
legislate
for
the
protection
of
privacy
and
that
invitation
to
the
states
have
been
extended
much
earlier.
jacobellis
versus
ohio
contains
a
similar
virtual
invitation
to
the
states
to
legislate
as
to
juveniles,
but
holding
as
the
court
has
often
held
that
material
cannot
be
punished
under
general
obscenity
laws
because
it's
unsuitable
for
minors,
that
was
the
holding
of
jacobellis
and
the
same
rule
should
apply
for
the
argument
is
based
on
privacy
as
distinguished
from
minors.
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
states
can
validly
legislate
in
this
area,
but
as
the
court
pointed
out
last
year
in
the
reidel
decision,
the
task
of
restructuring
the
obscenity
laws
is
the
task
of
those
who
write
and
amend
statues
and
ordinances
and
not
the
task
of
a
court.
washington
here
has
bypassed
that
legislative
procedure
and
by
treating
their
obscenity
statute
as
we
have
found,
they
have
converted
it
into
a
statue
with
indefinite
standards
for
the
restriction
of
speech
and
therefore
void
for
vagueness
under
winter
versus
new
york.
and
as
the
court
held
in
the
interstate
circuit
case
in
1968,
the
purpose
of
the
statue
which
in
that
case
was
the
protection
of
juveniles
does
not
mean
that
the
standard
of
specificity
for
first
amendment
purposes
is
relaxed.
vagueness
is
fatal
where
the
privacy
or
minors,
or
some
other
object
is
involved.
just
last
week
in
the
papachristou
versus
jacksonville
case,
the
court
held
an
ordinance
void
for
vagueness
both
because
it
fails
to
apprise
the
citizen
and
because
it
invites
arbitrary
and
radical
risk
and
both
of
those
readings
condemn
the
washington
statue
here
as
it's
been
transformed
by
the
lower
courts
into
a
weapon
for
the
punishment
of
speech.
the
second
basic
reason
for
reversal
which
we
cite,
is
that
this
petitioner
who
was
given
no
fair
warning
that
he
could
be
prosecuted
in
this
fashion.
there
was
only
one
law
on
the
books
that
was
the
general
obscenity
law.
that
law
necessarily
told
him
that
this
picture
was
constitutionally
protected
and
that
it
could
be
exhibited
with
legal
safety.
the
statute
said
nothing
at
all
about
anyone's
right
to
privacy
and
in
fact,
our
state
supreme
court
had
not
even
recognized
a
common
law
right
to
privacy
until
the
day
of
this
very
decision.
so
nothing
told
mr.
rabe
that
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
exhibiting
a
non-obscene
film,
at
a
drive-in,
the
screen
which
could
be
seen
from
a
distance.
the
state
in
effect,
convicted
him
of
an
ex
post
facto
common
law
crime
and
the
ruling
below
runs
a
file
of
cohen
versus
california
reversing
a
conviction
in
a
speech
context
because
there
was
no
statue
putting
the
appellant
there
on
notice
that
certain
types
of
conduct
or
speech
would
not
be
tolerated
in
certain
settings
or
times
or
place.
as
in
bouie
versus
columbia,
the
decision
here
is
unforeseeable
and
retroactive
judicial
expansion
of
precise
statuary
language,
therefore
the
conviction
deprives
petitioner
of
due
process.
it's
worth
noting
also
i
think
that
even
had
there
been
such
a
crime
on
the
books,
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
petitioner
committed
it,
in
the
sense
that
there
was
no
showing
that
anyone's
privacy
was
in
fact
invaded.
as
the
court
held
in
the
mccown
case,
the
presumed
presence
of
unwitting
viewers
or
listeners
should
not
be
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
criminal
liability.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
i
think
in
order
to
prove
that
offense,
yes
that
they
must
first
define
that
the
offense
with
particularity
in
the
statue
and
then
prove
that
the
statue
was
violated
by
an
actual
exhibition
which
actually
invaded
privacy
or
caused
offense
in
that
sense.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
exactly
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
that
is
our
point
and
the
case
can
be
decided
without
reaching
at
all
the
questions
of
what
the
states
constitutionally
could
do
because
here
they
have
done
nothing.
the
third
basic
reason
for
reversal
which
we
urged
to
the
court
is
that
the
petitioner's
motion
to
suppress
the
film
should
have
been
granted.
the
film
was
seized
as
evidence
on
the
basis
of
a
john
doe
type
of
arrest
warrant.
that
warrant
was
issued
on
the
basis
of
the
uncross
examined
testimony
of
one
police
officer
at
an
ex
parte
hearing.
the
magistrate
did
not
see
the
film
that
merely
hurt
the
police
officer.
the
proximate
result
of
that
was
that
this
print
was
suppressed
for
an
entire
year
through
the
trial
court
stage
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
that
is
not
shown
in
the
record
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
can
advice
the
court
that
is
a
general
rule,
it
is
not
easy
at
all
to
obtain
a
substitute
print
when
a
print
is
seized
and
particularly
in
a
location
like
richmond,
washington.
each
print
of
the
motion
picture
is
expensive.
each
one
is
made
in
a
laboratory
and
prints
are
then
dispersed
around
the
united
states
for
first
round
and
then
second
round
and
so
on
and
at
any
given
time,
there
maybe,
if
it's
a
major
motion
picture,
there
maybe
a
few
hundred
prints
in
the
country
but
each
one
is
committed
to
exhibition
at
certain
times
and
places
like
contracts
between
the
distributor
and
the
exhibitor.
this
motion
picture
obviously
is
not
a
major
motion
picture
and
it
would
have
been
that
much
harder
to
get
a
print.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
he
could
not
have
done
so.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes
he
was
and
our
position
is
that
seizure
for
evidential
purposes,
in
effect
is
identical
to
an
injunction
aimed
to
suppressing
the
materials.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
well
we
claim
both,
but
the
emphasis
on
our
brief
has
been
on
the
first
amendment
because
as
we
read
quantity
of
books
against
kansas
and
marcus
against
search
warrant,
the
first
amendment
requires
whether
materials
seized
are
communication
materials
as
opposed
to
narcotic
or
guns
or
contraband,
where
they
are
communications
materials,
the
first
amendment
requires
an
adversary
hearing
as
a
precondition
of
seizure.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes
exactly,
upon
showing
a
probable
cause,
in
other
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
not
yet.
sixth
circuit
courts
have
done
so
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
lee
didn't
talk
about
it.
lee
merely
held
that
the
hearing
there
did
not
focus
searchingly
on
the
question
of
obscenity.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
there
was
no
search
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
merely
an
arrest
warrant
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
this
is
in
the
first
amendment
area
and
special
law
has
to
be
applied
and
the
court
so
held
as
to
books
in
the
quantity
of
books
against
kansas.
it's
been
argued
that
a
distinction
should
be
made
between
seizure
for
purposes
of
destruction
and
seizure
for
purposes
of
evidence.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
i
think
so,
yes,
because
in
the
first
place,
how
was
the
fact
to
establish
that
he
has
1,000
copies
if
there
was
no
adversary
hearing.
i
think
the
ex
parte
hearings
have
to
be
completely
distrusted
for
communications
materials
so
that
state
can
--
seizure
is
the
argument
of
the
state.
in
actual
practice
of
the
lower
court
level,
that
is
particularly
vital
because
so
many
justices
of
the
peace
are
ill-informed
on
first
amendment
law
and
if
there
is
not
a
an
adversary
hearing,
they
tend
to
very
readily
to
authorize
the
seizure
of
books,
motion
pictures
just
on
the
showing
of
offensiveness
or
disagreeability
to
them.
the
only
sound
protection
in
my
view
is
the
protection
of
the
adversary
hearing.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
well
i
think
there
should
have
been
because
to
reach
that
result
the
only
way
to
reach
it
is
either
to
hold
an
ex
parte
hearing
in
which
case
one
runs
the
appreciable
risk
as
the
court
said
in
the
kansas
case
that
a
defacto
prior
restraint
will
occur
or
to
have
an
adversary
hearing
and
one
such
issue
in
the
hearing
could
be
the
quantity
of
duplicates
available.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
i
think
he
should
not
be
able
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
a
policeman's
idea
of
what
constitutes
hard
core
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
i
would
still
say,
even
if
it's
my
idea
a
court
should
determine
in
an
advisory
hearing
before
that
material
is
seized,
otherwise
the
protections
are
forfeited.
it's
a
matter
of
method
and
procedure
i
think
rather
than
an
assumption
in
advance
with
a
certain
type
of
material
or
a
certain
item
of
material
as
obscene
and
not
constitutionally
protected.
as
a
matter
of
procedure
the
only
safe
way
to
proceed
is
the
advisory
hearing
method
and
i
believe
it
can
be
squared
practically
with
the
demands
of
the
law
enforcement.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
courts
of
the
state
of
washington
have
declared
themselves
to
be
not
bound
by
this
court's
constitutional
definition
of
obscenity
and
they
have
thrust
to
decide
to
publish
a
man
criminally
for
exhibiting
a
motion
picture
which
is
clearly
non-obscene
and
is
protected
under
the
first
amendment
guarantee
of
freedom
of
expression.
in
the
course
of
doing
this,
the
courts
of
the
state
of
washington
have
welded
a
general
obscenity
statute
of
the
type
which
typically
exists
in
all
50
states
and
of
the
type
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
made
clear,
can
be
used
only
to
punish
or
suppress
material
which
is
obscene
under
the
test
promulgated
in
the
leading
case
of
roth
versus
united
states.
as
summarized
in
many
case,
since
then,
perhaps
most
explicitly
in
the
book
versus
attorney
general
of
1966,
in
order
to
convict,
the
state
must
prove
the
three
elements
(inaudible).
first,
it
must
be
established
the
predominant
theme
of
the
material
taken
as
a
whole
is
an
appeal
to
currying
an
interest
in
sex
and
not
some
other
kind
of
appeal.
second,
the
material
must
be
patently
offensive
and
affronting
the
contemporary
community
standards
of
candor
in
representing
or
depicting
sexual
matters.
third,
that
the
material
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
i
mention
those
elements
despite
their
well-known
familiarity
to
the
court
and
the
counsel
in
this
field
because
of
our
belief
that
it
is
vital,
that
this
definition
be
honored
and
adhered
to,
if
freedom
of
speech
is
to
survive
the
application
of
the
obscenity
laws
in
united
states.
if
this
definition
should
be
weakened
or
abandoned,
the
small
crack
in
the
wall
which
is
afforded
to
the
general
obscenity
laws
as
to
unprotected
speech,
will
very
quickly
become
a
wide
open
door
to
the
punishment
of
protected
expression.
in
roth,
the
court
pointed
out
that
it
was
implicit
in
the
history
of
the
first
amendment
that
obscenity
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
and
that
finding,
that
belief
is
the
basis
for
obscenity
law
as
it
exists
today.
and
the
court
has
repeatedly
made
clear,
both
in
full
scale
opinions
and
in
per
curiam
reversals
over
the
last
15
years
that
that
definition
applies
so
as
to
protect
material
which
most
people
would
find
offensive,
disgusting,
of
little
value
perhaps.
bit
the
definition
must
be
adhered
to
in
order
for
the
first
amendment
guaranteed
to
be
carried
out
in
the
actual
day-to-day
enforcement
of
the
laws.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
$600
fine
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
he
was
not
sentenced
to
prison
at
all,
just
a
fine.
the
sentencing
judge
remark
to,
however,
that
he
was
fixing
the
fine
at
a
level
he
considered
high
enough
to
prevent
such
display
of
motion
pictures
from
happening
again
in
that
community.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
is
based
on
the
verbatim
of
carmen
without
the
music.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
carmen
baby.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
it
did.
as
several
witnesses
testified
the
trial,
the
story,
follows
the
story
line
of
opera
carmen,
which
in
turns
follow
a
novel
by
mérimée,
a
french
novelist.
the
character
of
carmen
is
very
similar,
an
evil,
young
woman
fatalistically
headed
toward
her
own
destruction.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
in
a
few
cases,
there
have
been
prison
sentences
in
the
neighborhood
of
30
days
as
i
recall
most
recently
in
seattle.
in
motion
picture
prosecutions,
prison
sentences
have
only
been
meted
out
in
the
type
of
film
that's
shown
in
places
called
the
adult
bookstore
for
example,
which
specializes
in
erotic
materials.
in
exhibitions
for
general
consumption
such
as
the
present
case,
fines
have
been
usually
penalty
imposed.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
it
was
indeed,
it
was
shown
in
seattle,
and
it
was
shown
in
yakima,
which
is
not
far
from
richland.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
in
public
theaters.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
it
has,
it's
been
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
reviewed
in
the
new
york
times.
one
witness
testified
in
the
court
below
that
he
saw
it
shown
at
oak
ridge,
tennessee
in
a
situation
where
it
was
shown
in
an
outdoor
screen
and
the
sound
was
piped
into
the
motel
for
those
wishing
to
listen.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
it
was
decided
in
new
jersey
and
in
maryland
i
believe
and
the
opinion
in
new
jersey
i
think
is
very
eloquent.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
no,
in
neither
state,
mr.
justice
marshall,
they
did
involve
drive-in.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
it
involved
the
same
movie,
but
shown
at
an
indoor
theater.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
the
photographs
in
the
record
show
that
there
are
a
few
depleted
houses
at
some
distance
from
the
screen,
some
of
which
would
be
able
to
have
the
view.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
there
was
nothing
to
stop
anyone
of
any
age
for
standing
at
the
fence
and
looking,
that
there
is
a
physical
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
i
am
sorry.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes,
i
do.
i
think
the
state
could
probably
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes,
i
think,
the
state
could
properly
legislate
in
that
area
what
has
been
called
the
area
of
obtrusive
display
legislation.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes,
indeed
it
has
and
why
the
states
have
not
more
clearly
picked
up
that
opportunity
and
acted
upon
it
before
how,
i
don't
know.
what
you
have,
we
have
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
new
york
has,
arizona
has,
but
i
think
it's
still
a
minority
of
states
that
have.
our
state
could
and
should,
but
hasn't
and
that's
the
fatal
defect
in
the
present
prosecution.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
there
was
nothing
shown
in
the
record
here
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
there
was,
in
fact,
any
exposure
to
people
outside
the
drive-in.
there
was
no
evidence
that
anybody
outside
the
drive-in,
saw
that
film
or
complained
about
it,
or
was
affected
by
it
in
many
ways.
but
we
do
concede
and
i
think
there
is
no
contest
that
a
state
can
legislate
in
the
obtrusive
display
area
by
enacting
a
clearly,
narrowly,
specifically
drawn
statute
which
could
apply
to
the
drive-in
motion
picture
theaters
as
well
as
billboards,
news
stands
and
other
types
of
displays.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes,
i
believe
such
legislation
could
be
enacted
and
in
the
report
of
the
president's
commission
on
obscenity
and
pornography,
there
is
even
a
model
statute
to
that
effect.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
that
is
one
of
our
basic
complaints,
yes,
indeed
it
is
because
nothing
in
the
statute
gave
mr.
rabe
any
notice
that
he
could
be
prosecuted
on
any
theory
for
showing
a
non-obscene
film
under
certain
circumstances
such
as
an
outdoor
exhibition.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
that's
not
our
only
position.
we
further
contend
that
in
expanding
the
obscenity
statute
as
it
did
so
as
to
sweep
this
picture
within
its
ambit,
the
washington
supreme
court
has
rendered
that
obscenity
statute
void
for
vagueness
in
the
application
because
it
has
punished
the
exhibition
of
the
film
on
the
ground
of
offensiveness
or
obtrusiveness,
words
which
recur
throughout
the
opinion
with
no
definition,
no
substantive
standard
whatever
to
guide
either
this
defendant
or
any
other
exhibitor
in
the
future
as
to
what
he
could
or
could
not
exhibit
in
an
outdoor
theater.
the
prime
danger
of
the
many
dangers
we
see
in
the
washington
opinion
is
that
the
court
there
expressly
says
that
even
though
it
is
enforcing
a
general
obscenity
statute,
it
does
not
have
to
be
guided
by
the
roth
definition
of
obscenity.
that
we
believe
cries
out
more
than
any
other
single
element
in
the
case
for
a
reversal.
the
court
in
our
view
has
misread
this
court's
decisions
in
ginzburg,
michigan
and
redrup
and
has
engrafted
an
ill-defined
or
completely
undefined
common
law
crime
upon
the
existing
obscenity
statute
rendering
that
statute
fatally
vague
and
uncertain.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
there
is
no
question
mr.
justice
marshall
that
some
residents,
have
they
been
home
and
watching
could
have
seen
that
screen
from
outside
the
theater.
there
is
also
no
question
that
passing
motorists
could
have
seen
the
screen.
the
washington
supreme
court
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
well,
there
might
or
might
not
be.
i
don't
think
such
an
assumption
can
be
made
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
no.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes
and
that's
true.
there
is
no
contest
about
that,
but
if
there
was
someone
there
the
screen
would
be
visible.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
i
would
think
so.
i
think
that's
required
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
cohen
case
last
year
for
example
and
by
the
language
of
the
redrup
case,
both
of
which
speak
in
concrete
terms
of
an
actual
assault
upon
privacy
as
a
precondition
for
prosecution
under
these
circumstances.
i
would
think
it
would
not
be
enough
to
prove
for
the
state
to
prove
that
a
work
was
displayed
under
circumstances
where
it
might
have
given
offense
to
someone.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
exactly.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
and
that
is
the
fatal
defect
of
the
prosecution
as
we
see
it,
yes.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
the
opinion
goes
on
to
say
that
the
presence
of
those
juveniles
cannot
support
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
because
at
the
time
in
question
the
state
had
no
statute
directed
to
the
protection
of
juveniles.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
the
answer
is
that
the
record
shows
that
there
were
people
of
minority
age
at
that
fence
watching
at
least
parts
of
the
picture,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
that's
entirely
correct.
the
court
in
judge
mcgowan's
opinion
when
this
opinion
goes
on
to
say
that
although
washington
has
since
passed
a
juvenile
type
statute,
it
had
not
at
the
time
and
therefore
the
presence
of
those
juveniles
cannot
support
the
conviction.
that
the
same
analysis
should
have
been
applied
to
the
privacy
argument
in
our
view
that
also
should
have
required
a
statute.
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
this
motion
picture
is
not
obscene
under
the
roth
definition.
it
has
a
predominant
dramatic
appeal,
a
very
strong
story,
a
story
that
has
been
often
told
and
retold
in
many
different
versions.
it
is
well
within
the
contemporary
standards
of
candor,
the
motion
picture
critics
and
others
are
in
recent
years
have
praised
and
made
important
and
the
tenants
of
audiences
have
made
important
many
films
which
are
no
less
candid
than
this
in
the
portrayal
of
sexual
matters
and
indeed
in
the
court
below
there
was
no
competent
evidence
even
that
this
film
exceeded
current
standards
of
candor
in
any
respect.
and
as
to
the
third
element
redeeming
social
value,
this
film
has
a
moral
message
and
it
has
social
value
according
to
at
least
the
six
impressive
defense
witnesses
who
testified
at
the
trial.
i
would
not
tell
the
court
that
this
film
is
one
of
the
best
films
ever
made.
obviously
it's
not,
but
in
first
amendment
litigation
the
tests
are
almost
always
made
as
to
materials
which
most
of
us
would
not
prefer
to
see,
but
which
are
nonetheless
protected.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
it
is
here
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
saw
it
in
the
court's
view
room
yesterday
for
the
first
time.
judge
matthews
of
the
new
jersey
court
was
correct
in
describing
it
as
a
work
of
art,
those
were
his
words.
a
question
of
whether
it's
a
pleasing
work
of
art
is
real
one
of
taste
and
not
of
obscenity
law.
one
man's
vulgarity
is
another's
lyric
as
the
late
like
mr.
justice
harlan
had
said
for
the
court
in
the
cohen
case
and
that
remark
applies
we
believe
to
this
motion
picture.
now
here
the
washington
court
and
the
prosecution
virtually
concede
what
i
have
just
said,
namely
that
the
film
is
not
obscene.
but
the
playing
it
was
obscene
as
shown
because
scenes
in
the
movie
were
visible
from
a
few
nearby
houses
and
they
postulated
that
the
privacy
of
the
persons
in
those
houses
was
necessarily
invaded
by
the
visibility
of
this
motion
picture.
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that
it
does
not
have
to
judge
the
material
for
obscenity
vel
non
one
way
or
the
other.
now
although
this
necessarily
implies
that
a
different
standard
exists
for
outdoor
theaters
as
compared
to
the
indoor
theaters,
yet,
neither
the
court
nor
the
prosecution
has
suggested
what
that
standard
might
be.
the
exhibitor
is
told
in
effect
you
maybe
prosecuted
under
the
obscenity
statute
for
showing
a
non-obscene
film,
but
it's
up
to
you
to
guess
at
which
film.
if
the
analysis
of
the
washington
court
were
applied
across
the
boards
of
all
motion
pictures,
many
and
i
believe
most
films
could
be
condemned
in
their
dissemination
punished
under
the
obscenity
statutes
on
the
basis
of
very
short
isolated
single
images
that
maybe
on
the
screen
for
a
matter
of
seconds
and
any
such
rule
would
be
a
license
to
suppress
almost
any
film.
the
outdoor
theaters
are
an
important
medium
of
expression
in
the
united
states.
one
of
the
amicus
brief
shows
that
about
25%
of
the
nation's
theaters
are
outdoor
theaters
of
the
present
time.
the
potential
effect
of
this
decision
unless
reversed
on
those
theaters
would
be
chilling
and
suppressing
to
say
that
the
very
least.
the
court's
opinion
below
as
i
say
lapses
into
such
terms
as
offensive
displays,
offensive
expression,
personally
distasteful
and
so
on,
all
of
which
reveal
that
the
decision
below
renders
the
statute
standardless,
devoid
of
standards
and
i
believe
the
state
reinforces
the
truth
of
that
point
in
its
brief
when
it
suggests
that
exhibitors
should
be
guided
by
the
unofficial
industry
reading
system
in
deciding
what
they
should
or
should
not
exhibit
on
pain
of
criminal
prosecution.
it
suggested
in
the
state's
brief
that
the
motion
picture
production
code
readings
should
put
an
exhibitor
on
notice
that
if
he
shows
an
x-rated
film
in
a
manner
deemed
obtrusive
he
can
be
prosecuted.
but,
certainly
the
invocation
of
an
unofficial
standard
like
that
and
we
are
not
even
shown
what
the
standard
is
or
standards
plural
are
in
this
record
cannot
take
the
place
of
a
legislatively
inactive
standard
of
criminal
liability.
the
washington
court
has
read
ginzburg
and
michigan,
redrup
and
the
fanny
hill
case,
a
book
versus
attorney
general
as
authorizing
an
abandonment
of
the
roth
definition
for
obscenity.
that
we
suggest
is
a
patent
and
obvious
misreading
of
those
cases.
in
ginzburg
in
ruling
that
pandering
could
be
considered
in
an
evidentiary
way
as
to
whether
material
was
obscene
or
not.
the
court
expressly
said
that
this
analysis
simply
elaborates
the
test
by
which
the
obscenity
vel
non
of
the
material
must
be
judged.
a
book
versus
attorney
general
was
to
the
same
effect.
michigan
merely
held
that
the
predominant
prurient
appeal
can
be
addressed
to
a
deviant
sexual
group
rather
than
the
majority.
in
redrup,
i
believe
the
court
has
misread
worst
of
all
in
that
per
curiam
decision
where
the
court
reversed
a
number
of
convictions.
it
pointed
out
that
three
elements
were
not
present,
namely
there
was
not
present
a
statue
directed
to
juveniles.
there
was
not
present
showing
of
invasion
of
privacy
and
there
was
not
present
any
showing
of
pandering
under
the
ginzburg
case.
redrup
in
our
view
of
the
case,
left
it
open
for
the
states
to
legislate
as
to
juveniles
and
to
legislate
for
the
protection
of
privacy
and
that
invitation
to
the
states
have
been
extended
much
earlier.
jacobellis
versus
ohio
contains
a
similar
virtual
invitation
to
the
states
to
legislate
as
to
juveniles,
but
holding
as
the
court
has
often
held
that
material
cannot
be
punished
under
general
obscenity
laws
because
it's
unsuitable
for
minors,
that
was
the
holding
of
jacobellis
and
the
same
rule
should
apply
for
the
argument
is
based
on
privacy
as
distinguished
from
minors.
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
states
can
validly
legislate
in
this
area,
but
as
the
court
pointed
out
last
year
in
the
reidel
decision,
the
task
of
restructuring
the
obscenity
laws
is
the
task
of
those
who
write
and
amend
statues
and
ordinances
and
not
the
task
of
a
court.
washington
here
has
bypassed
that
legislative
procedure
and
by
treating
their
obscenity
statute
as
we
have
found,
they
have
converted
it
into
a
statue
with
indefinite
standards
for
the
restriction
of
speech
and
therefore
void
for
vagueness
under
winter
versus
new
york.
and
as
the
court
held
in
the
interstate
circuit
case
in
1968,
the
purpose
of
the
statue
which
in
that
case
was
the
protection
of
juveniles
does
not
mean
that
the
standard
of
specificity
for
first
amendment
purposes
is
relaxed.
vagueness
is
fatal
where
the
privacy
or
minors,
or
some
other
object
is
involved.
just
last
week
in
the
papachristou
versus
jacksonville
case,
the
court
held
an
ordinance
void
for
vagueness
both
because
it
fails
to
apprise
the
citizen
and
because
it
invites
arbitrary
and
radical
risk
and
both
of
those
readings
condemn
the
washington
statue
here
as
it's
been
transformed
by
the
lower
courts
into
a
weapon
for
the
punishment
of
speech.
the
second
basic
reason
for
reversal
which
we
cite,
is
that
this
petitioner
who
was
given
no
fair
warning
that
he
could
be
prosecuted
in
this
fashion.
there
was
only
one
law
on
the
books
that
was
the
general
obscenity
law.
that
law
necessarily
told
him
that
this
picture
was
constitutionally
protected
and
that
it
could
be
exhibited
with
legal
safety.
the
statute
said
nothing
at
all
about
anyone's
right
to
privacy
and
in
fact,
our
state
supreme
court
had
not
even
recognized
a
common
law
right
to
privacy
until
the
day
of
this
very
decision.
so
nothing
told
mr.
rabe
that
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
exhibiting
a
non-obscene
film,
at
a
drive-in,
the
screen
which
could
be
seen
from
a
distance.
the
state
in
effect,
convicted
him
of
an
ex
post
facto
common
law
crime
and
the
ruling
below
runs
a
file
of
cohen
versus
california
reversing
a
conviction
in
a
speech
context
because
there
was
no
statue
putting
the
appellant
there
on
notice
that
certain
types
of
conduct
or
speech
would
not
be
tolerated
in
certain
settings
or
times
or
place.
as
in
bouie
versus
columbia,
the
decision
here
is
unforeseeable
and
retroactive
judicial
expansion
of
precise
statuary
language,
therefore
the
conviction
deprives
petitioner
of
due
process.
it's
worth
noting
also
i
think
that
even
had
there
been
such
a
crime
on
the
books,
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
petitioner
committed
it,
in
the
sense
that
there
was
no
showing
that
anyone's
privacy
was
in
fact
invaded.
as
the
court
held
in
the
mccown
case,
the
presumed
presence
of
unwitting
viewers
or
listeners
should
not
be
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
criminal
liability.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
i
think
in
order
to
prove
that
offense,
yes
that
they
must
first
define
that
the
offense
with
particularity
in
the
statue
and
then
prove
that
the
statue
was
violated
by
an
actual
exhibition
which
actually
invaded
privacy
or
caused
offense
in
that
sense.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
exactly
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
that
is
our
point
and
the
case
can
be
decided
without
reaching
at
all
the
questions
of
what
the
states
constitutionally
could
do
because
here
they
have
done
nothing.
the
third
basic
reason
for
reversal
which
we
urged
to
the
court
is
that
the
petitioner's
motion
to
suppress
the
film
should
have
been
granted.
the
film
was
seized
as
evidence
on
the
basis
of
a
john
doe
type
of
arrest
warrant.
that
warrant
was
issued
on
the
basis
of
the
uncross
examined
testimony
of
one
police
officer
at
an
ex
parte
hearing.
the
magistrate
did
not
see
the
film
that
merely
hurt
the
police
officer.
the
proximate
result
of
that
was
that
this
print
was
suppressed
for
an
entire
year
through
the
trial
court
stage
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
that
is
not
shown
in
the
record
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
can
advice
the
court
that
is
a
general
rule,
it
is
not
easy
at
all
to
obtain
a
substitute
print
when
a
print
is
seized
and
particularly
in
a
location
like
richmond,
washington.
each
print
of
the
motion
picture
is
expensive.
each
one
is
made
in
a
laboratory
and
prints
are
then
dispersed
around
the
united
states
for
first
round
and
then
second
round
and
so
on
and
at
any
given
time,
there
maybe,
if
it's
a
major
motion
picture,
there
maybe
a
few
hundred
prints
in
the
country
but
each
one
is
committed
to
exhibition
at
certain
times
and
places
like
contracts
between
the
distributor
and
the
exhibitor.
this
motion
picture
obviously
is
not
a
major
motion
picture
and
it
would
have
been
that
much
harder
to
get
a
print.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
he
could
not
have
done
so.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes
he
was
and
our
position
is
that
seizure
for
evidential
purposes,
in
effect
is
identical
to
an
injunction
aimed
to
suppressing
the
materials.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
well
we
claim
both,
but
the
emphasis
on
our
brief
has
been
on
the
first
amendment
because
as
we
read
quantity
of
books
against
kansas
and
marcus
against
search
warrant,
the
first
amendment
requires
whether
materials
seized
are
communication
materials
as
opposed
to
narcotic
or
guns
or
contraband,
where
they
are
communications
materials,
the
first
amendment
requires
an
adversary
hearing
as
a
precondition
of
seizure.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes
exactly,
upon
showing
a
probable
cause,
in
other
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
not
yet.
sixth
circuit
courts
have
done
so
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
lee
didn't
talk
about
it.
lee
merely
held
that
the
hearing
there
did
not
focus
searchingly
on
the
question
of
obscenity.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
there
was
no
search
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
merely
an
arrest
warrant
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
yes.
mr.
william

yes.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
this
is
in
the
first
amendment
area
and
special
law
has
to
be
applied
and
the
court
so
held
as
to
books
in
the
quantity
of
books
against
kansas.
it's
been
argued
that
a
distinction
should
be
made
between
seizure
for
purposes
of
destruction
and
seizure
for
purposes
of
evidence.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
i
think
so,
yes,
because
in
the
first
place,
how
was
the
fact
to
establish
that
he
has
1,000
copies
if
there
was
no
adversary
hearing.
i
think
the
ex
parte
hearings
have
to
be
completely
distrusted
for
communications
materials
so
that
state
can
--
seizure
is
the
argument
of
the
state.
in
actual
practice
of
the
lower
court
level,
that
is
particularly
vital
because
so
many
justices
of
the
peace
are
ill-informed
on
first
amendment
law
and
if
there
is
not
a
an
adversary
hearing,
they
tend
to
very
readily
to
authorize
the
seizure
of
books,
motion
pictures
just
on
the
showing
of
offensiveness
or
disagreeability
to
them.
the
only
sound
protection
in
my
view
is
the
protection
of
the
adversary
hearing.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
well
i
think
there
should
have
been
because
to
reach
that
result
the
only
way
to
reach
it
is
either
to
hold
an
ex
parte
hearing
in
which
case
one
runs
the
appreciable
risk
as
the
court
said
in
the
kansas
case
that
a
defacto
prior
restraint
will
occur
or
to
have
an
adversary
hearing
and
one
such
issue
in
the
hearing
could
be
the
quantity
of
duplicates
available.
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
i
think
he
should
not
be
able
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
a
policeman's
idea
of
what
constitutes
hard
core
--
mr.
william
l.
dwyer
i
would
still
say,
even
if
it's
my
idea
a
court
should
determine
in
an
advisory
hearing
before
that
material
is
seized,
otherwise
the
protections
are
forfeited.
it's
a
matter
of
method
and
procedure
i
think
rather
than
an
assumption
in
advance
with
a
certain
type
of
material
or
a
certain
item
of
material
as
obscene
and
not
constitutionally
protected.
as
a
matter
of
procedure
the
only
safe
way
to
proceed
is
the
advisory
hearing
method
and
i
believe
it
can
be
squared
practically
with
the
demands
of
the
law
enforcement.
thank
you
very
much.
