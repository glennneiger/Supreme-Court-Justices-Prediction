mr.
donald
j.
veverka
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first
point
out
that
although
afdc
benefits
were
cut-off
at
the
time
that
these
children
attended
a
college
or
university
that
they
were
provided
with
general
assistance
funds.
i
believe
the
issue
before
this
court
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
believe
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
or
the
supremacy
clause
requires
the
states
to
participate
fully
in
the
federal
afdc
program
regardless
of
their
financial
condition.
i
think
this
is
contrary
to
the
congressional
intent
which
provided
that
the
programs
would
be
implemented
or
that
financial
assistance
would
be
provided,
as
far
as
practicable
under
the
conditions
in
each
state.
i
think
it
is
somewhat
important
to
know
that
illinois'
involvement
in
this
case
is
not
because
that
it
has
cut
grants,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
illinois
provides
a
100%
of
need
or
not
because
that
it
has
established
any
strange
eligibility
requirements,
but
simply
because
it
adopted
a
classification
which
was
originally
established
by
congress
in
1964.
now,
prior
to
1964,
the
federal
definition
of
a
dependent
child
was
a
child
under
18.
then
in
1964,
congress
amended
the
definition
and
it
defined
a
dependent
child
as
someone
under
the
age
of
18
or
someone
under
the
age
of
21
who
is
attending
a
high
school
which
would
lead
--
a
high
school
course
of
study
which
would
lead
to
the
diploma
or
vocational
training
school
which
would
lead
to
gainful
employment.
at
the
time
that
congress
amended
its
definition
of
a
dependent
child,
illinois
similarly
amended
its
public
aid
code
to
provide
essentially
the
same
definition.
and
in
1965,
one
year
later,
congress
again
expanded
the
definition
but
unfortunately,
the
financial
conditions
in
state
of
illinois
and
the
nine
others
states
have
not
allowed
it
to
expand
the
definition.
although
congress
has
consistently,
since
1940,
recognized
that
the
state
does
not
have
to
expand
its
benefits
every
time
that
congress
expands
its
definition
of
a
dependent
child.
for
example,
in
1940,
the
age
limit
was
16
and
congress
raised
the
age
limit
of
a
dependent
child
from
16
to
18,
and
at
that
time
the
house
report
stated,
it
is
estimated
that
about
a
100,000
additional
children
may
obtain
the
aid
by
virtue
of
this
change
provided
all
states
amend
their
laws
accordingly.
this
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
on
page
36.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
think,
your
honor
that
if
the
state
adopts
a
classification
established
by
congress
that
here
is
the
right
and
congress,
i
think
has
expressly
recognized
the
fact
that
it
has
the
right
to
take
the
same
steps
as
are
established
by
congress.
i
think
that
if
it
adopts
the
same
requirements
that
congress
require,
the
same
requirements
that
congress
adopts,
it
is
acting
rationally.
and
again,
i
think
that
the
test
is
rationality
held
from
time
to
time
when
congress
has
expanded
the
definition
of
what
it
is
a
dependent
child.
for
example,
my
recollection
is
that
when
they
expanded
it
from
16
to
18,
there
was
a
requirement
that
they
would
be
in
school.
so
the
point
is,
is
that
congress
is
taken
this
step,
has
taken
this
approach
throughout
the
time
that
it
is
expanded
the
definition
from
time
to
time
as
it
expanded.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
at
the
time
that
they
first
made
the
classification,
it
was
vocational
and
technical
school.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
and
then
a
year
later,
it
was
expanded
to
include
kids
who
are
in
colleges
or
university.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true,
your
honor
but
at
the
same
time
that
they
did
that
and
at
all
times
that
they
have
expanded
that
definition,
they
have
made
it
clear
that
the
state
can
expand
it
if
the
financial
conditions
are
as
far
as
is
practical
under
the
laws
of
the
state.
i
believe
that
a
state
can
take
that
approach
as
long
as
there
is
a
rational
distinction
and
i
believe
that
there
is
a
rational
distinction
here
between
the
classification
which
congress
originally
set
up
in
1964
and
classification
which
is
later
adopted
in
1965.
i
was
referring
to
the
time
that
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
pardon
me?
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
i
think
that
under
the
history
of
social
security
act,
congress
has
recognized
the
fact
that
not
all
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
believe
you
do
get
a
diploma,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
well,
i
draw
that
distinction
because
of
the
fact
that
normally,
you
speak
of
the
diploma
in
terms
of
a
formal
type
educational
as
opposed
to
vocational
or
technical
type.
you
do
get
a
diploma
of
some
kind.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
is
recognition.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
congress
picked
up
this
category
in
the
first
place
in
1964
and
the
way
in
which
they
did
it.
i
think
that
it
was
a
realization
that
there
are
some
who
are
not
interested
in
a
high
school
course
of
the
action
in
formal
education
as
we
know
it.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true,
your
honor.
a
child
in
vocational
and
technical
school
and
a
child
in
high
school
and
that
is
exactly
my
point.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
it
changes
because
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
that
is
not
true,
your
honor.
the
point
that
i
am
make
is
that
if
the
state
of
illinois
had
a
$100
to
give
to
someone
and
it
had
to
take
its
choice
between
a
child
who
is
say
8-years-old
and
a
20-year-old
child,
that
is
true
that
under
the
definition
of
what
is
needy
and
i
might
point
out
that
someone
who
is
needy
may
be
a
22-year-old
or
23-year-old,
it
may
involve
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
--
any
particular
age.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
but
the
difference
is
they
have
the
same
needs
but
the
state
of
illinois
is
filled
in
a
different
way.
the
fact
is,
that
when
somebody
graduates
from
high
school
and
gets
a
high
school
diploma
and
enters
the
junior
college
or
a
college,
he
then
is
eligible
as
opposed
to
a
child
in
vocational
or
technical
school,
he
is
then
eligible
to
get
tuition
and
grants.
a
child
who
in
technical
or
vocational
school,
has
the
same
needs
but
he
is
not
eligible
because
in
most
cases,
he
does
not
have
a
high
school
diploma
and
that
is
the
key.
the
difference
between
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
under
the
illinois
scheme
of
providing
grants,
he
does
not
have
had
to
show
the
superior
capacity.
the
requirements
for
a
tuition
require
that
he
be
on
the
upper
half
of
his
class
and
that
he
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
neither
one
ever
applied
for
a
scholarship
or
a
grant.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
they
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
the
grants
are
based
solely
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
if
they
applied
for
it,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
based
on
financial
needs,
grants
are
based
solely
on
financial
needs.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
if
they
are
a
high
school
graduate,
which
they
are.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
in
addition
of
the
scholarships,
there
are
also
grants
under
the
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
--
the
illinois
states
scholarship
commission,
this
was
established
in
1957.
now,
under
that
commission,
the
legislature
set
up
a
whole
series
of
scholarships,
grants
and
guaranteed
loans
which
were
designed
solely
for
financially
needy.
now,
a
child
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
for
schooling.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
in
addition
of
the
scholarship,
they
can
also
get
grants.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor
the
statute
is
silent
on
that.
i
attempted
to
find
out.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
understand
that
as
a
practical
matter
if
the
child
is
in
a
technical
or
vocational
school
and
he
is
expected
to
pay
tuition
for
example,
which
may
be
$850
or
$900,
as
a
practical
matter,
he
is
in
approximately
the
same
position
as
somebody
who
is
attending
a
college,
who
is
getting
a
grant
to
cover
expenses
at
a
college,
but
is
not
getting
the
living
expenses.
we
have
provided
--
state
of
illinois
has
provided
aid
in
two
different
areas,
but
essentially,
they
have
equalized
the
conditions.
the
point
that
i
am
attempting
to
make
is
that
if
the
state
of
illinois
had
a
$100
to
give
and
it
had
a
choice
between
an
8-year-old
child
and
a
20-year-old
child,
now
both
of
them
could
fall
within
the
technical
definition
of
what
is
a
needy
child
in
the
sense
that
they
are
making
less
than
the
standard
of
need.
but
the
fact
remains
that
if
we
assume
that
illinois
has
$100
and
it
chooses
to
give
it
to
the
8-year-old,
i
do
not
think
it
could
be
said
to
be
arbitrary
that
it
chose
to
give
that
$100.00
to
the
8-year-old
as
opposed
to
20-year-old.
the
point
being
that
even
among
those
who
are
technically
classified
as
needy,
there
are
some
who
are
more
in
the
need
of
help
than
others.
the
point
is
that
here,
those
who
are
in
technical
or
vocational
school,
although,
they
are
technically
as
needy
as
somebody
who
is
in
a
college
or
university,
those
children
are
still
less
in
need
of
number
one
because
it
is
more
likely
than
not
the
kid
in
the
technical
or
vocational
school
does
not
have
a
high
school
degree
which
means
that
he
has
no
choice,
he
cannot
get
into
a
college
or
university.
he
can
only
get
into
a
technical
school.
secondly,
he
is
not
in
as
much
need
because
of
the
fact
that
when
he
gets
that
high
school
degree,
when
he
gets
into
a
college
or
university,
he
is
then
available
for
this
tuition
which
of
course,
would
not
apply
in
the
case
of
a
junior
college
and
the
grants
in
the
guaranteed
loans
and
especially
the
grant.
so
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
child
who
is
in
a
technical
or
vocational
school,
educationally
under
most
state
is
at
a
distinct
disadvantage
because
of
the
fact
that
he
cannot
get
the
same
assistance.
and
again
the
point
is,
that
a
child,
their
high
school
degree
does
mark
the
difference
between
a
child
who
is
more
in
need
of
help
than
the
other
child.
and
again,
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
the
fact
that
in
1965,
now
when
congress
established
and
expanded
the
definition,
at
that
time,
it
pointed
out
and
this
is
contained
on
pages
36
and
37
of
our
brief
that
under
existing
laws,
states
at
their
option
may
continue
payments
and
then
the
senatorial
committee
report
went
on
to
say
federal
sharing
for
this
purpose
would
thus
be
available
to
states
who
implement
such
a
program,
for
payments
to
children
regularly
attending
a
college
or
university
as
well
as
those
attending
high
school
or
vocational
school.
but
congress
has
made
it
clear
that
the
states
can
as
finances
allow
develop
the
program
as
long
as
there
is
a
rational
choice
and
again,
i
believe
that
there
is
a
rational
choice.
counsel
was
candid
enough
to
admit
that
we
are
talking
about
not
only
post-education,
post-high
school
education
but
also
the
equivalent
and
for
time
that
congress
originally
established
this
classification,
if
you
examine
the
classification
as
they
set
up,
they
spoke
in
terms
of
someone
who
is
attending
a
high
school
and
the
course
of
study
which
would
lead
to
a
degree
or
vocational
or
technical
school
which
would
lead
the
gainful
employment.
i
think
the
point
is
that
congress
at
this
time
realized
the
fact
that
not
everyone
that
the
state
was
concerned
with
that
not
everyone
that
congress
was
concerned
about
was
somebody
who
would
want
to
go
back
in
high
school
and
get
a
degree.
i
think
it
was
concerned
about
the
kid
who
drops
out
of
high
school
and
finds
that
he
has
no
aptitude
for
it
and
desires
instead
to
go
to
a
vocational
or
technical
school.
but
i
think
that
we
are
not
talking
about
the
same
class
of
kids.
i
think
that
the
principles
of
this
court
has
enunciated
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
the
state
can
attack
as
much
of
a
problem
as
its
finances
allow.
now,
no
discussion
would
be
complete
without
a
picture
of
the
situation
in
illinois
that
exists
now
because
of
a
substantial
increase,
applied
full
increase
in
the
afdc
cases,
governor
ogilvie
announced
that
there
is
a
$108
million
overall
deficit
in
the
welfare
programs
and
specifically
$107
million
deficit
in
state
funds.
now,
the
governor
was
faced
with
either
cutting
grants
and
in
the
report
which
he
submit
in
october
1971,
he
spoke
in
terms
of
one-third
cut
in
the
standard
of
need
as
opposed
to
a
100%,
giving
a
100%
standard
of
need
they
would
mean
roughly
67
or
70%
standard
of
need.
in
an
attempt
to
alleviate
this
problem,
what
he
did
was
he
transferred
funds
from
the
general
assistance
funds,
general
assistance
fund
which
is
truly
a
state
program
into
afdc,
he
transferred
$21
million
and
this
is
then
met
the
afdc
budget.
now,
litigation
resulted
and
as
of
this
time,
the
governor
has
been
enjoined
from
carrying
out
this
program.
but
the
point
is
that
at
this
time,
there
is
a
possibility
of
cutting
the
standard
of
need
in
afdc
cases.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
constitution
requires
the
state
of
illinois
to
take
the
money,
assuming
that
this
is
the
condition,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
constitution
requires
the
state
of
illinois
to
take
money
from
the
8-year-old
and
the
9-year-old
and
the
10-year-old
and
give
it
to
a
20-year-old
basketball
player.
we
believe
that
we
have
helped
those
who
are
most
in
need
under
illinois
law,
namely
those
without
the
high
school
degree,
those
who
say
in
a
period
of
a
short
time
could
become
employable
within
one
employable
report,
we
believe
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
acted
rationally.
we
believe
that
congress
has
realized
every
time
that
it
has
expanded
the
definition.
from
1940
on
they
have
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
states
were
free
to
either
adopt
the
amendments
to
expand
the
programs
or
not
to.
hew,
the
administrative
body
which
administers
the
act
is
here
before
this
court.
they
filed
an
amicus
curiae
brief.
they
have
taken
the
position
that
the
states
are
free
to
implement
a
program
as
its
finances
allow.
in
light
of
the
views
that
congress
has
expressed,
the
states
are
free
to
either
expand
their
programs
or
not
expand
their
programs
and
again
as
was
pointed
out,
there
are
substantial
number
of
states
which
do
not
comply
100%
with
the
federal
program
which
have
not
expanded
the
federal
program.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
it
depends
on
the
course
and
the
appendix
which
i
had
support
in
my
brief.
i
took
the
chicago
area
of
vocational
schools
and
i
listed
the
course
and
their
lengths
of
time.
in
addition
to
that,
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
that
the
report
of
the
--
it
was
by
house
committee
on
education
and
they
found
that,
it
was
a
republican
task
force
on
education
and
they
found
that
the
average
length
of
a
vocational
school
was
with
approximately
four
months
to
a
year
which
is
another
point.
if
somebody
attends
a
junior
college,
we
are
talking
essentially
about
a
two-year
program
and
again
one
thing
i
would
like
to
mention
is
that
the
classification
which
plaintiffs
sought
to,
--
which
the
plaintiffs
represent
is
not
the
two-year
college
student
but
rather
a
four-year
college
student.
this
is
the
classification
which
they
established
in
their
pleadings
and
this
i
believe
is
the
issue
before
this
court.
also,
the
plaintiffs
indicated
the
course
of
study
which
would
have
required
a
period
of
time
far
in
excess
of
the
two
years.
omega
minor
will
finish
in
about
five-and-a-half
years
and
the
other
plaintiff
indicated
that
he
intended
to
go
on
for
a
period
of
four
years.
so
again,
the
point
is
here
that
in
a
technical
or
vocational
school,
not
only
is
it
more
likely
than
not
that
you
have
someone
who
does
not
have
a
high
school
degree,
and
therefore,
is
more
in
need
of
help
but
you
also
have
a
situation
where
the
state
can
provide
afdc
benefits
for
a
period
of
perhaps
four
months
to
a
year
and
be
assured
that
at
the
end
of
that
time
that
there
is
some
chance
that
the
recipient
will
no
longer
need
the
help
of
the
state.
but
going
at
to
the
point
again,
congress
has
said
every
time
that
has
amended
the
act,
the
states
are
free
to
either
expand
the
definition
or
not
expand
the
definition.
hew
has
defined
or
has
made
similar
statements,
they
have
set
forth
their
views
in
the
regulation
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
that
regulation,
they
have
said
that
a
state
is
free
to
--
they
have
said
specifically
in
their
brief
on
page
39
that
although
the
public
assistance
titles
to
find
the
coverage
in
which
the
federal
government
will
participate
financially,
a
state
may
provide
coverage
on
a
broader
or
more
limited
basis.
and
in
later
views
expressed
by
hew
and
by
congress,
we
believe
that
the
plaintiffs
are
asking
for
relief
which
both
congress
and
hew
has
thus
far
refused
to
grant.
for
this
court
to
grant
this
extended
coverage
would
be
contrary
to
the
principles
that
is
enunciated
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
in
the
statutory
construction
case,
its
function
is
not
to
implement
its
own
views,
but
rather
to
carry
out
the
will
of
congress
and
congress
has
manifested
its
will
that
the
states
are
free
to
do
this.
furthermore,
i
would
point
out
that
congress
can
grant
the
relief
which
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking,
by
passing
the
timely
assistance
act.
now,
the
difference
between
this
court
granting
the
relief
sought
by
the
plaintiffs
and
congress
achieving
the
same
result,
that
under
the
family
assistance
plan,
if
this
is
done,
if
aid
is
extended
to
those
in
colleges
or
universities
as
well
as
those
in
technical
or
vocational
schools,
under
the
act
as
it
stands
now,
the
federal
government
would
provide
additional
funds
other
than
what
it
now
provides.
of
course,
it
now
provides
funds
on
a
50-50
basis
under
a
portion
of
that
the
family
assistance
act,
it
would
fund
100%
as
opposed
to
50%.
i
believe
that
this
is
a
realization
by
congress
that
not
all
of
the
states
can
fully
implement
the
act
and
that
if
congress
wants
the
uniform
system
of
welfare
across
the
entire
nation
that
it
will
have
to
provide
additional
benefits.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
that
this
court
recognized
in
dandridge
that
eroding
employability
and
saving
funds
were
legitimate
state
ends.
the
appellee
submits
to
the
court
that
the
course
of
the
action
which
they
have
taken
is
rationally
related
to
each
of
these
two
ends.
the
state,
we
believe
has
made
a
reasonable
choice.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
constitution
requires
the
state
to
take
money
from
the
8-year-old,
the
9-year-old
and
the
10-year-old
to
take
part
of
those
benefits
and
share
those
benefits
for
the
20-year-old
basketball
player.
we
believe
that
the
other
class
is
more
needy.
the
state
has
helped
those
and
we
believe
that
the
state
has
acted
constitutionally.
for
these
reasons,
we
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first
point
out
that
although
afdc
benefits
were
cut-off
at
the
time
that
these
children
attended
a
college
or
university
that
they
were
provided
with
general
assistance
funds.
i
believe
the
issue
before
this
court
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
believe
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
or
the
supremacy
clause
requires
the
states
to
participate
fully
in
the
federal
afdc
program
regardless
of
their
financial
condition.
i
think
this
is
contrary
to
the
congressional
intent
which
provided
that
the
programs
would
be
implemented
or
that
financial
assistance
would
be
provided,
as
far
as
practicable
under
the
conditions
in
each
state.
i
think
it
is
somewhat
important
to
know
that
illinois'
involvement
in
this
case
is
not
because
that
it
has
cut
grants,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
illinois
provides
a
100%
of
need
or
not
because
that
it
has
established
any
strange
eligibility
requirements,
but
simply
because
it
adopted
a
classification
which
was
originally
established
by
congress
in
1964.
now,
prior
to
1964,
the
federal
definition
of
a
dependent
child
was
a
child
under
18.
then
in
1964,
congress
amended
the
definition
and
it
defined
a
dependent
child
as
someone
under
the
age
of
18
or
someone
under
the
age
of
21
who
is
attending
a
high
school
which
would
lead
--
a
high
school
course
of
study
which
would
lead
to
the
diploma
or
vocational
training
school
which
would
lead
to
gainful
employment.
at
the
time
that
congress
amended
its
definition
of
a
dependent
child,
illinois
similarly
amended
its
public
aid
code
to
provide
essentially
the
same
definition.
and
in
1965,
one
year
later,
congress
again
expanded
the
definition
but
unfortunately,
the
financial
conditions
in
state
of
illinois
and
the
nine
others
states
have
not
allowed
it
to
expand
the
definition.
although
congress
has
consistently,
since
1940,
recognized
that
the
state
does
not
have
to
expand
its
benefits
every
time
that
congress
expands
its
definition
of
a
dependent
child.
for
example,
in
1940,
the
age
limit
was
16
and
congress
raised
the
age
limit
of
a
dependent
child
from
16
to
18,
and
at
that
time
the
house
report
stated,
it
is
estimated
that
about
a
100,000
additional
children
may
obtain
the
aid
by
virtue
of
this
change
provided
all
states
amend
their
laws
accordingly.
this
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
on
page
36.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
think,
your
honor
that
if
the
state
adopts
a
classification
established
by
congress
that
here
is
the
right
and
congress,
i
think
has
expressly
recognized
the
fact
that
it
has
the
right
to
take
the
same
steps
as
are
established
by
congress.
i
think
that
if
it
adopts
the
same
requirements
that
congress
require,
the
same
requirements
that
congress
adopts,
it
is
acting
rationally.
and
again,
i
think
that
the
test
is
rationality
held
from
time
to
time
when
congress
has
expanded
the
definition
of
what
it
is
a
dependent
child.
for
example,
my
recollection
is
that
when
they
expanded
it
from
16
to
18,
there
was
a
requirement
that
they
would
be
in
school.
so
the
point
is,
is
that
congress
is
taken
this
step,
has
taken
this
approach
throughout
the
time
that
it
is
expanded
the
definition
from
time
to
time
as
it
expanded.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
at
the
time
that
they
first
made
the
classification,
it
was
vocational
and
technical
school.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
and
then
a
year
later,
it
was
expanded
to
include
kids
who
are
in
colleges
or
university.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true,
your
honor
but
at
the
same
time
that
they
did
that
and
at
all
times
that
they
have
expanded
that
definition,
they
have
made
it
clear
that
the
state
can
expand
it
if
the
financial
conditions
are
as
far
as
is
practical
under
the
laws
of
the
state.
i
believe
that
a
state
can
take
that
approach
as
long
as
there
is
a
rational
distinction
and
i
believe
that
there
is
a
rational
distinction
here
between
the
classification
which
congress
originally
set
up
in
1964
and
classification
which
is
later
adopted
in
1965.
i
was
referring
to
the
time
that
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
pardon
me?
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
i
think
that
under
the
history
of
social
security
act,
congress
has
recognized
the
fact
that
not
all
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
believe
you
do
get
a
diploma,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
well,
i
draw
that
distinction
because
of
the
fact
that
normally,
you
speak
of
the
diploma
in
terms
of
a
formal
type
educational
as
opposed
to
vocational
or
technical
type.
you
do
get
a
diploma
of
some
kind.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
is
recognition.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
congress
picked
up
this
category
in
the
first
place
in
1964
and
the
way
in
which
they
did
it.
i
think
that
it
was
a
realization
that
there
are
some
who
are
not
interested
in
a
high
school
course
of
the
action
in
formal
education
as
we
know
it.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true,
your
honor.
a
child
in
vocational
and
technical
school
and
a
child
in
high
school
and
that
is
exactly
my
point.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
it
changes
because
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
that
is
not
true,
your
honor.
the
point
that
i
am
make
is
that
if
the
state
of
illinois
had
a
$100
to
give
to
someone
and
it
had
to
take
its
choice
between
a
child
who
is
say
8-years-old
and
a
20-year-old
child,
that
is
true
that
under
the
definition
of
what
is
needy
and
i
might
point
out
that
someone
who
is
needy
may
be
a
22-year-old
or
23-year-old,
it
may
involve
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
--
any
particular
age.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
but
the
difference
is
they
have
the
same
needs
but
the
state
of
illinois
is
filled
in
a
different
way.
the
fact
is,
that
when
somebody
graduates
from
high
school
and
gets
a
high
school
diploma
and
enters
the
junior
college
or
a
college,
he
then
is
eligible
as
opposed
to
a
child
in
vocational
or
technical
school,
he
is
then
eligible
to
get
tuition
and
grants.
a
child
who
in
technical
or
vocational
school,
has
the
same
needs
but
he
is
not
eligible
because
in
most
cases,
he
does
not
have
a
high
school
diploma
and
that
is
the
key.
the
difference
between
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
under
the
illinois
scheme
of
providing
grants,
he
does
not
have
had
to
show
the
superior
capacity.
the
requirements
for
a
tuition
require
that
he
be
on
the
upper
half
of
his
class
and
that
he
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
neither
one
ever
applied
for
a
scholarship
or
a
grant.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
no,
they
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor,
the
grants
are
based
solely
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
if
they
applied
for
it,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
based
on
financial
needs,
grants
are
based
solely
on
financial
needs.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
if
they
are
a
high
school
graduate,
which
they
are.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
in
addition
of
the
scholarships,
there
are
also
grants
under
the
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
--
the
illinois
states
scholarship
commission,
this
was
established
in
1957.
now,
under
that
commission,
the
legislature
set
up
a
whole
series
of
scholarships,
grants
and
guaranteed
loans
which
were
designed
solely
for
financially
needy.
now,
a
child
--
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
for
schooling.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
in
addition
of
the
scholarship,
they
can
also
get
grants.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
your
honor
the
statute
is
silent
on
that.
i
attempted
to
find
out.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
i
understand
that
as
a
practical
matter
if
the
child
is
in
a
technical
or
vocational
school
and
he
is
expected
to
pay
tuition
for
example,
which
may
be
$850
or
$900,
as
a
practical
matter,
he
is
in
approximately
the
same
position
as
somebody
who
is
attending
a
college,
who
is
getting
a
grant
to
cover
expenses
at
a
college,
but
is
not
getting
the
living
expenses.
we
have
provided
--
state
of
illinois
has
provided
aid
in
two
different
areas,
but
essentially,
they
have
equalized
the
conditions.
the
point
that
i
am
attempting
to
make
is
that
if
the
state
of
illinois
had
a
$100
to
give
and
it
had
a
choice
between
an
8-year-old
child
and
a
20-year-old
child,
now
both
of
them
could
fall
within
the
technical
definition
of
what
is
a
needy
child
in
the
sense
that
they
are
making
less
than
the
standard
of
need.
but
the
fact
remains
that
if
we
assume
that
illinois
has
$100
and
it
chooses
to
give
it
to
the
8-year-old,
i
do
not
think
it
could
be
said
to
be
arbitrary
that
it
chose
to
give
that
$100.00
to
the
8-year-old
as
opposed
to
20-year-old.
the
point
being
that
even
among
those
who
are
technically
classified
as
needy,
there
are
some
who
are
more
in
the
need
of
help
than
others.
the
point
is
that
here,
those
who
are
in
technical
or
vocational
school,
although,
they
are
technically
as
needy
as
somebody
who
is
in
a
college
or
university,
those
children
are
still
less
in
need
of
number
one
because
it
is
more
likely
than
not
the
kid
in
the
technical
or
vocational
school
does
not
have
a
high
school
degree
which
means
that
he
has
no
choice,
he
cannot
get
into
a
college
or
university.
he
can
only
get
into
a
technical
school.
secondly,
he
is
not
in
as
much
need
because
of
the
fact
that
when
he
gets
that
high
school
degree,
when
he
gets
into
a
college
or
university,
he
is
then
available
for
this
tuition
which
of
course,
would
not
apply
in
the
case
of
a
junior
college
and
the
grants
in
the
guaranteed
loans
and
especially
the
grant.
so
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
child
who
is
in
a
technical
or
vocational
school,
educationally
under
most
state
is
at
a
distinct
disadvantage
because
of
the
fact
that
he
cannot
get
the
same
assistance.
and
again
the
point
is,
that
a
child,
their
high
school
degree
does
mark
the
difference
between
a
child
who
is
more
in
need
of
help
than
the
other
child.
and
again,
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
the
fact
that
in
1965,
now
when
congress
established
and
expanded
the
definition,
at
that
time,
it
pointed
out
and
this
is
contained
on
pages
36
and
37
of
our
brief
that
under
existing
laws,
states
at
their
option
may
continue
payments
and
then
the
senatorial
committee
report
went
on
to
say
federal
sharing
for
this
purpose
would
thus
be
available
to
states
who
implement
such
a
program,
for
payments
to
children
regularly
attending
a
college
or
university
as
well
as
those
attending
high
school
or
vocational
school.
but
congress
has
made
it
clear
that
the
states
can
as
finances
allow
develop
the
program
as
long
as
there
is
a
rational
choice
and
again,
i
believe
that
there
is
a
rational
choice.
counsel
was
candid
enough
to
admit
that
we
are
talking
about
not
only
post-education,
post-high
school
education
but
also
the
equivalent
and
for
time
that
congress
originally
established
this
classification,
if
you
examine
the
classification
as
they
set
up,
they
spoke
in
terms
of
someone
who
is
attending
a
high
school
and
the
course
of
study
which
would
lead
to
a
degree
or
vocational
or
technical
school
which
would
lead
the
gainful
employment.
i
think
the
point
is
that
congress
at
this
time
realized
the
fact
that
not
everyone
that
the
state
was
concerned
with
that
not
everyone
that
congress
was
concerned
about
was
somebody
who
would
want
to
go
back
in
high
school
and
get
a
degree.
i
think
it
was
concerned
about
the
kid
who
drops
out
of
high
school
and
finds
that
he
has
no
aptitude
for
it
and
desires
instead
to
go
to
a
vocational
or
technical
school.
but
i
think
that
we
are
not
talking
about
the
same
class
of
kids.
i
think
that
the
principles
of
this
court
has
enunciated
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
the
state
can
attack
as
much
of
a
problem
as
its
finances
allow.
now,
no
discussion
would
be
complete
without
a
picture
of
the
situation
in
illinois
that
exists
now
because
of
a
substantial
increase,
applied
full
increase
in
the
afdc
cases,
governor
ogilvie
announced
that
there
is
a
$108
million
overall
deficit
in
the
welfare
programs
and
specifically
$107
million
deficit
in
state
funds.
now,
the
governor
was
faced
with
either
cutting
grants
and
in
the
report
which
he
submit
in
october
1971,
he
spoke
in
terms
of
one-third
cut
in
the
standard
of
need
as
opposed
to
a
100%,
giving
a
100%
standard
of
need
they
would
mean
roughly
67
or
70%
standard
of
need.
in
an
attempt
to
alleviate
this
problem,
what
he
did
was
he
transferred
funds
from
the
general
assistance
funds,
general
assistance
fund
which
is
truly
a
state
program
into
afdc,
he
transferred
$21
million
and
this
is
then
met
the
afdc
budget.
now,
litigation
resulted
and
as
of
this
time,
the
governor
has
been
enjoined
from
carrying
out
this
program.
but
the
point
is
that
at
this
time,
there
is
a
possibility
of
cutting
the
standard
of
need
in
afdc
cases.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
constitution
requires
the
state
of
illinois
to
take
the
money,
assuming
that
this
is
the
condition,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
constitution
requires
the
state
of
illinois
to
take
money
from
the
8-year-old
and
the
9-year-old
and
the
10-year-old
and
give
it
to
a
20-year-old
basketball
player.
we
believe
that
we
have
helped
those
who
are
most
in
need
under
illinois
law,
namely
those
without
the
high
school
degree,
those
who
say
in
a
period
of
a
short
time
could
become
employable
within
one
employable
report,
we
believe
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
acted
rationally.
we
believe
that
congress
has
realized
every
time
that
it
has
expanded
the
definition.
from
1940
on
they
have
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
states
were
free
to
either
adopt
the
amendments
to
expand
the
programs
or
not
to.
hew,
the
administrative
body
which
administers
the
act
is
here
before
this
court.
they
filed
an
amicus
curiae
brief.
they
have
taken
the
position
that
the
states
are
free
to
implement
a
program
as
its
finances
allow.
in
light
of
the
views
that
congress
has
expressed,
the
states
are
free
to
either
expand
their
programs
or
not
expand
their
programs
and
again
as
was
pointed
out,
there
are
substantial
number
of
states
which
do
not
comply
100%
with
the
federal
program
which
have
not
expanded
the
federal
program.
mr.
donald
j.
veverka
it
depends
on
the
course
and
the
appendix
which
i
had
support
in
my
brief.
i
took
the
chicago
area
of
vocational
schools
and
i
listed
the
course
and
their
lengths
of
time.
in
addition
to
that,
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
that
the
report
of
the
--
it
was
by
house
committee
on
education
and
they
found
that,
it
was
a
republican
task
force
on
education
and
they
found
that
the
average
length
of
a
vocational
school
was
with
approximately
four
months
to
a
year
which
is
another
point.
if
somebody
attends
a
junior
college,
we
are
talking
essentially
about
a
two-year
program
and
again
one
thing
i
would
like
to
mention
is
that
the
classification
which
plaintiffs
sought
to,
--
which
the
plaintiffs
represent
is
not
the
two-year
college
student
but
rather
a
four-year
college
student.
this
is
the
classification
which
they
established
in
their
pleadings
and
this
i
believe
is
the
issue
before
this
court.
also,
the
plaintiffs
indicated
the
course
of
study
which
would
have
required
a
period
of
time
far
in
excess
of
the
two
years.
omega
minor
will
finish
in
about
five-and-a-half
years
and
the
other
plaintiff
indicated
that
he
intended
to
go
on
for
a
period
of
four
years.
so
again,
the
point
is
here
that
in
a
technical
or
vocational
school,
not
only
is
it
more
likely
than
not
that
you
have
someone
who
does
not
have
a
high
school
degree,
and
therefore,
is
more
in
need
of
help
but
you
also
have
a
situation
where
the
state
can
provide
afdc
benefits
for
a
period
of
perhaps
four
months
to
a
year
and
be
assured
that
at
the
end
of
that
time
that
there
is
some
chance
that
the
recipient
will
no
longer
need
the
help
of
the
state.
but
going
at
to
the
point
again,
congress
has
said
every
time
that
has
amended
the
act,
the
states
are
free
to
either
expand
the
definition
or
not
expand
the
definition.
hew
has
defined
or
has
made
similar
statements,
they
have
set
forth
their
views
in
the
regulation
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
that
regulation,
they
have
said
that
a
state
is
free
to
--
they
have
said
specifically
in
their
brief
on
page
39
that
although
the
public
assistance
titles
to
find
the
coverage
in
which
the
federal
government
will
participate
financially,
a
state
may
provide
coverage
on
a
broader
or
more
limited
basis.
and
in
later
views
expressed
by
hew
and
by
congress,
we
believe
that
the
plaintiffs
are
asking
for
relief
which
both
congress
and
hew
has
thus
far
refused
to
grant.
for
this
court
to
grant
this
extended
coverage
would
be
contrary
to
the
principles
that
is
enunciated
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
in
the
statutory
construction
case,
its
function
is
not
to
implement
its
own
views,
but
rather
to
carry
out
the
will
of
congress
and
congress
has
manifested
its
will
that
the
states
are
free
to
do
this.
furthermore,
i
would
point
out
that
congress
can
grant
the
relief
which
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking,
by
passing
the
timely
assistance
act.
now,
the
difference
between
this
court
granting
the
relief
sought
by
the
plaintiffs
and
congress
achieving
the
same
result,
that
under
the
family
assistance
plan,
if
this
is
done,
if
aid
is
extended
to
those
in
colleges
or
universities
as
well
as
those
in
technical
or
vocational
schools,
under
the
act
as
it
stands
now,
the
federal
government
would
provide
additional
funds
other
than
what
it
now
provides.
of
course,
it
now
provides
funds
on
a
50-50
basis
under
a
portion
of
that
the
family
assistance
act,
it
would
fund
100%
as
opposed
to
50%.
i
believe
that
this
is
a
realization
by
congress
that
not
all
of
the
states
can
fully
implement
the
act
and
that
if
congress
wants
the
uniform
system
of
welfare
across
the
entire
nation
that
it
will
have
to
provide
additional
benefits.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
that
this
court
recognized
in
dandridge
that
eroding
employability
and
saving
funds
were
legitimate
state
ends.
the
appellee
submits
to
the
court
that
the
course
of
the
action
which
they
have
taken
is
rationally
related
to
each
of
these
two
ends.
the
state,
we
believe
has
made
a
reasonable
choice.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
constitution
requires
the
state
to
take
money
from
the
8-year-old,
the
9-year-old
and
the
10-year-old
to
take
part
of
those
benefits
and
share
those
benefits
for
the
20-year-old
basketball
player.
we
believe
that
the
other
class
is
more
needy.
the
state
has
helped
those
and
we
believe
that
the
state
has
acted
constitutionally.
for
these
reasons,
we
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
