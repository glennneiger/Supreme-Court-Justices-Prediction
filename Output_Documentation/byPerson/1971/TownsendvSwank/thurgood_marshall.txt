(inaudible)
why
you
draw
this
line?
justice
thurgood
marshall
between
the
vocational,
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
you
go
to
high
school,
then
you
come
out
with
a
diploma
and
you
go
to
vocation
school,
you
come
out
with
a
job,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
number
one,
do
you
get
a
diploma
out
of
vocational
high
school
or
not
or
illinois
is
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
do
you
draw
the
difference?
you
say
one,
you
get
a
diploma
and
the
other
you
get
a
job?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
think
there
is
a
deputy
in
mit
and
all
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
just
true
that
you
want
these
poor
people
just
to
be
limited
to
jobs
that
are
trained
skills,
is
that
what
you
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
want
to
preclude
liberal
arts
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
get
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let
me
ask
this?
does
a
child
in
vocational
school
eat
less
food
than
a
child
in
a
high
school?
do
they
not
eat
the
same
food?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
they
not
wear
the
same
clothes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
do
they
not
have
the
same
needs,
exact
same
needs?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
the
child
in
college
has
the
same
problem?
where
do
they
changes
so
suddenly?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
your
theory
that
a
poor
child
does
not
need
a
college
education?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
not
dealing
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
dealing
with
two
children
that
are
eighteen-and-a-half-years-old.
one
of
them
is
in
a
vocational
school
and
the
other
is
in
first
year
college.
one
of
them
needs
to
eat
and
the
other
one
does
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
to
add
another
one,
they
are
both
eighteen-and-a-half,
and
one
of
them
is
in
technical
school
and
the
other
has
graduated
from
high
school
but
he
just
barely
made
it,
and
he
is
not
capable
of
any
scholarship
aid.
what
happens
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
the
children
here
get
any
tuition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
the
named
appellants
in
this
case
are
getting
tuition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
did
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
they
got
it
automatically.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
would
automatically
get
scholarship
aid?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
question
here,
they
need
financing.
they
meet
the
requirements.
so
you
say
all
they
have
to
do
is
right
now
for
a
grant,
to
apply
for
the
scholarship
aid
and
they
will
get
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
understand
that
this
school
here,
they
do
not
require
it,
they
do
not
pay
tuition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
does
that
tuition
help
them?
how
does
scholarship
help
them
in
a
school
that
does
not
have
tuition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
grant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
for
the
course
of
schooling
or
course
at
home?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
understand
they
do
not
need
and
they
do
not
need
to
pay
for
their
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
grant?
you
mean,
they
need
grant
for
clothes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
