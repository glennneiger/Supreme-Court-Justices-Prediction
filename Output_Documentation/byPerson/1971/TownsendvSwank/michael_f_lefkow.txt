mr.

f.

mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
illinois
makes
payments
under
its
federally
subsidized
program
of
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children,
to
needy
dependent
children
between
the
ages
of
18
to
21
years
old,
attending
a
vocational
or
technical
training
school,
but
denies
payments
to
children
attending
a
junior
college,
a
college
or
a
university.
the
issue
in
this
case,
is
whether
the
discrimination
is
inconsistent
with
the
requirements
and
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mrs.
georgia
townsend
and
her
daughter
omega
were
a
family
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
omega
was
a
dependent
child,
but
they
were
cut-off
and
denied
any
aid
under
the
afdc
program
while
they
met
all
the
requirements,
specified
by
congress.
appellant's
rely
on
this
court's
decision
in
king
versus
smith
which
invalidated
alabama
scheme
of
absolute
disqualification
of
eligible
children
on
the
fiction
that
they
had
a
substitute
father.
there,
alabama
defined
parent
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
act
and
with
its
purposes.
illinois
likewise,
has
defined
dependent
children
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
act
and
its
purposes,
by
totally
excluding
from
afdc
benefits,
children
attending
a
college
or
university.
we
believe
that
king
clearly
prohibits
the
illinois'
absolute
disqualification.
a
reading
of
king
requires
an
interpretation
of
the
definitional
section
for
section
406
(a)
that
it
is
mandatory
upon
the
state
of
illinois
to
provide
some
aid
to
all
those
defined
by
congress
as
dependent
children.
this
requirement
on
the
states
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
dandridge
versus
williams.
that
in
order
to
avoid
violating
the
statute
itself,
a
state
must
provide
some
aid
to
all
eligible
families
and
all
eligible
children.
now,
we
submit
that
in
addition
to
these
two
cases,
there
are
a
number
of
other
important
reasons
why
this
statute
is
mandatory.
one
is
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
another,
is
necessary
to
make
a
mandatory
to
avoid
frustrating
the
purposes
of
the
act.
it
is
necessary
for
harmonious
construction
of
the
federal
statutory
scheme.
it
is
necessary
because
of
the
legislative
history.
it
is
necessary
to
avoid
an
equal
protection
violation
and
it
is
necessary
to
prevent
illinois
from
withdrawing
from
this
part
of
the
afdc
program.
i
will
return
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
state
has
asserted
that
it
had
discretion
whether
it
wants
to
adopt
the
definitional
section
of
406
(a).
we
submit
that
there
is
--
the
plain
wording
of
the
statute
grants
the
state
no
discretion.
a
similar
section,
section
407,
would
on
its
face
grant
the
state
discretion
to
participate
in
the
unemployed
or
underemployed
program
which
was
added
to
the
act
in
1961.
and
this
court
has
stated
in
king
versus
smith
that
that
particular
section
407
is
optional
with
the
state,
but
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
statute
in
406
(a)
to
indicate
that
the
state
has
discretion
to
pick
and
choose
among
the
children
made
eligible
by
congress.
we
submit
that
the
legal
standard
for
testing
a
state’s
compliance
is
the
act
itself.
next,
it
is
necessary
to
make
it
mandatory
to
avoid
frustrating
the
purposes
of
the
act.
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
interpreted
by
this
court
in
king,
is
for
the
protection
of
dependent
children.
that
is
the
paramount
goal
and
congress
in
1964,
in
amending
the
social
security
act,
stated
that
the
assumption
that
children
are
no
longer
dependent,
is
not
valid
as
applied
to
children
still
attending
school.
further,
by
denying
these
children
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
they
will
not
be
eligible,
your
honor,
because
congress
did
not
make
them
eligible.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
in
terms
of
the
equal
protection,
it
is
if
you
distinguish
between
children
attending
a
vocational
or
technical
school
and
those
attending
a
college
or
university
up
to
the
age
21.
in
determining
violation
of
the
equal
protection,
you
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
the
purpose
of
this
act
is
to
provide
afdc
sustenance
benefits
up
to
age
21.
so
measured
in
terms
of
purpose
of
the
act,
a
denial
to
college
and
university
students
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
because
we
submit
that
there
is
simply
no
rational
basis
for
what
the
state
has
done
by
saying
that
if
much
it
says
over
the
door
of
the
school
to
technical
or
vocational
school,
we
are
not
going
to
grant
these
children
aid
in
spite
of
the
fact,
that
much
technical
or
vocational
education
is
provided
in
junior
colleges,
colleges
and
universities.
in
fact,
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
federal
government
fund
junior
colleges
in
illinois
to
the
tune
of
$
6.5
million
a
year
to
provide
technical
or
vocational
education
and
these
children
are
excluded
from
participating
in
that
because
they
do
not
have
the
money
to
have
the
food
and
the
clothing
and
the
shelter
they
need,
so
they
can
attend
these
schools.
we
would
further
point
out
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
yes,
your
honor
that
would
be
our
position.
because
all
afdc
does,
your
honor,
is
provide,
bring
a
person
up
to
a
minimal
living
level
so
that
they
have
enough
money
to
subsist
on
for
food,
for
clothing
and
for
shelter.
it
does
not
provide
any
additional
benefits.
although
i
will
point
out
that
in
this
case,
the
child
that
has
been
in
a
technical
or
vocational
school,
the
state
of
illinois
will
pay
a
substantial
tuition
to
these
private
schools.
but,
and
this
education,
same
education
is
available
in
a
junior
college.
in
effect
the
taxpayer
is
paying
twice
by
illinois'
arbitrary
distinction
between
by
having
the
over
the
door
requirement,
so
that
is
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
she
did
go
to
school,
your
honor
and
she
is
in
school
today.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
yes,
your
honor
that
is
what
afdc
eligibility
is.
it
provides
money
for
sustenance
benefits.
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
she
and
her
mother
had
been
forced
to
live
at
an
intolerable
level
of
existence.
her
mother
is
a
very
sick
woman,
suffering
from
systemic
erythematosus.
they
live
on
about
15
cents
a
meal.
they
have
no
--
hardly
any
furniture
in
their
house.
they
are
suffering
terribly
and
no
child
should
have
to
go
through
that
in
order
to
obtain
an
education
and
that
is
what
congress
meant
by
making
sure
that
the
sustenance
benefits
would
be
available
for
them.
and
i
would
further
like
to
point
out
that
what
illinois
has
done
is
pause
on
this
allocation
of
federal
resources,
congress
has
determined
that
federal
funds
should
not
flow
to
these
children.
but
illinois
has
prohibited
that
and
has
unduly
limited
the
welfare
rules
in
illinois
by
approximately
a
thousand
children
a
year,
who
may
want
take
advantage
of
this
provision.
i
further
like
to
point
out
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
shows
that
congress
has
continually
expanded
eligibility
to
meet
rising
educational
requirements
and
opportunity
as
they
become
available
in
our
society.
in
1935,
the
child
had
to
be
under
age
of
16.
in
1939,
congress
amended
it
to
under
16
or
under
age
18,
if
the
state
determines
the
child
is
in
school.
in
1956,
congress
lifted
the
school
age
requirement.
in
1964,
they
reinforced
the
school
age
requirement
and
in
1965,
they
added
the
college
and
university
so
that
the
child
could
be
attending
in
effect
any
school.
as
long
as
he
is
attending
any
type
of
school
in
pursuit
of
an
education
between
18
and
21,
he
would
be
eligible
for
these
benefits.
we
would
further
like
to
point
out
that
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
hold
that
this
section
406
(a)
is
mandatory
because
the
section
itself
says,
when
used
in
this
part,
part
(a)
which
is
title
iv
of
the
social
security
act,
these
definitions
are
used
throughout
the
whole
title
of
the
act
and
section
402
(a)
(10)
which
requires
the
aid
to
be
furnished
with
reasonable
promptness
combined
with
section
406
(a)
clearly
mandates
this
child
should
receive
some
aid.
in
king
versus
smith,
the
court
said
in
combination
of
these
two
sections
clearly
require
that
some
aid
be
furnished.
in
dandridge
versus
williams,
this
court
held
that
a
state
may
allocate
among
those
who
are
already
on
the
rolls,
but
it
must
provide
some
aid
to
all
eligible
families
and
all
eligible
individuals.
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
court’s
opinion,
dandridge,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
that
the
one
thing
everybody
has
agreed
on,
is
that
congress
fixes
the
federal
eligibility
requirements.
that
it
was
congress
to
determine
who
is
dependent
and
the
states
are
allowed
to
determine
who
is
needy.
the
states
have
ample
opportunity
to
protect
themselves
from
adverse
fiscal
impact
under
this
court’s
decision
in
rosado,
allowing
percentage
reductions
and
in
dandridge
allowing
the
imposition
of
maximum
grants.
so
there
is
no
--
the
state
of
illinois
need
to
suffer
no
harm
by
a
reversal
of
this
opinion.
in
an
effect,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
reply
brief,
the
fiscal
effect
on
the
state
of
illinois
would
be
minimal.
it
would
be
approximately
$500,000.00
a
year
and
the
federal
government
would
point,
put
up
the
$500,000.00
a
year
making
a
total
of
approximately
$1
million.
we
would
also
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
state’s
purpose
of
encouraging
employability
which
the
state
and
the
court
below
has
a
whole
purpose
of
the
state
statute
denying
assistance
to
college
and
university
children,
was
to
encourage
employability.
but
we
will
submit
that
rationale
under
this
court’s
decision
in
shapiro
is
not
permissible
or
not
logical.
in
shapiro,
the
court
said
that,
encouraging
employability
was
no
justification
for
imposing
one
year
residency
requirement.
that
if
you
are
going
to
impose
that
type
of
requirement,
you
would
have
to
impose
that
not
just
on
the
ones
who
moved
to
new
residence,
moving
into
the
state,
but
all
the
residence
and
we
submit
the
same
type
of
logic
applies
in
this
case.
that
if
you
are
going
to
require
a
child
to
go
to
work
just
because
he
is
in
college
and
university,
it
is
only
fair
then
for
technical
or
vocational
schools,
that
same
standard
to
be
applied.
however,
i
want
to
point
out
that
hew
has
clearly
prohibited
working
requirements
while
the
children
are
attending
school
between
the
ages
of
18
and
21.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
is
still
mandatory.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
state
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
no,
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
alright,
what
is
your
question
then,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
i
do
not
know,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
yes.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
not
in
terms
of
this
case,
your
honor.
in
another
words,
the
college
and
university
students
with
children
over
age
18,
there
would
not
be
a
denial.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
that
is
right!
but
you
see,
in
this
case
congress
has
made
a
determination.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
i
see.
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
i
would
like
to
reserve
two
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the

not
believe
that
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
in
terms
of
the
equal
protection,
it
is
if
you
distinguish
between
children
attending
a
vocational
or
technical
school
and
those
attending
a
college
or
university
up
to
the
age
21.
in
determining
violation
of
the
equal
protection,
you
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
the
purpose
of
this
act
is
to
provide
afdc
sustenance
benefits
up
to
age
21.
so
measured
in
terms
of
purpose
of
the
act,
a
denial
to
college
and
university
students
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
because
we
submit
that
there
is
simply
no
rational
basis
for
what
the
state
has
done
by
saying
that
if
much
it
says
over
the
door
of
the
school
to
technical
or
vocational
school,
we
are
not
going
to
grant
these
children
aid
in
spite
of
the
fact,
that
much
technical
or
vocational
education
is
provided
in
junior
colleges,
colleges
and
universities.
in
fact,
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
federal
government
fund
junior
colleges
in
illinois
to
the
tune
of
$
6.5
million
a
year
to
provide
technical
or
vocational
education
and
these
children
are
excluded
from
participating
in
that
because
they
do
not
have
the
money
to
have
the
food
and
the
clothing
and
the
shelter
they
need,
so
they
can
attend
these
schools.
we
would
further
point
out
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
yes,
your
honor
that
would
be
our
position.
because
all
afdc
does,
your
honor,
is
provide,
bring
a
person
up
to
a
minimal
living
level
so
that
they
have
enough
money
to
subsist
on
for
food,
for
clothing
and
for
shelter.
it
does
not
provide
any
additional
benefits.
although
i
will
point
out
that
in
this
case,
the
child
that
has
been
in
a
technical
or
vocational
school,
the
state
of
illinois
will
pay
a
substantial
tuition
to
these
private
schools.
but,
and
this
education,
same
education
is
available
in
a
junior
college.
in
effect
the
taxpayer
is
paying
twice
by
illinois'
arbitrary
distinction
between
by
having
the
over
the
door
requirement,
so
that
is
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
she
did
go
to
school,
your
honor
and
she
is
in
school
today.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
yes,
your
honor
that
is
what
afdc
eligibility
is.
it
provides
money
for
sustenance
benefits.
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
she
and
her
mother
had
been
forced
to
live
at
an
intolerable
level
of
existence.
her
mother
is
a
very
sick
woman,
suffering
from
systemic
erythematosus.
they
live
on
about
15
cents
a
meal.
they
have
no
--
hardly
any
furniture
in
their
house.
they
are
suffering
terribly
and
no
child
should
have
to
go
through
that
in
order
to
obtain
an
education
and
that
is
what
congress
meant
by
making
sure
that
the
sustenance
benefits
would
be
available
for
them.
and
i
would
further
like
to
point
out
that
what
illinois
has
done
is
pause
on
this
allocation
of
federal
resources,
congress
has
determined
that
federal
funds
should
not
flow
to
these
children.
but
illinois
has
prohibited
that
and
has
unduly
limited
the
welfare
rules
in
illinois
by
approximately
a
thousand
children
a
year,
who
may
want
take
advantage
of
this
provision.
i
further
like
to
point
out
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
shows
that
congress
has
continually
expanded
eligibility
to
meet
rising
educational
requirements
and
opportunity
as
they
become
available
in
our
society.
in
1935,
the
child
had
to
be
under
age
of
16.
in
1939,
congress
amended
it
to
under
16
or
under
age
18,
if
the
state
determines
the
child
is
in
school.
in
1956,
congress
lifted
the
school
age
requirement.
in
1964,
they
reinforced
the
school
age
requirement
and
in
1965,
they
added
the
college
and
university
so
that
the
child
could
be
attending
in
effect
any
school.
as
long
as
he
is
attending
any
type
of
school
in
pursuit
of
an
education
between
18
and
21,
he
would
be
eligible
for
these
benefits.
we
would
further
like
to
point
out
that
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
hold
that
this
section
406
(a)
is
mandatory
because
the
section
itself
says,
when
used
in
this
part,
part
(a)
which
is
title
iv
of
the
social
security
act,
these
definitions
are
used
throughout
the
whole
title
of
the
act
and
section
402
(a)
(10)
which
requires
the
aid
to
be
furnished
with
reasonable
promptness
combined
with
section
406
(a)
clearly
mandates
this
child
should
receive
some
aid.
in
king
versus
smith,
the
court
said
in
combination
of
these
two
sections
clearly
require
that
some
aid
be
furnished.
in
dandridge
versus
williams,
this
court
held
that
a
state
may
allocate
among
those
who
are
already
on
the
rolls,
but
it
must
provide
some
aid
to
all
eligible
families
and
all
eligible
individuals.
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
court’s
opinion,
dandridge,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
that
the
one
thing
everybody
has
agreed
on,
is
that
congress
fixes
the
federal
eligibility
requirements.
that
it
was
congress
to
determine
who
is
dependent
and
the
states
are
allowed
to
determine
who
is
needy.
the
states
have
ample
opportunity
to
protect
themselves
from
adverse
fiscal
impact
under
this
court’s
decision
in
rosado,
allowing
percentage
reductions
and
in
dandridge
allowing
the
imposition
of
maximum
grants.
so
there
is
no
--
the
state
of
illinois
need
to
suffer
no
harm
by
a
reversal
of
this
opinion.
in
an
effect,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
reply
brief,
the
fiscal
effect
on
the
state
of
illinois
would
be
minimal.
it
would
be
approximately
$500,000.00
a
year
and
the
federal
government
would
point,
put
up
the
$500,000.00
a
year
making
a
total
of
approximately
$1
million.
we
would
also
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
state’s
purpose
of
encouraging
employability
which
the
state
and
the
court
below
has
a
whole
purpose
of
the
state
statute
denying
assistance
to
college
and
university
children,
was
to
encourage
employability.
but
we
will
submit
that
rationale
under
this
court’s
decision
in
shapiro
is
not
permissible
or
not
logical.
in
shapiro,
the
court
said
that,
encouraging
employability
was
no
justification
for
imposing
one
year
residency
requirement.
that
if
you
are
going
to
impose
that
type
of
requirement,
you
would
have
to
impose
that
not
just
on
the
ones
who
moved
to
new
residence,
moving
into
the
state,
but
all
the
residence
and
we
submit
the
same
type
of
logic
applies
in
this
case.
that
if
you
are
going
to
require
a
child
to
go
to
work
just
because
he
is
in
college
and
university,
it
is
only
fair
then
for
technical
or
vocational
schools,
that
same
standard
to
be
applied.
however,
i
want
to
point
out
that
hew
has
clearly
prohibited
working
requirements
while
the
children
are
attending
school
between
the
ages
of
18
and
21.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
is
still
mandatory.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
state
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
no,
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
alright,
what
is
your
question
then,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
i
do
not
know,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
yes.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
not
in
terms
of
this
case,
your
honor.
in
another
words,
the
college
and
university
students
with
children
over
age
18,
there
would
not
be
a
denial.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
that
is
right!
but
you
see,
in
this
case
congress
has
made
a
determination.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
i
see.
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
i
would
like
to
reserve
two
minutes
for
rebuttal.
