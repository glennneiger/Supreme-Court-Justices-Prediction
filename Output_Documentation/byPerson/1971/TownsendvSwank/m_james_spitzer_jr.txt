mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
begin
with
the
statutory
argument
and
i
should
like
to
address
initially.
i
should
submit
that
in
viewing
the
statutory
argument,
one
has
to
look
at
it
in
the
framework
of
the
afdc
program.
that
illinois,
in
excluding
college
children
from
the
definition
of
dependent
children,
but
including
other
forms
of
post-secondary
education,
that
is
post-secondary
vocational
education,
has
done
something
which
has
the
unfortunate
effect
of
perpetuating
poverty
which
is
clearly
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
uniformly,
no
sir.
but
it
is
both
post-secondary
and
not
post-secondary.
they
do
--
illinois
definitely
does
provide
post-secondary
vocational
training.
in
those
instances
where
children
did
not
attend
college,
however,
i
am
including
here
the
junior
colleges,
public
community
colleges,
because
both
of
the
named
appellants
here
did
attend
public
community
colleges.
these
colleges
are
the
only
free
schools
that
i
know
of
in
the
state
of
illinois.
the
vocational
institutes,
the
technical
institutes
that
are
included
in
the
appendix
to
the
appellee’s
brief,
are
all
tuition
paying
institutions
with
the
tuition
payments
of
up
to
$3,800.00.
i
should
emphasize
here,
that
we
do
not
suggest
or
intimate
that
there
is
a
requirement
to
pay
tuition.
though
in
fact,
illinois
does
under
some
circumstances.
in
this
case,
the
children
involved,
the
appellants,
the
named
appellants
were
attending
free
schools
supported
by
state
and
federal
moneys.
all
that
is
involved
here
is
their
basic
subsistence
grant.
i
say
all
that
is
involved
here,
but
obviously
that
grant
covers
their
food,
which
they
need
to
eat,
shelter
and
clothing,
the
real
essentials
of
life.
it
should
not
be
against
it.
we
differ
slightly
with
the
position
of
the
other
appellants
in
this
case
on
the
statutorily
argument.
it
is
not
our
position
that
the
definition
is
mandatory
in
every
instance.
we
recognize
that
congress
has
in
certain
instances,
indicated
very
clearly
and
unmistakably,
at
least
in
my
judgment,
that
the
program
was
intended
to
be
optional
and
the
states
were
to
have
a
choice
of
either
going
into
it
or
not
going
into
it.
an
example
of
this
is
involved
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
extension
of
the
18
to
21-year-old
group,
was
in
my
judgment
clearly
optional
that
the
senate
report
stated
under
existing
law,
states
at
their
option
may
continue
payments
to
needy
children
up
to
age
21
in
the
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
program.
then
it
goes
on,
however,
providing
they
are
regularly
attending
a
high
school
in
pursuance
of
a
course
of
study,
leading
to
a
high
school
diploma
or
its
equivalent.
the
committee
added
an
amendment
extending
this
provision,
referring
to
the
educational
requirement
provision,
so
as
to
include
needy
children
under
21
who
are
regularly
attending
a
school,
college
or
university.
in
other
words,
the
program
which
is
optional
is
the
extension
of
afdc
to
the
age
18
to
21-year-old
group,
but
the
educational
requirement
provision
is
different
and
that
was
instituted
according
to
the
report
which
was
deleted
from
the
references
by
the
solicitor
general
and
the
appellees
in
their
brief.
it
is
included
in
our
original
brief
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
9
that
the
educational
requirement
provision
and
the
extension
of
college
students
was
to
bring
the
educational
requirements
more
nearly
in
line
with
the
provision
of
the
bill
relating
to
the
continuation
of
a
child's
benefits
under
the
oasdi
system
which
is
mandatory.
then
it
goes
on;
the
objective
of
the
provision,
that
is
the
educational
requirement
provision
and
the
amendment
to
include
colleges
is
to
assure
as
far
as
possible
that
children
will
not
be
prevented
from
going
to
school
or
college
because
they
are
deprived
of
parental
support.
in
the
solicitor
general’s
brief,
the
solicitor
general
states,
that
the
department
referring
to
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare,
believes
that
the
omission
of
college
children
from
afdc
may
have
the
unfortunate
effect
of
perpetuating
poverty.
that
in
viewing
the
statute,
one
must
be
view
it,
in
terms
of
its
purposes
and
in
terms
of
its
structure
and
we
submit
that
under
both
standards,
it
requires
reading
this
provision
as
being
mandatory.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
this
is
the
old
age
survivor’s
benefits
and
social
security
act
also.
these
are
the
payments
where
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
no,
it
is
not,
but
the
reason
why
i
mentioned
and
it
is
included
in
the
committee
report
and
these
provisions
were
done
in
tandem,
that
congress
evinced
a
clear
purpose
to
make
the
provisions
as
nearly
alike
as
possible.
that
the
college
requirement’s
provision
was
added
to
afdc
because
it
was
done
in
oasdi
and
they
wanted
to
make
the
two
as
nearly
as
like
as
possible
and
that
is
the
only
reason
why
i
mention
that.
no,
it
is
not
directly
involved
in
this
case
though.
as
soon
as
the
bill
was
passed
and
completely
in
line
with
the
solicitor
general
statement
that
it
will
have
the
unfortunate
effect
of
perpetuating
poverty
and
in
line
with
the
senate
report,
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
in
its
handbook
interpreted
this
and
they
state
that
within
the
age
limit
set
by
the
state;
this
is
at
page
5
of
our
brief,
within
the
age
limit
set
by
the
state,
there
should
be
a
choice
of
attending
a
school,
college
or
university
or
taking
a
course
of
vocational
or
technical
training
for
gainful
employment.
i
think,
it
is
very,
very
important
to
recognize
here,
the
educational
structure
in
illinois
as
such
that
vocational
training
and
one
of
the
chief
weapons
used
in
order
to
obtain
vocational
training
for
people
are
public
community
colleges.
we
have
submitted
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
college
catalog
for
these
junior
colleges.
there
are
courses
such
as
air
conditioning,
inhalation
therapy.
these
children
are
being
denied
the
right
to
attend
these
courses.
the
entire
role
of
vocational
education
in
a
state
is
being
moved
into
this
area.
in
terms
of
the
question
earlier,
if
congress
had
decided
to
cut
it
off
at
age
16,
there
clearly
is
no
equal
protection
violation
involved.
if
they
had
cut
it
off
at
age
18,
there
would
not
(inaudible),
but
congress
has
not
done
that
here.
congress
has
identified
a
group
of
people
whom
it
considered
needy
and
in
need
of
federal
protection,
it
defined
them
and
call
them
dependent
children,
and
provided
financial
aid
to
them.
illinois
participates
in
the
program,
receives
huge
amounts
of
federal
money
and
still
attempts
to
exclude
some
of
those
people
that
congress
wanted
to
provide
benefits
to.
we
submit
that
this
is
wrong.
we
submit
that
this
frustrates
the
purpose
of
congress.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
they
could
exclude
the
18
to
21-year-old
group
wholly.
that
within
the
standards
established
by
the
department
of
hew,
they
must
take
everyone
within
that
group.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
is
the
only
possible
reading
of
the
act.
indeed
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
right.
our
statutory
argument
is
that
congress
has
done
it
and
our
argument
in
terms
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
is
that
in
view
of
what
congress
is
done
in
the
afdc
program.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
i
am
arguing
both
positions
here,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
as
i
read
the
equal
protection
clause
and
as
i
read
dandridge,
when
one
views
classifications
made
within
the
state,
they
must
be
rational,
but
they
must
also
be
rational
within
the
framework
of
the
program
in
which
the
classification
is
made.
this
is
particularly
true
in
this
case,
where
you
have
a
total
exclusion
of
some
children
from
a
federally
defined
class.
we
do
not
have
a
kind
of
case
as
in
dandridge
where
everyone
received
some
benefits.
and
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
point
that
out,
it
seems
to
me.
whereas
here,
we
do
have
this
total
exclusion;
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
state
has
a
justifiable
interest
in
protecting
its
fiscal
integrity
and
in
conserving
its
afdc
resources.
we
do
not
challenge
that
here.
what
we
do
challenge
is
whether
they
have
chosen
the
appropriate
vehicle
for
so
doing.
that
is
whether
they
can
do
this
by
excluding
children
from
the
class
or
whether
they
must
provide
at
least
some
benefits
to
everyone
and
simply
reduce
if
they
must,
the
level
of
benefits.
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
has
taken
--
argues
that
king
does
not
require
that
the
definition
of
dependent
children
be
read
as
a
federal
definition
requiring
the
states
to
participate
wholly.
they
argue
that
the
term
parent
in
king
was
is
some
way
essential
to
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
that
there
was
a
clear
congressional
intent
to
include
all
those
children
with
an
absent
parent
and
the
state
could
not
define
parents
in
a
way
contrary
to
the
social
security
act
which
in
its
legislative
history
meant
legally
obligated
to
support.
and
in
lewis
against
martin,
there
was
a
man
assuming
the
role
of
a
spouse
who
was
actually
living
in
the
house,
there
was
none
of
the
fiction
involved
in
king
of
a
casual
sexual
liaison
or
whatever.
here,
we
actually
have
a
man
in
the
house,
living
their
and
assumed
the
role
of
a
spouse,
but
the
court
said
that
children
where
a
man
lives
there
cannot
be
totally
excluded
from
this
program.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
requires
this
court
to
say,
that
the
definition
was
mandatory,
that
it
has
been
held
to
be
mandatory.
in
dandridge,
the
court
suggested
that
the
definition
was
fixed
by
federal
law
and
if
it
is
fixed
by
federal
law,
then
the
state
can
have
absolutely
no
right
whatsoever
to
exclude
some
of
those
needy
children
from
the
program.
the
doctrine
of
equitable
treatment
which
is
advanced
by
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
to
explain
king
creates
a
total
anomaly.
they
have
devised
a
doctrine
without
standard.
the
cases
which
they
have
taken
positions
on
cannot
be
squared
in
my
judgment.
king
was
required,
lewis
was
required
in
arizona
where
otherwise
eligible
children
living
with
relatives
not
having
legal
custody
over
the
child
and
where
the
child
had
a
sibling
living
with
his
natural
parents
were
excluded
from
the
act.
in
these
cases,
the
department
of
health
education
welfare
concedes
that
the
states
went
to
stray
and
they
have
violated
the
federal
definition
and
improperly
excluded
needy
children
from
that
definition.
but
in
the
educational
requirement
which
the
senate
report
indicates
clearly
in
my
judgment,
was
intended
to
provide
benefits
to
college
children,
to
make
sure
that
needy
children,
deprived
of
a
parent
were
not
denied
the
right
to
an
education
in
college,
at
least
where
the
state
goes
into
the
18
to
21-year-old
program.
and
it
emphasizes
that
by
saying
as
far
as
possible
that
those
children
can
be
excluded,
that
in
carter
against
stanton
which
will
be
heard
next
by
this
court,
they
interpret
continued
absence
of
being
optional
with
the
states
and
that
where
the
parents
have
deserted
or
have
been
separated
from
the
house
for
less
than
six
months,
the
state
is
free
to
exclude
needy
children.
there
is
no
standard
here
we
would
submit.
in
sum,
that
when
one
takes
a
look
at
the
purposes
of
this
act,
and
when
one
takes
a
look
at
the
classification
that
is
involved
here
whether
one
looks
at
it
in
terms
of
the
definition
of
dependent
children
under
the
supremacy
clause
or
that
when
one
looks
at
the
difference
between
vocational
training
which
is
post-secondary
and
college
training
which
is
post-secondary,
all
of
which
end
at
the
age
of
21,
neither
of
which
involved
tuition
payments.
we
can
see
no
rational
difference
whatsoever.
what
we
do
find
is
we
find
a
concerted
effort
to
keep
certain
poor
people
from
attending
free
public
and
publicly
supported
institutions.
we
find
that
an
intrusion
into
the
family
and
its
right
to
determine
the
child’s
education
which
has
an
effect
on
the
child’s
entire
future.
we
think
that
this
is
tragic
and
wrong.
we
think
does
the
solicitor
general
that
this
tends
to
perpetuate
poverty.
we
ask
for
this
case
to
be
reversed.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
nine
other
states.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
there
is
a
wide
variety
of
programs.
some
states
do
not
enter
into
the
18
to
21-year-old
category
at
all.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
some
have
gone
into
age
limit.
some
only
extend
up
to
the
age
of
it
of
19
rather
than
to
18.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
proper,
no
sir.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
right.
i
believe
that
once
they
go
into
the
18
to
21-year-old
category,
they
are
in
it.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
now
on
my
statute
argument
they
do
not
have
to
go
into
the
18
to
21-year-old
group.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
they
have
to
go
all
the
way
out.
that
is
correct.
it
is
my
position
and
to
answer
that
question
also
however,
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
have
no
doubt
that
cutting
off
19
does
satisfy.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
under
the
term
law
is
that
606
(2)
(a)
(10)
requires
all
eligible
individuals
to
be
given
aid
and
dependent
children
is
included
under
606
(a)
(2)
(b)
includes
the
18
to
21-year-old
group.
the
only
reason
why
i
say
that
they
do
not
have
to
be
included,
and
i
read
it
from
a
plain
reading
of
the
statute,
they
should
be.
when
one
looks
at
the
senate
reports
and
the
house
reports,
committee
reports,
there
is
a
clear
legislative
intent
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
right.
it
said
that
there
is
an
option.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
they
refer
to
the
18
to
21-year-old
extension
as
a
program.
they
say
that
the
program
is
optional.
they
say
that
the
provision
is
designed
to
bring
into
line
with
oasdi
and
that
the
provision,
that
is
the
educational
requirement
provision,
is
to
make
certain
that
states
who
implement
such
a
program
for
payments,
will
extend
it
to
school
or
college
and
that
children
will
not
be
prevented
from
going
to
school
or
college
because
they
are
deprived
of
parental
support.
that
is
the
reason
why
i
take
that
position
is
one
of
the
only
exceptions
in
the
act
that
i
can
find
in
which
there
is
any
kind
of
clear
legislative
intent
to
make
the
program
optional.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
begin
with
the
statutory
argument
and
i
should
like
to
address
initially.
i
should
submit
that
in
viewing
the
statutory
argument,
one
has
to
look
at
it
in
the
framework
of
the
afdc
program.
that
illinois,
in
excluding
college
children
from
the
definition
of
dependent
children,
but
including
other
forms
of
post-secondary
education,
that
is
post-secondary
vocational
education,
has
done
something
which
has
the
unfortunate
effect
of
perpetuating
poverty
which
is
clearly
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
uniformly,
no
sir.
but
it
is
both
post-secondary
and
not
post-secondary.
they
do
--
illinois
definitely
does
provide
post-secondary
vocational
training.
in
those
instances
where
children
did
not
attend
college,
however,
i
am
including
here
the
junior
colleges,
public
community
colleges,
because
both
of
the
named
appellants
here
did
attend
public
community
colleges.
these
colleges
are
the
only
free
schools
that
i
know
of
in
the
state
of
illinois.
the
vocational
institutes,
the
technical
institutes
that
are
included
in
the
appendix
to
the
appellee’s
brief,
are
all
tuition
paying
institutions
with
the
tuition
payments
of
up
to
$3,800.00.
i
should
emphasize
here,
that
we
do
not
suggest
or
intimate
that
there
is
a
requirement
to
pay
tuition.
though
in
fact,
illinois
does
under
some
circumstances.
in
this
case,
the
children
involved,
the
appellants,
the
named
appellants
were
attending
free
schools
supported
by
state
and
federal
moneys.
all
that
is
involved
here
is
their
basic
subsistence
grant.
i
say
all
that
is
involved
here,
but
obviously
that
grant
covers
their
food,
which
they
need
to
eat,
shelter
and
clothing,
the
real
essentials
of
life.
it
should
not
be
against
it.
we
differ
slightly
with
the
position
of
the
other
appellants
in
this
case
on
the
statutorily
argument.
it
is
not
our
position
that
the
definition
is
mandatory
in
every
instance.
we
recognize
that
congress
has
in
certain
instances,
indicated
very
clearly
and
unmistakably,
at
least
in
my
judgment,
that
the
program
was
intended
to
be
optional
and
the
states
were
to
have
a
choice
of
either
going
into
it
or
not
going
into
it.
an
example
of
this
is
involved
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
extension
of
the
18
to
21-year-old
group,
was
in
my
judgment
clearly
optional
that
the
senate
report
stated
under
existing
law,
states
at
their
option
may
continue
payments
to
needy
children
up
to
age
21
in
the
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
program.
then
it
goes
on,
however,
providing
they
are
regularly
attending
a
high
school
in
pursuance
of
a
course
of
study,
leading
to
a
high
school
diploma
or
its
equivalent.
the
committee
added
an
amendment
extending
this
provision,
referring
to
the
educational
requirement
provision,
so
as
to
include
needy
children
under
21
who
are
regularly
attending
a
school,
college
or
university.
in
other
words,
the
program
which
is
optional
is
the
extension
of
afdc
to
the
age
18
to
21-year-old
group,
but
the
educational
requirement
provision
is
different
and
that
was
instituted
according
to
the
report
which
was
deleted
from
the
references
by
the
solicitor
general
and
the
appellees
in
their
brief.
it
is
included
in
our
original
brief
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
9
that
the
educational
requirement
provision
and
the
extension
of
college
students
was
to
bring
the
educational
requirements
more
nearly
in
line
with
the
provision
of
the
bill
relating
to
the
continuation
of
a
child's
benefits
under
the
oasdi
system
which
is
mandatory.
then
it
goes
on;
the
objective
of
the
provision,
that
is
the
educational
requirement
provision
and
the
amendment
to
include
colleges
is
to
assure
as
far
as
possible
that
children
will
not
be
prevented
from
going
to
school
or
college
because
they
are
deprived
of
parental
support.
in
the
solicitor
general’s
brief,
the
solicitor
general
states,
that
the
department
referring
to
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare,
believes
that
the
omission
of
college
children
from
afdc
may
have
the
unfortunate
effect
of
perpetuating
poverty.
that
in
viewing
the
statute,
one
must
be
view
it,
in
terms
of
its
purposes
and
in
terms
of
its
structure
and
we
submit
that
under
both
standards,
it
requires
reading
this
provision
as
being
mandatory.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
this
is
the
old
age
survivor’s
benefits
and
social
security
act
also.
these
are
the
payments
where
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
no,
it
is
not,
but
the
reason
why
i
mentioned
and
it
is
included
in
the
committee
report
and
these
provisions
were
done
in
tandem,
that
congress
evinced
a
clear
purpose
to
make
the
provisions
as
nearly
alike
as
possible.
that
the
college
requirement’s
provision
was
added
to
afdc
because
it
was
done
in
oasdi
and
they
wanted
to
make
the
two
as
nearly
as
like
as
possible
and
that
is
the
only
reason
why
i
mention
that.
no,
it
is
not
directly
involved
in
this
case
though.
as
soon
as
the
bill
was
passed
and
completely
in
line
with
the
solicitor
general
statement
that
it
will
have
the
unfortunate
effect
of
perpetuating
poverty
and
in
line
with
the
senate
report,
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
in
its
handbook
interpreted
this
and
they
state
that
within
the
age
limit
set
by
the
state;
this
is
at
page
5
of
our
brief,
within
the
age
limit
set
by
the
state,
there
should
be
a
choice
of
attending
a
school,
college
or
university
or
taking
a
course
of
vocational
or
technical
training
for
gainful
employment.
i
think,
it
is
very,
very
important
to
recognize
here,
the
educational
structure
in
illinois
as
such
that
vocational
training
and
one
of
the
chief
weapons
used
in
order
to
obtain
vocational
training
for
people
are
public
community
colleges.
we
have
submitted
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
college
catalog
for
these
junior
colleges.
there
are
courses
such
as
air
conditioning,
inhalation
therapy.
these
children
are
being
denied
the
right
to
attend
these
courses.
the
entire
role
of
vocational
education
in
a
state
is
being
moved
into
this
area.
in
terms
of
the
question
earlier,
if
congress
had
decided
to
cut
it
off
at
age
16,
there
clearly
is
no
equal
protection
violation
involved.
if
they
had
cut
it
off
at
age
18,
there
would
not
(inaudible),
but
congress
has
not
done
that
here.
congress
has
identified
a
group
of
people
whom
it
considered
needy
and
in
need
of
federal
protection,
it
defined
them
and
call
them
dependent
children,
and
provided
financial
aid
to
them.
illinois
participates
in
the
program,
receives
huge
amounts
of
federal
money
and
still
attempts
to
exclude
some
of
those
people
that
congress
wanted
to
provide
benefits
to.
we
submit
that
this
is
wrong.
we
submit
that
this
frustrates
the
purpose
of
congress.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
they
could
exclude
the
18
to
21-year-old
group
wholly.
that
within
the
standards
established
by
the
department
of
hew,
they
must
take
everyone
within
that
group.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
is
the
only
possible
reading
of
the
act.
indeed
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
--
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
right.
our
statutory
argument
is
that
congress
has
done
it
and
our
argument
in
terms
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
is
that
in
view
of
what
congress
is
done
in
the
afdc
program.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
i
am
arguing
both
positions
here,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
as
i
read
the
equal
protection
clause
and
as
i
read
dandridge,
when
one
views
classifications
made
within
the
state,
they
must
be
rational,
but
they
must
also
be
rational
within
the
framework
of
the
program
in
which
the
classification
is
made.
this
is
particularly
true
in
this
case,
where
you
have
a
total
exclusion
of
some
children
from
a
federally
defined
class.
we
do
not
have
a
kind
of
case
as
in
dandridge
where
everyone
received
some
benefits.
and
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
point
that
out,
it
seems
to
me.
whereas
here,
we
do
have
this
total
exclusion;
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
state
has
a
justifiable
interest
in
protecting
its
fiscal
integrity
and
in
conserving
its
afdc
resources.
we
do
not
challenge
that
here.
what
we
do
challenge
is
whether
they
have
chosen
the
appropriate
vehicle
for
so
doing.
that
is
whether
they
can
do
this
by
excluding
children
from
the
class
or
whether
they
must
provide
at
least
some
benefits
to
everyone
and
simply
reduce
if
they
must,
the
level
of
benefits.
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
has
taken
--
argues
that
king
does
not
require
that
the
definition
of
dependent
children
be
read
as
a
federal
definition
requiring
the
states
to
participate
wholly.
they
argue
that
the
term
parent
in
king
was
is
some
way
essential
to
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
that
there
was
a
clear
congressional
intent
to
include
all
those
children
with
an
absent
parent
and
the
state
could
not
define
parents
in
a
way
contrary
to
the
social
security
act
which
in
its
legislative
history
meant
legally
obligated
to
support.
and
in
lewis
against
martin,
there
was
a
man
assuming
the
role
of
a
spouse
who
was
actually
living
in
the
house,
there
was
none
of
the
fiction
involved
in
king
of
a
casual
sexual
liaison
or
whatever.
here,
we
actually
have
a
man
in
the
house,
living
their
and
assumed
the
role
of
a
spouse,
but
the
court
said
that
children
where
a
man
lives
there
cannot
be
totally
excluded
from
this
program.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
requires
this
court
to
say,
that
the
definition
was
mandatory,
that
it
has
been
held
to
be
mandatory.
in
dandridge,
the
court
suggested
that
the
definition
was
fixed
by
federal
law
and
if
it
is
fixed
by
federal
law,
then
the
state
can
have
absolutely
no
right
whatsoever
to
exclude
some
of
those
needy
children
from
the
program.
the
doctrine
of
equitable
treatment
which
is
advanced
by
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
to
explain
king
creates
a
total
anomaly.
they
have
devised
a
doctrine
without
standard.
the
cases
which
they
have
taken
positions
on
cannot
be
squared
in
my
judgment.
king
was
required,
lewis
was
required
in
arizona
where
otherwise
eligible
children
living
with
relatives
not
having
legal
custody
over
the
child
and
where
the
child
had
a
sibling
living
with
his
natural
parents
were
excluded
from
the
act.
in
these
cases,
the
department
of
health
education
welfare
concedes
that
the
states
went
to
stray
and
they
have
violated
the
federal
definition
and
improperly
excluded
needy
children
from
that
definition.
but
in
the
educational
requirement
which
the
senate
report
indicates
clearly
in
my
judgment,
was
intended
to
provide
benefits
to
college
children,
to
make
sure
that
needy
children,
deprived
of
a
parent
were
not
denied
the
right
to
an
education
in
college,
at
least
where
the
state
goes
into
the
18
to
21-year-old
program.
and
it
emphasizes
that
by
saying
as
far
as
possible
that
those
children
can
be
excluded,
that
in
carter
against
stanton
which
will
be
heard
next
by
this
court,
they
interpret
continued
absence
of
being
optional
with
the
states
and
that
where
the
parents
have
deserted
or
have
been
separated
from
the
house
for
less
than
six
months,
the
state
is
free
to
exclude
needy
children.
there
is
no
standard
here
we
would
submit.
in
sum,
that
when
one
takes
a
look
at
the
purposes
of
this
act,
and
when
one
takes
a
look
at
the
classification
that
is
involved
here
whether
one
looks
at
it
in
terms
of
the
definition
of
dependent
children
under
the
supremacy
clause
or
that
when
one
looks
at
the
difference
between
vocational
training
which
is
post-secondary
and
college
training
which
is
post-secondary,
all
of
which
end
at
the
age
of
21,
neither
of
which
involved
tuition
payments.
we
can
see
no
rational
difference
whatsoever.
what
we
do
find
is
we
find
a
concerted
effort
to
keep
certain
poor
people
from
attending
free
public
and
publicly
supported
institutions.
we
find
that
an
intrusion
into
the
family
and
its
right
to
determine
the
child’s
education
which
has
an
effect
on
the
child’s
entire
future.
we
think
that
this
is
tragic
and
wrong.
we
think
does
the
solicitor
general
that
this
tends
to
perpetuate
poverty.
we
ask
for
this
case
to
be
reversed.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
nine
other
states.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
there
is
a
wide
variety
of
programs.
some
states
do
not
enter
into
the
18
to
21-year-old
category
at
all.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
some
have
gone
into
age
limit.
some
only
extend
up
to
the
age
of
it
of
19
rather
than
to
18.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
proper,
no
sir.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
right.
i
believe
that
once
they
go
into
the
18
to
21-year-old
category,
they
are
in
it.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
now
on
my
statute
argument
they
do
not
have
to
go
into
the
18
to
21-year-old
group.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
they
have
to
go
all
the
way
out.
that
is
correct.
it
is
my
position
and
to
answer
that
question
also
however,
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
have
no
doubt
that
cutting
off
19
does
satisfy.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
under
the
term
law
is
that
606
(2)
(a)
(10)
requires
all
eligible
individuals
to
be
given
aid
and
dependent
children
is
included
under
606
(a)
(2)
(b)
includes
the
18
to
21-year-old
group.
the
only
reason
why
i
say
that
they
do
not
have
to
be
included,
and
i
read
it
from
a
plain
reading
of
the
statute,
they
should
be.
when
one
looks
at
the
senate
reports
and
the
house
reports,
committee
reports,
there
is
a
clear
legislative
intent
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
right.
it
said
that
there
is
an
option.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
m.
james
spitzer,
jr.
they
refer
to
the
18
to
21-year-old
extension
as
a
program.
they
say
that
the
program
is
optional.
they
say
that
the
provision
is
designed
to
bring
into
line
with
oasdi
and
that
the
provision,
that
is
the
educational
requirement
provision,
is
to
make
certain
that
states
who
implement
such
a
program
for
payments,
will
extend
it
to
school
or
college
and
that
children
will
not
be
prevented
from
going
to
school
or
college
because
they
are
deprived
of
parental
support.
that
is
the
reason
why
i
take
that
position
is
one
of
the
only
exceptions
in
the
act
that
i
can
find
in
which
there
is
any
kind
of
clear
legislative
intent
to
make
the
program
optional.
