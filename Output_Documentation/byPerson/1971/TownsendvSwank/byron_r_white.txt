while
your
statutory
argument
was
brought
out
i
suppose
if
--
no,
it
would
be
the
same
if
illinois
did
not
give
grants
to
the
children
over
18,
who
are
attending
vocational
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it
still
be
mandatory
but
your
equal
protection
argument
would
not
obtain?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
that
both
the
federal
government
and
the
state
may
fail
to
give
grants
to
students
over
16?
justice
byron

white
entirely?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
the
federal
government
though
said
that
the
act
did
not
require
or
did
not
even
contribute
to
grants
for
children
over
16?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
there
be
any
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
in
such
a
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
will
put
it
the
other
way.
suppose
the
federal
government,
and
suppose
the
section
406
went
up
to
age
18,
but
went
no
further?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state,
went
up
to
18
and
went
no
further,
any
denial
of
equal
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though,
most
of
the
children
over
18
would
be
in
college
and
most
them
under
18
would
be
in
high
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
i
was
just
trying
to
find
out
your
equal
protection
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
sorry.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
that
if
the
state
wants
to
move
in
to
that
18
to
21
category
at
all,
it
must
support
all
those
children
in
that
age
group?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
are
going
to
any
kind
of
the
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
they
could
exclude
them
wholly?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
an
all
or
none
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
supremacy
argument
and
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
today
--
would
you
think
that
would
be
proper?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
under
your
definition?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
your
position
was
that,
your
statutory
argument
was
that
they
had
to
go
in
it
and
go
all
out
into
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
not
think
that
congress
could
or
that
the
state
could
say
give
support
payments
to
just
half
of
the
children
under
16?
you
would
not
take
just
in
terms
of
being
able
to
limit
the
state's
investment
that
will
take
every
other
child
and
give
him
support?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
congress
says
that
here
are
matching
funds
to
provide
education
for
students
over
18
in
vocational
schools
or
colleges
and
the
state
says
well
we
will
--
you
would
not
think
they
could
just
say
half
of
the
students
in
those
categories
we
will
support
and
the
other
half
we
will
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand,
i
understand
that,
but
when
they
expanded
it
up
to
the
18-21-year-old
category,
they
said
that
18-21-year-old
students
who
are
attending
vocational
school
or
college?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron

so
as
it
now
stands,
the
definitions
is
students
in
vocational

and
that
