mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
june
8th,
1970
district
judge
george
hart
dismissed
the
indictment
of
marion
and
cratch
using
his
words
for
lack
of
speedy
prosecution
in
this
case.
that
formula
of
words
can
either
be
a
paraphrase
of
the
sixth
amendment
requirement
of
a
speedy
trial;
it
could
be
an
exercise
of
the
inherent
discretionary
power
of
the
court
to
dismiss
for
want
of
prosecution;
or
it
could
conceivably
have
been
an
exercise
of
power
conferred
especially
upon
the
court
by
rule
48
(b)
conferring
power
upon
the
district
judge
to
dismiss
for
unnecessary
delay
in
presenting
the
charge
to
the
grand
jury.
with
the
exception
of
the
jurisdictional
issue,
which
i
do
not
intend
to
take
any
protected
time
with,
the
principal
issue
raised
by
this
appeal
underlies
all
of
the
various
predicates,
the
possible
predicates
for
judge
hart’s
decision,
which
is
whether
any
significance
whatsoever
is
to
be
given
to
the
elapse
of
time
between
the
commission
of
an
alleged
defense
and
the
date
on
which
the
indictment
is
filed
in
determining
whether
an
accused
should
be
required
to
stand
trial
on
criminal
charges,
assuming,
however,
that
there
is
technical
compliance
with
the
statute
of
limitations.
briefly,
it
is
the
appellees
position
that
the
filing
of
the
indictment
is
really,
merely
a
ministerial
formality
which
is
exclusively
or
virtually
exclusively
within
the
control
of
the
government,
and
the
government
should
not
be
given
unlimited
and
unsupervised
used
of
the
entire
period
of
limitations
to
assemble
its
case.
and
then
to
indict
only
when
it
is
in
effect
ready
for
immediate
trial.
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
emphasize
the
attention
being
paid
to
the
problem
of
speedy
trial
today
in
this
country
and
rules
and
statutes
are
being
formulated
in
a
number
of
jurisdictions
to
provide
that
once
the
prosecution
has
been
formally
commenced
by
the
filing
of
an
indictment,
then
specific
periods
of
time
limitations
should
be
followed,
following
the
formal
accusation
by
indictment,
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
will
be
a
frustration
of
those
rules
if
the
government
can
indulge
itself
during
the
entire
period
of
the
five
year
period
of
limitations
during
which
time
it
assembled
its
case
which
is
largely
in
secret,
largely
beyond
the
scrutiny
of
the
defendant
and
probably
will
remain
beyond
the
scrutiny
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
our
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
that
is
correct.
we
have
shown
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
well,
we
submit
your
honor
that
the
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
we
do
not
expect
that
that
will
be
the
result
in
this
case
or
it
should
be
the
result.
the
government
contends
that
it
was
understaffed.
in
the
1960’s,
the
us
attorney’s
office
did
not
have
sufficient
staff
to
prosecute
them.
so
there
is
the
scale
of
explanation
on
the
part
of
the
government.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
it
is
the
only
explanation
that
the
government
has
offered
throughout
for
its
delay
and
bringing
the
prosecution
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
but
the
government
did
not
proffer
or
offer
any
explanation
other
than
what
it
is,
what
it
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
think
he
did.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
think
his
conclusion
was
that
he
himself
took
judicial
notice
if
you
will
of
the
fact
that
there
is
an
attrition
of
human
memory
over
the
lapse
of
time
particularly
of
one
of
the
magnitude
of
which
we
are
speaking
here
and
that
he
did
not
need
any
formal
demonstration
from
the
witness
stand
of
actual
prejudice.
he
did
certainly
give
the
government
an
opportunity
to
explain
why
it
had
taken
so
long
to
do
so
and
the
only
explanation
which
was
offered
was
that
in
argument
by
the
assistant
us
attorney
who
argued
the
case
who
could
have
had
he
had
evidence
of
other
reasons
presented
that
evidence
at
that
time.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
record
can
be
read
as
providing
for
an
abrupt
interruption
by
judge
hart
of,
mr.
franco.
i
think
he
extended
him
all
the
courtesy
and
the
opportunity
to
make
his
case
that
he
needed
to
do.
i
do
not
see
that
the
government
has
been
denied
him
opportunity
and
the
government,
of
course,
knew
that
the
facts
that
we
were
representing
to
the
court
have
been
made
in
the
motions
papers
and
could
have
responded
had
it
wished
to
do
so
with
other
facts
of
its
own.
in
1965-1966
the,
mr.
marion
was
the
proprietor
of
the
business
firm
which
sold
homeowner
home
intercom
system
to
homeowners
in
the
district
and
without
going
into
the
business
practices
in
any
great
detail,
by
the
second
week
of
december
of
the
year
1966,
the
federal
trade
commission
at
that
time
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
law
and
they
proceeded
against
mr.
marion.
mr.
marion
did
not
contest
those
proceedings
and
by
the
first
week
of
february
1967,
the
federal
trade
commission
issued
a
cease-and-desist
order,
and
so
all
of
the
information
about
the
business
practices
which
the
government
has
characterized
as
a
complex
fraud
case,
all
of
this
information
was
in
the
possession
of
a
government.
nothing
what
else,
whatsoever,
nothing
else,
whatsoever
occurred
from
february
of
1967
until
october
of
1967
when
the
newspaper
articles
coupled
with
editorials
which
vehemently
demanded
prosecution
of
the
people
newspaper
articles,
though
were
the
culprits,
exposed
these
business
practices
to
public
view
and
actually
branded
them
as
fraudulent.
on
october
4th,
1967
on
the
front
page
of
this
morning
newspaper
mr.
marion
and
the
entire
washington
dc
metropolitan
area
saw
him
publicly
denounced
as
a
cheat
and
a
fraud.
dealing
with
the
--
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
showing
of
prejudice
in
this
case
and
i
indicated
to
you
sir
in
your
response
to
your
question
that
there
is
a
showing
of
actual
prejudice.
in
that,
there
is
an
attrition
or
it
can
be
assumed
that
there
is
an
attrition
of
human
memory
and
a
lapse
of
human
memory.
as
a
graphic
illustration
of
that,
at
the
same
time
that
these
articles
were
appearing
in
the
newspaper,
the
1967
world
series
was
being
played,
and
judge
hart
was
asked
to
conceive
with
the
difficulty
of
remembering
the
details
of
the
1967
world
series
which
had
occurred
in
1967,
not
1965-1966
as
the
events,
the
23
month
so
called
business
fraud
which
the
government
alleges
in
this
indictment
and
it
is
difficult
i
think
for
all
of
us
to
remember
the
details
of
events
that
far
in
offense.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
if
indeed
you
had
played
that
and
there
is
no
showing
that
mr.
marion
played
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
well,
that
remains
to
be
seen
your
honor
since
the
case
is
not
been
tried.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
it
was
--
and
that
he
was
involved,
yes,
whether
or
not
he
was
involved
in
the
so
called
criminal
activities;
it
is
another
matter.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
these
articles
however,
were
filled
with
anonymous
quotations
attributed
to
the
united
states
attorney
to
the
effect
that
a
special
fraud
squad
had
been
setup
that
the
chief
of
that
fraud
squad
had
been
relieved
of
all
other
duties
and
was
to
be
concentrating
on
these
cases,
thereafter
exclusively,
and
that
he
also
indicated
or
is
quoted
as
having
indicated
that
he
expected
indictments
within
two
weeks.
but
nothing
happened
within
the
next
two
weeks
or
the
next
two
months
and
it
was
not
until
by
marion’s
recollection
of
the
following
summer
that
anything
whatever
occurred,
the
government
remembers
that
it
was
winter,
a
year
when
it
occurred
and
that
was
an
informal
inquiry
from
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
in
charge
of
the
case
to
bring
records
and
documents
down
to
the
office.
now,
we
do
not
know
how
voluminous
these
records
were
or
at
least
it
does
not
appear
off
record
how
voluminous
they
were
but
it
can
be
inferred
from
the
record
that
they
were
of
no
greater
quality
than
to
have
required
one
trip
by
one
man
to
take
them
to
the
assistant
united
states
attorney's
office,
which
he
did,
and
he
conferred
with
mr.
glanzer
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
charge
of
this
matter,
and
he
did
so
at
some
lenght.
again,
nothing
happened.
an
entire
year
passed
and
more
and
finally,
in
march
of
1970,
mr.
marion
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
it
is
a
rule
or
ought
to
be
a
rule
of
reason.
the
question
is
when
did
the
government
objectively
have
noticed
that
a
crime
had
been
committed
by
the
one
they
intended
to
bring
to
trial
for
and
once
that
rule
of
reason
is
applied,
which
cannot
be
any
hard
and
fast
rule
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
am
sorry
your
honor;
i
did
not
understand
the
question.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor,
i
think
again
that
would
be
one
of
the
factors
to
be
considered
and
when
the
government
ought
to
proceed
for
an
indictment.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
no,
your
honor.
i
think
in
the
vast
run
of
cases
it
did
not
occur.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
our
rule
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
the
rule
that
we
believe
ought
to
be
applied
is
one
of
notice,
simple
of
notice
to
the
government,
consisting
with
all
of
the
various
factors
which
bear
upon
the
rapidity
with
which
a
case
ought
to
be
brought
to
prosecution.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
it
did
give
the
defendant
notice
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
our
position
is
that,
it
is
the
notice
to
the
government,
when
does
the
government
objectively
know
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
am
sure
that
it
could
assume
that
it
had
ceased-and-desisted,
yes
sir,
yes
your
honor
and
that
in
fact
was
the
case.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
within
a
reasonable
time
thereafter.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
again,
it
would
be
consistent
with
all
of
the
facts
of
the
case
that
the
government
have
--
was
there
a
fugitive
defendant,
for
example.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
per
se,
except
to
the
extent
that
prejudice
maybe
inferred
or
presumed
from
the
lapse
of
time
in
the
attrition
of
his
memory,
his
ability
to
respond
to
these
stale
charges.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
again,
not
in
all
mail
fraud
cases.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
think
the
burden,
ultimately,
would
devolves
upon
the
government
to
show
why
they
have
waited
after
the
defendant
had
assumed
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
government
had
objective
notice
of
the
existence
of
the
crime
and
that
it
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
in
a
case
such
as
this,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
if
the
government
does
not
sustain
its
burden
of
explaining
why
the
delay
was
as
extensive
as
it
was,
given
those
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
well,
your
honor,
perhaps,
the
most
recent
exposition
of
the
considerations
involved
is
mr.
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
in
the
dickey
versus
florida
case
in
which
all
of
these
considerations
are
explored.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
no,
your
honor
i
do
not
believe
he
said
per
se.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
he
did
not
say
that
it
was
a
per
se
rule
but
we
are
not
contending
for
a
per
se
rule,
we
are
simply
contending
for
a
rule
in
which
there
is
a
rule
of
reason
as
to
the
time
which
the
government
is
to
be
advised
to
go
forward.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
if
the
government
had
had
a
reason
for
delaying
four
years
in
this
case,
it
could
have
been
advanced
before
judge
hart
and
was
not.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
he
found
that
there
was
bound
to
have
been
an
attrition
of
the
memory
of
the
defendants
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
yes,
your
honor
i
do.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
well,
i
do
not
know
where
the
period
two-and-a-half
years
derives,
your
honor,
that
last
event
charged
in
the
indictment,
charge
occurred
in
january
of
1967.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
do
not
believe
that
this
requires
a
per
se
rule
as
to
four
year
delays.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
the
finding
as
to
the
attrition
of
the
individual’s
memory?
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
think
he
presumed
it.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
he
had
no
evidence,
that
is
correct,
no
testimony
as
to
actual
prejudice.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
our
argument
here
is
predicated
upon
the
sixth
amendment
while
there
is
conceivably
could
be
a
due
process
argument
based
upon
extreme
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
no
they
do
not
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
that
is
correct
your
honor
although
there
are
--
it
was
not
too
long
prior
to
that,
the
dickey
versus
florida
that
there
was
substantial
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
an
obligation
on
the
state
to
request
an
individual
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
if
the
facts
are
clearly
distinguishable
there
is
no
question
about
that
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
legislative
history
shows
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
do
not
suggest
that
it
was
thoughtlessly
done.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
our
position
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
none
of
those
cases,
none
of
those
rules
reached
them
and
in
fact,
our
position
is
that
they
will
be
frustrated,
vitiated
in
effect,
if
the
government
has
the
entire
five
year
hiatus
of
the
period
of
limitations
to
do
whatever
it
needs
to
do
to
prepare
its
case,
and
then
and
only
when
it
is
ready
to
go
to
trial,
it
obtains
the
indictment
and
then
announces
immediately,
we
are
ready
for
trial
against
the
defendant
who
may
have
been
during
a
four
year
period
unaware
of
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
what
evidence
would
be
offered
to
support
those
accusations
and
how
in
the
world
he
could
undertake
to
disprove
the
allegations
that
would
be
made
against
him.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
june
8th,
1970
district
judge
george
hart
dismissed
the
indictment
of
marion
and
cratch
using
his
words
for
lack
of
speedy
prosecution
in
this
case.
that
formula
of
words
can
either
be
a
paraphrase
of
the
sixth
amendment
requirement
of
a
speedy
trial;
it
could
be
an
exercise
of
the
inherent
discretionary
power
of
the
court
to
dismiss
for
want
of
prosecution;
or
it
could
conceivably
have
been
an
exercise
of
power
conferred
especially
upon
the
court
by
rule
48
(b)
conferring
power
upon
the
district
judge
to
dismiss
for
unnecessary
delay
in
presenting
the
charge
to
the
grand
jury.
with
the
exception
of
the
jurisdictional
issue,
which
i
do
not
intend
to
take
any
protected
time
with,
the
principal
issue
raised
by
this
appeal
underlies
all
of
the
various
predicates,
the
possible
predicates
for
judge
hart’s
decision,
which
is
whether
any
significance
whatsoever
is
to
be
given
to
the
elapse
of
time
between
the
commission
of
an
alleged
defense
and
the
date
on
which
the
indictment
is
filed
in
determining
whether
an
accused
should
be
required
to
stand
trial
on
criminal
charges,
assuming,
however,
that
there
is
technical
compliance
with
the
statute
of
limitations.
briefly,
it
is
the
appellees
position
that
the
filing
of
the
indictment
is
really,
merely
a
ministerial
formality
which
is
exclusively
or
virtually
exclusively
within
the
control
of
the
government,
and
the
government
should
not
be
given
unlimited
and
unsupervised
used
of
the
entire
period
of
limitations
to
assemble
its
case.
and
then
to
indict
only
when
it
is
in
effect
ready
for
immediate
trial.
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
emphasize
the
attention
being
paid
to
the
problem
of
speedy
trial
today
in
this
country
and
rules
and
statutes
are
being
formulated
in
a
number
of
jurisdictions
to
provide
that
once
the
prosecution
has
been
formally
commenced
by
the
filing
of
an
indictment,
then
specific
periods
of
time
limitations
should
be
followed,
following
the
formal
accusation
by
indictment,
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
will
be
a
frustration
of
those
rules
if
the
government
can
indulge
itself
during
the
entire
period
of
the
five
year
period
of
limitations
during
which
time
it
assembled
its
case
which
is
largely
in
secret,
largely
beyond
the
scrutiny
of
the
defendant
and
probably
will
remain
beyond
the
scrutiny
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
our
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
that
is
correct.
we
have
shown
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
well,
we
submit
your
honor
that
the
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
we
do
not
expect
that
that
will
be
the
result
in
this
case
or
it
should
be
the
result.
the
government
contends
that
it
was
understaffed.
in
the
1960’s,
the
us
attorney’s
office
did
not
have
sufficient
staff
to
prosecute
them.
so
there
is
the
scale
of
explanation
on
the
part
of
the
government.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
it
is
the
only
explanation
that
the
government
has
offered
throughout
for
its
delay
and
bringing
the
prosecution
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
but
the
government
did
not
proffer
or
offer
any
explanation
other
than
what
it
is,
what
it
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
think
he
did.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
think
his
conclusion
was
that
he
himself
took
judicial
notice
if
you
will
of
the
fact
that
there
is
an
attrition
of
human
memory
over
the
lapse
of
time
particularly
of
one
of
the
magnitude
of
which
we
are
speaking
here
and
that
he
did
not
need
any
formal
demonstration
from
the
witness
stand
of
actual
prejudice.
he
did
certainly
give
the
government
an
opportunity
to
explain
why
it
had
taken
so
long
to
do
so
and
the
only
explanation
which
was
offered
was
that
in
argument
by
the
assistant
us
attorney
who
argued
the
case
who
could
have
had
he
had
evidence
of
other
reasons
presented
that
evidence
at
that
time.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
record
can
be
read
as
providing
for
an
abrupt
interruption
by
judge
hart
of,
mr.
franco.
i
think
he
extended
him
all
the
courtesy
and
the
opportunity
to
make
his
case
that
he
needed
to
do.
i
do
not
see
that
the
government
has
been
denied
him
opportunity
and
the
government,
of
course,
knew
that
the
facts
that
we
were
representing
to
the
court
have
been
made
in
the
motions
papers
and
could
have
responded
had
it
wished
to
do
so
with
other
facts
of
its
own.
in
1965-1966
the,
mr.
marion
was
the
proprietor
of
the
business
firm
which
sold
homeowner
home
intercom
system
to
homeowners
in
the
district
and
without
going
into
the
business
practices
in
any
great
detail,
by
the
second
week
of
december
of
the
year
1966,
the
federal
trade
commission
at
that
time
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
law
and
they
proceeded
against
mr.
marion.
mr.
marion
did
not
contest
those
proceedings
and
by
the
first
week
of
february
1967,
the
federal
trade
commission
issued
a
cease-and-desist
order,
and
so
all
of
the
information
about
the
business
practices
which
the
government
has
characterized
as
a
complex
fraud
case,
all
of
this
information
was
in
the
possession
of
a
government.
nothing
what
else,
whatsoever,
nothing
else,
whatsoever
occurred
from
february
of
1967
until
october
of
1967
when
the
newspaper
articles
coupled
with
editorials
which
vehemently
demanded
prosecution
of
the
people
newspaper
articles,
though
were
the
culprits,
exposed
these
business
practices
to
public
view
and
actually
branded
them
as
fraudulent.
on
october
4th,
1967
on
the
front
page
of
this
morning
newspaper
mr.
marion
and
the
entire
washington
dc
metropolitan
area
saw
him
publicly
denounced
as
a
cheat
and
a
fraud.
dealing
with
the
--
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
showing
of
prejudice
in
this
case
and
i
indicated
to
you
sir
in
your
response
to
your
question
that
there
is
a
showing
of
actual
prejudice.
in
that,
there
is
an
attrition
or
it
can
be
assumed
that
there
is
an
attrition
of
human
memory
and
a
lapse
of
human
memory.
as
a
graphic
illustration
of
that,
at
the
same
time
that
these
articles
were
appearing
in
the
newspaper,
the
1967
world
series
was
being
played,
and
judge
hart
was
asked
to
conceive
with
the
difficulty
of
remembering
the
details
of
the
1967
world
series
which
had
occurred
in
1967,
not
1965-1966
as
the
events,
the
23
month
so
called
business
fraud
which
the
government
alleges
in
this
indictment
and
it
is
difficult
i
think
for
all
of
us
to
remember
the
details
of
events
that
far
in
offense.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
if
indeed
you
had
played
that
and
there
is
no
showing
that
mr.
marion
played
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
well,
that
remains
to
be
seen
your
honor
since
the
case
is
not
been
tried.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
it
was
--
and
that
he
was
involved,
yes,
whether
or
not
he
was
involved
in
the
so
called
criminal
activities;
it
is
another
matter.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
these
articles
however,
were
filled
with
anonymous
quotations
attributed
to
the
united
states
attorney
to
the
effect
that
a
special
fraud
squad
had
been
setup
that
the
chief
of
that
fraud
squad
had
been
relieved
of
all
other
duties
and
was
to
be
concentrating
on
these
cases,
thereafter
exclusively,
and
that
he
also
indicated
or
is
quoted
as
having
indicated
that
he
expected
indictments
within
two
weeks.
but
nothing
happened
within
the
next
two
weeks
or
the
next
two
months
and
it
was
not
until
by
marion’s
recollection
of
the
following
summer
that
anything
whatever
occurred,
the
government
remembers
that
it
was
winter,
a
year
when
it
occurred
and
that
was
an
informal
inquiry
from
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
in
charge
of
the
case
to
bring
records
and
documents
down
to
the
office.
now,
we
do
not
know
how
voluminous
these
records
were
or
at
least
it
does
not
appear
off
record
how
voluminous
they
were
but
it
can
be
inferred
from
the
record
that
they
were
of
no
greater
quality
than
to
have
required
one
trip
by
one
man
to
take
them
to
the
assistant
united
states
attorney's
office,
which
he
did,
and
he
conferred
with
mr.
glanzer
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
charge
of
this
matter,
and
he
did
so
at
some
lenght.
again,
nothing
happened.
an
entire
year
passed
and
more
and
finally,
in
march
of
1970,
mr.
marion
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
it
is
a
rule
or
ought
to
be
a
rule
of
reason.
the
question
is
when
did
the
government
objectively
have
noticed
that
a
crime
had
been
committed
by
the
one
they
intended
to
bring
to
trial
for
and
once
that
rule
of
reason
is
applied,
which
cannot
be
any
hard
and
fast
rule
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
am
sorry
your
honor;
i
did
not
understand
the
question.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor,
i
think
again
that
would
be
one
of
the
factors
to
be
considered
and
when
the
government
ought
to
proceed
for
an
indictment.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
no,
your
honor.
i
think
in
the
vast
run
of
cases
it
did
not
occur.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
our
rule
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
the
rule
that
we
believe
ought
to
be
applied
is
one
of
notice,
simple
of
notice
to
the
government,
consisting
with
all
of
the
various
factors
which
bear
upon
the
rapidity
with
which
a
case
ought
to
be
brought
to
prosecution.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
it
did
give
the
defendant
notice
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
our
position
is
that,
it
is
the
notice
to
the
government,
when
does
the
government
objectively
know
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
am
sure
that
it
could
assume
that
it
had
ceased-and-desisted,
yes
sir,
yes
your
honor
and
that
in
fact
was
the
case.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
within
a
reasonable
time
thereafter.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
again,
it
would
be
consistent
with
all
of
the
facts
of
the
case
that
the
government
have
--
was
there
a
fugitive
defendant,
for
example.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
per
se,
except
to
the
extent
that
prejudice
maybe
inferred
or
presumed
from
the
lapse
of
time
in
the
attrition
of
his
memory,
his
ability
to
respond
to
these
stale
charges.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
again,
not
in
all
mail
fraud
cases.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
think
the
burden,
ultimately,
would
devolves
upon
the
government
to
show
why
they
have
waited
after
the
defendant
had
assumed
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
government
had
objective
notice
of
the
existence
of
the
crime
and
that
it
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
in
a
case
such
as
this,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
if
the
government
does
not
sustain
its
burden
of
explaining
why
the
delay
was
as
extensive
as
it
was,
given
those
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
well,
your
honor,
perhaps,
the
most
recent
exposition
of
the
considerations
involved
is
mr.
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
in
the
dickey
versus
florida
case
in
which
all
of
these
considerations
are
explored.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
no,
your
honor
i
do
not
believe
he
said
per
se.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
he
did
not
say
that
it
was
a
per
se
rule
but
we
are
not
contending
for
a
per
se
rule,
we
are
simply
contending
for
a
rule
in
which
there
is
a
rule
of
reason
as
to
the
time
which
the
government
is
to
be
advised
to
go
forward.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
if
the
government
had
had
a
reason
for
delaying
four
years
in
this
case,
it
could
have
been
advanced
before
judge
hart
and
was
not.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
he
found
that
there
was
bound
to
have
been
an
attrition
of
the
memory
of
the
defendants
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
yes,
your
honor
i
do.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
well,
i
do
not
know
where
the
period
two-and-a-half
years
derives,
your
honor,
that
last
event
charged
in
the
indictment,
charge
occurred
in
january
of
1967.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
do
not
believe
that
this
requires
a
per
se
rule
as
to
four
year
delays.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
the
finding
as
to
the
attrition
of
the
individual’s
memory?
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
think
he
presumed
it.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
he
had
no
evidence,
that
is
correct,
no
testimony
as
to
actual
prejudice.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
our
argument
here
is
predicated
upon
the
sixth
amendment
while
there
is
conceivably
could
be
a
due
process
argument
based
upon
extreme
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
no
they
do
not
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
that
is
correct
your
honor
although
there
are
--
it
was
not
too
long
prior
to
that,
the
dickey
versus
florida
that
there
was
substantial
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
an
obligation
on
the
state
to
request
an
individual
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
if
the
facts
are
clearly
distinguishable
there
is
no
question
about
that
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
legislative
history
shows
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
i
do
not
suggest
that
it
was
thoughtlessly
done.
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
our
position
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
none
of
those
cases,
none
of
those
rules
reached
them
and
in
fact,
our
position
is
that
they
will
be
frustrated,
vitiated
in
effect,
if
the
government
has
the
entire
five
year
hiatus
of
the
period
of
limitations
to
do
whatever
it
needs
to
do
to
prepare
its
case,
and
then
and
only
when
it
is
ready
to
go
to
trial,
it
obtains
the
indictment
and
then
announces
immediately,
we
are
ready
for
trial
against
the
defendant
who
may
have
been
during
a
four
year
period
unaware
of
--
mr.
thomas
penfield
jackson
what
evidence
would
be
offered
to
support
those
accusations
and
how
in
the
world
he
could
undertake
to
disprove
the
allegations
that
would
be
made
against
him.
