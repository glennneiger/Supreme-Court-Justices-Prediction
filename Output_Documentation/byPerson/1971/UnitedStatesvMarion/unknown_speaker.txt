unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
is
the
government
going
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
if
formal
action
is
taken
before
the
statute
of
limitation
runs
out,
then
there
can
not
be
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
us
assume
it,
will
either
information
or
indictment,
in
a
five
year
statute,
is
the
government
suggesting
that
if
an
indictment
or
an
information
is
brought
down
on
the
day
before
the
statue
runs
out,
then
that
--
there
can
then
be
no
basis
for
a
claim
of
the
sixth
amendment
violation?
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
trying
to
get
here
at
is
no
formal
actions
is
taken
at
all
the
day
before
the
--
unknown
speaker
but,
conceding
that
there
maybe
a
fifth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
now
this
depending
however
on
the
showing
of
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
only
on
that
basis.
unknown
speaker
but,
this
in
any
event,
would
be
exclusively
a
due
process
basis?
unknown
speaker
and
not
a
sixth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jackson,
as
your
argument
of
rule
of
reasonomg,
is
that
predicated
under
sixth
clause
or
the
due
process
clause?
