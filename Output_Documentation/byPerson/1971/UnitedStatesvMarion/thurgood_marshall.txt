justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
greenawalt.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hate
to
interrupt
you
but
was
there
any
of
this
before
judge
hart,
any
of
this
argument?
as
i
read
it,
all
of
the
--
i
hate
to
use
the
word
defense,
but
the
only
explanation
the
government
gave
was
they
were
understaffed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
he
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
any
of
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
jackson,
did
you
say
the
day
after
the
crime
has
been
discovered
and
the
government
says
five
years
after
the
crime
has
been
discovered,
where
do
we
come
down?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
either
one
side
or
the
other?
the
government
does
explain
its
delay
and
you
do
not
show
any
interest,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we
have
just
the
fact
of
the
date,
that
is
all
we
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know,
we
will
send
in
(inaudible),
it
would
come
down
to
two-and-a-half,
would
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
we
can
not
do
that
--
we
can
not
do
that
with
constitution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
of
that
time,
should
he
be
indicted
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
your
rule
was
the
conspiracy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
a
possibility
of
eight
people
conspiring,
you
assume
there
is
one,
you
do
not
know
the
other
seven.
you
can
not
indict
that
one
right
then
and
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
you
think
that
every
indictment
now,
that
you
expect
the
court
to
find
out
whether
it
should
have
been
handed
up
in
june
instead
of
august?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
your
--
this
is
the
third
time,
i
am
still
trying
to
get
what
is
your
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
federal
trade
commission
did
not
give
notice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
gave
you
a
cease-and-desist
notice.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
did
not
the
government
assume
that
you
had
ceased-and-desisted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
did
not
have
to
indict
then,
did
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
assume
that
you
said
to
the
district
court,
to
judge
hart,
that
two-and-a-half
years
is
pro
se
too
long
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
per
se,
i
mean
per
se?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
now
if
that
rule
is
applied
then
anybody
that
is
indicted
four
years
after
the
crime
automatic
files
a
motion
and
is
dismissed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
mail
fraud
cases?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
means
burden
put
on
the
government
to
show
why
it
took
four
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
was
four-and-a-half
years
after
that,
clearly,
that
is
all
the
defendant
shows?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
the
government
does
not
remand
it
this
way?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
got
any
case
you
can
cite
on
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
say
per
se
automatically?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
that
most
stop
fraud
and
other
types
of
cases,
in
mail
fraud
cases,
they
barely
get
it
in
before
the
statute
of
limitation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
that
is
not
the
ground
that
you
did
listed,
you
just
listed
on
the
grounds
that
two-and-a-half
years
is
too
long;
that
is
what
he
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
us
to
sustain
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
means
it
makes
way
to
all
two-and-a-half
year
indictments
to
go
out
as
of
now?
justice
thurgood

well,
