mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
direct
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colombia,
dismissing
an
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
government
had
failed
to
afford
a
speedy
trial.
the
government
appealed
directly
to
this
court
pursuant
to
the
old
criminal
appeals
act
18
u.s.c.
section
3731,
under
the
provision
that
permits
an
appeal
from
a
judge
decision
or
judgment
sustaining
a
motion
and
bar
when
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy.
appellees
were
indicted
on
april
21st,
1970
on
19
counts
of
mail
fraud;
wire
fraud
and
transportation
of
falsely
made
or
altered
security.
the
indictment
charges
that
appellees
in
operating
a
home
improvement
company
called
allied
enterprises
to
fraud
the
home
owners
in
various
respects,
including
persuading
the
designed
deeds
of
trust
on
their
homes
in
promissory
notes
by
falsely
concealing
the
nature
of
these
documents
from
the
homeowners.
the
indictment
charges
of
the
fraudulent
scheme
continued
until
february
1967,
but
the
last
particular
act,
mentioned
in
the
indictment,
occurred
on
january
19,
1966.
after
the
indictment,
appellee
marion
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
for
failure
to
afford
a
speedy
trial,
which
is
set
out
on
pages
12-14
of
the
appendix,
claiming
that
the
failure
to
indict
sooner
constituted
a
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment.
on
june
8th
1970,
judge
hart
considered
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
developed
in
these
proceedings
that
in
february
1967,
the
federal
trade
commission
had
issued
cease-and-desist
order
against
allied
enterprises
and
marion.
and
then
in
the
series
of
articles
in
late
september
and
early
october
1967,
the
washington
post
had
written
about
the
activities
of
approximately
a
dozen
home
improvement
companies
which
the
articles
claimed
were
defrauding
the
public,
particularly
and
get
a
variance.
the
activities
of
allied
enterprises
were
described
in
one
of
these
series
of
articles.
the
articles
also
indicated
that
united
states
attorney
was
generally
aware
of
the
abuses
that
it
reported
and
as
he
planned
an
investigation.
the
articles
did
not
indicate
that
an
investigation
or
to
bringing
of
criminal
charges
was
planned
in
respect
to
any
specific
company
or
individuals.
either
in
the
summer
of
1968,
according
to
mr.
marion
or
early
in
1969,
according
to
the
assistant
us
attorney,
the
records
of
allied
enterprises
were
turned
over
by
marion
to
the
us
attorney’s
office.
at
the
proceedings
before
judge
hart,
mr.
jackson,
representing
marion
argued
that
given
the
public
knowledge
of
the
activities
of
allied
enterprises,
the
failure
to
return
the
indictment
until
more
than
four
years
after
the
last
noted
event
and
more
than
two-and-a-half
years
after
the
articles,
violated
marion’s
rights
to
a
speedy
trial
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
franco,
the
assistant
us
attorney
stated
that
the
government's
position
at
the
motion
should
be
dismissed
in
the
absence
of
showing
a
prejudice.
he
indicated
that
so
far
as
he
knew
the
reason
of
indictment
that
had
not
been
returned
sooner
was
under
staffing
and
a
heavy
case
load.
judge
hart
did
not
write
an
opinion,
he
indicated
in
an
oral
statement
which
is
set
out
at
page
39
of
the
appendix
that
in
the
absence
of
a
justifiable
reason
for
the
delay
from
1967
in
a
lightly
prejudiced
cause
there
was
a
lack
of
speedy
prosecution
and
he
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss.
appellees
did
not
allege
and
judge
hart
did
not
find
any
specific
prejudice
to
appellee,
such
as
the
death
of
a
key
witness
or
the
destruction
of
a
particular
document.
judge
hart
stated
that,
“the
ability
to
remember
to
build
up
in
one's
recollection,
to
produce
the
necessary
defense
is
bound
to
have
been
seriously
prejudiced
by
the
delay.”
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
in
this
kind
of
complex
fraud
prosecution,
a
defendant’s
rights
to
a
speedy
trial
or
due
process
are
violated
per
se
by
a
lapse
of
two-and-a-half
years
between
the
time
it
is
assumed
that
the
prosecutor’s
office
has
knowledge
of
complaints
that
might
conceivably
lead
to
a
criminal
prosecution,
a
lapse
of
two-and-a-half
years
between
that
time
and
the
return
of
the
indictment.
i
say
that
the
case
poses
the
questions
of
whether
the
lapse
is
per
se
a
denial
of
constitutional
rights
because
there
is
no
showing
on
this
record
that
defendant
suffered
any
particular
prejudice
or
that
the
government
acted
purposefully,
arbitrarily
or
even
negligently
in
not
bringing
the
case
before
the
grand
jury
sooner.
we
believe
that
there
is
not
nor
should
there
be
such
a
per
se
rule.
lapses
in
time
between
offense
and
formal
accusation
are,
as
this
court
said
in
united
states
versus
ewell,
governed
primarily
by
the
statute
of
limitation.
a
potential
defendant
is
further
protected
by
the
rule
that
guilt
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
a
heavy
burden
on
the
government
that
will
ordinarily
become
greater
as
the
time
between
offense
and
trial
increases.
i
shall
argue
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
apply
before
any
formal
accusatory
action
is
taken
by
the
government
that
the
due
process
clause
may
reach
certain
exceptional
circumstances
in
which
time
has
elapsed
before
a
formal
accusation,
but
the
due
process
is
not
denied
unless
there
is
substantial
and
special
prejudice
to
a
potential
defendant
and
serious
misconduct
by
the
government.
that
neither
substantial
prejudice
nor
serious
misconduct
have
been
alleged
here,
much
less
shown
and
that
therefore
the
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
the
indictment
reinstated.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
was
applicable.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
yes.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
i
think
originally
it
was
two
years
and
then
it
was
made
three
years
and
then
made
five
years.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
do
not
recall
your
honor.
i
believe
that
is
in
the
brief
but
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
i
think
some
many
types
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
is
correct.
for
homicide
and
some,
i
think
the
treason
that
in
other
words,
in
some
tax
offenses
the
statute
of
limitation
is
six
years.
there
is
a
preliminary
question
of
appealability
in
this
case.
i
believe
our
reply
brief
and
the
original
brief
indicate
clearly
why
appellee’s
motion
before
judge
hart
was
a
motion
in
bar
within
the
meaning
in
section
3731,
and
i
did
not
plan
to
discuss
that
point
further.
appellees
suggest
that
the
constitutional
questions
need
not
be
reach
here
because
judge
hart
made
a
discretionary
ruling
under
rule
48
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
again,
i
think
the
record
and
briefs
indicate
clearly
that
the
rule
was
not
and
could
not
have
been
the
source
of
this
dismissal.
and
so,
i
move
now
to
the
constitutional
issues.
in
our
view,
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
apply
until
the
government
has
taken
some
formal
accusatory
action
against
the
potential
defendant.
in
terms,
it
states
that
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
a
speedy
and
public
trial.
it
does
not
relate
to
the
speed
with
which
one
has
made
an
accused.
appellees
suggest
that
the
time
one
becomes
an
accused,
should
be
moved
back
for
speedy
trial
purposes
to
some
point
before
a
formal
action,
such
as
when
the
government
focuses
on
a
potential
defendant
or
has
sufficient
evidence
to
indict.
such
an
interpretation
is
unwarranted
by
language
or
history
or
any
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
it
would
be
most
unwise
for
reasons
like
those
which
persuaded
the
court
to
refuse
to
draw
a
similar
line
in
hoffa
versus
united
states.
there
are
many
reasons
why
a
prosecutor
may
decide
not
to
prosecute.
perhaps,
in
the
typical
instance,
it
is
known
that
a
crime
has
been
committed,
but
the
prosecutor
thinks
he
does
not
have
enough
evidence
to
achieve
a
conviction
against
a
particular
potential
defendant.
but
there
are
many
other
reasons
for
not
going
forward,
especially
in
this
kind
of
complex
prosecution
for
fraud.
not
all
frauds
are
criminal
and
the
prosecutor
may
doubt
it.
the
scheme
involves
falls
on
the
criminal
side
of
the
line,
where
that
he
can
establish
to
a
jury
their
falls
on
a
criminal
side
of
the
line,
or
he
may
doubt
even
though
he
is
quite
certain,
he
could
get
a
conviction
of
whether
the
damage
done
to
the
public
is
great
enough
to
justify
using
an
available
criminal
sanction,
or
if
there
is
a
state
offense
he
may
wait
to
see
if
a
state
prosecution
is
going
to
go
forward.
if
he
is
sure
that
some
company
representatives
have
participated
in
a
fraud,
he
maybe
unsure
which
officials
of
the
company
are
in
fact
culpable
and
which
he
can
prove
to
be
culpable
to
the
jury's
satisfaction.
putting
this
altogether,
the
prosecutor’s
decision,
whether
to
prosecute
a
particular
person
may
not
be
made
until
an
investigation
is
progressed
far
beyond
the
point
of
focus
or
sufficient
evidence
to
indict.
we
do
not
believe
that
a
court
can
reconstruct
in
retrospect
when
either
of
those
points
is
reached,
and
even
if
it
could,
it
would
not
make
sense
to
require
indictment
soon
after
either
of
those
points
have
been
reach
and
before
an
investigation
is
been
completed.
suppose
for
example,
that
in
this
kind
of
case
probable
cause
exists
on
the
basis
of
consumer
complaints
in
documentary
evidence,
that
the
united
states
attorney
judges
that
a
conviction
cannot
be
obtained
unless
there
is
an
inside
witness
who
is
willing
to
testify
to
the
fraudulent
plan
as
a
whole
and
can
also
testify
the
conversation
that
have
been
taken
place
in
the
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
let
me
make
two
points
in
response
to
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
first,
the
argument
i
am
making
now
is
not
an
argument
about
this
particular
case,
but
an
argument
as
to
whether
in
general,
the
sixth
amendment
should
be
read
to
say
that
a
speedy
trial
--
that
one
becomes
an
accused
for
speedy
trial
purposes
at
some
point
before
formal
accusatory
action
is
made
by
the
government.
and
so
what
i
am
making
now
is
a
general
argument
about
the
sixth
amendment.
in
terms
of
this
particular
case,
i
think
there
are
two
facts
that
--
in
terms
of
as
far
as
record
before
judge
hart.
one
is
that
mr.
franco
who
argued
before
judge
hart
in
these
proceedings
was
not
a
member
of
the
us
attorney’s
office
at
the
time
most
of
this
took
place
and
he
frankly
admitted
that
he
really
did
not
know
what
had
happened
in
terms
of
this
particular
investigation,
but
that
he
had
been
told
there
was
understaffing
in
a
very
heavy
case
load.
the
second
point
is
that
the
government
took
the
position,
i
think
quite
justifiably
on
the
basis
of
any
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
great
majority
of
other
federal
courts,
took
the
position
that
unless
there
was
some
specific
prejudice.
appellees
here
are
not
even
alleged
something
that
would
rise
either
to
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
or
to
the
fifth
amendment.
and
so,
he
relied
primarily
on
that
failure
to
show
any
specific
prejudice
in
arguing
before
judge
hart.
so,
i
think
that
he
did
not
think
it
was
relevant
assuming
if
there
was
not
a
purposeful
delay,
what
the
reasons
for
delay
were
and
i
think
that
is
part
of
the
explanation
why
that
is
not
more
fully
developed
in
those
proceedings.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
yes
it
would
be
a
question
of
defining
what
formal
accusatory
action
meant.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
no,
we
can
see
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
applicable
to
some
formal
accusation
before
an
indictment,
such
as
a
complaint,
an
arrest
followed
by
incarceration.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
that
is
our
contention
that
the
sixth
amendment
has
no
application.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
we
do
believe
the
due
process
clause
covers
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
our
contention
is
that
in
most
kinds
of
cases
what
must
be
shown
is
both
specific
prejudice
and
serious
government
misconduct.
now,
i
think
it
is
a
little
more
complicated
in
the
sense
that
if
the
government's
conduct
is
really
grouse,
then
perhaps
the
showing
of
prejudice
might
not
have
to
be
so
great.
if
the
showing
of
prejudice
is
tremendously
great,
it
might
even
be
conceivable
that
no
matter
how
good
the
government's
explanation,
a
prosecution
could
not
go
forward.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
am,
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
to
return
very
briefly
to
the
example
that
i
was
suggesting
which
is
that
probable
cause
exists,
that
the
the
prosecutor
does
not
think
he
can
successfully
prosecute
without
an
inside
witness.
then
let
us
suppose
two
years
later,
but
within
the
statute
of
limitation,
an
inside
witness
is
willing
to
testify.
is
prosecution
to
be
barred
simply
because
probable
cause
existed
two
years
earlier?
we
do
not
believe
there
is
any
good
reason
to
distinguish
cases
in
which
the
prosecution
has
little
or
no
evidence
from
those
as
which
there
is
probable
cause,
but
insufficient
evidence
to
convict
in
which
the
prosecutor
will
decide
not
to
go
forward.
if
indictments
are
brought
whenever
a
probable
cause
exist,
the
result
would
be
a
great
waste
of
resources
in
the
criminal
process,
and
more
important,
very
serious
misfortune
to
those
persons
who
were
indicted
but
never
tried
and
convicted,
because
the
government
indicts
because
it
realizes
that
this
is
the
probable
cause
stage
and
then
decides
it
does
not
have
enough
evidence
to
convict
and
dismisses
the
case.
well,
that
is
a
serious
misfortune
to
the
fellow
that
is
indicted.
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
a
concurring
opinion
dickey
versus
florida
suggested
a
somewhat
different
point,
that
is
the
possibility
that
one
might
become
an
accused
“after
the
government
decides
to
prosecute
and
then
have
sufficient
evidence
for
arrest
and
indictment.”
it
is
our
position
that
that
point
also
is
too
difficult
to
determine.
that
is
a
tentative
decision
to
prosecute,
and
is
typically
subject
to
change
particularly
in
this
kind
of
case
as
an
investigation
unfolds.
if
that
is
thought
to
be
the
standard
however,
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
on
this
record
that
a
decision
was
made
to
prosecute
these
appellees
until
the
case
was
--
shortly
before
the
case
was
brought
to
the
grand
jury.
and
that
is
on
this
record,
you
are
going
to
find
that
is
suggested
standard,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
sixth
amendment
is
implicated
in
this
case.
i
turn
now
to
the
due
process
clause.
it
is
our
position
referring
extraordinary
circumstances
of
the
statute
of
limitation
sets
the
time
limit
in
which
the
government
can
act
against
the
potential
defendant.
we
do
however
believe,
that
in
certain
exceptional
circumstances,
the
due
process
clause
may
bar
a
conviction.
for
example,
if
the
government
purposely
delays,
some
ill
witness
to
be
known
to
be
favorable,
the
defendant
has
a
chance
to
die
and
the
lack
of
that
witness
is
prejudicial,
we
would
believe
that
that
would
appropriately
constitute
a
denial
of
due
process,
but
absolutely
precluding
conviction
for
an
offense
is
a
drastic
remedy,
much
more
drastic
than
is
involved
in
the
implementation
of
most
other
constitutional
rights,
and
we
think
it
should
be
involved
only
in
such
exceptional
circumstances.
any
lapse
in
time
between
offense
and
trial
may
affect
a
trial
to
some
extent.
the
defendant’s
primary
protections,
as
the
court
has
indicated
and
as
i
stated
it
earlier,
are
in
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
reasonable
doubt
requirement.
it
is
not
contended
by
appellees
in
this
case
that
if
the
government
had
simply
remained
ignorant
about
its
activities
that
trial
had
might
be
afforded
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process,
nor
did
they
contend
that
they
have
suffered
any
greater
prejudice
than
would
defendants
in
a
similar
situation
where
the
government
had
remained
ignorance
for
three
years
after
the
offense
had
taken
place.
indeed,
the
possibility
of
prejudice
here
could
be
a
bit
less.
essentially,
their
claim
comes
down
to
this,
because
the
government
had
awareness
of
some
complaints
and
was
involved
in
cases
of
higher
priority,
we
were
denied
due
process
even
though
the
government
has
been
totally
ignorant
of
what
we
were
doing,
we
will
not
be
denied
due
process.
we
do
not
believe
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
turns
on
such
a
distinction
only
if
delay
is
oppressive
and
purposeful
and
causes
specific
prejudice
should
due
process
be
held
to
bar
an
indictment
within
the
statute
of
limitation.
we
further
think
that
if
the
due
process
clause
is
read
to
entail
nice
distinctions
of
time,
subtle
degrees
of
prejudice
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
prosecutor's
ordering
of
priorities
in
this
area,
the
courts
will
be
involved
in
time
consuming
collateral
proceedings
which
will
help
to
defeat
the
overall
objects
rather
than
help
it
of
an
expeditious
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
turning
out
to
the
showing
in
this
case,
appellees
have
made
no
persuasive
showing
of
prejudice.
theories
in
ewell
are
claimed
as
insubstantial,
speculative
and
premature.
they
have
not
suffered
from
the
incarceration
and
the
anxiety
in
concern
that
formal
accusation
they
bring.
the
government's
case,
it
is
said,
is
based
on
large
part
on
documents
as
to
these
elapse
in
time
is
irrelevant.
insofar
as
testimony
make
in
turn
specific
conversation
between
salesman
of
the
company
and
homeowners,
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
the
salesmen
who
have
many
transactions
each
day
would
remember
specific
conversation,
months
or
even
weeks
after
the
conversation.
what
company
officials
would
recall
would
be
their
normal
motive
business
operation.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
that
has
been
forgotten
here,
especially
since
appellees
have
had
abundant
notice
that
their
operations
were
subject
to
attack
first
to
the
f.t.c.
inquiries,
then
to
the
newspaper
articles,
then
to
a
series
of
civil
complaints,
and
finally,
from
turning
over
the
records
of
the
united
states
attorney.
it
is
incredible
to
suppose
that
they
have
not
carefully
considered
and
reconsidered
how
they
carried
on
their
business.
moreover,
they
are
free
to
call
any
of
the
homeowner
clients
they
have
had
and
do
not
think
they
have
been
defrauded.
it
is
even
possible
that
there
will
not
be
a
substantial
discrepancy
as
to
the
crucial
fact
that
this
case
goes
to
a
trial,,
since
mr.
jackson
indicated
on
pages
28-29
of
the
appendix
that
at
least
about
many
of
the
basic
operations
of
the
company,
there
was
not
a
dispute
as
to
the
fact.
if
appellees
have
suffered
prejudice,
that
can
be
demonstrated
at
their
trial
and
in
a
very
small
number
of
cases
in
which
convictions
have
been
overturned
because
of
a
lapse
in
time
before
arrest
or
indictment.
the
court
has
made
that
determination
with
the
record
of
trial
in
front
of
it,
such
as
in
the
ross
case.
secondly,
appellees
have
not
subjective,
much
less
demonstrated,
the
kind
of
government
delay,
which
should
be
held
to
be
unjustifiable.
we
have
to
suppose
on
the
basis
of
the
sparse
record
that
the
limited
staff
was
initially
focusing
on
complaints
concerning
companies
deemed
to
greater
social
danger
and
that
later
considerable
time
was
spent
in
developing
this
complex
case.
fraud
cases
of
this
kind,
and
a
number
of
the
court
of
appeals
have
recognized
this,
are
notoriously
difficult
and
time
consuming
to
develop.
a
court
simply
is
not
in
position
of
assessing
whether
an
ordering
of
priorities
is
desirable.
unless
there
is
some
special
reason
to
suppose
that
this
ordering
is
being
performed
in
an
arbitrary
way,
the
court
should
not
consider
pre
indictment
lapse
caused
by
limited
resources
to
be
a
form
of
unjustifiable
delay.
if
this
position
is
rejected
and
an
examination
is
to
be
made
of
the
ordering
of
priorities,
which
we
do
not
think
is
necessary,
then
surely
it
should
be
done
in
a
full
hearing
which
will
allow
development
in
this
case
that
the
facts
concerning
possible
prejudice
and
the
government's
ordering
of
priorities.
but
it
is
essentially
our
position
that
the
allegations
here
do
not
even
make
out
a
claim
of
constitutional
violation
and
we
thus
contend
that
the
case,
the
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
should
be
remanded,
so
that
the
indictment
maybe
reinstated.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserver
the
remaining
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.

may
it

this
case
is
on
direct
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colombia,
dismissing
an
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
government
had
failed
to
afford
a
speedy
trial.
the
government
appealed
directly
to
this
court
pursuant
to
the
old
criminal
appeals
act
18
u.s.c.
section
3731,
under
the
provision
that
permits
an
appeal
from
a
judge
decision
or
judgment
sustaining
a
motion
and
bar
when
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy.
appellees
were
indicted
on
april
21st,
1970
on
19
counts
of
mail
fraud;
wire
fraud
and
transportation
of
falsely
made
or
altered
security.
the
indictment
charges
that
appellees
in
operating
a
home
improvement
company
called
allied
enterprises
to
fraud
the
home
owners
in
various
respects,
including
persuading
the
designed
deeds
of
trust
on
their
homes
in
promissory
notes
by
falsely
concealing
the
nature
of
these
documents
from
the
homeowners.
the
indictment
charges
of
the
fraudulent
scheme
continued
until
february
1967,
but
the
last
particular
act,
mentioned
in
the
indictment,
occurred
on
january
19,
1966.
after
the
indictment,
appellee
marion
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
for
failure
to
afford
a
speedy
trial,
which
is
set
out
on
pages
12-14
of
the
appendix,
claiming
that
the
failure
to
indict
sooner
constituted
a
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment.
on
june
8th
1970,
judge
hart
considered
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
developed
in
these
proceedings
that
in
february
1967,
the
federal
trade
commission
had
issued
cease-and-desist
order
against
allied
enterprises
and
marion.
and
then
in
the
series
of
articles
in
late
september
and
early
october
1967,
the
washington
post
had
written
about
the
activities
of
approximately
a
dozen
home
improvement
companies
which
the
articles
claimed
were
defrauding
the
public,
particularly
and
get
a
variance.
the
activities
of
allied
enterprises
were
described
in
one
of
these
series
of
articles.
the
articles
also
indicated
that
united
states
attorney
was
generally
aware
of
the
abuses
that
it
reported
and
as
he
planned
an
investigation.
the
articles
did
not
indicate
that
an
investigation
or
to
bringing
of
criminal
charges
was
planned
in
respect
to
any
specific
company
or
individuals.
either
in
the
summer
of
1968,
according
to
mr.
marion
or
early
in
1969,
according
to
the
assistant
us
attorney,
the
records
of
allied
enterprises
were
turned
over
by
marion
to
the
us
attorney’s
office.
at
the
proceedings
before
judge
hart,
mr.
jackson,
representing
marion
argued
that
given
the
public
knowledge
of
the
activities
of
allied
enterprises,
the
failure
to
return
the
indictment
until
more
than
four
years
after
the
last
noted
event
and
more
than
two-and-a-half
years
after
the
articles,
violated
marion’s
rights
to
a
speedy
trial
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
franco,
the
assistant
us
attorney
stated
that
the
government's
position
at
the
motion
should
be
dismissed
in
the
absence
of
showing
a
prejudice.
he
indicated
that
so
far
as
he
knew
the
reason
of
indictment
that
had
not
been
returned
sooner
was
under
staffing
and
a
heavy
case
load.
judge
hart
did
not
write
an
opinion,
he
indicated
in
an
oral
statement
which
is
set
out
at
page
39
of
the
appendix
that
in
the
absence
of
a
justifiable
reason
for
the
delay
from
1967
in
a
lightly
prejudiced
cause
there
was
a
lack
of
speedy
prosecution
and
he
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss.
appellees
did
not
allege
and
judge
hart
did
not
find
any
specific
prejudice
to
appellee,
such
as
the
death
of
a
key
witness
or
the
destruction
of
a
particular
document.
judge
hart
stated
that,
“the
ability
to
remember
to
build
up
in
one's
recollection,
to
produce
the
necessary
defense
is
bound
to
have
been
seriously
prejudiced
by
the
delay.”
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
in
this
kind
of
complex
fraud
prosecution,
a
defendant’s
rights
to
a
speedy
trial
or
due
process
are
violated
per
se
by
a
lapse
of
two-and-a-half
years
between
the
time
it
is
assumed
that
the
prosecutor’s
office
has
knowledge
of
complaints
that
might
conceivably
lead
to
a
criminal
prosecution,
a
lapse
of
two-and-a-half
years
between
that
time
and
the
return
of
the
indictment.
i
say
that
the
case
poses
the
questions
of
whether
the
lapse
is
per
se
a
denial
of
constitutional
rights
because
there
is
no
showing
on
this
record
that
defendant
suffered
any
particular
prejudice
or
that
the
government
acted
purposefully,
arbitrarily
or
even
negligently
in
not
bringing
the
case
before
the
grand
jury
sooner.
we
believe
that
there
is
not
nor
should
there
be
such
a
per
se
rule.
lapses
in
time
between
offense
and
formal
accusation
are,
as
this
court
said
in
united
states
versus
ewell,
governed
primarily
by
the
statute
of
limitation.
a
potential
defendant
is
further
protected
by
the
rule
that
guilt
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
a
heavy
burden
on
the
government
that
will
ordinarily
become
greater
as
the
time
between
offense
and
trial
increases.
i
shall
argue
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
apply
before
any
formal
accusatory
action
is
taken
by
the
government
that
the
due
process
clause
may
reach
certain
exceptional
circumstances
in
which
time
has
elapsed
before
a
formal
accusation,
but
the
due
process
is
not
denied
unless
there
is
substantial
and
special
prejudice
to
a
potential
defendant
and
serious
misconduct
by
the
government.
that
neither
substantial
prejudice
nor
serious
misconduct
have
been
alleged
here,
much
less
shown
and
that
therefore
the
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
the
indictment
reinstated.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
was
applicable.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
yes.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
i
think
originally
it
was
two
years
and
then
it
was
made
three
years
and
then
made
five
years.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
do
not
recall
your
honor.
i
believe
that
is
in
the
brief
but
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
i
think
some
many
types
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
is
correct.
for
homicide
and
some,
i
think
the
treason
that
in
other
words,
in
some
tax
offenses
the
statute
of
limitation
is
six
years.
there
is
a
preliminary
question
of
appealability
in
this
case.
i
believe
our
reply
brief
and
the
original
brief
indicate
clearly
why
appellee’s
motion
before
judge
hart
was
a
motion
in
bar
within
the
meaning
in
section
3731,
and
i
did
not
plan
to
discuss
that
point
further.
appellees
suggest
that
the
constitutional
questions
need
not
be
reach
here
because
judge
hart
made
a
discretionary
ruling
under
rule
48
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
again,
i
think
the
record
and
briefs
indicate
clearly
that
the
rule
was
not
and
could
not
have
been
the
source
of
this
dismissal.
and
so,
i
move
now
to
the
constitutional
issues.
in
our
view,
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
apply
until
the
government
has
taken
some
formal
accusatory
action
against
the
potential
defendant.
in
terms,
it
states
that
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
a
speedy
and
public
trial.
it
does
not
relate
to
the
speed
with
which
one
has
made
an
accused.
appellees
suggest
that
the
time
one
becomes
an
accused,
should
be
moved
back
for
speedy
trial
purposes
to
some
point
before
a
formal
action,
such
as
when
the
government
focuses
on
a
potential
defendant
or
has
sufficient
evidence
to
indict.
such
an
interpretation
is
unwarranted
by
language
or
history
or
any
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
it
would
be
most
unwise
for
reasons
like
those
which
persuaded
the
court
to
refuse
to
draw
a
similar
line
in
hoffa
versus
united
states.
there
are
many
reasons
why
a
prosecutor
may
decide
not
to
prosecute.
perhaps,
in
the
typical
instance,
it
is
known
that
a
crime
has
been
committed,
but
the
prosecutor
thinks
he
does
not
have
enough
evidence
to
achieve
a
conviction
against
a
particular
potential
defendant.
but
there
are
many
other
reasons
for
not
going
forward,
especially
in
this
kind
of
complex
prosecution
for
fraud.
not
all
frauds
are
criminal
and
the
prosecutor
may
doubt
it.
the
scheme
involves
falls
on
the
criminal
side
of
the
line,
where
that
he
can
establish
to
a
jury
their
falls
on
a
criminal
side
of
the
line,
or
he
may
doubt
even
though
he
is
quite
certain,
he
could
get
a
conviction
of
whether
the
damage
done
to
the
public
is
great
enough
to
justify
using
an
available
criminal
sanction,
or
if
there
is
a
state
offense
he
may
wait
to
see
if
a
state
prosecution
is
going
to
go
forward.
if
he
is
sure
that
some
company
representatives
have
participated
in
a
fraud,
he
maybe
unsure
which
officials
of
the
company
are
in
fact
culpable
and
which
he
can
prove
to
be
culpable
to
the
jury's
satisfaction.
putting
this
altogether,
the
prosecutor’s
decision,
whether
to
prosecute
a
particular
person
may
not
be
made
until
an
investigation
is
progressed
far
beyond
the
point
of
focus
or
sufficient
evidence
to
indict.
we
do
not
believe
that
a
court
can
reconstruct
in
retrospect
when
either
of
those
points
is
reached,
and
even
if
it
could,
it
would
not
make
sense
to
require
indictment
soon
after
either
of
those
points
have
been
reach
and
before
an
investigation
is
been
completed.
suppose
for
example,
that
in
this
kind
of
case
probable
cause
exists
on
the
basis
of
consumer
complaints
in
documentary
evidence,
that
the
united
states
attorney
judges
that
a
conviction
cannot
be
obtained
unless
there
is
an
inside
witness
who
is
willing
to
testify
to
the
fraudulent
plan
as
a
whole
and
can
also
testify
the
conversation
that
have
been
taken
place
in
the
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
let
me
make
two
points
in
response
to
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
first,
the
argument
i
am
making
now
is
not
an
argument
about
this
particular
case,
but
an
argument
as
to
whether
in
general,
the
sixth
amendment
should
be
read
to
say
that
a
speedy
trial
--
that
one
becomes
an
accused
for
speedy
trial
purposes
at
some
point
before
formal
accusatory
action
is
made
by
the
government.
and
so
what
i
am
making
now
is
a
general
argument
about
the
sixth
amendment.
in
terms
of
this
particular
case,
i
think
there
are
two
facts
that
--
in
terms
of
as
far
as
record
before
judge
hart.
one
is
that
mr.
franco
who
argued
before
judge
hart
in
these
proceedings
was
not
a
member
of
the
us
attorney’s
office
at
the
time
most
of
this
took
place
and
he
frankly
admitted
that
he
really
did
not
know
what
had
happened
in
terms
of
this
particular
investigation,
but
that
he
had
been
told
there
was
understaffing
in
a
very
heavy
case
load.
the
second
point
is
that
the
government
took
the
position,
i
think
quite
justifiably
on
the
basis
of
any
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
great
majority
of
other
federal
courts,
took
the
position
that
unless
there
was
some
specific
prejudice.
appellees
here
are
not
even
alleged
something
that
would
rise
either
to
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
or
to
the
fifth
amendment.
and
so,
he
relied
primarily
on
that
failure
to
show
any
specific
prejudice
in
arguing
before
judge
hart.
so,
i
think
that
he
did
not
think
it
was
relevant
assuming
if
there
was
not
a
purposeful
delay,
what
the
reasons
for
delay
were
and
i
think
that
is
part
of
the
explanation
why
that
is
not
more
fully
developed
in
those
proceedings.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
yes
it
would
be
a
question
of
defining
what
formal
accusatory
action
meant.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
no,
we
can
see
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
applicable
to
some
formal
accusation
before
an
indictment,
such
as
a
complaint,
an
arrest
followed
by
incarceration.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
that
is
our
contention
that
the
sixth
amendment
has
no
application.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
we
do
believe
the
due
process
clause
covers
--
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
our
contention
is
that
in
most
kinds
of
cases
what
must
be
shown
is
both
specific
prejudice
and
serious
government
misconduct.
now,
i
think
it
is
a
little
more
complicated
in
the
sense
that
if
the
government's
conduct
is
really
grouse,
then
perhaps
the
showing
of
prejudice
might
not
have
to
be
so
great.
if
the
showing
of
prejudice
is
tremendously
great,
it
might
even
be
conceivable
that
no
matter
how
good
the
government's
explanation,
a
prosecution
could
not
go
forward.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
i
am,
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
to
return
very
briefly
to
the
example
that
i
was
suggesting
which
is
that
probable
cause
exists,
that
the
the
prosecutor
does
not
think
he
can
successfully
prosecute
without
an
inside
witness.
then
let
us
suppose
two
years
later,
but
within
the
statute
of
limitation,
an
inside
witness
is
willing
to
testify.
is
prosecution
to
be
barred
simply
because
probable
cause
existed
two
years
earlier?
we
do
not
believe
there
is
any
good
reason
to
distinguish
cases
in
which
the
prosecution
has
little
or
no
evidence
from
those
as
which
there
is
probable
cause,
but
insufficient
evidence
to
convict
in
which
the
prosecutor
will
decide
not
to
go
forward.
if
indictments
are
brought
whenever
a
probable
cause
exist,
the
result
would
be
a
great
waste
of
resources
in
the
criminal
process,
and
more
important,
very
serious
misfortune
to
those
persons
who
were
indicted
but
never
tried
and
convicted,
because
the
government
indicts
because
it
realizes
that
this
is
the
probable
cause
stage
and
then
decides
it
does
not
have
enough
evidence
to
convict
and
dismisses
the
case.
well,
that
is
a
serious
misfortune
to
the
fellow
that
is
indicted.
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
a
concurring
opinion
dickey
versus
florida
suggested
a
somewhat
different
point,
that
is
the
possibility
that
one
might
become
an
accused
“after
the
government
decides
to
prosecute
and
then
have
sufficient
evidence
for
arrest
and
indictment.”
it
is
our
position
that
that
point
also
is
too
difficult
to
determine.
that
is
a
tentative
decision
to
prosecute,
and
is
typically
subject
to
change
particularly
in
this
kind
of
case
as
an
investigation
unfolds.
if
that
is
thought
to
be
the
standard
however,
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
on
this
record
that
a
decision
was
made
to
prosecute
these
appellees
until
the
case
was
--
shortly
before
the
case
was
brought
to
the
grand
jury.
and
that
is
on
this
record,
you
are
going
to
find
that
is
suggested
standard,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
sixth
amendment
is
implicated
in
this
case.
i
turn
now
to
the
due
process
clause.
it
is
our
position
referring
extraordinary
circumstances
of
the
statute
of
limitation
sets
the
time
limit
in
which
the
government
can
act
against
the
potential
defendant.
we
do
however
believe,
that
in
certain
exceptional
circumstances,
the
due
process
clause
may
bar
a
conviction.
for
example,
if
the
government
purposely
delays,
some
ill
witness
to
be
known
to
be
favorable,
the
defendant
has
a
chance
to
die
and
the
lack
of
that
witness
is
prejudicial,
we
would
believe
that
that
would
appropriately
constitute
a
denial
of
due
process,
but
absolutely
precluding
conviction
for
an
offense
is
a
drastic
remedy,
much
more
drastic
than
is
involved
in
the
implementation
of
most
other
constitutional
rights,
and
we
think
it
should
be
involved
only
in
such
exceptional
circumstances.
any
lapse
in
time
between
offense
and
trial
may
affect
a
trial
to
some
extent.
the
defendant’s
primary
protections,
as
the
court
has
indicated
and
as
i
stated
it
earlier,
are
in
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
reasonable
doubt
requirement.
it
is
not
contended
by
appellees
in
this
case
that
if
the
government
had
simply
remained
ignorant
about
its
activities
that
trial
had
might
be
afforded
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process,
nor
did
they
contend
that
they
have
suffered
any
greater
prejudice
than
would
defendants
in
a
similar
situation
where
the
government
had
remained
ignorance
for
three
years
after
the
offense
had
taken
place.
indeed,
the
possibility
of
prejudice
here
could
be
a
bit
less.
essentially,
their
claim
comes
down
to
this,
because
the
government
had
awareness
of
some
complaints
and
was
involved
in
cases
of
higher
priority,
we
were
denied
due
process
even
though
the
government
has
been
totally
ignorant
of
what
we
were
doing,
we
will
not
be
denied
due
process.
we
do
not
believe
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
turns
on
such
a
distinction
only
if
delay
is
oppressive
and
purposeful
and
causes
specific
prejudice
should
due
process
be
held
to
bar
an
indictment
within
the
statute
of
limitation.
we
further
think
that
if
the
due
process
clause
is
read
to
entail
nice
distinctions
of
time,
subtle
degrees
of
prejudice
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
prosecutor's
ordering
of
priorities
in
this
area,
the
courts
will
be
involved
in
time
consuming
collateral
proceedings
which
will
help
to
defeat
the
overall
objects
rather
than
help
it
of
an
expeditious
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
turning
out
to
the
showing
in
this
case,
appellees
have
made
no
persuasive
showing
of
prejudice.
theories
in
ewell
are
claimed
as
insubstantial,
speculative
and
premature.
they
have
not
suffered
from
the
incarceration
and
the
anxiety
in
concern
that
formal
accusation
they
bring.
the
government's
case,
it
is
said,
is
based
on
large
part
on
documents
as
to
these
elapse
in
time
is
irrelevant.
insofar
as
testimony
make
in
turn
specific
conversation
between
salesman
of
the
company
and
homeowners,
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
the
salesmen
who
have
many
transactions
each
day
would
remember
specific
conversation,
months
or
even
weeks
after
the
conversation.
what
company
officials
would
recall
would
be
their
normal
motive
business
operation.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
that
has
been
forgotten
here,
especially
since
appellees
have
had
abundant
notice
that
their
operations
were
subject
to
attack
first
to
the
f.t.c.
inquiries,
then
to
the
newspaper
articles,
then
to
a
series
of
civil
complaints,
and
finally,
from
turning
over
the
records
of
the
united
states
attorney.
it
is
incredible
to
suppose
that
they
have
not
carefully
considered
and
reconsidered
how
they
carried
on
their
business.
moreover,
they
are
free
to
call
any
of
the
homeowner
clients
they
have
had
and
do
not
think
they
have
been
defrauded.
it
is
even
possible
that
there
will
not
be
a
substantial
discrepancy
as
to
the
crucial
fact
that
this
case
goes
to
a
trial,,
since
mr.
jackson
indicated
on
pages
28-29
of
the
appendix
that
at
least
about
many
of
the
basic
operations
of
the
company,
there
was
not
a
dispute
as
to
the
fact.
if
appellees
have
suffered
prejudice,
that
can
be
demonstrated
at
their
trial
and
in
a
very
small
number
of
cases
in
which
convictions
have
been
overturned
because
of
a
lapse
in
time
before
arrest
or
indictment.
the
court
has
made
that
determination
with
the
record
of
trial
in
front
of
it,
such
as
in
the
ross
case.
secondly,
appellees
have
not
subjective,
much
less
demonstrated,
the
kind
of
government
delay,
which
should
be
held
to
be
unjustifiable.
we
have
to
suppose
on
the
basis
of
the
sparse
record
that
the
limited
staff
was
initially
focusing
on
complaints
concerning
companies
deemed
to
greater
social
danger
and
that
later
considerable
time
was
spent
in
developing
this
complex
case.
fraud
cases
of
this
kind,
and
a
number
of
the
court
of
appeals
have
recognized
this,
are
notoriously
difficult
and
time
consuming
to
develop.
a
court
simply
is
not
in
position
of
assessing
whether
an
ordering
of
priorities
is
desirable.
unless
there
is
some
special
reason
to
suppose
that
this
ordering
is
being
performed
in
an
arbitrary
way,
the
court
should
not
consider
pre
indictment
lapse
caused
by
limited
resources
to
be
a
form
of
unjustifiable
delay.
if
this
position
is
rejected
and
an
examination
is
to
be
made
of
the
ordering
of
priorities,
which
we
do
not
think
is
necessary,
then
surely
it
should
be
done
in
a
full
hearing
which
will
allow
development
in
this
case
that
the
facts
concerning
possible
prejudice
and
the
government's
ordering
of
priorities.
but
it
is
essentially
our
position
that
the
allegations
here
do
not
even
make
out
a
claim
of
constitutional
violation
and
we
thus
contend
that
the
case,
the
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
should
be
remanded,
so
that
the
indictment
maybe
reinstated.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserver
the
remaining
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
r.
kent
greenawalt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
