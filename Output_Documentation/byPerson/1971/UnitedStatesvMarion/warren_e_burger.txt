chief

e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
19,
united
states
against
marion
and
cratch.
mr.
greenawalt,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
you
have
about
six
minutes
i
think.
mr.
jackson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
are
not
compliant
to
that
explanation
if
we
--
for
the
matters
we
can
judicially
notice,
are
we?
that
is
argument;
that
was
not
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
will
have
no
trial,
so
there
was
no
occasion
to
give
them
anything
here
except
the
legal
arguments.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
read
this
record
to
the
judge’s
action
of
indicting
anybody
to
go
into
the
facts,
you
cut
off
by
saying
the
prejudice
is
bound
to
have
occurred.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
probably
an
invitation
to
pursue
the
inquiry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
what
evidence
did
judge
hart
break
make
that
finding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
were
discussing
dickey
against
florida
a
little
bit
earlier.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
reasons
for
the
delay
by
the
state
of
florida
in
that
case
was
that
the
man
was,
dickey
was
in
a
federal
prison
and
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
court's
opinion,
they
could
have
reached
him
anytime
and
brought
him
down
for
the
trial,
but
they
just
deliberately
waited
until
he
was
released
and
to
be
released
from
the
federal
penitentiary.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
i
am
suggesting
is
dickey
against
florida,
in
its
facts,
does
not
have
much
to
do
with
this
case,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
have
to
assume
from
that
this
extension
from
three
years
to
five
years
was
thoughtlessly
done
without
any
concern
for
the
realities.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
of
these
rules
that
you
are
suggesting
such
as
the
second
circuit
rule
and
recent
actions
in
other
areas
have
had
to
do
with
bringing
cases
on
for
trial
after
indictment
have
been
off?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
none
of
those
things
reached
the
problem
we
are
dealing
with
here.
chief
justice
warren

burger
