justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
prettyman
what
--
didn't
they
examine
him
in
baltimore?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
doctor
goodmarker
is
still
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
agree
with
mr.
prettyman
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
why
the
judge
insisted
on
the
psychiatric
examination?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lord,
i
am
sorry,
i
can't
agree
with
you
that
the
doctor
did
that
without
any
consideration
of
the
requirements
of
patuxent,
unless
i
am
wrong.
am
i
correct
that
he
was
told
to
find
out
whether
or
not
this
main
was
subject
to
go
to
patuxent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
wasn't
for
his
right
to
stand
trial,
he
had
already
been
convicted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
then
there
is
some
connection
with
patuxent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
knew
what
the
requirements
were?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
be
expected
to
assume
what
might
happen,
if
they
did
not
ask
him
how
many
crimes
he
committed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
asked
the
other,
i
mean,
the
psychiatrist
has
asked
him
other
questions
rather
than
what
crimes
he
committed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
might
agree.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
not
interested
in
getting
him
in
patuxent,
we
are
interested
in
getting
him
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
are
talking
about
is
you
need
to
get
him
in,
but
suppose
the
psychiatrist
says,
look,
i
want
to
help
you
and
i
am
not
interested
at
all
in
another
crimes
you
committed,
we
want
to
look
to
the
future,
he
might
have
cooperated?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
has
never
had
that
opportunity.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
as
of
now,
as
long
as
he
refuses
to
answer
incriminating
questions,
he
is
there
through
end
of
his
life.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mentioned
earlier
that
the
judge
could
have
given
him
20
years
for
what
now
been
given
as
life.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
state's
terms
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
to
what
he
says.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
fifth
amendment
right
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
law
says
when
he
got
convicted
or
did
he
lose
it
when
he
went
to
patuxent,
when
did
he
lose
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
said
he
did
not
have
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lord,
how
can
you
bind
a
county
prosecutor
in
maryland?
you
work
with
attorney
general's
staff?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can't
stop
at
the
county
attorney
from
using
that
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
could
not
stop
them
from
using
it,
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
bet
you
could
do
it,
i
am
just
worried
about
you
binding
them
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want

to
tell
this

justice
thurgood

well,
he
never
suggests
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
that
he
has
to
answer
these
questions.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
want
us
to
tell
him
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
any
of
those
horrors
come
to
fit
this
case
which
only
asked
that
this
man
be
given
a
one
