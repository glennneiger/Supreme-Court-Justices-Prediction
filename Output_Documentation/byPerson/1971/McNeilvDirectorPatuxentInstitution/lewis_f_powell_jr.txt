mr.
prettyman,
i
think
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
thought
the
system
at
patuxent
was
essentially
a
good
one.
assume
for
the
moment
that
mr.
mcneil
had
cooperated
and
had
gone
right
down
the
line
with
the
system,
including
the
final
judicial
hearing
and
had
been
adjudged
to
be
a
defective
delinquent,
bringing
into
operation
the
indeterminate
sentence.
would
you
be
here
today,
if
you
had
that
case?

your
position
if
i
understand
it
is
that
a
sure
way
to
avoid
the
system
at
patuxent
is
not
to
cooperate
with
it,
if
your
term
is
one
year
or
three
years
or
five
years,
when
that
expires
you
