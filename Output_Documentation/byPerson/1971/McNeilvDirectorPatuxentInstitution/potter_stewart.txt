justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
his
court
hearing,
mr.
prettyman.
justice
potter
stewart
after
he
goes
back
to
the
jury
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
your
position
now
was
now
that
the
time
of
the
sentence
has
elapsed
that
he
is
entitled
to
his
release.
justice
potter
stewart
not
that
he
has
--
not
to
go
back
to
the
court
at
this
date.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
shows
he
is
delinquent
and
then
only
other
question
is
whether
or
not
he
is
defective?
justice
potter
stewart
you
might
be
a
very
effective
delinquent?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
right,
(a)
that
he
is
a
delinquent
and
(b)
that
he
is
defective.
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute,
it's
not
that
you
can't
find
either,
but
you
have
to
find
both.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
they
show
his
delinquency
through
his
own
answers,
after
he
decided
or
not,
he
is
intellectually
defective,
has
intellectual
deficiency
or
emotional
imbalance.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
sit
down,
even
though
you
won
couldn't
it
be
sort
of
a
period
that
couldn't
he
be
then
civilly
committed?
justice
potter
stewart
let
us
then
say
that
we
decided
that
he
is
now
entitled
to
his
release
then
the
very
next
day
couldn't
he
be
civilly
committed.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
defective
delinquency.
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
was
not
psychotic.
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
think
that
is
an
issue
--
that
is
not
an
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
that
was
contested
here
in
this
litigation.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
have
got
that
rule
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
you
made
that
commitment
to
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
this
person
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
person
would
have
been
subject
to
any
recidivist
statute
there
for
his
first
offense.

stewart
just
