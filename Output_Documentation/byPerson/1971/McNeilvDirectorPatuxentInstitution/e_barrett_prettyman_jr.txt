mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
barrett
prettyman
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
edward
mcneil
in
this
case
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
maryland
court
of
special
appeal.
mr.
mcneil
is
an
inmate
at
patuxent
institution.
he
is
been
there
almost
six
years.
his
minimum
sentence
for
the
crime
of
which
he
was
convicted
expired
over
four
years
ago.
his
maximum
sentence
for
this
crime
expired
almost
a
year
ago
and
yet
he
is
never
had
a
hearing
on
his
incarceration
at
patuxent.
he
is
never
been
declared
a
defective
delinquent.
mr.
mcneil
was
19
when
he
was
convicted
in
baltimore
with
an
assault
on
a
police
officer
and
of
an
assault
with
intent
to
rape.
at
his
trial
there
was
no
plea
and
no
evidence
of
insanity.
the
issue
was
never
raised
anywhere.
he
had
no
prior
conviction
and
the
time
of
his
offense
he
was
a
graduate
of
a
high
school,
he
was
employed,
he
was
living
with
his
parents
and
contributing
to
their
means.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
after
his
conviction,
the
court
said
as
follows.
“while
the
court
records
do
not
reflect
a
conviction
on
any
previous
charge,
i
feel
from
what
i
know
about
this
young
man
that
a
psychiatric
report
is
indicated.
the
matter
will
be
held
sub
curia
and
referred
to
the
medical
department,
that
would
be
the
medical
department
of
the
baltimore
bench,
for
a
psychiatric
evaluation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
do
not
know.
i
would
guess
that
the
probation
report
was
not
available
at
that
time,
but
rather
was
available
at
the
subsequent
sentencing
which
occurred
later,
but
there
is
no
way
of
knowing.
there
was
an
off
the
record
conference
at
the
bench
after
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
and
before
the
judge
made
that
announcement
we
had
no
idea
what
occurred
then
what
information
he
received.
he
did
say
however
that
he
--
that
there
was
no
prior
conviction.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
mean
after
he
reached
patuxent?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
then
if
he
had
cooperated,
they
could
have
discovered
whether
he
was
a
defective
delinquent.
i
think
that
they
could
have
discovered
either
way
that
he
was
or
was
not.
i
think
they
could
have
discovered
that
six
years
ago
without
talking
to
him;
probably,
possibly,
we
do
not
know.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
i
was
about
to
say.
six
days
later
there
was
a
report
submitted,
a
medical
report
it
is
a
rather
strange
self
contradictory
report.
it
found
no
evidence
of
psychosis,
distortion,
hallucinations,
delusions,
but
it
said
that
he
seemed
to
have
a
limited
tolerance
for
stress,
that
seemed
to
be
based
on
the
fact
that
the
plat
name
vehemently
denied
ever
having
committed
any
crimes
or
antisocial
--
conducted
any
antisocial
conduct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
--
unfortunately
sir,
the
report
itself
is
a
not
in
the
record.
it
was
a
dr.
sheen,
but
it
was
from
the
baltimore
branch
office,
dr.
sheen
who
conducted
the
actual.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
he
said
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
personality
pattern
disturbance,
schizoid
type
and
he
recommended
evaluation
at
patuxent
as
a
result.
there
was
never
a
hearing,
i
want
emphasize
this,
this
was
never
a
hearing
on
that
report
or
on
the
referral
itself.
instead
at
the
sentencing
10
days
later
mr.
mcneil
was
sentenced
to
five
years
imprisonment
on
one
count,
one
year
imprisonment
on
the
other,
the
two
to
run
concurrently
and
then
he
was
referred
to
patuxent
for
evaluation
and
if
necessary
for
treatment.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir,
by
the
sentencing
judge.
it
was
all
done
in
the
same
paragraph.
there
was
no
mention
of
this
report.
there
were
no
witnesses,
no
examination,
no
finding.
the
doctor
did
not
appear
in
court,
so
far
as
we
can
tell.
the
record
doesn't
even
reflect
whether
the
report
was
shown
to
mcneil
or
not
or
his
attorney,
we
do
not
know
that.
the
court
simply
signed
a
formal
order
reciting
that
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
mr.
mcneil
maybe
a
defective
delinquent
and
he
was
sent
to
patuxent.
now,
at
patuxent
as
you
know
from
the
murel
argument
a
week
or
so
ago,
when
you
arrive
you
are
placed
on
a
receiving
tier
and
as
the
court
also
knows,
this
is
a
very
vital
and
important
part
of
the
structure
at
patuxent.
it
is
a
way
--
the
tier
system
is
way
of
advancing
out
of
patuxent.
you
go
to
from
one
tier
to
the
next,
depending
upon
the
extent
that
which
you
cooperate,
and
you
progress
and
you
show
that
you
are
no
longer
threat
to
society
and
so
forth,
then
after
you
get
beyond
the
forth
tier
you
move
out.
difficulty
is
that
that
there
is
no
way
of
getting
out
of
the
receiving
tier
and
tell
there
is
a
report
on
you
and
in
this
case
they
have
never
issued
a
report
on
him.
the
people
on
the
receiving
tier
cannot
advance,
they
cannot
receive
therapy.
in
effect
they
are
in
limbo
with
little,
but
limited
exercise
and
television
while
they
are
there.
mr.
mcneil
has
been
on
the
receiving
tier
for
almost
six
years.
during
this
period
on
at
least
15
different
occasions,
the
state
says
18,
but
i
think
it
is
irrelevant,
he
has
refused
to
submit
to
interrogation
by
by
staff.
patuxent
apparently
thinks
that
this
is
essential
to
its
evaluation.
he
has
refused
to
submit
on
fifth
ground
and
so
he
has
remained
there.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
the
mckenzie
case,
cited
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
the
same
position
was
taken
in
regard
to
mr.
mckenzie.
he
will
not
talk
and
therefore
we
cannot
make
a
report.
the
court
said
oh,
his
been
there
beyond
his
sentence
you
make
a
report.
they
made
a
report
and
said
he
was
a
defective
delinquent.
the
report
was
made
without
any
communication
with
mr.
mckenzie.
now
his
hearing
is
still
pending,
at
least
the
last
i
heard.
there
is
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
hearing
which
--
yes,
the
court
hearing
which
would
be
proceed
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
my
answer
is
two-fold
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
first
place
this
is
not
a
completely
normal
psychiatric
examination
in
the
sense
of
someone
being
committed
to
an
insane
asylum
because
the
standards
are
different
under
this
particular
statute,
but
secondly
the
testimony
in
the
murel
case
is
clear
that
while
it's
extremely
difficult
to
find
out
whether
someone
is
a
defective
delinquent
without
talking
to
him
and
while
in
many
cases
you
may
not
be
able
to
do
it,
the
testimony
is
also
clear
that
it
can
be
done
in
some
circumstances,
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
some
cases,
i
do
not
for
a
moment
claim
that
it
can
necessarily
be
done
with
him,
i
do
not
know.
it
maybe
that
they
cannot
make
a
finding
that
he
is
a
defective
delinquent.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
without
his
cooperation,
that
is
correct.
now,
our
arguments,
although
we
list
at
least
five
different
constitutional
provisions
come
down
really
to
two
points.
first,
no
matter
what
his
reasons
for
refusing
to
cooperate,
no
matter
how
quixotic
they
maybe.
no
matter
if
there
is
no
reason
at
all.
the
state
cannot
keep
him
confined
indefinitely
without
a
hearing,
and
particularly
pass
the
end
of
his
criminal
sentence.
i
do
not
care
what
his
reasons
are.
if
he
doesn't
like
the
color
of
the
hair
of
a
psychiatrist,
he
is
entitled
to
go
back
to
the
court
and
have
that
issue
determined
as
to
whether
they
are
entitled
to
keep
him
there.
he
has
never
had
a
hearing.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
question
about
it,
but
we
claim
that
he
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
quite
right.
i
am
asking
this
court
to
release
him
now
that
the
sentence
is
over,
but
i
am
really
addressing
myself
to
the
basic
question
of
what
happens
when
somebody
gets
there
even
during
the
first
six
months
and
he
refuses
to
cooperate.
can
you
keep
him
indefinitely
there
which
is
what
the
state
claims
to
be
able
to
do
without
any
hearing
or
must
they
go
back
to
the
court
to
get
some
kind
of
determination
of
what
his
and
their
rights
are.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
if
they
cannot
find
that
he
is
a
defective
delinquent
then
he
goes
back
to
prison
under
the
normal
course
and
he
serves
out
his
sentence
then
he
is
free.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
would
think
the
system
set
up
by
the
statute
is
a
good
one
which
was
not
followed
here,
namely
they
keep
him
for
six
months
and
then
they
are
supposed
to
report
back
to
the
court.
now
at
the
end
of
six
months
they
had
six
months
to
observe
him
to
gather
all
of
this
information
that
they
say
they
get,
all
of
his
past
records,
they
are
supposed
to
talk
to
his
friends
and
families
and
so
forth.
they
are
supposed
to
have
this
mass
of
evidence
in
his
file,
then
they
go
back
to
the
court
at
the
end
of
six
months
and
report.
it
maybe
that
they
can
say
without
talking
to
him
we
can
find
he
is
or
he
is
not
a
defective
delinquent
based
upon
six
months
of
observation
and
his
record.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
then
the
court--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
about
that
for
this
reason,
that
it
is
not
patuxent
after
all
that
makes
the
determination.
it
is
the
court
that
makes
the
determination
on
the
basis
of
the
record
and
the
recommendation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
then
he
goes
back
to
prison.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
he
ought
to
be
serving
out
his
sentence
in
patuxent
if
they
cannot
make
a
determination
that
he
is
in
fact
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
a
defective
delinquent
any
more
than
you
could
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh!
absolutely.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
he
were
at
--
were
he
had
been
sentenced,
he
would
have
receiving
therapy
for
six
years.
it
this
one
of
the
irony
of
these
situations
that
he
cannot
get
therapy
in
patuxent
where
they
are
supposed
to
give
it
and
they
keep
--
he
could
have
gotten
it
if
he
had
been
sent
to
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
he
might
well
talk
if
he
did
not
have
to
answer
the
kinds
of
questions
that
are
going
to
be
directed
to
him
by
patuxent.
he
might
well
feel
that
he
would
participate
in
a
group
therapy
or
even
a
personal
therapy
if
it
is
was
not
the
kind
of
things
designed
here.
now,
let
us
focus
on
that
for
moment.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
think
so.
if
your
honor
will
look,
look
at
our
brief
on
--
if
your
honor
will
look
at
page
36
of
our
brief
and
look
at
footnote
43.
now,
this
is
extracted
from
the
report
of
the
report
of
the
medical
office
and
shows
the
interrogation
that
they
made
preliminarily,
merely
to
find
whether
he
should
go
to
patuxent.
and
let
us
look
at
some
of
the
questions
that
they
were
asking
and
to
see
why
he
was
not
answering
questions.
he
adamantly
and
vehemently
denies,
despite
the
police
reports
that
he
was
involved
in
the
offense.
further
questioning
revealed
that
he
had
stolen
some
shoes,
but
he
insisted
that
he
did
not
know
that
they
were
stolen.
in
the
tenth
grade
he
got
caught,
he
was
taking
some
milk
and
cookies.
down
a
little
further
he
adamant
in
insisting
on
this
version
of
the
offense
despite
the
police
report
which
was
in
the
brief
and
which
i
have
available
and
discussed
with
him
and
so
forth.
now
why
were
these
questions
asked
and
why
would
similar
questions
be
asked
at
patuxent.
the
reason
is
that
in
order
for
him
to
be
declared
a
defective
delinquent,
they
have
to
find
that
he
has
engaged
in
persistent
criminal
and
antisocial
conduct.
now,
in
this
case
we
only
have
one
conviction,
but
apparently
that
had
some
things
in
his
record
that
they
wanted
to
question
him
about
if
they
can
get
from
his
own
lips
that
yes,
he
stole
a
milk
in
school
and
yes,
he
stole
some
shoes
and
yes
he
did
some
other
things,
they
can
make
a
finding
based
on
his
own
admissions
that
he
engaged
in
persistent
criminal
conduct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
it
goes
to
the
entire
definition.
in
order
to
be
a
defective
delinquent
you
have
to
find
that
he
was
engaged
in
this.
if
you
were
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
[attempted
laughter]that
is
very
well
put,
your
honor.
if
your
honor
will
look
at
page
6
in
footnote
6,
you
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
footnote
6
on
page
6.
the
defective
delinquent
is
defined
as
an
individual
who
by
the
demonstration
of
persistent,
aggravated
antisocial
or
criminal
behavior
evidences
a
propensity
toward
criminal
activity.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
but
then
the
rest
of
it
is
not
“or”
it
is
“and,”
you
have
to
make
both
find
to
say.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
if
it
suits
your
honor,
you
divide
it
up
that
is
fine,
but
i
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right
and
once
you
find
both
then
he
is
a
defective
delinquent
and
then
he
gets
an
indeterminate
sentence
at
patuxent.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right,
and
that's
the
reason
that
they
are
going
to
answer
these
questions
and
your
honor
said
he
wouldn't
engage
in
therapy,
we
do
not
know
that
all
because
therapy
after
all
would
not
be
trying
to
prove
that
he
had
been
engaged
in
persistent
criminal
behavior,
every
time
you
get
to
the
essence
of
the
man
to
try
help
him
so
that
he
could
when
he
got
out
of
prison
he
will
be
a
better
man.
and
is
it
one
of
the
ironies
as
i
say
of
the
situation,
he'd
have
had
six
--
five
years
of
therapy
and
he'd
simply
going
to
jail.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
therapy
at
hagerstown
would
begin
regardless
that
is
what
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
do
not
know
the
procedure
that
is
engaged
in
prison,
but
my
understanding
is
that
anybody
in
prison
who
either
wants
therapy
or
who
the
prison
authorities
would
be
helped
by
therapy
is
allowed
to
have
therapy.
i
do
not
think
they
have
to
make
a
separate
determination
that
he
is
in
fact
either
defective
delinquent
or
that
he
is
psychotic
or
anything
else,
it
is
available
at
prison.
here,
however,
in
order
for
him
to
get
therapy,
he
is
first
got
to
be
found
to
be
a
defective
delinquent
and
get
all
of
that
receiving
tier
into
the
first
tier.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
depend
a
lot
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
individual
file.
i
think
for
example,
let
us
say
for
example,
the
institution
comes
back
and
it
says
we
haven't
been
able
to
talk
to
him,
but
on
the
other
hand
we
been
able
to
gain
some
valuable
information
by
watching
him.
on
the
other
because
of
scarcity
of
personnel
we
have
been
only
been
able
to
watch
for
a
limited
number
of
months.
if
we
could
have
two
more
months
to
watch
in
i
think
we
will
able
to
come
in
with
a
recommendation.
it
might
will
be
that
would
not
be
so
unreasonable
as
to
be
a
constitutional
violation.
i
do
not
think
you
can
lay
down
on
a
flat
rule
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
because
if
so
long
as
they
report
back
within
six
months
i
think
if
the
court
were
to
make
a
finding
that
they
were
entitled
to
look
at
him
again,
it
could
well
be
extended.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
if
the
judge
were
to
find
that
he
was
refusing
to
cooperate
on
purely
arbitrary
grounds
with
no
grounds
at
all
and
he
were
so
to
inform
the
man,
so
that
the
man
would
have
a
judicial
finding
that
the
grounds
that
he
was
asserting
for
refusing
to
cooperate
were
invalid
and
it
might
will
be
that
in
effect
they
would
be
giving
him
a
second
chance
to
cooperate
and
he
might
or
might
not.
but
in
this
case
where
the
man
is
refusing
to
cooperate
because
of
the
questions
that
they
were
trying
to
ask
him
would
be
violating
the
peace
amendment
to
do
this.
then
i
very
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
is
not
going
to
order
him
back
to
answer
because
the
reason
is
the
same
and
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
conceivably
get
around
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
would
be
taking
the
position
here
even
if
his
criminal
sentence
had
not
expired
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
judicial
hearing
when
they
refused
to
do
anything
with
him
except
to
say
that
he
can
be
kept
indefinitely,
but
i
think
this.
that
once
his
sentence
has
been
served
whatever
excuse
there
may
have
been
up
until
that
period
for
keeping
him
whether
they
want
to
look
at
him
some
more
or
whether
they
want
to
give
him
more
chances
to
talk
or
whatever,
totally
disappeared
because
at
that
point
he
has
served
his
debt
to
society,
the
period
for
them
to
report
for
holding
a
hearing
is
long
since
gone.
let
me
show
you
why
they
do
not
have
a
hearing,
mr.
justice.
they
do
not
have
a
hearing
because
there
is
nothing
they
can
get
out
of
it.
if
they
hold
a
hearing
and
he
said
that
not
to
be
a
defective
delinquent,
he
goes
free.
if
they
hold
a
hearing
and
he
is
to
determined
to
be
a
defective
delinquent,
what
does
he
get,
he
gets
precisely
the
sentence
his
got
right
now
which
is
an
indefinite
confinement.
they
claim
they
can
keep
him
for
life
because
he
refuses
to
answer
these
incriminating
questions
so
why
hold
a
hearing.
from
their
standpoint,
they
have
got
him
forever.
the
only
way
he
can
get
out
of
the
receiving
tier
and
get
a
report
is
by
saying
yes,
i
stolen
the
cookies
in
high
school
and
i
might
say
parenthetically
it
is
rather
odd,
but
in
maryland
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
at
all
on
any
crime
for
which
you
can
be
sentenced
to
prison.
they
can
go
back
when
the
man
is
80-years
old
and
convict
him
for
something
he
did
when
he
was
25.
so
it
is
a
very
real
and
serious
problem
for
this
man
where
they
are
saying,
didn't
you
really
steel
these
shoes
and
look
at
what
the
fbi
report
says.
we
know
you
were
not
convicted
of
this,
but
tell
us
weren't
you
really
and
then
they
go
in,
they
actually
go
into
the
defective
delinquency
hearing
and
testify
about
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
for
any
crime
for
which
you
can
be
sentenced
to
prison.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
would
be
a
petitioner
in
murel,
probably
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
would
be
adapting
probably
many
of
the
objections
of
the
system
that
mr.
murel
and
the
other
petitioners
had,
but
this
i
want
to
emphasize
is
a
very,
very
different
case.
it
was
more
like
avey,
only
mr.
avey
died
and
therefore
that
issue
wasn't
before
you
there,
but
it
is
more
akin
to
that
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
not
necessarily
because
as
in
the
mckenzie
case
that
may
find
you
to
be
a
defective
delinquent
anyway,
if
they
have
a
proper
record
and
can
uphold
that.
i
must
say
in
this
case
they
say
in
their
brief
that
they
do
not
have
enough
evidence
to
hold
him,
to
find
him
to
be
a
defective
delinquent,
but
let
me
point
out
to
you.
what
do
they
say
they
have
got?
they
do
not
even
show
that
they
have
talked
to
his
family
and
friends
and
schoolmates
as
all
of
the
evidence
in
murel
they
gave
--
they
say
when
it
sound
like
about
this
extraordinary
investigation
that
they
conduct
in
order
to
get
his
full
folder
on
somebody,
they
had
six
years
to
get
that
kind
of
a
folder
on
this
man
and
they
do
not
even
show
in
his
file
that
they
done
what
they
have
been
so
proud
off
elsewhere
and
they
say
they
cannot
find
him
to
be
a
defective
delinquent
on
this
record.
and
i
say
alright
you
had
your
chance
for
six
years,
now
he
is
entitled
to
release.
i
did
have
a
more
points,
but
your
honor
i
would
like
to
say
sometime
for
rebuttal.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh!
if
he
could
be
civilly
committed,
possible
if
he
is
qualified.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
under
the
civil
commitments
you
have
different
standards
than
you
do
here.
i
think
the
man
is
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
it
certainly
isn't.
he
would
have
to
be
a
psychotic
and
one
of
the
interesting
things
is
that
the
referral
report
here
specifically
said
they
did
not
think
he
was
delinquent.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
so,
i
do
not
think
they
could.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
please
the
court,
in
view
of
the
concessions
made
by
the
state
let
me
just
make
one
last
point
in
regard
to
the
remedy.
the
reason
i
indicated
that
i
think
the
man
ought
to
be
ordered
immediately
released
as
opposed
to
just
having
a
hearing
at
this
point
is
this.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
state
has
said
in
their
brief
that
they
cannot
find
him
to
be
a
defective
delinquent
based
on
this
record,
in
view
with
the
fact
that
i
as
his
attorney
i
am
not
about
to
telling
him
that
he
should
incriminate
himself
based
on
the
state's
assurance
to
this
court
that
they
do
not
plan
to
convict
him
on
the
basis
of
what
he
is
going
to
say,
a
hearing
would
be
a
wasted
gesture.
he
has
now
serve
his
full
criminal
term.
i
can
read
you
from
cases
where
things
that
these
fellows
have
said
in
the
course
these
interviews
have
then
been
used
in
court
to
keep
them
in
patuxent
indefinitely
and
moreover
we
have
no
idea
how
in
view
with
fact
that
what
he
says
goes
right
into
his
file
which
is
open
to
the
prosecutor,
the
information
that
he
gives
could
not
be
used
as
a
link
to
chain
to
prosecute
him
later.
they
are
all
kinds
of
holes
in
this
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
say
three
things
one.
while
his
original
sentence
was
still
open
they
could
use
it
to
re-convict
him
that
is
no
longer
true
here,
but
that
is
in
other
cases.
number
two,
they
could
convict
him
now
and
at
any
time
for
anything
that
he
confessed
to
in
the
course
of
this
interrogation
in
which
they
would
get
evidence
out
of
this
file
and
number
three,
without
any
question
they
would
use
it
to
keep
him
in
patuxent
indefinitely
because
just
to
read
you
in
the
daniel’s
case
a
very
brief.
this
is
man
convicted
of
house
breaking
and
larceny
and
when
they
tried
to
keep
him
in
they
give
evidence
of
sexual
behavior
of
the
inmate
used
and
the
court
said
that
was
alright,
they
could
used
that
as
evidence
to
keep
him
indefinitely
with
patuxent
without
any
relationship
to
his
original
crime.
of
course
they
are
going
to
use
it
in
that
is
file
would
never
tell
this
man
to
talk
and
why
therefore
i
think
a
hearing
of
this
stage
is
a
wasted
gesture,
why
his
entitled
to
immediate
release.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
barrett
prettyman
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
edward
mcneil
in
this
case
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
maryland
court
of
special
appeal.
mr.
mcneil
is
an
inmate
at
patuxent
institution.
he
is
been
there
almost
six
years.
his
minimum
sentence
for
the
crime
of
which
he
was
convicted
expired
over
four
years
ago.
his
maximum
sentence
for
this
crime
expired
almost
a
year
ago
and
yet
he
is
never
had
a
hearing
on
his
incarceration
at
patuxent.
he
is
never
been
declared
a
defective
delinquent.
mr.
mcneil
was
19
when
he
was
convicted
in
baltimore
with
an
assault
on
a
police
officer
and
of
an
assault
with
intent
to
rape.
at
his
trial
there
was
no
plea
and
no
evidence
of
insanity.
the
issue
was
never
raised
anywhere.
he
had
no
prior
conviction
and
the
time
of
his
offense
he
was
a
graduate
of
a
high
school,
he
was
employed,
he
was
living
with
his
parents
and
contributing
to
their
means.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
after
his
conviction,
the
court
said
as
follows.
“while
the
court
records
do
not
reflect
a
conviction
on
any
previous
charge,
i
feel
from
what
i
know
about
this
young
man
that
a
psychiatric
report
is
indicated.
the
matter
will
be
held
sub
curia
and
referred
to
the
medical
department,
that
would
be
the
medical
department
of
the
baltimore
bench,
for
a
psychiatric
evaluation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
do
not
know.
i
would
guess
that
the
probation
report
was
not
available
at
that
time,
but
rather
was
available
at
the
subsequent
sentencing
which
occurred
later,
but
there
is
no
way
of
knowing.
there
was
an
off
the
record
conference
at
the
bench
after
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
and
before
the
judge
made
that
announcement
we
had
no
idea
what
occurred
then
what
information
he
received.
he
did
say
however
that
he
--
that
there
was
no
prior
conviction.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
mean
after
he
reached
patuxent?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
then
if
he
had
cooperated,
they
could
have
discovered
whether
he
was
a
defective
delinquent.
i
think
that
they
could
have
discovered
either
way
that
he
was
or
was
not.
i
think
they
could
have
discovered
that
six
years
ago
without
talking
to
him;
probably,
possibly,
we
do
not
know.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
i
was
about
to
say.
six
days
later
there
was
a
report
submitted,
a
medical
report
it
is
a
rather
strange
self
contradictory
report.
it
found
no
evidence
of
psychosis,
distortion,
hallucinations,
delusions,
but
it
said
that
he
seemed
to
have
a
limited
tolerance
for
stress,
that
seemed
to
be
based
on
the
fact
that
the
plat
name
vehemently
denied
ever
having
committed
any
crimes
or
antisocial
--
conducted
any
antisocial
conduct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
--
unfortunately
sir,
the
report
itself
is
a
not
in
the
record.
it
was
a
dr.
sheen,
but
it
was
from
the
baltimore
branch
office,
dr.
sheen
who
conducted
the
actual.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
he
said
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
personality
pattern
disturbance,
schizoid
type
and
he
recommended
evaluation
at
patuxent
as
a
result.
there
was
never
a
hearing,
i
want
emphasize
this,
this
was
never
a
hearing
on
that
report
or
on
the
referral
itself.
instead
at
the
sentencing
10
days
later
mr.
mcneil
was
sentenced
to
five
years
imprisonment
on
one
count,
one
year
imprisonment
on
the
other,
the
two
to
run
concurrently
and
then
he
was
referred
to
patuxent
for
evaluation
and
if
necessary
for
treatment.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir,
by
the
sentencing
judge.
it
was
all
done
in
the
same
paragraph.
there
was
no
mention
of
this
report.
there
were
no
witnesses,
no
examination,
no
finding.
the
doctor
did
not
appear
in
court,
so
far
as
we
can
tell.
the
record
doesn't
even
reflect
whether
the
report
was
shown
to
mcneil
or
not
or
his
attorney,
we
do
not
know
that.
the
court
simply
signed
a
formal
order
reciting
that
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
mr.
mcneil
maybe
a
defective
delinquent
and
he
was
sent
to
patuxent.
now,
at
patuxent
as
you
know
from
the
murel
argument
a
week
or
so
ago,
when
you
arrive
you
are
placed
on
a
receiving
tier
and
as
the
court
also
knows,
this
is
a
very
vital
and
important
part
of
the
structure
at
patuxent.
it
is
a
way
--
the
tier
system
is
way
of
advancing
out
of
patuxent.
you
go
to
from
one
tier
to
the
next,
depending
upon
the
extent
that
which
you
cooperate,
and
you
progress
and
you
show
that
you
are
no
longer
threat
to
society
and
so
forth,
then
after
you
get
beyond
the
forth
tier
you
move
out.
difficulty
is
that
that
there
is
no
way
of
getting
out
of
the
receiving
tier
and
tell
there
is
a
report
on
you
and
in
this
case
they
have
never
issued
a
report
on
him.
the
people
on
the
receiving
tier
cannot
advance,
they
cannot
receive
therapy.
in
effect
they
are
in
limbo
with
little,
but
limited
exercise
and
television
while
they
are
there.
mr.
mcneil
has
been
on
the
receiving
tier
for
almost
six
years.
during
this
period
on
at
least
15
different
occasions,
the
state
says
18,
but
i
think
it
is
irrelevant,
he
has
refused
to
submit
to
interrogation
by
by
staff.
patuxent
apparently
thinks
that
this
is
essential
to
its
evaluation.
he
has
refused
to
submit
on
fifth
ground
and
so
he
has
remained
there.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
the
mckenzie
case,
cited
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
the
same
position
was
taken
in
regard
to
mr.
mckenzie.
he
will
not
talk
and
therefore
we
cannot
make
a
report.
the
court
said
oh,
his
been
there
beyond
his
sentence
you
make
a
report.
they
made
a
report
and
said
he
was
a
defective
delinquent.
the
report
was
made
without
any
communication
with
mr.
mckenzie.
now
his
hearing
is
still
pending,
at
least
the
last
i
heard.
there
is
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
hearing
which
--
yes,
the
court
hearing
which
would
be
proceed
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
my
answer
is
two-fold
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
first
place
this
is
not
a
completely
normal
psychiatric
examination
in
the
sense
of
someone
being
committed
to
an
insane
asylum
because
the
standards
are
different
under
this
particular
statute,
but
secondly
the
testimony
in
the
murel
case
is
clear
that
while
it's
extremely
difficult
to
find
out
whether
someone
is
a
defective
delinquent
without
talking
to
him
and
while
in
many
cases
you
may
not
be
able
to
do
it,
the
testimony
is
also
clear
that
it
can
be
done
in
some
circumstances,
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
some
cases,
i
do
not
for
a
moment
claim
that
it
can
necessarily
be
done
with
him,
i
do
not
know.
it
maybe
that
they
cannot
make
a
finding
that
he
is
a
defective
delinquent.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
without
his
cooperation,
that
is
correct.
now,
our
arguments,
although
we
list
at
least
five
different
constitutional
provisions
come
down
really
to
two
points.
first,
no
matter
what
his
reasons
for
refusing
to
cooperate,
no
matter
how
quixotic
they
maybe.
no
matter
if
there
is
no
reason
at
all.
the
state
cannot
keep
him
confined
indefinitely
without
a
hearing,
and
particularly
pass
the
end
of
his
criminal
sentence.
i
do
not
care
what
his
reasons
are.
if
he
doesn't
like
the
color
of
the
hair
of
a
psychiatrist,
he
is
entitled
to
go
back
to
the
court
and
have
that
issue
determined
as
to
whether
they
are
entitled
to
keep
him
there.
he
has
never
had
a
hearing.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
question
about
it,
but
we
claim
that
he
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
quite
right.
i
am
asking
this
court
to
release
him
now
that
the
sentence
is
over,
but
i
am
really
addressing
myself
to
the
basic
question
of
what
happens
when
somebody
gets
there
even
during
the
first
six
months
and
he
refuses
to
cooperate.
can
you
keep
him
indefinitely
there
which
is
what
the
state
claims
to
be
able
to
do
without
any
hearing
or
must
they
go
back
to
the
court
to
get
some
kind
of
determination
of
what
his
and
their
rights
are.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
if
they
cannot
find
that
he
is
a
defective
delinquent
then
he
goes
back
to
prison
under
the
normal
course
and
he
serves
out
his
sentence
then
he
is
free.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
would
think
the
system
set
up
by
the
statute
is
a
good
one
which
was
not
followed
here,
namely
they
keep
him
for
six
months
and
then
they
are
supposed
to
report
back
to
the
court.
now
at
the
end
of
six
months
they
had
six
months
to
observe
him
to
gather
all
of
this
information
that
they
say
they
get,
all
of
his
past
records,
they
are
supposed
to
talk
to
his
friends
and
families
and
so
forth.
they
are
supposed
to
have
this
mass
of
evidence
in
his
file,
then
they
go
back
to
the
court
at
the
end
of
six
months
and
report.
it
maybe
that
they
can
say
without
talking
to
him
we
can
find
he
is
or
he
is
not
a
defective
delinquent
based
upon
six
months
of
observation
and
his
record.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
then
the
court--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
about
that
for
this
reason,
that
it
is
not
patuxent
after
all
that
makes
the
determination.
it
is
the
court
that
makes
the
determination
on
the
basis
of
the
record
and
the
recommendation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
then
he
goes
back
to
prison.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
he
ought
to
be
serving
out
his
sentence
in
patuxent
if
they
cannot
make
a
determination
that
he
is
in
fact
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
a
defective
delinquent
any
more
than
you
could
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh!
absolutely.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
he
were
at
--
were
he
had
been
sentenced,
he
would
have
receiving
therapy
for
six
years.
it
this
one
of
the
irony
of
these
situations
that
he
cannot
get
therapy
in
patuxent
where
they
are
supposed
to
give
it
and
they
keep
--
he
could
have
gotten
it
if
he
had
been
sent
to
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
he
might
well
talk
if
he
did
not
have
to
answer
the
kinds
of
questions
that
are
going
to
be
directed
to
him
by
patuxent.
he
might
well
feel
that
he
would
participate
in
a
group
therapy
or
even
a
personal
therapy
if
it
is
was
not
the
kind
of
things
designed
here.
now,
let
us
focus
on
that
for
moment.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
think
so.
if
your
honor
will
look,
look
at
our
brief
on
--
if
your
honor
will
look
at
page
36
of
our
brief
and
look
at
footnote
43.
now,
this
is
extracted
from
the
report
of
the
report
of
the
medical
office
and
shows
the
interrogation
that
they
made
preliminarily,
merely
to
find
whether
he
should
go
to
patuxent.
and
let
us
look
at
some
of
the
questions
that
they
were
asking
and
to
see
why
he
was
not
answering
questions.
he
adamantly
and
vehemently
denies,
despite
the
police
reports
that
he
was
involved
in
the
offense.
further
questioning
revealed
that
he
had
stolen
some
shoes,
but
he
insisted
that
he
did
not
know
that
they
were
stolen.
in
the
tenth
grade
he
got
caught,
he
was
taking
some
milk
and
cookies.
down
a
little
further
he
adamant
in
insisting
on
this
version
of
the
offense
despite
the
police
report
which
was
in
the
brief
and
which
i
have
available
and
discussed
with
him
and
so
forth.
now
why
were
these
questions
asked
and
why
would
similar
questions
be
asked
at
patuxent.
the
reason
is
that
in
order
for
him
to
be
declared
a
defective
delinquent,
they
have
to
find
that
he
has
engaged
in
persistent
criminal
and
antisocial
conduct.
now,
in
this
case
we
only
have
one
conviction,
but
apparently
that
had
some
things
in
his
record
that
they
wanted
to
question
him
about
if
they
can
get
from
his
own
lips
that
yes,
he
stole
a
milk
in
school
and
yes,
he
stole
some
shoes
and
yes
he
did
some
other
things,
they
can
make
a
finding
based
on
his
own
admissions
that
he
engaged
in
persistent
criminal
conduct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
it
goes
to
the
entire
definition.
in
order
to
be
a
defective
delinquent
you
have
to
find
that
he
was
engaged
in
this.
if
you
were
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
[attempted
laughter]that
is
very
well
put,
your
honor.
if
your
honor
will
look
at
page
6
in
footnote
6,
you
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
footnote
6
on
page
6.
the
defective
delinquent
is
defined
as
an
individual
who
by
the
demonstration
of
persistent,
aggravated
antisocial
or
criminal
behavior
evidences
a
propensity
toward
criminal
activity.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
but
then
the
rest
of
it
is
not
“or”
it
is
“and,”
you
have
to
make
both
find
to
say.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
if
it
suits
your
honor,
you
divide
it
up
that
is
fine,
but
i
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right
and
once
you
find
both
then
he
is
a
defective
delinquent
and
then
he
gets
an
indeterminate
sentence
at
patuxent.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right,
and
that's
the
reason
that
they
are
going
to
answer
these
questions
and
your
honor
said
he
wouldn't
engage
in
therapy,
we
do
not
know
that
all
because
therapy
after
all
would
not
be
trying
to
prove
that
he
had
been
engaged
in
persistent
criminal
behavior,
every
time
you
get
to
the
essence
of
the
man
to
try
help
him
so
that
he
could
when
he
got
out
of
prison
he
will
be
a
better
man.
and
is
it
one
of
the
ironies
as
i
say
of
the
situation,
he'd
have
had
six
--
five
years
of
therapy
and
he'd
simply
going
to
jail.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
therapy
at
hagerstown
would
begin
regardless
that
is
what
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
do
not
know
the
procedure
that
is
engaged
in
prison,
but
my
understanding
is
that
anybody
in
prison
who
either
wants
therapy
or
who
the
prison
authorities
would
be
helped
by
therapy
is
allowed
to
have
therapy.
i
do
not
think
they
have
to
make
a
separate
determination
that
he
is
in
fact
either
defective
delinquent
or
that
he
is
psychotic
or
anything
else,
it
is
available
at
prison.
here,
however,
in
order
for
him
to
get
therapy,
he
is
first
got
to
be
found
to
be
a
defective
delinquent
and
get
all
of
that
receiving
tier
into
the
first
tier.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
depend
a
lot
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
individual
file.
i
think
for
example,
let
us
say
for
example,
the
institution
comes
back
and
it
says
we
haven't
been
able
to
talk
to
him,
but
on
the
other
hand
we
been
able
to
gain
some
valuable
information
by
watching
him.
on
the
other
because
of
scarcity
of
personnel
we
have
been
only
been
able
to
watch
for
a
limited
number
of
months.
if
we
could
have
two
more
months
to
watch
in
i
think
we
will
able
to
come
in
with
a
recommendation.
it
might
will
be
that
would
not
be
so
unreasonable
as
to
be
a
constitutional
violation.
i
do
not
think
you
can
lay
down
on
a
flat
rule
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
because
if
so
long
as
they
report
back
within
six
months
i
think
if
the
court
were
to
make
a
finding
that
they
were
entitled
to
look
at
him
again,
it
could
well
be
extended.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
if
the
judge
were
to
find
that
he
was
refusing
to
cooperate
on
purely
arbitrary
grounds
with
no
grounds
at
all
and
he
were
so
to
inform
the
man,
so
that
the
man
would
have
a
judicial
finding
that
the
grounds
that
he
was
asserting
for
refusing
to
cooperate
were
invalid
and
it
might
will
be
that
in
effect
they
would
be
giving
him
a
second
chance
to
cooperate
and
he
might
or
might
not.
but
in
this
case
where
the
man
is
refusing
to
cooperate
because
of
the
questions
that
they
were
trying
to
ask
him
would
be
violating
the
peace
amendment
to
do
this.
then
i
very
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
is
not
going
to
order
him
back
to
answer
because
the
reason
is
the
same
and
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
conceivably
get
around
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
would
be
taking
the
position
here
even
if
his
criminal
sentence
had
not
expired
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
judicial
hearing
when
they
refused
to
do
anything
with
him
except
to
say
that
he
can
be
kept
indefinitely,
but
i
think
this.
that
once
his
sentence
has
been
served
whatever
excuse
there
may
have
been
up
until
that
period
for
keeping
him
whether
they
want
to
look
at
him
some
more
or
whether
they
want
to
give
him
more
chances
to
talk
or
whatever,
totally
disappeared
because
at
that
point
he
has
served
his
debt
to
society,
the
period
for
them
to
report
for
holding
a
hearing
is
long
since
gone.
let
me
show
you
why
they
do
not
have
a
hearing,
mr.
justice.
they
do
not
have
a
hearing
because
there
is
nothing
they
can
get
out
of
it.
if
they
hold
a
hearing
and
he
said
that
not
to
be
a
defective
delinquent,
he
goes
free.
if
they
hold
a
hearing
and
he
is
to
determined
to
be
a
defective
delinquent,
what
does
he
get,
he
gets
precisely
the
sentence
his
got
right
now
which
is
an
indefinite
confinement.
they
claim
they
can
keep
him
for
life
because
he
refuses
to
answer
these
incriminating
questions
so
why
hold
a
hearing.
from
their
standpoint,
they
have
got
him
forever.
the
only
way
he
can
get
out
of
the
receiving
tier
and
get
a
report
is
by
saying
yes,
i
stolen
the
cookies
in
high
school
and
i
might
say
parenthetically
it
is
rather
odd,
but
in
maryland
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
at
all
on
any
crime
for
which
you
can
be
sentenced
to
prison.
they
can
go
back
when
the
man
is
80-years
old
and
convict
him
for
something
he
did
when
he
was
25.
so
it
is
a
very
real
and
serious
problem
for
this
man
where
they
are
saying,
didn't
you
really
steel
these
shoes
and
look
at
what
the
fbi
report
says.
we
know
you
were
not
convicted
of
this,
but
tell
us
weren't
you
really
and
then
they
go
in,
they
actually
go
into
the
defective
delinquency
hearing
and
testify
about
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
for
any
crime
for
which
you
can
be
sentenced
to
prison.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
would
be
a
petitioner
in
murel,
probably
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
would
be
adapting
probably
many
of
the
objections
of
the
system
that
mr.
murel
and
the
other
petitioners
had,
but
this
i
want
to
emphasize
is
a
very,
very
different
case.
it
was
more
like
avey,
only
mr.
avey
died
and
therefore
that
issue
wasn't
before
you
there,
but
it
is
more
akin
to
that
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
not
necessarily
because
as
in
the
mckenzie
case
that
may
find
you
to
be
a
defective
delinquent
anyway,
if
they
have
a
proper
record
and
can
uphold
that.
i
must
say
in
this
case
they
say
in
their
brief
that
they
do
not
have
enough
evidence
to
hold
him,
to
find
him
to
be
a
defective
delinquent,
but
let
me
point
out
to
you.
what
do
they
say
they
have
got?
they
do
not
even
show
that
they
have
talked
to
his
family
and
friends
and
schoolmates
as
all
of
the
evidence
in
murel
they
gave
--
they
say
when
it
sound
like
about
this
extraordinary
investigation
that
they
conduct
in
order
to
get
his
full
folder
on
somebody,
they
had
six
years
to
get
that
kind
of
a
folder
on
this
man
and
they
do
not
even
show
in
his
file
that
they
done
what
they
have
been
so
proud
off
elsewhere
and
they
say
they
cannot
find
him
to
be
a
defective
delinquent
on
this
record.
and
i
say
alright
you
had
your
chance
for
six
years,
now
he
is
entitled
to
release.
i
did
have
a
more
points,
but
your
honor
i
would
like
to
say
sometime
for
rebuttal.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh!
if
he
could
be
civilly
committed,
possible
if
he
is
qualified.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
under
the
civil
commitments
you
have
different
standards
than
you
do
here.
i
think
the
man
is
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
it
certainly
isn't.
he
would
have
to
be
a
psychotic
and
one
of
the
interesting
things
is
that
the
referral
report
here
specifically
said
they
did
not
think
he
was
delinquent.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
so,
i
do
not
think
they
could.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
please
the
court,
in
view
of
the
concessions
made
by
the
state
let
me
just
make
one
last
point
in
regard
to
the
remedy.
the
reason
i
indicated
that
i
think
the
man
ought
to
be
ordered
immediately
released
as
opposed
to
just
having
a
hearing
at
this
point
is
this.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
state
has
said
in
their
brief
that
they
cannot
find
him
to
be
a
defective
delinquent
based
on
this
record,
in
view
with
the
fact
that
i
as
his
attorney
i
am
not
about
to
telling
him
that
he
should
incriminate
himself
based
on
the
state's
assurance
to
this
court
that
they
do
not
plan
to
convict
him
on
the
basis
of
what
he
is
going
to
say,
a
hearing
would
be
a
wasted
gesture.
he
has
now
serve
his
full
criminal
term.
i
can
read
you
from
cases
where
things
that
these
fellows
have
said
in
the
course
these
interviews
have
then
been
used
in
court
to
keep
them
in
patuxent
indefinitely
and
moreover
we
have
no
idea
how
in
view
with
fact
that
what
he
says
goes
right
into
his
file
which
is
open
to
the
prosecutor,
the
information
that
he
gives
could
not
be
used
as
a
link
to
chain
to
prosecute
him
later.
they
are
all
kinds
of
holes
in
this
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
say
three
things
one.
while
his
original
sentence
was
still
open
they
could
use
it
to
re-convict
him
that
is
no
longer
true
here,
but
that
is
in
other
cases.
number
two,
they
could
convict
him
now
and
at
any
time
for
anything
that
he
confessed
to
in
the
course
of
this
interrogation
in
which
they
would
get
evidence
out
of
this
file
and
number
three,
without
any
question
they
would
use
it
to
keep
him
in
patuxent
indefinitely
because
just
to
read
you
in
the
daniel’s
case
a
very
brief.
this
is
man
convicted
of
house
breaking
and
larceny
and
when
they
tried
to
keep
him
in
they
give
evidence
of
sexual
behavior
of
the
inmate
used
and
the
court
said
that
was
alright,
they
could
used
that
as
evidence
to
keep
him
indefinitely
with
patuxent
without
any
relationship
to
his
original
crime.
of
course
they
are
going
to
use
it
in
that
is
file
would
never
tell
this
man
to
talk
and
why
therefore
i
think
a
hearing
of
this
stage
is
a
wasted
gesture,
why
his
entitled
to
immediate
release.
thank
you.
