chief

warren
e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
71-5144,
mcneil
against
patuxent.
mr.
prettyman
we
are
going
to
let
you
gentleman
finish
your
case
now
before
we
take
lunch.
you
may
go
right
through.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
have
any
way
of
knowing
mr.
prettyman
whether
some
of
that
information
the
judge
was
acting
on
came
out
of
the
so
called
probation
report,
the
pre-sentence
report?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
--
would
it
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
had
he
cooperated
with
the
psychiatric
people
at
patuxent,
that
this
determination
could
have
been
made
on
the
ordinary
course?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
prettyman,
i
am
surprised
that
you
would
press
the
point
that
a
psychiatric
examination,
useful
dimensions
can
be
made
if
the
subject,
the
patient
refuses
to
answer
any
questions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
answer
goes
to
the
judicial
response
to
this
problem,
not
to
the
medical
one
that
i
was
driving
at.
i
have
never
thought
anyone
would
seriously
contend
that
you
can
make
an
adequate
psychiatric
examination
in
every
case.
the
patient
who
will
not
answer
any
questions,
i
am
not
talking
about
catatonic
patient
or
some
patient
who
needs,
no
--
very
sophisticated
diagnosis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
some
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
clears
the
air,
at
least
for
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
time?
how
long
must
he
--
how
long
would
you
think
they
can
keep
him
in
patuxent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
assuming
that
they
could
him
therapy
without
talking
to
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
really
on
the
speculation,
the
way
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
assuming
that
the
therapy
would
begin
on
a
clean
slate
without
knowing
what
his
--
what
diagnosis
to
make
mr.
prettyman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
isn't
therapy
--
doesn't
therapy
first
call
for
a
diagnosis.
how
do
they
make
a
diagnosis
without
asking
him
questions
about
his
parents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
goes
to
your
point
that
after
six
months
in
any
event
he
had
to
go
back
to
the
business.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
--
under
the
maryland
statute,
would
the
maryland
court
judge
having
that
hearing
after
the
six
months
in
patuxent
have
the
power
and
authority
to
say,
well
i
think
we
will
try
this
again
so
we
are
going
to
send
you
back
for
another
90
days
or
six
months
outside
limit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
violate
the
statute
to
do
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
judge
just
said
here
to
this
man
that
you
have
not
cooperated.
we
cannot
help
you
until
you
do.
i
am
going
to
send
you
back
for
another
six
months.
is
that
permitted?
let
us
lay
aside
the
constitution
for
a
minute,
the
maryland
statute
permits
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
prettyman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lord?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
had
been
sent
back
at
the
end
of
the
first
six
months
with
a
report
that
he
had
refused
to
cooperate
on
five
or
several
occasions
or
whatever
it
might
have
been
at
that
time,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
prettyman's
analysis
that
the
district
judge
would
have
the
discretion
to
send
him
back
for
further
examination
at
patuxent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
anything
on
it
one
way
or
the
other.
it
is
just
little
not
speculating
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
certainly
gives
a
traditional
audit
of
the
custody
every
six
months.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
maryland
solve
this
problem
with
the
statute
like
the
district
of
columbia
code,
i
do
not
think
it
is
some
on
federal
statute
to
the
effect
of
nothing
disclosed
in
the
psychiatric
examination
maybe
used
anywhere,
wouldn't
that
solve
the
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now
you
cannot
control
the
legislature
but
that
will
solve
the
problem.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
not
see
at
least
a
(inaudible)
value
in
requiring
a
judicial
inquiry
every
six
months
under
the
statute
which
the
statute
seems
to
contemplate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
statute
that
could
have
been
done
every
six
months,
for
about
six
years,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
find
that
you
just
--
that
would
require
to
sit
back
and
wait
for
him
to
commit
three
or
four
crimes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
thought
mr.
prettyman
was
asking
that
he
would
be
release
tomorrow.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
or
without
a
hearing.
mr.
prettyman’s
point
is
that
they
now
having
serve
to
full
five
years
must
be
released
forth
with,
hearing
or
no
hearing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
without
regard
to
his
safety
to
society
or
anything
else,
that
had
to
be
mr.
prettyman’s
position.
chief
