mr.
henry
r.
lord
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
full
text
of
the
statute,
article
31
(b)
is
set
out
in
the
murel
brief
of
the
state
and
it
is
not
been
reprinted
in
these
briefs.
only
those
excerpts
which
are
directly
bearing
on
the
outcome
of
disposition
of
the
particular
arguments
made
by
the
petitioner.
now,
before
i
get
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
privilege
against
self
incrimination
which
i
think
is
a
pivotable
point
in
this
argument
of
the
petitioner,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
transfer
in
july
of
1966
or
august
of
1966
of
the
petitioner
to
patuxent
was
a
valid
transfer
under
any
fair
reading
of
the
cases
of
this
court
or
the
cases
of
the
circuit
courts
and
appeal.
now
mr.
mcneil
was
convicted
of
committing
two
crimes,
either
one
of
which
is
a
threshold
crime
under
section
6
(a)
of
the
defective
delinquency
statute.
one
was
assault
upon
a
police
officer
which
under
section
6
(a)
is
a
crime
of
violence,
a
threshold
crime
triggering
the
operation
of
the
statute.
the
second
crime
was
attempted
rape
under
section
6
(a)
(4)
a
sex
crime
involving
physical
force
or
violence.
now,
there
was
a
conviction
on
both
charges.
the
sentence,
it
is
true
was
five
years.
the
sentence
of
course
was
discretionary
with
the
trial
judge.
the
case
was
heard
now-jury
and
upon
a
point
that
i
hope
to
return
to
later
in
an
argument,
the
sentence
clearly
could
have
been
at
least
25
years
if
the
maximum
had
been
imposed
and
if
the
sentences
had
been
in
the
two
indictments
to
run
consecutively
rather
than
concurrently.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
demonstrate
that
your
honor.
the
next
thing
the
judge
did
was
based
upon
his
personal
observation
of
the
defendant
during
the
course
of
this
trial.
he
felt
that
he
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
psychiatric
examination
was
necessary.
in
fact
he
ordered
an
immediate
psychiatric
examination
by
the
medical
officer,
dr.
john
sheen
of
the
supreme
bench
of
baltimore
city.
now,
dr.
sheen's
report
is
very
interesting
because
in
the
three
respects
it
comports
exactly
with
the
definition
of
defective
delinquency.
i
do
not
think
that
this
was
annulling
or
conscious
effort
on
dr.
sheen’s
heart,
but
if
you
will
turn
to
page
23
of
the
respondent's
brief
dr.
sheen’s
report
is
set
out
in
full.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
23
your
honor.
now,
dr.
sheen
found
after
examination
that
the
petitioner
had
an
unstable
character
structure
compares
to
section
5
with
the
definition
of
the
defective
delinquency
which
talks
in
terms
of
emotional
imbalance.
he
also
found
that
there
was
“rigidity
of
defenses
making
it
which
was
a
pessimistic
sign
that
further
offenses
may
occur,”
compare
the
statute
of
the
definition
which
talks
in
terms
of
whether
the
defendant
evidences
a
propensity
toward
criminal
activity.
and
finally,
he
said
that
the
petitioner,
defendant
there
was
certainly
a
danger
to
society,
compare
again
the
definition
of
defective
delinquency
which
requires
that
the
petitioner
clearly
demonstrate
an
actual
danger
to
society.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
do
not
think
that's
exactly
right,
but
it
is
a
point
that
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
he
was
asked
to
be
treat,
psychiatrically
examine
and
the
recommendation
of
the
psychiatrist
was
that
if
you
transfer
and
that
is
in
report,
to
patuxent
for
evaluation.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
very
well.
i
would
simply
think
that
he
would
have.
but
this
was
in
the
nature
of
pre
sentence
investigation
and
the
court
had
perfectly
adequate
grounds
for
ordering
it.
now
after
personal
observation
of
the
defendant,
knowledge
of
his
past
activities,
no
criminal
record
but
some
record
of
criminal
involved
went
under
unique
maryland
practice
called
probation
before
verdict
for
two
charges
assault
and
robbery
and
rape,
this
was
all
before
the
court.
the
psychiatrist
report
was
before
the
court
and
at
that
point
the
court
found
that
he
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
petitioner
was
a
defective
delinquent.
he
then
ordered
him
and
the
terms
of
the
order
are
in
a
footnote
on
page
6
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
the
white
brief,
he
ordered
that
the
petitioner
be
transferred
to
the
custody
of
the
director
of
the
patuxent
institution
for
observation,
examination
and
evaluation
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
he
is
a
defective
delinquent.
now,
i
should
say
because
this
came
up
in
the
murel
argument
that
98%
of
the
referrals
to
patuxent
or
court
initiated
immediately
after
conviction
of
an
offense
and
so
this
is
not
an
unusual
type
of
practice
at
all.
the
other
2%
are
initiated
by
the
various
others
sources.
mr.
justice
marshall
mentioned
in
the
last
argument
that
the
department
of
correction
can
initiate
or
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
be
a
transfer,
but
of
course
it
always
done
under
court
order.
so
we
have
a
transfer
by
court
order
on
reasonable
cause.
now
at
patuxent,
there
is
of
course
evaluation.
there
are
no
cases
that
i
am
suggest
that
not
lynch
versus
overholser
or
beckstrom
or
spect
or
humphrey
or
even
indeed
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
case
of
matthew’s
which
suggests
that
there
was
anything
constitutionally
improper
about
the
method
used
by
the
judge
here
to
order
the
transfer
for
evaluation
in
virtually
all
cases
a
temporary
transfer,
of
the
petitioner
here
and
no
short
comings
in
the
maryland
procedures
there.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
it
is
raised
here
and
it
becomes
important
because
if
the
transfer
in
the
first
instance
was
illegal
or
unconstitutional
then
other
things
may
float
from
the
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
think
certain
aspects
of
petitioner’s
brief
raise
it,
but
i
did
want
to
just
emphasize
that
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes
whether
it
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right.
i
suggest
that
full
dress
adversary
judicial
hearing
is
necessary
before
there
is
even
a
transfer
for
evaluation
in
the
court.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes
that
is
one
of
the
issues
in
murel.
now,
there
is
also
reference
to
the
federal
statute,
section
4241
of
title
18.
i
suggest
in
passing
that
the
maryland
statute
on
this
point
provides
more
due
process
protections
than
does
that
federal
statute.
bear
in
mind
that
if
a
man
has
a
25-year
sentence
under
the
federal
statute,
he
never
has
any
judicially
supervised
transfer
or
indeed
a
full
dress
judicial
hearing
until
the
25th
year.
he
is
transferred
by
essentially
an
administrative
act
from
a
penitentiary
to
a
hospital.
there
is
no
hearing
and
no
court
action
even
on
the
act
of
signing
the
court
order.
now,
of
course
we
are
not
getting
in
this
case
to
the
whole
question
of
the
due
process
surroundings
of
the
subsequent
hearing
for
defective
delinquency
because
for
reasons
which
i
will
soon
get
into
there
has
not
been
one
here.
now,
once
at
patuxent,
we
now
find
that
a
sort
of
state
of
suspended
animation
has
taken
place
with
respect
to
this
particular
petitioner.
he
is
been
there
for
five
years
and
eight
months.
he
has
never
been
evaluated.
he
has
never
had
his
defective
delinquency
hearing.
he
has
never
had
any
treatment
because
diagnosis
has
been
impossible.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes,
your
honor.
the
statute
makes
the
assumption,
i
think
it
just
cries
out
from
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute,
that
there
would
be
cooperation.
i
do
not
really
the
draftsmen
ever
contemplated
the
kind
of
situation
we're
dealing
with
here
and
hence
the
requirement
that
a
six
months
period
must
--
at
the
end
of
that
there
must
be
a
report
back
to
the
court
contemplates
that
there
can
be
a
diagnosis,
a
kind
of
report
made.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
problem
at
all
about
the
court
extending
that
time
further
if
there
is
any
reasonable
chance
that
the
result
is
going
to
be
any
different
at
the
end
of
another
fixed
period
and
that's
what
troubles
me
about
your
honor's
suggestion.
there
is
no
reason
for
the
state
to
believe
that
if
at
the
end
of
six
months
the
petitioner
has
accomplished
his
purposes
in
not
having
a
diagnosis
that
he
suddenly
going
to
have
a
change
of
heart
in
the
second
six
months
or
the
third
six
months.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
agree,
but
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
true
and
i
agree
that
to
put
this
state
to
the
requirement
of
having
an
immediate
hearing
at
that
point
would
clearly
be
unsatisfactory
result
from
the
state
standpoint.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well
bear
in
mind
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
mr.
prettyman
pointed
at
the
whole
definition
of
defective
delinquency
is
geared
towards
propensity
towards
criminal
activity.
there
maybe
other
ways
of
identifying
not
other
than
asking
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
right.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
of
course.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
as
far
as
the
record
indicates,
no.
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
in
the
record
one
way
or
another
of
what
types
of
questions
he
refused
to
answer.
it
simply
says
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
let
me
come
right
to
that
point
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right.
he,
so
his
whole
basis
has
to
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
not
necessarily.
he
tomorrow
may
change
his
attitude
on
these
whole
question.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
true.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
absolutely
right
because
the
statute
requires
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
the
state
contends
that
he
has
no
fifth
amendment
right.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
wouldn't
say
that
he
lost
it
at
all.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
he
had
a
fifth
amendment
right
in
the
criminal
proceeding.
he
does
not
have
its
amendment
right
in
his
proceedings
at
patuxent.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
but
mr.
justice
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
the
question
of
why
has
this
happened
and
it
is
happened
because
there
has
been
an
inability
because
of
petitioner's
actions
and
i
think
all
parties
agree
here
is
because
of
the
petitioner's
actions,
there
has
been
an
inability
to
carry
out
the
statutory
requirements.
now,
if
you
were
suggesting
to
the
state
that
by
this
lack
of
cooperation,
conscious
plan,
continuing
life
of
cooperation,
the
whole
structure
at
patuxent
not
just
for
petitioner
here,
but
for
every
person
who
is
referred
for
evaluation,
that
this
is
an
available
remedy,
the
first
way
to
patuxent
proceeding
i
suggest
that
the
state
strongly
objects
to
that.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
i
suggest
that
there
are
a
number
of
solutions.
i
think
most
of
which
both
stated,
this
court
would
find
to
be
unsatisfactory
which
would
require
--
would
break
the
circle
here
i
think.
now,
the
most
obvious
one
is
that
at
that
point
in
time
when
a
man's
sentence
is
about
to
expire
or
at
that
point
in
time
at
the
end
of
six
months
when
a
report
because
of
non-cooperation
has
been
impossible,
the
petitioner
is
brought
back
before
the
court
and
bear
in
mind
that
the
order
transferring
him
runs
to
the
institution,
he
is
put
under
a
specific
order
directly
in
court
to
cooperate
with
the
diagnostic
procedures
at
patuxent
institution
and
his
failure
subsequently
to
so
cooperate
would
bring
about
convictions
of
contempt
to
court,
probably
direct
criminal
contempt
to
court.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
maryland
statute
that
would
provide
it,
but
the
states
suggests
to
this
court
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
will
prevent
it
either.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
the
problem
of
course
is,
i
must
say
of
course
it
is
a
new
subject
and
i
do
not
think
that
i
can
point
to
any
particular
case
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
i
do
not
think
so
because
of
the
situation
here
that
the
statute
is
written
for
the
protection
of
the
petitioner
and
for
reasons
known
only
to
him
he
has
elected
not
to
allow
that
statute
to
operate.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
i
think
i
will
clarify
that.
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
for
all
misdemeanors
in
maryland
of
one
year.
for
all
non-misdemeanors
there
is
no
statute
or
for
a
felony
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations.
the
business
about
imprisonment
more
accurately
could
be
stated
as
follows.
for
felonies
as
a
general
rule
the
sentence
upon
conviction
is
to
the
maryland
penitentiary.
for
all
other
offenses
they
may
go
to
other
facilities
in
the
state
and
so
for
those
offenses
which
can
lead
to
incarceration
of
the
maryland
penitentiary,
namely
felonies,
all
felonies
there
is
no
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
think
i
can
respond
to
that
very
quickly.
it
is
covered
at
number
pages
of
the
brief
and
i
think
could
have
been
considerably
shortened.
miranda
versus
arizona
plus
the
point
of
view
of
the
staff
at
patuxent
plus
the
guarantee
that
i
herewith
deliver
to
this
court
would
bind
the
state
of
maryland
that
evidence
obtained
during
the
course
of
psychiatric
evaluation
for
diagnosis
at
patuxent
will
not
be
used
by
the
state
of
maryland
in
any
subsequent
criminal
proceeding
and
i
think
that
the
lower
court's
opinion.
judge
watkins
opinion
in
the
sas
case,
the
record
of
which
is
part
of
the
murel
record
and
hence
part
of
this
record
also
bears
that
point
out.
i
just
do
not
think
it
needs
any
further
attention.
it
has
not
happen
in
17
years
and
the
state
feels
bound
under
miranda,
the
extension
of
miranda
that
it
could
not
happen
in
the
future.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
it
would
be
the
state's
attorneys
and
we
have
all
the
appeals
for
convictions
for
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
we
could
refuse
to
release
the
records
of
patuxent
institution
to
the
prosecutors
and
we
will
do
that
in
fact
have
done
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
if
they
can't
get
to
the
records
they
cannot
use
the
records.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
because,
you
mean
under
article
59
of
the
maryland
code
which
provides
for
an
involuntary
commitment
to
private
mental
and
to
public
mental
institutions?
mr.
henry
r.
lord
the
point
--
the
state's
right
here
and
the
right
is
really
the
right
asserted
in
murel.
the
right
to
treats
people
who
demonstrate
criminal,
antisocial
behavior
to
be
treated
in
a
particular
facility
that
has
demonstrated
an
ability
to
solve
this
problem.
i
do
not
think
it
is
any
answer
to
the
state
to
suggest
because
of
the
whimsy
of
the
trail
judge
you
may
have
sentence
the
man
for
two
years,
another
trial
judge
would
have
sentenced
him
to
10
or
20.
that
something
magic
happens
at
the
end
of
that
sentence
and
he
suddenly
becomes
a
free
man
because
his
managed
to
fend
off
the
operation
of
a
valid
state
interest
for
the
term
presents.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
answer
to
say
well
then
we
can
meet
them
at
the
gate
of
the
patuxent
institution
and
whisk
him
off
to
state
mental
institution.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
of
course
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
am
troubled
by
that
very
point
and
we
are
groping
for
an
answer
to
that
very
question.
the
statute
does
not
provide
it.
i
do
not
think
that
any
of
us
would
say
that
there
is
any
case
that
provides
a
clear
answer.
the
state
is
perfectly
prepared
to
have
a
proper
hearing
if
also
attendant
to
it
is
the
right
which
the
state
feels
it
has
to
inquire
into
the
mental
state
of
this
individual.
when
the
state
has
no
interest
in
keeping
a
man
indefinitely
and
not
treating
him
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
institution
at
all.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
if
this
court
holds
that
in
this
case
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
the
right
to
be
returned
to
court
and
the
state
by
a
court
proceeding
is
given
the
right
to
examine
this
petitioner
and
this
must
be
done
at
the
very
latest
at
the
expiration
of
his
sentence
that
would
be
entirely
a
satisfactory
result
which
would
not
be
satisfactory.
it
is
simply
to
say
you
must
have
a
hearing
and
not
give
the
state
the
tools
to
come
up
with
the
data
at
which
at
the
hearing
where
it
bears
the
burden
of
proving
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
this
man
is
a
defective
delinquent.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
absolutely
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes
now
the
point
is
that
the
statute
requires
evaluation
by
a
medical
doctor,
psychiatrist
and
a
psychologist
and
i
think
that
the
record
is
clear
when
you
go
to
the
affidavits
and
question
are
not,
the
record,
combined
record
on
this
case
is
absolutely
clear
that
a
personal
interview
and
cooperation
is
not
necessarily
trust
but
cooperation,
interaction
so
that
you
can
answer.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
right,
exactly
right.
now,
the
state
believes
that
it's
stated
repeatedly
and
the
psychiatrist
and
psychologists
of
the
institution
believe
that
this
kind
of
diagnosis
simply
cannot
be
made
unless
there
is
this
cooperation.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
not
to
my
knowledge
and
nor
in
under
the
federal
statute
to
my
knowledge
there
has
been
no
complaint.
now
the
petitioner
argues
that
the
federal
statute
provides
a
hearing
for
mandates,
a
hearing
at
the
end
of
the
man's
sentence
to
require
him
to
be
kept
beyond
his
sentence
and
there
it
must
be
proven
that
there
is
some
doubt
that
as
to
whether
you
feel
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
--
a
threat
to
the
state
or
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
do
not.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
true
and
i
have
said
earlier
in
argument
that
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
for
him
not
to
answer
those
questions.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
it
would
but
your
honor
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
wait
for
the
maryland
legislature
to
decide
whether
not
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
would
have
solved
it,
but
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
go
that
far
in
order
to
solve
it
because
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
we
say
we
have
it.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
certainly
is
not.
now
we
are
stripping
away
the
reasons
for
non-cooperation.
now
the
other
reasons
for
non-cooperation
i
think
the
only
fair
reason,
fairly
debatable,
arguable
reason
is
that
there
maybe
a
possibility
of
further
commitment.
this
may
give
grounds
to
the
psychiatrist
for
forming
a
conclusion
that
the
man
is
a
defective
delinquent
and
may
also
extend
the
time
that
he
spends
at
patuxent
if
at
the
hearing
he
is
found
to
be
a
defective
delinquent,
but
these
are
not
criminal
ramifications.
they
involve
some
laws
of
liberty.
surely,
in
that
he
may
be
kept
beyond
his
sentence,
but
the
state
has
a
right
to
know
the
conditions
of
this
man's
mind
before
he
is
released
to
society.
the
good
example
is
right
into
the
petitioner's
brief.
there
is
an
example
given
by
doctor
goodmarker
of
a
man
who
upon
cooperation
with
the
psychiatrist
he
had
been
in
for
two
convictions
of
perverted
practices.
he
admitted
to
a
psychiatrist
that
he
had
engaged
in
this
act
with
young
boys
on
200
or
more
occasions.
now,
the
state
has
not
going
to
turn
around
and
prosecute
him
for
those
200
violations,
but
the
state
has
a
right
to
know
that
fact
and
the
state
has
a
right
to
take
that
into
consideration
when
deciding
whether
in
fact
he
should
be
diagnosed
as
a
defective
delinquent
and
in
fact
he
should
be
kept
until
some
treatment
has
relieved
him
of
this
obsession
which
leads
him
to
do
these
kinds
of
things.
he
is
a
danger
to
society
at
that
point
in
time.
now,
aside
from
the
suggestion
of
the
chief
justice
that
there
be
periodic
review
by
the
court
and
my
suggestion
that
for
contempt
there
are
other
alternatives,
but
i
want
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
they
are
simply
not
satisfactory.
we
can
be
put
to
the
test
of
coming
up
with
the
diagnosis
it
is
purely
speculative.
a
blind,
so
called
blind
diagnosis,
that
helps
no
one,
probably
violates
the
vagueness
rules
of
this
court
with
respect
to
standards
or
applications
of
standards.
you
can
encourage
trial
courts
if
something
magic
happens
at
the
expiration
of
the
five-year
sentence.
talk
would
simply
to
avoid
the
operation
of
this
one
post
maximum
sentence
or
longer
sentences.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
your
honor,
i
would
go
further
than
that.
i
would
say
that
at
the
end
of
six
months,
the
state
should
have
a
right
to
have
the
petitioner
return
to
the
court
and
advised
that
he
has
not
cooperative
during
the
six
month
period
and
he
must
cooperate
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
think
it
could
have,
but
you
know
the
staff
is
operating
once
again
in
a
gray
area
here
and
i
think
they
probably
were
very
reluctant
to
go
ahead
and
take
definitive
action
with
respect
to
a
particular
person
until
they
had
a
properly
framed
case,
we
now
have
it
and
i
think
another
ramification
could
be
that
we
just
repeal
article
31
(b)
and
pass
what
this
court
has
upheld
many
times
an
habitual
criminal
statute,
automatic
knee-jerk
reaction,
third
conviction
he
gets
the
maximum.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
fourth
conviction
and
he
gets
life.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
true.
he
was
a
young
man.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right,
that
is
right
and
would
not
guarantee
any
treatment
to
the
man.
he
would
be
subjected
upon
multiple
offenses
to
life
imprisonment
without
benefit
of
parole.
that
is
no
answer.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
your
honor,
i
think
it
really
does
not.
in
this
case
the
state
will
be
glad
to
give
him
the
hearing.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no,
if
we
have
a
court
hearing,
if
we
have
a
court
hearing
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
alright,
i
have
said
that
the
state
would
be
delighted
tomorrow
to
provide
a
hearing
to
this
petitioner
if
it
could
be
given
the
tools
to
make
the
evaluation
necessary
under
the
statute.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
true.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
he
is
it.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that's
his
position
and
the
state
simply
cannot
accept
it.
i
did
not
get
a
chance
to
mention
that
there
is
excellent
language
in
lipscomb
case
from
california
and
a
judge
sobeloff's
separate
opinion
in
the
tipitt
case
on
the
very
subject
of
the
state's
right
to
inquire
into
this
man's
mind
or
--
and
finally
i
am
struck
by
a
quote
from
mr.
justice
brandice
in
the
new
state
ice
versus
liebmann
case
in
which
he
said
it
is
one
of
the
happy
incidents
of
the
federal
system
that
a
single
of
courageous
state
can
engage
in
innovative
and
humanitarian
experimentation
in
the
social
and
economic
field.
the
state
of
maryland
is
out
front
here
and
i
think
i
submit
that
many
of
the
reasons
that
were
been
before
this
court
twice
in
the
last
month
is
simply
that
and
i
think
we
are
in
an
area
where
new
ground
is
passed
to
be
broken
for
the
benefit
of
everyone.
thank
you.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes
it
is
your
honor.
it
is
called
people
versus
lipscomb.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
full
text
of
the
statute,
article
31
(b)
is
set
out
in
the
murel
brief
of
the
state
and
it
is
not
been
reprinted
in
these
briefs.
only
those
excerpts
which
are
directly
bearing
on
the
outcome
of
disposition
of
the
particular
arguments
made
by
the
petitioner.
now,
before
i
get
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
privilege
against
self
incrimination
which
i
think
is
a
pivotable
point
in
this
argument
of
the
petitioner,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
transfer
in
july
of
1966
or
august
of
1966
of
the
petitioner
to
patuxent
was
a
valid
transfer
under
any
fair
reading
of
the
cases
of
this
court
or
the
cases
of
the
circuit
courts
and
appeal.
now
mr.
mcneil
was
convicted
of
committing
two
crimes,
either
one
of
which
is
a
threshold
crime
under
section
6
(a)
of
the
defective
delinquency
statute.
one
was
assault
upon
a
police
officer
which
under
section
6
(a)
is
a
crime
of
violence,
a
threshold
crime
triggering
the
operation
of
the
statute.
the
second
crime
was
attempted
rape
under
section
6
(a)
(4)
a
sex
crime
involving
physical
force
or
violence.
now,
there
was
a
conviction
on
both
charges.
the
sentence,
it
is
true
was
five
years.
the
sentence
of
course
was
discretionary
with
the
trial
judge.
the
case
was
heard
now-jury
and
upon
a
point
that
i
hope
to
return
to
later
in
an
argument,
the
sentence
clearly
could
have
been
at
least
25
years
if
the
maximum
had
been
imposed
and
if
the
sentences
had
been
in
the
two
indictments
to
run
consecutively
rather
than
concurrently.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
demonstrate
that
your
honor.
the
next
thing
the
judge
did
was
based
upon
his
personal
observation
of
the
defendant
during
the
course
of
this
trial.
he
felt
that
he
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
psychiatric
examination
was
necessary.
in
fact
he
ordered
an
immediate
psychiatric
examination
by
the
medical
officer,
dr.
john
sheen
of
the
supreme
bench
of
baltimore
city.
now,
dr.
sheen's
report
is
very
interesting
because
in
the
three
respects
it
comports
exactly
with
the
definition
of
defective
delinquency.
i
do
not
think
that
this
was
annulling
or
conscious
effort
on
dr.
sheen’s
heart,
but
if
you
will
turn
to
page
23
of
the
respondent's
brief
dr.
sheen’s
report
is
set
out
in
full.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
23
your
honor.
now,
dr.
sheen
found
after
examination
that
the
petitioner
had
an
unstable
character
structure
compares
to
section
5
with
the
definition
of
the
defective
delinquency
which
talks
in
terms
of
emotional
imbalance.
he
also
found
that
there
was
“rigidity
of
defenses
making
it
which
was
a
pessimistic
sign
that
further
offenses
may
occur,”
compare
the
statute
of
the
definition
which
talks
in
terms
of
whether
the
defendant
evidences
a
propensity
toward
criminal
activity.
and
finally,
he
said
that
the
petitioner,
defendant
there
was
certainly
a
danger
to
society,
compare
again
the
definition
of
defective
delinquency
which
requires
that
the
petitioner
clearly
demonstrate
an
actual
danger
to
society.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
do
not
think
that's
exactly
right,
but
it
is
a
point
that
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
he
was
asked
to
be
treat,
psychiatrically
examine
and
the
recommendation
of
the
psychiatrist
was
that
if
you
transfer
and
that
is
in
report,
to
patuxent
for
evaluation.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
very
well.
i
would
simply
think
that
he
would
have.
but
this
was
in
the
nature
of
pre
sentence
investigation
and
the
court
had
perfectly
adequate
grounds
for
ordering
it.
now
after
personal
observation
of
the
defendant,
knowledge
of
his
past
activities,
no
criminal
record
but
some
record
of
criminal
involved
went
under
unique
maryland
practice
called
probation
before
verdict
for
two
charges
assault
and
robbery
and
rape,
this
was
all
before
the
court.
the
psychiatrist
report
was
before
the
court
and
at
that
point
the
court
found
that
he
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
petitioner
was
a
defective
delinquent.
he
then
ordered
him
and
the
terms
of
the
order
are
in
a
footnote
on
page
6
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
the
white
brief,
he
ordered
that
the
petitioner
be
transferred
to
the
custody
of
the
director
of
the
patuxent
institution
for
observation,
examination
and
evaluation
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
he
is
a
defective
delinquent.
now,
i
should
say
because
this
came
up
in
the
murel
argument
that
98%
of
the
referrals
to
patuxent
or
court
initiated
immediately
after
conviction
of
an
offense
and
so
this
is
not
an
unusual
type
of
practice
at
all.
the
other
2%
are
initiated
by
the
various
others
sources.
mr.
justice
marshall
mentioned
in
the
last
argument
that
the
department
of
correction
can
initiate
or
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
be
a
transfer,
but
of
course
it
always
done
under
court
order.
so
we
have
a
transfer
by
court
order
on
reasonable
cause.
now
at
patuxent,
there
is
of
course
evaluation.
there
are
no
cases
that
i
am
suggest
that
not
lynch
versus
overholser
or
beckstrom
or
spect
or
humphrey
or
even
indeed
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
case
of
matthew’s
which
suggests
that
there
was
anything
constitutionally
improper
about
the
method
used
by
the
judge
here
to
order
the
transfer
for
evaluation
in
virtually
all
cases
a
temporary
transfer,
of
the
petitioner
here
and
no
short
comings
in
the
maryland
procedures
there.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
it
is
raised
here
and
it
becomes
important
because
if
the
transfer
in
the
first
instance
was
illegal
or
unconstitutional
then
other
things
may
float
from
the
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
think
certain
aspects
of
petitioner’s
brief
raise
it,
but
i
did
want
to
just
emphasize
that
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes
whether
it
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right.
i
suggest
that
full
dress
adversary
judicial
hearing
is
necessary
before
there
is
even
a
transfer
for
evaluation
in
the
court.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes
that
is
one
of
the
issues
in
murel.
now,
there
is
also
reference
to
the
federal
statute,
section
4241
of
title
18.
i
suggest
in
passing
that
the
maryland
statute
on
this
point
provides
more
due
process
protections
than
does
that
federal
statute.
bear
in
mind
that
if
a
man
has
a
25-year
sentence
under
the
federal
statute,
he
never
has
any
judicially
supervised
transfer
or
indeed
a
full
dress
judicial
hearing
until
the
25th
year.
he
is
transferred
by
essentially
an
administrative
act
from
a
penitentiary
to
a
hospital.
there
is
no
hearing
and
no
court
action
even
on
the
act
of
signing
the
court
order.
now,
of
course
we
are
not
getting
in
this
case
to
the
whole
question
of
the
due
process
surroundings
of
the
subsequent
hearing
for
defective
delinquency
because
for
reasons
which
i
will
soon
get
into
there
has
not
been
one
here.
now,
once
at
patuxent,
we
now
find
that
a
sort
of
state
of
suspended
animation
has
taken
place
with
respect
to
this
particular
petitioner.
he
is
been
there
for
five
years
and
eight
months.
he
has
never
been
evaluated.
he
has
never
had
his
defective
delinquency
hearing.
he
has
never
had
any
treatment
because
diagnosis
has
been
impossible.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes,
your
honor.
the
statute
makes
the
assumption,
i
think
it
just
cries
out
from
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute,
that
there
would
be
cooperation.
i
do
not
really
the
draftsmen
ever
contemplated
the
kind
of
situation
we're
dealing
with
here
and
hence
the
requirement
that
a
six
months
period
must
--
at
the
end
of
that
there
must
be
a
report
back
to
the
court
contemplates
that
there
can
be
a
diagnosis,
a
kind
of
report
made.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
problem
at
all
about
the
court
extending
that
time
further
if
there
is
any
reasonable
chance
that
the
result
is
going
to
be
any
different
at
the
end
of
another
fixed
period
and
that's
what
troubles
me
about
your
honor's
suggestion.
there
is
no
reason
for
the
state
to
believe
that
if
at
the
end
of
six
months
the
petitioner
has
accomplished
his
purposes
in
not
having
a
diagnosis
that
he
suddenly
going
to
have
a
change
of
heart
in
the
second
six
months
or
the
third
six
months.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
agree,
but
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
true
and
i
agree
that
to
put
this
state
to
the
requirement
of
having
an
immediate
hearing
at
that
point
would
clearly
be
unsatisfactory
result
from
the
state
standpoint.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well
bear
in
mind
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
mr.
prettyman
pointed
at
the
whole
definition
of
defective
delinquency
is
geared
towards
propensity
towards
criminal
activity.
there
maybe
other
ways
of
identifying
not
other
than
asking
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
right.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
of
course.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
as
far
as
the
record
indicates,
no.
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
in
the
record
one
way
or
another
of
what
types
of
questions
he
refused
to
answer.
it
simply
says
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
let
me
come
right
to
that
point
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right.
he,
so
his
whole
basis
has
to
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
not
necessarily.
he
tomorrow
may
change
his
attitude
on
these
whole
question.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
true.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
absolutely
right
because
the
statute
requires
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
the
state
contends
that
he
has
no
fifth
amendment
right.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
wouldn't
say
that
he
lost
it
at
all.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
he
had
a
fifth
amendment
right
in
the
criminal
proceeding.
he
does
not
have
its
amendment
right
in
his
proceedings
at
patuxent.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
but
mr.
justice
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
the
question
of
why
has
this
happened
and
it
is
happened
because
there
has
been
an
inability
because
of
petitioner's
actions
and
i
think
all
parties
agree
here
is
because
of
the
petitioner's
actions,
there
has
been
an
inability
to
carry
out
the
statutory
requirements.
now,
if
you
were
suggesting
to
the
state
that
by
this
lack
of
cooperation,
conscious
plan,
continuing
life
of
cooperation,
the
whole
structure
at
patuxent
not
just
for
petitioner
here,
but
for
every
person
who
is
referred
for
evaluation,
that
this
is
an
available
remedy,
the
first
way
to
patuxent
proceeding
i
suggest
that
the
state
strongly
objects
to
that.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
i
suggest
that
there
are
a
number
of
solutions.
i
think
most
of
which
both
stated,
this
court
would
find
to
be
unsatisfactory
which
would
require
--
would
break
the
circle
here
i
think.
now,
the
most
obvious
one
is
that
at
that
point
in
time
when
a
man's
sentence
is
about
to
expire
or
at
that
point
in
time
at
the
end
of
six
months
when
a
report
because
of
non-cooperation
has
been
impossible,
the
petitioner
is
brought
back
before
the
court
and
bear
in
mind
that
the
order
transferring
him
runs
to
the
institution,
he
is
put
under
a
specific
order
directly
in
court
to
cooperate
with
the
diagnostic
procedures
at
patuxent
institution
and
his
failure
subsequently
to
so
cooperate
would
bring
about
convictions
of
contempt
to
court,
probably
direct
criminal
contempt
to
court.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
maryland
statute
that
would
provide
it,
but
the
states
suggests
to
this
court
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
will
prevent
it
either.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
the
problem
of
course
is,
i
must
say
of
course
it
is
a
new
subject
and
i
do
not
think
that
i
can
point
to
any
particular
case
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
i
do
not
think
so
because
of
the
situation
here
that
the
statute
is
written
for
the
protection
of
the
petitioner
and
for
reasons
known
only
to
him
he
has
elected
not
to
allow
that
statute
to
operate.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
i
think
i
will
clarify
that.
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
for
all
misdemeanors
in
maryland
of
one
year.
for
all
non-misdemeanors
there
is
no
statute
or
for
a
felony
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations.
the
business
about
imprisonment
more
accurately
could
be
stated
as
follows.
for
felonies
as
a
general
rule
the
sentence
upon
conviction
is
to
the
maryland
penitentiary.
for
all
other
offenses
they
may
go
to
other
facilities
in
the
state
and
so
for
those
offenses
which
can
lead
to
incarceration
of
the
maryland
penitentiary,
namely
felonies,
all
felonies
there
is
no
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
think
i
can
respond
to
that
very
quickly.
it
is
covered
at
number
pages
of
the
brief
and
i
think
could
have
been
considerably
shortened.
miranda
versus
arizona
plus
the
point
of
view
of
the
staff
at
patuxent
plus
the
guarantee
that
i
herewith
deliver
to
this
court
would
bind
the
state
of
maryland
that
evidence
obtained
during
the
course
of
psychiatric
evaluation
for
diagnosis
at
patuxent
will
not
be
used
by
the
state
of
maryland
in
any
subsequent
criminal
proceeding
and
i
think
that
the
lower
court's
opinion.
judge
watkins
opinion
in
the
sas
case,
the
record
of
which
is
part
of
the
murel
record
and
hence
part
of
this
record
also
bears
that
point
out.
i
just
do
not
think
it
needs
any
further
attention.
it
has
not
happen
in
17
years
and
the
state
feels
bound
under
miranda,
the
extension
of
miranda
that
it
could
not
happen
in
the
future.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
it
would
be
the
state's
attorneys
and
we
have
all
the
appeals
for
convictions
for
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
we
could
refuse
to
release
the
records
of
patuxent
institution
to
the
prosecutors
and
we
will
do
that
in
fact
have
done
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
if
they
can't
get
to
the
records
they
cannot
use
the
records.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
because,
you
mean
under
article
59
of
the
maryland
code
which
provides
for
an
involuntary
commitment
to
private
mental
and
to
public
mental
institutions?
mr.
henry
r.
lord
the
point
--
the
state's
right
here
and
the
right
is
really
the
right
asserted
in
murel.
the
right
to
treats
people
who
demonstrate
criminal,
antisocial
behavior
to
be
treated
in
a
particular
facility
that
has
demonstrated
an
ability
to
solve
this
problem.
i
do
not
think
it
is
any
answer
to
the
state
to
suggest
because
of
the
whimsy
of
the
trail
judge
you
may
have
sentence
the
man
for
two
years,
another
trial
judge
would
have
sentenced
him
to
10
or
20.
that
something
magic
happens
at
the
end
of
that
sentence
and
he
suddenly
becomes
a
free
man
because
his
managed
to
fend
off
the
operation
of
a
valid
state
interest
for
the
term
presents.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
answer
to
say
well
then
we
can
meet
them
at
the
gate
of
the
patuxent
institution
and
whisk
him
off
to
state
mental
institution.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
of
course
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
am
troubled
by
that
very
point
and
we
are
groping
for
an
answer
to
that
very
question.
the
statute
does
not
provide
it.
i
do
not
think
that
any
of
us
would
say
that
there
is
any
case
that
provides
a
clear
answer.
the
state
is
perfectly
prepared
to
have
a
proper
hearing
if
also
attendant
to
it
is
the
right
which
the
state
feels
it
has
to
inquire
into
the
mental
state
of
this
individual.
when
the
state
has
no
interest
in
keeping
a
man
indefinitely
and
not
treating
him
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
institution
at
all.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
if
this
court
holds
that
in
this
case
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
the
right
to
be
returned
to
court
and
the
state
by
a
court
proceeding
is
given
the
right
to
examine
this
petitioner
and
this
must
be
done
at
the
very
latest
at
the
expiration
of
his
sentence
that
would
be
entirely
a
satisfactory
result
which
would
not
be
satisfactory.
it
is
simply
to
say
you
must
have
a
hearing
and
not
give
the
state
the
tools
to
come
up
with
the
data
at
which
at
the
hearing
where
it
bears
the
burden
of
proving
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
this
man
is
a
defective
delinquent.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
absolutely
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes
now
the
point
is
that
the
statute
requires
evaluation
by
a
medical
doctor,
psychiatrist
and
a
psychologist
and
i
think
that
the
record
is
clear
when
you
go
to
the
affidavits
and
question
are
not,
the
record,
combined
record
on
this
case
is
absolutely
clear
that
a
personal
interview
and
cooperation
is
not
necessarily
trust
but
cooperation,
interaction
so
that
you
can
answer.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
right,
exactly
right.
now,
the
state
believes
that
it's
stated
repeatedly
and
the
psychiatrist
and
psychologists
of
the
institution
believe
that
this
kind
of
diagnosis
simply
cannot
be
made
unless
there
is
this
cooperation.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
not
to
my
knowledge
and
nor
in
under
the
federal
statute
to
my
knowledge
there
has
been
no
complaint.
now
the
petitioner
argues
that
the
federal
statute
provides
a
hearing
for
mandates,
a
hearing
at
the
end
of
the
man's
sentence
to
require
him
to
be
kept
beyond
his
sentence
and
there
it
must
be
proven
that
there
is
some
doubt
that
as
to
whether
you
feel
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
--
a
threat
to
the
state
or
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
do
not.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
true
and
i
have
said
earlier
in
argument
that
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
for
him
not
to
answer
those
questions.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
it
would
but
your
honor
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
wait
for
the
maryland
legislature
to
decide
whether
not
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
would
have
solved
it,
but
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
go
that
far
in
order
to
solve
it
because
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
we
say
we
have
it.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
certainly
is
not.
now
we
are
stripping
away
the
reasons
for
non-cooperation.
now
the
other
reasons
for
non-cooperation
i
think
the
only
fair
reason,
fairly
debatable,
arguable
reason
is
that
there
maybe
a
possibility
of
further
commitment.
this
may
give
grounds
to
the
psychiatrist
for
forming
a
conclusion
that
the
man
is
a
defective
delinquent
and
may
also
extend
the
time
that
he
spends
at
patuxent
if
at
the
hearing
he
is
found
to
be
a
defective
delinquent,
but
these
are
not
criminal
ramifications.
they
involve
some
laws
of
liberty.
surely,
in
that
he
may
be
kept
beyond
his
sentence,
but
the
state
has
a
right
to
know
the
conditions
of
this
man's
mind
before
he
is
released
to
society.
the
good
example
is
right
into
the
petitioner's
brief.
there
is
an
example
given
by
doctor
goodmarker
of
a
man
who
upon
cooperation
with
the
psychiatrist
he
had
been
in
for
two
convictions
of
perverted
practices.
he
admitted
to
a
psychiatrist
that
he
had
engaged
in
this
act
with
young
boys
on
200
or
more
occasions.
now,
the
state
has
not
going
to
turn
around
and
prosecute
him
for
those
200
violations,
but
the
state
has
a
right
to
know
that
fact
and
the
state
has
a
right
to
take
that
into
consideration
when
deciding
whether
in
fact
he
should
be
diagnosed
as
a
defective
delinquent
and
in
fact
he
should
be
kept
until
some
treatment
has
relieved
him
of
this
obsession
which
leads
him
to
do
these
kinds
of
things.
he
is
a
danger
to
society
at
that
point
in
time.
now,
aside
from
the
suggestion
of
the
chief
justice
that
there
be
periodic
review
by
the
court
and
my
suggestion
that
for
contempt
there
are
other
alternatives,
but
i
want
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
they
are
simply
not
satisfactory.
we
can
be
put
to
the
test
of
coming
up
with
the
diagnosis
it
is
purely
speculative.
a
blind,
so
called
blind
diagnosis,
that
helps
no
one,
probably
violates
the
vagueness
rules
of
this
court
with
respect
to
standards
or
applications
of
standards.
you
can
encourage
trial
courts
if
something
magic
happens
at
the
expiration
of
the
five-year
sentence.
talk
would
simply
to
avoid
the
operation
of
this
one
post
maximum
sentence
or
longer
sentences.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
your
honor,
i
would
go
further
than
that.
i
would
say
that
at
the
end
of
six
months,
the
state
should
have
a
right
to
have
the
petitioner
return
to
the
court
and
advised
that
he
has
not
cooperative
during
the
six
month
period
and
he
must
cooperate
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
think
it
could
have,
but
you
know
the
staff
is
operating
once
again
in
a
gray
area
here
and
i
think
they
probably
were
very
reluctant
to
go
ahead
and
take
definitive
action
with
respect
to
a
particular
person
until
they
had
a
properly
framed
case,
we
now
have
it
and
i
think
another
ramification
could
be
that
we
just
repeal
article
31
(b)
and
pass
what
this
court
has
upheld
many
times
an
habitual
criminal
statute,
automatic
knee-jerk
reaction,
third
conviction
he
gets
the
maximum.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
fourth
conviction
and
he
gets
life.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
true.
he
was
a
young
man.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right,
that
is
right
and
would
not
guarantee
any
treatment
to
the
man.
he
would
be
subjected
upon
multiple
offenses
to
life
imprisonment
without
benefit
of
parole.
that
is
no
answer.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
your
honor,
i
think
it
really
does
not.
in
this
case
the
state
will
be
glad
to
give
him
the
hearing.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no,
if
we
have
a
court
hearing,
if
we
have
a
court
hearing
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
alright,
i
have
said
that
the
state
would
be
delighted
tomorrow
to
provide
a
hearing
to
this
petitioner
if
it
could
be
given
the
tools
to
make
the
evaluation
necessary
under
the
statute.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
true.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
he
is
it.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that's
his
position
and
the
state
simply
cannot
accept
it.
i
did
not
get
a
chance
to
mention
that
there
is
excellent
language
in
lipscomb
case
from
california
and
a
judge
sobeloff's
separate
opinion
in
the
tipitt
case
on
the
very
subject
of
the
state's
right
to
inquire
into
this
man's
mind
or
--
and
finally
i
am
struck
by
a
quote
from
mr.
justice
brandice
in
the
new
state
ice
versus
liebmann
case
in
which
he
said
it
is
one
of
the
happy
incidents
of
the
federal
system
that
a
single
of
courageous
state
can
engage
in
innovative
and
humanitarian
experimentation
in
the
social
and
economic
field.
the
state
of
maryland
is
out
front
here
and
i
think
i
submit
that
many
of
the
reasons
that
were
been
before
this
court
twice
in
the
last
month
is
simply
that
and
i
think
we
are
in
an
area
where
new
ground
is
passed
to
be
broken
for
the
benefit
of
everyone.
thank
you.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes
it
is
your
honor.
it
is
called
people
versus
lipscomb.
