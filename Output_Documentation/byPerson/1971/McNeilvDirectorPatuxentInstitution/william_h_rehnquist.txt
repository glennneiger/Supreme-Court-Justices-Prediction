justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
facts
of
this
case
do
not
require
you
to
rest
on
any
expression
of
a
statutory
period
of
time
less
than
the
period
of
it
is
confinement
under
the
criminal
sentence,
do
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lord,
even
if
you
are
right
that
he
does
not
have
a
fifth
amendment
right
in
his
proceedings
in
the
diagnostic
stage
of
patuxent,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
got
a
much
more
difficult
case
to
argue
here
than
you
argued
in
murel
because
the
petitioners
in
murel
who
were
still
on
the
diagnostic
phase
had
not
served
out
their
sentence.
and
there
was
something
to
be
said
at
least
i
felt
for
the
argument
that
they
were
certainly
no
worse
off
in
the
diagnostic
therapy
at
patuxent
that
they
are
in
some
other
prison,
but
here
your
man
has
served
out
his
term
and
it
seems
to
me
of
quite
a
burden
on
you
to
justify
detaining
him
beyond
there.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
your
statutory
scheme
eventually
contemplates
a
judicial
hearing
on
the
fact
of
defective
delinquency
and
certainly
i
think
it
can
be
argued
that
a
delay
in
that
hearing,
an
adjudication
there
and
so
long
as
the
man
still
under
a
sentence,
maybe
justified
on
a
number
of
grounds,
but
when
you
continue
to
detain
him
after
the
expiration
of
his
sentence
without
any
new
judicial
determination
as
to
why
should
be
determined,
i
think
you
have
got
a
real
problem.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
the
state
have
the
right
to
treat
him
indefinitely
without
any
judicial
determination
that
he
ought
to
be
treated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
counsel
says
that
within
the
time
of
his
sentence
if
you
have
made
a
determination
you
have
a
got
a
fish
or
cut
bait
in
effect,
that
does
not
seem
unreasonable
to
me?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
still
it
isn't
any
guarantee
your
cooperation
from
everyone
who
is
referred
for
diagnosis?
