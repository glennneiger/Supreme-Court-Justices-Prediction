mr.

do
you
make
a

contention
here
that
that

of
louisiana

respecting
legitimation
distinguishing
between
the
case
where
there
was
an
impediment
to
the
marriage
of
the
parents
or
there
wasn’t,
that
that
itself
is
a
violation
of
equal
protection?
or
do
you
concede
that
is
rational
based
statute?
justice

in
other
words,
had
there

in
this

the

that

rehnquist
mr.

have
these
children
born
out
of

been
there
to

and
have
