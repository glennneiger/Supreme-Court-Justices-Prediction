mr.
w.
henson
moore
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel
in
this
case
looked
at
this
particular
case
before
you
is
somewhere
in
a
gray
area
either
between
levy
versus
louisiana,
labine
versus
vincent
and
perhaps
in
a
gray
area
on
the
either
extreme
of
these
two
cases.
it’s
the
opinion
of
the
respondents
that
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination
in
this
case.
i’d
like
to
draw
a
contrast
in
this
case
with
levy
and
labine.
first,
in
the
levy
case
you
had
a
tort
situation.
the
louisiana
law
has
drawn
this
distinction
and
has
not
extended
levy
beyond
tort.
in
the
labine
decision,
this
honorable
court
noted
that
this
is
while
the
distinction;
levy
applied
the
tort.
secondly,
in
the
levy
case
it
was
pointed
out
quite
forcefully
the
wrong
doer
was
about
to
go
scot-free.
no
one
was
going
to
recover.
no
tortfeasor
was
going
to
have
to
pay
for
the
death
of
the
mother
in
the
levy
case,
and
the
case
at
bar
at
this
time
there
is
no
wrong
doer.
this
is
workmen’s
compensation.
there
is
no
question
of
fault.
there
is
no
question
of
someone
getting
all
free.
however,
i
might
point
out
as
mr.
lacour
did.
under
louisiana’s
workmen’s
compensation
law,
the
employer
is
entitled
to
recover
workmen’s
compensation
benefits
he
pays
to
an
employee
from
the
tortfeasor,
if
there
is
a
tortfeasor
who
injured
the
employee.
we
now,
as
respondents,
have
lost
that
right
because
of
one
year
proscription
in
louisiana
law.
this
action
took
place
in
1967
therefore
--
mr.
w.
henson
moore
well,
we
got
that
--
mr.
w.
henson
moore
we
got
that
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
clear
at
all
that
what
should
happen
if
this
honorable
court
should
reverse
this
decision.
it
may
well
be,
we’ve
got
to
turn
right
around
and
pay
the
two
children,
that
mr.
lacour
represents,
their
fair
share,
and
then
try
to
recover
that
back
from
the
tortfeasor,
which
we
can
no
longer
do,
we
are
barred
by
one
year
proscription.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
that’s
correct.
that’s
the
maximum
amount
of
wages
paid
on
louisiana
law.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
workmen’s
compensation.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
i
have
the
complete
set
off
as
to
those
four,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
that’s
right.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
well,
but
what
i’m
trying
to
say
is
your
honor,
it
is
not
clear
under
our
law
at
all
whether
or
not
i
will
still
be
liable
to
mr.
lacour’s
class
for
workmen’s
compensation.
the
set
off
i
got,
applied
to
the
four
people
on
louisiana
law
at
the
time
this
case
was
decided
who
could
recover
compensation.
mr.
lacour’s
class
could
not,
and
so
it
is
not
clear
at
our
law
then,
in
other
words,
if
you
reverse
this
case
and
they
will
be,
but
i
have
now
pay
his
clients
and
the
set
off
by
had
against
the
four
legitimate
children
is
no
protection
to
me
now
as
to
these
two
children
and
therefore
the
tortfeasor
one
year
is
going
by
and
so
this
is
an
interesting
quarrel,
if
this
case
is
reverse
the
tortfeasor
will
get
all
scot-free
as
far
as
the
liability
for
compensation
to
two
more
children.
now,
the
next
point
i
would
like
to
point
out
and
distinction
is
the
fact
of
this
unacknowledged
illegitimate
children
situation.
under
the
tort
law
of
louisiana
part
of
the
levy
whether
you
are
acknowledged
or
unacknowledged
may
draw
a
difference.
if
you’re
illegitimate
you
could
recover
no
tort
benefits,
only
legitimate
children
could,
born
in
wedlock
or
adopted.
this
is
not
true
in
the
compensation
law
of
louisiana.
if
you
are,
in
fact,
an
illegitimate
unacknowledged
you’re
treated
as
an
other
dependent
under
subsection
8
of
our
list
of
ranking
of
dependents
and
how
they
will
recover
the
money.
this
applies
in
this
case,
that
you
are
not
excluded
from
workmen’s
compensation
by
law
that
you
are
right
but
not
excluded.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
called
your
attention
to
this
--
yes,
as
matter
of
ranking
in
preference
under
section
1232
of
our
louisiana
workmen’s
compensation
law,
which
i
quote
verbatim
in
my
brief.
“there
are
eight
classifications
or
ranking
of
which
dependent
in
which
situation
gets
what
percent
of
the
allowable
wages
to
be
paid
in
workmen’s
compensation
benefits."
the
illegitimate
unacknowledged
children
are
treated
as
other
dependents
under
the
eighth
ranking
meaning
in
order
of
preference.
they
are
eighth
in
the
line,
eighth
in
the
line
of
preference.
but
of
those
eight
the
first,
second,
fourth,
fifth
and
seventh
all
have
situations
where
there
may
be
somebody
in
a
high
ranking
that
does
not
use
up
the
whole
65%,
the
balance
then
goes
down
the
line
and
it
would
come
to
the
eighth
rank
illegitimate
unacknowledged
children.
in
other
words,
i
gave
an
example.
under
section
5,
subsection
5
it
says,
if
there
are
two
children
meaning,
legitimates
are
acknowledged.
these
two
children
recovered
fourty-six
and
one-quarter
percent
of
the
wages.
the
difference
between
this
forty-six
and
one-quarter
percent
and
sixty-five
percent
would
go
down
the
line
to
the
next
order
of
persons
all
the
way
to
the
end.
in
that
case
there
would
be
a
--
in
this
case
the
illegitimate
children
would
recover
the
difference
between
forty-six
and
one-quarter
and
sixty-five
percent.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
that’s
right.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
correct,
your
honor.
correct.
and
so
we
are
trying
to
point
out
here
is
that
there
is
no
absolute
barrier
for
illegitimate
unacknowledged
child
to
recover
compensation
as
the
laws
in
the
tort
law
of
louisiana
dealing
with
2315.
now
in
the
case
of
labine
versus
vincent
the
same
thing
is
true.
an
illegitimate
unacknowledged
child
has
absolute
no
right
to
inherit
under
louisiana
law.
this
again,
we
just
pointed
out,
is
not
true
in
our
compensation
law.
now
let's
take
the
situation
of
the
acknowledged
illegitimate
child,
how
is
it
for
you?
mr.
w.
henson
moore
at
the
time
of
the
decedent’s
death,
no,
they
could
not
have
been,
that’s
correct.
of
course
the
law
goes
on
to
point
out
that
should
these
two
persons
subsequently
contract
illegal
marriage,
they
then
can
adopt,
and
so
the
restriction
there
is
not
one
for
all
time.
it
worked
out
that
way
in
this
case,
because
obviously,
the
man
died
before
he
had
the
chance
to
properly
divorce
his
first
wife
and
marry
the
woman
with
whom
he
was
living.
and
the
case
of
the
acknowledged
illegitimate
child,
once
again
under
levy,
he
had
no
right
of
recovery.
as
you
point
out
in
labine
versus
vincent,
he
does
have
a
right
of
succession,
a
right
to
be
in
the
succession,
but
he
has
not
rank
equally
with
legitimate
children.
even
in
labine
versus
vincent,
he
comes
in
a
preferential
order.
he
comes
down
the
line
ahead
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
several
other
miscellaneous
persons
with
on
the
line
on
order
of
succession,
but
he
has
not
acknowledged,
illegitimate
child
is
not
treated
equally
with
the
legitimate
child
of
louisiana
succession
law.
now,
we
come
to
louisiana’s
workmen’s
compensation
law
and
we
see
that
an
acknowledged
illegitimate
child
is
treated
equally
with
the
adopted
or
children
born
to
a
legal
marriage.
therefore
once
again
we
can
see
that
in
looking
to
similarities,
louisiana’s
workmen’s
compensation
law
does
not
have
any
were
near
the
barriers
found
in
levy
and
it
is
indeed
far
better
off
than
those
this
honorable
court
pointed
out
in
labine
versus
vincent.
further,
as
i
pointed
out,
in
the
case
of
whether
a
child
can
be
acknowledge
or
not,
if
those
two
parents
subsequently
marry,
they
can
then
acknowledge
the
child.
i
would
like
also
point
out
the
discrimination
here
as
to
the
illegitimate
children
is
no
different
than
discrimination
of
a
ranking
of
all
persons
in
the
eight
subcategories
of
dependents.
in
other
words
the
ascendants
are
ranked
over
the
collateral
relations
and
the
descendants
are
ranked
over
the
ascendants,
and
so
this
is
just
the
whole
schematic
line
up
of
rankings
here.
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination
any
of
them,
they
use
to
give
a
preferential
order
of
how
the
support
is
to
be
partialled
out.
the
moment
--
the
question
was
asked
a
moment
ago
as
for
the
reason
for
this
ranking
or
why
this
was
done.
and
i’d
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
--
on
page
76
of
the
appendix,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
summed
it
up
as
best
as
we
can
find
anywhere
in
print.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
said
for
ourselves
we
find
nothing
invidious
into
the
distinction
made
in
the
compensation
statute,
which
would
protect
such
legally
recognize
family
relationships
anymore
in
the
preference
given
the
legitimate
dependent
children
even
the
illegitimate
ones
when
they’re
duly
acknowledged
over
dependent
parents.
what
the
court
is
saying
here
is,
this
is
all
louisiana,
legislative
of
louisiana
has
felt
that
this
protects
the
order,
the
existing
family
orders,
but
partialling
out
the
compensation
based
upon
first
of
all
the
question
of
dependency
and
secondly
the
question
of
the
family
relationship.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
honorable
court
in
the
levy
decision
noted
the
fairness
of
louisiana’s
workmen’s
compensation
law
in
footnote
number
7,
and
so
i'd
like
to
point
again,
to
the
fact
that
louisiana
workmen’s
compensation
law
does
not
have
absolute
invidious
discrimination
or
an
absolute
barrier
to
recovery.
it
is
just
in
this
particular
case
it
appears
that
this
time
at
this
time
the
two
illegitimate
children
will
not
recover
anything.
now
if
subsequently,
before
the
400
weeks
expires,
i
assume
that
this
time
it
has
expired,
if
one
or
more
of
the
illegitimate
children
had
died
then
there
would
be
this
balance
or
overflow
that
would
go
down
the
line
to
the
illegitimates,
and
so
even
after
the
court
rendered
its
initial
opinion
to
this
case,
it
was
still
possible
for
the
illegitimates
to
come
and
to
some
workman’s
compensation
benefits.
this
was
noted
and
preserved
in
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
correct,
sir.
correct
under
compensation
law.
that’s
not
true
or
it’s
not
true
under
the
tort
law
and
it
is
not
true
still
under
succession
law
to
labine
versus
vincent,
but
it
true
in
the
workmen’s
compensation
law.
your
honors,
i’d
like
to
point
out
the
language
in
labine
and
levy,
which
lead
to
louisiana’s
discretion
or
its
power
to
do
what
is
done
in
setting
up
this
louisiana
workmen’s
compensation
law.
in
labine,
this
honorable
court
pointed
out
and
i
quote,
“levy
did
not
say
and
cannot
barely
be
read
to
say
that
a
state
can
never
treat
any
illegitimate
child
differently
from
legitimate
offspring.”
and
further
the
court
noted
that
and
i
quote,
“the
choices
reflected
by
the
interstate
or
the
intrastate
succession
statutes
are
choices
which
is
within
its
power
of
the
state
to
make.”
the
federal
constitution
does
not
give
this
court
the
power
to
overturn
the
state’s
choice
under
the
guidance
of
constitutional
interpretation,
because
the
justice
of
this
court
can
provide
better
rules.
and
under
levy
the
majority
opinion
and
i
quote,
“in
applying
the
equal
protection
clause
to
social
and
economic
legislation,
we
give
great
latitude
of
the
legislature
in
making
classifications.”
i
would
like
to
say
of
course
louisiana’s
workmen’s
compensation
law
has
been
definitely
social
and
economic
legislature,
and
we
ask
this
honorable
court
to
find
that
the
state
of
louisiana
has
had
its
latitude
in
making
this
classifications
that
they
are
not
invidious
and
that
the
state
can,
in
this
case,
treat
illegitimate
children
somewhat
differently
in
a
ranking
if
it
has
not
absolutely
prevented
them
from
recovery.
and
we
ask
you
therefore
to
find
that
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination
and
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
louisiana
supreme
court.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
no,
sir.
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
injury,
the
benefits
are
paid
directly
to
the
injured
employee.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
that’s
correct.
we
have
partial
disability
and
permanent
disability
situations.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
in
that
case
your
honor
i
am
not
sure
i
think
he
would
probably
be
paid
to
--
mr.
w.
henson
moore
you
have
to
have
someone
appointed
as
a
treater,
not
a
treater
but
administrator
of
his
state
and
money
would
be
paid
to
that
person.
but
that’s
the
only
in
the
case
of
a
death
situation
you
are
under
classification
of
who
are
the
beneficiaries
of
the
compensation
benefits.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel
in
this
case
looked
at
this
particular
case
before
you
is
somewhere
in
a
gray
area
either
between
levy
versus
louisiana,
labine
versus
vincent
and
perhaps
in
a
gray
area
on
the
either
extreme
of
these
two
cases.
it’s
the
opinion
of
the
respondents
that
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination
in
this
case.
i’d
like
to
draw
a
contrast
in
this
case
with
levy
and
labine.
first,
in
the
levy
case
you
had
a
tort
situation.
the
louisiana
law
has
drawn
this
distinction
and
has
not
extended
levy
beyond
tort.
in
the
labine
decision,
this
honorable
court
noted
that
this
is
while
the
distinction;
levy
applied
the
tort.
secondly,
in
the
levy
case
it
was
pointed
out
quite
forcefully
the
wrong
doer
was
about
to
go
scot-free.
no
one
was
going
to
recover.
no
tortfeasor
was
going
to
have
to
pay
for
the
death
of
the
mother
in
the
levy
case,
and
the
case
at
bar
at
this
time
there
is
no
wrong
doer.
this
is
workmen’s
compensation.
there
is
no
question
of
fault.
there
is
no
question
of
someone
getting
all
free.
however,
i
might
point
out
as
mr.
lacour
did.
under
louisiana’s
workmen’s
compensation
law,
the
employer
is
entitled
to
recover
workmen’s
compensation
benefits
he
pays
to
an
employee
from
the
tortfeasor,
if
there
is
a
tortfeasor
who
injured
the
employee.
we
now,
as
respondents,
have
lost
that
right
because
of
one
year
proscription
in
louisiana
law.
this
action
took
place
in
1967
therefore
--
mr.
w.
henson
moore
well,
we
got
that
--
mr.
w.
henson
moore
we
got
that
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
clear
at
all
that
what
should
happen
if
this
honorable
court
should
reverse
this
decision.
it
may
well
be,
we’ve
got
to
turn
right
around
and
pay
the
two
children,
that
mr.
lacour
represents,
their
fair
share,
and
then
try
to
recover
that
back
from
the
tortfeasor,
which
we
can
no
longer
do,
we
are
barred
by
one
year
proscription.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
that’s
correct.
that’s
the
maximum
amount
of
wages
paid
on
louisiana
law.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
workmen’s
compensation.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
i
have
the
complete
set
off
as
to
those
four,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
that’s
right.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
well,
but
what
i’m
trying
to
say
is
your
honor,
it
is
not
clear
under
our
law
at
all
whether
or
not
i
will
still
be
liable
to
mr.
lacour’s
class
for
workmen’s
compensation.
the
set
off
i
got,
applied
to
the
four
people
on
louisiana
law
at
the
time
this
case
was
decided
who
could
recover
compensation.
mr.
lacour’s
class
could
not,
and
so
it
is
not
clear
at
our
law
then,
in
other
words,
if
you
reverse
this
case
and
they
will
be,
but
i
have
now
pay
his
clients
and
the
set
off
by
had
against
the
four
legitimate
children
is
no
protection
to
me
now
as
to
these
two
children
and
therefore
the
tortfeasor
one
year
is
going
by
and
so
this
is
an
interesting
quarrel,
if
this
case
is
reverse
the
tortfeasor
will
get
all
scot-free
as
far
as
the
liability
for
compensation
to
two
more
children.
now,
the
next
point
i
would
like
to
point
out
and
distinction
is
the
fact
of
this
unacknowledged
illegitimate
children
situation.
under
the
tort
law
of
louisiana
part
of
the
levy
whether
you
are
acknowledged
or
unacknowledged
may
draw
a
difference.
if
you’re
illegitimate
you
could
recover
no
tort
benefits,
only
legitimate
children
could,
born
in
wedlock
or
adopted.
this
is
not
true
in
the
compensation
law
of
louisiana.
if
you
are,
in
fact,
an
illegitimate
unacknowledged
you’re
treated
as
an
other
dependent
under
subsection
8
of
our
list
of
ranking
of
dependents
and
how
they
will
recover
the
money.
this
applies
in
this
case,
that
you
are
not
excluded
from
workmen’s
compensation
by
law
that
you
are
right
but
not
excluded.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
called
your
attention
to
this
--
yes,
as
matter
of
ranking
in
preference
under
section
1232
of
our
louisiana
workmen’s
compensation
law,
which
i
quote
verbatim
in
my
brief.
“there
are
eight
classifications
or
ranking
of
which
dependent
in
which
situation
gets
what
percent
of
the
allowable
wages
to
be
paid
in
workmen’s
compensation
benefits."
the
illegitimate
unacknowledged
children
are
treated
as
other
dependents
under
the
eighth
ranking
meaning
in
order
of
preference.
they
are
eighth
in
the
line,
eighth
in
the
line
of
preference.
but
of
those
eight
the
first,
second,
fourth,
fifth
and
seventh
all
have
situations
where
there
may
be
somebody
in
a
high
ranking
that
does
not
use
up
the
whole
65%,
the
balance
then
goes
down
the
line
and
it
would
come
to
the
eighth
rank
illegitimate
unacknowledged
children.
in
other
words,
i
gave
an
example.
under
section
5,
subsection
5
it
says,
if
there
are
two
children
meaning,
legitimates
are
acknowledged.
these
two
children
recovered
fourty-six
and
one-quarter
percent
of
the
wages.
the
difference
between
this
forty-six
and
one-quarter
percent
and
sixty-five
percent
would
go
down
the
line
to
the
next
order
of
persons
all
the
way
to
the
end.
in
that
case
there
would
be
a
--
in
this
case
the
illegitimate
children
would
recover
the
difference
between
forty-six
and
one-quarter
and
sixty-five
percent.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
that’s
right.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
correct,
your
honor.
correct.
and
so
we
are
trying
to
point
out
here
is
that
there
is
no
absolute
barrier
for
illegitimate
unacknowledged
child
to
recover
compensation
as
the
laws
in
the
tort
law
of
louisiana
dealing
with
2315.
now
in
the
case
of
labine
versus
vincent
the
same
thing
is
true.
an
illegitimate
unacknowledged
child
has
absolute
no
right
to
inherit
under
louisiana
law.
this
again,
we
just
pointed
out,
is
not
true
in
our
compensation
law.
now
let's
take
the
situation
of
the
acknowledged
illegitimate
child,
how
is
it
for
you?
mr.
w.
henson
moore
at
the
time
of
the
decedent’s
death,
no,
they
could
not
have
been,
that’s
correct.
of
course
the
law
goes
on
to
point
out
that
should
these
two
persons
subsequently
contract
illegal
marriage,
they
then
can
adopt,
and
so
the
restriction
there
is
not
one
for
all
time.
it
worked
out
that
way
in
this
case,
because
obviously,
the
man
died
before
he
had
the
chance
to
properly
divorce
his
first
wife
and
marry
the
woman
with
whom
he
was
living.
and
the
case
of
the
acknowledged
illegitimate
child,
once
again
under
levy,
he
had
no
right
of
recovery.
as
you
point
out
in
labine
versus
vincent,
he
does
have
a
right
of
succession,
a
right
to
be
in
the
succession,
but
he
has
not
rank
equally
with
legitimate
children.
even
in
labine
versus
vincent,
he
comes
in
a
preferential
order.
he
comes
down
the
line
ahead
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
several
other
miscellaneous
persons
with
on
the
line
on
order
of
succession,
but
he
has
not
acknowledged,
illegitimate
child
is
not
treated
equally
with
the
legitimate
child
of
louisiana
succession
law.
now,
we
come
to
louisiana’s
workmen’s
compensation
law
and
we
see
that
an
acknowledged
illegitimate
child
is
treated
equally
with
the
adopted
or
children
born
to
a
legal
marriage.
therefore
once
again
we
can
see
that
in
looking
to
similarities,
louisiana’s
workmen’s
compensation
law
does
not
have
any
were
near
the
barriers
found
in
levy
and
it
is
indeed
far
better
off
than
those
this
honorable
court
pointed
out
in
labine
versus
vincent.
further,
as
i
pointed
out,
in
the
case
of
whether
a
child
can
be
acknowledge
or
not,
if
those
two
parents
subsequently
marry,
they
can
then
acknowledge
the
child.
i
would
like
also
point
out
the
discrimination
here
as
to
the
illegitimate
children
is
no
different
than
discrimination
of
a
ranking
of
all
persons
in
the
eight
subcategories
of
dependents.
in
other
words
the
ascendants
are
ranked
over
the
collateral
relations
and
the
descendants
are
ranked
over
the
ascendants,
and
so
this
is
just
the
whole
schematic
line
up
of
rankings
here.
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination
any
of
them,
they
use
to
give
a
preferential
order
of
how
the
support
is
to
be
partialled
out.
the
moment
--
the
question
was
asked
a
moment
ago
as
for
the
reason
for
this
ranking
or
why
this
was
done.
and
i’d
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
--
on
page
76
of
the
appendix,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
summed
it
up
as
best
as
we
can
find
anywhere
in
print.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
said
for
ourselves
we
find
nothing
invidious
into
the
distinction
made
in
the
compensation
statute,
which
would
protect
such
legally
recognize
family
relationships
anymore
in
the
preference
given
the
legitimate
dependent
children
even
the
illegitimate
ones
when
they’re
duly
acknowledged
over
dependent
parents.
what
the
court
is
saying
here
is,
this
is
all
louisiana,
legislative
of
louisiana
has
felt
that
this
protects
the
order,
the
existing
family
orders,
but
partialling
out
the
compensation
based
upon
first
of
all
the
question
of
dependency
and
secondly
the
question
of
the
family
relationship.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
honorable
court
in
the
levy
decision
noted
the
fairness
of
louisiana’s
workmen’s
compensation
law
in
footnote
number
7,
and
so
i'd
like
to
point
again,
to
the
fact
that
louisiana
workmen’s
compensation
law
does
not
have
absolute
invidious
discrimination
or
an
absolute
barrier
to
recovery.
it
is
just
in
this
particular
case
it
appears
that
this
time
at
this
time
the
two
illegitimate
children
will
not
recover
anything.
now
if
subsequently,
before
the
400
weeks
expires,
i
assume
that
this
time
it
has
expired,
if
one
or
more
of
the
illegitimate
children
had
died
then
there
would
be
this
balance
or
overflow
that
would
go
down
the
line
to
the
illegitimates,
and
so
even
after
the
court
rendered
its
initial
opinion
to
this
case,
it
was
still
possible
for
the
illegitimates
to
come
and
to
some
workman’s
compensation
benefits.
this
was
noted
and
preserved
in
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
correct,
sir.
correct
under
compensation
law.
that’s
not
true
or
it’s
not
true
under
the
tort
law
and
it
is
not
true
still
under
succession
law
to
labine
versus
vincent,
but
it
true
in
the
workmen’s
compensation
law.
your
honors,
i’d
like
to
point
out
the
language
in
labine
and
levy,
which
lead
to
louisiana’s
discretion
or
its
power
to
do
what
is
done
in
setting
up
this
louisiana
workmen’s
compensation
law.
in
labine,
this
honorable
court
pointed
out
and
i
quote,
“levy
did
not
say
and
cannot
barely
be
read
to
say
that
a
state
can
never
treat
any
illegitimate
child
differently
from
legitimate
offspring.”
and
further
the
court
noted
that
and
i
quote,
“the
choices
reflected
by
the
interstate
or
the
intrastate
succession
statutes
are
choices
which
is
within
its
power
of
the
state
to
make.”
the
federal
constitution
does
not
give
this
court
the
power
to
overturn
the
state’s
choice
under
the
guidance
of
constitutional
interpretation,
because
the
justice
of
this
court
can
provide
better
rules.
and
under
levy
the
majority
opinion
and
i
quote,
“in
applying
the
equal
protection
clause
to
social
and
economic
legislation,
we
give
great
latitude
of
the
legislature
in
making
classifications.”
i
would
like
to
say
of
course
louisiana’s
workmen’s
compensation
law
has
been
definitely
social
and
economic
legislature,
and
we
ask
this
honorable
court
to
find
that
the
state
of
louisiana
has
had
its
latitude
in
making
this
classifications
that
they
are
not
invidious
and
that
the
state
can,
in
this
case,
treat
illegitimate
children
somewhat
differently
in
a
ranking
if
it
has
not
absolutely
prevented
them
from
recovery.
and
we
ask
you
therefore
to
find
that
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination
and
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
louisiana
supreme
court.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
no,
sir.
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
injury,
the
benefits
are
paid
directly
to
the
injured
employee.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
that’s
correct.
we
have
partial
disability
and
permanent
disability
situations.
mr.
w.
henson
moore
in
that
case
your
honor
i
am
not
sure
i
think
he
would
probably
be
paid
to
--
mr.
w.
henson
moore
you
have
to
have
someone
appointed
as
a
treater,
not
a
treater
but
administrator
of
his
state
and
money
would
be
paid
to
that
person.
but
that’s
the
only
in
the
case
of
a
death
situation
you
are
under
classification
of
who
are
the
beneficiaries
of
the
compensation
benefits.
