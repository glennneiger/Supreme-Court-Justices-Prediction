mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
sole
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
denial
of
workmen’s
compensation
to
dependent
illegitimate
children
of
a
single
family
unit,
solely
because
they
are
really
illegitimate
deprives
such
illegitimate
children
of
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i’ll
sketch
the
facts
of
the
case
briefly.
henry
clyde
stokes
was
the
father
of
four
legitimate
children
born
of
the
marriage
with
a
lawfully
wedded
wife
from
whom
he
was
separated.
he
became
the
paramour
or
common-law
husband
of
willie
mae
weber.
he
moved
his
four
illegitimate
children
into
the
house
with
her
and
lived
there
as
a
family
unit.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
that
don’t
mean
--
i
mean
out
of
wedlock
wife
if
i
may
put
it
that
way.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
there
are
no
common-law
marriages
in
louisiana.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
his
lawful
wife
was
still
living
but
they
were
separated
not
judicially
separated
or
divorced.
while
living
with
willie
mae
weber,
they
were
born
one
child
of
their
illicit
or
out
of
wedlock
relationship.
then
while
they
were
living,
he
was
employed
as
a
truck
driver.
he
was
killed
on
the
job
and
of
course,
the
scope
of
his
employment
had
no
dispute
was
that
he
was
covered
by
workmen’s
compensation
under
louisiana
law.
and
sometime
after
his
death,
there
was
born
to
willie
mae
weber
another
child
conceived
out
of
the
relationship
with
him
prior
to
his
death.
now
--
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
yes,
he
would
have.
but
if
he
is
a
posthumous
child
and
an
illegitimate
child,
louisiana
does,
even
though
it
isn’t
involve
in
this
case,
louisiana
does
draw
a
distinct
between
a
posthumous
illegitimate
and
a
posthumous
legitimate.
a
posthumous
legitimate
child
will
be
paid
workmen’s
compensation
but
not
a
posthumous
illegitimate,
which
is
another
discrimination
not
emphasized
in
the
case
however,
because
there
are
larger
discriminations
here
which
we
could
not
even
get
to
this.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
that
is
argued,
i
suppose
so;
however,
without
being
suspicious,
i
suppose
the
proof
of
paternity
you
assume
it.
you
prove
it
by
outward
manifestation
of
family
membership.
in
this
instance,
the
posthumous
child
that
the
mother
conceived
the
child,
she
was
pregnant
had
no
doubt
in
the
record,
it’s
not
in
dispute
that
henry
clyde
stoke,
the
deceased
employee
was
the
father
of
the
child.
now
--
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
not
of
paternity,
of
maternity,
even
though
louisiana
law
requires
--
well,
it’s
earn
settle
in
louisiana
as
to
whether
or
not
what
we
call
an
informal
acknowledgement
of
an
illegitimate
child,
lifts
that
child
from
the
object
of
lowest
level
of
which
the
civil
code
say
it
is
known
by
the
escalation
basket,
whereas
the
child
acknowledged
either
formally
by
notarial
act
or
some
formal
act
or
informally
the
mother,
because
of
maternity
doesn’t
leave
open
the
question
of
uncertainty
as
to
parentage.
informal
acknowledgement
of
maternity
is
accepted
on
whereas
there
is
some
reservation
with
respect
to
informal
acknowledgement
of
paternity.
now
--
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
204
of
the
louisiana
civil
code.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
that
is
correct;
that
is
correct.
the
provision
for
acknowledgement,
for
formal
acknowledgement,
has
a
restriction.
the
restriction
is
that
a
parent
may
not
acknowledge
a
child,
either
informally
or
formally,
and
we
are
dealing
with
formally
here
if
at
the
time
of
conception,
there
was
an
impediment
to
the
marriage
of
the
parents
of
the
illegitimate
child.
in
this
instance,
sir,
there
would
have
been
a
bigger
but
myriad
mode
of
conception,
and
the
impediment
was
that
henry
clyde
still
was
lawfully
married
to
another
woman
and
therefore,
these
children
could
not
have
been
acknowledged.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
that
would
be
if
we
are
going
to
focus
our
attention
upon
what
is
argued
as
being
the
distinction
between
labine
and
levy
wherein
labine
apparently
is
saying
that
there
was
insurmountable
barrier
in
levy,
whereas
there
is
not
an
insurmountable
barrier
here
and
that
the
children
could
be
acknowledged.
of
course,
you
will
see
that
there
is
an
insurmountable
barrier
here
when
you
look
at
what
is
said
in
the
amicus
brief
and
what
the
louisiana
civil
code
actually
provides
under
204,
the
insurmountable
barrier
here
because
each
children
couldn’t
even
be
acknowledged.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
no.
as
i
recall
it,
it’s
a
carry
on
through
long
history
from
the
civil
law
or
sort
of
--
i
guess,
for
me
to
discourage,
which
was
rejected
in
levy
to
discourage
the
illicit
relationship
we
would
produce
or
also
to
prohibit
the
bringing
into
up
to
the
statehood
of
a
child,
a
child
where
the
parents
where
actually
married
to
each
other.
it’s
also
the
law
where
it’s
constitution
on
that
an
incestuous
marriage
would
prohibit
or
prevent
the
acknowledgement
of
the
child.
also,
to
the
extent
that
at
the
time
when
it
was
constitutional,
a
misogynous
(ph)
marriage
or
misogynous
relationship,
misogyny,
they
would
have
a
difference
in
rate.
it
would
have
been
an
impediment
to
the
marriage
consequently.
we
have
a
long
line
of
cases
where
a
lot
of
children
couldn’t
be
acknowledged.
now,
back
to
the
--
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
i
concede
that
that
is
a
rational
basis.
what
we
are
saying
here,
we
take
the
position
at
the
trust
of
labine
versus
vincent
is
not
to
reject
or
overrule
levy;
that
levy,
which
held
that
on
article
2315,
which
is
the
louisiana
basic
tort
law.
all
of
other
law
for
negligence
or
other
tort
claim
arise
or
get
its
source
from
article
2315
of
louisiana
civil
code,
which
provides
that
roughly
whoever
is
injured
as
result
of
the
act
of
another
is
entitled
to
reparation.
and
then
louisiana,
through
the
years
enacted
wrong
had
a
wrongful-death
statute
to
give
an
action
for
tort
for
death
to
survivors.
and
as
the
court
knows
in
levy,
the
plaintiffs
were
illegitimate
children
of
the
mother
who
died
as
result
of
an
alleged
tort.
and
the
denial
of
a
tort
cause
of
action
to
those
children
would
have
to
be
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
what
we
are
saying
here
if
levy
is
still
the
law,
then
labine,
it
seems
to
me,
took
pain
to
say
that
levy
is
still
the
law.
and
what
labine
is
saying
is
that
the
denial
of
inheritance
right
is
not
the
same
kind
of
denial
and
deprivation
that
in
a
tort
cause
of
action,
the
child,
as
justice
douglas
points
out,
is
nurtured
by
the
parent,
is
not
a
non-person.
the
child
is
loved
and
he
loses
the
same
thing
when
he
loses
his
parents,
his
mother,
in
that
instance,
the
legitimate
child.
now,
under
louisiana
law
it
really
wasn’t
compensation
law
although
all
the
other
state,
the
workmen’s
compensation
law
is
the
replacement
for
the
tort
law.
now,
so
2315
could
not
be
used
against
the
employer
here.
now
i
need
to
go
into
just
a
little
more
explanation
of
the
fact,
because
there
is
a
tie-in
between
with
workmen’s
compensation
and
the
louisiana
tort
law.
what
happened
further
in
this
case
was
that
the
grandmother
of
the
four
legitimate
children
sought
a
tort
action
against
a
third
party
tortfeasor
who
was
responsible
for
the
acts
of
death
in
which
the
employee
was
killed.
do
you
still
have
your
cause
of
action
against
your
third
party
for
tort
even
though
you
do
have
your
worker’s
compensation?
but
whatever
workmen’s
compensation
you
recover
from
your
third
party
tortfeasor,
you
owe
it,
the
beneficiary
will
owe
it
to
the
employer,
i.e.
to
insure
under
the
right
of
subrogation.
so
the
tort
suit
was
settled,
the
maximum
compensation
payable
in
louisiana
in
any
answers
at
that
time
was
$14,000.00.
the
tort
claim
exceeded
$14,000.00.
the
four
legitimate
children
then
came
back
into
the
state
court
and
dismissed
their
claim
for
workmen’s
compensation
on
the
basis
that
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
recover
anyway,
because
if
they
recovered,
the
right
would
belong
to
aetna
casualty
and
the
truck
driving
concerned
the
employer.
then
the
employer
and
its
insurer
moved
to
dismiss
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
--
the
workmen’s
compensation
had
been
exhausted,
and
we
had,
of
course,
pleaded
that
the
denial
of
workmen’s
compensation
to
the
two
illegitimate
children
would
constitute
the
denial
of
equal
protection
and
the
court
--
the
trial
court
held
that
they
were
entitled
to
workmen’s
compensation
but
only
if
there
was
any
left
after
the
four
legitimate
children
had
used
it
all
up.
so
from
that
we
appeal
on
that
and
what
happens
then
is
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
interpreting
the
workmen’s
compensation
law
of
louisiana
is
saying
that
you
have
six
children
born
of
a
man
who
are
his
dependents.
they
are
supported
by
him.
they
are
all
--
they
are
member
that
acted
the
family
unit
which
he
is
maintaining
at
the
time
of
his
life
and
at
the
time
of
his
death
as
a
family
unit
consisting
of
six
children.
the
out
of
wedlock
wife
or
the
mother
of
the
two
illegitimate
is
also
the
stepmother
of
the
legitimate.
so
everything
is
equal
insofar
as
the
nexus
or
the
relationship
between
the
father
and
the
six
children.
the
only
difference
between
the
four
who
got
the
workmen’s
compensation
and
the
two
who
did
not
is
that
the
four
was
legitimate
and
the
other
two
were
illegitimate.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
no,
if
acknowledged;
if
they
were
acknowledged,
acknowledged
illegitimate
children
would
be
beneficiary
under
the
louisiana
workmen’s
compensation
law.
formerly
acknowledged
illegitimate,
if
those
children
have
been
acknowledged
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
workmen’s
compensation.
if
i
understand
mr.
chief
justice
question
correctly.
i
think
i
have
just
about
covered
the
essential
feature
of
the
case
except,
i
have
to
reemphasize
that
we
believe
what
we
are
arguing
here
is
exactly
what
labine,
that
is
the
louisiana
case
involving
inheritance,
the
reservation
of
labine.
we
believe
also
that
if
the
answer
insurmountable
barrier
is
the
distinction,
if
i
am
clear
in
pointing
out
what
had
happened
in
this
case,
there
is
no
opportunity
for
the
two
illegitimate
children
to
get
any
workmen’s
compensation
here
unless
by
sheer
accident,
because
if
i
may
point
out,
the
$14,000.00
maximum
workmen’s
compensation
was
never
paid
by
the
compensation
carrier;
it
was
paid
by
the
third
party
tortfeasor.
the
compensation,
the
employer
and
the
insurer
got
credit
for
it
because
automatically
they
would
get
credit
for
under
louisiana
workmen’s
compensation
law.
ordinarily,
workmen’s
compensation
benefits
are
paid
weekly.
it
would
have
been
$35.00
a
week
here
for
400
weeks.
here
it
was
not
done
that
way,
there
is
no
money
coming
in
so
that
if
one
of
the
legitimate
should
die
short
of
reaching
adulthood,
one
of
the
illegitimate
would
step
in,
that’s
what
it
meant
under
louisiana
law.
it
is
not
exhausted.
here,
it’s
all
gone
and
so
the
court
just
effectively
closed
the
door
against
the
two
illegitimates
and
saying
your
six
children
living
at
one
family
unit
all
equally
supported
by
the
father,
no
apparent
difference
in
his
treatment
in
what
he
would
have
wished
for
them
to
have,
but
because
the
two
are
illegitimate,
the
four
gets
all
of
the
workmen’s
compensation
and
the
other
two
are
left
upon
(inaudible).
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
yes,
it
would
have
been;
it
would
have
been.
if
204
--
if
there
had
not
been
an
impediment,
he
could
have
acknowledged
them,
and
if
he
had
acknowledged
them
under
louisiana
workmen’s
compensation
law,
they
would
have
been
entitled
to.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
it
wouldn’t
have
been
any
different.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
if
he
could
have
but
didn’t
then
they
would
have
been
excluded
from
workmen’s
compensation.
in
extent,
i
think
perhaps
we
need
to
clear
this
point.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
yes.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
right.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
we
would
still
be
arguing
this
mr.
justice.
we
would
still
be
arguing
that
you
are
excluding
them
because
they
are
illegitimate,
and
if
they
are,
in
every
way,
equally
dependent
upon
the
father
and
it
is
established
and
undisputed
in
the
record
that
they
are
his
children.
then
the
exclusion
of
them
from
participation
in
workmen’s
compensation
along
with
the
other
children
who
had
no
more
dependency
upon
the
father
than
they
had
would
still
be
an
invidious,
arbitrary
and
capricious
without
any
basis
at
all
other
than
they
are
illegitimate
and
the
other
four
are
legitimate.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
well,
you
would
say
then
that
that
would
probably
be
the
argument
under
labine
versus
vincent
that
that
he
had
a
way.
but
i
am
not
willing
in
my
argument
here
that
i
think
is
more
eye
catching
than
the
real
distinction
of
labine.
i
don’t
think
that
insurmountable
barrier
which
was
pointed
out
by
the
court
there
is
it
really
the
real
reason
as
you
read
underneath
here
that
inheritance
is
--
if
they
are
not
involve
the
same
kind
of
nexus
and
attachment
in
human
relation
between
people
that
parent
and
children
do
and
that
when
you
deny
talk
cause
of
action
to
a
child
whose
parent’s
life
has
been
snuffed
out,
you
are
denying
reparation
for
a
deprivation.
but
when
you
deny
the
law
of
succession
and
the
state
say
you
go
this
way
or
that
way,
the
state
is
not
pinpointing
and
saying
you
lost
something
but
you
can’t
get
any
reparation,
because
you’re
illegitimate.
the
state
is
just
saying,
you
don’t
fall
in
that
class
under
who
ruled
you
would
get
a
right
of
inheritance,
and
i
think
the
real
distinction
between
labine
and
vincent
is
not
the
insurmountable
barrier
but
the
real
invidiousness
of
telling
one
who
has
lost
his
parent,
you
cannot
get
a
reparation
that
one
is
entitled
to
from
lost
of
the
parent
merely
because
you
are
illegitimate.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
thank
you.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
just
three
comment,
may
it
please
the
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
an
argument
is
made
here
that
the
employer
and
its
compensation
insurer
would
perhaps
be
prejudice
by
a
non
payable
decision
in
that
now
proscription
has
run,
they
would
not
and
it
would
be
without
their
remedy
of
subrogation.
but
the
record
will
show
however
that
the
circumstances
in
which
the
employer
or
any
its
insurer
find
itself
now
really
was
part
of
its
own
doing,
the
court
should
--
i
want
the
court
to
know
that
the
illegitimate
children
were
brought
into
the
suit
by
what
do
we
call
(inaudible)
in
louisiana
by
interpleader
by
the
compensation
carrier
in
order
to
assure
itself
that
it
would
get
everybody
in
the
court
and
have
finally
decide
so
it
wouldn’t
be
left
or
paying
multiple
payments
or
just
to
avoid
what
normally
interpleader
avoid.
however,
at
this
turn
of
the
event,
when
it
found
itself
entitled
to
the
all
set
and
the
legitimate
children
dismissed
it
too,
it
had
its
fair
opportunity
to
uphold
the
dismissal
and
have
the
things
finally
litigated.
so,
any
prejudice
really
that
itself
is
not
called
by
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
appellants
you
know
would
it
result
to
any
in
affirmance
by
the
court
but
really
be
the
result
of
that
choice
made
in
the
court
below.
now
the
allusion
it
made
also
to
what
the
court
said
in
levy
that
of
defendants
of
louisiana
of
course
in
my
brief
i
footnote
that
point
and
when
i
first
read
it,
when
levy
was
quite
decided,
it
was
mindful
of
the
fact
that
it
did
not
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
the
fairness
or
the
permission
of
the
allowance
of
workmen’s
compensation
to
illegitimate
children,
such
as
the
court
saw
there,
was
not
because
they
were
children,
and
i
want
the
court
--
i
want
to
get
it
clearly
understood
and
try
to
get
it
across
that
the
illegitimate
children
when
they
come
in
under
classification
eight
to
witness
that
more
alludes,
come
in
as
other
dependents
and
anybody
else
who
might
be
a
member
of
a
family
they’re
not
because
they
are
the
children
but
have
been
an
aunt,
or
had
been
a
maid,
or
had
been
an
uncle
living
in
the
family
and
he
could
show
that
dependency
of
that
family
and
there
were
not
enough
legitimate
children
to
use
up
the
workmen’s
compensation
he
would
come
in
so
this
little
children
are
thrown
with
this
crowd
that
happen
to
be
dependent
and
they’re
not
respected
as
dependent
member
or
children
who
have
that
nexus
that
we’re
talking
about
that
the
court
was
talking
about
in
levy
and
that
is
really
the
workmen’s
compensation
replace
it
2315
here
and
if
to
disregard
the
children
as
it
did
on
the
workmen
on
the
2315
on
the
tort
it
is
invidious
discrimination.
you’re
taking
away
from
them
here
the
very
same
thing
in
the
ninth
and
the
very
same
thing
under
guide
of
workmen’s
compensation
that
would
been
denied
on
the
levy
so
with
that
--
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
yes.
yes,
if
he
has
approved
dependency
and
provide
it
--
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
and
provided
the
nature
that
would
have
taken
even
though
they
were
unacknowledged,
incapable
of
being
acknowledged
illegitimate
would
have
taken
whatever
promise
that
have
been
left
if
they
had
not
been
a
enough
people
to
use
up
all
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
yes,
not
only
proving
the
fact
of
being
fair
and
having
the
nexus
to
apply
the
need
the
same
reparation
for
the
loss
of
a
parent
that
has
illegitimate
children.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
right.
not
in
the
both
bases,
but
indeed
particular
facts
on
this
petition
case
was
one
family
unit
and
there
is
nothing
nor
the
reason
to
mistreat
these
two
children
here
as
they
were
mistreated
and
that
they
were
illegitimate.
yes
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
invidious
in
any
case
as
now
as
this.
if
--
i
don’t
see
how
we
can
escape
seeing
invidiousness
of
treating
those
children,
and
we
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
ought
to
be
reversed
and
the
case
be
remanded
for
the
appropriate
relief.
thank
you.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
sole
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
denial
of
workmen’s
compensation
to
dependent
illegitimate
children
of
a
single
family
unit,
solely
because
they
are
really
illegitimate
deprives
such
illegitimate
children
of
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i’ll
sketch
the
facts
of
the
case
briefly.
henry
clyde
stokes
was
the
father
of
four
legitimate
children
born
of
the
marriage
with
a
lawfully
wedded
wife
from
whom
he
was
separated.
he
became
the
paramour
or
common-law
husband
of
willie
mae
weber.
he
moved
his
four
illegitimate
children
into
the
house
with
her
and
lived
there
as
a
family
unit.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
that
don’t
mean
--
i
mean
out
of
wedlock
wife
if
i
may
put
it
that
way.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
there
are
no
common-law
marriages
in
louisiana.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
his
lawful
wife
was
still
living
but
they
were
separated
not
judicially
separated
or
divorced.
while
living
with
willie
mae
weber,
they
were
born
one
child
of
their
illicit
or
out
of
wedlock
relationship.
then
while
they
were
living,
he
was
employed
as
a
truck
driver.
he
was
killed
on
the
job
and
of
course,
the
scope
of
his
employment
had
no
dispute
was
that
he
was
covered
by
workmen’s
compensation
under
louisiana
law.
and
sometime
after
his
death,
there
was
born
to
willie
mae
weber
another
child
conceived
out
of
the
relationship
with
him
prior
to
his
death.
now
--
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
yes,
he
would
have.
but
if
he
is
a
posthumous
child
and
an
illegitimate
child,
louisiana
does,
even
though
it
isn’t
involve
in
this
case,
louisiana
does
draw
a
distinct
between
a
posthumous
illegitimate
and
a
posthumous
legitimate.
a
posthumous
legitimate
child
will
be
paid
workmen’s
compensation
but
not
a
posthumous
illegitimate,
which
is
another
discrimination
not
emphasized
in
the
case
however,
because
there
are
larger
discriminations
here
which
we
could
not
even
get
to
this.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
that
is
argued,
i
suppose
so;
however,
without
being
suspicious,
i
suppose
the
proof
of
paternity
you
assume
it.
you
prove
it
by
outward
manifestation
of
family
membership.
in
this
instance,
the
posthumous
child
that
the
mother
conceived
the
child,
she
was
pregnant
had
no
doubt
in
the
record,
it’s
not
in
dispute
that
henry
clyde
stoke,
the
deceased
employee
was
the
father
of
the
child.
now
--
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
not
of
paternity,
of
maternity,
even
though
louisiana
law
requires
--
well,
it’s
earn
settle
in
louisiana
as
to
whether
or
not
what
we
call
an
informal
acknowledgement
of
an
illegitimate
child,
lifts
that
child
from
the
object
of
lowest
level
of
which
the
civil
code
say
it
is
known
by
the
escalation
basket,
whereas
the
child
acknowledged
either
formally
by
notarial
act
or
some
formal
act
or
informally
the
mother,
because
of
maternity
doesn’t
leave
open
the
question
of
uncertainty
as
to
parentage.
informal
acknowledgement
of
maternity
is
accepted
on
whereas
there
is
some
reservation
with
respect
to
informal
acknowledgement
of
paternity.
now
--
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
204
of
the
louisiana
civil
code.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
that
is
correct;
that
is
correct.
the
provision
for
acknowledgement,
for
formal
acknowledgement,
has
a
restriction.
the
restriction
is
that
a
parent
may
not
acknowledge
a
child,
either
informally
or
formally,
and
we
are
dealing
with
formally
here
if
at
the
time
of
conception,
there
was
an
impediment
to
the
marriage
of
the
parents
of
the
illegitimate
child.
in
this
instance,
sir,
there
would
have
been
a
bigger
but
myriad
mode
of
conception,
and
the
impediment
was
that
henry
clyde
still
was
lawfully
married
to
another
woman
and
therefore,
these
children
could
not
have
been
acknowledged.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
that
would
be
if
we
are
going
to
focus
our
attention
upon
what
is
argued
as
being
the
distinction
between
labine
and
levy
wherein
labine
apparently
is
saying
that
there
was
insurmountable
barrier
in
levy,
whereas
there
is
not
an
insurmountable
barrier
here
and
that
the
children
could
be
acknowledged.
of
course,
you
will
see
that
there
is
an
insurmountable
barrier
here
when
you
look
at
what
is
said
in
the
amicus
brief
and
what
the
louisiana
civil
code
actually
provides
under
204,
the
insurmountable
barrier
here
because
each
children
couldn’t
even
be
acknowledged.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
no.
as
i
recall
it,
it’s
a
carry
on
through
long
history
from
the
civil
law
or
sort
of
--
i
guess,
for
me
to
discourage,
which
was
rejected
in
levy
to
discourage
the
illicit
relationship
we
would
produce
or
also
to
prohibit
the
bringing
into
up
to
the
statehood
of
a
child,
a
child
where
the
parents
where
actually
married
to
each
other.
it’s
also
the
law
where
it’s
constitution
on
that
an
incestuous
marriage
would
prohibit
or
prevent
the
acknowledgement
of
the
child.
also,
to
the
extent
that
at
the
time
when
it
was
constitutional,
a
misogynous
(ph)
marriage
or
misogynous
relationship,
misogyny,
they
would
have
a
difference
in
rate.
it
would
have
been
an
impediment
to
the
marriage
consequently.
we
have
a
long
line
of
cases
where
a
lot
of
children
couldn’t
be
acknowledged.
now,
back
to
the
--
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
i
concede
that
that
is
a
rational
basis.
what
we
are
saying
here,
we
take
the
position
at
the
trust
of
labine
versus
vincent
is
not
to
reject
or
overrule
levy;
that
levy,
which
held
that
on
article
2315,
which
is
the
louisiana
basic
tort
law.
all
of
other
law
for
negligence
or
other
tort
claim
arise
or
get
its
source
from
article
2315
of
louisiana
civil
code,
which
provides
that
roughly
whoever
is
injured
as
result
of
the
act
of
another
is
entitled
to
reparation.
and
then
louisiana,
through
the
years
enacted
wrong
had
a
wrongful-death
statute
to
give
an
action
for
tort
for
death
to
survivors.
and
as
the
court
knows
in
levy,
the
plaintiffs
were
illegitimate
children
of
the
mother
who
died
as
result
of
an
alleged
tort.
and
the
denial
of
a
tort
cause
of
action
to
those
children
would
have
to
be
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
what
we
are
saying
here
if
levy
is
still
the
law,
then
labine,
it
seems
to
me,
took
pain
to
say
that
levy
is
still
the
law.
and
what
labine
is
saying
is
that
the
denial
of
inheritance
right
is
not
the
same
kind
of
denial
and
deprivation
that
in
a
tort
cause
of
action,
the
child,
as
justice
douglas
points
out,
is
nurtured
by
the
parent,
is
not
a
non-person.
the
child
is
loved
and
he
loses
the
same
thing
when
he
loses
his
parents,
his
mother,
in
that
instance,
the
legitimate
child.
now,
under
louisiana
law
it
really
wasn’t
compensation
law
although
all
the
other
state,
the
workmen’s
compensation
law
is
the
replacement
for
the
tort
law.
now,
so
2315
could
not
be
used
against
the
employer
here.
now
i
need
to
go
into
just
a
little
more
explanation
of
the
fact,
because
there
is
a
tie-in
between
with
workmen’s
compensation
and
the
louisiana
tort
law.
what
happened
further
in
this
case
was
that
the
grandmother
of
the
four
legitimate
children
sought
a
tort
action
against
a
third
party
tortfeasor
who
was
responsible
for
the
acts
of
death
in
which
the
employee
was
killed.
do
you
still
have
your
cause
of
action
against
your
third
party
for
tort
even
though
you
do
have
your
worker’s
compensation?
but
whatever
workmen’s
compensation
you
recover
from
your
third
party
tortfeasor,
you
owe
it,
the
beneficiary
will
owe
it
to
the
employer,
i.e.
to
insure
under
the
right
of
subrogation.
so
the
tort
suit
was
settled,
the
maximum
compensation
payable
in
louisiana
in
any
answers
at
that
time
was
$14,000.00.
the
tort
claim
exceeded
$14,000.00.
the
four
legitimate
children
then
came
back
into
the
state
court
and
dismissed
their
claim
for
workmen’s
compensation
on
the
basis
that
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
recover
anyway,
because
if
they
recovered,
the
right
would
belong
to
aetna
casualty
and
the
truck
driving
concerned
the
employer.
then
the
employer
and
its
insurer
moved
to
dismiss
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
--
the
workmen’s
compensation
had
been
exhausted,
and
we
had,
of
course,
pleaded
that
the
denial
of
workmen’s
compensation
to
the
two
illegitimate
children
would
constitute
the
denial
of
equal
protection
and
the
court
--
the
trial
court
held
that
they
were
entitled
to
workmen’s
compensation
but
only
if
there
was
any
left
after
the
four
legitimate
children
had
used
it
all
up.
so
from
that
we
appeal
on
that
and
what
happens
then
is
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
interpreting
the
workmen’s
compensation
law
of
louisiana
is
saying
that
you
have
six
children
born
of
a
man
who
are
his
dependents.
they
are
supported
by
him.
they
are
all
--
they
are
member
that
acted
the
family
unit
which
he
is
maintaining
at
the
time
of
his
life
and
at
the
time
of
his
death
as
a
family
unit
consisting
of
six
children.
the
out
of
wedlock
wife
or
the
mother
of
the
two
illegitimate
is
also
the
stepmother
of
the
legitimate.
so
everything
is
equal
insofar
as
the
nexus
or
the
relationship
between
the
father
and
the
six
children.
the
only
difference
between
the
four
who
got
the
workmen’s
compensation
and
the
two
who
did
not
is
that
the
four
was
legitimate
and
the
other
two
were
illegitimate.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
no,
if
acknowledged;
if
they
were
acknowledged,
acknowledged
illegitimate
children
would
be
beneficiary
under
the
louisiana
workmen’s
compensation
law.
formerly
acknowledged
illegitimate,
if
those
children
have
been
acknowledged
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
workmen’s
compensation.
if
i
understand
mr.
chief
justice
question
correctly.
i
think
i
have
just
about
covered
the
essential
feature
of
the
case
except,
i
have
to
reemphasize
that
we
believe
what
we
are
arguing
here
is
exactly
what
labine,
that
is
the
louisiana
case
involving
inheritance,
the
reservation
of
labine.
we
believe
also
that
if
the
answer
insurmountable
barrier
is
the
distinction,
if
i
am
clear
in
pointing
out
what
had
happened
in
this
case,
there
is
no
opportunity
for
the
two
illegitimate
children
to
get
any
workmen’s
compensation
here
unless
by
sheer
accident,
because
if
i
may
point
out,
the
$14,000.00
maximum
workmen’s
compensation
was
never
paid
by
the
compensation
carrier;
it
was
paid
by
the
third
party
tortfeasor.
the
compensation,
the
employer
and
the
insurer
got
credit
for
it
because
automatically
they
would
get
credit
for
under
louisiana
workmen’s
compensation
law.
ordinarily,
workmen’s
compensation
benefits
are
paid
weekly.
it
would
have
been
$35.00
a
week
here
for
400
weeks.
here
it
was
not
done
that
way,
there
is
no
money
coming
in
so
that
if
one
of
the
legitimate
should
die
short
of
reaching
adulthood,
one
of
the
illegitimate
would
step
in,
that’s
what
it
meant
under
louisiana
law.
it
is
not
exhausted.
here,
it’s
all
gone
and
so
the
court
just
effectively
closed
the
door
against
the
two
illegitimates
and
saying
your
six
children
living
at
one
family
unit
all
equally
supported
by
the
father,
no
apparent
difference
in
his
treatment
in
what
he
would
have
wished
for
them
to
have,
but
because
the
two
are
illegitimate,
the
four
gets
all
of
the
workmen’s
compensation
and
the
other
two
are
left
upon
(inaudible).
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
yes,
it
would
have
been;
it
would
have
been.
if
204
--
if
there
had
not
been
an
impediment,
he
could
have
acknowledged
them,
and
if
he
had
acknowledged
them
under
louisiana
workmen’s
compensation
law,
they
would
have
been
entitled
to.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
it
wouldn’t
have
been
any
different.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
if
he
could
have
but
didn’t
then
they
would
have
been
excluded
from
workmen’s
compensation.
in
extent,
i
think
perhaps
we
need
to
clear
this
point.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
yes.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
right.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
we
would
still
be
arguing
this
mr.
justice.
we
would
still
be
arguing
that
you
are
excluding
them
because
they
are
illegitimate,
and
if
they
are,
in
every
way,
equally
dependent
upon
the
father
and
it
is
established
and
undisputed
in
the
record
that
they
are
his
children.
then
the
exclusion
of
them
from
participation
in
workmen’s
compensation
along
with
the
other
children
who
had
no
more
dependency
upon
the
father
than
they
had
would
still
be
an
invidious,
arbitrary
and
capricious
without
any
basis
at
all
other
than
they
are
illegitimate
and
the
other
four
are
legitimate.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
well,
you
would
say
then
that
that
would
probably
be
the
argument
under
labine
versus
vincent
that
that
he
had
a
way.
but
i
am
not
willing
in
my
argument
here
that
i
think
is
more
eye
catching
than
the
real
distinction
of
labine.
i
don’t
think
that
insurmountable
barrier
which
was
pointed
out
by
the
court
there
is
it
really
the
real
reason
as
you
read
underneath
here
that
inheritance
is
--
if
they
are
not
involve
the
same
kind
of
nexus
and
attachment
in
human
relation
between
people
that
parent
and
children
do
and
that
when
you
deny
talk
cause
of
action
to
a
child
whose
parent’s
life
has
been
snuffed
out,
you
are
denying
reparation
for
a
deprivation.
but
when
you
deny
the
law
of
succession
and
the
state
say
you
go
this
way
or
that
way,
the
state
is
not
pinpointing
and
saying
you
lost
something
but
you
can’t
get
any
reparation,
because
you’re
illegitimate.
the
state
is
just
saying,
you
don’t
fall
in
that
class
under
who
ruled
you
would
get
a
right
of
inheritance,
and
i
think
the
real
distinction
between
labine
and
vincent
is
not
the
insurmountable
barrier
but
the
real
invidiousness
of
telling
one
who
has
lost
his
parent,
you
cannot
get
a
reparation
that
one
is
entitled
to
from
lost
of
the
parent
merely
because
you
are
illegitimate.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
thank
you.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
just
three
comment,
may
it
please
the
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
an
argument
is
made
here
that
the
employer
and
its
compensation
insurer
would
perhaps
be
prejudice
by
a
non
payable
decision
in
that
now
proscription
has
run,
they
would
not
and
it
would
be
without
their
remedy
of
subrogation.
but
the
record
will
show
however
that
the
circumstances
in
which
the
employer
or
any
its
insurer
find
itself
now
really
was
part
of
its
own
doing,
the
court
should
--
i
want
the
court
to
know
that
the
illegitimate
children
were
brought
into
the
suit
by
what
do
we
call
(inaudible)
in
louisiana
by
interpleader
by
the
compensation
carrier
in
order
to
assure
itself
that
it
would
get
everybody
in
the
court
and
have
finally
decide
so
it
wouldn’t
be
left
or
paying
multiple
payments
or
just
to
avoid
what
normally
interpleader
avoid.
however,
at
this
turn
of
the
event,
when
it
found
itself
entitled
to
the
all
set
and
the
legitimate
children
dismissed
it
too,
it
had
its
fair
opportunity
to
uphold
the
dismissal
and
have
the
things
finally
litigated.
so,
any
prejudice
really
that
itself
is
not
called
by
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
appellants
you
know
would
it
result
to
any
in
affirmance
by
the
court
but
really
be
the
result
of
that
choice
made
in
the
court
below.
now
the
allusion
it
made
also
to
what
the
court
said
in
levy
that
of
defendants
of
louisiana
of
course
in
my
brief
i
footnote
that
point
and
when
i
first
read
it,
when
levy
was
quite
decided,
it
was
mindful
of
the
fact
that
it
did
not
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
the
fairness
or
the
permission
of
the
allowance
of
workmen’s
compensation
to
illegitimate
children,
such
as
the
court
saw
there,
was
not
because
they
were
children,
and
i
want
the
court
--
i
want
to
get
it
clearly
understood
and
try
to
get
it
across
that
the
illegitimate
children
when
they
come
in
under
classification
eight
to
witness
that
more
alludes,
come
in
as
other
dependents
and
anybody
else
who
might
be
a
member
of
a
family
they’re
not
because
they
are
the
children
but
have
been
an
aunt,
or
had
been
a
maid,
or
had
been
an
uncle
living
in
the
family
and
he
could
show
that
dependency
of
that
family
and
there
were
not
enough
legitimate
children
to
use
up
the
workmen’s
compensation
he
would
come
in
so
this
little
children
are
thrown
with
this
crowd
that
happen
to
be
dependent
and
they’re
not
respected
as
dependent
member
or
children
who
have
that
nexus
that
we’re
talking
about
that
the
court
was
talking
about
in
levy
and
that
is
really
the
workmen’s
compensation
replace
it
2315
here
and
if
to
disregard
the
children
as
it
did
on
the
workmen
on
the
2315
on
the
tort
it
is
invidious
discrimination.
you’re
taking
away
from
them
here
the
very
same
thing
in
the
ninth
and
the
very
same
thing
under
guide
of
workmen’s
compensation
that
would
been
denied
on
the
levy
so
with
that
--
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
yes.
yes,
if
he
has
approved
dependency
and
provide
it
--
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
and
provided
the
nature
that
would
have
taken
even
though
they
were
unacknowledged,
incapable
of
being
acknowledged
illegitimate
would
have
taken
whatever
promise
that
have
been
left
if
they
had
not
been
a
enough
people
to
use
up
all
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
yes,
not
only
proving
the
fact
of
being
fair
and
having
the
nexus
to
apply
the
need
the
same
reparation
for
the
loss
of
a
parent
that
has
illegitimate
children.
mr.
vanue
b.
lacour
right.
not
in
the
both
bases,
but
indeed
particular
facts
on
this
petition
case
was
one
family
unit
and
there
is
nothing
nor
the
reason
to
mistreat
these
two
children
here
as
they
were
mistreated
and
that
they
were
illegitimate.
yes
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
invidious
in
any
case
as
now
as
this.
if
--
i
don’t
see
how
we
can
escape
seeing
invidiousness
of
treating
those
children,
and
we
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
ought
to
be
reversed
and
the
case
be
remanded
for
the
appropriate
relief.
thank
you.
