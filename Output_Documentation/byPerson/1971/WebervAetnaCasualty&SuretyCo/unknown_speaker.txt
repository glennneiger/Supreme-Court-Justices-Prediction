mr.
lacour,
would
your
case
be
any
different
if
204
were
not
present,
if
the
barrier
of
204
were
not
there,
and
he
just
had
not
acknowledge
his
children.
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
could
happen?
does
your
case
would
be
any
different?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
my
question.
if
he
could
have
but
didn’t?
unknown
speaker
would
you
still
be
acting
on
their
exclusion
or
not?
unknown
speaker
he
could
have
acknowledge
them
but
didn’t.
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
dies,
was
these
unacknowledged
children
be
entitled
to
--
unknown
speaker
except
that
he
had
a
way
to
acknowledge
them
and
didn’t
pursue
that
way?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
decedent
had
no
legitimate
children,
no
one
but
had
one
parent?
unknown
speaker
then
the
thirty-two
and
one-half
percent
would
go
to
illegitimate
children?
unknown
speaker
right
there
mr.
moore,
do
you
concede
that
these
children
could
not
have
been
acknowledged
under
204?
