mr.
harold
j.
birch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
this
court
this
afternoon
is
relatively
easy
to
state,
simply
it
is
a
combination
claim
of
the
united
states
patent,
infringed
by
one
who
manufactures
and
sells
the
separate
parts
in
the
united
states,
when
all
assembly
end
use
takes
place
in
a
foreign
country.
i
suppose
even
more
simply
the
question
could
be
stated,
does
a
combination
claim
of
the
united
states
patent,
reach
separate,
unassembled
parts
or
is
it
limited
to
the
combination,
the
assembled
combination.
it
is
petitioner's
view
here
that
there
is
no
infringement
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
a
combination
claim
reaches
only
the
assembled
combination
and
that
it
does
not
reach
the
separate
parts.
as
far
as
our
considerations
here
are
concerned,
the
ship
which
took
deepsouth's
parts
from
the
peer
in
and
new
orleans
might
as
well
have
sunk
five
miles
offshore,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
a
combination
claim
means
what
this
court
consistently
has
held
it
means
and
what
the
statute
says
it
means.
now,
perhaps
prior
to
getting
into
the
facts,
that
is
the
claim,
it
would
be
well
for
the
court
to
review
or
for
me
to
review
for
the
court
briefly
what
got
us
here.
this
case
began
as
an
infringement
case
in
the
district
court
in
louisiana.
the
respondent,
laitram
corporation
brought
suit
against
petitioner
deepsouth,
for
infringement
of
two
patents.
now
one
of
those
patents
we
call
the
slitter
patent.
its
number
is
2694218;
the
other
is
called
the
tumbler
or
deveiner
patent
and
its
number
is
2825927.
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
if
i
may,
to
the
large
buff
colored
appendix
and
more
particularly
to
page
114.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
this
court
has
refused
certiorari
mr.
justice
douglas,
with
respect
to
the
questions
presented
on
validity.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
it's
purely
the
infringement
question
as
posed
in
my
opening
statement.
you
will
note
on
page
114,
in
figure
1,
there
is
a
device
shown,
that's
the
only
device
disclosed
in
this
patent
and
the
court
will
see
that
it
consists
of
an
inclined
trough
razor
blades
there
only
one
set,
zigzagging
down
the
trough
and
water
sprays
downward
upon
the
top
of
the
blades
can
shrimp
if
they
could
be
there
in
a
right
angle
direction.
now,
if
you
will
then
turn
to
page
443
of
the
index,
which
is
in
the
supplement,
you
will
find
a
picture
of
laitram's
commercial
device,
which
shows
a
plurality
of
blades
on
the
trough.
the
only
other
difference
being
that
the
water
sprays
are
omitted
in
the
commercial
device,
omitted
because
they
didn't
work
to
devein.
now
if
your
honors,
then
we
will
turn
to
the
large
appendix
book
to
page
120,
you
will
see
figure
1
of
the
patent
there
which
discloses
the
commercial
embodiment
of
the
laitram
deveiner,
which
is
a
drum,
a
cylindrical
drum
to
which
the
slit
shrimp
are
fed
and
as
they
go
through
the
drum
with
a
residence
time
of
between
one
and
two
minutes,
the
veins
which
have
been
exposed
by
the
slitting
procedure
with
the
previous
apparatus
are
either
pulled
out
if
they
are
hanging
free
or
dug
out
if
they
are
not.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
that's
on
page
122
mr.
justice
douglas,
or
120,
essentially
the
same
picture
shows
in
both.
if
you
again
will
look
at
the
small
appendix
on
pages
445
and
446,
you
will
see
a
picture
of
the
laitram.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
oh,
i
am
terribly
sorry,
mr.
justice
douglas.
we
tried
to
correct
that
with
the
clerk,
may
i
give
you
mine
or
--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
well,
i
think
so.
i
don't
think
there's
any
constitutional
prohibition
on
that.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
the
reason
being
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
court
has
been
very
explicit
in
saying
that
a
combination
of
old
elements
presents
a
particular
problem
and
all
of
the
elements
here
are
old.
the
court
has
said
that
when
you
are
looking
to
the
issue
of
infringement,
you
therefore
look
very
carefully
at
the
elements
whether
or
not
they
are
new
and
whether
or
not
there
is
a
co-action,
the
synergism
which
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
anderson's
black
rock
pointed
out
so
clearly.
and
i
really
wanted
the
court
to
see
what
the
device
was
like.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
now
if
i
may
invite
to
court's
attention
to
page
7
of
our
blue
brief,
petitioner's
blue
brief.
you
will
see
reaching
that
page
the
very
concise
three
element
combination
claim
that
is
involved.
and
since
it
is
very
short,
i
would
like
to
examine
with
you
the
three
elements.
an
inclined
trough
down
which
shrimp
are
induced
to
slide,
secondly
a
knife
in
said
trough
positioned
to
be
encountered
by
shrimp
to
cut
the
membrane
confining
the
vein,
and
third
a
water
spray
to
the
trough
directed
upon
the
shrimp
for
sliding
them
down
to
the
trough
and
flushing
out
the
vein,
as
indicated
the
flushing
didn't
occur
and
that
necessitated
the
second
patent.
if
your
honors
will
then
look
at
page
9
of
the
blue
brief
you
will
see
the
three
element
combination
claim
which
is
involved
in
the
second
or
927
patent.
very
briefly
one,
a
support
member,
two
a
lip
protruding
at
an
acute
angle
from
the
support
member,
and
then
three
means
operatively
associated
with
the
support
for
relatively
moving
the
shrimp
with
respect
to
said
member
to
cause
separation
of
the
vein.
now
in
the
1972
--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
probably
no
different
if
i
understood
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
typewriter's
parts
were
all
old.
i
am
assuming
that
they
are
not
and
they
are
all
old
here,
but
going
from
this
question
to
the
law,
i
think
whatever
the
combination
is,
the
decisions
of
this
court
foreclose
in
our
view,
an
affirmance
of
the
court
below
and
so
does
35
u.s.
code
271
subsections
(a)
and
(c).
now
--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
no
i
wouldn't
take
that
position
at
all
mr.
justice
white,
if
the
bolt
is
a
resided
element
this
court's
decisions
and
particularly
that
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
say
clearly
that
all
resided
elements
in
a
combination
claim
are
critical.
if
that
is
so
and
the
bolt
is
resided
as
an
element
our
law
says,
that
that
would
not
result
in
an
infringement.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
that
is
the
law
of
this
court
as
i
understand
it.
and
the
aro
case
clearly
says
that
the
law
of
this
court
has
been
carried
forward
without
change
in
section
271
(a).
of
course,
here
we
don't
simply
have
one
bolt
or
one
screw,
what
we
have
are
the
three
elements
in
each
of
the
combinations
and
no
one
of
those
elements
with
the
exception
of
the
fingernail
belt
in
the
deveiner
patent;
ever
were
joined
to
the
other,
they
were
separately
manufactured,
separately
shipped
and
never
joined
together
in
the
united
states
or
united
states
patents
are
affected.
now,
going
to
271
(a)
the
congress
has
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
direct
infringement
which
again
this
court
has
held
271
(a)
embodies
the
law
of
this
court.
says,
that
whoever
without
authority
makes
uses
or
sells
any
patented
invention
within
the
united
states
infringes
the
patent.
what
that
provision
is
clearly
telling
us
is
not
that
someone
who
makes
a
machine
or
sells
a
machine
shall
be
an
infringer.
it
says
whoever
shall
make
use
or
sell
any
patented
invention,
and
i
underscore
that,
shall
infringe
the
patent.
when
we
get
down
to
subsection
(c),
we
there
have
the
provision
which
congress
enacted
specifically
to
take
care
of
the
person
who
made
the
parts,
but
did
not
directly
infringe
by
assembling
the
combination.
and
as
this
court
knows,
c
resulted
from
an
effort
by
congress
to
resuscitate
in
part,
the
contributory
infringement
doctrine,
which
i
think
was
given
the
(inaudible)
by
this
court
in
the
mercoid
decisions.
now,
turning
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
which
are
very
pertinent
and
many
of
them
squarely
in
the
point.
in
point
not
to
the
foreign
shipment,
but
in
point
to
the
question
of
what
infringes
a
combination
claim.
i
would
like
the
court
just
to
consider
with
me
briefly
a
few
of
them
which
are
very
germane.
the
first
of
those
starting
out
early
indeed
in
1840,
was
the
prouty
v.
ruggles
decision,
where
the
same
three
elements
we
are
dealing
with
here,
that
is
the
three
element
combination
claim
was
involved.
there,
this
court
held
that
the
union
of
all
the
parts
arranged
and
combined
together
in
the
manner
described,
is
the
thing
patented.
in
other
words,
in
the
words
of
the
section
271
(a),
the
patented
invention
is
the
parts
combined
together
is
the
thing
patented,
and
that
case
appears
on
19
of
our
main
brief.
then
some
years
later,
this
court
in
the
leads
cases
which
have
been
very
widely,
widely
cited
and
which
relate
to
a
phonograph,
and
a
record
in
combination
held
with
respect
to
the
parts
that
no
one
part
of
a
resided
combination
is
the
combination.
indeed
says
this
court,
all
of
the
elements
are
not,
they
must
be
united
by
the
same
operation
of
law,
that
same
decision
repeated
in
the
companion
case.
i
would
like
the
court
at
this
point
to
consider
two
cases
which
appear
later
in
our
blue
brief
at
pages
33
and
34,
which
i
suggest
are
squarely
in
point
and
controlling
with
respect
to
the
law
of
this
court
on
the
infringement
of
combination
claims.
the
first
of
those
decisions
both
being
written
by
mr.
justice
hughes
is
the
case
of
woodward
v.
hurd,
the
second
seim
v.
hurd,
both
decided
in
1914.
now
these
two
cases
present
the
classic
situations,
as
decided
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
what
constitutes
direct
and
what
constitutes
contributory
infringement.
here
the
patented
device
was
again
a
three
element
combination,
a
rim,
a
wheel,
a
rim
of
the
wheel,
a
tyre
and
wires
which
tighten
the
rubber
tyre
in
the
rim.
the
two
cases
were
brought,
one
against
the
man
who
sold
all
the
parts,
and
the
other
against
the
man
who
bought
the
parts
and
assembled
them
for
the
first
time
and
woodward
--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
if
it
were
first
assembled
mr.
chief
justice,
and
then
disassembled,
the
first
assembly
would
concededly
constitute
an
infringement,
because
the
invention
would
be
made
within
the
united
states.
if
they
are
never
put
together
in
accordance
the
with
these
decisions,
we
are
considering
the
invention
is
never
made.
therefore,
any
subsequent
assembly
outside
of
the
country
results
in
no
invention
of
the
combination
claim
ever
being
made.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
that
is
correct
and
of
course,
we
differ
with
fifth
circuit
very
vigorously.
there
is
nothing
artificial
about
granting
a
patent,
and
then
restricting
the
patentee
to
the
claim
he
solicited
from
the
patent
office.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
no
i
do
not,
because
those
are
the
rules
of
our
game,
and
i
don't
think
they
are
artificial.
the
statute
says
makes,
that's
the
making
of
the
invention.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
well,
they
went
in
not
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
they
were
not
even
looked
at,
they
were
ignored.
they
really
didn't
look
at
the
statute
at
all,
they
based
their
decision
on
a
theory
of
economic
injustice.
but
where
as
we
ask
is
economic
injustice
involved?
where
that
which
is
being
done
is
right,
and
not
a
wrong.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
we
are
coming
to
that.
all
i
wanted
to
establish
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
what
the
law
was
in
this
court
and
i
think
it's
clear
and
there
is
no
dissenting
voice
in
any
decision
of
the
court.
now
when
we
get
to
the
policy
decisions,
several
of
them
have
been
set
forth
in
respondent's
brief
and
also
by
the
court
below.
in
the
first
place,
they
say
that
you
should
protect
a
foreign
market
for
a
domestic
patentee.
i
see
no
policy
that
requires
or
even
suggests
that
a
foreign
market
should
be
protected
by
a
domestic
patent,
that
patent
is
to
protect
the
patentee
in
the
united
states.
271(a)
clearly
says
that,
if
there
is
making,
using
or
selling
within
the
united
states,
it
doesn't
say
brazil.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
i
don't
think
--
i
think
they
are
exempt.
that's
the
very
point
of
the
argument.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
if
they
blew
--
you
mean,
if
they’re
assembled
in
the
united
states--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
yes.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
because
our
law
which
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
pointed
out,
if
it's
there,
we
have
to
content
with
it
or
reverse
it.
our
law
says
there
is
no
infringement
unless
it
is
made
within
the
united
states.
and
if
it
is
not,
then
there
is
no
wrong
to
be
enjoined.
that
i
think
is
the
answer
to
the
question.
now,
our
understanding
of
the
purpose
of
the
patent,
as
very
clearly
pointed
out
again
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
first
mercoid
decision
is
that
we
have
the
public
interest
being
paramount.
the
right
to
freely
compete
being
paramount.
and
the
only
thing
you
subtract
from
that
with
the
limited
monopoly,
that's
given
by
a
patent
for
a
very
limited
purpose
is
that
which
is
clearly
within
the
scope
of
the
grant
and
if
a
combination
claim
is
awarded
only
because
the
combination
is
the
invention,
there
is
no
infringement,
there
is
nothing
that
should
properly
be
taken
away
from
the
public,
when
that
combination
does
not
come
into
being,
within
the
united
states.
perhaps
--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
i
think
that
is
his
responsibility.
if
he
is
going
to
employ
the
economy
of
the
foreign
country
to
make
his
money,
if
he
is
going
to
do
his
merchandising
there,
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
the
difference
between
our
own
state
courts.
if
someone
is
going
to
come
in
and
use
the
economy
of
the
state,
they
should
go
to
that
state
court
for
their
redress,
i
think
the
same
is
true
in
the
foreign
country
and
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
well
there
is
no
reason
for
our
client
to
do
anything
in
the
absence
of
a
brazilian
patent.
now
there
is
a
brazilian
patent
and
these
parties
are
now
involved
in
litigation,
the
customer
that
brought
about
this
suit
here
is
involved
in
litigation
with
laitram
in
brazil
because
they
bought
the
parts.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
yes.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
there
is,
and
i
have
the
complaint
here
in
both
spanish
and
english,
i
cannot
read
the
spanish.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
well
not
necessarily,
because
shrimp
show
up
in
relatively
few
countries
around
the
world.
i
would
answer
you
yes,
whether
our
shrimp
yes,
but
that's
where
he
is
making
his
money.
and
i
see
no
fair
reason
why
he
shouldn't
be
expected
to
use
the
patent
system
in
the
courts
of
that
country
where
he
is
making
his
money,
in
order
to
protect
his
invention
there.
united
states
patents
by
definition
do
not
have
extraterritoriality.
now
there
are
some
statements
made
in
respondent's
brief
with
respect
to
copyrights.
if
the
court
will
examine
those
cases
you
will
find
that
there
are
two
copyrights
that's
in
appendix
a,
mr.
chief
justice.
copyrights
also
have
no
extraterritoriality.
the
reason
being
that
the
copyright
and
the
patent
arose
under
the
patent
clause
of
the
constitution.
trademarks
and
antitrust
prosecution
arose
under
the
commerce
clause
and
that's
a
whole
different
ball
game.
but
with
regard
to
both
patents
and
its
copyrights,
it's
clear
they
are
to
have
by
the
decisions
to
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts,
no
extraterritorial
effect.
now,
the
second
policy
consideration
raised
is
that
affirmance
of
court
below
would
prevent
evasion
of
combination
patents.
our
answer
to
that
is
that
under
the
law
of
this
court
and
the
law
that
has
existed
for
180
years
and
gone
through
a
codification
in
1952
reportedly
without
change,
there
is
no
evasion.
you
have
a
right
to
operate
outside
the
scope
of
claims
and
that's
all
that
petitioner
and
people
in
the
same
position
here
did.
it's
urged
that
there
is
discrimination
between
manufacturers
of
large
devices
and
small
devices.
the
manufacturer
of
the
small
device
has
every
opportunity
to
sell
his
device
in
parts
as
the
manufacturer
of
the
large
device.
and
notice
that
in
the
three
conflicting
cases,
in
the
second,
third
and
the
seventh
circuits
all
sorts
of
devices
are
involved.
in
andrea
where
the
decision
was
against
that
of
the
fifth
circuit,
a
radio
was
involved
and
it
was
a
question
of
of
whether
the
tools
could
or
could
not
be
put
in
with
or
without
infringement.
in
the
cold
metal
case
there
was
a
three-element
combination
again
of
rolls,
journals
and
bearings.
then
in
the
hewitt-robins
case
in
1965
and
1966
in
the
seventh
circuit,
there
was
a
huge
machine
involved
which
were
shipped
in
parts,
a
bridge,
a
reclaimer
wheel
and
supporting
structure.
but
the
small
man
has
every
bit
as
big
an
opportunity
to
send
his
equipment
overseas
unassembled
as
the
large
one.
then
the
point
is
raised
that
unless
the
court
below
is
affirmed,
there
will
be
a
multiplicity
of
lawsuits.
that
one
escapes
me
completely.
as
of
the
law
now,
with
the
three
conflicting
decisions
squarely
in
point
and
the
law
of
this
court
stating
that
there
is
no
infringement
of
a
combination
claim
without
assembling,
there
is
no
action
that
can
be
properly
brought
against
the
person
who
sells
only
the
parts.
if
the
fifth
circuit
is
affirmed
on
the
other
hand,
you
not
only
have
direct
infringement
against
the
manufacturer
of
the
parts,
you
have
direct
infringement
against
a
factor
who
goes
out
as
the
man
in
woodward
v.
hurd
did
and
buys
all
the
parts,
collects
them
together
and
resells
them.
and
then
you
will
have
an
action
for
contributory
infringement
against
every
vendor
who
supplies
a
part
that
isn't
a
stable
article
of
commerce
if
that
part
is
especially
adapted
to
go
into
the
combination.
so
as
far
as
litigation
is
concerned,
i
think
you
are
opening
pandora's
box.
there
will
be
a
great
multiplicity
of
lawsuits
resulting
from
an
affirmance
of
the
court
below.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
not
at
all.
if
the
box
was
shipped
outside
of
the
united
states
and
there
was
no
assembling.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
the
statute
is
specifically
designed
to
take
care
of
precisely
that.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
he
would
be
a
contributory
infringer
under
271
(c)
mr.
harold
j.
birch
it
would
not
be
a
--
but
the
same
remedy
would
lie
and
the
same
recovery
against
the
same
defendant
would
be
obtainable.
the
fact
that
you
are
calling
a
contributory
infringer
in
section
c.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
yes,
the
difference
between
direct
and
contributory
is
semantic
as
long
as
what
occurs
--.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
yes,
you
too
would
be
an
infringer.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
that
is
correct
but
as
has
been
pointed
out
in
respondent's
brief
there
is
a
rather
strong
policy
in
this
country
not
to
go
around
suing
and
the
courts
do
not
favor
suits
against
individuals
who
would
be
in
your
position
with
the
bruised
fingers.
but
--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
he
would
be
a
contributory.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
that
is
correct
and
he
could
be
sued
and
full
recovery
got
from
the
man
who
manufactured
and/or
sold
the
parts.
it
is
only
when
you
don't
assemble
in
the
united
states
that
this
question
comes
up.
and
as
the
andrea
case
had
said
this
really
isn't
the
technicality
that
it
is
accused
of
being,
because
no
wrong
is
done
and
no
wrong
is
done
because
no
infringement
occurs.
and
if
no
infringement
occurs,
no
liability
and
that
is
the
firm
policy
behind
those
three
decisions
and
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
backed
that
up
completely.
i
have
--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
deepsouth
has
one
very
small
factory.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
everything
that
is
sold
by
deepsouth
is
made
in
one
small
building
and
i
believe
there
is
a
total
workforce
of
four
or
five.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
individuals,
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
no
the
completed
device
is
not
put
together.
two
of
the
elements
are.
the
water
header,
the
trough
which
is
a
reciprocating
trough
in
the
deepsouth
design
are
put
together.
the
razor
blades,
the
long
blades
that
go
to
full
length
of
the
trough
are
always
supplied
separately,
perhaps
for
the
reasons
suggested
before
cut
fingers
and
the
like.
they
are
put
together
by
the
customer.
deepsouth
was
held
however
to
be
an
infringer
under
those
circumstances
and
laitram
has
full
recourse
against
them
under
that
decision
just
as
if
it
had
been
manufactured
entirely.
now
the
belt
conveyor
or
the
deveiner
has
in
fact,
always
been
manufactured
completely
by
deepsouth.
i
have
just
a
few
minutes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
them
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
brief
of
respondent
has
gone
at
great
lengths
and
the
same
argument
has
been
made
here
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
machine.
that
is
a
red
hearing.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
patented
invention.
i
think
that
was
made
clear
by
the
questions
from
the
bench.
you
don't
make
a
machine
with
an
invoice
or
a
letter
or
a
letter
of
credit,
you
make
it
with
nuts
and
bolts
and
wrenches
and
this
was
what
was
done
only
in
brazil.
now
there
is
no
total
emasculation
of
a
man's
rights,
if
he
doesn't
get
a
patent
which
covers
him
in
the
united
states,
whatever
it
is
he's
sold,
if
he
can
go
into
the
foreign
country
and
get
it,
he
is
protected.
again,
that's
where
he
makes
his
profit,
that's
where
his
market
is.
now
all
of
these
equitable
doctrines
of
doctrine
of
equivalence,
doctrine
of
negative
equivalence
and
the
like,
all
depend
upon
something
that
mr.
shoup
has
not
mentioned
and
that
is
the
making
of
an
invention
in
the
first
place.
unless
an
invention
is
made,
there
is
no
equivalent
to
worry
about.
the
point
here
is
that
an
invention
is
not
made
in
the
combination
sentence,
and
i
believe
it
is
most
material
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
brought
up,
that
if
the
law
is
that
you
must
assemble
the
combination
in
order
to
have
something
patentable,
you
must
reverse.
that
is
the
law
of
this
court.
it
is
no
subterfuge,
that
is
what
the
man
got
his
patent
for,
a
combination,
unless
the
defendant
makes
it,
there
is
no
infringement.
that
is
a
technicality,
that's
just
giving
the
man
what
he
has
coming
to
him.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
that
is
correct,
that
is
clear
from
aro
(ph).
unless
there
is
a
direct
infringement,
there
can
be
no
contributory
infringement
and
there
is
no
direct
infringement
as
we've
pointed
out
in
the
supreme
court
cases
before,
are
squarely
on
target,
it
didn't
correct
to
say
there
is
no
authority,
there
is
authority.
thank
you.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
this
court
this
afternoon
is
relatively
easy
to
state,
simply
it
is
a
combination
claim
of
the
united
states
patent,
infringed
by
one
who
manufactures
and
sells
the
separate
parts
in
the
united
states,
when
all
assembly
end
use
takes
place
in
a
foreign
country.
i
suppose
even
more
simply
the
question
could
be
stated,
does
a
combination
claim
of
the
united
states
patent,
reach
separate,
unassembled
parts
or
is
it
limited
to
the
combination,
the
assembled
combination.
it
is
petitioner's
view
here
that
there
is
no
infringement
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
a
combination
claim
reaches
only
the
assembled
combination
and
that
it
does
not
reach
the
separate
parts.
as
far
as
our
considerations
here
are
concerned,
the
ship
which
took
deepsouth's
parts
from
the
peer
in
and
new
orleans
might
as
well
have
sunk
five
miles
offshore,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
a
combination
claim
means
what
this
court
consistently
has
held
it
means
and
what
the
statute
says
it
means.
now,
perhaps
prior
to
getting
into
the
facts,
that
is
the
claim,
it
would
be
well
for
the
court
to
review
or
for
me
to
review
for
the
court
briefly
what
got
us
here.
this
case
began
as
an
infringement
case
in
the
district
court
in
louisiana.
the
respondent,
laitram
corporation
brought
suit
against
petitioner
deepsouth,
for
infringement
of
two
patents.
now
one
of
those
patents
we
call
the
slitter
patent.
its
number
is
2694218;
the
other
is
called
the
tumbler
or
deveiner
patent
and
its
number
is
2825927.
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
if
i
may,
to
the
large
buff
colored
appendix
and
more
particularly
to
page
114.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
this
court
has
refused
certiorari
mr.
justice
douglas,
with
respect
to
the
questions
presented
on
validity.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
it's
purely
the
infringement
question
as
posed
in
my
opening
statement.
you
will
note
on
page
114,
in
figure
1,
there
is
a
device
shown,
that's
the
only
device
disclosed
in
this
patent
and
the
court
will
see
that
it
consists
of
an
inclined
trough
razor
blades
there
only
one
set,
zigzagging
down
the
trough
and
water
sprays
downward
upon
the
top
of
the
blades
can
shrimp
if
they
could
be
there
in
a
right
angle
direction.
now,
if
you
will
then
turn
to
page
443
of
the
index,
which
is
in
the
supplement,
you
will
find
a
picture
of
laitram's
commercial
device,
which
shows
a
plurality
of
blades
on
the
trough.
the
only
other
difference
being
that
the
water
sprays
are
omitted
in
the
commercial
device,
omitted
because
they
didn't
work
to
devein.
now
if
your
honors,
then
we
will
turn
to
the
large
appendix
book
to
page
120,
you
will
see
figure
1
of
the
patent
there
which
discloses
the
commercial
embodiment
of
the
laitram
deveiner,
which
is
a
drum,
a
cylindrical
drum
to
which
the
slit
shrimp
are
fed
and
as
they
go
through
the
drum
with
a
residence
time
of
between
one
and
two
minutes,
the
veins
which
have
been
exposed
by
the
slitting
procedure
with
the
previous
apparatus
are
either
pulled
out
if
they
are
hanging
free
or
dug
out
if
they
are
not.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
that's
on
page
122
mr.
justice
douglas,
or
120,
essentially
the
same
picture
shows
in
both.
if
you
again
will
look
at
the
small
appendix
on
pages
445
and
446,
you
will
see
a
picture
of
the
laitram.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
oh,
i
am
terribly
sorry,
mr.
justice
douglas.
we
tried
to
correct
that
with
the
clerk,
may
i
give
you
mine
or
--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
well,
i
think
so.
i
don't
think
there's
any
constitutional
prohibition
on
that.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
the
reason
being
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
court
has
been
very
explicit
in
saying
that
a
combination
of
old
elements
presents
a
particular
problem
and
all
of
the
elements
here
are
old.
the
court
has
said
that
when
you
are
looking
to
the
issue
of
infringement,
you
therefore
look
very
carefully
at
the
elements
whether
or
not
they
are
new
and
whether
or
not
there
is
a
co-action,
the
synergism
which
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
anderson's
black
rock
pointed
out
so
clearly.
and
i
really
wanted
the
court
to
see
what
the
device
was
like.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
now
if
i
may
invite
to
court's
attention
to
page
7
of
our
blue
brief,
petitioner's
blue
brief.
you
will
see
reaching
that
page
the
very
concise
three
element
combination
claim
that
is
involved.
and
since
it
is
very
short,
i
would
like
to
examine
with
you
the
three
elements.
an
inclined
trough
down
which
shrimp
are
induced
to
slide,
secondly
a
knife
in
said
trough
positioned
to
be
encountered
by
shrimp
to
cut
the
membrane
confining
the
vein,
and
third
a
water
spray
to
the
trough
directed
upon
the
shrimp
for
sliding
them
down
to
the
trough
and
flushing
out
the
vein,
as
indicated
the
flushing
didn't
occur
and
that
necessitated
the
second
patent.
if
your
honors
will
then
look
at
page
9
of
the
blue
brief
you
will
see
the
three
element
combination
claim
which
is
involved
in
the
second
or
927
patent.
very
briefly
one,
a
support
member,
two
a
lip
protruding
at
an
acute
angle
from
the
support
member,
and
then
three
means
operatively
associated
with
the
support
for
relatively
moving
the
shrimp
with
respect
to
said
member
to
cause
separation
of
the
vein.
now
in
the
1972
--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
probably
no
different
if
i
understood
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
typewriter's
parts
were
all
old.
i
am
assuming
that
they
are
not
and
they
are
all
old
here,
but
going
from
this
question
to
the
law,
i
think
whatever
the
combination
is,
the
decisions
of
this
court
foreclose
in
our
view,
an
affirmance
of
the
court
below
and
so
does
35
u.s.
code
271
subsections
(a)
and
(c).
now
--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
no
i
wouldn't
take
that
position
at
all
mr.
justice
white,
if
the
bolt
is
a
resided
element
this
court's
decisions
and
particularly
that
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
say
clearly
that
all
resided
elements
in
a
combination
claim
are
critical.
if
that
is
so
and
the
bolt
is
resided
as
an
element
our
law
says,
that
that
would
not
result
in
an
infringement.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
that
is
the
law
of
this
court
as
i
understand
it.
and
the
aro
case
clearly
says
that
the
law
of
this
court
has
been
carried
forward
without
change
in
section
271
(a).
of
course,
here
we
don't
simply
have
one
bolt
or
one
screw,
what
we
have
are
the
three
elements
in
each
of
the
combinations
and
no
one
of
those
elements
with
the
exception
of
the
fingernail
belt
in
the
deveiner
patent;
ever
were
joined
to
the
other,
they
were
separately
manufactured,
separately
shipped
and
never
joined
together
in
the
united
states
or
united
states
patents
are
affected.
now,
going
to
271
(a)
the
congress
has
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
direct
infringement
which
again
this
court
has
held
271
(a)
embodies
the
law
of
this
court.
says,
that
whoever
without
authority
makes
uses
or
sells
any
patented
invention
within
the
united
states
infringes
the
patent.
what
that
provision
is
clearly
telling
us
is
not
that
someone
who
makes
a
machine
or
sells
a
machine
shall
be
an
infringer.
it
says
whoever
shall
make
use
or
sell
any
patented
invention,
and
i
underscore
that,
shall
infringe
the
patent.
when
we
get
down
to
subsection
(c),
we
there
have
the
provision
which
congress
enacted
specifically
to
take
care
of
the
person
who
made
the
parts,
but
did
not
directly
infringe
by
assembling
the
combination.
and
as
this
court
knows,
c
resulted
from
an
effort
by
congress
to
resuscitate
in
part,
the
contributory
infringement
doctrine,
which
i
think
was
given
the
(inaudible)
by
this
court
in
the
mercoid
decisions.
now,
turning
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
which
are
very
pertinent
and
many
of
them
squarely
in
the
point.
in
point
not
to
the
foreign
shipment,
but
in
point
to
the
question
of
what
infringes
a
combination
claim.
i
would
like
the
court
just
to
consider
with
me
briefly
a
few
of
them
which
are
very
germane.
the
first
of
those
starting
out
early
indeed
in
1840,
was
the
prouty
v.
ruggles
decision,
where
the
same
three
elements
we
are
dealing
with
here,
that
is
the
three
element
combination
claim
was
involved.
there,
this
court
held
that
the
union
of
all
the
parts
arranged
and
combined
together
in
the
manner
described,
is
the
thing
patented.
in
other
words,
in
the
words
of
the
section
271
(a),
the
patented
invention
is
the
parts
combined
together
is
the
thing
patented,
and
that
case
appears
on
19
of
our
main
brief.
then
some
years
later,
this
court
in
the
leads
cases
which
have
been
very
widely,
widely
cited
and
which
relate
to
a
phonograph,
and
a
record
in
combination
held
with
respect
to
the
parts
that
no
one
part
of
a
resided
combination
is
the
combination.
indeed
says
this
court,
all
of
the
elements
are
not,
they
must
be
united
by
the
same
operation
of
law,
that
same
decision
repeated
in
the
companion
case.
i
would
like
the
court
at
this
point
to
consider
two
cases
which
appear
later
in
our
blue
brief
at
pages
33
and
34,
which
i
suggest
are
squarely
in
point
and
controlling
with
respect
to
the
law
of
this
court
on
the
infringement
of
combination
claims.
the
first
of
those
decisions
both
being
written
by
mr.
justice
hughes
is
the
case
of
woodward
v.
hurd,
the
second
seim
v.
hurd,
both
decided
in
1914.
now
these
two
cases
present
the
classic
situations,
as
decided
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
what
constitutes
direct
and
what
constitutes
contributory
infringement.
here
the
patented
device
was
again
a
three
element
combination,
a
rim,
a
wheel,
a
rim
of
the
wheel,
a
tyre
and
wires
which
tighten
the
rubber
tyre
in
the
rim.
the
two
cases
were
brought,
one
against
the
man
who
sold
all
the
parts,
and
the
other
against
the
man
who
bought
the
parts
and
assembled
them
for
the
first
time
and
woodward
--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
if
it
were
first
assembled
mr.
chief
justice,
and
then
disassembled,
the
first
assembly
would
concededly
constitute
an
infringement,
because
the
invention
would
be
made
within
the
united
states.
if
they
are
never
put
together
in
accordance
the
with
these
decisions,
we
are
considering
the
invention
is
never
made.
therefore,
any
subsequent
assembly
outside
of
the
country
results
in
no
invention
of
the
combination
claim
ever
being
made.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
that
is
correct
and
of
course,
we
differ
with
fifth
circuit
very
vigorously.
there
is
nothing
artificial
about
granting
a
patent,
and
then
restricting
the
patentee
to
the
claim
he
solicited
from
the
patent
office.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
no
i
do
not,
because
those
are
the
rules
of
our
game,
and
i
don't
think
they
are
artificial.
the
statute
says
makes,
that's
the
making
of
the
invention.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
well,
they
went
in
not
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
they
were
not
even
looked
at,
they
were
ignored.
they
really
didn't
look
at
the
statute
at
all,
they
based
their
decision
on
a
theory
of
economic
injustice.
but
where
as
we
ask
is
economic
injustice
involved?
where
that
which
is
being
done
is
right,
and
not
a
wrong.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
we
are
coming
to
that.
all
i
wanted
to
establish
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
what
the
law
was
in
this
court
and
i
think
it's
clear
and
there
is
no
dissenting
voice
in
any
decision
of
the
court.
now
when
we
get
to
the
policy
decisions,
several
of
them
have
been
set
forth
in
respondent's
brief
and
also
by
the
court
below.
in
the
first
place,
they
say
that
you
should
protect
a
foreign
market
for
a
domestic
patentee.
i
see
no
policy
that
requires
or
even
suggests
that
a
foreign
market
should
be
protected
by
a
domestic
patent,
that
patent
is
to
protect
the
patentee
in
the
united
states.
271(a)
clearly
says
that,
if
there
is
making,
using
or
selling
within
the
united
states,
it
doesn't
say
brazil.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
i
don't
think
--
i
think
they
are
exempt.
that's
the
very
point
of
the
argument.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
if
they
blew
--
you
mean,
if
they’re
assembled
in
the
united
states--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
yes.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
because
our
law
which
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
pointed
out,
if
it's
there,
we
have
to
content
with
it
or
reverse
it.
our
law
says
there
is
no
infringement
unless
it
is
made
within
the
united
states.
and
if
it
is
not,
then
there
is
no
wrong
to
be
enjoined.
that
i
think
is
the
answer
to
the
question.
now,
our
understanding
of
the
purpose
of
the
patent,
as
very
clearly
pointed
out
again
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
first
mercoid
decision
is
that
we
have
the
public
interest
being
paramount.
the
right
to
freely
compete
being
paramount.
and
the
only
thing
you
subtract
from
that
with
the
limited
monopoly,
that's
given
by
a
patent
for
a
very
limited
purpose
is
that
which
is
clearly
within
the
scope
of
the
grant
and
if
a
combination
claim
is
awarded
only
because
the
combination
is
the
invention,
there
is
no
infringement,
there
is
nothing
that
should
properly
be
taken
away
from
the
public,
when
that
combination
does
not
come
into
being,
within
the
united
states.
perhaps
--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
i
think
that
is
his
responsibility.
if
he
is
going
to
employ
the
economy
of
the
foreign
country
to
make
his
money,
if
he
is
going
to
do
his
merchandising
there,
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
the
difference
between
our
own
state
courts.
if
someone
is
going
to
come
in
and
use
the
economy
of
the
state,
they
should
go
to
that
state
court
for
their
redress,
i
think
the
same
is
true
in
the
foreign
country
and
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
well
there
is
no
reason
for
our
client
to
do
anything
in
the
absence
of
a
brazilian
patent.
now
there
is
a
brazilian
patent
and
these
parties
are
now
involved
in
litigation,
the
customer
that
brought
about
this
suit
here
is
involved
in
litigation
with
laitram
in
brazil
because
they
bought
the
parts.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
yes.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
there
is,
and
i
have
the
complaint
here
in
both
spanish
and
english,
i
cannot
read
the
spanish.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
well
not
necessarily,
because
shrimp
show
up
in
relatively
few
countries
around
the
world.
i
would
answer
you
yes,
whether
our
shrimp
yes,
but
that's
where
he
is
making
his
money.
and
i
see
no
fair
reason
why
he
shouldn't
be
expected
to
use
the
patent
system
in
the
courts
of
that
country
where
he
is
making
his
money,
in
order
to
protect
his
invention
there.
united
states
patents
by
definition
do
not
have
extraterritoriality.
now
there
are
some
statements
made
in
respondent's
brief
with
respect
to
copyrights.
if
the
court
will
examine
those
cases
you
will
find
that
there
are
two
copyrights
that's
in
appendix
a,
mr.
chief
justice.
copyrights
also
have
no
extraterritoriality.
the
reason
being
that
the
copyright
and
the
patent
arose
under
the
patent
clause
of
the
constitution.
trademarks
and
antitrust
prosecution
arose
under
the
commerce
clause
and
that's
a
whole
different
ball
game.
but
with
regard
to
both
patents
and
its
copyrights,
it's
clear
they
are
to
have
by
the
decisions
to
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts,
no
extraterritorial
effect.
now,
the
second
policy
consideration
raised
is
that
affirmance
of
court
below
would
prevent
evasion
of
combination
patents.
our
answer
to
that
is
that
under
the
law
of
this
court
and
the
law
that
has
existed
for
180
years
and
gone
through
a
codification
in
1952
reportedly
without
change,
there
is
no
evasion.
you
have
a
right
to
operate
outside
the
scope
of
claims
and
that's
all
that
petitioner
and
people
in
the
same
position
here
did.
it's
urged
that
there
is
discrimination
between
manufacturers
of
large
devices
and
small
devices.
the
manufacturer
of
the
small
device
has
every
opportunity
to
sell
his
device
in
parts
as
the
manufacturer
of
the
large
device.
and
notice
that
in
the
three
conflicting
cases,
in
the
second,
third
and
the
seventh
circuits
all
sorts
of
devices
are
involved.
in
andrea
where
the
decision
was
against
that
of
the
fifth
circuit,
a
radio
was
involved
and
it
was
a
question
of
of
whether
the
tools
could
or
could
not
be
put
in
with
or
without
infringement.
in
the
cold
metal
case
there
was
a
three-element
combination
again
of
rolls,
journals
and
bearings.
then
in
the
hewitt-robins
case
in
1965
and
1966
in
the
seventh
circuit,
there
was
a
huge
machine
involved
which
were
shipped
in
parts,
a
bridge,
a
reclaimer
wheel
and
supporting
structure.
but
the
small
man
has
every
bit
as
big
an
opportunity
to
send
his
equipment
overseas
unassembled
as
the
large
one.
then
the
point
is
raised
that
unless
the
court
below
is
affirmed,
there
will
be
a
multiplicity
of
lawsuits.
that
one
escapes
me
completely.
as
of
the
law
now,
with
the
three
conflicting
decisions
squarely
in
point
and
the
law
of
this
court
stating
that
there
is
no
infringement
of
a
combination
claim
without
assembling,
there
is
no
action
that
can
be
properly
brought
against
the
person
who
sells
only
the
parts.
if
the
fifth
circuit
is
affirmed
on
the
other
hand,
you
not
only
have
direct
infringement
against
the
manufacturer
of
the
parts,
you
have
direct
infringement
against
a
factor
who
goes
out
as
the
man
in
woodward
v.
hurd
did
and
buys
all
the
parts,
collects
them
together
and
resells
them.
and
then
you
will
have
an
action
for
contributory
infringement
against
every
vendor
who
supplies
a
part
that
isn't
a
stable
article
of
commerce
if
that
part
is
especially
adapted
to
go
into
the
combination.
so
as
far
as
litigation
is
concerned,
i
think
you
are
opening
pandora's
box.
there
will
be
a
great
multiplicity
of
lawsuits
resulting
from
an
affirmance
of
the
court
below.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
not
at
all.
if
the
box
was
shipped
outside
of
the
united
states
and
there
was
no
assembling.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
the
statute
is
specifically
designed
to
take
care
of
precisely
that.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
he
would
be
a
contributory
infringer
under
271
(c)
mr.
harold
j.
birch
it
would
not
be
a
--
but
the
same
remedy
would
lie
and
the
same
recovery
against
the
same
defendant
would
be
obtainable.
the
fact
that
you
are
calling
a
contributory
infringer
in
section
c.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
yes,
the
difference
between
direct
and
contributory
is
semantic
as
long
as
what
occurs
--.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
yes,
you
too
would
be
an
infringer.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
that
is
correct
but
as
has
been
pointed
out
in
respondent's
brief
there
is
a
rather
strong
policy
in
this
country
not
to
go
around
suing
and
the
courts
do
not
favor
suits
against
individuals
who
would
be
in
your
position
with
the
bruised
fingers.
but
--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
he
would
be
a
contributory.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
that
is
correct
and
he
could
be
sued
and
full
recovery
got
from
the
man
who
manufactured
and/or
sold
the
parts.
it
is
only
when
you
don't
assemble
in
the
united
states
that
this
question
comes
up.
and
as
the
andrea
case
had
said
this
really
isn't
the
technicality
that
it
is
accused
of
being,
because
no
wrong
is
done
and
no
wrong
is
done
because
no
infringement
occurs.
and
if
no
infringement
occurs,
no
liability
and
that
is
the
firm
policy
behind
those
three
decisions
and
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
backed
that
up
completely.
i
have
--
mr.
harold
j.
birch
deepsouth
has
one
very
small
factory.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
everything
that
is
sold
by
deepsouth
is
made
in
one
small
building
and
i
believe
there
is
a
total
workforce
of
four
or
five.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
individuals,
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
no
the
completed
device
is
not
put
together.
two
of
the
elements
are.
the
water
header,
the
trough
which
is
a
reciprocating
trough
in
the
deepsouth
design
are
put
together.
the
razor
blades,
the
long
blades
that
go
to
full
length
of
the
trough
are
always
supplied
separately,
perhaps
for
the
reasons
suggested
before
cut
fingers
and
the
like.
they
are
put
together
by
the
customer.
deepsouth
was
held
however
to
be
an
infringer
under
those
circumstances
and
laitram
has
full
recourse
against
them
under
that
decision
just
as
if
it
had
been
manufactured
entirely.
now
the
belt
conveyor
or
the
deveiner
has
in
fact,
always
been
manufactured
completely
by
deepsouth.
i
have
just
a
few
minutes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
them
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
brief
of
respondent
has
gone
at
great
lengths
and
the
same
argument
has
been
made
here
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
machine.
that
is
a
red
hearing.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
patented
invention.
i
think
that
was
made
clear
by
the
questions
from
the
bench.
you
don't
make
a
machine
with
an
invoice
or
a
letter
or
a
letter
of
credit,
you
make
it
with
nuts
and
bolts
and
wrenches
and
this
was
what
was
done
only
in
brazil.
now
there
is
no
total
emasculation
of
a
man's
rights,
if
he
doesn't
get
a
patent
which
covers
him
in
the
united
states,
whatever
it
is
he's
sold,
if
he
can
go
into
the
foreign
country
and
get
it,
he
is
protected.
again,
that's
where
he
makes
his
profit,
that's
where
his
market
is.
now
all
of
these
equitable
doctrines
of
doctrine
of
equivalence,
doctrine
of
negative
equivalence
and
the
like,
all
depend
upon
something
that
mr.
shoup
has
not
mentioned
and
that
is
the
making
of
an
invention
in
the
first
place.
unless
an
invention
is
made,
there
is
no
equivalent
to
worry
about.
the
point
here
is
that
an
invention
is
not
made
in
the
combination
sentence,
and
i
believe
it
is
most
material
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
brought
up,
that
if
the
law
is
that
you
must
assemble
the
combination
in
order
to
have
something
patentable,
you
must
reverse.
that
is
the
law
of
this
court.
it
is
no
subterfuge,
that
is
what
the
man
got
his
patent
for,
a
combination,
unless
the
defendant
makes
it,
there
is
no
infringement.
that
is
a
technicality,
that's
just
giving
the
man
what
he
has
coming
to
him.
mr.
harold
j.
birch
that
is
correct,
that
is
clear
from
aro
(ph).
unless
there
is
a
direct
infringement,
there
can
be
no
contributory
infringement
and
there
is
no
direct
infringement
as
we've
pointed
out
in
the
supreme
court
cases
before,
are
squarely
on
target,
it
didn't
correct
to
say
there
is
no
authority,
there
is
authority.
thank
you.
