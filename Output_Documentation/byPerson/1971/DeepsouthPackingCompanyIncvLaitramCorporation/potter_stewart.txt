justice
potter
stewart
could
i
get
a
patent
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
birch,
as
i
was
reading
the
briefs
in
this
case,
i
was
hearkened
back
to
the
earlier
days
of
my
fatherhood
when
i
used
to
spend
the
christmas
eve,
sometimes
a
ball
night
and
end
up
with
a
lot
of
bruised
thumbs
having
purchased
what
i
thought
was
a
coaster
wagon
and
come
in
a
box,
and
instead
of
a
coaster
wagon
there
will
be
a
lot
of
parts,
that
was
up
to
mother
and
father
to
assemble.
now
let's
assume
that
there
was
a
good
firm
patent
by
somebody
else
on
that
particular
kind
of
coaster
wagon,
would
your
argument
go
so
far
as
to
claim
that
the
big
box
of
disassembled
parts
to
be
put
together
at
home
by
the
buyer
that
that
would
not
be
an
infringing?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
might
be
infringing,
when
i
put
it
together,
but
how
about
the
person
who
sold
the
box
of
the
disassembled
parts
to
me?
justice
potter
stewart
he
would
be
a
contributory
infringer.
justice
potter
stewart
c,
but
he
would
not
be
an
infringer
in
your
submission,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
be
the
infringer
assuming
that
i
could
ever
get
the
thing
assembled
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
would
be
the
only
direct
infringer
on
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
seller
or
the
manufacturer
of
those
disassembled
parts
would
be
contributory
infringer
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
would
be
in
the
united
states
and
that's
the
only
difference
between
my
typical
case
and
yours.
justice
potter
stewart
does
deepsouth
have
in
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
that
it
assembled
in
that
factory,
all
of
these
devices
that
are
sold
in
the
united
states
market.
justice
potter
stewart
four
or
five
individuals?
justice
potter
stewart
but
for
the
united
states
market
the
three
elements
you
mentioned
are
assembled,
put
together
in
that
factory
for
all
sales
in
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it's
like
the
(inaudible),
if
we
come
over
here
and
copy,
go
back
and
make
it.
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
no
problem
with
equivalence
here,
do
we?
justice
potter
stewart
and
unless
somebody
makes
it
in
the
united
states
you
say
there
can
be
no
contributory
infringement.
