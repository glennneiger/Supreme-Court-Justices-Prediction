mr.
birch,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
you
are
stopped,
it
will
help
me,
if
you
would
explain
why
this
is
relevant
to
the
problem
of
assembly
versus
non-assembly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
all
clear.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
will
help
me
again
counsel,
if
you
would
tell
me
why
is
this
basic
problem
any
different
from
what
it
would
be,
if
it
were
a
typewriter
involved
with
the
same
issues
you
have
here
namely
the
assembly
problem
or
an
automobile
or
dishwasher?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt
you
right
there
but
would
it
make
any
difference,
if
it
were
not
assembled
for
the
first
time,
if
it
had
been
assembled
and
then
disassembled?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
thought
was
the
artificiality
in
part.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
see
no
artificiality
in
a
different
rule,
applied
to
a
situation
where
they
would
assemble
a
typewriter
or
the
washing
machine
to
see
if
it
would
function
and
run
it
through
quality
control
tests,
and
then
disassemble
it
and
go
through
the
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
guess
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
disagreed
with
you,
or
they
didn't
regard
this
as
a
matter
of
rules
of
the
game.
they
wanted
something
more
concrete
apparently.
chief

e.

you
may.
very
well,
mr.
birch.
mr.
shoup.
chief
justice
warren
e.

would
that
be
true
if
patent
had
been
obtained
on
the
same
machine
in
another
country?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
patent
had
been
obtained
in
brazil
or
whatever
other
countries,
would
your
conclusion
follow
or
were
you
just
addressing
yourself
to
the
coverage
of
the
united
states
patent?
chief
