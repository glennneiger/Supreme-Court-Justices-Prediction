justice

well
mr.
--
mr.
birch,
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
regarded
this
thing
as
a
subterfuge,
and
you
can
cite
20
cases
and
the
impression
remains
in
my
mind
that
it
still
is
a
subterfuge.
now,
granted
if
it's
a
subterfuge
permitted
by
law,
and
probably
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
reversed
but
it
seems
we’ve
got
to
address
ourself
more
than
you
do
to
the
justice
or
the
equity
of
it
rather
than
just
citing
a
bunch
of
cases.
