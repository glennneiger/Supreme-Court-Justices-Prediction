mr.
guy
w.
shoup
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
in
direct
answer
to
mr.
birch,
there
is
no
controlling
precedent
on
this
matter
before
the
court
at
all.
there
is
not
one
supreme
court
decision
that
relates
this
issue,
it
has
been
decided
since
this
country
was
organized.
this
is
the
first
time
it
has
come
to
this
court.
so
you
might
say
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
fifth
circuit
decision.
and
possibly
andrea
too.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
that
was
the
second
decision
in
the
radio
case.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
yes
the
fifth,
the
fifth
circuit
put
it
very
concisely
saying
that
the
district
judge
followed
the
second,
third
and
seventh
circuits
and
then
he
said
in
the
next
sentence
what
he
did
not
know
was
that
we
would
refuse
to
follow
and
went
on
from
there.
i
would
also
like
to
put
in
perspective
the
word
combination.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
there
is
no
supreme
court
case
on
that
particular
point,
your
honor.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
well,
there
are
cases
interpreting
combination
patents
but
always
in
terms
of
the
technical
question
of
whether
or
not
the
claim
for
the
patent
read
on
the
machine
and
operation
or
read
on
the
substance.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
well,
there
might
possibly
be
contributory
infringement
but
the
facts
of
this
case
are
fully
not
developed
to
answer
that
question.
271
(a)
says
whoever
makes,
uses,
or
sells.
now
what
is
it
that
is
made,
used,
or
sold?
let's
go
to
35,
to
section
101
of
the
patent
law
which
defines
patentable
invention.
patentable
invention
is
the
thing
that
the
person
can't
make,
use,
or
sell.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
well,
in
this
case
it
would
be
a
machine,
your
honor,
because
there
are
four
types
of
things
which
are
patentable
inventions
and
that
is
set
forth
not
in
any
of
the
parties
briefs
that
are
at
page
94
of
the
appendix,
the
statute
is
set
forth.
and
there
are
four
types
of
things
that
are
patentable;
machines,
manufactures,
compositions
of
matter,
and
processes.
here
we
are
talking
about
a
machine,
really
two
machines,
but
a
machine
and
in
this
case,
the
seller
calls
it
a
machine,
the
buyer
calls
it
a
machine,
the
foreign
government
calls
it
a
machine,
the
foreign
customers
private
bank
calls
it
a
machine,
the
united
states
private
bank
for
its
letter
of
credit
calls
it
a
machine,
a
machine.
so
i
submit
that
a
machine
has
been
made
and
sold
within
the
united
states.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
a
patentable
invention,
that's
correct
your
honor,
and
but
the
invention,
the
word
combination
does
not
appear
in
the
portion
of
the
patent
statute
that
defines
patentable
invention.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
if
they
had
never
been
put
forth
--
together.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
put
together
before.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
they
would,
if
the
man
had
in
his
mind,
the
idea
of
putting
--
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
no,
you
cannot.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
you
have
to
describe
a
cooperative
relationship
among
the
elements
in
order
to
obtain
the
patent.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
if
the
elements
are
old
or
new,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
got
to
describe
some
sort
of
relationship
at
any
time.
the
word
old
elements
is
almost
not
relevant
to
this
case
at
all.
let
me
go
to
something
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
said
when
he
inquired
about
foreign
patents
which
is
quite
relevant.
there
are
an
excess
of
100
jurisdictions
in
the
world
that
have
foreign
patents
and
when
a
man
has
an
idea
that
he
thinks
is
commercially
valuable,
a
clock
starts
running
against
them
and
that
clock
starts
at
different
times
in
different
parts
of
the
world.
for
example,
in
the
united
states,
he
puts
his
device
on
sale,
he
has
one
year
to
file.
somewhere,
in
some
other
country
in
world,
the
minute
he
has
to
file
before
he
tries
to
market
his
device.
so
in
the
united
states,
he
files
his
application
in
the
united
states
and
he
put
his
device
on
the
market
before
them,
he
is
precluded
from
getting
a
patent
in
the
foreign
country.
i
also
might
say
that
the
litigation
result
was
not
commenced
by
the
respondent,
it
was
commenced
by
the
customer
petitioner
and
the
extent
of
it
has
been
the
filling
of
a
complaint
and
there
was
no
summons
ever
served,
the
case
as
far
as
i
know
is
completely
defunct.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
no,
back
to
andrea,
in
andrea
2,
in
andrea
1,
a
statement
was
made,
“no
wrong
was
done
the
patentee
until
the
combination
is
formed.”
what
that
clerk
was
saying
is
that
the
patentee
did
not
have
a
cause
of
action.
they
were
stating
a
result
and
the
sentence
before
that,
that
says,
nor
is
this
so
highly
technical
as
it
might
seem,
seems
to
vindicate
it.
a
small
amount
of
defensiveness
on
the
part
of
the
court
in
handling
that
problem.
they
come
back
to
andrea
2,
they
put
the
tubes
in
the
radio.
they
pull
them
apart
and
the
court
says,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
parts
are
disconnected
at
the
time
of
sale
and
judge
swan
says,
aha,
we
have
overruled
andrea
1
because
we
don't
have
to
have
final
assembly
at
the
time
of
sale,
and
i
submit
that
judge
swan
viewed
andrea
2
correctly.
so
what
is
before
this
court
is
andrea
2
and
the
case
below.
let's
go
to
the
perhaps
most
difficult
case,
the
hewitt-robins
case,
the
last
case
that
considered
this
question,
the
ore
reclaimer,
the
patent
on
the
ore
reclaimer
issues
in
the
united
states.
i
go
to
the
patent
office,
i
see
the
patent,
it's
an
enormous
device.
if
i
go
to
a
manufacturer,
we
copy
the
exact
pictures
in
the
patent.
it's
a
huge
thing,
we
sell
it
to
the
man
in
turkey.
we
never
put
the
things
together.
we
just
copy
the
patent.
that's
the
result
of
hewitt-robins.
the
result
is
that
any
large
device,
or
any
device
at
all,
large
or
small,
can
be
copied
exactly
so
long
as
there
isn't
some
sort
of
an
evanescent
mechanical
connection
or
electrical
connection
within
the
confines
of
united
states.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
that's
right.
it's
perfectly
infringing.
i
think
in
hewitt-robins
however
there
were
two
or
three
points
involved.
one
of
them
was
domestic,
it's
probably
not
relevant.
now
as
to
the
economic
run,
section
284
of
the
patent
act
provides
for
monetary
recovery
when
someone
infringes
your
patent.
section
284
talks
in
terms
of
use
of
the
invention.
in
this
case,
use
of
the
patented
invention,
and
this
use
can
encompass
any
one
of
the
three
acts
of
making,
using,
or
selling.
so
the
patentee
is
entitled
to
a
monetary
recovery
regardless
of
whether
the
man
has
made,
used,
or
sold
the
invention.
those
acts
are
mutually
exclusive.
in
other
words,
you
don't
have
to
use
if
you
make,
you
don't
have
to
sell
if
you
make,
they
are
completely
exclusive
one
from
another.
and
the
economic
(inaudible)
is
the
inability
of
the
patentee
in
this
case
to
collect
from
the
person
that
has
infringed
his
patent
by
making
the
patented
machine.
back
to
andrea
2,
and
the
majority
opinion
which
says,
infringement
may
not
be
avoided
by
a
separation
or
division
of
courts
which
leaves
to
the
purchaser
a
simple
task
of
integration.
reflecting
on
andrea
1
which
allows
the
hypothetical
that
i
put
of
the
man
going
to
the
patent
office
and
copying
and
making
all
the
parts
in
the
united
states
selling
in
fob
in
new
york,
san
francisco,
new
orleans,
wherever,
and
off
they
go.
now,
to
answer
petitioner's
reply
brief,
they've
made
some
remarks
about
freedom
to
copy
right
up
to
the
extent
of
the
claims
of
a
patent
and
practically
every
time
a
patent
is
litigated
in
the
united
states,
the
scope
of
the
claims
is
at
issue
and
there
are
a
number
of
doctrines
that
operate
in
favor
of
the
patentee,
there
are
a
number
of
the
doctrines
that
operate
against
the
patentee,
when
these
claims
are
put
at
issue.
so
a
narrow
technical
construction
of
makes
or
sells
would
be
out
of
step
with
the
judicial
doctrine
that
is
has
developed
over
the
last
150
years.
examples
of
these,
and
they
all
occur
in
this
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
are
equivalence
which
allows
the
patentee
to
go,
it
doesn't
hold
them
to
the
exact
literal
words
of
this
claim.
two
examples,
one
of
which
was
--
both
of
which
were
asserted,
one
of
which
was
applied
in
this
case,
are
file-wrapper
estoppel
or
statements
he
makes
to
the
patent
office
restrict
him
within
the
literal
words
of
his
claim.
another
example
is
a
doctrine
called
negative
equivalence
even
where
the
claim
reads
right
on
the
machine,
the
patentee
has
to
prove
that
the
machine
is
even
more
an
exact
copy
than
the
claim
might
indicate.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
not
whatsoever,
but
i
was
merely
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
there
are
a
number
of
equitable
doctrines
that
have
developed
to
both
limit
and
expand
the
patentee's
rights
during
this
court
interpretation
of
the
patent
system,
and
the
fifth
circuit
correctly
realized,
i
submit
the
lack
of
necessity
for
a
legalistic
construction
of
the
word
makes
or
sells.
the
multiplicity
of
lawsuit
argument
that
mr.
birch
made,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
want
to
settle
all
disputes
between
the
two
parties
who
are
really
having
a
war
in
the
same
place,
if
at
all
possible.
mr.
birch's
suggestion
would
--
we
must
assume
that
the
patentee
is
going
to
try
and
sell
his
machine
wherever
there
is
a
market
for
it,
whether
it's
in
the
united
states,
brazil,
japan,
wherever,
under
the
result
we
urge,
this
dispute
can
be
resolved
in
the
united
states
court
and
the
patentee
is
not
forced
to
go
overseas
and
sue
its
customer
or
sue
his
perspective
customer.
it
could
be
settled,
let's
say,
in
one
forum.
in
this
case
--
in
this
situation,
the
result
that
we
urge
is
a
little
bit
analogous,
for
example,
to
the
blonder-tongue
case
a
year
or
so
ago
in
this
court
where
the
patentee
in
effect
cannot
go
around
the
united
states
and
bring
11
lawsuits
and
get
11
cracks
in
having
this
patent
help
valid.
the
affirmance
of
the
case
below,
the
decision
below
is
completely
concerned
with
the
u.s.
constitution
because
the
quid
pro
quo
in
the
patent
clause
of
the
constitution,
is
you
get
something
for
your
disclosure.
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
the
export
market,
you
get
nothing
for
your
disclosure.
if
this
court
reverses
the
court
below,
the
result
will
be
the
complete
exemption
of
exported
patentable
inventions
namely
machines
from
coverage
of
the
united
states
patent
or
stated
differently,
the
total
emasculation
of
the
united
states
patent
system
as
it's
applied
to
exported
machines
and
articles
of
manufacture.
now
regardless
of
where
those
articles
were
destined
for
in
any
--
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
excuse
me,
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
coverage
of
the
united
states
patent,
yes.
yes.
in
a
country
where
there
would
be
manufacturing
resources
present
and
there
might
be
a
manufacturing
competitor,
it
might
be
necessary
to
obtain
a
patent,
patent
in
terms
of
patent?
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
other
than
this
is
a
classic
case
of
the
substance
in
form
and
in
recent
decision
substance
is
a
preferred
victor
over
forms
and
form
should
not
triumphed
here.
thank
you.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
in
direct
answer
to
mr.
birch,
there
is
no
controlling
precedent
on
this
matter
before
the
court
at
all.
there
is
not
one
supreme
court
decision
that
relates
this
issue,
it
has
been
decided
since
this
country
was
organized.
this
is
the
first
time
it
has
come
to
this
court.
so
you
might
say
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
fifth
circuit
decision.
and
possibly
andrea
too.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
that
was
the
second
decision
in
the
radio
case.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
yes
the
fifth,
the
fifth
circuit
put
it
very
concisely
saying
that
the
district
judge
followed
the
second,
third
and
seventh
circuits
and
then
he
said
in
the
next
sentence
what
he
did
not
know
was
that
we
would
refuse
to
follow
and
went
on
from
there.
i
would
also
like
to
put
in
perspective
the
word
combination.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
there
is
no
supreme
court
case
on
that
particular
point,
your
honor.
mr.

mr.

w.

well,
there
might
possibly
be
contributory
infringement
but
the

of
this
case
are
fully
not
developed
to
answer
that
question.
271
(a)
says
whoever

now
what
is
it
that
is

have
foreign
patents
and
when
a
man
has
an
idea
that
he
thinks
is
commercially
valuable,
a
clock
starts
running
against
them
and
that
clock
starts
at
different
times
in
different
parts
of
the
world.
for
example,
in
the
united
states,
he
puts
his
device
on
sale,
he
has
one
year
to
file.
somewhere,
in
some
other
country
in
world,
the
minute
he
has
to
file
before
he
tries
to
market
his
device.
so
in
the
united
states,
he
files
his
application
in
the
united
states
and
he
put
his
device
on
the
market
before
them,
he
is
precluded
from
getting
a
patent
in
the
foreign
country.
i
also
might
say
that
the
litigation
result
was
not
commenced
by
the
respondent,
it
was
commenced
by
the
customer
petitioner
and
the
extent
of
it
has
been
the
filling
of
a
complaint
and
there
was
no
summons
ever
served,
the
case
as
far
as
i
know
is
completely
defunct.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
no,
back
to
andrea,
in
andrea
2,
in
andrea
1,
a
statement
was
made,
“no
wrong
was
done
the
patentee
until
the
combination
is
formed.”
what
that
clerk
was
saying
is
that
the
patentee
did
not
have
a
cause
of
action.
they
were
stating
a
result
and
the
sentence
before
that,
that
says,
nor
is
this
so
highly
technical
as
it
might
seem,
seems
to
vindicate
it.
a
small
amount
of
defensiveness
on
the
part
of
the
court
in
handling
that
problem.
they
come
back
to
andrea
2,
they
put
the
tubes
in
the
radio.
they
pull
them
apart
and
the
court
says,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
parts
are
disconnected
at
the
time
of
sale
and
judge
swan
says,
aha,
we
have
overruled
andrea
1
because
we
don't
have
to
have
final
assembly
at
the
time
of
sale,
and
i
submit
that
judge
swan
viewed
andrea
2
correctly.
so
what
is
before
this
court
is
andrea
2
and
the
case
below.
let's
go
to
the
perhaps
most
difficult
case,
the
hewitt-robins
case,
the
last
case
that
considered
this
question,
the
ore
reclaimer,
the
patent
on
the
ore
reclaimer
issues
in
the
united
states.
i
go
to
the
patent
office,
i
see
the
patent,
it's
an
enormous
device.
if
i
go
to
a
manufacturer,
we
copy
the
exact
pictures
in
the
patent.
it's
a
huge
thing,
we
sell
it
to
the
man
in
turkey.
we
never
put
the
things
together.
we
just
copy
the
patent.
that's
the
result
of
hewitt-robins.
the
result
is
that
any
large
device,
or
any
device
at
all,
large
or
small,
can
be
copied
exactly
so
long
as
there
isn't
some
sort
of
an
evanescent
mechanical
connection
or
electrical
connection
within
the
confines
of
united
states.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
that's
right.
it's
perfectly
infringing.
i
think
in
hewitt-robins
however
there
were
two
or
three
points
involved.
one
of
them
was
domestic,
it's
probably
not
relevant.
now
as
to
the
economic
run,
section
284
of
the
patent
act
provides
for
monetary
recovery
when
someone
infringes
your
patent.
section
284
talks
in
terms
of
use
of
the
invention.
in
this
case,
use
of
the
patented
invention,
and
this
use
can
encompass
any
one
of
the
three
acts
of
making,
using,
or
selling.
so
the
patentee
is
entitled
to
a
monetary
recovery
regardless
of
whether
the
man
has
made,
used,
or
sold
the
invention.
those
acts
are
mutually
exclusive.
in
other
words,
you
don't
have
to
use
if
you
make,
you
don't
have
to
sell
if
you
make,
they
are
completely
exclusive
one
from
another.
and
the
economic
(inaudible)
is
the
inability
of
the
patentee
in
this
case
to
collect
from
the
person
that
has
infringed
his
patent
by
making
the
patented
machine.
back
to
andrea
2,
and
the
majority
opinion
which
says,
infringement
may
not
be
avoided
by
a
separation
or
division
of
courts
which
leaves
to
the
purchaser
a
simple
task
of
integration.
reflecting
on
andrea
1
which
allows
the
hypothetical
that
i
put
of
the
man
going
to
the
patent
office
and
copying
and
making
all
the
parts
in
the
united
states
selling
in
fob
in
new
york,
san
francisco,
new
orleans,
wherever,
and
off
they
go.
now,
to
answer
petitioner's
reply
brief,
they've
made
some
remarks
about
freedom
to
copy
right
up
to
the
extent
of
the
claims
of
a
patent
and
practically
every
time
a
patent
is
litigated
in
the
united
states,
the
scope
of
the
claims
is
at
issue
and
there
are
a
number
of
doctrines
that
operate
in
favor
of
the
patentee,
there
are
a
number
of
the
doctrines
that
operate
against
the
patentee,
when
these
claims
are
put
at
issue.
so
a
narrow
technical
construction
of
makes
or
sells
would
be
out
of
step
with
the
judicial
doctrine
that
is
has
developed
over
the
last
150
years.
examples
of
these,
and
they
all
occur
in
this
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
are
equivalence
which
allows
the
patentee
to
go,
it
doesn't
hold
them
to
the
exact
literal
words
of
this
claim.
two
examples,
one
of
which
was
--
both
of
which
were
asserted,
one
of
which
was
applied
in
this
case,
are
file-wrapper
estoppel
or
statements
he
makes
to
the
patent
office
restrict
him
within
the
literal
words
of
his
claim.
another
example
is
a
doctrine
called
negative
equivalence
even
where
the
claim
reads
right
on
the
machine,
the
patentee
has
to
prove
that
the
machine
is
even
more
an
exact
copy
than
the
claim
might
indicate.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
not
whatsoever,
but
i
was
merely
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
there
are
a
number
of
equitable
doctrines
that
have
developed
to
both
limit
and
expand
the
patentee's
rights
during
this
court
interpretation
of
the
patent
system,
and
the
fifth
circuit
correctly
realized,
i
submit
the
lack
of
necessity
for
a
legalistic
construction
of
the
word
makes
or
sells.
the
multiplicity
of
lawsuit
argument
that
mr.
birch
made,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
want
to
settle
all
disputes
between
the
two
parties
who
are
really
having
a
war
in
the
same
place,
if
at
all
possible.
mr.
birch's
suggestion
would
--
we
must
assume
that
the
patentee
is
going
to
try
and
sell
his
machine
wherever
there
is
a
market
for
it,
whether
it's
in
the
united
states,
brazil,
japan,
wherever,
under
the
result
we
urge,
this
dispute
can
be
resolved
in
the
united
states
court
and
the
patentee
is
not
forced
to
go
overseas
and
sue
its
customer
or
sue
his
perspective
customer.
it
could
be
settled,
let's
say,
in
one
forum.
in
this
case
--
in
this
situation,
the
result
that
we
urge
is
a
little
bit
analogous,
for
example,
to
the
blonder-tongue
case
a
year
or
so
ago
in
this
court
where
the
patentee
in
effect
cannot
go
around
the
united
states
and
bring
11
lawsuits
and
get
11
cracks
in
having
this
patent
help
valid.
the
affirmance
of
the
case
below,
the
decision
below
is
completely
concerned
with
the
u.s.
constitution
because
the
quid
pro
quo
in
the
patent
clause
of
the
constitution,
is
you
get
something
for
your
disclosure.
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
the
export
market,
you
get
nothing
for
your
disclosure.
if
this
court
reverses
the
court
below,
the
result
will
be
the
complete
exemption
of
exported
patentable
inventions
namely
machines
from
coverage
of
the
united
states
patent
or
stated
differently,
the
total
emasculation
of
the
united
states
patent
system
as
it's
applied
to
exported
machines
and
articles
of
manufacture.
now
regardless
of
where
those
articles
were
destined
for
in
any
--
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
excuse
me,
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
guy
w.
shoup
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
coverage
of
the
united
states
patent,
yes.
yes.
in
a
country
where
there
would
be
manufacturing
resources
present
and
there
might
be
a
manufacturing
competitor,
it
might
be
necessary
to
obtain
a
patent,
patent
in
terms
of
patent?
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
other
than
this
is
a
classic
case
of
the
substance
in
form
and
in
recent
decision
substance
is
a
preferred
victor
over
forms
and
form
should
not
triumphed
here.
thank
you.
