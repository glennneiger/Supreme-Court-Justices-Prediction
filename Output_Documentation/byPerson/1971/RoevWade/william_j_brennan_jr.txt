justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
weddington,
the
issue
here,
i
guess,
on
your
appeal,
is
whether
you're
entitled
to
injunctive
relief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
assuming
that
in
all
other
respects
your
argument
were
accepted,
why
do
you
think,
in
addition
to
declaratory
relief,
you're
entitled
to
injunctive
relief?
those
are
different
things,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
a
dissent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
i
guess
we
said
that
in
zwickler
v.
koota,
didn't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
other
cases
say,
at
least,
that
federal
courts
may
in
limited
situation,
the
harassment
in
prosecution
improperly
is
used
as
a
device
to
harass
the
person
prosecuted.
now,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
it
ought
to
be
broader
than
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
we
were
talking
now
about—
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
are
talking
about
the
doctor’s
case
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
he
was
asking...
he
was
asking
what?
no
injunction
against
the
continuance
of
that
prosecution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
except
that
he
wanted
a
declaratory
judgment,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
underlying
statute
on
which
the
prosecution
was
brought
is
unconstitutional.
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
that's
what
samuels
and
mackles
said
he
couldn't
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
repeat.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
even
though
the—
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
then
i
come
back
again.
if
we're
left
only
with
the
lady's
action,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
declaratory
relief
they
already
obtained
was
not
enough,
because
that
doesn't
help
terminate
the
pregnancy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
the
answer
is
that
if
there's
a
prosecution
against
the
doctor,
there's
not
going
to
be
any
doctor
that's
going
to
be
available.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
we
do
that?
you
went
to
the
fifth
circuit,
because
we
said
that
you
couldn't
cross-appeal
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
you
could
only
cross-appeal
and
then
grant
or
denial
of
an
injunction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
we
could
do
it,
if
we
bypassed
the
court
of
appeals
and
bring
up
your
appeal
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
say,
your
position
makes
sense
to
me.
but
don't
some
of
our
prior
cases
rather
foreclose
it,
unless
we
bypass
the
fifth
circuit
and
bring
your
appeal
pending
right
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
didn't
file
any
motion
here
asking
us
to
bring
your
appeal
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit
here
for
decision
with
this
appeal,
did
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
floyd,
i
don't
find
that
thompson
case
cited
in
the
brief
here.
i
gather
you
said
it
just
had
been
decided
recently?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
a
citation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
provide
us
with
a
copy
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
date
of
it,
and
the
number?
do
you
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now,
that's
the
case
mrs.
weddington
told
me
was
pending
on
a
motion
for
rehearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
