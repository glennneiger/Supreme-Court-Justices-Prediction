mr.
robert
c.
flowers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
lower
court
in
dallas
has
held
the
texas
abortion
law
unconstitutional
primarily
on
the
two
grounds
that
had
just
been
discussed,
on
the
vagueness
question
and
the
rights
of
the
mother
under
the
ninth
amendment.
the
thrust
of
the
whole
argument
of
the
state
of
texas
is
against
the
rights
of
the
mother
under
the
ninth
amendment,
that
it
certainly
is
a
balancing
effect.
there
must
be
or,
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
texas
has
no
steak.
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
trace
within
my
allocated
time
the
development
of
the
fetus
from
the
date
of
conception
to
the
date
of
its
birth,
but
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
texas
that
upon
conception
we
have
a
human
baby,
a
person
within
the
concept
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
of
texas
also.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
your
honor,
we
feel
that
it
could
be
best
decided
by
a
legislature
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
can
bring
before
it,
in
medical
testimony,
the
actual
people
to
do
the
research,
but
we
do
have--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
from
a
constitutional
stand
point,
no,
sir.
i
think
it’s
fairly
squarely
before
this
court.
we
don’t
envy
the
court
for
having
to
make
this
decision.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
no,
sir.
we
can
only
go
back
to
what
the
framers
of
our
constitution
had
in
mind.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
no,
sir.
i
understand,
but
the
fifth
amendment--
i
know
the
fifth
amendment,
no
one
shall
be
deprived
of
rights
to
life,
liberty,
and
property
without
the
due
process
of
law.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i’m
not
sure
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
your
honor,
it’s
our
position
that
your
definition
of
a
person
is
so
basic.
it’s
so
fundamental
that
it
is--
the
framers
of
the
constitution
had
not
even
set
out
to
define.
we
can
only
go
to
what
the
teachings
at
the
time
that
the
constitution
was
framed.
we
have
numerous
listings
in
the
brief
by
mr.
joe
witherspoon,
a
professor
at
the
university
of
texas,
that
tries
to
trace
back
what
was
in
their
mind
when
they
had
the
person
concept
when
they
drew
up
the
constitution.
he
quoted
blackstone
in
1765
and
he
observed
in
his
commentaries
that
life,
this
right
is
inherent
by
nature
in
every
individual
and
exists
even
before
the
child
is
born.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
declaration
of
independence,
we
hold,
is--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
that’s
true,
your
honor,
but
what
my
point
there
was
to
see
the
thinking
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
from
the
people
they’ve
learned
from
and
the
general
attitude
of
the
time.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
think
that’s
true,
sir.
but
from
a
layman’s
stand
point,
medically
speaking,
we
would
say
that
at
the
moment
of
conception
from
the
chromosomes,
every
potential
that
anybody
in
this
room
has
is
present
from
the
moment
of
conception.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
on
the
7th
day,
i
think
that
the
heart,
in
some
form,
starts
beating.
on
the
20th
day,
practically
all
the
facilities
are
there
that
you
and
i
have,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
it
would,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
well,
there
would
be
the
balancing
of
the
two
lives
and
i
think
that--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
well,
in
this--
in
our
statutes,
the
state
did
choose
that
way,
your
honor.
well,
in
the
protection
of
the
mother.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
understand.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
wouldn’t
think
so.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
think.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
don’t
think
so,
sir,
and
there
is
another
thrust
of
our
argument.
if
we
declare,
as
the
appellees
in
this
case
have
asked
this
court
to
declare,
that
an
embryo
or
a
fetus
is
a
mass
of
protoplasm
similar
to
a
tumor
then,
of
course,
the
state
has
no
compelling
interest
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
as
far
as--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
because
this
is
the
only
type
of
operation
that
would
take
another
human
life.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
well,
there
again,
that
would
be
--
i
think
in
every
fate
that
a
doctor
performs,
that
he
is
constantly
making
this
judgment.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
would
think
so,
if
he
was
negligent.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
in
effect,
your
honor,
we
did.
in
the
statute
1195
that
has
been
very
carefully
avoided
all
though
out
these
proceedings,
it
is
not
attacked.
it
is
unconstitutional
for
some
reason.
if
you’ll
permit
me
to--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
no,
sir.
you
asked
the
question
about
whether
we
had
made
manslaughter--
abortion
manslaughter.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
well,
this
was
in
context
with--
this
is
1195.
they
are
attacking
1191
and
1196,
but
omitted
1195.
here’s
what
1195
said--
provides,
whoever
shall,
during
the
parturition
of
the
mother,
destroy
the
vitality
or
life
in
a
child
in
a
state
of
being
born
before
actual
birth
or/and
before
actually
birth
which
child
would
have
otherwise
been
born
alive
which
be--
shall
be
confined
in
the
penitentiary
for
life
or
not
less
than
five
years.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
sir?
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
would
think
that
it--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
it
would
be
immediately
before
childbirth
or
right
in
the
proximity
of
the
child
being
born.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
which
is
not--
would
not
be
an
abortion,
yes,
you’re
correct.
it
would
be
homicide.
and
we
feel
that
the
concept
of
fetus
being
in
the--
within
the
concept
of
a
person
within
the
framework
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
texas
constitution
is
an
extremely
fundamental
thing.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
your
honor--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
that’s
exactly
right.
we
feel
that
this
is
the
only
question
really
that
this
court
has
to
answer.
we
have--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
so.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
oh,
we
have
other
interests,
your
honor,
preventing
promiscuity,
maybe
that’s--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
balancing
against
he
ninth
amendment
rights
or
within
the--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
that’s
right,
they
do--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
that’s
right,
mutilating
and
castration.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir,
i
have
forgotten
about
those,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
would
assume
so,
sir.
anyone
with--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
no,
sir.
i
would
say
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
capability
of
mind
to
prove
the
merits
in
most
criminal
cases.
your
honor,
i’d
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
that
the
unborn
child,
if
this
court
has
not
been
blind
to
the
rights
of
the
unborn
child
in
the
past,
in
the
memorial
case
versus
anderson,
a
new
jersey
supreme
court
case,
the
court--
this
was
a
case
where
the
pregnant
woman
had
refused
on
religious
grounds
not
doing
a
blood
transfusion
and
in
order
to
save
the
child,
the
court
held
that
the
right
of
the
child
to
live
and
to
be
born
was
paramount
over
this
pregnant
woman’s
right
of
religion.
i
think
that
here
is
exactly
what
we’re
facing
in
this
case.
is
the
life
of
this
unborn
fetus
paramount
over
a
woman’s
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
she
shall
bear
a
child?
in
glickman
v.
cosgrove,
it’s
a
new
jersey
supreme
court
case.
it’s
a
tort
action
instituted
against
the
doctor
as
a
result
of
his
failure
to
warn
the
mother
that
she
was
suffering
from
german
measles
in
order
that
she
could
terminate
her
pregnancy.
the
court
recognized
the
life
of
the
embryo
and
stated
that
it
would’ve
been
easier
for
the
mother
and
less
expensive
for
the
father.
this
alleged
detriment
cannot
stand
against
the
contention
that
it’s
still
one
single
life.
in
jones
versus
state--
excuse
me,
jones
versus
jones,
a
new
york
supreme
court
held
that
the
unborn
child
was
a
patient--
the
mother’s
obstetrician
as
well
as
the
mother
herself--
excuse
me
a
minute.
in
jackson
versus
indiana,
this
court
zealously
guarded
the
rights
of
a
retarded
child.
now,
if
we
are
going
to
extend
the
right
of
a
child
who
has
reached
its
potential,
it
cannot
go
on
and
grow.
it
cannot
go
on
and
grow
mentally
and
achieve,
then
how
much
more
right
should
we
afford
to
a
child
who
is--
has
all
o
the
potential
of
achieving?
the
prince
versus
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
case,
this
court
was
faced
with
the
contention
that
the
state
statute
precluding
labor
by
child
in
tender
years
in
distributing
religious
tracks
was
protected,
that
the
child’s
right
to
grow
up
and
to
become
educated
and
fully
developed
was
paramount
to
these
parents’
religious
beliefs.
this
court
has
been
diligent
in
protecting
the
rights
of
the
minorities
and,
gentlemen,
we
say
that
this
is
a
minority,
a
silent
minority,
the
true
silent
minority.
who
is
speaking
for
these
children?
where
is
the
council
for
these
unborn
children,
whose
life
is
being
taken?
where
is
the
safeguard
of
the
right
to
trial
by
jury?
are
we
to
place
this
power
in
the
hands
of
a
mother,
in
a
doctor?
all
of
the
constitutional
rights,
if
this
person
has
the
person
concept,
what
would
keep
a
legislature
under
this
grounds
from
deciding
who
else
might
or
might
not
be
a
human
being,
or
might
not
be
a
person?
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
physical
act
of
being
born,
and
i’m
not
playing
it
down,
i
know
it’s
a
very
momentous
incident
but
what
changes?
is
it
a
non-human
in
changing
by
the
act
of
birth
into
a
human
or--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
well,
in
other
words,
it
has
been
the
theory
that
we
have
deriving
from
non-human
material
a
human
being
after
conception.
your
honor--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
court--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
wish
i
could
answer
that.
i
believe
that
the
court
must
take
these--
the
medical
research
and
apply
it
to
our
constitution
the
best
it
can.
i
said
i’m
without
envy
of
the
burden
that
the
court
has.
i
think
that,
possibly,
we
have
an
opportunity
to
make
one
of
the
worst
mistakes
here
that
we’ve
ever
made
on--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
sorry.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
only
that--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
sir,
in
this
case
you’re
talking
about?
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
in
answer
that
question
what
i
feel
to
believe
one
of
the
better
culminations
of
the
medical
research,
and
that
was
senior
judge’s
campbell’s
dissenting
opinion
in
the
doe
versus
scott
which
is
very
similar
to
the
case
we
have
before
us.
he
goes
in
chronological
order.
what
the
medical
research
has
determined
from
the
chromosome
structure
at
the
time
of
conception,
what
the
potential
is,
down
through
each
day
of
life
until
it’s
born.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
the
date
of
conception
until
the
day--
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
do
not
believe
that
i
could
give
that
to
you
without
researching
through
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case,
your
honor.
i’m
not
sure
that
i
can
give
it
to
you
after
research--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir,
he
did.
this
case
was--
the
court
held
there
that,
really,
the
problem
could
be
answered
on
an
extension
of
the
griswold
case
and
here’s
what
my
dissenting
judge
had
to
say
about
that
which
we
adopt,
your
honor.
he
said
that
“in
citing
griswold,
the
majority
concludes
we
could
not
distinguish
the
interest
asserted
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
from
those
asserted
in
griswold.
in
other
words,
in
their
views,
there
is
no
distinction
that
can
be
made
between
prohibiting
the
use
of
contraceptives
and
prohibiting
the
destruction
of
fetal
life
which,
as
explained
above,
may
reasonably
be
construed
to
be
a
human
life.
i
find
this
assertion
incredible.
contraceptive
prevents
creation
of
new
life.
abortion
destroys
existing
life.
abortion--
contraceptives
and
abortion
are
as
distinguishable
as
thoughts
and
dreams
are
distinguishable
from
a
reality.”
now--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
he
list
them
day
by
day,
just
prior
to
this
time,
sir.
but,
it’s
quite
lengthy.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
it’s
321
federal
supplement
on
page
394,
sir.
and,
i--
or
392,
it
begins,
your
honor,
and
i
refer
you
to
his
medical
condensation
because
i
read
most
of
the
comments
that
he
has
to
make
through
that--
these
many,
many
briefs
that
we
have
had
submitted
in
this
case
and
other
cases.
for
instance,
he
starts
off--
we
did--
see,
as
illinois
legislature
would
have
before
us,
the
following
undisputed
facts
relating
to
fetal
life,
seven
weeks
after
conception,
the
fertilized
egg
develops
into
a
well
proportioned
small-scaled
baby
and
then
goes
from
there
on.
now--
no,
he
doesn’t
address
himself,
your
honor,
to
the
moment
of
conception.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
you’re
entirely
right
there
and--
but
i
find
no
way
that
i
know
that
any
court
or
any
legislature
or
any
doctor
anywhere
can
say
that
here
is
the
dividing
line.
here
is
not
a
life
and
here
is
a
life
after
conception.
perhaps
it
would
be
better
left
to
our
legislators.
there,
they
have
the
facilities
to
have
some
type
of
medical
history
brought
before
them,
and
the
opinion
of
the
people
who
are
being
governed
by
this.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
that’s
right.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
your
honor,
the
massachusetts,
i
might
point
out--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
well,
if
there
would
be
exceptions
within
this--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
and
entirely
to
the
constitutional
perspective.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir,
it
is,
and
we
feel
that
the
treatment
that
the
courts
have
given
unborn
children
and
dissent
in
distribution
of
property
rights
by
the
court
below
have
all
pointed
out
that
they
have,
in
the
past,
have
given
credence
to
this
concept.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
i
would
think
possibly
that
that
would
indicate
that.
however,
your
honor,
in
this
whole
field
of
abortion
here
we
have,
on
the
one
hand,
a
great
clamoring
for
this
liberization
of
it.
perhaps
this
is
good.
population
explosion,
we
have
so
many
things
that
are
arriving
on
the
scene
the
last
few
years
that
might
have
some
effect
on
producing
this
type
of
legislature
rather
than
facing
the
facts
squarely.
i
don’t
think
anyone
has
faced
the
fact
in
making
the
decision
whether
this
is
a
life
in
a
person
concept.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
your
honor,
in
1854.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
do
not
think
it
was
an
offense,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
think
it
was
silent.
the
state
was
silent
then.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
well,
at
least
legislature
hadn’t
spoken
on
it,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
no,
sir.
the
state
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1845,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
when
it
was
a
republic?
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
it
was
passed
in
1854,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
think
it
was--
most
of
them
were
in
the
mid
1800s,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
no,
sir,
i
surely
don’t.
i’m
sorry.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i’m
sure
that
was
a
great
factor,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
also,
in
the
expiration
and
the
indian
days,
if
you
wish,
the
frontier
days,
i
don’t
imagine
that
too
many
abortions
were--
intentional
abortions
were
created
in
this
united
states.
people
were
such
a
necessity
to
develop
the
united
states.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
lower
court
in
dallas
has
held
the
texas
abortion
law
unconstitutional
primarily
on
the
two
grounds
that
had
just
been
discussed,
on
the
vagueness
question
and
the
rights
of
the
mother
under
the
ninth
amendment.
the
thrust
of
the
whole
argument
of
the
state
of
texas
is
against
the
rights
of
the
mother
under
the
ninth
amendment,
that
it
certainly
is
a
balancing
effect.
there
must
be
or,
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
texas
has
no
steak.
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
trace
within
my
allocated
time
the
development
of
the
fetus
from
the
date
of
conception
to
the
date
of
its
birth,
but
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
texas
that
upon
conception
we
have
a
human
baby,
a
person
within
the
concept
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
of
texas
also.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
your
honor,
we
feel
that
it
could
be
best
decided
by
a
legislature
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
can
bring
before
it,
in
medical
testimony,
the
actual
people
to
do
the
research,
but
we
do
have--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
from
a
constitutional
stand
point,
no,
sir.
i
think
it’s
fairly
squarely
before
this
court.
we
don’t
envy
the
court
for
having
to
make
this
decision.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
no,
sir.
we
can
only
go
back
to
what
the
framers
of
our
constitution
had
in
mind.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
no,
sir.
i
understand,
but
the
fifth
amendment--
i
know
the
fifth
amendment,
no
one
shall
be
deprived
of
rights
to
life,
liberty,
and
property
without
the
due
process
of
law.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i’m
not
sure
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
your
honor,
it’s
our
position
that
your
definition
of
a
person
is
so
basic.
it’s
so
fundamental
that
it
is--
the
framers
of
the
constitution
had
not
even
set
out
to
define.
we
can
only
go
to
what
the
teachings
at
the
time
that
the
constitution
was
framed.
we
have
numerous
listings
in
the
brief
by
mr.
joe
witherspoon,
a
professor
at
the
university
of
texas,
that
tries
to
trace
back
what
was
in
their
mind
when
they
had
the
person
concept
when
they
drew
up
the
constitution.
he
quoted
blackstone
in
1765
and
he
observed
in
his
commentaries
that
life,
this
right
is
inherent
by
nature
in
every
individual
and
exists
even
before
the
child
is
born.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
declaration
of
independence,
we
hold,
is--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
that’s
true,
your
honor,
but
what
my
point
there
was
to
see
the
thinking
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
from
the
people
they’ve
learned
from
and
the
general
attitude
of
the
time.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
think
that’s
true,
sir.
but
from
a
layman’s
stand
point,
medically
speaking,
we
would
say
that
at
the
moment
of
conception
from
the
chromosomes,
every
potential
that
anybody
in
this
room
has
is
present
from
the
moment
of
conception.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
on
the
7th
day,
i
think
that
the
heart,
in
some
form,
starts
beating.
on
the
20th
day,
practically
all
the
facilities
are
there
that
you
and
i
have,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
it
would,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
well,
there
would
be
the
balancing
of
the
two
lives
and
i
think
that--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
well,
in
this--
in
our
statutes,
the
state
did
choose
that
way,
your
honor.
well,
in
the
protection
of
the
mother.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
understand.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
wouldn’t
think
so.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
think.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
don’t
think
so,
sir,
and
there
is
another
thrust
of
our
argument.
if
we
declare,
as
the
appellees
in
this
case
have
asked
this
court
to
declare,
that
an
embryo
or
a
fetus
is
a
mass
of
protoplasm
similar
to
a
tumor
then,
of
course,
the
state
has
no
compelling
interest
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
as
far
as--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
because
this
is
the
only
type
of
operation
that
would
take
another
human
life.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
well,
there
again,
that
would
be
--
i
think
in
every
fate
that
a
doctor
performs,
that
he
is
constantly
making
this
judgment.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
would
think
so,
if
he
was
negligent.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
in
effect,
your
honor,
we
did.
in
the
statute
1195
that
has
been
very
carefully
avoided
all
though
out
these
proceedings,
it
is
not
attacked.
it
is
unconstitutional
for
some
reason.
if
you’ll
permit
me
to--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
no,
sir.
you
asked
the
question
about
whether
we
had
made
manslaughter--
abortion
manslaughter.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
well,
this
was
in
context
with--
this
is
1195.
they
are
attacking
1191
and
1196,
but
omitted
1195.
here’s
what
1195
said--
provides,
whoever
shall,
during
the
parturition
of
the
mother,
destroy
the
vitality
or
life
in
a
child
in
a
state
of
being
born
before
actual
birth
or/and
before
actually
birth
which
child
would
have
otherwise
been
born
alive
which
be--
shall
be
confined
in
the
penitentiary
for
life
or
not
less
than
five
years.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
sir?
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
would
think
that
it--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
it
would
be
immediately
before
childbirth
or
right
in
the
proximity
of
the
child
being
born.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
which
is
not--
would
not
be
an
abortion,
yes,
you’re
correct.
it
would
be
homicide.
and
we
feel
that
the
concept
of
fetus
being
in
the--
within
the
concept
of
a
person
within
the
framework
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
texas
constitution
is
an
extremely
fundamental
thing.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
your
honor--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
that’s
exactly
right.
we
feel
that
this
is
the
only
question
really
that
this
court
has
to
answer.
we
have--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
so.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
oh,
we
have
other
interests,
your
honor,
preventing
promiscuity,
maybe
that’s--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
balancing
against
he
ninth
amendment
rights
or
within
the--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
that’s
right,
they
do--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
that’s
right,
mutilating
and
castration.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir,
i
have
forgotten
about
those,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
would
assume
so,
sir.
anyone
with--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
no,
sir.
i
would
say
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
capability
of
mind
to
prove
the
merits
in
most
criminal
cases.
your
honor,
i’d
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
that
the
unborn
child,
if
this
court
has
not
been
blind
to
the
rights
of
the
unborn
child
in
the
past,
in
the
memorial
case
versus
anderson,
a
new
jersey
supreme
court
case,
the
court--
this
was
a
case
where
the
pregnant
woman
had
refused
on
religious
grounds
not
doing
a
blood
transfusion
and
in
order
to
save
the
child,
the
court
held
that
the
right
of
the
child
to
live
and
to
be
born
was
paramount
over
this
pregnant
woman’s
right
of
religion.
i
think
that
here
is
exactly
what
we’re
facing
in
this
case.
is
the
life
of
this
unborn
fetus
paramount
over
a
woman’s
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
she
shall
bear
a
child?
in
glickman
v.
cosgrove,
it’s
a
new
jersey
supreme
court
case.
it’s
a
tort
action
instituted
against
the
doctor
as
a
result
of
his
failure
to
warn
the
mother
that
she
was
suffering
from
german
measles
in
order
that
she
could
terminate
her
pregnancy.
the
court
recognized
the
life
of
the
embryo
and
stated
that
it
would’ve
been
easier
for
the
mother
and
less
expensive
for
the
father.
this
alleged
detriment
cannot
stand
against
the
contention
that
it’s
still
one
single
life.
in
jones
versus
state--
excuse
me,
jones
versus
jones,
a
new
york
supreme
court
held
that
the
unborn
child
was
a
patient--
the
mother’s
obstetrician
as
well
as
the
mother
herself--
excuse
me
a
minute.
in
jackson
versus
indiana,
this
court
zealously
guarded
the
rights
of
a
retarded
child.
now,
if
we
are
going
to
extend
the
right
of
a
child
who
has
reached
its
potential,
it
cannot
go
on
and
grow.
it
cannot
go
on
and
grow
mentally
and
achieve,
then
how
much
more
right
should
we
afford
to
a
child
who
is--
has
all
o
the
potential
of
achieving?
the
prince
versus
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
case,
this
court
was
faced
with
the
contention
that
the
state
statute
precluding
labor
by
child
in
tender
years
in
distributing
religious
tracks
was
protected,
that
the
child’s
right
to
grow
up
and
to
become
educated
and
fully
developed
was
paramount
to
these
parents’
religious
beliefs.
this
court
has
been
diligent
in
protecting
the
rights
of
the
minorities
and,
gentlemen,
we
say
that
this
is
a
minority,
a
silent
minority,
the
true
silent
minority.
who
is
speaking
for
these
children?
where
is
the
council
for
these
unborn
children,
whose
life
is
being
taken?
where
is
the
safeguard
of
the
right
to
trial
by
jury?
are
we
to
place
this
power
in
the
hands
of
a
mother,
in
a
doctor?
all
of
the
constitutional
rights,
if
this
person
has
the
person
concept,
what
would
keep
a
legislature
under
this
grounds
from
deciding
who
else
might
or
might
not
be
a
human
being,
or
might
not
be
a
person?
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
physical
act
of
being
born,
and
i’m
not
playing
it
down,
i
know
it’s
a
very
momentous
incident
but
what
changes?
is
it
a
non-human
in
changing
by
the
act
of
birth
into
a
human
or--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
well,
in
other
words,
it
has
been
the
theory
that
we
have
deriving
from
non-human
material
a
human
being
after
conception.
your
honor--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
court--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
wish
i
could
answer
that.
i
believe
that
the
court
must
take
these--
the
medical
research
and
apply
it
to
our
constitution
the
best
it
can.
i
said
i’m
without
envy
of
the
burden
that
the
court
has.
i
think
that,
possibly,
we
have
an
opportunity
to
make
one
of
the
worst
mistakes
here
that
we’ve
ever
made
on--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
sorry.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
only
that--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
sir,
in
this
case
you’re
talking
about?
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
in
answer
that
question
what
i
feel
to
believe
one
of
the
better
culminations
of
the
medical
research,
and
that
was
senior
judge’s
campbell’s
dissenting
opinion
in
the
doe
versus
scott
which
is
very
similar
to
the
case
we
have
before
us.
he
goes
in
chronological
order.
what
the
medical
research
has
determined
from
the
chromosome
structure
at
the
time
of
conception,
what
the
potential
is,
down
through
each
day
of
life
until
it’s
born.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
the
date
of
conception
until
the
day--
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
do
not
believe
that
i
could
give
that
to
you
without
researching
through
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case,
your
honor.
i’m
not
sure
that
i
can
give
it
to
you
after
research--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir,
he
did.
this
case
was--
the
court
held
there
that,
really,
the
problem
could
be
answered
on
an
extension
of
the
griswold
case
and
here’s
what
my
dissenting
judge
had
to
say
about
that
which
we
adopt,
your
honor.
he
said
that
“in
citing
griswold,
the
majority
concludes
we
could
not
distinguish
the
interest
asserted
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
from
those
asserted
in
griswold.
in
other
words,
in
their
views,
there
is
no
distinction
that
can
be
made
between
prohibiting
the
use
of
contraceptives
and
prohibiting
the
destruction
of
fetal
life
which,
as
explained
above,
may
reasonably
be
construed
to
be
a
human
life.
i
find
this
assertion
incredible.
contraceptive
prevents
creation
of
new
life.
abortion
destroys
existing
life.
abortion--
contraceptives
and
abortion
are
as
distinguishable
as
thoughts
and
dreams
are
distinguishable
from
a
reality.”
now--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
he
list
them
day
by
day,
just
prior
to
this
time,
sir.
but,
it’s
quite
lengthy.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
it’s
321
federal
supplement
on
page
394,
sir.
and,
i--
or
392,
it
begins,
your
honor,
and
i
refer
you
to
his
medical
condensation
because
i
read
most
of
the
comments
that
he
has
to
make
through
that--
these
many,
many
briefs
that
we
have
had
submitted
in
this
case
and
other
cases.
for
instance,
he
starts
off--
we
did--
see,
as
illinois
legislature
would
have
before
us,
the
following
undisputed
facts
relating
to
fetal
life,
seven
weeks
after
conception,
the
fertilized
egg
develops
into
a
well
proportioned
small-scaled
baby
and
then
goes
from
there
on.
now--
no,
he
doesn’t
address
himself,
your
honor,
to
the
moment
of
conception.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
you’re
entirely
right
there
and--
but
i
find
no
way
that
i
know
that
any
court
or
any
legislature
or
any
doctor
anywhere
can
say
that
here
is
the
dividing
line.
here
is
not
a
life
and
here
is
a
life
after
conception.
perhaps
it
would
be
better
left
to
our
legislators.
there,
they
have
the
facilities
to
have
some
type
of
medical
history
brought
before
them,
and
the
opinion
of
the
people
who
are
being
governed
by
this.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
that’s
right.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
your
honor,
the
massachusetts,
i
might
point
out--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
well,
if
there
would
be
exceptions
within
this--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
and
entirely
to
the
constitutional
perspective.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir,
it
is,
and
we
feel
that
the
treatment
that
the
courts
have
given
unborn
children
and
dissent
in
distribution
of
property
rights
by
the
court
below
have
all
pointed
out
that
they
have,
in
the
past,
have
given
credence
to
this
concept.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
i
would
think
possibly
that
that
would
indicate
that.
however,
your
honor,
in
this
whole
field
of
abortion
here
we
have,
on
the
one
hand,
a
great
clamoring
for
this
liberization
of
it.
perhaps
this
is
good.
population
explosion,
we
have
so
many
things
that
are
arriving
on
the
scene
the
last
few
years
that
might
have
some
effect
on
producing
this
type
of
legislature
rather
than
facing
the
facts
squarely.
i
don’t
think
anyone
has
faced
the
fact
in
making
the
decision
whether
this
is
a
life
in
a
person
concept.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
your
honor,
in
1854.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
do
not
think
it
was
an
offense,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
think
it
was
silent.
the
state
was
silent
then.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
well,
at
least
legislature
hadn’t
spoken
on
it,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
no,
sir.
the
state
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1845,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
when
it
was
a
republic?
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
it
was
passed
in
1854,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i
think
it
was--
most
of
them
were
in
the
mid
1800s,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
no,
sir,
i
surely
don’t.
i’m
sorry.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
i’m
sure
that
was
a
great
factor,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
flowers
also,
in
the
expiration
and
the
indian
days,
if
you
wish,
the
frontier
days,
i
don’t
imagine
that
too
many
abortions
were--
intentional
abortions
were
created
in
this
united
states.
people
were
such
a
necessity
to
develop
the
united
states.
thank
you.
