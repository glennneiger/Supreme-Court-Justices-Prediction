justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
of
course
mrs.
weddington,
you
make
many
additional
constitutional
attacks
upon
the
texas
statute,
and
only
one
was
before
us
in
the
vuitch
decision...
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
only
the
claim
of
unconstitutional
vagueness,
that
the
court
explicitly
didn't
reach
any
of
the
other
claims,
and
you
make
many
other
claims.
of
course,
before
you
get
to
any
of
those,
there
are
a
good
many
threshold
questions,
are
there
not,
of
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
could
they,
under
texas
law,
be
charged
as
accomplices
or
as
co-conspirators,
or
anything
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
three
plaintiffs
here
representing
a
class,
as
i
gather?
justice
potter
stewart
one,
an
unmarried
pregnant
woman;
two,
a
married
couple,
and
it
was
shown
that
it
would
be
injurious
to
the
wife's
health
to
have
a
child
and
also
injurious
to
her
health
to
use
the
most
efficient
form
of
birth
control;
and,
then
third,
is
a
physician
who
is
under
indictment,
or
was,
at
the
time
of
this
complaint.
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
weddington,
so
far
on
the
merits,
you've
told
us
about
the
important
impact
of
this
law,
and
you
made
a
very
eloquent
policy
argument
against
it.
and
i
trust
you
are
going
to
get
to
what
provisions
of
the
constitution
you
rely
on.
sometimes
in
the
court
--
we
would
like
to,
sometimes
but
we
cannot
here
be
involved
simply
with
matters
of
policy,
as
you
know
justice
potter
stewart
you're
relying,
in
this
branch
of
the
argument
simply
on
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
anything
else
that
might
be
applicable?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
asserted
state
interest?
is
there
any
legislative
history
about
this
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he's
going
to
defend
himself
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
isn't
he?
you
can
count
on
him
to
do
that.
justice
potter
stewart
"i
didn't
do
it."
or
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
has
this
defense
ever
been
interposed
in
a
texas
criminal
case
in
a
constitutional
defense?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
said
that
was
too
late?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
case
you
cited
to
the
chief
justice
earlier
in
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
basically
upheld
the
constitutional
validity.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
case
coming
to
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
texas
law
in
other
areas
of
the
law
give
rights
to
unborn
children
in
the
areas
of
trusts,
estates
and
wills,
or
any
of
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
class
action
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
surely
it
would
--
and
i
suppose,
we
can
almost
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
they
are
at
any
given
time,
unmarried
pregnant
females
in
the
state
of
texas.
justice
potter
stewart
couldn't
we
--
you're
here.
your
opponent
has
brought
a
direct
appeal
here,
because
your
opponent
was
denied
an
injunction
by
the
three
judge
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
not
bring
a
cross-appeal
here,
because
you
won,
from
the
point
of
view
of
successfully
resisting
the
injunction.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
that
you're
here
as
the
appellee,
you're
arguing
that
an
injunction
should
not
have
issued.
and
part
of
that
argument,
very
legitimately
convened
that
on
the
merits
the
court
was
wrong,
and
that
it
shouldn't
have
issued
a
declaratory
judgment
or
an
injunction.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
yet,
texas
does
not
attempt
to
punish
a
woman
who
herself
performs
an
abortion
on
herself.
justice
potter
stewart
but
we're
dealing
with
the
statute
as
it
is.
there's
no
state
there
that
equates
abortion
with
murder?
or
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
ordinary.
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
court
of
criminal
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
saying,
in
answer
to
my
brother
marshall's
question
as
to
what
is
the
interest
of
the
state
in
this
legislation
or,
even,
what
is
its
purpose,
its
societal
purpose,
your
answer
was,
i
think,
relying
on
your
opinion,
the
most
recent
opinion
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
texas,
it
was
the
protection
of
fetal
life?
and
i
think
you
also
said
that
that
was
not,
perhaps,
its
original
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
may
be
rather
important.
in
a
constitutional
case
of
this
kind,
it
becomes
quite
vital,
sometimes,
to
rather
precisely
identify
what
the
asserted
interest
of
the
state
is.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
that's
true.
policy
questions
are
for
legislative
and
executive
bodies,
both
in
the
state
and
federal
governments.
but
we
have
here
a
constitutional
question.
and,
in
deciding
it,
it's
important
to
know
what
the
asserted
interest
of
the
state
is
in
the
enactment
of
this
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
it
enacted?
justice
potter
stewart
it
goes
back...
justice
potter
stewart
...to
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century?
justice
potter
stewart
before
that
there
were
no
criminal
abortion
laws
in
texas?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
can't
quite
square
that
most
recent
pronouncement
with
the
earlier
decisions
of
the
texas
court,
that
refer
to
the
mother
as
the
victim.
can
you?
justice
potter
stewart
"are
constitutional"?
or
do
you
mean
laws
against
them
are
constitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
has
been?
justice
potter
stewart
texas
doesn't
grant
any
exemption
in
the
case
of
a
rape,
where
the
woman's
pregnancy
has
resulted
from
rape
--
either
statutory
or
otherwise-does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
such
a
woman
wouldn't
have
had
a
choice,
would
she?
justice
potter
stewart
regardless
of
the
purpose
for
which
the
statute
was
originally
enacted
or
the
purpose
which
keeps
it
on
the
books
in
texas
today,
you
would
agree,
i
suppose,
that
one
of
the
important
factors
that
has
to
be
considered
in
this
case
is
what
rights,
if
any,
does
the
unborn
fetus
have.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
it
were
established
that
an
unborn
fetus
is
a
person
within
the
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
you
would
have
almost
an
impossible
case
here,
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
you
certainly
would
because
you’d
have
the
same
kind
of
thing
you’d
have
to
say
that
this
would
be
the
equivalent
to
after
the
child
was
born.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
mother
thought
that
it
bothered
her
health
having
the
child
around,
she
could
have
it
killed.
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
how
should
we--
how
should
that
question
be
decided?
is
it
a
legal
question,
a
constitutional
question,
a
medical
question,
a
philosophical
question,
a
religious
question,
what
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
that
is
basically
a
medical
question?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
of
any
case
anywhere
that’s
held
that
an
unborn
fetus
is
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
here’s
what
the
framers
who
wrote
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
came
along.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
then
the
fourteenth
amendment
defines
a
person
as
somebody
who
is
born,
doesn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
it
does.
any
person
born
or
naturalized
in
the
united
states
doesn’t--
oh,
that’s
not
a
definition
of
a
person,
but
that’s
a
definition
of
a
citizen.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
an
offense
to
kill
a
child
in
the
process
of
childbirth.
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
if
you’re
right
about
that,
you
can
sit
down.
you’ve
won
your
case.
justice
potter
stewart
that
acceptance
of
ours
may
be
the
texas
abortion
law
presently
goes
to
far
in
allowing
abortion.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
generally
speaking,
i
think
you’d
agree
that
up
until
now
the
test
has
been
whether
or
not
somebody’s
been
born
or
not,
and
that’s
the
word
used
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
would
keep
a
legislature,
i
suppose,
from
classifying
people
who’ve
been
born
as
not
persons.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
been
the
theory
up
until
now
in
the
law.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
the
reason
i
asked
you
at
the
beginning.
what--
within
what
framework
should
this
question
be
decided?
should
it
be
a
theological
one,
a
philosophical
one,
or
a
medical
one,
or
are
we
confined
here
to
dealing
with--
justice
potter
stewart
the
constitutional
meaning
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you’re
right
that
an
unborn
is
a
person,
then
you
can’t
leave
it
to
the
legislature
to
play
fast
and
loose
without
dealing
with
that
person.
in
other
words,
if
you’re
correct
in
your
basic
submission
that
an
unborn
fetus
is
a
person,
then
abortion
law
such
as
that
which
new
york
has
is
grossly
unconstitutional,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
allowing
the
killing
of
people.
justice
potter
stewart
of
persons.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
can’t
leave
this
up
to
the
legislature.
there’s
a
constitutional
problem,
isn’t
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
basic
constitutional
question
initially
is
whether
or
not
an
unborn
fetus
is
a
person,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
critical
to
this
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
materials
indicate
that,
generally
speaking,
they’re
enacted
to
protect
the
health
and
lives
of
pregnant
women
because
of
the
danger
of
operative
procedures
generally
in
that
year
of
our
history.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
of
course
mrs.
weddington,
you
make
many
additional
constitutional
attacks
upon
the
texas
statute,
and
only
one
was
before
us
in
the
vuitch
decision...
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
only
the
claim
of
unconstitutional
vagueness,
that
the
court
explicitly
didn't
reach
any
of
the
other
claims,
and
you
make
many
other
claims.
of
course,
before
you
get
to
any
of
those,
there
are
a
good
many
threshold
questions,
are
there
not,
of
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
could
they,
under
texas
law,
be
charged
as
accomplices
or
as
co-conspirators,
or
anything
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
three
plaintiffs
here
representing
a
class,
as
i
gather?
justice
potter
stewart
one,
an
unmarried
pregnant
woman;
two,
a
married
couple,
and
it
was
shown
that
it
would
be
injurious
to
the
wife's
health
to
have
a
child
and
also
injurious
to
her
health
to
use
the
most
efficient
form
of
birth
control;
and,
then
third,
is
a
physician
who
is
under
indictment,
or
was,
at
the
time
of
this
complaint.
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
weddington,
so
far
on
the
merits,
you've
told
us
about
the
important
impact
of
this
law,
and
you
made
a
very
eloquent
policy
argument
against
it.
and
i
trust
you
are
going
to
get
to
what
provisions
of
the
constitution
you
rely
on.
sometimes
in
the
court
--
we
would
like
to,
sometimes
but
we
cannot
here
be
involved
simply
with
matters
of
policy,
as
you
know
justice
potter
stewart
you're
relying,
in
this
branch
of
the
argument
simply
on
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
anything
else
that
might
be
applicable?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
asserted
state
interest?
is
there
any
legislative
history
about
this
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he's
going
to
defend
himself
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
isn't
he?
you
can
count
on
him
to
do
that.
justice
potter
stewart
"i
didn't
do
it."
or
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
has
this
defense
ever
been
interposed
in
a
texas
criminal
case
in
a
constitutional
defense?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
said
that
was
too
late?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
case
you
cited
to
the
chief
justice
earlier
in
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
basically
upheld
the
constitutional
validity.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
case
coming
to
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
texas
law
in
other
areas
of
the
law
give
rights
to
unborn
children
in
the
areas
of
trusts,
estates
and
wills,
or
any
of
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
class
action
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
surely
it
would
--
and
i
suppose,
we
can
almost
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
they
are
at
any
given
time,
unmarried
pregnant
females
in
the
state
of
texas.
justice
potter
stewart
couldn't
we
--
you're
here.
your
opponent
has
brought
a
direct
appeal
here,
because
your
opponent
was
denied
an
injunction
by
the
three
judge
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
not
bring
a
cross-appeal
here,
because
you
won,
from
the
point
of
view
of
successfully
resisting
the
injunction.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
that
you're
here
as
the
appellee,
you're
arguing
that
an
injunction
should
not
have
issued.
and
part
of
that
argument,
very
legitimately
convened
that
on
the
merits
the
court
was
wrong,
and
that
it
shouldn't
have
issued
a
declaratory
judgment
or
an
injunction.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
yet,
texas
does
not
attempt
to
punish
a
woman
who
herself
performs
an
abortion
on
herself.
justice
potter
stewart
but
we're
dealing
with
the
statute
as
it
is.
there's
no
state
there
that
equates
abortion
with
murder?
or
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
ordinary.
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
court
of
criminal
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
saying,
in
answer
to
my
brother
marshall's
question
as
to
what
is
the
interest
of
the
state
in
this
legislation
or,
even,
what
is
its
purpose,
its
societal
purpose,
your
answer
was,
i
think,
relying
on
your
opinion,
the
most
recent
opinion
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
texas,
it
was
the
protection
of
fetal
life?
and
i
think
you
also
said
that
that
was
not,
perhaps,
its
original
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
may
be
rather
important.
in
a
constitutional
case
of
this
kind,
it
becomes
quite
vital,
sometimes,
to
rather
precisely
identify
what
the
asserted
interest
of
the
state
is.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
that's
true.
policy
questions
are
for
legislative
and
executive
bodies,
both
in
the
state
and
federal
governments.
but
we
have
here
a
constitutional
question.
and,
in
deciding
it,
it's
important
to
know
what
the
asserted
interest
of
the
state
is
in
the
enactment
of
this
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
it
enacted?
justice
potter
stewart
it
goes
back...
justice
potter
stewart
...to
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century?
justice
potter
stewart
before
that
there
were
no
criminal
abortion
laws
in
texas?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
can't
quite
square
that
most
recent
pronouncement
with
the
earlier
decisions
of
the
texas
court,
that
refer
to
the
mother
as
the
victim.
can
you?
justice
potter
stewart
"are
constitutional"?
or
do
you
mean
laws
against
them
are
constitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
has
been?
justice
potter
stewart
texas
doesn't
grant
any
exemption
in
the
case
of
a
rape,
where
the
woman's
pregnancy
has
resulted
from
rape
--
either
statutory
or
otherwise-does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
such
a
woman
wouldn't
have
had
a
choice,
would
she?
justice
potter
stewart
regardless
of
the
purpose
for
which
the
statute
was
originally
enacted
or
the
purpose
which
keeps
it
on
the
books
in
texas
today,
you
would
agree,
i
suppose,
that
one
of
the
important
factors
that
has
to
be
considered
in
this
case
is
what
rights,
if
any,
does
the
unborn
fetus
have.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
it
were
established
that
an
unborn
fetus
is
a
person
within
the
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
you
would
have
almost
an
impossible
case
here,
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
you
certainly
would
because
you’d
have
the
same
kind
of
thing
you’d
have
to
say
that
this
would
be
the
equivalent
to
after
the
child
was
born.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
mother
thought
that
it
bothered
her
health
having
the
child
around,
she
could
have
it
killed.
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
how
should
we--
how
should
that
question
be
decided?
is
it
a
legal
question,
a
constitutional
question,
a
medical
question,
a
philosophical
question,
a
religious
question,
what
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
that
is
basically
a
medical
question?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
of
any
case
anywhere
that’s
held
that
an
unborn
fetus
is
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
here’s
what
the
framers
who
wrote
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
came
along.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
then
the
fourteenth
amendment
defines
a
person
as
somebody
who
is
born,
doesn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
it
does.
any
person
born
or
naturalized
in
the
united
states
doesn’t--
oh,
that’s
not
a
definition
of
a
person,
but
that’s
a
definition
of
a
citizen.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
an
offense
to
kill
a
child
in
the
process
of
childbirth.
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
if
you’re
right
about
that,
you
can
sit
down.
you’ve
won
your
case.
justice
potter
stewart
that
acceptance
of
ours
may
be
the
texas
abortion
law
presently
goes
to
far
in
allowing
abortion.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
generally
speaking,
i
think
you’d
agree
that
up
until
now
the
test
has
been
whether
or
not
somebody’s
been
born
or
not,
and
that’s
the
word
used
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
would
keep
a
legislature,
i
suppose,
from
classifying
people
who’ve
been
born
as
not
persons.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
been
the
theory
up
until
now
in
the
law.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
the
reason
i
asked
you
at
the
beginning.
what--
within
what
framework
should
this
question
be
decided?
should
it
be
a
theological
one,
a
philosophical
one,
or
a
medical
one,
or
are
we
confined
here
to
dealing
with--
justice
potter
stewart
the
constitutional
meaning
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you’re
right
that
an
unborn
is
a
person,
then
you
can’t
leave
it
to
the
legislature
to
play
fast
and
loose
without
dealing
with
that
person.
in
other
words,
if
you’re
correct
in
your
basic
submission
that
an
unborn
fetus
is
a
person,
then
abortion
law
such
as
that
which
new
york
has
is
grossly
unconstitutional,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
allowing
the
killing
of
people.
justice
potter
stewart
of
persons.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
can’t
leave
this
up
to
the
legislature.
there’s
a
constitutional
problem,
isn’t
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
basic
constitutional
question
initially
is
whether
or
not
an
unborn
fetus
is
a
person,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
critical
to
this
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
materials
indicate
that,
generally
speaking,
they’re
enacted
to
protect
the
health
and
lives
of
pregnant
women
because
of
the
danger
of
operative
procedures
generally
in
that
year
of
our
history.
