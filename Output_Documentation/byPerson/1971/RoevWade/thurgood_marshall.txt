couldn't
the
doctor
raise
the
same
point
in
the
criminal
prosecution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
want
to
talk
about
the
doctor.
you
said
there
were
two
separate
issues
here.
and
the
issue
involving
the
doctor,
he
could
litigate
everything
he's
now
litigating
in
the
state
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
texas'
interest?
what
is
texas'
interest
in
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
texas
statute
covers
the
entire
period
of
pregnancy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
first
few
weeks
of
pregnancy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
first
few
weeks
of
pregnancy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
make
no
distinctions
whether
there's
life
there
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
do
you
have
any
scientific
data
to
support
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
six
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
statute
goes
all
the
way
back
to
one
hour?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
appreciate
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
withdraw
the
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
the
state
of
texas
say
that
if
it’s
for
the
benefit
of
the
health
of
the
wife,
they
can
kill
the
husband?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
texas
say,
if
it
comes
to
a
situation
for
the
benefit
and
the
health
of
the
wife
that
the
husband
has
to
die,
could
they
kill
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
statute
in
texas
that
prohibits
doctors
from
performing
any
operation
other
than
an
abortion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
no--
the
only
operation
that
a
doctor
could
possibly
commit
that
will
bring
on
the
criminal
penalty
is
the
abortion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
don’t
you
limit
some
other
operation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
a
brain
operation
could.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
a
doctor
performs
a
brain
operation
and
does
it
improperly,
he
could
be
guilty
of
manslaughter,
couldn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
couldn’t
you
charge
him
with
manslaughter
if
he
commits
an
abortion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
initiated?
justice
thurgood
marshall
maybe
the
reason
is
why
have
two
concepts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
that
statute
mean?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
it
mean?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which,
is
not
an
abortion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
apply
to
doctors?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
case
that
says
so?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there’s
no
medical
testimony--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
backs
up
your
statement
that
it
goes
from
inception,
is
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
medical?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
is
there
any
medical
testimony
of
any
kind
that
says
that
a
fetus
is
a
person
at
the
time
of
inception?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
understood
you
to
say
the
state
of
texas
says
it
extends
from
the
date
of
inception
until
the
child
is
born.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
you’re
not
quoting
a
judge.
i
want
you
to
give
me
a
medical
recognizable
medical
writing
of
any
kind
that
says
that
at
the
time
of
conception
that
the
fetus
is
a
person.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
are
the
medical
part,
as
you
told
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
he
cited,
are
they
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
you’re
reading
from?
justice
thurgood

i
didn’t
think
so.
