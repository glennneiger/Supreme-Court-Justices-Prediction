justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
that
mean
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
getting
a
declaratory
judgment
under
texas
law?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
in
any
event,
mr.
floyd,
apart
from
your
personal
attitude,
your
court
has
spoken
on
the
intent
of
the
statute,
has
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
weddington,
you’re
attacking
the
statute
on
two
grounds,
are
you
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
both
vagueness
and
the
ninth
amendment.
do
you
place
any
greater
weight
on
one
argument
as
against
the
other?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that’s
the
recent
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
again
up
on
vagueness.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i’ll
go
back
to
my
question.
are
you--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
you’re
relying
on
both.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
referred
a
little
bit
to
history.
let
me
ask
you
a
question
based
on
history.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you’re
familiar
with
a
hippocratic
oath?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
think
i
may
have
missed
it,
but
i
find
no
reference
to
it
in
this--
in
your
brief
or
in
the
luminous
briefs
that
were
overwhelmed
with
here.
you
have
any
comment
about
the
hippocratic
oath?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
are
other
briefs
in
the
other
side
joined
by
equally
outstanding
positions.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
tell
me
why
you
didn’t
discuss
the
hippocratic
oath.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
it’s
the
only
definitive
statement
of
ethics
in
the
medical
profession.
i
take
it,
from
what
you
just
said,
that
you’re--
you
didn’t
even
footnote
it
because
it’s
old.
that’s
about
really
what
you’re
saying.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
another
question.
last
june
29,
this
court
decided
the
capital
punishment
cases.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
feel
that
there
is
any
inconsistency
in
the
court’s
decision
in
those
cases
outlying
the
death
penalty
with
respect
to
convicted
murderers
and
rapists
at
one
end
of
lifespan,
and
your
position
in
this
case
at
the
other
end
of
lifespan?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
do
i
get
from
this
then
that
your
case
depends
primarily
on
the
proposition
that
the
fetus
has
no
constitutional
rights?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
when
you
quote
blackstone,
is
it
not
true
that
in
blackstone’s
time
abortion
was
not
a
felony?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
think--
i’m
just
wondering
if
there’s
a
basic
consistency
there
and
let
me
go
back
to
something
else
that
you
said.
is
it
not
true
or
is
it
true
that
the
medical
profession
itself
is
not
in
agreement
as
to
when
life
begins?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
you’re
speaking
of
potential
of
life.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
with
which
everyone
can
agree
perhaps.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
flowers,
when
was
the
first
abortion
statute
adopted
in
your
state?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
prior
to
1854,
what
was
the
situation
in
texas?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
in
your--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
in
your
theory,
destruction
of
a
person
in
the
form
of
a
fetus
was
legal.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
was
legal.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
know
as
a
matter
of
historical
fact
when
most
of
these
abortion
statutes
came
on
the
books?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
fact,
the
latter
half
of
the
19th
century.
do
you
know
why
they
okayed
him
on
at
that
time?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
hippocratic
oath
went
directly
and
specifically
to
abort
the
procedures.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
whatever--
however
life
was
defined.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
to
make
sure
i
get
your
argument
in
focus,
i
take
it
from
your
recent
remarks
that
you
are
urging
upon
us
abortion
on
demand
that
the
woman
alone,
not
in
conjunction
with
her
physician.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
doesn’t
it
follow
from
that
then
that
one
can
come
into
a
doctor’s
office
and
say
“i
want
an
abortion”?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
then
what
does
she
do?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
that
mean
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
getting
a
declaratory
judgment
