when
this
case
was
in
the
district
court,
the
case
of
vuitch
against
the
united
states
had
not
been
decided
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
do
you
think
that

off
some
of
the
questions
raised
now?
chief

e.
burger
the

roe
against

mrs.
weddington,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
prosecutions
of
doctors,
you’re
speaking
of.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
“meaningful.”
you
meant
meaningless,
didn’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
meaningless
review.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
make
any
distinction
between
the
first
month
and
the
ninth
month
of
gestation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you,
in
your
position
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it’s
the
weighing
process
that
mr.
justice
white
was
referring
to.
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
texas
constitutionally--
did
you
want
to
respond
further
to
justice
stewart?
did
you
want
to
respond
further
to
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
texas
constitutionally,
in
your
view,
declare
that—by
statute
that
the
fetus
is
a
person
for
all
constitutional
purposes
after
the
third
month
of
gestation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
states
have
to--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
against
the
statutes,
don’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
have
been
recognized
in
the
period
before
birth
for
purposes
of
injury
claims.
you
put
that,
i
take
it,
in
the
property
category?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
flowers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
texas
have
judicial
statutes
on
mutilation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
guess
in
the
criminal
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
if
there
are,
there
are--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
certain
procedures
which
could
be
criminal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
man
walked
into
the
doctor’s
office
and
said
i
want
you
to
cutoff
my
right
arm--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
it
has
offended
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
it
historically
pretty
well
accepted
as
a
fact
that
in
the
early
period
in
the
history
of
this
country,
there
was
general
reliance
upon
religious
discipline
to
preclude
this
kind
of
activity,
abortions,
and
when
that
didn’t
seem
to
cover
it,
then
the
states
began
to
enact
statutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
have
been
done
in
england.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
weddington,
you
have
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
this
court
say
about
vagueness
in
the
vuitch
case?
what
did
we
say
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
isn’t
the
only
difference
between
the
texas
statute
and
the
d.c.
statute
that
the
texas
statute
does
not
have
the
health
factor
in
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
under
vuitch,
unless
the
court
was
prepared
to
overrule
it,
nullified
the
texas
statute
would
be
valid
if
it
was
construed
to
include
abortions
for
the
protection
of
health--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
treating
life
as
broad
enough
to--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
include
health.
chief

the

e.

you
said
“meaningful.”
you
meant
meaningless,
didn’t
you?
chief

e.

meaningless
review.
chief

do
you
make

do

could

declare

yes,

states
have
to--

they?
chief

warren
e.

they

you
put

i
take
it,
in
the
property
category?
chief

warren
e.

mr.
flowers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
texas
have
judicial
statutes
on
mutilation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
guess
in
the
criminal
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
if
there
are,
there
are--
chief

warren
e.

certain
procedures
which
could

criminal.
chief

what
