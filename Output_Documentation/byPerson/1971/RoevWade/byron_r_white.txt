well,
do
you
make
any
distinctions?
justice

what's
your
constitutional
position
here?
justice

white
what
about
whatever
clause
of
the
constitution
you
rest
on-ninth
amendment,
due
process,
the

will
that
take
you

why?
why
is
that?
justice

emotional
response
by

justice
byron

white
well,
do
you
or
don't
you
say
that
the
constitutional
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
you
insist
on
reaches
up
to
the
time
of
birth?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
asserting
that
the
pregnant
woman
has
standing
in
this
case,
and
the
married
couple
where
the
wife
is
not
pregnant
has
standing
justice
byron

white
but
what
about
the
doctor
where
a
criminal
prosecution
is
already
pending
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
was
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
younger
and
its
companion
cases
cover
declaratory
judgments?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
one
pending.
justice
byron

white
what
about
the
unborn
child
who
as
a
result
of
an
accident,
killed
or
whatever
word
you
want
to
use
for
it?
justice

well,
what
about
around

justice
byron

white
for
either
the

justice
byron

white
what
about

recovering
on

death
of
the

or
for
the
whatever
you
want
to
call

justice
byron

only
for

justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
include
anything
with
regard
to
the

justice
byron

white
there's
a
big
difference.
colorado
had
amended
its
statute,
and
texas
had
not.
justice
byron

white
but,
two
months.
but
it
was
the
other
statute
that
had
been
the
subject
of
the
litigation.
and
that
statute
had
been
amended
in
hall
against
beals.
that
is
not
true
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
suggest,
if
you're
right,
what
procedure
would
you
suggest
for
any
pregnant
female
in
the
state
of
texas
ever
to
get
any
judicial
consideration
of
this
constitutional
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
she
makes
her
choice
when
she
decides
to
live
in
texas.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
sustaining
or
are
you
saying
that
the
denial
of
injunction
was
proper,
because
the
declaratory
judgment
was
in
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
but
certainly,
if
the
judgment
about
the
-
if
the
declaratory
judgment
was
erroneous,
it
was
also
right
to
deny
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
cross-appeal?
you
could
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
are
you
attempting
to
sustain
the
denial
of
injunction
here
on
the
grounds
that
the
declaratory
judgment
was
improper?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
also
critical
to
your
case
that
the
fetus
not
to
be
a
person
under
the
due
process
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
how
about
the
fetus?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i’m
just
asking
you,
under
the
federal
constitution,
is
the
fetus
a
person
for
the
purpose
of
the
protection
of
the
due
process
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if--
would
you
loose
your
case
if
the
fetus
was
a
person?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you’d
still--
you
have
any
way,
don’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
any
way,
don’t
you?
you’re
going
to
be
balancing
the
rights
of
the
mother
against
the
rights
of
the
fetus.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
a
state
interest,
if
it’s
only
a
statutory
interest
or
a
constitutional
interest
under
the
state
law,
can
never
outweigh
a
federal
constitutional
right,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
all
the
talk
of
compelling
state
interests
is
beside
the
point.
it
can
never
be
compelling
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that’s
what’s
involved
in
this
case,
weighing
one’s
life
against
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you’re
correct
that
the
fetus
is
a
person,
then
i
don’t
suppose
you’d
have
a--
the
state
would
have
great
trouble
permitting
an
abortion,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
circumstance.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
save
the
life
of
the
mother
or
her
health
or
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
choose?
would
you
choose
to
kill
the
innocent
one
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
case
is
over
for
you?
you’ve
lost
your
case
if
the
fetus
or
the
embryo
is
not
a
person,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
state
has
no
interest
that--
of
its
own
that
it
can
assert
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
your
legislature
apparently
or
you’re
asserting
that
the
state--
that
your
state
law
wants
to
protect
the
life
of
the
fetus.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under
state
law,
there
is
some
rights
given--
there
are
some
rights
given
to
the
fetus.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you’re
asserting
those
rights
against
the
right
of
the
mother.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that’s
wholly
aside
from
whether
or
not
the
fetus
is
a
person
under
the
federal
constitution.
you
can
still
assert
those
rights
whether
the
fetus
is
a
person
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
your
argument
is
that
state
may
not
protect
the
life
of
the
fetus
or
with
that
of
abortion
even
at
any
time
during
pregnancy.
justice
byron
r.
white
right
up
until
the
moment
of
birth.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
your
argument,
as
the
way
you
state
it,
is
that
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
what
part
of
pregnancy
that
the
state
would
cut
the
abortion.
it
will
still
be
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don’t
know
whether
it
is
or
it
isn’t.
if
the
statute
you’re
claiming
is
a
statute
that’s
void
on
its
face.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
it
possible
the
statute--
before
you
can
declare
the
statute
void
on
its
face
that
you
have
to
say
that
it’s
void
no
matter
when
in
the
pregnancy
the
abortion
takes
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
statute
void
on
the--
could
the
statute
be
void
on
its
face
if
the
state
could
prevent
abortions
at
any
time
after
six
months?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
let’s
assume
that
it’s
unconstitutional
for
the
state
to
prevent
abortion
after
six
months.
justice
byron

white
this
is
a
free

clause.
the
statute
might
be
perfectly
valid

and

you’re
saying--
justice

it’s
invalid
on

totally
invalid.
justice
byron

it
may
not

it
may
not
be
enough
in
preventing

no

when

justice
byron

i

would
