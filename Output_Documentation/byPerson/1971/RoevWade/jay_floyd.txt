mr.
jay
floyd
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
an
old
joke,
but
when
a
man
argues
against
two
beautiful
ladies
like
this,
they
are
going
to
have
the
last
word.
before
i
proceed
to
the
original
issue
in
this
case-which
was
the
propriety
of
the
trial
court
grant,
or
denying
of
injunctive
relief
-
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
some
grave
matters
concerning
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
standing
of
the
parties.
the
couple
involved:
they
were
a
married
couple,
childless
married
couple.
the
only
matter,
evidence,
or
whatever,
in
the
record
concerning
their
contentions
is
contained
in
their
first
amended
original
petition.
that
is,
that
the
woman
would
have
difficulty
if
she
became
pregnant
in
carrying
a
child
to
childbirth.
further,
that
they
were
unprepared
for
parenthood.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
their
cause
of
action
is
strictly
based
upon
conjecture.
will
they
continue
the
marriage?
will
her
health
improve?
will
they
then
be,
at
some
time
in
the
future,
prepared
or
unprepared
for
parenthood?
there
is
no
fear
of
prosecution
by
mary
doe.
if
we
accept
all
contentions
of
this
married
couple,
we
submit
that
they
still
do
not
come
under
the
prescribed
conditions
of
flast
v.
cohen
and
golden
v.
zwickler.
we
feel
that
the
lower
court
properly
denied
them
standing.
as
to
the
unmarried
pregnant
female,
a
unique
situation
arises
in.
is
her
action
now
moot?
of
course
if
moot,
there
is
no
case
or
controversy.
mr.
jay
floyd
it
was
a
class
action.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
the
only
thing
that
would
uphold
her
standing
would
be
-
or
eliminate
the
mootness
issue
-
would
be
whether
or
not
this
is
a
class
action
on
her
part.
the
record
that
came
up
to
this
court
contains
the
amended
petition
of
jane
roe,
an
unsigned
alias
affidavit,
and
that
is
all.
she
alleges
that
she
was
pregnant
on
april
the
20th,
1970,
which
is
some
21
months
ago.
now
i
think
that
it
is
-
it
has
been
recognized
by
the
appellant's
counsel
that
she
is
no
longer
pregnant.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
time
of
determination
of
mootness
is
when
the
hearing
is
before
the
court.
that
is,
the
case
can
become
moot
from
the
hearing
in
the
trial
court
until
the
time
it
reaches
this
court.
we
do
not
feel
appellant's
authority
contained
in
her
brief
will
substantiate
her
contention
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
i
might
add
this
that
i
believe
the
law
to
be
that
if
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
re-occurrence
of
the
situation,
then
the
case
would
not
be
moot.
now,
this
is
the
w.t.
grant
case.
the
other
case,
or
cases,
concerned
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
in
which
the
court
holds
that
there
is
a
possibility
or
a
reasonable
possibility
of
continuation
of
those
orders,
and
the
capability
of
repetition.
it
deals
mainly
with
the
capability
of
repetition.
we
think
the
case
of
jane
roe
can
be
easily
compared
to
hall
v.
beals.
in
that
particular
case
a
group
of
voters
instituted
a
class
action
complaining
of
a
colorado
statute
which
prescribed
a
residency
requirement
of
six
months.
they
had,
at
the
time,
lived
in
the
state,
or
at
the
time
of
the
election
lived
in
the
state,
some
four
or
five
months.
the
case
came
up
through
the
lower
courts
to
this
court.
and,
in
the
meantime
colorado
repealed
the
statute
and
established
a
two-months
residency
requirement.
the
election
was
held
in
the
meantime.
the
trial
court
plaintiffs
complained
of
the
two-months
residency
requirement.
this
court
held
the
cause
of
action
moot
even
though
it
was
denominated
as
a
class
action
mr.
jay
floyd
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
fact
was
that
you
still
had-if
it
is
what
you
want
to
call
it
-
the
evil
still
existing.
mr.
jay
floyd
that
is
not
what
we
call
white
horse.
mr.
jay
floyd
in
connection
with
the
class
action
aspect
of
this,
and
i
say
i
have
no
authority
to
support
this
proposition;
but
it
would
appear
that
in
order
for
a
class
action
to
continue,
if
there
be
one
to
begin
with,
is
that
one
plaintiff
must
remain,
or
else
an
intervenor,
or
someone,
to
be
a
representative
of
the
class.
because
this
is
the
whole
purpose
of
the
class
action,
to
have
a
representative
in
court.
now,
the
position
of
the
appellant
hallford.
mr.
jay
floyd
your
honor,
let
me
answer
your
question
with
a
statement,
if
i
may.
i
do
not
believe
it
can
be
done.
there
are
situations
in
which,
of
course
as
the
court
knows,
no
remedy
is
provided.
now
i
think
she
makes
her
choice
prior
to
the
time
she
becomes
pregnant.
that
is
the
time
of
the
choice.
it's
like,
more
or
less,
the
first
three
or
four
years
of
our
life
we
don't
remember
anything.
but,
once
a
child
is
born,
a
woman
no
longer
has
a
choice,
and
i
think
pregnancy
may
terminate
that
choice.
that's
when
mr.
jay
floyd
may
i
proceed?
there
is
no
restriction
on
moving.
your
honor,
the
appellant
hallford
is
under
two
indictments,
charged
with
the
offense
of
performing
an
abortion.
there
are
no
allegations
in
the
complaint
of
appellant
hallford
-
or
none
in
his
affidavit
that
there
is
any
bad
faith
prosecution,
bad
faith
arrest,
harassment
of
him
at
all,
to
bring
him
within
dombrowski's
special
circumstances.
we
think
the
cases
of
younger
v.
harris
and
samuels
v.
mackell
are
controlling
as
to
dr.
hallford's
position.
we
also
feel
that
dr.
hallford
cannot
rely
upon
his
patients'
right
to
bring
him
into
federal
court.
and
i
think
the
tilston
v.
ullman
case
will
be
authority
for
that
proposition.
as
to
the
matter
of
injunctive
relief
after
the
court
once
grants
declaratory
relief,
i
will
make
this
comment,
that
it
appears
the
court
can
consider
the
propriety
of
declaratory
relief,
and
can
consider
the
propriety
of
injunctive
relief.
that
is,
the
court
can
divorce
the
two.
and,
once
granting
declaratory
relief
that
a
statute
is
unconstitutional,
in
its
discretion
can
determine
whether
or
not
injunctive
relief
is
proper,
and
deny
it
if
it
so
pleases.
now,
should
this
court,
as
i
understand
it,
and
all
the
parties
feel
that
if
this
court
once
acquired
jurisdiction
over
the
matter,
that
these
parties
would
like
the
court
to
consider
all
the
constitutional
issues
--
mr.
jay
floyd
no,
your
honor.
i
say
the
court
can
grant
declaratory
relief
on
constitutionality,
and
deny
injunctive
relief.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
floyd
that's
correct.
i
think
if
the
court,
of
course,
says.--
mr.
jay
floyd
we
could
not,
to
this
court,
your
honor.
we
have
to
go
to
the
fifth
circuit.
so,
we
have
--
mr.
jay
floyd
we
are
asking
the
court,
requesting
the
court,
to
do
this,
that
if
the
court
gets
into
the
merits
of
injunctive
relief;
whether
or
not
it
was
proper
under
the
circumstances;
that
this
court
go
forward,
and
continue
the
other
or
continue
the
constitutional
issues
and
make
a
determination.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
floyd
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
proceedings
in
the
fifth
circuit
have
been
staid
or
abated.
mr.
jay
floyd
well,
your
honor
-
and
i
don't
want
to
be
repetitious,
but
a
motion
has
been
filed
in
the
fifth
circuit
to
hold
the
appeal
in
abeyance
until
a
determination
by
this
court.
mr.
jay
floyd
no.
we
have
requested
that
in
our
reply
to
the
jurisdiction,
and
in
our
brief.
we
have
presented
it
in
that
manner.
your
honor,
we
feel
that
this
court
can,
and
should
consider
all
the
issues.
and,
under
the
sterling,
florida
lime
and
avocado
growers,
and
the
carter
cases,
which
are
cited
in
the
briefs
of
the
parties.
mr.
jay
floyd
mr.
justice,
the
thompson
case,
which
has
been
cited
to
the
court
--
thompson
v.
state
--
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
not
decide
the
issue
of
privacy.
it
was
not
before
the
court;
or,
the
right
of
choice
issue.
the
state
court,
court
of
criminal
appeals,
held
that
the
state
had
a
compelling
interest
because
of
the
protection
of
fetal
life.
they
recognized
the
humanness
of
the
embryo,
or
the
fetus,
and
they
said,
we
have
an
interest
in
protecting
fetal
life.
whether
or
not
that
was
the
original
intent
of
the
statute,
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
jay
floyd
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
matter
has
been
brought
to
my
attention.
why
not
punish
for
murder,
since
you
are
destroying
what
you
-
or
what
has
been
said
to
be
a
human
being?
i
do
not
know,
except
that
i
will
say
this.
as
medical
science
progresses,
maybe
the
law
will
progress
along
with
it.
maybe
at
one
time
it
could
be
possible,
i
suppose,
statutes
could
be
passed.
whether
or
not
that
would
be
constitutional
or
not,
i
don't
know
mr.
jay
floyd
there
is
none,
your
honor,
except
one
of
our
statutes
that
if
the
mother
dies,
that
the
doctor
shall
be
guilty
of
murder.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes.
mr.
jay
floyd
just
i
would
say
so
mr.
justice
yes.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
it
does,
mr.
justice.
yes.
mr.
jay
floyd
mr.
justice
this
case
is
just
a
recent
case.
mr.
jay
floyd
it
is
not
in
the
reporter
system
yet.
mr.
jay
floyd
i'll
be
happy
to,
yes,
sir,
provide
the
court
with
copies
of
that.
mr.
jay
floyd
this
is
no.
44070,
c.
w.
thompson
v.
the
state
of
texas.
the
opinion
was
delivered
on
november
the
2nd,
1971.
mr.
jay
floyd
i
shall
be
happy
to
furnish
the
court
with
this
copy,
if
the
court
so
desires.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
your
honor.
now,
there's
one--
mr.
jay
floyd
now,
in
addition,
the
thompson
case
cited
vuitch
case,
in
regard
to
vagueness,
and
said
that
it
was
controlling
the
issue.
and,
as
i
recall,
that
dr.
thompson
raised
the
issue
of:
well,
how
can
you
find
me
guilty
of
murder,
i
mean
of
abortion,
if
you
make
no
determination
that
the
fetus
is
alive
at
the
time
i
performed
this?
in
effect
is
what
he's
saying.
he
never
admitted
doing
it.
but
he's
saying,
how
can
you
prove
it?
of
course
the
texas
court
answered
by
saying,
it
is
presumed
the
fetus
was
alive
when
an
abortion
is
performed.
mr.
jay
floyd
well,
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
i--
mr.
jay
floyd
i
think
that
original
purpose,
mr.
justice,
and
the
present
prevailing
purpose,
may
be
the
same
in
this
respect.
there
have
been
statistics
furnished
to
this
court
in
various
briefs
from
various
groups,
and
from
medical
societies
of
different
groups
of
physicians
and
gynecologists,
or
whatever
it
may
be.
these
statistics
have
not
shown
me,
for
example,
that
abortion
is
safer
than
normal
childbirth.
they
have
not
shown
me
that
there
are
not
emotional
problems
that
are
very
important,
resulting
from
an
abortion.
the
protection
of
the
mother,
at
one
time,
may
still
be
the
primary
-
but
the
policy
considerations,
mr.
justice,
would
seem
to
me
to
be
for
the
state
legislature
to
make
a
decision.
mr.
jay
floyd
this
is
just
from
my
-
l
speak
personally,
if
i
may
i
would
think
that
even
when
this
statute
was
first
passed,
there
was
some
concern
for
the
unborn
fetus.
mr.
jay
floyd
1859
was
the
original
statute.
this,
i
believe,
was
around
1900,
1907.
mr.
jay
floyd
it
goes
back...
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
floyd
as
far
as
i
know
there
were
not,
no.
i
think
this
is,
maybe,
set
out
in
some
of
the
briefs.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes.
mr.
jay
floyd
well,
as
i
say,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
courts
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
unborn
has
full
juristic
rights.
not
yet.
maybe
they
will.
i
don't
know.
i
just
don't
feel
like
they
have,
at
the
present
time.
mr.
jay
floyd
sir?
mr.
jay
floyd
at
any
time,
mr.
justice.
we
make
no
distinctions
in
our
statute.
mr.
jay
floyd
we
say
there
is
life
from
the
moment
of
impregnation.
mr.
jay
floyd
well
we
begin,
mr.
justice,
in
our
brief,
with
the
development
of
the
human
embryo,
carrying
it
through
the
development
of
the
fetus
from
about
seven
to
nine
days
after
conception.
mr.
jay
floyd
we
don't
know.
mr.
jay
floyd
i
don't.
--
mr.
justice,
there
are
unanswerable
questions
in
this
field.
mr.
jay
floyd
this
is
an
artless
statement
on
my
part.
mr.
jay
floyd
thank
you.
when
does
the
soul
come
into
the
unborn
-
if
a
person
believes
in
the
soul,
i
don't
know.
i
assume
the
appellants
now
are
operating
under
the
ninth
amendment
rights.
there
are
allegations
of
first
amendment
rights
being
violated.
however,
i
feel
there
is
no
merit.
this
statute
does
not
establish
any
religion;
nor
does
it
prohibit
anyone
from
practicing
of
any
part
of
any
religious
group.
i
see
no
merit
in
their
contentions
that
it
could
possibly
be
under
freedom
of
speech
or
press.
in
fact,
there
have
been
some
articles
recently
in
this
city's
newspaper
-
yesterday,
for
instance
about
it.
the
other
constitutional
rights
that
the
appellant
speaks
of,
i
think,
are
expressed
in
two
manners:
the
individual,
or
marital
right
of
privacy;
and,
secondly
-
or
--
or
the
right
to
choose
whether
or
not
to
abort
a
child.
now,
if
those
are
out
of
the
case,
the
marital
privacy
is
out
of
the
case.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
neither
individual
nor
marital
privacy
has
been
held
to
be
absolute.
we
have
legal
search
and
seizure.
we
have
the
possession
of
illegal
drugs;
the
practice
of
polygamy,
and
other
matters.
a
parent,
i
do
not
believe
or
parents,
cannot
refuse
to
give
their
child
some
form
of
education.
as
far
as
the
freedom
over
one's
body
is
concerned,
this
is
not
absolute,
the
use
of
illicit
drugs;
the
indecent
exposure
legislation;
and,
as
mr.
goldberg
stated
in
the
griswold
case,
that
adultery
and
fornication
are
constitutional
beyond
doubt.
mr.
jay
floyd
the
laws
against
them
are
constitutional.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
united
states
constitution
concerning
birth,
contraception,
or
abortion.
now,
the
appellee
does
not
disagree
with
the
appellants'
statement
that
a
woman
has
a
choice.
but,
as
we
have
previously
mentioned,
we
feel
that
this
choice
is
left
up
to
the
woman,
prior
to
the
time
she
becomes
pregnant.
this
is
the
time
of
the
choice.
now
this
was
brought
out
in
the
rosen
v.
louisiana
state
board
of
medical
examiners
case,
and
in
corkey
v.
edwards,
which
are
lower
court
opinions,
and
my
understanding
is
that
corkey
v.
edwards
has
been
adopted
in
this
court.
mr.
jay
floyd
has
been,
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
positive,
but
i
think
it
has
been.
mr.
jay
floyd
there
is
nothing
in
our
statute
about
that.
now,
the
procedure...
mr.
jay
floyd
the
procedure
-
and
now
i'm
telling
the
court
something
that's
outside
the
record
-
as
i
understand,
the
procedure
when
a
woman
is
brought
in
after
a
rape,
is
to
try
to
stop
whatever
has
occurred,
immediately,
by
the
proper
procedure
in
the
hospital.
immediately
she's
taken
there,
if
she
reports
it
immediately.
but,
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute.
now,
as
i
previously
informed
the
court,
the
statistics
or
the
people
who
prepare
the
statistics,
and
the
different
statistics
are
not
in
conformity
in
connection
with
the
medical
aspects
of
abortion;
that
is,
whether
or
not
it's
safer.
there
are
some
statistics
that
will
say
it
is
and
statistics
that
say
it's
not.
it
has
been
provided
to
this
court,
the
common
law
and
the
legislative
history
of
abortion;
and
that
the
morality
of
abortion
has
been
injected
in
various
cases
by
various
groups.
we
think
these
matters
are
matters
of
policy
which
can
be
properly
addressed
by
the
state
legislature.
we
think
that
a
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
unborn,
and
in
some
instances,
a
consideration
should
be
given
for
the
father,
if
he
would
be
objective
to
abortion.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
floyd
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
an
old
joke,
but
when
a
man
argues
against
two
beautiful
ladies
like
this,
they
are
going
to
have
the
last
word.
before
i
proceed
to
the
original
issue
in
this
case-which
was
the
propriety
of
the
trial
court
grant,
or
denying
of
injunctive
relief
-
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
some
grave
matters
concerning
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
standing
of
the
parties.
the
couple
involved:
they
were
a
married
couple,
childless
married
couple.
the
only
matter,
evidence,
or
whatever,
in
the
record
concerning
their
contentions
is
contained
in
their
first
amended
original
petition.
that
is,
that
the
woman
would
have
difficulty
if
she
became
pregnant
in
carrying
a
child
to
childbirth.
further,
that
they
were
unprepared
for
parenthood.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
their
cause
of
action
is
strictly
based
upon
conjecture.
will
they
continue
the
marriage?
will
her
health
improve?
will
they
then
be,
at
some
time
in
the
future,
prepared
or
unprepared
for
parenthood?
there
is
no
fear
of
prosecution
by
mary
doe.
if
we
accept
all
contentions
of
this
married
couple,
we
submit
that
they
still
do
not
come
under
the
prescribed
conditions
of
flast
v.
cohen
and
golden
v.
zwickler.
we
feel
that
the
lower
court
properly
denied
them
standing.
as
to
the
unmarried
pregnant
female,
a
unique
situation
arises
in.
is
her
action
now
moot?
of
course
if
moot,
there
is
no
case
or
controversy.
mr.
jay
floyd
it
was
a
class
action.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
the
only
thing
that
would
uphold
her
standing
would
be
-
or
eliminate
the
mootness
issue
-
would
be
whether
or
not
this
is
a
class
action
on
her
part.
the
record
that
came
up
to
this
court
contains
the
amended
petition
of
jane
roe,
an
unsigned
alias
affidavit,
and
that
is
all.
she
alleges
that
she
was
pregnant
on
april
the
20th,
1970,
which
is
some
21
months
ago.
now
i
think
that
it
is
-
it
has
been
recognized
by
the
appellant's
counsel
that
she
is
no
longer
pregnant.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
time
of
determination
of
mootness
is
when
the
hearing
is
before
the
court.
that
is,
the
case
can
become
moot
from
the
hearing
in
the
trial
court
until
the
time
it
reaches
this
court.
we
do
not
feel
appellant's
authority
contained
in
her
brief
will
substantiate
her
contention
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
i
might
add
this
that
i
believe
the
law
to
be
that
if
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
re-occurrence
of
the
situation,
then
the
case
would
not
be
moot.
now,
this
is
the
w.t.
grant
case.
the
other
case,
or
cases,
concerned
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
in
which
the
court
holds
that
there
is
a
possibility
or
a
reasonable
possibility
of
continuation
of
those
orders,
and
the
capability
of
repetition.
it
deals
mainly
with
the
capability
of
repetition.
we
think
the
case
of
jane
roe
can
be
easily
compared
to
hall
v.
beals.
in
that
particular
case
a
group
of
voters
instituted
a
class
action
complaining
of
a
colorado
statute
which
prescribed
a
residency
requirement
of
six
months.
they
had,
at
the
time,
lived
in
the
state,
or
at
the
time
of
the
election
lived
in
the
state,
some
four
or
five
months.
the
case
came
up
through
the
lower
courts
to
this
court.
and,
in
the
meantime
colorado
repealed
the
statute
and
established
a
two-months
residency
requirement.
the
election
was
held
in
the
meantime.
the
trial
court
plaintiffs
complained
of
the
two-months
residency
requirement.
this
court
held
the
cause
of
action
moot
even
though
it
was
denominated
as
a
class
action
mr.
jay
floyd
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
fact
was
that
you
still
had-if
it
is
what
you
want
to
call
it
-
the
evil
still
existing.
mr.
jay
floyd
that
is
not
what
we
call
white
horse.
mr.
jay
floyd
in
connection
with
the
class
action
aspect
of
this,
and
i
say
i
have
no
authority
to
support
this
proposition;
but
it
would
appear
that
in
order
for
a
class
action
to
continue,
if
there
be
one
to
begin
with,
is
that
one
plaintiff
must
remain,
or
else
an
intervenor,
or
someone,
to
be
a
representative
of
the
class.
because
this
is
the
whole
purpose
of
the
class
action,
to
have
a
representative
in
court.
now,
the
position
of
the
appellant
hallford.
mr.
jay
floyd
your
honor,
let
me
answer
your
question
with
a
statement,
if
i
may.
i
do
not
believe
it
can
be
done.
there
are
situations
in
which,
of
course
as
the
court
knows,
no
remedy
is
provided.
now
i
think
she
makes
her
choice
prior
to
the
time
she
becomes
pregnant.
that
is
the
time
of
the
choice.
it's
like,
more
or
less,
the
first
three
or
four
years
of
our
life
we
don't
remember
anything.
but,
once
a
child
is
born,
a
woman
no
longer
has
a
choice,
and
i
think
pregnancy
may
terminate
that
choice.
that's
when
mr.
jay
floyd
may
i
proceed?
there
is
no
restriction
on
moving.
your
honor,
the
appellant
hallford
is
under
two
indictments,
charged
with
the
offense
of
performing
an
abortion.
there
are
no
allegations
in
the
complaint
of
appellant
hallford
-
or
none
in
his
affidavit
that
there
is
any
bad
faith
prosecution,
bad
faith
arrest,
harassment
of
him
at
all,
to
bring
him
within
dombrowski's
special
circumstances.
we
think
the
cases
of
younger
v.
harris
and
samuels
v.
mackell
are
controlling
as
to
dr.
hallford's
position.
we
also
feel
that
dr.
hallford
cannot
rely
upon
his
patients'
right
to
bring
him
into
federal
court.
and
i
think
the
tilston
v.
ullman
case
will
be
authority
for
that
proposition.
as
to
the
matter
of
injunctive
relief
after
the
court
once
grants
declaratory
relief,
i
will
make
this
comment,
that
it
appears
the
court
can
consider
the
propriety
of
declaratory
relief,
and
can
consider
the
propriety
of
injunctive
relief.
that
is,
the
court
can
divorce
the
two.
and,
once
granting
declaratory
relief
that
a
statute
is
unconstitutional,
in
its
discretion
can
determine
whether
or
not
injunctive
relief
is
proper,
and
deny
it
if
it
so
pleases.
now,
should
this
court,
as
i
understand
it,
and
all
the
parties
feel
that
if
this
court
once
acquired
jurisdiction
over
the
matter,
that
these
parties
would
like
the
court
to
consider
all
the
constitutional
issues
--
mr.
jay
floyd
no,
your
honor.
i
say
the
court
can
grant
declaratory
relief
on
constitutionality,
and
deny
injunctive
relief.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
floyd
that's
correct.
i
think
if
the
court,
of
course,
says.--
mr.
jay
floyd
we
could
not,
to
this
court,
your
honor.
we
have
to
go
to
the
fifth
circuit.
so,
we
have
--
mr.
jay
floyd
we
are
asking
the
court,
requesting
the
court,
to
do
this,
that
if
the
court
gets
into
the
merits
of
injunctive
relief;
whether
or
not
it
was
proper
under
the
circumstances;
that
this
court
go
forward,
and
continue
the
other
or
continue
the
constitutional
issues
and
make
a
determination.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
floyd
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
proceedings
in
the
fifth
circuit
have
been
staid
or
abated.
mr.
jay
floyd
well,
your
honor
-
and
i
don't
want
to
be
repetitious,
but
a
motion
has
been
filed
in
the
fifth
circuit
to
hold
the
appeal
in
abeyance
until
a
determination
by
this
court.
mr.
jay
floyd
no.
we
have
requested
that
in
our
reply
to
the
jurisdiction,
and
in
our
brief.
we
have
presented
it
in
that
manner.
your
honor,
we
feel
that
this
court
can,
and
should
consider
all
the
issues.
and,
under
the
sterling,
florida
lime
and
avocado
growers,
and
the
carter
cases,
which
are
cited
in
the
briefs
of
the
parties.
mr.
jay
floyd
mr.
justice,
the
thompson
case,
which
has
been
cited
to
the
court
--
thompson
v.
state
--
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
not
decide
the
issue
of
privacy.
it
was
not
before
the
court;
or,
the
right
of
choice
issue.
the
state
court,
court
of
criminal
appeals,
held
that
the
state
had
a
compelling
interest
because
of
the
protection
of
fetal
life.
they
recognized
the
humanness
of
the
embryo,
or
the
fetus,
and
they
said,
we
have
an
interest
in
protecting
fetal
life.
whether
or
not
that
was
the
original
intent
of
the
statute,
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
jay
floyd
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
matter
has
been
brought
to
my
attention.
why
not
punish
for
murder,
since
you
are
destroying
what
you
-
or
what
has
been
said
to
be
a
human
being?
i
do
not
know,
except
that
i
will
say
this.
as
medical
science
progresses,
maybe
the
law
will
progress
along
with
it.
maybe
at
one
time
it
could
be
possible,
i
suppose,
statutes
could
be
passed.
whether
or
not
that
would
be
constitutional
or
not,
i
don't
know
mr.
jay
floyd
there
is
none,
your
honor,
except
one
of
our
statutes
that
if
the
mother
dies,
that
the
doctor
shall
be
guilty
of
murder.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes.
mr.
jay
floyd
just
i
would
say
so
mr.
justice
yes.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
it
does,
mr.
justice.
yes.
mr.
jay
floyd
mr.
justice
this
case
is
just
a
recent
case.
mr.
jay
floyd
it
is
not
in
the
reporter
system
yet.
mr.
jay
floyd
i'll
be
happy
to,
yes,
sir,
provide
the
court
with
copies
of
that.
mr.
jay
floyd
this
is
no.
44070,
c.
w.
thompson
v.
the
state
of
texas.
the
opinion
was
delivered
on
november
the
2nd,
1971.
mr.
jay
floyd
i
shall
be
happy
to
furnish
the
court
with
this
copy,
if
the
court
so
desires.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
your
honor.
now,
there's
one--
mr.
jay
floyd
now,
in
addition,
the
thompson
case
cited
vuitch
case,
in
regard
to
vagueness,
and
said
that
it
was
controlling
the
issue.
and,
as
i
recall,
that
dr.
thompson
raised
the
issue
of:
well,
how
can
you
find
me
guilty
of
murder,
i
mean
of
abortion,
if
you
make
no
determination
that
the
fetus
is
alive
at
the
time
i
performed
this?
in
effect
is
what
he's
saying.
he
never
admitted
doing
it.
but
he's
saying,
how
can
you
prove
it?
of
course
the
texas
court
answered
by
saying,
it
is
presumed
the
fetus
was
alive
when
an
abortion
is
performed.
mr.
jay
floyd
well,
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
i--
mr.
jay
floyd
i
think
that
original
purpose,
mr.
justice,
and
the
present
prevailing
purpose,
may
be
the
same
in
this
respect.
there
have
been
statistics
furnished
to
this
court
in
various
briefs
from
various
groups,
and
from
medical
societies
of
different
groups
of
physicians
and
gynecologists,
or
whatever
it
may
be.
these
statistics
have
not
shown
me,
for
example,
that
abortion
is
safer
than
normal
childbirth.
they
have
not
shown
me
that
there
are
not
emotional
problems
that
are
very
important,
resulting
from
an
abortion.
the
protection
of
the
mother,
at
one
time,
may
still
be
the
primary
-
but
the
policy
considerations,
mr.
justice,
would
seem
to
me
to
be
for
the
state
legislature
to
make
a
decision.
mr.
jay
floyd
this
is
just
from
my
-
l
speak
personally,
if
i
may
i
would
think
that
even
when
this
statute
was
first
passed,
there
was
some
concern
for
the
unborn
fetus.
mr.
jay
floyd
1859
was
the
original
statute.
this,
i
believe,
was
around
1900,
1907.
mr.
jay
floyd
it
goes
back...
mr.
jay
floyd
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
floyd
as
far
as
i
know
there
were
not,
no.
i
think
this
is,
maybe,
set
out
in
some
of
the
briefs.
mr.
jay
floyd
yes.
mr.
jay
floyd
well,
as
i
say,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
courts
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
unborn
has
full
juristic
rights.
not
yet.
maybe
they
will.
i
don't
know.
i
just
don't
feel
like
they
have,
at
the
present
time.
mr.
jay
floyd
sir?
mr.
jay
floyd
at
any
time,
mr.
justice.
we
make
no
distinctions
in
our
statute.
mr.
jay
floyd
we
say
there
is
life
from
the
moment
of
impregnation.
mr.
jay
floyd
well
we
begin,
mr.
justice,
in
our
brief,
with
the
development
of
the
human
embryo,
carrying
it
through
the
development
of
the
fetus
from
about
seven
to
nine
days
after
conception.
mr.
jay
floyd
we
don't
know.
mr.
jay
floyd
i
don't.
--
mr.
justice,
there
are
unanswerable
questions
in
this
field.
mr.
jay
floyd
this
is
an
artless
statement
on
my
part.
mr.
jay
floyd
thank
you.
when
does
the
soul
come
into
the
unborn
-
if
a
person
believes
in
the
soul,
i
don't
know.
i
assume
the
appellants
now
are
operating
under
the
ninth
amendment
rights.
there
are
allegations
of
first
amendment
rights
being
violated.
however,
i
feel
there
is
no
merit.
this
statute
does
not
establish
any
religion;
nor
does
it
prohibit
anyone
from
practicing
of
any
part
of
any
religious
group.
i
see
no
merit
in
their
contentions
that
it
could
possibly
be
under
freedom
of
speech
or
press.
in
fact,
there
have
been
some
articles
recently
in
this
city's
newspaper
-
yesterday,
for
instance
about
it.
the
other
constitutional
rights
that
the
appellant
speaks
of,
i
think,
are
expressed
in
two
manners:
the
individual,
or
marital
right
of
privacy;
and,
secondly
-
or
--
or
the
right
to
choose
whether
or
not
to
abort
a
child.
now,
if
those
are
out
of
the
case,
the
marital
privacy
is
out
of
the
case.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
neither
individual
nor
marital
privacy
has
been
held
to
be
absolute.
we
have
legal
search
and
seizure.
we
have
the
possession
of
illegal
drugs;
the
practice
of
polygamy,
and
other
matters.
a
parent,
i
do
not
believe
or
parents,
cannot
refuse
to
give
their
child
some
form
of
education.
as
far
as
the
freedom
over
one's
body
is
concerned,
this
is
not
absolute,
the
use
of
illicit
drugs;
the
indecent
exposure
legislation;
and,
as
mr.
goldberg
stated
in
the
griswold
case,
that
adultery
and
fornication
are
constitutional
beyond
doubt.
mr.
jay
floyd
the
laws
against
them
are
constitutional.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
united
states
constitution
concerning
birth,
contraception,
or
abortion.
now,
the
appellee
does
not
disagree
with
the
appellants'
statement
that
a
woman
has
a
choice.
but,
as
we
have
previously
mentioned,
we
feel
that
this
choice
is
left
up
to
the
woman,
prior
to
the
time
she
becomes
pregnant.
this
is
the
time
of
the
choice.
now
this
was
brought
out
in
the
rosen
v.
louisiana
state
board
of
medical
examiners
case,
and
in
corkey
v.
edwards,
which
are
lower
court
opinions,
and
my
understanding
is
that
corkey
v.
edwards
has
been
adopted
in
this
court.
mr.
jay
floyd
has
been,
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
positive,
but
i
think
it
has
been.
mr.
jay
floyd
there
is
nothing
in
our
statute
about
that.
now,
the
procedure...
mr.
jay
floyd
the
procedure
-
and
now
i'm
telling
the
court
something
that's
outside
the
record
-
as
i
understand,
the
procedure
when
a
woman
is
brought
in
after
a
rape,
is
to
try
to
stop
whatever
has
occurred,
immediately,
by
the
proper
procedure
in
the
hospital.
immediately
she's
taken
there,
if
she
reports
it
immediately.
but,
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute.
now,
as
i
previously
informed
the
court,
the
statistics
or
the
people
who
prepare
the
statistics,
and
the
different
statistics
are
not
in
conformity
in
connection
with
the
medical
aspects
of
abortion;
that
is,
whether
or
not
it's
safer.
there
are
some
statistics
that
will
say
it
is
and
statistics
that
say
it's
not.
it
has
been
provided
to
this
court,
the
common
law
and
the
legislative
history
of
abortion;
and
that
the
morality
of
abortion
has
been
injected
in
various
cases
by
various
groups.
we
think
these
matters
are
matters
of
policy
which
can
be
properly
addressed
by
the
state
legislature.
we
think
that
a
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
unborn,
and
in
some
instances,
a
consideration
should
be
given
for
the
father,
if
he
would
be
objective
to
abortion.
thank
you,
your
honor.
