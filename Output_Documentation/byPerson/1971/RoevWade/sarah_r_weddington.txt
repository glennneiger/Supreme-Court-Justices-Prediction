ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
instant
case
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
united
state
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
texas.
the
court
declared
the
texas
abortion
law
to
the
unconstitutional
for
two
reasons:
first,
that
the
law
was
impermissibly
vague,
and,
second,
that
it
violated
a
woman’s
right
to
continue
or
terminate
a
pregnancy.
although
the
court
granted
declaratory
relief,
the
court
denied
appellant’s
request
for
injunctive
relief.
the
texas
law
in
question
permits
abortions
to
be
performed
only
in
instances
where
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
saving
the
life
of
the
woman.
the
case
originated
with
the
filing
of
two
separate
complaints,
the
first
being
filed
on
behalf
of
jane
roe,
an
unmarried
pregnant
girl
and
the
second
being
filed
on
behalf
of
jane
and
mary
doe,
a
married
couple.
jane
roe,
the
pregnant
woman,
had
gone
to
several
dallas
physicians
seeking
an
abortion,
but
had
been
refused
care
because
of
the
texas
law.
she
filed
suit
on
behalf
of
herself
and
all
those
women
who
have
in
the
past
at
that
present
time
or
in
the
future
would
seek
termination
of
a
pregnancy.
in
her
affidavit
she
did
state
some
of
the
reasons
that
she
desired
an
abortion
at
the
time
she
sought
one.
but,
contrary
to
the
contentions
of
appellee,
she
continued
to
desire
the
abortion.
and
it
was
not
only
at
the
time
she
sought
the
abortion
that
her
desire
was
to
terminate
the
pregnancy.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that
is
correct.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
your
honor,
i
do
not.
in
the
vuitch
decision
this
court
was
working
with
a
statute
which
provided
that
an
abortion
could
be
performed
for
reasons
of
health
or
life.
our
texas
statute
provides
an
abortion
only
where
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
saving
the
life
of
the
woman.
since
the
vuitch
decision
was
rendered,
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
-which
is
our
highest
court
of
criminal
jurisdiction
has
held
that
the
texas
law
is
not
vague,
citing
the
vuitch
decision,
but
saying
that
the
texas
law
is
more
definite
than
the
d.c.
law.
so,
obviously
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
doesn't
feel
that
the
two
are
the
same.
and
in
the
vuitch
decision,
the
justices
of
this
court
emphasized
continuously
that
a
doctor,
as
a
matter
of
routine,
works
with
the
problem
of
what
is
best
for
the
health
of
his
patients.
we
submit
that
a
doctor
is
not
used
to
being
restricted
to
acting
only
when
it's
for
the
purpose
of
saving
the
life
of
the
woman,
and
that
health
is
a
continuum
which
runs
into
life.
and
a
doctor
in
our
state
does
not
know
whether
he
can
perform
an
abortion
only
when
death
is
imminent
or
when
the
woman's
life
would
be
shortened.
he
does
not
know
if
the
death
must
be
certain,
or
if
it
could
be
an
increase
in
probability
of
her
death.
so
here,
in
the
district,
doctors
are
able
to
exercise
their
normal
matter
of
judgment,
whether
or
not
the
health
of
the
woman,
mental
or
physical
will
be
affected.
but,
in
texas,
we
tell
the
doctor
that
unless
he
can
decide
whether
it's
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
saving
her
life,
and
for
no
other
reason,
that
he
is
subject
to
criminal
sanctions.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
the
range
of
problems
that
could
be
presented
to
a
doctor.
the
court,
for
example,
cited
the
instance
of
suicide,
if
a
woman
comes
in
alleging
that
she
will
commit
suicide.
is
it
then
necessary
for
him
to
do
or
can
he
do
an
abortion
for
the
purpose
of
saving
her
life?
or,
is
that
a
situation
where
he
has
to
have
something
more?
i
think
all
of
those
questions
cannot
be
answered,
at
this
point.
this
brings
up
the
married
couple
in
our
case.
the
woman
in
that
case
had
a
neurochemical
condition.
her
doctor
had
advised
her
not
to
get
pregnant,
and
not
to
take
the
birth
control
pills.
she
was
using
alternative
means
of
birth
control,
but
she
and
her
husband
were
fearful
that
she
would
become
pregnant
and
that,
although
the
neurochemical
condition
would
impair
her
health,
evidently
her
doctor
did
not
feel
that
she
would
die
if
she
continued
the
pregnancy.
and
certainly
they
were
very
concerned
about
the
effect
of
the
statute,
and
her
physician
seemed
uncertain
about
its
implications.
the
doctors
in
our
state
continue
to
feel
that
our
law
is
vague.
certainly,
we
introduced
affidavits
in
the
lower
court
to
that
effect.
since
the
time
of
the
lower
court
ruling,
the
district
attorney
in
texas
has
said
that
he
considers
the
federal
court
decision
there
not
to
be
binding.
and
we
do
have
a
letter
from
him
and
the
first
thing
in
our
appendix
to
the
brief,
stating
that
he
will
continue
to
prosecute.
so
the
doctors
in
texas,
even
with
the
federal
decision
and
even
after
the
vuitch
decision,
do
not
feel
free
to
perform
abortions.
and,
instead,
728
women
in
the
first
nine
months
after
the
decision
went
to
new
york
for
an
abortion.
texas
women
are
coming
here.
it's
so
often
the
poor
and
the
disadvantaged
in
texas
who
are
not
able
to
escape
the
effect
of
the
law.
certainly,
there
are
many
texas
women
who
are
affected
because
our
doctors
still
feel
uncertain
about
the
impact
of
the
law,
even
in
light
of
the
vuitch
decision.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes.
your
honor.
we
do.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor,
there
are.
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
my
reading
of
younger
versus
harris,
the
companion
cases,
all
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
those
cases
was
a
situation
where
there
was
an
attempt
to
interfere
with
a
pending
state
criminal
prosecution.
in
this
case,
as
i
pointed
out,
the
original
parties
to
this
matter
are
women,
and
in
one
case,
the
husband.
the
women
certainly
are
not
subject
to
prosecution
in
the
state
of
texas.
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
stand
in
the
criminal
dock
and
litigate
their
interests.
they
came
seeking
injunctive
relief.
but
it
was
not
against
pending
state
criminal
prosecution.
they
were
not
even
aware
of
the
prosecution
against
dr.
hallford.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
we
have
expressed
texas
cases.
in
one
situation,
woodrow
v.
state,
an
1880
case,
the
woman
had
taken
a
potion
to
induce
abortion,
and
the
texas
court
specifically
said
that
the
woman
is
guilty
of
no
crime,
even
in
that
situation.
and,
that
in
fact
she
is
the
victim
of
our
law.
there
is
no
declaratory
relief
available
for
these
plaintiffs.
their
only
forum
was
the
federal
courts,
and
it
was
to
those
courts
that
they
turned
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes
sir.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
the
physician
intervened
after
the
order
was
entered
granting
jane
roe
a
three-judge
court.
and
he
intervened,
again,
asking
only
that
future
prosecution
under
the
law
be
enjoined.
he
did
not
ask
any
relief
of
the
court
relating
to
his
pending
state
criminal
prosecution.
he
did
specifically,
in
his
complaint,
reserve
the
right
to
ask
for
future
relief.
but,
that
was
never
done.
and
certainly,
in
the
future,
he
were
to
ask
for
relief,
the
court
would
have
the
guidance
of
the
younger
versus
harris
companion
cases.
but
there
was
in
no
way
any
request
for
any
action
to
interfere
with
the
pending
criminal
prosecutions
then
in
process.
there
is
an
allegation
that
the
question
is
moot
since
the
woman
has
now
has
carried
the
pregnancy
to
term.
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
realize
that
there
are
several
important
aspects
in
which
this
case
differs
from
the
case
that
the
courts
might
usually
be
presented.
first,
the
case
is
different
in
the
nature
of
the
interest
which
is
involved,
and
in
the
extent
to
which
personal
determination
is
undermined
by
this
statute
-
the
effect
that
it
has
on
women.
second,
it
is
unique
in
the
type
of
injury
that's
presented.
certainly
there
are
some
injuries
that
can
be
compensated,
and
most
last
over
a
sufficient
period
of
time
for
the
courts
to
litigate
the
interest.
but
in
this
case,
a
progressing
pregnancy
does
not
suspend
itself
in
order
to
give
the
courts
time
to
act.
certainly
jane
roe
brought
her
suit
as
soon
as
she
knew
she
was
pregnant.
as
soon
as
she
had
sought
an
abortion,
and
then
denied,
she
came
to
federal
court.
she
came
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
women.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
that
women
in
texas
continued
to
desire
abortions,
and
to
seek
them
out
outside
our
state.
there
was
an
absence
of
any
other
remedy,
and
without
the
ability
to
litigate
her
claim
as
a
pregnant
woman
who
came
seeking
relief
and
who
was
affected
by
the
time
required
by
the
federal
process;
not
because
of
any
infirmity
in
her
own
attempt
to
litigate
her
interests
that
this
will,
in
fact,
be
a
case
certainly
presenting
substantial
federal
question,
and
yet
awaiting
review
in
the
future.
i
think
the
third
way
in
which
it
is
unique
is,
as
i
have
stated
the
fact
that
it
is
the
only
forum
available
to
these
women.
they
have
no
other
way
to
litigate
their
interests
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor.
declaratory
judgments
in
the
state
of
texas
are
limited
to
a
situation
where
property
rights
are
involved.
and
we
also
have
a
very
unusual
situation
in
texas,
where
we
have
two
concurrent
jurisdictions,
one
the
civil
and
one
the
criminal.
and
even
--
there
are
some
cases
which
indicate
that
our
state
supreme
court
would
not
have
the
ability
to
mandamus
any
of
the
criminal
prosecution
officers
because
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
jurisdiction
as
to
all
criminal
matters
in
the
state
of
texas.
so,
even
if
the
woman
had
been
able
to
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
--
which
she
couldn't
--
she
couldn't
have
gotten
any
sort
of
relief
against
future
prosecutions.
and
it
was
exactly
the
absence
of
the
court
granting
an
injunction
against
future
prosecutions
which
had
resulted
in
the
irreparable
injuries
these
women
have
suffered.
in
texas,
the
woman
is
the
victim.
the
state
cannot
deny
the
effect
that
this
law
has
on
the
women
of
texas.
certainly
there
are
problems
regarding
even
the
use
of
contraception.
abortion
now,
for
a
woman,
is
safer
than
childbirth.
in
the
absence
of
abortions,
or
legal
medically
safe
abortions-women
often
result
to
the
illegal
abortions,
which
certainly
carry
risks
of
death,
all
the
side
effects
such
as
severe
infections,
permanent
sterility,
all
the
complications
that
result.
and,
in
fact,
if
the
woman
is
unable
to
get
either
a
legal
abortion
or
an
illegal
abortion
in
our
state,
she
can
do
a
self-abortion,
which
is
certainly,
perhaps,
by
far
the
most
dangerous.
and
that
is
no
crime.
she
is
in
our
state
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
excuse
me,
your
honor.
thank
you.
texas,
for
example,
it
appears
to
us,
would
not
allow
any
relief
at
all,
even
in
situations
where
the
mother
would
suffer
perhaps
serious
physical
or
mental
harm.
there
is
certainly
a
great
question
about
it.
if
the
pregnancy
would
result
in
the
birth
of
a
deformed
or
defective
child,
she
has
no
relief.
regardless
of
the
circumstances
of
conception,
whether
it
was
because
of
rape,
incest,
whether
she
is
extremely
immature,
she
has
no
relief.
i
think
it's
without
question
that
pregnancy
to
a
woman
can
completely
disrupt
her
life.
whether
she's
unmarried;
whether
she's
pursuing
an
education;
whether
she's
pursuing
a
career;
whether
she
has
family
problems;
all
of
the
problems
of
personal
and
family
life,
for
a
woman,
are
bound
up
in
the
problem
of
abortion.
for
example,
in
our
state
there
are
many
schools
where
a
woman
is
forced
to
quit
if
she
becomes
pregnant.
in
the
city
of
austin
that
is
true.
a
woman,
if
she
becomes
pregnant,
and
is
in
high
school,
must
drop
out
of
regular
education
process.
and
that's
true
of
some
colleges
in
our
state.
in
the
matter
of
employment,
she
often
is
forced
to
quit
at
an
early
point
in
her
pregnancy.
she
has
no
provision
for
maternity
leave.
she
cannot
get
unemployment
compensation
under
our
laws,
because
the
laws
hold
that
she
is
not
eligible
for
employment,
being
pregnant,
and
therefore
is
eligible
for
no
unemployment
compensation.
at
the
same
time,
she
can
get
no
welfare
to
help
her
at
a
time
but
she
has
no
unemployment
compensation
and
she's
not
eligible
for
any
help
in
getting
a
job
to
provide
for
herself.
there
is
no
duty
for
employers
to
rehire
women
if
they
must
drop
out
to
carry
a
pregnancy
to
term.
and,
of
course,
this
is
especially
hard
on
the
many
women
in
texas
who
are
heads
of
their
own
households
and
must
provide
for
their
already
existing
children.
and,
obviously,
the
responsibility
of
raising
a
child
is
a
most
serious
one,
and
at
times
an
emotional
investment
that
must
be
made,
cannot
be
denied.
so,
a
pregnancy
to
a
woman
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
determinative
aspects
of
her
life.
it
disrupts
her
body.
it
disrupts
her
education.
it
disrupts
her
employment.
and
it
often
disrupts
her
entire
family
life.
and
we
feel
that,
because
of
the
impact
on
the
woman,
this
certainly
and
as
far
as
there
are
any
rights
which
are
fundamental
is
a
matter
which
is
of
such
fundamental
and
basic
concern
to
the
woman
involved
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
make
the
choice
as
to
whether
to
continue
or
to
terminate
her
pregnancy.
i
think
the
question
is
equally
serious
for
the
physicians
of
our
state.
they
are
seeking
to
practice
medicine
in
what
they
consider
the
highest
method
of
practice.
we
have
affidavits
in
the
back
of
our
brief
from
each
of
the
heads
of
public
of
heads
of
obstetrics
and
gynecology
departments
from
each
of
our
public
medical
schools
in
texas.
and
each
of
them
points
out
that
they
were
willing
and
interested
to
immediately
begin
to
formulate
methods
of
providing
care
and
services
for
women
who
are
pregnant
and
do
not
desire
to
continue
the
pregnancy.
they
were
stopped
cold
in
their
efforts,
even
with
the
declaratory
judgment,
because
of
the
da's
position
that
they
would
continue
to
prosecute.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
your
honors,
in
the
lower
court,
as
i'm
sure
you're
aware,
the
court
held
that
the
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
continue
a
pregnancy
rested
upon
the
ninth
amendment
which,
of
course,
reserves
those
rights
not
specifically
enumerated
to
the
government,
to
the
people.
i
think
it
is
important
to
note,
in
a
law
review
article
recently
submitted
to
the
court
and
distributed
among
counsel
by
professor
cyril
means,
jr.,
entitled
"the
phoenix
of
abortional
freedom,"
that
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted
there
was
no
common
law
prohibition
against
abortions;
that
they
were
available
to
the
women
of
this
country.
certainly,
under
the
griswold
decision,
it
appears
that
the
members
of
the
court
in
that
case
were
obviously
divided
as
to
the
specific
constitutional
framework
of
the
right
which
they
held
to
exist
in
the
griswold
decision.
i'm
a
little
reluctant
to
aspire
to
a
wisdom
that
the
court
was
not
in
agreement
on.
i
do
feel
that
the
ninth
amendment
is
an
appropriate
place
for
the
freedom
to
rest.
i
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
equally
an
appropriate
place,
under
the
rights
of
persons
to
life,
liberty,
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness.
i
think
that
in
as
far
as
"liberty"
is
meaningful,
that
liberty
to
these
women
would
mean
liberty
from
being
forced
to
continue
the
unwanted
pregnancy.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
we
had
originally
brought
this
suit
alleging
both
the
due
process
clause,
equal
protection
clause,
the
ninth
amendment,
and
a
variety
of
others.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
right.
since
that
district
court
found
the
right
to
reside
in
the
ninth
amendment,
we
pointed
our
attention
in
the
brief
to
that
particular
aspect
of
the
constitution.
but
i
think
we
would
not
presume
--
i
do
feel
that
in-so-much
as
members
of
the
court
can
say
that
the
ninth
amendment
applies
to
rights
reserved
to
the
people,
and
those
which
were
most
important-and
certainly
this
is
that
the
ninth
amendment
is
appropriate
place
insofar
as
the
court
has
said
that
life,
liberty,
in
a
pursuit
of
happiness
involved
the
most
fundamental
things
of
people;
that
this
matter
is
one
of
those
most
fundamental
matters.
i
think,
in
as
far
as
the
court
has
said
that
there
is
a
penumbra
that
exists
to
encompass
the
entire
purpose
of
the
constitution,
that
i
think
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
constitution
was
to
guarantee
to
the
individual
the
right
to
determine
the
course
of
their
own
lives.
insofar
as
there
was,
perhaps,
no
compelling
state
interest
and
we
allege
there
is
none
in
this
case
that,
there
again,
that
the
right
fits
within
the
framework
of
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
sir,
your
honor.
no,
sir,
there
is
not.
the
only
legislative
history,
of
course,
is
that
which
is
found
in
other
states
which
has
been
pointed
out
to
the
court
before
-
and,
as
professor
means
points
out
again,
that
these
statutes
were
adopted
for
the
health
of
the
mother.
certainly,
the
texas
courts
have
referred
to
the
woman
as
being
the
victim,
and
they
have
never
referred
to
anyone
else
as
being
the
victim.
concepts
have
certainly
changed.
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
in
texas
self-abortion
is
no
crime.
the
woman
is
guilty
of
no
crime,
even
though
she
seeks
out
the
doctor;
even
though
she
consents;
even
though
she
participates;
even
though
she
pays
for
the
procedure.
she,
again,
is
guilty
of
no
crime
whatsoever.
it's
also
interesting
that
in
our
statutes
--
the
penalty
for
the
offense
of
abortion
depends
on
whether
or
not
the
consent
of
the
woman
was
obtained
prior
to
the
procedure.
it's
double
if
you
don't
get
her
consent.
there
is
no
indication
in
fondgren
v.
state,
for
example,
the
court
ruled
that
a
woman
who
commits
an
abortion
on
herself
is
guilty
of
no
crime.
again,
"she"
being
regarded
as
the
victim,
rather
than
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime.
obviously,
in
our
state,
the
offense
is
not
murder.
it
is
an
abortion,
which
carries
a
significantly
lesser
offense.
there
is
no
requirement
of
--
even
though
the
state,
in
its
brief,
points
out
the
development
of
the
fetus
that
in
an
eight-week
period,
the
same
state,
does
not
require
any
death
certificate,
or
any
formalities
of
birth.
the
product
of
such
a
conception
would
be
handled
merely
as
a
pathological
specimen.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
time
limit
or
indication
of
time,
whatsoever.
so
i
think.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
sir.
i
do.
i
feel
that
the
question
of
a
time
limit
is
not
strictly
before
the
court,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
situation
in
which
the
case
is
handled.
certainly
i
think,
as
a
practical
matter
though,
most
of
the
states
that
do
have
some
time
limit
indicated
still
permit
abortions
beyond
the
time
limit
for
specified
reasons,
usually
where
the
health
of
the
mother
is
involved.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
as
to
a
time
limit.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
is
our
position
that
the
freedom
involved
is
that
of
a
woman
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
continue
a
pregnancy.
obviously
i
have
a
much
more
difficult
time
saying
that
the
state
has
no
interest
in
late
pregnancy.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
think
it
is
more
the
emotional
response
to
a
late
pregnancy
rather
than
it
is
any
constitutional.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
guess
by
persons
considering
the
issue
outside
the
legal
context.
i
think,
as
far
as
the
state.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
would
say
the
constitutional.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
the
constitution,
as
i
read
it,
and
as
interpreted
and
as
documented
by
professor
means,
attaches
protection
to
the
person
at
the
time
of
birth.
those
persons
born
are
citizens.
the
enumeration
clause,
we
count
those
people
who
are
born.
the
constitution,
as
i
see
it,
gives
protection
to
people
after
birth.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
sir.
certainly,
in
your
dissent,
you
pointed
out
in
perez
v.
ledesma,
not
a
concurring
opinion.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
was
a
dissent.
that
there
are
different
standards
that
apply
to
the
declaratory
judgment,
and
to
injunctive
relief.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
that
is
correct.
and
that's
what
the
court
said,
following
zwickler
v.
koota,
that
even
though
they
were
granting
declaratory
relief,
different
considerations
applied
as
to
injunctive
relief.
but
it
seems
that
the
opinions
of
this
court
have
established
that
where
there
is
great
and
immediate
threat
of
irreparable
injury,
with
no
adequate
remedy
in
state
court,
that
an
injunction
is
still
proper.
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
great
and
immediate
threat
of
irreparable
injury
in
the
form
of
a
continuing
pregnancy
that
will
not
abate,
and
that
continues.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
the
doctor,
as
i
said,
was
asking
no
relief
as
to
the
pending
prosecution.
he
was
only
asking
relief
as
to
future
prosecutions.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor.
he
joined
in
both
the
request
for
the
declaratory
judgment.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
where
there
were
pending
--.
samuels
v.
mackell,
as
i
read
it,
did
say
that
where
you
have
a
request
for
a
declaratory
judgment
there
would
be
an
effect
on
a
pending
criminal
prosecution.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
there
was
one
pending
when
this
action
was
brought,
those
against
dr.
hallford.
however,
in
this
case
we
submit
that
if
there
is
to
be
any
meaning
to
the
federal
courts
as
the
supreme
arbiters
of
constitutional
rights,
that
they
must
be
able
to
act,
at
least
in
some
form,
when
there
are
pending
criminal
prosecutions
--
not
particularly
against
the
person
involved
in
the
prosecution,
but
others.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor.
but
again
as
i
understood
it—
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i'm
suggesting
that
in
this
case
the
women
in
particular
brought
a
declaratory
action
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
pending
state
criminal
prosecution.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
and
that
the
intervention
of
the
doctor
certainly
should
not
be
sufficient.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
right.
that
because
the
doctor
intervened
when
he
was
asking
no
relief
as
to
the
pending
state
criminal
prosecution,
that
his
intervention
--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that's
correct.
he
is
willing
to
litigate
his
interest.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
as
to
future
prosecution.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
and
which
your
dissent
said
was
incorrect.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
was
a
dissent,
okay.
i
think
perhaps
we
would
stress
that
there
are
two
separate
actions
before
the
court
first,
that
of
the
women;
and,
second,
that
of
the
doctor.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
even
though
the
court
might
find
that
the
doctor
was
an
inappropriate
party
for
relief,
it
certainly
would
not
effect
the
original
action
as
brought
by
the
women.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
because
they
are
still
subject
to
the
irreparable
injury,
and
have
no
adequate
state
remedy.
and,
if
they
are
not
able
to
continue
to
litigate
their
interest
in
this
situation,
any
time
there
was
any
prosecution
pending
against
anyone
in
the
state,
at
any
point
in
the
appeal-for
example,
the
thompson
case
was
filed
in
1968.
it's
been
decided
now
in
our
state
courts.
it's
on
appeal,
or
it
will
be
appealed
here,
i
think.
and,
certainly
if
they
cannot
litigate
their
interests
while
there
is
a
prosecution
pending
against
the
doctor,
they
will
--
in
many
instances
where
a
statute—
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes.
they
cannot
even
decide
to
take
the
risk
for
themselves
under
the
declaratory
judgment.
they
must
rely
on
another
person
to
take
that
risk.
but,
certainly,
the
doctor
raised
not
only
his
own
rights,
but
the
rights
of
his
patients.
and
those
same
patients
are
suffering
the
same
sort
of
irreparable
injury
that
the
original
plaintiffs
were
suffering.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor,
he
can.
but
i
don't
feel
it's
appropriate
to
make
those
women
who
are
most
vitally
affected
certainly
more
so
than
the
doctor,
who
can
merely
decide
not
to
perform
an
abortion,
and
thereby
escape
--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor.
my
point
being
that
these
women
should
not
be
compelled
to
leave
it
up
to
a
doctor
to
litigate
those
interests.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
well,
i
think
there
are
different
interests
involved.
and
in
most
criminal
prosecutions
the
doctors
would
bring
up
other
problems,
such
as
--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes.
or
the
witnesses
disappeared,
or
it
really
was
for
this
reason,
in
this
particular
case.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
one
recent
opinion,
thompson
v.
the
state
of
texas,
which
the
attorney
general
attempted
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
and
it
was
not
printed,
and
the
court
rejected
it.
but
it
was
a
decision
about
a
month-and-a-half
ago
which
originated
in
houston.
a
doctor
there
was
indicted
on
a
charge
of
abortion.
at
trial
he
used
only
an
alibi
defense.
but
on
his
appeal
he
did
raise
the
same
constitutional
questions
that
we
raised
in
the
federal
courts.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
your
honor,
they
could
have,
but
they
didn't.
they
went
ahead
and
litigated
those
issues,
and
our
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals-which
is
our
highest
court-has
now
held
that
the
statute
is
not
vague,
citing
vuitch,
which,
again,
i
would
contend
is
an
incorrect
reliance.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
and,
second,
they
did
not
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
right
to
privacy;
but
did
hold
there
was
a
compelling
interest.
so,
in
that
particular
situation,
which
is
the
only
situation,
a
doctor
did
attempt
to
litigate
the
same
issues—
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
they
have
held,
really,
directly
in
opposition
to
the
federal
court
opinion
from
which
we
are
appealing.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
they
have
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing
in
the
state
court
of
criminal
appeals,
which
will
be
argued
tomorrow.
i
think
it's
very
unlikely
that
the
court
would
change
its
opinion,
and
it
is
the
intention
of
those
parties
to
appeal.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
your
honor,
only
if
they
are
born
alive.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
recently
has
held
in
one
case
that
there
is
an
action
for
prenatal
injuries
at
any
stage
prior
to
birth,
but
only
upon
the
condition
that
it
be
born
alive.
the
same
is
true
of
our
property
law.
the
child
must
be
born
alive.
and
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
those
children
which
are
ultimately
born;
and
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
give
them
retroactive
rights.
but
i
think
that's
a
completely
different
question
from
whether
or
not
they
had
rights
at
the
time
they
were
still
in
the
womb
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
there
had
been
no
situation
litigated
like
that
in
texas.
i
suppose
you
noted
that
the
--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
the
iowa
supreme
court
about
two
weeks
ago
held
that
where
it
was
stillborn
there
was
no
cause
of
action
whatsoever
--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
oh,
i
am
speaking-excuse
me,
solely
for
the
fetus;
that
the
fetus
had
no
independent
right;
that
the
mother
--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
only
for
her
injury.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
your
honor.
thank
you.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
your
honor,
i
would
only
like
to
draw
to
the
court's
attention
at
page
130
of
the
record,
the
notice
of
appeal
by
defendant
state
of
texas,
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
they
have
filed
an
appeal
in
this
court.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
once
again
before
this
court
to
ask
relief
against
the
continued
enforcement
of
the
texas
abortion
statute
and
ask
that
you
affirm
the
ruling
of
the
three-judge
court
below
which
held
our
statute
unconstitutional
for
two
reasons,
the
first,
that
it
was
vague
and,
the
second,
that
it
interfered
with
the
ninth
amendment
right
for
a
woman
to
determine
whether
or
not
she
would
continue
or
terminate
her
pregnancy.
as
you
will
recall,
there
are
three--
four--
three
plaintiffs
and
one
intervener
involved
here.
the
first
plaintiff
was
jane
roe,
an
unmarried
pregnant
girl
who
had
sought
an
abortion
in
the
state
of
texas
and
was
denied
it
because
of
the
texas
abortion
statute
which
provides
an
abortion
is
lawful
only
for
the
purpose
of
saving
the
life
of
the
woman.
in
the
original
action,
she
was
joined
by
a
married
couple,
john
and
mary
doe.
mrs.
doe
had
a
medical
condition.
her
doctor
had
recommended
first
that
she
not
get
pregnant
and,
second,
that
she
not
take
the
pill.
after
this
cause
was
instituted
and
after,
in
fact,
the
three-judge
court
had
been
granted,
those
three
plaintiffs
were
joined
by
an
intervener,
doctor
hallford,
who
was,
at
the
time
he
intervened,
under
a
pending
state
criminal
prosecution
under
the
statute.
he
did
not
ask
that
his
prosecution
be
joined--
be
stopped
by
the
court
but,
rather,
joined
in
the
original
request
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
injunctive
relief
against
future
prosecutions.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
has
not--
his
prosecution
has
not
been
continued,
but
the
district
attorney,
against
whom
we
filed
a
suit,
has
taken
a
position
that
because
there
was
no
injunction
he
is
still
free
to
institute
prosecutions.
there
is
a
letter
from
his
office
in
the
appendix
stating
that
he
will
continue
prosecutions
and,
in
fact,
there
had
been
a
very
limited
number
of
prosecutions
instituted
in
the
state
of
texas
since
the
three-judge
court
entered
its
declaratory
judgment.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
prosecutions
of
doctors,
yes,
sir.
the
problem
that
we
face
in
texas
is
that
even
though
we
were
granted
a
declaratory
judgment
ruling
the
law
unconstitutional
and
even
though
we’ve
been
before
this
court
once
in
the
past,
in
texas,
women
still
are
not
able
to
receive
abortions
from
licensed
doctors
because
doctors
still
fear
that
they
will
be
prosecuted
under
the
statute.
so,
if
the
declaratory
judgment
was
any
relief
at
all,
it
was
an
almost
meaningful
relief
because
the
women
of
texas
still
must
either
travel
to
other
states,
if
they
are
that
sophisticated
and
can
afford
it,
or
they
must
resort
to
some
other
less--
some
other
very
undesirable
alternatives
and--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
it’s
just--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
in
fact,
we’ve
pointed
out
in
our
supplemental
brief
filed
here
that
there
had
been
something
like
1,600
texas
women
who
have
gone
to
new
york
city
alone
for
abortions
in
the
first
nine
months
of
1971.
in
addition,
i
think
the
court
would
recognize
there
are
many
women
going
to
other
parts
of
the
country.
one
of
the
objections
that
our
opponents
have
raised
is
saying
that
this
court
is
moot
because,
of
course,
the
woman
is
no
longer
pregnant.
it’s
been
almost
three
years
since
we
instituted
the
original
action
and,
yet,
we
can
certainly
show
that
it
is
a
continuing
problem
to
texas
women.
there
still
are
unwanted
pregnancies.
there
are
still
women
who,
for
various
reasons,
do
not
wish
to
continue
the
pregnancy
whether
because
of
personal
health
considerations,
whether
because
of
their
family
situation,
whether
because
of
financial
situations,
education,
working
situations,
some
of
the
many
things
we
discussed
in
the
last
hearing.
since
the
last
hearing
before
this
court,
there
have
been
a
few
cases
decided
that
we
wanted
to
draw
the
court’s
attention
to
and
are
covered
in
our
supplemental
brief.
in
addition,
there
is
a
supplemental
brief
filed
by
an
amicus
party,
harriet
pilpel
on
behalf
of
planned
parenthood
of
new
york,
that
seeks
to
point
out
to
the
court
at
pages
6
and
7,
subsequent
pages,
some
of
the
changing
medical
statistics
available
regarding
the
procedure
of
abortion.
for
example,
that
brief
points
out
that
the
overall
maternal
death
rate
from
legal
abortion
in
new
york
dropped
to
3.7
per
100,000
abortions
in
the
last
half
of
1971
and
that,
in
fact,
is
less
than
half
of
the
death
rate
associated
with
live
delivery
for
women.
that,
in
fact,
the
maternal
morbidity--
mortality
rate
has
decreased
by
about
two-thirds
to
a
record
low
in
new
york
in
1971.
that--
now,
in
1971,
new
york
recorded
the
lowest
infant
mortality
rate
ever
in
that
state.
that
during
the
first
18
months
of
19--
well,
from
july
1,
1970
to
december
31,
1971,
out
of
wedlock
pregnancies
have
dropped
about
14%.
we
now
have
other
statistics
coming
from
california
and
other
states
that
show
that
not
only
has
the
overall
birthrate
declined,
but
the
welfare
birthrate
has
also
declined
accordingly.
as
to
the
women,
this
is
their
only
forum.
they
are
in
a
very
unique
situation
for
several
reasons.
first,
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
interest
involved,
their
primary
interest
being
the
interest
associated
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
will
be
forced
by
the
state
to
continue
an
unwanted
pregnancy.
in
our
original
brief,
we
alleged
a
number
of
constitutional
grounds.
the
main
one
that
we
are
relying
on
before
this
court
are
the
fifth,
ninth,
and
the
fourteenth
amendments.
there’s
a
great
body
of
precedent.
certainly,
we
cannot
say
that
there
isn’t
a
constitution
so
stated
the
right
to
abortion
but,
neither
is
there
stated
the
right
to
travel
or
some
of
the
other
basic
rights
that
this
court
have
held
are
under
the
united
states
constitution.
the
court
has
in
the
past,
for
example,
held
that
it
is
the
right
of
the
parents
and
not
of
the
individual
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
will
send
their
child
to
private
school,
whether
or
not
their
children
will
be
taught
foreign
languages,
whether
or
not
they
will
have
offspring
in
the
skinner
case,
whether
the
right
to
determine
for
themselves
whom
they
will
marry
in
the
loving
case,
and
even
in
body
versus
connecticut
the
choice
saying
that
marriage
itself
is
so
important
that
the
state
cannot
interfere
with
termination
of
a
marriage
just
because
the
woman
is
unable
to
pay
the
cost.
griswold,
of
course,
is
the
primary
case
holding
that
the
state
could
not
interfere
in
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
married
couple
would
use
birth
control
and,
since
then,
the
courts
have--
this
court,
of
course,
has
held
that
the
individual
has
the
right
to
determine
whether
they
are
married
or
single,
whether
they
would
use
birth
control.
so,
there
is
a
great
body
of
cases
decided
in
the
past
by
this
court
in
the
areas
of
marriage,
sex,
contraception,
procreation,
childbearing,
and
education
of
children
which
says
that
there
are
certain
things
that
are
so
much
part
of
the
individual
concern
that
they
should
be
left
to
the
determination
of
the
individual.
one
of
the
cases
decided
since
our
last
argument,
december
13,
was
the
second
connecticut
case,
abele
versus
markle,
which
judge--
excuse
me?
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
judge
newman
wrote
the
opinion,
yes.
thank
you.
and,
judge
lambert
concurred.
part
of
the
lang--
in
that
case,
that
three-judge
court
held
the
connecticut
statute,
a
slightly
revised
statute
for
the
second
time,
to
be
unconstitutional,
and
part
of
the
language
of
that
case
pointed
out
that
“no
decision
of
the
supreme
court
has
ever
permitted
anyone’s
constitutional
right
to
be
directly
abridged
to
protect
a
state
interest
which
is
subject
to
such
a
variety
of
personal
judgments”
and,
certainly,
the
amicus
brief
stag
before
the
court
showed
a
variety
of
personal
judgments
that
come
to
bear
on
this
particular
situation.
to
oppose
such
a
statute,
the
court
said,
would
be
to
permit
the
state
to
impose
its
view
of
the
nature
of
a
fetus
upon
those
who
have
the
constitutional
right
to
base
an
important
decision
in
their
personal
lives
upon
a
different
view.
again,
this
is
a
very
special
type
case
for
the
women
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
injury
involved.
it
is
an
irreparable
injury.
once
pregnancy
has
started,
certainly
this
is
not
the
kind
of
injury
that
can
be
later
adjudicated.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
injury
that
can
later
be
compensated
by
some
sort
of
monetary
reward.
these
women
who
have
now
gone
through
pregnancy
and
the
women
who
continue
to
be
forced
to
go
through
pregnancy
have
certainly
gone
through
something
that
is
irreparable,
that
can
never
be
changed
for
them.
it
is
certainly
great
and
it
is
certainly
immediate.
there
is
no
other
forum
available
to
them.
as
we
talked
last
time,
they
are
not
subject
in
texas
to
any
kind
of
criminal
prosecution
whether
the
woman
performs
self-abortion,
whether
she
goes
to
a
doctor,
finds
someone
who
will
perform
it
on
her.
she
is
guilty
of
no
crime
whatsoever
and,
yet,
the
state
tries
to
allege
that
its
purpose
in
the
statute
was
to
protect
the
fetus.
if
that’s
true,
the
fact
the
woman
is
guilty
of
no
crime
is
not
a
reasonable
kind
of--
it
does
not
reasonably
follow.
these--
the
women
are
not
able
to
have
any
kind
of
declaratory
judgment
in
texas
because
of
our
special
declaratory
judgment
statutes
and
our
concurring
criminal
and
civil
courts,
the
two
different
kinds
of
cases
that
we
have.
so,
the
federal
court
was
the
only
court
to
which
the
women
had
any
kind
of
access,
and
it
was
to
the
federal
courts
they
came,
and
it’s
the
federal
court,
in
my
judgment,
that
should
determine
this
case.
it’s
a
very
unique
kind
of
harm,
certainly,
that
was
done
to
them.
even
though
there
are
many
cases,
some
very
recent
from
this
court,
talking
about
the
problem
of
when
a
state
may
interfere
when
they’re--
or
the
federal
judiciary
may
interfere
when
there
is
a
pending
state
criminal
prosecution.
this
case
does
come
under
the
exceptions
in
that
there
is
great,
immediate,
irreparable
injury
where
there
is
no
other
forum.
it
is
something
that,
as
far
as
these
women
are
concerned,
can
never
be
adjudicated
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
much
less
in
a
single
criminal
prosecution.
it
certainly
is
an
instance
of
a
situation
that
is
capable
of
repetition,
yet,
evading
review.
the
judiciary
simply
does
not
move
fast
enough
for
the
case
to
be
decided
within
the
period
of
gestation,
much
less
within
the
period
within
which
an
abortion
would
be
medically
safe
for
these
women.
the
state
has
alleged
and
it’s
only
alleged
interest
in
the
statute
is
the
interest
in
protecting
the
life
of
the
unborn.
however,
the
state
has
not
been
able
to
point
to
any
authority
of
any
nature
whatsoever
that
would
demonstrate
that
this
statute
was,
in
fact,
adopted
for
that
purpose.
we
have
some
indication
that
other
state
statutes
were
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
health
of
the
woman.
we
have
an
1880
case
in
texas,
shortly
after
the
1854
statute
was
adopted,
that
states
that
a
woman
is
the
victim
of
the
crime
and
is
the
only
victim
the
court
talks
about.
we
have
all
the
contradictions
in
the
statute
in
the
way--
so
many
things
that
just
don’t
make
sense.
if
the
statute
was
adopted
for
that
purpose,
for
example,
why
is
the
woman
guilty
of
no
crime?
if
the
statute
was
adopted
for
that
purpose,
why
is
it
that
the
penalty
for
abortion
is
determined
by
whether
or
not
you
have
the
woman’s
consent?
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that’s
correct.
there
had
been
two
cases
decided
since
the
december
13
argument
that
expressly
hold
that
a
fetus
has
no
constitutional
rights,
one
being
byrn
versus
new
york,
and
the
other
being
the
magee-womens
hospital
cases.
in
both
situations,
a
person
sought
to
bring
that
very
question
to
the
court
does
in
the
one
instance,
byrn,
was
a
challenge
to
the
new
york
revised
statute,
the
other
was
a
situation
where
a
person
sought
to
prevent
magee-womens
hospital
from
allowing
further
abortions
to
be
done
in
that
hospital.
and,
in
both
cases,
it
was
held
that
the
fetus
had
no
constitutional
rights.
several
of
the
briefs
before
this
court
would
also
argue
that
this
court
in
deciding
the
vuitch
case
which
has
allowed
abortions
to
continue
in
the
district
of
columbia,
certainly
the
court
would
not
have
made
that
kind
of
decision
if
it
felt
there
were
any
ingrained
rights
of
the
fetus
within
the
constitution.
there
had
also--
there
is
also,
of
course--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
critical
first
that
we
prove
this
is
a
fundamental
interest
on
behalf
of
the
woman,
that
it
is
a
constitutional
right
and,
second--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
okay
and,
second,
that
the
state
has
no
compelling
state
interest.
okay,
and
the
state
is
alleging
a
compelling
state
interest.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
all
of
the
cases,
the
prior
history
of
this
statute,
the
common
law
history
would
indicate
that
it
is
not.
the
state
has
shown
no--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
then
you
would
have
a
balancing
of
interests.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
excuse
me?
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
seems
to
me
that
you
do
not
balance
constitutional
rights
of
one
person
against
mere
statutory
rights
of
another.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
think--
it
would
seem
to
me
that--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
if
the
state
could
show
that
the
fetus
was
a
person
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
under
some
other
amendment
or
part
of
the
constitution,
then
you
would
have
the
situation
of
trying--
you
would
have
a
state
compelling
interest
which,
in
some
instances,
can
outweigh
a
fundamental
right.
this
is
not
the
case
in
this
particular
situation.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
our
statute
does
not.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
we
are
asking
in
this
case
that
the
court
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional,
the
state
having
proved
no
compelling
interest
at
all.
there
are
some
states
that
now
have
adopted
time
limits.
those
have
not
yet
been
challenged
and,
perhaps,
that
question
will
be
before
this
court.
even
those
statutes
though
allow
exceptions,
well,
for--
new
york,
for
example,
says
an
abortion
is
lawful
up
to
24
weeks,
but
even
after
the
24
weeks
it
is
still
lawful
where
there
is
rape
or
incest
or
where
the
mother’s
mental
or
physical
health
is
involved.
in
other
words,
even
after
that
period,
it’s
not
a
hard
and
fast
cutoff.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
the
legislature
and
in
that
situation
engaged
in
the
weighing
process,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
has
not
yet
been
determined
whether
the
state
has
the
compelling
state
interest
to
uphold
even
that
kind
of
regulation,
but
that’s
really
not
before
the
court
in
this
particular
case.
we
have
no
time
limit.
there
is
no
indication
in
texas
that
any
would
be
applied
in
any
future
date.
you
know,
we
just
don’t
know
that.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that’s
correct.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
our--texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
thompson
versus
state--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
in
november
or
last--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
it--
that
particular
case
held
that
the
texas
statute
was
not
vague
citing
vuitch.
it’s
my
opinion
that
that
reliance
was
misplaced.
that,
in
vuitch,
this
court
had
before
it
the
d.c.
statute
which
allowed
abortion
for
the
purpose
of
saving
the
life
or
the
health,
and
this
court
adopted
the
interpretation
that
health
meant
both
mental
and
physical
health.
and,
it
seem
to
me,
the
court’s
language
in
that
case
talked
a
great
deal
about
the
fact
that
the
doctor’s
judgment
goes
to
saving
the
health
of
the
woman,
that
that’s
the
kind
of
judgment
that
he
is
used
to
making.
in
texas,
that’s
not
the
judgment
he
is
forced
to
make.
the
judgment
in
texas
is,
is
this
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
the
life
of
the
woman,
and
the
language
of
that
statute
has
never
been
interpreted.
that’s
not
the
kind
of
judgment
that
a
doctor
is
accustomed
or
perhaps
even
able
to
make.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
still
continue
the
argument
that
the
texas
case
is
vague.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
okay.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
am.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
think
two
things
could
be
said.
the
first
would
be
that
situations
and
understandings
change.
in
this
case,
for
example,
we
have
before
the
court
a
medical
amicus
brief
that
was
joined
by
all
of
the
deans
of
the
public
medical
schools
in
texas.
it
was
joined
by
numerous
other
professors
of
medicine.
it
was
joined
by
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists.
you
know--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
none
of
theirs
is--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
okay.
i
guess
it
was--
okay,
in
part,
because
the
hippocratic
oath,
we
discuss
basically
the
constitutional
protection
we
felt
the
woman
to
have.
the
hippocratic
oath
does
not
pertain
to
that.
second,
we
discuss
the
fact
that
the
state
had
not
established
a
compelling
state
interest.
the
hippocratic
oath
would
not
really
pertain
to
that.
and
then,
we
discuss
the
vagueness
jurisdiction.
it
seem
to
us
that
that--
that
the
fact
that
the
medical
profession,
at
one
time,
had
adopted
the
hippocratic
oath
does
not
weight
upon
the
fundamental
constitutional
rights
involved.
it
is
a
guide
for
physicians,
but
the
outstanding
organizations
of
the
medical
profession
have,
in
fact,
adopted
a
position
that
says
the
doctor
and
the
patient
should
be
able
to
make
the
decision
for
themselves
in
this
kind
of
situation.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
well,
i
guess
you--
it
is
old,
and
not
that
it’s
out
of
date,
but
it
seemed
to
us
that
it
was
not
pertinent
to
the
argument
we
were
making.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
sir.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
think
had
there
been
established
that
the
fetus
was
a
person
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
under
constitutional
protection
then
there
might
be
a
differentiation.
in
this
case,
there
has
never
been
established
that
the
fetus
is
a
person
or
that
it’s
entitled
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
or
the
protection
of
the
constitution.
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
decide
that,
after
birth,
various
classifications
of
persons
would
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty
or
not
but,
here,
we
have
a
person,
the
woman,
entitled
to
fundamental
constitutional
rights
as
opposed
to
the
fetus
prior
to
birth
where
there
is
no
establishment
of
any
kind
of
federal
constitutional
rights.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
depends
on
saying
that
the
woman
has
a
fundament
constitutional
right
and
that
the
state
has
not
proved
any
compelling
interest
for
regulation
in
the
area.
even
if
the
court,
at
some
point,
determined
the
fetus
to
be
entitled
to
constitutional
protection,
you
would
still
get
back
into
the
weighing
of
one
life
against
another.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
your
honor.
i
said
that
would
be
what
would
be
involved
if
the
facts
were
different
and
the
state
could
prove
that
there
was
a
person
for
the
constitutional
right.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
would
have
a
very
difficult
case.
[laughter]
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that’s
right.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that’s
correct.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
your
honor.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
do
not
believe
that
the
state
legislature
can
determine
the
meaning
of
the
federal
constitution.
it
is
up
to
this
court
to
make
that
determination.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
the
state--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
the
state
could
obviously
adopt
that
kind
of
statute
and
then
the
question
would
have
to
be
adjudicated
as
to
whether,
for
all
purposes,
that
statute
is
constitutional.
we
are
not
alleging
that
there
cannot
be
some
kind
of
protection.
for
example,
the
property
rights
which,
again,
are
contingent
on
being—upon
being
born
alive
that
can
be
retroactive
to
the
period
prior
to
birth,
but
in
this
particular
situation,
we
are
alleging
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that
is
only
when
they
are
born
alive,
and
the
fact
that
there
is
a
wrong—the
wrongful
conduct
of
another
is
not
the
same
in
this
situation.
as
to
property
rights,
for
example,
there
are
even
property
rights
that
relate
back
to
prior
to
conception,
children
that
are
not
yet
conceived
can
later
inherit.
but,
that
doesn’t—that
did
not
prevent
this
court
in
griswold
from
holding
people
had
the
right
to
birth
control.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
mr.
flowers
well
made
the
point
when
he
said
that
no
one
can
say
here
is
the
dividing
line,
here
is
where
life
begins,
here
is--
life
is
here
and
life
is
not
over
here.
in
a
situation
where
no
one
can
prove
where
life
begins,
where
no
one
can
show
that
the
constitution
was
adopted,
that
it
was
meant
to
protect
fetal
life,
in
those
situations
where
it
is
shown
that
that
kind
of
decision
is
so
fundamentally
a
part
of
individual
life
of
het
family,
of
such
fundamental
impact
on
the
person--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
at
this--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
at
this
time,
my
point
is
that
this
particular
statute
is
unconstitutional.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
at
this
time,
there
is
no
indication
to
show
that
the
constitution
would
give
any
protection
prior
to
birth.
that
is
not
before
the
court
and
that
is
the
question
i
think--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that’s
correct.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
seems
to
me,
in
this
situation,
the
court
is--
excuse
me,
i
must--
would
you
ask
the
question
again?
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
you
mean
if
the
state,
in
fact,
did
that?
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
would
still
be
void
on
its
face
in
this
situation
because
it
is
overly
broad.
it
interferes
in
a--
at
a
time
when
a
state
has
no--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
in
areas
where--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
well--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
my
argument
would,
first,
be
that
it’s
void
on
its
face
and,
second,
if
the
court
finds
it’s
not
void
on
its
face
then
it
certainly
is
void
because
it
infringes
upon
the
fundamental
right
at
a
time
when
the
state
can
show
no
compelling
interest
early
in
pregnancy.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
there,
you
said
the
particular
d.c.
statute
was
not
void
for
vagueness.
it’s
a
different
statute.
there
was
an
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
the
court
there
said
the
doctor
could
work
within
that
context
and
could
tell
what
the
statute
meant.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that’s
correct,
which
makes
it
much
more
difficult
for
the
doctor
to
tell
when
it
is
const--
when
he
can
act.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
including--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
mental
and
physical.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
but
then
the
question
is
raised
as
to
the
right
of
privacy
which
was
not
before
the
court
in
the
vuitch
case
and
is
before
the
court
in
this
particular
situation.
as
to
the
hippocratic
oath,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
oath
was
adopted
at
a
time
when
abortion
was
extremely
dangerous
to
the
health
of
the
woman
and,
second,
that
the
oath
is
to
protect
life.
and,
here,
the
question
is
what
does
life
mean
in
this
particular
context?
it’s
the
sort
of
same
vagueness
that
it
seems
to
me
that
your--
well,
okay,
life
there
could
be
slightly
different
because
of
the
constitutional
implications
here.
it
seems
to
me
that--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
to
providing
abortions.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that’s
correct.
as
to
mutilation,
there,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
purpose
of
those
statutes
was
to
prevent
the
citizen
from
becoming
a
dependent
or
ward
of
the
state
and
also
to
ensure
that
its
citizens
would
be
available
for
service
in
the
military.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
rationale
works
just
the
opposite.
here,
a
woman,
because
of
her
pregnancy,
is
often
not
a
productive
member
of
society.
she
cannot
work.
she
cannot
hold
a
job.
she’s
not
eligible
for
welfare.
she
cannot
get
unemployment
compensation,
and
furthermore,
in
fact,
the
pregnancy
may
produce
a
child
who
will
become
a
ward
of
the
state.
we
do
not
object
to
the
cases
such
as
the
transfusion
case
where
there
is
a
decision
already
made
by
the
woman
that
she
desires
to
carry
the
pregnancy
to
term,
and
when
that
decision
is
made
that
the
child
should
be
given
every
opportunity
to
come
into
life
a
healthy
person.
we
do
not
believe
that
that
necessitates
the
conclusion
that,
therefore,
under
the
constitution
prior
to
birth
a
person
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
exist
there.
this
case--
this
court
is
faced
with
the
situation
where
there
have
been
14
three-judge
courts
that
ruled
on
the
constitutionality
of
abortion
statutes,
9
courts
have
favored
the
woman,
5
have
gone
against
her.
25
judges
have
favored
the
woman,
17
have
gone
against
her.
9
circuit
judges
have
favored
the
woman,
5
have
gone
against
her.
16
district
court
judges
have
favored
the
woman,
10
have
gone
against
her.
no
one
is
more
keenly
aware
of
the
gravity
of
the
issues
of
the
moral
implications
of
this
case,
but
it
is
a
case
that
must
be
decided
on
the
constitution.
we
do
not
disagree
that
there
is
a
progression
of
fetal
development.
it
is
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
that,
upon
which
we
disagree.
we
are
not
here
to
advocate
abortion.
we
do
not
ask
this
court
to
rule
that
abortion
is
good
or
desirable
in
any
particular
situation.
we
are
here
to
advocate
that
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
woman
will
continue
to
carry
or
will
terminate
a
pregnancy
is
a
decision
that
should
be
made
by
that
individual.
that,
in
fact,
she
has
a
constitutional
right
to
make
that
decision
for
herself
and
that
the
state
has
shown
no
interest
in
interfering
with
that
decision.
our
supplemental
brief
on
page
14
points
out
that
the
brief
of
the
opposition
can’t
quite
decide
when
life
does
begin.
at
one
point,
they
suggest
it’s
when
there’s
implantation.
a
few
pages
later,
they
suggest
it’s
with
conception.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
certainly,
your
honor,
he
may.
he
may
refuse
any
kind
of
medical
procedure
whatsoever.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
here,
it’s
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
by
the
statute
will
force
the
woman
to
continue.
the
woman
should
be
given
that
freedom,
just
as
the
doctor
has
the
freedom
to
decide
what
procedures
he
will
carry
out
and
what
he
will
refuse
to
his
patient.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
okay.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
am
urging
that,
in
this
particular
context,
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
that
in
the
baird
versus
eisenstadt
case,
this
court
said
if
the
right
of
privacy
is
to
mean
anything,
it
is
the
right
of
the
individual,
whether
married
or
single,
to
make
determinations
for
themselves.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
cannot
say
this
is
a
woman
of
this
particular
doctor
and
this
particular
woman.
it
is,
it
seems
to
me,
of--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
and
he
can
say,
“i’m
sorry,
i
don’t
perform
them.”
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
she
goes
elsewhere,
if
she
so
chooses.
if
she
stays
with
that--
you
know,
it’s--
that’s
an
impossible
question.
certainly,
i
don’t
think
the
state
could
say
the
first
doctor
a
woman
goes
to
shall
make
that
determination,
and
she
cannot
go
elsewhere.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
okay,
thank
you.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
instant
case
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
united
state
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
texas.
the
court
declared
the
texas
abortion
law
to
the
unconstitutional
for
two
reasons:
first,
that
the
law
was
impermissibly
vague,
and,
second,
that
it
violated
a
woman’s
right
to
continue
or
terminate
a
pregnancy.
although
the
court
granted
declaratory
relief,
the
court
denied
appellant’s
request
for
injunctive
relief.
the
texas
law
in
question
permits
abortions
to
be
performed
only
in
instances
where
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
saving
the
life
of
the
woman.
the
case
originated
with
the
filing
of
two
separate
complaints,
the
first
being
filed
on
behalf
of
jane
roe,
an
unmarried
pregnant
girl
and
the
second
being
filed
on
behalf
of
jane
and
mary
doe,
a
married
couple.
jane
roe,
the
pregnant
woman,
had
gone
to
several
dallas
physicians
seeking
an
abortion,
but
had
been
refused
care
because
of
the
texas
law.
she
filed
suit
on
behalf
of
herself
and
all
those
women
who
have
in
the
past
at
that
present
time
or
in
the
future
would
seek
termination
of
a
pregnancy.
in
her
affidavit
she
did
state
some
of
the
reasons
that
she
desired
an
abortion
at
the
time
she
sought
one.
but,
contrary
to
the
contentions
of
appellee,
she
continued
to
desire
the
abortion.
and
it
was
not
only
at
the
time
she
sought
the
abortion
that
her
desire
was
to
terminate
the
pregnancy.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that
is
correct.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
your
honor,
i
do
not.
in
the
vuitch
decision
this
court
was
working
with
a
statute
which
provided
that
an
abortion
could
be
performed
for
reasons
of
health
or
life.
our
texas
statute
provides
an
abortion
only
where
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
saving
the
life
of
the
woman.
since
the
vuitch
decision
was
rendered,
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
-which
is
our
highest
court
of
criminal
jurisdiction
has
held
that
the
texas
law
is
not
vague,
citing
the
vuitch
decision,
but
saying
that
the
texas
law
is
more
definite
than
the
d.c.
law.
so,
obviously
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
doesn't
feel
that
the
two
are
the
same.
and
in
the
vuitch
decision,
the
justices
of
this
court
emphasized
continuously
that
a
doctor,
as
a
matter
of
routine,
works
with
the
problem
of
what
is
best
for
the
health
of
his
patients.
we
submit
that
a
doctor
is
not
used
to
being
restricted
to
acting
only
when
it's
for
the
purpose
of
saving
the
life
of
the
woman,
and
that
health
is
a
continuum
which
runs
into
life.
and
a
doctor
in
our
state
does
not
know
whether
he
can
perform
an
abortion
only
when
death
is
imminent
or
when
the
woman's
life
would
be
shortened.
he
does
not
know
if
the
death
must
be
certain,
or
if
it
could
be
an
increase
in
probability
of
her
death.
so
here,
in
the
district,
doctors
are
able
to
exercise
their
normal
matter
of
judgment,
whether
or
not
the
health
of
the
woman,
mental
or
physical
will
be
affected.
but,
in
texas,
we
tell
the
doctor
that
unless
he
can
decide
whether
it's
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
saving
her
life,
and
for
no
other
reason,
that
he
is
subject
to
criminal
sanctions.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
the
range
of
problems
that
could
be
presented
to
a
doctor.
the
court,
for
example,
cited
the
instance
of
suicide,
if
a
woman
comes
in
alleging
that
she
will
commit
suicide.
is
it
then
necessary
for
him
to
do
or
can
he
do
an
abortion
for
the
purpose
of
saving
her
life?
or,
is
that
a
situation
where
he
has
to
have
something
more?
i
think
all
of
those
questions
cannot
be
answered,
at
this
point.
this
brings
up
the
married
couple
in
our
case.
the
woman
in
that
case
had
a
neurochemical
condition.
her
doctor
had
advised
her
not
to
get
pregnant,
and
not
to
take
the
birth
control
pills.
she
was
using
alternative
means
of
birth
control,
but
she
and
her
husband
were
fearful
that
she
would
become
pregnant
and
that,
although
the
neurochemical
condition
would
impair
her
health,
evidently
her
doctor
did
not
feel
that
she
would
die
if
she
continued
the
pregnancy.
and
certainly
they
were
very
concerned
about
the
effect
of
the
statute,
and
her
physician
seemed
uncertain
about
its
implications.
the
doctors
in
our
state
continue
to
feel
that
our
law
is
vague.
certainly,
we
introduced
affidavits
in
the
lower
court
to
that
effect.
since
the
time
of
the
lower
court
ruling,
the
district
attorney
in
texas
has
said
that
he
considers
the
federal
court
decision
there
not
to
be
binding.
and
we
do
have
a
letter
from
him
and
the
first
thing
in
our
appendix
to
the
brief,
stating
that
he
will
continue
to
prosecute.
so
the
doctors
in
texas,
even
with
the
federal
decision
and
even
after
the
vuitch
decision,
do
not
feel
free
to
perform
abortions.
and,
instead,
728
women
in
the
first
nine
months
after
the
decision
went
to
new
york
for
an
abortion.
texas
women
are
coming
here.
it's
so
often
the
poor
and
the
disadvantaged
in
texas
who
are
not
able
to
escape
the
effect
of
the
law.
certainly,
there
are
many
texas
women
who
are
affected
because
our
doctors
still
feel
uncertain
about
the
impact
of
the
law,
even
in
light
of
the
vuitch
decision.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes.
your
honor.
we
do.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor,
there
are.
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
my
reading
of
younger
versus
harris,
the
companion
cases,
all
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
those
cases
was
a
situation
where
there
was
an
attempt
to
interfere
with
a
pending
state
criminal
prosecution.
in
this
case,
as
i
pointed
out,
the
original
parties
to
this
matter
are
women,
and
in
one
case,
the
husband.
the
women
certainly
are
not
subject
to
prosecution
in
the
state
of
texas.
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
stand
in
the
criminal
dock
and
litigate
their
interests.
they
came
seeking
injunctive
relief.
but
it
was
not
against
pending
state
criminal
prosecution.
they
were
not
even
aware
of
the
prosecution
against
dr.
hallford.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
we
have
expressed
texas
cases.
in
one
situation,
woodrow
v.
state,
an
1880
case,
the
woman
had
taken
a
potion
to
induce
abortion,
and
the
texas
court
specifically
said
that
the
woman
is
guilty
of
no
crime,
even
in
that
situation.
and,
that
in
fact
she
is
the
victim
of
our
law.
there
is
no
declaratory
relief
available
for
these
plaintiffs.
their
only
forum
was
the
federal
courts,
and
it
was
to
those
courts
that
they
turned
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes
sir.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
the
physician
intervened
after
the
order
was
entered
granting
jane
roe
a
three-judge
court.
and
he
intervened,
again,
asking
only
that
future
prosecution
under
the
law
be
enjoined.
he
did
not
ask
any
relief
of
the
court
relating
to
his
pending
state
criminal
prosecution.
he
did
specifically,
in
his
complaint,
reserve
the
right
to
ask
for
future
relief.
but,
that
was
never
done.
and
certainly,
in
the
future,
he
were
to
ask
for
relief,
the
court
would
have
the
guidance
of
the
younger
versus
harris
companion
cases.
but
there
was
in
no
way
any
request
for
any
action
to
interfere
with
the
pending
criminal
prosecutions
then
in
process.
there
is
an
allegation
that
the
question
is
moot
since
the
woman
has
now
has
carried
the
pregnancy
to
term.
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
realize
that
there
are
several
important
aspects
in
which
this
case
differs
from
the
case
that
the
courts
might
usually
be
presented.
first,
the
case
is
different
in
the
nature
of
the
interest
which
is
involved,
and
in
the
extent
to
which
personal
determination
is
undermined
by
this
statute
-
the
effect
that
it
has
on
women.
second,
it
is
unique
in
the
type
of
injury
that's
presented.
certainly
there
are
some
injuries
that
can
be
compensated,
and
most
last
over
a
sufficient
period
of
time
for
the
courts
to
litigate
the
interest.
but
in
this
case,
a
progressing
pregnancy
does
not
suspend
itself
in
order
to
give
the
courts
time
to
act.
certainly
jane
roe
brought
her
suit
as
soon
as
she
knew
she
was
pregnant.
as
soon
as
she
had
sought
an
abortion,
and
then
denied,
she
came
to
federal
court.
she
came
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
women.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
that
women
in
texas
continued
to
desire
abortions,
and
to
seek
them
out
outside
our
state.
there
was
an
absence
of
any
other
remedy,
and
without
the
ability
to
litigate
her
claim
as
a
pregnant
woman
who
came
seeking
relief
and
who
was
affected
by
the
time
required
by
the
federal
process;
not
because
of
any
infirmity
in
her
own
attempt
to
litigate
her
interests
that
this
will,
in
fact,
be
a
case
certainly
presenting
substantial
federal
question,
and
yet
awaiting
review
in
the
future.
i
think
the
third
way
in
which
it
is
unique
is,
as
i
have
stated
the
fact
that
it
is
the
only
forum
available
to
these
women.
they
have
no
other
way
to
litigate
their
interests
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor.
declaratory
judgments
in
the
state
of
texas
are
limited
to
a
situation
where
property
rights
are
involved.
and
we
also
have
a
very
unusual
situation
in
texas,
where
we
have
two
concurrent
jurisdictions,
one
the
civil
and
one
the
criminal.
and
even
--
there
are
some
cases
which
indicate
that
our
state
supreme
court
would
not
have
the
ability
to
mandamus
any
of
the
criminal
prosecution
officers
because
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
jurisdiction
as
to
all
criminal
matters
in
the
state
of
texas.
so,
even
if
the
woman
had
been
able
to
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
--
which
she
couldn't
--
she
couldn't
have
gotten
any
sort
of
relief
against
future
prosecutions.
and
it
was
exactly
the
absence
of
the
court
granting
an
injunction
against
future
prosecutions
which
had
resulted
in
the
irreparable
injuries
these
women
have
suffered.
in
texas,
the
woman
is
the
victim.
the
state
cannot
deny
the
effect
that
this
law
has
on
the
women
of
texas.
certainly
there
are
problems
regarding
even
the
use
of
contraception.
abortion
now,
for
a
woman,
is
safer
than
childbirth.
in
the
absence
of
abortions,
or
legal
medically
safe
abortions-women
often
result
to
the
illegal
abortions,
which
certainly
carry
risks
of
death,
all
the
side
effects
such
as
severe
infections,
permanent
sterility,
all
the
complications
that
result.
and,
in
fact,
if
the
woman
is
unable
to
get
either
a
legal
abortion
or
an
illegal
abortion
in
our
state,
she
can
do
a
self-abortion,
which
is
certainly,
perhaps,
by
far
the
most
dangerous.
and
that
is
no
crime.
she
is
in
our
state
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
excuse
me,
your
honor.
thank
you.
texas,
for
example,
it
appears
to
us,
would
not
allow
any
relief
at
all,
even
in
situations
where
the
mother
would
suffer
perhaps
serious
physical
or
mental
harm.
there
is
certainly
a
great
question
about
it.
if
the
pregnancy
would
result
in
the
birth
of
a
deformed
or
defective
child,
she
has
no
relief.
regardless
of
the
circumstances
of
conception,
whether
it
was
because
of
rape,
incest,
whether
she
is
extremely
immature,
she
has
no
relief.
i
think
it's
without
question
that
pregnancy
to
a
woman
can
completely
disrupt
her
life.
whether
she's
unmarried;
whether
she's
pursuing
an
education;
whether
she's
pursuing
a
career;
whether
she
has
family
problems;
all
of
the
problems
of
personal
and
family
life,
for
a
woman,
are
bound
up
in
the
problem
of
abortion.
for
example,
in
our
state
there
are
many
schools
where
a
woman
is
forced
to
quit
if
she
becomes
pregnant.
in
the
city
of
austin
that
is
true.
a
woman,
if
she
becomes
pregnant,
and
is
in
high
school,
must
drop
out
of
regular
education
process.
and
that's
true
of
some
colleges
in
our
state.
in
the
matter
of
employment,
she
often
is
forced
to
quit
at
an
early
point
in
her
pregnancy.
she
has
no
provision
for
maternity
leave.
she
cannot
get
unemployment
compensation
under
our
laws,
because
the
laws
hold
that
she
is
not
eligible
for
employment,
being
pregnant,
and
therefore
is
eligible
for
no
unemployment
compensation.
at
the
same
time,
she
can
get
no
welfare
to
help
her
at
a
time
but
she
has
no
unemployment
compensation
and
she's
not
eligible
for
any
help
in
getting
a
job
to
provide
for
herself.
there
is
no
duty
for
employers
to
rehire
women
if
they
must
drop
out
to
carry
a
pregnancy
to
term.
and,
of
course,
this
is
especially
hard
on
the
many
women
in
texas
who
are
heads
of
their
own
households
and
must
provide
for
their
already
existing
children.
and,
obviously,
the
responsibility
of
raising
a
child
is
a
most
serious
one,
and
at
times
an
emotional
investment
that
must
be
made,
cannot
be
denied.
so,
a
pregnancy
to
a
woman
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
determinative
aspects
of
her
life.
it
disrupts
her
body.
it
disrupts
her
education.
it
disrupts
her
employment.
and
it
often
disrupts
her
entire
family
life.
and
we
feel
that,
because
of
the
impact
on
the
woman,
this
certainly
and
as
far
as
there
are
any
rights
which
are
fundamental
is
a
matter
which
is
of
such
fundamental
and
basic
concern
to
the
woman
involved
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
make
the
choice
as
to
whether
to
continue
or
to
terminate
her
pregnancy.
i
think
the
question
is
equally
serious
for
the
physicians
of
our
state.
they
are
seeking
to
practice
medicine
in
what
they
consider
the
highest
method
of
practice.
we
have
affidavits
in
the
back
of
our
brief
from
each
of
the
heads
of
public
of
heads
of
obstetrics
and
gynecology
departments
from
each
of
our
public
medical
schools
in
texas.
and
each
of
them
points
out
that
they
were
willing
and
interested
to
immediately
begin
to
formulate
methods
of
providing
care
and
services
for
women
who
are
pregnant
and
do
not
desire
to
continue
the
pregnancy.
they
were
stopped
cold
in
their
efforts,
even
with
the
declaratory
judgment,
because
of
the
da's
position
that
they
would
continue
to
prosecute.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
your
honors,
in
the
lower
court,
as
i'm
sure
you're
aware,
the
court
held
that
the
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
continue
a
pregnancy
rested
upon
the
ninth
amendment
which,
of
course,
reserves
those
rights
not
specifically
enumerated
to
the
government,
to
the
people.
i
think
it
is
important
to
note,
in
a
law
review
article
recently
submitted
to
the
court
and
distributed
among
counsel
by
professor
cyril
means,
jr.,
entitled
"the
phoenix
of
abortional
freedom,"
that
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted
there
was
no
common
law
prohibition
against
abortions;
that
they
were
available
to
the
women
of
this
country.
certainly,
under
the
griswold
decision,
it
appears
that
the
members
of
the
court
in
that
case
were
obviously
divided
as
to
the
specific
constitutional
framework
of
the
right
which
they
held
to
exist
in
the
griswold
decision.
i'm
a
little
reluctant
to
aspire
to
a
wisdom
that
the
court
was
not
in
agreement
on.
i
do
feel
that
the
ninth
amendment
is
an
appropriate
place
for
the
freedom
to
rest.
i
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
equally
an
appropriate
place,
under
the
rights
of
persons
to
life,
liberty,
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness.
i
think
that
in
as
far
as
"liberty"
is
meaningful,
that
liberty
to
these
women
would
mean
liberty
from
being
forced
to
continue
the
unwanted
pregnancy.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
we
had
originally
brought
this
suit
alleging
both
the
due
process
clause,
equal
protection
clause,
the
ninth
amendment,
and
a
variety
of
others.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
right.
since
that
district
court
found
the
right
to
reside
in
the
ninth
amendment,
we
pointed
our
attention
in
the
brief
to
that
particular
aspect
of
the
constitution.
but
i
think
we
would
not
presume
--
i
do
feel
that
in-so-much
as
members
of
the
court
can
say
that
the
ninth
amendment
applies
to
rights
reserved
to
the
people,
and
those
which
were
most
important-and
certainly
this
is
that
the
ninth
amendment
is
appropriate
place
insofar
as
the
court
has
said
that
life,
liberty,
in
a
pursuit
of
happiness
involved
the
most
fundamental
things
of
people;
that
this
matter
is
one
of
those
most
fundamental
matters.
i
think,
in
as
far
as
the
court
has
said
that
there
is
a
penumbra
that
exists
to
encompass
the
entire
purpose
of
the
constitution,
that
i
think
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
constitution
was
to
guarantee
to
the
individual
the
right
to
determine
the
course
of
their
own
lives.
insofar
as
there
was,
perhaps,
no
compelling
state
interest
and
we
allege
there
is
none
in
this
case
that,
there
again,
that
the
right
fits
within
the
framework
of
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
sir,
your
honor.
no,
sir,
there
is
not.
the
only
legislative
history,
of
course,
is
that
which
is
found
in
other
states
which
has
been
pointed
out
to
the
court
before
-
and,
as
professor
means
points
out
again,
that
these
statutes
were
adopted
for
the
health
of
the
mother.
certainly,
the
texas
courts
have
referred
to
the
woman
as
being
the
victim,
and
they
have
never
referred
to
anyone
else
as
being
the
victim.
concepts
have
certainly
changed.
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
in
texas
self-abortion
is
no
crime.
the
woman
is
guilty
of
no
crime,
even
though
she
seeks
out
the
doctor;
even
though
she
consents;
even
though
she
participates;
even
though
she
pays
for
the
procedure.
she,
again,
is
guilty
of
no
crime
whatsoever.
it's
also
interesting
that
in
our
statutes
--
the
penalty
for
the
offense
of
abortion
depends
on
whether
or
not
the
consent
of
the
woman
was
obtained
prior
to
the
procedure.
it's
double
if
you
don't
get
her
consent.
there
is
no
indication
in
fondgren
v.
state,
for
example,
the
court
ruled
that
a
woman
who
commits
an
abortion
on
herself
is
guilty
of
no
crime.
again,
"she"
being
regarded
as
the
victim,
rather
than
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime.
obviously,
in
our
state,
the
offense
is
not
murder.
it
is
an
abortion,
which
carries
a
significantly
lesser
offense.
there
is
no
requirement
of
--
even
though
the
state,
in
its
brief,
points
out
the
development
of
the
fetus
that
in
an
eight-week
period,
the
same
state,
does
not
require
any
death
certificate,
or
any
formalities
of
birth.
the
product
of
such
a
conception
would
be
handled
merely
as
a
pathological
specimen.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
time
limit
or
indication
of
time,
whatsoever.
so
i
think.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
sir.
i
do.
i
feel
that
the
question
of
a
time
limit
is
not
strictly
before
the
court,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
situation
in
which
the
case
is
handled.
certainly
i
think,
as
a
practical
matter
though,
most
of
the
states
that
do
have
some
time
limit
indicated
still
permit
abortions
beyond
the
time
limit
for
specified
reasons,
usually
where
the
health
of
the
mother
is
involved.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
as
to
a
time
limit.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
is
our
position
that
the
freedom
involved
is
that
of
a
woman
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
continue
a
pregnancy.
obviously
i
have
a
much
more
difficult
time
saying
that
the
state
has
no
interest
in
late
pregnancy.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
think
it
is
more
the
emotional
response
to
a
late
pregnancy
rather
than
it
is
any
constitutional.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
guess
by
persons
considering
the
issue
outside
the
legal
context.
i
think,
as
far
as
the
state.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
would
say
the
constitutional.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
the
constitution,
as
i
read
it,
and
as
interpreted
and
as
documented
by
professor
means,
attaches
protection
to
the
person
at
the
time
of
birth.
those
persons
born
are
citizens.
the
enumeration
clause,
we
count
those
people
who
are
born.
the
constitution,
as
i
see
it,
gives
protection
to
people
after
birth.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
sir.
certainly,
in
your
dissent,
you
pointed
out
in
perez
v.
ledesma,
not
a
concurring
opinion.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
was
a
dissent.
that
there
are
different
standards
that
apply
to
the
declaratory
judgment,
and
to
injunctive
relief.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
that
is
correct.
and
that's
what
the
court
said,
following
zwickler
v.
koota,
that
even
though
they
were
granting
declaratory
relief,
different
considerations
applied
as
to
injunctive
relief.
but
it
seems
that
the
opinions
of
this
court
have
established
that
where
there
is
great
and
immediate
threat
of
irreparable
injury,
with
no
adequate
remedy
in
state
court,
that
an
injunction
is
still
proper.
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
great
and
immediate
threat
of
irreparable
injury
in
the
form
of
a
continuing
pregnancy
that
will
not
abate,
and
that
continues.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
the
doctor,
as
i
said,
was
asking
no
relief
as
to
the
pending
prosecution.
he
was
only
asking
relief
as
to
future
prosecutions.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor.
he
joined
in
both
the
request
for
the
declaratory
judgment.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
where
there
were
pending
--.
samuels
v.
mackell,
as
i
read
it,
did
say
that
where
you
have
a
request
for
a
declaratory
judgment
there
would
be
an
effect
on
a
pending
criminal
prosecution.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
there
was
one
pending
when
this
action
was
brought,
those
against
dr.
hallford.
however,
in
this
case
we
submit
that
if
there
is
to
be
any
meaning
to
the
federal
courts
as
the
supreme
arbiters
of
constitutional
rights,
that
they
must
be
able
to
act,
at
least
in
some
form,
when
there
are
pending
criminal
prosecutions
--
not
particularly
against
the
person
involved
in
the
prosecution,
but
others.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor.
but
again
as
i
understood
it—
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i'm
suggesting
that
in
this
case
the
women
in
particular
brought
a
declaratory
action
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
pending
state
criminal
prosecution.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
and
that
the
intervention
of
the
doctor
certainly
should
not
be
sufficient.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
right.
that
because
the
doctor
intervened
when
he
was
asking
no
relief
as
to
the
pending
state
criminal
prosecution,
that
his
intervention
--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that's
correct.
he
is
willing
to
litigate
his
interest.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
as
to
future
prosecution.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
and
which
your
dissent
said
was
incorrect.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
was
a
dissent,
okay.
i
think
perhaps
we
would
stress
that
there
are
two
separate
actions
before
the
court
first,
that
of
the
women;
and,
second,
that
of
the
doctor.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
even
though
the
court
might
find
that
the
doctor
was
an
inappropriate
party
for
relief,
it
certainly
would
not
effect
the
original
action
as
brought
by
the
women.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
because
they
are
still
subject
to
the
irreparable
injury,
and
have
no
adequate
state
remedy.
and,
if
they
are
not
able
to
continue
to
litigate
their
interest
in
this
situation,
any
time
there
was
any
prosecution
pending
against
anyone
in
the
state,
at
any
point
in
the
appeal-for
example,
the
thompson
case
was
filed
in
1968.
it's
been
decided
now
in
our
state
courts.
it's
on
appeal,
or
it
will
be
appealed
here,
i
think.
and,
certainly
if
they
cannot
litigate
their
interests
while
there
is
a
prosecution
pending
against
the
doctor,
they
will
--
in
many
instances
where
a
statute—
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes.
they
cannot
even
decide
to
take
the
risk
for
themselves
under
the
declaratory
judgment.
they
must
rely
on
another
person
to
take
that
risk.
but,
certainly,
the
doctor
raised
not
only
his
own
rights,
but
the
rights
of
his
patients.
and
those
same
patients
are
suffering
the
same
sort
of
irreparable
injury
that
the
original
plaintiffs
were
suffering.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor,
he
can.
but
i
don't
feel
it's
appropriate
to
make
those
women
who
are
most
vitally
affected
certainly
more
so
than
the
doctor,
who
can
merely
decide
not
to
perform
an
abortion,
and
thereby
escape
--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor.
my
point
being
that
these
women
should
not
be
compelled
to
leave
it
up
to
a
doctor
to
litigate
those
interests.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
well,
i
think
there
are
different
interests
involved.
and
in
most
criminal
prosecutions
the
doctors
would
bring
up
other
problems,
such
as
--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes.
or
the
witnesses
disappeared,
or
it
really
was
for
this
reason,
in
this
particular
case.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
one
recent
opinion,
thompson
v.
the
state
of
texas,
which
the
attorney
general
attempted
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
and
it
was
not
printed,
and
the
court
rejected
it.
but
it
was
a
decision
about
a
month-and-a-half
ago
which
originated
in
houston.
a
doctor
there
was
indicted
on
a
charge
of
abortion.
at
trial
he
used
only
an
alibi
defense.
but
on
his
appeal
he
did
raise
the
same
constitutional
questions
that
we
raised
in
the
federal
courts.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
your
honor,
they
could
have,
but
they
didn't.
they
went
ahead
and
litigated
those
issues,
and
our
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals-which
is
our
highest
court-has
now
held
that
the
statute
is
not
vague,
citing
vuitch,
which,
again,
i
would
contend
is
an
incorrect
reliance.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
and,
second,
they
did
not
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
right
to
privacy;
but
did
hold
there
was
a
compelling
interest.
so,
in
that
particular
situation,
which
is
the
only
situation,
a
doctor
did
attempt
to
litigate
the
same
issues—
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
they
have
held,
really,
directly
in
opposition
to
the
federal
court
opinion
from
which
we
are
appealing.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
they
have
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing
in
the
state
court
of
criminal
appeals,
which
will
be
argued
tomorrow.
i
think
it's
very
unlikely
that
the
court
would
change
its
opinion,
and
it
is
the
intention
of
those
parties
to
appeal.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
your
honor,
only
if
they
are
born
alive.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
recently
has
held
in
one
case
that
there
is
an
action
for
prenatal
injuries
at
any
stage
prior
to
birth,
but
only
upon
the
condition
that
it
be
born
alive.
the
same
is
true
of
our
property
law.
the
child
must
be
born
alive.
and
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
those
children
which
are
ultimately
born;
and
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
give
them
retroactive
rights.
but
i
think
that's
a
completely
different
question
from
whether
or
not
they
had
rights
at
the
time
they
were
still
in
the
womb
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
there
had
been
no
situation
litigated
like
that
in
texas.
i
suppose
you
noted
that
the
--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
the
iowa
supreme
court
about
two
weeks
ago
held
that
where
it
was
stillborn
there
was
no
cause
of
action
whatsoever
--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
oh,
i
am
speaking-excuse
me,
solely
for
the
fetus;
that
the
fetus
had
no
independent
right;
that
the
mother
--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
only
for
her
injury.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
your
honor.
thank
you.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
your
honor,
i
would
only
like
to
draw
to
the
court's
attention
at
page
130
of
the
record,
the
notice
of
appeal
by
defendant
state
of
texas,
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
they
have
filed
an
appeal
in
this
court.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
once
again
before
this
court
to
ask
relief
against
the
continued
enforcement
of
the
texas
abortion
statute
and
ask
that
you
affirm
the
ruling
of
the
three-judge
court
below
which
held
our
statute
unconstitutional
for
two
reasons,
the
first,
that
it
was
vague
and,
the
second,
that
it
interfered
with
the
ninth
amendment
right
for
a
woman
to
determine
whether
or
not
she
would
continue
or
terminate
her
pregnancy.
as
you
will
recall,
there
are
three--
four--
three
plaintiffs
and
one
intervener
involved
here.
the
first
plaintiff
was
jane
roe,
an
unmarried
pregnant
girl
who
had
sought
an
abortion
in
the
state
of
texas
and
was
denied
it
because
of
the
texas
abortion
statute
which
provides
an
abortion
is
lawful
only
for
the
purpose
of
saving
the
life
of
the
woman.
in
the
original
action,
she
was
joined
by
a
married
couple,
john
and
mary
doe.
mrs.
doe
had
a
medical
condition.
her
doctor
had
recommended
first
that
she
not
get
pregnant
and,
second,
that
she
not
take
the
pill.
after
this
cause
was
instituted
and
after,
in
fact,
the
three-judge
court
had
been
granted,
those
three
plaintiffs
were
joined
by
an
intervener,
doctor
hallford,
who
was,
at
the
time
he
intervened,
under
a
pending
state
criminal
prosecution
under
the
statute.
he
did
not
ask
that
his
prosecution
be
joined--
be
stopped
by
the
court
but,
rather,
joined
in
the
original
request
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
injunctive
relief
against
future
prosecutions.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
has
not--
his
prosecution
has
not
been
continued,
but
the
district
attorney,
against
whom
we
filed
a
suit,
has
taken
a
position
that
because
there
was
no
injunction
he
is
still
free
to
institute
prosecutions.
there
is
a
letter
from
his
office
in
the
appendix
stating
that
he
will
continue
prosecutions
and,
in
fact,
there
had
been
a
very
limited
number
of
prosecutions
instituted
in
the
state
of
texas
since
the
three-judge
court
entered
its
declaratory
judgment.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
prosecutions
of
doctors,
yes,
sir.
the
problem
that
we
face
in
texas
is
that
even
though
we
were
granted
a
declaratory
judgment
ruling
the
law
unconstitutional
and
even
though
we’ve
been
before
this
court
once
in
the
past,
in
texas,
women
still
are
not
able
to
receive
abortions
from
licensed
doctors
because
doctors
still
fear
that
they
will
be
prosecuted
under
the
statute.
so,
if
the
declaratory
judgment
was
any
relief
at
all,
it
was
an
almost
meaningful
relief
because
the
women
of
texas
still
must
either
travel
to
other
states,
if
they
are
that
sophisticated
and
can
afford
it,
or
they
must
resort
to
some
other
less--
some
other
very
undesirable
alternatives
and--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
it’s
just--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
in
fact,
we’ve
pointed
out
in
our
supplemental
brief
filed
here
that
there
had
been
something
like
1,600
texas
women
who
have
gone
to
new
york
city
alone
for
abortions
in
the
first
nine
months
of
1971.
in
addition,
i
think
the
court
would
recognize
there
are
many
women
going
to
other
parts
of
the
country.
one
of
the
objections
that
our
opponents
have
raised
is
saying
that
this
court
is
moot
because,
of
course,
the
woman
is
no
longer
pregnant.
it’s
been
almost
three
years
since
we
instituted
the
original
action
and,
yet,
we
can
certainly
show
that
it
is
a
continuing
problem
to
texas
women.
there
still
are
unwanted
pregnancies.
there
are
still
women
who,
for
various
reasons,
do
not
wish
to
continue
the
pregnancy
whether
because
of
personal
health
considerations,
whether
because
of
their
family
situation,
whether
because
of
financial
situations,
education,
working
situations,
some
of
the
many
things
we
discussed
in
the
last
hearing.
since
the
last
hearing
before
this
court,
there
have
been
a
few
cases
decided
that
we
wanted
to
draw
the
court’s
attention
to
and
are
covered
in
our
supplemental
brief.
in
addition,
there
is
a
supplemental
brief
filed
by
an
amicus
party,
harriet
pilpel
on
behalf
of
planned
parenthood
of
new
york,
that
seeks
to
point
out
to
the
court
at
pages
6
and
7,
subsequent
pages,
some
of
the
changing
medical
statistics
available
regarding
the
procedure
of
abortion.
for
example,
that
brief
points
out
that
the
overall
maternal
death
rate
from
legal
abortion
in
new
york
dropped
to
3.7
per
100,000
abortions
in
the
last
half
of
1971
and
that,
in
fact,
is
less
than
half
of
the
death
rate
associated
with
live
delivery
for
women.
that,
in
fact,
the
maternal
morbidity--
mortality
rate
has
decreased
by
about
two-thirds
to
a
record
low
in
new
york
in
1971.
that--
now,
in
1971,
new
york
recorded
the
lowest
infant
mortality
rate
ever
in
that
state.
that
during
the
first
18
months
of
19--
well,
from
july
1,
1970
to
december
31,
1971,
out
of
wedlock
pregnancies
have
dropped
about
14%.
we
now
have
other
statistics
coming
from
california
and
other
states
that
show
that
not
only
has
the
overall
birthrate
declined,
but
the
welfare
birthrate
has
also
declined
accordingly.
as
to
the
women,
this
is
their
only
forum.
they
are
in
a
very
unique
situation
for
several
reasons.
first,
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
interest
involved,
their
primary
interest
being
the
interest
associated
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
will
be
forced
by
the
state
to
continue
an
unwanted
pregnancy.
in
our
original
brief,
we
alleged
a
number
of
constitutional
grounds.
the
main
one
that
we
are
relying
on
before
this
court
are
the
fifth,
ninth,
and
the
fourteenth
amendments.
there’s
a
great
body
of
precedent.
certainly,
we
cannot
say
that
there
isn’t
a
constitution
so
stated
the
right
to
abortion
but,
neither
is
there
stated
the
right
to
travel
or
some
of
the
other
basic
rights
that
this
court
have
held
are
under
the
united
states
constitution.
the
court
has
in
the
past,
for
example,
held
that
it
is
the
right
of
the
parents
and
not
of
the
individual
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
will
send
their
child
to
private
school,
whether
or
not
their
children
will
be
taught
foreign
languages,
whether
or
not
they
will
have
offspring
in
the
skinner
case,
whether
the
right
to
determine
for
themselves
whom
they
will
marry
in
the
loving
case,
and
even
in
body
versus
connecticut
the
choice
saying
that
marriage
itself
is
so
important
that
the
state
cannot
interfere
with
termination
of
a
marriage
just
because
the
woman
is
unable
to
pay
the
cost.
griswold,
of
course,
is
the
primary
case
holding
that
the
state
could
not
interfere
in
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
married
couple
would
use
birth
control
and,
since
then,
the
courts
have--
this
court,
of
course,
has
held
that
the
individual
has
the
right
to
determine
whether
they
are
married
or
single,
whether
they
would
use
birth
control.
so,
there
is
a
great
body
of
cases
decided
in
the
past
by
this
court
in
the
areas
of
marriage,
sex,
contraception,
procreation,
childbearing,
and
education
of
children
which
says
that
there
are
certain
things
that
are
so
much
part
of
the
individual
concern
that
they
should
be
left
to
the
determination
of
the
individual.
one
of
the
cases
decided
since
our
last
argument,
december
13,
was
the
second
connecticut
case,
abele
versus
markle,
which
judge--
excuse
me?
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
judge
newman
wrote
the
opinion,
yes.
thank
you.
and,
judge
lambert
concurred.
part
of
the
lang--
in
that
case,
that
three-judge
court
held
the
connecticut
statute,
a
slightly
revised
statute
for
the
second
time,
to
be
unconstitutional,
and
part
of
the
language
of
that
case
pointed
out
that
“no
decision
of
the
supreme
court
has
ever
permitted
anyone’s
constitutional
right
to
be
directly
abridged
to
protect
a
state
interest
which
is
subject
to
such
a
variety
of
personal
judgments”
and,
certainly,
the
amicus
brief
stag
before
the
court
showed
a
variety
of
personal
judgments
that
come
to
bear
on
this
particular
situation.
to
oppose
such
a
statute,
the
court
said,
would
be
to
permit
the
state
to
impose
its
view
of
the
nature
of
a
fetus
upon
those
who
have
the
constitutional
right
to
base
an
important
decision
in
their
personal
lives
upon
a
different
view.
again,
this
is
a
very
special
type
case
for
the
women
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
injury
involved.
it
is
an
irreparable
injury.
once
pregnancy
has
started,
certainly
this
is
not
the
kind
of
injury
that
can
be
later
adjudicated.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
injury
that
can
later
be
compensated
by
some
sort
of
monetary
reward.
these
women
who
have
now
gone
through
pregnancy
and
the
women
who
continue
to
be
forced
to
go
through
pregnancy
have
certainly
gone
through
something
that
is
irreparable,
that
can
never
be
changed
for
them.
it
is
certainly
great
and
it
is
certainly
immediate.
there
is
no
other
forum
available
to
them.
as
we
talked
last
time,
they
are
not
subject
in
texas
to
any
kind
of
criminal
prosecution
whether
the
woman
performs
self-abortion,
whether
she
goes
to
a
doctor,
finds
someone
who
will
perform
it
on
her.
she
is
guilty
of
no
crime
whatsoever
and,
yet,
the
state
tries
to
allege
that
its
purpose
in
the
statute
was
to
protect
the
fetus.
if
that’s
true,
the
fact
the
woman
is
guilty
of
no
crime
is
not
a
reasonable
kind
of--
it
does
not
reasonably
follow.
these--
the
women
are
not
able
to
have
any
kind
of
declaratory
judgment
in
texas
because
of
our
special
declaratory
judgment
statutes
and
our
concurring
criminal
and
civil
courts,
the
two
different
kinds
of
cases
that
we
have.
so,
the
federal
court
was
the
only
court
to
which
the
women
had
any
kind
of
access,
and
it
was
to
the
federal
courts
they
came,
and
it’s
the
federal
court,
in
my
judgment,
that
should
determine
this
case.
it’s
a
very
unique
kind
of
harm,
certainly,
that
was
done
to
them.
even
though
there
are
many
cases,
some
very
recent
from
this
court,
talking
about
the
problem
of
when
a
state
may
interfere
when
they’re--
or
the
federal
judiciary
may
interfere
when
there
is
a
pending
state
criminal
prosecution.
this
case
does
come
under
the
exceptions
in
that
there
is
great,
immediate,
irreparable
injury
where
there
is
no
other
forum.
it
is
something
that,
as
far
as
these
women
are
concerned,
can
never
be
adjudicated
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
much
less
in
a
single
criminal
prosecution.
it
certainly
is
an
instance
of
a
situation
that
is
capable
of
repetition,
yet,
evading
review.
the
judiciary
simply
does
not
move
fast
enough
for
the
case
to
be
decided
within
the
period
of
gestation,
much
less
within
the
period
within
which
an
abortion
would
be
medically
safe
for
these
women.
the
state
has
alleged
and
it’s
only
alleged
interest
in
the
statute
is
the
interest
in
protecting
the
life
of
the
unborn.
however,
the
state
has
not
been
able
to
point
to
any
authority
of
any
nature
whatsoever
that
would
demonstrate
that
this
statute
was,
in
fact,
adopted
for
that
purpose.
we
have
some
indication
that
other
state
statutes
were
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
health
of
the
woman.
we
have
an
1880
case
in
texas,
shortly
after
the
1854
statute
was
adopted,
that
states
that
a
woman
is
the
victim
of
the
crime
and
is
the
only
victim
the
court
talks
about.
we
have
all
the
contradictions
in
the
statute
in
the
way--
so
many
things
that
just
don’t
make
sense.
if
the
statute
was
adopted
for
that
purpose,
for
example,
why
is
the
woman
guilty
of
no
crime?
if
the
statute
was
adopted
for
that
purpose,
why
is
it
that
the
penalty
for
abortion
is
determined
by
whether
or
not
you
have
the
woman’s
consent?
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that’s
correct.
there
had
been
two
cases
decided
since
the
december
13
argument
that
expressly
hold
that
a
fetus
has
no
constitutional
rights,
one
being
byrn
versus
new
york,
and
the
other
being
the
magee-womens
hospital
cases.
in
both
situations,
a
person
sought
to
bring
that
very
question
to
the
court
does
in
the
one
instance,
byrn,
was
a
challenge
to
the
new
york
revised
statute,
the
other
was
a
situation
where
a
person
sought
to
prevent
magee-womens
hospital
from
allowing
further
abortions
to
be
done
in
that
hospital.
and,
in
both
cases,
it
was
held
that
the
fetus
had
no
constitutional
rights.
several
of
the
briefs
before
this
court
would
also
argue
that
this
court
in
deciding
the
vuitch
case
which
has
allowed
abortions
to
continue
in
the
district
of
columbia,
certainly
the
court
would
not
have
made
that
kind
of
decision
if
it
felt
there
were
any
ingrained
rights
of
the
fetus
within
the
constitution.
there
had
also--
there
is
also,
of
course--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
critical
first
that
we
prove
this
is
a
fundamental
interest
on
behalf
of
the
woman,
that
it
is
a
constitutional
right
and,
second--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
okay
and,
second,
that
the
state
has
no
compelling
state
interest.
okay,
and
the
state
is
alleging
a
compelling
state
interest.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
all
of
the
cases,
the
prior
history
of
this
statute,
the
common
law
history
would
indicate
that
it
is
not.
the
state
has
shown
no--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
then
you
would
have
a
balancing
of
interests.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
excuse
me?
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
seems
to
me
that
you
do
not
balance
constitutional
rights
of
one
person
against
mere
statutory
rights
of
another.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
think--
it
would
seem
to
me
that--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
if
the
state
could
show
that
the
fetus
was
a
person
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
under
some
other
amendment
or
part
of
the
constitution,
then
you
would
have
the
situation
of
trying--
you
would
have
a
state
compelling
interest
which,
in
some
instances,
can
outweigh
a
fundamental
right.
this
is
not
the
case
in
this
particular
situation.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
our
statute
does
not.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
we
are
asking
in
this
case
that
the
court
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional,
the
state
having
proved
no
compelling
interest
at
all.
there
are
some
states
that
now
have
adopted
time
limits.
those
have
not
yet
been
challenged
and,
perhaps,
that
question
will
be
before
this
court.
even
those
statutes
though
allow
exceptions,
well,
for--
new
york,
for
example,
says
an
abortion
is
lawful
up
to
24
weeks,
but
even
after
the
24
weeks
it
is
still
lawful
where
there
is
rape
or
incest
or
where
the
mother’s
mental
or
physical
health
is
involved.
in
other
words,
even
after
that
period,
it’s
not
a
hard
and
fast
cutoff.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
the
legislature
and
in
that
situation
engaged
in
the
weighing
process,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
has
not
yet
been
determined
whether
the
state
has
the
compelling
state
interest
to
uphold
even
that
kind
of
regulation,
but
that’s
really
not
before
the
court
in
this
particular
case.
we
have
no
time
limit.
there
is
no
indication
in
texas
that
any
would
be
applied
in
any
future
date.
you
know,
we
just
don’t
know
that.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that’s
correct.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
our--texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
thompson
versus
state--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
in
november
or
last--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
it--
that
particular
case
held
that
the
texas
statute
was
not
vague
citing
vuitch.
it’s
my
opinion
that
that
reliance
was
misplaced.
that,
in
vuitch,
this
court
had
before
it
the
d.c.
statute
which
allowed
abortion
for
the
purpose
of
saving
the
life
or
the
health,
and
this
court
adopted
the
interpretation
that
health
meant
both
mental
and
physical
health.
and,
it
seem
to
me,
the
court’s
language
in
that
case
talked
a
great
deal
about
the
fact
that
the
doctor’s
judgment
goes
to
saving
the
health
of
the
woman,
that
that’s
the
kind
of
judgment
that
he
is
used
to
making.
in
texas,
that’s
not
the
judgment
he
is
forced
to
make.
the
judgment
in
texas
is,
is
this
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
the
life
of
the
woman,
and
the
language
of
that
statute
has
never
been
interpreted.
that’s
not
the
kind
of
judgment
that
a
doctor
is
accustomed
or
perhaps
even
able
to
make.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
still
continue
the
argument
that
the
texas
case
is
vague.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
okay.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
am.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
think
two
things
could
be
said.
the
first
would
be
that
situations
and
understandings
change.
in
this
case,
for
example,
we
have
before
the
court
a
medical
amicus
brief
that
was
joined
by
all
of
the
deans
of
the
public
medical
schools
in
texas.
it
was
joined
by
numerous
other
professors
of
medicine.
it
was
joined
by
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists.
you
know--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
none
of
theirs
is--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
okay.
i
guess
it
was--
okay,
in
part,
because
the
hippocratic
oath,
we
discuss
basically
the
constitutional
protection
we
felt
the
woman
to
have.
the
hippocratic
oath
does
not
pertain
to
that.
second,
we
discuss
the
fact
that
the
state
had
not
established
a
compelling
state
interest.
the
hippocratic
oath
would
not
really
pertain
to
that.
and
then,
we
discuss
the
vagueness
jurisdiction.
it
seem
to
us
that
that--
that
the
fact
that
the
medical
profession,
at
one
time,
had
adopted
the
hippocratic
oath
does
not
weight
upon
the
fundamental
constitutional
rights
involved.
it
is
a
guide
for
physicians,
but
the
outstanding
organizations
of
the
medical
profession
have,
in
fact,
adopted
a
position
that
says
the
doctor
and
the
patient
should
be
able
to
make
the
decision
for
themselves
in
this
kind
of
situation.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
well,
i
guess
you--
it
is
old,
and
not
that
it’s
out
of
date,
but
it
seemed
to
us
that
it
was
not
pertinent
to
the
argument
we
were
making.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
yes,
sir.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
think
had
there
been
established
that
the
fetus
was
a
person
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
under
constitutional
protection
then
there
might
be
a
differentiation.
in
this
case,
there
has
never
been
established
that
the
fetus
is
a
person
or
that
it’s
entitled
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
or
the
protection
of
the
constitution.
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
decide
that,
after
birth,
various
classifications
of
persons
would
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty
or
not
but,
here,
we
have
a
person,
the
woman,
entitled
to
fundamental
constitutional
rights
as
opposed
to
the
fetus
prior
to
birth
where
there
is
no
establishment
of
any
kind
of
federal
constitutional
rights.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
depends
on
saying
that
the
woman
has
a
fundament
constitutional
right
and
that
the
state
has
not
proved
any
compelling
interest
for
regulation
in
the
area.
even
if
the
court,
at
some
point,
determined
the
fetus
to
be
entitled
to
constitutional
protection,
you
would
still
get
back
into
the
weighing
of
one
life
against
another.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
your
honor.
i
said
that
would
be
what
would
be
involved
if
the
facts
were
different
and
the
state
could
prove
that
there
was
a
person
for
the
constitutional
right.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
would
have
a
very
difficult
case.
[laughter]
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that’s
right.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that’s
correct.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
no,
your
honor.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
do
not
believe
that
the
state
legislature
can
determine
the
meaning
of
the
federal
constitution.
it
is
up
to
this
court
to
make
that
determination.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
the
state--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
the
state
could
obviously
adopt
that
kind
of
statute
and
then
the
question
would
have
to
be
adjudicated
as
to
whether,
for
all
purposes,
that
statute
is
constitutional.
we
are
not
alleging
that
there
cannot
be
some
kind
of
protection.
for
example,
the
property
rights
which,
again,
are
contingent
on
being—upon
being
born
alive
that
can
be
retroactive
to
the
period
prior
to
birth,
but
in
this
particular
situation,
we
are
alleging
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that
is
only
when
they
are
born
alive,
and
the
fact
that
there
is
a
wrong—the
wrongful
conduct
of
another
is
not
the
same
in
this
situation.
as
to
property
rights,
for
example,
there
are
even
property
rights
that
relate
back
to
prior
to
conception,
children
that
are
not
yet
conceived
can
later
inherit.
but,
that
doesn’t—that
did
not
prevent
this
court
in
griswold
from
holding
people
had
the
right
to
birth
control.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
mr.
flowers
well
made
the
point
when
he
said
that
no
one
can
say
here
is
the
dividing
line,
here
is
where
life
begins,
here
is--
life
is
here
and
life
is
not
over
here.
in
a
situation
where
no
one
can
prove
where
life
begins,
where
no
one
can
show
that
the
constitution
was
adopted,
that
it
was
meant
to
protect
fetal
life,
in
those
situations
where
it
is
shown
that
that
kind
of
decision
is
so
fundamentally
a
part
of
individual
life
of
het
family,
of
such
fundamental
impact
on
the
person--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
at
this--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
at
this
time,
my
point
is
that
this
particular
statute
is
unconstitutional.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
at
this
time,
there
is
no
indication
to
show
that
the
constitution
would
give
any
protection
prior
to
birth.
that
is
not
before
the
court
and
that
is
the
question
i
think--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that’s
correct.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
seems
to
me,
in
this
situation,
the
court
is--
excuse
me,
i
must--
would
you
ask
the
question
again?
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
you
mean
if
the
state,
in
fact,
did
that?
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
it
would
still
be
void
on
its
face
in
this
situation
because
it
is
overly
broad.
it
interferes
in
a--
at
a
time
when
a
state
has
no--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
in
areas
where--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
well--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
my
argument
would,
first,
be
that
it’s
void
on
its
face
and,
second,
if
the
court
finds
it’s
not
void
on
its
face
then
it
certainly
is
void
because
it
infringes
upon
the
fundamental
right
at
a
time
when
the
state
can
show
no
compelling
interest
early
in
pregnancy.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
there,
you
said
the
particular
d.c.
statute
was
not
void
for
vagueness.
it’s
a
different
statute.
there
was
an
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
the
court
there
said
the
doctor
could
work
within
that
context
and
could
tell
what
the
statute
meant.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that’s
correct,
which
makes
it
much
more
difficult
for
the
doctor
to
tell
when
it
is
const--
when
he
can
act.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
including--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
mental

but
then
the
question
is
raised
as
to
the
right
of
privacy
which
was
not
before
the
court
in
the
vuitch
case
and
is
before
the
court
in
this
particular
situation.
as
to
the
hippocratic
oath,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
oath
was
adopted
at
a
time
when
abortion
was
extremely
dangerous
to
the
health
of
the
woman
and,
second,
that
the
oath
is
to
protect
life.
and,
here,
the
question
is
what
does
life
mean
in
this
particular
context?
it’s
the
sort
of
same
vagueness
that
it
seems
to
me
that
your--
well,
okay,
life
there
could
be
slightly
different
because
of
the
constitutional
implications
here.
it
seems
to
me
that--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
to
providing
abortions.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
that’s
correct.
as
to
mutilation,
there,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
purpose
of
those
statutes
was
to
prevent
the
citizen
from
becoming
a
dependent
or
ward
of
the
state
and
also
to
ensure
that
its
citizens
would
be
available
for
service
in
the
military.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
rationale
works
just
the
opposite.
here,
a
woman,
because
of
her
pregnancy,
is
often
not
a
productive
member
of
society.
she
cannot
work.
she
cannot
hold
a
job.
she’s
not
eligible
for
welfare.
she
cannot
get
unemployment
compensation,
and
furthermore,
in
fact,
the
pregnancy
may
produce
a
child
who
will
become
a
ward
of
the
state.
we
do
not
object
to
the
cases
such
as
the
transfusion
case
where
there
is
a
decision
already
made
by
the
woman
that
she
desires
to
carry
the
pregnancy
to
term,
and
when
that
decision
is
made
that
the
child
should
be
given
every
opportunity
to
come
into
life
a
healthy
person.
we
do
not
believe
that
that
necessitates
the
conclusion
that,
therefore,
under
the
constitution
prior
to
birth
a
person
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
exist
there.
this
case--
this
court
is
faced
with
the
situation
where
there
have
been
14
three-judge
courts
that
ruled
on
the
constitutionality
of
abortion
statutes,
9
courts
have
favored
the
woman,
5
have
gone
against
her.
25
judges
have
favored
the
woman,
17
have
gone
against
her.
9
circuit
judges
have
favored
the
woman,
5
have
gone
against
her.
16
district
court
judges
have
favored
the
woman,
10
have
gone
against
her.
no
one
is
more
keenly
aware
of
the
gravity
of
the
issues
of
the
moral
implications
of
this
case,
but
it
is
a
case
that
must
be
decided
on
the
constitution.
we
do
not
disagree
that
there
is
a
progression
of
fetal
development.
it
is
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
that,
upon
which
we
disagree.
we
are
not
here
to
advocate
abortion.
we
do
not
ask
this
court
to
rule
that
abortion
is
good
or
desirable
in
any
particular
situation.
we
are
here
to
advocate
that
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
woman
will
continue
to
carry
or
will
terminate
a
pregnancy
is
a
decision
that
should
be
made
by
that
individual.
that,
in
fact,
she
has
a
constitutional
right
to
make
that
decision
for
herself
and
that
the
state
has
shown
no
interest
in
interfering
with
that
decision.
our
supplemental
brief
on
page
14
points
out
that
the
brief
of
the
opposition
can’t
quite
decide
when
life
does
begin.
at
one
point,
they
suggest
it’s
when
there’s
implantation.
a
few
pages
later,
they
suggest
it’s
with
conception.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
certainly,
your
honor,
he
may.
he
may
refuse
any
kind
of
medical
procedure
whatsoever.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
here,
it’s
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
by
the
statute
will
force
the
woman
to
continue.
the
woman
should
be
given
that
freedom,
just
as
the
doctor
has
the
freedom
to
decide
what
procedures
he
will
carry
out
and
what
he
will
refuse
to
his
patient.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
okay.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
i
am
urging
that,
in
this
particular
context,
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
that
in
the
baird
versus
eisenstadt
case,
this
court
said
if
the
right
of
privacy
is
to
mean
anything,
it
is
the
right
of
the
individual,
whether
married
or
single,
to
make
determinations
for
themselves.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
cannot
say
this
is
a
woman
of
this
particular
doctor
and
this
particular
woman.
it
is,
it
seems
to
me,
of--
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
and
he
can
say,
“i’m
sorry,
i
don’t
perform
them.”
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
she
goes
elsewhere,
if
she
so
chooses.
if
she
stays
with
that--
you
know,
it’s--
that’s
an
impossible
question.
certainly,
i
don’t
think
the
state
could
say
the
first
doctor
a
woman
goes
to
shall
make
that
determination,
and
she
cannot
go
elsewhere.
ms.
sarah
r.
weddington
okay,
thank
you.
