mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
federal
income
tax
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
raises
a
question
with
which
this
court
is
familiar
--
whether
a
shareholder
in
a
closely
held
corporation
is
entitled
to
business
or
nonbusiness
bad
debt
deduction.
if
he
is
unable
to
collect
a
debt
owed
to
him
by
his
corporation.
the
difference
between
a
business
and
nonbusiness
bad
debt
deduction
is
critical
since
the
former
is
deductible
against
the
ordinary
income
and
maybe
carried
back
as
part
of
a
net
operating
loss,
whereas
the
latter
is
deductible
only
as
a
short
term
capital
loss
and
may
not
be
carried
back
to
offset
the
ordinary
income
prior
years.
this
court’s
decision
in
whipple
against
the
commissioner
in
1963,
settled
the
question
whether
merely
investing
in
a
corporation
is
a
trade
or
business.
the
court
held
that
it
is
not
and
consequently
a
mere
investor
in
a
corporation
who
is
unable
to
recover
his
advances
to
the
corporation,
is
entitled
only
to
nonbusiness
bad
debt
treatment.
on
the
other
hand,
since
the
rendering
of
services
to
a
corporation
for
remuneration
constitutes
a
trade
or
business,
an
employee
who
advances
funds
to
his
corporation
in
order
to
protect
his
job
and
salary
and
who
is
unable
to
collect
the
debt
owed
to
him
by
his
corporation,
is
entitled
to
a
business
bad
debt
deduction.
the
problem
in
this
case
arises
where
a
taxpayer
bears
the
dual
relationship
of
shareholder
and
employee
to
the
corporation.
if
he
were
merely
a
shareholder,
then
as
i
have
said,
he
would
be
entitled
only
to
nonbusiness
bad
debt
treatment
but
if
he
were
only
an
employee
who
advanced
funds
to
protect
his
job
and
salary,
he
would
be
entitled
to
business
bad
debt
treatment.
in
the
dual
status
situation
which
arises
here
however
whether
taxpayer
is
motivated
both
by
desire
to
protect
his
job
and
salary
and
by
desire
to
protect
his
investment,
the
internal
revenue
code
makes
no
provision
for
allocating
the
loss
in
part
to
business
and
in
part
to
nonbusiness.
the
loss
must
be
characterized
in
its
entirety
as
business
or
nonbusiness
in
nature
even
though
the
shareholder
employee
was
motivated
by
both
business
and
nonbusiness
considerations
to
make
a
loan
or
guaranteed
his
corporation’s
debts.
section
166
(d)
of
the
code
is
the
relevant
statute
and
it
is
set
out
on
page
36
of
our
brief.
it
provides
that
the
term
nonbusiness
debt
means
the
debt
other
than
a
debt
created
or
acquired
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business
of
the
taxpayer
or
a
debt
or
loss
from
the
worthlessness
of
which
is
incurred
in
the
taxpayer’s
trade
or
business.
the
pertinent
regulations
are
set
out
on
pages
36
and
37
of
our
brief
and
insofar
as
they
are
relevant
here,
they
provide
as
explicated
in
whipple,
that
a
debt
will
be
considered
a
business
bad
debt,
if
the
loss
resulting
from
the
debts
becoming
worthless
is
proximately
related
to
maintaining
the
taxpayer’s
trade
or
business.
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
is
that
in
a
dual
status
situation
the
test
to
satisfy
only
if
the
dominant
motivation
for
the
taxpayer’s
undertaking
was
to
protect
his
business
interest
as
an
employee
rather
than
his
nonbusiness
interest
as
a
stockholder.
the
position
of
the
respondent
is
that
a
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
business
bad
debt
treatment
even
if
his
dominant
motivation
was
to
protect
his
investment
so
long
as
he
was
significantly
motivated
by
his
business
interest
as
an
employee.
with
this
background,
let
me
turn
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
generes,
the
respondent
and
his
son-in-law
william
kelly,
each
owned
44%
of
the
stock
of
the
kelly-generes
construction
company,
a
corporation
engaged
in
heavy
construction
work,
principally
for
governmental
authorities.
the
remainder
of
the
stock
was
owned
by
a
son
and
another
son-in-law
of
mr.
generes.
the
corporation
had
been
formed
in
1954
as
successor
to
a
partnership
in
which
mr.
generes
and
mr.
kelly
had
been
equal
partners.
mr.
kelly
was
the
vice-president
of
the
corporation,
was
in
charge
of
its
day
to
day
operations
and
received
a
salary
of
$15,000
a
year
for
the
services.
mr.
generes
was
president,
was
principally
responsible
for
obtaining
bank
financing
and
securing
performance
and
bid
bonds
on
construction
jobs
undertaken
by
the
corporation
and
was
paid
a
salary
of
$12,000
a
year.
mr.
generes’
principal
employment
was
as
president
of
a
savings
and
loan
association
for
which
he
worked
full-time
and
received
an
annual
salary
of
$19,000
a
year.
at
a
pretrial
deposition,
mr.
generes
testified
that
he
devoted
about
one
hour
a
week
to
the
affairs
of
the
kelly-generes
construction
corporation.
at
trial,
he
testified
that
he
spent
6-8
hours
a
week
on
the
corporation’s
affairs.
mr.
generes’
original
investment
in
the
corporation
was
$38,900.
in
addition,
he
advanced
funds
to
the
corporation
from
time
to
time
when
it
was
short
of
working
capital
and
also
guaranteed
the
corporation’s
bank
loans
to
enable
the
corporation
to
purchase
machinery
and
equipment.
in
1962,
when
the
corporation
was
in
serious
financial
difficulty,
he
advanced
it
$158,000.
the
corporation
was
required
to
the
furnish
performance
and
payment
bonds
in
connection
with
its
construction
business,
which
was
largely
performed
for
governmental
authorities.
most
of
these
bonds
were
written
by
the
maryland
casualty
company.
from
1954
to
1958,
casualty
as
a
matter
of
course,
required
mr.
generes
to
indemnify
it
with
respect
to
each
bond
issued
to
the
corporation.
bonds
were
issued
on
an
individual
job
basis.
late
in
1958
to
obviate
the
need
for
individual
bonds
on
each
construction
job,
mr.
generes
and
mr.
kelly
acting
for
themselves
individually
and
also
for
the
corporation,
signed
a
blanket
indemnity
agreement
with
maryland
casualty.
under
this
agreement,
casualty
agreed
to
add
as
surety
for
the
corporation
for
up
to
a
million-and-a-half
dollars
on
anyone
job
and
two
million
dollars
overall.
mr.
generes
and
mr.
kelly
in
turn
agreed
to
indemnify
casualty
for
any
loss
it
might
suffer
as
surety.
in
1962,
the
corporation
defaulted
on
two
contracts.
maryland
casualty
made
good
on
the
defaults
and
mr.
mr.
generes
was
called
upon
to
respond
under
his
indemnity
agreement.
he
indemnified
casualty
for
a
$162,000
which
he
was
unable
to
recover
from
the
corporation
because
of
its
bankruptcy.
he
was
also
unable
to
collect
the
$158,000
that
he
had
advanced
to
the
corporation
in
1962
in
direct
loans.
in
his
income
tax
return
for
1962,
mr.
generes
treated
the
loss
on
the
direct
loans
as
a
nonbusiness
bad
debt
and
the
commissioner
allowed
that
loss
and
it
is
not
here
in
dispute.
however,
he
treated
his
indemnification
loss
of
$162,000
as
a
business
bad
debt.
the
proper
treatment
of
that
$162,000
as
business
or
nonbusiness
is
the
sole
issue
before
this
court.
the
case
was
tried
before
a
jury
in
new
orleans.
the
trial
lasted
one
day.
mr.
generes
testified
and
i
refer
now
to
page
67
of
the
record
that
the
only
reason
he
signed
the
indemnity
agreement
with
maryland
casualty
was
to
protect
his
part-time
job
with
the
corporation.
in
response
to
the
question
whether
he
had
given
any
thought
at
all
to
his
investment
in
the
corporation
in
guaranteeing,
and
his
investment
on
my
point
out
it
consisted
both
of
his
stock
interest
and
his
direct
loans
to
the
corporation.
he
testified
and
i
quote,
“no,
i
never
once
gave
it
a
thought.”
and
i
quote
again
from
page
69
of
the
record,
“to
tell
you
the
truth
about
it,
i
never
gave
that
a
thought.
i
never
gave
my
investment
a
thought.”
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
believe
they
are,
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
it
does,
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
he
had
some
dividends
and
i
think
the
record
shows
that
his
income
roughly
with
dividends
and
other
income
averaged
about
$40,000
a
year.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
in
those
days
mr.
justice,
that
was
before
enactment
of
the
revenue
act
of
1962,
so
the
rates
were
somewhat
higher.
i
would
say
40-50%
was
brought,
if
that
is
what
you
are
asking
was
the
marginal
tax
bracket
before
the
enactment
of
the
revenue
act
of
62?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
that
the--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
the
government
would
have
prevailed
mr.
chief
justice.
we
wouldn't
be
here,
no?
on
the
dominant--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
we
might
have
been
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
support
the
verdict
but
we
wouldn't
be
here.
my
point
was
mr.
chief
justice
that
it's
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
the
jury
would
have
found
for
the
taxpayer.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
only
a
question
whether
the
jury’s
finding
was
clearly
erroneous
and
we
would
not
be
in
this
court
on
that.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
correct
sir,
only
with
the
instruction.
after
getting
the
significant
motivation
instruction
to
which
the
chief
justice
has
referred,
the
jury
went
out
shortly
after
five
o’clock
at
the
close
of
this
one-day
trial
and
it
stayed-out
nearly
two
hours.
it
returned
shortly
after
7:00
p.m.
seeking
clarification
of
the
significant
motivation
instruction
and
i
refer
the
court
to
page
129
of
the
record
at
which
the
jury
put
the
following
question
to
the
trial
judge
and
i
quote,
“is
the
question
given
us,
intended
for
us
to
decide
whether
he
signed
the
indemnity
agreement
solely
for
the
protection
of
his
salary,
investment
or
could
it
be
both.”
the
jury
it
seems
clear
to
us
was
somewhat
confused
as
to
how
to
apply
the
so
called
significant
motivation
instruction.
after
coming
back
this
first
time,
shortly
after
seven
o’clock,
the
jury
went
out
for
another
40
minutes
and
it
returned
again
for
clarification
of
the
instruction
and
i
refer
the
court
now
to
page
130
of
the
record.
and
again
at
this
point,
the
jury
asked
and
i
quote,
“would
you
please
reread
your
answer
to
our
question
and
possibly
interpret
it
further,”
and
the
trial
judge
undertook
to
do
that.
the
jury
went
back
to
deliberate
for
the
third
time
and
reached
a
verdict
favorable
to
mr.
generes.
the
government’s
motions
for
judgment
n.o.v.
and
alternatively
for
a
new
trial
were
denied
and
on
the
government's
appeal,
the
fifth
circuit
by
a
divided
vote
held
at
the
jury
had
been
properly
instructed.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
there
is
other
testimony,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
he
had
some
hope
of
getting
dividends
of
that
he
was
trying
to
build
up
in
the
state
for
his
children
and
so
forth
but
that
i
think
is
the
critical
evidence
that
he
did
not
give
his
investment
a
thought.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
and
of
course,
if
the
only
purpose
is
that
purpose,
we
would
not
be
here.
the
whole
basis
of
this
case
is
that
there
is
a
duality
of
purpose
and
a
single
purpose
case,
we
think
is
fairly
clear
under
this
court’s
decision
in
whipple,
where
the
single
purpose
is
investment
purpose
and
under
the
trent
case,
which
we
do
not
disagree
with
where
the
man
is
solely
an
employee,
second
circuit
decision
and
as
required
as
a
condition
to
his
employment.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
correct
and
it
seems
clear
enough
on
this
record
that
the
jury
had
some
difficulty
in
believing
that
that
was
his
sole
purpose
because
if
it
was,
they
would
not
have
to
worry
about
the
what
the
term
significant
meant
as
they
did
worry
about
it
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
any
suggestion
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
the
error
on
this
record
may
have
been
harmless
is
not
well
taken.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
and
because
it
is
obvious
that
the
jury
did
not
believe
that
his
sole
interest
was
as
an
employee
interest,
they
could
have
decided
this,
it
was
five
o’clock,
they
sat
whole.
we
think
it
is
somewhat
unusual
that
a
jury
would
spend
three
hours
on
the
case
like
this
one
when
it
is
anxious
to
get
home
for
dinner.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
about
the
value
sir?
no.
we
know
that
his
basis
in
the
stock
was
$38,900,
the
basis
on
this
stock.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
$162,000
as
of
1962
so
as
far
as
we
are
concerned.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
$12,000
a
year.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
am
sorry,
let
me
go
back
to
get
the
figures
right,
he
had
made
direct
loans
to
the
corporation
of
$158,000.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
are
not
an
issue
here,
but
we
think
they
are
very
relevant,
because
the
taxpayer
treated
those
as
a
nonbusiness
loan,
that
is
an
investment,
so
his
investing
clearly
was
at
least
$158,000,
even
if
the
stock
was
worthless.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
add
the
stock,
it
brings
--
it
assuming
that
it
had
a
fair
market
value
equal
to
its
basis,
we
are
talking
about
an
investment
of
$200,000.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
we
do.
we
are
talking
about
a
guarantee
here
about
two
million
dollars,
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
we
think
that
it
restrains
the
imagination
to
think
that
someone
who
was
solely
an
employee,
solely
an
employee
now
who
is
making
$12,000
a
year
in
a
part-time
job,
who
had
some
$30,000-55,000
in
assets,
who
was
over
70
years
old
would,
if
your
pardon,
the
expression,
go
on
the
hook
for
up
to
two
million
dollars
in
order
to
protect
this
part-time
job.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
$200,000
investment
and
also
he
had
other
motivations
we
think.
after
all,
it
was
his
son-in-law
who
was
running
this
business
and
i
think
another
son-in-law
was
working
in
the
business,
the
stock
was
owned
by
him
individually
by
two
of
his
sons-in-law
and
a
son
and
so
we
think
he
had
significant
personal
motivations
here
as
well
as
nonbusiness
motivations.
our
position
that
business
bad
debt
treatment
should
be
allowed
in
a
dual
status
situation
only
where
the
dominant
motivation
for
the
undertaking
is
protection
of
employment
rests
on
four
considerations.
the
first
of
these
arises
simply
from
the
fact
that
we
are
faced
with
a
situation
here
where
we
must
characterize
a
bad
debt
in
its
entirety
as
business
or
nonbusiness
in
nature,
even
though,
the
taxpayer
was
motivated
by
two
considerations
to
guarantee
his
corporation’s
debts.
now,
the
internal
revenue
code
might
have
provided
him
such
circumstances
that
half
of
the
debt
should
be
treated
as
business
bad
debt
and
half
should
be
treated
as
a
nonbusiness
bad
debt.
but
that
is
not
what
it
does
provide,
the
choice
has
to
be
made.
either
it
is
all
business
or
it
is
all
nonbusiness
and
we
submit
that
purely
from
the
standpoint
of
logic
and
in
the
absence
of
any
overriding
policy
consideration,
it
is
far
more
logical
to
have
the
character
of
the
debt
determined
by
reference
to
the
weightier
consideration
rather
than
by
the
reference
to
a
lesser
consideration.
secondly,
we
have
referred
in
our
brief
to
several
analogous
situations
in
which
the
tax
consequences
are
determined
by
reference
to
the
weightier
consideration.
in
situations
were
an
all
or
nothing
choice
must
be
made
just
as
here
and
the
first
involves
the
business
bad
debt
provision
itself
prior
to
1942,
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
in
whipple,
there
was
no
such
thing
as
business
and
nonbusiness
bad
debts,
they
were
simply
bad
debts
and
whether
they
were
business
and
nonbusiness
or
otherwise,
that
they
went
unrepaid,
they
were
deductible
against
the
ordinary
income.
the
substantial
loophole
developed
in
the
internal
revenue
code
where
loans
would
be
made
to
family
members
and
go
unrepaid
and
taxpayers
would
claim
an
ordinary
deduction
against
for
these
loans.
so
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
congress's
enactment
of
the
business
nonbusiness
dichotomy
in
1942
was
to
close
up
this
loophole.
now
you
could
have
a
situation
where
instead
of
--
as
we
have
here
for
the
most
part,
we
are
talking
about
a
nonbusiness
investment
consideration
against
a
business
consideration,
where
you
have
primarily
a
nonbusiness
personal
consideration
against
a
business
consideration.
now
under
the
test
that
respondent
proposes
the
significant
test,
a
business
bad
debt
would
be
allowed
even
if
the
weightier
consideration
was
its
personal
consideration
and
we
submit
this
would
be
squarely
contrary
to
the
congressional
intent
in
1942.
similarly,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
the
hartman
case,
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
1942
legislation
was
to
put
nonbusiness
investments
in
the
form
of
loans
on
a
footing
with
nonbusiness
investments
in
the
form
of
stock
and
the
courts
have
held
that
where
corporate
stock
is
purchased
both
for
business
reasons
and
investments
reasons,
that
dominant
motivation
is
controlling
and
characterizing
with
that
loss.
again,
to
put
the
two
on
an
equal
footing,
only
the
dominant
standard
can
be
applied.
finally,
we
refer
to
the
fact
that
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
166,
there
are
references
to
applying
the
same
test
as
is
applied
under
section
165,
in
determining
whether
an
expense
is
incurred
or
a
loss
is
incurred
in
a
trade
or
business
or
in
a
transaction
entered
into
for
profit.
and
under
the
section
165
it
is
clear
that
the
dominant
standards
controls.
and
thirdly,
a
point
that
i
referred
to
in
answering
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
think
the
dominant
standards
is
far
easier
to
apply
by
a
jury
than
the
significant
standard
and
we
think
it
is
necessary
only
to
the
point
to
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
and
the
difficulty
that
the
jury
encountered.
and
lastly,
we
rely
on
the
opinion
in
the
whipple
case.
the
gist
of
the
opinion,
it
seems
to
us
is
that
a
presumption
exist
against
the
allowance
of
business
bad
debt
treatment
to
stockholders
whose
interest
on
not
subordinate
to
the
interest
of
other
stockholders
and
this
is
just
as
it
should
be,
because
it
is
a
rare
case
in
which
an
employee
with
no
other
interest
in
the
corporation
would
undertake
to
advance
substantial
funds
to
a
guaranteed
debts
of
his
corporation.
application
of
these
significant
standard
we
believe
would
go
a
long
way
toward
overcoming
the
presumption
in
the
whipple
case
as
it
can
be
seen
from
this
case
itself.
a
taxpayer
maybe
able
to
overcome
it
simply
by
testifying
that
he
did
not
give
his
investment
a
thought.
i
should
like
to
retain
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
record
sir?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
like
to
respond
first
to
the
principal
argument
which
respondent
makes
here,
it
was
the
principal
argument
in
his
brief
which
focuses
on
subsection
capital
a
of
section
166(d)
2,
the
'in
connection
with'
language.
as
i
understand
the
argument
of
respondent,
he
conceives
that
subsection
b
would
not
be
sufficiently
broad
to
allow
a
significant
motivation
standard.
now
first
of
all,
let
me
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
term
proximate
as
it
appears
in
the
regulations
under
that
we
have
quoted
on
page
37
applies
only
to
subsection
b,
that
regulation
was
there
long
before
the
code
was
amended
in
1954
to
add
subsection
a.
and
we
have
pointed
out
on
page
15
of
our
brief
in
footnote
seven,
what
congress's
purpose
was
in
enacting
subsection
a
and
it
is
really
quite
simple.
under
the
law
as
it
existed
before
1954,
a
taxpayer
who
acquired
a
debt
when
he
was
in
a
trade
or
business
and
then
went
out
of
the
trade
or
business
before
a
final
determination
was
made
as
to
the
worthlessness
of
the
debt
was
entitled
only
to
a
nonbusiness
bad
debt.
the
sole
purpose
of
subsection
a,
as
we
have
stated
in
footnote
seven
was
to
make
it
clear
that
if
the
taxpayer
went
out
of
business
after
having
acquired
a
debt
in
a
course
of
a
trade
of
a
trade
or
business
and
then
the
debt
became
worthless,
he
would
get
a
business
bad
debt.
but
this
court
to
read
in
to
that
edition
of
subsection
a,
all
that
respondent
urges,
it
seems
to
us
would
be
making
an
awful
lot
out
of
a
little.
and
i
urge
the
court
to
read
legislative
history
of
subsection
a,
it
is
very
short
and
that
is
the
sole
purpose
of
the
addition.
as
far
as
the
absence
of
the
word
primarily,
i
would
make
two
points,
first
it
seems
to
us
that
just
as
we
are
trying
to
read
the
word
'primarily'
into
the
statute,
the
respondent
is
trying
to
read
the
word
'significantly'
into
the
statute.
we
think
there
is
a
gap
there
that
this
court
has
to
fill
and
it
is
not
a
one
sided
gap.
it
has
to
be
filled
one
way
or
the
other.
congress
simply
did
not
contemplate
this
dual
status
case
when
it
enacted
the
statute.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
do
not
think
we
would
be
here
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
think
if
they
had
put
the
word
significantly
and
we
would
not
be
here
either.
there
is
a
gap
there
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
they
have
but
under
one
section
165(c)
2
which
appears
on
page
35
of
our
brief,
it
is
referred
to
there
as
whether
a
loss
is
incurred
in
the
transaction
entered
into
the
profit
and
the
very
same
second
circuit
which
held
adversely
to
the
government
in
waddell
has
held
that
if
loss
incurred
in
a
transaction
entered
into
for
profit,
you
have
to
look
at
the
primary
motivation
of
the
taxpayer.
we
have
cited
the
austin
case
in
our
brief
to
that
effect.
the
taxpayer
there
purchased
a
residence
both
for
personal
purposes
and
to
make
a
profit.
it
was
found
that
the
primary
purpose
was
personal
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
case
and
the
word
'primarily'
does
not
appear
in
section
165(c)
2
as
well
as
in
section
166(d)
as
far
as
the
word
proximate,
we
would
only
note
again
that
so
far
as
the
tort
law
is
concerned,
the
considerations
are
entirely
different.
you
can
hold
more
than
one
tort
fees
are
libel.
here,
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
fact,
what
choice
has
to
be
made?
that
simply
is
not
the
case
in
the
tort
law,
you
can
hold
two
or
three
or
a
greater
number
tort
fees
as
libel
for
single
tort.
and
i
guess,
i
even
pointed
out
except
in
passing
that
the
considerations
that
have
expanded
notions
of
proximate
cause
are
wholly
different
from
those
that
this
court
has
to
take
into
account
in
deciding
this
case.
one
final
point
mr.
nathan
would
have
this
court
draw
a
severe
distinction
between
loans
and
guarantees.
but
we
do
not
think
that
is
permissible
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
putnam
case.
mr.
justice
brennan,
their
writing
for
the
court
held
loans
and
guarantees
ought
to
be
considered
the
same
for
purposes
of
interpretation
of
the
bad
debt
provision
of
the
code.
for
these
reasons
then
we
urge
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
of
course
agree
with
that.
i
assume
that
the
–
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
agreed
mr.
justice
white
that
the
trent
case
was
correctly
decided.
that
is
where
the
person
is
solely
an
employee
and
is
required
as
a
condition
to
continuing
employment
to
make
a
loan
or
guarantee
its
corporation’s
debts,
we
would
agree
that
that
is
incurred
in
a
trade
or
business.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
is
deductible
as
a
capital
loss
but
not
as
an
ordinary
loss.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right,
but
it
is
a
transaction,
are
you
talking
about
the
stock
investment?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
an
investment
loss?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
is
deductible.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
is.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right
because
it
is
subject
to
the
capital
asset
limitations.
thank
you.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
federal
income
tax
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
raises
a
question
with
which
this
court
is
familiar
--
whether
a
shareholder
in
a
closely
held
corporation
is
entitled
to
business
or
nonbusiness
bad
debt
deduction.
if
he
is
unable
to
collect
a
debt
owed
to
him
by
his
corporation.
the
difference
between
a
business
and
nonbusiness
bad
debt
deduction
is
critical
since
the
former
is
deductible
against
the
ordinary
income
and
maybe
carried
back
as
part
of
a
net
operating
loss,
whereas
the
latter
is
deductible
only
as
a
short
term
capital
loss
and
may
not
be
carried
back
to
offset
the
ordinary
income
prior
years.
this
court’s
decision
in
whipple
against
the
commissioner
in
1963,
settled
the
question
whether
merely
investing
in
a
corporation
is
a
trade
or
business.
the
court
held
that
it
is
not
and
consequently
a
mere
investor
in
a
corporation
who
is
unable
to
recover
his
advances
to
the
corporation,
is
entitled
only
to
nonbusiness
bad
debt
treatment.
on
the
other
hand,
since
the
rendering
of
services
to
a
corporation
for
remuneration
constitutes
a
trade
or
business,
an
employee
who
advances
funds
to
his
corporation
in
order
to
protect
his
job
and
salary
and
who
is
unable
to
collect
the
debt
owed
to
him
by
his
corporation,
is
entitled
to
a
business
bad
debt
deduction.
the
problem
in
this
case
arises
where
a
taxpayer
bears
the
dual
relationship
of
shareholder
and
employee
to
the
corporation.
if
he
were
merely
a
shareholder,
then
as
i
have
said,
he
would
be
entitled
only
to
nonbusiness
bad
debt
treatment
but
if
he
were
only
an
employee
who
advanced
funds
to
protect
his
job
and
salary,
he
would
be
entitled
to
business
bad
debt
treatment.
in
the
dual
status
situation
which
arises
here
however
whether
taxpayer
is
motivated
both
by
desire
to
protect
his
job
and
salary
and
by
desire
to
protect
his
investment,
the
internal
revenue
code
makes
no
provision
for
allocating
the
loss
in
part
to
business
and
in
part
to
nonbusiness.
the
loss
must
be
characterized
in
its
entirety
as
business
or
nonbusiness
in
nature
even
though
the
shareholder
employee
was
motivated
by
both
business
and
nonbusiness
considerations
to
make
a
loan
or
guaranteed
his
corporation’s
debts.
section
166
(d)
of
the
code
is
the
relevant
statute
and
it
is
set
out
on
page
36
of
our
brief.
it
provides
that
the
term
nonbusiness
debt
means
the
debt
other
than
a
debt
created
or
acquired
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business
of
the
taxpayer
or
a
debt
or
loss
from
the
worthlessness
of
which
is
incurred
in
the
taxpayer’s
trade
or
business.
the
pertinent
regulations
are
set
out
on
pages
36
and
37
of
our
brief
and
insofar
as
they
are
relevant
here,
they
provide
as
explicated
in
whipple,
that
a
debt
will
be
considered
a
business
bad
debt,
if
the
loss
resulting
from
the
debts
becoming
worthless
is
proximately
related
to
maintaining
the
taxpayer’s
trade
or
business.
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
is
that
in
a
dual
status
situation
the
test
to
satisfy
only
if
the
dominant
motivation
for
the
taxpayer’s
undertaking
was
to
protect
his
business
interest
as
an
employee
rather
than
his
nonbusiness
interest
as
a
stockholder.
the
position
of
the
respondent
is
that
a
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
business
bad
debt
treatment
even
if
his
dominant
motivation
was
to
protect
his
investment
so
long
as
he
was
significantly
motivated
by
his
business
interest
as
an
employee.
with
this
background,
let
me
turn
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
generes,
the
respondent
and
his
son-in-law
william
kelly,
each
owned
44%
of
the
stock
of
the
kelly-generes
construction
company,
a
corporation
engaged
in
heavy
construction
work,
principally
for
governmental
authorities.
the
remainder
of
the
stock
was
owned
by
a
son
and
another
son-in-law
of
mr.
generes.
the
corporation
had
been
formed
in
1954
as
successor
to
a
partnership
in
which
mr.
generes
and
mr.
kelly
had
been
equal
partners.
mr.
kelly
was
the
vice-president
of
the
corporation,
was
in
charge
of
its
day
to
day
operations
and
received
a
salary
of
$15,000
a
year
for
the
services.
mr.
generes
was
president,
was
principally
responsible
for
obtaining
bank
financing
and
securing
performance
and
bid
bonds
on
construction
jobs
undertaken
by
the
corporation
and
was
paid
a
salary
of
$12,000
a
year.
mr.
generes’
principal
employment
was
as
president
of
a
savings
and
loan
association
for
which
he
worked
full-time
and
received
an
annual
salary
of
$19,000
a
year.
at
a
pretrial
deposition,
mr.
generes
testified
that
he
devoted
about
one
hour
a
week
to
the
affairs
of
the
kelly-generes
construction
corporation.
at
trial,
he
testified
that
he
spent
6-8
hours
a
week
on
the
corporation’s
affairs.
mr.
generes’
original
investment
in
the
corporation
was
$38,900.
in
addition,
he
advanced
funds
to
the
corporation
from
time
to
time
when
it
was
short
of
working
capital
and
also
guaranteed
the
corporation’s
bank
loans
to
enable
the
corporation
to
purchase
machinery
and
equipment.
in
1962,
when
the
corporation
was
in
serious
financial
difficulty,
he
advanced
it
$158,000.
the
corporation
was
required
to
the
furnish
performance
and
payment
bonds
in
connection
with
its
construction
business,
which
was
largely
performed
for
governmental
authorities.
most
of
these
bonds
were
written
by
the
maryland
casualty
company.
from
1954
to
1958,
casualty
as
a
matter
of
course,
required
mr.
generes
to
indemnify
it
with
respect
to
each
bond
issued
to
the
corporation.
bonds
were
issued
on
an
individual
job
basis.
late
in
1958
to
obviate
the
need
for
individual
bonds
on
each
construction
job,
mr.
generes
and
mr.
kelly
acting
for
themselves
individually
and
also
for
the
corporation,
signed
a
blanket
indemnity
agreement
with
maryland
casualty.
under
this
agreement,
casualty
agreed
to
add
as
surety
for
the
corporation
for
up
to
a
million-and-a-half
dollars
on
anyone
job
and
two
million
dollars
overall.
mr.
generes
and
mr.
kelly
in
turn
agreed
to
indemnify
casualty
for
any
loss
it
might
suffer
as
surety.
in
1962,
the
corporation
defaulted
on
two
contracts.
maryland
casualty
made
good
on
the
defaults
and
mr.
mr.
generes
was
called
upon
to
respond
under
his
indemnity
agreement.
he
indemnified
casualty
for
a
$162,000
which
he
was
unable
to
recover
from
the
corporation
because
of
its
bankruptcy.
he
was
also
unable
to
collect
the
$158,000
that
he
had
advanced
to
the
corporation
in
1962
in
direct
loans.
in
his
income
tax
return
for
1962,
mr.
generes
treated
the
loss
on
the
direct
loans
as
a
nonbusiness
bad
debt
and
the
commissioner
allowed
that
loss
and
it
is
not
here
in
dispute.
however,
he
treated
his
indemnification
loss
of
$162,000
as
a
business
bad
debt.
the
proper
treatment
of
that
$162,000
as
business
or
nonbusiness
is
the
sole
issue
before
this
court.
the
case
was
tried
before
a
jury
in
new
orleans.
the
trial
lasted
one
day.
mr.
generes
testified
and
i
refer
now
to
page
67
of
the
record
that
the
only
reason
he
signed
the
indemnity
agreement
with
maryland
casualty
was
to
protect
his
part-time
job
with
the
corporation.
in
response
to
the
question
whether
he
had
given
any
thought
at
all
to
his
investment
in
the
corporation
in
guaranteeing,
and
his
investment
on
my
point
out
it
consisted
both
of
his
stock
interest
and
his
direct
loans
to
the
corporation.
he
testified
and
i
quote,
“no,
i
never
once
gave
it
a
thought.”
and
i
quote
again
from
page
69
of
the
record,
“to
tell
you
the
truth
about
it,
i
never
gave
that
a
thought.
i
never
gave
my
investment
a
thought.”
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
believe
they
are,
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
it
does,
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
he
had
some
dividends
and
i
think
the
record
shows
that
his
income
roughly
with
dividends
and
other
income
averaged
about
$40,000
a
year.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
in
those
days
mr.
justice,
that
was
before
enactment
of
the
revenue
act
of
1962,
so
the
rates
were
somewhat
higher.
i
would
say
40-50%
was
brought,
if
that
is
what
you
are
asking
was
the
marginal
tax
bracket
before
the
enactment
of
the
revenue
act
of
62?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
that
the--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
the
government
would
have
prevailed
mr.
chief
justice.
we
wouldn't
be
here,
no?
on
the
dominant--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
we
might
have
been
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
support
the
verdict
but
we
wouldn't
be
here.
my
point
was
mr.
chief
justice
that
it's
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
the
jury
would
have
found
for
the
taxpayer.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
only
a
question
whether
the
jury’s
finding
was
clearly
erroneous
and
we
would
not
be
in
this
court
on
that.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
correct
sir,
only
with
the
instruction.
after
getting
the
significant
motivation
instruction
to
which
the
chief
justice
has
referred,
the
jury
went
out
shortly
after
five
o’clock
at
the
close
of
this
one-day
trial
and
it
stayed-out
nearly
two
hours.
it
returned
shortly
after
7:00
p.m.
seeking
clarification
of
the
significant
motivation
instruction
and
i
refer
the
court
to
page
129
of
the
record
at
which
the
jury
put
the
following
question
to
the
trial
judge
and
i
quote,
“is
the
question
given
us,
intended
for
us
to
decide
whether
he
signed
the
indemnity
agreement
solely
for
the
protection
of
his
salary,
investment
or
could
it
be
both.”
the
jury
it
seems
clear
to
us
was
somewhat
confused
as
to
how
to
apply
the
so
called
significant
motivation
instruction.
after
coming
back
this
first
time,
shortly
after
seven
o’clock,
the
jury
went
out
for
another
40
minutes
and
it
returned
again
for
clarification
of
the
instruction
and
i
refer
the
court
now
to
page
130
of
the
record.
and
again
at
this
point,
the
jury
asked
and
i
quote,
“would
you
please
reread
your
answer
to
our
question
and
possibly
interpret
it
further,”
and
the
trial
judge
undertook
to
do
that.
the
jury
went
back
to
deliberate
for
the
third
time
and
reached
a
verdict
favorable
to
mr.
generes.
the
government’s
motions
for
judgment
n.o.v.
and
alternatively
for
a
new
trial
were
denied
and
on
the
government's
appeal,
the
fifth
circuit
by
a
divided
vote
held
at
the
jury
had
been
properly
instructed.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
there
is
other
testimony,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
he
had
some
hope
of
getting
dividends
of
that
he
was
trying
to
build
up
in
the
state
for
his
children
and
so
forth
but
that
i
think
is
the
critical
evidence
that
he
did
not
give
his
investment
a
thought.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
and
of
course,
if
the
only
purpose
is
that
purpose,
we
would
not
be
here.
the
whole
basis
of
this
case
is
that
there
is
a
duality
of
purpose
and
a
single
purpose
case,
we
think
is
fairly
clear
under
this
court’s
decision
in
whipple,
where
the
single
purpose
is
investment
purpose
and
under
the
trent
case,
which
we
do
not
disagree
with
where
the
man
is
solely
an
employee,
second
circuit
decision
and
as
required
as
a
condition
to
his
employment.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
correct
and
it
seems
clear
enough
on
this
record
that
the
jury
had
some
difficulty
in
believing
that
that
was
his
sole
purpose
because
if
it
was,
they
would
not
have
to
worry
about
the
what
the
term
significant
meant
as
they
did
worry
about
it
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
any
suggestion
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
the
error
on
this
record
may
have
been
harmless
is
not
well
taken.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
and
because
it
is
obvious
that
the
jury
did
not
believe
that
his
sole
interest
was
as
an
employee
interest,
they
could
have
decided
this,
it
was
five
o’clock,
they
sat
whole.
we
think
it
is
somewhat
unusual
that
a
jury
would
spend
three
hours
on
the
case
like
this
one
when
it
is
anxious
to
get
home
for
dinner.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
about
the
value
sir?
no.
we
know
that
his
basis
in
the
stock
was
$38,900,
the
basis
on
this
stock.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
$162,000
as
of
1962
so
as
far
as
we
are
concerned.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
$12,000
a
year.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
am
sorry,
let
me
go
back
to
get
the
figures
right,
he
had
made
direct
loans
to
the
corporation
of
$158,000.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
are
not
an
issue
here,
but
we
think
they
are
very
relevant,
because
the
taxpayer
treated
those
as
a
nonbusiness
loan,
that
is
an
investment,
so
his
investing
clearly
was
at
least
$158,000,
even
if
the
stock
was
worthless.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
add
the
stock,
it
brings
--
it
assuming
that
it
had
a
fair
market
value
equal
to
its
basis,
we
are
talking
about
an
investment
of
$200,000.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
we
do.
we
are
talking
about
a
guarantee
here
about
two
million
dollars,
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
we
think
that
it
restrains
the
imagination
to
think
that
someone
who
was
solely
an
employee,
solely
an
employee
now
who
is
making
$12,000
a
year
in
a
part-time
job,
who
had
some
$30,000-55,000
in
assets,
who
was
over
70
years
old
would,
if
your
pardon,
the
expression,
go
on
the
hook
for
up
to
two
million
dollars
in
order
to
protect
this
part-time
job.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
$200,000
investment
and
also
he
had
other
motivations
we
think.
after
all,
it
was
his
son-in-law
who
was
running
this
business
and
i
think
another
son-in-law
was
working
in
the
business,
the
stock
was
owned
by
him
individually
by
two
of
his
sons-in-law
and
a
son
and
so
we
think
he
had
significant
personal
motivations
here
as
well
as
nonbusiness
motivations.
our
position
that
business
bad
debt
treatment
should
be
allowed
in
a
dual
status
situation
only
where
the
dominant
motivation
for
the
undertaking
is
protection
of
employment
rests
on
four
considerations.
the
first
of
these
arises
simply
from
the
fact
that
we
are
faced
with
a
situation
here
where
we
must
characterize
a
bad
debt
in
its
entirety
as
business
or
nonbusiness
in
nature,
even
though,
the
taxpayer
was
motivated
by
two
considerations
to
guarantee
his
corporation’s
debts.
now,
the
internal
revenue
code
might
have
provided
him
such
circumstances
that
half
of
the
debt
should
be
treated
as
business
bad
debt
and
half
should
be
treated
as
a
nonbusiness
bad
debt.
but
that
is
not
what
it
does
provide,
the
choice
has
to
be
made.
either
it
is
all
business
or
it
is
all
nonbusiness
and
we
submit
that
purely
from
the
standpoint
of
logic
and
in
the
absence
of
any
overriding
policy
consideration,
it
is
far
more
logical
to
have
the
character
of
the
debt
determined
by
reference
to
the
weightier
consideration
rather
than
by
the
reference
to
a
lesser
consideration.
secondly,
we
have
referred
in
our
brief
to
several
analogous
situations
in
which
the
tax
consequences
are
determined
by
reference
to
the
weightier
consideration.
in
situations
were
an
all
or
nothing
choice
must
be
made
just
as
here
and
the
first
involves
the
business
bad
debt
provision
itself
prior
to
1942,
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
in
whipple,
there
was
no
such
thing
as
business
and
nonbusiness
bad
debts,
they
were
simply
bad
debts
and
whether
they
were
business
and
nonbusiness
or
otherwise,
that
they
went
unrepaid,
they
were
deductible
against
the
ordinary
income.
the
substantial
loophole
developed
in
the
internal
revenue
code
where
loans
would
be
made
to
family
members
and
go
unrepaid
and
taxpayers
would
claim
an
ordinary
deduction
against
for
these
loans.
so
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
congress's
enactment
of
the
business
nonbusiness
dichotomy
in
1942
was
to
close
up
this
loophole.
now
you
could
have
a
situation
where
instead
of
--
as
we
have
here
for
the
most
part,
we
are
talking
about
a
nonbusiness
investment
consideration
against
a
business
consideration,
where
you
have
primarily
a
nonbusiness
personal
consideration
against
a
business
consideration.
now
under
the
test
that
respondent
proposes
the
significant
test,
a
business
bad
debt
would
be
allowed
even
if
the
weightier
consideration
was
its
personal
consideration
and
we
submit
this
would
be
squarely
contrary
to
the
congressional
intent
in
1942.
similarly,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
the
hartman
case,
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
1942
legislation
was
to
put
nonbusiness
investments
in
the
form
of
loans
on
a
footing
with
nonbusiness
investments
in
the
form
of
stock
and
the
courts
have
held
that
where
corporate
stock
is
purchased
both
for
business
reasons
and
investments
reasons,
that
dominant
motivation
is
controlling
and
characterizing
with
that
loss.
again,
to
put
the
two
on
an
equal
footing,
only
the
dominant
standard
can
be
applied.
finally,
we
refer
to
the
fact
that
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
166,
there
are
references
to
applying
the
same
test
as
is
applied
under
section
165,
in
determining
whether
an
expense
is
incurred
or
a
loss
is
incurred
in
a
trade
or
business
or
in
a
transaction
entered
into
for
profit.
and
under
the
section
165
it
is
clear
that
the
dominant
standards
controls.
and
thirdly,
a
point
that
i
referred
to
in
answering
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
think
the
dominant
standards
is
far
easier
to
apply
by
a
jury
than
the
significant
standard
and
we
think
it
is
necessary
only
to
the
point
to
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
and
the
difficulty
that
the
jury
encountered.
and
lastly,
we
rely
on
the
opinion
in
the
whipple
case.
the
gist
of
the
opinion,
it
seems
to
us
is
that
a
presumption
exist
against
the
allowance
of
business
bad
debt
treatment
to
stockholders
whose
interest
on
not
subordinate
to
the
interest
of
other
stockholders
and
this
is
just
as
it
should
be,
because
it
is
a
rare
case
in
which
an
employee
with
no
other
interest
in
the
corporation
would
undertake
to
advance
substantial
funds
to
a
guaranteed
debts
of
his
corporation.
application
of
these
significant
standard
we
believe
would
go
a
long
way
toward
overcoming
the
presumption
in
the
whipple
case
as
it
can
be
seen
from
this
case
itself.
a
taxpayer
maybe
able
to
overcome
it
simply
by
testifying
that
he
did
not
give
his
investment
a
thought.
i
should
like
to
retain
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
record
sir?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
like
to
respond
first
to
the
principal
argument
which
respondent
makes
here,
it
was
the
principal
argument
in
his
brief
which
focuses
on
subsection
capital
a
of
section
166(d)
2,
the
'in
connection
with'
language.
as
i
understand
the
argument
of
respondent,
he
conceives
that
subsection
b
would
not
be
sufficiently
broad
to
allow
a
significant
motivation
standard.
now
first
of
all,
let
me
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
term
proximate
as
it
appears
in
the
regulations
under
that
we
have
quoted
on
page
37
applies
only
to
subsection
b,
that
regulation
was
there
long
before
the
code
was
amended
in
1954
to
add
subsection
a.
and
we
have
pointed
out
on
page
15
of
our
brief
in
footnote
seven,
what
congress's
purpose
was
in
enacting
subsection
a
and
it
is
really
quite
simple.
under
the
law
as
it
existed
before
1954,
a
taxpayer
who
acquired
a
debt
when
he
was
in
a
trade
or
business
and
then
went
out
of
the
trade
or
business
before
a
final
determination
was
made
as
to
the
worthlessness
of
the
debt
was
entitled
only
to
a
nonbusiness
bad
debt.
the
sole
purpose
of
subsection
a,
as
we
have
stated
in
footnote
seven
was
to
make
it
clear
that
if
the
taxpayer
went
out
of
business
after
having
acquired
a
debt
in
a
course
of
a
trade
of
a
trade
or
business
and
then
the
debt
became
worthless,
he
would
get
a
business
bad
debt.
but
this
court
to
read
in
to
that
edition
of
subsection
a,
all
that
respondent
urges,
it
seems
to
us
would
be
making
an
awful
lot
out
of
a
little.
and
i
urge
the
court
to
read
legislative
history
of
subsection
a,
it
is
very
short
and
that
is
the
sole
purpose
of
the
addition.
as
far
as
the
absence
of
the
word
primarily,
i
would
make
two
points,
first
it
seems
to
us
that
just
as
we
are
trying
to
read
the
word
'primarily'
into
the
statute,
the
respondent
is
trying
to
read
the
word
'significantly'
into
the
statute.
we
think
there
is
a
gap
there
that
this
court
has
to
fill
and
it
is
not
a
one
sided
gap.
it
has
to
be
filled
one
way
or
the
other.
congress
simply
did
not
contemplate
this
dual
status
case
when
it
enacted
the
statute.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
do
not
think
we
would
be
here
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
think
if
they
had
put
the
word
significantly
and
we
would
not
be
here
either.
there
is
a
gap
there
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
they
have
but
under
one
section
165(c)
2
which
appears
on
page
35
of
our
brief,
it
is
referred
to
there
as
whether
a
loss
is
incurred
in
the
transaction
entered
into
the
profit
and
the
very
same
second
circuit
which
held
adversely
to
the
government
in
waddell
has
held
that
if
loss
incurred
in
a
transaction
entered
into
for
profit,
you
have
to
look
at
the
primary
motivation
of
the
taxpayer.
we
have
cited
the
austin
case
in
our
brief
to
that
effect.
the
taxpayer
there
purchased
a
residence
both
for
personal
purposes
and
to
make
a
profit.
it
was
found
that
the
primary
purpose
was
personal
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
case
and
the
word
'primarily'
does
not
appear
in
section
165(c)
2
as
well
as
in
section
166(d)
as
far
as
the
word
proximate,
we
would
only
note
again
that
so
far
as
the
tort
law
is
concerned,
the
considerations
are
entirely
different.
you
can
hold
more
than
one
tort
fees
are
libel.
here,
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
fact,
what
choice
has
to
be
made?
that
simply
is
not
the
case
in
the
tort
law,
you
can
hold
two
or
three
or
a
greater
number
tort
fees
as
libel
for
single
tort.
and
i
guess,
i
even
pointed
out
except
in
passing
that
the
considerations
that
have
expanded
notions
of
proximate
cause
are
wholly
different
from
those
that
this
court
has
to
take
into
account
in
deciding
this
case.
one
final
point
mr.
nathan
would
have
this
court
draw
a
severe
distinction
between
loans
and
guarantees.
but
we
do
not
think
that
is
permissible
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
putnam
case.
mr.
justice
brennan,
their
writing
for
the
court
held
loans
and
guarantees
ought
to
be
considered
the
same
for
purposes
of
interpretation
of
the
bad
debt
provision
of
the
code.
for
these
reasons
then
we
urge
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
of
course
agree
with
that.
i
assume
that
the
–
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
agreed
mr.
justice
white
that
the
trent
case
was
correctly
decided.
that
is
where
the
person
is
solely
an
employee
and
is
required
as
a
condition
to
continuing
employment
to
make
a
loan
or
guarantee
its
corporation’s
debts,
we
would
agree
that
that
is
incurred
in
a
trade
or
business.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
is
deductible
as
a
capital
loss
but
not
as
an
ordinary
loss.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right,
but
it
is
a
transaction,
are
you
talking
about
the
stock
investment?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
an
investment
loss?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
is
deductible.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
it
is.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
right
because
it
is
subject
to
the
capital
asset
limitations.
thank
you.
