mr.

would
you
agree
that
the

would
have

test?
chief

i
will

if

it

it

would

chief

it

that

mr.

you
may

it

chief

but,
i
understand
that
argument
being
made
by
the
jury
and
i
assume
you
argued
that
proposition
to
the
jury.
chief

warren
e.

and
perhaps
you
would
have
prevailed
with
the

even
under

instruction.
chief

your

the

is
that
the

issue
in

chief

suppose
that

take
that
approach
mr.

we

this

you

someone
that
he

chief

e.

i
suggest
contrary,
mr.
nathan,
it
would
be
quite
low
premium
for
an

a
high
premiums

low
premium

it
